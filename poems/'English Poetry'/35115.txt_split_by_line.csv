131,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
132,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","St. George he was for England,"
133,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And before he killed the dragon
134,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He drank a pint of English ale
135,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Out of an English flagon.
136,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",For though he fast right readily
137,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","In hair-shirt or in mail,"
138,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",It isn't safe to give him cakes
139,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Unless you give him ale.
140,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
141,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","St. George he was for England,"
142,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And right gallantly set free
143,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The lady left for dragon's meat
144,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And tied up to a tree;
145,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But since he stood for England
146,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And knew what England means,"
147,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Unless you give him bacon
148,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",You mustn't give him beans.
149,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
150,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","St. George he is for England,"
151,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And shall wear the shield he wore
152,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",When we go out in armour
153,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",With the battle-cross before.
154,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But though he is jolly company
155,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And very pleased to dine,"
156,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",It isn't safe to give him nuts
157,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Unless you give him wine.

163,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
164,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
165,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Old Noah he had an ostrich farm and fowls on the largest scale,"
166,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","He ate his egg with a ladle in an egg-cup big as a pail,"
167,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And the soup he took was Elephant Soup and the fish he took was Whale,"
168,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But they all were small to the cellar he took when he set out to sail,"
169,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And Noah he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine,"
170,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","""I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine."""
171,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
172,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blinding off the brink
173,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","As if it would wash the stars away as suds go down a sink,"
174,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The seven heavens came roaring down for the throats of hell to drink,"
175,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And Noah he cocked his eye and said, ""It looks like rain, I think,"
176,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The water has drowned the Matterhorn as deep as a Mendip mine,"
177,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine."""
178,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
179,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But Noah he sinned, and we have sinned; on tipsy feet we trod,"
180,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Till a great big black teetotaller was sent to us for a rod,"
181,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And you can't get wine at a P.S.A., or chapel, or Eisteddfod,"
182,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","For the Curse of Water has come again because of the wrath of God,"
183,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And water is on the Bishop's board and the Higher Thinker's shrine,"
184,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine.

189,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The Song Against Grocers
190,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
191,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
192,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",God made the wicked Grocer
193,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","For a mystery and a sign,"
194,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",That men might shun the awful shops
195,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And go to inns to dine;
196,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Where the bacon's on the rafter
197,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And the wine is in the wood,"
198,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And God that made good laughter
199,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Has seen that they are good.
200,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
201,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The evil-hearted Grocer
202,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Would call his mother ""Ma'am,"""
203,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And bow at her and bob at her,"
204,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Her aged soul to damn,"
205,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And rub his horrid hands and ask
206,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","What article was next,"
207,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Though =mortis in articulo=
208,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Should be her proper text.
209,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
210,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","His props are not his children,"
211,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But pert lads underpaid,"
212,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Who call out ""Cash!"" and bang about"
213,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",To work his wicked trade;
214,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He keeps a lady in a cage
215,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Most cruelly all day,"
216,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And makes her count and calls her ""Miss"""
217,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Until she fades away.
218,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
219,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The righteous minds of innkeepers
220,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Induce them now and then
221,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",To crack a bottle with a friend
222,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Or treat unmoneyed men,"
223,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But who hath seen the Grocer
224,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Treat housemaids to his teas
225,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Or crack a bottle of fish-sauce
226,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Or stand a man a cheese?
227,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
228,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He sells us sands of Araby
229,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",As sugar for cash down;
230,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He sweeps his shop and sells the dust
231,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The purest salt in town,"
232,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He crams with cans of poisoned meat
233,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Poor subjects of the King,"
234,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And when they die by thousands
235,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Why, he laughs like anything."
236,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
237,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The wicked Grocer groces
238,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","In spirits and in wine,"
239,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Not frankly and in fellowship
240,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",As men in inns do dine;
241,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But packed with soap and sardines
242,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And carried off by grooms,"
243,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",For to be snatched by Duchesses
244,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And drunk in dressing-rooms.
245,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
246,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The hell-instructed Grocer
247,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Has a temple made of tin,"
248,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And the ruin of good innkeepers
249,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Is loudly urged therein;
250,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But now the sands are running out
251,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","From sugar of a sort,"
252,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The Grocer trembles; for his time,"
253,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Just like his weight, is short."

256,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
257,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
258,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The Rolling English Road
259,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
260,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
261,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode,"
262,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.
263,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,"
264,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;"
265,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread"
266,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.
267,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
268,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,"
269,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire;
270,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But I did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed
271,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,"
272,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Where you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands,"
273,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.
274,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
275,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run
276,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Behind him; and the hedges all strengthing in the sun?
277,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,"
278,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.
279,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","God pardon us, nor harden us; we did not see so clear"
280,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.
281,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
282,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,"
283,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,"
284,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,"
285,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;
286,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,"
287,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.
288,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
289,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
290,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
291,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
292,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The Song of Quoodle
293,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
294,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
295,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","They haven't got no noses,"
296,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The fallen sons of Eve;
297,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Even the smell of roses
298,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Is not what they supposes;
299,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But more than mind discloses
300,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And more than men believe.
301,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
302,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","They haven't got no noses,"
303,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",They cannot even tell
304,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",When door and darkness closes
305,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The park a Jew encloses,"
306,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Where even the Law of Moses
307,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Will let you steal a smell.
308,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
309,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The brilliant smell of water,"
310,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The brave smell of a stone,"
311,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The smell of dew and thunder,"
312,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The old bones buried under,"
313,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Are things in which they blunder
314,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And err, if left alone."
315,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
316,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The wind from winter forests,"
317,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The scent of scentless flowers,"
318,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The breath of brides' adorning,"
319,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The smell of snare and warning,"
320,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","The smell of Sunday morning,"
321,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",God gave to us for ours.
322,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
323,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",. . . . .
324,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
325,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And Quoodle here discloses
326,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","All things that Quoodle can,"
327,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","They haven't got no noses,"
328,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","They haven't got no noses,"
329,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And goodness only knowses
330,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The Noselessness of Man.
331,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
332,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
333,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
334,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
335,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Pioneers, O Pioneers"
336,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
337,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
338,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Nebuchadnezzar the King of the Jews
339,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Suffered from new and original views,"
340,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","He crawled on his hands and knees, it's said,"
341,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",With grass in his mouth and a crown on his head.
342,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","With a wowtyiddly, etc."
343,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
344,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Those in traditional paths that trod
345,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Thought the thing was a curse from God,"
346,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",But a Pioneer men always abuse
347,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Like Nebuchadnezzar the King of the Jews.
348,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
349,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Black Lord Foulon the Frenchman slew
350,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Thought it a Futurist thing to do.
351,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He offered them grass instead of bread.
352,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",So they stuffed him with grass when they cut off his head.
353,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","With a wowtyiddly, etc."
354,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
355,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",For the pride of his soul he perished then--
356,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But of course it is always of Pride that men,"
357,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","A Man in Advance of his Age accuse,"
358,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Like Nebuchadnezzar the King of the Jews.
359,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
360,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Simeon Scudder of Styx, in Maine,"
361,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Thought of the thing and was at it again.
362,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He gave good grass and water in pails
363,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",To a thousand Irishmen hammering rails.
364,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","With a wowtyiddly, etc."
365,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
366,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Appetites differ; and tied to a stake
367,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",He was tarred and feathered for Conscience' Sake.
368,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But stoning the prophets is ancient news,"
369,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Like Nebuchadnezzar the King of the Jews.
370,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
371,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
372,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
373,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
374,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",The Logical Vegetarian
375,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
376,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
377,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","""Why shouldn't I have a purely vegetarian drink? Why shouldn't I take"
378,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","vegetables in their highest form, so to speak? The modest vegetarians"
379,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","ought obviously to stick to wine or beer, plain vegetarian drinks,"
380,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","instead of filling their goblets with the blood of bulls and elephants,"
381,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","as all conventional meat-eaters do, I suppose.""--Dalroy."
382,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
383,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","You will find me drinking rum,"
384,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Like a sailor in a slum,"
385,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",You will find me drinking beer like a Bavarian.
386,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",You will find me drinking gin
387,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","In the lowest kind of inn,"
388,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Because I am a rigid Vegetarian.
389,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
390,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","So I cleared the inn of wine,"
391,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And I tried to climb the sign,"
392,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And I tried to hail the constable as ""Marion."""
393,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","But he said I couldn't speak,"
394,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And he bowled me to the Beak
395,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Because I was a Happy Vegetarian.
396,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
397,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Oh, I knew a Doctor Gluck,"
398,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","And his nose it had a hook,"
399,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",And his attitudes were anything but Aryan;
400,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",So I gave him all the pork
401,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","That I had, upon a fork;"
402,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Because I am myself a Vegetarian.
403,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
404,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","I am silent in the Club,"
405,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","I am silent in the pub.,"
406,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",I am silent on a bally peak in Darien;
407,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",For I stuff away for life
408,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","Shoving peas in with a knife,"
409,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Because I am at heart a Vegetarian.
410,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",
411,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",No more the milk of cows
412,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Shall pollute my private house
413,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG",Than the milk of the wild mares of the Barbarian;
414,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","I will stick to port and sherry,"
415,"WINE, WATER, AND SONG","For they are so very, very,"
