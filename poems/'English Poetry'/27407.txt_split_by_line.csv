316,THE FORCED CONSENT,But what think ye that maiden did
317,THE FORCED CONSENT,Ere mounting on her horse?
318,THE FORCED CONSENT,"A draught she drank of poison rank,"
319,THE FORCED CONSENT,Thought death her wisest course.
320,THE FORCED CONSENT,
321,THE FORCED CONSENT,"Through the shallow streams they dashed their steeds,"

340,THE FORCED CONSENT,
341,THE FORCED CONSENT,"Then they led her to the high, high hall,"
342,THE FORCED CONSENT,And in scarlet her array'd;
343,THE FORCED CONSENT,"But their joy was brief, soon came their grief,"
344,THE FORCED CONSENT,She died alack a maid!
345,THE FORCED CONSENT,
346,THE FORCED CONSENT,"Thanks be to him the youthful knight,"
347,THE FORCED CONSENT,No truer e'er was seen;
