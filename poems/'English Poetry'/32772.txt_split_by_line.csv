187,INTRODUCTION,
188,INTRODUCTION,
189,INTRODUCTION,"Once upon a time, Dan and Una, brother and sister, living in the English"
190,INTRODUCTION,"country, had the good fortune to meet with Puck, _alias_ Robin"
191,INTRODUCTION,"Goodfellow, _alias_ Nick o' Lincoln, _alias_ Lob-lie-by-the-Fire, the"
192,INTRODUCTION,last survivor in England of those whom mortals call Fairies. Their
193,INTRODUCTION,"proper name, of course, is 'The People of the Hills.' This Puck, by"
194,INTRODUCTION,"means of the magic of Oak, Ash, and Thorn, gave the children power--"
195,INTRODUCTION,
196,INTRODUCTION,"To see what they should see and hear what they should hear,"
197,INTRODUCTION,Though it should have happened three thousand year.
198,INTRODUCTION,
199,INTRODUCTION,"The result was that from time to time, and in different places on the"
200,INTRODUCTION,"farm and in the fields and the country about, they saw and talked to"
201,INTRODUCTION,"some rather interesting people. One of these, for instance, was a Knight"
202,INTRODUCTION,"of the Norman Conquest, another a young Centurion of a Roman Legion"
203,INTRODUCTION,"stationed in England, another a builder and decorator of King Henry"
204,INTRODUCTION,VII.'s time; and so on and so forth; as I have tried to explain in a
205,INTRODUCTION,book called _Puck of Pook's Hill_.
206,INTRODUCTION,
207,INTRODUCTION,"A year or so later, the children met Puck once more, and though they"
208,INTRODUCTION,"were then older and wiser, and wore boots regularly instead of going"
209,INTRODUCTION,"bare-footed when they got the chance, Puck was as kind to them as ever,"
210,INTRODUCTION,and introduced them to more people of the old days.
211,INTRODUCTION,
212,INTRODUCTION,"He was careful, of course, to take away their memory of their walks and"
213,INTRODUCTION,"conversations afterwards, but otherwise he did not interfere; and Dan"
214,INTRODUCTION,and Una would find the strangest sort of persons in their gardens or
215,INTRODUCTION,woods.
216,INTRODUCTION,
217,INTRODUCTION,In the stories that follow I am trying to tell something about those
218,INTRODUCTION,people.
219,INTRODUCTION,
220,INTRODUCTION,
221,INTRODUCTION,
222,INTRODUCTION,
223,INTRODUCTION,Cold Iron
224,INTRODUCTION,
225,INTRODUCTION,
226,INTRODUCTION,"When Dan and Una had arranged to go out before breakfast, they did not"
227,INTRODUCTION,remember it was Midsummer Morning. They only wanted to see the otter
228,INTRODUCTION,"which, old Hobden said, had been fishing their brook for weeks; and"
229,INTRODUCTION,early morning was the time to surprise him. As they tiptoed out of the
230,INTRODUCTION,"house into the wonderful stillness, the church clock struck five. Dan"
231,INTRODUCTION,"took a few steps across the dew-blobbed lawn, and looked at his black"
232,INTRODUCTION,footprints.
233,INTRODUCTION,
234,INTRODUCTION,"'I think we ought to be kind to our poor boots,' he said. 'They'll get"
235,INTRODUCTION,horrid wet.'
236,INTRODUCTION,
237,INTRODUCTION,"It was their first Summer in boots, and they hated them, so they took"
238,INTRODUCTION,"them off, and slung them round their necks, and paddled joyfully over"
239,INTRODUCTION,"the dripping turf where the shadows lay the wrong way, like evening in"
240,INTRODUCTION,the East.
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,"The sun was well up and warm, but by the brook the last of the night"
243,INTRODUCTION,mist still fumed off the water. They picked up the chain of otter's
244,INTRODUCTION,"footprints on the mud, and followed it from the bank, between the weeds"
245,INTRODUCTION,"and the drenched mowing, while the birds shouted with surprise. Then"
246,INTRODUCTION,"the track left the brook and became a smear, as though a log had been"
247,INTRODUCTION,dragged along.
248,INTRODUCTION,
249,INTRODUCTION,"They traced it into Three Cows meadow, over the mill-sluice to the"
250,INTRODUCTION,"Forge, round Hobden's garden, and then up the slope till it ran out on"
251,INTRODUCTION,"the short turf and fern of Pook's Hill, and they heard the"
252,INTRODUCTION,cock-pheasants crowing in the woods behind them.
253,INTRODUCTION,
254,INTRODUCTION,"'No use!' said Dan, questing like a puzzled hound. 'The dew's drying"
255,INTRODUCTION,"off, and old Hobden says otters'll travel for miles.'"
256,INTRODUCTION,
257,INTRODUCTION,'I'm sure we've travelled miles.' Una fanned herself with her hat. 'How
258,INTRODUCTION,still it is! It's going to be a regular roaster.' She looked down the
259,INTRODUCTION,"valley, where no chimney yet smoked."
260,INTRODUCTION,
261,INTRODUCTION,'Hobden's up!' Dan pointed to the open door of the Forge cottage. 'What
262,INTRODUCTION,d'you suppose he has for breakfast?'
263,INTRODUCTION,
264,INTRODUCTION,'One of _them_. He says they eat good all times of the year.' Una jerked
265,INTRODUCTION,her head at some stately pheasants going down to the brook for a drink.
266,INTRODUCTION,
267,INTRODUCTION,"A few steps farther on a fox broke almost under their bare feet, yapped,"
268,INTRODUCTION,and trotted off.
269,INTRODUCTION,
270,INTRODUCTION,"'Ah, Mus' Reynolds--Mus' Reynolds'--Dan was quoting from old"
271,INTRODUCTION,"Hobden,--'if I knowed all you knowed, I'd know something.'[1]"
272,INTRODUCTION,
273,INTRODUCTION,[1] See 'The Winged Hats' in _Puck of Pook's Hill_.
274,INTRODUCTION,
275,INTRODUCTION,"'I say,' Una lowered her voice, 'you know that funny feeling of things"
276,INTRODUCTION,"having happened before. I felt it when you said ""Mus' Reynolds.""'"
277,INTRODUCTION,
278,INTRODUCTION,"'So did I,' Dan began. 'What is it?'"
279,INTRODUCTION,
280,INTRODUCTION,They faced each other stammering with excitement.
281,INTRODUCTION,
282,INTRODUCTION,'Wait a shake! I'll remember in a minute. Wasn't it something about a
283,INTRODUCTION,"fox--last year. Oh, I nearly had it then!' Dan cried."
284,INTRODUCTION,
285,INTRODUCTION,"'Be quiet!' said Una, prancing excitedly. 'There was something happened"
286,INTRODUCTION,before we met the fox last year. Hills! Broken Hills--the play at the
287,INTRODUCTION,theatre--see what you see----'
288,INTRODUCTION,
289,INTRODUCTION,"'I remember now,' Dan shouted. 'It's as plain as the nose on your"
290,INTRODUCTION,face--Pook's Hill--Puck's Hill--Puck!'
291,INTRODUCTION,
292,INTRODUCTION,"'I remember, too,' said Una. 'And it's Midsummer Day again!'"
293,INTRODUCTION,
294,INTRODUCTION,"The young fern on a knoll rustled, and Puck walked out, chewing a"
295,INTRODUCTION,green-topped rush.
296,INTRODUCTION,
297,INTRODUCTION,"'Good Midsummer Morning to you. Here's a happy meeting,' said he. They"
298,INTRODUCTION,"shook hands all round, and asked questions."
299,INTRODUCTION,
300,INTRODUCTION,"'You've wintered well,' he said after a while, and looked them up and"
301,INTRODUCTION,"down. 'Nothing much wrong with you, seemingly.'"
302,INTRODUCTION,
303,INTRODUCTION,"'They've put us into boots,' said Una. 'Look at my feet--they're all"
304,INTRODUCTION,"pale white, and my toes are squdged together awfully.'"
305,INTRODUCTION,
306,INTRODUCTION,"'Yes--boots make a difference,' Puck wriggled his brown, square, hairy"
307,INTRODUCTION,"foot, and cropped a dandelion flower between the big toe and the next."
308,INTRODUCTION,
309,INTRODUCTION,"'I could do that--last year,' Dan said dismally, as he tried and failed."
310,INTRODUCTION,'And boots simply ruin one's climbing.'
311,INTRODUCTION,
312,INTRODUCTION,"'There must be some advantage to them, I suppose,' said Puck, 'or folk"
313,INTRODUCTION,wouldn't wear them. Shall we come this way?'
314,INTRODUCTION,
315,INTRODUCTION,They sauntered along side by side till they reached the gate at the far
316,INTRODUCTION,"end of the hillside. Here they halted just like cattle, and let the sun"
317,INTRODUCTION,warm their backs while they listened to the flies in the wood.
318,INTRODUCTION,
319,INTRODUCTION,"'Little Lindens is awake,' said Una, as she hung with her chin on the"
320,INTRODUCTION,top rail. 'See the chimney smoke?'
321,INTRODUCTION,
322,INTRODUCTION,"'To-day's Thursday, isn't it?' Puck turned to look at the old pink"
323,INTRODUCTION,farmhouse across the little valley. 'Mrs. Vincey's baking day. Bread
324,INTRODUCTION,"should rise well this weather.' He yawned, and that set them both"
325,INTRODUCTION,yawning.
326,INTRODUCTION,
327,INTRODUCTION,The bracken about rustled and ticked and shook in every direction. They
328,INTRODUCTION,felt that little crowds were stealing past.
329,INTRODUCTION,
330,INTRODUCTION,'Doesn't that sound like--er--the People of the Hills?' said Una.
331,INTRODUCTION,
332,INTRODUCTION,'It's the birds and wild things drawing up to the woods before people
333,INTRODUCTION,"get about,' said Puck, as though he were Ridley the keeper."
334,INTRODUCTION,
335,INTRODUCTION,"'Oh, we know that. I only said it sounded like.'"
336,INTRODUCTION,
337,INTRODUCTION,"'As I remember 'em, the People of the Hills used to make more noise."
338,INTRODUCTION,They'd settle down for the day rather like small birds settling down for
339,INTRODUCTION,"the night. But that was in the days when they carried the high hand. Oh,"
340,INTRODUCTION,"me! The deeds that I've had act and part in, you'd scarcely believe!'"
341,INTRODUCTION,
342,INTRODUCTION,"'I like that!' said Dan. 'After all you told us last year, too!'"
343,INTRODUCTION,
344,INTRODUCTION,"'Only, the minute you went away, you made us forget everything,' said"
345,INTRODUCTION,Una.
346,INTRODUCTION,
347,INTRODUCTION,"Puck laughed and shook his head. 'I shall this year, too. I've given"
348,INTRODUCTION,"you seizin of Old England, and I've taken away your Doubt and Fear, but"
349,INTRODUCTION,your memory and remembrance between whiles I'll keep where old Billy
350,INTRODUCTION,Trott kept his night-lines--and that's where he could draw 'em up and
351,INTRODUCTION,hide 'em at need. Does that suit?' He twinkled mischievously.
352,INTRODUCTION,
353,INTRODUCTION,"'It's got to suit,' said Una, and laughed. 'We can't magic back at you.'"
354,INTRODUCTION,"She folded her arms and leaned against the gate. 'Suppose, now, you"
355,INTRODUCTION,wanted to magic me into something--an otter? Could you?'
356,INTRODUCTION,
357,INTRODUCTION,'Not with those boots round your neck.'
358,INTRODUCTION,
359,INTRODUCTION,'I'll take them off.' She threw them on the turf. Dan's followed
360,INTRODUCTION,immediately. 'Now!' she said.
361,INTRODUCTION,
362,INTRODUCTION,"'Less than ever now you've trusted me. Where there's true faith, there's"
363,INTRODUCTION,no call for magic.' Puck's slow smile broadened all over his face.
364,INTRODUCTION,
365,INTRODUCTION,"'But what have boots to do with it?' said Una, perching on the gate."
366,INTRODUCTION,
367,INTRODUCTION,"'There's cold iron in them,' said Puck, and settled beside her. 'Nails"
368,INTRODUCTION,"in the soles, I mean. It makes a difference.'"
369,INTRODUCTION,
370,INTRODUCTION,'How?'
371,INTRODUCTION,
372,INTRODUCTION,'Can't you feel it does? You wouldn't like to go back to bare feet
373,INTRODUCTION,"again, same as last year, would you? Not really?'"
374,INTRODUCTION,
375,INTRODUCTION,"'No--o. I suppose I shouldn't--not for always. I'm growing up, you"
376,INTRODUCTION,"know,' said Una."
377,INTRODUCTION,
378,INTRODUCTION,"'But you told us last year, in the Long Slip--at the theatre--that you"
379,INTRODUCTION,"didn't mind Cold Iron,' said Dan."
380,INTRODUCTION,
381,INTRODUCTION,"'_I_ don't; but folk in housen, as the People of the Hills call them,"
382,INTRODUCTION,must be ruled by Cold Iron. Folk in housen are born on the near side of
383,INTRODUCTION,"Cold Iron--there's iron in every man's house, isn't there? They handle"
384,INTRODUCTION,"Cold Iron every day of their lives, and their fortune's made or spoilt"
385,INTRODUCTION,by Cold Iron in some shape or other. That's how it goes with Flesh and
386,INTRODUCTION,"Blood, and one can't prevent it.'"
387,INTRODUCTION,
388,INTRODUCTION,'I don't quite see. How do you mean?' said Dan.
389,INTRODUCTION,
390,INTRODUCTION,'It would take me some time to tell you.'
391,INTRODUCTION,
392,INTRODUCTION,"'Oh, it's ever so long to breakfast,' said Dan. 'We looked in the larder"
393,INTRODUCTION,before we came out.' He unpocketed one big hunk of bread and Una
394,INTRODUCTION,"another, which they shared with Puck."
395,INTRODUCTION,
396,INTRODUCTION,"'That's Little Lindens' baking,' he said, as his white teeth sunk in it."
397,INTRODUCTION,'I know Mrs. Vincey's hand.' He ate with a slow sideways thrust and
398,INTRODUCTION,"grind, just like old Hobden, and, like Hobden, hardly dropped a crumb."
399,INTRODUCTION,"The sun flashed on Little Lindens' windows, and the cloudless sky grew"
400,INTRODUCTION,stiller and hotter in the valley.
401,INTRODUCTION,
402,INTRODUCTION,"'Ah--Cold Iron,' he said at last to the impatient children. 'Folk in"
403,INTRODUCTION,"housen, as the People of the Hills say, grow so careless about Cold"

407,INTRODUCTION,
408,INTRODUCTION,"'Oh, I know. Steal it and leave a changeling,' Una cried."
409,INTRODUCTION,
410,INTRODUCTION,"'No,' said Puck firmly. 'All that talk of changelings is people's excuse"
411,INTRODUCTION,for their own neglect. Never believe 'em. I'd whip 'em at the cart-tail
412,INTRODUCTION,through three parishes if I had my way.'
413,INTRODUCTION,
414,INTRODUCTION,"'But they don't do it now,' said Una."
415,INTRODUCTION,
416,INTRODUCTION,"'Whip, or neglect children? Umm! Some folks and some fields never alter."
417,INTRODUCTION,But the People of the Hills didn't work any changeling tricks. They'd
418,INTRODUCTION,"tiptoe in and whisper, and weave round the cradle-babe in the"
419,INTRODUCTION,"chimney-corner--a fag-end of a charm here, or half a spell there--like"
420,INTRODUCTION,"kettles singing; but when the babe's mind came to bud out afterwards, it"
421,INTRODUCTION,would act differently from other people in its station. That's no
422,INTRODUCTION,advantage to man or maid. So I wouldn't allow it with my folks' babies
423,INTRODUCTION,here. I told Sir Huon so once.'
424,INTRODUCTION,
425,INTRODUCTION,"'Who was Sir Huon?' Dan asked, and Puck turned on him in quiet"
426,INTRODUCTION,astonishment.
427,INTRODUCTION,
428,INTRODUCTION,'Sir Huon of Bordeaux--he succeeded King Oberon. He had been a bold
429,INTRODUCTION,"knight once, but he was lost on the road to Babylon, a long while back."
430,INTRODUCTION,"Have you ever heard, ""How many miles to Babylon?""'"
431,INTRODUCTION,
432,INTRODUCTION,"'Of course,' said Dan, flushing."
433,INTRODUCTION,
434,INTRODUCTION,"'Well, Sir Huon was young when that song was new. But about tricks on"
435,INTRODUCTION,"mortal babies. I said to Sir Huon in the fern here, on just such a"
436,INTRODUCTION,"morning as this: ""If you crave to act and influence on folk in housen,"
437,INTRODUCTION,"which I know is your desire, why don't you take some human cradle-babe"
438,INTRODUCTION,"by fair dealing, and bring him up among yourselves on the far side of"
439,INTRODUCTION,Cold Iron--as Oberon did in time past? Then you could make him a
440,INTRODUCTION,"splendid fortune, and send him out into the world?"""
441,INTRODUCTION,
442,INTRODUCTION,"'""Time past is past time,"" says Sir Huon. ""I doubt if we could do it."
443,INTRODUCTION,"For one thing, the babe would have to be taken without wronging man,"
444,INTRODUCTION,"woman, or child. For another, he'd have to be born on the far side of"
445,INTRODUCTION,Cold Iron--in some house where no Cold Iron ever stood; and for yet the
446,INTRODUCTION,"third, he'd have to be kept from Cold Iron all his days till we let him"
447,INTRODUCTION,"find his fortune. No, it's not easy,"" he said, and he rode off,"
448,INTRODUCTION,"thinking. You see, Sir Huon had been a man once."
449,INTRODUCTION,
450,INTRODUCTION,"'I happened to attend Lewes Market next Woden's Day even, and watched"
451,INTRODUCTION,the slaves being sold there--same as pigs are sold at Robertsbridge
452,INTRODUCTION,"Market nowadays. Only, the pigs have rings on their noses, and the"
453,INTRODUCTION,slaves had rings round their necks.'
454,INTRODUCTION,
455,INTRODUCTION,'What sort of rings?' said Dan.
456,INTRODUCTION,
457,INTRODUCTION,"'A ring of Cold Iron, four fingers wide, and a thumb thick, just like a"
458,INTRODUCTION,"quoit, but with a snap to it for to snap round the slave's neck. They"
459,INTRODUCTION,"used to do a big trade in slave-rings at the Forge here, and ship them"
460,INTRODUCTION,"to all parts of Old England, packed in oak sawdust. But, as I was"
461,INTRODUCTION,"saying, there was a farmer out of the Weald who had bought a woman with"
462,INTRODUCTION,"a babe in her arms, and he didn't want any encumbrances to her driving"
463,INTRODUCTION,his beasts home for him.'
464,INTRODUCTION,
465,INTRODUCTION,"'Beast himself!' said Una, and kicked her bare heel on the gate."
466,INTRODUCTION,
467,INTRODUCTION,"'So he blamed the auctioneer. ""It's none o' my baby,"" the wench puts in."

475,INTRODUCTION,"should have been surprised if he could! Then I whipped up the babe, and"

477,INTRODUCTION,
478,INTRODUCTION,'On the dewy break of morning of Thor's own day--just such a day as

501,INTRODUCTION,
502,INTRODUCTION,'Who was his Lady?' said Dan.
503,INTRODUCTION,
504,INTRODUCTION,"'The Lady Esclairmonde. She had been a woman once, till she followed"
505,INTRODUCTION,"Sir Huon across the fern, as we say. Babies are no special treat to"
506,INTRODUCTION,me--I've watched too many of them--so I stayed on the Hill. Presently I
507,INTRODUCTION,"heard hammering down at the Forge there,' Puck pointed towards Hobden's"
508,INTRODUCTION,"cottage. 'It was too early for any workmen, but it passed through my"
509,INTRODUCTION,mind that the breaking day was Thor's own day. A slow North-East wind
510,INTRODUCTION,blew up and set the oaks sawing and fretting in a way I remembered; so I
511,INTRODUCTION,slipped over to see what I could see.'
512,INTRODUCTION,
513,INTRODUCTION,'And what did you see?'
514,INTRODUCTION,
515,INTRODUCTION,'A smith forging something or other out of Cold Iron. When it was
516,INTRODUCTION,"finished, he weighed it in his hand (his back was towards me), and"
517,INTRODUCTION,tossed it from him a longish quoit-throw down the valley. I saw Cold
518,INTRODUCTION,"Iron flash in the sun, but I couldn't quite make out where it fell."
519,INTRODUCTION,_That_ didn't trouble me. I knew it would be found sooner or later by
520,INTRODUCTION,some one.'
521,INTRODUCTION,
522,INTRODUCTION,'How did you know?' Dan went on.
523,INTRODUCTION,
524,INTRODUCTION,"'Because I knew the Smith that made it,' said Puck quietly."
525,INTRODUCTION,
526,INTRODUCTION,'Wayland Smith?'[2] Una suggested.
527,INTRODUCTION,
528,INTRODUCTION,[2] See 'Weland's Sword' in _Puck of Pook's Hill_.
529,INTRODUCTION,
530,INTRODUCTION,"'No. I should have passed the time o' day with Wayland Smith, of course."
531,INTRODUCTION,This other was different. So'--Puck made a queer crescent in the air
532,INTRODUCTION,with his finger--'I counted the blades of grass under my nose till the
533,INTRODUCTION,wind dropped and he had gone--he and his Hammer.'
534,INTRODUCTION,
535,INTRODUCTION,'Was it Thor then?' Una murmured under her breath.
536,INTRODUCTION,
537,INTRODUCTION,'Who else? It was Thor's own day.' Puck repeated the sign. 'I didn't
538,INTRODUCTION,tell Sir Huon or his Lady what I'd seen. Borrow trouble for yourself if
539,INTRODUCTION,"that's your nature, but don't lend it to your neighbours. Moreover, I"
540,INTRODUCTION,might have been mistaken about the Smith's work. He might have been
541,INTRODUCTION,"making things for mere amusement, though it wasn't like him, or he might"
542,INTRODUCTION,have thrown away an old piece of made iron. One can never be sure. So I
543,INTRODUCTION,held my tongue and enjoyed the babe. He was a wonderful child--and the
544,INTRODUCTION,"People of the Hills were so set on him, they wouldn't have believed me."
545,INTRODUCTION,He took to me wonderfully. As soon as he could walk he'd putter forth
546,INTRODUCTION,with me all about my Hill here. Fern makes soft falling! He knew when
547,INTRODUCTION,"day broke on earth above, for he'd thump, thump, thump, like an old"
548,INTRODUCTION,"buck-rabbit in a bury, and I'd hear him say ""Opy!"" till some one who"
549,INTRODUCTION,"knew the Charm let him out, and then it would be ""Robin! Robin!"" all"
550,INTRODUCTION,"round Robin Hood's barn, as we say, till he'd found me.'"
551,INTRODUCTION,
552,INTRODUCTION,'The dear!' said Una. 'I'd like to have seen him!'
553,INTRODUCTION,
554,INTRODUCTION,"'Yes, he was a boy. And when it came to learning his words--spells and"
555,INTRODUCTION,"such like--he'd sit on the Hill in the long shadows, worrying out bits"
556,INTRODUCTION,"of charms to try on passers-by. And when the bird flew to him, or the"
557,INTRODUCTION,tree bowed to him for pure love's sake (like everything else on my
558,INTRODUCTION,"Hill), he'd shout, ""Robin! Look--see! Look, see, Robin!"" and sputter out"
559,INTRODUCTION,"some spell or other that they had taught him, _all_ wrong end first,"
560,INTRODUCTION,till I hadn't the heart to tell him it was his own dear self and not
561,INTRODUCTION,"the words that worked the wonder. When he got more abreast of his words,"
562,INTRODUCTION,"and could cast spells for sure, as we say, he took more and more notice"
563,INTRODUCTION,"of things and people in the world. People, of course, always drew him,"
564,INTRODUCTION,for he was mortal all through.
565,INTRODUCTION,
566,INTRODUCTION,"'Seeing that he was free to move among folk in housen, under or over"
567,INTRODUCTION,"Cold Iron, I used to take him along with me night-walking, where he"
568,INTRODUCTION,"could watch folk, and I could keep him from touching Cold Iron. That"
569,INTRODUCTION,"wasn't so difficult as it sounds, because there are plenty of things"
570,INTRODUCTION,"besides Cold Iron in housen to catch a boy's fancy. He _was_ a handful,"
571,INTRODUCTION,though! I shan't forget when I took him to Little Lindens--his first
572,INTRODUCTION,night under a roof. The smell of the rushlights and the bacon on the
573,INTRODUCTION,"beams--they were stuffing a feather-bed too, and it was a drizzling warm"
574,INTRODUCTION,night--got into his head. Before I could stop him--we were hiding in the
575,INTRODUCTION,"bakehouse--he'd whipped up a storm of wildfire, with flashlights and"
576,INTRODUCTION,"voices, which sent the folk shrieking into the garden, and a girl"
577,INTRODUCTION,"overset a hive there, and--of course _he_ didn't know till then such"
578,INTRODUCTION,"things could touch him--he got badly stung, and came home with his face"
579,INTRODUCTION,looking like kidney potatoes!
580,INTRODUCTION,
581,INTRODUCTION,'You can imagine how angry Sir Huon and Lady Esclairmonde were with poor
582,INTRODUCTION,Robin! They said the Boy was never to be trusted with me night-walking
583,INTRODUCTION,any more--and he took about as much notice of their order as he did of
584,INTRODUCTION,"the bee-stings. Night after night, as soon as it was dark, I'd pick up"
585,INTRODUCTION,"his whistle in the wet fern, and off we'd flit together among folk in"
586,INTRODUCTION,"housen till break of day--he asking questions, and I answering"
587,INTRODUCTION,according to my knowledge. Then we fell into mischief again!' Puck shook
588,INTRODUCTION,till the gate rattled.
589,INTRODUCTION,
590,INTRODUCTION,'We came across a man up at Brightling who was beating his wife with a
591,INTRODUCTION,bat in the garden. I was just going to toss the man over his own
592,INTRODUCTION,woodlump when the Boy jumped the hedge and ran at him. Of course the
593,INTRODUCTION,"woman took her husband's part, and while the man beat him, the woman"
594,INTRODUCTION,scratted his face. It wasn't till I danced among the cabbages like
595,INTRODUCTION,Brightling Beacon all ablaze that they gave up and ran indoors. The
596,INTRODUCTION,"Boy's fine green-and-gold clothes were torn all to pieces, and he had"
597,INTRODUCTION,"been welted in twenty places with the man's bat, and scratted by the"
598,INTRODUCTION,woman's nails to pieces. He looked like a Robertsbridge hopper on a
599,INTRODUCTION,Monday morning.
600,INTRODUCTION,
601,INTRODUCTION,"'""Robin,"" said he, while I was trying to clean him down with a bunch of"
602,INTRODUCTION,"hay, ""I don't quite understand folk in housen. I went to help that old"

604,INTRODUCTION,
605,INTRODUCTION,"'""What else did you expect?"" I said. ""That was the one time when you"

608,INTRODUCTION,
609,INTRODUCTION,"'""I didn't think,"" he says. ""But I caught the man one on the head that"
610,INTRODUCTION,"was as good as any charm. Did you see it work, Robin?"""
611,INTRODUCTION,
612,INTRODUCTION,"'""Mind your nose,"" I said. ""Bleed it on a dockleaf--not your sleeve, for"
613,INTRODUCTION,"pity's sake."" I knew what the Lady Esclairmonde would say."
614,INTRODUCTION,
615,INTRODUCTION,"'_He_ didn't care. He was as happy as a gipsy with a stolen pony, and"
616,INTRODUCTION,"the front part of his gold coat, all blood and grass stains, looked like"
617,INTRODUCTION,ancient sacrifices.
618,INTRODUCTION,
619,INTRODUCTION,'Of course the People of the Hills laid the blame on me. The Boy could
620,INTRODUCTION,"do nothing wrong, in their eyes."
621,INTRODUCTION,
622,INTRODUCTION,"'""You are bringing him up to act and influence on folk in housen, when"
623,INTRODUCTION,"you're ready to let him go,"" I said. ""Now he's begun to do it, why do"

625,INTRODUCTION,"kind."""
626,INTRODUCTION,
627,INTRODUCTION,"'""But we don't want him to begin _that_ way,"" the Lady Esclairmonde"
628,INTRODUCTION,"said. ""We intend a splendid fortune for him--not your flitter-by-night,"
629,INTRODUCTION,"hedge-jumping, gipsy-work."""
630,INTRODUCTION,
631,INTRODUCTION,"'""I don't blame you, Robin,"" says Sir Huon, ""but I _do_ think you might"
632,INTRODUCTION,"look after the Boy more closely."""
633,INTRODUCTION,
634,INTRODUCTION,"'""I've kept him away from Cold Iron these sixteen years,"" I said. ""You"
635,INTRODUCTION,"know as well as I do, the first time he touches Cold Iron he'll find his"

637,INTRODUCTION,"something for that."""
638,INTRODUCTION,
639,INTRODUCTION,"'Sir Huon, having been a man, was going to allow me the right of it, but"
640,INTRODUCTION,"the Lady Esclairmonde, being the Mother of all Mothers, over-persuaded"

643,INTRODUCTION,"'""We're very grateful,"" Sir Huon said, ""but we think that just for the"

645,INTRODUCTION,
646,INTRODUCTION,"'""Though you have said it,"" I said, ""I will give you a second chance."" I"
647,INTRODUCTION,did not like being called to account for my doings on my own Hill. I

651,INTRODUCTION,"left to me and himself. It's your fault."""
652,INTRODUCTION,
653,INTRODUCTION,"'""You have said it,"" I answered. ""Hear me! From now on till the Boy has"
654,INTRODUCTION,"found his fortune, whatever that may be, I vow to you all on my Hill, by"
655,INTRODUCTION,"Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, _and_ by the Hammer of Asa Thor""'--again Puck"
656,INTRODUCTION,"made that curious double-cut in the air--'""that you may leave me out of"
657,INTRODUCTION,"all your counts and reckonings."" Then I went out'--he snapped his"
658,INTRODUCTION,"fingers--'like the puff of a candle, and though they called and cried,"
659,INTRODUCTION,"they made nothing by it. I didn't promise not to keep an eye on the Boy,"
660,INTRODUCTION,though. I watched him close--close--close!
661,INTRODUCTION,
662,INTRODUCTION,"'When he found what his people had forced me to do, he gave them a piece"
663,INTRODUCTION,"of his mind, but they all kissed and cried round him, and being only a"
664,INTRODUCTION,"boy, he came over to their way of thinking (I don't blame him), and"
665,INTRODUCTION,called himself unkind and ungrateful; and it all ended in fresh shows
666,INTRODUCTION,"and plays, and magics to distract him from folk in housen. Dear heart"
667,INTRODUCTION,"alive! How he used to call and call on me, and I couldn't answer, or"
668,INTRODUCTION,even let him know that I was near!'
669,INTRODUCTION,
670,INTRODUCTION,'Not even once?' said Una. 'If he was very lonely?'
671,INTRODUCTION,
672,INTRODUCTION,"'No, he couldn't,' said Dan, who had been thinking. 'Didn't you swear by"
673,INTRODUCTION,"the Hammer of Thor that you wouldn't, Puck?'"
674,INTRODUCTION,
675,INTRODUCTION,'By that Hammer!' was the deep rumbled reply. Then he came back to his
676,INTRODUCTION,"soft speaking voice. 'And the Boy _was_ lonely, when he couldn't see me"
677,INTRODUCTION,"any more. He began to try to learn all learning (he had good teachers),"
678,INTRODUCTION,but I saw him lift his eyes from the big black books towards folk in
679,INTRODUCTION,"housen all the time. He studied song-making (good teacher she had too!),"
680,INTRODUCTION,"but he sung those songs with his back toward the Hill, and his face"
681,INTRODUCTION,toward folk. _I_ know! I have sat and grieved over him grieving within a
682,INTRODUCTION,"rabbit's jump of him. Then he studied the High, Low, and Middle Magic."
683,INTRODUCTION,He had promised the Lady Esclairmonde he would never go near folk in
684,INTRODUCTION,housen; so he had to make shows and shadows for his mind to chew on.'
685,INTRODUCTION,
686,INTRODUCTION,'What sort of shows?' said Dan.
687,INTRODUCTION,
688,INTRODUCTION,"'Just boy's magic as we say. I'll show you some, some time. It pleased"
689,INTRODUCTION,"him for the while, and it didn't hurt any one in particular except a few"
690,INTRODUCTION,"men coming home late from the taverns. But I knew what it was a sign of,"
691,INTRODUCTION,and I followed him like a weasel follows a rabbit. As good a boy as ever
692,INTRODUCTION,lived! I've seen him with Sir Huon and the Lady Esclairmonde stepping
693,INTRODUCTION,"just as they stepped to avoid the track of Cold Iron in a furrow, or"
694,INTRODUCTION,walking wide of some old ash-tot because a man had left his swop-hook or
695,INTRODUCTION,spade there; and all his heart aching to go straightforward among folk
696,INTRODUCTION,"in housen all the time. Oh, a good boy! They always intended a fine"
697,INTRODUCTION,fortune for him--but they could never find it in their heart to let him
698,INTRODUCTION,"begin. I've heard that many warned them, but they wouldn't be warned."
699,INTRODUCTION,So it happened _as_ it happened.
700,INTRODUCTION,
701,INTRODUCTION,'One hot night I saw the Boy roving about here wrapped in his flaming
702,INTRODUCTION,"discontents. There was flash on flash against the clouds, and rush on"
703,INTRODUCTION,rush of shadows down the valley till the shaws were full of his hounds
704,INTRODUCTION,"giving tongue, and the wood-ways were packed with his knights in armour"
705,INTRODUCTION,"riding down into the water-mists--all his own magic, of course. Behind"
706,INTRODUCTION,them you could see great castles lifting slow and splendid on arches of
707,INTRODUCTION,"moonshine, with maidens waving their hands at the windows, which all"
708,INTRODUCTION,turned into roaring rivers; and then would come the darkness of his own
709,INTRODUCTION,young heart wiping out the whole slateful. But boy's magic doesn't
710,INTRODUCTION,trouble me--or Merlin's either for that matter. I followed the Boy by
711,INTRODUCTION,"the flashes and the whirling wildfire of his discontent, and oh, but I"
712,INTRODUCTION,"grieved for him! Oh, but I grieved for him! He pounded back and forth"
713,INTRODUCTION,like a bullock in a strange pasture--sometimes alone--sometimes
714,INTRODUCTION,waist-deep among his shadow-hounds--sometimes leading his shadow-knights
715,INTRODUCTION,on a hawk-winged horse to rescue his shadow-girls. I never guessed he
716,INTRODUCTION,had such magic at his command; but it's often that way with boys.
717,INTRODUCTION,
718,INTRODUCTION,"'Just when the owl comes home for the second time, I saw Sir Huon and"
719,INTRODUCTION,"the Lady ride down my Hill, where there's not much magic allowed except"
720,INTRODUCTION,mine. They were very pleased at the Boy's magic--the valley flared with
721,INTRODUCTION,it--and I heard them settling his splendid fortune when they should find
722,INTRODUCTION,it in their hearts to let him go to act and influence among folk in
723,INTRODUCTION,"housen. Sir Huon was for making him a great King somewhere or other, and"
724,INTRODUCTION,the Lady was for making him a marvellous wise man whom all should praise
725,INTRODUCTION,for his skill and kindness. She was very kind-hearted.
726,INTRODUCTION,
727,INTRODUCTION,'Of a sudden we saw the flashes of his discontent turned back on the
728,INTRODUCTION,"clouds, and his shadow-hounds stopped baying."

741,INTRODUCTION,fell. We heard the Boy walking in the Long Slip--where I first met you.
742,INTRODUCTION,
743,INTRODUCTION,"'""Here, oh, come here!"" said the Lady Esclairmonde, and stretched out"

958,THE TWO COUSINS,Scarce had they lifted up
959,THE TWO COUSINS,"Life's full and fiery cup,"
960,THE TWO COUSINS,Than they had set it down untouched before them.
961,THE TWO COUSINS,Before their day arose
962,THE TWO COUSINS,They beckoned it to close--

979,THE TWO COUSINS,"Indian wigwams, had been given to Dan and Una for their very own kingdom"
980,THE TWO COUSINS,"when they were quite small. As they grew older, they contrived to keep"
981,THE TWO COUSINS,"it most particularly private. Even Phillips, the gardener, told them"
982,THE TWO COUSINS,"every time he came in to take a hop-pole for his beans, and old Hobden"

989,THE TWO COUSINS,"as they were going up for a potato-roast, they saw somebody moving among"

991,THE TWO COUSINS,"potatoes, and while they were picking them up Puck came out of a wigwam."
992,THE TWO COUSINS,
993,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Oh, it's you, is it?' said Una. 'We thought it was people.'"
994,THE TWO COUSINS,
995,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I saw you were angry--from your legs,' he answered with a grin."

997,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Well, it's our own Kingdom--not counting you, of course.'"

1001,THE TWO COUSINS,'What about?' said Dan cautiously.
1002,THE TWO COUSINS,
1003,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Oh, just Kingdoms and things. She knows about Kingdoms.'"
1004,THE TWO COUSINS,
1005,THE TWO COUSINS,There was a lady near the fence dressed in a long dark cloak that hid
1006,THE TWO COUSINS,everything except her high red-heeled shoes. Her face was half covered
1007,THE TWO COUSINS,"by a black silk fringed mask, without goggles. And yet she did not look"
1008,THE TWO COUSINS,in the least as if she motored.
1009,THE TWO COUSINS,
1010,THE TWO COUSINS,Puck led them up to her and bowed solemnly. Una made the best
1011,THE TWO COUSINS,"dancing-lesson curtsy she could remember. The lady answered with a long,"
1012,THE TWO COUSINS,"deep, slow, billowy one."
1013,THE TWO COUSINS,
1014,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Since it seems that you are a Queen of this Kingdom,' she said, 'I can"
1015,THE TWO COUSINS,do no less than acknowledge your sovereignty.' She turned sharply on
1016,THE TWO COUSINS,"staring Dan. 'What's in your head, lad? Manners?'"
1017,THE TWO COUSINS,
1018,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I was thinking how wonderfully you did that curtsy,' he answered."
1019,THE TWO COUSINS,
1020,THE TWO COUSINS,She laughed a rather shrill laugh. 'You're a courtier already. Do you
1021,THE TWO COUSINS,"know anything of dances, wench--or Queen, must I say?'"
1022,THE TWO COUSINS,
1023,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I've had some lessons, but I can't really dance a bit,' said Una."
1024,THE TWO COUSINS,
1025,THE TWO COUSINS,'You should learn then.' The lady moved forward as though she would
1026,THE TWO COUSINS,teach her at once. 'It gives a woman alone among men or her enemies
1027,THE TWO COUSINS,time to think how she shall win or--lose. A woman can only work in man's
1028,THE TWO COUSINS,playtime. Heigho!' She sat down on the bank.
1029,THE TWO COUSINS,
1030,THE TWO COUSINS,"Old Middenboro, the lawn-mower pony, stumped across the paddock and hung"
1031,THE TWO COUSINS,his sorrowful head over the fence.
1032,THE TWO COUSINS,
1033,THE TWO COUSINS,"'A pleasant Kingdom,' said the lady, looking round. 'Well enclosed. And"
1034,THE TWO COUSINS,how does your Majesty govern it? Who is your Minister?'
1035,THE TWO COUSINS,
1036,THE TWO COUSINS,"Una did not quite understand. 'We don't play that,' she said."
1037,THE TWO COUSINS,
1038,THE TWO COUSINS,'Play?' The lady threw up her hands and laughed.
1039,THE TWO COUSINS,
1040,THE TWO COUSINS,"'We have it for our own, together,' Dan explained."
1041,THE TWO COUSINS,
1042,THE TWO COUSINS,"'And d'you never quarrel, young Burleigh?'"
1043,THE TWO COUSINS,
1044,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Sometimes, but then we don't tell.'"
1045,THE TWO COUSINS,
1046,THE TWO COUSINS,"The lady nodded. 'I've no brats of my own, but I understand keeping a"
1047,THE TWO COUSINS,secret between Queens and their Ministers. _Ay de mi!_ But with no
1048,THE TWO COUSINS,"disrespect to present majesty, methinks your realm is small, and"
1049,THE TWO COUSINS,therefore likely to be coveted by man and beast. For example'--she
1050,THE TWO COUSINS,"pointed to Middenboro--'yonder old horse, with the face of a Spanish"
1051,THE TWO COUSINS,friar--does he never break in?'
1052,THE TWO COUSINS,
1053,THE TWO COUSINS,"'He can't. Old Hobden stops all our gaps for us,' said Una, 'and we let"
1054,THE TWO COUSINS,Hobden catch rabbits in the Shaw.'
1055,THE TWO COUSINS,
1056,THE TWO COUSINS,The lady laughed like a man. 'I see! Hobden catches conies--rabbits--for
1057,THE TWO COUSINS,"himself, and guards your defences for you. Does he make a profit out of"
1058,THE TWO COUSINS,his coney-catching?'
1059,THE TWO COUSINS,
1060,THE TWO COUSINS,"'We never ask,' said Una. 'Hobden's a particular friend of ours.'"
1061,THE TWO COUSINS,
1062,THE TWO COUSINS,'Hoity-toity!' the lady began angrily. Then she laughed. 'But I forget.
1063,THE TWO COUSINS,It is your Kingdom. I knew a maid once that had a larger one than this
1064,THE TWO COUSINS,"to defend, and so long as her men kept the fences stopped, she asked 'em"
1065,THE TWO COUSINS,no questions either.'
1066,THE TWO COUSINS,
1067,THE TWO COUSINS,'Was she trying to grow flowers?' said Una.
1068,THE TWO COUSINS,
1069,THE TWO COUSINS,"'No, trees--perdurable trees. Her flowers all withered.' The lady leaned"
1070,THE TWO COUSINS,her head on her hand.
1071,THE TWO COUSINS,
1072,THE TWO COUSINS,'They do if you don't look after them. We've got a few. Would you like
1073,THE TWO COUSINS,to see? I'll fetch you some.' Una ran off to the rank grass in the shade
1074,THE TWO COUSINS,"behind the wigwam, and came back with a handful of red flowers. 'Aren't"
1075,THE TWO COUSINS,they pretty?' she said. 'They're Virginia stock.'
1076,THE TWO COUSINS,
1077,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Virginia?' said the lady, and lifted them to the fringe of her mask."
1078,THE TWO COUSINS,
1079,THE TWO COUSINS,'Yes. They come from Virginia. Did your maid ever plant any?'
1080,THE TWO COUSINS,
1081,THE TWO COUSINS,'Not herself--but her men adventured all over the earth to pluck or to
1082,THE TWO COUSINS,plant flowers for her crown. They judged her worthy of them.'
1083,THE TWO COUSINS,
1084,THE TWO COUSINS,'And was she?' said Dan cheerfully.
1085,THE TWO COUSINS,
1086,THE TWO COUSINS,"'_Quien sabe?_ (who knows?) But at least, while her men toiled abroad"
1087,THE TWO COUSINS,"she toiled in England, that they might find a safe home to come back"
1088,THE TWO COUSINS,to.'
1089,THE TWO COUSINS,
1090,THE TWO COUSINS,'And what was she called?'
1091,THE TWO COUSINS,
1092,THE TWO COUSINS,'Gloriana--Belphoebe--Elizabeth of England.' Her voice changed at each
1093,THE TWO COUSINS,word.
1094,THE TWO COUSINS,
1095,THE TWO COUSINS,'You mean Queen Bess?' The lady bowed her head a little towards Dan.
1096,THE TWO COUSINS,
1097,THE TWO COUSINS,"'You name her lightly enough, young Burleigh. What might you know of"
1098,THE TWO COUSINS,her?' said she.
1099,THE TWO COUSINS,
1100,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Well, I--I've seen the little green shoes she left at Brickwall"
1101,THE TWO COUSINS,"House--down the road, you know. They're in a glass case--awfully tiny"
1102,THE TWO COUSINS,things.'
1103,THE TWO COUSINS,
1104,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Oh, Burleigh, Burleigh!' she laughed. 'You are a courtier too soon.'"
1105,THE TWO COUSINS,
1106,THE TWO COUSINS,"'But they are,' Dan insisted. 'As little as dolls' shoes. Did you really"
1107,THE TWO COUSINS,know her well?'
1108,THE TWO COUSINS,
1109,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Well. She was a--woman. I've been at her Court all my life. Yes, I"
1110,THE TWO COUSINS,remember when she danced after the banquet at Brickwall. They say she
1111,THE TWO COUSINS,danced Philip of Spain out of a brand-new kingdom that day. Worth the
1112,THE TWO COUSINS,price of a pair of old shoes--hey?'
1113,THE TWO COUSINS,
1114,THE TWO COUSINS,"She thrust out one foot, and stooped forward to look at its broad"
1115,THE TWO COUSINS,flashing buckle.
1116,THE TWO COUSINS,
1117,THE TWO COUSINS,"'You've heard of Philip of Spain--long-suffering Philip,' she said, her"
1118,THE TWO COUSINS,"eyes still on the shining stones. 'Faith, what some men will endure at"
1119,THE TWO COUSINS,"some women's hands passes belief! If _I_ had been a man, and a woman had"
1120,THE TWO COUSINS,"played with me as Elizabeth played with Philip, I would have----' She"
1121,THE TWO COUSINS,nipped off one of the Virginia stocks and held it up between finger and
1122,THE TWO COUSINS,thumb. 'But for all that'--she began to strip the leaves one by
1123,THE TWO COUSINS,one--'they say--and I am persuaded--that Philip loved her.' She tossed
1124,THE TWO COUSINS,her head sideways.
1125,THE TWO COUSINS,
1126,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I don't quite understand,' said Una."
1127,THE TWO COUSINS,
1128,THE TWO COUSINS,"'The high heavens forbid that you should, wench!' She swept the flowers"
1129,THE TWO COUSINS,from her lap and stood up in the rush of shadows that the wind chased
1130,THE TWO COUSINS,through the wood.
1131,THE TWO COUSINS,
1132,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I should like to know about the shoes,' said Dan."
1133,THE TWO COUSINS,
1134,THE TWO COUSINS,"'So ye shall, Burleigh. So ye shall, if ye watch me. 'Twill be as good"
1135,THE TWO COUSINS,as a play.'
1136,THE TWO COUSINS,
1137,THE TWO COUSINS,"'We've never been to a play,' said Una."
1138,THE TWO COUSINS,
1139,THE TWO COUSINS,The lady looked at her and laughed. 'I'll make one for you. Watch! You
1140,THE TWO COUSINS,"are to imagine that she--Gloriana, Belphoebe, Elizabeth--has gone on a"
1141,THE TWO COUSINS,"progress to Rye to comfort her sad heart (maids are often melancholic),"
1142,THE TWO COUSINS,"and while she halts at Brickwall House, the village--what was its name?'"
1143,THE TWO COUSINS,She pushed Puck with her foot.
1144,THE TWO COUSINS,
1145,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Norgem,' he croaked, and squatted by the wigwam."
1146,THE TWO COUSINS,
1147,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Norgem village loyally entertains her with a masque or play, and a"
1148,THE TWO COUSINS,"Latin oration spoken by the parson, for whose false quantities, if I'd"
1149,THE TWO COUSINS,"made 'em in my girlhood, I should have been whipped.'"
1150,THE TWO COUSINS,
1151,THE TWO COUSINS,'You whipped?' said Dan.
1152,THE TWO COUSINS,
1153,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Soundly, sirrah, soundly! She stomachs the affront to her scholarship,"
1154,THE TWO COUSINS,"makes her grateful, gracious thanks from the teeth outwards, thus'--(the"
1155,THE TWO COUSINS,"lady yawned)--'Oh, a Queen may love her subjects in her heart, and yet"
1156,THE TWO COUSINS,be dog-wearied of 'em in body and mind--and so sits down'--her skirts
1157,THE TWO COUSINS,foamed about her as she sat--'to a banquet beneath Brickwall Oak. Here
1158,THE TWO COUSINS,for her sins she is waited upon by---- What were the young cockerels'
1159,THE TWO COUSINS,names that served Gloriana at table?'
1160,THE TWO COUSINS,
1161,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Frewens, Courthopes, Fullers, Husseys,' Puck began."
1162,THE TWO COUSINS,
1163,THE TWO COUSINS,She held up her long jewelled hand. 'Spare the rest! They were the best
1164,THE TWO COUSINS,"blood of Sussex, and by so much the more clumsy in handling the dishes"
1165,THE TWO COUSINS,and plates. Wherefore'--she looked funnily over her shoulder--'you are
1166,THE TWO COUSINS,"to think of Gloriana in a green and gold-laced habit, dreadfully"
1167,THE TWO COUSINS,"expecting that the jostling youths behind her would, of pure jealousy or"
1168,THE TWO COUSINS,"devotion, spatter it with sauces and wines. The gown was Philip's gift,"
1169,THE TWO COUSINS,"too! At this happy juncture a Queen's messenger, mounted and mired,"
1170,THE TWO COUSINS,spurs up the Rye road and delivers her a letter'--she giggled--'a letter
1171,THE TWO COUSINS,"from a good, simple, frantic Spanish gentleman called--Don Philip.'"
1172,THE TWO COUSINS,
1173,THE TWO COUSINS,"'That wasn't Philip, King of Spain?' Dan asked."
1174,THE TWO COUSINS,
1175,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Truly, it was. 'Twixt you and me and the bedpost, young Burleigh, these"
1176,THE TWO COUSINS,"kings and queens are very like men and women, and I've heard they write"
1177,THE TWO COUSINS,"each other fond, foolish letters that none of their ministers should"
1178,THE TWO COUSINS,open.'
1179,THE TWO COUSINS,
1180,THE TWO COUSINS,'Did her ministers ever open Queen Elizabeth's letters?' said Una.
1181,THE TWO COUSINS,
1182,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Faith, yes! But she'd have done as much for theirs, any day. You are to"
1183,THE TWO COUSINS,"think of Gloriana, then (they say she had a pretty hand), excusing"
1184,THE TWO COUSINS,"herself thus to the company--for the Queen's time is never her own--and,"
1185,THE TWO COUSINS,"while the music strikes up, reading Philip's letter, as I do.' She drew"
1186,THE TWO COUSINS,"a real letter from her pocket, and held it out almost at arm's length,"
1187,THE TWO COUSINS,like the old post-mistress in the village when she reads telegrams.
1188,THE TWO COUSINS,
1189,THE TWO COUSINS,'_Hm! Hm! Hm!_ Philip writes as ever most lovingly. He says his Gloriana
1190,THE TWO COUSINS,"is cold, for which reason he burns for her through a fair written"
1191,THE TWO COUSINS,page.' She turned it with a snap. 'What's here? Philip complains that
1192,THE TWO COUSINS,certain of her gentlemen have fought against his generals in the Low
1193,THE TWO COUSINS,"Countries. He prays her to hang 'em when they re-enter her realms. (Hm,"
1194,THE TWO COUSINS,that's as may be.) Here's a list of burnt shipping slipped between two
1195,THE TWO COUSINS,"vows of burning adoration. Oh, poor Philip! His admirals at sea--no less"
1196,THE TWO COUSINS,"than three of 'em--have been boarded, sacked, and scuttled on their"
1197,THE TWO COUSINS,"lawful voyages by certain English mariners (gentlemen, he will not call"
1198,THE TWO COUSINS,"them), who are now at large and working more piracies in _his_ American"
1199,THE TWO COUSINS,"ocean, which the Pope gave him. (He and the Pope should guard it, then!)"
1200,THE TWO COUSINS,"Philip hears, but his devout ears will not credit it, that Gloriana in"
1201,THE TWO COUSINS,"some fashion countenances these villains' misdeeds, shares in their"
1202,THE TWO COUSINS,"booty, and--oh, shame!--has even lent them ships royal for their sinful"
1203,THE TWO COUSINS,"thefts. Therefore he requires (which is a word Gloriana loves not),"
1204,THE TWO COUSINS,"_requires_ that she shall hang 'em when they return to England, and"
1205,THE TWO COUSINS,afterwards shall account to him for all the goods and gold they have
1206,THE TWO COUSINS,plundered. A most loving request! If Gloriana will not be Philip's
1207,THE TWO COUSINS,"bride, she shall be his broker and his butcher! Should she still be"
1208,THE TWO COUSINS,"stiff-necked, he writes--see where the pen digged the innocent"
1209,THE TWO COUSINS,paper!--that he hath both the means and the intention to be revenged on
1210,THE TWO COUSINS,her. Aha! Now we come to the Spaniard in his shirt!' (She waved the
1211,THE TWO COUSINS,letter merrily.) 'Listen here! Philip will prepare for Gloriana a
1212,THE TWO COUSINS,destruction from the West--a destruction from the West--far exceeding
1213,THE TWO COUSINS,that which Pedro de Avila wrought upon the Huguenots. And he rests and
1214,THE TWO COUSINS,"remains, kissing her feet and her hands, her slave, her enemy, or her"
1215,THE TWO COUSINS,"conqueror, as he shall find that she uses him.'"
1216,THE TWO COUSINS,
1217,THE TWO COUSINS,"She thrust back the letter under her cloak, and went on acting, but in a"
1218,THE TWO COUSINS,softer voice. 'All this while--hark to it--the wind blows through
1219,THE TWO COUSINS,"Brickwall Oak, the music plays, and, with the company's eyes upon her,"
1220,THE TWO COUSINS,the Queen of England must think what this means. She cannot remember the
1221,THE TWO COUSINS,"name of Pedro de Avila, nor what he did to the Huguenots, nor when, nor"
1222,THE TWO COUSINS,where. She can only see darkly some dark motion moving in Philip's dark
1223,THE TWO COUSINS,"mind, for he hath never written before in this fashion. She must smile"
1224,THE TWO COUSINS,above the letter as though it were good news from her ministers--the
1225,THE TWO COUSINS,smile that tires the mouth and the poor heart. What shall she do?' Again
1226,THE TWO COUSINS,her voice changed.
1227,THE TWO COUSINS,
1228,THE TWO COUSINS,"'You are to fancy that the music of a sudden wavers away. Chris Hatton,"
1229,THE TWO COUSINS,"Captain of her bodyguard, quits the table all red and ruffled, and"
1230,THE TWO COUSINS,Gloriana's virgin ear catches the clash of swords at work behind a wall.
1231,THE TWO COUSINS,The mothers of Sussex look round to count their chicks--I mean those
1232,THE TWO COUSINS,young game-cocks that waited on her. Two dainty youths have stepped
1233,THE TWO COUSINS,aside into Brickwall garden with rapier and dagger on a private point of
1234,THE TWO COUSINS,"honour. They are haled out through the gate, disarmed and glaring--the"
1235,THE TWO COUSINS,"lively image of a brace of young Cupids transformed into pale, panting"
1236,THE TWO COUSINS,Cains. Ahem! Gloriana beckons awfully--thus! They come up for judgment.
1237,THE TWO COUSINS,"Their lives and estates lie at her mercy whom they have doubly offended,"
1238,THE TWO COUSINS,both as Queen and woman. But la! what will not foolish young men do for
1239,THE TWO COUSINS,a beautiful maid?'
1240,THE TWO COUSINS,
1241,THE TWO COUSINS,'Why? What did she do? What had they done?' said Una.
1242,THE TWO COUSINS,
1243,THE TWO COUSINS,'Hsh! You mar the play! Gloriana had guessed the cause of the trouble.
1244,THE TWO COUSINS,They were handsome lads. So she frowns a while and tells 'em not to be
1245,THE TWO COUSINS,"bigger fools than their mothers had made 'em, and warns 'em, if they do"
1246,THE TWO COUSINS,"not kiss and be friends on the instant, she'll have Chris Hatton horse"
1247,THE TWO COUSINS,and birch 'em in the style of the new school at Harrow. (Chris looks
1248,THE TWO COUSINS,"sour at that.) Lastly, because she needed time to think on Philip's"
1249,THE TWO COUSINS,"letter burning in her pocket, she signifies her pleasure to dance with"
1250,THE TWO COUSINS,'em and teach 'em better manners. Whereat the revived company call down
1251,THE TWO COUSINS,Heaven's blessing on her gracious head; Chris and the others prepare
1252,THE TWO COUSINS,"Brickwall House for a dance, and she walks in the clipped garden between"
1253,THE TWO COUSINS,those two lovely young sinners who are both ready to sink for shame.
1254,THE TWO COUSINS,They confess their fault. It appears that midway in the banquet the
1255,THE TWO COUSINS,elder--they were cousins--conceived that the Queen looked upon him with
1256,THE TWO COUSINS,"special favour. The younger, taking the look to himself, after some"
1257,THE TWO COUSINS,"words gives the elder the lie; hence, as she guessed, the duel.'"
1258,THE TWO COUSINS,
1259,THE TWO COUSINS,'And which had she really looked at?' Dan asked.
1260,THE TWO COUSINS,
1261,THE TWO COUSINS,"[Illustration: 'Admiral Boy--Vice-Admiral Babe,' says Gloriana, 'I cry"
1262,THE TWO COUSINS,your pardon.'--P. 41.]
1263,THE TWO COUSINS,
1264,THE TWO COUSINS,'Neither--except to wish them farther off. She was afraid all the while
1265,THE TWO COUSINS,"they'd spill dishes on her gown. She tells 'em this, poor chicks--and"
1266,THE TWO COUSINS,"it completes their abasement. When they had grilled long enough, she"
1267,THE TWO COUSINS,"says: ""And so you would have fleshed your maiden swords for me--for me?"""
1268,THE TWO COUSINS,"Faith, they would have been at it again if she'd egged 'em on! but their"
1269,THE TWO COUSINS,"swords--oh, prettily they said it!--had been drawn for her once or twice"
1270,THE TWO COUSINS,already.
1271,THE TWO COUSINS,
1272,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""And where?"" says she. ""On your hobby-horses before you were breeched?"""
1273,THE TWO COUSINS,
1274,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""On my own ship,"" says the elder. ""My cousin was vice-admiral of our"

1277,THE TWO COUSINS,
1278,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""No, no,"" says the younger, and flames like a very Tudor rose. ""At"

1280,THE TWO COUSINS,
1281,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Admiral Boy--Vice-Admiral Babe,"" says Gloriana, ""I cry your pardon."
1282,THE TWO COUSINS,The heat of these present times ripens childhood to age more quickly
1283,THE TWO COUSINS,than I can follow. But we are at peace with Spain. Where did you break
1284,THE TWO COUSINS,"your Queen's peace?"""
1285,THE TWO COUSINS,
1286,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""On the sea called the Spanish Main, though 'tis no more Spanish than"
1287,THE TWO COUSINS,"my doublet,"" says the elder. Guess how that warmed Gloriana's already"
1288,THE TWO COUSINS,melting heart! She would never suffer any sea to be called Spanish in
1289,THE TWO COUSINS,her private hearing.
1290,THE TWO COUSINS,
1291,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""And why was I not told? What booty got you, and where have you hid it?"
1292,THE TWO COUSINS,"Disclose,"" says she. ""You stand in some danger of the gallows for"
1293,THE TWO COUSINS,"pirates."""
1294,THE TWO COUSINS,
1295,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""The axe, most gracious lady,"" says the elder, ""for we are gentle"
1296,THE TWO COUSINS,"born."" He spoke truth, but no woman can brook contradiction."
1297,THE TWO COUSINS,"""Hoity-toity,"" says she, and, but that she remembered that she was a"
1298,THE TWO COUSINS,"Queen, she'd have cuffed the pair of 'em. ""It shall be gallows, hurdle,"

1300,THE TWO COUSINS,
1301,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Had our Queen known of our going beforehand, Philip might have held"
1302,THE TWO COUSINS,"her to blame for some small things we did on the seas,"" the younger"
1303,THE TWO COUSINS,lisps.
1304,THE TWO COUSINS,
1305,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""As for treasure,"" says the elder, ""we brought back but our bare lives."
1306,THE TWO COUSINS,"We were wrecked on the Gascons' Graveyard, where our sole company for"
1307,THE TWO COUSINS,"three months was the bleached bones of De Avila's men."""
1308,THE TWO COUSINS,
1309,THE TWO COUSINS,'Gloriana's mind jumped back to Philip's last letter.
1310,THE TWO COUSINS,
1311,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""De Avila that destroyed the Huguenots? What d'you know of him?"" she"
1312,THE TWO COUSINS,"says. The music called from the house here, and they three turned back"
1313,THE TWO COUSINS,between the yews.
1314,THE TWO COUSINS,
1315,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Simply that De Avila broke in upon a plantation of Frenchmen on that"

1317,THE TWO COUSINS,"so. The next year Dominique de Gorgues, a Gascon, broke in upon De"
1318,THE TWO COUSINS,"Avila's men, and very justly hung 'em all for murderers--five hundred or"

1321,THE TWO COUSINS,

1323,THE TWO COUSINS,
1324,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""With a fair wind, six weeks. They say that Philip will plant it again"
1325,THE TWO COUSINS,"soon."" This was the younger, and he looked at her out of the corner of"
1326,THE TWO COUSINS,his innocent eye.
1327,THE TWO COUSINS,
1328,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Chris Hatton, fuming, meets and leads her into Brickwall Hall, where"
1329,THE TWO COUSINS,she dances--thus. A woman can think while she dances--can think. I'll
1330,THE TWO COUSINS,show you. Watch!'
1331,THE TWO COUSINS,
1332,THE TWO COUSINS,"She took off her cloak slowly, and stood forth in dove-coloured satin,"
1333,THE TWO COUSINS,worked over with pearls that trembled like running water in the running
1334,THE TWO COUSINS,shadows of the trees. Still talking--more to herself than to the
1335,THE TWO COUSINS,"children--she swam into a majestical dance of the stateliest balancings,"
1336,THE TWO COUSINS,"the haughtiest wheelings and turnings aside, the most dignified"
1337,THE TWO COUSINS,"sinkings, the gravest risings, all joined together by the elaboratest"
1338,THE TWO COUSINS,interlacing steps and circles.
1339,THE TWO COUSINS,
1340,THE TWO COUSINS,They leaned forward breathlessly to watch the splendid acting.
1341,THE TWO COUSINS,
1342,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Would a Spaniard,' she began, looking on the ground, 'speak of his"
1343,THE TWO COUSINS,revenge till his revenge were ripe? No. Yet a man who loved a woman
1344,THE TWO COUSINS,might threaten her in the hope that his threats would make her love him.
1345,THE TWO COUSINS,Such things have been.' She moved slowly across a bar of sunlight. 'A
1346,THE TWO COUSINS,destruction from the West may signify that Philip means to descend on
1347,THE TWO COUSINS,Ireland. But then my Irish spies would have had some warning. The Irish
1348,THE TWO COUSINS,keep no secrets. No--it is not Ireland. Now why--why--why'--the red
1349,THE TWO COUSINS,"shoes clicked and paused--'does Philip name Pedro Melendez de Avila, a"
1350,THE TWO COUSINS,"general in his Americas, unless'--she turned more quickly--'unless he"
1351,THE TWO COUSINS,intends to work his destruction from the Americas? Did he say De Avila
1352,THE TWO COUSINS,"only to put her off her guard, or for this once has his black pen"
1353,THE TWO COUSINS,betrayed his black heart? We'--she raised herself to her full
1354,THE TWO COUSINS,"height--'England must forestall Master Philip. But not openly,' she sank"
1355,THE TWO COUSINS,again--'we cannot fight Spain openly--not yet--not yet.' She stepped
1356,THE TWO COUSINS,three paces as though she were pegging down some snare with her
1357,THE TWO COUSINS,twinkling shoe-buckles. 'The Queen's mad gentlemen may fight Philip's
1358,THE TWO COUSINS,"poor admirals where they find 'em, but England, Gloriana, Harry's"
1359,THE TWO COUSINS,"daughter, must keep the peace. Perhaps, after all, Philip loves her--as"
1360,THE TWO COUSINS,"many men and boys do. That may help England. Oh, _what_ shall help"
1361,THE TWO COUSINS,England?'
1362,THE TWO COUSINS,
1363,THE TWO COUSINS,She raised her head--the masked head that seemed to have nothing to do
1364,THE TWO COUSINS,with the busy feet--and stared straight at the children.
1365,THE TWO COUSINS,
1366,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I think this is rather creepy,' said Una with a shiver. 'I wish she'd"
1367,THE TWO COUSINS,stop.'
1368,THE TWO COUSINS,
1369,THE TWO COUSINS,The lady held out her jewelled hand as though she were taking some one
1370,THE TWO COUSINS,else's hand in the Grand Chain.
1371,THE TWO COUSINS,
1372,THE TWO COUSINS,'Can a ship go down into the Gascons' Graveyard and wait there?' she
1373,THE TWO COUSINS,"asked into the air, and passed on rustling."
1374,THE TWO COUSINS,
1375,THE TWO COUSINS,"'She's pretending to ask one of the cousins, isn't she?' said Dan, and"
1376,THE TWO COUSINS,Puck nodded.
1377,THE TWO COUSINS,
1378,THE TWO COUSINS,"Back she came in the silent, swaying, ghostly dance. They saw she was"
1379,THE TWO COUSINS,"smiling beneath the mask, and they could hear her breathing hard."
1380,THE TWO COUSINS,
1381,THE TWO COUSINS,'I cannot lend you any my ships for the venture; Philip would hear of
1382,THE TWO COUSINS,"it,' she whispered over her shoulder; 'but as much guns and powder as"
1383,THE TWO COUSINS,"you ask, if you do not ask too----' her voice shot up and she stamped"
1384,THE TWO COUSINS,"her foot thrice. 'Louder! Louder, the music in the gallery! Oh, me, but"
1385,THE TWO COUSINS,I have burst out of my shoe!'
1386,THE TWO COUSINS,
1387,THE TWO COUSINS,"She gathered her skirts in each hand, and began a curtsy. 'You will go"
1388,THE TWO COUSINS,"at your own charges,' she whispered straight before her. 'Oh, enviable"
1389,THE TWO COUSINS,and adorable age of youth!' Her eyes shone through the mask-holes. 'But
1390,THE TWO COUSINS,I warn you you'll repent it. Put not your trust in princes--or Queens.
1391,THE TWO COUSINS,"Philip's ships'll blow you out of water. You'll not be frightened? Well,"
1392,THE TWO COUSINS,"we'll talk on it again, when I return from Rye, dear lads.'"
1393,THE TWO COUSINS,
1394,THE TWO COUSINS,The wonderful curtsy ended. She stood up. Nothing stirred on her except
1395,THE TWO COUSINS,the rush of the shadows.
1396,THE TWO COUSINS,
1397,THE TWO COUSINS,"'And so it was finished,' she said to the children. 'Why d'you not"
1398,THE TWO COUSINS,applaud?'
1399,THE TWO COUSINS,
1400,THE TWO COUSINS,'What was finished?' said Una.
1401,THE TWO COUSINS,
1402,THE TWO COUSINS,"'The dance,' the lady replied offendedly. 'And a pair of green shoes.'"
1403,THE TWO COUSINS,
1404,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I don't understand a bit,' said Una."
1405,THE TWO COUSINS,
1406,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Eh? What did _you_ make of it, young Burleigh?'"
1407,THE TWO COUSINS,
1408,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I'm not quite sure,' Dan began, 'but----'"
1409,THE TWO COUSINS,
1410,THE TWO COUSINS,'You never can be--with a woman. But----'
1411,THE TWO COUSINS,
1412,THE TWO COUSINS,'But I thought Gloriana meant the cousins to go back to the Gascons'
1413,THE TWO COUSINS,"Graveyard, wherever that was.'"
1414,THE TWO COUSINS,
1415,THE TWO COUSINS,''Twas Virginia afterwards. Her plantation of Virginia.'
1416,THE TWO COUSINS,
1417,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Virginia afterwards, and stop Philip from taking it. Didn't she say"
1418,THE TWO COUSINS,she'd lend 'em guns?'
1419,THE TWO COUSINS,
1420,THE TWO COUSINS,'Right so. But not ships--_then_.'
1421,THE TWO COUSINS,
1422,THE TWO COUSINS,'And I thought you meant they must have told her they'd do it off their
1423,THE TWO COUSINS,"own bat, without getting her into a row with Philip. Was I right?'"
1424,THE TWO COUSINS,
1425,THE TWO COUSINS,'Near enough for a Minister of the Queen. But remember she gave the lads
1426,THE TWO COUSINS,full time to change their minds. She was three long days at Rye
1427,THE TWO COUSINS,"Royal--knighting of fat Mayors. When she came back to Brickwall, they"
1428,THE TWO COUSINS,"met her a mile down the road, and she could feel their eyes burn through"
1429,THE TWO COUSINS,"her riding-mask. Chris Hatton, poor fool, was vexed at it."
1430,THE TWO COUSINS,
1431,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""You would not birch them when I gave you the chance,"" says she to"
1432,THE TWO COUSINS,"Chris. ""Now you must get me half an hour's private speech with 'em in"
1433,THE TWO COUSINS,"Brickwall garden. Eve tempted Adam in a garden. Quick, man, or I may"
1434,THE TWO COUSINS,"repent!""'"
1435,THE TWO COUSINS,
1436,THE TWO COUSINS,"'She was a Queen. Why did she not send for them herself,' said Una."
1437,THE TWO COUSINS,
1438,THE TWO COUSINS,The lady shook her head. 'That was never her way. I've seen her walk to
1439,THE TWO COUSINS,"her own mirror by bye-ends, and the woman that cannot walk straight"
1440,THE TWO COUSINS,_there_ is past praying for. Yet I would have you pray for her! What
1441,THE TWO COUSINS,else--what else in England's name could she have done?' She lifted her
1442,THE TWO COUSINS,"hand to her throat for a moment. 'Faith,' she cried, 'I'd forgotten the"
1443,THE TWO COUSINS,little green shoes! She left 'em at Brickwall--so she did. And I
1444,THE TWO COUSINS,"remember she gave the Norgem parson--John Withers, was he?--a text for"
1445,THE TWO COUSINS,"his sermon--""Over Edom have I cast out my shoe."" Neat, if he'd"
1446,THE TWO COUSINS,understood!'
1447,THE TWO COUSINS,
1448,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I don't understand,' said Una. 'What about the two cousins?'"
1449,THE TWO COUSINS,
1450,THE TWO COUSINS,"'You are as cruel as a woman,' the lady answered. '_I_ was not to blame."
1451,THE TWO COUSINS,I told you I gave 'em time to change their minds. On my honour (_ay de
1452,THE TWO COUSINS,"mi!_), she asked no more of 'em at first than to wait a while off that"
1453,THE TWO COUSINS,coast--the Gascons' Graveyard--to hover a little if their ships chanced
1454,THE TWO COUSINS,to pass that way--they had only one tall ship and a pinnace--only to
1455,THE TWO COUSINS,watch and bring me word of Philip's doings. One must watch Philip
1456,THE TWO COUSINS,"always. What a murrain right had he to make any plantation there, a"
1457,THE TWO COUSINS,"hundred leagues north of his Spanish Main, and only six weeks from"
1458,THE TWO COUSINS,"England? By my dread father's soul, I tell you he had none--none!' She"
1459,THE TWO COUSINS,"stamped her red foot again, and the two children shrunk back for a"
1460,THE TWO COUSINS,second.
1461,THE TWO COUSINS,
1462,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Nay, nay. You must not turn from me too! She laid it all fairly before"
1463,THE TWO COUSINS,the lads in Brickwall garden between the yews. I told 'em that if Philip
1464,THE TWO COUSINS,"sent a fleet (and to make a plantation he could not well send less),"
1465,THE TWO COUSINS,"their poor little cock-boats could not sink it. They answered that, with"
1466,THE TWO COUSINS,"submission, the fight would be their own concern. She showed 'em again"
1467,THE TWO COUSINS,"that there could be only one end to it--quick death on the sea, or slow"
1468,THE TWO COUSINS,death in Philip's prisons. They asked no more than to embrace death for
1469,THE TWO COUSINS,"my sake. Many men have prayed to me for life. I've refused 'em, and"
1470,THE TWO COUSINS,"slept none the worse after; but when my men, my tall, fantastical young"
1471,THE TWO COUSINS,"men beseech me on their knees for leave to die for me, it shakes"
1472,THE TWO COUSINS,"me--ah, it shakes me to the marrow of my old bones.'"
1473,THE TWO COUSINS,
1474,THE TWO COUSINS,Her chest sounded like a board as she hit it.
1475,THE TWO COUSINS,
1476,THE TWO COUSINS,'She showed 'em all. I told 'em that this was no time for open war with
1477,THE TWO COUSINS,Spain. If by miracle inconceivable they prevailed against Philip's
1478,THE TWO COUSINS,"fleet, Philip would hold me accountable. For England's sake, to save"
1479,THE TWO COUSINS,"war, I should e'en be forced (I told 'em so) to give him up their young"
1480,THE TWO COUSINS,"lives. If they failed, and again by some miracle escaped Philip's hand,"
1481,THE TWO COUSINS,"and crept back to England with their bare lives, they must lie--oh, I"
1482,THE TWO COUSINS,"told 'em all--under my sovereign displeasure. She could not know them,"
1483,THE TWO COUSINS,"see them, nor hear their names, nor stretch out a finger to save them"
1484,THE TWO COUSINS,"from the gallows, if Philip chose to ask it."
1485,THE TWO COUSINS,
1486,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Be it the gallows, then,"" says the elder. (I could have wept, but that"
1487,THE TWO COUSINS,my face was made for the day.)
1488,THE TWO COUSINS,
1489,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Either way--any way--this venture is death, which I know you fear not."
1490,THE TWO COUSINS,"But it is death with assured dishonour,"" I cried."
1491,THE TWO COUSINS,
1492,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Yet our Queen will know in her heart what we have done,"" says the"
1493,THE TWO COUSINS,younger.
1494,THE TWO COUSINS,
1495,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Sweetheart,"" I said. ""A queen has no heart."""
1496,THE TWO COUSINS,
1497,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""But she is a woman, and a woman would not forget,"" says the elder. ""We"
1498,THE TWO COUSINS,"will go!"" They knelt at my feet."
1499,THE TWO COUSINS,
1500,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Nay, dear lads--but here!"" I said, and I opened my arms to them and I"
1501,THE TWO COUSINS,kissed them.
1502,THE TWO COUSINS,
1503,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Be ruled by me,"" I said. ""We'll hire some ill-featured old"
1504,THE TWO COUSINS,"tarry-breeks of an admiral to watch the Graveyard, and you shall come"
1505,THE TWO COUSINS,"to Court."""
1506,THE TWO COUSINS,
1507,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Hire whom you please,"" says the elder; ""we are ruled by you, body and"
1508,THE TWO COUSINS,"soul""; and the younger, who shook most when I kissed 'em, says between"
1509,THE TWO COUSINS,"his white lips, ""I think you have power to make a god of a man."""
1510,THE TWO COUSINS,
1511,THE TWO COUSINS,"'""Come to Court and be sure of it,"" I says."
1512,THE TWO COUSINS,
1513,THE TWO COUSINS,"'They shook their heads and I knew--I knew, that go they would. If I had"
1514,THE TWO COUSINS,not kissed them--perhaps I might have prevailed.'
1515,THE TWO COUSINS,
1516,THE TWO COUSINS,'Then why did you do it?' said Una. 'I don't think you knew really what
1517,THE TWO COUSINS,you wanted done.'
1518,THE TWO COUSINS,
1519,THE TWO COUSINS,"'May it please your Majesty,' the lady bowed her head low, 'this"
1520,THE TWO COUSINS,Gloriana whom I have represented for your pleasure was a woman and a
1521,THE TWO COUSINS,Queen. Remember her when you come to your kingdom.'
1522,THE TWO COUSINS,
1523,THE TWO COUSINS,"'But did the cousins go to the Gascons' Graveyard?' said Dan, as Una"
1524,THE TWO COUSINS,frowned.
1525,THE TWO COUSINS,
1526,THE TWO COUSINS,"'They went,' said the lady."
1527,THE TWO COUSINS,
1528,THE TWO COUSINS,'Did they ever come back?' Una began; but--'Did they stop King Philip's
1529,THE TWO COUSINS,fleet?' Dan interrupted.
1530,THE TWO COUSINS,
1531,THE TWO COUSINS,The lady turned to him eagerly.
1532,THE TWO COUSINS,
1533,THE TWO COUSINS,'D'you think they did right to go?' she asked.
1534,THE TWO COUSINS,
1535,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I don't see what else they could have done,' Dan replied, after"
1536,THE TWO COUSINS,thinking it over.
1537,THE TWO COUSINS,
1538,THE TWO COUSINS,'D'you think she did right to send 'em?' The lady's voice rose a little.
1539,THE TWO COUSINS,
1540,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Well,' said Dan, 'I don't see what else she could have done, either--do"
1541,THE TWO COUSINS,you? How did they stop King Philip from getting Virginia?'
1542,THE TWO COUSINS,
1543,THE TWO COUSINS,"'There's the sad part of it. They sailed out that autumn from Rye Royal,"
1544,THE TWO COUSINS,and there never came back so much as a single rope-yarn to show what had
1545,THE TWO COUSINS,"befallen them. The winds blew, and they were not. Does that make you"
1546,THE TWO COUSINS,"alter your mind, young Burleigh?'"
1547,THE TWO COUSINS,
1548,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I expect they were drowned, then. Anyhow, Philip didn't score, did he?'"
1549,THE TWO COUSINS,
1550,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Gloriana wiped out her score with Philip later. But if Philip had won,"
1551,THE TWO COUSINS,would you have blamed Gloriana for wasting those lads' lives?'
1552,THE TWO COUSINS,
1553,THE TWO COUSINS,'Of course not. She was bound to try to stop him.'
1554,THE TWO COUSINS,
1555,THE TWO COUSINS,"The lady coughed. 'You have the root of the matter in you. Were I Queen,"
1556,THE TWO COUSINS,I'd make you Minister.'
1557,THE TWO COUSINS,
1558,THE TWO COUSINS,"'We don't play that game,' said Una, who felt that she disliked the lady"
1559,THE TWO COUSINS,as much as she disliked the noise the high wind made tearing through
1560,THE TWO COUSINS,Willow Shaw.
1561,THE TWO COUSINS,
1562,THE TWO COUSINS,"'Play!' said the lady with a laugh, and threw up her hands affectedly."
1563,THE TWO COUSINS,The sunshine caught the jewels on her many rings and made them flash
1564,THE TWO COUSINS,"till Una's eyes dazzled, and she had to rub them. Then she saw Dan on"
1565,THE TWO COUSINS,his knees picking up the potatoes they had spilled at the gate.
1566,THE TWO COUSINS,
1567,THE TWO COUSINS,"'There wasn't anybody in the Shaw, after all,' he said. 'Didn't you"
1568,THE TWO COUSINS,think you saw some one?'
1569,THE TWO COUSINS,
1570,THE TWO COUSINS,"'I'm most awfully glad there isn't,' said Una. Then they went on with"
1571,THE TWO COUSINS,the potato-roast.

1699,THE SAILOR:--,Dan had gone in for building model boats; but after he had filled the
1700,THE SAILOR:--,"schoolroom with chips, which he expected Una to clear away, they turned"
1701,THE SAILOR:--,him out of doors and he took all his tools up the hill to Mr.
1702,THE SAILOR:--,"Springett's yard, where he knew he could make as much mess as he chose."
1703,THE SAILOR:--,"Old Mr. Springett was a builder, contractor, and sanitary engineer, and"
1704,THE SAILOR:--,"his yard, which opened off the village street, was always full of"
1705,THE SAILOR:--,"interesting things. At one end of it was a long loft, reached by a"
1706,THE SAILOR:--,"ladder, where he kept his iron-bound scaffold planks, tins of paints,"
1707,THE SAILOR:--,"pulleys, and odds and ends he had found in old houses. He would sit here"
1708,THE SAILOR:--,by the hour watching his carts as they loaded or unloaded in the yard
1709,THE SAILOR:--,"below, while Dan gouged and grunted at the carpenter's bench near the"
1710,THE SAILOR:--,"loft window. Mr. Springett and Dan had always been particular friends,"
1711,THE SAILOR:--,for Mr. Springett was so old he could remember when railways were being
1712,THE SAILOR:--,"made in the southern counties of England, and people were allowed to"
1713,THE SAILOR:--,drive dogs in carts.
1714,THE SAILOR:--,
1715,THE SAILOR:--,"One hot, still afternoon--the tar-paper on the roof smelt like"
1716,THE SAILOR:--,"ships--Dan, in his shirt sleeves, was smoothing down a new schooner's"
1717,THE SAILOR:--,"bow, and Mr. Springett was talking of barns and houses he had built. He"
1718,THE SAILOR:--,"said he never forgot any stick or stone he had ever handled, or any man,"
1719,THE SAILOR:--,"woman, or child he had ever met. Just then he was very proud of the"
1720,THE SAILOR:--,"village Hall at the entrance to the village, which he had finished a few"
1721,THE SAILOR:--,weeks before.
1722,THE SAILOR:--,
1723,THE SAILOR:--,"'An' I don't mind tellin' you, Mus' Dan,' he said, 'that the Hall will"
1724,THE SAILOR:--,"be my last job top of this mortal earth. I didn't make ten pounds--no,"
1725,THE SAILOR:--,"nor yet five--out o' the whole contrac', but my name's lettered on the"
1726,THE SAILOR:--,"foundation stone--_Ralph Springett, Builder_--and the stone she's bedded"
1727,THE SAILOR:--,on four foot good concrete. If she shifts any time these five hundred
1728,THE SAILOR:--,"years, I'll sure-ly turn in my grave. I told the Lunnon architec' so"
1729,THE SAILOR:--,when he come down to oversee my work.'
1730,THE SAILOR:--,
1731,THE SAILOR:--,'What did he say?' Dan was sandpapering the schooner's port bow.
1732,THE SAILOR:--,
1733,THE SAILOR:--,"'Nothing. The Hall ain't more than one of his small jobs for _him_, but"
1734,THE SAILOR:--,"'tain't small to me, an' my name is cut and lettered, frontin' the"
1735,THE SAILOR:--,"village street, I do hope an' pray, for time everlastin.' You'll want"
1736,THE SAILOR:--,the little round file for that holler in her bow. Who's there?' Mr.
1737,THE SAILOR:--,Springett turned stiffly in his chair.
1738,THE SAILOR:--,
1739,THE SAILOR:--,A long pile of scaffold-planks ran down the centre of the loft. Dan
1740,THE SAILOR:--,"looked, and saw Hal of the Draft's touzled head beyond them.[3]"
1741,THE SAILOR:--,
1742,THE SAILOR:--,[3] See 'Hal o' the Draft' in _Puck of Pook's Hill_.
1743,THE SAILOR:--,
1744,THE SAILOR:--,'Be you the builder of the village Hall?' he asked of Mr. Springett.
1745,THE SAILOR:--,
1746,THE SAILOR:--,"'I be,' was the answer. 'But if you want a job----'"
1747,THE SAILOR:--,
1748,THE SAILOR:--,"Hal laughed. 'No, faith!' he said. 'Only the Hall is as good and honest"
1749,THE SAILOR:--,"a piece of work as I've ever run a rule over. So, being born hereabouts,"
1750,THE SAILOR:--,"and being reckoned a master among masons, and accepted as a master"
1751,THE SAILOR:--,"mason, I made bold to pay my brotherly respects to the builder.'"
1752,THE SAILOR:--,
1753,THE SAILOR:--,"'Aa--um!' Mr. Springett looked important. 'I be a bit rusty, but I'll"
1754,THE SAILOR:--,try ye!'
1755,THE SAILOR:--,
1756,THE SAILOR:--,"He asked Hal several curious questions, and the answers must have"
1757,THE SAILOR:--,"pleased him, for he invited Hal to sit down. Hal moved up, always"
1758,THE SAILOR:--,"keeping behind the pile of planks so that only his head showed, and sat"
1759,THE SAILOR:--,down on a trestle in the dark corner at the back of Mr. Springett's
1760,THE SAILOR:--,"desk. He took no notice of Dan, but talked at once to Mr. Springett"
1761,THE SAILOR:--,"about bricks, and cement, and lead and glass, and after a while Dan went"
1762,THE SAILOR:--,"on with his work. He knew Mr. Springett was pleased, because he tugged"
1763,THE SAILOR:--,"his white sandy beard, and smoked his pipe in short puffs. The two men"
1764,THE SAILOR:--,"seemed to agree about everything, but when grown-ups agree they"
1765,THE SAILOR:--,interrupt each other almost as much as if they were quarrelling. Hal
1766,THE SAILOR:--,said something about workmen.
1767,THE SAILOR:--,
1768,THE SAILOR:--,"'Why, that's what _I_ always say,' Mr. Springett cried. 'A man who can"
1769,THE SAILOR:--,"only do one thing, he's but next-above-fool to the man that can't do"
1770,THE SAILOR:--,nothing. That's where the Unions make their mistake.'
1771,THE SAILOR:--,
1772,THE SAILOR:--,'My thought to the very dot.' Dan heard Hal slap his tight-hosed leg.
1773,THE SAILOR:--,'I've suffered in my time from these same Guilds--Unions d'you call 'em?
1774,THE SAILOR:--,"All their precious talk of the mysteries of their trades--why, what"
1775,THE SAILOR:--,does it come to?'
1776,THE SAILOR:--,
1777,THE SAILOR:--,"'Nothin'! You've just about hit it,' said Mr. Springett, and rammed his"
1778,THE SAILOR:--,hot tobacco with his thumb.
1779,THE SAILOR:--,
1780,THE SAILOR:--,"'Take the art of wood-carving,' Hal went on. He reached across the"
1781,THE SAILOR:--,"planks, grabbed a wooden mallet, and moved his other hand as though he"
1782,THE SAILOR:--,wanted something. Mr. Springett without a word passed him one of Dan's
1783,THE SAILOR:--,"broad chisels. 'Ah! Wood-carving, for example. If you can cut wood and"
1784,THE SAILOR:--,"have a fair draft of what ye mean to do, a Heaven's name take chisel and"
1785,THE SAILOR:--,"mall and let drive at it, say I! You'll soon find all the mystery,"
1786,THE SAILOR:--,"forsooth, of wood-carving under your proper hand!' Whack, came the"
1787,THE SAILOR:--,"mallet on the chisel, and a sliver of wood curled up in front of it. Mr."
1788,THE SAILOR:--,Springett watched like an old raven.
1789,THE SAILOR:--,
1790,THE SAILOR:--,"'All art is one, man--one!' said Hal between whacks; 'and to wait on"
1791,THE SAILOR:--,another man to finish out----'
1792,THE SAILOR:--,
1793,THE SAILOR:--,"'To finish out your work ain't no sense,' Mr. Springett cut in. 'That's"
1794,THE SAILOR:--,what I'm always saying to the boy here.' He nodded towards Dan. 'That's
1795,THE SAILOR:--,what I said when I put the new wheel into Brewster's Mill in Eighteen
1796,THE SAILOR:--,hundred Seventy-two. I reckoned I was millwright enough for the job
1797,THE SAILOR:--,"'thout bringin' a man from Lunnon. An' besides, dividin' work eats up"
1798,THE SAILOR:--,"profits, no bounds.'"
1799,THE SAILOR:--,
1800,THE SAILOR:--,"Hal laughed his beautiful deep laugh, and Mr. Springett joined in till"
1801,THE SAILOR:--,Dan laughed too.
1802,THE SAILOR:--,
1803,THE SAILOR:--,"'You handle your tools, I can see,' said Mr. Springett. 'I reckon, if"
1804,THE SAILOR:--,"you're any way like me, you've found yourself hindered by those--Guilds,"
1805,THE SAILOR:--,"did you call 'em?--Unions, we say.'"
1806,THE SAILOR:--,
1807,THE SAILOR:--,'You may say so!' Hal pointed to a white scar on his cheek-bone. 'This
1808,THE SAILOR:--,is a remembrance from the master watching Foreman of Masons on Magdalen
1809,THE SAILOR:--,"Tower, because, please you, I dared to carve stone without their leave."
1810,THE SAILOR:--,They said a stone had slipped from the cornice by accident.'
1811,THE SAILOR:--,
1812,THE SAILOR:--,'I know them accidents. There's no way to disprove 'em. An' stones ain't
1813,THE SAILOR:--,"the only things that slip,' Mr. Springett grunted. Hal went on:"
1814,THE SAILOR:--,
1815,THE SAILOR:--,'I've seen a scaffold-plank keckle and shoot a too-clever workman thirty
1816,THE SAILOR:--,foot on to the cold chancel floor below. And a rope can break----'
1817,THE SAILOR:--,
1818,THE SAILOR:--,"'Yes, natural as nature; an' lime'll fly up in a man's eyes without any"
1819,THE SAILOR:--,"breath o' wind sometimes,' said Mr. Springett. 'But who's to show"
1820,THE SAILOR:--,'twasn't a accident?'
1821,THE SAILOR:--,
1822,THE SAILOR:--,"'Who do these things?' Dan asked, and straightened his back at the bench"
1823,THE SAILOR:--,as he turned the schooner end-for-end in the vice to get at her counter.
1824,THE SAILOR:--,
1825,THE SAILOR:--,'Them which don't wish other men to work no better nor quicker than they
1826,THE SAILOR:--,"do,' growled Mr. Springett. 'Don't pinch her so hard in the vice, Mus'"
1827,THE SAILOR:--,"Dan. Put a piece o' rag in the jaws, or you'll bruise her. More than"
1828,THE SAILOR:--,that'--he turned towards Hal--'if a man has his private spite laid up
1829,THE SAILOR:--,"against you, the Unions give him his excuse for working it off.'"
1830,THE SAILOR:--,
1831,THE SAILOR:--,"'Well I know it,' said Hal."
1832,THE SAILOR:--,
1833,THE SAILOR:--,"'They never let you go, them spiteful ones. I knowed a plasterer in"
1834,THE SAILOR:--,Eighteen hundred Sixty-one--down to the Wells. He was a Frenchy--a bad
1835,THE SAILOR:--,enemy he was.'
1836,THE SAILOR:--,
1837,THE SAILOR:--,"'I had mine too. He was an Italian, called Benedetto. I met him first at"
1838,THE SAILOR:--,"Oxford on Magdalen Tower when I was learning my trade--or trades, I"
1839,THE SAILOR:--,"should say. A bad enemy he was, as you say, but he came to be my"
1840,THE SAILOR:--,"singular good friend,' said Hal as he put down the mallet and settled"
1841,THE SAILOR:--,himself comfortably.
1842,THE SAILOR:--,
1843,THE SAILOR:--,'What might his trade have been--plasterin'?' Mr. Springett asked.
1844,THE SAILOR:--,
1845,THE SAILOR:--,'Plastering of a sort. He worked in stucco--fresco we call it. Made
1846,THE SAILOR:--,pictures on plaster. Not but what he had a fine sweep of the hand in
1847,THE SAILOR:--,"drawing. He'd take the long sides of a cloister, trowel on his stuff,"
1848,THE SAILOR:--,and roll out his great all-abroad pictures of saints and croppy-topped
1849,THE SAILOR:--,"trees quick as a webster unrolling cloth almost. Oh, Benedetto could"
1850,THE SAILOR:--,"draw, but a was a little-minded man, professing to be full of secrets of"
1851,THE SAILOR:--,"colour or plaster--common tricks, all of 'em--and his one single talk"
1852,THE SAILOR:--,"was how Tom, Dick or Harry had stole this or t'other secret art from"
1853,THE SAILOR:--,him.'
1854,THE SAILOR:--,
1855,THE SAILOR:--,"'I know that sort,' said Mr. Springett. 'There's no keeping peace or"
1856,THE SAILOR:--,making peace with such. An' they're mostly born an' bone idle.'
1857,THE SAILOR:--,
1858,THE SAILOR:--,'True. Even his fellow-countrymen laughed at his jealousy. We two came
1859,THE SAILOR:--,to loggerheads early on Magdalen Tower. I was a youngster then. Maybe I
1860,THE SAILOR:--,spoke my mind about his work.'
1861,THE SAILOR:--,
1862,THE SAILOR:--,'You shouldn't never do that.' Mr. Springett shook his head. 'That sort
1863,THE SAILOR:--,lay it up against you.'
1864,THE SAILOR:--,
1865,THE SAILOR:--,"'True enough. This Benedetto did most specially. Body o' me, the man"
1866,THE SAILOR:--,lived to hate me! But I always kept my eyes open on a plank or a
1867,THE SAILOR:--,scaffold. I was mighty glad to be shut of him when he quarrelled with
1868,THE SAILOR:--,"his Guild foreman, and went off, nose in air, and paints under his arm."
1869,THE SAILOR:--,But'--Hal leaned forward--'if you hate a man or a man hates you----'
1870,THE SAILOR:--,
1871,THE SAILOR:--,"'_I_ know. You're everlastin' running acrost him,' Mr. Springett"
1872,THE SAILOR:--,"interrupted. 'Excuse me, sir.' He leaned out of the window, and shouted"
1873,THE SAILOR:--,to a carter who was loading a cart with bricks.
1874,THE SAILOR:--,
1875,THE SAILOR:--,'Ain't you no more sense than to heap 'em up that way?' he said. 'Take
1876,THE SAILOR:--,an' throw a hundred of 'em off. It's more than the team can compass.
1877,THE SAILOR:--,"Throw 'em off, I tell you, and make another trip for what's left over."
1878,THE SAILOR:--,"Excuse me, sir. You was saying----'"
1879,THE SAILOR:--,
1880,THE SAILOR:--,'I was saying that before the end of the year I went to Bury to
1881,THE SAILOR:--,strengthen the lead-work in the great Abbey east window there.'
1882,THE SAILOR:--,
1883,THE SAILOR:--,'Now that's just one of the things I've never done. But I mind there was
1884,THE SAILOR:--,"a cheap excursion to Chichester in Eighteen hundred Seventy-nine, an' I"
1885,THE SAILOR:--,went an' watched 'em leading a won'erful fine window in Chichester
1886,THE SAILOR:--,Cathedral. I stayed watchin' till 'twas time for us to go back. Dunno as
1887,THE SAILOR:--,"I had two drinks p'raps, all that day.'"
1888,THE SAILOR:--,
1889,THE SAILOR:--,"Hal smiled. 'At Bury then, sure enough, I met my enemy Benedetto. He had"
1890,THE SAILOR:--,painted a picture in plaster on the south wall of the Refectory--a noble
1891,THE SAILOR:--,place for a noble thing--a picture of Jonah.'
1892,THE SAILOR:--,
1893,THE SAILOR:--,'Ah! Jonah an' his whale. I've never been as fur as Bury. You've worked
1894,THE SAILOR:--,"about a lot,' said Mr. Springett, with his eyes on the carter below."
1895,THE SAILOR:--,
1896,THE SAILOR:--,'No. Not the whale. This was a picture of Jonah and the pompion that
1897,THE SAILOR:--,withered. But all that Benedetto had shown was a peevish greybeard
1898,THE SAILOR:--,huggled up in angle-edged drapery beneath a pompion on a wooden trellis.
1899,THE SAILOR:--,"This last, being a dead thing, he'd drawn it as 'twere to the life. But"
1900,THE SAILOR:--,"fierce old Jonah, bared in the sun, angry even to death that his cold"
1901,THE SAILOR:--,"prophecy was disproven--Jonah, ashamed, and already hearing the children"
1902,THE SAILOR:--,"of Nineveh running to mock him--ah, that was what Benedetto had _not_"
1903,THE SAILOR:--,drawn!'
1904,THE SAILOR:--,
1905,THE SAILOR:--,"'He better ha' stuck to his whale, then,' said Mr. Springett."
1906,THE SAILOR:--,
1907,THE SAILOR:--,'He'd ha' done no better with that. He draws the damp cloth off the
1908,THE SAILOR:--,"picture, an' shows it to me. I was a craftsman too, d'ye see?"
1909,THE SAILOR:--,
1910,THE SAILOR:--,"'""'Tis good,"" I said, ""but it goes no deeper than the plaster."""
1911,THE SAILOR:--,
1912,THE SAILOR:--,"'""What?"" he said in a whisper."
1913,THE SAILOR:--,
1914,THE SAILOR:--,"'""Be thy own judge, Benedetto,"" I answered. ""Does it go deeper than the"
1915,THE SAILOR:--,"plaster?"""
1916,THE SAILOR:--,
1917,THE SAILOR:--,"'He reeled against a piece of dry wall. ""No,"" he says, ""and I know it. I"
1918,THE SAILOR:--,"could not hate thee more than I have done these five years, but if I"
1919,THE SAILOR:--,"live, I will try, Hal. I will try."" Then he goes away. I pitied him, but"
1920,THE SAILOR:--,I had spoken truth. His picture went no deeper than the plaster.'
1921,THE SAILOR:--,
1922,THE SAILOR:--,"'Ah!' said Mr. Springett, who had turned quite red. 'You was talkin' so"
1923,THE SAILOR:--,fast I didn't understand what you was drivin' at. I've seen men--good
1924,THE SAILOR:--,"workmen they was--try to do more than they could do, and--and they"
1925,THE SAILOR:--,"couldn't compass it. They knowed it, and it nigh broke their hearts"
1926,THE SAILOR:--,"like. You was in your right, o' course, sir, to say what you thought o'"
1927,THE SAILOR:--,"his work; but if you'll excuse me, was you in your duty?'"
1928,THE SAILOR:--,
1929,THE SAILOR:--,"'I was wrong to say it,' Hal replied. 'God forgive me--I was young! He"
1930,THE SAILOR:--,was workman enough himself to know where he failed. But it all came
1931,THE SAILOR:--,"evens in the long run. By the same token, did ye ever hear o' one"
1932,THE SAILOR:--,Torrigiano--Torrisany we called him?'
1933,THE SAILOR:--,
1934,THE SAILOR:--,'I can't say I ever did. Was he a Frenchy like?'
1935,THE SAILOR:--,
1936,THE SAILOR:--,"'No, a hectoring, hard-mouthed, long-sworded Italian builder, as vain as"
1937,THE SAILOR:--,"a peacock and as strong as a bull, but, mark you, a master workman. More"
1938,THE SAILOR:--,than that--he could get his best work out of the worst men.'
1939,THE SAILOR:--,
1940,THE SAILOR:--,"'Which it's a gift. I had a foreman-bricklayer like him once,' said Mr."
1941,THE SAILOR:--,"Springett. 'He used to prod 'em in the back like with a pointing-trowel,"
1942,THE SAILOR:--,and they did wonders.'
1943,THE SAILOR:--,
1944,THE SAILOR:--,'I've seen our Torrisany lay a 'prentice down with one buffet and raise
1945,THE SAILOR:--,him with another--to make a mason of him. I worked under him at building
1946,THE SAILOR:--,a chapel in London--a chapel and a tomb for the king.'
1947,THE SAILOR:--,
1948,THE SAILOR:--,"'I never knew kings went to chapel much,' said Mr. Springett. 'But I"
1949,THE SAILOR:--,"always hold with a man, don't care who he be, seein' about his own grave"
1950,THE SAILOR:--,before he dies. Tidn't the sort of thing to leave to your family after
1951,THE SAILOR:--,the will's read. I reckon 'twas a fine vault.'
1952,THE SAILOR:--,
1953,THE SAILOR:--,"'None finer in England. This Torrigiano had the contract for it, as"
1954,THE SAILOR:--,"you'd say. He picked master craftsmen from all parts--England, France,"
1955,THE SAILOR:--,"Italy, the Low Countries--no odds to him so long as they knew their"
1956,THE SAILOR:--,"work, and he drove them like--like pigs at Brightling Fair. He called us"
1957,THE SAILOR:--,English all pigs. We suffered it because he was a master in his craft.
1958,THE SAILOR:--,"If he misliked any work that a man had done, with his own great hands"
1959,THE SAILOR:--,"he'd rive it out, and tear it down before us all. ""Ah, you pig--you"
1960,THE SAILOR:--,"English pig!"" he'd scream in the dumb wretch's face. ""You answer me? You"
1961,THE SAILOR:--,look at me? You think at me? Come out with me into the cloisters. I will
1962,THE SAILOR:--,"teach you carving myself. I will gild you all over!"" But when his"
1963,THE SAILOR:--,"passion had blown out, he'd slip his arm round the man's neck, and"
1964,THE SAILOR:--,"impart knowledge worth gold. 'Twould have done your heart good, Mus'"
1965,THE SAILOR:--,"Springett, to see the two hundred of us--masons, jewellers, carvers,"
1966,THE SAILOR:--,"gilders, iron workers and the rest--all toiling like cock-angels, and"
1967,THE SAILOR:--,this mad Italian hornet fleeing from one to next up and down the chapel.
1968,THE SAILOR:--,"'Done your heart good, it would!'"
1969,THE SAILOR:--,
1970,THE SAILOR:--,"'I believe you,' said Mr. Springett. 'In Eighteen hundred Fifty-four, I"
1971,THE SAILOR:--,"mind, the railway was bein' made into Hastin's. There was two thousand"
1972,THE SAILOR:--,"navvies on it--all young--all strong--an' I was one of 'em. Oh, dearie"
1973,THE SAILOR:--,"me! Excuse me, sir, but was your enemy workin' with you?'"
1974,THE SAILOR:--,
1975,THE SAILOR:--,'Benedetto? Be sure he was. He followed me like a lover. He painted
1976,THE SAILOR:--,pictures on the chapel ceiling--slung from a chair. Torrigiano made us
1977,THE SAILOR:--,promise not to fight till the work should be finished. We were both
1978,THE SAILOR:--,"master craftsmen, do ye see, and he needed us. None the less, I never"
1979,THE SAILOR:--,went aloft to carve 'thout testing all my ropes and knots each morning.
1980,THE SAILOR:--,We were never far from each other. Benedetto 'ud sharpen his knife on
1981,THE SAILOR:--,"his sole while he waited for his plaster to dry--_wheet, wheet, wheet_."
1982,THE SAILOR:--,"I'd hear it where I hung chipping round a pillar-head, and we'd nod to"
1983,THE SAILOR:--,"each other friendly-like. Oh, he was a craftsman, was Benedetto, but his"
1984,THE SAILOR:--,hate spoiled his eye and his hand. I mind the night I had finished the
1985,THE SAILOR:--,models for the bronze saints round the tomb; Torrigiano embraced me
1986,THE SAILOR:--,"before all the chapel, and bade me to supper. I met Benedetto when I"
1987,THE SAILOR:--,came out. He was slavering in the porch like a mad dog.'
1988,THE SAILOR:--,
1989,THE SAILOR:--,'Working himself up to it?' said Mr. Springett. 'Did he have it in at ye
1990,THE SAILOR:--,that night?'
1991,THE SAILOR:--,
1992,THE SAILOR:--,"'No, no. That time he kept his oath to Torrigiano. But I pitied him. Eh,"
1993,THE SAILOR:--,well! Now I come to my own follies. I had never thought too little of
1994,THE SAILOR:--,"myself; but after Torrisany had put his arm round my neck, I--I'--Hal"
1995,THE SAILOR:--,broke into a laugh--'I lay there was not much odds 'twixt me and a
1996,THE SAILOR:--,cock-sparrow in his pride.'
1997,THE SAILOR:--,
1998,THE SAILOR:--,"'I was pretty middlin' young once on a time,' said Mr. Springett."
1999,THE SAILOR:--,
2000,THE SAILOR:--,"'Then ye know that a man can't drink and dice and dress fine, and keep"
2001,THE SAILOR:--,"company above his station, but his work suffers for it, Mus' Springett.'"
2002,THE SAILOR:--,
2003,THE SAILOR:--,"'I never held much with dressin' up, but--you're right! The worst"
2004,THE SAILOR:--,"mistakes _I_ ever made they was made on a Monday morning,' Mr."
2005,THE SAILOR:--,Springett answered. 'We've all been one sort of fool or t'other. Mus'
2006,THE SAILOR:--,"Dan, Mus' Dan, take the smallest gouge, or you'll be spluttin' her stern"
2007,THE SAILOR:--,works clean out. Can't ye see the grain of the wood don't favour a
2008,THE SAILOR:--,chisel?'
2009,THE SAILOR:--,
2010,THE SAILOR:--,'I'll spare you some of my follies. But there was a man called
2011,THE SAILOR:--,"Brygandyne--Bob Brygandyne--Clerk of the King's Ships, a little, smooth,"
2012,THE SAILOR:--,"bustling atomy, as clever as a woman to get work done for nothin'--a"
2013,THE SAILOR:--,"won'erful smooth-tongued pleader. He made much o' me, and asked me to"
2014,THE SAILOR:--,"draft him out a drawing, a piece of carved and gilt scroll-work for the"
2015,THE SAILOR:--,bows of one of the King's ships--the _Sovereign_ was her name.'
2016,THE SAILOR:--,
2017,THE SAILOR:--,'Was she a man-of-war?' asked Dan.
2018,THE SAILOR:--,
2019,THE SAILOR:--,"'She was a war-ship, and a woman called Catherine of Castile desired the"
2020,THE SAILOR:--,King to give her the ship for a pleasure-ship of her own. _I_ did not
2021,THE SAILOR:--,"know at the time, but she'd been at Bob to get this scroll-work done and"
2022,THE SAILOR:--,"fitted that the King might see it. I made him the picture, in an hour,"
2023,THE SAILOR:--,all of a heat after supper--one great heaving play of dolphins and a
2024,THE SAILOR:--,"Neptune or so reining in webby-footed sea-horses, and Arion with his"
2025,THE SAILOR:--,"harp high atop of them. It was twenty-three foot long, and maybe nine"
2026,THE SAILOR:--,foot deep--painted and gilt.'
2027,THE SAILOR:--,
2028,THE SAILOR:--,"'It must ha' just about looked fine,' said Mr. Springett."
2029,THE SAILOR:--,
2030,THE SAILOR:--,'That's the curiosity of it. 'Twas bad--rank bad. In my conceit I must
2031,THE SAILOR:--,"needs show it to Torrigiano, in the chapel. He straddles his legs;"
2032,THE SAILOR:--,"hunches his knife behind him, and whistles like a storm-cock through a"
2033,THE SAILOR:--,"sleet-shower. Benedetto was behind him. He were never far apart, I've"
2034,THE SAILOR:--,told you.
2035,THE SAILOR:--,
2036,THE SAILOR:--,"'""That is pig's work,"" says our Master. ""Swine's work. You make any more"

2039,THE SAILOR:--,
2040,THE SAILOR:--,"'Benedetto licks his lips like a cat. ""Is it so bad then, Master?"" he"
2041,THE SAILOR:--,"says. ""What a pity!"""
2042,THE SAILOR:--,
2043,THE SAILOR:--,"'""Yes,"" says Torrigiano. ""Scarcely _you_ could do things so bad. I will"
2044,THE SAILOR:--,"condescend to show."""
2045,THE SAILOR:--,
2046,THE SAILOR:--,"'He talks to me then and there. No shouting, no swearing (it was too bad"
2047,THE SAILOR:--,"for that); but good, memorable counsel, bitten in slowly. Then he sets"
2048,THE SAILOR:--,"me to draft out a pair of iron gates, to take, as he said, the taste of"
2049,THE SAILOR:--,my naughty dolphins out of my mouth. Iron's sweet stuff if you don't
2050,THE SAILOR:--,"torture her, and hammered work is all pure, truthful line, with a reason"
2051,THE SAILOR:--,and a support for every curve and bar of it. A week at that settled my
2052,THE SAILOR:--,"stomach handsomely, and the Master let me put the work through the"
2053,THE SAILOR:--,"smithy, where I sweated out more of my foolish pride.'"
2054,THE SAILOR:--,
2055,THE SAILOR:--,"'Good stuff is good iron,' said Mr. Springett. 'I done a pair of lodge"

2057,THE SAILOR:--,
2058,THE SAILOR:--,"'Oh, I forgot to say that Bob Brygandyne whipped away my draft of the"
2059,THE SAILOR:--,"ship's scroll-work, and would not give it back to me to re-draw. He said"
2060,THE SAILOR:--,"'twould do well enough. Howsoever, my lawful work kept me too busied to"
2061,THE SAILOR:--,"remember him. Body o' me, but I worked that winter upon the gates and"
2062,THE SAILOR:--,the bronzes for the tomb as I'd never worked before! I was leaner than a
2063,THE SAILOR:--,"lath, but I lived--I lived then!' Hal looked at Mr. Springett with his"
2064,THE SAILOR:--,"wise, crinkled-up eyes, and the old man smiled back."
2065,THE SAILOR:--,
2066,THE SAILOR:--,"'Ouch!' Dan cried. He had been hollowing out the schooner's after-deck,"
2067,THE SAILOR:--,"the little gouge had slipped and gashed the ball of his left thumb,--an"
2068,THE SAILOR:--,"ugly, triangular tear."
2069,THE SAILOR:--,
2070,THE SAILOR:--,"'That came of not steadying your wrist,' said Hal calmly. 'Don't bleed"
2071,THE SAILOR:--,"over the wood. _Do_ your work with your heart's blood, but no need to"
2072,THE SAILOR:--,let it show.' He rose and peered into a corner of the loft.
2073,THE SAILOR:--,
2074,THE SAILOR:--,"Mr. Springett had risen too, and swept down a ball of cobwebs from a"
2075,THE SAILOR:--,rafter.

2077,THE SAILOR:--,"'Clap that on,' was all he said, 'and put your handkerchief atop. 'Twill"
2078,THE SAILOR:--,"cake over in a minute. It don't hurt now, do it?'"
2079,THE SAILOR:--,
2080,THE SAILOR:--,"'No,' said Dan indignantly. 'You know it has happened lots of times."
2081,THE SAILOR:--,"I'll tie it up myself. Go on, sir.'"
2082,THE SAILOR:--,
2083,THE SAILOR:--,"'And it'll happen hundreds of times more,' said Hal with a friendly nod"
2084,THE SAILOR:--,as he sat down again. But he did not go on till Dan's hand was tied up
2085,THE SAILOR:--,properly. Then he said:
2086,THE SAILOR:--,
2087,THE SAILOR:--,'One dark December day--too dark to judge colour--we was all sitting and
2088,THE SAILOR:--,"talking round the fires in the chapel (you heard good talk there), when"
2089,THE SAILOR:--,"Bob Brygandyne bustles in and--""Hal, you're sent for,"" he squeals. I was"
2090,THE SAILOR:--,"at Torrigiano's feet on a pile of put-locks, as I might be here,"
2091,THE SAILOR:--,toasting a herring on my knife's point. 'Twas the one English thing our

2099,THE SAILOR:--,"'""Be sure your sins will find you out,"" says Torrigiano. ""Go with him"
2100,THE SAILOR:--,"and see."" As I followed Bob out I was aware of Benedetto, like a black"

2102,THE SAILOR:--,
2103,THE SAILOR:--,"'Bob hurries through the streets in the raw fog, slips into a doorway,"
2104,THE SAILOR:--,"up stairs, along passages, and at last thrusts me into a little cold"

2210,THE SAILOR:--,should say--because I'd saved him the money; his smile as though he'd
2211,THE SAILOR:--,won half France! I thought of my own silly pride and foolish
2212,THE SAILOR:--,expectations that some day he'd honour me as a master craftsman. I
2213,THE SAILOR:--,thought of the broken-tipped sword he'd found behind the hangings;
2214,THE SAILOR:--,"the dirt of the cold room, and his cold eye, wrapped up in his own"
2215,THE SAILOR:--,"concerns, scarcely resting on me. Then I remembered the solemn chapel"

2217,THE SAILOR:--,see?--the unreason of it all--the mad high humour of it all--took hold
2218,THE SAILOR:--,"on me till I sat me down on a dark stair-head in a passage, and laughed"

2229,THE SAILOR:--,crazed for the time.
2230,THE SAILOR:--,
2231,THE SAILOR:--,"'""Laugh,"" he said. ""Finish the laughter. I'll not cut ye short. Tell me"

2251,THE SAILOR:--,"art's one art, as I said. I bore Benedetto no malice. My spirits, d'you"

2260,THE SAILOR:--,
2261,THE SAILOR:--,"'""That is how I was honoured by the King,"" I said. ""They'll hang ye for"

2263,THE SAILOR:--,"they'll draw and quarter you; but you're too mad to care. Grant me,"
2264,THE SAILOR:--,"though, ye never heard a better tale."""
2265,THE SAILOR:--,
2266,THE SAILOR:--,"'He said nothing, but I felt him shake. My head on his chest shook; his"
2267,THE SAILOR:--,"right arm fell away, his left dropped the knife, and he leaned with both"
2268,THE SAILOR:--,hands on my shoulder--shaking--shaking! I turned me round. No need to
2269,THE SAILOR:--,put my foot on his knife. The man was speechless with laughter--honest
2270,THE SAILOR:--,craftsman's mirth. The first time I'd ever seen him laugh. You know the
2271,THE SAILOR:--,"mirth that cuts off the very breath, while ye stamp and snatch at the"

2273,THE SAILOR:--,
2274,THE SAILOR:--,"'When he began to roar and bay and whoop in the passage, I haled him out"

2279,THE SAILOR:--,"'Benedetto says to 'em, solemn as an owl: ""You have saved me thirty"

2282,THE SAILOR:--,"afterwards, because the old crust of hatred round his heart was broke up"

2284,THE SAILOR:--,
2285,THE SAILOR:--,"'""Hal,"" he cries, ""I forgive thee. Forgive me too, Hal. Oh, you English,"
2286,THE SAILOR:--,"you English! Did it gall thee, Hal, to see the rust on the dirty sword?"

2289,THE SAILOR:--,
2290,THE SAILOR:--,"'So we reeled back to the chapel, arms round each other's necks, and"

2303,THE SAILOR:--,
2304,THE SAILOR:--,"'""Ah!"" says the Master, shaking his finger. ""Benedetto, if you had"

2309,THE SAILOR:--,
2310,THE SAILOR:--,Mr. Springett sat quite still for some time after Hal had finished. Then
2311,THE SAILOR:--,he turned dark red; then he rocked to and fro; then he coughed and
2312,THE SAILOR:--,wheezed till the tears ran down his face. Dan knew by this that he was
2313,THE SAILOR:--,"laughing, but it surprised Hal at first."
2314,THE SAILOR:--,
2315,THE SAILOR:--,"'Excuse me, sir,' said Mr. Springett, 'but I was thinkin' of some"
2316,THE SAILOR:--,stables I built for a gentleman in Eighteen hundred Seventy-four. They
2317,THE SAILOR:--,was stables in blue brick--very particular work. Dunno as they weren't
2318,THE SAILOR:--,the best job which ever I'd done. But the gentleman's lady--she'd come
2319,THE SAILOR:--,"from Lunnon, new married--she was all for buildin' what she called a"
2320,THE SAILOR:--,haw-haw--what you an' me 'ud call a dik--right acrost his park. A
2321,THE SAILOR:--,"middlin' big job which I'd have had the contract of, for she spoke to me"
2322,THE SAILOR:--,in the library about it. But I told her there was a line o' springs
2323,THE SAILOR:--,"just where she wanted to dig her ditch, an' she'd flood the park if she"
2324,THE SAILOR:--,went on.'
2325,THE SAILOR:--,
2326,THE SAILOR:--,'Were there any springs at all?' said Hal.
2327,THE SAILOR:--,
2328,THE SAILOR:--,"'Bound to be springs everywhere if you dig deep enough, ain't there? But"
2329,THE SAILOR:--,what I said about the springs put her out o' conceit o' diggin'
2330,THE SAILOR:--,"haw-haws, an' she took an' built a white tile dairy instead. But when I"
2331,THE SAILOR:--,"sent in my last bill for the stables, the gentleman he paid it 'thout"
2332,THE SAILOR:--,"even lookin' at it, and I hadn't forgotten nothin', I do assure you."
2333,THE SAILOR:--,"More than that, he slips two five-pound notes into my hand in the"
2334,THE SAILOR:--,"library, an' ""Ralph,"" he says--he allers called me by name--""Ralph,"" he"
2335,THE SAILOR:--,"says, ""you've saved me a heap of expense an' trouble this autumn."" I"

2337,THE SAILOR:--,"digged acrost his park no more'n _I_ did, but I never said nothing. No"
2338,THE SAILOR:--,"more he didn't say nothing about my blue-brick stables, which was really"
2339,THE SAILOR:--,the best an' honestest piece o' work I'd done in quite a while. He give

2341,THE SAILOR:--,"reckon things are pretty much alike, all times, in all places.'"
2342,THE SAILOR:--,
2343,THE SAILOR:--,Hal and he laughed together. Dan couldn't quite understand what they
2344,THE SAILOR:--,"thought so funny, and went on with his work for some time without"
2345,THE SAILOR:--,speaking.
2346,THE SAILOR:--,
2347,THE SAILOR:--,"When he looked up, Mr. Springett, alone, was wiping his eyes with his"

2350,THE SAILOR:--,"'Bless me, Mus' Dan, I've been asleep,' he said. 'An' I've dreamed a"

2470,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"When Dan took up boat-building, Una coaxed Mrs. Vincey, the farmer's"
2471,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"wife at Little Lindens, to teach her to milk. Mrs. Vincey milks in the"
2472,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"pasture in summer, which is different from milking in the shed, because"
2473,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"the cows are not tied up, and until they know you they will not stand"
2474,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,still. After three weeks Una could milk _Red Cow_ or _Kitty Shorthorn_
2475,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"quite dry, without her wrists aching, and then she allowed Dan to look."
2476,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"But milking did not amuse him, and it was pleasanter for Una to be alone"
2477,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"in the quiet pastures with quiet-spoken Mrs. Vincey. So, evening after"
2478,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"evening, she slipped across to Little Lindens, took her stool from the"
2479,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"fern-clump beside the fallen oak, and went to work, her pail between her"
2480,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"knees, and her head pressed hard into the cow's flank. As often as not,"
2481,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Mrs. Vincey would be milking cross _Pansy_ at the other end of the
2482,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"pasture, and would not come near till it was time to strain and pour"
2483,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,off.
2484,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2485,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Once, in the middle of a milking, _Kitty Shorthorn_ boxed Una's ear with"
2486,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,her tail.
2487,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2488,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'You old pig!' said Una, nearly crying, for a cow's tail can hurt."
2489,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2490,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Why didn't you tie it down, child?' said a voice behind her."
2491,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2492,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I meant to, but the flies are so bad I let her off--and this is what"
2493,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"she's done!' Una looked round, expecting Puck, and saw a curly-haired"
2494,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"girl, not much taller than herself, but older, dressed in a curious"
2495,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"high-waisted, lavender-coloured riding-habit, with a high hunched collar"
2496,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,and a deep cape and a belt fastened with a steel clasp. She wore a
2497,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"yellow velvet cap and tan gauntlets, and carried a real hunting-crop."
2498,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Her cheeks were pale except for two pretty pink patches in the middle,"
2499,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"and she talked with little gasps at the end of her sentences, as though"
2500,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,she had been running.
2501,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2502,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'You don't milk so badly, child,' she said, and when she smiled her"
2503,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,teeth showed small and even and pearly.
2504,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2505,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Can you milk?' Una asked, and then flushed, for she heard Puck's"
2506,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,chuckle.
2507,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2508,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"He stepped out of the fern and sat down, holding _Kitty Shorthorn's_"
2509,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"tail. 'There isn't much,' he said, 'that Miss Philadelphia doesn't know"
2510,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"about milk--or, for that matter, butter and eggs. She's a great"
2511,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,housewife.'
2512,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2513,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Oh,' said Una. 'I'm sorry I can't shake hands. Mine are all milky; but"
2514,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Mrs. Vincey is going to teach me butter-making this summer.'
2515,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2516,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Ah! _I_'m going to London this summer,' the girl said, 'to my aunt in"
2517,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Bloomsbury.' She coughed as she began to hum, '""Oh, what a town! What a"
2518,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"wonderful metropolis!""'"
2519,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2520,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'You've got a cold,' said Una."
2521,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2522,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'No. Only my stupid cough. But it's vastly better than it was last
2523,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,winter. It will disappear in London air. Every one says so. D'you like
2524,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"doctors, child?'"
2525,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2526,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I don't know any,' Una replied. 'But I'm sure I shouldn't.'"
2527,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2528,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Think yourself lucky, child. I beg your pardon,' the girl laughed, for"
2529,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Una frowned.
2530,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2531,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I'm not a child, and my name's Una,' she said."
2532,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2533,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Mine's Philadelphia. But everybody except Ren√© calls me Phil. I'm
2534,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Squire Bucksteed's daughter--over at Marklake yonder.' She jerked her
2535,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,little round chin towards the south behind Dallington. 'Sure-ly you know
2536,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Marklake?'
2537,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2538,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'We went a picnic to Marklake Green once,' said Una. 'It's awfully"
2539,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,pretty. I like all those funny little roads that don't lead anywhere.'
2540,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2541,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'They lead over our land,' said Philadelphia stiffly, 'and the coach"
2542,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,road is only four miles away. One can go anywhere from the Green. I went
2543,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,to the Assize Ball at Lewes last year.' She spun round and took a few
2544,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"dancing steps, but stopped with her hand to her side."
2545,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2546,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'It gives me a stitch,' she explained. 'No odds. 'Twill go away in"
2547,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"London air. That's the latest French step, child. Ren√© taught it me."
2548,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"D'you hate the French, chi--Una?'"
2549,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2550,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Well, I hate French, of course, but I don't mind Mam'selle. She's"
2551,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,rather decent. Is Ren√© your French governess?'
2552,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2553,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Philadelphia laughed till she caught her breath again.
2554,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2555,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Oh no! Ren√©'s a French prisoner--on parole. That means he's promised
2556,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,not to escape till he has been properly exchanged for an Englishman.
2557,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"He's only a doctor, so I hope they won't think him worth exchanging. My"
2558,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Uncle captured him last year in the _Ferdinand_ privateer, off Belle"
2559,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Isle, and he cured my Uncle of a r-r-raging toothache. Of course, after"
2560,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"_that_ we couldn't let him lie among the common French prisoners at Rye,"
2561,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"and so he stays with us. He's of very old family--a Breton, which is"
2562,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"nearly next door to being a true Briton, my father says--and he wears"
2563,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"his hair clubbed--not powdered. _Much_ more becoming, don't you think?'"
2564,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2565,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I don't know what you're----' Una began, but Puck, the other side of"
2566,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"the pail, winked, and she went on with her milking."
2567,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2568,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'He's going to be a great French physician when the war is over. He
2569,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,makes me bobbins for my lace-pillow now--he's very clever with his
2570,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,hands; but he'd doctor our people on the Green if they would let him.
2571,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Only our Doctor--Dr. Break--says he's an emp----or imp something--worse
2572,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,than impostor. But my Nurse says----'
2573,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2574,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Nurse! You're ever so old. What have you got a nurse for?' Una finished
2575,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"milking, and turned round on her stool as _Kitty Shorthorn_ grazed off."
2576,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2577,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Because I can't get rid of her. Old Cissie nursed my mother, and she"
2578,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,says she'll nurse me till she dies. The idea! She never lets me alone.
2579,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"She thinks I'm delicate. She has grown infirm in her understanding, you"
2580,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"know. Mad--quite mad, poor Cissie!'"
2581,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2582,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Really mad?' said Una. 'Or just silly?'
2583,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2584,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Crazy I should say--from the things she does. Her devotion to me is
2585,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,terribly embarrassing. You know I have all the keys of the Hall except
2586,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,the brewery and the tenants' kitchen. I give out all stores and the
2587,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,linen and plate.'
2588,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2589,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'How jolly! I love store-rooms and giving out things.'
2590,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2591,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Ah, it's a great responsibility you'll find when you come to my age."
2592,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Last year Dad said I was fatiguing myself with my duties, and he"
2593,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"actually wanted me to give up the keys to old Amoore, our housekeeper. I"
2594,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"wouldn't. I hate her. I said, ""No, sir. I am Mistress of Marklake Hall"
2595,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"just as long as I live, because I'm never going to be married, and I"
2596,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"shall give out stores and linen till I die!""'"
2597,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2598,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'And what did your father say?'
2599,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2600,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Oh, I threatened to pin a dishclout to his coattail. He ran away. Every"
2601,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"one's afraid of Dad, except me.' Philadelphia stamped her foot. 'The"
2602,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"idea! If I can't make my own father happy in his own house, I'd like to"
2603,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"meet the woman that can, and--and--I'd have the living hide off her!'"
2604,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2605,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,She cut with her long-thonged whip. It cracked like a pistol-shot across
2606,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,the still pasture. _Kitty Shorthorn_ threw up her head and trotted away.
2607,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2608,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I beg your pardon,' Philadelphia said; 'but it makes me furious. Don't"
2609,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"you hate those ridiculous old quizzes with their feathers and fronts,"
2610,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"who come to dinner and call you ""child"" in your own chair at your own"

2612,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2613,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I don't always come to dinner,' said Una, 'but I hate being called"
2614,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"""child."" Please tell me about store-rooms and giving out things.'"
2615,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2616,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Ah, it's a great responsibility--particularly with that old cat Amoore"
2617,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,looking at the lists over your shoulder. And such a shocking thing
2618,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"happened last summer! Poor crazy Cissie, my Nurse that I was telling you"
2619,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"of, she took three solid silver tablespoons.'"
2620,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2621,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Took! But isn't that stealing?' Una cried.
2622,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2623,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Hsh!' said Philadelphia, looking round at Puck. 'All I say is she took"
2624,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"them without my leave. I made it right afterwards. So, as Dad says--and"
2625,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,he's a magistrate--it wasn't a legal offence; it was only compounding a
2626,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,felony.'
2627,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2628,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'It sounds awful,' said Una."
2629,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2630,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'It was. My dear, I was furious! I had had the keys for ten months, and"
2631,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"I'd never lost anything before. I said nothing at first, because a big"
2632,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"house offers so many chances of things being mislaid, and coming to hand"
2633,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"later. ""Fetching up in the lee-scuppers,"" my Uncle calls it. But next"
2634,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"week I spoke to old Cissie about it when she was doing my hair at night,"
2635,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,and she said I wasn't to worry my heart for trifles!'
2636,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2637,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Isn't it like 'em?' Una burst out. 'They see you're worried over
2638,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"something that really matters, and they say, ""Don't worry""; as if _that_"
2639,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,did any good!'
2640,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2641,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I quite agree with you, my dear; quite agree with you! I told Ciss the"
2642,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"spoons were solid silver, and worth forty shillings, so if the thief"
2643,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"were found, he'd be tried for his life.'"
2644,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2645,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Hanged, do you mean?' Una said."
2646,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2647,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'They ought to be; but Dad says no jury will hang a man nowadays for a
2648,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,forty-shilling theft. They transport 'em into penal servitude at the
2649,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"uttermost ends of the earth beyond the seas, for the term of their"
2650,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"natural life. I told Cissie that, and I saw her tremble in my mirror."
2651,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Then she cried, and caught hold of my knees, and I couldn't for my life"
2652,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"understand what it was all about,--she cried so. _Can_ you guess, my"
2653,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"dear, what that poor crazy thing had done? It was midnight before I"
2654,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"pieced it together. She had given the spoons to Jerry Gamm, the"
2655,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Witchmaster on the Green, so that he might put a charm on me! Me!'"
2656,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2657,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Put a charm on you? Why?'
2658,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2659,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'That's what _I_ asked; and then I saw how mad poor Cissie was! You know
2660,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,this stupid little cough of mine? It will disappear as soon as I go to
2661,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"London. She was troubled about _that_, and about my being so thin, and"
2662,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"she told me Jerry had promised her, if she would bring him three silver"
2663,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"spoons, that he'd charm my cough away and make me plump--""flesh-up,"" she"
2664,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,said. I couldn't help laughing; but it was a terrible night! I had to
2665,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"put Cissie into my own bed, and stroke her hand till she cried herself"
2666,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"to sleep. What else could I have done? When she woke, and I coughed--I"
2667,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,suppose I _can_ cough in my own room if I please--she said that she'd
2668,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"killed me, and asked me to have her hanged at Lewes sooner than send her"
2669,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,to the uttermost ends of the earth away from me.'
2670,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2671,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'How awful! What did you do, Phil?'"
2672,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2673,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Do? I rode off at five in the morning to talk to Master Jerry, with a"
2674,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"new lash on my whip. Oh, I was _furious_! Witchmaster or no"
2675,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"witchmaster, I meant to----'"
2676,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2677,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Ah! what's a Witchmaster?'
2678,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2679,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'A master of witches, of course. _I_ don't believe there are witches;"
2680,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"but people say every village has a few, and Jerry was the master of all"
2681,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"ours at Marklake. He has been a smuggler, and a man-of-war's man, and"
2682,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,now he pretends to be a carpenter and joiner--he can make almost
2683,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,anything--but he really is a white wizard. He cures people by herbs and
2684,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"charms. He can cure them after Dr. Break has given them up, and that's"
2685,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"why Dr. Break hates him so. He used to make me toy carts, and charm off"
2686,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,my warts when I was a child.' Philadelphia spread out her hands with the
2687,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,delicate shiny little nails. 'It isn't counted lucky to cross him. He
2688,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"has his ways of getting even with you, they say. But _I_ wasn't afraid"
2689,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"of Jerry! I saw him working in his garden, and I leaned out of my saddle"
2690,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"and double-thonged him between the shoulders, over the hedge. Well, my"
2691,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"dear, for the first time since Dad gave him to me, my _Troubadour_ (I"
2692,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"wish you could see the sweet creature!) shied across the road, and I"
2693,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,spilled out into the hedge-top. _Most_ undignified! Jerry pulled me
2694,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,through to his side and brushed the leaves off me. I was horribly
2695,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"pricked, but I didn't care. ""Now, Jerry,"" I said, ""I'm going to take the"
2696,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"hide off you first, and send you to Lewes afterwards. You well know"
2697,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"why."" ""Oh!"" he said, and he sat down among his bee-hives. ""Then I reckon"
2698,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"you've come about old Cissie's business, my dear."" ""I reckon I just"
2699,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"about have,"" I said. ""Stand away from these hives. I can't get at you"
2700,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"there."" ""That's why I be where I be,"" he said. ""If you'll excuse me,"
2701,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Miss Phil, I don't hold with bein' flogged before breakfast, at my time"
2702,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"o' life."" He's a huge big man, but he looked so comical squatting among"
2703,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"the hives that--I know I oughtn't to--I laughed, and he laughed. I"
2704,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"always laugh at the wrong time. But I soon recovered my dignity, and I"
2705,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"said, ""Then give me back what you made poor Cissie steal!"""
2706,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2707,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'""Your pore Cissie,"" he said. ""She's a hatful o' trouble. But you shall"
2708,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"have 'em, Miss Phil. They're all ready put by for you."" And, would you"
2709,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"believe it, the old sinner pulled my three silver spoons out of his"
2710,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"dirty pocket, and polished them on his cuff! ""Here they be,"" he says,"

2785,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'What nonsense! I told Ren√© about it, of course, because he's a doctor."
2786,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,He's going to be a most famous doctor. That's why our doctor hates him.
2787,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Ren√© said, ""Oho! Your Master Gamm, he is worth knowing,"" and he put up"
2788,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,his eyebrows--like this. He made joke of it all. He can see my window
2789,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"from the carpenter's shed, where he works, and if ever the maple stick"
2790,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"fell down, he pretended to be in a fearful taking till I propped the"
2791,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,window up again. He used to ask me whether I had said my Apostles
2792,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"properly, and how I took my deep breaths. Oh yes, and the next day,"
2793,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"though he had been there ever so many times before, he put on his new"
2794,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,hat and paid Jerry Gamm a visit of state--as a fellow-physician. Jerry
2795,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"never guessed Ren√© was making fun of him, and so he told Ren√© about the"
2796,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"sick people in the village, and how he cured them with herbs after Dr."
2797,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Break had given them up. Jerry could talk smugglers' French, of course,"
2798,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"and I had taught Ren√© plenty of English, if only he wasn't so shy. They"
2799,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"called each other Monsieur Gamm and Mosheur Lanark, just like gentlemen."
2800,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"I suppose it amused poor Ren√©. He hasn't much to do, except to fiddle"
2801,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,about in the carpenter's shop. He's like all the French
2802,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,prisoners--always making knick-knacks; and Jerry had a little lathe at
2803,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"his cottage, and so--and so--Ren√© took to being with Jerry much more"
2804,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"than I approved of. The Hall is so big and empty when Dad's away, and I"
2805,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,will _not_ sit with old Amoore--she talks so horridly about every

2807,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2808,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I was rude to Ren√©, I'm afraid; but I was properly served out for it."
2809,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,One always is. You see Dad went down to Hastings to pay his respects to
2810,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"the General who commanded the brigade there, and to bring him to the"
2811,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Hall afterwards. Dad told me he was a very brave soldier from India--he
2812,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"was Colonel of Dad's regiment, the Thirty-third Foot, after Dad left the"
2813,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Army, and then he changed his name from Wesley to Wellesley, or else the"
2814,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"other way about; and Dad said I was to get out all the silver for him,"
2815,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,and I knew that meant a big dinner. So I sent down to the sea for early
2816,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"mackerel, and had _such_ a morning in the kitchen and the store-rooms."
2817,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Old Amoore nearly cried.
2818,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2819,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'However, my dear, I made all my preparations in ample time, but the"
2820,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,fish didn't arrive--it never does--and I wanted Ren√© to ride to Pevensey
2821,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"and bring it himself. He had gone over to Jerry, of course, as he always"
2822,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"used, unless I requested his presence beforehand. _I_ can't send for"
2823,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Ren√© every time I want him. He should be there. Now, don't you ever do"
2824,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"what I did, child, because it's in the highest degree unladylike;"
2825,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"but--but one of our woods runs up to Jerry's garden, and if you"

2827,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,hollow oak just above the pigsty where you can hear and see everything

2829,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,saw him and Jerry sitting on the seat playing with wooden toy trumpets.
2830,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"So I slipped into the hollow, and choked down my cough, and listened."
2831,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,Ren√© had never shown _me_ any of these trumpets.'
2832,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,

2834,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2835,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'They weren't real trumpets, because Jerry opened his shirt collar, and"
2836,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Ren√© put one end of his trumpet against Jerry's chest, and put his ear"

2838,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,listened while Ren√© breathed and coughed. I was afraid _I_ would cough

2851,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
2852,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Jerry talked for nearly a quarter of an hour about sick people in the

2997,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"spoke in a simply dreadful voice, my dear, and Dr. Break turned quite"

2999,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,and choked him black.
3000,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3001,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Well, my dear, as if this wasn't deliciously exciting enough, just"
3002,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,exactly at that minute I heard a strange voice on the other side of the

3005,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Ren√© kneeling on Dr. Break, and there was I up in the oak, listening"

3007,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3008,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I must have leaned forward too much, and the voice gave me such a start"

3011,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"bounced down into the garden, just behind Jerry, with my hair full of"

3013,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3014,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Oh, I can!' Una laughed till she nearly fell off the stool."

3016,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Dad said, ""Phil--a--del--phia!"" and Sir Arthur Wesley said, ""Good Ged!"""
3017,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,and Jerry put his foot on the pistol Ren√© had dropped. But Ren√© was

3055,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"and the pearl knots, you know, catching up the drapery from the left"

3076,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"that Sir Arthur only commanded a brigade at Hastings, and he told Dad of"
3077,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,a battle in India at a place called Assaye. Dad said it was a terrible

3106,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3107,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I've a deep voice for my age and size,' she explained. 'Contralto, you"

3111,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'I have given my heart to a flower,"

3115,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3116,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Isn't that touchingly sweet? Then the last verse--I wish I had my harp,"

3120,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Ye desolate whirlwinds that rave,"

3124,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3125,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'Beautiful!' said Una. 'And did they like it?'
3126,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3127,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Like it? They were overwhelmed--_accabl√©s_, as Ren√© says. My dear, if I"

3129,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"tears, genuine tears, to the eyes of four grown men. But I did! Ren√©"
3130,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,simply couldn't endure it! He's all French sensibility. He hid his face
3131,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"and said, ""_Assez Mademoiselle! C'est plus fort que moi! Assez!_"" And"
3132,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Sir Arthur blew his nose and said, ""Good Ged! This is worse than"
3133,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"Assaye!"" While Dad sat with the tears simply running down his cheeks.'"
3134,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3135,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,'And what did Dr. Break do?'
3136,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3137,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'He got up and pretended to look out of the window, but I saw his little"

3140,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3141,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Oh, I wish I'd seen! I wish I'd been you,' said Una, clasping her"

3148,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3149,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'It didn't matter,' said Una; 'I just waited. Is that old _Pansy_"
3150,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,barging about the lower pasture now?'
3151,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3152,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'No,' said Mrs. Vincey, listening. 'It sounds more like a horse being"
3153,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,galloped middlin' quick through the woods; but there's no road there. I
3154,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,reckon it's one of Gleason's colts loose. Shall I see you up to the

3156,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,
3157,THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS,"'Gracious no! thank you. What's going to hurt me?' said Una, and she put"

3250,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The children went to the seaside for a month, and lived in a flint"
3251,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"village on the bare windy chalk Downs, quite thirty miles away from"
3252,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"home. They made friends with an old shepherd, called Mr. Dudeney, who"
3253,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,had known their father when their father was little. He did not talk
3254,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"like their own people in the Weald of Sussex, and he used different"
3255,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"names for farm things, but he understood how they felt, and let them go"
3256,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"with him. He had a tiny cottage about half a mile from the village,"
3257,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"where his wife made mead from thyme honey, and nursed sick lambs in"
3258,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"front of a coal fire, while Old Jim, who was Mr. Dudeney's sheep-dog's"
3259,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"father, lay at the door. They brought up beef bones for Old Jim (you"

3261,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"to be far in the Downs, Mrs. Dudeney would tell the dog to take them to"

3263,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3264,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,One August afternoon when the village water-cart had made the street
3265,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"smell specially townified, they went to look for their shepherd as"

3269,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3270,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'It's just like the sea,' said Una, when Old Jim halted in the shade of"
3271,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"a lonely flint barn on a bare rise. 'You see where you're going,"
3272,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"and--you go there, and there's nothing between.'"
3273,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3274,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Dan slipped off his shoes. 'When we get home I shall sit in the woods
3275,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"all day,' he said."
3276,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3277,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Whuff!' said Old Jim, to show he was ready, and struck across a long"
3278,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,rolling stretch of turf. Presently he asked for his beef bone.
3279,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3280,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Not yet,' said Dan. 'Where's Mr. Dudeney? Where's master?'"
3281,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3282,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Old Jim looked as if he thought they were mad, and asked again."
3283,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3284,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Don't you give it him,' Una cried. 'I'm not going to be left howling in"

3286,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3287,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Show, boy! Show!' said Dan, for the Downs seemed as bare as the palm of"
3288,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,your hand.
3289,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3290,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Old Jim sighed, and trotted forward. Soon they spied the blob of Mr."
3291,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Dudeney's hat against the sky a long way off.
3292,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3293,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Right! All right!' said Dan. Old Jim wheeled round, took his bone"
3294,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"carefully between his blunted teeth, and returned to the shadow of the"
3295,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"old barn, looking just like a wolf. The children went on. Two kestrels"
3296,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,hung bivvering and squealing above them. A gull flapped lazily along the
3297,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,white edge of the cliffs. The curves of the Downs shook a little in the

3299,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3300,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,They walked toward it very slowly and found themselves staring into a
3301,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"horse-shoe-shaped hollow a hundred feet deep, whose steep sides were"
3302,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,laced with tangled sheep-tracks. The flock grazed on the flat at the
3303,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"bottom, under charge of Young Jim. Mr. Dudeney sat comfortably knitting"
3304,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"on the edge of the slope, his crook between his knees. They told him"
3305,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,what Old Jim had done.
3306,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3307,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Ah, he thought you could see my head as soon as he did. The closeter"

3316,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3317,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'We don't want to sleep,' said Una indignantly; but she settled herself"

3319,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3320,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'O' course not. You come to talk with me same as your father used. _He_
3321,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,didn't need no dog to guide him to Norton Pit.'
3322,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3323,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Well, he belonged here,' said Dan, and laid himself down at length on"
3324,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the turf.
3325,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3326,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'He did. And what beats me is why he went off to live among them messy
3327,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"trees in the Weald, when he might ha' stayed here and looked all about"
3328,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"him. There's no profit to trees. They draw the lightning, and sheep"
3329,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"shelter under 'em, and _so_, like as not, you'll lose a half score ewes"
3330,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,struck dead in one storm. Tck! Your father knew that.'
3331,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3332,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Trees aren't messy.' Una rose on her elbow. 'And what about firewood? I
3333,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,don't like coal.'
3334,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3335,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Eh? You lie a piece more up-hill and you'll lie more natural,' said"
3336,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Mr. Dudeney, with his provoking deaf smile. 'Now press your face down"
3337,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,and smell to the turf. That's Southdown thyme which makes our Southdown
3338,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"mutton beyond compare, and, my mother told me, 'twill cure anything"
3339,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"except broken necks, or hearts. I forget which.'"
3340,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3341,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"They sniffed, and somehow forgot to lift their cheeks from the soft"
3342,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,thymy cushions.
3343,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3344,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'You don't get nothing like that in the Weald. Watercress, maybe?' said"
3345,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Mr. Dudeney.
3346,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3347,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'But we've water--brooks full of it--where you paddle in hot weather,'"
3348,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Una replied, watching a yellow-and-violet-banded snail-shell close to"
3349,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,her eye.
3350,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3351,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Brooks flood. Then you must shift your sheep--let alone foot-rot
3352,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,afterward. I put more dependence on a dew-pond any day.'
3353,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3354,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'How's a dew-pond made?' said Dan, and tilted his hat over his eyes. Mr."
3355,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Dudeney explained.
3356,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3357,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,The air trembled a little as though it could not make up its mind
3358,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,whether to slide into the Pit or move across the open. But it seemed
3359,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"easiest to go down-hill, and the children felt one soft puff after"
3360,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,another slip and sidle down the slope in fragrant breaths that baffed on
3361,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,their eyelids. The little whisper of the sea by the cliffs joined with
3362,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the whisper of the wind over the grass, the hum of insects in the thyme,"
3363,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the ruffle and rustle of the flock below, and a thickish mutter deep in"
3364,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the very chalk beneath them. Mr. Dudeney stopped explaining, and went on"
3365,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,with his knitting.
3366,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3367,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,They were roused by voices. The shadow had crept half-way down the steep
3368,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"side of Norton's Pit, and on the edge of it, his back to them, Puck sat"
3369,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,beside a half-naked man who seemed busy at some work. The wind had
3370,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"dropped, and in that funnel of ground every least noise and movement"
3371,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,reached them like whispers up a water-pipe.
3372,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3373,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'That is clever,' said Puck, leaning over. 'How truly you shape it!'"
3374,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3375,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Yes, but what does The Beast care for a brittle flint tip? Bah!' The"
3376,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,man flicked something contemptuously over his shoulder. It fell between
3377,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Dan and Una--a beautiful dark-blue flint arrow-head still hot from the
3378,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,maker's hand.
3379,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3380,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The man reached for another stone, and worked away like a thrush with a"
3381,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,snail-shell.
3382,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3383,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Flint work is fool's work,' he said at last. 'One does it because one"
3384,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"always did it, but when it comes to dealing with The Beast--no good!' He"
3385,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,shook his shaggy head.
3386,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3387,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'The Beast was dealt with long ago. He has gone,' said Puck."
3388,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3389,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'He'll be back at lambing-time. _I_ know him.' He chipped very
3390,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"carefully, and the flints squeaked."
3391,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3392,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Not he. Children can lie out on the Chalk now all day through and go
3393,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,home safe.'
3394,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3395,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Can they? Well, call The Beast by his True Name, and I'll believe it,'"
3396,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the man replied.
3397,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3398,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Surely!' Puck leaped to his feet, curved his hands round his mouth and"
3399,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"shouted: ""Wolf! Wolf!"""
3400,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3401,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Norton's Pit threw back the echo from its dry sides--'Wuff! Wuff!' like
3402,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Young Jim's bark.
3403,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3404,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'You see? You hear?' said Puck. 'Nobody answers. Grey Shepherd is gone.
3405,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Feet-in-the-Night has run off. There are no more wolves.'
3406,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3407,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Wonderful!' The man wiped his forehead as though he were hot. 'Who
3408,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,drove him away? You?'
3409,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3410,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Many men through many years, each working in his own country. Were you"
3411,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,one of them?' Puck answered.
3412,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3413,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The man slid his sheepskin cloak to his waist, and without a word"
3414,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"pointed to his side, which was all seamed and blotched with scars. His"
3415,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,arms too were dimpled from shoulder to elbow with horrible white
3416,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,dimples.
3417,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3418,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I see,' said Puck. 'It is The Beast's mark. What did you use against"
3419,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,him?'
3420,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3421,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Hand, hammer, and spear, as our fathers did before us.'"
3422,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3423,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'So? Then how'--Puck twitched aside the man's dark-brown cloak--'how did
3424,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"a Flint-worker come by _that_? Show, man, show!' He held out his little"
3425,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,hand.
3426,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3427,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The man slipped a long dark iron knife, almost a short sword, from his"
3428,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"belt, and after breathing on it, handed it hilt-first to Puck, who took"
3429,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"it with his head on one side, as you should when you look at the works"
3430,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"of a watch, squinted down the dark blade, and very delicately rubbed his"
3431,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,forefinger from the point to the hilt.
3432,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3433,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Good!' said he, in a surprised tone."
3434,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3435,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'It should be. The Children of the Night made it,' the man answered."
3436,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3437,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'So I see by the iron. What might it have cost you?'
3438,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3439,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'This!' The man raised his hand to his cheek. Puck whistled like a Weald
3440,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,starling.
3441,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3442,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'By the Great Rings of the Chalk!' he cried. 'Was _that_ your price?
3443,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Turn sunward that I may see better, and shut your eye.'"
3444,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3445,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,He slipped his hand beneath the man's chin and swung him till he faced
3446,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the children up the slope. They saw that his right eye was gone, and the"
3447,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"eyelid lay shrunk. Quickly Puck turned him round again, and the two sat"
3448,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,down.
3449,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3450,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'It was for the sheep. The sheep are the people,' said the man, in an"
3451,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"ashamed voice. 'What else could I have done? _You_ know, Old One.'"
3452,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3453,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Puck sighed a little fluttering sigh. 'Take the knife. I listen.'
3454,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3455,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The man bowed his head, drove the knife into the turf, and while it"
3456,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,still quivered said: 'This is witness between us that I speak the thing
3457,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,that has been. Before my Knife and the Naked Chalk I speak. Touch!'
3458,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3459,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Puck laid a hand on the hilt. It stopped shaking. The children wriggled
3460,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,a little nearer.
3461,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3462,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I am of the People of the Worked Flint. I am the one son of the
3463,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Priestess who sells the Winds to the Men of the Sea. I am the Buyer of
3464,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the Knife--the Keeper of the People,' the man began, in a sort of"
3465,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"singing shout. 'These are my names in this country of the Naked Chalk,"
3466,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,between the Trees and the Sea.'
3467,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3468,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Yours was a great country. Your names are great too,' said Puck."
3469,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3470,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'One cannot feed some things on names and songs'; the man hit himself on
3471,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the chest. 'It is better--always better--to count one's children safe
3472,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"round the fire, their Mother among them.'"
3473,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3474,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Ahai!' said Puck. 'I think this will be a very old tale.'
3475,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3476,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I warm myself and eat at any fire that I choose, but there is no _one_"
3477,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,to light me a fire or cook my meat. I sold all that when I bought the
3478,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Magic Knife for my people. It was not right that The Beast should master
3479,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,man. What else could I have done?'
3480,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3481,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I hear. I know. I listen,' said Puck."
3482,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3483,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'When I was old enough to take my place in the Sheepguard, The Beast"
3484,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,gnawed all our country like a bone between his teeth. He came in behind
3485,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the flocks at watering-time, and watched them round the Dew-ponds; he"
3486,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,leaped into the folds between our knees at the shearing; he walked out
3487,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"alongside the grazing flocks, and chose his meat on the hoof while our"
3488,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"boys threw flints at him; he crept by night into the huts, and licked"
3489,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the babe from between the mother's hands; he called his companions and
3490,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,pulled down men in broad daylight on the Naked Chalk. No--not always did
3491,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,he do so! _This_ was his cunning! He would go away for a while to let us
3492,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"forget him. A year--two years perhaps--we neither smelt, nor heard, nor"
3493,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,saw him. When our flocks had increased; when our men did not always look
3494,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,behind them; when children strayed from the fenced places; when our
3495,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"women walked alone to draw water--back, back, back came the Curse of the"
3496,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Chalk, Grey Shepherd, Feet-in-the Night--The Beast, The Beast, The"
3497,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Beast!
3498,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3499,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'He laughed at our little brittle arrows and our poor blunt spears. He
3500,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,learned to run in under the stroke of the hammer. I think he knew when
3501,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,there was a flaw in the flint. Often it does not show till you bring it
3502,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"down on his snout. Then--_Pouf!_--the false flint falls all to flinders,"
3503,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"and you are left with the hammer-handle in your fist, and his teeth in"
3504,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"your flank! I have felt them. At evening, too, in the dew, or when it"
3505,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"has misted and rained, your spear-head lashings slack off, though you"
3506,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,have kept them beneath your cloak all day. You are alone--but so close
3507,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"to the home ponds that you stop to tighten the sinews with hands, teeth,"
3508,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,and a piece of driftwood. You bend over and pull--so! That is the minute
3509,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"for which he has followed you since the stars went out. ""Aarh!"" he says."
3510,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"""Wurr-aarh!"" he says.' (Norton's Pit gave back the growl like a pack of"
3511,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,real wolves.) 'Then he is on your right shoulder feeling for the vein in
3512,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"your neck, and--perhaps your sheep run on without you. To fight The"
3513,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Beast is nothing, but to be despised by The Beast when he fights"
3514,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"you--that is like his teeth in the heart! Old One, why is it that men"
3515,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"desire so greatly, and can do so little?'"
3516,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3517,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I do not know. Did you desire so much?' said Puck.
3518,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3519,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I desired to master The Beast. It is not right that The Beast should
3520,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"master man. But my people were afraid. Even my Mother, the Priestess,"
3521,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,was afraid when I told her what I desired. We were accustomed to be
3522,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"afraid of The Beast. When I was made a man, and a maiden--she was a"
3523,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Priestess--waited for me at the Dew-ponds, The Beast flitted from off"
3524,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the Chalk. Perhaps it was a sickness; perhaps he had gone to his Gods to
3525,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"learn how to do us new harm. But he went, and we breathed more freely."
3526,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,The women sang again; the children were not so much guarded; our flocks
3527,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,grazed far out. I took mine yonder'--he pointed inland to the hazy line
3528,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,of the Weald--'where the new grass was best. They grazed north. I
3529,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,followed till we were close to the Trees'--he lowered his voice--'close
3530,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"_there_ where the Children of the Night live,' He pointed north again."
3531,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3532,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Ah, now I remember a thing,' said Puck. 'Tell me, why did your people"
3533,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,fear the Trees so extremely?'
3534,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3535,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Because the Gods hate the Trees and strike them with lightning. We can
3536,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"see them burning for days all along the Chalk's edge. Besides, all the"
3537,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Chalk knows that the Children of the Night, though they worship our"
3538,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Gods, are magicians. When a man goes into their country, they change his"
3539,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,spirit; they put words into his mouth; they make him like talking water.
3540,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,But a voice in my heart told me to go toward the north. While I watched
3541,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"my sheep there I saw three Beasts chasing a man, who ran toward the"
3542,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Trees. By this I knew he was a Child of the Night. We Flint-workers fear
3543,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the Trees more than we fear The Beast. He had no hammer; he carried a
3544,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,knife like this one. A Beast leaped at him. He stretched out his knife.
3545,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The Beast fell dead. The other Beasts ran away howling, which they would"
3546,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,never have done from a Flint-worker. The man went in among the Trees. I
3547,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,looked for the dead Beast. He had been killed in a new way--by a single
3548,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"deep, clean cut, without bruise or tear, which had split his bad heart."
3549,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Wonderful! So I saw that the man's knife was magic, and I thought how to"
3550,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"get it,--thought strongly how to get it."
3551,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3552,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'When I brought the flocks to the shearing, my Mother the Priestess"
3553,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"asked me, ""What is the new thing which you have seen and I see in your"
3554,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"face?"" I said, ""It is a sorrow to me""; and she answered, ""All new things"
3555,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"are sorrow. Sit in my place, and eat sorrow."" I sat down in her place by"
3556,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the fire, where she talks to the ghosts in winter, and two voices spoke"
3557,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"in my heart. One voice said, ""Ask the Children of the Night for the"
3558,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Magic Knife. It is not fit that The Beast should master man."" I listened"
3559,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,to that voice.
3560,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3561,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'One voice said, ""If you go among the Trees, the Children of the Night"
3562,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"will change your spirit. Eat and sleep here."" The other voice said, ""Ask"
3563,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"for the Knife."" I listened to that voice."
3564,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3565,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I said to my Mother in the morning, ""I go away to find a thing for the"
3566,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"people, but I do not know whether I shall return in my own shape."" She"
3567,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"answered, ""Whether you live or die, or are made different, I am your"
3568,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Mother.""'"
3569,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3570,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'True,' said Puck. 'The Old Ones themselves cannot change men's mothers"
3571,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,even if they would.'
3572,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3573,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Let us thank the Old Ones! I spoke to my Maiden, the Priestess who"
3574,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,waited for me at the Dew-ponds. She promised fine things too.' The man
3575,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,laughed. 'I went away to that place where I had seen the magician with
3576,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the knife. I lay out two days on the short grass before I ventured
3577,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,among the Trees. I felt my way before me with a stick. I was afraid of
3578,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the terrible talking Trees. I was afraid of the ghosts in the branches;
3579,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"of the soft ground underfoot; of the red and black waters. I was afraid,"
3580,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"above all, of the Change. It came!'"
3581,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3582,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"They saw him wipe his forehead once again, and his strong back-muscles"
3583,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,quivered till he laid his hand on the knife-hilt.
3584,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3585,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'A fire without a flame burned in my head; an evil taste grew in my
3586,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,mouth; my eyelids shut hot over my eyes; my breath was hot between my
3587,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"teeth, and my hands were like the hands of a stranger. I was made to"
3588,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"sing songs and to mock the Trees, though I was afraid of them. At the"
3589,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"same time I saw myself laughing, and I was very sad for this fine young"
3590,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"man, who was myself. Ah! The Children of the Night know magic.'"
3591,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3592,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I think that is done by the Spirits of the Mist. They change a man if
3593,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"he sleeps among them,' said Puck. 'Had you slept in any mists?'"
3594,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3595,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Yes--but _I_ know it was the Children of the Night. After three days I
3596,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"saw a red light behind the Trees, and I heard a heavy noise. I saw the"
3597,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Children of the Night dig red stones from a hole, and lay them in fires."
3598,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The stones melted like tallow, and the men beat the soft stuff with"
3599,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"hammers. I wished to speak to these men, but the words were changed in"
3600,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"my mouth, and all I could say was, ""Do not make that noise. It hurts my"
3601,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"head."" By this I knew that I was bewitched, and I clung to the Trees,"
3602,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,and prayed the Children of the Night to take off their spells. They were
3603,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,cruel. They asked me many questions which they would never allow me to
3604,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,answer. They changed my words between my teeth till I wept. Then they
3605,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,led me into a hut and covered the floor with hot stones and dashed water
3606,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"on the stones, and sang charms till the sweat poured off me like water."
3607,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"I slept. When I waked, my own spirit--not the strange, shouting"
3608,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"thing--was back in my body, and I was like a cool bright stone on the"
3609,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,shingle between the sea and the sunshine. The magicians came to hear
3610,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,me--women and men--each wearing a Magic Knife. Their Priestess was their
3611,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Ears and their Mouth.
3612,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3613,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I spoke. I spoke many words that went smoothly along like sheep in
3614,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"order when their shepherd, standing on a mound, can count those coming,"
3615,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,and those far off getting ready to come. I asked for Magic Knives for my
3616,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"people. I said that my people would bring meat, and milk, and wool, and"
3617,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"lay them in the short grass outside the Trees, if the Children of the"
3618,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Night would leave Magic Knives for our people to take away. They were
3619,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"pleased. Their Priestess said, ""For whose sake have you come?"" I"
3620,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"answered, ""The sheep are the people. If The Beast kills our sheep, our"
3621,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"people die. So I come for a Magic Knife to kill The Beast."""
3622,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3623,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'She said, ""We do not know if our God will let us trade with the people"
3624,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"of the Naked Chalk. Wait till we have asked."""
3625,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3626,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'When they came back from the Question place (their Gods are our Gods),"
3627,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"their Priestess said, ""The God needs a proof that your words are true."""
3628,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"I said, ""What is the proof?"" She said, ""The God says that if you have"
3629,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,come for the sake of your people you will give him your right eye to be
3630,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,put out; but if you have come for any other reason you will not give it.
3631,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"This proof is between you and the God. We ourselves are sorry."""
3632,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3633,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I said, ""This is a hard proof. Is there no other road?"""
3634,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3635,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'She said, ""Yes. You can go back to your people with your two eyes in"
3636,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,your head if you choose. But then you will not get any Magic Knives for
3637,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"your people."""
3638,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3639,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I said, ""It would be easier if I knew that I were to be killed."""
3640,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3641,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'She said, ""Perhaps the God knew this too. See! I have made my knife"
3642,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"hot."""
3643,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3644,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I said, ""Be quick, then!"" With her knife heated in the flame she put"
3645,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,out my right eye. She herself did it. I am the son of a Priestess. She
3646,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,was a Priestess. It was not work for any common man.'
3647,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3648,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'True! Most true,' said Puck. 'No common man's work, that. And,"
3649,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,afterwards?'
3650,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3651,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Afterwards I did not see out of that eye any more. I found also that a
3652,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,one eye does not tell you truly where things are. Try it!'
3653,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3654,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"At this Dan put his hand over one eye, and reached for the flint"
3655,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"arrow-head on the grass. He missed it by inches. 'It's true,' he"
3656,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,whispered to Una. 'You can't judge distances a bit with only one eye.'
3657,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3658,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Puck was evidently making the same experiment, for the man laughed at"
3659,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,him.
3660,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3661,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I know it is so,' said he. 'Even now I am not always sure of my blow. I"
3662,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,stayed with the Children of the Night till my eye healed. They said I
3663,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"was the son of Tyr, the God who put his right hand in a Beast's mouth."
3664,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,They showed me how they melted their red stone and made the Magic Knives
3665,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,of it. They told me the charms they sang over the fires and at the
3666,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,beatings. I can sing many charms.' Then he began to laugh like a boy.
3667,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3668,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I was thinking of my journey home,' he said, 'and of the surprised"
3669,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Beast. He had come back to the Chalk. I saw him--I smelt his lairs as
3670,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,soon as ever I left the Trees. He did not know I had the Magic Knife--I
3671,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,hid it under my cloak--the Knife that the Priestess gave me. Ho! Ho!
3672,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"That happy day was too short! See! A Beast would wind me. ""Wow!"" he"
3673,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"would say, ""here is my Flint-worker!"" He would come leaping, tail in"
3674,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,air; he would roll; he would lay his head between his paws out of
3675,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"merriness of heart at his warm, waiting meal. He would leap--and, oh,"
3676,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,his eye in mid-leap when he saw--when he saw the knife held ready for
3677,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,him! It pierced his hide as a rush pierces curdled milk. Often he had no
3678,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,time to howl. I did not trouble to flay any beasts I killed. Sometimes I
3679,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,missed my blow. Then I took my little flint hammer and beat out his
3680,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,brains as he cowered. He made no fight. He knew the knife! But The Beast
3681,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,is very cunning. Before evening all The Beasts had smelt the blood on
3682,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"my knife, and were running from me like hares. _They_ knew! Then I"
3683,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,walked as a man should--the Master of The Beast!
3684,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3685,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'So came I back to my Mother's house. There was a lamb to be killed. I
3686,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"cut it in two halves with my knife, and I told her all my tale. She"
3687,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"said, ""This is the work of a God."" I kissed her and laughed. I went to"
3688,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,my Maiden who waited for me at the Dew-ponds. There was a lamb to be
3689,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"killed. I cut it in two halves with my knife, and told her all my tale."
3690,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"She said, ""It is the work of a God."" I laughed, but she pushed me away,"
3691,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"and being on my blind side, ran off before I could kiss her. I went to"
3692,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the Men of the Sheepguard at watering-time. There was a sheep to be
3693,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"killed for their meat. I cut it in two halves with my knife, and told"
3694,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"them all my tale. They said, ""It is the work of a God."" I said, ""We talk"
3695,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"too much about Gods. Let us eat and be happy, and to-morrow I will take"
3696,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"you to the Children of the Night, and each man will find a Magic Knife."""
3697,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3698,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I was glad to smell our sheep again; to see the broad sky from edge to
3699,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"edge, and to hear the sea. I slept beneath the stars in my cloak. The"
3700,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,men talked among themselves.
3701,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3702,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I led them, the next day, to the Trees, taking with me meat, wool, and"
3703,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"curdled milk, as I had promised. We found the Magic Knives laid out on"
3704,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the grass, as the Children of the Night had promised. They watched us"
3705,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"from among the Trees. Their Priestess called to me and said, ""How is it"
3706,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"with your people?"" I said, ""Their hearts are changed. I cannot see"
3707,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"their hearts as I used to."" She said, ""That is because you have only one"
3708,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"eye. Come to me and I will be both your eyes."" But I said, ""I must show"
3709,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"my people how to use their knives against The Beast, as you showed me"
3710,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"how to use my knife."" I said this because the Magic Knife does not"
3711,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"balance like the flint. She said, ""What you have done, you have done for"
3712,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"the sake of a woman, and not for the sake of your people."" I asked of"
3713,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"her, ""Then why did the God accept my right eye, and why are you so"
3714,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"angry?"" She answered, ""Because any man can lie to a God, but no man can"
3715,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,lie to a woman. And I am not angry with you. I am only very sorrowful
3716,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"for you. Wait a little, and you will see out of your one eye why I am"
3717,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"sorry."" So she hid herself."
3718,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3719,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I went back with my people, each one carrying his knife, and making it"
3720,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,sing in the air--_tssee-sssse_. The Flint never sings. It
3721,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,mutters--_ump-ump_. The Beast heard. The Beast saw. _He_ knew!
3722,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Everywhere he ran away from us. We all laughed. As we walked over the
3723,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,grass my Mother's brother--the Chief on the Man's Side--he took off his
3724,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Chief's necklace of yellow sea-stones.'
3725,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3726,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'How? Eh? Oh, I remember! Amber,' said Puck."
3727,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3728,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'And would have put them on my neck. I said, ""No, I am content. What"
3729,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,does my one eye matter if my other eye sees fat sheep and fat children
3730,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"running about safely?"" My Mother's brother said to them, ""I told you he"
3731,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"would never take such things."" Then they began to sing a song in the"
3732,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Old Tongue--_The Song of Tyr_. I sang with them, but my Mother's brother"
3733,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"said, ""This is _your_ song, oh, Buyer of the Knife. Let _us_ sing it,"
3734,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Tyr."""
3735,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3736,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Even then I did not understand, till I saw that--that no man stepped on"
3737,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"my shadow; and I knew that they thought me to be a God, like the God"
3738,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Tyr, who gave his right hand to conquer a Great Beast.'"
3739,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3740,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'By the Fire in the Belly of the Flint, was that so?' Puck rapped out."
3741,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3742,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'By my Knife and the Naked Chalk, so it was! They made way for my shadow"
3743,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,as though it had been a Priestess walking to the Barrows of the Dead. I
3744,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"was afraid. I said to myself, ""My Mother and my Maiden will know I am"
3745,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"not Tyr."" But _still_ I was afraid with the fear of a man who falls into"
3746,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"a steep flint-pit while he runs, and feels that it will be hard to climb"
3747,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,out.
3748,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3749,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'When we came to the Dew-ponds all our people were there. The men showed
3750,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,their knives and told their tale. The sheepguards also had seen The
3751,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Beast flying from us. The Beast went west across the river in
3752,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,packs--howling! He knew the Knife had come to the Naked Chalk at
3753,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,last--at last! _He_ knew! So my work was done. I looked for my Maiden
3754,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"among the Priestesses. She looked at me, but she did not smile. She made"
3755,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,the sign to me that our Priestesses must make when they sacrifice to the
3756,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Old Dead in the Barrows. I would have spoken, but my Mother's brother"
3757,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"made himself my Mouth, as though I had been one of the Old Dead in the"
3758,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,Barrows for whom our Priests speak to the people on Midsummer mornings.'
3759,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3760,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I remember. Well I remember those Midsummer mornings!' said Puck.
3761,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3762,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'Then I went away angrily to my Mother's house. She would have knelt
3763,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"before me. Then I was more angry, but she said, ""Only a God would have"
3764,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"spoken to me thus, a Priestess. A man would have feared the punishment"
3765,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"of the Gods."" I looked at her and I laughed. I could not stop my unhappy"
3766,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,laughing. They called me from the door by the name of Tyr himself. A
3767,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"young man with whom I had watched my first flocks, and chipped my first"
3768,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"arrow, and fought my first Beast, called me by that name in the Old"
3769,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Tongue. He asked my leave to take my Maiden. His eyes were lowered, his"
3770,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"hands were on his forehead. He was full of the fear of a God, but of"
3771,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"_me_, a man, he had no fear when he asked. I did not kill him. I said,"
3772,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"""Call the maiden."" She came also without fear--this very one that had"
3773,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"waited for me, that had talked with me by our Dew-ponds. Being a"
3774,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Priestess, she lifted her eyes to me. As I look on a hill or a cloud, so"
3775,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,she looked at me. She spoke in the Old Tongue which Priestesses use when
3776,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,they make prayers to the Old Dead in the Barrows. She asked leave that
3777,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,she might light the fire in my companion's house--and that I should
3778,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"bless their children. I did not kill her. I heard my own voice, little"
3779,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"and cold, say, ""Let it be as you desire,"" and they went away hand in"
3780,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"hand. My heart grew little and cold, a wind shouted in my ears; my eye"
3781,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"darkened. I said to my Mother, ""Can a God die?"" I heard her say, ""What"
3782,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"is it? What is it, my son?"" and I fell into darkness full of"
3783,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,hammer-noises. I was not.'
3784,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3785,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Oh, poor--poor God!' said Puck. 'And your wise Mother?'"
3786,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3787,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'_She_ knew. As soon as I dropped she knew. When my spirit came back I
3788,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"heard her whisper on my ear, ""Whether you live or die, or are made"
3789,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"different, I am your Mother."" That was good--better even than the water"
3790,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,she gave me and the going away of the sickness. Though I was ashamed to
3791,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"have fallen down, yet I was very glad. She was glad too. Neither of us"
3792,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,wished to lose the other. There is only the one Mother for the one son.
3793,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"I heaped the fire for her, and barred the doors, and sat at her feet as"
3794,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"before I went away, and she combed my hair, and sang."
3795,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3796,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I said at last, ""What is to be done to the people who say that I am"
3797,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"Tyr?"""
3798,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3799,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'She said, ""He who has done a God-like thing must bear himself like a"

3801,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"You cannot drive them off."""
3802,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3803,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'I said, ""This is a heavier sheep than I can lift."" She said, ""In time"
3804,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,it will grow easy. In time perhaps you will not lay it down for any
3805,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"maiden anywhere. Be wise--be very wise, my son, for nothing is left you"
3806,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"except the words, and the songs, and the worship of a God.""'"
3807,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3808,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Oh, poor God!' said Puck. 'But those are not altogether bad things.'"
3809,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3810,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,'I know they are not; but I would sell them all--all--all for one small
3811,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"child of my own, smearing himself with the ashes of our own house-fire.'"
3812,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3813,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"He wrenched his knife from the turf, thrust it into his belt and stood"
3814,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,up.
3815,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3816,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'And yet, what else could I have done?' he said. 'The sheep are the"
3817,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,people.'
3818,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3819,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'It is a very old tale,' Puck answered. 'I have heard the like of it not"
3820,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"only on the Naked Chalk, but also among the Trees--under Oak, and Ash,"
3821,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,and Thorn.'

3825,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,The afternoon shadows filled all the quiet emptiness of Norton's Pit.
3826,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The children heard the sheep bells and Young Jim's busy bark above them,"
3827,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,and they scrambled up the slope to the level.
3828,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3829,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'We let you have your sleep out,' said Mr. Dudeney, as the flock"

3831,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3832,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Look what I've found,' said Dan, and held up a little blue flint"

3834,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3835,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'Oh,' said Mr. Dudeney, 'the closeter you be to the turf the more you're"

3837,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,but I says they was made by folks like ourselves--only a goodish time
3838,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"back. They're lucky to keep. Now, you couldn't ever have slept--not to"

3841,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,
3842,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"'One doesn't want to sleep in the woods,' said Una."

3847,THE RUN OF THE DOWNS,"The Downs, that looked so bare and hot when they came, were full of"

3919,PHILADELPHIA,You mustn't take my stories for a guide.
3920,PHILADELPHIA,There's little left indeed of the city you will read of
3921,PHILADELPHIA,And all the folk I write about have died.
3922,PHILADELPHIA,"Now few will understand if you mention Talleyrand,"
3923,PHILADELPHIA,Or remember what his cunning and his skill did.
3924,PHILADELPHIA,"And the cabmen at the wharf do not know Count Zinnendorf,"
3925,PHILADELPHIA,Nor the Church in Philadelphia he builded.

3936,PHILADELPHIA,"Toby Hirte can't be seen at One Hundred and Eighteen,"

3941,PHILADELPHIA,"It is gone, gone, gone with Thebes the Golden"

3950,PHILADELPHIA,"It is not the slightest use to inquire for Adam Goos,"
3951,PHILADELPHIA,Or to ask where Pastor Meder has removed--so
3952,PHILADELPHIA,"You must treat as out of date the story I relate,"
3953,PHILADELPHIA,Of the Church in Philadelphia he loved so.
3954,PHILADELPHIA,
3955,PHILADELPHIA,"He is gone, gone, gone with Martin Luther,"

3979,PHILADELPHIA,
3980,PHILADELPHIA,It was almost the end of their visit to the seaside. They had turned
3981,PHILADELPHIA,"themselves out of doors while their trunks were being packed, and"
3982,PHILADELPHIA,strolled over the Downs towards the dull evening sea. The tide was dead
3983,PHILADELPHIA,"low under the chalk cliffs, and the little wrinkled waves grieved along"
3984,PHILADELPHIA,"the sands up the coast to Newhaven and down the coast to long, grey"
3985,PHILADELPHIA,"Brighton, whose smoke trailed out across the Channel."
3986,PHILADELPHIA,
3987,PHILADELPHIA,They walked to The Gap where the cliff is only a few feet high. A
3988,PHILADELPHIA,windlass for hoisting shingle from the beach below stands at the edge of
3989,PHILADELPHIA,"it. The Coastguard cottages are a little farther on, and an old ship's"
3990,PHILADELPHIA,figure-head of a Turk in a turban stared at them over the wall.
3991,PHILADELPHIA,
3992,PHILADELPHIA,"'This time to-morrow we shall be at home, thank goodness,' said Una. 'I"
3993,PHILADELPHIA,hate the sea!'
3994,PHILADELPHIA,
3995,PHILADELPHIA,"'I believe it's all right in the middle,' said Dan. 'The edges are the"
3996,PHILADELPHIA,sorrowful parts.'
3997,PHILADELPHIA,
3998,PHILADELPHIA,"Cordery, the coastguard, came out of the cottage, levelled his telescope"
3999,PHILADELPHIA,"at some fishing-boats, shut it with a click and walked away. He grew"
4000,PHILADELPHIA,"smaller and smaller along the edge of the cliff, where neat piles of"
4001,PHILADELPHIA,white chalk every few yards show the path even on the darkest night.
4002,PHILADELPHIA,
4003,PHILADELPHIA,'Where's Cordery going?' said Una.
4004,PHILADELPHIA,
4005,PHILADELPHIA,"'Half-way to Newhaven,' said Dan. 'Then he'll meet the Newhaven"
4006,PHILADELPHIA,"coastguard and turn back. He says if coastguards were done away with,"
4007,PHILADELPHIA,smuggling would start up at once.'
4008,PHILADELPHIA,
4009,PHILADELPHIA,A voice on the beach under the cliff began to sing:
4010,PHILADELPHIA,
4011,PHILADELPHIA,'The moon she shined on Telscombe Tye--
4012,PHILADELPHIA,On Telscombe Tye at night it was--
4013,PHILADELPHIA,"She saw the smugglers riding by,"
4014,PHILADELPHIA,A very pretty sight it was!'
4015,PHILADELPHIA,
4016,PHILADELPHIA,"Feet scrabbled on the flinty path. A dark, thin-faced man in very neat"
4017,PHILADELPHIA,"brown clothes and broad-toed shoes came up, followed by Puck."
4018,PHILADELPHIA,
4019,PHILADELPHIA,'Three Dunkirk boats was standin' in!'
4020,PHILADELPHIA,
4021,PHILADELPHIA,the man went on.
4022,PHILADELPHIA,
4023,PHILADELPHIA,'Hssh!' said Puck. 'You'll shock these nice young people.'
4024,PHILADELPHIA,
4025,PHILADELPHIA,'Oh! Shall I? Mille pardons!' He shrugged his shoulders almost up to his
4026,PHILADELPHIA,"ears--spread his hands abroad, and jabbered in French. 'No comprenny?'"
4027,PHILADELPHIA,he said. 'I'll give it you in Low German.' And he went off in another
4028,PHILADELPHIA,"language, changing his voice and manner so completely that they hardly"
4029,PHILADELPHIA,knew him for the same person. But his dark beady-brown eyes still
4030,PHILADELPHIA,"twinkled merrily in his lean face, and the children felt that they did"
4031,PHILADELPHIA,"not suit the straight, plain, snuffy-brown coat, brown knee-breeches,"
4032,PHILADELPHIA,and broad-brimmed hat. His hair was tied in a short pig-tail which
4033,PHILADELPHIA,danced wickedly when he turned his head.
4034,PHILADELPHIA,
4035,PHILADELPHIA,"'Ha' done!' said Puck, laughing. 'Be one thing or t'other,"
4036,PHILADELPHIA,Pharaoh--French or English or German--no great odds which.'
4037,PHILADELPHIA,
4038,PHILADELPHIA,"'Oh, but it is, though,' said Una quickly. 'We haven't begun German yet,"
4039,PHILADELPHIA,and--and we're going back to our French next week.'
4040,PHILADELPHIA,
4041,PHILADELPHIA,'Aren't you English?' said Dan. 'We heard you singing just now.'
4042,PHILADELPHIA,
4043,PHILADELPHIA,'Aha! That was the Sussex side o' me. Dad he married a French girl out
4044,PHILADELPHIA,"o' Boulogne, and French she stayed till her dyin' day. She was an"
4045,PHILADELPHIA,"Aurette, of course. We Lees mostly marry Aurettes. Haven't you ever come"
4046,PHILADELPHIA,across the saying:
4047,PHILADELPHIA,
4048,PHILADELPHIA,"'Aurettes and Lees,"
4049,PHILADELPHIA,Like as two peas.
4050,PHILADELPHIA,"What they can't smuggle,"
4051,PHILADELPHIA,They'll run over seas?'
4052,PHILADELPHIA,
4053,PHILADELPHIA,"'Then, are you a smuggler?' Una cried; and, 'Have you smuggled much?'"
4054,PHILADELPHIA,said Dan.
4055,PHILADELPHIA,
4056,PHILADELPHIA,Mr. Lee nodded solemnly.
4057,PHILADELPHIA,
4058,PHILADELPHIA,"'Mind you,' said he, 'I don't uphold smuggling for the generality o'"
4059,PHILADELPHIA,mankind--mostly they can't make a do of it--but I was brought up to the
4060,PHILADELPHIA,"trade, d'ye see, in a lawful line o' descent on'--he waved across the"
4061,PHILADELPHIA,"Channel--'on both sides the water. 'Twas all in the families, same as"
4062,PHILADELPHIA,fiddling. The Aurettes used mostly to run the stuff across from
4063,PHILADELPHIA,"Boulogne, and we Lees landed it here and ran it up to London town, by"
4064,PHILADELPHIA,the safest road.'
4065,PHILADELPHIA,
4066,PHILADELPHIA,'Then where did you live?' said Una.
4067,PHILADELPHIA,
4068,PHILADELPHIA,'You mustn't ever live too close to your business in _our_ trade. We
4069,PHILADELPHIA,"kept our little fishing smack at Shoreham, but otherwise we Lees was all"
4070,PHILADELPHIA,honest cottager folk--at Warminghurst under Washington--Bramber way--on
4071,PHILADELPHIA,the old Penn estate.'
4072,PHILADELPHIA,
4073,PHILADELPHIA,"'Ah!' said Puck, squatted by the windlass. 'I remember a piece about the"
4074,PHILADELPHIA,"Lees at Warminghurst, I do:"
4075,PHILADELPHIA,
4076,PHILADELPHIA,'There was never a Lee to Warminghurst
4077,PHILADELPHIA,That wasn't a gipsy last and first.
4078,PHILADELPHIA,
4079,PHILADELPHIA,"I reckon that's truth, Pharaoh.'"
4080,PHILADELPHIA,
4081,PHILADELPHIA,"Pharaoh laughed. 'Admettin' that's true,' he said, 'my gipsy blood must"
4082,PHILADELPHIA,"be wore pretty thin, for I've made and kept a worldly fortune.'"
4083,PHILADELPHIA,
4084,PHILADELPHIA,'By smuggling?' Dan asked.
4085,PHILADELPHIA,
4086,PHILADELPHIA,"'No, in the tobacco trade.'"
4087,PHILADELPHIA,
4088,PHILADELPHIA,'You don't mean to say you gave up smuggling just to go and be a
4089,PHILADELPHIA,tobacconist!' Dan looked so disappointed they all had to laugh.
4090,PHILADELPHIA,
4091,PHILADELPHIA,"'I'm sorry; but there's all sorts of tobacconists,' Pharaoh replied."
4092,PHILADELPHIA,"'How far out, now, would you call that smack with the patch on her"
4093,PHILADELPHIA,foresail?' He pointed to the fishing-boats.
4094,PHILADELPHIA,
4095,PHILADELPHIA,"'A scant mile,' said Puck after a quick look."
4096,PHILADELPHIA,
4097,PHILADELPHIA,'Just about. It's seven fathom under her--clean sand. That was where
4098,PHILADELPHIA,"Uncle Aurette used to sink his brandy kegs from Boulogne, and we fished"
4099,PHILADELPHIA,'em up and rowed 'em into The Gap here for the ponies to run inland. One
4100,PHILADELPHIA,"thickish night in January of '93, Dad and Uncle Lot and me came over"
4101,PHILADELPHIA,"from Shoreham in the smack, and we found Uncle Aurette and the"
4102,PHILADELPHIA,"L'Estranges, my cousins, waiting for us in their lugger with New Year's"
4103,PHILADELPHIA,presents from mother's folk in Boulogne. I remember Aunt Cecile she'd
4104,PHILADELPHIA,"sent me a fine new red knitted cap, which I put on then and there, for"
4105,PHILADELPHIA,"the French was having their Revolution in those days, and red caps was"
4106,PHILADELPHIA,all the fashion. Uncle Aurette tells us that they had cut off their King
4107,PHILADELPHIA,"Louis' head, and, moreover, the Brest forts had fired on an English"
4108,PHILADELPHIA,man-o'-war. The news wasn't a week old.
4109,PHILADELPHIA,
4110,PHILADELPHIA,"'""That means war again, when we was only just getting used to the"
4111,PHILADELPHIA,"peace,"" says Dad. ""Why can't King George's men and King Louis' men do on"
4112,PHILADELPHIA,"their uniforms and fight it out over our heads?"""
4113,PHILADELPHIA,
4114,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Me too, I wish that,"" says Uncle Aurette. ""But they'll be pressing"
4115,PHILADELPHIA,better men than themselves to fight for 'em. The press-gangs are out
4116,PHILADELPHIA,"already on our side: you look out for yours."""
4117,PHILADELPHIA,
4118,PHILADELPHIA,"'""I'll have to bide ashore and grow cabbages for a while, after I've run"
4119,PHILADELPHIA,"this cargo; but I do wish""--Dad says, going over the lugger's side with"
4120,PHILADELPHIA,our New Year presents under his arm and young L'Estrange holding the
4121,PHILADELPHIA,"lantern--""I just do wish that those folk which make war so easy had to"
4122,PHILADELPHIA,run one cargo a month all this winter. It 'ud show 'em what honest work
4123,PHILADELPHIA,"means."""
4124,PHILADELPHIA,
4125,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Well, I've warned ye,"" says Uncle Aurette. ""I'll be slipping off now"
4126,PHILADELPHIA,before your Revenue cutter comes. Give my love to sister and take care
4127,PHILADELPHIA,"o' the kegs. It's thicking to southward."""
4128,PHILADELPHIA,
4129,PHILADELPHIA,'I remember him waving to us and young Stephen L'Estrange blowing out
4130,PHILADELPHIA,the lantern. By the time we'd fished up the kegs the fog came down so
4131,PHILADELPHIA,"thick Dad judged it risky for me to row 'em ashore, even though we could"
4132,PHILADELPHIA,hear the ponies stamping on the beach. So he and Uncle Lot took the
4133,PHILADELPHIA,dinghy and left me in the smack playing on my fiddle to guide 'em back.
4134,PHILADELPHIA,
4135,PHILADELPHIA,'Presently I heard guns. Two of 'em sounded mighty like Uncle Aurette's
4136,PHILADELPHIA,three-pounders. He didn't go naked about the seas after dark. Then come
4137,PHILADELPHIA,"more, which I reckoned was Captain Giddens in the Revenue cutter. He was"
4138,PHILADELPHIA,"open-handed with his compliments, but he _would_ lay his guns himself. I"
4139,PHILADELPHIA,"stopped fiddling to listen, and I heard a whole skyful o' French up in"
4140,PHILADELPHIA,the fog--and a high bow come down on top o' the smack. I hadn't time to
4141,PHILADELPHIA,"call or think. I remember the smack heeling over, and me standing on the"
4142,PHILADELPHIA,gunwale pushing against the ship's side as if I hoped to bear her off.
4143,PHILADELPHIA,"Then the square of an open port, with a lantern in it, slid by in front"
4144,PHILADELPHIA,of my nose. I kicked back on our gunwale as it went under and slipped
4145,PHILADELPHIA,through that port into the French ship--me and my fiddle.'
4146,PHILADELPHIA,
4147,PHILADELPHIA,'Gracious!' said Una. 'What an adventure!'
4148,PHILADELPHIA,
4149,PHILADELPHIA,'Didn't anybody see you come in?' said Dan.
4150,PHILADELPHIA,
4151,PHILADELPHIA,'There wasn't any one there. I'd made use of an orlop-deck port--that's
4152,PHILADELPHIA,"the next deck below the gun-deck, which by rights should not have been"
4153,PHILADELPHIA,open at all. The crew was standing by their guns up above. I rolled on
4154,PHILADELPHIA,"to a pile of dunnage in the dark and I went to sleep. When I woke, men"
4155,PHILADELPHIA,"was talking all round me, telling each other their names and sorrows"
4156,PHILADELPHIA,just like Dad told me pressed men used to talk in the last war. Pretty
4157,PHILADELPHIA,"soon I made out they'd all been hove aboard together by the press-gangs,"
4158,PHILADELPHIA,"and left to sort 'emselves. The ship she was the _Embuscade_, a"
4159,PHILADELPHIA,"thirty-six gun Republican frigate, Captain Jean Baptiste Bompard, two"
4160,PHILADELPHIA,"days out of Le Havre, going to the United States with a Republican"
4161,PHILADELPHIA,French Ambassador of the name of Gen√™t. They had been up all night
4162,PHILADELPHIA,clearing for action on account of hearing guns in the fog. Uncle Aurette
4163,PHILADELPHIA,and Captain Giddens must have been passing the time o' day with each
4164,PHILADELPHIA,"other off Newhaven, and the frigate had drifted past 'em. She never knew"
4165,PHILADELPHIA,she'd run down our smack. Seeing so many aboard was total strangers to
4166,PHILADELPHIA,"each other, I thought one more mightn't be noticed; so I put Aunt"
4167,PHILADELPHIA,"Cecile's red cap on the back of my head, and my hands in my pockets like"
4168,PHILADELPHIA,"the rest, and, as we French say, I circulated till I found the galley."
4169,PHILADELPHIA,
4170,PHILADELPHIA,"'""What! Here's one of 'em that isn't sick!"" says a cook. ""Take his"
4171,PHILADELPHIA,"breakfast to Citizen Bompard."""
4172,PHILADELPHIA,
4173,PHILADELPHIA,"'I carried the tray to the cabin, but I didn't call this Bompard"
4174,PHILADELPHIA,"""Citizen."" Oh no! ""Mon Capitaine"" was my little word, same as Uncle"
4175,PHILADELPHIA,"Aurette used to answer in King Louis' Navy. Bompard, he liked it; he"
4176,PHILADELPHIA,"took me on for cabin servant, and after that no one asked questions; and"
4177,PHILADELPHIA,thus I got good victuals and light work all the way across to America.
4178,PHILADELPHIA,"He talked a heap of politics, and so did his officers, and when this"
4179,PHILADELPHIA,Ambassador Gen√™t got rid of his land-stomach and laid down the law
4180,PHILADELPHIA,"after dinner, a rook's parliament was nothing compared to their cabin. I"
4181,PHILADELPHIA,"learned to know most of the men which had worked the French Revolution,"
4182,PHILADELPHIA,through waiting at table and hearing talk about 'em. One of our
4183,PHILADELPHIA,forecas'le six-pounders was called Danton and t'other Marat. I used to
4184,PHILADELPHIA,"play the fiddle between 'em, sitting on the capstan. Day in and day out"
4185,PHILADELPHIA,"Bompard and Monsieur Gen√™t talked o' what France had done, and how the"
4186,PHILADELPHIA,United States was going to join her to finish off the English in this
4187,PHILADELPHIA,war. Monsieur Gen√™t said he'd justabout make the United States fight for
4188,PHILADELPHIA,France. He was a rude common man. But I liked listening. I always helped
4189,PHILADELPHIA,drink any healths that was proposed--specially Citizen Danton's who'd
4190,PHILADELPHIA,cut off King Louis' head. An all-Englishman might have been
4191,PHILADELPHIA,shocked--that's where my French blood saved me.
4192,PHILADELPHIA,
4193,PHILADELPHIA,"'It didn't save me from getting a dose of ship's fever though, the week"
4194,PHILADELPHIA,before we put Monsieur Gen√™t ashore at Charleston; and what was left of
4195,PHILADELPHIA,me after bleeding and pills took the dumb horrors from living 'tween
4196,PHILADELPHIA,"decks. The surgeon, Karaguen his name was, kept me down there to help"
4197,PHILADELPHIA,him with his plasters--I was too weak to wait on Bompard. I don't
4198,PHILADELPHIA,"remember much of any account for the next few weeks, till I smelled"
4199,PHILADELPHIA,"lilacs, and I looked out of the port, and we was moored to a wharf-edge"
4200,PHILADELPHIA,and there was a town o' fine gardens and red-brick houses and all the
4201,PHILADELPHIA,green leaves in God's world waiting for me outside.
4202,PHILADELPHIA,
4203,PHILADELPHIA,"'""What's this?"" I said to the sick-bay man--old Pierre Tiphaigne he was."
4204,PHILADELPHIA,"""Philadelphia,"" says Pierre. ""You've missed it all. We're sailing next"
4205,PHILADELPHIA,"week."""
4206,PHILADELPHIA,
4207,PHILADELPHIA,'I just turned round and cried for longing to be amongst the laylocks.
4208,PHILADELPHIA,
4209,PHILADELPHIA,"'""If that's your trouble,"" says old Pierre, ""you go straight ashore."
4210,PHILADELPHIA,None'll hinder you. They're all gone mad on these coasts--French and
4211,PHILADELPHIA,"American together. 'Tisn't _my_ notion o' war."" Pierre was an old King"
4212,PHILADELPHIA,Louis man.
4213,PHILADELPHIA,
4214,PHILADELPHIA,"'My legs was pretty tottly, but I made shift to go on deck, which it was"
4215,PHILADELPHIA,like a fair. The frigate was crowded with fine gentlemen and ladies
4216,PHILADELPHIA,"pouring in and out. They sung and they waved French flags, while Captain"
4217,PHILADELPHIA,"Bompard and his officers--yes, and some of the men--speechified to all"
4218,PHILADELPHIA,"and sundry about war with England. They shouted, ""Down with"
4219,PHILADELPHIA,"England!""--""Down with Washington!""--""Hurrah for France and the"
4220,PHILADELPHIA,"Republic!"" _I_ couldn't make sense of it. I wanted to get out from that"
4221,PHILADELPHIA,crunch of swords and petticoats and sit in a field. One of the gentlemen
4222,PHILADELPHIA,"said to me, ""Is that a genuine cap o' Liberty you're wearing?"" 'Twas"
4223,PHILADELPHIA,"Aunt Cecile's red one, and pretty near wore out. ""Oh yes!"" I says,"
4224,PHILADELPHIA,"""straight from France."" ""I'll give you a shilling for it,"" he says, and"
4225,PHILADELPHIA,with that money in my hand and my fiddle under my arm I squeezed past
4226,PHILADELPHIA,"the entry-port and went ashore. It was like a dream--meadows, trees,"
4227,PHILADELPHIA,"flowers, birds, houses, and people _all_ different! I sat me down in a"
4228,PHILADELPHIA,"meadow and fiddled a bit, and then I went in and out the streets,"
4229,PHILADELPHIA,"looking and smelling and touching, like a little dog at a fair. Fine"
4230,PHILADELPHIA,"folk was setting on the white stone doorsteps of their houses, and a"
4231,PHILADELPHIA,"girl threw me a handful of laylock sprays, and when I said ""Merci"""
4232,PHILADELPHIA,"without thinking, she said she loved the French. They was all the"
4233,PHILADELPHIA,fashion in the city. I saw more tricolour flags in Philadelphia than
4234,PHILADELPHIA,"ever I'd seen in Boulogne, and every one was shouting for war with"
4235,PHILADELPHIA,England. A crowd o' folk was cheering after our French ambassador--that
4236,PHILADELPHIA,same Monsieur Gen√™t which we'd left at Charleston. He was a-horseback
4237,PHILADELPHIA,behaving as if the place belonged to him--and commanding all and sundry
4238,PHILADELPHIA,to fight the British. But I'd heard that before. I got into a long
4239,PHILADELPHIA,"straight street as wide as the Broyle, where gentlemen was racing"
4240,PHILADELPHIA,"horses. I'm fond o' horses. Nobody hindered 'em, and a man told me it"
4241,PHILADELPHIA,was called Race Street o' purpose for that. Then I followed some black
4242,PHILADELPHIA,"niggers, which I'd never seen close before; but I left them to run after"
4243,PHILADELPHIA,"a great, proud, copper-faced man with feathers in his hair and a red"
4244,PHILADELPHIA,blanket trailing behind him. A man told me he was a real Red Indian
4245,PHILADELPHIA,"called Red Jacket, and I followed him into an alley-way off Race Street"
4246,PHILADELPHIA,"by Second Street, where there was a fiddle playing. I'm fond o'"
4247,PHILADELPHIA,fiddling. The Indian stopped at a baker's shop--Conrad Gerhard's it
4248,PHILADELPHIA,was--and bought some sugary cakes. Hearing what the price was I was
4249,PHILADELPHIA,"going to have some too, but the Indian asked me in English if I was"
4250,PHILADELPHIA,"hungry. ""Oh yes!"" I says. I must have looked a sore scrattel. He opens a"
4251,PHILADELPHIA,door on to a staircase and leads the way up. We walked into a dirty
4252,PHILADELPHIA,little room full of flutes and fiddles and a fat man fiddling by the
4253,PHILADELPHIA,"window, in a smell of cheese and medicines fit to knock you down. I"
4254,PHILADELPHIA,"_was_ knocked down too, for the fat man jumped up and hit me a smack in"
4255,PHILADELPHIA,the face. I fell against an old spinet covered with pill-boxes and the
4256,PHILADELPHIA,pills rolled about the floor. The Indian never moved an eyelid.
4257,PHILADELPHIA,
4258,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Pick up the pills! Pick up the pills!"" the fat man screeches."
4259,PHILADELPHIA,
4260,PHILADELPHIA,'I started picking 'em up--hundreds of 'em--meaning to run out under the
4261,PHILADELPHIA,"Indian's arm, but I came on giddy all over and I sat down. The fat man"
4262,PHILADELPHIA,went back to his fiddling.
4263,PHILADELPHIA,
4264,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Toby!"" says the Indian after quite a while. ""I brought the boy to be"
4265,PHILADELPHIA,"fed, not hit."""
4266,PHILADELPHIA,
4267,PHILADELPHIA,"'""What?"" says Toby, ""I thought it was Gert Schwankfelder."" He put down"
4268,PHILADELPHIA,"his fiddle and took a good look at me. ""Himmel!"" he says. ""I have hit"
4269,PHILADELPHIA,the wrong boy. It is not the new boy. Why are you not the new boy? Why
4270,PHILADELPHIA,"are you not Gert Schwankfelder?"""
4271,PHILADELPHIA,
4272,PHILADELPHIA,"'""I don't know,"" I said. ""The gentleman in the pink blanket brought me."""
4273,PHILADELPHIA,
4274,PHILADELPHIA,"'Says the Indian, ""He is hungry, Toby. Christians always feed the"
4275,PHILADELPHIA,"hungry. So I bring him."""
4276,PHILADELPHIA,
4277,PHILADELPHIA,"'""You should have said that first,"" said Toby. He pushed plates at me"
4278,PHILADELPHIA,"and the Indian put bread and pork on them, and a glass of Madeira wine."
4279,PHILADELPHIA,"I told him I was off the French ship, which I had joined on account of"
4280,PHILADELPHIA,"my mother being French. That was true enough when you think of it, and"
4281,PHILADELPHIA,besides I saw that the French was all the fashion in Philadelphia. Toby
4282,PHILADELPHIA,and the Indian whispered and I went on picking up the pills.
4283,PHILADELPHIA,
4284,PHILADELPHIA,"'""You like pills--eh?"" says Toby."
4285,PHILADELPHIA,
4286,PHILADELPHIA,"'""No,"" I says. ""I've seen our ship's doctor roll too many of 'em."""
4287,PHILADELPHIA,
4288,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Ho!"" he says, and he shoves two bottles at me. ""What's those?"""
4289,PHILADELPHIA,
4290,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Calomel,"" I says. ""And t'other's senna."""
4291,PHILADELPHIA,
4292,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Right,"" he says. ""One week have I tried to teach Gert Schwankfelder"
4293,PHILADELPHIA,"the difference between them, yet he cannot tell. You like to fiddle?"" he"
4294,PHILADELPHIA,says. He'd just seen my kit on the floor.
4295,PHILADELPHIA,
4296,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Oh yes!"" says I."
4297,PHILADELPHIA,
4298,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Oho!"" he says. ""What note is this?"" drawing his bow acrost."
4299,PHILADELPHIA,
4300,PHILADELPHIA,"'He meant it for A, so I told him it was."
4301,PHILADELPHIA,
4302,PHILADELPHIA,"'""My brother,"" he says to the Indian. ""I think this is the hand of"
4303,PHILADELPHIA,Providence! I warned that Gert if he went to play upon the wharves any
4304,PHILADELPHIA,more he would hear from me. Now look at this boy and say what you
4305,PHILADELPHIA,"think."""
4306,PHILADELPHIA,
4307,PHILADELPHIA,'The Indian looked me over whole minutes--there was a musical clock on
4308,PHILADELPHIA,the wall and dolls came out and hopped while the hour struck. He looked
4309,PHILADELPHIA,me over all the while they did it.
4310,PHILADELPHIA,
4311,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Good,"" he says at last. ""This boy is good."""
4312,PHILADELPHIA,
4313,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Good, then,"" says Toby. ""Now I shall play my fiddle and you shall sing"
4314,PHILADELPHIA,"your hymn, brother. Boy, go down to the bakery and tell them you are"
4315,PHILADELPHIA,young Gert Schwankfelder that was. The horses are in Davy Jones's
4316,PHILADELPHIA,"locker. If you ask any questions you shall hear from me."""
4317,PHILADELPHIA,
4318,PHILADELPHIA,'I left 'em singing hymns and I went down to old Conrad Gerhard. He
4319,PHILADELPHIA,wasn't at all surprised when I told him I was young Gert Schwankfelder
4320,PHILADELPHIA,that was. He knew Toby. His wife she walked me into the back yard
4321,PHILADELPHIA,"without a word, and she washed me and she cut my hair to the edge of a"
4322,PHILADELPHIA,"basin, and she put me to bed, and Oh! how I slept--how I slept in that"
4323,PHILADELPHIA,little room behind the oven looking on the flower garden! I didn't know
4324,PHILADELPHIA,Toby went to the _Embuscade_ that night and bought me off Dr. Karaguen
4325,PHILADELPHIA,for twelve dollars and a dozen bottles of Seneca Oil. Karaguen wanted a
4326,PHILADELPHIA,"new lace to his coat, and he reckoned I hadn't long to live; so he put"
4327,PHILADELPHIA,"me down as ""discharged sick.""'"
4328,PHILADELPHIA,
4329,PHILADELPHIA,"'I like Toby,' said Una."
4330,PHILADELPHIA,
4331,PHILADELPHIA,'Who was he?' said Puck.
4332,PHILADELPHIA,
4333,PHILADELPHIA,"'Apothecary Tobias Hirte,' Pharaoh replied. 'One Hundred and Eighteen,"
4334,PHILADELPHIA,"Second Street--the famous Seneca Oil man, that lived half of every year"
4335,PHILADELPHIA,"among the Indians. But let me tell my tale my own way, same as his brown"
4336,PHILADELPHIA,mare used to go to Lebanon.'
4337,PHILADELPHIA,
4338,PHILADELPHIA,'Then why did he keep her in Davy Jones's locker?' Dan asked.
4339,PHILADELPHIA,
4340,PHILADELPHIA,'That was his joke. He kept her under David Jones's hat shop in the
4341,PHILADELPHIA,"""Buck"" tavern yard, and his Indian friends kept their ponies there when"
4342,PHILADELPHIA,they visited him. I looked after the horses when I wasn't rolling pills
4343,PHILADELPHIA,"on top of the old spinet, while he played his fiddle and Red Jacket sang"
4344,PHILADELPHIA,"hymns. I liked it. I had good victuals, light work, a suit o' clean"
4345,PHILADELPHIA,"clothes, a plenty music, and quiet, smiling German folk all around that"
4346,PHILADELPHIA,"let me sit in their gardens. My first Sunday, Toby took me to his church"
4347,PHILADELPHIA,in Moravian Alley; and that was in a garden too. The women wore
4348,PHILADELPHIA,long-eared caps and handkerchiefs. They came in at one door and the men
4349,PHILADELPHIA,"at another, and there was a brass chandelier you could see your face in,"
4350,PHILADELPHIA,"and a nigger-boy to blow the organ bellows. I carried Toby's fiddle, and"
4351,PHILADELPHIA,he played pretty much as he chose all against the organ and the singing.
4352,PHILADELPHIA,"He was the only one they let do it, for they was a simple-minded folk."
4353,PHILADELPHIA,They used to wash each other's feet up in the attic to keep 'emselves
4354,PHILADELPHIA,humble: which Lord knows they didn't need.'
4355,PHILADELPHIA,
4356,PHILADELPHIA,"'How very queer,' said Una."
4357,PHILADELPHIA,
4358,PHILADELPHIA,"Pharaoh's eyes twinkled. 'I've met many and seen much,' he said; 'but I"
4359,PHILADELPHIA,haven't yet found any better or quieter or forbearinger people than the
4360,PHILADELPHIA,Brethren and Sistern of the Moravian Church in Philadelphia. Nor will I
4361,PHILADELPHIA,ever forget my first Sunday--the service was in English that week--with
4362,PHILADELPHIA,the smell of the flowers coming in from Pastor Meder's garden where the
4363,PHILADELPHIA,"big peach tree is, and me looking at all the clean strangeness and"
4364,PHILADELPHIA,thinking of 'tween decks on the _Embuscade_ only six days ago. Being a
4365,PHILADELPHIA,"boy, it seemed to me it had lasted for ever, and was going on for ever."
4366,PHILADELPHIA,But I didn't know Toby then. As soon as the dancing clock struck
4367,PHILADELPHIA,midnight that Sunday--I was lying under the spinet--I heard Toby's
4368,PHILADELPHIA,"fiddle. He'd just done his supper, which he always took late and heavy."
4369,PHILADELPHIA,"""Gert,"" says he, ""get the horses. Liberty and Independence for ever! The"
4370,PHILADELPHIA,flowers appear upon the earth and the time of the singing of birds is
4371,PHILADELPHIA,"come. We are going to my country seat in Lebanon."""
4372,PHILADELPHIA,
4373,PHILADELPHIA,"'I rubbed my eyes, and fetched 'em out of the ""Buck"" stable. Red Jacket"
4374,PHILADELPHIA,"was there saddling his, and when I'd packed the saddle-bags we three"
4375,PHILADELPHIA,rode up Race Street to the Ferry by starlight. So we went travelling.
4376,PHILADELPHIA,"It's a kindly, softly country there, back of Philadelphia among the"
4377,PHILADELPHIA,"German towns, Lancaster way. Little houses and bursting big barns, fat"
4378,PHILADELPHIA,"cattle, fat women, and all as peaceful as Heaven might be if they farmed"
4379,PHILADELPHIA,"there. Toby sold medicines out of his saddle-bags, and gave the French"
4380,PHILADELPHIA,war-news to folk along the roads. Him and his long-hilted umberell was
4381,PHILADELPHIA,as well known as the stage coaches. He took orders for that famous
4382,PHILADELPHIA,"Seneca Oil which he had the secret of from Red Jacket's Indians, and he"
4383,PHILADELPHIA,"slept in friend's farmhouses, but he _would_ shut all the windows; so"
4384,PHILADELPHIA,Red Jacket and me slept outside. There's nothing to hurt except
4385,PHILADELPHIA,snakes--and they slip away quick enough if you thrash in the bushes.'
4386,PHILADELPHIA,
4387,PHILADELPHIA,'I'd have liked that!' said Dan.
4388,PHILADELPHIA,
4389,PHILADELPHIA,'I'd no fault to find with those days. In the cool o' the morning the
4390,PHILADELPHIA,cat-bird sings. He's something to listen to. And there's a smell of
4391,PHILADELPHIA,"wild grape-vine growing in damp hollows which you drop into, after"
4392,PHILADELPHIA,"long rides in the heat, which is beyond compare for sweetness. So's"
4393,PHILADELPHIA,"the puffs out of the pine woods of afternoons. Come sundown, the frogs"
4394,PHILADELPHIA,"strike up, and later on the fireflies dance in the corn. Oh me, the"
4395,PHILADELPHIA,"fireflies in the corn! We were a week or ten days on the road, tacking"
4396,PHILADELPHIA,"from one place to another--such as Lancaster, Bethlehem-Ephrata--""thou"
4397,PHILADELPHIA,"Bethlehem-Ephrata""--no odds--I loved the going about; and so we jogged"
4398,PHILADELPHIA,"into dozy little Lebanon by the Blue Mountains, where Toby had a"
4399,PHILADELPHIA,cottage and a garden of all fruits. He come north every year for this
4400,PHILADELPHIA,wonderful Seneca Oil the Seneca Indians made for him. They'd never
4401,PHILADELPHIA,"sell to any one else, and he doctored 'em with von Swieten pills,"
4402,PHILADELPHIA,which they valued more than their own oil. He could do what he chose
4403,PHILADELPHIA,"with them, and, of course, he tried to make them Moravians. The"
4404,PHILADELPHIA,"Senecas are a seemly, quiet people, and they'd had trouble enough from"
4405,PHILADELPHIA,"white men--Americans and English--during the wars, to keep 'em in that"
4406,PHILADELPHIA,walk. They lived on a Reservation by themselves away off by their
4407,PHILADELPHIA,"lake. Toby took me up there, and they treated me as if I was their own"
4408,PHILADELPHIA,blood brother. Red Jacket said the mark of my bare feet in the dust
4409,PHILADELPHIA,was just like an Indian's and my style of walking was similar. I know
4410,PHILADELPHIA,I took to their ways all over.'
4411,PHILADELPHIA,
4412,PHILADELPHIA,'Maybe the gipsy drop in your blood helped you?' said Puck.
4413,PHILADELPHIA,
4414,PHILADELPHIA,"'Sometimes I think it did,' Pharaoh went on. 'Anyhow Red Jacket and"
4415,PHILADELPHIA,"Cornplanter, the other Seneca chief, they let me be adopted into the"
4416,PHILADELPHIA,"tribe. It's only a compliment, of course, but Toby was angry when I"
4417,PHILADELPHIA,showed up with my face painted. They gave me a side-name which means
4418,PHILADELPHIA,"""Two Tongues,"" because, d'ye see, I talked French and English."
4419,PHILADELPHIA,
4420,PHILADELPHIA,'They had their own opinions (_I_'ve heard 'em) about the French and the
4421,PHILADELPHIA,"English, _and_ the Americans. They'd suffered from all of 'em during"
4422,PHILADELPHIA,"the wars, and they only wished to be left alone. But they thought a heap"
4423,PHILADELPHIA,of the President of the United States. Cornplanter had had dealings with
4424,PHILADELPHIA,him in some French wars out West when General Washington was only a lad.
4425,PHILADELPHIA,His being President afterwards made no odds to 'em. They always called
4426,PHILADELPHIA,"him Big Hand, for he was a large-fisted man, and he was all of their"
4427,PHILADELPHIA,"notion of a white chief. Cornplanter 'ud sweep his blanket round him,"
4428,PHILADELPHIA,"and after I'd filled his pipe he'd begin--""In the old days, long ago,"
4429,PHILADELPHIA,"when braves were many and blankets were few, Big Hand said----"" If Red"
4430,PHILADELPHIA,Jacket agreed to the say-so he'd trickle a little smoke out of the
4431,PHILADELPHIA,"corners of his mouth. If he didn't, he'd blow through his nostrils. Then"
4432,PHILADELPHIA,Cornplanter 'ud stop and Red Jacket 'ud take on. Red Jacket was the
4433,PHILADELPHIA,better talker of the two. I've laid and listened to 'em for hours. Oh!
4434,PHILADELPHIA,they knew General Washington well. Cornplanter used to meet him at
4435,PHILADELPHIA,Epply's--the great dancing place in the city before District Marshal
4436,PHILADELPHIA,"William Nichols bought it. They told me he was always glad to see 'em,"
4437,PHILADELPHIA,and he'd hear 'em out to the end if they had anything on their minds.
4438,PHILADELPHIA,"They had a good deal in those days. I came at it by degrees, after I was"
4439,PHILADELPHIA,adopted into the tribe. The talk up in Lebanon and everywhere else that
4440,PHILADELPHIA,summer was about the French war with England and whether the United
4441,PHILADELPHIA,States 'ud join in with France or make a peace treaty with England. Toby
4442,PHILADELPHIA,wanted peace so as he could go about the Reservation buying his oils.
4443,PHILADELPHIA,"But most of the white men wished for war, and they was angry because"
4444,PHILADELPHIA,the President wouldn't give the sign for it. The newspaper said men was
4445,PHILADELPHIA,burning Guy Fawke images of General Washington and yelling after him in
4446,PHILADELPHIA,the streets of Philadelphia. You'd have been astonished what those two
4447,PHILADELPHIA,fine old chiefs knew of the ins and outs of such matters. The little
4448,PHILADELPHIA,I've learned of politics I picked up from Cornplanter and Red Jacket on
4449,PHILADELPHIA,the Reservation. Toby used to read the _Aurora_ newspaper. He was what
4450,PHILADELPHIA,"they call a ""Democrat,"" though our Church is against the Brethren"
4451,PHILADELPHIA,concerning themselves with politics.'
4452,PHILADELPHIA,
4453,PHILADELPHIA,"'I hate politics, too,' said Una, and Pharaoh laughed."
4454,PHILADELPHIA,
4455,PHILADELPHIA,"'I might ha' guessed it,' he said. 'But here's something that isn't"
4456,PHILADELPHIA,"politics. One hot evening late in August, Toby was reading the newspaper"
4457,PHILADELPHIA,on the stoop and Red Jacket was smoking under a peach tree and I was
4458,PHILADELPHIA,fiddling. Of a sudden Toby drops his _Aurora_.
4459,PHILADELPHIA,
4460,PHILADELPHIA,"'""I am an oldish man, too fond of my own comforts,"" he says. ""I will go"
4461,PHILADELPHIA,"to the church which is in Philadelphia. My brother, lend me a spare"
4462,PHILADELPHIA,"pony. I must be there to-morrow night."""
4463,PHILADELPHIA,
4464,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Good!"" says Red Jacket looking at the sun. ""My brother shall be there."
4465,PHILADELPHIA,"I will ride with him and bring back the ponies."""
4466,PHILADELPHIA,
4467,PHILADELPHIA,'I went to pack the saddle-bags. Toby had cured me of asking questions.
4468,PHILADELPHIA,"He stopped my fiddling if I did. Besides, Indians don't ask questions"
4469,PHILADELPHIA,much and I wanted to be like 'em.
4470,PHILADELPHIA,
4471,PHILADELPHIA,'When the horses were ready I jumped up.
4472,PHILADELPHIA,
4473,PHILADELPHIA,"'""Get off,"" says Toby. ""Stay and mind the cottage till I come back. The"
4474,PHILADELPHIA,"Lord has laid this on me, not on you--I wish he hadn't."""
4475,PHILADELPHIA,
4476,PHILADELPHIA,"'He powders off down the Lancaster road, and I sat on the door-step"
4477,PHILADELPHIA,wondering after him. When I picked up the paper to wrap his
4478,PHILADELPHIA,"fiddle-strings in, I spelled out a piece about the yellow fever being in"
4479,PHILADELPHIA,"Philadelphia so dreadful every one was running away. I was scared, for I"
4480,PHILADELPHIA,"was fond of Toby. We never said much to each other, but we fiddled"
4481,PHILADELPHIA,"together, and music's as good as talking to them that understand.'"
4482,PHILADELPHIA,
4483,PHILADELPHIA,'Did Toby die of yellow fever?' Una asked.
4484,PHILADELPHIA,
4485,PHILADELPHIA,'Not him! There's justice left in the world still. He went down to the
4486,PHILADELPHIA,City and bled 'em well again in heaps. He sent back word by Red Jacket
4487,PHILADELPHIA,"that, if there was war or he died I was to bring the oils along to the"
4488,PHILADELPHIA,"city, but till then I was to go on working in the garden and Red Jacket"
4489,PHILADELPHIA,was to see me do it. Down at heart all Indians reckon digging a squaw's
4490,PHILADELPHIA,"business, and neither him nor Cornplanter, when he relieved watch, was a"
4491,PHILADELPHIA,"hard task-master. We hired a nigger-boy to do our work, and a lazy"
4492,PHILADELPHIA,grinning runagate he was. When I found Toby didn't die the minute he
4493,PHILADELPHIA,"reached town, why, boylike, I took him off my mind and went with my"
4494,PHILADELPHIA,"Indians again. Oh! those days up north at Canasedago, running races and"
4495,PHILADELPHIA,"gambling with the Senecas, or bee-hunting in the woods, or fishing in"
4496,PHILADELPHIA,"the lake.' Pharaoh sighed and looked across the water. 'But it's best,'"
4497,PHILADELPHIA,"he went on suddenly, 'after the first frostes. You roll out o' your"
4498,PHILADELPHIA,blanket and find every leaf left green over night turned red and
4499,PHILADELPHIA,"yellow, not by trees at a time, but hundreds and hundreds of miles of"
4500,PHILADELPHIA,"'em, like sunsets splattered upside down. On one of such days--the"
4501,PHILADELPHIA,"maples was flaming scarlet and gold, and the sumach bushes were"
4502,PHILADELPHIA,"redder--Cornplanter and Red Jacket came out in full war-dress, making"
4503,PHILADELPHIA,"the very leaves look silly: feathered war-bonnets, yellow doe-skin"
4504,PHILADELPHIA,"leggings, fringed and tasselled, red horse-blankets, and their bridles"
4505,PHILADELPHIA,feathered and shelled and beaded no bounds. I thought it was war against
4506,PHILADELPHIA,"the British till I saw their faces weren't painted, and they only"
4507,PHILADELPHIA,"carried wrist-whips. Then I hummed ""Yankee Doodle"" at 'em. They told me"
4508,PHILADELPHIA,they was going to visit Big Hand and find out for sure whether he meant
4509,PHILADELPHIA,to join the French in fighting the English or make a peace treaty with
4510,PHILADELPHIA,England. I reckon those two would ha' gone out on the war-path at a nod
4511,PHILADELPHIA,"from Big Hand, but they knew well, if there was war 'twixt England and"
4512,PHILADELPHIA,"the United States, their tribe 'ud catch it from both parties same as in"
4513,PHILADELPHIA,all the other wars. They asked me to come along and hold the ponies.
4514,PHILADELPHIA,"That puzzled me, because they always put their ponies up at the ""Buck"""
4515,PHILADELPHIA,"or Epply's when they went to see General Washington in the city, and"
4516,PHILADELPHIA,"horse-holding is a nigger's job. Besides, I wasn't exactly dressed for"
4517,PHILADELPHIA,it.'
4518,PHILADELPHIA,
4519,PHILADELPHIA,'D'you mean you were dressed like an Indian?' Dan demanded.
4520,PHILADELPHIA,
4521,PHILADELPHIA,"Pharaoh looked a little abashed. 'This didn't happen at Lebanon,' he"
4522,PHILADELPHIA,"said, 'but a bit farther north, on the Reservation; and at that"
4523,PHILADELPHIA,"particular moment of time, so far as blanket, hair-band, moccasins, and"
4524,PHILADELPHIA,"sunburn went, there wasn't much odds 'twix me and a young Seneca buck."
4525,PHILADELPHIA,"You may laugh,' he smoothed down his long-skirted brown coat. 'But I"
4526,PHILADELPHIA,"told you I took to their ways all over. I said nothing, though I was"
4527,PHILADELPHIA,bursting to let out the war-whoop like the young men had taught me.'
4528,PHILADELPHIA,
4529,PHILADELPHIA,"'No, and you don't let out one here, either,' said Puck before Dan could"
4530,PHILADELPHIA,"ask. 'Go on, Brother Square-toes.'"
4531,PHILADELPHIA,
4532,PHILADELPHIA,'We went on.' Pharaoh's narrow dark eyes gleamed and danced. 'We went
4533,PHILADELPHIA,"on--forty, fifty miles a day, for days on end--we three braves. And how"
4534,PHILADELPHIA,a great tall Indian a-horseback can carry his war-bonnet at a canter
4535,PHILADELPHIA,through thick timber without brushing a feather beats _me_! My silly
4536,PHILADELPHIA,"head was banged often enough by low branches, but they slipped through"
4537,PHILADELPHIA,like running elks. We had evening hymn-singing every night after they'd
4538,PHILADELPHIA,blown their pipe-smoke to the quarters of Heaven. Where did we go? I'll
4539,PHILADELPHIA,"tell you, but don't blame me if you're no wiser. We took the old"
4540,PHILADELPHIA,war-trail from the end of the Lake along the East Susquehanna through
4541,PHILADELPHIA,"the Nantego country, right down to Fort Shamokin on the Senachse river."
4542,PHILADELPHIA,"We crossed the Juniata by Fort Granville, got into Shippensberg over the"
4543,PHILADELPHIA,"hills by the Ochwick trail, and then to Williams Ferry (it's a bad one)."
4544,PHILADELPHIA,"From Williams Ferry, across the Shanedore, over the Blue Mountains,"
4545,PHILADELPHIA,"through Ashby's Gap, and so south-east by south from there, till we"
4546,PHILADELPHIA,found the President at the back of his own plantations. I'd hate to be
4547,PHILADELPHIA,trailed by Indians in earnest. They caught him like a partridge on a
4548,PHILADELPHIA,"stump. After we'd left our ponies, we scouted forward through a woody"
4549,PHILADELPHIA,"piece, and, creeping slower and slower, at last if my moccasins even"
4550,PHILADELPHIA,slipped Red Jacket 'ud turn and frown. I heard voices--Monsieur Gen√™t's
4551,PHILADELPHIA,"for choice--long before I saw anything, and we pulled up at the edge of"
4552,PHILADELPHIA,a clearing where some niggers in grey and red liveries were holding
4553,PHILADELPHIA,"horses, and half-a-dozen gentlemen--but one was Gen√™t--were talking"
4554,PHILADELPHIA,among felled timber. I fancy they'd come to see Gen√™t a piece on his
4555,PHILADELPHIA,"road, for his portmantle was with him. I hid in between two logs as near"
4556,PHILADELPHIA,to the company as I be to that old windlass there. I didn't need anybody
4557,PHILADELPHIA,"to show me Big Hand. He stood up, very still, his legs a little apart,"
4558,PHILADELPHIA,"listening to Gen√™t, that French Ambassador, which never had more manners"
4559,PHILADELPHIA,than a Bosham tinker. Gen√™t was as good as ordering him to declare war
4560,PHILADELPHIA,on England at once. I had heard that clack before on the _Embuscade_. He
4561,PHILADELPHIA,"said he'd stir up the whole United States to have war with England,"
4562,PHILADELPHIA,whether Big Hand liked it or not.
4563,PHILADELPHIA,
4564,PHILADELPHIA,'Big Hand heard him out to the last end. I looked behind me and my two
4565,PHILADELPHIA,"chiefs had vanished like smoke. Says Big Hand, ""That is very forcibly"
4566,PHILADELPHIA,"put, Monsieur Gen√™t----"" ""Citizen--citizen!"" the fellow spits in. ""_I_,"
4567,PHILADELPHIA,"at least, am a Republican!"" ""Citizen Gen√™t,"" he says, ""you may be sure"
4568,PHILADELPHIA,"it will receive my fullest consideration."" This seemed to take Citizen"
4569,PHILADELPHIA,"Gen√™t back a piece. He rode off grumbling, and never gave his nigger a"
4570,PHILADELPHIA,penny. No gentleman!
4571,PHILADELPHIA,
4572,PHILADELPHIA,"'The others all assembled round Big Hand then, and, in their way, they"
4573,PHILADELPHIA,"said pretty much what Gen√™t had said. They put it to him, here was"
4574,PHILADELPHIA,"France and England at war, in a manner of speaking, right across the"
4575,PHILADELPHIA,"United States' stomach, and paying no regards to any one. The French was"
4576,PHILADELPHIA,"searching American ships on pretence they was helping England, but"
4577,PHILADELPHIA,"really for to steal the goods. The English was doing the same, only"
4578,PHILADELPHIA,"t'other way round, and besides searching, they was pressing American"
4579,PHILADELPHIA,"citizens into their navy to help them fight France, on pretence that"

4581,PHILADELPHIA,"clear to Big Hand. It didn't look to _them_, they said, as though the"
4582,PHILADELPHIA,United States trying to keep out of the fight was any advantage to
4583,PHILADELPHIA,"_her_, because she only catched it from both French and English. They"
4584,PHILADELPHIA,said that nine out of ten good Americans was crazy to fight the English
4585,PHILADELPHIA,then and there. They wouldn't say whether that was right or wrong; they
4586,PHILADELPHIA,only wanted Big Hand to turn it over in his mind. He did--for a while. I
4587,PHILADELPHIA,saw Red Jacket and Cornplanter watching him from the far side of the
4588,PHILADELPHIA,"clearing, and how they had slipped round there was another mystery. Then"
4589,PHILADELPHIA,"Big Hand drew himself up, and he let his gentlemen have it.'"
4590,PHILADELPHIA,
4591,PHILADELPHIA,'Hit 'em?' Dan asked.
4592,PHILADELPHIA,
4593,PHILADELPHIA,"'No, nor yet was it what you might call swearing. He--he blasted 'em"
4594,PHILADELPHIA,with his natural speech. He asked them half-a-dozen times over whether
4595,PHILADELPHIA,the United States had enough armed ships for any shape or sort of war
4596,PHILADELPHIA,"with any one. He asked 'em, if they thought she _had_ those ships, to"
4597,PHILADELPHIA,"_give_ him those ships, and they looked on the ground, as if they"
4598,PHILADELPHIA,"expected to find 'em _there_. He put it to 'em whether, setting ships"
4599,PHILADELPHIA,"aside, their country--I reckon he gave 'em good reasons--whether the"
4600,PHILADELPHIA,United States was ready or able to face a new big war; she having but so
4601,PHILADELPHIA,"few years back wound up one against England, and being all holds full of"
4602,PHILADELPHIA,"her own troubles. As I said, the strong way he laid it all before 'em"
4603,PHILADELPHIA,"blasted 'em, and when he'd done it was like a still in the woods after a"
4604,PHILADELPHIA,storm. A little man--but they all looked little--pipes up like a young
4605,PHILADELPHIA,"rook in a blowed-down nest, ""Nevertheless, General, it seems you will be"
4606,PHILADELPHIA,"compelled to fight England."" Quick Big Hand wheels on him, ""And is there"

4642,PHILADELPHIA,Red Jacket and Cornplanter rode down the clearing from the far end as
4643,PHILADELPHIA,"though they had just chanced along. Back went Big Hand's shoulders, up"
4644,PHILADELPHIA,went his head and he stepped forward one single pace with a great deep
4645,PHILADELPHIA,Hough! so pleased he was. That was a statelified meeting to
4646,PHILADELPHIA,"behold--three big men, and two of 'em looking like jewelled images among"
4647,PHILADELPHIA,the spattle of gay-coloured leaves. I saw my chiefs' war-bonnets sinking
4648,PHILADELPHIA,"together, down and down. Then they made the sign which no Indian makes"
4649,PHILADELPHIA,outside of the Medicine Lodges--a sweep of the right hand just clear of
4650,PHILADELPHIA,"the dust and an inbend of the left knee at the same time, and those"

4659,PHILADELPHIA,
4660,PHILADELPHIA,"'Big Hand looked down on 'em. First he says quite softly, ""My brothers"

4688,PHILADELPHIA,"'Let me get at my story my own way,' was the answer. 'Look! it's later"

4797,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,The day after they came home from the sea-side they set out on a tour of
4798,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,inspection to make sure everything was as they had left it. Soon they
4799,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,discovered that old Hobden had blocked their best hedge-gaps with stakes
4800,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"and thorn-bundles, and had trimmed up the hedges where the blackberries"
4801,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,were setting.
4802,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4803,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'It can't be time for the gipsies to come along,' said Una. 'Why, it was"
4804,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,summer only the other day!'
4805,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4806,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'There's smoke in Low Shaw!' said Dan, sniffing. 'Let's make sure!'"
4807,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4808,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,They crossed the fields towards the thin line of blue smoke that leaned
4809,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,above the hollow of Low Shaw which lies beside the King's Hill road. It
4810,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"used to be an old quarry till somebody planted it, and you can look"
4811,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,straight down into it from the edge of Banky Meadow.
4812,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4813,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'I thought so,' Dan whispered, as they came up to the fence at the edge"
4814,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"of the larches. A gipsy-van--not the showman's sort, but the old black"
4815,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"kind, with little windows high up and a baby-gate across the door--was"
4816,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,getting ready to leave. A man was harnessing the horses; an old woman
4817,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,crouched over the ashes of a fire made out of broken fence-rails; and a
4818,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"girl sat on the van-steps singing to a baby on her lap. A wise-looking,"
4819,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,thin dog snuffed at a patch of fur on the ground till the old woman put
4820,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,it carefully in the middle of the fire. The girl reached back inside the
4821,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"van and tossed her a paper parcel. This was laid on the fire too, and"
4822,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,they smelt singed feathers.
4823,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4824,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,'Chicken feathers!' said Dan. 'I wonder if they are old Hobden's.'
4825,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4826,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Una sneezed. The dog growled and crawled to the girl's feet, the old"
4827,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"woman fanned the fire with her hat, while the man led the horses up to"
4828,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,the shafts. They all moved as quickly and quietly as snakes over moss.
4829,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4830,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Ah!' said the girl. 'I'll teach you!' She beat the dog, who seemed to"
4831,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,expect it.
4832,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4833,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Don't do that,' Una called down. 'It wasn't his fault.'"
4834,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4835,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,'How do you know what I'm beating him for?' she answered.
4836,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4837,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'For not seeing us,' said Dan. 'He was standing right in the smoke, and"
4838,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"the wind was wrong for his nose, anyhow.'"
4839,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4840,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,The girl stopped beating the dog and the old woman fanned faster than
4841,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,ever.
4842,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4843,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'You've fanned some of your feathers out of the fire,' said Una."

4845,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4846,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'What of it?' said the old woman, as she grabbed it."
4847,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4848,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Oh, nothing!' said Dan. 'Only I've heard say that tail-feathers are as"
4849,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"bad as the whole bird, sometimes.'"
4850,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4851,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,That was a saying of Hobden's about pheasants. Old Hobden always burned
4852,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,all feather and fur before he sat down to eat.
4853,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4854,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Come on, mother,' the man whispered. The old woman climbed into the van"
4855,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,and the horses drew it out of the deep-rutted shaw on to the hard road.
4856,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4857,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,The girl waved her hands and shouted something they could not catch.

4865,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4866,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'_You_ startled old Priscilla Savile,' Puck called from below them."
4867,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,'Come and sit by their fire. She ought to have put it out before they
4868,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,left.'
4869,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4870,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,They dropped down the ferny side of the shaw. Una raked the ashes
4871,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"together, Dan found a dead wormy oak branch that burns without flame,"
4872,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,and they watched the smoke while Pharaoh played a curious wavery air.
4873,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4874,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'That's what the girl was humming to the baby,' said Una."
4875,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4876,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'I know it,' he nodded, and went on:"

4879,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,Ai Luludia!'
4880,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4881,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"He passed from one odd tune to another, and quite forgot the children."
4882,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,At last Puck asked him to go on with his adventures in Philadelphia and
4883,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,among the Seneca Indians.
4884,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4885,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'I'm telling it,' he said, staring straight in front of him as he"
4886,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,played. 'Can't you hear?'
4887,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4888,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Maybe, but _they_ can't. Tell it aloud,' said Puck."
4889,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4890,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Pharaoh shook himself, laid his fiddle beside him, and began:"

4894,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,believed Big Hand and we went home again--we three braves. When we
4895,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,reached Lebanon we found Toby at the cottage with his waistcoat a foot
4896,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,too big for him--so hard he had worked amongst the yellow-fever people.
4897,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"He beat me for running off with the Indians, but 'twas worth it--I was"
4898,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"glad to see him,--and when we went back to Philadelphia for the winter,"
4899,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,and I was told how he'd sacrificed himself over sick people in the
4900,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"yellow fever, I thought the world and all of him. No I didn't neither."
4901,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,I'd thought that all along. That yellow fever must have been something
4902,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,dreadful. Even in December people had no more than begun to trinkle back
4903,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,to town. Whole houses stood empty and the niggers was robbing them out.
4904,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,But I can't call to mind that any of the Moravian Brethren had died. It
4905,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"seemed like they had just kept on with their own concerns, and the good"

4907,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,Ninety-three--the Brethren bought a stove for the Church. Toby spoke in
4908,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"favour of it because the cold spoiled his fiddle hand, but many thought"
4909,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"stove-heat not in the Bible, and there was yet a third party which"
4910,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,always brought hickory coal foot-warmers to service and wouldn't speak
4911,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"either way. They ended by casting the Lot for it, which is like pitch"
4912,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"and toss. After my summer with the Senecas, church-stoves didn't highly"
4913,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"interest me, so I took to haunting round among the French _emigr√©s_"
4914,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,which Philadelphia was full of. My French and my fiddling helped me
4915,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"there, d'ye see. They come over in shiploads from France, where, by what"
4916,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"I made out, every one was killing every one else by any means, and they"
4917,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,spread 'emselves about the city--mostly in Drinker's Alley and Elfrith's
4918,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,Alley--and they did odd jobs till times should mend. But whatever they
4919,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"stooped to, they were gentry and kept a cheerful countenance, and after"
4920,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"an evening's fiddling at one of their poor little proud parties, the"
4921,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,Brethren seemed old-fashioned. Pastor Meder and Brother Adam Goose
4922,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"didn't like my fiddling for hire, but Toby said it was lawful in me to"
4923,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,earn my living by exercising my talents. He never let me be put upon.
4924,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4925,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'In February of Ninety-four--No, March it must have been, because a new"
4926,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"ambassador called Fauchet had come from France, with no more manners"
4927,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"than Gen√™t the old one--in March, Red Jacket came in from the"
4928,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,Reservation bringing news of all kind friends there. I showed him round
4929,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"the city, and we saw General Washington riding through a crowd of folk"
4930,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"that shouted for war with England. They gave him quite rough music, but"
4931,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,he looked 'twixt his horse's ears and made out not to notice. His stirrup
4932,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"brished Red Jacket's elbow, and Red Jacket whispered up, ""My brother knows"
4933,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"it is not easy to be a chief?"" Big Hand shot just one look at him and"
4934,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,nodded. Then there was a scuffle behind us over some one who wasn't hooting
4935,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,at Washington loud enough to please the people. We went away to be out of
4936,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,the fight. Indians won't risk being hit.'
4937,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4938,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,'What do they do if they are?' Dan asked.
4939,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4940,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Kill, of course. That's why they have such proper manners. Well, then,"
4941,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,coming home by Drinker's Alley to get a new shirt which a French
4942,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,Vicomte's lady was washing to take the stiff out of (I'm always choice
4943,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,in my body-linen) a lame Frenchman pushes a paper of buttons at us. He
4944,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"hadn't long landed in the United States, and please would we buy. He"
4945,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"sure-ly was a pitiful scrattel--his coat half torn off, his face cut,"
4946,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,but his hands steady; so I knew it wasn't drink. He said his name was
4947,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Peringuey, and he'd been knocked about in the crowd round the"
4948,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,Stadt--Independence Hall. One thing leading to another we took him up to
4949,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Toby's rooms, same as Red Jacket had taken me the year before. The"
4950,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"compliments he paid to Toby's Madeira wine fairly conquered the old man,"
4951,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,for he opened a second bottle and he told this Monsieur Peringuey all
4952,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,about our great stove dispute in the Church. I remember Pastor Meder and
4953,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Brother Adam Goose dropped in, and although they and Toby were direct"
4954,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"opposite sides regarding stoves, yet this Monsieur Peringuey he made 'em"
4955,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,feel as if he thought each one was in the right of it. He said he had
4956,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,been a clergyman before he had to leave France. He admired at Toby's
4957,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"fiddling, and he asked if Red Jacket, sitting by the spinet, was a"
4958,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"simple Huron. Senecas aren't Hurons, they're Iroquois, of course, and"
4959,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Toby told him so. Well, then, in due time he arose and left in a style"
4960,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"which made us feel he'd been favouring us, instead of us feeding him."
4961,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,I've never seen that so strong before--in a man. We all talked him over
4962,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"but couldn't make head or tail of him, and Red Jacket come out to walk"
4963,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,with me to the French quarter when I was due to fiddle at a party.
4964,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Passing Drinker's Alley again we saw a naked window with a light in it,"
4965,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,and there sat our button-selling Monsieur Peringuey throwing dice all
4966,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"alone, right hand against left."
4967,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4968,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Says Red Jacket, keeping back in the dark, ""Look at his face!"""
4969,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4970,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,'I was looking. I protest to you I wasn't frightened like I was when Big

4978,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
4979,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'I had to go on to the party, so I asked him to call round for me"
4980,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,afterwards and we'd have hymn-singing at Toby's as usual.

4982,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'""No,"" he says. ""Tell Toby I am not Christian to-night. All Indian."" He"
4983,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,had those fits sometimes. I wanted to know more about Monsieur
4984,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Peringuey, and the _emigr√©_ party was the very place to find out. It's"
4985,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"neither here nor there of course, but those French _emigr√©_ parties they"
4986,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"almost make you cry. The men that you bought fruit of in Market Street,"
4987,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"the hairdressers and fencing-masters and French teachers, they turn back"
4988,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"again by candlelight to what they used to be at home, and you catch"
4989,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"their real names. There wasn't much room in the wash-house, so I sat on"
4990,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"top of the copper and played 'em the tunes they called for--""_Si le Roi"
4991,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"m'avait donn√©_,"" and such nursery stuff. They cried sometimes. It hurt"
4992,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"me to take their money afterwards, indeed it did. And there I found out"
4993,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,about Monsieur Peringuey. He was a proper rogue too! None of 'em had a
4994,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,good word for him except the Marquise that kept the French
4995,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,boarding-house on Fourth Street. I made out that his real name was the
4996,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Count Talleyrand de P√©rigord--a priest right enough, but sorely come"
4997,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,down in the world. He'd been King Louis' ambassador to England a year or
4998,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"two back, before the French had cut off King Louis' head; and, by what I"
4999,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"heard, that head wasn't hardly more than hanging loose before he'd run"
5000,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"back to Paris and prevailed on Danton, the very man which did the"
5001,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"murder, to send him back to England again as Ambassador of the French"
5002,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Republic! That was too much for the English, so they kicked him out by"
5003,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"Act of Parliament, and he'd fled to the Americas without money or"
5004,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,friends or prospects. I'm telling you the talk in the wash-house. Some
5005,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"of 'em was laughing over it. Says the French Marquise, ""My friends, you"

5325,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"but Red Jacket and me we didn't think it likely, not unless he was quite"

5334,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,swearing it was meant to aid and comfort the English; and if a Spaniard

5336,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,too--Lord only knows what _they_ wouldn't do! It came over me that what
5337,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,I wanted in my tobacco trade was a fast-sailing ship and a man who could
5338,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"be French, English, or American at a pinch. Luckily I could lay my hands"
5339,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,on both articles. So along towards the end of September in the year '99
5340,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,I sailed from Philadelphia with a hundred and eleven hogshead o' good

5363,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,That's how we reached to the chops of the Channel. Twelve good men

5702,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,"'Yes, and Red Jacket,' said Dan."
5703,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
5704,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,'Won't you tell us any more?' they both pleaded.

5715,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,
5716,A ST. HELENA LULLABY,'Which way did they go? Which way did the runagates go?' said Hobden.

5819,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5820,EDDI'S SERVICE,"But the Saxons were keeping Christmas,"
5821,EDDI'S SERVICE,And the night was stormy as well.
5822,EDDI'S SERVICE,Nobody came to service

5825,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Wicked weather for walking,'"

5831,EDDI'S SERVICE,"An old marsh donkey came,"

5852,EDDI'S SERVICE,And he spoke to the Ass of a Rider

5854,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5855,EDDI'S SERVICE,"They steamed and dripped in the chancel,"
5856,EDDI'S SERVICE,"They listened and never stirred,"

5864,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5865,EDDI'S SERVICE,"And when the Saxons mocked him,"
5866,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Said Eddi of Manhood End,"

5876,EDDI'S SERVICE,"They had bought peppermints up at the village, and were coming home past"
5877,EDDI'S SERVICE,"little St. Barnabas's church, when they saw Jimmy Kidbrooke, the"
5878,EDDI'S SERVICE,"carpenter's baby, kicking at the churchyard gate, with a shaving in his"
5879,EDDI'S SERVICE,mouth and the tears running down his cheeks.
5880,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5881,EDDI'S SERVICE,Una pulled out the shaving and put in a peppermint. Jimmy said he was
5882,EDDI'S SERVICE,looking for his grand-daddy--he never seemed to take much notice of his
5883,EDDI'S SERVICE,"father--so they went up between the old graves, under the leaf-dropping"
5884,EDDI'S SERVICE,"limes, to the porch, where Jim trotted in, looked about the empty"
5885,EDDI'S SERVICE,"church, and screamed like a gate-hinge."
5886,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5887,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Young Sam Kidbrooke's voice came from the bell-tower, and made them"
5888,EDDI'S SERVICE,jump.
5889,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5890,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Why, Jimmy,' he called, 'what are you doin' here? Fetch him, Father!'"
5891,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5892,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Old Mr. Kidbrooke stumped downstairs, jerked Jimmy on to his shoulder,"
5893,EDDI'S SERVICE,"stared at the children beneath his brass spectacles, and stumped back"
5894,EDDI'S SERVICE,again. They laughed: it was so exactly like Mr. Kidbrooke.
5895,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5896,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'It's all right,' Una called up the stairs. 'We found him, Sam. Does"
5897,EDDI'S SERVICE,his mother know?'
5898,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5899,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'He's come off by himself. She'll be just about crazy,' Sam answered."
5900,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5901,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Then I'll run down street and tell her.' Una darted off.
5902,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5903,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Thank you, Miss Una. Would you like to see how we're mendin' the"
5904,EDDI'S SERVICE,"bell-beams, Mus' Dan?'"
5905,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5906,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Dan hopped up, and saw young Sam lying on his stomach in a most"
5907,EDDI'S SERVICE,"delightful place among beams and ropes, close to the five great bells."
5908,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Old Mr. Kidbrooke on the floor beneath was planing a piece of wood, and"
5909,EDDI'S SERVICE,Jimmy was eating the shavings as fast as they came away. He never looked
5910,EDDI'S SERVICE,at Jimmy; Jimmy never stopped eating; and the broad gilt-bobbed pendulum
5911,EDDI'S SERVICE,of the church clock never stopped swinging across the white-washed wall
5912,EDDI'S SERVICE,of the tower.
5913,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5914,EDDI'S SERVICE,Dan winked through the sawdust that fell on his up-turned face. 'Ring a
5915,EDDI'S SERVICE,"bell,' he called."
5916,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5917,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I mustn't do that, but I'll buzz one of 'em a bit for you,' said Sam."
5918,EDDI'S SERVICE,"He pounded on the sound-bow of the biggest bell, and waked a hollow"
5919,EDDI'S SERVICE,groaning boom that ran up and down the tower like creepy feelings down
5920,EDDI'S SERVICE,"your back. Just when it almost began to hurt, it died away in a hurry of"
5921,EDDI'S SERVICE,"beautiful sorrowful cries, like a wineglass rubbed with a wet finger."
5922,EDDI'S SERVICE,The pendulum clanked--one loud clank to each silent swing.
5923,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5924,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Dan heard Una return from Mrs. Kidbrooke's, and ran down to fetch her."
5925,EDDI'S SERVICE,She was standing by the font staring at some one who kneeled at the
5926,EDDI'S SERVICE,altar rail.
5927,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5928,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Is that the lady who practises the organ?' she whispered.
5929,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5930,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'No. She's gone into the organ-place. Besides, she wears black,' Dan"
5931,EDDI'S SERVICE,replied.
5932,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5933,EDDI'S SERVICE,The figure rose and came down the nave. It was a white-haired man in a
5934,EDDI'S SERVICE,"long white gown with a sort of scarf looped low on the neck, one end"
5935,EDDI'S SERVICE,hanging over his shoulder. His loose long sleeves were embroidered with
5936,EDDI'S SERVICE,"gold, and a deep strip of gold embroidery waved and sparkled round the"
5937,EDDI'S SERVICE,hem of his gown.
5938,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5939,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Go and meet him,' said Puck's voice behind the font. 'It's only"
5940,EDDI'S SERVICE,Wilfrid.'
5941,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5942,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Wilfrid who?' said Dan. 'You come along too.'
5943,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5944,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Wilfrid--Saint of Sussex, and Archbishop of York. _I_ shall wait till"
5945,EDDI'S SERVICE,he asks me.' He waved them forward. Their feet squeaked on the old grave
5946,EDDI'S SERVICE,slabs in the centre aisle. The Archbishop raised one hand with a pink
5947,EDDI'S SERVICE,"ring on it, and said something in Latin. He was very handsome, and his"
5948,EDDI'S SERVICE,thin face looked almost as silvery as his thin circle of hair.
5949,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5950,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Are you alone?' he asked.
5951,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5952,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Puck's here, of course,' said Una. 'Do you know him?'"
5953,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5954,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I know him better now than I used to.' He beckoned over Dan's shoulder,"
5955,EDDI'S SERVICE,"and spoke again in Latin. Puck pattered forward, holding himself as"
5956,EDDI'S SERVICE,straight as an arrow. The Archbishop smiled.
5957,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5958,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Be welcome,' said he. 'Be very welcome.'"
5959,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5960,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Welcome to you also, O Prince of the Church,' Puck replied. The"
5961,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Archbishop bowed his head and passed on, till he glimmered like a white"
5962,EDDI'S SERVICE,moth in the shadow by the font.
5963,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5964,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'He does look awfully princely,' said Una. 'Isn't he coming back?'"
5965,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5966,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Oh yes. He's only looking over the church. He's very fond of churches,'"
5967,EDDI'S SERVICE,said Puck. 'What's that?'
5968,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5969,EDDI'S SERVICE,The Lady who practises the organ was speaking to the blower-boy behind
5970,EDDI'S SERVICE,"the organ-screen. 'We can't very well talk here,' Puck whispered. 'Let's"
5971,EDDI'S SERVICE,go to Panama Corner.'
5972,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5973,EDDI'S SERVICE,"He led them to the end of the south aisle, where there is a slab of iron"
5974,EDDI'S SERVICE,"which says in queer, long-tailed letters: _Orate p. annema Jhone"
5975,EDDI'S SERVICE,Coline._ The children always called it Panama Corner.
5976,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5977,EDDI'S SERVICE,"The Archbishop moved slowly about the little church, peering at the old"
5978,EDDI'S SERVICE,memorial tablets and the new glass windows. The Lady who practises the
5979,EDDI'S SERVICE,organ began to pull out stops and rustle hymnbooks behind the screen.
5980,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5981,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I hope she'll do all the soft lacey tunes--like treacle on porridge,'"
5982,EDDI'S SERVICE,said Una.
5983,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5984,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I like the trumpety ones best,' said Dan. 'Oh, look at Wilfrid! He's"
5985,EDDI'S SERVICE,trying to shut the altar gates!'
5986,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5987,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Tell him he mustn't,' said Puck, quite seriously."
5988,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5989,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'He can't, anyhow,' Dan muttered, and tiptoed out of Panama Corner while"
5990,EDDI'S SERVICE,the Archbishop patted and patted at the carved gates that always sprang
5991,EDDI'S SERVICE,open again beneath his hand.
5992,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5993,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'That's no use, sir,' Dan whispered. 'Old Mr. Kidbrooke says altar-gates"
5994,EDDI'S SERVICE,are just _the_ one pair of gates which no man can shut. He made 'em so
5995,EDDI'S SERVICE,himself.'
5996,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5997,EDDI'S SERVICE,The Archbishop's blue eyes twinkled. Dan saw that he knew all about it.
5998,EDDI'S SERVICE,
5999,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I beg your pardon,' Dan stammered--very angry with Puck."
6000,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6001,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Yes, I know! He made them so Himself.' The Archbishop smiled, and"
6002,EDDI'S SERVICE,"crossed to Panama Corner, where Una dragged up a certain padded"
6003,EDDI'S SERVICE,arm-chair for him to sit on.
6004,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6005,EDDI'S SERVICE,The organ played softly. 'What does that music say?' he asked.
6006,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6007,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Una dropped into the chant without thinking: '""Oh, all ye works of the"
6008,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise him and magnify him for ever."" We call"
6009,EDDI'S SERVICE,"it the Noah's Ark, because it's all lists of things--beasts and birds"
6010,EDDI'S SERVICE,"and whales, you know.'"
6011,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6012,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Whales?' said the Archbishop quickly.
6013,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6014,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Yes--""O ye whales, and all that move in the waters,""' Una"
6015,EDDI'S SERVICE,"hummed--'""Bless ye the Lord""--it sounds like a wave turning over,"
6016,EDDI'S SERVICE,doesn't it?'
6017,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6018,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Holy Father,' said Puck with a demure face, 'is a little seal also ""one"
6019,EDDI'S SERVICE,"who moves in the water""?'"
6020,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6021,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Eh? Oh yes--yess!' he laughed. 'A seal moves wonderfully in the waters.
6022,EDDI'S SERVICE,Do the seal come to my island still?'
6023,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6024,EDDI'S SERVICE,Puck shook his head. 'All those little islands have been swept away.'
6025,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6026,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Very possible. The tides ran fiercely down there. Do you know the land
6027,EDDI'S SERVICE,"of the Sea-calf, maiden?'"
6028,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6029,EDDI'S SERVICE,'No--but we've seen seals--at Brighton.'
6030,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6031,EDDI'S SERVICE,'The Archbishop is thinking of a little farther down the coast. He means
6032,EDDI'S SERVICE,Seal's Eye--Selsea--down Chichester way--where he converted the South
6033,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Saxons,' Puck explained."
6034,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6035,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Yes--yess; if the South Saxons did not convert me,' said the"
6036,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Archbishop, smiling. 'The first time I was wrecked was on that coast. As"
6037,EDDI'S SERVICE,"our ship took ground and we tried to push her off, an old fat fellow, I"
6038,EDDI'S SERVICE,"remember, reared breast high out of the water, and scratched his head"
6039,EDDI'S SERVICE,"with his flipper as if he were saying: ""What _does_ that respectable"
6040,EDDI'S SERVICE,"person with the pole think he is doing?"" I was very wet and miserable,"
6041,EDDI'S SERVICE,"but I could not help laughing, till the natives came down and attacked"
6042,EDDI'S SERVICE,us.'
6043,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6044,EDDI'S SERVICE,'What did you do?' Dan asked.
6045,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6046,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'One couldn't very well go back to France, so one tried to make them go"
6047,EDDI'S SERVICE,"back to the shore. All the South Saxons are born wreckers, like my own"
6048,EDDI'S SERVICE,Northumbrian folk. I was bringing over a few things for my old church at
6049,EDDI'S SERVICE,"York, and some of the natives laid hands on them, and--and I'm afraid I"
6050,EDDI'S SERVICE,lost my temper.'
6051,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6052,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'It is said,' Puck's voice was wickedly meek, 'that there was a great"
6053,EDDI'S SERVICE,fight.'
6054,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6055,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Eh, but I must ha' been a silly lad.' Wilfrid spoke with a sudden thick"
6056,EDDI'S SERVICE,"burr in his voice. He coughed, and took up his silvery tones again."
6057,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'There was no fight really. My men thumped a few of them, but the tide"
6058,EDDI'S SERVICE,"rose half an hour before its time, with a strong wind, and we backed"
6059,EDDI'S SERVICE,"off. What I wanted to say, though, was, that the seas about us were full"
6060,EDDI'S SERVICE,of sleek seals watching the scuffle. My good Eddi--my chaplain--insisted
6061,EDDI'S SERVICE,that they were demons. Yes--yess! That was my first acquaintance with
6062,EDDI'S SERVICE,the South Saxons and their seals.'
6063,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6064,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'But not the only time you were wrecked, was it?' said Dan."
6065,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6066,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Alas, no! On sea and land my life seems to have been one long"
6067,EDDI'S SERVICE,"shipwreck,' He looked at the Jhone Coline slab as old Hobden sometimes"
6068,EDDI'S SERVICE,"looks into the fire. 'Ah, well!'"
6069,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6070,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'But did you ever have any more adventures among the seals?' said Una,"
6071,EDDI'S SERVICE,after a pause.
6072,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6073,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Oh, the seals! I beg your pardon. They are the important things."
6074,EDDI'S SERVICE,Yes--yess! I went back to the South Saxons after twelve--fifteen years.
6075,EDDI'S SERVICE,"No, I did not come by water, but overland from my own Northumbria, to"
6076,EDDI'S SERVICE,see what I could do. It's little one _can_ do with that class of native
6077,EDDI'S SERVICE,except make them stop killing each other and themselves----'
6078,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6079,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Why did they kill themselves?' Una asked, her chin in her hand."
6080,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6081,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Because they were heathen. When they grew tired of life (as if they
6082,EDDI'S SERVICE,were the only people) they would jump into the sea. They called it going
6083,EDDI'S SERVICE,to Wotan. It wasn't want of food always--by any means. A man would tell
6084,EDDI'S SERVICE,"you that he felt grey in the heart, or a woman would say that she saw"
6085,EDDI'S SERVICE,nothing but long days in front of her; and they'd saunter away to the
6086,EDDI'S SERVICE,"mud-flats and--that would be the end of them, poor souls, unless one"
6087,EDDI'S SERVICE,"headed them off! One had to run quick, but one can't allow people to lay"
6088,EDDI'S SERVICE,hands on themselves because they happen to feel grey. Yes--yess!
6089,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Extraordinary people, the South Saxons. Disheartening, sometimes...."
6090,EDDI'S SERVICE,What does that say now?' The organ had changed tune again.
6091,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6092,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Only a hymn for next Sunday,' said Una. '""The Church's One Foundation."""
6093,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Go on, please, about running over the mud. I should like to have seen"
6094,EDDI'S SERVICE,you.'
6095,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6096,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I dare say you would, and I really _could_ run in those days."
6097,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Ethelwalch the king gave me some five or six muddy parishes by the sea,"
6098,EDDI'S SERVICE,and the first time my good Eddi and I rode there we saw a man slouching
6099,EDDI'S SERVICE,"along the slob, among the seals at Manhood End. My good Eddi disliked"
6100,EDDI'S SERVICE,seals--but he swallowed his objections and ran like a hare.'
6101,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6102,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Why?' said Dan.
6103,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6104,EDDI'S SERVICE,'For the same reason that I did. We thought it was one of our people
6105,EDDI'S SERVICE,"going to drown himself. As a matter of fact, Eddi and I were nearly"
6106,EDDI'S SERVICE,"drowned in the pools before we overtook him. To cut a long story short,"
6107,EDDI'S SERVICE,"we found ourselves very muddy, very breathless, being quietly made fun"
6108,EDDI'S SERVICE,of in good Latin by a very well-spoken person. No--he'd no idea of going
6109,EDDI'S SERVICE,"to Wotan. He was fishing on his own beaches, and he showed us the"
6110,EDDI'S SERVICE,beacons and turf-heaps that divided his lands from the Church property.
6111,EDDI'S SERVICE,"He took us to his own house, gave us a good dinner, some more than good"
6112,EDDI'S SERVICE,"wine, sent a guide with us into Chichester, and became one of my best"
6113,EDDI'S SERVICE,"and most refreshing friends. He was a Meon by descent, from the west"
6114,EDDI'S SERVICE,"edge of the kingdom; a scholar educated, curiously enough, at Lyons, my"
6115,EDDI'S SERVICE,"old school; had travelled the world over, even to Rome, and was a"
6116,EDDI'S SERVICE,brilliant talker. We found we had scores of acquaintances in common. It
6117,EDDI'S SERVICE,"seemed he was a small chief under King Ethelwalch, and I fancy the King"
6118,EDDI'S SERVICE,was somewhat afraid of him. The South Saxons mistrust a man who talks
6119,EDDI'S SERVICE,"too well. Ah! _Now_, I've left out the very point of my story. He kept a"
6120,EDDI'S SERVICE,great grey-muzzled old dog-seal that he had brought up from a pup. He
6121,EDDI'S SERVICE,"called it Padda--after one of my clergy. It _was_ rather like fat,"
6122,EDDI'S SERVICE,"honest old Padda. The creature followed him everywhere, and nearly"
6123,EDDI'S SERVICE,knocked down my good Eddi when we first met him. Eddi loathed it. It
6124,EDDI'S SERVICE,used to sniff at his thin legs and cough at him. I can't say I ever took
6125,EDDI'S SERVICE,"much notice of it (I was not fond of animals), till one day Eddi came to"
6126,EDDI'S SERVICE,me with a circumstantial account of some witchcraft that Meon worked. He
6127,EDDI'S SERVICE,"would tell the seal to go down to the beach the last thing at night, and"
6128,EDDI'S SERVICE,"bring him word of the weather. When it came back, Meon might say to his"
6129,EDDI'S SERVICE,"slaves, ""Padda thinks we shall have wind to-morrow. Haul up the boats!"""
6130,EDDI'S SERVICE,"I spoke to Meon casually about the story, and he laughed."
6131,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6132,EDDI'S SERVICE,'He told me he could judge by the look of the creature's coat and the
6133,EDDI'S SERVICE,way it sniffed what weather was brewing. Quite possible. One need not
6134,EDDI'S SERVICE,put down everything one does not understand to the work of bad
6135,EDDI'S SERVICE,"spirits--or good ones, for that matter.' He nodded towards Puck, who"
6136,EDDI'S SERVICE,nodded gaily in return.
6137,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6138,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I say so,' he went on, 'because to a certain extent I have been made a"
6139,EDDI'S SERVICE,"victim of that habit of mind. Some while after I was settled at Selsea,"
6140,EDDI'S SERVICE,King Ethelwalch and Queen Ebba ordered their people to be baptized. I
6141,EDDI'S SERVICE,fear I'm too old to believe that a whole nation can change its heart at
6142,EDDI'S SERVICE,"the King's command, and I had a shrewd suspicion that their real motive"
6143,EDDI'S SERVICE,"was to get a good harvest. No rain had fallen for two or three years,"
6144,EDDI'S SERVICE,"but as soon as we had finished baptizing, it fell heavily, and they all"
6145,EDDI'S SERVICE,said it was a miracle.'
6146,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6147,EDDI'S SERVICE,'And was it?' Dan asked.
6148,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6149,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Everything in life is a miracle, but'--the Archbishop twisted the heavy"
6150,EDDI'S SERVICE,ring on his finger--'I should be slow--ve-ry slow should I be--to assume
6151,EDDI'S SERVICE,that a certain sort of miracle happens whenever lazy and improvident
6152,EDDI'S SERVICE,people say they are going to turn over a new leaf if they are paid for
6153,EDDI'S SERVICE,"it. My friend Meon had sent his slaves to the font, but he had not come"
6154,EDDI'S SERVICE,"himself, so the next time I rode over--to return a manuscript--I took"
6155,EDDI'S SERVICE,the liberty of asking why. He was perfectly open about it. He looked on
6156,EDDI'S SERVICE,the King's action as a heathen attempt to curry favour with the
6157,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Christians' God through me the Archbishop, and he would have none of it."
6158,EDDI'S SERVICE,"""My dear man,"" I said, ""admitting that that is the case, surely you, as"
6159,EDDI'S SERVICE,"an educated person, don't believe in Wotan and all the other hobgoblins"
6160,EDDI'S SERVICE,"any more than Padda here."" The old seal was hunched up on his ox-hide"
6161,EDDI'S SERVICE,behind his master's chair.
6162,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6163,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Even if I don't,"" he said, ""why should I insult the memory of my"

6166,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6167,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""By no means,"" I answered. ""I want _you_."""
6168,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6169,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""He wants us! What do you think of that, Padda?"" He pulled the seal's"
6170,EDDI'S SERVICE,"whiskers till it threw back its head and roared, and he pretended to"
6171,EDDI'S SERVICE,"interpret. ""No! Padda says he won't be baptized yet awhile. He says"
6172,EDDI'S SERVICE,"you'll stay to dinner and come fishing with me to-morrow, because you're"
6173,EDDI'S SERVICE,"overworked and need a rest."""
6174,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6175,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""I wish you'd keep yon brute in its proper place,"" I said, and Eddi, my"
6176,EDDI'S SERVICE,"chaplain, agreed."
6177,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6178,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""I do,"" said Meon. ""I keep him just next my heart. He can't tell a lie,"
6179,EDDI'S SERVICE,and he doesn't know how to love any one except me. It 'ud be the same if
6180,EDDI'S SERVICE,"I were dying on a mud-bank, wouldn't it, Padda?"""
6181,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6182,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Augh! Augh!"" said Padda, and put up his head to be scratched."
6183,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6184,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Then Meon began to tease Eddi: ""Padda says, if Eddi saw his Archbishop"
6185,EDDI'S SERVICE,dying on a mud-bank Eddi would tuck up his gown and run. Padda knows
6186,EDDI'S SERVICE,Eddi can run too! Padda came into Wittering Church last Sunday--all
6187,EDDI'S SERVICE,"wet--to hear the music, and Eddi ran out."""
6188,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6189,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'My good Eddi rubbed his hands and his shins together, and flushed."
6190,EDDI'S SERVICE,"""Padda is a child of the Devil, who is the father of lies!"" he cried,"
6191,EDDI'S SERVICE,and begged my pardon for having spoken. I forgave him.
6192,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6193,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Yes. You are just about stupid enough for a musician,"" said Meon. ""But"
6194,EDDI'S SERVICE,"here he is. Sing a hymn to him, and see if he can stand it. You'll find"
6195,EDDI'S SERVICE,"my small harp beside the fireplace."""
6196,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6197,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Eddi, who is really an excellent musician, played and sang for quite"
6198,EDDI'S SERVICE,"half an hour. Padda shuffled off his ox-hide, hunched himself on his"
6199,EDDI'S SERVICE,"flippers before him, and listened with his head thrown back. Yes--yess!"
6200,EDDI'S SERVICE,"A rather funny sight! Meon tried not to laugh, and asked Eddi if he were"
6201,EDDI'S SERVICE,satisfied.
6202,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6203,EDDI'S SERVICE,'It takes some time to get an idea out of my good Eddi's head. He looked

6206,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Do you want to sprinkle him with holy water, and see if he flies up"
6207,EDDI'S SERVICE,"the chimney? Why not baptize him?"" said Meon."
6208,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6209,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Eddi was really shocked. I thought it was bad taste myself.

6213,EDDI'S SERVICE,a chance to prove it you won't take it. Look here! I'll make a bargain.
6214,EDDI'S SERVICE,I'll be baptized if you'll baptize Padda too. He's more of a man than

6216,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6217,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""One doesn't bargain--or joke--about these matters,"" I said. He was"

6237,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6238,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'The next was a beautiful crisp autumn morning--a weather breeder, if I"
6239,EDDI'S SERVICE,had taken the trouble to think; but it's refreshing to escape from kings
6240,EDDI'S SERVICE,and converts for half a day. We three went by ourselves in Meon's
6241,EDDI'S SERVICE,"smallest boat, and we got on the whiting near an old wreck, a mile or so"
6242,EDDI'S SERVICE,"off shore. Meon knew the marks to a yard, and the fish were keen."
6243,EDDI'S SERVICE,Yes--yess! A perfect morning's fishing! If a bishop can't be a
6244,EDDI'S SERVICE,"fisherman, who can?' He twiddled his ring again. 'We stayed there a"
6245,EDDI'S SERVICE,"little too long, and while we were getting up our stone, down came the"
6246,EDDI'S SERVICE,"fog. After some discussion, we decided to row for the land. The ebb was"
6247,EDDI'S SERVICE,"just beginning to make round the point, and sent us all ways at once"
6248,EDDI'S SERVICE,like a coracle.'
6249,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6250,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Selsea Bill,' said Puck under his breath. 'The tides run something"

6252,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6253,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I believe you,' said the Archbishop. 'Meon and I have spent a good many"

6255,EDDI'S SERVICE,ourselves in a little rocky cove that had sprung up round us out of the
6256,EDDI'S SERVICE,"fog, and a swell lifted the boat on to a ledge, and she broke up beneath"
6257,EDDI'S SERVICE,our feet. We had just time to shuffle through the weed before the next

6266,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6267,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Save what you can of the boat,"" said Meon; ""we may need it,"" and we"
6268,EDDI'S SERVICE,"had to drench ourselves again, fishing out stray planks.'"
6269,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6270,EDDI'S SERVICE,'What for?' said Dan.
6271,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6272,EDDI'S SERVICE,'For firewood. We did not know when we should get off. Eddi had flint
6273,EDDI'S SERVICE,"and steel, and we found dry fuel in the old gulls' nests and lit a fire."
6274,EDDI'S SERVICE,"It smoked abominably, and we guarded it with boat-planks up-ended"
6275,EDDI'S SERVICE,between the rocks. One gets used to that sort of thing if one travels.
6276,EDDI'S SERVICE,Unluckily I'm not so strong as I was. I fear I must have been a trouble
6277,EDDI'S SERVICE,to my friends. It was blowing a full gale before midnight. Eddi wrung
6278,EDDI'S SERVICE,"out his cloak, and tried to wrap me in it, but I ordered him on his"
6279,EDDI'S SERVICE,"obedience to keep it. However, he held me in his arms all the first"

6293,EDDI'S SERVICE,"his mouth, but he braced himself against a rock and sang psalms."
6294,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6295,EDDI'S SERVICE,'I'm glad I never concealed my opinion--from myself--that Eddi was a

6355,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Surely,"" said Eddi, with his mouth full, ""God has made the seal the"
6356,EDDI'S SERVICE,loveliest of His creatures in the water. Look how Padda breasts the
6357,EDDI'S SERVICE,current! He stands up against it like a rock; now watch the chain of
6358,EDDI'S SERVICE,bubbles where he dives; and now--there is his wise head under that rock
6359,EDDI'S SERVICE,"ledge! Oh, a blessing be on thee, my little brother Padda!"""
6360,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6361,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""You _said_ he was a child of the Devil!"" Meon laughed."
6362,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6363,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""There I sinned,"" poor Eddi answered. ""Call him here, and I will ask"
6364,EDDI'S SERVICE,"his pardon. God sent him out of the storm to humble me, a fool."""
6365,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6366,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""I won't ask you to enter into fellowships and understandings with any"
6367,EDDI'S SERVICE,"accursed brute,"" said Meon, rather unkindly. ""Shall we say he was sent"
6368,EDDI'S SERVICE,"to our Bishop as the ravens were sent to your prophet Elijah?"""
6369,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6370,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Doubtless that is so,"" said Eddi. ""I will write it so if I live to get"
6371,EDDI'S SERVICE,"home."""
6372,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6373,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""No--no!"" I said. ""Let us three poor men kneel and thank God for His"
6374,EDDI'S SERVICE,"mercies."""
6375,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6376,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'We kneeled, and old Padda shuffled up and thrust his head under Meon's"
6377,EDDI'S SERVICE,elbows. I laid my hand upon it and blessed him. So did Eddi.
6378,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6379,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""And now, my son,"" I said to Meon, ""shall I baptize thee?"""
6380,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6381,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Not yet,"" said he. ""Wait till we are well ashore and at home. No God"
6382,EDDI'S SERVICE,in any Heaven shall say that I came to him or left him because I was wet
6383,EDDI'S SERVICE,"and cold. I will send Padda to my people for a boat. Is that witchcraft,"
6384,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Eddi?"""
6385,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6386,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""Why, no. Surely Padda will go and pull them to the beach by the skirts"
6387,EDDI'S SERVICE,of their gowns as he pulled me in Wittering Church to ask me to sing.
6388,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Only then I was afraid, and did not understand,"" said Eddi."
6389,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6390,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'""You are understanding now,"" said Meon, and at a wave of his arm off"
6391,EDDI'S SERVICE,"went Padda to the mainland, making a wake like a war-boat till we lost"
6392,EDDI'S SERVICE,him in the rain. Meon's people could not bring a boat across for some
6393,EDDI'S SERVICE,hours; even so it was ticklish work among the rocks in that tideway. But
6394,EDDI'S SERVICE,"they hoisted me aboard, too stiff to move, and Padda swam behind us,"
6395,EDDI'S SERVICE,barking and turning somersaults all the way to Manhood End!'
6396,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6397,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Good old Padda!' murmured Dan.
6398,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6399,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'When we were quite rested and re-clothed, and his people had been"
6400,EDDI'S SERVICE,summoned--not an hour before--Meon offered himself to be baptized.'
6401,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6402,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Was Padda baptized too?' Una asked.
6403,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6404,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'No, that was only Meon's joke. But he sat blinking on his ox-hide in"
6405,EDDI'S SERVICE,the middle of the hall. When Eddi (who thought I wasn't looking) made a
6406,EDDI'S SERVICE,"little cross in holy water on his wet muzzle, he kissed Eddi's hand. A"
6407,EDDI'S SERVICE,"week before Eddi wouldn't have touched him. _That_ was a miracle, if you"
6408,EDDI'S SERVICE,"like! But seriously, I was more glad than I can tell you to get Meon. A"
6409,EDDI'S SERVICE,rare and splendid soul that never looked back--never looked back!' The
6410,EDDI'S SERVICE,Archbishop half closed his eyes.
6411,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6412,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'But, sir,' said Puck, most respectfully, 'haven't you left out what"
6413,EDDI'S SERVICE,Meon said afterwards?' Before the Bishop could speak he turned to the
6414,EDDI'S SERVICE,children and went on: 'Meon called all his fishers and ploughmen and
6415,EDDI'S SERVICE,"herdsmen into the hall and he said: ""Listen, men! Two days ago I asked"
6416,EDDI'S SERVICE,our Bishop whether it was fair for a man to desert his fathers' Gods in
6417,EDDI'S SERVICE,a time of danger. Our Bishop said it was not fair. You needn't shout
6418,EDDI'S SERVICE,"like that, because you are all Christians now. My red war-boat's crew"
6419,EDDI'S SERVICE,will remember how near we all were to death when Padda fetched them over
6420,EDDI'S SERVICE,"to the Bishop's islet. You can tell your mates that even in that place,"
6421,EDDI'S SERVICE,"at that time, hanging on the wet, weedy edge of death, our Bishop, a"
6422,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Christian, counselled me, a heathen, to stand by my fathers' Gods. I"
6423,EDDI'S SERVICE,tell you now that a faith which takes care that every man shall keep
6424,EDDI'S SERVICE,"faith, even though he may save his soul by breaking faith, is the faith"
6425,EDDI'S SERVICE,"for a man to believe in. So I believe in the Christian God, and in"
6426,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Wilfrid His Archbishop, and in the Church that Wilfrid rules. You have"
6427,EDDI'S SERVICE,been baptized once by the King's orders. I shall not have you baptized
6428,EDDI'S SERVICE,"again; but if I find any more old women being sent to Wotan, or any"
6429,EDDI'S SERVICE,"girls dancing on the sly before Balder, or any men talking about Thun or"
6430,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Lok or the rest, I will teach you with my own hands how to keep faith"
6431,EDDI'S SERVICE,with the Christian God. Go out quietly; you'll find a couple of beefs on
6432,EDDI'S SERVICE,"the beach."" Then of course they shouted ""Hurrah!"" which meant ""Thor help"
6433,EDDI'S SERVICE,"us!"" and--I think you laughed, sir?'"
6434,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6435,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I think you remember it all too well,' said the Archbishop, smiling."
6436,EDDI'S SERVICE,'It was a joyful day for me. I had learned a great deal on that rock
6437,EDDI'S SERVICE,where Padda found us. Yes--yess! One should deal kindly with all the
6438,EDDI'S SERVICE,"creatures of God, and gently with their masters. But one learns late.'"
6439,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6440,EDDI'S SERVICE,"He rose, and his gold-embroidered sleeves rustled thickly."
6441,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6442,EDDI'S SERVICE,The organ clacked and took deep breaths.
6443,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6444,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Wait a minute,' Dan whispered. 'She's going to do the trumpety one. It"
6445,EDDI'S SERVICE,"takes all the wind you can pump. It's in Latin, sir.'"
6446,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6447,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'There is no other tongue,' the Archbishop answered."
6448,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6449,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'It's not a real hymn,' Una explained. 'She does it as a treat after her"
6450,EDDI'S SERVICE,"exercises. She isn't a real organist, you know. She just comes down here"
6451,EDDI'S SERVICE,"sometimes, from the Albert Hall.'"
6452,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6453,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Oh, what a miracle of a voice!' said the Archbishop."
6454,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6455,EDDI'S SERVICE,It rang out suddenly from a dark arch of lonely noises--every word
6456,EDDI'S SERVICE,spoken to the very end.
6457,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6458,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Dies Irae, dies illa"
6459,EDDI'S SERVICE,Solvet saeclum in favilla
6460,EDDI'S SERVICE,Teste David cum Sibylla.'
6461,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6462,EDDI'S SERVICE,The Archbishop caught his breath and moved forward.
6463,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6464,EDDI'S SERVICE,The music carried on by itself a while.
6465,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6466,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Now it's calling all the light out of the windows,' Una whispered to"
6467,EDDI'S SERVICE,Dan.
6468,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6469,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'I think it's more like a horse neighing in battle,' he whispered back."
6470,EDDI'S SERVICE,The voice cried:
6471,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6472,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Tuba mirum spargens sonum
6473,EDDI'S SERVICE,Per sepulchra regionum.'
6474,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6475,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Deeper and deeper the organ dived down, but far below its deepest note"
6476,EDDI'S SERVICE,they heard Puck's voice joining in the last line:
6477,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6478,EDDI'S SERVICE,'Coget omnes ante thronum.'
6479,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6480,EDDI'S SERVICE,"As they looked in wonder, for it sounded like the dull jar of one of the"
6481,EDDI'S SERVICE,"very pillars shifting, the little fellow turned and went out through the"
6482,EDDI'S SERVICE,south door.
6483,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6484,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Now's the sorrowful part, but it's very beautiful.' Una found herself"
6485,EDDI'S SERVICE,speaking to the empty chair in front of her.
6486,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6487,EDDI'S SERVICE,'What are you doing that for?' Dan said behind her. 'You spoke so
6488,EDDI'S SERVICE,politely too.'
6489,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6490,EDDI'S SERVICE,'I don't know ... I thought ...' said Una. 'Funny!'
6491,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6492,EDDI'S SERVICE,"''Tisn't. It's the part you like best,' Dan grunted."
6493,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6494,EDDI'S SERVICE,The music had turned soft--full of little sounds that chased each other
6495,EDDI'S SERVICE,on wings across the broad gentle flood of the main tune. But the voice
6496,EDDI'S SERVICE,was ten times lovelier than the music.
6497,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6498,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Recordare Jesu pie,"
6499,EDDI'S SERVICE,"Quod sum causa Tuae viae,"
6500,EDDI'S SERVICE,Ne me perdas ill√¢ die!'
6501,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6502,EDDI'S SERVICE,There was no more. They moved out into the centre-aisle.
6503,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6504,EDDI'S SERVICE,''That you?' the Lady called as she shut the lid. 'I thought I heard
6505,EDDI'S SERVICE,"you, and I played it on purpose.'"
6506,EDDI'S SERVICE,
6507,EDDI'S SERVICE,"'Thank you awfully,' said Dan. 'We hoped you would, so we waited. Come"
6508,EDDI'S SERVICE,"on, Una, it's pretty nearly dinner-time.'"

6695,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"She flashed her lantern towards the spot, and in its circle of light"
6696,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,they saw a Guy Fawkes-looking man in a black cloak and a steeple-crowned
6697,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"hat, walking down the path beside Puck. They ran to meet him, and the"
6698,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,man said something to them about _rooms_ in their head. After a time
6699,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,they understood he was warning them not to catch colds.
6700,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6701,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'You've a bit of a cold yourself, haven't you?' said Una, for he ended"
6702,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,all his sentences with a consequential cough. Puck laughed.
6703,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6704,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Child,' the man answered, 'if it hath pleased Heaven to afflict me with"
6705,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,an infirmity----'
6706,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6707,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Nay, nay,' Puck struck in, 'the maid spoke out of kindness. _I_ know"
6708,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,that half your cough is but a catch to trick the vulgar; and that's a
6709,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"pity. There's honesty enough in you, Nick, without rasping and hawking.'"
6710,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6711,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Good people'--the man shrugged his lean shoulders--'the vulgar crowd
6712,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,love not truth unadorned. Wherefore we philosophers must needs dress her
6713,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,to catch their eye or--ahem!--their ear.'
6714,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6715,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'And what d'you think of _that_?' said Puck solemnly to Dan.
6716,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6717,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'I don't know,' he answered. 'It sounds like lessons.'"
6718,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6719,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Ah--well! There have been worse men than Nick Culpeper to take lessons
6720,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"from. Now, where can we sit that's not indoors?'"
6721,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6722,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'In the hay-mow, next to old Middenboro,' Dan suggested. '_He_ doesn't"
6723,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,mind.'
6724,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6725,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Eh?' Mr. Culpeper was stooping over the pale hellebore blooms by the
6726,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"light of Una's lamp. 'Does Master Middenboro need my poor services,"
6727,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,then?'
6728,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6729,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Save him, no!' said Puck. 'He is but a horse--next door to an ass, as"
6730,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,you'll see presently. Come!'
6731,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6732,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Their shadows jumped and slid on the fruit-tree walls. They filed out of
6733,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the garden by the snoring pig-pound and the crooning hen-house, to the"
6734,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,shed where Middenboro the old lawn-mower pony lives. His friendly eyes
6735,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,showed green in the light as they set their lamps down on the chickens'
6736,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"drinking-trough outside, and pushed past to the hay-mow. Mr. Culpeper"
6737,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,stooped at the door.
6738,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6739,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Mind where you lie,' said Dan. 'This hay's full of hedge-brishings.'"
6740,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6741,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'In! in!' said Puck. 'You've lain in fouler places than this, Nick. Ah!"
6742,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Let us keep touch with the stars!' He kicked open the top of the half
6743,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"door, and pointed to the clear sky. 'There be the planets you conjure"
6744,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,with! What does your wisdom make of that wandering and variable star
6745,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,behind those apple boughs?'
6746,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6747,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,The children smiled. A bicycle that they knew well was being walked down
6748,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,the steep lane.
6749,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6750,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Where?' Mr. Culpeper leaned forward quickly. 'That? Some countryman's
6751,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,lantern.'
6752,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6753,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Wrong, Nick,' said Puck. ''Tis a singular bright star in Virgo,"
6754,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"declining towards the house of Aquarius the water-carrier, who hath"
6755,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"lately been afflicted by Gemini. Aren't I right, Una?'"
6756,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6757,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Mr. Culpeper snorted contemptuously.
6758,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6759,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'No. It's the village nurse going down to the Mill about some fresh
6760,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"twins that came there last week. Nurse,' Una called, as the light"
6761,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"stopped on the flat, 'when can I see the Morris twins? And how are"
6762,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,they?'
6763,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6764,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Next Sunday, perhaps. Doing beautifully,' the Nurse called back, and"
6765,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,with a _ping-ping-ping_ of the bell brushed round the corner.
6766,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6767,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Her Uncle's a vetinary surgeon near Banbury,' Una explained, 'and if"
6768,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"you ring her bell at night, it rings right beside her bed--not"
6769,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,downstairs at all. Then she jumps up--she always keeps a pair of dry
6770,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"boots in the fender, you know--and goes anywhere she's wanted. We help"
6771,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,her bicycle through gaps sometimes. Most of her babies do beautifully.
6772,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,She told us so herself.'
6773,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6774,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'I doubt not, then, that she reads in my books,' said Mr. Culpeper"
6775,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"quietly. 'Twins at the Mill!' he muttered half aloud. '""And again He"
6776,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"sayeth, Return, ye children of men.""'"
6777,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6778,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Are you a doctor or a rector?' Una asked, and Puck with a shout turned"
6779,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,head over heels in the hay. But Mr. Culpeper was quite serious. He told
6780,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,them that he was a physician-astrologer--a doctor who knew all about the
6781,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"stars as well as all about herbs for medicine. He said that the sun, the"
6782,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"moon, and five Planets, called Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, and"
6783,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Venus, governed everybody and everything in the world. They all lived in"
6784,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Houses--he mapped out some of them against the dark with a busy
6785,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,forefinger--and they moved from House to House like pieces at draughts;
6786,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,and they went loving and hating each other all over the skies. If you
6787,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"knew their likes and dislikes, he said, you could make them cure your"
6788,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"patient and hurt your enemy, and find out the secret causes of things."
6789,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"He talked of these five Planets as though they belonged to him, or as"
6790,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,though he were playing long games against them. The children burrowed in
6791,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the hay up to their chins, and looked out over the half door at the"
6792,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"solemn, star-powdered sky till they seemed to be falling upside down"
6793,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"into it, while Mr. Culpeper talked about 'trines' and 'oppositions' and"
6794,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'conjunctions' and 'sympathies' and 'antipathies' in a tone that just
6795,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,matched things.
6796,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6797,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"A rat ran between Middenboro's feet, and the old pony stamped."
6798,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6799,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Mid hates rats,' said Dan, and passed him over a lock of hay. 'I wonder"
6800,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,why.'
6801,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6802,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Divine Astrology tells us,' said Mr. Culpeper. 'The horse, being a"
6803,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"martial beast that beareth man to battle, belongs naturally to the red"
6804,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"planet Mars--the Lord of War. I would show you him, but he's too near"
6805,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"his setting. Rats and mice, doing their businesses by night, come under"
6806,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the dominion of our Lady the Moon. Now between Mars and Luna, the one"
6807,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"red, t'other white, the one hot, t'other cold and so forth, stands, as I"
6808,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"have told you, a natural antipathy, or, as you say, hatred. Which"
6809,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"antipathy their creatures do inherit. Whence, good people, you may both"
6810,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,see and hear your cattle stamp in their stalls for the self-same causes
6811,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,as decree the passages of the stars across the unalterable face of
6812,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Heaven! Ahem!'
6813,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6814,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Puck lay along chewing a leaf. They felt him shake with laughter, and"
6815,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Mr. Culpeper sat up stiffly.
6816,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6817,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'I myself,' said he, 'have saved men's lives, and not a few neither, by"
6818,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"observing at the proper time--there is a time, mark you, for all things"
6819,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"under the sun--by observing, I say, so small a beast as a rat in"
6820,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,conjunction with so great a matter as this dread arch above us.' He
6821,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"swept his hand across the sky. 'Yet there are those,' he went on sourly,"
6822,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'who have years without knowledge.'
6823,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6824,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Right,' said Puck. 'No fool like an old fool.'"
6825,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6826,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Mr. Culpeper wrapped his cloak round him and sat still while the
6827,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,children stared at the Great Bear on the hill-top.
6828,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6829,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Give him time,' Puck whispered behind his hand. 'He turns like a"
6830,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,timber-tug--all of a piece.'
6831,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6832,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Ahem!' Mr. Culpeper said suddenly. 'I'll prove it to you. When I was
6833,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"physician to Saye's Horse, and fought the King--or rather the man"
6834,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Charles Stuart--in Oxfordshire (I had _my_ learning at Cambridge), the"
6835,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,plague was very hot all around us. I saw it at close hands. He who says
6836,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"I am ignorant of the plague, for example, is altogether beside the"
6837,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,bridge.'
6838,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6839,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'We grant it,' said Puck solemnly. 'But why talk of the plague this rare"
6840,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,night?'
6841,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6842,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'To prove my argument. This Oxfordshire plague, good people, being"
6843,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"generated among rivers and ditches, was of a werish, watery nature."
6844,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Therefore it was curable by drenching the patient in cold water, and"
6845,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"laying him in wet cloths; or at least, so I cured some of them. Mark"
6846,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,this. It bears on what shall come after.'
6847,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6848,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Mark also, Nick,' said Puck, 'that we are not your College of"
6849,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Physicians, but only a lad and a lass and a poor lubberkin. Therefore be"
6850,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"plain, old Hyssop on the Wall!'"
6851,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6852,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'To be plain and in order with you, I was shot in the chest while"
6853,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"gathering of betony from a brookside near Thame, and was took by the"
6854,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"King's men before their Colonel, one Blagg or Bragge, whom I warned"
6855,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,honestly that I had spent the week past among our plague-stricken. He
6856,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"flung me off into a cowshed, much like this here, to die, as I"
6857,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,supposed; but one of their priests crept in by night and dressed my
6858,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,wound. He was a Sussex man like myself.'
6859,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6860,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Who was that?' said Puck suddenly. 'Zack Tutshom?'
6861,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6862,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'No, Jack Marget,' said Mr. Culpeper."
6863,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6864,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Jack Marget of New College? The little merry man that stammered so? Why
6865,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,a plague was stuttering Jack at Oxford then?' said Puck.
6866,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6867,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'He had come out of Sussex in hope of being made a Bishop when the King
6868,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"should have conquered the rebels, as he styled us Parliament men. His"
6869,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"College had lent the King some monies too, which they never got again,"
6870,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,no more than simple Jack got his bishopric. When we met he had had a
6871,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"bitter bellyful of King's promises, and wished to return to his wife and"
6872,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"babes. This came about beyond expectation, for, so soon as I could stand"
6873,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"of my wound the man Blagge made excuse that I had been among the plague,"
6874,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"and Jack had been tending me, to thrust us both out from their camp. The"
6875,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"King had done with Jack now that Jack's College had lent the money, and"
6876,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Blagge's physician could not abide me because I would not sit silent and
6877,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,see him butcher the sick. (He was a College of Physicians man!) So
6878,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Blagge, I say, thrust us both out, with many vile words, for a pair of"
6879,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"pestilent, prating, pragmatical rascals.'"
6880,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6881,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Ha! Called _you_ pragmatical, Nick?' Puck started up. 'High time Oliver"
6882,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,came to purge the land! How did you and honest Jack fare next?'
6883,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6884,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'We were in some sort constrained to each other's company. I was for
6885,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"going to my house in Spitalfields, he would go to his parish in Sussex;"
6886,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"but the plague was broke out and spreading through Wiltshire, Berkshire,"
6887,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"and Hampshire, and he was so mad distracted to think that it might even"
6888,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,then be among his folks at home that I bore him company. He had
6889,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,comforted me in my distress. I could not have done less; and I
6890,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"remembered that I had a cousin at Great Wigsell, near by Jack's parish."
6891,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Thus we footed it from Oxford, cassock and buff coat together, resolute"
6892,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,to leave wars on the left side henceforth; and either through our mean
6893,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"appearances, or the plague making men less cruel, we were not hindered."
6894,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,To be sure they put us in the stocks one half-day for rogues and
6895,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"vagabonds at a village under St. Leonard's forest, where, as I have"
6896,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"heard, nightingales never sing; but the constable very honestly gave me"
6897,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"back my Astrological Almanac, which I carry with me.' Mr. Culpeper"
6898,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,tapped his thin chest. 'I dressed a whitlow on his thumb. So we went
6899,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,forward.

6901,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Not to trouble you with impertinences, we fetched over against Jack"
6902,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Marget's parish in a storm of rain about the day's end. Here our roads
6903,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"divided, for I would have gone on to my cousin at Great Wigsell, but"
6904,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"while Jack was pointing me out his steeple, we saw a man lying drunk, as"
6905,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"he conceived, athwart the road. He said it would be one Hebden, a"
6906,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"parishioner, and till then a man of good life; and he accused himself"
6907,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"bitterly for an unfaithful shepherd, that had left his flock to follow"
6908,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"princes. But I saw it was the plague, and not the beginnings of it"
6909,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"neither. They had set out the plague-stone, and the man's head lay on"
6910,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,it.'
6911,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6912,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'What's a plague-stone?' Dan whispered.
6913,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6914,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'When the plague is so hot in a village that the neighbours shut the
6915,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"roads against 'em, people set a hollowed stone, pot, or pan, where such"
6916,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,as would purchase victual from outside may lay money and the paper of
6917,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"their wants, and depart. Those that would sell come later--what will a"
6918,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"man not do for gain?--snatch the money forth, and leave in exchange such"
6919,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,goods as their conscience reckons fair value. I saw a silver groat in
6920,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the water, and the man's list of what he would buy was rain-pulped in"
6921,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,his wet hand.
6922,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6923,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""My wife! Oh, my wife and babes!"" says Jack of a sudden, and makes"

6929,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""Sweetheart!"" says Jack. ""Must I avoid thee?"" and she leaps at him and"

6953,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'But the plague was here,' Mr. Culpeper answered, and pointed up the"

6963,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'And now, good people, give me leave to be particular in this case. The"

6968,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,they sell forage to the carters; extreme hot in both Mills along the
6969,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"river, and scatteringly in other places, _except_, mark you, at the"

6972,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,There was no plague in the smithy at Munday's Lane----'
6973,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6974,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Munday's Lane? You mean our village? I thought so when you talked about
6975,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the two Mills,' cried Dan. 'Where did we put the plague-stone? I'd like"
6976,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,to have seen it.'
6977,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6978,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Then look at it now,' said Puck, and pointed to the chickens'"
6979,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"drinking-trough where they had set their bicycle lamps. It was a rough,"
6980,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"oblong stone pan, rather like a small kitchen sink, which Phillips, who"
6981,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"never wastes anything, had found in a ditch and had used for his"
6982,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,precious hens.
6983,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6984,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'That?' said Dan and Una, and stared, and stared, and stared."
6985,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6986,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Mr. Culpeper made impatient noises in his throat and went on.
6987,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6988,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'I am at these pains to be particular, good people, because I would have"
6989,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"you follow, so far as you may, the operations of my mind. That plague"
6990,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,which I told you I had handled outside Wallingford in Oxfordshire was of
6991,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"a watery nature, conformable to the brookish riverine country it bred"
6992,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"in, and curable, as I have said, by drenching in water. This plague of"
6993,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"ours here, for all that it flourished along watercourses--every soul at"
6994,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"both Mills died of it,--could not be so handled. Which brought me to a"
6995,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,stand. Ahem!'
6996,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6997,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'And your sick people in the meantime?' Puck demanded.
6998,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
6999,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'We persuaded them on the north side of the street to lie out in
7000,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Hitheram's field. Where the plague had taken one, or at most two, in a"
7001,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"house, folk would not shift for fear of thieves in their absence. They"
7002,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,cast away their lives to die among their goods.'
7003,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7004,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Human nature,' said Puck. 'I've seen it time and again. How did your"
7005,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,sick do in the fields?'
7006,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7007,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'They died not near so thick as those that kept within doors, and even"
7008,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,then they died more out of distraction and melancholy than plague. But I
7009,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"confess, good people, I could not in any sort master the sickness, or"
7010,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"come at a glimmer of its nature or governance. To be brief, I was flat"
7011,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"bewildered at the brute malignity of the disease, and so--did what I"
7012,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,should have done before--dismissed all conjectures and apprehensions
7013,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"that had grown up within me, chose a good hour by my Almanac, clapped my"
7014,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"vinegar-cloth to my face, and entered some empty houses, resigned to"
7015,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,wait upon the stars for guidance.'
7016,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7017,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'At night? Were you not horribly frightened?' said Puck.
7018,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7019,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'I dared to hope that the God who hath made man so nobly curious to
7020,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,search out His mysteries might not destroy a devout seeker. In due
7021,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"time--there is a time, as I have said, for everything under the sun--I"
7022,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"spied a whitish rat, very puffed and scabby, which sat beneath the"
7023,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,dormer of an attic through which shined our Lady the Moon. Whilst I
7024,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"looked on him--and her--she was moving towards old cold Saturn, her"
7025,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"ancient ally--the rat creeped languishingly into her light, and there,"
7026,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"before my eyes, died. Presently his mate or companion came out, laid him"
7027,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"down beside there, and in like fashion died too. Later--an hour or less"
7028,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,to midnight--a third rat did e'en the same; always choosing the
7029,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"moonlight to die in. This threw me into an amaze, since, as we know, the"
7030,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"moonlight is favourable, not hurtful, to the creatures of the Moon; and"
7031,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Saturn, being friends with her, as you would say, was hourly"
7032,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,strengthening her evil influence. Yet these three rats had been stricken
7033,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,dead in very moonlight. I leaned out of the window to see which of
7034,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Heaven's host might be on our side, and there beheld I good trusty Mars,"
7035,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"very red and heated, bustling about his setting. I straddled the roof to"
7036,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,see better.
7037,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7038,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Jack Marget came up street going to comfort our sick in Hitheram's
7039,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,field. A tile slipped under my foot.

7041,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Says he heavily enough, ""Watchman, what of the night?"""
7042,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7043,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"""Heart up, Jack,"" says I. ""Methinks there's one fighting for us that,"
7044,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"like a fool, I've forgot all this summer."" My meaning was naturally the"

7047,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""Pray to Him then,"" says he. ""I forgot Him too this summer."""

7049,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'He meant God, whom he always bitterly accused himself of having"
7050,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"forgotten up in Oxfordshire, among the King's men. I called down that he"
7051,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"had made amends enough for his sin by his work among the sick, but he"
7052,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,said he would not believe so till the plague was lifted from 'em. He was
7053,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,at his strength's end--more from melancholy than any just cause. I have
7054,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,seen this before among priests and over-cheerful men. I drenched him
7055,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"then and there with a half cup of waters, which I do not say cure the"
7056,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"plague, but are excellent against heaviness of the spirits.'"
7057,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7058,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'What were they?' said Dan.
7059,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7060,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'White brandy rectified, camphor, cardamoms, ginger, two sorts of"
7061,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"pepper, and aniseed.'"
7062,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7063,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Whew!' said Puck. 'Waters you call 'em!'
7064,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7065,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Jack coughed on it valiantly, and went down hill with me. I was for the"
7066,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Lower Mill in the valley, to note the aspect of the Heavens. My mind had"
7067,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"already shadowed forth the reason, if not the remedy, for our troubles,"
7068,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,but I would not impart it to the vulgar till I was satisfied. That
7069,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"practice may be perfect, judgment ought to be sound, and to make"
7070,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,judgment sound is required an exquisite knowledge. Ahem! I left Jack and
7071,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,his lantern among the sick in Hitheram's field. He still maintained the
7072,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"prayers of the so-called Church, which were rightly forbidden by"
7073,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Cromwell.'
7074,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7075,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'You should have told your cousin at Wigsell,' said Puck, 'and Jack"
7076,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"would have been fined for it, and you'd have had half the money. How did"
7077,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"you come so to fail in your duty, Nick?'"
7078,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7079,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Mr. Culpeper laughed--his only laugh that evening--and the children
7080,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,jumped at the loud neigh of it.
7081,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7082,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'We were not fearful of _men's_ judgment in those days,' he answered."
7083,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Now mark me closely, good people, for what follows will be to you,"
7084,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"though not to me, remarkable. When I reached the empty Mill, old Saturn,"
7085,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"low down in the House of the Fishes, threatened the Sun's rising-place."
7086,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Our Lady the Moon was moving towards the help of him (understand, I"
7087,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"speak astrologically). I looked abroad upon the high Heavens, and I"
7088,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,prayed the Maker of 'em for guidance. Now Mars sparklingly withdrew
7089,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"himself below the sky. On the instant of his departure, which I noted, a"
7090,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,bright star or vapour leaped forth above his head (as though he had
7091,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"heaved up his sword), and broke all about in fire. The cocks crowed"
7092,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"midnight through the valley, and I sat me down by the mill-wheel,"
7093,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"chewing spearmint (though that's a herb of Venus), and calling myself"
7094,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,all the asses' heads in the world! 'Twas plain enough _now_!'
7095,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7096,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'What was plain?' said Una.
7097,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7098,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'The true cause and cure of the plague. Mars, good fellow, had fought"
7099,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"for us to the uttermost. Faint though he had been in the Heavens, and"
7100,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"this had made me overlook him in my computations, he more than any of"
7101,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the other planets had kept the Heavens--which is to say, had been"
7102,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,visible some part of each night wellnigh throughout the year. Therefore
7103,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"his fierce and cleansing influence, warring against the Moon, had"
7104,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"stretched out to kill those three rats under my nose, and under the nose"
7105,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"of their natural mistress, the Moon. I had known Mars lean half across"
7106,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Heaven to deal our Lady the Moon some shrewd blow from under his shield,"
7107,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,but I had never before seen his strength displayed so effectual.'
7108,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7109,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'I don't understand a bit. Do you mean Mars killed the rats because he
7110,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,hated the Moon?' said Una.
7111,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7112,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'_That_ is as plain as the pikestaff with which Blagge's men pushed me
7113,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"forth,' Mr. Culpeper answered. 'I'll prove it. Why had the plague not"
7114,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"broken out at the blacksmith's shop in Munday's Lane? Because, as I've"
7115,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"shown you, forges and smithies belong naturally to Mars, and, for his"
7116,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"honour's sake, Mars 'ud keep 'em clean from the creatures of the Moon."
7117,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"But was it like, think you, that he'd come down and rat-catch in general"
7118,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"for lazy, ungrateful mankind? That were working a willing horse to"
7119,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,death. So then you can see that the meaning of the blazing star above
7120,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"him when he set was simply this: ""Destroy and burn the creatures of the"
7121,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Moon, for they are at the root of your trouble. And thus, having shown"
7122,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"you a taste of my power, good people, adieu.""'"
7123,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7124,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'Did Mars really say all that?' Una whispered.
7125,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7126,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Yes, and twice so much as that to any one who had ears to hear."
7127,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Briefly, he enlightened me that the plague was spread by the creatures"
7128,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"of the Moon. The Moon, our Lady of Ill-aspect, was the offender. My own"
7129,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"poor wits showed me that I, Nick Culpeper, had the people in my charge,"
7130,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"God's good providence aiding me, and no time to lose neither."
7131,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7132,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'I posted up the hill, and broke into Hitheram's field amongst 'em all"
7133,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,at prayers.
7134,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7135,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""Eureka, good people!"" I cried, and cast down a dead mill-rat which I'd"
7136,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"found. ""Here's your true enemy, revealed at last by the stars."""
7137,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7138,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""Nay, but I'm praying,"" says Jack. His face was as white as washed"
7139,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,silver.
7140,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7141,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""There's a time for everything under the sun,"" says I. ""If you would"
7142,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"stay the plague, take and kill your rats."""
7143,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7144,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""Oh, mad, stark mad!"" says he, and wrings his hands."
7145,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7146,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'A fellow lay in the ditch beside him, who bellows that he'd as soon die"
7147,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,mad hunting rats as be preached to death on a cold fallow. They laughed
7148,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"round him at this, but Jack Marget falls on his knees, and very"
7149,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,presumptuously petitions that he may be appointed to die to save the
7150,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,rest of his people. This was enough to thrust 'em back into their
7151,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,melancholy.
7152,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7153,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""You are an unfaithful shepherd, Jack,"" I says. ""Take a bat"" (which we"
7154,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"call a stick in Sussex) ""and kill a rat if you die before sunrise."
7155,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Twill save your people."""
7156,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7157,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'""Aye, aye. Take a bat and kill a rat,"" he says ten times over, like a"
7158,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"child, which moved 'em to ungovernable motions of that hysterical"
7159,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"passion before mentioned, so that they laughed all, and at least warmed"
7160,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,their chill bloods at that very hour--one o'clock or a little
7161,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,after--when the fires of life burn lowest. Truly there is a time for
7162,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,everything; and the physician must work with it--ahem!--or miss his
7163,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"cure. To be brief with you, I persuaded 'em, sick or sound, to have at"
7164,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,the whole generation of rats throughout the village. And there's a
7165,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"reason for all things too, though the wise physician need not blab 'em"
7166,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"all. _Imprimis_, or firstly, the mere sport of it, which lasted ten"
7167,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"days, drew 'em most markedly out of their melancholy. I'd defy sorrowful"
7168,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Job himself to lament or scratch while he's routing rats from a rick.
7169,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"_Secundo_, or secondly, the vehement act and operation of this chase or"
7170,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"war opened their skins to generous transpiration--more vulgarly,"
7171,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,sweated 'em handsomely; and this further drew off their black bile--the
7172,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"mother of sickness. Thirdly, when we came to burn the bodies of the"
7173,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"rats, I sprinkled sulphur on the faggots, whereby the onlookers were as"
7174,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,handsomely suffumigated. This I could not have compassed if I had made
7175,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,it a mere physician's business; they'd have thought it some conjuration.
7176,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Yet more, we cleansed, limed, and burned out a hundred foul poke-holes,"
7177,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"sinks, slews, and corners of unvisited filth in and about the houses in"
7178,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the village, and by good fortune (mark here that Mars was in opposition"
7179,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,to Venus) burned the corn-chandler's shop to the ground. Mars loves not
7180,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Venus. Will Noakes the saddler dropped his lantern on a truss of straw
7181,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,while he was rat-hunting there.'
7182,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7183,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Had ye given Will any of that gentle cordial of yours, Nick, by any"
7184,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,chance?' said Puck.
7185,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7186,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'A glass--or two glasses--not more. But as I would say, in fine, when we"
7187,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"had killed the rats, I took ash, slag, and charcoal from the smithy, and"
7188,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,burnt earth from the brickyard (I reason that a brickyard belongs to
7189,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"Mars), and rammed it with iron crowbars into the rat-runs and buries,"
7190,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,and beneath all the house floors. The Creatures of the Moon hate all
7191,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,that Mars hath used for his own clean ends. For example--rats bite not
7192,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,iron.'
7193,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7194,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'And how did poor stuttering Jack endure it?' said Puck.
7195,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7196,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'He sweated out his melancholy through his skin, and catched a loose"
7197,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"cough, which I cured with electuaries, according to art. It is"
7198,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"noteworthy, were I speaking among my equals, that the venom of the"
7199,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"plague translated, or turned itself into, and evaporated, or went away"
7200,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"as, a very heavy hoarseness and thickness of the head, throat, and"
7201,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,chest. (Observe from my books which planets govern these portions of
7202,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"man's body, and your darkness, good people, shall be illuminated--ahem!)"
7203,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"None the less, the plague, _qua_ plague, ceased and took off (for we"
7204,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"only lost three more, and two of 'em had it already on 'em) from the"
7205,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,morning of the day that Mars enlightened me by the Lower Mill.' He
7206,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,coughed--almost trumpeted--triumphantly.
7207,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7208,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'It is proved,' he jerked out. 'I say I have proved my contention, which"
7209,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"is, that by Divine Astrology and humble search into the veritable causes"
7210,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,of things--at the proper time--the sons of wisdom may combat even the
7211,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,plague.'
7212,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7213,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'H'm!' Puck replied. 'For my own part I hold that a simple soul----'
7214,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7215,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Mine?--simple, forsooth?' said Mr. Culpeper."
7216,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7217,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'A very simple soul, a high courage tempered with sound and stubborn"
7218,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"conceit, is stronger than all the stars in their courses. So I confess"
7219,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"truly that you saved the village, Nick.'"
7220,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7221,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'I stubborn? I stiff-necked? I ascribed all my poor success, under God's"
7222,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"good providence, to Divine Astrology. Not to me the glory! You talk as"
7223,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,that dear weeping ass Jack Marget preached before I went back to my work
7224,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"in Red Lion House, Spitalfields."
7225,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7226,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'Oh! Stammering Jack preached, did he? They say he loses his stammer in"
7227,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,the pulpit.'
7228,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7229,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'And his wits with it. He delivered a most idolatrous discourse when the
7230,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"plague was stayed. He took for his text: ""The wise man that delivered"
7231,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"the city."" I could have given him a better, such as: ""There is a time"
7232,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"for----""'"
7233,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7234,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'But what made you go to church to hear him?' Puck interrupted. 'Wail

7236,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7237,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,Mr. Culpeper wriggled uneasily.
7238,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,
7239,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"'The vulgar,' said he, 'the old crones and--ahem--the children, Alison"
7240,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"and the others, they dragged me to the House of Rimmon by the hand. I"
7241,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,was in two minds to inform on Jack for maintaining the mummeries of the
7242,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,"falsely called Church, which, I'll prove to you, are founded merely on"

7267,AN ASTROLOGER'S SONG,'What? What?' They both leaned forward across the half-door. It could

7390,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Simple Simon
7391,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7392,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7393,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Cattiwow came down the steep lane with his five-horse timber-tug. He
7394,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,stopped by the woodlump at the back gate to take off the brakes. His
7395,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"real name was Brabon, but the first time the children met him, years and"
7396,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"years ago, he told them he was 'carting wood,' and it sounded so exactly"
7397,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,like 'cattiwow' that they never called him anything else.
7398,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7399,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Hi!' Una shouted from the top of the woodlump, where they had been"
7400,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,watching the lane. 'What are you doing? Why weren't we told?'
7401,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7402,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'They've just sent for me,' Cattiwow answered. 'There's a middlin' big"
7403,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"log sticked in the dirt at Rabbit Shaw, and'--he flicked his whip back"
7404,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,along the line--'so they've sent for us all.'
7405,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7406,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Dan and Una threw themselves off the woodlump almost under black
7407,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Sailor's nose. Cattiwow never let them ride the big beam that makes the
7408,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"body of the timber-tug, but they hung on behind while their teeth"
7409,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,thuttered.
7410,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7411,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"The wood road beyond the brook climbs at once into the woods, and you"
7412,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"see all the horses' backs rising, one above another, like moving"
7413,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"stairs. Cattiwow strode ahead in his sackcloth woodman's petticoat,"
7414,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,belted at the waist with a leather strap; and when he turned and
7415,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"grinned, his red lips showed under his sackcloth-coloured beard. His cap"
7416,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"was sackcloth too, with a flap behind, to keep twigs and bark out of his"
7417,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,neck. He navigated the tug among pools of heather-water that splashed in
7418,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"their faces, and through clumps of young birches that slashed at their"
7419,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"legs, and when they hit an old toadstooled stump, they never knew"
7420,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"whether it would give way in showers of rotten wood, or jar them back"
7421,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,again.
7422,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7423,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,At the top of Rabbit Shaw half-a-dozen men and a team of horses stood
7424,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,round a forty-foot oak log in a muddy hollow. The ground about was
7425,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"poached and stoached with sliding hoof-marks, and a wave of dirt was"
7426,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,driven up in front of the butt.
7427,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7428,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'What did you want to bury her for this way?' said Cattiwow. He took his
7429,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,broad-axe and went up the log tapping it.
7430,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7431,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'She's sticked fast,' said 'Bunny' Lewknor, who managed the other team."
7432,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7433,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Cattiwow unfastened the five wise horses from the tug. They cocked their
7434,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"ears forward, looked, and shook themselves."
7435,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7436,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'I believe Sailor knows,' Dan whispered to Una."
7437,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7438,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'He do,' said a man behind them. He was dressed in flour sacks like the"
7439,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"others, and he leaned on his broad-axe, but the children, who knew all"
7440,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"the wood gangs, knew he was a stranger. In his size and oily hairiness"
7441,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"he might have been Bunny Lewknor's brother, except that his brown eyes"
7442,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"were as soft as a spaniel's, and his rounded black beard, beginning"
7443,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"close up under them, reminded Una of the walrus in _The Walrus and the"
7444,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Carpenter_.
7445,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7446,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Don't he just about know?' he said shyly, and shifted from one foot to"
7447,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,the other.
7448,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7449,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Yes. ""What Cattiwow can't get out of the woods must have roots growing"
7450,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"to her""'--Dan had heard old Hobden say this a few days before."
7451,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7452,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"At that minute Puck pranced up, picking his way through the pools of"
7453,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,black water in the ling.
7454,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7455,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Look _out_!' cried Una, jumping forward. 'He'll see you, Puck!'"
7456,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7457,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Me and Mus' Robin are pretty middlin' well acquainted,' the man"
7458,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,answered with a smile that made them forget all about walruses.
7459,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7460,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'This is Simon Cheyneys,' Puck began, and cleared his throat."
7461,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Shipbuilder of Rye Port; burgess of the said town, and the only----'"
7462,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7463,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Oh, look! Look ye! That's a knowing one,' said the man. Cattiwow had"
7464,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"fastened his team to the thin end of the log, and was moving them about"
7465,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"with his whip till they stood at right angles to it, heading downhill."
7466,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"Then he grunted. The horses took the strain, beginning with Sailor next"
7467,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"the log, like a tug-of-war team, and dropped almost to their knees. The"
7468,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"log shifted a nail's breadth in the clinging dirt, with the noise of a"
7469,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,giant's kiss.
7470,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7471,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'You're getting her!' Simon Cheyneys slapped his knee. 'Hing on! Hing
7472,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"on, lads, or she'll master ye! Ah!'"
7473,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7474,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Sailor's left hind hoof had slipped on a heather-tuft. One of the men
7475,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,whipped off his sack apron and spread it down. They saw Sailor feel for
7476,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"it, and recover. Still the log hung, and the team grunted in despair."
7477,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7478,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Hai!' shouted Cattiwow, and brought his dreadful whip twice across"
7479,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Sailor's loins with the crack of a shot-gun. The horse almost screamed
7480,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,as he pulled that extra last ounce which he did not know was in him. The
7481,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,thin end of the log left the dirt and rasped on dry gravel. The butt
7482,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"ground round like a buffalo in his wallow. Quick as an axe-cut, Lewknor"
7483,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"snapped on his five horses, and sliding, trampling, jingling, and"
7484,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"snorting, they had the whole thing out on the heather."
7485,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7486,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'Dat's the very first time I've knowed you lay into Sailor--to hurt
7487,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"him,' said Lewknor."
7488,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7489,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'It is,' said Cattiwow, and passed his hand over the two wheals. 'But"
7490,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,I'd ha' laid my own brother open at that pinch. Now we'll twitch her
7491,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,down the hill a piece--she lies just about right--and get her home by
7492,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"the low road. My team'll do it, Bunny; you bring the tug along. Mind"
7493,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,out!'
7494,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7495,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"He spoke to the horses, who tightened the chains. The great log half"
7496,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"rolled over, and slowly drew itself out of sight downhill, followed by"
7497,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,the wood gang and the timber-tug. In half a minute there was nothing to
7498,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"see but the deserted hollow of the torn-up dirt, the birch undergrowth"
7499,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"still shaking, and the water draining back into the hoof-prints."
7500,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7501,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Ye heard him?' Simon Cheyneys asked. 'He cherished his horse, but he'd"
7502,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,ha' laid him open in that pinch.'
7503,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7504,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Not for his own advantage,' said Puck quickly. ''Twas only to shift the"
7505,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,log.'
7506,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7507,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'I reckon every man born of woman has his log to shift in the world--if
7508,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,so be you're hintin' at any o' Frankie's doings. _He_ never hit beyond
7509,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"reason or without reason,' said Simon."
7510,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7511,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'_I_ never said a word against Frankie,' Puck retorted, with a wink at"
7512,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"the children. 'An' if I did, do it lie in your mouth to contest my"
7513,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"say-so, seeing how you----'"
7514,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7515,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Why don't it lie in my mouth, seeing I was the first which knowed"
7516,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Frankie for all he was?' The burly sack-clad man puffed down at cool
7517,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,little Puck.
7518,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7519,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Yes, and the first which set out to poison him--Frankie--on the high"
7520,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,seas----'
7521,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7522,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Simon's angry face changed to a sheepish grin. He waggled his immense
7523,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"hands, but Puck stood off and laughed mercilessly."
7524,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7525,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'But let me tell you, Mus' Robin,' he pleaded."
7526,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7527,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'I've heard the tale. Tell the children here. Look, Dan! Look,"
7528,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Una!'--Puck's straight brown finger levelled like an arrow. 'There's the
7529,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,only man that ever tried to poison Sir Francis Drake!'
7530,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7531,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Oh, Mus' Robin! Tidn't fair. You've the 'vantage of us all in your"
7532,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,upbringin's by hundreds o' years. 'Stands to nature you know all the
7533,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,tales against every one.'
7534,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7535,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"He turned his soft eyes so helplessly on Una that she cried, 'Stop"
7536,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"ragging him, Puck! You know he didn't really.'"
7537,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7538,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'I do. But why are you so sure, little maid?'"
7539,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7540,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Because--because he doesn't look like it,' said Una stoutly."
7541,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7542,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'I thank you,' said Simon to Una. 'I--I was always trustable like with"
7543,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"children if you let me alone, you double handful o' mischief!' He"
7544,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,pretended to heave up his axe on Puck; and then his shyness overtook him
7545,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,afresh.
7546,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7547,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Where did you know Sir Francis Drake?' said Dan, not relishing being"
7548,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,called a child.
7549,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7550,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'At Rye Port, to be sure,' said Simon, and seeing Dan's bewilderment,"
7551,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,repeated it.
7552,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7553,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Yes, but look here,' said Dan. 'Drake he was a Devon man. The song says"
7554,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,so.'
7555,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7556,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""_And_ ruled the Devon seas,""' Una went on. 'That's what I was"
7557,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,thinking--if you don't mind.'
7558,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7559,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"Simon Cheyneys seemed to mind very much indeed, for he swelled in"
7560,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,silence while Puck laughed.
7561,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7562,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Hutt!' he burst out at last, 'I've heard that talk too. If you listen"
7563,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"to them West Country folk, you'll listen to a pack o' lies. I believe"
7564,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"Frankie was born somewhere out west among the Shires, but his father had"
7565,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"to run for it when Frankie was a baby, because the neighbours was"
7566,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"wishful to kill him, d'ye see? He run to Chatham, old Parson Drake did,"
7567,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,an' Frankie was brought up in a old hulks of a ship moored in the Medway
7568,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"river, same as it might ha' been the Rother. Brought up _at_ sea, you"
7569,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"might say, before he could walk _on_ land--nigh Chatham in Kent. And"
7570,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,ain't Kent back-door to Sussex? And don't that make Frankie Sussex? O'
7571,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,course it do. Devon man! Bah! Those West Country boats they're always
7572,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,fishin' in other folks' water.'
7573,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7574,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'I beg your pardon,' said Dan. 'I'm sorry.'"
7575,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7576,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'No call to be sorry. You've been misled. I met Frankie at Rye Port when
7577,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"my Uncle, that was the shipbuilder there, pushed me off his wharf-edge"
7578,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,on to Frankie's ship. Frankie had put in from Chatham with his rudder
7579,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"splutted, and a man's arm--Moon's that 'ud be--broken at the tiller."
7580,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"""Take this boy aboard an' drown him,"" says my Uncle, ""and I'll mend your"
7581,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"rudder-piece for love.""'"
7582,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7583,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'What did your Uncle want you drowned for?' said Una.
7584,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7585,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'That was only his fashion of say-so, same as Mus' Robin. I'd a"
7586,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,foolishness in my head that ships could be builded out of iron.
7587,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Yes--iron ships! I'd made me a liddle toy one of iron plates beat out
7588,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"thin--and she floated a wonder! But my Uncle, bein' a burgess of Rye,"
7589,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"and a shipbuilder, he 'prenticed me to Frankie in the fetchin' trade, to"
7590,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,cure this foolishness.'
7591,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7592,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'What was the fetchin' trade?' Dan interrupted.
7593,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7594,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'Fetchin' poor Flemishers and Dutchmen out o' the Low Countries into
7595,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"England. The King o' Spain, d'ye see, he was burnin' 'em in those parts,"
7596,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"for to make 'em Papishers, so Frankie he fetched 'em away to _our_"
7597,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"parts, and a risky trade it was. His master wouldn't never touch it"
7598,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"while he lived, but he left his ship to Frankie when he died, and"
7599,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Frankie turned her into this fetchin' trade. Outrageous cruel hard
7600,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,work--on besom black nights bulting back and forth off they Dutch roads
7601,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"with shoals on all sides, and having to hark out for the"
7602,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,_frish-frish-frish_-like of a Spanish galliwopses' oars creepin' up on
7603,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"ye. Frankie 'ud have the tiller and Moon he'd peer forth at the bows,"
7604,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"our lantern under his skirts, till the boat we was lookin' for 'ud blurt"
7605,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"up out o' the dark, and we'd lay hold and haul aboard whoever"
7606,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'twas--man, woman, or babe,--an' round we'd go again, the wind bewling"
7607,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"like a kite in our riggin's, and they'd drop into the hold and praise"
7608,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,God for happy deliverance till they was all sick.
7609,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7610,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'I had nigh a year at it, an' we must have fetched off--oh, a hundred"
7611,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"pore folk, I reckon. Outrageous bold, too, Frankie growed to be."
7612,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Outrageous cunning he was. Once we was as near as nothing nipped by a
7613,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"tall ship off Tergo Sands in a snowstorm. She had the wind of us, and"
7614,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"spooned straight before it, shooting all bow guns. Frankie fled inshore"
7615,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"smack for the beach, till he was atop of the first breakers. Then he"
7616,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"hove his anchor out, which nigh tore our bows off, but it twitched us"
7617,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"round end-for-end into the wind, d'ye see, an' we clawed off them sands"
7618,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"like a drunk man rubbin' along a tavern bench. When we could see, the"
7619,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Spanisher was laid flat along in the breakers with the snows whitening
7620,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,on his wet belly. He thought he could go where Frankie went.'
7621,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7622,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'What happened to the crew?' said Una.
7623,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7624,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'We didn't stop,' Simon answered. 'There was a very liddle new baby in"
7625,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"our hold, and the mother, she wanted to get to some dry bed middlin'"
7626,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"quick. We runned into Dover, and said nothing.'"
7627,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7628,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'Was Sir Francis Drake very much pleased?'
7629,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7630,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Heart alive, maid, he'd no head to his name in those days. He was just"
7631,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"a outrageous, valiant, crop-haired, tutt-mouthed boy roarin' up an' down"
7632,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"the narrer seas, with his beard not yet quilled out. He made a"
7633,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"laughing-stock of everything all day, and he'd hold our lives in the"
7634,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,bight of his arm all the besom-black night among they Dutch sands; and
7635,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"we'd ha' jumped overside to behove him any one time, all of us.'"
7636,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7637,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Then why did you try to poison him?' Una asked wickedly, and Simon hung"
7638,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,his head like a shy child.
7639,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7640,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Oh, that was when he set me to make a pudden, for because our cook was"
7641,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"hurted. _I_ done my uttermost, but she all fetched adrift like in the"
7642,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"bag, an' the more I biled the bits of her, the less she favoured any"
7643,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"fashion o' pudden. Moon he chawed and chammed his piece, and Frankie"
7644,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"chawed and chammed his'n, and--no words to it--he took me by the ear an'"
7645,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"walked me out over the bow-end, an' him an' Moon hove the pudden at me"
7646,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"on the bowsprit gub by gub, something cruel hard!' Simon rubbed his"
7647,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,hairy cheek.
7648,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7649,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Nex' time you bring me anything,"" says Frankie, ""you bring me"
7650,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"cannon-shot an' I'll know what I'm getting."" But as for poisoning----' He"
7651,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"stopped, the children laughed so."
7652,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7653,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Of course you didn't,' said Una. 'Oh, Simon, we _do_ like you!'"
7654,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7655,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'I was always likeable with children.' His smile crinkled up through the
7656,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,hair round his eyes. 'Simple Simon they used to call me through our
7657,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,yard gates.'
7658,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7659,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'Did Sir Francis mock you?' Dan asked.
7660,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7661,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Ah, no. He was gentle-born. Laugh he did--he was always laughing--but"
7662,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,not so as to hurt a feather. An' I loved 'en. I loved 'en before England
7663,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"knew 'en, or Queen Bess she broke his heart.'"
7664,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7665,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'But he hadn't really done anything when you knew him, had he?' Una"
7666,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"insisted. 'Armadas and those things, I mean.'"
7667,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7668,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Simon pointed to the scars and scrapes left by Cattiwow's great log.
7669,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'You tell me that that good ship's timber never done nothing against
7670,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"winds and weathers since her upspringing, and I'll confess ye that young"
7671,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Frankie never done nothing neither. Nothing? He adventured and suffered
7672,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,and made shift on they Dutch sands _as_ much in any one month as ever he
7673,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,had occasion for to do in a half-year on the high seas afterwards. An'
7674,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,what was his tools? A coaster boat--a liddle box o' walty plankin' an'
7675,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,some few fathom feeble rope held together an' made able by _him_ sole.
7676,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,He drawed our spirits up in our bodies same as a chimney-towel draws a
7677,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"fire. 'Twas in him, and it comed out all times and shapes.'"
7678,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7679,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'I wonder did he ever 'magine what he was going to be? Tell himself
7680,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,stories about it?' said Dan with a flush.
7681,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7682,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'I expect so. We mostly do--even when we're grown. But bein' Frankie, he"
7683,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,took good care to find out beforehand what his fortune might be. Had I
7684,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"rightly ought to tell 'em this piece?' Simon turned to Puck, who"
7685,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,nodded.
7686,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7687,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'My mother, she was just a fair woman, but my Aunt, her sister, she had"
7688,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"gifts by inheritance laid up in her,' Simon began."
7689,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7690,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Oh, that'll never do,' cried Puck, for the children stared blankly. 'Do"
7691,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,you remember what Robin promised to the Widow Whitgift so long as her
7692,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,blood and get lasted?'[5]
7693,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7694,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,[5] See 'Dymchurch Flit' in _Puck of Pook's Hill_.
7695,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7696,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'Yes. There was always to be one of them that could see farther through
7697,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"a millstone than most,' Dan answered promptly."
7698,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7699,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Well, Simon's Aunt's mother,' said Puck slowly, 'married the Widow's"
7700,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"blind son on the Marsh, and Simon's Aunt was the one chosen to see"
7701,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,farthest through millstones. Do you understand?'
7702,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7703,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'That was what I was gettin' at,' said Simon, 'but you're so desperate"
7704,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,quick. My Aunt she knew what was coming to people. My Uncle being a
7705,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"burgess of Rye, he counted all such things odious, and my Aunt she"
7706,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"couldn't be got to practise her gifts hardly at all, because it hurted"
7707,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"her head for a week afterwards; but when Frankie heard she had 'em, he"
7708,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,was all for nothing till she foretold on him--till she looked in his
7709,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"hand to tell his fortune, d'ye see? One time we was at Rye she come"
7710,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"aboard with my other shirt and some apples, and he fair beazled the life"
7711,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,out of her about it.
7712,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7713,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Oh, you'll be twice wed, and die childless,"" she says, and pushes his"
7714,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,hand away.
7715,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7716,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""That's the woman's part,"" he says. ""What'll come to me--to me?"" an' he"
7717,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,thrusts it back under her nose.
7718,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7719,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Gold--gold, past belief or counting,"" she says. ""Let go 'o me, lad."""
7720,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7721,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Sink the gold!"" he says. ""What'll I _do_, mother?"" He coaxed her like"
7722,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,no woman could well withstand. I've seen him with 'em--even when they
7723,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,were sea-sick.
7724,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7725,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""If you _will_ have it,"" she says at last, ""you shall have it. You'll"
7726,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"do a many things, and eating and drinking with a dead man beyond the"
7727,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,world's end will be the least of them. For you'll open a road from the
7728,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"East unto the West, and back again, and you'll bury your heart with your"
7729,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"best friend by that road-side, and the road you open none shall shut so"
7730,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"long as you're let lie quiet in your grave.""[6]"
7731,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7732,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"[6] The old lady's prophecy is in a fair way to come true, for when the"
7733,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"Panama Canal is finished, one end of it will open into the very bay"
7734,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,where Sir Francis Drake was buried. Then ships will be taken through the
7735,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"Canal, and the road round Cape Horn which Sir Francis opened will be"
7736,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,abandoned.
7737,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7738,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""And if I'm not?"" he says."
7739,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7740,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Why then,"" she says, ""Sim's iron ships will be sailing on dry land."
7741,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"Now ha' done with this foolishness. Where's Sim's shirt?"""
7742,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7743,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'He couldn't fetch no more out of her, and when we come up from the"
7744,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"cabin, he stood mazed like by the tiller, playing with a apple."
7745,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7746,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""My Sorrow!"" says my Aunt; ""d'ye see that? The great world lying in his"

7750,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7751,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""To be sure,"" she says. ""'Tis just a apple,"" and she went ashore with"
7752,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,her hand to her head. It always hurted her to show her gifts.

7754,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"[Illustration: 'You'll open a road from the East unto the West, and back"
7755,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,again.'--P. 292.]
7756,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7757,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'Him and me puzzled over that talk plenty. It sticked in his mind
7758,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,quite extravagant. The very next time we slipped out for some fetchin'
7759,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"trade, we met Mus' Stenning's boat over by Calais sands; and he warned"
7760,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,us that the Spanishers had shut down all their Dutch ports against us
7761,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"English, and their galliwopses was out picking up our boats like flies"
7762,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"off hogs' backs. Mus' Stenning he runs for Shoreham, but Frankie held on"
7763,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"a piece, knowin' that Mus' Stenning was jealous of our good trade. Over"
7764,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"by Dunkirk a great gor-bellied Spanisher, with the Cross on his sails,"
7765,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,came rampin' at us. We left him. We left him all they bare seas to

7767,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7768,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Looks like this road was going to be shut pretty soon,"" says Frankie,"

7774,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""No odds,"" says Frankie, ""he'll have the inshore tide against him. Did"

7776,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7777,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Till my iron ships sailed dry land,"" I says."
7778,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7779,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""That's foolishness,"" he says. ""Who cares where Frankie Drake makes a"

7781,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7782,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'The Spanisher kept muckin' on more and more canvas. I told him so.
7783,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,

7812,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7813,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'The Spanisher gave us his broadside as he went about. They all fell
7814,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"short except one that smack-smooth hit the rail behind my back, an' I"

7816,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7817,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Be you hit anywhere to signify?"" he says. ""Come over to me."""
7818,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,

7821,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7822,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'Why? What had happened?' cried Dan and Una together.
7823,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7824,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'The rail had jarred me in here like.' Simon reached behind him
7825,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,clumsily. 'From my shoulders down I didn't act no shape. Frankie carried
7826,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"me piggy-back to my Aunt's house, and I lay bed-rid and tongue-tied"
7827,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"while she rubbed me day and night, month in and month out. She had faith"
7828,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"in rubbing with the hands. P'raps she put some of her gifts into it,"
7829,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"too. Last of all, something loosed itself in my pore back, and lo! I was"

7831,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7832,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Where's Frankie?"" I says, thinking I'd been a longish while abed."
7833,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7834,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Down-wind amongst the Dons--months ago,"" says my Aunt."
7835,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,

7837,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7838,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Your duty's to your town and trade now,"" says she. ""Your Uncle he died"

7844,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'""Maybe I do still,"" she says, ""but I'm a woman before I'm a Whitgift,"

7847,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7848,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'That's why I've never teched iron since that day--not to build a toy

7851,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7852,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Whitgift blood is terrible resolute--on the she-side,' said Puck."

7856,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'With one thing and another, and my being made a burgess of Rye, I never"

7859,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"shifts and passes he'd worked with beforetimes off they Dutch sands,"
7860,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"but, naturally, folk took more note of them. When Queen Bess made him"
7861,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"knight, he sent my Aunt a dried orange stuffed with spiceries to smell"
7862,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"to. She cried outrageous on it. She blamed herself for her foretellings,"
7863,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,having set him on his won'erful road; but I reckon he'd ha' gone that
7864,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,way all withstanding. Curious how close she foretelled it! The world in

7866,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Doughty----'
7867,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7868,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Never mind for Mus' Doughty,' Puck interrupted. 'Tell us where you met"
7869,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,Sir Francis next.'
7870,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7871,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'Oh, ha! That was the year I was made a burgess of Rye--the same year"
7872,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,which King Philip sent his ships to take England without Frankie's
7873,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,leave.'
7874,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7875,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,'The Armada!' said Dan contentedly. 'I was hoping that would come.'
7876,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,
7877,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,"'_I_ knowed Frankie would never let 'em smell London smoke, but plenty"
7878,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,good men in Rye was two-three minded about the upshot. 'Twas the noise
7879,THE THOUSANDTH MAN,of the gun-fire terrified us. The wind favoured it our way from off

8220,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,speckled with scarlet-lipped sprouting acorns. They worked their way by
8221,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"their own short cuts to the edge of Pound's Wood, and heard a horse's"
8222,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,feet just as they came to the beech where Ridley the keeper hangs up the
8223,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,vermin. The poor little fluffy bodies dangled from the branches--some
8224,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"perfectly good, but most of them dried to twisted strips."
8225,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8226,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Three more owls,' said Dan, counting. 'Two stoats, four jays, and a"
8227,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,kestrel. That's ten since last week. Ridley's a beast.'
8228,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8229,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'In my time this sort of tree bore heavier fruit.' Sir Richard
8230,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Dalyngridge[7] reined up his grey horse, Swallow, in the ride behind"
8231,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,them. 'What play do you make?' he asked.
8232,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8233,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,[7] This is the Norman knight they met the year before in _Puck of
8234,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Pook's Hill_. See 'Young Men at the Manor,' 'The Knights of the Joyous"
8235,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Venture,' and 'Old Men at Pevensey,' in that book."
8236,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8237,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Nothing, sir. We're looking for old Hobden,' Dan replied. 'He promised"
8238,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,to get us a sleeper.'
8239,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8240,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'Sleeper? A _dormeuse_ do you say?'
8241,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8242,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Yes, a dormouse, sir.'"
8243,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8244,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'I understand. I passed a woodman on the low grounds. Come!'
8245,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8246,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"He wheeled up the ride again, and pointed through an opening to the"
8247,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"patch of beech-stubs, chestnut, hazel, and birch that old Hobden would"
8248,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"turn into firewood, hop-poles, pea-boughs, and house-faggots before"
8249,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,spring. The old man was as busy as a beaver.
8250,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8251,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Something laughed beneath a thorn, and Puck stole out, his finger on his"
8252,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,lip.
8253,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8254,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'Look!' he whispered. 'Along between the spindle trees. Ridley has been
8255,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,there this half-hour.'
8256,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8257,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"The children followed his point, and saw Ridley the keeper in an old dry"
8258,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"ditch, watching Hobden as a cat watches a mouse."
8259,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8260,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'Huhh!' cried Una. 'Hobden always 'tends to his wires before breakfast.
8261,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,He puts his rabbits into the faggots he's allowed to take home. He'll
8262,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,tell us about 'em to-morrow.'
8263,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8264,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'We had the same breed in my day,' Sir Richard replied, and moved off"
8265,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"quietly, Puck at his bridle, the children on either side between the"
8266,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,close-trimmed beech stuff.
8267,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8268,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'What did you do to them?' said Dan, as they repassed Ridley's terrible"
8269,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,tree.
8270,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8271,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'That!' Sir Richard jerked his head toward the dangling owls.
8272,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8273,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Not he,' said Puck. 'There was never enough brute Norman in you to hang"
8274,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,a man for taking a buck.'
8275,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8276,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'I--I cannot abide to hear their widows screech. But why am I on
8277,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"horseback while you are afoot?' He dismounted lightly, tapped Swallow on"
8278,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"the chest, so that the wise thing backed instead of turning in the"
8279,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"narrow ride, and put himself at the head of the little procession. He"
8280,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,walked as though all the woods belonged to him. 'I have often told my
8281,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"friends,' he went on, 'that Red William the King was not the only Norman"
8282,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,found dead in a forest while he hunted.'
8283,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8284,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'D'you mean William Rufus?' said Dan.
8285,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8286,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Yes,' said Puck, kicking a clump of red toadstools off a dead log."
8287,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8288,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'For example, there was a knight new from Normandy,' Sir Richard went"
8289,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"on, 'to whom Henry our King granted a manor in Kent near by. He chose to"
8290,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,hang his forester's son the day before a deer-hunt that he gave to
8291,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,pleasure the King.'
8292,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8293,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Now when would that be?' said Puck, and scratched an ear thoughtfully."
8294,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8295,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'The summer of the year King Henry broke his brother Robert of Normandy
8296,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,at Tenchebrai fight. Our ships were even then at Pevensey loading for
8297,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,the war.'
8298,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8299,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'What happened to the knight?' Dan asked.
8300,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8301,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'They found him pinned to an ash, three arrows through his leather coat."
8302,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,_I_ should have worn mail that day.'
8303,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8304,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'And did you see him all bloody?' Dan continued.
8305,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8306,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Nay, I was with De Aquila at Pevensey, counting horse-shoes, and arrow"
8307,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"sheaves, and ale-barrels into the holds of the ships. The army only"
8308,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"waited for our King to lead them against Robert in Normandy, but he sent"
8309,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,word to De Aquila that he would hunt with him here before he set out for
8310,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,France.'
8311,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8312,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'Why did the King want to hunt so particularly?' Una demanded.
8313,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8314,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'If he had gone straight to France after the Kentish knight was killed,"
8315,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,men would have said he feared being slain like the knight. It was his
8316,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,duty to show himself debonair to his English people as it was De
8317,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,Aquila's duty to see that he took no harm while he did it. But it was a
8318,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"great burden! De Aquila, Hugh, and I ceased work on the ships, and"
8319,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,scoured all the Honour of the Eagle--all De Aquila's lands--to make a
8320,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"fit, and, above all, a safe sport for our King. Look!'"
8321,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8322,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"The ride twisted, and came out on the top of Pound's Hill Wood. Sir"
8323,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Richard pointed to the swells of beautiful, dappled Dallington, that"
8324,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,showed like a woodcock's breast up the valley. 'Ye know the forest?'
8325,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,said he.
8326,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8327,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'You ought to see the bluebells there in Spring!' said Una.
8328,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8329,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'I have seen,' said Sir Richard, gazing, and stretched out his hand."
8330,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'Hugh's work and mine was first to move the deer gently from all parts
8331,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"into Dallington yonder, and there to hold them till the King came. Next,"
8332,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,we must choose some three hundred beaters to drive the deer to the
8333,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,stands within bowshot of the King. Here was our trouble! In the mellay
8334,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,of a deer-drive a Saxon peasant and a Norman King may come over close to
8335,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,each other. The conquered do not love their conquerors all at once. So
8336,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"we needed sure men, for whom their village or kindred would answer in"
8337,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"life, cattle, and land if any harm come to the King. Ye see?'"
8338,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8339,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'If one of the beaters shot the King,' said Puck, 'Sir Richard wanted to"
8340,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,be able to punish that man's village. Then the village would take care
8341,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,to send a good man.'
8342,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8343,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'So! So it was. But, lest our work should be too easy, the King had done"
8344,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"such a dread justice over at Salehurst, for the killing of the Kentish"
8345,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"knight (twenty-six men he hanged, as I heard), that our folk were"
8346,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,half-mad with fear before we began. It is easier to dig out a badger
8347,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,gone to earth than a Saxon gone dumb-sullen. And atop of their misery
8348,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,the old rumour waked that Harold the Saxon was alive and would bring
8349,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,them deliverance from us Normans. This has happened every autumn since
8350,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,Senlac fight.'
8351,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8352,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'But King Harold was killed at Hastings,' said Una."
8353,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8354,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'So it was said, and so it was believed by us Normans, but our Saxons"
8355,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,always believed he would come again. _That_ rumour did not make our work
8356,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,any more easy.'
8357,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8358,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Sir Richard strode on down the far slope of the wood, where the trees"
8359,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,thin out. It was fascinating to watch how he managed his long spurs
8360,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,among the lumps of blackened ling.
8361,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8362,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'But we did it!' he said. 'After all, a woman is as good as a man to"
8363,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"beat the woods, and the mere word that deer are afoot makes cripples and"
8364,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,crones young again. De Aquila laughed when Hugh told him over the list
8365,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,of beaters. Half were women; and many of the rest were clerks--Saxon and
8366,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,Norman priests.
8367,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8368,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Hugh and I had not time to laugh for eight days, till De Aquila, as"
8369,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Lord of Pevensey, met our King and led him to the first shooting"
8370,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,stand--by the Mill on the edge of the forest. Hugh and I--it was no work
8371,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,for hot heads or heavy hands--lay with our beaters on the skirts of
8372,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,Dallington to watch both them and the deer. When De Aquila's great horn
8373,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"blew we went forward, a line half a league long. Oh, to see the fat"
8374,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"clerks, their gowns tucked up, puffing and roaring, and the sober"
8375,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"millers dusting the undergrowth with their staves; and, like as not,"
8376,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"between them a Saxon wench, hand in hand with her man, shrilling like a"
8377,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"kite as she ran, and leaping high through the fern, all for joy of the"
8378,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,sport.'
8379,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8380,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'_Ah! How! Ah! How! How-ah! Sa-how-ah!_' Puck bellowed without warning,"
8381,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"and Swallow bounded forward, ears cocked, and nostrils cracking."
8382,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8383,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'_Hal-lal-lal-lal-la-hai-ie!_' Sir Richard answered in a high clear
8384,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,shout.
8385,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8386,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"The two voices joined in swooping circles of sound, and a heron rose out"
8387,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"of a red osier bed below them, circling as though he kept time to the"
8388,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,outcry. Swallow quivered and swished his glorious tail. They stopped
8389,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,together on the same note.
8390,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8391,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,A hoarse shout answered them across the bare woods.
8392,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8393,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'That's old Hobden,' said Una."
8394,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8395,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Small blame to him. It is in his blood,' said Puck. 'Did your beaters"
8396,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"cry so, Sir Richard?'"
8397,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8398,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'My faith, they forgot all else. (Steady, Swallow, steady!) They forgot"
8399,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,where the King and his people waited to shoot. They followed the deer to
8400,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,the very edge of the open till the first flight of wild arrows from the
8401,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,stands flew fair over them.
8402,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8403,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'I cried, ""'Ware shot! 'Ware shot!"" and a knot of young knights new from"
8404,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"Normandy, that had strayed away from the Grand Stand, turned about, and"
8405,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"in mere sport loosed off at our line shouting: ""'Ware Senlac arrows!"
8406,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'Ware Senlac arrows!"" A jest, I grant you, but too sharp. One of our"
8407,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"beaters answered in Saxon: ""'Ware New Forest arrows! 'Ware Red William's"
8408,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"arrow!"" so I judged it time to end the jests, and when the boys saw my"
8409,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"old mail gown (for, to shoot with strangers _I_ count the same as war),"
8410,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"they ceased shooting. So _that_ was smoothed over, and we gave our"
8411,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,beaters ale to wash down their anger. They were excusable! We--they had
8412,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"sweated to show our guests good sport, and our reward was a flight of"
8413,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"hunting-arrows which no man loves, and worse, a churl's jibe over"
8414,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"hard-fought, fair-lost Hastings fight. So, before the next beat, Hugh"
8415,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"and I assembled and called the beaters over by name, to steady them. The"
8416,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"greater part we knew, but among the Netherfield men I saw an old, old"
8417,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"man, in the dress of a pilgrim."
8418,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8419,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,'The Clerk of Netherfield said he was well known by repute for twenty
8420,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,years as a witless man that journeyed without rest to all the shrines of
8421,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"England. The old man sits, Saxon fashion, head between fists. We Normans"
8422,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,rest our chin on our left palm.
8423,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8424,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'""Who answers for him?"" said I. ""If he fails in his duty, who will pay"
8425,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"his fine?"""
8426,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8427,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'""Who will pay my fine?"" the pilgrim said. ""I have asked that of all"

8429,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"days! They have not answered!"" When he lifted his thin face I saw he was"

8431,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,
8432,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"'""Nay but, Father,"" I said, ""to whom hast thou commended thyself?"" He"
8433,THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW,"shook his head, so I spoke in Saxon: ""Whose man art thou?"""
