95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,"In this new edition of ""The Classic Myths in English Literature"" the"
97,PREFACE,former order of materials has been altered in accordance with the
98,PREFACE,advice of the teachers who have had longest experience with the use of
99,PREFACE,the book; the old material has been thoroughly revised; and much new
100,PREFACE,material has been added. Since most people prefer to begin a story at
101,PREFACE,"its beginning, and not with the career of its author and his genealogy,"
102,PREFACE,I have reserved the history of the myths for the conclusion of the
103,PREFACE,text. Some of the myths have been restated in more careful form. Some
104,PREFACE,"short narratives, before omitted, have been included. The sketches"
105,PREFACE,of the Iliad and the Odyssey have been considerably expanded; and an
106,PREFACE,"outline--which, I hope, will be deemed adequate--of Wagner's version of"
107,PREFACE,the Ring of the Nibelung has been appended to the account of Norse and
108,PREFACE,"German mythology. That version is, of course, not English literature;"
109,PREFACE,but it has come to be received as the classic modern version of the
110,PREFACE,"story; and the story is needed, at some time or other, by every lover"
111,PREFACE,of music. Fresh examples of the employment of myth in English verse
112,PREFACE,"have, where practicable, been incorporated in the text; and some new"
113,PREFACE,references will be found in the Commentary.
114,PREFACE,
115,PREFACE,"I have thoroughly revised the list of illustrative cuts, have"
116,PREFACE,"interpreted the more difficult of the ancient figures, and indicated"
117,PREFACE,the sources. The pictures themselves are a decided improvement upon
118,PREFACE,those in the former edition. In the determination of sources for
119,PREFACE,"reproduction, I have had the valuable assistance of Dr. E. von Mach,"
120,PREFACE,the author of more than one well-known work on ancient art; and to
121,PREFACE,"him I am indebted, in addition, for the section on The Classic Myths"
122,PREFACE,"in Art, which is included in my Introduction. With this new equipment"
123,PREFACE,the book should prove more useful to those who here make their first
124,PREFACE,"acquaintance with art, especially the art of the ancients, as well as"
125,PREFACE,to those who have been in the habit of using it as a guide to paintings
126,PREFACE,and sculptures of mythological subjects in foreign galleries.
127,PREFACE,
128,PREFACE,Much of our best English poetry lies beyond the imaginative reach of
129,PREFACE,many readers because of their unfamiliarity with the commonplaces of
130,PREFACE,"literary allusion, reference, and tradition. Of such commonplaces few"
131,PREFACE,are more frequently recurrent than those furnished by the literature of
132,PREFACE,myth.
133,PREFACE,
134,PREFACE,"In view of this consideration, the Academic Council of the University"
135,PREFACE,"of California, some twenty years ago, introduced into its requirements"
136,PREFACE,for entrance in English the subject of Classical Mythology in its
137,PREFACE,"relation to English Literature, and recommended, as a textbook for"
138,PREFACE,"preparation, Bulfinch's ""Age of Fable."" The experience of English and"
139,PREFACE,classical teachers in the schools of the state attested the wisdom of
140,PREFACE,the requirement; but the demand for some textbook adapted to the needs
141,PREFACE,of the classroom made necessary the preparation of this volume. For
142,PREFACE,"while ""The Age of Fable"" offered a tempting collection of Greek, Norse,"
143,PREFACE,"and Oriental narratives, it was designed neither as a schoolbook nor as"
144,PREFACE,a systematized presentation and interpretation of the myths that have
145,PREFACE,most influenced English literature.
146,PREFACE,
147,PREFACE,At the request of my publishers I undertook at that time such a
148,PREFACE,"revision and rearrangement of the materials of ""The Age of Fable"" as"
149,PREFACE,"might adapt it to the purposes of teacher and pupil, and to the taste"
150,PREFACE,of readers somewhat more advanced in years than those addressed by the
151,PREFACE,original work or by the edition which bore the name of the Reverend
152,PREFACE,Edward Everett Hale. But after a year's work I found that half my
153,PREFACE,"material for copy was new, and that the remainder differed in many"
154,PREFACE,"important respects from the book upon which it was based. Consequently,"
155,PREFACE,"while the obligation to ""The Age of Fable"" was acknowledged in full,"
156,PREFACE,a different title was selected for the resulting volume. For neither
157,PREFACE,my publishers nor I desired that the scholarship or the taste of Mr.
158,PREFACE,Bulfinch should be held accountable for liberties that were taken with
159,PREFACE,his work.
160,PREFACE,
161,PREFACE,"In ""The Classic Myths in English Literature and in Art,"" Chapters"
162,PREFACE,"XXIII-XXVII, containing sketches of the Fall of Troy, the Odyssey,"
163,PREFACE,"the Æneid, and of certain Norse lays, are a revision of corresponding"
164,PREFACE,"chapters in ""The Age of Fable."" Chapters VII-XX, and XXII, comprising"
165,PREFACE,"Myths of the Greater Divinities of Heaven, Earth, the Underworld, and"
166,PREFACE,"the Waters, Myths of the Lesser Divinities of the same regions, Myths"
167,PREFACE,"of the Older Heroes and Myths of the Younger Heroes, and the outline of"
168,PREFACE,"the Trojan War, represent a total rearrangement and recomposition of"
169,PREFACE,"the original material, section by section, and frequently paragraph by"
170,PREFACE,"paragraph,--such portions of ""The Age of Fable"" as have been retained"
171,PREFACE,"being abridged or rewritten, and, in places too frequent to enumerate,"
172,PREFACE,"supplemented by new and necessary sentences, paragraphs, and sections."
173,PREFACE,"The Introduction, the first six chapters (on the Greek Myths of the"
174,PREFACE,"Creation, and the attributes of Greek and Roman divinities), Chapters"
175,PREFACE,"XXI and XXVIII-XXXII (on the Houses concerned in the Trojan War, the"
176,PREFACE,"Saga of the Volsungs, the Lay of the Nibelungs, Wagner's Ring of the"
177,PREFACE,"Nibelung, and on the origin, elements, distribution, and preservation"
178,PREFACE,"of myth), the choice of poetic and artistic illustration, the footnotes"
179,PREFACE,"referring to sources, and the Commentary are wholly, or essentially, my"
180,PREFACE,"own. In fact, there is little but the scaffolding of ""The Age of Fable"""
181,PREFACE,now remaining in the book.
182,PREFACE,
183,PREFACE,Although in the Index of Mythological Subjects and their Sources the
184,PREFACE,"more common myths of some other nations are briefly stated, no myths"
185,PREFACE,"save those known to the Greeks, Romans, Norsemen, or Germans have"
186,PREFACE,been included in the body of the text. The scope of selection has
187,PREFACE,"been thus confined for three reasons: first, the regard for necessary"
188,PREFACE,"limits; second, the desirability of emphasizing only such myths as"
189,PREFACE,have actually acclimated themselves in English-speaking lands and have
190,PREFACE,"influenced the spirit, form, and habit of English imaginative thought;"
191,PREFACE,"third, the necessity of excluding all but the unquestionably classic."
192,PREFACE,"The term _classic_, however, is, of course, not restricted to the"
193,PREFACE,products of Greece and Rome; nor is it employed as synonymous with
194,PREFACE,Classical or as antithetical to Romantic. From the extreme Classical to
195,PREFACE,the extreme Romantic is a far cry; but as human life knows no divorce
196,PREFACE,"of necessity from freedom, so genuine art knows neither an unrelieved"
197,PREFACE,Classical nor an unrestrained Romantic. Classical and Romantic are
198,PREFACE,relative terms. The Classical and the Romantic of one generation
199,PREFACE,may merit equally to be the classics of the next. Therefore certain
200,PREFACE,Hellenic myths of romantic spirit or construction have been included in
201,PREFACE,"this work, and certain Norse and German myths have not been excluded."
202,PREFACE,"Whatever is admitted, is admitted as first-class: first-class, because"
203,PREFACE,"simple, spontaneous, and beautiful; because fulfilling the requirements"
204,PREFACE,"of perennial freshness, of æsthetic potency, and of ideal worth."
205,PREFACE,
206,PREFACE,In the matter of illustrative English and American poems the principle
207,PREFACE,of selection has been that the verses shall translate a myth from
208,PREFACE,"the classic original, or exemplify the poetic idealization and"
209,PREFACE,"embellishment of the subject, or suggest the spirit and mien of ancient"
210,PREFACE,art. But in each case regard has been had to the æsthetic value of
211,PREFACE,the poem or the citation. In the search for suitable examples I have
212,PREFACE,"derived valuable assistance from Mr. E.C. Guild's ""Bibliography of"
213,PREFACE,"Greek Mythology in English Poetry of the Nineteenth Century"" (Bowdoin"
214,PREFACE,"College, _Library Bulletin No. 1_). The student is also referred to"
215,PREFACE,"A.E. Sawtelle's ""Sources of Spenser's Mythology,"" C.G. Osgood's'"
216,PREFACE,"""Classical Mythology of Milton,"" and R.K. Root's ""Classical Mythology"
217,PREFACE,"in Shakespeare"" (Holt, 1896, 1900, and 1903, respectively)."
218,PREFACE,
219,PREFACE,"In the Commentary four things have been attempted: first, an"
220,PREFACE,"explanation, under each section, of ordinary textual difficulties;"
221,PREFACE,"second, an unpretentious exposition of the myth or a brief statement"
222,PREFACE,of the more evident interpretations advanced by philologists or
223,PREFACE,"ethnologists; third, an indication of certain additional poems or"
224,PREFACE,"verses that illustrate the myth; fourth, special mention of such"
225,PREFACE,masterpieces of ancient and modern sculpture and painting as may serve
226,PREFACE,to introduce the student or the general reader to a field of æsthetic
227,PREFACE,profit neglected by the great mass of our people. For the poetic
228,PREFACE,"conception of most of the myths contained in Chapters I-XXIV, we are"
229,PREFACE,indebted to the Greek imagination; but since this book is intended
230,PREFACE,"for students of English poetry, and since in English poetry Latin"
231,PREFACE,names of mythological characters are much more frequently employed
232,PREFACE,"than Greek, the Latin designations or Latinized forms of Greek names"
233,PREFACE,"have been, so far as possible, retained; and such variations as"
234,PREFACE,"Jupiter, Jove--Proserpina, Proserpine, freely used. In the chapters,"
235,PREFACE,"however, on the attributes of the Greek gods, names exclusively Greek"
236,PREFACE,"have been placed in parentheses after the usual Roman equivalents,"
237,PREFACE,"Latin appellations, or designations common to both Greek and Roman"
238,PREFACE,"usage. In the transliteration of Greek names I have followed, also,"
239,PREFACE,"the prevalent practice of our poets, which is, generally speaking,"
240,PREFACE,"the practice of the Romans. The diphthong #ei#, for instance, is"
241,PREFACE,"transliterated according to the accepted English pronunciation,"
242,PREFACE,which in individual words perpetuates the preference of the Latins
243,PREFACE,for the _e_ sound or the _i_ sound respectively. So #Atreidês#
244,PREFACE,"becomes Atr[=i]des; #Iphimedeia#, Iphimed[=i]a. But, on the other"
245,PREFACE,"hand, #Kythereia# becomes Cyther[=e]a; #Pêneios#, Pen[=e]us; and"
246,PREFACE,"#Mêdeia#, Med[=e]a; while owing to purely popular English custom, such"
247,PREFACE,"a name as #Pheidias# has become, not Pheidias nor even Ph[=i]dias,"
248,PREFACE,"but--_Ph[)i]dias_. A few names of islands, towns, persons, etc., that"
249,PREFACE,"even in Latin retain their Greek forms,--such as Delos, Naxos, Argos,"
250,PREFACE,"Aglauros, Pandrosos,--have been transferred without modification."
251,PREFACE,"So also has Poseidon, because that is the common English spelling."
252,PREFACE,"In short, the practice aimed at has been not that of scientific"
253,PREFACE,"uniformity, but of acknowledged poetic usage. In the titles of the"
254,PREFACE,"illustrative cuts, Greek names have been used for works of Greek"
255,PREFACE,"origin, Latin for the Roman."
256,PREFACE,
257,PREFACE,For the benefit of readers who do not know the fundamental rules for
258,PREFACE,"the pronunciation of Greek and Latin proper names in English, a brief"
259,PREFACE,statement of rules is prefixed to the Index; and in the Index of
260,PREFACE,"Mythological Subjects and their Sources names are not only accented,"
261,PREFACE,"but, when necessary, diacritically marked."

1301,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,
1302,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,Our American educational methods too frequently seek to produce the
1303,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,effect of polish upon a kind of sandstone information that will
1304,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,not stand polishing. With such fatuity many of our teachers in the
1305,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,secondary schools exercise their pupils in the study of English
1306,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,masterpieces and in the critical estimate of æsthetic qualities
1307,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"before acquainting them with the commonplace facts and fables that,"
1308,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"transmitted through generations, are the material of much of our poetry"
1309,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"because the material of daily converse, imagination, and thought. These"
1310,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,commonplaces of tradition are to be found largely in the literature
1311,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,of mythology. Of course the evil would be neither so widespread nor
1312,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,so dangerous if more of the guardians and instructors of our youth
1313,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,were at home even among the Greek and Latin classics. But for various
1314,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"reasons,--some valid, as, for instance, the importance of increased"
1315,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,attention to the modern languages and the natural sciences; others
1316,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"worthless, as the so-called utilitarian protest against the cultivation"
1317,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"of ""dead"" languages,--for various reasons the study of the classics"
1318,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"is at present considerably impaired. It is, therefore, incumbent upon"
1319,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"our universities and schools, recognizing this fact and deploring it,"
1320,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,to abate so far as possible the unfortunate consequences that proceed
1321,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"therefrom, until, by a readjustment of subjects of instruction and"

1329,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,
1330,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"Now, one evident means of tempering the consequence of this neglect"
1331,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,of the classics is the study of them through translations and
1332,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,summaries. Such secondhand study must indeed be ever a makeshift; for
1333,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"the literature of a people inheres in its language, and loses its"

1336,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"of diverse conditions of physical environment, history, social and"
1337,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,intellectual tradition. But in dealing with the purely imaginative
1338,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"products of antiquity, the inefficacy of translation may be somewhat"
1339,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"offset if those products be reproduced, so far as possible, not in the"
1340,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,prosaic but in the poetic atmosphere and in the imaginative garb of

1343,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,the fashion of poetry itself varies from age to age and from clime
1344,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"to clime, the genesis of imagination is universal, its products are"
1345,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"akin, and its process is continuous. For this reason the study of the"

1397,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,
1398,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,It goes without saying that a rational series of somewhat consecutive

1407,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,that should render the general reading of _belles-lettres_ more
1408,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,profitable. For a previous acquaintance with the material of literary
1409,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,tradition heightens the appreciation of each allusive passage as it is
1410,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,encountered; it enables the reader to sympathize with the mood and to

1412,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,orator; it expands the intellectual lungs for the atmosphere breathed

1414,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,less asthmatic than that to which so many of us are unconsciously
1415,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,habituated. Of course all this advantage would far better result
1416,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,from the first-hand nutriment and discipline of the Greek and Latin
1417,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,classics; of course direct familiarity with the writers of Greece

1419,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,"evaluation of modern literature; and, of course, a sympathy with the"
1420,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,imaginings of old is the best incentive to an æsthetic estimate not
1421,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,only of art but of nature to-day; but if our American pupils and many

1423,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,to scent the bouquet. In time a sense of flavor may perchance be

1461,THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH POETRY AND WITH ART,search for truth _through_ mythology is wise and profitable. If we

1489,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"essential that the teacher of mythology, no matter what textbook"
1490,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"or system he uses or what classic epic he proposes to present,"
1491,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"should first make himself acquainted with the meaning of myth, its"

1499,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"perhaps, as elsewhere; but no matter where he obtains this information"
1500,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,he should in a simple and interesting talk pass on the cream of it
1501,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,to the pupils about to begin the study of the stories themselves. He

1503,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"of myths and their relation to our civilization, and awaken in them"

1508,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"may, if time permits, read these concluding chapters, and so obtain"
1509,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"a systematic outlook upon the subject, during a brief review in the"
1510,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"senior year, but not earlier."
1511,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1512,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,This book should be studied for its materials and the inspiration
1513,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"that it affords,--not word by word for its style, or as a dictionary"
1514,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,or scientific authority; nor paragraph by paragraph with a painful
1515,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,committing to memory of each myth and each episode in the myth.
1516,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Discrimination must be made. Some of these myths, and especially the"
1517,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"episodes from the epics (Chapters XXII-XXIX), are to be read rapidly"
1518,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and in large assignments, sometimes at home with reports in class,"
1519,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"sometimes in class and at sight, but always for the enjoyment. Others"
1520,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"are to be studied in detail, but solely when they are of special and"
1521,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"vital significance, historically, morally, or æsthetically. Emphasis"
1522,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,should be laid only occasionally and sparingly upon interpretations of
1523,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,mythical materials. What both teacher and student should aim at is the
1524,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"picture--manners, morals, ideals, heroic figures, epic events, broad"
1525,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and vivid against the canvas of antiquity: that, and the reality of"
1526,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"classic order, grandeur, and restraint."
1527,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1528,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,The myths are here presented in a logical and genealogical arrangement;
1529,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and they should be studied in this order, so that the pupil may carry"
1530,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"away, not a jumble of sporadic recollections, but some conception"
1531,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,of the systems of creative imagination which obtained in earlier
1532,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,civilizations. The knowledge of the myths and the proper perspective
1533,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"of their relation, one to another, may further be fixed by the study"
1534,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,of the family ties that motivate many of the incidents of mythical
1535,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"adventure, and that must have been commonplaces of information to the"
1536,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,inventors and narrators of these stories.
1537,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1538,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"The myths may well be reproduced as exercises in narration, comparison,"
1539,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,description; and they may be regarded as stimulus for imaginative
1540,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,invention concerning local wonders and beauties of nature. Pupils
1541,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"may also be encouraged to consider, and to comment upon, the moral"
1542,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,qualities of the heroes and heroines of mythology. Thus they may be led
1543,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,to recognize the difference between ancient and modern standards of
1544,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"right and wrong. To this end, and for the supply of further nutriment,"
1545,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,it is important that teachers collect from their reading of the
1546,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"classic originals, or from translations of the Iliad, the Odyssey,"
1547,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"the Greek dramatists, the Æneid, the Metamorphoses, etc., material"
1548,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"supplementary to the text, and give it freely to their classes. To"
1549,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,facilitate this practice the sources of the myths have been indicated
1550,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"in the footnotes of this volume, and a few of the best translations"
1551,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,have been mentioned in the Commentary. Instructors should also read to
1552,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"the classes illustrative English poems, or portions of them based upon"
1553,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the myths under consideration; and they should encourage the pupils to
1554,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,collect from their English reading additional examples of the literary
1555,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,survival or adaptation of ancient story. For this purpose special
1556,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"sections of the Commentary have been prepared, indicating some of the"
1557,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,best known literary applications of each myth.
1558,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1559,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,The Commentary is numbered in sections corresponding to those of the
1560,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,text. The Textual Notes should be studied in connection with each
1561,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"lesson, the Interpretative more sparingly, as I have said. They should"
1562,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,not be suffered to spoil the interest in the stories as such. They
1563,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,are of interest in themselves only to maturer minds. Allusions and
1564,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"interpretations which the younger pupil does not appreciate will, if"
1565,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"the book is used for purposes of reference in his further English,"
1566,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Latin, or Greek studies, be clear before the end of his course."
1567,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1568,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,From the outset care should be taken that pupils give to the classical
1569,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"names their proper accent, and that they anglicize both vowels and"
1570,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,consonants according to the recognized rules laid down in the Latin
1571,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"grammars, the English dictionaries, and the pages preceding the Index"
1572,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,of this book.
1573,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1574,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,Mythological and classical geography should not be neglected. The maps
1575,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,accompanying this volume will be serviceable; but there should be
1576,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,in the classroom one of Kiepert's maps of the World as Known to the
1577,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Ancients (Orbis Veteribus Notus), or maps of Ancient Italy, Greece,"
1578,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,and Asia Minor. The teacher will find the International Atlas (G.
1579,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"P. Putnam's Sons, New York), A. Keith Johnston's School and College"
1580,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Atlas of Ancient Geography, or the new edition of the same by James"
1581,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Cranstoun, issued as Ginn and Company's Classical Atlas, indispensable"
1582,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,in the prosecution of general reading.
1583,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1584,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"When it is the intention to study, in connection with the book,"
1585,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"an Homeric epic or a portion of it, the teacher should first make"
1586,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,sure that the class has an adequate preliminary training in general
1587,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"mythology (such, for instance, as may be provided by the first"
1588,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,twenty-one chapters); he should then outline rapidly and entertainingly
1589,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"the epic as a whole, emphasizing its position in the literature of the"
1590,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"world and its relation to the world of its own times, before proceeding"
1591,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,to read it in detail with the class. Excellent suggestions as to this
1592,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,method of study are offered in the Introduction to Maxwell & Chubb's
1593,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Pope's Homer's Iliad, Books I, VI, XXII, and XXIV (Longmans), and in"
1594,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the Introduction to the Riverside Edition of the Odyssey: Ulysses among
1595,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the Phæacians (Houghton Mifflin Company).
1596,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1597,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,The more important myths and the best illustrative poems should provide
1598,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"not only nutriment for thought, but material for memory. Our youth in"
1599,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"the push for hasty achievement bolt their meals; they masticate little,"
1600,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"swallow everything, digest nothing,--and having agonized, forget. If"
1601,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"fewer things were dispatched, especially in the study of literature,"
1602,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and if more were intrusted to the memory, there would be something to"
1603,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,assimilate and time to assimilate it; there would be less dyspepsia and
1604,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"more muscle. Teachers and parents are over-considerate, nowadays, of"
1605,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the memory in children: they approach it gingerly; they have feared so
1606,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,much to wring its withers that in most children the memory has grown
1607,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,too soft for saddling. In our apprehension lest pupils may turn out
1608,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"parrots, we have too often turned them out loons. It is better that a"
1609,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,few of the facts in their heads be wrong than that no facts be there
1610,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,at all. With all our study of children and our gabble about methods
1611,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"of teaching them, while we insist, properly enough, that youth is the"
1612,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"seedtime of observation, we seem to have forgotten that it is also the"
1613,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,harvest-time of memory. It is easy for children to remember what they
1614,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"learn, it is a delight for them to commit to memory; we act criminally"
1615,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,when we send them forth with hardly a fact or a date or a glorious
1616,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"verse in the memory of one out of ten of them. Such, unfortunately,"
1617,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,is the case in many of our schools; and such was not the case in the
1618,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,day of our fathers. Pupils should be encouraged to recite _memoriter_
1619,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the best poems and verses that accompany the myths here given; and
1620,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,they should not be allowed to pass allusions already explained without
1621,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,recalling verses that contain them.
1622,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1623,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"But above all things should be cultivated, by means of this study, the"
1624,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"spiritual capabilities of our youth. _Pabulum_ for thought, accurate"
1625,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"habits of memory, critical judgment, simplicity and directness of oral"
1626,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and written expression, may all be furnished or developed by other"
1627,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"educative agencies; but what stimulus to fancy, to poetic sensitiveness"
1628,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and reflection, to a near kinship with the spirit of nature humanized,"
1629,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,can be found more cogent than the contemplation of the poetic
1630,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"traditions that abide in verse? Mythology, fraught with the fire of"
1631,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"imagination, kindles the present from the past."
1632,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1633,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"In this new world of ours, shall slopes and mountains, gorges, cañons,"
1634,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"flowery fields and forests, rivers, bays, Titanic lakes, and shoreless"
1635,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"reach of ocean be seen of eyes that lack insight, be known of men for"
1636,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,whom nature does not live? Surely the age of myth is not wholly past;
1637,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,surely the beauties and the wonders of nature are a fable of things
1638,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"never fully revealed; surely this new republic of ours, no less than"
1639,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"her prototypes by Tyrrhenian and Ægean seas, utters, in her queenly"
1640,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"form and flowing robes, a spirit, a truth, a potential poetry, and a"
1641,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"beauty of art, the grace of which we Americans, with deeper imaginative"
1642,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"training and sympathy and awe, may yet more highly value and more"
1643,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,clearly comprehend.
1644,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1645,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,2. _Of the Classic Myths in their Relation to Art._[1] The illustration
1646,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"of a book on ancient mythology offers great difficulties, because"
1647,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"the modern reader expects one thing and the ancient artist, on whose"
1648,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"works one must rely, intentionally offers a very different thing. We"
1649,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"have grown to be a reading people, forming our ideas largely on the"
1650,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"written word, while in antiquity the spoken word opened the door to"
1651,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,understanding. A story which has been committed to writing is fixed
1652,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"for all time, having lost its power of growth; whereas a tale that"
1653,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"passes from mouth to mouth, with no record by which to check its"
1654,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"accuracy in particulars, is free to expand. It changes with the moods"
1655,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"of those who tell it, and the intellectual and moral standards of those"
1656,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,who listen. People to-day are unimaginative and literal. They also
1657,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,expect that the pictures which illustrate their books shall follow
1658,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the individual conceptions of the author closely. When the story is
1659,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"dramatized a certain latitude is granted to the actor; the artist,"
1660,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"however, who illustrates the book has no such freedom. He is expected"
1661,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"to take precisely the author's view of a fictitious character, and,"
1662,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"consequently, his individuality may show itself only in the technique."
1663,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,In antiquity there were no standard books of fiction or of myths.
1664,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"When writing came into use with the sixth century before Christ, the"
1665,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,individual versions of this or that great epic poem or drama were
1666,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"preserved; but the great mass of the people knew them, not because they"
1667,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"had read the manuscripts, but because they had heard them acted or"
1668,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"recited. Book illustrations, therefore, were unknown. Yet so powerful"
1669,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,was the impression which the myths made on the people that most of
1670,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the artists drew their inspiration from them. Artists and poets alike
1671,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,wished to make real the powerful characters of Greek tradition. To make
1672,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,a literally true illustration of any one version of a great myth was
1673,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,not the aim of a classic artist.
1674,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1675,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,Another difficulty is found in the fact that few ancient myths
1676,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,continued to be equally interesting to the people all the time. It is
1677,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"therefore necessary for us, in choosing illustrations, to draw on all"
1678,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"periods of ancient art, the crude beginning and the decline as well as"
1679,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the brief span of fine art. The comparatively meager store of genuinely
1680,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,classic works of art acts as one of the greatest obstacles to the
1681,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,compilation of a continuous record of classic myths in classic art.
1682,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"To give such a record, however, rather than to _illustrate_ his book,"
1683,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,must be the aim of the author who publishes to-day a version of ancient
1684,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,mythology together with such pictures or reliefs or statues as are
1685,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,preserved. The modern reader of such a book should therefore appreciate
1686,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,this fact: he must make allowance for the gradual development of
1687,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,ancient art. The picture is not there for the sake of strengthening
1688,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"the written work, but for its own sake. It often offers an independent"
1689,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"version of the myth which he reads, and at all times may give him an"
1690,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,insight into the mental make-up of the classic people.
1691,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1692,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Sculpture was the finest art of the Greeks, if one may judge by the"
1693,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,remains. In this province the artists worked according to the best
1694,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"principles of art, making their appeal directly to the nobler side"
1695,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,of man. Before an ancient statue one feels the power of an idea
1696,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"immediately, and not by the circuitous route of remembering a sequence"
1697,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,of words which may have aimed to suggest a similar idea. The Greeks
1698,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"were the least literal in their sculpture. Their marbles, therefore,"
1699,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"cannot yield _illustrations_ which the modern editor can use, except"
1700,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"when they embody, like the Demeter of Knidos (Fig. 29) or the Athena"
1701,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"of Velletri (Fig. 10), a well-defined character-conception. The modern"
1702,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"reader, on the other hand, cannot fail to notice that this conception"
1703,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,never does justice to the character of the goddess as it appears in
1704,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"all the myths, and very rarely even to that characteristic which may"
1705,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"dominate the particular version of any one myth. If such pictures,"
1706,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"however, were entirely omitted from the book, the best means of"
1707,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,appreciating the essential nobility of the Greek mind would be lost.
1708,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1709,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,None of the Greek masterpieces of painting are extant. Their attenuated
1710,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"influence, however, may be traced in the Italian wall paintings from"
1711,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,Pompeii and elsewhere. Painting permits greater literalness than
1712,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"sculpture. The picture from Herculaneum, for instance,--Io, Argus,"
1713,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and Mercury (Fig. 47),--tells a definite story and one which is also"
1714,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,told by the poets. But the painter has considered the making of a
1715,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"pleasing picture first, and given only a secondary thought to accuracy"
1716,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,of tradition. This must be so; for while we may without displeasure
1717,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"listen to the description of a monster, we cannot see his actual"
1718,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,representation without discomfort. When we hear how the companions
1719,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"of Ulysses were turned into swine, the tragic note is never lost. To"
1720,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"paint this scene, however, and not to border on the ridiculous or"
1721,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the burlesque is given only to the greatest artist--if it is at all
1722,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,possible.
1723,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1724,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"Fortunately for our purposes of illustration, there was a class of"
1725,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,secondary artists in Greece which did not always shrink from selecting
1726,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"subjects ill adapted for art, and from rendering them with slight"
1727,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,variations so that they are neither bad to look at nor altogether
1728,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,untrue. These were the painters of vases. Some of them were masters of
1729,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"their craft (cf. Fig. 116), others were of only mediocre skill. All,"
1730,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"however, like their nobler brethren, were primarily concerned with the"
1731,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,decorative and technical side of their art and but secondarily with
1732,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"their subject. If the story, for instance, called for four persons and"
1733,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"their space for five, they unhesitatingly added the fifth person, and,"
1734,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"vice versa, removed one without compunction if they had place for fewer"
1735,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"figures than the story demanded. Being, moreover, commercial people,"
1736,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,they painted according to fashion. Whatever version of a myth happened
1737,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"to be popular, that they selected, so that it has been possible to"
1738,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,trace by their vases the changes which several myths underwent from the
1739,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,sixth century onward.
1740,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1741,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,A careful student notices the similarity of types in many of these
1742,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,pictures and realizes that the ancient painter of vases started out
1743,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"with a certain stock-in-trade which he altered as little as possible,"
1744,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,adding something new only where it was absolutely necessary.
1745,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1746,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,From these observations it is clear that the works of men who were
1747,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,least gifted artistically are the best adapted for the purposes of book
1748,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,illustrations; for a painter is literal in the inverse ratio of his
1749,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"worth as artist. Nothing, therefore, could be less fair than to judge"
1750,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,Greek vase painting by the collection of pictures here offered. Only
1751,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"paintings like Figures 85 and 101, for instance, can give a hint of the"
1752,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,best that these men produced.
1753,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1754,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,Going gradually down the scale of artists one finally comes to the
1755,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"level of the makers of Roman sarcophagi, in whose honor it can only be"
1756,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"said that to descend lower is impossible. Several myths, however,--the"
1757,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"story of the fall of Phaëthon (Fig. 59), for instance,--are not"
1758,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,illustrated in art before the decadent period of imperial Roman
1759,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,sculpture. It is therefore necessary to draw also upon this source.
1760,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,
1761,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,Of course unity of art or school or excellence cannot be preserved in
1762,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"a set of pictures which groups the Demeter of Knidos (Fig. 29), the"
1763,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"blinding of Polyphemus (Fig. 171), and the fall of Phaëthon (Fig. 59)."
1764,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,But individually the pictures help to fix in memory the particular
1765,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,stories that they are chosen to illustrate; and collectively they
1766,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,show how strongly the myths here retold influenced the noblest fancy
1767,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,of the great artists as well as the receptive minds of mediocre
1768,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"artisans. The suggestive power of classic myths, moreover, was not"
1769,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,confined to antiquity. When learning and culture returned to the world
1770,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"in the Renaissance, this power also returned. Raphael (see Fig. 12)"
1771,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"and Michelangelo (see Fig. 183) were under its sway, and so are many"
1772,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,modern artists (see Figs. 72 and 154). They did not all understand the
1773,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"classic spirit equally, therefore some of their pictures are modern"
1774,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"in everything save the title, while others have caught the truth with"
1775,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,singular accuracy and are modern only in technique. Adding these
1776,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,Italian and more recent pictures to the collection further destroys
1777,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,"mere unity, but it insures, on the other hand, a full appreciation of"
1778,SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS,the abiding and ennobling power of ancient mythology.

1801,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=1. Purpose of the Study.= Interwoven with the fabric of our English
1802,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"literature, of our epics, dramas, lyrics, and novels, of our essays"
1803,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and orations, like a golden warp where the woof is only too often of"
1804,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"silver, are the myths of certain ancient nations. It is the purpose of"
1805,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"this work to relate some of these myths, and to illustrate the uses to"
1806,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"which they have been put in English literature, and, incidentally, in"
1807,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,art.
1808,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1809,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=2. The Fable and the Myth.= Careful discrimination must be made
1810,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"between the fable and the myth. A fable is a story, like that of"
1811,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"King Log, or the Fox and the Grapes, in which characters and plot,"
1812,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"neither pretending to reality nor demanding credence, are fabricated"
1813,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,confessedly as the vehicle of moral or didactic instruction. Dr.
1814,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Johnson narrows still further the scope of the fable: ""It seems to"
1815,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"be, in its genuine state, a narrative in which _beings_ _irrational,"
1816,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and sometimes inanimate_, are, for the purpose of moral instruction,"
1817,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"feigned to act and speak with human interests and passions."" Myths,"
1818,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"on the other hand, are stories of anonymous origin, prevalent among"
1819,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"primitive peoples and by them accepted as true, concerning supernatural"
1820,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"beings and events, or natural beings and events influenced by"
1821,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,supernatural agencies. Fables are made by individuals; they may be told
1822,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"in any stage of a nation's history,--by a Jotham when the Israelites"

1834,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"They owe their features not to any one historic individual, but to"
1835,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,the imaginative efforts of generations of story-tellers. The myth

1837,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"graces, and of Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven for the use of"

1839,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"with the gods the sovereignty of the universe; of the moon-goddess who,"
1840,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"with her buskined nymphs, pursues the chase across the azure of the"
1841,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"heavens, or descending to earth cherishes the youth Endymion,--these"
1842,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"myths, germinating in some quaint and childish interpretation of"
1843,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"natural events or in some fireside fancy, have put forth unconsciously,"
1844,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"under the nurture of the simple folk that conceived and tended them,"
1845,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"luxuriant branches and leaves of narrative, and blossoms of poetic"
1846,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,comeliness and form.
1847,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1848,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,The myths that we shall relate present wonderful accounts of the
1849,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"creation, histories of numerous divine beings, adventures of heroes"
1850,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"in which magical and ghostly agencies play a part, and where animals"
1851,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,and inanimate nature don the attributes of men and gods. Many of these
1852,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"myths treat of divinities once worshiped by the Greeks and the Romans,"
1853,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and by our Norse and German forefathers in the dark ages. Myths, more"
1854,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"or less like these, may be found in the literatures of nearly all"
1855,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,nations; many are in the memories and mouths of savage races at this
1856,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,time existent. But the stories here narrated are no longer believed by
1857,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,any one. The so-called divinities of Olympus and of Asgard have not a
1858,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,single worshiper among men. They dwell only in the realm of memory and
1859,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,imagination; they are enthroned in the palace of art.

1861,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"The stories of Greek, Roman, Norse, and German mythology that have"
1862,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,most influenced our English literature will follow in the order

1864,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"incorporated in their literature the mythology of the Greeks. We shall,"
1865,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"however, append to our description of the Greek gods a brief account"
1866,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,of the native Latin divinities that retained an individuality in Roman
1867,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,literature.

1870,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1871,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=3. Origin of the World.=[2] There were among the Greeks several
1872,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"accounts of the beginning of things. Homer tells us that River Ocean,"
1873,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"a deep and mighty flood, encircling land and sea like a serpent with"
1874,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"its tail in its mouth, was the source of all. According to other myths"
1875,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Night and Darkness were the prime elements of Nature, and from them"
1876,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"sprang Light. Still a third theory, attributed to Orpheus, asserts"
1877,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"that Time was in the beginning, but had himself no beginning; that"
1878,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"from him proceeded Chaos, a yawning abyss wherein brooded Night and"
1879,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Mist and fiery air, or Æther; that Time caused the mist to spin round"
1880,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the central fiery air till the mass, assuming the form of a huge world"
1881,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"egg, flew, by reason of its rapid rotation, into halves. Of these, one"
1882,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"was Heaven, the other Earth. From the center of the egg proceeded Eros"
1883,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,(Love) and other wondrous beings.
1884,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1885,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,But the most consistent account of the origin of the world and of the
1886,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"gods is given by the poet Hesiod, who tells us that Chaos, the yawning"
1887,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"abyss, composed of Void, Mass, and Darkness in confusion, preceded all"
1888,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"things else. Next came into being broad-bosomed Earth, and beautiful"
1889,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Love who should rule the hearts of gods and men. But from Chaos itself
1890,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"issued Erebus,[3] the mysterious darkness that is under Earth,--and"
1891,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Night, dwelling in the remote regions of sunset."
1892,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1893,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"From Mother Earth proceeded first the starry vault of Heaven, durable"
1894,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"as brass or iron, where the gods were to take up their abode. Earth"
1895,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"brought forth next the mountains and fertile fields, the stony plains,"
1896,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the sea, and the plants and animals that possess them."
1897,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1898,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=4. Origin of the Gods.= So far we have a history of the throes and
1899,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,changes of the physical world; now begins the history of gods and
1900,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of men. For in the heart of creation Love begins to stir, making of"
1901,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"material things creatures male and female, and bringing them together"
1902,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"by instinctive affinity. First Erebus and Night, the children of Chaos,"
1903,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"are wedded, and from them spring Light and Day; then _Uranus_, the"
1904,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"personified Heaven, takes _Gæa_, the Earth, to wife, and from their"
1905,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,union issue Titans and hundred-handed monsters and Cyclopes.
1906,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1907,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,The _Titans_[4] appear to be the personification of mighty convulsions
1908,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of the physical world, of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. They"
1909,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,played a quarrelsome part in mythical history; they were instigators of
1910,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"hatred and strife. Homer mentions specially two of them, Iapetus and"
1911,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Cronus; but Hesiod enumerates thirteen. Of these, the more important"
1912,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"are Oceanus and Tethys, Hyperion and Thea, Cronus and Rhea, Iapetus,"
1913,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Themis, and Mnemosyne. The three _Cyclopes_ represented the terrors"
1914,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of rolling thunder, of the lightning-flash, and of the thunderbolt;"
1915,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and, probably, for this reason, one fiery eye was deemed enough for"
1916,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"each. The hundred-handed monsters, or _Hecatonchires_, were also three"
1917,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"in number. In them, probably, the Greeks imaged the sea with its"
1918,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"multitudinous waves, its roar, and its breakers that seem to shake the"
1919,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"earth. These lightning-eyed, these hundred-handed monsters, their"
1920,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"father Uranus feared, and attempted to destroy by thrusting them into"
1921,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Tartarus, the profound abysm of the earth. Whereupon Mother Earth, or"
1922,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Gæa, indignant, called for help upon her elder children, the Titans."
1923,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"None dared espouse her cause save Cronus, the crafty. With an iron"
1924,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"sickle he lay in wait for his sire, fell upon him, and drove him,"
1925,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"grievously wounded, from the encounter. From the blood of the mutilated"
1926,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Uranus leaped into being the Furies, whose heads writhe with serpents;"
1927,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the Giants, a novel race of monsters; and the Melic Nymphs, invidious"
1928,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,maidens of the ashen spear.
1929,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1930,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=5. The Rule of Cronus.= Now follows the reign of Cronus, lord of"
1931,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Heaven and Earth. He is, from the beginning, of incalculable years. In"
1932,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"works of art his head is veiled, to typify his cunning and his reserve;"
1933,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,he bears the sickle not only as memento of the means by which he
1934,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"brought his father's tyranny to end, but as symbol of the new period of"
1935,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,growth and golden harvests that he ushered in.
1936,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1937,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"For unknown ages Cronus and Rhea, his sister-queen, governed Heaven"
1938,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and Earth. To them were born three daughters, Vesta, Ceres, and Juno,"
1939,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and three sons, Pluto, Neptune, and Jupiter. Cronus, however, having"
1940,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,learned from his parents that he should be dethroned by one of his own
1941,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"children, conceived the well-intentioned but ill-considered device"
1942,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of swallowing each as it was born. His queen, naturally desirous of"
1943,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"discouraging the practice,--when it came to the turn of her sixth"
1944,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"child, palmed off on the insatiable Cronus a stone carefully enveloped"
1945,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"in swaddling clothes. Jupiter (or Zeus), the rescued infant, was"
1946,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"concealed in the island of Crete, where, nurtured by the nymphs"
1947,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Adrastea and Ida, and fed on the milk of the goat Amalthea, he in due"
1948,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"season attained maturity. Then, assisted by his grandmother Gæa, he"
1949,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,constrained Cronus to disgorge the burden of his cannibal repasts.
1950,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"First came to light the memorable stone, which was placed in safe"
1951,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"keeping at Delphi; then the five brothers and sisters of Jupiter,"
1952,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,ardent to avenge themselves upon the unnatural author of their
1953,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,existence and their captivity.
1954,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1955,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=6. The War of the Titans.= In the war which ensued Iapetus and all
1956,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the Titans, except Oceanus, ranged themselves on the side of their"
1957,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,brother Cronus against Jupiter and his recently recovered kinsfolk.
1958,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Jupiter and his hosts held Mount Olympus. For ages victory wavered in
1959,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the balance. Finally Jupiter, acting again under the advice of Gæa,"
1960,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"released from Tartarus, where Uranus had confined them, the Cyclopes"
1961,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,and the Hecatonchires. Instantly they hastened to the battle-field
1962,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of Thessaly, the Cyclopes to support Jupiter with their thunders"
1963,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and lightnings, the hundred-handed monsters with the shock of the"
1964,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"earthquake. Provided with such artillery, shaking earth and sea,"
1965,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Jupiter issued to the onslaught. With the gleam of the lightning the
1966,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Titans were blinded, by the earthquake they were laid low, with the"
1967,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,flames they were well-nigh consumed: overpowered and fettered by the
1968,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"hands of the Hecatonchires, they were consigned to the yawning cave of"
1969,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Tartarus. Atlas, the son of Iapetus, was doomed to bear the heavens on"
1970,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"his shoulders. But a more famous son of the same Titan, Prometheus, who"
1971,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"had espoused the cause of Jove, acquired dignity hereafter to be set"
1972,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,forth.
1973,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1974,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=7. The Division of Empire.= In the council of the gods that succeeded,"
1975,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Jupiter was chosen Sovereign of the World. He delegated to his brother
1976,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Neptune (or Poseidon) the kingdom of the sea and of all the waters; to
1977,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"his brother Pluto (or Hades), the government of the underworld, dark,"
1978,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"unseen, mysterious, where the spirits of the dead should dwell, and"
1979,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of Tartarus, wherein were held the fallen Titans. For himself Jupiter"
1980,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"retained Earth and the Heaven, into whose broad and sunny regions"
1981,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"towered Olympus, the favored mountain of the greater gods.[5]"
1982,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
1983,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=8. The Reign of Jupiter.= New conflicts, however, awaited this new"
1984,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"dynasty of Heaven--conflicts, the subject of many a tale among the"
1985,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"ancients. Gæa, though she had aided her grandson Jupiter in the war"
1986,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"against Cronus, was soon seized with compunctions of conscience; and"
1987,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"contemplating the cruel fate of her sons the Titans, she conceived"
1988,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,schemes of vengeance upon their conqueror. Another son was born to
1989,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"her--_Typhon_, a monster more awful than his predecessors--whose"
1990,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,destiny it was to dispute the sway of the almighty Zeus. From the neck
1991,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,of Typhon dispread themselves a hundred dragon-heads; his eyes shot
1992,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"fire, and from his black-tongued chaps proceeded the hissing of snakes,"
1993,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the bellowing of bulls, the roaring of lions, the barking of dogs,"
1994,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"pipings and screams, and, at times, the voice and utterance of the gods"
1995,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,themselves. Against Heaven this horror lifted himself; but quailing
1996,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"before the thunderbolt of Jove, he too descended to Tartarus, his own"
1997,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"place and the abode of his brethren. To this day, however, he grumbles"
1998,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and hisses, thrusts upward a fiery tongue through the crater of a"
1999,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"volcano, or, breathing siroccos, scorches trees and men."
2000,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2001,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,[Illustration: FIG. 2. ATHENA AND GIANT]
2002,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2003,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Later still, the _Giants_, offspring of the blood that fell from the"
2004,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"wounded Uranus, renewed the revolt against the Olympian gods. They were"
2005,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"creatures nearer akin to men than were the Titans, or the Cyclopes,"
2006,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"or Typhon. They clothed themselves in the skins of beasts, and armed"
2007,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,themselves with rocks and trunks of trees. Their bodies and lower
2008,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,limbs were of snakes. They were awful to encounter or to look upon.
2009,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"They were named, like men, the _earthborn_; and their characteristics"
2010,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"would suggest some prehistoric brutish race, hotheaded, not amenable"
2011,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"to reason.[6] Of the Giants, the more mighty were Alcyoneus of the"
2012,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"winter storms and icebergs, Pallas, and Enceladus, and Porphyrion"
2013,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the fire-king,--leader of the crew. In the war against them, Juno"
2014,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and Minerva, divinities of the new dynasty of Heaven, took active"
2015,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"part,--and Hercules, an earthly son of Jupiter, whose arrows aided"
2016,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,in their defeat. It was from the overthrow of Pallas that Athena (or
2017,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Minerva) derived, according to certain records, her proud designation"
2018,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of Pallas-Athena.[7] In due course, like the Titans and Typhon, the"
2019,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Giants were buried in the abyss of eternal darkness. What other outcome
2020,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,can be expected when mere physical or brute force joins issue with the
2021,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,enlightened and embattled hosts of heaven?

2024,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2025,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=9. The Origin of Man= was a question which the Greeks did not settle
2026,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,so easily as the Hebrews. Greek traditions do not trace all mankind
2027,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"to an original pair. On the contrary, the generally received opinion"
2028,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"was that men grew out of trees and stones, or were produced by the"
2029,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,rivers or the sea. Some said that men and gods were both derived from
2030,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Mother Earth, hence both _autochthonous_; and some, indeed, claimed"
2031,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,an antiquity for the human race equal to that of the divinities. All
2032,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"narratives, however, agree in one statement,--that the gods maintained"
2033,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"intimate relations with men until, because of the growing sinfulness"
2034,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and arrogance of mankind, it became necessary for the immortals to"
2035,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,withdraw their favor.
2036,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2037,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=10. Prometheus, a Creator.= There is a story which attributes the"
2038,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"making of man to Prometheus, whose father Iapetus had, with Cronus,"
2039,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"opposed the sovereignty of Jupiter. In that conflict, Prometheus,"
2040,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"gifted with prophetic wisdom, had adopted the cause of the Olympian"
2041,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,deities. To him and his brother Epimetheus was now committed the
2042,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,office of making man and providing him and all other animals with the
2043,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,faculties necessary for their preservation. Prometheus was to overlook
2044,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,the work of Epimetheus. Epimetheus proceeded to bestow upon the
2045,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"different animals the various gifts of courage, strength, swiftness,"
2046,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"sagacity; wings to one, claws to another, a shelly covering to a third."
2047,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,But Prometheus himself made a nobler animal than these. Taking some
2048,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"earth and kneading it with water, he made man in the image of the gods."
2049,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"He gave him an upright stature, so that while other animals turn their"
2050,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"faces toward the earth, man gazes on the stars. Then since Epimetheus,"
2051,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"always rash, and thoughtful when too late, had been so prodigal of his"
2052,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,gifts to other animals that no blessing was left worth conferring upon
2053,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the noblest of creatures, Prometheus ascended to heaven, lighted his"
2054,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"torch at the chariot of the sun, and brought down fire. With fire in"
2055,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,his possession man would be able to win her secrets and treasures from
2056,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the earth, to develop commerce, science, and the arts."
2057,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,

2059,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2060,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=11. The Age of Gold.= Whether in this or in other ways the world was
2061,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"furnished with inhabitants, the first age was an age of innocence and"
2062,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"happiness. Truth and right prevailed, though not enforced by law, nor"
2063,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,was there any in authority to threaten or to punish. The forest had
2064,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"not yet been robbed of its trees to yield timbers for vessels, nor"
2065,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,had men built fortifications round their towns. There were no such
2066,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"things as swords, spears, or helmets. The earth brought forth all"
2067,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"things necessary for man, without his labor in plowing or sowing."
2068,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Perpetual spring reigned, flowers sprang up without seed, the rivers"
2069,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"flowed with milk and wine, and yellow honey distilled from the oaks."
2070,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,This Golden Age had begun in the reign of Cronus.[8] And when these
2071,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"heroes fell asleep in death, they were translated in a pleasant dream"
2072,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"to a spiritual existence, in which, unseen by mortal eyes, they still"
2073,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,attended men as monitors and guardians.
2074,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2075,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=12. The Silver Age= came next, inferior to the golden. Jupiter"
2076,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"shortened the spring, and divided the year into seasons. Then,"
2077,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"first, men suffered the extremes of heat and cold, and houses became"
2078,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"necessary. Caves were their dwellings,--and leafy coverts of the woods,"
2079,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,and huts woven of twigs. Crops would no longer grow without planting.
2080,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"The farmer was constrained to sow the seed, and the ox to draw the"
2081,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"plow. This was a race of manly men, but insolent and impious. And when"
2082,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"they died, Jupiter made them ghosts of the underworld, but withheld the"
2083,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,privilege of immortal life.
2084,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2085,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=13. Prometheus, Champion of Man.= During this age when, as Hesiod"
2086,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"says, the altars of the blessed were neglected, and the gods were"
2087,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"denied their due, Prometheus stood forth--the champion of man against"
2088,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,the Olympians.[9] For the son of Cronus had grudged mortals the use
2089,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of fire, and was, in fact, contemplating their annihilation and the"
2090,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"creation of a new race. Therefore, once upon a time, when gods and"
2091,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"men were in dispute at Sicyon concerning the prerogatives of each,"
2092,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Prometheus, by an ingenious trick, attempted to settle the question"
2093,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"in favor of man. Dividing into two portions a sacrificial bull, he"
2094,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"wrapped all the eatable parts in the skin, cunningly surmounted with"
2095,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,uninviting entrails; but the bones he garnished with a plausible
2096,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"mass of fat. He then offered Jupiter his choice. The king of Heaven,"
2097,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"although he perceived the intended fraud, took the heap of bones and"
2098,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"fat, and, forthwith availing himself of this insult as an excuse for"
2099,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"punishing mankind, deprived the race of fire. But Prometheus regained"
2100,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the treasure, stealing it from Heaven in a hollow tube."
2101,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2102,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=14. Pandora.= Doubly enraged, Jupiter, in his turn, had recourse"
2103,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,to stratagem. He is declared to have planned for man a curse in the
2104,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,shape of woman. How the race had persisted hitherto without woman is a
2105,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"mystery; but that it had done so, with no slight degree of happiness,"
2106,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the experience of the Golden Age would seem to prove. However, the"
2107,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"bewitching evil was fashioned,--in Heaven, properly enough,--and every"
2108,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,god and goddess contributed something to her perfection. One gave her
2109,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"beauty, another persuasive charm, a third the faculty of music. And"
2110,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"they named her Pandora, ""the gift of all the gods."" Thus equipped,"
2111,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"she was conveyed to earth and presented to Epimetheus, who, without"
2112,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"hesitation, accepted the gift, though cautioned by his brother to"
2113,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,beware of Jupiter and all his ways. And the caution was not groundless.
2114,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,In the hand of Pandora had been placed by the immortals a casket or
2115,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,vase which she was forbidden to open. Overcome by an unaccountable
2116,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"curiosity to know what this vessel contained, she one day lifted the"
2117,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,cover and looked in. Forthwith there escaped a multitude of plagues for
2118,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"hapless man--gout, rheumatism, and colic for his body; envy, spite, and"
2119,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,revenge for his mind--and scattered themselves far and wide. Pandora
2120,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"hastened to replace the lid; but one thing only remained in the casket,"
2121,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,and that was _hope_.
2122,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2123,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=15. Prometheus Bound.= Because of his unselfish devotion to the cause
2124,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of humanity, Prometheus drew down on himself the anger of Olympian"
2125,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Jove, by whose order he was chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus, and"
2126,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"subjected to the attack of an eagle (or a vulture) which, for ages,"
2127,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"preyed upon his liver, yet succeeded not in consuming it. This state of"
2128,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"torment might have been brought to an end at any time by Prometheus,"
2129,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,if he had been willing to submit to his oppressor; for he possessed
2130,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,a secret which involved the stability of Jove's throne. This was
2131,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,that by a certain woman Jove would beget a son who should displace
2132,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,him and end the sway of the Olympians. The god naturally desired more
2133,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,accurate information of this decree of Fate. But to reveal the secret
2134,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Prometheus disdained. In this steadfastness the Titan was supported by
2135,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,the knowledge that in the thirteenth generation there should arrive a
2136,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"hero,--sprung from Jove himself,--to release him.[10] And in fullness"
2137,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,of time the hero did arrive: none other than the mighty Hercules
2138,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,desirous of rendering the highest service to mankind. No higher
2139,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"service, thinks this radiant and masterful personage,--who, as we shall"
2140,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"see, had already cleared the world of many a monster,--remains to be"
2141,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"performed than to free the champion of mankind, suffering through the"
2142,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"ages because he had brought light into the world. ""The soul of man,"""
2143,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,says Hercules to the Titan--
2144,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2145,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,The soul of man can never be enslaved
2146,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Save by its own infirmities, nor freed"
2147,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Save by its very strength and own resolve
2148,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,And constant vision and supreme endeavor!
2149,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"You will be free? Then, courage, O my brother!"
2150,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,O let the soul stand in the open door
2151,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Of life and death and knowledge and desire
2152,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,And see the peaks of thought kindle with sunrise!
2153,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Then shall the soul return to rest no more,"
2154,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Nor harvest dreams in the dark field of sleep--
2155,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Rather the soul shall go with great resolve
2156,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,To dwell at last upon the shining mountains
2157,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,In liberal converse with the eternal stars.[11]
2158,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2159,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,And he kills the vulture; and sets Jove's victim free.
2160,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2161,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,By his demeanor Prometheus has become the ensample of magnanimous
2162,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"endurance, and of resistance to oppression."
2163,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2164,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Titan! to whose immortal eyes
2165,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"The sufferings of mortality,"
2166,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Seen in their sad reality,"
2167,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Were not as things that gods despise,"
2168,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,What was thy pity's recompense?
2169,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"A silent suffering, and intense;"
2170,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"The rock, the vulture, and the chain,"
2171,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"All that the proud can feel of pain,"
2172,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"The agony they do not show,"
2173,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"The suffocating sense of woe,"
2174,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Which speaks but in its loneliness,"
2175,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,And then is jealous lest the sky
2176,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Should have a listener, nor will sigh"
2177,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Until its voice is echoless....
2178,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2179,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Thy godlike crime was to be kind,"
2180,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,To render with thy precepts less
2181,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"The sum of human wretchedness,"
2182,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,And strengthen man with his own mind.
2183,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"But, baffled as thou wert from high,"
2184,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Still, in thy patient energy,"
2185,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,In the endurance and repulse
2186,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Of thine impenetrable spirit,"
2187,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Which earth and heaven could not convulse,"
2188,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,A mighty lesson we inherit[12]....

2190,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,=16. Longfellow's Prometheus.= A happy application of the story of
2191,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Prometheus is made by Longfellow in the following verses:[13]
2192,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2193,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Of Prometheus, how undaunted"
2194,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,On Olympus' shining bastions
2195,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"His audacious foot he planted,"
2196,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Myths are told, and songs are chanted,"
2197,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Full of promptings and suggestions.
2198,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2199,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Beautiful is the tradition
2200,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Of that flight through heavenly portals,"
2201,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,The old classic superstition
2202,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Of the theft and the transmission
2203,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Of the fire of the Immortals!

2208,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Then the vulture,--the despairing"

2233,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,By affliction touched and saddened.
2234,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,

2240,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2241,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"All the melodies mysterious,"

2274,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2275,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=18. The Iron Age.= Last came the hardest age and worst,--of iron."
2276,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and honor fled. The gifts"
2277,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of the earth were put only to nefarious uses. Fraud, violence, war at"
2278,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,home and abroad were rife. The world was wet with slaughter; and the
2279,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"gods, one by one, abandoned it, Astræa, following last, goddess of"
2280,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,innocence and purity.
2281,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2282,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=19. The Flood.= Jupiter, observing the condition of things, burned"
2283,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"with anger. He summoned the gods to council. Obeying the call, they"
2284,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"traveled the Milky Way to the palace of Heaven. There, Jupiter set"
2285,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"forth to the assembly the frightful condition of the earth, and"
2286,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"announced his intention of destroying its inhabitants, and providing a"
2287,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"new race, unlike the present, which should be worthier of life and more"
2288,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,reverent toward the gods. Fearing lest a conflagration might set Heaven
2289,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"itself on fire, he proceeded to drown the world. Not satisfied with his"
2290,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"own waters, he called his brother Neptune to his aid. Speedily the race"
2291,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of men, and their possessions, were swept away by the deluge."
2292,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2293,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=20. Deucalion and Pyrrha.= Parnassus alone, of the mountains,"
2294,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"overtopped the waves; and there Deucalion, son of Prometheus, and"
2295,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"his wife Pyrrha, daughter of Epimetheus, found refuge--he a just man"
2296,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"and she a faithful worshiper of the gods. Jupiter, remembering the"
2297,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"harmless lives and pious demeanor of this pair, caused the waters to"
2298,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"recede,--the sea to return to its shores, and the rivers to their"
2299,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"channels. Then Deucalion and Pyrrha, entering a temple defaced with"
2300,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"slime, approached the unkindled altar and, falling prostrate, prayed"
2301,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"for guidance and aid. The oracle[15] answered, ""Depart from the temple"
2302,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"with head veiled and garments unbound, and cast behind you the bones"
2303,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"of your mother."" They heard the words with astonishment. Pyrrha first"
2304,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"broke silence: ""We cannot obey; we dare not profane the remains of"
2305,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"our parents."" They sought the woods, and revolved the oracle in their"
2306,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"minds. At last Deucalion spoke: ""Either my wit fails me or the command"
2307,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,is one we may obey without impiety. The earth is the great parent of
2308,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"all; the stones are her bones; these we may cast behind us; this, I"
2309,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"think, the oracle means. At least, to try will harm us not."" They"
2310,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"veiled their faces, unbound their garments, and, picking up stones,"
2311,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,cast them behind them. The stones began to grow soft and to assume
2312,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,shape. By degrees they put on a rude resemblance to the human form.
2313,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Those thrown by Deucalion became men; those by Pyrrha, women. It was a"
2314,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"hard race that sprang up, and well adapted to labor."
2315,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2316,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"=21. The Demigods and Heroes.= As preceding the Age of Iron, Hesiod"
2317,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"mentions an _Age of Demigods and Heroes_. Since, however, these"
2318,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"demigods and heroes were, many of them, reputed to have been directly"
2319,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"descended from Deucalion, their epoch must be regarded as subsequent"
2320,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"to the deluge. The hero, Hellen, son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, became"
2321,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the ancestor of the Hellenes, or Greeks. The Æolians and Dorians were,"
2322,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"according to legend, descended from his sons Æolus and Dorus; from his"
2323,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"son Xuthus, the Achæans and Ionians derived their origin."
2324,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2325,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Another great division of the Greek people, the Pelasgic, resident in"
2326,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the Peloponnesus or southern portion of the peninsula, was said to have"
2327,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"sprung from a different stock of heroes, that of Pelasgus, son of"
2328,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,Phoroneus of Argos and grandson of the river-god Inachus.
2329,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,
2330,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,The demigods and heroes were of matchless worth and valor. Their
2331,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,adventures form the subject of many of the succeeding chapters. The
2332,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Older Heroes, especially, were endowed with godlike qualities, which"
2333,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"they devoted to the service of mankind in the destruction of monsters,"
2334,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"the founding of cities, or the introduction of civilization. Such were"
2335,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Perseus, the hero of Argos and his descendant Hercules, who came to be"
2336,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"worshiped as the national hero of the Greeks. Such, too, Cadmus, the"
2337,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"founder of Thebes, and Cecrops of Athens, and one of his successors,"
2338,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,"Theseus, a ""second Hercules."" Each city of Greece had its patron hero,"
2339,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,to whom it accorded the honors of divinity. The Younger Heroes were
2340,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,chieftains in the Theban and the Trojan wars and in numerous other
2341,GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION,military or predatory expeditions.

2399,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"waters, or the underworld. In the great hall of the Olympian king the"
2400,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar. Here they conversed of
2401,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],the affairs of heaven and earth; and as they quaffed the nectar that
2402,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Hebe poured, Apollo made melody with his lyre and the Muses sang in"
2403,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"responsive strain. When the sun was set, the gods withdrew to their"
2404,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],respective dwellings for the night.
2405,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2406,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],The following lines from the Odyssey express the conception of Olympus
2407,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],entertained by Homer:
2408,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2409,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"So saying, Minerva, goddess, azure-eyed,"
2410,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat"
2411,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Eternal of the gods, which never storms"
2412,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm"
2413,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.
2414,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],There the inhabitants divine rejoice
2415,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Forever.[18]
2416,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2417,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],=23. The Great Gods.= The gods of Heaven were the following:[19]
2418,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2419,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Jupiter (Zeus).[20]
2420,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His daughter, Minerva (Athena), who sprang from his brain,"
2421,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],full-grown and full-armed.
2422,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His sister and wife, Juno (Hera)."
2423,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His children by Juno,--Mars (Ares), Vulcan (Hephæstus), and Hebe."
2424,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His children by Latona,--Apollo, or Ph[oe]bus, and Diana (Artemis)."
2425,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His daughter by Dione,--Venus (Aphrodite).[21]"
2426,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His son by Maia,--Mercury (Hermes)."
2427,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His sister, Vesta (Hestia), the oldest born of Cronus and Rhea."
2428,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2429,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Of these all were deities of the highest order save Hebe, who must"
2430,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"be ranked with the lesser gods. With the remaining ten ""Great Gods"""
2431,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"are sometimes reckoned the other sister of Jupiter, Ceres (Demeter),"
2432,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"properly a divinity of earth, and Neptune (Poseidon), ruler of the sea."
2433,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2434,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],=24. Jupiter[22] (Zeus).= The Greek name signifies the radiant light of
2435,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"heaven. Jupiter was the supreme ruler of the universe, wisest of the"
2436,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],divinities and most glorious. In the Iliad he informs the other gods
2437,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"that their united strength would not budge him: that, on the contrary,"
2438,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"he could draw them and earth and the seas to himself, and suspend all"
2439,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"from Olympus by a golden chain. Throned in the high, clear heavens,"
2440,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Jupiter was the gatherer of clouds and snows, the dispenser of gentle"
2441,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"rains and winds, the moderator of light and heat and the seasons, the"
2442,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"thunderer, the wielder of the thunderbolt. Bodily strength and valor"
2443,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],were dear to him. He was worshiped with various rites in different
2444,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"lands, and to him were sacred everywhere the loftiest trees and the"
2445,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],grandest mountain peaks. He required of his worshipers cleanliness
2446,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],of surroundings and person and heart. Justice was his; his to repay
2447,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"violation of duty in the family, in social relations, and in the state."
2448,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Prophecy was his; and his will was made known at the oracle of Dodona,"
2449,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],where answers were given to those who inquired concerning the future.
2450,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],This oracular shrine was the most ancient in Greece. According to one
2451,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],account two black doves had taken wing from Thebes in Egypt. One flew
2452,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"to Dodona in Epirus, and, alighting in a grove of oaks, proclaimed to"
2453,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],the inhabitants of the district that they should establish there an
2454,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],oracle of Jupiter. The other dove flew to the temple of Jupiter Ammon
2455,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"in the Libyan oasis, and delivered a similar command. According to"
2456,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"another account, these were not doves but priestesses who, carried off"
2457,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"from Thebes by the Ph[oe]nicians, set up oracles at Oasis and Dodona."
2458,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],The responses of the oracle were given by the rustling of the oak trees
2459,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],in the wind. The sounds were interpreted by priests.
2460,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2461,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],[Illustration: FIG. 7. ZEUS]
2462,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2463,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"That Jupiter himself, though wedded to the goddess Juno, should be"
2464,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"charged with numerous other love affairs, not only in respect of"
2465,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"goddesses but of mortals, is, in part, explained by the fact that"
2466,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],to the supreme divinity of the Greeks have been ascribed attributes
2467,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],and adventures of numerous local and foreign divinities that were
2468,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"gradually identified with him. It is, therefore, not wise to assume"
2469,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],that the love affairs of Jupiter and of other divinities always
2470,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],symbolize combinations of natural or physical forces that have repeated
2471,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],themselves in ever-varying guise. It is important to understand
2472,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],that the more ideal Olympian religion absorbed features of inferior
2473,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"religions, and that Jupiter, when represented as appropriating the"
2474,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"characteristics of other gods, was sometimes, also, accredited with"
2475,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],their wives.
2476,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2477,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Beside the children of Jupiter already enumerated, there should here be"
2478,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"mentioned, as of peculiar consequence, Bacchus (Dionysus), the god of"
2479,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"wine, a deity of earth,--Proserpine, the wife of Pluto and queen of the"
2480,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"underworld,--and Hercules, the greatest of the heroes."

2483,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2484,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],=25. Conceptions of Jupiter.= The Greeks usually conceived the Jupiter
2485,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of war as riding in his thunder-car, hurling the thunderbolt or"
2486,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],lashing his enemies with a scourge of lightning. He wore a breastplate
2487,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"or shield of storm-cloud like the skin of a gray goat (the _Ægis_),"
2488,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"fearful to behold, and made by the god of fire. His special messenger"
2489,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"was the eagle. It was, however, only with the passage of generations"
2490,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],that the Greeks came to represent their greatest of the gods by
2491,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],the works of men's hands. The statue of Olympian Jove by Phidias
2492,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],was considered the highest achievement of Grecian sculpture. It
2493,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"was of colossal dimensions and, like other statues of the period,"
2494,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"""chryselephantine,"" that is, composed of ivory and gold. For the parts"
2495,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"representing flesh were of ivory laid on a framework of wood, while the"
2496,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],drapery and ornaments were of gold. The height of the figure was forty
2497,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"feet, of the pedestal twelve. The god was represented as seated on his"
2498,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],throne. His brows were crowned with a wreath of olive; he held in his
2499,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"right hand a scepter, and in his left a statue of Victory. The throne"
2500,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"was of cedar, adorned with gold and precious stones."
2501,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2502,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],The idea which the artist essayed to embody was that of the supreme
2503,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"deity of the Hellenic race, enthroned as a conqueror, in perfect"
2504,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"majesty and repose, and ruling with a nod the subject world. Phidias"
2505,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],informs us that the idea was suggested by Homer's lines in the first
2506,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],book of the Iliad:
2507,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2508,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Jove said, and nodded with his shadowy brows;"
2509,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Waved on th' immortal head th' ambrosial locks,--"
2510,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],And all Olympus trembled at his nod.[23]
2511,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2512,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Unfortunately, our knowledge of this famous statue is confined to"
2513,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"literary descriptions, and to copies on coins. Other representations"
2514,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of Jove have been obtained from Greek bronze statuettes, or the"
2515,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],wall-paintings of Herculaneum and Pompeii.
2516,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2517,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"=26. Juno[24] (Hera)=, sister and wife of Jupiter. According to some,"
2518,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the name _Hera_ means Splendor of Heaven, according to others, the"
2519,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Lady. Some think it approves her goddess of earth; others, goddess"
2520,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of the air; still others, for reasons by no means final, say that it"
2521,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"signifies Protectress, and applies to Juno in her original function"
2522,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of moon-goddess, the chosen guardian of women, their aid in seasons"
2523,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],of distress. Juno's union with Jupiter was the prototype of earthly
2524,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],marriages. She is the type of matronly virtues and dignity.
2525,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2526,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],[Illustration: FIG. 9. HERA OF ARGOS]
2527,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2528,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"She was the daughter of Cronus and Rhea, but was brought up by Oceanus"
2529,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],and Tethys in their dwelling in the remote west beyond the sea. Without
2530,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the knowledge of her parents, she was wedded to Jupiter in this garden"
2531,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of the gods where ambrosial rivers flowed, and where Earth sent up in"
2532,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"honor of the rite a tree of life, heavy with apples golden like the"
2533,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"sunset. Juno was the most worthy of the goddesses, the most queenly;"
2534,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"ox-eyed, says Homer; says Hesiod, golden-sandaled and golden-throned."
2535,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Glorious beyond compare was her presence, when she had harnessed her"
2536,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"horses, and driven forth the golden-wheeled chariot that Hebe made"
2537,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"ready, and that the Hours set aside. Fearful, too, could be her wrath."
2538,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"For she was of a jealous disposition, which was not happily affected by"
2539,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the vagaries of her spouse; and she was, moreover, prone to quarrels,"
2540,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"self-willed, vengeful, proud, even on occasion deceitful. Once, indeed,"
2541,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],she conspired with Minerva and Neptune to bind the cloud-compeller
2542,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],himself. More than once she provoked him to blows; and once to worse
2543,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"than blows,--for her lord and master swung her aloft in the clouds,"
2544,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],securing her wrists in golden handcuffs and hanging anvils to her feet.
2545,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2546,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"The cities that the ox-eyed goddess favored were Argos, Sparta, and"
2547,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Mycenæ. To her the peacock and the cow were dear, and many a grove and"
2548,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],pasture rejoiced her sacred herds.

2553,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2554,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"=27. Minerva= (=Athene= or =Athena=), the virgin goddess. She sprang"
2555,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"from the brain of Jove, agleam with panoply of war, brandishing a"
2556,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],spear and with her battle-cry awakening the echoes of heaven and
2557,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],earth. She is goddess of the lightning that leaps like a lance from
2558,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the cloud-heavy sky, and hence, probably, the name _Athene_.[25] She"
2559,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"is goddess of the storms and of the rushing thunderbolt, and is,"
2560,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"therefore, styled Pallas. She is the goddess of the thundercloud,"
2561,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"which is symbolized by her tasseled breastplate of goatskin, the"
2562,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"_ægis_, whereon is fixed the head of Medusa, the Gorgon, that turns"
2563,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"to stone all beholders. She is also the goddess of war, rejoicing"
2564,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],in martial music and protecting the war horse and the warship. On
2565,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the other hand, she is of a gentle, fair, and thoughtful aspect. Her"
2566,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Latin name _Minerva_ is connected with the Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin"
2567,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"words for _mind_. She is eternally a virgin, the goddess of wisdom, of"
2568,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"skill, of contemplation, of spinning and weaving, of horticulture and"
2569,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"agriculture. She is protectress of cities, and was specially worshiped"
2570,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"in her own Athens, in Argos, in Sparta, and in Troy. To her were"
2571,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"sacrificed oxen and cows. The olive tree, created by her, was sacred to"
2572,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"her, and also the owl, the cock, the serpent, and the crow."
2573,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2574,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"=28. Mars (Ares)=,[26] the war-god, son of Jupiter and Juno."
2575,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],The meaning of the name _Ares_ is uncertain; the most probable
2576,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"significations are the _Slayer_, the _Avenger_, the _Curse_. The"
2577,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Roman god of war, Mars, is the _bright_ and _burning_ one. Homer, in"
2578,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the Iliad, represents Ares as the insatiable warrior of the heroic"
2579,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"age, who, impelled by rage and lust of violence, exults in the noise"
2580,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of battle, revels in the horror of carnage. Strife and slaughter"
2581,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"are the condition of his existence. Where the fight is thickest,"
2582,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"there he rushes in without hesitation, without question as to which"
2583,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"side is right. In battle array he is resplendent,--on his head the"
2584,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"gleaming helmet and floating plume, on his arm the leathern shield,"
2585,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"in his hand the redoubtable spear of bronze. Well-favored, stately,"
2586,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"swift, unwearied, puissant, gigantic, he is still the foe of wisdom,"
2587,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the scourge of mortals. Usually he fights on foot, sometimes from a"
2588,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"chariot drawn by four horses,--the offspring of the North Wind and"
2589,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"a Fury. In the fray his sons attend him,--Terror, Trembling, Panic,"
2590,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"and Fear,--also his sister Eris, or Discord (the mother of Strife),"
2591,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"his daughter Enyo, ruiner of cities, and a retinue of bloodthirsty"
2592,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"demons. As typifying the chances of war, Mars is, of course, not always"
2593,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"successful. In the battles before Troy, Minerva and Juno bring him more"
2594,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"than once to grief; and when he complains to Jupiter, he is snubbed as"
2595,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],a renegade most hateful of all the gods.[27] His loved one and mistress
2596,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],is the goddess of beauty herself. In her arms the warrior finds repose.
2597,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Their daughter Harmonia is the ancestress of the unquiet dynasty of
2598,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Thebes. The favorite land of Mars was, according to Homer, the rough,"
2599,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],northerly Thrace. His emblems are the spear and the burning torch; his
2600,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"chosen animals are haunters of the battle field,--the vulture and the"
2601,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],dog.

2605,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"=29. Vulcan (Hephæstus)=, son of Jupiter and Juno, was the god of fire,"
2606,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"especially of terrestrial fire,--volcanic eruption, incendiary flame,"
2607,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],the glow of the forge or the hearth. But as the fires of earth are
2608,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"derived from that of heaven, perhaps the name _Hephæstus_ (burning,"
2609,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"shining, flaming) referred originally to the marvelous brilliance"
2610,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of the lightning. Vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods, the finest"
2611,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],artificer in metal among them. His forge in Olympus was furnished
2612,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"not only with anvils and all other implements of the trade, but with"
2613,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"automatic handmaidens of silver and gold, fashioned by Vulcan himself."
2614,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Poets later than Homer assign to Vulcan workshops under various
2615,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],volcanic islands. From the crater of Mount Ætna poured forth the fumes
2616,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],and flames of his smithy. He built the dwellings of the gods; he made
2617,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the scepter of Jove, the shields and spears of the Olympians, the"
2618,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"arrows of Apollo and Diana, the breastplate of Hercules, the shield of"

2625,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"he was born halt; and his mother, chagrined by his deformity, cast"
2626,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"him from Heaven out of the sight of the gods. Yet, again,[29] he says"
2627,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"that, attempting once to save his mother from Jupiter's wrath, he was"

2630,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"little life was left in me."" Had he not been lame before, he had good"
2631,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],reason to limp after either of these catastrophes. He took part in the
2632,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"making of the human race, and in the special creation of Pandora. He"

2650,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],preëminently the god of the sun. His name _Ph[oe]bus_ signifies the
2651,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"radiant nature of the sunlight; his name _Apollo_, perhaps, the cruel"

2661,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"god in his chariot drawn by swans,--heralded by songs of springtide,"
2662,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],of nightingales and swallows and crickets. Then the crystal fount
2663,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of Castalia and the stream Cephissus overflowed their bounds, and"
2664,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],mankind made grateful offerings to the god. But his advent was not

2666,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the slime with which, after the flood, the Earth was covered; and in"
2667,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],the caves of Mount Parnassus this terror of the people lurked. Him
2668,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Apollo encountered and after fearful combat slew, with arrows, weapons"
2669,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],which the god of the silver bow had not before used against any but
2670,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"feeble animals,--hares, wild goats, and such game. In commemoration"
2671,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of this illustrious conquest, he instituted the Pythian games, in"
2672,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"which the victor in feats of strength, swiftness of foot, or in the"
2673,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"chariot race, should be crowned with a wreath of beech leaves. Apollo"
2674,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"brought not only the warm spring and summer, but also the blessings"
2675,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],of the harvest. He warded off the dangers and diseases of summer and
2676,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],autumn; and he healed the sick. He was patron of music and of poetry.
2677,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Through his oracle at Delphi, on the slopes of Parnassus in Phocis, the"
2678,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Pythian god made known the future to those who consulted him. He was a
2679,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"founder of cities, a promoter of colonization, a giver of good laws,"
2680,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the ideal of fair and manly youth,--a pure and just god, requiring"
2681,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],clean hands and pure hearts of those that worshiped him. But though a
2682,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"god of life and peace, the far-darter did not shun the weapons of war."
2683,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"When presumption was to be punished, or wrong righted, he could bend"
2684,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],his bow and slay with the arrows of his sunlight. As in the days of his
2685,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"youth he slew the Python, so, also, he slew the froward Tityus, and so"
2686,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],the children of Niobe. While Ph[oe]bus Apollo is the Olympian divinity
2687,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of the sun, fraught with light and healing, spiritual, creative, and"
2688,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"prophetic, he must not be confounded with a god of the older dynasty,"
2689,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Helios (offspring of Hyperion, Titanic deity of light), who represented"
2690,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the sun in its daily and yearly course, in its physical rather than"
2691,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],spiritual manifestation. The bow of Apollo was bound with laurel in
2692,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"memory of Daphne, whom he loved. To him were sacred, also, many"
2693,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"creatures,--the wolf, the roe, the mouse, the he-goat, the ram, the"
2694,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"dolphin, and the swan.[30]"

2746,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"=32. Diana (Artemis)=, twin sister of Apollo, was born on Mount"
2747,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Cynthus in the island of Delos. Latona, the future mother of Diana"
2748,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"and Apollo, flying from the wrath of Juno, had besought, one after"
2749,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"another, the islands of the Ægean to afford her a place of rest; but"
2750,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],they feared too much the potent queen of heaven. Delos alone consented
2751,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],to become the birthplace of the future deities. This isle was then
2752,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"floating and unstable; but on Latona's arrival, Jupiter fastened it"
2753,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"with adamantine chains to the bottom of the sea, that it might be a"
2754,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"secure resting-place for his beloved. The daughter of Latona is, as"
2755,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"her name _Artemis_ indicates, a virgin goddess, the ideal of modesty,"
2756,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"grace, and maidenly vigor. She is associated with her brother, the"
2757,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"prince of archery, in nearly all his adventures, and in attributes she"
2758,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"is his feminine counterpart. As he is identified with sunlight, so is"
2759,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"she, his fair-tressed sister, with the chaste brilliance of the moon."
2760,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Its slender arc is her bow; its beams are her arrows with which she
2761,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],sends upon womankind a speedy and painless death. In her prerogative
2762,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of moon-goddess she is frequently identified with Selene, daughter"
2763,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of Hyperion, just as Apollo is with Helios. Despising the weakness"
2764,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of love, Diana imposed upon her nymphs vows of perpetual maidenhood,"
2765,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],any violation of which she was swift and severe to punish. Graceful
2766,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"in form and free of movement, equipped for the chase, and surrounded"
2767,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"by a bevy of fair companions, the swift-rushing goddess was wont to"
2768,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"scour hill, valley, forest, and plain. She was, however, not only"
2769,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"huntress, but guardian, of wild beasts,--mistress withal of horses"
2770,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],and kine and other domestic brutes. She ruled marsh and mountain; her
2771,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],gleaming arrows smote sea as well as land. Springs and woodland brooks
2772,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"she favored, for in them she and her attendants were accustomed to"
2773,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"bathe. She blessed with verdure the meadows and arable lands, and from"
2774,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],them obtained a meed of thanks. When weary of the chase she turned to
2775,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],music and dancing; for the lyre and flute and song were dear to her.
2776,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Muses, Graces, nymphs, and the fair goddesses themselves thronged the"
2777,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],rites of the chorus-leading queen. But ordinarily a woodland chapel
2778,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],or a rustic altar sufficed for her worship. There the hunter laid his
2779,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"offering--antlers, skin, or edible portions of the deer that Artemis of"
2780,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the golden arrows had herself vouchsafed him. The holy maid, however,"
2781,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"though naturally gracious, gentle, and a healer of ills, was, like"
2782,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"her brother, quick to resent injury to her sacred herds or insult"
2783,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"to herself. To this stern temper Agamemnon, Orion, and Niobe bore"
2784,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"regretful testimony. They found that the ""fair-crowned queen of the"
2785,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"echoing chase,"" though blithe and gracious, was by no means a frivolous"

2821,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the more ancient Greek conception, a daughter of Jupiter and Dione;[32]"
2822,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],but Hesiod says that she arose from the foam of the sea at the time
2823,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of the wounding of Uranus, and therefore was called, by the Greeks,"
2824,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Aphrodite, _the foam-born_.[33] Wafted by the west wind, and borne"
2825,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"upon the surge, she won first the island of Cythera; thence, like a"
2826,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"dream, she passed to Cyprus, where the grace and blossom of her beauty"
2827,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"conquered every heart. Everywhere, at the touch of her feet the herbage"
2828,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"quivered into flower. The Hours and Graces surrounded her, twining"
2829,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],odorous garlands and weaving robes for her that reflected the hues and
2830,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"breathed the perfume of crocus and hyacinth, violet, rose, lily, and"
2831,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],narcissus. To her influence is ascribed the fruitfulness of the animal
2832,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"and of the vegetable creation. She is goddess of gardens and flowers,"
2833,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of the rose, the myrtle, and the linden. The heaths and slumberous"
2834,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"vales, pleasant with spring and vernal breezes, are hers. In her"
2835,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"broidered girdle lurk ""love and desire, and loving converse that steals"

2837,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"and beauty, the golden, sweetly smiling Aphrodite, who rules the hearts"
2838,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"of men. She lends to mortals seductive form and fascination. To a few,"
2839,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"indeed, her favor is a blessing; but to many her gifts are treacherous,"
2840,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],destructive of peace. Her various influence is exemplified in the
2841,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"stories of Pygmalion and Adonis, Paris and Æneas, Helen, Ariadne,"
2842,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Psyche, Procris, Pasiphaë, and Phædra. Her power extended over sea as"
2843,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"well as land, and her temples rose from many a shore. On the waters"
2844,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"swan and dolphin were beloved of her; in air, the sparrow and the dove."
2845,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"She was usually attended by her winged son Cupid, of whom much is to"

2919,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],was the son of Jupiter and Maia (the daughter of Atlas). According to
2920,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"conjecture, his name _Hermes_ means the _Hastener_. Mercury, swift as"

2925,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"by wings, and possessed of magical powers over sleeping, waking, and"

2930,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the forerunner, too, of mathematicians and astronomers. His agility"

2947,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"flattering advances of both Neptune and Apollo, and resolved to remain"
2948,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"single. Whereupon Jupiter gave her to sit in the middle of his palace,"
2949,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"to receive in Olympus the choicest morsels of the feast, and, in the"
2950,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"temples of the gods on earth, reverence as the oldest and worthiest of"
2951,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Olympian divinities. As goddess of the burning hearth, Vesta is the"
2952,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"divinity of the home: of settled, in opposition to nomadic, habits of"
2953,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],life. She was worshiped first of the gods at every feast. Before her
2954,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],shrine in city and state the holy flame was religiously cherished.
2955,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],From her altars those of the other gods obtained their fires. No new
2956,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"colony, no new home, was duly consecrated till on its central hearth"
2957,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],there glowed coals from her ancestral hearth. In her temple at Rome a
2958,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"sacred fire, tended by six virgin priestesses called Vestals, was kept"
2959,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],religiously aflame. As the safety of the city was held to be connected
2960,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"with its conservation, any negligence, by which it might go out, was"
2961,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"severely punished. Whenever the fire did die, it was rekindled from the"
2962,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],rays of the sun.

2964,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],=38.= Of the =Lesser Divinities of Heaven= the most worthy of mention
2965,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],are:
2966,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2967,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"1. _Cupid (Eros)_, small but mighty god of love, the son of Venus and"
2968,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],her constant companion. He was often represented with eyes covered
2969,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"because of the blindness of his actions. With his bow and arrows, he"
2970,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],shot the darts of desire into the bosoms of gods and men. Another deity
2971,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"named _Anteros_, reputed the brother of Eros, was sometimes represented"
2972,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"as the avenger of slighted love, and sometimes as the symbol of"
2973,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],reciprocal affection. Venus was also attended at times by another
2974,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"brother of Eros, _Himeros_, or Longing, and by _Hymen_, a beautiful"
2975,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"youth of divine descent, the personification of the wedding feast and"
2976,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],leader of the nuptial chorus. Of Eros the poet Gosse writes:

2981,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Far down a somber autumn glade,"
2982,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],I found the god of love;
2983,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His bow and arrows cast aside,"
2984,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His lovely arms extended wide,"
2985,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"A depth of leaves above,"
2986,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Beneath o'erarching boughs he made
2987,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],A place for sleep in russet shade.
2988,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2989,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"His lips, more red than any rose,"
2990,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Were like a flower that overflows
2991,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],With honey pure and sweet;
2992,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"And clustering round that holy mouth,"
2993,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],The golden bees in eager drouth
2994,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Plied busy wings and feet;
2995,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"They knew, what every lover knows,"
2996,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],There's no such honey-bloom that blows.[38]
2997,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
2998,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"2. _Hebe_, daughter of Jupiter and Juno, goddess of youth and cupbearer"
2999,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"to the gods. According to one story, she resigned that office on"
3000,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"becoming the wife of Hercules. According to another, Hebe was dismissed"
3001,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],from her position in consequence of a fall which she met with one day
3002,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"when in attendance on the gods. Her successor was _Ganymede_, a Trojan"
3003,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"boy whom Jupiter, in the disguise of an eagle, seized and carried off"
3004,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"from the midst of his playfellows on Mount Ida, bore up to Heaven, and"
3005,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],installed in the vacant place.
3006,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
3007,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"3. _The Graces_, daughters of Jove by Eurynome, daughter of Oceanus."
3008,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"They were goddesses presiding over the banquet, the dance, all"
3009,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"social pleasures, and polite accomplishments. They were three in"
3010,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"number,--Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia. Spenser describes the office"
3011,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],of the Graces thus:
3012,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
3013,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],These three on men all gracious gifts bestow
3014,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Which deck the body or adorn the mind,"
3015,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],To make them lovely or well-favored show;
3016,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"As comely carriage, entertainment kind,"
3017,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Sweet semblance, friendly offices that bind,"
3018,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],And all the complements of courtesy;
3019,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],They teach us how to each degree and kind
3020,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"We should ourselves demean, to low, to high,"
3021,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"To friends, to foes; which skill men call civility."

3025,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"4. _The Muses_, daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory). They"
3026,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],presided over song and prompted the memory. They are ordinarily cited
3027,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],as nine in number; and to each of them was assigned patronage in some
3028,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"department of literature, art, or science. Calliope was the muse of"
3029,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"epic poetry, Clio of history, Euterpe of lyric poetry, Melpomene of"
3030,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"tragedy, Terpsichore of choral dance and song, Erato of love poetry,"
3031,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Polyhymnia of sacred poetry, Urania of astronomy, Thalia of comedy."

3034,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
3035,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"5. _Themis_, one of the Titans, a daughter of Uranus. She sat, as"
3036,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"goddess of justice, beside Jupiter on his throne. She was beloved of"
3037,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the father of gods and men, and bore him the Hours, goddesses who"

3044,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"6. _The Fates_, three in number,--Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. Their"
3045,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"office was to spin the thread of human destiny, and they were provided"
3046,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],with shears with which they cut it off when they pleased.[39] According
3047,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"to Hesiod, they were daughters of Night."
3048,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
3049,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"7. _Nemesis_, daughter of Night. She represented the righteous anger"
3050,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"and vengeance of the gods, particularly toward the proud, the insolent,"
3051,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],and breakers of the law.
3052,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
3053,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"8. _Æsculapius_, son of Apollo. By his skill in medicine he restored"
3054,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"the dead to life. Being killed by the lightning of Jove, he was"
3055,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],translated to the ranks of Heaven. His function was the art of healing.
3056,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],
3057,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"9. _The Winds_,--Boreas, or Aquilo, the north wind; Zephyrus, or"
3058,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Favonius, the west; Notus, or Auster, the south; and Eurus, the east."
3059,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"The first two, chiefly, have been celebrated by the poets, the former"
3060,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"as the type of rudeness, the latter of gentleness. It is said that"
3061,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Boreas loved the nymph Orithyia and tried to play the lover's part, but"
3062,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"met with poor success; for it was hard for him to breathe gently, and"

3065,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Weary at last of fruitless endeavors, he acted out his true character,"
3066,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],seized the maiden and bore her off. Their children were Zetes and
3067,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Calaïs, winged warriors, who accompanied the Argonautic expedition"
3068,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"and did good service in an encounter with those monstrous birds, the"

3073,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Here, too, may be mentioned Æolus, the king of the winds, although he"
3074,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],is not a lesser divinity of Heaven. His palace was on the precipitous
3075,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"isle of Æolia, where, with his six sons and six daughters, he kept"
3076,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"eternal carouse. The winds, which he confined in a cavern, he let loose"
3077,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],as he saw fit or as he was bidden by superior deities. He is sometimes

3083,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],Helios and Selene were the more ancient Greek divinities of Sun and
3084,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"Moon respectively. Helios, the charioteer of the sun, is, as has been"
3085,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"already said, frequently identified with his successor, Apollo. The"
3086,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],attributes and adventures of Selene were merged in those of the more
3087,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"modern Diana. Eos, or, in Latin nomenclature, Aurora, the rosy-fingered"
3088,THE GODS OF HEAVEN[16],"goddess of the Morn, was mother of the stars and of the morning and"

3263,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],death and of the lower world. Of the institutions founded or favored
3264,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"by her the most important were the mysteries celebrated at Eleusis,"
3265,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"concerning which we know that, in the presence of individuals initiated"
3266,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"in the secret ritual and perhaps with their coöperation, scenes were"
3267,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],enacted which represented the alternation of death and life in nature
3268,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"and, apparently, forecast the resurrection and immortality of man."
3269,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],Sacred to Ceres and to Proserpine were golden sheaves of corn and
3270,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"soporific poppies; while, among animals, cows, sheep, and pigs were"
3271,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],acceptable to them.

3276,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"order of gods; so also, another goddess of the earth, _Rhea_, the wife"
3277,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"of Cronus and mother of Jupiter. In Phrygia, Rhea became identified"
3278,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"with _Cybele_, whose worship, as mother of the gods, was at a later"
3279,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"period introduced into Rome. The Greek mother, Rhea, was attended by"
3280,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"the Curetes; the Phrygian mother by the Corybantes, who celebrated her"
3281,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"orgies with enthusiastic din of trumpets, drums, and cymbals. Cybele"
3282,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],presided over mountain fastnesses and fortified places.
3283,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],
3284,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"=42. Bacchus (Dionysus)=, the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter and"
3285,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Semele, daughter of Cadmus of Thebes. He was especially the god of"
3286,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],animal life and vegetation. He represented not only the intoxicating
3287,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"power of wine but its social and beneficent influences, and was"
3288,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"looked upon as a promoter of civilization, a lawgiver, and a lover"
3289,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],of peace. His forehead was crowned with vine leaves or ivy. He rode
3290,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"upon the tiger, the panther, or the lynx, or was drawn by them in a"
3291,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"car. His worshipers were Bacchanals, or Bacchantes. He was attended by"
3292,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Satyrs and Sileni and by women called Mænads, who, as they danced and"
3293,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"sang, waved in the air the _thyrsus_, a staff entwined with ivy and"
3294,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"surmounted by a pine cone. Ordinarily, as in the following verses by"
3295,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Dryden, the convivial qualities of the god overshadow all the rest:"
3296,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],
3297,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung,"
3298,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Of Bacchus ever fair, and ever young."
3299,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],The jolly god in triumph comes;

3301,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],Flushed with a purple grace
3302,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],He shows his honest face:
3303,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes."
3304,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Bacchus, ever fair and young,"
3305,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],Drinking joys did first ordain;
3306,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Bacchus' blessings are a treasure,"
3307,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],Drinking is the soldier's pleasure;
3308,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Rich the treasure,"
3309,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"Sweet the pleasure,"

3314,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],=43. The Lesser Divinities of Earth= were:
3315,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],
3316,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"1. _Pan_, son of Mercury and a wood-nymph or Dryad. He was the god"
3317,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"of woods and fields, of flocks and shepherds. He dwelt in caves,"
3318,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"wandered on the mountains and in valleys, amused himself with the"
3319,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"chase, led the dances of the Dryads, and made love to them. But his"
3320,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"suit was frequently of no avail, for though good-natured he was not"
3321,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],prepossessing; his hoofs and horns did not enhance his comeliness. He
3322,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"was fond of music and was himself inventor of the syrinx, or shepherd's"
3323,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"pipe, which he played in a masterly manner. Like other gods who dwelt"
3324,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"in forests, he was dreaded by those whose occupations caused them to"
3325,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],pass through the woods by night; for gloom and loneliness oppress and
3326,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],appall the mind. Hence sudden unreasonable fright was ascribed to Pan
3327,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],and called a Panic terror.
3328,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],
3329,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"2. _The Nymphs._ Pan's partners in the dance, the Dryads, were but one"
3330,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"of several classes of nymphs. There were, beside them, the Oreads,"
3331,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"nymphs of mountains and grottoes; and the Water-Nymphs, who are"
3332,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],mentioned in later sections.
3333,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],
3334,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"3. _The Satyrs_, deities of the woods and fields. In early art they"
3335,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"appear as bearded creatures with snub noses, goats' ears, and horses'"
3336,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],"tails. Later they resemble youths, sometimes with sprouting horns. The"
3337,THE GODS OF EARTH[41],goat-legged satyr is found in Roman poetry.

3359,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"spirits of the dead and governed by Pluto (Hades) and Proserpina, his"
3360,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"queen. According to the Iliad, this realm lay ""beneath the secret"
3361,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"places of the earth.""[45] And from the Odyssey we gather that it is not"
3362,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"in the bowels of the earth, but on the under side at the limits of the"
3363,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"known world, across the stream Oceanus, where is a waste shore, the"
3364,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"land of the Cimmerians, shrouded in mist and cloud, never lighted by"
3365,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"the sun ""neither when he climbs up the starry heavens nor when again"
3366,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"he turns earthward from the firmament.""[46] From that land one goes"
3367,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],beside the stream till he reaches the dank house of Hades. The realm
3368,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"of darkness is bounded by awful rivers: the Styx, sacred even among"
3369,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"the gods, for by it they sealed their oaths, and the Acheron, river of"
3370,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"woe,--with its tributaries, Phlegethon, river of fire, and Cocytus,"
3371,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"river of wailing. Hither past the White Rock, which perhaps symbolizes"
3372,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"the bleaching skeletons of the dead, and past the gates of the sun,"
3373,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],it is the duty of Hermes (Mercury) to conduct the outworn ghosts of
3374,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"mortals. One of the Greek dramatists, Sophocles, tells us that this"
3375,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"shore of death is ""down in the darkling west.""[47] In later poems we"
3376,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"read that Charon, a grim boatman, received the dead at the River of"
3377,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"Woe, and ferried them across, if the money requisite for their passage"
3378,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],had been placed in their mouths and their bodies had been duly buried
3379,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],in the world above.[48] Otherwise he left them gibbering on the hither
3380,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],bank. The abode of Pluto is represented as wide-gated and thronged
3381,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"with guests. At the gate Cerberus, a three-headed, serpent-tailed dog,"
3382,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"lay on guard,--friendly to the spirits entering, but inimical to those"
3383,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"who would depart. The palace itself is dark and gloomy, set in the"
3384,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],midst of uncanny fields haunted by strange apparitions. The groves of
3385,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"somber trees about the palace,--the meads of Asphodel, barren or, at"
3386,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"best, studded with futile bushes and pale-flowered weeds, where wander"
3387,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"the shades,--and the woods along the waste shore ""of tall poplars and"
3388,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"willows that shed their fruit before the season"" are, without any"
3389,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"particular discrimination, celebrated by the poets as the _Garden of"

3464,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"living might but rarely communicate, and only through certain oracles"
3465,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"of the dead, situate by cavernous spots and sheer abysms, deep and"
3466,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"melancholy streams, and baleful marshes. These naturally seemed to"
3467,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"afford access to the world below, which with the later poets, such as"
3468,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"Virgil, comes to be regarded as under the ground. One of these descents"
3469,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"to the Underworld was near Tænarum in Laconia; another, near Cumæ in"
3470,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"Italy, was Lake Avernus, so foul in its exhalations that, as its name"

3472,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"lower world,--Minos, Æacus, and Rhadamanthus,--the souls of the dead"

3491,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],Fortunate Isles. From this dream of a western Elysium may have sprung
3492,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],the legend of the island Atlantis. That blissful region may have been
3493,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"wholly imaginary. It is, however, not impossible that the myth had"
3494,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],its origin in the reports of storm-driven mariners who had caught a
3495,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"glimpse of occidental lands. In these Islands of the Blest, the Titans,"
3496,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"released from Tartarus after many years, dwelt under the golden sway of"

3531,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"By virtue of the helmet or cap given him by the Cyclopes, he moved"

3533,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"lord not only of all that descends to the bowels of the earth, but"
3534,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],of all that proceeds from the earth; and in the latter aspect he was
3535,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"revered as Pluto, or the giver of wealth. At his pleasure he visited"
3536,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"the realms of day,--as when he carried off Proserpina; occasionally he"

3539,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"Mortals, when they called on his name, beat the ground with their hands"
3540,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"and, averting their faces, sacrificed black sheep to him and to his"

3545,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],
3546,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],=48. Proserpina (Persephone)= was the daughter of Ceres and Jupiter.
3547,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"She was queen of Hades,--a name applied both to the ruler of the shades"
3548,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"and to his realm. When she is goddess of spring, dear to mankind,"
3549,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"Proserpina bears a cornucopia overflowing with flowers, and revisits"
3550,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"the earth in duly recurring season. But when she is goddess of death,"
3551,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"sitting beside Pluto, she directs the Furies, and, like her husband, is"
3552,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"cruel, unyielding, inimical to youth and life and hope. In the story of"
3553,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],her descent to Hades will be found a further account of her attributes
3554,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],and fortunes.
3555,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],
3556,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],=49. The Lesser Divinities of the Underworld= were:
3557,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],
3558,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"1. _Æacus_, _Rhadamanthus_, and _Minos_, sons of Jupiter and judges of"
3559,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],the shades in the lower world. Æacus had been during his earthly life a
3560,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],righteous king of the island of Ægina. Minos had been a famous lawgiver
3561,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],and king of Crete. The life of Rhadamanthus was not eventful.
3562,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],
3563,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"2. _The Furies_ (_Erinyes_ or _Eumenides_), Alecto, Tisiphone, and"
3564,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"Megæra, born of the blood of the wounded Uranus. They were attendants"
3565,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],of Proserpina. They punished with the frenzies of remorse the crimes of
3566,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],those who had escaped from or defied public justice. The heads of the
3567,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],Furies were wreathed with serpents.
3568,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],
3569,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"3. _Hecate_, a mysterious divinity sometimes identified with Diana and"
3570,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],sometimes with Proserpina. As Diana represents the moonlight splendor
3571,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"of night, so Hecate represents its darkness and terrors. She haunted"
3572,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"crossroads and graveyards, was the goddess of sorcery and witchcraft,"
3573,THE GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD[44],"and wandered by night, seen only by the dogs whose barking told of her"

3580,TOMB],Night.[54] They dwell in subterranean darkness. The former brings to
3581,TOMB],"mortals solace and fair dreams, and can lull the shining eyes of Jove"

3626,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3627,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],=50. The Older Dynasty.= There were two dynasties of the sea. The
3628,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Older, which flourished during the rule of Cronus, was founded by the"
3629,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Titans, _Oceanus_ and _Tethys_, from whom sprang three thousand rivers"
3630,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],and ocean-nymphs unnumbered. The palace of Oceanus was beyond the
3631,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"limits of the bountiful earth,[58] surrounded by gardens and all things"
3632,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],fair. From ages immemorial another dweller in the glimmering caves of
3633,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Ocean was _Pontus_ (the _deep sea_ or the _waterway_), who became, by"
3634,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Mother Earth, father of Nereus. This _Nereus_, a genial old man of the"
3635,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"sea, was distinguished for his prophetic gifts, his knowledge, his love"
3636,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"of truth and justice. Taking to wife one of the daughters of Oceanus,"
3637,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"the nymph Doris, he was blessed with a family of fifty fair daughters,"
3638,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"the _Nereïds_.[59] Of these daughters the most famous are Panope,"
3639,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Galatea, Thetis, and Amphitrite; the last of whom gave her hand to"
3640,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Neptune (Poseidon), brother of Jove, and thus united the Older and the"
3641,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],Younger dynasties of the sea.
3642,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3643,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],=51.= Of the =Younger Dynasty= of the waters _Neptune_ and _Amphitrite_
3644,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"were the founders. Neptune's palace was in the depths of the sea,"
3645,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],near Ægæ in Eub[oe]a; but he made his home on Olympus when he chose.
3646,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"The symbol of his power was the trident, or three-pronged spear,"
3647,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"with which he could shatter rocks, call forth or subdue storms, and"
3648,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],shake the shores of earth. He created the horse and was the patron of
3649,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],horse races. His own steeds were brazen-hoofed and golden-maned. They
3650,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"drew his chariot over the sea, which became smooth before him, while"
3651,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],dolphins and other monsters of the deep gamboled about his path. In his
3652,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"honor black and white bulls, white boars, and rams were sacrificed."

3655,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3656,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],=52. The Lesser Divinities of= =the Waters=[60] were:
3657,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3658,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"1. _Triton_, the son of Neptune and Amphitrite, trumpeter of Ocean. By"
3659,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],his blast on the sea-shell he stirred or allayed the waves.
3660,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3661,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"2. _Proteus_, an attendant and, according to certain traditions, a"
3662,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"son of Neptune. Like Nereus, he was a little old man of the sea. He"
3663,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],possessed the prophetic gift and the power of changing his shape at
3664,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],will.
3665,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3666,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"3. _The Harpies_, foul creatures, with heads of maidens, bodies, wings,"
3667,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"and claws of birds, and faces pale with hunger. They are the offspring"
3668,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"of Thaumas, a son of Pontus and Gæa."
3669,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3670,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"4. The uncanny offspring of Phorcys and Ceto,--children of Pontus,--who"
3671,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],rejoiced in the horrors of the sea:
3672,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3673,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"_a. The Grææ_, three hoary witches, with one eye between them which"
3674,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],they used in turn.
3675,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3676,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"_b. The Gorgons_, whose glance was icy death."
3677,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3678,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"_c. The Sirens_, muses of the sea and of death, who by their sweet"
3679,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],singing enticed seafarers to destruction.
3680,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3681,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"_d. Scylla_, also destructive to mariners, a six-headed monster whose"
3682,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],lower limbs were serpents and ever-barking dogs.

3685,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3686,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"5. _Atlas_, who stood in the far west, bearing on his shoulders the"
3687,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"vault of heaven. He was once regarded as a divinity of the sea, but"
3688,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],later as a mountain. He was the son of Iapetus and the father of three
3689,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"classes of nymphs,--the Pleiads, the Hyads, and, according to some"
3690,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"stories, the Hesperids. The last-mentioned, assisted by their mother"
3691,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Hesperis and a dragon, guarded the golden apples of the tree that had"
3692,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],sprung up to grace the wedding of Jove and Juno. The daughters of Atlas
3693,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],were not themselves divinities of the sea.
3694,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3695,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"6. _The Water-Nymphs._ Beside the _Oceanids_ and the _Nereïds_, who"
3696,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"have already been mentioned, of most importance were the _Naiads_,"
3697,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],daughters of Jupiter. They presided over brooks and fountains. Other
3698,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"lesser powers of the Ocean were Glaucus, Leucothea, and Melicertes, of"
3699,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],whom more is said in another section.
3700,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3701,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],In the following statement of the difference between ancient and modern
3702,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"conceptions of nature, the poet lends new charm to the fabled rulers of"
3703,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],the sea.
3704,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],
3705,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"The world is too much with us; late and soon,"
3706,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:"
3707,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],Little we see in Nature that is ours;
3708,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!"
3709,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],This sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
3710,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"The winds that will be howling at all hours,"
3711,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],And are upgathered now like sleeping flowers;
3712,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"For this, for everything, we are out of tune;"
3713,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],It moves us not.--Great God! I'd rather be
3714,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
3715,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],"So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,"
3716,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
3717,THE GODS OF THE WATERS[57],Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;

3741,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,=53. Gods Common to Greece and Italy.= Of the deities already
3742,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"mentioned, the following, although they were later identified with"
3743,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,certain Greek gods and goddesses[62] whose characteristics and
3744,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"adventures they assumed, had developed an independent worship in Italy:"
3745,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Jupiter (Zeus); Juno (Hera); Minerva (Athene); Diana (Artemis); Mars
3746,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"(Ares); Venus (Aphrodite); Vulcanus, or Mulciber (Hephæstus); Vesta"
3747,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,(Hestia); Mercurius (Hermes); Neptunus (Poseidon); Ceres (Demeter);
3748,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Liber (Bacchus); Libera (Persephone); Magna Mater, the great mother of"
3749,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"the gods (Rhea, Cybele); Orcus (Pluto, Hades); Tellus, the Earth (Gæa)."
3750,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3751,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,=54. Italian Gods.= There were also divinities always peculiar to Roman
3752,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,mythology.[63] Of these the more important are:
3753,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3754,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"1. _Saturn_, an ancient Italian deity (as his name indicates) of seeds"
3755,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"and sowing, the introducer of agriculture. Fanciful attempts were"
3756,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,made to identify him with the Grecian god Cronus; and it was fabled
3757,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"that after his dethronement by Jupiter he fled to Italy, where he"
3758,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"reigned during the Golden Age. In memory of his dominion, the feast of"
3759,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Saturnalia was held every year in the winter season. Then all public
3760,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,business was suspended; declarations of war and criminal executions
3761,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,were postponed; friends made presents to one another; and even slaves
3762,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,were indulged with great liberties. A feast was given them at which
3763,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"they sat at table while their masters served, to show the natural"
3764,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"equality of men, and that all things belonged equally to all in the"
3765,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"reign of Saturn. The wife of Saturn was _Ops_, goddess of sowing and"
3766,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,harvest (later confounded with Rhea). Another Roman deity of earth was
3767,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"_Consus_, whose name means ""the keeper of the stores."" He is the god"
3768,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,of the stored-up harvest; and his altar is said to have been discovered
3769,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,underground by Romulus. It was in the Circus Maximus and was uncovered
3770,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"only on the days of his festivals, the harvest home of August and the"
3771,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,granary feast of December. The underground altar is a reminiscence
3772,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,of the ancient custom of storing corn underground or at any rate of
3773,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,burying the sacrifices offered to deities of the earth. The harvest
3774,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"festival was celebrated with horse races, which, originating in a very"
3775,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"simple way with the primitive farmers, became in time the distinctive"
3776,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,feature of the Circus Maximus.
3777,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3778,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,[Illustration: FIG. 43. BEARDED JANUS]
3779,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3780,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"2. _Janus_, whose name is derived from the Latin root which means"
3781,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"""going"" and is connected with _janua_, a passage or door, is the most"
3782,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,distinctive and most important of the native Italic deities. He is
3783,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"not only the god of doors, or material openings, but more truly of"
3784,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"beginnings,--especially of good beginnings which insure good endings."
3785,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Hence undoubtedly he is represented as facing both ways; for the Romans
3786,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,very properly believed that beginning and ending were of the same
3787,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"piece, and that an undertaking ill begun could not achieve success."
3788,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"His temple, or covered passage, in the Forum had doors facing east and"
3789,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,west for the beginning and ending of the day; and between stood his
3790,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,two-faced statue. In every home the morning prayer was addressed to
3791,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,him; in every domestic enterprise his assistance was implored. He was
3792,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"the god, also, of the opening year; hence his month, January, on the"
3793,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"first day of which words only of good omen were uttered, and gifts were"
3794,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"given (_strenae_, a name still preserved in the French word for New"
3795,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Year's presents, _étrennes_), and, for good luck, some stroke of work"
3796,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,was bestowed on every undertaking planned for the year. He was publicly
3797,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"invoked not only on New Year's day, but on the first day of each"
3798,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"month, by priests and people alike; and in these prayers his name was"
3799,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"mentioned even before that of Jupiter. He is the god of civilization,"
3800,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"and is sometimes called Consivius, or the Sower.[64] Of course he was"
3801,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,invoked when wars were commenced. And during their progress the doors
3802,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,of his temple stood always open. In peace they were closed; but they
3803,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,were shut only once between the reign of Numa and that of Augustus.
3804,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"It was natural that his worship should gradually absorb that of Sol,"
3805,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"the Sun, who opens the day and completes the year and blesses with his"
3806,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,rays the seeds that are sown; and such was the case. But Janus and his
3807,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"wife Jana were not originally connected even in name with Dianus (Sol,"
3808,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Apollo) and Diana (the moon).
3809,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3810,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"3. _Quirinus_, a war-god, said to be no other than Romulus, the founder"
3811,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the immortals."
3812,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3813,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"4. _Bellona_, a war-goddess."
3814,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3815,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"5. _Lucina_, the goddess who brings to light, hence the goddess of"
3816,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,childbirth: a title bestowed upon both Juno and Diana.
3817,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3818,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"6. _Terminus_, the god of landmarks. His statue was a rude stone or"
3819,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"post, set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields."
3820,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3821,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"7. _Faunus_, the grandson of Saturn. He was worshiped as a god of"
3822,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"fields and shepherds and also of prophecy. His name in the plural,"
3823,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Fauni, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the Satyrs of the"
3824,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Greeks. There was also a goddess called _Fauna_, or _Bona Dea_ (good"
3825,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"goddess). To Maia, wife of Vulcan, this designation, _Bona Dea_, was"
3826,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,sometimes applied.
3827,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3828,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"8. _Sylvanus_, presiding over forest-glades and plowed fields."
3829,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3830,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"9. _Pales_, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures. _Flora_,"
3831,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"the goddess of flowers. _Pomona_, presiding over fruit trees."
3832,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"_Vertumnus_, the husband of Pomona, was guardian of fruit trees,"
3833,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"gardens, and vegetables."
3834,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3835,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Pomona loves the orchard,"
3836,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"And Liber loves the vine,"
3837,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,And Pales loves the straw-built shed
3838,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Warm with the breath of kine;
3839,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,And Venus loves the whisper
3840,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Of plighted youth and maid
3841,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"In April's ivory moonlight,"
3842,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Beneath the chestnut shade.[65]
3843,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3844,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"10. _The Penates_, gods who were supposed to attend to the welfare"
3845,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"and prosperity of the family. Their name is derived from Penus, the"
3846,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"storehouse or inner chamber, which was sacred to them. Every master of"
3847,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,a family was the priest to the Penates of his own house.
3848,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3849,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"The _Lares_, or _Lars_, were also tutelary deities, but they differed"
3850,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,from the Penates since they were regarded as the deified spirits of
3851,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"ancestors, who watched over and protected their descendants. The"
3852,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Lares were more particularly divinities presiding over the household
3853,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"or family; but there were also public Lares, or guardian spirits of"
3854,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"the city, Lares of the precincts, Lares of the fields, Lares of the"
3855,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"highways, and Lares of the sea. To the Penates, to the domestic Lares"
3856,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"(whose images were preserved in a private shrine), and to the _Manes_"
3857,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"(shades that hovered over the place of burial), the family prayers of"
3858,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"the Romans were addressed. Other spirits, the _Lemures_ and _Larvæ_,"
3859,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,more nearly correspond to our ghosts.

3863,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,The Romans believed that every man had his _Genius_ and every woman her
3864,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"_Juno_; that is, a spirit who had given them being and was regarded"
3865,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,as a protector through life. On birthdays men made offerings to their
3866,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Genius, women to their Juno."

3868,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"11. Other Italian deities were the gods of the rivers, such as _Father"
3869,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Tiber_, and the goddesses of the springs and brooks, such as _Juturna_,"
3870,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,whose pool in the Forum was sacred. This nymph was also a goddess of
3871,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"healing and, according to later tradition, was beloved by Jupiter."
3872,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"Earlier stories, however, make her the wife of Janus and the mother of"
3873,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"_Fontus_, the god of flowing waters, who had an altar on the Janiculan"
3874,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"hill and was worshiped at an annual festival called the Fontinalia,"
3875,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,when the wells were wreathed with garlands. Held in especial honor were
3876,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"the _Camenæ_, fountain-nymphs, goddesses of prophecy and healing (later"
3877,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"identified with the Muses). The leader of them was _Carmenta_, who sang"
3878,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,both the future and the past. With her is sometimes associated the
3879,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"nymph _Egeria_, from whom the Roman king Numa is said to have received"
3880,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,instruction concerning the forms of worship which he introduced.
3881,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3882,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"12. The Romans worshiped, also, _Sol_, the Sun; _Luna_, the Moon;"
3883,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"_Mater Matuta_, the Dawn; _Juventus_, Youth; _Fides_, Honesty;"
3884,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"_Feronia_, goddess of groves and freedmen; and a great number of"
3885,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,"personified abstractions of conduct and experience, such as Fortune and"
3886,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Health.
3887,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,
3888,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,Many of these Latin divinities were derived from the earlier cult and
3889,THE ROMAN DIVINITIES,ritual of the Etruscan inhabitants of Italy.

3910,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,turn upon his love affairs. Among the immortals his queen had rivals in
3911,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his affection; for instance, Latona, a goddess of darkness, daughter"
3912,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of the Titans C[oe]us and Ph[oe]be. This goddess became, as we have"
3913,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"already seen, the mother of Apollo and Diana. The ire of Juno against"
3914,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her was never appeased. In consequence of it, numerous trials were"
3915,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"visited upon Latona, some of which find a place among the adventures of"

3921,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,were Jupiter's relations sometimes of a dubious character. His devotion
3922,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,to the beautiful daughters of men involved him in frequent altercations
3923,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"with his justly jealous spouse. Of his fondness for Danaë, whom he"
3924,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"approached in a shower of gold, particulars are given in the story of"
3925,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her son Perseus; of his love for Alcmene, the granddaughter of that"
3926,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Perseus, we are informed in the myths of her son Hercules; and of his"
3927,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"attentions to Leda, whom he wooed in guise of a swan, we learn in the"
3928,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"accounts of their children Pollux and Helen. Other love passages, upon"

3935,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Inachus, son of Oceanus. It is said that Juno one day, perceiving the"
3936,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"skies suddenly overcast, surmised that her husband had raised a cloud"
3937,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,to hide some escapade. She brushed away the darkness and saw him on the
3938,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,banks of a glassy river with a beautiful heifer standing near. Juno
3939,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"suspected, with reason, that the heifer's form concealed some fair"
3940,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"nymph of mortal mold. It was Io, whom Jupiter, when he became aware of"
3941,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the approach of his wife, had changed into that form."

3945,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"The ox-eyed goddess joined her husband, noticed the heifer, praised"
3946,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"its beauty, and asked whose it was and of what herd. Jupiter, to"
3947,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"stop questions, replied that it was a fresh creation from the earth."
3948,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Juno begged it as a gift. What could the king of gods and men do? He
3949,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,was loath to surrender his sweetheart to his wife; yet how refuse
3950,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"so trifling a present as a heifer? He could not, without exciting"
3951,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"suspicion, and he therefore consented. The goddess delivered the heifer"
3952,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to Argus, to be strictly watched."
3953,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
3954,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Now Argus had a hundred eyes in his head, and never went to sleep with"
3955,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"more than two at a time, so that he kept watch of Io constantly. He"
3956,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,suffered her to graze through the day and at night tied a rope round
3957,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,her neck. She would have stretched out her arms to implore freedom of
3958,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Argus, but that she had no arms to stretch out and her voice was a"
3959,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,bellow. She yearned in vain to make herself known to her father. At
3960,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"length she bethought herself of writing, and inscribed her name--it"
3961,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"was a short one--with her hoof on the sand. Inachus recognized it,"
3962,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and, discovering that his daughter whom he had long sought in vain was"
3963,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hidden under this disguise, mourned over her. While he thus lamented,"
3964,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Argus, observing, drove her away and took his seat on a bank from"
3965,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,whence he could see in every direction.

3968,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
3969,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Jupiter, grieved by the sufferings of his mistress, sent Mercury to"
3970,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,dispatch Argus. Mercury took his sleep-producing wand and presented
3971,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"himself on earth as a shepherd driving his flock. As he strolled, he"
3972,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,blew upon his syrinx or Pandean pipes. Argus listened with delight.
3973,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"""Young man,"" said he, ""come and take a seat by me on this stone. There"
3974,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"is no better place for your flock to graze in than hereabouts, and here"
3975,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"is a pleasant shade such as shepherds love."" Mercury sat down, talked,"
3976,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"told stories till it grew late, and played upon his pipes his most"
3977,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"soothing strains, hoping to lull the watchful eyes to sleep, but in"
3978,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"vain; for Argus still contrived to keep some of his eyes open, though"
3979,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,he shut the rest.
3980,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
3981,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"But among other stories, Mercury told him how the instrument on which"
3982,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"he played was invented. ""There was a certain nymph,"" said he, ""whose"
3983,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"name was Syrinx,--much beloved by the satyrs and spirits of the wood."
3984,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"She would have none of them, but was a faithful worshiper of Diana"
3985,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and followed the chase. Pan, meeting her one day, wooed her with many"
3986,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"compliments, likening her to Diana of the silver bow. Without stopping"
3987,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,to hear him she ran away. But on the bank of the river he overtook
3988,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her. She called for help on her friends, the water-nymphs. They heard"
3989,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,and consented. Pan threw his arms around what he supposed to be the
3990,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,form of the nymph and found he embraced only a tuft of reeds. As he
3991,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"breathed a sigh, the air sounded through the reeds and produced a"
3992,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"plaintive melody. Whereupon the god, charmed with the novelty and with"
3993,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the sweetness of the music, said, 'Thus, then, at least, you shall be"
3994,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,mine.' Taking some of the reeds of unequal lengths and placing them
3995,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"together, side by side, he made an instrument and called it Syrinx,"
3996,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in honor of the nymph."" Before Mercury had finished his story he saw"
3997,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the eyes of Argus all asleep. At once he slew him and set Io free. The
3998,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,eyes of Argus Juno took and scattered as ornaments on the tail of her
3999,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"peacock, where they remain to this day."
4000,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4001,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,But the vengeance of Juno was not yet satiated. She sent a gadfly to
4002,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"torment Io, who, in her flight, swam through the sea, named after"
4003,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her, Ionian. Afterward, roaming over many lands, she reached at last"
4004,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the banks of the Nile. Then Jupiter interceded for her; and upon his
4005,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"engaging not to pay her any further attention, Juno consented to"
4006,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,restore her to her form.
4007,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4008,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"In a poem dedicated to Leigh Hunt, by Keats, the following allusion to"
4009,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the story of Pan and Syrinx occurs:

4019,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4020,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,=58. Callisto= of Arcadia was another maiden who excited the jealousy
4021,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of Juno. Her the goddess changed into a bear. Often, frightened by"
4022,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the dogs, Callisto, though lately a huntress, fled in terror from the"
4023,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hunters. Often, too, she fled from the wild beasts, forgetting that"
4024,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"she was now a wild beast herself; and, bear as she was, she feared the"
4025,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,bears.
4026,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4027,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,One day a youth espied her as he was hunting. She saw him and
4028,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"recognized him as her son Arcas, grown to manhood. She stopped and felt"
4029,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"inclined to embrace him. He, alarmed, raised his hunting spear and was"
4030,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"on the point of transfixing her, but Jupiter arrested the crime and,"
4031,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"snatching away both of them, placed them in the heavens as the Great"

4033,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4034,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Juno, enraged at seeing her rival so set in honor, hastened to ancient"
4035,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Tethys and Oceanus and, complaining that she was supplanted in Heaven,"
4036,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"cried, ""So do my punishments result--such is the extent of my power! I"
4037,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"forbade her to wear human form,--she and her hateful son are placed"
4038,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"among the stars. Better that she should have resumed her former shape,"
4039,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,as I permitted Io to do. Perhaps my husband means to take her to
4040,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"wife, and put me away! But you, my foster parents, if you feel for"
4041,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"me, and see with displeasure this unworthy treatment of me, show it,"

4058,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"that other with mighty hands, and forcefully, kept haling the"

4085,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,preëminent among them all like the foam-born goddess among the
4086,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Graces. Verily, she was not for long to set her heart's delight"

4088,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"as he beheld her, was troubled, and his heart was subdued by the"

4121,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"could not reach her. The strand he gained, and forward he sped"
4122,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"like a dolphin, faring with unwetted hooves over the wide waves."
4123,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"And the sea, as he came, grew smooth, and the sea monsters"

4125,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"rejoiced, and rising from the deeps, he tumbled on the swell of"
4126,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the sea. The Nereïds arose out of the salt water, and all of them"
4127,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"came on in orderly array, riding on the backs of sea beasts. And"
4128,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"himself, the thunderous shaker of the world, appeared above the"
4129,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"sea, and made smooth the wave, and guided his brother on the"
4130,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"salt sea path, and round him were gathered the Tritons, these"
4131,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hoarse trumpeters of the deep, blowing from their long conchs a"

4137,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,be wet in the hoar sea's infinite spray. And her deep robe was
4138,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"swelled out by the winds, like the sail of a ship, and lightly"
4139,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,still did waft the maiden onward. But when she was now far off
4140,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"from her own country, and neither sea-beat headland nor steep"
4141,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hill could now be seen, but above, the air, and beneath, the"

4177,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,was daughter to Mars and the laughter-loving Venus. To Semele Jupiter
4178,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"had appeared, and had paid court in unostentatious manner and simple"
4179,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"guise. But Juno, to gratify her resentment against this new rival for"
4180,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her lord's affections, contrived a plan for her destruction. Assuming"
4181,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the form of Beroë, the aged nurse of Semele, she insinuated doubts"
4182,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"whether it was indeed Jove himself who came as a lover. Heaving a sigh,"
4183,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"she said, ""I hope it will turn out so, but I can't help being afraid."
4184,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"People are not always what they pretend to be. If he is indeed Jove,"
4185,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,make him give some proof of it. Ask him to come arrayed in all his

4188,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"without naming what it is. Jove gives his promise, and confirms it"
4189,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"with the irrevocable oath, attesting the river Styx, terrible to the"
4190,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,gods themselves. Then she made known her request. The god would have
4191,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"stopped her as she spake, but she was too quick for him. The words"
4192,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"escaped, and he could neither unsay his promise nor her request. In"
4193,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,deep distress he left her and returned to the upper regions. There he
4194,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"clothed himself in his splendors, not putting on all his terrors, as"
4195,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"when he overthrew the giants, but what is known among the gods as his"

4253,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,indirectly in Jupiter's love affairs might yet be involved in the
4254,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,consequences of them is illustrated by the fortunes of Ægina. This
4255,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"maiden, the daughter of Asopus, a river-god, attracted the attention"
4256,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of Jupiter, who straightway ran off with her. Now, on the one hand,"
4257,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Sisyphus, king of Corinth, having witnessed the intrigue, was"
4258,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,indiscreet enough to disclose it. Forthwith the vengeance of the
4259,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"king of gods and men fell upon him. He was condemned to Hades and,"
4260,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"attempting to escape thence, had resort to a series of deceptions"

4263,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"incurred the displeasure of Juno, who devastated their land with a"
4264,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,plague. The following account of this calamity is placed in the mouth
4265,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of Æacus, king of the island:[74]"
4266,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4267,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"""At the beginning the sky seemed to settle down upon the earth and"
4268,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,thick clouds shut in the heated air. For four months together a deadly
4269,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,south wind prevailed. The disorder affected the wells and springs.
4270,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Thousands of snakes crept over the land and shed their poison in
4271,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the fountains. The force of the disease was first spent on the lower
4272,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"animals,--dogs, cattle, sheep, and birds. The oxen fell in the midst of"
4273,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,their work. The wool dropped from the bleating sheep. The horse groaned
4274,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,at his stall and died an inglorious death. Everything languished;
4275,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"dead bodies lay in the roads, the fields, and the woods; the air was"
4276,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"poisoned by them. Next the disease attacked the country people, and"
4277,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,then the dwellers in the city. At first the cheek was flushed and the
4278,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"breath drawn with difficulty. The tongue grew rough and swelled, and"
4279,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the dry mouth stood open, with its veins enlarged, and gasped for the"
4280,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"air. Men could not bear the heat of their clothes or their beds, but"
4281,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"preferred to lie on the bare ground. Nor could the physicians help, for"
4282,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the disease attacked them also. At last men learned to look upon death
4283,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"as the only deliverer from disease. All restraint laid aside, they"
4284,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"crowded round the wells and fountains, and drank, without quenching"
4285,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"thirst, till they died. On all sides lay my people strewn like"
4286,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"over-ripened apples beneath the tree, or acorns under the storm-shaken"

4288,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Often, while the priest made ready for sacrifice, the victim fell,"
4289,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,struck down by disease without waiting for the blow. At length all

4401,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Philemon. Once on a time Jupiter, in human shape, visited the land of"
4402,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Phrygia, and with him Mercury, without his wings."
4403,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4404,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"They presented themselves as weary travelers at many a door, seeking"
4405,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"rest and shelter, but found all closed; for it was late, and the"
4406,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,inhospitable inhabitants would not rouse themselves to open for their
4407,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"reception. At last a small thatched cottage received them, where"
4408,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Baucis, a pious old dame, and her husband Philemon had grown old"
4409,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"together. Not ashamed of their poverty, they made it endurable by"
4410,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,moderate desires and kind dispositions. When the two guests crossed
4411,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the humble threshold and bowed their heads to pass under the low door,"
4412,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the old man placed a seat, on which Baucis, bustling and attentive,"
4413,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"spread a cloth, and begged them to sit down. Then she raked out the"
4414,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"coals from the ashes, kindled a fire, and prepared some pot-herbs and"
4415,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"bacon for them. A beechen bowl was filled with warm water, that their"
4416,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"guests might wash. While all was doing, they beguiled the time with"
4417,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,conversation.

4419,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,The old woman with trembling hand set the table. One leg was shorter
4420,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"than the rest, but a piece of slate put under restored the level. When"
4421,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,it was steady she rubbed the table down with sweet-smelling herbs.
4422,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Upon it she set some of chaste Minerva's olives, some cornel berries"
4423,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and cheese, with eggs lightly"
4424,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,cooked in the ashes. The meal was served in earthen dishes; and an
4425,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"earthenware pitcher, with wooden cups, stood beside them. When all was"
4426,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"ready the stew, smoking hot, was set on the table. Some wine, not of"
4427,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the oldest, was added, and for dessert, apples and wild honey."

4432,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"recognized their heavenly guests, fell on their knees, and with clasped"
4433,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,hands implored forgiveness for their poor entertainment. There was an
4434,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"old goose, which they kept as the guardian of their humble cottage, and"
4435,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,they bethought them to make this a sacrifice in honor of their guests.
4436,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"But the goose, too nimble for the old folk, with the aid of feet and"
4437,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,wings eluded their pursuit and at last took shelter between the gods

4439,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"""We are gods. This inhospitable village shall pay the penalty of its"

4442,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"The country behind them was speedily sunk in a lake, only their own"
4443,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"house left standing. While they gazed with wonder at the sight, that"
4444,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,old house of theirs was changed. Columns took the place of the corner
4445,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"posts, the thatch grew yellow and appeared a gilded roof, the floors"
4446,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"became marble, the doors were enriched with carving and ornaments of"
4447,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"gold. Then spoke Jupiter in benignant accents: ""Excellent old man,"
4448,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and woman worthy of such a husband, speak, tell us your wishes. What"
4449,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"favor have you to ask of us?"" Philemon took counsel with Baucis a few"
4450,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"moments, then declared to the gods their common wish. ""We ask to be"
4451,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"priests and guardians of this thy temple, and that one and the same"
4452,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hour may take us both from life."" Their prayer was granted. When they"
4453,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"had attained a great age, as they stood one day before the steps of"
4454,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the sacred edifice and were telling the story of the place, Baucis saw"
4455,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Philemon begin to put forth leaves, and Philemon saw Baucis changing in"
4456,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"like manner. While still they exchanged parting words, a leafy crown"
4457,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"grew over their heads. ""Farewell, dear spouse,"" they said together,"
4458,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,and at the same moment the bark closed over their mouths. The Tyanean

4513,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,blessing reserved for mortals is narrated in the beautiful myth of
4514,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Biton and Cleobis. One Cydippe, an ancient priestess of the white-armed"
4515,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"goddess, had desired to behold the famous new statue of Hera at"
4516,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Argos. Her sons testified their affection for their mother by yoking
4517,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"themselves, since no oxen were at hand, to her chariot, and so dragging"
4518,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,her through heat and dust many a weary league till they reached the
4519,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"temple, where stood the gold and ivory masterwork of Polyclitus. With"
4520,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,admiration the devoted priestess and her pious sons were received by
4521,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the populace crowding round the statue. The priest officiating in the
4522,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,solemn rites thought meet that so reverend a worshiper should herself
4523,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"approach the goddess,--ay, should ask of Hera some blessing on her"
4524,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,faithful sons:
4525,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,

4550,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the useful and ornamental arts, both those of men--such as agriculture"
4551,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and navigation--and those of women--spinning, weaving, and needlework."
4552,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"She was also a warlike divinity, but favored only defensive warfare."
4553,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"With Mars' savage love of violence and bloodshed she, therefore, had"
4554,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"no sympathy. Athens, her chosen seat, her own city, was awarded to"
4555,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her as the prize of a peaceful contest with Neptune, who also aspired"
4556,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to it. In the reign of Cecrops, the first king of Athens, the two"
4557,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,deities had contended for the possession of the city. The gods decreed
4558,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,that it should be awarded to the one who produced the gift most useful
4559,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,to mortals. Neptune gave the horse; Minerva produced the olive. The
4560,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"gods awarded the city to the goddess, and after her Greek appellation,"
4561,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Athena, it was named."
4562,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4563,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"=66. Arachne.= In another contest, a mortal dared to come into"
4564,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"competition with the gray-eyed daughter of Jove. This was Arachne, a"
4565,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"maiden who had attained such skill in the arts of carding and spinning,"
4566,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of weaving and embroidery, that the Nymphs themselves would leave"
4567,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,their groves and fountains to come and gaze upon her work. It was not
4568,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"only beautiful when it was done, but beautiful also in the doing. To"
4569,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,watch her one would have said that Minerva herself had taught her. But
4570,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"this she denied, and could not bear to be thought a pupil even of a"
4571,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"goddess. ""Let Minerva try her skill with mine,"" said she. ""If beaten, I"
4572,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"will pay the penalty."" Minerva heard this and was displeased. Assuming"
4573,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the form of an old woman, she appeared to Arachne and kindly advised"
4574,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her to challenge her fellow mortals if she would, but at once to ask"
4575,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,forgiveness of the goddess. Arachne bade the old dame to keep her
4576,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"counsel for others. ""I am not afraid of the goddess; let her try her"
4577,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"skill, if she dare venture."" ""She comes,"" said Minerva, and dropping"
4578,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her disguise, stood confessed. The Nymphs bent low in homage and all"
4579,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the bystanders paid reverence. Arachne alone was unterrified. A sudden
4580,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"color dyed her cheek, and then she grew pale; but she stood to her"
4581,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,resolve and rushed on her fate. They proceed to the contest. Each
4582,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,takes her station and attaches the web to the beam. Then the slender
4583,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,shuttle is passed in and out among the threads. The reed with its fine
4584,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,teeth strikes up the woof into its place and compacts the web. Wool of
4585,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Tyrian dye is contrasted with that of other colors, shaded off into one"
4586,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,another so adroitly that the joining deceives the eye. And the effect
4587,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"is like the bow whose long arch tinges the heavens, formed by sunbeams"
4588,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"reflected from the shower,[80] in which, where the colors meet they"
4589,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"seem as one, but at a little distance from the point of contact are"

4591,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4592,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Minerva wove the scene of her contest with Neptune (Poseidon). Twelve
4593,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of the heavenly powers were represented, Jupiter, with august gravity,"
4594,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"sitting in the midst. Neptune, the ruler of the sea, held his trident"
4595,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and appeared to have just smitten the earth, from which a horse had"
4596,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,leaped forth. The bright-eyed goddess depicted herself with helmed
4597,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"head, her ægis covering her breast, as when she had created the olive"
4598,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,tree with its berries and its dark green leaves.

4612,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"And masterèd with workmanship so rare,"
4613,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"She stood astonished long, ne aught gainsaid;"
4614,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,And with fast-fixèd eyes on her did stare.[81]
4615,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4616,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,So wonderful was the central circle of Minerva's web; and in the four
4617,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,corners were represented incidents illustrating the displeasure of the
4618,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,gods at such presumptuous mortals as had dared to contend with them.
4619,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,These were meant as warnings from Minerva to her rival to give up the
4620,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,contest before it was too late.
4621,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4622,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,But Arachne did not yield. She filled her web with subjects designedly
4623,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,chosen to exhibit the failings and errors of the gods. One scene
4624,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"represented Leda caressing the swan; and another, Danaë and the golden"
4625,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,shower. Still another depicted Europa deceived by Jupiter under
4626,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the disguise of a bull. Its appearance was that of a real bull, so"
4627,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,naturally was it wrought and so natural the water in which it swam.
4628,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4629,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"With such subjects Arachne filled her canvas, wonderfully well done"
4630,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,but strongly marking her presumption and impiety. Minerva could not
4631,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"forbear to admire, yet was indignant at the insult. She struck the web"
4632,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"with her shuttle and rent it in pieces; then, touching the forehead"
4633,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of Arachne, she made her realize her guilt. It was more than mortal"
4634,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"could bear; and forthwith Arachne hanged herself. ""Live, guilty woman,"""
4635,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"said Minerva, ""but that thou mayest preserve the memory of this"
4636,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"lesson continue to hang, both thou and thy descendants, to all future"
4637,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"times."" Then, sprinkling her with the juices of aconite, the goddess"
4638,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"transformed her into a spider, forever spinning the thread by which she"

4642,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"illustrated by passages from the Iliad, which, generally speaking,"
4643,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,presents him in no very favorable light.
4644,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4645,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"=68. Mars and Diomede.= In the war of the Greeks and the Trojans,[83]"
4646,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the cause of the former was espoused by Minerva, of the latter by Mars."
4647,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Among the chieftains of the Greeks in a certain battle, Diomede, son of"
4648,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Tydeus, was prominent. Now when Mars, scourge of mortals, beheld noble"
4649,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Diomede, he made straight at him."
4650,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4651,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"... And when they were come nigh in onset on one another, first"
4652,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Mars thrust over the yoke and horses' reins with spear of bronze,"
4653,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,eager to take away his life. But the bright-eyed goddess Minerva
4654,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"with her hand seized the spear and thrust it up over the car, to"
4655,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,spend itself in vain. Next Diomede of the loud war cry attacked
4656,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,with spear of bronze; and Minerva drave it home against Mars'
4657,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"nethermost belly, where his taslets were girt about him. There"
4658,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"smote he him and wounded him, rending through his fair skin,--and"
4659,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,plucked forth the spear again. Then brazen Mars bellowed loud as
4660,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle as they join
4661,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,in strife and fray. Thereat trembling gat hold of Achæans and
4662,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Trojans for fear, so mightily bellowed Mars insatiate of battle."

4665,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4666,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Even as gloomy mist appeareth from the clouds when after heat a
4667,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"stormy wind ariseth, even so to Tydeus' son Diomede brazen Mars"
4668,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"appeared amid clouds, faring to wide Heaven. Swiftly came he to"
4669,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the gods' dwelling, steep Olympus, and sat beside Jupiter, son"
4670,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of Cronus, with grief at heart, and showed the immortal blood"
4671,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"flowing from the wound, and piteously spake to him winged words:"
4672,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"""Father Jupiter, hast thou no indignation to behold these violent"
4673,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"deeds? For ever cruelly suffer we gods by one another's devices,"
4674,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in showing men grace. With thee are we all at variance, because"
4675,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"thou didst beget that reckless maiden and baleful, whose thought"
4676,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,is ever of iniquitous deeds. For all the other gods that are
4677,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in Olympus hearken to thee, and we are subject every one; only"
4678,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her thou chaste-nest not, neither in deed nor word, but settest"
4679,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her on, because this pestilent one is thine own offspring. Now"
4680,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hath she urged on Tydeus' son, even overweening Diomede, to rage"
4681,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,furiously against the immortal gods. The Cyprian first he wounded
4682,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in close fight, in the wrist of her hand, and then assailed he"
4683,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"me, even me, with the might of a god. Howbeit my swift feet bare"
4684,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,me away; else had I long endured anguish there amid the grisly
4685,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"heaps of dead, or else had lived strengthless from the smitings"
4686,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of the spear."""
4687,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4688,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Then Jupiter the cloud-gatherer looked sternly at him, and said:"
4689,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"""Nay, thou renegade, sit not by me and whine. Most hateful to"
4690,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,me art thou of all gods that dwell in Olympus; thou ever lovest
4691,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,strife and wars and battles. Truly thy mother's spirit is
4692,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"intolerable, unyielding, even Juno's; her can I scarce rule with"
4693,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,words. Therefore I deem that by her prompting thou art in this
4694,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,plight. Yet will I no longer endure to see thee in anguish; mine
4695,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"offspring art thou, and to me thy mother bare thee. But wert thou"
4696,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"born of any other god unto this violence, long ere this hadst"
4697,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"thou been lower than the sons of Heaven."""
4698,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4699,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,So spake he and bade Pæan heal him. And Pæan laid assuaging
4700,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"drugs upon the wound, and healed him, seeing he was in no wise"
4701,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,of mortal mold. Even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white
4702,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"milk, that is liquid but curdleth speedily as a man stirreth,"
4703,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,even so swiftly healed he impetuous Mars. And Hebe bathed him and
4704,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"clothed him in gracious raiment, and he sate down by Jupiter, son"
4705,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of Cronus, glorying in his might."
4706,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4707,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Then fared the twain back to the mansion of great Jupiter, even"
4708,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Juno and Minerva, having stayed Mars, scourge of mortals, from"
4709,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,his man-slaying.[84]
4710,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4711,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,=69. Mars and Minerva.= It would seem that the insatiate son of Juno
4712,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,should have learned by this sad experience to avoid measuring arms with
4713,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the ægis-bearing Minerva. But he renewed the contest at a later period
4714,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,in the fortunes of the Trojan War:
4715,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4716,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"... Jupiter knew what was coming as he sat upon Olympus, and his"
4717,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,heart within him laughed pleasantly when he beheld that strife
4718,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of gods. Then no longer stood they asunder, for Mars, piercer of"
4719,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"shields, began the battle and first made for Minerva with his"
4720,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"bronze spear, and spake a taunting word: ""Wherefore, O dogfly,"
4721,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"dost thou match gods with gods in strife, with stormy daring,"
4722,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,as thy great spirit moveth thee? Rememberest thou not how thou
4723,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"movedst Diomede, Tydeus' son, to wound me, and thyself didst take"
4724,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,a visible spear and thrust it straight at me and pierce through
4725,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,my fair skin? Therefore deem I now that thou shalt pay me for all
4726,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"that thou hast done."""
4727,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4728,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Thus saying, he smote on the dread tasseled ægis that not"
4729,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,even the lightning of Jupiter can overcome--thereon smote
4730,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"blood-stained Mars with his long spear. But she, giving back,"
4731,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"grasped with stout hand a stone that lay upon the plain, black,"
4732,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"rugged, huge, which men of old time set to be the landmark of a"
4733,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"field; this hurled she, and smote impetuous Mars on the neck,"
4734,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and unstrung his limbs. Seven roods he covered in his fall, and"
4735,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"soiled his hair with dust, and his armor rang upon him. And"
4736,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Minerva laughed, and spake to him winged words exultingly: ""Fool,"
4737,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,not even yet hast thou learnt how far better than thou I claim to
4738,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"be, that thus thou matchest thy might with mine. Thus shalt thou"
4739,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"satisfy thy mother's curses, who deviseth mischief against thee"
4740,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in her wrath, for that thou hast left the Achæans and givest the"
4741,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"proud Trojans aid."""
4742,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4743,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Thus having said, she turned from him her shining eyes. Him did"
4744,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Venus, daughter of Jupiter, take by the hand and lead away,"
4745,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"groaning continually, for scarce gathered he his spirit back to"
4746,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,him.[85]
4747,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4748,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"=70. The Fortunes of Cadmus.= Toward mortals Mars could show himself,"
4749,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"on occasion, as vindictive as his fair foe, the unwearied daughter of"
4750,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Jove. This fact not only Cadmus, who slew a serpent sacred to Mars, but"
4751,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,all the family of Cadmus found out to their cost.
4752,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4753,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,[Illustration: FIG. 54. CADMUS SLAYING THE DRAGON]
4754,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4755,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"When Europa was carried away by Jupiter in the guise of a bull, her"
4756,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,father Agenor commanded his son Cadmus to go in search of her and not
4757,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to return without her. Cadmus sought long and far; then, not daring"
4758,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to return unsuccessful, consulted the oracle of Apollo to know what"
4759,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,country he should settle in. The oracle informed him that he would find
4760,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"a cow in the field, should follow her wherever she might wander, and"
4761,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,where she stopped should build a city and call it Thebes. Cadmus had
4762,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hardly left the Castalian cave, from which the oracle was delivered,"
4763,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,when he saw a young cow slowly walking before him. He followed her
4764,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"close, offering at the same time his prayers to Ph[oe]bus. The cow"
4765,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,went on till she passed the shallow channel of Cephissus and came
4766,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,out into the plain of Panope. There she stood still. Cadmus gave
4767,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"thanks, and stooping down kissed the foreign soil, then lifting his"
4768,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"eyes, greeted the surrounding mountains. Wishing to offer a sacrifice"
4769,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to his protecting deity, Minerva, he sent his servants to seek pure"
4770,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,water for a libation. Near by there stood an ancient grove which had
4771,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"never been profaned by the ax, in the midst of which was a cave thick"
4772,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"covered with the growth of bushes, its roof forming a low arch from"
4773,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,beneath which burst forth a fountain of purest water. But in the cave
4774,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"lurked a serpent with crested head, and scales glittering like gold;"
4775,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,his eyes shone like fire; his body was swollen with venom; he vibrated
4776,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,a triple tongue and showed a triple row of teeth. No sooner had the
4777,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Tyrians dipped their pitchers in the fountain and the in-gushing waters
4778,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"had made a sound, than the monster, twisting his scaly body in a huge"
4779,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"coil, darted upon them and destroyed some with his fangs, others in his"
4780,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"folds, and others with his poisonous breath."
4781,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4782,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Cadmus, having waited for the return of his men till midday, went in"
4783,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,search of them. When he entered the wood and saw their lifeless bodies
4784,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and the dragon with his bloody jaws, not knowing that the serpent was"
4785,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"sacred to Mars, scourge of mortals, he lifted a huge stone and threw"
4786,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,it with all his force at the monster. The blow made no impression.
4787,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Minerva, however, was present, unseen, to aid her worshiper. Cadmus"
4788,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"next threw his javelin, which penetrated the serpent's scales and"
4789,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,pierced through to his entrails. The monster attempted to draw out
4790,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the weapon with his mouth, but broke it off, leaving the iron point"
4791,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"rankling in his flesh. His neck swelled with rage, bloody foam covered"
4792,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his jaws, and the breath of his nostrils poisoned the air around. As he"
4793,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"moved onward, Cadmus retreated before him, holding his spear opposite"
4794,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to the serpent's opened jaws. At last, watching his chance, the hero"
4795,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,thrust the spear at a moment when the animal's head thrown back came
4796,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"against the trunk of a tree, and so succeeded in pinning him to its"
4797,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,side.
4798,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4799,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"While Cadmus stood over his conquered foe, contemplating its vast size,"
4800,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"a voice was heard (from whence he knew not, but it was Minerva's)"
4801,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,commanding him to take the dragon's teeth and sow them in the earth.
4802,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Scarce had he done so when the clods began to move and the points of
4803,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"spears to appear above the surface. Next, helmets with their nodding"
4804,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"plumes came up; next, the shoulders and breasts and limbs of men with"
4805,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"weapons, and in time a harvest of armed warriors. Cadmus prepared to"
4806,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"encounter a new enemy, but one of them said to him, ""Meddle not with"
4807,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"our civil war."" With that he who had spoken smote one of his earthborn"
4808,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"brothers with a sword, and he himself fell pierced with an arrow from"
4809,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"another. The latter fell victim to a fourth, and in like manner the"
4810,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,whole crowd dealt with each other till all but five fell slain. These
4811,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"five joined with Cadmus in building his city, to which they gave the"
4812,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,name appointed.

4815,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4816,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"As penance for the destruction of this sacred serpent, Cadmus served"
4817,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Mars for a period of eight years. After he had been absolved of his
4818,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"impiety, Minerva set him over the realm of Thebes, and Jove gave him to"
4819,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"wife Harmonia, the daughter of Venus and Mars. The gods left Olympus to"
4820,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,honor the occasion with their presence; and Vulcan presented the bride
4821,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"with a necklace of surpassing brilliancy, his own workmanship. Of this"
4822,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"marriage were born four daughters, Semele, Ino, Autonoë, and Agave,"
4823,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and one son, Polydorus. But in spite of the atonement made by Cadmus,"
4824,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,a fatality hung over the family. The very necklace of Vulcan seemed to
4825,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,catch the spirit of ill luck and convey a baleful influence to such
4826,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"as wore it. Semele, Ino, Actæon the son of Autonoë, and Pentheus the"
4827,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"son of Agave, all perished by violence. Cadmus and Harmonia quitted"
4828,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Thebes, grown odious to them, and emigrated to the country of the"
4829,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Enchelians, who received them with honor and made Cadmus their king."
4830,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"But the misfortunes of their children still weighing upon their minds,"
4831,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Cadmus one day exclaimed, ""If a serpent's life is so dear to the gods,"
4832,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"I would I were myself a serpent."" No sooner had he uttered the words"
4833,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"than he began to change his form. Harmonia, beholding it, prayed the"
4834,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"gods to let her share his fate. Both became serpents. It is said that,"
4835,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"mindful of their origin, they neither avoid the presence of man nor"
4836,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,do they injure any one. But the curse appears not to have passed from
4837,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,their house until the sons of their great-great-grandson [OE]dipus had
4838,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,by fraternal strife ended themselves and the family.[86]

4845,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,incidents illustrating his character are sufficiently numerous.
4846,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"According to an account already given, Vulcan, because of his lameness,"
4847,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,was cast out of Heaven by his mother Juno. The sea-goddesses Eurynome
4848,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and Thetis took him mercifully to themselves, and for nine years cared"
4849,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"for him, while he plied his trade and gained proficiency in it. In"
4850,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,order to revenge himself upon the mother who had so despitefully used
4851,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"him, he fashioned in the depths of the sea a throne of cunning device,"
4852,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"which he sent to his mother. She, gladly accepting the glorious gift,"
4853,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"sat down upon it, to find out that straightway all manner of invisible"
4854,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,chains and fetters wound and clasped themselves about her so that she
4855,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,could not rise. The assistance of the gods was of no avail to release
4856,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,her. Then Mars sought to bring Vulcan to Heaven by force that he might
4857,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"undo his trickery; but before the flames of the fire-god, the impetuous"
4858,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"warrior speedily retreated. One god, however, the jovial Bacchus, was"
4859,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"dear to the blacksmith. He drenched Vulcan with wine, conducted him to"
4860,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Olympus, and by persuasion caused him to set the queen of gods and men"
4861,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,at liberty.

4864,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4865,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,That Vulcan was not permanently hostile to Juno is shown by the
4866,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,services that on various occasions he rendered her. He forged the
4867,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"shield of her favorite Achilles; and, at her instance, he undertook a"
4868,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,contest against the river Xanthus. Homer[87] describes the burning of
4869,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"elms and willow trees and tamarisks, the parching of the plains, the"
4870,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"bubbling of the waters, that signalized the fight, and how the eels and"

4875,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Ph[oe]bus Apollo illustrate, first, his birth and the wanderings"
4876,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of his mother, Latona; secondly, his victory over darkness and"
4877,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"winter; thirdly, his gifts to man,--youth and vigor, the sunshine of"
4878,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"spring, and the vegetation of early summer; fourthly, his baleful"
4879,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"influence,--the sunstroke and drought of midsummer, the miasma of"
4880,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"autumn; fifthly, his life on earth, as friend and counselor of"
4881,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"mankind,--healer, soothsayer, and musician, prototype of manly beauty,"
4882,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,and lover of beautiful women.

4885,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"white-armed Juno, Latona fled from land to land. At last, bearing in"
4886,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her arms the infant progeny of Jove, she reached Lycia, weary with her"
4887,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,burden and parched with thirst. There the following adventure ensued.
4888,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,By chance the persecuted goddess espied in the bottom of the valley a
4889,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"pond of clear water, where the country people were at work gathering"

4891,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"slaked her thirst in the cool stream, but the rustics forbade her. ""Why"
4892,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"do you refuse me water?"" said she. ""Water is free to all. Yet I ask"
4893,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"it of you as a favor. I have no intention of washing my limbs in it,"
4894,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"weary though they be, but only of quenching my thirst. A draft of water"
4895,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"would be nectar to me, and I would own myself indebted to you for life"
4896,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"itself. Let these infants move your pity, who stretch out their little"
4897,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"arms as if to plead for me."""

4899,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"But the clowns persisted in their rudeness; they added jeers, and"
4900,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,threatened violence if she did not leave the place. They waded into the
4901,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"pond and stirred up the mud with their feet, so as to make the water"
4902,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"unfit to drink. Enraged, the goddess no longer supplicated the clowns,"
4903,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"but lifting her hands to Heaven exclaimed, ""May they never quit that"
4904,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"pool but pass their lives there!"" And it came to pass accordingly. They"
4905,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"still live in the water, sometimes totally submerged, then raising"
4906,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,their heads above the surface or swimming upon it; sometimes coming
4907,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"out upon the bank, but soon leaping back again into the water. Their"
4908,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"voices are harsh, their throats bloated, their mouths distended by"
4909,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"constant railing; their necks have shrunk up and disappeared, and"
4910,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"their heads are joined to their bodies. Their backs are green, their"
4911,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,disproportioned bellies white. They dwell as frogs in the slimy

4915,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"spent a year among the Hyperboreans, whose shining land has been"
4916,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"already described.[89] On his return, slaying with his golden arrows"
4917,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the Python that had infested the slopes near Delphi, he sang for the"
4918,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"first time that song of victory which, as _the Pæan_, is still among"
4919,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"all nations synonymous with jubilation, praise, and thanksgiving. In"
4920,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his conflict with another monster of darkness and winter, the god"
4921,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,of the silver bow had the assistance of his sister Diana. By their
4922,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"unerring fiery darts they subdued the giant Tityus, who not only"
4923,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"had obstructed the peaceful ways to the oracle of Delphi, but had"
4924,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,ventured to insult the mother of the twin deities. They overthrew
4925,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"also the Aloadæ, Otus and Ephialtes, sons of Iphimedia and Neptune."
4926,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"These monsters, the reputed sons of Aloeus, represent, perhaps,"
4927,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the unregulated forces of vegetation; they were renowned for their
4928,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"strength, stature, and courage. They grew at the rate of three cubits"
4929,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in height and one in breadth every year; and, when nine years of age,"
4930,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"they attempted, by piling Mount Ossa upon Olympus, and Mount Pelion on"
4931,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"top, to scale the skies and dethrone the immortals. It is reported that"
4932,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"not Apollo and Diana, but Jupiter himself with his lightning slew them."
4933,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"They atoned for their presumption in Hades, where, bound by serpents"
4934,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to a pillar, they were tormented by the perpetual hooting of a screech"

4939,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,=75. Hyacinthus.= The fiery force of the Far-darter was not felt by
4940,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the monsters of darkness alone. His friendship for the young and the
4941,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,vigorous was frequently as dangerous as it was dear to the objects
4942,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of it. He was, for instance, passionately fond of a youth named"
4943,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Hyacinthus. The god of the silver bow accompanied the lad in his
4944,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"sports, carried the nets when he went fishing, led the dogs when he"
4945,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"went to hunt, followed him in his excursions in the mountains, and"
4946,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,neglected for him both lyre and arrows. One day they played a game of
4947,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"quoits; Apollo, heaving aloft the discus with strength mingled with"
4948,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"skill, sent it high and far. Hyacinthus, excited with the sport and"
4949,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"eager to make his throw, ran forward to seize the missile; but it"
4950,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,bounded from the earth and struck him in the forehead. He fainted and
4951,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"fell. The god, as pale as himself, raised him and tried all his art to"
4952,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"stanch the wound and retain the flitting life, but in vain. As when"
4953,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,one has broken the stem of a lily in the garden it hangs its head and
4954,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"turns its flowers to the earth, so the head of the dying boy, as if too"
4955,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"heavy for his neck, fell over on his shoulder. ""Thou diest, Hyacinth,"""
4956,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"spake Ph[oe]bus, ""robbed of thy youth by me. Would that I could die"
4957,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"for thee! But since that may not be, my lyre shall celebrate thee, my"
4958,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"song shall tell thy fate, and thou shalt become a flower inscribed with"
4959,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"my regret."" While the golden god spoke, the blood which had flowed on"
4960,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the ground and stained the herbage ceased to be blood; and a flower of
4961,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"hue more beautiful than the Tyrian sprang up, resembling the lily, save"
4962,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"that this is purple and that silvery white. Ph[oe]bus then, to confer"
4963,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"still greater honor, marked the petals with his sorrow, inscribing"
4964,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"""Ai! ai!"" upon them. The flower bears the name of Hyacinthus, and with"
4965,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,returning spring revives the memory of his fate.[91]
4966,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4967,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"It was said that Zephyrus (the west wind), who was also fond of"
4968,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of Apollo, blew the quoit out"
4969,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,of its course to make it strike Hyacinthus.
4970,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4971,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"While this youth met his death by accident, another of Apollo's"
4972,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"favorites, his own son, brought death upon himself by presumption. The"
4973,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,story is as follows:
4974,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
4975,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,=76. Phaëthon=[2] was the son of Apollo and the nymph Clymene. One
4976,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"day Epaphus, the son of Jupiter and Io,[92] scoffed at the idea of"
4977,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Phaëthon's being the son of a god. Phaëthon complained of the insult
4978,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,to his mother Clymene. She sent him to Ph[oe]bus to ask for himself
4979,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,whether he had not been truly informed concerning his parentage.
4980,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Gladly Phaëthon traveled toward the regions of sunrise and gained at
4981,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"last the palace of the Sun. He approached his father's presence, but"
4982,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"stopped at a distance, for the light was more than he could bear."
4983,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Ph[oe]bus Apollo, arrayed in purple, sat on a throne that glittered"
4984,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"with diamonds. Beside him stood the Day, the Month, the Year, the"
4985,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Hours, and the Seasons. Surrounded by these attendants, the Sun beheld"
4986,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the youth dazzled with the novelty and splendor of the scene, and"
4987,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"inquired the purpose of his errand. The youth replied, ""Oh, light of"
4988,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the boundless world, Ph[oe]bus, my father--if thou dost yield me that"
4989,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"name--give me some proof, I beseech thee, by which I may be known as"
4990,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"thine!"" He ceased. His father, laying aside the beams that shone around"
4991,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his head, bade him approach, embraced him, owned him for his son, and"
4992,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,swore by the river Styx[93] that whatever proof he might ask should
4993,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,be granted. Phaëthon immediately asked to be permitted for one day to
4994,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,drive the chariot of the sun. The father repented of his promise and
4995,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,tried to dissuade the boy by telling him the perils of the undertaking.
4996,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"""None but myself,"" he said, ""may drive the flaming car of day. Not"
4997,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"even Jupiter, whose terrible right arm hurls the thunderbolts. The"
4998,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,first part of the way is steep and such as the horses when fresh in
4999,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the morning can hardly climb; the middle is high up in the heavens,"
5000,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"whence I myself can scarcely, without alarm, look down and behold the"
5001,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,earth and sea stretched beneath me. The last part of the road descends
5002,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"rapidly and requires most careful driving. Tethys, who is waiting to"
5003,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"receive me, often trembles for me lest I should fall headlong. Add to"
5004,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,this that the heaven is all the time turning round and carrying the
5005,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,stars with it. Couldst thou keep thy course while the sphere revolved
5006,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"beneath thee? The road, also, is through the midst of frightful"
5007,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"monsters. Thou must pass by the horns of the Bull, in front of the"
5008,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Archer, and near the Lion's jaws, and where the Scorpion stretches its"
5009,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,arms in one direction and the Crab in another. Nor wilt thou find it
5010,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"easy to guide those horses, with their breasts full of fire that they"
5011,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"breathe forth from their mouths and nostrils. Beware, my son, lest I be"
5012,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the donor of a fatal gift; recall the request while yet thou canst."" He"
5013,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"ended; but the youth rejected admonition and held to his demand. So,"
5014,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"having resisted as long as he might, Ph[oe]bus at last led the way to"
5015,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,where stood the lofty chariot.
5016,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5017,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan,--the axle of gold, the pole and"
5018,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"wheels of gold, the spokes of silver. Along the seat were rows of"
5019,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"chrysolites and diamonds, reflecting the brightness of the sun. While"
5020,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the daring youth gazed in admiration, the early Dawn threw open the"
5021,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,purple doors of the east and showed the pathway strewn with roses. The
5022,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"stars withdrew, marshaled by the Daystar, which last of all retired"
5023,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"also. The father, when he saw the earth beginning to glow and the Moon"
5024,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"preparing to retire, ordered the Hours to harness up the horses. They"
5025,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"led forth from the lofty stalls the steeds full fed with ambrosia, and"
5026,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"attached the reins. Then the father, smearing the face of his son with"
5027,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"a powerful unguent, made him capable of enduring the brightness of the"
5028,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"flame. He set the rays on the lad's head, and, with a foreboding sigh,"
5029,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,told him to spare the whip and hold tight the reins; not to take the
5030,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"straight road between the five circles, but to turn off to the left;"
5031,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,to keep within the limit of the middle zone and avoid the northern and
5032,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the southern alike; finally, to keep in the well-worn ruts and to drive"
5033,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"neither too high nor too low, for the middle course was safest and"
5034,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,best.[94]
5035,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5036,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Forthwith the agile youth sprang into the chariot, stood erect, and"
5037,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"grasped the reins with delight, pouring out thanks to his reluctant"
5038,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,parent. But the steeds soon perceived that the load they drew was
5039,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,lighter than usual; and as a ship without ballast is tossed hither
5040,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and thither on the sea, the chariot, without its accustomed weight,"
5041,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,was dashed about as if empty. The horses rushed headlong and left the
5042,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"traveled road. Then, for the first time, the Great and Little Bears"
5043,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"were scorched with heat, and would fain, if it were possible, have"
5044,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,plunged into the water; and the Serpent which lies coiled round the
5045,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"north pole, torpid and harmless, grew warm, and with warmth felt its"
5046,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"rage revive. Boötes, they say, fled away, though encumbered with his"
5047,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,plow and unused to rapid motion.
5048,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5049,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"When hapless Phaëthon looked down upon the earth, now spreading in vast"
5050,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"extent beneath him, he grew pale, and his knees shook with terror. He"
5051,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,lost his self-command and knew not whether to draw tight the reins
5052,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,or throw them loose; he forgot the names of the horses. But when he
5053,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"beheld the monstrous forms scattered over the surface of heaven,--the"
5054,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Scorpion extending two great arms, his tail, and his crooked claws"
5055,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"over the space of two signs of the zodiac,--when the boy beheld him,"
5056,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"reeking with poison and menacing with fangs, his courage failed, and"
5057,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the reins fell from his hands. The horses, unrestrained, went off into"
5058,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"unknown regions of the sky in among the stars, hurling the chariot"
5059,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"over pathless places, now up in high heaven, now down almost to the"
5060,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,earth. The moon saw with astonishment her brother's chariot running
5061,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,beneath her own. The clouds began to smoke. The forest-clad mountains
5062,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"burned,--Athos and Taurus and Tmolus and [OE]te; Ida, once celebrated"
5063,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"for fountains; the Muses' mountain Helicon, and Hæmus; Ætna, with fires"
5064,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"within and without, and Parnassus, with his two peaks, and Rhodope,"
5065,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,forced at last to part with his snowy crown. Her cold climate was no
5066,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"protection to Scythia; Caucasus burned, and Ossa and Pindus, and,"
5067,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"greater than both, Olympus,--the Alps high in air, and the Apennines"
5068,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,crowned with clouds.

5071,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5072,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Phaëthon beheld the world on fire and felt the heat intolerable.
5073,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Then, too, it is said, the people of Æthiopia became black because"
5074,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the blood was called by the heat so suddenly to the surface; and the
5075,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Libyan desert was dried up to the condition in which it remains to this
5076,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"day. The Nymphs of the fountains, with disheveled hair, mourned their"
5077,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"waters, nor were the rivers safe beneath their banks; Tanaïs smoked,"
5078,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and Caïcus, Xanthus, and Mæander; Babylonian Euphrates and Ganges,"
5079,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Tagus, with golden sands, and Ca[:y]ster, where the swans resort. Nile"
5080,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"fled away and hid his head in the desert, and there it still remains"
5081,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,concealed. Where he used to discharge his waters through seven mouths
5082,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"into the sea, seven dry channels alone remained. The earth cracked"
5083,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"open, and through the chinks light broke into Tartarus and frightened"
5084,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the king of shadows and his queen. The sea shrank up. Even Nereus and
5085,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his wife Doris with the Nereïds, their daughters, sought the deepest"
5086,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,caves for refuge. Thrice Neptune essayed to raise his head above the
5087,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"surface and thrice was driven back by the heat. Earth, surrounded as"
5088,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"she was by waters, yet with head and shoulders bare, screening her"
5089,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"face with her hand, looked up to heaven, and with husky voice prayed"
5090,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Jupiter, if it were his will that she should perish by fire, to end her"
5091,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"agony at once by his thunderbolts, or else to consider his own Heaven,"
5092,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"how both the poles were smoking that sustained his palace, and that all"

5094,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5095,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Earth, overcome with heat and thirst, could say no more. Then Jupiter,"
5096,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,calling the gods to witness that all was lost unless some speedy remedy
5097,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"were applied, thundered, brandished a lightning bolt in his right hand,"
5098,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"launched it against the charioteer, and struck him at the same moment"
5099,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"from his seat and from existence. Phaëthon, with his hair on fire,"
5100,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"fell headlong, like a shooting star which marks the heavens with its"
5101,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"brightness as it falls, and Eridanus, the great river, received him and"
5102,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"cooled his burning frame. His sisters, the Heliades, as they lamented"
5103,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his fate, were turned into poplar trees on the banks of the river; and"
5104,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"their tears, which continued to flow, became amber as they dropped into"
5105,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the stream. The Italian Naiads reared a tomb for him and inscribed

5114,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"only by accident, or by the ill-advised action of those whom he loved,"
5115,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,that Apollo's gifts of light and heat were turned into misfortunes.
5116,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Mortals who offended him were leveled by the cruel sunstroke, by arrows"

5122,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the aged Chryses went apart and prayed aloud, ""Hear me, god of the"

5124,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,

5128,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his shoulders in his wrath, as the god moved; and he descended"
5129,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"like to night. Then he sate him aloof from the ships, and let an"
5130,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,arrow fly; and there was heard a dread clanging of the silver
5131,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"bow. First did he assail the mules and fleet dogs, but afterward,"

5138,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"awful vengeance of Apollo, and also of his sister Diana. This Niobe"
5139,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"was the daughter of a certain Tantalus, king of Phrygia, who had been"
5140,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,received at the table of the gods by his father Jupiter. But there was
5141,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,a strain of ingratitude and conceit in both father and daughter. The
5142,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"father not only betrayed the secrets of the gods, but, to ridicule"
5143,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"their reputed omniscience, attempted at a banquet to deceive them into"
5144,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,eating the roasted flesh of his own son Pelops. The gods were not
5145,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"deceived. Pelops was restored to life,--Tantalus consigned to Tartarus."

5147,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"son Amphion, and her seven stalwart sons and seven blooming daughters,"
5148,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"to the favor of the gods and of Latona in particular, boasted of her"
5149,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"birth, her marriage, and her offspring, bragged of her superiority to"
5150,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Latona, and, on one occasion, scoffed at the annual celebration in"
5151,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,honor of the goddess and her two children. Surveying the people of
5152,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Thebes with haughty glance, she said, ""What folly to prefer beings"
5153,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,whom you have never seen to those who stand before your eyes! Will you
5154,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"prefer to me this Latona, the Titan's daughter, with her two children?"
5155,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"I have seven times as many. Were I to lose some of my children, I"
5156,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,should hardly be left as poor as Latona with her two only. Put off the

5164,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,of you both and have been used to hold myself second to none of the

5167,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"protect me."" She was proceeding in this strain, but Apollo interrupted"
5168,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her. ""Say no more,"" said he; ""speech only delays punishment."" So said"
5169,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Diana also. Darting through the air, veiled in clouds, they alighted on"
5170,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the towers of the city. Spread out before the gates was a broad plain
5171,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,where the youth of the city pursued their warlike sports. The sons of
5172,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Niobe were there with the rest,--some mounted on spirited horses richly"

5182,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"that all needed not his supplication; and Apollo would have spared him,"

5240,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the displeasure of Apollo is told in the story of Linus, a beautiful"
5241,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"son of Apollo and Psamathe. In fear of her father the king, Psamathe"
5242,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"exposed the child on the mountains where, brought up by shepherds among"
5243,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the lambs, he was in tender youth torn to pieces by dogs. Meanwhile,"
5244,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Psamathe herself was driven from her father's home; wherefore Apollo
5245,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,sent against the land of the Argives a monster that for a season
5246,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"destroyed the children, but at last was slain by a noble youth named"
5247,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Cor[oe]bus. To appease the wrathful deity, a shrine was erected midway"
5248,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,between Argos and Delphi; and every year Linus and his mother were
5249,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"bewailed in melancholy lays by the mothers and children of Argos,"
5250,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,especially by such as had lost by death their own beloved. The fate of

5252,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of life under the excessive love of some shining deity,[99] typifies"
5253,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the sudden withering of herbs and flowers and of animal life,--the"
5254,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"calves and lambs, young children too, under the fierce shafts of"
5255,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"summer. The very name of Linus is taken from the refrain _ai-linon_,"
5256,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"or ""woe is me,"" of the lament anciently sung by the country people"
5257,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"when thus afflicted by the unhealthy heats, because of which the crops"
5258,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,fail and the dogs go mad and tear the little lambs to pieces. In the
5259,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,Iliad there is a beautiful picture which shows us that the song was
5260,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,not reserved completely for the dog days. It is of a vineyard teeming
5261,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,plenteously with clusters:
5262,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5263,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,And there was a pathway through it by which the vintagers might
5264,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,go. And maidens and striplings in childish glee bare the sweet
5265,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,fruit in plaited baskets. And in the midst of them a boy made
5266,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"pleasant music on a clear-toned viol, and sang thereto a sweet"

5275,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"most famous of the Centaurs, himself instructed by Apollo and Diana"
5276,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in hunting, medicine, music, and the art of prophecy. When the sage"

5278,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"forth to meet him, and at sight of the child burst into a prophetic"

5948,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"a pair of branching stag's horns grew out of the huntsman's head, his"
5949,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"neck gained in length, his ears grew sharp-pointed, his hands became"
5950,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"feet, his arms, his long legs, and his body were covered with a hairy"
5951,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"spotted hide. Fear took the place of his former boldness, and the hero"
5952,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,fled. What should he do?--go home to the palace or lie hid in the
5953,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"woods? While he hesitated his dogs saw him. Over rocks and cliffs,"
5954,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"through mountain gorges that seemed impracticable, he fled, and they"
5955,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,followed. The air resounded with the bark of the dogs. Presently one
5956,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"fastened on his back, another seized his shoulder; the rest of the"
5957,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,pack came up and buried their teeth in his flesh. His friends and
5958,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"fellow-huntsmen cheered on the dogs, and, looking everywhere for"
5959,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Actæon, called on him to join the sport. At the sound of his name,"
5960,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,he turned his head and heard them regret that he should be away. He
5961,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"earnestly wished he was. But Diana had no pity for him, nor was her"

5965,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"giant and a mighty hunter, whose prowess and manly favor gained for him"
5966,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the rare good will of Diana.
5967,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5968,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"It is related that he loved Merope, the daughter of [OE]nopion, king"
5969,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"of Chios, and sought her in marriage. He cleared the island of wild"
5970,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,beasts and brought the spoils of the chase as presents to his beloved;
5971,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"but as [OE]nopion constantly deferred his consent, Orion attempted to"
5972,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"gain possession of the maiden by violence. Her father, incensed at his"
5973,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"conduct, made Orion drunk, deprived him of his sight, and cast him out"
5974,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"on the seashore. The blinded hero, instructed by an oracle to seek"
5975,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the rays of morning, followed the sound of a Cyclops' hammer till he"
5976,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"reached Lemnos, where Vulcan, taking pity on him, gave him Cedalion,"
5977,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"one of his men, to be his guide to the abode of the sun. Placing"
5978,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"Cedalion on his shoulders, Orion proceeded to the east, and there"
5979,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"meeting the sun-god, was restored to sight by his beam.[118]"
5980,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,
5981,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,After this he dwelt as a hunter with the queen of the echoing chase;
5982,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"and it was even hinted that she loved him. Her brother, highly"
5983,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"displeased, often chid her, but to no purpose. One day, therefore,"
5984,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,observing Orion as he waded through the sea with his head just above
5985,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the water, Apollo pointed out the black object to his sister, and"
5986,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,maintained that she could not hit it. The archer goddess discharged a
5987,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,shaft with fatal aim: the waves rolled the dead body of Orion to the
5988,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"land. Then bewailing her fatal error with many tears, Diana placed him"
5989,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"among the stars, where he appears as a giant, with a girdle, sword,"

6024,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"is said to have awakened suspicion among the deities of Olympus, who"
6025,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,doubted whether she actually occupied these intervals with hunting.
6026,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"It is easy to imagine the satisfaction with which Venus, who so often"
6027,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,had been reproached by Diana with her undue fondness of beautiful
6028,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"youths, would welcome news of a corresponding weakness on the part of"
6029,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,the cold-hearted and apparently unyielding huntress queen. And such

6036,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,The heart of the goddess was unquestionably warmed by his surpassing
6037,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,beauty. She came down to him; she kissed him; she watched over him
6038,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,while he slept. She visited him again and again. But her secret could
6039,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,not long be hidden from the company of Olympus. For more and more
6040,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"frequently she was absent from her station in the sky, and toward"
6041,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"morning she was ever paler and more weary with her watching. When,"
6042,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"finally, her love was discovered, Jupiter gave Endymion, who had been"
6043,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"thus honored, a choice between death in any manner that was preferable,"
6044,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,or perpetual youth united with perpetual sleep. Endymion chose the
6045,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"latter. He still sleeps in his Carian cave, and still the mistress of"
6046,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"the moon slips from her nocturnal course to visit him. She takes care,"
6047,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"too, that his fortunes shall not suffer by his inactive life: she"

6081,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"her boy Cupid, wounded her bosom with one of his arrows. Before the"
6082,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"wound healed, she looked upon Adonis, the son of Cinyras and Myrrha,"
6083,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,and was captivated by him. She no longer took any interest in her
6084,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"favorite resorts,--Paphos, and Cnidos, and Amathus, rich in metals. She"
6085,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"absented herself even from Olympus, for Adonis was dearer to her than"
6086,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,heaven. Him she followed and bore him company. She who loved to recline
6087,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"in the shade, with no care but to cultivate her charms, now rambled"
6088,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"through the woods and over the hills, girt like the huntress Diana."
6089,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"She chased game that is safe to hunt, but kept clear of the wolves and"
6090,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"bears. She charged Adonis, too, to beware of dangerous animals. ""Be"
6091,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"brave toward the timid,"" she would say, ""courage against the courageous"
6092,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"is not safe."" Having thus, on one occasion, warned him, she mounted her"
6093,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,chariot drawn by swans and drove away through the air. But Adonis was
6094,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,too noble to heed such counsels. The dogs had roused a wild boar from
6095,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"his lair, and the youth threw his spear and wounded the animal with"
6096,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"a sidelong stroke. The beast drew out the weapon with his jaws, and,"
6097,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,"rushing after Adonis, buried his tusks in the lad's side, and stretched"
6098,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN,him dying upon the plain. The rest of the story is thus recounted:

6163,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"daughters. The charms of the two elder were more than common, but the"
6164,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],beauty of the youngest was such that the poverty of language is unable
6165,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"to express its praise. In fact, Venus found her altars deserted, while"
6166,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"men paid their vows to this virgin. When Psyche passed, the people sang"
6167,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],her praises and strewed her way with chaplets and flowers.
6168,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6169,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"This perversion of homage gave great offense to Venus, who complained"

6176,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"There were in Venus's garden two fountains,--one of sweet waters, the"

6178,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"and suspending them from the top of his quiver, hastened to the chamber"
6179,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of Psyche, whom he found asleep. He shed a few drops from the bitter"
6180,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"fountain over her lips, though the sight of her almost moved him to"
6181,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],pity; and then he touched her side with the point of his arrow. She
6182,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"awoke, and opening her eyes upon Cupid (himself invisible), so startled"
6183,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],him that in his confusion he wounded himself with his arrow. Heedless

6190,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"that they had unwittingly incurred the anger of the gods, consulted the"

6201,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"their subjects, ascended the mountain, where she was left alone."
6202,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6203,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"While Psyche stood there, panting with fear and with eyes full of"
6204,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"tears, the gentle Zephyr lifted her and, with an easy motion, bore her"
6205,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"to a flowery dale. By degrees her mind became composed, and she laid"
6206,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],herself down on the grassy bank to sleep. When she awoke refreshed with
6207,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"sleep, she beheld near by a pleasant grove of tall and stately trees."
6208,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Entering, she discovered in the midst a fountain, and fast by a palace"
6209,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"whose august front showed that it was not the work of mortal hands, but"
6210,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],the happy retreat of some god. She approached the building and entered.
6211,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Every object she met filled her with pleasure and amazement. Golden
6212,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"pillars supported the vaulted roof, and the walls were enriched with"
6213,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],carvings and paintings that represented beasts of the chase and rural
6214,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],scenes. Other apartments were filled with still other beautiful and
6215,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],precious productions of nature and art.
6216,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6217,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"While her eyes were thus occupied, the voice of an invisible being"
6218,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"addressed her: ""Sovereign lady, all that thou beholdest is thine. We"
6219,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"whose voices thou dost hear are thy servants. Retire, we pray thee, to"
6220,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"thy chamber, repose on thy bed of down, and when it may please thee"
6221,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"repair to the bath. Food awaits in the adjoining alcove."""
6222,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6223,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"After repose and the refreshment of the bath, Psyche seated herself"
6224,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"in the alcove, where, without any visible aid, a table immediately"
6225,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"presented itself, covered with delicacies and nectareous wines. Her"
6226,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"ears, too, were delighted with music from invisible performers."
6227,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6228,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],For a long time she did not see her husband. He came in the hours of
6229,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],darkness and fled before the dawn of morning; but his accents were full
6230,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],of love and inspired a like passion in her. Often she begged him to
6231,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"stay and let her behold him, but he would not consent. ""Having looked"
6232,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"upon me,"" he said, ""mayhap thou wouldst fear, mayhap adore, me; but"
6233,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],all I ask of thee is love. I would rather thou shouldst love me as an
6234,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"equal than adore me as a god."" This reasoning somewhat quieted Psyche"
6235,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"for a time. But the thought of her parents and of her sisters, left"
6236,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"in ignorance of her fate, preyed on her mind to such a degree that at"
6237,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"last, telling her distress to her lord, she drew from him an unwilling"
6238,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],consent that her sisters should be brought to see her.

6243,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6244,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Zephyr, promptly obedient, soon brought them across the mountain"
6245,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],down to their sister's valley. They embraced her. She returned their
6246,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"caresses, and then committed them to the care of her attendant voices,"
6247,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"who should refresh them in her bath and at her table, and show them"
6248,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],her treasures. The view of these delights caused envy to enter their
6249,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],bosoms. They plied their fortunate sister with questions about her
6250,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"husband. Psyche replied that he was a beautiful youth, who generally"
6251,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"spent the daytime in hunting upon the mountains. The sisters, not"
6252,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"satisfied with this reply, soon made her confess that she had never"
6253,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],seen him. Then they proceeded to fill her bosom with dark suspicions.
6254,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Probably her husband was a dreadful monster, such as the Pythian oracle"
6255,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"had prophesied. Probably he was a direful serpent, who nourished her"
6256,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],now to devour her by and by. They advised her to provide herself
6257,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"against the night with a lamp and a sharp knife, told her what to do if"
6258,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"her husband turned out the monster that they surmised, and, so saying,"
6259,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],departed.
6260,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6261,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"These persuasions Psyche resisted as well as she could, but they did"
6262,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],not fail to have their effect on her mind. She prepared a lamp and a
6263,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"sharp knife, and hid them out of sight of her husband. That night, when"
6264,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"he had fallen into his first sleep, she silently rose and uncovering"
6265,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],her lamp--
6266,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6267,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Scarce kept back a cry
6268,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],At what she saw; for there before her lay
6269,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],The very Love brighter than dawn of day;
6270,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And as he lay there smiling, her own name"
6271,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"His gentle lips in sleep began to frame,"
6272,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And, as to touch her face, his hand did move;"
6273,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"O then, indeed, her faint heart swelled for love,"
6274,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And she began to sob, and tears fell fast"
6275,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Upon the bed.--But as she turned at last
6276,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"To quench the lamp, there happed a little thing"
6277,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"That quenched her new delight, for flickering"
6278,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],The treacherous flame cast on his shoulder fair
6279,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"A burning drop; he woke, and seeing her there"
6280,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The meaning of that sad sight knew full well,"
6281,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Nor was there need the piteous tale to tell.[127]
6282,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6283,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Without a word, Cupid spread his white wings, and flew out of window."
6284,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Psyche, in vain endeavoring to follow, fell to the earth. For but an"
6285,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"instant Cupid, staying, reproached her with distrust of him. ""No other"
6286,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],punishment inflict I than to leave thee forever. Love cannot dwell with
6287,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"suspicion."" And so he flew away."
6288,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6289,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"When Psyche had recovered some degree of composure, she looked around"
6290,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],her. The palace and gardens had vanished. She found herself not far
6291,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"from the city where her sisters dwelt. Thither she repaired, and told"
6292,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"them the story of her misfortunes, whereat they inwardly rejoiced."
6293,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""For now,"" thought they, ""he will perhaps choose one of us."" With this"
6294,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"idea, they rose early the next morning and, ascending the mountain,"
6295,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"each called upon Zephyr to receive her and bear her to his lord; then,"
6296,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"leaping up, failed of the support of Zephyr, fell down the precipice,"
6297,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],and was dashed to pieces.
6298,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6299,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Psyche, meanwhile, wandered day and night, without food or repose, in"
6300,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],search of her husband. But he was lying heartsick in the chamber of
6301,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],his mother; and that goddess was absent upon her own affairs. Then the
6302,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"white sea gull which floats over the waves dived into the middle deep,"
6303,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6304,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And rowing with his glistening wings arrived
6305,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],At Aphrodite's bower beneath the sea.
6306,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6307,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"She, as yet unaware of her son's mischance, was joyously consorting"
6308,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"with her handmaidens; but he, the sea gull,"
6309,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6310,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],But he with garrulous and laughing tongue
6311,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Broke up his news; how Eros fallen sick
6312,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Lay tossing on his bed, to frenzy stung"
6313,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],By such a burn as did but barely prick:
6314,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"A little bleb, no bigger than a pease,"
6315,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Upon his shoulder 'twas, that killed his ease,"
6316,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Fevered his heart, and made his breathing thick."
6317,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6318,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""For which disaster hath he not been seen"
6319,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],This many a day at all in any place:
6320,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And thou, dear mistress,"" said he, ""hast not been"
6321,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Thyself among us now a dreary space:
6322,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And pining mortals suffer from a dearth
6323,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Of love; and for this sadness of the earth
6324,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Thy family is darkened with disgrace....
6325,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6326,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""'Tis plain that, if thy pleasure longer pause,"
6327,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Thy mighty rule on earth hath seen its day:
6328,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The race must come to perish, and no cause"
6329,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But that thou sittest with thy nymphs at play,"
6330,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],While on the Cretan hills thy truant boy
6331,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Has with his pretty mistress turned to toy,"
6332,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And, less for pain than love, now pines away.""[128]"
6333,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6334,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And Venus cried angrily, ""My son, then, has a mistress! And it is"
6335,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Psyche, who witched away my beauty and was the rival of my godhead,"
6336,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"whom he loves!"""
6337,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6338,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Therewith she issued from the sea, and, returning to her golden"
6339,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"chamber, found there the lad sick, as she had heard, and cried from"
6340,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the doorway, ""Well done, truly! to trample thy mother's precepts under"
6341,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"foot, to spare my enemy that cross of an unworthy love; nay, unite her"
6342,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"to thyself, child as thou art, that I might have a daughter-in-law who"
6343,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"hates me! I will make thee repent of thy sport, and the savor of thy"
6344,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"marriage bitter. There is one who shall chasten this body of thine, put"
6345,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"out thy torch, and unstring thy bow. Not till she has plucked forth"
6346,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"that hair, into which so oft these hands have smoothed the golden"
6347,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"light, and sheared away thy wings, shall I feel the injury done me"
6348,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"avenged."" And with this she hastened in anger from the doors."
6349,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6350,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And Ceres and Juno met her, and sought to know the meaning of her"
6351,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"troubled countenance. ""Ye come in season,"" she cried; ""I pray you, find"
6352,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],for me Psyche. It must needs be that ye have heard the disgrace of my
6353,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"house."" And they, ignorant of what was done, would have soothed her"
6354,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"anger, saying, ""What fault, Mistress, hath thy son committed, that thou"
6355,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],wouldst destroy the girl he loves? Knowest thou not that he is now of
6356,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],age? Because he wears his years so lightly must he seem to thee ever to
6357,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"be a child? Wilt thou forever thus pry into the pastimes of thy son,"
6358,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"always accusing his wantonness, and blaming in him those delicate wiles"
6359,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"which are all thine own?"" Thus, in secret fear of the boy's bow, did"
6360,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"they seek to please him with their gracious patronage. But Venus, angry"
6361,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"at their light taking of her wrongs, turned her back upon them, and"
6362,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],with hasty steps made her way once more to the sea.[129]
6363,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6364,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And soon after, Psyche herself reached the temple of Ceres, where she"
6365,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],won the favor of the goddess by arranging in due order the heaps of
6366,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],mingled grain and ears and the carelessly scattered harvest implements
6367,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"that lay there. The holy Ceres then counseled her to submit to Venus,"
6368,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"to try humbly to win her forgiveness, and, mayhap, through her favor"
6369,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],regain the lover that was lost.
6370,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6371,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Obeying the commands of Ceres, Psyche took her way to the temple"
6372,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],of the golden-crowned Cypris. That goddess received her with angry
6373,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"countenance, called her an undutiful and faithless servant, taunted"
6374,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"her with the wound given to her husband, and insisted that for so"
6375,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],ill-favored a girl there was no way of meriting a lover save by dint
6376,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],of industry. Thereupon she ordered Psyche to be led to the storehouse
6377,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of the temple, where was laid up a great quantity of wheat, barley,"
6378,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"millet, vetches, beans, and lentils prepared for food for her pigeons,"
6379,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"and gave order, ""Take and separate all these grains, putting all of the"
6380,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"same kind in a parcel by themselves,--and see that thou get it done"
6381,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"before evening."" This said, Venus departed and left the girl to her"
6382,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"task. But Psyche, in perfect consternation at the enormous task, sat"
6383,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],stupid and silent; nor would the work have been accomplished had not
6384,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Cupid stirred up the ants to take compassion on her. They separated the
6385,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"pile, sorting each kind to its parcel and vanishing out of sight in a"
6386,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],moment.
6387,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6388,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"At the approach of twilight, Cytherea returned from the banquet of the"
6389,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"gods, breathing odors and crowned with roses. Seeing the task done, she"
6390,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"promptly exclaimed, ""This is no work of thine, wicked one, but his,"
6391,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"whom to thine own and his misfortune thou hast enticed,""--threw the"
6392,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"girl a piece of black bread for her supper, and departed."
6393,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6394,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Next morning, however, the goddess, ordering Psyche to be summoned,"
6395,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],commanded her to fetch a sample of wool gathered from each of the
6396,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],golden-shining sheep that fed beyond a neighboring river. Obediently
6397,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the princess went to the riverside, prepared to do her best to execute"
6398,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],the command. But the god of that stream inspired the reeds with
6399,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],harmonious murmurs that dissuaded her from venturing among the golden
6400,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"rams while they raged under the influence of the rising sun. Psyche,"
6401,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"observing the directions of the compassionate river-god, crossed"
6402,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"when the noontide sun had driven the cattle to the shade, gathered"
6403,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the woolly gold from the bushes where it was clinging, and returned"
6404,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"to Venus with her arms full of the shining fleece. But, far from"
6405,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"commending her, that implacable mistress said, ""I know very well that"
6406,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],by the aid of another thou hast done this; not yet am I assured that
6407,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"thou hast skill to be of use. Here, now, take this box to Proserpine"
6408,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"and say, 'My mistress Venus entreats thee to send her a little of thy"
6409,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"beauty, for in tending her sick son she hath lost some of her own.'"""
6410,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6411,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Psyche, satisfied that her destruction was at hand, doomed as she"
6412,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"was to travel afoot to Erebus, thought to shorten the journey by"
6413,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],precipitating herself at once from the summit of a tower. But a voice
6414,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"from the tower, restraining her from this rash purpose, explained how"
6415,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],by a certain cave she might reach the realm of Pluto; how she might
6416,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"avoid the peril of the road, pass by Cerberus, and prevail on Charon to"
6417,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"take her across the black river and bring her back again. The voice,"
6418,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"also, especially cautioned her against prying into the box filled with"
6419,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],the beauty of Proserpine.
6420,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6421,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"So, taking heed to her ways, the unfortunate girl traveled safely to"
6422,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the kingdom of Pluto. She was admitted to the palace of Proserpine,"
6423,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"where, contenting herself with plain fare instead of the delicious"
6424,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"banquet that was offered her, she delivered her message from Venus."
6425,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Presently the box, filled with the precious commodity, was restored to"
6426,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],her; and glad was she to come out once more into the light of day.
6427,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6428,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But having got so far successfully through her dangerous task, a desire"
6429,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"seized her to examine the contents of the box, and to spread the least"
6430,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],bit of the divine beauty on her cheeks that she might appear to more
6431,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],advantage in the eyes of her beloved husband.
6432,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6433,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Therewith down by the wayside did she sit
6434,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And turned the box round, long regarding it;"
6435,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But at the last, with trembling hands, undid"
6436,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The clasp, and fearfully raised up the lid;"
6437,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But what was there she saw not, for her head"
6438,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Fell back, and nothing she rememberèd"
6439,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Of all her life, yet nought of rest she had,"
6440,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],The hope of which makes hapless mortals glad;
6441,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],For while her limbs were sunk in deadly sleep
6442,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Most like to death, over her heart 'gan creep"
6443,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Ill dreams; so that for fear and great distress
6444,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"She would have cried, but in her helplessness"
6445,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Could open not her mouth, or frame a word.[130]"
6446,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6447,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But Cupid, now recovered from his wound, slipped through a crack in the"
6448,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"window of his chamber, flew to the spot where his beloved lay, gathered"
6449,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"up the sleep from her body and inclosed it again in the box, then"

6458,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Then Cupid, swift as lightning penetrating the heights of heaven,"
6459,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],presented himself before Jupiter with his supplication. Jupiter lent a
6460,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],favoring ear and pleaded the cause of the lovers with Venus. Gaining
6461,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"her consent, he ordered Mercury to convey Psyche to the heavenly"
6462,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"abodes. On her advent, the king of the immortals, handing her a cup of"
6463,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"ambrosia, said, ""Drink this, Psyche, and be immortal. Thy Cupid shall"
6464,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],never break from the knot in which he is tied; these nuptials shall

6466,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6467,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Thus Psyche was at last united to Cupid; and in due season a daughter

6470,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],The allegory of Cupid and Psyche is well presented in the following

6473,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"They wove bright fables in the days of old,"
6474,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],When reason borrowed fancy's painted wings;
6475,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"When truth's clear river flowed o'er sands of gold,"
6476,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And told in song its high and mystic things!
6477,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And such the sweet and solemn tale of her
6478,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The pilgrim-heart, to whom a dream was given,"
6479,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"That led her through the world,--Love's worshiper,--"
6480,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],To seek on earth for him whose home was heaven!

6516,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"I wandered in a forest thoughtlessly,"
6517,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,"

6539,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,"

6579,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,"
6580,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],To let the warm Love in!
6581,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6582,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],The loves of the devotees of Venus are as the sands of the sea for

6592,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"B[oe]otia, had been warned by an oracle that marriage would be fatal"
6593,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],to her happiness. Consequently she fled the society of men and devoted
6594,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"herself to the sports of the chase. Fair, fearless, swift, and free,"
6595,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"in beauty and in desire she was a Cynthia,--of mortal form and with a"
6596,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"woman's heart. To all suitors (for she had many) she made answer: ""I"
6597,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],will be the prize of him only who shall conquer me in the race; but
6598,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"death must be the penalty of all who try and fail."" In spite of this"
6599,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],hard condition some would try. Of one such race Hippomenes was to be
6600,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"judge. It was his thought, at first, that these suitors risked too much"
6601,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],for a wife. But when he saw Atalanta lay aside her robe for the race
6602,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"with one of them, he changed his mind and began to swell with envy of"
6603,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],whomsoever seemed likely to win.
6604,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6605,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],The virgin darted forward. As she ran she looked more beautiful than
6606,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],ever. The breezes gave wings to her feet; her hair flew over her
6607,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"shoulders, and the gay fringe of her garment fluttered behind her. A"
6608,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"ruddy hue tinged the whiteness of her skin, such as a crimson curtain"
6609,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],casts on a marble wall. Her competitor was distanced and was put to
6610,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"death without mercy. Hippomenes, not daunted by this result, fixed his"
6611,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"eyes on the virgin and said, ""Why boast of beating those laggards? I"
6612,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"offer myself for the contest."" Atalanta looked at him with pity in"
6613,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],her face and hardly knew whether she would rather conquer so goodly a
6614,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"youth or not. While she hesitated, the spectators grew impatient for"
6615,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],the contest and her father prompted her to prepare. Then Hippomenes
6616,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"addressed a prayer to Cypris: ""Help me, Venus, for thou hast impelled"

6664,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"happiness, after all, forgot to pay due honor to Aphrodite, and the"
6665,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],goddess was provoked at their ingratitude. She caused them to give
6666,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],offense to Cybele. That powerful goddess took from them their human

6672,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],=104 Hero and Leander= were star-crossed lovers of later classical
6673,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"fiction.[134] Although their story is not of supernatural beings,"
6674,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"or of events necessarily influenced by supernatural agencies, and"
6675,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"therefore not mythical in the strict sense of the word, it deserves"
6676,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],to be included here both because of its pathetic beauty and its long
6677,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],literary tradition. The poet Marlowe puts the story into English thus:
6678,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6679,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,"
6680,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"In view and opposite two cities stood,"
6681,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might"
6682,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight."
6683,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,"
6684,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,"

6686,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Where she should sit, for men to gaze upon...."
6687,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,"
6688,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And, looking in her face, was strooken blind."
6689,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But this is true: so like was one the other,"
6690,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],As he imagined Hero was his mother;
6691,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,"
6692,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,"
6693,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And laid his childish head upon her breast,"
6694,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And, with still panting rockt, there took his rest."

6696,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"In Abydos dwelt the manly Leander, who, as luck would have it,"
6697,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"bethought himself one day of the festival of Venus in Sestos, and"

6711,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And thus Leander was enamourèd.
6712,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gaz'd,"
6713,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Till with the fire, that from his countenance blaz'd,"

6720,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"We wish that one should lose, the other win;"
6721,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And one especially do we affect
6722,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:"
6723,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The reason no man knows; let it suffice,"
6724,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
6725,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:"
6726,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?"
6727,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6728,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],He kneel'd; but unto _her_ devoutly prayed:
6729,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said,"
6730,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""Were I the saint he worships, I would hear him"";"
6731,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And, as she spake those words, came somewhat near him."
6732,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],He started up; she blush'd as one asham'd;
6733,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Wherewith Leander much more was inflam'd.
6734,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],He touch'd her hand; in touching it she trembled:
6735,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Love deeply grounded, hardly is dissembled...."
6736,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6737,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"So they conversed by touch of hands, till Leander, plucking up courage,"
6738,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"began to plead with words, with sighs and tears."
6739,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6740,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"These arguments he us'd, and many more;"
6741,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Wherewith she yielded, that was won before."
6742,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Hero's looks yielded, but her words made war:"
6743,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Women are won when they begin to jar.
6744,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Thus having swallow'd Cupid's golden hook,"
6745,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The more she striv'd, the deeper was she strook:"
6746,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Yet, evilly feigning anger, strove she still,"
6747,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And would be thought to grant against her will.
6748,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"So having paus'd awhile, at last she said,"
6749,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""Who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid?"
6750,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Ay me! such words as these should I abhor,"
6751,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And yet I like them for the orator."""
6752,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"With that Leander stoop'd to have embrac'd her,"
6753,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But from his spreading arms away she cast her,"
6754,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And thus bespake him: ""Gentle youth, forbear"
6755,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"To touch the sacred garments which I wear."" ..."
6756,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6757,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Then she told him of the turret by the murmuring sea where all day long
6758,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],she tended Venus' swans and sparrows:
6759,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6760,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""Come thither."" As she spake this, her tongue tripp'd,"
6761,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"For unawares, ""Come thither,"" from her slipp'd;"
6762,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And suddenly her former color chang'd,"
6763,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And here and there her eyes through anger rang'd;
6764,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And, like a planet moving several ways"
6765,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"At one self instant, she, poor soul, assays,"
6766,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Loving, not to love at all, and every part"
6767,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Strove to resist the motions of her heart:
6768,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And hands so pure, so innocent, nay, such"
6769,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"As might have made Heaven stoop to have a touch,"
6770,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Did she uphold to Venus, and again"
6771,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Vow'd spotless chastity; but all in vain;
6772,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Cupid beats down her prayers with his wings....

6776,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],From the painting by Keller]
6777,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6778,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],For a season all went well. Guided by a torch which his mistress reared
6779,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"upon the tower, he was wont of nights to swim the strait that he might"
6780,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],enjoy her company. But one night a tempest arose and the sea was rough;
6781,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],his strength failed and he was drowned. The waves bore his body to
6782,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the European shore, where Hero became aware of his death, and in her"
6783,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],despair cast herself into the sea and perished.
6784,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6785,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],A picture of the drowning Leander is thus described by Keats:[135]
6786,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6787,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Come hither all sweet maidens soberly,"
6788,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Down looking aye, and with a chasten'd light,"
6789,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Hid in the fringe of your eyelids white,"
6790,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And meekly let your fair hands joinèd be,"
6791,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"As if so gentle that ye could not see,"
6792,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Untouch'd, a victim of your beauty bright,"
6793,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Sinking away to his young spirit's night,"
6794,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Sinking bewilder'd 'mid the dreary sea:
6795,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],'Tis young Leander toiling to his death;
6796,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Nigh swooning he doth purse his weary lips
6797,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"For Hero's cheek, and smiles against her smile."
6798,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],O horrid dream! see how his body dips
6799,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Dead-heavy; arms and shoulders gleam awhile;
6800,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],He's gone; up bubbles all his amorous breath!
6801,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6802,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],=105. Pygmalion and the Statue.=[136] Pygmalion saw so much to blame
6803,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"in women, that he came at last to abhor the sex and resolved to live"
6804,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"unmarried. He was a sculptor, and had made with wonderful skill a"
6805,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"statue of ivory, so beautiful that no living woman was to compare with"
6806,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],it. It was indeed the perfect semblance of a maiden that seemed to
6807,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],be alive and that was prevented from moving only by modesty. His art
6808,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"was so perfect that it concealed itself, and its product looked like"
6809,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],the workmanship of nature. Pygmalion at last fell in love with his
6810,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],counterfeit creation. Oftentimes he laid his hand upon it as if to
6811,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"assure himself whether it were living or not, and could not even then"
6812,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],believe that it was only ivory.
6813,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6814,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The festival of Venus was at hand,--a festival celebrated with great"
6815,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"pomp at Cyprus. Victims were offered, the altars smoked, and the odor"
6816,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],of incense filled the air. When Pygmalion had performed his part in the
6817,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"solemnities, he stood before the altar and, according to one of our"
6818,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"poets, timidly said:"
6819,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6820,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"O Aphrodite, kind and fair,"
6821,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"That what thou wilt canst give,"
6822,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Oh, listen to a sculptor's prayer,"
6823,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And bid mine image live!
6824,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],For me the ivory and gold
6825,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],That clothe her cedar frame
6826,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Are beautiful, indeed, but cold;"
6827,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Ah, touch them with thy flame!"
6828,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Oh, bid her move those lips of rose,"
6829,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Bid float that golden hair,"
6830,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And let her choose me, as I chose,"
6831,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],This fairest of the fair!
6832,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And then an altar in thy court
6833,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"I'll offer, decked with gold;"
6834,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And there thy servants shall resort,"
6835,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Thy doves be bought and sold![137]
6836,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6837,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"According to another version of the story, he said not, ""bid mine image"
6838,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"live,"" but ""one like my ivory virgin."" At any rate, with such a prayer"
6839,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"he threw incense on the flame of the altar. Whereupon Venus, as an omen"
6840,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of her favor, caused the flame to shoot up thrice a fiery point into"
6841,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],the air.
6842,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6843,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"When Pygmalion reached his home, to his amazement he saw before him his"
6844,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],statue garlanded with flowers.
6845,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6846,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Yet while he stood, and knew not what to do"
6847,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"With yearning, a strange thrill of hope there came,"
6848,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"A shaft of new desire now pierced him through,"
6849,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And therewithal a soft voice called his name,"
6850,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And when he turned, with eager eyes aflame,"
6851,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],He saw betwixt him and the setting sun
6852,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],The lively image of his lovèd one.
6853,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6854,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"He trembled at the sight, for though her eyes,"
6855,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Her very lips, were such as he had made,"
6856,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And though her tresses fell but in such guise
6857,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"As he had wrought them, now was she arrayed"
6858,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],In that fair garment that the priests had laid
6859,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Upon the goddess on that very morn,"
6860,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Dyed like the setting sun upon the corn.
6861,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6862,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Speechless he stood, but she now drew anear,"
6863,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Simple and sweet as she was wont to be,"
6864,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And once again her silver voice rang clear,"
6865,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Filling his soul with great felicity,"
6866,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And thus she spoke, ""Wilt thou not come to me,"
6867,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"O dear companion of my new-found life,"
6868,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],For I am called thy lover and thy wife?...
6869,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6870,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""My sweet,"" she said, ""as yet I am not wise,"
6871,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Or stored with words aright the tale to tell,"
6872,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],But listen: when I opened first mine eyes
6873,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"I stood within the niche thou knowest well,"
6874,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And from my hand a heavy thing there fell
6875,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Carved like these flowers, nor could I see things clear,"
6876,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But with a strange, confusèd noise could hear."
6877,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6878,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"""At last mine eyes could see a woman fair,"
6879,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"But awful as this round white moon o'erhead,"
6880,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"So that I trembled when I saw her there,"
6881,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"For with my life was born some touch of dread,"
6882,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"And therewithal I heard her voice that said,"
6883,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"'Come down and learn to love and be alive,"
6884,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"For thee, a well-prized gift, to-day I give.'""[138]"
6885,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6886,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],A fuller account of Venus' address to the statue is the following:
6887,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6888,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"O maiden, in mine image made!"
6889,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],O grace that shouldst endure!
6890,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"While temples fall, and empires fade,"
6891,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Immaculately pure:
6892,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Exchange this endless life of art
6893,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"For beauty that must die,"
6894,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],And blossom with a beating heart
6895,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Into mortality!
6896,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Change, golden tresses of her hair,"
6897,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],To gold that turns to gray;
6898,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Change, silent lips, forever fair,"
6899,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],To lips that have their day!
6900,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Oh, perfect arms, grow soft with life,"
6901,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Wax warm, ere cold ye wane;"
6902,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Wake, woman's heart, from peace to strife,"
6903,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"To love, to joy, to pain![139]"
6904,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6905,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The maiden was called Galatea. Venus blessed the nuptials, and from"
6906,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the union Paphos was born, by whose name the city, sacred to Venus, is"
6907,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],known.
6908,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6909,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],=106. Pyramus and Thisbe.=[140] Pyramus was the handsomest youth and
6910,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Thisbe the fairest maiden in Babylonia, where Semiramis reigned."
6911,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Their parents occupied adjoining houses. Propinquity brought the young
6912,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"people together, and acquaintance ripened into love. They would gladly"
6913,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"have married, but their parents forbade. One thing, however, parents"
6914,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"could not forbid (for Venus and Cupid favored the match),--that love"
6915,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],should glow with equal ardor in the bosoms of both. They conversed by
6916,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"signs and glances, and the fire burned the more intensely that it was"
6917,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"covered. In the wall between the two houses there was a crack, caused"
6918,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],by some fault in the structure. It afforded a passage to the voice;
6919,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],and tender messages passed back and forth through the gap. When night
6920,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"came and they must say farewell, the lovers pressed their lips upon the"
6921,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"wall, she on her side, he on his."

6927,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"One morning, when Aurora had put out the stars and the sun had melted"
6928,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the frost from the grass, they met at the accustomed spot and arranged"
6929,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"a meeting for that night at a well-known edifice, standing without the"
6930,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"city's bounds,--the Tomb of Ninus. The one who first arrived should"
6931,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],await the other at the foot of a white mulberry tree near a cool
6932,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"spring. Evening came. Thisbe, arriving first, sat alone by the monument"
6933,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"in the dim light of the evening. Suddenly she descried a lioness, her"
6934,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"jaws reeking with recent slaughter, approaching the fountain to slake"
6935,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"her thirst. The maiden fled at the sight, dropping her veil as she ran."
6936,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"The lioness, after drinking at the spring, turned toward the woods,"
6937,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"and, seeing the veil on the ground, tossed and rent it with her bloody"
6938,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],mouth.
6939,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6940,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],Now Pyramus approached the place of meeting. He saw in the sand the
6941,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"footsteps of the lion. He found the veil all rent and bloody. ""O,"
6942,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"hapless girl,"" cried he, ""I have been the cause of thy death; but I"
6943,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"follow thee!"" So saying, he drew his sword and plunged it into his"
6944,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],heart. The blood spurted from the wound and tinged the white mulberries
6945,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of the tree all red, and, sinking into the earth, reached the roots, so"
6946,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],that the sanguine hue mounted through the trunk to the fruit.
6947,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],
6948,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"By this time Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet wishing not to"
6949,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously forth, looking anxiously for"
6950,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"the youth, eager to tell him the danger she had escaped. When she came"
6951,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"to the spot and saw the changed color of the mulberries, she doubted"
6952,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"whether it was the same place. While she hesitated, she saw the form of"
6953,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],her lover struggling in the agonies of death. She screamed and beat her
6954,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"breast, she embraced the lifeless body, poured tears into its wounds,"
6955,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"and imprinted kisses on the cold lips. ""O, Pyramus,"" she cried, ""what"
6956,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"has done this? It is thine own Thisbe that speaks."" At the name of"
6957,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"Thisbe Pyramus opened his eyes, then closed them again. She saw her"
6958,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"veil stained with blood and the scabbard empty of its sword. ""Thine own"
6959,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"hand has slain thee, and for my sake,"" she said. ""I, too, can be brave"
6960,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"for once, and my love is as strong as thine. But ye, unhappy parents"
6961,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of us both, deny us not our united request. As love and death have"
6962,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"joined us, let one tomb contain us. And thou, tree, retain the marks"
6963,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of slaughter. Let thy berries still serve for memorials of our blood."""
6964,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"So saying, she plunged the sword into her breast. The two bodies were"
6965,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"buried in one sepulcher, and the tree henceforth produced purple"

6969,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of Paphos and Amathus,[141] in the guise of an ugly crone, begged a"
6970,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"passage, which was so good-naturedly granted that in recompense she"
6971,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],bestowed on the ferryman a salve possessing magical properties of youth
6972,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"and beauty. As a consequence of the use made of it by Phaon, the women"
6973,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"of Lesbos went wild for love of him. None, however, admired him more"
6974,THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS[125],"than the poetess Sappho, who addressed to him some of her warmest and"

7236,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,who nourished his infancy and childhood and for their care were placed

7239,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"a nymph, and oldest of the Satyrs. Silenus was probably an indulgent"

7243,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its
7244,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,precious juice; but Juno struck him with madness and drove him forth
7245,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,a wanderer through various parts of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess
7246,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,Rhea cured him and taught him her religious rites; and then he set
7247,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"out on a progress through Asia, teaching the people the cultivation"
7248,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition
7249,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"to India, which is said to have lasted several years. Returning in"

7251,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,opposed by certain princes who dreaded the disorders and madness it

7254,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"Cadmus, was king. Pentheus, however, had no respect for the new worship"

7304,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"Soon the god looked out over the sea and said in a voice of weeping,"
7305,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"""Sailors, these are not the shores ye promised me; yonder island is"

7307,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"Acetes wept to hear him, but the crew laughed at both of them and sped"
7308,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"the vessel fast over the sea. All at once it stopped in mid-sea, as"
7309,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"fast as if it were fixed on the ground. The men, astonished, pulled at"
7310,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"their oars and spread more sail, but all in vain. Ivy twined round the"
7311,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"oars and clung to the sails, with heavy clusters of berries. A vine"
7312,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,laden with grapes ran up the mast and along the sides of the vessel.
7313,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"The sound of flutes was heard, and the odor of fragrant wine spread all"
7314,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,around. The god himself had a chaplet of vine leaves and bore in his
7315,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"hand a spear wreathed with ivy. Tigers crouched at his feet, and forms"
7316,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,of lynxes and spotted panthers played around him. The whole crew became
7317,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,dolphins and swam about the ship. Of twenty men Acetes alone was left.
7318,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"""Fear not,"" said the god; ""steer towards Naxos."" The pilot obeyed, and"
7319,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"when they arrived there, kindled the altars and celebrated the sacred"

7324,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"So far had Acetes advanced in his narrative, when Pentheus,"
7325,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"interrupting, ordered him off to his death. But from this fate the"
7326,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"pilot, rendered invisible by his patron deity, was straightway rescued."
7327,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,
7328,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"Meanwhile, the mountain Cithæron seemed alive with worshipers, and the"
7329,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"cries of the Bacchanals resounded on every side. Pentheus, angered by"
7330,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"the noise, penetrated through the wood and reached an open space where"
7331,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,the chief scene of the orgies met his eyes. At the same moment the
7332,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"women saw him, among them his mother Agave, and Autonoë and Ino, her"
7333,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"sisters. Taking him for a wild boar, they rushed upon him and tore him"

7340,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,Theseus. How Bacchus comforted her is related in another section. How

7378,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"from the company of Bacchus in an intoxicated condition, was found by"
7379,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"some peasants, who carried him to their king, Midas. Midas entertained"
7380,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,him royally and on the eleventh day restored him in safety to his
7381,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,divine pupil. Whereupon Bacchus offered Midas his choice of a reward.
7382,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,The king asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into
7383,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,gold. Bacchus consented. Midas hastened to put his new-acquired power
7384,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"to the test. A twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, became"
7385,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,gold in his hand. He took up a stone; it changed to gold. He touched
7386,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,a sod with the same result. He took an apple from the tree; you would
7387,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,have thought he had robbed the garden of the Hesperides. He ordered
7388,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"his servants, then, to set an excellent meal on the table. But, to his"
7389,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"dismay, when he touched bread, it hardened in his hand; when he put a"
7390,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"morsel to his lips, it defied his teeth. He took a glass of wine, but"
7391,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,it flowed down his throat like melted gold.
7392,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,
7393,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,He strove to divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he had
7394,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"lately coveted. He raised his arms, all shining with gold, in prayer"
7395,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"to Bacchus, begging to be delivered from this glittering destruction."
7396,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,The merciful deity heard and sent him to wash away his fault and its
7397,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,punishment in the fountainhead of the river Pactolus. Scarce had Midas
7398,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"touched the waters, before the gold-creating power passed into them,"
7399,MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH,"and the river sands became golden, as they remain to this day."

7434,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,=115. The Rape of Proserpine.=[151] When the giants were imprisoned
7435,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"by Jupiter under Mount Ætna, Pluto (Hades) feared lest the shock of"
7436,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,their fall might expose his kingdom to the light of day. Under this
7437,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"apprehension, he mounted his chariot drawn by black horses, and made a"
7438,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,circuit of inspection to satisfy himself of the extent of the damage.
7439,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"While he was thus engaged, Venus, who was sitting on Mount Eryx playing"
7440,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"with her boy Cupid, espied him and said, ""My son, take thy darts which"
7441,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"subdue all, even Jove himself, and send one into the breast of yonder"
7442,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"dark monarch, who rules the realm of Tartarus. Dost thou not see that"
7443,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,even in heaven some despise our power? Minerva and Diana defy us; and
7444,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"there is that daughter of Ceres, goddess of earth, who threatens to"
7445,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"follow their example. Now, if thou regardest thine own interest or"
7446,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"mine, join these two in one."" The boy selected his sharpest and truest"

7449,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"In the vale of Enna is a lake embowered in woods, where Spring"

7453,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,
7454,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"Sacred Goddess, Mother Earth,"
7455,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"Thou from whose immortal bosom,"

7468,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"Pluto saw her, loved her, and carried her off. She screamed for help to"
7469,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,her mother and her companions; but the ravisher urged on his steeds and
7470,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"outdistanced pursuit. When he reached the river Cyane, it opposed his"
7471,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"passage, whereupon he struck the bank with his trident, and the earth"
7472,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,opened and gave him a passage to Tartarus.
7473,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,
7474,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,=116. The Wanderings of Ceres.=[153] Ceres (Demeter) sought her
7475,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"daughter all the world over. Bright-haired Aurora, when she came"
7476,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"forth in the morning, and Hesperus, when he led out the stars in the"
7477,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"evening, found her still busy in the search. At length, weary and"
7478,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"sad, she sat down upon a stone, and remained nine days and nights in"
7479,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"the open air, under the sunlight and moonlight and falling showers."
7480,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"It was where now stands the city of Eleusis, near the home of an old"
7481,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"man named Celeus. His little girl, pitying the old woman, said to"
7482,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"her, ""Mother,""--and the name was sweet to the ears of Ceres,--""why"
7483,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"sittest thou here alone upon the rocks?"" The old man begged her to"
7484,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"come into his cottage. She declined. He urged her. ""Go in peace,"" she"
7485,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"replied, ""and be happy in thy daughter; I have lost mine."" But their"
7486,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,compassion finally prevailed. Ceres rose from the stone and went with
7487,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"them. As they walked, Celeus said that his only son lay sick of a"
7488,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"fever. The goddess stooped and gathered some poppies. Then, entering"
7489,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"the cottage, where all was in distress,--for the boy Triptolemus"
7490,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"seemed past recovery,--she restored the child to life and health with"
7491,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,a kiss. In grateful happiness the family spread the table and put upon
7492,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"it curds and cream, apples, and honey in the comb. While they ate,"
7493,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"Ceres mingled poppy juice in the milk of the boy. When night came, she"
7494,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"arose and, taking the sleeping boy, molded his limbs with her hands,"
7495,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"and uttered over him three times a solemn charm, then went and laid"
7496,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"him in the ashes. His mother, who had been watching what her guest"
7497,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"was doing, sprang forward with a cry and snatched the child from the"
7498,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"fire. Then Ceres assumed her own form, and a divine splendor shone"
7499,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"all around. While they were overcome with astonishment, she said,"
7500,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"""Mother, thou hast been cruel in thy fondness; for I would have made"
7501,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"thy son immortal. Nevertheless, he shall be great and useful. He shall"
7502,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,teach men the use of the plow and the rewards which labor can win from
7503,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"the soil."" So saying, she wrapped a cloud about her and mounting her"
7504,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,chariot rode away.

7508,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,Ceres continued her search for her daughter till at length she returned
7509,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"to Sicily, whence she first had set out, and stood by the banks of the"
7510,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,river Cyane. The river nymph would have told the goddess all she had
7511,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she ventured merely"
7512,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her flight, and"
7513,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"float it to the feet of the mother. Ceres, seeing this, laid her curse"
7514,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,on the innocent earth in which her daughter had disappeared. Then
7515,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"succeeded drought and famine, flood and plague, until, at last, the"
7516,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,fountain Arethusa made intercession for the land. For she had seen that
7517,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"it opened only unwillingly to the might of Pluto; and she had also, in"
7518,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"her flight from Alpheüs through the lower regions of the earth, beheld"
7519,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"the missing Proserpine. She said that the daughter of Ceres seemed sad,"
7520,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,but no longer showed alarm in her countenance. Her look was such as
7521,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"became a queen,--the queen of Erebus; the powerful bride of the monarch"
7522,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,of the realms of the dead.

7527,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the restitution of her
7528,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,daughter. Jupiter consented on condition that Proserpine should not
7529,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"during her stay in the lower world have taken any food; otherwise, the"
7530,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"Fates forbade her release. Accordingly, Mercury was sent, accompanied"
7531,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"by Spring, to demand Proserpine of Pluto. The wily monarch consented;"
7532,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"but alas! the maiden had taken a pomegranate which Pluto offered her,"
7533,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"and had sucked the sweet pulp from a few of the seeds. A compromise,"
7534,FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD,"however, was effected by which she was to pass half the time with her"

7915,THE SEA],"married Halcyone, daughter of Æolus.[164] Their reign was happy until"
7916,THE SEA],the brother of Ceyx met his death. The direful prodigies that followed
7917,THE SEA],this event made Ceyx feel that the gods were hostile to him. He thought
7918,THE SEA],best therefore to make a voyage to Claros in Ionia to consult the
7919,THE SEA],oracle of Apollo. In spite of his wife's entreaties (for as daughter
7920,THE SEA],"of the god of winds she knew how dreadful a thing a storm at sea was),"
7921,THE SEA],Ceyx set sail. He was shipwrecked and drowned. His last prayer was that
7922,THE SEA],"the waves might bear his body to the sight of Halcyone, and that it"

7924,THE SEA],
7925,THE SEA],"In the meanwhile, Halcyone counted the days till her husband's promised"

7927,THE SEA],"to Juno. The goddess, at last, could not bear to be further pleaded"
7928,THE SEA],"with for one already dead. Calling Iris, she enjoined her to approach"

7938,THE SEA],"never there calls aloud to Aurora, nor watchdog nor goose disturbs the"
7939,THE SEA],"silence. No wild beast, nor cattle, nor branch moved with the wind,"

7942,THE SEA],"Poppies grow before the door of the cave, from whose juices Night"
7943,THE SEA],distills slumbers which she scatters over the darkened earth. There
7944,THE SEA],"is no gate to creak on its hinges, nor any watchman. In the midst, on"
7945,THE SEA],a couch of black ebony adorned with black plumes and black curtains
7946,THE SEA],"the god reclines, his limbs relaxed in sleep. Around him lie dreams,"
7947,THE SEA],"resembling all various forms, as many as the harvest bears stalks, or"

7949,THE SEA],
7950,THE SEA],"Brushing away the dreams that hovered around her, Iris lit up the cave"

7953,THE SEA],
7954,THE SEA],"Then Iris hasted away from the drowsiness creeping over her, and"

7956,THE SEA],"sons, Morpheus, the most expert in counterfeiting forms of men, to"
7957,THE SEA],perform the command of Iris; then laid his head on his pillow and
7958,THE SEA],yielded himself again to grateful repose.

7968,THE SEA],"husband. In despair, leaping from the mole, she was changed instantly"
7969,THE SEA],"to a bird, and poured forth a song of grief as she flew. By the mercy"

7977,THE SEA],"her latest, was Tithonus, son of Laomedon, king of Troy. She stole him"
7978,THE SEA],away and prevailed on Jupiter to grant him immortality; but forgetting
7979,THE SEA],"to have youth joined in the gift, after some time she began to discern,"
7980,THE SEA],"to her great mortification, that he was growing old. When his hair was"
7981,THE SEA],"white she left his society; but he still had the range of her palace,"
7982,THE SEA],"lived on ambrosial food, and was clad in celestial raiment. In time"
7983,THE SEA],he lost the power of using his limbs; and then she shut him up in his

8866,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"=142. Glaucus and Scylla.=[186] Another deity of the sea was Glaucus,"
8867,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,the son of that Sisyphus who was punished in Hades for his treachery
8868,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,to the gods. Glaucus had been a comely young fisherman; but having
8869,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,noticed that a certain herb revived fishes after they were brought to
8870,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"land, he ate of it and suffered metamorphosis into something new and"
8871,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"strange, half man, half fish, and after the fashion of a sea-god. Of"
8872,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"his experience during this ""sea change"" the following is an account:"
8873,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8874,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,I plunged for life or death. To interknit
8875,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff
8876,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,Might seem a work of pain; so not enough
8877,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,"
8878,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt
8879,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;
8880,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Forgetful utterly of self-intent,"
8881,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.
8882,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,Then like a new-fledged bird that first doth show
8883,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,"
8884,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,I tried in fear the pinions of my will.
8885,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,'Twas freedom! and at once I visited
8886,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,The ceaseless wonders of this ocean bed.[187]
8887,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8888,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,He became guardian of fishes and divers and of those who go down to
8889,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"the sea in ships. Later, being infatuated of the fair virgin Scylla"
8890,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"(daughter of the sea-god Phorcys and granddaughter of Pontus), he"
8891,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"paid his court to her, but the maiden rejected him. Whereupon, in"
8892,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"desperation, Glaucus sought the aid of Circe, an enchantress. She,"
8893,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"because she coveted for herself the handsome sea-green god, transformed"
8894,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,her rival into a monster hideously fashioned of serpents and barking
8895,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,dogs.[188] In this shape Scylla thereafter infested the shore of Sicily
8896,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"and worked evil to mariners,[189] till finally she was petrified as a"
8897,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"reef, none the less perilous to all seafarers."
8898,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8899,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,A modern version of the fate of Glaucus and Scylla is given by Keats in
8900,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"the Endymion. Glaucus consents to Circe's blandishments for a season,"
8901,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"but becoming disgusted with her treachery and cruelty, he endeavors"
8902,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"to escape from her. The attempt proving unsuccessful, he is brought"
8903,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,back and sentenced to pass a thousand years in decrepitude and pain.
8904,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Consequently, returning to the sea, he there discovers the body of"
8905,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Scylla, whom the goddess has not transformed, but drowned, and learns"
8906,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,that if he passes his thousand years in collecting the bodies of
8907,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"drowned lovers, a youth beloved of the gods will, in time, appear and"
8908,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"help him. This prophecy is fulfilled by Endymion, who aids in restoring"
8909,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Glaucus to youth, and Scylla and the drowned lovers to life."
8910,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8911,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,=143. Nisus and Scylla.=[190] The daughter of Phorcys is frequently
8912,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"confounded with another Scylla, daughter of King Nisus of Megara."
8913,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Scylla of Megara betrayed her father to his enemy, Minos II of Crete,"
8914,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"with whom, although the kings were at war, she had fallen violently in"
8915,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"love. It seems that Nisus had on his head a purple lock of hair, upon"
8916,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,which depended his fortune and his life. This lock his daughter clipped
8917,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"and conveyed to Minos. But recoiling from the treacherous gift, that"
8918,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"king, after he had conquered Megara, bound Scylla to the rudder of"
8919,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,his ship and so dragged her through the waves toward Crete. The girl
8920,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"was ultimately transformed into the monster of the barking dogs, or,"
8921,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"according to another authority, into a bird continually the prey of the"
8922,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"sea eagle, whose form her father Nisus had assumed."
8923,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8924,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"=144. Leucothea.=[191] Another sea change was that of Ino, the daughter"
8925,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"of Cadmus and wife of Athamas, who, flying from her frantic husband,"
8926,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"sprang, with her child Melicertes in her arms, from a cliff into the"
8927,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"sea. The gods, out of compassion, made her a goddess of the sea under"
8928,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"the name of Leucothea, and her son a god under that of Palæmon. Both"
8929,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,were held powerful to save from shipwreck and were invoked by sailors.
8930,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,Palæmon was usually represented as riding on a dolphin. In his honor
8931,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,the Isthmian games were celebrated. By the Romans he was called
8932,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Portumnus, and had jurisdiction of ports and shores."
8933,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8934,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"=145. Proteus and Aristæus.=[192] Though Aristæus, the lover of"
8935,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Eurydice, was son of Apollo and guardian himself of herds and flocks,"
8936,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"protector of vine and olive, and keeper of bees, still he was son of"
8937,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Cyrene, a water-nymph, and his most interesting adventure brought him"
8938,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,into contact with another deity of the sea.
8939,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8940,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"His bees having perished, Aristæus resorted for aid to his mother. She,"
8941,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"surrounded by her maidens in the crystalline abode under her river,"
8942,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,overheard his complaints and ordered that he should be brought into her
8943,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"presence. The stream at her command opened itself and let him enter,"
8944,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,while it stood heaped like a mountain on either side. Cyrene and her
8945,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"nymphs, having poured out libations to Neptune, gave the youth to eat"
8946,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"and listened to his complaint, then informed him that an aged prophet"
8947,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"named Proteus, who dwelt in the sea and pastured the sea calves of"
8948,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Neptune, could explain the cause of the mortality among the bees and"
8949,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,how to remedy it; but that the wizard would have to be chained and
8950,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"compelled to answer, and that even when chained, he would try to escape"
8951,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"by assuming a series of dreadful forms. ""Still, thou hast but to keep"
8952,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"him fast bound,"" concluded Cyrene, ""and at last, when he finds his"
8953,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"arts of no avail, he will obey thy behest."" The nymph then sprinkled"
8954,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"her son with nectar, whereupon an unusual vigor filled his frame and"
8955,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,courage his heart.
8956,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,
8957,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Cyrene led her son to the prophet's cave, which was in the island of"
8958,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Pharos, or of Carpathos,[193] and concealed him. At noon issued Proteus"
8959,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"from the water, followed by his herd of sea calves, which spread"
8960,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"themselves along the shore. He, too, stretched himself on the floor of"
8961,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,the cave and went to sleep. Aristæus immediately clapped fetters on him
8962,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"and shouted at the top of his voice. Proteus, finding himself captured,"

8966,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"in response to the questioning of Aristæus, said: ""Thou receivest the"

8980,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,between Hercules and the river-god Acheloüs. The cause of the strife
8981,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"was Dejanira of Calydon, whom both heroes loved. Hercules boasted his"

8983,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"lord of the mightiest and most ancient river of Greece, insinuated"
8984,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,suspicions with regard to the value of Hercules' pretensions. Then
8985,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,began a mighty struggle. Finding he was no match for Hercules in
8986,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"the wrestler's art, Acheloüs glided away in the form of a serpent."
8987,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Hercules, remarking that it was the labor of his infancy to strangle"
8988,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"snakes,[196] clasped the neck of Acheloüs and choked him. Then"
8989,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"Acheloüs assumed the seeming of a bull. Whereupon Hercules, seizing"
8990,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,"him by the horns, dragged his head to the ground, overthrew him, and"
8991,MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS,rent one horn away. This trophy the Naiads consecrated and filled with

9576,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",while the queen wore his lion's skin. But during this period he
9577,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",contrived to engage in about as many adventures as would fill the life
9578,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",of an ordinary hero. He rescued Daphnis from Lityerses and threw the

9642,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",shepherd and to him was ascribed the invention of pastoral story and
9643,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","song. His father was Hermes (Mercury); his mother, a nymph who laid"
9644,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",him when an infant in a charming valley in a laurel grove from which
9645,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","he received his name,[222] and on account of which Apollo loved him"
9646,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",and endowed him with the gift of idyllic verse. He was brought up by
9647,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","nymphs and shepherds, and, avoiding the noisy haunts of men, he tended"
9648,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","his flocks on Mount Ætna, winter and summer. He loved a maiden named"
9649,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","Piplea, but she was borne away by robbers. He followed them to Phrygia,"
9650,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","and there found his sweetheart in the power of the king of that realm,"
9651,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",Lityerses. This Lityerses had a pleasant custom of making strangers try
9652,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","a contest with him in reaping corn. If he overcame them, he cut off"
9653,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","their heads in the evening and concealed their bodies in the sheaves,"
9654,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","singing a comfortable song meanwhile. In order to win back Piplea,"
9655,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",Daphnis entered upon the reaping contest with the king and made himself
9656,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","comfortable, too, by singing a harvest song meanwhile. But Lityerses"
9657,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","surpassed him at the work and was about to put him to death, singing"
9658,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","no doubt a comfortable song of the reaper, Death, meanwhile,--when"
9659,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",suddenly Hercules appeared upon the scene. He doesn't seem to have
9660,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",spent much time singing: he assured Daphnis of his head by cutting
9661,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",off that of the pleasant king; and then he threw the body into the
9662,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",river Mæander. Daphnis regained his Piplea and one would suppose that
9663,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","they lived happy ever after. Another story, unfortunately, relates"
9664,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",events in which Piplea's name does not occur. A Naiad fell in love with
9665,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","the handsome shepherd and made him promise eternal fidelity to her,"
9666,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",threatening him with blindness if he violated his vow. It was hard for
9667,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","poor Daphnis, for nearly every lass he met made love to him. At last a"
9668,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",princess intoxicated him and he forgot his vow. Immediately the Naiad
9669,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",showed the quality of her love by striking him blind. He consoled
9670,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",himself for a while by singing his songs and playing the flute as he
9671,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","wandered from place to place. Then weary, he called on his father for"
9672,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",aid. Mercury accordingly transported him to heaven and caused a well
9673,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",to gush forth on the spot from which he ascended. Here the Sicilians
9674,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",offered yearly sacrifice in his honor.

9729,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS","occasion, as they journeyed together, they came to a river across"
9730,"MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS, AND ITS CONNECTIONS",which the centaur Nessus carried travelers for a stated fee. Hercules

9925,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"descended from Æolus, whose father, Hellen, was the son of Deucalion"
9926,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"of Thessaly. Athamas had by his wife Nephele two children, Phrixus and"
9927,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Helle. After a time, growing indifferent to his wife, Athamas put her"
9928,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"away and took Ino, the daughter of Cadmus. The unfortunate sequel of"
9929,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,this second marriage we have already seen.[233]
9930,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
9931,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Nephele, apprehending danger to her children from the influence of"
9932,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"their stepmother, took measures to put them out of her reach. Mercury"
9933,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"gave her a ram with a golden fleece, on which she set the two children."
9934,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Vaulting into the air, the animal took his course to the east; but"
9935,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"when he was crossing the strait that divides Europe and Asia, the girl"
9936,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Helle fell from his back into the sea, which from her was afterward"
9937,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,called the Hellespont--now the Dardanelles. The ram safely landed the
9938,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"boy Phrixus in Colchis, where he was hospitably received by Æetes, the"
9939,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"king of that country. Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Jupiter, but the"
9940,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"fleece he gave to Æetes, who placed it in a consecrated grove under the"
9941,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,care of a sleepless dragon.[234]

9943,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"=164. The Quest of the Golden Fleece.=[235] Another realm in Thessaly,"
9944,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"near to that of Athamas, was ruled over by his nephew Æson. Æson,"
9945,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"although he had a son Jason, surrendered the crown to a half brother,"
9946,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Pelias,[236] on condition that he should hold it only during the"
9947,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"minority of the lad. This young Jason was, by the way, a second cousin"
9948,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"of Bellerophon and of the Atalanta who ran against Hippomenes, and a"
9949,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"first cousin of Admetus, the husband of Alcestis.[237] When, however,"
9950,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Jason, being grown up, came to demand the crown, his uncle Pelias"
9951,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,with wily intent suggested to him the glorious quest of the golden
9952,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"fleece. Jason, pleased with the thought, forthwith made preparations"
9953,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,for the expedition. At that time the only species of navigation known
9954,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,to the Greeks consisted of small boats or canoes hollowed out from
9955,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"trunks of trees; when, accordingly, Jason employed Argus to build a"
9956,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"vessel capable of containing fifty men, it was considered a gigantic"
9957,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"undertaking. The vessel was named _Argo_, probably after its builder."
9958,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Jason soon found himself at the head of a bold band of comrades, many"
9959,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,of whom afterward were renowned among the heroes and demigods of Greece.

9979,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Theseus, Meleager, Peleus, and Nestor were also among these Argonauts,"
9980,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,or sailors of the _Argo_. The ship with her crew of heroes left
9981,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"the shores of Thessaly, and touching at the island of Lemnos,"
9982,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,thence crossed to Mysia and thence to Thrace. Here they found the
9983,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"sage Phineus, who instructed the Argonauts how they might pass the"
9984,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Symplegades, or Clashing Islands, at the entrance of the Euxine Sea."
9985,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"When they reached these islands they, accordingly, let go a dove, which"
9986,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"took her way between the rocks and passed in safety, only losing some"
9987,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"feathers of her tail. Jason and his men, seizing the favorable moment"
9988,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"of the rebound, plied their oars with vigor and passed safe through,"
9989,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,though the islands closed behind them and actually grazed the stern of
9990,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,the vessel. They then rowed along the shore till they arrived at the
9991,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"eastern end of the sea, and so landed in the kingdom of Colchis."
9992,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
9993,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,[Illustration: FIG. 131. JASON CONQUERS THE BULLS AND STEALS THE FLEECE]
9994,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
9995,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Jason made known his message to the Colchian king, Æetes, who consented"
9996,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"to give up the golden fleece on certain conditions, namely, that Jason"
9997,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"should yoke to the plow two fire-breathing bulls with brazen feet,"
9998,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,and that he then should sow the teeth of the dragon that Cadmus had
9999,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"slain. Jason, although it was well known that a crop of armed men"
10000,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"would spring up from the teeth, destined to turn their weapons against"
10001,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"their producer, accepted the conditions, and a time was set for the"
10002,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"undertaking. The hero, however, wisely spent the interval in wooing"
10003,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Medea, the daughter of Æetes; and with such success that they plighted"
10004,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,troth before the altar of Hecate. The princess then furnished her hero
10005,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,with a charm which should aid him in the contest to come.
10006,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
10007,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Accordingly, when the momentous day was arrived, Jason with calmness"
10008,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,encountered the fire-breathing monsters and speedily yoked them to the
10009,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,plow. The Colchians stood in amazement; the Greeks shouted for joy.
10010,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Next, the hero proceeded to sow the dragon's teeth and plow them in."
10011,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Up sprang, according to prediction, the crop of armed men, brandished"
10012,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"aloft their weapons, and rushed upon Jason. The Greeks trembled for"
10013,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,their hero. Medea herself grew pale with fear. The hero himself for a
10014,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"time, with sword and shield, kept his assailants at bay; but he surely"
10015,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"would have been overwhelmed by the numbers, had he not resorted to"
10016,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"a charm which Medea had taught him: seizing a stone, he threw it in"
10017,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,the midst of his foes. Immediately they turned their arms against one
10018,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"another, and soon there was not one of the dragon's brood alive."
10019,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
10020,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,It remained only to lull to sleep the dragon that guarded the fleece.
10021,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,This was done by scattering over him a few drops of a preparation
10022,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"which, again, Medea had supplied. Jason then seized the fleece, and,"
10023,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"with his friends and his sweetheart accompanying, hastened to the"
10024,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"vessel. It is said that, in order to delay the pursuit of her father"
10025,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Æetes, Medea tore to pieces her young brother Absyrtus and strewed"
10026,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,fragments of him along the line of their flight. The ruse succeeded.

10029,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"beat a devious course, sailing after other dangers had been overcome,"
10030,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,by the island that the Sirens infested. And here the heroes would

10055,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Men's ears of this our victory,"

10061,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Alas! and will ye stop your ears,"
10062,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"In vain desire to do aught,"
10063,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"And wish to live 'mid cares and fears,"
10064,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,Until the last fear makes you nought?
10065,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,

10079,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"means, completed. At Jason's request she undertook next to restore his"
10080,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,aged father Æson to the vigor of youth. To the full moon she addressed
10081,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"her incantations, to the stars, to Hecate, to Tellus, the goddess of"
10082,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,the earth. In a chariot borne aloft by dragons she traversed the fields
10083,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"of air to regions where flourished potent plants, which only she knew"
10084,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"how to select. Nine nights she employed in her search, and during that"
10085,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,period shunned all intercourse with mortals.

10088,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
10089,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Next she erected two altars, the one to Hecate, the other to Hebe,"
10090,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"and sacrificed a black sheep,--pouring libations of milk and wine."
10091,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,She implored Pluto and his stolen bride to spare the old man's life.
10092,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,Then she directed that Æson be led forth; and throwing him into a deep
10093,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"sleep, she laid him on a bed of herbs, like one dead. No eye profane"
10094,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,looked upon her mysteries. With streaming hair thrice she moved round
10095,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"the altars, dipped flaming twigs in the blood, and laid them thereon"
10096,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"to burn. Meanwhile, the caldron with its contents was preparing. In"
10097,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"it she put magic herbs, with seeds and flowers of acrid juice, stones"
10098,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"from the distant East, and sand from the shore of all-surrounding"
10099,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"ocean, hoar-frost gathered by moonlight, a screech owl's head and"
10100,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"wings, and the entrails of a wolf. She added fragments of the shells"
10101,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,of tortoises and the liver of stags--animals tenacious of life--and
10102,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"the head and beak of a crow, which outlives nine generations of men."
10103,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"These, with many other things ""without a name,"" she boiled together for"
10104,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"her purposed work, stirring them with a dry olive branch. The branch,"
10105,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"when taken out, instantly was green and erelong was covered with leaves"
10106,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,and a plentiful growth of young olives; and as the liquor boiled and
10107,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"bubbled and sometimes bubbled over, the grass wherever the sprinklings"
10108,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,fell leaped into verdure like that of spring.
10109,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
10110,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Seeing that all was ready, Medea cut the throat of the old man, let"
10111,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"out his blood, and poured into his mouth and his wound the juices of"
10112,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"her caldron. As soon as he had completely imbibed them, his hair and"
10113,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,beard lost their whiteness and assumed the color of youth; his paleness
10114,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"and emaciation were gone; his veins were full of blood, his limbs of"
10115,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"vigor and robustness; and Æson, on awakening, found himself forty years"
10116,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,younger.

10120,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"=167. Pelias.=[241] In another instance, Medea made her arts the"
10121,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"instrument of revenge. Pelias, the usurping uncle of Jason, still kept"
10122,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,him out of his heritage. But the daughters of Pelias wished Medea
10123,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"to restore their father also to youth. Medea simulated consent, but"
10124,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,prepared her caldron for him in a new and singular way. She put in only
10125,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,water and a few simple herbs. In the night she persuaded the daughters
10126,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"of Pelias to kill him. They at first hesitated to strike, but Medea"
10127,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"chiding their irresolution, they turned away their faces and, giving"
10128,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"random blows, smote him with their weapons. Starting from his sleep,"
10129,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"the old man cried out, ""My daughters, would you kill your father?"""
10130,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"Whereat their hearts failed them, and the weapons fell from their"
10131,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"hands. Medea, however, struck the fatal blow."
10132,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,
10133,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"They placed him in the caldron, but, as might be expected, with no"
10134,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,success. Medea herself had taken care to escape before they discovered
10135,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"the treachery. She had, however, little profit of the fruits of her"
10136,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"crime. Jason, for whom she had sacrificed so much, put her away, for he"
10137,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"wished to marry Creüsa, princess of Corinth. Whereupon Medea, enraged"
10138,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"at his ingratitude, called on the gods for vengeance; then, sending a"
10139,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"poisoned robe as a gift to the bride, killing her own children, and"
10140,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"setting fire to the palace, she mounted her serpent-drawn chariot and"
10141,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,"fled to Athens. There she married King Ægeus, the father of Theseus;"
10142,THE FAMILY OF ÆOLUS,and we shall meet her again when we come to the adventures of that

10202,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"expedition had been Meleager, a son of [OE]neus and Althæa, rulers"
10203,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"of Calydon in Ætolia. His parents were cousins, descended from a son"
10204,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"of Endymion named Ætolus, who had colonized that realm. By ties of"
10205,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,kinship and marriage they were allied with many historic figures. Their
10206,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"daughter Dejanira had become, as we have already noted, the wife of"
10207,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Hercules; while Leda, the sister of Althæa, was mother of Castor and"
10208,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Pollux,[245] and of Clytemnestra and Helen, intimately concerned in the"
10209,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Trojan War.
10210,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10211,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"When her son Meleager was born, Althæa had beheld the three Destinies,"
10212,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"who, as they spun their fatal thread, foretold that the life of the"
10213,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,child should last no longer than a certain brand then burning upon the
10214,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"hearth. Althæa seized and quenched the brand, and carefully preserved"
10215,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"it while Meleager grew to boyhood, youth, and man's estate. It chanced,"
10216,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"then, that [OE]neus, offering sacrifices to the gods, omitted to pay"
10217,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"due honors to Diana; wherefore she, indignant at the neglect, sent a"
10218,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,boar of enormous size to lay waste the fields of Calydon. Meleager
10219,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,called on the heroes of Greece to join in a hunt for the ravenous
10220,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"monster. Theseus and his friend Pirithoüs,[246] Jason, Peleus the"
10221,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"father of Achilles, Telamon the father of Ajax, Nestor, then a youth,"
10222,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,but who in his age bore arms with Achilles and Ajax in the Trojan
10223,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"War,[247]--these and many more joined in the enterprise. With them"
10224,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"came, also, Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, of the race of Callisto,--"
10225,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10226,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Arcadian Atalanta, snowy-souled,"
10227,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Fair as the snow and footed as the wind.[248]
10228,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10229,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"A buckle of polished gold confined her vest, an ivory quiver hung on"
10230,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"her left shoulder, and her left hand bore the bow. Her face blended"
10231,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"feminine beauty with the graces of martial youth. Meleager saw and,"
10232,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"with chivalric reverence, somewhat thus addressed her:"
10233,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10234,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"For thy name's sake and awe toward thy chaste head,"
10235,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,O holiest Atalanta! no man dares
10236,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Praise thee, though fairer than whom all men praise,"
10237,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,And godlike for thy grace of hallowed hair
10238,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"And holy habit of thine eyes, and feet"
10239,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"That make the blown foam neither swift nor white,"
10240,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Though the wind winnow and whirl it; yet we praise
10241,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Gods, found because of thee adorable"
10242,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,And for thy sake praiseworthiest from all men:
10243,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Thee therefore we praise also, thee as these,"
10244,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Pure, and a light lit at the hands of gods.[249]"

10247,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10248,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,But there was no time then for love; on to the hunt they pushed. To
10249,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"the hunt went also Plexippus and Toxeus, brothers of Queen Althæa,"
10250,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"braggarts, envious of Meleager. Speedily the hunters drew near the"
10251,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,monster's lair. They stretched strong nets from tree to tree; they
10252,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,uncoupled their dogs; they sought the footprints of their quarry in the
10253,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"grass. From the wood was a descent to marshy ground. Here the boar, as"
10254,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"he lay among the reeds, heard the shouts of his pursuers and rushed"
10255,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"forth against them. One and another is thrown down and slain. Jason,"
10256,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Nestor, Telamon open the attack, but in vain."
10257,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10258,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"... Then all abode save one,"

10260,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Sprang her hounds, laboring at the leash, and slipped,"
10261,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,And plashed ear-deep with plunging feet; but she
10262,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Saying, ""Speed it as I send it for thy sake,"
10263,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Goddess,"" drew bow and loosed; the sudden string"
10264,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Rang, and sprang inward, and the waterish air"
10265,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Hissed, and the moist plumes of the songless reeds"
10266,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Moved as a wave which the wind moves no more.
10267,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"But the boar heaved half out of ooze and slime,"
10268,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"His tense flank trembling round the barbèd wound,"
10269,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Hateful; and fiery with invasive eyes,"
10270,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"And bristling with intolerable hair,"
10271,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Plunged, and the hounds clung, and green flowers and white"
10272,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Reddened and broke all round them where they came.[1]
10273,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10274,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"It was a slight wound, but Meleager saw and joyfully proclaimed it. The"
10275,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"attack was renewed. Peleus, Amphiaraüs, Theseus, Jason, hurled their"

10277,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10278,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Rock-rooted, fair with fierce and fastened lips,"
10279,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Clear eyes and springing muscle and shortening limb--
10280,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"With chin aslant indrawn to a tightening throat,"
10281,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Grave, and with gathered sinews, like a god,--"
10282,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Aimed on the left side his well-handled spear,"
10283,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Grasped where the ash was knottiest hewn, and smote,"
10284,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"And with no missile wound, the monstrous boar"
10285,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Right in the hairiest hollow of his hide,"
10286,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Under the last rib, sheer through bulk and bone,"
10287,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Deep in; and deeply smitten, and to death,"
10288,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,The heavy horror with his hanging shafts
10289,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Leapt, and fell furiously, and from raging lips"

10291,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10292,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Then rose a shout from those around; they glorified the
10293,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"conqueror,--crowded to touch his hand. But he, placing his foot upon"
10294,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"the head of the slain boar, turned to Atalanta, and bestowed on her"
10295,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,the head and the rough hide--trophies of his success. Thereat she
10296,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,laughed--
10297,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10298,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Lit with a low blush to the braided hair,"
10299,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"And rose-colored and cold like very dawn,"

10301,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"A faint grave laugh; and all they held their peace,"
10302,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"And she passed by them. Then one cried, ""Lo now,"

10305,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,And all they rode against her violently

10312,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Plexippus, crying out, ""This for love's sake, Sweet,"""
10313,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Drove at Meleager, who with spear straightening"
10314,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Pierced his cheek through; then Toxeus made for him,"
10315,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Dumb, but his spear shake; vain and violent words,"

10320,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10321,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Of this fearful sequel to the hunt, Althæa has heard nothing. As she"
10322,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"bears thank offering to the temples for the victory of her son, the"

10328,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,commands a fire to be prepared. Four times she essays to place the
10329,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"brand upon the pile; four times draws back, shuddering before the"

10336,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"those whom he loves, Atalanta and his mother. But speedily the brand"

10346,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Merope,[252] daughter of king Cypselus of Arcadia, and descended from"
10347,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Arcas, the son of Callisto and Jupiter. On account of her relationship"
10348,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"to Atalanta her story may be told here, though she is not a member of"
10349,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"the family of Ætolus. Her husband, Cresphontes the Heraclid, king of"
10350,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Messenia, had been slain with two of his sons by rebellious nobles;"
10351,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"and one Polyphontes, leader of the revolt, reigned in his stead and"
10352,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"took Merope to wife. But her third son by Cresphontes, Æpytus, had been"
10353,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"concealed by her in Arcadia. Thence, in due season, he returned unknown"
10354,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"to her, with the purpose of wreaking vengeance on the murderers of his"
10355,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"sire. He pretended to have slain Æpytus, and so as a stranger won the"
10356,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"favor of Polyphontes, but came near losing his life at his mother's"
10357,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"hands. A recognition being happily effected, Æpytus, aided by his"
10358,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"mother, put Polyphontes to death and took possession of the kingdom."
10359,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"This story has been frequently dramatized, first by Euripides in a"
10360,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"lost play called Cresphontes, and most recently by Matthew Arnold,"
10361,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,whose Merope is a masterpiece of classical invention and of poetic

10365,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Meleager, bore to Tyndareus, king of Sparta, Castor and Clytemnestra."
10366,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"To Jove she bore Pollux and Helen. Pollux and Castor--one, the son"
10367,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"of a god and immortal, the other, of mortal breed and destiny--are"
10368,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,famous for their fraternal affection. Endowed with various manly
10369,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"virtues,--Castor a horse-tamer, Pollux a boxer,--they made all"
10370,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,expeditions in common. Together they joined the Calydonian hunt.
10371,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Together they accompanied the Argonauts. During the voyage to Colchis
10372,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"it is said that, a storm arising, Orpheus prayed to the Samothracian"
10373,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"gods and played on his harp, and that when the storm ceased, stars"
10374,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,appeared on the heads of the brothers. Hence they came to be honored as
10375,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,patrons of voyagers.
10376,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10377,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"They rendered, indeed, noteworthy service to the Argonauts returning"
10378,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,from Colchis with Medea and the Golden Fleece. For when the voyagers
10379,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,attempted a landing at Crete they were confronted by the gigantic
10380,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"warder of the island. This was Talus, a form of living brass, fashioned"
10381,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"by Hephæstus (Vulcan) and presented to King Minos, about whose Cretan"
10382,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,domain he made his rounds three times a day. Ordinarily when Talus saw
10383,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,voyagers nearing the coast he fired himself red-hot and embraced them
10384,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,as they landed. For some reason he did not welcome the Argonauts in
10385,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"this warm fashion, but"
10386,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10387,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Whirling with resistless sway

10393,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Thrice, hellward bending, mutters charms in air;"

10401,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"only one vein, and that plugged on the crown of his head with a nail."
10402,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Medea drew out the stopper.
10403,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,
10404,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,At a later period when Theseus and his friend Pirithoüs had carried off
10405,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"Helen from Sparta, the youthful heroes, Castor and Pollux, with their"
10406,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"followers hasted to the rescue. Theseus being absent from Attica, the"
10407,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"brothers recovered their sister. Later still, we find Castor and Pollux"
10408,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"engaged in a combat with Idas and Lynceus of Messene, some say over the"
10409,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"daughters of Leucippus, others, over a herd of oxen. Castor was slain;"
10410,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"but Pollux, inconsolable for the loss of his brother, besought Jupiter"
10411,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,to be permitted to give his own life as a ransom for him. Jupiter so
10412,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,far consented as to allow the two brothers to enjoy the boon of life
10413,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"alternately, each spending one day under the earth and the next in the"
10414,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"heavenly abodes. According to another version, Jupiter rewarded the"
10415,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,"attachment of the brothers by placing them among the stars as Gemini,"
10416,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,the Twins. They received heroic honors as the _Tyndaridæ_ (sons of
10417,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,Tyndareus); divine honors they received under the name of _Dioscuri_
10418,THE FAMILY OF ÆTOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS,(sons of Jove).[254]

10547,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,=172. Minos of Crete= was a descendant of Inachus in the sixth
10548,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"generation. A son of Jupiter and Europa, he was, after death,"
10549,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"transferred, with his brother Rhadamanthus and with King Æacus, to"
10550,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"Hades, where the three became judges of the Shades. This is the Minos"
10551,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"mentioned by Homer and Hesiod,--the eminent lawgiver. Of his grandson,"
10552,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"Minos II, it is related that when aiming at the crown of Crete, he"
10553,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"boasted of his power to obtain by prayer whatever he desired, and as"
10554,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"a test, he implored Neptune to send him a bull for sacrifice. The"
10555,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"bull appeared, but Minos, astonished at its great beauty, declined"
10556,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"to sacrifice the brute. Neptune, therefore incensed, drove the bull"
10557,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"wild,--worse still, drove Pasiphaë, the wife of Minos, wild with"
10558,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,love of it. The wonderful brute was finally caught and overcome by
10559,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"Hercules, who rode it through the waves to Greece. But its offspring,"
10560,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"the Minotaur, a monster bull-headed and man-bodied, remained for many"
10561,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"a day a terror to Crete, till finally a famous artificer, Dædalus,"
10562,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"constructed for him a labyrinth, with passages and turnings winding"
10563,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"in and about like the river Mæander, so that whoever was inclosed in"
10564,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"it might by no means find his way out. The Minotaur, roaming therein,"
10565,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"lived upon human victims. For it is said that, after Minos had subdued"
10566,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"Megara,[256] a tribute of seven youths and seven maidens was sent every"
10567,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,year from Athens to Crete to feed this monster; and it was not until

10573,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"was imprisoned by him. Seeing no other way of escape, the artificer"
10574,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"made, out of feathers, wings for his son Icarus and himself, which he"
10575,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"fastened on with wax. Then poising themselves in the air, they flew"
10576,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"away. Icarus had been warned not to approach too near the sun, and"
10577,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,all went well till they had passed Samos and Delos on the left and
10578,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,"Lebynthos on the right. But then the boy, exulting in his career,"
10579,THE HOUSE OF MINOS,soared upward. The blaze of the torrid sun softened the waxen fastening

10702,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Ægeus, king of Athens. By Æthra, granddaughter of Pelops, he became"
10703,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"the father of the Attic hero, Theseus. Ægeus, on parting from Æthra,"
10704,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"before the birth of the child, had placed his sword and shoes under"
10705,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,a large stone and had directed her to send the child to him if it
10706,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,should prove strong enough to roll away the stone and take what was
10707,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"under. The lad Theseus was brought up at Tr[oe]zen, of which Pittheus,"
10708,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Æthra's father, was king. When Æthra thought the time had come, she"
10709,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,led Theseus to the stone. He removed it with ease and took the sword
10710,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"and shoes. Since at that time the roads were infested with robbers,"
10711,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,his grandfather Pittheus pressed him earnestly to take the shorter and
10712,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"safer way to his father's country, by sea; but the youth, feeling in"
10713,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,himself the spirit and soul of a hero and eager to signalize himself

10726,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"important was his slaughter of Procrustes, or the Stretcher. This giant"
10727,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,had an iron bedstead on which he used to tie all travelers who fell
10728,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"into his hands. If they were shorter than the bed, he stretched them"
10729,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"till they fitted it; if they were longer than the bed, he lopped off"

10732,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"In the course of time Theseus reached Athens, but here new dangers"

10734,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"her separation from Jason,[265] had become the wife of Ægeus. Knowing"
10735,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"by her arts who the stranger was, and fearing the loss of her influence"
10736,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"with her husband if Theseus should be acknowledged as his son, she"
10737,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,tried to poison the youth; but the sword which he wore discovered him

10739,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,the country afterwards called Media is said to have received its name
10740,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,from her. Theseus was acknowledged by his sire and declared successor

10750,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,against the Marathonian bull and so had brought about the young man's

10752,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,
10753,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,From this calamity Theseus resolved to deliver his countrymen or to

10949,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,undertook an expedition against the Amazons. Assailing them before they
10950,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"had recovered from the attack of Hercules, he carried off their queen"
10951,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Antiope; but they in turn, invading the country of Athens, penetrated"

10956,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Pirithoüs of Thessaly, son of Jupiter, originated in the midst of"
10957,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,arms. Pirithoüs had made an irruption into the plain of Marathon and
10958,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,had carried off the herds of the king of Athens. Theseus went to repel
10959,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"the plunderers. The moment the Thessalian beheld him, he was seized"
10960,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"with admiration, and stretching out his hand as a token of peace, he"
10961,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"cried, ""Be judge thyself,--what satisfaction dost thou require?""--""Thy"

10963,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Their deeds corresponding to their professions, they continued true"

10966,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,ensued between the Lapithæ (of whom Pirithoüs was king) and the
10967,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Centaurs. For it happened that at the marriage feast, the Centaurs were"
10968,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"among the guests; and one of them, Eurytion, becoming intoxicated,"
10969,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,attempted to offer violence to the bride. Other Centaurs followed his
10970,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"example; combat was joined; Theseus leaped into the fray, and not a few"
10971,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,of the guests bit the dust.

10976,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Theseus fixed his choice on Leda's daughter Helen, then a child, but"
10977,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,afterwards famous as the cause of the Trojan War; and with the aid of
10978,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"his friend he carried her off, only, however, to restore her at very"
10979,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"short notice. As for Pirithoüs, he aspired to the wife of the monarch"
10980,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"of Erebus; and Theseus, though aware of the danger, accompanied the"
10981,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,ambitious lover to the underworld. But Pluto seized and set them on
10982,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"an enchanted rock at his palace gate, where fixed they remained till"
10983,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Hercules, arriving, liberated Theseus but left Pirithoüs to his fate."

10986,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"married Phædra, sister of the deserted Ariadne, daughter of Minos. But"
10987,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"Phædra, seeing in Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, a youth endowed with"
10988,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,all the graces and virtues of his father and of an age corresponding
10989,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"to her own, loved him. When, however, he repulsed her advances, her"
10990,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"love was changed to despair and hate. Hanging herself, she left for"
10991,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,her husband a scroll containing false charges against Hippolytus.
10992,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"The infatuated husband, filled, therefore, with jealousy of his son,"
10993,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,imprecated the vengeance of Neptune upon him. As Hippolytus one day
10994,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"drove his chariot along the shore, a sea monster raised himself above"
10995,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,the waters and frightened the horses so that they ran away and dashed
10996,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"the chariot to pieces. Hippolytus was killed, but by Æsculapius was"
10997,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"restored to life, and then, removed by Diana from the power of his"
10998,THE HOUSE OF CECROPS AND ERICHTHONIUS,"deluded father, was placed in Italy under the protection of the nymph"

11042,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"daughters, Semele, Ino, Autonoë, Agave,--his grandsons, Melicertes,"
11043,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"Actæon, Pentheus,--lived sorrowful lives or suffered violent deaths."
11044,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"The misfortunes of one branch of his family, sprung from his son"
11045,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"Polydorus, remain to be told. The curse seems to have spared Polydorus"
11046,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"himself. His son Labdacus, also, lived a quiet life as king of Thebes"
11047,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"and left a son, Laïus, upon the throne. But erelong Laïus was warned"
11048,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"by an oracle that there was danger to his throne and life if his son,"
11049,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"new-born, should reach man's estate. He, therefore, committed the child"

11059,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"Many years afterward, [OE]dipus, learning from an oracle that he was"
11060,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"destined to be the death of his father, left the realm of his reputed"

11062,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"to Delphi, accompanied only by one attendant. In a narrow road he"

11070,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,She was called the Sphinx. She had the body of a lion and the upper
11071,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"part of a woman. She lay crouched on the top of a rock and, arresting"

11075,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"[OE]dipus, not daunted by these alarming accounts, boldly advanced to"

11078,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"[OE]dipus replied, ""Man, who in childhood creeps on hands and knees, in"

11086,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,slayer of his father; in marrying the queen he became the husband

11088,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"years, Thebes being afflicted with famine and pestilence, the oracle"
11089,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"was consulted, and, by a series of coincidences, the double crime of"
11090,THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS,"[OE]dipus came to light. At once, Jocasta put an end to her life by"

11327,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,
11328,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,=191. Peleus=[277] was the son of Æacus and grandson of Jove. It was
11329,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"for his father Æacus, king of Phthia in Thessaly, that, as we have"
11330,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"seen, an army of Myrmidons was created by Jupiter. Peleus joined the"
11331,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"expedition of the Argonauts, and on that journey beheld and fell in"
11332,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"love with the sea-nymph Thetis, daughter of Nereus and Doris. Such"
11333,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,was the beauty of the nymph that Jupiter himself had sought her in
11334,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"marriage; but having learned from Prometheus, the Titan, that Thetis"
11335,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"should bear a son who should be greater than his father, the Olympian"
11336,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,desisted from his suit and decreed that Thetis should be the wife
11337,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"of a mortal. By the aid of Chiron, the Centaur, Peleus succeeded in"
11338,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"winning the goddess for his bride. In this marriage, to be productive"
11339,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"of momentous results for mortals, the immortals manifested a lively"
11340,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,interest. They thronged with the Thessalians to the wedding in
11341,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"Pharsalia; they honored the wedding feast with their presence and,"

11371,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"the good falleth good; to the evil, evil speedily. Therefore, the"
11372,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"story of Theseus and Ariadne, which has already been recounted, was"
11373,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"here displayed in cunning handiwork. For Theseus, the false lover,"
11374,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"bold of hand but bad of heart, gained by retributive justice undying"

11542,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"Of the families of Peleus, Atreus, and Tyndareus, the genealogies will"
11543,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,be found in the Commentary corresponding with these sections of the
11544,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"story; also the genealogy of Ulysses, one of the leaders of the Greek"
11545,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"army during the war and the hero of the Odyssey, which narrates his"
11546,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,subsequent adventures; and that of the royal family of Troy against
11547,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,whom the war was undertaken. A slight study of these family trees will
11548,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,reveal interesting relationships between the principal participants in
11549,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,the war. For instance: that the passionate Achilles and the intolerant
11550,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"Ajax, second only to Achilles in military prowess, are first cousins;"
11551,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,and that the family of Ajax is connected by marriage with that of the
11552,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"Trojan Hector, whom he meets in combat. That Ulysses is a distant"
11553,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"cousin of his wife Penelope and of Clytemnestra, the wife of Agamemnon;"
11554,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"and that he is a kinsman of Patroclus, the bosom friend of Achilles. In"
11555,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,the family of Tyndareus we note most the tragic and romantic careers
11556,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"of the women,--Clytemnestra, who murdered her husband and married"
11557,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"his cousin Ægisthus; Helen, whose beauty provoked war between her"
11558,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"two husbands and their races; Penelope, whose fidelity to her absent"
11559,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"lord is the marvel of the Odyssey. It will be noticed, too, that the"
11560,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"daughter of Helen, Hermione, is strangely enough married first by"
11561,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"the son of Achilles and, afterwards, by the son of Agamemnon, and so"
11562,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"becomes sister-in-law to her noble cousins, Electra and Iphigenia."

11564,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"The kinsmen and descendants of Peleus--Telamon, Ajax, Teucer, Achilles,"
11565,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"Neoptolemus--are characterized by their personal valor, their"
11566,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"intolerant and resentful temper. In the family of Atreus, the men are"
11567,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,remarkable for their kingly attributes; the principal women for their
11568,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,unwavering devotion to religious duty. The members of the royal family
11569,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,of Troy are of richly varied and most unusual individuality: like
11570,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"Tithonus and Memnon, Paris, Hesione, Cassandra and Polyxena, poetic"
11571,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"and pathetic; like Laomedon, Priam, Hector and Troilus, patriotic,"
11572,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,persistent in the face of overwhelming odds; but all fated to a
11573,HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR,"dolorous end. Of those engaged in the Trojan War, Æneas and his aged"

11617,THE TROJAN WAR,"sent the goddesses to Mount Ida where Paris, son of Priam, king of"
11618,THE TROJAN WAR,"Troy, was tending his flocks. Till that moment the shepherd-prince had"

11644,THE TROJAN WAR,"he owed fealty, decided in favor of Venus, thus making the two other"

11648,THE TROJAN WAR,the prize destined for Paris. This fair queen had in time past been

11650,THE TROJAN WAR,"they all, at the suggestion of Ulysses, son of Laërtes, king of Ithaca,"
11651,THE TROJAN WAR,had taken an oath that they would sustain her choice and avenge her
11652,THE TROJAN WAR,"cause if necessary. She was living happily with Menelaüs when Paris,"
11653,THE TROJAN WAR,"becoming their guest, made love to her, and then, aided by Venus,"
11654,THE TROJAN WAR,"persuaded her to elope with him, and carried her to Troy. From this"
11655,THE TROJAN WAR,"cause arose the famous Trojan War,--the theme of the greatest poems of"
11656,THE TROJAN WAR,"antiquity, those of Homer and Virgil."
11657,THE TROJAN WAR,
11658,THE TROJAN WAR,[Illustration: FIG. 151. ACHILLES TAKEN FROM SCYROS]
11659,THE TROJAN WAR,
11660,THE TROJAN WAR,Menelaüs called upon the chieftains of Greece to aid him in recovering
11661,THE TROJAN WAR,"his wife. They came forward with a few exceptions. Ulysses, for"
11662,THE TROJAN WAR,"instance, who had married a cousin of Helen's, Penelope, daughter of"
11663,THE TROJAN WAR,"Icarius, was happy in his wife and child, and loth to embark in the"
11664,THE TROJAN WAR,troublesome affair. Palamedes was sent to urge him. But when Palamedes
11665,THE TROJAN WAR,"arrived at Ithaca, Ulysses pretended madness. He yoked an ass and an ox"
11666,THE TROJAN WAR,"together to the plow and began to sow salt. The ambassador, to try him,"
11667,THE TROJAN WAR,"placed the infant Telemachus before the plow, whereupon the father,"
11668,THE TROJAN WAR,"turning the plow aside, showed that his insanity was a mere pretense."
11669,THE TROJAN WAR,"Being himself gained for the undertaking, Ulysses lent his aid to bring"
11670,THE TROJAN WAR,"in other reluctant chiefs, especially Achilles, son of Peleus and"
11671,THE TROJAN WAR,"Thetis. Thetis being herself one of the immortals, and knowing that"
11672,THE TROJAN WAR,"her son was fated to perish before Troy if he went on the expedition,"
11673,THE TROJAN WAR,"endeavored to prevent his going. She, accordingly, sent him to the"
11674,THE TROJAN WAR,"court of King Lycomedes of the island of Scyros, and induced him to"
11675,THE TROJAN WAR,conceal himself in the garb of a maiden among the daughters of the
11676,THE TROJAN WAR,"king. Hearing that the young Achilles was there, Ulysses went disguised"
11677,THE TROJAN WAR,"as a merchant to the palace and offered for sale female ornaments,"
11678,THE TROJAN WAR,among which had been placed some arms. Forgetting the part he had
11679,THE TROJAN WAR,"assumed, Achilles handled the weapons and thereby betrayed himself to"
11680,THE TROJAN WAR,"Ulysses, who found no great difficulty in persuading him to disregard"
11681,THE TROJAN WAR,his mother's counsels and join his countrymen in the war.
11682,THE TROJAN WAR,
11683,THE TROJAN WAR,"It seems that from early youth Paris had been reared in obscurity,"
11684,THE TROJAN WAR,because there were forebodings that he would be the ruin of the state.
11685,THE TROJAN WAR,"These forebodings appeared, at last, likely to be realized; for the"
11686,THE TROJAN WAR,Grecian armament now in preparation was the greatest that had ever
11687,THE TROJAN WAR,"been fitted out. Agamemnon, king of Mycenæ and brother of Menelaüs,"
11688,THE TROJAN WAR,was chosen commander in chief. Preëminent among the warriors was
11689,THE TROJAN WAR,"the swift-footed Achilles. After him ranked his cousin Ajax, the"
11690,THE TROJAN WAR,"son of Telamon, gigantic in size and of great courage, but dull of"
11691,THE TROJAN WAR,"intellect; Diomede, the son of Tydeus, second only to Achilles in all"
11692,THE TROJAN WAR,"the qualities of a hero; Ulysses, famous for sagacity; and Nestor, the"
11693,THE TROJAN WAR,"oldest of the Grecian chiefs, to whom they all looked up for counsel."
11694,THE TROJAN WAR,
11695,THE TROJAN WAR,"But Troy was no feeble enemy. Priam the king, son of Laomedon and"
11696,THE TROJAN WAR,"brother of Tithonus and Hesione, was now old; but he had been a wise"
11697,THE TROJAN WAR,prince and had strengthened his state by good government at home and
11698,THE TROJAN WAR,powerful alliances with his neighbors. By his wife Hecuba he had a
11699,THE TROJAN WAR,numerous family; but the principal stay and support of his throne was
11700,THE TROJAN WAR,"his son Hector, one of the noblest figures of antiquity. The latter"
11701,THE TROJAN WAR,"had, from the first, a presentiment of the ruin of Troy, but still"
11702,THE TROJAN WAR,"he persevered in heroic resistance, though he by no means justified"
11703,THE TROJAN WAR,the wrong which brought this danger upon his country. He was united
11704,THE TROJAN WAR,"in marriage with the noble Andromache, and as husband and father his"
11705,THE TROJAN WAR,character was not less admirable than as warrior. The principal leaders
11706,THE TROJAN WAR,"on the side of the Trojans, beside Hector, were his relative, Æneas,"
11707,THE TROJAN WAR,"the son of Venus and Anchises, Deiphobus, Glaucus, and Sarpedon."
11708,THE TROJAN WAR,
11709,THE TROJAN WAR,"=196. Iphigenia in Aulis.= After two years of preparation, the Greek"
11710,THE TROJAN WAR,fleet and army assembled in the port of Aulis in B[oe]otia. Here
11711,THE TROJAN WAR,"Agamemnon, while hunting, killed a stag that was sacred to Diana. The"
11712,THE TROJAN WAR,goddess in retribution visited the army with pestilence and produced
11713,THE TROJAN WAR,"a calm which prevented the ships from leaving the port. Thereupon,"
11714,THE TROJAN WAR,Calchas the soothsayer announced that the wrath of the virgin goddess
11715,THE TROJAN WAR,"could only be appeased by the sacrifice of a virgin, and that none"
11716,THE TROJAN WAR,"other but the daughter of the offender would be acceptable. Agamemnon,"
11717,THE TROJAN WAR,"however reluctant, submitted to the inevitable and sent for his"
11718,THE TROJAN WAR,"daughter Iphigenia, under the pretense that her marriage to Achilles"
11719,THE TROJAN WAR,"was to be at once performed. But, in the moment of sacrifice, Diana,"
11720,THE TROJAN WAR,"relenting, snatched the maiden away and left a hind in her place."
11721,THE TROJAN WAR,"Iphigenia, enveloped in a cloud, was conveyed to Tauris, where Diana"
11722,THE TROJAN WAR,made her priestess of her temple.[282]
11723,THE TROJAN WAR,
11724,THE TROJAN WAR,[Illustration: FIG. 152. THE SACRIFICE OF IPHIGENIA]
11725,THE TROJAN WAR,
11726,THE TROJAN WAR,Iphigenia is represented as thus describing her feelings at the moment
11727,THE TROJAN WAR,of sacrifice:
11728,THE TROJAN WAR,
11729,THE TROJAN WAR,"""I was cut off from hope in that sad place,"
11730,THE TROJAN WAR,Which men call'd Aulis in those iron years:
11731,THE TROJAN WAR,My father held his hand upon his face;
11732,THE TROJAN WAR,"I, blinded with my tears,"
11733,THE TROJAN WAR,
11734,THE TROJAN WAR,"""Still strove to speak: my voice was thick with sighs"
11735,THE TROJAN WAR,As in a dream. Dimly I could descry
11736,THE TROJAN WAR,"The stern black-bearded kings, with wolfish eyes"
11737,THE TROJAN WAR,Waiting to see me die.
11738,THE TROJAN WAR,
11739,THE TROJAN WAR,"""The high masts flicker'd as they lay afloat;"
11740,THE TROJAN WAR,"The crowds, the temples, waver'd, and the shore;"
11741,THE TROJAN WAR,The bright death quiver'd at the victim's throat;
11742,THE TROJAN WAR,"Touch'd; and I knew no more.""[283]"
11743,THE TROJAN WAR,
11744,THE TROJAN WAR,"=197. Protesilaüs and Laodamia.= The wind now proving fair, the fleet"
11745,THE TROJAN WAR,made sail and brought the forces to the coast of Troy. The Trojans
11746,THE TROJAN WAR,"opposed their landing, and at the first onset one of the noblest of"
11747,THE TROJAN WAR,"the Greeks, Protesilaüs, fell by the hand of Hector. This Protesilaüs"
11748,THE TROJAN WAR,"had left at home his wife Laodamia (a niece of Alcestis),--who was"
11749,THE TROJAN WAR,most tenderly attached to him. The story runs that when the news of
11750,THE TROJAN WAR,"his death reached her, she implored the gods for leave to converse"
11751,THE TROJAN WAR,with him if but for three hours. The request was granted. Mercury led
11752,THE TROJAN WAR,Protesilaüs back to the upper world; and when the hero died a second
11753,THE TROJAN WAR,time Laodamia died with him. It is said that the nymphs planted elm
11754,THE TROJAN WAR,"trees round his grave, which flourished till they were high enough"
11755,THE TROJAN WAR,"to command a view of Troy, then withered away, giving place to fresh"
11756,THE TROJAN WAR,branches that sprang from the roots.
11757,THE TROJAN WAR,
11758,THE TROJAN WAR,Wordsworth has taken the story of Protesilaüs and Laodamia for a poem
11759,THE TROJAN WAR,"invested with the atmosphere of the classics. The oracle, according"
11760,THE TROJAN WAR,"to the tradition, had declared that victory should be the lot of that"
11761,THE TROJAN WAR,party from which should fall the first victim in the war. The poet
11762,THE TROJAN WAR,"represents Protesilaüs, on his brief return to earth, relating to"
11763,THE TROJAN WAR,Laodamia the story of his fate:
11764,THE TROJAN WAR,
11765,THE TROJAN WAR,"""The wished-for wind was given:--I then revolved"
11766,THE TROJAN WAR,"The oracle, upon the silent sea;"
11767,THE TROJAN WAR,"And, if no worthier led the way, resolved"
11768,THE TROJAN WAR,"That, of a thousand vessels, mine should be"
11769,THE TROJAN WAR,"The foremost prow in pressing to the strand,--"
11770,THE TROJAN WAR,Mine the first blood that tinged the Trojan sand.
11771,THE TROJAN WAR,
11772,THE TROJAN WAR,"""Yet bitter, ofttimes bitter, was the pang"
11773,THE TROJAN WAR,"When of thy loss I thought, belovèd Wife!"
11774,THE TROJAN WAR,"On thee too fondly did my memory hang,"
11775,THE TROJAN WAR,"And on the joys we shared in mortal life,--"
11776,THE TROJAN WAR,"The paths which we had trod--these fountains, flowers,"
11777,THE TROJAN WAR,"My new-planned cities, and unfinished towers."
11778,THE TROJAN WAR,
11779,THE TROJAN WAR,"""But should suspense permit the foe to cry,"
11780,THE TROJAN WAR,"'Behold they tremble!--haughty their array,"
11781,THE TROJAN WAR,Yet of their number no one dares to die'?
11782,THE TROJAN WAR,In soul I swept the indignity away:
11783,THE TROJAN WAR,"Old frailties then recurred:--but lofty thought,"
11784,THE TROJAN WAR,"In act embodied, my deliverance wrought.""..."
11785,THE TROJAN WAR,
11786,THE TROJAN WAR,... Upon the side
11787,THE TROJAN WAR,Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained)
11788,THE TROJAN WAR,A knot of spiry trees for ages grew
11789,THE TROJAN WAR,From out the tomb of him for whom she died;
11790,THE TROJAN WAR,"And ever, when such stature they had gained"
11791,THE TROJAN WAR,"That Ilium's walls were subject to their view,"
11792,THE TROJAN WAR,The trees' tall summits withered at the sight;
11793,THE TROJAN WAR,A constant interchange of growth and blight!
11794,THE TROJAN WAR,
11795,THE TROJAN WAR,=198. Homer's Iliad.= The war continued without decisive result for
11796,THE TROJAN WAR,nine years. Then an event occurred which seemed likely to prove fatal
11797,THE TROJAN WAR,"to the cause of the Greeks,--a quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon."
11798,THE TROJAN WAR,"It is at this point that the great poem of Homer, the Iliad, begins."
11799,THE TROJAN WAR,
11800,THE TROJAN WAR,Of this and the other epics from which the story is drawn an account
11801,THE TROJAN WAR,will be found in Chapter XXXII below; and a list of the best English
11802,THE TROJAN WAR,"translations, in the corresponding sections of the Commentary. What"
11803,THE TROJAN WAR,delight one may derive from reading the Greek epics even in translation
11804,THE TROJAN WAR,"is nowhere better expressed than in the following sonnet of John Keats,"
11805,THE TROJAN WAR,"""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer"":"
11806,THE TROJAN WAR,
11807,THE TROJAN WAR,"Much have I travel'd in the realms of gold,"
11808,THE TROJAN WAR,And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
11809,THE TROJAN WAR,Round many western islands have I been
11810,THE TROJAN WAR,Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
11811,THE TROJAN WAR,Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
11812,THE TROJAN WAR,That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne:
11813,THE TROJAN WAR,Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
11814,THE TROJAN WAR,Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
11815,THE TROJAN WAR,--Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
11816,THE TROJAN WAR,When a new planet swims into his ken;
11817,THE TROJAN WAR,Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
11818,THE TROJAN WAR,He stared at the Pacific--and all his men
11819,THE TROJAN WAR,Look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
11820,THE TROJAN WAR,"Silent, upon a peak in Darien."
11821,THE TROJAN WAR,
11822,THE TROJAN WAR,"=199. The Wrath of Achilles.= The Greeks, though unsuccessful against"
11823,THE TROJAN WAR,"Troy, had taken the neighboring and allied cities; and in the division"
11824,THE TROJAN WAR,"of the spoil a female captive, by name Chryseïs, daughter of Chryses,"
11825,THE TROJAN WAR,"priest of Apollo, had fallen to the share of Agamemnon. Chryses came"
11826,THE TROJAN WAR,bearing the sacred emblems of his office and begged the release of
11827,THE TROJAN WAR,his daughter. Agamemnon refused. Thereupon Chryses implored Apollo to
11828,THE TROJAN WAR,afflict the Greeks till they should be forced to yield their prey.
11829,THE TROJAN WAR,Apollo granted the prayer of his priest and sent such pestilence upon
11830,THE TROJAN WAR,"the Grecian camp, that a council was called to deliberate how to allay"
11831,THE TROJAN WAR,the wrath of the gods and avert the plague. Achilles boldly charged
11832,THE TROJAN WAR,the misfortunes upon Agamemnon as caused by his withholding Chryseïs.
11833,THE TROJAN WAR,"Agamemnon, in anger, consented, thereupon, to relinquish his captive,"
11834,THE TROJAN WAR,"but demanded that Achilles should yield to him in her stead Briseïs,"
11835,THE TROJAN WAR,a maiden who had fallen to that hero's share in the division of the
11836,THE TROJAN WAR,"spoil. Achilles submitted, but declared that he would take no further"
11837,THE TROJAN WAR,"part in the war,--withdrew his forces from the general camp and avowed"
11838,THE TROJAN WAR,his intention of returning to Greece.
11839,THE TROJAN WAR,

11842,THE TROJAN WAR,
11843,THE TROJAN WAR,=200. The Enlistment of the Gods.= The gods and goddesses interested
11844,THE TROJAN WAR,themselves as much in this famous siege as did the parties themselves.
11845,THE TROJAN WAR,"It was well known in heaven that fate had decreed the fall of Troy, if"
11846,THE TROJAN WAR,her enemies only persevered. Yet there was room for chance sufficient
11847,THE TROJAN WAR,to excite by turns the hopes and fears of the powers above who took
11848,THE TROJAN WAR,"part with either side. Juno and Minerva, in consequence of the slight"
11849,THE TROJAN WAR,"put upon their charms by Paris, were hostile to the Trojans; Venus"
11850,THE TROJAN WAR,"for the opposite cause favored them; she enlisted, also, her admirer"
11851,THE TROJAN WAR,"Mars on the same side. Neptune favored the Greeks. Apollo was neutral,"
11852,THE TROJAN WAR,"sometimes taking one side, sometimes the other. Jove himself, though he"
11853,THE TROJAN WAR,"loved Priam, exercised a degree of impartiality,--not, however, without"
11854,THE TROJAN WAR,exceptions.
11855,THE TROJAN WAR,
11856,THE TROJAN WAR,=201. Thetis intercedes for Achilles.= Resenting the injury done by
11857,THE TROJAN WAR,"Agamemnon to her son, Thetis, the silver-footed, repaired to Jove's"
11858,THE TROJAN WAR,"palace, and besought him to grant success to the Trojan arms and so"
11859,THE TROJAN WAR,make the Greeks repent of their injustice to Achilles. The father of
11860,THE TROJAN WAR,"the gods, wavering at first, finally sighed and consented, saying, ""Go"
11861,THE TROJAN WAR,"thou now, but look to it that Juno see thee not, for oft she taunts me"
11862,THE TROJAN WAR,"that I aid the Trojan cause."" Vain precaution: the jealous queen had"
11863,THE TROJAN WAR,"seen only too well, and quickly she confronted the Thunderer with her"
11864,THE TROJAN WAR,"suspicions,--"
11865,THE TROJAN WAR,
11866,THE TROJAN WAR,"""Fateful favor to Achilles, hast thou granted now I trow!"""
11867,THE TROJAN WAR,
11868,THE TROJAN WAR,said she.
11869,THE TROJAN WAR,
11870,THE TROJAN WAR,"Zeus that rolls the clouds of heaven, her addressing answered then:"
11871,THE TROJAN WAR,"""Moonstruck! thou art ever _trowing_; never I escape thy ken."
11872,THE TROJAN WAR,"After all, it boots thee nothing; leaves thee of my heart the less,--"
11873,THE TROJAN WAR,So thou hast the worser bargain. What if I the fact confess?
11874,THE TROJAN WAR,"It was done because I willed it. Hold thy place--my word obey,"
11875,THE TROJAN WAR,"Lest if I come near, and on thee these unconquered hands I lay,"
11876,THE TROJAN WAR,"All the gods that hold Olympus naught avail thee here to-day.""[284]"
11877,THE TROJAN WAR,
11878,THE TROJAN WAR,=202. Agamemnon calls a Council.= In the events which immediately
11879,THE TROJAN WAR,follow we are introduced to the more important human personages on
11880,THE TROJAN WAR,"both sides. To begin with, Agamemnon, king of men, deceived by a dream"
11881,THE TROJAN WAR,"sent by Jupiter, calls a council of the Greeks in which, desiring"
11882,THE TROJAN WAR,"to arouse them to fresh onslaught upon the Trojans, he tests their"
11883,THE TROJAN WAR,"patience first by depicting the joys of the return home to Greece, and"
11884,THE TROJAN WAR,nearly overreaches himself in his cunning; for had it not been for the
11885,THE TROJAN WAR,"wise Nestor, king of sandy Pylos, and Ulysses of many devices, peer of"
11886,THE TROJAN WAR,"Jove in wisdom, the common soldiers, fired with hope of viewing their"
11887,THE TROJAN WAR,"dear native land and wives and little children once more, would have"
11888,THE TROJAN WAR,launched the ships and sailed forthwith. Among the murmuring host of
11889,THE TROJAN WAR,"those who clamor for retreat the leader is Thersites, uncontrolled of"
11890,THE TROJAN WAR,"speech, full of disorderly words, striving idly against the chieftains,"
11891,THE TROJAN WAR,aiming ever to turn their authority into ridicule. He is the one
11892,THE TROJAN WAR,"ludicrous character of the Iliad, this boaster and scandalmonger,"
11893,THE TROJAN WAR,sneering and turbulent of tongue:
11894,THE TROJAN WAR,
11895,THE TROJAN WAR,His figure such as might his soul proclaim;
11896,THE TROJAN WAR,"One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame;"
11897,THE TROJAN WAR,"His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,"
11898,THE TROJAN WAR,Thin hairs bestrewed his long misshapen head.
11899,THE TROJAN WAR,"Spleen to mankind his envious heart possest,"
11900,THE TROJAN WAR,"And much he hated all, but most the best."
11901,THE TROJAN WAR,Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;
11902,THE TROJAN WAR,But royal scandal his delight supreme.[1]
11903,THE TROJAN WAR,
11904,THE TROJAN WAR,"Him Ulysses hearing rebukes, raising his scepter to strike:"
11905,THE TROJAN WAR,
11906,THE TROJAN WAR,"""Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,"
11907,THE TROJAN WAR,With wrangling talents formed for foul debate....
11908,THE TROJAN WAR,"Have we not known thee, slave of all our host,"
11909,THE TROJAN WAR,"The man who acts the least, upbraids the most?..."""
11910,THE TROJAN WAR,"He said, and cowering as the dastard bends,"
11911,THE TROJAN WAR,The weighty scepter on his back descends:
11912,THE TROJAN WAR,On the round bunch the bloody tumors rise;
11913,THE TROJAN WAR,The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes:
11914,THE TROJAN WAR,"Trembling he sat, and, shrunk in abject fears,"
11915,THE TROJAN WAR,From his wild visage wiped the scalding tears.[285]
11916,THE TROJAN WAR,
11917,THE TROJAN WAR,The revolt is thus stayed. A banquet of the Greek chieftains is then
11918,THE TROJAN WAR,"held, merely of the greatest--Nestor, Idomeneus of Crete, Ajax the son"
11919,THE TROJAN WAR,"of Telamon and cousin of Achilles, and Ajax the less, son of Oïleus,"
11920,THE TROJAN WAR,"Ulysses, also, and Agamemnon himself. Menelaüs comes, unbid but not"
11921,THE TROJAN WAR,"unwelcome. Sacrifices are offered, but in vain; Jove heeds them not."
11922,THE TROJAN WAR,"Finally, a muster of the Greek troops, by nations and by kings, is"
11923,THE TROJAN WAR,determined upon; and so the army is set in array.
11924,THE TROJAN WAR,
11925,THE TROJAN WAR,=203. Paris plays the Champion.= Likewise the army of the Trojans; and
11926,THE TROJAN WAR,battle is about to be joined when forth from the Trojan ranks steps
11927,THE TROJAN WAR,Paris himself to challenge some champion of the opposing host to single
11928,THE TROJAN WAR,"combat,--the beauteous Paris,"
11929,THE TROJAN WAR,
11930,THE TROJAN WAR,In form a god! The panther's speckled hide
11931,THE TROJAN WAR,"Flowed o'er his armor with an easy pride,--"
11932,THE TROJAN WAR,"His bended bow across his shoulders flung,"
11933,THE TROJAN WAR,"His sword beside him negligently hung,"
11934,THE TROJAN WAR,"Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,"
11935,THE TROJAN WAR,And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.[1]
11936,THE TROJAN WAR,
11937,THE TROJAN WAR,"Him, Menelaüs whom he had betrayed, Menelaüs loved of Mars, raging"
11938,THE TROJAN WAR,"like a lion, swift espies and, leaping from his chariot, hastens to"
11939,THE TROJAN WAR,"encounter. But Paris, smitten with a sense of his own treachery,"
11940,THE TROJAN WAR,"fearful, trembling, pale at sight of the avenger, betakes himself to"
11941,THE TROJAN WAR,"his heels and hides in the thick of the forces behind. Upbraided,"
11942,THE TROJAN WAR,"however, by the generous Hector, noblest of Priam's sons, the handsome"
11943,THE TROJAN WAR,Trojan recovers his self-possession and consents to meet Menelaüs
11944,THE TROJAN WAR,in formal combat between the opposing hosts: Helen and the wealth
11945,THE TROJAN WAR,"she brought to be the prize; and, thus, the long war to reach its"
11946,THE TROJAN WAR,"termination. The Greeks accept the proposal, and a truce is agreed upon"
11947,THE TROJAN WAR,"that sacrifices may be made on either side for victory, and the duel"
11948,THE TROJAN WAR,proceed.
11949,THE TROJAN WAR,
11950,THE TROJAN WAR,"=204. Helen surveys the Grecian Host.= Meantime, Iris, the goddess of"
11951,THE TROJAN WAR,"the rainbow, summons Helen to view the impending duel. At her loom in"
11952,THE TROJAN WAR,"the Trojan palace the ill-starred daughter of Leda is sitting, weaving"
11953,THE TROJAN WAR,in a golden web her own sad story. At memory of her former husband's
11954,THE TROJAN WAR,"love, her home, her parents, the princess drops a tear; then, softly"
11955,THE TROJAN WAR,"sighing, turns her footsteps to the Scæan gate. No word is said of"
11956,THE TROJAN WAR,"her matchless beauty, but what it was Homer shows us by its effect."
11957,THE TROJAN WAR,For as she approaches the tower where aged Priam and his gray-haired
11958,THE TROJAN WAR,"chieftains sit, these cry,--"
11959,THE TROJAN WAR,
11960,THE TROJAN WAR,"""No wonder such celestial charms"

12014,THE TROJAN WAR,
12015,THE TROJAN WAR,=205. Menelaüs defeats Paris.= Now from both sides sacrifices have been
12016,THE TROJAN WAR,"made to Jove, avenger of oaths, with prayer for victory and vow of"
12017,THE TROJAN WAR,fidelity to the contract made. But Jove vouchsafes not yet fulfillment.
12018,THE TROJAN WAR,The lists are measured out by Hector and Ulysses. The duel is on. Paris
12019,THE TROJAN WAR,"throws his spear: it strikes, but fails to penetrate the shield of"
12020,THE TROJAN WAR,"Menelaüs. Menelaüs then breaks his blade upon the helmet of the Trojan,"
12021,THE TROJAN WAR,"seizes him by the horsehair crest, and drags him toward the Grecian"
12022,THE TROJAN WAR,lines. But Aphrodite touches the chin strap of Paris' headpiece so that
12023,THE TROJAN WAR,"it breaks and leaves the futile helmet in the victor's hand. Then,"
12024,THE TROJAN WAR,"wrapping her favorite in a mist, the goddess bears him from the pursuit"
12025,THE TROJAN WAR,"of the furious Menelaüs, and, laying him safe in Helen's chamber,"
12026,THE TROJAN WAR,"summons his mistress, who first upbraids, then soothes him with her"
12027,THE TROJAN WAR,love.
12028,THE TROJAN WAR,
12029,THE TROJAN WAR,"The Greeks claim the victory, and with justice. The Trojans, then and"
12030,THE TROJAN WAR,"there, would have yielded Helen and her wealth, and the fate of Troy"
12031,THE TROJAN WAR,"might have been averted, had it not been for the machinations of the"
12032,THE TROJAN WAR,"goddesses, Juno and Minerva. These could not bear that the hated city"
12033,THE TROJAN WAR,"should thus escape. Prompted by the insidious urging of Minerva, one of"
12034,THE TROJAN WAR,"the Trojans, Pandarus, breaks the truce; he shoots his arrow full at"
12035,THE TROJAN WAR,"the heart of the unsuspecting Menelaüs. Minerva, of course, deflects"
12036,THE TROJAN WAR,the fatal shaft. But the treachery has accomplished its purpose; the
12037,THE TROJAN WAR,war is reopened with fresh bitterness.
12038,THE TROJAN WAR,
12039,THE TROJAN WAR,=206. The Two Days' Battle.= The battle which then begins lasts for
12040,THE TROJAN WAR,two whole days. In its progress we witness a series of single combats.
12041,THE TROJAN WAR,"Pandarus the archer wounds Diomede, the son of Tydeus. He in turn,"
12042,THE TROJAN WAR,"raging over the plain, fells Pandarus with his spear and crushes Æneas,"
12043,THE TROJAN WAR,"Priam's valiant kinsman, to his knees with a great stone. Venus shrouds"
12044,THE TROJAN WAR,"her fallen son in her shining veil and will rescue him. But Diomedes,"
12045,THE TROJAN WAR,"clear of vision, spies her out and drives his pointed spear against"
12046,THE TROJAN WAR,"her hand, grazing the palm of it. Out leaps the ichor, life-stream of"
12047,THE TROJAN WAR,"the blessed gods, and the goddess shrieking drops her burden and flees"
12048,THE TROJAN WAR,"from the jeering Diomede;--nay, mounts even to Olympus where, sobbing"
12049,THE TROJAN WAR,"in the arms of her mother, Dione, she finds solace of her pain, and"
12050,THE TROJAN WAR,"straightway turns to hopes of vengeance. Æneas, meantime, is wrapped by"
12051,THE TROJAN WAR,"Ph[oe]bus Apollo in a dusky cloud and borne aloft to that god's temple,"
12052,THE TROJAN WAR,where Diana and Latona heal him.
12053,THE TROJAN WAR,
12054,THE TROJAN WAR,"To Diomede still breathing slaughter, the god of war himself, Mars, now"
12055,THE TROJAN WAR,"appears in form of a Thracian captain, opposing him and stirring Hector"
12056,THE TROJAN WAR,and the swiftly recovered Æneas and the godlike Sarpedon against the
12057,THE TROJAN WAR,"Greeks. And the Greeks give back, but the keen eye of Diomede pierces"
12058,THE TROJAN WAR,"the disguise of the War-god, and he shouts a warning to his comrades."
12059,THE TROJAN WAR,"Then Minerva descends to where Diomede, the son of Tydeus, is resting"
12060,THE TROJAN WAR,"beside his chariot, and she spurs him afresh to the fray. ""Thou joy"
12061,THE TROJAN WAR,"of my heart,"" says she, ""fear thou neither Mars nor any other of the"
12062,THE TROJAN WAR,"immortals, for I shall help thee mightily."" So she takes the place of"
12063,THE TROJAN WAR,"his charioteer, and together they drive upon the War-god. And that one"
12064,THE TROJAN WAR,"cannot come at the son of Tydeus to strike him down, because of the"
12065,THE TROJAN WAR,"ward that Minerva vouchsafes. But, for his part, Diomede strikes his"
12066,THE TROJAN WAR,"spear against the nethermost belly of Mars and wounds him, rending"
12067,THE TROJAN WAR,his fair skin; and he plucks forth the spear again. Then brazen Mars
12068,THE TROJAN WAR,"bellows loud as nine or ten thousand soldiers all at once; and, like"
12069,THE TROJAN WAR,"Venus before him, betakes himself to Olympus. There, complaining to"
12070,THE TROJAN WAR,"Jove, he receives stern reprimand for his intolerant and hateful"
12071,THE TROJAN WAR,"spirit, stirring men ever to strife,--""like thine own mother Juno,"
12072,THE TROJAN WAR,"after whom, not after me, thou takest."" Thus, the father of the gods;"
12073,THE TROJAN WAR,"and he makes an end, and bids Pæan, the family physician, heal him."
12074,THE TROJAN WAR,
12075,THE TROJAN WAR,"Diomedes, still bearing down upon the Trojans, is about to fight with"
12076,THE TROJAN WAR,"a young warrior when, struck by his appearance, he inquires his name."
12077,THE TROJAN WAR,"It is Glaucus, and the youth is grandson of the noble Bellerophon."
12078,THE TROJAN WAR,Then Diomede of the loud war cry is glad and strikes his spear into
12079,THE TROJAN WAR,"the earth and declines to fight. ""For lo,"" says he, ""our grandfathers"
12080,THE TROJAN WAR,"were guest-friends, and guest-friends are we. Why slay each other?"
12081,THE TROJAN WAR,"There are multitudes of Trojans for me to slay, and for thee Achæans"
12082,THE TROJAN WAR,"in multitude, if thou canst. Let us twain rather exchange arms as a"
12083,THE TROJAN WAR,"testimony of our good faith."" And this they do; and Diomede gets the"
12084,THE TROJAN WAR,"best of the bargain, his armor being worth but nine oxen, and young"
12085,THE TROJAN WAR,Glaucus' five score.
12086,THE TROJAN WAR,
12087,THE TROJAN WAR,=207. Hector and Andromache.= The Trojans being still pushed nearer to
12088,THE TROJAN WAR,"their own walls, Hector, bravest of Priam's sons, returns to the city"
12089,THE TROJAN WAR,"to urge the women to prayer, and to carry the loitering Paris back with"
12090,THE TROJAN WAR,"him to the defense. Here he meets his brave mother Hecuba, and then the"
12091,THE TROJAN WAR,"fair Helen; but most to our purpose and his, his wife, the white-armed"
12092,THE TROJAN WAR,"Andromache, the noblest of the women of the Iliad, for whom he has"
12093,THE TROJAN WAR,searched in vain.
12094,THE TROJAN WAR,
12095,THE TROJAN WAR,[Illustration: FIG. 154. HECTOR'S FAREWELL
12096,THE TROJAN WAR,
12097,THE TROJAN WAR,From the relief by Thorwaldsen]
12098,THE TROJAN WAR,
12099,THE TROJAN WAR,But when he had passed through the great city and was come to the
12100,THE TROJAN WAR,"Scæan gates, whereby he was minded to issue upon the plain, then"
12101,THE TROJAN WAR,"came his dear-won wife, running to meet him, even Andromache,"
12102,THE TROJAN WAR,daughter of great-hearted Eëtion.... So she met him now; and with
12103,THE TROJAN WAR,"her went the handmaid bearing in her bosom the tender boy, the"
12104,THE TROJAN WAR,"little child, Hector's loved son, like unto a beautiful star. Him"
12105,THE TROJAN WAR,"Hector called Scamandrius, but all the folk Astyanax, ""defender"
12106,THE TROJAN WAR,"of the city."" So now he smiled and gazed at his boy silently, and"
12107,THE TROJAN WAR,"Andromache stood by his side weeping, and clasped her hand in"
12108,THE TROJAN WAR,"his, and spake and called upon his name. ""Dear my lord, this thy"
12109,THE TROJAN WAR,"hardihood will undo thee, neither hast thou any pity for thine"
12110,THE TROJAN WAR,"infant boy, nor for hapless me that soon shall be thy widow; for"
12111,THE TROJAN WAR,soon will the Achæans all set upon thee and slay thee. But it
12112,THE TROJAN WAR,were better for me to go down to the grave if I lose thee; for
12113,THE TROJAN WAR,"nevermore will any comfort be mine, when once thou, even thou,"
12114,THE TROJAN WAR,"hast met thy fate,--but only sorrow. Moreover I have no father,"
12115,THE TROJAN WAR,"now, nor lady mother.... And the seven brothers that were mine"
12116,THE TROJAN WAR,"within our halls, all these on the selfsame day went within the"
12117,THE TROJAN WAR,"house of Hades; for fleet-footed, goodly Achilles slew them all"
12118,THE TROJAN WAR,"amid their kine of trailing gait and white-faced sheep.... Nay,"
12119,THE TROJAN WAR,"Hector, thou art to me father and lady mother, yea and brother,"
12120,THE TROJAN WAR,"even as thou art my goodly husband. Come now, have pity and abide"
12121,THE TROJAN WAR,"here upon the tower, lest thou make thy child an orphan and thy"
12122,THE TROJAN WAR,"wife a widow."" ..."
12123,THE TROJAN WAR,
12124,THE TROJAN WAR,"Then great Hector of the glancing helm answered her: ""Surely I"
12125,THE TROJAN WAR,"take thought for all these things, my wife; but I have very sore"
12126,THE TROJAN WAR,"shame of the Trojans and Trojan dames with trailing robes, if"
12127,THE TROJAN WAR,like a coward I shrink away from battle. Moreover mine own soul
12128,THE TROJAN WAR,"forbiddeth me, seeing I have learnt ever to be valiant and fight"
12129,THE TROJAN WAR,"in the forefront of the Trojans, winning my father's great glory"
12130,THE TROJAN WAR,"and mine own. Yea of a surety, I know this in heart and soul; the"
12131,THE TROJAN WAR,"day shall come for holy Ilios to be laid low, and Priam and the"
12132,THE TROJAN WAR,folk of Priam of the good ashen spear. Yet doth the anguish of
12133,THE TROJAN WAR,"the Trojans hereafter not so much trouble me, neither Hecuba's"
12134,THE TROJAN WAR,"own, neither king Priam's, neither my brethren's, the many and"
12135,THE TROJAN WAR,"brave that shall fall in the dust before their foemen, as doth"
12136,THE TROJAN WAR,thine anguish in the day when some mail-clad Achæan shall lead
12137,THE TROJAN WAR,"thee weeping, and rob thee of the light of freedom.... But me in"
12138,THE TROJAN WAR,"death may the heaped-up earth be covering, ere I hear thy crying"
12139,THE TROJAN WAR,"and thy carrying into captivity.""[289]"
12140,THE TROJAN WAR,
12141,THE TROJAN WAR,"So spoke the great-hearted hero, and stretched his arms out to take his"
12142,THE TROJAN WAR,little boy. But
12143,THE TROJAN WAR,
12144,THE TROJAN WAR,"The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,"
12145,THE TROJAN WAR,"Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest."
12146,THE TROJAN WAR,"With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,"
12147,THE TROJAN WAR,"And Hector hasted to relieve his child,--"
12148,THE TROJAN WAR,The glittering terrors from his brows unbound
12149,THE TROJAN WAR,And placed the beaming helmet on the ground.
12150,THE TROJAN WAR,"Then kissed the child, and, lifting high in air,"
12151,THE TROJAN WAR,"Thus to the gods, preferred a father's prayer:"
12152,THE TROJAN WAR,"""O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,"
12153,THE TROJAN WAR,And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!
12154,THE TROJAN WAR,"Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,"
12155,THE TROJAN WAR,"To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,"
12156,THE TROJAN WAR,Against his country's foes the war to wage.
12157,THE TROJAN WAR,And rise the Hector of the future age!
12158,THE TROJAN WAR,"So when, triumphant from successive toils"
12159,THE TROJAN WAR,"Of heroes slain, he bears the reeking spoils,"
12160,THE TROJAN WAR,Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim
12161,THE TROJAN WAR,"And say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame':"
12162,THE TROJAN WAR,"While, pleased, amidst the general shouts of Troy,"
12163,THE TROJAN WAR,"His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.""[290]"
12164,THE TROJAN WAR,
12165,THE TROJAN WAR,"So prayed he, the glorious Hector, foreboding of the future, but"
12166,THE TROJAN WAR,"little thinking that, when he himself was slain and the city sacked,"
12167,THE TROJAN WAR,his starlike son should be cast headlong to death from Troy's high
12168,THE TROJAN WAR,"towers, and his dear wife led into captivity as he had dreaded,"
12169,THE TROJAN WAR,"indeed, and by none other than Neoptolemus, the son of his mortal foe,"
12170,THE TROJAN WAR,"Achilles. But now Hector laid the boy in the arms of his wife, and she,"
12171,THE TROJAN WAR,"smiling tearfully, gathered him to her fragrant bosom; and her husband"
12172,THE TROJAN WAR,"pitied her, and caressed her with his hand, and bade her farewell,"
12173,THE TROJAN WAR,saying:
12174,THE TROJAN WAR,
12175,THE TROJAN WAR,"""Andromache! my soul's far better part,"
12176,THE TROJAN WAR,Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?
12177,THE TROJAN WAR,"No hostile hand can antedate my doom,"
12178,THE TROJAN WAR,Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.
12179,THE TROJAN WAR,Fixed is the term to all the race of earth;
12180,THE TROJAN WAR,"And such the hard condition of our birth,"
12181,THE TROJAN WAR,"No force can then resist, no flight can save;"
12182,THE TROJAN WAR,"All sink alike, the fearful and the brave."
12183,THE TROJAN WAR,"No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,"
12184,THE TROJAN WAR,"There guide the spindle, and direct the loom;"
12185,THE TROJAN WAR,"Me glory summons to the martial scene,"
12186,THE TROJAN WAR,The field of combat is the sphere for men.
12187,THE TROJAN WAR,"Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,"
12188,THE TROJAN WAR,"The first in danger, as the first in fame.""[291]"
12189,THE TROJAN WAR,
12190,THE TROJAN WAR,"He took up his horsehair crested helmet; and she departed to her home,"
12191,THE TROJAN WAR,"oft looking back and letting fall big tears, thinking that he would no"
12192,THE TROJAN WAR,more come back from battle.
12193,THE TROJAN WAR,
12194,THE TROJAN WAR,=208. Neptune aids the Discouraged Greeks.= But the end was not to be
12195,THE TROJAN WAR,"so soon. Hector, returning to the field, challenged the bravest of"
12196,THE TROJAN WAR,the Greeks to combat. Nine accepted the challenge; but the lot fell
12197,THE TROJAN WAR,"upon Ajax, the son of Telamon. The duel lasted till night, with deeds"
12198,THE TROJAN WAR,"of valor on both sides; and the heroes parted, each testifying to his"
12199,THE TROJAN WAR,foeman's worth. The next day a truce was declared for the burning of
12200,THE TROJAN WAR,"the dead; but, soon after, the conflict was renewed, and before the"
12201,THE TROJAN WAR,might of Hector and his troops the Greeks were driven back to their
12202,THE TROJAN WAR,trenches.
12203,THE TROJAN WAR,
12204,THE TROJAN WAR,"Then Agamemnon, king of men, called another council of his wisest and"
12205,THE TROJAN WAR,"bravest chiefs and, grievously discouraged, proposed, this time in"
12206,THE TROJAN WAR,"earnest, that they reëmbark and sail home to Greece.[292] In the debate"
12207,THE TROJAN WAR,that ensued Nestor advised that an embassy should be sent to Achilles
12208,THE TROJAN WAR,persuading him to return to the field; and that Agamemnon should yield
12209,THE TROJAN WAR,"the maiden, the cause of dispute, with ample gifts to atone for the"
12210,THE TROJAN WAR,"wrong he had done. Agamemnon assented; and Ulysses, Ajax, and Ph[oe]nix"
12211,THE TROJAN WAR,were sent to carry to Achilles the penitent message. They performed
12212,THE TROJAN WAR,"that duty, but Achilles was deaf to their entreaties. He positively"
12213,THE TROJAN WAR,refused to return to the attack and persisted in his determination to
12214,THE TROJAN WAR,embark for Greece without delay.

12219,THE TROJAN WAR,
12220,THE TROJAN WAR,"Meanwhile the Greeks, having constructed a rampart around their ships,"
12221,THE TROJAN WAR,"were now, instead of besieging Troy, in a manner themselves besieged,"
12222,THE TROJAN WAR,within their rampart. The next day after the unsuccessful embassy to
12223,THE TROJAN WAR,"Achilles, another battle was fought, in which Agamemnon raged mightily"
12224,THE TROJAN WAR,"with his spear till, wounded, he was forced to retire to the hollow"
12225,THE TROJAN WAR,"ships; and Ulysses, too, bravely warring, had a narrow escape with"
12226,THE TROJAN WAR,"life.[293] Then the Trojans, favored by Jove, succeeded in forcing"
12227,THE TROJAN WAR,a passage through the Grecian rampart and were about to set fire to
12228,THE TROJAN WAR,"the ships. But Neptune, seeing the Greeks hard pressed, came to their"
12229,THE TROJAN WAR,"rescue.[294] Appearing in the form of Calchas the prophet, he raised"
12230,THE TROJAN WAR,the ardor of the warriors to such a pitch that they forced the Trojans
12231,THE TROJAN WAR,"to give way. Here Ajax, son of Telamon, performed prodigies of valor."
12232,THE TROJAN WAR,"Bearing his massy shield and ""shaking his far-shadowing spear,"" he"
12233,THE TROJAN WAR,"encountered Hector.[295] The Greek shouted defiance, to which Hector"
12234,THE TROJAN WAR,"replied, and hurled his lance at the huge warrior. It was well aimed"
12235,THE TROJAN WAR,and struck Ajax where the belts that bore his sword and shield
12236,THE TROJAN WAR,"crossed each other on the breast, but the double guard prevented its"
12237,THE TROJAN WAR,"penetrating, and it fell harmless. Then Ajax, seizing a huge stone,"
12238,THE TROJAN WAR,"one of those that served to prop the ships, hurled it at Hector. It"
12239,THE TROJAN WAR,struck him near the neck and stretched him on the plain. His followers
12240,THE TROJAN WAR,instantly seized him and bore him off stunned and wounded.

12246,THE TROJAN WAR,=209. Jupiter inspirits the Trojans.= While Neptune was thus aiding
12247,THE TROJAN WAR,"the Greeks and driving back the Trojans, Jupiter saw nothing of what"
12248,THE TROJAN WAR,"was going on, for his attention had been drawn from the field by"
12249,THE TROJAN WAR,the wiles of Juno.[296] That goddess had arrayed herself in all her
12250,THE TROJAN WAR,"charms, and to crown all had borrowed of Venus her girdle, the Cestus,"
12251,THE TROJAN WAR,which enhanced the wearer's charms to such a degree that they were
12252,THE TROJAN WAR,"irresistible. So prepared, Juno had joined her husband, who sat on"
12253,THE TROJAN WAR,"Olympus watching the battle. When he beheld her, the fondness of his"
12254,THE TROJAN WAR,"early love revived and, forgetting the contending armies and all other"
12255,THE TROJAN WAR,"affairs of state, he gave himself up to her and let the battle go as it"
12256,THE TROJAN WAR,would.
12257,THE TROJAN WAR,
12258,THE TROJAN WAR,"But this oblivion did not continue long. When, upon turning his"
12259,THE TROJAN WAR,"eyes downward, the cloud-compeller beheld Hector stretched, almost"
12260,THE TROJAN WAR,"lifeless, on the plain, he angrily dismissed Juno, commanding her to"
12261,THE TROJAN WAR,send Iris and Apollo to him.[297] The former bore a peremptory message
12262,THE TROJAN WAR,"to Neptune, ordering him to quit the contest. Apollo was dispatched"
12263,THE TROJAN WAR,to heal Hector's bruises and to inspirit his heart. These orders were
12264,THE TROJAN WAR,"obeyed with such speed that while the battle was still raging, Hector"
12265,THE TROJAN WAR,returned to the field and Neptune betook himself to his own dominions.

12268,THE TROJAN WAR,
12269,THE TROJAN WAR,=210. Achilles and Patroclus.= An arrow from the bow of Paris had
12270,THE TROJAN WAR,"wounded Machaon, son of Æsculapius, a brave warrior, who, having"
12271,THE TROJAN WAR,"inherited his father's art, was of great value to the Greeks as their"
12272,THE TROJAN WAR,"surgeon. Nestor, taking Machaon in his chariot, conveyed him from the"
12273,THE TROJAN WAR,"field. As they passed the ships of Achilles, that hero, looking over"
12274,THE TROJAN WAR,"the battle, saw the chariot of Nestor, and recognized the old chief,"
12275,THE TROJAN WAR,"but could not discern who the wounded warrior was. Calling Patroclus,"
12276,THE TROJAN WAR,"his companion and dearest friend, he sent him to Nestor's tent to"
12277,THE TROJAN WAR,"inquire. Patroclus, performing the behest, saw Machaon wounded and,"
12278,THE TROJAN WAR,"having told the cause of his coming, would have hastened away, but"
12279,THE TROJAN WAR,Nestor detained him to tell him the extent of the Grecian calamities.
12280,THE TROJAN WAR,"He reminded him also how, at the time of the departure for Troy,"
12281,THE TROJAN WAR,Achilles and himself had been charged by their respective sires: the
12282,THE TROJAN WAR,"one to aspire to the highest pitch of glory; the other, as the elder,"
12283,THE TROJAN WAR,"to keep watch over his friend and to guide his inexperience. ""Now,"""
12284,THE TROJAN WAR,"said Nestor, ""is the time for such guidance. If the gods so please,"
12285,THE TROJAN WAR,"thou mayest win Achilles back to the common cause; but if not, let him"
12286,THE TROJAN WAR,"at least send his soldiers to the field, and come thou, Patroclus,"
12287,THE TROJAN WAR,clad in his armor. Perhaps the very sight of it may drive back the
12288,THE TROJAN WAR,"Trojans.""[298]"
12289,THE TROJAN WAR,
12290,THE TROJAN WAR,"=211. Patroclus in the Armor of Achilles.= Patroclus, strongly moved by"
12291,THE TROJAN WAR,"this address, hastened to his friend, revolving in his mind what he had"
12292,THE TROJAN WAR,seen and heard.[299] He told the prince the sad condition of affairs
12293,THE TROJAN WAR,"at the camp of their late associates; Diomede, Ulysses, Agamemnon,"
12294,THE TROJAN WAR,"Machaon, all wounded, the rampart broken down, the enemy among the"
12295,THE TROJAN WAR,ships preparing to burn them and thus to cut off all means of return to
12296,THE TROJAN WAR,"Greece. While they spoke, the flames burst forth from one of the ships."
12297,THE TROJAN WAR,"Achilles, at the sight, relented so far as to intrust Patroclus with"
12298,THE TROJAN WAR,the Myrmidons for the onslaught and to lend him his armor that he might
12299,THE TROJAN WAR,thereby strike the more terror into the minds of the Trojans. Without
12300,THE TROJAN WAR,"delay the soldiers were marshaled, Patroclus put on the radiant armor,"
12301,THE TROJAN WAR,"mounted the chariot of Achilles, and led forth the men ardent for"
12302,THE TROJAN WAR,"battle. But before his friend went, Achilles strictly charged him to"
12303,THE TROJAN WAR,"be content with repelling the foe. ""Seek not,"" said he, ""to press the"
12304,THE TROJAN WAR,"Trojans without me, lest thou add still more to the disgrace already"
12305,THE TROJAN WAR,"mine."" Then exhorting the troops to do their best, he dismissed them"
12306,THE TROJAN WAR,full of ardor to the fight.
12307,THE TROJAN WAR,
12308,THE TROJAN WAR,Patroclus and his Myrmidons at once plunged into the contest where
12309,THE TROJAN WAR,"it raged hottest. At the sight of them the joyful Grecians shouted,"
12310,THE TROJAN WAR,"and the ships reëchoed the acclaim; but the Trojans, beholding the"
12311,THE TROJAN WAR,"well-known armor, struck with terror, looked everywhere for refuge."
12312,THE TROJAN WAR,First those who had got possession of the ship and set it on fire
12313,THE TROJAN WAR,allowed the Grecians to retake it and extinguish the flames. Then
12314,THE TROJAN WAR,"the rest fled in dismay. Ajax, Menelaüs, and the two sons of Nestor"
12315,THE TROJAN WAR,performed prodigies of valor. Hector was forced to turn his horses'
12316,THE TROJAN WAR,"heads and retire from the enclosure, leaving his men encumbered in the"
12317,THE TROJAN WAR,"fosse to escape as they could. Patroclus drove all before him, slaying"
12318,THE TROJAN WAR,many; nor did one dare to make a stand against him.

12321,THE TROJAN WAR,
12322,THE TROJAN WAR,=212. The Deaths of Sarpedon and Patroclus.= At last the grandson of
12323,THE TROJAN WAR,"Bellerophon, Sarpedon, son of Jove and Laodamia, ventured to oppose"
12324,THE TROJAN WAR,the Greek warrior. The Olympian looked down upon his son and would
12325,THE TROJAN WAR,"have snatched him from the fate impending, but Juno hinted that if he"
12326,THE TROJAN WAR,"did so, the other inhabitants of heaven might be induced to interpose"
12327,THE TROJAN WAR,"in like manner whenever any of their offspring were endangered,--an"
12328,THE TROJAN WAR,"argument to which Jove yielded. Sarpedon threw his spear, but missed"
12329,THE TROJAN WAR,"Patroclus; the spear of the Greek, on the other hand, pierced"
12330,THE TROJAN WAR,"Sarpedon's breast, and he fell, calling to his friends to save his"
12331,THE TROJAN WAR,body from the foe. Then a furious contest arose for the corpse. The
12332,THE TROJAN WAR,"Greeks succeeded in stripping Sarpedon of his armor, but Jove would not"
12333,THE TROJAN WAR,suffer the body to be dishonored. By his command Apollo snatched it
12334,THE TROJAN WAR,from the midst of the combatants and committed it to the care of the
12335,THE TROJAN WAR,"twin brothers Death and Sleep. By them it was transported to Lycia,"
12336,THE TROJAN WAR,"Sarpedon's native land, and there received due funeral rites."
12337,THE TROJAN WAR,
12338,THE TROJAN WAR,Thus far Patroclus had succeeded to the utmost in repelling the foe and
12339,THE TROJAN WAR,"relieving his countrymen, but now came a change of fortune. Hector,"
12340,THE TROJAN WAR,"borne in his chariot, confronted him. Patroclus threw a vast stone at"
12341,THE TROJAN WAR,"the Trojan, which missed its aim, but smote Cebriones, the charioteer,"
12342,THE TROJAN WAR,and felled him from the car. Hector leaped from the chariot to rescue
12343,THE TROJAN WAR,"his friend, and Patroclus also descended to complete his victory. Thus"
12344,THE TROJAN WAR,"the two heroes met face to face. At this decisive moment the poet, as"
12345,THE TROJAN WAR,"if reluctant to give Hector the glory, records that Ph[oe]bus Apollo,"
12346,THE TROJAN WAR,"taking part against Patroclus, struck the helmet from his head and the"
12347,THE TROJAN WAR,lance from his hand. At the same moment an obscure Trojan wounded him
12348,THE TROJAN WAR,"in the back, and Hector pressing forward pierced him with his spear. He"
12349,THE TROJAN WAR,fell mortally wounded.
12350,THE TROJAN WAR,
12351,THE TROJAN WAR,Then arose a tremendous conflict for the body of Patroclus; but his
12352,THE TROJAN WAR,"armor was at once taken possession of by Hector, who, retiring a short"
12353,THE TROJAN WAR,"distance, divested himself of his own mail, put on that of Achilles,"
12354,THE TROJAN WAR,"then returned to the fight.[300] Ajax and Menelaüs defended the body,"
12355,THE TROJAN WAR,and Hector and his bravest warriors struggled to capture it. The battle
12356,THE TROJAN WAR,"still raged with equal fortune, when Jove enveloped the whole face"
12357,THE TROJAN WAR,"of heaven in a cloud. The lightning flashed, the thunder roared, and"
12358,THE TROJAN WAR,"Ajax, looking round for some one whom he might dispatch to Achilles"
12359,THE TROJAN WAR,to tell him of the death of his friend and of the imminent danger of
12360,THE TROJAN WAR,"his remains falling into the hands of the enemy, could see no suitable"
12361,THE TROJAN WAR,messenger. In desperation he exclaimed:
12362,THE TROJAN WAR,
12363,THE TROJAN WAR,"""Father of heaven and earth! deliver thou"
12364,THE TROJAN WAR,Achaia's host from darkness; clear the skies;
12365,THE TROJAN WAR,"Give day; and, since thy sovereign will is such,"
12366,THE TROJAN WAR,"Destruction with it; but, oh, give us day!""[301]"
12367,THE TROJAN WAR,
12368,THE TROJAN WAR,Jupiter heard the prayer and dispersed the clouds. Ajax sent Antilochus
12369,THE TROJAN WAR,to Achilles with the intelligence of Patroclus' death and of the
12370,THE TROJAN WAR,conflict raging for his remains; and the Greeks at last succeeded in
12371,THE TROJAN WAR,"bearing off the body to the ships, closely pursued by Hector and Æneas"
12372,THE TROJAN WAR,and the rest of the Trojans.
12373,THE TROJAN WAR,
12374,THE TROJAN WAR,=213. The Remorse of Achilles.= Achilles heard the fate of his friend
12375,THE TROJAN WAR,with such distress that Antilochus feared for a while lest he might
12376,THE TROJAN WAR,"destroy himself.[302] His groans reached the ears of Thetis, far down"
12377,THE TROJAN WAR,"in the deeps of ocean where she abode, and she hastened to inquire"
12378,THE TROJAN WAR,the cause. She found him overwhelmed with self-reproach that he had
12379,THE TROJAN WAR,suffered his friend to fall a victim to his resentment. His only
12380,THE TROJAN WAR,consolation was the hope of revenge. He would fly instantly in search
12381,THE TROJAN WAR,of Hector. But his mother reminded him that he was now without armor
12382,THE TROJAN WAR,"and promised, if he would but wait till the morrow, to procure for"
12383,THE TROJAN WAR,him a suit of armor from Vulcan more than equal to that he had lost.
12384,THE TROJAN WAR,"He consented, and Thetis immediately repaired to Vulcan's palace."
12385,THE TROJAN WAR,"She found him busy at his forge, making tripods for his own use, so"
12386,THE TROJAN WAR,artfully constructed that they moved forward of their own accord when
12387,THE TROJAN WAR,"wanted, and retired again when dismissed. On hearing the request of"
12388,THE TROJAN WAR,"Thetis, Vulcan immediately laid aside his work and hastened to comply"
12389,THE TROJAN WAR,with her wishes. He fabricated a splendid suit of armor for Achilles;
12390,THE TROJAN WAR,"first a shield adorned with elaborate devices, of which a noble"
12391,THE TROJAN WAR,"description is given by Homer, then a helmet crested with gold, then a"
12392,THE TROJAN WAR,"corselet and greaves of impenetrable temper, all perfectly adapted to"
12393,THE TROJAN WAR,"the hero's form, and of consummate workmanship. The suit was made in"
12394,THE TROJAN WAR,"one night, and Thetis, receiving it, descended to earth and laid it at"
12395,THE TROJAN WAR,Achilles' feet at the dawn of day.
12396,THE TROJAN WAR,
12397,THE TROJAN WAR,=214. The Reconciliation of Agamemnon and Achilles.= The first glow of
12398,THE TROJAN WAR,pleasure that Achilles had felt since the death of Patroclus was at
12399,THE TROJAN WAR,"the sight of this splendid armor.[303] And now arrayed in it, he went"
12400,THE TROJAN WAR,"forth to the camp, calling the chiefs to council. When the leaders were"
12401,THE TROJAN WAR,"assembled, Achilles addressed them. Renouncing his displeasure against"
12402,THE TROJAN WAR,Agamemnon and bitterly lamenting the miseries that had resulted from
12403,THE TROJAN WAR,"it, he called on them to proceed at once to the field. Agamemnon made"
12404,THE TROJAN WAR,"a suitable reply, laying the blame on Ate, the goddess of infatuation;"
12405,THE TROJAN WAR,and thereupon complete reconcilement took place between the heroes.
12406,THE TROJAN WAR,
12407,THE TROJAN WAR,"Then Achilles went forth to battle, heartened by the inspiration of"
12408,THE TROJAN WAR,Minerva and filled with a rage and thirst for vengeance that made him
12409,THE TROJAN WAR,"irresistible. As he mounted his chariot, one of his immortal coursers"
12410,THE TROJAN WAR,"was, strange to say, endowed suddenly with speech from on high and,"
12411,THE TROJAN WAR,"breaking into prophecy, warned the hero of his approaching doom. But,"
12412,THE TROJAN WAR,"nothing daunted, Achilles pressed upon the foe. The bravest warriors"
12413,THE TROJAN WAR,"fled before him or fell by his lance.[304] Hector, cautioned by Apollo,"
12414,THE TROJAN WAR,"kept aloof; but the god, assuming the form of one of Priam's sons,"
12415,THE TROJAN WAR,"Lycaon, urged Æneas to encounter the terrible warrior. Æneas, though"
12416,THE TROJAN WAR,"he felt himself unequal, did not decline the combat. He hurled his"
12417,THE TROJAN WAR,"spear with all his force against the shield, the work of Vulcan. The"
12418,THE TROJAN WAR,"spear pierced two plates of the shield, but was stopped in the third."
12419,THE TROJAN WAR,Achilles threw his spear with better success. It pierced through the
12420,THE TROJAN WAR,"shield of Æneas, but glanced near his shoulder and made no wound. Then"
12421,THE TROJAN WAR,"Æneas, seizing a stone, such as two men of modern times could hardly"
12422,THE TROJAN WAR,"lift, was about to throw it,--and Achilles, with sword drawn, was"
12423,THE TROJAN WAR,"about to rush upon him,--when Neptune, looking out upon the contest,"
12424,THE TROJAN WAR,"had pity upon Æneas, who was sure to have the worst of it. The god,"
12425,THE TROJAN WAR,"consequently, spread a cloud between the combatants and, lifting the"
12426,THE TROJAN WAR,"Trojan from the ground, bore him over the heads of warriors and steeds"
12427,THE TROJAN WAR,"to the rear of the battle. Achilles, when the mist cleared away, looked"
12428,THE TROJAN WAR,"round in vain for his adversary, and acknowledging the prodigy, turned"
12429,THE TROJAN WAR,his arms against other champions. But none dared stand before him;
12430,THE TROJAN WAR,and Priam from his city walls beheld the whole army in full flight
12431,THE TROJAN WAR,toward the city. He gave command to open wide the gates to receive the
12432,THE TROJAN WAR,"fugitives, and to shut them as soon as the Trojans should have passed,"
12433,THE TROJAN WAR,lest the enemy should enter likewise. But Achilles was so close in
12434,THE TROJAN WAR,"pursuit that that would have been impossible if Apollo had not, in the"
12435,THE TROJAN WAR,"form of Agenor, Priam's son, first encountered the swift-footed hero,"
12436,THE TROJAN WAR,"then turned in flight, and taken the way apart from the city. Achilles"
12437,THE TROJAN WAR,"pursued, and had chased his supposed victim far from the walls before"
12438,THE TROJAN WAR,the god disclosed himself.[305]
12439,THE TROJAN WAR,
12440,THE TROJAN WAR,=215. The Death of Hector.= But when the rest had escaped into the
12441,THE TROJAN WAR,"town Hector stood without, determined to await the combat. His father"
12442,THE TROJAN WAR,"called to him from the walls, begging him to retire nor tempt the"
12443,THE TROJAN WAR,"encounter. His mother, Hecuba, also besought him, but all in vain."
12444,THE TROJAN WAR,"""How can I,"" said he to himself, ""by whose command the people went to"
12445,THE TROJAN WAR,"this day's contest where so many have fallen, seek refuge for myself"
12446,THE TROJAN WAR,from a single foe? Or shall I offer to yield up Helen and all her
12447,THE TROJAN WAR,treasures and ample of our own beside? Ah no! even that is too late. He
12448,THE TROJAN WAR,"would not hear me through, but slay me while I spoke."" While he thus"
12449,THE TROJAN WAR,"ruminated, Achilles approached, terrible as Mars, his armor flashing"
12450,THE TROJAN WAR,lightning as he moved. At that sight Hector's heart failed him and
12451,THE TROJAN WAR,"he fled. Achilles swiftly pursued. They ran, still keeping near the"
12452,THE TROJAN WAR,"walls, till they had thrice encircled the city. As often as Hector"
12453,THE TROJAN WAR,approached the walls Achilles intercepted him and forced him to keep
12454,THE TROJAN WAR,out in a wider circle. But Apollo sustained Hector's strength and
12455,THE TROJAN WAR,"would not let him sink in weariness. Then Pallas, assuming the form of"
12456,THE TROJAN WAR,"Deiphobus, Hector's bravest brother, appeared suddenly at his side."
12457,THE TROJAN WAR,"Hector saw him with delight, and thus strengthened, stopped his flight,"
12458,THE TROJAN WAR,"and, turning to meet Achilles, threw his spear. It struck the shield"
12459,THE TROJAN WAR,of Achilles and bounded back. He turned to receive another from the
12460,THE TROJAN WAR,"hand of Deiphobus, but Deiphobus was gone. Then Hector understood his"
12461,THE TROJAN WAR,"doom and said, ""Alas! it is plain this is my hour to die! I thought"
12462,THE TROJAN WAR,"Deiphobus at hand, but Pallas deceived me, and he is still in Troy. But"
12463,THE TROJAN WAR,"I will not fall inglorious."" So saying he drew his falchion from his"
12464,THE TROJAN WAR,"side and rushed at once to combat. Achilles, secure behind his shield,"
12465,THE TROJAN WAR,"waited the approach of Hector. When he came within reach of his spear,"
12466,THE TROJAN WAR,"Achilles, choosing with his eye a vulnerable part where the armor"
12467,THE TROJAN WAR,"leaves the neck uncovered, aimed his spear at that part, and Hector"
12468,THE TROJAN WAR,"fell, death-wounded. Feebly he said, ""Spare my body! Let my parents"
12469,THE TROJAN WAR,"ransom it, and let me receive funeral rites from the sons and daughters"
12470,THE TROJAN WAR,"of Troy."" To which Achilles replied, ""Dog, name not ransom nor pity to"
12471,THE TROJAN WAR,"me, on whom you have brought such dire distress. No! trust me, nought"
12472,THE TROJAN WAR,shall save thy carcass from the dogs. Though twenty ransoms and thy
12473,THE TROJAN WAR,"weight in gold were offered, I should refuse it all.""[306]"
12474,THE TROJAN WAR,
12475,THE TROJAN WAR,[Illustration: FIG. 159. CONTEST OF ACHILLES AND HECTOR]
12476,THE TROJAN WAR,
12477,THE TROJAN WAR,"=216. Achilles drags the Body of Hector.= So saying, the son of Peleus"
12478,THE TROJAN WAR,"stripped the body of its armor, and, fastening cords to the feet, tied"
12479,THE TROJAN WAR,"them behind his chariot, leaving the body to trail along the ground."
12480,THE TROJAN WAR,Then mounting the chariot he lashed the steeds and so dragged the body
12481,THE TROJAN WAR,to and fro before the city. No words can tell the grief of Priam and
12482,THE TROJAN WAR,Hecuba at this sight. His people could scarce restrain the aged king
12483,THE TROJAN WAR,from rushing forth. He threw himself in the dust and besought them
12484,THE TROJAN WAR,each by name to let him pass. Hecuba's distress was not less violent.
12485,THE TROJAN WAR,The citizens stood round them weeping. The sound of the mourning
12486,THE TROJAN WAR,"reached the ears of Andromache, the wife of Hector, as she sat among"
12487,THE TROJAN WAR,her maidens at work; and anticipating evil she went forth to the wall.
12488,THE TROJAN WAR,"When she saw the horror there presented, she would have thrown herself"
12489,THE TROJAN WAR,"headlong from the wall, but fainted and fell into the arms of her"
12490,THE TROJAN WAR,"maidens. Recovering, she bewailed her fate, picturing to herself her"
12491,THE TROJAN WAR,"country ruined, herself a captive, and her son, the youthful Astyanax,"
12492,THE TROJAN WAR,dependent for his bread on the charity of strangers.
12493,THE TROJAN WAR,

12496,OF PATROCLUS],
12497,OF PATROCLUS],After Achilles and the Greeks had thus taken their revenge on the
12498,OF PATROCLUS],"slayer of Patroclus, they busied themselves in paying due funeral"
12499,OF PATROCLUS],"rites to their friend.[307] A pile was erected, and the body burned"
12500,OF PATROCLUS],"with due solemnity. Then ensued games of strength and skill, chariot"
12501,OF PATROCLUS],"races, wrestling, boxing, and archery. Later, the chiefs sat down to"
12502,OF PATROCLUS],"the funeral banquet, and finally retired to rest. But Achilles partook"
12503,OF PATROCLUS],neither of the feast nor of sleep. The recollection of his lost friend
12504,OF PATROCLUS],"kept him awake,--the memory of their companionship in toil and dangers,"
12505,OF PATROCLUS],in battle or on the perilous deep. Before the earliest dawn he left
12506,OF PATROCLUS],"his tent, and joining to his chariot his swift steeds, he fastened"
12507,OF PATROCLUS],Hector's body to be dragged behind. Twice he dragged him round the tomb
12508,OF PATROCLUS],"of Patroclus, leaving him at length stretched in the dust. But Apollo"
12509,OF PATROCLUS],would not permit the body to be torn or disfigured with all this abuse;
12510,OF PATROCLUS],he preserved it free from taint or defilement.[308]

12515,OF PATROCLUS],in pity summoned Thetis to his presence. Bidding her prevail on
12516,OF PATROCLUS],"Achilles to restore the body of Hector to the Trojans, he sent Iris to"
12517,OF PATROCLUS],encourage Priam to beg of Achilles the body of his son. Iris delivered
12518,OF PATROCLUS],"her message, and Priam prepared to obey. He opened his treasuries and"
12519,OF PATROCLUS],"took out rich garments and cloths, with ten talents in gold and two"
12520,OF PATROCLUS],splendid tripods and a golden cup of matchless workmanship. Then he
12521,OF PATROCLUS],called to his sons and bade them draw forth his litter and place in it
12522,OF PATROCLUS],the various articles designed for a ransom to Achilles. When all was
12523,OF PATROCLUS],"ready, the old king with a single companion as aged as himself, the"
12524,OF PATROCLUS],"herald Idæus, drove forth from the gates, parting there with Hecuba"
12525,OF PATROCLUS],"his queen, and all his friends, who lamented him as going to certain"

12530,OF PATROCLUS],"protector. Assuming the form of a young warrior, Mercury presented"
12531,OF PATROCLUS],"himself to the aged couple; and, when at the sight of him they"
12532,OF PATROCLUS],"hesitated whether to fly or yield, approaching he grasped Priam's hand"
12533,OF PATROCLUS],and offered to be their guide to Achilles' tent. Priam gladly accepted
12534,OF PATROCLUS],"his service, and Mercury, mounting the carriage, assumed the reins and"
12535,OF PATROCLUS],conveyed them to the camp. Then having cast the guards into a heavy
12536,OF PATROCLUS],"sleep, he introduced Priam into the tent where Achilles sat, attended"
12537,OF PATROCLUS],by two of his warriors. The aged king threw himself at the feet of
12538,OF PATROCLUS],Achilles and kissed those terrible hands which had destroyed so many
12539,OF PATROCLUS],"of his sons. ""Think, O Achilles,"" he said, ""of thine own father, full"
12540,OF PATROCLUS],"of days like me, and trembling on the gloomy verge of life. Even now,"
12541,OF PATROCLUS],"mayhap, some neighbor chief oppresses him and there is none at hand"
12542,OF PATROCLUS],"to succor him in his distress. Yet, knowing that Achilles lives, he"
12543,OF PATROCLUS],"doubtless still rejoices, hoping that one day he shall see thy face"
12544,OF PATROCLUS],"again. But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons, so late the"
12545,OF PATROCLUS],"flower of Ilium, all have fallen. Yet one I had, one more than all the"
12546,OF PATROCLUS],"rest the strength of my age, whom fighting for his country thou hast"

12548,OF PATROCLUS],Achilles! reverence the gods! recollect thy father! for his sake show
12549,OF PATROCLUS],"compassion to me!"" These words moved Achilles, and he wept, remembering"
12550,OF PATROCLUS],by turns his absent father and his lost friend. Moved with pity of
12551,OF PATROCLUS],"Priam's silver locks and beard, he raised him from the earth and spake:"

12555,OF PATROCLUS],"manifest will of Jove."" So saying he arose, went forth with his two"
12556,OF PATROCLUS],"friends, and unloaded of its charge the litter, leaving two mantles and"
12557,OF PATROCLUS],a robe for the covering of the body. This they placed on the litter and
12558,OF PATROCLUS],"spread the garments over it, that not unveiled it should be borne back"
12559,OF PATROCLUS],"to Troy. Then Achilles dismissed the old king, having first pledged"
12560,OF PATROCLUS],himself to a truce of twelve days for the funeral solemnities.
12561,OF PATROCLUS],
12562,OF PATROCLUS],"As the litter approached the city and was descried from the walls,"

12569,OF PATROCLUS],"The next day, preparations were made for the funeral solemnities. For"

12571,OF PATROCLUS],"they placed the body on the summit and applied the torch, while all"
12572,OF PATROCLUS],"Troy, thronging forth, encompassed the pyre. When it had completely"
12573,OF PATROCLUS],"burned, they quenched the cinders with wine, and, collecting the bones,"
12574,OF PATROCLUS],"placed them in a golden urn, which they buried in the earth. Over the"

12655,THE FALL OF TROY,
12656,THE FALL OF TROY,=218. The Fall of Troy.= The story of the Iliad ends with the death
12657,THE FALL OF TROY,"of Hector, and it is from the Odyssey and later poems that we learn"
12658,THE FALL OF TROY,"the fate of the other heroes. After the death of Hector, Troy did not"
12659,THE FALL OF TROY,"immediately fall, but receiving aid from new allies, still continued"
12660,THE FALL OF TROY,"its resistance. One of these allies was Memnon, the Ethiopian prince,"
12661,THE FALL OF TROY,"whose story has been already told.[311] Another was Penthesilea, queen"
12662,THE FALL OF TROY,"of the Amazons, who came with a band of female warriors. All the"
12663,THE FALL OF TROY,authorities attest the valor of these women and the fearful effect
12664,THE FALL OF TROY,"of their war cry. Penthesilea, having slain many of the bravest"
12665,THE FALL OF TROY,"Greeks, was at last slain by Achilles. But when the hero bent over his"
12666,THE FALL OF TROY,"fallen foe and contemplated her beauty, youth, and valor, he bitterly"
12667,THE FALL OF TROY,"regretted his victory. Thersites, the insolent brawler and demagogue,"
12668,THE FALL OF TROY,"attempting to ridicule his grief, was in consequence slain by the"
12669,THE FALL OF TROY,hero.[312]
12670,THE FALL OF TROY,
12671,THE FALL OF TROY,=219. The Death of Achilles.= But Achilles himself was not destined
12672,THE FALL OF TROY,"to a long life. Having by chance seen Polyxena, daughter of King"
12673,THE FALL OF TROY,"Priam,--perhaps on occasion of the truce which was allowed the Trojans"
12674,THE FALL OF TROY,"for the burial of Hector,--he was captivated with her charms; and to"
12675,THE FALL OF TROY,"win her in marriage, it is said (but not by Homer) that he agreed to"
12676,THE FALL OF TROY,influence the Greeks to make peace with Troy. While the hero was in the
12677,THE FALL OF TROY,"temple of Apollo negotiating the marriage, Paris discharged at him a"
12678,THE FALL OF TROY,"poisoned arrow,[313] which, guided by Apollo, fatally wounded him in"
12679,THE FALL OF TROY,"the heel. This was his only vulnerable spot; for Thetis, having dipped"
12680,THE FALL OF TROY,"him when an infant in the river Styx, had rendered every part of him"
12681,THE FALL OF TROY,invulnerable except that by which she held him.[314]
12682,THE FALL OF TROY,
12683,THE FALL OF TROY,=220. Contest for the Arms of Achilles.= The body of Achilles so
12684,THE FALL OF TROY,treacherously slain was rescued by Ajax and Ulysses. Thetis directed
12685,THE FALL OF TROY,the Greeks to bestow her son's armor on that hero who of all survivors
12686,THE FALL OF TROY,should be judged most deserving of it. Ajax and Ulysses were the only
12687,THE FALL OF TROY,claimants. A select number of the other chiefs were appointed to award
12688,THE FALL OF TROY,"the prize. By the will of Minerva it was awarded to Ulysses,--wisdom"
12689,THE FALL OF TROY,"being thus rated above valor. Ajax, enraged, set forth from his tent"
12690,THE FALL OF TROY,to wreak vengeance upon the Atridæ and Ulysses. But the goddess robbed
12691,THE FALL OF TROY,him of reason and turned his hand against the flocks and herds of the
12692,THE FALL OF TROY,"Argives, which he slaughtered or led captive to his tent, counting them"
12693,THE FALL OF TROY,the rivals who had wronged him. Then the cruel goddess restored to him
12694,THE FALL OF TROY,"his wits. And he, fixing his sword in the ground, prepared to take his"
12695,THE FALL OF TROY,own life:
12696,THE FALL OF TROY,
12697,THE FALL OF TROY,"""Come and look on me,"
12698,THE FALL OF TROY,"O Death, O Death,--and yet in yonder world"
12699,THE FALL OF TROY,"I shall dwell with thee, speak enough with thee;"
12700,THE FALL OF TROY,"And thee I call, thou light of golden day,"
12701,THE FALL OF TROY,"Thou Sun, who drivest on thy glorious car,"
12702,THE FALL OF TROY,"Thee, for this last time,--never more again!"
12703,THE FALL OF TROY,"O Light, O sacred land that was my home;"
12704,THE FALL OF TROY,"O Salamis, where stands my father's hearth,"
12705,THE FALL OF TROY,"Thou glorious Athens, with thy kindred race;"
12706,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ye streams and rivers here, and Troïa's plains,"
12707,THE FALL OF TROY,To you that fed my life I bid farewell;
12708,THE FALL OF TROY,"This last, last word does Ajax speak to you;"
12709,THE FALL OF TROY,"All else, I speak in Hades to the dead.""[3]"
12710,THE FALL OF TROY,
12711,THE FALL OF TROY,"Then, falling upon his sword, he died. So, in the words of his"
12712,THE FALL OF TROY,"magnanimous foe, Ulysses, passed to the god that ruleth in gloom"
12713,THE FALL OF TROY,
12714,THE FALL OF TROY,"The best and bravest of the Argive host,"
12715,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of all that came to Troïa, saving one,"
12716,THE FALL OF TROY,Achilles' self.[315]
12717,THE FALL OF TROY,
12718,THE FALL OF TROY,"On the spot where his blood sank into the earth a hyacinth sprang up,"
12719,THE FALL OF TROY,"bearing on its leaves the first two letters of his name, Ai, the Greek"
12720,THE FALL OF TROY,interjection of woe.[316]

12722,THE FALL OF TROY,[Illustration: FIG. 163. [OE]NONE WARNING PARIS]
12723,THE FALL OF TROY,
12724,THE FALL OF TROY,It was now discovered that Troy could not be taken but by the aid
12725,THE FALL OF TROY,"of the arrows of Hercules. They were in possession of Philoctetes,"
12726,THE FALL OF TROY,the friend who had been with Hercules at the last and had lighted
12727,THE FALL OF TROY,his funeral pyre. Philoctetes[317] had joined the Grecian expedition
12728,THE FALL OF TROY,against Troy; but he accidentally wounded his foot with one of the
12729,THE FALL OF TROY,"poisoned arrows, and the smell from the wound proved so offensive that"
12730,THE FALL OF TROY,his companions carried him to the isle of Lemnos and left him there.
12731,THE FALL OF TROY,"Diomede and Ulysses, or Ulysses and Neoptolemus (son of Achilles), were"
12732,THE FALL OF TROY,now sent to induce him to rejoin the army. They succeeded. Philoctetes
12733,THE FALL OF TROY,"was cured of his wound by Machaon, and Paris was the first victim of"
12734,THE FALL OF TROY,the fatal arrows.
12735,THE FALL OF TROY,
12736,THE FALL OF TROY,=221. Paris and [OE]none.= In his distress Paris bethought him of one
12737,THE FALL OF TROY,"whom in his prosperity he had forgotten. This was the nymph [OE]none,"
12738,THE FALL OF TROY,whom he had married when a youth and had abandoned for the fatal beauty
12739,THE FALL OF TROY,"of Helen. [OE]none, remembering the wrongs she had suffered, refused to"
12740,THE FALL OF TROY,heal the wound; and Paris went back to Troy and died. [OE]none quickly
12741,THE FALL OF TROY,"repented and hastened after him with remedies, but came too late, and"
12742,THE FALL OF TROY,in her grief hanged herself.
12743,THE FALL OF TROY,
12744,THE FALL OF TROY,=222. The Palladium.= There was in Troy a celebrated statue of Minerva
12745,THE FALL OF TROY,"called the Palladium. It was said to have fallen from heaven, and the"
12746,THE FALL OF TROY,belief was that the city could not be taken so long as this statue
12747,THE FALL OF TROY,remained within it. Ulysses and Diomede entered the city in disguise
12748,THE FALL OF TROY,"and succeeded in obtaining the Palladium, which they carried off to the"
12749,THE FALL OF TROY,Grecian camp.
12750,THE FALL OF TROY,
12751,THE FALL OF TROY,[Illustration: FIG. 164. THE WOODEN HORSE]
12752,THE FALL OF TROY,
12753,THE FALL OF TROY,=223. The Wooden Horse.= But Troy still held out. The Greeks began to
12754,THE FALL OF TROY,"despair of subduing it by force, and by advice of Ulysses they resorted"
12755,THE FALL OF TROY,to stratagem.[318] They pretended to be making preparations to abandon
12756,THE FALL OF TROY,the siege; and a number of the ships were withdrawn and concealed
12757,THE FALL OF TROY,behind a neighboring island. They then constructed an immense wooden
12758,THE FALL OF TROY,"horse, which they gave out was intended as a propitiatory offering to"
12759,THE FALL OF TROY,"Minerva; but it was, in fact, filled with armed men. The rest of the"
12760,THE FALL OF TROY,"Greeks then betook themselves to their ships and sailed away, as if for"
12761,THE FALL OF TROY,"a final departure. The Trojans, seeing the encampment broken up and the"
12762,THE FALL OF TROY,"fleet gone, concluded that the enemy had abandoned the siege. The gates"
12763,THE FALL OF TROY,"of the city were thrown open, and the whole population issued forth,"
12764,THE FALL OF TROY,rejoicing at the long-prohibited liberty of passing freely over the
12765,THE FALL OF TROY,scene of the late encampment. The great horse was the chief object of
12766,THE FALL OF TROY,curiosity. Some recommended that it be taken into the city as a trophy;
12767,THE FALL OF TROY,"others felt afraid of it. While they hesitated, Laocoön, the priest"
12768,THE FALL OF TROY,"of Neptune, exclaimed, ""What madness, citizens, is this! Have you not"
12769,THE FALL OF TROY,learned enough of Grecian fraud to be on your guard against it? For my
12770,THE FALL OF TROY,"part, I fear the Greeks even when they offer gifts.""[319] So saying,"
12771,THE FALL OF TROY,"he threw his lance at the horse's side. It struck, and a hollow sound"
12772,THE FALL OF TROY,reverberated like a groan. Then perhaps the people might have taken his
12773,THE FALL OF TROY,"advice and destroyed the fatal horse with its contents, but just at"
12774,THE FALL OF TROY,that moment a group of people appeared dragging forward one who seemed
12775,THE FALL OF TROY,"a prisoner and a Greek. Stupefied with terror, the captive was brought"
12776,THE FALL OF TROY,"before the chiefs. He informed them that he was a Greek, Sinon by name;"
12777,THE FALL OF TROY,"and that in consequence of the malice of Ulysses, he had been left"
12778,THE FALL OF TROY,behind by his countrymen at their departure. With regard to the wooden
12779,THE FALL OF TROY,"horse, he told them that it was a propitiatory offering to Minerva, and"
12780,THE FALL OF TROY,had been made so huge for the express purpose of preventing its being
12781,THE FALL OF TROY,carried within the city; for Calchas the prophet had told them that if
12782,THE FALL OF TROY,"the Trojans took possession of it, they would assuredly triumph over"
12783,THE FALL OF TROY,the Greeks.

12785,THE FALL OF TROY,[Illustration: LAOCOÖN]
12786,THE FALL OF TROY,
12787,THE FALL OF TROY,=224. Laocoön and the Serpents.= This language turned the tide of the
12788,THE FALL OF TROY,"people's feelings, and they began to think how they might best secure"
12789,THE FALL OF TROY,"the monstrous horse and the favorable auguries connected with it,"
12790,THE FALL OF TROY,when suddenly a prodigy occurred which left no room for doubt. There
12791,THE FALL OF TROY,appeared advancing over the sea two immense serpents. They came upon
12792,THE FALL OF TROY,the land and the crowd fled in all directions. The serpents advanced
12793,THE FALL OF TROY,directly to the spot where Laocoön stood with his two sons. They
12794,THE FALL OF TROY,"first attacked the children, winding round their bodies and breathing"
12795,THE FALL OF TROY,"pestilential breath in their faces. The father, attempting to rescue"
12796,THE FALL OF TROY,"them, was next seized and involved in the serpent's coils."
12797,THE FALL OF TROY,
12798,THE FALL OF TROY,... Vain
12799,THE FALL OF TROY,"The struggle; vain, against the coiling strain"
12800,THE FALL OF TROY,"And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,"

12804,THE FALL OF TROY,
12805,THE FALL OF TROY,"He struggled to tear them away, but they overpowered all his efforts"
12806,THE FALL OF TROY,and strangled him and the children in their poisonous folds. The event
12807,THE FALL OF TROY,was regarded as a clear indication of the displeasure of the gods at
12808,THE FALL OF TROY,"Laocoön's irreverent treatment of the wooden horse, which they no"
12809,THE FALL OF TROY,longer hesitated to regard as a sacred object and prepared to introduce
12810,THE FALL OF TROY,with due solemnity into the city. They did so with songs and triumphal
12811,THE FALL OF TROY,"acclamations, and the day closed with festivity. In the night the"
12812,THE FALL OF TROY,"armed men who were inclosed in the body of the horse, being let out by"
12813,THE FALL OF TROY,"the traitor Sinon, opened the gates of the city to their friends who"
12814,THE FALL OF TROY,had returned under cover of the night. The city was set on fire; the
12815,THE FALL OF TROY,"people, overcome with feasting and sleep, were put to the sword, and"
12816,THE FALL OF TROY,Troy completely subdued.

12822,THE FALL OF TROY,=225. The Death of Priam.= Priam lived to see the downfall of his
12823,THE FALL OF TROY,kingdom and was slain at last on the fatal night when the Greeks
12824,THE FALL OF TROY,took the city. He had armed himself and was about to mingle with the
12825,THE FALL OF TROY,"combatants,[321] but was prevailed on by Hecuba to take refuge with"
12826,THE FALL OF TROY,his daughters and herself as a suppliant at the altar of Jupiter.
12827,THE FALL OF TROY,"While there, his youngest son, Polites, pursued by Pyrrhus, the son of"
12828,THE FALL OF TROY,"Achilles, rushed in wounded and expired at the feet of his father;"
12829,THE FALL OF TROY,"whereupon Priam, overcome with indignation, hurled his spear with"
12830,THE FALL OF TROY,feeble hand against Pyrrhus and was forthwith slain by him.

12836,THE FALL OF TROY,=226. The Survivors.=[322] Queen Hecuba and her daughter Cassandra were
12837,THE FALL OF TROY,"carried captives to Greece. Cassandra had been loved by Apollo, who"
12838,THE FALL OF TROY,"gave her the gift of prophecy; but afterwards offended with her, he had"
12839,THE FALL OF TROY,rendered the gift unavailing by ordaining that her predictions should
12840,THE FALL OF TROY,"never be believed. Polyxena, another daughter, who had been loved by"
12841,THE FALL OF TROY,"Achilles, was demanded by the ghost of that warrior and was sacrificed"
12842,THE FALL OF TROY,by the Greeks upon his tomb. Of the fate of the white-armed Andromache
12843,THE FALL OF TROY,"we have already spoken. She was carried off as the wife of Neoptolemus,"
12844,THE FALL OF TROY,but he was faithful to her for only a short time. After he had cast
12845,THE FALL OF TROY,"her aside she married Helenus, a brother of Hector, and still later"
12846,THE FALL OF TROY,returned to Asia Minor.
12847,THE FALL OF TROY,
12848,THE FALL OF TROY,"=227. Helen, Menelaüs, and Agamemnon.= On the fall of Troy, Menelaüs"
12849,THE FALL OF TROY,"recovered possession of his wife, who, it seems, had not ceased to"
12850,THE FALL OF TROY,"love him, though she had yielded to the might of Venus and deserted"
12851,THE FALL OF TROY,"him for another.[323] After the death of Paris, she aided the Greeks"
12852,THE FALL OF TROY,secretly on several occasions: in particular when Ulysses and Diomede
12853,THE FALL OF TROY,entered the city in disguise to carry off the Palladium. She then saw
12854,THE FALL OF TROY,"and recognized Ulysses, but kept the secret and even assisted them"
12855,THE FALL OF TROY,"in obtaining the image. Thus she became reconciled to Menelaüs, and"
12856,THE FALL OF TROY,they were among the first to leave the shores of Troy for their native
12857,THE FALL OF TROY,"land. But having incurred the displeasure of the gods, they were driven"
12858,THE FALL OF TROY,"by storms from shore to shore of the Mediterranean, visiting Cyprus,"
12859,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ph[oe]nicia, and Egypt. In Egypt they were kindly treated and presented"
12860,THE FALL OF TROY,"with rich gifts, of which Helen's share was a golden spindle and a"

12885,THE FALL OF TROY,Agamemnon[326] was not so fortunate in the issue. During his absence
12886,THE FALL OF TROY,his wife Clytemnestra had been false to him; and when his return was
12887,THE FALL OF TROY,"expected, she with her paramour, Ægisthus, son of Thyestes, laid a"

12895,THE FALL OF TROY,"slay his son Orestes also, a lad not yet old enough to be an object of"
12896,THE FALL OF TROY,"apprehension, but from whom, if he should be suffered to grow up, there"
12897,THE FALL OF TROY,"might be danger. Electra, the sister of Orestes, saved her brother's"
12898,THE FALL OF TROY,"life by sending him secretly to his uncle Strophius, king of Phocis. In"
12899,THE FALL OF TROY,"the palace of Strophius, Orestes grew up with the king's son Pylades,"
12900,THE FALL OF TROY,and formed with him a friendship which has become proverbial. Electra
12901,THE FALL OF TROY,frequently reminded her brother by messengers of the duty of avenging
12902,THE FALL OF TROY,"his father's death; he, too, when he reached maturity, consulted the"
12903,THE FALL OF TROY,"oracle of Delphi, which confirmed him in the design. He therefore"
12904,THE FALL OF TROY,"repaired in disguise to Argos, pretending to be a messenger from"
12905,THE FALL OF TROY,"Strophius, who would announce the death of Orestes. He brought with"
12906,THE FALL OF TROY,him what purported to be the ashes of the deceased in a funeral urn.
12907,THE FALL OF TROY,"After visiting his father's tomb and sacrificing upon it, according"
12908,THE FALL OF TROY,"to the rites of the ancients, he met by the way his sister Electra."
12909,THE FALL OF TROY,"Mistaking her for one of the domestics, and desirous of keeping his"
12910,THE FALL OF TROY,"arrival a secret till the hour of vengeance should arrive, he produced"
12911,THE FALL OF TROY,"the urn. At once his sister, believing Orestes to be really dead, took"
12912,THE FALL OF TROY,"the urn from him, and, embracing it, poured forth her grief in language"
12913,THE FALL OF TROY,"full of tenderness and despair. Soon a recognition was effected,"
12914,THE FALL OF TROY,"and the prince, with the aid of his sister, slew both Ægisthus and"

12922,THE FALL OF TROY,the breasts of the ancients the same abhorrence that it does in ours.
12923,THE FALL OF TROY,The Eumenides seized upon Orestes and drove him frantic from land to
12924,THE FALL OF TROY,land. In these wanderings Pylades accompanied him and watched over
12925,THE FALL OF TROY,"him. At length in answer to a second appeal to the oracle, Orestes"
12926,THE FALL OF TROY,was directed to go to the temple of the Tauri in Scythia and to bring
12927,THE FALL OF TROY,thence a statue of Diana which was believed to have fallen from heaven.
12928,THE FALL OF TROY,Accordingly the friends went to the Tauric Chersonese. Since there
12929,THE FALL OF TROY,the barbarous people were accustomed to sacrifice to the goddess all
12930,THE FALL OF TROY,"strangers who fell into their hands, the two friends were seized and"
12931,THE FALL OF TROY,carried bound to the temple to be made victims. But the priestess of
12932,THE FALL OF TROY,"Diana of the Tauri was no other than Iphigenia, the sister of Orestes,"
12933,THE FALL OF TROY,who had been snatched away by Diana at the moment when she was about to
12934,THE FALL OF TROY,"be sacrificed. Ascertaining from the prisoners who they were, Iphigenia"
12935,THE FALL OF TROY,disclosed herself to them; and the three made their escape with the

13036,GLADSTONE.],which drove them for nine days till they reached the country of the
13037,GLADSTONE.],"Lotos-eaters. Here, after watering, Ulysses sent three of his men"
13038,GLADSTONE.],to discover who the inhabitants were. These men on coming among the
13039,GLADSTONE.],Lotos-eaters were kindly entertained by them and were given some of
13040,GLADSTONE.],"their own food, the lotos plant, to eat. The effect of this food was"
13041,GLADSTONE.],such that those who partook of it lost all thought of home and wished

13097,GLADSTONE.],
13098,GLADSTONE.],=233. The Cyclopes.= They next arrived at the country of the Cyclopes.
13099,GLADSTONE.],The Cyclopes[333] inhabited an island of which they were the only
13100,GLADSTONE.],possessors. They dwelt in caves and fed on the wild productions of
13101,GLADSTONE.],"the island and on what their flocks yielded, for they were shepherds."
13102,GLADSTONE.],"Ulysses left the main body of his ships at anchor, and with one vessel"
13103,GLADSTONE.],went to the Cyclopes' island to explore for supplies. He landed with
13104,GLADSTONE.],"his companions, carrying with them a jar of wine for a present. Coming"
13105,GLADSTONE.],"to a large cave they entered it, and, finding no one within, examined"
13106,GLADSTONE.],"its contents. They found it stored with the riches of the flock,"
13107,GLADSTONE.],"quantities of cheese, pails and bowls of milk, lambs and kids in their"
13108,GLADSTONE.],"pens, all in good order. Presently arrived the master of the cave,"
13109,GLADSTONE.],"Polyphemus, bearing an immense bundle of firewood, which he threw"
13110,GLADSTONE.],down before the cavern's mouth. He then drove into the cave the sheep
13111,GLADSTONE.],"and goats to be milked, and, entering, rolled to the cave's mouth an"
13112,GLADSTONE.],"enormous rock, that twenty oxen could not draw. Next he sat down and"
13113,GLADSTONE.],"milked his ewes, preparing a part for cheese and setting the rest"
13114,GLADSTONE.],aside for his customary drink. Then turning round his one huge eye he
13115,GLADSTONE.],"discerned the strangers, and growled out at them, demanding who they"
13116,GLADSTONE.],"were and where from. Ulysses replied most humbly, stating that they"
13117,GLADSTONE.],were Greeks from the great expedition that had lately won so much
13118,GLADSTONE.],"glory in the conquest of Troy, that they were now on their way home,"
13119,GLADSTONE.],and finished by imploring his hospitality in the name of the gods.
13120,GLADSTONE.],"Polyphemus deigned no answer, but reaching out his hand seized two of"
13121,GLADSTONE.],"the men, whom he hurled against the side of the cave and dashed out"
13122,GLADSTONE.],"their brains. He proceeded to devour them with great relish, and having"
13123,GLADSTONE.],"made a hearty meal, stretched himself on the floor to sleep. Ulysses"
13124,GLADSTONE.],was tempted to seize the opportunity and plunge his sword into him as
13125,GLADSTONE.],"he slept, but recollected that it would only expose them all to certain"
13126,GLADSTONE.],"destruction, as the rock with which the giant had closed up the door"
13127,GLADSTONE.],"was far beyond their power to remove, and they would therefore be in"
13128,GLADSTONE.],hopeless imprisonment.
13129,GLADSTONE.],
13130,GLADSTONE.],Next morning the giant seized two more of the men and dispatched them
13131,GLADSTONE.],"in the same manner as their companions, feasting on their flesh till no"
13132,GLADSTONE.],"fragment was left. He then moved away the rock from the door, drove out"
13133,GLADSTONE.],"his flocks, and went out, carefully replacing the barrier after him."
13134,GLADSTONE.],When he was gone Ulysses planned how he might take vengeance for his
13135,GLADSTONE.],murdered friends and effect his escape with his surviving companions.
13136,GLADSTONE.],He made his men prepare a massive bar of wood cut by the Cyclops for
13137,GLADSTONE.],"a staff, which they found in the cave. They sharpened the end of the"
13138,GLADSTONE.],"staff and seasoned it in the fire, and hid it under the straw on the"
13139,GLADSTONE.],"cavern floor. Then four of the boldest were selected, with whom Ulysses"
13140,GLADSTONE.],"joined himself as a fifth. The Cyclops came home at evening, rolled"
13141,GLADSTONE.],"away the stone, and drove in his flock as usual. After milking them"
13142,GLADSTONE.],"and making his arrangements as before, he seized two more of Ulysses'"
13143,GLADSTONE.],"companions, dashed their brains out, and made his evening meal upon"
13144,GLADSTONE.],"them as he had on the others. After he had supped, Ulysses approaching"
13145,GLADSTONE.],"him handed him a bowl of wine, saying, ""Cyclops, this is wine; taste"
13146,GLADSTONE.],"and drink after thy meal of man's flesh."" He took and drank it, and was"
13147,GLADSTONE.],"hugely delighted with it, and called for more. Ulysses supplied him"
13148,GLADSTONE.],"once and again, which pleased the giant so much that he promised him as"
13149,GLADSTONE.],a favor that he should be the last of the party devoured. He asked his
13150,GLADSTONE.],"name, to which Ulysses replied, ""My name is Noman."""
13151,GLADSTONE.],
13152,GLADSTONE.],"After his supper the giant sought his repose, and was soon sound"
13153,GLADSTONE.],asleep. Then Ulysses with his four select friends held the end of the
13154,GLADSTONE.],"stake in the fire till it was one burning coal, then poising it exactly"
13155,GLADSTONE.],"above the giant's only eye, they plunged it deep into the socket,"
13156,GLADSTONE.],twirling it round as a carpenter does his auger. The howling monster
13157,GLADSTONE.],"with his outcry filled the cavern, and Ulysses with his aids nimbly got"
13158,GLADSTONE.],"out of his way and concealed themselves in the cave. He, bellowing,"
13159,GLADSTONE.],"called aloud on all the Cyclopes dwelling in the caves around him, far"
13160,GLADSTONE.],"and near. They, on his cry, flocked round the den, and inquired what"
13161,GLADSTONE.],grievous hurt had caused him to sound such an alarm and break their
13162,GLADSTONE.],"slumbers. He replied, ""O friends, I die, and Noman gives the blow."""
13163,GLADSTONE.],"They answered, ""If no man hurts thee, it is the stroke of Jove, and"
13164,GLADSTONE.],"thou must bear it."" So saying, they left him groaning."
13165,GLADSTONE.],
13166,GLADSTONE.],[Illustration: FIG. 171. BORING OUT THE CYCLOPS' EYE]
13167,GLADSTONE.],
13168,GLADSTONE.],Next morning the Cyclops rolled away the stone to let his flock out
13169,GLADSTONE.],"to pasture, but planted himself in the door of the cave to feel of"
13170,GLADSTONE.],"all as they went out, that Ulysses and his men should not escape with"
13171,GLADSTONE.],them. But Ulysses had made his men harness the rams of the flock
13172,GLADSTONE.],"three abreast, with osiers which they found on the floor of the cave."
13173,GLADSTONE.],"To the middle ram of the three one of the Greeks suspended himself,"
13174,GLADSTONE.],"so protected by the exterior rams on either side. As they passed,"
13175,GLADSTONE.],"the giant felt of the animals' backs and sides, but never thought"
13176,GLADSTONE.],"of their bellies; so the men all passed safe, Ulysses himself being"
13177,GLADSTONE.],on the last one that passed. When they had got a few paces from the
13178,GLADSTONE.],"cavern, Ulysses and his friends released themselves from their rams"
13179,GLADSTONE.],and drove a good part of the flock down to the shore to their boat.
13180,GLADSTONE.],"They put them aboard with all haste, then pushed off from the shore;"
13181,GLADSTONE.],"and when at a safe distance Ulysses shouted out, ""Cyclops, the gods"
13182,GLADSTONE.],have well requited thee for thy atrocious deeds. Know it is Ulysses
13183,GLADSTONE.],"to whom thou owest thy shameful loss of sight."" The Cyclops, hearing"
13184,GLADSTONE.],"this, seized a rock that projected from the side of the mountain, and"
13185,GLADSTONE.],"rending it from its bed, he lifted it high in the air, then exerting"
13186,GLADSTONE.],"all his force, hurled it in the direction of the voice. Down came the"
13187,GLADSTONE.],"mass, just forward of the vessel. The ocean, at the plunge of the huge"
13188,GLADSTONE.],"rock, heaved the ship toward Polyphemus; but a second rock which he"
13189,GLADSTONE.],"hurled, striking aft, propelled them fortunately in the direction that"
13190,GLADSTONE.],"they desired to take. Ulysses was about to hail the giant again, but"
13191,GLADSTONE.],"his friends besought him not to do so. He could not forbear, however,"
13192,GLADSTONE.],"letting the giant know that they had escaped his missile, but waited"
13193,GLADSTONE.],till they had reached a safer distance than before. The giant answered
13194,GLADSTONE.],"them with curses, while Ulysses and his friends, plying their oars"
13195,GLADSTONE.],"vigorously, regained their companions."

13198,GLADSTONE.],
13199,GLADSTONE.],=234. The Bag of Winds.= Ulysses next arrived at the island of
13200,GLADSTONE.],"Æolus.[334] He treated Ulysses hospitably, and at his departure gave"
13201,GLADSTONE.],"him, tied up in a leathern bag with a silver string, such winds as"
13202,GLADSTONE.],"might be hurtful and dangerous, commanding fair winds to blow the barks"
13203,GLADSTONE.],"toward their country. Nine days they sped before the wind, and all"
13204,GLADSTONE.],that time Ulysses had stood at the helm without sleep. At last quite
13205,GLADSTONE.],"exhausted he lay down to sleep. While he slept, the crew conferred"
13206,GLADSTONE.],"together about the mysterious bag, and concluded it must contain"
13207,GLADSTONE.],treasures given by the hospitable King Æolus to their commander.
13208,GLADSTONE.],"Tempted to secure some portion for themselves, they loosed the string,"
13209,GLADSTONE.],when immediately the winds rushed forth. The ships were driven far from
13210,GLADSTONE.],"their course and back again to the island they had just left. Æolus,"
13211,GLADSTONE.],"indignant at their folly, refused to assist them further, and they were"
13212,GLADSTONE.],obliged to labor over their course once more by means of their oars.
13213,GLADSTONE.],
13214,GLADSTONE.],=235. The Læstrygonians.= Their next adventure was with the barbarous
13215,GLADSTONE.],"tribe of Læstrygonians. The vessels all pushed into the harbor, tempted"
13216,GLADSTONE.],"by the secure appearance of the cove, completely landlocked; only"
13217,GLADSTONE.],Ulysses moored his vessel without. As soon as the Læstrygonians found
13218,GLADSTONE.],"the ships completely in their power, they attacked them, heaving huge"
13219,GLADSTONE.],"stones which broke and overturned them, while with their spears they"
13220,GLADSTONE.],dispatched the seamen as they struggled in the water. All the vessels
13221,GLADSTONE.],"with their crews were destroyed, except Ulysses' own ship which had"
13222,GLADSTONE.],"remained outside. He, finding no safety but in flight, exhorted his men"
13223,GLADSTONE.],to ply their oars vigorously; and they escaped.
13224,GLADSTONE.],
13225,GLADSTONE.],=236. The Isle of Ææa.= With grief for their slain companions mixed
13226,GLADSTONE.],"with joy at their own escape, they pursued their way till they arrived"
13227,GLADSTONE.],"at the Ææan isle, where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the sun. Landing"
13228,GLADSTONE.],"here, Ulysses climbed a hill and, gazing round, saw no signs of"
13229,GLADSTONE.],"habitation except in one spot at the center of the island, where he"
13230,GLADSTONE.],perceived a palace embowered with trees. He sent forward one half of
13231,GLADSTONE.],"his crew, under the command of Eurylochus, to see what prospect of"
13232,GLADSTONE.],"hospitality they might find. As they approached the palace, they found"
13233,GLADSTONE.],"themselves surrounded by lions, tigers, and wolves, not fierce, but"
13234,GLADSTONE.],"tamed by Circe's art, for she was a powerful magician. These animals"
13235,GLADSTONE.],"had once been men, but had been changed by Circe's enchantments into"
13236,GLADSTONE.],"the forms of beasts. The sounds of soft music were heard from within,"
13237,GLADSTONE.],"and a sweet female voice singing. Eurylochus called aloud, and the"
13238,GLADSTONE.],goddess came forth and invited them in; they all gladly entered except
13239,GLADSTONE.],"Eurylochus, who suspected danger. The goddess conducted her guests to"
13240,GLADSTONE.],"a seat, and had them served with wine and other delicacies. When they"
13241,GLADSTONE.],"had feasted heartily, she touched them one by one with her wand, and"
13242,GLADSTONE.],"they became immediately changed into swine, in ""head, body, voice, and"
13243,GLADSTONE.],"bristles,"" yet with their intellects as before. She shut them in her"
13244,GLADSTONE.],styes and supplied them with acorns and such other things as swine
13245,GLADSTONE.],love.
13246,GLADSTONE.],
13247,GLADSTONE.],Eurylochus hurried back to the ship and told the tale. Ulysses
13248,GLADSTONE.],thereupon determined to go himself and try if by any means he might
13249,GLADSTONE.],"deliver his companions. As he strode onward alone, he met a youth"
13250,GLADSTONE.],"who addressed him familiarly, appearing to be acquainted with his"
13251,GLADSTONE.],"adventures. He announced himself as Mercury, and informed Ulysses of"
13252,GLADSTONE.],the arts of Circe and of the danger of approaching her. As Ulysses
13253,GLADSTONE.],"was not to be dissuaded from his attempt, Mercury provided him with a"
13254,GLADSTONE.],"sprig of the plant Moly, of wonderful power to resist sorceries, and"
13255,GLADSTONE.],instructed him how to act.
13256,GLADSTONE.],
13257,GLADSTONE.],[Illustration: FIG. 173. THE CASTLE OF CIRCE]
13258,GLADSTONE.],
13259,GLADSTONE.],Meanwhile the companions of Ulysses made mournful plaint to their cruel
13260,GLADSTONE.],mistress:
13261,GLADSTONE.],
13262,GLADSTONE.],"Huddling they came, with shag sides caked of mire,--"
13263,GLADSTONE.],"With hoofs fresh sullied from the troughs o'er-turned,--"
13264,GLADSTONE.],"With wrinkling snouts,--yet eyes in which desire"
13265,GLADSTONE.],"Of some strange thing unutterably burned,"
13266,GLADSTONE.],Unquenchable; and still where'er She turned
13267,GLADSTONE.],"They rose about her, striving each o'er each,"
13268,GLADSTONE.],"With restless, fierce importuning that yearned"
13269,GLADSTONE.],"Through those brute masks some piteous tale to teach,"
13270,GLADSTONE.],"Yet lacked the words thereto, denied the power of speech...."
13271,GLADSTONE.],
13272,GLADSTONE.],"... ""If swine we be,--if we indeed be swine,"
13273,GLADSTONE.],"Daughter of Persé, make us swine indeed,"
13274,GLADSTONE.],"Well-pleased on litter-straw to lie supine,--"
13275,GLADSTONE.],"Well-pleased on mast and acorn-shales to feed,"
13276,GLADSTONE.],Stirred by all instincts of the bestial breed;
13277,GLADSTONE.],But O Unmerciful! O Pitiless!
13278,GLADSTONE.],Leave us not thus with sick men's hearts to bleed!--
13279,GLADSTONE.],"To waste long days in yearning, dumb distress,"
13280,GLADSTONE.],"And memory of things gone, and utter hopelessness!"
13281,GLADSTONE.],
13282,GLADSTONE.],"... ""Make thou us men again,--if men but groping"
13283,GLADSTONE.],That dark Hereafter which th' Olympians keep;
13284,GLADSTONE.],"Make thou us men again,--if men but hoping"
13285,GLADSTONE.],Behind death's doors security of sleep;--
13286,GLADSTONE.],"For yet to laugh is somewhat, and to sleep;--"
13287,GLADSTONE.],"To feel delight of living, and to plow"
13288,GLADSTONE.],The salt-blown acres of the shoreless deep;--
13289,GLADSTONE.],"Better,--yea better far all these than bow"
13290,GLADSTONE.],"Foul faces to foul earth, and yearn--as we do now!"""
13291,GLADSTONE.],
13292,GLADSTONE.],"So they in speech unsyllabled. But She,"
13293,GLADSTONE.],"The fair-tressed Goddess, born to be their bane,"
13294,GLADSTONE.],"Uplifting straight her wand of ivory,"
13295,GLADSTONE.],Compelled them groaning to the styes again;
13296,GLADSTONE.],Where they in hopeless bitterness were fain
13297,GLADSTONE.],"To rend the oaken woodwork as before,"
13298,GLADSTONE.],"And tear the troughs in impotence of pain,--"
13299,GLADSTONE.],"Not knowing, they, that even at the door"
13300,GLADSTONE.],"Divine Odysseus stood,--as Hermes told of yore.[335]"
13301,GLADSTONE.],
13302,GLADSTONE.],"Ulysses, reaching the palace, was courteously received by Circe, who"
13303,GLADSTONE.],"entertained him as she had done his companions, but after he had eaten"
13304,GLADSTONE.],"and drunk, touched him with her wand, saying, ""Hence, seek the stye and"
13305,GLADSTONE.],"wallow with thy friends."" But he, instead of obeying, drew his sword"
13306,GLADSTONE.],and rushed upon her with fury in his countenance. She fell on her knees
13307,GLADSTONE.],and begged for mercy.
13308,GLADSTONE.],
13309,GLADSTONE.],He dictated a solemn oath that she would release his companions and
13310,GLADSTONE.],"practice no further harm against him or them; and she repeated it, at"
13311,GLADSTONE.],the same time promising to dismiss them all in safety after hospitably
13312,GLADSTONE.],entertaining them. She was as good as her word. The men were restored
13313,GLADSTONE.],"to their shapes, the rest of the crew summoned from the shore, and"
13314,GLADSTONE.],"all magnificently entertained day after day, till Ulysses seemed to"
13315,GLADSTONE.],have forgotten his native land and to have reconciled himself to an
13316,GLADSTONE.],inglorious life of ease and pleasure.
13317,GLADSTONE.],
13318,GLADSTONE.],=237. Ulysses visits Hades.= At length his companions recalled him to
13319,GLADSTONE.],"nobler sentiments, and he received their admonition gratefully. Circe,"
13320,GLADSTONE.],"won over by his prayers, consented to send him on his homeward way. But"
13321,GLADSTONE.],"she warned him that first he must perform another journey, must visit"
13322,GLADSTONE.],"the Underworld and there learn from the shade of Tiresias, the blind"
13323,GLADSTONE.],"prophet of Thebes, the way and measure of his path, and how to proceed"
13324,GLADSTONE.],to Ithaca over the teeming deep.
13325,GLADSTONE.],
13326,GLADSTONE.],"""But who will guide us?"" queried Ulysses in amaze; ""for no man ever yet"
13327,GLADSTONE.],"sailed to hell in a black ship."""
13328,GLADSTONE.],
13329,GLADSTONE.],"""Son of Laërtes,"" replied the Goddess, ""Ulysses of many devices, nay,"
13330,GLADSTONE.],"trouble not thyself for want of a guide, by thy ship abiding, but set"
13331,GLADSTONE.],up the mast and spread abroad the white sails and sit thee down; and
13332,GLADSTONE.],the breeze of the North Wind will bear thy vessel on her way. But when
13333,GLADSTONE.],thou hast now sailed in thy ship across the stream Oceanus where is a
13334,GLADSTONE.],"waste shore and the groves of Persephone, even tall poplar trees and"
13335,GLADSTONE.],"willows that shed their fruit before the season, there beach thy ship"
13336,GLADSTONE.],"by deep-eddying Oceanus, but go thyself to the dank house of Hades."
13337,GLADSTONE.],"Thereby into Acheron flows Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus, a branch of"
13338,GLADSTONE.],"the water of the Styx; and there is a rock, and the meeting of the two"
13339,GLADSTONE.],roaring waters. There dig a trench and pour a drink offering to all the
13340,GLADSTONE.],"dead, mead and sweet wine and water, sprinkling white meal thereon. And"
13341,GLADSTONE.],"when thou hast prayed to them, offer up a ram and a black ewe. Then"
13342,GLADSTONE.],will many spirits come to thee of the dead that be departed; but thou
13343,GLADSTONE.],"shalt draw thy sharp sword and suffer them not to approach the blood,"
13344,GLADSTONE.],"ere thou hast word of Tiresias.""[336]"
13345,GLADSTONE.],
13346,GLADSTONE.],So Ulysses and his companions did as they were bid. And the ship came
13347,GLADSTONE.],"to the limits of the world, to the deep-flowing Oceanus. There is the"
13348,GLADSTONE.],"land and city of the Cimmerians, where no ray of sunshine ever falls,"
13349,GLADSTONE.],but deadly night is outspread over miserable mortals. And there Ulysses
13350,GLADSTONE.],and those with him performed the drink offering and the prayer and
13351,GLADSTONE.],the sacrifice; and Ulysses fended off the spirits of the dead from
13352,GLADSTONE.],"the blood until the soul of the Theban prophet arrived. And that one,"
13353,GLADSTONE.],"having drunk of the dark blood, declared unto Ulysses the future of his"
13354,GLADSTONE.],"way: how the Earthshaker, god of the waters, should oppose him, but"
13355,GLADSTONE.],"how he should win home without further disaster if, when passing the"
13356,GLADSTONE.],"isle Thrinacia, he would but restrain the spirit of his men so that"
13357,GLADSTONE.],"they should do no injury to the cattle of the Sun grazing thereon. If,"
13358,GLADSTONE.],"however, these cattle were not respected but hurt, then there should"
13359,GLADSTONE.],follow ruin for both ship and men; and Ulysses himself on the ship
13360,GLADSTONE.],"of strangers should return late in time to his home, to find sorrows"
13361,GLADSTONE.],"there, proud men wasting his patrimony and wooing his godlike wife"
13362,GLADSTONE.],"to wed her. But that he should avenge their violence, and settle his"
13363,GLADSTONE.],"affairs at home, and then betake himself again to wandering; and that"
13364,GLADSTONE.],"from the sea should his own death come,--""the gentlest death that may"
13365,GLADSTONE.],"be, which shall end thee fordone with smooth old age; and the folk"
13366,GLADSTONE.],"shall dwell happily around thee."""
13367,GLADSTONE.],
13368,GLADSTONE.],"In the land of Hades, Ulysses saw also the shade of his mother, and"
13369,GLADSTONE.],"spoke with her of his father and of Penelope, his wife, and of his"
13370,GLADSTONE.],son Telemachus. And he saw also the shades of Antiope and Alcmene and
13371,GLADSTONE.],"Phædra and Procris; and of Agamemnon, and Achilles, and Ajax, the son"
13372,GLADSTONE.],"of Telamon, and of many others, and spoke with them of their own fates"
13373,GLADSTONE.],and of the affairs of the upper world.
13374,GLADSTONE.],
13375,GLADSTONE.],"=238. The Sirens.= Returning from the abode of the shades, Ulysses"
13376,GLADSTONE.],revisited the Ææan isle and recounted to Circe his adventures and
13377,GLADSTONE.],the wondrous visions and the laws of Hell. She in return speeded his
13378,GLADSTONE.],"homeward voyage, instructing him particularly how to pass safely by the"
13379,GLADSTONE.],coast of the Sirens.[337]
13380,GLADSTONE.],
13381,GLADSTONE.],"These nymphs had the power, as has been already said, of charming by"
13382,GLADSTONE.],"their song all who heard them, so that mariners were impelled to cast"
13383,GLADSTONE.],themselves into the sea to destruction. Circe directed Ulysses to stop
13384,GLADSTONE.],"the ears of his seamen with wax, so that they should not hear the"
13385,GLADSTONE.],"strain; to have himself bound to the mast, and to enjoin his people,"
13386,GLADSTONE.],"whatever he might say or do, by no means to release him till they"
13387,GLADSTONE.],should have passed the Sirens' island. Ulysses obeyed these directions.
13388,GLADSTONE.],"As they approached the Sirens' island, the sea was calm, and over the"
13389,GLADSTONE.],waters came notes of music so ravishing and attractive that Ulysses
13390,GLADSTONE.],"struggled to get loose and, by cries and signs to his people, begged"
13391,GLADSTONE.],"to be released; but they, obedient to his previous orders, sprang"
13392,GLADSTONE.],"forward and bound him still faster. They held on their course, and the"
13393,GLADSTONE.],"music grew fainter till it ceased to be heard, when with joy Ulysses"
13394,GLADSTONE.],gave his companions the signal to unseal their ears; and they relieved
13395,GLADSTONE.],"him from his bonds. It is said that one of the Sirens, Parthenope, in"
13396,GLADSTONE.],grief at the escape of Ulysses drowned herself. Her body was cast up on
13397,GLADSTONE.],"the Italian shore where now stands the city of Naples, in early times"
13398,GLADSTONE.],called by the Siren's name.
13399,GLADSTONE.],
13400,GLADSTONE.],[Illustration: FIG. 174. ULYSSES AND THE SIRENS]
13401,GLADSTONE.],
13402,GLADSTONE.],=239. Scylla and Charybdis.= Ulysses had been warned by Circe of the
13403,GLADSTONE.],two monsters Scylla and Charybdis. We have already met with Scylla in
13404,GLADSTONE.],"the myth of Glaucus. She dwelt in a cave high up on the cliff, from"
13405,GLADSTONE.],whence she was accustomed to thrust forth her long necks (for she had
13406,GLADSTONE.],"six heads), and in each of her mouths to seize one of the crew of every"
13407,GLADSTONE.],"vessel passing within reach. The other terror, Charybdis, was a gulf"
13408,GLADSTONE.],nearly on a level with the water. Thrice each day the water rushed
13409,GLADSTONE.],"into a frightful chasm, and thrice was disgorged. Any vessel coming"
13410,GLADSTONE.],near the whirlpool when the tide was rushing in must inevitably be
13411,GLADSTONE.],engulfed; not Neptune himself could save it. On approaching the haunt
13412,GLADSTONE.],"of the dread monsters, Ulysses kept strict watch to discover them."
13413,GLADSTONE.],The roar of the waters as Charybdis engulfed them gave warning at a
13414,GLADSTONE.],"distance, but Scylla could nowhere be discerned. While Ulysses and his"
13415,GLADSTONE.],"men watched with anxious eyes the dreadful whirlpool, they were not"
13416,GLADSTONE.],"equally on their guard from the attack of Scylla,[338] and the monster,"
13417,GLADSTONE.],"darting forth her snaky heads, caught six of his men and bore them away"
13418,GLADSTONE.],shrieking to her den. Ulysses was unable to afford any assistance.
13419,GLADSTONE.],
13420,GLADSTONE.],[Illustration: FIG. 175. ULYSSES AND SCYLLA]
13421,GLADSTONE.],
13422,GLADSTONE.],=240. The Cattle of the Sun.= Both Tiresias and Circe had warned him
13423,GLADSTONE.],of another danger. After passing Scylla and Charybdis the next land he
13424,GLADSTONE.],"would make was Thrinacia, an island whereon were pastured the cattle"
13425,GLADSTONE.],"of Helios, the Sun, tended by his daughters Lampetia and Phaëthusa."
13426,GLADSTONE.],"These flocks must not be violated, whatever the wants of the voyagers"
13427,GLADSTONE.],"might be. If this injunction were transgressed, destruction was sure to"
13428,GLADSTONE.],fall on the offenders. Ulysses would willingly have passed the island
13429,GLADSTONE.],"of the Sun without stopping, but his companions so urgently pleaded"
13430,GLADSTONE.],for the rest and refreshment that would be derived from anchoring and
13431,GLADSTONE.],"passing the night on shore, that Ulysses yielded. He made them swear,"
13432,GLADSTONE.],"however, not to touch the sacred flocks and herds, but to content"
13433,GLADSTONE.],themselves with what provision they yet had left of the supply which
13434,GLADSTONE.],Circe had put on board. So long as this supply lasted the people kept
13435,GLADSTONE.],"their oath; but contrary winds detained them at the island for a month,"
13436,GLADSTONE.],"and after consuming all their stock of provisions, they were forced to"
13437,GLADSTONE.],"rely upon the birds and fishes they could catch. Famine pressed them,"
13438,GLADSTONE.],"and at last, in the absence of Ulysses, they slew some of the cattle,"
13439,GLADSTONE.],vainly attempting to make amends for the deed by offering from them a
13440,GLADSTONE.],"portion to the offended powers. Ulysses, on his return to the shore,"
13441,GLADSTONE.],"was horror-struck at perceiving what they had done, and the more so on"
13442,GLADSTONE.],account of the portentous signs which followed. The skins crept on the
13443,GLADSTONE.],"ground, and the joints of meat lowed on the spits while roasting."
13444,GLADSTONE.],
13445,GLADSTONE.],[Illustration: FLYING MERCURY]
13446,GLADSTONE.],
13447,GLADSTONE.],"The wind becoming fair, they sailed from the island. They had not gone"
13448,GLADSTONE.],"far when the weather changed, and a storm of thunder and lightning"
13449,GLADSTONE.],"ensued. A stroke of lightning shattered their mast, which in its fall"
13450,GLADSTONE.],killed the pilot. At last the vessel itself went to pieces. The keel
13451,GLADSTONE.],"and mast floating side by side, Ulysses formed of them a raft to which"
13452,GLADSTONE.],"he clung; and, the wind changing, the waves bore him to Calypso's"
13453,GLADSTONE.],island. All the rest of the crew perished.
13454,GLADSTONE.],
13455,GLADSTONE.],"=241. Calypso's Island.= Calypso, a sea-nymph, received Ulysses"
13456,GLADSTONE.],"hospitably, entertained him magnificently, became enamored of him, and"
13457,GLADSTONE.],"wished to retain him forever, offering him immortality. He remained"
13458,GLADSTONE.],with her seven long years. But he persisted in his resolution to return
13459,GLADSTONE.],to his country and his wife and son.[339] Calypso at last received the
13460,GLADSTONE.],command of Jove to dismiss him. Mercury brought the message to her and
13461,GLADSTONE.],found her in her grotto.
13462,GLADSTONE.],
13463,GLADSTONE.],"A garden vine, luxuriant on all sides,"
13464,GLADSTONE.],"Mantled the spacious cavern, cluster-hung"
13465,GLADSTONE.],"Profuse; four fountains of serenest lymph,"
13466,GLADSTONE.],"Their sinuous course pursuing side by side,"
13467,GLADSTONE.],"Strayed all around, and everywhere appeared"
13468,GLADSTONE.],"Meadows of softest verdure, purpled o'er"
13469,GLADSTONE.],With violets; it was a scene to fill
13470,GLADSTONE.],A god from heaven with wonder and delight.[340]
13471,GLADSTONE.],
13472,GLADSTONE.],"Calypso, with much reluctance, proceeded to obey the commands of"
13473,GLADSTONE.],"Jupiter. She supplied Ulysses with the means of constructing a raft,"
13474,GLADSTONE.],"provisioned it well for him, and gave him a favoring gale. He sped on"
13475,GLADSTONE.],"his course prosperously for many days, till at last, when in sight of"
13476,GLADSTONE.],"land, a storm arose that broke his mast and threatened to rend the"
13477,GLADSTONE.],"raft asunder. In this crisis he was seen by a compassionate sea-nymph,"
13478,GLADSTONE.],"Leucothea, who, in the form of a cormorant, alighted on the raft and"
13479,GLADSTONE.],"presented him with a girdle, directing him to bind it beneath his"
13480,GLADSTONE.],"breast, that, if he should be compelled to trust himself to the waves,"
13481,GLADSTONE.],it might buoy him up and enable him to reach the land.
13482,GLADSTONE.],
13483,GLADSTONE.],=242. The Land of the Phæacians.= Ulysses clung to the raft so long as
13484,GLADSTONE.],"its timbers held together, and when it no longer yielded him support,"
13485,GLADSTONE.],"binding the girdle around him, he swam. Minerva smoothed the billows"
13486,GLADSTONE.],before him and sent him a wind that rolled the waves towards the shore.
13487,GLADSTONE.],The surf beat high on the rocks and seemed to forbid approach; but at
13488,GLADSTONE.],"length finding calm water at the mouth of a gentle stream, he landed,"
13489,GLADSTONE.],"spent with toil, breathless and speechless and almost dead. Reviving"
13490,GLADSTONE.],"after some time, he kissed the soil, rejoicing, yet at a loss what"
13491,GLADSTONE.],"course to take. At a short distance he perceived a wood, to which he"
13492,GLADSTONE.],turned his steps. There finding a covert sheltered by intermingling
13493,GLADSTONE.],"branches alike from the sun and the rain, he collected a pile of leaves"
13494,GLADSTONE.],"and formed a bed, on which he stretched himself, and, heaping the"
13495,GLADSTONE.],"leaves over him, fell asleep."
13496,GLADSTONE.],
13497,GLADSTONE.],"The land where he was thrown was Scheria, the country of the"
13498,GLADSTONE.],"Phæacians.[341] These people dwelt originally near the Cyclopes; but,"
13499,GLADSTONE.],"being oppressed by that savage race, they migrated to the isle of"
13500,GLADSTONE.],"Scheria under the conduct of Nausithoüs, their king. They were, the"
13501,GLADSTONE.],"poet tells us, a people akin to the gods, who appeared manifestly and"
13502,GLADSTONE.],"feasted among them when they offered sacrifices, and did not conceal"
13503,GLADSTONE.],themselves from solitary wayfarers when they met them. They had
13504,GLADSTONE.],abundance of wealth and lived in the enjoyment of it undisturbed by
13505,GLADSTONE.],"the alarms of war; for as they dwelt remote from gain-seeking man, no"
13506,GLADSTONE.],"enemy ever approached their shores, and they did not even require to"
13507,GLADSTONE.],make use of bows and quivers. Their chief employment was navigation.
13508,GLADSTONE.],"Their ships, which went with the velocity of birds, were endued with"
13509,GLADSTONE.],"intelligence; they knew every port and needed no pilot. Alcinoüs, the"
13510,GLADSTONE.],"son of Nausithoüs, was now their king, a wise and just sovereign,"
13511,GLADSTONE.],beloved by his people.
13512,GLADSTONE.],
13513,GLADSTONE.],Now it happened that the very night on which Ulysses was cast ashore on
13514,GLADSTONE.],"the Phæacian island, and while he lay sleeping on his bed of leaves,"
13515,GLADSTONE.],"Nausicaa, the daughter of the king, had a dream sent by Minerva,"
13516,GLADSTONE.],"reminding her that her wedding day might not be far distant, and that"
13517,GLADSTONE.],it would be but a prudent preparation for that event to have a general
13518,GLADSTONE.],washing of the clothes of the family.
13519,GLADSTONE.],
13520,GLADSTONE.],"This was no slight affair, for the fountains were at some distance and"
13521,GLADSTONE.],"the garments must be carried thither. On awaking, the princess hastened"
13522,GLADSTONE.],"to her parents to tell them what was on her mind,--not alluding to"
13523,GLADSTONE.],"her wedding day, but finding other reasons equally good. Her father"
13524,GLADSTONE.],readily assented and ordered the grooms to furnish forth a wagon for
13525,GLADSTONE.],"the purpose. The clothes were put therein, and the queen, her mother,"
13526,GLADSTONE.],placed in the wagon likewise an abundant supply of food and wine.
13527,GLADSTONE.],"The princess took her seat and plied the lash, her attendant virgins"
13528,GLADSTONE.],following her on foot. Arrived at the riverside they turned out the
13529,GLADSTONE.],"mules to graze, and unlading the carriage, bore the garments down to"
13530,GLADSTONE.],"the water, and, working with cheerfulness and alacrity, soon dispatched"
13531,GLADSTONE.],"their labor. Then having spread the garments on the shore to dry, and"
13532,GLADSTONE.],"having themselves bathed, they sat down to enjoy their meal; after"
13533,GLADSTONE.],"which they rose and amused themselves with a game of ball, the princess"
13534,GLADSTONE.],singing to them while they played. But when they had refolded the
13535,GLADSTONE.],"apparel and were about to resume their way to the town, Minerva caused"
13536,GLADSTONE.],"the ball thrown by the princess to fall into the water, whereat they"
13537,GLADSTONE.],"all screamed, and Ulysses awaked at the sound."
13538,GLADSTONE.],
13539,GLADSTONE.],"Utterly destitute of clothing, he discovered that only a few bushes"
13540,GLADSTONE.],"were interposed between him and a group of young maidens, whom, by"
13541,GLADSTONE.],"their deportment and attire, he discovered to be not mere peasant"
13542,GLADSTONE.],"girls, but of a higher class. Breaking off a leafy branch from a tree,"
13543,GLADSTONE.],he held it before him and stepped out from the thicket. The virgins
13544,GLADSTONE.],"at sight of him fled in all directions, Nausicaa alone excepted, for"
13545,GLADSTONE.],"her Minerva aided and endowed with courage and discernment. Ulysses,"
13546,GLADSTONE.],"standing respectfully aloof, told his sad case, and besought the fair"
13547,GLADSTONE.],object (whether queen or goddess he professed he knew not) for food and
13548,GLADSTONE.],"clothing. The princess replied courteously, promising present relief"
13549,GLADSTONE.],and her father's hospitality when he should become acquainted with the
13550,GLADSTONE.],"facts. She called back her scattered maidens, chiding their alarm and"
13551,GLADSTONE.],"reminding them that the Phæacians had no enemies to fear. This man,"
13552,GLADSTONE.],"she told them, was an unhappy wanderer, whom it was a duty to cherish,"
13553,GLADSTONE.],"for the poor and the stranger are from Jove. She bade them bring food,"
13554,GLADSTONE.],and the garments of some of her brothers that were among the contents
13555,GLADSTONE.],"of the wagon. When this was done, and Ulysses retiring to a sheltered"
13556,GLADSTONE.],"place had washed his body free from the sea-foam, and clothed himself,"
13557,GLADSTONE.],"and eaten, Pallas dilated his form and diffused grace over his ample"
13558,GLADSTONE.],chest and manly brows.
13559,GLADSTONE.],
13560,GLADSTONE.],"The princess, seeing him, was filled with admiration and scrupled not"
13561,GLADSTONE.],to say to her damsels that she wished the gods would send her such
13562,GLADSTONE.],"a husband. To Ulysses she recommended that he repair to the city,"
13563,GLADSTONE.],following herself and her train so far as the way lay through the
13564,GLADSTONE.],"fields; but when they should approach the city, she desired that he no"
13565,GLADSTONE.],"longer be seen in her company, for she feared the remarks which rude"
13566,GLADSTONE.],and vulgar people might make on seeing her return accompanied by such
13567,GLADSTONE.],a gallant stranger. To avoid this she directed him to stop at a grove
13568,GLADSTONE.],"adjoining the city, in which were a farm and garden belonging to the"
13569,GLADSTONE.],king. After allowing time for the princess and her companions to reach
13570,GLADSTONE.],"the city, he was then to pursue his way thither, and should be easily"
13571,GLADSTONE.],guided by any he might meet to the royal abode.
13572,GLADSTONE.],
13573,GLADSTONE.],"Ulysses obeyed the directions and in due time proceeded to the city,"
13574,GLADSTONE.],on approaching which he met a young woman bearing forth a pitcher for
13575,GLADSTONE.],water.[342] It was Minerva who had assumed that form. Ulysses accosted
13576,GLADSTONE.],"her and desired to be directed to the palace of Alcinoüs, the king. The"
13577,GLADSTONE.],"maiden replied respectfully, offering to be his guide; for the palace,"
13578,GLADSTONE.],"she informed him, stood near her father's dwelling. Under the guidance"
13579,GLADSTONE.],"of the goddess and, by her power, enveloped in a cloud which shielded"
13580,GLADSTONE.],"him from observation, Ulysses passed among the busy crowd and with"
13581,GLADSTONE.],"wonder observed their harbor, their ships, their forum (the resort of"
13582,GLADSTONE.],"heroes), and their battlements, till they came to the palace, where"
13583,GLADSTONE.],"the goddess, having first given him some information of the country,"
13584,GLADSTONE.],"king, and people he was about to meet, left him. Ulysses, before"
13585,GLADSTONE.],"entering the courtyard of the palace, stood and surveyed the scene. Its"
13586,GLADSTONE.],splendor astonished him. Brazen walls stretched from the entrance to
13587,GLADSTONE.],"the interior house, of which the doors were gold, the doorposts silver,"
13588,GLADSTONE.],the lintels silver ornamented with gold. On either side were figures of
13589,GLADSTONE.],"mastiffs wrought in gold and silver, standing in rows as if to guard"
13590,GLADSTONE.],the approach. Along the walls were seats spread through all their
13591,GLADSTONE.],"length with mantles of finest texture, the work of Phæacian maidens."
13592,GLADSTONE.],"On these seats the princes sat and feasted, while golden statues of"
13593,GLADSTONE.],graceful youths held in their hands lighted torches which shed radiance
13594,GLADSTONE.],"over the scene. Full fifty female menials served in household offices,"
13595,GLADSTONE.],"some employed to grind the corn, others to wind off the purple wool or"
13596,GLADSTONE.],ply the loom. For the Phæacian women as far exceeded all other women in
13597,GLADSTONE.],household arts as the mariners of that country did the rest of mankind
13598,GLADSTONE.],"in the management of ships. Without the court a spacious garden lay,"
13599,GLADSTONE.],"four acres in extent. In it grew many a lofty tree, pomegranate, pear,"
13600,GLADSTONE.],"apple, fig, and olive. Neither winter's cold nor summer's drought"
13601,GLADSTONE.],arrested their growth.
13602,GLADSTONE.],
13603,GLADSTONE.],"The languid sunset, mother of roses,[343]"
13604,GLADSTONE.],"Lingers, a light on the magic seas,"
13605,GLADSTONE.],"The wide fire flames, as a flower uncloses,"
13606,GLADSTONE.],"Heavy with odor, and loose to the breeze."
13607,GLADSTONE.],
13608,GLADSTONE.],"The red rose clouds, without law or leader,"
13609,GLADSTONE.],Gather and float in the airy plain;
13610,GLADSTONE.],"The nightingale sings to the dewy cedar,"
13611,GLADSTONE.],The cedar scatters his scent to the main.
13612,GLADSTONE.],
13613,GLADSTONE.],"The strange flowers' perfume turns to singing,"
13614,GLADSTONE.],Heard afar over moonlit seas:
13615,GLADSTONE.],"The Siren's song, grown faint in winging,"
13616,GLADSTONE.],Falls in scent on the cedar-trees.
13617,GLADSTONE.],
13618,GLADSTONE.],"As waifs blown out of the sunset, flying,"
13619,GLADSTONE.],"Purple, and rosy, and gray, the birds"
13620,GLADSTONE.],Brighten the air with their wings; their crying
13621,GLADSTONE.],Wakens a moment the weary herds.
13622,GLADSTONE.],
13623,GLADSTONE.],"Butterflies flit from the fairy garden,"
13624,GLADSTONE.],Living blossoms of flying flowers;
13625,GLADSTONE.],"Never the nights with winter harden,"
13626,GLADSTONE.],Nor moons wax keen in this land of ours.
13627,GLADSTONE.],
13628,GLADSTONE.],"Great fruits, fragrant, green and golden,"
13629,GLADSTONE.],"Gleam in the green, and droop and fall;"
13630,GLADSTONE.],"Blossom, and bud, and flower unfolden,"
13631,GLADSTONE.],Swing and cling to the garden wall.
13632,GLADSTONE.],
13633,GLADSTONE.],"Deep in the woods as twilight darkens,"
13634,GLADSTONE.],Glades are red with the scented fire;
13635,GLADSTONE.],Far in the dells the white maid hearkens
13636,GLADSTONE.],Song and sigh of the heart's desire.
13637,GLADSTONE.],
13638,GLADSTONE.],"Ulysses stood gazing in admiration, unobserved himself, for the"
13639,GLADSTONE.],cloud which Minerva spread around him still shielded him. At length
13640,GLADSTONE.],"having sufficiently observed the scene, he advanced with rapid step"
13641,GLADSTONE.],"into the hall where the chiefs and senators were assembled, pouring"
13642,GLADSTONE.],"libation to Mercury, whose worship followed the evening meal. Just"
13643,GLADSTONE.],then Minerva dissolved the cloud and disclosed him to the assembled
13644,GLADSTONE.],"chiefs. Advancing to the place where the queen sat, he knelt at her"
13645,GLADSTONE.],feet and implored her favor and assistance to enable him to return to
13646,GLADSTONE.],"his native country. Then withdrawing, he seated himself in the manner"
13647,GLADSTONE.],"of suppliants, at the hearth-side."
13648,GLADSTONE.],
13649,GLADSTONE.],"For a time none spoke. At last an aged statesman, addressing the king,"
13650,GLADSTONE.],"said, ""It is not fit that a stranger who asks our hospitality should"
13651,GLADSTONE.],"be kept waiting in suppliant guise, none welcoming him. Let him,"
13652,GLADSTONE.],"therefore, be led to a seat among us and supplied with food and wine."""
13653,GLADSTONE.],"At these words the king, rising, gave his hand to Ulysses and led him"
13654,GLADSTONE.],"to a seat, displacing thence his own son to make room for the stranger."
13655,GLADSTONE.],Food and wine were set before him and he ate and refreshed himself.
13656,GLADSTONE.],
13657,GLADSTONE.],"The king then dismissed his guests, notifying them that the next day he"
13658,GLADSTONE.],would call them to council to consider what had best be done for the
13659,GLADSTONE.],stranger.
13660,GLADSTONE.],
13661,GLADSTONE.],When the guests had departed and Ulysses was left alone with the king
13662,GLADSTONE.],"and queen, the queen asked him who he was and whence he came, and"
13663,GLADSTONE.],(recognizing the clothes which he wore as those which her maidens and
13664,GLADSTONE.],herself had made) from whom he received those garments. He told them of
13665,GLADSTONE.],his residence in Calypso's isle and his departure thence; of the wreck
13666,GLADSTONE.],"of his raft, his escape by swimming, and of the relief afforded by"
13667,GLADSTONE.],"the princess. The parents heard approvingly, and the king promised to"
13668,GLADSTONE.],furnish a ship in which his guest might return to his own land.
13669,GLADSTONE.],
13670,GLADSTONE.],The next day the assembled chiefs confirmed the promise of the
13671,GLADSTONE.],"king.[344] A bark was prepared and a crew of stout rowers selected,"
13672,GLADSTONE.],"and all betook themselves to the palace, where a bounteous repast was"
13673,GLADSTONE.],provided. After the feast the king proposed that the young men should
13674,GLADSTONE.],"show their guest their proficiency in manly sports, and all went forth"
13675,GLADSTONE.],"to the arena for games of running, wrestling, and other exercises."
13676,GLADSTONE.],"After all had done their best, Ulysses being challenged to show what he"
13677,GLADSTONE.],"could do, at first declined, but being taunted by one of the youths,"
13678,GLADSTONE.],seized a quoit of weight far heavier than any the Phæacians had
13679,GLADSTONE.],"thrown, and sent it farther than the utmost throw of theirs. All were"
13680,GLADSTONE.],astonished and viewed their guest with greatly increased respect.
13681,GLADSTONE.],
13682,GLADSTONE.],"After the games they returned to the hall, and the herald led in"
13683,GLADSTONE.],"Demodocus, the blind bard,--"
13684,GLADSTONE.],
13685,GLADSTONE.],"Dear to the Muse,"
13686,GLADSTONE.],"Who yet appointed him both good and ill,"
13687,GLADSTONE.],"Took from him sight, but gave him strains divine."
13688,GLADSTONE.],
13689,GLADSTONE.],"He took for his theme the Wooden Horse, by means of which the Greeks"
13690,GLADSTONE.],"found entrance into Troy. Apollo inspired him, and he sang so feelingly"
13691,GLADSTONE.],the terrors and the exploits of that eventful time that all were
13692,GLADSTONE.],"delighted, but Ulysses was moved to tears. Observing which, Alcinoüs,"
13693,GLADSTONE.],"when the song was done, demanded of him why at the mention of Troy"
13694,GLADSTONE.],"his sorrows awaked. Had he lost there a father, or brother, or any"
13695,GLADSTONE.],"dear friend? Ulysses replied by announcing himself by his true name,"
13696,GLADSTONE.],"and, at their request, recounted the adventures which had befallen"
13697,GLADSTONE.],him since his departure from Troy. This narrative raised the sympathy
13698,GLADSTONE.],and admiration of the Phæacians for their guest to the highest pitch.
13699,GLADSTONE.],"The king proposed that all the chiefs should present him with a gift,"
13700,GLADSTONE.],"himself setting the example. They obeyed, and vied with one another in"
13701,GLADSTONE.],loading the illustrious stranger with costly gifts.
13702,GLADSTONE.],
13703,GLADSTONE.],"The next day Ulysses set sail in the Phæacian vessel, and in a short"
13704,GLADSTONE.],"time arrived safe at Ithaca, his own island.[345] When the vessel"
13705,GLADSTONE.],"touched the strand he was asleep. The mariners, without waking him,"
13706,GLADSTONE.],"carried him on shore, and landed with him the chest containing his"
13707,GLADSTONE.],"presents, and then sailed away."
13708,GLADSTONE.],
13709,GLADSTONE.],Neptune was so displeased at the conduct of the Phæacians in thus
13710,GLADSTONE.],"rescuing Ulysses from his hands, that, on the return of the vessel to"
13711,GLADSTONE.],"port, he transformed it into a rock, right opposite the mouth of the"
13712,GLADSTONE.],harbor.
13713,GLADSTONE.],
13714,GLADSTONE.],=243. Fate of the Suitors.= Ulysses had now been away from Ithaca for
13715,GLADSTONE.],"twenty years, and when he awoke he did not recognize his native land:"
13716,GLADSTONE.],
13717,GLADSTONE.],"""Some god hath cast me forth upon this land,"
13718,GLADSTONE.],"And O! what land? So thick is the sea mist,"
13719,GLADSTONE.],All is phantasmal. What king ruleth here?
13720,GLADSTONE.],"What folk inhabit?--cruel unto strangers,"

13722,GLADSTONE.],When they foretold I should see Ithaca.
13723,GLADSTONE.],"This is some swimming and Cimmerian isle,"
13724,GLADSTONE.],With melancholy people of the mist.
13725,GLADSTONE.],"Ah! Ithaca, I shall not see thee more!""[346]"
13726,GLADSTONE.],
13727,GLADSTONE.],"But Minerva, appearing in the form of a young shepherd, informed him"
13728,GLADSTONE.],"where he was, and told him the state of things at his palace. More than"
13729,GLADSTONE.],a hundred nobles of Ithaca and of the neighboring islands had been for
13730,GLADSTONE.],"years suing for the hand of Penelope, his wife, imagining him dead, and"
13731,GLADSTONE.],lording it over his palace and people as if they were owners of both.
13732,GLADSTONE.],
13733,GLADSTONE.],Penelope was one of those mythic heroines whose beauties were not
13734,GLADSTONE.],"those of person only, but of character and conduct as well. She was"
13735,GLADSTONE.],"the niece of Tyndareus,--being the daughter of his brother Icarius,"
13736,GLADSTONE.],"a Spartan prince. Ulysses, seeking her in marriage, had won her over"
13737,GLADSTONE.],"all competitors. But, when the moment came for the bride to leave"
13738,GLADSTONE.],"her father's house, Icarius, unable to bear the thoughts of parting"
13739,GLADSTONE.],"with his daughter, tried to persuade her to remain with him and not"
13740,GLADSTONE.],"accompany her husband to Ithaca. Ulysses gave Penelope her choice, to"
13741,GLADSTONE.],"stay or go with him. Penelope made no reply, but dropped her veil over"
13742,GLADSTONE.],"her face. Icarius urged her no further, but when she was gone erected a"
13743,GLADSTONE.],statue to Modesty on the spot where they had parted.
13744,GLADSTONE.],
13745,GLADSTONE.],Ulysses and Penelope had not enjoyed their union more than a year when
13746,GLADSTONE.],it was interrupted by the events which called Ulysses to the Trojan
13747,GLADSTONE.],"War. During his long absence, and when it was doubtful whether he still"
13748,GLADSTONE.],"lived, and highly improbable that he would ever return, Penelope was"
13749,GLADSTONE.],"importuned by numerous suitors, from whom there seemed no refuge but"
13750,GLADSTONE.],"in choosing one of them for her husband. She, however, employed every"
13751,GLADSTONE.],"art to gain time, still hoping for Ulysses' return. One of her arts"
13752,GLADSTONE.],of delay was by engaging in the preparation of a robe for the funeral
13753,GLADSTONE.],"canopy of Laërtes, her husband's father. She pledged herself to make"
13754,GLADSTONE.],her choice among the suitors when the web was finished. During the day
13755,GLADSTONE.],"she worked at it, but in the night she undid the work of the day."

13757,GLADSTONE.],[Illustration: FIG. 176. PENELOPE AND TELEMACHUS]
13758,GLADSTONE.],
13759,GLADSTONE.],That Ulysses on returning might be able to take vengeance upon the
13760,GLADSTONE.],"suitors, it was important that he should not be recognized. Minerva"
13761,GLADSTONE.],"accordingly metamorphosed him into an unsightly beggar, and as such he"
13762,GLADSTONE.],"was kindly received by Eumæus, the swineherd, a faithful servant of his"
13763,GLADSTONE.],house.[347]
13764,GLADSTONE.],
13765,GLADSTONE.],"Telemachus, his son, had for some time been absent in quest of his"
13766,GLADSTONE.],"father, visiting the courts of the other kings who had returned"
13767,GLADSTONE.],"from the Trojan expedition. While on the search, he received counsel"
13768,GLADSTONE.],"from Minerva to return home.[348] He arrived at this juncture, and"
13769,GLADSTONE.],sought Eumæus to learn something of the state of affairs at the palace
13770,GLADSTONE.],before presenting himself among the suitors. Finding a stranger with
13771,GLADSTONE.],"Eumæus, he treated him courteously, though in the garb of a beggar,"
13772,GLADSTONE.],and promised him assistance. Eumæus was sent to the palace to inform
13773,GLADSTONE.],"Penelope privately of her son's arrival, for caution was necessary with"
13774,GLADSTONE.],"regard to the suitors, who, as Telemachus had learned, were plotting"
13775,GLADSTONE.],"to intercept and kill him. When the swineherd was gone, Minerva"
13776,GLADSTONE.],presented herself to Ulysses and directed him to make himself known to
13777,GLADSTONE.],"his son. At the same time she touched him, removed at once from him"
13778,GLADSTONE.],"the appearance of age and penury, and gave him the aspect of vigorous"
13779,GLADSTONE.],"manhood that belonged to him. Telemachus viewed him with astonishment,"
13780,GLADSTONE.],and at first thought he must be more than mortal. But Ulysses announced
13781,GLADSTONE.],"himself as his father, and accounted for the change of appearance by"
13782,GLADSTONE.],explaining that it was Minerva's doing.
13783,GLADSTONE.],
13784,GLADSTONE.],Then threw Telemachus
13785,GLADSTONE.],His arms around his father's neck and wept.
13786,GLADSTONE.],Desire intense of lamentation seized
13787,GLADSTONE.],"On both; soft murmurs uttering, each indulged"
13788,GLADSTONE.],His grief.[349]
13789,GLADSTONE.],
13790,GLADSTONE.],The father and son took counsel together how they should get the better
13791,GLADSTONE.],of the suitors and punish them for their outrages. It was arranged that
13792,GLADSTONE.],Telemachus should proceed to the palace and mingle with the suitors as
13793,GLADSTONE.],"formerly; that Ulysses should also go as a beggar, a character which in"
13794,GLADSTONE.],the rude old times had different privileges from what we concede to it
13795,GLADSTONE.],"now. As traveler and storyteller, the beggar was admitted in the halls"
13796,GLADSTONE.],"of chieftains and often treated like a guest; though sometimes, also,"
13797,GLADSTONE.],"no doubt, with contumely. Ulysses charged his son not to betray, by any"
13798,GLADSTONE.],"display of unusual interest in him, that he knew him to be other than"
13799,GLADSTONE.],"he seemed, and even if he saw him insulted or beaten, not to interpose"
13800,GLADSTONE.],otherwise than he might do for any stranger. At the palace they found
13801,GLADSTONE.],the usual scene of feasting and riot going on. The suitors pretended
13802,GLADSTONE.],"to receive Telemachus with joy at his return, though secretly mortified"
13803,GLADSTONE.],at the failure of their plots to take his life. The old beggar was
13804,GLADSTONE.],permitted to enter and provided with a portion from the table. A
13805,GLADSTONE.],touching incident occurred as Ulysses entered the courtyard of the

13810,GLADSTONE.],Soon as he perceived

13823,GLADSTONE.],
13824,GLADSTONE.],"As Ulysses sat eating his portion in the hall, the suitors soon began"
13825,GLADSTONE.],"to exhibit their insolence to him. When he mildly remonstrated, one of"
13826,GLADSTONE.],them raised a stool and with it gave him a blow. Telemachus had hard
13827,GLADSTONE.],work to restrain his indignation at seeing his father so treated in his
13828,GLADSTONE.],"own hall; but, remembering his father's injunctions, said no more than"
13829,GLADSTONE.],"what became him as master of the house, though young, and protector of"
13830,GLADSTONE.],his guests.
13831,GLADSTONE.],
13832,GLADSTONE.],Once again was the wanderer all but betrayed;--when his aged nurse
13833,GLADSTONE.],"Euryclea, bathing his feet, recognized the scar of a wound dealt him"
13834,GLADSTONE.],"by a boar, long ago.[351] Grief and joy overwhelmed the crone, and she"
13835,GLADSTONE.],would have revealed him to Penelope had not Ulysses enjoined silence
13836,GLADSTONE.],upon her.
13837,GLADSTONE.],
13838,GLADSTONE.],Penelope had protracted her decision in favor of any one of her suitors
13839,GLADSTONE.],so long that there seemed to be no further pretense for delay. The
13840,GLADSTONE.],continued absence of her husband seemed to prove that his return was no
13841,GLADSTONE.],longer to be expected. Meanwhile her son had grown up and was able to
13842,GLADSTONE.],manage his own affairs. She therefore consented to submit the question
13843,GLADSTONE.],of her choice to a trial of skill among the suitors. The test selected
13844,GLADSTONE.],"was shooting with the bow.[352] Twelve rings were arranged in a line,"
13845,GLADSTONE.],and he whose arrow was sent through the whole twelve was to have the
13846,GLADSTONE.],queen for his prize. A bow that one of his brother heroes had given to
13847,GLADSTONE.],Ulysses in former times was brought from the armory and with its quiver
13848,GLADSTONE.],full of arrows was laid in the hall. Telemachus had taken care that all
13849,GLADSTONE.],"other weapons should be removed, under pretense that in the heat of"
13850,GLADSTONE.],"competition there was danger, in some rash moment, of putting them to"
13851,GLADSTONE.],an improper use.

13857,GLADSTONE.],"All things being prepared for the trial, the first thing to be done was"
13858,GLADSTONE.],to bend the bow in order to attach the string. Telemachus endeavored
13859,GLADSTONE.],"to do it, but found all his efforts fruitless; and modestly confessing"
13860,GLADSTONE.],"that he had attempted a task beyond his strength, he yielded the bow"
13861,GLADSTONE.],"to another, _He_ tried it with no better success, and, amidst the"
13862,GLADSTONE.],"laughter and jeers of his companions, gave it up. Another tried it, and"
13863,GLADSTONE.],"another; they rubbed the bow with tallow, but all to no purpose; it"
13864,GLADSTONE.],"would not bend. Then spoke Ulysses, humbly suggesting that he should be"
13865,GLADSTONE.],"permitted to try; for, said he, ""beggar as I am, I was once a soldier,"
13866,GLADSTONE.],"and there is still some strength in these old limbs of mine."" The"
13867,GLADSTONE.],suitors hooted with derision and commanded to turn him out of the hall
13868,GLADSTONE.],"for his insolence. But Telemachus spoke up for him, and, merely to"
13869,GLADSTONE.],"gratify the old man, bade him try. Ulysses took the bow and handled it"
13870,GLADSTONE.],"with the hand of a master. With ease he adjusted the cord to its notch,"
13871,GLADSTONE.],then fitting an arrow to the bow he drew the string and sped the arrow

14061,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"heroes, Ulysses, in his wanderings on his return home from Troy. Virgil"
14062,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,in his Æneid[355] narrates the mythical fortunes of the remnant of the
14063,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"_conquered_ people under their chief Æneas, the son of Venus and the"
14064,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Trojan Anchises, in their search for a new home after the ruin of their"
14065,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,native city. On that fatal night when the wooden horse disgorged its
14066,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"contents of armed men, and the capture and conflagration of the city"
14067,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"were the result, Æneas made his escape from the scene of destruction,"
14068,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"with his father and his wife and young son. The father, Anchises, was"
14069,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"too old to walk with the speed required, and Æneas took him upon his"
14070,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"shoulders. Thus burdened, leading his son and followed by his wife, he"

14077,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"numerous fugitives of both sexes were found, who put themselves under"
14078,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the guidance of Æneas. Some months were spent in preparation, and at"
14079,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,length they embarked. They first landed on the neighboring shores of
14080,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Thrace, and were preparing to build a city, but Æneas was deterred by"
14081,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"a prodigy. Preparing to offer sacrifice, he tore some twigs from one"
14082,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,of the bushes. To his dismay the wounded part dropped blood. When he
14083,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"repeated the act, a voice from the ground cried out to him, ""Spare me,"
14084,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas; I am thy kinsman, Polydore, here murdered with many arrows, from"
14085,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"which a bush has grown, nourished with my blood."" These words recalled"
14086,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"to the recollection of Æneas that Polydore was a young prince of Troy,"
14087,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,whom his father had sent with ample treasures to the neighboring land
14088,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of Thrace, to be there brought up, at a distance from the horrors of"
14089,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,war. The king to whom he was sent had murdered him and seized his
14090,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"treasures. Æneas and his companions, considering the land accursed by"
14091,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the stain of such a crime, hastened away."
14092,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14093,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=247. The Promised Empire.= They next landed on the island of Delos.
14094,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Here Æneas consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received an answer,"
14095,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"ambiguous as usual,--""Seek thy ancient mother; there the race of"
14096,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas shall dwell, and reduce all other nations to their sway."" The"
14097,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Trojans heard with joy and immediately began to ask one another, ""Where"
14098,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"is the spot intended by the oracle?"" Anchises remembered that there"
14099,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"was a tradition that their forefathers came from Crete, and thither"
14100,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,they resolved to steer. They arrived at Crete and began to build
14101,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"their city; but sickness broke out among them, and the fields that"
14102,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"they had planted, failed to yield a crop. In this gloomy aspect of"
14103,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"affairs, Æneas was warned in a dream to leave the country and seek a"
14104,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"western land called Hesperia, whence Dardanus, the true founder of the"
14105,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Trojan race, was reported to have migrated. To Hesperia, now called"
14106,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Italy, they therefore directed their future course, and not till after"
14107,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"many adventures, and the lapse of time sufficient to carry a modern"
14108,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"navigator several times round the world, did they arrive there."
14109,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14110,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=248. The Harpies.= Their first landing was at the island of the
14111,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Harpies. These were disgusting birds, with the heads of maidens, with"
14112,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"long claws, and faces pale with hunger. They were sent by the gods to"
14113,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"torment a certain Phineus, whom Jupiter had deprived of his sight in"
14114,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"punishment of his cruelty; and whenever a meal was placed before him,"
14115,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the harpies darted down from the air and carried it off. They were
14116,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"driven away from Phineus by the heroes of the Argonautic expedition,"
14117,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,and took refuge in the island where Æneas now found them. When the
14118,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Trojans entered the port they saw herds of cattle roaming over the
14119,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"plain. They slew as many as they wished, and prepared for a feast."
14120,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,But no sooner had they seated themselves at the table than a horrible
14121,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"clamor was heard in the air, and a flock of these odious harpies came"
14122,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"rushing down upon them, seizing in their talons the meat from the"
14123,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,dishes and flying away with it. Æneas and his companions drew their
14124,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"swords and dealt vigorous blows among the monsters, but to no purpose,"
14125,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"for they were so nimble it was almost impossible to hit them, and their"
14126,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"feathers were, like armor, impenetrable to steel. One of them, perched"
14127,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"on a neighboring cliff, screamed out, ""Is it thus, Trojans, ye treat"
14128,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"us innocent birds, first slaughter our cattle and then make war on"
14129,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"ourselves?"" She then predicted dire sufferings to them in their future"

14131,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14132,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"=249. Epirus.= The Trojans made haste to leave the country, and next"
14133,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,found themselves coasting along the shore of Epirus. Here they landed
14134,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"and to their astonishment learned that certain Trojan exiles, who had"
14135,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"been carried there as prisoners, had become rulers of the country."
14136,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Andromache, the widow of Hector, had borne three sons to Neoptolemus"
14137,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"in Epirus. But when he cast her off for Hermione, he left her to her"
14138,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"fellow-captive, Helenus, Hector's brother. Now that Neoptolemus was"
14139,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,dead she had become the wife of Helenus; and they ruled the realm.
14140,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Helenus and Andromache treated the exiles with the utmost hospitality,"
14141,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,and dismissed them loaded with gifts.

14145,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=250. The Cyclopes Again.= From hence Æneas coasted along the shore of
14146,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Sicily and passed the country of the Cyclopes. Here they were hailed
14147,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"from the shore by a miserable object, whom by his garments tattered,"
14148,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"as they were, they perceived to be a Greek. He told them he was one"
14149,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of Ulysses' companions, left behind by that chief in his hurried"
14150,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"departure. He related the story of Ulysses' adventure with Polyphemus,"
14151,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"and besought them to take him off with them, as he had no means of"
14152,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"sustaining his existence where he was, but wild berries and roots, and"
14153,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,lived in constant fear of the Cyclopes. While he spoke Polyphemus made
14154,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"his appearance,--terrible, shapeless, vast, and, of course, blind.[356]"
14155,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"He walked with cautious steps, feeling his way with a staff, down to"
14156,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the seaside, to wash his eye-socket in the waves. When he reached the"
14157,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"water he waded out towards them, and his immense height enabled him to"
14158,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"advance far into the sea, so that the Trojans in terror took to their"
14159,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"oars to get out of his way. Hearing the oars, Polyphemus shouted after"
14160,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"them so that the shores resounded, and at the noise the other Cyclopes"
14161,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"came forth from their caves and woods, and lined the shore, like a row"
14162,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,of lofty pine trees. The Trojans plied their oars and soon left them
14163,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,out of sight.
14164,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14165,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Æneas had been cautioned by Helenus to avoid the strait guarded by the
14166,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"monsters Scylla and Charybdis. There Ulysses, the reader will remember,"
14167,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"had lost six of his men, seized by Scylla while the navigators were"
14168,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"wholly intent upon avoiding Charybdis. Æneas, following the advice of"
14169,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Helenus, shunned the dangerous pass and coasted along the island of"
14170,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Sicily.
14171,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14172,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"=251. The Resentment of Juno.= Now Juno, seeing the Trojans speeding"
14173,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"their way prosperously towards their destined shore, felt her old"
14174,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"grudge against them revive, for she could not forget the slight that"
14175,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Paris had put upon her in awarding the prize of beauty to another. In
14176,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,heavenly minds can such resentment dwell![357] Accordingly she gave
14177,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"orders to Æolus, who sent forth his sons, Boreas, Typhon, and the other"
14178,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"winds, to toss the ocean. A terrible storm ensued, and the Trojan ships"
14179,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,were driven out of their course towards the coast of Africa. They were
14180,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"in imminent danger of being wrecked, and were separated, so that Æneas"
14181,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,thought that all were lost except his own vessel.
14182,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14183,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"At this crisis, Neptune, hearing the storm raging, and knowing that he"
14184,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"had given no orders for one, raised his head above the waves and saw"
14185,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the fleet of Æneas driving before the gale. Understanding the hostility
14186,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of Juno, he was at no loss to account for it, but his anger was not"
14187,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the less at this interference in his province. He called the winds and
14188,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"dismissed them with a severe reprimand. He then soothed the waves, and"
14189,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,brushed away the clouds from before the face of the sun. Some of the
14190,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"ships which had got on the rocks he pried off with his own trident,"
14191,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"while Triton and a sea-nymph, putting their shoulders under others, set"
14192,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"them afloat again. The Trojans, when the sea became calm, sought the"
14193,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"nearest shore,--the coast of Carthage, where Æneas was so happy as to"
14194,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"find that one by one the ships all arrived safe, though badly shaken."
14195,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14196,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"=252. The Sojourn at Carthage. Dido.= Carthage, where the exiles had"
14197,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"now arrived, was a spot on the coast of Africa opposite Sicily, where"
14198,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"at that time a Tyrian colony under Dido, their queen, were laying"
14199,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the foundations of a state destined in later ages to be the rival of
14200,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Rome itself. Dido was the daughter of Belus, king of Tyre, and sister"
14201,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of Pygmalion, who succeeded his father on the throne. Her husband"
14202,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"was Sichæus, a man of immense wealth, but Pygmalion, who coveted his"
14203,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"treasures, caused him to be put to death. Dido, with a numerous body of"
14204,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"friends and followers, both men and women, succeeded in effecting their"
14205,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"escape from Tyre, in several vessels, carrying with them the treasures"
14206,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,of Sichæus. On arriving at the spot which they selected as the seat of
14207,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"their future home, they asked of the natives only so much land as they"
14208,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"could inclose with a bull's hide. When this was readily granted, the"
14209,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"queen caused the hide to be cut into strips, and with them inclosed a"
14210,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"spot on which she built a citadel, and called it Byrsa (a hide). Around"
14211,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"this fort the city of Carthage rose, and soon became a powerful and"
14212,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,flourishing place.
14213,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14214,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Such was the state of affairs when Æneas with his Trojans arrived
14215,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,there. Dido received the illustrious exiles with friendliness and
14216,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"hospitality. ""Not unacquainted with distress,"" she said, ""I have"
14217,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"learned to succor the unfortunate.""[358] The queen's hospitality"
14218,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,displayed itself in festivities at which games of strength and skill
14219,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,were exhibited. The strangers contended for the palm with her own
14220,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"subjects on equal terms, the queen declaring that whether the victor"
14221,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"were ""Trojan or Tyrian should make no difference to her.""[359] At the"
14222,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"feast which followed the games, Æneas gave at her request a recital of"
14223,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the closing events of the Trojan history and his own adventures after
14224,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the fall of the city. Dido was charmed with his discourse and filled
14225,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,with admiration of his exploits. She conceived an ardent passion for
14226,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"him, and he for his part seemed well content to accept the fortunate"
14227,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,chance which appeared to offer him at once a happy termination of his
14228,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"wanderings, a home, a kingdom, and a bride. Months rolled away in the"
14229,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"enjoyment of pleasant intercourse, and it seemed as if Italy and the"
14230,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,empire destined to be founded on its shores were alike forgotten.
14231,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Seeing which, Jupiter dispatched Mercury with a message to Æneas"
14232,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"recalling him to a sense of his high destiny, and commanding him to"
14233,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,resume his voyage.
14234,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14235,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas parted from Dido, though she tried every allurement and"
14236,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,persuasion to detain him. The blow to her affection and her pride was
14237,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"too much for her to endure, and when she found that he was gone, she"
14238,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"mounted a funeral pile which she had caused to be prepared, and having"
14239,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,stabbed herself was consumed with the pile. The flames rising over the
14240,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"city were seen by the departing Trojans, and, though the cause was"
14241,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"unknown, gave to Æneas some intimation of the fatal event."
14242,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14243,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=253. Palinurus. Italy at Last.= After touching at the island of
14244,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Sicily, where Acestes, a prince of Trojan lineage, bore sway, and gave"
14245,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"them a hospitable reception, the Trojans reëmbarked and held on their"
14246,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,course for Italy. Venus now interceded with Neptune to allow her son at
14247,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,last to attain the wished-for goal and find an end of his perils on the
14248,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"deep. Neptune consented, stipulating only for one life as a ransom for"
14249,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the rest. The victim was Palinurus, the pilot. As he sat watching the"
14250,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"stars with his hand on the helm, Somnus, sent by Neptune, approached"
14251,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"in the guise of Phorbas, and said, ""Palinurus, the breeze is fair,"
14252,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the water smooth, and the ship sails steadily on her course. Lie down"
14253,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"awhile and take needful rest. I will stand at the helm in thy place."""
14254,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Palinurus replied, ""Tell me not of smooth seas or favoring winds,--me"
14255,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,who have seen so much of their treachery. Shall I trust Æneas to the
14256,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"chances of the weather and the winds?"" And he continued to grasp the"
14257,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,helm and to keep his eyes fixed on the stars. But Somnus waved over
14258,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"him a branch moistened with Lethæan dew, and his eyes closed in spite"
14259,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of all his efforts. Then Somnus pushed him overboard, and he fell;"
14260,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"but as he kept his hold upon the helm, it came away with him. Neptune"
14261,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"was mindful of his promise, and held the ship on her track without"
14262,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"helm or pilot till Æneas discovered his loss and, sorrowing deeply for"
14263,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"his faithful steersman, took charge of the ship himself. Under his"
14264,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"guidance the ships at last reached the shores of Italy, and joyfully"
14265,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the adventurers leaped to land.

14270,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14271,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=254. The Sibyl of Cumæ.= While his people were employed in making
14272,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"their encampment, Æneas sought the abode of the Sibyl. It was a cave"
14273,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"connected with a temple and grove, sacred to Apollo and Diana. While"
14274,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas contemplated the scene, the Sibyl accosted him. She seemed"
14275,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"to know his errand, and, under the influence of the deity of the"
14276,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"place, burst forth in a prophetic strain, giving dark intimations"
14277,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,of labors and perils through which he was destined to make his way
14278,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,to final success. She closed with the encouraging words which have
14279,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"become proverbial: ""Yield not to disasters, but press onward the more"
14280,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"bravely.""[360] Æneas replied that he had prepared himself for whatever"
14281,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,might await him. He had but one request to make. Having been directed
14282,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,in a dream to seek the abode of the dead in order to confer with
14283,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,his father Anchises to receive from him a revelation of his future
14284,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"fortunes and those of his race, he asked her assistance to enable him"
14285,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"to accomplish the task. The Sibyl replied: ""The descent to Avernus"
14286,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,is easy; the gate of Pluto stands open night and day; but to retrace
14287,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"one's steps and return to the upper air, that is the toil, that the"
14288,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"difficulty.""[361] She instructed him to seek in the forest a tree on"
14289,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,which grew a golden branch. This branch was to be plucked off and
14290,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"borne as a gift to Proserpine, and if fate was propitious, it would"
14291,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"yield to the hand and quit its parent trunk, but otherwise no force"
14292,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"could rend it away. If torn away, another would succeed."
14293,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14294,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas followed the directions of the Sibyl. His mother, Venus, sent"
14295,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"two of her doves to fly before him and show him the way, and by their"
14296,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"assistance he found the tree, plucked the branch, and hastened back"
14297,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,with it to the Sibyl.
14298,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14299,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=255. The Infernal Regions.= The region where Virgil locates the
14300,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"entrance to the infernal regions is, perhaps, the most strikingly"
14301,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,adapted to excite ideas of the terrific and preternatural of any
14302,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"on the face of the earth. It is the volcanic region near Vesuvius,"
14303,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,where the whole country is cleft with chasms from which sulphurous
14304,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"flames arise, while the ground is shaken with pent-up vapors, and"
14305,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,mysterious sounds issue from the bowels of the earth. The lake Avernus
14306,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"is supposed to fill the crater of an extinct volcano. It is circular,"
14307,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"half a mile wide and very deep, surrounded by high banks, which in"
14308,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Virgil's time were covered with a gloomy forest. Mephitic vapors rise
14309,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"from its waters, so that no life is found on its banks, and no birds"
14310,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"fly over it. Here Æneas offered sacrifices to the infernal deities,"
14311,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Proserpine, Hecate, and the Furies. Then a roaring was heard in the"
14312,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"earth, the woods on the hilltops were shaken, and the howling of dogs"
14313,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"announced the approach of the deities. ""Now,"" said the Sibyl, ""summon"
14314,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"thy courage, for thou shalt need it."" She descended into the cave of"
14315,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Avernus, and Æneas followed. Before the threshold of hell they passed"
14316,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,through a group of beings who are enumerated as Griefs and avenging
14317,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Cares, pale Diseases, and melancholy Age, Fear and Hunger that tempt to"
14318,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"crime, Toil, Poverty, and Death,--forms horrible to view. The Furies"
14319,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"spread their couches there, and Discord, whose hair was of vipers tied"
14320,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"up with a bloody fillet. Here also were the monsters, Briareus, with"
14321,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"his hundred arms, Hydras hissing, and Chimæras breathing fire. Æneas"
14322,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"shuddered at the sight, drew his sword and would have struck, but"
14323,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the Sibyl restrained him. They then came to the black river Cocytus,"
14324,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"where they found the ferryman Charon, old and squalid, but strong and"
14325,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"vigorous, who was receiving passengers of all kinds into his boat,"
14326,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"stout-hearted heroes, boys and unmarried girls, as numerous as the"
14327,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,leaves that fall at autumn or the flocks that fly southward at the
14328,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,approach of winter. They stood pressing for a passage and longing to
14329,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,touch the opposite shore. But the stern ferryman took in only such
14330,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"as he chose, driving the rest back. Æneas, wondering at the sight,"
14331,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"asked the Sibyl, ""Why this discrimination?"" She answered, ""Those who"
14332,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,are taken on board the bark are the souls of those who have received
14333,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,due burial rites; the host of others who have remained unburied are
14334,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"not permitted to pass the flood, but wander a hundred years, and flit"
14335,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"to and fro about the shore, till at last they are taken over."" Æneas"
14336,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,grieved at recollecting some of his own companions who had perished
14337,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"in the storm. At that moment he beheld Palinurus, his pilot, who fell"
14338,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,overboard and was drowned. He addressed him and asked him the cause of
14339,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"his misfortune. Palinurus replied that the rudder was carried away,"
14340,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"and he, clinging to it, was swept away with it. He besought Æneas most"
14341,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,urgently to extend to him his hand and take him in company to the
14342,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,opposite shore. The Sibyl rebuked him for the wish thus to transgress
14343,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the laws of Pluto, but consoled him by informing him that the people of"
14344,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,the shore where his body had been wafted by the waves should be stirred
14345,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"up by prodigies to give it due burial, and that the promontory should"
14346,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"bear the name of Cape Palinurus,--and so it does to this day. Leaving"
14347,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Palinurus consoled by these words, they approached the boat. Charon,"
14348,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"fixing his eyes sternly upon the advancing warrior, demanded by what"
14349,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"right he, living and armed, approached that shore. To which the Sibyl"
14350,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"replied that they would commit no violence, that Æneas' only object"
14351,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"was to see his father, and finally exhibited the golden branch, at"
14352,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"sight of which Charon's wrath relaxed, and he made haste to turn his"
14353,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"bark to the shore and receive them on board. The boat, adapted only to"
14354,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the light freight of bodiless spirits, groaned under the weight of the"
14355,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,hero. They were soon conveyed to the opposite shore. There they were
14356,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"encountered by the three-headed dog Cerberus, with his necks bristling"
14357,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,with snakes. He barked with all three throats till the Sibyl threw him
14358,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"a medicated cake, which he eagerly devoured, and then stretched himself"
14359,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,out in his den and fell asleep. Æneas and the Sibyl sprang to land. The
14360,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,first sound that struck their ears was the wailing of young children
14361,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,who had died on the threshold of life; and near to these were those who
14362,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,had perished under false charges. Minos presides over them as judge and
14363,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,examines the deeds of each. The next class was of those who had died by
14364,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"their own hand, hating life and seeking refuge in death. How willingly"
14365,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"would they now endure poverty, labor, and any other infliction if they"
14366,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"might but return to life! Next were situated the regions of sadness,"
14367,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"divided off into retired paths, leading through groves of myrtle. Here"
14368,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"roamed those who had fallen victims to unrequited love, not freed"
14369,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,from pain even by death itself. Among these Æneas thought he descried
14370,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the form of Dido, with a wound still recent. In the dim light he was"
14371,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"for a moment uncertain, but approaching, perceived it was indeed she."
14372,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Tears fell from his eyes, and he addressed her in the accents of love."
14373,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"""Unhappy Dido! was then the rumor true that thou hadst perished? And"
14374,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"was I, alas! the cause? I call the gods to witness that my departure"
14375,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,from thee was reluctant and in obedience to the commands of Jove; nor
14376,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"could I believe that my absence would have cost thee so dear. Stop,"
14377,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"I beseech thee, and refuse me not a last farewell."" She stood for a"
14378,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"moment with averted countenance and eyes fixed on the ground, and"
14379,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"then silently passed on, as insensible to his pleadings as a rock."
14380,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas followed for some distance, then with a heavy heart rejoined his"
14381,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,companion and resumed his route.
14382,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14383,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,They next entered the fields where roam the heroes who have fallen in
14384,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,battle. Here they saw many shades of Grecian and Trojan warriors. The
14385,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Trojans thronged around him and could not be satisfied with the sight.
14386,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,They asked the cause of his coming and plied him with innumerable
14387,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"questions. But the Greeks, at the sight of his armor glittering through"
14388,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the murky atmosphere, recognized the hero, and, filled with terror,"
14389,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"turned their backs and fled, as they used to do on the plains of Troy."
14390,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14391,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas would have lingered long with his Trojan friends, but the Sibyl"
14392,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"hurried him away. They next came to a place where the road divided,"
14393,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the one way leading to Elysium, the other to the regions of the"
14394,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"condemned. Æneas beheld on one side the walls of a mighty city, around"
14395,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,which Phlegethon rolled its fiery waters. Before him was the gate of
14396,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,adamant that neither gods nor men can break through. An iron tower
14397,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"stood by the gate, on which Tisiphone, the avenging Fury, kept guard."
14398,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"From the city were heard groans, and the sound of the scourge, the"
14399,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"creaking of iron, and the clanking of chains. Æneas, horror-stricken,"
14400,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,inquired of his guide what crimes were those whose punishments produced
14401,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the sounds he heard. The Sibyl answered, ""Here is the judgment hall"
14402,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of Rhadamanthus, who brings to light crimes done in life which the"
14403,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,perpetrator vainly thought impenetrably hid. Tisiphone applies her whip
14404,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of scorpions and delivers the offender over to her sister Furies."" At"
14405,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"this moment with horrid clang the brazen gates unfolded, and within,"
14406,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,Æneas saw a Hydra with fifty heads guarding the entrance. The Sibyl
14407,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"told him that the gulf of Tartarus descended deep, so that its recesses"
14408,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,were as far beneath their feet as heaven was high above their heads. In
14409,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the bottom of this pit the Titan race, who warred against the gods, lie"
14410,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"prostrate; Salmoneus also, who presumed to vie with Jupiter, and built"
14411,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,a bridge of brass over which he drove his chariot that the sound might
14412,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"resemble thunder, launching flaming brands at his people in imitation"
14413,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of lightning, till Jupiter struck him with a real thunderbolt and"
14414,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,taught him the difference between mortal weapons and divine. Here also
14415,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"is Tityus, the giant, whose form is so immense that, as he lies, he"
14416,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"stretches over nine acres, while a vulture preys upon his liver, which"
14417,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"as fast as it is devoured grows again, so that his punishment will have"
14418,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,no end.
14419,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14420,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas saw groups seated at tables loaded with dainties, while near by"
14421,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,stood a Fury who snatched away the viands from their lips as fast as
14422,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,they prepared to taste them. Others beheld suspended over their heads
14423,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"huge rocks, threatening to fall, keeping them in a state of constant"
14424,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"alarm. These were they who had hated their brothers, or struck their"
14425,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"parents, or defrauded the friends who trusted them, or who, having"
14426,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"grown rich, kept their money to themselves and gave no share to"
14427,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"others,--the last being the most numerous class. Here also were those"
14428,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"who had violated the marriage vow, or fought in a bad cause, or failed"
14429,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,in fidelity to their employers. Here was one who had sold his country
14430,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"for gold, another who perverted the laws, making them say one thing"
14431,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,to-day and another to-morrow.
14432,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14433,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Ixion was there, fastened to the circumference of a wheel ceaselessly"
14434,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"revolving; and Sisyphus, whose task was to roll a huge stone up to a"
14435,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"hilltop; but when the steep was well-nigh gained, the rock, repulsed by"
14436,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"some sudden force, rushed again headlong down to the plain. Again he"
14437,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"toiled at it, while the sweat bathed all his weary limbs, but all to no"
14438,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"effect. There was Tantalus, who stood in a pool his chin level with the"
14439,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"water, yet he was parched with thirst and found nothing to assuage it;"
14440,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"for when he bowed his hoary head, eager to quaff, the water fled away,"
14441,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"leaving the ground at his feet all dry. Tall trees, laden with fruit,"
14442,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"stooped their heads to him,--pears, pomegranates, apples, and luscious"
14443,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"figs; but when, with a sudden grasp, he tried to seize them, winds"
14444,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,whirled them high above his reach.

14447,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14448,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=256. The Elysian Fields.= The Sibyl now warned Æneas that it was
14449,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,time to turn from these melancholy regions and seek the city of the
14450,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,blessed. They passed through a middle tract of darkness and came upon
14451,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the Elysian Fields, the groves where the happy reside. They breathed a"
14452,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,freer air and saw all objects clothed in a purple light. The region had
14453,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,a sun and stars of its own. The inhabitants were enjoying themselves in
14454,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"various ways, some in sports on the grassy turf, in games of strength"
14455,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"or skill, others dancing or singing. Orpheus struck the chords of his"
14456,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,lyre and called forth ravishing sounds. Here Æneas saw the founders
14457,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of the Trojan state, great-hearted heroes who lived in happier times."
14458,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,He gazed with admiration on the war chariots and glittering arms now
14459,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"reposing in disuse. Spears stood fixed in the ground, and the horses,"
14460,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"unharnessed, roamed over the plain. The same pride in splendid armor"
14461,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,and generous steeds which the old heroes felt in life accompanied them
14462,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,here. He saw another group feasting and listening to the strains of
14463,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"music. They were in a laurel grove, whence the great river Po has its"
14464,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,origin and flows out among men. Here dwelt those who fell by wounds
14465,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"received in their country's cause, holy priests also, and poets who"
14466,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"have uttered thoughts worthy of Apollo, and others who have contributed"
14467,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"to cheer and adorn life by their discoveries in the useful arts, and"
14468,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,have made their memory blessed by rendering service to mankind. They
14469,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,wore snow-white fillets about their brows. The Sibyl addressed a
14470,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,group of these and inquired where Anchises was to be found. They were
14471,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"directed where to seek him, and soon found him in a verdant valley,"
14472,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"where he was contemplating the ranks of his posterity, their destinies"
14473,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,and worthy deeds to be achieved in coming times. When he recognized
14474,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas approaching, he stretched out both hands to him, while tears"
14475,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"flowed freely. ""Dost thou come at last,"" said he, ""long expected, and"
14476,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"do I behold thee after such perils past? O my son, how have I trembled"
14477,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"for thee, as I have watched thy course!"" To which Æneas replied, ""O"
14478,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"father! thy image was always before me to guide and guard me."" Then he"
14479,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"endeavored to infold his father in his embrace, but his arms inclosed"
14480,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,only an unsubstantial shade.
14481,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14482,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,=257. The Valley of Oblivion.= Æneas perceived before him a spacious
14483,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"valley, with trees gently waving to the wind, a tranquil landscape,"
14484,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,through which the river Lethe flowed. Along the banks of the stream
14485,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"wandered a countless multitude, numerous as insects in the summer air."
14486,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Æneas, with surprise, inquired who were these. Anchises answered:"
14487,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"""They are souls to which bodies are to be given in due time. Meanwhile"
14488,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"they dwell on Lethe's bank and drink oblivion of their former lives."""
14489,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"""O father!"" said Æneas, ""is it possible that any can be so in love with"
14490,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"life as to wish to leave these tranquil seats for the upper world?"""
14491,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Anchises replied by explaining the plan of creation. The Creator, he"
14492,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"told him, originally made the material of which souls are composed, of"
14493,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the four elements, fire, air, earth, and water, all which when united"
14494,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"took the form of the most excellent part, fire, and became _flame_."
14495,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"This material was scattered like seed among the heavenly bodies, the"
14496,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"sun, moon, and stars. Of this seed the inferior gods created man and"
14497,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"all other animals, mingling it with various proportions of earth,"
14498,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,by which its purity was alloyed and reduced. Thus the more earth
14499,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"predominates in the composition, the less pure is the individual; and"
14500,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,we see that men and women with their full-grown bodies have not the
14501,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,purity of childhood. So in proportion to the time which the union of
14502,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"body and soul has lasted, is the impurity contracted by the spiritual"
14503,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"part. This impurity must be purged away after death, which is done"
14504,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"by ventilating the souls in the current of winds, or merging them in"
14505,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"water, or burning out their impurities by fire. Some few, of whom"
14506,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Anchises intimates that he is one, are admitted at once to Elysium,"
14507,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"there to remain. But the rest, after the impurities of earth are purged"
14508,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"away, are sent back to life endowed with new bodies, having had the"
14509,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,remembrance of their former lives effectually washed away by the waters
14510,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of Lethe. Some souls, however, there still are, so thoroughly corrupted"
14511,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"that they are not fit to be intrusted with human bodies, and these pass"
14512,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,by metempsychosis into the bodies of brute animals.
14513,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14514,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"Anchises, having explained so much, proceeded to point out to Æneas"
14515,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"individuals of his race who were hereafter to be born, and to relate"
14516,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,to him the exploits they should perform in the world. After this he
14517,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"reverted to the present, and told his son of the events that remained"
14518,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,to him to be accomplished before the complete establishment of himself
14519,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"and his followers in Italy. Wars were to be waged, battles fought, a"
14520,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"bride to be won, and, in the result, a Trojan state founded, from which"
14521,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"should rise the Roman power, to be in time the sovereign of the world."
14522,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14523,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"As Æneas and the Sibyl pursued their way back to earth, he said to"
14524,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"her: ""Whether thou be a goddess or a mortal beloved by the gods, by me"
14525,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"thou shalt always be held in reverence. When I reach the upper air, I"
14526,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"will cause a temple to be built to thy honor, and will myself bring"
14527,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"offerings."" ""I am no goddess,"" said the Sibyl; ""I have no claims to"
14528,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"sacrifice or offering. I am mortal, yet, could I but have accepted"
14529,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"the love of Apollo, I might have been immortal. He promised me the"
14530,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"fulfillment of my wish, if I would consent to be his. I took a handful"
14531,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"of sand and, holding it forth, said, 'Grant me to see as many birthdays"
14532,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,as there are sand-grains in my hand.' Unluckily I forgot to ask for
14533,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,enduring youth. This also he would have granted could I have accepted
14534,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"his love, but, offended at my refusal, he allowed me to grow old. My"
14535,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,youth and youthful strength fled long ago. I have lived seven hundred
14536,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"years, and to equal the number of the sand-grains I have still to see"
14537,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,three hundred springs and three hundred harvests. My body shrinks up as
14538,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"years increase, and in time I shall be lost to sight, but my voice will"
14539,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"remain, and future ages will respect my sayings."""
14540,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,
14541,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,These concluding words of the Sibyl alluded to her prophetic power. In
14542,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,her cave she was accustomed to inscribe on leaves gathered from the
14543,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,trees the names and fates of individuals. The leaves thus inscribed
14544,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"were arranged in order within the cave, and might be consulted by her"
14545,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"votaries. But if, perchance, at the opening of the door the wind rushed"
14546,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"in and dispersed the leaves, the Sibyl gave no aid to restoring them"
14547,ADVENTURES OF ÆNEAS,"again, and the oracle was irreparably lost."

14586,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"=258. The Fulfillment of Prophecy.= Æneas, having parted from the Sibyl"
14587,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"and rejoined his fleet, coasted along the shores of Italy and cast"
14588,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"anchor in the mouth of the Tiber. The poet, having brought his hero to"
14589,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"this spot, the destined termination of his wanderings, invokes his Muse"
14590,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"to tell him the situation of things at that eventful moment. Latinus,"
14591,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"third in descent from Saturn, ruled the country. He was now old and had"
14592,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"no male descendant, but had one charming daughter, Lavinia, who was"
14593,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"sought in marriage by many neighboring chiefs, one of whom, Turnus,"
14594,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"king of the Rutulians, was favored by the wishes of her parents. But"
14595,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Latinus had been warned in a dream by his father, Faunus, that the"
14596,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,destined husband of Lavinia should come from a foreign land. From that
14597,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,union should spring a race destined to subdue the world.
14598,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14599,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Our readers will remember that in the conflict with the harpies, one of"
14600,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,those half-human birds had threatened the Trojans with dire sufferings.
14601,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"In particular, she predicted that before their wanderings ceased they"
14602,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,should be pressed by hunger to devour their tables. This portent now
14603,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"came true; for as they took their scanty meal, seated on the grass, the"
14604,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,men placed their hard biscuit on their laps and put thereon whatever
14605,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"their gleanings in the woods supplied. Having dispatched the latter,"
14606,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"they finished by eating the crusts. Seeing which, the boy Iulus said"
14607,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"playfully, ""See! we are eating our tables."" Æneas caught the words and"
14608,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"accepted the omen. ""All hail, promised land!"" he exclaimed, ""this is"
14609,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"our home, this our country!"" He then took measures to find out who were"
14610,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,the present inhabitants of the land and who their rulers. A hundred
14611,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"chosen men were sent to the village of Latinus, bearing presents and"
14612,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,a request for friendship and alliance. They went and were favorably
14613,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,received. Latinus immediately concluded that the Trojan hero was
14614,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,no other than the promised son-in-law announced by the oracle. He
14615,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"cheerfully granted his alliance, and sent back the messengers mounted"
14616,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,on steeds from his stables and loaded with gifts and friendly messages.
14617,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14618,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Juno, seeing things go thus prosperously for the Trojans, felt her old"
14619,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"animosity revive, summoned Alecto from Erebus, and sent her to stir up"
14620,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"discord. The Fury first took possession of the queen, Amata, and roused"
14621,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,her to oppose in every way the new alliance. Alecto then sped to the
14622,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"city of Turnus and, assuming the form of an old priestess, informed him"
14623,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,of the arrival of the foreigners and of the attempts of their prince
14624,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,to rob him of his betrothed. Next she turned her attention to the camp
14625,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,of the Trojans. There she saw the boy Iulus and his companions amusing
14626,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,themselves with hunting. She sharpened the scent of the dogs and led
14627,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"them to rouse up from the thicket a tame stag, the favorite of Silvia,"
14628,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the daughter of Tyrrheus, the king's herdsman. A javelin from the"
14629,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"hand of Iulus wounded the animal, which had only strength left to run"
14630,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,homeward and die at its mistress's feet. Her cries and tears roused her
14631,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"brothers and the herdsmen, and they, seizing whatever weapons came to"
14632,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"hand, furiously assaulted the hunting party. These were protected by"
14633,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"their friends, and the herdsmen were finally driven back with the loss"
14634,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,of two of their number.
14635,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14636,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"These things were enough to rouse the storm of war, and the queen,"
14637,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Turnus, and the peasants all urged the old king to drive the strangers"
14638,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"from the country. He resisted as long as he could, but, finding his"
14639,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"opposition unavailing, finally gave way and retreated to his retirement."
14640,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14641,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"=259. The Gates of Janus Opened.= It was the custom of the country,"
14642,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"when war was to be undertaken, for the chief magistrate, clad in his"
14643,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"robes of office, with solemn pomp to open the gates of the temple"
14644,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"of Janus, which were kept shut as long as peace endured. His people"
14645,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"now urged the old king to perform that solemn office, but he refused"
14646,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"to do so. While they contested, Juno herself, descending from the"
14647,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"skies, smote the doors with irresistible force and burst them open."
14648,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,Immediately the whole country was in a flame. The people rushed from
14649,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"every side, breathing nothing but war."
14650,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14651,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Turnus was recognized by all as leader; others joined as allies, chief"
14652,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"of whom was Mezentius, a brave and able soldier, but of detestable"
14653,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"cruelty. He had been the chief of one of the neighboring cities,"
14654,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"but his people drove him out. With him was joined his son Lausus, a"
14655,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,generous youth worthy of a better sire.

14659,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"=260. Camilla.= Camilla, the favorite of Diana, a huntress and warrior"
14660,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"after the fashion of the Amazons, came with her band of mounted"
14661,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"followers, including a select number of her own sex, and ranged herself"
14662,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,on the side of Turnus. This maiden had never accustomed her fingers to
14663,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the distaff or the loom, but had learned to endure the toils of war and"
14664,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,in speed to outstrip the wind. It seemed as if she might run over the
14665,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"standing corn without crushing it, or over the surface of the water"
14666,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,without dipping her feet. Camilla's history had been singular from the
14667,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"beginning. Her father, Metabus, driven from his city by civil discord,"
14668,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,carried with him in his flight his infant daughter. As he fled through
14669,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the woods, his enemies in hot pursuit, he reached the bank of the river"
14670,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Amasenus, which, swelled by rains, seemed to debar a passage. He paused"
14671,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"for a moment, then decided what to do. He tied the infant to his lance"
14672,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"with wrappers of bark, and poising the weapon in his upraised hand,"
14673,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"thus addressed Diana: ""Goddess of the woods! I consecrate this maid to"
14674,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"thee""; then hurled the weapon with its burden to the opposite bank."
14675,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,The spear flew across the roaring water. His pursuers were already
14676,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"upon him, but he plunged into the river, and swam across, and found"
14677,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,the spear with the infant safe on the other side. Thenceforth he lived
14678,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,among the shepherds and brought up his daughter in woodland arts. While
14679,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,a child she was taught to use the bow and throw the javelin. With her
14680,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,sling she could bring down the crane or the wild swan. Her dress was a
14681,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"tiger's skin. Many mothers sought her for a daughter-in-law, but she"
14682,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,continued faithful to Diana and repelled the thought of marriage.
14683,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14684,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,=261. Alliance with Evander.= Such were the formidable allies that
14685,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"ranged themselves against Æneas. It was night, and he lay stretched in"
14686,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,sleep on the bank of the river under the open heavens. The god of the
14687,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"stream, Father Tiber, seemed to raise his head above the willows and"
14688,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"to say: ""O goddess-born, destined possessor of the Latin realms, this"
14689,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"is the promised land; here is to be thy home, here shall terminate the"
14690,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"hostility of the heavenly powers, if only thou faithfully persevere."
14691,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,There are friends not far distant. Prepare thy boats and row up my
14692,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"stream; I will lead thee to Evander, the Arcadian chief. He has long"
14693,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"been at strife with Turnus and the Rutulians, and is prepared to become"
14694,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,an ally of thine. Rise! offer thy vows to Juno and deprecate her anger.
14695,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"When thou hast achieved thy victory, then think of me."" Æneas woke"
14696,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,and paid immediate obedience to the friendly vision. He sacrificed to
14697,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Juno, and invoked the god of the river and all his tributary fountains"
14698,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,to lend their aid. Then for the first time a vessel filled with armed
14699,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,warriors floated on the stream of the Tiber. The river smoothed its
14700,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"waves and bade its current flow gently, while, impelled by the vigorous"
14701,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"strokes of the rowers, the vessel shot rapidly up the stream."
14702,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14703,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,About the middle of the day they came in sight of the scattered
14704,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,buildings of the infant town where in after times the proud city of
14705,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Rome grew, whose glory reached the skies. By chance the old king,"
14706,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Evander, was that day celebrating annual solemnities in honor of"
14707,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Hercules and all the gods. Pallas, his son, and all the chiefs of the"
14708,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,little commonwealth stood by. When they saw the tall ship gliding
14709,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"onward through the wood, they were alarmed at the sight and rose from"
14710,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the tables. But Pallas forbade the solemnities to be interrupted and,"
14711,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"seizing a weapon, stepped forward to the river's bank. He called aloud,"
14712,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"demanding who the strangers were and what their object. Æneas, holding"
14713,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"forth an olive branch, replied: ""We are Trojans, friends to you and"
14714,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,enemies to the Rutulians. We seek Evander and offer to join our arms
14715,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"with yours."" Pallas, in amaze at the sound of so great a name, invited"
14716,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"them to land, and when Æneas touched the shore, he seized his hand and"
14717,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,held it long in friendly grasp. Proceeding through the wood they joined
14718,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the king and his party, and were most favorably received. Seats were"
14719,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"provided for them at the tables, and the repast proceeded."
14720,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14721,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"=262. The Site of Future Rome.= When the solemnities were ended, all"
14722,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"moved towards the city. The king, bending with age, walked between his"
14723,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"son and Æneas, taking the arm of one or the other of them, and with"
14724,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,much variety of pleasing talk shortening the way. Æneas with delight
14725,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"looked and listened, observing all the beauties of the scene and"
14726,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"learning much of heroes renowned in ancient times. Evander said: ""These"
14727,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"extensive groves were once inhabited by fauns and nymphs, and a rude"
14728,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,race of men who sprang from the trees themselves and had neither laws
14729,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"nor social culture. They knew not how to yoke the cattle, nor raise"
14730,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"a harvest, nor provide from present abundance for future want, but"
14731,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,browsed like beasts upon the leafy boughs or fed voraciously on their
14732,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"hunted prey. Such were they when Saturn, expelled from Olympus by his"
14733,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"sons, came among them and drew together the fierce savages, formed them"
14734,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"into society, and gave them laws. Such peace and plenty ensued that men"
14735,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,ever since have called his reign the Golden Age; but by degrees far
14736,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"other times succeeded, and the thirst of gold and the thirst of blood"
14737,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,prevailed. The land was a prey to successive tyrants till fortune and
14738,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"resistless destiny brought me hither, an exile from my native land,"
14739,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Arcadia."""
14740,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14741,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Having thus said, he showed him the Tarpeian rock, and the rude spot,"
14742,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"then overgrown with bushes, where in after times the Capitol was to"
14743,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,rise in all its magnificence. He next pointed to some dismantled walls
14744,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"and said, ""Here stood Janiculum, built by Janus, and there Saturnia,"
14745,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the town of Saturn."" Such discourse brought them to the cottage of"
14746,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Evander, whence they saw the lowing herds roaming over the plain where"
14747,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"soon should stand the proud and stately Forum. They entered, and a"
14748,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"couch, well stuffed with leaves and covered with the skin of a Libyan"
14749,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"bear, was spread for Æneas."
14750,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14751,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Next morning, awakened by the dawn and the shrill song of birds beneath"
14752,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the eaves of his low mansion, old Evander rose. Clad in a tunic, and a"
14753,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"panther's skin thrown over his shoulders, with sandals on his feet and"
14754,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"his good sword girded to his side, he went forth to seek his guest. Two"
14755,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"mastiffs followed him,--his whole retinue and bodyguard. He found the"
14756,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"hero attended by his faithful Achates, and Pallas soon joining them,"
14757,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,the old king spoke thus:
14758,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14759,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"""Illustrious Trojan, it is but little we can do in so great a cause."
14760,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Our state is feeble, hemmed in on one side by the river, on the other"
14761,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,by the Rutulians. But I propose to ally thee with a people numerous
14762,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"and rich, to whom fate has brought thee at the propitious moment. The"
14763,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Etruscans hold the country beyond the river. Mezentius was their king,"
14764,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"a monster of cruelty, who invented unheard-of torments to gratify his"
14765,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"vengeance. He would fasten the dead to the living, hand to hand and"
14766,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"face to face, and leave the wretched victims to die in that dreadful"
14767,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"embrace. At length people cast him out, him and his house. They"
14768,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"burned his palace, and slew his friends. He escaped and took refuge"
14769,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"with Turnus, who protects him with arms. The Etruscans demand that"
14770,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"he shall be given up to deserved punishment, and would ere now have"
14771,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"attempted to enforce their demand; but their priests restrain them,"
14772,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,telling them that it is the will of heaven that no native of the land
14773,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,shall guide them to victory and that their destined leader must come
14774,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"from across the sea. They have offered the crown to me, but I am too"
14775,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"old to undertake such great affairs, and my son is native-born, which"
14776,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"precludes him from the choice. Thou, equally by birth and time of life"
14777,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"and fame in arms pointed out by the gods, hast but to appear to be"
14778,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"hailed at once as their leader. With thee I will join Pallas, my son,"
14779,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,my only hope and comfort. Under thee he shall learn the art of war and
14780,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"strive to emulate thy great exploits."""
14781,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14782,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Then the king ordered horses to be furnished for the Trojan chiefs,"
14783,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"and Æneas, with a chosen band of followers and Pallas accompanying,"
14784,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"mounted and took the way to the Etruscan city,[362] having sent back"
14785,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,the rest of his party in the ships. Æneas and his band safely arrived
14786,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,at the Etruscan camp and were received with open arms by Tarchon and
14787,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,his countrymen.
14788,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14789,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,=263. Turnus attacks the Trojan Camp.= In the meanwhile Turnus had
14790,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,collected his bands and made all necessary preparations for the war.
14791,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,Juno sent Iris to him with a message inciting him to take advantage
14792,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,of the absence of Æneas and surprise the Trojan camp. Accordingly the
14793,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"attempt was made; but the Trojans were found on their guard, and"
14794,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"having received strict orders from Æneas not to fight in his absence,"
14795,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,they lay still in their intrenchments and resisted all the efforts of
14796,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the Rutulians to draw them into the field. Night coming on, the army"
14797,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"of Turnus, in high spirits at their fancied superiority, feasted and"
14798,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"enjoyed themselves, and finally stretched themselves on the field and"
14799,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,slept secure.
14800,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14801,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,=264. Nisus and Euryalus.= In the camp of the Trojans things were far
14802,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"otherwise. There all was watchfulness and anxiety, and impatience for"
14803,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Æneas' return. Nisus stood guard at the entrance of the camp, and"
14804,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Euryalus, a youth distinguished above all in the army for graces of"
14805,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"person and fine qualities, was with him. These two were friends and"
14806,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"brothers in arms. Nisus said to his friend: ""Dost thou perceive what"
14807,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,confidence and carelessness the enemy display? Their lights are few and
14808,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"dim, and the men seem all oppressed with wine or sleep. Thou knowest"
14809,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,how anxiously our chiefs wish to send to Æneas and to get intelligence
14810,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,from him. Now I am strongly moved to make my way through the enemy's
14811,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"camp and to go in search of our chief. If I succeed, the glory of"
14812,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the deed will be reward enough for me, and if they judge the service"
14813,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"deserves anything more, let them pay it thee."""
14814,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14815,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Euryalus, all on fire with the love of adventure, replied: ""Wouldst"
14816,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"thou then, Nisus, refuse to share thy enterprise with me? And shall"
14817,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,I let thee go into such danger alone? Not so my brave father brought
14818,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"me up, nor so have I planned for myself when I joined the standard of"
14819,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Æneas and resolved to hold my life cheap in comparison with honor."""
14820,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Nisus replied: ""I doubt it not, my friend; but thou knowest the"
14821,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"uncertain event of such an undertaking, and whatever may happen to"
14822,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"me, I wish thee to be safe. Thou art younger than I and hast more of"
14823,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"life in prospect. Nor can I be the cause of such grief to thy mother,"
14824,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,who has chosen to be here in the camp with thee rather than stay and
14825,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"live in peace with the other matrons in Acestes' city."" Euryalus"
14826,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"replied, ""Say no more. In vain dost thou seek arguments to dissuade"
14827,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,me. I am fixed in the resolution to go with thee. Let us lose no
14828,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"time."" They called the guard and, committing the watch to them, sought"
14829,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the general's tent. They found the chief officers in consultation,"
14830,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,deliberating how they should send notice to Æneas of their situation.
14831,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"The offer of the two friends was gladly accepted, themselves loaded"
14832,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,with praises and promised the most liberal rewards in case of success.
14833,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Iulus especially addressed Euryalus, assuring him of his lasting"
14834,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"friendship. Euryalus replied: ""I have but one boon to ask. My aged"
14835,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,mother is with me in the camp. For me she left the Trojan soil and
14836,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,would not stay behind with the other matrons at the city of Acestes. I
14837,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,go now without taking leave of her. I could not bear her tears nor set
14838,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"at naught her entreaties. But do thou, I beseech thee, comfort her in"
14839,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,her distress. Promise me that and I shall go more boldly into whatever
14840,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"dangers may present themselves."" Iulus and the other chiefs were moved"
14841,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"to tears and promised to do all his request. ""Thy mother shall be"
14842,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"mine,"" said Iulus, ""and all that I have promised thee shall be made"
14843,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"good to her, if thou dost not return to receive it."""
14844,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14845,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,The two friends left the camp and plunged at once into the midst of the
14846,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"enemy. They found no watch, no sentinels posted, but, all about, the"
14847,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,sleeping soldiers strewn on the grass and among the wagons. The laws
14848,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,of war at that early day did not forbid a brave man to slay a sleeping
14849,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"foe, and the two Trojans slew, as they passed, such of the enemy as"
14850,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,they could without exciting alarm. In one tent Euryalus made prize of
14851,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,a helmet brilliant with gold and plumes. They had passed through the
14852,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"enemy's ranks without being discovered, but now suddenly appeared a"
14853,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"troop directly in front of them, which, under Volscens, their leader,"
14854,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,were approaching the camp. The glittering helmet of Euryalus caught
14855,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"their attention, and Volscens hailed the two and demanded who and"
14856,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"whence they were. They made no answer, but plunged into the wood. The"
14857,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,horsemen scattered in all directions to intercept their flight. Nisus
14858,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"had eluded pursuit and was out of danger, but, since Euryalus was"
14859,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"missing, he turned back to seek him. He again entered the wood and soon"
14860,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,came within sound of voices. Looking through the thicket he saw the
14861,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,whole band surrounding Euryalus with noisy questions. What should he
14862,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,do; how extricate the youth; or would it be better to die with him?
14863,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14864,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Raising his eyes to the moon which now shone clear, he said, ""Goddess,"
14865,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"favor my effort!"" and, aiming his javelin at one of the leaders of the"
14866,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"troop, struck him in the back and stretched him on the plain with a"
14867,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"deathblow. In the midst of their amazement another weapon flew, and"
14868,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"another of the party fell dead. Volscens, the leader, ignorant whence"
14869,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the darts came, rushed sword in hand upon Euryalus. ""Thou shalt pay"
14870,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the penalty of both,"" he said, and would have plunged the sword into"
14871,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"his bosom, when Nisus, who from his concealment saw the peril of his"
14872,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"friend, rushed forward exclaiming, ""'T was I! 't was I! Turn your"
14873,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"swords against me, Rutulians. I did it; he only followed me as a"
14874,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"friend."" While he spoke the sword fell and pierced the comely bosom of"
14875,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Euryalus. His head fell over on his shoulder, like a flower cut down"
14876,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,by the plow. Nisus rushed upon Volscens and plunged his sword into his
14877,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"body, and was himself slain on the instant by numberless blows."
14878,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14879,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"=265. The Death of Mezentius.= Æneas, with his Etrurian allies, arrived"
14880,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,on the scene of action in time to rescue his beleaguered camp; and now
14881,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the two armies being nearly equal in strength, the war began in good"
14882,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"earnest. We cannot find space for all the details, but must simply"
14883,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"record the fate of the principal characters. The tyrant Mezentius,"
14884,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"finding himself engaged against his revolted subjects, raged like a"
14885,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"wild beast. He slew all who dared withstand him, and put the multitude"
14886,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"to flight wherever he appeared. At last he encountered Æneas, and the"
14887,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"armies stood still to see the issue. Mezentius threw his spear, which,"
14888,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"striking Æneas' shield, glanced off and hit Antores,--a Grecian by"
14889,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"birth who had left Argos, his native city, and followed Evander into"
14890,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Italy. The poet says of him, with simple pathos which has made the"
14891,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"words proverbial, ""He fell, unhappy, by a wound intended for another,"
14892,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"looked up to the skies, and, dying, remembered sweet Argos.""[363] Æneas"
14893,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,now in turn hurled his lance. It pierced the shield of Mezentius and
14894,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"wounded him in the thigh. Lausus, his son, could not bear the sight,"
14895,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"but rushed forward and interposed himself, while the followers pressed"
14896,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,round Mezentius and bore him away. Æneas held his sword suspended over
14897,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Lausus and delayed to strike, but the furious youth pressed on, and he"
14898,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"was compelled to deal the fatal blow. Lausus fell, and Æneas bent over"
14899,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"him in pity. ""Hapless youth,"" he said, ""what can I do for thee worthy"
14900,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"of thy praise? Keep those arms in which thou gloriest, and fear not"
14901,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,but that thy body shall be restored to thy friends and have due funeral
14902,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"honors."" So saying, he called the timid followers and delivered the"
14903,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,body into their hands.
14904,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14905,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Mezentius meanwhile had been borne to the riverside, and had washed"
14906,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"his wound. Soon the news reached him of Lausus' death, and rage and"
14907,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,despair supplied the place of strength. He mounted his horse and dashed
14908,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"into the thickest of the fight, seeking Æneas. Having found him, he"
14909,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"rode round him in a circle, throwing one javelin after another, while"
14910,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Æneas stood fenced with his shield, turning every way to meet them."
14911,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"At last after Mezentius had three times made the circuit, Æneas threw"
14912,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,his lance directly at the horse's head. The animal fell with pierced
14913,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"temples, while a shout from both armies rent the skies. Mezentius asked"
14914,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"no mercy, but only that his body might be spared the insults of his"
14915,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,revolted subjects and be buried in the same grave with his son. He
14916,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"received the fatal stroke not unprepared, and poured out his life and"
14917,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,his blood together.
14918,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14919,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,=266. The Deaths of Pallas and Camilla.= While these things were doing
14920,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"in one part of the field, in another Turnus encountered the youthful"
14921,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,Pallas. The contest between champions so unequally matched could not be
14922,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"doubtful. Pallas bore himself bravely, but fell by the lance of Turnus."
14923,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,The victor almost relented when he saw the brave youth lying dead at
14924,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"his feet, and spared to use the privilege of a conqueror in despoiling"
14925,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"him of his arms. The belt only, adorned with studs and carvings of"
14926,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"gold, he took and clasped round his own body. The rest he remitted to"
14927,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,the friends of the slain.
14928,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14929,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,After the battle there was a cessation of arms for some days to allow
14930,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,both armies to bury their dead. In this interval Æneas challenged
14931,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Turnus to decide the contest by single combat, but Turnus evaded the"
14932,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"challenge. Another battle ensued, in which Camilla, the virgin warrior,"
14933,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,was chiefly conspicuous. Her deeds of valor surpassed those of the
14934,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"bravest warriors, and many Trojans and Etruscans fell pierced with her"
14935,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"darts or struck down by her battle-ax. At last an Etruscan named Aruns,"
14936,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"who had watched her long, seeking for some advantage, observed her"
14937,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,pursuing an enemy whose splendid armor offered a tempting prize. Intent
14938,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"on the chase she observed not her danger, and the javelin of Aruns"
14939,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,struck her and inflicted a fatal wound. She fell and breathed her last
14940,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"in the arms of her attendant maidens. But Diana, who beheld her fate,"
14941,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"suffered not her slaughter to be unavenged. Aruns, as he stole away"
14942,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"glad but frightened, was struck by a secret arrow, launched by one of"
14943,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the nymphs of Diana's train, and he died ignobly and unknown."
14944,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14945,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,=267. The Final Conflict.= At length the final conflict took place
14946,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,between Æneas and Turnus. Turnus had avoided the contest as long as
14947,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"he could; but at last, impelled by the ill success of his arms and by"
14948,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"the murmurs of his followers, he braced himself to the conflict. The"
14949,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,outcome could not be doubtful. On the side of Æneas were the expressed
14950,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"decree of destiny, the aid of his goddess-mother in every emergency,"
14951,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"and impenetrable armor fabricated by Vulcan, at her request, for her"
14952,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"son. Turnus, on the other hand, was deserted by his celestial allies,"
14953,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,Juno having been expressly forbidden by Jupiter to assist him any
14954,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"longer. Turnus threw his lance, but it recoiled harmless from the"
14955,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"shield of Æneas. The Trojan hero then threw his, which, penetrating the"
14956,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"shield of Turnus, pierced his thigh. Then Turnus' fortitude forsook"
14957,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"him, and he begged for mercy; Æneas, indeed, would have spared his"
14958,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"opponent's life, but at the instant his eye fell on the belt of Pallas,"
14959,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,which Turnus had taken from the slaughtered youth. Instantly his rage
14960,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"revived, and exclaiming, ""Pallas immolates thee with this blow,"" he"
14961,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,thrust him through with his sword.
14962,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,
14963,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Here the poem of the Æneid closes, and we are left to infer that"
14964,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Æneas, having triumphed over his foes, obtained Lavinia for his bride."
14965,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"Tradition adds that he founded a city and called it Lavinium, after her"
14966,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,"name. His son Iulus founded Alba Longa, which became the birthplace of"
14967,THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS,Romulus and Remus and the cradle of Rome.

14991,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"above nor earth beneath, but only a bottomless deep, Ginungagap, and"
14992,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"a world of mist, Niflheim, in which sprang a fountain. Twelve rivers"
14993,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"issued from this fountain, Vergelmir, and when they had flowed far from"
14994,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"their source, they froze into ice, and one layer accumulating over"
14995,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"another, the great deep was filled up."
14996,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
14997,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Southward from the world of mist was the world of light, Muspelheim."
14998,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],From this proceeded a warm wind upon the ice and melted it. The
14999,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"vapors rose in the air and formed clouds, from which sprang Ymir, the"
15000,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"rime-cold giant and his progeny, and the cow Audhumbla, whose milk"
15001,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],afforded nourishment and food to the giant. The cow got nourishment
15002,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],by licking the hoar frost and salt from the ice. While she was one
15003,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],day licking the salt stones there appeared at first the hair of some
15004,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"being, on the second day his whole head, and on the third the entire"
15005,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"form endowed with beauty, agility, and power. This new being was a god,"
15006,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Bori, from whom and his wife, a daughter of the giant race, sprang Bor,"
15007,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the father of Odin, Vili, and Ve. These three slew the giant Ymir, and"
15008,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"out of his body formed the earth, of his blood the seas, of his bones"
15009,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the mountains, of his hair the trees, of his skull the heavens, and of"
15010,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"his brain clouds, charged with hail and snow. Of Ymir's eyebrows the"
15011,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],gods built a fence around the Midgard or mid-earth between Niflheim and
15012,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Muspelheim, destined to become the abode of man."
15013,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15014,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Odin then regulated the periods of day and night and the seasons by
15015,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"placing in the heavens the sun and moon, and appointing to them their"
15016,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],respective courses. As soon as the sun began to shed its rays upon
15017,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the earth, it caused the vegetable world to bud and sprout. Shortly"
15018,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"after the gods (the Anse-race, Anses, Æsir, or Asa-folk) had created"
15019,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the world, they walked by the side of the sea, pleased with their new"
15020,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"work, but found that it was still incomplete, for it was without human"
15021,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],beings. They therefore took an ashen spar and made a man out of it;
15022,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],woman they made out of a piece of elm; and they called the man Ask and
15023,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the woman Embla. Odin then gave them life and soul, Vili reason and"
15024,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"motion, and Ve bestowed upon them the senses, expressive features, and"
15025,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"speech. Midgard was given them as their residence, and they became the"
15026,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],progenitors of the human race.

15028,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"=269. Yggdrasil.= The mighty ash tree, Yggdrasil, was supposed to"
15029,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"support the whole universe. It sprang from the body of Ymir, and had"
15030,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"three immense roots, extending one into Midgard (the dwelling of"
15031,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"mortals), another into Jötunheim (the abode of the giants), and the"
15032,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"third below Niflheim, into the region of Death. By the side of each"
15033,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"of these roots is a spring, from which it is watered. The root that"
15034,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"extends into Midgard is carefully tended by the three Norns,--goddesses"
15035,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"who are regarded as the dispensers of fate. They are Urd (the past),"
15036,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Verdandi (the present), Skuld (the future). The spring at the Jötunheim"
15037,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"side is Mimir's well, in which wisdom and wit lie hidden, but that"
15038,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"below Niflheim refreshes also the dark dragon of despair, Nidhogg (the"
15039,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"back-biter), which perpetually gnaws at the root. Four harts run across"
15040,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the branches of the tree and nip the buds; they represent the four
15041,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"winds. Under the tree lies Ymir, and when he tries to shake off its"
15042,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"weight the earth quakes. The boughs overshadow the earth, and the top"
15043,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],rises into Asgard in the zenith.

15045,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"=270. Odin and his Valhalla.= To Asgard, the abode of the gods,"
15046,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"access is gained only by crossing the bridge, Bifrost (the rainbow)."
15047,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Asgard--Gladsheim for the gods, Vingolf for the goddesses--consists of"
15048,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"golden and silver palaces; but the most beautiful of these is Valhalla,"
15049,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the great hall of Odin. When seated on his throne he overlooks
15050,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"heaven and earth. Beside him sits _Frigga_ (or _Fricka_), his wife,"
15051,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"who knows all things. Upon his shoulders are the ravens, Hugin and"
15052,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Munin,--Thought and Memory,--who fly every day over the whole world,"
15053,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and on their return report to him what they have seen and heard. At his
15054,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"feet lie his two wolves, Geri and Freki, to whom Odin gives the meat"
15055,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"that is set before him, for he himself stands in no need of food. Mead"
15056,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],is for him both food and drink. He invented the Runic characters; the

15065,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Odin is frequently called Alfadur (Allfather), but this name is"
15066,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],sometimes used in a way that shows that the Scandinavians had an idea
15067,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"of a deity superior to Odin, uncreated and eternal. In Valhalla Odin"
15068,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"feasts with his chosen heroes, all those who have fallen bravely in"
15069,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"battle, for all who die a peaceful death are excluded. The flesh of"
15070,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the boar Serimnir is served up to them and is abundant for all. For
15071,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"although this boar is cooked every morning, he becomes whole again"
15072,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],every night. For drink the heroes are supplied abundantly with mead
15073,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"from the she-goat Heidrun. When the heroes are not feasting, they amuse"
15074,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],themselves with fighting. Every day they ride out into the court or
15075,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],field and fight until they cut each other in pieces. This is their
15076,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"pastime; but when mealtime comes, they recover from their wounds and"

15084,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Valkyries, Choosers of the Slain, are his messengers. Later they are"

15091,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Odin's eldest son, is the strongest of gods and men, and possesses"
15092,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"three precious things. The first is a hammer, which both the Frost and"

15095,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"a skull of their fathers and kindred. When thrown, it returns to his"
15096,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],hand of its own accord. The second rare thing he possesses is the belt
15097,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],of strength. When he girds it about him his divine might is doubled.

15127,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],calumniator of the gods and the contriver of all fraud and mischief. He
15128,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"is the son of Farbauti, the Charon of Norse mythology. He is handsome"
15129,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and well made, but of fickle mood and evil disposition. Although of"
15130,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the demon race, he forced himself into the company of the gods, and"

15136,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],much evil upon gods and men. So Odin deemed it advisable to send one

15138,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],ocean by which the earth is surrounded. But the monster has grown to
15139,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"such an enormous size that, holding his tail in his mouth, he encircles"
15140,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the whole earth. Hela he hurled below Niflheim and gave her power over
15141,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"nine worlds or regions, in which she distributes those who are sent to"
15142,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"her,--that is, all who die of sickness or old age. Her hall is called"
15143,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Eliudnir, or Sleet-den. Hunger is her table, Starvation her knife,"
15144,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Delay her man, Slowness her maid, Pale Woe her door, Stumbling-stone"
15145,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"her threshold, Care her bed; and Falling-peril forms the hangings of"
15146,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"her apartments. She may easily be recognized, for her body is half"
15147,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"flesh color and half blue, and she presents a stern and forbidding"
15148,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],countenance.
15149,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15150,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],The wolf Fenris gave the gods a great deal of trouble before they
15151,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],succeeded in chaining him. He broke the strongest fetters as if
15152,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],they were made of cobwebs. Finally the gods sent a messenger to the
15153,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"mountain spirits, who made for them the chain called Gleipnir. It is"
15154,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"fashioned of six things,--the noise made by the footfall of a cat, the"
15155,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"beards of women, the roots of stones, the breath of fishes, the nerves"
15156,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"(sensibilities) of bears, and the spittle of birds. When finished it"
15157,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],was as smooth and soft as a silken string. But when the gods asked the
15158,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"wolf to suffer himself to be bound with this apparently slight ribbon,"
15159,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"he suspected their design, fearing that it was made by enchantment. He"
15160,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],therefore consented to be bound with it only upon condition that one of
15161,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the gods put his hand in his (Fenris') mouth as a pledge that the band
15162,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],was to be removed again. Tyr alone had courage enough to do this. But
15163,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],when the wolf found that he could not break his fetters and that the
15164,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"gods would not release him, he bit off Tyr's hand. Tyr, consequently,"
15165,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],has ever since remained one-handed.
15166,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15167,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],=274. The Conflict with the Mountain Giants.= When the gods were
15168,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],constructing their abodes and had already finished Midgard and
15169,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Valhalla, a certain artificer came and offered to build them a"
15170,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],residence so well fortified that they should be perfectly safe from the
15171,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],incursions of the Frost giants and the giants of the mountains. But he
15172,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"demanded for his reward the goddess Freya, together with the sun and"
15173,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"moon. The gods yielded to the terms, provided that the artificer would"
15174,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"finish the whole work without any one's assistance, and all within the"
15175,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],space of one winter. But if anything remained unfinished on the first
15176,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"day of summer, he should forfeit the recompense agreed on. On being"
15177,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"told these terms, the artificer stipulated that he be allowed the use"
15178,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"of his horse Svadilfari, and this request, by the advice of Loki,"
15179,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"was conceded. He accordingly set to work on the first day of winter,"
15180,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and during the night let his horse draw stone for the building. The
15181,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"enormous size of the stones struck the gods with astonishment, and they"
15182,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],saw clearly that the horse did one half more of the toilsome work than
15183,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"his master. Their bargain, however, had been concluded and confirmed"
15184,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"by solemn oaths, for without these precautions a giant would not have"
15185,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"thought himself safe among the gods,--still less, indeed, if Thor"
15186,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],should return from the expedition he had then undertaken against the
15187,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],evil demons.
15188,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15189,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"As the winter drew to a close the building was far advanced, and"
15190,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the bulwarks were sufficiently high and massive to render the place
15191,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"impregnable. In short, when it wanted but three days to summer, the"
15192,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],only part that remained to be finished was the gateway. Then sat the
15193,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"gods on their seats of justice and entered into consultation, inquiring"
15194,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],of one another who among them could have advised the rest to surrender
15195,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Freya, or to plunge the heavens in darkness by permitting the giant to"
15196,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],carry away the sun and the moon.
15197,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15198,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"They all agreed that no one but Loki, the author of so many evil"
15199,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"deeds, could have given such counsel, and that he should be put to"
15200,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],a cruel death unless he contrived some way to prevent the artificer
15201,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],from completing his task and obtaining the stipulated recompense. They
15202,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"proceeded to lay hands on Loki, who in his fright promised upon oath"
15203,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"that, let it cost him what it might, he would so manage matters that"
15204,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the man should lose his reward. That night when the man went with
15205,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Svadilfari for building-stone, a mare suddenly ran out of a forest and"
15206,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],began to neigh. The horse thereat broke loose and ran after the mare
15207,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"into the forest, obliging the man also to run after his horse; thus,"
15208,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"therefore, between one and another the whole night was lost, so that at"
15209,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"dawn the work had not made the usual progress. The man, seeing that he"
15210,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"must fail of completing his task, resumed his own gigantic stature, and"
15211,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the gods now clearly perceived that it was in reality a mountain giant
15212,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"who had come amongst them. Feeling no longer bound by their oaths, they"
15213,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"called on Thor, who immediately ran to their assistance and, lifting"
15214,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"up his mallet, paid the workman his wages, not with the sun and moon,"
15215,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and not even by sending him back to Jötunheim, for with the first blow"
15216,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],he shattered the giant's skull to pieces and hurled him headlong into
15217,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Niflheim.
15218,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15219,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],=275. The Recovery of Thor's Hammer.= Soon afterward it happened that
15220,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor's hammer fell into the possession of the giant Thrym, who buried"
15221,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],it eight fathoms deep under the rocks of Jötunheim. Thor sent Loki to
15222,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"negotiate with Thrym, but he could only prevail so far as to get the"
15223,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],giant's promise to restore the weapon if Freya would consent to be his
15224,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"bride. Loki returned and reported the result of his mission, but the"
15225,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],goddess of love was horrified at the idea of bestowing her charms on
15226,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the king of the Frost giants. In this emergency Loki persuaded Thor to
15227,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],dress himself in Freya's clothes and accompany him to Jötunheim. Thrym
15228,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"received his veiled bride with due courtesy, but was greatly surprised"
15229,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],at seeing her eat for her supper eight salmon and a full-grown ox
15230,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"besides other delicacies, washing the whole down with three tuns of"
15231,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"mead. Loki, however, assured him that she had not tasted anything"
15232,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"for eight long nights, so great was her desire to see her lover, the"
15233,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],renowned ruler of Jötunheim. Thrym had at last the curiosity to peep
15234,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"under his bride's veil, but started back in affright, and demanded why"
15235,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Freya's eyeballs glistened with fire. Loki repeated the same excuse,"
15236,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and the giant was satisfied. He ordered the hammer to be brought in
15237,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and laid on the maiden's lap. Thereupon Thor threw off his disguise,"
15238,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"grasped his redoubted weapon, and slaughtered Thrym and all his"
15239,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],followers.
15240,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15241,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"=276. Thor's Visit to Jötunheim.= One day Thor, with his servant"
15242,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thialfi and accompanied by Loki, set out for the giants' country."
15243,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Thialfi was of all men the swiftest of foot. He bore Thor's wallet
15244,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],containing their provisions. When night came on they found themselves
15245,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"in an immense forest, and searched on all sides for a place where"
15246,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"they might pass the night. At last they came to a large hall, with"
15247,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],an entrance that took the whole breadth of one end of the building.
15248,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Here they lay down to sleep, but towards midnight were alarmed by an"
15249,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"earthquake which shook the whole edifice. Thor, rising up, called on"
15250,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],his companions to seek with him a place of safety. On the right they
15251,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"found an adjoining chamber into which the others entered, but Thor"
15252,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"remained at the doorway with his mallet in his hand, prepared to defend"
15253,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],himself whatever might happen. A terrible groaning was heard during
15254,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the night, and at dawn of day Thor went out and found lying near him a"
15255,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"huge giant, still snoring in the way that had alarmed them. For once"
15256,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor was afraid to use his mallet, and as the giant soon waked up, Thor"
15257,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],contented himself with simply asking his name.
15258,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15259,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""My name is Skrymir,"" said the giant, ""but I need not ask thy name, for"
15260,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"I know that thou art the god Thor. But what has become of my glove?"""
15261,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Thor then perceived that what they had taken overnight for a hall was
15262,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the giant's glove, and the chamber where his two companions had sought"
15263,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],refuge was the thumb. Skrymir then proposed that they should travel in
15264,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"company, and Thor consenting, they sat down to eat their breakfast."
15265,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"When they had done, Skrymir packed all the provisions into one wallet,"
15266,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"threw it over his shoulder, and strode on before them, taking such"
15267,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],tremendous strides that they were hard put to it to keep up with him.
15268,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"So they traveled the whole day, and at dusk Skrymir chose a place for"
15269,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],them to pass the night in under a large oak tree. Skrymir then told
15270,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"them he would lie down to sleep. ""But take ye the wallet,"" he added,"
15271,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""and prepare your supper."""
15272,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15273,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Skrymir soon fell asleep and began to snore strongly, but when Thor"
15274,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"tried to open the wallet, he found the giant had tied it up so tight he"
15275,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"could not untie a single knot. At last Thor became wroth, and grasping"
15276,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"his mallet with both hands, he struck a furious blow on the giant's"
15277,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"head. Skrymir, awakening, merely asked whether a leaf had not fallen on"
15278,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"his head, and whether they had supped and were ready to go to sleep."
15279,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor answered that they were just going to sleep, and so saying went"
15280,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and laid himself down under another tree. But sleep came not that
15281,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"night to Thor, and when Skrymir snored again so loud that the forest"
15282,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"reëchoed with the noise, he arose, and, grasping his mallet, launched"
15283,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],it with such force at the giant's skull that it made a deep dint in
15284,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"it. Skrymir, awakening, cried out: ""What's the matter? Are there any"
15285,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],birds perched on this tree? I felt some moss from the branches fall on
15286,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"my head. How fares it with thee, Thor?"" But Thor went away hastily,"
15287,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"saying that he had just then awoke, and, that as it was only midnight,"
15288,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"there was still time for sleep. He, however, resolved that if he had"
15289,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"an opportunity of striking a third blow, it should settle all matters"
15290,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],between them. A little before daybreak he perceived that Skrymir was
15291,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"again fast asleep, and again grasping his mallet, he dashed it with"
15292,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],such violence that it forced its way into the giant's skull up to the
15293,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"handle. But Skrymir sat up, and, stroking his cheek, said: ""An acorn"
15294,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"fell on my head. What! Art thou awake, Thor? Methinks it is time for"
15295,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],us to get up and dress ourselves; but you have not now a long way
15296,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],before you to the city called Utgard. I have heard you whispering to
15297,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"one another that I am not a man of small dimensions, but if you come"
15298,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"to Utgard, you will see there many men much taller than I. Wherefore I"
15299,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"advise you, when you come there, not to make too much of yourselves;"
15300,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],for the followers of Utgard-Loki will not brook the boasting of such
15301,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],little fellows as you are. You must take the road that leads eastward;
15302,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"mine lies northward, so we must part here."""
15303,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15304,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Hereupon he threw his wallet over his shoulders and turned away from
15305,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"them into the forest, and Thor had no wish to stop him or to ask for"
15306,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],any more of his company.
15307,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15308,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor and his companions proceeded on their way, and towards noon"
15309,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],descried a city standing in the middle of a plain. It was so lofty that
15310,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],they were obliged to bend their necks quite back on their shoulders in
15311,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"order to see to the top of it. On arriving they entered the city, and"
15312,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"seeing a large palace before them with the door wide open, they went"
15313,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"in and found a number of men of prodigious stature, sitting on benches"
15314,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"in the hall. Going further, they came before the king Utgard-Loki,"
15315,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"whom they saluted with great respect. The king, regarding them with a"
15316,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"scornful smile, said, ""If I do not mistake me, that stripling yonder"
15317,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"must be the god Thor."" Then addressing himself to Thor, he said:"
15318,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Perhaps thou mayst be more than thou appearest to be. What are the"
15319,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],feats that thou and thy fellows deem yourselves skilled in?--for no one
15320,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"is permitted to remain here who does not, in some feat or other, excel"
15321,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"all other men."""
15322,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15323,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""The feat that I know,"" said Loki, ""is to eat quicker than any one"
15324,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"else, and in this I am ready to give a proof against any one here who"
15325,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"may choose to compete with me."""
15326,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15327,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""That will indeed be a feat, if thou performest what thou promisest,"""
15328,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"said Utgard-Loki, ""and it shall be tried forthwith."""
15329,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15330,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"He then ordered one of his men, who was sitting at the farther end of"
15331,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the bench and whose name was Logi, to come forward and try his skill"
15332,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"with Loki. A trough filled with meat having been set on the hall floor,"
15333,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Loki placed himself at one end and Logi at the other, and each of them"
15334,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"began to eat as fast as he could, until they met in the middle of the"
15335,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"trough. But it was found that Loki had only eaten the flesh, while his"
15336,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"adversary had devoured both flesh and bone, and the trough to boot."
15337,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],All the company therefore adjudged that Loki was vanquished.
15338,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15339,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Utgard-Loki then asked what feat the young man who accompanied Thor
15340,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],could perform. Thialfi answered that he would run a race with any
15341,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],one who might be matched against him. The king observed that skill
15342,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"in running was something to boast of, but if the youth would win the"
15343,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"match, he must display great agility. He then arose and went, with all"
15344,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"who were present, to a plain where there was good ground for running"
15345,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"on, and calling a young man named Hugi, bade him run a match with"
15346,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Thialfi. In the first course Hugi so much outstripped his competitor
15347,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],that he turned back and met him not far from the starting-place. Then
15348,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"they ran a second and a third time, but Thialfi met with no better"
15349,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],success.
15350,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15351,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Utgard-Loki then asked Thor in what feats he would choose to give
15352,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],proofs of that prowess for which he was so famous. Thor answered that
15353,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],he would try a drinking-match with any one. Utgard-Loki bade his
15354,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],cupbearer bring the large horn which his followers were obliged to
15355,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],empty when they had trespassed in any way against the law of the feast.
15356,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"The cupbearer having presented it to Thor, Utgard-Loki said, ""Whoever"
15357,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"is a good drinker will empty that horn at a single draft, though most"
15358,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"men make two of it; but the most puny drinker can do it in three."""

15360,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor looked at the horn, which seemed of no extraordinary size, though"
15361,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"somewhat long; however, as he was very thirsty, he set it to his lips"
15362,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and, without drawing breath, pulled as long and as deeply as he could,"
15363,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],that he might not be obliged to make a second draft of it; but when he
15364,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"set the horn down and looked in, he could scarcely perceive that the"

15366,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15367,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"After taking breath, Thor went to it again with all his might, but when"
15368,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"he took the horn from his mouth, it seemed to him that he had drank"
15369,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"rather less than before, although the horn could now be carried without"

15373,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"thou meanest to drain the horn at the third draft, thou must pull"
15374,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],deeply; and I must needs say that thou wilt not be called so mighty
15375,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],a man here as thou art at home if thou showest no greater prowess in

15379,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"empty it; but on looking in found the liquor was only a little lower,"
15380,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"so he resolved to make no further attempt, but gave back the horn to"
15381,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the cupbearer.

15383,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""I now see plainly,"" said Utgard-Loki, ""that thou art not quite so"

15386,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15387,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""What new trial hast thou to propose?"" said Thor."
15388,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15389,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""We have a very trifling game here,"" answered Utgard-Loki, ""in which we"
15390,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],exercise none but children. It consists in merely lifting my cat from
15391,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the ground; nor should I have dared to mention such a feat to the great
15392,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Thor if I had not already observed that thou art by no means what we
15393,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"took thee for."""
15394,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15395,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],As he finished speaking a large gray cat sprang on the hall floor. Thor
15396,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],put his hand under the cat's belly and did his utmost to raise him from
15397,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the floor, but the cat, bending his back, had, notwithstanding all"
15398,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor's efforts, only one of his feet lifted up, seeing which Thor made"
15399,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],no further attempt.

15401,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""This trial has turned out,"" said Utgard-Loki, ""just as I imagined it"
15402,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"would. The cat is large, but Thor is little in comparison to our men."""

15409,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"let somebody, however, call hither that old crone, my nurse Elli, and"
15410,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],let Thor wrestle with her if he will. She has thrown to the ground many

15412,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15413,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"A toothless old woman then entered the hall, and was told by"
15414,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Utgard-Loki to take hold of Thor. The tale is shortly told. The more
15415,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor tightened his hold on the crone the firmer she stood. At length,"
15416,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"after a very violent struggle, Thor began to lose his footing, and"
15417,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],was finally brought down upon one knee. Utgard-Loki then told them to
15418,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"desist, adding that Thor had now no occasion to ask any one else in the"
15419,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"hall to wrestle with him, and it was also getting late; so he showed"
15420,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thor and his companions to their seats, and they passed the night there"
15421,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],in good cheer.
15422,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15423,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"The next morning, at break of day, Thor and his companions dressed"
15424,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],themselves and prepared for their departure. Utgard-Loki ordered a
15425,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"table to be set for them, on which there was no lack of victuals or"
15426,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"drink. After the repast Utgard-Loki led them to the gate of the city,"
15427,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and on parting asked Thor how he thought his journey had turned out and
15428,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],whether he had met with any men stronger than himself. Thor told him
15429,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],that he could not deny but that he had brought great shame on himself.
15430,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""And what grieves me most,"" he added, ""is that ye will call me a person"

15432,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15433,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Nay,"" said Utgard-Loki, ""it behooves me to tell thee the truth, now"
15434,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"thou art out of the city, which so long as I live and have my way thou"
15435,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"shalt never enter again. And, by my troth, had I known beforehand that"
15436,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"thou hadst so much strength in thee, and wouldst have brought me so"
15437,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],near to a great mishap I would not have suffered thee to enter this
15438,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],time. Know then that I have all along deceived thee by my illusions;
15439,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"first in the forest, where I tied up the wallet with iron wire so that"
15440,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],thou couldst not untie it. After this thou gavest me three blows with
15441,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"thy mallet; the first, though the least, would have ended my days"
15442,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"had it fallen on me, but I slipped aside and thy blows fell on the"
15443,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"mountain, where thou wilt find three glens, one of them remarkably"
15444,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],deep. These are the dints made by thy mallet. I have made use of
15445,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],similar illusions in the contests ye have had with my followers. In the
15446,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"first, Loki, like hunger itself, devoured all that was set before him,"
15447,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"but Logi was in reality nothing else than Fire, and therefore consumed"
15448,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"not only the meat but the trough which held it. Hugi, with whom Thialfi"
15449,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"contended in running, was Thought, and it was impossible for Thialfi"
15450,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"to keep pace with that. When thou, in thy turn, didst attempt to empty"
15451,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the horn, thou didst perform, by my troth, a deed so marvelous that had"
15452,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],I not seen it myself I should never have believed it. For one end of
15453,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"that horn reached the sea, which thou wast not aware of, but when thou"
15454,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],comest to the shore thou wilt perceive how much the sea has sunk by
15455,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],thy drafts. Thou didst perform a feat no less wonderful by lifting up
15456,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the cat, and to tell thee the truth, when we saw that one of his paws"
15457,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"was off the floor, we were all of us terror-stricken, for what thou"
15458,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],tookest for a cat was in reality the Midgard serpent that encompasseth
15459,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the earth, and he was so stretched by thee that he was barely long"
15460,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],enough to inclose it between his head and tail. Thy wrestling with
15461,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Elli was also a most astonishing feat, for there was never yet a man,"
15462,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"nor ever will be, whom Old Age, for such in fact was Elli, will not"
15463,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"sooner or later lay low. But now, as we are going to part, let me tell"
15464,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],thee that it will be better for both of us if thou never come near me
15465,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"again, for shouldst thou do so, I shall again defend myself by other"
15466,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"illusions, so that thou wilt only lose thy labor and get no fame from"
15467,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the contest with me."""

15469,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"On hearing these words Thor, in a rage, laid hold of his mallet and"
15470,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"would have launched it at him, but Utgard-Loki had disappeared, and"
15471,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"when Thor would have returned to the city to destroy it, he found"

15477,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],than Thor and never recovered it. It happened in this way: Freyr once
15478,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"mounted Odin's throne, from whence one can see over the whole universe,"
15479,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and looking round, saw far off in the giant's kingdom a beautiful maid,"
15480,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"at the sight of whom he was struck with sudden sadness, insomuch that"
15481,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],from that moment he could neither sleep nor drink nor speak. At last
15482,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Skirnir, his messenger, drew his secret from him, and undertook to"
15483,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"get him the maiden for his bride, if he would give him his sword as a"

15514,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and battle-axes, for do what they would, none of them could harm him."
15515,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And this became a favorite pastime with them, and was regarded as an"

15519,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"she saw the pretended woman, inquired of her if she knew what the gods"

15592,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Brushes across a tired traveler's face
15593,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Who shuffles through the deep dew-moisten'd dust
15594,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"On a May evening, in the darken'd lanes,"
15595,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by,"
15596,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"So Höder brush'd by Hermod's side, and said:"
15597,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Take Sleipnir, Hermod, and set forth with dawn"
15598,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"To Hela's kingdom, to ask Balder back;"
15599,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And they shall be thy guides who have the power."""
15600,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"He spake, and brush'd soft by and disappear'd."
15601,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And Hermod gazed into the night, and said:"
15602,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Who is it utters through the dark his hest"
15603,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"So quickly, and will wait for no reply?"
15604,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],The voice was like the unhappy Höder's voice.
15605,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Howbeit I will see, and do his hest;"
15606,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"For there rang note divine in that command."""
15607,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"So speaking, the fleet-footed Hermod came"
15608,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Home, and lay down to sleep in his own house;"
15609,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And all the gods lay down in their own homes.
15610,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And Höder, too, came home distraught with grief,"
15611,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Loathing to meet, at dawn, the other gods;"
15612,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And he went in, and shut the door, and fixt"
15613,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"His sword upright, and fell on it, and died."
15614,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose,"
15615,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"The throne, from which his eye surveys the world;"
15616,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And mounted Sleipnir, and in darkness rode"
15617,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"To Asgard. And the stars came out in heaven,"
15618,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"High over Asgard, to light home the king."
15619,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"But fiercely Odin gallop'd, moved in heart:"
15620,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And swift to Asgard, to the gate he came,"
15621,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And terribly the hoofs of Sleipnir rang
15622,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets,"
15623,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And the gods trembled on their golden beds
15624,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Hearing the wrathful father coming home--
15625,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"For dread, for like a whirlwind Odin came."
15626,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"And to Valhalla's gate he rode, and left"
15627,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Sleipnir; and Sleipnir went to his own stall,"
15628,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And in Valhalla Odin laid him down.
15629,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15630,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"That night in a vision appeared Balder to Nanna his wife, comforting"

15650,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Some solace in each other's look and speech,"
15651,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Wandering together through that gloomy world,"

15656,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Her arms towards him with a cry, but he"
15657,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Mournfully shook his head and disappear'd.

15659,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Hang in the air, afield, and disappear,"
15660,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],So Balder faded in the night away.
15661,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And Nanna on her bed sank back; but then
15662,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Frea, the mother of the gods, with stroke"
15663,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Painless and swift, set free her airy soul,"
15664,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Which took, on Balder's track, the way below;"
15665,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And instantly the sacred morn appear'd.
15666,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15667,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"With the morn Hermod, mounting Sleipnir, set out on his mission. For"
15668,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],the space of nine days and as many nights he rode through deep glens so
15669,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"dark that he could not discern anything, until he arrived at the river"
15670,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Gyoll, which he passed over on a bridge covered with glittering gold."
15671,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"The maiden who kept the bridge asked him his name and lineage, telling"
15672,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],him that the day before five bands of dead persons had ridden over the
15673,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"bridge, and did not shake it as much as he alone. ""But,"" she added,"
15674,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""thou hast not death's hue on thee; why then ridest thou here on the"

15676,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15677,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""I ride to Hel,"" answered Hermod, ""to seek Balder. Hast thou perchance"

15679,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15680,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"She replied, ""Balder hath ridden over Gyoll's bridge, and yonder lieth"

15682,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15683,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Hermod pursued his journey until he came to the barred gates of Hel.
15684,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Here he alighted, girthed his saddle tighter, and remounting clapped"
15685,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"both spurs to his horse, which cleared the gate by a tremendous leap"
15686,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"without touching it. Hermod then rode on to the palace, where he found"
15687,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"his brother Balder occupying the most distinguished seat in the hall,"
15688,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and passed the night in his company. The next morning he besought
15689,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Hela to let Balder ride home with him, assuring her that nothing but"
15690,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],lamentations were to be heard among the gods. Hela answered that it
15691,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],should now be tried whether Balder was so beloved as he was said to be.
15692,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""If, therefore,"" she added, ""all things in the world, both living and"

15695,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15696,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Hermod then rode back to Asgard and gave an account of all he had heard
15697,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and witnessed.
15698,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15699,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],The gods upon this dispatched messengers throughout the world to beg
15700,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],everything to weep in order that Balder might be delivered from Hel.
15701,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"All things very willingly complied with this request, both men and"
15702,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"every other living being, as well as earths, and stones, and trees,"
15703,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and metals, just as we have all seen these things weep when they are"
15704,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],brought from a cold place into a hot one.
15705,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15706,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Then the messengers returned,--"
15707,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15708,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"... And they rode home together, through the wood"
15709,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Of Jarnvid, which to east of Midgard lies"
15710,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Bordering the giants, where the trees are iron;"

15712,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Where sate in the cave's mouth a skinny hag,"
15713,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Toothless and old; she gibes the passers-by.
15714,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Thok is she called, but now Lok wore her shape;"
15715,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"She greeted them the first, and laughed and said:"
15716,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Ye gods, good lack, is it so dull in heaven"
15717,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],That ye come pleasuring to Thok's iron wood?
15718,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Lovers of change, ye are, fastidious sprites."
15719,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Look, as in some boor's yard, a sweet-breath'd cow,"
15720,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Whose manger is stuffed full of good fresh hay,"
15721,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Snuffs at it daintily, and stoops her head"
15722,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"To chew the straw, her litter at her feet--"
15723,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"So ye grow squeamish, gods, and sniff at heaven!"""
15724,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"She spake, but Hermod answered her and said,"
15725,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Thok, not for gibes we come; we come for tears."
15726,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Balder is dead, and Hela holds her prey,"
15727,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"But will restore, if all things give him tears."
15728,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Begrudge not thine! to all was Balder dear."""
15729,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Then, with a louder laugh, the hag replied:"
15730,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Is Balder dead? and do ye come for tears?"
15731,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Thok with dry eyes will weep o'er Balder's pyre.
15732,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Weep him all other things, if weep they will--"
15733,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"I weep him not! let Hela keep her prey."""
15734,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"She spake, and to the cavern's depth she fled,"
15735,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Mocking; and Hermod knew their toil was vain.[367]
15736,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15737,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],So was Balder prevented from returning to Asgard.
15738,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15739,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],=279. The Funeral of Balder.= The gods took up the dead body and bore
15740,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"it to the seashore, where stood Balder's ship Hringham, which passed"
15741,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],for the largest in the world. Balder's dead body was put on the funeral
15742,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"pile, on board the ship; and the body of Nanna was burned on the"
15743,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],same pile with her husband's. There was a vast concourse of various
15744,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],kinds of people at Balder's obsequies. First came Odin accompanied by
15745,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Frigga, the Valkyries, and his ravens; then Freyr in his car drawn by"
15746,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Gullinbursti, the boar; Heimdall rode his horse Gulltopp, and Freya"
15747,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],drove in her chariot drawn by cats. There were also a great many Frost
15748,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],giants and giants of the mountain present. Balder's horse was led to
15749,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the pile fully caparisoned, and was consumed in the same flames with"
15750,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],his master.

15755,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15756,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],But Loki did not escape his merited punishment. When he saw how wroth
15757,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the gods were, he fled to the mountain and there built himself a hut"
15758,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"with four doors, so that he could see every approaching danger. He"
15759,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"invented a net to catch the fishes, such as fishermen have used since"
15760,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],his time. But Odin found out his hiding place and the gods assembled to
15761,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"take him. He, seeing this, changed himself into a salmon and lay hid"
15762,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],among the stones of the brook. But the gods took his net and dragged
15763,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the brook, and Loki, finding he must be caught, tried to leap over the"
15764,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"net; but Thor caught him by the tail, and compressed it so that salmon"
15765,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],ever since have had that part remarkably fine and thin. They bound him
15766,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"with chains and suspended a serpent over his head, whose venom falls"
15767,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"upon his face drop by drop. His wife, Siguna, sits by his side and"
15768,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"catches the drops as they fall, in a cup; but when she carries it away"
15769,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"to empty it, the venom falls upon Loki, which makes him howl with"
15770,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],horror and writhe so that the whole earth shakes.

15773,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"to the gods, but still possessed of great power; these were the"
15774,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Elves. The white spirits, or Elves of Light, were exceedingly fair,"
15775,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"more brilliant than the sun, and clad in garments of a delicate and"
15776,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"transparent texture. They loved the light, were kindly disposed to"
15777,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"mankind, and generally appeared as fair and lovely children. Their"
15778,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"country was called Elfheim, and was the domain of Freyr, in whose"
15779,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],sunlight they always sported.
15780,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15781,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"The black elves, ugly, long-nosed dwarfs, of a dirty brown color,"
15782,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],appeared only at night. They avoided the sun as their most deadly
15783,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"enemy, because his beams changed them immediately into stones."
15784,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Their language was the echo of solitudes, and their dwelling places"
15785,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],subterranean caves and clefts. They were supposed to have come into
15786,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],existence as maggots produced by the decaying flesh of Ymir's body.
15787,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],They were afterwards endowed by the gods with a human form and great
15788,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],understanding. They were particularly distinguished for a knowledge of
15789,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the mysterious powers of nature, and for the runes which they carved"
15790,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],and explained. They were the most skillful artificers of all created
15791,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"beings, and worked in metals and in wood. Among their most noted works"
15792,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"were Thor's hammer, and the ship _Skidbladnir_, which they gave to"
15793,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Freyr. This vessel was so large that it could contain all the deities
15794,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"with their war and household implements, but so skillfully was it"
15795,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],wrought that when folded together it could be put into a side pocket.
15796,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15797,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],=281. Ragnarok.= It was a firm belief of the Northern nations that a
15798,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"time would come when all the visible creation, the gods of Valhalla"
15799,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and Niflheim, the inhabitants of Jötunheim, Elfheim, and Midgard,"
15800,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"together with their habitations, would be destroyed. The fearful day"
15801,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],of destruction will not however be without warning. First will come
15802,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"a triple winter, during which snow will fall from the four corners"
15803,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"of the heavens, the frost be severe, the wind piercing, the weather"
15804,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"tempestuous, and the sun impart no gladness. Three such winters will"
15805,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],pass without being tempered by a single summer. Three other like
15806,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"winters will follow, during which war and discord will spread over the"
15807,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"universe. The earth itself will be afraid and begin to tremble, the"
15808,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"sea leave its basin, the heavens tear asunder; men will perish in great"
15809,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"numbers, and the eagles of the air feast upon their still quivering"
15810,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"bodies. The wolf Fenris will now break his bands, the Midgard serpent"
15811,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"rise out of his bed in the sea, and Loki, released from his bonds, will"
15812,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],join the enemies of the gods. Amidst the general devastation the sons
15813,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"of Muspelheim will rush forth under their leader Surter, before and"
15814,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"behind whom are flames and burning fire. Onward they ride over Bifrost,"
15815,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"the rainbow bridge, which breaks under the horses' hoofs. But they,"
15816,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"disregarding its fall, direct their course to the battle field called"
15817,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Vigrid. Thither also repair the wolf Fenris, the Midgard serpent, Loki,"
15818,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"with all the followers of Hela, and the Frost giants."
15819,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15820,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Heimdall now stands up and sounds the Giallar horn to assemble the gods
15821,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"and heroes for the contest. The gods advance, led on by Odin, who,"
15822,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"engaging the wolf Fenris, falls a victim to the monster. Fenris is, in"
15823,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"turn, slain by Vidar, Odin's son. Thor wins great renown by killing"

15828,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"over the world, and the universe is consumed. The sun grows dim, the"

15838,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],This twilight of the gods is aptly described in a conversation held

15840,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],
15841,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply:[368]--
15842,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"""Thou hast then all the solace death allows,"

15872,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Longing will stir within my breast, though vain."
15873,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"But not to me so grievous as, I know,"
15874,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"To other gods it were, is my enforced"
15875,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],Absence from fields where I could nothing aid;
15876,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],For I am long since weary of your storm

15889,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],"Tell me, that I may ponder it when gone."""
15890,MYTHS OF THE NORSE GODS[364],And the ray-crownèd Balder answered him:--

15946,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"also, the son of Sigi, was a man of valor and one who got lordship and"

15948,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"_Volsung_, who ruled over Hunland after his father Rerir went home to"
15949,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Odin.
15950,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,

15956,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
15957,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Now on the night of the wedding great fires were made in the hall of
15958,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the Volsungs, and in the midst stood Branstock, a great oak tree, about"
15959,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"which the hall had been built, and the limbs of the tree spread over"
15960,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the roof of the hall; and round about Branstock they sat and feasted,"
15961,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,and sang of ancient heroes and heard the music of the harp that went
15962,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,from hand to hand.
15963,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
15964,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,But e'en as men's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder

15966,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,O'er the cloudless noontide heaven; and some men turned about
15967,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out.
15968,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode,"
15969,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"One-eyed and seeming ancient, yet bright his visage glowed;"
15970,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Cloud-blue was the hood upon him, and his kirtle gleaming-gray"

15977,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"So strode he to the Branstock, nor greeted any lord,"
15978,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword,"
15979,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"And smote it deep in the tree-bole, and the wild hawks overhead"
15980,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said:
15981,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"""Earls of the Goths, and Volsungs, abiders on the earth,"

16000,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;"
16001,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,"
16002,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to"

16004,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16005,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Then all made trial, Siggeir and his earls, and Volsung and his people,"
16006,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"to draw forth the sword from Branstock, but with no success, till"
16007,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Sigmund, laying his hand carelessly on the precious hilt, drew forth"
16008,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,the naked blade as though it were loose in the oak. Whereupon Siggeir
16009,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"offered money for the sword, but Sigmund scorned the offer."
16010,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16011,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,But in time Siggeir had his vengeance. Inviting King Volsung and his
16012,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"sons to Gothland, he fell upon them, slew the king, and suffered"
16013,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the sons, fastened under a log, to be devoured in succession by a"
16014,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"she-wolf--all but Sigmund, who through the wile of his sister Signy was"
16015,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"rescued. He, driven to the life of an outlaw, sought means to avenge"
16016,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"his father, and Signy, on her part, strove to aid him,--without avail,"
16017,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"however, till Sinfiotli, the son of herself and Sigmund, was grown"
16018,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"to manhood. This youth bore Sigmund company. For a season, as wolves,"
16019,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"they scoured the woods; finally resuming the form of men, they slew the"
16020,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"children of Siggeir and burned him in his hall. Signy, having helped to"
16021,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"avenge her father, died with her husband."
16022,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16023,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Sigmund, thereupon, became king, and took to himself a wife. But she,"
16024,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"suffering injury at the hands of Sinfiotli, poisoned him with a horn of"
16025,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"ale. Then Sigmund sorrowed nigh to death over his son, and drove away"
16026,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"that queen, and soon after she died. He then married Hiordis the fair;"
16027,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"but before long, doing battle against Lyngi, the son of Hunding,--a"
16028,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"chieftain who also had loved the fair Hiordis,--he got his death wound:"
16029,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16030,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"For lo, through the hedge of the war-shafts a mighty man there came,"
16031,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"One-eyed and seeming ancient, but his visage shone like flame;"
16032,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Gleaming-gray was his kirtle, and his hood was cloudy-blue;"
16033,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"And he bore a mighty twibil, as he waded the fight-sheaves through,"
16034,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"And stood face to face with Sigmund, and upheaved the bill to smite."
16035,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Once more round the head of the Volsung fierce glittered the
16036,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Branstock's light,"
16037,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,The sword that came from Odin; and Sigmund's cry once more
16038,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Rang out to the very heavens above the din of war.
16039,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Then clashed the meeting edges with Sigmund's latest stroke,"
16040,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,And in shivering shards fell earthward that fear of worldly folk.
16041,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"But changed were the eyes of Sigmund, and the war-wrath left his face;"
16042,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"For that gray-clad mighty helper was gone, and in his place"
16043,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Drave on the unbroken spear-wood 'gainst the Volsung's empty hands:
16044,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"And there they smote down Sigmund, the wonder of all lands,"
16045,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"On the foemen, on the death-heap his deeds had piled that day."
16046,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16047,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"To Hiordis, after Sigmund's death, was born _Sigurd_, like whom was"
16048,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,never man for comeliness and valor and great-heartedness and might.
16049,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"He was the greatest of the Volsungs. His foster-father was Regin, the"
16050,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"son of Rodmar, a blacksmith, who taught him the lore of runes and many"
16051,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"tongues; and, by means of a story of ancient wrongs, incited him to the"
16052,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"destruction of the dragon Fafnir. For Regin told that while the gods,"
16053,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Odin and H[oe]nir, were wandering with Loki near Rodmar's house, Loki"
16054,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"slew one of Rodmar's sons, Otter. Whereupon Rodmar demanded that the"
16055,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,gods should fill the Otter-skin with gold and cover it with gold. Now
16056,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Loki, being sent to procure the gold, caught Andvari the dwarf, and"
16057,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,from him procured by force a hoard of the precious metal and with it
16058,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"a magic ring, whose touch bred gold. But Andvari cursed the ring and"
16059,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,the gold and all that might possess either. The gods forthwith filled
16060,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Otter with the dwarf's gold, and surrendered both gold and ring to"
16061,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Rodmar. Immediately the curse began to work. Fafnir, brother of Regin"
16062,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"and Otter, slew Rodmar and seized the treasure and, assuming a dragon's"
16063,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"form, brooded upon the hoard. With this tale Regin egged on Sigurd to"
16064,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the undoing of Fafnir. He welded him, too, a resistless sword out of"
16065,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the shards of Sigmund's sword, Gram (the wrath). Then Sigurd swore that"
16066,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"he would slay the dragon. But first, riding on his horse, Greyfell, of"
16067,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the blood of Odin's Sleipnir, he avenged upon the sons of Hunding the"
16068,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"death of his father. This done, Sigurd rode to Glistenheath and slew"
16069,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Fafnir, the dragon, and eating of his heart, learned the language of"
16070,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the birds; and at their advice he slew Regin also, who plotted against"
16071,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,him.
16072,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16073,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"So, setting the ring of Andvari on his finger and bearing the gold"
16074,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"before him on his horse, Greyfell, Sigurd comes to the Hill of Hindfell:"
16075,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,

16132,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,of old when she espoused the cause in battle of those whom the Norns

16134,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"her had Sigurd awakened; and she loved him, for he was without fear and"

16136,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"one to the other, both then and again; and Sigurd gave her the ring of"
16137,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Andvari. But they were not destined to dwell together in wedlock, and"
16138,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Brynhild, foreseeing the future, knew even this."
16139,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,

16143,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,which a fair hawk feathered with feathers of gold alighted upon her
16144,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"wrist. She went to Brynhild for the interpretation of the dream. ""The"
16145,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"hawk,"" said Brynhild, ""is Sigurd."" And so it came to pass. Sigurd,"
16146,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"visiting the court of the Nibelungs, was kindly entreated by King Giuki"
16147,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"and his three sons, Gunnar, Hogni, and Guttorm; and he performed deeds"
16148,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"of valor such that they honored him. But after many days, Grimhild, the"
16149,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"mother of Gudrun, administered to Sigurd a magic potion that removed"
16150,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,from him all memory of Brynhild. So Sigurd loved and wedded the fair
16151,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Gudrun. Indeed he soon joined others in urging his wife's brother
16152,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Gunnar, a doughty warrior, to sue for the hand of Brynhild herself. But"
16153,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Brynhild would have no one that could not ride through the flames drawn
16154,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"up around her hall. After Gunnar had made two unsuccessful attempts,"
16155,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Sigurd, assuming the form of King Gunnar, mounted Greyfell and rode for"
16156,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the second time through the flames of Hindfell. Then, still wearing"
16157,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the semblance of Gunnar, he gained the consent of Brynhild to the"
16158,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"union, and exchanged rings with her,--she giving him none other than"
16159,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,the ancient ring of Andvari back again. But even this did not recall
16160,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,to Sigurd's memory his former ride and his former love. Returning to
16161,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the land of the Nibelungs, he announced the success of his undertaking"
16162,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"and told all things to Gudrun, giving her the fatal ring that he had"
16163,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,regained from Brynhild.
16164,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16165,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"In ten days came Brynhild by agreement to the Hall of the Nibelungs,"
16166,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"and though she knew well the deceit that had been practiced on her,"
16167,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"she made no sign; nay, was wedded, according to her promise, to King"
16168,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Gunnar. But as they sat at the wedding-feast, the charm of Grimhild was"
16169,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"outworn,--Sigurd looked upon Gunnar's bride and knew the Brynhild of"
16170,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"old, the Valkyrie, whom he had loved; ""and Brynhild's face drew near"
16171,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"him with eyes grown stern and strange."""
16172,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16173,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"But, apparently, all went well till the young queens, one day bathing"
16174,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"in the Water of the Nibelungs, fell into contention on a matter of"
16175,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,privilege. Brynhild claimed precedence in entering the river on the
16176,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"ground that Gunnar was the liege lord of Sigurd. Gudrun, white with"
16177,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"wrath, flashed out the true story of the ride through the flames, and"
16178,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"thrust in Brynhild's face the Andvari ring. Consumed with jealousy,"
16179,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Brynhild plotted revenge. She loved Sigurd still, and he, since he"
16180,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"had regained his memory, could not overcome his love for her. But the"
16181,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"insult from Gudrun Brynhild would not brook. By her machinations,"
16182,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Guttorm, the brother of Gudrun, was incited to slay Sigurd. He,"
16183,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"accordingly, stabbed the hero while asleep, but Sigurd, throwing Gram"

16191,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,And spake words of loving-kindness as he strove for life and breath;

16193,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"In remembrance of our glory, mid the gifts the gods shall give!..."

16219,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16220,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Finally Gudrun sent her sons by Jonakr to avenge their half-sister's

16238,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"story--called the Nibelungenlied--certain variations of name, incident,"
16239,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"and character appear. Sigurd is Siegfried, dwelling in Xanten near"
16240,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the Rhine, the son of Siegmund and Siegelind, king and queen of the"
16241,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Netherlands. Gudrun is Kriemhild, sister of Gunther (Gunnar), king"
16242,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"of the Burgundians, and niece of Hagen (Hogni), a warrior of dark"
16243,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"and sullen mien, cunning, but withal loyal and brave, the foe of"
16244,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the glorious Siegfried. Siegfried weds Kriemhild, takes her to the"
16245,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Netherlands and lives happily with her, enjoying the moneys of the"
16246,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Nibelungen hoard, which he had taken not from a dwarf, as in the Norse"
16247,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"version, but from two princes, the sons of King Nibelung. Meanwhile"
16248,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Gunther dwells in peace in the Burgundian land, husband of the proud"
16249,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Brunhild, whom Siegfried had won for him by stratagem not altogether"
16250,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,unlike that of the Norse story. For the Brunhild of the Yssel-land had
16251,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,declared that she would marry no man save him who should surpass her
16252,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"in athletic contest. This condition Siegfried, wearing the Tarnkappe,"
16253,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"a cloak that rendered him invisible, had fulfilled for Gunther. He had"
16254,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,also succored poor Gunther after his marriage with Brunhild. For that
16255,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"heroine, in contempt of Gunther's strength, had bound him hand and"
16256,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,foot and suspended him from a nail on their bedroom wall. By agreement
16257,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Siegfried had again assumed Gunther's form and, after a fearful tussle"
16258,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"with the queen, had reduced her to submission, taking from her the"
16259,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"ring and girdle which were the secret sources of her strength, and"
16260,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"leaving her to imagine that she had been conquered by her bridegroom,"
16261,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Gunther. The ring and girdle Siegfried had bestowed upon Kriemhild,"
16262,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,unwisely telling her at the same time the story of Brunhild's defeat.
16263,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Although the Nibelungenlied offers no explanation, it is evident that"
16264,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,the injured queen of Yssel-land had recognized Siegfried during this
16265,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,ungallant intrigue; and we are led to infer that there had been some
16266,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,previous acquaintance and passage of love between them.

16321,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16322,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"So began the altercation. It attained its climax the same day, when"
16323,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,each queen attempted to take precedence of the other in entering the
16324,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,cathedral for the celebration of the mass.
16325,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16326,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Both met before the minster in all the people's sight;
16327,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,There at once the hostess let out her deadly spite.

16329,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"""No vassaless precedeth the lady of the land."""
16330,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16331,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Then, full of wrath, Kriemhild, in terms anything but delicate,"
16332,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,acquainted her haughty sister-in-law with the deception that had
16333,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"twice been practiced upon her by Siegfried and Gunther; nay, worse,"
16334,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,corroborated her statement by displaying both ring and girdle that
16335,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Brunhild had lost. The altercation came to the ears of the kings.
16336,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Gunther made complaint to Siegfried. Then,"
16337,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16338,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"... ""Women must be instructed,"" said Siegfried, the good knight,"
16339,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"""To leave off idle talking and rule their tongues aright."

16342,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16343,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,But it was too late to mend the matter. With devilish intent Brunhild
16344,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"plotted vengeance. Siegfried, the author of her mortification, must"
16345,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"die the death. The foes of Siegfried persuaded his wife, unaware of"
16346,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"their design, to embroider in his vesture a silken cross over the one"
16347,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"spot where the hero was vulnerable. Then the crafty Hagen, who had been"
16348,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"suborned by Brunhild to the baleful deed, bided his time. One day,"
16349,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Gunther, Hagen, and Siegfried, heated in running, stayed by a brook to"
16350,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,drink. Hagen saw his chance.
16351,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16352,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"... Then, as to drink, Sir Siegfried down kneeling there he found,"
16353,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"He pierced him through the crosslet, that sudden from the wound"

16360,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,At last prone in the meadow lay mighty Siegfried dead.
16361,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,
16362,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Brunhild glories in the fall of Siegfried and exults over the mourning
16363,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"widow. Kriemhild, sitting apart, nurses schemes of vengeance. Her"
16364,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,brothers affect to patch up the breach in order that they may obtain
16365,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the hoard of the Nibelungs. But this treasure, after it has been"
16366,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"brought to Worms, is sunk, for precaution's sake, by Hagen, in the"
16367,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,Rhine. Although in time Kriemhild becomes the wife of King Etzel
16368,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"(Atli, Attila) of Hunland, still she does not forget the injury done"
16369,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,her by her kin. After thirteen years she inveigles her brothers and
16370,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"their retainers, called now Nibelungs because of their possession of"
16371,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"the hoard, to Etzel's court, where, after a desperate and dastardly"
16372,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"encounter, in which their hall is reduced to ashes, they are all"
16373,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"destroyed save Gunther and Hagen. Immediately, thereafter, Gunther's"
16374,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"head is cut off at her orders; and she herself, with Siegfried's sword"
16375,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"Balmung, severs the head of the hated Hagen from his body. With these"
16376,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"warriors the secret of the hidden hoard passes. Kriemhild, having"
16377,MYTHS OF NORSE AND OLD GERMAN HEROES,"wreaked her vengeance, falls by the hand of one of her husband's"

16410,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,=284. Wagner's Tetralogy.= In his famous Ring of the Nibelung the
16411,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"German composer, Richard Wagner, returns to the Norse version of the"
16412,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,stories recounted in the chapter preceding this. He is responsible
16413,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,not only for the musical score of the four operas of which the Ring
16414,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"consists, but for the text and scenic arrangement as well. As musical"
16415,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,dramas the four plays constitute the grandest series of the kind that
16416,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the world possesses. But even if they were not wedded to such music,"
16417,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the _Rhine-gold_, the _Valkyrie_, the _Siegfried_, and the _Twilight_"
16418,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"(or _Dusk_) _of the Gods_ would be entitled, for creative invention,"
16419,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"imaginative insight and power, and poetic diction, to rank with notable"
16420,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"dramas, ancient or modern. The tetralogy (or series of four) presents"
16421,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the whole story of the accursed Nibelung gold, from that dawn when it"
16422,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,was wrested from the daughters of the Rhine to that dusk when it was
16423,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"restored, having wrought meanwhile the doom of Nibelungs, Volsungs, and"
16424,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the gods themselves.
16425,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16426,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,=285. The Rhine-gold.= We are at the bottom of the Rhine: a greenish
16427,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"twilight, and moving water, and everywhere sharp points of rocks"
16428,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,jutting from the depths. Around the central rock three Rhine-daughters
16429,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"swim, guarding it carefully, but laughing and playing, and chasing one"
16430,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the other as they guard. To them from a chasm climbs Alberich, the"
16431,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Nibelung, he who in the old Norse lay was known as Andvari. He views"
16432,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the maidens with increasing pleasure. He addresses them, he clambers"
16433,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"after them, he strives to catch them; they lure him on, they mock him"
16434,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and escape his grasp; he woos them each in turn, all unsuccessfully. He"
16435,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"gazes upward--""Could I but catch one""; then once more failing, remains"
16436,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,in speechless rage. Rage soon transformed to wonder: for through the
16437,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"water from above there filters a brightening glow, a magical light,"
16438,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,streaming from the summit of the central rock where in the splendor of
16439,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the morning sun the Rhine-gold laughs a-kindle.
16440,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16441,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""What is it, ye sleek ones,"

16468,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"So, lightly sing the Rhine-daughters; but Alberich, with his eyes on"
16469,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the gold, has heeded well their chatter. ""The world's wealth,"" he"
16470,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"mutters; ""might I win that by the spell of the gold? Nay, though love"
16471,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"be the forfeit, my cunning shall win me delight."" Then terribly loud he"

16488,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16489,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The scene changes. An open space on a mountain height becomes visible.
16490,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"The dawning day lights up a castle, glittering with pinnacles, on"
16491,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the top of a cliff. Below flows silent the Rhine. At one side, on a"
16492,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"flowery bank, Wotan (Odin), king of the gods, lies sleeping, and Fricka"
16493,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"(Frigga) his wife. They wake. Wotan turns toward his castle, new-built"
16494,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"by the giants, and exults; but Fricka reminds him of the terrible price"
16495,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"that is yet to be paid for its building,--none other, forsooth, than"
16496,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the person of Freia, the fair one, the goddess of spring and love, she"
16497,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"who tends the garden of the gods, and whose apples, eaten from day to"
16498,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"day, confer eternal youth,--she is the wage that the giants will claim."
16499,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16500,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""I mind me well of the bargain,"" returns Wotan, ""but I give no thought"
16501,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"to fulfill it. My castle stands; for the wage--fret not thyself."""
16502,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16503,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Oh, laughing, impious lightness,"" reproves him Fricka, ""thy bargain is"
16504,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"fast, and is still to rue."""
16505,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16506,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Nay, on the moment rushes Freia to them, pleading, pursued by the"
16507,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"giants. ""Give her to us!"" they cry,--Fasolt and Fafner, mighty twain"
16508,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"that unslumbering had reared the walls of Wotan's castle, to win them a"
16509,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"woman, winsome and sweet."
16510,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16511,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Now pay us our wage!"""
16512,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16513,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Nay,"" coolly answers Wotan, ""other guerdon ask. Freia may I not grant!"""
16514,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16515,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,But the giants insist. They accuse the god of faithlessness. He jests
16516,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"with them, temporizing, awaiting anxiously the arrival of Loge (Loki),"
16517,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"spirit of cunning, at whose suggestion that bargain had been struck."
16518,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,For even then Loge had secretly assured Wotan that Freia should in the
16519,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"emergency be ransomed. The giants, indignant at the delay, press on"
16520,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Freia. She calls on her brothers, Froh (Freyr) and Donner (Thor). They"
16521,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,rush to her rescue: Froh clasps the fair one; Donner plants himself
16522,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,before the importunates.
16523,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16524,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Know ye the weight of my hammer's blow?"" thunders he."
16525,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16526,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,There is battle in the air.
16527,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16528,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Then enters Loge, demon of fire, mischief-maker, traitor, and thief,"
16529,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,whom long ago Wotan had lifted from his evil brood and of him made a
16530,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,friend and counselor.
16531,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16532,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Now hear, crabbèd one; keep thy word,"" says Wotan, sharply."
16533,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16534,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Loge appears to be nonplussed. He has restlessly searched to the ends
16535,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"of the world to find a ransom for Freia; ""but naught is so rich that"
16536,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"giant or man will take it as price for a woman's worth and delight."" He"
16537,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"has sought amid the forces of water and earth and air; ""but naught is"
16538,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,so mighty that giant or man will prefer it above a woman's worth and
16539,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"delight!"" And yet,--slyly Loge lets fall the word,--there is the ruddy"
16540,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Gold:
16541,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16542,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Yea, one I looked on, but _one_, who love's delights forswore, for"

16544,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16545,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,And he recounts the marvels of the Rhine-gold. The giants offer to take
16546,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"it in lieu of Freia; nay, gods and goddesses as well are held by the"
16547,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"charm of the glittering hoard; by the lure, and the dread too, of the"
16548,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Ring that, once fashioned, gives measureless might to its lord. Even"
16549,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"now, doubtless, he who has forsworn love has muttered the magic rune"
16550,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and rounded the sovereign circlet of gold. If so, the gods themselves"
16551,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"shall be his slaves,--slaves of the Nibelung Alberich."
16552,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16553,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""The ring I must win me,"" decides Wotan."
16554,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16555,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""But at the cost of love?"" queries Froh."
16556,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16557,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Loge counsels the theft of the gold from Alberich and its restoration
16558,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"to the daughters of the Rhine. But the gods are not thus far-sighted,"
16559,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and the giants insist upon the hoard as their due. They seize Freia,"
16560,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,and bear her away as pledge till that ransom be paid....
16561,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16562,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Alack, what aileth the gods?"""
16563,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16564,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"It is Loge who speaks. A pale mist falls upon the scene, gradually"
16565,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,growing denser. The light of the heavenly abodes is quenched. Wotan
16566,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,and all his clan become increasingly wan and aged. Freia of the Garden
16567,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"is departed: the apples of youth are decaying; ""old and gray, worn and"

16572,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16573,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"The scene changes to Nibelheim, the subterranean home of the Nibelungs."
16574,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Wotan and Loge find Mime, Alberich's brother, bewailing the fate of"
16575,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the Nibelungs--for Alberich has fashioned the Ring and all below groan
16576,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"under his tyranny. Even now, reluctantly indeed, Mime is forging the"
16577,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"_Tarnhelm_ for his tyrant brother,--a wishing-cap by whose magic the"
16578,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,wearer may transfer himself through space and assume whatever form he
16579,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"please, or make himself invisible, at will. Alberich, in the flush"
16580,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"of power, enters, driving before him with brandished whip a host"
16581,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,of Nibelungs from the caverns. They are laden with gold and silver
16582,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,handiwork. At Alberich's command they heap it in a pile. He draws the
16583,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Ring from his finger; the vanquished host trembles and, shrieking,"
16584,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,cowers away.
16585,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16586,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""What seek ye here?"" demands he, looking long and suspiciously at Wotan"
16587,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,and Loge.
16588,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16589,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"They have heard strange tidings, says Wotan, and they come to see the"

16591,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"exhibit the virtues of the Tarnhelm. Readily beguiled, he displays his"
16592,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,necromantic power. First he transforms himself into a loathly dragon.
16593,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The gods pretend dismay:--he can make himself great; can he make
16594,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"himself small, likewise? ""Pah, nothing simpler! Look at me now!"" He"
16595,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"dons the Tarnhelm, and lo, a toad!"
16596,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16597,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""There, grasp quickly,"" says Loge. Wotan places his foot on the toad,"
16598,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and Loge seizes the Tarnhelm. Alberich becomes visible in his own form,"
16599,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,writhing under Wotan's foot. The gods bind him and drag him to the
16600,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,chasm by which they had descended.
16601,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16602,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"The scene changes to the open space before Valhalla. Alberich, dragged"
16603,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"in by Loge, is forced to deliver up the hoard and the Tarnhelm and the"
16604,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Ring. Wotan contemplates the Ring and puts it on. Alberich is set at
16605,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,liberty.
16606,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16607,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Am I now free?"" cries he, ""free in sooth? Thus greets you then my"
16608,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"freedom's foremost word: As by curse it came to me, accursed forever be"
16609,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"this Ring! As its gold gave measureless might, let now its magic deal"
16610,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,death to its lord. Its wealth shall yield pleasure to none. Care shall
16611,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,consume him who doth hold it. All shall lust after its delights; yet
16612,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,naught shall it boot him who wins the prize! To its lord no gain let
16613,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"it bring; and forever be murder drawn in its wake, till again once more"
16614,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"in my hand, rewon, I hold it!"""
16615,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16616,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"So the baffled Nibelung curses, and departs. Then enter Fricka, Donner,"
16617,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and Froh, followed soon by the giants, who bring Freia back. They"
16618,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"refuse, Fasolt and Fafner, to release the fair goddess until she is"
16619,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"fully redeemed; and they claim not only Tarnhelm and gold, but Ring as"
16620,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,well. With the Ring Wotan refuses to part. In that moment rises from
16621,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"a rocky cleft the goddess of the earth, Erda, the beloved of heaven's"
16622,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"god, and mother by him of the Valkyries."
16623,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16624,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Yield it, Wotan, yield it,"" she cries warningly. ""Flee the Ring's"
16625,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"dread curse."""
16626,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16627,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""What woman warneth me thus?"""
16628,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16629,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""All that e'er was, know I,"" pronounces Erda:"

16634,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"All that e'er was, endeth:"
16635,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,A darksome day
16636,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Dawns for your godhood!
16637,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Be counseled; give up the Ring."""
16638,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16639,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"She vanishes, the all-wise one; and Wotan surrenders the Ring. Freia"
16640,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"is redeemed, and the gods glow again with youth. No sooner have the"
16641,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,giants gained possession of the Ring than they proceed to quarrel over
16642,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,it. Fafner strikes out with his staff and stretches Fasolt on the
16643,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"ground. From the dying man he hastily wrests the Ring, puts it into his"
16644,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"sack, and goes on quietly packing the gold. In a solemn silence the"
16645,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,gods stand horrified. Care and fear fetter the soul of Wotan. That he
16646,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,may shake himself free of them he determines to descend to Erda; she
16647,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"yet can give him counsel. But first,--for Donner has cleared with his"
16648,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"thunder and lightning the clouds that had overspread the scene,--he"
16649,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"will enter ""Valhalla,"" his castle, golden-gleaming in the evening"
16650,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,sunlight.
16651,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16652,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""What meaneth the name, then?"" asks Fricka, as they cross the rainbow"
16653,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,bridge.
16654,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16655,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Wotan evades the question, for he still dreads the curse pronounced"
16656,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"by the Nibelung upon all who have owned the Ring; and that name,"
16657,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Valhalla,"" indicates just the means by which he hopes to escape the"
16658,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,curse. He has thought to avert the doom of the gods by gathering in
16659,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"this Valhalla, or Hall of the Slain, the spirits of heroes fallen in"
16660,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"battle--especially of heroes of a race that shall spring from himself,"
16661,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the Volsungs (or Wälsungs) yet to be born. They shall do battle for the
16662,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,gods when sounds the crack of doom. But of all this Wotan says naught.
16663,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,He will say in the hour of his triumph.
16664,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16665,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,As the gods enter Valhalla the plaints of the Rhine-maidens for the
16666,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,loss of their gold arise from the river below.
16667,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16668,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,=286.= In =The Valkyrie= Wotan proceeds with his plan. During his
16669,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"wanderings on earth, under the name of Wälse, he has become the father"
16670,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"of twin children, Siegmund and Sieglinde. These have, in early youth,"
16671,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"been separated by the murderous turmoil of warring clans, but now they"
16672,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"are to be reunited; and Wotan, with a primitive disregard of the fact"
16673,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"that they are brother and sister, intends to make them man and wife,"
16674,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"in order that from them may issue the heroic race that, in the latter"
16675,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"days, shall defend Valhalla from the onslaught of the powers of evil."
16676,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16677,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The play opens with the interior of a woodland lodge. In the center
16678,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"rises the stem of a mighty ash tree, about which has been built an"
16679,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,apartment of roughly hewn logs. It is toward evening and a violent
16680,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"thunderstorm is just subsiding. This is the home of Hunding, chieftain"
16681,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"of the Neiding clan. The door opens, and Siegmund, flying from his"
16682,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"enemies, wounded and weaponless, enters. Seeing no one, he closes the"
16683,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"door, strides toward the fire, and throws himself wearily down on a"
16684,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,bearskin:
16685,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16686,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Whoe'er own this hearth,"
16687,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Here must I rest me."""
16688,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16689,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,He remains stretched out motionless. A woman enters from an inner
16690,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,chamber. It is Sieglinde. She takes compassion on the helpless
16691,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"fugitive, admires his noble bearing, gives him drink, and bids him"
16692,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,tarry till her husband be home. They gaze upon each other with
16693,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,ever-increasing interest and emotion. Suddenly Siegmund starts up as if
16694,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,to go.
16695,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16696,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Who pursues thee?"" she inquires."
16697,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16698,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Ill fate pursues where'er I go. To thee, wife, may it never come."
16699,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Forth from thy house I fly."""
16700,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16701,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"She calls him back. ""Then bide thou here. Thou canst not bring ill fate"
16702,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"where ill fate already makes its home."""
16703,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16704,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,He leans against the hearth. Again the eyes of the twain meet.
16705,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16706,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Hunding enters, regards the stranger with suspicion, notes the"
16707,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,resemblance between him and Sieglinde; but he consents to harbor him
16708,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,for the night.
16709,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16710,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Thy name and fortune?"""
16711,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16712,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Wehwalt,"" says Siegmund, ""for woe still waits on my steps; Wehwalt,"
16713,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the son of Wolfe."" And thus concealing his race, he tells a story in"
16714,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,other respects true: how in his childhood a cruel host had laid waste
16715,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,his home and killed his mother and carried away the sister who was his
16716,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"twin, and how he and his father, the Wolf, for years had battled in the"
16717,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,woodlands against the Neidings.
16718,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16719,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The Neidings! They are Hunding's clan.
16720,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16721,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""My house holds thee, Wölfing, to-night. To-morrow defend thee; with"
16722,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"death thou shalt pay for this life!"" And Hunding withdraws, Sieglinde"
16723,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,with him.
16724,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16725,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Siegmund is weaponless. The firelight sends a sudden glow upon the
16726,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"ash tree, and a sword-hilt there sends back an answering gleam. But"
16727,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegmund knows not what it means. Clad in white, Sieglinde steals from"
16728,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the inner room. She has left Hunding asleep, overcome by a slumberous"
16729,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,draft.
16730,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16731,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Thy coming is life,"" cries Siegmund."
16732,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16733,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""A weapon, now, let me show thee,"" she replies. And she tells how, on"
16734,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the day of her unhappy wedding, a stranger, all in gray, low-hatted and"
16735,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"one-eyed, had entered the Hunding hall and struck into the ash stem a"
16736,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"sword that none but the bravest of heroes could win, and how all in"
16737,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,turn had tried in vain to draw forth the sword. Now she knows for whom
16738,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"it was ordained,--"
16739,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16740,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""It was for thee, my deliverer, my hero held in my arms!"""
16741,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16742,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,They embrace. He declares his lineage. He is son of him whose eye
16743,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"proudly glistened from under the low-brimmed hat,--son of Wälse,"
16744,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the wanderer. He is Siegmund, the Victorious. For him, the sword"
16745,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Nothung.--And he draws it easily forth.
16746,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16747,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Art thou Siegmund?"" she cries; ""Sieglinde am I. Thine own twin sister"
16748,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"thou winnest at once with the sword."""
16749,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16750,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Bride and sister be to thy brother; then nourish the Wälsungs for aye!"""
16751,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16752,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,So the twain make their compact.
16753,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16754,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,In the second act we are transported to a wild and rocky place. Before
16755,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Wotan, fully armed and carrying his spear, stands Brünnhilde, the"
16756,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"warrior maid, likewise fully armed. She is one of the nine Valkyries,"
16757,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"daughters of Wotan and Erda, fostered for battle that they might"
16758,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"forfend the doom foretold by Erda herself,--the shameful defeat of the"
16759,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"gods. Well have the Valkyrs, choosers of the slain, performed their"
16760,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"task, stirring mortal hearts to battle and riding through the air above"
16761,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"to designate the bravest for death, and with their spirits to fill the"
16762,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"halls on Valhalla's height. Now, however, Wotan is ordering Brünnhilde"
16763,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"to haste to the fray,--not on death's errand but on errand of life,--to"
16764,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,shield Siegmund the Wälsung in the fight. The Valkyrie springs shouting
16765,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"from rock to rock, and disappears behind the mountain crags."
16766,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16767,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"All seems to be arranged. But lo, Fricka, in her ram-drawn car! She"
16768,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,descends and strides toward her scheming spouse. The goddess has heard
16769,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the cry of Hunding, calling for vengeance on the twinborn pair who"
16770,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,have rashly wrought him wrong; and as guardian of wedlock she demands
16771,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the death of Siegmund in the coming conflict. Wotan tries to persuade
16772,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"her that Siegmund's success is needful to the gods,--the warrior band"
16773,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,of mortal souls gathered by the Valkyries in the heights of Valhalla
16774,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,cannot alone suffice to avert the onslaught of the powers of darkness.
16775,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16776,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Needed is one who, free from help of godhood, fights free of the"
16777,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,godhead's control. Only such an one is meet for the deed which is
16778,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"denied to a god to achieve."""
16779,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16780,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,But Fricka is not to be deceived nor thwarted in her aim. She brushes
16781,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"aside the plea of Wotan and his subterfuge,--who has ever heard"
16782,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,that heroes can accomplish what the gods cannot? And as for heroes
16783,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,unaided--none such is Siegmund.
16784,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16785,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Who was it,"" she asks, ""that brought him his conquering sword? and"
16786,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"whose shield is ordained to cover him in the fight?"""
16787,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16788,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""I cannot o'erthrow him,"" breaks out Wotan; ""he has found my sword."""
16789,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16790,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Destroy its magic then,"" retorts the implacable queen. ""Give word to"
16791,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"thy shouting war-maid that Siegmund fall!"""
16792,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16793,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Wotan is conquered. Sadly he revokes the order given to Brünnhilde.
16794,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16795,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Then takest thou from Siegmund thy shield?"" cries that one in"
16796,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,amazement.
16797,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16798,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"And the god: ""Yea! though Alberich's host threaten our downfall; though"
16799,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"again the Ring be won by the Nibelung, and Valhalla be lost forever."
16800,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"By bargains bound myself, I may not wrest the Ring from the foeman,"
16801,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"from Fafner the giant. Therefore, to fulfill my purpose, I had thought"
16802,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"to create a Free One who for me should fight. Now, with loathing, I"
16803,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,find ever myself in all my hand has created. The Other for whom I
16804,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"have longed, that Other I never shall find. Himself must the Free One"
16805,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,create him; my hand shapes nothing but slaves. For when this hand of
16806,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"mine touched Alberich's Ring, my heart grew greedy of gold. I fled"
16807,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"from the curse, but the curse flies not from me. What I love best must"
16808,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"I surrender; whom most I cherish, I must slay. One thing awaits me"
16809,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"yet--the downfall! Yea, that portended Erda,--Erda, the all-wise."
16810,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16811,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""'When the dusky foe,' she said,--"

16825,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16826,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,But Brünnhilde?
16827,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,

16833,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"The war-father turns in wrath upon this new rebellion, and on pain of"

16836,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Fight truly for Fricka! Siegmund strike thou! Such be the Valkyrie's"

16838,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16839,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The war-maid seeks out Siegmund and announces to him his approaching
16840,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,death. But that hero's distress at the thought of parting from
16841,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Sieglinde stirs her to the quick. And, in the moment of battle,"
16842,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Brünnhilde disobeys the All-father's injunction;--she shields the
16843,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"warrior whom she loves. Then suddenly appears Wotan, standing over"
16844,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Hunding and holding his spear across in front of Siegmund.
16845,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16846,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Go back from the spear! In splinters the sword!"" shouts the god."
16847,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16848,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,In terror Brünnhilde sinks back. Siegmund's sword breaks on the
16849,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"outstretched spear, and Hunding pierces the Volsung's breast."
16850,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Brünnhilde hastily gathers the bits of the broken sword, lifts"
16851,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Sieglinde to horse, and escapes through the gorges behind."
16852,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16853,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The scene changes to the Valkyries' rocky home. Through the drifting
16854,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"clouds come riding the eight sisters of Brünnhilde, in full armor"
16855,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"each, and each bearing before her the body of some slain hero. They"
16856,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"await Brünnhilde. She, fleeing from Wotan's pursuit, at last arrives."
16857,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"She implores them to shield Sieglinde from the wrath of the god, but"
16858,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"unsuccessfully; and then she urges Sieglinde to fly. At first, benumbed"

16909,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"in the forest ""far to the east"" to which Sieglinde had fled. Mime,"
16910,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the dwarf, is he whom erstwhile his Nibelung brother, Alberich, then"
16911,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"lord of the Ring, had held in thrall at the bottom of the Rhine. Some"
16912,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"years before the events represented in this play, the dwarf had found"
16913,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Sieglinde dying in the woods, and had received from her Siegfried,"
16914,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"her new-born son, and with him the pieces of Siegmund's broken sword,"
16915,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Nothung.
16916,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16917,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Young Siegfried, noble, proud, and strong, has been nurtured in"
16918,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"ignorance of his lineage and destiny, as Mime's son. But of that"
16919,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,lineage and destiny the cunning dwarf is well aware; and while he
16920,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"trains Siegfried to doughty deeds, he ceaselessly forges at the"
16921,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"splinters of the sword, hoping to reweld them himself and through"
16922,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegfried's might to win victory over Fafner, the present lord of the"
16923,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Ring, and so achieve unmeasured wealth and the mastery of the world."
16924,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,But Siegfried despises his foster-father and seeks ever to discover the
16925,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,story of his own descent. The attempts of Mime to shape anew the pieces
16926,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"of Nothung fail; and he daily forges other swords, which Siegfried"
16927,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"scorns and breaks at the first trial. In the course of time, however,"
16928,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"there comes to Mime's cave a ""Wanderer""--it is Wotan himself--and tells"
16929,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the dwarf that only one, a man who knows not fear, can remake the"
16930,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"all-conquering sword. He tells him, too, of the mighty spear, fashioned"
16931,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"of the world ash tree's hallowed branches, with which he, Wotan, rules"
16932,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the earth. But no word he says of the doom that is to befall that spear
16933,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"at the blow of the conquering sword,--the doom, forsooth, of the gods"
16934,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,themselves.
16935,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16936,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Mime, after trying in vain to arouse in Siegfried the sense of fear,"
16937,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,suggests to the youth that he try to reforge Nothung. Siegfried seizes
16938,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the splinters, pounds them, and files them to powder; melts them"
16939,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"over the charcoal of the ash tree's stem, and, singing at his work,"
16940,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"refashions the sword. While this is doing, through the pauses of"
16941,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegfried's song can be heard the voice of Mime, muttering: ""The sword"
16942,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,will be forged ... and Fafner vanquished.... When Siegfried has slain
16943,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,that dragon ... he will be athirst.... I will brew him a drink.... One
16944,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,drop will lay him in sleep.... With the sword that he forges I'll kill

16946,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16947,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,At last the sword is shaped and sharpened. Siegfried swings it before

16952,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"sunders Siegfried's sword!"" and he strikes the anvil in twain from top"
16953,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"to bottom. It falls asunder with a great noise, and the dwarf drops"
16954,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,with terror to the ground.
16955,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16956,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The scene changes to the forest in front of Fafner's cave. Alberich is
16957,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"watching gloomily by, and the Wanderer rides in to taunt him with false"

16959,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16960,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""A hero nears to set free the hoard,"" says the Wanderer. ""Fafner will"

16963,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16964,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Alberich makes the approaches. Fafner yawns: ""I have and I hold; let me"

16970,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16971,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"As the day breaks Siegfried and Mime enter, Siegfried wearing his sword"
16972,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"hung in a girdle of rope, and blithely blowing a horn. Fafner, in the"
16973,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"shape of a huge lizardlike dragon, comes out of his cave and forward"
16974,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,to the stream for water. At sight of the nonchalant youth piping his
16975,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"wood-notes gay, the monster emits a snort that serves his need of a"

16977,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
16978,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The conflict is speedily joined. More than once Siegfried is well-nigh
16979,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"lost; but his chance comes. The dragon exposes his heart, and Siegfried"
16980,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"sinks his sword into it up to the hilt. In the moment of death, Fafner"
16981,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,warns the young hero to beware of him who stirred him to the fight.
16982,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,But Siegfried pays little heed. The blood of the dragon bespatters his
16983,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,hand; it burns. Siegfried involuntarily carries his hand to his lips.
16984,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,There is a wood bird singing. Siegfried regards him with astonishment.
16985,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Almost,"" he says, ""it seems as wood birds were speaking to me,"" and he"

16992,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Thanks, dearest birdling,"" Siegfried replies, and possesses himself of"

17004,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,horn and offers it.
17005,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17006,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Taste thou my sword, loathsome babbler!"" cries the young hero, and"
17007,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,strikes him dead at a blow; then pitches his body on top of the hoard
17008,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,and stops up the mouth of the cave with the grinning corpse of the

17010,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,

17145,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and is made welcome. Gutrune, at the instigation of Hagen, brings"
17146,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegfried a potion which causes him to love her, and drives clean out"
17147,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,of his mind all memory of Brünnhilde. In the madness of his passion for
17148,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Gutrune, Siegfried swears blood-brotherhood with Gunther, and promises"
17149,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"by the aid of the Tarnhelm to make Brünnhilde Gunther's wife, if only"
17150,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"in return Gutrune shall be his. The newly sworn ""brothers"" depart for"
17151,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Brünnhilde's rock.
17152,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17153,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,In the next scene we are again before the home of Brünnhilde.
17154,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Waltraute, a Valkyrie, comes to beg Brünnhilde to give back the Ring to"
17155,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the Rhine-maidens, and so avert the doom of the gods."
17156,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17157,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""What, then, aileth the immortals?"" cries Brünnhilde in alarm."
17158,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17159,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Since Wotan doomed thee, no more hath he sent us to war,"" replies"
17160,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Waltraute. ""No more hath he gathered the souls of the slain about him"
17161,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"in Valhalla. Alone he has ridden unceasing through the world. But,"
17162,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"one day, home he came bearing his spear all splintered in his hand."
17163,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Wordless, with a sign he bade Valhalla's heroes hew the world ash tree"
17164,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,in pieces and pile it like firewood around the Hall of the Blest. And
17165,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"from that hour silent he sits on his throne, about him the awe-struck"
17166,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"gods and heroes, the war-maids cowering at his knees. None tastes the"
17167,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"apples of youth. To-day Wotan remembered thee; his eye grew soft and,"
17168,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"as dreaming, he spake:"
17169,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17170,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,'If once more the daughters of Rhine
17171,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Should win from her finger the Ring,"
17172,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Of the load of the curse
17173,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Were the world and immortals made free.'
17174,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17175,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Brünnhilde, yield up the Ring, and end all the grief of the world!"""
17176,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17177,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""The Ring?"" wails Brünnhilde. ""Knowest thou what 'tis to me? One flash"
17178,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,of its fire outvalues all heaven's delight; for the gleam of that Ring
17179,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,is Siegfried's love!
17180,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17181,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""From love I never shall turn;"
17182,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Of his love they never shall rob me,"
17183,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Though into ruins
17184,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Valhalla's splendor should fall!"""
17185,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17186,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Thus Brünnhilde refuses, and sends Waltraute away to take her defiance"
17187,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,to Valhalla.
17188,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17189,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"But retribution is swift, for on the moment Siegfried, changed to"
17190,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Gunther's shape by the Tarnhelm, comes and claims Brünnhilde as his"
17191,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"bride. She resists and threatens him with the Ring. But now Siegfried,"
17192,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"forgetful of the past, struggles for another with his own dear wife,"
17193,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"overcomes her, and wrests the Ring from her. He then commands her to go"
17194,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"into the cave, whither, after drawing his sword to lay between them as"
17195,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"symbol of his loyalty to Gunther, he follows her."
17196,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17197,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The second act is outside the Gibichungs' hall. It is early morning of
17198,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the next day. After a short scene in which the ever-plotting Alberich
17199,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"urges Hagen to get the Ring, Siegfried returns and tells Hagen and"
17200,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Gutrune of the winning of Brünnhilde and her approach with Gunther.
17201,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Hagen calls together the vassals to welcome Gunther and his bride.
17202,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The royal pair presently arrive and are received with loud acclaim.
17203,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Straightway Brünnhilde recognizes Siegfried (who, however, does not"
17204,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"know her) and, seeing the Ring on Siegfried's finger, she asks Gunther"
17205,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,what he has done with the ring he took from her. His confusion reveals
17206,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"the truth to her, and she proclaims that she is wedded to Siegfried and"
17207,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,not to Gunther. Siegfried swears on the point of Hagen's spear that her
17208,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"accusation is false. She repeats it, taking the same oath. Siegfried,"
17209,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Gutrune, and their vassals go out to prepare for the double wedding"
17210,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"celebration; Gunther, Hagen, and Brünnhilde remaining solemnly condemn"
17211,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegfried to death for what seems treachery to one and all. Hagen, left"
17212,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"alone, glories in the prospect of regaining the Ring."
17213,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17214,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The third act discloses an open place on the banks of the Rhine. The
17215,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,three Rhine-maidens pray to the sun for the return of the Rhine-gold.
17216,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegfried, who has strayed from his companions on a hunting expedition,"
17217,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"comes to the river bank. The maidens unsuccessfully attempt, by wiles"
17218,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and warnings of ill fate, to get the Ring from him, and finally swim"
17219,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"away, foretelling his death that very day. Gunther, Hagen, and their"
17220,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"vassals come to the place, and all sit down to rest. At Hagen's"
17221,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"suggestion Siegfried relates the story of his life. But, lo! when he"
17222,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"comes to the episode of his first passage through the fire, a draft"
17223,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"given him by Hagen restores his memory, and innocently he tells of the"
17224,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,waking and winning of Brünnhilde. All start up in amaze; Hagen stabs
17225,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegfried in the back with his spear, and steals away. Siegfried falls,"
17226,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"and after a few words sung to Brünnhilde, whom he sees as in a vision,"
17227,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,he dies. His body is placed on a bier and borne away by the vassals
17228,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,with great pomp and state as the sun sets.
17229,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17230,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,In the last scene we have the interior of the Gibichungs' hall as
17231,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,before. It is night. Gutrune comes from her chamber anxious for
17232,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Siegfried. Presently Hagen's voice is heard calling for torches to
17233,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"light the returning hunters. He enters and, in reply to Gutrune's"
17234,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"questions, tells her that Siegfried has been slain by a wild boar. Then"
17235,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"come the vassals, bearing Siegfried's body. It is placed on a bier in"
17236,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,the center of the hall. Hagen claims the Ring as his right for slaying
17237,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Siegfried, but Gunther defies him to touch Gutrune's heritage. They"
17238,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,fight and Gunther falls. As Hagen approaches the corpse to take the
17239,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Ring, the dead Siegfried raises his arm threateningly. All start back"
17240,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"in horror, and just then Brünnhilde enters and comes down to the bier."
17241,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Here, after ordering a pyre to be built on the river bank, she sings"
17242,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"a funeral song over Siegfried. The body, from which she has taken the"
17243,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Ring, is then placed on the pyre. Setting the Ring on her own finger,"
17244,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Brünnhilde calls on the Rhine-maidens to take it in turn from her ashes:
17245,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17246,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Let fire, burning this hand"
17247,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Cleanse, too, the Ring from its curse."""
17248,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17249,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,She applies the torch:
17250,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17251,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""So cast I the brand"
17252,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,On Valhall's glittering walls.--
17253,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"When ye see in the kindling fire,"
17254,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Siegfried and Brünnhild' consumed;
17255,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,When ye see the river-daughters
17256,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Bear the Ring away to the deep:
17257,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,To northward then
17258,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Look through the night!
17259,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,When the heaven there gleams
17260,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"With a holy glow,"
17261,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Then know ye all
17262,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"That Valhall's end ye behold!"""
17263,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17264,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Her horse is brought. She mounts it and springs into the flames, which"
17265,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,flare up and seize on the hall itself. The river overflows and rolls
17266,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,over the fire. The Rhine-maidens swim up and regain the Ring. Hagen
17267,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"rushes into the flood to get it from them, but is dragged down to the"
17268,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,depths by their arms as they swim away. In the sky is seen a vision of
17269,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Valhalla in flames.
17270,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17271,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,The breed of the gods is gone like breath. The loveless Ring has
17272,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,worked its curse. Each in his turn its lords have bitten the dust. And
17273,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Brünnhilde reads the moral:
17274,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,
17275,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"""Not goods nor gold"
17276,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,Nor glory of gods
17277,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Can fashion a blessing for weal,"
17278,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"Can win a blessing from woe,--"
17279,THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG,"But Love alone!"""

17301,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,=289. Kinds of Myth.= If we classify the preceding stories according
17302,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"to the reason of their existence, we observe that they are of two"
17303,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"kinds,--explanatory and æsthetic."
17304,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17305,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"(1) _Explanatory myths_ are the outcome of naïve guesses at the truth,"
17306,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of mistaken and superstitious attempts to satisfy the curiosity of
17307,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"primitive and unenlightened peoples, to unveil the mysteries of"
17308,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"existence, make clear the facts of the universe and the experiences"
17309,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of life, to account for religious rites and social customs of which"
17310,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the origin is forgotten, to teach the meaning and the history of"
17311,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,things. There are certain questions that nearly every child and
17312,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,every savage asks: What is the world and what is man? Who made them?
17313,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,What else did the maker do? and what the first men? Whence came the
17314,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"commodities of life? Why do we celebrate certain festivals, practice"
17315,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"certain ceremonials, observe solemnities, and partake of sacraments,"
17316,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and bow to this or the other god? What is death, and what becomes"
17317,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of us after death? The answers to such questions crystallized
17318,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"themselves gradually into stories of the creation, of the gods, and"
17319,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of the heroes--forefathers of men, but magnified, because unfamiliar,"
17320,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"mysterious, and remote."
17321,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17322,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Old literatures abound in explanatory myths of so highly imaginative
17323,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,a character that we moderns are tempted to read into them meanings
17324,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,which probably they never possessed. For the diverse and contradictory
17325,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,significations that have in recent years been proposed for one and the
17326,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"same myth could not all, at any one time, have been entertained by the"
17327,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"myth-makers. On the other hand, the current explanations of certain"
17328,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"myths are sufficiently apparent to be probable. ""To the ancients,"""
17329,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"says John Fiske,[375] ""the moon was not a lifeless body of stones and"
17330,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"clods; it was the horned huntress Artemis, coursing through the upper"
17331,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"ether, or bathing herself in the clear lake; or it was Aphrodite,"
17332,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"protectress of lovers, born of the sea foam in the East, near Cyprus."
17333,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The clouds were not bodies of vaporized water; they were cows, with"
17334,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"swelling udders, driven to the milking by Hermes, the summer wind;"
17335,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"or great sheep with moist fleeces, slain by the unerring arrows of"
17336,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Bellerophon, the sun; or swan-maidens, flitting across the firmament;"
17337,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Valkyries hovering over the battle field to receive the souls of
17338,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"falling heroes; or, again, they were mighty mountains, piled one above"
17339,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"another, in whose cavernous recesses the divining wand of the storm-god"
17340,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Thor revealed hidden treasures. The yellow-haired sun, Ph[oe]bus, drove"
17341,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"westerly all day in his flaming chariot; or, perhaps, as Meleager,"
17342,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,retired for awhile in disgust from the sight of men; wedded at eventide
17343,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the violet light ([OE]none, Iole) which he had forsaken in the morning;"
17344,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"sank as Hercules upon a blazing funeral pyre, or, like Agamemnon,"
17345,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"perished in a blood-stained bath; or, as the fish-god, Dagon, swam"
17346,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,nightly through the subterranean waters to appear eastward again at
17347,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"daybreak. Sometimes Phaëthon, his rash, inexperienced son, would take"
17348,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the reins and drive the solar chariot too near the earth, causing"
17349,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the fruits to perish, and the grass to wither, and the wells to dry"
17350,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"up. Sometimes, too, the great all-seeing divinity, in his wrath at"
17351,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the impiety of men, would shoot down his scorching arrows, causing"
17352,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"pestilence to spread over the land."""
17353,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17354,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,(2) _Æsthetic myths_ have their origin in the universal desire for
17355,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"amusement, in the revulsion of the mind from the humdrum of actuality."
17356,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"They furnish information that may not be practical, but is delightful;"
17357,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"they elicit emotion--sympathy, tears, and laughter--for characters and"
17358,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,events remote from our commonplace experience but close to the heart of
17359,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"things, and near and significant and enchanting to us in the atmosphere"
17360,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of imagination that embraces severed continents, inspires the dead"
17361,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"with life, bestows color and breath upon the creatures of a dream, and"
17362,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,wraps young and old in the wonder of hearing a new thing. The æsthetic
17363,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"myth, first, removes us from the sordid world of immediate and selfish"
17364,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"needs, and then unrolls a vision of a world where men and things exist"
17365,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,simply for the purpose of delighting us. And the enduring measure of
17366,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,delight which the æsthetic myth affords is the test of what we call its
17367,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,_beauty_.
17368,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17369,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"A myth, whether explanatory or æsthetic, is of unconscious growth,"
17370,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,almost never concocted with a view to instruction.
17371,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17372,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"According to their subjects, æsthetic myths are either historic or"
17373,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"romantic. (_a_) If _historic_, they utilize events which have a"
17374,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,skeleton of fact. They supply flesh and sinew of divine or heroic
17375,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"adventure and character, blood and breath of probability and"
17376,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"imagination. In historic myths the dependence of gods, heroes, and"
17377,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"events upon the stern necessity of an overruling power, of fate or"
17378,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"providence, is especially to be observed. Of this class is the Iliad of"
17379,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Homer.
17380,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17381,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"(_b_) If _romantic_, the myths are characterized by bolder selection or"
17382,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"creation of fundamental events; indeed, events appear to be chosen with"
17383,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,a view to displaying or developing the character of the hero. In such
17384,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,myths circumstances are not so important as what the hero does with
17385,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,circumstances. The hero is more independent than in the historic myth;
17386,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"his liberty, his choice,--in judgment, in conduct, and in feeling,--his"
17387,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"responsibility, are the center of interest. In romantic myths like the"
17388,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Odyssey this sense of freedom does not impel the poet to capricious
17389,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,use of his material. But lesser bards than Homer have permitted their
17390,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,heroes to run riot in adventures that weary the imagination and offend
17391,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the moral judgment.

17393,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,=290. Divisions of Inquiry.= We are next led to ask how these myths
17394,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"came into existence, and how it is that the same myth meets us under"
17395,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,various forms in literatures and among peoples widely separate in time
17396,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,and place. These are questions of the _Origin_ and _Distribution_ of
17397,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,myths; and in this chapter we shall discuss the former.
17398,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17399,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,=291. Elements of the Myth.= The myths preserved in the literatures of
17400,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"many civilized nations, such as the Greek, present to the imaginative"
17401,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,and the moral sense aspects fraught with contradiction. In certain
17402,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"myths the gods display themselves as beautiful, wise, and beneficent"
17403,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"beings; in others they indulge in cruel, foolish, and unbeautiful"
17404,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,practices and adventures. These contradictory elements have been called
17405,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the reasonable and the senseless. A myth of Mother Earth (Demeter)
17406,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"mourning the loss of her daughter, the Springtide, is reasonable; a"
17407,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"myth of Demeter devouring, in a fit of abstraction, the shoulder of"
17408,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the boy Pelops, and replacing it with ivory, is capricious, apparently"
17409,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"senseless. ""It is this silly, senseless, and savage element,"" as Max"
17410,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Müller says, ""that makes mythology the puzzle which men have so long"
17411,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"found it."""
17412,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17413,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"=292. Reasonable Myths.= If myths were always reasonable, it would not"
17414,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,be difficult to reach an agreement concerning some way by which they
17415,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,may have come into existence.
17416,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17417,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,_Imagination._ If we assume that the peoples who invented these
17418,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"stories of supernatural beings and events had, with due allowance"
17419,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"for the discrepancy in mental development, imaginations like our"
17420,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"own, there is nothing in the history of reasonable myths to baffle"
17421,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"our understanding. For, at the present time, not only children and"
17422,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"simple-minded men, like sailors or mountaineers, but cultivated men of"
17423,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"ordinary poetic sensibility, bestow attributes of life upon inanimate"
17424,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"things and abstract ideas. The sun is nowadays thirsty, the ship is"
17425,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"a woman, the clouds threaten, charity suffereth long, the waves are"
17426,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"angry, time will tell, and death swallows all things. The sun still"
17427,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"rises, and, as Mr. Jasper maintains, ""do move."" By personification we,"
17428,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"every day, bestow the attributes of human beings upon inanimate nature,"
17429,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"animals, and abstractions. By our metaphors we perpetuate and diffuse"
17430,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the poetic illusion; we talk not perhaps of the arrows of Apollo, but"
17431,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of a sunstroke; our poetry abounds in symbols of the moon, of the"
17432,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"swift-wingèd wind, of the ravening sea. In our metonymies we use the"
17433,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"sign for the thing signified, the crown for the king, the flag for the"
17434,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,honor of the country; and the crown and the flag are to-day possessed
17435,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of attributes and individuality just as efficient as those that endowed
17436,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the golden handmaids of Vulcan or the eagle of Jove. Nor is hyperbole
17437,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,any less in use among us than it was among the ancients; we glorify
17438,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"our political heroes with superlatives, they dignified theirs with"
17439,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,divinity.
17440,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17441,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"_Belief._ But this resemblance in habits of imagination, while it"
17442,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"may help us to appreciate the mental condition of primitive peoples,"
17443,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"accentuates the distinction between our imagination and theirs. They,"
17444,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"at some time or other, believed in these personifications. We do not"
17445,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,believe. But their belief is easier to comprehend when we remember
17446,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,that the myths of savages are not a deliberate invention of any one
17447,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"individual, but are constructed by generations of people, and that"
17448,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,many of them cluster about beings who were actually worshiped. Among
17449,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,primitive nations the sense of awe in the presence of magnificent
17450,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"objects of nature--mountains, the sky, the sun, the sea--is universal."
17451,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,It springs from the fact that savages do not deem themselves superior
17452,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,to nature. They are not conscious of souls whose flight is higher
17453,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"than that of nature. On the contrary, since sun, sea, and winds move,"
17454,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the savage invests them with free will and personality like man's. In
17455,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"proportion, however, as their size is grander or their movement more"
17456,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"tremendous, these objects must be possessed of freedom, personality,"
17457,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and power exceeding those of man. Why, then, should not the savage"
17458,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"believe, of beings worthy of worship and fear and gratitude, all and"
17459,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,more than all that is accredited to man? Why not confer upon them human
17460,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and superhuman passions and powers? If we were living, like the Greek"
17461,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of old, close to the heart of nature, such personification of natural"
17462,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,powers would be more easy for us to appreciate.
17463,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17464,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"""If for us also, as for the Greek,"" says Ruskin,[376] ""the sunrise"
17465,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,means daily restoration to the sense of passionate gladness and of
17466,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,perfect life--if it means the thrilling of new strength through every
17467,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"nerve,--the shedding over us of a better peace than the peace of night,"
17468,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"in the power of the dawn,--and the purging of evil vision and fear by"
17469,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the baptism of its dew;--if the sun itself is an influence, to us also,"
17470,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of spiritual good,--and becomes thus in reality, not in imagination,"
17471,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"to us also, a spiritual power,--we may then soon overpass the narrow"
17472,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"limit of conception which kept that power impersonal, and rise with the"
17473,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Greek to the thought of an angel who rejoiced as a strong man to run
17474,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"his course, whose voice, calling to life and to labor, rang round the"
17475,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"earth, and whose going forth was to the ends of heaven."""
17476,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17477,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Regarding thus the religious condition of the savage, we may comprehend"
17478,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the existence of myths and his acceptance of them.

17480,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,=293. Unreasonable Myths.= But he would maintain this attitude of
17481,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,acceptance only in the matter of good and beneficent gods and of
17482,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,righteous or reasonable myths.
17483,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17484,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,For how could a human being believe of the god whom he worshiped and
17485,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"revered, deeds and attributes more silly and more shameful than man"
17486,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"can conceive of his fellow man? When, therefore, we find senseless"
17487,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,and shameless myths existing side by side with stories of the justice
17488,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and righteousness of the same god, we must conclude that, since the"
17489,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"worshiper could not believe both sets of attributes, he preserved his"
17490,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,religious attitude before the good god only by virtue of rejecting the
17491,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,senseless myth.
17492,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17493,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,A man's religious belief would assist him to entertain only the
17494,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"reasonable myths. How, then, did the senseless and cruel stories come"
17495,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,into existence? And were they ever believed?
17496,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17497,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"There are many answers to these questions. They may, however, be"
17498,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,classified according to the theory of civilization that they assume.
17499,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17500,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"According to the _Theory of Deterioration_, or Human Depravity, man,"
17501,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"although he had in the beginning knowledge of common facts, pure moral"
17502,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and religious ideas, and true poetic conceptions, has forgotten, with"
17503,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the lapse of time, the significance of words, facts, men, and events,"
17504,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"adopted corrupt moral and religious notions, and given license to the"
17505,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,diseased imagining of untrue and unlovely conceptions.
17506,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17507,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"According to the _Theory of Improvement_, or Progress, man, beginning"
17508,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"with crude dreams and fancies about experience, life, the world, and"
17509,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"God, has gradually developed truer and higher conceptions of his own"
17510,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"nature, of his relation to the world about him, of duty, of art, and of"
17511,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,religion.
17512,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17513,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,=294. Theory of Deterioration.= Let us consider first the
17514,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,interpretations of mythology that assume a backward tendency in early
17515,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,civilization. They are:
17516,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17517,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"(1) The _Historical_, or better called after its author, Euhemerus"
17518,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"(B.C. 316), the _Euhemeristic_. This explanation assumes that myths"
17519,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of the gods are exaggerated adventures of historic individuals,"
17520,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"chieftains, medicine men, heroes; and that supernatural events"
17521,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"are distortions of natural but wonderful occurrences. In fact, it"
17522,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,attributes to our forefathers a disease of the memory which prompted
17523,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"them to pervert facts. Jupiter, Odin, and Hercules were accordingly men"
17524,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"who, after death, had been glorified, then deified, then invested with"
17525,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,numerous characteristics and adventures appropriate to their exalted
17526,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,conditions of existence.
17527,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17528,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The custom of worshiping ancestors, still existent in China and other"
17529,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"countries, is adduced in support of this method of investigating myths,"
17530,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,and it is undoubtedly true that the method explains the origin and
17531,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,growth of some myths. But it accounts rather for the reasonable than
17532,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the senseless element of mythical adventure, while it fails to show how"
17533,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,savages come to exaggerate their heroes into beings entirely out of the
17534,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,realm of that actual experience which is the basis of the historical
17535,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,assumption.
17536,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17537,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,(2) _The Philological Interpretation_[377] assumes also a disease
17538,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of the memory by reason of which men misunderstand and confuse the
17539,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"meanings of words, and misapply the words themselves. Professor Max"
17540,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Müller calls this affection a disease of language. In ancient languages
17541,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"every such word as _day_, _night_, _earth_, _sun_, _spring_, _dawn_,"
17542,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"had an ending expressive of gender, which naturally produced the"
17543,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,corresponding idea of sex. These objects accordingly became in the
17544,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"process of generations not only persons, but male and female. As, also,"
17545,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the phrases expressing the existence or the activity of these natural
17546,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"objects lost their ancient signification under new colloquial coloring,"
17547,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,primitive and simple statements of natural events acquired the garb and
17548,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"dignity of elaborate and often incongruous narratives, no longer about"
17549,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"natural events, but about persons. Ancient language may, for instance,"
17550,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,have said _sunrise_ follows the _dawn_. The word for sun was masculine;
17551,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the word for dawn, feminine. In time the sentence came to mean,"
17552,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Apollo, the god of the sun, _chases_ Daphne, the maiden of the glowing"
17553,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"dawn. But the word, _Daphne_, meant also a laurel that burned easily,"
17554,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"hence might readily be devoted to the god of the sun. So Daphne, the"
17555,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"maiden, assuming the form of Daphne, the laurel, escaped the pursuit"
17556,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of her ardent lover, by becoming the tree sacred to his worship.[378]"
17557,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The merit of the philological method is, that, tracing the name of a"
17558,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"mythical character through kindred languages, it frequently ascertains"
17559,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"for us the family of the myth, brings to light kindred forms of the"
17560,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"myth, discovers in what language the name was born, and sometimes,"
17561,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"giving us the original meaning of the divine name, ""throws light on the"
17562,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"legend of the bearer of the name and on its origin and first home.""[379]"
17563,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17564,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,But unfortunately there is very often no agreement among scholars
17565,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,about the original meaning of the names of mythical beings. The same
17566,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,name is frequently explained in half a dozen different ways. The same
17567,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,deity is reduced by different interpreters to half a dozen elements of
17568,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"nature. A certain goddess represents now the upper air, now light, now"
17569,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"lightning, and yet again clouds. Naturally the attempts at construing"
17570,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,her adventures must terminate in correspondingly dissimilar and
17571,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"unconvincing results. In fine, the philological explanation assumes"
17572,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,as its starting point masculine and feminine names for objects of
17573,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,nature. It does not attempt to show how an object like the ocean came
17574,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"to be male and not female, or how it came to be a person at all. And"
17575,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"this latter, in studying the origin of myths, is what should first be"
17576,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"ascertained. We must not, however, fall into the error of supposing"
17577,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,that the philologists look for the origin and growth of all myths in
17578,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,words and the diseases of words. Max Müller grants that mythology does
17579,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"not always create its own heroes, but sometimes lays hold of real"
17580,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,history. He insists that mythologists should bear in mind that there
17581,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,may be in every mythological riddle elements which resist etymological
17582,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"analysis, for the simple reason that their origin was not etymological,"
17583,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,but historical.
17584,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17585,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,(3) _The Allegorical Interpretation_ is akin to the philological in its
17586,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,results. It leads us to explain myths as embodiments in symbolic guise
17587,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of hidden meaning: of physical, chemical, or astronomical facts; or of"
17588,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"moral, religious, philosophical truth. The stories would at first exist"
17589,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"as allegories, but in process of time would come to be understood"
17590,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"literally. Thus Cronus, who devours his own children, is identified"
17591,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"with the power that the Greeks called Chronos (Time), which may truly"
17592,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,be said to destroy whatever it has brought into existence. The story
17593,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of Io is interpreted in a similar manner. Io is the moon, and Argus"
17594,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the starry sky, which, as it were, keeps sleepless watch over her. The"
17595,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,fabulous wanderings of Io represent the continual revolutions of the
17596,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,moon. This method of explanation rests upon the assumption that the
17597,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"men who made the allegories were proficient in physics, chemistry,"
17598,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"astronomy, etc., and clever in allegory; but that, for some unknown"
17599,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"reason, their descendants becoming stupid, knowledge as well as wit"
17600,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"deserted the race. In some cases the myth was, without doubt, from the"
17601,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,first an allegory; but where the myth was consciously fashioned as
17602,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"an allegory, in all probability it was preserved as such. It is not,"
17603,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"however, likely that allegories of deep scientific or philosophical"
17604,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,import were invented by savages. Where the myth has every mark of
17605,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"great antiquity,--is especially silly and senseless and savage,--it"
17606,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"is safe to believe that any profound allegorical meaning, read into"
17607,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"it, is the work of men of a later generation, who thus attempted to"
17608,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,make reasonable the divine and heroic narratives which they could not
17609,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"otherwise justify and of whose existence they were ashamed. We find,"
17610,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"moreover, in some cases a great variety of symbolic explanations of the"
17611,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"same myth, one with as great claim to credence as another, since they"
17612,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"spring from the same source,--the caprice or fancy of the expounder."
17613,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17614,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Among the ancients Theagenes of Rhegium, six hundred years before"
17615,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Christ, suggested the allegorical theory and method of interpretation."
17616,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"In modern times he has been supported by Lord Bacon, whose ""Wisdom of"
17617,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the Ancients"" treats myths as ""elegant and instructive fables,"" and by"
17618,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"many Germans, especially Professor Creuzer."
17619,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17620,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"(4) _The Theological Interpretation._ This premises that mankind,"
17621,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"either in general or through some chosen nationality, received from"
17622,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"God an original revelation of pure religious ideas, and that, with the"
17623,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"systematic and continued perversion of the moral sense, this knowledge"
17624,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of truth, morality, and spiritual religion fell into corruption."
17625,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,So in Greek mythology the attributes of the various gods would be
17626,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,imperfect irradiations of the attributes of the one God. A more limited
17627,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"conception is, that all mythological legends are derived from the"
17628,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"narratives of Scripture, though the real facts have been disguised"
17629,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and altered. Thus, Deucalion is only another name for Noah, Hercules"
17630,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"for Samson, Arion for Jonah, etc. Sir Walter Raleigh, in his ""History"
17631,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of the World,"" says, ""Jubal, Tubal, and Tubal-Cain were Mercury,"
17632,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Vulcan, and Apollo, inventors of pasturage, smithing, and music. The"
17633,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,dragon which kept the golden apples was the serpent that beguiled Eve.
17634,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Nimrod's tower was the attempt of the giants against heaven."" There"
17635,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"are doubtless many curious coincidences like these, but the theory"
17636,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"cannot, without extravagance, be pushed so far as to account for any"
17637,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,great proportion of the stories. For many myths antedate the scriptural
17638,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"narratives of which they are said to be copies; many more, though"
17639,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"resembling the scriptural stories, originated among peoples ignorant"
17640,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of the Hebrew Bible. The theory rests upon two unproved assumptions:
17641,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"one, that all nations have had a chance to be influenced by the same"
17642,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"set of religious doctrines; the other, that God made his revelation in"
17643,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the beginning once for all, and has done nothing to help man toward"
17644,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,righteousness since then. The theological theory has been advocated by
17645,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Voss and other Germans in the seventeenth century, by Jacob Bryant in"
17646,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"1774, and in this century most ably by Gladstone.[380]"
17647,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17648,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,=295.= We are now ready for the explanation of myth-making based upon
17649,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the =Theory of Progress=. This is best stated by Mr. Andrew Lang,[381]"
17650,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"whose argument is, when possible, given in his own language. To the"
17651,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"question how the senseless element got into myths, the advocates"
17652,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of this theory answer that it was in the minds and in the social
17653,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,condition of the savages who invented the myths. But since we cannot
17654,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,put ourselves back in history thousands of years to examine the habits
17655,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of thought and life of early savages, we are constrained to examine"
17656,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"whether anywhere nowadays there may exist ""any stage of the human"
17657,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,intellect in which these divine adventures and changes of men into
17658,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"animals, trees, stars, this belief in seeing and talking with the dead,"
17659,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"are regarded as possible incidents of daily human life."" As the result"
17660,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of such scientific investigation, numerous races of savages have been"
17661,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,found who at this present day accept and believe just such silly and
17662,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,senseless elements of myth as puzzle us and have puzzled many of the
17663,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,cultivated ancients who found them in their inherited mythologies.
17664,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The theory of development is, then, that ""the savage and senseless"
17665,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"element in mythology is, for the most part, a legacy from ancestors"
17666,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of civilized races who, at the time that they invented the senseless"
17667,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"stories, were in an intellectual state not higher than that of our"
17668,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"contemporary Australians, Bushmen, Red Indians, the lower races of"
17669,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"South America, and other worse than barbaric people of the nineteenth"
17670,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"century."" But what are the characteristics of the mental state of"
17671,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"our contemporary savages? First and foremost, _curiosity_ that leads"
17672,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"them to inquire into the causes of things; and second, _credulity_"
17673,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,that impels them to invent or to accept childish stories that may
17674,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"satisfy their untutored experience. We find, moreover, that savages"
17675,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,nowadays think of everything around them as having life and the parts
17676,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and passions of persons like themselves. ""The sky, sun, wind, sea,"
17677,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"earth, mountains, trees, regarded as persons, are mixed up with men,"
17678,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"beasts, stars, and stones on the same level of personality and life."""
17679,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The forces of nature, animals, and things have for these Polynesians"
17680,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,and Bushmen the same powers and attributes that men have; and in their
17681,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,opinion men have the following attributes:
17682,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17683,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"""1. Relationship to animals and ability to be transformed, and to"
17684,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"transform others, into animals and other objects."
17685,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17686,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"""2. Magical accomplishments, such as power to call up ghosts, or to"
17687,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"visit ghosts and the region of the dead; power over the seasons, the"
17688,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"sun, moon, stars, weather, and so forth.""[382]"
17689,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17690,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,The stories of savages to-day abound in adventures based upon qualities
17691,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,and incidents like these. If these stories should survive in the
17692,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"literature of these nations after the nations have been civilized,"
17693,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,they would appear senseless and silly and cruel to the descendants of
17694,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"our contemporary savages. In like manner, ""as the ancient Greeks,"
17695,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Egyptians, and Norsemen advanced in civilization, their religious"
17696,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,thought and artistic taste were shocked by myths which were preserved
17697,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"by local priesthoods, or in ancient poems, or in popular religious"
17698,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,ceremonials.... We may believe that ancient and early tribes framed
17699,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"gods like themselves in action and in experience, and that the"
17700,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,allegorical element in myths is the addition of later peoples who had
17701,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"attained to purer ideas of divinity, yet dared not reject the religion"
17702,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of their ancestors.""[383] The senseless element in the myths would,"
17703,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"by this theory, be, for the most part, a ""survival."" Instead, then,"
17704,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of deteriorating, the races that invented senseless myths are, with"
17705,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"ups and downs of civilization, intellectually and morally improved,"
17706,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,to such extent that they desire to repudiate the senseless element in
17707,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"their mythical and religious traditions, or to explain it as reasonable"
17708,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,by way of allegory. This method of research depends upon the science
17709,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of mind--psychology, and the science of man--anthropology. It may be"
17710,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"called the _Anthropological Method_. The theory is that of ""survival."""
17711,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17712,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,According to this theory many of the puzzling elements of myth resolve
17713,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"themselves into survivals of primitive philosophy, science, or history."
17714,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,From the first proceed the cruder systems of physical and spiritual
17715,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"evolution, the generations of gods and the other-world of ghosts; from"
17716,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the second, the cruder attempts at explaining the phenomena of the"
17717,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,natural and animal world by endowing them with human and frequently
17718,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"magical powers; from the third, the narratives invented to account for"
17719,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the sanctity of certain shrines and rituals, and for tribal customs and"
17720,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"ceremonials, the origin of which had been forgotten. These last are"
17721,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"known as _ætiological_ myths; they pretend to assign the _aitía_, or"
17722,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"_reason_, why Delphi, for instance, should have the oracle of Apollo,"
17723,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,or why the ritual of Demeter should be celebrated at Eleusis and in a
17724,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,certain dramatic manner.
17725,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17726,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,It is of course probable that occasionally the questionable element of
17727,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the myth originated in germs other than savage curiosity and credulity:
17728,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"for instance, in the adventures of some great hero, or in a disease of"
17729,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,language by which statements about objects came to be understood as
17730,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"stories about persons, or perhaps in a conscious allegory, or, even,"
17731,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,in the perversion of some ancient purer form of moral or religious
17732,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"truth. But, in general, the root of myth-making is to be found in the"
17733,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"mental and social condition of primitive man, the confused personality"
17734,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"that he extended to his surroundings, and the belief in magical powers"
17735,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,that he conferred upon those of his tribesmen who were shrewdest and
17736,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,most influential. This mental condition of the myth-maker should be
17737,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,premised in all scientific explanations of myth-making.
17738,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17739,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,The transition is easy from the personification of the elements of
17740,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,nature and the acceptance of fictitious history to the notion of
17741,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"supernatural beings presiding over, and governing, the different"
17742,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"objects of nature--air, fire, water, the sun, moon, and stars, the"
17743,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"mountains, forests, and streams--or possessing marvelous qualities of"
17744,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"action, passion, virtue, foresight, spirituality, and vice."
17745,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17746,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The Greeks, whose imagination was lively, peopled all nature with such"
17747,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"invisible inhabitants and powers. In Greece, says Wordsworth,[384]"
17748,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17749,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"In that fair clime the lonely herdsman, stretched"
17750,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"On the soft grass through half a summer's day,"
17751,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,With music lulled his indolent repose:
17752,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"And, in some fit of weariness, if he,"
17753,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"When his own breath was silent, chanced to hear"
17754,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"A distant strain, far sweeter than the sounds"
17755,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Which his poor skill could make, his fancy fetched,"
17756,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Even from the blazing chariot of the sun,"
17757,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"A beardless Youth, who touched a golden lute,"
17758,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,And filled the illumined groves with ravishment.
17759,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The nightly hunter, lifting a bright eye"
17760,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Up towards the crescent moon, with grateful heart"
17761,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Called on the lovely wanderer who bestowed
17762,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"That timely light, to share his joyous sport:"
17763,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"And hence, a beaming Goddess with her Nymphs,"
17764,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Across the lawn and through the darksome grove,"
17765,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Not unaccompanied with tuneful notes
17766,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"By echo multiplied from rock or cave,"
17767,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Swept in the storm of chase; as moon and stars
17768,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Glance rapidly along the clouded heaven,"
17769,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,When winds are blowing strong. The traveler slaked
17770,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"His thirst from rill or gushing fount, and thanked"
17771,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The Naiad. Sunbeams, upon distant hills"
17772,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Gliding apace, with shadows in their train,"
17773,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Might, with small help from fancy, be transformed"
17774,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Into fleet Oreads sporting visibly.
17775,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"The Zephyrs, fanning, as they passed, their wings,"
17776,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Lacked not, for love, fair objects whom they wooed"
17777,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"With gentle whisper. Withered boughs grotesque,"
17778,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Stripped of their leaves and twigs by hoary age,"
17779,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,From depth of shaggy covert peeping forth
17780,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"In the low vale, or on steep mountain side;"
17781,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"And, sometimes, intermixed with stirring horns"
17782,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Of the live deer, or goat's depending beard,--"
17783,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"These were the lurking Satyrs, a wild brood"
17784,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Of gamesome deities; or Pan himself,"
17785,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,The simple shepherd's awe-inspiring God.
17786,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17787,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,The phases of significance and beauty through which the physical or
17788,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"natural myth may develop are expressed with poetic grace by Ruskin, in"
17789,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"his ""Queen of the Air.""[385] The reader must, however, guard against"
17790,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the supposition that any myth has sprung into existence fully equipped
17791,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"with physical, religious, and moral import. Ruskin himself says, ""To"
17792,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the mean person the myth always meant little; to the noble person,"
17793,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"much."" Accordingly, as we know, to the savage the myth was savage;"
17794,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"to the devotee it became religious; to the artist, beautiful; to the"
17795,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"philosopher, recondite and significant--in the course of centuries."
17796,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17797,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"""If we seek,"" says Ruskin, ""to ascertain the manner in which the"
17798,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"story first crystallized into its shape, we shall find ourselves"
17799,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,led back generally to one or other of two sources--either to actual
17800,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"historical events, represented by the fancy under figures personifying"
17801,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"them, or else to natural phenomena similarly endowed with life by the"
17802,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"imaginative power, usually more or less under the influence of terror."
17803,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,The historical myths we must leave the masters of history to follow;
17804,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"they, and the events they record, being yet involved in great, though"
17805,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"attractive and penetrable, mystery. But the stars and hills and storms"
17806,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"are with us now, as they were with others of old; and it only needs"
17807,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,that we look at them with the earnestness of those childish eyes to
17808,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,understand the first words spoken of them by the children of men. And
17809,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"then, in all the most beautiful and enduring myths, we shall find not"
17810,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,only a literal story of a real person--not only a parallel imagery of
17811,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"moral principle--but an underlying worship of natural phenomena, out"
17812,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of which both have sprung, and in which both forever remain rooted."
17813,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Thus, from the real sun, rising and setting; from the real atmosphere,"
17814,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,calm in its dominion of unfading blue and fierce in its descent of
17815,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,tempest--the Greek forms first the idea of two entirely personal and
17816,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"corporeal gods (Apollo and Athena), whose limbs are clothed in divine"
17817,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"flesh, and whose brows are crowned with divine beauty; yet so real that"
17818,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the quiver rattles at their shoulder, and the chariot bends beneath"
17819,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"their weight. And, on the other hand, collaterally with these corporeal"
17820,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"images, and never for one instant separated from them, he conceives"
17821,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"also two omnipresent spiritual influences, of which one illuminates,"
17822,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"as the sun, with a constant fire, whatever in humanity is skillful and"
17823,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"wise; and the other, like the living air, breathes the calm of heavenly"
17824,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,fortitude and strength of righteous anger into every human breast that
17825,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,is pure and brave.
17826,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17827,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"""Now, therefore, in nearly every [natural] myth of importance, ..."
17828,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,you have to discern these three structural parts--the root and the
17829,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"two branches. The root, in physical existence, sun, or sky, or cloud,"
17830,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"or sea; then the personal incarnation of that, becoming a trusted and"
17831,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"companionable deity, with whom you may walk hand in hand, as a child"
17832,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"with its brother or its sister; and lastly, the moral significance of"
17833,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"the image, which is in all the great myths eternally and beneficently"
17834,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"true."""
17835,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17836,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"What Ruskin calls, above, the historical myth may be the euhemeristic"
17837,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"transformation of real events and personages, as of a flood and those"
17838,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,concerned in it; or it may be the ætiological invention of a story
17839,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"to account for rituals of which the origin has been forgotten, as"
17840,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"of the Dionysiac revels, with their teaching of liberation from the"
17841,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"sordid limits of mortality. In either case, especially the latter,"
17842,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,the imaginative and moral significance of the historical myth has in
17843,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,general developed with the advance of civilization.
17844,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,
17845,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"Myth, in fine, whether natural, historical, or spiritual, ""is not to be"
17846,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"regarded as mere error and folly, but as an interesting product of the"
17847,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"human mind. It is sham history, the fictitious narrative of events that"
17848,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"never happened.""[386] But that is not the full statement of the case."
17849,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,Myth is also actual history of early and imperfect stages of thought
17850,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and belief; it is the true narrative of unenlightened observation,"
17851,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of infantine gropings after truth. Whatever reservations scholars
17852,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"may make on other points, most of them will concur in these: that"
17853,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"some myths came into existence by a ""disease of language""; that some"
17854,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"were invented to explain names of nations and of places, and some to"
17855,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,explain the existence of fossils and bones that suggested prehistoric
17856,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,animals and men; that many were invented to gratify the ancestral pride
17857,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,of chieftains and clans and to justify the existence of religious
17858,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"and tribal ceremonials, and the common cult of departed souls, and"
17859,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,that very many obtained consistency and form as explanations of the
17860,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"phenomena of nature, as expressions of the reverence felt for the"
17861,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,"powers of nature, and as personifications, in general, of the passions"
17862,THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH,and the ideals of primitive mankind.[387]

17920,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,=296. Theories of Resemblance.= Several theories of the appearance of
17921,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"the same explanatory or æsthetic myth under various guises, in lands"
17922,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"remote one from another, have been advanced; but none of them fully"
17923,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,unveils the mystery. The difficulty lies not so much in accounting for
17924,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"the similarity of thought or material in different stories, as for the"
17925,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,resemblance in isolated incidents and in the arrangement of incidents
17926,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,or plot. The principal theories of the distribution of myths are as
17927,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,follows:
17928,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,
17929,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,(1) That the resemblances between the myths of different nations are
17930,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,purely _accidental_. This theory leaves us no wiser than we were.
17931,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,
17932,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,(2) That the stories have been _borrowed_ by one nation from another.
17933,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,This will account for exchange only between nations historically
17934,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,acquainted with each other. It will not account for the existence of
17935,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,the same arrangement of incidents in a Greek myth and in a Polynesian
17936,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,romance.
17937,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,
17938,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"(3) That all myths, if traced chronologically backward and"
17939,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"geographically from land to land, will be found _to have originated_"
17940,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,_in India_.[388] This theory fails to account for numerous stories
17941,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"current among the modern nationalities of Europe, of Africa, and of"
17942,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,India itself. It leaves also unexplained the existence of certain myths
17943,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"in Egypt many centuries before India had any known history: such as, in"
17944,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"all probability, the Egyptian myth of Osiris. The theory, therefore, is"
17945,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,open to the objection made to the theory of borrowing.
17946,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,
17947,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,(4) That similar myths are based upon _historical traditions_ similar
17948,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"in various countries or inherited from some mother country. But,"
17949,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"although some historical myths may have descended from a mother race,"
17950,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"it has already been demonstrated (§ 294, (1)) that the historical"
17951,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"(euhemeristic) hypothesis is inadequate. It is, moreover, not likely"
17952,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"that many historical incidents, like those related in the Iliad and"
17953,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"the Odyssey, happened in the same order and as actual history in Asia"
17954,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"Minor, Ithaca, Persia, and Norway. But we find myths containing such"
17955,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,incidents in all these countries.[389]
17956,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,
17957,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"(5) That the Aryan tribes (from which the Indians, Persians, Phrygians,"
17958,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"Greeks, Romans, Germans, Norsemen, Russians, and Celts are descended)"
17959,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"""started from a common center"" in the highlands of Northern India, ""and"
17960,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"that from their ancient home they must have carried away, if not the"
17961,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"developed myth, yet the quickening germ from which might spring leaves"
17962,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"and fruits, varying in form and hue according to the soil to which"
17963,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,it should be committed and the climate under which the plant might
17964,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"reach maturity.""[390] Against this theory it may be urged that stories"
17965,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"having only the undeveloped germ or idea in common would not, with"
17966,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"any probability, after they had been developed independently of each"
17967,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"other, possess the remarkable resemblance in details that many widely"
17968,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"separated myths display. Moreover, the assumption of this common stock"
17969,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"considers only Aryan tribes: it ignores Africans, Mongolians, American"
17970,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"Indians, and other peoples whose myths resemble the Aryan, but are"
17971,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"not traceable to the same original germ. The _Aryan germ-theory_ has,"
17972,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"however, the merit of explaining resemblances between many myths of"
17973,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,different Aryan nations.
17974,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,
17975,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,(6) That the existence of similar incidents or situations is to
17976,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"be explained as resulting from the common facts of human thought,"
17977,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"experience, and sentiment. This may be called the _psychological_"
17978,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"_theory_. It was entertained by Grimm, and goes hand in hand with the"
17979,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"anthropological, or ""survivalist,"" explanation of the elements of"
17980,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"myth. ""In the long history of mankind,"" says Mr. Andrew Lang, ""it is"
17981,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,impossible to deny that stories may conceivably have spread from a
17982,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"single center, and been handed on from races like the Indo-European and"
17983,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"Semitic to races as far removed from them in every way as the Zulus,"
17984,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,"the Australians, the Eskimos, the natives of the South Sea Islands."
17985,THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS,But while the possibility of the diffusion of myths by borrowing and

18037,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"were preserved in popular traditions, in the sacred ceremonials"
18038,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of colleges of priests, in the narratives chanted by families of"
18039,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,minstrels or by professional bards wandering from village to village
18040,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"or from court to court, and in occasional hymns sung by privileged"
18041,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"harpists, like Demodocus of Phæacia,[393] in honor of a chieftain, an"
18042,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"ancestor, or a god. Many of these early bards are mere names to us."
18043,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Most of them are probably as mythical as the songs with which they are
18044,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"accredited. The following is a brief account of mythical prophets, of"
18045,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"mythical musicians and poets, and of the actual poets and historians"
18046,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,who recorded the mythologies from which English literature draws its
18047,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"classical myths,--the Greek, the Roman, the Norse, and the German."
18048,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18049,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,=298. In Greece.= (1) _Mythical Prophets._ To some of the oldest bards
18050,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"was attributed the gift of prophecy. Indeed, nearly every expedition of"
18051,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"mythology was accompanied by one of these seers, priests, or ""medicine"
18052,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"men,"" as we might call them."
18053,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18054,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,_Melampus_ was the first Greek said to be endowed with prophetic
18055,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,powers. Before his house there stood an oak tree containing a serpent's
18056,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"nest. The old serpents were killed by the slaves, but Melampus saved"
18057,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the young ones. One day when he was asleep under the oak, the serpents"
18058,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"licked his ears with their tongues, enabling him to understand the"
18059,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,language of birds and creeping things.[394] At one time his enemies
18060,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"seized and imprisoned him. But Melampus, in the silence of the night,"
18061,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,heard from the woodworms in the timbers that the supports of the house
18062,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,were nearly eaten through and the roof would soon fall in. He told
18063,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"his captors. They took his warning, escaped destruction, rewarded the"
18064,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"prophet, and held him in high honor."
18065,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18066,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Other famous soothsayers were Amphiaraüs, who took part in the War"
18067,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of the Seven against Thebes; Calchas, who accompanied the Greeks"
18068,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"during the Trojan War; Helenus and Cassandra, of King Priam's family,"
18069,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"who prophesied for the Trojan forces; Tiresias, the blind prophet of"
18070,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Thebes; and Mopsus, who attended the Argonauts. The stories of these"
18071,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,expeditions are given in preceding chapters.
18072,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18073,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,(2) _Mythical Musicians and Poets._ Since the poets of antiquity sang
18074,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,their stories or hymns to an accompaniment of their own upon the harp
18075,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"or lyre, they were skilled in the art of music as well as in that of"
18076,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,verse.
18077,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18078,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"_Orpheus_, whose adventures have been narrated, passes in tradition for"
18079,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the oldest of Greek lyrists, and the special favorite, even the son,"
18080,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of the god Apollo, patron of musicians. This Thracian bard is said to"
18081,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,have taught mysterious truths concerning the origin of things and the
18082,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,immortality of the soul. But the fragments of Orphic hymns which are
18083,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,attributed to him are probably the work of philosophers of a much later
18084,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,period in Greek literature.
18085,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18086,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Another Thracian bard, _Thamyris_, is said in his presumption to have"
18087,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"challenged the Muses to a trial of skill. Conquered in the contest,"
18088,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"he was deprived of his sight. To _Musæus_, the son of Orpheus, was"
18089,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"attributed a hymn on the Eleusinian mysteries, and other sacred poems"
18090,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,and oracles. Milton couples his name with that of Orpheus:
18091,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18092,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"But, O sad Virgin! that thy power"
18093,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Might raise Musæus from his bower,"

18102,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,and Odyssey we have taken the chief part of our chapters on the Trojan
18103,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"War and the return of the Grecians, is almost as mythical a personage"
18104,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,as the heroes he celebrates. The traditionary story is that he was a
18105,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"wandering minstrel, blind and old, who traveled from place to place"
18106,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"singing his lays to the music of his harp, in the courts of princes or"

18108,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"his hearers. Byron calls him ""the blind old man of Scio's rocky isle"";"

18117,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18118,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Modern scholars have doubted whether the Homeric poems are the work of
18119,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"any single mind. This uncertainty arises, in part, from the difficulty"
18120,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,of believing that poems of such length could have been committed to
18121,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"writing in the age usually assigned to these, when materials capable of"
18122,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"transmitting long productions were not yet in use. On the other hand,"
18123,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,it is asked how poems of such length could have been handed down from
18124,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,age to age by means of the memory alone. This question is answered by
18125,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the statement that there was a professional body of men whose business
18126,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,it was to commit to memory and rehearse for pay the national and
18127,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,patriotic legends.
18128,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18129,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Pisistratus of Athens ordered a commission of scholars (about 537 B.C.)
18130,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,to collect and revise the Homeric poems; and it is probable that at
18131,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"that time certain passages of the Iliad and Odyssey, as we now have"
18132,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"them, were interpolated. Beside the Iliad and the Odyssey, many other"
18133,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,epics passed in antiquity under Homer's name. The so-called Homeric
18134,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Hymns to the gods, which were composed by various poets after the"
18135,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"death of Homer, are a source of valuable information concerning the"
18136,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,attributes of the divinities addressed.
18137,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18138,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"The date assigned to Homer, on the authority of Herodotus, is 850 B.C."
18139,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"The preservation and further fashioning of myths fell, after Homer's"
18140,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"time, into the hands of the Rhapsodists, who chanted epic songs, and"
18141,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of the Cyclic poets, who elaborated into various epic _circles_, or"
18142,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"completed wholes, neglected traditions of the Trojan War. Among these"
18143,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"cyclic poems were the Cyprian Lays, which related the beginnings of"
18144,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the Trojan War and the first nine years of the siege, thus leading up"
18145,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"to the Iliad; the Æthiopis, which continued the Iliad and told of the"
18146,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"death of Achilles; the Little Iliad and the Iliupersis, which narrated"
18147,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the fall of Troy and magnified the exploits of Ajax and Philoctetes;
18148,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"and the Nostoi, or Home-Comings, which told the adventures of various"
18149,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Greek heroes during the period of ten years between the end of the
18150,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Iliad and the beginning of the Odyssey. Most of these poems were once
18151,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"attributed to Homer. They are all lost, but the names of some of their"
18152,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,authors survive. There was also a cycle which told of the two wars
18153,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,against Thebes.
18154,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18155,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"_Hesiod_ is, like Homer, one of the most important sources of our"
18156,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,knowledge of Greek mythology. He is thought by some to have been a
18157,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"contemporary of Homer, but concerning the relative dates of the two"
18158,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,poets there is no certainty. Hesiod was born in Ascra in B[oe]otia;
18159,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"he spent his youth as a shepherd on Mount Helicon, his manhood in the"
18160,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"neighborhood of Corinth, and wrote two great poems, the Works and"
18161,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Days, and the Theogony, or Genealogy of the Gods. From the former we"
18162,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,obtain a connected account of Greek traditions concerning the primitive
18163,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"commodities of life, the arts of agriculture and navigation, the sacred"
18164,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"calendar, and the various prehistoric ages. From the latter poem we"
18165,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"learn the Greek mythology of the creation of the world, the family of"
18166,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the gods, their wars, and their attitude toward primeval man. While"
18167,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Hesiod may have composed his works at a somewhat later period than
18168,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Homer, it is noteworthy that his stories of the gods have more of the"
18169,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"savage or senseless element than those attributed to Homer. The artist,"
18170,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"or artists, of the Iliad and the Odyssey seem to have refined the"
18171,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"stories into poetic gold; Hesiod has gathered them in the ore, like so"
18172,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,many specimens for a museum.
18173,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18174,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"A company of _Lyric Poets_, of whom Stesichorus (620 B.C.), Alcæus"
18175,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"(611 B.C.), Sappho (610 B.C.), Arion (600 B.C.), Simonides of Ceos"
18176,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"(556 B.C.), Ibycus (540 B.C.), Anacreon (530 B.C.), and Pindar (522"
18177,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"B.C.) are the most prominent, have contributed much to our knowledge of"
18178,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"mythology. They have left us hymns to the gods, references to mythical"
18179,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"heroes, and accounts of more or less pathetic legendary adventures."
18180,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18181,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Of the works of _Sappho_ few fragments remain, but they establish her"
18182,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,claim to eminent poetical genius. Her story is frequently alluded
18183,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"to. Being passionately in love with a beautiful youth named Phaon,"
18184,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"and failing to obtain a return of affection, she is said to have"
18185,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"thrown herself from the promontory of Leucadia into the sea, under a"
18186,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"superstition that those who should take that ""Lover's Leap"" would, if"
18187,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"not destroyed, be cured of their love."
18188,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18189,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Of _Arion_ the greatest work was a dithyramb or choral hymn to the god
18190,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,of wine. It is said that his music and song were of such sweetness as
18191,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,to charm the monsters of the sea; and that when thrown overboard on
18192,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"one occasion by avaricious seamen, he was borne safely to land by an"
18193,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"admiring dolphin. Spenser represents Arion, mounted on his dolphin,"
18194,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,accompanying the train of Neptune and Amphitrite:
18195,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18196,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Then was there heard a most celestial sound
18197,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Of dainty music, which did next ensue"
18198,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Before the spouse: that was Arion crowned
18199,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Who, playing on his harp, unto him drew"
18200,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,The ears and hearts of all that goodly crew;
18201,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,That even yet the dolphin which him bore
18202,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Through the Ægean seas from pirates' view,"
18203,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Stood still by him astonished at his lore,"
18204,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,And all the raging seas for joy forgot to roar.[396]
18205,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18206,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"_Simonides_ was one of the most prolific of the early poets of Greece,"
18207,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,but only a few fragments of his compositions have descended to us.
18208,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"He wrote hymns, triumphal odes, and elegies, and in the last species"
18209,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,of composition he particularly excelled. His genius was inclined to
18210,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the pathetic; none could touch with truer effect the chords of human
18211,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"sympathy. The Lamentation of Danaë, the most important of the fragments"
18212,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"which remain of his poetry, is based upon the tradition that Danaë and"
18213,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,her infant son were confined by order of her father Acrisius in a chest
18214,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"and set adrift on the sea. The myth of her son, Perseus, has already"
18215,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,been narrated.
18216,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18217,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Myths received their freest and perhaps most ideal treatment at the
18218,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"hands of the greatest lyric poet of Greece, _Pindar_ (522 B.C.). In his"
18219,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,hymns and songs of praise to gods and in his odes composed for the
18220,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"victors in the national athletic contests, he was accustomed to use the"
18221,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,mythical exploits of Greek heroes as a text from which to draw morals
18222,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,appropriate to the occasion.[397]
18223,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18224,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,The three great _Tragic Poets_ of Greece have handed down to us a
18225,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,wealth of mythological material. From the plays of _Æschylus_ (525
18226,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"B.C.) we gather, among other noble lessons, the fortunes of the"
18227,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"family of Agamemnon, the narrative of the expedition against Thebes,"
18228,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the sufferings of Prometheus, benefactor of men. In the tragedies of"
18229,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,_Sophocles_ (495 B.C.) we have a further account of the family of
18230,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Agamemnon, myths of [OE]dipus of Thebes and his children, stories"
18231,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"connected with the Trojan War, and the last adventure and the death of"
18232,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Hercules. Of the dramas of _Euripides_ (480 B.C.) there remain to us
18233,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"seventeen, in which are found stories of the daughters of Agamemnon,"
18234,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the rare and beautiful narrative of Alcestis, and the adventures of"
18235,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Medea. All of these stories have been recounted in their proper places.
18236,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18237,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"The _Comedies of Aristophanes_, also, are replete with matters of"
18238,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,mythological import.
18239,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18240,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Of the later poets of mythology, only two need be mentioned"
18241,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"here,--_Apollonius_ of Rhodes (194 B.C.), who wrote in frigid style"
18242,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the story of Jason's Voyage for the Golden Fleece; and _Theocritus_ of
18243,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Sicily (270 B.C.), whose rural idyls are at once charmingly natural and"
18244,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,romantic.[398]

18246,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,(4) _Historians of Mythology._ The earliest narrators in prose of
18247,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the myths, legends and genealogies of Greece lived about 600 B.C."
18248,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Herodotus, the ""father of history"" (484 B.C.), embalms various myths"
18249,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,in his account of the conflicts between Asia and Greece. Apollodorus
18250,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,(140 B.C.) gathers the legends of Greece later incorporated in the
18251,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Library of Greek Mythology. That delightful traveler, Pausanias, makes"
18252,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"special mention, in his Tour of Greece, of the sacred customs and"
18253,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,legends that had maintained themselves as late as his time (160 A.D.).
18254,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Lucian, in his Dialogues of the Gods and Dialogues of the Dead, awakens"
18255,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"""inextinguishable laughter"" by his satire on ancient faith and fable."

18257,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"=299. Roman Poets of Mythology.= _Virgil_, called also by his surname,"
18258,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Maro, from whose poem of the Æneid we have taken the story of Æneas,"
18259,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"was one of the great poets who made the age of the Roman emperor,"
18260,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Augustus, celebrated. Virgil was born in Mantua in the year 70 B.C."
18261,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"His great poem is ranked next to those of Homer, in that noble class"
18262,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of poetical composition, the epic. Virgil is inferior to Homer in"
18263,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"originality and invention. The Æneid, written in an age of culture and"
18264,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"science, lacks that charming atmosphere of belief which invests the"
18265,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"naïve, or _popular_, epic. The myths concerning the founding of Rome,"
18266,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"which Virgil has received from earlier writers, he has here fused"
18267,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"into a _literary_ epic. But what the Æneid lacks of epic simplicity,"
18268,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"it makes up in patriotic spirit, in lofty moral and civic ideals, in"
18269,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"correctness of taste, and in stylistic form."
18270,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18271,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"_Ovid_, often alluded to in poetry by his other name, Naso, was born"
18272,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,in the year 43 B.C. He was educated for public life and held some
18273,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"offices of considerable dignity; but poetry was his delight, and he"
18274,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,early resolved to cultivate it. He accordingly sought the society of
18275,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"contemporary poets and was acquainted with Horace and saw Virgil,"
18276,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,though the latter died when Ovid was yet too young and undistinguished
18277,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,to have formed his acquaintance. Ovid spent an easy life at Rome
18278,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,in the enjoyment of a competent income. He was intimate with the
18279,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"family of Augustus, the emperor; and it is supposed that some serious"
18280,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,offense given to a member of that family was the cause of an event
18281,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,which reversed the poet's happy circumstances and clouded the latter
18282,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,portion of his life. At the age of fifty he was banished from Rome
18283,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,and ordered to betake himself to Tomi on the borders of the Black
18284,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Sea. His only consolation in exile was to address his wife and absent
18285,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"friends. His letters were all in verse. They are called the ""Tristia,"""
18286,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"or Sorrows, and Letters from Pontus. The two great works of Ovid are"
18287,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"his ""Metamorphoses"" or Transformations, and his ""Fasti,"" or Poetic"
18288,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Calendar. They are both mythological poems, and from the former we have"
18289,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,taken many of our stories of Grecian and Roman mythology. These poems
18290,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,have thus been characterized:
18291,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18292,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"""The rich mythology of Greece furnished Ovid, as it may still furnish"
18293,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the poet, the painter, and the sculptor, with materials for his art."
18294,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"With exquisite taste, simplicity, and pathos he has narrated the"
18295,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"fabulous traditions of early ages, and given to them that appearance of"
18296,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,reality which only a master hand could impart. His pictures of nature
18297,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,are striking and true; he selects with care that which is appropriate;
18298,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"he rejects the superfluous, and when he has completed his work, it is"
18299,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,neither defective nor redundant. The 'Metamorphoses' are read with
18300,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"pleasure by the young and old of every civilized land."""
18301,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18302,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"In an incidental manner, _Horace_, the prince of Roman lyric poets,"
18303,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"and the lyric and elegiac writers, _Catullus_, _Tibullus_, and"
18304,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"_Propertius_, have liberally increased our knowledge of Greek and Roman"
18305,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,myth.[399]
18306,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18307,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"_Seneca_, the teacher of Nero, is best known for his philosophical"
18308,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"treatises; but he wrote, also, tragedies, the materials of which"
18309,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"are well-known Greek legends. _Apuleius_, born in Africa, 114 A.D.,"
18310,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"interests us as the compiler of a clever romance, The Golden Ass;[400]"
18311,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the most pleasing episode of which, the story of Cupid and Psyche, has"
18312,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,been elsewhere related.[401]
18313,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18314,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,=300. Records of Norse Mythology.=[402] A system of mythology of
18315,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"especial interest,--as belonging to the race from which we, through"
18316,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"our English ancestors, derive our origin,--is that of the Norsemen,"
18317,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"who inhabited the countries now known as Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and"
18318,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Iceland. Their mythological lore has been transmitted by means of
18319,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Runes, Skaldic poems, the Eddas, and the Sagas."
18320,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18321,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,_The Runes._ The earliest method of writing prevalent among the
18322,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Norsemen was by runes. The word means _hidden lore_, or _mystery_."
18323,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,The earliest runes were merely fanciful signs supposed to possess
18324,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"mysterious power. As a synonym for _writing_, the term was first"
18325,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"applied to the Northern alphabet, itself derived from ancient Greek"
18326,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,and Roman coins. Of the old Scandinavian runes several specimens have
18327,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,been found--one an inscription on a golden horn of the third or fourth
18328,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"century A.D., which was dug up in Schleswig a hundred and sixty years"
18329,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"ago; another, on a stone at Tune in Norway. From such an alphabet the"
18330,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Anglo-Saxon runes were derived. Inscriptions in later Scandinavian
18331,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"runes have been discovered in Sweden, Denmark, and the Isle of Man."
18332,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,The characters are of the stiff and angular form necessitated by the
18333,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"materials on which they were inscribed,--tombstones, spoons, chairs,"
18334,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"oars, and so forth.[403] It is doubtful whether mythological poems were"
18335,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"ever written in this way; dedications to pagan deities, ditties of the"
18336,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"eleventh century, and love-spells have, however, been found."
18337,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18338,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,_The Skaldic Poems._ The bards and poets of the Norsemen were the
18339,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Skalds. They were the depositaries of whatever historic lore there
18340,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,was; and it was their office to mingle something of intellectual
18341,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"gratification with the rude feasts of the warriors, by rehearsing,"
18342,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,with such accompaniments of poetry and music as their skill could
18343,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"afford, the exploits of heroes living or dead. Such songs were called"
18344,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Drapas. The origin of Skaldic poetry is lost in mythic or prehistoric
18345,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"darkness, but the Skalds of Iceland continued to play a most important"
18346,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,part in the literary development of the north as late as the end of the
18347,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"fourteenth century. Without their coöperation, the greater part of the"
18348,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,songs and sagas of genuine antiquity could hardly have reached us. The
18349,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Skaldic diction, which was polished to an artistic extreme, with its"
18350,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,pagan metaphors and similes retained its supremacy over literary form
18351,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,even after the influence of Christianity had revolutionized national
18352,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,thought.[404]
18353,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18354,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,_The Eddas._ The chief mythological records of the Norse are the Eddas
18355,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,and the Sagas. The word _Edda_ has usually been connected with the
18356,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Icelandic for _great-grandmother_;[405] it has also been regarded
18357,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"as a corruption of the High German _Erda_, Mother Earth, from whom,"
18358,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"according to the lay in which the word first occurs, the earliest"
18359,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"race of mankind sprang,[406]--or as the _point_ or _head_ of Norse"
18360,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"poetry,[407] or as a tale concerned with _death_,[408] or as derived"
18361,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"from Odde, the home of the reputed collector of the Elder Edda. But,"
18362,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of recent years, scholars have looked with most favor upon a derivation"
18363,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"from the Icelandic _óðr_, which means mind, or poetry.[409] There are"
18364,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,two Icelandic collections called Eddas: Snorri's and Sæmund's. Until
18365,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the year 1643 the name was applied to a book, principally in prose,"
18366,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"containing Mythical Tales, a Treatise on the Poetic Art and Diction, a"
18367,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Poem on Meters, and a Rhymed Glossary of Synonyms, with an appendix of"
18368,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,minor treatises on grammar and rhetoric--the whole intended as a guide
18369,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"for poets. Although a note in the Upsala manuscript, of date about 1300"
18370,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"A.D., asserted that this work was ""put together"" by Snorri Sturlason,"
18371,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"who lived 1178-1241, the world was not informed of the fact until 1609,"
18372,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,when Arngrim Johnsson made the announcement in his Constitutional
18373,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,History of Iceland.[410] While the main treatises on the poetic art
18374,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"are, in general, Snorri's, the treatises on grammar and rhetoric have"
18375,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"been, with more or less certitude, assigned to other writers of the"
18376,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It is probable, too, that in the"
18377,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Mythical Tales, or the Delusion of Gylfi, Snorri merely enlarged and"
18378,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,edited with poetical illustrations the work of earlier hands. The poets
18379,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries do not speak of Snorri, but"
18380,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"they refer continually to the ""rules of Edda,"" and frequently to the"
18381,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"obscurity and the conventionality of Eddic phraseology, figures, and"
18382,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,art. Even at the present day in Iceland it is common to hear the term
18383,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"""void of Eddic art,"" or ""a bungler in Eddic art."" A rearrangement of"
18384,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Snorri's Edda, by Magnus Olafsson (1574-1636), is much better known"
18385,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,than the original work.
18386,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18387,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"In 1642, Bishop Bryniolf Sveinsson discovered a manuscript of the"
18388,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,mythological poems of Iceland. Misled by theories of his own and
18389,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"by a fanciful suggestion of the famous antiquary Biorn of Scardsa,"
18390,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"he attributed the composition of these poems to Sæmund the Wise, a"
18391,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"historian who lived 1056-1133. Henceforth, consequently, Snorri's"
18392,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"work is called the Younger, or Prose Edda, in contradistinction to"
18393,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Bryniolf's find, which is known as the Elder, the Poetical Edda, or the"
18394,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Edda of Sæmund. The oldest manuscript of the Poetical Edda is of the
18395,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,thirteenth century. Its contents were probably collected not later
18396,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,than 1150. The composition of the poems cannot well be placed earlier
18397,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,than the ninth or tenth centuries after Christ; and a consideration
18398,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of the habits, laws, geography, and vocabulary illustrated by the"
18399,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,poems leads eminent scholars to assign the authorship to emigrants
18400,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of the south Norwegian tribes who, sailing westward, ""won Waterford"
18401,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"and Limerick, and kinged it in York and East England.""[411] The poems"
18402,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"are Icelandic, however, in their general character and history. They"
18403,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,are principally of heroic and mythical import: such as the stories of
18404,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Balder's Fate, of Skirnir's Journey, of Thor's Hammer, of Helgi the"
18405,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Hunding's Bane, and the twenty lays that in fragmentary fashion tell"
18406,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the eventful history of the Volsungs and the Nibelungs.[412]
18407,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18408,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,_The Sagas._ The Eddas contain many myths and mythical features that
18409,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"contradict the national character of both Germans and Norsemen, but"
18410,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the sagas have their roots in Norse civilization and are national
18411,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,property.[413] Of these mythic-heroic prose compositions the most
18412,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"important to us is the Volsunga Saga, which was put together probably"
18413,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,in the twelfth century and is based in part upon the poems of the Elder
18414,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Edda, in part upon floating traditions, and in part upon popular songs"
18415,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,that now are lost.[414]
18416,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18417,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,=301. Records of German Mythology.=[412] The story of the Volsungs
18418,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,and the Nibelungs springs from mythological sources common to the
18419,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"whole Teutonic race. Two distinct versions of the saga survive,--the"
18420,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Low or North German, which we have already noticed in the lays of"
18421,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the Elder Edda and in the Norse Volsunga Saga, and the High or South"
18422,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"German, which has been preserved in German folk songs and in the"
18423,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Nibelungenlied, or Lay of the Nibelungs, that has grown out of them."
18424,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"The Norse form of the story exhibits a later survival of the credulous,"
18425,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"or myth-making, mental condition. The Lay of the Nibelungs absorbed, at"
18426,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"an earlier date, historical elements, and began sooner to restrict the"
18427,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,personality of its heroes within the compass of human limitations.[415]
18428,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18429,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Although there are many manuscripts, or fragments of manuscripts, of"
18430,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the Nibelungenlied that attest its popularity between the thirteenth
18431,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"and sixteenth centuries, it was not until the Swiss critic, J. J."
18432,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Bodmer, published, in 1757, portions of two ancient poems, ""The"
18433,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Revenge of Kriemhild"" and ""The Lament over the Heroes of Etzel,"""
18434,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,that the attention of modern scholars was called to this famous
18435,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,German epic. Since that time many theories of the composition of the
18436,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Nibelungenlied have been advanced. It has been held by some that the
18437,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"German epic is an adaptation of the Norse version;[416] by others,"
18438,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"that the Scandinavians, not the Germans, borrowed the story; and by"
18439,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"others still, that the epics, while proceeding from a common cradle,"
18440,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,are of independent growth. The last theory is the most tenable.[417]
18441,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Concerning the history of the Nibelungenlied, it has been maintained"
18442,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"that since, during the twelfth century, when no poet would adopt"
18443,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"any other poet's stanzaic form, the Austrian Von Kürenberg used the"
18444,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"stanzaic form of the Nibelungenlied, the epic must be his.[418] It"
18445,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"has also been urged that the poem, having been written down about"
18446,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"1140, was altered in metrical form by younger poets, until, in 1200 or"
18447,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"thereabouts, it assumed the form preserved in the latest of the three"
18448,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,great manuscripts.[419] But the theory advanced by Lachmann is still
18449,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,of great value: that the poem consists of a number of ancient ballads
18450,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of various age and uneven worth; and that, about 1210, a collector,"
18451,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"mending some of the ballads to suit himself, strung them together on a"
18452,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,thread of his own invention.
18453,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18454,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"In fine, the materials of the poem would persuade us not only of"
18455,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"its origin in very ancient popular lays, but of their fusion and"
18456,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"improvement by the imaginative effort of at least one, and probably"
18457,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"of several poets, who lived and wrote between 1120 and 1200 A.D. The"
18458,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"metrical structure, also, would indicate derivation from the German"
18459,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,folk song and modification due to multifarious handling on the part of
18460,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,popular minstrels and poets of written verse.[420]

18462,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,=302. Records of Oriental Mythology: Egyptian.=[421] Although
18463,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the myths of Egypt, India, and Persia are of intense interest and"
18464,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"importance, they have not materially affected English literature. The"
18465,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"following is, however, a brief outline of the means by which some of"
18466,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,them have been preserved.
18467,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18468,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"The Egyptian records are (1) _The Hieroglyphs_, or sacred inscriptions"
18469,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"in Tombs of the Kings, and other solemn places,--conveying ideas by"
18470,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"symbols, by phonetic signs, or by both; (2) _The Sacred Papyri_,"
18471,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,containing hymns to the gods; (3) _The_ _Books of the Dead_ and of the
18472,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"_Lower Hemisphere_,--devoted to necromantic incantations, prayers for"
18473,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the souls of the departed, and other rituals."
18474,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18475,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"=303. Indian Records.= (1) _The Vedas_, or Holy Scriptures of the"
18476,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Hindus, which fall into four divisions. The most ancient, the Rig-Veda,"
18477,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,consists of hymns of an elevated and spiritual character composed by
18478,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"families of Rishis, or psalmists, as far back, perhaps, as 3000 B.C.,"
18479,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,not later than 1400 B.C. They give us the religious conceptions of
18480,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,the Aryans when they crossed the Himalayas and began to push toward
18481,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,Southern Hindustan. The Sama-Veda is a book of solemn chants and
18482,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"tunes. The Yajur-Veda comprises prayers for sacrificial occasions,"
18483,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"and interpretations of the same. The Atharva-Veda shows, as might be"
18484,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"expected of the youngest of the series, the influence upon the purer"
18485,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Aryan creed of superstitions borrowed, perhaps, from the aboriginal"
18486,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,tribes of India. It contains spells for exorcising demons and placating
18487,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,them.
18488,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,
18489,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,(2) _The Indian Epics_ of classical standing. They are the Mahâbhârata
18490,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,and the Râmâyana. Scholars differ as to the chronological precedence.
18491,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,The Great Feud of the Bhâratas has the air of superior antiquity
18492,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,because of the numerous hands and generations that have contributed
18493,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"to its composition. The Adventures of Râma, on the other hand,"
18494,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,recalls a more primitive stage of credulity and of savage invention.
18495,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,The Mahâbhârata is a storehouse of mythical tradition. It contains
18496,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"several well-rounded epic poems, the most beautiful of which is the"
18497,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Episode of Nala,--a prince who, succumbing to a weakness common to"
18498,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"his contemporaries, has gambled away his kingdom. The Great Feud of"
18499,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the Bhâratas is, indeed, assigned to an author--but his name, Vyâsa,"
18500,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,means simply the Arranger. The Râmâyana purports to have been written
18501,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"by the poet Vâlmîki. It tells how Sita, the wife of Prince Râma, is"
18502,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"carried off to Ceylon by Râvana, king of the demons, and how Râma, by"
18503,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"the aid of an army of monkeys, bridges the straits between India and"
18504,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Ceylon and, slaying the demon, recovers his lovely and innocent wife."
18505,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,The resemblance between the plot and that of the Iliad has inclined
18506,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"some scholars to derive the Indian from the Greek epic. But, until the"
18507,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"relative antiquity of the poems is established, the Iliad might as well"
18508,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,be derived from the Râmâyana. The theory is unsubstantiated. These
18509,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,epics of India lack the artistic spirit and grace of the Iliad and the
18510,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Odyssey, but they display a keener sympathy with nature and a more"
18511,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,romantic appreciation of the loves and sorrows of mankind.

18516,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"Zoroaster and his contemporaries, and scriptures of as recent a date"
18517,THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS,"as the fifth century B.C. Zoroaster, a holy man of God, was the"

19992,TABLE C. DIVINITIES OF THE SEA,"a bear in a certain constellation, they might naturally mix the fables"
19993,TABLE C. DIVINITIES OF THE SEA,"and combine them later with the legend of the all-powerful Zeus (Lang,"
19994,TABLE C. DIVINITIES OF THE SEA,"2, 181). According to another account, Callisto was punished for her"
19995,TABLE C. DIVINITIES OF THE SEA,love of Jupiter by Diana (Artemis). Her name has been identified with
19996,TABLE C. DIVINITIES OF THE SEA,"the adjective _Calliste_, 'most fair,' which was certainly applied to"
19997,TABLE C. DIVINITIES OF THE SEA,Artemis herself. That Artemis was protectress of she-bears is known;
19998,TABLE C. DIVINITIES OF THE SEA,"also that, in Attica, she was served by girls who imitated, while"

22249,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,=_Interpretative._= All myths of the sun represent that luminary
22250,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"as struggling against and overcoming monsters, or performing other"
22251,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,laborious tasks in obedience to the orders of some tyrant of inferior
22252,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"spirit, but of legal authority. Since the life of Hercules is composed"
22253,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"of such tasks, it is easy to class him with other sun-heroes. But to"
22254,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,construe his whole history and all his feats as symbolic of the sun's
22255,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"progress through the heavens, beginning with the labors performed"
22256,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,in his eastern home and ending with the capture of Cerberus in the
22257,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"underworld beyond the west, or to construe the subjects of the twelve"
22258,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,labors as consciously recalling the twelve signs of the Zodiac is not
22259,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"only unwarranted, but absurd. To some extent Hercules is a sun-hero; to"
22260,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,some extent his adventures are fabulous history; to a greater extent
22261,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"both he and his adventures are the product of generations of æsthetic,"
22262,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"but primitive and fanciful, invention. The same statement holds true"
22263,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,of nearly all the heroes and heroic deeds of mythology. As a matter of
22264,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"interest, it may be noted that the serpents that attacked Hercules in"
22265,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"his cradle are explained as powers of darkness which the sun destroys,"
22266,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"and the cattle that he tended, as the clouds of morning. His choice"
22267,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"between pleasure and duty at the outset of his career enforces, of"
22268,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"course, a lesson of conduct. His lion's skin may denote the tawny"
22269,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,cloud which the sun trails behind him as he fights his way through the
22270,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,vapors that he overcomes (Cox). The slaughter of the Centaurs may be
22271,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,the dissipation of these vapors. His insanity may denote the raging
22272,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,heat of the sun at noonday. The Nemean lion may be a monster of cloud
22273,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"or darkness; the Hydra, a cloud that confines the kindly rains, or at"
22274,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,times covers the heavens with numerous necks and heads of vapor. The
22275,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,Cerynean Stag may be a golden-tinted cloud that the sun chases; and the
22276,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"Cattle of the Augean stables, clouds that, refusing to burst in rain,"
22277,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,consign the earth to drought and filth. The Erymanthian boar and the
22278,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,Cretan bull are probably varied forms of the powers of darkness; so
22279,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"also the Stamphalian (Stymphalian) birds and the giant Cacus. Finally,"
22280,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"the scene of the hero's death is a ""picture of a sunset in wild"
22281,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"confusion, the multitude of clouds hurrying hither and thither, now"

22283,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"and other interpreters of myth, would explain the series. But while"
22284,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,"the explanations are entertaining and poetic, their very plausibility"
22285,TABLE J. THE HOUSE OF DANAÜS,should suggest caution in accepting them. It is not safe to construe

22591,TABLE M,=Theseus= is said to have united the several tribes of Attica into
22592,TABLE M,"one state, of which Athens was the capital. In commemoration of this"
22593,TABLE M,"important event, he instituted the festival of =Panathenæa=, in honor"
22594,TABLE M,"of Athene, the patron deity of Athens. This festival differed from the"
22595,TABLE M,other Grecian games chiefly in two particulars. It was peculiar to the
22596,TABLE M,"Athenians, and its chief feature was a solemn procession in which the"
22597,TABLE M,"Peplus, or sacred robe of Athene, was carried to the Parthenon, and"
22598,TABLE M,left on or before the statue of the goddess. The Peplus was covered
22599,TABLE M,"with embroidery, worked by select virgins of the noblest families"
22600,TABLE M,in Athens. The procession consisted of persons of all ages and both
22601,TABLE M,"sexes. The old men carried olive branches in their hands, and the"
22602,TABLE M,"young men bore arms. The young women carried baskets on their heads,"
22603,TABLE M,"containing the sacred utensils, cakes, and all things necessary for the"
22604,TABLE M,sacrifices. The procession formed the subject of the bas-reliefs which
22605,TABLE M,embellished the frieze of the temple of the Parthenon. A considerable
22606,TABLE M,portion of these sculptures is now in the British Museum among those
22607,TABLE M,"known as the ""Elgin Marbles."" We may mention here the other celebrated"
22608,TABLE M,national games of the Greeks. The first and most distinguished were
22609,TABLE M,"the =Olympic=, founded, it was said, by Zeus himself. They were"
22610,TABLE M,celebrated at Olympia in Elis. Vast numbers of spectators flocked to
22611,TABLE M,"them from every part of Greece, and from Asia, Africa, and Sicily."
22612,TABLE M,"They were repeated every fifth year in midsummer, and continued five"
22613,TABLE M,days. They gave rise to the custom of reckoning time and dating
22614,TABLE M,events by Olympiads. The first Olympiad is generally considered as
22615,TABLE M,beginning with the year 776 B.C. The =Pythian= games were celebrated
22616,TABLE M,"in the vicinity of Delphi, the =Isthmian= on the Corinthian isthmus,"
22617,TABLE M,"the =Nemean= at Nemea, a city of Argolis. The exercises in these"
22618,TABLE M,"games were chariot-racing, running, leaping, wrestling, throwing the"
22619,TABLE M,"quoit, hurling the javelin, and boxing. Besides these exercises of"
22620,TABLE M,"bodily strength and agility, there were contests in music, poetry, and"
22621,TABLE M,"eloquence. Thus these games furnished poets, musicians, and authors the"
22622,TABLE M,"best opportunities to present their productions to the public, and the"
22623,TABLE M,fame of the victors was diffused far and wide.

22628,TABLE M,"His story may, with the usual perilous facility, be explained as a"

22632,TABLE M,"Theseus fights with the =Amazons= (clouds, we may suppose, in some form"

22637,TABLE M,"Crete, who, in process of time, like Medea, sank to the condition of a"
22638,TABLE M,heroine. Probably from her goddess-existence the marriage with Bacchus
22639,TABLE M,"survived, to be incorporated later with the Attic myth of Theseus. As"
22640,TABLE M,"the female semblance of Bacchus, she appears to have been a promoter"
22641,TABLE M,"of vegetation; and, like Proserpina, she alternated between the joy of"

23593,NAMES,
23594,NAMES,
23595,NAMES,I. _Quantity._ The reader must first ascertain whether the second last

23597,NAMES,
23598,NAMES,"(1) If it contains a diphthong, or a long vowel: _Bau_-cis,"
23599,NAMES,"Ac-_tae_-on, _M[=e]_-tis, O-_r[=i]_-on, _Fl[=o]_-ra."
23600,NAMES,
23601,NAMES,"(2) If its vowel, whether long or short, is followed by _j_, _x_, or"

23606,NAMES,"diphthong. In such cases the diæresis is, in this volume, used to"
23607,NAMES,"indicate the division: _e.g._ Men-e-l[=a]'-_üs_, Pe-n[=e]'-_üs_."
23608,NAMES,
23609,NAMES,_Note (b)._ The _syllable_ formed by a short vowel before a mute
23610,NAMES,with _l_ or _r_ is sometimes long and sometimes short: _e.g._
23611,NAMES,"Cle-o-_p[=a]'_-tra, or Cle-op´-_[)a]_-tra; Pa-_tr[=o]'_-clus, or"
23612,NAMES,Pat´-_r[)o]_-clus.

23622,NAMES,

23627,NAMES,"Æ-n[=e]'-as, Her´-c[)u]-les.="
23628,NAMES,
23629,NAMES,(3) The subordinate accent:
23630,NAMES,
23631,NAMES,"_Note (a)_ If only two syllables precede the principal accent,"
23632,NAMES,the subordinate accent falls on the first syllable of the word:
23633,NAMES,_Hip^{2}-po_-cr[=e]'ne.
23634,NAMES,
23635,NAMES,"_Note (b)_ If more than two syllables precede the principal accent, the"

23646,NAMES,III. _Vowels and Consonants._ These rules depend upon those of
23647,NAMES,Syllabication:
23648,NAMES,

23655,NAMES,"But _e_ in the termination _es_ has its long sound: Her´_mes_,"
23656,NAMES,A-tri´-_des_.
23657,NAMES,
23658,NAMES,(3) The vowel _a_ has an _obscure_ sound when it ends an unaccented
23659,NAMES,"syllable: A-chæ´-_a_; so, also, the vowel _i_ or _y_, not final, after"
23660,NAMES,an accented syllable: Hes-per´-_i_-des; and sometimes _i_ or _y_ in an
23661,NAMES,unaccented first syllable: _Ci_-lic´-i-a.
23662,NAMES,
23663,NAMES,(4) Consonants have their usual English sounds; but _c_ and _g_ are
23664,NAMES,"soft before _e_, _i_, _y_, _æ_, and _[oe]_: _Ce´_-to, _Ge´_-ry-on,"
23665,NAMES,"_Gy´-ges_; _ch_ has the sound of _k_: _Chi´_-os; and _c_, _s_, and _t_,"
23666,NAMES,immediately preceded by the accent and standing before _i_ followed by

23668,NAMES,Latin grammars and English dictionaries for exceptions).
23669,NAMES,
23670,NAMES,
23671,NAMES,IV. _Syllabication._
23672,NAMES,
23673,NAMES,"(1) The penultimate syllable ends with a vowel: _e.g._ Pe-_ne´_-us,"
23674,NAMES,"I-_tho´_-me, _A´_-treus, Hel´-_e_-nus;"
23675,NAMES,
23676,NAMES,_Except when_ its vowel is followed by _x_ or by two consonants (not
23677,NAMES,"a mute with _l_ or _r_), then the vowel is joined with the succeeding"
23678,NAMES,"consonant: _Nax_-os, _Cir_-ce, Aga-_mem_-non."
23679,NAMES,
23680,NAMES,(2) Other syllables (not ultimate or penultimate) end with a vowel:
23681,NAMES,_e.g._ _Pi_-ræ-us;

25276,_C. 149-154_,(1) _Phtha_ or _Ptah_: chief deity of Memphis; perhaps
25277,_C. 149-154_,"of foreign origin. His name means the ""opener,"" or the"
25278,_C. 149-154_,"""carver."" He is called ""the Father of the Beginning,"" and"
25279,_C. 149-154_,"as the prime architect, or artificer, recalls the Greek"
25280,_C. 149-154_,"Hephæstus. He is the activity of the ""Spirit,"" Neph,"

25285,_C. 149-154_,_Nefer Atum_: worshiped at Heliopolis as the son of Phtha.
25286,_C. 149-154_,"Like Osiris (see below), he is the sun of the underworld."
25287,_C. 149-154_,_Seb_: the father of the Osirian gods. He is the god of
25288,_C. 149-154_,earth and its vegetation; represented as a man with the
25289,_C. 149-154_,head of a goose; he corresponds with the Greek Cronus; his
25290,_C. 149-154_,consort was Nut.
25291,_C. 149-154_,"_Nut_: wife of Seb, mother of the Osirian gods; the vault"
25292,_C. 149-154_,of heaven; she may be likened to the Greek Rhea.
25293,_C. 149-154_,"_Osi´ris_, or _Hesiri_: the good principle. Identified with"
25294,_C. 149-154_,the vivifying power of the sun and of the waters of the
25295,_C. 149-154_,"Nile. In general, the most human and most beneficent of the"
25296,_C. 149-154_,"Egyptian deities. He is the son of Seb (or, according to"
25297,_C. 149-154_,"some, of Neph, Chnuphis). He may be likened to the Greek"
25298,_C. 149-154_,"Apollo, as a representative of spiritual light; to Dionysus"
25299,_C. 149-154_,in his vivifying function. He wages war with his brother

25301,_C. 149-154_,"him, boxed in a chest, drowned, and finally cut into small"

25303,_C. 149-154_,"of the body of O., and buries them. He becomes protector of"
25304,_C. 149-154_,"the shades, judge of the underworld, the sun of the night,"
25305,_C. 149-154_,the tutelary deity of the Egyptians. He is avenged by his
25306,_C. 149-154_,"son Horus, who, with the aid of Thoth (reason), temporarily"
25307,_C. 149-154_,overcomes Seth. The myth may refer to the daily struggle of
25308,_C. 149-154_,"the sun with darkness, and also to the unending strife of"
25309,_C. 149-154_,"good with evil, the course of human life, and of the life"
25310,_C. 149-154_,after death. O. is represented as a mummy crowned with the

25312,_C. 149-154_,"_I´sis_, or _Hes_: the wife and feminine counterpart of"

25317,_C. 149-154_,"strong young sun of the day, avenges his father, the sun"
25318,_C. 149-154_,"of the underworld. He is Horus the child, Horus the elder"
25319,_C. 149-154_,"(as taking the place of his father on earth), or sometimes"
25320,_C. 149-154_,"Horus Harpocrates, the god of silence. As the latter, he"
25321,_C. 149-154_,holds a finger to his lips. He may be compared with the

25324,_C. 149-154_,"_Ha´thor_, or _Athor_: a goddess often identified with"

25332,_C. 149-154_,"_Nephthys_: a goddess of the dead; the sister of Isis, and"

25334,_C. 149-154_,"_A´pis_: the sacred bull, into which the life of Osiris was"
25335,_C. 149-154_,supposed to have passed. The name also indicates the Nile.
25336,_C. 149-154_,The bull Apis must have certain distinguishing marks; he
25337,_C. 149-154_,was treated like a god; and on his death (he was drowned
25338,_C. 149-154_,at twenty-five years of age) the land went into mourning
25339,_C. 149-154_,until his successor was found. He was worshiped with pomp

25345,_C. 149-154_,_Ra_: originally the deity of the physical attributes of

25348,_C. 149-154_,other gods who are then manifestations of his various
25349,_C. 149-154_,"attributes. He is the victorious principle or light, life,"
25350,_C. 149-154_,"and right, but rules over, rather than sympathizes with,"
25351,_C. 149-154_,"mankind. He is of human form, sometimes hawk-headed, always"
25352,_C. 149-154_,crowned with the sun's disk. His Greek counterpart is not

25361,_C. 149-154_,"with a goat's head, as represented by the Greeks. He"
25362,_C. 149-154_,corresponds to the Greek Zeus. As Amen-Khem he is the god
25363,_C. 149-154_,"of productivity, and is represented with a flail in his"
25364,_C. 149-154_,"hand. His consort is Mut, or Maut, and their son is Khuns."
25365,_C. 149-154_,"_Mut_, or _Maut_: the mother; the Theban goddess of"

25375,_C. 149-154_,the energizing principle of physical life. Associated
25376,_C. 149-154_,with both Ammon and Osiris. His counterpart in classical
25377,_C. 149-154_,"mythology is Pan, or, as god of gardens, Priapus."
25378,_C. 149-154_,_Neith_: goddess of the upper heaven; self-produced;
25379,_C. 149-154_,"mother of the sun; goddess, consequently, of wisdom, the"
