61,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
62,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
63,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"The poetry of each age may be considered as vitally connected with, and"
64,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"as vividly reflective of, its character and progress, as either its"
65,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,politics or its religion. You see the nature of the soil of a garden in
66,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"its tulips and roses, as much as in its pot-herbs and its towering"
67,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"trees. We purpose, accordingly, to compare briefly the poetry of the"
68,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"past and of the present centuries, as indices of some of the points of"
69,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"contrast between the two, and to show also how, and through what causes,"
70,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,the one grew into the other. This will be a fitting introduction to a
71,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,consideration of the life and writings of the first of the poets of this
72,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"century included in our series, the more as he was in a measure the"
73,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,father of modern poetry.
74,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
75,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,It is impossible to take up a volume of the poetry of the eighteenth
76,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"century, such as, for instance, Churchill's, or Pope's, or Johnson's,"
77,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,and to compare it with some of the leading poetical works of the
78,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"present, such as the poems of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and Byron,"
79,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,and not to feel as if you were reading the productions of two different
80,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"races of beings--so different are the style, the sentiments, the modes"
81,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of thought, the imagery, the temperament, and the spirit of the poets"
82,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and the poetry. It is like stepping, we will not say from the frigid,"
83,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,but from the temperate into the torrid zone. In the one class of authors
84,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"you find the prevalence of strong sense, flanked by wit and by fancy,"
85,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,but without much that can be called imaginative or romantic. In the
86,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"other, imagination or fancy is the regnant faculty; and if wit and sense"
87,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"are there too, they are there as slaves, the ""Slaves of the lamp,"" to"
88,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the imperious imaginative power. The style of the one is clear,"
89,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"masculine, sententious, and measured; that of the other is bold,"
90,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"unmeasured, diffuse, fervid, and sometimes obscure. The one style may be"
91,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"compared to a clear crescent; the other to a full, but partially"
92,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"eclipsed, moon. The sentiment of the one is chiefly the sublimation of"
93,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"passion: bitter contempt, noble indignation, a proud, stern patriotism,"
94,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"sometimes united with a sombre, but manly melancholy, are the principal"
95,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"feelings expressed; that of the other, although occasionally morbid, is"
96,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"far more varied, more profound, purer, on the whole, and more poetical."
97,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,The thought of the one is acute and logical; that of the other aspires
98,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"to the deep, if not to the mystical and the transcendental. The subjects"
99,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,of the poets of the eighteenth century are generally of a dignified cast
100,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"(except in the case of satirical productions), such as ""The Temple of"
101,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Fame,"" ""The Pleasures of Imagination,"" ""The Traveller,"" ""London,"" and"
102,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"""The Vanity of Human Wishes."" The subjects of the other class are as"
103,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,varied as their mode of treatment is often daringly peculiar. The
104,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"leech-gatherer on his lonely moor, the pedlar on his humble rounds, the"
105,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"tinker linked by a ""fellow-feeling"" to the animal he beats and starves,"
106,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"a mad mariner, a divorced wife, a wandering roué--such characters as"
107,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,these have called forth the utmost stretch of the powers of our best
108,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,modern poets. The images of the former race of poets are limited to what
109,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,are called classical subjects--including in this term the ancient
110,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"mythologies, the incidents in Grecian and Roman story, the more"
111,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"beautiful objects of nature, and the more popular productions of art."
112,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,Those of modern poets acknowledge no boundary--from the firmament to the
113,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"fungus, from Niagara to the nearest puddle, from the cold scalp of Mont"
114,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,Blanc to the snowball of the schoolboy--all things are free and open to
115,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the step of their genius, which, like the moonbeam, touches and"
116,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,beautifies every object on which it rests. The temperament of the two
117,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,races is as distinct as their sentiment and style; that of the one
118,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"seeming somewhat curbed, if not cold, while that of the other is ardent"
119,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"always, and often enthusiastic and rapturous. Different also their"
120,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"spirit; the one being confined and sectarian, alike in politics, in"
121,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"literature, and in religion; the other, in some of their number, being"
122,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"liberal to latitudinarianism, and genial to a vice."
123,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
124,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,We are not at present seeking to settle the precedence of these two
125,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"schools of poetry. We love and honour much in both, and think the"
126,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,criticism small and captious which can be blind to the peculiar merits
127,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of either--to the terseness, condensation, force of single lines, vigour"
128,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of logical thought, and general correctness of the one; or to the"
129,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"boldness, brilliant diffusion, breadth, and variety of mood and music,"
130,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of subject and of treatment, which distinguish the other. It is more"
131,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,specially our object at present to show how each sprang naturally and
132,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,inevitably out of the different ages when they appeared.
133,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
134,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,Poetry is an age in flower; and the poetry of the nineteenth century has
135,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"been a more gorgeous and more tropical flower, because warmer suns have"
136,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"shone on it, warmer winds blown on it, and larger rains watered its"
137,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"roots. Indeed, it is almost a wonder that the first half, at least, and"
138,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the middle of the eighteenth century, produced so much and such good"
139,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"poetry. That age was, on the whole, a stagnant and uninteresting one."
140,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,There was nothing very deeply to rouse the passions and imaginations of
141,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"men. There was, indeed, the usual amount of political squabbles; but"
142,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,when a Bolingbroke was the most eloquent and admired of parliamentary
143,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"orators, what moral grandeur could be expected? There was a Jacobite"
144,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"faction, perpetually undermining and sometimes breaking out into open"
145,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"rebellion; but their enthusiasm, save in Scotland, was mingled with no"
146,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"poetical elements, although there certainly it produced many exquisite"
147,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,strains of ballad poetry. Twice or thrice the popular passions broke
148,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"forth, and reared up an idol for themselves in the shape of a"
149,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"private man, exalted for the nonce into a hero; but it is"
150,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,significant to remember that the two principal of these idols were
151,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"_calves_--Sacheverel, namely, and Jack Wilkes. The wars in that age were"
152,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"almost entirely destitute of imaginative interest; those of Marlborough,"
153,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"such as Blenheim and Ramilies, were just large games of chess, played on"
154,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,a blood-red board--who now ever thinks or talks about the battles of
155,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Fontenoy or Minden?--some tolerable sea-fights, indeed, there were; on"
156,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the heights of Abraham a brave man expired in the arms of victory, and a"
157,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,glory still lingers on the field of Prestonpans and on the bloody plains
158,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of Culloden; but there was no Trafalgar, no Waterloo, and no Inkermann."
159,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"The manners of the age were not only dissolute, but grossly and brutally"
160,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"so. In England, there was no Burns to cast a gleam of poetry even on the"
161,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,orgies of dissipation; all was as coarse as it was corrupt; it was a
162,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"drunken dance of naked satyrs: and disgust at this state of things, we"
163,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"believe, principally made Burke, contrasting the Continent with England,"
164,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"to utter the paradox, that vice, by losing all its grossness, lost half"
165,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"its evil. Foreigners were then, as they are still, more depraved in"
166,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"morals and filthier in personal habits than we; but they had, and have,"
167,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"a grace, a politeness, a reticence, and an ease, which gilded, if they"
168,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"did not lessen, the abominations. The religion of the country was"
169,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,reduced to a very low point of depression; the churches were filled with
170,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"drowsy divines, drowsily reading what they never wrote, to yet drowsier"
171,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"congregations; many of the upper classes, and of the literary men, were"
172,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"avowed infidels; till the rise of Methodism, religious enthusiasm in any"
173,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,class did not exist--even in Scotland the load of patronage had nearly
174,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,extinguished the old fires of Covenanting zeal--the state of the lower
175,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"classes was deplorable, so far, at least, as mental culture and morality"
176,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"were concerned; cock-fighting, grinning through collars, bull-baiting,"
177,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and hard drinking, were their main amusements; the hallowing and"
178,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,spiritualising influences of the Sabbath-day were scarcely known; and
179,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,the upper ranks had no feeling that they were in some measure
180,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"responsible for the ignorance and the vice of the lower, and were bound"
181,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"to circulate education and religion amidst their masses; indeed, how"
182,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"could they be expected, since they themselves had little education and"
183,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"less religion to circulate? In science, philosophy, and general"
184,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"literature, there prevailed a partial syncope and pause. Newton was"
185,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"dead, and had left no successor; Locke was dead, and had left no"
186,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"successor. The wits of Queen Anne's reign, Swift, Pope, Arbuthnot,"
187,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Steele, and Addison, were dropping off one by one, and for a season none"
188,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,arose adequate to supply their place. It had altogether become an age of
189,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"mediocrity; neither an age of stern conflict, like that of the Puritans,"
190,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"nor even a fiercely lawless and riotous age, like that of Charles the"
191,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Second, nor a transition age, like that of the Revolution, but an age of"
192,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,a negative and slumbrous character; its only positive qualities were a
193,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,generally diffused laxity of principle and corruption of practice; but
194,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"its vices, as well as its virtues, were small; it had not virtue to be"
195,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"greatly good, nor daring to be greatly wicked."
196,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
197,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"All this told on its poetry; and our wonder, we repeat, is, that it did"
198,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"not tell more. That it did not, was probably owing to the continued"
199,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"prevalence of the power of classical literature. That, increased by the"
200,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"influence of the universities and the great schools, and by the"
201,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"translations made of its masterpieces by Dryden and Pope, contributed to"
202,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"produce and maintain purity of taste, in the midst of general"
203,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"depravation of manners, and to touch many opening minds with the chaste"
204,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,and manly inspiration of a long past age. Hence the poetry of the first
205,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"half of the eighteenth century, while inferior in force and richness to"
206,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"that of the end of the seventeenth, is superior in good taste, and is"
207,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"much freer from impurities. To this the imitation of French models, too,"
208,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,contributed. Still we see the traces of the period very distinctly
209,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"marked in its works of art and in its poetry. The paintings of Hogarth,"
210,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"next to the infinite richness of the painter's invention, and the"
211,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"accuracy of his observation and touch, testify to the corruption of"
212,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"these times. They are everlasting libels--as true, however, as they are"
213,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,libellous--on the age of the first two Georges; and we are astonished
214,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"how such an age produced such a genius, as well as grieved to see how"
215,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,such a genius had no better materials to work on than were furnished by
216,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,such an age. It is much the same with the novels of Smollett and
217,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Fielding, and with parts of the poetry of Churchill, Lloyd, and others."
218,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"The formal wars of that day, too, were certain to produce formal poetry,"
219,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and Blenheim was fitly celebrated in Addison's ""Campaign."" The sceptical"
220,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"philosophy then prevalent was faithfully mirrored in Pope's ""Essay on"
221,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Man,"" which, exquisite as a work of art, is, in thought, a system of"
222,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"naturalism set to music; and, while its art is the poet's own, its"
223,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"doctrine comes from the ""fell genius"" of St John (Bolingbroke). Up to"
224,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Thomson's fine ""Ode on the Death of Sir Isaac Newton,"" and the ""Night"
225,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Thoughts,"" the great discoveries of astronomy obtained no poetical"
226,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"recognition. Religious poetry, properly speaking, there was none; for"
227,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the hymns of Watts, although full of piety, can scarcely be called"
228,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,poems; and the most popular poetry of the time was either founded on the
229,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Latin, or written in imitation of Pope. Johnson's ""London"" and ""Vanity"
230,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of Human Wishes"" are instances of the former; and of the latter,"
231,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,specimens too numerous to mention abounded.
232,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
233,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Thus it continued till about the middle of the century, when there began"
234,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"to appear symptoms of a change. First of all, a ""fine fat fellow"" from"
235,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Scotland, who had derived inspiration from the breezes of the Tweed and"
236,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the Jed, wrote that noble strain, ""The Seasons,"" with its daguerreotypic"
237,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"painting of nature, and its generous, healthy enthusiasm, and the"
238,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"""Castle of Indolence,"" with its exquisite sketches of character and"
239,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"scenery, and its rich reproduction of an antique style of poetry."
240,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Thomson's voice did not, indeed, produce a revolution in taste, but it"
241,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,obtained an audience for a species of writing entirely different from
242,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"what then prevailed. Young, next, in a bolder spirit, having broken the"
243,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"trammels of Pope, which had confined him, soared up through Night and"
244,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"all its worlds, and brought down genuine inspiration on his adventurous"
245,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"wing. Dr Johnson, although considerably hampered in his verse by undue"
246,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"admiration of the mechanical poets, allowed himself greater liberty in"
247,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"his prose, which glowed with a deep, if somewhat turbid life, and"
248,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"rolled on in a strong and solemn current, which often seemed that of"
249,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"high imagination. Collins, smitten with a true ""gadfly,"" born as one out"
250,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of due time, and, alas! ""blasted with the celestial fire,"" he brought,"
251,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"anticipated, in part, some of the miraculous effects of more modern"
252,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"poetry. Gray, Mason, and Beattie, three men of unequal name, all wrote"
253,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"in a different style from Addison, Swift, and Pope, and two of them"
254,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"displayed genuine, if not very powerful, genius. Then came Percy, with"
255,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"his ""Reliques of Ancient Poetry,"" which showed what wonders our rude"
256,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,forefathers had wrought by the force of simple nature; and to the same
257,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"end contributed Ossian's Poems, which, whatever their defects, awakened"
258,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and startled the literary world, here, in France, and in Germany, by a"
259,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"panoramic view of that ""land of mountain and of flood,"" which was yet to"
260,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"attract so many visitors, and to inspire so many bards. The impulse lent"
261,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"to our prose style by Johnson was followed up by Junius and by Burke,"
262,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,both of whom shot into the discussions of politics and of passing events
263,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"much of the spirit and the power of poetry. Burke especially, even"
264,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"before the French Revolution effectually roused the world, had given"
265,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"specimens of fervid prose, combining with matter of fact and the most"
266,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"compact wisdom, the graces, the spirit, the imagery, and the language of"
267,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the highest imagination. Cowper, too, had come, setting religion to"
268,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"rhythm; and, although ""veiling all the lightnings of his song in"
269,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"sorrow,"" yet circulating the power of his genius, even more extensively"
270,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"than the contagion of his grief. Burns, in Scotland, had exhibited his"
271,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"vein of ardent native genius. And lastly, the French Revolution lifted"
272,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"up its volcano voice, and said to the world of literature and song, as"
273,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"well as to the world at large, ""_Sleep no more_."""
274,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
275,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"From this date the character of poetry was changed, and began to assume"

277,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"described in our commencing remarks, and which yet continues. Britain"

282,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"religion became more intense and earnest, and this produced, on the one"

291,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"after coquetting for a little, not very gracefully, with Science in"
292,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Darwin's ""Botanic Garden,"" and ""Temple of Nature,"" aspired to the hand"
293,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,of Philosophy; and the Lake poets and others not merely found a poetic
294,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"worship in nature, but set to song many of the wondrous speculations of"
295,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"modern psychology. A taste for ancient, simple poetic writers spread"
296,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"widely, and produced Scott's brilliant imitations of ballad poetry, and"
297,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Wordsworth's early lyrical strains. Popular principles began to prevail,"
298,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,and knowledge to circulate among the lower classes; and they learned not
299,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"only to read poems with relish, but their ""poor dumb mouths"" ever and"
300,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,anon were opened to utter a stern and vigorous poetry of their own.
301,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Along with these and other beneficial changes, there were, indeed, much"
302,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,extravagance and exaggeration introduced. With the formality and
303,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"stiffness, much of the point, pith, and correctness of the old school"
304,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"was lost--a good deal of false enthusiasm and pretence, mingled with the"
305,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"real inspiration; jackdaws and mocking-birds, as well as doves and"
306,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"eagles, abounded. But, on the whole, we question if any age of the world"
307,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"has equalled the early part of the nineteenth century, in the quantity,"

315,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,inspired the more powerful muse of Coleridge--was descended from an
316,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,ancient and respectable family in Wiltshire. His grandfather and father
317,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,were both clergymen in the Church of England. The poet was born in
318,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"King's Sutton, and baptized there on the 25th of September 1762. In the"
319,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,year 1776 he was placed on the Wykeham foundation at Winchester. His
320,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"master was Dr Joseph Warton, who, seeing genius disguised under the veil"
321,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of his pupil's boyish timidity, encouraged him in his efforts, was"
322,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"warmly loved by Bowles in return, and transmitted to him his very"
323,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,moderate estimate of the poetry and character of Pope. Bowles has
324,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"testified his gratitude to his teacher in his very pleasing ""Monody on"
325,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the Death of Dr Warton."" During the last year he passed at Winchester,"
326,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Bowles was captain of the school. In the year 1781, he was elected a"
327,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, having selected this college,"
328,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"because the brother of his old master, Thomas Warton, was residing"
329,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"there. In 1783, he gained the Chancellor's prize for Latin verse--""Calpe"
330,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Obessa; or, The Siege of Gibraltar,"" being the subject of the poem. At"
331,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"college he got no fellowship, nor did he procure his degree till 1792."
332,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"At an early age, he is said to have been unsuccessful in his suit to a"
333,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Miss Romilly, a niece of Sir Samuel Romilly; and this rejection it was"
334,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"which first stung him into rhyme and rambling; for, in order to deaden"
335,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"his feelings, he traversed the north of England, Scotland, and parts of"
336,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the Continent. His first production consisted of fourteen sonnets,"
337,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"published in 1789, and was followed the same year by ""Verses to John"
338,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Howard."" In 1790, he reprinted these and various other pieces written in"

354,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,The events of this gentleman's private and professional life were of no
355,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"particular interest. Having entered holy orders, he resided for many"
356,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"years as curate in Donhead St Andrew, in Wilts, where he remained till"
357,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"1804, when he was appointed vicar of Bremhill--a situation which he"
358,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"continued to fill till the end of his long life. In 1792, he was"
359,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"presented to the vicarage of Checklade, in Wiltshire, which he resigned,"
360,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"after an incumbency of five years, on receiving another presentation to"
361,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the rectory of Dumbleton, Gloucestershire. This living he retained till"
362,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"his death, although he never resided at either Dumbleton or Checklade."
363,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"In 1804, through Archbishop Moore, he was made vicar of Bremhill, and,"
364,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the same year, prebend of Stratford in the cathedral church of"
365,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Salisbury. In 1828, he was elected canon-residentiary. He had, in 1818,"
366,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,been appointed chaplain to the Prince Regent. He resided constantly at
367,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Bremhill for twenty-five years. After he was elected canon, however, he"
368,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"abode partly, and in the latter years of his life principally, in the"
369,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"town of Salisbury. In 1797, he married Magdalene, daughter of the Rev."
370,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Charles Wake, D.D., prebendary of Westminster, and grand-daughter of"
371,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Archbishop Wake. She died some years before her husband, and left no"
372,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"family. Bowles himself expired at Salisbury, after a gradual decay of"
373,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"the vital powers, April 7, 1850, aged eighty-eight years. His life is"
374,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"about to be written at large by his kinsman, Dr J. Bowles, assisted by"
375,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Mr Alaric Watts, to whom the publisher is indebted for the means of"
376,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,supplying a complete copyright edition of the poet's works.
377,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
378,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Bowles was a diligent pastor, an eloquent preacher, an active justice,"
379,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and in every way an estimable man. Even Byron, who met him at Mr"
380,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Rogers', in London, speaks of him as a ""pleasant, gentlemanly man--a"
381,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"good fellow for a parson."" Moore, in his Diary, speaks with delight of"
382,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"his mixture of talent and simplicity. In his introduction to ""Scenes"
383,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and Shadows,"" Bowles gives some interesting particulars of his early"
384,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"life. In _Blackwood_, for August 1828, there is a very entertaining"
385,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,account of Bremhill Parsonage.
386,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
387,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"As an author, he appears in three aspects--as a writer on typography, as"
388,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"an editor and controversialist, and as a poet. In 1828, he produced a"
389,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"volume entitled ""The Parochial History of Bremhill,"" and shortly"
390,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"afterwards, his ""History of Lacock Abbey,"" containing much interesting"
391,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,antiquarian lore. To this succeeded a still more ingenious and recondite
392,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"work, entitled ""Hermes Britannicus,"" besides some less important"
393,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"writings of a similar kind. His ""Life of Bishop Ken,"" which appeared in"
394,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"1830 and 1831, might be considered as belonging to the same category of"
395,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,learned antiquarian lucubrations.
396,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
397,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"In 1807, he published an edition of Pope, in ten volumes, for which he"
398,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,received £300. The life prefixed to this edition led to the celebrated
399,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"controversy between Bowles, on the one hand, and Campbell, Byron,"
400,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Roscoe, Octavius Gilchrist, and the _Quarterly Review_, on the other. In"
401,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"our life of Pope, we hope to devote a few pages to the principal"
402,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"questions which were mooted in this controversy. We may simply say, at"
403,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"present, that we think Bowles was, in the main, right, although he laid"
404,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"himself open to retort at many points, and displayed an _animus_ against"
405,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Pope, both as a man and a poet, which he in vain sought to disclaim, and"
406,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"which somewhat detracted from the value of his criticisms. He gained,"
407,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"however, the three objects at which he aimed:--he proved that Pope was"
408,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"only at the head of the _second_ rank of poets--that, as a man, he was"
409,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"guilty of many meannesses, and had a prurient imagination and pen--and"
410,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"that the objects of artificial life are, _per se_, less fitted for the"
411,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"purposes of poetry than those of nature, and than the passions"
412,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"of the human heart. In this controversy, as well as in some"
413,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"after-skirmishes,--in his letters to Lord Brougham, ""On the Position and"
414,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Incomes of the Cathedral Clergy,""--in a letter to Sir James Mackintosh,"
415,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"on the Increase of Crime,--and in a sharp fight with the Rev. Edward"
416,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Duke, F.S.A., on the Antiquities of Wiltshire--Bowles displayed amazing"
417,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"PLUCK, and no small controversial acuteness and dexterity. Like another"
418,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Ajax, he took enemy after enemy on his single shield, and by his"
419,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"pertinacity and perseverance, he succeeded in beating them all. He stood"
420,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"at first alone, and had very formidable opponents. But he bated not one"
421,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"jot of heart or hope; and, by and by, Southey, _Blackwood's Magazine_,"
422,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and others, came to his aid, and, finally, William Hazlitt saw, with his"
423,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"inevitable eye, the real merits of the case, and (substantially"
424,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"inclining to the Bowles side) settled, by a paper in the _London"
425,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Magazine_, the question for ever. As a controversialist, Bowles is"
426,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"rather noisy, flippant, and fierce; and his reply to Byron, while"
427,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"superior to the noble bard's letter in argument, is far inferior in easy"
428,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,and trenchant vigour of style. His writings on the Pope controversy
429,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"consist of ""A Letter to Thomas Campbell,"" ""Two Letters to Lord Byron,"""
430,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"""A Final Appeal to the Public relative to Pope,"" and (more last words!),"
431,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"""Lessons in Criticism to William Roscoe, and Farther Lessons to a"
432,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"Quarterly Reviewer."" All are exceedingly readable and clever."
433,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,
434,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,It is curious contrasting the spirit of Bowles' prose--his severity--his
435,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"pugnacity--his irritability, with the mild qualities of his poetry. The"
436,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"leading element in all his poetical works is sentiment,--warm, mellow,"
437,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"tender, and often melancholy sentiment. He has no profound thought--no"
438,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,powerful pictures of passion--no creative imagination--but over all his
439,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,poetry lies a sweet autumnal moonlight of pensive and gentle feeling. In
440,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"his larger poems, he is often diffuse and verbose, and you see more"
441,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"effort than energy. But in his smaller, and especially in his sonnets,"
442,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"and his pieces descriptive of nature, Bowles is always true to his own"
443,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"heart, and therefore always successful. How delightful such sonnets as"
444,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"his ""Morning Bells,"" ""Absence,"" ""Bereavement,"" and his poems entitled,"
445,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"""Monody at Matlock,"" ""Coombe-Ellen,"" ""On Hearing the 'Messiah,'"" _etc._!"
446,WORKS OF THE REV. W. L. BOWLES.,"We trust that many, after reading these and the others (some of which"

907,BANWELL CAVE.,
908,BANWELL CAVE.,The following extract of a letter from Mr Warner will enable the
909,BANWELL CAVE.,reader to form his own opinion concerning the vast accumulation of
910,BANWELL CAVE.,bones in this cave:--
911,BANWELL CAVE.,
912,BANWELL CAVE.,"""The sagacity of Mr Beard having detected the existence of the"
913,BANWELL CAVE.,"cavern, and his perseverance effected a precipitous descent into"
914,BANWELL CAVE.,"it, the objects offered to his notice were of the most astonishing"
915,BANWELL CAVE.,"and paradoxical description--'an antre vast,' rude from the hand of"
916,BANWELL CAVE.,"nature, of various elevations, and branching into several recesses;"
917,BANWELL CAVE.,"its floor overspread with a huge mingled mass of bones and mud,"
918,BANWELL CAVE.,"black earth (or decomposed animal matter), and sand from the Severn"
919,BANWELL CAVE.,"sea, which flows about six miles to the northward of Banwell"
920,BANWELL CAVE.,"village. The quantity of bones, and the mode by which they could be"
921,BANWELL CAVE.,"conveyed to, and deposited in, the place they occupied, were points"
922,BANWELL CAVE.,of equal difficulty to be explained: as the former amounted to
923,BANWELL CAVE.,several waggon loads; and as no access to the cavern appeared to
924,BANWELL CAVE.,"exist, except a fissure from above, utterly incapable, from its"
925,BANWELL CAVE.,"narrow dimensions, of admitting the falling in of any animal larger"
926,BANWELL CAVE.,"than a common sheep; whereas it was evident that huge quadrupeds,"
927,BANWELL CAVE.,"such as unknown beasts of the ox tribe, bears, wolves, and probably"
928,BANWELL CAVE.,"hyenas and tigers, had perished in the cave. But, though the"
929,BANWELL CAVE.,"questions _how_ and _when_ were unanswerable, _this_ conclusion was"
930,BANWELL CAVE.,"irresistibly forced upon the mind, by the phenomena submitted to"
931,BANWELL CAVE.,"the eye, that, as the receptacle was infinitely too small to"
932,BANWELL CAVE.,"contain such a crowd of animals in their living state, they must"
933,BANWELL CAVE.,necessarily have occupied it in succession: one portion of them
934,BANWELL CAVE.,"after another paying the debt of nature, and (leaving their bones"
935,BANWELL CAVE.,"only, as a memorial of their existence on the spot) thus making"
936,BANWELL CAVE.,"room in the cavern for a succeeding set of inhabitants, of"
937,BANWELL CAVE.,"similarly ferocious habits to themselves. The difficulty, indeed,"
938,BANWELL CAVE.,of the ingress of such beasts into the cave did not long continue
939,BANWELL CAVE.,to be invincible; as Mr Beard discovered and cleared out a lateral
940,BANWELL CAVE.,"aperture in it, sufficiently inclining from the perpendicular, and"
941,BANWELL CAVE.,"sufficiently large in its dimensions, to admit of the easy descent"
942,BANWELL CAVE.,"into this subterraneous apartment of one of its unwieldy tenants,"
943,BANWELL CAVE.,though loaded with its prey.
944,BANWELL CAVE.,
945,BANWELL CAVE.,"""From the circumstances premised, you will probably anticipate my"
946,BANWELL CAVE.,"thoughts on these remarkable phenomena; if not, they are as"
947,BANWELL CAVE.,follow:--I consider the cavern to have been formed at the period of
948,BANWELL CAVE.,the original deposition and consolidation of the matter
949,BANWELL CAVE.,constituting the mountain limestone in which it is found; possibly
950,BANWELL CAVE.,"by the agency of some elastic gas, imprisoned in the mass, which"
951,BANWELL CAVE.,prevented the approximation of its particles to each other; or by
952,BANWELL CAVE.,some unaccountable interruption to the operation of the usual laws
953,BANWELL CAVE.,"of its crystallization;--that, for a long succession of ages"
954,BANWELL CAVE.,"anterior to the Deluge, and previously to man's inhabiting the"
955,BANWELL CAVE.,"colder regions of the earth, Banwell Cave had been inhabited by"
956,BANWELL CAVE.,"successive generations of beasts of prey; which, as hunger"
957,BANWELL CAVE.,"dictated, issued from their den, pursued and slaughtered the"
958,BANWELL CAVE.,"gregarious animals, or wilder quadrupeds, in its neighbourhood; and"
959,BANWELL CAVE.,"dragged them, either bodily or piecemeal, to this retreat, in order"
960,BANWELL CAVE.,"to feast upon them at leisure, and undisturbed;--that the bottom of"
961,BANWELL CAVE.,"the cavern thus became a kind of charnel-house, of various and"
962,BANWELL CAVE.,unnumbered beasts;--that this scene of excursive carnage continued
963,BANWELL CAVE.,"till 'the flood came,' blending 'the oppressor with the oppressed,'"
964,BANWELL CAVE.,and mixing the hideous furniture of the den with a quantity of
965,BANWELL CAVE.,"extraneous matter, brought from the adjoining shore, and subjacent"
966,BANWELL CAVE.,"lands, by the waters of the Deluge, which rolled, surging (as"
967,BANWELL CAVE.,"Kirwan imagines), from the north-western quarter;--that, previously"
968,BANWELL CAVE.,"to this total submersion, as the flood increased on the lower"
969,BANWELL CAVE.,"grounds, the animals which fed upon them ascended the heights of"
970,BANWELL CAVE.,"Mendip, to escape impending death; and with panic rushed (as many"
971,BANWELL CAVE.,as could gain entrance) into this dwelling-place of their worst
972,BANWELL CAVE.,"enemies;--that numberless birds also, terrified by the elemental"
973,BANWELL CAVE.,"tumult, flew into the same den, as a place of temporary"
974,BANWELL CAVE.,refuge;--that the interior of the cavern was speedilly filled by
975,BANWELL CAVE.,"the roaring Deluge, whose waters, dashing and crushing the various"
976,BANWELL CAVE.,"substances which they embraced, against the rugged rocks, or"
977,BANWELL CAVE.,against each other; and continuing this violent and incessant
978,BANWELL CAVE.,"action for at least three months, at length tore asunder every"
979,BANWELL CAVE.,"connected form, separated every skeleton, and produced that"
980,BANWELL CAVE.,"confusion of substances, that scene of _disjecta membra_, that"
981,BANWELL CAVE.,"mixture and disjunction of bones, which were apparent on the first"
982,BANWELL CAVE.,inspection of the cavern; and which are now visible in that part of
983,BANWELL CAVE.,"it which has been hitherto untouched."""

986,BANWELL CAVE.,
987,BANWELL CAVE.,"Respecting the language of the Poem, I had nearly forgotten one"
988,BANWELL CAVE.,"remark. In almost all the local poems I have read, there is a"
989,BANWELL CAVE.,confusion of the following nature. A local descriptive poem must
990,BANWELL CAVE.,"consist, first, of the graphic view of the scenery around the spot"
991,BANWELL CAVE.,"from whence the view is taken; and, secondly, of the reflections"
992,BANWELL CAVE.,and feelings which that view may be supposed to excite. The
993,BANWELL CAVE.,feelings of the heart naturally associate themselves with the idea
994,BANWELL CAVE.,of the tones of the supposed poetical harp; but external scenes are
995,BANWELL CAVE.,"the province of the pencil, for the harp cannot paint woods and"
996,BANWELL CAVE.,"hills, and therefore, in almost all descriptive poems, the pencil"
997,BANWELL CAVE.,"and the lyre clash. Hence, in one page, the poet speaks of his"
998,BANWELL CAVE.,"lyre, and in the next, when he leaves feelings to paint to the eye,"
999,BANWELL CAVE.,"before the harp is out of the hand, he turns to the pencil! This"
1000,BANWELL CAVE.,"fault is almost inevitable; the reader, therefore, will see in the"
1001,BANWELL CAVE.,"first page of this Poem, that the graphic pencil is assumed, when"
1002,BANWELL CAVE.,the tones of the harp were inappropriate.

1252,HOLMS--SEA.,"In unfrequented wilds, and forest-glens,"
1253,HOLMS--SEA.,"The towers of the sequestered abbey shone,                        170"
1254,HOLMS--SEA.,As when the pinnacles of Glaston-Fane
1255,HOLMS--SEA.,"First met the morning light. The parish church,"
1256,HOLMS--SEA.,"Then too, exulting o'er the ruder cross,"
1257,HOLMS--SEA.,"Upsprung, till soon the distant village peal"

1271,HOLMS--SEA.,"Slow let us climb. First look upon that flower,"
1272,HOLMS--SEA.,"The lowly heath-bell, smiling at our feet."
1273,HOLMS--SEA.,How beautiful it smiles alone! The Power                          190
1274,HOLMS--SEA.,"That bade the great sea roar, that spread the heavens,"
1275,HOLMS--SEA.,"That called the sun from darkness, decked that flower,"
1276,HOLMS--SEA.,And bade it grace this bleak and barren hill.
1277,HOLMS--SEA.,"Imagination, in her playful mood,"
1278,HOLMS--SEA.,"Might liken it to a poor village maid,"
1279,HOLMS--SEA.,"Lowly, but smiling in her lowliness,"
1280,HOLMS--SEA.,And dressed so neatly as if every day
1281,HOLMS--SEA.,Were Sunday. And some melancholy bard
1282,HOLMS--SEA.,"Might, idly musing, thus discourse to it:--"
1283,HOLMS--SEA.,"Daughter of Summer, who dost linger here,                         200"
1284,HOLMS--SEA.,"Decking the thistly turf, and arid hill,"
1285,HOLMS--SEA.,"Unseen, let the majestic dahlia"
1286,HOLMS--SEA.,"Glitter, an empress, in her blazonry"

1289,HOLMS--SEA.,"Sailing upon the blue lake silently,"
1290,HOLMS--SEA.,That lifts her tall neck higher as she views
1291,HOLMS--SEA.,Her shadow in the stream! Such ladies bright

1296,HOLMS--SEA.,"Come, live with me, and we two will rejoice:"

1298,HOLMS--SEA.,"Shines in the silent moonlight, elves and fays,"
1299,HOLMS--SEA.,"Gentle and delicate as Ariel,"

1311,HOLMS--SEA.,Where I remember a few cottages
1312,HOLMS--SEA.,"Sprinkling the sand, uplifts its tower, and shines,"
1313,HOLMS--SEA.,"As if in conscious beauty, o'er the scene.                        230"
1314,HOLMS--SEA.,"And I have seen a far more welcome sight,"
1315,HOLMS--SEA.,The living line of population stream--

1318,HOLMS--SEA.,In the brief compass of one hastening life!
1319,HOLMS--SEA.,"And yet that hill, the light, is to my eyes"
1320,HOLMS--SEA.,Familiar as those sister isles that sit
1321,HOLMS--SEA.,"In the mid channel! Look, how calm they sit,"
1322,HOLMS--SEA.,As listening each to the tide's rocking roar!
1323,HOLMS--SEA.,"Of different aspects--this, abrupt and high,                      240"
1324,HOLMS--SEA.,"And desolate, and cold, and bleak, uplifts"
1325,HOLMS--SEA.,"Its barren brow--barren, but on its steep"
1326,HOLMS--SEA.,"One native flower is seen, the peony;"
1327,HOLMS--SEA.,"One flower, which smiles in sunshine or in storm,"
1328,HOLMS--SEA.,"There sits companionless, but yet not sad:"

1332,HOLMS--SEA.,"When evening winds blow hollow o'er the rock,"
1333,HOLMS--SEA.,"In autumn's gloom! So Virtue, a fair flower,"

1344,HOLMS--SEA.,Yonder island
1345,HOLMS--SEA.,"Seems not so desolate, nor frowns aloof,"
1346,HOLMS--SEA.,"As if from human kind. The lighthouse there,"
1347,HOLMS--SEA.,"Through the long winter night, shows its pale fire;"

1351,HOLMS--SEA.,As man looks now!--they died and left no name!
1352,HOLMS--SEA.,"Fancy might think, amid the wilderness"

1354,HOLMS--SEA.,All memory of their fortunes. Till the trump

1372,HOLMS--SEA.,"Thou seemest now as calm, as if a child"
1373,HOLMS--SEA.,"Might dally with thy playfulness, and stand,                      290"
1374,HOLMS--SEA.,The weak winds lifting gently its light hair;
1375,HOLMS--SEA.,"Upon thy margin, watching one by one"
1376,HOLMS--SEA.,"The long waves, breaking slow, with such a sound"

1471,PRESENT.,"Dark clouds are round thee; but, lo! Memory waves"
1472,PRESENT.,"Her wand,--the clouds disperse, as the gray rack"
1473,PRESENT.,"Disperses while we gaze, and light steals out,"
1474,PRESENT.,While the gaunt phantom almost seems to drop
1475,PRESENT.,"His scythe! Now shadows of the past, distinct,"
1476,PRESENT.,Are thronging round; the voices of the dead
1477,PRESENT.,"Are heard; and, lo! the very smoke goes up--"
1478,PRESENT.,"For so it seems--from yonder tenement,                             60"
1479,PRESENT.,Where leads the slender pathway to the door.
1480,PRESENT.,"Enter that small blue parlour: there sits one,"
1481,PRESENT.,"A female, and a child is in her arms;"
1482,PRESENT.,"A child leans at her side, intent to show"
1483,PRESENT.,"A pictured book, and looks upon her face;"
1484,PRESENT.,"One, from the green, comes with a cowslip ball;[18]"
1485,PRESENT.,"And one,[19] a hero, sits sublime and horsed,"
1486,PRESENT.,"Upon a rocking-steed, from Banwell-fair;"
1487,PRESENT.,"This,[20] drives his tiny wheel-barrow, without,"
1488,PRESENT.,"On the green garden-sward; whilst one,[21] apart,"
1489,PRESENT.,Sighs o'er his solemn task--the spelling-book--                    70
1490,PRESENT.,"Half moody, half in tears. Some lines of thought"
1491,PRESENT.,"Are on that matron's brow; yet placidness,"
1492,PRESENT.,"Such as resigned religion gives, is there,"
1493,PRESENT.,"Mingled with sadness; for who e'er beheld,"
1494,PRESENT.,"Without one stealing sigh, a progeny"
1495,PRESENT.,"Of infants clustering round maternal knees,"
1496,PRESENT.,"Nor felt some boding fears, how they might fare"
1497,PRESENT.,"In the wide world, when they who loved them most"
1498,PRESENT.,Were silent in their graves!
1499,PRESENT.,"Nay! pass not on,                       80"
1500,PRESENT.,Till thou hast marked a book--the leaf turned down--
1501,PRESENT.,Night Thoughts on Death and Immortality!
1502,PRESENT.,"This book, my mother! in the weary hours"
1503,PRESENT.,"Of life, in every care, in every joy,"
1504,PRESENT.,"Was thy companion: next to God's own Word,"
1505,PRESENT.,"The book that bears this name,[22] thou didst revere,"
1506,PRESENT.,"Leaving a stain of tears upon the page,"
1507,PRESENT.,"Whose lessons, with a more emphatic truth,"
1508,PRESENT.,Touched thine own heart!
1509,PRESENT.,That heart has long been still!                        90
1510,PRESENT.,"But who is he, of aspect more severe,"
1511,PRESENT.,"Yet with a manly kindness in his mien,"
1512,PRESENT.,"He, who o'erlooks yon sturdy labourer"
1513,PRESENT.,Delving the glebe! My father as he lived!
1514,PRESENT.,"That father, and that mother, ""earth to earth,"
1515,PRESENT.,"And dust to dust,"" the inevitable doom"
1516,PRESENT.,"Hath long consigned! And where is he, the son,"
1517,PRESENT.,Whose future fate they pondered with a sigh?
1518,PRESENT.,"Long, nor unprosperous, has been his way"
1519,PRESENT.,"Through life's tumultuous scenes, who, when a child,              100"
1520,PRESENT.,Played in that garden platform in the sun;
1521,PRESENT.,"Or loitered o'er the common, and pursued"
1522,PRESENT.,"The colts among the sand-hills; or, intent"
1523,PRESENT.,"On hardier enterprise, his pumpkin-ship,"
1524,PRESENT.,"New-rigged, and buoyant, with its tiny sail,"
1525,PRESENT.,"Launched on the garden pond; or stretched his hand,"
1526,PRESENT.,"At once forgetting all this glorious toil,"
1527,PRESENT.,When the bright butterfly came wandering by.
1528,PRESENT.,"But never will that day pass from his mind,"
1529,PRESENT.,"When, scarcely breathing for delight, at Wells,                   110"
1530,PRESENT.,"He saw the horsemen of the clock[23] ride round,"
1531,PRESENT.,"As if for life; and ancient Blandifer,[24]"
1532,PRESENT.,"Seated aloft, like Hermes, in his chair"
1533,PRESENT.,"Complacent as when first he took his seat,"
1534,PRESENT.,"Some hundred years ago; saw him lift up,"
1535,PRESENT.,"As if old Time was cowering at his feet,"
1536,PRESENT.,"Solemn lift up his mace, and strike the bell,"
1537,PRESENT.,Himself for ever silent in his seat.
1538,PRESENT.,"How little thought I then, the hour would come,"
1539,PRESENT.,"When the loved prelate of that beauteous fane,                    120"
1540,PRESENT.,"At whose command I write, might placidly"
1541,PRESENT.,"Smile on this picture, in my future verse,                        122"
1542,PRESENT.,When Blandifer had struck so many hours
1543,PRESENT.,"For me, his poet, in this vale of years,"
1544,PRESENT.,Himself unchanged and solemn as of yore!
1545,PRESENT.,"My father was the pastor, and the friend"
1546,PRESENT.,"Of all who, living then--the scene is closed--"
1547,PRESENT.,"Now silent in that rocky churchyard sleep,"
1548,PRESENT.,The aged and the young! A village then
1549,PRESENT.,"Was not as villages are now. The hind,                            130"
1550,PRESENT.,"Who delved, or ""jocund drove his team a-field,"""
1551,PRESENT.,Had then an independence in his look
1552,PRESENT.,"And heart; and, plodding on his lowly path,"
1553,PRESENT.,"Disdained a parish dole, content, though poor."
1554,PRESENT.,He was the village monitor: he taught
1555,PRESENT.,"His children to be good, and read their book,"
1556,PRESENT.,"And in the gallery took his Sunday place,--"
1557,PRESENT.,"To-morrow, with the bee, to work."
1558,PRESENT.,So passed
1559,PRESENT.,"His days of cheerful, independent toil;                           140"
1560,PRESENT.,"And when the pastor came that way, at eve,"
1561,PRESENT.,He had a ready present for the child
1562,PRESENT.,Who read his book the best; and that poor child
1563,PRESENT.,"Remembered it, when, treading the same path"
1564,PRESENT.,"In which his father trod, he so grew up"
1565,PRESENT.,"Contented, till old Time had blanched his locks,"
1566,PRESENT.,And he was borne--whilst the bell tolled--to sleep
1567,PRESENT.,In the same churchyard where his father slept!
1568,PRESENT.,"His daughter walked content, and innocent"
1569,PRESENT.,"As lovely, in her lowly path. She turned                          150"
1570,PRESENT.,"The hour-glass, while the humming wheel went round,"
1571,PRESENT.,"Or went ""a-Maying"" o'er the fields in spring,"
1572,PRESENT.,"Leading her little brother by the hand,"
1573,PRESENT.,"Along the village lane, and o'er the stile,"
1574,PRESENT.,"To gather cowslips; and then home again,"
1575,PRESENT.,"To turn her wheel, contented, through the day.                    156"
1576,PRESENT.,"Or, singing low, bend where her brother slept,"
1577,PRESENT.,"Rocking the cradle, to ""sweet William's grave!""[25]"
1578,PRESENT.,"No lure could tempt her from the woodbine shed,"
1579,PRESENT.,"Where she grew up, and folded first her hands                     160"
1580,PRESENT.,In infant prayer: yet oft a tear would steal
1581,PRESENT.,"Down her young cheek, to think how desolate"
1582,PRESENT.,That home would be when her poor mother died;
1583,PRESENT.,"Still praying that she ne'er might cause a pain,"
1584,PRESENT.,"Undutiful, to ""bring down her gray hairs"
1585,PRESENT.,"With sorrow to the grave!"""
1586,PRESENT.,Now mark this scene!
1587,PRESENT.,The fuming factory's polluted air
1588,PRESENT.,"Has stained the country! See that rural nymph,"
1589,PRESENT.,An infant in her arms! She claims the dole                        170
1590,PRESENT.,"From the cold parish, which her faithless swain"
1591,PRESENT.,"Denies: he stands aloof, with clownish leer;"
1592,PRESENT.,The constable behind--and mark his brow--
1593,PRESENT.,"Beckons the nimble clerk; the justice, grave,"
1594,PRESENT.,"Turns from his book a moment, with a look"
1595,PRESENT.,"Of pity, signs the warrant for her pay,"
1596,PRESENT.,"A weekly eighteen pence; she, unabashed,"
1597,PRESENT.,"Slides from the room, and not a transient blush,"
1598,PRESENT.,"Far less the accusing tear, is on her cheek!"
1599,PRESENT.,A different scene comes next: That village maid                 180
1600,PRESENT.,"Approaches timidly, yet beautiful;"
1601,PRESENT.,"A tear is on her lids, when she looks down"
1602,PRESENT.,"Upon her sleeping child. Her heart was won,"
1603,PRESENT.,"The wedding-day was fixed, the ring was bought!"
1604,PRESENT.,'Tis the same story--Colin was untrue!
1605,PRESENT.,"He ruined, and then left her to her fate."
1606,PRESENT.,"Pity her, she has not a friend on earth,"
1607,PRESENT.,And that still tear speaks to all human hearts
1608,PRESENT.,"But his, whose cruelty and treachery                              189"
1609,PRESENT.,Caused it to flow! So crime still follows crime.
1610,PRESENT.,"Ask we the cause? See, where those engines heave,"
1611,PRESENT.,That spread their giant arms o'er all the land!
1612,PRESENT.,The wheel is silent in the vale! Old age
1613,PRESENT.,And youth are levelled by one parish law!
1614,PRESENT.,"Ask why that maid, all day, toils in the field,"
1615,PRESENT.,"Associate with the rude and ribald clown,"
1616,PRESENT.,Even in the shrinking April of her youth?
1617,PRESENT.,"To earn her loaf, and eat it by herself."
1618,PRESENT.,Parental love is smitten to the dust;
1619,PRESENT.,Over a little smoke the aged sire                                 200
1620,PRESENT.,Holds his pale hands--and the deserted hearth
1621,PRESENT.,Is cheerless as his heart: but Piety
1622,PRESENT.,Points to the Bible! Shut the book again:
1623,PRESENT.,"The ranter is the roving gospel now,"
1624,PRESENT.,And each his own apostle! Shut the book:
1625,PRESENT.,"A locust-swarm of tracts darken its light,"
1626,PRESENT.,And choke its utterance; while a Babel-rout
1627,PRESENT.,"Of mock-religionists, turn where we will,"
1628,PRESENT.,"Have drowned the small still voice, till Piety,"
1629,PRESENT.,"Sick of the din, retires to pray alone.                           210"
1630,PRESENT.,"But though abused Religion, and the dole"
1631,PRESENT.,"Of pauper-pay, and vomitories huge"
1632,PRESENT.,"Of smoke, are each a steam-engine of crime,"
1633,PRESENT.,"Polluting, far and wide, the wholesome air,"
1634,PRESENT.,"And withering life's green verdure underneath,"
1635,PRESENT.,Full many a poor and lowly flower of want
1636,PRESENT.,"Has Education nursed, like a pure rill,"
1637,PRESENT.,"Winding through desert glens, and bade it live"
1638,PRESENT.,To grace the cottage with its mantling sweets.
1639,PRESENT.,"There was a village girl, I knew her well,                        220"
1640,PRESENT.,From five years old and upwards; all her friends
1641,PRESENT.,"Were dead, and she was to the workhouse left,"
1642,PRESENT.,And there a witness to such sounds profane                        223
1643,PRESENT.,"As might turn virtue pale! When Sunday came,"
1644,PRESENT.,"Assembled with the children of the poor,"
1645,PRESENT.,"Upon the lawn of my own parsonage,"
1646,PRESENT.,She stood among them: they were taught to read
1647,PRESENT.,"In companies and groups, upon the green,"
1648,PRESENT.,Each with its little book; her lighted eyes
1649,PRESENT.,Shone beautiful where'er they turned; her form                    230
1650,PRESENT.,Was graceful; but her book her sole delight![26]
1651,PRESENT.,Instructed thus she went a serving-maid
1652,PRESENT.,"Into the neighbouring town,--ah! who shall guide"
1653,PRESENT.,"A friendless maid, so beautiful and young,"
1654,PRESENT.,From life's contagions! But she had been taught
1655,PRESENT.,"The duties of her humble lot, to pray"
1656,PRESENT.,"To God, and that one heavenly Father's eye"
1657,PRESENT.,"Was over rich and poor! On Sunday night,"
1658,PRESENT.,"She read her Bible, turning still away"
1659,PRESENT.,"From those who flocked, inflaming and inflamed,                   240"
1660,PRESENT.,To nightly meetings; but she never closed
1661,PRESENT.,"Her eyes, or raised them to the light of morn,"
1662,PRESENT.,"Without a prayer to Him who ""bade the sun"
1663,PRESENT.,"Go forth,"" a giant, from his eastern gate!"
1664,PRESENT.,"No art, no bribe, could lure her steps astray"
1665,PRESENT.,"From the plain path, and lessons she had learned,"
1666,PRESENT.,"A village child. She is a mother now,"
1667,PRESENT.,And lives to prove the blessings and the fruits
1668,PRESENT.,"Of moral duty, on the poorest child,"
1669,PRESENT.,"When duty, and when sober piety,                                  250"
1670,PRESENT.,"Impressing the young heart, go hand in hand."
1671,PRESENT.,No villager was then a disputant
1672,PRESENT.,In Calvinistic and contentious creeds;
1673,PRESENT.,"No pale mechanic, from a neighbouring sink"
1674,PRESENT.,"Of steam and rank debauchery and smoke,                           255"
1675,PRESENT.,"Crawled forth upon a Sunday morn, with looks"
1676,PRESENT.,"Saddening the very sunshine, to instruct"
1677,PRESENT.,The parish poor in evangelic lore;
1678,PRESENT.,"To teach them to cast off, ""as filthy rags,"""
1679,PRESENT.,"Good works! and listen to such ministers,                         260"
1680,PRESENT.,"Who all (be sure) ""are worthy of their hire;"""
1681,PRESENT.,"Who only preach for good of their poor souls,"
1682,PRESENT.,"That they may turn ""from darkness unto light,"""
1683,PRESENT.,"And, above all, fly, as the gates of hell,"
1684,PRESENT.,"Morality![27] and Baal's steeple house,"
1685,PRESENT.,"Where, without ""heart-work,"" Doctor Littlegrace"
1686,PRESENT.,"Drones his dull requiem to the snoring clerk!""[28]"
1687,PRESENT.,True; he who drawls his heartless homily
1688,PRESENT.,"For one day's work, and plods, on wading stilts,"
1689,PRESENT.,"Through prosing paragraphs, with inference,                       270"
1690,PRESENT.,"Methodically dull, as orthodox,"
1691,PRESENT.,Enforcing sagely that we all must die
1692,PRESENT.,"When God shall call--oh, what a pulpit drone"
1693,PRESENT.,"Is he! The blue fly might as well preach ""Hum,"""
1694,PRESENT.,"And ""so conclude!"""
1695,PRESENT.,But save me from the sight
1696,PRESENT.,"Of curate fop, half jockey and half clerk,"
1697,PRESENT.,"The tandem-driving Tommy of a town,"
1698,PRESENT.,"Disdaining books, omniscient of a horse,"
1699,PRESENT.,"Impatient till September comes again,                             280"
1700,PRESENT.,"Eloquent only of ""the pretty girl"
1701,PRESENT.,"With whom he danced last night!"" Oh! such a thing"
1702,PRESENT.,"Is worse than the dull doctor, who performs"
1703,PRESENT.,"Duly his stinted task, and then to sleep,"
1704,PRESENT.,Till Sunday asks another homily
1705,PRESENT.,"Against all innovations of the age,"
1706,PRESENT.,"Mad missionary zeal, and Bible clubs,                             287"
1707,PRESENT.,And Calvinists and Evangelicals!
1708,PRESENT.,"Yes! Evangelicals! Oh, glorious word!"
1709,PRESENT.,But who deserves that awful name? Not he
1710,PRESENT.,Who spits his puny Puritanic spite
1711,PRESENT.,On harmless recreation; who reviles
1712,PRESENT.,"All who, majestic in their distant scorn,"
1713,PRESENT.,Bear on in silence their calm Christian course.
1714,PRESENT.,He only is the Evangelical
1715,PRESENT.,"Who holds in equal scorn dogmas and dreams,"
1716,PRESENT.,"The Shibboleth of saintly magazines,"
1717,PRESENT.,Decked with most grim and godly visages;
1718,PRESENT.,"The cobweb sophistry, or the dark code"
1719,PRESENT.,"Of commentators, who, with loathsome track,                       300"
1720,PRESENT.,"Crawl o'er a text, or on the lucid page,"
1721,PRESENT.,"Beaming with heavenly love and God's own light,"
1722,PRESENT.,Sit like a nightmare![29] Soon a deadly mist
1723,PRESENT.,"Creeps o'er our eyes and heart, till angel forms"
1724,PRESENT.,"Turn into hideous phantoms, mocking us,"
1725,PRESENT.,Even when we look for comfort at the spring
1726,PRESENT.,"And well of life, while dismal voices cry,"
1727,PRESENT.,Death! Reprobation! Woe! Eternal woe!
1728,PRESENT.,He only is the Evangelical
1729,PRESENT.,Who from the human commentary turns                               310
1730,PRESENT.,"With tranquil scorn, and nearer to his heart"
1731,PRESENT.,"Presses the Bible, till repentant tears,"
1732,PRESENT.,"In silence, wet his cheek, and new-born faith,"
1733,PRESENT.,"And hope, and charity, with radiant smile,"
1734,PRESENT.,"Visit his heart,--all pointing to the cross!"
1735,PRESENT.,"He only is the Evangelical,                                     316"
1736,PRESENT.,"Who, with eyes fixed upon that spectacle,"
1737,PRESENT.,"Christ and him crucified, with ardent hope,"
1738,PRESENT.,"And holier feelings, lifts his thoughts from earth,"
1739,PRESENT.,"And cries, My Father! Meantime, his whole heart                   320"
1740,PRESENT.,"Is on God's Word: he preaches Faith, and Hope,"
1741,PRESENT.,"And Charity,--these three, and not that one!"
1742,PRESENT.,"And Charity, the greatest of these three![30]"
1743,PRESENT.,Give me an Evangelical like this! But now
1744,PRESENT.,The blackest crimes in tract-religion's code
1745,PRESENT.,"Are moral virtues! Spare the prodigal,--"
1746,PRESENT.,"He may awake when God shall ""call;"" but, hell,"
1747,PRESENT.,"Roll thy avenging flames, to swallow up"
1748,PRESENT.,The son who never left his father's home

1750,PRESENT.,"Let him not lay the unction to his soul,"
1751,PRESENT.,That his upbraiding conscience tells no tale
1752,PRESENT.,"At that dread hour; bid him confess his sin,"
1753,PRESENT.,"The greater that, with humble hope, he looks"
1754,PRESENT.,Back on a well-spent life! Bid him confess
1755,PRESENT.,"That he hath broken all God's holy laws,--"
1756,PRESENT.,"In vain hath he done justly,--loved, in vain,"
1757,PRESENT.,"Mercy, and hath walked humbly with his God!"
1758,PRESENT.,"These are mere works; but faith is everything,"
1759,PRESENT.,And all in all! The Christian code contains                       340
1760,PRESENT.,"No ""if"" or ""but!""[31] Let tabernacles ring,"
1761,PRESENT.,"And churches too,[32] with sanctimonious strains"
1762,PRESENT.,Baneful as these; and let such strains be heard
1763,PRESENT.,"Through half the land; and can we shut our eyes,"
1764,PRESENT.,"And, sadly wondering, ask the cause of crimes,                    345"
1765,PRESENT.,"When infidelity stands lowering here,"
1766,PRESENT.,"With open scorn, and such a code as this,"
1767,PRESENT.,"So baneful, withers half the charities"
1768,PRESENT.,Of human hearts! Oh! dear is Mercy's voice
1769,PRESENT.,"To man, a mourner in the vale of sin                              350"
1770,PRESENT.,"And death: how dear the still small voice of Faith,"
1771,PRESENT.,That bids him raise his look beyond the clouds
1772,PRESENT.,That hang o'er this dim earth; but he who tears
1773,PRESENT.,"Faith from her heavenly sisterhood, denies"
1774,PRESENT.,"The gospel, and turns traitor to the cause"
1775,PRESENT.,"He has engaged to plead. Come, Faith, and Hope,"
1776,PRESENT.,"And Charity! how dear to the sad heart,"
1777,PRESENT.,The consolations and the glorious views

1784,PRESENT.,"Who deems the Almighty frowns upon his throne,"
1785,PRESENT.,"Because two pair of harmless dowagers,"
1786,PRESENT.,"Whose life has passed without a stain, beguile"
1787,PRESENT.,An evening hour with cards; who deems that hell

1797,PRESENT.,"My pity, my aversion, and my scorn."
1798,PRESENT.,"Cry aloud!--Oh, speak in thunder to the soul                    379"
1799,PRESENT.,That sleeps in sin! Harrow the inmost heart
1800,PRESENT.,"Of murderous intent, till dew-drops stand"
1801,PRESENT.,"Upon his haggard brow! Call conscience up,"
1802,PRESENT.,"Like a stern spectre, whose dim finger points"
1803,PRESENT.,To dark misdeeds of yore! Wither the arm
1804,PRESENT.,"Of the oppressor, at whose feet the slave"
1805,PRESENT.,"Crouches, and pleading lifts his fettered hands!"
1806,PRESENT.,Thou violator of the innocent
1807,PRESENT.,"Hide thee! Hence! hide thee in the deepest cave,"
1808,PRESENT.,From man's indignant sight! Thou hypocrite!
1809,PRESENT.,"Trample in dust thy mask, nor cry faith, faith,                   390"
1810,PRESENT.,"Making it but a hollow tinkling sound,"

2129,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"thought it best to add for the sake of moral, picturesque, and"
2130,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,poetical effect. The narrative is as follows:--
2131,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2132,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"""October, 1780. Thomas Thomas, aged 37. This man died of mental"
2133,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"anguish, or what is called a broken heart. He lived in the village"
2134,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"of Drannock, in the parish of Gwinnear, till an unhappy event"
2135,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"occurred, which proved fatal to his peace of mind for more than"
2136,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"eight years, and finally occasioned his death. He courted Elizabeth"
2137,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Thomas, of the same village, who was his first-cousin; and it was"

2139,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"May 1772, some little disagreement having happened between them,"
2140,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"he, out of resentment, or from some other motive, paid great"
2141,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"attention to another girl; and on Sunday the 31st of that month, in"
2142,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"the afternoon, accompanied her to the Methodist meeting at Wall."
2143,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"During their absence, the slighted female, who was very beautiful"
2144,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"in her person, but of an extremely irritable temper, took a rope"
2145,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"and a common prayer-book, in which she had folded down the 109th"
2146,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Psalm, and, going into an adjacent field, hanged herself. Thomas,"
2147,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"on his return from the preaching, inquired for Betsy; and being"
2148,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"told she had not been seen for two or three hours, he exclaimed,"
2149,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,'Good God! she has destroyed herself!' which apprehension seems to
2150,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"show, either that she had threatened to commit suicide in"
2151,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"consequence of his desertion, or that he dreaded it from a"
2152,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,knowledge of the violence of her disposition. But when he saw that
2153,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"his fears were realised, and had read the psalm, so full of"
2154,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"execrations, which she had pointed out to him, he cried out, 'I am"
2155,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,ruined for ever and ever!' The very sight of this village and
2156,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"neighbourhood was now become insupportable, and he went to live at"
2157,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Marazion, hoping that a change of scene and social intercourse"
2158,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,might expel those excruciating reflections which harrowed up his
2159,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"very soul, or at least render them less acute; but in this he"
2160,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"appeared to be mistaken, for he found himself closely pursued by"
2161,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,the evil demon
2162,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2163,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"'Despair, whose torments no man, sure,"
2164,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,But lovers and the damned endure.'
2165,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2166,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"""To hear the 109th Psalm would petrify him with horror, and"
2167,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,therefore he would not attend divine service on the 22d day of the
2168,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"month; he dreaded to go near a reading school, lest he should hear"
2169,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,the dreaded lesson. Whatever misfortunes befel him (and these were
2170,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"not a few, for he was several times hurt, and even maimed, in the"
2171,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"mines in which he laboured), he still attributed them all to the"
2172,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"malevolent agency of the deceased, and thought he could find"
2173,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,allusions to the whole in the calamitous legacy which she had
2174,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"bequeathed him. When he slumbered, for he knew nothing of sound"
2175,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"sleep, the injured girl appeared to his imagination, with such a"
2176,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"countenance as she retained after the rash action, and the"
2177,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"prayer-book in her hand, open at the hateful psalm; and he was"
2178,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"frequently heard to cry out, 'Oh, my dear Betsy, shut the book,"
2179,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"shut the book!' _etc._ With a mind so disturbed and deranged,"
2180,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,though he could not reasonably expect much consolation from
2181,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"matrimony, yet imagining that the cares of a family might distract"
2182,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,his thoughts from the miserable subject by which he was harassed
2183,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"both by day and night, he successively paid his addresses to many"
2184,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"girls of Marazion; but they indignantly flew from him, and with a"
2185,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"sneer asked him, whether he was desirous of bringing all the curses"
2186,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"in the 109th Psalm on their heads? At length, however, he succeeded"
2187,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,with one who had less superstition and more fortitude than the
2188,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"rest, and he led her to St Hilary church, to be married, January"
2189,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"21, 1778; but on the road thither, they were overtaken by a sudden"
2190,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"and violent hurricane, such as those which not unfrequently happen"
2191,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"in the vicinity of Mount's Bay; and he, suspecting that poor Betsy"
2192,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"rode the whirlwind and directed the storm, was convulsed with"
2193,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"terror, and was literally 'coupled with fear.' Such is the power of"
2194,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,conscious guilt to impute accidental occurrences to the hand of
2195,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"vindictive justice, and so true is the observation of the poet,"
2196,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2197,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,'Judicium metuit sibi mens mali conscia justum.'
2198,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2199,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"""He lived long enough to have a son and a daughter; but the"
2200,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"corrosive worm within his breast preyed upon his vitals, and at"
2201,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"length consumed all the powers of his body, as it had long before"
2202,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"destroyed the tranquillity of his mind, and he was released from"
2203,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"all his pangs, both mental and corporeal, on Friday, October 20,"
2204,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"1780, and buried at St Hilary, the Sunday following, during evening"
2205,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"service."""
2206,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2207,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book!"
2208,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"So William cried, with wild and frantic look."
2209,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"She whom he loved was in her shroud, nor pain"
2210,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Nor grief can visit her sad heart again.
2211,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,There is no sculptured tombstone at her head;                       5
2212,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,No rude memorial marks her lowly bed:
2213,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The village children, every holiday,"
2214,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Round the green turf, in summer sunshine play;"
2215,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And none, but those now bending to the tomb,"
2216,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Remember Mary, lovely in her bloom!                                10"
2217,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Yet oft the hoary swain, when autumn sighs"
2218,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Through the long grass, sees a dim form arise,"
2219,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"That hies in glimmering moonlight to the brook,"
2220,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Its wan lips moving, in its hand a book."
2221,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"So, like a bruised flower, and in the pride"
2222,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of youth and beauty, injured Mary died."
2223,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"William some years survived, but years no trace"
2224,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Of his sick heart's deep anguish could erase.
2225,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Still the dread spectre seemed to rise, and, worse,"
2226,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Still in his ears rang the appalling curse!                        20
2227,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"While loud he cries, despair upon his look,"
2228,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Oh! shut the book, my Mary, shut the book!"
2229,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The sun is slowly westering now, and lo,"
2230,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"How beautiful steals out the humid bow,"
2231,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A radiant arch! Listen, whilst I relate"
2232,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"William's dread judgment, and poor Mary's fate."
2233,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"I think I see the pine, that, heavily"
2234,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Swaying, yet seems as for the dead to sigh."
2235,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"How many generations, since the day"
2236,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of its green pride, have passed, like leaves, away!                30"
2237,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,How many children of the hamlet played
2238,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Round its hoar trunk, who at its feet were laid,"
2239,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Withered and gray old men! In life's first bloom
2240,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,How many has it seen borne to the tomb!
2241,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,But never one so sunk in hopeless woe
2242,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,As she who lies in the cold grave below.
2243,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her Sabbath-book, from which at church she prayed,"
2244,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Was her poor father's, in that churchyard laid:"
2245,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"For Mary grew as beautiful in youth,                               39"
2246,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,As taught at church the lore of heavenly truth.
2247,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"What different passions in her bosom strove,"
2248,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,When first she heard the tale of village love!
2249,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The youth whose voice then won her partial ear,"
2250,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A yeoman's son, had passed his twentieth year;"
2251,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"She scarce eighteen: her mother, with the care"
2252,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of boding age, oft whispered, Oh, beware!"
2253,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"For William was a thoughtless youth, and wild,"
2254,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And like a colt unbroken, from a child:"
2255,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"At length, if not to serious thoughts awake,"
2256,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He came to church, at least for Mary's sake.                       50"
2257,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Young Mary, while her father was alive,"
2258,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Saw all things round the humble dwelling thrive;
2259,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her widowed mother now was growing old,"
2260,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And bit by bit their worldly goods were sold:
2261,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Mary remained, her mother's hope and pride!"
2262,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"How oft when she was sleeping by her side,"
2263,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"That mother waked, and kissed her cheek, with tears"
2264,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Praying for blessings on her future years,--"
2265,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When she, her mother, earthly trials o'er,"
2266,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Should rest in the cold grave, to grieve no more!                  60"
2267,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"But Mary to love's dream her heart resigned,"
2268,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And gave to fancy all her youthful mind.
2269,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Shall I describe her! Didst thou never mark
2270,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A soft blue light, beneath eye-lashes dark?"
2271,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Such was her eye's soft light;--her chestnut hair,"
2272,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Light as she tripped, waved lighter to the air;"
2273,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And, with her prayer-book, when on Sunday dressed,"
2274,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her looks a sweet but lowly grace expressed,"
2275,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,As modest as the violet at her breast.
2276,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Sometimes all day by her lone mother's side                        70
2277,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"She sat, and oft would turn, a tear to hide."
2278,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Where winds the brook, by yonder bordering wood,                 72"
2279,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Her mother's solitary cottage stood:
2280,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A few white pales in front, fenced from the road"
2281,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The garden-plot, and poor but neat abode."
2282,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Before the window, 'mid the flowers of spring"
2283,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A bee-hive hummed, whose bees were murmuring;"
2284,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Beneath an ivied bank, abrupt and high,"
2285,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A small clear well reflected bank and sky,"
2286,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"In whose translucent mirror, smooth and still,                     80"
2287,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"From time to time, a small bird dipped its bill."
2288,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Here the first bluebell, and, of livelier hue,"
2289,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The daffodil and polyanthus grew.
2290,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,'Twas Mary's care a jessamine to train.
2291,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"With small white blossoms, round the window-pane:"
2292,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A rustic wicket opened to the meads,"
2293,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Where a scant pathway to the hamlet leads:
2294,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And near, a water-wheel toiled round and round,"
2295,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Dashing the o'ershot stream, with long continuous sound."
2296,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Beyond, when the brief shower had sailed away,                     90"
2297,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The tapering spire shone out in sunlight gray;
2298,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And o'er that mountain's northern point, to sight"
2299,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Stretching far on, the main-sea rolled in light."
2300,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Enter: within, see everything how neat!"
2301,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"One book lies open on the window-seat,"
2302,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The spectacles are on a leaf of Job:
2303,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"There, mark, a map of the terrestrial globe;"
2304,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And opposite, with its prolific stem,"
2305,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The Christian's tree, and New Jerusalem;[50]"
2306,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Here, see a printed paper, to record                              100"
2307,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,A veritable letter from our Lord:[51]
2308,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Two books are on the window-ledge beneath,--"
2309,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The Book of Prayer, and Drelincourt on Death:"
2310,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Some cowslips, in a cup of china placed,                          104"
2311,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,A painted shelf above the chimney graced:
2312,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Grown like its mistress old, with half-shut eyes,"
2313,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Save when, at times, awaked by wandering flies,"
2314,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Tib[52] in the sunshine of the casement lies.
2315,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"'Twas spring time now, with birds the garden rung,"
2316,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And Mary's linnet at the window sung.                             110
2317,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Whilst in the air the vernal music floats,"
2318,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The cuckoo only joins his two sweet notes:[53]
2319,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"But those--oh! listen, for he sings more near--"
2320,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"So musical, so mellow, and so clear!"
2321,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Not sweeter, where thy mighty waters sweep,"
2322,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Missouri, through the night of forests deep,"
2323,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Resounds, from glade to glade, from rock to hill,"
2324,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"While fervent harmonies the wild wood fill,"
2325,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The solitary note of ""whip-poor-will;""[54]"
2326,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Mary's old mother stops her wheel to say,                         120"
2327,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The cuckoo! hark! how sweet he sings to-day!
2328,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"It is not long, not long to Whitsuntide,"
2329,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And Mary then shall be a happy bride.
2330,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"On Sunday morn, when a slant light was flung"
2331,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Upon the tower, and the first peal was rung,"
2332,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"William and Mary smiling would repair,"
2333,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Arm linked in arm, to the same house of prayer."
2334,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The bells will sound more merrily, he cried,"
2335,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And gently pressed her hand, at Whitsuntide:"
2336,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"She checked the rising thoughts, and hung her head;               130"
2337,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And Mary, ere one year had passed--was dead!"
2338,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"'Twas said, and many would the tale believe,"
2339,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her shrouded form was seen upon that eve,[55]"
2340,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When, gliding through the churchyard, they appear--               134"
2341,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,They who shall die within the coming year.
2342,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"All pale, and strangely piteous, was her look,"
2343,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her right hand was stretched out, and held a book;"
2344,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"O'er it her wet hair dripped, while the moon cast"
2345,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A cold wan light, as in her shroud she passed!"
2346,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"I cannot say if this were so, but late,                           140"
2347,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"She went to Madern-stone,[56] to learn her fate,"
2348,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,What there she heard ne'er came to human ears--
2349,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,But from that hour she oft was seen in tears.
2350,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Mild zephyr breathes, the butterfly more bright"
2351,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Strays, wavering, o'er the pales, in rainbow light;"
2352,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The lamb, the colt, the blackbird in the brake,"
2353,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Seem all the vernal feeling to partake;
2354,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The lark sings high in air, itself unseen,"
2355,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The hasty swallow skims the village-green;
2356,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And all things seem, to the full heart, to bring                  150"
2357,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The blissful breathings of the world's first spring.
2358,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,How lovely is the sunshine of May-morn!
2359,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The garden bee has wound his earliest horn,"
2360,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Busied from flower to flower, as he would say,"
2361,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Up! Mary! up this merry morn of May!
2362,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Now lads and lasses of the hamlet bore
2363,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Branches of blossomed thorn or sycamore;[57]
2364,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And at her mother's porch a garland hung,"
2365,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,While thus their rural roundelay they sung:--
2366,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2367,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,*       *       *       *       *
2368,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2369,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And we were up as soon as day,[58]                                160"
2370,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"To fetch the summer home,"
2371,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The summer and the radiant May,                                   162"
2372,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,For summer now is come.
2373,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2374,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"In Madern vale the bell-flowers bloom,[59]"
2375,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And wave to Zephyr's breath:
2376,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The cuckoo sings in Morval Coombe,"
2377,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Where nods the purple heath.[60]
2378,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2379,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Come, dance around Glen-Aston tree--"
2380,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"We bring a garland gay,"
2381,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And Mary of Guynear shall be                                      170
2382,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Our Lady of the May.
2383,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2384,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"But where is William? Did he not declare,"
2385,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He would be first the blossomed bough to bear!
2386,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She will not join the train! and see! the flower
2387,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She gathered now is fading! Hour by hour
2388,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She watched the sunshine on the thatch; again
2389,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her mother turns the hour-glass; now, the pane"
2390,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The westering sun has left--the long May-day
2391,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,So Mary wore in hopes and fears away.
2392,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Slow twilight steals. By the small garden gate                    180
2393,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She stands: Oh! William never came so late!
2394,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her mother's voice is heard: Good child, come in;"
2395,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Dream not of bliss on earth--it is a sin:
2396,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Come, take the Bible down, my child, and read;"
2397,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"In sickness, and in sorrow, and in need,"
2398,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"By friends forsaken, and by fears oppressed,"
2399,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,_There_ only can the weary heart find rest.
2400,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her thin hands, marked by many a wandering vein,"
2401,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Her mother turned the silent glass again;
2402,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The rushlight now is lit, the Bible read,                         190"
2403,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Yet, ere sad Mary can retire to bed,"
2404,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"She listens!--Hark! no voice, no step she hears,--"
2405,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Oh! seek thy bed to hide those bursting tears!
2406,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When the slow morning came, the tale was told,"
2407,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,(Need it have been?) that William's love was cold.
2408,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"But hope yet whispers, dry the accusing tear,--"
2409,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When Sunday comes, he will again be here!"
2410,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And Sunday came, and struggling from a cloud."
2411,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The sun shone bright--the bells were chiming loud--
2412,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And lads and lasses, in their best attire,                        200"
2413,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Were tripping past--the youth, the child, the sire;"
2414,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,But William came not. With a boding heart
2415,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Poor Mary saw the Sunday crowd depart:
2416,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And when her mother came, with kerchief clean,"
2417,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The last who tottered homeward o'er the green,"
2418,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Mary, to hear no more of peace on earth,"
2419,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Retired in silence to the lonely hearth.
2420,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Next day the tidings to the cottage came,"
2421,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,That William's heart confessed another flame:
2422,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"That, with the bailiff's daughter he was seen,                    210"
2423,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,At the new tabernacle on the green;
2424,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,That cold and wayward falsehood made him prove
2425,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Alike a traitor to his faith and love.

2427,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,*       *       *       *       *
2428,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2429,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The bells are ringing, it is Whitsuntide,--"
2430,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And there goes faithless William with his bride.
2431,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Turn from the sight, poor Mary! Day by day,"
2432,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The dread remembrance wore her heart away:
2433,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Untimely sorrow sat upon her cheek,"
2434,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And her too trusting heart was left to break.
2435,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Six melancholy months have slowly passed,                       220"
2436,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And dark is heard November's hollow blast.
2437,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Sometimes, with tearful moodiness she smiled,                     222"
2438,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Then, still and placid looked, as when a child,"
2439,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Or raised her eyes disconsolate and wild.
2440,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Oft, as she strayed the brook's green marge along,"
2441,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She there would sing one sad and broken song:--
2442,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2443,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Lay me where the willows wave,[61]"
2444,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,In the cold moonlight;
2445,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Shine upon my lowly grave,"
2446,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Sadly, stars of night!                                          230"
2447,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2448,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"I to you would fly for rest,"
2449,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"But a stone, a stone,"
2450,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Lies like lead upon my breast,"
2451,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And every hope is flown.
2452,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2453,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Lay me where the willows wave,"
2454,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,In the cold moonlight;
2455,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Shine upon my lowly grave,"
2456,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Sadly, stars of night!"
2457,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2458,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her mother said, Thou shalt not be confined,"
2459,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Poor maid, for thou art harmless, and thy mind                    240"
2460,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The air may soothe, as fitfully it blows,"
2461,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Whispering forgetfulness, if not repose."
2462,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,So Mary wandered to the northern shore;[62]
2463,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,There oft she heard the gaunt Tregagel roar
2464,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Among the rocks; and when the tempest blew,"
2465,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And, like the shivered foam, her long hair flew,"
2466,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And all the billowy space was tossing wide,"
2467,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Rock on! thou melancholy main, she cried,"
2468,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"I love thy voice, oh, ever-sounding sea,                          249"
2469,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Nor heed this sad world while I look on thee!
2470,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Then on the surge she gazed, with vacant stare,"
2471,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Or tripping with wild fennel in her hair,[63]"
2472,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Sang merrily: Oh! we must dry the tear,"
2473,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"For Mab, the queen of fairies, will be here,--"
2474,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"William, she shall know all!--and then again"
2475,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Her ditty died into its first sad strain:--
2476,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2477,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Lay me where the willows wave,"
2478,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,In the cold moonlight;
2479,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Shine upon my lowly grave,"
2480,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Sadly, stars of night!                                          260"
2481,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2482,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When home returned, the tears ran down apace;"
2483,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She looked in silence in her mother's face;
2484,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Then, starting up, with wilder aspect cried,"
2485,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"How happy shall we be at Whitsuntide,"
2486,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Then, mother, I shall be a bride--a bride!"
2487,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Ah! some dire thought seems in her breast to rise,"
2488,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Stern with terrific joy she rolls her eyes:
2489,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her mother heeded not; nor when she took,"
2490,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"With more impatient haste, her Sunday book,"
2491,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She heeded not--for age had dimmed her sight.                     270
2492,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Her mother now is left alone: 'tis night.
2493,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Mary! poor Mary! her sad mother cried,"
2494,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Mary! my Mary!--but no voice replied.
2495,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,
2496,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Next morn, light-hearted William passed along,"
2497,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And careless hummed a desultory song,"
2498,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Bound to St Ives' revel.[64] Not a ray
2499,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Yet streaked the pale dawn of the dubious day;
2500,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The sun is yet below the hills: but, look!                        278"
2501,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"There is the tower--the mill--the stile--the brook,--"
2502,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And there is Mary's cottage! All is still!
2503,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Listen! no sound is heard but of the mill.
2504,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"'Tis true, the toils of day are not begun,"
2505,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,But Mary always rose before the sun.
2506,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Still at the door, a leafless relic now,"
2507,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Appeared a remnant of the May-day bough;
2508,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"No hour-glass, in the window, tells the hours:"
2509,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Where is poor Mary, where her book, her flowers?"
2510,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Ah! was it fancy?--as he passed along,"
2511,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He thought he heard a spirit's feeble song.[65]
2512,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Struck by the thrilling sound, he turned his look.                290"
2513,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Upon the ground there lay an open book;
2514,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,One page was folded down:--Spirit of grace!
2515,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"See! there are soils, like tear-blots, on the place!"
2516,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,It is a prayer-book! Soon these words he read;
2517,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Let him be desolate, and beg his bread![66]"
2518,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Let there be none, not one, on earth to bless,--"
2519,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Be his days few,--his children fatherless,--"
2520,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,His wife a widow!--let there be no friend
2521,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,In his last moments mercy to extend!
2522,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,It was a prayer-book he before had seen:                        300
2523,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Where? when? Once more, wild terror on his mien,"
2524,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He read the page:--An outcast let him lie,"
2525,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And unlamented and forsaken die!
2526,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When he has children, may they pine away"
2527,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Before his sight,--his wife to grief a prey."
2528,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Ah! 'tis poor Mary's book!--the very same                         306
2529,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He read with her at church; and, lo! her name:--"
2530,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"_The book of Mary Banks;--when this you see,"
2531,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And I am dead and gone, remember me!_"
2532,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He trembles: mark!--the dew is on his brow:
2533,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The curse is hers! he cried--I feel it now!
2534,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"I see already, even at my right hand,"
2535,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Dead Mary, thy accusing spirit stand!"
2536,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"I feel thy deep, last curse! Then, with a cry,"
2537,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He sunk upon the earth in agony.
2538,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Feebly he rose,--when, on the matted hair"
2539,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of a drowned maid, and on her bosom bare,"
2540,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The sun shone out; how horrid, the first glance"
2541,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of sunlight, on that altered countenance!"
2542,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The eyes were open, but though cold and dim,                      320"
2543,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Fixed with accusing ghastliness on him!
2544,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Merciful God! with faltering voice he cries,"
2545,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Hide me! oh, hide me from the sight! Those eyes--"
2546,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"They glare on me! oh, hide me with the dead!"
2547,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The curse, the deep curse rests upon my head!"
2548,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Alas, poor maid! 'twas frenzy fired thy breast,"
2549,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Which prompted horrors not to be expressed:
2550,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Whilst ever at thy side the foul fiend stood,"
2551,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And, laughing, pointed to the oblivious flood."
2552,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"William, heart-stricken, to despair a prey,                     330"
2553,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Soon left the village, journeying far away."
2554,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"For, as if Mary's ghost in judgment cried,"
2555,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"His wife, in the first pains of child-birth, died."
2556,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Who has not heard, St Cuthbert, of thy well?"
2557,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Perhaps the spirit may his fortunes tell.[67]
2558,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He dropped a pebble--mark! no bubble bright                       336
2559,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Comes from the bottom--turn away thy sight!
2560,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He looks again: O God! those eye-balls glare
2561,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"How terribly! Ah, smooth that matted hair!"
2562,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Mary! dear Mary! thy cold corse I see                             340
2563,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Rise from the fountain! Look not thus at me!
2564,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"I cannot bear the sight, that form, that look!"
2565,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book!"
2566,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Meantime, poor Mary in the grave was laid;--"
2567,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Her lone and gray-haired mother wept and prayed:
2568,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Soon to the dust she followed; and, unknown,"
2569,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,There they both rest without a name or stone.
2570,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The village maids, who pass in summer by,"
2571,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Still stop and say one prayer, for charity!"
2572,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,But what of William? Hide me in the mine!                       350
2573,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He cried, the beams of day insulting shine!"
2574,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Earth's very shadows are too gay, too bright,--"
2575,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Hide me for ever in forgetful night!
2576,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"In vain--that form, the cause of all his woes,"
2577,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,More sternly terrible in darkness rose!
2578,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Nearer he saw, with its pale waving hand,"
2579,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The phantom in appalling stillness stand;
2580,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The letters of the book shone through the night,"
2581,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"More blasting! Hide, oh hide me from the sight!"
2582,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Ocean, to thee and to thy storms I bring                          360"
2583,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A heart, that not the music of the spring,"
2584,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Nor summer piping on the rural plain,"
2585,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Shall ever wake to happiness again!
2586,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Ocean, be mine,--wild as thy wastes, to roam"
2587,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"From clime to clime!--Ocean, be thou my home!"
2588,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Some say he died: here he was seen no more;
2589,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He went to sea; and oft, amid the roar"
2590,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of the wild waters, starting from his sleep,"
2591,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He gazed upon the wild tempestuous deep;
2592,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When, slowly rising from the vessel's lee,                        370"
2593,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A shape appeared, which none besides could see;"
2594,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Then would he shriek, like one whom Heaven forsook,"
2595,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Oh! shut the book, dear Mary, shut the book!"
2596,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"In foreign lands, in darkness or in light,"
2597,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The same dread spectre stood before his sight;
2598,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"If slumber came his aching lids to close,"
2599,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Funereal forms in long procession rose.
2600,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Sometimes he dreamed that every grief was past
2601,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Mary, long lost on earth, is found at last;"
2602,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And now she smiled as when, in early life,                        380"
2603,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,She lived in hope that she should be his wife;
2604,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The maids are dressed in white, and all are gay,"
2605,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,For this (he dreamed) is Mary's wedding-day!
2606,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Then wherefore sad? a chill comes o'er his soul,--"
2607,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The sounds of mirth are hushed; and, hark! a toll!--"
2608,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A slow, deep toll; and lo! a sable train"
2609,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of mourners, moving to the village fane."
2610,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"A coffin now is laid in holy ground,"
2611,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"That, heavily, returns a hollow sound,"
2612,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,When the first earth upon its lid is thrown:                      390
2613,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,That hollow sound now changes to a groan:
2614,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"While, rising with wan cheek, and dripping hair,"
2615,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And moving lips, and eyes of ghastly glare,"
2616,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The spectre comes again! It comes more near!
2617,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,'Tis Mary! and that book with many a tear
2618,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Is wet, which, with dim fingers, long and cold,"
2619,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He sees her to the glimmering moon unfold.
2620,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And now her hand is laid upon his heart.
2621,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Gasping, he wakes--with a convulsive start,"
2622,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He gazes round! Moonlight is on the tide--                        400
2623,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The passing keel is scarcely heard to glide,--"
2624,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,See where the spectre goes! with frenzied look
2625,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He shrieks again, Oh! Mary, shut the book!"
2626,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Now, to the ocean's verge the phantom flies,--                    404"
2627,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And, hark! far off, the lessening laughter dies."
2628,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Years passed away,--at night, or evening close,"
2629,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Faint, and more faint, the accusing spectre rose."
2630,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Restored from toil and perils of the main,"
2631,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Now William treads his native place again.
2632,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Near the Land's-end, upon the rudest shore,                       410"
2633,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Where, from the west, Atlantic surges roar,"
2634,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He lived, a lonely stranger, sad, but mild;"
2635,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"All marked his sadness, chiefly when he smiled;"
2636,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Some competence he gained, by years of toil:"
2637,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"So, in a cottage, on his native soil,"
2638,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He dwelt, remote from crowds, nor told his tale"
2639,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,To human ear: he saw the white clouds sail
2640,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Oft o'er the bay,[68] when suns of summer shone,"
2641,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Yet still he wandered, muttering and alone."
2642,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"At night, when, like the tumult of the tide,                      420"
2643,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Sinking to sad repose, all trouble died,"
2644,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The book of God was on his pillow laid,"
2645,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He wept upon it, and in secret prayed."
2646,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He had no friend on earth, save one blue jay,[69]"
2647,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Which, from the Mississippi, far away,"
2648,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"O'er the Atlantic, to his native land"
2649,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He brought;--and this poor bird fed from his hand.
2650,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,In the great world there was not one beside
2651,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"For whom he cared, since his own mother died."
2652,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Yet manly strength was his, for twenty-years                    430"
2653,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Weighed light upon his frame, though passed in tears;"
2654,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"His age not forty-two, and in his face"
2655,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Of care more than of age appeared the trace.
2656,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Mary was scarce remembered; by degrees,"
2657,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The sights and sounds of life began to please.
2658,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Ruth was a widow, who, in youth, had known                      436"
2659,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Griefs of the heart, and losses of her own."
2660,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"She, patient, mild, compassionate, and kind,"
2661,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,First woke to human sympathies his mind.
2662,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He looked affectionately, when her child                          440"
2663,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Caressed his bird, and then he stood and smiled."
2664,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"This widow and her child, almost unknown,"
2665,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Lived in a cottage that adjoined his own.
2666,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Her husband was a fisher, one whose life"
2667,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Is fraught with terror to an anxious wife:
2668,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Night after night exposed upon the main;
2669,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Returning, tired with toil, or drenched with rain;"
2670,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"His gains, uncertain as his life; he knows"
2671,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,No stated hours of labour and repose.
2672,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"When others to a cheerful home retire,                            450"
2673,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And his wife sits before the evening fire,"
2674,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"He, rocking in the dark, tempestuous night,"
2675,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Haply is thinking of that social light.
2676,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Ruth's husband left the bay, the wind and rain"
2677,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Came down, the tempest swept the howling main;"
2678,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"The boat sank in the storm, and he was found,"
2679,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Below the rocks of the dark Lizard, drowned."
2680,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Seven years had passed, and after evening prayer,"
2681,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"To William's cottage Ruth would oft repair,"
2682,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And with her little son would sometimes stay,                     460"
2683,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Listening to tales of regions far away.
2684,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,The wondering boy loved of those scenes to hear--
2685,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Of battles--of the roving buccaneer--
2686,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of the wild hunters, in the forest-glen,"
2687,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"And fires, and dances of the savage men."
2688,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"So William spoke of perils he had passed,--"
2689,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Of voices heard amid the roaring blast;
2690,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Of those who, lonely and of hope bereft,"
2691,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Upon some melancholy rock are left,"
2692,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Who mark, despairing, at the close of day,                        470"
2693,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Perhaps, some far-off vessel sail away."
2694,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,He spoke with pity of the land of slaves--
2695,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,And of the phantom-ship that rides the waves.[70]
2696,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,It comes! it comes! A melancholy light
2697,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Gleams from the prow upon the storm of night.
2698,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,'Tis here! 'tis there! In vain the billows roll;
2699,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"It steers right on, but not a living soul"
2700,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,"Is there to guide its voyage through the dark,"
2701,THE MAIDEN'S CURSE.,Or spread the sails of that mysterious bark!

3544,INTRODUCTION.,"so far as relates to the grave of Harold, purely imaginary, as are"
3545,INTRODUCTION.,"all the characters, except those of the Conqueror, and of Edgar"
3546,INTRODUCTION.,"Atheling. History, I think, justifies me in representing William as"
3547,INTRODUCTION.,acting constantly under strong religious impressions. A few
3548,INTRODUCTION.,circumstances in his life will clearly show this. When Harold was
3549,INTRODUCTION.,"with him in Normandy, he took an oath of him on two altars, within"
3550,INTRODUCTION.,which were concealed miraculous relics.[88] His banner was sent
3551,INTRODUCTION.,"from Rome, consecrated by the Pope, for the especial purpose of the"
3552,INTRODUCTION.,invasion of England. Without adverting to the night spent in prayer
3553,INTRODUCTION.,"before the battle of Hastings, was not this impression more"
3554,INTRODUCTION.,decidedly shown when he pitched his tent among the dead on that
3555,INTRODUCTION.,"night, and vowed to build an abbey on the spot? The event of the"
3556,INTRODUCTION.,"battle was so much against all human probability, that his"
3557,INTRODUCTION.,"undertaking it, at the place and time, can only be reconciled by"
3558,INTRODUCTION.,supposing that he acted under some extraordinary impression.
3559,INTRODUCTION.,
3560,INTRODUCTION.,"When the battle was gained, he knew not on what course to"
3561,INTRODUCTION.,"determine: instead of marching to London, he retired towards Dover."
3562,INTRODUCTION.,"When he was met by the Kentish men, with green boughs, the quaint"
3563,INTRODUCTION.,"historian says, ""He was _daunted_."" These and many other incidental"
3564,INTRODUCTION.,circumstances may occur to the reader.

3566,INTRODUCTION.,"In representing him, therefore, as under the control of"
3567,INTRODUCTION.,"superstitious impressions, I trust I have not transgressed, at"

3824,CANTO FIRST.,When breathless expectation watches there.
3825,CANTO FIRST.,Upon the platform of the highest tower

3828,CANTO FIRST.,"The daughter of slain Harold, Adela,"

3830,CANTO FIRST.,Watched: for this night or death or victory
3831,CANTO FIRST.,The Saxon standard waits.
3832,CANTO FIRST.,"Hark! 'twas a shout,"
3833,CANTO FIRST.,And sounds at distance as of marching men!
3834,CANTO FIRST.,"No! all is silent, save the tide, that rakes,                      18"
3835,CANTO FIRST.,"At times, the beach, or breaks beneath the cliff."
3836,CANTO FIRST.,Listen! was it the fall of hastening oars?
3837,CANTO FIRST.,No! all is hushed! Oh! when will they return?
3838,CANTO FIRST.,"Adela sighed; for three long nights had passed,"
3839,CANTO FIRST.,"Since her brave brothers left these bastioned walls,"
3840,CANTO FIRST.,"And marched, with the confederate host, to York."
3841,CANTO FIRST.,They come not: Have they perished? So dark thoughts
3842,CANTO FIRST.,"Arose, and then she raised her look to heaven,"
3843,CANTO FIRST.,"And clasped the cross, and prayed more fervently."
3844,CANTO FIRST.,"Her lifted eye in the pale lamp-light shone,"
3845,CANTO FIRST.,Touched with a tear; soft airs of ocean blew
3846,CANTO FIRST.,"Her long light hair, whilst audibly she cried,                     30"
3847,CANTO FIRST.,"Preserve them, blessed Mary! oh! preserve"

3850,CANTO FIRST.,"Looked out, like hope! Instant, a trumpet rang,"
3851,CANTO FIRST.,"And voices rose, and hurrying lights appeared;"
3852,CANTO FIRST.,Now louder shouts along the platform peal--
3853,CANTO FIRST.,"Oh! they are Normans! she exclaimed, and grasped"
3854,CANTO FIRST.,"The old man's hand, and said, Yet we will die"
3855,CANTO FIRST.,"As Harold's daughter; and, with mien and voice,"
3856,CANTO FIRST.,"Firm and unfaltering, kissed the crucifix.                         40"
3857,CANTO FIRST.,"They knelt together, and the old man spoke:"

3862,CANTO FIRST.,"In arms, the beaver of his helmet raised,"
3863,CANTO FIRST.,"Some light hairs straying on his ruddy cheek,"
3864,CANTO FIRST.,"With breath hastily drawn, and cheering smile,"
3865,CANTO FIRST.,Young Atheling: The Saxon banner waves!
3866,CANTO FIRST.,"Oh! are my brothers safe? cried Adela,                             50"
3867,CANTO FIRST.,"Speak! speak! oh! tell me, do my brothers live?"
3868,CANTO FIRST.,Atheling answered: They will soon appear;                          52
3869,CANTO FIRST.,"My post was on the eastern hills, a scout"
3870,CANTO FIRST.,"Came breathless, sent from Edmund, and I hied,"

3873,CANTO FIRST.,"Even now, upon the citadel of York,"
3874,CANTO FIRST.,"Above the bursting fires, and rolling smoke,"
3875,CANTO FIRST.,The Saxon banner waves.
3876,CANTO FIRST.,"I thank thee, Lord!                      60"
3877,CANTO FIRST.,"My brothers live! cried Adela, and knelt"
3878,CANTO FIRST.,"Upon the platform, with uplifted hands,"
3879,CANTO FIRST.,"And look to heaven;--then rising, with a smile:"
3880,CANTO FIRST.,"We have watched, I and this old man here,"
3881,CANTO FIRST.,"Hour after hour, through the long lingering night,"
3882,CANTO FIRST.,And now 'tis almost morning: I will stay
3883,CANTO FIRST.,Till I have heard my brother's distant horn
3884,CANTO FIRST.,"From the west woods;--but you are weary, youth?"
3885,CANTO FIRST.,"Oh, no! I will keep watch with you till dawn;"
3886,CANTO FIRST.,To me most soothing is an hour like this!                          70
3887,CANTO FIRST.,"And who that saw, as now, the morning stars"
3888,CANTO FIRST.,"Begin to pale, and the gray twilight steal"
3889,CANTO FIRST.,"So calmly on the seas, and wide-hushed world,"
3890,CANTO FIRST.,Could deem there was a sound of misery
3891,CANTO FIRST.,"On earth; nay, who could hear thy gentle voice,"
3892,CANTO FIRST.,"Fair maid, and think there was a voice of hate"
3893,CANTO FIRST.,Or strife beneath the stillness of that cope
3894,CANTO FIRST.,Above us! Oh! I hate the noise of arms--
3895,CANTO FIRST.,"Here will I watch with you. Then, after pause,"
3896,CANTO FIRST.,Poor England is not what it once has been;                         80
3897,CANTO FIRST.,And strange are both our fortunes.
3898,CANTO FIRST.,"Atheling,"
3899,CANTO FIRST.,(Adela answered) early piety
3900,CANTO FIRST.,Hath disciplined my heart to every change.
3901,CANTO FIRST.,How didst thou pass in safety from this land                       85
3902,CANTO FIRST.,Of slavery and sorrow?
3903,CANTO FIRST.,He replied:
3904,CANTO FIRST.,When darker jealousy and lowering hate
3905,CANTO FIRST.,"Sat on the brow of William, England mourned,"
3906,CANTO FIRST.,And one dark spirit of conspiracy                                  90
3907,CANTO FIRST.,"Muttered its curses through the land. 'Twas then,"
3908,CANTO FIRST.,"With fiercer glare, the lion's eye was turned"
3909,CANTO FIRST.,On me:--My sisters and myself embarked--
3910,CANTO FIRST.,"The wide world was before us--we embarked,"
3911,CANTO FIRST.,"With some few faithful friends, and from the sea"
3912,CANTO FIRST.,"Gazed tearful, for a moment, on the shores"
3913,CANTO FIRST.,We left for ever (so it then appeared).
3914,CANTO FIRST.,Poor Margaret hid her face; but the fresh wind
3915,CANTO FIRST.,"Swelled the broad mainsail, and the lessening land,"
3916,CANTO FIRST.,"The towers, the spires, the villages, the smoke,                  100"
3917,CANTO FIRST.,Were seen no more.
3918,CANTO FIRST.,"When now at sea, the winds"
3919,CANTO FIRST.,"Blew adverse, for to Holland was our course:"
3920,CANTO FIRST.,More fearful rose the storm; the east wind sang
3921,CANTO FIRST.,"Louder, till wrecked upon the shores of Forth"
3922,CANTO FIRST.,"Our vessel lay. Here, friendless, we implored"
3923,CANTO FIRST.,A short sojourn and succour. Scotland's king
3924,CANTO FIRST.,Then sat in Dunfermline; he heard the tale
3925,CANTO FIRST.,"Of our distress, and flew himself to save;"
3926,CANTO FIRST.,"But when he saw my sister Margaret,                               110"
3927,CANTO FIRST.,"Young, innocent, and beautiful in tears,"
3928,CANTO FIRST.,His heart was moved.
3929,CANTO FIRST.,"Oh! welcome here, he cried:"
3930,CANTO FIRST.,"'Tis Heaven hath led you. Lady, look on me--"
3931,CANTO FIRST.,"If such a flower be cast to the bleak winds,"
3932,CANTO FIRST.,'Twere meet I took and wore it next my heart.
3933,CANTO FIRST.,"Judged he not well, fair maid?"
3934,CANTO FIRST.,Thou know'st the rest;                   118
3935,CANTO FIRST.,"Compassion nurtured love, and Margaret"
3936,CANTO FIRST.,(Such are the events of ruling Providence)
3937,CANTO FIRST.,Is now all Scotland's queen!
3938,CANTO FIRST.,To join the bands
3939,CANTO FIRST.,"Of warriors in one cause assembled here,"
3940,CANTO FIRST.,King Malcolm left his land of hills; his arm
3941,CANTO FIRST.,Might make the Conqueror tremble on his throne!
3942,CANTO FIRST.,"Even should we fail, my sister Margaret"
3943,CANTO FIRST.,"Would love and honour you; and I might hope,"
3944,CANTO FIRST.,(Oh! might I?) on the banks of Tay or Tweed
3945,CANTO FIRST.,"With thee to wander, where no curfew sounds,"
3946,CANTO FIRST.,"And mark the summer sun, beyond the hills,                        130"
3947,CANTO FIRST.,"Sink in its glory, and then, hand in hand,"
3948,CANTO FIRST.,"Wind through the woods, and--"
3949,CANTO FIRST.,"Adela replied,"
3950,CANTO FIRST.,"With smile complacent, Listen; I will be"
3951,CANTO FIRST.,(So to beguile the creeping hours of time)
3952,CANTO FIRST.,A tale-teller. Two years we held sojourn
3953,CANTO FIRST.,"In Denmark; two long weary years, and sighed"
3954,CANTO FIRST.,"When, looking on the southern deep, we thought"
3955,CANTO FIRST.,Of our poor country. Give me men and ships!
3956,CANTO FIRST.,Godwin still cried; oh! give me men and ships!                    140
3957,CANTO FIRST.,"The king commanded, and his armament--"
3958,CANTO FIRST.,"A mightier never stemmed the Baltic deep,"
3959,CANTO FIRST.,"Sent forth by sea-kings of the north, or bent"
3960,CANTO FIRST.,On hardier enterprise; for not some isle
3961,CANTO FIRST.,"Of the lone Orcades was now the prize,"
3962,CANTO FIRST.,But England's throne.
3963,CANTO FIRST.,His mighty armament
3964,CANTO FIRST.,Now left the shores of Denmark. Our brave ships
3965,CANTO FIRST.,"Burst through the Baltic straits, how gloriously!"
3966,CANTO FIRST.,I heard the trumpets ring; I saw the sails                        150
3967,CANTO FIRST.,"Of nigh three hundred war-ships, the dim verge"
3968,CANTO FIRST.,Of the remote horizon's skiey track                               152
3969,CANTO FIRST.,"Bestudding, here and there, like gems of light"
3970,CANTO FIRST.,Dropped from the radiance of the morning sun
3971,CANTO FIRST.,On the gray waste of waters. So our ships
3972,CANTO FIRST.,"Swept o'er the billows of the north, and steered"
3973,CANTO FIRST.,Right on to England.
3974,CANTO FIRST.,Foremost of the fleet
3975,CANTO FIRST.,Our gallant vessel rode; around the mast
3976,CANTO FIRST.,"Emblazoned shields were ranged, and plumed crests                 160"
3977,CANTO FIRST.,"Shook as the north-east rose. Upon the prow,"
3978,CANTO FIRST.,"More ardent, Godwin, my brave brother, stood,"
3979,CANTO FIRST.,"And milder Edmund, on whose mailed arm"
3980,CANTO FIRST.,"I hung, when the white waves before us swelled,"
3981,CANTO FIRST.,"And parted. The broad banner, in full length,"
3982,CANTO FIRST.,"Streamed out its folds, on which the Saxon horse"
3983,CANTO FIRST.,"Ramped, as impatient on the land to leap,"
3984,CANTO FIRST.,To which the winds still bore it bravely on;
3985,CANTO FIRST.,"Whilst the red cross on the front banner shone,"
3986,CANTO FIRST.,The hoar deep crimsoning.                                         170
3987,CANTO FIRST.,"Winds, bear us on;"
3988,CANTO FIRST.,"Bear us as cheerily, till white Albion's cliffs"
3989,CANTO FIRST.,"Resound to our triumphant shouts; till there,"
3990,CANTO FIRST.,"On his own Tower, that frowns above the Thames,"
3991,CANTO FIRST.,"Even there we plant these banners and this cross,"
3992,CANTO FIRST.,And stamp the Conqueror and his crown to dust!
3993,CANTO FIRST.,They would have kept me on a foreign shore;
3994,CANTO FIRST.,But could I leave my brothers! I with them
3995,CANTO FIRST.,"Grew up, with them I left my native land,"
3996,CANTO FIRST.,"With them all perils have I braved, of sea                        180"
3997,CANTO FIRST.,"Or war, all storms of hard adversity;"
3998,CANTO FIRST.,"Let death betide, I reck not; all I ask"
3999,CANTO FIRST.,"Is yet once more, in this sad world, to kneel"
4000,CANTO FIRST.,"Upon my father's grave, and kiss the earth."
4001,CANTO FIRST.,"When the fourth morning gleamed along the deep,"
4002,CANTO FIRST.,"England, Old England! burst the general cry:                      186"
4003,CANTO FIRST.,"England, Old England! Every eye, intent,"
4004,CANTO FIRST.,Was turned; and Godwin pointed with his sword
4005,CANTO FIRST.,"To Flamborough, pale rising o'er the surge."
4006,CANTO FIRST.,Nearer into the kingdom's heart bear on
4007,CANTO FIRST.,The death-storm of our vengeance! Godwin cried.
4008,CANTO FIRST.,"Soon, like a cloud, the northern Foreland rose--"
4009,CANTO FIRST.,"Know ye those cliffs, towering in giant state!"
4010,CANTO FIRST.,"But, hark! along the shores alarum-bells"
4011,CANTO FIRST.,"Ring out more loud, blast answers blast, the swords"
4012,CANTO FIRST.,"Of hurrying horsemen, and projected spears,"
4013,CANTO FIRST.,Flash to the sun. On yonder castle walls
4014,CANTO FIRST.,A thousand bows are bent; again our course
4015,CANTO FIRST.,Back to the north is turned. Now twilight veiled
4016,CANTO FIRST.,"The sinking sands of Yarmouth, and we heard                       200"
4017,CANTO FIRST.,A long deep toll from many a village tower
4018,CANTO FIRST.,"On shore--and, lo! the scattered inland lights,"
4019,CANTO FIRST.,"That sprinkled winding ocean's lowly verge,"
4020,CANTO FIRST.,"At once are lost in darkness. God in heaven,"
4021,CANTO FIRST.,"It is the curfew! Godwin cried, and smote"
4022,CANTO FIRST.,His forehead. We all heard that sullen sound
4023,CANTO FIRST.,"For the first time, that night; but the winds blew,"
4024,CANTO FIRST.,Our ship sailed out of hearing; yet we thought
4025,CANTO FIRST.,"Of the poor mother, who, on winter nights,"
4026,CANTO FIRST.,When her belated husband from the wood                            210
4027,CANTO FIRST.,"Was not come back, her lonely taper lit,"
4028,CANTO FIRST.,"And turned the glass, and saw the faggot-flame"
4029,CANTO FIRST.,Shine on the faces of her little ones:
4030,CANTO FIRST.,Those times will ne'er return.
4031,CANTO FIRST.,Darkness descends;
4032,CANTO FIRST.,Again the sun is rising o'er the waves;
4033,CANTO FIRST.,"And now hoarse Humber roars beneath our keels,"
4034,CANTO FIRST.,And we have landed
4035,CANTO FIRST.,"Yea, and struck a blow,                       219"
4036,CANTO FIRST.,"Such as may make the crowned Conqueror quail,"
4037,CANTO FIRST.,Edgar replied.
4038,CANTO FIRST.,"Grant Heaven that we may live,"
4039,CANTO FIRST.,"Adela cried, in love and peace again,"
4040,CANTO FIRST.,When every storm is past. But this good man
4041,CANTO FIRST.,"Is silent. Ailric, does no hope, even now,"
4042,CANTO FIRST.,"Arise on thy dark heart? Good father, speak!"
4043,CANTO FIRST.,"With aspect mild, on which its fitful light"
4044,CANTO FIRST.,"The watch-tower lamp threw pale, the monk replied:"
4045,CANTO FIRST.,"Youth, on thy light hair and ingenuous brow"
4046,CANTO FIRST.,"Most comely sits the morn of life; on me,                         230"
4047,CANTO FIRST.,"And this bare head, the night of time descends"
4048,CANTO FIRST.,"In sorrow. I look back upon the past,"
4049,CANTO FIRST.,"And think of joy and sadness upon earth,"
4050,CANTO FIRST.,Like the vast ocean's fluctuating toil
4051,CANTO FIRST.,From everlasting! I have seen its waste
4052,CANTO FIRST.,Now in the sunshine sleeping; now high-ridged
4053,CANTO FIRST.,With storms; and such the kingdoms of the earth.
4054,CANTO FIRST.,"Yes, youth, and flattering fortune, and the light"
4055,CANTO FIRST.,"Of summer days, are as the radiance"
4056,CANTO FIRST.,"That flits along the solitary waves,                              240"
4057,CANTO FIRST.,"Even whilst we gaze, and say, How beautiful!"
4058,CANTO FIRST.,So fitful and so perishing the dream
4059,CANTO FIRST.,"Of human things! But there is light above,"
4060,CANTO FIRST.,"Undying; and, at times, faint harmonies"
4061,CANTO FIRST.,"Heard, by the weary pilgrim, in his way"
4062,CANTO FIRST.,"O'er perilous rocks, and through unwatered wastes,"
4063,CANTO FIRST.,"Who looks up, fainting, and prays earnestly"
4064,CANTO FIRST.,"To pass into that rest, whence sounds so sweet"
4065,CANTO FIRST.,"Come, whispering of hope; else it were best"
4066,CANTO FIRST.,Beneath the load the forlorn heart endures                        250
4067,CANTO FIRST.,To sink at once; to shut the eyes on things
4068,CANTO FIRST.,That sear the sight; and so to wrap the soul
4069,CANTO FIRST.,"In sullen, tearless, ruthless apathy!                             253"
4070,CANTO FIRST.,"Therefore, 'midst every human change, I drop"
4071,CANTO FIRST.,"A tear upon the cross, and all is calm;"
4072,CANTO FIRST.,"Yea, full of blissful and of brightest views,"
4073,CANTO FIRST.,On this dark tide of time.
4074,CANTO FIRST.,"Youth, thou hast known"
4075,CANTO FIRST.,"Adversity; even in thy morn of life,"
4076,CANTO FIRST.,"The springtide rainbow fades, and many days,                      260"
4077,CANTO FIRST.,"And many years, perchance, of weal or woe"
4078,CANTO FIRST.,"Hang o'er thee! happy, if through every change"
4079,CANTO FIRST.,"Thy constant heart, thy steadfast view, be fixed"
4080,CANTO FIRST.,"Upon that better kingdom, where the crown"
4081,CANTO FIRST.,"Immortal is held out to holy hope,"
4082,CANTO FIRST.,Beyond the clouds that rest upon the grave.
4083,CANTO FIRST.,Oh! I remember when King Harold stood
4084,CANTO FIRST.,Blooming in youth like thee; I saw him crowned--
4085,CANTO FIRST.,I heard the loud voice of a nation hail
4086,CANTO FIRST.,"His rising star; then, flaming in mid-heaven                      270"
4087,CANTO FIRST.,"The red portentous comet,[97] like the hand"
4088,CANTO FIRST.,"Upon the wall, came forth: its fatal course"
4089,CANTO FIRST.,"All marked, and gazed in terror, as it looked"
4090,CANTO FIRST.,With lurid light upon this land. It passed;
4091,CANTO FIRST.,"Old men had many bodings; but I saw,"
4092,CANTO FIRST.,"Reckless, King Harold, in his plumed helm,"
4093,CANTO FIRST.,"Ride foremost of the mailed chivalry,"
4094,CANTO FIRST.,"That, when the fierce Norwegian passed the seas,"
4095,CANTO FIRST.,"Met his host man to man; I saw the sword,"
4096,CANTO FIRST.,"Advanced and glittering, in the victor's hand,                    280"
4097,CANTO FIRST.,That smote the Hardrada[98] to the earth! To-day
4098,CANTO FIRST.,"King Harold rose, like an avenging God;"
4099,CANTO FIRST.,"To-morrow (so it seemed, so short the space),                     283"
4100,CANTO FIRST.,"To-morrow, through the field of blood, we sought"
4101,CANTO FIRST.,His mangled corse amid the heaps of slain:
4102,CANTO FIRST.,Shall I recount the event more faithfully?
4103,CANTO FIRST.,Its spectred memory never since that hour
4104,CANTO FIRST.,Has left my heart.
4105,CANTO FIRST.,"William was in his tent,"
4106,CANTO FIRST.,"Spread on the battle-plain, on that same night                    290"
4107,CANTO FIRST.,When seventy thousand dead lay at his feet;
4108,CANTO FIRST.,"They who, at sunrise, with bent bows and spears,"
4109,CANTO FIRST.,"Confronted and defied him, at his feet"
4110,CANTO FIRST.,"Lay dead! Alone he watches in his tent,"
4111,CANTO FIRST.,At midnight; 'midst a sight so terrible
4112,CANTO FIRST.,"We came; we stood before him, where he sat,"
4113,CANTO FIRST.,I and my brother Osgood. Who are ye?
4114,CANTO FIRST.,Sternly he asked; and Osgood thus replied:
4115,CANTO FIRST.,"Conqueror, and lord, and soon to be a king,"
4116,CANTO FIRST.,"We, two poor monks of Waltham Abbey, kneel                        300"
4117,CANTO FIRST.,"Before thee, sorrowing! He who is slain"
4118,CANTO FIRST.,To us was bountiful. He raised those walls
4119,CANTO FIRST.,Where we devote our life to prayer and praise.
4120,CANTO FIRST.,Oh! by the mercies which the God of all
4121,CANTO FIRST.,"Hath shewn to thee this day, grant our request;"
4122,CANTO FIRST.,"To search for his dead body, through this field"
4123,CANTO FIRST.,"Of terror, that his bones may rest with us."
4124,CANTO FIRST.,"Your king hath met the meed of broken faith,"
4125,CANTO FIRST.,William replied. But yet he shall not want
4126,CANTO FIRST.,A sepulchre; and on this very spot                                310
4127,CANTO FIRST.,"My purpose stands, as I have vowed to God,"
4128,CANTO FIRST.,"To build a holy monastery: here,"
4129,CANTO FIRST.,A hundred monks shall pray for all who fell
4130,CANTO FIRST.,In this dread strife; and your King Harold here
4131,CANTO FIRST.,Shall have due honours and a stately tomb.
4132,CANTO FIRST.,"Still on our knees, we answered, Oh! not so,"
4133,CANTO FIRST.,"Dread sovereign;--hear us, of your clemency.                      317"
4134,CANTO FIRST.,We beg his body; beg it for the sake
4135,CANTO FIRST.,"Of our successors; beg it for ourselves,"
4136,CANTO FIRST.,That we may bury it in the same spot
4137,CANTO FIRST.,Himself ordained when living; where the choirs
4138,CANTO FIRST.,"May sing for his repose, in distant years,"
4139,CANTO FIRST.,When we are dust and ashes.
4140,CANTO FIRST.,"Then go forth,"
4141,CANTO FIRST.,"And search for him, at the first dawn of day,"
4142,CANTO FIRST.,"King William said. We crossed our breasts, and passed,"
4143,CANTO FIRST.,"Slow rising, from his presence. So we went,"
4144,CANTO FIRST.,"In silence, to the quarry of the dead."
4145,CANTO FIRST.,The sun rose on that still and dismal host;
4146,CANTO FIRST.,"Toiling from corse to corse, we trod in blood,                    330"
4147,CANTO FIRST.,"From morn till noon toiling, and then I said,"
4148,CANTO FIRST.,"Seek Editha, her whom he loved. She came;"
4149,CANTO FIRST.,And through the field of death she passed: she looked
4150,CANTO FIRST.,"On many a face, ghastly upturned; her hand"
4151,CANTO FIRST.,"Unloosed the helmet, smoothed the clotted hair,"
4152,CANTO FIRST.,And many livid hands she took in hers;
4153,CANTO FIRST.,"Till, stooping o'er a mangled corse, she shrieked,"
4154,CANTO FIRST.,"Then into tears burst audibly, and turned"
4155,CANTO FIRST.,"Her face, and with a faltering voice pronounced,"
4156,CANTO FIRST.,"Oh, Harold! We took up, and bore the corse                        340"
4157,CANTO FIRST.,"From that sad spot, and washed the ghastly wound"
4158,CANTO FIRST.,"Deep in the forehead, where the broken barb"
4159,CANTO FIRST.,Was fixed.
4160,CANTO FIRST.,"So weltering from the field, we bore"
4161,CANTO FIRST.,King Harold's corse. A hundred Norman knights
4162,CANTO FIRST.,"Met the sad train, with pikes that trailed the ground."
4163,CANTO FIRST.,"Our old men prayed, and spoke of evil days"
4164,CANTO FIRST.,To come; the women smote their breasts and wept;
4165,CANTO FIRST.,"The little children knelt beside the way,"
4166,CANTO FIRST.,As on to Waltham the funereal car                                 350
4167,CANTO FIRST.,Moved slow. Few and disconsolate the train                        351
4168,CANTO FIRST.,"Of English earls, for few, alas! remained;"
4169,CANTO FIRST.,So many in the field of death lay cold.
4170,CANTO FIRST.,"The horses slowly paced, till Waltham towers"
4171,CANTO FIRST.,"Before us rose. There, with long tapered blaze,"
4172,CANTO FIRST.,"Our brethren met us, chanting, two and two,"
4173,CANTO FIRST.,"The ""Miserere"" of the dead. And there--"
4174,CANTO FIRST.,"But, my child Adela, you are in tears--"
4175,CANTO FIRST.,There at the foot of the high altar lies
4176,CANTO FIRST.,"The last of Saxon kings. Sad Editha,                              360"
4177,CANTO FIRST.,"At distance, watched the rites, and from that hour"
4178,CANTO FIRST.,We never saw her more.
4179,CANTO FIRST.,A distant trump
4180,CANTO FIRST.,Now rung--again!--again!--and thrice a trump
4181,CANTO FIRST.,Has answered from the walls of Ravenspur.
4182,CANTO FIRST.,"My brothers! they are here! Adela cried,"
4183,CANTO FIRST.,And left the tower in breathless ardour. York
4184,CANTO FIRST.,Flames to the sky! a general voice was heard--
4185,CANTO FIRST.,The drawbridge clanks; into the inner court
4186,CANTO FIRST.,A mailed man rides on--York is no more!                           370
4187,CANTO FIRST.,The cry without redoubles. On the ground
4188,CANTO FIRST.,"The rider flung his bloody sword, and raised"
4189,CANTO FIRST.,"His helm, dismounting: the first dawn of day"
4190,CANTO FIRST.,"Gleamed on the shattered plume. Oh! Adela,"
4191,CANTO FIRST.,"He cried, your brother Godwin! and she flew,"
4192,CANTO FIRST.,"And murmuring, My brave brother! hid her face,"
4193,CANTO FIRST.,"Clasping his mailed breast. Soon gazing round,"
4194,CANTO FIRST.,"She cried, But where is Edmund? Was he wont"
4195,CANTO FIRST.,To linger?
4196,CANTO FIRST.,"Edmund has a sacred charge,                            380"
4197,CANTO FIRST.,"Godwin replied. But trust his anxious love,"
4198,CANTO FIRST.,We soon shall hear his voice. I need some rest--
4199,CANTO FIRST.,'Tis now broad day; but we have watched and fought:
4200,CANTO FIRST.,"I can sleep sound, though the shrill bird of morn                 384"
4201,CANTO FIRST.,Mount and upbraid my slumbers with her song.
4202,CANTO FIRST.,Tranquil and clear the autumnal day declined:
4203,CANTO FIRST.,The barks at anchor cast their lengthened shades
4204,CANTO FIRST.,On the gray bastioned walls; airs from the deep
4205,CANTO FIRST.,"Wandered, and touched the cordage as they passed,"
4206,CANTO FIRST.,"Then hovered with expiring breath, and stirred                    390"
4207,CANTO FIRST.,Scarce the quiescent pennant; the bright sea
4208,CANTO FIRST.,"Lay silent in its glorious amplitude,"
4209,CANTO FIRST.,"Without; far up, in the pale atmosphere,"
4210,CANTO FIRST.,"A white cloud, here and there, hung overhead,"
4211,CANTO FIRST.,"And some red freckles streaked the horizon's edge,"
4212,CANTO FIRST.,"Far as the sight could reach; beneath the rocks,"
4213,CANTO FIRST.,"That reared their dark brows beetling o'er the bay,"
4214,CANTO FIRST.,"The gulls and guillemots, with short quaint cry,"
4215,CANTO FIRST.,"Just broke the sleeping stillness of the air,"
4216,CANTO FIRST.,"Or, skimming, almost touched the level main,                      400"
4217,CANTO FIRST.,"With wings far seen, and more intensely white,"
4218,CANTO FIRST.,Opposed to the blue space; whilst Panope
4219,CANTO FIRST.,"Played in the offing. Humber's ocean-stream,"
4220,CANTO FIRST.,"Inland, went sounding on, by rocks and sands"
4221,CANTO FIRST.,"And castle, yet so sounding as it seemed"
4222,CANTO FIRST.,A voice amidst the hushed and listening world
4223,CANTO FIRST.,That spoke of peace; whilst from the bastion's point
4224,CANTO FIRST.,One piping red-breast might almost be heard.
4225,CANTO FIRST.,"Such quiet all things hushed, so peaceable"
4226,CANTO FIRST.,"The hour: the very swallows, ere they leave                       410"
4227,CANTO FIRST.,The coast to pass a long and weary way
4228,CANTO FIRST.,"O'er ocean's solitude, seem to renew"
4229,CANTO FIRST.,"Once more their summer feelings, as a light"
4230,CANTO FIRST.,"So sweet would last for ever, whilst they flock"
4231,CANTO FIRST.,In the brief sunshine of the turret-top.
4232,CANTO FIRST.,"'Twas at this hour of evening, Adela"
4233,CANTO FIRST.,"And Godwin, now restored by rest, went forth,"
4234,CANTO FIRST.,"Linked arm in arm, upon the eastern beach,                        418"
4235,CANTO FIRST.,Beyond the headland's shade. If such an hour
4236,CANTO FIRST.,"Seemed smiling on the heart, how smiled it now"
4237,CANTO FIRST.,"To him who yesternight, a soldier, stood"
4238,CANTO FIRST.,Amid the direst sight of human strife
4239,CANTO FIRST.,"And bloodshed; heard the cries, the trumpet's blast,"
4240,CANTO FIRST.,"Ring o'er the dying; saw, with all its towers,"
4241,CANTO FIRST.,"A city blazing to the midnight sky,"
4242,CANTO FIRST.,"And mangled groups of miserable men,"
4243,CANTO FIRST.,"Gasping or dead, whilst with his iron heel"
4244,CANTO FIRST.,He splashed the blood beneath! How changed the scene!
4245,CANTO FIRST.,"The sun's last light upon the battlements,"
4246,CANTO FIRST.,"The sea, the landscape, the peace-breathing air,                  430"
4247,CANTO FIRST.,Remembered both of the departed hours
4248,CANTO FIRST.,"Of early life, when once they had a home,"
4249,CANTO FIRST.,"A country, where their father wore a crown."
4250,CANTO FIRST.,"What changes since that time, for them and all"
4251,CANTO FIRST.,"They loved! how many found an early grave,"
4252,CANTO FIRST.,"Cut off by the red sword! how many mourned,"
4253,CANTO FIRST.,"Scattered by various fates, through distant lands!"
4254,CANTO FIRST.,"How desolate their own poor country, bound"
4255,CANTO FIRST.,By the oppressor's chain! As thoughts like these
4256,CANTO FIRST.,"Arose, the bells of rural Nevilthorpe                             440"
4257,CANTO FIRST.,"Rang out a joyous peal, rang merrily,"
4258,CANTO FIRST.,For tidings heard from York: their melody
4259,CANTO FIRST.,"Mingled with things forgotten. Until then,"
4260,CANTO FIRST.,"And then remembered freshly, Adela"
4261,CANTO FIRST.,"That instant turned to hide her tears, and saw"
4262,CANTO FIRST.,Her brother Edmund leading by the hand
4263,CANTO FIRST.,A boy of lovely mien and footstep light
4264,CANTO FIRST.,"Along the sands. My sister, Edmund cried,"
4265,CANTO FIRST.,See here a footpage I have brought from York
4266,CANTO FIRST.,To serve a lady fair! The boy held out                            450
4267,CANTO FIRST.,"His hand to Adela, as he would say,"
4268,CANTO FIRST.,"Look, and protect me, lady. Adela,                                452"
4269,CANTO FIRST.,"Advancing with a smile and glowing cheek,"
4270,CANTO FIRST.,"Cried, Welcome, truant brother; and then took"
4271,CANTO FIRST.,"The child's right hand, and said, My pretty page,"
4272,CANTO FIRST.,And have you not a tale to tell to me?
4273,CANTO FIRST.,"The boy spake nothing, but looked earnestly"
4274,CANTO FIRST.,"And anxiously at Edmund. Edmund said,"
4275,CANTO FIRST.,"If he is silent, I must speak for him."
4276,CANTO FIRST.,"'Twas when the minster flamed, and, sword in hand,                460"
4277,CANTO FIRST.,"Godwin, and Waltheof, and stern Hereward,"
4278,CANTO FIRST.,Directed the red slaughter; black with smoke
4279,CANTO FIRST.,"I burst into the citadel, and saw,"
4280,CANTO FIRST.,"Not the grim warder, with his huge axe up,"

4594,CANTO THIRD.,A requiem was chanted; for last night
4595,CANTO THIRD.,"A passing spirit shook the battlements,"
4596,CANTO THIRD.,"And the pale monk, at midnight, as he watched"
4597,CANTO THIRD.,"The lamp, beheld it tremble; whilst the shrines"
4598,CANTO THIRD.,"Shook, as the deep foundations of the fane"
4599,CANTO THIRD.,Were moved. Oh! pray for Harold's soul! he cried.
4600,CANTO THIRD.,"And now, at matin bell, the monks were met,"
4601,CANTO THIRD.,"And slowly pacing round the grave, they sang:"
4602,CANTO THIRD.,
4603,DIRGE.,DIRGE.
4604,DIRGE.,
4605,DIRGE.,"Peace, oh! peace, be to the shade                              10"
4606,DIRGE.,Of him who here in earth is laid:
4607,DIRGE.,"Saints and spirits of the blessed,"
4608,DIRGE.,Look upon his bed of rest;
4609,DIRGE.,"Forgive his sins, propitious be;"
4610,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine,"
4611,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine!"
4612,DIRGE.,
4613,DIRGE.,"When, from yonder window's height,"
4614,DIRGE.,"The moonbeams on the floor are bright,"
4615,DIRGE.,"Sounds of viewless harps shall die,"
4616,DIRGE.,Sounds of heaven's own harmony!                                20
4617,DIRGE.,"Forgive his sins, propitious be;                               21"
4618,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine,"
4619,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine!"
4620,DIRGE.,
4621,DIRGE.,"By the spirits of the brave,"
4622,DIRGE.,Who died the land they loved to save;
4623,DIRGE.,"By the soldier's faint farewell,"
4624,DIRGE.,"By freedom's blessing, where he fell;"
4625,DIRGE.,"Forgive his sins, propitious be;"
4626,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine,"
4627,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine!                                            30"
4628,DIRGE.,
4629,DIRGE.,"By a nation's mingled moan,"
4630,DIRGE.,"By liberty's expiring groan,"
4631,DIRGE.,"By the saints, to whom 'tis given"
4632,DIRGE.,To bear that parting groan to heaven;
4633,DIRGE.,To his shade propitious be;
4634,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine,"
4635,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine!"
4636,DIRGE.,
4637,DIRGE.,The proud and mighty--
4638,DIRGE.,
4639,DIRGE.,"As they sung, the doors"
4640,DIRGE.,"Of the west portal, with a sound that shook                        40"
4641,DIRGE.,"The vaulted roofs, burst open; and, behold!"
4642,DIRGE.,"An armed Norman knight, the helmet closed"
4643,DIRGE.,"Upon his visage, but of stature tall,"
4644,DIRGE.,"His coal-black armour clanking as he trod,"
4645,DIRGE.,"Advancing up the middle aisle alone,"
4646,DIRGE.,Approached: he gazed in silence on the grave
4647,DIRGE.,"Of the last Saxon; there a while he stood,"
4648,DIRGE.,"Then knelt a moment, muttering a brief prayer:"
4649,DIRGE.,The fathers crossed their breasts--the mass-song ceased;
4650,DIRGE.,"Heedless of all around, the mailed man                             50"
4651,DIRGE.,"Rose up, nor speaking, nor inclining, paced                        51"
4652,DIRGE.,"Back through the sounding aisle, and left the fane."
4653,DIRGE.,The monks their interrupted song renewed:
4654,DIRGE.,
4655,DIRGE.,"The proud and mighty, when they die,"
4656,DIRGE.,With the crawling worm shall lie;
4657,DIRGE.,"But who would not a crown resign,"
4658,DIRGE.,"Harold, for a rest like thine!"
4659,DIRGE.,"Saviour Lord, propitious be;"
4660,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine,"
4661,DIRGE.,"Dona pacem, Domine!                                            60"
4662,DIRGE.,
4663,DIRGE.,"""Pacem"" (as slow the stoled train retire),"
4664,DIRGE.,"""Pacem,"" the shrines and fretted roofs returned."
4665,DIRGE.,"'Twas told, three Norman knights, in armour, spurred"
4666,DIRGE.,Their foaming steeds to the West Abbey door;
4667,DIRGE.,"But who it was, that with his visor closed"
4668,DIRGE.,"Passed up the long and echoing fane alone,"
4669,DIRGE.,"And knelt on Harold's gravestone, none could tell."
4670,DIRGE.,"The stranger knights in silence left the fane,"
4671,DIRGE.,And soon were lost in the surrounding shades
4672,DIRGE.,Of Waltham forest.                                                 70
4673,DIRGE.,He who foremost rode
4674,DIRGE.,"Passed his companions, on his fleeter steed,"
4675,DIRGE.,"And, muttering in a dark and dreamy mood,"
4676,DIRGE.,"Spurred on alone, till, looking round, he heard"
4677,DIRGE.,"Only the murmur of the woods above,"
4678,DIRGE.,Whilst soon all traces of a road were lost
4679,DIRGE.,In the inextricable maze. From morn
4680,DIRGE.,"Till eve, in the wild woods he wandered lost."
4681,DIRGE.,"Night followed, and the gathering storm was heard"
4682,DIRGE.,Among the branches. List! there is no sound                        80
4683,DIRGE.,"Of horn far off, or tramp of toiling steed,"
4684,DIRGE.,Or call of some belated forester;
4685,DIRGE.,No lonely taper lights the waste; the woods                        83
4686,DIRGE.,"Wave high their melancholy boughs, and bend"
4687,DIRGE.,Beneath the rising tempest. Heard ye not
4688,DIRGE.,Low thunder to the north! The solemn roll
4689,DIRGE.,"Redoubles through the darkening forest deep,"
4690,DIRGE.,"That sounds through all its solitude, and rocks,"
4691,DIRGE.,As the long peal at distance rolls away.
4692,DIRGE.,Hark! the loud thunder crashes overhead;                           90
4693,DIRGE.,"And, as the red fire flings a fitful glare,"
4694,DIRGE.,"The branches of old oaks, and mossy trunks,"
4695,DIRGE.,"Distinct and visible shine out; and, lo!"
4696,DIRGE.,"Interminable woods, a moment seen,"
4697,DIRGE.,"Then lost again in deeper, lonelier night."
4698,DIRGE.,The torrent rain o'er the vast leafy cope
4699,DIRGE.,"Comes sounding, and the drops fall heavily"
4700,DIRGE.,Where the strange knight is sheltered by the trunk
4701,DIRGE.,"Of a huge oak, whose dripping branches sweep"
4702,DIRGE.,"Far round. Oh! happy, if beneath the flash                        100"
4703,DIRGE.,"Some castle's bannered battlements were seen,"
4704,DIRGE.,"Where the lone minstrel, as the storm of night"
4705,DIRGE.,"Blew loud without, beside the blazing hearth"
4706,DIRGE.,"Might dry his hoary locks, and strike his harp"
4707,DIRGE.,(The fire relumined in his aged eyes)
4708,DIRGE.,To songs of Charlemagne!
4709,DIRGE.,"Or, happier yet"
4710,DIRGE.,If some gray convent's bell remote proclaimed
4711,DIRGE.,"The hour of midnight service, when the chant"
4712,DIRGE.,"Was up, and the long range of windows shone                       110"
4713,DIRGE.,Far off on the lone woods; whilst Charity
4714,DIRGE.,"Might bless and welcome, in a night like this,"
4715,DIRGE.,"The veriest outcast! Angel of the storm,"
4716,DIRGE.,Ha! thy red bolt this instant shivering rives
4717,DIRGE.,That blasted oak!
4718,DIRGE.,"The horse starts back, and bounds                   116"
4719,DIRGE.,From the knight's grasp. The way is dark and wild;
4720,DIRGE.,As dark and wild as if the solitude
4721,DIRGE.,Had never heard the sound of human steps.
4722,DIRGE.,"Pondering he stood, when, by the lightning's glance,              120"
4723,DIRGE.,The knight now marked a small and craggy path
4724,DIRGE.,Descending through the woody labyrinth.
4725,DIRGE.,"He tracked his way slowly from brake to brake,"
4726,DIRGE.,Till now he gained a deep sequestered glen.
4727,DIRGE.,"I fear not storms, nor thunders, nor the sword,"
4728,DIRGE.,"The knight exclaimed: that eye alone I fear,"
4729,DIRGE.,God's stern and steadfast eye upon the heart!
4730,DIRGE.,Yet peace is in the grave where Harold sleeps.
4731,DIRGE.,"Who speaks of Harold? cried a woman's voice,"
4732,DIRGE.,"Heard through the deep night of the woods. He spoke,              130"
4733,DIRGE.,"A stern voice answered, _he_ of Harold spoke,"
4734,DIRGE.,"Who feared his sword in the red front of war,"
4735,DIRGE.,Less than the powers of darkness: and he crossed
4736,DIRGE.,"His breast, for at that instant rose the thought"
4737,DIRGE.,"Of the weird sisters of the wold, that mock"
4738,DIRGE.,"Night wanderers, and ""syllable men's names"""
4739,DIRGE.,"In savage solitude. If now, he cried,"
4740,DIRGE.,"Dark minister, thy spells of wizard power"
4741,DIRGE.,"Have raised the storm and wild winds up, appear!"
4742,DIRGE.,"He scarce had spoken, when, by the red flash                      140"
4743,DIRGE.,"That glanced along the glen, half visible,"
4744,DIRGE.,"Uprose a tall, majestic female form:"
4745,DIRGE.,"So visible, her eyes' intenser light"
4746,DIRGE.,"Shone wildly through the darkness; and her face,"
4747,DIRGE.,"On which one pale flash more intently shone,"
4748,DIRGE.,"Was like a ghost's by moonlight, as she stood"
4749,DIRGE.,"A moment seen: her lips appeared to move,"
4750,DIRGE.,"Muttering, whilst her long locks of ebon hair"
4751,DIRGE.,"Streamed o'er her forehead, by the bleak winds blown              149"
4752,DIRGE.,Upon her heaving breast.
4753,DIRGE.,The knight advanced;
4754,DIRGE.,"The expiring embers from a cave within,"
4755,DIRGE.,"Now wakened by the night-air, shot a light,"
4756,DIRGE.,"Fitful and trembling, and this human form,"
4757,DIRGE.,"If it were human, at the entrance stood,"
4758,DIRGE.,"As seemed, of a rude cave. You might have thought"
4759,DIRGE.,"She had strange spells, such a mysterious power"
4760,DIRGE.,"Was round her; such terrific solitude,"
4761,DIRGE.,"Such night, as of the kingdom of the grave;"
4762,DIRGE.,Whilst hurricanes seemed to obey her 'hest.                       160
4763,DIRGE.,"And she no less admired, when, front to front,"
4764,DIRGE.,"By the rekindling ember's darted gleam,"
4765,DIRGE.,"A mailed man, of proud illustrious port,"
4766,DIRGE.,"She marked; and thus, but with unfaltering voice,"
4767,DIRGE.,She spake:
4768,DIRGE.,Yes! it was Harold's name I heard!
4769,DIRGE.,"Whence, and what art thou? I have watched the night,"
4770,DIRGE.,And listened to the tempest as it howled;
4771,DIRGE.,"And whilst I listening lay, methought I heard,"
4772,DIRGE.,"Even now, the tramp as of a rushing steed;                        170"
4773,DIRGE.,"Therefore I rose, and looked into the dark,"
4774,DIRGE.,"And now I hear one speak of Harold: say,"
4775,DIRGE.,"Whence, and what art thou, solitary man?"
4776,DIRGE.,"If lost and weary, enter this poor shed;"
4777,DIRGE.,"If wretched, pray with me; if on dark deeds"
4778,DIRGE.,"Intent, I am a most poor woman, cast"
4779,DIRGE.,Into the depths of mortal misery!
4780,DIRGE.,The desolate have nought to lose:--pass on!
4781,DIRGE.,"I had not spoken, but for Harold's name,"
4782,DIRGE.,By thee pronounced: it sounded in my ears                         180
4783,DIRGE.,"As of a better world--ah, no! of days"
4784,DIRGE.,"Of happiness in this. Whence, who art thou?"
4785,DIRGE.,"I am a Norman, woman; more to know                              183"
4786,DIRGE.,"Seek not:--and I have been to Harold's grave,"
4787,DIRGE.,Remembering that the mightiest are but dust;
4788,DIRGE.,And I have prayed the peace of God might rest
4789,DIRGE.,Upon his soul.
4790,DIRGE.,"And, by our blessed Lord,"
4791,DIRGE.,"The deed was holy, that lone woman said;"
4792,DIRGE.,"And may the benediction of all saints,                            190"
4793,DIRGE.,"Whoe'er thou art, rest on thy head. But say,"
4794,DIRGE.,What perilous mischance hath hither led
4795,DIRGE.,Thy footsteps in an hour and night like this?
4796,DIRGE.,"Over his grave, of whom we spake, I heard"
4797,DIRGE.,"The mass-song sung. I knelt upon that grave,"
4798,DIRGE.,"And prayed for my own sins, I left the fane,"
4799,DIRGE.,And heard the chanted rite at distance die.
4800,DIRGE.,"Returning through these forest shades, with thoughts"
4801,DIRGE.,"Not of this world, I pressed my panting steed,"
4802,DIRGE.,"The foremost of the Norman knights, and passed                    200"
4803,DIRGE.,"The track, that, leading to the forest-ford,"
4804,DIRGE.,Winds through the opening thickets; on a height
4805,DIRGE.,"I stood and listened, but no voice replied:"
4806,DIRGE.,The storm descended; at the lightning's flash
4807,DIRGE.,"My good steed burst the reins, and frantic fled."
4808,DIRGE.,I was alone: the small and craggy path
4809,DIRGE.,"Led to this solitary glen; and here,"
4810,DIRGE.,"As dark and troubled thoughts arose, I mused"
4811,DIRGE.,"Upon the dead man's sleep; for God, I thought,"
4812,DIRGE.,This night spoke in the rocking of the winds!                     210
4813,DIRGE.,"There is a Judge in heaven, the woman said,"
4814,DIRGE.,"Who seeth all things; and there is a voice,"
4815,DIRGE.,"Inaudible 'midst the tumultuous world,"
4816,DIRGE.,That speaks of fear or comfort to the heart
4817,DIRGE.,When all is still! But shroud thee in this cave
4818,DIRGE.,Till morning: such a sojourn may not please
4819,DIRGE.,"A courtly knight, like echoing halls of joy.                      217"
4820,DIRGE.,"I have but some wild roots, a bed of fern,"
4821,DIRGE.,"And no companion save this bloodhound here,"
4822,DIRGE.,"Who, at my beck, would tear thee to the earth;"
4823,DIRGE.,Yet enter--fear not! And that poor abode
4824,DIRGE.,"The proud knight entered, with rain-drenched plume."
4825,DIRGE.,"Yet here I dwell in peace, the woman said,"
4826,DIRGE.,"Remote from towns, nor start at the dire sound"
4827,DIRGE.,"Of that accursed curfew! Soldier-knight,"
4828,DIRGE.,Thou art a Norman! Had the invader spurned
4829,DIRGE.,"All charities in thy own native land,"
4830,DIRGE.,"Yes, thou wouldst know what injured Britons feel!"
4831,DIRGE.,"Nay, Englishwoman, thou dost wrong our king,"
4832,DIRGE.,The knight replied: conspiracy and fraud                          230
4833,DIRGE.,"Hourly surrounding him, at last compelled"
4834,DIRGE.,Stern rigour to awake. What! shall the bird
4835,DIRGE.,"Of thunder slumber on the citadel,"
4836,DIRGE.,"And blench his eye of fire, when, looking down,"
4837,DIRGE.,"He sees, in ceaseless enmity combined,"
4838,DIRGE.,"Those who would pluck his feathers from his breast,"
4839,DIRGE.,"And cast them to the winds! Woman, on thee,"
4840,DIRGE.,"Haply, the tempest of the times has beat"
4841,DIRGE.,Too roughly; but thy griefs he can requite.
4842,DIRGE.,"The indignant woman answered, He requite!                       240"
4843,DIRGE.,Can he bring back the dead? Can he restore
4844,DIRGE.,Joy to the broken-hearted? He requite!
4845,DIRGE.,Can he pour plenty on the vales his frown
4846,DIRGE.,"Has blasted, bid sweet evening hear again"
4847,DIRGE.,"The village pipe, and the fair flowers revive"
4848,DIRGE.,"His bloody footstep crushed? For poverty,"
4849,DIRGE.,"I reck it not: what is to me the night,"
4850,DIRGE.,"Spent cheerless, and in gloom and solitude?"
4851,DIRGE.,"I fix my eye upon that crucifix,"
4852,DIRGE.,"I mourn for those that are not--for my brave,                     250"
4853,DIRGE.,My buried countrymen! Of this no more!                            251
4854,DIRGE.,Thou art a foe; but a brave soldier-knight
4855,DIRGE.,Would scorn to wrong a woman; and if death
4856,DIRGE.,"Could arm my hand this moment, thou wert safe"
4857,DIRGE.,In a poor cottage as in royal halls.
4858,DIRGE.,Here rest a while till morning dawns--the way
4859,DIRGE.,"No mortal could retrace:--'twill not be long,"
4860,DIRGE.,And I can cheat the time with some old strain;
4861,DIRGE.,"For, Norman though thou art, thy soul has felt"
4862,DIRGE.,"Even as a man, when sacred sympathy                               260"
4863,DIRGE.,This morning led thee to King Harold's grave.
4864,DIRGE.,"The woman sat beside the hearth, and stirred"
4865,DIRGE.,"The embers, or with fern or brushwood raised"
4866,DIRGE.,"A fitful flame, but cautious, lest its light"
4867,DIRGE.,"Some roving forester might mark. At times,"
4868,DIRGE.,"The small and trembling blaze shone on her face,"
4869,DIRGE.,"Still beautiful, and showed the dark eye's fire"
4870,DIRGE.,"Beneath her long black locks. When she stood up,"
4871,DIRGE.,"A dignity, though in the garb of want,"
4872,DIRGE.,"Seemed round her, chiefly when the brushwood-blaze                270"
4873,DIRGE.,"Glanced through the gloom, and touched the dusky mail"
4874,DIRGE.,Of the strange knight; then with sad smile she sung:
4875,DIRGE.,
4876,DIRGE.,"Oh! when 'tis summer weather,"
4877,DIRGE.,"And the yellow bee, with fairy sound,"
4878,DIRGE.,"The waters clear is humming round,"
4879,DIRGE.,"And the cuckoo sings unseen,"
4880,DIRGE.,And the leaves are waving green--
4881,DIRGE.,"Oh! then 'tis sweet,"
4882,DIRGE.,"In some remote retreat,"
4883,DIRGE.,"To hear the murmuring dove,                                  280"
4884,DIRGE.,"With those whom on earth alone we love,"
4885,DIRGE.,And to wind through the greenwood together.
4886,DIRGE.,"But when 'tis winter weather,                               283"
4887,DIRGE.,"And crosses grieve,"
4888,DIRGE.,"And friends deceive,"
4889,DIRGE.,And rain and sleet
4890,DIRGE.,"The lattice beat,--"
4891,DIRGE.,Oh! then 'tis sweet
4892,DIRGE.,To sit and sing
4893,DIRGE.,"Of the friends with whom, in the days of spring,             290"
4894,DIRGE.,We roamed through the greenwood together.
4895,DIRGE.,
4896,DIRGE.,The bloodhound slept upon the hearth; he raised
4897,DIRGE.,"His head, and, through the dusk, his eyes were seen,"
4898,DIRGE.,"Fiery, a moment; but again he slept,"
4899,DIRGE.,When she her song renewed.
4900,DIRGE.,
4901,DIRGE.,Though thy words might well deceive me--
4902,DIRGE.,That is past--subdued I bend;
4903,DIRGE.,"Yet, for mercy, do not leave me"
4904,DIRGE.,To the world without a friend!
4905,DIRGE.,"Oh! thou art gone! and would, with thee,                      300"
4906,DIRGE.,Remembrance too had fled!
4907,DIRGE.,"She lives to bid me weep, and see"
4908,DIRGE.,The wreath I cherished dead.
4909,DIRGE.,
4910,DIRGE.,"The knight, through the dim lattice, watched the clouds"
4911,DIRGE.,"Of morn, now slowly struggling in the east,"
4912,DIRGE.,"When, with a voice more thrilling, and an air"
4913,DIRGE.,"Wilder, again a sad song she intoned:"
4914,DIRGE.,
4915,DIRGE.,"Upon the field of blood,"
4916,DIRGE.,"Amidst the bleeding brave,"
4917,DIRGE.,O'er his pale corse I stood--                             310
4918,DIRGE.,But he is in his grave!
4919,DIRGE.,"I wiped his gory brow,                                    312"
4920,DIRGE.,I smoothed his clotted hair--
4921,DIRGE.,"But he is at peace, in the cold ground now;"
4922,DIRGE.,Oh! when shall we meet there?
4923,DIRGE.,
4924,DIRGE.,"At once, horns, trumpets, and the shouts of men,"
4925,DIRGE.,"Were heard above the valley. At the sound,"
4926,DIRGE.,"The knight, upstarting from his dreamy trance,"
4927,DIRGE.,"High raised his vizor, and his bugle rang,"
4928,DIRGE.,"Answering. By God in heaven, thou art the king!                   320"
4929,DIRGE.,The woman said. Again the clarions rung:
4930,DIRGE.,"Like lightning, Alain and Montgomerie"
4931,DIRGE.,"Spurred through the wood, and led a harnessed steed"
4932,DIRGE.,"To the lone cabin's entrance, whilst the train"
4933,DIRGE.,"Sent up a deafening shout, Long live the king!"
4934,DIRGE.,"He, ere he vaulted to the saddle-bow,"
4935,DIRGE.,"Turned with a look benevolent, and cried,"
4936,DIRGE.,"Barons and lords, to this poor woman here"
4937,DIRGE.,Haply I owe my life! Let her not need!
4938,DIRGE.,"Away! she cried, king of these realms, away!                    330"
4939,DIRGE.,"I ask not wealth nor pity--least from thee,"
4940,DIRGE.,"Of all men. As the day began to dawn,"
4941,DIRGE.,More fixed and dreadful seemed her steadfast look;
4942,DIRGE.,The long black hair upon her labouring breast
4943,DIRGE.,"Streamed, whilst her neck, as in disdain, she raised,"
4944,DIRGE.,"Swelling, her eyes a wild terrific light"
4945,DIRGE.,"Shot, and her voice, with intonation deep,"
4946,DIRGE.,"Uttered a curse, that even the bloodhound crouched"
4947,DIRGE.,"Beneath her feet, whilst with stern look she spoke:"
4948,DIRGE.,Yes! I am Editha! she whom he loved--                             340
4949,DIRGE.,"She whom thy sword has left in solitude,"
4950,DIRGE.,"How desolate! Yes, I am Editha!"
4951,DIRGE.,"And thou hast been to Harold's grave--oh! think,"
4952,DIRGE.,"King, where thy own will be! He rests in peace;"
4953,DIRGE.,But even a spot is to thy bones denied;                           345
4954,DIRGE.,I see thy carcase trodden under foot;
4955,DIRGE.,"Thy children--his, with filial reverence,"
4956,DIRGE.,"Still think upon the spot where he is laid,"
4957,DIRGE.,"Though distant and far severed--but thy son,[101]"
4958,DIRGE.,"Thy eldest born, ah! see, he lifts the sword                      350"
4959,DIRGE.,"Against his father's breast! Hark, hark! the chase"
4960,DIRGE.,Is up! in that wild forest thou hast made!
4961,DIRGE.,The deer is flying--the loud horn resounds--
4962,DIRGE.,"Hurrah! the arrow that laid Harold low,"
4963,DIRGE.,"It flies, it trembles in the Red King's heart![102]"
4964,DIRGE.,"Norman, Heaven's hand is on thee, and the curse"
4965,DIRGE.,"Of this devoted land! Hence, to thy throne!"
4966,DIRGE.,"The king a moment with compassion gazed,"
4967,DIRGE.,"And now the clarions, and the horns, and trumps"
4968,DIRGE.,Rang louder; the bright banners in the winds                      360
4969,DIRGE.,Waved beautiful; the neighing steeds aloft
4970,DIRGE.,"Mantled their manes, and up the valley flew,"
4971,DIRGE.,"And soon have left behind the glen, the cave"
4972,DIRGE.,"Of solitary Editha, and sounds"
4973,DIRGE.,Of her last agony!
4974,DIRGE.,"Montgomerie,"
4975,DIRGE.,"King William, turning, cried, when this whole land"
4976,DIRGE.,Is portioned (for till then we may not hope
4977,DIRGE.,For lasting peace) forget not Editha.[103]
4978,DIRGE.,"In the gray beam the spires of London shone,                    370"
4979,DIRGE.,And the proud banner on the bastion
4980,DIRGE.,"Of William's tower was seen above the Thames,"
4981,DIRGE.,"As the gay train, slow winding through the woods,"
4982,DIRGE.,"Approached; when, lo! with spurs of blood, and voice"
4983,DIRGE.,"Faltering, upon a steed, whose labouring chest"
4984,DIRGE.,"Heaved, and whose bit was wet with blood and froth,               376"
4985,DIRGE.,A courier met them.
4986,DIRGE.,"York, O king! he cried,"
4987,DIRGE.,York is in ashes!--all thy Normans slain!
4988,DIRGE.,"Now, by the splendour of the throne of God,                       380"
4989,DIRGE.,"King William cried, nor woman, man, nor child,"
4990,DIRGE.,"Shall live! Terrific flashed his eye of fire,"
4991,DIRGE.,"And darker grew his frown; then, looking up,"
4992,DIRGE.,"He drew his sword, and with a vow to Heaven,"
4993,DIRGE.,"Amid his barons, to the trumpet's clang"
4994,DIRGE.,Rode onward (breathing vengeance) to the Tower.

5057,FOURTH HAG.,What tidings? O'er the seas the Danes are fled;
5058,FOURTH HAG.,"Morcar and Edwin in Northumberland,"
5059,FOURTH HAG.,"Amidst its wildest mountains, seek to hide"

5068,FOURTH HAG.,"The west wind blows, the boat is on the beach,"
5069,FOURTH HAG.,"The clansmen all embarked, the pipe is heard,"

5071,FOURTH HAG.,Linger the last upon the shore; and there
5072,FOURTH HAG.,"Are Harold's children, the gray-headed monk,"
5073,FOURTH HAG.,"Godwin, and Edmund, and poor Adela."
5074,FOURTH HAG.,"Then Malcolm spoke: The lot is cast! oh, fly"

5076,FOURTH HAG.,"Amidst our lakes and mountains! Adela,                             60"
5077,FOURTH HAG.,"Atheling whispered, does thy heart say Yes?"
5078,FOURTH HAG.,For in this world we ne'er may meet again.
5079,FOURTH HAG.,"The brief hour calls--come, Adela, exclaimed"
5080,FOURTH HAG.,"Malcolm, and kindly took her hand. She looked"
5081,FOURTH HAG.,"To heaven, and fell upon her knees, then rose,"
5082,FOURTH HAG.,And answered:
5083,FOURTH HAG.,"Sire, when my brave father fell,"
5084,FOURTH HAG.,We three were exiles on a distant shore;
5085,FOURTH HAG.,"And never, or in solitude or courts,"

5087,FOURTH HAG.,When those whom I had loved from infancy
5088,FOURTH HAG.,"Here joined the din of arms, I came with them;"
5089,FOURTH HAG.,"With them I have partaken good and ill,                            73"
5090,FOURTH HAG.,"Have in the self-same mother's lap been laid,"
5091,FOURTH HAG.,"The same eye gazed on us with tenderness,"
5092,FOURTH HAG.,And the same mother prayed prosperity
5093,FOURTH HAG.,Might still be ours through life! Alas! our lot
5094,FOURTH HAG.,How different!
5095,FOURTH HAG.,"Yet let them go with you,"
5096,FOURTH HAG.,"I argue not--the first time in our lives,                          80"
5097,FOURTH HAG.,"If it be so, we here shall separate;"
5098,FOURTH HAG.,"Whatever fate betide, I will not go"
5099,FOURTH HAG.,Till I have knelt upon my father's grave!
5100,FOURTH HAG.,"'Tis perilous to think, Atheling cried,"
5101,FOURTH HAG.,Most perilous--how 'scape the Norman's eye?
5102,FOURTH HAG.,"She turned, and with a solemn calmness said:"
5103,FOURTH HAG.,"If we should perish, at the hour of death"
5104,FOURTH HAG.,"My father will look down from heaven, and say,"
5105,FOURTH HAG.,"Come, my poor child! oh, come where I am blessed!"
5106,FOURTH HAG.,"My brothers, seek your safety. Here I stand                        90"
5107,FOURTH HAG.,Resolved; and never will I leave these shores
5108,FOURTH HAG.,Till I have knelt upon my father's grave!
5109,FOURTH HAG.,We never will forsake thee! Godwin cried.
5110,FOURTH HAG.,"Let death betide, said Edmund, we will go,"
5111,FOURTH HAG.,"Yes! go with thee, or perish!"
5112,FOURTH HAG.,"As he spoke,"
5113,FOURTH HAG.,The pilot gave the signal. Then farewell!
5114,FOURTH HAG.,"King Malcolm cried, friends lately met, and now"
5115,FOURTH HAG.,To part for ever! and he kissed the cheek
5116,FOURTH HAG.,"Of Adela, and took brave Godwin's hand                            100"
5117,FOURTH HAG.,"And Edmund's, and then said, almost in tears,"
5118,FOURTH HAG.,It is not now too late! yet o'er my grave
5119,FOURTH HAG.,So might a duteous daughter weep! God speed
5120,FOURTH HAG.,Brave Malcolm to his father's land! they cried.
5121,FOURTH HAG.,The ships beyond the promontory's point
5122,FOURTH HAG.,"Were anchored, and the tide was ebbing fast."
5123,FOURTH HAG.,"Then Ailric: Sire, not unforeseen by me                         107"
5124,FOURTH HAG.,"Was this sad day. Oh! King of Scotland, hear!"
5125,FOURTH HAG.,I was a brother of that holy house
5126,FOURTH HAG.,Where Harold's bones are buried; from my vows
5127,FOURTH HAG.,"I was absolved, and followed--for I loved"
5128,FOURTH HAG.,His children--followed them through every fate.
5129,FOURTH HAG.,"My few gray hairs will soon descend in peace,"
5130,FOURTH HAG.,"When I shall be forgotten; but till then,"
5131,FOURTH HAG.,"My services, my last poor services,"
5132,FOURTH HAG.,"To them I have devoted, for the sake"
5133,FOURTH HAG.,"Of him, their father, and my king, to whom"
5134,FOURTH HAG.,"All in this world I owed! Protect them, Lord,"
5135,FOURTH HAG.,"And bless them, when the turf is on my head;"
5136,FOURTH HAG.,"And, in their old age, may they sometimes think                   120"
5137,FOURTH HAG.,"Of Ailric, cold and shrouded in his grave,"
5138,FOURTH HAG.,"When summer smiles! Sire, listen whilst I pray"
5139,FOURTH HAG.,One boon of thy compassion: not for me--
5140,FOURTH HAG.,I reck not whether vengeance wake or sleep--
5141,FOURTH HAG.,But for the safety of this innocent maid
5142,FOURTH HAG.,"I speak. South of the Humber, in a cave,"
5143,FOURTH HAG.,"Concealed amidst the rocks and tangled brakes,"
5144,FOURTH HAG.,I have deposited some needful weeds
5145,FOURTH HAG.,"For this sad hour; for well, indeed, I knew,"
5146,FOURTH HAG.,"If all should fail, this maiden's last resolve,                   130"
5147,FOURTH HAG.,"To kneel upon her father's grave, or die."
5148,FOURTH HAG.,For this I have provided; but the time
5149,FOURTH HAG.,"Is precious, and the sun is westering slow;"
5150,FOURTH HAG.,The fierce eye of the lion may be turned
5151,FOURTH HAG.,"Upon this spot to-morrow! Adela,"
5152,FOURTH HAG.,"Now hear your friend, your father! The fleet hour"
5153,FOURTH HAG.,"Is passing, never to return: oh, seize"
5154,FOURTH HAG.,"The instant! Thou, King Malcolm, grant my prayer!"
5155,FOURTH HAG.,"If we embark, and leave the shores this night,"
5156,FOURTH HAG.,"The voice of fame will bruit it far and wide,                     140"
5157,FOURTH HAG.,"That Harold's children fled with thee, and sought                 141"
5158,FOURTH HAG.,A refuge in thy kingdom. None will know
5159,FOURTH HAG.,"Our destination. In thy boat conveyed,"
5160,FOURTH HAG.,We may be landed near the rocky cave;
5161,FOURTH HAG.,"The boat again ply to thy ships, and they"
5162,FOURTH HAG.,"Plough homeward the north seas, whilst we are left"
5163,FOURTH HAG.,To fate. Again the pilot's voice was heard;
5164,FOURTH HAG.,"And, o'er the sand-hills, an approaching file"
5165,FOURTH HAG.,"Of Norman soldiers, with projected spears,"
5166,FOURTH HAG.,Already seemed as rushing on their prey.                          150
5167,FOURTH HAG.,Then Ailric took the hand of Adela;
5168,FOURTH HAG.,"She and her brothers, and young Atheling,"
5169,FOURTH HAG.,"And Scotland's king, are in one boat embarked."
5170,FOURTH HAG.,"Meantime the sun sets red, and twilight shades"
5171,FOURTH HAG.,The sinking hills. The solitary boat
5172,FOURTH HAG.,Has reached the adverse shore.
5173,FOURTH HAG.,"Here, then, we part!"
5174,FOURTH HAG.,"King Malcolm said; and every voice replied,"
5175,FOURTH HAG.,God speed brave Malcolm to his father's land!
5176,FOURTH HAG.,"Ailric, the brothers, and their sister, left                    160"
5177,FOURTH HAG.,"The boat; they stood upon the moonlit beach,"
5178,FOURTH HAG.,"Still listening to the sounds, as they grew faint,"
5179,FOURTH HAG.,"Of the receding oars, and watching still"
5180,FOURTH HAG.,"If one white streak at distance, as they dipped,"
5181,FOURTH HAG.,"Were seen, till all was solitude around."
5182,FOURTH HAG.,"Pensive, they sought a refuge for that night"
5183,FOURTH HAG.,In the bleak ocean-cave. The morning dawns;
5184,FOURTH HAG.,"The brothers have put off the plumes of war,"
5185,FOURTH HAG.,Dropping one tear upon the sword. Disguised
5186,FOURTH HAG.,"In garb to suit their fortunes, they appear                       170"
5187,FOURTH HAG.,"Like shipwrecked seamen of Armorica,"
5188,FOURTH HAG.,By a Franciscan hermit through the land
5189,FOURTH HAG.,"Led to St Alban's shrine, to offer vows,"
5190,FOURTH HAG.,Vows to the God who heard them in that hour
5191,FOURTH HAG.,When all beside had perished in the storm.                        175
5192,FOURTH HAG.,"Wrecked near his ocean-cave, an eremite"
5193,FOURTH HAG.,(So went the tale of their disastrous fate)
5194,FOURTH HAG.,"Sustained them, and now guides them through a land"
5195,FOURTH HAG.,Of strangers. That fair boy was wont to sing
5196,FOURTH HAG.,"Upon the mast, when the still ship went slow                      180"
5197,FOURTH HAG.,"Along the seas, in sunshine; and that garb"
5198,FOURTH HAG.,"Conceals the lovely, light-haired Adela."
5199,FOURTH HAG.,The cuckoo's note in the deep woods was heard
5200,FOURTH HAG.,"When forth, they fared. At many a convent gate"
5201,FOURTH HAG.,"They stood and prayed for shelter, and their pace"
5202,FOURTH HAG.,"Hastened, if, high amid the clouds, they marked"
5203,FOURTH HAG.,Some solitary castle lift its brow
5204,FOURTH HAG.,"Gray in the distance--hastened, so to reach,"
5205,FOURTH HAG.,"Ere it grew dark, its hospitable towers."
5206,FOURTH HAG.,There the lithe minstrel sung his roundelay:                      190
5207,FOURTH HAG.,
5208,FOURTH HAG.,"Listen, lords and ladies bright!"
5209,FOURTH HAG.,I can sing of many a knight
5210,FOURTH HAG.,Who fought in paynim lands afar;
5211,FOURTH HAG.,"Of Bevis, or of Iscapar."
5212,FOURTH HAG.,"I have tales of wandering maids,"
5213,FOURTH HAG.,"And fairy elves in haunted glades,"
5214,FOURTH HAG.,Of phantom-troops that silent ride
5215,FOURTH HAG.,By the moonlit forest's side.
5216,FOURTH HAG.,"I have songs (fair maidens, hear!)"
5217,FOURTH HAG.,To warn the lovelorn lady's ear.                             200
5218,FOURTH HAG.,"The choice of all my treasures take,"
5219,FOURTH HAG.,And grant us food for pity's sake!
5220,FOURTH HAG.,
5221,FOURTH HAG.,"When tired, at noon, by the white waterfall,"
5222,FOURTH HAG.,"In some romantic and secluded glen,"
5223,FOURTH HAG.,"They sat, and heard the blackbird overhead"
5224,FOURTH HAG.,"Singing, unseen, a song, such as they heard"
5225,FOURTH HAG.,In infancy.[105] So every vernal morn                             207
5226,FOURTH HAG.,"Brought with it scents of flowers, or songs of birds,"
5227,FOURTH HAG.,"Mingled with many shapings of old things,"
5228,FOURTH HAG.,"And days gone by. Then up again, to scale"
5229,FOURTH HAG.,"The airy mountain, and behold the plain"
5230,FOURTH HAG.,"Stretching below, and fading far away,"
5231,FOURTH HAG.,How beautiful; yet still to feel a tear
5232,FOURTH HAG.,"Starting, even when it shone most beautiful,"
5233,FOURTH HAG.,"To think, Here, in the country of our birth,"
5234,FOURTH HAG.,No rest is ours!
5235,FOURTH HAG.,"On, to our father's grave!"
5236,FOURTH HAG.,So southward through the country they had passed
5237,FOURTH HAG.,"Now many days, and casual shelter found"
5238,FOURTH HAG.,"In villages, or hermit's lonely cave,                             220"
5239,FOURTH HAG.,"Or castle, high embattled on the point"
5240,FOURTH HAG.,"Of some steep mountain, or in convent walls;"
5241,FOURTH HAG.,"For most with pity heard his song, and marked"
5242,FOURTH HAG.,The countenance of the wayfaring boy;
5243,FOURTH HAG.,"Or when the pale monk, with his folded hands"
5244,FOURTH HAG.,"Upon his breast, prayed, For the love of God,"
5245,FOURTH HAG.,"Pity the poor, give alms; and bade them speed!"
5246,FOURTH HAG.,"And now, in distant light, the pinnacles"
5247,FOURTH HAG.,"Of a gray fane appeared, whilst on the woods"
5248,FOURTH HAG.,"Still evening shed its parting light. Oh, say,                    230"
5249,FOURTH HAG.,"Say, villager, what towers are those that rise"
5250,FOURTH HAG.,Eastward beyond the alders?
5251,FOURTH HAG.,"Know ye not,"
5252,FOURTH HAG.,"He answered, Waltham Abbey? Harold there"
5253,FOURTH HAG.,Is buried--he who in the fight was slain
5254,FOURTH HAG.,At Hastings! To the cheek of Adela
5255,FOURTH HAG.,A deadly paleness came. On--let us on!
5256,FOURTH HAG.,"Faintly she cried, and held her brother's arm,"
5257,FOURTH HAG.,And hid her face a moment with her hand.
5258,FOURTH HAG.,And now the massy portal's sculptured arch                        240
5259,FOURTH HAG.,Before them rose.
5260,FOURTH HAG.,"Say, porter, Ailric cried,"
5261,FOURTH HAG.,"Poor mariners, wrecked on the northern shores,"
5262,FOURTH HAG.,Ask charity. Does aged Osgood live?
5263,FOURTH HAG.,"Tell him a poor Franciscan, wandering far,"
5264,FOURTH HAG.,"And wearied, for the love of God would ask"
5265,FOURTH HAG.,His charity.
5266,FOURTH HAG.,Osgood came slowly forth;
5267,FOURTH HAG.,The light that touched the western turret fell
5268,FOURTH HAG.,On his pale face. The pilgrim-father said:                        250
5269,FOURTH HAG.,I am your brother Ailric--look on me!
5270,FOURTH HAG.,And these are Harold's children!
5271,FOURTH HAG.,"Whilst he spoke,"
5272,FOURTH HAG.,"Godwin, advancing, with emotion cried,"
5273,FOURTH HAG.,"We are his children! I am Godwin, this"
5274,FOURTH HAG.,"Is Edmund, and, lo! poor and in disguise,"
5275,FOURTH HAG.,Our sister! We would kneel upon his grave--
5276,FOURTH HAG.,Our father's!
5277,FOURTH HAG.,"Come yet nearer, Osgood said,"
5278,FOURTH HAG.,Yet nearer! and that instant Adela                                260
5279,FOURTH HAG.,"Looked up, and wiping from her eyes a tear,"
5280,FOURTH HAG.,Have you forgotten Adela?
5281,FOURTH HAG.,O God!
5282,FOURTH HAG.,"The old man trembling cried, ye are indeed"
5283,FOURTH HAG.,"Our benefactor's children! Adela,"
5284,FOURTH HAG.,"Edmund, brave Godwin! welcome to these walls--"
5285,FOURTH HAG.,"Welcome, my old companion! and he fell"
5286,FOURTH HAG.,"Upon the neck of Ailric, and both wept."
5287,FOURTH HAG.,Then Osgood: Children of that honoured lord
5288,FOURTH HAG.,"Who gave us all, go near and bless his grave.                     270"
5289,FOURTH HAG.,One parting sunbeam yet upon the floor
5290,FOURTH HAG.,"Rested--it passed away, and darker gloom"
5291,FOURTH HAG.,Was gathering in the aisles. Each footstep's sound
5292,FOURTH HAG.,"Was more distinctly heard, for all beside                         274"
5293,FOURTH HAG.,Was silent. Slow along the glimmering fane
5294,FOURTH HAG.,"They passed, like shadows risen from the tombs."
5295,FOURTH HAG.,"The entrance-door was closed, lest aught intrude"
5296,FOURTH HAG.,Upon the sanctity of this sad hour.
5297,FOURTH HAG.,"The inner choir they enter, part in shade"
5298,FOURTH HAG.,"And part in light, for now the rising moon                        280"
5299,FOURTH HAG.,"Began to glance upon the shrines, and tombs,"
5300,FOURTH HAG.,"And pillars. Trembling through the windows high,"
5301,FOURTH HAG.,"One beam, a moment, on that cold gray stone"
5302,FOURTH HAG.,"Is flung--the word ""Infelix""[106] is scarce seen."
5303,FOURTH HAG.,Behold his gravestone! Osgood said. Each eye
5304,FOURTH HAG.,"Was turned. A while intent they gazed, then knelt"
5305,FOURTH HAG.,"Before the altar, on the marble stone!"
5306,FOURTH HAG.,No sound was heard through all the dim expanse
5307,FOURTH HAG.,"Of the vast building, none but of the air"
5308,FOURTH HAG.,"That came in dying echoes up the aisle,                           290"
5309,FOURTH HAG.,Like whispers heard at the confessional.
5310,FOURTH HAG.,"Thus Harold's children, hand in hand, knelt down--"
5311,FOURTH HAG.,"Upon their father's grave knelt down, and prayed:"
5312,FOURTH HAG.,"Have mercy on his soul--have mercy, Lord!"
5313,FOURTH HAG.,"They knelt a lengthened space, and bowed their heads,"
5314,FOURTH HAG.,"Some natural tears they shed, and crossed their breasts;"
5315,FOURTH HAG.,"Then rising slowly up, looked round, and saw"
5316,FOURTH HAG.,"A monk approaching near, unmarked before;"
5317,FOURTH HAG.,And in the further distance the tall form
5318,FOURTH HAG.,As of a female. He who wore the hood                              300
5319,FOURTH HAG.,And habit of a monk approached and spoke:
5320,FOURTH HAG.,Brothers! beloved sister! know ye not
5321,FOURTH HAG.,These features?--and he raised his hood--Behold
5322,FOURTH HAG.,"Me--me, your brother Marcus! whom these weeds,"
5323,FOURTH HAG.,"Since last we met, have hidden from the world:"
5324,FOURTH HAG.,Let me kneel with you here!
5325,FOURTH HAG.,When Adela                      407
5326,FOURTH HAG.,"Beheld him, she exclaimed, Oh! do we meet"
5327,FOURTH HAG.,"Here, my lost brother, o'er a father's grave?"
5328,FOURTH HAG.,"You live, restored a moment in this world,"
5329,FOURTH HAG.,To us as from the grave! And Godwin took
5330,FOURTH HAG.,"His hand, and said, My brother, tell us all;"
5331,FOURTH HAG.,How have you lived unknown? Oh! tell us all!
5332,FOURTH HAG.,"When in that grave our father, he replied,"
5333,FOURTH HAG.,"Was laid, ye fled, and I in this sad land"
5334,FOURTH HAG.,Remained to cope with fortune. To these walls
5335,FOURTH HAG.,"I came, when Ailric, from his vows absolved,"
5336,FOURTH HAG.,"With you was wandering. None my lineage knew,"
5337,FOURTH HAG.,"Or name, but I some time had won regard"
5338,FOURTH HAG.,"From the superior. Osgood knew me not,                            420"
5339,FOURTH HAG.,For with Earl Edwin I had lived from youth.
5340,FOURTH HAG.,To our superior thus I knelt and prayed:
5341,FOURTH HAG.,"Sir, I beseech you, for the love of God,"
5342,FOURTH HAG.,"And of our Lady Mary, and St John,"
5343,FOURTH HAG.,You would receive me here to live and die
5344,FOURTH HAG.,Among you. What most moved my heart to take
5345,FOURTH HAG.,"The vows was this, that here, from day to day,"
5346,FOURTH HAG.,"From year to year, within the walls he raised,"
5347,FOURTH HAG.,I might behold my father's grave. This eve
5348,FOURTH HAG.,"I sat in the confessional, unseen,                                430"
5349,FOURTH HAG.,"When you approached. I scarce restrained the tear,"
5350,FOURTH HAG.,"From many recollections, when I heard"
5351,FOURTH HAG.,"A tale of sorrow and of sin. Come near,"
5352,FOURTH HAG.,Woman of woe!--and a wan woman stood
5353,FOURTH HAG.,"Before them, tall and stately; her dark eyes"
5354,FOURTH HAG.,"Shone, as the uncertain lamp cast a brief glare,"
5355,FOURTH HAG.,"And showed her neck, and raven hair, and lips"
5356,FOURTH HAG.,"Moving. She spoke not, but advanced and knelt--"
5357,FOURTH HAG.,"She, too--on Harold's grave; then prayed aloud,"
5358,FOURTH HAG.,"O God, be merciful to him--and me!                                440"
5359,FOURTH HAG.,Who art thou? Godwin cried.
5360,FOURTH HAG.,Ah! know ye not
5361,FOURTH HAG.,The wretched Editha? No children's love
5362,FOURTH HAG.,Could equal mine! I trod among the dead--
5363,FOURTH HAG.,"Did I not, fathers?--trod among the dead"
5364,FOURTH HAG.,"From corse to corse, or saw men's dying eyes"
5365,FOURTH HAG.,"Fixed upon mine, and heard such groans as yet"
5366,FOURTH HAG.,"Rive, with remembrance, my torn heart: I found"
5367,FOURTH HAG.,"Him who rests here, where then he lay in blood!"
5368,FOURTH HAG.,"When he was buried, I beheld the rites                            450"
5369,FOURTH HAG.,"At distance, and with broken heart retired"
5370,FOURTH HAG.,To the wild woods; there I have lived unseen
5371,FOURTH HAG.,"From that sad hour. Late when the tempest rocked,"
5372,FOURTH HAG.,"At midnight, a proud soldier shelter sought"
5373,FOURTH HAG.,In my lone cell; 'twas when the storm was heard
5374,FOURTH HAG.,"Through the deep forest, and he too had knelt"
5375,FOURTH HAG.,At Harold's grave! Who was it? He! the king!
5376,FOURTH HAG.,"Say, fathers, was it not the hand of God"
5377,FOURTH HAG.,That led his footsteps there!--but has he learned
5378,FOURTH HAG.,Humility? Oh! ask this bleeding land!                             460
5379,FOURTH HAG.,"Last night a phantom came to me in dreams,"
5380,FOURTH HAG.,"And a voice said, Come, visit my cold grave!"
5381,FOURTH HAG.,"I came, by some mysterious impulse led;"
5382,FOURTH HAG.,"I heard the even song, and when the sound"
5383,FOURTH HAG.,"Had ceased, and all departed, save one monk,"
5384,FOURTH HAG.,"Who stood and gazed upon this grave alone,"
5385,FOURTH HAG.,"I prayed that he would hear me, at this hour,"
5386,FOURTH HAG.,"Confess my secret sins, for my full heart"
5387,FOURTH HAG.,Was labouring. It was Harold's son who sat
5388,FOURTH HAG.,"In the confessional, to me unknown;                               470"
5389,FOURTH HAG.,But all is now revealed--and lo! I stand
5390,FOURTH HAG.,Before you!
5391,FOURTH HAG.,"As she spoke, a thrilling awe                     473"
5392,FOURTH HAG.,Came to each heart: loftier she seemed to stand
5393,FOURTH HAG.,"In the dim moonlight; sorrowful, yet stern,"
5394,FOURTH HAG.,Her aspect; and her breast was seen to beat;
5395,FOURTH HAG.,"Her eyes were fixed, and shone with fearful light."
5396,FOURTH HAG.,"She raised her right hand, and her dark hair fell"
5397,FOURTH HAG.,"Upon her neck, whilst all, scarce breathing, heard:"
5398,FOURTH HAG.,My spirit labours! she exclaimed. This night!                     480
5399,FOURTH HAG.,The tomb! the altar! Ha! the vision strains
5400,FOURTH HAG.,My senses to oppression! Marked ye not
5401,FOURTH HAG.,The trodden throne restored--the Saxon line[107]
5402,FOURTH HAG.,Of England's monarchs bursting through the gloom?
5403,FOURTH HAG.,"Lady, I look on thee! In distant years,"
5404,FOURTH HAG.,"Even from the Northern throne which thou shalt share,[108]"
5405,FOURTH HAG.,"A warrior-monarch shall arise, whose arm,"
5406,FOURTH HAG.,"In concert with this country, now bowed low,"
5407,FOURTH HAG.,"Shall tear the eagle from a conqueror's grasp,"
5408,FOURTH HAG.,Far greater than this Norman!                                     490
5409,FOURTH HAG.,"Spare, O God!"
5410,FOURTH HAG.,"My burning brain! Then, with a shriek, she fell,"
5411,FOURTH HAG.,"Insensible, upon the Saxon's grave!"
5412,FOURTH HAG.,"They bore her from the fane; and Godwin said,"
5413,FOURTH HAG.,"Peace, peace be with her, now and evermore!"
5414,FOURTH HAG.,"He, taking Marcus by the hand, Yet here"
5415,FOURTH HAG.,"Thou shalt behold, behold from day to day,"
5416,FOURTH HAG.,This honoured grave! But where in the great world
5417,FOURTH HAG.,"Shall be thy place of rest, poor Adela?"
5418,FOURTH HAG.,"O God, be ever with her! Marcus cried,                            500"
5419,FOURTH HAG.,"With her, and you, my brothers! Here we part,"
5420,FOURTH HAG.,"Never to meet again. Whate'er your fate,"
5421,FOURTH HAG.,"I shall remember with a brother's love,"
5422,FOURTH HAG.,And pray for you; but all my spirit rests                         504
5423,FOURTH HAG.,"In other worlds--in worlds, oh! not like this!"
5424,FOURTH HAG.,Ye may return to this sad scene when I
5425,FOURTH HAG.,"Am dust and ashes; ye may yet return,"
5426,FOURTH HAG.,And visit this sad spot; perhaps when age
5427,FOURTH HAG.,Or grief has brought such change of heart as now
5428,FOURTH HAG.,"I feel, then shall you look upon my grave,                        510"
5429,FOURTH HAG.,And shed one tear for him whose latest prayer
5430,FOURTH HAG.,"Will be: Oh, bless you! bless my sister, Lord!"
5431,FOURTH HAG.,"Then Adela, with lifted look composed:"
5432,FOURTH HAG.,"Father, it is performed,--the duty vowed"
5433,FOURTH HAG.,"When we returned to this devoted land,"
5434,FOURTH HAG.,The last sad duty of a daughter's love!
5435,FOURTH HAG.,And now I go in peace--go to a world
5436,FOURTH HAG.,"Of sorrow, conscious that a father's voice"
5437,FOURTH HAG.,"Speaks to my soul, and that thine eye, O God!"
5438,FOURTH HAG.,"Whate'er the fortunes of our future days,                         520"
5439,FOURTH HAG.,"Is o'er us. Thou, direct our onward road!"
5440,FOURTH HAG.,"O'er the last Saxon's grave, old Osgood raised"
5441,FOURTH HAG.,His hands and prayed:
5442,FOURTH HAG.,"Father of heaven and earth,"
5443,FOURTH HAG.,All is beneath Thine eye! 'Tis ours to bend
5444,FOURTH HAG.,"In silence. Children of misfortune, loved,"
5445,FOURTH HAG.,"Revered--children of him who raised these roofs,"
5446,FOURTH HAG.,No home is found for you in this sad land;
5447,FOURTH HAG.,"And none, perhaps, may know the spot, or shed"
5448,FOURTH HAG.,A tear upon the earth where ye are laid!                          530
5449,FOURTH HAG.,"So saying, on their heads he placed his hands,"
5450,FOURTH HAG.,"And blessed them all; but, after pause, rejoined:"
5451,FOURTH HAG.,'Tis dangerous lingering here--the fire-eyed lynx
5452,FOURTH HAG.,"Would lap your blood! Westward, beyond the Lea,"
5453,FOURTH HAG.,There is a cell where ye may rest to-night.
5454,FOURTH HAG.,The portal opened; on the battlements
5455,FOURTH HAG.,"The moonlight shone, silent and beautiful!"
5456,FOURTH HAG.,Before them lay their path through the wide world--               538
5457,FOURTH HAG.,The nightingales were singing as they passed;
5458,FOURTH HAG.,"And, looking back upon the glimmering towers,"

5579,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"quarrell have ended their dayes, that it may be lawfull for us by"

5584,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"of our church by their helpe strengthened, may be the stronger, and"
5585,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"endure the firmer.' With whose so humble a request, and abundant"
5586,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"teares, the victorious and worthy Duke moved, answered:"
5587,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,
5588,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"""'Your King (said he) unmindfull of his faith, although he have for"
5589,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"the present endured the worthy punishment of his fault, yet hath he"
5590,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,not therefore deserved to want the honour of a sepulchre or to lie
5591,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"unburied: were it but that he died a King, howsoever he came by the"
5592,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"kingdom, my purpose is, for the reverence of him, and for the"
5593,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"health of them who, having left their wives and possessions, have"
5594,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"here in my quarrel lost their lives, to build here a church and a"
5595,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"monastery with an hundred monkes in it, to pray for them for ever,"
5596,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"and in the same church to bury your King above the rest, with all"

5599,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,
5600,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"""With which his courteous speech and promises, the two religious"
5601,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"fathers, comforted and encouraged, again replied:"
5602,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,
5603,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"""'Not so, noble Duke, but grant this thy servants' most humble"
5604,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"request, that we may, for God, by thy leave, receive the dead body"
5605,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"of our founder, and to bury it in the place which himself in his"
5606,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"lifetime appointed, that wee, cheered with the presence of his"
5607,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"body, may thereof take comfort, and that his tombe may be unto our"
5608,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,successors a perpetual monument of his remembrance.'
5609,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,
5610,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"""The Duke, as he was of disposition gracious, and inclined to"
5611,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"mercy, forthwith granted their desires, whereupon they drew out"
5612,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"stores of gold to present him in way of gratulation, which he not"
5613,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"only utterly refused, but also offered them plenty to supply"
5614,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"whatsoever should be needfull for the pompe of his funerall, as"
5615,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"also for their costs in travaile to and fro, giving strait"
5616,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,commandments that none of his souldiers should persume to molest
5617,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,them in this businesse or in their returne. Then went they in haste
5618,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"to the quarry of the dead, but by no meanes could find the body of"
5619,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"the King; for the countenances of all men greatly alter by death,"
5620,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"but being maimed and imbrued with bloud, they are not known to be"
5621,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,the men they were. As for his other regall ornaments which might
5622,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"have shewed him for their King, his dead corps was despoyled of"
5623,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"them, either through the greedy desire of prey (as the manner of"
5624,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"the field is) or to be the first bringer of such happy news, in"
5625,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"hope of a princely reward, upon which purpose many times the body"
5626,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"is both mangled and dismembred, and so was this King after his"
5627,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"death by a base souldier gasht and hackt into the legge, whom Duke"
5628,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"William rewarded for so unsouldier like a deed, cashiering him for"

5634,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"marks of his body, to her well knowne, found him out, and then put"
5635,ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED.,"into a coffine, was by divers of the Norman nobilitie honourably"

5841,PART FIRST.,His long locks and his white descending beard
5842,PART FIRST.,"Shook when he tottered down into the sun,"

5874,PART FIRST.,"Once heard on earth: so, pondering, on his staff,"

5899,PART FIRST.,I am the first and last; the last and first:

5904,PART FIRST.,The glory passed--and all around
5905,PART FIRST.,"Is still as death: the old man sinks to earth,"
5906,PART FIRST.,"Astonied, faint, and pale. When the slow sense"
5907,PART FIRST.,"Struggled to recollection, he looked around,"
5908,PART FIRST.,Yet trembling; but no voice was heard; no form
5909,PART FIRST.,"Stood, bending in its glory, o'er him."
5910,PART FIRST.,Then seemed the hills of that forsaken isle                       100
5911,PART FIRST.,More dreary; and the promontories bare
5912,PART FIRST.,Lifted their weather-beaten brows more dark

5914,PART FIRST.,"The old man passed; and, wrapped in thoughts of heaven,"
5915,PART FIRST.,Lifted in prayer his clasped emaciate hands;                      105
5916,PART FIRST.,Then on his bed of rushes in the cave
5917,PART FIRST.,Lay down to rest till dawn. What was his dream?

5920,PART FIRST.,His Saviour calmly bowing his meek head                           110

5922,PART FIRST.,"Even from the cross, Woman, behold thy son!"
5923,PART FIRST.,"Son, look upon thy mother!"

5925,PART FIRST.,"The forms of those whom he had loved on earth,"
5926,PART FIRST.,"And heard their voices still; and stood entranced,"
5927,PART FIRST.,"With Peter and with James, upon the mount"
5928,PART FIRST.,"Of glorious vision; now he saw, in dreams,"
5929,PART FIRST.,"Again the glistening apparition rise,"
5930,PART FIRST.,And stand above him. He has tarried long                          120
5931,PART FIRST.,And lonely in the world: the vision comes
5932,PART FIRST.,"To animate his hopes--to say, Live, live"
5933,PART FIRST.,"With me, for evermore! And, lo, the keys!"
5934,PART FIRST.,This opens the bright mansions of the blessed;
5935,PART FIRST.,"This closes the eternal gates of hell,"
5936,PART FIRST.,"Upon the gnashing of the teeth, and groans"
5937,PART FIRST.,"Unutterable. So the Saviour spoke,"
5938,PART FIRST.,As seemed in his sleep. Ah! the stern shade
5939,PART FIRST.,"Of murdered Cæsar rises: Art thou dead,"
5940,PART FIRST.,King of the world? for this didst thou proclaim                   130
5941,PART FIRST.,Thyself a god--a living god on earth?[120]
5942,PART FIRST.,Let the pit hide thee! But thou art a god!
5943,PART FIRST.,Then bid the fury of these flames assuage
5944,PART FIRST.,Ere they reach thee! Who shrieked?
5945,PART FIRST.,"At the sound,"
5946,PART FIRST.,The ancient and the solitary man
5947,PART FIRST.,Started from sleep
5948,PART FIRST.,"The cold gray dawn appeared,                     138"
5949,PART FIRST.,"When, standing opposite, with steadfast look,"
5950,PART FIRST.,"And in the glimmer of the inmost cave,"
5951,PART FIRST.,He saw a stranger.
5952,PART FIRST.,Whence and who art thou?
5953,PART FIRST.,With trembling voice he asked--whence? who art thou?
5954,PART FIRST.,Perhaps the spirit of this dismal isle!
5955,PART FIRST.,"Or, cast upon these melancholy rocks,"
5956,PART FIRST.,"A poor and world-forsaken thing, like me!"
5957,PART FIRST.,"The stranger gazed unmoved, and answered not:"
5958,PART FIRST.,His looks were those of pity--of respect--
5959,PART FIRST.,As mingling thoughtful wisdom with the grace
5960,PART FIRST.,Of beauty. In his hand he held a book:                            150
5961,PART FIRST.,He opened it; and never light appeared
5962,PART FIRST.,"So fair as that on his majestic brow,"
5963,PART FIRST.,"For now the sun had risen, and its beams"
5964,PART FIRST.,Shot far into the cave.
5965,PART FIRST.,John gazed with awe
5966,PART FIRST.,"On that majestic man, he knew not why;"
5967,PART FIRST.,"And well might he have gazed with reverence,"
5968,PART FIRST.,"For here, in this rude spot, he only saw"
5969,PART FIRST.,"Men the most dark and savage of their kind,"
5970,PART FIRST.,"Murderers, and ruthless criminals in chains.                      160"
5971,PART FIRST.,He spoke to them of truth and righteousness--
5972,PART FIRST.,He spoke of an offended God! Some looked
5973,PART FIRST.,"To the bright sun, defying; others turned"
5974,PART FIRST.,"Muttering. He spoke of pity, and they heard,"
5975,PART FIRST.,Even as the relentless hurricane
5976,PART FIRST.,"Hears the last prayer of the faint mariner,"
5977,PART FIRST.,Whom wintry waves had dashed upon the rocks.
5978,PART FIRST.,"Yet ever with the gentlest offices,"
5979,PART FIRST.,With tears and prayers the holy exile strove
5980,PART FIRST.,"To wake their better feelings, for he laid                        170"
5981,PART FIRST.,"His hands upon the sick, and they looked up"
5982,PART FIRST.,"With hope and blessed him, and, restored to strength,"
5983,PART FIRST.,"Forgot the vows they made; him, too, who died                     173"
5984,PART FIRST.,"Hardened, and, as to human eyes, in sin,"
5985,PART FIRST.,"He laid in the cold grave, and said a prayer"
5986,PART FIRST.,"For mercy to the God of all, the Judge,"
5987,PART FIRST.,"To whom all hearts be open, and from whom"
5988,PART FIRST.,"No secret thought is hid--and, self-accused,"
5989,PART FIRST.,"Mortal himself, presumed not to condemn."
5990,PART FIRST.,"So passed this ancient holy man his days,                       180"
5991,PART FIRST.,"Peaceful, amid the banished criminals,"
5992,PART FIRST.,"Banished and poor himself, but living thus,"
5993,PART FIRST.,"Among the sternest of their kind, he prayed"
5994,PART FIRST.,For their salvation:--so he passed his days
5995,PART FIRST.,"Peaceful, but sad; and now, with anxious gaze,"
5996,PART FIRST.,"He turned his look to the mysterious man,"
5997,PART FIRST.,"Who, steadfastly beholding him, thus spoke:"
5998,PART FIRST.,The voice of prophecy has been fulfilled;
5999,PART FIRST.,Where is the Temple? where Jerusalem?
6000,PART FIRST.,"Ah! wretched city! Famine, war, and woe                           190"
6001,PART FIRST.,Have done their destined work. The living drops[121]
6002,PART FIRST.,Dead on the carcase he is burying!
6003,PART FIRST.,That famished babe is black! Oh! turn away!
6004,PART FIRST.,All--all is silent now; and thou hast seen
6005,PART FIRST.,"This prophecy fulfilled, for not one stone"
6006,PART FIRST.,Of beautiful and sacred Solima
6007,PART FIRST.,"Is left upon another! He who died,"
6008,PART FIRST.,"When he beheld the city, o'er it wept,"
6009,PART FIRST.,"And said, O daughters of Jerusalem!"
6010,PART FIRST.,"Weep not for me, but for your little ones!                        200"
6011,PART FIRST.,The tender words--dost thou remember them?
6012,PART FIRST.,"Jerusalem, Jerusalem! how oft"
6013,PART FIRST.,"Would I have gathered up those little ones,"
6014,PART FIRST.,Even as a hen beneath a mother's wing;                            204
6015,PART FIRST.,"But ye would not: and now, behold your house"
6016,PART FIRST.,Is left unto you desolate! Alas!
6017,PART FIRST.,How desolate! But even in those last days
6018,PART FIRST.,"Warning was given, if yet they would repent."
6019,PART FIRST.,"A bloody sword, like a red comet, hung"
6020,PART FIRST.,"Above the Temple, and a strange sad light                         210"
6021,PART FIRST.,"Sat on the altar; while the inner gate,"
6022,PART FIRST.,"Untouched, at midnight burst its brazen bars,"
6023,PART FIRST.,And stood wide open; armed men did fight
6024,PART FIRST.,"Amid the clouds; and, in the dead of night,"
6025,PART FIRST.,"The pale priest heard a voice, Depart! depart![122]"
6026,PART FIRST.,So the fair city of Jerusalem
6027,PART FIRST.,"Perished: but, lo! Christ's holy Church shall rise--"
6028,PART FIRST.,"Rise from its ashes--yea, is risen now;"
6029,PART FIRST.,"Its glorious gates shall never be cast down,"
6030,PART FIRST.,"Till He, the King of glory, shall appear!                         220"

6318,JOHN.,"Stirred the dark locks that clustered round his brow,"
6319,JOHN.,"A faint rose mantled on his cheek; his cloak,"

6668,STRANGER.,"Half looking down, half raised to heaven, and shed"
6669,STRANGER.,"Her tears no more: one hand as thus she sat,                      420"
6670,STRANGER.,"With fingers spread, held fast her infant's arm,"
6671,STRANGER.,"O'er its right shoulder, while its arid lips"
6672,STRANGER.,"She drew, in vain, towards her open breast,"
6673,STRANGER.,"Still fearing to look down: her other hand,"
6674,STRANGER.,"Instinctively, she laid on its cold feet,"
6675,STRANGER.,As if to cherish them: the gouts of blood                         426
6676,STRANGER.,"Fell heavy from its matted hair, and stained"
6677,STRANGER.,"Her bosom; but she had composed its hands,"
6678,STRANGER.,"Which now, though cold and dead, each other clasped,"
6679,STRANGER.,"Beneath her neck, as living. So she sat,"
6680,STRANGER.,"Nor sighed, nor moved her face, nor shed a tear"
6681,STRANGER.,"I gently took the infant from her arms,"
6682,STRANGER.,"And buried it beside the sacred brook,"
6683,STRANGER.,"And then, with muttered prayer, she turned and wept--"
6684,STRANGER.,"Wept, as bereaved of all she loved on earth!"
6685,STRANGER.,Fly! and I placed her on the horse with me--
6686,STRANGER.,Leaving behind the sounds and sights of death--
6687,STRANGER.,"The shrieks of massacre, the crash of towers"
6688,STRANGER.,"Falling, the heavy sound of battering-rams:"
6689,STRANGER.,"We passed the victims, blackening in the sun,                     440"
6690,STRANGER.,"And some, yet breathing, on the crucifix.[162]"
6691,STRANGER.,"On, through the valley of Jehoshaphat,"
6692,STRANGER.,I spurred my horse; we passed the sepulchre
6693,STRANGER.,"Of Lazarus, restored from the dark grave,"
6694,STRANGER.,"So those who own the faith of Christ affirm,"
6695,STRANGER.,"With eye-balls ghastly glaring in the light,"
6696,STRANGER.,"At the loud voice of Him who cried, Come forth!"
6697,STRANGER.,"We held our eastern way from Bethany,"
6698,STRANGER.,"Till now we reached the ""Plain of Blood.""[163] I paused"
6699,STRANGER.,"A moment, ere we entered that sad plain.                          450"
6700,STRANGER.,Ah! there are tents upon the southern edge
6701,STRANGER.,Of the horizon! Fly! it is the camp
6702,STRANGER.,"Of Arabs: see! with long and couched spears,"
6703,STRANGER.,A troop is flying o'er the sands! We hear
6704,STRANGER.,Their cries--this way they rush--this way--
6705,STRANGER.,"Fly! fly! and instant, as an arrow speeds,"
6706,STRANGER.,"(My pale companion breathless, and scarce held)"
6707,STRANGER.,"We bounded o'er the desert, till the track                        458"
6708,STRANGER.,Was lost. The voices died away: she sank
6709,STRANGER.,"Faint in my arms, and with her head declined"
6710,STRANGER.,Upon my breastplate. We will rest a while;
6711,STRANGER.,"For she was now so feeble, it behoved"
6712,STRANGER.,"Thus oft to rest, if haply she might feel"
6713,STRANGER.,"Some cool reviving airs breathe on her face,"
6714,STRANGER.,Gently; a few dry dates were all our food.
6715,STRANGER.,"We gazed in silence on the sun, that, red,"
6716,STRANGER.,"Was sinking now beyond the lonely sands,"
6717,STRANGER.,And hurriedly again renewed our flight.
6718,STRANGER.,"The track is lost! Fear not--those are the bones,"
6719,STRANGER.,Not of a murdered traveller. Look out!                            470
6720,STRANGER.,Is that a cloud? or seest thou not the smoke
6721,STRANGER.,Of some lone cottage on the hills? List! list!
6722,STRANGER.,"Is it the tinkle of some rivulet,"
6723,STRANGER.,"Wandering in solitude? On, on, my steed!"
6724,STRANGER.,"We reached the hills, and, looking back, beheld"
6725,STRANGER.,"The western cope of heaven, as night came down,"
6726,STRANGER.,"All fiery red. It was the light, far off,"
6727,STRANGER.,Of the proud Temple flaming! Through the night
6728,STRANGER.,"We held our toiling way, when, at gray dawn,"
6729,STRANGER.,"We saw, beneath us, palms, and city walls,                        480"
6730,STRANGER.,"And Jordan, slowly flowing to the south."
6731,STRANGER.,Yes! these are palms and walls of Jericho;
6732,STRANGER.,But all was silent and forsaken. War
6733,STRANGER.,"Had blown his trump; and Pity, at the blast,"
6734,STRANGER.,"Had knelt in tears, and hid her face to hear"
6735,STRANGER.,"That deep, dire groan; but it is heard no more,"
6736,STRANGER.,"For Silence, Solitude, and Ruin sit,"
6737,STRANGER.,"Mocking each other, at the city gates."
6738,STRANGER.,Here were no murmurs of tumultuous life.
6739,STRANGER.,"We joined a mourning train, that held their way,                  490"
6740,STRANGER.,"Women, and children, and white-headed men,"
6741,STRANGER.,"Forlorn, by Jordan's banks, to Galilee,                           492"
6742,STRANGER.,Seeking the city of Tiberias.
6743,STRANGER.,"With many tears, my poor companion told"
6744,STRANGER.,Her tale: a daughter of Jerusalem
6745,STRANGER.,"Implored their pity; and the daggers, raised"
6746,STRANGER.,"To pierce a Roman soldier to the heart,"
6747,STRANGER.,"Were in the act arrested, for her sake--"
6748,STRANGER.,"Trifosa, of the tribe of Benjamin,"
6749,STRANGER.,Who owed her life and safety to his sword.                        500
6750,STRANGER.,"We reached the city: here she had a friend,"
6751,STRANGER.,"Widowed like her, who wept to hear her tale."
6752,STRANGER.,"Here, wedded, and by Israel's laws made one,"
6753,STRANGER.,I lived--a fisher toiling with his net
6754,STRANGER.,To gain our daily bread; but soon my heart
6755,STRANGER.,"Beat for a wider scene--for enterprise,"
6756,STRANGER.,The soul of a young soldier; and with thoughts
6757,STRANGER.,"Stirring and restless, after twelve long months,"
6758,STRANGER.,"We came, by Tabor, to the western sea."
6759,STRANGER.,I had a robber's cavern at the foot                               510
6760,STRANGER.,"Of Carmel, and oft skirred the neighbouring plains"
6761,STRANGER.,"On my fleet battle-horse, with spurs of blood."
6762,STRANGER.,"Here I was joined by soldiers, desperate"
6763,STRANGER.,And outcast as myself; we were a band
6764,STRANGER.,Of secret and of fearful brotherhood
6765,STRANGER.,"That tenanted these caverns. But my wife,"
6766,STRANGER.,"When we were absent, and the cave was still,"
6767,STRANGER.,"Wept, for the love of those who were no more;"
6768,STRANGER.,"Trembled, and wept for me. When I returned,"
6769,STRANGER.,"Weary, at night, she sat and sang to me;                          520"
6770,STRANGER.,"And sometimes, when she was alone whole days,"
6771,STRANGER.,"She wandered o'er the mountains, gathering flowers,"
6772,STRANGER.,"Hyacinths, lilies, and anemones;[164]"
6773,STRANGER.,"And when my hands were bloody, gave me them,"
6774,STRANGER.,"With trembling hand, and sadness in her look.                     525"
6775,STRANGER.,"Why should I think, or sigh, or feel remorse!"
6776,STRANGER.,Was I not leader of the bravest band
6777,STRANGER.,That ever shook their flashing scymitars
6778,STRANGER.,"Against the morning sun! But, oh! that look!"
6779,STRANGER.,"How has it thrilled, even to my inmost heart:                     530"
6780,STRANGER.,"One child, the pledge of warm affection, died,"
6781,STRANGER.,And now she roved in morning dew no more;
6782,STRANGER.,"And oft, when I returned with gore-stained brow,"
6783,STRANGER.,"I saw a strange, sad wandering in her eyes."
6784,STRANGER.,Alas! her gentle mind was gone! She sang--
6785,STRANGER.,She gazed upon my face--she smiled--she died--
6786,STRANGER.,"And her last words were, O Jerusalem,"
6787,STRANGER.,"Jerusalem! I buried her in peace,"
6788,STRANGER.,"Without a name, among the mountain flowers."
6789,STRANGER.,And now my heart was hardened as a rock                           540
6790,STRANGER.,Against the world. I heard no soothing voice;
6791,STRANGER.,I never looked upon a human face
6792,STRANGER.,With tenderness again; a darker shade
6793,STRANGER.,"Of passions gathered on my lonely heart,"
6794,STRANGER.,"Till love, and charity, and pity died."
6795,STRANGER.,I may not say what I have seen and done:
6796,STRANGER.,Here I have lived a fettered slave seven years;
6797,STRANGER.,Here thy mild voice has called back to my heart
6798,STRANGER.,"Sad recollections. Father,--and he knelt"
6799,STRANGER.,"And kissed his withered hand, and cried again,                    550"
6800,STRANGER.,"Oh! father, pray for me!"
6801,STRANGER.,The stranger stood
6802,STRANGER.,"Unmoved, but tears were on the old man's cheek."
6803,STRANGER.,
6804,STRANGER.,
6805,PART THIRD.,PART THIRD.
6806,PART THIRD.,
6807,PART THIRD.,"The sounds of an approaching storm--Vision, _etc._"
6808,PART THIRD.,
6809,PART THIRD.,The east is overcast; the nearer isles
6810,PART THIRD.,Are hidden by a sudden spleen; the clouds
6811,PART THIRD.,Upon Elijah's promontory[165] now
6812,PART THIRD.,Are mustering gloomily; there is a sound
6813,PART THIRD.,"Of rain, and as, with interrupted gusts,"
6814,PART THIRD.,"The winds are rising, a long murmur comes,"
6815,PART THIRD.,"More hollow, from the seas; at times a wail,"
6816,PART THIRD.,"At distance, seems to mingle with the wind,"
6817,PART THIRD.,Audibly; even the sea-birds on the cliffs
6818,PART THIRD.,"Cower, while the sounds as of a trump are heard,                   10"
6819,PART THIRD.,"Prophetical and sad. Let us retire,"
6820,PART THIRD.,For Sagittarius rules the wayward year.[166]
6821,PART THIRD.,"Pensive, they both retired into the cave."
6822,PART THIRD.,"The eyes of John were heavy, and ere long"
6823,PART THIRD.,"He sank into deep slumber, like a child,"
6824,PART THIRD.,Hushed by the ocean sounds; and now arose
6825,PART THIRD.,Visions more dark and terrible. He saw
6826,PART THIRD.,The Lamb of God open the book. Hark! hark!
6827,PART THIRD.,The thunder and the tempest roll! John saw
6828,PART THIRD.,"Four cherubims, and they said, Come and see!                       20"
6829,PART THIRD.,"He looked, and, behold! on a white horse"
6830,PART THIRD.,"Sat one who had a bow, and he there was crowned;"
6831,PART THIRD.,"And with his bow, and crowned, he went forth,"
6832,PART THIRD.,"""Conquering and to conquer."""
6833,PART THIRD.,Hark! a moan
6834,PART THIRD.,Comes up from all the earth! The second seal
6835,PART THIRD.,"Is opened, and the second cherubim                                 27"
6836,PART THIRD.,"Cries, Come and see! Behold another horse,"
6837,PART THIRD.,And it is red;[167] and he who sits thereon
6838,PART THIRD.,"Is like a warrior, waving in his hand"
6839,PART THIRD.,The sword of slaughter; so he goeth forth
6840,PART THIRD.,"To kill and to destroy, and ""to take peace"
6841,PART THIRD.,"From all the earth."" Listen! for the third seal"
6842,PART THIRD.,"Is opening now, and the third cherubim"
6843,PART THIRD.,"Cries, Come and see! Then said a voice to John,"
6844,PART THIRD.,What dost thou see?
6845,PART THIRD.,
6846,JOHN.,JOHN.
6847,JOHN.,
6848,JOHN.,Lo! a black horse appears--
6849,JOHN.,Its rider has a balance in his hand.
6850,JOHN.,Ride on--ride on! Justice and Equity
6851,JOHN.,"Visit the earth, with Plenty.[168]                                 40"
6852,JOHN.,The fourth seal
6853,JOHN.,"Is opened now, and the fourth cherubim"
6854,JOHN.,"Cries, Come and see!"
6855,JOHN.,
6856,VOICE.,VOICE.
6857,VOICE.,
6858,VOICE.,What seest thou?
6859,VOICE.,
6860,JOHN.,JOHN.
6861,JOHN.,
6862,JOHN.,A pale horse--
6863,JOHN.,
6864,VOICE.,VOICE.
6865,VOICE.,
6866,VOICE.,And rider?
6867,VOICE.,
6868,JOHN.,JOHN.
6869,JOHN.,
6870,JOHN.,Yes--a dire anatomy.
6871,JOHN.,"As he rides on, nations with terror shriek--"
6872,JOHN.,DEATH! and the gulf of hell shoots out its flame
6873,JOHN.,After the footfall of that ghastly horse.                          50
6874,JOHN.,"The rider shouts, and haggard Famine crawls,"
6875,JOHN.,"With wan and wasted visage, from her cave;"
6876,JOHN.,"And Pestilence, speeding unseen in air,"
6877,JOHN.,"Breathes, and ten thousand perish, and wild beasts"
6878,JOHN.,"Howl in the city of the dead, and feed"
6879,JOHN.,Upon the black and countless carcases.[169]
6880,JOHN.,"Low thunders rolled, and sounds of woe were heard,"
6881,JOHN.,When the fifth seal was opened; and John saw
6882,JOHN.,"A burning altar, and beneath it, souls"
6883,JOHN.,"Of those who had been slain--the witnesses,                        60"
6884,JOHN.,"Confessing Christ in torments, and they cried,"
6885,JOHN.,"How long, O Lord, holy, and just, and true,"
6886,JOHN.,Dost thou not judge--judge and avenge our cause!
6887,JOHN.,"And robes of white were given to each of them,"
6888,JOHN.,"And a voice said, Oh! rest ye yet a while,"
6889,JOHN.,Rest ye till persecution's cup be drained;
6890,JOHN.,The judgment leave to Him who sits in heaven.
6891,JOHN.,"The thunders louder rolled, as the sixth seal"
6892,JOHN.,Was opened. Ah! the sun is black above
6893,JOHN.,"As sackcloth, and the round moon red as blood;                     70"
6894,JOHN.,"Earth rocks from east to west; the stars are fallen,"
6895,JOHN.,"And falling, as the fig-tree casts its figs,"
6896,JOHN.,When shaken by the mighty hurricane.
6897,JOHN.,"Heaven is departing, like a scroll; the kings,"
6898,JOHN.,"And the chief captains, and the mighty men,"
6899,JOHN.,"Bondmen and free, have hid them in the caves,"
6900,JOHN.,"And mountains, and dark places of the earth,"
6901,JOHN.,"And to the mountains and the rocks they cry,"
6902,JOHN.,Fall on us! hide us--hide us from the face
6903,JOHN.,"Of the incensed Lamb, for his great day                            80"
6904,JOHN.,"Of wrath is come, and who on earth may stand![170]"
6905,JOHN.,"And after this, John saw four angels stand                       82"
6906,JOHN.,On the four corners of the earth; they held
6907,JOHN.,"The rushing winds, that not a wind should blow"
6908,JOHN.,"Tumultuous on the earth, or on the sea,"
6909,JOHN.,"Whilst they stood silent; then with radiant wings,"
6910,JOHN.,"Bright as the sun ascending from the east,"
6911,JOHN.,"Another glorious angel came, who bore"
6912,JOHN.,"Thy seal, O living God; and a loud voice"
6913,JOHN.,"To the four angels cried, Hurt not the earth                       90"
6914,JOHN.,"Or seas, till on their foreheads we have sealed"
6915,JOHN.,The servants of our God. And they were sealed
6916,JOHN.,"Of all the tribes of Israel. After this,"
6917,JOHN.,A multitude which no man on the earth
6918,JOHN.,"Could number, of all nations and all tongues,"
6919,JOHN.,"Clothed in white robes, and bearing in their hands"
6920,JOHN.,"Palms, as triumphant, stood before the throne"
6921,JOHN.,"Of glory, and before the Lamb of God,"
6922,JOHN.,"And cried aloud, Salvation to our God,"
6923,JOHN.,"Which sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb.[171]                100"
6924,JOHN.,"And all the angels stood about the throne,"
6925,JOHN.,"The elders, and the mighty cherubims,"
6926,JOHN.,"And on their faces fell, before the throne,"
6927,JOHN.,"And worshipped God, and cried aloud, Amen:"
6928,JOHN.,"Blessing and glory, wisdom, honour, power,"
6929,JOHN.,"Be to our God, for ever and for ever!"
6930,JOHN.,Then seemed that one among the elders spake
6931,JOHN.,"To John, and said, What are these multitudes"
6932,JOHN.,"Who bear triumphant palms, all clothed in white?"
6933,JOHN.,"John answered, Sir, thou knowest. He replied,                     110"
6934,JOHN.,"These are victorious saints, who have come out"
6935,JOHN.,"From the great tribulation, and have washed"
6936,JOHN.,"Their bloody garments, and have made them white--"
6937,JOHN.,White through His blood who died upon the cross;
6938,JOHN.,"Therefore they stand before the throne of God,                    115"
6939,JOHN.,"And in his temple serve him day and night,"
6940,JOHN.,And He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
6941,JOHN.,"Among them. They shall hunger now no more,"
6942,JOHN.,"Nor thirst; the sun shall cheer them, but not burn;"
6943,JOHN.,"The Lamb shall feed them, and shall lead them forth               120"
6944,JOHN.,"To pleasant pastures, and to fountains bright,"
6945,JOHN.,And from their eyelids wipe away all tears
6946,JOHN.,For ever.
6947,JOHN.,"There was silence in the heavens,"
6948,JOHN.,"When the seventh seal was opened, and John saw"
6949,JOHN.,"Seven angels standing by the throne of God,"
6950,JOHN.,"Having seven trumpets; and an angel came,"
6951,JOHN.,"Who, hovering, with a golden censer, stood"
6952,JOHN.,"Before an altar, and the smoke went up,"
6953,JOHN.,"Of incense, from the altar. These are prayers                     130"
6954,JOHN.,"Of all the saints on earth--prayers which ascend,"
6955,JOHN.,"Like incense, from the censer in the hand"
6956,JOHN.,"Of that bright angel, to the throne of God."
6957,JOHN.,Ah! he has cast his censer to the earth;
6958,JOHN.,And suddenly the earthquake and the storm
6959,JOHN.,"Awoke, and through the darkness, rolled and flashed"
6960,JOHN.,"Deep thunders and the lightning; and, behold!"
6961,JOHN.,"The seven angels lift their trumpets high,"
6962,JOHN.,"Lift, and prepare to sound. And now the first"
6963,JOHN.,"Sounds--and there follows instant hail, and fire                  140"
6964,JOHN.,"Mingled with blood, which on the earth was cast;"
6965,JOHN.,"So that the trees stood bare and desolate,"
6966,JOHN.,And the green grass was withered and burnt up.
6967,JOHN.,"The second angel sounded, and, behold!"
6968,JOHN.,A burning mountain cast into the sea.
6969,JOHN.,The third part of all creatures in the sea
6970,JOHN.,"Died, a third part of all the ships that sailed"
6971,JOHN.,Upon the sea was smitten and destroyed.
6972,JOHN.,And the third angel sounded; and there fell                     149
6973,JOHN.,A star from heaven. It fell on the third part
6974,JOHN.,"Of rivers, and the fountains of the deep;"
6975,JOHN.,"And swollen and livid carcases were left,"
6976,JOHN.,"Weltering, beside the dark, blood-heaving sea."
6977,JOHN.,And the fourth angel sounded; and the sun
6978,JOHN.,"For the third part was smitten, and the moon"
6979,JOHN.,For the third part was darkened; and John saw
6980,JOHN.,"And heard an angel flying in mid heaven,"
6981,JOHN.,"And crying with a mighty voice, Woe, woe,"
6982,JOHN.,"Woe to the earth, by reason of the voice"
6983,JOHN.,Of the three trumpets that are yet to sound!                      160
6984,JOHN.,And the fifth trumpet sounded; and John saw
6985,JOHN.,A star fall from the heavens to the earth;
6986,JOHN.,And to the angel of the star was given
6987,JOHN.,The key that shuts the nethermost abyss
6988,JOHN.,Upon the groans of those that groan therein.
6989,JOHN.,"The pit is opened, and the volumed smoke,"
6990,JOHN.,"Shooting red flames, as from a furnace, rolls,"
6991,JOHN.,"And out of it there issued crawling things,[172]"
6992,JOHN.,Like scorpions; but they had no power to hurt
6993,JOHN.,"The green grass of the earth, but those alone                     170"
6994,JOHN.,Who on their foreheads had no seal of heaven:
6995,JOHN.,"These shall seek death, but find him not, for death"
6996,JOHN.,"Shall fly from them, when they most pray to die."
6997,JOHN.,"Like horses trained for battle, a dire troop"
6998,JOHN.,"Comes sounding; on their heads are crowns, like gold;"
6999,JOHN.,"Faces are theirs, like men; and they have hair"
7000,JOHN.,"As women, and teeth white and terrible"
7001,JOHN.,"As lions; and their iron breastplates shake,"
7002,JOHN.,With hurtling noise; the sounding of their wings
7003,JOHN.,"Is as the chariots and the steeds of war,                         180"
7004,JOHN.,Rushing to the thick war. Who is their king?                      181
7005,JOHN.,"Apollyon, angel of the deep abyss."
7006,JOHN.,"One woe is past, yet two more woes remain;"
7007,JOHN.,"For the sixth angel sounded, and John heard"
7008,JOHN.,"A voice like thunders: The four angels loose,"
7009,JOHN.,In the great river of Euphrates bound.
7010,JOHN.,"And the four giant angels are unbound,"
7011,JOHN.,And they go forth to slaughter. And John saw
7012,JOHN.,"The horses in the vision, and he saw"
7013,JOHN.,"Those who sat on them, with breastplates of fire,                 190"
7014,JOHN.,"Of jacinth, and of sulphur; and the heads"
7015,JOHN.,"Of the gaunt horses were as lions' heads,"
7016,JOHN.,And from their mouths issued red fire and smoke.
7017,JOHN.,"But men repented not, nor turned away"
7018,JOHN.,"From their dark idols, or their sorceries,"
7019,JOHN.,"From worshipping their gods of gold, or stone,"
7020,JOHN.,"Or brass, or silver! Hush! the sound of wings!"
7021,JOHN.,"Another mighty angel comes from heaven,"
7022,JOHN.,"And lights on earth, clothed in a radiant cloud."
7023,JOHN.,There is a rainbow on his head; his face                          200
7024,JOHN.,Is as the orient sun; his feet appear
7025,JOHN.,Pillars of fire; in his right hand a book.
7026,JOHN.,"He sets his right foot on the seas, his left"
7027,JOHN.,"Upon the earth, and cries, with a loud voice,"
7028,JOHN.,"Till the world shrinks: and when he thus has cried,"
7029,JOHN.,"Seven thunders answer, uttering to heaven"
7030,JOHN.,Their voices.
7031,JOHN.,"Then the angel said to John,"
7032,JOHN.,Art thou about to write? Seal up the things
7033,JOHN.,Which the seven thunders uttered: write them not.                 210
7034,JOHN.,"The angel which John saw stand on the seas,"
7035,JOHN.,"And on the earth, raised his right hand to heaven,"
7036,JOHN.,"And swore by Him which liveth, who shall live"
7037,JOHN.,For ever and for ever--swore by Him
7038,JOHN.,"Who made the heaven, the earth, and all therein,                  215"
7039,JOHN.,That time shall be no more: the mystery
7040,JOHN.,Of God shall be concluded in the days
7041,JOHN.,Of this last angel's voice. That awful voice
7042,JOHN.,"John heard entranced; and the voice said to him,"
7043,JOHN.,"Take from the angel's hand,--the hand of him                      220"
7044,JOHN.,"Who standeth on the seas and on the earth,--"
7045,JOHN.,That book thou markest open in his hand.
7046,JOHN.,"That book, the rapt Apostle cried, that book!"
7047,JOHN.,"The angel mildly answered, Let thy heart"
7048,JOHN.,"Feed on it; sweet and bitter it shall be,"
7049,JOHN.,"And thou shalt prophesy of things to come,"
7050,JOHN.,Of dark things yet to be upon the earth.
7051,JOHN.,"The seventh angel lifted high his trump,"
7052,JOHN.,And sounded; when from heaven a voice was heard--
7053,JOHN.,The kingdoms of this world they are become                        230
7054,JOHN.,The kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ:
7055,JOHN.,"For ever and for ever, he shall reign,"
7056,JOHN.,For ever and for ever.
7057,JOHN.,Now the ark
7058,JOHN.,Of God appeared; and round about the ark
7059,JOHN.,"There was a rainbow stealing through the rain,"
7060,JOHN.,"The ark of the new covenant: and, lo!"
7061,JOHN.,A shining company stood with the Lamb
7062,JOHN.,"Upon Mount Zion, and a song was heard"
7063,JOHN.,"Of harpers, harping a new song--the song                          240"
7064,JOHN.,Of life and immortality. And John
7065,JOHN.,"Then heard a voice--a voice from heaven, which said,"
7066,JOHN.,"Write, write, From henceforth blessed are the dead"
7067,JOHN.,"Which in the Lord shall die, for they shall rest"
7068,JOHN.,From all their labours! Blessed are the dead!
7069,JOHN.,The shadows are departed; horse and trump
7070,JOHN.,Are seen and heard no more; the trumpet's clang
7071,JOHN.,"Dies far away: the Apostle turned and prayed,"
7072,JOHN.,"With eyes upraised; and now, for pealing trumps,                  249"
7073,JOHN.,"Heard in the wind the lessening sound of harps,"
7074,JOHN.,"Still lessening, and still lessening, till the cave"
7075,JOHN.,Was silent; and the stirring winds without
7076,JOHN.,"Alone were heard, like sweet, sad melodies,"
7077,JOHN.,Remembered in old times; whilst he who stood
7078,JOHN.,"Beside him watched; and after, as the day"
7079,JOHN.,"Slowly declined, they two conversing sat,"
7080,JOHN.,Conversing of God's judgment--of the voice
7081,JOHN.,"Which said to man the sinner, Dust thou art,"
7082,JOHN.,"And unto dust thou shalt return--of death,"
7083,JOHN.,And immortality through Christ restored;                          260
7084,JOHN.,"So they deceived the time, till John, oppressed"
7085,JOHN.,"With sights and sounds so terrible, lay down,"
7086,JOHN.,"And sank to sleep, not to awake till dawn."

7094,PART FOURTH.,"John woke from slumber, when the early trump"
7095,PART FOURTH.,"Rang from the Roman camp below, at break"
7096,PART FOURTH.,"Of the gray dawn; and when the sun arose,"
7097,PART FOURTH.,"After his orisons to Heaven, he sat"
7098,PART FOURTH.,"On the rude stone before his cave, and marked"
7099,PART FOURTH.,"His staff and form shadowed against the rock,"
7100,PART FOURTH.,"Watching the fitful gleams that, here and there,"
7101,PART FOURTH.,"Chequered the pale Ægean, far away;"
7102,PART FOURTH.,"While he, who never left his side, appeared"

7104,PART FOURTH.,"Shone on his waving tresses, when he raised                        11"
7105,PART FOURTH.,"His look to heaven, and stood sublime in light."

7110,PART FOURTH.,"And hail to thee,"

7113,PART FOURTH.,
7114,ROMAN COMMANDER.,ROMAN COMMANDER.
7115,ROMAN COMMANDER.,
7116,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The world's great sun is set--Cæsar is dead!                       20

7119,JOHN.,
7120,JOHN.,Cæsar! Ah! in my dream did I not see

7122,JOHN.,Dropping with blood!
7123,JOHN.,
7124,ROMAN COMMANDER.,ROMAN COMMANDER.
7125,ROMAN COMMANDER.,
7126,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Why, was he not a god?--"
7127,ROMAN COMMANDER.,So he proclaimed himself--a god on earth!
7128,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Giving command that altars to his name
7129,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Should blaze, as to great Jupiter! Old man,"
7130,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Art thou not prisoner for gainsaying this?[174]
7131,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"But, father, if a soldier might pronounce,"
7132,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With all respect to thy gray hairs, I deem                         30"
7133,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The sole, imperial master of the world"
7134,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Might worthier claim that title, than a man"
7135,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Mocked, scourged--ay, scourged!--and crucified with thieves!"
7136,ROMAN COMMANDER.,
7137,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Rose and ascended into heaven! replied
7138,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The meek old man--a hectic on his cheek--
7139,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Rose, and ascended into heaven, to sit                             36"
7140,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"At the right hand of God, from thence to come,"
7141,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Judge of the quick and dead! Proud soldier, hear--"
7142,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Hear how a prisoner for Jesus Christ
7143,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Can answer thee!
7144,ROMAN COMMANDER.,When King Agrippa sat
7145,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Upon his throne, in oriental state,"
7146,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Surrounded by the Roman soldiery,"
7147,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With axe and fasces of imperial sway,"
7148,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Fair Berenice seated on his right,"
7149,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And on his left Festus the governor,"
7150,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Paul, a poor prisoner of Jesus Christ,"
7151,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Before him stood, in chains; and as he spoke"
7152,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of ""resurrection,"" and the world to come,"
7153,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"He cried, King of the Jews, dost thou believe                      50"
7154,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The prophets! Yes! I know thou dost believe.
7155,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The king, with faltering voice, tremblingly cried,"
7156,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Paul, Paul, thou dost persuade even me, almost--"
7157,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"To be a Christian! Paul, with lifted hand"
7158,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And steadfast look, thus answered him, Almost!"
7159,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Oh! would that the whole world were not ""almost,"""
7160,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"But ""altogether"" such as I am now,"
7161,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Except these bonds.
7162,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Soldier, I say the same."
7163,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"But hie thee to thy eagle; I am here,                              60"
7164,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"A poor old man, like Paul, a prisoner,"
7165,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And thou, an officer of mighty Rome;"
7166,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Yet would I pray to God, that thou may'st be,"
7167,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Oh! not ""almost,"" but ""altogether,"" such"
7168,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"As I am now, except these few gray hairs,"
7169,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Old age, and many sorrows; yet even here"
7170,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"My soul hath been sustained by Him who said,"
7171,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Lo! I am with you alway, and I know"
7172,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"He still is with me. I have heard his voice,"
7173,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And seen his look of glory and of love                             70
7174,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Turned on me, in this solitude; and he--"
7175,ROMAN COMMANDER.,He who did shudder with me at the voice
7176,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of thy bold blasphemy, here lately came"
7177,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With words of comfort, and these aged eyes"
7178,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Have seen the things that must hereafter be;
7179,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Yet know, stern soldier, if my days were passed"
7180,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Lonely as hopeless, I would not exchange"
7181,ROMAN COMMANDER.,These few gray hairs for thy green laurel crown--
7182,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"This solitude, for living Cæsar's throne,"
7183,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Or Cæsar's subject world!                                          80
7184,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The soldier turned
7185,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Disdainful, and his crest shook in the wind;"
7186,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Then, lifting high his ensign of command,"
7187,ROMAN COMMANDER.,He bade the trumpet sound the second watch.
7188,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"John knelt, and prayed, Thy kingdom come, O Lord!"
7189,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Then he who stood beside him, spoke unmoved:"
7190,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Rome--Rome shall be no more! At dead of night,"
7191,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Hark! the barbarian trump; Jerusalem
7192,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Shall be avenged; and those of distant days,"
7193,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Pondering the fate of empires, there shall come                    90"
7194,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"To muse upon the fragments of her might,"
7195,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Her ancient glory passed as morning clouds,"
7196,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And tremble for the judgments of the Lord
7197,ROMAN COMMANDER.,In all the world!
7198,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Now to the cave retire,"
7199,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"For other visions of the things to come,"
7200,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And other fearful shadows, must thou see."
7201,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"John sat, and held his hands upon his brow:"
7202,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The earth seems to retire, and all the sounds"
7203,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Of tumult and of woe at once to cease.                            100
7204,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Then John was in the Spirit, and he saw"
7205,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Seven angels, and, beneath, a sea of glass"
7206,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Mingled with fire; and on the sea of glass
7207,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Those who had gained, on earth, the victory                       104"
7208,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Over the beast, all standing on the sea"
7209,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of glass, and in their hands the harps of God,"
7210,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And thus they sung, Oh! great and marvellous"
7211,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Art thou, Almighty God, and just and true"
7212,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Are all thy ways, thou King of saints! Amen."
7213,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Now from the temple a loud voice was heard,                     110"
7214,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Which said to the seven angels, Go your ways,"
7215,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Pour out the vials of the wrath of God
7216,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Upon the earth.[175] Then on the men which bore
7217,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The mark upon their foreheads of the beast,"
7218,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Or fell down to his image, noisome sores"
7219,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And plague-spots fell.
7220,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The second angel poured
7221,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"His vial on the sea, and it became"
7222,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The blood of a dead man; and every thing
7223,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Which had the breath of life died in the sea.                     120
7224,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And the third angel poured his vial out
7225,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Upon the rivers, and fresh fountains clear,"
7226,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And they became red blood. And then John heard,"
7227,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"In trance, the angels of the waters say,"
7228,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Righteous art thou, O Lord! and righteously,"
7229,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"O thou which art, and was, and which shall be,"
7230,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Thus hast thou judged, for they have shed the blood"
7231,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of prophets and of saints! A voice replied,"
7232,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"From out the altar, Even so, O Lord!"
7233,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Almighty God, thy judgments are most true!                        130"
7234,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And the fourth angel poured his vial out
7235,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Upon the sun, and power was given to him"
7236,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"To scorch men with the fire, and they blasphemed"
7237,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The name of God, and still repented not,"
7238,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Looking with gnashing teeth upon the sun.
7239,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And the fifth angel poured his vial out
7240,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Upon the kingdom of the beast, and, lo!                           137"
7241,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The kingdom of the beast at once was dark:
7242,ROMAN COMMANDER.,But men repented not--even while they gnawed
7243,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Their tongues for pain, blaspheming God in heaven."
7244,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And the sixth angel poured his vial out
7245,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Where the great river of Euphrates rolls,"
7246,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And it was quick dried up, and so became"
7247,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"A highway for the armies of the east,"
7248,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And for the kings of earth, and the whole world,"
7249,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Gathering to battle, on the dreadful day"
7250,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of the incensed Lord, into a place"
7251,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Called ""Armageddon,"" in the Hebrew tongue."
7252,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And the seventh angel poured his vial out
7253,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Into the air, and a loud voice was heard                          150"
7254,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Out of the temple's inmost shrine, which cried,"
7255,ROMAN COMMANDER.,All is fulfilled! At once an earthquake shook
7256,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The ground, and lightnings, red and terrible,"
7257,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Flashed, and the thunders rolled along the sky,"
7258,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And strange and fearful voices in the air
7259,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Were heard, so dreadful was that storm. Aghast,"
7260,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The nations fell; and the great Babylon
7261,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Came in remembrance before God, to pour"
7262,ROMAN COMMANDER.,On her the fierceness of his wakened wrath.
7263,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And now John saw another angel fly                              160
7264,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"In clouds, and coming down with power from heaven"
7265,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Unto the earth; and all the earth beneath
7266,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Was lighted with his glory; and he cried,"
7267,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With the loud voice of judgment, Babylon"
7268,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The great is fallen! And then another voice
7269,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Answered, Come out of her! Hath she not said,"
7270,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"I sit a queen, mighty as Ashtoreth?"
7271,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The kings of earth shall tremble when they see
7272,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The smoke of her great torment; they shall stand
7273,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Afar off from her burning, and shall cry,                         170"
7274,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"That mighty city, Babylon, alas!                                  171"
7275,ROMAN COMMANDER.,In one hour is her judgment come! The voice
7276,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Of harpers and of trumpeters no more
7277,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Shall in her streets be heard: the blood of saints,"
7278,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of prophets, and of martyrs, is avenged!"
7279,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The cries are heard, the smoke is seen, no more."
7280,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And after this, John lifted up his eyes,"
7281,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And heard the voice of mighty companies,"
7282,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Which sang and shouted, Alleluia! reign"
7283,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"For ever, Lord of lords and King of kings!                        180"
7284,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Salvation, honour, glory, power, and praise,"
7285,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Be unto thee, O Lord! for thou hast judged"
7286,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With righteousness! They, with acclaiming voice,"
7287,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Still sang and shouted, Alleluia--reign"
7288,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"For ever, Lord of lords and King of kings!"
7289,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Heard through the empyrean, the great voice"
7290,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Again went up, whilst all the courts of heaven"
7291,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Rang, Alleluia! glory be to thee,"
7292,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Glory and power, Lord God Omnipotent![176]"
7293,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Then the heaven opened, and, behold! a horse                    190"
7294,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"As white as snow, and he who sat thereon"
7295,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Was called ""True and Faithful;"" on his head"
7296,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Were crowns on crowns, and underneath a name"
7297,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Which no man knew, save he who bore that name."
7298,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"His vesture was a robe of blood, and they"
7299,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Who followed him proclaimed, The Word of God!"
7300,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And all the heavenly armies followed him
7301,ROMAN COMMANDER.,On horses white like his; and on his robe
7302,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Was written--King of kings and Lord of lords.
7303,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The pomp is passed, and now John raised his eyes,"
7304,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And saw an angel standing in the sun.                             201
7305,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The angel in his watch looked down to earth,"
7306,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And all the armies of the earth came forth
7307,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"To war with the bright chivalry of heaven,                        204"
7308,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And Him who sat on the white horse! And, lo!"
7309,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Before the mighty cherubims advanced
7310,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Michael, the great archangel, while a shout"
7311,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Rang, that the sun in heaven might seem to stand"
7312,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Still at a sound so terrible. Opposed
7313,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"To the great armies of the living God,                            210"
7314,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Frown the Satanic host, far as the eye"
7315,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Can reach; and horses black as night,"
7316,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And spectre armies, led, in front, by Death,"
7317,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Appear, receding into farther depths"
7318,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of blackness; while, anon, a dragon, scaled,"
7319,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Moves weltering onward. Michael, from the ranks"
7320,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of cherubim advancing, lifts on high"
7321,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"His mace, and full on the scaled dragon's crest"
7322,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Smites. At his feet the dragon lay, and, lo!"
7323,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The sable phantom-horsemen at the sight                           220
7324,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Are vanished. Raise the victor-song to Him
7325,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Who rides on the white horse, and to his God"
7326,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"In heaven, for the great dragon is cast down"
7327,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Into the bottomless and burning lake!
7328,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Another angel, with white waving plume,"
7329,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Descends; an iron chain is in his hand,"
7330,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And the dark key of destiny, which shuts"
7331,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The bottomless abyss, from whence the smoke"
7332,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Ascends--ascends, but not a groan is heard."
7333,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The ancient dragon is cast down, and bound--                      230"
7334,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Bound for a thousand years, in chains, and thrown,"
7335,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Howling, into that nethermost abyss;"
7336,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"While mercy, equity, and peace, and truth,"
7337,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Like angel forms, visit the earth, and move,"
7338,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Radiant as light, among the sons of men,"
7339,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And only sounds are heard of harmonies,"
7340,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Such as in heaven are sung about the throne,"
7341,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"O'er which, in dewy light, the rainbow bends.                     238"
7342,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The trump of bannered war, the sighs and groans"

7344,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"In one deep murmur, to high heaven, are ceased;"
7345,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"For love and mercy walk among mankind,"
7346,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And so shall walk, till the last trump shall sound."
7347,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Now a new heaven and new earth appear;
7348,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And, coming down from heaven, even as a bride"
7349,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Adorned to meet her husband, John beheld"
7350,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The City of the New Jerusalem,"
7351,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Glittering beyond the clouds; and then he heard
7352,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"A voice from a bright cloud, The Lord shall come"
7353,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And dwell with men, and he shall be their God;                    250"
7354,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And God shall wipe from every eye the tear,"
7355,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And death shall be no more!
7356,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"John spread his hands,"
7357,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And cried, with eyes upraised to heaven, Oh! stay,"
7358,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Visions of bliss! I am bowed down with age,"
7359,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Forlorn on earth, and I have tarried long"
7360,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Alone and sad. Oh! come, Lord Jesus Christ!"
7361,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"A voice replied, Thou shalt be where he is!"
7362,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Hark! 'twas the billow beating on the rocks
7363,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of melancholy Patmos, and John wept,                              260"
7364,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"As, slowly fading, like a summer dream,"
7365,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"He saw the towers, and gates, and palaces,"
7366,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Of New Jerusalem fade in the clouds
7367,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of eve, which shot its gleaming pinnacles"
7368,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Aloft in the pale sky, and flushed the track"
7369,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Of the sun's westering orb with crimson light.
7370,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"As the sun sunk, the sound of trump and horn"
7371,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Shrilled, and the old man, starting from his trance,"
7372,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Beheld below the cave the Roman troop,"
7373,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Stationed to guard the island criminals,                          270"
7374,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Wind slow, in martial file, with banners spread,                  271"
7375,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Returning to their tents.
7376,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Ah! where are now
7377,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The temples of the New Jerusalem,"
7378,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Glittering amid the clouds of parting day?
7379,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Gone, like the rack; and Patmos' dreary isle"
7380,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And melancholy caves return the sound
7381,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of marching men, and the hoarse Roman trump."
7382,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The Apostle to the entrance of his cave,"
7383,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The last remaining light on his gray hairs,                       280"
7384,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Comes slowly forth, and rests upon his staff,"
7385,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"When the rock-pigeon, at the trump disturbed,"
7386,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Flew to his withered hand. With plumed crest
7387,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Upon his brazen helmet, holding high"
7388,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The ensign of command, an eagle borne"
7389,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Before him, on a spear, the præfect leads"
7390,ROMAN COMMANDER.,His legionary band; and as aloft
7391,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The banners wave, and shields and corslets throw"
7392,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Back a pale glimmer, mark a mournful train"
7393,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of fettered men move sullenly, with whom,                         290"
7394,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Thoughtful, and with his hands upon his breast,"
7395,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"His eyes, at times, uplifted to the heavens,"
7396,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"One, as a soldier worn with toil, but marked"
7397,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With a stern sadness on his manly brow,"
7398,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Comes silently, a tear on his dark cheek."
7399,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Near him, a youth, wan and emaciate,"
7400,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Leans on a female, by his side, in bloom"
7401,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of youthful beauty; while, at intervals,"
7402,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Whene'er the trumpet ceased to ring, is heard"
7403,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The breath of muttering, and the clank of chains.                 300"
7404,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"John sighed, and, turning to the stranger, said"
7405,ROMAN COMMANDER.,(For both were at the entrance of the cave):
7406,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Even to this desert spot in the lone waves,"
7407,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"War, and the ensigns and the sounds of war,                       304"
7408,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Have reached.
7409,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"His guest illustrious, with a smile,"
7410,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Answered: Yet this is the mere mimickry
7411,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of that appalling spectacle, that fills"
7412,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The world's wide scene with havoc and with blood;
7413,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The murmur of whose mighty coil goes up                           310
7414,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Still to the ear of Heaven. So man, the worm,"
7415,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Preys on his fellow-worm. Turn from the earth,"
7416,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"As gradual evening shades the sinking scene,"
7417,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And think upon its sins and strife no more.
7418,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Come, let us, on the stone, before the cave,"
7419,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"For all above is still and glorious,"
7420,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Sit down, and watch the stars as they steal out,"
7421,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"One after one, and garnish the pale cope"
7422,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of heaven. How bright the troops of Hesper shine,"
7423,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Above the shadow of yon farther rock,                             320"
7424,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Whose western side is lustrous; for the moon,"
7425,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Ascending in her car of glory, casts"
7426,ROMAN COMMANDER.,A meditative and a solemn light
7427,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"From cape to cape! Look! there is Helice,[177]"
7428,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Watched by the Grecian traders of the deep--
7429,ROMAN COMMANDER.,How clear she shines to-night above the sea!
7430,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"High in the zenith, here and there, apart,"
7431,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Some solitary stars, now scarce discerned,"
7432,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Seem to retire into the farthest space,"
7433,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"As if to shun the prouder planet's gaze,                          330"
7434,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Each in his watch, with never-blenching eye,"
7435,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Steadfast. Nor marvel, then the stranger said,"
7436,ROMAN COMMANDER.,When all the silent host of the blue sky
7437,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Appear so beautiful, Idolatry"
7438,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Should deem them gods, and to the Sun and Moon,"
7439,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Bel and Astarte, pay the worship due                              136"
7440,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"To the invisible, Almighty Lord,"
7441,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Who rules in heaven and earth.
7442,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Is there a God?
7443,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Yes! Nature cries aloud, There _is_ a God,"
7444,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Visible in his works, and infinite"
7445,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"In power! There is a God, and he is just!"
7446,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"There is a God, and he is merciful!"
7447,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Yet might we rather say, there is no God,"
7448,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Than think, that to a being such as man"
7449,ROMAN COMMANDER.,No revelation of bright hope was given:
7450,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"That man, created in God's image, placed"
7451,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Amid this vast and unknown universe,"
7452,ROMAN COMMANDER.,To sojourn upon earth a few brief years
7453,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of feverish life, should look, for the last time,                 350"
7454,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Hopeless, upon the setting sun, and die."
7455,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Oh! better be the worm that feeds on him.
7456,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With lifted gaze, the last Apostle cried,"
7457,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Fervently cried, Oh! yes, Lord Jesus Christ,"
7458,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Thou art the Christian's hope! but most of me--
7459,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of me, whom thou hast visited, and cheered"
7460,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Through life's long pilgrimage; of me, of me,"
7461,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"In age and solitude; I, too, shall live"
7462,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"When all the clouds of time are rolled away,"
7463,ROMAN COMMANDER.,For ever live in glory where thou art!                            360
7464,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Retiring to the cave, pausing, he turned"
7465,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"To his companion, but he was not there;"
7466,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"The moon shone, but there was no form or shape"
7467,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Of living thing; so lonely to his cave,"
7468,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"O'erwearied, John retired, there musing lay"
7469,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"On what he saw and heard, till sleep unawares"
7470,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Oppressed him, and that night--that only night--"
7471,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"He had not fallen upon his knees, and prayed,"
7472,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Protect me through this night, O Lord my God!"
7473,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"When, suddenly, a hiss was heard without,                         370"
7474,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And the dull hurtle, as of iron wings,"
7475,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And short and intermitted flames, at times,"
7476,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Lighted the cavern roof; then all again
7477,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Was dark, save when the moon dilated hung,"
7478,ROMAN COMMANDER.,And all again was still. John's heavy eyes
7479,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Were closed; and dreaming half, and half awake,"
7480,ROMAN COMMANDER.,He slumbered in the cavern. Who art thou?
7481,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Starting, he cried, and trembled, for strange eyes"
7482,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Glared through the dusk, and seemed to look at him."
7483,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"It was the coinage of the aged brain,                           380"
7484,ROMAN COMMANDER.,When sadness and the sense of loneliness
7485,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Oppress the weary heart! His eyes are closed
7486,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"A moment, when strange voices, in the air,"
7487,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Syllable words unknown, as mocking him,"
7488,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Then all is hushed again: from the dark roof
7489,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Fantastic and deriding shapes, half seen,"
7490,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Point down long fingers, and a laugh is heard"
7491,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"From the dark fissure of the rocky cave,"
7492,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Till even his shadow, by a moon-glance seen,"
7493,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Seems joining the fantastic mockery.                              390
7494,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Strange forms of beasts and birds, with monstrous beaks"
7495,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Solemnly nodding, in the dusk appear."
7496,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Yonder, by moonlight, all with heads hung down,"
7497,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"There moves a shrouded and a moping train,"
7498,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"But not a form distinctly visible,"
7499,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Save of a corpse, that silently they bear,"
7500,ROMAN COMMANDER.,On which the moonlight falls. Now a dark cloud
7501,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Is interposed, and the dim troop dissolves."
7502,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Forthwith a spectre, towering to the skies,"
7503,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Moves onward--on, directly to the cave;                           400"
7504,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"And, towering higher as he moves, he lifts--"
7505,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Half cloud and half anatomy--a dart,"
7506,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Barbed with fire, and a deep voice is heard,"
7507,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Through the involving clouds about his head:                      404
7508,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"I am Apollyon; dost thou sleep, old man?"
7509,ROMAN COMMANDER.,Tremble--and die!
7510,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"John raised his eyes, and prayed,"
7511,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Still shuddering, Save me, save me, Jesus Christ!"
7512,ROMAN COMMANDER.,The spectre vanished: some faint lightning shone
7513,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"At distance; and now gentler forms drew nigh,                     410"
7514,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"With airy minstrelsy of harps unseen,"
7515,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Surrounding him, like shadows of the blessed:"
7516,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Here, radiant female forms came gliding by;"
7517,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"There, in a stream of light, an angel turned"
7518,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"His look upon him, while soft voices sing:"
7519,ROMAN COMMANDER.,
7520,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Christian, dost thou yet remain"
7521,ROMAN COMMANDER.,In this weary world of pain?

7523,ROMAN COMMANDER.,When all beloved on earth are dead?
7524,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Hast thou oft, by years oppressed,                        420"
7525,ROMAN COMMANDER.,"Prayed for rest, eternal rest?"

7611,PART FIFTH.,"Slowly emerging, a vast orb of fire,"
7612,PART FIFTH.,Above the shadowy edge of ocean; now
7613,PART FIFTH.,"Flaming direct o'er Asia, with a stream                            28"

7648,PART FIFTH.,"Looked cold and dim, even in the morning sun;"
7649,PART FIFTH.,Such was the glory of the sudden blaze
7650,PART FIFTH.,That wrapped the mount. The crowd of lesser hills
7651,PART FIFTH.,"On to the city of Tiberias,"
7652,PART FIFTH.,"Appeared below o'er which the eagle sailed,"
7653,PART FIFTH.,"Mute, for his eyes yet blenched from the excess"

7655,PART FIFTH.,"With bursting splendour, where he slept. He flew,                  70"
7656,PART FIFTH.,"High soaring o'er the hills of Jezreel,"

7658,PART FIFTH.,"We fell upon the ground, and with our hands"

7661,PART FIFTH.,"Two, as of aged prophets, with their beards"

7663,PART FIFTH.,"And, buoyant in the air, his countenance"
7664,PART FIFTH.,"Bright as the sun, our Saviour's form appeared"
7665,PART FIFTH.,"Above them, while his vest, intensely white,                       80"
7666,PART FIFTH.,"Floated, as thus transfigured he arose."
7667,PART FIFTH.,"With clasped hands, and eyes upraised to heaven,"

7678,PART FIFTH.,"For they who held high converse, and whose forms,"
7679,PART FIFTH.,"Appeared in thinner air, above the blaze,"
7680,PART FIFTH.,Were gone with the departing cloud: his hand
7681,PART FIFTH.,"He placed upon our heads, and said, Fear not!                      96"
7682,PART FIFTH.,And that calm look of dignity and love
7683,PART FIFTH.,"Was placed upon us, as before. Again"
7684,PART FIFTH.,We saw the sun--the cloudless cope of heaven--
7685,PART FIFTH.,The long green valley of Esdraelon--                              100
7686,PART FIFTH.,"The pines of dewy Hermon, and the smoke"

7688,PART FIFTH.,"Her lost and only son, whom Jesus raised"
7689,PART FIFTH.,"From death's cold sleep, restoring to her tears"
7690,PART FIFTH.,Of joy; we saw the cavern and the cliffs
7691,PART FIFTH.,"Of Endor, where the wizard-woman called"
7692,PART FIFTH.,"Up from his sleep of death the prophet[178] old,"
7693,PART FIFTH.,To tell to trembling Saul his hour was come.
7694,PART FIFTH.,"Oh! hills, and streams, and plains of Palestine;"
7695,PART FIFTH.,"Scenes where we heard, long since, our Master's voice,"
7696,PART FIFTH.,"And saw his face! how often, with a tear,                         111"
7697,PART FIFTH.,"Have I remembered you, how often sighed:"
7698,PART FIFTH.,"Oh! for the swiftness of an eagle's wing,"
7699,PART FIFTH.,"That I might flee away, and visit you"
7700,PART FIFTH.,"Once more! But this great vision of the mount,"
7701,PART FIFTH.,"With shadowings of glory, was displayed,"
7702,PART FIFTH.,That we might be sustained in the dread day
7703,PART FIFTH.,"Of trial, when the very rocks should burst--"
7704,PART FIFTH.,"When, through deep darkness, the loud cry should come:"

7706,PART FIFTH.,"That we might be prepared, through every ill,"
7707,PART FIFTH.,"In peril and in pain, in life, in death;"

7710,PART FIFTH.,"Calm to take up our cross, and follow Him"
7711,PART FIFTH.,Who meekly bowed his head upon that cross;
7712,PART FIFTH.,"For if in this life only we had hope,"
7713,PART FIFTH.,"We were of all most miserable. Lord,"
7714,PART FIFTH.,"Thee have I followed, now in age, and poor,                       139"
7715,PART FIFTH.,Thy sufferings were for us--for us? for me;

7719,PART FIFTH.,"Come, Lord and Saviour! have I prayed in vain?"
7720,PART FIFTH.,Thou didst appear in glory on the mount;
7721,PART FIFTH.,"And thou hast come, even now, and cried, Fear not,"
7722,PART FIFTH.,"I live for evermore, and have the keys"
7723,PART FIFTH.,"Of death and hell. And wherefore should I fear,"
7724,PART FIFTH.,Now waiting only to depart in peace!
7725,PART FIFTH.,But I have wandered in my thoughts; this view                     150
7726,PART FIFTH.,"From this high mountain, and congenial thoughts,"
7727,PART FIFTH.,"Have waked the memory of that vision bright,"
7728,PART FIFTH.,"When once we saw, above the clouds of earth,"
7729,PART FIFTH.,Our Lord in glistening apparel shine.
7730,PART FIFTH.,Then he who stood upon the mountain's van
7731,PART FIFTH.,"With John, and gazed upon the seas below,"
7732,PART FIFTH.,"Said, Look towards the East: what dost thou see?"

7897,PART SIXTH.,Who crowned his hair with roses; trod the path
7898,PART SIXTH.,"Of love and pleasure, till the vision fled."

8722,PART FIRST.,"When evening comes, through the lone cottage pane,"
8723,PART FIRST.,"No light looks cheerful in the darkening plain,"
8724,PART FIRST.,"No soothing sounds stray the dim hills along,"
8725,PART FIRST.,No home-returning goat-herd trills the song;
8726,PART FIRST.,"At intervals, wild accents of despair,"
8727,PART FIRST.,"Or shouts are heard, or dismal nightfires glare;"
8728,PART FIRST.,But all is dark and silent near yon heap
8729,PART FIRST.,Where the fallen heroes of the hamlet sleep;
8730,PART FIRST.,"Save that, at times, a hollow groan is heard,"
8731,PART FIRST.,Or melancholy cry of the night-bird;
8732,PART FIRST.,"Save where some dog, amid the scene of death,"
8733,PART FIRST.,Moans as he watches yet his master's breath;                      170
8734,PART FIRST.,"Whilst with despair and love that seems to speak,"
8735,PART FIRST.,He licks the blood that stagnates on his cheek.
8736,PART FIRST.,"The morn looks through the hurrying clouds, the air"
8737,PART FIRST.,"Sighs as it lifts, at times, the dead man's hair;"
8738,PART FIRST.,"Upon those slaughtered heaps the cold stars shine,"
8739,PART FIRST.,"And Freedom sighs: The triumph, Gaul, is thine!"
8740,PART FIRST.,"Now dawns the morn o'er vales with blood defiled,"
8741,PART FIRST.,Where late affection's sweetest pictures smiled.
8742,PART FIRST.,O'er the still lake how sadly peals the bell
8743,PART FIRST.,That sounds of every earthly hope the knell!                      180
8744,PART FIRST.,"Pale on the crimsoned snow, without a home,"
8745,PART FIRST.,The sad survivors of that death-storm roam;
8746,PART FIRST.,"Their infants, outcast on the desert plain,"
8747,PART FIRST.,Demand their mothers and their sires in vain;
8748,PART FIRST.,"And when the red sun leaves the darkening sky,"
8749,PART FIRST.,Amid those gory tracks sit down and sigh.
8750,PART FIRST.,Shores of Lucerne! where many a winding bay
8751,PART FIRST.,Shone beauteous to the morn's returning ray;
8752,PART FIRST.,"Where rosy tints upon the blue lake shone,"
8753,PART FIRST.,And touched the rock with colours not their own;                  190
8754,PART FIRST.,"Who now, with eyes that swim in tenderness,                     191"
8755,PART FIRST.,Those scenes to every virtue dear shall bless!
8756,PART FIRST.,"What pleasure now can the rich landscape yield,"
8757,PART FIRST.,"The sparkling cataract, the pendent field,"
8758,PART FIRST.,"'Mid hoar declivities, the sunny tower"
8759,PART FIRST.,"Peering o'er beeches that its roof embower,"
8760,PART FIRST.,And cottage tops with light smoke trailing slow
8761,PART FIRST.,O'er the gray vapours looming far below!
8762,PART FIRST.,"Who shall ascend proud Pilate's[189] height, and mark"
8763,PART FIRST.,"The motley clouds sail o'er the champagne dark,                   200"
8764,PART FIRST.,"Now breaking in fantastic forms, and now"
8765,PART FIRST.,Dappling the distant promontory's brow?
8766,PART FIRST.,"Then when the sun, that lights the scene, rides high,"
8767,PART FIRST.,"And far away the scattered volumes fly,"
8768,PART FIRST.,"Look up to the great God that rules the world,"
8769,PART FIRST.,"By whom proud empires from their seats are hurled,"
8770,PART FIRST.,"And feel a glow of holy gratitude,"
8771,PART FIRST.,"That here, 'mid hollow glens and mountains rude,"
8772,PART FIRST.,"Far from Ambition's march and Discord's yell,"
8773,PART FIRST.,Content with Love and Happiness should dwell.                     210
8774,PART FIRST.,"Who now along those banks shall, listening, stray"
8775,PART FIRST.,"When evening lights each inlet west away,"
8776,PART FIRST.,And hear the solitary boatman's oar
8777,PART FIRST.,Dip duly as he nears the shaded shore;
8778,PART FIRST.,Or catch the whispers of the waterfall
8779,PART FIRST.,That through the ivied clefts swell musical?
8780,PART FIRST.,"These scenes, these sounds, could many a joy impart,"
8781,PART FIRST.,"With sadness mixed. The wandering youth, whose heart"
8782,PART FIRST.,"Was sick with many sorrows, resting here"
8783,PART FIRST.,"At such an hour, forgot his starting tear;                        220"
8784,PART FIRST.,"He felt a pensive calm, sweeter than sleep,"
8785,PART FIRST.,Steal gently o'er his aching breast; the deep
8786,PART FIRST.,And clear repose of the unruffled lake                            223
8787,PART FIRST.,"His spirit seemed, unconscious, to partake;"
8788,PART FIRST.,"And still the water, as it whispered near,"
8789,PART FIRST.,"Or high woods, as they rustled, soothed his ear,"
8790,PART FIRST.,Like the remembrance of a melody
8791,PART FIRST.,"Heard in his infant, happy years gone by."
8792,PART FIRST.,"Now in his distant country, when, with tears,"
8793,PART FIRST.,The tale of ruffian violence he hears;                            230
8794,PART FIRST.,"Hears that the spot which smiled with lovely gleam,"
8795,PART FIRST.,"Like some sweet image of a tender dream,"
8796,PART FIRST.,"Upon his morning path, is drenched with gore,"
8797,PART FIRST.,Its harmless tenants weltering on the shore;
8798,PART FIRST.,"He will exclaim, whilst from his breast he draws"
8799,PART FIRST.,"A deep, deep sigh, Avenge, O God, their cause!"
8800,PART FIRST.,Who would not sigh for Switzerland! What heart
8801,PART FIRST.,That ever bore in human woes a part;
8802,PART FIRST.,That ever felt affection's genuine flame;
8803,PART FIRST.,That ever leaped at injured Freedom's name;                       240
8804,PART FIRST.,"Would not for her dark foes feel honest hate,"
8805,PART FIRST.,And swell with indignation at her fate!
8806,PART FIRST.,If thus her lot of sorrow have impressed
8807,PART FIRST.,"Grief and resentment on a stranger's breast,"
8808,PART FIRST.,"How must he hear the cruel tale of death,"
8809,PART FIRST.,He who in these sad vales first drew his breath!
8810,PART FIRST.,"'Tis his perhaps in distant climes to roam,"
8811,PART FIRST.,Far from the shelter of his early home;
8812,PART FIRST.,"Yet still, as fancy paints the spot, he sees"
8813,PART FIRST.,"His father's cottage, and the mountain trees;                     250"
8814,PART FIRST.,Again by the wild streams he seems to rove;
8815,PART FIRST.,"He hears the voice of her who won his love,"
8816,PART FIRST.,"His heart's first love; for her he prunes the vine,"
8817,PART FIRST.,Whose clustering leaves the rustic porch entwine;
8818,PART FIRST.,The mountain's van together they ascend;
8819,PART FIRST.,They see Alps piled on Alps far on extend;
8820,PART FIRST.,"They mark the casual sunshine light the mass,                     257"
8821,PART FIRST.,Or vernal showers along the valley pass;
8822,PART FIRST.,"Whilst tinging the dark rocks, more lovely glow"
8823,PART FIRST.,The braided colours of heaven's humid bow.
8824,PART FIRST.,"But now the maid he loved, with whom all day"
8825,PART FIRST.,"He used in summer o'er the hills to stray,"
8826,PART FIRST.,"The faithful maid he loved--oh! cold despair,"
8827,PART FIRST.,"Freeze his warm life-blood; and that thrilling air,"
8828,PART FIRST.,"Which erst he sang, when, all alive to joy,"
8829,PART FIRST.,"He carolled on the Alps, a shepherd boy,"
8830,PART FIRST.,"Let him not hear it now, lest tears quick start,"
8831,PART FIRST.,And madness harrow up his broken heart!
8832,PART FIRST.,How touching was the simple strain! The tear
8833,PART FIRST.,Of memory started when it met the ear;                            270
8834,PART FIRST.,"And he whose front was rough with many a scar,"
8835,PART FIRST.,"Whose bold heart bounded at the trump of war,"
8836,PART FIRST.,"Stood all dissolved in sadness at its tone,"
8837,PART FIRST.,Remembering him of pleasant seasons gone.
8838,PART FIRST.,"Perhaps full many a heavy hour had passed,"
8839,PART FIRST.,Since in its native nooks he heard it last;
8840,PART FIRST.,"And when again its well-known music thrilled,"
8841,PART FIRST.,A thousand thronging recollections filled
8842,PART FIRST.,"His soul, that, sick with longing, homeward roved;"
8843,PART FIRST.,"Remote from scenes which most on earth he loved,                  280"
8844,PART FIRST.,"Cast on a world tempestuous, bleak, and wide,"
8845,PART FIRST.,More ardent for his once-loved hills he sighed;
8846,PART FIRST.,And sighed again to think how it might fare
8847,PART FIRST.,"With sisters, brothers, friends, and parents there;"
8848,PART FIRST.,"For be its music and its name forgot,"
8849,PART FIRST.,"The desert is his home, and those he loved are not!"
8850,PART FIRST.,
8851,PART FIRST.,
8852,PART SECOND.,PART SECOND.
8853,PART SECOND.,
8854,PART SECOND.,"I was a child of sorrow when I passed,"
8855,PART SECOND.,"Sweet country, through your rocky valleys last;"
8856,PART SECOND.,"For one whom I had loved, whom I had pressed"
8857,PART SECOND.,"With honest, ardent passion to my breast,"
8858,PART SECOND.,"Was to another vowed: I heard the tale,"
8859,PART SECOND.,"And to the earth sank heartless, faint, and pale."
8860,PART SECOND.,"Till that sad hour when every hope had flown,"
8861,PART SECOND.,"I thought she lived for me, and me alone;"
8862,PART SECOND.,"Yet did I not, though pangs my heart must rend,"
8863,PART SECOND.,Prove to thy weakness a sustaining friend?                         10
8864,PART SECOND.,"Did I not bid thee, never, never more"
8865,PART SECOND.,Or think of me or mine? As firm I swore
8866,PART SECOND.,"To cast away the dream, and bury deep,"
8867,PART SECOND.,"As in oblivion of the dead man's sleep,"
8868,PART SECOND.,"All that once soothed, and from the soul to tear"
8869,PART SECOND.,Each longing wish that youth had cherished there.
8870,PART SECOND.,"But when 'twas midnight, to the woods I hied,"
8871,PART SECOND.,"Despairing, and with frantic anguish cried:"
8872,PART SECOND.,"Oh, had relentless death with instant dart"
8873,PART SECOND.,Smitten and snatched thee from my bleeding heart;                  20
8874,PART SECOND.,"Through life had niggard fortune bid us pine,"
8875,PART SECOND.,And withered with despair thy hopes and mine;
8876,PART SECOND.,"Yes, yes, I could have borne it; but to see"
8877,PART SECOND.,"The accusing tear, and know it falls for me;"
8878,PART SECOND.,Oh cease the thought--a long and last farewell--
8879,PART SECOND.,We must forget--nor shall my soul rebel!
8880,PART SECOND.,"Then to my country's cliffs I bade adieu,"
8881,PART SECOND.,And what my sad heart felt God only knew.
8882,PART SECOND.,"Helvetia, thy rude scenes, a drooping guest,"
8883,PART SECOND.,"I sought, and sorrowing sought a spot of rest.                     30"
8884,PART SECOND.,Through many a mountain pass and shaggy vale                       31
8885,PART SECOND.,"I roamed an exile, passion-crazed and pale."
8886,PART SECOND.,"I saw your clouded heights sublime impend,"
8887,PART SECOND.,I heard your foaming cataracts descend;
8888,PART SECOND.,And oft the rugged scene my heart endued
8889,PART SECOND.,"With a strange, sad, distempered fortitude;"
8890,PART SECOND.,"Oft on the lake's green marge I lay reclined,"
8891,PART SECOND.,Murmuring my moody fancies to the wind;
8892,PART SECOND.,"But when some hanging hamlet I surveyed,"
8893,PART SECOND.,"A wood-cot peeping in the sheltered glade,                         40"
8894,PART SECOND.,"A tear, perforce, would steal; and, as my eye"
8895,PART SECOND.,"Fondly reverted to the days gone by,"
8896,PART SECOND.,"How blest, I cried, remote from every care,"
8897,PART SECOND.,"To rest with her we loved, forgotten there!"
8898,PART SECOND.,"Then soft, methought, from the sequestered grove,"
8899,PART SECOND.,I heard the song of happiness and love:
8900,PART SECOND.,
8901,PART SECOND.,"Come to these scenes of peace,"
8902,PART SECOND.,"Where, to rivers murmuring,"
8903,PART SECOND.,"The sweet birds all the summer sing,"
8904,PART SECOND.,"Where cares, and toil, and sadness cease!                     50"
8905,PART SECOND.,"Stranger, does thy heart deplore"
8906,PART SECOND.,Friends whom thou wilt see no more;
8907,PART SECOND.,Does thy wounded spirit prove
8908,PART SECOND.,"Pangs of hopeless, severed love?"
8909,PART SECOND.,"Thee the stream that gushes clear,"
8910,PART SECOND.,"Thee the birds that carol near,"
8911,PART SECOND.,"Shall soothe, as silent thou dost lie,"
8912,PART SECOND.,And dream of their wild lullaby;
8913,PART SECOND.,"Come to bless these scenes of peace,"
8914,PART SECOND.,"Where cares, and toil, and sadness cease!                     60"
8915,PART SECOND.,
8916,PART SECOND.,Start from the feeble dream! The woodland shed
8917,PART SECOND.,"Flames, and the tenants of that vale are dead!"
8918,PART SECOND.,All dark the torrent of their fate hath rushed;                    63
8919,PART SECOND.,Each cheering echo of the plain is hushed;
8920,PART SECOND.,"And every joyous, every tender sound,"
8921,PART SECOND.,In the loud roaring of the night-storm drowned.
8922,PART SECOND.,"How cheerily the rocks, from side to side,"
8923,PART SECOND.,Oft to the tabor's festive sounds replied!
8924,PART SECOND.,"There, when the bells upon a holiday"
8925,PART SECOND.,"Rang out, and all the villagers were gay,                          70"
8926,PART SECOND.,"In summer-time, the happy groups were seen;"
8927,PART SECOND.,"Youth linked with beauty bounded on the green,"
8928,PART SECOND.,"And age sat smiling, as the joyous train"
8929,PART SECOND.,"Round the tall May-pole, tapering from the plain,"
8930,PART SECOND.,"Their locks entwined with ribands streaming red,"
8931,PART SECOND.,"And crowned with flowers, the rural pastimes led."
8932,PART SECOND.,"Oh! on the bleeding turf the sad flowers throw,"
8933,PART SECOND.,And weep for them that sleep in dust below;
8934,PART SECOND.,"There sleep together, in their deathbed cold,"
8935,PART SECOND.,"The beautiful, the brave, the young, the old!                      80"
8936,PART SECOND.,No voice is heard that charmed their earthly road:
8937,PART SECOND.,Around their desolate and last abode
8938,PART SECOND.,"The blast that swept them to the earth yet raves,"
8939,PART SECOND.,And strews with havoc their insulted graves.
8940,PART SECOND.,As on the lucid lake's unruffled breast
8941,PART SECOND.,"Soft silvery lights and blending shadows rest,"
8942,PART SECOND.,"Above, around the heavens' blue calm is spread,"
8943,PART SECOND.,And sleeps the sunshine on the mountain's head;
8944,PART SECOND.,"Then purple rocks and woods smile to the eye,"
8945,PART SECOND.,Like fairy landscapes of the evening sky;                          90
8946,PART SECOND.,"And all is sad, save where some forest bird,"
8947,PART SECOND.,"With small and solitary trill, is heard."
8948,PART SECOND.,"Sudden the scene is changed, the hurricane"
8949,PART SECOND.,"Is up among the mountains, wind and rain"
8950,PART SECOND.,"Drive, and strange darkness closes on the vale;"
8951,PART SECOND.,And high rocks to the lightning glimmer pale;
8952,PART SECOND.,"And nought is heard but the deep thunder's roar,                   97"
8953,PART SECOND.,Or vultures screaming round the desert shore.
8954,PART SECOND.,"So mourns the prospect, changed and overcast,"
8955,PART SECOND.,And shrieks the spirit in the passing blast!
8956,PART SECOND.,But ah! how feller burst the ruthless storm
8957,PART SECOND.,That speeds the moral prospect to deform!
8958,PART SECOND.,"To-morrow, and the man of blood may see"
8959,PART SECOND.,Again fresh verdure deck the dripping tree;
8960,PART SECOND.,"Again pure splendour light yon bursting views,"
8961,PART SECOND.,And the clear lake reflect the fairest hues;
8962,PART SECOND.,"Whilst the gay lark seems, with a livelier voice,"
8963,PART SECOND.,"In scorn of his stern spirit, to rejoice."
8964,PART SECOND.,"But, hapless land, what dayspring shall restore"
8965,PART SECOND.,The lovelier morals that now smile no more!                       110
8966,PART SECOND.,"Affection tender as the murmuring dove,"
8967,PART SECOND.,That in the noiseless wood her home-nest wove;
8968,PART SECOND.,"And piety, that the blue mountains trod,"
8969,PART SECOND.,With kindling eyes upraised to nature's God;
8970,PART SECOND.,"Virtues that made thy streams, and woods, and hills,"
8971,PART SECOND.,"Thy lakes all sunshine, and thy shaded rills"
8972,PART SECOND.,"Like pictures of no earthly paradise,"
8973,PART SECOND.,Beaming remote from sorrow and from vice.
8974,PART SECOND.,"Far from the earthly scenes that wasteful lie,"
8975,PART SECOND.,"Virtue and peace, and arts and freedom fly;                       120"
8976,PART SECOND.,"Arts which the wild surrounding views inspired,"
8977,PART SECOND.,"And freedom, such as genuine patriots fired."
8978,PART SECOND.,"When the great sun sinks in the crimson west,"
8979,PART SECOND.,"And all the pines in golden pomp are dressed,"
8980,PART SECOND.,"Whose daring hand shall snatch the vivid light,"
8981,PART SECOND.,That purples o'er the promontory's height;
8982,PART SECOND.,And with a Loutherbourg's rich pencil throw
8983,PART SECOND.,On the warm tablet all the lucid glow?
8984,PART SECOND.,"When the slow convent's bell sounds from afar,"
8985,PART SECOND.,And the dim lake reflects the evening star;                       130
8986,PART SECOND.,When shall again the rapt enthusiast rove                         131
8987,PART SECOND.,And deck the visionary bower of love?
8988,PART SECOND.,"Hushed be the Doric strain, that, in the shade"
8989,PART SECOND.,"Of his own pines, the pensive Gesner played;"
8990,PART SECOND.,"Which oft the homeward-plodding woodman, near,"
8991,PART SECOND.,Paused with his gray beard on his staff to hear;
8992,PART SECOND.,"Whilst his lean dog, whose opening lips disclose,"
8993,PART SECOND.,"Just peeping forth, his white teeth's even rows,"
8994,PART SECOND.,"Lifted his long ears with sagacious heed,"
8995,PART SECOND.,And fixed his full eye on his trilling reed!                      140
8996,PART SECOND.,"High on the broad Alps' solitary van,"
8997,PART SECOND.,"Where not a sound is heard of busy man,"
8998,PART SECOND.,"Hark! with loud orgies, o'er the bloody dew,"
8999,PART SECOND.,Lewd Comus leads his nightly madding crew!
9000,PART SECOND.,"Strong shouts and clangours through the high wood run,"
9001,PART SECOND.,And distant arms flash to the sinking sun;
9002,PART SECOND.,"Dark forests their lone empire, the tall rocks"
9003,PART SECOND.,"Their shelter, and their wealth their wandering flocks."
9004,PART SECOND.,"To the proud Macedon, whose conquering car"
9005,PART SECOND.,Rolled terrible through the ranks of armed war;                   150
9006,PART SECOND.,Whose banners chilled the plain with fearful shade;
9007,PART SECOND.,"Whose sovereignty a thousand trumpets brayed,"
9008,PART SECOND.,"The Scythian chiefs spoke nobly: What have we,"
9009,PART SECOND.,"King of the world, to do with thine or thee?"
9010,PART SECOND.,"Far o'er the snowy solitudes we roam,"
9011,PART SECOND.,Or by wild rivers fix our casual home.
9012,PART SECOND.,O'er the green champagne let thy cities shine;
9013,PART SECOND.,We ne'er invaded fields or seats of thine;
9014,PART SECOND.,"Nor will we bow, proud lord, at thy decree;"
9015,PART SECOND.,"Hence, hence, and leave us to our forests free!                   160"
9016,PART SECOND.,"But the stern soldier, with war's banners spread,"
9017,PART SECOND.,Through thy still vales his glittering squadrons led;
9018,PART SECOND.,"And wild despair, and unrelenting hate.                           163"
9019,PART SECOND.,Stalk o'er thine inmost valleys desolate;
9020,PART SECOND.,"And she, that like the nimble mountain roe,"
9021,PART SECOND.,"With step scarce heard, went bounding o'er the snow;"
9022,PART SECOND.,"She whose green buskins swept the frosts of morn,"
9023,PART SECOND.,Who walked the high wood with her bugle horn;
9024,PART SECOND.,"She who once called these hills her own, and found"
9025,PART SECOND.,"Her loveliest sojourn 'mid the hallowed ground,                   170"
9026,PART SECOND.,"Blessing the spot where, shaded with high wood,"
9027,PART SECOND.,"And decked with simple flowers, her altar stood;"
9028,PART SECOND.,"Freedom insulted sees, as pale she flies,"
9029,PART SECOND.,A monster phantom in her name arise!
9030,PART SECOND.,"On weltering carcases it seems to stand,"
9031,PART SECOND.,Waving a dim-seen dagger in its hand;
9032,PART SECOND.,"Its look is unrelenting as the grave,"
9033,PART SECOND.,Around its brow the muttering whirlwinds rave;
9034,PART SECOND.,"Its spreading shadow chills the scene beneath,"
9035,PART SECOND.,"Ah! fly--it onward moves, and murmurs, Death!                     180"
9036,PART SECOND.,"Earth fades beneath its footstep, and around"
9037,PART SECOND.,Long sighs and distant dying shrieks resound![190]
9038,PART SECOND.,"Could arms alone o'er thy brave sons prevail,"
9039,PART SECOND.,"Helvetia? No, it was the fraudful tale"
9040,PART SECOND.,Of this false phantom which the heart misled;
9041,PART SECOND.,"That spoke of peace, peace to the poor man's shed,"
9042,PART SECOND.,"Then left him, houseless, to the tempest's gloom"
9043,PART SECOND.,That swept his hopes and comforts to the tomb!
9044,PART SECOND.,"High towered the grisly spectre, half concealed,"
9045,PART SECOND.,And gathering clouds its dismal forests veiled;                   190
9046,PART SECOND.,"The clouds disperse, and lo! 'mid murderous bands,"
9047,PART SECOND.,Dark in its might the hideous phantom stands!
9048,PART SECOND.,Now see the triumph of its reign complete!
9049,PART SECOND.,Behold it throned in its own sovereign seat!
9050,PART SECOND.,"The orgies peal, the banners wave on high,                        195"
9051,PART SECOND.,And dark rocks ring to shouts of liberty!
9052,PART SECOND.,"Now, soldier, lift thy loud acclaiming voice!"
9053,PART SECOND.,"Children of high-souled sentiment, rejoice!"
9054,PART SECOND.,"Round the scathed tree, upon the desert plain,"
9055,PART SECOND.,Dance o'er the victims of the village slain!                      200
9056,PART SECOND.,"Thou who dost smiling sit, as fancy flings"
9057,PART SECOND.,"Her hues unreal o'er created things,"

9123,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
9124,PREFACE.,
9125,PREFACE.,The following compositions were written originally to be learned by
9126,PREFACE.,"heart by poor children of my own parish, who have been instructed"
9127,PREFACE.,"every Sunday through the summer, on the garden lawn before the"
9128,PREFACE.,"parsonage house, by Mrs Bowles. The object, which, to the best of"
9129,PREFACE.,"my knowledge, is entirely novel, was briefly to describe the most"
9130,PREFACE.,"obvious images in country life, familiar to every child; and in the"
9131,PREFACE.,smallest compass to connect every distinct picture with the
9132,PREFACE.,"earliest feelings of humanity and piety, in language which the"
9133,PREFACE.,"simplest might understand; but which, from the objects represented,"
9134,PREFACE.,"might be read, perhaps, with some interest by those whose minds"
9135,PREFACE.,were more cultivated. About fourteen of these little poems were
9136,PREFACE.,composed with this view many years ago; but it was not thought of
9137,PREFACE.,"extending their knowledge beyond the village circle, to which they"
9138,PREFACE.,"were originally limited, except by a very few copies given away. I"
9139,PREFACE.,"have now added to the number, and revised the whole; thinking that,"
9140,PREFACE.,"when early education is so greatly extended, they may be found upon"
9141,PREFACE.,a wider scale to answer the purpose for which they were written.
9142,PREFACE.,They may also prove acceptable to mothers in a higher station of
9143,PREFACE.,"life, who might wish to impress upon the memory of their children"
9144,PREFACE.,"as they grow up, a love of natural scenes, combined with the"
9145,PREFACE.,"earliest feelings of sympathy and religion. Some of these verses,"
9146,PREFACE.,"such as ""The Mower,"" ""The Swan,"" _etc._, are purposely designed for"
9147,PREFACE.,the exercise of a more advanced intellect.

10164,SONG OF THE CID.[194],

10166,SONG OF THE CID.[194],"He said, it should be so;"
