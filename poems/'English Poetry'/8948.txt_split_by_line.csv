46,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,THE FEAR OF DEATH.
47,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,
48,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,
49,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Thou! whose superior, and aspiring mind"
50,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Can leave the weakness of thy sex behind;
51,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Above its follies, and its fears can rise,"
52,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Quit the low earth, and gain the distant skies:"
53,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Whom strength of soul and innocence have taught
54,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"To think of death, nor shudder at the thought;"
55,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Say! whence the dread, that can alike engage"
56,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Vain thoughtless youth, and deep-reflecting age;"
57,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Can shake the feeble, and appal the strong;"
58,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Say! whence the terrors, that to death belong?"
59,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Guilt must be fearful: but the guiltless too
60,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Start from the grave, and tremble at the view."
61,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"The blood-stained pirate, who in neighbouring climes,"
62,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Might fear, lest justice should o'ertake his crimes,"
63,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Wisely may bear the sea's tempestuous roar,"
64,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"And rather wait the storm, than make the shore;"
65,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"But can the mariner, who sailed in vain"
66,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"In search of fancy'd treasure on the main,"
67,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"By hope deceiv'd, by endless whirlwinds tost,"
68,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"His strength exhausted, and his viands lost,"
69,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,When land invites him to receive at last
70,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,A full reward for every danger past:
71,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Can he then wish his labours to renew,"
72,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And fly the port just opening to his view?
73,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Not less the folly of the timorous mind,"
74,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Which dreads that peace, it ever longs to find;"
75,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Which worn with age, and tost in endless strife"
76,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"On this rough ocean, this tempestuous life,"
77,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Still covets pain, and shakes with abject fear,"
78,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"When sickness points to death, and shews the haven near."
79,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"The love of life, it yet must be confest,"
80,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Was fixed by Nature in the human breast;
81,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And Heaven thought fit that fondness to employ.
82,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,To teach us to preserve the brittle toy.
83,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"But why, when knowledge has improv'd our thought,"
84,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Years undeceived us, and affliction taught;"
85,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Why do we strive to grasp with eager hand,"
86,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And stop the course of life's quick-ebbing sand?
87,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Why vainly covet, what we can't sustain?"
88,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Why, dead to pleasure, would we live to pain?"
89,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"What is this sentence, from which all would fly?"
90,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Oh! what this horrible decree--to die?
91,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Tis but to quit, what hourly we despise"
92,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"A fretful dream, that tortures as it flies.--"
93,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,But hold my pen!--nor let a picture stand
94,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Thus darkly coloured by this gloomy hand:
95,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Minds deeply wounded, or with spleen opprest,"
96,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Grow sick of life, and sullen sink to rest:"
97,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"But when the soul, possest of its desires,"
98,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Glows with more warmth, and burns with brighter fires;"
99,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"When friendship soothes each care, and love imparts"
100,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Its mutual raptures to congenial hearts;
101,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"When joyful life thus strikes the ravish'd eye,"
102,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"'Tis then a task, a painful task to die."
103,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"See! where Philario, poor Philario! lies,"
104,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Philario late the happy, as the wise!"
105,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Connubial love, and friendship's pleasing power"
106,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Fill'd his good heart, and crown'd his every hour:"
107,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"But sickness bids him those lost joys deplore,"
108,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"And death now tells him, they are his no more."
109,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Blest in each name of Husband, Father, Friend,"
110,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Must those strong ties, those dear connexions end?"
111,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Must be thus leave to all the woes of life
112,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"His helpless child, his unprotected wife?"
113,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"While thus to earth these lov'd ideas bind,"
114,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And tear his lab'ring--his distracted mind:
115,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,How shall that mind its wretched fate defy?
116,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"How calm his trouble, and how learn to die?"
117,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,In vain would Faith before his eyes display
118,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,The opening realms of never-ending day;
119,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Superior love his faithful soul detains
120,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Bound, strongly bound, in Adamantine chains."
121,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,But lo! the gates of pitying Heaven unfold:
122,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"A form, that earth rejoices to behold."
123,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Descends: her energy with sweetness join'd,"
124,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Speaks the bright mission for relief design'd:
125,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,See! to Philario moves the flood of light;
126,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And Resignation bursts upon his sight:
127,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"See! to the Cross, bedew'd with sacred gore,"
128,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Humbly she points, and bids the world adore;"
129,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Then sweetly breathing in his soul inspires
130,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"A Christian spirit, and devout desires.--"
131,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Hark! his last wish, his dying pray'r's begun:"
132,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"""Lord, as in Heaven, on earth thy will be done!"""
133,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Calm is his soul; his painful struggles cease;
134,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"He bows adoring, and expires in peace."
135,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,O! Resignation; thou unerring guide
136,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"To human weakness, and to earthly pride,"
137,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Friend to Distress, who canst alone controul"
138,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Each rising tumult in the mad'ning soul;
139,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"'Tis thine alone from dark despair to save,"
140,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"To soothe the woes of life, and terrors of the grave:"
141,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Thro' this rough world assist me with thy power!
142,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Calm every thought! adorn my latest hour,"
143,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Sustain my spirit, and confirm my mind,"
144,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Serene tho' feeling, chearful tho' resign'd!"
145,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"And thou! my friend, while thus in artless verse"
146,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Thy mind I copy, and thy thoughts rehearse;"
147,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Let one memorial, tho' unpolish'd, stand"
148,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Rais'd to thy friendship by this grateful hand!
149,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"By partial favour let my verse be tried,"
150,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And 'gainst thy judgement let thy love decide!
151,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Tho' I no longer must thy converse share,"
152,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Hear thy kind counsel, see thy pleasing care;"
153,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Yet mem'ry still upon the past shall dwell,"
154,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And still the wishes of my heart shall tell:
155,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"O! be the cup of joy to thee consign'd,"
156,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Of joy unmix'd, without a dreg behind!"
157,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"For no rough monitor thy soul requires,"
158,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,To check the frenzy of too rash desires;
159,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"No poignant grief, to prove its latent worth,"
160,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,No pain to wean it from the toys of earth;
161,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,Thy soul untroubled can alike survey
162,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"This gloomy world, and Heaven's immortal day:"
163,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Then while the current of thy blood shall flow,"
164,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,While Heaven yet lends thee to thy friends below;
165,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Round thee may pleasure spread a chearful scene,"
166,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"Mild as thy heart, and as thy soul serene!"
167,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"And O! when Time shall bid thee yield thy breath,"
168,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"And take thy passage thro' the gates of death,"
169,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,"May that last path without a pang be trod,"
170,THE FEAR OF DEATH.,And one short sigh conduct thee to thy God!

183,FELPHAM.,
184,FELPHAM.,Hail Felpham! Hail! in youth my favorite scene!
185,FELPHAM.,First in my heart of villages marine!
186,FELPHAM.,"To me thy waves confirm'd my truest wealth,"
187,FELPHAM.,"My only parent's renovated health,"
188,FELPHAM.,"Whose love maternal, and whose sweet discourse"
189,FELPHAM.,Gave to my feelings all their cordial force:
190,FELPHAM.,"Hence mindful, how her tender spirit blest"
191,FELPHAM.,"Thy salutary air, and balmy rest;"
192,FELPHAM.,"Thee, as profuse of recollections sweet,"
193,FELPHAM.,"Fit for a pensive veteran's calm retreat,"
194,FELPHAM.,"I chose, as provident for sure decay,"
195,FELPHAM.,A nest for age in life's declining day!
196,FELPHAM.,"Reserving Eartham for a darling son,"
197,FELPHAM.,Confiding in our threads of life unspun:
198,FELPHAM.,"Blind to futurity!--O blindness, given"
199,FELPHAM.,As mercy's boon to man from pitying Heaven!
200,FELPHAM.,"Man could not live, if his prophetic eyes"
201,FELPHAM.,"View'd all afflictions, ere they will arise."
202,FELPHAM.,"Think, gentle friend, who saw'st, in chearful hour"
203,FELPHAM.,"Thy poet planning a sequestered tower,"
204,FELPHAM.,"And gayly rearing, in affection's pride,"
205,FELPHAM.,His little villa by the ocean's side;
206,FELPHAM.,"Encircled then by friendly artists, three,"
207,FELPHAM.,"Full of sweet fancy, and of social glee,"
208,FELPHAM.,Think what sensations must have pierc'd his breast
209,FELPHAM.,Had a prophetic voice this truth exprest:
210,FELPHAM.,O'er thy new fabric ere six year's have fled
211,FELPHAM.,Lonely thou'lt mourn all these dear inmates dead.
212,FELPHAM.,"The unrelenting grave absorb'd them all,"
213,FELPHAM.,"And in the shade of this domestic wall,"
214,FELPHAM.,"Which, as it rose re-echoed to their voice,"
215,FELPHAM.,And heard them in gay presages rejoice
216,FELPHAM.,"Of future studies, works of special note!"
217,FELPHAM.,"That each, to deck these precincts, would devote."
218,FELPHAM.,"Here robb'd of them, their leader, and their friend,"
219,FELPHAM.,"Of their kind visions feels the mournful end,"
220,FELPHAM.,"Afflicted, and alone!--Yet not alone!"
221,FELPHAM.,Their hovering spirits make this scene their own.
222,FELPHAM.,O sweet prerogative of love sublime!
223,FELPHAM.,"Which so can soften destiny, and time,"
224,FELPHAM.,"That grief-worn hearts, by Fancy's charm revive!"
225,FELPHAM.,The lost are present! the deceas'd alive!
226,FELPHAM.,Yes! ye dear buried inmates of my mind!
227,FELPHAM.,Your converse still within these walls I find;
228,FELPHAM.,"In hours of study, and in hours of rest,"
229,FELPHAM.,You still to me my purest thoughts suggest:
230,FELPHAM.,My heart's propensities you cherish still
231,FELPHAM.,To Heaven thanksgiving! and to earth good-will!
232,FELPHAM.,"In you I still behold affection's smile,"
233,FELPHAM.,Which can all troubles of the heart beguile;
234,FELPHAM.,"I hear your kind approvance of my zeal,"
235,FELPHAM.,"When, anxious all your merits to reveal,"
236,FELPHAM.,"Having consign'd your bones to sacred earth,"
237,FELPHAM.,My mind aspir'd to memorize your worth.
238,FELPHAM.,Grateful employment of the feeling soul!
239,FELPHAM.,"That, in despite of sorrow's dark controul"
240,FELPHAM.,Keeps the pure form of deathless virtue bright
241,FELPHAM.,By just commemoration's soothing light!
242,FELPHAM.,"For such employment thou wast aptly made,"
243,FELPHAM.,Thou dear sequester'd cell! in whose calm shade
244,FELPHAM.,"Thy lonely bard might suit his plaintive strain,"
245,FELPHAM.,To solemn music from the murmuring main!
246,FELPHAM.,Belov'd marine retreat! I oft recall
247,FELPHAM.,"The night, I first repos'd within thy wall:"
248,FELPHAM.,"A night devoted, at a friend's desire,"
249,FELPHAM.,To touch the chords of a sepulchral lyre!
250,FELPHAM.,Touch'd not in vain!--The faithful tribute brought
251,FELPHAM.,"To cureless grief the lenitive, she sought;"
252,FELPHAM.,"And Lushington, thro' tearful anguish, smil'd"
253,FELPHAM.,On truth's memorial of her darling child.
254,FELPHAM.,"Little I thought, when eager to bestow"
255,FELPHAM.,"The heart's pure offering on parental woe,"
256,FELPHAM.,"How soon my filial pride, and friend most dear,"
257,FELPHAM.,"Would claim the ""meed of a melodious tear."""
258,FELPHAM.,Dear sacred shades of Cowper! and my Son!
259,FELPHAM.,"Who, in my fond affection, liv'd as one!"
260,FELPHAM.,Congenial inmates! on whose loss I found
261,FELPHAM.,The sweetest light of life in darkness drown'd!
262,FELPHAM.,"Oft have ye witness'd, while, in this calm cell,"
263,FELPHAM.,"Ye watch'd the lonely bard, ye lov'd so well,"
264,FELPHAM.,"Oft have ye witness'd, how his struggling mind"
265,FELPHAM.,"Labour'd affliction's fetters to unbind,"
266,FELPHAM.,Ere his o'er-burthen'd faculties could cope
267,FELPHAM.,"With that ambitious task of tender hope,"
268,FELPHAM.,To render justice to you both; and frame                       }
269,FELPHAM.,Memorials worthy of each honour'd name:                    }
270,FELPHAM.,"A debt the heart must feel! & truth, and nature claim!  }"
271,FELPHAM.,"Your smile, dear visionary guests of night!"
272,FELPHAM.,O'er my nocturnal hours breath'd new delight;
273,FELPHAM.,"Made me exult in labour, plann'd for you!"
274,FELPHAM.,Its progress from your inspiration grew:
275,FELPHAM.,"The toil was sweet, that your approvance cheer'd;"
276,FELPHAM.,"For what your love inspir'd, that love endear'd."
277,FELPHAM.,"Nor unregarded by the fair, and great,"
278,FELPHAM.,Was your recluse in this sequester'd state;
279,FELPHAM.,"When I began, by just records, to prove"
280,FELPHAM.,How Cowper merited our country's love;
281,FELPHAM.,The loveliest regent of poetic taste;
282,FELPHAM.,First of the fair; with all attractions grac'd!
283,FELPHAM.,Friend of the muses! and herself a muse!
284,FELPHAM.,"Her bright eyes dimm'd with sorrow's sacred dews,"
285,FELPHAM.,"The high-born beauty, in whose lot combin'd"
286,FELPHAM.,"All--that could charm and grieve a feeling mind,"
287,FELPHAM.,"Shar'd with me, in my cell, some pensive hours;"
288,FELPHAM.,"Herself most eloquent on Cowper's powers,"
289,FELPHAM.,Urg'd to his willing Eulogist his claim
290,FELPHAM.,"To public gratitude, and purest fame."
291,FELPHAM.,"The memoir, as by gradual toil it grows,"
292,FELPHAM.,"Endears the tranquil scene, in which it rose;"
293,FELPHAM.,"And sheds, since public favor blest the page,"
294,FELPHAM.,A soothing lustre on my letter'd age.
295,FELPHAM.,The dues of faithful memory fondly paid
296,FELPHAM.,"To him, devotion's bard! dear sacred shade!"
297,FELPHAM.,Then my paternal hand was prompt to raise
298,FELPHAM.,"To that blest pupil, who had shar'd his praise"
299,FELPHAM.,A similar record of tender truth;
300,FELPHAM.,The genuine portraiture of studious youth--
301,FELPHAM.,"Task of such pleasing pain, as pierc'd the heart"
302,FELPHAM.,"Of Daedalus, the sire of antient art!"
303,FELPHAM.,"When, in fond zeal, his busy hand begun"
304,FELPHAM.,"To mould the story of his hapless son,"
305,FELPHAM.,"But falter'd, while, o'erwhelm'd in mournful thought,"
306,FELPHAM.,"He work'd, and wept upon the work, he wrought."
307,FELPHAM.,Ah peerless youth! whose highly-gifted hand
308,FELPHAM.,"Could all varieties of skill command,"
309,FELPHAM.,Ere illness undermin'd thy powers to use
310,FELPHAM.,"The Sculptor's chizzel, and the Painter's hues!"
311,FELPHAM.,"Had thy ascending talents, unenchain'd,"
312,FELPHAM.,"Of studious life the promis'd zenith gain'd,"
313,FELPHAM.,Confederate arts would then have joy'd to see
314,FELPHAM.,Their English Michael Angelo in thee.
315,FELPHAM.,"But never be it by true love forgot,"
316,FELPHAM.,"Thou hast a higher, and a happier lot!"
317,FELPHAM.,"The prime of blessings, in a world like this,"
318,FELPHAM.,Is early transit to the realms of bliss:
319,FELPHAM.,Thence thy pure spirit oft will charm to rest
320,FELPHAM.,"Those pangs of fond regret, that pierce my breast,"
321,FELPHAM.,When recollection mournfully surveys
322,FELPHAM.,Unfinish'd products of thy studious days.
323,FELPHAM.,Ah what a host of filial fair designs:
324,FELPHAM.,"Where, springing from the heart, the fancy shines,"
325,FELPHAM.,"Thy enterprising mind had here bestow'd,"
326,FELPHAM.,To honour Felpham as thy sire's abode!
327,FELPHAM.,All to thy mental eyes were present here;
328,FELPHAM.,"The scene, we join'd to deck, all yet endear,"
329,FELPHAM.,"Tho' hardly embrios of plastic grace,"
330,FELPHAM.,"Many yet want their features, and their place."
331,FELPHAM.,"These vacant circlets, that still court mine eye,"
332,FELPHAM.,"Can I survey, without a bursting sigh,"
333,FELPHAM.,When fond remembrance tells me that from these
334,FELPHAM.,"Thy filial hand, tho' robb'd of strength and ease,"
335,FELPHAM.,"Yet inly conscious of ingenious power,"
336,FELPHAM.,"Resolv'd, in labour's first reviving hour,"
337,FELPHAM.,"To fashion portraits claiming just regard,"
338,FELPHAM.,The Tuscan sculptor! and the Grecian bard!
339,FELPHAM.,Whom 'twas thy hope in marble to create
340,FELPHAM.,As honour'd guardians of thy poet's gate;
341,FELPHAM.,"There is no spot within this Villa's bound,"
342,FELPHAM.,"E'en to the Turret's topmost airy round,"
343,FELPHAM.,"Which thy kind fancy, that no ills could check."
344,FELPHAM.,With sweet ideal projects fail'd to deck:
345,FELPHAM.,"Eager to fix around, below, above,"
346,FELPHAM.,"Proofs of thy skill, and monuments of love!"
347,FELPHAM.,"Thy gay activity how passing sweet,"
348,FELPHAM.,Ere this arising structure was complete!
349,FELPHAM.,"When 'twas our joy its scaffolds to ascend,"
350,FELPHAM.,And mark how bright its varied views extend;
351,FELPHAM.,To search how far the glass-assisted eye
352,FELPHAM.,"May scenes of splendor, and of peace, descry!"
353,FELPHAM.,"The first, where, blazing in the gorgeous west,"
354,FELPHAM.,"The sun delights on Vecta's hills to rest,"
355,FELPHAM.,"And gild those fleets, that, when they cease to roam;"
356,FELPHAM.,Come fraught with glory to her favorite home;
357,FELPHAM.,"The second, where, in softer northern light,"
358,FELPHAM.,"Eartham, lov'd little hill, allures the sight,"
359,FELPHAM.,"And towering woods, that crown the loftier Nore,"
360,FELPHAM.,"Salute our seamen, as they near the shore!"
361,FELPHAM.,"Ye scenes, that live in memory's regard."
362,FELPHAM.,Whose quiet beauty charm'd your pensive bard!
363,FELPHAM.,"In hopes his eye might long delight to trace,"
364,FELPHAM.,"Tho' distant, visible, your rural grace;"
365,FELPHAM.,"In hopes of tender love, not idle pride!"
366,FELPHAM.,"He rear'd his turret by the ocean's side,"
367,FELPHAM.,"Lofty, tho' little! that his sight might still"
368,FELPHAM.,Enjoy sweet intercourse with Eartham-hill;
369,FELPHAM.,"Where, while his heart with pure ambition glow'd,"
370,FELPHAM.,The filial artist plann'd his own abode;
371,FELPHAM.,"And by a telegraph, his skill design'd,"
372,FELPHAM.,"Endearing mark of his inventive mind,"
373,FELPHAM.,"He meant to hold, as mutual wants require,"
374,FELPHAM.,Constant communion with his absent sire:
375,FELPHAM.,"Fair purpose! furnishing much kind employ,"
376,FELPHAM.,And oft a subject of ideal joy
377,FELPHAM.,"To hearts, forbid by mercy to foresee,"
378,FELPHAM.,"How soon the heaven-taught youth, by heaven's decree"
379,FELPHAM.,"Must leave the favorite hill, that charm'd his eyes,"
380,FELPHAM.,In early transit to serener skies!
381,FELPHAM.,Angel! yet visible to mental sight!
382,FELPHAM.,"Still let me, pensive in my Turret's height,"
383,FELPHAM.,"Whose view of heaven unbroken, unconfin'd"
384,FELPHAM.,Fixes the lifted eye and fills the mind;
385,FELPHAM.,"Let love, ascending from earth's dark abyss,"
386,FELPHAM.,Still commune with thee in thy scene of bliss!
387,FELPHAM.,Sole meditation on thy heavenly worth.
388,FELPHAM.,Transcending all the social joys of earth;
389,FELPHAM.,"To purest fancy giving boundless scope,"
390,FELPHAM.,Turns worldly trouble to celestial hope.
391,FELPHAM.,My stedfast friend! unchang'd by chance and time!
392,FELPHAM.,"Pure in the wane of life, as in its prime;"
393,FELPHAM.,
