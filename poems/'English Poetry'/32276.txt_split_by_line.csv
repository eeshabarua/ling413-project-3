40,THE BANKRUPT.,THE BANKRUPT.
41,THE BANKRUPT.,
42,THE BANKRUPT.,
43,THE BANKRUPT.,"Oft have you pray'd me, when in youth,"
44,THE BANKRUPT.,Never to err from paths of truth;
45,THE BANKRUPT.,"But youth to vice is much too prone,"
46,THE BANKRUPT.,"And mine by far too much, I own."
47,THE BANKRUPT.,"Induced to riot, swear, and game,"
48,THE BANKRUPT.,I thought in vice t'acquire fame;
49,THE BANKRUPT.,But found the pois'ning scenes of riot
50,THE BANKRUPT.,Soon robb'd my mind of joy and quiet.
51,THE BANKRUPT.,"The usual course of rakes I ran,"
52,THE BANKRUPT.,The dupe of woman and of man.
53,THE BANKRUPT.,"Careless of fortune's smile or frown,"
54,THE BANKRUPT.,"My desk I left t'enjoy the town,"
55,THE BANKRUPT.,"At folly dash'd in wisdom's spite,"
56,THE BANKRUPT.,"Idled by day, revell'd by night:"
57,THE BANKRUPT.,"But short was that delusive scene,"
58,THE BANKRUPT.,And I awoke to sorrow keen.
59,THE BANKRUPT.,"Debt press'd on debt: I could not pay,"
60,THE BANKRUPT.,And found that credit had its day.
61,THE BANKRUPT.,"No friend to aid, what should I do?"
62,THE BANKRUPT.,I made bad worse: to liquor flew:
63,THE BANKRUPT.,"For when my bill-book I survey'd,"
64,THE BANKRUPT.,"I shrunk, as if I'd seen my shade;"
65,THE BANKRUPT.,"And to drive terror from my mind,"
66,THE BANKRUPT.,"Drank on, and care gave to the wind:"
67,THE BANKRUPT.,But wine nor words can charm away
68,THE BANKRUPT.,The banker's clerk who comes for pay.
69,THE BANKRUPT.,"Payment is press'd, the cash is gone:"
70,THE BANKRUPT.,"Too late I cry, 'what must be done?'"
71,THE BANKRUPT.,Horrow! a docket struck appears:
72,THE BANKRUPT.,"I look aghast, my wife's in tears."
73,THE BANKRUPT.,"The naked truth stares in my face,"
74,THE BANKRUPT.,And shows me more than one disgrace.
75,THE BANKRUPT.,My keys a messenger demands;
76,THE BANKRUPT.,"While, as a culprit often stands,"
77,THE BANKRUPT.,"The humbled bankrupt lowers his view,"
78,THE BANKRUPT.,And sees the law its work pursue.
79,THE BANKRUPT.,"Soon comes of all his goods, the sale;"
80,THE BANKRUPT.,"Which, like light straw before a gale,"
81,THE BANKRUPT.,"The hammer-man puffs clean away,"
82,THE BANKRUPT.,"And cries, 'they must be sold this day.'"
83,THE BANKRUPT.,"They are so, and I'll tell you how:"
84,THE BANKRUPT.,At loss you'll readily allow.
85,THE BANKRUPT.,"Then comes the tedious, humbling task,"
86,THE BANKRUPT.,To answer all commiss'ners ask;
87,THE BANKRUPT.,"And those who mean to act most fair,"
88,THE BANKRUPT.,"Will at first meeting e'er appear,"
89,THE BANKRUPT.,"To questions ask'd will answer true,"
90,THE BANKRUPT.,And clearly state accounts to view.
91,THE BANKRUPT.,"A second he need not attend,"
92,THE BANKRUPT.,But if not may perhaps offend.
93,THE BANKRUPT.,Happy the man who then can lay
94,THE BANKRUPT.,"His hand upon his heart, and say,"
95,THE BANKRUPT.,'You all my books and deeds may scan
96,THE BANKRUPT.,"I'm honest, though distress'd man."
97,THE BANKRUPT.,"My own just wants, and losses great,"
98,THE BANKRUPT.,Have brought me to this low estate.'
99,THE BANKRUPT.,"Then comes the last dread meeting on,"
100,THE BANKRUPT.,"Dreadful to such as will act wrong,"
101,THE BANKRUPT.,And through dishonesty or shame
102,THE BANKRUPT.,Evasive answers 'tempt to frame:
103,THE BANKRUPT.,"For vain his shifts; howe'er he try,"
104,THE BANKRUPT.,He can't elude the searching eye
105,THE BANKRUPT.,"Of lawyers, who'll in all things pry:"
106,THE BANKRUPT.,His private foibles e'en mast out--
107,THE BANKRUPT.,Grievous exposure 'tis no doubt!
108,THE BANKRUPT.,"And if he's fraudl'lent found, must go"
109,THE BANKRUPT.,To witness scenes of vice and woe;
110,THE BANKRUPT.,"Of liberty deprived, to wail"
111,THE BANKRUPT.,His faults and folly in a jail:
112,THE BANKRUPT.,"But should his conduct seem least fair,"
113,THE BANKRUPT.,England's blest laws will set him clear;
114,THE BANKRUPT.,"Not only so, but means will give"
115,THE BANKRUPT.,T'enable him again to live:
116,THE BANKRUPT.,"For such the law, that when 'tis found"
117,THE BANKRUPT.,"There's fifteen shillings in the pound,"
118,THE BANKRUPT.,"A handsome drawback he's allow'd,"
119,THE BANKRUPT.,"When, 'stead of shamed, he may look proud;"
120,THE BANKRUPT.,"And be his div'dend e'er so low,"
121,THE BANKRUPT.,They'll never let him coinless go.
122,THE BANKRUPT.,"Yes, be it e'er a Briton's pride,"
123,THE BANKRUPT.,That mercy in his courts preside.
124,THE BANKRUPT.,"But e'er he's paid, he must await"
125,THE BANKRUPT.,T'obtain a fair certificate.
126,THE BANKRUPT.,Some cases there however are
127,THE BANKRUPT.,"Which, at first view, may seem severe;"
128,THE BANKRUPT.,Suppose his creditors are ten;
129,THE BANKRUPT.,"Four sign, the rest refuse: what then?"
130,THE BANKRUPT.,If their demand exceed the four
131,THE BANKRUPT.,They'll keep the bankrupt in their pow'r;
132,THE BANKRUPT.,"And although he has all resign'd,"
133,THE BANKRUPT.,"If unproved debts remain behind,"
134,THE BANKRUPT.,Inhuman creditors then may
135,THE BANKRUPT.,"His body into prison lay,"
136,THE BANKRUPT.,"Where oft the wretch, to sooth his grief,"
137,THE BANKRUPT.,In dissipation seeks relief.
138,THE BANKRUPT.,Sometimes a parent may prevent
139,THE BANKRUPT.,Unmeaningly the law's intent;
140,THE BANKRUPT.,And merc'less creditors decline
141,THE BANKRUPT.,"The hapless debtor's deed to sign,"
142,THE BANKRUPT.,In hopes the father may one day
143,THE BANKRUPT.,The long-neglected son's debts pay.
144,THE BANKRUPT.,"The Lawyer and the Auctioneer,"
145,THE BANKRUPT.,Plunges all parties in despair;
146,THE BANKRUPT.,"When Creditors their bills do see,"
147,THE BANKRUPT.,Each sighing say nought's left for me.

168,INSOLVENT.,To liquor fly to make them less.
169,INSOLVENT.,"Many I fear from business stray,"
170,INSOLVENT.,Soon as they find they cannot pay;
171,INSOLVENT.,"Others to prisons frequent fly,"
172,INSOLVENT.,To waste their time in luxury.
173,INSOLVENT.,"Painful sensations are their doom,"
174,INSOLVENT.,When they behold a prison's gloom;
175,INSOLVENT.,"Do not suppose I mean there are,"
176,INSOLVENT.,But few in prisons that act fair.
177,INSOLVENT.,"Yes, I should hope not one in ten,"
178,INSOLVENT.,Pursue a base ungenerous plan.

194,INSOLVENT.,My son I'll see without delay.
195,INSOLVENT.,"Each brings affections sighs and tears,"
196,INSOLVENT.,With throbbing hearts and thousand fears;

206,INSOLVENT.,"Of anguish, grief, and sorrow keen;"
207,INSOLVENT.,"She gives a sigh and said adieu,"
