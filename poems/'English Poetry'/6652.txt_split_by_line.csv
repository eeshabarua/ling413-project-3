32,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
33,PREFACE.,
34,PREFACE.,
35,PREFACE.,
36,PREFACE.,"The design of the projector of this volume was, that it should"
37,PREFACE.,contain the Best of the shorter humorous poems in the literatures
38,PREFACE.,"of England and the United States, except:"
39,PREFACE.,
40,PREFACE.,"Poems so local or cotemporary in subject or allusion, as not to be"
41,PREFACE.,readily understood by the modern American reader;
42,PREFACE.,
43,PREFACE.,"Poems which, from the freedom of expression allowed in the healthy"
44,PREFACE.,"ages, can not now be read aloud in a company of men and women;"
45,PREFACE.,
46,PREFACE.,"Poems that have become perfectly familiar to every body, from their"
47,PREFACE.,incessant reproduction in school-books and newspapers; and
48,PREFACE.,
49,PREFACE.,"Poems by living American authors, who have collected their humorous"
50,PREFACE.,"pieces from the periodicals in which most of them originally appeared,"
51,PREFACE.,and given them to the world in their own names.
52,PREFACE.,
53,PREFACE.,"Holmes, Saxe, and Lowell are, therefore, only REPRESENTED in this"
54,PREFACE.,"collection. To have done more than fairly represent them, had been to"
55,PREFACE.,"infringe rights which are doubly sacred, because they are not"
56,PREFACE.,protected by law. To have done less would have deprived the reader of
57,PREFACE.,"a most convenient means of observing that, in a kind of composition"
58,PREFACE.,"confessed to be among the most difficult, our native wits are not"
59,PREFACE.,excelled by foreign.
60,PREFACE.,
61,PREFACE.,The editor expected to be embarrassed with a profusion of material for
62,PREFACE.,"his purpose. But, on a survey of the poetical literature of the two"
63,PREFACE.,"countries, it was discovered that, of really excellent humorous"
64,PREFACE.,"poetry, of the kinds universally interesting, untainted by obscenity,"
65,PREFACE.,"not marred by coarseness of language, nor obscured by remote allusion,"
66,PREFACE.,the quantity in existence is not great. It is thought that this volume
67,PREFACE.,contains a very large proportion of the best pieces that haveappeared.
68,PREFACE.,
69,PREFACE.,"An unexpected feature of the book is, that there is not a line in it"
70,PREFACE.,by a female hand. The alleged foibles of the Fair have given occasion
71,PREFACE.,"to libraries of comic verse; yet, with diligent search, no humorous"
72,PREFACE.,poems by women have been found which are of merit sufficient to give
73,PREFACE.,them claim to a place in a collection like this. That lively wit and
74,PREFACE.,"graceful gayety, that quick perception of the absurd, which ladies are"
75,PREFACE.,"continually displaying in their conversation and correspondence,"
76,PREFACE.,"never, it seems, suggest the successful epigram, or inspire happy"
77,PREFACE.,satirical verse.
78,PREFACE.,
79,PREFACE.,The reader will not be annoyed by an impertinent superfluity of notes.
80,PREFACE.,At the end of the volume may be found a list of the sources from which
81,PREFACE.,its contents have been taken. For the convenience of those who live
82,PREFACE.,"remote from biographical dictionaries, a few dates and other"
83,PREFACE.,particulars have been added to the mention of each name. For valuable
84,PREFACE.,"contributions to this portion of the volume, and for much"
85,PREFACE.,"well-directed work upon other parts of it, the reader is indebted to"
86,PREFACE.,"Mr. T. BUTLER GUNN, of this city."
87,PREFACE.,
88,PREFACE.,"There is, certainly, nothing more delightful than the fun of a man of"
89,PREFACE.,"genius. Humor, as Mr. Thackeray observes, is charming, and poetry is"
90,PREFACE.,"charming, but the blending of the two in the same composition is"
91,PREFACE.,"irresistible. There is much nonsense in this book, and some folly, and"
92,PREFACE.,a little ill-nature; but there is more wisdom than either. They who
93,PREFACE.,possess it may congratulate themselves upon having the largest
94,PREFACE.,collection ever made of the sportive effusions of genius.

931,ROBERT SOUTHEY,"We must not, Jacob, be deceived by words;"

939,ROBERT SOUTHEY,"Their profit, and not his. He hath not learned"

3189,PERCY RELIQUES,
3190,PERCY RELIQUES,"Looke yonder, good sir knight, I pray,"

3194,PERCY RELIQUES,
3195,PERCY RELIQUES,"On tip-toe peering stood the knight,"

3199,PERCY RELIQUES,
3200,PERCY RELIQUES,"O'er head and ears he plunged in,"

3203,PERCY RELIQUES,"Help, helpe, or else I'm drownded!"
3204,PERCY RELIQUES,
3205,PERCY RELIQUES,"Now, fare-you-well, sir knight, adieu!"
3206,PERCY RELIQUES,You see what conies of fooling:
3207,PERCY RELIQUES,That is the fittest place for you;
3208,PERCY RELIQUES,Your courage wanted cooling.
3209,PERCY RELIQUES,
3210,PERCY RELIQUES,"Ere many days, in her fathers park,"
3211,PERCY RELIQUES,"Just at the close of eve-a,"
3212,PERCY RELIQUES,Again she met with her angry sparke;
3213,PERCY RELIQUES,Which made this lady grieve-a.
3214,PERCY RELIQUES,
3215,PERCY RELIQUES,"False lady, here thou'rt in my powre,"
3216,PERCY RELIQUES,And no one now can hear thee:
3217,PERCY RELIQUES,And thou shalt sorely rue the hour

3219,PERCY RELIQUES,
3220,PERCY RELIQUES,"I pray, sir knight, be not so warm"
3221,PERCY RELIQUES,With a young silly maid-a:
3222,PERCY RELIQUES,"I vow and swear I thought no harm,"
3223,PERCY RELIQUES,'Twas a gentle jest I playd-a.
3224,PERCY RELIQUES,
3225,PERCY RELIQUES,"A gentle jest, in soothe he cry'd,"
3226,PERCY RELIQUES,To tumble me in and leave me!
3227,PERCY RELIQUES,What if I had in the river dy'd?--
3228,PERCY RELIQUES,That fetch will not deceive me.
3229,PERCY RELIQUES,
3230,PERCY RELIQUES,"Once more I'll pardon thee this day,"
3231,PERCY RELIQUES,Tho' injur'd out of measure;
3232,PERCY RELIQUES,But thou prepare without delay
3233,PERCY RELIQUES,To yield thee to my pleasure.
3234,PERCY RELIQUES,
3235,PERCY RELIQUES,"Well then, if I must grant your suit,"
3236,PERCY RELIQUES,"Yet think of your boots and spurs, sir"
3237,PERCY RELIQUES,"Let me pull off both spur and boot,"
3238,PERCY RELIQUES,"Or else you cannot stir, sir."
3239,PERCY RELIQUES,
3240,PERCY RELIQUES,"He set him down upon the grass,"
3241,PERCY RELIQUES,And begg'd her kind assistance:
3242,PERCY RELIQUES,"Now, smiling, thought this lovely lass,"
3243,PERCY RELIQUES,I'll make you keep your distance.
3244,PERCY RELIQUES,
3245,PERCY RELIQUES,Then pulling off his boots half-way;
3246,PERCY RELIQUES,"Sir knight, now I'm your betters:"
3247,PERCY RELIQUES,You shall not make of me your prey;
3248,PERCY RELIQUES,Sit there like a knave in fetters.
3249,PERCY RELIQUES,
3250,PERCY RELIQUES,"The knight, when she had served him soe,"
3251,PERCY RELIQUES,"He fretted, fum'd, and grumbled:"
3252,PERCY RELIQUES,"For he could neither stand nor goe,"
3253,PERCY RELIQUES,But like a cripple tumbled.
3254,PERCY RELIQUES,
3255,PERCY RELIQUES,"Farewell, sir knight, the clock strikes ten,"
3256,PERCY RELIQUES,"Yet do not move nor stir, sir:"
3257,PERCY RELIQUES,"I'll send you my father's serving men,"
3258,PERCY RELIQUES,"To pull off your boots and spurs, sir."
3259,PERCY RELIQUES,
3260,PERCY RELIQUES,"This merry jest you must excuse,"
3261,PERCY RELIQUES,You are but a stingless nettle:
3262,PERCY RELIQUES,"You'd never have stood for boots or shoes,"
3263,PERCY RELIQUES,Had you been a man of mettle.
3264,PERCY RELIQUES,
3265,PERCY RELIQUES,"All night in grievous rage he lay,"
3266,PERCY RELIQUES,Roiling upon the plain-a;
3267,PERCY RELIQUES,"Next morning a shepherd past that way,"
3268,PERCY RELIQUES,Who set him right again-a.
3269,PERCY RELIQUES,
3270,PERCY RELIQUES,"Then mounting upon his steed so tall,"
3271,PERCY RELIQUES,By hill and dale he swore-a:
3272,PERCY RELIQUES,I'll ride at once to her father's hall;
3273,PERCY RELIQUES,She shall escape no more-a.
3274,PERCY RELIQUES,
3275,PERCY RELIQUES,"I'll take her father by the beard,"
3276,PERCY RELIQUES,I'll challenge all her kindred;
3277,PERCY RELIQUES,Each dastard soul shall stand affeard;
3278,PERCY RELIQUES,My wrath shall no more be hindred.
3279,PERCY RELIQUES,
3280,PERCY RELIQUES,"He rode unto her father's house,"
3281,PERCY RELIQUES,Which every side was moated:
3282,PERCY RELIQUES,"The lady heard his furious vows,"
3283,PERCY RELIQUES,And all his vengeance noted.
3284,PERCY RELIQUES,
3285,PERCY RELIQUES,"Thought shee, sir knight, to quench your rage,"
3286,PERCY RELIQUES,Once more I will endeavour:
3287,PERCY RELIQUES,"This water shall your fury 'swage,"
3288,PERCY RELIQUES,Or else it shall burn for ever.
3289,PERCY RELIQUES,
3290,PERCY RELIQUES,"Then faining penitence and feare,"
3291,PERCY RELIQUES,She did invite a parley:
3292,PERCY RELIQUES,"Sir knight, if you'll forgive me heare,"
3293,PERCY RELIQUES,Henceforth I'll love you dearly.
3294,PERCY RELIQUES,
3295,PERCY RELIQUES,"My father he is now from home,"
3296,PERCY RELIQUES,"And I am all alone, sir:"
3297,PERCY RELIQUES,"Therefore across the water come,"
3298,PERCY RELIQUES,"And I am all your own, sir."
3299,PERCY RELIQUES,
3300,PERCY RELIQUES,"False maid, thou canst no more deceive;"
3301,PERCY RELIQUES,I scorn the treacherous bait-a;
3302,PERCY RELIQUES,"If thou would'st have me thee believe,"
3303,PERCY RELIQUES,Now open me the gate-a.
3304,PERCY RELIQUES,
3305,PERCY RELIQUES,"The bridge is drawn, the gate is barr'd,"
3306,PERCY RELIQUES,"My father he has the keys, sir;"
3307,PERCY RELIQUES,But I have for my love prepar'd
3308,PERCY RELIQUES,"A shorter way, and easier."
3309,PERCY RELIQUES,
3310,PERCY RELIQUES,Over the moate I've laid a plank
3311,PERCY RELIQUES,"Full seventeen feet in measure,"
3312,PERCY RELIQUES,"Then step across to the other bank,"
3313,PERCY RELIQUES,And there we'll take our pleasure.
3314,PERCY RELIQUES,
3315,PERCY RELIQUES,"These words she had no sooner spoke,"
3316,PERCY RELIQUES,But straight he came tripping over:
3317,PERCY RELIQUES,"The plank was saw'd, it snapping broke,"
3318,PERCY RELIQUES,And sous'd the unhappy lover.

3967,WILLIAM COWPER.,"The sprightly morn her course renewed,"
3968,WILLIAM COWPER.,"The evening gray again ensued,"

3971,WILLIAM COWPER.,"With hunger pinched, and pinched for room,"
3972,WILLIAM COWPER.,She now presaged approaching doom.
3973,WILLIAM COWPER.,"Nor slept a single wink, nor purred,"
3974,WILLIAM COWPER.,Conscious of jeopardy incurred.
3975,WILLIAM COWPER.,
3976,WILLIAM COWPER.,"That night, by chance, the poet, watching,"
3977,WILLIAM COWPER.,Heard an inexplicable scratching;
3978,WILLIAM COWPER.,"His noble heart went pit-a-pat,"
3979,WILLIAM COWPER.,"And to himself he said--""What's that?"""
3980,WILLIAM COWPER.,"He drew the curtain at his side,"
3981,WILLIAM COWPER.,"And forth he peeped, but nothing spied."
3982,WILLIAM COWPER.,"Yet, by his ear directed, guessed"
3983,WILLIAM COWPER.,Something imprisoned in the chest;
3984,WILLIAM COWPER.,"And, doubtful what, with prudent care"
3985,WILLIAM COWPER.,Resolved it should continue there.
3986,WILLIAM COWPER.,"At length a voice which well he knew,"
3987,WILLIAM COWPER.,"A long and melancholy mew,"
3988,WILLIAM COWPER.,"Saluting his poetic ears,"
3989,WILLIAM COWPER.,"Consoled him, and dispelled his fears;"
3990,WILLIAM COWPER.,"He left his bed, he trod the floor,"
3991,WILLIAM COWPER.,"He 'gan in haste the drawers explore,"
3992,WILLIAM COWPER.,"The lowest first, and without stop"
3993,WILLIAM COWPER.,The next in order to the top.
3994,WILLIAM COWPER.,"For 'tis a truth well know to most,"
3995,WILLIAM COWPER.,"That whatsoever thing is lost,"
3996,WILLIAM COWPER.,"We seek it, ere it come to light,"
3997,WILLIAM COWPER.,In every cranny but the right.
3998,WILLIAM COWPER.,"Forth skipped the cat, not now replete"

4147,PART I.,
4148,PART I.,"Their names, little friends, I am sorry to say,"
4149,PART I.,In none of my books can I find;
4150,PART I.,"But the son, if you please, we'll call Pierre,"
4151,PART I.,"What the parents were called, never mind."
4152,PART I.,
4153,PART I.,"From France they came, in which fair land"
4154,PART I.,They were people of good renown;
4155,PART I.,And they took up their lodging one night on the way
4156,PART I.,In La Calzada town.
4157,PART I.,
4158,PART I.,"Now, if poor Pilgrims they had been,"
4159,PART I.,"And had lodged in the Hospice instead of the Inn,"
4160,PART I.,"My good little women and men,"
4161,PART I.,"Why then you never would have heard,"
4162,PART I.,This tale of the Cock and the Hen.
4163,PART I.,
4164,PART I.,"For the Innkeepers they had a daughter,"
4165,PART I.,"Sad to say, who was just such another"
4166,PART I.,"As Potiphar's daughter, I think, would have been"
4167,PART I.,If she followed the ways of her mother.
4168,PART I.,
4169,PART I.,This wicked woman to our Pierre
4170,PART I.,Behaved like Potiphar's wife;
4171,PART I.,"And because she failed to win his love,"
4172,PART I.,She resolved to take his life.
4173,PART I.,
4174,PART I.,So she packed up a silver cup
4175,PART I.,In his wallet privily;
4176,PART I.,"And then, as soon as they were gone,"
4177,PART I.,She raised a hue and cry.
4178,PART I.,
4179,PART I.,"The Pilgrims were overtaken,"
4180,PART I.,"The people gathered round,"
4181,PART I.,"Their wallets were searched, and in Pierre's"
4182,PART I.,The silver cup was found.
4183,PART I.,
4184,PART I.,They dragged him before the Alcayde;
4185,PART I.,"A hasty Judge was he,"
4186,PART I.,"""The theft,"" he said, ""was plain and proved,"
4187,PART I.,"And hang'd the thief must be."""
4188,PART I.,So to the gallows our poor Pierre
4189,PART I.,Was hurried instantly.
4190,PART I.,
4191,PART I.,If I should now relate

4199,PART I.,"When to the gallows he was led,"
4200,PART I.,"""'Twas a short way to Heaven,"" he said,"
4201,PART I.,"""Though not the pleasantest."""
4202,PART I.,
4203,PART I.,And from their pilgrimage he charged
4204,PART I.,"His parents not to cease,"
4205,PART I.,"Saying that unless they promised this,"
4206,PART I.,He could not be hanged in peace.
4207,PART I.,
4208,PART I.,They promised it with heavy hearts;
4209,PART I.,"Pierre then, therewith content,"
4210,PART I.,Was hang'd: and they upon their way

4213,PART II.,PART II.
4214,PART II.,
4215,PART II.,"Four weeks they travel'd painfully,"

4218,PART II.,Did they come back again.
4219,PART II.,
4220,PART II.,"The Mother would not be withheld,"

4224,PART II.,
4225,PART II.,"Oh tale most marvelous to hear,"
4226,PART II.,Most marvelous to tell!
4227,PART II.,"Eight weeks had he been hanging there,"
4228,PART II.,And yet was alive and well!
4229,PART II.,
4230,PART II.,"""Mother,"" said he, ""I am glad you're return'd,"
4231,PART II.,It is time I should now be released:
4232,PART II.,"Though I can not complain that I'm tired,"
4233,PART II.,And my neck does not ache in the least.
4234,PART II.,
4235,PART II.,"""The Sun has not scorch'd me by day,"
4236,PART II.,The Moon has not chilled me by night;
4237,PART II.,"And the winds have but helped me to swing,"
4238,PART II.,As if in a dream of delight.
4239,PART II.,
4240,PART II.,"""Go you to the Alcayde,"
4241,PART II.,"That hasty Judge unjust,"
4242,PART II.,"Tell him Santiago has saved me,"
4243,PART II.,"And take me down he must!"""
4244,PART II.,
4245,PART II.,"Now, you must know the Alcayde,"
4246,PART II.,"Not thinking himself a great sinner,"
4247,PART II.,"Just then at table had sate down,"
4248,PART II.,About to begin his dinner.
4249,PART II.,
4250,PART II.,His knife was raised to carve
4251,PART II.,The dish before him then;
4252,PART II.,"Two roasted fowls were laid therein,"
4253,PART II.,That very morning they had been
4254,PART II.,A Cock and his faithful Hen.
4255,PART II.,
4256,PART II.,"In came the Mother, wild with joy:"
4257,PART II.,"""A miracle!"" she cried;"
4258,PART II.,But that most hasty Judge unjust
4259,PART II.,Repell'd her in his pride.
4260,PART II.,
4261,PART II.,"""Think not,"" quoth he, ""to tales like this"
4262,PART II.,That I should give belief!
4263,PART II.,Santiago never would bestow
4264,PART II.,"His miracles, full well I know,"
4265,PART II.,"On a Frenchman and a thief."""
4266,PART II.,
4267,PART II.,"And pointing to the Fowls, o'er which"
4268,PART II.,"He held his ready knife,"
4269,PART II.,"""As easily might I believe"
4270,PART II.,"These birds should come to life!"""
4271,PART II.,
4272,PART II.,The good Saint would not let him thus
4273,PART II.,The Mother's true tale withstand;
4274,PART II.,"So up rose the Fowls in the dish,"
4275,PART II.,And down dropt the knife from his hand.
4276,PART II.,
4277,PART II.,The Cock would have crow'd if he could:
4278,PART II.,To cackle the Hen had a wish;
4279,PART II.,And they both slipt about in the gravy
4280,PART II.,Before they got out of the dish.
4281,PART II.,
4282,PART II.,"And when each would have open'd its eyes,"
4283,PART II.,"For the purpose of looking about them,"
4284,PART II.,"They saw they had no eyes to open,"
4285,PART II.,And that there was no seeing without them.
4286,PART II.,
4287,PART II.,"All this was to them a great wonder,"
4288,PART II.,They stagger'd and reel'd on the table;
4289,PART II.,"And either to guess where they were,"
4290,PART II.,"Or what was their plight, or how they came there,"
4291,PART II.,Alas! they were wholly unable:
4292,PART II.,
4293,PART II.,"Because, you must know, that that morning,"
4294,PART II.,"A thing which they thought very hard,"
4295,PART II.,"The Cook had cut off their heads,"
4296,PART II.,And thrown them away in the yard.
4297,PART II.,
4298,PART II.,"The Hen would have pranked up her feathers,"
4299,PART II.,But plucking had sadly deform'd her;
4300,PART II.,"And for want of them she would have shiver'd with cold,"
4301,PART II.,If the roasting she had had not warm'd her.
4302,PART II.,
4303,PART II.,And the Cock felt exceedingly queer;
4304,PART II.,He thought it a very odd thing
4305,PART II.,"That his head and his voice were he did not know where,"
4306,PART II.,And his gizzard tuck'd under his wing.
4307,PART II.,
4308,PART II.,"The gizzard got into its place,"
4309,PART II.,But how Santiago knows best:
4310,PART II.,"And so, by the help of the Saint,"
4311,PART II.,Did the liver and all the rest.
4312,PART II.,
4313,PART II.,"The heads saw their way to the bodies,"
4314,PART II.,"In they came from the yard without check,"
4315,PART II.,"And each took its own proper station,"
4316,PART II.,To the very great joy of the neck.
4317,PART II.,
4318,PART II.,"And in flew the feathers, like snow in a shower,"
4319,PART II.,For they all became white on the way;
4320,PART II.,"And the Cock and the Hen in a trice were refledged,"
4321,PART II.,And then who so happy as they!
4322,PART II.,
4323,PART II.,"Cluck! cluck! cried the Hen right merrily then,"
4324,PART II.,"The Cock his clarion blew,"
4325,PART II.,Full glad was he to hear again
4326,PART II.,His own cock-a-doo-del-doo!

4328,PART II.,
4329,PART II.,
4330,PART III.,PART III.
4331,PART III.,
4332,PART III.,"""A miracle! a miracle!"""
4333,PART III.,"The people shouted, as they might well,"
4334,PART III.,When the news went through the town
4335,PART III.,And every child and woman and man
4336,PART III.,"Took up the cry, and away they ran"
4337,PART III.,To see Pierre taken down.
4338,PART III.,
4339,PART III.,They made a famous procession
4340,PART III.,"My good little women and men,"
4341,PART III.,Such a sight was never seen before
4342,PART III.,And I think will never again.
4343,PART III.,
4344,PART III.,"Santiago's Image, large as life,"
4345,PART III.,Went first with banners and drum and fife;
4346,PART III.,"And next, as was most meet,"
4347,PART III.,The twice-born Cock and Hen were borne
4348,PART III.,Along the thronging street.
4349,PART III.,
4350,PART III.,"Perched on a cross-pole hoisted high,"
4351,PART III.,They were raised in sight of the crowd;
4352,PART III.,"And when the people set up a cry,"
4353,PART III.,"The Hen she cluck'd in sympathy,"
4354,PART III.,And the Cock he crow'd aloud.
4355,PART III.,
4356,PART III.,And because they very well knew for why
4357,PART III.,"They were carried in such solemnity,"
4358,PART III.,And saw the Saint and his banners before 'em
4359,PART III.,"They behaved with the greatest propriety,"
4360,PART III.,And most correct decorum.
4361,PART III.,
4362,PART III.,"The Knife, which had cut off their heads that morn,"
4363,PART III.,"Still red with their innocent blood, was borne,"
4364,PART III.,The scullion boy he carried it;
4365,PART III.,"And the Skewers also made part of the show,"
4366,PART III.,With which they were truss'd for the spit.
4367,PART III.,
4368,PART III.,The Cook in triumph bore that Spit
4369,PART III.,As high as he was able;
4370,PART III.,And the Dish was display'd wherein they were laid
4371,PART III.,When they had been served at table.
4372,PART III.,
4373,PART III.,With eager faith the crowd prest round;
4374,PART III.,There was a scramble of women and men
4375,PART III.,For who should dip a finger-tip
4376,PART III.,In the blessed Gravy then.
4377,PART III.,
4378,PART III.,"Next went the Alcayde, beating his breast,"
4379,PART III.,"Crying aloud like a man distrest,"
4380,PART III.,"And amazed at the loss of his dinner,"
4381,PART III.,"""Santiago, Santiago!"
4382,PART III.,"Have mercy on me a sinner!"""
4383,PART III.,
4384,PART III.,And lifting oftentimes his hands
4385,PART III.,"Toward the Cock and Hen,"
4386,PART III.,"""Orate pro nobis!"" devoutly he cried,"
4387,PART III.,"And as devoutly the people replied,"
4388,PART III.,"Whenever he said it, ""Amen!"""
4389,PART III.,
4390,PART III.,The Father and Mother were last in the train;
4391,PART III.,"Rejoicingly they came,"
4392,PART III.,"And extoll'd, with tears of gratitude,"
4393,PART III.,Santiago's glorious name.
4394,PART III.,
4395,PART III.,"So, with all honors that might be,"
4396,PART III.,They gently unhang'd Pierre;
4397,PART III.,"No hurt or harm had he sustain'd,"
4398,PART III.,"But, to make the wonder clear,"
4399,PART III.,A deep biack halter-mark remain'd
4400,PART III.,Just under his left ear.
4401,PART III.,
4402,PART III.,
4403,PART III.,
4404,PART IV.,PART IV.
4405,PART IV.,
4406,PART IV.,"And now, my little listening dears"
4407,PART IV.,"With open mouths and open ears,"
4408,PART IV.,Like a rhymer whose only art is
4409,PART IV.,"That of telling a plain unvarnish'd tale,"
4410,PART IV.,"To let you know I must not fail,"
4411,PART IV.,What became of all the parties.
4412,PART IV.,
4413,PART IV.,Pierre went on to Compostella
4414,PART IV.,"To finish his pilgrimage,"
4415,PART IV.,"His parents went back with him joyfully,"
4416,PART IV.,"After which they returned to their own country,"
4417,PART IV.,"And there, I believe, that all the three"
4418,PART IV.,Lived to a good old age.
4419,PART IV.,
4420,PART IV.,For the gallows on which Pierre
4421,PART IV.,"So happily had swung,"
4422,PART IV.,It was resolved that never more
4423,PART IV.,On it should man be hung.
4424,PART IV.,
4425,PART IV.,"To the Church it was transplanted,"
4426,PART IV.,As ancient books declare.
4427,PART IV.,"And the people in commotion,"
4428,PART IV.,"With an uproar of devotion,"
4429,PART IV.,Set it up for a relic there.
4430,PART IV.,
4431,PART IV.,"What became of the halter I know not,"
4432,PART IV.,"Because the old books show not,"
4433,PART IV.,"But we may suppose and hope,"
4434,PART IV.,That the city presented Pierre
4435,PART IV.,With that interesting rope.
4436,PART IV.,
4437,PART IV.,"For in his family, and this"
4438,PART IV.,"The Corporation knew,"
4439,PART IV.,It rightly would be valued more
4440,PART IV.,Than any cordon bleu.
4441,PART IV.,
4442,PART IV.,The Innkeeper's wicked daughter
4443,PART IV.,"Confess'd what she had done,"
4444,PART IV.,"So they put her in a Convent,"
4445,PART IV.,And she was made a Nun.
4446,PART IV.,
4447,PART IV.,The Alcayde had been so frighten'd
4448,PART IV.,That he never ate fowls again;
4449,PART IV.,And he always pulled off his hat
4450,PART IV.,When he saw a Cock and Hen.
4451,PART IV.,Wherever he sat at table
4452,PART IV.,Not an egg might there be placed;
4453,PART IV.,"And he never even muster'd courage for a custard,"
4454,PART IV.,Though garlic tempted him to taste
4455,PART IV.,Of an omelet now and then.
4456,PART IV.,
4457,PART IV.,But always after such a transgression
4458,PART IV.,He hastened away to make confession;
4459,PART IV.,"And not till he had confess'd,"
4460,PART IV.,"And the Priest had absolved him, did he feel"
4461,PART IV.,His conscience and stomach at rest.
4462,PART IV.,
4463,PART IV.,The twice-born Birds to the Pilgrim's Church
4464,PART IV.,"As by miracle consecrated,"
4465,PART IV.,"Were given, and there unto the Saint"
4466,PART IV.,They were publicly dedicated.
4467,PART IV.,
4468,PART IV.,At their dedication the Corporation
4469,PART IV.,A fund for their keep supplied;
4470,PART IV.,"And after following the Saint and his banners,"
4471,PART IV.,"This Cock and Hen were so changed in their manners,"
4472,PART IV.,That the Priests were edified.
4473,PART IV.,
4474,PART IV.,"Gentle as any turtle-dove,"
4475,PART IV.,Saint Cock became all meekness and love;
4476,PART IV.,"Most dutiful of wives,"
4477,PART IV.,"Saint Hen she never peck'd again,"
4478,PART IV.,So they led happy lives.
4479,PART IV.,
4480,PART IV.,The ways of ordinary fowls
4481,PART IV.,You must know they had clean forsaken;
4482,PART IV.,And if every Cock and Hen in Spain
4483,PART IV.,"Had their example taken,"
4484,PART IV.,Why then--the Spaniards would have had
4485,PART IV.,No eggs to eat with bacon.
4486,PART IV.,
4487,PART IV.,"These blessed Fowls, at seven years end,"
4488,PART IV.,In the odor of sanctity died:
4489,PART IV.,They were carefully pluck'd and then
4490,PART IV.,"They were buried, side by side."
4491,PART IV.,
4492,PART IV.,And lest the fact should be forgotten
4493,PART IV.,"(Which would have been a pity),"
4494,PART IV.,"'Twas decreed, in honor of their worth,"
4495,PART IV.,"That a Cock and Hen should be borne thenceforth,"
4496,PART IV.,In the arms of that ancient City.
4497,PART IV.,
4498,PART IV.,Two eggs Saint Hen had laid--no more--
4499,PART IV.,The chickens were her delight;
4500,PART IV.,"A Cock and Hen they proved,"
4501,PART IV.,"And both, like their parents, were virtuous and white."
4502,PART IV.,
4503,PART IV.,The last act of the Holy Hen
4504,PART IV.,Was to rear this precious brood; and when
4505,PART IV.,"Saint Cock and she were dead,"
4506,PART IV.,"This couple, as the lawful heirs,"
4507,PART IV.,Succeeded in their stead.
4508,PART IV.,
4509,PART IV.,"They also lived seven years,"
4510,PART IV.,"And they laid eggs but two,"
4511,PART IV.,From which two milk-white chickens
4512,PART IV.,To Cock and Henhood grew;
4513,PART IV.,And always their posterity
4514,PART IV.,The self-same course pursue.
4515,PART IV.,
4516,PART IV.,"Not one of these eggs ever addled,"
4517,PART IV.,(With wonder be it spoken!)
4518,PART IV.,"Not one of them ever was lost,"
4519,PART IV.,Not one of them ever was broken.
4520,PART IV.,
4521,PART IV.,"Sacred they are; neither magpie nor rat,"
4522,PART IV.,"Snake, weasel, nor marten approaching them:"
4523,PART IV.,And woe to the irreverent wretch
4524,PART IV.,Who should even dream of poaching them!
4525,PART IV.,
4526,PART IV.,Thus then is this great miracle
4527,PART IV.,Continued to this day;
4528,PART IV.,"And to their Church all Pilgrims go,"
4529,PART IV.,When they are on the way;
4530,PART IV.,And some of the feathers are given them;
4531,PART IV.,For which they always pay.
4532,PART IV.,
4533,PART IV.,"No price is set upon them,"
4534,PART IV.,And this leaves all persons at ease;
4535,PART IV.,"The Poor give as much as they can,"
4536,PART IV.,The Rich as much as they please.
4537,PART IV.,
4538,PART IV.,"But that the more they give the better,"
4539,PART IV.,Is very well understood;
4540,PART IV.,"Seeing whatever is thus disposed of,"
4541,PART IV.,Is for their own souls' good;
4542,PART IV.,
4543,PART IV.,For Santiago will always
4544,PART IV.,Befriend his true believers;
4545,PART IV.,"And the money is for him, the Priests"
4546,PART IV.,Being only his receivers.
4547,PART IV.,
4548,PART IV.,"To make the miracle the more,"
4549,PART IV.,"Of these feathers there is always store,"
4550,PART IV.,And all are genuine too;
4551,PART IV.,"All of the original Cock and Hen,"
4552,PART IV.,Which the Priests will swear is true.
4553,PART IV.,
4554,PART IV.,"Thousands a thousand times told have bought them,"
4555,PART IV.,"And if myriads and tens of myriads sought them,"
4556,PART IV.,They would still find some to buy;
4557,PART IV.,"For however great were the demand,"
4558,PART IV.,So great would be the supply.
4559,PART IV.,
4560,PART IV.,"And if any of you, my small friends,"
4561,PART IV.,"Should visit those parts, I dare say"
4562,PART IV.,"You will bring away some of the feathers,"
4563,PART IV.,And think of old Robin Gray.

4639,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Then each to work with his specific fell;
4640,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The Hakim Ibrahim INSTANTER brought
4641,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"His unguent Mahazzim al Zerdukkaut,"
4642,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"While Roompot, a practitioner more wily,"

4679,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The Riots who attended in their places

4687,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
4688,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And next came forth the reverend Convocation,"

4690,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Imaum and Mollah there of every station,"
4691,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Santon, Fakir, and Calendar were seen."
4692,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Their votes were various--some advised a Mosque
4693,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"With fitting revenues should be erected,"
4694,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"With seemly gardens and with gay Kiosque,"
4695,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,To create a band of priests selected;
4696,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Others opined that through the realms a dole
4697,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Be made to holy men, whose prayers might profit"
4698,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The Sultaun's weal in body and in soul.
4699,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"But their long-headed chief, the Sheik Ul-Sofit,"
4700,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"More closely touch'd the point;--""Thy studious mood,"""
4701,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Quoth he, ""O Prince! hath thicken'd all thy blood,"
4702,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And dull'd thy brain with labor beyond measure;
4703,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Wherefore relax a space and take thy pleasure,"

4708,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"These counsels sage availed not a whit,"
4709,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And so the patient (as is not uncommon
4710,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Where grave physicians lose their time and wit)
4711,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Resolved to take advice of an old woman;
4712,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"His mother she, a dame who once was beauteous,"
4713,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And still was called so by each subject duteous.
4714,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Now whether Fatima was witch in earnest,"
4715,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Or only made believe, I can not say--"
4716,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"But she profess'd to cure disease the sternest,"
4717,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,By dint of magic amulet or lay;
4718,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And, when all other skill in vain was shown,"
4719,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,She deem'd it fitting time to use her own.
4720,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
4721,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"""Sympathia magica hath wonders done"""
4722,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"(Thus did old Fatima bespeak her son),"
4723,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"""It works upon the fibers and the pores,"

4727,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Search land and sea, and get, where'er you can,"
4728,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The inmost vesture of a happy man:
4729,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"I mean his SHIRT, my son; which, taken warm"

4731,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Bid every current of your veins rejoice,"
4732,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And your dull heart leap light as shepherd-boy's."""
4733,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Such was the counsel from his mother came;--
4734,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"I know not if she had some under-game,"
4735,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"As doctors have, who bid their patients roam"
4736,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And live abroad, when sure to die at home;"
4737,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Or if she thought, that, somehow or another,"
4738,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Queen-Regent sounded better than Queen-Mother;
4739,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"But, says the Chronicle (who will go look it?)"
4740,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,That such was her advice--the Sultaun took it.
4741,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
4742,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"All are on board--the Sultaun and his train,"
4743,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,In gilded galley prompt to plow the main.
4744,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"The old Rais was the first who question'd, ""Whither?"""

4766,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Long from her throne of domination tumbled,"
4767,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Lay, by her quondam vassals, sorely humbled,"

5141,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Its air and situation sweet and pretty;
5142,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,It matters very little--if at all--
5143,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Whether its denizens are dull or witty,"
5144,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Whether the ladies there are short or tall,"
5145,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Brunettes or blondes, only, there stands a city!--"
5146,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Perhaps 'tis also requisite to minute
5147,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"That there's a Castle, and a Cobbler in it."
5148,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5149,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"A fair Cathedral, too, the story goes,"
5150,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And kings and heroes lie entombed within her;
5151,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"There pious Saints, in marble pomp repose,"
5152,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Whose shrines are worn by knees of many a Sinner;
5153,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"There, too, full many an Aldermanic nose"
5154,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Roll'd its loud diapason after dinner;
5155,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And there stood high the holy sconce of Becket,"
5156,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,--Till four assassins came from France to crack it.
5157,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5158,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The Castle was a huge and antique mound,"
5159,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Proof against all th' artillery of the quiver,"
5160,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Ere those abominable guns were found,"
5161,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,To send cold lead through gallant warrior's liver
5162,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"It stands upon a gently rising ground,"
5163,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Sloping down gradually to the river,"

5165,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"A well-scooped, moldy Stilton cheese--but taller."
5166,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5167,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The Keep, I find, 's been sadly alter'd lately,"
5168,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And 'stead of mail-clad knights, of honor jealous,"
5169,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"In martial panoply so grand and stately,"
5170,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Its walls are rilled with money-making fellows,"

5173,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"In short, so great a change has come to pass,"

5175,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5176,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But to my tale.--Before this profanation,"
5177,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And ere its ancient glories were out short all,"
5178,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,A poor hard-working Cobbler took his station

5180,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"His birth, his parentage, and education,"
5181,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"I know but little of--a strange, odd mortal;"

5184,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5185,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nick had a wife possessed of many a charm,"

5187,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But, spite of all her piety, her arm"

5191,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"A stick, or stool, or any thing that round did lie,"
5192,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And baste her lord and master most confoundedly.
5193,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,

5211,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5212,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And so thought Nicholas, whose only trouble"
5213,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"(At least his worst) was this, his rib's propensity;"
5214,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"For sometimes from the ale-house he would hobble,"
5215,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,His senses lost in a sublime immensity
5216,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Of cogitation--then he couldn't cobble--
5217,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And then his wife would often try the density
5218,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Of his poor skull, and strike with all her might,"

5220,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5221,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Mason, meek soul, who ever hated strife,"
5222,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Of this same striking had a morbid dread,"
5223,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,He hated it like poison--or his wife--
5224,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,A vast antipathy!--but so he said--
5225,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And very often, for a quiet life,"
5226,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"On these occasions he'd sneak up to bed,"
5227,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Grope darkling in, and soon as at the door"
5228,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,He heard his lady--he'd pretend to snore.
5229,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5230,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"One night, then, ever partial to society,"
5231,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nick, with a friend (another jovial fellow),"
5232,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Went to a Club--I should have said Society--
5233,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"At the ""City Arms,"" once call'd the ""Porto Bello"""
5234,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"A Spouting party, which, though some decry it, I"
5235,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Consider no bad lounge when one is mellow;
5236,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"There they discuss the tax on salt, and leather,"
5237,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And change of ministers and change of weather.
5238,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5239,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"In short, it was a kind of British Forum,"
5240,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Like John Gale Jones', erst in Piccadilly,"
5241,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Only they managed things with more decorum,"
5242,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And the Orations were not QUITE so silly;
5243,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Far different questions, too, would come before 'em"
5244,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Not always politics, which, will ye nill ye,"
5245,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Their London prototypes were always willing,"
5246,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,To give one QUANTUM SUFF. of--for a shilling.
5247,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5248,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"It more resembled one of later date,"
5249,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And tenfold talent, as I'm told, in Bow-street,"
5250,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Where kindlier nurtured souls do congregate,"
5251,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And, though there are who deem that same a low street"
5252,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Yet, I'm assured, for frolicsome debate"
5253,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And genuine humor it's surpassed by no street,"
5254,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"When the ""Chief Baron"" enters, and assumes"
5255,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"To ""rule"" o'er mimic ""Thesigers"" and ""Broughams."""
5256,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5257,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Here they would oft forget their Rulers' faults,"
5258,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And waste in ancient lore the midnight taper,"
5259,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Inquire if Orpheus first produced the Waltz,"
5260,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,How Gas-lights differ from the Delphic Vapor.
5261,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Whether Hippocrates gave Glauber's Salts,"

5266,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"One learned gentleman, ""a sage grave man,"""

5272,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Of sheeted Specters spoke with shorten'd breath,"
5273,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And thrice he quoted ""Drelincourt on Death."""
5274,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5275,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nick, smoked, and smoked, and trembled as he heard"
5276,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The point discuss'd, and all they said upon it,"
5277,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"How frequently some murder'd man appear'd,"
5278,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,To tell his wife and children who had done it;
5279,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Or how a Miser's Ghost, with grisly beard,"
5280,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And pale lean visage, in an old Scotch bonnet,"
5281,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Wander'd about to watch his buried money!
5282,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,When all at once Nick heard the clock strike One--he
5283,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5284,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Sprang from his seat, not doubting but a lecture"
5285,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Impended from his fond and faithful She;
5286,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nor could he well to pardon him expect her,"
5287,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"For he had promised to ""be home to tea;"""
5288,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But having luckily the key o' the back door,"
5289,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"He fondly hoped that, unperceived, he"
5290,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Might creep up stairs again, pretend to doze,"
5291,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And hoax his spouse with music from his nose.
5292,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5293,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Vain fruitless hope!--The wearied sentinel
5294,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"At eve may overlook the crouching foe,"
5295,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Till, ere his hand can sound the alarum-bell,"
5296,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,He sinks beneath the unexpected blow;
5297,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Before the whiskers of Grimalkin fell,"
5298,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"When slumb'ring on her post, the mouse may go,--"
5299,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But woman, wakeful woman, 's never weary,"
5300,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"--Above all, when she waits to thump her deary."
5301,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5302,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Soon Mrs. Mason heard the well-known tread;
5303,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"She heard the key slow creaking in the door,"
5304,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Spied through the gloom obscure, toward the bed"
5305,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nick creeping soft, as oft he had crept before;"
5306,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"When, bang, she threw a something at his head,"
5307,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And Nick at once lay prostrate on the floor;
5308,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"While she exclaim'd with her indignant face on,--"
5309,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"""How dare you use your wife so, Mr. Mason?"""
5310,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5311,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Spare we to tell how fiercely she debated,"
5312,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Especially the length of her oration,--"
5313,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Spare we to tell how Nick expostulated,"
5314,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Roused by the bump into a good set passion,"
5315,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"So great, that more than once he execrated,"
5316,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Ere he crawl'd into bed in his usual fashion;
5317,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"--The Muses hate brawls; suffice it then to say,"
5318,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,He duck'd below the clothes--and there he lay:
5319,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5320,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"'Twas now the very witching time of night,"
5321,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"When church-yards groan, and graves give up their dead,"
5322,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And many a mischievous, enfranchised Sprite"
5323,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Had long since burst his bonds of stone or lead,"
5324,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And hurried off, with schoolboy-like delight,"
5325,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"To play his pranks near some poor wretch's bed,"
5326,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Sleeping, perhaps, serenely as a porpoise,"
5327,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Nor dreaming of this fiendish Habeas Corpus.
5328,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5329,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Not so our Nicholas, his meditations"
5330,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Still to the same tremendous theme recurred,"
5331,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The same dread subject of the dark narrations,"
5332,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Which, back'd with such authority, he'd heard;"
5333,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Lost in his own horrific contemplations,"
5334,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,He pondered o'er each well-remembered word;
5335,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"When at the bed's foot, close beside the post,"
5336,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,He verily believed he saw--a Ghost!
5337,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5338,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Plain and more plain the unsubstantial Sprite
5339,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,To his astonish'd gaze each moment grew;
5340,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Ghastly and gaunt, it rear'd its shadowy height,"
5341,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Of more than mortal seeming to the view,"
5342,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And round its long, thin, bony fingers drew"
5343,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"A tatter'd winding-sheet, of course ALL WHITE;--"
5344,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The moon that moment peeping through a cloud,"
5345,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Nick very plainly saw it THROUGH THE SHROUD!
5346,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5347,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And now those matted locks, which never yet"
5348,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Had yielded to the comb's unkind divorce,"
5349,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Their long-contracted amity forget,"
5350,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And spring asunder with elastic force;
5351,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nay, e'en the very cap, of texture coarse,"
5352,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Whose ruby cincture crown'd that brow of jet,"
5353,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Uprose in agony--the Gorgon's head
5354,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Was but a type of Nick's up-squatting in the bed.
5355,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5356,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,From every pore distill'd a clammy dew.
5357,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Quaked every limb,--the candle too no doubt,"
5358,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"En regle, WOULD have burnt extremely blue,"
5359,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,But Nick unluckily had put it out;
5360,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And he, though naturally bold and stout,"
5361,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"In short, was in a most tremendous stew;--"
5362,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The room was fill'd with a sulphureous smell,"
5363,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,But where that came from Mason could not tell.
5364,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5365,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"All motionless the Specter stood,--and now"
5366,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Its reverend form more clearly shone confest,"
5367,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,From the pale cheek a beard of purest snow
5368,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Descended o'er its venerable breast;
5369,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The thin gray hairs, that crown'd its furrow'd brow,"
5370,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Told of years long gone by.--An awful guest
5371,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"It stood, and with an action of command,"
5372,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Beckon'd the Cobbler with its wan right hand.
5373,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5374,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"""Whence, and what art thou, Execrable Shape?"""
5375,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nick MIGHT have cried, could he have found a tongue,"
5376,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But his distended jaws could only gape,"
5377,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And not a sound upon the welkin rung,"
5378,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,His gooseberry orbs seem'd as they would have sprung
5379,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Forth from their sockets,--like a frightened Ape"
5380,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"He sat upon his haunches, bolt upright,"
5381,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And shook, and grinn'd, and chatter'd with affright."
5382,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5383,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And still the shadowy finger, long and lean,"
5384,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Now beckon'd Nick, now pointed to the door;"
5385,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And many an ireful glance, and frown, between,"
5386,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The angry visage of the Phantom wore,"
5387,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,As if quite vexed that Nick would do no more
5388,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Than stare, without e'en asking, ""What d' ye mean?"""
5389,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Because, as we are told,--a sad old joke too,--"
5390,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Ghosts, like the ladies, ""never speak till spoke to."""
5391,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5392,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Cowards, 'tis said, in certain situations,"
5393,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Derive a sort of courage from despair,"
5394,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And then perform, from downright desperation,"
5395,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Much more than many a bolder man would dare.
5396,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nick saw the Ghost was getting in a passion,"
5397,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And therefore, groping till he found the chair,"
5398,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Seized on his awl, crept softly out of bed,"
5399,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And follow'd quaking where the Specter led.
5400,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5401,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And down the winding stair, with noiseless tread,"
5402,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The tenant of the tomb pass'd slowly on,"
5403,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Each mazy turning of the humble shed
5404,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Seem'd to his step at once familiar grown,"
5405,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,So safe and sure the labyrinth did he tread
5406,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"As though the domicile had been his own,"
5407,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Though Nick himself, in passing through the shop,"
5408,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Had almost broke his nose against the mop.
5409,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5410,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Despite its wooden bolt, with jarring sound,"
5411,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,The door upon its hinges open flew;
5412,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And forth the Spirit issued,--yet around"
5413,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"It turn'd as if its follower's fears it knew,"
5414,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And once more beckoning, pointed to the mound,"
5415,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The antique Keep, on which the bright moon threw"
5416,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"With such effulgence her mild silvery gleam,"
5417,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,The visionary form seem'd melting in her beam.
5418,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5419,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Beneath a pond'rous archway's somber shade,"
5420,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Where once the huge portcullis swung sublime,"
5421,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"'Mid ivied battlements in ruin laid,"
5422,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Sole, sad memorials of the olden time,"
5423,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The Phantom held its way,--and though afraid"
5424,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Even of the owls that sung their vesper chime,"
5425,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Pale Nicholas pursued, its steps attending,"
5426,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And wondering what on earth it all would end in.
5427,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5428,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Within the moldering fabric's deep recess
5429,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,At length they reach a court obscure and lone;
5430,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"It seemed a drear and desolate wilderness,"
5431,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,The blackened walls with ivy all o'ergrown;
5432,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The night-bird shrieked her note of wild distress,"
5433,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Disturb'd upon her solitary throne,"
5434,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"As though indignant mortal step should dare,"
5435,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"So led, at such an hour, should venture there!"
5436,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
5437,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"--The Apparition paused, and would have spoke"
5438,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Pointing to what Nick thought an iron ring,"
5439,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But then a neighboring chanticleer awoke,"
5440,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And loudly 'gan his early matins sing
5441,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And then ""it started like a guilty thing,"""
5442,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,As that shrill clarion the silence broke.
5443,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,--We know how much dead gentlefolks eschew
5444,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The appalling sound of ""Cock-a-doodle-do!"""
5445,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,

5894,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5895,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Sir Rupert the Fearless, a gallant young knight,"
5896,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Was equally ready to tipple or fight,"
5897,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Crack a crown, or a bottle,"
5898,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Cut sirloin, or throttle;"
5899,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"In brief, or as Hume says, ""to sum up the tottle,"""
5900,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Unstain'd by dishonor, unsullied by fear,"
5901,R. HARRIS BARHAM,All his neighbors pronounced him a preux chevalier.
5902,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5903,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Despite these perfections, corporeal and mental,"
5904,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"He had one slight defect, viz., a rather lean rental;"
5905,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Besides, 'tis own'd there are spots in the sun,"
5906,R. HARRIS BARHAM,So it must be confess'd that Sir Rupert had one;
5907,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Being rather unthinking,"
5908,R. HARRIS BARHAM,He'd scarce sleep a wink in
5909,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"A night, but addict himself sadly to drinking;"
5910,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And what moralists say,"
5911,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Is as naughty--to play,"
5912,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"To Rouge et Noir, Hazard, Short Whist, Ecarte;"
5913,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Till these, and a few less defensible fancies"
5914,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Brought the Knight to the end of his slender finances.
5915,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5916,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"When at length through his boozing,"
5917,R. HARRIS BARHAM,And tenants refusing
5918,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Their rents, swearing ""tunes were so bad they were losing,"""
5919,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"His steward said, ""O, sir,"
5920,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"It's some time ago, sir,"
5921,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Since aught through my hands reach'd the baker or grocer,"
5922,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And the tradesmen in general are grown great complainers."""
5923,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Sir Rupert the brave thus address'd his retainers:
5924,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5925,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""My friends, since the stock"
5926,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Of my father's old hock
5927,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Is out, with the Kurchwasser, Barsae, Moselle,"
5928,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And we're fairly reduced to the pump and the well,"
5929,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"I presume to suggest,"
5930,R. HARRIS BARHAM,We shall all find it best
5931,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"For each to shake hands with his friends ere he goes,"
5932,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Mount his horse, if he has one, and--follow his nose;"
5933,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"As to me, I opine,"
5934,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Left sans money or wine,"
5935,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"My best way is to throw myself into the Rhine,"
5936,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Where pitying trav'lers may sigh, as they cross over,"
5937,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Though he lived a roue, yet he died a philosopher."""
5938,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5939,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"The Knight, having bow'd out his friends thus politely."
5940,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Got into his skiff, the full moon shining brightly,"
5941,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"By the light of whose beam,"
5942,R. HARRIS BARHAM,He soon spied on the stream
5943,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"A dame, whose complexion was fair as new cream,"
5944,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Pretty pink silken hose
5945,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Cover'd ankles and toes,"
5946,R. HARRIS BARHAM,In other respects she was scanty of clothes;
5947,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"For, so says tradition, both written and oral,"
5948,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Her ONE garment was loop'd up with bunches of coral.
5949,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5950,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Full sweetly she sang to a sparkling guitar,"
5951,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"With silver chords stretch'd over Derbyshire spar,"
5952,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And she smiled on the Knight,"
5953,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Who, amazed at the sight,"
5954,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Soon found his astonishment merged in delight;
5955,R. HARRIS BARHAM,But the stream by degrees
5956,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Now rose up to her knees,"
5957,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Till at length it invaded her very chemise,"
5958,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"While the heavenly strain, as the wave seem'd to swallow her"
5959,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And slowly she sank, sounded fainter and hollower;"
5960,R. HARRIS BARHAM,--Jumping up in his boat
5961,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And discarding his coat,"
5962,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""Here goes,"" cried Sir Rupert, ""by jingo I'll follow her!"""
5963,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Then into the water he plunged with a souse
5964,R. HARRIS BARHAM,That was heard quite distinctly by those in the house.
5965,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5966,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Down, down, forty fathom and more from the brink,"
5967,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Sir Rupert the Fearless continues to sink,"
5968,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And, as downward he goes,"
5969,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Still the cold water flows
5970,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Through his ears, and his eyes, and his mouth, and his nose"
5971,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Till the rum and the brandy he'd swallow'd since lunch
5972,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Wanted nothing but lemon to fill him with punch;
5973,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Some minutes elapsed since he enter'd the flood,"
5974,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Ere his heels touch'd the bottom, and stuck in the mud."
5975,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5976,R. HARRIS BARHAM,But oh! what a sight
5977,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Met the eyes of the Knight,"
5978,R. HARRIS BARHAM,When he stood in the depth of the stream bolt upright!--
5979,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"A grand stalactite hall,"
5980,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Like the cave of Fingal,"
5981,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Rose above and about him;--great fishes and small
5982,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Came thronging around him, regardless of danger,"
5983,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And seem'd all agog for a peep at the stranger,"
5984,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Their figures and forms to describe, language fails--"
5985,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"They'd such very odd heads, and such very odd tails;"
5986,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Of their genus or species a sample to gain,"
5987,R. HARRIS BARHAM,You would ransack all Hungerford market in vain;
5988,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"E'en the famed Mr. Myers,"
5989,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Would scarcely find buyers,"
5990,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Though hundreds of passengers doubtless would stop
5991,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"To stare, were such monsters exposed in his shop."
5992,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
5993,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"But little reck'd Rupert these queer-looking brutes,"
5994,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Or the efts and the newts
5995,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"That crawled up his boots,"
5996,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"For a sight, beyond any of which I've made mention,"
5997,R. HARRIS BARHAM,In a moment completely absorb'd his attention.
5998,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"A huge crystal bath, which, with water far clearer"
5999,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Than George Robins' filters, or Thorpe's (which are dearer),"
6000,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Have ever distill'd,"
6001,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"To the summit was fill'd,"
6002,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Lay stretch'd out before him--and every nerve thrill'd
6003,R. HARRIS BARHAM,As scores of young women
6004,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Were diving and swimming,"
6005,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Till the vision a perfect quandary put him in;--
6006,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"All slightly accoutred in gauzes and lawns,"
6007,R. HARRIS BARHAM,They came floating about him like so many prawns.
6008,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6009,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Sir Rupert, who (barring the few peccadilloes"
6010,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Alluded to), ere he lept into the billows"
6011,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Possess'd irreproachable morals, began"
6012,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"To feel rather queer, as a modest young man;"
6013,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"When forth stepp'd a dame, whom he recognized soon"
6014,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"As the one he had seen by the light of the moon,"
6015,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And lisp'd, while a soft smile attended each sentence,"
6016,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""Sir Rupert, I'm happy to make your acquaintance;"
6017,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"My name is Lurline,"
6018,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And the ladies you've seen,"
6019,R. HARRIS BARHAM,All do me the honor to call me their Queen;
6020,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"I'm delighted to see you, sir, down in the Rhine here"
6021,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And hope you can make it convenient to dine here."""
6022,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6023,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"The Knight blush'd, and bow'd,"
6024,R. HARRIS BARHAM,As he ogled the crowd
6025,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Of subaqueous beauties, then answer'd aloud;"
6026,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""Ma'am, you do me much honor--I can not express"
6027,R. HARRIS BARHAM,The delight I shall feel--if you'll pardon my dress--
6028,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"May I venture to say, when a gentleman jumps"
6029,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"In the river at midnight for want of the 'dumps,'"
6030,R. HARRIS BARHAM,He rarely puts on his knee-breeches and pumps;
6031,R. HARRIS BARHAM,If I could but have guess'd--what I sensibly feel--
6032,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Your politeness--I'd not have come en dishabille,"
6033,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"But have put on my SILK tights in lieu of my STEEL."""
6034,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Quoth the lady, ""Dear sir, no apologies, pray,"
6035,R. HARRIS BARHAM,You will take our 'pot-luck' in the family way;
6036,R. HARRIS BARHAM,We can give you a dish
6037,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Of some decentish fish,"
6038,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And our water's thought fairish; but here in the Rhine,"
6039,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"I can't say we pique ourselves much on our wine."""
6040,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6041,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"The Knight made a bow more profound than before,"
6042,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"When a Dory-faced page oped the dining-room door,"
6043,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And said, bending his knee,"
6044,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""Madame, on a servi!"""
6045,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Rupert tender'd his arm, led Lurline to her place,"
6046,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And a fat little Mer-man stood up and said grace,"
6047,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6048,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"What boots it to tell of the viands, or how she"
6049,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Apologized much for their plain water-souchy,"
6050,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Want of Harvey's, and Cross's,"
6051,R. HARRIS BARHAM,And Burgess's sauces?
6052,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Or how Rupert, on his side, protested, by Jove, he"
6053,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Preferr'd his fish plain, without soy or anchovy."
6054,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Suffice it the meal
6055,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Boasted trout, perch, and eel,"
6056,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Besides some remarkably fine salmon peel,"
6057,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"The Knight, sooth to say, thought much less of the fishes"
6058,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Than what they were served on, the massive gold dishes;"
6059,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"While his eye, as it glanced now and then on the girls,"
6060,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Was caught by their persons much less than their pearls,"
6061,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And a thought came across him and caused him to muse,"
6062,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""If I could but get hold"
6063,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Of some of that gold,"
6064,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"I might manage to pay off my rascally Jews!"""
6065,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6066,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"When dinner was done, at a sign to the lasses,"
6067,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"The table was clear'd, and they put on fresh glasses;"
6068,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Then the lady addrest
6069,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Her redoubtable guest
6070,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Much as Dido, of old, did the pious Eneas,"
6071,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""Dear sir, what induced you to come down and see us?""--"
6072,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Rupert gave her a glance most bewitchingly tender,"
6073,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Loll'd back in his chair, put his toes on the fender,"
6074,R. HARRIS BARHAM,And told her outright
6075,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"How that he, a young Knight,"
6076,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Had never been last at a feast or a fight;
6077,R. HARRIS BARHAM,But that keeping good cheer
6078,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Every day in the year,"
6079,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And drinking neat wines all the same as small-beer,"
6080,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Had exhausted his rent,"
6081,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And, his money all spent,"
6082,R. HARRIS BARHAM,How he borrow'd large sums at two hundred per cent.;
6083,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"How they follow'd--and then,"
6084,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"The once civilest of men,"
6085,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Messrs. Howard and Gibbs, made him bitterly rue it he'd"
6086,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Ever raised money by way of annuity;
6087,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And, his mortgages being about to foreclose,"
6088,R. HARRIS BARHAM,How he jumped into the river to finish his woes!
6089,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6090,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Lurline was affected, and own'd, with a tear,"
6091,R. HARRIS BARHAM,That a story so mournful had ne'er met her ear:
6092,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Rupert, hearing her sigh,"
6093,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Look'd uncommonly sly,"
6094,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And said, with some emphasis, ""Ah! miss, had I"
6095,R. HARRIS BARHAM,A few pounds of those metals
6096,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"You waste here on kettles,"
6097,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Then, Lord once again"
6098,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Of my spacious domain,"
6099,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"A free Count of the Empire once more I might reign,"
6100,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"With Lurline at my side,"
6101,R. HARRIS BARHAM,My adorable bride
6102,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"(For the parson should come, and the knot should be tied);"
6103,R. HARRIS BARHAM,No couple so happy on earth should be seen
6104,R. HARRIS BARHAM,As Sir Rupert the brave and his charming Lurline;
6105,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Not that money's my object--No, hang it! I scorn it--"
6106,R. HARRIS BARHAM,And as for my rank--but that YOU'D so adorn it--
6107,R. HARRIS BARHAM,I'd abandon it all
6108,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"To remain your true thrall,"
6109,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And, instead of 'the GREAT,' be call'd 'Rupert the SMALL,'"
6110,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"--To gain but your smiles, were I Sardanapalus,"
6111,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"I'd descend from my throne, and be boots at an alehouse."""
6112,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6113,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Lurline hung her head
6114,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Turn'd pale, and then red,"
6115,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Growing faint at this sudden proposal to wed,"
6116,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"As though his abruptness, in ""popping the question"""
6117,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"So soon after dinner, disturb'd her digestion."
6118,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Then, averting her eye,"
6119,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"With a lover-like sigh,"
6120,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""You are welcome,"" she murmur'd in tones most bewitching,"
6121,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""To every utensil I have in my kitchen!"""
6122,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Upstarted the Knight,"
6123,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Half mad with delight,"
6124,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Round her finely-form'd waist
6125,R. HARRIS BARHAM,He immediately placed
6126,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"One arm, which the lady most closely embraced,"
6127,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Of her lily-white fingers the other made capture,"
6128,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And he press'd his adored to his bosom with rapture,"
6129,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"""And, oh!"" he exclaim'd, ""let them go catch my skiff,"
6130,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"I'll be home in a twinkling and back in a jiffy,"
6131,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Nor one moment procrastinate longer my journey

6133,R. HARRIS BARHAM,
6134,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"One kiss to her lip, and one squeeze to her hand"
6135,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And Sir Rupert already was half-way to land,"

6137,R. HARRIS BARHAM,With features would frighten
6138,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Old Nick, caught him up in one hand, though no light one,"
6139,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"Sprang up through the waves, popp'd him into his funny,"
6140,R. HARRIS BARHAM,Which some others already had half-fill'd with money;
6141,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"In fact, 'twas so heavily laden with ore"
6142,R. HARRIS BARHAM,"And pearls, 'twas a mercy he got it to shore;"

6148,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6149,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"""Away! away! to the mountain's brow,"
6150,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Where the castle is darkly frowning;
6151,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And the vassals, all in goodly row,"
6152,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Weep for their lord a-drowning!
6153,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Away! away! to the steward's room,"
6154,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Where law with its wig and robe is;
6155,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Throw us out John Doe and Richard Roe,"
6156,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And sweetly we'll tidde their tobies!"""
6157,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6158,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"The unearthly voices scarce had ceased their yelling,"
6159,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,When Rupert reach'd his old baronial dwelling.
6160,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6161,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,What rejoicing was there!
6162,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,How the vassals did stare!
6163,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"The old housekeeper put a clean shirt down to air,"
6164,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,For she saw by her lamp
6165,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"That her master's was damp,"
6166,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And she fear'd he'd catch cold, and lumbago, and cramp;"
6167,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"But, scorning what she did,"
6168,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,The Knight never heeded
6169,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Wet jacket, or trousers, or thought of repining,"
6170,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Since their pockets had got such a delicate lining.
6171,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"But, oh! what dismay"
6172,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Fill'd the tribe of Ca Sa,"
6173,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"When they found he'd the cash, and intended to pay!"
6174,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Away went ""cognovits,"" ""bills,"" ""bonds,"" and ""escheats,"""
6175,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Rupert cleared off old scores, and took proper receipts."
6176,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6177,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Now no more he sends out,"
6178,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"For pots of brown stout,"
6179,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Or schnapps, but resolves to do henceforth without,"
6180,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Abjure from this hour all excess and ebriety,"
6181,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Enroll himself one of a Temp'rance Society,"
6182,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"All riot eschew,"
6183,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Begin life anew,"
6184,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,And new-cushion and hassock the family pew!
6185,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Nay, to strengthen him more in this new mode of life"
6186,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,He boldly determined to take him a wife.
6187,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6188,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Now, many would think that the Knight, from a nice sense"
6189,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Of honor, should put Lurline's name in the license,"
6190,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And that, for a man of his breeding and quality,"
6191,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"To break faith and troth,"
6192,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Confirm'd by an oath,"
6193,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Is not quite consistent with rigid morality;
6194,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"But whether the nymph was forgot, or he thought her"
6195,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"From her essence scarce wife, but at best wife-and-water"
6196,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And declined as unsuited,"
6197,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,A bride so diluted--
6198,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Be this as it may,"
6199,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"He, I'm sorry to say"
6200,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"For, all things consider'd, I own 'twas a rum thing,"
6201,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Made proposals in form to Miss Una Von--something
6202,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"(Her name has escaped me), sole heiress, and niece"
6203,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,To a highly respectable Justice of Peace.
6204,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6205,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"""Thrice happy's the wooing"
6206,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"That's not long a-doing!"""
6207,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,So much time is saved in the billing and cooing--
6208,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"The ring is now bought, the white favors, and gloves,"
6209,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,And all the et cetera which crown people's loves;
6210,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,A magnificent bride-cake comes home from the baker.
6211,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And lastly appears, from the German Long Acre,"
6212,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"That shaft which, the sharpest in all Cupid's quiver is,"
6213,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"A plumb-color'd coach, and rich Pompadour liveries,"
6214,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6215,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,'Twas a comely sight
6216,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"To behold the Knight,"
6217,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"With his beautiful bride, dress'd all in white,"
6218,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And the bridemaids fair with their long lace vails,"
6219,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"As they all walk'd up to the altar rails,"
6220,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"While nice little boys, the incense dispensers,"
6221,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"March'd in front with white surplices, bands, and gilt censers."
6222,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6223,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"With a gracious air, and a smiling look,"
6224,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Mess John had open'd his awful book,"
6225,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,And had read so far as to ask if to wed he meant?
6226,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And if ""he knew any just cause or impediment?"""
6227,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,When from base to turret the castle shook!!!
6228,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Then came a sound of a mighty rain
6229,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Dashing against each storied pane,"
6230,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"The wind blew loud,"
6231,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,And coal-black cloud
6232,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"O'ershadow'd the church, and the party, and crowd;"
6233,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"How it could happen they could not divine,"
6234,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,The morning had been so remarkably fine!
6235,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6236,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Still the darkness increased, till it reach'd such a pass"
6237,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,That the sextoness hasten'd to turn on the gas;
6238,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"But harder it pour'd,"
6239,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And the thunder roar'd,"
6240,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,As if heaven and earth were coming together;
6241,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,None ever had witness'd such terrible weather.
6242,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Now louder it crash'd,"
6243,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And the lightning flash'd,"
6244,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Exciting the fears
6245,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Of the sweet little dears
6246,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"In the vails, as it danced on the brass chandeliers;"
6247,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"The parson ran off, though a stout-hearted Saxon,"
6248,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,When he found that a flash had set fire to his caxon.
6249,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6250,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Though all the rest trembled, as might be expected,"
6251,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Sir Rupert was perfectly cool and collected,"
6252,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,And endeavor'd to cheer
6253,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"His bride, in her ear"
6254,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Whisp'ring tenderly, ""Pray don't be frighten'd, my dear"
6255,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Should it even set fire to the castle, and burn it, you're"
6256,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Amply insured, both for buildings and furniture."""
6257,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"But now, from without,"
6258,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,A trustworthy scout
6259,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Rush'd hurriedly in--
6260,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Wet through to the skin,"
6261,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Informing his master 'the river was rising,"
6262,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,And flooding the grounds in a way quite surprising.'
6263,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6264,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"He'd no time to say more,"
6265,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,For already the roar
6266,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Of the waters was heard as they reach'd the church-door,"
6267,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"While, high on the first wave that roll'd in, was seen,"
6268,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Riding proudly, the form of the angry Lurline;"
6269,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And all might observe, by her glance fierce and stormy,"
6270,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,She was stung by the spretoe injuria formoe.
6271,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,
6272,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"What she said to the Knight, what she said to the bride,"
6273,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"What she said to the ladies who stood by her side,"
6274,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"What she said to the nice little boys in white clothes,"
6275,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Oh, nobody mentions--for nobody knows;"
6276,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"For the roof tumbled in, and the walls tumbled out,"
6277,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"And the folks tumbled down, all confusion and rout,"
6278,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"The rain kept on pouring,"
6279,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"The flood kept on roaring,"
6280,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,The billows and water-nymphs roll'd more and more in
6281,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Ere the close of the day
6282,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,All was clean wash'd away--
6283,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"One only survived who could hand down the news,"
6284,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,A little old woman that open'd the pews;
6285,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"She was borne off, but stuck,"
6286,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"By the greatest good luck,"
6287,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"In an oak-tree, and there she hung, crying and screaming,"
6288,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,And saw all the rest swallow'd up the wild stream in;
6289,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"In vain, all the week,"
6290,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Did the fishermen seek
6291,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"For the bodies, and poke in each cranny and creek;"
6292,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,In vain was their search
6293,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"After aught in the church,"
6294,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"They caught nothing but weeds, and perhaps a few perch."
6295,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,The Humane Society
6296,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,Tried a variety
6297,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,"Of methods, and brought down, to drag for the wreck, tackles"
6298,LAY OF THE NAIADS.,But they only fished up the clerk's tortoise-shell spectacles.

6323,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"As she opened the door to her husband's knock,"

6325,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"""You nasty Warmint, look at the Clock!"
6326,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Is this the way, you"
6327,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Wretch, every day you"

6334,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6335,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Winifred Pryce was tidy and clean,"
6336,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Her gown was a flower'd one, her petticoat green,"
6337,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Her buckles were bright as her milking-cans,"
6338,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Her hat was a beaver, and made like a man's;"
6339,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Her little red eyes were deep set in their socket-holes,"
6340,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Her gown-tail was turn'd up, and tuck'd through the pocket-holes;"
6341,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,A face like a ferret
6342,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Betoken'd her spirit:
6343,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"To conclude, Mrs. Pryce was not over young,"
6344,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Had very short legs, and a very long tongue."
6345,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6346,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Now David Pryce
6347,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Had one darling vice;
6348,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Remarkably partial to any thing nice,"
6349,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Nought that was good to him came amiss,"
6350,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Whether to eat, or to drink or to kiss!"
6351,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Especially ale--
6352,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,If it was not too stale
6353,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,I really believe he'd have emptied a pail;
6354,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Not that in Wales
6355,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,They talk of their Ales:
6356,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"To pronounce the word they make use of might trouble you,"
6357,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Being spelt with a C, two R's, and a W."
6358,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6359,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"That particular day,"
6360,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"As I've heard people say,"
6361,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Mr. David Pryce had been soaking his clay,"
6362,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And amusing himself with his pipe and cheroots,"
6363,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The whole afternoon at the Goat-in-Boots,"
6364,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"With a couple more soakers,"
6365,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Thoroughbred smokers,"
6366,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Both, like himself, prime singers and jokers;"
6367,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And, long after day had drawn to a close,"
6368,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And the rest of the world was wrapp'd in repose,"
6369,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"They were roaring out ""Shenkin!"" and ""Ar hydd y nos;"""
6370,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"While David himself, to a Sassenach tune,"
6371,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Sang, ""We've drunk down the Sun, boys! let's drink down the Moon!"
6372,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,What have we with day to do?

6374,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"At length, when they couldn't well drink any more,"
6375,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Old ""Goat-in-Boots"" showed them the door:"
6376,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And then came that knock,"
6377,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And the sensible shock
6378,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"David felt when his wife cried, ""Look at the Clock!"""
6379,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"For the hands stood as crooked as crooked might be,"
6380,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"The long at the Twelve, and the short at the Three!"
6381,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6382,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,That self-same clock had long been a bone
6383,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Of contention between this Darby and Joan;
6384,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And often, among their pother and rout,"
6385,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"When this otherwise amiable couple fell out,"
6386,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6387,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Pryce would drop a cool hint,"
6388,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,With an ominous squint
6389,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"At its case, of an ""Uncle"" of his, who'd a ""Spout."""
6390,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"That horrid word ""Spout"""
6391,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,No sooner came out
6392,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Than Winifred Pryce would turn her about,"
6393,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And with scorn on her lip,"
6394,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And a hand on each hip,"
6395,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"""Spout"" herself till her nose grew red at the tip,"
6396,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"""You thundering Willin,"
6397,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,I know you'd be killing

6400,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,You may sell my chemise

6403,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6404,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Mrs. Pryce's tongue ran long and ran fast,"
6405,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But patience is apt to wear out at last,"
6406,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And David Pryce in temper was quick,"
6407,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"So he stretch'd out his hand, and caught hold of a stick;"
6408,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Perhaps in its use he might mean to be lenient,"
6409,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But walking just then wasn't very convenient,"
6410,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"So he threw it, instead,"
6411,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Direct at her head;
6412,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,It knock'd off her hat;
6413,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Down she fell flat;
6414,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Her case, perhaps, was not much mended by that:"
6415,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But whatever it was,--whether rage and pain"
6416,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Produced apoplexy, or burst a vein,"
6417,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Or her tumble induced a concussion of brain,"
6418,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"I can't say for certain,--but THIS I can,"
6419,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"When sober'd by fright, to assist her he ran,"
6420,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Mrs. Winifred Pryce was dead as Queen Anne!
6421,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6422,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,The fatal catastrophe
6423,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Named in my last strophe
6424,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"As adding to grim Death's exploits such a vast trophy,"
6425,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Made a great noise; and the shocking fatality,"
6426,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Ran over, like wild-fire, the whole Principality."
6427,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And then came Mr. Ap Thomas, the Coroner,"
6428,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"With his jury to sit, some dozen or more, on her."
6429,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6430,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Mr. Pryce to commence
6431,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"His ""ingenious defense,"""
6432,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Made a ""powerful appeal"" to the jury's ""good sense,"""
6433,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"""The world he must defy"

6437,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"He ""deplored""--he was ""apt to be rather too quick;""--"
6438,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"But, really, her prating"

6460,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,
6461,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Not far from his dwelling,"
6462,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"From the vale proudly swelling,"
6463,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Rose a mountain, it's name you'll excuse me from telling"
6464,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,For the vowels made use of in Welsh are so few
6465,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"That the A and the E, the I, O, and the U,"
6466,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Have really but little or nothing to do;
6467,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"And the duty, of course, falls the heavier by far,"
6468,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"On the L, and the H, and the N, and the R,"
6469,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Its first syllable ""PEN,"""
6470,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Is pronounceable;--then
6471,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Come two LL's, and two HH's, two FF's, and an N;"

6473,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Beating all my best efforts at euphony hollow:

6477,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,Well--the moon shone bright

6481,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,With that sort of stride
6482,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,A man puts out when walking in search of a bride
6483,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Mounting higher and higher,"
6484,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"He began to perspire,"
6485,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"Till, finding his legs were beginning to tire,"
6486,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,And feeling opprest
6487,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"By a pain in his chest,"
6488,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"He paus'd, and turn'd round to take breath, and to rest;"
6489,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"A walk all up hill is apt, we know,"
6490,R. HARRIS BARHAM.,"To make one, however robust, puff and blow,"

7826,I.,I never thought my twenty pounds
7827,I.,Some rascal knave would dare to steal;
7828,I.,I gayly passed the Belgic bounds
7829,I.,"At Quievrain, twenty miles from Lille."
7830,I.,
7831,I.,"To Antwerp town I hastened post,"
7832,I.,And as I took my evening meal
7833,I.,"I felt my pouch,--my purse was lost,"
7834,I.,O Heaven! Why came I not by Lille?
7835,I.,
7836,I.,"I straightway called for ink and pen,"
7837,I.,To grandmamma I made appeal;
7838,I.,Meanwhile a load of guineas ten
7839,I.,I borrowed from a friend so leal.
7840,I.,
7841,I.,I got the cash from grandmamma
7842,I.,"(Her gentle heart my woes could feel),"
7843,I.,"But where I went, and what I saw,"
7844,I.,What matters? Here I am at Lille.
7845,I.,
7846,I.,"My heart is weary, my peace is gone,"
7847,I.,How shall I e'er my woes reveal?

7853,II.,"To stealing I can never come,"
7854,II.,"To pawn my watch I'm too genteel,"

7856,II.,"How could I pawn it, then, at Lille?"
7857,II.,
7858,II.,"""La note,"" at times the guests will say,"
7859,II.,I turn as white as cold boiled veal:

7861,II.,_I_ dare not ask the bill at Lille.
7862,II.,
7863,II.,"I dare not to the landlord say,"
7864,II.,"""Good sir, I can not pay your bill:"""
7865,II.,"He thinks I am a Lord Anglais,"
7866,II.,And is quite proud I stay at Lille.
7867,II.,
7868,II.,"He thinks I am a Lord Anglais,"
7869,II.,"Like Rothschild or Sir Robert Peel,"
7870,II.,And so he serves me every day
7871,II.,The best of meat and drink in Lille.
7872,II.,
7873,II.,Yet when he looks me in the face
7874,II.,I blush as red as cochincal;
7875,II.,"And think did he but know my case,"
7876,II.,"How changed he'd be, my host of Lille."
7877,II.,
7878,II.,"My heart is weary, my peace is gone."
7879,II.,How shall I e'er my woes reveal?

7882,II.,
7883,III.,III.
7884,III.,
7885,III.,"The sun bursts out in furious blaze,"
7886,III.,I perspirate from head to heel;
7887,III.,I'd like to hire a one-horse chaise;
7888,III.,"How can I, without cash, at Lille?"
7889,III.,
7890,III.,I pass in sunshine burning hot
7891,III.,By cafes where in beer they deal;
7892,III.,"I think how pleasant were a pot,"
7893,III.,A frothing pot of beer of Lille!
7894,III.,
7895,III.,"What is yon house with walls so thick,"
7896,III.,All girt around with guard and grille?
7897,III.,"O, gracious gods, it makes me sick,"
7898,III.,It is the PRISON-HOUSE of Lille!
7899,III.,
7900,III.,"O cursed prison strong and barred,"
7901,III.,It does my very blood congeal!
7902,III.,"I tremble as I pass the guard,"
7903,III.,And quit that ugly part of Lille.
7904,III.,
7905,III.,"The church-door beggar whines and prays,"
7906,III.,I turn away at his appeal:
7907,III.,"Ah, church-door beggar! go thy ways!"
7908,III.,You're not the poorest man in Lille.
7909,III.,
7910,III.,"My heart is weary, my peace is gone,"
7911,III.,How shall I e'er my woes reveal?

7916,IV.,
7917,IV.,"Say, shall I to yon Flemish church,"
7918,IV.,And at a Popish altar kneel?
7919,IV.,"O do not leave me in the lurch,--"
7920,IV.,I'll cry ye patron-saints of Lille!
7921,IV.,
7922,IV.,"Ye virgins dressed in satin hoops,"
7923,IV.,"Ye martyrs slain for mortal weal,"
7924,IV.,Look kindly down! before you stoops
7925,IV.,The miserablest man in Lille.
7926,IV.,
7927,IV.,And lo! as I beheld with awe
7928,IV.,A pictured saint (I swear 'tis real)
7929,IV.,"It smiled, and turned to grandmamma!--"
7930,IV.,It did! and I had hope in Lille!
7931,IV.,
7932,IV.,"'T was five o'clock, and I could eat,"
7933,IV.,"Although I could not pay, my meal;"
7934,IV.,I hasten back into the street
7935,IV.,"Where lies my inn, the best in Lille."
7936,IV.,
7937,IV.,"What see I on my table stand,--"
7938,IV.,A letter with a well-known seal?
7939,IV.,"'Tis grandmamma's! I know her hand,--"
7940,IV.,"""To Mr. M. A. Titmarsh, Lille."""
7941,IV.,
7942,IV.,"I feel a choking in my throat,"
7943,IV.,"I pant and stagger, faint and reel!"
7944,IV.,"It is--it is--a ten pound note,"
7945,IV.,And I'm no more in pawn at Lille!

8387,DEAN SWIFT,
8388,DEAN SWIFT,When beasts could speak (the learned say
8389,DEAN SWIFT,"They still can do so every day),"
8390,DEAN SWIFT,"It seems, they had religion then,"
8391,DEAN SWIFT,As much as now we find in men.
8392,DEAN SWIFT,"It happen'd, when a plague broke out"
8393,DEAN SWIFT,"(Which therefore made them more devout),"
8394,DEAN SWIFT,"The king of brutes (to make it plain,"
8395,DEAN SWIFT,Of quadrupeds I only mean)
8396,DEAN SWIFT,"By proclamation gave command,"
8397,DEAN SWIFT,That every subject in the land
8398,DEAN SWIFT,Should to the priest confess their sins;
8399,DEAN SWIFT,And thus the pious Wolf begins:
8400,DEAN SWIFT,"Good father, I must own with shame,"
8401,DEAN SWIFT,That often I have been to blame:
8402,DEAN SWIFT,"I must confess, on Friday last,"
8403,DEAN SWIFT,Wretch that I was! I broke my fast:
8404,DEAN SWIFT,But I defy the basest tongue
8405,DEAN SWIFT,To prove I did my neighbor wrong;
8406,DEAN SWIFT,"Or ever went to seek my food,"
8407,DEAN SWIFT,"By rapine, theft, or thirst of blood."
8408,DEAN SWIFT,
8409,DEAN SWIFT,"The Ass approaching next, confess'd,"
8410,DEAN SWIFT,That in his heart he loved a jest:
8411,DEAN SWIFT,"A wag he was, he needs must own,"
8412,DEAN SWIFT,And could not let a dunce alone:
8413,DEAN SWIFT,"Sometimes his friend he would not spare,"
8414,DEAN SWIFT,And might perhaps be too severe:
8415,DEAN SWIFT,"But yet the worst that could be said,"
8416,DEAN SWIFT,He was a wit both born and bred;
8417,DEAN SWIFT,"And, if it be a sin and shame,"
8418,DEAN SWIFT,Nature alone must bear the blame:
8419,DEAN SWIFT,"One fault he has, is sorry for't,"
8420,DEAN SWIFT,His ears are half a foot too short;
8421,DEAN SWIFT,"Which could he to the standard bring,"
8422,DEAN SWIFT,He'd show his face before the king:
8423,DEAN SWIFT,"Then for his voice, there's none disputes"
8424,DEAN SWIFT,That he's the nightingale of brutes.
8425,DEAN SWIFT,
8426,DEAN SWIFT,"The Swine with contrite heart allow'd,"
8427,DEAN SWIFT,His shape and beauty made him proud:
8428,DEAN SWIFT,"In diet was perhaps too nice,"
8429,DEAN SWIFT,But gluttony was ne'er his vice:
8430,DEAN SWIFT,"In every turn of life content,"
8431,DEAN SWIFT,And meekly took what fortune sent:
8432,DEAN SWIFT,"Inquire through all the parish round,"
8433,DEAN SWIFT,A better neighbor ne'er was found;
8434,DEAN SWIFT,His vigilance might some displease;
8435,DEAN SWIFT,"Tis true, he hated sloth like pease."
8436,DEAN SWIFT,
8437,DEAN SWIFT,"The mimic Ape began his chatter,"
8438,DEAN SWIFT,How evil tongues his life bespatter;
8439,DEAN SWIFT,Much of the censuring world complain'd.
8440,DEAN SWIFT,"Who said, his gravity was feign'd:"
8441,DEAN SWIFT,"Indeed, the strictness of his morals"
8442,DEAN SWIFT,Engaged him in a hundred quarrels:
8443,DEAN SWIFT,"He saw, and he was grieved to see't,"
8444,DEAN SWIFT,His zeal was sometimes indiscreet;
8445,DEAN SWIFT,He found his virtues too severe
8446,DEAN SWIFT,For our corrupted times to bear;
8447,DEAN SWIFT,Yet such a lewd licentious age
8448,DEAN SWIFT,Might well excite stoic's rage.
8449,DEAN SWIFT,
8450,DEAN SWIFT,"The Goat advanced with decent pace,"
8451,DEAN SWIFT,And first excused his youthful face;
8452,DEAN SWIFT,Forgiveness begg'd that he appear'd
8453,DEAN SWIFT,('T was Nature's fault) without a beard.
8454,DEAN SWIFT,"'Tis true, he was not much inclined"
8455,DEAN SWIFT,To fondness for the female kind:
8456,DEAN SWIFT,"Not, as his enemies object,"
8457,DEAN SWIFT,"From chance, or natural defect,"
8458,DEAN SWIFT,Not by his frigid constitution;
8459,DEAN SWIFT,But through a pious resolution:
8460,DEAN SWIFT,For he had made a holy vow
8461,DEAN SWIFT,"Of Chastity, as monks do now:"
8462,DEAN SWIFT,"Which he resolved to keep forever hence,"
8463,DEAN SWIFT,"And strictly too, as doth his reverence."
8464,DEAN SWIFT,
8465,DEAN SWIFT,"Apply the tale, and you shall find,"
8466,DEAN SWIFT,How just it suits with human kind.
8467,DEAN SWIFT,Some faults we own; but can you guess?
8468,DEAN SWIFT,"--Why, virtue's carried to excess,"
8469,DEAN SWIFT,"Wherewith our vanity endows us,"
8470,DEAN SWIFT,Though neither foe nor friend allows us.
8471,DEAN SWIFT,
8472,DEAN SWIFT,The Lawyer swears (you may rely on't)
8473,DEAN SWIFT,He never squeezed a needy client;
8474,DEAN SWIFT,"And this he makes his constant rule,"
8475,DEAN SWIFT,For which his brethren call him fool;
8476,DEAN SWIFT,"His conscience always was so nice,"
8477,DEAN SWIFT,He freely gave the poor advice;
8478,DEAN SWIFT,"By which he lost, he may affirm,"
8479,DEAN SWIFT,A hundred fees last Easter term;
8480,DEAN SWIFT,"While others of the learned robe,"
8481,DEAN SWIFT,Would break the patience of a Job.
8482,DEAN SWIFT,No pleader at the bar could match
8483,DEAN SWIFT,His diligence and quick dispatch;
8484,DEAN SWIFT,"Ne'er kept a cause, he well may boast,"
8485,DEAN SWIFT,Above a term or two at most.
8486,DEAN SWIFT,
8487,DEAN SWIFT,"The cringing Knave, who seeks a place"
8488,DEAN SWIFT,"Without success, thus tells his case."
8489,DEAN SWIFT,Why should he longer mince the matter?
8490,DEAN SWIFT,"He fail'd, because he could not flatter:"
8491,DEAN SWIFT,"He had not learn'd to turn his coat,"
8492,DEAN SWIFT,Nor for a party give his vote:
8493,DEAN SWIFT,His crime he quickly understood;
8494,DEAN SWIFT,Too zealous for the nation's good:
8495,DEAN SWIFT,"He found the ministers resent it,"
8496,DEAN SWIFT,Yet could not for his heart repent it.
8497,DEAN SWIFT,
8498,DEAN SWIFT,"The Chaplain vows, he can not fawn,"
8499,DEAN SWIFT,Though it would raise him to the lawn
8500,DEAN SWIFT,He pass'd his hours among his books;
8501,DEAN SWIFT,You find it in his meager looks:
8502,DEAN SWIFT,"He might, if he were worldly wise,"
8503,DEAN SWIFT,"Preferment get, and spare his eyes;"
8504,DEAN SWIFT,"But owns he had a stubborn spirit,"
8505,DEAN SWIFT,That made him trust alone to merit;
8506,DEAN SWIFT,Would rise by merit to promotion;
8507,DEAN SWIFT,Alas! a mere chimeric notion.
8508,DEAN SWIFT,"The Doctor, if you will believe him,"
8509,DEAN SWIFT,Confess'd a sin; (and God forgive him!)
8510,DEAN SWIFT,"Call'd up at midnight, ran to save"
8511,DEAN SWIFT,A blind old beggar from the grave:
8512,DEAN SWIFT,But see how Satan spreads his snares;
8513,DEAN SWIFT,He quite forgot to say his prayers.
8514,DEAN SWIFT,"He can not help it, for his heart,"
8515,DEAN SWIFT,Sometimes to act the parson's part:
8516,DEAN SWIFT,"Quotes from the Bible many a sentence,"
8517,DEAN SWIFT,That moves his patients to repentance;
8518,DEAN SWIFT,"And, when his medicines do no good,"
8519,DEAN SWIFT,Supports their minds with heavenly food:
8520,DEAN SWIFT,"At which, however well intended,"
8521,DEAN SWIFT,He hears the clergy are offended;
8522,DEAN SWIFT,"And grown so bold behind his back,"
8523,DEAN SWIFT,To call him hypocrite and quack.
8524,DEAN SWIFT,In his own church he keeps a seat;
8525,DEAN SWIFT,Says grace before and after meat;
8526,DEAN SWIFT,"And calls, without affecting airs,"
8527,DEAN SWIFT,"His household twice a-day to prayers,"
8528,DEAN SWIFT,"He shuns apothecaries' shops,"
8529,DEAN SWIFT,And hates to cram the sick with slops:
8530,DEAN SWIFT,He scorns to make his art a trade;
8531,DEAN SWIFT,Nor bribes my lady's favorite maid.
8532,DEAN SWIFT,"Old nurse-keepers would never hire,"
8533,DEAN SWIFT,To recommend him to the squire;
8534,DEAN SWIFT,"Which others, whom he will not name,"
8535,DEAN SWIFT,Have often practiced to their shame.
8536,DEAN SWIFT,
8537,DEAN SWIFT,"The Statesman tells you, with a sneer,"
8538,DEAN SWIFT,His fault is to be too sincere;
8539,DEAN SWIFT,"And having no sinister ends,"
8540,DEAN SWIFT,Is apt to disoblige his friends.
8541,DEAN SWIFT,"The nation's good, his master's glory,"
8542,DEAN SWIFT,"Without regard to Whig or Tory,"
8543,DEAN SWIFT,"Were all the schemes he had in view,"
8544,DEAN SWIFT,Yet he was seconded by few:
8545,DEAN SWIFT,"Though some had spread a thousand lies,"
8546,DEAN SWIFT,'T was he defeated the excise.
8547,DEAN SWIFT,"'T was known, though he had borne aspersion,"
8548,DEAN SWIFT,That standing troops were his aversion:
8549,DEAN SWIFT,"His practice was, in every station,"
8550,DEAN SWIFT,"To serve the king, and please the nation."
8551,DEAN SWIFT,Though hard to find in every case
8552,DEAN SWIFT,The fittest man to fill a place:
8553,DEAN SWIFT,"His promises he ne'er forgot,"
8554,DEAN SWIFT,But took memorials on the spot;
8555,DEAN SWIFT,"His enemies, for want of charity,"
8556,DEAN SWIFT,Said he affected popularity;
8557,DEAN SWIFT,"'Tis true, the people understood."
8558,DEAN SWIFT,That all he did was for their good;
8559,DEAN SWIFT,Their kind affections he has tried;
8560,DEAN SWIFT,No love is lost on either side.
8561,DEAN SWIFT,"He came to court with fortune clear,"
8562,DEAN SWIFT,Which now he runs out every year;
8563,DEAN SWIFT,"Must at the rate that he goes on,"
8564,DEAN SWIFT,Inevitably be undone:
8565,DEAN SWIFT,O! if his majesty would please
8566,DEAN SWIFT,"To give him but a writ of ease,"
8567,DEAN SWIFT,"Would grant him license to retire,"
8568,DEAN SWIFT,"As it has long been his desire,"
8569,DEAN SWIFT,"By fair accounts it would be found,"
8570,DEAN SWIFT,"He's poorer by ten thousand pound,"
8571,DEAN SWIFT,"He owns, and hopes it is no sin,"
8572,DEAN SWIFT,He ne'er was partial to his kin;
8573,DEAN SWIFT,"He thought it base for men in stations,"
8574,DEAN SWIFT,To crowd the court with their relations:
8575,DEAN SWIFT,"His country was his dearest mother,"
8576,DEAN SWIFT,And every virtuous man his brother;
8577,DEAN SWIFT,Through modesty or awkward shame
8578,DEAN SWIFT,"(For which he owns himself to blame),"
8579,DEAN SWIFT,"He found the wisest man he could,"
8580,DEAN SWIFT,Without respect to friends or blood;
8581,DEAN SWIFT,"Nor ever acts on private views,"
8582,DEAN SWIFT,When he has liberty to choose.
8583,DEAN SWIFT,
8584,DEAN SWIFT,"The Sharper swore he hated play,"
8585,DEAN SWIFT,Except to pass an hour away:
8586,DEAN SWIFT,"And well he might; for, to his cost,"
8587,DEAN SWIFT,By want of skill he always lost;
8588,DEAN SWIFT,"He heard there was a club of cheats,"
8589,DEAN SWIFT,Who had contrived a thousand feats;
8590,DEAN SWIFT,"Could change the stock, or cog a die,"
8591,DEAN SWIFT,And thus deceive the sharpest eye:
8592,DEAN SWIFT,"Nor wonder how his fortune sunk,"
8593,DEAN SWIFT,"His brothers fleece him when he's drunk,"
8594,DEAN SWIFT,
8595,DEAN SWIFT,"I own the moral not exact,"
8596,DEAN SWIFT,"Besides, the tale is false, in fact;"
8597,DEAN SWIFT,"And so absurd, that could I raise up,"
8598,DEAN SWIFT,"From fields Elysian, fabling Aesop,"
8599,DEAN SWIFT,"I would accuse him to his face,"
8600,DEAN SWIFT,For libeling the four-foot race.
8601,DEAN SWIFT,Creatures of every kind but ours
8602,DEAN SWIFT,"Well comprehend their natural powers,"
8603,DEAN SWIFT,"While we, whom reason ought to sway,"
8604,DEAN SWIFT,Mistake our talents every day.
8605,DEAN SWIFT,"The Ass was never known so stupid,"
8606,DEAN SWIFT,To act the part of Tray or Cupid;
8607,DEAN SWIFT,"Nor leaps upon his master's lap,"
8608,DEAN SWIFT,"There to be stroked, and fed with pap,"

9348,PETER PINDAR.,By one eternal yell--
9349,PETER PINDAR.,"The fellow cries out coarsely, ""Zounds,"

9359,PETER PINDAR.,
9360,PETER PINDAR.,My honest anger boils to view
9361,PETER PINDAR.,"A sniffling, long-faced, canting crew,"

9363,PETER PINDAR.,"Rushing, on Sundays, one and all,"
9364,PETER PINDAR.,"With desperate prayers thy head to maul,"
9365,PETER PINDAR.,And thus abuse their betters.
9366,PETER PINDAR.,

9388,PETER PINDAR.,Since truth must out--I seldom knew

9390,PETER PINDAR.,Till thou hadst won my heart--
9391,PETER PINDAR.,"So social were we both together,"
9392,PETER PINDAR.,"And beat the hoof in every weather,"
9393,PETER PINDAR.,I never wished to part.
9394,PETER PINDAR.,
9395,PETER PINDAR.,Yet when a child--good Lord! I thought
9396,PETER PINDAR.,"That thou a pair of horns hadst got,"
9397,PETER PINDAR.,With eyes like saucers staring!
9398,PETER PINDAR.,"And then a pair of ears so stout,"

9400,PETER PINDAR.,With claws beyond comparing.
9401,PETER PINDAR.,
9402,PETER PINDAR.,"Taught to avoid the paths of evil,"
9403,PETER PINDAR.,"By day I used to dread the devil,"

9407,PETER PINDAR.,And ran to chase my fright.
9408,PETER PINDAR.,
9409,PETER PINDAR.,"And every night I went to bed,"
9410,PETER PINDAR.,"I sweated with a constant dread,"
9411,PETER PINDAR.,And crept beneath the rug;
9412,PETER PINDAR.,"There panting, thought that in my sleep"

9416,PETER PINDAR.,"A haberdasher's shop is thine,"
9417,PETER PINDAR.,"With sins of all sorts, coarse and fine,"

9419,PETER PINDAR.,"Thy wares they buy, with open eyes;"
9420,PETER PINDAR.,"How cruel then, with constant cries,"
9421,PETER PINDAR.,To vilify thy trade!
9422,PETER PINDAR.,
9423,PETER PINDAR.,"To speak the truth, indeed, I'm loath--"
9424,PETER PINDAR.,"Life's deemed a mawkish dish of broth,"
9425,PETER PINDAR.,"Without thy aid, old sweeper;"
9426,PETER PINDAR.,"So mawkish, few will put it down,"
9427,PETER PINDAR.,"Even from the cottage to the crown,"
9428,PETER PINDAR.,Without thy salt and pepper.
9429,PETER PINDAR.,
9430,PETER PINDAR.,"O Satan, whatsoever geer,"
9431,PETER PINDAR.,"Thy Proteus form shall choose to wear,"
9432,PETER PINDAR.,"Black, red, or blue, or yellow;"
9433,PETER PINDAR.,"Whatever hypocrites may say,"
9434,PETER PINDAR.,They think thee (trust my honest lay)

9436,PETER PINDAR.,
9437,PETER PINDAR.,"'Tis ordered (to deaf ears, alas!)"

9440,PETER PINDAR.,A numerous band who daily make
9441,PETER PINDAR.,"An easy bridge of thy poor back,"
9442,PETER PINDAR.,And damn it when they 're over.
9443,PETER PINDAR.,
9444,PETER PINDAR.,"Why art thou, then, with cup in hand,"
9445,PETER PINDAR.,"Obsequious to a graceless band,"
9446,PETER PINDAR.,Whose souls are scarce worth taking;
9447,PETER PINDAR.,"O prince, pursue but my advice,"
9448,PETER PINDAR.,I'll teach your highness in a trice

9459,PETER PINDAR.,"There's not a man, nor maid, nor wife,"

9461,PETER PINDAR.,"If thou will chaim'em as before,"
9462,PETER PINDAR.,"To show their nose at church no more,"
9463,PETER PINDAR.,But quit their God for thee.

9497,PETER PINDAR.,

10303,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10304,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Over the hill and over the dale,"
10305,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And he went over the plain;
10306,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And backward and forward he swish'd his tail
10307,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,As a gentleman swishes a cane.
10308,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10309,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,How then was the Devil drest?
10310,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Oh, he was in his Sunday's best"

10327,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Such a twin-likeness there was in the pair

10329,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For he thought there was surely a looking-glass there,"
10330,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,But he could not see the frame.
10331,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10332,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He saw a Lawyer killing a viper,"

10336,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10337,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,An Apothecary on a white horse

10351,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Was cutting his own throat;
10352,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10353,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And Satan gave thereat his tail
10354,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,A twirl of admiration;
10355,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For he thought of his daughter War,"

10358,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Well enough, in sooth, he liked that truth."
10359,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And nothing the worse for the jest;
10360,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,But this was only a first thought

10372,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10373,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He walk'd into London leisurely,"

10375,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"But there he saw Brothers the Prophet,"
10376,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And Brothers the Prophet saw him,"
10377,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10378,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He entered a thriving bookseller's shop;
10379,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Quoth he, we are both of one college,"
10380,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For I myself sate like a Cormorant once
10381,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Upon the Tree of Knowledge.
10382,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,As he passed through Cold-Bath Fields he look'd
10383,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,At a solitary cell;
10384,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And he was well-pleased, for it gave him a hint"
10385,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For improving the prisons of Hell.
10386,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10387,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He saw a turnkey tie a thief's hands
10388,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,With a cordial tug and jerk;
10389,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Nimbly, quoth he, a man's fingers move"
10390,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When his heart is in his work.
10391,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10392,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He saw the same turnkey unfettering a man
10393,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,With little expedition;
10394,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And he chuckled to think of his dear slave-trade,"
10395,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And the long debates and delays that were made,"
10396,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Concerning its abolition.
10397,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He met one of his favorite daughters
10398,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,By an Evangelical Meeting:
10399,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And forgetting himself for joy at her sight,"
10400,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He would have accosted her outright,"
10401,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And given her a fatherly greeting.
10402,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10403,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"But she tipt him the wink, drew back, and cried,"
10404,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Avaunt! my name's Religion!
10405,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And then she turn'd to the preacher
10406,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And leer'd like a love-sick pigeon.
10407,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10408,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"A fine man and a famous Professor was he,"

10414,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10415,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"With throbs and throes, and ah's and oh's."
10416,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Far famed his flock for frightning;

10425,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10426,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Another daughter he presently met;
10427,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"With music of fife and drum,"
10428,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And a consecrated flag,"
10429,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And shout of tag and rag,"
10430,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And march of rank and file,"
10431,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Which had fill'd the crowded aisle
10432,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Of the venerable pile,"
10433,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,From church he saw her come.
10434,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10435,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He call'd her aside, and began to chide,"
10436,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For what dost thou here? said he,"

10438,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And there's work enough there for thee

10442,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And altars and dolls to dress;
10443,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And fools to coax,"
10444,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And sinners to hoax,"

10446,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And great pardons to sell      For those who pay well,"

10448,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10449,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Nay, Father, I boast, that this is my post,"

10513,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Great news! bloody news! cried a newsman;
10514,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The Devil said, Stop, let me see!"
10515,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Great news? bloody news? thought the Devil,"
10516,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The bloodier the better for me.
10517,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10518,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"So he bought the newspaper, and no news"
10519,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,At all for his money he had.
10520,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Lying varlet, thought he, thus to take in old Nick!"
10521,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"But it's some satisfaction, my lad"
10522,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To know thou art paid beforehand for the trick,"
10523,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For the sixpence I gave thee is bad.
10524,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10525,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And then it came into his head
10526,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"By oracular inspiration,"
10527,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,That what he had seen and what he had said
10528,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"In the course of this visitation,"
10529,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Would be published in the Morning Post
10530,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For all this reading nation.
10531,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10532,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Therewith in second sight he saw
10533,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The place and the manner and time,"
10534,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In which this mortal story
10535,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Would be put in immortal rhyme.
10536,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10537,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,That it would happen when two poets
10538,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Should on a time be met,"
10539,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"In the town of Nether Stowey,"
10540,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In the shire of Somerset.
10541,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10542,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,There while the one was shaving
10543,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Would he the song begin;
10544,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And the other when he heard it at breakfast,"
10545,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In ready accord join in.
10546,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10547,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"So each would help the other,"
10548,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Two heads being better than one;
10549,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And the phrase and conceit
10550,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Would in unison meet,"
10551,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And so with glee the verse flow free,"
10552,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"In ding-dong chime of sing-song rhyme,"
10553,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Till the whole were merrily done.
10554,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10555,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And because it was set to the razor,"
10556,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Not to the lute or harp,"
10557,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Therefore it was that the fancy
10558,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Should be bright, and the wit be sharp."
10559,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10560,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"But, then, said Satan to himself"
10561,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"As for that said beginner,"
10562,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Against my infernal Majesty,"
10563,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,There is no greater sinner.
10564,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10565,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He hath put me in ugly ballads
10566,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,With libelous pictures for sale;
10567,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He hath scoff'd at my hoofs and my horns,"
10568,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And has made very free with my tail.
10569,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10570,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,But this Mister Poet shall find
10571,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,I am not a safe subject for whim;
10572,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For I'll set up a School of my own,"
10573,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And my Poets shall set upon him.
10574,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10575,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He went to a coffee-house to dine,"
10576,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And there he had soy in his dish;
10577,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Having ordered some soles for his dinner,"
10578,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Because he was fond of flat fish.
10579,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10580,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"They are much to my palate, thought he,"
10581,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And now guess the reason who can,"
10582,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Why no bait should be better than place,"
10583,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When I fish for a Parliament-man.
10584,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10585,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,But the soles in the bill were ten shillings;
10586,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Tell your master, quoth he, what I say;"
10587,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"If he charges at this rate for all things,"
10588,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He must be in a pretty good way.
10589,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10590,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"But mark ye, said he to the waiter,"
10591,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"I'm a dealer myself in this line,"
10592,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And his business, between you and me,"
10593,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Nothing like so extensive as mine.
10594,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10595,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Now soles are exceedingly cheap,"
10596,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Which he will not attempt to deny,"
10597,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"When I see him at my fish-market,"
10598,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"I warrant him, by-and-by."
10599,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10600,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,As he went along the Strand
10601,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Between three in the morning and four
10602,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He observed a queer-looking person
10603,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Who staggered from Perry's door.
10604,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10605,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And he thought that all the world over
10606,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"In vain for a man you might seek,"
10607,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Who could drink more like a Trojan
10608,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Or talk more like a Greek.

10611,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"It would one day be matter of talk,"
10612,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"That with wine when smitten,"
10613,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And with wit moreover being happily bitten,"
10614,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The erudite bibber was he who had written
10615,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The story of this walk.
10616,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10617,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"A pretty mistake, quoth the Devil;"
10618,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,A pretty mistake I opine!
10619,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"I have put many ill thoughts in his mouth,"
10620,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He will never put good ones in mine.
10621,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10622,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And whoever shall say that to Porson
10623,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"These best of all verses belong,"
10624,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He is an untruth-telling whore-son,"
10625,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And so shall be call'd in the song.
10626,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10627,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And if seeking an illicit connection with fame,"
10628,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Any one else should put in a claim,"
10629,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In this comical competition;
10630,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,That excellent poem will prove
10631,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"A man-trap for such foolish ambition,"
10632,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Where the silly rogue shall be caught by the leg,"
10633,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And exposed in a second edition.
10634,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10635,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Now the morning air was cold for him
10636,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Who was used to a warm abode;
10637,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And yet he did not immediately wish,"
10638,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To set out on his homeward road,"
10639,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10640,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For he had some morning calls to make
10641,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Before he went back to Hell;
10642,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"So thought he I'll step into a gaming-house,"
10643,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And that will do as well;
10644,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,But just before he could get to the door
10645,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,A wonderful chance befell.
10646,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
10647,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For all on a sudden, in a dark place,"
10648,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He came upon General ----'s burning face;
10649,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And it struck him with such consternation,"
10650,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"That home in a hurry his way did he take,"

11630,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"I saw thee, Netley, as the sun"
11631,R. HARRIS RARHAM,Across the western wave
11632,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"Was sinking slow,"
11633,R. HARRIS RARHAM,And a golden glow
11634,R. HARRIS RARHAM,To thy roofless towers he gave;
11635,R. HARRIS RARHAM,And the ivy sheen
11636,R. HARRIS RARHAM,With its mantle of green
11637,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"That wrapt thy walls around,"
11638,R. HARRIS RARHAM,Shone lovehly bright
11639,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"In that glorious light,"
11640,R. HARRIS RARHAM,And I felt 't was holy ground.
11641,R. HARRIS RARHAM,
11642,R. HARRIS RARHAM,Then I thought of the ancient time--
11643,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"The days of thy monks of old,--"
11644,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"When to matin, and vesper, and compline chime,"

11649,R. HARRIS RARHAM,And then a vision pass'd
11650,R. HARRIS RARHAM,Across my mental eye;
11651,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And silver shrines, and shaven crowns,"
11652,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And delicate ladies, in bombazeen gowns,"
11653,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And long white vails, went by;"
11654,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"Stiff, and staid, and solemn, and sad,--"
11655,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"--But one, methought, wink'd at the Gardener-lad!"
11656,R. HARRIS RARHAM,
11657,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"Then came the Abbot, with miter and ring,"
11658,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And pastoral staff, and all that sort of thing,"
11659,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And a monk with a book, and a monk with a bell,"
11660,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And ""dear linen souls,"""
11661,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"In clean linen stoles,"
11662,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"Swinging their censers, and making a smell.--"
11663,R. HARRIS RARHAM,And see where the Choir-master walks in the rear
11664,R. HARRIS RARHAM,With front severe
11665,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And brow austere,"
11666,R. HARRIS RARHAM,Now and then pinching a little boy's ear
11667,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"When he chants the responses too late or too soon,"
11668,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"Or his Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La's not quite in tune."

11682,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"For an oven too big,--for a cellar too small!"
11683,R. HARRIS RARHAM,And mortar and bricks
11684,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"All ready to fix,"
11685,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And I said, ""Here's a Nun has been playing some tricks!--"

11688,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"And my heart grew sick, and my brow grew sad--"

11690,R. HARRIS RARHAM,Ah me! ah me!--'tis sad to think
11691,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"That maiden's eye, which was made to wink,"
11692,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"Should here be compelled to grow blear and blink,"

11701,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"--That wandering glance and furtive kiss,"
11702,R. HARRIS RARHAM,"Exceedingly naughty, and wrong, I wis,"
11703,R. HARRIS RARHAM,Should yet be considered so much amiss

11967,THOMAS HOOD.,No rum--nor gin--not even of a Monday--
11968,THOMAS HOOD.,"The Lion is not carved--or gilt--or red,"
11969,THOMAS HOOD.,And does not send out porter of a Sunday--
11970,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
11971,THOMAS HOOD.,
11972,THOMAS HOOD.,The Bear denied! the Leopard under looks!
11973,THOMAS HOOD.,As if his spots would give contagious fevers!
11974,THOMAS HOOD.,The Beaver close as hat within its box;
11975,THOMAS HOOD.,So different from other Sunday beavers!
11976,THOMAS HOOD.,The Birds invisible--the Gnaw-way Rats--
11977,THOMAS HOOD.,The Seal hermetically sealed till Monday--
11978,THOMAS HOOD.,The Monkey tribe--the Family of Cats--
11979,THOMAS HOOD.,We visit other families on Sunday--
11980,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy"
11981,THOMAS HOOD.,
11982,THOMAS HOOD.,What is the brute profanity that shocks
11983,THOMAS HOOD.,The super-sensitively serious feeling?
11984,THOMAS HOOD.,The Kangaroo--is he not orthodox
11985,THOMAS HOOD.,"To bend his legs, the way he does, in kneeling?"
11986,THOMAS HOOD.,"Was strict Sir Andrew, in his Sabbath coat,"
11987,THOMAS HOOD.,Struck all a-heap to see a Coati mundi?
11988,THOMAS HOOD.,Or did the Kentish Plumtree faint to note
11989,THOMAS HOOD.,The Pelicans presenting bills on Sunday?--
11990,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
11991,THOMAS HOOD.,
11992,THOMAS HOOD.,What feature has repulsed the serious set?
11993,THOMAS HOOD.,"What error in the bestial birth or breeding,"
11994,THOMAS HOOD.,To put their tender fancies on the fret?
11995,THOMAS HOOD.,One thing is plain--it is not in the feeding!
11996,THOMAS HOOD.,Some stiffish people think that smoking joints
11997,THOMAS HOOD.,Are carnal sins 'twixt Saturday and Monday--
11998,THOMAS HOOD.,"But then the beasts are pious on these points,"
11999,THOMAS HOOD.,For they all eat cold dinners on a Sunday--
12000,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
12001,THOMAS HOOD.,
12002,THOMAS HOOD.,"What change comes o'er the spirit of the place,"
12003,THOMAS HOOD.,As if transmuted by some spell organic?
12004,THOMAS HOOD.,Turns fell Hyena of the Ghoulish race?
12005,THOMAS HOOD.,"The Snake, pro tempore, the true Satanic?"
12006,THOMAS HOOD.,Do Irish minds--(whose theory allows
12007,THOMAS HOOD.,That now and then Good Friday falls on Monday)--
12008,THOMAS HOOD.,Do Irish minds suppose that Indian Cows
12009,THOMAS HOOD.,Are wicked Bulls of Bashan on a Sunday?--
12010,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs, Grundy?"
12011,THOMAS HOOD.,
12012,THOMAS HOOD.,"There are some moody Fellows, not a few,"
12013,THOMAS HOOD.,"Who, turned by nature with a gloomy bias,"
12014,THOMAS HOOD.,"Renounce black devils to adopt the blue,"
12015,THOMAS HOOD.,And think when they are dismal they are pious:
12016,THOMAS HOOD.,Is't possible that Pug's untimely fun
12017,THOMAS HOOD.,Has sent the brutes to Coventry till Monday?--
12018,THOMAS HOOD.,"Or perhaps some animal, no serious one,"
12019,THOMAS HOOD.,Was overheard in laughter on a Sunday--
12020,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
12021,THOMAS HOOD.,
12022,THOMAS HOOD.,What dire offense have serious Fellows found
12023,THOMAS HOOD.,To raise their spleen against the Regent's spinney?
12024,THOMAS HOOD.,"Were charitable boxes handed round,"
12025,THOMAS HOOD.,And would not Guinea Pigs subscribe their guinea?
12026,THOMAS HOOD.,"Perchance, the Demoiselle refused to molt"
12027,THOMAS HOOD.,The feathers in her head--at least till Monday;
12028,THOMAS HOOD.,"Or did the Elephant, unseemly, bolt"
12029,THOMAS HOOD.,A tract presented to be read on Sunday?--
12030,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs, Grundy?"
12031,THOMAS HOOD.,
12032,THOMAS HOOD.,At whom did Leo struggle to get loose?
12033,THOMAS HOOD.,Who mourns through Monkey-tricks his damaged clothing?
12034,THOMAS HOOD.,Who has been hissed by the Canadian Goose?
12035,THOMAS HOOD.,On whom did Llama spit in utter loathing?
12036,THOMAS HOOD.,Some Smithfield Saint did jealous feelings tell
12037,THOMAS HOOD.,"To keep the Puma out of sight till Monday,"
12038,THOMAS HOOD.,Because he preyed extempore as well
12039,THOMAS HOOD.,As certain wild Itinerants on Sunday--
12040,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
12041,THOMAS HOOD.,
12042,THOMAS HOOD.,To me it seems that in the oddest way
12043,THOMAS HOOD.,(Begging the pardon of each rigid Socius)
12044,THOMAS HOOD.,Our would-be Keepers of the Sabbath-day
12045,THOMAS HOOD.,Are like the Keepers of the brutes ferocious--
12046,THOMAS HOOD.,As soon the Tiger might expect to stalk
12047,THOMAS HOOD.,"About the grounds from Saturday till Monday,"
12048,THOMAS HOOD.,"As any harmless man to take a walk,"
12049,THOMAS HOOD.,If Saints could clap him in a cage on Sunday--
12050,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
12051,THOMAS HOOD.,
12052,THOMAS HOOD.,"In spite of all hypocrisy can spin,"
12053,THOMAS HOOD.,"As surely as I am a Christian scion,"
12054,THOMAS HOOD.,I cannot think it is a mortal sin--
12055,THOMAS HOOD.,(Unless he's loose)--to look upon a lion.
12056,THOMAS HOOD.,"I really think that one may go, perchance,"
12057,THOMAS HOOD.,"To see a bear, as guiltless as on Monday--"
12058,THOMAS HOOD.,"(That is, provided that he did not dance)--"
12059,THOMAS HOOD.,Bruin's no worse than bakin' on a Sunday--
12060,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
12061,THOMAS HOOD.,
12062,THOMAS HOOD.,"In spite of all the fanatic compiles,"
12063,THOMAS HOOD.,"I can not think the day a bit diviner,"
12064,THOMAS HOOD.,"Because no children, with forestalling smiles,"
12065,THOMAS HOOD.,"Throng, happy, to the gates of Eden Minor--"
12066,THOMAS HOOD.,"It is not plain, to my poor faith at least,"
12067,THOMAS HOOD.,"That what we christen ""Natural"" on Monday,"
12068,THOMAS HOOD.,"The wondrous history of Bird and Beast,"
12069,THOMAS HOOD.,Can be unnatural because it's Sunday--
12070,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
12071,THOMAS HOOD.,
12072,THOMAS HOOD.,Whereon is sinful fantasy to work?
12073,THOMAS HOOD.,"The Dove, the winged Columbus of man's haven?"
12074,THOMAS HOOD.,The tender Love-Bird--or the filial Stork?
12075,THOMAS HOOD.,The punctual Crane--the providential Raven?
12076,THOMAS HOOD.,The Pelican whose bosom feeds her young?
12077,THOMAS HOOD.,"Nay, must we cut from Saturday till Monday"
12078,THOMAS HOOD.,"That feathered marvel with a human tongue,"
12079,THOMAS HOOD.,Because she does not preach upon a Sunday--
12080,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy?"
12081,THOMAS HOOD.,
12082,THOMAS HOOD.,The busy Beaver--that sagacious beast!
12083,THOMAS HOOD.,The Sheep that owned an Oriental Shepherd--
12084,THOMAS HOOD.,"That Desert-ship, the Camel of the East,"
12085,THOMAS HOOD.,The horned Rhinoceros--the spotted Leopard--
12086,THOMAS HOOD.,The Creatures of the Great Creator's hand
12087,THOMAS HOOD.,Are surely sights for better days than Monday--
12088,THOMAS HOOD.,"The Elephant, although he wears no band,"
12089,THOMAS HOOD.,Has he no sermon in his trunk for Sunday?--
12090,THOMAS HOOD.,"But what is your opinion, Mrs, Grundy?"
12091,THOMAS HOOD.,
12092,THOMAS HOOD.,"What harm if men who burn the midnight-oil,"
12093,THOMAS HOOD.,"Weary of frame, and worn and wan of feature,"
12094,THOMAS HOOD.,"Seek once a week their spirits to assoil,"
12095,THOMAS HOOD.,"And snatch a glimpse of ""Animated Nature?"""
12096,THOMAS HOOD.,"Better it were if, in his best of suits,"
12097,THOMAS HOOD.,"The artisan, who goes to work on Monday,"
12098,THOMAS HOOD.,"Should spend a leisure-hour among the brutes,"
12099,THOMAS HOOD.,Than make a beast of his own self on Sunday--

12101,THOMAS HOOD.,
12102,THOMAS HOOD.,"Why, zounds! what raised so Protestant a fuss"
12103,THOMAS HOOD.,(Omit the zounds! for which I make apology)
12104,THOMAS HOOD.,"But that the Papists, like some Fellows, thus"
12105,THOMAS HOOD.,Had somehow mixed up Deus with their Theology?
12106,THOMAS HOOD.,Is Brahma's Bull--a Hindoo god at home--
12107,THOMAS HOOD.,A Papal Bull to be tied up till Monday?--
12108,THOMAS HOOD.,"Or Leo, like his namesake, Pope of Rome,"
12109,THOMAS HOOD.,That there is such a dread of them on Sunday--

12111,THOMAS HOOD.,
12112,THOMAS HOOD.,Spirit of Kant! have we not had enough
12113,THOMAS HOOD.,"To make Religion sad, and sour, and snubbish,"

12117,THOMAS HOOD.,"Shut Nero up from Saturday till Monday,"
12118,THOMAS HOOD.,And sure as fate they will deny us next
12119,THOMAS HOOD.,To see the Dandelions on a Sunday--

12691,THOMAS HOOD.,One day the dreary old King of Death
12692,THOMAS HOOD.,"Inclined for some sport with the carnal,"
12693,THOMAS HOOD.,"So he tied a pack of darts on his back,"
12694,THOMAS HOOD.,And quietly stole from his charnel.
12695,THOMAS HOOD.,
12696,THOMAS HOOD.,"His head was bald of flesh and of hair,"
12697,THOMAS HOOD.,His body was lean and lank;
12698,THOMAS HOOD.,"His joints at each stir made a crack, and the cur"
12699,THOMAS HOOD.,"Took a gnaw, by the way, at his shank."
12700,THOMAS HOOD.,
12701,THOMAS HOOD.,"And what did he do with his deadly darts,"
12702,THOMAS HOOD.,This goblin of grisly bone?
12703,THOMAS HOOD.,"He dabbled and spilled man's blood, and he killed"
12704,THOMAS HOOD.,Like a butcher that kills his own.
12705,THOMAS HOOD.,
12706,THOMAS HOOD.,The first he slaughtered it made him laugh
12707,THOMAS HOOD.,"(For the man was a coffin-maker),"
12708,THOMAS HOOD.,"To think how the mutes, and men in black suits,"
12709,THOMAS HOOD.,Would mourn for an undertaker.
12710,THOMAS HOOD.,
12711,THOMAS HOOD.,Death saw two Quakers sitting at church;
12712,THOMAS HOOD.,"Quoth he, ""We shall not differ."""
12713,THOMAS HOOD.,"And he let them alone, like figures of stone,"
12714,THOMAS HOOD.,For he could not make them stiffer.
12715,THOMAS HOOD.,
12716,THOMAS HOOD.,"He saw two duellists going to fight,"
12717,THOMAS HOOD.,In fear they could not smother;
12718,THOMAS HOOD.,And he shot one through at once--for he knew
12719,THOMAS HOOD.,They never would shoot each other.
12720,THOMAS HOOD.,
12721,THOMAS HOOD.,"He saw a watchman fast in his box,"
12722,THOMAS HOOD.,And he gave a snore infernal;
12723,THOMAS HOOD.,"Said Death, ""He may keep his breath, for his sleep"
12724,THOMAS HOOD.,"Can never be more eternal."""
12725,THOMAS HOOD.,
12726,THOMAS HOOD.,He met a coachman driving a coach
12727,THOMAS HOOD.,So slow that his fare grew sick;

12731,THOMAS HOOD.,"Death saw a tollman taking a toll,"

12736,THOMAS HOOD.,"He found an author writing his life,"
12737,THOMAS HOOD.,But he let him write no further;

12739,THOMAS HOOD.,Is jealous of all self-murther!
12740,THOMAS HOOD.,
12741,THOMAS HOOD.,"Death saw a patient that pulled out his purse,"
12742,THOMAS HOOD.,And a doctor that took the sum;

12749,THOMAS HOOD.,Is contractor for all our dust.
12750,THOMAS HOOD.,
12751,THOMAS HOOD.,"He saw a sailor mixing his grog,"
12752,THOMAS HOOD.,And he marked him out for slaughter;

12754,THOMAS HOOD.,And never on rum-and-water.
12755,THOMAS HOOD.,
12756,THOMAS HOOD.,"Death saw two players playing at cards,"
12757,THOMAS HOOD.,"But the game wasn't worth a dump,"

12798,THOMAS HOOD.,"A snappish mongrel christened Grog,--"
12799,THOMAS HOOD.,"What d'ye think of that, my cat?"
12800,THOMAS HOOD.,"What d'ye think of that, my dog?"
12801,THOMAS HOOD.,
12802,THOMAS HOOD.,"The monkey bit--the parrot screamed,"
12803,THOMAS HOOD.,"All day the sister strummed and sung,"
12804,THOMAS HOOD.,The petted maid was such a scold!
12805,THOMAS HOOD.,My Susan learned to use her tongue;
12806,THOMAS HOOD.,"Her mother had such wretched health,"
12807,THOMAS HOOD.,She sat and croaked like any frog--
12808,THOMAS HOOD.,"What d'ye think of that, my cat?"

13077,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,I fell in love with Laura Lilly.
13078,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13079,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,I saw her at a country ball;
13080,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,There when the sound of flute and fiddle

13087,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13088,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Dark was her hair, her hand was white;"

13090,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Her eyes were full of liquid light;
13091,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,I never saw a waist so slender;
13092,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Her every look, her every smile,"
13093,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Shot right and left a score of arrows;
13094,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"I thought't was Venus from her isle,"
13095,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,I wondered where she'd left her sparrows.
13096,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13097,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,She talk'd of politics or prayers;

13114,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13115,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"She was the daughter of a dean,"
13116,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Rich, fat, and rather apoplectic;"
13117,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,She had one brother just thirteen.
13118,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Whose color was extremely hectic;
13119,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Her grandmother, for many a year,"
13120,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Had fed the parish with her bounty;

13134,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Grew lovelier from her pencil's shading;
13135,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,She botanized; I envied each
13136,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Young blossom in her boudoir fading;
13137,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,She warbled Handel; it was grand--
13138,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,She made the Catalina jealous;
13139,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,She touch'd the organ; I could stand
13140,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,For hours and hours and blow the bellows.
13141,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13142,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"She kept an album, too, at home,"
13143,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Well fill'd with all an album's glories;
13144,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Paintings of butterflies and Rome,"
13145,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Patterns for trimming, Persian stories;"

13149,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,And recipes of elder water.
13150,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13151,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"And she was flatter'd, worship'd, bored,"
13152,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Her steps were watch'd, her dress was noted,"
13153,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Her poodle dog was quite adored,"
13154,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Her sayings were extremely quoted.
13155,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"She laugh'd, and every heart was glad,"
13156,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,As if the taxes were abolish'd;
13157,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"She frown'd, and every look was sad,"
13158,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,As if the opera were demolishd.
13159,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13160,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,She smil'd on many just for fun--
13161,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,I knew that there was nothing in it;
13162,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,I was the first the only one
13163,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Her heart thought of for a minute;
13164,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"I knew it, for she told me so,"
13165,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,In phrase which was divinely molded;
13166,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"She wrote a charming hand, and oh!"
13167,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,How sweetly all her notes were folded!
13168,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,
13169,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,Our love was like most other loves--
13170,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"A little glow, a little shiver;"

13172,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"And ""Fly Not Yet,"" upon the river;"
13173,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Some jealousy of some one's heir,"
13174,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"Some hopes of dying broken-hearted,"
13175,W. MACKWORTH PRAED.,"A miniature, a lock of hair,"

14910,DEAN SWIFT,"For both were frighten'd to the heart,"
14911,DEAN SWIFT,"And just began to cry, ""What ar't!"""
14912,DEAN SWIFT,"Then softly turn'd aside, to view"
14913,DEAN SWIFT,Whether the lights were burning blue
14914,DEAN SWIFT,"The gentle pilgrims, soon aware on't,"
14915,DEAN SWIFT,Told them their calling and their errand:
14916,DEAN SWIFT,"""Good folks, you need not be afraid,"
14917,DEAN SWIFT,"We are but saints,"" the hermits said;"

14925,DEAN SWIFT,"They scarce had spoke, when fair and soft,"
14926,DEAN SWIFT,The roof began to mount aloft;
14927,DEAN SWIFT,Aloft rose every beam and rafter;
14928,DEAN SWIFT,The heavy wall climb'd slowly after.

14930,DEAN SWIFT,"The chimney widen'd, and grew higher,"
14931,DEAN SWIFT,Became a steeple with a spire.
14932,DEAN SWIFT,
14933,DEAN SWIFT,"The kettle to the top was hoist,"
14934,DEAN SWIFT,"And there stood fasten'd to a joist,"
14935,DEAN SWIFT,"But with the upside down, to show"
14936,DEAN SWIFT,Its inclination for below:
14937,DEAN SWIFT,In vain; for a superior force

14941,DEAN SWIFT,
14942,DEAN SWIFT,"A wooden jack, which had almost"
14943,DEAN SWIFT,"Lost by disuse the art to roast,"
14944,DEAN SWIFT,"A sudden alteration feels,"
14945,DEAN SWIFT,Increased by new intestine wheels;
14946,DEAN SWIFT,"And, what exalts the wonder more,"
14947,DEAN SWIFT,The number made the motion slower.
14948,DEAN SWIFT,"The flier, though it had leaden feet,"
14949,DEAN SWIFT,Turn'd round so quick you scarce could see't;
14950,DEAN SWIFT,"But, slacken'd by some secret power,"
14951,DEAN SWIFT,Now hardly moves an inch an hour.
14952,DEAN SWIFT,"The jack and chimney, near allied,"
14953,DEAN SWIFT,Had never left each other's side;
14954,DEAN SWIFT,"The chimney to a steeple grown,"
14955,DEAN SWIFT,The jack would not be left alone;
14956,DEAN SWIFT,"But, up against the steeple rear'd,"
14957,DEAN SWIFT,"Became a clock, and still adhered;"
14958,DEAN SWIFT,"And still its love to household cares,"
14959,DEAN SWIFT,"By a shrill voice at noon, declares,"
14960,DEAN SWIFT,Warning the cook-maid not to burn
14961,DEAN SWIFT,"That roast meat, which it can not turn."
14962,DEAN SWIFT,
14963,DEAN SWIFT,"The groaning-chair began to crawl,"
14964,DEAN SWIFT,"Like a huge snail, along the wall;"

14966,DEAN SWIFT,"And with small change, a pulpit grew."
14967,DEAN SWIFT,
14968,DEAN SWIFT,"The porringers, that in a row"
14969,DEAN SWIFT,"Hung high, and made a glittering show,"

14981,DEAN SWIFT,
14982,DEAN SWIFT,"A bedstead of the antique mode,"
14983,DEAN SWIFT,"Compact of timber many a load,"
14984,DEAN SWIFT,"Such as our ancestors did use,"
14985,DEAN SWIFT,Was metamorphosed into pews;
14986,DEAN SWIFT,Which still their ancient nature keep
14987,DEAN SWIFT,By lodging folks disposed to sleep.
14988,DEAN SWIFT,
14989,DEAN SWIFT,"The cottage, by such feats as these,"
14990,DEAN SWIFT,"Grown to a church by just degrees,"
14991,DEAN SWIFT,The hermits then desired their host
14992,DEAN SWIFT,To ask for what he fancied most
14993,DEAN SWIFT,"Philemon, having paused a while,"
14994,DEAN SWIFT,Return'd them thanks in homely style;
14995,DEAN SWIFT,"Then said, ""My house is grown so fine,"

15001,DEAN SWIFT,His grazier's coat fall down his heels:
15002,DEAN SWIFT,"He sees, yet hardly can believe,"
15003,DEAN SWIFT,About each arm a pudding sleeve;
15004,DEAN SWIFT,"His waistcoat to a cassock grew,"
15005,DEAN SWIFT,And both assumed a sable hue;
15006,DEAN SWIFT,"But, being old, continued just"
15007,DEAN SWIFT,"As threadbare, and as full of dust."
15008,DEAN SWIFT,His talk was now of tithes and dues:
15009,DEAN SWIFT,"He smoked his pipe, and read the news;"
15010,DEAN SWIFT,"Knew how to preach old sermons next,"
15011,DEAN SWIFT,Vamp'd in the preface and the text;
15012,DEAN SWIFT,"At christenings well could act his part,"
15013,DEAN SWIFT,And had the service all by heart;
15014,DEAN SWIFT,"Wish'd women might have children fast,"
15015,DEAN SWIFT,And thought whose sow had farrow'd last;
15016,DEAN SWIFT,"Against dissenters would repine,"
15017,DEAN SWIFT,"And stood up firm for ""right divine;"""
15018,DEAN SWIFT,Found his head fill'd with many a system;

15020,DEAN SWIFT,
15021,DEAN SWIFT,"Thus having furbish'd up a parson,"

15023,DEAN SWIFT,"Instead of homespun coifs, were seen"
15024,DEAN SWIFT,Good pinners edged with colberteen;
15025,DEAN SWIFT,"Her petticoat transform'd apace,"
15026,DEAN SWIFT,"Became black satin, flounced with lace."

15028,DEAN SWIFT,"'T was ""Madam,"" in her grogram gown."
15029,DEAN SWIFT,"Philemon was in great surprise,"
15030,DEAN SWIFT,And hardly could believe his eyes.
15031,DEAN SWIFT,"Amazed to see her look so prim,"
15032,DEAN SWIFT,And she admired as much at him.
15033,DEAN SWIFT,
15034,DEAN SWIFT,"Thus happy in their change of life,"
15035,DEAN SWIFT,Were several years this man and wife:
15036,DEAN SWIFT,"When on a day, which proved their last,"
15037,DEAN SWIFT,"Discoursing o'er old stories past,"
15038,DEAN SWIFT,"They went by chance, amid their talk,"
15039,DEAN SWIFT,To the church-yard to take a walk;
15040,DEAN SWIFT,"When Baucis hastily cried out,"
15041,DEAN SWIFT,"""My dear, I see your forehead sprout!""--"
15042,DEAN SWIFT,"""Sprout,"" quoth the man; ""what's this you tell us?"
15043,DEAN SWIFT,I hope you don't believe me jealous!
15044,DEAN SWIFT,"But yet, methinks I feel it true,"
15045,DEAN SWIFT,And really yours is budding too--
15046,DEAN SWIFT,Nay--now I can not stir my foot;
15047,DEAN SWIFT,"It feels as if 't were taking root."""
15048,DEAN SWIFT,
15049,DEAN SWIFT,"Description would but tire my Muse,"
15050,DEAN SWIFT,"In short, they both were turn'd to yews."
15051,DEAN SWIFT,Old Goodman Dobson of the green
15052,DEAN SWIFT,Remembers he the trees has seen;
15053,DEAN SWIFT,"He'll talk of them from noon till night,"
15054,DEAN SWIFT,And goes with folks to show the sight;
15055,DEAN SWIFT,"On Sundays, after evening prayer,"
15056,DEAN SWIFT,He gathers all the parish there;
15057,DEAN SWIFT,"Points out the place of either yew,"
15058,DEAN SWIFT,"Here Baucis, there Philemon, grew:"
15059,DEAN SWIFT,"Till once a parson of our town,"
15060,DEAN SWIFT,"To mend his barn, cut Baucis down;"
15061,DEAN SWIFT,"At which, 'tis hard to be believed"
15062,DEAN SWIFT,"How much the other tree was grieved,"
15063,DEAN SWIFT,"Grew scrubbed, died a-top, was stunted,"
15064,DEAN SWIFT,So the next parson stubb'd and burnt it.

15273,PETER PINDAR.,"And Thomas, if thou'lt swear thou art not humming,"
15274,PETER PINDAR.,I'll take my spying-glass and bring thee word
15275,PETER PINDAR.,The instant I behold it coming.
15276,PETER PINDAR.,"But, Thomas Warton, without joking,"
15277,PETER PINDAR.,"Art thou, or art thou not, thy sovereign smoking?"
15278,PETER PINDAR.,
15279,PETER PINDAR.,"How canst thou seriously declare,"
15280,PETER PINDAR.,That George the Third
15281,PETER PINDAR.,"With Cressy's Edward can compare,"
15282,PETER PINDAR.,"Or Harry?--'Tis too bad, upon my word:"
15283,PETER PINDAR.,"George is a clever king, I needs must own,"
15284,PETER PINDAR.,And cuts a jolly figure on the throne.
15285,PETER PINDAR.,
15286,PETER PINDAR.,"Now thou exclaim'st, ""God rot it! Peter, pray"
15287,PETER PINDAR.,"What to the devil shall I sing or say?"""
15288,PETER PINDAR.,
15289,PETER PINDAR.,"I'll tell thee what to say, O tuneful Tom:"
15290,PETER PINDAR.,"Sing how a monarch, when his son was dying,"
15291,PETER PINDAR.,"His gracious eyes and ears was edifying,"
15292,PETER PINDAR.,By abbey company and kettle drum:
15293,PETER PINDAR.,"Leaving that son to death and the physician,"
15294,PETER PINDAR.,Between two fires-a forlorn-hope condition;
15295,PETER PINDAR.,"Two poachers, who make man their game,"
15296,PETER PINDAR.,"And, special marksmen! seldom miss their aim."
15297,PETER PINDAR.,
15298,PETER PINDAR.,"Say, though the monarch did not see his son,"
15299,PETER PINDAR.,He kept aloof through fatherly affection;
15300,PETER PINDAR.,"Determined nothing should be done,"
15301,PETER PINDAR.,"To bring on useless tears, and dismal recollection."
15302,PETER PINDAR.,"For what can tears avail, and piteous sighs?"
15303,PETER PINDAR.,Death heeds not howls nor dripping eyes;
15304,PETER PINDAR.,"And what are sighs and tears but wind and water,"
15305,PETER PINDAR.,That show the leakiness of feeble nature?
15306,PETER PINDAR.,
15307,PETER PINDAR.,"Tom, with my simile thou wilt not quarrel;"
15308,PETER PINDAR.,"Like air and any sort of drink,"
15309,PETER PINDAR.,"Whizzing and oozing through each chink,"
15310,PETER PINDAR.,That proves the weakness of the barrel.
15311,PETER PINDAR.,
15312,PETER PINDAR.,"Say--for the prince, when wet was every eye,"
15313,PETER PINDAR.,And thousands poured to heaven the pitying sigh Devout;
15314,PETER PINDAR.,"Say how a King, unable to dissemble,"
15315,PETER PINDAR.,"Ordered Dame Siddons to his house, and Kemble, To spout:"
15316,PETER PINDAR.,
15317,PETER PINDAR.,"Gave them ice creams and wines, so dear!"
15318,PETER PINDAR.,Denied till then a thimble full of beer;
15319,PETER PINDAR.,"For which they've thanked the author of this meter,"
15320,PETER PINDAR.,"Videlicet, the moral mender, Peter"
15321,PETER PINDAR.,"Who, in his Ode on Ode, did dare exclaim,"
15322,PETER PINDAR.,"And call such royal avarice, a shame."
15323,PETER PINDAR.,
15324,PETER PINDAR.,Say--but I'll teach thee how to make an ode;
15325,PETER PINDAR.,"Thus shall thy labors visit fame's abode,"
15326,PETER PINDAR.,In company with my immortal lay;
15327,PETER PINDAR.,"And look, Tom--thus I fire away--"
15328,PETER PINDAR.,
15329,PETER PINDAR.,
15330,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,BIRTH-DAY ODE.
15331,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15332,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"This day, this very day, gave birth,"
15333,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Not to the brightest monarch upon earth,"
15334,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Because there are some brighter and as big;
15335,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Who love the arts that man exalt to heaven,"
15336,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"George loves them also, when they're given"
15337,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To four-legged Gentry, christened dog and pig.*"
15338,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Whose deeds in this our wonder-hunting nation
15339,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Prove what a charming thing is education.
15340,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,*[Footnote: The dancing dogs and wise pig have formed a considerable
15341,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,part of the royal amusement.]
15342,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15343,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Full of the art of brewing beer,"
15344,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,The monarch heard of Mr. Whitbread's fame:
15345,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Quoth he unto the queen ""My dear, my dear,"
15346,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Whitbread hath got a marvelous great name;
15347,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Charly, we must, must, must see Whitbread brew--"
15348,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Rich as us, Charly, richer than a Jew:"
15349,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Shame, shame, we have not yet his brewhouse seen!"""
15350,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Thus sweetly said the king unto the queen!
15351,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15352,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Red-hot with novelty's delightful rage,"
15353,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To Mr. Whitbread forth he sent a page,"
15354,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To say that majesty proposed to view,"
15355,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"With thirst of wondrous knowledge deep inflamed,"
15356,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"His vats, and tubs, and hops, and hogsheads famed,"
15357,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,And learn the noble secret how to brew.
15358,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15359,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Of such undreamt-of honor proud,"
15360,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Meet reverently the brewer bowed;
15361,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"So humbly (so the humble story goes,)"
15362,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,He touched even terra firma with his nose;
15363,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15364,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Then said unto the page, hight Billy Ramus,"
15365,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"""Happy are we that our great king should name us,"
15366,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"As worthy unto majesty to show,"
15367,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"How we poor Chiswell people brew."""
15368,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15369,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Away sprung Billy Ramus quick as thought,"
15370,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To majesty tha welcome tidings brought,"
15371,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"How Whitbread, staring, stood like any stake,"
15372,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,And trembled--then the civil things he said--
15373,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,On which the king did smile and nod his head:
15374,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,For monarchs like to see their subjects quake:
15375,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15376,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Such horrors unto kings most pleasant are,"
15377,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Proclaiming reverence and humility:
15378,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"High thoughts, too, all those shaking fits declare"
15379,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Of kingly grandeur and great capability!
15380,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15381,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"People of worship, wealth, and birth,"
15382,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Look on the humbler sons of earth,"
15383,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Indeed in a most humble light, God knows!"
15384,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"High stations are like Dover's towering cliffs,"
15385,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Where ships below appear like little skiffs,"
15386,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,While people walking on the strand like crows.
15387,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15388,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Muse, sing the stir that Mr. Whitbread made;"
15389,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Poor gentleman! most terribly afraid
15390,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,He should not charm enough his guests divine:
15391,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"He gave his maids new aprons, gowns and smocks;"
15392,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"And lo! two hundred pounds were spent in frocks,"
15393,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,To make the apprentices and draymen fine:
15394,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15395,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Busy as horses in a field of clover,"
15396,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Dogs, cats, and chairs, and stools, were tumbled over,"
15397,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Amid the Whitbread rout of preparation,"
15398,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,To treat the lofty ruler of the nation.
15399,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15400,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Now moved king, queen, and princesses so grand,"
15401,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,To visit the first brewer in the land;
15402,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Who sometimes swills his beer and grinds his meat
15403,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,In a snug corner christened Chiswell-street;
15404,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"But oftener charmed with fashionable air,"
15405,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Amid the gaudy great of Portman-square.
15406,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15407,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Lord Aylesbury, and Denbigh's Lord ALSO,"
15408,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,His grace the Duke of Montague LIKEWISE.
15409,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"With Lady Harcourt joined the raree-show,"
15410,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,And fixed all Smithfield's marveling eyes:
15411,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"For lo! a greater show ne'er graced those quarters,"
15412,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Since Mary roasted, just like crabs, the martyrs."
15413,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15414,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Arrived, the king broad grinned, and gave a nod"
15415,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To smiling Whitbread, who, had God"
15416,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Come with his angels to behold his beer,"
15417,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,With more respect he never could have met--
15418,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Indeed the man was in a sweat,"
15419,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,So much the brewer did the king revere.
15420,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15421,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Her majesty contrived to make a dip:
15422,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Light as a feather then the king did skip,"
15423,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"And asked a thousand questions, with a laugh,"
15424,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Before poor Whitbread comprehended half.
15425,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15426,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Reader, my Ode should have a simile--"
15427,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Well, in Jamaica, on a tamarind tree,"
15428,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Five hundred parrots, gabbling just like Jews,"
15429,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"I've seen--such noise the feathered imps did make,"
15430,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,As made my very pericranium ache--
15431,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Asking and telling parrot news:
15432,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15433,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Thus was the brewhouse filled with gabbling noise,"
15434,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Whilst draymen and the brewer's boys,"
15435,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Devoured the questions that the king did ask:
15436,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"In different parties were they staring seen,"
15437,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Wondering to think they saw a king and queen!
15438,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Behind a tub were some, and some behind a cask."
15439,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15440,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Some draymen forced themselves (a pretty luncheon)
15441,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Into the mouth of many a gaping puncheon;
15442,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"And through the bung-hole winked with curious eye,"
15443,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To view, and be assured what sort of things"
15444,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Were princesses, and queens, and kings,"
15445,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,For whose most lofty station thousands sigh!
15446,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"And lo! of all the gaping puncheon clan,"
15447,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Few were the mouths that had not got a man!
15448,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Now majesty into a pump so deep
15449,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Did with an opera-glass so curious peep:
15450,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Examining with care each wondrous matter
15451,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,That brought up water!
15452,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15453,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Thus have I seen a magpie in the street,"
15454,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"A chattering bird we often meet,"
15455,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,A bird for curiosity well known;
15456,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"With head awry,"
15457,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"And cunning eye,"
15458,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Peep knowingly into a marrow-bone.
15459,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15460,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,And now his curious majesty did stoop
15461,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,To count the nails on every hoop;
15462,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"And, lo! no single thing came in his way,"
15463,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"That, full of deep research, he did not say,"
15464,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"""What's this! hae, hae? what's that? what's this? what's that?"""
15465,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"So quick the words, too, when he deigned to speak,"
15466,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,As if each syllable would break his neck.
15467,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15468,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Thus, to the world of GREAT whilst others crawl,"
15469,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Our sovereign peeps into the world of SMALL;
15470,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Thus microscopic genuises explore
15471,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Things that too oft provoke the public scorn,"
15472,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Yet swell of useful knowledges the store,"
15473,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,By finding systems in a pepper-corn.
15474,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15475,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Now boasting Whitbread serious did declare,"
15476,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To make the majesty of England stare,"
15477,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"That he had butts enough, he knew,"
15478,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Placed side by side, to reach along to Kew:"
15479,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"On which the king with wonder swiftly cried,"
15480,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"""What, if they reach to Kew then, side by side,"
15481,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"What would they do, what, what, placed end to end?"""
15482,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"To whom with knitted, calculating brow,"
15483,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"The man of beer most solemnly did vow,"
15484,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Almost to Windsor that they would extend;
15485,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"On which the king, with wondering mien,"
15486,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Repeated it unto the wondering queen:
15487,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"On which, quick turning round his haltered head,"
15488,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"The brewer's horse, with face astonished neighed;"
15489,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"The brewer's dog too poured a note of thunder,"
15490,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Rattled his chain, and wagged his tail for wonder."
15491,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15492,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Now did the king for other beers inquire,"
15493,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"For Calvert's, Jordan's, Thrale's entire"
15494,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"And, after talking of these different beers,"
15495,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Asked Whitbread if his porter equalled theirs?
15496,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15497,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"This was a puzzling, disagreeing question;"
15498,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,Grating like arsenic on his host's digestion:
15499,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"A kind of question to the man of cask,"
15500,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,That not even Solomon himself would ask.
15501,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15502,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"Now majesty, alive to knowledge, took"
15503,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"A very pretty memorandum-book,"
15504,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,"With gilded leaves of asses' skin so white,"
15505,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,And in it legibly began to write--
15506,BIRTH-DAY ODE.,
15507,MEMORANDUM.,MEMORANDUM.
15508,MEMORANDUM.,A charming place beneath the grates
15509,MEMORANDUM.,For roasting chestnuts or potates.
15510,MEMORANDUM.,
15511,MEM.,MEM.
15512,MEM.,'Tis hops that give a bitterness to beer--
15513,MEM.,"Hops grow in Kent, says Whitbread, and elsewhere."
15514,MEM.,
15515,QUOERE.,QUOERE.
15516,QUOERE.,Is there no cheaper stuff? where doth it dwell?
15517,QUOERE.,Would not horse-aloes bitter it as well?
15518,QUOERE.,
15519,MEM.,MEM.
15520,MEM.,To try it soon on our small beer--
15521,MEM.,'Twill save us several pound a year.
15522,MEM.,
15523,MEM.,MEM.
15524,MEM.,To remember to forget to ask
15525,MEM.,Old Whitbread to my house one day
15526,MEM.,
15527,MEM.,MEM.
15528,MEM.,"Not to forget to take of beer the cask,"
15529,MEM.,"The brewer offered me, away."
15530,MEM.,
15531,MEM.,"Now having penciled his remarks so shrewd,"
15532,MEM.,"Sharp as the point indeed of a new pin,"
15533,MEM.,"His majesty his watch most sagely viewed,"
15534,MEM.,And then put up his asses' skin.
15535,MEM.,
15536,MEM.,"To Whitbread now deigned majesty to say,"
15537,MEM.,"""Whitbread, are all your horses fond of hay!"""
15538,MEM.,"""Yes, please your majesty,"" in humble notes,"
15539,MEM.,"The brewer answered--""also, sir, of oats:"
15540,MEM.,"Another thing my horses too maintains,"
15541,MEM.,"And that, an't please your majesty, are grains."""
15542,MEM.,
15543,MEM.,"""Grains, grains,"" said majesty, ""to fill their crops?"
15544,MEM.,"Grains, grains?--that comes from hops--yes, hops, hops?"
15545,MEM.,"hops?"""
15546,MEM.,
15547,MEM.,"Here was the king, like hounds sometimes, at fault--"
15548,MEM.,"""Sire,"" cried the humble brewer, ""give me leave"
15549,MEM.,Your sacred majesty to undeceive;
15550,MEM.,"Grains, sire, are never made from hops, but malt."""
15551,MEM.,
15552,MEM.,"""True,"" said the cautious monarch, with a smile:"
15553,MEM.,"""From malt, malt, malt--I meant malt all the while."""
15554,MEM.,"""Yes,"" with the sweetest bow, rejoined the brewer,"
15555,MEM.,"""An't please your majesty, you did, I'm sure."""
15556,MEM.,"""Yes,"" answered majesty, with quick reply,"
15557,MEM.,"""I did, I did, I did I, I, I, I."""
15558,MEM.,
15559,MEM.,Now this was wise in Whitbread--here we find
15560,MEM.,A very pretty knowledge of mankind;
15561,MEM.,"As monarchs never must be in the wrong,"
15562,MEM.,"'Twas really a bright thought in Whitbread's tongue,"
15563,MEM.,"To tell a little fib, or some such thing,"
15564,MEM.,To save the sinking credit of a king.
15565,MEM.,"Some brewers, in a rage of information,"
15566,MEM.,"Proud to instruct the ruler of a nation,"
15567,MEM.,"Had on the folly dwelt, to seem damned clever!"
15568,MEM.,"Now, what had been the consequence?  Too plain!"
15569,MEM.,The man had cut his consequence in twain;
15570,MEM.,The king had hated the WISE fool forever!
15571,MEM.,
15572,MEM.,"Reader, whene'er thou dost espy a nose"
15573,MEM.,"That bright with many a ruby glows,"
15574,MEM.,"That nose thou mayest pronounce, nay safely swear,"
15575,MEM.,Is nursed on something better than small-beer.
15576,MEM.,
15577,MEM.,"Thus when thou findest kings in brewing wise,"
15578,MEM.,"Or natural history holding lofty station,"
15579,MEM.,"Thou mayest conclude, with marveling eyes,"
15580,MEM.,Such kings have had a goodly education.
15581,MEM.,
15582,MEM.,"Now did the king admire the bell so fine,"
15583,MEM.,That daily asks the draymen all to dine:
15584,MEM.,On which the bell rung out (how very proper!)
15585,MEM.,"To show it was a bell, and had a clapper."
15586,MEM.,
15587,MEM.,"And now before their sovereign's curious eye,"
15588,MEM.,"Parents and children, fine, fat, hopeful sprigs,"
15589,MEM.,"All snuffling, squinting, grunting in their style,"
15590,MEM.,Appeared the brewer's tribe of handsome pigs:
15591,MEM.,"On which the observant man, who fills a throne,"
15592,MEM.,Declared the pigs were vastly like his own:
15593,MEM.,
15594,MEM.,"On which, the brewer, swallowed up in joys,"
15595,MEM.,"Tears and astonishment in both his eyes,"
15596,MEM.,"His soul brim full of sentiments so loyal,"
15597,MEM.,"Exclaimed, ""O heavens! and can my swine"
15598,MEM.,Be deemed by majesty so fine!
15599,MEM.,"Heavens! can my pigs compare, sire, with pigs royal?"""
15600,MEM.,To which the king assented with a nod;
15601,MEM.,"On which the brewer bowed, and said, ""Good God!"""
15602,MEM.,Then winked significant on Miss;
15603,MEM.,Significant of wonder and of bliss;
15604,MEM.,"Who, bridling in her chin divine,"
15605,MEM.,"Crossed her fair hands, a dear old maid,"
15606,MEM.,And then her lowest courtesy made
15607,MEM.,For such high honor done her father's swine.
15608,MEM.,
15609,MEM.,Now did his majesty so gracious say
15610,MEM.,"To Mr. Whitbread, in his flying way,"
15611,MEM.,"""Whitbread, d'ye nick the excisemen now and then?"
15612,MEM.,"Hae, Whitbread, when d'ye think to leave off trade?"
15613,MEM.,"Hae? what? Miss Whitbread's still a maid, a maid?"
15614,MEM.,"What, what's the matter with the men?"
15615,MEM.,
15616,MEM.,"""D'ye hunt!--hae, hunt? No, no, you are too old--"
15617,MEM.,You'll be lord mayor--lord mayor one day--
15618,MEM.,"Yes, yes, I've heard so--yes, yes, so I'm told:"
15619,MEM.,"Don't, don't the fine for sheriff pay?"
15620,MEM.,"I'll prick you every year, man, I declare:"
15621,MEM.,"Yes, Whitbread-yes, yes-you shall be lord mayor."
15622,MEM.,
15623,MEM.,"""Whitbread, d'ye keep a coach, or job one, pray?"
15624,MEM.,"Job, job, that's cheapest; yes, that's best, that's best"
15625,MEM.,You put your liveries on the draymen-hee?
15626,MEM.,"Hae, Whitbread? you have feather'd well your nest."
15627,MEM.,"What, what's the price now, hee, of all your stock?"
15628,MEM.,"But, Whitbread, what's o'clock, pray, what's o'clock?"""
15629,MEM.,
15630,MEM.,"Now Whitbread inward said, ""May I be cursed"
15631,MEM.,"If I know what to answer first;"""
15632,MEM.,Then searched his brains with ruminating eye:
15633,MEM.,"But e'er the man of malt an answer found,"
15634,MEM.,"Quick on his heel, lo, majesty turned round,"
15635,MEM.,"Skipped off, and baulked the pleasure of reply."
15636,MEM.,
15637,MEM.,Kings in inquisitiveness should be strong-
15638,MEM.,From curiosity doth wisdom flow:
15639,MEM.,"For 'tis a maxim I've adopted long,"
15640,MEM.,"The more a man inquires, the more he'll know."
15641,MEM.,
15642,MEM.,"Reader, didst ever see a water-spout?"
15643,MEM.,"'Tis possible that thou wilt answer, ""No."""
15644,MEM.,Well then! he makes a most infernal rout;
15645,MEM.,"Sucks, like an elephant, the waves below,"
15646,MEM.,"With huge proboscis reaching from the sky,"
15647,MEM.,As if he meant to drink the ocean dry:
15648,MEM.,At length so full he can't hold one drop more-.

15650,MEM.,"On some poor boat, or sloop, or brig, or ship,"
15651,MEM.,And almost sinks the wand'rer of the deep:
15652,MEM.,"Thus have I seen a monarch at reviews,"
15653,MEM.,"Suck from the tribe of officers the news,"
15654,MEM.,"Then bear in triumph off each WONDROUS matter,"

15656,MEM.,
15657,MEM.,I always would advise folks to ask questions;
15658,MEM.,"For, truly, questions are the keys of knowledge:"
15659,MEM.,"Soldiers, who forage for the mind's digestions,"
15660,MEM.,"Cut figures at the Old Bailey, and at college;"
15661,MEM.,"Make chancellors, chief justices, and judges,"
15662,MEM.,Even of the lowest green-bag drudges.
15663,MEM.,
15664,MEM.,"The sages say, Dame Truth delights to dwell,"
15665,MEM.,"Strange mansion! in the bottom of a well,"
15666,MEM.,Questions are then the windlass and the rope

15668,MEM.,"Damn jokes then, and unmannerly suggestions,"
15669,MEM.,Reflecting upon kings for asking questions.
15670,MEM.,
15671,MEM.,Now having well employed his royal lungs
15672,MEM.,"On nails, hoops, staves, pumps, barrels, and their bungs,"
15673,MEM.,The king and Co. sat down to a collation
15674,MEM.,"Of flesh and fish, and fowl of every nation."
15675,MEM.,"Dire was the clang of plates, of knife and fork,"
15676,MEM.,"That merciless fell like tomahawks to work,"
15677,MEM.,"And fearless scalped the fowl, the fish, and cattle,"
15678,MEM.,"While Whitbread, in the rear, beheld the battle."
15679,MEM.,
15680,MEM.,"The conquering monarch, stopping to take breath"
15681,MEM.,"Amidst the regiments of death,"

15684,MEM.,"""Whitbread, is't true? I hear, I hear,"
15685,MEM.,You're of an ancient family--renowned--

15689,MEM.,Son of a round-head are you? hae? hae? hae?
15690,MEM.,I'm told that you send Bibles to your votes--

15693,MEM.,"Bunyans, and Practices of Piety:"
15694,MEM.,Your Bedford votes would wish to change their fare--

15696,MEM.,Thirtieth of January don't you FEED?
15697,MEM.,"Yes, yes, you eat calf's head, you eat calf's head."""
15698,MEM.,
15699,MEM.,"Now having wonders done on flesh, fowl, fish,"
15700,MEM.,Whole hosts o'erturned--and seized on all supplies;
15701,MEM.,The royal visitors expressed a wish
15702,MEM.,To turn to House of Buckingham their eyes.
15703,MEM.,
15704,MEM.,"But first the monarch, so polite,"
15705,MEM.,Asked Mr. Whitbread if he'd be a KNIGHT.
15706,MEM.,"Unwilling in the list to be enrolled,"
15707,MEM.,"Whitbread contemplated the knights of Peg,"
15708,MEM.,"Then to his generous sovereign made a leg,"
15709,MEM.,"And said, ""He was afraid he was too old."
15710,MEM.,"He thanked however his most gracious king,"
15711,MEM.,"For offering to make him SUCH A THING."""
15712,MEM.,"But, ah! a different reason 'twas I fear!"
15713,MEM.,It was not age that bade the man of beer
15714,MEM.,The proffered honor of the monarch shun:
15715,MEM.,"The tale of Margaret's knife, and royal fright,"
15716,MEM.,"Had almost made him damn the NAME of knight,"
15717,MEM.,A tale that farrowed such a world of fun.
15718,MEM.,
15719,MEM.,"He mocked the prayer too by the king appointed,"
15720,MEM.,Even by himself the Lord's Anointed:--
15721,MEM.,"A foe to FAST too, is he, let me tell ye;"
15722,MEM.,"And though a Presbyterian, can not think"
15723,MEM.,Heaven (quarrelling with meat and drink)
15724,MEM.,Joys in the grumble of a hungry belly!
15725,MEM.,
15726,MEM.,Now from the table with Caesarean air
15727,MEM.,"Up rose the monarch with his laureled brow,"
15728,MEM.,"When Mr. Whitbread, waiting on his chair,"
15729,MEM.,"Expressed much thanks, much joy, and made a bow."
15730,MEM.,"Miss Whitbread now so quick her curtsies drops,"
15731,MEM.,Thick as her honored father's Kentish hops;
15732,MEM.,Which hop-like curtsies were returned by dips
15733,MEM.,That never hurt the royal knees and hips;
15734,MEM.,"For hips and knees of queens are sacred things,"
15735,MEM.,That only bend on gala days
15736,MEM.,"Before the best of kings,"
15737,MEM.,When odes of triumph sound his praise.--
15738,MEM.,
15739,MEM.,"Now through a thundering peal of kind huzzas,"
15740,MEM.,"Proceeding some from hired* and unhired jaws,"
15741,MEM.,The raree-show thought proper to retire;
15742,MEM.,Whilst Whitbread and his daughter fair
15743,MEM.,"Surveyed all Chiswell-street with lofty air,"
15744,MEM.,"For, lo! they felt themselves some six feet higher"
15745,MEM.,"*[Footnote: When his majesty goes to a play-house, or brew-house, or"

15753,MEM.,"acknowledge the obligation by a genteel bow, and an elegant curtesy."
15754,MEM.,"This congratulatory noise of the Stentors is looked on by many,"
15755,MEM.,"particularly country ladies and gentlemen, as an infallible"
15756,MEM.,"thermometer, that ascertains the warmth of the national regard--P. P.]"
15757,MEM.,
15758,MEM.,"Such, Thomas, is the way to write!"
15759,MEM.,Thus shouldst thou birth-day songs indite;
15760,MEM.,"Then stick to earth, and leave the lofty sky:"
15761,MEM.,"No more of ti tum tum, and ti tum ti."
15762,MEM.,
15763,MEM.,Thus should an honest laureate write of kings--
15764,MEM.,Not praise them for IMAGINARY THINGS;
15765,MEM.,I own I can not make my stubborn rhyme
15766,MEM.,Call every king a character sublime;
15767,MEM.,For conscience will not suffer me to wander
15768,MEM.,So very widely from the paths of candor.
15769,MEM.,"I know full well SOME kings are to be seen,"
15770,MEM.,"To whom my verse so bold would give the spleen,"

15772,MEM.,I won't say that they NEVER brains possessed--
15773,MEM.,"They MAY have been with such a present blessed,"
15774,MEM.,And therefore fancy that some STILL remains;
15775,MEM.,
15776,MEM.,"For every well-experienced surgeon knows,"
15777,MEM.,"That men who with their legs have parted,"
15778,MEM.,"Swear that they've felt a pain in all their TOES,"
15779,MEM.,And often at the twinges started;
15780,MEM.,They stared upon their oaken stumps in vain!
15781,MEM.,Fancying the toes were all come back again.
15782,MEM.,
15783,MEM.,"If men, then, who their absent toes have mourned,"
15784,MEM.,Can fancy those same toes at times returned;

16322,JAMES SMITH.,
16323,JAMES SMITH.,"My brother Jack was nine in May,"

16325,JAMES SMITH.,So in Kate Wilson's shop
16326,JAMES SMITH.,Papa (he's my papa and Jack's)
16327,JAMES SMITH.,"Bought me, last week, a doll of wax,"
16328,JAMES SMITH.,And brother Jack a top.
16329,JAMES SMITH.,"Jack's in the pouts, and this it is--"
16330,JAMES SMITH.,He thinks mine came to more than his;
16331,JAMES SMITH.,"So to my drawer he goes,"
16332,JAMES SMITH.,"Takes out the doll, and, O, my stars!"
16333,JAMES SMITH.,"He pokes her head between the bars,"
16334,JAMES SMITH.,And melts off half her nose!

16336,JAMES SMITH.,"Quite cross, a bit of string I beg,"
16337,JAMES SMITH.,"And tie it to his peg-top's peg,"
16338,JAMES SMITH.,"And bang, with might and main,"
16339,JAMES SMITH.,Its head against the parlor-door:
16340,JAMES SMITH.,"Off flies the head, and hits the floor,"
16341,JAMES SMITH.,And breaks a window-pane.
16342,JAMES SMITH.,
16343,JAMES SMITH.,This made him cry with rage and spite:
16344,JAMES SMITH.,"Well, let him cry, it serves him right"
16345,JAMES SMITH.,"A pretty thing, forsooth!"
16346,JAMES SMITH.,"If he's to melt, all scalding hot,"
16347,JAMES SMITH.,"Half my doll's nose, and I am not"

16349,JAMES SMITH.,
16350,JAMES SMITH.,"Aunt Hannah heard the window break,"

16357,JAMES SMITH.,"Well, after many a sad reproach,"

16367,JAMES SMITH.,"I wiped the dust from off the top,"
16368,JAMES SMITH.,"While Molly mopped it with a mop,"
16369,JAMES SMITH.,And brushed it with a broom.
16370,JAMES SMITH.,
16371,JAMES SMITH.,"My uncle's porter, Samuel Hughes,"
16372,JAMES SMITH.,"Came in at six to black the shoes,"
16373,JAMES SMITH.,(I always talk to Sam:)
16374,JAMES SMITH.,"So what does he, but takes, and drags"
16375,JAMES SMITH.,"Me in the chaise along the flags,"

16378,JAMES SMITH.,"My father's walls are made of brick,"

16390,JAMES SMITH.,They keep them on the ground.
16391,JAMES SMITH.,
16392,JAMES SMITH.,"At first I caught hold of the wing,"
16393,JAMES SMITH.,And kept away; but Mr. Thing-
16394,JAMES SMITH.,"umbob, the prompter man,"
16395,JAMES SMITH.,"Gave with his hand my chaise a shove,"

16429,JAMES SMITH,"My pensive Public, wherefore look you sad?"
16430,JAMES SMITH,"I had a grandmother, she kept a donkey"
16431,JAMES SMITH,"To carry to the mart her crockery-ware,"
16432,JAMES SMITH,"And when that donkey looked me in the face,"
16433,JAMES SMITH,"His face was sad I and you are sad, my Public."
16434,JAMES SMITH,
16435,JAMES SMITH,Joy should be yours: this tenth day of October
16436,JAMES SMITH,Again assembles us in Drury Lane.
16437,JAMES SMITH,Long wept my eye to see the timber planks
16438,JAMES SMITH,"That hid our ruins; many a day I cried,"
16439,JAMES SMITH,Ah me! I fear they never will rebuild it!
16440,JAMES SMITH,"Till on one eve, one joyful Monday eve,"
16441,JAMES SMITH,As along Charles-street I prepared to walk.
16442,JAMES SMITH,"Just at the corner, by the pastrycook's,"
16443,JAMES SMITH,I heard a trowel tick against a brick.
16444,JAMES SMITH,"I looked me up, and straight a parapet"
16445,JAMES SMITH,Uprose at least seven inches o'er the planks.
16446,JAMES SMITH,"Joy to thee, Drury! to myself I said:"
16447,JAMES SMITH,"He of the Blackfriars' Road, who hymned thy downfall"
16448,JAMES SMITH,"In loud Hosannahs, and who prophesied"
16449,JAMES SMITH,"That flames, like those from prostrate Solyma,"
16450,JAMES SMITH,"Would scorch the hand that ventured to rebuild thee,"
16451,JAMES SMITH,"Has proved a lying prophet. From that hour,"
16452,JAMES SMITH,"As leisure offered, close to Mr. Spring's"
16453,JAMES SMITH,"Box-office door, I've stood and eyed the builders."
16454,JAMES SMITH,They had a plan to render less their labors;
16455,JAMES SMITH,Workmen in olden times would mount a ladder
16456,JAMES SMITH,"With hodded heads, but these stretched forth a pole"
16457,JAMES SMITH,"From the wall's pinnacle, they placed a pulley"
16458,JAMES SMITH,"Athwart the pole, a rope athwart the pulley;"
16459,JAMES SMITH,To this a basket dangled; mortar and bricks
16460,JAMES SMITH,"Thus freighted, swung securely to the top,"
16461,JAMES SMITH,And in the empty basket workmen twain
16462,JAMES SMITH,"Precipitate, unhurt, accosted earth."
16463,JAMES SMITH,
16464,JAMES SMITH,"Oh! 't was a goodly sound, to hear the people"
16465,JAMES SMITH,"Who watched the work, express their various thoughts!"
16466,JAMES SMITH,"While some believed it never would be finished,"
16467,JAMES SMITH,"Some, on the contrary, believed it would."
16468,JAMES SMITH,
16469,JAMES SMITH,I've heard our front that faces Drury Lane
16470,JAMES SMITH,"Much criticised; they say 'tis vulgar brick-work,"
16471,JAMES SMITH,A mimic manufactory of floor-cloth.
16472,JAMES SMITH,One of the morning papers wished that front
16473,JAMES SMITH,Cemented like the front in Brydges-street;
16474,JAMES SMITH,"As now it looks, they call it Wyatt's Mermaid,"
16475,JAMES SMITH,A handsome woman with a fish's tail.
16476,JAMES SMITH,
16477,JAMES SMITH,"White is the steeple of St. Bride's in Fleet-street,"
16478,JAMES SMITH,The Albion (as its name denotes) is white;
16479,JAMES SMITH,Morgan and Saunders' shop for chairs and tables
16480,JAMES SMITH,Gleams like a snow-ball in the setting sun;
16481,JAMES SMITH,"White is Whitehall. But not St. Bride's in Fleet-street,"
16482,JAMES SMITH,"The spotless Albion, Morgan, no, nor Saunders,"
16483,JAMES SMITH,"Nor white Whitehall, is white as Drury's face."
16484,JAMES SMITH,
16485,JAMES SMITH,"Oh, Mr. Whitbread! fie upon you, sir!"
16486,JAMES SMITH,I think you should have built a colonnade;
16487,JAMES SMITH,"When tender Beauty, looking for her coach,"
16488,JAMES SMITH,"Protrudes her gloveless hand, perceives the shower,"
16489,JAMES SMITH,"And draws the tippet closer round her throat,"
16490,JAMES SMITH,"Perchance her coach stands half a dozen off,"
16491,JAMES SMITH,"And, ere she mounts the step, the oozing mud"
16492,JAMES SMITH,"Soaks through her pale kid slipper. On the morrow,"
16493,JAMES SMITH,"She coughs at breakfast, and her gruff papa"
16494,JAMES SMITH,"Cries, ""There you go! this comes of playhouses!"""
16495,JAMES SMITH,To build no portico is penny wise:
16496,JAMES SMITH,Heaven grant it prove not in the end pound foolish!
16497,JAMES SMITH,
16498,JAMES SMITH,"Hail to thee, Drury! Queen of Theaters!"
16499,JAMES SMITH,"What is the Regency in Tottenham-street,"
16500,JAMES SMITH,"The Royal Amphitheater of Arts,"
16501,JAMES SMITH,"Astley's, Olympic, or the Sans Pareil,"
16502,JAMES SMITH,Compared with thee? Yet when I view thee pushed
16503,JAMES SMITH,"Back from the narrow street that christened thee,"
16504,JAMES SMITH,I know not why they call thee Drury Lane.
16505,JAMES SMITH,"Amid the freaks that modern fashion sanctions,"
16506,JAMES SMITH,It grieves me much to see live animals
16507,JAMES SMITH,"Brought on the stage. Grimaldi has his rabbit,"
16508,JAMES SMITH,"Laurent his cat, and Bradbury his pig;"
16509,JAMES SMITH,"Fie on such tricks! Johnson, the machinist"
16510,JAMES SMITH,"Of former Drury, imitated life"
16511,JAMES SMITH,"Quite to the life. The elephant in Blue Beard,"
16512,JAMES SMITH,"Stuffed by his hand, wound round his lithe proboscis"
16513,JAMES SMITH,As spruce as he who roared in Padmanaba.
16514,JAMES SMITH,"[Footnote: ""Padmanaba,"" viz., in a pantomime called Harlequin in"
16515,JAMES SMITH,"Padmanaba. This elephant, some years afterward, was exhibited over"
16516,JAMES SMITH,"Exeter 'Change, where it was found necessary to destroy the poor"
16517,JAMES SMITH,animal by discharges of musketry. When he made his entrance in the
16518,JAMES SMITH,"pantomime above-mentioned, Johnson, the machinist of the rival house,"

16522,JAMES SMITH,Naught born on earth should die. On hackney stands

16525,JAMES SMITH,"Prey on a fly, a magpie on a worm,"

16851,THE BURNING.,"Loud shouted all in signs of woe,"
16852,THE BURNING.,"""A Muggins! to the rescue, ho!"""
16853,THE BURNING.,And poured the hissing tide:
16854,THE BURNING.,"Meanwhile the Muggins fought amain,"
16855,THE BURNING.,"And strove and struggled all in vain,"

16858,THE BURNING.,
16859,THE BURNING.,"Did none attempt, before he fell,"

16869,THE BURNING.,But sulphury stench and boiling drench
16870,THE BURNING.,"Destroying sight o'erwhelmed him quite,"

16872,THE BURNING.,"Still o'er his head, while Fate he braved,"

20592,PUNCH.,PUNCH.
20593,PUNCH.,
20594,PUNCH.,The partial power that to the female race
20595,PUNCH.,"Is charged to apportion gifts of form and grace,"
20596,PUNCH.,"With liberal hand molds beauty's curves in one,"
20597,PUNCH.,And to another gives as good as none:
20598,PUNCH.,"But woman still for nature proves a match,"
20599,PUNCH.,"And grace by her denied, from art will snatch."
20600,PUNCH.,"Hence, great ELIZA, grew thy farthingales;"
20601,PUNCH.,"Hence, later ANNA, swelled thy hoops' wide pales;"
20602,PUNCH.,To this we must refer the use of stays;
20603,PUNCH.,Nor less the bustle of more modern days.
20604,PUNCH.,
20605,PUNCH.,Artful device! whose imitative pad
20606,PUNCH.,Into good figures roundeth off the bad--
20607,PUNCH.,"Whether of simple sawdust thou art seen,"
20608,PUNCH.,Or tak'st the guise of costlier crinoline--
20609,PUNCH.,How oft to thee the female form doth owe
20610,PUNCH.,"A grace rotund, a line of ampler flow,"
20611,PUNCH.,Than flesh and blood thought fit to clothe it with below!
20612,PUNCH.,
20613,PUNCH.,"There dwelt in Liverpool a worthy dame,"
20614,PUNCH.,Who had a friend--JAMES TAYLOR was his name.
20615,PUNCH.,"He dealt in glass, and drove a thriving trade"
20616,PUNCH.,"And still saved up the profits that he made,"
20617,PUNCH.,"Till when a daughter blessed his marriage bed,"
20618,PUNCH.,The father in the savings-bank was led
20619,PUNCH.,"In his child's name a small sum to invest,"
20620,PUNCH.,From which he drew the legal interest.
20621,PUNCH.,"Years went and came; JAMES TAYLOR came and went,"
20622,PUNCH.,"Paid in, and drew, his modest three per cent,"
20623,PUNCH.,"Till, by the time his child reach'd girlhood's bounds,"
20624,PUNCH.,The sum had ris'n to two-and-twenty pounds.
20625,PUNCH.,
20626,PUNCH.,Our cautious legislature--well 'tis known--
20627,PUNCH.,Round savings-banks a guardian fence has thrown:
20628,PUNCH.,"'Tis easy to pay into them, no doubt,"
20629,PUNCH.,Though any thing but easy to draw out.
20630,PUNCH.,And so JAMES TAYLOR found; for on a day
20631,PUNCH.,"He wanted twenty pounds a bill to pay,"
20632,PUNCH.,"And, short of cash, unto the bank applied;"
20633,PUNCH.,"Failing some form of law, he was denied!"
20634,PUNCH.,
20635,PUNCH.,JAMES TAYLOR humm'd and haw'd--look'd blank and blue;--
20636,PUNCH.,"In short, JAMES TAYLOR knew not what to do:"
20637,PUNCH.,His creditor was stern--the bill was over due.
20638,PUNCH.,As to a friend he did his plight deplore--
20639,PUNCH.,The worthy dame of whom I spoke before--
20640,PUNCH.,"(It might cause pain to give the name she owns,"
20641,PUNCH.,So let me use the pseudonym of JONES);
20642,PUNCH.,"""TAYLOR,"" said MRS. JONES, ""as I'm a friend,"
20643,PUNCH.,I do not care if I the money lend.
20644,PUNCH.,But even friends security should hold:
20645,PUNCH.,"Give me security--I'll lend the gold."""
20646,PUNCH.,"""This savings-bank deposit-book!"" he cries."
20647,PUNCH.,"""See--in my daughter's name the sum that lies!"""
20648,PUNCH.,"She saw--and, satisfied, the money lent;"
20649,PUNCH.,Wherewith JAMES TAYLOR went away content.
20650,PUNCH.,But now what cares seize MRS. JONES'S breast!
20651,PUNCH.,What terrors throng her once unbroken rest!
20652,PUNCH.,"Cash she could keep, in many a secret nook--"
20653,PUNCH.,But where to stow away JAMES TAYLOR'S book?
20654,PUNCH.,Money is heavy: where 'tis put 't will stay;
20655,PUNCH.,Paper--as WILLIAM COBBETT used to say--
20656,PUNCH.,"Will make wings to itself, and fly away!"
20657,PUNCH.,"Long she devised: new plans the old ones chase,"
20658,PUNCH.,Until at last she hit upon a place.
20659,PUNCH.,"Was't VENUS that the strange concealment planned,"
20660,PUNCH.,Or rather PLUTUS'S irreverent hand?
20661,PUNCH.,Good MRS. JONES was of a scraggy make;
20662,PUNCH.,But when did woman vanity forsake?
20663,PUNCH.,"What nature sternly to her form denied,"
20664,PUNCH.,"A Bustle's ample aid had well supplied,"
20665,PUNCH.,Within whose vasty depths the book might safely hide!
20666,PUNCH.,
20667,PUNCH.,"'Twas thought--'twas done! by help of ready pin,"
20668,PUNCH.,"The sawdust was let out, the book put in."
20669,PUNCH.,"Henceforth--at home--abroad--where'er she moved,"
20670,PUNCH.,Behind her lurk'd the volume that she loved.
20671,PUNCH.,She laughed to scorn the cut-purse and his sleight:
20672,PUNCH.,No fear of burglars scared her through the night;
20673,PUNCH.,
20674,PUNCH.,"But ah, what shrine is safe from greed of gold,"
20675,PUNCH.,What fort against cupidity can hold?
20676,PUNCH.,"Can stoutest buckram's triple fold keep in,"
20677,PUNCH.,The ODOR LUCRI--the strong scent of TIN?
20678,PUNCH.,"For which CHUBB's locks are weak, and MILNER's safes are thin."
20679,PUNCH.,
20680,PUNCH.,"Some time elapsed--the time required by law,"
20681,PUNCH.,"Which past, JAMES TAYLOR might the money draw,"
20682,PUNCH.,"His kind but cautious creditor to pay,"
20683,PUNCH.,So to the savings-bank they took their way.
20684,PUNCH.,There MRS. JONES with modesty withdrew--
20685,PUNCH.,To do what no rude eye might see her do--
20686,PUNCH.,"And soon returning--with a blushing look,"
20687,PUNCH.,"Unmarked by TAYLOR, she produced the book."
20688,PUNCH.,"Which he, presenting, did the sum demand"
20689,PUNCH.,"Of MR. TOMKINS, the cashier so bland."
20690,PUNCH.,
20691,PUNCH.,What can there be upon the red-lined page
20692,PUNCH.,That TOMKINS's quick eye should so engage?
20693,PUNCH.,"What means his invitation to J.T.,"
20694,PUNCH.,"To ""Walk in for a moment""--""he would see""--"
20695,PUNCH.,"""Only a moment""--""'twas all right, no doubt,"""
20696,PUNCH.,"""It could not be""--""and yet""--here he slipped out,"
20697,PUNCH.,"Leaving JAMES TAYLOR grievously perplexed,"
20698,PUNCH.,And MRS. JONES by his behavior vexed.
20699,PUNCH.,"""What means the man by treating people so?"""
20700,PUNCH.,"Said TAYLOR, ""I am a loss to know."""
20701,PUNCH.,"Too soon, alas, the secret cause they knew!"
20702,PUNCH.,"TOMKINS return'd, and, with him, one in blue--"
20703,PUNCH.,"POLICEMAN X, a stern man and a strong,"
20704,PUNCH.,"Who told JAMES TAYLOR he must ""come along""--"
20705,PUNCH.,"And TOMKINS, seeing MRS. JONES aghast,"
20706,PUNCH.,Revealed the book was forged--from first to last!
20707,PUNCH.,
20708,PUNCH.,Who can describe the wrath of MRS. JONES?
20709,PUNCH.,The chill of fear that crept through TAYLOR'S bones?
20710,PUNCH.,The van--the hand-cuffs--and the prison cell
20711,PUNCH.,Where pined JAMES TAYLOR--wherefore pause to tell?
20712,PUNCH.,Soon came the Assizes--and the legal train;
20713,PUNCH.,In form the clerk JAMES TAYLOR did arraign;
20714,PUNCH.,"And though his council mustered tears at will,"
20715,PUNCH.,"And made black white with true Old Bailey skill,"
20716,PUNCH.,"TAYLOR, though MRS. JONES for mercy sued,"
20717,PUNCH.,Was doomed to five years' penal servitude;
20718,PUNCH.,"And in a yellow suit turned up with gray,"
20719,PUNCH.,To Portland prison was conveyed away!
20720,PUNCH.,
20721,PUNCH.,Time passed: forgot JAMES TAYLOR and his shame--
20722,PUNCH.,When lo--one day unto the bank there came
20723,PUNCH.,A new JAMES TAYLOR--a new MRS. JONES--
20724,PUNCH.,"And a new book, which TOMKINS genuine owns!"
20725,PUNCH.,"""Two TAYLORS and two JONESES and two books""--"
20726,PUNCH.,"Thought wary TOMKINS, ""this suspicious looks--"
20727,PUNCH.,"""The former TAYLOR, former JONES I knew--"
20728,PUNCH.,"These are imposters-yet the book is true!"""
20729,PUNCH.,When like a flash upon his mind it burst--
20730,PUNCH.,Who brought the second book had forged the first!
20731,PUNCH.,
20732,PUNCH.,"Again was summon'd X, the stern, the strong--"
20733,PUNCH.,"Again that pair were bid to ""Come along!"""
20734,PUNCH.,"The truth before the justices appear'd,"
20735,PUNCH.,And wrong'd JAMES TAYLOR'S character was clear'd.
20736,PUNCH.,
20737,PUNCH.,"In evil hour--by what chance ne'er was known,"
20738,PUNCH.,"Whether the bustle's seam had come unsewn,"
20739,PUNCH.,Or MRS. JONES by chance had laid aside
20740,PUNCH.,The artificial charms that decked her side--
20741,PUNCH.,"But so it was, how or whene'er assailed--"
20742,PUNCH.,The treacherous hiding-place was tried--and failed!
20743,PUNCH.,
20744,PUNCH.,The book was ta'en--a forged one fill'd its place;-
20745,PUNCH.,And MRS. JONES was robb'd--not to her face--
20746,PUNCH.,And poor JAMES TAYLOE doom'd to trial and disgrace!
20747,PUNCH.,
20748,PUNCH.,Who shall describe her anguish--her remorse?
20749,PUNCH.,"James Taylor was at once released, of course;"
20750,PUNCH.,"And Mrs. Jones, repentant, inly swore"
20751,PUNCH.,"Henceforth to carry, what she'd keep, before."
20752,PUNCH.,
20753,PUNCH.,"My tale is told--and, what is more, 'tis true:"
20754,PUNCH.,I read it in the papers--so may you.
20755,PUNCH.,And this its moral: Mrs. Joneses all--
20756,PUNCH.,"Though reticules may drop, and purses fall,"
20757,PUNCH.,"Though thieves may unprotected females hustle,"
20758,PUNCH.,Never invest your money in a bustle.

24812,THOMAS HOOD.,When my passion began first to work;
24813,THOMAS HOOD.,"But I know we were certainly looking for lamb,"
24814,THOMAS HOOD.,And the season was over for pork.
24815,THOMAS HOOD.,
24816,THOMAS HOOD.,"'T was at Christmas, I think, when I met with Miss Chase,"
24817,THOMAS HOOD.,Yes--for Morris had asked me to dine--
24818,THOMAS HOOD.,"And I thought I had never beheld such a face,"
24819,THOMAS HOOD.,Or so noble a turkey and chine.
24820,THOMAS HOOD.,
24821,THOMAS HOOD.,"Placed close by her side, it made others quite wild"
24822,THOMAS HOOD.,"With sheer envy, to witness my luck;"
24823,THOMAS HOOD.,"How she blushed as I gave her some turtle, and smiled"
24824,THOMAS HOOD.,As I afterward offered some duck.
24825,THOMAS HOOD.,
24826,THOMAS HOOD.,"I looked and I languished, alas! to my cost,"
24827,THOMAS HOOD.,Through three courses of dishes and meats;
24828,THOMAS HOOD.,Getting deeper in love--but my heart was quite lost
24829,THOMAS HOOD.,When it came to the trifle and sweets.
24830,THOMAS HOOD.,
24831,THOMAS HOOD.,"With a rent-roll that told of my houses and land,"
24832,THOMAS HOOD.,To her parents I told my designs--
24833,THOMAS HOOD.,"And then to herself I presented my hand,"
24834,THOMAS HOOD.,With a very fine pottle of pines!
24835,THOMAS HOOD.,
24836,THOMAS HOOD.,"I asked her to have me for weal or for woe,"
24837,THOMAS HOOD.,And she did not object in the least;--
24838,THOMAS HOOD.,I can't tell the date--but we married I know
24839,THOMAS HOOD.,Just in time to have game at the feast.

26874,PUNCH.,the language of a country undergoes a great alteration; that the Latin

27740,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,excessively numerous. He has dabbled in every thing. Prose and Poetry
27741,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,are alike familiar to his pen. One moment he will be up the highest
27742,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"flights of philosophy, and the next he will be down in some kitchen"
27743,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"garden of literature, culling an Enormous Gooseberry, to present it to"
27744,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the columns of some provincial newspaper. His contributions are
27745,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,scattered wherever the English language is read. Open any volume of
27746,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Miscellanies at any place you will, and you are sure to fall upon some"
27747,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,choice little bit signed by 'Anon.' What a mind his must have been! It
27748,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,took in every thing like a pawnbroker's shop. Nothing was too trifling
27749,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,for its grasp. Now he was hanging on to the trunk of an elephant and
27750,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,explaining to you how it was more elastic than a pair of India-rubber
27751,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,braces; and next he would be constructing a suspension bridge with a

27753,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,handkerchief's in the gallery of a theater when they want to fish up a

27757,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"signed with Anon's name were collected on rows of shelves, he would"
27758,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,require a British Museum all to himself. And yet of this great man so
27759,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,little is known that we are not even acquainted with his Christian
27760,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"name. There is no certificate of baptism, no moldy tombstone, no musty"
27761,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,washing-bill in the world on which we can hook the smallest line of
27762,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"speculation whether it was John, or James, or Joshua, or Tom, or Dick,"
27763,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"or Billy Anon. Shame that a man should write so much, and yet be known"
27764,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"so little. Oblivion uses its snuffers, sometimes, very unjustly. On"
27765,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"second thoughts, perhaps, it is as well that the works of Anon were not"
27766,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,collected together. His reputation for consistency would not probably
27767,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,be increased by the collection. It would be found that frequently he
27768,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,had contradicted himself---that in many instances when he had been
27769,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,warmly upholding the Christian white of a question he had afterward
27770,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"turned round, and maintained with equal warmth the Pagan black of it."
27771,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"He might often be discovered on both sides of a truth, jumping boldly"
27772,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"from the right side over to the wrong, and flinging big stones at any"
27773,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,one who dared to assail him in either position. Such double-sidedness
27774,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"would not be pretty, and yet we should be lenient to such"
27775,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"inconsistencies. With one who had written so many thousand volumes, who"
27776,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"had twirled his thoughts as with a mop on every possible subject, how"
27777,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,was it possible to expect any thing like consistency? How was it likely
27778,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,that he could recollect every little atom out of the innumerable atoms
27779,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,his pen had heaped up?
27780,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27781,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Anon ought to have been rich, but he lived in an age when piracy was"
27782,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the fashion, and when booksellers walked about, as it were, like Indian"
27783,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"chiefs with the skulls of the authors they had slain, hung round their"
27784,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"necks. No wonder, therefore, that we know nothing of the wealth of"
27785,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Anon. Doubtless he died in a garret, like many other kindred spirits,"
27786,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Death being the only score out of the many knocking at his door that he
27787,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,could pay. But to his immortal credit let it be said he has filled more
27788,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,libraries than the most generous patrons of literature. The volumes
27789,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,that formed the fuel of the barbarians' bonfire at Alexandria would be
27790,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"but a small book-stall by the side of the octavos, quartos, and"
27791,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,duodecimos he has pyramidized on our book-shelves. Look through any
27792,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"catalogue you will, and you will find that a large proportion of the"
27793,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,works in it have been contributed by Anon. The only author who can in

27798,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of a weekly newspaper, interspersed with poetry, the avowed object of"
27799,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"which was to expose the vicious doctrines of the French Revolution, and"
27800,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"to hold up to ridicule and contempt the advocates of that event, and"
27801,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the sticklers for peace and parliamentary reform. The editor was

27806,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Macdonald, and others. These gentlemen spared no means, fair or foul,"
27807,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,in their attempts to blacken their adversaries. Their most
27808,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"distinguished countrymen, if opposed to the Tory government of the time"
27809,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"being, were treated with no more respect than foreign adversaries, and"
27810,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"were held up to public execration as traitors, blasphemers, and"
27811,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"debauchees. The period was one of great political excitement, a fierce"
27812,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"war with republican France being in progress, the necessity for which"
27813,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,divided the public into two great parties; national credit being
27814,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"affected, the Bank of England suspending cash payments, mutinies"
27815,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"breaking out in the fleets at Spithead and the Nore, and Ireland at the"
27816,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"verge of rebellion. Spain, also, had declared war against Britain,"
27817,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,which was thus left to contend singly against the power of France.
27818,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Party feeling running very high, the anti-Jacobins were by no means"
27819,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"discriminating in their attacks, associating men together who really"

27824,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the same tune writing and talking in the opposite extreme, and little"
27825,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,quarter was given--certainly none on the part of the Tory wits. The
27826,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"poetry of the ""Anti-Jacobin,"" however, was not exclusively political,"
27827,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,comprising also parodies and burlesques on the current literature of
27828,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the day, some being of the highest degree of merit, and distinguished"
27829,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"by sharp wit and broad humor of the happiest kind. In these, Canning"
27830,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and his coadjutors did a real service to letters, and assisted in a"
27831,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"purification which Gifford, by his demolition of the Delia Cruscan"
27832,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,school of poetry had so well begun. Perhaps no lines in the English
27833,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,language have been more effective or oftener quoted than Canning's
27834,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Friend of Humanity and the Knife Grinder."" Many of the celebrated"
27835,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,caricatures of Gilray were originally designed to illustrate the Poetry
27836,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of the Anti-Jacobin. It had, however, but a brief, though brilliant"
27837,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,existence. Wilberforce and others of the more moderate supporters of
27838,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the ministry became alarmed at the boldness of the language employed.
27839,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Pitt (himself a contributor to the journal), was induced to interfere,"
27840,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and after a career of eight months, the ""Anti-Jacobin"" (in its original"

27846,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"never came into practice. He is tha author of several humorous pieces,"
27847,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,and of many in which the intention to be humorous was not realized. He
27848,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,is what the English call a very CLEVER man. Like many others who excel
27849,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"in ridicule and sarcasm, he is devoid of that kind of moral principle"
27850,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,which makes a writer prefer the Just to the Dashing. Aytoun is a fierce
27851,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Tory in politics--a snob on principle. The specimens of his humorous

27861,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Mr. Barham was born at Canterbury, England, December 6th, 1788. His"
27862,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"family is of great antiquity, having given its name to the well-known"
27863,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Barham Downs,"" between Dover and Canterbury. He was educated at St."
27864,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Paul's School in Canterbury, where he made the acquaintance of Richard"
27865,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Bentley, who afterward became his publisher. From this school, he wont"
27866,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"to Oxford, entering Brazennose College, as a gentleman commoner, where"
27867,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"he met Theodore Hook, and formed a friendship with that prince of wits"
27868,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"which terminated only with Hook's life. At the University, Barham led"
27869,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"a wild, dissipated life--as the bad custom then was--and was noted as a"
27870,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"wit and good fellow. Being called to account, on one occasion, by his"
27871,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"tutor for his continued absence from morning prayer, Barham replied,"
27872,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27873,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""The fact is, sir, you are too LATE for me."""
27874,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27875,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Too late?"" exclaimed the astonished tutor."
27876,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27877,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Yes, sir,"" rejoined the student, ""I can not sit up till seven o'clock"
27878,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"in the morning. I am a man of regular habits, and unless I get to bed"
27879,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"by four or five, I am fit for nothing the next day."""
27880,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27881,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"The tutor took this jovial reply seriously, and Barham perceiving that"
27882,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"he was really wounded, offered a sincere apology, and afterward"
27883,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,attended prayers more regularly.
27884,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27885,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Entering the church, he devoted himself to his clerical duties with"
27886,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"exemplary assiduity, and obtained valuable preferment, rising at length"
27887,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,to be one of the Canons of St. Paul's Cathedral. This office brought
27888,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"him into relations with Sydney Smith, with whom, though Barham was a"
27889,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Tory, he had much convivial intercourse."
27890,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27891,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Very early in life Mr. Barham became an occasional contributor to
27892,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Blackwood's Magazine, then in the prime of its vigorous youth. The"
27893,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"series of contributions called ""Family Poetry,"" which appear in the"
27894,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"volumes for 1823, and subsequent years, were by him. Most of those"
27895,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,humorous effusions have been transferred to this volume. In 1837 Mr.
27896,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Bentley established his ""Miscellany,"" and secured the services of his"
27897,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"friend Barham, who, up to this time was unknown to the general public,"
27898,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,though he had been for nearly twenty years a successful writer. The
27899,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Ingoldsby Legends"" now appeared in rapid succession, and proved so"
27900,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,popular that their author soon became one of the recognized wits of the
27901,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,day. A large number of these unique and excellent productions enrich
27902,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the present collection, ""As  respects these poems,"" says Mr. Barham's"
27903,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"biographer, ""remarkable as they have been pronounced for the wit and"
27904,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"humor which they display, their distinguishing attractions lies in the"
27905,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,almost unparalleled flow and felicity of the versification. Popular
27906,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"phrases, sentences the most prosaic, even the cramped technicalities of"
27907,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"legal diction, and snatches from well-nigh every language, are wrought"
27908,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"in with an apparent absence of all art and effort that surprises,"
27909,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"pleases, and convulses the reader at every turn. The author triumphs"
27910,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"with a master hand over every variety of stanza, however complicated or"
27911,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"exacting; not a word seems out of place, not an expression forced;"
27912,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"syllables the most intractable, and the only partners fitted for them"
27913,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,throughout the range of language are coupled together as naturally as
27914,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"those kindred spirits which poets tell us were created pairs, and"
27915,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,dispersed in space to seek out their particular mates. A harmony
27916,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"pervades the whole, a perfect modulation of numbers, never, perhaps,"
27917,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"surpassed, and rarely equaled in compositions of their class. This was"
27918,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the forte of Thomas Ingoldsby; a harsh line or untrue rhyme grated on
27919,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"his ear like the Shandean hinge."" These observations are just. As a"
27920,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"rhymer, Mr. Barham has but one equal in English literature--Byron."
27921,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27922,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Mr. Barham died at London on the 17th of June, 1845, in the"
27923,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"fifty-seventh year of his age. He was an extremely amiable,"
27924,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,benevolent character. It does not appear that his love of the
27925,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,humorous was ever allowed to interfere with the performance of his
27926,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"duties as a clergyman. Without being a great preacher, he was a"
27927,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"faithful and kindly pastor, never so much in his element as when"
27928,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"ministering to the distresses, or healing the differences of his"
27929,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"parishioners. Unlike his friend, Sydney Smith, he was singularly fond"
27930,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of the drama, and for many years was a member of the Garrick Club. He"
27931,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"was one of the few English writers of humorous verse, ALL of whose"
27932,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"writings may be read aloud by a father to his family, and in whose"
27933,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,wit there was no admixture of gall.

27935,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY""--A London Monthly Magazine, founded about twenty"
27936,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"years ago by Mr. Bentley, the publisher. Charles Dickens, and the"
27937,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,author of the Ingoldsby Legends were among the first contributors.
27938,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
27939,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE--First appeared in April, 1817 Founded by William"
27940,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Blackwood, a shrewd Edinburgh bookseller. Its literary ability and"
27941,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"fierce political partisanship, soon placed it fore-most in the ranks of"
27942,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Tory periodicals. Perhaps no magazine has ever achieved such celebrity,"
27943,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"or numbered such a host of illustrious contributors. John Wilson, the"
27944,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"world-famous ""Christopher North,"" was the virtual, though not nominal"
27945,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"editor, Blackwood himself retaining that title. It would be a long task"
27946,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"to enumerate all, who, from the days of Sir Walter Scott and the"
27947,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Ettrick Shepherd, to those of Bulwer and Charles Mackay, have appeared"
27948,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"in its columns. Maginn, Lockhart, Gillies, Moir, Landor, Wordsworth,"

27950,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Quincey, Allan Cunningham, Mrs. Hemans, Jerrold, Croly, Warren,"
27951,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Ingoldsby (Barham), Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Milnes, and many"
27952,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"others, of scarcely less note, found in Blackwood scope for their"
27953,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"productions, whether of prose or verse. In its early days much of"
27954,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"personality and sarcasm marked its pages, savage onslaughts on Leigh"
27955,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Hunt, and ""the Cockney School of Literature,"" alternating with attacks"
27956,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"on the Edinburgh Review, the Quarterly, and all Whigs and Whig"
27957,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"productions whatever. The celebrated Noctes Ambrosianae, a series of"
27958,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"papers containing probably more learning, wit, eloquence, eccentricity,"
27959,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"humor, and personality than have ever appeared elsewhere, formed part"
27960,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of the individuality of Blackwood. They were written by Wilson, Maginn,"
27961,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Lockhart, and Hogg, the two first named (and especially Wilson), having"
27962,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the pre-eminence. To the New York edition of this work, by Dr. Shelton"

27977,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"BUTLER, SAMUEL--Born in 1612; the son of a substantial farmer in"
27978,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Worcestershire, England. Very little is known of the earlier portion of"
27979,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"his life, as he had reached the age of fifty before he was so much as"
27980,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,heard of by his contemporaries. He appears to have received a good
27981,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"education at the cathedral school of his native county, and to have"
27982,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"filled various situations, as clerk in the service of Thomas Jeffries"
27983,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of Earl's Croombe, secretary to the Countess of Kent, and general man"
27984,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of business to Sir Samuel Luke, of Cople Hoo, Bedfordshire, who, it is"
27985,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"said, served as the model for his hero, Hudibras. The first part of"
27986,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"this singular poem was published at the close of 1662, and met with"
27987,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"extraordinary success. Its wit, its quaint sense and learning, its"
27988,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"passages of sarcastic reflection on all manner of topics, and above"
27989,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"all, its unsparing ridicule of men and things on the Puritan side,"
27990,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"combined to render it a general favorite. The reception of Part II.,"
27991,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"which appeared a year subsequent, was equally flattering. Yet its"
27992,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"author seems to have fallen into the greatest poverty and obscurity,"
27993,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,from which be never was enabled to emerge. It appears to have been his
27994,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"strange fate to flash all at once into notoriety, which lasted"
27995,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"precisely two years, to fill the court and town during that time with"
27996,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"continuous laughter, intermingled with inquiries who and what he was,"
27997,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and then for seventeen long years to plod on unknown and unregarded,"
27998,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"still hearing his Hudibras quoted, and still preparing more of it, or"
27999,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"matter similar, with no result. He died, in almost absolute"
28000,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"destitution, in 1680, and was buried at a friend's expense, in the"

28005,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"BYRON, GEORGE GORDON NOEL--Born 1788, died in Greece, 1824. Respecting"
28006,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"his celebrated Satire on the poet Rogers, which appears in this"
28007,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"collection, we read the following in a London periodical:--""The satire"
28008,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"on Rogers, by Lord Byron, is not surpassed for cool malignity,"
28009,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"dexterous portraiture, and happy imagery, in the whole compass of the"
28010,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"English language. It is said, and by those well informed, that Rogers"
28011,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"used to bore Byron while in Italy, by his incessant minute"
28012,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"dilettantism, and by visits at hours when Byron did not care to see"
28013,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,him. One of many wild freaks to repel his unreasonable visits was to
28014,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"set his big dog at him. To a mind like Byron's, here was sufficient"
28015,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"provocation for a satire. The subject, too, was irresistible. Other"
28016,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,inducements were not wanting. No man indulged himself more in
28017,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,sarcastic remarks on his cotemporaries than Mr. Rogers. He indulged
28018,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"his wit at any sacrifice. He spared no one, and Byron, consequently"
28019,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,did not escape. Sarcastic sayings travel on electric wings--and one of
28020,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Rogers's personal and amusing allusions to Byron reached the ears of
28021,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the poetic pilgrim at Ravenna. Few characters can bear the microscopic
28022,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,scrutiny of wit. Byron suffered. Fewer characters can bear its
28023,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"microscopic scrutiny when quickened by anger, and Rogers suffered still"
28024,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,more severely.
28025,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28026,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""This, the greatest of modern satirical portraits in verse, was written"
28027,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,before their final meeting at Bologna. Rogers was not aware that any
28028,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"saying of his had ever reached the ear of Byron, and Byron never"
28029,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,published the verses on Rogers. They met like the handsome women
28030,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"described by Cibber, who, though they wished one another at the devil,"
28031,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"are 'My dear,' and 'My dear,' whenever they meet. One doubtless"
28032,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"considered his saying as something to be forgotten, and the other his"
28033,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,verses as something not to be remembered. These verses are not included

28117,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of a London bookseller, and began life as a clerk. He became afterward"
28118,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"an engraver, but was drawn gradually into the literary profession,"
28119,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,which he exercised far more to the advantage of his readers than his
28120,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,own. His later years were saddened by ill-health and poverty. Some of
28121,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"his comic verses seem forced and contrived, as though done for needed"
28122,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,wages. Hood was one of the literary men who should have made of
28123,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"literature a staff, not a crutch. It was in him to produce, like Lamb,"
28124,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"a few very admirable things, the execution of which should have been"
28125,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the pleasant occupation of his leisure, not the toil by which he gained"
28126,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,his bread.

28159,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,died 1781. The epigrams of Lessing have been so frequently stolen by
28160,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"English writers, that, perhaps, they may now be considered as belonging"
28161,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"to English literature, and hence entitled to a place in this"

28177,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"MOORE, THOMAS--The Irish poet; born at Dublin in the year 1780. Moore"
28178,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,has been styled the best writer of political squibs that ever lived. He
28179,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"was employed to write comic verses on passing events, by the conductors"
28180,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of the ""London Times,"" in which journal many of his satirical poems"
28181,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,appeared. The political effusions that gave so much delight thirty
28182,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"years ago are, however, scarcely intelligible to the present"
28183,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"generation, or if intelligible, not interesting. But Moore wrote many a"
28184,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"sprightly stanza, the humor of which does not depend for its effect"
28185,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,upon local or cotemporary allusions. This collection contains most of
28186,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,them.

28208,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"PRAED, WINTHROP MACKWORTH--An English poet, author of ""Lillian,"" born"
28209,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,in London about the year 1800. Little is known of Mr. Praed in this
28210,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"country, though it was here that his poems were first collected and"
28211,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"published in a volume. His family is of the aristocracy of the city,"
28212,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,where some of his surviving relations are still engaged in the
28213,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"business of banking. At Eton, Praed was highly distinguished for his"
28214,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"literary talents. He was for some time the editor of ""The Etonian,"" a"
28215,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,piquant periodical published by the students. From Eton he went to
28216,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Cambridge, where he won an unprecedented number of prizes for poems"
28217,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and epigrams in Greek, Latin, and English. On returning to London, he"
28218,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,was associated with Thomas Babbington Macaulay in the editorship of
28219,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Knight's Quarterly Magazine,"" after the discontinuance of which he"
28220,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"occasionally contributed to the ""New Monthly."" A few years before"
28221,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"his death, Mr. Praed became a member of Parliament, but owing to his"
28222,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"love of ease and society, obtained little distinction in that body."
28223,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28224,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Mr. N. P. Willis thus writes of the poet as he appeared in society:
28225,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""We chance to have it in our power to say a word as to Mr. Praed's"
28226,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"personal appearance, manners, etc. It was our good fortune when first"
28227,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"in England (in 1834 or '35), to be a guest at the same hospitable"
28228,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,country-house for several weeks. The party there assembled was
28229,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"somewhat a femous one-Miss Jane Porter, Miss Julia Pardoe, Krazinski"
28230,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"(the Polish historian), Sir Gardiner Wilkinson (the Oriental traveler),"
28231,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"venerable Lady Cork ('Lady Bellair' of D'lsraeli's novel), and several"
28232,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"persons more distinguished in society than in literature. Praed, we"
28233,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"believe, had not been long married, but he was there with his wife. He"
28234,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"was apparently about thirty-five, tall, and of dark complexion, with a"
28235,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"studious bend in his shoulders, and of irregular features strongly"
28236,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"impressed with melancholy. His manners were particularly reserved,"
28237,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,though as unassuming as they could well be. His exquisitely beautiful
28238,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"poem of 'Lillian' was among the pet treasures of the lady of the house,"
28239,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and we had all been indulged with a sight of it, in a choicely bound"
28240,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,manuscript copy--but it was hard to make him confess to any literary
28241,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"habits or standing. As a gentleman of ample means and retired life, the"
28242,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"land of notice drawn upon him by the admiration of this poem, seemed"
28243,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,distasteful. His habits were very secluded. We only saw him at table
28244,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and in the evening; and, for the rest of the day, he was away in the"
28245,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"remote walks and woods of the extensive park around the mansion,"
28246,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,apparently more fond of solitude than of anything else. Mr. Praed's
28247,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,mind was one of wonderful readiness--rhythm and rhyme coming to him
28248,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,with the flow of an improvisatore. The ladies of the party made the
28249,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"events of every day the subjects of charades, epigrams, sonnets, etc.,"
28250,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,with the design of suggesting inspiration to his ready pen; and he was
28251,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"most brilliantly complying, with treasures for each in her turn."""
28252,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28253,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Mr. Praed died on the 15th of July, 1839, without having accomplished"
28254,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,any thing worthy the promise of his earlier years--another instance of
28255,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Life's reversing the judgment of College. As a writer of agreeable
28256,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"trifles for the amusement of the drawing-room, he has had few"
28257,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"superiors, and it is said that a large number of his impromptu"
28258,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,effusions are still in the possession of his friends unpublished. Two
28259,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"editions of his poems have appeared in New York, one by Langley in"
28260,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"1844, and another by Redfield a few years later."
28261,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28262,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"PRIOR, MATTHEW--Born 1664; died 1721. A wit and poet of no small genius"
28263,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,and good nature--one of the minor celebrities of the days of Queen
28264,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Anne. His ""Town and Country Mouse,"" written to ridicule of Dryden's"
28265,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"famous ""Hind and Panther,"" procured him the appointment of Secretary of"
28266,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Embassy at the Hague, and he subsequently rose to be ambassador at"
28267,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Paris. Suffering disgrace with his patrons he was afterward recalled,"
28268,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and received a pension from the University of Oxford, up to the time of"
28269,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,his death.
28270,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28271,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""PUNCH""--Commenced in July, 1841, making its appearance just at the"
28272,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"close of the Whig ministry, under Lord Melbourne, and the accession of"
28273,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the Tories, headed by Sir Robert Peel. Originated by a circle of wits"
28274,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and literary men who frequented the ""Shakspeare's Head,"" a tavern in"
28275,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Wych-street, London. Mark Lemon, the landlord was, and still is, its"
28276,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"editor. He is of Jewish descent, and had some reputation for ability"
28277,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"with his pen, having been connected with other journals, and also"
28278,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,written farces and dramatic pieces. Punch's earliest contributors were
28279,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Douglas Jerrold, Albert Smith, Gilbert Abbot a'Beckett Hood and Maginn-"
28280,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Thackeray's debut occurring in the third volume. It is said that one
28281,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,evening each week was especially devoted to a festive meeting of these
28282,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"writers, where, Lernon presiding, they deliberated as to the conduct"
28283,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and course of the periodical. ""Punch,"" however, was at first not"
28284,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"successful, and indeed on the point of being abandoned as a bad"
28285,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"speculation, when Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, two aspiring printers,"
28286,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"now extensive publishers, purchased it at the very moderate price of"
28287,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"one hundred pounds, since which time it has continued their property,"
28288,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,and a valuable one. In those days it presented a somewhat different
28289,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"appearance from the present, being more closely printed, finer type"
28290,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"used, and the illustrations (with the exception of small, black,"
28291,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"silhouette cuts, after the style of those in similar French"
28292,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"publications), were comparatively scanty. Soon, however, ""Punch"" throve"
28293,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"apace, amply meriting its success. To Henning's drawings (mostly those"
28294,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of a political nature), were added those of Leech, Kenny Meadows, Phiz"
28295,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"(H. K. Browne), Gilbert, Alfred Crowquill (Forrester), and"
28296,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,others--Doyle's pencil not appearing till some years later. Chief of
28297,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,these gentlemen in possession of the peculiar artistic ability which
28298,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"has identified itself with ""Punch"" is unquestionably Mr. John Leech,"
28299,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of whom we shall subsequently speak, at greater length. He has remained"
28300,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,constant to the journal from its first volume.
28301,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Jerrold's writings date from the commencement. Many essays and satiric
28302,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"sketches over fancy signatures, are from his pen. His later and longer"
28303,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"productions, extending through many volumes, are ""Punch's Letters to"
28304,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"his Son,"" ""Punch's Complete Letter Writer,"" ""Twelve Labors of"
28305,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Hercules,"" ""Autobiography of Tom Thumb,"" ""Mrs. Caudle's Curtain"
28306,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Lectures,"" ""Capsicum House for Young Ladies,"" ""Our Little Bird,"" ""Mrs."
28307,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Benimble's Tea and Toast,"" ""Miss Robinson Crusoe,"" and ""Mrs. Bib's"
28308,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Baby,"" the last two of which were never completed. During the"
28309,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"publication of the ""Caudle Lectures,"" ""Punch"" reached the highest"
28310,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,circulation it has attained. We have the authority of a personal friend
28311,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,of the author for the assertion that their heroine was no fictitious
28312,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"one. The lectures were immensely popular, Englishmen not being slow to"
28313,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,recognize in Jerold's caustic portraiture the features of a very
28314,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,formidable household reality. But with the ladies Mrs. Caudle proved no
28315,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"favorite, nor, in their judgment, did the ""Breakfast-Table-Talk,"" of"
28316,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the Henpecked Husband (subsequently published in the Almanac of the
28317,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"current year), make amends for the writer's former productions."
28318,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Albert Smith's contributions to the pages of ""Punch,"" were the"
28319,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Physiologies of the London Medical Student,"" ""London Idler,"" and"
28320,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Evening Parties,"" with other miscellaneous matter. Much of the"
28321,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"author's own personal experience is probably comprised in the former,"
28322,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,and his fellow-students and intimates at Middlesex Hospital were at no
28323,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,loss to identify the majority of the characters introduced. Mr. Smith's
28324,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"connection with ""Punch"" was not of long continuance. A severe criticism"
28325,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"appearing subsequently in its columns, on his novel of the ""Marchioness"
28326,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of Brinvilliers"" (published in ""Bentley's Miscellany,"" of which journal"
28327,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"he was then editor), he, in retaliation, made an onslaught on ""Punch"""
28328,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"in another story, the ""Pottleton Legacy,"" where it figures under the"
28329,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,title of the Cracker.
28330,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28331,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Mr. Gilbert a'Beckett, who had before been engaged in many unsuccessful"
28332,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"periodicals, found in ""Punch"" ample scope for his wit and extraordinary"
28333,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"faculty of punning. In ""The Comic Blackstone,"" ""Political Dictionary,"""
28334,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Punch's Noy's Maxims,"" and the ""Autobiography, and other papers"
28335,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"relating to Mr. Briefless,"" he put his legal knowledge to a comic use."
28336,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Many fugitive minor pieces have also proceeded from his pen, and he has"
28337,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,but few equals in that grotesque form of hybrid poetry known as
28338,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Macaronic. He is now a London magistrate, and PAR EXCELLENCE, the"
28339,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"punster of ""Punch."""
28340,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28341,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"The Greek versions of sundry popular ballads, such as ""The King of the"
28342,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Cannibal Islands,"" were the work of Maginn. Hood's world-famous ""Song"

28347,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"somewhat different fashion by a'Beckett in his ""Comic History of"

28351,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Man about Town,"" and ""The Proser."" Of the merits of these works it is"
28352,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"unnecessary to speak. The ""Book of Snobs"" may rank with its author's"
28353,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"most finished productions. ""Jeames's Diary,"" suggested by the"
28354,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,circumstance of a May-fair footman achieving sudden affluence by
28355,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"railroad speculations during the ruinously exciting period of 1846,"
28356,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"may, however, be considered only a further carrying out of the original"
28357,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"idea of ""Charles Yellowplush."" A ballad in it, ""The Lines to my"
28358,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Sister's Portrait,"" is said, to use a vulgar, though expressive phrase,"
28359,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"to have SHUT UP Lord John Manners, who had achieved some small"
28360,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"reputation as ""one of the Young England poits."" Thackeray parodied his"
28361,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"style, and henceforth the voice of the minstrel was dumb in the land."
28362,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Like Jerrold's ""Caudle Lectures,"" of which many versions appeared at"
28363,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the London theaters, Jeames's adventures were dramatized. The ""Prose"
28364,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Novelists"" contain burlesque imitations of Bulwer, D'Israeli, Lever,"
28365,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"James, Fennimore Cooper, and Mrs. Gore. The illustrations accompanying"
28366,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Thackeray's publications in ""Punch,"" are by his own hand, as are also"
28367,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,many other sketches scattered throughout the volumes. They may be
28368,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,generally distinguished by the insertion of a pair of spectacles in
28369,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the corner. His articles, too, frequently bear the signature ""SPEC."""
28370,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Not until the commencement of 1855 did Thackeray relinquish his

28385,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,and the continuous ridicule both of pen and pencil directed against
28386,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Prince Albert, was said to have provoked so much resentment on the part"
28387,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of the Queen, that she proposed interference to prevent the artist"
28388,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Doyle supplying two frescos to the pavilion at Buckingham Palace.
28389,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Punch's"" impartiality has been shown by attacks on the extremes and"
28390,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"absurdities of all parties, and there can be little question that it"
28391,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"has had considerable influence in producing political reform, and a"
28392,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,large and liberal advocacy of all popular questions. In behalf of that
28393,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"great change of national policy, the repeal of the Corn Laws, ""Punch"""
28394,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"fought most vigorously, not, however, forgetting to bestow a few raps"
28395,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,of his baton on the shoulders of the Premier whose wisdom or sense of
28396,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,expediency induced such sudden tergiversation as to bring it about.
28397,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,O'Connell's blatant and venal patriotism was held up to merited
28398,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"derision, which his less wary, but more honest followers in agitation,"
28399,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"O'Brien, Meagher, and Mitchell, equally shared. Abolition (or at least"
28400,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"modification) of the Game Laws, and of the penalty of death, found"
28401,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"championship in ""Punch,"" though the latter was summarily dropped upon a"
28402,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"change in public opinion, perhaps mainly induced by one of Carlyle's"
28403,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Latter Day"" pamphlets. ""Punch"" has repeatedly experienced (and"

28405,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,dominions of continental monarchs. Louis Philippe interdicted its
28406,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"presence in France, even (if we recollect aright) before the Spanish"
28407,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"marriage had provoked its fiercest attacks--subsequently, however,"
28408,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"withdrawing his royal veto. In Spain, Naples, the Papal Dominions,"
28409,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"those of Austria, Russia, and Prussia, the hunch-backed jester has been"
28410,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"often under ban as an unholy thing, or only tolerated in a mutilated"
28411,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"form. Up to the commencement of the late war, strict measures of this"
28412,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"kind were in operation upon the Russian frontier, but ""Punch"" now is"
28413,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,freely accorded ingress in the Czar's dominions--probably as a means of

28423,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,amounts to one of their institutions. Like all journals of merit and
28424,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"independence, it has had its law troubles, more than one action for"
28425,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"libel having been commenced against it. James Silk Buckingham, the"
28426,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"traveler and author, took this course, in consequence of the"
28427,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"publication of articles disparaging a club of his originating, known as"
28428,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the ""British and Foreign Institute."" A Jew clothes-man, named Hart,"
28429,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"obtained a small sum as damages from ""Punch."" But Alfred Bunn, lessee"
28430,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of Drury Lane Theater, libretto-scribbler, and author of certain trashy"
28431,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"theatrical books, though most vehemently ""pitched into,"" resorted to"
28432,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,other modes than legal redress. He produced a pamphlet of a shape and
28433,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"appearance closely resembling his tormentor, filled not only with"
28434,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"quizzical, satirical, and rhyming articles directed against Lemon,"
28435,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"a'Beckett, and Jerrold (characterizing them as Thick-head, Sleek-head,"
28436,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and Wrong-head), but with caricature cuts of each. Whether in direct"
28437,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"consequence or not, it is certain that ""the poet Bunn"" was unmolested"
28438,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,in future.

28440,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Our notice would scarcely be complete without a few lines devoted to
28441,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the ""Punch"" artists, and more especially John Leech. Doyle (the son of"
28442,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"H. B., the well-known political caricaturist), whose exquisite"
28443,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"burlesque medieval drawings illustrative of the ""Manners and Customs of"
28444,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"ye Englishe,"" will be remembered by all familiar with ""Punch's"" pages,"
28445,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,relinquished his connection with the journal and the yearly salary of
28446,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"eight hundred pounds, in consequence of the Anti-papal onslaughts which"
28447,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,followed the nomination of Cardinal Wiseman to the (Catholic)
28448,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Archbishop of Westminster. The artist held the older faith, and was"
28449,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"also a personal friend of ""His Eminence."" His place was then filled by"
28450,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"John Tenniel, a historical painter, who had supplied a cartoon to the"
28451,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Palace of Westminster, and is still employed on ""Punch,"" he, in"
28452,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"conjunction with John Leech, and an occasional outsider, furnishing the"
28453,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"entire illustrations. John Leech, himself, to whom the periodical"
28454,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"unquestionably owes half its success, has been constant to ""Punch"" from"
28455,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,an early day. He has brought caricature into the region of the fine
28456,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"arts, and become the very Dickens of the pencil in his portrayal of the"
28457,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"humorous side of life. Before his advent, comic drawing was confined to"
28458,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"very limited topics, OUTRE drawings and ugliness of features forming"
28459,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the fun--such as it was. Seymour's ""Cockney Sportsmen,"" and"
28460,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Cruikshank's wider (yet not extensive) range of subjects, were then the"
28461,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"best things extant. How stands the case now? Let ""Punch's"""
28462,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"twenty-nine volumes, with their ample store of pictorial mirth of"
28463,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Leech's creating, so kindly, so honest, so pleasant and graceful,"
28464,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,answer. Contrast their blameless wit and humor with the equivoque
28465,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and foul double entendre of French drawings, and think of the"
28466,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,difference involuntarily suggested between the social atmospheres of
28467,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,Paris and London.
28468,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28469,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Leech is a good-looking fellow, approaching the age of forty, and not"
28470,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"unlike one of his own handsome ""swells"" in personal appearance. The"
28471,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Royal Academy Exhibition of 1855 contained his portrait, painted by"
28472,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Millais, the chief of the pre-Raphaelite artists, who is said to be his"
28473,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"friend. As may be gathered from his many sporting sketches, Leech is"
28474,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"fond of horses, and piques himself on ""knowing the points"" of a good"
28475,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"animal. (We may mention, by-the-by, that Mr. ""Briggs"" of equestrian"
28476,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,celebrity had his original on the Stock Exchange.) He in summer travels
28477,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"considerably, forwarding his sketches to the ""Punch"" office, generally"
28478,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,penciling the accompanying words on the wood-block. In one of the past
28479,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"volumes, dating some eight or ten years back, he has introduced himself"
28480,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"in a cut designated ""our artist during the hot weather,"" wherein he"
28481,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"appears with his coat off, reclining upon a sofa, and informing a"
28482,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"pretty servant-girl who enters the room, that ""he is busy."" Quizzical"

28484,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"In Jerrold's ""Capsicum House"" (vol. XII.), the author's portrait,"

28487,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of the same volume, comprises sketches of the then entire corps of"

28499,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"REJECTED ADDRESSES, by James and Horace Smith, published in London,"
28500,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"October, 1812. The most successful jeu d'esprit of modern times, having"
28501,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"survived the occasion that suggested it for nearly half a century, and"
28502,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,still being highly popular. It has run through twenty editions in
28503,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"England, and three in America. The opening of Drury-lane theater in"
28504,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"1802, after having been burned and rebuilt, and the offering of a prize"
28505,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of fifty pounds by the manager for the best opening address, were the"
28506,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"circumstances which suggested the production of the ""Rejected"
28507,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Addresses.""  The idea of the work was suddenly conceived, and it was"
28508,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,executed in six weeks. In the preface to the eighteenth London edition
28509,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the authors give an interesting statement of the difficulties they
28510,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,encountered in getting the volume published:
28511,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28512,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""Urged forward by our hurry, and trusting to chance, two very bad"
28513,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"coadjutors in any enterprise, we at length congratulated ourselves on"
28514,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,having completed our task in time to have it printed and published by
28515,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the opening of the theater. But, alas! our difficulties, so far from"
28516,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"being surmounted, seemed only to be beginning. Strangers to the arcana"
28517,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"of the bookseller's trade, and unacquainted with their almost"
28518,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"invincible objection to single volumes of low price, especially when"
28519,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"tendered by writers who have acquired no previous name, we little"
28520,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"anticipated that they would refuse to publish our 'Rejected Addresses,'"
28521,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"even although we asked nothing for the copyright. Such, however, proved"
28522,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,to be the case. Our manuscript was perused and returned to us by
28523,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,several of the most eminent publishers. Well do we remember betaking
28524,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"ourselves to one of the craft in Bond-street, whom we found in a back"
28525,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"parlor, with his gouty leg propped upon a cushion, in spite of which"
28526,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,warning he diluted his luncheon with frequent glasses of Madeira. 'What
28527,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"have you already written?' was his first question, and interrogatory to"
28528,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,which we had been subjected in almost every instance. 'Nothing by which
28529,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,we can be known.' 'Then I am afraid to undertake the publication.' We
28530,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"presumed timidly to suggest that every writer must have a beginning,"
28531,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"and that to refuse to publish for him until he had acquired a name, was"
28532,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,to imitate the sapient mother who cautioned her son against going into
28533,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the water until he could swim. 'An old joke--a regular Joe!' exclaimed
28534,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"our companion, tossing off another bumper. 'Still older than Joe"
28535,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Miller,' was our reply; 'for, if we mistake not, it is the very first"
28536,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"anecdote in the facetiae of Hierocles.' 'Ha, sirs!' resumed the"
28537,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"bibliopolist, 'you are learned, are you? do, hoh!--Well, leave your"
28538,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"manuscript with me; I will look it over to-night, and give you an"
28539,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,answer to-morrow.' Punctual as the clock we presented ourselves at his
28540,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,door on the following morning when our papers were returned to us with
28541,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the observation--'These trifles are really not deficient in smartness;
28542,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"they are well, vastly well for beginners; but they will never"
28543,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"do--never. They would not pay for advertising, and without it I should"
28544,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,not sell fifty copies.'
28545,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28546,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""This was discouraging enough. If the most experienced publishers"
28547,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"feared to be out of pocket by the work, it was manifest D FORTIORI,"
28548,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"that its writers ran a risk of being still more heavy losers, should"
28549,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,they undertake the publication on their own account. We had no
28550,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,objection to raise a laugh at the expense of others; but to do it at
28551,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"our own cost, uncertain as we were to what extent we might be involved,"
28552,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"had never entered into our contemplation. In this dilemma, our"
28553,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"'Addresses,' now in every sense rejected, might probably have never"
28554,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"seen the light, had not some good angel whispered us to betake"
28555,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"ourselves to Mr. John Miller, a dramatic publisher, then residing in"
28556,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Bow-street, Covent Garden. No sooner had this gentleman looked over our"
28557,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"manuscript, than he immediately offered to take upon himself all the"
28558,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"risk of publication, and to give us half the profits, SHOULD THERE BE"
28559,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"ANY; a liberal proposition, with which we gladly closed. So rapid and"
28560,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"decided was its success, at which none were more unfeignedly astonished"
28561,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"than its authors, that Mr. Miller advised us to collect some"
28562,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"'Imitations of Horace,' which had appeared anonymously in the 'Monthly"
28563,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Mirror,' offering to publish them upon the same terms. We did so"
28564,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,accordingly; and as new editions of the 'Rejected Addresses' were
28565,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"called for in quick succession, we were shortly enabled to sell our"
28566,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"half copyright in the two works to Mr. Miller, for one thousand pounds!"
28567,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"We have entered into this unimportant detail, not to gratify any"
28568,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"vanity of our own, but to encourage such literary beginners as may"
28569,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,be placed in similar circumstances; as well as to impress upon
28570,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,publishers the propriety of giving more consideration to the possible
28571,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"merit of the works submitted to them, than to the mere magic of a"
28572,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"name."""
28573,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28574,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"The authors add, that not one of the poets whom they ""audaciously"
28575,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"burlesqued,"" took offense at the ludicrous imitation of their style."
28576,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"From ""Sir Walter Scott,"" they observe, ""we received favors and notice,"
28577,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"both public and private, which it will be difficult to forget, because"
28578,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,we had not the smallest claim upon his kindness. 'I certainly must have
28579,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,written this myself!' said that fine tempered man to one of the
28580,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"authors, pointing to the description of the Fire, 'although I forgot"
28581,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"upon what occasion.' Lydia White, a literary lady, who was prone to"
28582,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"feed the lions of the day, invited one of us to dinner; but,"
28583,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"recollecting afterward that William Spencer formed one of the party,"
28584,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,wrote to the latter to put him off; telling him that a man was to be at
28585,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,her table whom he 'would not like to meet.' 'Pray who is this whom I
28586,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"should not like to meet?' inquired the poet 'O!' answered the lady,"
28587,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,'one of those men who have made that shameful attack upon you!' 'The
28588,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,very man upon earth. I should like to know!' rejoined the lively and
28589,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"careless bard. The two individuals accordingly met, and have continued"
28590,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"fast friends over since. Lord Byron, too, wrote thus to Mr. Murray"
28591,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"from Italy: 'Tell him we forgive him, were he twenty times our"
28592,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,satirist.'
28593,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,
28594,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"""It may not be amiss to notice, in this place, one criticism of a"
28595,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Leicester clergyman, which may be pronounced unique: 'I do not see why"
28596,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"they should have been rejected,' observed the matter-of-fact annotator;"
28597,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"'I think some of them very good!' Upon the whole, few have been the"
28598,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"instances, in the acrimonious history of literature, where a malicious"
28599,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,pleasantry like the 'Rejected Addresses'--which the parties ridiculed
28600,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,might well consider more annoying than a direct satire--instead of
28601,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"being met by querulous bitterness or petulant retaliation, has procured"

28703,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"WOLCOTT, JOHN (Peter Pindar), the most voluminous, and one of the best"
28704,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,of the humorous poets who have written in the English language. He was
28705,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"born in Devonshire, England, and flourished in the reign of George III,"
28706,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,whose peculiarities it was his delight to ridicule. No king was ever so
28707,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,mercilessly and so successfully lampooned by a poet as George III by
28708,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Peter Pindar. Wolcott was by profession a Doctor of Medicine. In 1766,"
28709,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"we find him accompanying his relative, Sir William Trelawney, to"
28710,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Jamaica, of which island Sir William had been appointed governor. While"
28711,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"there, the rector of a valuable living died, and Dr. Wolcott conceived"
28712,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,the idea of entering the church and applying for the vacant rectorship.
28713,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"To this end he began actually to perform the duties of the parish,"
28714,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"reading prayers and preaching, and soon after returned to England to"
28715,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"take orders, provideed with powerful recommendations. To his great"
28716,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"disappointment, the Bishop of London refused him ordination, and the"
28717,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,reader of Peter Pindar will not be at a loss to guess the reason of the
28718,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"refusal. Wolcott now established himself in Truro, and continued in the"
28719,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,successful practice of medicine there for several years.

28721,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"At Truro, he met the youthful Opie. ""It is much to his honor,"" says one"
28722,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"who wrote in Wolcott's own lifetime, ""that during his residence in"
28723,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Cornwall, he discovered, and encouraged, the fine talents of the late"
28724,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Opie, the artist; a man of such modesty, simplicity of manners, and"
28725,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"ignorance of the world, that it is probable his genius would have lain"
28726,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"obscure and useless, had he not met, in Dr. Wolcott, with a judicious"
28727,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"friend, who knew how to appreciate his worth, and to recommend it tothe"
28728,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,admiration of the world. The Doctor's taste in painting has already
28729,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"been noticed; and it may now be added, that perhaps few men have"
28730,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"attained more correct notions on the subject, and the fluency with"
28731,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,which he expatiates on the beauties or defects of the productions of
28732,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the ancient or modern school, has been amply acknowledged by all who"
28733,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,have shared in his company. The same taste appears to have directed him
28734,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"to some of the first subjects of his poetical satire, when he began to"
28735,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,treat the public with the pieces which compose these volumes. The
28736,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,effect of these poems on the public mind will not be soon forgot.
28737,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Here appeared a new poet and a new critic, a man of unquestionable"
28738,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"taste and luxuriant fancy, combined with such powers of satire, as"
28739,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,became tremendously formidable to all who had the misfortune to fall
28740,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"under his displeasure. It was acknowledged at the same time, that amid"
28741,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"some personal acrimony, and some affectionate preferences, not far"
28742,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"removed, perhaps, from downright prejudice, he in general grounded his"
28743,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"praise and censure upon solid principles, and carried the public mind"
28744,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"along with him, although sometimes at the heavy expense of"
28745,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"individuals."""

28747,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"Later in life Dr. Wolcott removed to London, where he died at an"

28749,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"the time of their publication, but since the poet's death, they have"
28750,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,scarcely received the attention which their merits deserve. The present
28751,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,collection contains all of his best poems which are not of a character
28752,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,"too local and cotemporary, or too coarse in expression, to be enjoyed"
28753,CATALOGUE OF SOURCES,by the modern reader.
