47,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
48,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
49,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"In our Life of Dryden we promised to say something about the question,"
50,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"how far is a poet, particularly in the moral tendency and taste of his"
51,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"writings, to be tried--and either condemned or justified--by the"
52,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,character and spirit of his age? To a rapid consideration of this
53,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"question we now proceed, before examining the constituent elements or"
54,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the varied fruits of the poet's genius.
55,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
56,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"And here, unquestionably, there are extremes, which every critic should"
57,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"avoid. Some imagine that a writer of a former century should be tried,"
58,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,either by the standard which prevails in the cultured and civilised
59,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"nineteenth, or by the exposition of moral principles and practice which"
60,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"is to be found in the Scriptures. Now, it is obviously, so far as taste"
61,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"is concerned, as unjust to judge a book written in the style and manner"
62,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,of one age by the merely arbitrary and conventional rules established in
63,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"another, as to judge the dress of our ancestors by the fashions of the"
64,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"present day. And in respect of morality, it is as unfair to visit with"
65,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the same measure of condemnation offences against decorum or decency,"
66,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,committed by writers living before or living after the promulgation of
67,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the Christian code, as it would be to class the Satyrs, Priapi, and"
68,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Bacchantes of an antique sculptor, with their imitations, by inferior"
69,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and coarser artists, in later times. There must be a certain measure of"
70,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,allowance made for the errors of Genius when it was working as the
71,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"galley-slave of its tradition and period, and when it had not yet"
72,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"received the Divine Light which, shining into the world from above, has"
73,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,supplied men with higher Ã¦sthetic as well as spiritual models of
74,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"principles, and revealed man's body to be the temple of the Holy Ghost."
75,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"To look for our modern philanthropy in that ""Greek Gazette,"" the Iliad"
76,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,of Homer--to expect that reverence for the Supreme Being which the Bible
77,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,has taught us in the Metamorphoses of Ovid--or to seek that refinement
78,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of manners and language which has only of late prevailed amongst us, in"
79,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the plays of Aristophanes and Plautus--were very foolish and very vain.
80,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"In ages not so ancient, and which have revolved since the dawn of"
81,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Christianity, a certain coarseness of thought and language has been"
82,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"prevalent; and for it still larger allowance should be made, because it"
83,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,has been applied to simplicity rather than to sensuality--to rustic
84,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"barbarism, not to civilised corruption--and carries along with it a"
85,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rough raciness, and a reference to the sturdy aboriginal beast--just as"
86,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"acorns in the trough suggest the immemorial forests where they grew, and"
87,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the rich greenswards on which they fell.
88,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
89,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"In two cases, it thus appears, should the severest censor be prepared to"
90,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,modify his condemnation of the bad taste or the impurity to be found in
91,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"writers of genius--first, in that of a civilization, perfect in its"
92,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"kind, but destitute of the refining and sublimating element which a"
93,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"revelation only can supply; and, secondly, in that of those ages in"
94,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,which the lights of knowledge and religion are contending with the gloom
95,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,of barbarian rudeness. Perhaps there are still two other cases capable
96,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of palliation--that of a mind so constituted as to be nothing, if not a"
97,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"mirror of its age, and faithfully and irresistibly reflecting even its"
98,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,vices and pollutions; or that of a mind morbidly in love with the
99,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,morbidities and the vile passages of human nature. But suppose the case
100,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of a writer, sitting under the full blaze of Gospel truth, professedly a"
101,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"believer in the Gospel, and intimately acquainted with its oracles,"
102,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"living in a late and dissipated, not a rude and simple age--possessed of"
103,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"varied and splendid talents, which qualified him to make as well as to"
104,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"mirror, and with a taste naturally sound and manly, who should yet seek"
105,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to shock the feelings of the pious, to gratify the low tendencies, and"
106,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,fire to frenzy the evil passions of his period--he is not to be shielded
107,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,by the apology that he has only conformed to the bad age on which he was
108,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"so unfortunate as to fall. Prejudice may, indeed, put in such a plea in"
109,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his defence; but the inevitable eye of common sense, distinguishing"
110,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"between necessity and choice, between coarseness and corruption, between"
111,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,a man's passively yielding to and actively inviting and encouraging the
112,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"currents of false taste and immorality which he must encounter, will"
113,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"find that plea nugatory, and bring in against the author a verdict of"
114,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,guilty.
115,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
116,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Now this, we fear, is exactly the case of Dryden. He was neither a"
117,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""barbarian"" nor a ""Scythian."" He was a conscious artist, not a high"
118,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"though helpless reflector of his age. He had not, we think, like his"
119,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"relative, Swift, originally any diseased delight in filth for its own"
120,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sake; was not--shall we say?--a natural, but an artificial _Yahoo_. He"
121,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"wielded a power over the public mind, approaching the absolute, and"
122,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which he could have turned to virtuous, instead of vicious account--at"
123,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"first, it might have been amidst considerable resistance and obloquy,"
124,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"but ultimately with triumphant success. This, however, he never"
125,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"attempted, and must therefore be classed, in this respect, with such"
126,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"writers as Byron, whose powers gilded their pollutions, less than their"
127,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"pollutions degraded and defiled their powers; nay, perhaps he should be"
128,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"ranked even lower than the noble bard, whose obscenities are not so"
129,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"gross, and who had, besides, to account for them the double palliations"
130,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,of passion and of despair.
131,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
132,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"In these remarks we refer principally to Dryden's plays; for his poems,"
133,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"as we remarked in the Life, are (with the exception of a few of the"
134,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Prologues, which we print under protest) in a great measure free from"
135,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,impurity. We pass gladly to consider him in his genius and his poetical
136,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"works. The most obvious, and among the most remarkable characteristics"
137,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of his poetic style, are its wondrous elasticity and ease of movement."
138,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"There is never for an instant any real or apparent effort, any"
139,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"straining for effect, any of that ""double, double, toil and trouble,"" by"
140,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,which many even of the weird cauldrons in which Genius forms her
141,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,creations are disturbed and bedimmed. That power of doing everything
142,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with perfect and _conscious_ ease, which Dugald Stewart has ascribed to"
143,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Barrow and to Horsley in prose, distinguished Dryden in poetry. Whether"
144,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"he discusses the deep questions of fate and foreknowledge in ""Religio"
145,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Laici,"" or lashes Shaftesbury in the ""Medal,"" or pours a torrent of"
146,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"contempt on Shadwell in ""MacFlecknoe,"" or describes the fire of London"
147,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"in the ""Annus Mirabilis,"" or soars into lyric enthusiasm in his ""Ode on"
148,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the Death of Mrs Killigrew,"" and ""Alexander's Feast,"" or paints a"
149,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"tournament in ""Palamon and Arcite,"" or a fairy dance in the ""Flower and"
150,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the Leaf,""--he is always at home, and always aware that he is. His"
151,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,consciousness of his own powers amounts to exultation. He is like the
152,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,steed who glories in that tremendous gallop which affects the spectator
153,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with fear. Indeed, we never can separate our conception of Dryden's"
154,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"vigorous and vaulting style from the image of a noble horse, devouring"
155,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the dust of the field, clearing obstacles at a bound, taking up long"
156,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"leagues as a little thing, and the very strength and speed of whose"
157,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,motion give it at a distance the appearance of smoothness. Pope speaks
158,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,of his
159,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
160,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Long resounding march, and energy divine."""
161,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
162,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Perhaps ""_ease_ divine"" had been words more characteristic of that"
163,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,almost superhuman power of language by which he makes the most obstinate
164,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"materials pliant, melts down difficulties as if by the touch of magic,"
165,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and, to resume the former figure, comes into the goal without a hair"
166,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"turned on his mane, or a single sweat-drop confessing effort or"
167,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,extraordinary exertion. We know no poet since Homer who can be compared
168,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to Dryden in this respect, except Scott, who occasionally, in ""Marmion,"""
169,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" exhibits the same impetuous ease and"
170,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"fiery fluent movement. Scott does not, however, in general, carry the"
171,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"same weight as the other; and the species of verse he uses, in"
172,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"comparison to the heroic rhyme of Dryden, gives you often the impression"
173,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of a hard trot, rather than of a ""long-resounding"" and magnificent"
174,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,gallop. Scott exhibits in his poetry the soul of a warrior; but it is of
175,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"a warrior of the Border--somewhat savage and coarse. Dryden can, for the"
176,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"nonce at least, assume the appearance, and display the spirit, of a"
177,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"knight of ancient chivalry--gallant, accomplished, elegant, and gay."
178,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
179,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Next to this poet's astonishing ease, spirit, and elastic vigour, may be"
180,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"ranked his clear, sharp intellect. He may be called more a logician than"
181,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"a poet. He reasons often, and always acutely, and his rhyme, instead of"
182,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"shackling, strengthens the movement of his argumentation. Parts of his"
183,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Religio Laici"" and the ""Hind and Panther"" resemble portions of Duns"
184,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Scotus or Aquinas set on fire. Indeed, keen, strong intellect, inflamed"
185,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"with passion, and inspirited by that ""ardour and impetuosity of mind"""
186,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which Wordsworth is compelled to allow to him, rather than creative or"
187,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"original genius, is the differentia of Dryden. We have compared him to a"
188,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"courser, but he was not one of those coursers of Achilles, who fed on no"
189,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"earthly food, but on the golden barley of heaven, having sprung from the"
190,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,gods--
191,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
192,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"[Greek: Xanthon kai Balion, to ama pnoiaesi, petesthaen."
193,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Tous eteke Zephuro anemo Arpua Podargae.]
194,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
195,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Dryden resembled rather the mortal steed which was yoked with these
196,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"immortal twain, the brood of Zephyr and the Harpy Podarga; only we can"
197,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,hardly say of the poet what Homer says of Pedasus--
198,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
199,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"[Greek: Os kai thnaetos eon, epeth ippois athanatoisi.]"
200,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
201,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"He was _not_, although a mortal, able to keep up with the immortal"
202,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,coursers. His path was on the plains or table-lands of earth--never or
203,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"seldom in ""cloudland, gorgeous land,"" or through the aerial altitudes"
204,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,which stretch away and above the clouds to the gates of heaven. He can
205,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"hardly be said to have possessed the power of sublimity, in the high"
206,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sense of that term, as the power of sympathising with the feeling of the"
207,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Infinite. Often he gives us the impression of the picturesque, of the"
208,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"beautiful, of the heroic, of the nobly disdainful--but never (when"
209,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"writing, at least, entirely from his own mind) of that infinite and"
210,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,nameless grandeur which the imaginative soul feels shed on it from the
211,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"multitudinous waves of ocean--from the cataract leaping from his rock,"
212,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,as if to consummate an act of prayer to God--from the hum of great
213,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,assemblies of men--from the sight of far-extended wastes and
214,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"wildernesses--and from the awful silence, and the still more mysterious"
215,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,sparkle of the midnight stars. This sense of the presence of the
216,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,_shadow_ of immensity--immensity itself cannot be felt any more than
217,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"measured--this sight like that vouchsafed to Moses of the ""backparts"" of"
218,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the Divine--the Divine itself cannot be seen--has been the inspiration
219,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of all the highest poetry of the world--of the ""Paradise Lost,"" of the"
220,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Divina Commedia,"" of the ""Night Thoughts,"" of Wordsworth and Coleridge,"
221,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of ""Festus,"" and, highest far, of the Hebrew Prophets, as they cry,"
222,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Whither can we go from Thy presence? whither can we flee from Thy"
223,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Spirit?"" Such poets have resembled a blind man, who feels, although he"
224,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"cannot see, that a stranger of commanding air is in the room beside him;"
225,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"so they stand awe-struck in the ""wind of the going"" of a majestic and"
226,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"unseen Being. This feeling differs from mysticism, inasmuch as it is"
227,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"connected with a reality, while the mystic dreams a vague and"
228,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"unsupported dream, and the poetry it produces is simply the irresistible"
229,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,cry springing from the perception of this wondrous Some One who is
230,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"actually near them. The feeling is connected, in general, with a lofty"
231,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"moral and religious nature; and yet not always, since, while wanting in"
232,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden, we find it intensely discovered, although in an imperfect and"
233,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"perverted shape, in Byron and Rousseau."
234,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
235,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,In Dryden certainly it exists not. We do not--and in this we have
236,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Jeffrey's opinion to back us--remember a single line in his poetry that
237,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"can be called sublime, or, which is the same thing, that gives us a"
238,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"thrilling shudder, as if a god or a ghost were passing by. Pleasure,"
239,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"high excitement,--rapture even, he often produces; but such a feeling as"
240,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"is created by that line of Milton,"
241,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
242,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""To bellow through the vast and boundless deep,"""
243,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
244,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"never. Compare, in proof of this, the description of the tournament in"
245,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Palamon and Arcite""--amazingly spirited as it is--to the description of"
246,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the war-horse in Job; or, if that appear too high a test, to the"
247,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"contest of Achilles with the rivers in Homer; to the war of the Angels,"
248,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and the interrupted preparations for contest between Gabriel and Satan
249,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,in Milton; to the contest between Apollyon and Christian in the
250,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Pilgrim's Progress;"" to some of the combats in Spenser; and to that"
251,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"wonderful one of the Princess and the Magician in midair in the ""Arabian"
252,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Nights,"" in order to understand the distinction between the most"
253,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,animated literal pictures of battle and those into which the element of
254,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"imagination is strongly injected by the poet, who can, to the inevitable"
255,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"shiver of human nature at the sight of struggle and carnage, add the far"
256,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"more profound and terrible shiver, only created by a vision of the"
257,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"concomitants, the consequences--the UNSEEN BORDERS of the bloody scene."
258,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Take these lines, for instance:--"
259,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
260,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""They look anew: the beauteous form of fight"
261,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Is changed, and war appears a grisly sight;"
262,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Two troops in fair array one moment showed--
263,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"The next, a field with fallen bodies strowed;"
264,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Not half the number in their seats are found,"
265,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground.
266,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"The points of spears are stuck within the shield,"
267,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,The steeds without their riders scour the field;
268,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"The knights, unhorsed, on foot renew the fight--"
269,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,The glittering faulchions cast a gleaming light;
270,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Hauberks and helms are hew'd with many a wound,"
271,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Out-spins the streaming blood, and dyes the ground."""
272,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
273,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"This is vigorous and vivid, but is not imaginative or suggestive. It"
274,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,does not carry away the mind from the field to bring back thoughts and
275,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"images, which shall, so to speak, brood over, and aggravate the general"
276,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"horror. It is, in a word, plain, good painting, but it is not poetry."
277,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"There is not a metaphor, such as ""he _laugheth_ at the shaking of a"
278,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"spear,"" in it all."

280,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,In connexion with this defect in imagination is the lack of natural
281,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"imagery in Dryden's poetry. Wordsworth, indeed, greatly overcharges the"
282,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"case, when he says (in a letter to Scott), ""that there is not a single"
283,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"image from nature in the whole body of his poetry."" We have this minute"
284,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"taken up the ""Hind and the Panther,"" and find two images from nature in"
285,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,one page:--

299,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""New blossoms flourish and new flowers arise,"
300,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"As _God had been abroad_, and walking there,"

302,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
303,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Still it is true, that, taking his writings as a whole, they are thin in"
304,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"natural images; and even those which occur, are often rather the echoes"
305,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of his reading, than the results of his observation. And what Wordsworth"
306,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"adds is, we fear, true; in his translation of Virgil, where Virgil can"
307,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"be fairly said to have his eye upon his object, Dryden always spoils the"
308,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"passage. The reason of this, apart from his want of high imaginative"
309,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sympathy, may be found in his long residence in London; and his lack of"
310,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"that intimate daily familiarity with natural scenes, which can alone"
311,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"supply thorough knowledge, or enkindle thorough love. Nature is not like"
312,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the majority of other mistresses. Her charms deepen the longer she is
313,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"known; and he that loves her most warmly, has watched her with the"
314,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,narrowest inspection. She can bear the keenest glances of the
315,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"microscope, and to see all her glory would exhaust an antediluvian life."
316,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"The appetite, in her case, ""grows with what it feeds on;"" but such an"
317,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,appetite was not Dryden's.
318,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
319,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Another of his great defects is, in true tenderness of feeling. He has"
320,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,very few passages which can be called pathetic. His Elegies and funeral
321,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Odes, such as those on ""Mrs Killigrew"" and ""Eleonora,"" are eloquent; but"
322,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"they move you to admiration, not to tears. Dryden's long immersion in"
323,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the pollutions of the playhouses, had combined, with his long course of"
324,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"domestic infelicity, and his employments as a hack author, a party"
325,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"scribe, and a satirist, to harden his heart, to brush away whatever fine"
326,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"bloom of feeling there had been originally on his mind, and to render"
327,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,him incapable of even simulating the softer emotions of the soul. But
328,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"for the discovered fact, that he was in early life a lover of his"
329,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"relative, Honor Driden, you would have judged him from his works"
330,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"incapable of a pure passion. ""Lust hard by Hate,"" being his twin idols,"
331,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"how could he represent human, far less ethereal love; and how could he"
332,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"touch those springs of holy tears, which lie deep in man's heart, and"
333,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"which are connected with all that is dignified, and all that is divine"
334,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"in man's nature? What could the author of ""Limberham"" know of love, or"
335,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"the author of ""MacFlecknoe"" of pity?"
336,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
337,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Wordsworth, in that admirable letter to which we have repeatedly"
338,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"referred, says, ""Whenever his language is poetically impassioned, it is"
339,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"mostly upon unpleasing subjects, such as the follies, vices, and crimes"
340,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of classes of men, or individuals."" This is unquestionable. He never so"
341,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"nearly reaches the sublime, as when he is expressing contempt. He never"
342,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rises so high, as in the act of trampling. He is a ""good hater,"" and"
343,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"expresses his hatred with a mixture of _animus_ and ease, of fierceness"
344,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and of trenchant rapidity, which makes it very formidable. He only, as"
345,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"it were, waves off his adversaries disdainfully, but the very wave of"
346,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"his hand cuts like a sabre. His satire is not savage and furious, like"
347,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Juvenal's; not cool, collected, and infernal, like that of Junius; not"
348,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rabid and reckless, like that of Swift; and never darkens into the"
349,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"unearthly grandeur of Byron's: but it is strong, swift, dashing, and"
350,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,decisive. Nor does it want deep and subtle touches. His pictures of
351,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Shaftesbury and Buckingham are as delicately finished, as they are"
352,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,powerfully conceived. He flies best at the highest game; but even in
353,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"dealing with Settles and Shadwells, he can be as felicitous as he is"
354,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"fierce. No satire in the world contains lines more exquisitely inverted,"
355,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"more ingeniously burlesqued, more artfully turned out of their"
356,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"apparently proper course, like rays at once refracted and cooled, than"
357,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,those which thus ominously panegyrise Shadwell:--

359,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""His brows thick fogs, instead of glories grace,"
360,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,And _lambent dulness_ play'd about his face.

369,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""The Sire then shook the honours of his head,"
370,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,And from his brows damps of oblivion shed
371,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Full on the _filial dulness_--long he stood
372,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Repelling from his breast the _raging_ God."""
373,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
374,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,What inimitable irony in this epithet! The God of dulness _raging_! A
375,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"stagnant pool in a passion; a canal insane; a _mouton enragÃ©_, as the"
376,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"French says; or a snail in a tumultuous state of excitement, were but"
377,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,types of the satirical ideas implied in these words. What a description
378,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of labouring nonsense--of the Pythonic genius of absurdity, panting and"
379,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,heaving on his solemnly ridiculous tripod!
380,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
381,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"The language and versification of Dryden have been praised, and justly."
382,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,His style is worthy of a still more powerful and original vein of genius
383,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"than his own. It is a masculine, clear, elastic, and varied diction,"
384,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"fitted to express all feelings, save the deepest; all fancies, save the"
385,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"subtlest; all passions, save the loftiest; all moods of mind, save the"
386,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"most disinterested and rapt; to represent incidents, however strange;"
387,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"characters, however contradictory to each other; shades of meaning,"
388,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"however evasive: and to do all this, as if it were doing nothing, in"
389,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"point of ease, and as if it were doing everything in point of felt and"
390,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"rejoicing energy. No poetic style since can, in such respects, be"
391,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,compared to Dryden's. Pope's to his is feeble--and Byron's forced. He
392,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"can say the strongest things in the swiftest way, and the most"
393,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,felicitous expressions seem to fall unconsciously from his lips. Had his
394,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"matter, you say, but been equal to his manner, his thought in"
395,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,originality and imaginative power but commensurate with the boundless
396,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"quantity, and no less admirable quality, of his words! His versification"
397,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"deserves a commendation scarcely inferior. It is ""all ear,"" if we may so"
398,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"apply an expression of Shakspeare's. No studied rules,--no elaborate"
399,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"complication of harmonies,--it is the mere sinking and swelling of the"
400,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"wave of his thought as it moves onward to the shore of his purpose. And,"
401,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"as in the sea, there are no furrows absolutely isolated from each other,"
402,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"but each leans on, or melts into each, and the subsidence of the one is"
403,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the rise of the other--so with the versification of his better poetry.
404,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"The beginning of the ""Hind and Panther,"" we need not quote; but it will"
405,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"be remembered, as a good specimen of that peculiar style of running the"
406,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"lines into one another, and thereby producing a certain free and noble"
407,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"effect, which the uniform tinkle of Pope and his school is altogether"
408,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,unable to reach; a style which has since been copied by some of our
409,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"poets--by Churchill, by Cowper, and by Shelley. The lines of the"
410,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"artificial school, on the other hand, may be compared to _rollers_, each"
411,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"distinct from each other,--each being in itself a whole,--but altogether"
412,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"forming none. Pope, says Hazlitt, has turned Pegasus into a"
413,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,rocking-horse.
414,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
415,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"We are, perhaps, nearly right when we call Dryden the most _eloquent_"
416,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and _rhetorical_ of English poets. He bears in this respect an analogy
417,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"to Lucretius among the Romans, who, inferior in polish to Virgil, was"
418,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"incomparably more animated and energetic in style; who exhibited,"
419,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"besides, traits of lofty imagination rarely met with in Virgil, and"
420,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,never in Dryden; and who equalled the English poet in the power of
421,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"reasoning in verse, and setting the severe abstractions of metaphysical"
422,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"thought to music. With the Shakspeares, Chaucers, Spensers, Miltons,"
423,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Byrons, Wordsworths, and Coleridges, the _Dii majorum gentium_ of the"
424,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Poetic Pantheon of Britain, Dryden ranks not, although towering far"
425,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"above the Moores, Goldsmiths, Gays, and Priors. He may be classed with a"
426,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"middle, but still high order, in which we find the names of Scott, as a"
427,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"_poet_, Johnson, Pope, Cowper, Southey, Crabbe, and two or three others,"
428,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"who, while all excelling Dryden in some qualities, are all excelled by"
429,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"him in others, and bulk on the whole about as largely as he on the"
430,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,public eye.
431,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
432,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"We come to make a few remarks, in addition to some we have already"
433,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"incidentally made, on Dryden's separate works. And first of his Lyrics."
434,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"His songs, properly so called, are lively, buoyant, and elastic; yet,"
435,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"compared to those of Shakspeare, they are of ""the earth, earthy."" They"
436,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"are the down of the thistle, carried on a light breeze upwards."
437,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Shakspeare's resemble aerial notes--snatches of superhuman
438,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,melody--descending from above. Compared to the warm-gushing songs of
439,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Burns, Dryden's are cold. Better than his songs are his Odes. That on"
440,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the death of Mrs Killigrew has much divided the opinion of critics--Dr
441,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Johnson calling it magnificent, and Warton denying it any merit. We"
442,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,incline to a mediate view. It has bold passages; the first and the last
443,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"stanzas are very powerful, and the whole is full of that rushing"
444,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,torrent-movement characteristic of the poet. But the sinkings are as
445,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"deep as the swellings, and the inequality disturbs the general effect."
446,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"This is still more true of ""Threnodia Augustalis,"" the ode on the death"
447,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of Charles II. Not only is its spirit fulsome, and its statement of"
448,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"facts grossly partial, but many of its lines are feeble, and the whole"
449,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,is wire-spun. Yet what can be nobler in thought and language than the

456,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,

478,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of India, and attended by a procession of the lions and tigers he had"
479,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"tamed. But this, although a more imaginative representation of the god"
480,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"of wine, had not been so suitably sung at an entertainment presided over"
481,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"by an Alexander and a Thais, a drunk conqueror and a courtezan. Dryden"
482,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"himself, we have seen, thought this the best ode that ever was or would"
483,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,be written in the English language. In a certain sense he was right. For
484,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"vivacity, freedom of movement, and eloquence, it has never been"
485,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"equalled. But there are some odes--such as Coleridge's ""Ode to France"""
486,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and Wordsworth's ""Power of Sound""--which as certainly excel it in"
487,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"strength of imagination, grandeur of conception, and unity of execution"

527,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Dryden often was, there is something in this epistle that rings true,"
528,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,and the emotion in it you feel even all his powers could never have

532,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"nightshade, and pours its dark poison into the latest cup of existence."
533,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
534,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"His ""Annus Mirabilis"" is another instance of perverted power, and"
535,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,ingenuity astray. Written in that bad style he found prevalent in his
536,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"early days--the style of the metaphysical poets, Cowley, Donne, and"
537,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Drayton--the author ever and anon soars out of his trammels into strong
538,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"and simple poetry, fervid description, and in one passage--that about"
539,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the future fortunes of London--into eloquent prophecy. The fire of
540,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"London is vigorously pictured, but its breath of flame should have"
541,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,burned up petty conceit and tawdry ornament. He should have sternly
542,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,daguerreotyped the spectacle of the capital of the civilised world
543,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"burning--a spectacle awful, not only in the sight of men, but, as Hall"
544,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"says of the French Revolution, in that of superior beings. We need not"
545,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,dwell on the far-famed absurdities which the poem contains--about God
546,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"turning a ""crystal pyramid into a broad extinguisher"" to put out the"
547,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,fire--of the ship compared to a sea-wasp floating on the waves--and of
548,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"men in the fight killed by ""aromatic splinters"" from the Spice Islands!"
549,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Criticism has long ago said its best and its worst about these early
550,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"escapades of a writer whose taste, to the last, was never commensurate"
551,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,with his genius.
552,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
553,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"His Translations we have not included in this edition, as we reserve"
554,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"them, along with other masterpieces of translated verse, for a separate"
555,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"issue afterwards. That of the ""Art of Poetry,"" sometimes included in"
556,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"editions of his works, was not his, but only revised by him. We may say"
557,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"here, in general, however, that although there are more learned and more"
558,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"correct translators than Dryden, there are few who have produced"
559,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"versions so vigorous, so full of exuberant life, and, in those parts of"
560,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,the authors suitable to the peculiarities of the translator's own
561,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"genius, so faithful to their spirit and soul, if not to their letter and"
562,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"their body, as he. Parts of Virgil he does not translate well; he has no"
563,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"sympathy with Maro's elegance, _concinnitas_, chaste grandeur, and"
564,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,minute knowledge of nature; but wherever Virgil begins to glow and
565,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"gallop, Dryden glows and gallops with him; and wherever Virgil is"
566,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"nearest Homer, Dryden is nearest him."
567,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
568,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"We have reserved to the close his Fables, as, on the whole, forming the"
569,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"culmination of Dryden the artist, if not, perhaps, of Dryden the poet."
570,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"In preparing his poems for publication, how refreshing we found it to"
571,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"pass from a needful although cursory perusal of his plays, and a"
572,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"revision of his prologues, to these comparatively pure, right-manly, and"
573,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"eloquent compositions--the fables of Dryden! We do not, because it would"
574,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"be hardly fair, with Wordsworth, seek to compare them with the"
575,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,Chaucerian originals--a comparison under which they would be infallibly
576,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,crushed. We prefer looking at them as bearing only the relation to
577,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Chaucer which Macpherson's, did to the original, Ossian. And regarding"
578,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"them in this light, as adaptations, where the original author furnishes"
579,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"only the ground-work, they are surely masterpieces and models of"
580,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"composition, if not exemplars of creative power and genius. How free and"
581,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,majestic their numbers! How bold and buoyant their language! How
582,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"interesting the stories they tell! How perfect the preservation, and"
583,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"artful the presentment, of the various characters! What a fine"
584,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"chivalrous spirit breathes in ""Palamon and Arcite!"" What a soft yet"
585,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"purple, pure yet gorgeous, light of love hovers over the ""Flower and the"
586,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"Leaf!""--the only poem of Dryden's in which--thanks perhaps to his"
587,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"master, Chaucer--the poet discovers the slightest perception of that"
588,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
589,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"""Love which spirits feel"
590,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"In climes where all is equable and pure."""
591,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
592,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"What gay and gallant badinage, exquisite irony, and interesting"
593,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"narrative, in the story of ""The Cock and Fox!"" And what knowledge of"
594,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"human nature and skilful construction in ""The Wife of Bath's Tale!"" We"
595,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"are half inclined, with George Ellis, to call these fables the ""noblest"
596,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"specimen of versification to be found in any modern language."" We"
597,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"gather, too, from them a notion about Dryden's capabilities, which we"
598,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"may state. It is, that had Dryden lived in a novel and romance-writing"
599,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"age, and turned his great powers in that direction, he might have easily"
600,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,become the best fictionist--next to Cervantes and Scott--that ever
601,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"lived, possessing, as he did, most of the qualities of a good"
602,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,novelist--vigorous and facile diction; dramatic skill; an eye for
603,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"character; the power of graphic description, and rapid changeful"
604,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"narrative; the command of the grave and the gay, the severe and the"
605,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,lively; and a sympathy both with the bustling activities and the wild
606,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"romance of human life, if not with its more solemn aspects, its"
607,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,"transcendental references, and its aerial heights and giddy abysses of"
608,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,imagination and poetry.
609,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,
610,GENIUS AND POETICAL WORKS OF JOHN DRYDEN.,[We have followed the judicious example of Warton and Mitford in

2444,I.,"Thou youngest virgin-daughter of the skies,"
2445,I.,Made in the last promotion of the blest;
2446,I.,"Whose palms, new pluck'd from Paradise,"
2447,I.,"In spreading branches more sublimely rise,"
2448,I.,Rich with immortal green above the rest:
2449,I.,"Whether, adopted to some neighbouring star,"
2450,I.,"Thou roll'st above us, in thy wandering race,"
2451,I.,"Or, in procession fix'd and regular,"
2452,I.,Mov'st with the heavens' majestic pace;
2453,I.,"Or, call'd to more superior bliss,"
2454,I.,"Thou tread'st, with seraphims, the vast abyss:"
2455,I.,
2456,I.,"Whatever happy region is thy place,"
2457,I.,Cease thy celestial song a little space;
2458,I.,"Thou wilt have time enough for hymns divine,"
2459,I.,Since Heaven's eternal year is thine.
2460,I.,"Hear then a mortal Muse thy praise rehearse,"
2461,I.,In no ignoble verse;
2462,I.,"But such as thy own voice did practise here,"
2463,I.,When thy first fruits of Poesy were given;
2464,I.,To make thyself a welcome inmate there:
2465,I.,"While yet a young probationer,"
2466,I.,And candidate of heaven.
2467,I.,
2468,II.,II.
2469,II.,
2470,II.,"If by traduction came thy mind,"
2471,II.,Our wonder is the less to find
2472,II.,A soul so charming from a stock so good;
2473,II.,Thy father was transfused into thy blood:
2474,II.,"So wert thou born into a tuneful strain,"
2475,II.,"An early, rich, and inexhausted vein."
2476,II.,But if thy pre-existing soul
2477,II.,"Was form'd, at first, with myriads more,"
2478,II.,"It did through all the mighty poets roll,"
2479,II.,"Who Greek or Latin laurels wore,"
2480,II.,"And was that Sappho last, which once it was before."
2481,II.,"If so, then cease thy flight, O heaven-born mind!"
2482,II.,Thou hast no dross to purge from thy rich ore:
2483,II.,"Nor can thy soul a fairer mansion find,"
2484,II.,Than was the beauteous frame she left behind:
2485,II.,Return to fill or mend the choir of thy celestial kind.
2486,II.,
2487,III.,III.
2488,III.,
2489,III.,"May we presume to say, that, at thy birth,"
2490,III.,"New joy was sprung in heaven, as well as here on earth?"
2491,III.,
2492,III.,For sure the milder planets did combine
2493,III.,"On thy auspicious horoscope to shine,"
2494,III.,And even the most malicious were in trine.
2495,III.,Thy brother angels at thy birth
2496,III.,"Strung each his lyre, and tuned it high,"
2497,III.,That all the people of the sky
2498,III.,Might know a poetess was born on earth.
2499,III.,"And then, if ever, mortal ears"
2500,III.,"Had heard the music of the spheres,"
2501,III.,And if no clustering swarm of bees
2502,III.,"On thy sweet mouth distill'd their golden dew,"
2503,III.,'Twas that such vulgar miracles
2504,III.,Heaven had not leisure to renew:
2505,III.,For all thy blest fraternity of love
2506,III.,"Solemnized there thy birth, and kept thy holiday above."

2509,IV.,
2510,IV.,O gracious God! how far have we
2511,IV.,Profaned thy heavenly gift of Poesy!
2512,IV.,"Made prostitute and profligate the Muse,"
2513,IV.,"Debased to each obscene and impious use,"
2514,IV.,Whose harmony was first ordain'd above
2515,IV.,"For tongues of angels, and for hymns of love!"
2516,IV.,O wretched we! why were we hurried down
2517,IV.,"This lubrique and adulterate age,"
2518,IV.,"(Nay added fat pollutions of our own,)"
2519,IV.,To increase the streaming ordures of the stage?
2520,IV.,What can we say to excuse our second fall?
2521,IV.,"Let this thy vestal, Heaven, atone for all:"
2522,IV.,"Her Arethusian stream remains unsoil'd,"
2523,IV.,"Unmix'd with foreign filth, and undefiled:"
2524,IV.,"Her wit was more than man, her innocence a child."
2525,IV.,
2526,V.,V.
2527,V.,
2528,V.,"Art she had none, yet wanted none;"
2529,V.,For nature did that want supply:
2530,V.,"So rich in treasures of her own,"
2531,V.,She might our boasted stores defy:
2532,V.,"Such noble vigour did her verse adorn,"
2533,V.,That it seem'd borrow'd where 'twas only born.
2534,V.,Her morals too were in her bosom bred.
2535,V.,"By great examples daily fed,"
2536,V.,"What in the best of books, her father's life, she read:"
2537,V.,And to be read herself she need not fear;
2538,V.,"Each test, and every light, her Muse will bear,"
2539,V.,Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.
2540,V.,Even love (for love sometimes her Muse express'd)
2541,V.,Was but a lambent flame which play'd about her breast:
2542,V.,"Light as the vapours of a morning dream,"
2543,V.,"So cold herself, whilst she such warmth express'd,"
2544,V.,'Twas Cupid bathing in Diana's stream.
2545,V.,
2546,VI.,VI.
2547,VI.,
2548,VI.,"Born to the spacious empire of the Nine,"
2549,VI.,One would have thought she should have been content
2550,VI.,To manage well that mighty government;
2551,VI.,But what can young ambitious souls confine?
2552,VI.,"To the next realm she stretch'd her sway,"
2553,VI.,"For Painture near adjoining lay,"
2554,VI.,"A plenteous province, and alluring prey."
2555,VI.,"A Chamber of Dependencies was framed,"
2556,VI.,"(As conquerors will never want pretence,"
2557,VI.,"When arm'd, to justify the offence)"
2558,VI.,"And the whole fief, in right of poetry, she claim'd."
2559,VI.,The country open lay without defence:
2560,VI.,
2561,VI.,"For poets frequent inroads there had made,"
2562,VI.,And perfectly could represent
2563,VI.,"The shape, the face, with every lineament,"
2564,VI.,And all the large domains which the Dumb Sister sway'd;
2565,VI.,"All bow'd beneath her government,"
2566,VI.,Received in triumph wheresoe'er she went.
2567,VI.,"Her pencil drew whate'er her soul design'd,"
2568,VI.,And oft the happy draft surpass'd the image in her mind.
2569,VI.,"The sylvan scenes of herds and flocks,"
2570,VI.,"And fruitful plains and barren rocks,"
2571,VI.,"Of shallow brooks that flow'd so clear,"
2572,VI.,The bottom did the top appear:
2573,VI.,"Of deeper, too, and ampler floods,"
2574,VI.,"Which, as in mirrors, show'd the woods;"
2575,VI.,"Of lofty trees, with sacred shades,"
2576,VI.,"And pÃ©rspectives of pleasant glades,"
2577,VI.,"Where nymphs of brightest form appear,"
2578,VI.,"And shaggy satyrs standing near,"
2579,VI.,Which them at once admire and fear.
2580,VI.,"The ruins, too, of some majestic piece,"
2581,VI.,"Boasting the power of ancient Rome or Greece,"
2582,VI.,"Whose statues, friezes, columns broken lie,"
2583,VI.,"And, though defaced, the wonder of the eye;"
2584,VI.,"What nature, art, bold fiction e'er durst frame,"
2585,VI.,Her forming hand gave feature to the name.
2586,VI.,"So strange a concourse ne'er was seen before,"
2587,VI.,But when the peopled ark the whole creation bore.
2588,VI.,
2589,VII.,VII.
2590,VII.,
2591,VII.,The scene then changed: with bold erected look
2592,VII.,Our martial king the sight with reverence strook:
2593,VII.,"For not content to express his outward part,"
2594,VII.,Her hand call'd out the image of his heart:
2595,VII.,
2596,VII.,"His warlike mind, his soul devoid of fear,"
2597,VII.,"His high-designing thoughts were figured there,"
2598,VII.,"As when, by magic, ghosts are made appear."
2599,VII.,"Our phoenix queen was portray'd too so bright,"
2600,VII.,Beauty alone could beauty take so right;
2601,VII.,"Her dress, her shape, her matchless grace,"
2602,VII.,"Were all observed, as well as heavenly face."
2603,VII.,"With such a peerless majesty she stands,"
2604,VII.,As in that day she took the crown from sacred hands:
2605,VII.,"Before a train of heroines was seen,"
2606,VII.,"In beauty foremost, as in rank, the queen."
2607,VII.,"Thus nothing to her genius was denied,"
2608,VII.,"But like a ball of fire the further thrown,"
2609,VII.,"Still with a greater blaze she shone,"
2610,VII.,And her bright soul broke out on every side.
2611,VII.,What next she had design'd Heaven only knows:
2612,VII.,"To such immoderate growth her conquest rose,"
2613,VII.,That fate alone its progress could oppose.
2614,VII.,
2615,VIII.,VIII.
2616,VIII.,
2617,VIII.,"Now all those charms, that blooming grace,"
2618,VIII.,"The well-proportion'd shape, and beauteous face,"
2619,VIII.,Shall never more be seen by mortal eyes;
2620,VIII.,In earth the much lamented virgin lies.
2621,VIII.,"Not wit, nor piety could Fate prevent;"
2622,VIII.,Nor was the cruel destiny content
2623,VIII.,"To finish all the murder at a blow,"
2624,VIII.,"To sweep at once her life, and beauty too;"
2625,VIII.,"But, like a harden'd felon, took a pride"
2626,VIII.,"To work more mischievously slow,"
2627,VIII.,"And plunder'd first, and then destroy'd."
2628,VIII.,"Oh, double sacrilege on things divine,"
2629,VIII.,"To rob the relic, and deface the shrine!"
2630,VIII.,
2631,VIII.,But thus Orinda[35] died:
2632,VIII.,"Heaven, by the same disease, did both translate:"
2633,VIII.,"As equal were their souls, so equal was their fate."

2636,IX.,
2637,IX.,Meantime her warlike brother on the seas
2638,IX.,"His waving streamers to the wind displays,"
2639,IX.,"And vows for his return, with vain devotion, pays."
2640,IX.,"Ah, generous youth! that wish forbear,"
2641,IX.,The winds too soon will waft thee here:
2642,IX.,"Slack all thy sails, and fear to come,"
2643,IX.,"Alas, thou know'st not thou art wreck'd at home!"
2644,IX.,"No more shalt thou behold thy sister's face,"
2645,IX.,Thou hast already had her last embrace.
2646,IX.,"But look aloft, and if thou ken'st from far"
2647,IX.,"Among the Pleiads a new-kindled star,"
2648,IX.,"If any sparkles than the rest more bright,"
2649,IX.,'Tis she that shines in that propitious light.

2723,ABINGDON.,"MY LORD,--The commands, with which you honoured me some months ago, are"
2724,ABINGDON.,"now performed: they had been sooner; but betwixt ill health, some"
2725,ABINGDON.,"business, and many troubles, I was forced to defer them till this time."
2726,ABINGDON.,"Ovid, going to his banishment, and writing from on shipboard to his"
2727,ABINGDON.,"friends, excused the faults of his poetry by his misfortunes; and told"
2728,ABINGDON.,"them, that good verses never flow but from a serene and composed spirit."
2729,ABINGDON.,"Wit, which is a kind of Mercury, with wings fastened to his head and"
2730,ABINGDON.,"heels, can fly but slowly in a damp air. I therefore chose rather to"
2731,ABINGDON.,"obey you late than ill: if at least I am capable of writing anything, at"
2732,ABINGDON.,"any time, which is worthy your perusal and your patronage. I cannot say"
2733,ABINGDON.,that I have escaped from a shipwreck; but have only gained a rock by
2734,ABINGDON.,"hard swimming, where I may pant a while and gather breath: for the"
2735,ABINGDON.,"doctors give me a sad assurance, that my disease never took its leave of"
2736,ABINGDON.,"any man, but with a purpose to return. However, my lord, I have laid"
2737,ABINGDON.,"hold on the interval, and managed the small stock, which age has left"
2738,ABINGDON.,"me, to the best advantage, in performing this inconsiderable service to"
2739,ABINGDON.,"my lady's memory. We, who are priests of Apollo, have not the"
2740,ABINGDON.,inspiration when we please; but must wait until the god comes rushing on
2741,ABINGDON.,"us, and invades us with a fury which we are not able to resist: which"
2742,ABINGDON.,"gives us double strength while the fit continues, and leaves us"
2743,ABINGDON.,"languishing and spent at its departure. Let me not seem to boast, my"
2744,ABINGDON.,"lord, for I have really felt it on this occasion, and prophesied beyond"
2745,ABINGDON.,"my natural power. Let me add, and hope to be believed, that the"
2746,ABINGDON.,excellency of the subject contributed much to the happiness of the
2747,ABINGDON.,execution; and that the weight of thirty years was taken off me while I
2748,ABINGDON.,"was writing. I swam with the tide, and the water under me was buoyant."
2749,ABINGDON.,The reader will easily observe that I was transported by the multitude
2750,ABINGDON.,and variety of my similitudes; which are generally the product of a
2751,ABINGDON.,"luxuriant fancy, and the wantonness of wit. Had I called in my judgment"
2752,ABINGDON.,"to my assistance, I had certainly retrenched many of them. But I defend"
2753,ABINGDON.,them not; let them pass for beautiful faults amongst the better sort of
2754,ABINGDON.,"critics: for the whole poem, though written in that which they call"
2755,ABINGDON.,"Heroic verse, is of the Pindaric nature, as well in the thought as the"
2756,ABINGDON.,"expression; and, as such, requires the same grains of allowance for it."
2757,ABINGDON.,"It was intended, as your lordship sees in the title, not for an elegy,"
2758,ABINGDON.,"but a panegyric: a kind of apotheosis, indeed, if a heathen word may be"
2759,ABINGDON.,"applied to a Christian use. And on all occasions of praise, if we take"
2760,ABINGDON.,"the ancients for our patterns, we are bound by prescription to employ"
2761,ABINGDON.,"the magnificence of words, and the force of figures, to adorn the"
2762,ABINGDON.,"sublimity of thoughts. Isocrates amongst the Grecian orators, and"
2763,ABINGDON.,"Cicero, and the younger Pliny, amongst the Romans, have left us their"
2764,ABINGDON.,precedents for our security; for I think I need not mention the
2765,ABINGDON.,"inimitable Pindar, who stretches on these pinions out of sight, and is"
2766,ABINGDON.,"carried upward, as it were, into another world."
2767,ABINGDON.,
2768,ABINGDON.,"This, at least, my lord, I may justly plead, that if I have not"
2769,ABINGDON.,"performed so well as I think I have, yet I have used my best endeavours"
2770,ABINGDON.,"to excel myself. One disadvantage I have had; which is, never to have"
2771,ABINGDON.,"known or seen my lady: and to draw the lineaments of her mind, from the"
2772,ABINGDON.,"description which I have received from others, is for a painter to set"
2773,ABINGDON.,"himself at work without the living original before him: which, the more"
2774,ABINGDON.,"beautiful it is, will be so much the more difficult for him to conceive,"
2775,ABINGDON.,when he has only a relation given him of such and such features by an
2776,ABINGDON.,"acquaintance or a friend, without the nice touches, which give the best"
2777,ABINGDON.,"resemblance, and make the graces of the picture. Every artist is apt"
2778,ABINGDON.,enough to flatter himself (and I amongst the rest) that their own ocular
2779,ABINGDON.,"observations would have discovered more perfections, at least others,"
2780,ABINGDON.,than have been delivered to them: though I have received mine from the
2781,ABINGDON.,"best hands, that is, from persons who neither want a just understanding"
2782,ABINGDON.,"of my lady's worth, nor a due veneration for her memory."
2783,ABINGDON.,
2784,ABINGDON.,"Dr Donne, the greatest wit, though not the greatest poet of our nation,"
2785,ABINGDON.,"acknowledges, that he had never seen Mrs Drury, whom he has made"
2786,ABINGDON.,"immortal in his admirable ""Anniversaries."" I have had the same fortune,"
2787,ABINGDON.,"though I have not succeeded to the same genius. However, I have followed"
2788,ABINGDON.,his footsteps in the design of his panegyric; which was to raise an
2789,ABINGDON.,"emulation in the living, to copy out the example of the dead. And"
2790,ABINGDON.,"therefore it was, that I once intended to have called this poem ""The"
2791,ABINGDON.,"Pattern:"" and though, on a second consideration, I changed the title"
2792,ABINGDON.,"into the name of the illustrious person, yet the design continues, and"
2793,ABINGDON.,"Eleonora is still the pattern of charity, devotion, and humility; of the"
2794,ABINGDON.,"best wife, the best mother, and the best of friends."
2795,ABINGDON.,
2796,ABINGDON.,"And now, my lord, though I have endeavoured to answer your commands; yet"
2797,ABINGDON.,"I could not answer it to the world, nor to my conscience, if I gave not"
2798,ABINGDON.,your lordship my testimony of being the best husband now living: I say
2799,ABINGDON.,my testimony only; for the praise of it is given you by yourself. They
2800,ABINGDON.,"who despise the rules of virtue both in their practice and their morals,"
2801,ABINGDON.,will think this a very trivial commendation. But I think it the peculiar
2802,ABINGDON.,happiness of the Countess of Abingdon to have been so truly loved by you
2803,ABINGDON.,"while she was living, and so gratefully honoured after she was dead. Few"
2804,ABINGDON.,"there are who have either had, or could have, such a loss; and yet fewer"
2805,ABINGDON.,who carried their love and constancy beyond the grave. The exteriors of
2806,ABINGDON.,"mourning, a decent funeral, and black habits, are the usual stints of"
2807,ABINGDON.,common husbands: and perhaps their wives deserve no better than to be
2808,ABINGDON.,"mourned with hypocrisy, and forgot with ease. But you have distinguished"
2809,ABINGDON.,"yourself from ordinary lovers, by a real and lasting grief for the"
2810,ABINGDON.,deceased; and by endeavouring to raise for her the most durable
2811,ABINGDON.,"monument, which is that of verse. And so it would have proved, if the"
2812,ABINGDON.,"workman had been equal to the work, and your choice of the artificer as"
2813,ABINGDON.,"happy as your design. Yet, as Phidias, when he had made the statue of"
2814,ABINGDON.,"Minerva, could not forbear to engrave his own name, as author of the"
2815,ABINGDON.,"piece: so give me leave to hope, that, by subscribing mine to this poem,"
2816,ABINGDON.,"I may live by the goddess, and transmit my name to posterity by the"
2817,ABINGDON.,"memory of hers. It is no flattery to assure your lordship, that she is"
2818,ABINGDON.,"remembered, in the present age, by all who have had the honour of her"
2819,ABINGDON.,conversation and acquaintance; and that I have never been in any company
2820,ABINGDON.,"since the news of her death was first brought me, where they have not"
2821,ABINGDON.,"extolled her virtues, and even spoken the same things of her in prose,"
2822,ABINGDON.,which I have done in verse.
2823,ABINGDON.,
2824,ABINGDON.,I therefore think myself obliged to thank your lordship for the
2825,ABINGDON.,"commission which you have given me: how I have acquitted myself of it,"
2826,ABINGDON.,"must be left to the opinion of the world, in spite of any protestation"
2827,ABINGDON.,"which I can enter against the present age, as incompetent or corrupt"
2828,ABINGDON.,"judges. For my comfort, they are but Englishmen, and, as such, if they"
2829,ABINGDON.,"think ill of me to-day, they are inconstant enough to think well of me"
2830,ABINGDON.,"to-morrow. And after all, I have not much to thank my fortune that I was"
2831,ABINGDON.,"born amongst them. The good of both sexes are so few, in England, that"
2832,ABINGDON.,they stand like exceptions against general rules: and though one of them
2833,ABINGDON.,"has deserved a greater commendation than I could give her, they have"
2834,ABINGDON.,taken care that I should not tire my pen with frequent exercise on the
2835,ABINGDON.,"like subjects; that praises, like taxes, should be appropriated, and"
2836,ABINGDON.,"left almost as individual as the person. They say, my talent is satire:"
2837,ABINGDON.,"if it be so, it is a fruitful age, and there is an extraordinary crop to"
2838,ABINGDON.,gather. But a single hand is insufficient for such a harvest: they have
2839,ABINGDON.,"sown the dragons' teeth themselves, and it is but just they should reap"
2840,ABINGDON.,"each other in lampoons. You, my lord, who have the character of honour,"
2841,ABINGDON.,"though it is not my happiness to know you, may stand aside, with the"
2842,ABINGDON.,"small remainders of the English nobility, truly such, and, unhurt"
2843,ABINGDON.,"yourselves, behold the mad combat. If I have pleased you and some few"
2844,ABINGDON.,"others, I have obtained my end. You see I have disabled myself, like an"
2845,ABINGDON.,"elected speaker of the house: yet like him I have undertaken the charge,"
2846,ABINGDON.,and find the burden sufficiently recompensed by the honour. Be pleased
2847,ABINGDON.,"to accept of these my unworthy labours, this paper-monument; and let her"
2848,ABINGDON.,"pious memory, which I am sure is sacred to you, not only plead the"
2849,ABINGDON.,"pardon of my many faults, but gain me your protection, which is"
2850,ABINGDON.,"ambitiously sought by, my lord, your lordship's most obedient servant,"

2885,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Nor did her alms from ostentation fall,"

2888,JOHN DRYDEN.,No less than heaven--to heap huge treasures there.

2900,JOHN DRYDEN.,A future cordial for a fainting mind;
2901,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For, what was ne'er refused, all hoped to find,"

2906,JOHN DRYDEN.,Want and diseases fled before her name.
2907,JOHN DRYDEN.,For zeal like her's her servants were too slow;

2919,JOHN DRYDEN.,Where all the deeds of charity and love                             60
2920,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Were, in as constant method as above,"
2921,JOHN DRYDEN.,All carried on; all of a piece with theirs;

2942,JOHN DRYDEN.,Of which our earthly dunghill is the worst.

2944,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Now, as all virtues keep the middle line,"
2945,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Yet somewhat more to one extreme incline,"

2947,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Bounteous, but almost bounteous to a vice:"
2948,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Had she given more, it had profusion been,"

2951,JOHN DRYDEN.,These virtues raised her fabric to the sky;

2966,JOHN DRYDEN.,Ascribed above their due to every one--
2967,JOHN DRYDEN.,Unjust and scanty to herself alone.
2968,JOHN DRYDEN.,
2969,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Such her devotion was, as might give rules"

2988,JOHN DRYDEN.,(For such vicissitudes in heaven there are)
2989,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In praise alternate, and alternate prayer."
2990,JOHN DRYDEN.,All this she practised here; that when she sprung
2991,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Amidst the choirs, at the first sight she sung:"
2992,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Sung, and was sung herself in angels' lays;"
2993,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For, praising her, they did her Maker praise."

3003,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So let us view her, here, in what she was,"
3004,JOHN DRYDEN.,And take her image in this watery glass:
3005,JOHN DRYDEN.,Yet look not every lineament to see;                               140
3006,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Some will be cast in shades, and some will be"
3007,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So lamely drawn, you'll scarcely know 'tis she."

3015,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Though 'tis a train of stars, that, rolling on,"
3016,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Rise in their turn, and in the zodiac run:                         150"
3017,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Ever in motion; now 'tis faith ascends,"
3018,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Now hope, now charity, that upward tends,"
3019,JOHN DRYDEN.,And downwards with diffusive good descends.
3020,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3021,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As in perfumes composed with art and cost,"

3029,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For she was all, in that supreme degree,"
3030,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That as no one prevail'd, so all was she."
3031,JOHN DRYDEN.,The several parts lay hidden in the piece;
3032,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The occasion but exerted that, or this."

3034,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A wife as tender, and as true withal,"
3035,JOHN DRYDEN.,As the first woman was before her fall:
3036,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Made for the man, of whom she was a part;"
3037,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Made to attract his eyes, and keep his heart."
3038,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A second Eve, but by no crime accursed;                            170"
3039,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As beauteous, not as brittle, as the first:"
3040,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Had she been first, still Paradise had been,"
3041,JOHN DRYDEN.,And Death had found no entrance by her sin:
3042,JOHN DRYDEN.,So she not only had preserved from ill
3043,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Her sex and ours, but lived their pattern still."
3044,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3045,JOHN DRYDEN.,Love and obedience to her lord she bore;
3046,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She much obey'd him, but she loved him more:"
3047,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Not awed to duty by superior sway,"
3048,JOHN DRYDEN.,But taught by his indulgence to obey.
3049,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus we love God, as author of our good;                           180"
3050,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So subjects love just kings, or so they should."
3051,JOHN DRYDEN.,Nor was it with ingratitude return'd;
3052,JOHN DRYDEN.,In equal fires the blissful couple burn'd;
3053,JOHN DRYDEN.,"One joy possess'd them both, and in one grief they mourn'd."
3054,JOHN DRYDEN.,His passion still improved; he loved so fast
3055,JOHN DRYDEN.,As if he fear'd each day would be her last.
3056,JOHN DRYDEN.,Too true a prophet to foresee the fate
3057,JOHN DRYDEN.,That should so soon divide their happy state;
3058,JOHN DRYDEN.,When he to heaven entirely must restore
3059,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That love, that heart, where he went halves before.                190"
3060,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Yet as the soul is all in every part,"
3061,JOHN DRYDEN.,So God and he might each have all her heart.
3062,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3063,JOHN DRYDEN.,So had her children too; for charity
3064,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Was not more fruitful, or more kind than she:"
3065,JOHN DRYDEN.,Each under other by degrees they grew;
3066,JOHN DRYDEN.,A goodly perspective of distant view.
3067,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Anchises look'd not with so pleased a face,"
3068,JOHN DRYDEN.,"In numbering o'er his future Roman race,"
3069,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And marshalling the heroes of his name,"
3070,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As, in their order, next to light they came.                       200"
3071,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Nor Cybele, with half so kind an eye,"
3072,JOHN DRYDEN.,Survey'd her sons and daughters of the sky;
3073,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Proud, shall I say, of her immortal fruit?"
3074,JOHN DRYDEN.,As far as pride with heavenly minds may suit.
3075,JOHN DRYDEN.,Her pious love excell'd to all she bore;
3076,JOHN DRYDEN.,New objects only multiplied it more.
3077,JOHN DRYDEN.,And as the chosen found the pearly grain
3078,JOHN DRYDEN.,As much as every vessel could contain;
3079,JOHN DRYDEN.,As in the blissful vision each shall share
3080,JOHN DRYDEN.,As much of glory as his soul can bear;                             210
3081,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So did she love, and so dispense her care."
3082,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Her eldest thus, by consequence, was best,"
3083,JOHN DRYDEN.,As longer cultivated than the rest.
3084,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The babe had all that infant care beguiles,"
3085,JOHN DRYDEN.,And early knew his mother in her smiles:
3086,JOHN DRYDEN.,But when dilated organs let in day
3087,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To the young soul, and gave it room to play,"
3088,JOHN DRYDEN.,"At his first aptness, the maternal love"
3089,JOHN DRYDEN.,Those rudiments of reason did improve:
3090,JOHN DRYDEN.,The tender age was pliant to command;                              220
3091,JOHN DRYDEN.,Like wax it yielded to the forming hand:
3092,JOHN DRYDEN.,"True to the artificer, the labour'd mind"
3093,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With ease was pious, generous, just, and kind;"
3094,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Soft for impression, from the first prepared,"
3095,JOHN DRYDEN.,Till virtue with long exercise grew hard:
3096,JOHN DRYDEN.,"With every act confirm'd, and made at last"
3097,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So durable as not to be effaced,"
3098,JOHN DRYDEN.,"It turn'd to habit; and, from vices free,"
3099,JOHN DRYDEN.,Goodness resolved into necessity.
3100,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3101,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thus fix'd she virtue's image, that's her own,                   230"
3102,JOHN DRYDEN.,Till the whole mother in the children shone;
3103,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For that was their perfection: she was such,"
3104,JOHN DRYDEN.,They never could express her mind too much.
3105,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So unexhausted her perfections were,"
3106,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That, for more children, she had more to spare;"
3107,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For souls unborn, whom her untimely death"
3108,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Deprived of bodies, and of mortal breath;"
3109,JOHN DRYDEN.,And (could they take the impressions of her mind)
3110,JOHN DRYDEN.,Enough still left to sanctify her kind.
3111,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3112,JOHN DRYDEN.,Then wonder not to see this soul extend                          240
3113,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The bounds, and seek some other self, a friend:"
3114,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As swelling seas to gentle rivers glide,"
3115,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To seek repose, and empty out the tide;"
3116,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So this full soul, in narrow limits pent,"
3117,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Unable to contain her, sought a vent"
3118,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To issue out, and in some friendly breast"
3119,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Discharge her treasures, and securely rest:"
3120,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To unbosom all the secrets of her heart,"
3121,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Take good advice, but better to impart:"
3122,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For 'tis the bliss of friendship's holy state,                     250"
3123,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To mix their minds, and to communicate;"
3124,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Though bodies cannot, souls can penetrate."
3125,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Fix'd to her choice, inviolably true,"
3126,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And wisely choosing, for she chose but few."
3127,JOHN DRYDEN.,Some she must have; but in no one could find
3128,JOHN DRYDEN.,A tally fitted for so large a mind.
3129,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3130,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The souls of friends, like kings in progress, are"
3131,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Still in their own, though from the palace far:"
3132,JOHN DRYDEN.,Thus her friend's heart her country dwelling was
3133,JOHN DRYDEN.,A sweet retirement to a coarser place;                             260
3134,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where pomp and ceremonies enter'd not,"
3135,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where greatness was shut out, and business well forgot."
3136,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3137,JOHN DRYDEN.,This is the imperfect draught; but short as far
3138,JOHN DRYDEN.,As the true height and bigness of a star
3139,JOHN DRYDEN.,Exceeds the measures of the astronomer.
3140,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She shines above, we know; but in what place,"
3141,JOHN DRYDEN.,"How near the throne, and Heaven's imperial face,"
3142,JOHN DRYDEN.,By our weak optics is but vainly guess'd;
3143,JOHN DRYDEN.,Distance and altitude conceal the rest.
3144,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3145,JOHN DRYDEN.,Though all these rare endowments of the mind                     270
3146,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Were in a narrow space of life confined,"
3147,JOHN DRYDEN.,The figure was with full perfection crown'd;
3148,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Though not so large an orb, as truly round."
3149,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3150,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As when in glory, through the public place,"
3151,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The spoils of conquer'd nations were to pass,"
3152,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And but one day for triumph was allow'd,"
3153,JOHN DRYDEN.,The consul was constrain'd his pomp to crowd;
3154,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And so the swift procession hurried on,"
3155,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That all, though not distinctly, might be shown:"
3156,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So in the straiten'd bounds of life confined,                      280"
3157,JOHN DRYDEN.,She gave but glimpses of her glorious mind:
3158,JOHN DRYDEN.,And multitudes of virtues pass'd along;
3159,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Bach pressing foremost in the mighty throng,"
3160,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Ambitious to be seen, and then make room"
3161,JOHN DRYDEN.,For greater multitudes that were to come.
3162,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3163,JOHN DRYDEN.,Yet unemploy'd no minute slipp'd away;
3164,JOHN DRYDEN.,Moments were precious in so short a stay.
3165,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The haste of heaven to have her was so great,"
3166,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That some were single acts, though each complete;"
3167,JOHN DRYDEN.,But every act stood ready to repeat.                               290
3168,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3169,JOHN DRYDEN.,Her fellow-saints with busy care will look
3170,JOHN DRYDEN.,For her bless'd name in Fate's eternal book;
3171,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, pleased to be outdone, with joy will see"
3172,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Numberless virtues, endless charity:"
3173,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But more will wonder at so short an age,"
3174,JOHN DRYDEN.,To find a blank beyond the thirtieth page;
3175,JOHN DRYDEN.,And with a pious fear begin to doubt
3176,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The piece imperfect, and the rest torn out."
3177,JOHN DRYDEN.,"But 'twas her Saviour's time; and, could there be"
3178,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A copy near the Original, 'twas she.                                300"
3179,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3180,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As precious gums are not for lasting fire,"
3181,JOHN DRYDEN.,"They but perfume the temple, and expire:"
3182,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So was she soon exhaled, and vanish'd hence;"
3183,JOHN DRYDEN.,"A short sweet odour, of a vast expense."
3184,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She vanish'd, we can scarcely say she died;"
3185,JOHN DRYDEN.,For but a now did heaven and earth divide:
3186,JOHN DRYDEN.,She pass'd serenely with a single breath;
3187,JOHN DRYDEN.,"This moment perfect health, the next was death:"
3188,JOHN DRYDEN.,One sigh did her eternal bliss assure;
3189,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So little penance needs, when souls are almost pure.               310"
3190,JOHN DRYDEN.,As gentle dreams our waking thoughts pursue;
3191,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or, one dream pass'd, we slide into a new;"
3192,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So close they follow, such wild order keep,"
3193,JOHN DRYDEN.,"We think ourselves awake, and are asleep:"
3194,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So softly death succeeded life in her,"
3195,JOHN DRYDEN.,"She did but dream of heaven, and she was there."
3196,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3197,JOHN DRYDEN.,"No pains she suffer'd, nor expired with noise;"
3198,JOHN DRYDEN.,Her soul was whisper'd out with God's still voice;
3199,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As an old friend is beckon'd to a feast,"
3200,JOHN DRYDEN.,And treated like a long-familiar guest.                            320
3201,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He took her as He found, but found her so,"
3202,JOHN DRYDEN.,As one in hourly readiness to go:
3203,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Even on that day, in all her trim prepared;"
3204,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As early notice she from heaven had heard,"
3205,JOHN DRYDEN.,And some descending courier from above
3206,JOHN DRYDEN.,Had given her timely warning to remove;
3207,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or counsell'd her to dress the nuptial room,"
3208,JOHN DRYDEN.,For on that night the Bridegroom was to come.
3209,JOHN DRYDEN.,"He kept His hour, and found her where she lay"
3210,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Clothed all in white, the livery of the day.                       330"
3211,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Scarce had she sinn'd in thought, or word, or act;"
3212,JOHN DRYDEN.,Unless omissions were to pass for fact:
3213,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That hardly death a consequence could draw,"
3214,JOHN DRYDEN.,To make her liable to nature's law:
3215,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, that she died, we only have to show"
3216,JOHN DRYDEN.,The mortal part of her she left below:
3217,JOHN DRYDEN.,"The rest, so smooth, so suddenly she went,"
3218,JOHN DRYDEN.,Look'd like translation through the firmament;
3219,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or, like the fiery car, on the third errand[37] sent."
3220,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3221,JOHN DRYDEN.,"O happy soul! if thou canst view from high,                      340"
3222,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where thou art all intelligence, all eye;"
3223,JOHN DRYDEN.,"If, looking up to God, or down to us,"
3224,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thou find'st that any way be pervious,"
3225,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Survey the ruins of thy house, and see"
3226,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Thy widow'd, and thy orphan family:"
3227,JOHN DRYDEN.,Look on thy tender pledges left behind;
3228,JOHN DRYDEN.,"And, if thou canst a vacant minute find"
3229,JOHN DRYDEN.,"From heavenly joys, that interval afford"
3230,JOHN DRYDEN.,"To thy sad children, and thy mourning lord."
3231,JOHN DRYDEN.,"See how they grieve, mistaken in their love,                       350"
3232,JOHN DRYDEN.,And shed a beam of comfort from above;
3233,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Give them, as much as mortal eyes can bear,"
3234,JOHN DRYDEN.,A transient view of thy full glories there;
3235,JOHN DRYDEN.,That they with moderate sorrow may sustain
3236,JOHN DRYDEN.,And mollify their losses in thy gain:
3237,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Or else divide the grief; for such thou wert,"
3238,JOHN DRYDEN.,"That should not all relations bear a part,"
3239,JOHN DRYDEN.,It were enough to break a single heart.
3240,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3241,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Let this suffice: nor thou, great saint, refuse"
3242,JOHN DRYDEN.,This humble tribute of no vulgar Muse:                             360
3243,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Who, not by cares, or wants, or age depress'd,"
3244,JOHN DRYDEN.,Stems a wild deluge with a dauntless breast;
3245,JOHN DRYDEN.,And dares to sing thy praises in a clime
3246,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where vice triumphs, and virtue is a crime;"
3247,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Where even to draw the picture of thy mind,"
3248,JOHN DRYDEN.,Is satire on the most of human kind:
3249,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Take it, while yet 'tis praise; before my rage,"
3250,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Unsafely just, break loose on this bad age;"
3251,JOHN DRYDEN.,"So bad, that thou thyself hadst no defence"
3252,JOHN DRYDEN.,"From vice, but barely by departing hence.                          370"
3253,JOHN DRYDEN.,
3254,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Be what, and where thou art: to wish thy place,"
3255,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Were, in the best, presumption more than grace."
3256,JOHN DRYDEN.,Thy relics (such thy works of mercy are)
3257,JOHN DRYDEN.,"Have, in this poem, been my holy care."
3258,JOHN DRYDEN.,"As earth thy body keeps, thy soul the sky,"
3259,JOHN DRYDEN.,So shall this verse preserve thy memory;
3260,JOHN DRYDEN.,"For thou shalt make it live, because it sings of thee."

7725,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"virtue, savage, haughty, parsimonious, and unpopular: others were more"
7726,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"sweet and affable, made of a more pliant paste, humble, courteous, and"
7727,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"obliging, studious of doing charitable offices, and diffusive of the"
7728,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,goods which they enjoyed. The last of these is the proper and indelible
7729,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,character of your Grace's family. God Almighty has endued you with a
7730,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"softness, a beneficence, an attractive behaviour winning on the hearts"
7731,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"of others; and so sensible of their misery, that the wounds of fortune"
7732,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"seem not inflicted on them, but on yourself. You are so ready to"
7733,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"redress, that you almost prevent their wishes, and always exceed their"
7734,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"expectations; as if what was yours, was not your own, and not given you"
7735,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"to possess, but to bestow on wanting merit. But this is a topic which I"
7736,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"must cast in shades, lest I offend your modesty, which is so far from"
7737,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"being ostentatious of the good you do, that it blushes even to have it"
7738,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,known; and therefore I must leave you to the satisfaction and testimony
7739,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"of your own conscience, which, though it be a silent panegyric, is yet"
7740,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,the best.
7741,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7742,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"You are so easy of access, that Poplicola was not more, whose doors were"
7743,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,opened on the outside to save the people even the common civility of
7744,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,asking entrance; where all were equally admitted--where nothing that was
7745,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"reasonable was denied--where misfortune was a powerful recommendation,"
7746,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,and where (I can scarce forbear saying) that want itself was a powerful
7747,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"mediator, and was next to merit."
7748,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7749,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"The history of Peru assures us, that their Incas, above all their titles"
7750,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,esteemed that the highest which called them Lovers of the Poor--a name
7751,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"more glorious than the Felix, Pius, and Augustus of the Roman emperors,"
7752,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"which were epithets of flattery, deserved by few of them, and not"
7753,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,running in a blood like the perpetual gentleness and inherent goodness
7754,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,of the Ormond family.
7755,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7756,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"Gold, as it is the purest, so it is the softest and most ductile of all"
7757,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"metals. Iron, which is the hardest, gathers rust, corrodes itself, and"
7758,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,is therefore subject to corruption; it was never intended for coins and
7759,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"medals, or to bear the faces and inscriptions of the great. Indeed, it"
7760,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"is fit for armour, to bear off insults, and preserve the wearer in the"
7761,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"day of battle; but the danger once repelled, it is laid aside by the"
7762,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"brave, as a garment too rough for civil conversation; a necessary guard"
7763,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"in war, but too harsh and cumbersome in peace, and which keeps off the"
7764,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,embraces of a more humane life.
7765,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7766,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"For this reason, my Lord, though you have courage in an heroical degree,"
7767,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"yet I ascribe it to you but as your second attribute: mercy,"
7768,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"beneficence, and compassion claim precedence, as they are first in the"
7769,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"Divine nature. An intrepid courage, which is inherent in your Grace, is"
7770,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"at best but a holiday kind of virtue, to be seldom exercised, and never"
7771,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"but in cases of necessity: affability, mildness, tenderness, and a word"
7772,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"which I would fain bring back to its original signification of virtue, I"
7773,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"mean good-nature, are of daily use: they are the bread of mankind, and"
7774,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"staff of life; neither sighs, nor tears, nor groans, nor curses of the"
7775,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"vanquished, follow acts of compassion and of charity, but a sincere"
7776,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"pleasure and serenity of mind, in him who performs an action of mercy,"
7777,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"which cannot suffer the misfortunes of another without redress, lest"
7778,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"they should bring a kind of contagion along with them, and pollute the"
7779,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,happiness which he enjoys.
7780,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7781,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"Yet since the perverse tempers of mankind, since oppression on one side,"
7782,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"and ambition on the other, are sometimes the unavoidable occasions of"
7783,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"war; that courage, that magnanimity, and resolution, which is born with"
7784,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"you, cannot be too much commended. And here it grieves me that I am"
7785,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,scanted in the pleasure of dwelling on many of your actions; but [Greek:
7786,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"aideomai Troas] is an expression which Tully often uses, when he would"
7787,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"do what he dares not, and fears the censure of the Romans."
7788,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7789,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"I have sometimes been forced to amplify on others; but here, where the"
7790,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"subject is so fruitful that the harvest overcomes the reaper, I am"
7791,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"shortened by my chain, and can only see what is forbidden me to reach,"
7792,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"since it is not permitted me to commend you, according to the extent of"
7793,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"my wishes, and much less is it in my power to make my commendations"
7794,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,equal to your merits. Yet in this frugality of your praises there are
7795,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,some things which I cannot omit without detracting from your character.
7796,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"You have so formed your own education, as enables you to pay the debt"
7797,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"you owe your country; or, more properly speaking, both your countries,"
7798,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"because you were born, I may almost say, in purple, at the castle of"
7799,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"Dublin, when your grandfather was Lord-Lieutenant, and have since been"
7800,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,bred in the court of England.
7801,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7802,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"If this address had been in verse, I might have called you, as Claudian"
7803,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"calls Mercury, _Numen commune, gemino faciens commercia mundo_. The"
7804,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"better to satisfy this double obligation, you have early cultivated the"
7805,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"genius you have to arms, that when the service of Britain or Ireland"
7806,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"shall require your courage and your conduct, you may exert them both to"
7807,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,the benefit of either country. You began in the Cabinet what you
7808,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,afterwards practised in the Camp; and thus both Lucullas and CÃ¦sar (to
7809,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,omit a crowd of shining Romans) formed themselves to war by the study of
7810,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"history, and by the examples of the greatest captains, both of Greece"
7811,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"and Italy, before their time. I name those two commanders in particular,"
7812,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,because they were better read in chronicle than any of the Roman
7813,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"leaders; and that Lucullus, in particular, having only the theory of war"
7814,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"from books, was thought fit, without practice, to be sent into the field"
7815,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"against the most formidable enemy of Rome. Tully, indeed, was called the"
7816,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,learned consul in derision; but then he was not born a soldier--his head
7817,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"was turned another way; when he read the Tactics, he was thinking on the"
7818,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"bar, which was his field of battle. The knowledge of warfare is thrown"
7819,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,away on a general who dares not make use of what he knows. I commend it
7820,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,only in a man of courage and resolution: in him it will direct his
7821,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"martial spirit, and teach him the way to the best victories,--which are"
7822,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"those which are least bloody, and which, though achieved by the hand,"
7823,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,are managed by the head. Science distinguishes a man of honour from one
7824,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,of those athletic brutes whom undeservedly we call heroes. Cursed be the
7825,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"poet who first honoured with that name a mere Ajax, a man-killing idiot!"
7826,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"The Ulysses of Ovid upbraids his ignorance, that he understood not the"
7827,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,shield for which he pleaded: there was engraven on it plans of cities
7828,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"and maps of countries which Ajax could not comprehend, but looked on"
7829,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"them as stupidly as his fellow-beast, the lion. But on the other side,"
7830,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,your Grace has given yourself the education of his rival; you have
7831,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"studied every spot of ground in Flanders, which for these ten years past"
7832,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,has been the scene of battles and of sieges. No wonder if you performed
7833,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,your part with such applause on a theatre which you understood so well.
7834,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7835,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"If I designed this for a poetical encomium, it were easy to enlarge on"
7836,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"so copious a subject; but, confining myself to the severity of truth,"
7837,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"and to what is becoming me to say, I must not only pass over many"
7838,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"instances of your military skill, but also those of your assiduous"
7839,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"diligence in the war, and of your personal bravery, attended with an"
7840,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,ardent thirst of honour--a long train of generosity--profuseness of
7841,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,doing good--a soul unsatisfied with all it has done and an
7842,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,unextinguished desire of doing more. But all this is matter for your own
7843,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"historians; I am, as Virgil says, _Spatiis exclusus iniquis_."
7844,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7845,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"Yet not to be wholly silent of all your charities, I must stay a little"
7846,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"on one action, which preferred the relief of others to the consideration"
7847,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"of yourself. When, in the battle of Landen, your heat of courage (a"
7848,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,fault only pardonable to your youth) had transported you so far before
7849,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"your friends, that they were unable to follow, much less to succour you;"
7850,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"when you were not only dangerously, but in all appearance mortally"
7851,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,wounded; when in that desperate condition you were made prisoner and
7852,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"carried to Namur, at that time in possession of the French: then it was,"
7853,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"my Lord, that you took a considerable part of what was remitted to you"
7854,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"of your own revenues, and, as a memorable instance of your heroic"
7855,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"charity, put it into the bands of Count Guiscard, who was governor of"
7856,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"the place, to be distributed among your fellow-prisoners. The French"
7857,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"commander, charmed with the greatness of your soul, accordingly"
7858,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,consigned it to the use for which it was intended by the donor; by which
7859,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"means the lives of so many miserable men were saved, and a comfortable"
7860,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"provision made for their subsistence, who had otherwise perished, had"
7861,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,not you been the companion of their misfortune; or rather sent by
7862,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"Providence, like another Joseph, to keep out famine from invading those"
7863,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,whom in humility you called your brethren. How happy was it for those
7864,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,poor creatures that your Grace was made their fellow-sufferer! and how
7865,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,glorious for you that you chose to want rather than not relieve the
7866,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"wants of others! The heathen poet, in commending the charity of Dido to"
7867,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"the Trojans, spoke like a Christian: _Non ignara mali, miseris"
7868,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"succurrere disco_. All men, even those of a different interest, and"
7869,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"contrary principles, must praise this action as the most eminent for"
7870,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"piety, not only in this degenerate age, but almost in any of the former;"
7871,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,when men were made _de meliore luto_; when examples of charity were
7872,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"frequent, and when there were in being, _Teucri pulcherrima proles,"
7873,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,magnanimi heroes nati melioribus annis_. No envy can detract from this:
7874,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"it will shine in history, and, like swans, grow whiter the longer it"
7875,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"endures, and the name of ORMOND will be more celebrated in his captivity"
7876,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,than in his greatest triumphs.
7877,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7878,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"But all actions of your Grace are of a piece, as waters keep the tenor"
7879,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"of their fountains: your compassion is general, and has the same effect"
7880,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"as well on enemies as friends. It is so much in your nature to do good,"
7881,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"that your life is but one continued act of placing benefits on many, as"
7882,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,the sun is always carrying his light to some part or other of the world;
7883,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"and were it not that your reason guides you where to give, I might"
7884,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,almost say that you could not help bestowing more than is consisting
7885,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,with the fortune of a private man or with the will of any but an
7886,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,Alexander.
7887,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7888,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"What wonder is it, then, that being born for a blessing to mankind, your"
7889,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,supposed death in that engagement was so generally lamented through the
7890,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,nation! The concernment for it was as universal as the loss; and though
7891,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"the gratitude might be counterfeit in some, yet the tears of all were"
7892,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"real: where every man deplored his private part in that calamity, and"
7893,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"even those who had not tasted of your favours, yet built so much on the"
7894,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"fame of your beneficence, that they bemoaned the loss of their"
7895,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,expectations.
7896,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,
7897,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,This brought the untimely death of your great father into fresh
7898,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,remembrance: as if the same decree had passed on two short successive
7899,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,generations of the virtuous; and I repeated to myself the same verses
7900,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"which I had formerly applied to him: _Ostendunt terris hunc tantÃ¹m fata,"
7901,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"nec ultrÃ  esse sinunt_. But to the joy, not only of all good men, but of"
7902,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"mankind in general, the unhappy omen took not place. You are still"
7903,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,living to enjoy the blessings and applause of all the good you have
7904,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"performed, the prayers of multitudes whom you have obliged, for your"
7905,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,long prosperity; and that your power of doing generous and charitable
7906,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,actions may be as extended as your will; which is by none more zealously
7907,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"desired than by your Grace's most humble, most obliged, and most"
7908,TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ORMOND.,"obedient servant,"

7916,PREFACE.,"It is with a poet as with a man who designs to build, and is very exact,"
7917,PREFACE.,"as he supposes, in casting up the cost beforehand; but, generally"
7918,PREFACE.,"speaking, he is mistaken in his account, and reckons short in the"
7919,PREFACE.,"expense he first intended. He alters his mind as the work proceeds, and"
7920,PREFACE.,"will have this or that convenience more, of which he had not thought"
7921,PREFACE.,"when he began. So has it happened to me: I have built a house, where I"
7922,PREFACE.,"intended but a lodge; yet with better success than a certain nobleman,"
7923,PREFACE.,"who, beginning with a dog-kennel, never lived to finish the palace he"
7924,PREFACE.,had contrived.
7925,PREFACE.,
7926,PREFACE.,From translating the first of Homer's Iliads (which I intended as an
7927,PREFACE.,essay to the whole work) I proceeded to the translation of the twelfth
7928,PREFACE.,"book of Ovid's Metamorphoses, because it contains, among other things,"
7929,PREFACE.,"the causes, the beginning, and ending of the Trojan war. Here I ought in"
7930,PREFACE.,reason to have stopped; but the speeches of Ajax and Ulysses lying next
7931,PREFACE.,"in my way, I could not baulk them. When I had compassed them, I was so"
7932,PREFACE.,"taken with the former part of the fifteenth book, which is the"
7933,PREFACE.,"masterpiece of the whole Metamorphoses, that I enjoined myself the"
7934,PREFACE.,"pleasing task of rendering it into English. And now I found, by the"
7935,PREFACE.,"number of my verses, that they began to swell into a little volume;"
7936,PREFACE.,which gave me an occasion of looking backward on some beauties of my
7937,PREFACE.,"author, in his former books. There occurred to me the hunting of the"
7938,PREFACE.,"boar, Cinyras and Myrrha, the good-natured story of Baucis and Philemon,"
7939,PREFACE.,"with the rest, which I hope I have translated closely enough, and given"
7940,PREFACE.,"them the same turn of verse which they had in the original; and this, I"
7941,PREFACE.,"may say without vanity, is not the talent of every poet. He who has"
7942,PREFACE.,"arrived the nearest to it, is the ingenious and learned Sandys, the best"
7943,PREFACE.,"versifier of the former age; if I may properly call it by that name,"
7944,PREFACE.,which was the former part of this concluding century. For Spenser and
7945,PREFACE.,Fairfax both flourished in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; great masters
7946,PREFACE.,in our language; and who saw much farther into the beauties of our
7947,PREFACE.,"numbers, than those who immediately followed them. Milton was the"
7948,PREFACE.,"poetical son of Spenser, and Mr Waller of Fairfax; for we have our"
7949,PREFACE.,"lineal descents and clans, as well as other families. Spenser more than"
7950,PREFACE.,"once insinuates, that the soul of Chaucer was transfused into his body;"
7951,PREFACE.,and that he was begotten by him two hundred years after his decease.
7952,PREFACE.,"Milton has acknowledged to me, that Spenser was his original; and many"
7953,PREFACE.,"besides myself have heard our famous Waller own, that he derived the"
7954,PREFACE.,"harmony of his numbers from the Godfrey of Bulloigne, which was turned"
7955,PREFACE.,into English by Mr Fairfax. But to return. Having done with Ovid for
7956,PREFACE.,"this time, it came into my mind, that our old English poet Chaucer in"
7957,PREFACE.,"many things resembled him, and that with no disadvantage on the side of"
7958,PREFACE.,"the modern author, as I shall endeavour to prove when I compare them."
7959,PREFACE.,"And as I am, and always have been, studious to promote the honour of my"
7960,PREFACE.,"native country, so I soon resolved to put their merits to the trial, by"
7961,PREFACE.,"turning some of the Canterbury tales into our language, as it is now"
7962,PREFACE.,"refined; for by this means, both the poets being set in the same light,"
7963,PREFACE.,"and dressed in the same English habit, story to be compared with story,"
7964,PREFACE.,"a certain judgment may be made betwixt them, by the reader, without"
7965,PREFACE.,"obtruding my opinion on him. Or if I seem partial to my countryman, and"
7966,PREFACE.,"predecessor in the laurel, the friends of antiquity are not few; and"
7967,PREFACE.,"besides many of the learned, Ovid has almost all the beaux, and the"
7968,PREFACE.,"whole fair sex, his declared patrons. Perhaps I have assumed somewhat"
7969,PREFACE.,"more to myself than they allow me, because I have adventured to sum up"
7970,PREFACE.,"the evidence; but the readers are the jury, and their privilege remains"
7971,PREFACE.,"entire to decide according to the merits of the cause, or, if they"
7972,PREFACE.,"please, to bring it to another hearing, before some other court. In the"
7973,PREFACE.,"meantime, to follow the thread of my discourse (as thoughts, according"
7974,PREFACE.,"to Mr Hobbs, have always some connexion), so from Chaucer I was led to"
7975,PREFACE.,"think on Boccace, who was not only his contemporary, but also pursued"
7976,PREFACE.,"the same studies; wrote novels in prose, and many works in verse:"
7977,PREFACE.,"particularly is said to have invented the octave rhyme, or stanza of"
7978,PREFACE.,"eight lines, which ever since has been maintained by the practice of all"
7979,PREFACE.,"Italian writers, who are, or at least assume the title of, Heroic Poets."
7980,PREFACE.,"He and Chaucer, among other things, had this in common, that they"
7981,PREFACE.,"refined their mother tongues; but with this difference, that Dante had"
7982,PREFACE.,"begun to file their language, at least in verse, before the time of"
7983,PREFACE.,"Boccace, who likewise received no little help from his master Petrarch."
7984,PREFACE.,"But the reformation of their prose was wholly owing to Boccace himself,"
7985,PREFACE.,who is yet the standard of purity in the Italian tongue; though many of
7986,PREFACE.,"his phrases are become obsolete, as in process of time it must needs"
7987,PREFACE.,"happen. Chaucer, as you have formerly been told by our learned Mr Rymer,"
7988,PREFACE.,"first adorned and amplified our barren tongue from the ProvenÃ§al, which"
7989,PREFACE.,was then the most polished of all the modern languages; but this subject
7990,PREFACE.,"has been copiously treated by that great critic, who deserves no little"
7991,PREFACE.,"commendation from us his countrymen. For these reasons of time, and"
7992,PREFACE.,"resemblance of genius in Chaucer and Boccace, I resolved to join them in"
7993,PREFACE.,my present work; to which I have added some original papers of my own;
7994,PREFACE.,"which, whether they are equal or inferior to my other poems, an author"
7995,PREFACE.,"is the most improper judge; and therefore, I leave them wholly to the"
7996,PREFACE.,"mercy of the reader. I will hope the best, that they will not be"
7997,PREFACE.,"condemned; but if they should, I have the excuse of an old gentleman,"
7998,PREFACE.,"who, mounting on horseback before some ladies, when I was present, got"
7999,PREFACE.,"up somewhat heavily, but desired of the fair spectators that they would"
8000,PREFACE.,"count fourscore and eight before they judged him. By the mercy of God, I"
8001,PREFACE.,"am already come within twenty years of his number, a cripple in my"
8002,PREFACE.,"limbs; but what decays are in my mind, the reader must determine. I"
8003,PREFACE.,"think myself as vigorous as ever in the faculties of my soul, excepting"
8004,PREFACE.,"only my memory, which is not impaired to any great degree; and if I lose"
8005,PREFACE.,"not more of it, I have no great reason to complain. What judgment I had,"
8006,PREFACE.,"increases rather than diminishes; and thoughts, such as they are, come"
8007,PREFACE.,"crowding in so fast upon me, that my only difficulty is to choose or to"
8008,PREFACE.,"reject; to run them into verse, or to give them the other harmony of"
8009,PREFACE.,"prose. I have so long studied and practised both, that they are grown"
8010,PREFACE.,"into a habit, and become familiar to me; in short, though I may lawfully"
8011,PREFACE.,"plead some part of the old gentleman's excuse, yet I will reserve it"
8012,PREFACE.,"till I think I have greater need, and ask no grains of allowance for the"
8013,PREFACE.,"faults of this my present work, but those which are given of course to"
8014,PREFACE.,human frailty. I will not trouble my reader with the shortness of time
8015,PREFACE.,"in which I writ it, or the several intervals of sickness. They who think"
8016,PREFACE.,"too well of their own performances, are apt to boast in their prefaces"
8017,PREFACE.,"how little time their works have cost them, and what other business of"
8018,PREFACE.,more importance interfered; but the reader will be as apt to ask the
8019,PREFACE.,"question, why they allowed not a longer time to make their works more"
8020,PREFACE.,"perfect? and why they had so despicable an opinion of their judges, as"
8021,PREFACE.,"to thrust their indigested stuff upon them, as if they deserved no"
8022,PREFACE.,better?
8023,PREFACE.,
8024,PREFACE.,"With this account of my present undertaking, I conclude the first part"
8025,PREFACE.,"of this discourse; in the second part, as at a second sitting, though I"
8026,PREFACE.,"alter not the draught, I must touch the same features over again, and"
8027,PREFACE.,"change the dead colouring of the whole. In general I will only say, that"
8028,PREFACE.,I have written nothing which savours of immorality or profaneness; at
8029,PREFACE.,"least, I am not conscious to myself of any such intention. If there"
8030,PREFACE.,"happen to be found an irreverent expression, or a thought too wanton,"
8031,PREFACE.,they are crept into my verses through my inadvertency; if the searchers
8032,PREFACE.,"find any in the cargo, let them be staved or forfeited, like contraband"
8033,PREFACE.,"goods; at least, let their authors be answerable for them, as being but"
8034,PREFACE.,"imported merchandise, and not of my own manufacture. On the other side,"
8035,PREFACE.,"I have endeavoured to choose such fables, both ancient and modern, as"
8036,PREFACE.,"contain in each of them some instructive moral, which I could prove by"
8037,PREFACE.,"induction; but the way is tedious, and they leap foremost into sight,"
8038,PREFACE.,without the reader's trouble of looking after them. I wish I could
8039,PREFACE.,"affirm with a safe conscience, that I had taken the same care in all my"
8040,PREFACE.,"former writings; for it must be owned, that supposing verses are never"
8041,PREFACE.,"so beautiful or pleasing, yet if they contain anything which shocks"
8042,PREFACE.,"religion, or good manners, they are at best, what Horace says of good"
8043,PREFACE.,"numbers without good sense, _Versus inopes rerum, nugaeque canorae_."
8044,PREFACE.,"Thus far, I hope, I am right in court, without renouncing my other right"
8045,PREFACE.,"of self-defence, where I have been wrongfully accused, and my sense"
8046,PREFACE.,"withdrawn into blasphemy or bawdry, as it has often been by a religious"
8047,PREFACE.,"lawyer, in a late pleading against the stage, in which he mixes truth"
8048,PREFACE.,"with falsehood, and has not forgotten the old rule of calumniating"
8049,PREFACE.,"strongly, that something may remain."
8050,PREFACE.,
8051,PREFACE.,"I resume the thread of my discourse with the first of my translation,"
8052,PREFACE.,which was the first Iliad of Homer. If it shall please God to give me
8053,PREFACE.,"longer life, and moderate health, my intentions are to translate the"
8054,PREFACE.,whole Ilias; provided still that I meet with those encouragements from
8055,PREFACE.,the public which may enable me to proceed in my undertaking with some
8056,PREFACE.,"cheerfulness. And this I dare assure the world beforehand, that I have"
8057,PREFACE.,"found, by trial, Homer a more pleasing task than Virgil (though I say"
8058,PREFACE.,not the translation will be less laborious); for the Grecian is more
8059,PREFACE.,"according to my genius, than the Latin poet. In the works of the two"
8060,PREFACE.,"authors, we may read their manners and natural inclinations, which are"
8061,PREFACE.,"wholly different. Virgil was of a quiet, sedate temper; Homer was"
8062,PREFACE.,"violent, impetuous, and full of fire. The chief talent of Virgil was"
8063,PREFACE.,"propriety of thoughts, and ornament of words; Homer was rapid in his"
8064,PREFACE.,"thoughts, and took all the liberties, both of numbers and of"
8065,PREFACE.,"expressions, which his language, and the age in which he lived, allowed"
8066,PREFACE.,"him: Homer's invention was more copious, Virgil's more confined; so that"
8067,PREFACE.,"if Homer had not led the way, it was not in Virgil to have begun heroic"
8068,PREFACE.,"poetry; for nothing can be more evident, than that the Roman poem is but"
8069,PREFACE.,"the second part of the Ilias; a continuation of the same story, and the"
8070,PREFACE.,persons already formed: the manners of Ãneas are those of Hector
8071,PREFACE.,superadded to those which Homer gave him. The adventures of Ulysses in
8072,PREFACE.,"the Odysseis are imitated in the first six books of Virgil's Ãneas, and"
8073,PREFACE.,though the accidents are not the same (which would have argued him of a
8074,PREFACE.,"servile copying, and total barrenness of invention), yet the seas were"
8075,PREFACE.,"the same in which both the heroes wandered, and Dido cannot be denied to"
8076,PREFACE.,be the poetical daughter of Calypso. The six latter books of Virgil's
8077,PREFACE.,poem are the four and twenty Iliads contracted; a quarrel occasioned by
8078,PREFACE.,"a lady, a single combat, battles fought, and a town besieged. I say not"
8079,PREFACE.,"this in derogation to Virgil, neither do I contradict anything which I"
8080,PREFACE.,"have formerly said in his just praise, for his episodes are almost"
8081,PREFACE.,wholly of his own invention; and the form which he has given to the
8082,PREFACE.,"telling makes the tale his own, even though the original story had been"
8083,PREFACE.,"the same. But this proves, however, that Homer taught Virgil to design;"
8084,PREFACE.,"and if invention be the first virtue of an epic poet, then the Latin"
8085,PREFACE.,"poem can only be allowed the second place. Mr Hobbs, in the preface to"
8086,PREFACE.,his own bald translation of the Ilias (studying poetry as he did
8087,PREFACE.,"mathematics, when it was too late), Mr Hobbs, I say, begins the praise"
8088,PREFACE.,"of Homer where he should have ended it. He tells us, that the first"
8089,PREFACE.,"beauty of an Epic poem consists in diction, that is, in the choice of"
8090,PREFACE.,"words, and harmony of numbers. Now, the words are the colouring of the"
8091,PREFACE.,"work, which in the order of nature is last to be considered: the design,"
8092,PREFACE.,"the disposition, the manners, and the thoughts, are all before it; where"
8093,PREFACE.,"any of those are wanting or imperfect, so much wants or is imperfect in"
8094,PREFACE.,"the imitation of human life, which is in the very definition of a poem."
8095,PREFACE.,"Words indeed, like glaring colours, are the first beauties that arise,"
8096,PREFACE.,"and strike the sight; but if the draught be false or lame, the figures"
8097,PREFACE.,"ill-disposed, the manners obscure or inconsistent, or the thoughts"
8098,PREFACE.,"unnatural, then the finest colours are but daubing, and the piece is a"
8099,PREFACE.,beautiful monster at the best. Neither Virgil nor Homer were deficient
8100,PREFACE.,"in any of the former beauties; but in this last, which is expression,"
8101,PREFACE.,"the Roman poet is at least equal to the Grecian, as I have said"
8102,PREFACE.,"elsewhere, supplying the poverty of his language by his musical ear, and"
8103,PREFACE.,"by his diligence. But to return: our two great poets, being so different"
8104,PREFACE.,"in their tempers, one choleric and sanguine, the other phlegmatic and"
8105,PREFACE.,"melancholic; that which makes them excel in their several ways is, that"
8106,PREFACE.,"each of them has followed his own natural inclination, as well in"
8107,PREFACE.,"forming the design, as in the execution of it. The very heroes show"
8108,PREFACE.,"their authors; Achilles is hot, impatient, revengeful--_impiger,"
8109,PREFACE.,"iracundus, inexorabilis, acer,_ &c.: Ãneas patient, considerate, careful"
8110,PREFACE.,"of his people, and merciful to his enemies; ever submissive to the will"
8111,PREFACE.,"of Heaven--_quÃ² fata trahunt, retrahuntque, sequamur_. I could please"
8112,PREFACE.,"myself with enlarging on this subject, but am forced to defer it to a"
8113,PREFACE.,"fitter time. From all I have said, I will only draw this inference, that"
8114,PREFACE.,"the action of Homer being more full of vigour than that of Virgil,"
8115,PREFACE.,"according to the temper of the writer, is of consequence more pleasing"
8116,PREFACE.,to the reader. One warms you by degrees; the other sets you on fire all
8117,PREFACE.,"at once, and never intermits his heat. 'Tis the same difference which"
8118,PREFACE.,Longinus makes betwixt the effects of eloquence in Demosthenes and
8119,PREFACE.,Tully--one persuades; the other commands. You never cool while you read
8120,PREFACE.,"Homer, even not in the second book (a graceful flattery to his"
8121,PREFACE.,"countrymen), but he hastens from the ships, and concludes not that book"
8122,PREFACE.,till he has made you an amends by the violent playing of a new machine.
8123,PREFACE.,"From thence he hurries on his action with variety of events, and ends it"
8124,PREFACE.,"in less compass than two months. This vehemence of his, I confess, is"
8125,PREFACE.,more suitable to my temper; and therefore I have translated his first
8126,PREFACE.,book with greater pleasure than any part of Virgil. But it was not a
8127,PREFACE.,pleasure without pains; the continual agitations of the spirits must
8128,PREFACE.,"needs be a weakening of any constitution, especially in age, and many"
8129,PREFACE.,"pauses are required for refreshment betwixt the heats, the Iliad of"
8130,PREFACE.,itself being a third part longer than all Virgil's works together.
8131,PREFACE.,
8132,PREFACE.,This is what I thought needful in this place to say of Homer. I proceed
8133,PREFACE.,to Ovid and Chaucer; considering the former only in relation to the
8134,PREFACE.,latter. With Ovid ended the golden age of the Roman tongue: from Chaucer
8135,PREFACE.,the purity of the English tongue began. The manners of the poets were
8136,PREFACE.,"not unlike: both of them were well-bred, well-natured, amorous, and"
8137,PREFACE.,"libertine, at least in their writings--it may be also in their lives."
8138,PREFACE.,Their studies were the same--philosophy and philology. Both of them were
8139,PREFACE.,"known in astronomy, of which Ovid's books of the Roman feasts, and"
8140,PREFACE.,"Chaucer's treatise of the Astrolabe, are sufficient witnesses. But"
8141,PREFACE.,"Chaucer was likewise an astrologer, as were Virgil, Horace, Persius, and"
8142,PREFACE.,Manilius. Both writ with wonderful facility and clearness: neither were
8143,PREFACE.,"great inventors; for Ovid only copied the Grecian fables, and most of"
8144,PREFACE.,"Chaucer's stories were taken from his Italian contemporaries, or their"
8145,PREFACE.,predecessors. Boccace's Decameron was first published; and from thence
8146,PREFACE.,our Englishman has borrowed many of his Canterbury tales; yet that of
8147,PREFACE.,"Palamon and Arcite was written in all probability by some Italian wit,"
8148,PREFACE.,in a former age; as I shall prove hereafter. The tale of Grizzild was
8149,PREFACE.,the invention of Petrarch; by him sent to Boccace; from whom it came to
8150,PREFACE.,Chaucer. Troilus and Cressida was also written by a Lombard author; but
8151,PREFACE.,"much amplified by our English translator, as well as beautified; the"
8152,PREFACE.,genius of our countrymen in general being rather to improve an
8153,PREFACE.,"invention, than to invent themselves; as is evident not only in our"
8154,PREFACE.,"poetry, but in many of our manufactures. I find I have anticipated"
8155,PREFACE.,"already, and taken up from Boccace before I come to him; but there is so"
8156,PREFACE.,"much less behind; and I am of the temper of most kings, who love to be"
8157,PREFACE.,"in debt, are all for present money, no matter how they pay it"
8158,PREFACE.,"afterwards: besides, the nature of a preface is rambling; never wholly"
8159,PREFACE.,"out of the way, nor in it. This I have learned from the practice of"
8160,PREFACE.,"honest Montaign, and return at my pleasure to Ovid and Chaucer, of whom"
8161,PREFACE.,I have little more to say. Both of them built on the inventions of other
8162,PREFACE.,"men; yet since Chancer had something of his own, as the Wife of Bath's"
8163,PREFACE.,"Tale the Cock and the Fox, which I have translated, and some others, I"
8164,PREFACE.,may justly give our countryman the precedence in that part; since I can
8165,PREFACE.,remember nothing of Ovid which was wholly his. Both of them understood
8166,PREFACE.,"the manners, under which name I comprehend the passions, and, in a"
8167,PREFACE.,"larger sense the descriptions of persons, and their very habits: for an"
8168,PREFACE.,"example, I see Baucis and Philemon as perfectly before me, as if some"
8169,PREFACE.,ancient painter had drawn them; and all the pilgrims in the Canterbury
8170,PREFACE.,"tales, their humours, their features, and the very dress, as distinctly"
8171,PREFACE.,as if I had supped with them at the Tabard in Southwark: yet even there
8172,PREFACE.,"too the figures in Chaucer are much more lively, and set in a better"
8173,PREFACE.,"light; which though I have not time to prove, yet I appeal to the"
8174,PREFACE.,"reader, and am sure he will clear me from partiality. The thoughts and"
8175,PREFACE.,words remain to be considered in the comparison of the two poets; and I
8176,PREFACE.,"have saved myself one half of that labour, by owning that Ovid lived"
8177,PREFACE.,"when the Roman tongue was in its meridian; Chaucer, in the dawning of"
8178,PREFACE.,our language: therefore that part of the comparison stands not on an
8179,PREFACE.,"equal foot, any more than the diction of Ennius and Ovid; or of Chaucer"
8180,PREFACE.,and our present English. The words are given up as a post not to be
8181,PREFACE.,"defended in our poet, because he wanted the modern art of fortifying."
8182,PREFACE.,The thoughts remain to be considered; and they are to be measured only
8183,PREFACE.,"by their propriety; that is, as they flow more or less naturally from"
8184,PREFACE.,"the persons described, on such and such occasions. The vulgar judges,"
8185,PREFACE.,"which are nine parts in ten of all nations, who call conceits and"
8186,PREFACE.,"jingles wit, who see Ovid full of them, and Chaucer altogether without"
8187,PREFACE.,"them, will think me little less than mad for preferring the Englishman"
8188,PREFACE.,"to the Roman; yet, with their leave, I must presume to say, that the"
8189,PREFACE.,"things they admire are only glittering trifles, and so far from being"
8190,PREFACE.,"witty, that in a serious poem they are nauseous, because they are"
8191,PREFACE.,"unnatural. Would any man, who is ready to die for love, describe his"
8192,PREFACE.,"passion like Narcissus? Would he think of _inopem me copia fecit_, and a"
8193,PREFACE.,"dozen more of such expressions, poured on the neck of one another, and"
8194,PREFACE.,"signifying all the same thing? If this were wit, was this a time to be"
8195,PREFACE.,"witty, when the poor wretch was in the agony of death? This is just John"
8196,PREFACE.,"Littlewit in Bartholomew Fair, who had a conceit (as he tells you) left"
8197,PREFACE.,him in his misery; a miserable conceit. On these occasions the poet
8198,PREFACE.,"should endeavour to raise pity; but instead of this, Ovid is tickling"
8199,PREFACE.,"you to laugh. Virgil never made use of such machines, when he was moving"
8200,PREFACE.,you to commiserate the death of Dido: he would not destroy what he was
8201,PREFACE.,"building. Chaucer makes Arcite violent in his love, and unjust in the"
8202,PREFACE.,"pursuit of it; yet when he came to die, he made him think more"
8203,PREFACE.,"reasonably: he repents not of his love, for that had altered his"
8204,PREFACE.,"character; but acknowledges the injustice of his proceedings, and"
8205,PREFACE.,resigns Emilia to Palamon. What would Ovid have done on this occasion?
8206,PREFACE.,He would certainly have made Arcite witty on his deathbed. He had
8207,PREFACE.,"complained he was farther off from possession by being so near, and a"
8208,PREFACE.,"thousand such boyisms, which Chaucer rejected as below the dignity of"
8209,PREFACE.,"the subject. They who think otherwise would, by the same reason, prefer"
8210,PREFACE.,"Lucan and Ovid to Homer and Virgil, and Martial to all four of them. As"
8211,PREFACE.,"for the turn of words, in which Ovid particularly excels all poets, they"
8212,PREFACE.,"are sometimes a fault, and sometimes a beauty, as they are used properly"
8213,PREFACE.,"or improperly; but in strong passions always to be shunned, because"
8214,PREFACE.,"passions are serious, and will admit no playing. The French have a high"
8215,PREFACE.,"value for them; and I confess, they are often what they call delicate,"
8216,PREFACE.,when they are introduced with judgment; but Chaucer writ with more
8217,PREFACE.,"simplicity, and followed nature more closely, than to use them. I have"
8218,PREFACE.,"thus far, to the best of my knowledge, been an upright judge betwixt the"
8219,PREFACE.,"parties in competition, not meddling with the design nor the disposition"
8220,PREFACE.,"of it; because the design was not their own, and in the disposing of it"
8221,PREFACE.,they were eqaal. It remains that I say somewhat of Chaucer in
8222,PREFACE.,particular.
8223,PREFACE.,
8224,PREFACE.,"In the first place, as he is the father of English poetry, so I hold him"
8225,PREFACE.,"in the same degree of veneration as the Grecians held Homer, or the"
8226,PREFACE.,Romans Virgil. He is a perpetual fountain of good sense; learned in all
8227,PREFACE.,"sciences, and therefore speaks properly on all subjects; as he knew what"
8228,PREFACE.,"to say, so he knows also when to leave off--a continence which is"
8229,PREFACE.,"practised by few writers, and scarcely by any of the ancients, excepting"
8230,PREFACE.,Virgil and Horace. One of our late great poets is sunk in his
8231,PREFACE.,"reputation, because he could never forgive any conceit which came in his"
8232,PREFACE.,"way; but swept like a drag-net, great and small. There was plenty"
8233,PREFACE.,"enough, but the dishes were ill-sorted; whole pyramids of sweetmeats,"
8234,PREFACE.,"for boys and women; but little of solid meat, for men. All this"
8235,PREFACE.,"proceeded not from any want of knowledge, but of judgment; neither did"
8236,PREFACE.,he want that in discerning the beauties and faults of other poets; but
8237,PREFACE.,only indulged himself in the luxury of writing; and perhaps knew it was
8238,PREFACE.,"a fault, but hoped the reader would not find it. For this reason, though"
8239,PREFACE.,"he must always be thought a great poet, he is no longer esteemed a good"
8240,PREFACE.,"writer; and for ten impressions, which his works have had in so many"
8241,PREFACE.,"successive years, yet at present a hundred books are scarcely purchased"
8242,PREFACE.,"once a twelvemonth: for, as my last Lord Rochester said, though somewhat"
8243,PREFACE.,"profanely, not being of God, he could not stand."
8244,PREFACE.,
8245,PREFACE.,Chaucer followed nature everywhere; but was never so bold to go beyond
8246,PREFACE.,"her: and there is a great difference of being _Poeta_ and _nimis Poeta_,"
8247,PREFACE.,"if we believe Catullus, as much as betwixt a modest behaviour and"
8248,PREFACE.,"affectation. The verse of Chaucer, I confess, is not harmonious to us;"
8249,PREFACE.,"but it is like the eloquence of one whom Tacitus commends, it was"
8250,PREFACE.,"_auribus istius temporis accommodata_. They who lived with him, and some"
8251,PREFACE.,"time after him, thought it musical; and it continues so even in our"
8252,PREFACE.,"judgment, if compared with the numbers of Lidgate and Gower, his"
8253,PREFACE.,"contemporaries: there is the rude sweetness of a Scotch tune in it,"
8254,PREFACE.,"which is natural and pleasing, though not perfect. It is true, I cannot"
8255,PREFACE.,go so far as he who published the last edition of him; for he would make
8256,PREFACE.,"us believe the fault is in our ears, and that there were really ten"
8257,PREFACE.,syllables in a verse where we find but nine. But this opinion is not
8258,PREFACE.,"worth confuting; it is so gross and obvious an error, that common sense"
8259,PREFACE.,(which is a rule in every thing but matters of faith and revelation)
8260,PREFACE.,"must convince the reader, that equality of numbers in every verse which"
8261,PREFACE.,"we call Heroic, was either not known, or not always practised in"
8262,PREFACE.,Chaucer's age. It were an easy matter to produce some thousands of his
8263,PREFACE.,"verses, which are lame for want of half a foot, and sometimes a whole"
8264,PREFACE.,"one, and which no pronunciation can make otherwise. We can only say,"
8265,PREFACE.,"that he lived in the infancy of our poetry, and that nothing is brought"
8266,PREFACE.,to perfection at the first. We must be children before we grow men.
8267,PREFACE.,"There was an Ennius, and in process of time a Lucilius, and a Lucretius,"
8268,PREFACE.,"before Virgil and Horace; even after Chaucer there was a Spenser, a"
8269,PREFACE.,"Harrington, a Fairfax, before Waller and Denham were in being; and our"
8270,PREFACE.,numbers were in their nonage till these last appeared. I need say little
8271,PREFACE.,"of his parentage, life and fortunes: they are to be found at large in"
8272,PREFACE.,all the editions of his works. He was employed abroad and favoured by
8273,PREFACE.,"Edward the Third, Richard the Second, and Henry the Fourth, and was"
8274,PREFACE.,"poet, as I suppose, to all three of them. In Richard's time, I doubt, he"
8275,PREFACE.,was a little dipt in the rebellion of the commons; and being
8276,PREFACE.,"brother-in-law to John of Gaunt, it was no wonder if he followed the"
8277,PREFACE.,fortunes of that family; and was well with Henry the Fourth when he had
8278,PREFACE.,"deposed his predecessor. Neither is it to be admired, that Henry, who"
8279,PREFACE.,"was a wise as well as a valiant prince, who claimed by succession, and"
8280,PREFACE.,"was sensible that his title was not sound, but was rightfully in"
8281,PREFACE.,"Mortimer, who had married the heir of York; it was not to be admired, I"
8282,PREFACE.,"say, if that great politician should be pleased to have the greatest wit"
8283,PREFACE.,"of those times in his interests, and to be the trumpet of his praises."
8284,PREFACE.,"Augustus had given him the example, by the advice of Maecenas, who"
8285,PREFACE.,recommended Virgil and Horace to him; whose praises helped to make him
8286,PREFACE.,"popular while he was alive, and after his death have made him precious"
8287,PREFACE.,"to posterity. As for the religion of our poet, he seems to have some"
8288,PREFACE.,"little bias towards the opinions of Wickliff, after John of Gaunt his"
8289,PREFACE.,patron; somewhat of which appears in the tale of Piers Plowman: yet I
8290,PREFACE.,cannot blame him for inveighing so sharply against the vices of the
8291,PREFACE.,"clergy in his age: their pride, their ambition, their pomp, their"
8292,PREFACE.,"avarice, their worldly interest, deserved the lashes which he gave them,"
8293,PREFACE.,"both in that, and in most of his Canterbury tales: neither has his"
8294,PREFACE.,contemporary Boccace spared them. Yet both those poets lived in much
8295,PREFACE.,esteem with good and holy men in orders; for the scandal which is given
8296,PREFACE.,"by particular priests, reflects not on the sacred function. Chaucer's"
8297,PREFACE.,"Monk, his Chanon, and his Fryer, took not from the character of his Good"
8298,PREFACE.,Parson. A satirical poet is the check of the laymen on bad priests. We
8299,PREFACE.,"are only to take care, that we involve not the innocent with the guilty"
8300,PREFACE.,"in the same condemnation. The good cannot be too much honoured, nor the"
8301,PREFACE.,bad too coarsely used; for the corruption of the best becomes the worst.
8302,PREFACE.,"When a clergyman is whipped, his gown is first taken off, by which the"
8303,PREFACE.,"dignity of his order is secured: if he be wrongfully accused, he has his"
8304,PREFACE.,"action of slander; and it is at the poet's peril, if he transgress the"
8305,PREFACE.,"law. But they will tell us, that all kind of satire, though never so"
8306,PREFACE.,"well deserved by particular priests, yet brings the whole order into"
8307,PREFACE.,"contempt. Is then the peerage of England anything dishonoured, when a"
8308,PREFACE.,"peer suffers for his treason? If he be libelled, or any way defamed, he"
8309,PREFACE.,has his _Scandalum Magnatum_ to punish the offender. They who use this
8310,PREFACE.,"kind of argument, seem to be conscious to themselves of somewhat which"
8311,PREFACE.,has deserved the poet's lash; and are less concerned for their public
8312,PREFACE.,"capacity, than for their private; at least there is pride at the bottom"
8313,PREFACE.,of their reasoning. If the faults of men in orders are only to be judged
8314,PREFACE.,"among themselves, they are all in some sort parties; for, since they say"
8315,PREFACE.,"the honour of their order is concerned in every member of it, how can we"
8316,PREFACE.,be sure that they will be impartial judges? How far I may be allowed to
8317,PREFACE.,"speak my opinion in this case, I know not; but I am sure a dispute of"
8318,PREFACE.,this nature caused mischief in abundance betwixt a king of England and
8319,PREFACE.,"an archbishop of Canterbury; one standing up for the laws of his land,"
8320,PREFACE.,and the other for the honour (as he called it) of God's Church; which
8321,PREFACE.,"ended in the murder of the prelate, and in the whipping of his majesty"
8322,PREFACE.,from post to pillar for his penance. The learned and ingenious Dr Drake
8323,PREFACE.,has saved me the labour of inquiring into the esteem and reverence which
8324,PREFACE.,"the priests have, had of old; and I would rather extend than diminish"
8325,PREFACE.,"any part of it; yet I must needs say, that when a priest provokes me"
8326,PREFACE.,"without any occasion given him, I have no reason, unless it be the"
8327,PREFACE.,"charity of a Christian, to forgive him. _Prior laesit_ is justification"
8328,PREFACE.,"sufficient in the civil law. If I answer him in his own language,"
8329,PREFACE.,"self-defence, I am sure, must be allowed me; and if I carry it farther,"
8330,PREFACE.,"even to a sharp recrimination, somewhat may be indulged to human"
8331,PREFACE.,"frailty. Yet my resentment has not wrought as far, but that I have"
8332,PREFACE.,"followed Chaucer in his character of a holy man, and have enlarged on"
8333,PREFACE.,"that subject with some pleasure, reserving to myself the right, if I"
8334,PREFACE.,"shall think fit hereafter, to describe another sort of priests, such as"
8335,PREFACE.,are more easily to be found than the Good Parson; such as have given the
8336,PREFACE.,"last blow to Christianity in this age, by a practice so contrary to"
8337,PREFACE.,their doctrine. But this will keep cold till another time. In the mean
8338,PREFACE.,"while, I take up Chaucer where I left him. He must have been a man of a"
8339,PREFACE.,"most wonderful comprehensive nature, because, as it has been truly"
8340,PREFACE.,"observed of him, he has taken into the compass of his Canterbury tales"
8341,PREFACE.,the various manners and humours (as we now call them) of the whole
8342,PREFACE.,"English nation, in his age. Not a single character has escaped him. All"
8343,PREFACE.,his pilgrims are severally distinguished from each other; and not only
8344,PREFACE.,"in their inclinations, but in their very physiognomies and persons."
8345,PREFACE.,"Baptista Porta could not have described their natures better, than by"
8346,PREFACE.,the marks which the poet gives them. The matter and manner of their
8347,PREFACE.,"tales, and of their telling, are so suited to their different"
8348,PREFACE.,"edncations, humours, and callings, that each of them would be improper"
8349,PREFACE.,in any other mouth. Even the grave and serious characters are
8350,PREFACE.,distinguished by their several sorts of gravity: their discourses are
8351,PREFACE.,"such as belong to their age, their calling, and their breeding; such as"
8352,PREFACE.,"are becoming of them, and of them only. Some of his persons are vicious,"
8353,PREFACE.,"and some virtuous; some are unlearned, or (as Chaucer calls them) lewd,"
8354,PREFACE.,and some are learned. Even the ribaldry of the low characters is
8355,PREFACE.,"different. The Reeve, the Miller, and the Cook, are several men, and"
8356,PREFACE.,"distinguished from each other, as much as the mincing Lady Prioress, and"
8357,PREFACE.,the broad-speaking gap-toothed Wife of Bath. But enough of this: there
8358,PREFACE.,"is such a variety of game springing up before me, that I am distracted"
8359,PREFACE.,"in my choice, and know not which to follow. 'Tis sufficient to say,"
8360,PREFACE.,"according to the proverb, that here is God's plenty. We have our"
8361,PREFACE.,"forefathers and great-granddames all before us, as they were in"
8362,PREFACE.,"Chaucer's days: their general characters are still remaining in mankind,"
8363,PREFACE.,"and even in England, though they are called by other names than those of"
8364,PREFACE.,"monks and friars, and chanons, and lady abbesses, and nuns: for mankind"
8365,PREFACE.,"is ever the same, and nothing lost out of nature, though every thing is"
8366,PREFACE.,"altered. May I have leave to do myself the justice, (since my enemies"
8367,PREFACE.,"will do me none, and are so far from granting me to be a good poet, that"
8368,PREFACE.,"they will not allow me so much as to be a Christian, or a moral man);"
8369,PREFACE.,"may I have leave, I say, to inform my reader, that I have confined my"
8370,PREFACE.,choice to such tales of Chaucer as savour nothing of immodesty. If I had
8371,PREFACE.,"desired more to please than to instruct, the Reeve, the Miller, the"
8372,PREFACE.,"Shipman, the Merchants, the Sumner, and above all the Wife of Bath, in"
8373,PREFACE.,"the prologue to her tale, would have procured me as many friends and"
8374,PREFACE.,readers as there are beaux and ladies of pleasure in the town. But I
8375,PREFACE.,"will no more offend against good manners. I am sensible, as I ought to"
8376,PREFACE.,"be, of the scandal I have given by my loose writings; and make what"
8377,PREFACE.,reparation I am able by this public acknowledgment. If any thing of this
8378,PREFACE.,"nature, or of profaneness, be crept into these poems, I am so far from"
8379,PREFACE.,"defending it, that I disown it. _Totum hoc indicium volo._ Chaucer makes"
8380,PREFACE.,"another manner of apology for his broad-speaking, and Boccace makes the"
8381,PREFACE.,"like; but I will follow neither of them. Our countryman, in the end of"
8382,PREFACE.,"his characters, before the Canterbury tales, thus excuses the ribaldry,"
8383,PREFACE.,which is very gross in many of his novels.
8384,PREFACE.,
8385,PREFACE.,"""But first, I pray you of your courtesy,"
8386,PREFACE.,"That ye ne arrettee it nought my villainy,"
8387,PREFACE.,"Though that I plainly speak in this mattere,"
8388,PREFACE.,"To tellen you her words, and eke her chere:"
8389,PREFACE.,"Ne though I speak her words properly,"
8390,PREFACE.,"For this ye knowen as well as I,"
8391,PREFACE.,"Who shall tellen a tale after a man,"
8392,PREFACE.,He mote rehearse as nye as ever he can:
8393,PREFACE.,"Everich word of it been in his charge,"
8394,PREFACE.,"All speke he, never so rudely, ne large."
8395,PREFACE.,"Or else he mote tellen his tale untrue,"
8396,PREFACE.,"Or feine things, or find words new:"
8397,PREFACE.,"He may not spare, although he were his brother,"
8398,PREFACE.,"He mote as well say o word as another,"
8399,PREFACE.,"Christ spake himself full broad in holy writ,"
8400,PREFACE.,And well I wote no villainy is it;
8401,PREFACE.,"Eke Plato saith, who so can him rede,"
8402,PREFACE.,"the words mote been cousin to the dede."""
8403,PREFACE.,
8404,PREFACE.,"Yet, if a man should have inquired of Boccace or of Chaucer what need"
8405,PREFACE.,"they had of introducing such characters, where obscene words were proper"
8406,PREFACE.,"in their mouths, but very indecent to be heard,--I know not what answer"
8407,PREFACE.,"they could have made; for that reason, such tale shall be left untold by"
8408,PREFACE.,"me. You have here a specimen of Chaucer's language, which is so"
8409,PREFACE.,"obsolete, that his sense is scarce to be understood; and you have"
8410,PREFACE.,"likewise more than one example of his unequal numbers, which were"
8411,PREFACE.,"mentioned before. Yet many of his verses consist of ten syllables, and"
8412,PREFACE.,"the words not much behind our present English; as, for example, these"
8413,PREFACE.,two lines in the description of the carpenter's young wife:
8414,PREFACE.,
8415,PREFACE.,"""Wincing she was, as is a jolly colt,"
8416,PREFACE.,"Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt."""
8417,PREFACE.,
8418,PREFACE.,I have almost done with Chaucer when I have answered some objections
8419,PREFACE.,relating to my present work. I find some people are offended that I have
8420,PREFACE.,"turned these tales into modern English, because they think them unworthy"
8421,PREFACE.,"of my pains, and look on Chaucer as a dry, old-fashioned wit not worth"
8422,PREFACE.,reviving. I have often heard the late Earl of Leicester say that Mr
8423,PREFACE.,"Cowley himself was of that opinion, who, having read him over at my"
8424,PREFACE.,lord's request declared he had no taste of him. I dare not advance my
8425,PREFACE.,"opinion against the judgment of so great an author, but I think it fair,"
8426,PREFACE.,"however, to leave the decision to the public. Mr Cowley was too modest"
8427,PREFACE.,"to set up for a dictator, and being shocked, perhaps, with his old"
8428,PREFACE.,"style, never examined into the depth of his good sense. Chaucer, I"
8429,PREFACE.,"confess, is a rough diamond, and must first be polished ere he shines."
8430,PREFACE.,"I deny not, likewise, that, living in our early days of poetry, he"
8431,PREFACE.,"writes not always of a piece, but sometimes mingles trivial things with"
8432,PREFACE.,"those of greater moment. Sometimes also, though not often, he runs riot,"
8433,PREFACE.,"like Ovid, and knows not when he has said enough. But there are more"
8434,PREFACE.,"great wits besides Chaucer, whose fault is their excess of conceits, and"
8435,PREFACE.,"those ill sorted. An author is not to write all he can, but only all he"
8436,PREFACE.,ought. Having observed this redundancy in Chaucer (as it is an easy
8437,PREFACE.,"matter for a man of ordinary parts to find a fault in one of greater), I"
8438,PREFACE.,"have not tied myself to a literal translation, but have often omitted"
8439,PREFACE.,"what I judged unnecessary, or not of dignity enough to appear in the"
8440,PREFACE.,"company of better thoughts. I have presumed farther, in some places, and"
8441,PREFACE.,"added somewhat of my own where I thought my author was deficient, and"
8442,PREFACE.,"had not given his thoughts their true lustre, for want of words in the"
8443,PREFACE.,"beginning of our language. And to this I was the more emboldened,"
8444,PREFACE.,because (if I may be permitted to say it of myself) I found I had a soul
8445,PREFACE.,"congenial to his, and that I had been conversant in the same studies."
8446,PREFACE.,"Another poet, in another age, may take the same liberty with my"
8447,PREFACE.,"writings, if, at least, they live long enough to deserve correction. It"
8448,PREFACE.,"was also necessary sometimes to restore the sense of Chaucer, which was"
8449,PREFACE.,lost or mangled in the errors of the press. Let this example suffice at
8450,PREFACE.,"present. In the story of Palamon and Arcite, where the temple of Diana"
8451,PREFACE.,"is described, you find these verses in all the editions of our author:--"
8452,PREFACE.,
8453,PREFACE.,"""There saw I DanÃ¨ turned into a tree,"
8454,PREFACE.,"I mean not the goddess Diane,"
8455,PREFACE.,"But Venus' daughter, which that hight DanÃ¨:"""
8456,PREFACE.,
8457,PREFACE.,"Which, after a little consideration, I knew was to be reformed into this"
8458,PREFACE.,"sense, that Daphne, the daughter of Peneus, was turned into a tree. I"
8459,PREFACE.,"durst not make thus bold with Ovid, lest some future Milbourn should"
8460,PREFACE.,"arise, and say I varied from my author because I understood him not."
8461,PREFACE.,
8462,PREFACE.,But there are other judges who think I ought not to have translated
8463,PREFACE.,"Chaucer into English, out of a quite contrary notion. They suppose there"
8464,PREFACE.,"is a certain veneration due to his old language, and that it is little"
8465,PREFACE.,less than profanation and sacrilege to alter it. They are farther of
8466,PREFACE.,"opinion, that somewhat of his good sense will suffer in this"
8467,PREFACE.,"transfusion, and much of the beauty of his thoughts will infallibly be"
8468,PREFACE.,"lost, which appear with more grace in their old habit. Of this opinion"
8469,PREFACE.,"was that excellent person whom I mentioned, the late Earl of Leicester,"
8470,PREFACE.,who valued Chaucer as much as Mr Cowley despised him. My lord dissuaded
8471,PREFACE.,me from this attempt (for I was thinking of it some years before his
8472,PREFACE.,"death), and his authority prevailed so far with me, as to defer my"
8473,PREFACE.,"undertaking while he lived, in deference to him; yet my reason was not"
8474,PREFACE.,convinced with what he urged against it. If the first end of a writer be
8475,PREFACE.,"to be understood, then, as his language grows obsolete, his thoughts"
8476,PREFACE.,"must grow obscure: _multa renascentur quÃ¦ nunc cecidere, cadentque,"
8477,PREFACE.,"quÃ¦ nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus, quem penes arbitrium"
8478,PREFACE.,est et jus et norma loquendi._ When an ancient word for its sound and
8479,PREFACE.,"significancy deserves to be revived, I have that reasonable veneration"
8480,PREFACE.,for antiquity to restore it. All beyond this is superstition. Words are
8481,PREFACE.,"not like landmarks, so sacred as never to be removed; customs are"
8482,PREFACE.,"changed, and even statutes are silently repealed, when the reason ceases"
8483,PREFACE.,"for which they were enacted. As for the other part of the argument,"
8484,PREFACE.,that his thoughts will lose their original beauty by the innovation of
8485,PREFACE.,"words; in the first place, not only their beauty, but their being is"
8486,PREFACE.,"lost, where they are no longer understood, which is the present case. I"
8487,PREFACE.,"grant that something must be lost in all transfusion, that is, in all"
8488,PREFACE.,"translations; but the sense will remain, which would otherwise be lost,"
8489,PREFACE.,"or at least be maimed, when it is scarce intelligible, and that but to a"
8490,PREFACE.,"few. How few are there who can read Chaucer, so as to understand him"
8491,PREFACE.,"perfectly! And if imperfectly, then with less profit and no pleasure."
8492,PREFACE.,'Tis not for the use of some old Saxon friends that I have taken these
8493,PREFACE.,"pains with him: let them neglect my version, because they have no need"
8494,PREFACE.,of it. I made it for their sakes who understand sense and poetry as well
8495,PREFACE.,"as they, when that poetry and sense is put into words which they"
8496,PREFACE.,"understand. I will go further, and dare to add, that what beauties I"
8497,PREFACE.,"lose in some places, I give to others which had them not originally; but"
8498,PREFACE.,"in this I may be partial to myself; let the reader judge, and I submit"
8499,PREFACE.,"to his decision. Yet I think I have just occasion to complain of them,"
8500,PREFACE.,"who, because they understand Chaucer, would deprive the greater part of"
8501,PREFACE.,"their countrymen of the same advantage, and hoard him up, as misers do"
8502,PREFACE.,"their grandam, gold, only to look on it themselves, and hinder others"
8503,PREFACE.,"from making use of it. In sum, I seriously protest that no man ever had,"
8504,PREFACE.,"or can have, a greater veneration for Chaucer than myself. I have"
8505,PREFACE.,"translated some part of his works, only that I might perpetuate his"
8506,PREFACE.,"memory, or at least refresh it, amongst my countrymen. If I have altered"
8507,PREFACE.,"him anywhere for the better, I must at the same time acknowledge that I"
8508,PREFACE.,could have done nothing without him: _Facile est inventis addere_ is no
8509,PREFACE.,"great commendation, and I am not so vain to think I have deserved a"
8510,PREFACE.,"greater. I will conclude what I have to say of him singly, with this one"
8511,PREFACE.,"remark: a lady of my acquaintance, who keeps a kind of correspondence"
8512,PREFACE.,"with some authors of the fair sex in France, has been informed by them"
8513,PREFACE.,"that Mademoiselle de Scudery, who is as old as Sibyl, and inspired like"
8514,PREFACE.,"her by the same god of poetry, is at this time translating Chaucer into"
8515,PREFACE.,modern French; from which I gather that he has been formerly translated
8516,PREFACE.,"into the old ProvenÃ§al, (for how she should come to understand old"
8517,PREFACE.,"English I know not). But the matter of fact being true, it makes me"
8518,PREFACE.,"think that there is something in it like fatality; that, after certain"
8519,PREFACE.,"periods of time, the fame and memory of great wits should be renewed, as"
8520,PREFACE.,"Chaucer is both in France and England. If this be wholly chance, 'tis"
8521,PREFACE.,"extraordinary, and I dare not call it more for fear of being taxed with"
8522,PREFACE.,superstition.
8523,PREFACE.,
8524,PREFACE.,"Boccace comes last to be considered, who, living in the same age with"
8525,PREFACE.,"Chaucer, had the same genius, and followed the same studies. Both writ"
8526,PREFACE.,"novels, and each of them cultivated his mother tongue. But the greatest"
8527,PREFACE.,"resemblance of our two modern authors being in their familiar style, and"
8528,PREFACE.,"pleasing way of relating comical adventures, I may pass it over, because"
8529,PREFACE.,I have translated nothing from Boccace of that nature. In the serious
8530,PREFACE.,"part of poetry, the advantage is wholly on Chaucer's side; for though"
8531,PREFACE.,"the Englishman has borrowed many tales from the Italian, yet it appears"
8532,PREFACE.,"that those of Boccace were not generally of his own making, but taken"
8533,PREFACE.,"from authors of former ages, and by him only modelled; so that what"
8534,PREFACE.,there was of invention in either of them may be judged equal. But
8535,PREFACE.,"Chaucer has refined on Boccace, and has mended the stories which he has"
8536,PREFACE.,"borrowed, in his way of telling; though prose allows more liberty of"
8537,PREFACE.,"thought, and the expression is more easy when unconfined by numbers."
8538,PREFACE.,"Our countryman carries weight, and yet wins the race at disadvantage. I"
8539,PREFACE.,"desire not the reader should take my word, and, therefore, I will set"
8540,PREFACE.,"two of their discourses on the same subject, in the same light, for"
8541,PREFACE.,"every man to judge betwixt them. I translated Chaucer first, and,"
8542,PREFACE.,"amongst the rest, pitched on the Wife of Bath's tale, not daring, as I"
8543,PREFACE.,"have said, to adventure on her prologue, because it is too licentious."
8544,PREFACE.,"There Chaucer introduces an old woman of mean parentage, whom a youthful"
8545,PREFACE.,"knight of noble blood was forced to marry, and consequently loathed her."
8546,PREFACE.,"The crone being in bed with him on the wedding night, and finding his"
8547,PREFACE.,"aversion, endeavours to win his affection by reason, and speaks a good"
8548,PREFACE.,"word for herself, (as who could blame her?) in hope to mollify the"
8549,PREFACE.,"sullen bridegroom. She takes her topics from the benefits of poverty,"
8550,PREFACE.,"the advantages of old age and ugliness, the vanity of youth, and the"
8551,PREFACE.,"silly pride of ancestry and titles without inherent virtue, which is the"
8552,PREFACE.,true nobility. When I had closed Chaucer I returned to Ovid and
8553,PREFACE.,"translated some more of his fables, and by this time had so far"
8554,PREFACE.,"forgotten the Wife of Bath's tale, that, when I took up Boccace,"
8555,PREFACE.,unawares I fell on the same argument of preferring virtue to nobility of
8556,PREFACE.,"blood and titles, in the story of Sigismunda, which I had certainly"
8557,PREFACE.,"avoided for the resemblance of the two discourses, if my memory had not"
8558,PREFACE.,"failed me. Let the reader weigh them both, and if he thinks me partial"
8559,PREFACE.,"to Chaucer, it is in him to right Boccace."
8560,PREFACE.,
8561,PREFACE.,"I prefer in our countryman, far above all his other stories, the noble"
8562,PREFACE.,"poem of Palamon and Arcite, which is of the Epic kind, and perhaps not"
8563,PREFACE.,"much inferior to the Ilias, or the Ãneis. The story is more pleasing"
8564,PREFACE.,"than either of them, the manners as perfect, the diction as poetical,"
8565,PREFACE.,"the learning as deep and various, and the disposition full as"
8566,PREFACE.,"artful,--only it includes a greater length of time, as taking up seven"
8567,PREFACE.,years at least; but Aristotle has left undecided the duration of the
8568,PREFACE.,"action, which, yet, is easily reduced into the compass of a year by a"
8569,PREFACE.,narration of what preceded the return of Palamon to Athens. I had
8570,PREFACE.,"thought, for the honour of our nation, and more particularly for his,"
8571,PREFACE.,"whose laurel, though unworthy, I have worn after him, that this story"
8572,PREFACE.,"was of English growth, and Chaucer's own; but I was undeceived by"
8573,PREFACE.,"Boccace, for, casually looking on the end of his seventh Giornata, I"
8574,PREFACE.,found Dioneo (under which name he shadows himself) and Fiametta (who
8575,PREFACE.,"represents his mistress, the natural daughter of Robert king of Naples)"
8576,PREFACE.,of whom these words are spoken: _Dioneo e la Fiametta granpezza
8577,PREFACE.,contarono insieme d'Arcita e di Palamone_: by which it appears that this
8578,PREFACE.,"story was written before the time of Boccace, but the name of its author"
8579,PREFACE.,"being wholly lost, Chaucer is now become an original, and I question not"
8580,PREFACE.,but the poem has received many beauties by passing through his noble
8581,PREFACE.,"hands. Besides this tale, there is another of his own invention, after"
8582,PREFACE.,"the manner of the ProvenÃ§als, called ""The Flower and the Leaf,"" with"
8583,PREFACE.,"which I was so particularly pleased, both for the invention and the"
8584,PREFACE.,"moral, that I cannot hinder myself from recommending it to the reader."
8585,PREFACE.,
8586,PREFACE.,"As a corollary to this preface, in which I have done justice to others,"
8587,PREFACE.,I owe somewhat to myself: not that I think it worth my time to enter the
8588,PREFACE.,"lists with one Milbourn, and one Blackmore, but barely to take notice,"
8589,PREFACE.,"that such men there are, who have written scurrilously against me"
8590,PREFACE.,"without any provocation. Milbourn, who is in orders, pretends, amongst"
8591,PREFACE.,"the rest, this quarrel to me, that I have fallen foul on priesthood. If"
8592,PREFACE.,"I have, I am only to ask pardon of good priests, and am afraid his part"
8593,PREFACE.,of the reparation will come to little. Let him be satisfied that he
8594,PREFACE.,shall not be able to force himself upon me for an adversary. I contemn
8595,PREFACE.,him too much to enter into competition with him. His own translations of
8596,PREFACE.,Virgil have answered his criticisms on mine. If (as they say he has
8597,PREFACE.,"declared in print) he prefers the version of Ogilby to mine, the world"
8598,PREFACE.,has made him the same compliment: for it is agreed on all hands that he
8599,PREFACE.,"writes even below Ogilby: that, you will say, is not easily to be done;"
8600,PREFACE.,"but what cannot Milbourn bring about? I am satisfied, however, that"
8601,PREFACE.,"while he and I live together, I shall not be thought the worst poet of"
8602,PREFACE.,the age. It looks as if I had desired him underhand to write so ill
8603,PREFACE.,against me; but upon my honest word I have not bribed him to do me this
8604,PREFACE.,"service, and am wholly guiltless of his pamphlet. 'Tis true, I should be"
8605,PREFACE.,"glad, if I could persuade him to continue his good offices, and write"
8606,PREFACE.,such another critique on any thing of mine; for I find by experience he
8607,PREFACE.,"has a great stroke with the reader, when he condemns any of my poems, to"
8608,PREFACE.,make the world have a better opinion of them. He has taken some pains
8609,PREFACE.,with my poetry; but nobody will be persuaded to take the same with his.
8610,PREFACE.,"If I had taken to the church (as he affirms, but which was never in my"
8611,PREFACE.,"thoughts), I should have had more sense, if not more grace, than to have"
8612,PREFACE.,turned myself out of my benefice by writing libels on my parishioners.
8613,PREFACE.,But his account of my manners and my principles are of a piece with his
8614,PREFACE.,cavils and his poetry; and so I have done with him for ever.
8615,PREFACE.,
8616,PREFACE.,"As for the City Bard, or Knight Physician, I hear his quarrel to me is,"
8617,PREFACE.,"that I was the author of Absalom and Achitophel, which he thinks is a"
8618,PREFACE.,little hard on his fanatic patrons in London.
8619,PREFACE.,
8620,PREFACE.,"But I will deal the more civilly with his two poems, because nothing ill"
8621,PREFACE.,is to be spoken of the dead; and therefore peace be to the manes of his
8622,PREFACE.,"Arthurs! I will only say, that it was not for this noble knight that I"
8623,PREFACE.,"drew the plan of an Epic poem on King Arthur, in my preface to the"
8624,PREFACE.,translation of Juvenal. The guardian angels of kingdoms were machines
8625,PREFACE.,"too ponderous for him to manage; and therefore he rejected them, as"
8626,PREFACE.,"Dares did the whirlbats of Eryx, when they were thrown before him by"
8627,PREFACE.,Entellus. Yet from that preface he plainly took his hint; for he began
8628,PREFACE.,"immediately upon the story, though he had the baseness not to"
8629,PREFACE.,"acknowledge his benefactor, but instead of it, to traduce me in a libel."
8630,PREFACE.,
8631,PREFACE.,"I shall say the less of Mr Collier, because in many things he has taxed"
8632,PREFACE.,me justly; and I have pleaded guilty to all thoughts and expressions of
8633,PREFACE.,"mine, which can be truly argued of obscenity, profaneness, or"
8634,PREFACE.,"immorality; and retract them. If he be my enemy, let him triumph; if he"
8635,PREFACE.,"be my friend, as I have given him no personal occasion to be otherwise,"
8636,PREFACE.,he will be glad of my repentance. It becomes me not to draw my pen in
8637,PREFACE.,"the defence of a bad cause, when I have so often drawn it for a good"
8638,PREFACE.,"one. Yet it were not difficult to prove, that in many places he has"
8639,PREFACE.,perverted my meaning by his glosses; and interpreted my words into

8643,PREFACE.,eaten him up; but I am sure it has devoured some part of his
8644,PREFACE.,good-manners and civility. It might also be doubted whether it were
8645,PREFACE.,altogether zeal which prompted him to this rough manner of proceeding:
8646,PREFACE.,perhaps it became not one of his function to rake into the rubbish of
8647,PREFACE.,ancient and modern plays: a divine might have employed his pains to
8648,PREFACE.,better purpose than in the nastiness of Plautus and Aristophanes; whose
8649,PREFACE.,"examples, as they excuse not me, so it might be possibly supposed that"
8650,PREFACE.,he read them not without some pleasure. They who have written
8651,PREFACE.,"commentaries on those poets, or on Horace, Juvenal, and Martial, have"
8652,PREFACE.,"explained some vices, which without their interpretation had been"

8667,PREFACE.,erect myself into a judge. As for the rest of those who have written
8668,PREFACE.,"against me, they are such scoundrels, that they deserve not the least"

8993,BOOK I.,"He said no more, but, shunning all delay,"
8994,BOOK I.,Rode on; nor enter'd Athens on his way:
8995,BOOK I.,"But left his sister and his queen behind,"
8996,BOOK I.,And waved his royal banner in the wind:
8997,BOOK I.,Where in an argent field the god of war
8998,BOOK I.,Was drawn triumphant on his iron car;                              110
8999,BOOK I.,"Red was his sword, and shield, and whole attire,"
9000,BOOK I.,And all the godhead seem'd to glow with fire;
9001,BOOK I.,"Even the ground glitter'd where the standard flew,"
9002,BOOK I.,And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue.
9003,BOOK I.,High on his pointed lance his pennon bore
9004,BOOK I.,"His Cretan fight, the conquer'd Minotaur:"
9005,BOOK I.,"The soldiers shout around with generous rage,"
9006,BOOK I.,And in that victory their own presage.
9007,BOOK I.,He praised their ardour: inly pleased to see
9008,BOOK I.,"His host the flower of Grecian chivalry,                           120"
9009,BOOK I.,"All day he march'd, and all the ensuing night,"
9010,BOOK I.,And saw the city with returning light.
9011,BOOK I.,"The process of the war I need not tell,"
9012,BOOK I.,"How Theseus conquer'd, and how Creon fell:"
9013,BOOK I.,"Or after, how by storm the walls were won,"
9014,BOOK I.,Or how the victor sack'd and burn'd the town:
9015,BOOK I.,How to the ladies he restored again
9016,BOOK I.,The bodies of their lords in battle slain:
9017,BOOK I.,And with what ancient rites they were interr'd;
9018,BOOK I.,All these to fitter times shall be deferr'd.                       130
9019,BOOK I.,"I spare the widows' tears, their woeful cries,"
9020,BOOK I.,And howling at their husbands' obsequies;
9021,BOOK I.,"How Theseus at these funerals did assist,"
9022,BOOK I.,And with what gifts the mourning dames dismiss'd.
9023,BOOK I.,
9024,BOOK I.,"Thus when the victor chief had Creon slain,"
9025,BOOK I.,"And conquer'd Thebes, he pitch'd upon the plain"
9026,BOOK I.,"His mighty camp, and, when the day return'd,"
9027,BOOK I.,"The country wasted, and the hamlets burn'd,"
9028,BOOK I.,"And left the pillagers, to rapine bred,"
9029,BOOK I.,Without control to strip and spoil the dead.                       140
9030,BOOK I.,
9031,BOOK I.,"There, in a heap of slain, among the rest"
9032,BOOK I.,Two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppress'd
9033,BOOK I.,"Of slaughter'd foes, whom first to death they sent--"
9034,BOOK I.,"The trophies of their strength, a bloody monument."
9035,BOOK I.,"Both fair, and both of royal blood they seem'd,"
9036,BOOK I.,Whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deem'd;
9037,BOOK I.,That day in equal arms they fought for fame;
9038,BOOK I.,"Their swords, their shields, their surcoats were the same."
9039,BOOK I.,"Close by each other laid, they press'd the ground,"
9040,BOOK I.,Their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound;               150
9041,BOOK I.,"Nor well alive, nor wholly dead they were,"
9042,BOOK I.,But some faint signs of feeble life appear:
9043,BOOK I.,"The wandering breath was on the wing to part,"
9044,BOOK I.,"Weak was the pulse, and hardly heaved the heart."
9045,BOOK I.,These two were sisters' sons; and Arcite one
9046,BOOK I.,"Much famed in fields, with valiant Palamon."
9047,BOOK I.,"From these their costly arms the spoilers rent,"
9048,BOOK I.,And softly both convey'd to Theseus' tent:
9049,BOOK I.,"Whom, known of Creon's line, and cured with care,"
9050,BOOK I.,"He to his city sent as prisoners of the war,                       160"
9051,BOOK I.,"Hopeless of ransom, and condemn'd to lie"
9052,BOOK I.,"In durance, doom'd a lingering death to die."
9053,BOOK I.,"This done, he march'd away with warlike sound,"
9054,BOOK I.,"And to his Athens turn'd, with laurels crown'd,"
9055,BOOK I.,"Where happy long he lived, much loved, and more renown'd."
9056,BOOK I.,"But in a tower, and never to be loosed,"
9057,BOOK I.,The woful captive kinsmen are enclosed.
9058,BOOK I.,
9059,BOOK I.,"Thus year by year they pass, and day by day,"
9060,BOOK I.,"Till once, 'twas on the morn of cheerful May,"
9061,BOOK I.,"The young Emilia, fairer to be seen                                170"
9062,BOOK I.,"Than the fair lily on the flowery green,"
9063,BOOK I.,"More fresh than May herself in blossoms new,"
9064,BOOK I.,"For with the rosy colour strove her hue,"
9065,BOOK I.,"Waked, as her custom was, before the day,"
9066,BOOK I.,To do the observance due to sprightly May:
9067,BOOK I.,For sprightly May commands our youth to keep
9068,BOOK I.,"The vigils of her night, and breaks their sluggard sleep;"
9069,BOOK I.,Each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves;
9070,BOOK I.,"Inspires new flames, revives extinguish'd loves."
9071,BOOK I.,"In this remembrance, Emily, ere day,                               180"
9072,BOOK I.,"Arose, and dress'd herself in rich array;"
9073,BOOK I.,"Fresh as the month, and as the morning fair:"
9074,BOOK I.,Adown her shoulders fell her length of hair:
9075,BOOK I.,"A riband did the braided tresses bind,"
9076,BOOK I.,The rest was loose and wanton'd in the wind.
9077,BOOK I.,"Aurora had but newly chased the night,"
9078,BOOK I.,"And purpled o'er the sky with blushing light,"
9079,BOOK I.,"When to the garden walk she took her way,"
9080,BOOK I.,"To sport and trip along in cool of day,"
9081,BOOK I.,And offer maiden vows in honour of the May.                        190
9082,BOOK I.,
9083,BOOK I.,"At every turn, she made a little stand,"
9084,BOOK I.,And thrust among the thorns her lily hand
9085,BOOK I.,"To draw the rose, and every rose she drew"
9086,BOOK I.,"She shook the stalk, and brush'd away the dew:"
9087,BOOK I.,Then party-colour'd flowers of white and red
9088,BOOK I.,"She wove, to make a garland for her head:"
9089,BOOK I.,"This done, she sung and caroll'd out so clear,"
9090,BOOK I.,That men and angels might rejoice to hear:
9091,BOOK I.,Even wondering Philomel forgot to sing;
9092,BOOK I.,And learn'd from her to welcome in the spring.                     200
9093,BOOK I.,"The tower, of which before was mention made,"
9094,BOOK I.,"Within whose keep the captive knights were laid,"
9095,BOOK I.,"Built of a large extent, and strong withal,"
9096,BOOK I.,Was one partition of the palace wall;
9097,BOOK I.,The garden was enclosed within the square
9098,BOOK I.,Where young Emilia took the morning air.
9099,BOOK I.,
9100,BOOK I.,"It happen'd Palamon, the prisoner knight,"
9101,BOOK I.,"Restless for woe, arose before the light,"
9102,BOOK I.,And with his jailer's leave desired to breathe
9103,BOOK I.,An air more wholesome than the damps beneath.                      210
9104,BOOK I.,"This granted, to the tower he took his way,"
9105,BOOK I.,Cheer'd with the promise of a glorious day:
9106,BOOK I.,"Then cast a languishing regard around,"
9107,BOOK I.,"And saw, with hateful eyes, the temples crown'd"
9108,BOOK I.,"With golden spires, and all the hostile ground."
9109,BOOK I.,"He sigh'd, and turn'd his eyes, because he knew"
9110,BOOK I.,'Twas but a larger jail he had in view:
9111,BOOK I.,"Then look'd below, and from the castle's height"
9112,BOOK I.,Beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight:
9113,BOOK I.,"The garden, which before he had not seen,                          220"
9114,BOOK I.,"In spring's new livery clad of white and green,"
9115,BOOK I.,"Fresh flowers in wide parterres, and shady walks between."
9116,BOOK I.,"This view'd, but not enjoy'd, with arms across"
9117,BOOK I.,"He stood, reflecting on his country's loss;"
9118,BOOK I.,"Himself an object of the public scorn,"
9119,BOOK I.,And often wish'd he never had been born.
9120,BOOK I.,"At last, for so his destiny required,"
9121,BOOK I.,"With walking giddy, and with thinking tired,"
9122,BOOK I.,"He through a little window cast his sight,"
9123,BOOK I.,"Though thick of bars, that gave a scanty light:                    230"
9124,BOOK I.,But even that glimmering served him to descry
9125,BOOK I.,The inevitable charms of Emily.
9126,BOOK I.,
9127,BOOK I.,"Scarce had he seen, but seized with sudden smart,"
9128,BOOK I.,"Stung to the quick, he felt it at his heart;"
9129,BOOK I.,"Struck blind with overpowering light he stood,"
9130,BOOK I.,"Then started back amazed, and cried aloud."
9131,BOOK I.,
9132,BOOK I.,"Young Arcite heard; and up he ran with haste,"
9133,BOOK I.,"To help his friend, and in his arms embraced;"
9134,BOOK I.,"And ask'd him why he look'd so deadly wan,"
9135,BOOK I.,And whence and how his change of cheer began?                      240
9136,BOOK I.,"Or who had done the offence? But if, said he,"
9137,BOOK I.,Your grief alone is hard captivity;
9138,BOOK I.,"For love of Heaven, with patience undergo"
9139,BOOK I.,"A cureless ill, since Fate will have it so:"
9140,BOOK I.,"So stood our horoscope in chains to lie,"
9141,BOOK I.,"And Saturn in the dungeon of the sky,"
9142,BOOK I.,"Or other baleful aspect, ruled our birth,"
9143,BOOK I.,When all the friendly stars were under earth:
9144,BOOK I.,"Whate'er betides, by Destiny 'tis done;"
9145,BOOK I.,"And better bear like men, than vainly seek to shun.                250"
9146,BOOK I.,"Nor of my bonds, said Palamon again,"
9147,BOOK I.,Nor of unhappy planets I complain;
9148,BOOK I.,"But when my mortal anguish caused my cry,"
9149,BOOK I.,That moment I was hurt through either eye;
9150,BOOK I.,"Pierced with a random shaft, I faint away,"
9151,BOOK I.,And perish with insensible decay;
9152,BOOK I.,"A glance of some new goddess gave the wound,"
9153,BOOK I.,"Whom, like Actaeon, unaware I found."
9154,BOOK I.,Look how she walks along yon shady space!
9155,BOOK I.,Not Juno moves with more majestic grace;                           260
9156,BOOK I.,And all the Cyprian queen is in her face.
9157,BOOK I.,If thou art Venus (for thy charms confess
9158,BOOK I.,"That face was form'd in heaven, nor art thou less"
9159,BOOK I.,"Disguised in habit, undisguised in shape),"
9160,BOOK I.,"Oh, help us captives from our chains to 'scape!"
9161,BOOK I.,But if our doom be past in bonds to lie
9162,BOOK I.,"For life, and in a loathsome dungeon die,"
9163,BOOK I.,"Then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace,"
9164,BOOK I.,"And show compassion to the Theban race,"
9165,BOOK I.,"Oppress'd by tyrant power! While yet he spoke,                     270"
9166,BOOK I.,Arcite on Emily had fix'd his look;
9167,BOOK I.,"The fatal dart a ready passage found,"
9168,BOOK I.,And deep within his heart infix'd the wound:
9169,BOOK I.,"So that if Palamon were wounded sore,"
9170,BOOK I.,"Arcite was hurt as much as he, or more:"
9171,BOOK I.,"Then from his inmost soul he sigh'd, and said,"
9172,BOOK I.,The beauty I behold has struck me dead:
9173,BOOK I.,Unknowingly she strikes; and kills by chance;
9174,BOOK I.,"Poison is in her eyes, and death in every glance."
9175,BOOK I.,"Oh, I must ask; nor ask alone, but move                            280"
9176,BOOK I.,"Her mind to mercy, or must die for love!"
9177,BOOK I.,"Thus Arcite: and thus Palamon replies,"
9178,BOOK I.,(Eager his tone and ardent were his eyes):
9179,BOOK I.,"Speak'st thou in earnest, or in jesting vein?"
9180,BOOK I.,"Jesting, said Arcite, suits but ill with pain."
9181,BOOK I.,"It suits far worse (said Palamon again,"
9182,BOOK I.,"And bent his brows) with men who honour weigh,"
9183,BOOK I.,"Their faith to break, their friendship to betray;"
9184,BOOK I.,"But worst with thee, of noble lineage born,"
9185,BOOK I.,"My kinsman, and in arms my brother sworn.                          290"
9186,BOOK I.,"Have we not plighted each our holy oath,"
9187,BOOK I.,That one should be the common good of both;
9188,BOOK I.,"One soul should both inspire, and neither prove"
9189,BOOK I.,His fellow's hindrance in pursuit of love?
9190,BOOK I.,"To this before the gods we gave our hands,"
9191,BOOK I.,And nothing but our death can break the bands.
9192,BOOK I.,"This binds thee, then, to further my design,"
9193,BOOK I.,As I am bound by vow to further thine:
9194,BOOK I.,"Nor canst, nor dar'st thou, traitor, on the plain"
9195,BOOK I.,"Appeach my honour, or thine own maintain,                          300"
9196,BOOK I.,"Since thou art of my council, and the friend"
9197,BOOK I.,"Whose faith I trust, and on whose care depend:"
9198,BOOK I.,"And would'st thou court my lady's love, which I"
9199,BOOK I.,Much rather than release would choose to die?
9200,BOOK I.,"But thou, false Arcite, never shall obtain"
9201,BOOK I.,Thy bad pretence; I told thee first my pain;
9202,BOOK I.,For first my love began ere thine was born:
9203,BOOK I.,"Thou as my council, and my brother sworn,"
9204,BOOK I.,"Art bound to assist my eldership of right,"
9205,BOOK I.,Or justly to be deem'd a perjured knight.                          310
9206,BOOK I.,
9207,BOOK I.,Thus Palamon: but Arcite with disdain
9208,BOOK I.,In haughty language thus replied again:
9209,BOOK I.,Forsworn thyself: the traitor's odious name
9210,BOOK I.,"I first return, and then disprove thy claim."
9211,BOOK I.,"If love be passion, and that passion nursed"
9212,BOOK I.,"With strong desires, I loved the lady first."
9213,BOOK I.,"Canst thou pretend desire, whom zeal inflamed"
9214,BOOK I.,"To worship, and a power celestial named?"
9215,BOOK I.,"Thine was devotion to the blest above,"
9216,BOOK I.,I saw the woman and desired her love;                              320
9217,BOOK I.,"First own'd my passion, and to thee commend"
9218,BOOK I.,"The important secret, as my chosen friend."
9219,BOOK I.,Suppose (which yet I grant not) thy desire
9220,BOOK I.,A moment elder than my rival fire;
9221,BOOK I.,Can chance of seeing first thy title prove?
9222,BOOK I.,"And know'st thou not, no law is made for love?"
9223,BOOK I.,Law is to things which to free choice relate;
9224,BOOK I.,"Love is not in our choice, but in our fate;"
9225,BOOK I.,"Laws are but positive; love's power, we see,"
9226,BOOK I.,"Is Nature's sanction, and her first decree.                        330"
9227,BOOK I.,Each day we break the bond of human laws
9228,BOOK I.,"For love, and vindicate the common cause."
9229,BOOK I.,"Laws for defence of civil rights are placed,"
9230,BOOK I.,"Love throws the fences down, and makes a general waste;"
9231,BOOK I.,"Maids, widows, wives, without distinction fall;"
9232,BOOK I.,"The sweeping deluge, love, comes on, and covers all."
9233,BOOK I.,"If, then, the laws of friendship I transgress,"
9234,BOOK I.,"I keep the greater, while I break the less;"
9235,BOOK I.,"And both are mad alike, since neither can possess."
9236,BOOK I.,"Both hopeless to be ransom'd, never more                           340"
9237,BOOK I.,"To see the sun, but as he passes o'er."
9238,BOOK I.,
9239,BOOK I.,"Like Ãsop's hounds contending for the bone,"
9240,BOOK I.,"Each pleaded right, and would be lord alone:"
9241,BOOK I.,The fruitless fight continued all the day;
9242,BOOK I.,"A cur came by, and snatch'd the prize away."
9243,BOOK I.,"As courtiers, therefore, jostle for a grant,"
9244,BOOK I.,"And when they break their friendship, plead their want;"
9245,BOOK I.,"So thou, if fortune will thy suit advance,"
9246,BOOK I.,"Love on, nor envy me my equal chance;"
9247,BOOK I.,"For I must love, and am resolved to try                            350"
9248,BOOK I.,"My fate, or, failing in the adventure, die."
9249,BOOK I.,
9250,BOOK I.,"Great was their strife, which hourly was renew'd,"
9251,BOOK I.,Till each with mortal hate his rival view'd;
9252,BOOK I.,"Now friends no more, nor walking hand in hand;"
9253,BOOK I.,"But when they met, they made a surly stand;"
9254,BOOK I.,"And glared like angry lions as they pass'd,"
9255,BOOK I.,And wish'd that every look might be their last.
9256,BOOK I.,
9257,BOOK I.,"It chanced at length, Pirithous came to attend"
9258,BOOK I.,"This worthy Theseus, his familiar friend:"
9259,BOOK I.,"Their love in early infancy began,                                 360"
9260,BOOK I.,And rose as childhood ripen'd into man.
9261,BOOK I.,"Companions of the war; and loved so well,"
9262,BOOK I.,"That when one died, as ancient stories tell,"
9263,BOOK I.,His fellow to redeem him went to Hell.
9264,BOOK I.,
9265,BOOK I.,But to pursue my tale; to welcome home
9266,BOOK I.,His warlike brother is Pirithous come:
9267,BOOK I.,"Arcite of Thebes was known in arms long since,"
9268,BOOK I.,And honour'd by this young Thessalian prince.
9269,BOOK I.,"Theseus, to gratify his friend and guest,"
9270,BOOK I.,"Who made our Arcite's freedom his request,                         370"
9271,BOOK I.,"Restored to liberty the captive knight,"
9272,BOOK I.,But on these hard conditions I recite:
9273,BOOK I.,That if hereafter Arcite should be found
9274,BOOK I.,"Within the compass of Athenian ground,"
9275,BOOK I.,"By day or night, or on whate'er pretence,"
9276,BOOK I.,His head should pay the forfeit of the offence.
9277,BOOK I.,"To this Pirithous for his friend agreed,"
9278,BOOK I.,And on his promise was the prisoner freed.
9279,BOOK I.,
9280,BOOK I.,"Unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way,"
9281,BOOK I.,At his own peril; for his life must pay.                           380
9282,BOOK I.,"Who now but Arcite mourns his bitter fate,"
9283,BOOK I.,"Finds his dear purchase, and repents too late?"
9284,BOOK I.,"What have I gain'd, he said, in prison pent,"
9285,BOOK I.,If I but change my bonds for banishment?
9286,BOOK I.,"And banish'd from her sight, I suffer more"
9287,BOOK I.,In freedom than I felt in bonds before;
9288,BOOK I.,"Forced from her presence, and condemn'd to live:"
9289,BOOK I.,"Unwelcome freedom, and unthank'd reprieve!"
9290,BOOK I.,"Heaven is not, but where Emily abides,"
9291,BOOK I.,"And where she's absent, all is hell besides.                       390"
9292,BOOK I.,"Next to my day of birth, was that accursed,"
9293,BOOK I.,Which bound my friendship to Pirithous first:
9294,BOOK I.,"Had I not known that prince, I still had been"
9295,BOOK I.,"In bondage, and had still Emilia seen:"
9296,BOOK I.,"For though I never can her grace deserve,"
9297,BOOK I.,'Tis recompence enough to see and serve.
9298,BOOK I.,"O Palamon, my kinsman and my friend,"
9299,BOOK I.,How much more happy fates thy love attend!
9300,BOOK I.,Thine is the adventure; thine the victory:
9301,BOOK I.,Well has thy fortune turn'd the dice for thee:                     400
9302,BOOK I.,"Thou on that angel's face may'st feed thine eyes,"
9303,BOOK I.,"In prison, no; but blissful paradise!"
9304,BOOK I.,"Thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine,"
9305,BOOK I.,And lovest at least in love's extremest line.
9306,BOOK I.,"I mourn in absence, love's eternal night;"
9307,BOOK I.,"And who can tell but since thou hast her sight,"
9308,BOOK I.,"And art a comely, young, and valiant knight,"
9309,BOOK I.,"Fortune (a various power) may cease to frown,"
9310,BOOK I.,And by some ways unknown thy wishes crown?

9312,BOOK I.,"Nor help can hope, nor remedy can find;"
9313,BOOK I.,"But doom'd to drag my loathsome life in care,"
9314,BOOK I.,"For my reward, must end it in despair."
9315,BOOK I.,"Fire, water, air, and earth, and force of fates,"

9323,BOOK I.,"Of fortune, fate, or Providence complain?"
9324,BOOK I.,"God gives us what he knows our wants require,"

9326,BOOK I.,Some pray for riches; riches they obtain;
9327,BOOK I.,"But, watch'd by robbers, for their wealth are slain:"
9328,BOOK I.,"Some pray from prison to be freed; and come,"
9329,BOOK I.,"When guilty of their vows, to fall at home;"
9330,BOOK I.,"Murder'd by those they trusted with their life,"
9331,BOOK I.,"A favour'd servant, or a bosom wife."
9332,BOOK I.,"Such dear-bought blessings happen every day,                       430"
9333,BOOK I.,Because we know not for what things to pray.
9334,BOOK I.,Like drunken sots about the street we roam;
9335,BOOK I.,Well knows the sot he has a certain home;
9336,BOOK I.,"Yet knows not how to find the uncertain place,"
9337,BOOK I.,"And blunders on, and staggers every pace."
9338,BOOK I.,Thus all seek happiness; but few can find.
9339,BOOK I.,For far the greater part of men are blind.
9340,BOOK I.,"This is my case, who thought our utmost good"
9341,BOOK I.,Was in one word of freedom understood:
9342,BOOK I.,"The fatal blessing came: from prison free,                         440"
9343,BOOK I.,"I starve abroad, and lose the sight of Emily."
9344,BOOK I.,
9345,BOOK I.,Thus Arcite; but if Arcite thus deplore
9346,BOOK I.,"His sufferings, Palamon yet suffers more."
9347,BOOK I.,"For when he knew his rival freed and gone,"
9348,BOOK I.,He swells with wrath; he makes outrageous moan:
9349,BOOK I.,"He frets, he fumes, he stares, he stamps the ground;"
9350,BOOK I.,The hollow tower with clamours rings around:
9351,BOOK I.,"With briny tears he bathed his fetter'd feet,"
9352,BOOK I.,And dropp'd all o'er with agony of sweat.
9353,BOOK I.,"Alas! he cried, I wretch in prison pine,                           450"
9354,BOOK I.,"Too happy rival, while the fruit is thine:"
9355,BOOK I.,"Thou livest at large, thou draw'st thy native air,"
9356,BOOK I.,"Pleased with thy freedom, proud of my despair:"
9357,BOOK I.,"Thou may'st, since thou hast youth and courage join'd,"
9358,BOOK I.,"A sweet behaviour and a solid mind,"
9359,BOOK I.,"Assemble ours, and all the Theban race,"
9360,BOOK I.,To vindicate on Athens thy disgrace;
9361,BOOK I.,"And after, by some treaty made, possess"
9362,BOOK I.,"Fair Emily, the pledge of lasting peace."
9363,BOOK I.,"So thine shall be the beauteous prize, while I                     460"
9364,BOOK I.,"Must languish in despair, in prison die."
9365,BOOK I.,"Thus all the advantage of the strife is thine,"
9366,BOOK I.,"Thy portion double joys, and double sorrows mine."
9367,BOOK I.,
9368,BOOK I.,"The rage of jealousy then fired his soul,"
9369,BOOK I.,And his face kindled like a burning coal:
9370,BOOK I.,"Now cold despair, succeeding in her stead,"
9371,BOOK I.,To livid paleness turns the glowing red.
9372,BOOK I.,"His blood, scarce liquid, creeps within his veins,"
9373,BOOK I.,Like water which the freezing wind constrains.
9374,BOOK I.,"Then thus he said: Eternal Deities,                                470"
9375,BOOK I.,"Who rule the world with absolute decrees,"
9376,BOOK I.,"And write whatever time shall bring to pass,"
9377,BOOK I.,With pens of adamant on plates of brass;
9378,BOOK I.,"What! is the race of human kind your care,"
9379,BOOK I.,Beyond what all his fellow-creatures are?
9380,BOOK I.,"He with the rest is liable to pain,"
9381,BOOK I.,"And like the sheep, his brother-beast, is slain;"
9382,BOOK I.,"Cold, hunger, prisons, ills without a cure,"
9383,BOOK I.,"All these he must, and guiltless, oft endure."
9384,BOOK I.,"Or does your justice, power, or prescience fail,                   480"
9385,BOOK I.,"When the good suffer, and the bad prevail?"
9386,BOOK I.,"What worse to wretched virtue could befall,"
9387,BOOK I.,If fate or giddy fortune govern'd all?
9388,BOOK I.,"Nay, worse than other beasts is our estate;"
9389,BOOK I.,"Them, to pursue their pleasures, you create;"
9390,BOOK I.,"We, bound by harder laws, must curb our will,"
9391,BOOK I.,"And your commands, not our desires, fulfil;"
9392,BOOK I.,"Then when the creature is unjustly slain,"
9393,BOOK I.,"Yet after death, at least, he feels no pain;"
9394,BOOK I.,"But man, in life surcharged with woe before,                       490"
9395,BOOK I.,"Not freed when dead, is doom'd to suffer more."
9396,BOOK I.,A serpent shoots his sting at unaware;
9397,BOOK I.,An ambush'd thief forelays a traveller:
9398,BOOK I.,"The man lies murder'd, while the thief and snake,"
9399,BOOK I.,"One gains the thickets, and one threads the brake."
9400,BOOK I.,"This let divines decide; but well I know,"
9401,BOOK I.,"Just, or unjust, I have my share of woe,"
9402,BOOK I.,"Through Saturn seated in a luckless place,"
9403,BOOK I.,"And Juno's wrath, that persecutes my race;"
9404,BOOK I.,"Or Mars and Venus, in a quartile, move                             500"
9405,BOOK I.,My pangs of jealousy for Arcite's love.
9406,BOOK I.,
9407,BOOK I.,"Let Palamon oppress'd in bondage mourn,"
9408,BOOK I.,While to his exiled rival we return.
9409,BOOK I.,"By this, the sun, declining from his height,"
9410,BOOK I.,The day had shorten'd to prolong the night;
9411,BOOK I.,The lengthen'd night gave length of misery
9412,BOOK I.,Both to the captive lover and the free.
9413,BOOK I.,"For Palamon in endless prison mourns,"
9414,BOOK I.,And Arcite forfeits life if he returns:
9415,BOOK I.,"The banish'd never hopes his love to see,                          510"
9416,BOOK I.,Nor hopes the captive lord his liberty.
9417,BOOK I.,'Tis hard to say who suffers greater pains:
9418,BOOK I.,"One sees his love, but cannot break his chains:"
9419,BOOK I.,"One free, and all his motions uncontroll'd,"
9420,BOOK I.,"Beholds whate'er he would, but what he would behold."
9421,BOOK I.,"Judge as you please, for I will haste to tell"
9422,BOOK I.,What fortune to the banish'd knight befell.
9423,BOOK I.,
9424,BOOK I.,"When Arcite was to Thebes return'd again,"
9425,BOOK I.,The loss of her he loved renew'd his pain;
9426,BOOK I.,"What could be worse, than never more to see                        520"
9427,BOOK I.,"His life, his soul, his charming Emily?"
9428,BOOK I.,"He raved with all the madness of despair,"
9429,BOOK I.,"He roar'd, he beat his breast, he tore his hair."
9430,BOOK I.,"Dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears,"
9431,BOOK I.,"For, wanting nourishment, he wanted tears:"
9432,BOOK I.,"His eye-balls in their hollow sockets sink,"
9433,BOOK I.,"Bereft of sleep, he loathes his meat and drink."
9434,BOOK I.,"He withers at his heart, and looks as wan"
9435,BOOK I.,As the pale spectre of a murder'd man:
9436,BOOK I.,"That pale turns yellow, and his face receives                      530"
9437,BOOK I.,The faded hue of sapless boxen leaves:
9438,BOOK I.,"In solitary groves he makes his moan,"
9439,BOOK I.,"Walks early out, and ever is alone:"
9440,BOOK I.,"Nor, mix'd in mirth, in youthful pleasures shares,"
9441,BOOK I.,But sighs when songs and instruments he hears.
9442,BOOK I.,"His spirits are so low, his voice is drown'd,"
9443,BOOK I.,"He hears as from afar, or in a swound,"
9444,BOOK I.,Like the deaf murmurs of a distant sound:
9445,BOOK I.,"Uncomb'd his locks and squalid his attire,"
9446,BOOK I.,Unlike the trim of love and gay desire;                            540
9447,BOOK I.,"But full of museful mopings, which presage"
9448,BOOK I.,"The loss of reason, and conclude in rage."
9449,BOOK I.,
9450,BOOK I.,"This when he had endured a year and more,"
9451,BOOK I.,"Now wholly changed from what he was before,"
9452,BOOK I.,"It happen'd once, that, slumbering as he lay,"
9453,BOOK I.,He dream'd (his dream began at break of day)
9454,BOOK I.,"That Hermes o'er his head in air appear'd,"
9455,BOOK I.,And with soft words his drooping spirits cheer'd:
9456,BOOK I.,"His hat, adorn'd with wings, disclosed the god,"
9457,BOOK I.,And in his hand he bore the sleep-compelling rod:                  550
9458,BOOK I.,"Such as he seem'd, when, at his sire's command,"
9459,BOOK I.,On Argus' head he laid the snaky wand.
9460,BOOK I.,"Arise, he said, to conquering Athens go,"
9461,BOOK I.,There fate appoints an end to all thy woe.
9462,BOOK I.,"The fright awaken'd Arcite with a start,"
9463,BOOK I.,Against his bosom bounced his heaving heart;
9464,BOOK I.,"But soon he said, with scarce-recover'd breath,"
9465,BOOK I.,"And thither will I go, to meet my death."
9466,BOOK I.,"Sure to be slain; but death is my desire,"
9467,BOOK I.,Since in Emilia's sight I shall expire.                            560
9468,BOOK I.,"By chance he spied a mirror while he spoke,"
9469,BOOK I.,"And gazing there, beheld his alter'd look;"
9470,BOOK I.,"Wondering, he saw his features and his hue"
9471,BOOK I.,"So much were changed, that scarce himself he knew."
9472,BOOK I.,"A sudden thought then starting in his mind,"
9473,BOOK I.,"Since I in Arcite cannot Arcite find,"
9474,BOOK I.,"The world may search in vain with all their eyes,"
9475,BOOK I.,But never penetrate through this disguise.
9476,BOOK I.,"Thanks to the change which grief and sickness give,"
9477,BOOK I.,"In low estate I may securely live,                                 570"
9478,BOOK I.,And see unknown my mistress day by day.
9479,BOOK I.,He said; and clothed himself in coarse array:
9480,BOOK I.,"A labouring hind in show; then forth he went,"
9481,BOOK I.,And to the Athenian towers his journey bent:
9482,BOOK I.,"One squire attended in the same disguise,"
9483,BOOK I.,Made conscious of his master's enterprise.
9484,BOOK I.,"Arrived at Athens, soon he came to court,"
9485,BOOK I.,"Unknown, unquestion'd in that thick resort:"
9486,BOOK I.,"Proffering for hire his service at the gate,"
9487,BOOK I.,"To drudge, draw water, and to run or wait.                         580"
9488,BOOK I.,
9489,BOOK I.,"So fair befell him, that for little gain"
9490,BOOK I.,He served at first Emilia's chamberlain;
9491,BOOK I.,"And, watchful all advantages to spy,"
9492,BOOK I.,"Was still at hand, and in his master's eye;"
9493,BOOK I.,"And as his bones were big, and sinews strong,"
9494,BOOK I.,Refused no toil that could to slaves belong;
9495,BOOK I.,"But from deep wells with engines water drew,"
9496,BOOK I.,And used his noble hands the wood to hew.
9497,BOOK I.,He pass'd a year at least attending thus
9498,BOOK I.,"On Emily, and call'd Philostratus.                                 590"
9499,BOOK I.,But never was there man of his degree
9500,BOOK I.,"So much esteem'd, so well beloved as he."
9501,BOOK I.,"So gentle of condition was he known,"
9502,BOOK I.,That through the court his courtesy was blown:
9503,BOOK I.,"All think him worthy of a greater place,"
9504,BOOK I.,And recommend him to the royal grace;
9505,BOOK I.,"That, exercised within a higher sphere,"
9506,BOOK I.,His virtues more conspicuous might appear.
9507,BOOK I.,"Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised,"
9508,BOOK I.,And by great Theseus to high favour raised;                        600
9509,BOOK I.,"Among his menial servants first enroll'd,"
9510,BOOK I.,And largely entertain'd with sums of gold:
9511,BOOK I.,"Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent,"
9512,BOOK I.,"Of his own income, and his annual rent:"
9513,BOOK I.,"This well employ'd, he purchased friends and fame,"
9514,BOOK I.,But cautiously conceal'd from whence it came.
9515,BOOK I.,"Thus for three years he lived with large increase,"
9516,BOOK I.,"In arms of honour, and esteem in peace;"
9517,BOOK I.,To Theseus' person he was ever near;
9518,BOOK I.,And Theseus for his virtues held him dear.                         610

9521,BOOK II.,BOOK II.
9522,BOOK II.,
9523,BOOK II.,
9524,BOOK II.,"While Arcite lives in bliss, the story turns"
9525,BOOK II.,Where hopeless Palamon in prison mourns.
9526,BOOK II.,"For six long years immured, the captive knight"
9527,BOOK II.,"Had dragg'd his chains, and scarcely seen the light:"
9528,BOOK II.,Lost liberty and love at once he bore:
9529,BOOK II.,"His prison pain'd him much, his passion more:"
9530,BOOK II.,"Nor dares he hope his fetters to remove,"
9531,BOOK II.,Nor ever wishes to be free from love.
9532,BOOK II.,
9533,BOOK II.,"But when the sixth revolving year was run,"
9534,BOOK II.,"And May within the Twins received the sun,                          10"
9535,BOOK II.,"Were it by chance, or forceful destiny,"
9536,BOOK II.,"Which forms in causes first whate'er shall be,"
9537,BOOK II.,"Assisted by a friend, one moonless night,"
9538,BOOK II.,This Palamon from prison took his flight:
9539,BOOK II.,A pleasant beverage he prepared before
9540,BOOK II.,"Of wine and honey, mix'd with added store"
9541,BOOK II.,"Of opium; to his keeper this he brought,"
9542,BOOK II.,"Who swallow'd unaware the sleepy draught,"
9543,BOOK II.,"And snored secure till morn, his senses bound"
9544,BOOK II.,"In slumber, and in long oblivion drown'd.                           20"
9545,BOOK II.,"Short was the night, and careful Palamon"
9546,BOOK II.,Sought the next covert e'er the rising sun.
9547,BOOK II.,"A thick-spread forest near the city lay,"
9548,BOOK II.,"To this with lengthen'd strides he took his way,"
9549,BOOK II.,"(For far he could not fly, and fear'd the day)."
9550,BOOK II.,"Safe from pursuit, he meant to shun the light,"
9551,BOOK II.,Till the brown shadows of the friendly night
9552,BOOK II.,To Thebes might favour his intended flight.
9553,BOOK II.,"When to his country come, his next design"
9554,BOOK II.,"Was all the Theban race in arms to join,                            30"
9555,BOOK II.,"And war on Theseus, till he lost his life,"
9556,BOOK II.,Or won the beauteous Emily to wife.
9557,BOOK II.,
9558,BOOK II.,"Thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile,"
9559,BOOK II.,To gentle Arcite let us turn our style;
9560,BOOK II.,"Who little dreamt how nigh he was to care,"
9561,BOOK II.,Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare.
9562,BOOK II.,"The morning lark, the messenger of day,"
9563,BOOK II.,Saluted in her song the morning gray;
9564,BOOK II.,"And soon the sun arose with beams so bright,"
9565,BOOK II.,That all the horizon laugh'd to see the joyous sight:               40
9566,BOOK II.,"He with his tepid rays the rose renews,"
9567,BOOK II.,"And licks the drooping leaves, and dries the dews;"
9568,BOOK II.,"When Arcite left his bed, resolved to pay"
9569,BOOK II.,Observance to the month of merry May:
9570,BOOK II.,"Forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode,"
9571,BOOK II.,That scarcely prints the turf on which he trode:
9572,BOOK II.,"At ease he seem'd, and, prancing o'er the plains,"
9573,BOOK II.,"Turn'd only to the grove his horse's reins,"
9574,BOOK II.,"The grove I named before; and, lighted there,"
9575,BOOK II.,A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair;                        50
9576,BOOK II.,"Then turn'd his face against the rising day,"
9577,BOOK II.,And raised his voice to welcome in the May.
9578,BOOK II.,
9579,BOOK II.,"For thee, sweet month! the groves green liveries wear,"
9580,BOOK II.,"If not the first, the fairest of the year:"
9581,BOOK II.,"For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours,"
9582,BOOK II.,And Nature's ready pencil paints the flowers:
9583,BOOK II.,"When thy short reign is past, the feverish sun"
9584,BOOK II.,"The sultry tropic fears, and moves more slowly on."
9585,BOOK II.,"So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight,"
9586,BOOK II.,"Nor goats with venom'd teeth thy tendrils bite,                     60"
9587,BOOK II.,As thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find
9588,BOOK II.,"The fragrant greens I seek, my brows to bind."
9589,BOOK II.,
9590,BOOK II.,"His vows address'd, within the grove he stray'd,"
9591,BOOK II.,"Till Fate, or Fortune, near the place convey'd"
9592,BOOK II.,"His steps where, secret, Palamon was laid."
9593,BOOK II.,"Full little thought of him the gentle knight,"
9594,BOOK II.,"Who, flying death, had there conceal'd his flight,"
9595,BOOK II.,"In brakes and brambles hid, and shunning mortal sight:"
9596,BOOK II.,"And less he knew him for his hated foe,"
9597,BOOK II.,But fear'd him as a man he did not know.                            70
9598,BOOK II.,"But as it has been said of ancient years,"
9599,BOOK II.,"That fields are full of eyes, and woods have ears;"
9600,BOOK II.,"For this the wise are ever on their guard,"
9601,BOOK II.,"For, unforeseen, they say, is unprepared."
9602,BOOK II.,"Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone,"
9603,BOOK II.,"And less than all suspected Palamon,"
9604,BOOK II.,"Who, listening, heard him, while he search'd the grove,"
9605,BOOK II.,And loudly sung his roundelay of love:
9606,BOOK II.,"But on the sudden stopp'd, and silent stood,"
9607,BOOK II.,"As lovers often muse, and change their mood;                        80"
9608,BOOK II.,"Now high as heaven, and then as low as hell;"
9609,BOOK II.,"Now up, now down, as buckets in a well:"
9610,BOOK II.,"For Venus, like her day, will change her cheer,"
9611,BOOK II.,And seldom shall we see a Friday clear.
9612,BOOK II.,"Thus Arcite having sung, with alter'd hue"
9613,BOOK II.,"Sunk on the ground, and from his bosom drew"
9614,BOOK II.,"A desperate sigh, accusing Heaven and Fate,"
9615,BOOK II.,And angry Juno's unrelenting hate.
9616,BOOK II.,Cursed be the day when first I did appear;
9617,BOOK II.,"Let it be blotted from the calendar,                                90"
9618,BOOK II.,"Lest it pollute the month, and poison all the year!"
9619,BOOK II.,Still will the jealous queen pursue our race?
9620,BOOK II.,"Cadmus is dead, the Theban city was:"
9621,BOOK II.,Yet ceases not her hate: for all who come
9622,BOOK II.,From Cadmus are involved in Cadmus' doom.
9623,BOOK II.,I suffer for my blood: unjust decree!
9624,BOOK II.,That punishes another's crime on me.
9625,BOOK II.,"In mean estate I serve my mortal foe,"
9626,BOOK II.,The man who caused my country's overthrow.
9627,BOOK II.,"This is not all; for Juno, to my shame,                            100"
9628,BOOK II.,Has forced me to forsake my former name;
9629,BOOK II.,"Arcite I was, Philostratus I am."
9630,BOOK II.,That side of heaven is all my enemy:
9631,BOOK II.,Mars ruin'd Thebes: his mother ruin'd me.
9632,BOOK II.,Of all the royal race remains but one
9633,BOOK II.,"Besides myself, the unhappy Palamon,"
9634,BOOK II.,"Whom Theseus holds in bonds, and will not free;"
9635,BOOK II.,"Without a crime, except his kin to me."
9636,BOOK II.,"Yet these, and all the rest, I could endure;"
9637,BOOK II.,But love's a malady without a cure:                                110
9638,BOOK II.,Fierce love has pierced me with his fiery dart;
9639,BOOK II.,"He fires within, and hisses at my heart."
9640,BOOK II.,"Your eyes, fair Emily, my fate pursue;"
9641,BOOK II.,"I suffer for the rest, I die for you!"
9642,BOOK II.,"Of such a goddess no time leaves record,"
9643,BOOK II.,Who burn'd the temple where she was adored:
9644,BOOK II.,"And let it burn, I never will complain,"
9645,BOOK II.,"Pleased with my sufferings, if you knew my pain."
9646,BOOK II.,
9647,BOOK II.,"At this a sickly qualm his heart assail'd,"
9648,BOOK II.,"His ears ring inward, and his senses fail'd.                       120"
9649,BOOK II.,"No word miss'd Palamon of all he spoke,"
9650,BOOK II.,But soon to deadly pale he changed his look:
9651,BOOK II.,"He trembled every limb, and felt a smart,"
9652,BOOK II.,As if cold steel had glided through his heart;
9653,BOOK II.,"No longer staid, but starting from his place,"
9654,BOOK II.,"Discover'd stood, and show'd his hostile face:"
9655,BOOK II.,"False traitor, Arcite! traitor to thy blood!"
9656,BOOK II.,"Bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good,"
9657,BOOK II.,"Now art thou found forsworn, for Emily;"
9658,BOOK II.,"And darest attempt her love, for whom I die.                       130"
9659,BOOK II.,"So hast thou cheated Theseus with a wile,"
9660,BOOK II.,"Against thy vow, returning to beguile"
9661,BOOK II.,"Under a borrow'd name: as false to me,"
9662,BOOK II.,So false thou art to him who set thee free.
9663,BOOK II.,"But rest assured, that either thou shalt die,"
9664,BOOK II.,Or else renounce thy claim in Emily:
9665,BOOK II.,"For though unarm'd I am, and (freed by chance)"
9666,BOOK II.,"Am here without my sword, or pointed lance,"
9667,BOOK II.,"Hope not, base man, unquestioned hence to go,"
9668,BOOK II.,"For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.                                  140"
9669,BOOK II.,
9670,BOOK II.,"Arcite, who heard his tale, and knew the man,"
9671,BOOK II.,"His sword unsheath'd, and fiercely thus began:"
9672,BOOK II.,"Now by the gods who govern heaven above,"
9673,BOOK II.,"Wert thou not weak with hunger, mad with love,"
9674,BOOK II.,"That word had been thy last, or in this grove"
9675,BOOK II.,This hand should force thee to renounce thy love.
9676,BOOK II.,"The surety which I gave thee, I defy:"
9677,BOOK II.,"Fool, not to know that love endures no tie,"
9678,BOOK II.,And Jove but laughs at lovers' perjury.
9679,BOOK II.,Know I will serve the fair in thy despite;                         150
9680,BOOK II.,"But since thou art my kinsman, and a knight,"
9681,BOOK II.,"Here, have my faith, to-morrow in this grove"
9682,BOOK II.,Our arms shall plead the titles of our love:
9683,BOOK II.,"And Heaven so help my right, as I alone"
9684,BOOK II.,"Will come, and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown;"
9685,BOOK II.,With arms of proof both for myself and thee;
9686,BOOK II.,"Choose thou the best, and leave the worst to me."
9687,BOOK II.,"And, that at better ease thou may'st abide,"
9688,BOOK II.,"Bedding and clothes I will this night provide,"
9689,BOOK II.,"And needful sustenance, that thou may'st be                        160"
9690,BOOK II.,"A conquest better won, and worthy me."
9691,BOOK II.,His promise Palamon accepts; but pray'd
9692,BOOK II.,To keep it better than the first he made.
9693,BOOK II.,"Thus fair they parted till the morrow's dawn,"
9694,BOOK II.,For each had laid his plighted faith to pawn.
9695,BOOK II.,
9696,BOOK II.,"Oh, Love! thou sternly dost thy power maintain,"
9697,BOOK II.,And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign;
9698,BOOK II.,Tyrants and thou all fellowship disdain!
9699,BOOK II.,"This was in Arcite proved, and Palamon,"
9700,BOOK II.,"Both in despair, yet each would love alone.                        170"
9701,BOOK II.,"Arcite return'd, and, as in honour tied,"
9702,BOOK II.,"His foe with bedding, and with food supplied;"
9703,BOOK II.,"Then, ere the day, two suits of armour sought,"
9704,BOOK II.,"Which, borne before him on his steed, he brought:"
9705,BOOK II.,"Both were of shining steel, and wrought so pure,"
9706,BOOK II.,As might the strokes of two such arms endure.
9707,BOOK II.,"Now, at the time, and in the appointed place,"
9708,BOOK II.,"The challenger and challenged, face to face,"
9709,BOOK II.,"Approach; each other from afar they knew,"
9710,BOOK II.,And from afar their hatred changed their hue.                      180
9711,BOOK II.,"So stands the Thracian herdsman with his spear,"
9712,BOOK II.,"Pull in the gap, and hopes the hunted bear,"
9713,BOOK II.,"And hears him rustling in the wood, and sees"
9714,BOOK II.,His course at distance by the bending trees;
9715,BOOK II.,"And thinks, Here comes my mortal enemy,"
9716,BOOK II.,"And either he must fall in fight, or I:"
9717,BOOK II.,"This while he thinks, he lifts aloft his dart;"
9718,BOOK II.,A generous chilness seizes every part:
9719,BOOK II.,"The veins pour back the blood, and fortify the heart."
9720,BOOK II.,
9721,BOOK II.,Thus pale they meet; their eyes with fury burn;                  190
9722,BOOK II.,None greets; for none the greeting will return:
9723,BOOK II.,"But in dumb surliness, each arm'd with care"
9724,BOOK II.,"His foe profess'd, as brother of the war:"
9725,BOOK II.,"Then both, no moment lost, at once advance"
9726,BOOK II.,"Against each other, arm'd with sword and lance:"
9727,BOOK II.,"They lash, they foin, they pass, they strive to bore"
9728,BOOK II.,Their corslets and the thinnest parts explore.
9729,BOOK II.,"Thus two long hours in equal arms they stood,"
9730,BOOK II.,"And wounded, wound, till both were bathed in blood;"
9731,BOOK II.,"And not a foot of ground had either got,                           200"
9732,BOOK II.,As if the world depended on the spot.
9733,BOOK II.,"Fell Arcite like an angry tiger fared,"
9734,BOOK II.,And like a lion Palamon appear'd:
9735,BOOK II.,"Or, as two boars, whom love to battle draws,"
9736,BOOK II.,"With rising bristles, and with frothy jaws,"
9737,BOOK II.,Their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound;
9738,BOOK II.,With grunts and groans the forest rings around.
9739,BOOK II.,"So fought the knights, and fighting must abide,"
9740,BOOK II.,Till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide.
9741,BOOK II.,
9742,BOOK II.,"The power that ministers to God's decrees,                       210"
9743,BOOK II.,"And executes on earth what Heaven foresees,"
9744,BOOK II.,"Call'd providence, or chance, or fatal sway,"
9745,BOOK II.,"Comes with resistless force, and finds or makes her way."
9746,BOOK II.,"Nor kings, nor nations, nor united power,"
9747,BOOK II.,One moment can retard the appointed hour;
9748,BOOK II.,"And some one day, some wondrous chance appears,"
9749,BOOK II.,Which happen'd not in centuries of years:
9750,BOOK II.,"For sure, whate'er we mortals hate, or love,"
9751,BOOK II.,"Or hope, or fear, depends on Powers above;"
9752,BOOK II.,"They move our appetites to good or ill,                            220"
9753,BOOK II.,And by foresight necessitate the will.
9754,BOOK II.,In Theseus this appears; whose youthful joy
9755,BOOK II.,Was beasts of chase in forests to destroy:
9756,BOOK II.,"This gentle knight, inspired by jolly May,"
9757,BOOK II.,"Forsook his easy couch at early day,"
9758,BOOK II.,And to the wood and wilds pursued his way.
9759,BOOK II.,"Beside him rode Hippolita the queen,"
9760,BOOK II.,"And Emily attired in lively green,"
9761,BOOK II.,"With horns, and hounds, and all the tuneful cry,"
9762,BOOK II.,To hunt a royal hart within the covert nigh:                       230
9763,BOOK II.,"And as he follow'd Mars before, so now"
9764,BOOK II.,He serves the goddess of the silver bow.
9765,BOOK II.,The way that Theseus took was to the wood
9766,BOOK II.,Where the two knights in cruel battle stood:
9767,BOOK II.,"The lawn on which they fought, the appointed place"
9768,BOOK II.,In which the uncoupled hounds began the chase.
9769,BOOK II.,"Thither forth-right he rode to rouse the prey,"
9770,BOOK II.,"That, shaded by the fern, in harbour lay;"
9771,BOOK II.,"And thence dislodged, was wont to leave the wood"
9772,BOOK II.,"For open fields, and cross the crystal flood.                      240"
9773,BOOK II.,"Approach'd, and looking underneath the sun,"
9774,BOOK II.,"He saw proud Arcite, and fierce Palamon,"
9775,BOOK II.,"In mortal battle doubling blow on blow,"
9776,BOOK II.,"Like lightning flamed their falchions to and fro,"
9777,BOOK II.,"And shot a dreadful gleam; so strong they strook,"
9778,BOOK II.,There seem'd less force required to fell an oak:
9779,BOOK II.,"He gazed with wonder on their equal might,"
9780,BOOK II.,"Look'd eager on, but knew not either knight:"
9781,BOOK II.,"Resolved to learn, he spurr'd his fiery steed"
9782,BOOK II.,With goring rowels to provoke his speed.                           250
9783,BOOK II.,"The minute ended that began the race,"
9784,BOOK II.,So soon he was betwixt them on the place;
9785,BOOK II.,"And, with his sword unsheath'd, on pain of life"
9786,BOOK II.,Commands both combatants to cease their strife:
9787,BOOK II.,Then with imperious tone pursues his threat:
9788,BOOK II.,What are you? why in arms together met?
9789,BOOK II.,"How dares your pride presume against my laws,"
9790,BOOK II.,As in a listed field to fight your cause?
9791,BOOK II.,"Unask'd the royal grant; no marshal by,"
9792,BOOK II.,As knightly rites require; nor judge to try?                       260
9793,BOOK II.,"Then Palamon, with scarce recover'd breath,"
9794,BOOK II.,"Thus hasty spoke: We both deserve the death,"
9795,BOOK II.,"And both would die; for look the world around,"
9796,BOOK II.,A pair so wretched is not to be found;
9797,BOOK II.,"Our life's a load; encumber'd with the charge,"
9798,BOOK II.,We long to set the imprison'd soul at large.
9799,BOOK II.,"Now, as thou art a sovereign judge, decree"
9800,BOOK II.,The rightful doom of death to him and me;
9801,BOOK II.,"Let neither find thy grace, for grace is cruelty."
9802,BOOK II.,"Me first, oh, kill me first, and cure my woe;                      270"
9803,BOOK II.,Then sheath the sword of justice on my foe:
9804,BOOK II.,"Or kill him first; for when his name is heard,"
9805,BOOK II.,He foremost will receive his due reward.
9806,BOOK II.,Arcite of Thebes is he; thy mortal foe:
9807,BOOK II.,"On whom thy grace did liberty bestow,"
9808,BOOK II.,"But first contracted, that if ever found"
9809,BOOK II.,"By day or night upon the Athenian ground,"
9810,BOOK II.,His head should pay the forfeit; see return'd
9811,BOOK II.,"The perjured knight, his oath and honour scorn'd."
9812,BOOK II.,"For this is he, who, with a borrow'd name                          280"
9813,BOOK II.,"And proffer'd service, to thy palace came,"
9814,BOOK II.,"Now call'd Philostratus: retain'd by thee,"
9815,BOOK II.,"A traitor trusted, and in high degree,"
9816,BOOK II.,Aspiring to the bed of beauteous Emily.
9817,BOOK II.,"My part remains; from Thebes my birth I own,"
9818,BOOK II.,And call myself the unhappy Palamon.
9819,BOOK II.,Think me not like that man; since no disgrace
9820,BOOK II.,Can force me to renounce the honour of my race.
9821,BOOK II.,"Know me for what I am: I broke my chain,"
9822,BOOK II.,Nor promised I thy prisoner to remain:                             290
9823,BOOK II.,"The love of liberty with life is given,"
9824,BOOK II.,And life itself the inferior gift of Heaven.
9825,BOOK II.,"Thus without crime I fled; but further know,"
9826,BOOK II.,"I, with this Arcite, am thy mortal foe:"
9827,BOOK II.,"Then give me death, since I thy life pursue;"
9828,BOOK II.,"For safeguard of thyself, death is my due."
9829,BOOK II.,"More would'st thou know? I love bright Emily,"
9830,BOOK II.,"And, for her sake, and in her sight will die:"
9831,BOOK II.,But kill my rival too; for he no less
9832,BOOK II.,"Deserves; and I thy righteous doom will bless,                     300"
9833,BOOK II.,"Assured that what I lose, he never shall possess."
9834,BOOK II.,
9835,BOOK II.,"To this replied the stern Athenian prince,"
9836,BOOK II.,And sourly smiled: In owning your offence
9837,BOOK II.,You judge yourself; and I but keep record
9838,BOOK II.,"In place of law, while you pronounce the word."
9839,BOOK II.,"Take your desert, the death you have decreed;"
9840,BOOK II.,"I seal your doom, and ratify the deed:"
9841,BOOK II.,"By Mars, the patron of my arms, you die!"
9842,BOOK II.,
9843,BOOK II.,He said; dumb sorrow seized the standers-by.
9844,BOOK II.,"The queen above the rest, by nature good,                          310"
9845,BOOK II.,(The pattern form'd of perfect womanhood)
9846,BOOK II.,"For tender pity wept: when she began,"
9847,BOOK II.,Through the bright quire the infectious virtue ran.
9848,BOOK II.,"All dropt their tears, even the contended maid;"
9849,BOOK II.,And thus among themselves they softly said:
9850,BOOK II.,What eyes can suffer this unworthy sight!
9851,BOOK II.,"Two youths of royal blood, renown'd in fight,"
9852,BOOK II.,"The mastership of Heaven in face and mind,"
9853,BOOK II.,"And lovers, far beyond their faithless kind:"
9854,BOOK II.,See their wide streaming wounds; they neither came                 300
9855,BOOK II.,"For pride of empire, nor desire of fame:"
9856,BOOK II.,"Kings fight for kingdoms, madmen for applause;"
9857,BOOK II.,But love for love alone; that crowns the lover's cause.
9858,BOOK II.,"This thought, which ever bribes the beauteous kind,"
9859,BOOK II.,"Such pity wrought in every lady's mind,"
9860,BOOK II.,"They left their steeds, and, prostrate on the place,"
9861,BOOK II.,From the fierce king implored the offenders' grace.
9862,BOOK II.,
9863,BOOK II.,"He paused a while, stood silent in his mood"
9864,BOOK II.,(For yet his rage was boiling in his blood);
9865,BOOK II.,"But soon his tender mind the impression felt,                      330"
9866,BOOK II.,"(As softest metals are not slow to melt,"
9867,BOOK II.,And pity soonest runs in softest minds):
9868,BOOK II.,Then reasons with himself; and first he finds
9869,BOOK II.,"His passion cast a mist before his sense,"
9870,BOOK II.,"And either made, or magnified the offence."
9871,BOOK II.,Offence! of what? to whom? who judged the cause?
9872,BOOK II.,The prisoner freed himself by nature's laws:
9873,BOOK II.,"Born free, he sought his right: the man he freed"
9874,BOOK II.,"Was perjured, but his love excused the deed."
9875,BOOK II.,"Thus pondering, he look'd under with his eyes,                     340"
9876,BOOK II.,"And saw the women's tears, and heard their cries;"
9877,BOOK II.,"Which moved compassion more; he shook his head,"
9878,BOOK II.,"And, softly sighing, to himself he said:"
9879,BOOK II.,"Curse on the unpardoning prince, whom tears can draw"
9880,BOOK II.,To no remorse; who rules by lions' law;
9881,BOOK II.,"And deaf to prayers, by no submission bow'd,"
9882,BOOK II.,"Rends all alike; the penitent, and proud!"
9883,BOOK II.,"At this, with look serene, he raised his head;"
9884,BOOK II.,"Reason resumed her place, and passion fled:"
9885,BOOK II.,"Then thus aloud he spoke: The power of love,                       350"
9886,BOOK II.,"In earth, and seas, and air, and heaven above,"
9887,BOOK II.,"Rules, unresisted, with an awful nod;"
9888,BOOK II.,By daily miracles declared a god:
9889,BOOK II.,"He blinds the wise, gives eyesight to the blind;"
9890,BOOK II.,And moulds and stamps anew the lover's mind.
9891,BOOK II.,"Behold that Arcite, and this Palamon,"
9892,BOOK II.,"Freed from my fetters, and in safety gone,"
9893,BOOK II.,What hinder'd either in their native soil
9894,BOOK II.,At ease to reap the harvest of their toil?
9895,BOOK II.,"But Love, their lord, did otherwise ordain,                        360"
9896,BOOK II.,"And brought them in their own despite again,"
9897,BOOK II.,"To suffer death deserved; for well they know,"
9898,BOOK II.,"'Tis in my power, and I their deadly foe."
9899,BOOK II.,"The proverb holds, that to be wise and love,"
9900,BOOK II.,Is hardly granted to the gods above.
9901,BOOK II.,See how the madmen bleed! behold the gains
9902,BOOK II.,"With which their master, Love, rewards their pains!"
9903,BOOK II.,"For seven long years, on duty every day,"
9904,BOOK II.,"Lo, their obedience, and their monarch's pay:"
9905,BOOK II.,"Yet, as in duty bound, they serve him on;                          370"
9906,BOOK II.,"And, ask the fools, they think it wisely done;"
9907,BOOK II.,"Nor ease, nor wealth, nor life itself regard,"
9908,BOOK II.,"For 'tis their maxim, Love is love's reward."
9909,BOOK II.,"This is not all; the fair, for whom they strove,"
9910,BOOK II.,"Nor knew before, nor could suspect their love;"
9911,BOOK II.,"Nor thought, when she beheld the sight from far,"
9912,BOOK II.,Her beauty was the occasion of the war.
9913,BOOK II.,"But sure a general doom on man is past,"
9914,BOOK II.,"And all are fools and lovers, first or last:"
9915,BOOK II.,"This both by others and myself I know,                             380"
9916,BOOK II.,For I have served their sovereign long ago;
9917,BOOK II.,Oft have been caught within the winding train
9918,BOOK II.,"Of female snares, and felt the lover's pain,"
9919,BOOK II.,And learn'd how far the god can human hearts constrain.
9920,BOOK II.,"To this remembrance, and the prayers of those"
9921,BOOK II.,"Who for the offending warriors interpose,"
9922,BOOK II.,"I give their forfeit lives; on this accord,"
9923,BOOK II.,To do me homage as their sovereign lord;
9924,BOOK II.,"And, as my vassals, to their utmost might,"
9925,BOOK II.,"Assist my person, and assert my right.                             390"
9926,BOOK II.,
9927,BOOK II.,"This freely sworn, the knights their grace obtain'd;"
9928,BOOK II.,Then thus the king his secret thoughts explain'd:
9929,BOOK II.,"If wealth, or honour, or a royal race,"
9930,BOOK II.,"Or each, or all, may win a lady's grace,"
9931,BOOK II.,Then either of you knights may well deserve
9932,BOOK II.,A princess born; and such is she you serve:
9933,BOOK II.,"For Emily is sister to the crown,"
9934,BOOK II.,And but too well to both her beauty known:
9935,BOOK II.,"But should you combat till you both were dead,"
9936,BOOK II.,Two lovers cannot share a single bed:                              400
9937,BOOK II.,"As, therefore, both are equal in degree,"
9938,BOOK II.,The lot of both be left to destiny.
9939,BOOK II.,"Now hear the award, and happy may it prove"
9940,BOOK II.,"To her, and him who best deserves her love."
9941,BOOK II.,"Depart from hence in peace, and, free as air,"
9942,BOOK II.,"Search the wide world, and where you please repair;"
9943,BOOK II.,But on the day when this returning sun
9944,BOOK II.,"To the same point through every sign has run,"
9945,BOOK II.,"Then each of you his hundred knights shall bring,"
9946,BOOK II.,"In royal lists, to fight before the king;                          410"
9947,BOOK II.,"And then the knight, whom fate or happy chance"
9948,BOOK II.,"Shall with his friends to victory advance,"
9949,BOOK II.,"And grace his arms so far in equal fight,"
9950,BOOK II.,"From out the bars to force his opposite,"
9951,BOOK II.,"Or kill, or make him recreant on the plain,"
9952,BOOK II.,The prize of valour and of love shall gain;
9953,BOOK II.,"The vanquish'd party shall their claim release,"
9954,BOOK II.,And the long jars conclude in lasting peace.
9955,BOOK II.,"The charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground,"
9956,BOOK II.,"The theatre of war, for champions so renown'd;                     420"
9957,BOOK II.,"And take the patron's place of either knight,"
9958,BOOK II.,With eyes impartial to behold the fight;
9959,BOOK II.,And Heaven of me so judge as I shall judge aright.
9960,BOOK II.,"If both are satisfied with this accord,"
9961,BOOK II.,Swear by the laws of knighthood on my sword.
9962,BOOK II.,
9963,BOOK II.,Who now but Palamon exults with joy?
9964,BOOK II.,And ravish'd Arcite seems to touch the sky:
9965,BOOK II.,"The whole assembled troop was pleased as well,"
9966,BOOK II.,"Extol the award, and on their knees they fell"
9967,BOOK II.,"To bless the gracious king. The knights, with leave,               430"
9968,BOOK II.,"Departing from the place, his last commands receive;"
9969,BOOK II.,"On Emily with equal ardour look,"
9970,BOOK II.,And from her eyes their inspiration took.
9971,BOOK II.,"From thence to Thebes' old walls pursue their way,"
9972,BOOK II.,Each to provide his champions for the day.
9973,BOOK II.,
9974,BOOK II.,"It might be deem'd, on our historian's part,"
9975,BOOK II.,"Or too much negligence, or want of art,"
9976,BOOK II.,If he forgot the vast magnificence
9977,BOOK II.,"Of royal Theseus, and his large expense,"
9978,BOOK II.,"He first enclosed for lists a level ground,                        440"
9979,BOOK II.,The whole circumference a mile around;
9980,BOOK II.,The form was circular; and all without
9981,BOOK II.,"A trench was sunk, to moat the place about."
9982,BOOK II.,"Within an amphitheatre appear'd,"
9983,BOOK II.,Raised in degrees; to sixty paces rear'd:
9984,BOOK II.,"That when a man was placed in one degree,"
9985,BOOK II.,Height was allow'd for him above to see.
9986,BOOK II.,
9987,BOOK II.,Eastward was built a gate of marble white;
9988,BOOK II.,The like adorn'd the western opposite.
9989,BOOK II.,"A nobler object than this fabric was,                              450"
9990,BOOK II.,Rome never saw; nor of so vast a space.
9991,BOOK II.,"For rich with spoils of many a conquer'd land,"
9992,BOOK II.,All arts and artists Theseus could command;
9993,BOOK II.,"Who sold for hire, or wrought for better fame;"
9994,BOOK II.,"The master-painters, and the carvers came."
9995,BOOK II.,So rose within the compass of the year
9996,BOOK II.,"An age's work, a glorious theatre."
9997,BOOK II.,Then o'er its eastern gate was raised above
9998,BOOK II.,"A temple, sacred to the Queen of Love;"
9999,BOOK II.,An altar stood below: on either hand                               460
10000,BOOK II.,"A priest with roses crown'd, who held a myrtle wand."
10001,BOOK II.,
10002,BOOK II.,"The dome of Mars was on the gate opposed,"
10003,BOOK II.,"And on the north a turret was enclosed,"
10004,BOOK II.,"Within the wall, of alabaster white,"
10005,BOOK II.,"And crimson coral, for the Queen of Night,"
10006,BOOK II.,Who takes in sylvan sports her chaste delight.
10007,BOOK II.,
10008,BOOK II.,Within these oratories might you see
10009,BOOK II.,"Rich carvings, portraitures, and imagery:"
10010,BOOK II.,Where every figure to the life express'd
10011,BOOK II.,The godhead's power to whom it was address'd.                      470
10012,BOOK II.,In Venus' temple on the sides were seen
10013,BOOK II.,The broken slumbers of enamour'd men;
10014,BOOK II.,"Prayers that even spoke, and pity seem'd to call,"
10015,BOOK II.,And issuing sighs that smoked along the wall;
10016,BOOK II.,"Complaints, and hot desires, the lover's hell,"
10017,BOOK II.,And scalding tears that wore a channel where they fell:
10018,BOOK II.,"And all around were nuptial bonds, the ties,"
10019,BOOK II.,"Of love's assurance, and a train of lies,"
10020,BOOK II.,"That, made in lust, conclude in perjuries."
10021,BOOK II.,"Beauty, and Youth, and Wealth, and Luxury,                         480"
10022,BOOK II.,"And spritely Hope, and short-enduring Joy;"
10023,BOOK II.,"And Sorceries to raise the infernal powers,"
10024,BOOK II.,And Sigils framed in planetary hours:
10025,BOOK II.,"Expense, and After-Thought, and idle Care,"
10026,BOOK II.,"And Doubts of motley hue, and dark Despair;"
10027,BOOK II.,"Suspicious, and fantastical Surmise,"
10028,BOOK II.,"And Jealousy suffused, with jaundice in her eyes,"
10029,BOOK II.,"Discolouring all she view'd, in tawny dress'd,"
10030,BOOK II.,"Down-look'd, and with a cuckoo on her fist."
10031,BOOK II.,"Opposed to her, on the other side advance                          490"
10032,BOOK II.,"The costly feast, the carol, and the dance,"
10033,BOOK II.,"Minstrels and Music, Poetry and Play,"
10034,BOOK II.,"And balls by night, and tournaments by day."
10035,BOOK II.,"All these were painted on the wall, and more;"
10036,BOOK II.,With acts and monuments of times before:
10037,BOOK II.,"And others added by prophetic doom,"
10038,BOOK II.,"And lovers yet unborn, and loves to come:"
10039,BOOK II.,"For there the Idalian mount, and Citheron,"
10040,BOOK II.,"The court of Venus, was in colours drawn:"
10041,BOOK II.,"Before the palace-gate, in careless dress,                         500"
10042,BOOK II.,"And loose array, sat portress Idleness:"
10043,BOOK II.,"There, by the fount, Narcissus pined alone;"
10044,BOOK II.,"There Samson was; with wiser Solomon,"
10045,BOOK II.,And all the mighty names by love undone.
10046,BOOK II.,"Medea's charms were there, Circean feasts,"
10047,BOOK II.,With bowls that turn'd enamour'd youths to beasts:
10048,BOOK II.,"Here might be seen, that beauty, wealth, and wit,"
10049,BOOK II.,"And prowess, to the power of love submit:"
10050,BOOK II.,The spreading snare for all mankind is laid;
10051,BOOK II.,"And lovers all betray, and are betray'd.                           510"
10052,BOOK II.,The goddess self some noble hand had wrought;
10053,BOOK II.,"Smiling she seem'd, and full of pleasing thought:"
10054,BOOK II.,"From ocean as she first began to rise,"
10055,BOOK II.,And smooth'd the ruffled seas and clear'd the skies;
10056,BOOK II.,"She trode the brine, all bare below the breast,"
10057,BOOK II.,And the green waves but ill conceal'd the rest;
10058,BOOK II.,A lute she held; and on her head was seen
10059,BOOK II.,"A wreath of roses red, and myrtles green;"
10060,BOOK II.,Her turtles fann'd the buxom air above;
10061,BOOK II.,"And, by his mother, stood an infant Love,                          520"
10062,BOOK II.,With wings unfledged; his eyes were banded o'er;
10063,BOOK II.,"His hands a bow, his back a quiver bore,"
10064,BOOK II.,"Supplied with arrows bright and keen, a deadly store."
10065,BOOK II.,
10066,BOOK II.,But in the dome of mighty Mars the red
10067,BOOK II.,With different figures all the sides were spread;
10068,BOOK II.,"This temple, less in form, with equal grace,"
10069,BOOK II.,Was imitative of the first in Thrace:
10070,BOOK II.,For that cold region was the loved abode
10071,BOOK II.,And sovereign mansion of the warrior god.
10072,BOOK II.,The landscape was a forest wide and bare;                          530
10073,BOOK II.,"Where neither beast, nor human kind repair;"
10074,BOOK II.,"The fowl, that scent afar, the borders fly,"
10075,BOOK II.,"And shun the bitter blast, and wheel about the sky."
10076,BOOK II.,"A cake of scurf lies baking on the ground,"
10077,BOOK II.,"And prickly stubs, instead of trees, are found;"
10078,BOOK II.,"Or woods, with knots and knares, deform'd and old;"
10079,BOOK II.,"Headless the most, and hideous to behold:"
10080,BOOK II.,"A rattling tempest through the branches went,"
10081,BOOK II.,"That stripp'd them bare, and one sole way they bent."
10082,BOOK II.,"Heaven froze above, severe, the clouds congeal,                    540"
10083,BOOK II.,And through the crystal vault appear'd the standing hail.
10084,BOOK II.,Such was the face without; a mountain stood
10085,BOOK II.,"Threatening from high, and overlook'd the wood:"
10086,BOOK II.,"Beneath the lowering brow, and on a bent,"
10087,BOOK II.,The temple stood of Mars armipotent:
10088,BOOK II.,"The frame of burnish'd steel, that cast a glare"
10089,BOOK II.,"From far, and seem'd to thaw the freezing air."
10090,BOOK II.,"A strait long entry to the temple led,"
10091,BOOK II.,Blind with high walls; and horror over head:
10092,BOOK II.,"Thence issued such a blast, and hollow roar,                       550"
10093,BOOK II.,As threaten'd from the hinge to heave the door:
10094,BOOK II.,"In through that door, a northern light there shone;"
10095,BOOK II.,"'Twas all it had, for windows there were none."
10096,BOOK II.,The gate was adamant; eternal frame!
10097,BOOK II.,"Which, hew'd by Mars himself, from Indian quarries came,"
10098,BOOK II.,The labour of a god; and all along
10099,BOOK II.,Tough iron plates were clench'd to make it strong.
10100,BOOK II.,A tun about was every pillar there;
10101,BOOK II.,A polish'd mirror shone not half so clear.
10102,BOOK II.,"There saw I how the secret felon wrought,                          560"
10103,BOOK II.,And treason labouring in the traitor's thought;
10104,BOOK II.,And midwife Time the ripen'd plot to murder brought.
10105,BOOK II.,There the red Anger dared the pallid Fear;
10106,BOOK II.,"Next stood Hypocrisy, with holy leer,"
10107,BOOK II.,"Soft smiling, and demurely looking down,"
10108,BOOK II.,But hid the dagger underneath the gown:
10109,BOOK II.,"The assassinating wife, the household fiend;"
10110,BOOK II.,"And far the blackest there, the traitor-friend."
10111,BOOK II.,"On the other side, there stood Destruction bare;"
10112,BOOK II.,"Unpunish'd Rapine, and a waste of War.                             570"
10113,BOOK II.,"Contest, with sharpen'd knives, in cloisters drawn,"
10114,BOOK II.,And all with blood bespread the holy lawn.
10115,BOOK II.,"Loud menaces were heard, and foul disgrace,"
10116,BOOK II.,"And bawling infamy, in language base;"
10117,BOOK II.,"Till sense was lost in sound, and silence fled the place."
10118,BOOK II.,"The slayer of himself yet saw I there,"
10119,BOOK II.,The gore congeal'd was clotted in his hair;
10120,BOOK II.,"With eyes half closed, and gaping mouth he lay,"
10121,BOOK II.,"And grim, as when he breathed his sullen soul away."
10122,BOOK II.,"In midst of all the dome, Misfortune sate,                         580"
10123,BOOK II.,"And gloomy Discontent, and fell Debate,"
10124,BOOK II.,And Madness laughing in his ireful mood;
10125,BOOK II.,And arm'd complaint on theft; and cries of blood.
10126,BOOK II.,"There was the murder'd corpse in covert laid,"
10127,BOOK II.,And violent death in thousand shapes display'd:
10128,BOOK II.,The city to the soldiers rage resigned:
10129,BOOK II.,"Successless wars, and poverty behind:"
10130,BOOK II.,"Ships burnt in fight, or forced on rocky shores,"
10131,BOOK II.,And the rash hunter strangled by the boars:
10132,BOOK II.,The new-born babe by nurses overlaid;                              590
10133,BOOK II.,And the cook caught within the raging fire he made.
10134,BOOK II.,"All ills of Mars his nature, flame and steel;"
10135,BOOK II.,"The gasping charioteer, beneath the wheel"
10136,BOOK II.,Of his own car; the ruin'd house that falls
10137,BOOK II.,And intercepts her lord betwixt the walls:
10138,BOOK II.,"The whole division that to Mars pertains,"
10139,BOOK II.,"All trades of death that deal in steel for gains,"
10140,BOOK II.,"Were there: the butcher, armourer, and smith,"
10141,BOOK II.,"Whose forges sharpen'd falchions, or the scythe."
10142,BOOK II.,"The scarlet conquest on a tower was placed,                        600"
10143,BOOK II.,"With shouts, and soldiers' acclamations graced:"
10144,BOOK II.,"A pointed sword hung threatening o'er his head,"
10145,BOOK II.,Sustain'd but by a slender twine of thread.
10146,BOOK II.,"There saw I Mars his ides, the Capitol,"
10147,BOOK II.,The seer in vain foretelling CÃ¦sar's fall;
10148,BOOK II.,"The last triumvirs, and the wars they move,"
10149,BOOK II.,"And Antony, who lost the world for love."
10150,BOOK II.,"These, and a thousand more, the fane adorn;"
10151,BOOK II.,"Their fates were painted ere the men were born,"
10152,BOOK II.,"All copied from the heavens, and ruling force                      610"
10153,BOOK II.,"Of the red star, in his revolving course."
10154,BOOK II.,"The form of Mars high on a chariot stood,"
10155,BOOK II.,"All sheath'd in arms, and gruffly look'd the god:"
10156,BOOK II.,Two geomantic figures were display'd
10157,BOOK II.,"Above his head, a warrior and a maid,"
10158,BOOK II.,"One when direct, and one when retrograde."
10159,BOOK II.,
10160,BOOK II.,"Tired with deformities of death, I haste"
10161,BOOK II.,To the third temple of Diana chaste.
10162,BOOK II.,"A sylvan scene with various greens was drawn,"
10163,BOOK II.,"Shades on the sides, and in the midst a lawn:                      620"
10164,BOOK II.,"The silver Cynthia, with her nymphs around,"
10165,BOOK II.,"Pursued the flying deer, the woods with horns resound:"
10166,BOOK II.,"Calisto there stood manifest of shame,"
10167,BOOK II.,"And, turn'd a bear, the northern star became:"
10168,BOOK II.,"Her son was next, and, by peculiar grace,"
10169,BOOK II.,In the cold circle held the second place:
10170,BOOK II.,The stag Acteon in the stream had spied
10171,BOOK II.,"The naked huntress, and, for seeing, died:"
10172,BOOK II.,"His hounds, unknowing of his change pursue"
10173,BOOK II.,"The chase, and their mistaken master slew.                         630"
10174,BOOK II.,"Peneian Daphne too was there to see,"
10175,BOOK II.,"Apollo's love before, and now his tree:"
10176,BOOK II.,"The adjoining fane the assembled Greeks express'd,"
10177,BOOK II.,And hunting of the Caledonian beast.
10178,BOOK II.,"Oenides' valour, and his envied prize;"
10179,BOOK II.,The fatal power of Atalanta's eyes;
10180,BOOK II.,"Diana's vengeance on the victor shown,"
10181,BOOK II.,The murderess mother; and consuming son;
10182,BOOK II.,The Volscian queen extended on the plain;
10183,BOOK II.,"The treason punish'd, and the traitor slain.                       640"
10184,BOOK II.,"The rest were various huntings, well design'd,"
10185,BOOK II.,"And savage beasts destroy'd, of every kind."
10186,BOOK II.,The graceful goddess was array'd in green;
10187,BOOK II.,"About her feet were little beagles seen,"
10188,BOOK II.,That watch'd with upward eyes the motions of their queen.
10189,BOOK II.,"Her legs were buskin'd, and the left before,"
10190,BOOK II.,"In act to shoot; a silver bow she bore,"
10191,BOOK II.,And at her back a painted quiver wore.
10192,BOOK II.,"She trod a waxing moon, that soon would wane,"
10193,BOOK II.,"And, drinking borrow'd light, be fill'd again:                     650"
10194,BOOK II.,"With downcast eyes, as seeming to survey"
10195,BOOK II.,"The dark dominions, her alternate sway."
10196,BOOK II.,"Before her stood a women in her throes,"
10197,BOOK II.,"And call'd Lucina's aid, her burden to disclose."
10198,BOOK II.,"All these the painter drew with such command,"
10199,BOOK II.,"That Nature snatch'd the pencil from his hand,"
10200,BOOK II.,Ashamed and angry that his art could feign
10201,BOOK II.,And mend the tortures of a mother's pain.
10202,BOOK II.,"Theseus beheld the fanes of every god,"
10203,BOOK II.,And thought his mighty cost was well bestow'd.                     660
10204,BOOK II.,So princes now their poets should regard;
10205,BOOK II.,"But few can write, and fewer can reward."
10206,BOOK II.,
10207,BOOK II.,"The theatre thus raised, the lists enclosed,"
10208,BOOK II.,"And all with vast magnificence disposed,"
10209,BOOK II.,"We leave the monarch pleased, and haste to bring"
10210,BOOK II.,"The knights to combat, and their arms to sing."
10211,BOOK II.,
10212,BOOK II.,
10213,BOOK III.,BOOK III.
10214,BOOK III.,
10215,BOOK III.,
10216,BOOK III.,The day approach'd when Fortune should decide
10217,BOOK III.,"The important enterprise, and give the bride;"
10218,BOOK III.,"For now, the rivals round the world had sought,"
10219,BOOK III.,"And each his number, well appointed, brought."
10220,BOOK III.,"The nations, far and near, contend in choice,"
10221,BOOK III.,And send the flower of war by public voice;
10222,BOOK III.,"That after, or before, were never known"
10223,BOOK III.,"Such chiefs, as each an army seem'd alone:"
10224,BOOK III.,"Beside the champions, all of high degree,"
10225,BOOK III.,"Who knighthood loved, and deeds of chivalry,                        10"
10226,BOOK III.,"Throng'd to the lists, and envied to behold"
10227,BOOK III.,"The names of others, not their own, enroll'd."
10228,BOOK III.,Nor seems it strange; for every noble knight
10229,BOOK III.,"Who loves the fair, and is endued with might,"
10230,BOOK III.,In such a quarrel would be proud to fight.
10231,BOOK III.,There breathes not scarce a man on British ground
10232,BOOK III.,(An isle for love and arms of old renown'd)
10233,BOOK III.,"But would have sold his life to purchase fame,"
10234,BOOK III.,To Palamon or Arcite sent his name:
10235,BOOK III.,"And had the land selected of the best,                              20"
10236,BOOK III.,"Half had come hence, and let the world provide the rest."
10237,BOOK III.,"A hundred knights with Palamon there came,"
10238,BOOK III.,"Approved in fight, and men of mighty name;"
10239,BOOK III.,"Their arms were several, as their nations were,"
10240,BOOK III.,But furnish'd all alike with sword and spear.
10241,BOOK III.,"Some wore coat-armour, imitating scale;"
10242,BOOK III.,And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail.
10243,BOOK III.,"Some wore a breastplate and a light jupon,"
10244,BOOK III.,Their horses clothed with rich caparison:
10245,BOOK III.,"Some for defence would leathern bucklers use,                       30"
10246,BOOK III.,Of folded hides; and others shields of pruce.
10247,BOOK III.,"One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow,"
10248,BOOK III.,And one a heavy mace to stun the foe;
10249,BOOK III.,"One for his legs and knees provided well,"
10250,BOOK III.,"With jambeaux arm'd, and double plates of steel:"
10251,BOOK III.,"This on his helmet wore a lady's glove,"
10252,BOOK III.,And that a sleeve embroider'd by his love.
10253,BOOK III.,
10254,BOOK III.,"With Palamon above the rest in place,"
10255,BOOK III.,"Lycurgus came, the surly king of Thrace;"
10256,BOOK III.,"Black was his beard, and manly was his face;                        40"
10257,BOOK III.,"The balls of his broad eyes roll'd in his head,"
10258,BOOK III.,And glared betwixt a yellow and a red:
10259,BOOK III.,"He look'd a lion with a gloomy stare,"
10260,BOOK III.,And o'er his eyebrows hung his matted hair:
10261,BOOK III.,"Big-boned, and large of limbs, with sinews strong,"
10262,BOOK III.,"Broad-shoulder'd, and his arms were round and long."
10263,BOOK III.,Four milk-white bulls (the Thracian use of old)
10264,BOOK III.,Were yoked to draw his car of burnish'd gold.
10265,BOOK III.,"Upright he stood, and bore aloft his shield,"
10266,BOOK III.,"Conspicuous from afar, and overlook'd the field.                    50"
10267,BOOK III.,His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back;
10268,BOOK III.,"His hair hung long behind, and glossy raven black."
10269,BOOK III.,"His ample forehead bore a coronet,"
10270,BOOK III.,With sparkling diamonds and with rubies set:
10271,BOOK III.,"Ten brace, and more, of greyhounds, snowy fair,"
10272,BOOK III.,"And tall as stags, ran loose, and coursed around his chair,"
10273,BOOK III.,"A match for pards in flight, in grappling for the bear:"
10274,BOOK III.,"With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound,"
10275,BOOK III.,And collars of the same their necks surround.
10276,BOOK III.,Thus through the fields Lycurgus took his way;                      60
10277,BOOK III.,His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array.
10278,BOOK III.,
10279,BOOK III.,"To match this monarch, with strong Arcite came"
10280,BOOK III.,"Emetrius, king of Ind, a mighty name;"
10281,BOOK III.,"On a bay courser, goodly to behold,"
10282,BOOK III.,The trappings of his horse adorn'd with barbarous gold.
10283,BOOK III.,Not Mars bestrod a steed with greater grace;
10284,BOOK III.,"His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace,"
10285,BOOK III.,"Adorn'd with pearls, all orient, round, and great;"
10286,BOOK III.,"His saddle was of gold, with emeralds set,"
10287,BOOK III.,"His shoulders large a mantle did attire,                            70"
10288,BOOK III.,"With rubies thick, and sparkling as the fire:"
10289,BOOK III.,"His amber-colour'd locks in ringlets run,"
10290,BOOK III.,"With graceful negligence, and shone against the sun."
10291,BOOK III.,"His nose was aquiline, his eyes were blue;"
10292,BOOK III.,"Ruddy his lips, and fresh and fair his hue:"
10293,BOOK III.,"Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen,"
10294,BOOK III.,Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skill:
10295,BOOK III.,"His awful presence did the crowd surprise,"
10296,BOOK III.,Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes;
10297,BOOK III.,"Eyes that confess'd him born for kingly sway,                       80"
10298,BOOK III.,"So fierce, they flash'd intolerable day."
10299,BOOK III.,"His age in nature's youthful prime appear'd,"
10300,BOOK III.,And just began to bloom his yellow beard.
10301,BOOK III.,"Whene'er he spoke, his voice was heard around,"
10302,BOOK III.,"Loud as a trumpet, with a silver sound;"
10303,BOOK III.,"A laurel wreathed his temples, fresh and green;"
10304,BOOK III.,"And myrtle sprigs, the marks of love, were mix'd between."
10305,BOOK III.,"Upon his fist he bore, for his delight,"
10306,BOOK III.,"An eagle well reclaim'd, and lily white."
10307,BOOK III.,
10308,BOOK III.,"His hundred knights attend him to the war,                        90"
10309,BOOK III.,All arm'd for battle; save their heads were bare.
10310,BOOK III.,"Words and devices blazed on every shield,"
10311,BOOK III.,And pleasing was the terror of the field.
10312,BOOK III.,"For kings, and dukes, and barons, you might see,"
10313,BOOK III.,"Like sparkling stars, though different in degree,"
10314,BOOK III.,"All for the increase of arms, and love of chivalry."
10315,BOOK III.,"Before the king tame leopards led the way,"
10316,BOOK III.,And troops of lions innocently play.
10317,BOOK III.,"So Bacchus through the conquer'd Indies rode,"
10318,BOOK III.,And beasts in gambols frisk'd before their honest god.             100
10319,BOOK III.,
10320,BOOK III.,"In this array, the war of either side"
10321,BOOK III.,Through Athens pass'd with military pride.
10322,BOOK III.,"At prime, they enter'd on the Sunday morn;"
10323,BOOK III.,"Rich tapestry spread the streets, and flowers the posts adorn."
10324,BOOK III.,The town was all a jubilee of feasts;
10325,BOOK III.,"So Theseus will'd, in honour of his guests;"
10326,BOOK III.,"Himself with open arms the kings embraced,"
10327,BOOK III.,Then all the rest in their degrees were graced.
10328,BOOK III.,"No harbinger was needful for the night,"
10329,BOOK III.,For every house was proud to lodge a knight.                       110
10330,BOOK III.,
10331,BOOK III.,"I pass the royal treat, nor must relate"
10332,BOOK III.,"The gifts bestow'd, nor how the champions sate:"
10333,BOOK III.,"Who first, who last, or how the knights address'd"
10334,BOOK III.,"Their vows, or who was fairest at the feast;"
10335,BOOK III.,"Whose voice, whose graceful dance did most surprise;"
10336,BOOK III.,"Soft amorous sighs, and silent love of eyes."
10337,BOOK III.,"The rivals call my Muse another way,"
10338,BOOK III.,To sing their vigils for the ensuing day.
10339,BOOK III.,
10340,BOOK III.,"'Twas ebbing darkness, past the noon of night:"
10341,BOOK III.,"And Phosphor, on the confines of the light,                        120"
10342,BOOK III.,"Promised the sun; ere day began to spring,"
10343,BOOK III.,"The tuneful lark already stretch'd her wing,"
10344,BOOK III.,"And flickering on her nest, made short essays to sing."
10345,BOOK III.,"When wakeful Palamon, preventing day,"
10346,BOOK III.,"Took to the royal lists his early way,"
10347,BOOK III.,"To Venus at her fane, in her own house, to pray."
10348,BOOK III.,"There, falling on his knees before her shrine,"
10349,BOOK III.,He thus implored with prayers her power divine:
10350,BOOK III.,
10351,BOOK III.,"Creator Venus, genial power of love,"
10352,BOOK III.,"The bliss of men below, and gods above!                            130"
10353,BOOK III.,"Beneath the sliding sun thou runn'st thy race,"
10354,BOOK III.,"Dost fairest shine, and best become thy place."
10355,BOOK III.,"For thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear,"
10356,BOOK III.,"Thy month reveals the spring, and opens all the year."
10357,BOOK III.,"Thee, goddess! thee the storms of winter fly,"
10358,BOOK III.,"Earth smiles with flowers renewing, laughs the sky,"
10359,BOOK III.,And birds to lays of love their tuneful notes apply.
10360,BOOK III.,"For thee the lion loathes the taste of blood,"
10361,BOOK III.,"And, roaring, hunts his female through the wood:"
10362,BOOK III.,"For thee the bulls rebellow through the groves,                    140"
10363,BOOK III.,"And tempt the stream, and snuff their absent loves."
10364,BOOK III.,"'Tis thine, whate'er is pleasant, good, or fair:"
10365,BOOK III.,"All nature is thy province, life thy care:"
10366,BOOK III.,"Thou madest the world, and dost the world repair."
10367,BOOK III.,"Thou gladder of the mount of Cytheron,"
10368,BOOK III.,"Increase of Jove, companion of the sun!"
10369,BOOK III.,"If e'er Adonis touch'd thy tender heart,"
10370,BOOK III.,"Have pity, goddess, for thou know'st the smart!"
10371,BOOK III.,Alas! I have not words to tell my grief;
10372,BOOK III.,To vent my sorrow would be some relief;                            150
10373,BOOK III.,Light sufferings give us leisure to complain;
10374,BOOK III.,"We groan, but cannot speak, in greater pain."
10375,BOOK III.,"O goddess! tell thyself what I would say,"
10376,BOOK III.,"Thou know'st it, and I feel too much to pray."
10377,BOOK III.,"So grant my suit, as I enforce my might,"
10378,BOOK III.,"In love to be thy champion, and thy knight;"
10379,BOOK III.,"A servant to thy sex, a slave to thee,"
10380,BOOK III.,A foe profess'd to barren chastity.
10381,BOOK III.,"Nor ask I fame or honour of the field,"
10382,BOOK III.,Nor choose I more to vanquish than to yield:                       160
10383,BOOK III.,In my divine Emilia make me blest;
10384,BOOK III.,"Let Fate, or partial Chance, dispose the rest:"
10385,BOOK III.,"Find thou the manner, and the means prepare;"
10386,BOOK III.,"Possession, more than conquest, is my care."
10387,BOOK III.,"Mars is the warrior's god; in him it lies,"
10388,BOOK III.,On whom he favours to confer the prize;
10389,BOOK III.,With smiling aspect you serenely move
10390,BOOK III.,"In your fifth orb, and rule the realm of love."
10391,BOOK III.,"The Fates but only spin the coarser clue,"
10392,BOOK III.,The finest of the wool is left for you;                            170
10393,BOOK III.,"Spare me but one small portion of the twine,"
10394,BOOK III.,And let the sisters cut below your line:
10395,BOOK III.,"The rest among the rubbish may they sweep,"
10396,BOOK III.,Or add it to the yarn of some old miser's heap.
10397,BOOK III.,"But, if you this ambitious prayer deny,"
10398,BOOK III.,"(A wish, I grant, beyond mortality,)"
10399,BOOK III.,"Then let me sink beneath proud Arcite's arms,"
10400,BOOK III.,"And I once dead, let him possess her charms."
10401,BOOK III.,
10402,BOOK III.,Thus ended he; then with observance due
10403,BOOK III.,The sacred incense on her altar threw:                             180
10404,BOOK III.,The curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires;
10405,BOOK III.,"At length it catches flame, and in a blaze expires;"
10406,BOOK III.,"At once the gracious goddess gave the sign,"
10407,BOOK III.,"Her statue shook, and trembled all the shrine:"
10408,BOOK III.,Pleased Palamon the tardy omen took:
10409,BOOK III.,"For, since the flames pursued the trailing smoke,"
10410,BOOK III.,He knew his boon was granted; but the day
10411,BOOK III.,"To distance driven, and joy adjourn'd with long delay."
10412,BOOK III.,
10413,BOOK III.,"Now morn with rosy light had streak'd the sky,"
10414,BOOK III.,"Up rose the sun, and up rose Emily;                                190"
10415,BOOK III.,"Address'd her early steps to Cynthia's fane,"
10416,BOOK III.,"In state attended by her maiden train,"
10417,BOOK III.,"Who bore the vests that holy rites require,"
10418,BOOK III.,"Incense, and odorous gums, and cover'd fire."
10419,BOOK III.,"The plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown,"
10420,BOOK III.,Nor wanted aught besides in honour of the Moon.
10421,BOOK III.,"Now while the temple smoked with hallow'd steam,"
10422,BOOK III.,They wash the virgin in a living stream;
10423,BOOK III.,"The secret ceremonies I conceal,"
10424,BOOK III.,"Uncouth, perhaps unlawful, to reveal:                              200"
10425,BOOK III.,"But such they were as Pagan use required,"
10426,BOOK III.,"Perform'd by women when the men retired,"
10427,BOOK III.,Whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites
10428,BOOK III.,"Might turn to scandal, or obscene delights."
10429,BOOK III.,"Well-meaners think no harm; but for the rest,"
10430,BOOK III.,"Things sacred they pervert, and silence is the best."
10431,BOOK III.,"Her shining hair, uncomb'd, was loosely spread,"
10432,BOOK III.,A crown of mastless oak adorn'd her head:
10433,BOOK III.,"When to the shrine approach'd, the spotless maid"
10434,BOOK III.,Had kindling fires on either altar laid:                           210
10435,BOOK III.,"(The rites were such as were observed of old,"
10436,BOOK III.,By Statius in his Theban story told.)
10437,BOOK III.,"Then kneeling with her hands across her breast,"
10438,BOOK III.,Thus lowly she preferr'd her chaste request:
10439,BOOK III.,"Oh, goddess, haunter of the woodland green,"
10440,BOOK III.,To whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen;
10441,BOOK III.,"Queen of the nether skies, where half the year"
10442,BOOK III.,"Thy silver beams descend, and light the gloomy sphere!"
10443,BOOK III.,"Goddess of maids, and conscious of our hearts,"
10444,BOOK III.,"So keep me from the vengeance of thy darts,                        220"
10445,BOOK III.,"Which Niobe's devoted issue felt,"
10446,BOOK III.,When hissing through the skies the feather'd deaths were dealt;
10447,BOOK III.,"As I desire to live a virgin life,"
10448,BOOK III.,Nor know the name of mother or of wife.
10449,BOOK III.,"Thy votress from my tender years I am,"
10450,BOOK III.,"And love, like thee, the woods and sylvan game."
10451,BOOK III.,"Like death, thou know'st, I loathe the nuptial state,"
10452,BOOK III.,"And man, the tyrant of our sex, I hate,"
10453,BOOK III.,"A lowly servant, but a lofty mate:"
10454,BOOK III.,Where love is duty on the female side;                             230
10455,BOOK III.,"On theirs, mere sensual gust, and sought with surly pride."
10456,BOOK III.,"Now by thy triple shape, as thou art seen"
10457,BOOK III.,"In heaven, earth, hell, and everywhere a queen,"
10458,BOOK III.,"Grant this my first desire; let discord cease,"
10459,BOOK III.,And make betwixt the rivals lasting peace:
10460,BOOK III.,"Quench their hot fire, or far from me remove"
10461,BOOK III.,"The flame, and turn it on some other love;"
10462,BOOK III.,"Or, if my frowning stars have so decreed,"
10463,BOOK III.,"That one must be rejected, one succeed,"
10464,BOOK III.,"Make him my lord, within whose faithful breast                     240"
10465,BOOK III.,"Is fix'd my image, and who loves me best."
10466,BOOK III.,"But, oh! even that avert! I choose it not,"
10467,BOOK III.,But take it as the least unhappy lot.
10468,BOOK III.,"A maid I am, and of thy virgin train;"
10469,BOOK III.,"Oh, let me still that spotless name retain!"
10470,BOOK III.,"Frequent the forests, thy chaste will obey,"
10471,BOOK III.,And only make the beasts of chase my prey!
10472,BOOK III.,
10473,BOOK III.,"The flames ascend on either altar clear,"
10474,BOOK III.,While thus the blameless maid address'd her prayer.
10475,BOOK III.,"When, lo! the burning fire that shone so bright,                   250"
10476,BOOK III.,"Flew off all sudden, with extinguish'd light,"
10477,BOOK III.,"And left one altar dark, a little space;"
10478,BOOK III.,"Which turn'd self-kindled, and renew'd the blaze:"
10479,BOOK III.,"The other victor-flame a moment stood,"
10480,BOOK III.,"Then fell, and lifeless left the extinguish'd wood;"
10481,BOOK III.,"For ever lost, the irrevocable light"
10482,BOOK III.,"Forsook the blackening coals, and sunk to night:"
10483,BOOK III.,"At either end it whistled as it flew,"
10484,BOOK III.,"And as the brands were green, so dropp'd the dew;"
10485,BOOK III.,Infected as it fell with sweat of sanguine hue.                    260
10486,BOOK III.,
10487,BOOK III.,"The maid from that ill omen turn'd her eyes,"
10488,BOOK III.,"And with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies,"
10489,BOOK III.,"Nor knew what signified the boding sign,"
10490,BOOK III.,"But found the Powers displeased, and fear'd the wrath divine."
10491,BOOK III.,
10492,BOOK III.,"Then shook the sacred shrine, and sudden light"
10493,BOOK III.,"Sprung through the vaulted roof, and made the temple bright."
10494,BOOK III.,
10495,BOOK III.,"The Power, behold! the Power in glory shone,"
10496,BOOK III.,"By her bent bow, and her keen arrows known;"
10497,BOOK III.,"The rest, a huntress issuing from the wood,"
10498,BOOK III.,Reclining on her cornel spear she stood.                           270
10499,BOOK III.,"Then gracious thus began: Dismiss thy fear,"
10500,BOOK III.,And Heaven's unchanged decrees attentive hear:
10501,BOOK III.,"More powerful gods have torn thee from my side,"
10502,BOOK III.,"Unwilling to resign, and doom'd a bride:"
10503,BOOK III.,The two contending knights are weigh'd above;
10504,BOOK III.,"One Mars protects, and one the Queen of Love:"
10505,BOOK III.,"But which the man, is in the Thunderer's breast;"
10506,BOOK III.,"This he pronounced, 'Tis he who loves thee best."
10507,BOOK III.,"The fire that, once extinct, revived again,"
10508,BOOK III.,Foreshows the love allotted to remain:                             280
10509,BOOK III.,"Farewell! she said, and vanish'd from the place;"
10510,BOOK III.,"The sheaf of arrows shook, and rattled in the case."
10511,BOOK III.,"Aghast at this, the royal virgin stood,"
10512,BOOK III.,"Disclaim'd, and now no more a sister of the wood:"
10513,BOOK III.,But to the parting goddess thus she pray'd:
10514,BOOK III.,"Propitious still be present to my aid,"
10515,BOOK III.,Nor quite abandon your once favour'd maid.
10516,BOOK III.,"Then sighing she return'd; but smiled betwixt,"
10517,BOOK III.,"With hopes and fears, and joys with sorrows mix'd."
10518,BOOK III.,
10519,BOOK III.,The next returning planetary hour                                290
10520,BOOK III.,"Of Mars, who shared the heptarchy of power,"
10521,BOOK III.,"His steps bold Arcite to the temple bent,"
10522,BOOK III.,To adore with Pagan rites the power armipotent:
10523,BOOK III.,"Then prostrate, low before his altar lay,"
10524,BOOK III.,"And raised his manly voice, and thus began to pray:"
10525,BOOK III.,
10526,BOOK III.,"Strong God of arms, whose iron sceptre sways"
10527,BOOK III.,"The freezing North, and Hyperborean seas,"
10528,BOOK III.,"And Scythian colds, and Thracia's wintry coast,"
10529,BOOK III.,"Where stand thy steeds, and thou art honour'd most!"
10530,BOOK III.,"There most; but everywhere thy power is known,                     300"
10531,BOOK III.,The fortune of the fight is all thy own:
10532,BOOK III.,"Terror is thine, and wild amazement, flung"
10533,BOOK III.,"From out thy chariot, withers even the strong:"
10534,BOOK III.,"And disarray and shameful rout ensue,"
10535,BOOK III.,And force is added to the fainting crew.
10536,BOOK III.,"Acknowledged as thou art, accept my prayer,"
10537,BOOK III.,If aught I have achieved deserve thy care:
10538,BOOK III.,"If to my utmost power, with sword and shield,"
10539,BOOK III.,"I dared the death, unknowing how to yield,"
10540,BOOK III.,"And falling in my rank, still kept the field:                      310"
10541,BOOK III.,"Then let my arms prevail, by thee sustain'd,"
10542,BOOK III.,That Emily by conquest may be gain'd.
10543,BOOK III.,Have pity on my pains; nor those unknown
10544,BOOK III.,"To Mars, which, when a lover, were his own."
10545,BOOK III.,"Venus, the public care of all above,"
10546,BOOK III.,Thy stubborn heart has soften'd into love:
10547,BOOK III.,"Now, by her blandishments and powerful charms,"
10548,BOOK III.,"When yielded she lay curling in thy arms,"
10549,BOOK III.,"Even by thy shame, if shame it may be call'd,"
10550,BOOK III.,When Vulcan had thee in his net enthrall'd;                        320
10551,BOOK III.,"(Oh, envied ignominy, sweet disgrace,"
10552,BOOK III.,When every god that saw thee wish'd thy place!)
10553,BOOK III.,"By those dear pleasures, aid my arms in fight,"
10554,BOOK III.,And make me conquer in my patron's right:
10555,BOOK III.,"For I am young, a novice in the trade,"
10556,BOOK III.,"The fool of love, unpractised to persuade:"
10557,BOOK III.,"And want the soothing arts that catch the fair,"
10558,BOOK III.,"But, caught myself, lie struggling in the snare:"
10559,BOOK III.,"And she I love, or laughs at all my pain,"
10560,BOOK III.,Or knows her worth too well; and pays me with disdain.             330
10561,BOOK III.,"For sure I am, unless I win in arms,"
10562,BOOK III.,To stand excluded from Emilia's charms:
10563,BOOK III.,"Nor can my strength avail, unless by thee"
10564,BOOK III.,"Endued with force, I gain the victory!"
10565,BOOK III.,"Then for the fire which warm'd thy generous heart,"
10566,BOOK III.,"Pity thy subject's pains, and equal smart."
10567,BOOK III.,"So be the morrow's sweat and labour mine,"
10568,BOOK III.,The palm and honour of the conquest thine:
10569,BOOK III.,"Then shall the war, and stern debate, and strife"
10570,BOOK III.,"Immortal, be the business of my life;                              340"
10571,BOOK III.,"And in thy fane, the dusty spoils among,"
10572,BOOK III.,"High on the burnish'd roof, my banner shall be hung:"
10573,BOOK III.,"Rank'd with my champions' bucklers, and below,"
10574,BOOK III.,"With arms reversed, the achievements of my foe:"
10575,BOOK III.,"And while these limbs the vital spirit feeds,"
10576,BOOK III.,"While day to night, and night to day succeeds,"
10577,BOOK III.,Thy smoking altar shall be fat with food
10578,BOOK III.,"Of incense, and the grateful steam of blood;"
10579,BOOK III.,Burnt-offerings morn and evening shall be thine;
10580,BOOK III.,And fires eternal in thy temple shine.                             350
10581,BOOK III.,"The bush of yellow beard, this length of hair,"
10582,BOOK III.,"Which from my birth inviolate I bear,"
10583,BOOK III.,"Guiltless of steel, and from the razor free,"
10584,BOOK III.,"Shall fall a plenteous crop, reserved for thee."
10585,BOOK III.,"So may my arms with victory be blest,"
10586,BOOK III.,I ask no more; let Fate dispose the rest.
10587,BOOK III.,
10588,BOOK III.,The champion ceased; there follow'd in the close
10589,BOOK III.,A hollow groan: a murmuring wind arose;
10590,BOOK III.,"The rings of iron, that on the doors were hung,"
10591,BOOK III.,"Sent out a jarring sound, and harshly rung:                        360"
10592,BOOK III.,"The bolted gates flew open at the blast,"
10593,BOOK III.,"The storm rush'd in, and Arcite stood aghast:"
10594,BOOK III.,"The flames were blown aside, yet shone they bright,"
10595,BOOK III.,"Fann'd by the wind, and gave a ruffled light."
10596,BOOK III.,"Then from the ground a scent began to rise,"
10597,BOOK III.,"Sweet smelling, as accepted sacrifice:"
10598,BOOK III.,"This omen pleased, and as the flames aspire"
10599,BOOK III.,With odorous incense Arcite heaps the fire:
10600,BOOK III.,"Nor wanted hymns to Mars, or heathen charms:"
10601,BOOK III.,"At length the nodding statue clash'd his arms,                     370"
10602,BOOK III.,"And with a sullen sound and feeble cry,"
10603,BOOK III.,"Half sunk, and half pronounced the word of victory."
10604,BOOK III.,"For this, with soul devout, he thank'd the god,"
10605,BOOK III.,"And, of success secure, return'd to his abode."
10606,BOOK III.,
10607,BOOK III.,"These vows thus granted, raised a strife above,"
10608,BOOK III.,Betwixt the God of War and Queen of Love.
10609,BOOK III.,"She, granting first, had right of time to plead;"
10610,BOOK III.,"But he had granted too, nor would recede."
10611,BOOK III.,"Jove was for Venus; but he fear'd his wife,"
10612,BOOK III.,And seem'd unwilling to decide the strife;                         380
10613,BOOK III.,"Till Saturn from his leaden throne arose,"
10614,BOOK III.,And found a way the difference to compose:
10615,BOOK III.,"Though sparing of his grace, to mischief bent,"
10616,BOOK III.,He seldom does a good with good intent.
10617,BOOK III.,"Wayward, but wise; by long experience taught,"
10618,BOOK III.,"To please both parties, for ill ends, he sought:"
10619,BOOK III.,"For this advantage age from youth has won,"
10620,BOOK III.,"As not to be outridden, though outrun."
10621,BOOK III.,"By fortune he was now to Venus trined,"
10622,BOOK III.,And with stern Mars in Capricorn was join'd:                       390
10623,BOOK III.,"Of him disposing in his own abode,"
10624,BOOK III.,"He soothed the goddess, while he gull'd the god:"
10625,BOOK III.,"Cease, daughter, to complain, and stint the strife;"
10626,BOOK III.,Thy Palamon shall have his promised wife:
10627,BOOK III.,"And Mars, the lord of conquest, in the fight"
10628,BOOK III.,With palm and laurel shall adorn his knight.
10629,BOOK III.,"Wide is my course, nor turn I to my place,"
10630,BOOK III.,"Till length of time, and move with tardy pace."
10631,BOOK III.,"Man feels me, when I press the ethereal plains,"
10632,BOOK III.,"My hand is heavy, and the wound remains.                           400"
10633,BOOK III.,"Mine is the shipwreck, in a watery sign;"
10634,BOOK III.,"And in an earthy, the dark dungeon mine."
10635,BOOK III.,"Cold shivering agues, melancholy care,"
10636,BOOK III.,"And bitter blasting winds, and poison'd air,"
10637,BOOK III.,"Are mine, and wilful death, resulting from despair."
10638,BOOK III.,"The throttling quinsey 'tis my star appoints,"
10639,BOOK III.,And rheumatisms ascend to rack the joints:
10640,BOOK III.,"When churls rebel against their native prince,"
10641,BOOK III.,"I arm their hands, and furnish the pretence;"
10642,BOOK III.,"And housing in the lion's hateful sign,                            410"
10643,BOOK III.,"Bought senates, and deserting troops are mine."
10644,BOOK III.,Mine is the privy poisoning; I command
10645,BOOK III.,"Unkindly seasons, and ungrateful land."
10646,BOOK III.,By me kings' palaces are push'd to ground.
10647,BOOK III.,And miners crush'd beneath their mines are found.
10648,BOOK III.,"'Twas I slew Samson, when the pillar'd hall"
10649,BOOK III.,"Fell down, and crush'd the many with the fall."
10650,BOOK III.,"My looking is the sire of pestilence,"
10651,BOOK III.,That sweeps at once the people and the prince.
10652,BOOK III.,"Now weep no more, but trust thy grandsire's art,                   420"
10653,BOOK III.,"Mars shall be pleased, and thou perform thy part."
10654,BOOK III.,"'Tis ill, though different your complexions are,"
10655,BOOK III.,The family of heaven for men should war.
10656,BOOK III.,"The expedient pleased, where neither lost his right;"
10657,BOOK III.,"Mars had the day, and Venus had the night."
10658,BOOK III.,The management they left to Chronos' care;
10659,BOOK III.,"Now turn we to the effect, and sing the war."
10660,BOOK III.,
10661,BOOK III.,"In Athens all was pleasure, mirth, and play,"
10662,BOOK III.,"All proper to the spring, and spritely May:"
10663,BOOK III.,"Which every soul inspired with such delight,                       430"
10664,BOOK III.,"'Twas jesting all the day, and love at night."
10665,BOOK III.,"Heaven smiled, and gladded was the heart of man;"
10666,BOOK III.,And Venus had the world as when it first began.
10667,BOOK III.,"At length in sleep their bodies they compose,"
10668,BOOK III.,"And dreamt the future fight, and early rose."
10669,BOOK III.,
10670,BOOK III.,"Now scarce the dawning day began to spring,"
10671,BOOK III.,"As at a signal given, the streets with clamours ring:"
10672,BOOK III.,"At once the crowd arose; confused and high,"
10673,BOOK III.,"Even from the heaven, was heard a shouting cry;"
10674,BOOK III.,"For Mars was early up, and roused the sky.                         440"
10675,BOOK III.,"The gods came downward to behold the wars,"
10676,BOOK III.,"Sharpening their sights, and leaning from their stars."
10677,BOOK III.,"The neighing of the generous horse was heard,"
10678,BOOK III.,For battle by the busy groom prepared:
10679,BOOK III.,"Rustling of harness, rattling of the shield,"
10680,BOOK III.,"Clattering of armour, furbish'd for the field."
10681,BOOK III.,"Crowds to the castle mounted up the street,"
10682,BOOK III.,Battering the pavement with their coursers' feet:
10683,BOOK III.,The greedy sight might there devour the gold
10684,BOOK III.,"Of glittering arms, too dazzling to behold:                        450"
10685,BOOK III.,"And polish'd steel, that cast the view aside,"
10686,BOOK III.,"And crested morions, with their plumy pride."
10687,BOOK III.,"Knights, with a long retinue of their squires,"
10688,BOOK III.,"In gaudy liveries march, and quaint attires."
10689,BOOK III.,"One laced the helm, another held the lance:"
10690,BOOK III.,A third the shining buckler did advance.
10691,BOOK III.,"The courser paw'd the ground with restless feet,"
10692,BOOK III.,"And snorting foam'd, and champ'd the golden bit."
10693,BOOK III.,"The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride,"
10694,BOOK III.,"Files in their hands, and hammers at their side,                   460"
10695,BOOK III.,"And nails for loosen'd spears, and thongs for shields provide."
10696,BOOK III.,"The yeomen guard the streets, in seemly bands;"
10697,BOOK III.,"And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands."
10698,BOOK III.,
10699,BOOK III.,"The trumpets, next the gate, in order placed,"
10700,BOOK III.,Attend the sign to sound the martial blast;
10701,BOOK III.,"The palace-yard is fill'd with floating tides,"
10702,BOOK III.,And the last comers bear the former to the sides.
10703,BOOK III.,The throng is in the midst: the common crew
10704,BOOK III.,"Shut out, the hall admits the better few;"
10705,BOOK III.,"In knots they stand, or in a rank they walk,                       470"
10706,BOOK III.,"Serious in aspect, earnest in their talk;"
10707,BOOK III.,"Factious, and favouring this or the other side,"
10708,BOOK III.,As their strong fancy or weak reason guide:
10709,BOOK III.,Their wagers back their wishes; numbers hold
10710,BOOK III.,"With the fair freckled king, and beard of gold:"
10711,BOOK III.,"So vigorous are his eyes, such rays they cast,"
10712,BOOK III.,So prominent his eagle's beak is placed.
10713,BOOK III.,"But most their looks on the black monarch bend,"
10714,BOOK III.,"His rising muscles, and his brawn commend;"
10715,BOOK III.,"His double-biting axe, and beamy spear,                            480"
10716,BOOK III.,Each asking a gigantic force to rear.
10717,BOOK III.,All spoke as partial favour moved the mind;
10718,BOOK III.,"And, safe themselves, at others' cost divined."
10719,BOOK III.,
10720,BOOK III.,"Waked by the cries, the Athenian chief arose,"
10721,BOOK III.,The knightly forms of combat to dispose;
10722,BOOK III.,"And passing through the obsequious guards, he sate"
10723,BOOK III.,"Conspicuous on a throne, sublime in state;"
10724,BOOK III.,"There, for the two contending knights he sent;"
10725,BOOK III.,"Arm'd cap-a-pie, with reverence low they bent;"
10726,BOOK III.,"He smiled on both, and with superior look                          490"
10727,BOOK III.,Alike their offer'd adoration took.
10728,BOOK III.,The people press on every side to see
10729,BOOK III.,"Their awful prince, and hear his high decree."
10730,BOOK III.,"Then signing to their heralds with his hand,"
10731,BOOK III.,They gave his orders from their lofty stand.
10732,BOOK III.,Silence is thrice enjoin'd; then thus aloud
10733,BOOK III.,The king-at-arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd:
10734,BOOK III.,
10735,BOOK III.,Our sovereign lord has ponder'd in his mind
10736,BOOK III.,The means to spare the blood of gentle kind;
10737,BOOK III.,"And of his grace, and inborn clemency,                             500"
10738,BOOK III.,He modifies his first severe decree!
10739,BOOK III.,"The keener edge of battle to rebate,"
10740,BOOK III.,"The troops for honour fighting, not for hate:"
10741,BOOK III.,"He wills, not death should terminate their strife,"
10742,BOOK III.,"And wounds, if wounds ensue, be short of life:"
10743,BOOK III.,"But issues, ere the fight, his dread command,"
10744,BOOK III.,"That slings afar, and poniards hand to hand,"
10745,BOOK III.,Be banish'd from the field; that none shall dare
10746,BOOK III.,With shorten'd sword to stab in closer war;
10747,BOOK III.,"But in fair combat fight with manly strength,                      510"
10748,BOOK III.,"Nor push with biting point, but strike at length;"
10749,BOOK III.,"The tourney is allow'd but one career,"
10750,BOOK III.,"Of the tough ash, with the sharp-grinded spear;"
10751,BOOK III.,"But knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain,"
10752,BOOK III.,And fight on foot their honour to regain;
10753,BOOK III.,"Nor, if at mischief taken, on the ground"
10754,BOOK III.,"Be slain, but prisoners to the pillar bound,"
10755,BOOK III.,"At either barrier placed; nor (captives made),"
10756,BOOK III.,"Be freed, or arm'd anew the fight invade."
10757,BOOK III.,"The chief of either side, bereft of life,                          520"
10758,BOOK III.,"Or yielded to his foe, concludes the strife."
10759,BOOK III.,"Thus dooms the lord: now, valiant knights and young,"
10760,BOOK III.,Fight each his fill with swords and maces long.
10761,BOOK III.,
10762,BOOK III.,The herald ends: the vaulted firmament
10763,BOOK III.,With loud acclaims and vast applause is rent:
10764,BOOK III.,"Heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good,"
10765,BOOK III.,"So just, and yet so provident of blood!"
10766,BOOK III.,"This was the general cry. The trumpets sound,"
10767,BOOK III.,And warlike symphony is heard around.
10768,BOOK III.,"The marching troops through Athens take their way,                 530"
10769,BOOK III.,The great earl-marshal orders their array.
10770,BOOK III.,The fair from high the passing pomp behold;
10771,BOOK III.,A rain of flowers is from the windows roll'd.
10772,BOOK III.,"The casements are with golden tissue spread,"
10773,BOOK III.,"And horses' hoofs, for earth, on silken tapestry tread."
10774,BOOK III.,"The king goes midmost, and the rivals ride"
10775,BOOK III.,"In equal rank, and close his either side."
10776,BOOK III.,"Next after these, there rode the royal wife,"
10777,BOOK III.,"With Emily, the cause, and the reward of strife."
10778,BOOK III.,"The following cavalcade, by three and three,                       540"
10779,BOOK III.,Proceed by titles marshall'd in degree.
10780,BOOK III.,"Thus through the southern gate they take their way,"
10781,BOOK III.,And at the list arrived ere prime of day.
10782,BOOK III.,"There, parting from the king, the chiefs divide,"
10783,BOOK III.,"And wheeling east and west, before their many ride."
10784,BOOK III.,"The Athenian monarch mounts his throne on high,"
10785,BOOK III.,And after him the queen and Emily:
10786,BOOK III.,"Next these, the kindred of the crown are graced"
10787,BOOK III.,"With nearer seats, and lords by ladies placed."
10788,BOOK III.,"Scarce were they seated, when with clamours loud                   550"
10789,BOOK III.,In rush'd at once a rude promiscuous crowd;
10790,BOOK III.,"The guards, and then each other overbear,"
10791,BOOK III.,And in a moment throng the spacious theatre.
10792,BOOK III.,"Now changed the jarring noise to whispers low,"
10793,BOOK III.,As winds forsaking seas more softly blow;
10794,BOOK III.,"When at the western gate, on which the car"
10795,BOOK III.,"Is placed aloft, that bears the god of war,"
10796,BOOK III.,"Proud Arcite entering arm'd before his train,"
10797,BOOK III.,"Stops at the barrier, and divides the plain."
10798,BOOK III.,"Red was his banner, and display'd abroad                           560"
10799,BOOK III.,The bloody colours of his patron god.
10800,BOOK III.,
10801,BOOK III.,At that self moment enters Palamon
10802,BOOK III.,"The gate of Venus, and the rising Sun;"
10803,BOOK III.,"Waved by the wanton winds, his banner flies,"
10804,BOOK III.,"All maiden white, and shares the people's eyes."
10805,BOOK III.,"From east to west, look all the world around,"
10806,BOOK III.,Two troops so match'd were never to be found;
10807,BOOK III.,"Such bodies built for strength, of equal age,"
10808,BOOK III.,In stature sized; so proud in equipage:
10809,BOOK III.,"The nicest eye could no distinction make,                          570"
10810,BOOK III.,"Where lay the advantage, or what side to take."
10811,BOOK III.,
10812,BOOK III.,"Thus ranged, the herald for the last proclaims"
10813,BOOK III.,"A silence, while they answer'd to their names:"
10814,BOOK III.,"For so the king decreed, to shun the care,"
10815,BOOK III.,"The fraud of musters false, the common bane of war."
10816,BOOK III.,"The tale was just, and then the gates were closed;"
10817,BOOK III.,"And chief to chief, and troop to troop opposed."
10818,BOOK III.,"The heralds last retired, and loudly cried--"
10819,BOOK III.,The fortune of the field be fairly tried!
10820,BOOK III.,
10821,BOOK III.,"At this, the challenger with fierce defy                         580"
10822,BOOK III.,His trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply;
10823,BOOK III.,"With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky."
10824,BOOK III.,"Their vizors closed, their lances in the rest,"
10825,BOOK III.,"Or at the helmet pointed, or the crest,"
10826,BOOK III.,"They vanish from the barrier, speed the race,"
10827,BOOK III.,And spurring see decrease the middle space.
10828,BOOK III.,"A cloud of smoke envelops either host,"
10829,BOOK III.,And all at once the combatants are lost:
10830,BOOK III.,"Darkling they join adverse, and shock unseen,"
10831,BOOK III.,"Coursers with coursers jostling, men with men:                     590"
10832,BOOK III.,"As labouring in eclipse, a while they stay,"
10833,BOOK III.,Till the next blast of wind restores the day.
10834,BOOK III.,They look anew: the beauteous form of fight
10835,BOOK III.,"Is changed, and war appears a grisly sight."
10836,BOOK III.,"Two troops in fair array one moment show'd,"
10837,BOOK III.,"The next, a field with fallen bodies strow'd:"
10838,BOOK III.,Not half the number in their seats are found;
10839,BOOK III.,But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground.
10840,BOOK III.,"The points of spears are stuck within the shield,"
10841,BOOK III.,The steeds without their riders scour the field.                   600
10842,BOOK III.,"The knights, unhorsed, on foot renew the fight;"
10843,BOOK III.,The glittering falchions cast a gleaming light:
10844,BOOK III.,"Hauberks and helms are hew'd with many a wound,"
10845,BOOK III.,Out spins the streaming blood and dyes the ground.
10846,BOOK III.,"The mighty maces with such haste descend,"
10847,BOOK III.,"They break the bones, and make the solid armour bend."
10848,BOOK III.,This thrusts amid the throng with furious force;
10849,BOOK III.,"Down goes, at once, the horseman and the horse:"
10850,BOOK III.,"That courser stumbles on the fallen steed,"
10851,BOOK III.,And floundering throws the rider o'er his head.                    610
10852,BOOK III.,"One rolls along, a foot-ball to his foes;"
10853,BOOK III.,One with a broken truncheon deals his blows.
10854,BOOK III.,"This halting, this disabled with his wound,"
10855,BOOK III.,"In triumph led, is to the pillar bound,"
10856,BOOK III.,Where by the king's award he must abide:
10857,BOOK III.,There goes a captive led on the other side.
10858,BOOK III.,"By fits they cease; and leaning on the lance,"
10859,BOOK III.,"Take breath a while, and to new fight advance."
10860,BOOK III.,
10861,BOOK III.,"Full oft the rivals met, and neither spared"
10862,BOOK III.,"His utmost force, and each forgot to ward.                         620"
10863,BOOK III.,"The head of this was to the saddle bent,"
10864,BOOK III.,The other backward to the crupper sent:
10865,BOOK III.,Both were by turns unhorsed; the jealous blows
10866,BOOK III.,"Fall thick and heavy, when on foot they close."
10867,BOOK III.,"So deep their falchions bite, that every stroke"
10868,BOOK III.,Pierced to the quick; and equal wounds they gave and took.
10869,BOOK III.,"Borne far asunder by the tides of men,"
10870,BOOK III.,Like adamant and steel they meet again.
10871,BOOK III.,
10872,BOOK III.,"So when a tiger sucks the bullock's blood,"
10873,BOOK III.,A famish'd lion issuing from the wood                              630
10874,BOOK III.,"Roars lordly fierce, and challenges the food:"
10875,BOOK III.,"Each claims possession, neither will obey,"
10876,BOOK III.,But both their paws are fasten'd on the prey;
10877,BOOK III.,"They bite, they tear; and while in vain they strive,"
10878,BOOK III.,"The swains come arm'd between, and both to distance drive."
10879,BOOK III.,
10880,BOOK III.,"At length, as Fate foredoom'd, and all things tend"
10881,BOOK III.,By course of time to their appointed end;
10882,BOOK III.,"So when the sun to west was far declined,"
10883,BOOK III.,"And both afresh in mortal battle join'd,"
10884,BOOK III.,"The strong Emetrius came in Arcite's aid,                          640"
10885,BOOK III.,And Palamon with odds was overlaid:
10886,BOOK III.,"For turning short, he struck with all his might"
10887,BOOK III.,Full on the helmet of the unwary knight.
10888,BOOK III.,"Deep was the wound; he stagger'd with the blow,"
10889,BOOK III.,And turn'd him to his unexpected foe;
10890,BOOK III.,"Whom with such force he struck, he fell'd him down,"
10891,BOOK III.,And cleft the circle of his golden crown.
10892,BOOK III.,"But Arcite's men, who now prevail'd in fight,"
10893,BOOK III.,Twice ten at once surround the single knight:
10894,BOOK III.,"O'erpower'd, at length, they force him to the ground,              650"
10895,BOOK III.,"Unyielded as he was, and to the pillar bound;"
10896,BOOK III.,"And King Lycurgus, while he fought in vain"
10897,BOOK III.,"His friend to free, was tumbled on the plain."
10898,BOOK III.,
10899,BOOK III.,"Who now laments but Palamon, compell'd"
10900,BOOK III.,No more to try the fortune of the field!
10901,BOOK III.,"And, worse than death, to view with hateful eyes"
10902,BOOK III.,"His rival's conquest, and renounce the prize!"
10903,BOOK III.,
10904,BOOK III.,"The royal judge, on his tribunal placed,"
10905,BOOK III.,"Who had beheld the fight from first to last,"
10906,BOOK III.,"Bade cease the war; pronouncing from on high,                      660"
10907,BOOK III.,Arcite of Thebes had won the beauteous Emily.
10908,BOOK III.,"The sound of trumpets to the voice replied,"
10909,BOOK III.,"And round the royal lists the heralds cried,"
10910,BOOK III.,Arcite of Thebes has won the beauteous bride!
10911,BOOK III.,
10912,BOOK III.,The people rend the skies with vast applause;
10913,BOOK III.,"All own the chief, when Fortune owns the cause."
10914,BOOK III.,"Arcite is own'd even by the gods above,"
10915,BOOK III.,And conquering Mars insults the Queen of Love.
10916,BOOK III.,"So laugh'd he, when the rightful Titan fail'd,"
10917,BOOK III.,And Jove's usurping arms in heaven prevail'd.                      670
10918,BOOK III.,Laugh'd all the powers who favour tyranny;
10919,BOOK III.,And all the standing army of the sky.
10920,BOOK III.,"But Venus with dejected eyes appears,"
10921,BOOK III.,"And, weeping on the lists, distill'd her tears;"
10922,BOOK III.,"Her will refused, which grieves a woman most,"
10923,BOOK III.,"And, in her champion foil'd, the cause of Love is lost."
10924,BOOK III.,"Till Saturn said, Fair daughter, now be still,"
10925,BOOK III.,The blustering fool has satisfied his will;
10926,BOOK III.,"His boon is given; his knight has gain'd the day,"
10927,BOOK III.,But lost the prize; the arrears are yet to pay;                    680
10928,BOOK III.,"Thy hour is come, and mine the care shall be"
10929,BOOK III.,"To please thy knight, and set thy promise free."
10930,BOOK III.,
10931,BOOK III.,"Now while the heralds run the lists around,"
10932,BOOK III.,And Arcite! Arcite! heaven and earth resound;
10933,BOOK III.,A miracle (nor less it could be call'd)
10934,BOOK III.,Their joy with unexpected sorrow pall'd.
10935,BOOK III.,"The victor knight had laid his helm aside,"
10936,BOOK III.,"Part for his ease, the greater part for pride;"
10937,BOOK III.,"Bare-headed, popularly low he bow'd,"
10938,BOOK III.,And paid the salutations of the crowd.                             690
10939,BOOK III.,"Then spurring at full speed, ran endlong on"
10940,BOOK III.,Where Theseus sate on his imperial throne;
10941,BOOK III.,"Furious he drove, and upward cast his eye,"
10942,BOOK III.,"Where, next the queen, was placed his Emily;"
10943,BOOK III.,"Then passing, to the saddle-bow he bent:"
10944,BOOK III.,A sweet regard the gracious virgin lent;
10945,BOOK III.,"(For women, to the brave an easy prey,"
10946,BOOK III.,Still follow Fortune where she leads the way):
10947,BOOK III.,"Just then, from earth sprung out a flashing fire,"
10948,BOOK III.,"By Pluto sent, at Saturn's bad desire:                             700"
10949,BOOK III.,"The startling steed was seized with sudden fright,"
10950,BOOK III.,"And, bounding, o'er the pommel cast the knight:"
10951,BOOK III.,"Forward he flew, and pitching on his head,"
10952,BOOK III.,"He quiver'd with his feet, and lay for dead."
10953,BOOK III.,"Black was his countenance in a little space,"
10954,BOOK III.,For all the blood was gather'd in his face.
10955,BOOK III.,"Help was at hand: they rear'd him from the ground,"
10956,BOOK III.,And from his cumbrous arms his limbs unbound;
10957,BOOK III.,"Then lanced a vein, and watch'd returning breath;"
10958,BOOK III.,"It came, but clogg'd with symptoms of his death.                   710"
10959,BOOK III.,"The saddle-bow the noble parts had press'd,"
10960,BOOK III.,All bruised and mortified his manly breast.
10961,BOOK III.,"Him still entranced, and in a litter laid,"
10962,BOOK III.,"They bore from field, and to his bed convey'd."
10963,BOOK III.,"At length he waked, and with a feeble cry,"
10964,BOOK III.,"The word he first pronounced was ""Emily."""
10965,BOOK III.,
10966,BOOK III.,"Mean time the king, though inwardly he mourn'd,"
10967,BOOK III.,"In pomp triumphant to the town return'd,"
10968,BOOK III.,"Attended by the chiefs, who fought the field;"
10969,BOOK III.,"(Now friendly mix'd, and in one troop compell'd.)                  720"
10970,BOOK III.,"Composed his looks to counterfeited cheer,"
10971,BOOK III.,And bade them not for Arcite's life to fear.
10972,BOOK III.,"But that which gladded all the warrior train,"
10973,BOOK III.,"Though most were sorely wounded, none were slain."
10974,BOOK III.,"The surgeons soon despoil'd them of their arms,"
10975,BOOK III.,"And some with salves they cure, and some with charms;"
10976,BOOK III.,"Foment the bruises, and the pains assuage,"
10977,BOOK III.,And heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage.
10978,BOOK III.,"The king in person visits all around,"
10979,BOOK III.,"Comforts the sick, congratulates the sound;                        730"
10980,BOOK III.,"Honours the princely chiefs, rewards the rest,"
10981,BOOK III.,And holds for thrice three days a royal feast.
10982,BOOK III.,None was disgraced; for falling is no shame;
10983,BOOK III.,And cowardice alone is loss of fame.
10984,BOOK III.,The venturous knight is from the saddle thrown;
10985,BOOK III.,"But 'tis the fault of Fortune, not his own,"
10986,BOOK III.,"If crowds and palms the conquering side adorn,"
10987,BOOK III.,The victor under better stars was born:
10988,BOOK III.,"The brave man seeks not popular applause,"
10989,BOOK III.,"Nor, overpower'd with arms, deserts his cause;                     740"
10990,BOOK III.,"Unshamed, though foil'd, he does the best he can;"
10991,BOOK III.,"Force is of brutes, but honour is of man."
10992,BOOK III.,
10993,BOOK III.,"Thus Theseus smiled on all with equal grace,"
10994,BOOK III.,And each was set according to his place;
10995,BOOK III.,"With ease were reconciled the differing parts,"
10996,BOOK III.,For envy never dwells in noble hearts.
10997,BOOK III.,"At length they took their leave, the time expired,"
10998,BOOK III.,"Well pleased, and to their several homes retired."
10999,BOOK III.,
11000,BOOK III.,Mean while the health of Arcite still impairs;
11001,BOOK III.,"From bad proceeds to worse, and mocks the leech's cares            750"
11002,BOOK III.,"Swoln is his breast; his inward pains increase,"
11003,BOOK III.,"All means are used, and all without success."
11004,BOOK III.,"The clotted blood lies heavy on his heart,"
11005,BOOK III.,"Corrupts, and there remains, in spite of art:"
11006,BOOK III.,"Nor breathing veins, nor cupping will prevail;"
11007,BOOK III.,All outward remedies and inward fail:
11008,BOOK III.,"The mould of nature's fabric is destroy'd,"
11009,BOOK III.,"Her vessels discomposed, her virtue void;"
11010,BOOK III.,The bellows of his lungs begin to swell:
11011,BOOK III.,"All out of frame is every secret cell,                             760"
11012,BOOK III.,"Nor can the good receive, nor bad expel."
11013,BOOK III.,"Those breathing organs thus within oppress'd,"
11014,BOOK III.,With venom soon distend the sinews of his breast.
11015,BOOK III.,"Nought profits him to save abandon'd life,"
11016,BOOK III.,"Nor vomit's upward aid, nor downward laxative."
11017,BOOK III.,"The midmost region batter'd and destroy'd,"
11018,BOOK III.,"When nature cannot work, the effect of art is void."
11019,BOOK III.,"For physic can but mend our crazy state,"
11020,BOOK III.,"Patch an old building, not a new create."
11021,BOOK III.,"Arcite is doom'd to die in all his pride,                          770"
11022,BOOK III.,"Must leave his youth, and yield his beauteous bride,"
11023,BOOK III.,"Gain'd hardly, against right, and unenjoy'd."
11024,BOOK III.,"When 'twas declared all hope of life was past,"
11025,BOOK III.,Conscience (that of all physic works the last)
11026,BOOK III.,Caused him to send for Emily in haste.
11027,BOOK III.,"With her, at his desire, came Palamon;"
11028,BOOK III.,"Then on his pillow raised, he thus begun:"
11029,BOOK III.,
11030,BOOK III.,No language can express the smallest part
11031,BOOK III.,"Of what I feel, and suffer in my heart"
11032,BOOK III.,"For you, whom best I love and value most;                          780"
11033,BOOK III.,But to your service I bequeath my ghost;
11034,BOOK III.,"Which from this mortal body when untied,"
11035,BOOK III.,"Unseen, unheard, shall hover at your side;"
11036,BOOK III.,"Nor fright you waking, nor your sleep offend,"
11037,BOOK III.,"But wait officious, and your steps attend:"
11038,BOOK III.,"How I have loved, excuse my faltering tongue,"
11039,BOOK III.,"My spirit's feeble, and my pains are strong:"
11040,BOOK III.,"This I may say, I only grieve to die,"
11041,BOOK III.,Because I lose my charming Emily:
11042,BOOK III.,"To die, when Heaven had put you in my power,                       790"
11043,BOOK III.,Fate could not choose a more malicious hour!
11044,BOOK III.,"What greater curse could envious Fortune give,"
11045,BOOK III.,"Than just to die, when I began to live?"
11046,BOOK III.,"Vain men! how vanishing a bliss we crave,"
11047,BOOK III.,"Now warm in love, now withering in the grave!"
11048,BOOK III.,"Never, oh never more to see the sun!"
11049,BOOK III.,"Still dark, in a damp vault, and still alone!"
11050,BOOK III.,This fate is common; but I lose my breath;
11051,BOOK III.,"Near bliss, and yet not bless'd before my death."
11052,BOOK III.,"Farewell; but take me dying in your arms,                          800"
11053,BOOK III.,'Tis all I can enjoy of all your charms:
11054,BOOK III.,This hand I cannot but in death resign;
11055,BOOK III.,Ah! could I live! but while I live 'tis mine.
11056,BOOK III.,"I feel my end approach, and thus embraced,"
11057,BOOK III.,Am pleased to die; but hear me speak my last:
11058,BOOK III.,"Ah! my sweet foe, for you, and you alone,"
11059,BOOK III.,I broke my faith with injured Palamon.
11060,BOOK III.,"But love the sense of right and wrong confounds,"
11061,BOOK III.,Strong love and proud ambition have no bounds.
11062,BOOK III.,"And much I doubt, should Heaven my life prolong,                   810"
11063,BOOK III.,I should return to justify my wrong:
11064,BOOK III.,"For while my former flames remain within,"
11065,BOOK III.,Repentance is but want of power to sin.
11066,BOOK III.,"With mortal hatred I pursued his life,"
11067,BOOK III.,"Nor he, nor you, were guilty of the strife;"
11068,BOOK III.,"Nor I, but as I loved; yet all combined,"
11069,BOOK III.,"Your beauty, and my impotence of mind;"
11070,BOOK III.,And his concurrent flame that blew my fire;
11071,BOOK III.,For still our kindred souls had one desire.
11072,BOOK III.,He had a moment's right in point of time;                          820
11073,BOOK III.,"Had I seen first, then his had been the crime."
11074,BOOK III.,"Fate made it mine, and justified his right;"
11075,BOOK III.,"Nor holds this earth a more deserving knight,"
11076,BOOK III.,"For virtue, valour, and for noble blood,"
11077,BOOK III.,"Truth, honour, all that is comprised in good;"
11078,BOOK III.,"So help me Heaven, in all the world is none"
11079,BOOK III.,So worthy to be loved as Palamon.
11080,BOOK III.,"He loves you too, with such an holy fire,"
11081,BOOK III.,"As will not, cannot, but with life expire:"
11082,BOOK III.,"Our vow'd affections both have often tried,                        830"
11083,BOOK III.,Nor any love but yours could ours divide.
11084,BOOK III.,"Then, by my love's inviolable band,"
11085,BOOK III.,"By my long suffering, and my short command,"
11086,BOOK III.,"If e'er you plight your vows when I am gone,"
11087,BOOK III.,Have pity on the faithful Palamon.
11088,BOOK III.,
11089,BOOK III.,"This was his last; for Death came on amain,"
11090,BOOK III.,And exercised below his iron reign;
11091,BOOK III.,Then upward to the seat of life he goes:
11092,BOOK III.,"Sense fled before him, what he touch'd he froze:"
11093,BOOK III.,"Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,                        840"
11094,BOOK III.,Though less and less of Emily he saw;
11095,BOOK III.,"So, speechless, for a little space he lay;"
11096,BOOK III.,"Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away."
11097,BOOK III.,
11098,BOOK III.,"But whither went his soul, let such relate"
11099,BOOK III.,Who search the secrets of the future state:
11100,BOOK III.,Divines can say but what themselves believe;
11101,BOOK III.,"Strong proofs they have, but not demonstrative:"
11102,BOOK III.,"For, were all plain, then all sides must agree,"
11103,BOOK III.,And faith itself be lost in certainty.
11104,BOOK III.,"To live uprightly, then, is sure the best,                         850"
11105,BOOK III.,"To save ourselves, and not to damn the rest."
11106,BOOK III.,"The soul of Arcite went where heathens go,"
11107,BOOK III.,"Who better live than we, though less they know."
11108,BOOK III.,
11109,BOOK III.,In Palamon a manly grief appears;
11110,BOOK III.,"Silent, he wept, ashamed to show his tears:"
11111,BOOK III.,"Emilia shriek'd but once, and then, oppress'd"
11112,BOOK III.,"With sorrow, sunk upon her lover's breast:"
11113,BOOK III.,"Till Theseus in his arms convey'd with care,"
11114,BOOK III.,"Far from so sad a sight, the swooning fair."
11115,BOOK III.,'Twere loss of time her sorrow to relate;                          860
11116,BOOK III.,"Ill bears the sex a youthful lover's fate,"
11117,BOOK III.,When just approaching to the nuptial state.
11118,BOOK III.,"But like a low-hung cloud, it rains so fast,"
11119,BOOK III.,"That all at once it falls, and cannot last."
11120,BOOK III.,"The face of things is changed, and Athens now,"
11121,BOOK III.,"That laugh'd so late, becomes the scene of woe:"
11122,BOOK III.,"Matrons and maids, both sexes, every state,"
11123,BOOK III.,With tears lament the knight's untimely fate.
11124,BOOK III.,Nor greater grief in falling Troy was seen
11125,BOOK III.,"For Hector's death; but Hector was not then,                       870"
11126,BOOK III.,"Old men with dust deform'd their hoary hair,"
11127,BOOK III.,"The women beat their breasts, their cheeks they tear."
11128,BOOK III.,"Why wouldst thou go, with one consent they cry,"
11129,BOOK III.,"When thou hadst gold enough, and Emily?"
11130,BOOK III.,
11131,BOOK III.,"Theseus himself, who should have cheer'd the grief"
11132,BOOK III.,"Of others, wanted now the same relief;"
11133,BOOK III.,"Old Egeus only could revive his son,"
11134,BOOK III.,"Who various changes of the world had known,"
11135,BOOK III.,"And strange vicissitudes of human fate,"
11136,BOOK III.,"Still altering, never in a steady state;                           880"
11137,BOOK III.,"Good after ill, and, after pain, delight,"
11138,BOOK III.,Alternate like the scenes of day and night:
11139,BOOK III.,"Since every man who lives, is born to die,"
11140,BOOK III.,"And none can boast sincere felicity,"
11141,BOOK III.,"With equal mind, what happens, let us bear,"
11142,BOOK III.,"Nor joy, nor grieve too much for things beyond our care."
11143,BOOK III.,Like pilgrims to the appointed place we tend;
11144,BOOK III.,"The world's an inn, and death the journey's end."
11145,BOOK III.,"Even kings but play; and when their part is done,"
11146,BOOK III.,"Some other, worse or better, mount the throne.                     890"
11147,BOOK III.,"With words like these the crowd was satisfied,"
11148,BOOK III.,"And so they would have been, had Theseus died."
11149,BOOK III.,"But he, their king, was labouring in his mind,"
11150,BOOK III.,"A fitting place for funeral pomps to find,"
11151,BOOK III.,Which were in honour of the dead design'd.
11152,BOOK III.,"And after long debate, at last he found"
11153,BOOK III.,(As love itself had mark'd the spot of ground)
11154,BOOK III.,"That grove for ever green, that conscious laund,"
11155,BOOK III.,Where he with Palamon fought hand to hand:
11156,BOOK III.,That where he fed his amorous desires                              900
11157,BOOK III.,"With soft complaints, and felt his hottest fires;"
11158,BOOK III.,"There other flames might waste his earthly part,"
11159,BOOK III.,"And burn his limbs, where love had burn'd his heart."
11160,BOOK III.,
11161,BOOK III.,"This once resolved, the peasants were enjoin'd"
11162,BOOK III.,"Sere-wood, and firs, and dodder'd oaks to find."
11163,BOOK III.,"With sounding axes to the grove they go,"
11164,BOOK III.,"Fell, split, and lay the fuel on a row,"
11165,BOOK III.,"Vulcanian food: a bier is next prepared,"
11166,BOOK III.,"On which the lifeless body should be rear'd,"
11167,BOOK III.,"Cover'd with cloth of gold, on which was laid                      910"
11168,BOOK III.,"The corpse of Arcite, in like robes array'd."
11169,BOOK III.,"White gloves were on his hands, and on his head"
11170,BOOK III.,"A wreath of laurel, mix'd with myrtle spread."
11171,BOOK III.,"A sword keen-edged within his right he held,"
11172,BOOK III.,The warlike emblem of the conquer'd field:
11173,BOOK III.,Bare was his manly visage on the bier:
11174,BOOK III.,Menaced his countenance; even in death severe.
11175,BOOK III.,"Then to the palace-hall they bore the knight,"
11176,BOOK III.,"To lie in solemn state, a public sight."
11177,BOOK III.,"Groans, cries, and howlings fill the crowded place,                920"
11178,BOOK III.,And unaffected sorrow sate on every face.
11179,BOOK III.,"Sad Palamon above the rest appears,"
11180,BOOK III.,"In sable garments, dew'd with gushing tears:"
11181,BOOK III.,"His auburn locks on either shoulder flow'd,"
11182,BOOK III.,Which to the funeral of his friend he vow'd:
11183,BOOK III.,"But Emily, as chief, was next his side,"
11184,BOOK III.,"A virgin-widow, and a mourning bride."
11185,BOOK III.,And that the princely obsequies might be
11186,BOOK III.,"Perform'd according to his high degree,"
11187,BOOK III.,"The steed, that bore him living to the fight,                      930"
11188,BOOK III.,"Was trapp'd with polish'd steel, all shining bright,"
11189,BOOK III.,And cover'd with the achievements of the knight.
11190,BOOK III.,"The riders rode abreast, and one his shield,"
11191,BOOK III.,His lance of cornel-wood another held;
11192,BOOK III.,"The third his bow, and, glorious to behold,"
11193,BOOK III.,"The costly quiver, all of burnish'd gold."
11194,BOOK III.,"The noblest of the Grecians next appear,"
11195,BOOK III.,"And, weeping, on their shoulders bore the bier;"
11196,BOOK III.,"With sober pace they march'd, and often stay'd,"
11197,BOOK III.,And through the master-street the corpse convey'd.                 940
11198,BOOK III.,"The houses to their tops with black were spread,"
11199,BOOK III.,And even the pavements were with mourning hid.
11200,BOOK III.,"The right side of the pall old Egeus kept,"
11201,BOOK III.,And on the left the royal Theseus wept;
11202,BOOK III.,"Each bore a golden bowl, of work divine,"
11203,BOOK III.,"With honey fill'd, and milk, and mix'd with ruddy wine."
11204,BOOK III.,"Then Palamon, the kinsman of the slain,"
11205,BOOK III.,And after him appear'd the illustrious train.
11206,BOOK III.,"To grace the pomp, came Emily the bright,"
11207,BOOK III.,"With cover'd fire, the funeral pile to light.                      950"
11208,BOOK III.,"With high devotion was the service made,"
11209,BOOK III.,And all the rites of Pagan honour paid:
11210,BOOK III.,"So lofty was the pile, a Parthian bow,"
11211,BOOK III.,"With vigour drawn, must send the shaft below."
11212,BOOK III.,"The bottom was full twenty fathom broad,"
11213,BOOK III.,With crackling straw beneath in due proportion strew'd.
11214,BOOK III.,"The fabric seem'd a wood of rising green,"
11215,BOOK III.,"With sulphur and bitumen cast between,"
11216,BOOK III.,"To feed the flames: the trees were unctuous fir,"
11217,BOOK III.,"And mountain-ash, the mother of the spear;                         960"
11218,BOOK III.,"The mourner-yew, and builder oak were there;"
11219,BOOK III.,"The beech, the swimming alder, and the plane,"
11220,BOOK III.,"Hard box, and linden of a softer grain,"
11221,BOOK III.,"And laurels, which the gods for conquering chiefs ordain."
11222,BOOK III.,"How they were rank'd, shall rest untold by me,"
11223,BOOK III.,With nameless Nymphs that lived in every tree;
11224,BOOK III.,"Nor how the Dryads, or the woodland train,"
11225,BOOK III.,"Disherited, ran howling o'er the plain:"
11226,BOOK III.,"Nor how the birds to foreign seats repair'd,"
11227,BOOK III.,"Or beasts, that bolted out, and saw the forest bared:              970"
11228,BOOK III.,"Nor how the ground, now clear'd, with ghastly fright"
11229,BOOK III.,"Beheld the sudden sun, a stranger to the light."
11230,BOOK III.,
11231,BOOK III.,"The straw, as first I said, was laid below;"
11232,BOOK III.,Of chips and sere-wood was the second row;
11233,BOOK III.,"The third of greens, and timber newly fell'd;"
11234,BOOK III.,"The fourth high stage the fragrant odours held,"
11235,BOOK III.,"And pearls, and precious stones, and rich array;"
11236,BOOK III.,"In midst of which, embalm'd, the body lay."
11237,BOOK III.,"The service sung, the maid with mourning eyes"
11238,BOOK III.,The stubble fired; the smouldering flames arise:                   980
11239,BOOK III.,"This office done, she sunk upon the ground;"
11240,BOOK III.,"But what she spoke, recover'd from her swound,"
11241,BOOK III.,I want the wit in moving words to dress;
11242,BOOK III.,But by themselves the tender sex may guess.
11243,BOOK III.,"While the devouring fire was burning fast,"
11244,BOOK III.,Rich jewels in the flame the wealthy cast;
11245,BOOK III.,"And some their shields, and some their lances threw,"
11246,BOOK III.,And gave their warrior's ghost a warrior's due.
11247,BOOK III.,"Full bowls of wine, of honey, milk, and blood"
11248,BOOK III.,"Were pour'd upon the pile of burning wood,                         990"
11249,BOOK III.,"And hissing flames receive, and hungry lick the food."
11250,BOOK III.,Then thrice the mounted squadrons ride around
11251,BOOK III.,"The fire, and Arcite's name they thrice resound:"
11252,BOOK III.,"Hail, and farewell! they shouted thrice amain,"
11253,BOOK III.,"Thrice facing to the left, and thrice they turn'd again:"
11254,BOOK III.,"Still as they turn'd, they beat their clattering shields;"
11255,BOOK III.,The women mix their cries; and clamour fills the fields.
11256,BOOK III.,"The warlike wakes continued all the night,"
11257,BOOK III.,And funeral games were play'd at new returning light;
11258,BOOK III.,"Who naked wrestled best, besmear'd with oil,                      1000"
11259,BOOK III.,"Or who with gauntlets gave or took the foil,"
11260,BOOK III.,"I will not tell you, nor would you attend;"
11261,BOOK III.,But briefly haste to my long story's end.
11262,BOOK III.,
11263,BOOK III.,"I pass the rest; the year was fully mourn'd,"
11264,BOOK III.,And Palamon long since to Thebes returned:
11265,BOOK III.,"When, by the Grecians' general consent,"
11266,BOOK III.,At Athens Theseus held his parliament:
11267,BOOK III.,"Among the laws that pass'd, it was decreed,"
11268,BOOK III.,That conquer'd Thebes from bondage should be freed;
11269,BOOK III.,"Reserving homage to the Athenian throne,                          1010"
11270,BOOK III.,To which the sovereign summon'd Palamon.
11271,BOOK III.,"Unknowing of the cause, he took his way,"
11272,BOOK III.,"Mournful in mind, and still in black array."
11273,BOOK III.,
11274,BOOK III.,"The monarch mounts the throne, and, placed on high,"
11275,BOOK III.,Commands into the court the beauteous Emily:
11276,BOOK III.,"So call'd, she came; the senate rose, and paid"
11277,BOOK III.,Becoming reverence to the royal maid.
11278,BOOK III.,"And first, soft whispers through the assembly went;"
11279,BOOK III.,With silent wonder then they watch'd the event:
11280,BOOK III.,"All hush'd, the king arose with awful grace,                      1020"
11281,BOOK III.,"Deep thought was in his breast, and counsel in his face."
11282,BOOK III.,At length he sigh'd; and having first prepared
11283,BOOK III.,"The attentive audience, thus his will declared:"
11284,BOOK III.,
11285,BOOK III.,"The Cause and Spring of motion, from above,"
11286,BOOK III.,Hung down on earth the golden chain of Love:
11287,BOOK III.,"Great was the effect, and high was his intent,"
11288,BOOK III.,When peace among the jarring seeds he sent.
11289,BOOK III.,"Fire, flood, and earth, and air by this were bound,"
11290,BOOK III.,"And Love, the common link, the new creation crown'd."
11291,BOOK III.,"The chain still holds; for though the forms decay,                1030"
11292,BOOK III.,Eternal matter never wears away:
11293,BOOK III.,"The same First Mover certain bounds has placed,"
11294,BOOK III.,How long those perishable forms shall last:
11295,BOOK III.,Nor can they last beyond the time assign'd
11296,BOOK III.,"By that all-seeing, and all-making mind:"
11297,BOOK III.,Shorten their hours they may; for will is free;
11298,BOOK III.,But never pass the appointed destiny.
11299,BOOK III.,"So men oppress'd, when weary of their breath,"
11300,BOOK III.,"Throw off the burden, and suborn their death."
11301,BOOK III.,"Then since those forms begin, and have their end,                 1040"
11302,BOOK III.,On some unalter'd cause they sure depend:
11303,BOOK III.,Parts of the whole are we; but God the whole;
11304,BOOK III.,"Who gives us life, and animating soul."
11305,BOOK III.,For nature cannot from a part derive
11306,BOOK III.,"That being, which the whole can only give:"
11307,BOOK III.,"He perfect, stable; but imperfect we,"
11308,BOOK III.,"Subject to change, and different in degree;"
11309,BOOK III.,"Plants, beasts, and man; and as our organs are,"
11310,BOOK III.,We more or less of his perfection share.
11311,BOOK III.,"But by a long descent, the ethereal fire                          1050"
11312,BOOK III.,"Corrupts; and forms, the mortal part, expire:"
11313,BOOK III.,"As he withdraws his virtue, so they pass,"
11314,BOOK III.,And the same matter makes another mass:
11315,BOOK III.,"This law the Omniscient Power was pleased to give,"
11316,BOOK III.,That every kind should by succession live:
11317,BOOK III.,"That individuals die, His will ordains;"
11318,BOOK III.,The propagated species still remains.

11337,BOOK III.,"First vegetive, then feels, and reasons last;"
11338,BOOK III.,"Rich of three souls, and lives all three to waste."
11339,BOOK III.,Some thus; but thousands more in flower of age:

11382,BOOK III.,For which already I have gain'd the assent
11383,BOOK III.,Of my free people in full parliament.
11384,BOOK III.,"Long love to her has borne the faithful knight,"
11385,BOOK III.,"And well deserved, had fortune done him right:"
11386,BOOK III.,'Tis time to mend her fault; since Emily

11392,BOOK III.,"And were he less, yet years of service past,"
11393,BOOK III.,From grateful souls exact reward at last:
11394,BOOK III.,Pity is Heaven's and yours; nor can she find
11395,BOOK III.,A throne so soft as in a woman's mind.
11396,BOOK III.,"He said; she blush'd; and as o'er-awed by might,"

11398,BOOK III.,Then turning to the Theban thus he said:
11399,BOOK III.,Small arguments are needful to persuade
11400,BOOK III.,Your temper to comply with my command;
11401,BOOK III.,"And speaking thus, he gave Emilia's hand.                         1140"
11402,BOOK III.,"Smiled Venus, to behold her own true knight"
11403,BOOK III.,"Obtain the conquest, though he lost the fight;"
11404,BOOK III.,And bless'd with nuptial bliss the sweet laborious night.
11405,BOOK III.,"Eros, and Anteros, on either side,"
11406,BOOK III.,"One fired the bridegroom, and one warm'd the bride;"
11407,BOOK III.,"And long-attending Hymen from above,"

11412,BOOK III.,"Secure repose, and kindness undeceived."
11413,BOOK III.,"Thus Heaven, beyond the compass of his thought,"

12354,A VISION.,"Scorning the scorner sleep, from bed I sprung;"
12355,A VISION.,"And dressing, by the moon, in loose array,"
12356,A VISION.,"Pass'd out in open air, preventing day,"
12357,A VISION.,"And sought a goodly grove, as fancy led my way."
12358,A VISION.,Straight as a line in beauteous order stood
12359,A VISION.,Of oaks unshorn a venerable wood;
12360,A VISION.,"Fresh was the grass beneath, and every tree,                        40"
12361,A VISION.,"At distance planted in a due degree,"
12362,A VISION.,Their branching arms in air with equal space
12363,A VISION.,Stretch'd to their neighbours with a long embrace:
12364,A VISION.,"And the new leaves on every bough were seen,"
12365,A VISION.,"Some ruddy colour'd, some of lighter green."
12366,A VISION.,"The painted birds, companions of the spring,"
12367,A VISION.,"Hopping from spray to spray, were heard to sing."
12368,A VISION.,"Both eyes and ears received a like delight,"
12369,A VISION.,"Enchanting music, and a charming sight."
12370,A VISION.,"On Philomel I fix'd my whole desire,                                50"
12371,A VISION.,And listen'd for the queen of all the quire;
12372,A VISION.,Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing;
12373,A VISION.,And wanted yet an omen to the spring.
12374,A VISION.,
12375,A VISION.,"Attending long in vain, I took the way"
12376,A VISION.,Which through a path but scarcely printed lay;
12377,A VISION.,"In narrow mazes oft it seem'd to meet,"
12378,A VISION.,And look'd as lightly press'd by fairy feet.
12379,A VISION.,"Wandering I walk'd alone, for still methought"
12380,A VISION.,To some strange end so strange a path was wrought:
12381,A VISION.,"At last it led me where an arbour stood,                            60"
12382,A VISION.,The sacred receptacle of the wood:
12383,A VISION.,"This place unmark'd, though oft I walk'd the green,"
12384,A VISION.,In all my progress I had never seen:
12385,A VISION.,"And seized at once with wonder and delight,"
12386,A VISION.,"Gazed all around me, new to the transporting sight."
12387,A VISION.,"'Twas bench'd with turf, and goodly to be seen,"
12388,A VISION.,The thick young grass arose in fresher green:
12389,A VISION.,"The mound was newly made, no sight could pass"
12390,A VISION.,"Betwixt the nice partitions of the grass,"
12391,A VISION.,The well-united sods so closely lay;                                70
12392,A VISION.,And all around the shades defended it from day;
12393,A VISION.,"For sycamores with eglantine were spread,"
12394,A VISION.,"A hedge about the sides, a covering overhead."
12395,A VISION.,"And so the fragrant brier was wove between,"
12396,A VISION.,"The sycamore and flowers were mixed with green,"
12397,A VISION.,"That nature seem'd to vary the delight,"
12398,A VISION.,And satisfied at once the smell and sight.
12399,A VISION.,The master workman of the bower was known
12400,A VISION.,"Through fairy-lands, and built for Oberon;"
12401,A VISION.,"Who twining leaves with such proportion drew,                       80"
12402,A VISION.,"They rose by measure, and by rule they grew;"
12403,A VISION.,No mortal tongue can half the beauty tell;
12404,A VISION.,For none but hands divine could work so well.
12405,A VISION.,"Both roof and sides were like a parlour made,"
12406,A VISION.,"A soft recess, and a cool summer shade;"
12407,A VISION.,"The hedge was set so thick, no foreign eye"
12408,A VISION.,The persons placed within it could espy;
12409,A VISION.,"But all that pass'd without with ease was seen,"
12410,A VISION.,As if nor fence nor tree was placed between.
12411,A VISION.,'Twas border'd with a field; and some was plain                     90
12412,A VISION.,"With grass, and some was sow'd with rising grain."
12413,A VISION.,That (now the dew with spangles deck'd the ground)
12414,A VISION.,A sweeter spot of earth was never found.
12415,A VISION.,"I look'd, and look'd, and still with new delight;"
12416,A VISION.,"Such joy my soul, such pleasures fill'd my sight;"
12417,A VISION.,"And the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath,"
12418,A VISION.,Whose odours were of power to raise from death.
12419,A VISION.,"Nor sullen discontent, nor anxious care,"
12420,A VISION.,"Even though brought thither, could inhabit there:"
12421,A VISION.,But thence they fled as from their mortal foe;                     100
12422,A VISION.,For this sweet place could only pleasure know.
12423,A VISION.,
12424,A VISION.,"Thus as I mused, I cast aside my eye,"
12425,A VISION.,And saw a medlar-tree was planted nigh.
12426,A VISION.,"The spreading branches made a goodly show,"
12427,A VISION.,And full of opening blooms was every bough:
12428,A VISION.,"A goldfinch there I saw, with gaudy pride"
12429,A VISION.,"Of painted plumes, that hopp'd from side to side,"
12430,A VISION.,Still pecking as she pass'd; and still she drew
12431,A VISION.,"The sweets from every flower, and suck'd the dew:"
12432,A VISION.,"Sufficed at length, she warbled in her throat,                     110"
12433,A VISION.,"And tuned her voice to many a merry note,"
12434,A VISION.,"But indistinct, and neither sweet nor clear,"
12435,A VISION.,"Yet such as soothed my soul, and pleased my ear."
12436,A VISION.,
12437,A VISION.,"Her short performance was no sooner tried,"
12438,A VISION.,"When she I sought, the nightingale, replied:"
12439,A VISION.,"So sweet, so shrill, so variously she sung,"
12440,A VISION.,"That the grove echoed, and the valleys rung;"
12441,A VISION.,"And I so ravish'd with her heavenly note,"
12442,A VISION.,"I stood entranced, and had no room for thought,"
12443,A VISION.,"But all o'er-power'd with ecstasy of bliss,                        120"
12444,A VISION.,Was in a pleasing dream of paradise.
12445,A VISION.,"At length I waked, and looking round the bower,"
12446,A VISION.,"Search'd every tree, and pry'd on every flower,"
12447,A VISION.,If any where by chance I might espy
12448,A VISION.,The rural poet of the melody;
12449,A VISION.,For still methought she sung not far away:
12450,A VISION.,At last I found her on a laurel spray.
12451,A VISION.,"Close by my side she sat, and fair in sight,"
12452,A VISION.,"Full in a line, against her opposite;"
12453,A VISION.,Where stood with eglantine the laurel twined;                      130
12454,A VISION.,And both their native sweets were well conjoin'd.
12455,A VISION.,
12456,A VISION.,"On the green bank I sat, and listen'd long;"
12457,A VISION.,(Sitting was more convenient for the song):
12458,A VISION.,"Nor till her lay was ended could I move,"
12459,A VISION.,But wish'd to dwell for ever in the grove.
12460,A VISION.,"Only methought the time too swiftly pass'd,"
12461,A VISION.,And every note I fear'd would be the last.
12462,A VISION.,"My sight and smell, and hearing were employ'd,"
12463,A VISION.,And all three senses in full gust enjoy'd.
12464,A VISION.,"And what alone did all the rest surpass,                           140"
12465,A VISION.,The sweet possession of the fairy place;
12466,A VISION.,"Single, and conscious to myself alone"
12467,A VISION.,Of pleasures to the excluded world unknown:
12468,A VISION.,"Pleasures which nowhere else were to be found,"
12469,A VISION.,And all Elysium in a spot of ground.
12470,A VISION.,
12471,A VISION.,"Thus while I sat intent to see and hear,"
12472,A VISION.,"And drew perfumes of more than vital air,"
12473,A VISION.,All suddenly I heard the approaching sound
12474,A VISION.,Of vocal music on the enchanted ground:
12475,A VISION.,"A host of saints it seem'd, so full the quire;                     150"
12476,A VISION.,As if the bless'd above did all conspire
12477,A VISION.,"To join their voices, and neglect the lyre."
12478,A VISION.,At length there issued from the grove behind
12479,A VISION.,A fair assembly of the female kind:
12480,A VISION.,"A train less fair, as ancient fathers tell,"
12481,A VISION.,Seduced the sons of heaven to rebel.
12482,A VISION.,"I pass their form, and every charming grace,"
12483,A VISION.,Less than an angel would their worth debase:
12484,A VISION.,"But their attire, like liveries of a kind,"
12485,A VISION.,"All rich and rare, is fresh within my mind.                        160"
12486,A VISION.,"In velvet white as snow the troop was gown'd,"
12487,A VISION.,The seams with sparkling emeralds set around;
12488,A VISION.,Their hoods and sleeves the same; and purfled o'er
12489,A VISION.,"With diamonds, pearls, and all the shining store"
12490,A VISION.,"Of eastern pomp: their long descending train,"
12491,A VISION.,"With rubies edged, and sapphires, swept the plain:"
12492,A VISION.,"High on their heads, with jewels richly set,"
12493,A VISION.,Each lady wore a radiant coronet.
12494,A VISION.,"Beneath the circles, all the quire was graced"
12495,A VISION.,With chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed:                170
12496,A VISION.,"Of laurel some, of woodbine many more;"
12497,A VISION.,And wreaths of Agnus castus[75] others bore;
12498,A VISION.,"These last, who with those virgin crowns were dress'd,"
12499,A VISION.,Appear'd in higher honour than the rest.
12500,A VISION.,They danced around: but in the midst was seen
12501,A VISION.,A lady of a more majestic mien;
12502,A VISION.,"By stature, and by beauty mark'd their sovereign queen"
12503,A VISION.,
12504,A VISION.,She in the midst began with sober grace;
12505,A VISION.,Her servants' eyes were fix'd upon her face;
12506,A VISION.,"And as she moved or turn'd, her motions view'd,                    180"
12507,A VISION.,"Her measures kept, and step by step pursued."
12508,A VISION.,"Methought she trod the ground with greater grace,"
12509,A VISION.,With more of godhead shining in her face;
12510,A VISION.,"And as in beauty she surpass'd the quire,"
12511,A VISION.,"So, nobler than the rest, was her attire."
12512,A VISION.,"A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,"
12513,A VISION.,"Plain without pomp, and rich without a show:"
12514,A VISION.,A branch of Agnus castus in her hand
12515,A VISION.,She bore aloft (her sceptre of command);
12516,A VISION.,"Admired, adored by all the circling crowd,                         190"
12517,A VISION.,"For wheresoe'er she turn'd her face, they bow'd:"
12518,A VISION.,"And as she danced, a roundelay she sung,"
12519,A VISION.,"In honour of the laurel, ever young:"
12520,A VISION.,"She raised her voice on high, and sung so clear,"
12521,A VISION.,The fawns came scudding from the groves to hear:
12522,A VISION.,And all the bending forest lent an ear.
12523,A VISION.,"At every close she made, the attending throng"
12524,A VISION.,"Replied, and bore the burden of the song:"
12525,A VISION.,"So just, so small, yet in so sweet a note,"
12526,A VISION.,It seem'd the music melted in the throat.                          200
12527,A VISION.,
12528,A VISION.,"Thus dancing on, and singing as they danced,"
12529,A VISION.,"They to the middle of the mead advanced,"
12530,A VISION.,"Till round my arbour a new ring they made,"
12531,A VISION.,And footed it about the sacred shade.
12532,A VISION.,"O'erjoy'd to see the jolly troops so near,"
12533,A VISION.,"But somewhat awed, I shook with holy fear;"
12534,A VISION.,"Yet not so much, but what I noted well"
12535,A VISION.,Who did the most in song or dance excel.
12536,A VISION.,
12537,A VISION.,"Not long I had observed, when from afar"
12538,A VISION.,I heard a sudden symphony of war;                                  210
12539,A VISION.,"The neighing coursers, and the soldiers cry,"
12540,A VISION.,"And sounding trumps, that seem'd to tear the sky:"
12541,A VISION.,"I saw soon after this, behind the grove"
12542,A VISION.,"From whence the ladies did in order move,"
12543,A VISION.,"Come issuing out in arms a warrior train,"
12544,A VISION.,That like a deluge pour'd upon the plain;
12545,A VISION.,"On barbed steeds they rode in proud array,"
12546,A VISION.,"Thick as the college of the bees in May,"
12547,A VISION.,"When swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly,"
12548,A VISION.,"New to the flowers, and intercept the sky,                         220"
12549,A VISION.,"So fierce they drove, their coursers were so fleet,"
12550,A VISION.,That the turf trembled underneath their feet.
12551,A VISION.,
12552,A VISION.,"To tell their costly furniture were long,"
12553,A VISION.,The summer's day would end before the song:
12554,A VISION.,"To purchase but the tenth of all their store,"
12555,A VISION.,Would make the mighty Persian monarch poor.
12556,A VISION.,"Yet what I can, I will; before the rest"
12557,A VISION.,"The trumpets issued, in white mantles dress'd,"
12558,A VISION.,"A numerous troop, and all their heads around"
12559,A VISION.,"With chaplets green of cerrial-oak[76] were crown'd,               230"
12560,A VISION.,And at each trumpet was a banner bound;
12561,A VISION.,"Which, waving in the wind, displayed at large"
12562,A VISION.,"Their master's coat of arms, and knightly charge."
12563,A VISION.,"Broad were the banners, and of snowy hue,"
12564,A VISION.,A purer web the silk-worm never drew.
12565,A VISION.,"The chief about their necks the scutcheons wore,"
12566,A VISION.,With orient pearls and jewels powder'd o'er:
12567,A VISION.,"Broad were their collars too, and every one"
12568,A VISION.,Was set about with many a costly stone.
12569,A VISION.,"Next these, of kings-at-arms a goodly train                        240"
12570,A VISION.,In proud array came prancing o'er the plain:
12571,A VISION.,"Their cloaks were cloth of silver mix'd with gold,"
12572,A VISION.,And garlands green around their temples roll'd:
12573,A VISION.,"Rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed,"
12574,A VISION.,"With sapphires, diamonds, and with rubies graced:"
12575,A VISION.,"And as the trumpets their appearance made,"
12576,A VISION.,So these in habits were alike array'd;
12577,A VISION.,"But with a pace more sober, and more slow;"
12578,A VISION.,"And twenty, rank in rank, they rode a-row."
12579,A VISION.,"The pursuivants came next, in number more;                         250"
12580,A VISION.,"And, like the heralds, each his scutcheon bore:"
12581,A VISION.,"Clad in white velvet all their troop they led,"
12582,A VISION.,With each an oaken chaplet on his head.
12583,A VISION.,
12584,A VISION.,"Nine royal knights in equal rank succeed,"
12585,A VISION.,Each warrior mounted on a fiery steed;
12586,A VISION.,In golden armour glorious to behold;
12587,A VISION.,The rivets of their arms were nail'd with gold.
12588,A VISION.,Their surcoats of white ermine fur were made;
12589,A VISION.,"With cloth of gold between, that cast a glittering shade."
12590,A VISION.,The trappings of their steeds were of the same;                    260
12591,A VISION.,"The golden fringe even set the ground on flame,"
12592,A VISION.,And drew a precious trail: a crown divine
12593,A VISION.,Of laurel did about their temples twine.
12594,A VISION.,
12595,A VISION.,"Three henchmen were for every knight assign'd,"
12596,A VISION.,"All in rich livery clad, and of a kind;"
12597,A VISION.,"White velvet, but unshorn, for cloaks they wore,"
12598,A VISION.,And each within his hand a truncheon bore:
12599,A VISION.,The foremost held a helm of rare device;
12600,A VISION.,A prince's ransom would not pay the price.
12601,A VISION.,"The second bore the buckler of his knight,                         270"
12602,A VISION.,"The third of cornel-wood a spear upright,"
12603,A VISION.,"Headed with piercing steel, and polish'd bright."
12604,A VISION.,"Like to their lords their equipage was seen,"
12605,A VISION.,And all their foreheads crown'd with garlands green.
12606,A VISION.,
12607,A VISION.,"And after these came, arm'd with spear and shield,"
12608,A VISION.,A host so great as cover'd all the field:
12609,A VISION.,"And all their foreheads, like the knights before,"
12610,A VISION.,"With laurels ever-green were shaded o'er,"
12611,A VISION.,"Or oak, or other leaves of lasting kind,"
12612,A VISION.,"Tenacious of the stem, and firm against the wind.                  280"
12613,A VISION.,"Some in their hands, beside the lance and shield,"
12614,A VISION.,"The boughs of woodbine, or of hawthorn held,"
12615,A VISION.,"Or branches for their mystic emblems took,"
12616,A VISION.,"Of palm, of laurel, and of cerrial-oak."
12617,A VISION.,"Thus marching to the trumpet's lofty sound,"
12618,A VISION.,"Drawn in two lines adverse they wheel'd around,"
12619,A VISION.,And in the middle meadow took their ground.
12620,A VISION.,"Among themselves the tourney they divide,"
12621,A VISION.,In equal squadrons ranged on either side.
12622,A VISION.,"Then turn'd their horses' heads, and man to man,                   290"
12623,A VISION.,"And steed to steed opposed, the jousts began."
12624,A VISION.,"They lightly set their lances in the rest,"
12625,A VISION.,"And, at the sign, against each other press'd:"
12626,A VISION.,They met. I sitting at my ease beheld
12627,A VISION.,"The mix'd events, and fortunes of the field."
12628,A VISION.,"Some broke their spears, some tumbled horse and man,"
12629,A VISION.,And round the field the lighten'd coursers ran.
12630,A VISION.,"An hour and more, like tides, in equal sway"
12631,A VISION.,"They rush'd, and won by turns, and lost the day:"
12632,A VISION.,At length the nine (who still together held)                       300
12633,A VISION.,"Their fainting foes to shameful flight compell'd,"
12634,A VISION.,And with resistless force o'er-ran the field.
12635,A VISION.,"Thus, to their fame, when finish'd was the fight,"
12636,A VISION.,The victors from their lofty steeds alight:
12637,A VISION.,"Like them dismounted all the warlike train,"
12638,A VISION.,"And two by two proceeded o'er the plain,"
12639,A VISION.,"Till to the fair assembly they advanced,"
12640,A VISION.,Who near the secret arbour sung and danced.
12641,A VISION.,
12642,A VISION.,"The ladies left their measures at the sight,"
12643,A VISION.,"To meet the chiefs returning from the fight,                       310"
12644,A VISION.,And each with open arms embraced her chosen knight.
12645,A VISION.,"Amid the plain a spreading laurel stood,"
12646,A VISION.,The grace and ornament of all the wood:
12647,A VISION.,"That pleasing shade they sought, a soft retreat"
12648,A VISION.,"From sudden April showers, a shelter from the heat:"
12649,A VISION.,Her leafy arms with such extent were spread.
12650,A VISION.,"So near the clouds was her aspiring head,"
12651,A VISION.,"That hosts of birds, that wing the liquid air,"
12652,A VISION.,"Perch'd in the boughs, had nightly lodging there:"
12653,A VISION.,And flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far                     320
12654,A VISION.,"Might hear the rattling hail, and wintry war;"
12655,A VISION.,"From heaven's inclemency here found retreat,"
12656,A VISION.,"Enjoy'd the cool, and shunn'd the scorching heat:"
12657,A VISION.,A hundred knights might there at ease abide;
12658,A VISION.,And every knight a lady by his side:
12659,A VISION.,"The trunk itself such odours did bequeath,"
12660,A VISION.,That a Moluccan[77] breeze to these was common breath.
12661,A VISION.,"The lords and ladies here, approaching, paid"
12662,A VISION.,"Their homage, with a low obeisance made;"
12663,A VISION.,And seem'd to venerate the sacred shade.                           330
12664,A VISION.,"These rites perform'd, their pleasures they pursue,"
12665,A VISION.,"With song of love, and mix with measures new;"
12666,A VISION.,"Around the holy tree their dance they frame,"
12667,A VISION.,And every champion leads his chosen dame.
12668,A VISION.,
12669,A VISION.,"I cast my sight upon the farther field,"
12670,A VISION.,And a fresh object of delight beheld:
12671,A VISION.,For from the region of the West I heard
12672,A VISION.,"New music sound, and a new troop appear'd;"
12673,A VISION.,"Of knights and ladies mix'd, a jolly band,"
12674,A VISION.,"But all on foot they march'd, and hand in hand.                    340"
12675,A VISION.,
12676,A VISION.,The ladies dress'd in rich symars were seen
12677,A VISION.,"Of Florence satin, flower'd with white and green,"
12678,A VISION.,And for a shade betwixt the bloomy gridelin.
12679,A VISION.,The borders of their petticoats below
12680,A VISION.,Were guarded thick with rubies on a row;
12681,A VISION.,And every damsel wore upon her head
12682,A VISION.,Of flowers a garland blended white and red.
12683,A VISION.,"Attired in mantles all the knights were seen,"
12684,A VISION.,That gratified the view with cheerful green:
12685,A VISION.,"Their chaplets of their ladies' colours were,                      350"
12686,A VISION.,"Composed of white and red, to shade their shining hair."
12687,A VISION.,Before the merry troop the minstrels play'd;
12688,A VISION.,"All in their masters' liveries were array'd,"
12689,A VISION.,"And clad in green, and on their temples wore"
12690,A VISION.,The chaplets white and red their ladies bore.
12691,A VISION.,"Their instruments were various in their kind,"
12692,A VISION.,"Some for the bow, and some for breathing wind;"
12693,A VISION.,"The sawtry, pipe, and hautboy's noisy band,"
12694,A VISION.,And the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand.
12695,A VISION.,A tuft of daisies on a flowery lea                                 360
12696,A VISION.,"They saw, and thitherward they bent their way;"
12697,A VISION.,"To this both knights and dames their homage made,"
12698,A VISION.,And due obeisance to the daisy paid.
12699,A VISION.,"And then the band of flutes began to play,"
12700,A VISION.,To which a lady sung a virelay:[78]
12701,A VISION.,And still at every close she would repeat
12702,A VISION.,"The burden of the song, _The daisy is so sweet,"
12703,A VISION.,"The daisy is so sweet_: when she begun,"
12704,A VISION.,The troop of knights and dames continued on.
12705,A VISION.,"The concert and the voice so charm'd my ear,"
12706,A VISION.,"And soothed my soul, that it was heaven to hear.                   370"
12707,A VISION.,
12708,A VISION.,But soon their pleasure pass'd: at noon of day
12709,A VISION.,The sun with sultry beams began to play:
12710,A VISION.,"Not Sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high,"
12711,A VISION.,When with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky:
12712,A VISION.,Then droop'd the fading flowers (their beauty fled)
12713,A VISION.,"And closed their sickly eyes, and hung the head;"
12714,A VISION.,"And rivell'd up with heat, lay dying in their bed."
12715,A VISION.,"The ladies gasp'd, and scarcely could respire;"
12716,A VISION.,"The breath they drew, no longer air but fire;                      380"
12717,A VISION.,"The fainty knights were scorch'd, and knew not where"
12718,A VISION.,"To run for shelter, for no shade was near;"
12719,A VISION.,And after this the gathering clouds amain
12720,A VISION.,Pour'd down a storm of rattling hail and rain;
12721,A VISION.,"And lightning flash'd betwixt: the field, and flowers,"
12722,A VISION.,"Burnt up before, were buried in the showers."
12723,A VISION.,"The ladies and the knights, no shelter nigh,"
12724,A VISION.,"Bare to the weather and the wintry sky,"
12725,A VISION.,"Were drooping wet, disconsolate, and wan,"
12726,A VISION.,And through their thin array received the rain;                    390
12727,A VISION.,"While those in white, protected by the tree,"
12728,A VISION.,"Saw pass in vain the assault, and stood from danger free;"
12729,A VISION.,"But as compassion moved their gentle minds,"
12730,A VISION.,"When ceased the storm, and silent were the winds,"
12731,A VISION.,"Displeased at what, not suffering they had seen,"
12732,A VISION.,They went to cheer the faction of the green.
12733,A VISION.,"The queen in white array, before her band,"
12734,A VISION.,"Saluting, took her rival by the hand;"
12735,A VISION.,"So did the knights and dames, with courtly grace,"
12736,A VISION.,And with behaviour sweet their foes embrace;                       400
12737,A VISION.,Then thus the queen with laurel on her brow--
12738,A VISION.,"Fair sister, I have suffer'd in your woe;"
12739,A VISION.,Nor shall be wanting aught within my power
12740,A VISION.,For your relief in my refreshing bower.
12741,A VISION.,"That other answer'd with a lowly look,"
12742,A VISION.,And soon the gracious invitation took:
12743,A VISION.,For ill at ease both she and all her train
12744,A VISION.,"The scorching sun had borne, and beating rain."
12745,A VISION.,"Like courtesy was used by all in white,"
12746,A VISION.,"Each dame a dame received, and every knight a knight.              410"
12747,A VISION.,The laurel champions with their swords invade
12748,A VISION.,"The neighbouring forests, where the jousts were made,"
12749,A VISION.,"And serewood from the rotten hedges took,"
12750,A VISION.,"And seeds of latent fire, from flints provoke:"
12751,A VISION.,"A cheerful blaze arose, and by the fire"
12752,A VISION.,"They warm'd their frozen feet, and dried their wet attire."
12753,A VISION.,"Refresh'd with heat, the ladies sought around"
12754,A VISION.,"For virtuous herbs, which, gather'd from the ground,"
12755,A VISION.,"They squeezed the juice, and cooling ointment made,"
12756,A VISION.,"Which on their sun-burnt cheeks, and their chapt skins they laid:  420"
12757,A VISION.,"Then sought green salads, which they bade them eat,"
12758,A VISION.,A sovereign remedy for inward heat.
12759,A VISION.,
12760,A VISION.,"The Lady of the Leaf ordain'd a feast,"
12761,A VISION.,And made the Lady of the Flower her guest:
12762,A VISION.,"When, lo! a bower ascended on the plain,"
12763,A VISION.,"With sudden seats ordain'd, and large for either train."
12764,A VISION.,"This bower was near my pleasant arbour placed,"
12765,A VISION.,That I could hear and see whatever pass'd:
12766,A VISION.,"The ladies sat with each a knight between,"
12767,A VISION.,"Distinguish'd by their colours, white and green;                   430"
12768,A VISION.,"The vanquish'd party with the victors join'd,"
12769,A VISION.,"Nor wanted sweet discourse, the banquet of the mind."
12770,A VISION.,"Meantime the minstrels play'd on either side,"
12771,A VISION.,"Vain of their art, and for the mastery vied:"
12772,A VISION.,"The sweet contention lasted for an hour,"
12773,A VISION.,And reach'd my secret arbour from the bower.
12774,A VISION.,
12775,A VISION.,"The sun was set; and Vesper, to supply"
12776,A VISION.,"His absent beams, had lighted up the sky."
12777,A VISION.,"When Philomel, officious all the day"
12778,A VISION.,"To sing the service of the ensuing May,                            440"
12779,A VISION.,"Fled from her laurel shade, and wing'd her flight"
12780,A VISION.,Directly to the queen array'd in white:
12781,A VISION.,"And, hopping, sat familiar on her hand,"
12782,A VISION.,"A new musician, and increased the band."
12783,A VISION.,
12784,A VISION.,"The goldfinch, who, to shun the scalding heat,"
12785,A VISION.,"Had changed the medlar for a safer seat,"
12786,A VISION.,"And hid in bushes 'scaped the bitter shower,"
12787,A VISION.,Now perch'd upon the Lady of the Flower;
12788,A VISION.,"And either songster holding out their throats,"
12789,A VISION.,"And folding up their wings, renew'd their notes:                   450"
12790,A VISION.,"As if all day, precluding to the fight,"
12791,A VISION.,"They only had rehearsed, to sing by night."
12792,A VISION.,"The banquet ended, and the battle done,"
12793,A VISION.,They danced by star-light and the friendly moon:
12794,A VISION.,"And when they were to part, the laureate queen"
12795,A VISION.,"Supplied with steeds the lady of the green,"
12796,A VISION.,"Her and her train conducting on the way,"
12797,A VISION.,"The moon to follow, and avoid the day."
12798,A VISION.,
12799,A VISION.,"This when I saw, inquisitive to know"
12800,A VISION.,"The secret moral of the mystic show,                               460"
12801,A VISION.,"I started from my shade, in hopes to find"
12802,A VISION.,Some nymph to satisfy my longing mind:
12803,A VISION.,"And as my fair adventure fell, I found"
12804,A VISION.,"A lady all in white, with laurel crown'd,"
12805,A VISION.,"Who closed the rear, and softly paced along,"
12806,A VISION.,Repeating to herself the former song.
12807,A VISION.,"With due respect my body I inclined,"
12808,A VISION.,"As to some being of superior kind,"
12809,A VISION.,"And made my court according to the day,"
12810,A VISION.,Wishing her queen and her a happy May.                             470
12811,A VISION.,"Great thanks, my daughter, with a gracious bow,"
12812,A VISION.,"She said; and I, who much desired to know"
12813,A VISION.,"Of whence she was, yet fearful how to break"
12814,A VISION.,"My mind, adventured humbly thus to speak:"
12815,A VISION.,"Madam, might I presume and not offend,"
12816,A VISION.,So may the stars and shining moon attend
12817,A VISION.,"Your nightly sports, as you vouchsafe to tell,"
12818,A VISION.,"What nymphs they were who mortal forms excel,"
12819,A VISION.,And what the knights who fought in listed fields so well.
12820,A VISION.,"To this the dame replied: Fair daughter, know,                     480"
12821,A VISION.,That what you saw was all a fairy show;
12822,A VISION.,"And all those airy shapes you now behold,"
12823,A VISION.,"Were human bodies once, and clothed with earthly mould;"
12824,A VISION.,"Our souls, not yet prepared for upper light,"
12825,A VISION.,Till doomsday wander in the shades of night;
12826,A VISION.,"This only holiday of all the year,"
12827,A VISION.,We privileged in sunshine may appear:
12828,A VISION.,"With songs and dance we celebrate the day,"
12829,A VISION.,And with due honours usher in the May.
12830,A VISION.,"At other times we reign by night alone,                            490"
12831,A VISION.,And posting through the skies pursue the moon;
12832,A VISION.,"But when the morn arises, none are found;"
12833,A VISION.,"For cruel Demogorgon walks the round,"
12834,A VISION.,"And if he finds a fairy lag in light,"
12835,A VISION.,"He drives the wretch before, and lashes into night."
12836,A VISION.,
12837,A VISION.,All courteous are by kind; and ever proud
12838,A VISION.,With friendly offices to help the good.
12839,A VISION.,In every land we have a larger space
12840,A VISION.,Than what is known to you of mortal race;
12841,A VISION.,"Where we with green adorn our fairy bowers,                        500"
12842,A VISION.,"And even this grove, unseen before, is ours."
12843,A VISION.,"Know farther; every lady clothed in white,"
12844,A VISION.,"And, crown'd with oak and laurel every knight,"
12845,A VISION.,"Are servants to the Leaf, by liveries known"
12846,A VISION.,Of innocence; and I myself am one.
12847,A VISION.,"Saw you not her, so graceful to behold,"
12848,A VISION.,"In white attire, and crown'd with radiant gold?"
12849,A VISION.,"The sovereign lady of our land is she,"
12850,A VISION.,"Diana call'd, the Queen of Chastity:"
12851,A VISION.,"And, for the spotless name of maid she bears,                      510"
12852,A VISION.,That Agnus castus in her hand appears;
12853,A VISION.,"And all her train, with leafy chaplets crown'd,"
12854,A VISION.,Were for unblamed virginity renown'd;
12855,A VISION.,But those the chief and highest in command
12856,A VISION.,Who bear those holy branches in their hand:
12857,A VISION.,"The knights adorn'd with laurel crowns are they,"
12858,A VISION.,"Whom death nor danger ever could dismay,"
12859,A VISION.,"Victorious names, who made the world obey;"
12860,A VISION.,"Who, while they lived, in deeds of arms excell'd,"
12861,A VISION.,And after death for deities were held.                             520
12862,A VISION.,"But those who wear the woodbine on their brow,"
12863,A VISION.,"Were knights of love, who never broke their vow;"
12864,A VISION.,"Firm to their plighted faith, and ever free"
12865,A VISION.,"From fears and fickle chance, and jealousy."
12866,A VISION.,"The lords and ladies, who the woodbine bear,"
12867,A VISION.,As true as Tristram and Isotta were.
12868,A VISION.,
12869,A VISION.,"But what are those, said I, the unconquer'd nine,"
12870,A VISION.,"Who, crown'd with laurel-wreaths, in golden armour shine?"
12871,A VISION.,"And who the knights in green, and what the train"
12872,A VISION.,Of ladies dress'd with daisies on the plain?                       530
12873,A VISION.,"Why both the bands in worship disagree,"
12874,A VISION.,"And some adore the flower, and some the tree?"
12875,A VISION.,
12876,A VISION.,"Just is your suit, fair daughter, said the dame:"
12877,A VISION.,Those laurell'd chiefs were men of mighty fame;
12878,A VISION.,"Nine worthies were they call'd of different rites,"
12879,A VISION.,"Three Jews, three Pagans, and three Christian knights."
12880,A VISION.,"These, as you see, ride foremost in the field,"
12881,A VISION.,"As they the foremost rank of honour held,"
12882,A VISION.,And all in deeds of chivalry excell'd:
12883,A VISION.,"Their temples wreathed with leaves, that still renew;              540"
12884,A VISION.,For deathless laurel is the victor's due:
12885,A VISION.,"Who bear the bows were knights in Arthur's reign,"
12886,A VISION.,"Twelve they, and twelve the peers of Charlemagne:"
12887,A VISION.,"For bows the strength of brawny arms imply,"
12888,A VISION.,"Emblems of valour, and of victory."
12889,A VISION.,"Behold an order yet of newer date,"
12890,A VISION.,"Doubling their number, equal in their state;"
12891,A VISION.,"Our England's ornament, the crown's defence,"
12892,A VISION.,"In battle brave, protectors of their prince;"
12893,A VISION.,"Unchanged by fortune, to their sovereign true,                     550"
12894,A VISION.,For which their manly legs are bound with blue.
12895,A VISION.,"These, of the Garter call'd, of faith unstain'd,"
12896,A VISION.,"In fighting fields the laurel have obtain'd,"
12897,A VISION.,And well repaid the honours which they gain'd.
12898,A VISION.,"The laurel wreaths were first by Cesar worn,"
12899,A VISION.,And still they Cesar's successors adorn:
12900,A VISION.,"One leaf of this is immortality,"
12901,A VISION.,And more of worth than all the world can buy.
12902,A VISION.,
12903,A VISION.,"One doubt remains, said I, the dames in green,"
12904,A VISION.,"What were their qualities, and who their queen?                    560"
12905,A VISION.,"Flora commands, said she, those nymphs and knights,"
12906,A VISION.,Who lived in slothful ease and loose delights;
12907,A VISION.,"Who never acts of honour durst pursue,"
12908,A VISION.,"The men inglorious knights, the ladies all untrue:"
12909,A VISION.,"Who, nursed in idleness, and train'd in courts,"
12910,A VISION.,"Pass'd all their precious hours in plays, and sports,"
12911,A VISION.,"Till death behind came stalking on, unseen,"
12912,A VISION.,And wither'd (like the storm) the freshness of their green.
12913,A VISION.,"These, and their mates, enjoy their present hour,"
12914,A VISION.,And therefore pay their homage to the Flower:                      570
12915,A VISION.,"But knights in knightly deeds should persevere,"
12916,A VISION.,And still continue what at first they were;
12917,A VISION.,"Continue, and proceed in honour's fair career."
12918,A VISION.,"No room for cowardice, or dull delay;"
12919,A VISION.,From good to better they should urge their way.
12920,A VISION.,"For this with golden spurs the chiefs are graced,"
12921,A VISION.,With pointed rowels arm'd to mend their haste;
12922,A VISION.,For this with lasting leaves their brows are bound;
12923,A VISION.,"For laurel is the sign of labour crown'd,"
12924,A VISION.,"Which bears the bitter blast, nor shaken falls to ground:          580"
12925,A VISION.,"From winter winds it suffers no decay,"
12926,A VISION.,"For ever fresh and fair, and every month is May."
12927,A VISION.,"Even when the vital sap retreats below,"
12928,A VISION.,"Even when the hoary head is hid in snow,"
12929,A VISION.,"The life is in the Leaf, and still between"
12930,A VISION.,The fits of falling snow appears the streaky green.
12931,A VISION.,"Not so the Flower, which lasts for little space,"
12932,A VISION.,"A short-lived good, and an uncertain grace;"
12933,A VISION.,"This way, and that, the feeble stem is driven,"
12934,A VISION.,Weak to sustain the storms and injuries of heaven.                 590
12935,A VISION.,"Propp'd by the spring, it lifts aloft the head,"
12936,A VISION.,"But of a sickly beauty, soon to shed;"
12937,A VISION.,"In summer living, and in winter dead."
12938,A VISION.,"For things of tender kind, for pleasure made,"
12939,A VISION.,"Shoot up with swift increase, and sudden are decay'd."
12940,A VISION.,
12941,A VISION.,"With humble words, the wisest I could frame,"
12942,A VISION.,"And proffer'd service, I repaid the dame;"
12943,A VISION.,"That, of her grace, she gave her maid to know"
12944,A VISION.,The secret meaning of this moral show.
12945,A VISION.,"And she, to prove what profit I had made                           600"
12946,A VISION.,"Of mystic truth, in fables first convey'd,"
12947,A VISION.,"Demanded, till the next returning May,"
12948,A VISION.,Whether the Leaf or Flower I would obey?
12949,A VISION.,"I chose the Leaf; she smiled with sober cheer,"
12950,A VISION.,"And wish'd me fair adventure for the year,"
12951,A VISION.,"And gave me charms and sigils, for defence"
12952,A VISION.,Against ill tongues that scandal innocence:
12953,A VISION.,"But I, said she, my fellows must pursue,"
12954,A VISION.,"Already past the plain, and out of view."
12955,A VISION.,
12956,A VISION.,"We parted thus; I homeward sped my way,                          610"
12957,A VISION.,Bewilder'd in the wood till dawn of day;
12958,A VISION.,And met the merry crew who danced about the May.
12959,A VISION.,"Then late refresh'd with sleep, I rose to write"
12960,A VISION.,The visionary vigils of the night.
12961,A VISION.,
12962,A VISION.,"Blush, as thou may'st, my little book, with shame,"
12963,A VISION.,Nor hope with homely verse to purchase fame;
12964,A VISION.,For such thy maker chose; and so design'd
12965,A VISION.,Thy simple style to suit thy lowly kind.
