93,HERO AND LEANDER.,"Two editions of _Hero and Leander_ appeared in 1598. The first edition,"
94,HERO AND LEANDER.,"containing only Marlowe's portion of the poem, is entitled _Hero and"
95,HERO AND LEANDER.,"Leander. By Christopher Marloe. London, Printed by Adam Islip, for"
96,HERO AND LEANDER.,"Edward Blunt._ 1598. 4to. The title-page of the second edition, which"
97,HERO AND LEANDER.,"contains the complete poem, is _Hero and Leander: Begun by Christopher"

102,HERO AND LEANDER.,Two copies of the second edition were discovered a few years ago at
103,HERO AND LEANDER.,"Lamport Hall (the seat of Sir Charles Isham, Bart.) by Mr. Charles"
104,HERO AND LEANDER.,Edmonds. The existence of this edition was previously unknown. Later

138,HERO AND LEANDER.,I have not had an opportunity of seeing the 4tos. of 1598 or the 4to. of
139,HERO AND LEANDER.,"1600. For the text of the Isham copy, I am indebted to the _Works of"
140,HERO AND LEANDER.,"George Chapman: Poems and Minor Translations_, 1875. I have examined the"
141,HERO AND LEANDER.,"texts of eds. 1606, 1613, 1629, 1637; and my friend Mr. C. H. Firth has"
142,HERO AND LEANDER.,"examined for me the Bodleian copy of ed. 1600, in the margin of which"
143,HERO AND LEANDER.,Malone has noted the readings of the first edition.

155,KNIGHT.,"Sir, we think not ourselves discharged of the duty we owe to our friend"
156,KNIGHT.,when we have brought the breathless body to the earth; for albeit the
157,KNIGHT.,"eye there taketh his ever-farewell of that beloved object, yet the"
158,KNIGHT.,"impression of the man that hath been dear unto us, living an after-life"
159,KNIGHT.,"in our memory, there putteth us in mind of farther obsequies due unto"
160,KNIGHT.,the deceased; and namely of the performance of whatsoever we may judge
161,KNIGHT.,shall make to his living credit and to the effecting of his
162,KNIGHT.,determinations prevented by the stroke of death. By these meditations
163,KNIGHT.,(as by an intellectual will) I suppose myself executor to the unhappily
164,KNIGHT.,deceased author of this poem; upon whom knowing that in his lifetime you
165,KNIGHT.,"bestowed many kind favours, entertaining parts of reckoning and worth"
166,KNIGHT.,"which you found in him with good countenance and liberal affection, I"
167,KNIGHT.,"cannot but see so far into the will of him dead, that whatsoever issue"
168,KNIGHT.,"of his brain should chance to come abroad, that the first breath it"
169,KNIGHT.,"should take might be the gentle air of your liking; for, since his self"
170,KNIGHT.,"had been accustomed thereunto, it would prove more agreeable and"
171,KNIGHT.,thriving to his right children than any other foster countenance
172,KNIGHT.,whatsoever. At this time seeing that this unfinished tragedy happens
173,KNIGHT.,"under my hands to be imprinted; of a double duty, the one to yourself,"
174,KNIGHT.,"the other to the deceased, I present the same to your most favourable"
175,KNIGHT.,"allowance, offering my utmost self now and ever to be ready at your"
176,KNIGHT.,worship's disposing:

208,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The outside of her garments were of lawn,"
209,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;                    10"
210,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,"
211,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Where Venus in her naked glory strove
212,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,To please the careless and disdainful eyes
213,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;"
214,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,"
215,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.
216,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Upon her head she ware[3] a myrtle wreath,"
217,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath:
218,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,"
219,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives:                    20
220,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,"
221,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;
222,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,"
223,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And, beat from thence, have lighted there again."
224,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,"
225,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Which, lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone."
226,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind
227,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind."
228,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight"
229,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"To play upon those hands, they were so white.                     30"
230,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, usËd she,"
231,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;
232,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Where sparrows perch'd of hollow pearl and gold,"
233,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Such as the world would wonder to behold:
234,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,"
235,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Which as she went, would cherup through the bills."
236,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,"
237,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And, looking in her face, was strooken blind."
238,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"But this is true; so like was one the other,"
239,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;                               40
240,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,"
241,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,"
242,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And laid his childish head upon her breast,"
243,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And, with still panting rock,[4] there took his rest."
244,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,"
245,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,"
246,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Because she took more from her than she left,"
247,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:
248,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,"
249,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.                 50
250,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Amorous Leander, beautiful and young"
251,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"(Whose tragedy divine MusÊus sung),"
252,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none
253,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,For whom succeeding times make[5] greater moan.
254,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,"
255,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,"
256,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Would have allur'd the venturous youth of Greece
257,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,To hazard more than for the golden fleece.
258,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Fair Cynthia wished his arms might be her Sphere;
259,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.                60"
260,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,His body was as straight as Circe's wand;
261,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.
262,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Even as delicious meat is to the tast,"
263,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"So was his neck in touching, and surpast"
264,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,"
265,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;"
266,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And whose immortal fingers did imprint
267,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,That heavenly path with many a curious dint
268,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,That runs along his back; but my rude pen
269,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,                         70"
270,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice
271,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;
272,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his"
273,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,That leapt into the water for a kiss
274,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,"
275,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.
276,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,"
277,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Enamour'd of his beauty had he been:
278,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,"
279,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;                         80
280,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,"
281,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought."
282,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,"
283,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"For in his looks were all that men desire,--"
284,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"A pleasant-smiling cheek, a speaking eye,"
285,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,A brow for love to banquet royally;
286,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And such as knew he was a man, would say,"
287,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"""Leander, thou art made for amorous play:"
288,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Why art thou not in love, and loved of all?"
289,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.""                90"
290,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The men of wealthy Sestos every year,"
291,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,"
292,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Rose-cheek'd[6] Adonis, kept a solemn feast:"
293,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Thither resorted many a wandering guest
294,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,To meet their loves: such as had none at all
295,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Came lovers home from this great festival;
296,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"For every street, like to a firmament,"
297,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,"
298,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd"
299,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd,                        100"
300,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,As if another PhaÎton had got
301,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.
302,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"But, far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,"
303,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;
304,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,"
305,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,So was her beauty to the standers by;
306,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery[7] star"
307,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,(When yawning dragons draw her thirling[8] car
308,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,"
309,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,                   110"
310,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood
311,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.
312,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,"
313,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,"
314,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain"
315,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,"
316,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,"
317,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her:
318,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,"
319,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,                      120"
320,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,"
321,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,"
322,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;
323,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,He whom she favours lives; the other dies:
324,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,There might you see one sigh; another rage;
325,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And some, their violent passions to assuage,"
326,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late!"
327,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,For faithful love will never turn to hate;
328,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And many, seeing great princes were denied,"
329,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her died.                    130"
330,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,On this feast-day--O cursËd day and hour!--
331,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower"
332,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,"
333,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy."
334,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,So fair a church as this had Venus none:
335,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The walls were of discolour'd[9] jasper-stone,"
336,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head
337,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,"
338,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,"
339,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.                   140
340,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;
341,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:
342,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"There might you see the gods, in sundry shapes,"
343,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Committing heady riots, incests, rapes;"
344,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"For know, that underneath this radiant flour[10]"
345,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Was Dan‰e's statue in a brazen tower:
346,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Jove slily stealing from his sister's bed,"
347,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"To dally with Idalian Ganymed,"
348,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,"
349,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And tumbling with the Rainbow in a cloud;                        150
350,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net
351,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;
352,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy;"
353,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Silvanus weeping for the lovely boy
354,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"That now is turned into a cypress-tree,"
355,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.
356,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And in the midst a silver altar stood:
357,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,"
358,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Vailed[11] to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;"
359,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And modestly they opened as she rose:                            160
360,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;
361,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And thus Leander was enamourËd.
362,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gaz'd,"
363,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Till with the fire, that from his countenance blaz'd,"
364,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:
365,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.
366,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"It lies not in our power to love or hate,"
367,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.
368,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"When two are stript long ere the course begin,"
369,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"We wish that one should lose, the other win;                     170"
370,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And one especially do we affect
371,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:"
372,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,"
373,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
374,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:"
375,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?[12]"
376,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,He kneel'd; but unto her devoutly prayed:
377,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said,"
378,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"""Were I the saint he worships, I would hear him;"""
379,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And, as she spake those words, came somewhat near him.           180"
380,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,He started up; she blushed as one asham'd;
381,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Wherewith Leander much more was inflam'd.
382,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,He touch'd her hand; in touching it she trembled:
383,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Love deeply grounded hardly is dissembled.
384,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,These lovers parled by the touch of hands:
385,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"True love is mute, and oft amazËd stands."
386,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled,"
387,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,The air with sparks of living fire was spangled;
388,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And night,[13] deep-drenched in misty Acheron,"
389,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Heav'd up her head, and half the world upon                      190"
390,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Breath'd darkness forth (dark night is Cupid's day):
391,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And now begins Leander to display
392,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Love's holy fire, with words, with sighs, and tears;"
393,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Which, like sweet music, enter'd Hero's ears;"
394,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And yet at every word she turn'd aside
395,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And always cut him off, as he replied."
396,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"At last, like to a bold sharp sophister,"
397,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,With cheerful hope thus he accosted her.
398,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"""Fair creature,[14] let me speak without offence:"
399,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,I would my rude words had the influence                          200
400,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,To lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine!
401,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Then shouldst thou be his prisoner, who is thine."
402,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Be not unkind and fair; mis-shapen stuff
403,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Are of behaviour boisterous and rough.
404,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"O, shun me not, but hear me ere you go!"
405,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"God knows, I cannot force love as you do:"
406,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"My words shall be as spotless as my youth,"
407,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Full of simplicity and naked truth.
408,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"This sacrifice, whose sweet perfume descending"
409,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"From Venus' altar, to your footsteps bending,                    210"
410,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Doth testify that you exceed her far,"
411,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"To whom you offer, and whose nun you are."
412,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Why should you worship her? her you surpass
413,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,As much as sparkling diamonds flaring glass.
414,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,A diamond set in lead his worth retains;
415,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"A heavenly nymph, belov'd of human swains,"
416,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Receives no blemish, but ofttimes more grace;"
417,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Which makes me hope, although I am but base,"
418,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Base in respect of thee divine and pure,"
419,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Dutiful service may thy love procure;                            220
420,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And I in duty will excel all other,"
421,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,As thou in beauty dost exceed Love's mother.
422,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Nor heaven nor thou were made to gaze upon:
423,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"As heaven preserves all things, so save thou one."
424,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"A stately-builded ship, well rigg'd and tall,"
425,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,The ocean maketh more majestical;
426,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Why vow'st thou, then, to live in Sestos here,"
427,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Who on Love's seas more glorious wouldst appear?
428,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Like untun'd golden strings all women are,"
429,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Which long time lie untouch'd, will harshly jar.                 230"
430,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Vessels of brass, oft handled, brightly shine:"
431,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,What diffËrence betwixt[15] the richest mine
432,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And basest mould, but use? for both, not us'd,"
433,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Are of like worth. Then treasure is abus'd,"
434,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"When misers keep it: being put to loan,"
435,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,In time it will return us two for one.
436,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Rich robes themselves and others do adorn;
437,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Neither themselves nor others, if not worn."
438,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Who builds a palace, and rams up the gate,"
439,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Shall see it ruinous and desolate:                               240
440,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Ah, simple Hero, learn thyself to cherish!"
441,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Lone women, like to empty houses, perish."
442,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Less sins the poor rich man, that starves himself"
443,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"In heaping up a mass of drossy pelf,"
444,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Than such as you: his golden earth remains,"
445,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Which, after his decease some other gains;"
446,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"But this fair gem, sweet in the loss alone,"
447,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"When you fleet hence, can be bequeath'd to none;"
448,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Or, if it could, down from th' enamell'd sky"
449,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"All heaven would come to claim this legacy,                      250"
450,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And with intestine broils the world destroy,"
451,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And quite confound Nature's sweet harmony.
452,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Well therefore by the gods decreed it is,"
453,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,We human creatures should enjoy that bliss.
454,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"One is no number;[16] maids are nothing, then,"
455,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Without the sweet society of men.
456,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Wilt thou live single still? one shalt thou be,"
457,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Though never-singling Hymen couple thee.
458,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Wild savages, that drink of running springs"
459,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Think water far excels all earthly things;                       260
460,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"But they, that daily taste neat[17] wine, despise it:"
461,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Virginity, albeit some highly prize it,"
462,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Compar'd with marriage, had you tried them both,"
463,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Differs as much as wine and water doth.
464,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Base bullion for the stamp's sake we allow:
465,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Even so for men's impression do we you;
466,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"By which alone, our reverend fathers say,"
467,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Women receive perfection every way.
468,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"This idol, which you term virginity,"
469,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Is neither essence subject to the eye,                           270"
470,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"No, nor to any one exterior sense,"
471,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Nor hath it any place of residence,"
472,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Nor is't of earth or mould celestial,"
473,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Or capable of any form at all.
474,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Of that which hath no being, do not boast;"
475,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Things that are not at all, are never lost."
476,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Men foolishly do call it virtuous:
477,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"What virtue is it, that is born with us?"
478,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Much less can honour be ascrib'd thereto:
479,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Honour is purchas'd by the deeds we do;                          280
480,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Believe me, Hero, honour is not won,"
481,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Until some honourable deed be done.
482,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Seek you, for chastity, immortal fame,"
483,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And know that some have wrong'd Diana's name?
484,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Whose name is it, if she be false or not,"
485,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"So she be fair, but some vile tongues will blot?"
486,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"But you are fair, ay me! so wondrous fair,"
487,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"So young, so gentle, and so debonair."
488,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"As Greece will think, if thus you live alone,"
489,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Some one or other keeps you as his own.                          290
490,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Then, Hero, hate me not, nor from me fly,"
491,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,To follow swiftly-blasting infamy.
492,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Perhaps thy sacred priesthood makes thee loath:
493,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Tell me to whom mad'st thou that heedless oath?"""
494,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"""To Venus,"" answer'd she; and, as she spake,"
495,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Forth from those two tralucent cisterns brake
496,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"A stream of liquid pearl, which down her face"
497,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Made milk-white paths, whereon the gods might trace"
498,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"To Jove's high court. He thus replied: ""The rites"
499,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"In which Love's beauteous empress most delights,                 300"
500,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Are banquets, Doric music, midnight revel,"
501,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Plays, masks, and all that stern age counteth evil."
502,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Thee as a holy idiot doth she scorn;
503,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"For thou, in vowing chastity, hast sworn"
504,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"To rob her name and honour, and thereby"
505,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Committ'st a sin far worse than perjury,"
506,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Even sacrilege against her deity,"
507,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Through regular and formal purity.
508,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"To expiate which sin, kiss and shake hands:"
509,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Such sacrifice as this Venus demands.""                           310"
510,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Thereat she smil'd, and did deny him so,"
511,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"As put[18] thereby, yet might he hope for mo;"
512,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Which makes him quickly reinforce his speech,"
513,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And her in humble manner thus beseech:
514,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"""Though neither gods nor men may thee deserve,"
515,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Yet for her sake, whom you have vow'd to serve,"
516,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Abandon fruitless cold virginity,"
517,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,The gentle queen of Love's sole enemy.
518,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Then shall you most resemble Venus' nun,"
519,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,When Venus' sweet rites are performed and done.                  320
520,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Flint-breasted Pallas joys in single life;
521,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,But Pallas and your mistress are at strife.
522,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Love, Hero, then, and be not tyrannous;"
523,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,But heal the heart that thou hast wounded thus;
524,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Nor stain thy youthful years with avarice:
525,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Fair fools delight to be accounted nice.
526,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The richest[19] corn dies, if it be not reapt;"
527,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Beauty alone is lost, too warily kept."""
528,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"These arguments he us'd, and many more;"
529,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Wherewith she yielded, that was won before.                      330"
530,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Hero's looks yielded, but her words made war:"
531,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Women are won when they begin to jar.
532,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Thus, having swallow'd Cupid's golden hook,"
533,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The more she striv'd, the deeper was she strook:"
534,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Yet, evilly feigning anger, strove she still,"
535,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And would be thought to grant against her will.
536,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"So having paus'd a while, at last she said,"
537,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"""Who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid?"
538,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Ay me! such words as these should I abhor,"
539,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And yet I like them for the orator.""                             340"
540,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"With that, Leander stooped to have embrac'd her,"
541,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"But from his spreading arms away she cast her,"
542,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And thus bespake him: ""Gentle youth, forbear"
543,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,To touch the sacred garments which I wear.
544,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Upon a rock, and underneath a hill,"
545,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Far from the town (where all is whist[20] and still,"
546,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Save that the sea, playing on yellow sand,"
547,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Sends forth a rattling murmur to the land,"
548,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Whose sound allures the golden Morpheus
549,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"In silence of the night to visit us),                            350"
550,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"My turret stands; and there, God knows, I play"
551,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,With Venus' swans and sparrows all the day.
552,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"A[21] dwarfish beldam bears me company,"
553,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"That hops about the chamber where I lie,"
554,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And spends the night, that might be better spent,"
555,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,In vain discourse and apish merriment:--
556,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Come thither."" As she spake this, her tongue tripp'd,"
557,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"For unawares ""Come thither"" from her slipp'd;"
558,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And suddenly her former colour chang'd,"
559,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And here and there her eyes through anger rang'd;                360
560,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And, like a planet moving several ways"
561,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"At one self instant, she, poor soul, assays,"
562,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Loving, not to love at all, and every part"
563,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Strove to resist the motions of her heart:
564,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And hands so pure, so innocent, nay, such"
565,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"As might have made Heaven stoop to have a touch,"
566,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Did she uphold to Venus, and again"
567,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Vow'd spotless chastity; but all in vain;
568,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Cupid beats down her prayers with his wings;
569,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Her vows above[22] the empty air he flings:                      370
570,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"All deep enrag'd, his sinewy bow he bent,"
571,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And shot a shaft that burning from him went;
572,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Wherewith she strooken, look'd so dolefully,"
573,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,As made Love sigh to see his tyranny;
574,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And, as she wept, her tears to pearl he turn'd,"
575,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And wound them on his arm, and for her mourn'd."
576,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Then towards the palace of the Destinies,"
577,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Laden with languishment and grief, he flies,"
578,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And to those stern nymphs humbly made request,"
579,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Both might enjoy each other, and be blest.                       380"
580,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"But with a ghastly dreadful countenance,"
581,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Threatening a thousand deaths at every glance,"
582,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"They answer'd Love, nor would vouchsafe so much"
583,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"As one poor word, their hate to him was such:"
584,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Hearken awhile, and I will tell you why."
585,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Heaven's wingËd herald, Jove-born Mercury,"
586,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,The self-same day that he asleep had laid
587,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Enchanted Argus, spied a country maid,"
588,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Whose careless hair, instead of pearl t'adorn it,"
589,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Glister'd with dew, as one that seemed to scorn it;              390"
590,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Her breath as fragrant as the morning rose;
591,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Her mind pure, and her tongue untaught to glose:"
592,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,Yet proud she was (for lofty Pride that dwells
593,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"In tower'd courts, is oft in shepherds' cells),"
594,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And too-too well the fair vermillion knew
595,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,And silver tincture of her cheeks that drew
596,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,The love of every swain. On her this god
597,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Enamour'd was, and with his snaky rod"
598,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"Did charm her nimble feet, and made her stay,"
599,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"The while upon a hillock down he lay,                            400"
600,THE FIRST SESTIAD.,"And sweetly on his pipe began to play,"

892,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,When first religious chastity she vowed;                         110
893,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Which made his love through Sestos to be known,"
894,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And thence unto Abydos sooner blown
895,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Than he could sail; for incorporeal Fame,"
896,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Whose weight consists in nothing but her name,"
897,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Is swifter than the wind, whose tardy plumes"

904,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"He would have chas'd away the swelling main,"
905,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,That him from her unjustly did detain.

912,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Therefore even as an index to a book,"
913,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,So to his mind was young Leander's look.                         130
914,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"O, none but gods have power[31] their love to hide!"
915,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Affection by the countenance is descried;
916,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The light of hidden fire itself discovers,"
917,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And love that is concealed betrays poor lovers.
918,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,His secret flame apparently was seen:
919,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Leander's father knew where he had been,"
920,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And for the same mildly rebuk'd his son,"
921,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Thinking to quench the sparkles new-begun.
922,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"But love, resisted once, grows passionate,"
923,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And nothing more than counsel lovers hate;                       140
924,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,For as a hot proud horse highly disdains
925,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"To have his head controlled, but breaks the reins,"

927,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Checks the submissive ground; so he that loves,"
928,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The more he is restrain'd, the worse he fares:"
929,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,What is it now but mad Leander dares?
930,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"""O Hero, Hero!"" thus he cried full oft;"

932,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Where having spied her tower, long star'd he on't,"
933,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And pray'd the narrow toiling Hellespont                         150
934,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"To part in twain, that he might come and go;"
935,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"But still the rising billows answer'd, ""No."""
936,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"With that, he stripp'd him to the ivory skin,"
937,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And, crying, ""Love, I come,"" leap'd lively in:"
938,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Whereat the sapphire-visaged god grew proud,"
939,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And made his capering Triton sound aloud,"
940,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Imagining that Ganymede, displeas'd,"

942,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Leander strived; the waves about him wound,"
943,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And pull'd him to the bottom, where the ground                   160"
944,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Was strewed with pearl, and in low coral groves"
945,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Sweet-singing mermaids sported with their loves
946,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"On heaps of heavy gold, and took great pleasure"

950,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The lusty god embrac'd him, called him ""Love,"""
951,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And swore he never should return to Jove:
952,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"But when he knew it was not Ganymed,"
953,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"For under water he was almost dead,                              170"
954,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"He heav'd him up, and, looking on his face,"
955,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Beat down the bold waves with his triple mace,"
956,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Which mounted up, intending to have kiss'd him,"
957,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And fell in drops like tears because they miss'd him.
958,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Leander, being up, began to swim,"
959,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And, looking back, saw Neptune follow him:"
960,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Whereat aghast, the poor soul gan to cry,"
961,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"""O, let me visit Hero ere I die!"""
962,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The god put Helle's bracelet on his arm,"

964,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"He clapped his plump cheeks, with his tresses played,"
965,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And, smiling wantonly, his love bewrayed;"

967,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"At every stroke, betwixt them would he slide,"
968,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And steal a kiss, and then run out and dance,"
969,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And, as he turn'd, cast many a lustful glance,"

974,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And talk of love. Leander made reply,"
975,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"""You are deceiv'd; I am no woman, I."""
976,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Thereat smil'd Neptune, and then told a tale,"

979,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,As for his love both earth and heaven pin'd;
980,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"That of the cooling river durst not drink,"

989,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And, as he spake, upon the waves he springs."
990,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Neptune was angry that he gave no ear,"
991,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And in his heart revenging malice bare:
992,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"He flung at him his mace; but, as it went,"
993,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"He call'd it in, for love made him repent:                       210"
994,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The mace, returning back, his own hand hit,"
995,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,As meaning to be venged for darting it.
996,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"When this fresh-bleeding wound Leander viewed,"
997,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"His colour went and came, as if he rued"
998,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,The grief which Neptune felt: in gentle breasts
999,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Relenting thoughts, remorse, and pity rests;"
1000,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And who have hard hearts and obdurate minds,"
1001,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"But vicious, hare-brained, and illiterate hinds?"
1002,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The god, seeing him with pity to be moved,"
1003,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Thereon concluded that he was beloved.                           220
1004,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"(Love is too full of faith, too credulous,"
1005,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,With folly and false hope deluding us);

1008,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Tis wisdom to give much; a gift prevails

1012,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Breathless albeit he were, he rested not"
1013,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Till to the solitary tower he got;                               230
1014,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And knocked and called: at which celestial noise
1015,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The longing heart of Hero much more joys,"
1016,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings,"
1017,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Or crookËd dolphin when the sailor sings.

1026,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"The nearer that he came, the more she fled,"
1027,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And, seeking refuge, slipt into her bed;"

1044,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Like chaste Diana when ActÊon spied her,"
1045,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Being suddenly betray'd, div'd down to hide her;"
1046,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And, as her silver body downward went,"
1047,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"With both her hands she made the bed a tent,"
1048,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And in her own mind thought herself secure,"
1049,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,O'ercast with dim and darksome coverture.
1050,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And now she lets him whisper in her ear,"

1052,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Yet ever, as he greedily assay'd"

1060,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Yet there with Sisyphus he toil'd in vain,"
1061,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,Till gentle parley did the truce obtain
1062,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Even[37] as a bird, which in our hands we wring,"
1063,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Forth plungeth, and oft flutters with her wing,                  280"

1069,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,In such wars women use but half their strength.
1070,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Leander now, like Theban Hercules,"

1077,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Enclos'd her in his arms, and kiss'd her too:"
1078,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"And every kiss to her was as a charm,"
1079,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And to Leander as a fresh alarm:
1080,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"So that the truce was broke, and she, alas,"
1081,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Poor silly maiden, at his mercy was."
1082,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,"Love is not full of pity, as men say,"

1085,THE SECOND SESTIAD.,And sigh'd to think upon th' approaching sun;

1416,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,"Not being with civil forms confirm'd and bounded,"
1417,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,For human dignities and comforts founded;

1422,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,"In which, with plain neglect of nuptial rites,"
1423,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,He close and flatly fell to his delights:
1424,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,And instantly he vow'd to celebrate
1425,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,All rites pertaining to his married state.                       160
1426,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,"So up he gets, and to his father goes,"
1427,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,To whose glad ears he doth his vows disclose.

1443,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,"Which ever since a red morn doth foretell,"
1444,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,And still renews our woes for Hero's woe;
1445,THE THIRD SESTIAD.,And foul it prov'd because it figur'd so                         180

1847,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,For in that sea she naked figured him;
1848,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Her diving needle taught him how to swim,"
1849,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And to each thread did such resemblance give,"
1850,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,For joy to be so like him it did live:
1851,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Things senseless live by art, and rational die"
1852,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,By rude contempt of art and industry.
1853,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Scarce could she work, but, in her strength of thought,"
1854,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"She fear'd she prick'd Leander as she wrought,[71]"
1855,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And oft would shriek so, that her guardian, frighted,             60"
1856,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Would startling haste, as with some mischief cited:"
1857,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,They double life that dead things' griefs sustain;
1858,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,They kill that feel not their friends' living pain.
1859,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Sometimes she fear'd he sought her infamy;
1860,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And then, as she was working of his eye,"
1861,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,She thought to prick it out to quench her ill;
1862,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"But, as she prick'd, it grew more perfect still:"
1863,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Trifling attempts no serious acts advance;
1864,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,The fire of love is blown by dalliance.
1865,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"In working his fair neck she did so grace it,                     70"
1866,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,She still was working her own arms t' embrace it:
1867,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"That, and his shoulders, and his hands were seen"
1868,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Above the stream; and with a pure sea-green
1869,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"She did so quaintly shadow every limb,"
1870,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,All might be seen beneath the waves to swim.
1871,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,In this conceited scarf she wrought beside
1872,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"A moon in change, and shooting stars did glide"
1873,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,In number after her with bloody beams;
1874,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Which figur'd her affects[72] in their extremes,"
1875,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Pursuing nature in her Cynthian body,                             80"
1876,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And did her thoughts running on change imply;
1877,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"For maids take more delight, when they prepare,"
1878,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And think of wives' states, than when wives they are."
1879,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Beneath all these she wrought a fisherman,[73]"
1880,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Drawing his nets from forth the ocean;
1881,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Who drew so hard, ye might discover well"
1882,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,The toughen'd sinews in his neck did swell:
1883,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"His inward strains drave out his blood-shot eyes,"
1884,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And springs of sweat did in his forehead rise;
1885,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Yet was of naught but of a serpent sped,                          90"
1886,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That in his bosom flew and stung him dead:
1887,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And this by Fate into her mind was sent,"
1888,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Not wrought by mere instinct of her intent.
1889,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"At the scarf's other end her hand did frame,"
1890,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Near the fork'd point of the divided flame,"
1891,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"A country virgin keeping of a vine,"
1892,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Who did of hollow bulrushes combine
1893,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Snares for the stubble-loving grasshopper,"
1894,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And by her lay her scrip that nourish'd her.
1895,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Within a myrtle shade she sate and sung;                         100
1896,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And tufts of waving reeds above her sprung,"
1897,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Where lurked two foxes, that, while she applied"
1898,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Her trifling snares, their thieveries did divide,"
1899,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"One to the vine, another to her scrip,"
1900,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That she did negligently overslip;
1901,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,By which her fruitful vine and wholesome fare
1902,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,She suffered spoiled to make a childish snare.
1903,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"These ominous fancies did her soul express,"
1904,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And every finger made a prophetess,"
1905,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"To show what death was hid in love's disguise,                   110"
1906,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And make her judgment conquer Destinies.
1907,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"O, what sweet forms fair ladies' souls do shroud,"
1908,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Were they made seen and forcËd through their blood;
1909,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"If through their beauties, like rich work through lawn,"
1910,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"They would set forth their minds with virtues drawn,"
1911,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"In letting graces from their fingers fly,"
1912,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,To still their eyas[74] thoughts with industry;
1913,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That their plied wits in numbered silks might sing
1914,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Passion's huge conquest, and their needles[75] leading"
1915,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Affection prisoner through their own-built cities,               120"
1916,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Pinioned with stones and Arachnean ditties.
1917,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Proceed we now with Hero's sacrifice:
1918,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"She odours burned, and from their smoke did rise"
1919,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Unsavoury fumes, that air with plagues inspired;"
1920,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And then the consecrated sticks she fired.
1921,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"On whose pale flames an angry spirit flew,"
1922,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And beat it down still as it upward grew;
1923,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The virgin tapers that on th' altar stood,"
1924,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"When she inflam'd them, burned as red as blood;[76]"
1925,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"All sad ostents of that too near success,[77]                    130"
1926,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That made such moving beauties motionless.
1927,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Then Hero wept; but her affrighted eyes
1928,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"She quickly wrested from the sacrifice,"
1929,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Shut them, and inwards for Leander looked,"
1930,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Search'd her soft bosom, and from thence she plucked"
1931,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"His lovely picture; which when she had viewed,"
1932,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Her beauties were with all love's joys renewed;
1933,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The odours sweeten'd, and the fires burned clear,"
1934,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Leander's form left no ill object there:
1935,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Such was his beauty, that the force of light,                    140"
1936,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Whose knowledge teacheth wonders infinite,"
1937,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The strength of number and proportion,"
1938,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Nature had placed in it to make it known,"
1939,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Art was her daughter, and what human wits"
1940,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"For study lost, entombed in drossy spirits."
1941,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,After this accident (which for her glory
1942,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Hero could not but make a history),"
1943,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Th' inhabitants of Sestos and Abydos
1944,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Did every year, with feasts propitious,"
1945,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,To fair Leander's picture sacrifice:                             150
1946,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And they were persons of especial price
1947,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"That were allowed it, as an ornament"
1948,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"T' enrich their houses, for the continent"
1949,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Of the strange virtues all approved it held;
1950,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,For even the very look of it repelled
1951,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"All blastings, witchcrafts, and the strifes of nature"
1952,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,In those diseases that no herbs could cure;
1953,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The wolfy sting of avarice it would pull,"
1954,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And make the rankest miser bountiful;
1955,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,It kill'd the fear of thunder and of death;                      160
1956,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,The discords that conceit engendereth
1957,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"'Twixt man and wife, it for the time would cease;"
1958,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The flames of love it quench'd, and would increase;"
1959,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Held in a prince's hand, it would put out"
1960,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,The dreadful'st comet; it would ease[78] all doubt
1961,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Of threaten'd mischiefs; it would bring asleep
1962,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Such as were mad; it would enforce to weep
1963,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Most barbarous eyes; and many more effects
1964,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"This picture wrought, and sprung[79] Leandrian[80] sects;"
1965,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Of which was Hero first; for he whose form,                      170"
1966,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Held in her hand, clear'd such a fatal storm,"
1967,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"From hell she thought his person would defend her,"
1968,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Which night and Hellespont would quickly send her.
1969,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"With this confirm'd, she vow'd to banish quite"
1970,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,All thought of any check to her delight;
1971,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And, in contempt of silly bashfulness,"
1972,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"She would the faith of her desires profess,"
1973,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Where her religion should be policy,"
1974,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,To follow love with zeal her piety;
1975,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Her chamber her cathedral-church should be,                      180"
1976,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And her Leander her chief deity;
1977,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,For in her love these did the gods forego;
1978,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And though her knowledge did not teach her so,"
1979,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Yet did it teach her this, that what her heart"
1980,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Did greatest hold in her self-greatest part,"
1981,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That she did make her god; and 'twas less naught
1982,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"To leave gods in profession and in thought,"
1983,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Than in her love and life; for therein lies
1984,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Most of her duties and their dignities;
1985,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And, rail the brain-bald world at what it will,                  190"
1986,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That's the grand atheism that reigns in it still.
1987,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Yet singularity she would use no more,"
1988,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,For she was singular too much before;
1989,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,But she would please the world with fair pretext:
1990,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Love would not leave her conscience perplext:
1991,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Great men that will have less do for them, still"
1992,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Must bear them out, though th' acts be ne'er so ill;"
1993,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Meanness must pander be to Excellence;
1994,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Pleasure atones Falsehood and Conscience:
1995,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Dissembling was the worst, thought Hero then,                    200"
1996,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And that was best, now she must live with men."
1997,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"O virtuous love, that taught her to do best"
1998,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"When she did worst, and when she thought it least!"
1999,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Thus would she still proceed in works divine,"
2000,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And in her sacred state of priesthood shine,"
2001,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Handling the holy rites with hands as bold,"
2002,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"As if therein she did Jove's thunder hold,"
2003,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And need not fear those menaces of error,"
2004,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Which she at others threw with greatest terror.
2005,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"O lovely Hero, nothing is thy sin,                               210"
2006,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Weigh'd with those foul faults other priests are in!
2007,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"That having neither faiths, nor works, nor beauties,"
2008,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"T' engender any 'scuse for slubbered[81] duties,"
2009,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"With as much countenance fill their holy chairs,"
2010,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And sweat denouncements 'gainst profane affairs,"
2011,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"As if their lives were cut out by their places,"
2012,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And they the only fathers of the graces.
2013,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Now, as with settled mind she did repair"
2014,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Her thoughts to sacrifice her ravished hair
2015,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And her torn robe, which on the altar lay,                       220"
2016,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And only for religion's fire did stay,"
2017,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"She heard a thunder by the Cyclops beaten,"
2018,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"In such a volley as the world did threaten,"
2019,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Given Venus as she parted th' airy sphere,"
2020,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Descending now to chide with Hero here:
2021,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"When suddenly the goddess' waggoners,"
2022,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The swans and turtles that, in coupled pheres,[82]"
2023,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Through all worlds' bosoms draw her influence,"
2024,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Lighted in Hero's window, and from thence"
2025,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"To her fair shoulders flew the gentle doves,--                   230"
2026,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Graceful _∆done_[83] that sweet pleasure loves,"
2027,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And ruff-foot Chreste[84] with the tufted crown;
2028,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Both which did kiss her, though their goddess frown."
2029,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The swans did in the solid flood, her glass,"
2030,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Proin[85] their fair plumes; of which the fairest was
2031,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Jove-lov'd Leucote,[86] that pure brightness is;"
2032,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,The other bounty-loving Dapsilis.[87]
2033,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"All were in heaven, now they with Hero were:"
2034,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"But Venus' looks brought wrath, and urgËd fear."
2035,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Her robe was scarlet; black her head's attire:                   240
2036,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And through her naked breast shin'd streams of fire,"
2037,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,As when the rarifiËd air is driven
2038,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"In flashing streams, and opes the darken'd heaven."
2039,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,In her white hand a wreath of yew she bore;
2040,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And, breaking th' icy wreath sweet Hero wore,"
2041,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"She forc'd about her brows her wreath of yew,"
2042,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And said, ""Now, minion, to thy fate be true,"
2043,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Though not to me; endure what this portends:
2044,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Begin where lightness will, in shame it ends."
2045,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Love makes thee cunning; thou art current now,                   250"
2046,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,By being counterfeit: thy broken vow
2047,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Deceit with her pied garters must rejoin,"
2048,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And with her stamp thou countenances must coin;
2049,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Coyness, and pure[88] deceits, for purities,"
2050,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And still a maid wilt seem in cozen'd eyes,"
2051,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And have an antic face to laugh within,"
2052,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,While thy smooth looks make men digest thy sin.
2053,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"But since thy lips (least thought forsworn) forswore,"
2054,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Be never virgin's vow worth trusting more!"""
2055,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,When Beauty's dearest did her goddess hear                     260
2056,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Breathe such rebukes 'gainst that she could not clear,"
2057,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Dumb sorrow spake aloud in tears and blood,"
2058,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"That from her grief-burst veins, in piteous flood,"
2059,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,From the sweet conduits of her favour fell.
2060,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,The gentle turtles did with moans make swell
2061,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Their shining gorges; the while black-ey'd swans
2062,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Did sing as woful epicedians,"
2063,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"As they would straightways die: when Pity's queen,"
2064,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"The goddess Ecte,[89] that had ever been"
2065,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Hid in a watery cloud near Hero's cries,                         270"
2066,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Since the first instant of her broken eyes,"
2067,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Gave bright Leucote voice, and made her speak,"
2068,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"To ease her anguish, whose swoln breast did break"
2069,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"With anger at her goddess, that did touch"
2070,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Hero so near for that she us'd so much;
2071,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And, thrusting her white neck at Venus, said:"
2072,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"""Why may not amorous Hero seem a maid,"
2073,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Though she be none, as well as you suppress"
2074,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,In modest cheeks your inward wantonness?
2075,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"How often have we drawn you from above,                          280"
2076,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,T' exchange with mortals rites for rites in love!
2077,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Why in your priest, then, call you that offence,"
2078,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"That shines in you, and is[90] your influence?"""
2079,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"With this, the Furies stopp'd Leucote's lips,"
2080,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Enjoin'd by Venus; who with rosy whips
2081,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Beat the kind bird. Fierce lightning from her eyes
2082,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Did set on fire fair Hero's sacrifice,"
2083,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Which was her torn robe and enforcËd hair;
2084,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And the bright flame became a maid most fair
2085,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"For her aspËct: her tresses were of wire,                        290"
2086,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Knit like a net, where hearts set all on fire,"
2087,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Struggled in pants, and could not get releast;"
2088,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Her arms were all with golden pincers drest,"
2089,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And twenty-fashioned knots, pulleys, and brakes,"
2090,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,And all her body girt with painted snakes;
2091,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Her down-parts in a scorpion's tail combined,"
2092,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Freckled with twenty colours; pied wings shined
2093,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Out of her shoulders; cloth had never dye,"
2094,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Nor sweeter colours never viewËd eye,"
2095,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"In scorching Turkey, Cares, Tartary,                             300"
2096,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Than shined about this spirit notorious;
2097,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Nor was Arachne's web so glorious.
2098,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Of lightning and of shreds she was begot;
2099,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,More hold in base dissemblers is there not.
2100,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Her name was Eronusis.[91] Venus flew
2101,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"From Hero's sight, and at her chariot drew"
2102,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"This wondrous creature to so steep a height,"
2103,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That all the world she might command with sleight
2104,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Of her gay wings; and then she bade her haste,--"
2105,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Since Hero had dissembled, and disgraced                         310"
2106,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Her rites so much,--and every breast infect"
2107,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,With her deceits: she made her architect
2108,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Of all dissimulation; and since then
2109,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Never was any trust in maids or men.
2110,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"O, it spited"
2111,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Fair Venus' heart to see her most delighted,"
2112,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And one she choos'd, for temper of her mind"
2113,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"To be the only ruler of her kind,"
2114,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,So soon to let her virgin race be ended!
2115,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Not simply for the fault a whit offended,                        320"
2116,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"But that in strife for chasteness with the Moon,"
2117,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Spiteful Diana bade her show but one
2118,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"That was her servant vow'd, and liv'd a maid;"
2119,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And, now she thought to answer that upbraid,"
2120,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Hero had lost her answer: who knows not
2121,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Venus would seem as far from any spot
2122,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Of light demeanour, as the very skin"
2123,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,'Twixt Cynthia's brows? sin is asham'd of sin.
2124,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Up Venus flew, and scarce durst up for fear"
2125,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Of Phoebe's laughter, when she pass'd her sphere:                330"
2126,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And so most ugly-clouded was the light,"
2127,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,That day was hid in day; night came ere night;
2128,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"And Venus could not through the thick air pierce,"
2129,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,"Till the day's king, god of undaunted verse,"
2130,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,Because she was so plentiful a theme
2131,THE FOURTH SESTIAD.,To such as wore his laurel anademe.

2452,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"He fell on Hymen's hand, who straight did spy"
2453,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The bounteous godhead, and with wondrous joy"
2454,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Offer'd it Eucharis. She, wonderous coy,"
2455,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Drew back her hand: the subtle flower did woo it,"
2456,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And, drawing it near, mixed so you could not know it:            220"
2457,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"As two clear tapers mix in one their light,"
2458,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,So did the lily and the hand their white.
2459,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,She viewed it; and her view the form bestows
2460,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Amongst her spirits; for, as colour flows"
2461,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"From superficies of each thing we see,"
2462,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Even so with colours forms emitted be;
2463,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And where Love's form is, Love is; Love is form:"
2464,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,He entered at the eye; his sacred storm
2465,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Rose from the hand, Love's sweetest instrument:"
2466,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"It stirred her blood's sea so, that high it went,                230"
2467,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And beat in bashful waves 'gainst the white shore
2468,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Of her divided cheeks; it raged the more,"
2469,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Because the tide went 'gainst the haughty wind
2470,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Of her estate and birth: and, as we find,"
2471,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"In fainting ebbs, the flowery Zephyr hurls"
2472,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The green-haired Hellespont, broke in silver curls,"
2473,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"'Gainst Hero's tower; but in his blast's retreat,"
2474,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The waves obeying him, they after beat,"
2475,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Leaving the chalky shore a great way pale,"
2476,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Then moist it freshly with another gale;                         240
2477,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"So ebbed and flowed the blood[98] in Eucharis' face,"
2478,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Coyness and Love strived which had greatest grace;
2479,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Virginity did fight on Coyness' side,"
2480,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Fear of her parent's frowns and female pride
2481,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Loathing the lower place, more than it loves"
2482,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,The high contents desert and virtue moves.
2483,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"With Love fought Hymen's beauty and his valure,[99]"
2484,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Which scarce could so much favour yet allure
2485,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"To come to strike, but fameless idle stood:"
2486,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Action is fiery valour's sovereign good.                         250
2487,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"But Love, once entered, wished no greater aid"
2488,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Than he could find within; thought thought betray'd;
2489,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The bribed, but incorrupted, garrison"
2490,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Sung ""Io Hymen;"" there those songs begun,"
2491,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And Love was grown so rich with such a gain,"
2492,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And wanton with the ease of his free reign,"
2493,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,That he would turn into her roughest frowns
2494,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,To turn them out; and thus he Hymen crowns
2495,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"King of his thoughts, man's greatest empery:"
2496,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,This was his first brave step to deity.                          260
2497,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Home to the mourning city they repair,"
2498,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"With news as wholesome as the morning air,"
2499,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,To the sad parents of each savËd maid:
2500,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,But Hymen and his Eucharis had laid
2501,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,This plat[100] to make the flame of their delight
2502,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Round as the moon at full, and full as bright."
2503,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Because the parents of chaste Eucharis
2504,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Exceeding Hymen's so, might cross their bliss;"
2505,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And as the world rewards deserts, that law"
2506,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Cannot assist with force; so when they saw                       270
2507,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Their daughter safe, take vantage of their own,"
2508,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Praise Hymen's valour much, nothing bestown;"
2509,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Hymen must leave the virgins in a grove
2510,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Far off from Athens, and go first to prove,"
2511,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"If to restore them all with fame and life,"
2512,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,He should enjoy his dearest as his wife.
2513,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"This told to all the maids, the most agree:"
2514,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The riper sort, knowing what 'tis to be"
2515,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The first mouth of a news so far derived,"
2516,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And that to hear and bear news brave folks lived.                280
2517,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,As being a carriage special hard to bear
2518,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Occurrents, these occurrents being so dear,"
2519,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"They did with grace protest, they were content"
2520,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"T' accost their friends with all their compliment,"
2521,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"For Hymen's good; but to incur their harm,"
2522,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,There he must pardon them. This wit went warm
2523,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"To Adolesche's[101] brain, a nymph born high,"
2524,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Made all of voice and fire, that upwards fly:"
2525,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Her heart and all her forces' nether train
2526,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Climb'd to her tongue, and thither fell her brain,               290"
2527,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Since it could go no higher; and it must go;
2528,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"All powers she had, even her tongue, did so:"
2529,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"In spirit and quickness she much joy did take,"
2530,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And loved her tongue, only for quickness' sake;"
2531,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And she would haste and tell. The rest all stay:
2532,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Hymen goes one, the nymph another way;"
2533,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And what became of her I'll tell at last:
2534,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Yet take her visage now;--moist-lipped, long-faced,"
2535,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Thin like an iron wedge, so sharp and tart,"
2536,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,As 'twere of purpose made to cleave Love's heart:                300
2537,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Well were this lovely beauty rid of her.
2538,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And Hymen did at Athens now prefer
2539,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"His welcome suit, which he with joy aspired:"
2540,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,A hundred princely youths with him retired
2541,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,To fetch the nymphs; chariots and music went;
2542,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And home they came: heaven with applauses rent.
2543,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The nuptials straight proceed, whiles all the town,"
2544,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Fresh in their joys, might do them most renown."
2545,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"First, gold-locked Hymen did to church repair,"
2546,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Like a quick offering burned in flames of hair;                  310
2547,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And after, with a virgin firmament"
2548,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,The godhead-proving bride attended went
2549,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Before them all: she looked in her command,"
2550,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,As if form-giving Cypria's silver hand
2551,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Gripped all their beauties, and crushed out one flame;"
2552,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,She blushed to see how beauty overcame
2553,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The thoughts of all men. Next, before her went"
2554,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Five lovely children, decked with ornament"
2555,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Of her sweet colours, bearing torches by;"
2556,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,For light was held a happy augury                                320
2557,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Of generation, whose efficient right"
2558,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Is nothing else but to produce to light.
2559,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The odd disparent number they did choose,"
2560,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"To show the union married loves should use,"
2561,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Since in two equal parts it will not sever,"
2562,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"But the midst holds one to rejoin it ever,"
2563,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,As common to both parts: men therefore deem
2564,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"That equal number gods do not esteem,"
2565,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Being authors of sweet peace and unity,"
2566,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"But pleasing to th' infernal empery,                             330"
2567,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Under whose ensigns Wars and Discords fight,"
2568,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Since an even number you may disunite
2569,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"In two parts equal, naught in middle left"
2570,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,To reunite each part from other reft;
2571,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And five they hold in most especial prize,[102]"
2572,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Since 'tis the first odd number that doth rise
2573,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"From the two foremost numbers' unity,"
2574,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,That odd and even are; which are two and three;
2575,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,For one no number is; but thence doth flow
2576,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The powerful race of number. Next, did go                        340"
2577,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"A noble matron, that did spinning bear"
2578,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"A huswife's rock and spindle, and did wear"
2579,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"A wether's skin, with all the snowy fleece,"
2580,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,To intimate that even the daintiest piece
2581,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And noblest-born dame should industrious be:
2582,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,That which does good disgraceth no degree.
2583,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And now to Juno's temple they are come,"
2584,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Where her grave priest stood in the marriage-room:
2585,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"On his right arm did hang a scarlet veil,"
2586,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And from his shoulders to the ground did trail,                  350"
2587,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"On either side, ribands of white and blue:"
2588,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,With the red veil he hid the bashful hue
2589,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Of the chaste bride, to show the modest shame,"
2590,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"In coupling with a man, should grace a dame."
2591,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Then took he the disparent silks, and tied"
2592,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The lovers by the waists, and side to side,"
2593,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,In token that thereafter they must bind
2594,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,In one self-sacred knot each other's mind.
2595,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Before them on an altar he presented
2596,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Both fire and water, which was first invented,                   360"
2597,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Since to ingenerate every human creature
2598,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And every other birth produc'd by Nature,"
2599,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Moisture and heat must mix; so man and wife
2600,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,For human race must join in nuptial life.
2601,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Then one of Juno's birds, the painted jay,"
2602,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,He sacrific'd and took the gall away;
2603,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"All which he did behind the altar throw,"
2604,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"In sign no bitterness of hate should grow,"
2605,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"'Twixt married loves, nor any least disdain."
2606,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Nothing they spake, for 'twas esteem'd too plain                 370"
2607,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"For the most silken mildness of a maid,"
2608,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"To let a public audience hear it said,"
2609,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,She boldly took the man; and so respected
2610,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Was bashfulness in Athens, it erected"
2611,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"To chaste Agneia,[103] which is Shamefacedness,"
2612,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"A sacred temple, holding her a goddess."
2613,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And now to feasts, masks, and triumphant shows,"
2614,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The shining troops returned, even till earth-throes"
2615,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Brought forth with joy the thickest part of night,"
2616,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"When the sweet nuptial song, that used to cite                   380"
2617,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"All to their rest, was by Phemonˆe[104] sung,"
2618,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"First Delphian prophetess, whose graces sprung"
2619,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Out of the Muses' well: she sung before
2620,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,The bride into her chamber; at which door
2621,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,A matron and a torch-bearer did stand:
2622,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,A painted box of confits[105] in her hand
2623,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The matron held, and so did other some[106]"
2624,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,That compassed round the honour'd nuptial room.
2625,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The custom was, that every maid did wear,"
2626,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"During her maidenhead, a silken sphere                           390"
2627,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"About her waist, above her inmost weed,"
2628,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Knit with Minerva's knot, and that was freed"
2629,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"By the fair bridegroom on the marriage-night,"
2630,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,With many ceremonies of delight:
2631,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And yet eternized Hymen's tender bride,"
2632,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"To suffer it dissolved so, sweetly cried."
2633,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The maids that heard, so loved and did adore her,"
2634,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,They wished with all their hearts to suffer for her.
2635,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"So had the matrons, that with confits stood"
2636,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"About the chamber, such affectionate blood,                      400"
2637,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And so true feeling of her harmless pains,"
2638,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,That every one a shower of confits rains;
2639,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"For which the bride-youths scrambling on the ground,"
2640,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,In noise of that sweet hail her[107] cries were drown'd.
2641,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And thus blest Hymen joyed his gracious bride,"
2642,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And for his joy was after deified.
2643,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The saffron mirror by which Phoebus' love,"
2644,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Green Tellus, decks her, now he held above"
2645,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"The cloudy mountains: and the noble maid,"
2646,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Sharp-visaged Adolesche, that was stray'd                        410"
2647,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Out of her way, in hasting with her news,"
2648,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,Not till this[108] hour th' Athenian turrets views;
2649,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"And now brought home by guides, she heard by all,"
2650,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"That her long kept occurrents would be stale,"
2651,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,And how fair Hymen's honours did excel
2652,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,For those rare news which she came short to tell.
2653,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"To hear her dear tongue robbed of such a joy,"
2654,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,"Made the well-spoken nymph take such a toy,[109]"
2655,THE FIFTH SESTIAD.,That down she sunk: when lightning from above

2946,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,For his rare judgment in th' attire he wears;
2947,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,"Hath seen the hot Low-Countries, not their heat,"
2948,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,Observes their rampires and their buildings yet;
2949,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,"And, for your sweet discourse with mouths, is heard"

3019,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,"Consume each other: O, true glass, to see"
3020,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,How ruinous ambitious statists be
3021,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,To their own glories! Poor Leander cried
3022,THE SIXTH SESTIAD.,For help to sea-born Venus she denied;                           190

10257,RYCHARD BAME.,"of Isaiah. Again, as to the statement that Romanism alone is logical,"
