89,PREFACE,
90,PREFACE,The aim of this book is to give the materials for the inductive study of
91,PREFACE,"English verse. Its origin was in certain university courses, for which"
92,PREFACE,it proved to be necessary--often for use in a single hour's work--to
93,PREFACE,"gather almost numberless books, some of which must ordinarily be"
94,PREFACE,inaccessible except in the vicinity of large libraries. I have tried to
95,PREFACE,extract from these books the materials necessary for the study of
96,PREFACE,"English verse-forms, adding notes designed to make the specimens"
97,PREFACE,intelligible and useful.
98,PREFACE,
99,PREFACE,Dealing with a subject where theories are almost as numerous as those
100,PREFACE,"who have written on it, it has been my purpose to avoid the setting"
101,PREFACE,"forth of my own opinions, and to present the subject-matter in a way"
102,PREFACE,"suited, so far as possible, to the use of those holding widely divergent"
103,PREFACE,views. In the arrangement and naming of the earlier sections of the
104,PREFACE,"book, some systematic theory of the subject--accepted at least"
105,PREFACE,tentatively--was indeed indispensable; but I trust that even here those
106,PREFACE,who would apply to English verse a different classification or
107,PREFACE,terminology may be able to discard what they cannot approve and to make
108,PREFACE,use of the specimens from their own standpoint. Even where (as in these
109,PREFACE,introductory sections) the notes seem to overtop the text somewhat
110,PREFACE,"threateningly, they are invariably intended--as the type indicates--to"
111,PREFACE,"be subordinate. Where it has been possible to do so, I have preferred to"
112,PREFACE,"present comments on the specimens in the words of other writers, and"
113,PREFACE,"have not confined these notes to opinions with which I wholly agree, but"
114,PREFACE,only to those which seem worthy of attention. My own views on the more
115,PREFACE,disputed elements of the subject (such as the relations of time and
116,PREFACE,"accent in our verse, the presence of ""quantity"" in English, and the"
117,PREFACE,"terminology of the subject) I have reserved for Part Three, where I"
118,PREFACE,"trust they will be found helpful by some readers, but where they may"
119,PREFACE,easily be passed over.
120,PREFACE,
121,PREFACE,"To classify the materials of this subject is peculiarly difficult, and"
122,PREFACE,one who tries to solve the problem will early abandon the hope of being
123,PREFACE,able to follow any system with consistency. Main divisions and
124,PREFACE,subdivisions will inevitably conflict and overlap. For practical
125,PREFACE,"purposes, basing my arrangement in part on that found convenient in"
126,PREFACE,university lectures (which it will be seen is not altogether unlike that
127,PREFACE,"followed by Schipper in his _Englische Metrik_), I have divided the"
128,PREFACE,"specimens of verse into two main divisions, each of which is suggested"
129,PREFACE,by a word in the sub-title of the book. Part One contains specimens
130,PREFACE,"designed to illustrate the principles of English verse, arranged in"
131,PREFACE,topical order. Part Two contains specimens designed to illustrate the
132,PREFACE,"history of the more important forms of English verse, arranged--in the"
133,PREFACE,several divisions--in chronological order. Part Three has already been
134,PREFACE,spoken of. Part Four contains extracts from important critical writers
135,PREFACE,"on the place and function of the verse-element in poetry,--matters which"
136,PREFACE,give us the _raison d'être_ for the whole study of versification.
137,PREFACE,
138,PREFACE,If there had ever been hope of making the collection of specimens fairly
139,PREFACE,"complete, even in a representative sense, this would have been"
140,PREFACE,"dissipated by the discovery, during the very time of the book's going"
141,PREFACE,"through the press, of a number of additional specimens which it seemed"
142,PREFACE,wicked to omit. Doubtless every reader will miss some favorite selection
143,PREFACE,"which might well have been included, and suggestions as to important"
144,PREFACE,omissions will be received gratefully. The attempt has been to put
145,PREFACE,students on the track of all the more important lines of development of
146,PREFACE,"English verse, and to indicate, by including a considerable number of"
147,PREFACE,"specimens from early periods, the continuity of this development from"
148,PREFACE,the times of our Saxon forefathers to our own.
149,PREFACE,
150,PREFACE,Little consistency can be claimed for the practice observed in the
151,PREFACE,matter of modernizing texts that date from transition periods like the
152,PREFACE,"sixteenth century. In some cases the text has been modernized, or"
153,PREFACE,"retained in its original form, according as it seemed well to emphasize"
154,PREFACE,either the permanent significance or the historical position of the
155,PREFACE,specimen in question. In other cases the form of the text was determined
156,PREFACE,merely by the best edition accessible for purposes of reproduction.
157,PREFACE,
158,PREFACE,Dates have been appended to the specimens in those sections where
159,PREFACE,chronology is a significant element. It has not always been possible to
160,PREFACE,"verify these dates with thoroughness, or to distinguish between the date"
161,PREFACE,of writing and that of publication; but it is hoped that inaccuracies of
162,PREFACE,this sort will at least not be found of a character to misrepresent the
163,PREFACE,historical relations of the specimens. Dates are not ordinarily given
164,PREFACE,for the poems of writers still living.
165,PREFACE,
166,PREFACE,In the notes on the specimens I have tried to distinguish between
167,PREFACE,material likely to be useful for all students of the subject and that
168,PREFACE,"going more into detail, which is intended only for advanced or special"
169,PREFACE,students. Notes of the second class are printed in smaller type. There
170,PREFACE,has been no attempt to give the notes of a bibliographical character any
171,PREFACE,"pretension to completeness. One may well hesitate to add, in this"
172,PREFACE,"direction, to the admirable material presented in the _Methods and"
173,PREFACE,Materials of Literary Criticism_ of Professors Gayley and Scott.
174,PREFACE,
175,PREFACE,I have resisted strenuously all temptation to choose or to annotate
176,PREFACE,"specimens on general grounds of æsthetic enjoyment, apart from the"
177,PREFACE,distinct study of verse-forms. Yet it would be useless to deny having
178,PREFACE,"sometimes made choice of particular verses, all other considerations"
179,PREFACE,"being equal, for their poetic or literary value over and above their"
180,PREFACE,prosodical. I shall not claim for the collection what Boswell did for
181,PREFACE,"Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, that ""he was so attentive in the choice"" of"
182,PREFACE,"the illustrative passages ""that one may read page after page ... with"
183,PREFACE,"improvement and pleasure;"" yet I may say that, so far from fearing that"
184,PREFACE,the enjoyment of any poem will be injured by a proper attention to the
185,PREFACE,"elements of its metrical form, it is my hope that many a haunting verse"
186,PREFACE,"may linger, a perpetual possession of beauty, in the memory of the"
187,PREFACE,student who first found it here classified under a technical name.
188,PREFACE,
189,PREFACE,Many obligations are to be acknowledged to scholars of whose advice I
190,PREFACE,have availed myself. Most kindly aid has been received from Professor G.
191,PREFACE,"L. Kittredge and Dr. Fred N. Robinson, of Harvard University; from"
192,PREFACE,"Professor Felix E. Schelling, of the University of Pennsylvania; from my"
193,PREFACE,"friend, Mr. H. P. Earle, of Stanford University; and from my colleague,"
194,PREFACE,Dr. Ewald Flügel. My obligation to Schipper's monumental works on
195,PREFACE,English verse will be obvious to every scholar. They suggested many of
196,PREFACE,"the specimens of verse-forms, and are also represented by translations"
197,PREFACE,"or paraphrases in the notes; references to Schipper, without full"
198,PREFACE,"title, are to the _Englische Metrik_,--the larger work. I have also made"
199,PREFACE,"thankful use of Mr. John Addington Symonds's essays on Blank Verse, and"
200,PREFACE,"of Professor Corson's _Primer of English Verse_,--both somewhat"
201,PREFACE,unscientific but highly suggestive works. The section on Artificial
202,PREFACE,French Forms obviously owes very much to Mr. Gleeson White's _Ballades
203,PREFACE,and Rondeaus_. A book to which my obligation is out of all proportion to
204,PREFACE,the number of actual quotations from it is Mr. J. B. Mayor's _Chapters
205,PREFACE,"on English Metre_. This modest but satisfying volume seemed to me, when"
206,PREFACE,"I first was taking up the study of English verse, to be a grateful"
207,PREFACE,relief from the thorny and often fruitless discussions with which the
208,PREFACE,"subject had been overgrown; and in returning to it again and again, I"
209,PREFACE,have never failed to renew the impression. Its suggestions underlie a
210,PREFACE,good part of the system of classification and terminology adopted for
211,PREFACE,"this book. The new and enlarged edition came to hand too late for use,"
212,PREFACE,but I was able to include references to it in the notes.
213,PREFACE,
214,PREFACE,I must also record thanks to those authors and publishers who have
215,PREFACE,courteously given permission for the reproduction of their publications:
216,PREFACE,"to Mr. John Lane, for permission to quote from the works of Mr. William"
217,PREFACE,"Watson and Mr. Stephen Phillips; to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin and"
218,PREFACE,"Company, for permission to make extracts from the poems of Mr. William"
219,PREFACE,Vaughn Moody and from Mr. Stedman's _Nature and Elements of Poetry_; to
220,PREFACE,"Macmillan and Company, Limited, of London, for permission to make"
221,PREFACE,extracts from Professor Butcher's _Aristotle's Theory of Poetry_ and
222,PREFACE,from Mr. Courthope's _Life in Poetry and Law in Taste_; to Professor F.
223,PREFACE,"B. Gummere and The Macmillan Company of New York, for permission to"
224,PREFACE,quote from the former's _Beginnings of Poetry_; to the Lothrop
225,PREFACE,"Publishing Company of Boston, for permission to reprint Mr. Clinton"
226,PREFACE,"Scollard's villanelle, ""Spring Knocks at Winter's Frosty Door,"" from the"
227,PREFACE,"volume entitled _With Reed and Lyre_; to Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman,"
228,PREFACE,"for permission to reprint her rondeau, ""A Man must Live,"" from the"
229,PREFACE,"volume entitled _On This Our World_ (published by Small, Maynard and"
230,PREFACE,"Company); to Dr. Samuel Minturn Peck, for permission to reprint one of"
231,PREFACE,"the triolets called ""Under the Rose,"" from his volume entitled _Cap and"
232,PREFACE,"Bells_; to the Frederick A. Stokes Company, for permission to reprint"
233,PREFACE,"Mr. Frank D. Sherman's ""Ballade to Austin Dobson,"" from the volume"
234,PREFACE,"entitled _Madrigals and Catches_. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, Mr. W. E."
235,PREFACE,"Henley, and Mr. Edmund Gosse have given generous permission to quote"
236,PREFACE,freely from their poems. Mr. Henley was also good enough to suggest the
237,PREFACE,"choice of the rondeau from his ""Bric-à-Brac""; and Mr. Gosse, whose"
238,PREFACE,unfailing courtesy follows up his numerous published aids to students of
239,PREFACE,"English poetry, has also added some personal notes on the history of the"
240,PREFACE,heroic couplet.
241,PREFACE,
242,PREFACE,"Finally, it should be said that a considerable part of the studies"
243,PREFACE,resulting in this book was carried on while the editor held the Senior
244,PREFACE,Fellowship in English on the Harrison Foundation in the University of
245,PREFACE,"Pennsylvania. If, therefore, the book should prove of service to any,"
246,PREFACE,the fact will be a single additional tribute to the munificence of that
247,PREFACE,foundation.

428,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"of three such degrees: syllables having accent (stressed), syllables"
429,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"having secondary accent, and syllables without accent (unstressed)."
430,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,Schipper makes four groups: Principal Accent (_Hauptaccent_ or
431,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"_Hochton_), Secondary Accent (_Nebenaccent_ or _Tiefton_), No Accent"
432,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"(_Tonlosigkeit_), and Disappearance of Sound (_Stummheit_). In"
433,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"illustration he gives the word _ponderous_, where the first syllable has"
434,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"the chief accent, the last a secondary accent, the second no accent;"
435,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,while in the verse
436,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
437,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"""Most ponderous and substantial things"""
438,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,

477,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,It is worthy of note that the secondary accent seems originally to have
478,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,been a more important factor in English verse than it is commonly
479,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,considered to be in modern periods. In Anglo-Saxon verse the combination
480,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"of a primary stress, a secondary stress, and an unstressed syllable, is"
481,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,a recognized type. In modern verse the reader is likely to make an
482,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,effort to reduce all syllables to the type of either stress or
483,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"no-stress. In such a verse as the following, however (from Matthew"
484,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"Arnold's _Forsaken Merman_),--"
485,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
486,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"""And I lose my poor soul, Merman, here with thee,""--"
487,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
488,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,we may find such a combination as that just referred to as familiar in
489,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"Anglo-Saxon rhythm. The syllables ""_soul, Merman_"" are respectively"
490,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"cases of primary stress, secondary stress, and no-stress. On this matter"
491,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"see further the remark of Luick, cited on p. 156, below."
492,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
493,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,The element of Pitch is not ordinarily included in the treatment of
494,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"versification, as it is not ordinarily recognized as having any"
495,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,significance peculiar to verse. According to Professor J. W.
496,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"Bright, however, there is such a thing as a ""pitch-accent"" which"
497,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,plays an important part in verse where the word-accent conflicts
498,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"with that of the regular metre. Under certain exigencies, he says,"
499,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"""_un-governed, pre-cisely, re-markable,_ and _Je-rusalem_ ... are"
500,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"naturally pronounced with a pitch-accent upon the first syllables,"
501,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,and with the undisturbed expiratory word-accent upon the second. It
502,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,will of course be understood that when the word-accent is defined
503,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,as expiratory this term does not exclude the inherent pitch of
504,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"English stress. Force, quantity, and pitch are combined in our"
505,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"word-stress (or word-accent), both primary and secondary; but in"
506,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,the secondary stress used as ictus there is a noticeable change in
507,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"the proportions of these elements, the pitch being relatively"
508,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,increased. An answer is thus won for the question: How do we
509,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"naturally pronounce two stresses in juxtaposition on the same word,"
510,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,or on adjacent words closely joined grammatically? This is further
511,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,illustrated in the specially emphasized words of such expressions
512,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"as 'The idea!'"" where Professor Bright marks the pitch-accent on"
513,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"the first syllable of ""idea,"" retaining the stress-accent on the"
514,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,second syllable. In the line
515,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
516,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"""Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit"""
517,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
518,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,he marks a pitch-accent where the word-stress and metrical stress
519,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"are in conflict, that is, on the syllables ""dis-"" and ""and."" ""The"
520,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"rhythmic use of 'disobedience,'"" he says, ""illustrates with its"
521,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,four syllables (as here used) as many recognizable varieties of
522,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"stress. The first syllable has a secondary word-accent, raised to a"
523,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,pitch-accent for ictus; the second is wholly unaccented; the third
524,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"has the chief word-accent, employed as ictus (the accent of the"
525,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"preceding word, ""first,"" is subordinate to the rhythm); the fourth"
526,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"has a secondary word-accent which remains unchanged in the thesis."""
527,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"The conclusion is that ""ictus in conflict requires a pitch-accent."""

529,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"English Verse,' in the _Publications of the Modern Language"
530,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"Association_, n.s. vol. vii. No. 3). Professor Bright's theory of"
531,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,pitch-accent is a part of his general theory of opposition to what
532,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"he calls the ""sense-doctrine"" of the reading of verse,--that is,"
533,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,the accepted doctrine that the word and sentence accents must
534,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,ordinarily take precedence of the metrical accent.
535,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
536,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"According to cause or significance, accents are commonly classed in"
537,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"three groups: Etymological or Word Accent, Syntactical or Rhetorical"
538,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"Accent, and Metrical Accent. Accents of the first class are due to the"
539,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,original stress of the syllable in English speech; those of the second
540,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,class are due to the importance of the syllable in the sentence; those
541,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,of the third class are due to the place of the syllable in the metrical
542,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,scheme. In the verse
543,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
544,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"""Mary had a little lamb,"""
545,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
546,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,the first syllable may be said to be stressed primarily for etymological
547,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"reasons, the seventh primarily for syntactical or rhetorical reasons,"
548,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,and the third (which would not be accented in prose) for metrical
549,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,reasons.
550,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,
551,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,The general law of English verse is that only those syllables which bear
552,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"the accent of the first class (that is, which are stressed in common"
553,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"speech), together with monosyllables which on occasion are stressed in"
554,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"common speech, shall be placed so as to receive the metrical stress; and"
555,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"that, if the word-stress and the metrical stress apparently conflict,"
556,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"the metrical stress must yield. Less generally, the rhetorical or"
557,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,syntactical accent in the same way takes precedence of the metrical. In
558,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,both cases exceptions are of course numerous.

671,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,Of special interest are the examples of wrenched and hovering
672,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,accent found in the verse of Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of

674,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,syllable-counting principle was coming into prominence in English
675,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"verse, under the new culture of the days of Henry VIII. The first"
676,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,conscious followers of this principle seem to have given it such
677,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,prominence that a verse seemed good to them if it contained the
678,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,"requisite number of syllables, whether the accents conformed to any"
679,A.--KINDS OF ACCENT,regular system or not. In the case of Wyatt we can also compare the

741,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
742,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,The fundamental principle of the rhythm of English verse (and indeed of
743,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,any rhythm) is that _the accents appear at regular time-intervals_. In
744,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,practice there is of course great freedom in departing from this
745,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"regularity, the equal time-intervals being at times only a standard of"
746,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,rhythm to which the varying successions of accented and unaccented
747,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,syllables are mentally referred. Where the equal time-intervals are
748,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"observed with substantial regularity, two sorts of verse are still to"
749,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,be clearly distinguished: that in which not only the intervals of time
750,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,but the numbers of syllables between the accents are substantially equal
751,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"and regular, and that in which the number of syllables varies. The"
752,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,latter class is that of the native Germanic metres; the former is that
753,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"of the Romance metres, and of modern English verse as influenced by"
754,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,them. With the development of regularity in the counting of syllables
755,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,there has perhaps also taken place a development of regularity in the
756,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"regular counting of the time-intervals. In other words, the modern"
757,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"English reader, where the number of syllables between accents is"
758,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"variable, makes the time-intervals as nearly equal as possible by"
759,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,lengthening and shortening the syllables in the manner permitted by the
760,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"freedom of English speech; in early English verse, where the number of"
761,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"syllables between accents varied very greatly, we cannot be sure that"
762,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,the time-intervals were so accurately felt or preserved in recitation.

886,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
887,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"In his Preface to this poem Coleridge said: ""The metre of the"
888,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"_Christabel_ is not, properly speaking, irregular, though it may seem so"
889,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"from its being founded on a new principle; namely, that of counting in"
890,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"each line the accents, not the syllables. Though the latter may vary"
891,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"from seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents will be found to be"
892,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,only four. Nevertheless this occasional variation in number of syllables
893,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"is not introduced wantonly, or for the mere ends of convenience, but in"
894,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"correspondence with some transition, in the nature of the imagery or"
895,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"passion."" The verse is accurately described, but it has frequently been"
896,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,pointed out as curious that Coleridge should have spoken of it as
897,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"""founded on a new principle,"" when the principle in question was that of"
898,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,native English verse from the earliest times.[5]

906,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
907,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,(a) Pauses not filling the time of syllables.
908,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
909,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,Most English verses of more than eight syllables are divided not only
910,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"into the time-intervals between the accents, but also into two parts"
911,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"(which Schipper calls ""rhythmical series"") by the _Cesura_. The Cesura"
912,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"is a pause not counted out of the regular time of the rhythm, but"
913,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"corresponding to the pauses between ""phrases"" in music, and nearly"
914,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,always coinciding with syntactical or rhetorical divisions of the
915,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,sentence.
916,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
917,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"The medial cesura is the typical pause of this kind, dividing the verse"
918,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,into two parts of approximately equal length. In much early English
919,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"verse, and in French verse, this medial cesura is almost universal; in"
920,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"modern English verse (and in that of some early poets, notably Chaucer)"
921,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"there is great freedom in the placing of the cesura, and also in"
922,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,omitting it altogether. The importance of this matter in the history of
923,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,English decasyllabic verse will appear in Part Two.
924,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
925,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,In the early Elizabethan period the impression was still general
926,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,that there should be a regular medial cesura. Spenser seems to have
927,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,been the first to imitate the greater freedom of Chaucer in this
928,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,regard. See the Latin dissertation on Spenser's verse of E. Legouis
929,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"(_Quomodo E. Spenserus_, etc., Paris, 1896), and the summary of its"
930,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,results by Mr. J. B. Fletcher in _Modern Language Notes_ for
931,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"November, 1898. ""Spenser,"" says Mr. Fletcher, ""revived for 'heroic"
932,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,verse' the neglected variety in unity of his self-acknowledged
933,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"master, Chaucer."" In Gascoigne's _Notes of Instruction concerning"
934,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"the making of verse or ryme in English_ (1575), we find: ""There are"
935,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,also certayne pauses or restes in a verse whiche may be called
936,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"Ceasures.... In mine opinion in a verse of eight sillables, the"
937,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"pause will stand best in the middest, in a verse of tenne it will"
938,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,be placed at the ende of the first foure sillables; in a verse of
939,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"twelve, in the midst.... In Rithme royall, it is at the wryters"
940,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"discretion, and forceth not where the pause be untill the ende of"
941,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"the line."" This greater liberty allowed the rime royal is doubtless"
942,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,due to the influence of Chaucer on that form. For Gascoigne's
943,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"practice in printing his verse with medial cesura, even without"
944,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"regard to rhetorical divisions, see the specimen given below."
945,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
946,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,Another interesting Elizabethan account of the cesura is found in
947,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"Puttenham's _Arte of English Poesie_ (1589), where the writer"
948,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,compares the verse-pause to a stop made by a traveler at an inn for

984,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,Part Two.
985,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
986,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,The Cesura is called _masculine_ when it follows an accented syllable.
987,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"(For examples, see previous specimen from Gascoigne.) It is called"
988,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,_feminine_ when it follows an unaccented syllable. Two varieties of the
989,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"feminine cesura are also distinguished: the Lyric, when the pause occurs"
990,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,inside a foot; _e.g._:
991,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
992,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"""This wicked traitor, whom I thus accuse;"""
993,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
994,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"the Epic, when the pause occurs after an extra (hypermetrical) light"
995,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,syllable; _e.g._:
996,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
997,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"""To Canterbury with ful devout corage."""
998,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
999,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"""But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives."""
1000,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
1001,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"The ""epic"" cesura is quite as characteristic of dramatic blank verse as"
1002,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,of epic.
1003,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,
1004,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,The pause occurring at the end of a line is equally regular with the
1005,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"medial pause, and corresponds in the same way to a phrase-pause in"
1006,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"music. It is an element of the same character, then, as the cesura,"
1007,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,though not bearing the same name. It coincides less closely than the
1008,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,cesura with syntactical and rhetorical pauses. When there is no
1009,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,corresponding syntactical or rhetorical pause at the end of the line (in
1010,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"other words, when the metrical pause marking the end of the verse cannot"
1011,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,be prominently represented in reading without interfering with the
1012,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"expression of the sense), the line is said to be ""run-on."" Such an"
1013,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,ending is also called _enjambement_. The importance of this distinction
1014,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"between ""end-stopped"" and ""run-on"" lines will appear in the notes on the"

1021,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,time of the pause is counted in the metrical scheme. Pauses of this
1022,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,"class correspond to rests in music; and as in the case of such rests,"
1023,B.--TIME-INTERVALS,their occurrence is exceptional.

2385,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"Deficiency of accent is the most common of all the variations, if we"
2386,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"understand by ""accent"" such syllabic stress as would be ordinarily"
2387,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,appreciable in the reading of the word in question. It would be safe to
2388,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"say that in English five-stress iambic verse, read with only the"
2389,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"ordinary etymological and rhetorical accents, twenty-five per cent of"
2390,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,the verses lack the full five stresses characteristic of the type. In
2391,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"many cases, too, a foot with deficiency in stress is compensated for by"
2392,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,another foot in the same verse showing excess of stress. Feet thus
2393,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"deficient in stress may conveniently be called _pyrrhics_, the pyrrhic"
2394,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,being understood as made up of two unstressed syllables. This term has
2395,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"never become fully domesticated in English prosody, and some object to"
2396,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,its use on the ground that we have no feet wholly without stress. Its
2397,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"use in the sense just indicated, however, seems to be an unquestionable"
2398,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,convenience.

2400,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"Excess of accent, while less common than deficiency of accent, is even"
2401,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"more easily recognizable. The foot containing two stressed syllables,"
2402,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,even though one of the stresses may be distinctly stronger than the
2403,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"other, may conveniently be called a _spondee_."
2404,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,
2405,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"Inversion of accent is exceedingly familiar, especially at the beginning"
2406,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"of the verse and after the medial pause. It consists, technically"
2407,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"speaking, in the substitution of a trochee for an iambus or an iambus"
2408,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,for a trochee (the latter very rarely).
2409,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,
2410,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"A light syllable inserted in dissyllabic measure is not unusual, though"
2411,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,by no means so common as the variations previously enumerated. Such a
2412,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"syllable is frequently spoken of as ""hypermetrical""; or, the variation"
2413,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"may be considered as the substitution of an anapest for an iambus, in"
2414,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"iambic measure, or the substitution of a dactyl for a trochee, in"
2415,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,trochaic measure.
2416,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,
2417,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,The omission of one of the two light syllables from the foot in
2418,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,trisyllabic verse is so common as to make it difficult to find pure
2419,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,anapestic or dactylic verse in English. This fact is due in part to
2420,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"preference for dissyllabic measures, and in part to the usual"
2421,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"indifference, in all Germanic verse, to accuracy in the number of light"
2422,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,syllables. The variation may frequently be regarded as involving a
2423,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"prolongation of the light syllable of the foot, or a pause equal to the"
2424,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"time of the omitted syllable; technically speaking, it consists in the"
2425,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"substitution of an iambus for an anapest, or a trochee for a dactyl."

2600,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,
2601,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"(1) The limit of trochaic substitution is three feet out of five, with"
2602,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"the final foot iambic; or two out of five, if the fifth foot is"
2603,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,inverted.
2604,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,
2605,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,(2) A spondee is allowable in any position; the limit is four out of

2608,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"(3) A pyrrhic may occur in any position; the limit is three out of five,"

2615,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,Professor Corson discusses the æsthetic effect of these changes from the
2616,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"typical metre: ""The true metrical artist ... never indulges in variety"
2617,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,for variety's sake.... All metrical effects are to a great extent
2618,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"_relative_--and relativity of effect depends, of course, upon having a"
2619,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,standard in the mind or feelings.... Now the more closely the poet
2620,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,adheres to his standard--to the even tenor (modulus) of his verse--so
2621,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"long as there is no logical nor æsthetic motive for departing from it,"
2622,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,the more effective do his departures become when they are sufficiently
2623,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,motived. All non-significant departures weaken the significant ones....
2624,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,The normal tenor of the verse is presumed to represent the normal tenor
2625,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,of the feeling which produces it. And departures from that normal tenor
2626,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"represent, or should represent, variations in the normal tenor of the"
2627,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,feeling. Outside of the general law ... of the slurring or suppression
2628,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"of extra light syllables, which do not go for anything in the"
2629,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"expression, an exceptional foot must result in emphasis, whether"
2630,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"intended or not, either logical or emotional.... A great poet is"
2631,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,presumed to have metrical skill; and where ripples occur in the stream
2632,COMBINATIONS AND SUBSTITUTIONS,"of his verse, they will generally be found to justify themselves as"

3040,QUATRAINS,
3041,QUATRAINS,"To Davenant's _Gondibert_ is usually traced the use of this ""heroic"""
3042,QUATRAINS,stanza (_abab_ in iambic five-stress lines) in the seventeenth and
3043,QUATRAINS,"eighteenth centuries. In his preface the author said: ""I believed it"
3044,QUATRAINS,"would be more pleasant to the reader, in a work of length, to give this"
3045,QUATRAINS,"respite or pause, between every stanza, ... than to run him out of"
3046,QUATRAINS,breath with continued couplets. Nor doth alternate rime by any lowliness
3047,QUATRAINS,"of cadence make the sound less heroic, but rather adapt it to a plain"
3048,QUATRAINS,"and stately composing of music."" Dryden followed Davenant in using the"
3049,QUATRAINS,"stanza for his _Annus Mirabilis_, saying in his preface: ""I have chosen"
3050,QUATRAINS,"to write my poem in quatrains, or stanzas of four in alternate rhyme,"
3051,QUATRAINS,"because I have ever judged them more noble, and of greater dignity, both"
3052,QUATRAINS,"for the sound and number, than any other verse in use amongst us.... I"
3053,QUATRAINS,have always found the couplet verse most easy (though not so proper for
3054,QUATRAINS,"this occasion), for there the work is sooner at an end, every two lines"
3055,QUATRAINS,concluding the labor of the poet; but in quatrains he is to carry it
3056,QUATRAINS,"further on, and not only so, but to bear along in his head the"
3057,QUATRAINS,"troublesome sense of four lines together."" Dryden did not use the stanza"
3058,QUATRAINS,"again, however, and it is obviously unsuited to a long narrative poem."
3059,QUATRAINS,"Saintsbury says: ""With regard to the nobility and dignity of this"
3060,QUATRAINS,"stanza, it may safely be said that _Annus Mirabilis_ itself, the best"
3061,QUATRAINS,"poem ever written therein, killed it by exposing its faults.... It is"
3062,QUATRAINS,"chargeable with more than the disjointedness of the couplet, without the"
3063,QUATRAINS,"possibility of relief; while, on the other hand, the quatrains have not,"
3064,QUATRAINS,"like the Spenserian stave or the _ottava rima_, sufficient bulk to form"
3065,QUATRAINS,"units in themselves."" (_Life of Dryden_, Men of Letters Series, p. 34.)"
3066,QUATRAINS,
3067,QUATRAINS,It is hard to say what Mr. Saintsbury means in speaking of the _Annus
3068,QUATRAINS,"Mirabilis_ as the best poem ever written in the heroic quatrain, when we"
3069,QUATRAINS,remember that it is the quatrain of Gray's _Elegy_. On the possible
3070,QUATRAINS,"sources of his use of it, see Gosse's _Life of Gray_, in the Men of"
3071,QUATRAINS,"Letters Series, p. 98 (also his _From Shakespeare to Pope_, p. 140). Mr."
3072,QUATRAINS,Gosse refers to the use of the quatrain by Sir John Davies in the _Nosce
3073,QUATRAINS,"Teipsum_ (1599), with which Gray was familiar, and (in addition to"
3074,QUATRAINS,"Davenant, Dryden, and Hobbes's _Homer_) to the _Love Elegies_ of James"
3075,QUATRAINS,"Hammond, published 1743. ""It is believed that the printing of Hammond's"
3076,QUATRAINS,"verses incited Gray to begin his _Churchyard Elegy_, and to make the"
3077,QUATRAINS,four-line stanza the basis of most of his harmonies.... The measure
3078,QUATRAINS,"itself, from first to last, is an attempt to render in English the"
3079,QUATRAINS,"solemn alternation of passion and reserve, the interchange of imploring"
3080,QUATRAINS,"and desponding tones, that is found in the Latin elegiac; and Gray gave"
3081,QUATRAINS,"his poem, when he first published it, an outward resemblance to the text"
3082,QUATRAINS,"of Tibullus by printing it without any stanzaic pauses."" Mr. Gosse"
3083,QUATRAINS,"neglects the elegies of William Shenstone, which were also in the"
3084,QUATRAINS,"quatrain, and some of which had apparently been published before the"
3085,QUATRAINS,_Churchyard Elegy_. On this matter see Beers's _Romanticism in the
3086,QUATRAINS,"Eighteenth Century_, p. 137, where Shenstone is said to have borrowed"
3087,QUATRAINS,"the stanza from Hammond, and Gray from Shenstone. Shenstone, in his"
3088,QUATRAINS,"_Prefatory Essay on Elegy_, defended the metrical form and referred to"
3089,QUATRAINS,"the elegies of Hammond. ""Heroic metre, with alternate rhyme, seems well"
3090,QUATRAINS,"enough adapted to this species of poetry; and, however exceptionable"
3091,QUATRAINS,"upon other occasions, its inconveniencies appear to lose their weight in"
3092,QUATRAINS,"shorter elegies, and its advantages seem to acquire an additional"
3093,QUATRAINS,importance. The world has an admirable example of its beauty in a
3094,QUATRAINS,"collection of elegies not long since published."" (Chalmers's _English"

3177,QUATRAINS,
3178,QUATRAINS,This stanza (_abba_ in four-stress iambics) is commonly known as the
3179,QUATRAINS,"""_In Memoriam_ stanza,"" from its familiar use by Tennyson. Tennyson is"
3180,QUATRAINS,"indeed said to have invented it for his own use, not knowing of its"
3181,QUATRAINS,earlier appearance in the works of Jonson and Rossetti. Professor Corson
3182,QUATRAINS,"has an interesting passage on the poetic quality of the stanza: ""By the"
3183,QUATRAINS,"rhyme-scheme of the quatrain, the terminal rhyme-emphasis of the stanza"
3184,QUATRAINS,"is reduced, the second and third verses being most closely braced by the"
3185,QUATRAINS,rhyme. The stanza is thus admirably adapted to that sweet continuity of
3186,QUATRAINS,"flow, free from abrupt checks, demanded by the spiritualized sorrow"
3187,QUATRAINS,which it bears along. Alternate rhyme would have wrought an entire
3188,QUATRAINS,"change in the tone of the poem. To be assured of this, one should read,"
3189,QUATRAINS,"aloud of course, all the stanzas whose first and second, or third and"
3190,QUATRAINS,"fourth, verses admit of being transposed without affecting the sense. By"
3191,QUATRAINS,"such transposition, the rhymes are made alternate, and the concluding"
3192,QUATRAINS,"rhymes more emphatic."" Compare the stanza quoted above from section"
3193,QUATRAINS,xxvii. with the transposed form:
3194,QUATRAINS,
3195,QUATRAINS,"""I feel it when I sorrow most;"
3196,QUATRAINS,"I hold it true, whate'er befall;"
3197,QUATRAINS,'Tis better to have loved and lost
3198,QUATRAINS,"Than never to have loved at all."""
3199,QUATRAINS,
3200,QUATRAINS,On the passage quoted from section lxxxiv. Professor Corson also
3201,QUATRAINS,"observes: ""The four stanzas of which it is composed constitute but one"
3202,QUATRAINS,"period, the sense being suspended till the close. The rhyme-emphasis is"
3203,QUATRAINS,"so distributed that any one, hearing the poem read, would hardly be"
3204,QUATRAINS,sensible of any of the slightest checks in the continuous and even
3205,QUATRAINS,movement of the verse.... There is no other section of _In Memoriam_ in
3206,QUATRAINS,"which the artistic motive of the stanza is so evident."" (_Primer of"

3624,REFRAIN STANZAS,Young was and is universally condemned for choosing this form of stanza

4573,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"the early Romance languages, the Provençal, Old French, and Spanish."
4574,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,Thus in the _Chanson de Roland_ (eleventh century) we find the verses of
4575,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"each _laisse_, or strophe, bound together by assonance. Frequently this"

4672,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4673,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,This specimen represents the use of alliteration in the most regularly
4674,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,constructed Anglo-Saxon verse. The two half-lines are united into the
4675,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,long line by the same initial consonant in the important syllables. In
4676,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the first half-line the alliteration is on the two principally stressed
4677,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"syllables, or on one of them alone (most frequently the first); in the"
4678,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,second half-line it is commonly found only on the first. Alliterating
4679,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,unstressed syllables are usually regarded as merely accidental. Any
4680,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,initial vowel sound alliterates with any other vowel sound.
4681,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4682,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,The most regular verse appears in Anglo-Saxon poetry of what may be
4683,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"called the classical period,--700 A.D. and for a century"
4684,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"following,--represented by _Beowulf_ and the poems of Cynewulf. By the"
4685,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"time of Ælfric, who wrote about 1000 A.D., there appear signs of a"
4686,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"breaking in the regular verse-form. (See Schipper, vol. i. pp. 60 ff.)"
4687,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"For example, two alliterative syllables often appear in the second"
4688,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,half-line; one half-line may be without alliteration; alliteration may
4689,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,bind different long-lines together; or alliteration may be altogether
4690,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"wanting. There are also additions of many light syllables, resulting"
4691,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"almost, as Schipper observes, in rhythmical prose. These tendencies"
4692,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,resulted in the wholly irregular use of alliteration appearing in much
4693,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"of the verse of the early Middle English period, illustrated in the"
4694,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,specimens that follow.

4697,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4698,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,The origins of alliteration in Germanic verse are lost in the general
4699,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,mass of Germanic origins. It is almost universally regarded as a purely
4700,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"native development, although M. Kawczynski (_Essai Comparatif sur"
4701,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"l'Origine et l'Histoire des Rythmes_; Paris, 1889) sets forth the"
4702,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,remarkable opinion that the Germans derived their alliteration from the
4703,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Romans. ""We must remember,"" he says, ""the schools of rhetoric existing"
4704,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"in Gaul in the sixth and seventh centuries, where alliteration seems to"
4705,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,have been held in esteem.... It became more and more frequent in the
4706,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Latin poetry of the Carlovingian period, and it will suffice to cite"
4707,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,here the following verses from Milo of Saint Amand:

4713,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4714,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"It early passed to Ireland, and the Irish made use of it in their Latin"
4715,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,poetry and in their national poetry. The example of the Irish was
4716,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"followed by the Anglo-Saxons, although these last had derived the same"
4717,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"rules from the Latin writers.... The Anglo-Saxons, who sent the second"
4718,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"series of apostles to the Germans, taught them the use of alliteration"
4719,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"in poetry. The Scandinavians, on their side, learned it also from the"

4721,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,Kawczynski's illustrations are probably most useful in emphasizing the

4847,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Full rime, or end-rime, involves the principally stressed vowel in the"
4848,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"riming word, and all that follows that vowel. When there is an entire"
4849,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"unstressed syllable following, the rime is called double, or feminine."
4850,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Triple rime is also recognized, though rare.[11] End-rime being a"
4851,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"stranger to the early Germanic languages, its appearance in any of them"
4852,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"may commonly be taken as a sign of foreign influence. In general, of"
4853,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"course, rime and the stanza were introduced together into English verse,"
4854,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,under the influence of Latin hymns and French lyrics.
4855,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4856,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,The functions of rime in English verse may perhaps be grouped under
4857,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"three heads: the function of emphasis, the function of forming beautiful"
4858,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"or pleasurable sounds, and the function of combining or organizing the"
4859,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,verses. It is with reference to the first of these that Professor Corson
4860,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"speaks of rime as ""an enforcing agency of the individual verse."" Under"
4861,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"the second head rime is considered simply as a form of tone-color, and"
4862,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"as furnishing a part of the melody of verse. The third function, by"
4863,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"which individual verses are bound into stanzas, is, in a sense, the most"
4864,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,important.
4865,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4866,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"On the subject of the æsthetic values of rime, see the chapter on"
4867,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"""poetic unities"" in Corson's _Primer of English Verse_, and Ehrenfeld's"
4868,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"_Studien zur Theorie des Reims_ (Zürich, 1897). The problem of the"
4869,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,relative values of rimed and unrimed verse will come up in connection
4870,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,with the history of the heroic couplet and of blank verse. The objection
4871,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,always urged against rime is that its demands are likely to turn the
4872,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"poet aside from the normal order of his ideas. Herder, as Ehrenfeld"
4873,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"points out, thought that this was particularly true of English verse,"
4874,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the uninflected language not providing so naturally for cases where
4875,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,thought and sound are parallel. A recent protest against the tyranny of
4876,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"rime is found in the article by Mr. Larminie, cited on page 115, where"
4877,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,it is claimed that undue attention to form is thinning out the substance
4878,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"of modern poetry, and that the demands of rime should be relaxed. See"
4879,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"also Ben Jonson's ""Fit of Rhyme against Rhyme,"" for a humorous complaint"
4880,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,against the requirements of rime upon the poet.
4881,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4882,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,The origin of rime has been a subject of prolonged controversy. See
4883,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the monograph by Ehrenfeld already cited; Meyer's _Anfang und
4884,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Ursprung der rythmischen Dichtung_ (Munich, 1884); W. Grimm's"

4888,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Braune's _Beiträge_, vol. ix. p. 422; and Schipper, vol. i. pp. 34"
4889,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,ff. Meyer's work is an exposition of the theory that rime was an
4890,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"importation from the Orient. In like manner, it has been held by"
4891,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,many that the poetry of Otfried (the first regularly rimed German
4892,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"verse) was produced under Latin influence wholly, and that rime was"
4893,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"introduced by him to the Germans (see the work by Kawczynski, cited"
4894,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,p. 117). Herder (see Ehrenfeld's monograph) regarded rime as a
4895,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"natural growth of the instinct for symmetry in all human taste,"
4896,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"closely connected with dance-rhythms, all forms of parallelism, and"
4897,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"the like. Similarity of inflectional endings in similar clauses, he"
4898,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"pointed out, would naturally develop rime in any inflected"
4899,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,language. This view is in line with the tendency of recent opinion.
4900,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Schipper says, in effect: ""Is rime to be regarded as the invention"
4901,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"of a special people, like the Arabian, or is it a form of art which"
4902,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"developed in the poetic language of the Aryan peoples, separately"
4903,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,in the several nations? In the opinion of the principal scholars
4904,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the latter opinion is the correct one. The chief support of this
4905,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"opinion is the fact that traces of rime, in greater or less number,"
4906,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,appear in the oldest poetry of almost all the partially civilized
4907,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"peoples. 'It is,' says C. F. Meyer, 'something inborn, original,"
4908,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"universally human, like poetry and music, and no more than these"
4909,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the special invention of a single people or a particular time.' In
4910,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"fact, traces of rime may be noticed in the poetry of the Greeks, in"
4911,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Homer, Æschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, as also in the poetry of"
4912,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the Romans; in a more developed form it appears in the late middle
4913,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Latin clerical poetry. In the Celtic languages, moreover, rime is"
4914,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"the indispensable mark of the poetic form, even in the oldest"
4915,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,extant specimens. The Latin poetry just referred to gives
4916,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,interesting evidence that rime is a characteristic sign of popular
4917,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"poetry. While the quantitative system became dominant, with the"
4918,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"artistic verse-forms of the Greeks, in the Golden Age of Roman"
4919,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"literature, the early Saturnian verses, written in free rhythms,"
4920,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,already showed the popular taste for similarity of sound in the
4921,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"form of alliteration; and in the post-classical time, with the fall"
4922,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"of the quantitative metres, rime again came to the front in songs"
4923,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,intended for the people. The same element was made so essential a
4924,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"characteristic in the organization of verse in the mediæval Latin,"
4925,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"that 'carmen rhythmicum' came to signify a rimed poem, and the"
4926,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,later Latinists used the word 'rhythmus' precisely in the sense of
4927,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"'rime.'"""
4928,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4929,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,Schipper goes on to inquire whether this mediæval Latin poetry was
4930,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the means of introducing rime to the Germanic peoples. Wackernagel
4931,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,held it as certain that Otfried learned his rimes from Latin poems;
4932,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,but as Otfried declares that his poetry is intended to take the
4933,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"place of useless popular songs, it seems probable that he was not"
4934,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"using an innovation, and that rime was already popular in Old High"
4935,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"German. Indeed, it appears sporadically in the _Hildebrandslied_"
4936,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,and the _Heliand_. Grimm observes that it is theoretically unlikely
4937,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,that alliteration should have vanished suddenly and rime as
4938,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,suddenly have taken its place. The gradual development of rime from
4939,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,assonance among the Romance peoples suggests the same thing. The
4940,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,early appearance of rime by the side of alliteration is illustrated
4941,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"by C. F. Meyer (_Historische Studien_, Leipzig, 1851) from the"
4942,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Norse _Edda_, from _Beowulf_, Cædmon, etc. In the later Anglo-Saxon"
4943,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,period rime was evidently securing a considerable though uncertain
4944,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,hold. The Riming Poem suggests what development rime might have had
4945,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,in English without the incoming of Romance influences. Grimm
4946,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"observes that, while to his mind alliteration was a finer and"
4947,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"nobler quality than rime, there was need of a stronger"
4948,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,sound-likeness which should hold the attention more firmly by its
4949,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"unchanging place at the end of the line. Schipper remarks, finally,"
4950,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,that the fact that the use of rime in connection with alliteration
4951,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"was especially popular in the southern half of England, where the"
4952,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"Romance influence was strongest, may suggest why in the more purely"
4953,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,Germanic northern half alliteration remained the single support of
4954,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,the poetic form well into the fifteenth century.
4955,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
4956,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"The appendix to the work of Norden, cited above, is a fuller"
4957,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,development of ideas frequently suggested by the sporadic
4958,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,appearance of rime in early Greek and Latin literature. Norden
4959,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"gives many examples of this ""rhetorical rime,"" as well as of rime"
4960,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,arising naturally from parallelism of sentence structure found in
4961,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"primitive charms, incantations, and the like. In particular he"
4962,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,emphasizes the influence of the figure of _hom[oe]oteleuton_ as
4963,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,used in the literary prose of the classical languages. His
4964,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"conclusion is as follows: ""Rime, then, was potentially as truly"
4965,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"present in the Greek and Latin languages, from the earliest times,"
4966,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,as in every other language; but in the metrical (quantitative)
4967,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"poetry it had no regular place, and appeared there in general only"
4968,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"sporadically and by chance, being used by only a few poets as a"
4969,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,rhetorical ornament. It became actual by the transition from the
4970,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"metrical poetry to the rhythmical (that is, the syllable-counting,"
4971,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,in which--in the Latin--the chief consideration is still for the
4972,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,word-accent); and this transition was consummated by the aid of the
4973,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"highly poetic prose, already used for centuries, which was"
4974,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"constructed according to the laws of rhythm, and in which the"
4975,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,rhetorical hom[oe]oteleuton had gained an ever-increasing
4976,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"significance. In particular, rime found an entrance through sermons"
4977,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"composed in such prose, and delivered in a voice closely"
4978,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"approaching that of singing, into the hymn-poetry which was"
4979,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,intimately related to such sermons. From the Latin hymn-poetry it
4980,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"was carried into other languages, from the ninth century onward. It"
4981,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,is self-evident that in these languages also rime was potentially
4982,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,present before it became actual through the influence of foreign
4983,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,poetry; for in this region also there operates the highest immanent
4984,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"law of every being and every form of development,--that in the"
4985,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"whole field of life nothing absolutely new is invented, but merely"

5120,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,are the unquestioned masters. Professor Corson observes that the double
5121,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"rime is to be regarded as the means of ""some special emphasis,"" whether"
5122,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"serious or humorous. More commonly the effect is humorous, of course, as"
5123,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"in _Don Juan_, where the rimes indicate ""the lowering of the poetic"
5124,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"key--the reduction of true poetic seriousness."" The rimes in the _Flight"
5125,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"of the Duchess_ Mr. Edmund Gurney has said sometimes ""produce the"
5126,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"effect of jokes made during the performance of a symphony."" The specimen"
5127,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,which follows illustrates the use of these double and triple rimes for a
5128,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,wholly serious purpose. Professor Corson remarks that in this case the
5129,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"rime serves ""as a most effective foil to the melancholy theme. It is not"
5130,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"unlike the laughter of frenzied grief."" It is interesting to note that"
5131,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"in the Italian language, where double rimes are almost constant,"
5132,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,masculine rimes are sometimes used for grotesque effect in the same way
5133,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,that English poets use the feminine.

5206,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,
5207,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,Internal rime may be regarded on the one side as only a matter of the
5208,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"division of the verse, since if it occurs regularly at the medial"
5209,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"cesura, it practically breaks the verse into two parts. On the other"
5210,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"side, if used only sporadically, it is a matter of tone-color. It"
5211,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"sometimes appears, however, in forms which entitle it to recognition by"
5212,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"itself. The earliest of these forms is the ""Leonine rime,"" which is said"
5213,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"to have taken its name from Leoninus of St. Victor, who in the twelfth"
5214,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,century wrote elegiacs (hexameters and pentameters) in which the
5215,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,syllable preceding the cesura regularly rimed with the final syllable.
5216,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,Obviously lines of this kind would easily break up into riming
5217,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"half-lines. Similarly, in septenary verse internal rime was often used"
5218,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,"together with end-rime, with a resulting resolution into short-line"
5219,A. AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT,stanzas riming either _aabb_ or _abab_.[14] The following specimen from

5327,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),some measure the ideas to be conveyed by means of the very sounds
5328,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"employed. Sometimes this takes the form of alliteration, differing from"
5329,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),that of early English verse only in that it follows no regular
5330,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"structural laws. On the other hand, it may take the form of"

5333,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"_splash_, and the like. The term Tone-color is formed by analogy with"
5334,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"the German _Klangfarbe_, an expression apparently due to the feeling"
5335,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),that the sound-qualities of speech have somewhat the same function as

5353,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"trepidation, as in ""Double, double, toil and trouble."" _R_ suggests"
5354,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"harsh, grating, or rattling noises; the sibilants are appropriate"

5356,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"because of the compression of the lips, suggest muscular effort;"
5357,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),"_st_, from a sudden stopping of the _s_, suggests fear or surprise;"

5372,B. AS A SPORADIC ELEMENT (TONE-COLOR),A. W. Schlegel went even farther in suggesting a subtle symbolism in

5834,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"The earliest English verse, like early Germanic verse generally, is"
5835,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"based on the recurrence of strong accents, and is composed of a long"
5836,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"line made up of two short lines, or half-lines, which are bound together"
5837,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"by alliteration. As to the number of accents to be counted in the line,"
5838,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"there are two theories, the ""two-accent"" and the ""four-accent."""
5839,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"According to the first, we should count two accents to the half-line,"
5840,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"and four to the long line; according to the second, we should count four"
5841,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,to the half-line and eight to the long line. The distinction is not so
5842,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"marked, however, as would appear at first thought; for the two-accent"
5843,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,theorists recognize a considerable number of secondary accents in
5844,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"addition to the principal ones, while the four-accent theorists"
5845,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,recognize half the accents as being commonly weaker than the other half.

5860,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"trans. Kennedy, vol. i. pp. 21, 22.) The principal representative"
5861,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"of the two-accent theory is Sievers, whose conclusions have been"
5862,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,pretty generally accepted by English and American scholars. He
5863,A.--NON-SYLLABLE-COUNTING,"admits that very many, perhaps most, Anglo-Saxon lines can be read"

6174,B.--SYLLABLE-COUNTING (OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET),"the French verse of Wace and his contemporaries, it is obvious that"
6175,B.--SYLLABLE-COUNTING (OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET),in English the influence of the Latin and the French poetry would
6176,B.--SYLLABLE-COUNTING (OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET),"very naturally be fused, with no necessarily clear conception of"
6177,B.--SYLLABLE-COUNTING (OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET),"definite verse-structure. Whether under French or Latin influence,"
6178,B.--SYLLABLE-COUNTING (OCTOSYLLABIC COUPLET),"however, the new tendency was for the more accurate counting of"

6725,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6726,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,With Chaucer we have the first deliberate use of the five-stress
6727,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"couplet, in continuous verse, known to English poetry. His earliest use"
6728,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,of the pentameter line was in the _Compleynt to Pitee_ (perhaps written
6729,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"about 1371), in the ""rime royal"" stanza; his earliest use of the"
6730,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"pentameter couplet was in the _Legend of Good Women_, usually dated"
6731,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"1385. From that time the measure became almost his only instrument, and"
6732,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"we find altogether in his poetry some 16,000 lines in the couplet,"
6733,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"besides some 14,000 more in rime royal. Too much praise cannot be given"
6734,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Chaucer's use of the couplet. Although it was an experiment in English
6735,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"verse, it has perhaps hardly been used since his time with greater"
6736,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,skill. He used a variety of cesuras (see ten Brink's monograph for the
6737,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"enumeration of them), a very large number of feminine endings (such as"
6738,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"the still pronounced final-_e_ and similar syllables easily provided),"
6739,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"free inversions in the first foot and elsewhere, and many run-on lines"
6740,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,(in a typical 100 lines some 16 run-on lines and 7 run-on couplets
6741,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"appearing). The total effect is one of combined freedom and mastery, of"
6742,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,fluent conversational style yet within the limits of guarded artistic
6743,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"form. ""Much more regularly than the French and Provençals, and yet"
6744,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"without pedantic stiffness, he made his verse advance with a sort of"
6745,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"iambic gait, and he was therefore able to give up and exchange for a"
6746,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"freer arrangement the immovable cesura, which these poets had always"
6747,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"made to coincide with a foot-ending."" (Ten Brink, in _English"

6751,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6752,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"The common assumption is, that Chaucer borrowed the pentameter"
6753,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,couplet directly from French poetry. On the history of this in
6754,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"France, see Stengel, in Gröber's _Grundriss der Romanischen"
6755,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Philologie_.[20] The decasyllabic verse was fairly common in France
6756,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"in the fourteenth century (being called ""_vers commun_"" according to"
6757,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Stengel); but in the form of the couplet it was not. Professor
6758,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Skeat says: ""To say that it [Chaucer's couplet] was derived from the"
6759,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,French ten-syllable verse is not a complete solution of the mystery;
6760,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"for nearly all such verse is commonly either in stanzas, or else a"
6761,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"great number of successive lines are rimed together; and these, I"
6762,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"believe, are rather scarce. After some search I have, however,"
6763,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"fortunately lighted upon a very interesting specimen, among the"
6764,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"poems of Guillaume de Machault, a French writer whom Chaucer is"
6765,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"known to have imitated, and who died in 1377. In the edition of"
6766,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Machault's poems edited by Tarbé, Reims and Paris, 1849, p. 89,"
6767,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"there is a poem of exactly this character, of no great length, but"
6768,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,fortunately dated; for its title is 'Complainte écrite après la
6769,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,bataille de Poitiers et avant le siège de Reims par les Anglais'
6770,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,(1356-1358). The first four lines run thus:
6771,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6772,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""'A toy, Henry, dous amis, me complain,"
6773,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Pour ce que ne cueur ne mont ne plein;
6774,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Car a piet suy, sans cheval et sans selle,"
6775,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Et si n'ay mais esmeraude, ne belle.'"
6776,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6777,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"... Now as Chaucer was taken prisoner in France in 1359, he had an"
6778,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"excellent opportunity for making himself acquainted with this poem,"
6779,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"and with others, possibly, in a similar metre, which have not come"
6780,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"down to us."" (_The Prioress's Tale_, Introduction, pp. xix, xx.)"
6781,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Paris has shown that the real date of the poem in question was
6782,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,1340; the title quoted by Skeat is Tarbé's modern French caption.
6783,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Professor Kittredge has called my attention to the fact that there
6784,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,is another poem of Machault's in the same metre (P. Paris's edition
6785,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"of _Voir-Dit_, p. 56), and also a poem by Froissart, the ""Orloge"
6786,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Amoureus."""
6787,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6788,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Ten Brink calls attention to the possibility of the influence upon
6789,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Chaucer's couplet of the Italian hendecasyllabic verse. The
6790,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"_Compleynte to Pitee_, it is true, was written probably before the"
6791,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Italian journey of 1372-1373; but in Italy the ""full significance"""
6792,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"of the metre may have become clear to Chaucer. ""After that journey"
6793,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,the heroic verse appears almost exclusively as his poetic
6794,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,instrument.... Of still greater significance is the fact that
6795,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Chaucer's heroic verse differs from the French decasyllabic in all
6796,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,the particulars in which the Italian hendecasyllabic departs from
6797,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"the common source, and approaches the verse of Dante and Boccaccio"
6798,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,as closely as the metre of a Germanic language can approach a
6799,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Romance metre. It may be added also that the heroic verse in the
6800,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,_Compleynte to Pitee_ stands nearer the French decasyllabic than
6801,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"that of the _Troilus_ or the _Canterbury Tales_."""
6802,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6803,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Dr. Lewis, on the other hand, in _The Foreign Sources of English"
6804,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Versification_, would minimize the foreign sources of Chaucer's"
6805,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,couplet. Not only the unaccentual character of the French verse is
6806,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"opposed to the theory of the French source, but also, he believes,"
6807,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"the fixed cesura. ""In the English verse there is no such thing:"
6808,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"indeed there is no cesura at all, in the French sense of the"
6809,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,word.... Schipper relegates to a foot-note the suggestion that our
6810,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"heroic verse may have originated in a different way, either through"
6811,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,an abridgment of the alexandrine or through an extension of the
6812,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"four-foot line. This is of course more nearly the true view, but it"
6813,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,is entirely immaterial which of the last two explanations we hit
6814,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"upon. Accentual verses of four, six, and seven feet were already"
6815,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,familiar long before Chaucer's time. They exhibited a more or less
6816,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,regular alternation of arsis and thesis. To devise a verse which
6817,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"should be essentially the same in principle, but should have five"
6818,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"accents instead of four, six, or seven, was a task that Chaucer's"
6819,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"genius might well achieve unaided"" (pp. 98, 99)."
6820,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6821,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,It is quite possible that a combination of all these views may be
6822,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,nearest the truth. The objection to the French influence on the
6823,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,ground of the syllabic (non-accentual) quality of the French verse
6824,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"does not seem to be serious, since any imitation of French verse by"
6825,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"an Englishman would be likely to take on the accentual form; and,"
6826,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"that once done, the need for the fixed cesura would vanish. But it"
6827,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,is worth while to emphasize the fact that the genius of English
6828,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,verse was not so averse to the formation of a decasyllabic
6829,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,five-stress line as to make it a serious innovation. This view is
6830,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,further emphasized by the next specimen.

6933,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
6934,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Joseph Hall was the most vigorous satirist of the group of Elizabethans
6935,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"who, in the last decade of the sixteenth century, were imitating the"
6936,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"satires of Horace, Juvenal, and Persius. Hall's satires have a curiously"
6937,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"eighteenth-century flavor, and his couplets are frequently very similar"
6938,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,to those of the age of Pope. Thus Thomas Warton (in his _History of
6939,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"English Poetry_) observed of Hall that ""the fabric of the couplets"
6940,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"approaches to the modern standard;"" and Anderson, who edited the"
6941,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"_British Poets_ in 1795, said: ""Many of his lines would do honor to the"
6942,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,most harmonious of our modern poets. The sense has generally such a

6952,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"that of the Elizabethan satires in general. Dryden said: ""Would not"

6998,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"run-on lines, it yet differs in quality from that of satires. The"

7051,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,of the later couplet of Waller and Dryden: end-stopped lines and
7052,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"couplets, a preference for medial cesura, and an antithetical structure"

7099,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7100,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Edmund Waller is the chief representative of the early classical poetry
7101,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"of the seventeenth century, and of the polishing and regulating of the"
7102,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,couplet which prepared the way for the verse of Dryden and Pope. The
7103,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"dominant characteristic of this verse is its avoidance of _enjambement_,"
7104,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"or run-on lines, still more of run-on couplets. The growing precision of"
7105,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,French verse at the same time was perhaps influential in England.
7106,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Malherbe, who was at the French court after 1605, set rules for more"
7107,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"regular verse, and forbade, among other things, the use of run-on"
7108,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,lines--a precept which held good in French poetry until the nineteenth
7109,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"century. The influence of Waller in England was, for a considerable"
7110,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"period, hardly less than that of Malherbe in France. Dryden said that"
7111,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""the excellence and dignity"" of rime ""were never known till Mr. Waller"
7112,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,taught it; he first made writing easily an art; first showed us to
7113,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"conclude the sense most commonly in distichs, which, in the verse of"
7114,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"those before him, runs on for so many lines together that the reader is"
7115,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,out of breath to overtake it. This sweetness of Mr. Waller's lyric poesy
7116,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"was afterward followed, in the epic, by Sir John Denham, in his"
7117,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"_Cooper's Hill_."" (Epistle Dedicatory of _The Rival Ladies_.) In another"
7118,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"place Dryden observed that only Waller, in English, had surpassed"
7119,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Spenser in the harmony of his verse. Dryden's view was later echoed by
7120,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Pope, who exhorted his readers to"
7121,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7122,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""praise the easy vigor of a line"
7123,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Where Denham's strength and Waller's sweetness join."""
7124,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,

7126,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7127,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,But the most remarkable praise of Waller is found in the Preface to his
7128,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"posthumous poems, 1690, generally attributed to Bishop Atterbury. ""He"
7129,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"was indeed the parent of English verse, and the first that shewed us our"
7130,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,tongue had beauty and numbers in it.... The tongue came into his hands
7131,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"like a rough diamond; he polished it first, and to that degree that all"
7132,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"artists since him have admired the workmanship, without pretending to"
7133,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"mend it.... He undoubtedly stands first in the list of refiners, and for"
7134,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"aught I know, last, too; for I question whether in Charles the Second's"
7135,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,reign English did not come to its full perfection; and whether it has
7136,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"not had its Augustan Age, as well as the Latin.... We are no less"
7137,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"beholding to him for the new turn of verse, which he brought in, and the"
7138,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"improvement he made in our numbers. Before his time men rhymed, indeed,"
7139,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"and that was all: as for the harmony of measure, and that dance of words"
7140,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"which good ears are so much pleased with, they knew nothing of it. Their"
7141,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"poetry then was made up almost entirely of monosyllables, which, when"
7142,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"they come together in any cluster, are certainly the most harsh,"
7143,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"untunable things in the world. If any man doubts of this, let him read"
7144,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"ten lines in Donne, and he'll quickly be convinced. Besides, their"
7145,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"verses ran all into one another, and hung together, throughout a whole"
7146,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"copy, like the _hook't atoms_ that compose a body in Des Cartes. There"
7147,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"was no distinction of parts, no regular stops, nothing for the ear to"
7148,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"rest upon. But as soon as the copy began, down it went like a larum,"
7149,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,incessantly; and the reader was sure to be out of breath before he got
7150,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,to the end of it. So that really verse in those days was but downright
7151,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"prose, tagged with rhymes. Mr. Waller removed all these faults, brought"
7152,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"in more polysyllables and smoother measures, bound up his thoughts"
7153,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,better and in a cadence more agreeable to the nature of the verse he
7154,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"wrote in: so that wherever the natural stops of that were, he contrived"
7155,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,the little breakings of his sense so as to fall in with 'em. And for
7156,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"that reason, since the stress of our verse lies commonly upon the last"
7157,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"syllable, you'll hardly ever find him using a word of no force"
7158,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"there.""[21] Waller's editor thus clearly discerns the very"
7159,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,characteristics of his verse which are avoided by the master-poets--the
7160,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"coincidence of phrase-pauses and verse-pauses, and regularity in the"
7161,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,placing of stress.
7162,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7163,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,The most important discussion of the influence of Waller on English
7164,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"poetry, and on the heroic couplet in particular, is found in Mr. Gosse's"
7165,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"book, _From Shakespeare to Pope_. Mr. Gosse regards Waller as inventing"
7166,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"for himself the couplet of the classical school; ""master,"" in 1623, of"
7167,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"such verse as ""was not imitated by a single poet for nearly twenty"
7168,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"years"" (p. 50). This view is criticised in an interesting article by Dr."
7169,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Henry Wood, in the _American Journal of Philology_, vol. xi. p. 55."
7170,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"While Mr. Gosse places Waller's earliest couplets in 1621 and 1623, Dr."
7171,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Wood would date them as late as 1626, and shows that Waller wrote"
7172,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,nothing else until 1635. Meantime had appeared (the first volume at
7173,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"least as early as 1623) the translation of Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, by"
7174,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"George Sandys, in which, says Wood, all the characteristics of Waller's"
7175,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"verse appear. ""At all events,"" is his conclusion, ""it was Sandys, and"
7176,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"not Waller, who at the beginning of the third decade of the century,"
7177,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"first of all Englishmen, made a uniform practice of writing in heroic"
7178,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"couplets, which are, on the whole, in accord with the French rule, and"
7179,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"which, for exactness of construction, and for harmonious sification, go"
7180,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,far towards satisfying the demands of the later 'classical' school in
7181,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"England."" Dr. Wood emphasizes the probable influence of the French poets"
7182,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"on these early heroic couplets, calling attention to the fact that"
7183,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Sandys was in France in 1610. There is no evidence, however, that he was"
7184,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"there for more than a few days, _en route_ to more eastern countries."
7185,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Waller was not in France till 1643. The whole question of the influence
7186,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,of French poetry in England before the Restoration still remains to be
7187,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"carefully investigated. Meantime, the cautious student will hesitate to"
7188,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,put too much stress on any single point of departure for the new style
7189,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,of versification. Many influences must have combined to make it popular.
7190,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,We have seen Professor Schelling emphasizing the influence of Jonson; he
7191,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"also very justly points out ""that it is a mistake to consider that the"
7192,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Elizabethans often practised the couplet with the freedom, not to say"
7193,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"license, that characterizes its nineteenth century use in the hands of"
7194,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"such poets as Keats."" Compare the couplets of even so romantic a poet as"
7195,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Marlowe, in the specimen given above from _Hero and Leander_. And even"
7196,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Mr. Gosse, in partial divergence from the doctrines of _From Shakespeare"
7197,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"to Pope_, says of the satiric verse of the Elizabethan Rowlands: ""There"
7198,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,are lines in this passage which Pope would not have disdained to use. It
7199,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"might, indeed, be employed as against that old heresy, not even yet"
7200,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"entirely discarded, that smoothness of heroic verse was the invention of"
7201,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Waller. As a matter of fact, this, as well as all other branches of the"
7202,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"universal art of poetry, was understood by the great Elizabethan"
7203,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"masters; and if they did not frequently employ it, it was because they"
7204,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,left to such humbler writers as Rowlands an instrument incapable of
7205,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,those noble and audacious harmonies on which they chiefly prided
7206,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"themselves."" (Introduction to the _Works of Rowlands_, Hunterian Club"

7208,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7209,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,A tribute to the incoming influence of the couplet is cited by Dr. Wood
7210,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,from the poems of Sir John Beaumont (1582-1627). In his verses _To His

7330,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"couplet his chief vehicle of expression, and he put far more variety and"
7331,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,vigor into it than had been achieved by his nearer predecessors. As Pope
7332,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,said:
7333,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7334,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join"
7335,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"The varying verse, the full resounding line,"

7350,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,whole structure of the decasyllabic line before the middle of the
7351,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,seventeenth century was ill calculated for the perfecting of the
7352,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"couplet. Accustomed either to the stately plainness of blank verse, or"
7353,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"to the elaborate intricacies of the stanza, writers had got into the"
7354,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,habit of communicating to their verse a slow and somewhat languid
7355,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"movement."" (p. 17.) ""In versification the great achievement of Dryden"
7356,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"was the alteration of what may be called the balance of the line,"
7357,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"causing it to run more quickly, and to strike its rhymes with a sharper"
7358,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"and less prolonged sound. One obvious means of obtaining this was, as a"
7359,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"matter of course, the isolation of the couplet, and the avoidance of"
7360,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,overlapping the different lines one upon the other. The effect of this
7361,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"overlapping, by depriving the eye and voice of the expectation of rest"
7362,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"at the end of each couplet, is always one of two things. Either the"
7363,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"lines are converted into a sort of rhythmic prose, made musical by the"
7364,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"rhymes rather than divided by them, or else a considerable pause is"
7365,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"invited at the end of each, or of most lines, and the cadence of the"
7366,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"whole becomes comparatively slow and languid. Both these forms, as may"
7367,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"be seen in the works of Mr. Morris, as well as in the older writers, are"
7368,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,excellently suited for narration of some considerable length. They are
7369,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"less well suited for satire, for argument, and for the moral reflections"
7370,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,which the age of Dryden loved. He therefore set himself to elaborate the
7371,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"couplet with its sharp point, its quick delivery, and the pistol-like"
7372,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"detonation of its rhyme. But there is an obvious objection, or rather"
7373,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,there are several obvious objections which present themselves to the
7374,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,couplet. It was natural that to one accustomed to the more varied range
7375,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"of the older rhythm and metre, there might seem to be a danger of the"
7376,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"snip-snap monotony into which, as we know, it did actually fall when it"
7377,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,passed out of the hands of its first great practitioners. There might
7378,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,also be a fear that it would not always be possible to compress the
7379,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,sense of a complete clause within the narrow limits of twenty syllables.
7380,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,To meet these difficulties Dryden resorted to three mechanical
7381,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"devices--the hemistich, the alexandrine, and the triplet, all three of"
7382,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,which could be used indifferently to eke out the space or to give
7383,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,variety of sound.... In poetry proper the hemistich is anything but
7384,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"pleasing, and Dryden, becoming convinced of the fact, almost discarded"
7385,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"it. The alexandrine and the triplet he always continued to use."" (pp."

7411,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,The use of the heroic couplet in the drama marks its effort to conquer
7412,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"the last citadel of English poetry; an attempt which, under the"
7413,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"leadership of Dryden, seemed to succeed, but soon gave way to better"
7414,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,judgment. Dryden favored the experiment in the Preface to _The Rival
7415,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Ladies_ (1663), and inserted a few couplets in that play. Etheredge"
7416,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"accepted the suggestion, and put the serious parts of _The Comical"
7417,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Revenge_ (largely prose) into couplets, in 1664. In the same year _The"
7418,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Indian Queen_ (by Dryden and Sir Robert Howard) appeared in heroic
7419,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"verse, and the fashion soon became so general that in the _Essay on"
7420,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Heroic Plays_, prefixed to _The Conquest of Granada_ (1672), Dryden"
7421,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"could say: ""Whether Heroic Verse ought to be admitted into serious"
7422,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"plays, is not now to be disputed: 'tis already in possession of the"
7423,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"stage; and I dare confidently affirm, that very few tragedies, in this"
7424,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"age, shall be received without it."" Only six years later, however, in"
7425,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"1678, he returned to blank verse in _All for Love_, saying: ""I have"
7426,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"disencumbered myself from rhyme. Not that I condemn my former way, but"
7427,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"that this is more proper to my present purpose."" In all about five"
7428,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,plays of Dryden's are in couplets; after 1678 he rarely returned to rime
7429,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,for the drama. As Atterbury said in his Preface to Waller's poems:
7430,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""'Twas the strength of his genius that first brought it into credit in"
7431,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"plays; and 'tis the force of his example that has thrown it out again."""
7432,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""The fashion of rhyme in the drama, then, to be exact,"" says Mr. Gosse,"
7433,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""flourished from 1664 until ... 1678."" Some justification for its use is"
7434,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,to be found in the wretched condition into which blank verse had fallen.
7435,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"""The blank iambics of the romantic dramatists had become so execrably"
7436,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"weak and distended, the whole movement of dramatic verse had grown so"
7437,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"flaccid, that a little restraint in the severe limits of rhyme was"
7438,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"absolutely necessary."" (Gosse, in _Seventeenth Century Studies_, p."
7439,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,264.)
7440,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7441,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,The present specimen is from a play in which the couplet was used but
7442,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"slightly; but it shows Dryden's use of it at its best. In the drama, as"
7443,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"already remarked, the couplet is naturally less epigrammatic and pointed"
7444,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,than in didactic and satiric verse.
7445,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7446,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,For the arguments with which Dryden defended the use of rime in the
7447,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"drama, see the Preface to _The Rival Ladies_, the _Essay of Heroic"
7448,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Plays_, the _Essay of Dramatic Poesy_, and the _Defence of an Essay"
7449,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"of Dramatic Poesy_. ""In the quickness of reparties (which in"
7450,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"discoursive scenes fall very often), it has so particular a grace,"
7451,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"and is so aptly suited to them, that the sudden smartness of the"
7452,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"answer, and the sweetness of the rhyme, set off the beauty of each"
7453,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"other. But that benefit which I consider most in it, because I have"
7454,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"not seldom found it, is, that it bounds and circumscribes the"
7455,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"fancy."" (_Essays of Dryden_, ed. W. P. Ker, vol. i. p. 8.) In the"
7456,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"_Essay of Dramatic Poesy_, Crites, representing Sir Robert Howard,"
7457,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,opposes the use of rime on the ground of Aristotle's dictum that
7458,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,tragedy is best written in the kind of verse which is nearest
7459,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"prose. A play being an imitation of Nature, ""the nearer anything"
7460,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"comes to the imitation of it, the more it pleases."" Neander,"
7461,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"representing Dryden, answers that this line of argument will"
7462,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"equally forbid blank verse. Blank verse is ""properly but measured"
7463,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"prose""; and rime may be ""made as natural as blank verse, by the"
7464,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"well placing of the words, etc."" ""But I need not go so far to prove"
7465,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"that rhyme, as it succeeds to all other offices of Greek and Latin"
7466,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"verse, so especially to this of plays, since the custom of all"
7467,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"nations at this day confirms it, all the French, Italian, and"
7468,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Spanish tragedies are generally writ in it; and sure the universal
7469,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"consent of the most civilized parts of the world ought in this, as"
7470,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"it doth in other customs, to include the rest."" (_Ibid._ p. 98.)"
7471,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Again, while a play is a representation of Nature, it is ""Nature"
7472,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"wrought up to an higher pitch""; and for this purpose ""heroic rhyme"
7473,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"is nearest Nature, as being the noblest kind of modern verse."" (pp."
7474,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"100, 101.) In the _Essay of Heroic Plays_ Dryden again summarizes"
7475,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"the case for the other side by saying that ""all the arguments which"
7476,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"are formed against it can amount to no more than this, that it is"
7477,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"not so near conversation as prose, and therefore not so natural."
7478,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"But it is very clear to all who understand Poetry, that serious"
7479,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"plays ought not to imitate conversation too nearly."" If, therefore,"
7480,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"we begin to leave the mere ""imitation of ordinary converse,"" we"
7481,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"should go on consistently to ""the last perfection of Art. It was"
7482,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"only custom which cozened us so long; we thought, because"
7483,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"Shakespeare and Fletcher went no farther, that there the pillars of"
7484,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"poetry were to be erected; that, because they excellently described"
7485,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"passion without rhyme, therefore rhyme was not capable of"
7486,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"describing it. But time has now convinced most men of that error."""
7487,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"(_Ibid._ pp. 148, 149.)"
7488,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7489,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,Dryden was of course quite right in objecting to the claim that
7490,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,imaginative poetry ought to seek the form closest to the language
7491,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,of real life. The real question is whether rimed verse is a more
7492,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,imaginative and highly poetic form than blank verse; modern opinion
7493,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,would unanimously answer in the negative.
7494,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,
7495,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,It strikes a modern reader as curious that Dryden and his
7496,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,contemporaries should have advocated the use of rime in tragedy
7497,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,rather than in comedy; but we have the clew to their feeling in the
7498,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"saying that ""_serious plays_ ought not to imitate conversation too"
7499,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"nearly."" In the Restoration period the comedy was thought of as a"
7500,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,realistic representation of life; hence its characters should speak
7501,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"in natural prose, as they have continued to do, for the most part,"
7502,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"ever since. The tragedy or heroic play, on the other hand, was in"
7503,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"the region of artistic convention, much farther removed from"
7504,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"reality; hence its language was to be ""raised above the life."" This"
7505,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"distinction between the range of comedy and that of tragedy, which"
7506,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,"would have seemed strange to the Elizabethans, explains the widely"
7507,A.--THE DECASYLLABIC COUPLET,diverging lines which we find the two forms of the drama following

8040,B.--BLANK VERSE,Of Mr. Symonds's remarks on the general nature of blank verse the
8041,B.--BLANK VERSE,"following are especially interesting: ""English blank verse is perhaps"
8042,B.--BLANK VERSE,more various and plastic than any other national metre. It is capable of
8043,B.--BLANK VERSE,being used for the most commonplace and the most sublime utterances....
8044,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Originally instituted for the drama, it received in Milton's hands an"
8045,B.--BLANK VERSE,"epical treatment, and has by authors of our own day been used for"
8046,B.--BLANK VERSE,idyllic and even for lyrical compositions. Plato mentions a Greek
8047,B.--BLANK VERSE,"musical instrument called _panharmonion_, which was adapted to express"
8048,B.--BLANK VERSE,the different modes and systems of melodious utterance. This name might
8049,B.--BLANK VERSE,"be applied to our blank verse; there is no harmony of sound, no dignity"
8050,B.--BLANK VERSE,"of movement, no swiftness, no subtlety of languid sweetness, no brevity,"
8051,B.--BLANK VERSE,"no force of emphasis, beyond its scope."" (_Blank Verse_, pp. 16, 17.)"
8052,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8053,B.--BLANK VERSE,"""It seems adapted specially for thought in evolution; it requires"
8054,B.--BLANK VERSE,"progression and sustained effort. As a consequence of this, its melody"
8055,B.--BLANK VERSE,"is determined by the sense which it contains, and depends more upon"
8056,B.--BLANK VERSE,proportion and harmony of sounds than upon recurrences and regularities
8057,B.--BLANK VERSE,of structure.... Another point about blank verse is that it admits of no
8058,B.--BLANK VERSE,"mediocrity; it must be either clay or gold.... Hence, we find that blank"
8059,B.--BLANK VERSE,"verse has been the metre of genius, that it is only used successfully"
8060,B.--BLANK VERSE,"by indubitable poets, and that it is no favorite in a mean, contracted,"
8061,B.--BLANK VERSE,and unimaginative age. The freedom of the renaissance created it in
8062,B.--BLANK VERSE,England. The freedom of our century has reproduced it. Blank verse is a

8234,B.--BLANK VERSE,Marlowe is universally and rightly regarded as the first English poet
8235,B.--BLANK VERSE,"who used blank verse with the hand of a master, and showed its"
8236,B.--BLANK VERSE,possibilities. With him it became practically a new measure. Mr. Symonds
8237,B.--BLANK VERSE,"says: ""He found the ten-syllabled heroic line monotonous, monosyllabic,"
8238,B.--BLANK VERSE,and divided into five feet of tolerably regular alternate short and
8239,B.--BLANK VERSE,"long. He left it various in form and structure, sometimes redundant by a"
8240,B.--BLANK VERSE,"syllable, sometimes deficient, enriched with unexpected emphases and"
8241,B.--BLANK VERSE,changes in the beat. He found no sequence or attempt at periods; one
8242,B.--BLANK VERSE,"line succeeded another with insipid regularity, and all were made after"
8243,B.--BLANK VERSE,"the same model. He grouped his verse according to the sense, obeying an"
8244,B.--BLANK VERSE,"internal law of melody, and allowing the thought contained in his words"
8245,B.--BLANK VERSE,"to dominate their form.... Used in this fashion, blank verse became a"
8246,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Proteus. It resembled music, which requires regular time and rhythm;"
8247,B.--BLANK VERSE,"but, by the employment of phrase, induces a higher kind of melody to"
8248,B.--BLANK VERSE,"rise above the common and despotic beat of time.... It is true that,"
8249,B.--BLANK VERSE,"like all great poets, he left his own peculiar imprint on it, and that"
8250,B.--BLANK VERSE,"his metre is marked by an almost extravagant exuberance, impetuosity,"
8251,B.--BLANK VERSE,"and height of coloring."" (_Blank Verse_, pp. 22-27.) In the earlier"
8252,B.--BLANK VERSE,"verse of _Tamburlaine_, while showing these new qualities of a metrical"
8253,B.--BLANK VERSE,"master, Marlowe yet kept pretty closely to the individual, end-stopped"
8254,B.--BLANK VERSE,"line; in his later verse, as illustrated in the fragmentary text of"
8255,B.--BLANK VERSE,"_Faustus_, he seems to have attained much more freedom, resembling that"
8256,B.--BLANK VERSE,of the later plays of Shakspere.[28]

8324,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8325,B.--BLANK VERSE,No attempt can be made to represent adequately the blank verse of
8326,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Shakspere. The specimens, chosen respectively from his earlier, middle,"
8327,B.--BLANK VERSE,"and later periods, illustrate the trend of development of his verse. In"
8328,B.--BLANK VERSE,the earlier period it was characterized by the slight use of feminine
8329,B.--BLANK VERSE,"endings and _enjambement_; in the later by marked preference for both,"
8330,B.--BLANK VERSE,"and by general freedom and flexibility. In other words, Shakspere's own"
8331,B.--BLANK VERSE,"development represents, in a sort of miniature, that of the history of"
8332,B.--BLANK VERSE,"dramatic blank verse. According to Furnivall's tables, the proportion of"
8333,B.--BLANK VERSE,run-on lines to end-stopped lines in _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ is
8334,B.--BLANK VERSE,"one in ten, while in _The Tempest_ it is one in three. The increased use"
8335,B.--BLANK VERSE,"of ""light"" and ""weak"" endings is closely analogous. Professor Wendell"
8336,B.--BLANK VERSE,"says of the verse of _Cymbeline_: ""End-stopped lines are so deliberately"
8337,B.--BLANK VERSE,avoided that one feels a sense of relief when a speech and a line end
8338,B.--BLANK VERSE,together. Such a phrase as
8339,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8340,B.--BLANK VERSE,"'How slow his soul sail'd on, how swift his ship'"
8341,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8342,B.--BLANK VERSE,"is deliberately made, not a single line, but two half-lines. Several"
8343,B.--BLANK VERSE,"times, in the broken dialogue, one has literally to count the syllables"
8344,B.--BLANK VERSE,before the metrical regularity of the verse appears.... Clearly this
8345,B.--BLANK VERSE,puzzling style is decadent; the distinction between verse and prose is
8346,B.--BLANK VERSE,"breaking down."" (_William Shakspere_, p. 357.)[29]"

8472,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8473,B.--BLANK VERSE,Middleton carried on the work of fitting blank verse for plausibly
8474,B.--BLANK VERSE,"conversational, as distinguished from poetic, effects. Often his lines"
8475,B.--BLANK VERSE,"are more difficult to scan than Fletcher's, and still less seek"
8476,B.--BLANK VERSE,melodiousness for its own sake. Characteristic specimens are verses like
8477,B.--BLANK VERSE,these:

8537,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8538,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Massinger's verse is more regular than that of Fletcher and others, in"
8539,B.--BLANK VERSE,"the matter of extra final syllables and the like, but free and flexible"
8540,B.--BLANK VERSE,in the use of run-on lines and generally progressive movement.[31] It is
8541,B.--BLANK VERSE,an error to assume that there was no good blank verse written in this
8542,B.--BLANK VERSE,period when the drama in general is said to have been in a state of
8543,B.--BLANK VERSE,"""decadence."" The verse of Ford, for example, is noticeably strong and"
8544,B.--BLANK VERSE,"restrained (compare the remark of Mr. Symonds, on its ""glittering"
8545,B.--BLANK VERSE,"regularity""). On the other hand, one may see the dramas of Richard Brome"
8546,B.--BLANK VERSE,for specimens of the decadent metre at its worst. Brome wrote comedies
8547,B.--BLANK VERSE,"both in prose and verse, and there is little difference between the two"
8548,B.--BLANK VERSE,forms in his hands. See also the crude and lax verse of some of the
8549,B.--BLANK VERSE,"early plays of Dryden, illustrated on p. 234 below. It was verse of this"
8550,B.--BLANK VERSE,"kind which, as Mr. Gosse observes, justified the introduction of the"

8608,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8609,B.--BLANK VERSE,The blank verse of Milton is characterized by greater freedom and
8610,B.--BLANK VERSE,flexibility than that of any earlier poet. The single line practically
8611,B.--BLANK VERSE,"ceases to be the unit of the verse, which is divided rather into"
8612,B.--BLANK VERSE,"metrical paragraphs, or, as some would even call them, stanzas."
8613,B.--BLANK VERSE,Professor Corson quotes an interesting passage from a letter of
8614,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Coleridge, giving an account of a conversation in which Wordsworth"
8615,B.--BLANK VERSE,"expressed his view of this sort of blank verse. ""My friend gave his"
8616,B.--BLANK VERSE,"definition and notion of harmonious verse, that it consisted (the"
8617,B.--BLANK VERSE,English iambic blank verse above all) in the apt arrangement of pauses
8618,B.--BLANK VERSE,"and cadences, and the sweep of whole paragraphs,"
8619,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8620,B.--BLANK VERSE,with many a winding bout
8621,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Of linked sweetness long drawn out,"
8622,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8623,B.--BLANK VERSE,"and not in the even flow, much less in the prominence or antithetic"
8624,B.--BLANK VERSE,"vigor of single lines, which were indeed injurious to the total effect,"
8625,B.--BLANK VERSE,"except where they were introduced for some specific purpose."" (Corson's"
8626,B.--BLANK VERSE,"_Primer of English Verse_, p. 218.) In like manner Mr. Symonds says:"
8627,B.--BLANK VERSE,"""The most sonorous passages begin and end with interrupted lines,"
8628,B.--BLANK VERSE,"including in one organic structure, periods, parentheses, and paragraphs"
8629,B.--BLANK VERSE,of fluent melody.... In these structures there are many pauses which
8630,B.--BLANK VERSE,"enable the ear and voice to rest themselves, but none are perfect, none"
8631,B.--BLANK VERSE,"satisfy the want created by the opening hemistich, until the final and"
8632,B.--BLANK VERSE,"deliberate close is reached."" (_Blank Verse_ pp. 56, 57.)"
8633,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8634,B.--BLANK VERSE,"In Milton's own prefatory note to _Paradise Lost_, he called his blank"
8635,B.--BLANK VERSE,"verse ""English heroic verse without rime."" Rime he spoke of as ""the"
8636,B.--BLANK VERSE,"invention of a barbarous age, ... graced indeed since by the use of some"
8637,B.--BLANK VERSE,"famous modern poets,""--not least among them, he might have said, being"
8638,B.--BLANK VERSE,John Milton himself. He described also the special character of his
8639,B.--BLANK VERSE,"verse in saying that ""true musical delight ... consists only in apt"
8640,B.--BLANK VERSE,"numbers, fit quantity of syllables, and the sense variously drawn out"
8641,B.--BLANK VERSE,"from one verse into another,""--that is, by _enjambement_. ""This neglect"
8642,B.--BLANK VERSE,"then of rime so little is to be taken for a defect, ... that it rather"
8643,B.--BLANK VERSE,"is to be esteemed an example set, the first in English, of ancient"
8644,B.--BLANK VERSE,liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage
8645,B.--BLANK VERSE,"of riming.""[32]"
8646,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8647,B.--BLANK VERSE,It appears from this note that Milton regarded his heroic blank verse as
8648,B.--BLANK VERSE,a different measure from the familiar dramatic blank verse. The latter
8649,B.--BLANK VERSE,"he used in _Samson Agonistes_, the verse-structure of which will be seen"
8650,B.--BLANK VERSE,to differ from that of _Paradise Lost_; the most salient distinction is
8651,B.--BLANK VERSE,the more frequent use of feminine endings. Mr. Symonds remarks
8652,B.--BLANK VERSE,"interestingly on the ""difference between Shaksperian and Miltonic,"
8653,B.--BLANK VERSE,between dramatic and epical blank verse. The one is simple in
8654,B.--BLANK VERSE,"construction and progressive, the other is complex and stationary...."
8655,B.--BLANK VERSE,"The one exhibits a thought, in the process of formation, developing"
8656,B.--BLANK VERSE,itself from the excited fancy of the speaker. The other presents to us
8657,B.--BLANK VERSE,an image crystallized and perfect in the poet's mind; the one is in
8658,B.--BLANK VERSE,"time, the other in space--the one is a growing and the other a complete"
8659,B.--BLANK VERSE,"organism.... The one, if we may play upon a fancy, resembles Music, and"
8660,B.--BLANK VERSE,"the other Architecture."" (_Blank Verse_, p. 58.)"

8692,B.--BLANK VERSE,"(DRYDEN: _All for Love_, III. i. 1678.)"
8693,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8694,B.--BLANK VERSE,The first of these specimens of Dryden's blank verse illustrates the
8695,B.--BLANK VERSE,"loose form of it found in many of the comedies, ill distinguished from"
8696,B.--BLANK VERSE,"prose and used interchangeably with prose, as in the case of the late"
8697,B.--BLANK VERSE,Jacobean dramatists. It was with _All for Love_ that Dryden dropped the
8698,B.--BLANK VERSE,"use of the rimed couplet in tragedy, and turned his hand toward the"
8699,B.--BLANK VERSE,construction of really noble blank verse. This play was professedly an
8700,B.--BLANK VERSE,"imitation of Shakspere, and the passage here quoted is a paraphrase of"
8701,B.--BLANK VERSE,"one in _Antony and Cleopatra_, II. ii. Shakspere's blank verse doubtless"
8702,B.--BLANK VERSE,"exerted a good influence on the quality of Dryden's. ""From this time"
8703,B.--BLANK VERSE,"on,"" says Mr. Gosse, ""Dryden's blank verse was more severe than any"
8704,B.--BLANK VERSE,"which had been used, except by Milton, since Ben Jonson."" (_Eighteenth"

8814,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8815,B.--BLANK VERSE,Thomson's _Seasons_ was undoubtedly the most influential of the poems of
8816,B.--BLANK VERSE,"the blank-verse revival of this period. Saintsbury says: ""His blank"
8817,B.--BLANK VERSE,verse in especial cannot receive too much commendation. With that of
8818,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Milton, and that of the present Poet Laureate [Tennyson], it must rank"
8819,B.--BLANK VERSE,as one of the chief original models of the metre to be found in English
8820,B.--BLANK VERSE,"poetry."" (Ward's _English Poets_, vol. iii. p. 169.)"
8821,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8822,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Other influential poems of the same period, written in blank verse, were"
8823,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Glover's _Leonidas_ (1737), Young's _Night Thoughts_ (1742-1744), and"
8824,B.--BLANK VERSE,Akenside's _Pleasures of the Imagination_ (1744). Much earlier than
8825,B.--BLANK VERSE,these had come the curious poem of John Philips on _Cider_ (1708).
8826,B.--BLANK VERSE,Philips is praised by Thomson as the successor of Milton in some lines
8827,B.--BLANK VERSE,of _Autumn_:
8828,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8829,B.--BLANK VERSE,"""Philips, Pomona's bard, the second thou"

8832,B.--BLANK VERSE,
8833,B.--BLANK VERSE,"In general, the blank verse of all these poets shows the influence of"
8834,B.--BLANK VERSE,"the couplet and lacks flexibility. Thus Mr. Symonds says: ""The use of"
8835,B.--BLANK VERSE,the couplet had unfitted poets for its composition. Their acquired
8836,B.--BLANK VERSE,"canons of regularity, when applied to loose and flowing metre, led them"
8837,B.--BLANK VERSE,"astray.... Hence it followed, that when blank verse began again to be"
8838,B.--BLANK VERSE,"written, it found itself very much at the point where it had stood"
8839,B.--BLANK VERSE,before the appearance of Marlowe. Even Thomson ... wrote stiff and
8840,B.--BLANK VERSE,languid blank verse with monosyllabic terminations and monotonous
8841,B.--BLANK VERSE,"cadences--a pedestrian style."" (_Blank Verse_, pp. 61, 62.)[33]"

8873,B.--BLANK VERSE,"says Professor Corson. ""Cowper saw farther than any one before him had"
8874,B.--BLANK VERSE,"seen, into the secrets of the elaborate music of Milton's blank verse,"
8875,B.--BLANK VERSE,and availed himself of those secrets to some extent--to as far an extent
8876,B.--BLANK VERSE,"as the simplicity of his themes demanded."" (_Primer of English Verse_,"
8877,B.--BLANK VERSE,"p. 221.) Professor Ward speaks, however, of the ""lumbering movement"" of"
8878,B.--BLANK VERSE,"Cowper's blank verse as being in contrast to ""the neatness and ease of"
8879,B.--BLANK VERSE,"his rhymed couplets."" (_English Poets_, vol. iii. p. 432.) Cowper prided"
8880,B.--BLANK VERSE,"himself, not without reason, on the individuality of his blank verse. In"
8881,B.--BLANK VERSE,"a letter to the Rev. John Newton (Dec. 11, 1784) he said: ""Milton's"
8882,B.--BLANK VERSE,manner was peculiar. So is Thomson's. He that should write like either
8883,B.--BLANK VERSE,"of them, would, in my judgment, deserve the name of a copyist, but not"
8884,B.--BLANK VERSE,of a poet.... Blank verse is susceptible of a much greater
8885,B.--BLANK VERSE,diversification of manner than verse in rhyme: and why the modern
8886,B.--BLANK VERSE,"writers of it have all thought proper to cast their numbers alike, I"
8887,B.--BLANK VERSE,"know not."" In another letter (to Lady Hesketh, March 20, 1786) Cowper"
8888,B.--BLANK VERSE,"reveals his careful study of Milton's verse: ""When the sense requires"
8889,B.--BLANK VERSE,"it, or when for the sake of avoiding a monotonous cadence of the lines,"
8890,B.--BLANK VERSE,"of which there is always danger in so long a work, it shall appear to be"
8891,B.--BLANK VERSE,"prudent, I still leave a verse behind me that has some uneasiness in its"
8892,B.--BLANK VERSE,"formation. It is not possible to read _Paradise Lost_, with an ear for"
8893,B.--BLANK VERSE,"harmony, without being sensible of the great advantage which Milton drew"
8894,B.--BLANK VERSE,from such a management.... Uncritical readers find that they perform a
8895,B.--BLANK VERSE,long journey through several hundred pages perhaps without weariness;
8896,B.--BLANK VERSE,"they find the numbers harmonious, but are not aware of the art by which"
8897,B.--BLANK VERSE,"that harmony is brought to pass, much less suspect that a violation of"
8898,B.--BLANK VERSE,all harmony on some occasions is the very thing to which they are not a

9072,B.--BLANK VERSE,The blank verse of Tennyson is probably to be regarded as the most
9073,B.--BLANK VERSE,masterly found among modern poets.[34] Its flexibility is almost
9074,B.--BLANK VERSE,"infinite, yet never unmelodious. The last of the specimens just quoted"
9075,B.--BLANK VERSE,"illustrates his use of blank verse for short lyrical poems,--an unusual"
9076,B.--BLANK VERSE,and notable achievement. Perhaps only Collins's _Ode to Evening_ can be
9077,B.--BLANK VERSE,"compared with his success in this direction, and Collins used a more"
9078,B.--BLANK VERSE,"elaborate strophe to fill, in part, the place of rime. Of the unrimed"
9079,B.--BLANK VERSE,"lyrics in _The Princess_, Mr. Symonds says that they ""are perfect"
9080,B.--BLANK VERSE,"specimens of most melodious and complete minstrelsy in words."" In the"
9081,B.--BLANK VERSE,"""Tears, Idle Tears,"" he goes on to say, the verse ""is divided into"
9082,B.--BLANK VERSE,"periods of five lines, each of which terminates with the words 'days"
9083,B.--BLANK VERSE,that are no more.' This recurrence of sound and meaning is a substitute
9084,B.--BLANK VERSE,"for rhyme, and suggests rhyme so persuasively that it is impossible to"
9085,B.--BLANK VERSE,"call the poem mere blank verse."" See also the specimens on p. 144 above."

9090,B.--BLANK VERSE,"dramatic. It is no less flexible than Tennyson's, but (as in most of"
9091,B.--BLANK VERSE,Browning's poetry) sacrifices more of melody in adapting itself to the

9451,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),This early poem illustrates the irregular use of alexandrines near the
9452,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),time of their introduction into English. The poem opens with a
9453,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),septenary--
9454,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),
9455,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"""Tho Iesu Crist an eorthe was, mylde weren his dede;"""
9456,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),
9457,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),and septenaries and alexandrines are used interchangeably. Dr. Triggs
9458,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"says, in his notes on the poem in McLean's edition of Zupitza's"
9459,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"_Übungsbuch_, that lines 5, 6, 9-18, 25-28, 39, 40, 43, 44, 49-54, 57,"

9461,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),lxii.) The English tendency toward indifference to regularity in the
9462,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),counting of syllables is also noticeable. In the same way the early poem
9463,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"called ""The Passion of our Lord"" (ed. Morris, E.E.T.S. xlix. 37), which"
9464,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"is thought from the heading--""_Ici cumence la passyun ihesu crist en"

9466,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"alexandrines, although it opens in septenary. See also such poems as the"

9604,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),the modern use of the alexandrine is characterized by increased freedom
9605,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),in the placing of the cesura. It is also distinguished from the early

9609,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),By far the most frequent use of the alexandrine in English poetry is as

9614,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"variant from the heroic couplet, Mr. Saintsbury makes some interesting"
9615,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"observations on the measure: ""The metre, though a well-known English"

9619,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"poetry, which yet remains to be written, and which would be not the"
9620,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"least valuable of contributions to poetical criticism, this use of the"
9621,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"verse would have to be considered, as well as its regular recurrent"

9624,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"side by side, would, I think, reveal capacities, somewhat unexpected"
9625,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),even in this form of arrangement. But so far as the occasional
9626,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"alexandrine is concerned, it is not a hyperbole to say that a number,"
9627,A.--THE ALEXANDRINE (IAMBIC HEXAMETER),"out of all proportion, of the best lines in English poetry may be found"

9639,B.--THE SEPTENARY,of mediæval Latin poetry. There it was more commonly trochaic than

9649,B.--THE SEPTENARY,
9650,B.--THE SEPTENARY,Another form of the measure is illustrated by some verses quoted by

9652,B.--THE SEPTENARY,
9653,B.--THE SEPTENARY,"""Fortunae rota volvitur, descendo minoratus,"

9655,B.--THE SEPTENARY,
9656,B.--THE SEPTENARY,"In English, naturally enough, the measure always tended to be iambic. In"
9657,B.--THE SEPTENARY,both Latin and English there was considerable freedom as to the number
9658,B.--THE SEPTENARY,of light syllables. It will be noticed that in the specimens just quoted
9659,B.--THE SEPTENARY,from the Latin there is rime not only between the ends of the verses but
9660,B.--THE SEPTENARY,between the syllables just preceding the cesura. Where this was the case
9661,B.--THE SEPTENARY,there was a tendency toward the breaking up of the verse into a quatrain
9662,B.--THE SEPTENARY,"of verses in four and three stresses, riming _abab_; such septenaries,"
9663,B.--THE SEPTENARY,"indeed, were written at pleasure either in couplets or quatrains. We"
9664,B.--THE SEPTENARY,shall see the same phenomena in the English forms of the measure. But
9665,B.--THE SEPTENARY,"the seven-stress rhythm is not easily lost or mistaken, in whatever form"
9666,B.--THE SEPTENARY,"it appears, and has a certain charm which at one time appealed very"
9667,B.--THE SEPTENARY,widely to metrical taste.
9668,B.--THE SEPTENARY,
9669,B.--THE SEPTENARY,The earliest appearance of the septenary in English is in the _Poema

9901,IV. THE SONNET,"The sonnet is an Italian verse-form, in fourteen five-stress lines,"
9902,IV. THE SONNET,introduced into England at the time of the Italian literary influences
9903,IV. THE SONNET,"of the sixteenth century. Almost from the first, the English sonnet has"
9904,IV. THE SONNET,been divided into two classes: one based on more or less strict
9905,IV. THE SONNET,"imitation of the structure of the Italian form, and variously called the"
9906,IV. THE SONNET,"Italian, the regular, or the legitimate sonnet; the other taking the"
9907,IV. THE SONNET,"Italian sonnet as the point of departure, but constructed according to"
9908,IV. THE SONNET,"more familiar English rime-schemes, and commonly called the Shaksperian"
9909,IV. THE SONNET,or the English sonnet.
9910,IV. THE SONNET,
9911,IV. THE SONNET,The origin of the sonnet in southern Europe is a matter of some
9912,IV. THE SONNET,disagreement. Some scholars trace it to the _canzone_ strophe (_e.g._
9913,IV. THE SONNET,"Gaspary, in his _Geschichte der Italienischen Literatur_), others to the"
9914,IV. THE SONNET,"combination of the _ottava rima_ with a six-line stanza (Welti, in his"
9915,IV. THE SONNET,"_Geschichte des Sonettes in der deutschen Dichtung_), others to"
9916,IV. THE SONNET,"Provençal and even German influence. (See Schipper, vol. ii. pp. 835"
9917,IV. THE SONNET,"ff., and Lentzner's _Das Sonett und seine Gestaltung in der englischen"
9918,IV. THE SONNET,"Dichtung_, p. 1.) It seems first to have been a recognized form in Italy"
9919,IV. THE SONNET,in the latter part of the thirteenth century (see Tomlinson's _The
9920,IV. THE SONNET,"Sonnet: its Origin, Structure, and Place in Poetry_); and was made"
9921,IV. THE SONNET,"glorious by Dante, Michael Angelo, Tasso, Ariosto, and--above"
9922,IV. THE SONNET,"all--Petrarch. On the different forms of the Italian sonnet, see"
9923,IV. THE SONNET,"Tomlinson's essay, just cited."
9924,IV. THE SONNET,
9925,IV. THE SONNET,"""The object of the regular or legitimate Italian sonnet,"" says Mr."
9926,IV. THE SONNET,"Tomlinson, ""is to express one, and only one, idea, mood, sentiment, or"
9927,IV. THE SONNET,"proposition, and this must be introduced ... in the first quatrain, and"
9928,IV. THE SONNET,"so far explained in the second, that this may end in a full point; while"
9929,IV. THE SONNET,the office of the first tercet is to prepare the leading idea of the
9930,IV. THE SONNET,"quatrains for the conclusion, which conclusion is to be perfectly"
9931,IV. THE SONNET,"carried out in the second tercet, so that it may contain the fundamental"
9932,IV. THE SONNET,"idea of the poem."" (pp. 27, 28.)"
9933,IV. THE SONNET,
9934,IV. THE SONNET,The Italian form is always marked by the division into octave and
9935,IV. THE SONNET,"sestet, although English usage has been very irregular in marking this"
9936,IV. THE SONNET,division by a full pause. The octave is based on only two rimes
9937,IV. THE SONNET,"(_abbaabba_); the sestet on either two or three, the most common"
9938,IV. THE SONNET,"arrangements being _cdecde, cdcdcd, cdedce_, and _cddcee_."
9939,IV. THE SONNET,
9940,IV. THE SONNET,"With regard to the pause at the point of division Lentzner says: ""It"
9941,IV. THE SONNET,"should not be a full pause, because this would produce the effect of a"
9942,IV. THE SONNET,"gap or breaking-off, ...--not like the speaker who has reached the end"
9943,IV. THE SONNET,"of what he has to say, but like one who reflects on what has already"
9944,IV. THE SONNET,"been said, and then takes fresh breath to complete his theme.""[35]"
9945,IV. THE SONNET,
9946,IV. THE SONNET,Most critics prefer those forms of sestet which avoid a final riming
9947,IV. THE SONNET,"couplet. This Mr. Courthope explains as follows: ""The reason for the"
9948,IV. THE SONNET,"avoidance of the couplet in the second portion of the sonnet is, I"
9949,IV. THE SONNET,"think, plain. In the first eight lines the thought ascends to a climax;"
9950,IV. THE SONNET,this part of the sonnet may be said to contain the premises of the
9951,IV. THE SONNET,poetical syllogism. In the last six lines the idea descends to a
9952,IV. THE SONNET,"conclusion, and as the two divisions are of unequal length it is"
9953,IV. THE SONNET,necessary that the lesser should be the more individualised. Hence
9954,IV. THE SONNET,"while, in the first part, the expression of the thought is massed and"
9955,IV. THE SONNET,"condensed by reduplications of sound, and the general movement is"
9956,IV. THE SONNET,limited by quatrains; in the second part the clauses are separated by
9957,IV. THE SONNET,"the alternation of the rhymes, the movement is measured by tercets, and"
9958,IV. THE SONNET,the whole weight of the rhetorical emphasis is thrown into the last
9959,IV. THE SONNET,"line."" (_History of English Poetry_, vol. ii. p. 91.)"
9960,IV. THE SONNET,

9972,IV. THE SONNET,The following specimens are classified only in the two principal groups
9973,IV. THE SONNET,of the Italian and the English form. The common test of the Italian form
9974,IV. THE SONNET,is that the rime-scheme shall separate the first eight lines from the
9975,IV. THE SONNET,"rest, these eight lines ordinarily showing ""inclusive rime"" of the"
9976,IV. THE SONNET,_abba_ type; the test of the English form is that the rime-scheme shall

9982,IV. THE SONNET,"English form; (3) the Spenserian form; (4) the Miltonic form, with"
9983,IV. THE SONNET,correct rime-arrangement but general neglect of the bipartite structure;
9984,IV. THE SONNET,"(5) the modern Italian or Wordsworthian form, following the regular"

11042,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"This ode of Jonson's is apparently the earliest, and remained for a long"
11043,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"time the only, notable English ode based on the strict structure of the"
11044,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"Greek original. The Greek ode was commonly divided into the strophe, the"
11045,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"antistrophe, and the epode; the strophe and antistrophe being identical"
11046,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"in structure, though varying in different odes, and the epode being of"
11047,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,different structure. Jonson therefore followed the classical form

11053,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"exotic, of slight native force, and unable to reproduce the effects of"
11054,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,the Greek original. The reason is obvious. The Greek odes were
11055,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"accompanied by music and dancing, the singers moving to one side during"
11056,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"the strophe, retracing their steps during the antistrophe, ... and"
11057,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,"standing still during the epode. The ear was thus helped by the eye, and"
11058,A.--REGULAR PINDARIC,the divisions of the ode were distinct and significant. But in an

11104,I^{3},
11105,I^{3},To Congreve is due the credit for the revival of the regular ode in the
11106,I^{3},"eighteenth century, after it had been long forgotten by English poets."
11107,I^{3},"Meantime the irregular form, devised by Cowley, had become popular; and"
11108,I^{3},against the license of this Congreve protested in his _Discourse on the
11109,I^{3},"Pindaric Ode_, prefixed to his Ode of 1706. (See Mr. Gosse's"
11110,I^{3},"Introduction to _English Odes_, p. xvii., and his _Life of Congreve_, p."
11111,I^{3},158.)
11112,I^{3},
11113,I^{3},"Congreve said in his Discourse: ""The following ode is an attempt"
11114,I^{3},"towards restoring the regularity of the ancient lyric poetry, which"
11115,I^{3},"seems to be altogether forgotten, or unknown, by our English"
11116,I^{3},writers. There is nothing more frequent among us than a sort of
11117,I^{3},"poems entitled Pindaric Odes, pretending to be written in imitation"
11118,I^{3},"of the manner and style of Pindar, and yet I do not know that there"
11119,I^{3},"is to this day extant, in our language, one ode contrived after his"
11120,I^{3},model.... The character of these late Pindarics is a bundle of
11121,I^{3},"rambling incoherent thoughts, expressed in a like parcel of"
11122,I^{3},"irregular stanzas, which also consist of such another complication"
11123,I^{3},"of disproportioned, uncertain, and perplexed verses and rhymes...."
11124,I^{3},"On the contrary, there is nothing more regular than the odes of"
11125,I^{3},"Pindar, both as to the exact observation of the measures and"
11126,I^{3},"numbers of his stanzas and verses, and the perpetual coherence of"
11127,I^{3},his thoughts....
11128,I^{3},
11129,I^{3},"""Though there be no necessity that our triumphal odes should"
11130,I^{3},"consist of the three afore-mentioned stanzas, yet if the reader can"
11131,I^{3},observe that the great variation of the numbers in the third stanza
11132,I^{3},"(call it epode, or what you please) has a pleasing effect in the"
11133,I^{3},"ode, and makes him return to the first and second stanzas with more"
11134,I^{3},appetite than he could do if always cloyed with the same quantities
11135,I^{3},"and measures, I cannot see why some use may not be made of Pindar's"
11136,I^{3},"example, to the great improvement of the English ode. There is"
11137,I^{3},certainly a pleasure in beholding anything that has art and
11138,I^{3},"difficulty in the contrivance, especially if it appears so"
11139,I^{3},carefully executed that the difficulty does not show itself till it
11140,I^{3},is sought for....
11141,I^{3},
11142,I^{3},"""Having mentioned Mr. Cowley, it may very well be expected that"
11143,I^{3},"something should be said of him, at a time when the imitation of"
11144,I^{3},Pindar is the theme of our discourse. But there is that great
11145,I^{3},"deference due to the memory, great parts, and learning, of that"
11146,I^{3},"gentleman, that I think nothing should be objected to the latitude"
11147,I^{3},he has taken in his Pindaric odes. The beauty of his verses is an
11148,I^{3},atonement for the irregularity of his stanzas.... Yet I must beg
11149,I^{3},leave to add that I believe those irregular odes of Mr. Cowley may
11150,I^{3},"have been the principal, though innocent, occasion of so many"
11151,I^{3},"deformed poems since, which, instead of being true pictures of"
11152,I^{3},"Pindar, have (to use the Italian painters' term) been only"
11153,I^{3},"caricatures of him."""

11211,I^{3},
11212,I^{3},"This ode consists of strophe, epode, antistrophe, and second epode. The"
11213,I^{3},"antistrophe corresponds metrically to the strophe, as usual; the epodes"
11214,I^{3},are in four-stress couplets. It was Collins's habit to place the epode
11215,I^{3},"between the strophe and antistrophe, perhaps, as Professor Bronson"
11216,I^{3},"suggests, in order that it may produce ""an impression of its own"
11217,I^{3},"analogous to that of the Greek epode, namely, an impression of relief"
11218,I^{3},"and repose."" Mr. Bronson says further of Collins's odes: ""Collins was"
11219,I^{3},"less scholarly than Gray, but he was bolder and more original; and"
11220,I^{3},consciously or unconsciously he so constructed his odes that their
11221,I^{3},organic parts stand out clearly distinct and produce effects analogous
11222,I^{3},"to those produced by the Greek ode. In brief, his method was, first, to"
11223,I^{3},make large divisions of the thought correspond to the large divisions of
11224,I^{3},"the form; and, second, to throw out into relief the complex strophe and"
11225,I^{3},antistrophe by contrasting them with a simple epode. The reader may not
11226,I^{3},perceive the minute correspondences in form between strophe and
11227,I^{3},"antistrophe, but he can hardly fail to feel that the two answer to one"
11228,I^{3},"another in a general way."" (Athenæum Press edition of Collins,"

11673,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),
11674,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),Mr. Patmore's use of the irregular ode forms is of particular interest.
11675,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"He made a special study of the form, and applied it more widely than is"
11676,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"commonly done. His first odes were printed (not published) in 1868, and"
11677,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"from one of these the present specimen is taken. Later (1877), in"
11678,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"connection with _The Unknown Eros_, he set forth his view of the ode"
11679,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"form, treating it not as lawless but as governed by laws of its own."
11680,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"""Nearly all English metres,"" he said, ""owe their existence as metres to"
11681,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"'catalexis,' or pause, for the time of one or more feet, and, as a rule,"
11682,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"the position and amount of catalexis, are fixed. But the verse in which"
11683,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"this volume is written is catalectic _par excellence_, employing the"
11684,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),pause (as it does the rhyme) with freedom only limited by the exigencies
11685,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"of poetic passion. From the time of Drummond of Hawthornden to our own,"
11686,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),some of the noblest flights of English poetry have been taken on the
11687,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),wings of this verse; but with ordinary readers it has been more or less
11688,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"discredited by the far greater number of abortive efforts, on the part"
11689,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"sometimes of considerable poets, to adapt it to purposes with which it"
11690,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),has no expressional correspondence; or to vary it by rhythmical
11691,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"movements which are destructive of its character. Some persons,"
11692,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"unlearned in the subject of this metre, have objected to this kind of"
11693,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),verse that it is 'lawless.' But it has its laws as truly as any other.
11694,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"In its highest order, the lyric or 'ode,' it is a tetrameter, the line"
11695,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"having the time of eight iambics. When it descends to narrative, or the"
11696,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"expression of a less exalted strain of thought, it becomes a trimeter,"
11697,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"having the time of six iambics, or even a dimeter, with the time of"
11698,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),four; and it is allowable to vary the tetrameter 'ode' by the occasional
11699,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"introduction of passages in either or both of these inferior measures,"
11700,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"but not, I think, by the use of any other. The license to rhyme at"
11701,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),indefinite intervals is counterbalanced ... by unusual frequency in the
11702,B.--IRREGULAR (COWLEYAN),"recurrence of the same rhyme."" (From Patmore's Prefatory Note to _The"

12046,VI. IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL METRES,especially in modern poetry. It will appear that the classical measures
12047,VI. IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL METRES,might also be divided into two groups according to another distinction:
12048,VI. IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL METRES,those attempting to observe the quantitative prosody of the original

12066,VI. IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL METRES,"della Poesia Nuova_, a systematic attempt to introduce the"
12067,VI. IMITATIONS OF CLASSICAL METRES,classical versification. He also wrote hexameters and sapphics. In

12138,A.--LYRICAL MEASURES,trying to orm English verse so as to bring it under the rules of

12629,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,
12630,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,_Evangeline_ is undoubtedly the most popular and widely read poem in
12631,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"English hexameters, and may be said to have revived the vogue of the"
12632,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,measure in the middle of the nineteenth century. Yet its metrical
12633,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,qualities have not pleased most careful critics. Matthew Arnold said
12634,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,that the reception which the poem met with indicated that the dislike
12635,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"for the metre ""is rather among professional critics than among the"
12636,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"general public. Yet,"" he went on to say, ""a version of Homer in"
12637,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"hexameters of the _Evangeline_ type would not satisfy the judicious, nor"
12638,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"is the definite establishment of this type to be desired."" (_On"
12639,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"Translating Homer_, Macmillan ed., p. 284.) Mr. Arnold had previously"
12640,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"suggested that the ""lumbering effect"" of such hexameters as Longfellow's"
12641,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"is ""caused by their being much too dactylic""; more spondees should be"
12642,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,introduced.
12643,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,
12644,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,The editor of the Riverside edition of _Evangeline_ remarks
12645,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"interestingly: ""The measure lends itself easily to the lingering"

12647,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,verse at the end of the line and the sharp recovery at the beginning of
12648,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"the next will be snares to the reader, who must beware of a jerking"
12649,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,style of delivery.... A little practice will enable one to acquire that
12650,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"habit of reading the hexameter which we may liken, roughly, to the"
12651,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"climbing of a hill, resting a moment on the summit, and then descending"
12652,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"the other side."""
12653,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,
12654,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"Longfellow's hexameters were criticised most severely by his countryman,"
12655,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,Edgar Poe. Poe denied the possibility of any adequate representation of
12656,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"the classical hexameter in English, largely because of the impossibility"
12657,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"of using English spondees. The only genuine hexameters he knew, he"
12658,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,"declared, were some he had himself made, running:"

12666,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,Another interesting American experiment in hexameters is found in the
12667,B.--DACTYLIC HEXAMETER,_Home Pastorals_ of Bayard Taylor (1869-1874). Taylor modeled his verses

13340,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,therefore naturally interchangeable. They have been applied to a number
13341,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"of different forms, all characterized by a refrain so repeated as to"
13342,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,link together different parts of the structure. Two of these forms are
13343,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,particularly familiar. The first (called more commonly the _rondel_)
13344,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"consists of fourteen lines, with only two rimes; the first two lines"
13345,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"constitute the refrain, and are commonly repeated as the seventh and"
13346,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,eighth and again as the thirteenth and fourteenth. The rime-scheme
13347,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"varies, but is often _ABba, abAB, abbaAB_ (the capitals indicating the"
13348,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,repeated lines of the refrain). Sometimes the form is shortened to
13349,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"thirteen lines, the second line of the refrain not being repeated at the"
13350,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,close. The second principal form (called more commonly the _rondeau_)
13351,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"consists of thirteen lines, with two rimes, and an unrimed refrain,"
13352,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"taken from the opening words of the first line, which follows the eighth"
13353,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,line and is again repeated at the end. The common rime-scheme is
13354,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"_aabba,aab (refrain), aabba (refrain)_. Both these forms are found in"
13355,B.--THE RONDEAU AND RONDEL,"early French poetry, together with many variations. The modern"

13899,E.--THE SESTINA,"group, has been more used in Italy than in France, and, as the English"
13900,E.--THE SESTINA,"form of the word indicates, was introduced into England under Italian"
13901,E.--THE SESTINA,"influence. It was invented at the end of the thirteenth century, by the"
13902,E.--THE SESTINA,"troubadour Arnaut Daniel, celebrated in the following specimen. The"
13903,E.--THE SESTINA,"common form of the sestina has six stanzas of six lines each, with a"
13904,E.--THE SESTINA,"tercet at the end. There is usually no rime, but the stanzas are based"
13905,E.--THE SESTINA,"on six end-words, which are the same in all stanzas; in the tercet three"
13906,E.--THE SESTINA,"of these words are used in the middle of the lines, and three at the"
13907,E.--THE SESTINA,ends. The order of the end-words changes in each stanza according to a
13908,E.--THE SESTINA,complex system: thus (in the common modern form) if the end-words of the
13909,E.--THE SESTINA,"first stanza be represented by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the order in the second"

13966,E.--THE SESTINA,"though not represented in his extant poetry, has been but slightly"

13969,E.--THE SESTINA,"shorter lines in the same stanza also riming, while in the succeeding"
13970,E.--THE SESTINA,stanza the short-line rime of the previous stanza became the long-line

13972,E.--THE SESTINA,its new rime; so that in the whole poem each rime was used in two
13973,E.--THE SESTINA,"stanzas. Charles Cotton, one of whose rondeaus has been quoted, also"
13974,E.--THE SESTINA,"wrote a virelai. A modern specimen, by Mr. John Payne, is quoted in"

13979,E.--THE SESTINA,"Malaysia. It was imitated in French by Victor Hugo and other poets, and"
13980,E.--THE SESTINA,through French influence has found a place in English verse. It consists
13981,E.--THE SESTINA,"of an indeterminate number of stanzas of four lines each, the second and"
13982,E.--THE SESTINA,fourth line of each stanza being repeated as the first and third of the
13983,E.--THE SESTINA,"succeeding stanza, while the second and fourth lines of the last stanza"
13984,E.--THE SESTINA,repeat the first and third lines of the first stanza. Thus the whole

14087,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14088,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14089,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],Nearly all modern writers on the theory of verse have admitted that
14090,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],English words have no fixed syllabic quantities such as are postulated
14091,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"for the classical languages, but that English quantities, so far as they"
14092,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"exist, are variable and (in part at least) subjective in character. To"
14093,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"this it is true there are exceptions, chiefly among the poets, like some"
14094,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],of those considered in the preceding section on Imitations of Classical
14095,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],Metres.
14096,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14097,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"Writers who have agreed that English words have no fixed quantities, are"
14098,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],still at variance as to the relation of the element of syllabic time to
14099,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],the element of accent in English verse. Two extremes may at once be
14100,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],distinguished: that represented by the familiar statement that our
14101,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],rhythms differ from those of classical poetry in being based wholly on
14102,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"accent, and that represented most notably by the late Sidney Lanier, who"
14103,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],held that syllabic time-values in English verse are as exact and regular
14104,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],(hence as accurately measurable) as the notes of music. Lanier applied
14105,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"his theory with admirable consistency, and represented all sorts of"
14106,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"English verse, even that of the Anglo-Saxon period, in musical notation."
14107,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"He is almost universally regarded, however, as having been led by the"
14108,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],analogy between music and poetry to carry his method to quite impossible
14109,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],lengths. The most characteristic example of this is his representation
14110,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"of the familiar ""blank verse"" measure in ""three-four"" time, each"
14111,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],accented syllable being given a time-value twice as long as that of the
14112,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],adjacent unaccented syllable--a method of reading which can easily be
14113,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"shown to be contrary to all common practice. It should not be forgotten,"
14114,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"however, that a debt of gratitude is owed Mr. Lanier for having been one"
14115,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"of the first to emphasize adequately the fact that verse, like music, is"
14116,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],_rhythmical sound_.
14117,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14118,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"Besides those who make English verse to depend wholly on accent, and"
14119,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],those who give it time-values equally regular and measurable with those
14120,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"of music, there is a third class disposed to confuse the two elements of"
14121,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"quantity and accent. Of this class was Edgar Poe, who in his essay on"
14122,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],The Rationale of Verse constantly spoke of accented and unaccented
14123,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"syllables as ""long"" and ""short,"" respectively, and was even disposed to"
14124,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],carry the identification into Latin verse itself. This essay of Poe's
14125,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"has lately been defended by Mr. John M. Robertson, in the interesting"
14126,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],Appendix to his _New Essays toward a Critical Method_ (1897).
14127,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],Unfortunately Mr. Robertson seems to have perpetuated deliberately the
14128,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"confusion which he found in Poe in the use of the terms ""accent"" and"
14129,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"""quantity."" He even says that the attempt to distinguish them is"
14130,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"ill-founded, ""that quantity in speaking _must_ amount substantially to"
14131,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"the same thing as stress,"" and, again, that ""Poe's identification of"
14132,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"stress with length is perfectly sound."" Whatever be the fundamental fact"
14133,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"here, the use of terms cannot be commended. If quantity is swallowed up"
14134,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"in accent, so that accent alone dominates our verse, that is one thing;"
14135,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],if the conditions are such that a heavy stress and a long quantity
14136,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"nearly always coincide, that is also a possible doctrine; but that is"
14137,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],not to say that the two things should be identified. If all tall men
14138,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"wear long coats, or if all men--tall and short--wear long coats, it"
14139,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],follows in neither case that tallness and long-coatedness are the same
14140,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],thing. It is a mere matter of physics that duration of sound and
14141,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"intensity of sound are perfectly distinguishable, and that they have no"
14142,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],necessary connection with each other. The problem is: how are they
14143,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],related in practice?
14144,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14145,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],It has already been observed that Mr. Lanier did good service in
14146,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"emphasizing the analogy between music and poetry, but that he carried"
14147,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"the analogy too far. It may, therefore, be worth while to consider at"
14148,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],just this point the elements of likeness and of difference in the two
14149,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],forms of art. Both are forms of _rhythmical_ art: music and verse are
14150,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],alike rhythmical sound. Lanier showed with sufficient certainty that
14151,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"rhythm is dependent upon both _time_ and _accent_. He said, to be sure,"
14152,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"that ""time is _the_ essential"" element;[50] but this does not seem to"
14153,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"have been altogether what he meant, for he himself pointed out that the"
14154,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],ear insistently marks off time-elements by the sense of variation of
14155,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"stress, even when there is no real variation, as in the tick-tack of the"
14156,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],clock. He also pointed out that accent marks the rhythm of music quite
14157,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"as truly as that of verse, the rule being that ordinarily the first note"
14158,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"of each measure shall receive a special stress. It seems, then, that the"
14159,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],rhythm of music is based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal
14160,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],time-intervals. The same thing is true of the rhythm of verse. For every
14161,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],kind of metre there is a normal verse-rhythm which is present in the
14162,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"mind as the basis on which the verse is built up, no matter how many"
14163,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],variations may constantly occur. This normal rhythm is formed by a
14164,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"succession of accents at exactly equal time-intervals,[51] such as can"
14165,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"be marked off by a metronome, or by the mechanical beating of the foot"
14166,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],on the floor. We realize that the verse as commonly read frequently
14167,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],departs from this regularity of intervals; but without the regularity as
14168,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"a norm to which to refer it, we should not recognize it as verse. The"
14169,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"normal accent-interval we call a ""foot."""
14170,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14171,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"Exception must therefore be taken, it seems to me, to another contention"
14172,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"of Mr. Robertson's; namely, that ""there is no time-unit."" ""Our feet,"" he"
14173,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"says, ""are a pure convention, and the sole rhythmic fact is the"
14174,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"fluctuant relativity of long and short, or stress and slur."" I am glad"
14175,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],to be able to believe that the fundamental rhythmic fact is something
14176,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"more definite than this.[52] But the latest writer on the subject, Mr."
14177,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"Mark Liddell, in his _Introduction to the Scientific Study of Poetry_,"
14178,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"joins Mr. Robertson in finding no feet in English verse. Nay, he"
14179,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],represents the metrist who makes use of the old conventions of
14180,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"rhythmical measurement as one who will ""flounder ceaselessly amid the"
14181,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"scattered timbers of iambuses, spondees, dactyls, tribrachs, never"
14182,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"reaching the firm ground of truth""! Mr. Liddell points out that we do"
14183,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"not pronounce English words, even in verse, with mechanically regular"
14184,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],alternations of stress; and he rejects the explanation that there is
14185,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"nevertheless a typical form in the poet's and the reader's mind, on the"
14186,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"ground that it is ""a strange state of affairs that the æsthetically"
14187,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],imperfect should produce a greater pleasure than the æsthetically
14188,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"perfect."" Strange, perhaps, but as familiar as sunrise, if by"
14189,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"""æsthetically perfect"" we mean absolutely regular. Here we need to recur"
14190,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"to the analogy of music, where the phenomenon in question is so obvious."
14191,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"Let any one attempt to follow a symphony with a metronome in his hand,"
14192,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],and he will soon discover that if the metronome represents the
14193,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"æsthetically perfect rhythm, the orchestra represents a more pleasurable"
14194,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],imperfection. Its accelerations and retardations carry on a continual
14195,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"conflict with the typical time of the music, yet that typical time is"
14196,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"not only printed on every sheet, but is in the mind of every player. It"
14197,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],is precisely so with verse.
14198,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14199,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"It is true, of course, that the variations from regularity of rhythm are"
14200,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],more numerous and conspicuous in verse than in music. The reason is
14201,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],obvious: the sounds of verse have constantly to effect a compromise
14202,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],between the typical rhythm to which they are set and the irregular
14203,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"stress-and time-variations of human speech, while music has no such"
14204,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"complicated task. Lyrical verse, being closest to music, keeps the"
14205,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],typical rhythm freest from interruption; and it is worthy of remark that
14206,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],Mr. Liddell's study of English rhythms is based very largely on those of
14207,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"a non-lyrical character, although he himself points out (p. 271) that"
14208,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"these are the least regular. The drama is dominated, most of all forms"
14209,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"of verse, by the necessity of representing natural human speech; hence"
14210,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],it is not the place to look for the fundamental laws of verse at their
14211,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],purest.
14212,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14213,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"There is, then, a unit of time on which all verse-rhythms, like all"
14214,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"musical rhythms, are based; and this is what we commonly call in music"
14215,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"the _measure_, and in verse, the _foot_, I shall recur to this matter a"
14216,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],little later in considering the terminology of the subject; for the
14217,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"present let us return to the relations of verse and music. Both, we have"
14218,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"seen, are based on the recurrence of accented sounds at equal"
14219,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"time-intervals. There is some difference, however, in the emphasis which"
14220,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],one naturally places on the respective parts of the statement. In music
14221,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],we feel that the fact of chief importance is that the measures shall be
14222,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"equal in time, while the recurring accent seems a mere means of marking"
14223,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],this equality; but in verse we feel that the chief fact is that the
14224,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"accents shall recur, the equality of time-intervals being in a sense a"
14225,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"secondary source of pleasure. In music, therefore, as we have seen, we"
14226,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],treat departures from regularity of time-intervals as somewhat more
14227,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"exceptional than in verse. But the rhythm would suffer, would even"
14228,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"disappear, were either element wholly removed."
14229,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14230,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"If we look for further distinctions between verse and music, we find"
14231,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],them in the separate sounds which go to make up the unit-measures. Not
14232,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"only are the measures of music of mathematically equal length, but all"
14233,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],the sounds bear exact time-relations to each other: each is either half
14234,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"as long, or twice as long, or a quarter as long, or four times as long,"
14235,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"as its neighbor. On the other hand, the number of separate sounds in the"
14236,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],measure constantly varies; it is sufficient that the total length be
14237,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],that of the full measure. In verse these conditions are reversed. The
14238,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"separate syllables, while they doubtless vary in length, are not"
14239,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],mathematically coördinated as to duration by the ordinary reader. It is
14240,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],almost as difficult to say just what the time-relation of any two
14241,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"adjacent syllables is, as to be sure that one is stressed just twice as"
14242,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"strongly as the other. On the other hand, the _number_ of syllables in"
14243,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],the foot (in good modern English verse) is tolerably constant.
14244,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14245,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"For the sake of completeness, one may add two other fundamental"
14246,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"distinctions which, _apart_ from the elements of rhythm, differentiate"
14247,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"verse from music. Music, apart from rhythm, characteristically depends"
14248,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"on variation of pitch, and only incidentally (as in the case of the use"
14249,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],of different instruments in orchestration) on variation of
14250,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"sound-quality; whereas verse, apart from rhythm, characteristically"
14251,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"depends on variation of sound-quality,--that is, on the different sounds"
14252,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"of the different words,--and only incidentally on changes of pitch."
14253,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],"Finally, the changing sounds of music are only vaguely symbolic, while"
14254,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],the changing sounds of verse are symbolic of definite ideas.
14255,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],
14256,THE TIME-ELEMENT IN ENGLISH VERSE[49],For the sake of easy comparison we may put these observations in a rough

14499,MUSIC                                VERSE,this seems to be merely a description of the way in which the words

14512,MUSIC                                VERSE,time-intervals. It is highly improbable that any one would read this

14515,MUSIC                                VERSE,lyrical poetry. We have already seen that blank verse departs more
14516,MUSIC                                VERSE,constantly from the typical scheme of the measure than any other of our

14538,MUSIC                                VERSE,Pauses not only fill up the incomplete time of a foot containing only
14539,MUSIC                                VERSE,"short syllables, but they also fill the time of wholly missing"
14540,MUSIC                                VERSE,syllables. In the verse
14541,MUSIC                                VERSE,
14542,MUSIC                                VERSE,"""Come from the dying moon, and blow"""

14545,MUSIC                                VERSE,second and in the third foot. It does not seem certain whether the
14546,MUSIC                                VERSE,missing syllable after _dying_ is to have its place filled by a pause or
14547,MUSIC                                VERSE,by a prolongation of either or both of the syllables _dy-ing_--perhaps
14548,MUSIC                                VERSE,by all three means combined. In the same way the missing syllable after
14549,MUSIC                                VERSE,"_moon_ may have its place filled either by the prolongation of the _oo_,"
14550,MUSIC                                VERSE,"or by the pause indicated by the comma, or by both. But in other cases"
14551,MUSIC                                VERSE,"the pause occupies the entire syllable-moment; for examples, see under"
14552,MUSIC                                VERSE,Pauses in pages 20-22 above. The whole matter was well summed up in

14654,MUSIC                                VERSE,syllable of _cano_ is rhythmically connected (over the barrier of a

14656,MUSIC                                VERSE,avoided the regular coincidence of metrical units with word or sentence

14659,MUSIC                                VERSE,"dissyllables, of those accented on the first syllable, goes to explain"
14660,MUSIC                                VERSE,our preference for iambic over trochaic measures; and that one reason

14662,MUSIC                                VERSE,because its metrical divisions and word divisions so frequently
14663,MUSIC                                VERSE,coincide. The fundamental principle of verse is that it sets up a new
14664,MUSIC                                VERSE,"order of progress which constantly conflicts with, yet without"

14668,MUSIC                                VERSE,syllables viewed as rhythmical sound; and the attempt has already been
14669,MUSIC                                VERSE,made to show that it represents the time-interval between the regularly
14670,MUSIC                                VERSE,recurring accents of the normal metre. When there are two syllables in

14673,MUSIC                                VERSE,"the foot an anapest or a dactyl. According to this system, the number of"

14680,MUSIC                                VERSE,because where four syllables occur in such succession as to form a sort

14690,MUSIC                                VERSE,of a fully accented plus a slightly accented syllable must be called

14788,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,selected with reference to their bearing on two questions: Is metre
14789,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"an essential or only an incidental element of poetry? and, What are"
14790,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,its functions in the total content and effect of poetry? The
14791,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,student of the subject will do well to analyze the answers to the
14792,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"second question, determining under how many aspects of the metrical"
14793,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,element they can be grouped.
14794,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
14795,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, each of them"
14796,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"lying deep in our nature. First, the instinct of imitation is implanted"
14797,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"in man from childhood.... Next, there is the instinct for harmony and"
14798,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"rhythm, metres being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore,"
14799,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special

14804,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
14805,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"Poetry, music, and dancing constitute in Aristotle a group by"
14806,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"themselves, their common element being imitation by means of"
14807,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"rhythm--rhythm which admits of being applied to words, sounds, and the"
14808,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,movements of the body. The history of these arts bears out the views we
14809,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,find expressed in Greek writers upon the theory of music; it is a
14810,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"witness to the primitive unity of music and poetry, and to the close"
14811,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,alliance of the two with dancing.... The intimate fusion of the three
14812,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"arts afterward known as the ""musical"" arts--or rather we should perhaps"
14813,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"say, the alliance of music and dancing under the supremacy of"
14814,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,poetry--was exhibited even in the person of the artist. The office of
14815,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,the poet as teacher of the chorus demanded a practical knowledge of all
14816,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"that passed under the term ""dancing,"" including steps, gestures,"
14817,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"attitudes, and the varied resources of rhythmical movement.... The poet,"
14818,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"lyric or dramatic, composed the accompaniment as well as wrote the"
14819,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"verses; and it was made a reproach against Euripides, who was the first"
14820,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"to deviate from the established usage, that he sought the aid of Iophon,"
14821,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"son of Sophocles, in the musical setting of his dramas. The very word"
14822,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"""poet"" in classical times often implies the twofold character of poet"
14823,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"and musician, and in later writers is sometimes used, like our"
14824,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"""composer,"" in a strictly limited reference to music."
14825,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
14826,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,Aristotle does full justice to the force of rhythmic form and movement
14827,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,in the arts of music and dancing. The instinctive love of melody and
14828,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"rhythm is, again, one of the two causes to which he traces the origin of"
14829,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"poetry, but he lays little stress on this element in estimating the"
14830,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,finished products of the poetic art. In the _Rhetoric_ he observes that
14831,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,if a sentence has metre it will be poetry; but this is said in a popular
14832,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"way. It was doubtless the received opinion, but it is one which he twice"
14833,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"combats in the _Poetics_, insisting that it is not metrical form that"
14834,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,makes a poem....
14835,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
14836,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,The general question whether metre is necessary for poetical expression
14837,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"has been raised by many modern critics and poets, and has sometimes been"
14838,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"answered in the negative, as by Sidney, Shelley, Wordsworth. It is,"
14839,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"however, worth observing that from Aristotle's point of view, which was"
14840,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"mainly one of observation, the question to be determined was rather as"
14841,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,to the vehicle or medium of literary _mimesis_; and so far as the
14842,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"_mimesis_ doctrine is concerned, it is undeniable that some kinds of"
14843,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"imaginative subject-matter are better expressed in prose, some in verse,"
14844,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"and that Aristotle, who had before him experimental examples of writings"
14845,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"poetic in spirit, but not metrical in form, had sufficient grounds for"
14846,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,advocating an extension of meaning for the term _poietes_. But as
14847,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"regards the _Art_ of Poetry, his reasoning does not lead us to conclude"
14848,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,that he would have reckoned the authors of prose dialogues or romances
14849,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"among poets strictly so called. As Mr. Courthope truly says, ""he does"
14850,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,not attempt to prove that metre is not a necessary accompaniment of the
14851,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"higher conceptions of poetry,"" and he, ""therefore, cannot be ranged with"
14852,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"those who support that extreme opinion."" Still there would appear to be"
14853,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,some want of firmness in the position he takes up as to the place and
14854,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,importance of metre. In his definition of tragedy (chap. vi. 2)
14855,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"""embellished language"" is included among the constituent elements of"
14856,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,tragedy; and the phrase is then explained to mean language that has the
14857,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,twofold charm of metre (which is a branch of rhythm) and of melody. But
14858,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,these elements are placed in a subordinate rank and are hardly treated
14859,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,as essentials. They are in this respect not unlike scenery or
14860,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"spectacular effect, which, though deduced by Aristotle from the"
14861,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"definition, is not explicitly mentioned in it. The essence of the poetry"
14862,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"is the ""imitation""; the melody and the verse are the ""seasoning"" of the"
14863,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"language.... Aristotle, highly as he rates the æsthetic capacity of the"
14864,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"sense of hearing in his treatment of music, says nothing to show that he"
14865,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,values at its proper worth the power of rhythmical sound as factor in
14866,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"poetry; and this is the more striking in a Greek, whose enjoyment of"
14867,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"poetry came through the ear rather than the eye, and for whom poetry was"
14868,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"so largely associated with music. After all, there can hardly be a"
14869,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,greater difference between two ways of saying the same thing than that
14870,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"one is said in verse, the other in prose. There are some lyrics which"
14871,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"have lived and will always live by their musical charm, and by a strange"
14872,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,magic that lies in the setting of the words. We need not agree with a
14873,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,certain modern school who would empty all poetry of poetical thought and
14874,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,etherealize it till it melts into a strain of music; who sing to us we
14875,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"hardly know of what, but in such a way that the echoes of the real"
14876,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"world, its men and women, its actual stir and conflict, are faint and"
14877,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"hardly to be discerned. The poetry, we are told, resides not in the"
14878,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"ideas conveyed, not in the blending of soul and sense, but in the sound"
14879,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"itself, in the cadence of the verse. Yet, false as this view may be, it"
14880,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,is not perhaps more false than that other which wholly ignores the
14881,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,effect of musical sound and looks only to the thought that is conveyed.
14882,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,Aristotle comes perilously near this doctrine.

14962,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"be endured in metrical composition, especially in rime, than in"
14963,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,prose.... This opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the
14964,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,reader's own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the
14965,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"reperusal of the distressful parts of _Clarissa Harlowe_, or the"
14966,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"_Gamester_; while Shakspere's writings, in the most pathetic scenes,"
14967,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasure--an effect
14968,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"which, in a much greater degree than might at first be imagined, is to"
14969,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"be ascribed to small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable"
14970,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,surprise from the metrical arrangement.[56] On the other hand (what it
14971,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"must be allowed will much more frequently happen), if the poet's words"
14972,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"should be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate to raise the"
14973,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"reader to a height of desirable excitement, then (unless the poet's"
14974,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"choice of his metre has been grossly injudicious), in the feelings of"
14975,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,pleasure which the reader has been accustomed to connect with metre in
14976,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"general, and in the feeling, whether cheerful or melancholy, which he"
14977,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre,"
14978,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart
14979,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"passion to the words, and to effect the complex end which the poet"
14980,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,proposes to himself.
14981,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
14982,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory here maintained,"
14983,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,it would have been my duty to develop the various causes upon which the
14984,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,pleasure received from metrical language depends. Among the chief of
14985,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to
14986,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,those who have made any of the Arts the object of accurate reflection;
14987,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"namely, the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of"
14988,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,similitude in dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring of the
14989,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"activity of our minds, and their chief feeder.... It would not be a"
14990,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,useless employment to apply this principle to the consideration of
14991,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"metre, and to show that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure,"
14992,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,and to point out in what manner that pleasure is produced. But my limits
14993,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must content myself"
14994,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,with a general summary.
14995,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
14996,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,I have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful
14997,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,feelings; it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity;
14998,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"the emotion is contemplated till, by a species of reaction, the"
14999,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion, kindred to that which"
15000,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does"
15001,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition
15002,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"generally begins, and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but"
15003,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"the emotion, of whatever kind, and in whatever degree, from various"
15004,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"causes, is qualified by various pleasures, so that in describing any"
15005,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will,"
15006,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"upon the whole, be in a state of enjoyment. If Nature be thus cautious"
15007,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"to preserve in a state of enjoyment a being so employed, the Poet ought"
15008,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"to profit by the lesson held forth to him, and ought especially to take"
15009,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"care that, whatever passions he communicates to his reader, those"
15010,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"passions, if his reader's mind be sound and vigorous, should always be"
15011,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of harmonious
15012,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind"
15013,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of
15014,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"rime or metre of the same or similar construction, an indistinct"
15015,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,perception perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of
15016,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"real life, and yet, in the circumstance of metre, differing from it so"
15017,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"widely--all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight,"
15018,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling
15019,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,always found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper
15020,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,passions. This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned
15021,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"poetry; while, in lighter compositions, the ease and gracefulness with"
15022,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,which the Poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a
15023,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,principal source of the gratification of the reader. All that it is
15024,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"necessary to say, however, upon this subject, may be effected by"
15025,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"affirming, what few persons will deny, that of two descriptions, either"
15026,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"of passions, manners, or characters, each of them equally well executed,"
15027,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse will be read a"
15028,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,hundred times where the prose is read once.

15031,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
15032,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
15033,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"The true question must be,[57] whether there are not modes of"
15034,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"expression, a construction, and an order of sentences, which are in"
15035,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"their fit and natural place in a serious prose composition, but would be"
15036,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"disproportionate and heterogeneous in metrical poetry; and, _vice"
15037,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"versa_, whether in the language of a serious poem there may not be an"
15038,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"arrangement both of words and sentences, and a use and selection of"
15039,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"(what are called) figures of speech, both as to their kind, their"
15040,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"frequency, and their occasions, which on a subject of equal weight would"
15041,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,be vicious and alien in correct and manly prose. I contend that in both
15042,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,cases this unfitness of each for the place of the other frequently will
15043,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"and ought to exist. And, first, from the origin of metre. This I would"
15044,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,trace to the balance in the mind effected by the spontaneous effort
15045,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,which strives to hold in check the workings of passion. It might be
15046,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,easily explained likewise in what manner this salutary antagonism is
15047,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,assisted by the very state which it counteracts; and how this balance
15048,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,of antagonists became organized into metre (in the usual acceptation of
15049,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"that term) by a supervening act of the will and judgment, consciously"
15050,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,and for the foreseen purpose of pleasure. Assuming these principles as
15051,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"the data of our argument, we deduce from them two legitimate conditions,"
15052,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"which the critic is entitled to expect in every metrical work. First,"
15053,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,that as the elements of metre owe their existence to a state of
15054,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"increased excitement, so the metre itself should be accompanied by the"
15055,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"natural language of excitement. Secondly, that as these elements are"
15056,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"formed into metre artificially, by a voluntary act, with the design and"
15057,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"for the purpose of blending delight with emotion, so the traces of"
15058,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,present volition should throughout the metrical language be
15059,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,proportionally discernible....
15060,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
15061,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"Secondly, I argue from the effects of metre. As far as metre acts in and"
15062,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"for itself, it tends to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of"
15063,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,the general feelings and of the attention. This effect it produces by
15064,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"the continued excitement of surprise, and by the quick reciprocations of"
15065,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"curiosity still gratified and still re-excited, which are too slight"
15066,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"indeed to be at any moment objects of distinct consciousness, yet become"
15067,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"considerable in their aggregate influence. As a medicated atmosphere, or"
15068,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"as wine during animated conversation, they act powerfully, though"
15069,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"themselves unnoticed. Where, therefore, correspondent food and"
15070,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,appropriate matter are not provided for the attention and feelings thus
15071,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"roused, there must needs be disappointment felt;--like that of leaping"
15072,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"in the dark from the last step of a staircase, when we had prepared our"
15073,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,muscles for a leap of three or four.
15074,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
15075,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"The discussion on the powers of metre, in the Preface, is highly"
15076,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"ingenious, and touches at all points on truth. But I cannot find any"
15077,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,statement of its powers considered abstractly and separately. On the
15078,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"contrary, Mr. Wordsworth seems always to estimate metre by the powers"
15079,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"which it exerts during (and, as I think, in consequence of) its"
15080,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,combination with other elements of poetry. Thus the previous difficulty
15081,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"is left unanswered, what the elements are with which it must be combined"
15082,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,in order to produce its own effects to any pleasurable purpose.... For
15083,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"any poetic purposes, metre resembles (if the aptness of the simile may"
15084,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"excuse its meanness) yeast, worthless or disagreeable by itself, but"
15085,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,giving vivacity and spirit to the liquor with which it is proportionally
15086,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,combined....
15087,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
15088,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"Metre in itself is simply a stimulant of the attention, and therefore"
15089,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"excites the question, Why is the attention to be thus stimulated? Now"
15090,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,the question cannot be answered by the pleasure of the metre itself; for
15091,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"this we have shown to be conditional, and dependent on the"
15092,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,appropriateness of the thoughts and expressions to which the metrical
15093,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,form is superadded. Neither can I conceive any other answer that can be
15094,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"rationally given, short of this: I write in metre, because I am about to"
15095,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,use a language different from that of prose....
15096,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
15097,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"Thirdly, I deduce the position from all the causes elsewhere assigned"
15098,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"which render metre the proper form of poetry, and poetry imperfect and"
15099,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"defective without metre. Metre, therefore, having been connected with"
15100,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"poetry most often, and by a peculiar fitness, whatever else is combined"
15101,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"with metre must, though it be not itself essentially poetic, have"
15102,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"nevertheless some property in common with poetry, as an intermedium of"
15103,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,affinity.

15107,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,
15108,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"In the youth of the world, men dance and sing and imitate natural"
15109,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"objects, observing in these actions, as in all others, a certain rhythm"
15110,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"or order. And, although all men observe a similar, they observe not the"
15111,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"same order, in the motions of the dance, in the melody of the song, in"
15112,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"the combinations of language, in the series of their imitations of"
15113,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,natural objects. For there is a certain order or rhythm belonging to

15115,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,and the spectator receive an intenser and purer pleasure than from any
15116,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,other: the sense of an approximation to this order has been called taste

15119,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"Language, color, form, and religious and civil habits of action are all"
15120,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,the instruments and materials of poetry; and they may be called poetry
15121,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,by that figure of speech which considers the effect as a synonym of the
15122,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,cause. But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses those
15123,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"arrangements of language, and especially metrical language, which are"
15124,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,created by that imperial faculty whose throne is curtained within the
15125,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,invisible nature of man. And this springs from the nature itself of
15126,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"language, which is a more direct representation of the actions and"
15127,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"passions of our internal being, and is susceptible of more various and"
15128,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"delicate combinations than color, form, or motion, and is more plastic"
15129,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,and obedient to the control of that faculty of which it is the
15130,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,creation.... Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between each

15132,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,order of those relations has always been found connected with a
15133,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,perception of the order of the relations of thoughts. Hence the language

15214,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,difference between a poetical and prosaical subject; and the reason why
15215,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,verse is necessary to the form of poetry is that the perfection of

15296,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,possible. This is tolerably obvious in the case of what is often called

15312,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,where we find delight of the intangible and non-reasonable kind are
15313,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,exceptions that only prove the rule. One has but to test by

15333,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,... In considering the total contribution of metre to imaginative
15334,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"language, it is impossible to overlook the quality of _permanence_. I do"
15335,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,not mean permanence merely in the sense that metrical words live in the
15336,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,"memory.... This is, of course, a most important fact; but I am here"
15337,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,dealing only with elements of effect that enter into the actual moment

15340,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,in an arch as compared with a casual heap of stones; it is a similar
15341,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,indispensableness which gives to metrical language an air of permanence
15342,THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF THE METRICAL ELEMENT IN POETRY,impossible even to the most harmonious sentence whose sounds conform to

15711,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,
15712,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,although here a certain secondary accent on the eighth syllable is

15716,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,
15717,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,the third foot is counted a pyrrhic and the fourth a spondee.[61]

15719,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"One may get, then, from a table of this sort, a general view of the"
15720,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"character of any particular piece of verse, in respect to the poet's"
15721,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"preference for run-on lines, for feminine endings, for breaking the"

15725,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,occur; a trochee in the second foot is a very different thing from one
15726,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,in the first; but it is difficult to tabulate facts of this order
15727,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,without complicating one's results beyond the point of serviceable

15729,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,
15730,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,Some students of verse are doubtless offended by the use of statistics
15731,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,in connection with a subject of this kind; and it is easy to ridicule
15732,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,the obvious incongruity of mathematical methods and poetry. A recent
15733,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"magazine critic makes merry over certain statistical studies in rhythm,"

15741,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,likely to recommend elementary students to count trochees and cesuras in
15742,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,order to increase their appreciation of good verse. But when one comes
15743,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"to the point of generalizing as to the laws or history of verse-forms,"
15744,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"it is well to have a method of correction, representable in figures"
15745,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"black and white, for the vague impressions which are all that"
15746,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,appreciative reading can give. Perhaps the real service of such a method
15747,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,as has just been described is to prevent one from making hasty
15748,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,generalizations which statistics will not support.

15756,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,syllables is indicated by the figures 3/4 in the first column. A trochee
15757,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"in the first foot is indicated by the figure 1 in the ""T"" column; a"
15758,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,"spondee in the fourth foot by the figure 4 in the ""S"" column; and so on."
15759,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,A simple check-mark in the sixth or seventh column indicates
15760,TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY OF THE HEROIC COUPLET,respectively a case of _enjambement_ or of feminine ending. When the
