285,LEPANTO,"White founts falling in the Courts of the sun,"
286,LEPANTO,And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;
287,LEPANTO,"There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,"
288,LEPANTO,"It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard,"
289,LEPANTO,"It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips,"
290,LEPANTO,For the inmost sea of all the earth is shake with his ships.
291,LEPANTO,"They have dared the white republics up the cape of Italy,"
292,LEPANTO,"They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,"
293,LEPANTO,"And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,"
294,LEPANTO,And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross.
295,LEPANTO,The cold queen of England is looking in the glass;
296,LEPANTO,The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;
297,LEPANTO,"From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun,"
298,LEPANTO,And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun.
299,LEPANTO,
300,LEPANTO,"Dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard,"
301,LEPANTO,"Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred,"
302,LEPANTO,"Where, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall,"
303,LEPANTO,"The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall,"
304,LEPANTO,"The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung,"
305,LEPANTO,That once went singing southward when all the world was young.
306,LEPANTO,"In that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid,"
307,LEPANTO,Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade.
308,LEPANTO,
309,LEPANTO,"Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far,"
310,LEPANTO,"Don John of Austria is going to the war,"
311,LEPANTO,Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold
312,LEPANTO,"In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold,"
313,LEPANTO,"Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,"
314,LEPANTO,"Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes."
315,LEPANTO,Don John laughing in the brave beard curled.
316,LEPANTO,"Spuming of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world,"
317,LEPANTO,Holding his head up for a flag of all the free.
318,LEPANTO,Love-light of Spain--hurrah!
319,LEPANTO,Death-light of Africa!
320,LEPANTO,Don John of Austria

323,LEPANTO,"Mahound is in his paradise above the evening star,"
324,LEPANTO,_(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)_
325,LEPANTO,"He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri's knees,"
326,LEPANTO,His turban that is woven of the sunsets and the seas.
327,LEPANTO,"He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease,"
328,LEPANTO,"And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees,"
329,LEPANTO,And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring
330,LEPANTO,Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing.
331,LEPANTO,"Giants and the Genii,"
332,LEPANTO,"Multiplex of wing and eye,"
333,LEPANTO,Whose strong obedience broke the sky
334,LEPANTO,When Solomon was king.
335,LEPANTO,
336,LEPANTO,"They rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn,"
337,LEPANTO,From temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn;
338,LEPANTO,They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea
339,LEPANTO,Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be;
340,LEPANTO,"On them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl,"
341,LEPANTO,"Splashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl;"
342,LEPANTO,"They swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground,--"
343,LEPANTO,They gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound.
344,LEPANTO,"And he saith, ""Break up the mountains where the hermit-folk can hide,"
345,LEPANTO,"And sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide,"
346,LEPANTO,"And chase the Giaours flying night and day, not giving rest,"
347,LEPANTO,For that which was our trouble comes again out of the west.
348,LEPANTO,"We have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun,"
349,LEPANTO,"Of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done,"
350,LEPANTO,"But a noise is in 'the mountains, in the mountains, and I know"
351,LEPANTO,The voice that shook our palaces--four hundred years ago:
352,LEPANTO,It is he that saith not 'Kismet'; it is he that knows not Fate;
353,LEPANTO,"It is Richard, it is Raymond, it is Godfrey in the gate!"
354,LEPANTO,"It is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth,"
355,LEPANTO,"Put down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth."""
356,LEPANTO,"For he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar,"
357,LEPANTO,_(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)_
358,LEPANTO,Sudden and still--hurrah!
359,LEPANTO,Bolt from Iberia!
360,LEPANTO,Don John of Austria
361,LEPANTO,Is gone by Alcalar.
362,LEPANTO,
363,LEPANTO,St. Michael's on his Mountain in the sea-roads of the north
364,LEPANTO,_(Don John of Austria is girt and going forth.)_
365,LEPANTO,Where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift
366,LEPANTO,And the sea-folk labour and the red sails lift.
367,LEPANTO,He shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone;
368,LEPANTO,The noise is gone through Normandy; the noise is gone alone;
369,LEPANTO,The North is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes
370,LEPANTO,"And dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise,"
371,LEPANTO,And Christian killeth Christian in a narrow dusty
372,LEPANTO,"And Christian dreadeth Christ that hath a newer face of doom,"
373,LEPANTO,"And Christian hateth Mary that God kissed in Galilee,"
374,LEPANTO,But Don John of Austria is riding to the sea.
375,LEPANTO,Don John calling through the blast and the eclipse
376,LEPANTO,"Crying with the trumpet, with the trumpet of his lips,"
377,LEPANTO,Trumpet that sayeth ha!
378,LEPANTO,_Domino gloria_!
379,LEPANTO,Don John of Austria
380,LEPANTO,Is shouting to the ships.
381,LEPANTO,
382,LEPANTO,King Philip's in his closet with the Fleece about his neck
383,LEPANTO,_(Don John of Austria is armed upon the deck.)_
384,LEPANTO,"The walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin,"

2272,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2273,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"Smile at us, pay us, pass us; but do not quite forget."
2274,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"For we are the people of England, that never has spoken yet."
2275,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"There is many a fat farmer that drinks less cheerfully,"
2276,THE SECRET PEOPLE,There is many a free French peasant who is richer and sadder than we.
2277,THE SECRET PEOPLE,There are no folk in the whole world so helpless or so wise.
2278,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"There is hunger in our bellies, there is laughter in our eyes;"
2279,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"You laugh at us and love us, both mugs and eyes are wet:"
2280,THE SECRET PEOPLE,Only you do not know us. For we have not spoken yet.
2281,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2282,THE SECRET PEOPLE,The fine French kings came over in a flutter of flags and dames.
2283,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"We liked their smiles and battles, but we never could say their names."
2284,THE SECRET PEOPLE,The blood ran red to Bosworth and the High French lords went down;
2285,THE SECRET PEOPLE,There was naught but a naked people under a naked crown.
2286,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2287,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"And the eyes of the King's Servants turned terribly every way,"
2288,THE SECRET PEOPLE,And the gold of the King's Servants rose higher every day.
2289,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"They burnt the homes of the shaven men, that had been quaint and kind,"
2290,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"Till there was no bed in a monk's house, nor food that man could find."
2291,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"The inns of God where no man paid, that were the wall of the weak,"
2292,THE SECRET PEOPLE,The King's Servants ate them all. And Still we did not speak.
2293,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2294,THE SECRET PEOPLE,And the face of the King's Servants grew greater than the King:
2295,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"He tricked them, and they trapped him, and stood round him in a ring."
2296,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"The new grave lords closed round him, that had eaten the abbey's fruits."
2297,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"And the men of the new religion, with their bibles in their boots."
2298,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"We saw their shoulders moving, to menace or discuss,"
2299,THE SECRET PEOPLE,And some were pure and some were vile; but none took heed of us.
2300,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"We saw the King as they killed him, and his face was proud and pale;"
2301,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"And a few men talked of freedom, while England talked of ale."
2302,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2303,THE SECRET PEOPLE,A war that we understood not came over the world and woke
2304,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"Americans, Frenchmen, Irish; but we knew not the things they spoke."
2305,THE SECRET PEOPLE,They talked about rights and nature and peace and the people's reign:
2306,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"And the squires, our masters, bade us fight; and never scorned us again."
2307,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"Weak if we be for ever, could none condemn us then;"
2308,THE SECRET PEOPLE,Men called us serfs and drudges; men knew that we were men.
2309,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"In foam and flame at Trafalgar, on Albuera plains,"
2310,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"We did and died like lions, to keep ourselves in chains,"
2311,THE SECRET PEOPLE,We lay in living ruins; firing and fearing not
2312,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"The strange fierce face of the Frenchmen who knew for what they fought,"
2313,THE SECRET PEOPLE,And the man who seemed to be more than man we strained against and broke;
2314,THE SECRET PEOPLE,And we broke our own rights with him. And still we never spoke.
2315,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2316,THE SECRET PEOPLE,Our patch of glory ended; we never heard guns again.
2317,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"But the squire seemed struck in the saddle; he was foolish, as if in pain"
2318,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"He leaned on a staggering lawyer, he clutched a cringing Jew,"
2319,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"He was stricken; it may be, after all, he was stricken at Waterloo."
2320,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"Or perhaps the shades of the shaven men, whose spoil is in his house,"
2321,THE SECRET PEOPLE,Come back in shining shapes at last to spoil his last carouse:
2322,THE SECRET PEOPLE,We only know the last sad squires ride slowly towards the sea.
2323,THE SECRET PEOPLE,And a new people takes the land: and still it is not we.
2324,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2325,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"They have given us into the hand of the new unhappy lords,"
2326,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"Lords without anger and honour, who dare not carry their swords."
2327,THE SECRET PEOPLE,They fight by shuffling papers; they have bright dead alien eyes;
2328,THE SECRET PEOPLE,They look at our labour and laughter as a tired man looks at flies.
2329,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"And the load 01 their loveless pity is worse than the ancient wrongs,"
2330,THE SECRET PEOPLE,Their doors are shut in the evening; and they know no songs.
2331,THE SECRET PEOPLE,
2332,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"We hear men speaking for us of new laws strong and sweet,"
2333,THE SECRET PEOPLE,Yet is there no man speaketh as we speak in the street.
2334,THE SECRET PEOPLE,"It may be we shall rise the last as Frenchmen rose the first,"
2335,THE SECRET PEOPLE,Our wrath come after Russia's wrath and our wrath be the worst.
2336,THE SECRET PEOPLE,It may be we are meant to mark with our riot and our rest
2337,THE SECRET PEOPLE,God's scorn for all men governing. It may be beer is best.
2338,THE SECRET PEOPLE,But we are the people of England; and we have not spoken yet.
