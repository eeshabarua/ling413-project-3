133,PREFACE,PREFACE
134,PREFACE,
135,PREFACE,
136,PREFACE,This is not like other collections of religious verse; still less is it
137,PREFACE,a hymnal. The present volume is directed to a very specific and wholly
138,PREFACE,"practical end, the production of high personal character; and only those"
139,PREFACE,poems which have an immediate bearing in this direction have been
140,PREFACE,admitted. We know of no other book published which has followed this
141,PREFACE,"special line. There are fine hymnals, deservedly dear to the Church, but"
142,PREFACE,they are necessarily devoted in large measure to institutional and
143,PREFACE,"theological subjects, are adapted to the wants of the general"
144,PREFACE,congregation and to purposes of song; while many poetical productions
145,PREFACE,that touch the heart the closest are for that very reason unsuited to
146,PREFACE,the hymnal. There are many anthologies and plentiful volumes of
147,PREFACE,"religious poetry, but not one coming within our ken has been made up as"
148,PREFACE,"this has been. We have sought far and wide, through many libraries,"
149,PREFACE,"carefully conning hundreds of books and glancing through hundreds more,"
150,PREFACE,to find just those lines which would have the most tonic and stimulating
151,PREFACE,"effect in the direction of holier, nobler living. We have coveted verses"
152,PREFACE,whose influence would be directly on daily life and would help to form
153,PREFACE,"the very best habits of thought and conduct, which would have intrinsic"
154,PREFACE,spiritual value and elevating power; those whose immediate tendency
155,PREFACE,"would be to make people better, toughening their moral fibre and helping"
156,PREFACE,them heavenward; those which they could hardly read attentively without
157,PREFACE,feeling an impulse toward the things which are pure and true and
158,PREFACE,"honorable and lovely and of good report, things virtuous and"
159,PREFACE,praiseworthy.
160,PREFACE,
161,PREFACE,It is surprising to one who has not made the search how very many poets
162,PREFACE,"there are whose voluminous and popular works yield nothing, or scarcely"
163,PREFACE,"anything, of this sort. We have looked carefully through many scores of"
164,PREFACE,volumes of poetry without finding a line that could be of the slightest
165,PREFACE,use in this collection. They were taken up altogether with other topics.
166,PREFACE,"They contained many pretty conceits, pleasant descriptions, lovely or"
167,PREFACE,"lively narrations--these in abundance, but words that would send the"
168,PREFACE,"spirit heavenward, or even earthward with any added love for humanity,"
169,PREFACE,"not one. On the other hand, in papers and periodicals, even in books,"
170,PREFACE,"are great multitudes of verses, unexceptionable in sentiment and helpful"
171,PREFACE,"in influence, which bear so little of the true poetic afflatus, are so"
172,PREFACE,"careless in construction or so faulty in diction, so imperfect in rhyme"
173,PREFACE,"or rhythm, so much mingled with colloquialisms or so hopelessly"
174,PREFACE,"commonplace in thought, as to be unworthy of a permanent place in a book"
175,PREFACE,like this. They would not bear reading many times. They would offend a
176,PREFACE,properly educated taste. They would not so capture the ear as to linger
177,PREFACE,"on the memory with compelling persistence, nor strike the intellect as"
178,PREFACE,an exceptional presentation of important truth. The combination of fine
179,PREFACE,"form and deep or inspiring thought is by no means common, but, when"
180,PREFACE,"found, very precious. We will not claim that this has been secured in"
181,PREFACE,all the poems here presented. Not all will approve our choice in all
182,PREFACE,respects. There is nothing in which tastes more differ than in matters
183,PREFACE,of this kind. And we will admit that in some cases we have let
184,PREFACE,in--because of the important truth which they so well voiced--stanzas
185,PREFACE,not fully up to the mark in point of poetic merit. Where it has not been
186,PREFACE,"possible to get the two desirable things together, as it has not always,"
187,PREFACE,we have been more solicitous for the sentiment that would benefit than
188,PREFACE,for mere prettiness or perfection of form. Helpfulness has been the test
189,PREFACE,oftener than a high literary standard. The labored workmanship of the
190,PREFACE,vessel has not weighed so much with us as its perfect fitness to convey
191,PREFACE,the water of life wherewith the thirsty soul of man has been or may be
192,PREFACE,"refreshed. If poets are properly judged, as has been alleged, by the"
193,PREFACE,"frame of mind they induce, then some who have not gained great literary"
194,PREFACE,fame may still hold up their heads and claim a worthy crown.
195,PREFACE,
196,PREFACE,"Some poems fully within the scope of the book--like Longfellow's ""Psalm"
197,PREFACE,"of Life""--have been omitted because of their exceeding commonness and"
198,PREFACE,"their accessibility. Many hymns of very high value--like ""Jesus, Lover"
199,PREFACE,"of my soul,"" ""My faith looks up to thee,"" ""Nearer, my God, to thee,"""
200,PREFACE,"""When all thy mercies, O my God,"" ""How firm a foundation""--have also"
201,PREFACE,"been omitted because they are found in all the hymnals, and to include"
202,PREFACE,"them would unduly swell the size of the book. A few others, although"
203,PREFACE,"similarly familiar, like ""Jesus, I my cross have taken,"" and ""God moves"
204,PREFACE,"in a mysterious way,"" have been inserted from a feeling that even yet"
205,PREFACE,their depth and richness are not properly appreciated and that they can
206,PREFACE,never be sufficiently pondered. A few poems we have been unable to
207,PREFACE,procure permission to use; but in nearly all cases we have met with most
208,PREFACE,"generous treatment from both authors and publishers owning copyrights,"

257,PREFACE,publishers of their works. Many other poems used have been found in
258,PREFACE,papers or other places which gave no indication of the original source.
259,PREFACE,In spite of much effort to trace these things it is quite likely we have
260,PREFACE,failed in some cases to give due credit or obtain the usual permission;
261,PREFACE,"and we hope that if such omissions, due to ignorance or inadvertence,"
262,PREFACE,are noticed they will be pardoned. Many unknown writers have left behind
263,PREFACE,"them some things of value, but their names have become detached from"
264,PREFACE,them or perhaps never were appended. Many volumes consulted have been
265,PREFACE,long out of print.

294,PREFACE,
295,PREFACE,The number of American poets drawn upon is small compared with this
296,PREFACE,list. It is the case in all such collections. According to an analysis
297,PREFACE,of the hymns contained in the most widely used American hymnals down to
298,PREFACE,1880 the average number of hymns of purely American origin was not quite
299,PREFACE,one in seven; the proportion would be a little larger now. And the
300,PREFACE,"number of Methodist poets is almost nil, in spite of the fact that the"
301,PREFACE,compiler is a Methodist and the volume is issued from the official
302,PREFACE,Methodist Publishing House. But if we thought that this would be any
303,PREFACE,barrier to its wide circulation in Methodist homes we should be deeply
304,PREFACE,ashamed for our church. We are confident it will not be. For mere
305,PREFACE,denominational tenets do not at all enter into these great matters of
306,PREFACE,"the soul's life. A book like this speaks loudly for the real oneness,"
307,PREFACE,"not only of all branches of the Christian Church, but of all religions,"
308,PREFACE,in some respects. Not only do we find the various Protestant
309,PREFACE,denominations amply represented here; not only have we most inspiring
310,PREFACE,"words from Roman Catholic writers like Francis Xavier, Madame Guyon,"
311,PREFACE,"Alexander Pope, John Henry Newman, Frederick W. Faber, and Adelaide Anne"
312,PREFACE,"Procter; but from Mohammedan sources, from Sufi saints of Persia, and"
313,PREFACE,"the Moslem devotees of Arabia, and even from Hinduism, there are"
314,PREFACE,utterances of noblest truth which we cannot read without a kindling
315,PREFACE,heart. These are all brought together from the ends of the earth into a
316,PREFACE,"delightful ""upper chamber,"" where the warring discords of opinion cease"
317,PREFACE,and an exceedingly precious peace prevails.
318,PREFACE,
319,PREFACE,"It should be said, though it is perhaps hardly necessary, that this is"
320,PREFACE,by no means a book to be read at a sitting. It furnishes very
321,PREFACE,concentrated nourishment. It can be taken with largest profit only a
322,PREFACE,"little at a time, according as the mood demands and circumstances"
323,PREFACE,"appoint. There should be very much meditation mingled with the perusal,"
324,PREFACE,an attempt to penetrate the deep meaning of the lines and have them
325,PREFACE,enter into the soul for practical benefit. Some of these hymns have
326,PREFACE,great histories: they are the war cries of combatants on hard-fought
327,PREFACE,battle fields; they are living words of deep experience pressed out of
328,PREFACE,the heart by strong feeling; they are the embodiment of visions caught
329,PREFACE,on some Pisgah's glowing top. Here will be found and furnished hope for
330,PREFACE,"the faint-hearted, rest for the weary, courage for the trembling, cheer"
331,PREFACE,"for the despondent, power for the weak, comfort for the afflicted,"
332,PREFACE,"guidance in times of difficulty, wise counsel for moments of perplexity,"
333,PREFACE,"a stimulant to faithfulness, a cure for the blues, exhilaration,"
334,PREFACE,jubilation. Everything of a depressing nature has been scrupulously
335,PREFACE,"ruled out. The keynote, persistently followed through all the pages, is"
336,PREFACE,"optimistic, bright, buoyant. Trumpet calls and bugle notes are furnished"
337,PREFACE,"in abundance, but no dirges or elegies. Large space, it will be seen, is"
338,PREFACE,"given to such topics as Heroism, True Greatness, the Care and Presence"
339,PREFACE,"of God, the blessings of Brotherliness, the privilege of Service, the"
340,PREFACE,"path of Peace, the secret of Contentment, the mission of Prayer, the joy"
341,PREFACE,"of Jesus, the meaning of Life, the glory of Love, the promise of Faith,"
342,PREFACE,the happy aspect of old Age and Death; for these subjects come very
343,PREFACE,"close home to the heart, and are illustrated in daily experience. Anyone"
344,PREFACE,who feels a special need in any of these directions is confidently
345,PREFACE,recommended to turn to the proper sections and read the selections.
346,PREFACE,
347,PREFACE,"Very much that is here may easily and suitably be committed to memory,"
348,PREFACE,that thus it may the more permanently penetrate into the inmost depth of
349,PREFACE,being. It may be used with most telling effect in sermons to give point
350,PREFACE,and pungency to the thought of the preacher. Alike in popular discourse
351,PREFACE,and public testimony or in private meditation these gems of sentiment
352,PREFACE,and thought will come into play with great advantage. The benefit which
353,PREFACE,"may be derived from them can scarcely be overestimated. President Eliot,"
354,PREFACE,"of Harvard University, has said: ""There are bits of poetry in my mind"
355,PREFACE,learned in infancy that have stood by me in keeping me true to my ideas
356,PREFACE,of duty and life. Rather than lose these I would have missed all the
357,PREFACE,"sermons I have ever heard."" Many another can say substantially the same,"
358,PREFACE,can trace his best deeds very largely to the influence of some little
359,PREFACE,stanza or couplet early stored away in his memory and coming ever
360,PREFACE,freshly to mind in after years as the embodiment of truest wisdom.
361,PREFACE,
362,PREFACE,We cannot guarantee in all cases the absolute correctness of the forms
363,PREFACE,"of the poems given, though much pains have been taken to ensure"
364,PREFACE,accuracy; but authors themselves make changes in their productions at
365,PREFACE,different times in different editions. Nor have we always been able to
366,PREFACE,trace the poem to its source. Slips and errors of various kinds can
367,PREFACE,hardly be avoided in such matters. Even so competent an editor as John
368,PREFACE,"G. Whittier, in his ""Songs of Three Centuries,"" ascribes ""Love divine,"
369,PREFACE,"all love excelling"" to that bitter Calvinist, Augustus M. Toplady,"
370,PREFACE,giving it as the sole specimen of his verse; when it was really written
371,PREFACE,"by the ardent Arminian, Charles Wesley, with whom Toplady was on"
372,PREFACE,anything but friendly terms. If Whittier could make a blunder of this
373,PREFACE,magnitude we may be pardoned if possibly a keen-eyed critic spies
374,PREFACE,something in our book almost as grossly incorrect. In some cases we have
375,PREFACE,been obliged to change the titles of poems so as to avoid reduplication
376,PREFACE,"in our index, or to adapt them the better to the small extract taken"
377,PREFACE,from the much longer form in the original. In a few cases we have made
378,PREFACE,(indicated) alterations in poems to fit them more fully to the purpose
379,PREFACE,of the book.
380,PREFACE,
381,PREFACE,"The volume will be found not only a readable one, we think, but also an"
382,PREFACE,uncommonly useful one for presentation by those who would do good and
383,PREFACE,give gratification to their serious-minded friends with a taste for
384,PREFACE,"religious poetry and a love for wandering in the ""holy land of song."" He"
385,PREFACE,who would put before another the essential elements of religion would do
386,PREFACE,better to give him such a book as this than a treatise on theology. He
387,PREFACE,who would himself get a clear idea of what the religious life really is
388,PREFACE,will do better to pore over these pages than to dip into some
389,PREFACE,philosophical discussion. Here the best life is expressed rather than
390,PREFACE,"analyzed, exhibited rather than explained. Mrs. Browning has well said,"
391,PREFACE,"""Plant a poet's word deep enough in any man's breast, looking presently"
392,PREFACE,"for offshoots, and you have done more for the man than if you dressed"
393,PREFACE,"him in a broadcloth coat and warmed his Sunday pottage at your fire."" We"
394,PREFACE,"who, by preparing or circulating such volumes, aid the poets in finding"
395,PREFACE,"a larger circle to whom to give their message, may claim a part of the"
396,PREFACE,blessing which comes to those who in any way aid humanity. George
397,PREFACE,"Herbert has said,"
398,PREFACE,
399,PREFACE,"""A verse may find him who a sermon flies,"
400,PREFACE,"And turn delight into a sacrifice."""
401,PREFACE,
402,PREFACE,He himself most excellently illustrated the sentiment by bequeathing to
403,PREFACE,the world many beautiful verses that are sermons of the most picturesque
404,PREFACE,sort.
405,PREFACE,
406,PREFACE,"One definition of poetry is ""a record of the best thoughts and best"
407,PREFACE,"moments of the best and happiest minds."" This in itself would almost be"
408,PREFACE,sufficient to establish the connection between poetry and religion. It
409,PREFACE,is certain that the two have very close and vital relations. Dr.
410,PREFACE,"Washington Gladden has admirably remarked, ""Poetry is indebted to"
411,PREFACE,"religion for its largest and loftiest inspirations, and religion is"
412,PREFACE,"indebted to poetry for its subtlest and most luminous interpretations."""
413,PREFACE,"No doubt a man may be truly, deeply religious who has little or no"
414,PREFACE,"development on the æsthetic side, to whom poetry makes no special"
415,PREFACE,"appeal. But it is certain that he whose soul is deaf to the ""concord of"
416,PREFACE,"sweet sounds"" misses a mighty aid in the spiritual life. For a hymn is a"
417,PREFACE,wing by which the spirit soars above earthly cares and trials into a
418,PREFACE,purer air and a clearer sunshine. Nothing can better scatter the devils
419,PREFACE,"of melancholy and gloom or doubt and fear. When praise and prayer, trust"
420,PREFACE,"and love, faith and hope, and similar sentiments, have passed into and"
421,PREFACE,"through some poet's passionate soul, until he has become so charged with"
422,PREFACE,them that he has been able to fix them in a form of expression where
423,PREFACE,"beauty is united to strength, where concentration and ornamentation are"
424,PREFACE,"alike secured, then the deepest needs of great numbers are fully met."
425,PREFACE,What was vague and dim is brought into light. What was only half
426,PREFACE,"conceived, and so but half felt, is made to grip the soul with power."
427,PREFACE,Poetry is of the very highest value for the inspiration and guidance of
428,PREFACE,"life, for calling out the emotions and opening up spiritual visions. It"
429,PREFACE,"carries truths not only into the understanding, but into the heart,"
430,PREFACE,where they are likely to have the most direct effect on conduct.
431,PREFACE,
432,PREFACE,"In the language of Robert Southey, I commit these pages to the Christian"
433,PREFACE,"public, with a sincere belief that much benefit will result to all who"
434,PREFACE,shall read them:
435,PREFACE,
436,PREFACE,"""Go forth, little book, from this my solitude;"
437,PREFACE,"I cast thee on the waters,--go thy ways;"
438,PREFACE,"And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,"

1224,HEROISM,It takes great strength to train
1225,HEROISM,To modern service your ancestral brain;
1226,HEROISM,To lift the weight of the unnumbered years
1227,HEROISM,"Of dead men's habits, methods, and ideas;"
1228,HEROISM,"To hold that back with one hand, and support"
1229,HEROISM,With the other the weak steps of the new thought.
1230,HEROISM,
1231,HEROISM,It takes great strength to bring your life up square
1232,HEROISM,With your accepted thought and hold it there;

1234,HEROISM,From new attempts to the old habit's track.
1235,HEROISM,"It is so easy to drift back, to sink;"
1236,HEROISM,So hard to live abreast of what you think.
1237,HEROISM,
1238,HEROISM,It takes great strength to live where you belong
1239,HEROISM,When other people think that you are wrong;
1240,HEROISM,"People you love, and who love you, and whose"
1241,HEROISM,Approval is a pleasure you would choose.
1242,HEROISM,To bear this pressure and succeed at length
1243,HEROISM,"In living your belief--well, it takes strength,"
1244,HEROISM,
1245,HEROISM,"And courage, too. But what does courage mean"
1246,HEROISM,Save strength to help you face a pain foreseen?
1247,HEROISM,Courage to undertake this lifelong strain
1248,HEROISM,Of setting yours against your grand-sire's brain;
1249,HEROISM,Dangerous risk of walking lone and free
1250,HEROISM,"Out of the easy paths that used to be,"
1251,HEROISM,And the fierce pain of hurting those we love
1252,HEROISM,"When love meets truth, and truth must ride above."
1253,HEROISM,
1254,HEROISM,But the best courage man has ever shown
1255,HEROISM,Is daring to cut loose and think alone.

1262,HEROISM,But to think new--it takes a courage grim
1263,HEROISM,As led Columbus over the world's rim.
1264,HEROISM,To think it cost some courage. And to go--
1265,HEROISM,Try it. It takes every power you know.
1266,HEROISM,
1267,HEROISM,It takes great love to stir the human heart

1269,HEROISM,"A love that is not shallow, is not small,"

1273,HEROISM,"Love that can lose love, family and friend,"
1274,HEROISM,"Yet steadfastly live, loving, to the end."
1275,HEROISM,"A love that asks no answer, that can live"
1276,HEROISM,"Moved by one burning, deathless force--to give."
1277,HEROISM,"Love, strength, and courage; courage, strength, and love."

4022,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"So, without sound of music,"
4023,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"Or voice of them that wept,"
4024,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,Silently down from the mountain crown
4025,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,The great procession swept.
4026,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,
4027,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,Perchance some bald old eagle

4050,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"Where lights like glory fall,"
4051,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,While the sweet choir sings and the organ rings
4052,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,Along the emblazoned wall.
4053,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,
4054,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,This was the bravest warrior
4055,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,That ever buckled sword;
4056,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,This the most gifted poet
4057,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,That ever breathed a word;
4058,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,And never earth's philosopher
4059,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"Traced, with his golden pen,"
4060,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"On the deathless page, truths half so sage"
4061,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,As he wrote down for men.
4062,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,
4063,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,And had he not high honor?
4064,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,The hillside for his pall;
4065,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,To lie in state while angels wait
4066,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,With stars for tapers tall;
4067,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"And the dark rock pines, like tossing plumes,"
4068,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,Over his bier to wave;
4069,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"And God's own hand, in that lonely land,"
4070,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,To lay him in his grave;
4071,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,
4072,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"In that deep grave without a name,"
4073,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,Whence his uncoffined clay
4074,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,Shall break again--most wondrous thought!--
4075,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"Before the judgment day,"
4076,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,"And stand, with glory wrapt around,"

4084,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,And teach them to be still.
4085,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,God hath his mysteries of grace--
4086,THE BURIAL OF MOSES,Ways that we cannot tell;

12782,LONGING,"That some slight good is also wrought,"
12783,LONGING,"Beyond self-satisfaction,"

14121,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14122,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"I walk down the Valley of Silence,"
14123,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"Down the dim, voiceless valley alone!"
14124,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And I hear not the fall of a footstep
14125,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Around me--save God's and my own!
14126,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And the hush of my heart is as holy
14127,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,As hovers where angels have flown.
14128,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14129,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Long ago was I weary of voices
14130,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Whose music my heart could not win;
14131,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Long ago was I weary of noises
14132,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,That fretted my soul with their din;
14133,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Long ago was I weary of places
14134,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Where I met but the human and sin.
14135,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14136,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"And still did I pine for the perfect,"
14137,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And still found the false with the true;
14138,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"I sought 'mid the human for heaven,"
14139,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,But caught a mere glimpse of the blue;
14140,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And I wept when the clouds of the world veiled
14141,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Even _that_ glimpse from my view.
14142,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14143,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"And I toiled on, heart-tired of the human,"
14144,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"And I moaned 'mid the mazes of men,"
14145,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"Till I knelt, long ago, at an altar,"
14146,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And heard a Voice call me. Since then
14147,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,I walk down the Valley of Silence
14148,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,That lies far beyond mortal ken.
14149,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14150,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Do you ask what I found in the Valley?
14151,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,'Tis my trysting place with the Divine.
14152,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"When I fell at the feet of the Holy,"
14153,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"And about me a voice said, ""Be mine,"""
14154,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,There arose from the depths of my spirit
14155,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"An echo: ""My heart shall be thine."""
14156,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14157,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Do you ask how I live in the Valley?
14158,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"I weep, and I dream, and I pray;"
14159,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,But my tears are as sweet as the dew-drops
14160,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,That fall on the roses in May;
14161,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"And my prayer, like a perfume from censer,"
14162,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Ascendeth to God night and day.
14163,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14164,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"In the hush of the Valley of Silence,"
14165,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,I dream all the songs that I sing;
14166,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And the music floats down the dim valley
14167,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"Till each finds a word for a wing,"
14168,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"That to men, like the doves of the deluge"
14169,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,The message of peace they may bring.
14170,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14171,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,But far out on the deep there are billows
14172,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,That never shall break on the beach;
14173,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And I have heard songs in the silence
14174,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,That never shall float into speech;
14175,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And I have had dreams in the valley
14176,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Too lofty for language to reach.
14177,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14178,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And I have seen thoughts in the valley--
14179,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"Ah, me! how my spirit was stirred!"
14180,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And they wear holy veils on their faces--
14181,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Their footsteps can scarcely be heard;
14182,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,They pass through the valley like virgins
14183,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Too pure for the touch of a word.
14184,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,
14185,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"Do you ask me the place of the Valley,"
14186,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,Ye hearts that are harrowed by care?
14187,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"It lieth afar, between mountains,"
14188,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,And God and his angels are there;
14189,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"And one is the dark Mount of Sorrow,"
14190,THE VALLEY OF SILENCE,"The other, the bright Mount of Prayer."

18386,THE SILVER LINING,"But a little cloud appears,"
18387,THE SILVER LINING,There's never a life so happy
18388,THE SILVER LINING,But has its time of tears;
18389,THE SILVER LINING,Yet the sun shines out the brighter
18390,THE SILVER LINING,Whenever the tempest clears.
18391,THE SILVER LINING,
18392,THE SILVER LINING,There's never a garden growing

18394,THE SILVER LINING,There's never a heart so hardened
18395,THE SILVER LINING,But has one tender spot;
18396,THE SILVER LINING,We have only to prune the border
18397,THE SILVER LINING,To find the forget-me-not.
18398,THE SILVER LINING,
18399,THE SILVER LINING,There's never a sun that rises

18413,THE SILVER LINING,There is never a way so narrow

18419,THE SILVER LINING,
18420,THE SILVER LINING,There is never a heart so haughty
18421,THE SILVER LINING,But will some day bow and kneel;

19410,THE LORD'S LEADING,Its trials and its dangers full well himself hath known.
19411,THE LORD'S LEADING,
19412,THE LORD'S LEADING,Thus far the Lord hath led us; the promise hath not failed.
19413,THE LORD'S LEADING,"The enemy, encountered oft, has never quite prevailed:"
19414,THE LORD'S LEADING,"The shield of faith has turned aside, or quenched each fiery dart,"

19426,THE LORD'S LEADING,
19427,THE LORD'S LEADING,Thus far the Lord hath led us; and will he now forsake
19428,THE LORD'S LEADING,The feeble ones whom for his own it pleases him to take?

19437,THE LORD'S LEADING,"Yes, they that know thy name, Lord, shall put their trust in thee,"

19447,THE LORD'S LEADING,Do your joys with age diminish?
19448,THE LORD'S LEADING,When mine fail me I'll complain.
19449,THE LORD'S LEADING,Must in death your daylight finish?

23998,GOD'S PRESENCE,But God is never so far off
23999,GOD'S PRESENCE,As even to be near.
24000,GOD'S PRESENCE,He is within; our spirit is
24001,GOD'S PRESENCE,The home he holds most dear.
24002,GOD'S PRESENCE,
24003,GOD'S PRESENCE,To think of him as by our side
24004,GOD'S PRESENCE,Is almost as untrue
24005,GOD'S PRESENCE,As to remove his throne beyond
24006,GOD'S PRESENCE,Those skies of starry blue.
24007,GOD'S PRESENCE,
24008,GOD'S PRESENCE,So all the while I thought myself
24009,GOD'S PRESENCE,"Homeless, forlorn, and weary,"
24010,GOD'S PRESENCE,"Missing my joy, I walked the earth,"
24011,GOD'S PRESENCE,Myself God's sanctuary.
24012,GOD'S PRESENCE,
24013,GOD'S PRESENCE,"I come to thee once more, my God!"
24014,GOD'S PRESENCE,No longer will I roam;
24015,GOD'S PRESENCE,For I have sought the wide world through
24016,GOD'S PRESENCE,And never found a home.
24017,GOD'S PRESENCE,
24018,GOD'S PRESENCE,Though bright and many are the spots
24019,GOD'S PRESENCE,Where I have built a nest--
24020,GOD'S PRESENCE,Yet in the brightest still I pined
24021,GOD'S PRESENCE,For more abiding rest.
24022,GOD'S PRESENCE,
24023,GOD'S PRESENCE,For thou hast made this wondrous soul
24024,GOD'S PRESENCE,All for thyself alone;
24025,GOD'S PRESENCE,Ah! send thy sweet transforming grace
24026,GOD'S PRESENCE,To make it more thine own.

24046,GOD IS MINE,Their utmost force repel.
24047,GOD IS MINE,
24048,GOD IS MINE,"If he is mine let friends forsake,"
24049,GOD IS MINE,Let wealth and honor flee;
24050,GOD IS MINE,Sure he who giveth me himself
24051,GOD IS MINE,Is more than these to me.
24052,GOD IS MINE,
24053,GOD IS MINE,If he is mine I'll boldly pass
24054,GOD IS MINE,Through death's tremendous vale;
24055,GOD IS MINE,He is a solid comfort when
24056,GOD IS MINE,All other comforts fail.
24057,GOD IS MINE,
24058,GOD IS MINE,"Oh! tell me, Lord, that thou art mine;"

27183,RETROSPECTION,And a rainbow of my tears.
27184,RETROSPECTION,The billows that guarded my sea girt path
27185,RETROSPECTION,But carried my Lord on their crest;
27186,RETROSPECTION,When I dwell on the days of my wilderness march
27187,RETROSPECTION,I can lean on his love for the rest.
27188,RETROSPECTION,
27189,RETROSPECTION,He emptied my hands of my treasured store
27190,RETROSPECTION,And his covenant love revealed;
27191,RETROSPECTION,There was not a wound in my aching heart
27192,RETROSPECTION,But the balm of his breath hath healed.
27193,RETROSPECTION,"Oh! tender and true was the chastening sore,"
27194,RETROSPECTION,"In wisdom, that taught and tried,"
27195,RETROSPECTION,Till the soul that he sought was trusting in him

27199,RETROSPECTION,"By ways that I have not known,"
27200,RETROSPECTION,"The crooked was straight and the rough made plain,"
27201,RETROSPECTION,As I followed the Lord alone.
27202,RETROSPECTION,I praise him still for the pleasant palms
27203,RETROSPECTION,And the water springs by the way;
27204,RETROSPECTION,For the glowing pillars of flame by night
27205,RETROSPECTION,And the sheltering clouds by day.
27206,RETROSPECTION,
27207,RETROSPECTION,There is light for me on the trackless wild
27208,RETROSPECTION,"As the wonders of old I trace,"
