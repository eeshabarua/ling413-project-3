45,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
46,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
47,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,The public interest has been of late years so strongly manifested in
48,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"favour of the poets of the seventeenth century, that little apology"
49,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,appears necessary for the republication of the following Poems. It
50,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"would, however, be equally vain and foolish in the editor to claim for"
51,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"the author a place among the higher class of poets, or to exalt his due"
52,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,praise by depreciating the merits of his contemporaries.—Claiming only
53,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"for Cæsar what to Cæsar is due, it may without arrogance be presumed"
54,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,that these pages will not be found inferior to the poems of others which
55,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"have been fortunately republished, or familiarised to the generality of"
56,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,readers through the popular medium of selections.
57,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
58,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,The author of the following poems (an account of whose life may be
59,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,considered as a necessary appendage to these pages) is said to have
60,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,descended from the antient family of the Corbets in Shropshire. It
61,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,were too laborious and pedantic in a work of this nature to trace his
62,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"pedigree, but I should be pleased to find any proofs of their attachment"
63,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"to him: yet as the bishop did not usually “conceal his love,” I suspect"
64,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"he received no mark of their regard, at least till his elevation"
65,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,conferred rather than received obligation by acknowledgment.
66,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
67,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Richard Corbet, successively bishop of Oxford and Norwich, was born at"
68,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"the village of Ewell in Surrey, in the year 1582: he was the only son"
69,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"of Bennet, or Benedicta, and Vincent Corbet, who, from causes which I"
70,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"have not discovered, assumed the name of Poynter. His father, a man of"
71,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"some eminence for his skill in gardening, and who is celebrated by Ben"
72,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Jonson in an elegy[1] alike honourable to the subject, the poet, and"
73,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"the friend, for his many amiable virtues, resided at Whitton, a hamlet"
74,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"in the parish of Twickenham, where the poet passed his declining days."
75,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,Under the will of his father[2] he inherited sundry freehold lands and
76,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"tenements lying in St. Augustine’s parish, Watling-street, London, and"
77,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"five hundred pounds in money, which was directed to be paid him by"
78,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Bennet, the father’s wife and sole executrix, upon his attaining the"
79,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,age of twenty-five years. After receiving the rudiments of education at
80,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Westminster School, he entered in Lent term 1597-8 at Broadgate Hall,"
81,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"and the year following was admitted a student of Christ-Church College,"
82,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Oxford. In 1605 he proceeded Master of Arts, and became celebrated as a"
83,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,wit and a poet.
84,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
85,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,The following early specimen of his humour is preserved in a collection
86,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"of “Mery Passages and Jeastes,” Harl. MS. No. 6395: “Ben Jonson was at a"
87,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"tavern, and in comes bishop Corbet (but not so then) into the next room."
88,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Ben Jonson calls for a quart of _raw_ wine, and gives it to the tapster."
89,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"‘Sirrah!’ says he, ‘carry this to the gentleman in the next chamber, and"
90,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"tell him I sacrifice my service to him.’ The fellow did, and in those"
91,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"terms. ‘Friend!’ says bishop Corbet, ‘I thank him for his love; but"
92,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"pr’ythee tell him from me that he is mistaken, for sacrifices are always"
93,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,burnt.’”
94,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
95,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"In 1612, upon the death of the amiable and accomplished Henry Prince of"
96,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Wales,"
97,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
98,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"“The expectancy and rose of the fair state,”"
99,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
100,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"and the theme of many a verse; the University, overwhelmed with grief,"
101,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,more especially as he had been a student of Magdalen College under the
102,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"tutorage of Mr. John Wilkinson, (“afterwards the unworthy president of"
103,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"that house,”) and desirous of testifying their respect for his memory,"
104,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"deputed Corbet, then one of the proctors, to pronounce a funeral oration;"
105,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"“who,” to use the words of Antony Wood, “very oratorically speeched it in"
106,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"St. Maries church, before a numerous auditory[3].” On the 13th of March"
107,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,in the following year he performed a similar ceremony in the Divinity
108,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"School on the interment of sir Thomas Bodley, the munificent founder of"
109,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,the library known by his name.
110,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
111,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Amid the religious dissensions at this period, encouraged and increased"
112,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"by James’s suspected inclination to popery, it was scarcely possible to"
113,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,avoid giving offence to the supporters of the various doctrinal opinions
114,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,which in this confusion of faiths divided the people. At the head of the
115,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Church was Dr. George Abbott, a bigoted and captious Puritan: opposed"
116,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"to this disciple of Calvin was Laud, then growing into fame, who boldly"
117,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,supported the opinions of Arminius. With the latter Corbet coincided: but
118,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,the undisguised publication of his faith had nearly proved fatal to his
119,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"future prospects; for, “preaching the Passion sermon at Christ-Church,"
120,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"(1613,) he insisted on the article of Christ’s descending into hell,"
121,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,and therein grated upon Calvin’s manifest perverting of the true sense
122,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"and meaning of it: for which, says Heylyn, he was so rattled up by the"
123,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Repetitioner, (Dr. Robert Abbott, brother of the archbishop,) that if"
124,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"he had not been a man of a very great courage, it might have made him"
125,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"afraid of staying in the University. This, it was generally conceived,"
126,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"was not done without the archbishop’s setting on; but the best was, adds"
127,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Heylyn, that none sunk under the burthen of these oppressions, if (like"
128,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,the camomile) they did not rise the higher by it[4].”
129,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
130,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"When James, in 1605[5], visited Oxford in his summer progress, the wits"
131,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,of the sister University vented their raillery at the entertainment
132,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"given to the royal visitor[6]. Cambridge, which had long solicited the"
133,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"same honour, was in the year 1614-5 indulged with his presence. Many"
134,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,students from Oxford witnessed the ceremonial of his reception; and the
135,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"local histories of the two Universities at that period, are replete"
136,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,with pasquinades and ballads sufficiently descriptive of their mutual
137,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"animosities. An eye-witness declares, “Though I endured a great deal of"
138,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"penance by the way for this little pleasure, yet I would not have missed"
139,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"it, for that I see thereby the partiality of both sides—the Cambridge men"
140,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"pleasing and applauding themselves in all, and the Oxford men as fast"
141,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,condemning and detracting all that was done; wherein yet I commended
142,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Corbet’s modesty, whilst he was there; who being seriously dealt withal"
143,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"by some friends to say what he thought, answered, that he had left"
144,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"his malice and judgment at home, and came there only to commend[7].”"
145,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Notwithstanding this conciliatory declaration, the opportunity of"
146,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,retorting upon the first assailants was too tempting to Corbet’s wit to
147,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"be slighted; and immediately upon his return he composed the ballad, page"
148,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"13, “To the tune of Bonny Nell.”—This humorous narrative excited several"
149,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"replies; the most curious of which was the one, in Latin and English,"
150,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"(at page 24,) written, perhaps, by sir Thomas Lake, afterwards secretary"
151,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"of state, who performed the part of Trico in the Cambridge play of"
152,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Ignoramus, and who had a ring bequeathed him by the author, Ruggles[8]."
153,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
154,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Corbet appears, says Headley[9], to have been of that poetical party"
155,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"who, by inviting Ben Jonson to come to Oxford, rescued him from the arms"
156,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"of a sister University, who has long treated the Muses with indignity,"
157,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,and turned a hostile and disheartening eye on those who have added most
158,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,celebrity to her name[10].
159,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
160,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,We do not find that Ben expressed any regret at the change of his
161,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"situation: companions whose minds and pursuits were similar to his own,"
162,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"are not always to be found in the gross atmosphere of the muddy Cam,"
163,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,though easily met with on the more genial banks of the Isis:
164,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
165,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,Largior hic campos æther.
166,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
167,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,In 1616 he was recommended by the Convocation as a proper person to be
168,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"elected to the college which Dr. Matthew Surtclyve, dean of Exeter,"
169,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"had lately erected at Chelsea, for maintaining polemical Divines to be"
170,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,employed in opposing the doctrines of Papists and Sectaries. Whether he
171,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,obtained his election I have not learned: nor is it of much moment; for
172,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"the establishment, as might be naturally foreseen from the circumstances"
173,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"of the times, soon declined from its original purpose[11]."
174,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
175,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Being now in a situation to indulge his inclinations, he in 1618 made"
176,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"a trip to France, from whence he wrote an “epistle to sir Thomas"
177,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Aylesbury,” in which he gently laughs at his friend’s astronomical"
178,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"fondness; and composed a metrical description of his journey, from which"
179,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"we may conclude that he returned less disgusted with his native country,"
180,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"and less enamoured of the manners and habits of his new acquaintance,"
181,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,than is usual with the modern visitors of our transmarine neighbours.
182,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
183,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"He was now in holy orders; and, in the language of Antony Wood, “became"
184,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"a quaint preacher, and therefore much followed by ingenious men.” None"
185,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"of Corbet’s sermons are, I believe, in existence: the modesty that"
186,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"withheld his poems from the press, during his life, prevented his adding"
187,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,to the multitude of devotional discourses with which the country was
188,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,at this period infested[12]. Those who are at all acquainted with
189,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"the ecclesiastical oratory of James’s reign, will be at no loss to"
190,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"comprehend “honest Antony’s” description; but to those who are not, it"
191,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"may be sufficient to observe, that, of its peculiar excellencies and"
192,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"demerits, the sermons of bishop King, his contemporary, (which have been"
193,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,republished) are a complete “picture in little.”
194,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
195,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"About this time he appears, from the following characteristic letter[13],"
196,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,to have solicited promotion at the hands of Villiers duke of Buckingham:
197,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
198,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,“May it please your Grace
199,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,
200,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,“To consider my two great losses this weeke: one in respect of
201,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,his Majesty to whom I was to preach; the other in respect of my
202,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,patron whom I was to visit. Yf this bee not the way to repare
203,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"the later of my losses, I feare I am in danger to bee utterly"
204,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,undon. To press too neere a greate man is a meanness; to be put
205,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"by, and to stand too far off, is the way to be forgotten: so"
206,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"Ecclesiasticus. In which mediocrity, could I hitt it, would I"
207,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,"live and dy, my lord. I would neather press neere, nor stand"
208,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,far off; choosing rather the name of an ill courtier than a
209,THE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR.,sawsy scholer.

213,“RICHARD CORBET.”,“RICHARD CORBET.”
214,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
215,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Christ’s Church, this 26 Feb."
216,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
217,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"“Heer are newes, my noble lord, about us, that, in the point of"
218,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"alledgeance now in hand, all the Papists are exceeding orthodox; the only"
219,“RICHARD CORBET.”,recusants are the Puritans.”
220,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
221,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Of the nature of the object thus supplicated, my inquiries have not"
222,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"informed me: he was now dean of Christ-Church, vicar of Cassington near"
223,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Woodstock in Oxfordshire, and prebendary of Bedminster secunda in the"
224,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"church of Sarum: it was, perhaps, the appointment of chaplain to the"
225,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"King, which he received about this time; and if to this period may be"
226,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"assigned the gratulatory poem at page 83, it should seem that Buckingham"
227,“RICHARD CORBET.”,was not solicited in vain.
228,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
229,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"In 1619 he sustained a great loss in the decease of his amiable father,"
230,“RICHARD CORBET.”,at a very advanced age; whose praise he has celebrated in the most
231,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"honourable terms, and whose death he has lamented in the language of"
232,“RICHARD CORBET.”,rational and tender regret.
233,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
234,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"When James paid a second visit to Oxford in 1621, Corbet, in his office"
235,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"of chaplain, preached before the monarch[14], who had presented him"
236,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"(as it seems) with a token of his favour, such as flattered in no"
237,“RICHARD CORBET.”,small degree the vanity of the dean. The progress of the court and its
238,“RICHARD CORBET.”,followers is thus ludicrously described in an anonymous poem transcribed
239,“RICHARD CORBET.”,from Antony Wood’s papers[15] in Ashmole’s Museum:
240,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
241,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"The king and the court,"
242,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Desirous of sport,"
243,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Six days at Woodstock did lie;
244,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Thither went the doctors,"
245,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"And sattin-sleev’d proctors,"
246,“RICHARD CORBET.”,With the rest of the learned fry;
247,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
248,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Whose faces did shine
249,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"With beere and with wine,"
250,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"So fat, that it may be thought"
251,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"University cheere,"
252,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"With college strong beere,"
253,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Made them far better fed than taught.
254,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
255,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"A number beside,"
256,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"With their wenches did ride,"
257,“RICHARD CORBET.”,(For scholars are always kind)
258,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"And still evermore,"
259,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"While they rode before,"
260,“RICHARD CORBET.”,They were kissing their wenches behind.
261,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
262,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"A number on foot,"
263,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Without cloak or boot,"
264,“RICHARD CORBET.”,And yet with the court go they would;
265,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Desirous to show
266,“RICHARD CORBET.”,How far they could go
267,“RICHARD CORBET.”,To do his high mightiness good.
268,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
269,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"The reverend Dean,"
270,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"With his band starch’d clean,"
271,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Did preach before the King;
272,“RICHARD CORBET.”,A ring was his pride
273,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"To his bandstrings tied,"
274,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Was not this a pretty thing?
275,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
276,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"The ring, without doubt,"
277,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Was the thing put him out,"
278,“RICHARD CORBET.”,And made him forget what was next;
279,“RICHARD CORBET.”,For every one there
280,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Will say, I dare swear,"
281,“RICHARD CORBET.”,He handled it more than his text.
282,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
283,“RICHARD CORBET.”,With poetical badinage of this complexion the wits of the University of
284,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Oxford, with Corbet at their head, “who loved this boy’s play to the"
285,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"last,” abounded. While many of the pasquinades are lost, many, however,"
286,“RICHARD CORBET.”,are still preserved among Ashmole’s papers: on most occasions Corbet
287,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"was at least a match for his opponents, but this misfortune of the ring"
288,“RICHARD CORBET.”,became a standing jest against him: it is alluded to at page 233; and it
289,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"is demanded in another poem[16], if"
290,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
291,“RICHARD CORBET.”,He would provoke court wits to sing
292,“RICHARD CORBET.”,The _second_ part of bandstrings and the ring.
293,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
294,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Upon the evening of the same Sunday, the students of Christ-Church,"
295,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"willing to show their respect for the royal visitor, obtained leave to"
296,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"present a play before the King; and they chose, with no great display of"
297,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"taste, Barten Holyday’s ΤΕΧΝΟΓΑΜΙΑ, or “The Marriage of the Arts,” which"
298,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"had been acted in Christ-Church hall the 13th of February, 1617. The play"
299,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"was so little relished, that the king was with difficulty persuaded to"
300,“RICHARD CORBET.”,sit till its conclusion: the “enactors” became subjects of ridicule to
301,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"the University; and, though Corbet and King rhymed in their favour, the"
302,“RICHARD CORBET.”,laugh went against them.
303,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
304,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Indeed the Oxonians were not more unfortunate in their theatrical
305,“RICHARD CORBET.”,representations on this than on former occasions. Upon the visit of
306,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"James, in 1605, two out of three dramatic exhibitions, prepared at great"
307,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"expense and performed by the students, were, according to the testimony"
308,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"of an eye-witness, received with tædium, and rewarded with unconcealed"
309,“RICHARD CORBET.”,disgust[17].
310,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
311,“RICHARD CORBET.”,The writers of the poet’s life are silent as to the period of his
312,“RICHARD CORBET.”,marriage; and if I am unable to communicate any information on this
313,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"point, it will not, I trust, be attributed to any parsimony of research,"
314,“RICHARD CORBET.”,or indifference as to fact when conjecture can be substituted. Those who
315,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"have made literary biography their study, know that it is frequently much"
316,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"easier to write many pages than to ascertain a date, and hence but too"
317,“RICHARD CORBET.”,frequently ingenuity supplies the place of labour and inquiry: in the
318,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"present instance, every record that suggested a probability of containing"
319,“RICHARD CORBET.”,any memorial relative to the family of the subject of this biography has
320,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"been inspected personally; but before the passing of the Marriage Act,"
321,“RICHARD CORBET.”,nothing is more uncertain than the probable place of the celebration of
322,“RICHARD CORBET.”,that ceremony[18].
323,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
324,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"In this dearth of fact as to dates, I shall presume to suppose he married"
325,“RICHARD CORBET.”,about 1625 Alice the only daughter of his fellow-collegian Dr. Leonard
326,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Hutton, a man of some eminence in his day as a divine and an antiquary,"
327,“RICHARD CORBET.”,and whose character is thus drawn by Antony Wood with a felicity that
328,“RICHARD CORBET.”,rarely accompanies his pencil: “His younger years were beautified with
329,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"all kind of polite learning, his middle with ingenuity and judgment, and"
330,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"his reverend years with great wisdom in government, having been often"
331,“RICHARD CORBET.”,subdean of his college.”
332,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
333,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"This union of wit and beauty was not looked upon with indifference, nor"
334,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"was their epithalamium unsung, or the string touched by the hand of an"
335,“RICHARD CORBET.”,unskilful master:
336,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
337,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Come, all ye Muses, and rejoyce"
338,“RICHARD CORBET.”,At this your nursling’s happy choyce;
339,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Come, Flora, strew the bridemaid’s bed,"
340,“RICHARD CORBET.”,And with a garland crown her head;
341,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Or, if thy flowers be to seek,"
342,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Come gather roses at her cheek.
343,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Come, Hymen, light thy torches, let"
344,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Thy bed with tapers be beset,"
345,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"And if there be no fire by,"

354,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Of these descendants of the bishop I lament that I have discovered so
355,“RICHARD CORBET.”,little: if this volume should be fortunate enough to excite attention to

361,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Villiers duke of Buckingham, assassinated by Felton on the 23d of"

363,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"and indulgent master, a liberal promoter of literature and science, and"
364,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"to his death an encourager of Corbet’s studies. If, however, this event"
365,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"checked his hopes of promotion for a season, it did not leave him without"
366,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"a patron; for, upon the translation of Hewson to the see of Durham,"
367,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"(to make way for Dr. Duppa to be dean of that church,) he was elected"
368,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"bishop of Oxford the 30th of July, was consecrated at Lambeth the 19th of"
369,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"October, and installed the 3d of November, 1629; “though,” in the opinion"
370,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"of Wood, “in some respects unworthy of such an office[20].”"

372,“RICHARD CORBET.”,Warned by the many petulant remarks on the poetical character scattered
373,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"throughout the account of Oxford writers, one is little surprised at"
374,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"this churlish remark on the part of honest Antony, who seems to have"
375,“RICHARD CORBET.”,considered all poetry as

377,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"... inopes rerum, nugæque canoræ,"
378,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
379,“RICHARD CORBET.”,and its indulgence inconsistent with the clerical profession. Corbet was
380,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"certainly no “precisian,” and perhaps his only fault was possessing a"

383,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"The bishopric of Oxford he held but a short time, being translated to"

385,“RICHARD CORBET.”,dispute arose as to his right of claim to the glebe sown previous to his
386,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"vacating the vicarage: the opinion of the attorney-general, (Noy,) which"
387,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"is preserved in the Harleian collection of manuscripts[21], was in his"

393,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"died, and Laud, who had long exercised the authority of metropolitan,"
394,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"was two days afterwards (August 6th, 1633) preferred to the see of"
395,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Canterbury. Having now “no rival near his throne,” in the warmth of"
396,“RICHARD CORBET.”,his zeal he immediately applied himself to reform abuses and exact
397,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"a conformity to the established church, the discipline of which had"
398,“RICHARD CORBET.”,exceedingly relaxed during the ascendancy of his calvinistic predecessor.
399,“RICHARD CORBET.”,For this purpose Laud issued certain orders and instructions to the
400,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"several bishops, insisting upon a strict examination into the state of"
401,“RICHARD CORBET.”,religion and its ceremonies in their several dioceses; the result of
402,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"which was transmitted to that prelate, and by him laid before the King."
403,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"These representations, many of which are curious, are printed in the"
404,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"nineteenth volume of Rymer’s Fœdera. On his part, Corbet certified that"
405,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"he had suppressed the lectures of some factious men, and particularly"
406,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"that he had suspended one Bridges, curate of St. George’s parish,"
407,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"Norwich; but, upon submission, he had taken off his suspension. Among"
408,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"others, he had heard complaint of Mr. Ward[23], of Ipswich, for words in"

410,“RICHARD CORBET.”,
411,“RICHARD CORBET.”,"From the following conciliating epistle I conclude that Ward submitted,"

433,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,The zeal of Laud did not rest here: he set sedulously about suppressing
434,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"the Dutch and Walloon congregations, of which there were several in"
435,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"London, Norwich, and other places."
436,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
437,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"It will be perhaps necessary to observe, that the Dutch, the Walloons,"
438,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"and the French, who had continued to refuge in England from the reign"
439,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"of Edward the Sixth, had obtained many privileges from former kings,"
440,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"and among others, the liberty of celebrating divine service after"
441,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"their own, that is, the presbyterian, manner. Their congregations were"
442,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,scattered over the kingdom; and at this period there was at Norwich one
443,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"of the Dutch, and one of the Walloons, the latter of which carried on"
444,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"an extensive manufacture of woollen cloths, for the vending of which,"
445,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"they in 1564 obtained a lease of the chapel of St. Mary the Less, which"
446,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,they fitted up as a hall or market-place for that purpose. Where they
447,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"performed divine service before the year 1619 I know not, but in that"
448,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,year Samuel Harsnet licensed the Walloon congregation to use during his
449,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"pleasure the Bishop’s chapel, or chapel of the Virgin Mary[25]. This"
450,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"indulgence was continued during the government of his successor, Francis"
451,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,White. But the intolerance of Laud would be content with nothing short
452,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,of conformity; Corbet consequently prepared to dislodge them by the

483,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"the heterodox, he was equally zealous in supporting the establishment"
484,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"of which he was a dignitary: exertions were now making by the King, the"
485,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"Clergy, and indeed all orders of people, for the restoring Saint Paul’s"
486,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"cathedral, which had remained in ruins since its second destruction by"
487,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"fire, early in Elizabeth’s reign. In 1631 a special commission was"
488,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"issued by the King, for the purpose of collecting money, to be applied"
489,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,to this purpose. The subscription went on tardily till Laud contributed
490,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"a hundred pounds, to be renewed annually, and “Corbet bishop of Norwich"
491,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"(then almoner to the king) giving four hundred pounds, multitudes of"
492,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"others, says Stowe, for eleven years together brought in their monies"
493,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,very plentifully[27].” Nor did his liberality stop here: Wood says[28]
494,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"that in addition to this contribution, which at the time we speak of was"
495,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"an enormous bounty, he gave money to many needy ministers, thereby to"
496,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,excite the donations of their wealthier brethren; and he pronounced the
497,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"following admonitory, persuasive and satirical address[29] to the clergy"
498,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,of his diocese:
499,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
500,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,“Saint Paul’s church! One word in the behalf of Saint Paul; he hath
501,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,spoken many in ours: he hath raised our inward temples. Let us help to
502,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,requite him in his outward. We admire commonly those things which are
503,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"oldest and greatest: old monuments, and high buildings, do affect us"
504,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,above measure: and what is the reason? Because what is oldest cometh
505,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"nearest God for antiquity: and what is greatest, comes nearest his works"
506,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,for spaciousness and magnitude: so that in honouring these we honour
507,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"God, whom old and great do seem to imitate. Should I commend Paul’s to"
508,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"you for the age, it were worth your thought and admiration. A thousand"
509,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"years, though it should fall now, were a pretty climacterical. See the"
510,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"bigness, and your eye never yet beheld such a goodly object. It’s worth"
511,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"the reparation, though it were but for a land mark; but, beloved, it is a"
512,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"church, and consecrated to God. From Charles to Ethelbert she hath been"
513,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,the joy of princes. It was once dedicated to Diana (at least some part of
514,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,it); but the idolatry lasted not long. And see a mystery in the change:
515,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"Saint Paul confuting twice the idol, there in person, where the cry was,"
516,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"‘Great is Diana of the Ephesians!’ and here: by proxy. Paul installed,"
517,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"where Diana is thrust out. It did magnify the creation, it was taken"
518,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"out of the darkness: light is not the clearer for it, but stronger and"
519,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"more wonderful: and it doth beautify this church, because it was taken"
520,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"from pollution. The stones are not the more durable, but the happier"
521,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"for it. It is worthy the standing for the age, the time since it was"
522,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"built, and for the structure, so stately an edifice is it: it is worthy"
523,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"to stand for a memorial of it from which it is redeemed, but chiefly for"
524,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"his house that dwells therein. We are bound to do it, for the service"
525,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"sake that is done in it. Are we not beholden to it, every man, either to"

632,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"His person, if we may rely upon a fine portrait of him in the hall of"
633,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"Christ-Church, Oxford, was dignified, and his frame above the common"
634,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,size: one of his companions[31] says he had
635,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
636,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,A face that might heaven to affection draw:

640,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
641,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,In no record of his life is there the slightest trace of malevolence or
642,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"tyranny: “he was,” says Fullers[32], “of a courteous carriage, and no"
643,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"destructive nature to any who offended him, counting himself plentifully"
644,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"repaired with a jest upon him.” Benevolent, generous and spirited in his"
645,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"public character; sincere, amiable, and affectionate in private life;"
646,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"correct, eloquent, and ingenious as a poet; he appears to have deserved"
647,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"and enjoyed through life the patronage and friendship of the great, and"
648,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,the applause and estimation of the good.
649,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
650,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"Apology is not necessary for his writings, or it might be urged that"
651,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,they were not intended for publication by their author. “His merits are
652,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"disclosed,” and, at the distance of near a century and a half, are now"
653,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,again submitted to the censure of the public.

655,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"His panegyric is liberal without grossness, and complimentary without"
656,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"servility: his satires on the Puritans, a pestilent race which Corbet"
657,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"fortunately did not live to see ascendant, and which soon after his"
658,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,decease sunk literature and the arts in “the Serbonian bog” of ignorance
659,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"and fanaticism, evince his skill in severe and ludicrous reproof; and"
660,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"the addresses to his son and his parents, while they are proofs of his"
661,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"filial and parental regard, bear testimony to his command over the finer"
662,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"feelings. But the predominant faculty of his mind was wit, which he"
663,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,employed with most success when directed ironically: of this the address
664,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"“to the Ghost of Wisdome,” and “the Distracted Puritane,” are memorable"
665,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"examples. Indeed he was unable to overcome his talent for humour, even"
666,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,when circumstance and character concurred to repress its indulgence. Of
667,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"this propensity the following anecdotes, copied _verbatim_ from Aubrey’s"
668,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"MSS. in Mus. Ashmole[33], are curious proofs, and may not improperly"
669,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,close this account of a character which they tend forcibly to illustrate.
670,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
671,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"“After he was doctor of divinity, he sang ballads at the Crosse at"
672,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,Abingdon; on a market-day he and some of his comrades were at the taverne
673,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"by the Crosse, (which, by the way, was then the finest of England; I"
674,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,remember it when I was a freshman; it was admirable curious Gothicque
675,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"architecture, and fine figures in the nitches; ’twas one of those built"
676,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,by king ... for his queen.) The ballad-singer complayned he had no
677,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,custome—he could not put off his ballads. The jolly Doctor puts off his
678,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"gowne, and puts on the ballad-singer’s leathern jacket, and being a"
679,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"handsome man, and a rare full voice, he presently vended a great many,"
680,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,and had a great audience.
681,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
682,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"“After the death of Dr. Goodwin, he was made deane of Christ-Church. He"
683,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"had a good interest with great men, as you may finde in his poems; and"
684,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"that with the then great favourite the duke of Bucks, his excellent wit"
685,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,ever ’twas of recommendation to him. I have forgot the story; but at the
686,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"same time Dr. Fell thought to have carried it, Dr. Corbet put a pretty"
687,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"trick on him to let him take a journey to London for it, when he had"
688,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,alreadie the graunt of it.
689,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
690,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,“His conversation was extreme pleasant. Dr. Stubbins was one of his
691,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"cronies; he was a jolly fat doctor, and a very good housekeeper. As"
692,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"Dr. Corbet and he were riding in Lob-lane in wet weather, (’tis an"
693,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"extraordinary deepe dirty lane,) the coach fell, and Corbet said, that"
694,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"Dr. S. was up to the elbows in mud, and he was up to the elbows in"

696,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
697,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"“A. D. 1628, he was made bishop of Oxford; and I have heard that he had"

700,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"“One time as he was confirming, the country people pressing in to see"
701,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"the ceremonie, said he, ‘Beare off there! or I’ll confirm ye with my"
702,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"staffe.’—Another time, being to lay his hand on the head of a man very"
703,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"bald, he turns to his chaplaine, and said, ‘Some dust, Lushington,’ to"
704,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,keepe his hand from slipping.—There was a man with a great venerable
705,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"beard; said the bishop, ‘You, behind the beard!’"
706,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,
707,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"“His chaplaine, Dr. Lushington, was a very learned and ingenious man, and"
708,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,they loved one another. The Bishop would sometimes take the key of the
709,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"wine-cellar, and he and his chaplaine would go and lock themselves in"
710,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"and be merry; then first he layes down his episcopal hood, ‘There layes"
711,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"the doctor;’ then he putts off his gowne, ‘There layes the bishop;’ then"
712,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"’twas, ‘Here’s to thee, Corbet;’—‘Here’s to thee, Lushington.’”"

714,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"One word on the subject of the former editions; which bear dates 1647,"
715,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"1648, and 1672. The first and last impressions correspond in their"
716,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"contents, and the publisher of the latter has also copied, for the most"
717,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"part, the errors of his predecessor, which are so numerous as to render"
718,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"the poems not unfrequently unintelligible. I must observe, however,"
719,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"from the information of Mr. Park, that many copies of the first edition"
720,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,conclude at page 53. The additions extend the volume to 85 pages. The
721,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"only impression with any pretension to accuracy is that of 1648, which,"
722,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,"from its internal evidence, I suspect was published under the eye of the"
723,“RICH. NORWICH[24].”,Bishop’s family; I have therefore retained the Preface. It contains only

1817,LADY ARABELLA STUART.,"brought up in privacy under the care of her grandmother, the old countess"

1821,LADY ARABELLA STUART.,"of her leaving a legitimate offspring. The former, therefore, prevented"
1822,LADY ARABELLA STUART.,"her from marrying Esme Stuart, her kinsman, and heir to the titles and"

1825,LADY ARABELLA STUART.,"by obliging her to reject many splendid offers of marriage, unwarily"

1831,LADY ARABELLA STUART.,"James meant to avoid; for the lady, sensible that her reputation had"
1832,LADY ARABELLA STUART.,"been wounded by this inquiry, was in a manner forced into a marriage;"
1833,LADY ARABELLA STUART.,"which becoming publicly known in the course of the next spring, she was"

3601,ITER BOREALE,"journey into Worcestershire” (page 215. fol. edit.) in a similar vein,"
3602,ITER BOREALE,says Headley. If the popularity of this poem may be estimated by the
3603,ITER BOREALE,"frequency of manuscript copies in the public libraries, we may conclude"
3604,ITER BOREALE,"it was valued very highly, as the transcripts of it are very numerous."
3605,ITER BOREALE,
3606,ITER BOREALE,"Misled by one of these, I considered this poem, the longest and most"
3607,ITER BOREALE,"celebrated of bishop Corbet’s productions, to have been written in"
3608,ITER BOREALE,1625: subsequent examination has induced me to place the date of its
3609,ITER BOREALE,composition considerably earlier: the reasons on which this opinion is
3610,ITER BOREALE,"grounded, will be detailed in the following analysis of the Tour."
3611,ITER BOREALE,
3612,ITER BOREALE,Our author commences his journey from Oxford in a company consisting
3613,ITER BOREALE,"of four persons, two of whom then were, and two of whom wished to be,"
3614,ITER BOREALE,doctors: but there is nothing in the course of the tour to show us
3615,ITER BOREALE,"which of the classes he belonged to, unless we are to suppose, from the"
3616,ITER BOREALE,shortness of cash which discovers itself before the termination of his
3617,ITER BOREALE,"adventures, that he was rather one of those who had wealth in expectancy"
3618,ITER BOREALE,than in possession.

3624,ITER BOREALE,"They set off on the 10th of August, and, long as the days are about that"
3625,ITER BOREALE,"period, had a good chance of sharpening their appetites by their first"
3626,ITER BOREALE,"half-day’s ride, thirty miles before dinner, when they sat down to dine"
3627,ITER BOREALE,"with Dr. Christopher Middleton, at his rectory of Ashton on the Wall in"
3628,ITER BOREALE,"Northamptonshire, about eight miles north of Banbury; where we learn that"
3629,ITER BOREALE,"their entertainment was better than the looks of their host, whom they"
3630,ITER BOREALE,"left in the evening, and rode to Flore, about twelve miles north-east,"
3631,ITER BOREALE,and took up their lodgings for the night.
3632,ITER BOREALE,
3633,ITER BOREALE,"At Flore they were entertained by a country surgeon, or (in the vulgar"
3634,ITER BOREALE,"phrase) bone-setter, the tenant of Dr. Leonard Hutton, the rector of"
3635,ITER BOREALE,"Flore and dean of Christ-Church, who fed them upon venison."

3639,ITER BOREALE,"The third morning they set off for Daventry, about five miles. Here it"
3640,ITER BOREALE,happened to be the market- and lecture-day: and after having washed down
3641,ITER BOREALE,"the dust which their throats had acquired in the ride, one of them was"
3642,ITER BOREALE,summoned by the serjeant at mace to deliver the lecture; for which they
3643,ITER BOREALE,were all rewarded with thanks and wine.

3648,ITER BOREALE,
3649,ITER BOREALE,"The fourth morning they rode to Lutterworth in Leicestershire, about"
3650,ITER BOREALE,"sixteen miles. This was once the benefice of Wickliffe, the father of"
3651,ITER BOREALE,English reformers; and here the tourist very properly remarks on the
3652,ITER BOREALE,"double injustice done to that venerable character, first by the Papists"
3653,ITER BOREALE,"in burning his body, and afterwards by the Puritans in destroying the"
3654,ITER BOREALE,sacred memorial of the interment of his ashes. At Lutterworth they were
3655,ITER BOREALE,"met by a parson, who though well-beneficed was better-mannered, and was"
3656,ITER BOREALE,their guide to his dwelling within a mile of Leicester. A note on the
3657,ITER BOREALE,older editions of Corbet calls this gentleman the Parson of Heathcot:
3658,ITER BOREALE,but there is no place of the name of Heathcot in that neighbourhood;
3659,ITER BOREALE,"and as, by comparison with other parts of the tour in which miles are"
3660,ITER BOREALE,"mentioned, one mile will be invariably found to signify one and a half at"
3661,ITER BOREALE,the least; and as less than two reputed miles is accounted only one mile
3662,ITER BOREALE,"in the distance of places, I presume it was Ayleston, and not Heathcot,"
3663,ITER BOREALE,"where the party rested, and were regaled with stale beer. At length they"
3664,ITER BOREALE,"arrived at Leicester, thirteen miles north of Lutterworth, where, passing"
3665,ITER BOREALE,"over six steeples and two hospitals, (“one hospital twice told,”)"
3666,ITER BOREALE,"which he refers to the eye of Camden, he censures the ignorance of the"
3667,ITER BOREALE,"alms-man, who, notwithstanding it was written on the walls that Henry"
3668,ITER BOREALE,"of Grisemont laid the foundation, told them it was John of Gaunt. Henry"
3669,ITER BOREALE,"Plantagenet, earl of Lancaster, was the first founder of the hospital"
3670,ITER BOREALE,"in the Newark at Leicester in the year 1330, which was considerably"
3671,ITER BOREALE,"enlarged and improved, and converted into a college by his son Henry, the"
3672,ITER BOREALE,"good duke of Lancaster, in 1355; but there is a more general sense in"
3673,ITER BOREALE,"which the word Founder is used, namely, that in which it is extended to"
3674,ITER BOREALE,"all those who inherit, either by descent or by purchase, the patronage"
3675,ITER BOREALE,under the original founder. And in this sense it may be applied to John
3676,ITER BOREALE,"of Gaunt, the second duke of Lancaster, who married his near kinswoman"
3677,ITER BOREALE,"the heiress of the former duke, and perfected both in buildings and"
3678,ITER BOREALE,"endowments what the others had commenced. The other hospital alluded to,"
3679,ITER BOREALE,"is that founded by William Wigston, merchant of the Staple, about 1520."
3680,ITER BOREALE,
3681,ITER BOREALE,"The tourist next observes on the extortion of the innkeeper, who,"
3682,ITER BOREALE,reckoning by the number of his guests rather than the goodness of his
3683,ITER BOREALE,"provision, charged them seven shillings and sixpence for bread and beer;"
3684,ITER BOREALE,"but, after a kindly caution to the publican to forbear such cozenage upon"
3685,ITER BOREALE,"Divines in future, lest they should be suspected of drinking as freely"
3686,ITER BOREALE,"as he charges them, turns from a subject so unworthy of his Pegasus in"
3687,ITER BOREALE,"disgust, and inquires if this be not the burial-place of Richard the"
3688,ITER BOREALE,"Third; and, finding that there is no memorial for him, moralizes upon the"
3689,ITER BOREALE,"neglected state in which he lies, as the eventual fate of all greatness:"
3690,ITER BOREALE,"then from Richard proceeds to Wolsey, who was also buried at Leicester,"
3691,ITER BOREALE,"and produces similar reflections; and from Wolsey, to William the ostler"
3692,ITER BOREALE,"of the inn, who outdoes the company in years as well as drink, and calls"
3693,ITER BOREALE,them to horse as imperiously as if he had a warrant from the earl of
3694,ITER BOREALE,Nottingham.
3695,ITER BOREALE,
3696,ITER BOREALE,The earl of Nottingham here glanced at was Charles lord Howard of
3697,ITER BOREALE,"Effingham, lord high admiral of England under queen Elizabeth and king"
3698,ITER BOREALE,James the First. He died in 1624.

3701,ITER BOREALE,
3702,ITER BOREALE,From Leicester to Nottingham (twenty-five miles) the travellers pass
3703,ITER BOREALE,"without noticing any thing on their way, until approaching the latter"
3704,ITER BOREALE,"place they cross the Trent, pray to St. Andrew as they ride up hill, into"
3705,ITER BOREALE,"the town, and observe that the people burrow, like conies, in caverns,"
3706,ITER BOREALE,from whence the smoke ascends at the feet of the woman who stands on the
3707,ITER BOREALE,"surface watching, down the chimney, the cooking of her dinner. The part"
3708,ITER BOREALE,"of the town at which they enter is described as the Rocky Parish, higher"
3709,ITER BOREALE,"than the rest; and the church of St. Mary, as embracing her Baby in her"
3710,ITER BOREALE,"arms. From hence they proceed to the Castle, which is described as a"
3711,ITER BOREALE,"ruin, with two statues of giants at the gates, whom the tourist severely"
3712,ITER BOREALE,"censures for their negligence in permitting their charge to come to ruin,"
3713,ITER BOREALE,and reproaches them with the fidelity of the giants at Guildhall and
3714,ITER BOREALE,"Holmeby, who had carefully kept the buildings committed to their charge"
3715,ITER BOREALE,when the founders were dead. The poet might still compliment the giants
3716,ITER BOREALE,"at Guildhall; but of Holmeby (Holdenby House, Northamptonshire, built"
3717,ITER BOREALE,"by queen Elizabeth’s lord chancellor, sir Christopher Hatton,) not one"
3718,ITER BOREALE,"stone remains upon another: nay, the very memory of the giants might have"
3719,ITER BOREALE,perished but for the Iter Boreale.
3720,ITER BOREALE,
3721,ITER BOREALE,"The travellers then go to dinner at the Bull’s Head, where the archbishop"
3722,ITER BOREALE,"of York had been before them, and where their discontent with bed and"
3723,ITER BOREALE,diet was answered by a reference to the satisfaction which _he_ had
3724,ITER BOREALE,"received; and where the aged landlord, formerly an ostler, is noticed as"
3725,ITER BOREALE,a rare example to those who have an itch for gold.
3726,ITER BOREALE,
3727,ITER BOREALE,[Sidenote: 20]
3728,ITER BOREALE,
3729,ITER BOREALE,"Their next stage was to Newark, (about twenty miles, or, according to"
3730,ITER BOREALE,"the reckoning of the poet, twelve), which is spoken of as no journey,"
3731,ITER BOREALE,"but only a walk; and the banks of the Trent as so fertile and beautiful,"
3732,ITER BOREALE,that the English river takes away the palm from the celebrated Meander.
3733,ITER BOREALE,The pleasure of this part of their journey was not diminished by their
3734,ITER BOREALE,"reception at Newark, where they met with a friend, out of respect to whom"
3735,ITER BOREALE,the town united as a family to give the travellers a hearty welcome; and
3736,ITER BOREALE,even the landlord of one inn did not repine that they had passed his
3737,ITER BOREALE,"house to go to another, and the landlord of the inn where they rested"
3738,ITER BOREALE,was more solicitous of their approbation than his own profit. The very
3739,ITER BOREALE,"beggars rather prayed for their friend than begged of his guests, and the"
3740,ITER BOREALE,"Puritans were willing to “let the organs play,” if the visitors would"
3741,ITER BOREALE,tarry.
3742,ITER BOREALE,
3743,ITER BOREALE,"From Newark they saw Bever (Belvoir) and Lincoln, and would fain have"
3744,ITER BOREALE,gone there but for the limitation on their purse and horses. At three
3745,ITER BOREALE,"o’clock they set off, with twenty (thirty) miles to ride, (probably to"
3746,ITER BOREALE,"Melton Mowbray); and having neither guide, nor horse of speed, after"
3747,ITER BOREALE,"losing their way, two hours after sun-set blundered upon a village, from"
3748,ITER BOREALE,whence they obtained a guide to Loughborough. From thence they set off
3749,ITER BOREALE,"next morning for Bosworth, (eighteen miles,) but in their way thither"
3750,ITER BOREALE,"are lost in Charley Forest, and ask their way from the travellers they"
3751,ITER BOREALE,"meet about the coal-mines at Coalorton, without receiving an answer; when"
3752,ITER BOREALE,"William, their attendant, seeing a man approach, imagines himself to be"
3753,ITER BOREALE,in Fairyland. But the party are agreeably surprised by finding him one of
3754,ITER BOREALE,"the keepers of the forest, who conducts them within view of Bosworth."
3755,ITER BOREALE,
3756,ITER BOREALE,At Bosworth they meet with far better treatment than the appearance
3757,ITER BOREALE,"of the place had promised; and, when their host there, who was their"
3758,ITER BOREALE,"guide the next morning, brought them near to the field on which the"
3759,ITER BOREALE,"battle of Bosworth was fought, are greatly amused by his romantic"
3760,ITER BOREALE,description of the battle. The guide seems to leave them at Nuneaton in
3761,ITER BOREALE,"Warwickshire, six miles (about nine) from Bosworth; from whence they"
3762,ITER BOREALE,"proceed to Coventry, nine miles; and from thence, having scarcely had"
3763,ITER BOREALE,"time to dine, depart for Kenilworth, five miles, where they are offended"
3764,ITER BOREALE,"by the indecency of an aged parson, who attended the servant of the"
3765,ITER BOREALE,"lord Leicester, it is presumed, to show them the Castle. The Castle of"
3766,ITER BOREALE,"Kenilworth was once the splendid residence of Robert Dudley, earl of"
3767,ITER BOREALE,"Leicester, one of the favourites of queen Elizabeth, and on his death,"
3768,ITER BOREALE,"in 1588, passed to his son, Robert Dudley, who used the title of earl"
3769,ITER BOREALE,"of Leicester,—but by a decree of the Star-Chamber was declared to be"
3770,ITER BOREALE,"illegitimate, and from disgust at that sentence retired into Italy, under"
3771,ITER BOREALE,"a license for three years; and being summoned by the privy-council, at"
3772,ITER BOREALE,"the instigation of his enemies, to return into England, and refusing to"
3773,ITER BOREALE,"obey the summons, the Castle of Kenilworth was, for his contumacy, seized"
3774,ITER BOREALE,"by the Crown under the statute of Fugitives; and Henry prince of Wales,"
3775,ITER BOREALE,"in the year 1611, purchased a release of the inheritance of it from sir"
3776,ITER BOREALE,"Robert Dudley, who was to have the constableship of the Castle, under"
3777,ITER BOREALE,"prince Henry, for life. It does not appear, however, that sir Robert"
3778,ITER BOREALE,Dudley resided at Kenilworth afterwards: he probably had little regard
3779,ITER BOREALE,for a place of which he had been compelled to relinquish the inheritance.
3780,ITER BOREALE,This may account for the neglected state in which it was found by our
3781,ITER BOREALE,poet and his companions.
3782,ITER BOREALE,
3783,ITER BOREALE,"From Kenilworth they proceed to Warwick, three (five) miles, noticing"
3784,ITER BOREALE,"in their way the Cave of the celebrated hero of English romance, Guy"
3785,ITER BOREALE,"earl of Warwick, as also his Pillar: and at Warwick we have a humorous"
3786,ITER BOREALE,description of the landlady of the inn. From the inn they proceed to the
3787,ITER BOREALE,"Castle, where they are received by “the lord of all this frame, the"
3788,ITER BOREALE,"honourable Chancellor,” whose politeness and elegance of manners receive"
3789,ITER BOREALE,favourable notice. Sir Fulk Greville obtained a grant of Warwick Castle
3790,ITER BOREALE,"from king James the First, in the second year of his reign, (1604,)"
3791,ITER BOREALE,and was about the same time appointed chancellor of the exchequer; and
3792,ITER BOREALE,"resigned his office of chancellor, on being elevated to the peerage by"
3793,ITER BOREALE,"the title of lord Brooke, 19th of January, 1620-21. It may be observed,"
3794,ITER BOREALE,"that the author of the Iter notices him as an honourable chancellor, not"
3795,ITER BOREALE,as noble lord; which he certainly would have done if the Iter had not
3796,ITER BOREALE,been of an earlier date than 1621.
3797,ITER BOREALE,
3798,ITER BOREALE,"With sir Fulk Greville they found a prelate of the church, an archdeacon,"
3799,ITER BOREALE,"whom a note in the old editions calls archdeacon Burton. This, I presume,"
3800,ITER BOREALE,"was Samuel Burton, A. M. of Christ-Church, Oxford, who paid first-fruits"
3801,ITER BOREALE,"for the archdeaconry of Gloucester, in the cathedral of Gloucester, the"
3802,ITER BOREALE,"9th of May, 1607, and died the 14th of June, 1634, and was buried at"
3803,ITER BOREALE,Dry-Drayton in Gloucestershire. He is described as sufficiently corpulent
3804,ITER BOREALE,"to deserve the displeasure of the Puritans, whom our author never loses"
3805,ITER BOREALE,an opportunity of lashing.
3806,ITER BOREALE,
3807,ITER BOREALE,"From Warwick they arrive at Flore, (about twenty-one miles,) having been"
3808,ITER BOREALE,"able to make both ends (of their purse) meet; and, after staying there"
3809,ITER BOREALE,"four days, arrive at Banbury on St. Bartholomew’s day, (24th of August,)"
3810,ITER BOREALE,desirous to see what sport the saint would produce there. At this place
3811,ITER BOREALE,(where they rested at the sign of the Altar-Stone) the tourist finds
3812,ITER BOREALE,"the altar converted into an inn, and, judging by the sign, lodged in a"
3813,ITER BOREALE,"chapel, but, by the wine, in a bankrupt tavern; and yet, by the coffins"
3814,ITER BOREALE,"converted into horse-troughs, a church. But though you may judge, by what"
3815,ITER BOREALE,"is found at the inn, that the church is full of monuments, you will be"
3816,ITER BOREALE,disappointed; for there was not an inscription in the church except the
3817,ITER BOREALE,"names of the last year’s churchwardens,—with buckets and cobwebs hanging,"
3818,ITER BOREALE,"instead of painted saints, in the windows. In short, the town seems to"
3819,ITER BOREALE,have been a strange collection of sectaries differing from each other.
3820,ITER BOREALE,
3821,ITER BOREALE,"From hence he returns to Oxford, twenty-two miles, with as little coin in"
3822,ITER BOREALE,his purse as sir Walter Raleigh brought from his unsuccessful expedition
3823,ITER BOREALE,to Guiana in 1618; between which period and 1621 it is clear the poem was

4875,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,
4876,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"Are much admired, says the provincial historian of Glocestershire,"
4877,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,for their excellent painted glass. There are twenty-eight large
4878,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"windows, which are curiously painted with the stories of the Old and"
4879,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"New Testament: the middle windows in the choir, and on the west side"
4880,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"of the church, are larger than the rest; those in the choir represent"
4881,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,the history of our Saviour’s Crucifixion; the window at the west end
4882,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"represents Hell and Damnation; those on the side of the church, and over"
4883,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"the body, represent the figures in length of the prophets, apostles,"
4884,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"fathers, martyrs and confessors, and also the persecutors of the church."
4885,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"The painting was designed by Albert Durer, an eminent Italian Master: the"
4886,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"colours are very lively, especially in the drapery: some of the figures"
4887,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"are so well finished, that sir Anthony Vandyke affirmed that the pencil"
4888,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,could not exceed them. This curious painting was preserved from zealous
4889,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"fury in the great rebellion, by turning the glass upside down."
4890,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,
4891,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"John Tame, esq. founded this church in the year 1493. He was a merchant,"
4892,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"and took a prize-ship bound for Rome, in which was this painted glass: he"
4893,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"brought both the glass and workmen into England, built the church for the"
4894,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,"sake of the glass, and dedicated it to the Virgin Mary."

4901,FAIRFORD WINDOWS,windows were put up; nor is it probable that he had then attained to such
