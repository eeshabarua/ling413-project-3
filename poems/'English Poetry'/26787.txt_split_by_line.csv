31,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
32,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
33,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Sir Alf he is an Atheling,"
34,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Both at Stevn and at Ting. {5}
35,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,_Know ye little Alf_?
36,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
37,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Alf he builds a vessel stout,"
38,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,For he will rove and sail about.
39,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
40,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Alf he builds a vessel high,"
41,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,The trade of pirate he will try.
42,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
43,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"He draws on the sand a circle mark,"
44,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And with a bound he gained the bark.
45,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
46,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Upon the prow Alf foremost stood,"
47,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And Copenhagen’s koggers view’d.
48,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
49,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"O’er the wide sea he flung a look,"
50,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,He knew the course the vessels took.
51,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
52,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“There koggers nine salute mine eyes,"
53,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"All, all they bear shall be my prize.”"
54,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
55,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Alone into a boat he goes,"
56,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And briskly to the koggers rows.
57,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
58,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Well met, ye Courtmen, clad in mail"
59,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Unto what haven do ye sail?”
60,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
61,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Unto that haven we are bound,"
62,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Where Alf is likeliest to be found.”
63,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
64,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,“What will ye on the man bestow
65,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Who unto ye Sir Alf can show?”
66,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
67,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Silver and gold to him we’ll give,"
68,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,All he can wish for shall he receive.
69,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
70,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Presents of worth he shall not miss,"
71,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,The robber’s vessel shall be his.”
72,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
73,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“And what shall be the pirates’ lot,"
74,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,If Alf the pirate escape you not?”
75,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
76,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“His mariners we’ll hew and slay,"
77,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Himself we will in irons lay.”
78,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
79,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Ha! little Alf ye here may see,"
80,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Slight victory ye shall win from me!”
81,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
82,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Up, up and board, my gallant crew,"
83,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Cable and rope asunder hew!”
84,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
85,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Till he was weary Alf he hew’d,"
86,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,In fifteen Courtmen’s gore he stood.
87,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
88,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"He captured all the koggers nine,"
89,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And sailed for Norway o’er the brine.
90,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
91,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"To Rostock in the tiding goes,"
92,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Then palened many a cheek of rose.
93,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
94,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Widow and child lamented sore,"
95,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,This hurtful hawk had made them poor.
96,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
97,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"But they must thole this damage all,"
98,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Their tears but bootless, bootless fall."

105,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,_Song the Second_
106,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
107,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
108,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Sir Alf will not stay in Norroway land,"
109,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,For he passes his time there wearily;
110,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Full fifteen lordships in fief he holds,"
111,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,He can live thereout right merrily.
112,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
113,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Sir Alf he walks on the verdant wold,"
114,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Conning his breviary;
115,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"There meets him Bendit Rimaardson,"
116,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,For God of his sins was weary.
117,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
118,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Good morrow, good day, thou little Sir Alf,"
119,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Thou art a valiant noble,"
120,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"But if thou become the King’s prisoner to-day,"
121,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,The land will know less trouble.”
122,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
123,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“I am not the little Sir Alf,"
124,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,I vow by the holy Mary;
125,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"I am but a little mass-boy, Sir,"
126,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,To the priest the wine I carry!”
127,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
128,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Bendit lifted his high, high hat,"
129,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"And upon his visage staring,"
130,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Said: “Thou art the little Norwegian Alf,"
131,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,If mine eyes are the truth declaring.
132,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
133,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Thou wast a school boy along with me,"
134,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Thou darest not deny it;
135,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"And well at the school I remember thee,"
136,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Thou gavest us no quiet.”
137,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
138,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“If thou be Bendit Rimaardson,"
139,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Thou art my near relation;
140,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"If to-day thou wilt swear thou knowest me not,"
141,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Thou wilt do me an obligation.”
142,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
143,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"But straight they took the little Sir Alf,"
144,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And gyves to his legs they fastened;
145,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"And away, away to Helsingborg,"
146,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,With the captive Alf they hastened.
147,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
148,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Now take little Alf to the chamber high,"
149,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"To the hall of the regal tower,"
150,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"That the Queen at her ease, and her maids, if they please."
151,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,May behold this thief of power.”
152,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
153,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Then up and spake the Danish Queen,"
154,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,On first little Alf espying:
155,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“The man that I see cannot surely be he,"
156,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Whose fame through the world is flying.”
157,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
158,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Though I of stature be little and mean,"
159,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"I’ve every manly talent,"
160,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"And ne’er wilt thou bear thy lord an heir,"
161,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Half, half so good and gallant."
162,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
163,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“I’d give my mantle with roses red,"
164,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"And lilies flowered over,"
165,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"If I might sleep one night with thee,"
166,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And play the ardent lover.
167,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
168,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“If I one night with thee might sleep,"
169,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"None knowing but thy maid servant,"
170,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"For then, I ween, thou would’st beg, fair Queen,"
171,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,For my pardon in accents fervent.”
172,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
173,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Then answered him the Danish Queen,"
174,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,As she struck the board with vigour:
175,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“To-morrow, ere folk to breakfast go,"
176,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,On a gibbet thou shalt figure!”
177,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
178,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Why hang’st thou not Ivor of Holsterbro,"
179,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And Canute of Sonderboro?
180,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"They were thieves like me, but they slept with thee,"
181,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And their death would have caused thee sorrow.”
182,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
183,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Then they took away the little Sir Alf
184,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,From the hall of the regal tower;
185,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,For the beauteous Queen and her ladies had seen
186,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Enough of this thief of power.
187,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
188,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,They led the little Count Sir Alf
189,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Out East from Helsing city;
190,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"With contrite breast he his sins confess’d,"
191,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And to God he cried for pity.
192,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
193,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Now I counsel each noble woman’s son,"
194,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"He in honour’s courses guide him,"
195,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"With his equals dwell in the land, for well"
196,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,With all will that land provide him.
197,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
198,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,“For many a day and many a year
199,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"I’ve plundered, as every one knoweth;"
200,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,But what we win with injustice and sin
201,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,With shame and sorrow goeth.
202,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
203,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“A Count was I, of Erling’s race,"
204,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,O’er Timsberg’s rich fief I lorded;
205,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"That filled me with pride, and my will I would have,"
206,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Though my will with no law accorded.
207,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
208,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“First, first on all who my hate had won"
209,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,I murders foul committed;
210,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Then to wife and maid no respect I paid,"
211,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,But shamefully them I treated.
212,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
213,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,“From the needy citizen his goods
214,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And his life besides I’ve riven;
215,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Widow and orphans my deeds bemoan,"
216,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And for vengeance cry to heaven.
217,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,
218,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"“Lord God to me kind and clement be,"
219,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,And grant me this petition:
220,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,"Let me gain, when this death of shame I’ve thol’d,"
221,SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER,Into endless life admission.”

226,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.
227,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
228,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
229,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,“O what shall I in Denmark do?
230,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,To bear your armour I’m too weak;
231,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"The Danish warriors jeer at me,"
232,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Because their tongue I cannot speak.”
233,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
234,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"It was the young Danneved,"
235,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,He bade them saddle his courser grey:
236,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“O I will ride to Borrebye,"
237,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And a visit to my mother pay.”
238,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
239,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"O clinking were his spurs so keen,"
240,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And swiftly sped his horse along;
241,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,At Lundy Kirk in Skaaney land
242,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,He stopped to hear the matin song.
243,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
244,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"O first he heard the matin song,"
245,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,To hear nine masses stopped he then;
246,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And now it lists young Danneved
247,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,To mount upon his steed again.
248,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
249,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Out spake Oluf, the aged and good,"
250,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,He was I ween the parish priest:
251,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“I beg of thee, little Danneved,"
252,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,To be this day my honoured guest.”
253,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
254,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“This day I’ll break with no man bread,"
255,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Nor drink a drop of rosy wine,"
256,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Until I come to Borrebye,"
257,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And hold discourse with mother mine.”
258,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
259,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“Now hear me, dearest Danneved,"
260,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Give o’er, I beg, thy purpose straight;"
261,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,So many of thy enemies
262,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Before the town in ambush wait.”
263,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
264,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“O first I trust in my faulchion good,"
265,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And then I trust in my courser tall,"
266,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And next to them in my merry swains,"
267,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,But in my own self most of all.”
268,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
269,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“’Tis well to trust in thy faulchion good,"
270,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"’Tis well to trust in thy courser tall,"
271,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"But do not trust in thy merry swains,"
272,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,For they’ll deceive thee first of all.”
273,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
274,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"It was little Danneved,"
275,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Abroad before the town he came;
276,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And there met him his enemies,"
277,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Thrice nine in number were the same.
278,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
279,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"So numerous were these enemies,"
280,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"For him that did in ambush lie,"
281,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"All Danneved’s swains they took their leave,"
282,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And from their lord did basely fly.
283,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
284,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"All his merry men took their leave,"
285,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And from their master basely flew,"
286,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Except the young Swayne Trost alone,"
287,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,He with his lord took on anew.
288,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
289,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“O I, my Lord, your clothes have worn,"
290,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And ridden have I, my Lord, your steed,"
291,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And I will stand by you to-day,"
292,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Nor leave you in your greatest need.
293,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
294,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“O I have taken your silver and gold,"
295,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And I have eaten of your bread,"
296,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And I’ll not budge from you to-day,"
297,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Although my life-blood I should shed.”
298,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
299,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"So they their backs together placed,"
300,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Master and man, in the forest green;"
301,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And in the early morning tide
302,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,They of the foemen slew fifteen.
303,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
304,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Then they their backs together placed,"
305,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Where thick and high the bushes were;
306,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"They twain alone full thirty slew,"
307,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Acquiring honour ever fair.
308,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
309,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"It was the young Danneved,"
310,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,To his side his trusty faulchion tied;
311,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And now they both so joyously
312,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Home to his mother’s castle ride.
313,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
314,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"It was the young Danneved,"
315,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Came riding to the Castellaye;
316,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,It was then his mother dear
317,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Came out to meet him, blythe and gay."
318,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
319,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“Be welcome, little Danneved,"
320,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Be welcome to this house of mine;
321,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,What doth it please thee now to drink?
322,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"O, say, shall it be mead or wine?”"
323,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
324,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“O, I will ne’er break bread with you,"
325,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Or drink a drop of mead or wine,"
326,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,’Till thou hast given the young Swayne Trost
327,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Fair Ellen, only sister mine.”"
328,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
329,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“And do thou hear, my dearest son,"
330,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Hear what I now declare to thee;
331,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"As God shall help me in my need,"
332,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Brothers of Ellen both ye be.”
333,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
334,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“Now do thou hear, my mother dear,"
335,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,Thou’st not to me the truth declar’d;
336,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Where didst thou bear the young Swayne Trost,"
337,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,That of his birth I never heard?”
338,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
339,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“O he was but a little child,"
340,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,When him from out the land I sent;
341,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"And, hearing it said that he was dead,"
342,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,To none I did my loss lament.”
343,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
344,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Then up spoke little Danneved,"
345,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,He was the son of a knight so high:
346,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“Now I have such a brother found,"
347,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,I never more will grieve or sigh.
348,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
349,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"“God’s blessing upon thee, young Swayne Trost,"
350,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,To thee my troth I now will give;
351,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"I’ll ne’er deceive thee, young Swayne Trost,"
352,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,As long as I on earth shall live.”
353,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,
354,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,"Little Danneved and young Swayne Trost,"
355,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,In sables and mard themselves array;
356,LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.,And both of them took so joyously
