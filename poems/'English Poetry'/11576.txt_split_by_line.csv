32,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
33,INTRODUCTION,
34,INTRODUCTION,"The earliest poem in this volume bears the date 1794, when Lamb was"
35,INTRODUCTION,"nineteen, the latest 1834, the year of his death; so that it covers an"
36,INTRODUCTION,"even longer period of his life than Vol. I.--the ""Miscellaneous Prose."""
37,INTRODUCTION,The chronological order which was strictly observed in that volume has
38,INTRODUCTION,been only partly observed in the following pages--since it seemed better
39,INTRODUCTION,to keep the plays together and to make a separate section of Lamb's
40,INTRODUCTION,"epigrams. These, therefore, will be found to be outside the general"
41,INTRODUCTION,scheme. Such of Lamb's later poems as he did not himself collect in
42,INTRODUCTION,volume form will also be found to be out of their chronological
43,INTRODUCTION,"position, partly because it has seemed to me best to give prominence to"
44,INTRODUCTION,"those verses which Lamb himself reprinted, and partly because there is"
45,INTRODUCTION,often no indication of the year in which the poem was written.
46,INTRODUCTION,
47,INTRODUCTION,Another difficulty has been the frequency with which Lamb reprinted some
48,INTRODUCTION,of his earlier poetry. The text of many of his earliest and best poems
49,INTRODUCTION,"was not fixed until 1818, twenty years or so after their composition. It"
50,INTRODUCTION,had to be decided whether to print these poems in their true order as
51,INTRODUCTION,"they were first published--in Coleridge's _Poems on Various Subjects_,"
52,INTRODUCTION,"1796; in Charles Lloyd's _ems on the Death of Priscilla Farmer_, 1796;"
53,INTRODUCTION,"in Coleridge's _Poems_, second edition, 1797; in _Blank Verse_ by"
54,INTRODUCTION,"Charles Lloyd and Charles Lamb, 1798; and in John Woodvil, 1802--with"
55,INTRODUCTION,all their early readings; or whether to disregard chronological
56,INTRODUCTION,"sequence, and wait until the time of the _Works_--1818--had come, and"
57,INTRODUCTION,"print them all together then. I decided, in the interests of their"
58,INTRODUCTION,"biographical value, to print them in the order as they first appeared,"
59,INTRODUCTION,particularly as Crabb Robinson tells us that Lamb once said of the
60,INTRODUCTION,"arrangement of a poet's works: ""There is only one good order--and that"
61,INTRODUCTION,is the order in which they were written--that is a history of the poet's
62,INTRODUCTION,"mind."" It then had to be decided whether to print them in their first"
63,INTRODUCTION,"shape, which, unless I repeated them later, would mean the relegation of"
64,INTRODUCTION,"Lamb's final text to the Notes, or to print them, at the expense of a"
65,INTRODUCTION,"slight infringement upon the chronological scheme, in their final 1818"
66,INTRODUCTION,"state, and relegate all earlier readings to the Notes. After much"
67,INTRODUCTION,deliberation I decided that to print them in their final 1818 state was
68,INTRODUCTION,"best, and this therefore I did in the large edition of 1903, to which"
69,INTRODUCTION,"the student is referred for all variorum readings, fuller notes and many"
70,INTRODUCTION,"illustrations, and have repeated here. In order, however, that the"
71,INTRODUCTION,"scheme of Lamb's 1818 edition of his _Works_ might be preserved, I have"
72,INTRODUCTION,indicated in the text the position in the _Works_ occupied by all the
73,INTRODUCTION,poems that in the present volume have been printed earlier.
74,INTRODUCTION,
75,INTRODUCTION,"The chronological order, in so far as it has been followed, emphasises"
76,INTRODUCTION,the dividing line between Lamb's poetry and his verse. As he grew older
77,INTRODUCTION,"his poetry, for the most part, passed into his prose. His best and"
78,INTRODUCTION,"truest poems, with few exceptions, belong to the years before, say,"
79,INTRODUCTION,"1805, when he was thirty. After this, following a long interval of"
80,INTRODUCTION,"silence, came the brief satirical outburst of 1812, in _The Examiner_,"
81,INTRODUCTION,"and the longer one, in 1820, in _The Champion_; then, after another"
82,INTRODUCTION,"interval, during which he was busy as Elia, came the period of album"
83,INTRODUCTION,"verses, which lasted to the end. The impulse to write personal prose,"
84,INTRODUCTION,"which was quickened in Lamb by the _London Magazine_ in 1820, seems to"
85,INTRODUCTION,have taken the place of his old ambition to be a poet. In his later and
86,INTRODUCTION,"more mechanical period there were, however, occasional inspirations, as"
87,INTRODUCTION,"when he wrote the sonnet on ""Work,"" in 1819; on ""Leisure,"" in 1821; the"
88,INTRODUCTION,"lines in his own Album, in 1827, and, pre-eminently, the poem ""On an"
89,INTRODUCTION,"Infant Dying as Soon as Born,"" in 1827."
90,INTRODUCTION,
91,INTRODUCTION,"This volume contains, with the exception of the verse for children,"
92,INTRODUCTION,"which will be found in Vol. III. of this edition, all the accessible"
93,INTRODUCTION,poetical work of Charles and Mary Lamb that is known to exist and
94,INTRODUCTION,several poems not to be found in the large edition. There are probably
95,INTRODUCTION,still many copies of album verses which have not yet seen the light. In
96,INTRODUCTION,"the _London Magazine_, April, 1824, is a story entitled ""The Bride of"
97,INTRODUCTION,"Modern Italy,"" which has for motto the following couplet:--"
98,INTRODUCTION,
99,INTRODUCTION,My heart is fixt:
100,INTRODUCTION,This is the sixt.--_Elia_.
101,INTRODUCTION,
102,INTRODUCTION,but the rest of what seems to be a pleasant catalogue is missing. In a
103,INTRODUCTION,"letter to Coleridge, December 2, 1796, Lamb refers to a poem which has"
104,INTRODUCTION,"apparently perished, beginning, ""Laugh, all that weep."" I have left in"
105,INTRODUCTION,"the correspondence the rhyming letters to Ayrton and Dibdin, and an"
106,INTRODUCTION,"epigram on ""Coelebs in Search of a Wife."" I have placed the dedication"
107,INTRODUCTION,"to Coleridge at the beginning of this volume, although it belongs"
108,INTRODUCTION,properly only to those poems that are reprinted from the _Works_ of
109,INTRODUCTION,"1818, the prose of which Lamb offered to Martin Burney. But it is too"
110,INTRODUCTION,"fine to be put among the Notes, and it may easily, by a pardonable"
111,INTRODUCTION,"stretch, be made to refer to the whole body of Lamb's poetical and"
112,INTRODUCTION,"dramatic work, although _Album Verses_, 1830, was dedicated separately"
113,INTRODUCTION,to Edward Moxon.
114,INTRODUCTION,
115,INTRODUCTION,In Mr. Bedford's design for the cover of this edition certain Elian
116,INTRODUCTION,symbolism will be found. The upper coat of arms is that of Christ's
117,INTRODUCTION,"Hospital, where Lamb was at school; the lower is that of the Inner"
118,INTRODUCTION,"Temple, where he was born and spent many years. The figures at the bells"
119,INTRODUCTION,are those which once stood out from the fa√ßade of St. Dunstan's Church
120,INTRODUCTION,"in Fleet Street, and are now in Lord Londesborough's garden in Regent's"
121,INTRODUCTION,Park. Lamb shed tears when they were removed. The tricksy sprite and the
122,INTRODUCTION,candles (brought by Betty) need no explanatory words of mine.

7687,SANDFORD,"On chiding hence these graceless serving-men,"
7688,SANDFORD,Who cannot break their fast at morning meals
7689,SANDFORD,Without debauch and mis-timed riotings.
7690,SANDFORD,This house hath been a scene of nothing else
7691,SANDFORD,"But atheist riot and profane excess,"
7692,SANDFORD,Since my old master quitted all his rights here.
7693,SANDFORD,
7694,MARGARET,MARGARET

7707,MARGARET,"All things seem chang'd, I think. I had a friend,"
7708,MARGARET,"(I can't but weep to think him alter'd too,)"
7709,MARGARET,These things are best forgotten; but I knew
7710,MARGARET,"A man, a young man, young, and full of honor,"
7711,MARGARET,"That would have pick'd a quarrel for a straw,"
7712,MARGARET,"And fought it out to the extremity,"
7713,MARGARET,"E'en with the dearest friend he had alive,"
7714,MARGARET,"On but a bare surmise, a possibility,"
7715,MARGARET,That Margaret had suffer'd an affront.

7728,MARGARET,"And sue to him for slow redress, who was"
7729,MARGARET,Himself a suitor late to Margaret.
7730,MARGARET,I am somewhat proud: and Woodvil taught me pride.
7731,MARGARET,"I was his favourite once, his playfellow in infancy,"
7732,MARGARET,And joyful mistress of his youth.
7733,MARGARET,None once so pleasant in his eyes as Margaret.
7734,MARGARET,"His conscience, his religion, Margaret was,"
7735,MARGARET,"His dear heart's confessor, a heart within that heart,"
7736,MARGARET,And all dear things summ'd up in her alone.
7737,MARGARET,As Margaret smil'd or frown'd John liv'd or died:
7738,MARGARET,"His dress, speech, gesture, studies, friendships, all"
7739,MARGARET,Being fashion'd to her liking.
7740,MARGARET,"His flatteries taught me first this self-esteem,"
7741,MARGARET,"His flatteries and caresses, while he loved."
7742,MARGARET,"The world esteem'd her happy, who had won"

7760,MARGARET,Can never stoop so low to supplicate
7761,MARGARET,"A man, her equal, to redress those wrongs,"
7762,MARGARET,Which he was bound first to prevent;
7763,MARGARET,"But which his own neglects have sanction'd rather,"
7764,MARGARET,"Both sanction'd and provok'd: a mark'd neglect,"
7765,MARGARET,"And strangeness fast'ning bitter on his love,"
7766,MARGARET,His love which long has been upon the wane.

7782,MARGARET,MARGARET
7783,MARGARET,"I have thought on every possible event,"
7784,MARGARET,"The dangers and discouragements you speak of,"
7785,MARGARET,"Even till my woman's heart hath ceas'd to fear them,"
7786,MARGARET,And cowardice grows enamour'd of rare accidents.

7804,MARGARET,"Of their concealment, place, and manner of life,"
7805,MARGARET,And the merry hours they spend in the green haunts
7806,MARGARET,"Of Sherwood, nigh which place they have ta'en a house"
7807,MARGARET,"In the town of Nottingham, and pass for foreigners,"
7808,MARGARET,Wearing the dress of Frenchmen.--

8057,LOVEL,"The common-wealthsman, and state machinist,"
8058,LOVEL,"The cropt fanatic, and fifth-monarchy-man,"
8059,LOVEL,Who heareth of these visionaries now?
8060,LOVEL,"They and their dreams have ended. Fools do sing,"
8061,LOVEL,"Where good men yield God thanks; but politic spirits,"
8062,LOVEL,"Who live by observation, note these changes"
8063,LOVEL,"Of the popular mind, and thereby serve their ends."
8064,LOVEL,"Then why not I? What's Charles to me, or Oliver,"
8065,LOVEL,But as my own advancement hangs on one of them?
8066,LOVEL,"I to myself am chief.--I know,"
8067,LOVEL,"Some shallow mouths cry out, that I am smit"
8068,LOVEL,"With the gauds and shew of state, the point of place,"
8069,LOVEL,"And trick of precedence, the ducks, and nods,"
8070,LOVEL,Which weak minds pay to rank. 'Tis not to sit
8071,LOVEL,"In place of worship at the royal masques,"
8072,LOVEL,"Their pastimes, plays, and Whitehall banquetings,"
8073,LOVEL,"For none of these,"
8074,LOVEL,"Nor yet to be seen whispering with some great one,"
8075,LOVEL,Do I affect the favours of the court.
8076,LOVEL,"I would be great, for greatness hath great _power_,"
8077,LOVEL,And that's the fruit I reach at.--
8078,LOVEL,"Great spirits ask great play-room. Who could sit,"
8079,LOVEL,"With these prophetic swellings in my breast,"
8080,LOVEL,"That prick and goad me on, and never cease,"
8081,LOVEL,To the fortunes something tells me I was born to?
8082,LOVEL,"Who, with such monitors within to stir him,"
8083,LOVEL,"Would sit him down, with lazy arms across,"
8084,LOVEL,"A unit, a thing without a name in the state,"
8085,LOVEL,"A something to be govern'd, not to govern,"
8086,LOVEL,"A fishing, hawking, hunting, country gentleman?"

8095,SIR WALTER WOODVIL. SIMON WOODVIL.,SIR WALTER WOODVIL. SIMON WOODVIL.
8096,SIR WALTER WOODVIL. SIMON WOODVIL.,(_Disguised as Frenchmen_.)
8097,SIR WALTER WOODVIL. SIMON WOODVIL.,
8098,SIR WALTER WOODVIL. SIMON WOODVIL.,
8099,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8100,SIR WALTER,"How fares my boy, Simon, my youngest born,"
8101,SIR WALTER,"My hope, my pride, young Woodvil, speak to me?"
8102,SIR WALTER,Some grief untold weighs heavy at thy heart:
8103,SIR WALTER,I know it by thy alter'd cheer of late.
8104,SIR WALTER,"Thinkest, thy brother plays thy father false?"
8105,SIR WALTER,"It is a mad and thriftless prodigal,"
8106,SIR WALTER,Grown proud upon the favours of the court;
8107,SIR WALTER,"Court manners, and court fashions, he affects,"
8108,SIR WALTER,"And in the heat and uncheck'd blood of youth,"
8109,SIR WALTER,"Harbours a company of riotous men,"
8110,SIR WALTER,"All hot, and young, court-seekers, like himself,"
8111,SIR WALTER,Most skilful to devour a patrimony;
8112,SIR WALTER,"And these have eat into my old estates,"
8113,SIR WALTER,And these have drain'd thy father's cellars dry;
8114,SIR WALTER,"But these so common faults of youth not named,"
8115,SIR WALTER,"(Things which themselves outgrow, left to themselves,)"
8116,SIR WALTER,I know no quality that stains his honor.
8117,SIR WALTER,"My life upon his faith and noble mind,"
8118,SIR WALTER,Son John could never play thy father false.
8119,SIR WALTER,
8120,SIMON,SIMON
8121,SIMON,"I never thought but nobly of my brother,"
8122,SIMON,Touching his honor and fidelity.
8123,SIMON,"Still I could wish him charier of his person,"
8124,SIMON,"And of his time more frugal, than to spend"
8125,SIMON,"In riotous living, graceless society,"
8126,SIMON,"And mirth unpalatable, hours better employ'd"
8127,SIMON,(With those persuasive graces nature lent him)
8128,SIMON,In fervent pleadings for a father's life.
8129,SIMON,
8130,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8131,SIR WALTER,"I would not owe my life to a jealous court,"
8132,SIR WALTER,"Whose shallow policy I know it is,"
8133,SIR WALTER,"On some reluctant acts of prudent mercy,"
8134,SIR WALTER,"(Not voluntary, but extorted by the times,"
8135,SIR WALTER,"In the first tremblings of new-fixed power,"
8136,SIR WALTER,"And recollection smarting from old wounds,)"
8137,SIR WALTER,On these to build a spurious popularity.
8138,SIR WALTER,"Unknowing what free grace or mercy mean,"
8139,SIR WALTER,"They fear to punish, therefore do they pardon."
8140,SIR WALTER,"For this cause have I oft forbid my son,"
8141,SIR WALTER,"By letters, overtures, open solicitings,"
8142,SIR WALTER,"Or closet-tamperings, by gold or fee,"
8143,SIR WALTER,To beg or bargain with the court for my life.
8144,SIR WALTER,
8145,SIMON,SIMON
8146,SIMON,"And John has ta'en you, father, at your word,"
8147,SIMON,True to the letter of his paternal charge.
8148,SIMON,
8149,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8150,SIR WALTER,"Well, my good cause, and my good conscience, boy,"
8151,SIR WALTER,"Shall be for sons to me, if John prove false."
8152,SIR WALTER,"Men die but once, and the opportunity"
8153,SIR WALTER,Of a noble death is not an every-day fortune:
8154,SIR WALTER,It is a gift which noble spirits pray for.
8155,SIR WALTER,
8156,SIMON,SIMON
8157,SIMON,I would not wrong my brother by surmise;
8158,SIMON,"I know him generous, full of gentle qualities,"
8159,SIMON,"Incapable of base compliances,"
8160,SIMON,"No prodigal in his nature, but affecting"
8161,SIMON,This shew of bravery for ambitious ends.
8162,SIMON,"He drinks, for 'tis the humour of the court,"
8163,SIMON,"And drink may one day wrest the secret from him,"
8164,SIMON,And pluck you from your hiding place in the sequel.
8165,SIMON,
8166,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8167,SIR WALTER,"Fair death shall be my doom, and foul life his."
8168,SIR WALTER,"Till when, we'll live as free in this green forest"
8169,SIR WALTER,"As yonder deer, who roam unfearing treason:"
8170,SIR WALTER,"Who seem the Aborigines of this place,"
8171,SIR WALTER,Or Sherwood theirs by tenure.
8172,SIR WALTER,
8173,SIMON,SIMON
8174,SIMON,"'Tis said, that Robert Earl of Huntingdon,"
8175,SIMON,"Men call'd him Robin Hood, an outlaw bold,"
8176,SIMON,"With a merry crew of hunters here did haunt,"
8177,SIMON,Not sparing the king's venison. May one believe
8178,SIMON,The antique tale?
8179,SIMON,
8180,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8181,SIR WALTER,
8182,SIR WALTER,"There is much likelihood,"
8183,SIR WALTER,"Such bandits did in England erst abound,"
8184,SIR WALTER,When polity was young. I have read of the pranks
8185,SIR WALTER,"Of that mad archer, and of the tax he levied"
8186,SIR WALTER,"On travellers, whatever their degree,"
8187,SIR WALTER,"Baron, or knight, whoever pass'd these woods,"
8188,SIR WALTER,"Layman, or priest, not sparing the bishop's mitre"
8189,SIR WALTER,"For spiritual regards; nay, once, 'tis said,"
8190,SIR WALTER,He robb'd the king himself.
8191,SIR WALTER,
8192,SIMON,SIMON
8193,SIMON,A perilous man. (_Smiling_.)
8194,SIMON,
8195,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8196,SIR WALTER,"How quietly we live here,"
8197,SIR WALTER,"Unread in the world's business,"
8198,SIR WALTER,And take no note of all its slippery changes.
8199,SIR WALTER,"'Twere best we make a world among ourselves,"
8200,SIR WALTER,"A little world,"
8201,SIR WALTER,Without the ills and falsehoods of the greater:
8202,SIR WALTER,"We two being all the inhabitants of ours,"
8203,SIR WALTER,And kings and subjects both in one.
8204,SIR WALTER,
8205,SIMON,SIMON
8206,SIMON,"Only the dangerous errors, fond conceits,"
8207,SIMON,"Which make the business of that greater world,"
8208,SIMON,Must have no place in ours:
8209,SIMON,"As, namely, riches, honors, birth, place, courtesy,"
8210,SIMON,"Good fame and bad, rumours and popular noises,"
8211,SIMON,"Books, creeds, opinions, prejudices national,"
8212,SIMON,"Humours particular,"
8213,SIMON,"Soul-killing lies, and truths that work small good,"
8214,SIMON,"Feuds, factions, enmities, relationships,"
8215,SIMON,"Loves, hatreds, sympathies, antipathies,"
8216,SIMON,And all the intricate stuff quarrels are made of.
8217,SIMON,
8218,SIMON,(_Margaret enters in boy's apparel_.)
8219,SIMON,
8220,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8221,SIR WALTER,What pretty boy have we here?
8222,SIR WALTER,
8223,MARGARET,MARGARET
8224,MARGARET,"_Bon jour, messieurs_. Ye have handsome English faces,"
8225,MARGARET,"I should have ta'en you else for other two,"
8226,MARGARET,I came to seek in the forest.
8227,MARGARET,
8228,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8229,SIR WALTER,Who are they?
8230,SIR WALTER,
8231,MARGARET,MARGARET
8232,MARGARET,"A gallant brace of Frenchmen, curled monsieurs,"
8233,MARGARET,"That, men say, haunt these woods, affecting privacy,"
8234,MARGARET,More than the manner of their countrymen.
8235,MARGARET,
8236,SIMON,SIMON
8237,SIMON,We have here a wonder.
8238,SIMON,The face is Margaret's face.
8239,SIMON,
8240,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8241,SIR WALTER,"The face is Margaret's, but the dress the same"
8242,SIR WALTER,My Stephen sometimes wore.
8243,SIR WALTER,
8244,SIR WALTER,(_To Margaret_)
8245,SIR WALTER,
8246,SIR WALTER,Suppose us them; whom do men say we are?
8247,SIR WALTER,Or know you what you seek?
8248,SIR WALTER,
8249,MARGARET,MARGARET
8250,MARGARET,"A worthy pair of exiles,"
8251,MARGARET,"Two whom the politics of state revenge,"
8252,MARGARET,"In final issue of long civil broils,"
8253,MARGARET,"Have houseless driven from your native France,"
8254,MARGARET,"To wander idle in these English woods,"
8255,MARGARET,Where now ye live; most part
8256,MARGARET,"Thinking on home, and all the joys of France,"
8257,MARGARET,Where grows the purple vine.
8258,MARGARET,
8259,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8260,SIR WALTER,"These woods, young stranger,"
8261,SIR WALTER,"And grassy pastures, which the slim deer loves,"
8262,SIR WALTER,"Are they less beauteous than the land of France,"
8263,SIR WALTER,Where grows the purple vine?
8264,SIR WALTER,
8265,MARGARET,MARGARET
8266,MARGARET,I cannot tell.
8267,MARGARET,To an indifferent eye both shew alike.
8268,MARGARET,"'Tis not the scene,"
8269,MARGARET,"But all familiar objects in the scene,"
8270,MARGARET,"Which now ye miss, that constitute a difference."
8271,MARGARET,"Ye had a country, exiles, ye have none now;"
8272,MARGARET,"Friends had ye, and much wealth, ye now have nothing;"
8273,MARGARET,"Our manners, laws, our customs, all are foreign to you,"
8274,MARGARET,"I know ye loathe them, cannot learn them readily;"
8275,MARGARET,"And there is reason, exiles, ye should love"
8276,MARGARET,"Our English earth less than your land of France,"
8277,MARGARET,"Where grows the purple vine; where all delights grow,"
8278,MARGARET,Old custom has made pleasant.
8279,MARGARET,
8280,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8281,SIR WALTER,"You, that are read"
8282,SIR WALTER,"So deeply in our story, what are you?"
8283,SIR WALTER,
8284,MARGARET,MARGARET
8285,MARGARET,"A bare adventurer; in brief a woman,"
8286,MARGARET,"That put strange garments on, and came thus far"
8287,MARGARET,To seek an ancient friend:
8288,MARGARET,"And having spent her stock of idle words,"
8289,MARGARET,"And feeling some tears coming,"
8290,MARGARET,"Hastes now to clasp Sir Walter Woodvil's knees,"
8291,MARGARET,"And beg a boon for Margaret, his poor ward.  (_Kneeling_.)"
8292,MARGARET,
8293,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8294,SIR WALTER,"Not at my feet, Margaret, not at my feet."
8295,SIR WALTER,
8296,MARGARET,MARGARET
8297,MARGARET,"Yes, till her suit is answer'd."
8298,MARGARET,
8299,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8300,SIR WALTER,Name it.
8301,SIR WALTER,
8302,MARGARET,MARGARET
8303,MARGARET,"A little boon, and yet so great a grace,"
8304,MARGARET,She fears to ask it.
8305,MARGARET,
8306,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8307,SIR WALTER,"Some riddle, Margaret?"
8308,SIR WALTER,
8309,MARGARET,MARGARET
8310,MARGARET,"No riddle, but a plain request."
8311,MARGARET,
8312,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8313,SIR WALTER,Name it.
8314,SIR WALTER,
8315,MARGARET,MARGARET
8316,MARGARET,"Free liberty of Sherwood,"
8317,MARGARET,And leave to take her lot with you in the forest.
8318,MARGARET,
8319,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8320,SIR WALTER,"A scant petition, Margaret, but take it,"
8321,SIR WALTER,Seal'd with an old man's tears.--
8322,SIR WALTER,"Rise, daughter of Sir Rowland."
8323,SIR WALTER,
8324,SIR WALTER,(_Addresses them both._)
8325,SIR WALTER,
8326,SIR WALTER,"O you most worthy,"
8327,SIR WALTER,"You constant followers of a man proscribed,"
8328,SIR WALTER,Following poor misery in the throat of danger;
8329,SIR WALTER,"Fast servitors to craz'd and penniless poverty,"
8330,SIR WALTER,Serving poor poverty without hope of gain;
8331,SIR WALTER,Kind children of a sire unfortunate;
8332,SIR WALTER,"Green clinging tendrils round a trunk decay'd,"
8333,SIR WALTER,Which needs must bring on you timeless decay;
8334,SIR WALTER,Fair living forms to a dead carcase join'd;--
8335,SIR WALTER,What shall I say?
8336,SIR WALTER,"Better the dead were gather'd to the dead,"
8337,SIR WALTER,Than death and life in disproportion meet.--
8338,SIR WALTER,"Go, seek your fortunes, children.--"
8339,SIR WALTER,
8340,SIMON,SIMON
8341,SIMON,"Why, whither should we go?"
8342,SIMON,
8343,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8344,SIR WALTER,"_You_ to the Court, where now your brother John"
8345,SIR WALTER,Commits a rape on Fortune.
8346,SIR WALTER,
8347,SIMON,SIMON
8348,SIMON,Luck to John!
8349,SIMON,"A light-heel'd strumpet, when the sport is done."
8350,SIMON,
8351,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8352,SIR WALTER,"_You_ to the sweet society of your equals,"
8353,SIR WALTER,Where the world's fashion smiles on youth and beauty.
8354,SIR WALTER,
8355,MARGARET,MARGARET
8356,MARGARET,"Where young men's flatteries cozen young maids' beauty,"
8357,MARGARET,"There pride oft gets the vantage hand of duty,"
8358,MARGARET,There sweet humility withers.
8359,MARGARET,
8360,SIMON,SIMON
8361,SIMON,"Mistress Margaret,"
8362,SIMON,"How fared my brother John, when you left Devon?"
8363,SIMON,
8364,MARGARET,MARGARET
8365,MARGARET,"John was well, Sir."
8366,MARGARET,
8367,SIMON,SIMON
8368,SIMON,"'Tis now nine months almost,"
8369,SIMON,Since I saw home. What new friends has John made?
8370,SIMON,Or keeps he his first love?--I did suspect
8371,SIMON,"Some foul disloyalty. Now do I know,"
8372,SIMON,"John has prov'd false to her, for Margaret weeps."
8373,SIMON,It is a scurvy brother.
8374,SIMON,
8375,SIR WALTER,SIR WALTER
8376,SIR WALTER,Fie upon it.
8377,SIR WALTER,"All men are false, I think. The date of love"
8378,SIR WALTER,"Is out, expired, its stories all grown stale,"
8379,SIR WALTER,"O'erpast, forgotten, like an antique tale"
8380,SIR WALTER,Of Hero and Leander.
8381,SIR WALTER,
8382,SIR WALTER,
8383,SIMON,SIMON
8384,SIMON,I have known some men that are too general-contemplative for the narrow
8385,SIMON,passion. I am in some sort a _general_ lover.
8386,SIMON,
8387,MARGARET,MARGARET
8388,MARGARET,"In the name of the boy God, who plays at hood-man-blind with the Muses,"
8389,MARGARET,and cares not whom he catches: what is it _you_ love?
8390,MARGARET,
8391,MARGARET,
8392,SIMON,SIMON
8393,SIMON,"Simply, all things that live,"
8394,SIMON,"From the crook'd worm to man's imperial form,"
8395,SIMON,"And God-resembling likeness. The poor fly,"
8396,SIMON,"That makes short holyday in the sun beam,"
8397,SIMON,And dies by some child's hand. The feeble bird
8398,SIMON,"With little wings, yet greatly venturous"
8399,SIMON,"In the upper sky. The fish in th' other element,"
8400,SIMON,That knows no touch of eloquence. What else?
8401,SIMON,"Yon tall and elegant stag,"
8402,SIMON,Who paints a dancing shadow of his horns
8403,SIMON,"In the water, where he drinks."
8404,SIMON,
8405,MARGARET,MARGARET
8406,MARGARET,"I myself love all these things, yet so as with a difference:--"
8407,MARGARET,"for example, some animals better than others, some men"
8408,MARGARET,"rather than other men; the nightingale before the cuckoo, the"
8409,MARGARET,swift and graceful palfrey before the slow and asinine mule.
8410,MARGARET,Your humour goes to confound all qualities.
8411,MARGARET,What sports do you use in the forest?--
8412,MARGARET,
8413,SIMON,SIMON
8414,SIMON,"Not many; some few, as thus:--"
8415,SIMON,"To see the sun to bed, and to arise,"
8416,SIMON,"Like some hot amourist with glowing eyes,"
8417,SIMON,"Bursting the lazy bands of sleep that bound him,"
8418,SIMON,With all his fires and travelling glories round him.
8419,SIMON,"Sometimes the moon on soft night clouds to rest,"
8420,SIMON,"Like beauty nestling in a young man's breast,"
8421,SIMON,"And all the winking stars, her handmaids, keep"
8422,SIMON,"Admiring silence, while those lovers sleep."
8423,SIMON,"Sometimes outstretcht, in very idleness,"
8424,SIMON,"Nought doing, saying little, thinking less,"
8425,SIMON,"To view the leaves, thin dancers upon air,"
8426,SIMON,"Go eddying round; and small birds, how they fare,"
8427,SIMON,"When mother Autumn fills their beaks with corn,"
8428,SIMON,Filch'd from the careless Amalthea's horn;
8429,SIMON,And how the woods berries and worms provide
8430,SIMON,"Without their pains, when earth has nought beside"
8431,SIMON,To answer their small wants.
8432,SIMON,"To view the graceful deer come tripping by,"
8433,SIMON,"Then stop, and gaze, then turn, they know not why,"
8434,SIMON,Like bashful younkers in society.
8435,SIMON,"To mark the structure of a plant or tree,"
8436,SIMON,"And all fair things of earth, how fair they be."
8437,SIMON,
8438,SIMON,MARGARET (_smiling_)
8439,SIMON,"And, afterwards them paint in simile."

8443,SIR WALTER,"Please you, we have some poor viands within."

8449,SIR WALTER,"Under the shade of a thick-spreading tree,"
8450,SIR WALTER,"Upon the grass, no better carpeting,"
8451,SIR WALTER,"We'll eat our noon-tide meal; and, dinner done,"
8452,SIR WALTER,"One of us shall repair to Nottingham,"
8453,SIR WALTER,"To seek some safe night-lodging in the town,"
8454,SIR WALTER,"Where you may sleep, while here with us you dwell,"
8455,SIR WALTER,"By day, in the forest, expecting better times,"
8456,SIR WALTER,"And gentler habitations, noble Margaret."

8463,MARGARET,"I've studied love-lays in the English tongue,"

8465,MARGARET,"Which now I must unlearn. Henceforth,"
8466,MARGARET,"Sweet mother-tongue, old English speech, adieu;"

9183,SANDFORD,not before noted in him) and appeared to be touched with a sense as of
9184,SANDFORD,some unkindness; but the cause of their sad separation and divorce

9424,JOHN,
9425,MARGARET,MARGARET
9426,MARGARET,To give you in your stead a better self!
9427,MARGARET,"Such as you were, when these eyes first beheld"
9428,MARGARET,"You mounted on your sprightly steed, White Margery,"
9429,MARGARET,"Sir Rowland my father's gift,"
9430,MARGARET,And all my maidens gave my heart for lost.
9431,MARGARET,"I was a young thing then, being newly come"
9432,MARGARET,"Home from my convent education, where"
9433,MARGARET,Seven years I had wasted in the bosom of France:
9434,MARGARET,"Returning home true protestant, you call'd me"
9435,MARGARET,Your little heretic nun. How timid-bashful
9436,MARGARET,"Did John salute his love, being newly seen."
9437,MARGARET,"Sir Rowland term'd it a rare modesty,"
9438,MARGARET,And prais'd it in a youth.

9455,JOHN,"Saint Mary Ottery, my native village"
9456,JOHN,In the sweet shire of Devon.
9457,JOHN,Those are the bells.
9458,JOHN,
9459,MARGARET,MARGARET
9460,MARGARET,"Wilt go to church, John?"
9461,MARGARET,
9462,JOHN,JOHN
9463,JOHN,I have been there already.
9464,JOHN,
9465,MARGARET,MARGARET
9466,MARGARET,How canst say thou hast been there already? The bells are only now
9467,MARGARET,"ringing for morning service, and hast thou been at church already?"
9468,MARGARET,
9469,JOHN,JOHN
9470,JOHN,"I left my bed betimes, I could not sleep,"
9471,JOHN,"And when I rose, I look'd (as my custom is)"
9472,JOHN,"From my chamber window, where I can see the sun rise;"
9473,JOHN,And the first object I discern'd
9474,JOHN,Was the glistering spire of St. Mary Ottery.
9475,JOHN,
9476,MARGARET,MARGARET
9477,MARGARET,"Well, John."
9478,MARGARET,
9479,JOHN,JOHN
9480,JOHN,Then I remember'd 'twas the sabbath-day.
9481,JOHN,"Immediately a wish arose in my mind,"
9482,JOHN,To go to church and pray with Christian people.
9483,JOHN,
9484,JOHN,"And then I check'd myself, and said to myself,"
9485,JOHN,"""Thou hast been a heathen, John, these two years past,"
9486,JOHN,"(Not having been at church in all that time,)"
9487,JOHN,"And is it fit, that now for the first time"
9488,JOHN,Thou should'st offend the eyes of Christian people
9489,JOHN,With a murderer's presence in the house of prayer?
9490,JOHN,"Thou would'st but discompose their pious thoughts,"
9491,JOHN,"And do thyself no good: for how could'st thou pray,"
9492,JOHN,"With unwash'd hands, and lips unus'd to the offices?"""
9493,JOHN,And then I at my own presumption smiled;
9494,JOHN,"And then I wept that I should smile at all,"
9495,JOHN,Having such cause of grief! I wept outright;
9496,JOHN,"Tears like a river flooded all my face,"
9497,JOHN,"And I began to pray, and found I could pray;"
9498,JOHN,And still I yearn'd to say my prayers in the church.
9499,JOHN,"""Doubtless (said I) one might find comfort in it."""
9500,JOHN,"So stealing down the stairs, like one that fear'd detection,"
9501,JOHN,Or was about to act unlawful business
9502,JOHN,"At that dead time of dawn,"
9503,JOHN,"I flew to the church, and found the doors wide open,"
9504,JOHN,"(Whether by negligence I knew not,"
9505,JOHN,"Or some peculiar grace to me vouchsaf'd,"
9506,JOHN,For all things felt like mystery).

9512,JOHN,"So entering in, not without fear,"
9513,JOHN,"I past into the family pew,"
9514,JOHN,"And covering up my eyes for shame,"
9515,JOHN,"And deep perception of unworthiness,"
9516,JOHN,"Upon the little hassock knelt me down,"
9517,JOHN,"Where I so oft had kneel'd,"
9518,JOHN,A docile infant by Sir Walter's side;
9519,JOHN,"And, thinking so, I wept a second flood"
9520,JOHN,More poignant than the first;
9521,JOHN,But afterwards was greatly comforted.
9522,JOHN,"It seem'd, the guilt of blood was passing from me"

9554,SERVANT,"One summer night Sir Francis, as it chanced,"
9555,SERVANT,Was pacing to and fro in the avenue
9556,SERVANT,"That westward fronts our house,"
9557,SERVANT,"Among those aged oaks, said to have been planted"
9558,SERVANT,Three hundred years ago
9559,SERVANT,By a neighb'ring prior of the Fairford name.
9560,SERVANT,"Being o'er-task'd in thought, he heeded not"
9561,SERVANT,"The importunate suit of one who stood by the gate,"
9562,SERVANT,And begged an alms.
9563,SERVANT,Some say he shoved her rudely from the gate
9564,SERVANT,With angry chiding; but I can never think
9565,SERVANT,(Our master's nature hath a sweetness in it)
9566,SERVANT,"That he could use a woman, an old woman,"
9567,SERVANT,With such discourtesy: but he refused her--
9568,SERVANT,And better had he met a lion in his path
9569,SERVANT,Than that old woman that night;
9570,SERVANT,"For she was one who practised the black arts,"
9571,SERVANT,"And served the devil, being since burnt for witchcraft."
9572,SERVANT,"She looked at him as one that meant to blast him,"
9573,SERVANT,"And with a frightful noise,"
9574,SERVANT,"('Twas partly like a woman's voice,"
9575,SERVANT,"And partly like the hissing of a snake,)"
9576,SERVANT,She nothing said but this:--
9577,SERVANT,(Sir Francis told the words)
9578,SERVANT,
9579,SERVANT,"_A mischief, mischief, mischief,"
9580,SERVANT,"And a nine-times-killing curse,"
9581,SERVANT,"By day and by night, to the caitiff wight,"
9582,SERVANT,"Who shakes the poor like snakes from his door,"
9583,SERVANT,And shuts up the womb of his purse_.
9584,SERVANT,
9585,SERVANT,And still she cried
9586,SERVANT,
9587,SERVANT,"_A mischief,"
9588,SERVANT,And a nine-fold-withering curse:
9589,SERVANT,"For that shall come to thee that will undo thee,"
9590,SERVANT,Both all that thou fearest and worse_.
9591,SERVANT,
9592,SERVANT,"So saying, she departed,"
9593,SERVANT,"Leaving Sir Francis like a man, beneath"

9601,SERVANT,"Nothing immediate, but some two months after"
9602,SERVANT,"Young Philip Fairford suddenly fell sick,"
9603,SERVANT,"And none could tell what ailed him; for he lay,"
9604,SERVANT,"And pined, and pined, till all his hair fell off,"
9605,SERVANT,"And he, that was full-fleshed, became as thin"
9606,SERVANT,As a two-months' babe that has been starved in the nursing.
9607,SERVANT,And sure I think
9608,SERVANT,He bore his death-wound like a little child;
9609,SERVANT,With such rare sweetness of dumb melancholy
9610,SERVANT,"He strove to clothe his agony in smiles,"
9611,SERVANT,"Which he would force up in his poor pale cheeks,"
9612,SERVANT,Like ill-timed guests that had no proper dwelling there;
9613,SERVANT,"And, when they asked him his complaint, he laid"
9614,SERVANT,"His hand upon his heart to shew the place,"
9615,SERVANT,"Where Susan came to him a-nights, he said,"
9616,SERVANT,And prick'd him with a pin.--
9617,SERVANT,And thereupon Sir Francis called to mind
9618,SERVANT,The beggar-witch that stood by the gateway
9619,SERVANT,And begged an alms.

10283,LANDLORD,"Deeds must have names to them, so must leases and wills. But I"
10284,LANDLORD,wouldn't--no I wouldn't--it is a pretty box too--prettily dovetailed--I
10285,LANDLORD,"admire the fashion of it much. But I'd cut my fingers off, before I'd do"
10286,LANDLORD,"such a dirty--what have I to do--curse the keys, how they rattle--rattle"
10287,LANDLORD,in one's pockets--the keys and the halfpence (_takes out a bunch and
10288,LANDLORD,plays with them_). I wounder if any of these would fit; one might just
10289,LANDLORD,"try them, but I wouldn't lift up the lid if they did. Oh no, what should"
10290,LANDLORD,I be the richer for knowing? (_All this time he tries the keys one by
10291,LANDLORD,one_.) What's his name to me? a thousand names begin with an H. I hate
10292,LANDLORD,"people that are always prying, poking and prying into things,--thrusting"
10293,LANDLORD,their finger into one place--a mighty little hole this--and their keys
10294,LANDLORD,into another. Oh Lord! little rusty fits it! but what is that to me? I
10295,LANDLORD,wouldn't go to--no no--but it is odd little rusty should just happen.

10310,LANDLORD,"Sir, don't kill me, and I will confess the whole truth. This box"

10312,LANDLORD,"happened to have my keys out, and so--little rusty happened to fit--"
10313,LANDLORD,
10314,MR. H.,MR. H.
10315,MR. H.,So little rusty happened to fit!--and would not a rope fit that rogue's
10316,MR. H.,"neck? I see the papers have not been moved: all is safe, but it was as"

10319,MR. H.,"Come, Landlord, as I think you"

10335,MR. H.,
10336,LANDLORD,LANDLORD
10337,LANDLORD,"A natural thirst after knowledge you may call it, Sir. When a boy I was"
10338,LANDLORD,"never easy, but when I was thrusting up the lids of some of my"
10339,LANDLORD,"school-fellows' boxes,--not to steal any thing, upon my honour,"
10340,LANDLORD,"Sir,--only to see what was in them; have had pens stuck in my eyes for"
10341,LANDLORD,peeping through key-holes after knowledge; could never see a cold pie
10342,LANDLORD,"with the legs dangling out at top, but my fingers were for lifting up"
10343,LANDLORD,"the crust,--just to try if it were pigeon or partridge,--for no other"
10344,LANDLORD,reason in the world. Surely I think my passion for nuts was owing to the
10345,LANDLORD,"pleasure of cracking the shell to get at something concealed, more than"
10346,LANDLORD,"to any delight I took in eating the kernel. In short, Sir, this appetite"
10347,LANDLORD,has grown with my growth.
10348,LANDLORD,
10349,MR. H.,MR. H.
10350,MR. H.,You will certainly be hanged some day for peeping into some bureau or

10354,LANDLORD,"That is my fear, Sir. The thumps and kicks I have had for peering into"

10356,LANDLORD,blankets I have been made to dance in for searching parish-registers for
10357,LANDLORD,"old ladies' ages,--just for curiosity! Once I was dragged through a"
10358,LANDLORD,"horse-pond, only for peeping into a closet that had glass doors to it,"
10359,LANDLORD,"while my Lady Bluegarters was undressing,--just for curiosity!"

10361,MR. H.,MR. H.

11648,CUTLET,"A weeping Londoner I am,"
11649,CUTLET,A washer-woman was my dam;
11650,CUTLET,"She bred me up in a cock-loft,"
11651,CUTLET,And fed my mind with sorrows soft:
11652,CUTLET,
11653,CUTLET,For when she wrung with elbows stout
11654,CUTLET,"From linen wet the water out,--"
11655,CUTLET,"The drops so like to tears did drip,"
11656,CUTLET,They gave my infant nerves the hyp.

11658,CUTLET,Scarce three clean muckingers a week

11675,CUTLET,"Without a pang more keen at heart,"
11676,CUTLET,Than he felt at his outward part.
11677,CUTLET,
11678,CUTLET,"And when the poor thing clattered off,"
11679,CUTLET,"To all the unfeeling mob a scoff,"
11680,CUTLET,"Thought I, ""What that dumb creature feels,"
11681,CUTLET,"With half the parish at his heels!"""

11693,CUTLET,"But when they're dead I sell their meat,"
11694,CUTLET,On shambles kept both clean and neat;
11695,CUTLET,"Sweet-breads also I guard full well,"

11698,CUTLET,"Envy, with breath sharp as my steel,"
11699,CUTLET,Has ne'er yet blown upon my veal;

11772,PENDULOUS,PENDULOUS
11773,PENDULOUS,"A great deal farther, I assure you, Mr. Davenport. I am ashamed to say"
11774,PENDULOUS,"how far it went. You must know, that in the first shock and surprise of"
11775,PENDULOUS,"the accusation, shame--you know I was always susceptible--shame put me"
11776,PENDULOUS,"upon disguising my _name_, that, at all events, it might bring no"

11791,PENDULOUS,PENDULOUS
11792,PENDULOUS,This served the purpose of a temporary concealment well enough; but when

12207,MISS FLYN,MISS FLYN
12208,MISS FLYN,I understand not this language. I was prepared to give my Pendulous a

12214,MISS FLYN,"holiest vows, as ours have been. This untimely repulse to my affections"
12215,MISS FLYN,"may awaken scruples in me, which hitherto, in tenderness to you, I have"

12271,MARIAN,"without disclosing my present situation, to tell him, that my next"
12272,MARIAN,step--with or without the concurrence of Mr. Davenport--shall be to
12273,MARIAN,"throw myself at his feet, and beg to be forgiven. I dare not see him"
12274,MARIAN,till you have explored the way for me. I am convinced I was tricked into
12275,MARIAN,this elopement.
12276,MARIAN,

12290,MARIAN,
12291,MISS FLYN,MISS FLYN
12292,MISS FLYN,You mistake. The refinement is entirely on the part of my lover. He
12293,MISS FLYN,"thinks me not nice enough. I am obliged to feign a little reluctance,"
12294,MISS FLYN,"that he may not take quite a distaste to me. Will you believe it, that"
12295,MISS FLYN,"he turns my very constancy into a reproach, and declares, that a woman"
12296,MISS FLYN,"must be devoid of all delicacy, that, after a thing of that sort, could"

12315,MISS FLYN,"None, unless I were to try the experiment, by placing myself in the"
12316,MISS FLYN,"hands of justice for a little while, how far an equality in misfortune"
12317,MISS FLYN,might breed a sympathy in sentiment. Our reputations would be both upon
12318,MISS FLYN,"a level, then, you know. What think you of a little innocent"

12320,MISS FLYN,

12797,SELBY,"Of smooth and even wedlock, now to touch"
12798,SELBY,With any strain of harshness on a string
12799,SELBY,Hath yielded me such music. 'Twas the quality
12800,SELBY,"Of a too grateful nature in my Katherine,"
12801,SELBY,"That to the lame performance of some vows,"
12802,SELBY,"And common courtesies of man to wife,"
12803,SELBY,"Attributing too much, hath sometimes seem'd"
12804,SELBY,"To esteem in favours, what in that blest union"
12805,SELBY,"Are but reciprocal and trivial dues,"
12806,SELBY,As fairly yours as mine: 'twas this I thought
12807,SELBY,Gently to reprehend.
12808,SELBY,
12809,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
12810,KATHERINE,In friendship's barter
12811,KATHERINE,"The riches we exchange should hold some level,"
12812,KATHERINE,And corresponding worth. Jewels for toys
12813,KATHERINE,"Demand some thanks thrown in. You took me, sir,"
12814,KATHERINE,"To that blest haven of my peace, your bosom,"
12815,KATHERINE,An orphan founder'd in the world's black storm.
12816,KATHERINE,"Poor, you have made me rich; from lonely maiden,"
12817,KATHERINE,Your cherish'd and your full-accompanied wife.
12818,KATHERINE,
12819,SELBY,SELBY
12820,SELBY,"But to divert the subject: Kate too fond,"
12821,SELBY,I would not wrest your meanings; else that word
12822,SELBY,"Accompanied, and full-accompanied too,"
12823,SELBY,"Might raise a doubt in some men, that their wives"
12824,SELBY,Haply did think their company too long;
12825,SELBY,"And over-company, we know by proof,"
12826,SELBY,Is worse than no attendance.
12827,SELBY,
12828,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
12829,KATHERINE,"I must guess,"
12830,KATHERINE,You speak this of the Widow--
12831,KATHERINE,
12832,SELBY,SELBY
12833,SELBY,'Twas a bolt
12834,SELBY,"At random shot; but if it hit, believe me,"
12835,SELBY,I am most sorry to have wounded you
12836,SELBY,Through a friend's side. I know not how we have swerved
12837,SELBY,From our first talk. I was to caution you
12838,SELBY,Against this fault of a too grateful nature:
12839,SELBY,"Which, for some girlish obligations past,"
12840,SELBY,"In that relenting season of the heart,"
12841,SELBY,When slightest favours pass for benefits
12842,SELBY,"Of endless binding, would entail upon you"
12843,SELBY,An iron slavery of obsequious duty
12844,SELBY,To the proud will of an imperious woman.
12845,SELBY,
12846,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
12847,KATHERINE,The favours are not slight to her I owe.
12848,KATHERINE,
12849,SELBY,SELBY
12850,SELBY,"Slight or not slight, the tribute she exacts"
12851,SELBY,Cancels all dues--_[A voice within.]_
12852,SELBY,even now I hear her call you
12853,SELBY,"In such a tone, as lordliest mistresses"
12854,SELBY,"Expect a slave's attendance. Prithee, Kate,"
12855,SELBY,Let her expect a brace of minutes or so.
12856,SELBY,"Say, you are busy. Use her by degrees"
12857,SELBY,To some less hard exactions.
12858,SELBY,
12859,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
12860,KATHERINE,"I conjure you,"
12861,KATHERINE,Detain me not. I will return--
12862,KATHERINE,
12863,SELBY,SELBY
12864,SELBY,Sweet wife
12865,SELBY,Use thy own pleasure--_[Exit Katherine.]_
12866,SELBY,but it troubles me.
12867,SELBY,"A visit of three days, as was pretended,"
12868,SELBY,"Spun to ten tedious weeks, and no hint given"
12869,SELBY,When she will go! I would this buxom Widow
12870,SELBY,Were a thought handsomer! I'd fairly try
12871,SELBY,My Katherine's constancy; make desperate love
12872,SELBY,"In seeming earnest; and raise up such broils,"
12873,SELBY,"That she, not I, should be the first to warn"
12874,SELBY,The insidious guest depart.
12875,SELBY,
12876,SELBY,_Re-enter Katherine._
12877,SELBY,
12878,SELBY,So soon return'd!
12879,SELBY,What was our Widow's will?
12880,SELBY,
12881,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
12882,KATHERINE,"A trifle, Sir."
12883,KATHERINE,
12884,SELBY,SELBY
12885,SELBY,"Some toilet service-to adjust her head,"
12886,SELBY,Or help to stick a pin in the right place--
12887,SELBY,
12888,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
12889,KATHERINE,Indeed 'twas none of these.
12890,KATHERINE,
12891,SELBY,SELBY
12892,SELBY,or new vamp up
12893,SELBY,The tarnish'd cloak she came in. I have seen her
12894,SELBY,"Demand such service from thee, as her maid,"
12895,SELBY,"Twice told to do it, would blush angry-red,"
12896,SELBY,And pack her few clothes up. Poor fool! fond slave!
12897,SELBY,And yet my dearest Kate!--This day at least
12898,SELBY,"(It is our wedding-day) we spend in freedom,"
12899,SELBY,"And will forget our Widow.--Philip, our coach--"
12900,SELBY,"Why weeps my wife? You know, I promised you"
12901,SELBY,An airing o'er the pleasant Hampshire downs
12902,SELBY,"To the blest cottage on the green hill side,"
12903,SELBY,"Where first I told my love. I wonder much,"
12904,SELBY,If the crimson parlour hath exchanged its hue
12905,SELBY,"For colours not so welcome. Faded though it be,"
12906,SELBY,It will not shew less lovely than the tinge
12907,SELBY,"Of this faint red, contending with the pale,"
12908,SELBY,Where once the full-flush'd health gave to this cheek
12909,SELBY,"An apt resemblance to the fruit's warm side,"
12910,SELBY,That bears my Katherine's name.--
12911,SELBY,
12912,SELBY,"Our carriage, Philip."
12913,SELBY,
12914,SELBY,_Enter a Servant_.

12918,SERVANT,SERVANT
12919,SERVANT,"May it please you,"
12920,SERVANT,The coachman has driven out with Mrs. Frampton.

12923,SELBY,He had no orders--
12924,SELBY,
12925,SERVANT,SERVANT
12926,SERVANT,"None, Sir, that I know of,"
12927,SERVANT,"But from the lady, who expects some letter"
12928,SERVANT,At the next Post Town.

12930,SELBY,SELBY
12931,SELBY,"Go, Robin."

12938,KATHERINE,"I came to tell you so, but fear'd your anger--"
12939,KATHERINE,
12940,SELBY,SELBY
12941,SELBY,"It was ill done though of this Mistress Frampton,"
12942,SELBY,This forward Widow. But a ride's poor loss
12943,SELBY,"Imports not much. In to your chamber, love,"
12944,SELBY,"Where you with music may beguile the hour,"
12945,SELBY,"While I am tossing over dusty tomes,"
12946,SELBY,Till our most reasonable friend returns.
12947,SELBY,
12948,SELBY,
12949,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
12950,KATHERINE,I am all obedience.      [_Exit Katherine_]
12951,KATHERINE,
12952,SELBY,SELBY
12953,SELBY,"Too obedient, Kate,"
12954,SELBY,And to too many masters. I can hardly
12955,SELBY,On such a day as this refrain to speak
12956,SELBY,"My sense of this injurious friend, this pest,"
12957,SELBY,"This household evil, this close-clinging fiend,"
12958,SELBY,In rough terms to my wife. 'Death! my own servants
12959,SELBY,Controll'd above me! orders countermanded!'
12960,SELBY,What next? _[Servant enters and announces the Sister]
12961,SELBY,
12962,SELBY,_Enter Lucy._
12963,SELBY,

12965,SELBY,This day's return. 'Twas well done.
12966,SELBY,
12967,LUCY,LUCY
12968,LUCY,You seem ruffled.
12969,LUCY,In years gone by this day was used to be
12970,LUCY,The smoothest of the year. Your honey turn'd
12971,LUCY,So soon to gall?
12972,LUCY,
12973,SELBY,SELBY
12974,SELBY,"Gall'd am I, and with cause,"
12975,SELBY,"And rid to death, yet cannot get a riddance,"
12976,SELBY,"Nay, scarce a ride, by this proud Widow's leave."
12977,SELBY,
12978,LUCY,LUCY
12979,LUCY,Something you wrote me of a Mistress Frampton.
12980,LUCY,
12981,SELBY,SELBY
12982,SELBY,"She came at first a meek admitted guest,"
12983,SELBY,Pretending a short stay; her whole deportment
12984,SELBY,"Seem'd as of one obliged. A slender trunk,"
12985,SELBY,"The wardrobe of her scant and ancient clothing,"
12986,SELBY,"Bespoke no more. But in a few days her dress,"
12987,SELBY,"Her looks, were proudly changed. And now she flaunts it"
12988,SELBY,In jewels stolen or borrow'd from my wife;
12989,SELBY,"Who owes her some strange service, of what nature"
12990,SELBY,I must be kept in ignorance. Katherine's meek
12991,SELBY,"And gentle spirit cowers beneath her eye,"
12992,SELBY,As spell-bound by some witch.
12993,SELBY,
12994,LUCY,LUCY
12995,LUCY,Some mystery hangs on it.
12996,LUCY,How bears she in her carriage towards yourself?
12997,LUCY,
12998,SELBY,SELBY
12999,SELBY,"As one who fears, and yet not greatly cares"
13000,SELBY,"For my displeasure. Sometimes I have thought,"
13001,SELBY,"A secret glance would tell me she could love,"
13002,SELBY,If I but gave encouragement. Before me
13003,SELBY,She keeps some moderation; but is never
13004,SELBY,"Closeted with my wife, but in the end"
13005,SELBY,I find my Katherine in briny tears.
13006,SELBY,"From the small chamber, where she first was lodged,"
13007,SELBY,The gradual fiend by specious wriggling arts
13008,SELBY,Has now ensconced herself in the best part
13009,SELBY,Of this large mansion; calls the left wing her own;
13010,SELBY,"Commands my servants, equipage.--I hear"
13011,SELBY,Her hated tread. What makes she back so soon?
13012,SELBY,
13013,SELBY,_Enter Mrs. Frampton._
13014,SELBY,
13015,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13016,MRS. FRAMPTON,"O, I am jolter'd, bruised, and shook to death,"
13017,MRS. FRAMPTON,With your vile Wiltshire roads. The villain Philip
13018,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Chose, on my conscience, the perversest tracks,"
13019,MRS. FRAMPTON,"And stoniest hard lanes in all the county,"
13020,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Till I was fain get out, and so walk back,"
13021,MRS. FRAMPTON,My errand unperform'd at Andover.
13022,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13023,LUCY,LUCY
13024,LUCY,And I shall love the knave for ever after.

13028,MRS. FRAMPTON,A friend with you!
13029,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13030,SELBY,SELBY
13031,SELBY,"My eldest sister, Lucy,"
13032,SELBY,Come to congratulate this returning morn.--

13034,SELBY,
13035,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13036,MRS. FRAMPTON,Pray
13037,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Be seated. For your brother's sake, you are welcome."
13038,MRS. FRAMPTON,I had thought this day to have spent in homely fashion
13039,MRS. FRAMPTON,"With the good couple, to whose hospitality"
13040,MRS. FRAMPTON,I stand so far indebted. But your coming
13041,MRS. FRAMPTON,Makes it a feast.

13050,SELBY,
13051,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13052,MRS. FRAMPTON,I love to be at home with loving friends.
13053,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To stand on ceremony with obligations,"
13054,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Is to restrain the obliger. That old coach, though,"
13055,MRS. FRAMPTON,Of yours jumbles one strangely.
13056,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13057,SELBY,SELBY
13058,SELBY,I shall order

13065,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13066,MRS. FRAMPTON,I must go trim myself; this humbled garb
13067,MRS. FRAMPTON,Would shame a wedding feast. I have your leave
13068,MRS. FRAMPTON,For a short absence?--and your Katherine--
13069,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13070,SELBY,SELBY
13071,SELBY,You'll find her in her closet--

13078,SELBY,
13079,LUCY,LUCY
13080,LUCY,"Even so well,"
13081,LUCY,"That if this Widow were my guest, not yours,"
13082,LUCY,"She should have coach enough, and scope to ride."
13083,LUCY,My merry groom should in a trice convey her
13084,LUCY,"To Sarum Plain, and set her down at Stonehenge,"
13085,LUCY,To pick her path through those antiques at leisure;
13086,LUCY,She should take sample of our Wiltshire flints.
13087,LUCY,"O, be not lightly jealous! nor surmise,"
13088,LUCY,That to a wanton bold-faced thing like this
13089,LUCY,Your modest shrinking Katherine could impart
13090,LUCY,"Secrets of any worth, especially"
13091,LUCY,"Secrets that touch'd your peace. If there be aught,"
13092,LUCY,"My life upon't, 'tis but some girlish story"
13093,LUCY,Of a First Love; which even the boldest wife
13094,LUCY,"Might modestly deny to a husband's ear,"
13095,LUCY,Much more your timid and too sensitive Katherine.
13096,LUCY,
13097,SELBY,SELBY
13098,SELBY,I think it is no more; and will dismiss
13099,SELBY,"My further fears, if ever I have had such."

13102,LUCY,"Shall we go walk? I'd see your gardens, brother;"

13229,KATHERINE,What you are pleased to speak!--How my heart sinks here!

13231,KATHERINE,
13232,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13233,MRS. FRAMPTON,"My chamber to myself, my separate maid,"
13234,MRS. FRAMPTON,"My coach, and so forth.--Not that needle, simple one,"
13235,MRS. FRAMPTON,With the great staring eye fit for a Cyclops!
13236,MRS. FRAMPTON,Mine own are not so blinded with their griefs
13237,MRS. FRAMPTON,But I could make a shift to thread a smaller.
13238,MRS. FRAMPTON,"A cable or a camel might go through this,"
13239,MRS. FRAMPTON,And never strain for the passage.
13240,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13241,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13242,KATHERINE,
13243,KATHERINE,I will fit you.--
13244,KATHERINE,Intolerable tyranny!       [_Aside._]
13245,KATHERINE,
13246,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13247,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Quick, quick;"
13248,MRS. FRAMPTON,"You were not once so slack.--As I was saying,"
13249,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Not a young thing among ye, but observed me"
13250,MRS. FRAMPTON,Above the mistress. Who but I was sought to
13251,MRS. FRAMPTON,"In all your dangers, all your little difficulties,"
13252,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Your girlish scrapes? I was the scape-goat still,"
13253,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To fetch you off; kept all your secrets, some,"
13254,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Perhaps, since then--"
13255,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13256,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13257,KATHERINE,"No more of that, for mercy,"
13258,KATHERINE,"If you'd not have me, sinking at your feet,"
13259,KATHERINE,Cleave the cold earth for comfort.   [_Kneels._]
13260,KATHERINE,
13261,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13262,MRS. FRAMPTON,This to me?
13263,MRS. FRAMPTON,This posture to your friend had better suited
13264,MRS. FRAMPTON,The orphan Katherine in her humble school-days
13265,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To the _then_ rich heiress, than the wife of Selby,"
13266,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Of wealthy Mr. Selby,"
13267,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To the poor widow Frampton, sunk as she is."
13268,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Come, come,"
13269,MRS. FRAMPTON,"'Twas something, or 'twas nothing, that I said;"
13270,MRS. FRAMPTON,"I did not mean to fright you, sweetest bed-fellow!"
13271,MRS. FRAMPTON,"You once were so, but Selby now engrosses you."
13272,MRS. FRAMPTON,I'll make him give you up a night or so;
13273,MRS. FRAMPTON,"In faith I will: that we may lie, and talk"
13274,MRS. FRAMPTON,Old tricks of school-days over.
13275,MRS. FRAMPTON,

13277,KATHERINE,"Hear me, madam--"
13278,KATHERINE,
13279,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13280,MRS. FRAMPTON,Not by that name. Your friend--
13281,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13282,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13283,KATHERINE,"My truest friend,"
13284,KATHERINE,And saviour of my honour!
13285,KATHERINE,
13286,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13287,MRS. FRAMPTON,This sounds better;
13288,MRS. FRAMPTON,You still shall find me such.
13289,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13290,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13291,KATHERINE,That you have graced
13292,KATHERINE,"Our poor house with your presence hitherto,"
13293,KATHERINE,"Has been my greatest comfort, the sole solace"
13294,KATHERINE,Of my forlorn and hardly guess'd estate.
13295,KATHERINE,You have been pleased
13296,KATHERINE,"To accept some trivial hospitalities,"
13297,KATHERINE,In part of payment of a long arrear
13298,KATHERINE,"I owe to you, no less than for my life."
13299,KATHERINE,
13300,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13301,MRS. FRAMPTON,You speak my services too large.
13302,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13303,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13304,KATHERINE,"Nay, less;"
13305,KATHERINE,For what an abject thing were life to me
13306,KATHERINE,Without your silence on my dreadful secret!
13307,KATHERINE,And I would wish the league we have renew'd
13308,KATHERINE,Might be perpetual--
13309,KATHERINE,
13310,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13311,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Have a care, fine madam! [_Aside._]"
13312,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13313,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13314,KATHERINE,That one house still might hold us. But my husband
13315,KATHERINE,Has shown himself of late--
13316,KATHERINE,
13317,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13318,MRS. FRAMPTON,How Mistress Selby?
13319,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13320,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13321,KATHERINE,"Not, not impatient. You misconstrue him."
13322,KATHERINE,"He honours, and he loves, nay, he must love"
13323,KATHERINE,The friend of his wife's youth. But there are moods
13324,KATHERINE,In which--
13325,KATHERINE,
13326,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13327,MRS. FRAMPTON,"I understand you;--in which husbands,"
13328,MRS. FRAMPTON,"And wives that love, may wish to be alone,"
13329,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To nurse the tender fits of new-born dalliance,"
13330,MRS. FRAMPTON,After a five years' wedlock.
13331,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13332,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13333,KATHERINE,Was that well
13334,KATHERINE,Or charitably put? do these pale cheeks
13335,KATHERINE,Proclaim a wanton blood? this wasting form
13336,KATHERINE,Seem a fit theatre for Levity
13337,KATHERINE,"To play his love-tricks on; and act such follies,"
13338,KATHERINE,As even in Affection's first bland Moon
13339,KATHERINE,Have less of grace than pardon in best wedlocks?
13340,KATHERINE,"I was about to say, that there are times,"
13341,KATHERINE,When the most frank and sociable man
13342,KATHERINE,"May surfeit on most loved society,"
13343,KATHERINE,Preferring loneness rather--
13344,KATHERINE,
13345,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13346,MRS. FRAMPTON,To my company--
13347,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13348,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13349,KATHERINE,"Ay, your's, or mine, or any one's. Nay, take"
13350,KATHERINE,Not this unto yourself. Even in the newness
13351,KATHERINE,Of our first married loves 'twas sometimes so.
13352,KATHERINE,"For solitude, I have heard my Selby say,"
13353,KATHERINE,Is to the mind as rest to the corporal functions;
13354,KATHERINE,"And he would call it oft, the _day's soft sleep._"
13355,KATHERINE,
13356,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13357,MRS. FRAMPTON,"What is your drift? and whereto tends this speech,"
13358,MRS. FRAMPTON,Rhetorically labour'd?
13359,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13360,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13361,KATHERINE,That you would
13362,KATHERINE,"Abstain but from our house a month, a week;"
13363,KATHERINE,I make request but for a single day.
13364,KATHERINE,
13365,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13366,MRS. FRAMPTON,"A month, a week, a day! A single hour"
13367,MRS. FRAMPTON,"In every week, and month, and the long year,"
13368,MRS. FRAMPTON,"And all the years to come! My footing here,"
13369,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Slipt once, recovers never. From the state"
13370,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Of gilded roofs, attendance, luxuries,"
13371,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Parks, gardens, sauntering walks, or wholesome rides,"
13372,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To the bare cottage on the withering moor,"
13373,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Where I myself am servant to myself,"
13374,MRS. FRAMPTON,Or only waited on by blackest thoughts--
13375,MRS. FRAMPTON,"I sink, if this be so. No; here I sit."
13376,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13377,KATHERINE,KATHERINE
13378,KATHERINE,Then I am lost for ever!

13391,SELBY,The sounds have died away. What am I changed to?
13392,SELBY,"What do I here, list'ning like to an abject,"
13393,SELBY,"Or heartless wittol, that must hear no good,"
13394,SELBY,"If he hear aught? ""This shall to the ear of your husband."""
13395,SELBY,"It was the Widow's word. I guess'd some mystery,"
13396,SELBY,And the solution with a vengeance comes.
13397,SELBY,"What can my wife have left untold to me,"
13398,SELBY,That must be told by proxy? I begin
13399,SELBY,To call in doubt the course of her life past
13400,SELBY,"Under my very eyes. She hath not been good,"
13401,SELBY,"Not virtuous, not discreet; she hath not outrun"
13402,SELBY,My wishes still with prompt and meek observance.
13403,SELBY,"Perhaps she is not fair, sweet-voiced; her eyes"
13404,SELBY,"Not like the dove's; all this as well may be,"
13405,SELBY,As that she should entreasure up a secret
13406,SELBY,"In the peculiar closet of her breast,"
13407,SELBY,And grudge it to my ear. It is my right
13408,SELBY,"To claim the halves in any truth she owns,"
13409,SELBY,As much as in the babe I have by her;
13410,SELBY,"Upon whose face henceforth I fear to look,"
13411,SELBY,Lest I should fancy in its innocent brow
13412,SELBY,Some strange shame written.

13416,SELBY,"Sister, an anxious word with you."

13418,SELBY,"Held talk with her encroaching friend, I heard"
13419,SELBY,"(Not of set purpose heark'ning, but by chance)"
13420,SELBY,"A voice of chiding, answer'd by a tone"
13421,SELBY,"Of replication, such as the meek dove"
13422,SELBY,"Makes, when the kite has clutch'd her. The high Widow"
13423,SELBY,Was loud and stormy. I distinctly heard
13424,SELBY,"One threat pronounced--""Your husband shall know all."""
13425,SELBY,"I am no listener, sister; and I hold"
13426,SELBY,"A secret, got by such unmanly shift,"
13427,SELBY,"The pitiful'st of thefts; but what mine ear,"
13428,SELBY,"I not intending it, receives perforce,"
13429,SELBY,I count my lawful prize. Some subtle meaning
13430,SELBY,"Lurks in this fiend's behaviour; which, by force,"

13439,SELBY,I have tried
13440,SELBY,"All gentler means; thrown out low hints, which, though"
13441,SELBY,"Merely suggestions still, have never fail'd"
13442,SELBY,"To blanch her cheek with fears. Roughlier to insist,"
13443,SELBY,"Would be to kill, where I but meant to heal."
13444,SELBY,
13445,LUCY,LUCY
13446,LUCY,Your own description gave that Widow out
13447,LUCY,"As one not much precise, nor over coy,"
13448,LUCY,And nice to listen to a suit of love.
13449,LUCY,"What if you feign'd a courtship, putting on,"
13450,LUCY,"(To work the secret from her easy faith,)"
13451,LUCY,"For honest ends, a most dishonest seeming?"
13452,LUCY,
13453,SELBY,SELBY
13454,SELBY,"I see your drift, and partly meet your counsel."
13455,SELBY,"But must it not in me appear prodigious,"
13456,SELBY,"To say the least, unnatural, and suspicious,"
13457,SELBY,"To move hot love, where I have shewn cool scorn,"

13464,LUCY,The slight-built fortress of a casual hate.

13490,MRS. FRAMPTON,"What mean his alter'd tones? These looks to me,"

13492,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Is the wind changed? I'll veer about with it,"
13493,MRS. FRAMPTON,And meet him in all fashions.      [_Aside._]
13494,MRS. FRAMPTON,"All my leisure,"
13495,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Feebly bestow'd upon my kind friends here,"
13496,MRS. FRAMPTON,Would not express a tithe of the obligements
13497,MRS. FRAMPTON,I every hour incur.
13498,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13499,SELBY,SELBY
13500,SELBY,No more of that.--
13501,SELBY,"I know not why, my wife hath lost of late"
13502,SELBY,Much of her cheerful spirits.
13503,SELBY,
13504,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13505,MRS. FRAMPTON,It was my topic
13506,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To-day; and every day, and all day long,"
13507,MRS. FRAMPTON,"I still am chiding with her. ""Child,"" I said,"
13508,MRS. FRAMPTON,And said it pretty roundly--it may be
13509,MRS. FRAMPTON,"I was too peremptory--we elder school-fellows,"
13510,MRS. FRAMPTON,Presuming on the advantage of a year
13511,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Or two, which, in that tender time, seem'd much,"
13512,MRS. FRAMPTON,"In after years, much like to elder sisters,"
13513,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Are prone to keep the authoritative style,"

13520,MRS. FRAMPTON,"""Child,"" I was saying,"
13521,MRS. FRAMPTON,"""If some wives had obtained a lot like yours,"""
13522,MRS. FRAMPTON,"And then perhaps I sigh'd, ""they would not sit"

13525,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Their cheerful husbands in the face,"" perhaps"
13526,MRS. FRAMPTON,"I said, their Selby's, ""with proportion'd looks"

13535,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13536,SELBY,SELBY
13537,SELBY,"I do not know, but women have their fancies;"
13538,SELBY,"And underneath a cold indifference,"
13539,SELBY,"Or show of some distaste, husbands have mask'd"
13540,SELBY,"A growing fondness for a female friend,"
13541,SELBY,Which the wife's eye was sharp enough to see
13542,SELBY,Before the friend had wit to find it out.

13555,MRS. FRAMPTON,"What matter, sir?"
13556,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13557,SELBY,SELBY
13558,SELBY,This idle bond of wedlock;
13559,SELBY,"These sour-sweet briars, fetters of harsh silk;"

13573,SELBY,
13574,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON

13576,MRS. FRAMPTON,"As jestingly I'll put the supposition,"

13579,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13580,SELBY,SELBY
13581,SELBY,"I like your humour, and will meet your jest."
13582,SELBY,She should be one about my Katherine's age;

13584,SELBY,"One that would meet my mirth, sometimes outrun it;"

13591,SELBY,Took it not so to heart that I need dread
13592,SELBY,"To die myself, for fear a second time"

13594,SELBY,
13595,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13596,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Some widows, sir,"
13597,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Hearing you talk so wildly, would be apt"
13598,MRS. FRAMPTON,"To put strange misconstruction on your words,"
13599,MRS. FRAMPTON,"As aiming at a Turkish liberty,"
13600,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Where the free husband hath his several mates,"
13601,MRS. FRAMPTON,"His Penseroso, his Allegro wife,"

13607,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13608,MRS. FRAMPTON,"As one,"
13609,MRS. FRAMPTON,"In European customs bred, must judge. Had I"
13610,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Been born a native of the liberal East,"
13611,MRS. FRAMPTON,I might have thought as they do. Yet I knew
13612,MRS. FRAMPTON,"A married man that took a second wife,"
13613,MRS. FRAMPTON,"And (the man's circumstances duly weigh'd,"
13614,MRS. FRAMPTON,With all their bearings) the considerate world

13622,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Upon a Widow, who liked him again,"
13623,MRS. FRAMPTON,"But stood on terms of honourable love,"
13624,MRS. FRAMPTON,And scrupled wronging his most virtuous wife---
13625,MRS. FRAMPTON,"When to their ears a lucky rumour ran,"
13626,MRS. FRAMPTON,That this demure and saintly-seeming wife
13627,MRS. FRAMPTON,Had a first husband living; with the which
13628,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Being question'd, she but faintly could deny."
13629,MRS. FRAMPTON,"""A priest indeed there was; some words had passed,"
13630,MRS. FRAMPTON,But scarce amounting to a marriage rite.
13631,MRS. FRAMPTON,Her friend was absent; she supposed him dead;
13632,MRS. FRAMPTON,"And, seven years parted, both were free to chuse."""
13633,MRS. FRAMPTON,
13634,SELBY,SELBY
13635,SELBY,What did the indignant husband? Did he not
13636,SELBY,With violent handlings stigmatize the cheek

13641,MRS. FRAMPTON,He neither tore
13642,MRS. FRAMPTON,His wife's locks nor his own; but wisely weighing
13643,MRS. FRAMPTON,"His own offence with her's in equal poise,"
13644,MRS. FRAMPTON,"And woman's weakness 'gainst the strength of man,"
13645,MRS. FRAMPTON,Came to a calm and witty compromise.
13646,MRS. FRAMPTON,"He coolly took his gay-faced widow home,"
13647,MRS. FRAMPTON,Made her his second wife; and still the first
13648,MRS. FRAMPTON,Lost few or none of her prerogatives.
13649,MRS. FRAMPTON,The servants call'd her mistress still; she kept
13650,MRS. FRAMPTON,"The keys, and had the total ordering"
13651,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Of the house affairs; and, some slight toys excepted,"
13652,MRS. FRAMPTON,Was all a moderate wife would wish to be.

13662,MRS. FRAMPTON,"But his first wife's first name, her maiden one,"
13663,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Was--not unlike to that your Katherine bore,"

13668,SELBY,A dangerous meaning in your riddle lurks.
13669,SELBY,"One knot is yet unsolved; that told, this strange"

13675,MRS. FRAMPTON,MRS. FRAMPTON
13676,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Sir, your pardon--"
13677,MRS. FRAMPTON,The allegory fits your private ear.
13678,MRS. FRAMPTON,"Some half hour hence, in the garden's secret walk,"
13679,MRS. FRAMPTON,We shall have leisure. [_Exit._]

13685,LUCY,"From your poor Katherine's chamber, where she droops"
13686,LUCY,"In sad presageful thoughts, and sighs, and weeps,"
13687,LUCY,And seems to pray by turns. At times she looks
13688,LUCY,As she would pour her secret in my bosom---
13689,LUCY,"Then starts, as I have seen her, at the mention"
13690,LUCY,Of some immodest act. At her request
13691,LUCY,I left her on her knees.
13692,LUCY,
13693,SELBY,SELBY
13694,SELBY,The fittest posture;
13695,SELBY,For great has been her fault to Heaven and me.
13696,SELBY,"She married me, with a first husband living,"
13697,SELBY,"Or not known not to be so, which, in the judgment"
13698,SELBY,"Of any but indifferent honesty,"
13699,SELBY,"Must be esteem'd the same. The shallow Widow,"
13700,SELBY,"Caught by my art, under a riddling veil"
13701,SELBY,"Too thin to hide her meaning, hath confess'd all."
13702,SELBY,"Your coming in broke off the conference,"
13703,SELBY,"When she was ripe to tell the fatal _name_,"
13704,SELBY,That seals my wedded doom.
13705,SELBY,
13706,LUCY,LUCY
13707,LUCY,Was she so forward
13708,LUCY,To pour her hateful meanings in your ear
13709,LUCY,At the first hint?
13710,LUCY,
13711,LUCY,
13712,SELBY,SELBY
13713,SELBY,Her newly flatter'd hopes
13714,SELBY,Array'd themselves at first in forms of doubt;
13715,SELBY,And with a female caution she stood off
13716,SELBY,"Awhile, to read the meaning of my suit,"
13717,SELBY,"Which with such honest seeming I enforced,"
13718,SELBY,That her cold scruples soon gave way; and now
13719,SELBY,"She rests prepared, as mistress, or as wife,"
13720,SELBY,To seize the place of her betrayed friend--
13721,SELBY,"My much offending, but more suffering, Katherine."
13722,SELBY,
13723,LUCY,LUCY
13724,LUCY,Into what labyrinth of fearful shapes
13725,LUCY,My simple project has conducted you--
13726,LUCY,Were but my wit as skilful to invent
13727,LUCY,A clue to lead you forth!--I call to mind
13728,LUCY,"A letter, which your wife received from the Cape,"
13729,LUCY,"Soon after you were married, with some circumstances"
13730,LUCY,Of mystery too.
13731,LUCY,
13732,SELBY,SELBY
13733,SELBY,I well remember it.
13734,SELBY,That letter did confirm the truth (she said)
13735,SELBY,"Of a friend's death, which she had long fear'd true,"
13736,SELBY,But knew not for a fact. A youth of promise
13737,SELBY,She gave him out--a hot adventurous spirit--
13738,SELBY,"That had set sail in quest of golden dreams,"
13739,SELBY,And cities in the heart of Central Afric;
13740,SELBY,"But named no names, nor did I care to press"
13741,SELBY,"My question further, in the passionate grief"
13742,SELBY,She shew'd at the receipt. Might this be he?
13743,SELBY,
13744,LUCY,LUCY
13745,LUCY,"Tears were not all. When that first shower was past,"
13746,LUCY,"With clasped hands she raised her eyes to Heav'n,"
13747,LUCY,"As if in thankfulness for some escape,"
13748,LUCY,"Or strange deliverance, in the news implied,"
13749,LUCY,Which sweeten'd that sad news.
13750,LUCY,
13751,SELBY,SELBY
13752,SELBY,Something of that
13753,SELBY,I noted also--

13756,LUCY,LUCY
13757,LUCY,"In her closet once,"
13758,LUCY,"Seeking some other trifle, I espied"
13759,LUCY,"A ring, in mournful characters deciphering"
13760,LUCY,"The death of ""Robert Halford, aged two"
13761,LUCY,"And twenty."" Brother, I am not given"
13762,LUCY,"To the confident use of wagers, which I hold"
13763,LUCY,Unseemly in a woman's argument;
13764,LUCY,But I am strangely tempted now to risk
13765,LUCY,"A thousand pounds out of my patrimony,"
13766,LUCY,(And let my future husband look to it
13767,LUCY,"If it be lost,) that this immodest Widow"
13768,LUCY,Shall name the name that tallies with that ring.
13769,LUCY,
13770,SELBY,SELBY
13771,SELBY,"That wager lost, I should be rich indeed--"
13772,SELBY,"Rich in my rescued Kate--rich in my honour,"
13773,SELBY,"Which now was bankrupt. Sister, I accept"
13774,SELBY,"Your merry wager, with an aching heart"
13775,SELBY,For very fear of winning. 'Tis the hour
13776,SELBY,"That I should meet my Widow in the walk,"
13777,SELBY,The south side of the garden. On some pretence
13778,SELBY,"Lure forth my Wife that way, that she may witness"
13779,SELBY,"Our seeming courtship. Keep us still in sight,"
13780,SELBY,"Yourselves unseen; and by some sign I'll give,"
13781,SELBY,"(A finger held up, or a kerchief waved,)"
13782,SELBY,"You'll know your wager won--then break upon us,"
13783,SELBY,As if by chance.
13784,SELBY,
13785,LUCY,LUCY
13786,LUCY,I apprehend your meaning--
13787,LUCY,
13788,SELBY,SELBY

14358,NOTES,
14359,NOTES,"Some mystery attaches to the authorship of this sonnet. On December 1,"
14360,NOTES,"1794, Coleridge wrote to the editor of the _Morning Chronicle_ saying"
14361,NOTES,"that he proposed to send a series of sonnets (""as it is the fashion to"
14362,NOTES,"call them"") addressed to eminent contemporaries; and he enclosed one to"
14363,NOTES,"Mr. Erskine. The editor, with almost Chinese politeness, inserted"
14364,NOTES,"beneath the sonnet this note: ""Our elegant Correspondent will highly"
14365,NOTES,gratify every reader of taste by the continuance of his exquisitely
14366,NOTES,"beautiful productions."" The series continued with Burke, Priestley,"
14367,NOTES,"Lafayette, Kosciusko, Chatham, Bowles, and, on December 29, 1794, Mrs."
14368,NOTES,Siddons--the sonnet here printed--all signed S.T.C.
14369,NOTES,
14370,NOTES,But the next appearance of the sonnet was as an effusion by Lamb in
14371,NOTES,"Coleridge's _Poems on Various Subjects_, 1796, signed C.L.; and its next"
14372,NOTES,"in the _Poems_, 1797, among Lamb's contributions. In 1803, however, we"
14373,NOTES,"find it in Coleridge's _Poems_, third edition, with no reference to Lamb"
14374,NOTES,whatever. This probably means that Lamb and Coleridge had written it
14375,NOTES,"together, that Coleridge's original share had been the greater, and that"
14376,NOTES,Lamb and he had come to an arrangement by which Coleridge was to be
14377,NOTES,considered the sole author; for Lamb did not reprint it in 1818 with his
14378,NOTES,other early verse. Writing in 1796 to Coleridge concerning his treatment
14379,NOTES,"of other of Lamb's sonnets, Lamb says: ""That to Mrs. Siddons, now, you"
14380,NOTES,"were welcome to improve, if it had been worth it; but I say unto you"
14381,NOTES,"again, Coleridge, spare my ewe lambs."" Such a distinction drawn between"
14382,NOTES,the sonnet to Mrs. Siddons and the others supports the belief that Lamb
14383,NOTES,had not for it a deeply parental feeling.
14384,NOTES,
14385,NOTES,This was not the only occasion on which Lamb and Coleridge wrote a
14386,NOTES,"sonnet in partnership. Writing to Southey in December, 1794, Coleridge"
14387,NOTES,"says: ""Of the following sonnet, the four _last_ lines were written by"

14418,SONNET,
14419,SONNET,This sonnet passed through various vicissitudes. Lamb had sent it to
14420,SONNET,"Coleridge for his _Poems on Various Subjects_ in 1796, and Coleridge"
14421,SONNET,proceeded to re-model it more in accordance with his own views. The
14422,SONNET,"following version, representing his modifications, was the one that"
14423,SONNET,found its way into print as Lamb's:--
14424,SONNET,
14425,SONNET,Was it some sweet device of faery land
14426,SONNET,"That mock'd my steps with many a lonely glade,"
14427,SONNET,And fancied wand'rings with a fair-hair'd maid?
14428,SONNET,Have these things been? Or did the wizard wand
14429,SONNET,"Of Merlin wave, impregning vacant air,"
14430,SONNET,And kindle up the vision of a smile
14431,SONNET,"In those blue eyes, that seem'd to speak the while"
14432,SONNET,"Such tender things, as might enforce Despair"
14433,SONNET,"To drop the murth'ring knife, and let go by"
14434,SONNET,His fell resolve? Ah me! the lonely glade
14435,SONNET,"Still courts the footsteps of the fair-hair'd maid,"
14436,SONNET,Among whose locks the west-winds love to sigh;
14437,SONNET,"But I forlorn do wander, reckless where,"
14438,SONNET,And mid my wand'rings find no ANNA there!

14442,C.L.,"Lamb naturally protested when the result came under his eyes. ""I love my"
14443,C.L.,"own feelings: they are dear to memory,"" he says in a letter in 1796,"
14444,C.L.,"""though they now and then wake a sigh or a tear. 'Thinking on divers"
14445,C.L.,"things foredone,' I charge you, Coleridge, spare my ewe lambs."" Later,"
14446,C.L.,"when Coleridge's second edition was in preparation, Lamb wrote again"
14447,C.L.,"(January 10, 1797): ""I need not repeat my wishes to have my little"
14448,C.L.,"sonnets printed _verbatim_ my last way. In particular, I fear lest you"

14453,C.L.,"Street."" The phrase ""more than once"" in the foregoing passage needs"
14454,C.L.,"explanation. It refers to the little pamphlet of sonnets, entitled"
14455,C.L.,"_Sonnets from Various Authors_, which Coleridge issued privately in"
14456,C.L.,"1796, and of which only one copy is now known to exist--that preserved"
14457,C.L.,in the Dyce and Forster collection at South Kensington. The little
14458,C.L.,"pamphlet contains twenty-eight sonnets in all, of which three are by"
14459,C.L.,"Bowles, four by Southey, four by Charles Lloyd, four by Coleridge, four"
14460,C.L.,"by Lamb, and others by various writers: all of which were chosen for"
14461,C.L.,their suitability to be bound up with the sonnets of Bowles. Lamb's
14462,C.L.,"sonnets were: ""We were two pretty babes"" (see page 9), ""Was it some"
14463,C.L.,"sweet device"" (printed with Coleridge's alterations), ""When last I"
14464,C.L.,"roved"" (see page 8), and ""O! I could laugh"" (see page 5)."
14465,C.L.,
14466,C.L.,The present sonnet belongs to the series of four love sonnets which is
14467,C.L.,"completed by the one that follows, ""Methinks, how dainty sweet it were,"""
14468,C.L.,"and those on page 8 beginning, ""When last I roved"" and ""A timid grace."""
14469,C.L.,"Anna is believed to have been Ann Simmons, who lived at Blenheims, a"
14470,C.L.,"group of cottages near Blakesware, the house where Mrs. Field, Lamb's"
14471,C.L.,"grandmother, was housekeeper. Mrs. Field died in 1792, after which time"
14472,C.L.,Lamb's long visits to that part of the country probably ceased. He was
14473,C.L.,then seventeen. Nothing is known of Lamb's attachment beyond these
14474,C.L.,"sonnets, the fact that when he lost his reason for a short time in"
14475,C.L.,1795-1796 he attributed the cause to some person unmentioned who is
14476,C.L.,"conjectured to have been Anna, and the occasional references in the Ella"
14477,C.L.,"essays to ""Alice W----"" and to his old passion for her (see ""Dream"
14478,C.L.,"Children"" in particular, in Vol. II). The death of Mrs. Lamb in"
14479,C.L.,"September, 1796, and the duty of caring for and nursing his sister Mary,"
14480,C.L.,"which then devolved upon Charles, put an end to any dreams of private"
14481,C.L.,happiness that he may have been indulging; and his little romance was
14482,C.L.,over. How deep his passion was we are not likely ever to know; but Lamb
14483,C.L.,"thenceforward made very light of it, except in the pensive recollections"
14484,C.L.,"in the essays twenty-five years later. In November, 1796, when sending"
14485,C.L.,"Coleridge poems for his second edition, he says: ""Do not entitle any of"
14486,C.L.,"my _things_ Love Sonnets, as I told you to call 'em; 'twill only make me"
14487,C.L.,look little in my own eyes; for it is a passion of which I retain
14488,C.L.,"nothing.... Thank God, the folly has left me for ever. Not even a review"
14489,C.L.,"of my love verses renews one wayward wish in me...."" Again, in November,"
14490,C.L.,"1796, in another letter to Coleridge, about his poems in the 1797"
14491,C.L.,"edition, Lamb says: ""Oh, my friend! I think sometimes, could I recall"
14492,C.L.,"the days that are past, which among them should I choose? not those"
14493,C.L.,"'merrier days,' not the 'pleasant days of hope,' not 'those wanderings"
14494,C.L.,"with a fair-hair'd maid,' which I have so often and so feelingly"
14495,C.L.,"regretted, but the days, Coleridge, of a _mother's_ fondness for her"
14496,C.L.,"_school-boy_."" Lamb printed this sonnet three times--in 1796, 1797 and"
14497,C.L.,1818.

14504,C.L.,
14505,C.L.,When this sonnet was printed by Coleridge in 1796 the sestet
14506,C.L.,was made to run thus:--
14507,C.L.,
14508,C.L.,"But ah! sweet scenes of fancied bliss, adieu!"
14509,C.L.,On rose-leaf beds amid your faery bowers
14510,C.L.,I all too long have lost the dreamy hours!
14511,C.L.,"Beseems it now the sterner Muse to woo,"
14512,C.L.,"If haply she her golden meed impart,"
14513,C.L.,To realise the vision of the heart.
14514,C.L.,
14515,C.L.,"Lamb remonstrated: ""I had rather have seen what I wrote myself, though"
14516,C.L.,they bear no comparison with your exquisite lines--
14517,C.L.,
14518,C.L.,"""On rose-leaf'd beds, amid your faery bowers, etc."
14519,C.L.,
14520,C.L.,I love my sonnets because they are the reflected images of my Own
14521,C.L.,"feelings at different times."" This sonnet was printed by Lamb three"
14522,C.L.,"times--in 1796, 1797 and 1798."
14523,C.L.,
14524,C.L.,
14525,C.L.,"Page 5. _O! I could laugh to hear the midnight wind,_"
14526,C.L.,
14527,C.L.,"This sonnet, written probably at Margate, was entitled, in 1796,"
14528,C.L.,"""Written at Midnight, by the Seaside, after a Voyage."" The last"
14529,C.L.,lines then ran:--
14530,C.L.,
14531,C.L.,And almost wish'd it were no crime to die!
14532,C.L.,How Reason reel'd! What gloomy transports rose!
14533,C.L.,Till the rude dashings rock'd them to repose.
14534,C.L.,
14535,C.L.,"The couplet was Coleridge's, and Lamb protested (June 10, 1796),"
14536,C.L.,"describing them as good lines, but adding that they ""must spoil"
14537,C.L.,the whole with me who know it is only a fiction of yours and that
14538,C.L.,"the rude dashings did in fact not rock me to repose."""
14539,C.L.,
14540,C.L.,"When reprinted in 1797, the final couplet was omitted, asterisks"
14541,C.L.,standing instead. The present sonnet was probably the earliest of Lamb's
14542,C.L.,"printed poems. In the Elia essay ""The Old Margate Hoy,"" Lamb states that"
14543,C.L.,"the first time he saw the sea was on a visit to Margate as a boy, by"
14544,C.L.,water--probably the voyage that suggested this sonnet. Lamb printed the
14545,C.L.,"sonnet three times--in 1796, 1797 and 1818."

14553,C.L.,"Charles Lloyd (1775-1839), the son of Charles Lloyd, of Birmingham (a"
14554,C.L.,"cultured and philanthropical Quaker banker), joined Coleridge at Bristol"
14555,C.L.,"late in 1796 as his private pupil, and moved with the family to Nether"
14556,C.L.,"Stowey. Priscilla Farmer was Lloyd's maternal grandmother, to whom he"
14557,C.L.,"was much attached, and on her death he composed the sonnets that form"
14558,C.L.,"this costly quarto, published for Lloyd by Coleridge's friend, Joseph"
14559,C.L.,"Cottle, of Bristol, in the winter of 1796."

14563,C.L.,
14564,C.L.,"Lamb sent these lines in their first state to Coleridge in June, 1796,"
14565,C.L.,"at, which time they were, I conjecture, part of a long blank-verse poem"
14566,C.L.,"which he was then meditating, and of which ""Childhood,"" ""Fancy Employed"
14567,C.L.,"on Divine Subjects,"" and ""The Sabbath Bells"" (see pages 9 and 10) were"
14568,C.L.,"probably other portions. The poem was never finished. On June 13, 1796,"
14569,C.L.,he writes to Coleridge:--
14570,C.L.,
14571,C.L.,"""Of the blank verses I spoke of, the following lines are the only"
14572,C.L.,tolerably complete ones I have writ out of not more than one hundred and
14573,C.L.,fifty. That I get on slowly you may fairly impute to want of practice in
14574,C.L.,"composition, when I declare to you that (the few verses which you have"
14575,C.L.,seen excepted) I have not writ fifty lines since I left school. It may
14576,C.L.,not be amiss to remark that my grandmother (on whom the verses are
14577,C.L.,written) lived housekeeper in a family the fifty or sixty last years of
14578,C.L.,her life--that she was a woman of exemplary piety and goodness--and for
14579,C.L.,many years before her death was terribly afflicted with a cancer in her
14580,C.L.,"breast, which she bore with true Christian patience. You may think that"
14581,C.L.,I have not kept enough apart the ideas of her heavenly and her earthly
14582,C.L.,master; but recollect I have designedly given into her own way of
14583,C.L.,feeling; and if she had a failing 'twas that she respected her master's
14584,C.L.,"family too much, not reverenced her Maker too little. The lines begin"
14585,C.L.,"imperfectly, as I may probably connect 'em if I finish at all: and if I"
14586,C.L.,"do, Biggs shall print 'em (in a more economical way than you yours),"
14587,C.L.,"for, Sonnets and all, they won't make a thousand lines as I propose"
14588,C.L.,"completing 'em, and the substance must be wire-drawn."""
14589,C.L.,
14590,C.L.,"When Charles Lloyd joined Coleridge later in the year, and was preparing"
14591,C.L.,"his _Poems in Memory of Priscilla Farmer_, Coleridge obtained Lamb's"
14592,C.L.,"permission for ""The Grandame"" to be included with them. The lines were"
14593,C.L.,"introduced by Lloyd in these words: ""The following beautiful fragment"
14594,C.L.,"was written by CHARLES LAMB, of the India-House.--Its subject being the"
14595,C.L.,"same with that of my Poems, I was solicitous to have it printed with"
14596,C.L.,"them: and I am indebted to a Friend of the Author's for the permission."""
14597,C.L.,
14598,C.L.,The poem differed then very slightly from its present form. When the
14599,C.L.,"book was sent to Lamb he remarked (in December, 1796) on ""the odd"
14600,C.L.,"coincidence of two young men, in one age, carolling their"
14601,C.L.,grandmothers.... I cannot but smile to see my Granny so gayly deck'd
14602,C.L.,"forth [the book was expensively produced by Lloyd], tho', I think,"
14603,C.L.,whoever altered 'thy' praises to 'her' praises--'thy' honoured memory to
14604,C.L.,"'her' honoured memory [lines 27 and 28], did wrong--they best exprest my"
14605,C.L.,"feelings. There is a pensive state of recollection, in which the mind is"
14606,C.L.,"disposed to apostrophise the departed objects of its attachment; and,"
14607,C.L.,"breaking loose from grammatical precision, changes from the 1st to the"
14608,C.L.,"3rd, and from the 3rd to the 1st person, just as the random fancy or"
14609,C.L.,"feeling directs."""
14610,C.L.,
14611,C.L.,"Mrs. Mary Field, _n√©e_ Bruton, Lamb's maternal grandmother, was"
14612,C.L.,"housekeeper at Blakesware house, near Widford, the seat of the Plumer"
14613,C.L.,"family for very many years, during the latter part of her life being"
14614,C.L.,"left in sole charge, for William Plumer had moved to his other seat,"
14615,C.L.,"Gilston, a few miles distant (see ""Blakesmoor in H---- shire,"" and"
14616,C.L.,"notes, Vol. II). Lamb and his brother and sister visited their"
14617,C.L.,grandmother at Blakesware as though in her own house. Mrs. Field died of
14618,C.L.,"cancer in the breast, July 31, 1792, aged seventy-nine, and was buried"
14619,C.L.,in Widford churchyard.
14620,C.L.,
14621,C.L.,Approached from the east the churchyard seems to be anything but on the
14622,C.L.,"hilltop, for one descends to it; but it stands on a ridge, and seen from"
14623,C.L.,"the north, or, as at the old Blakesware house, from the west, it appears"
14624,C.L.,"to crown an eminence. The present spire, though slender and tapering, is"
14625,C.L.,"not that which Lamb used to see. Mrs. Field's plain stone, whose"
14626,C.L.,"legibility was not long since threatened by overhanging branches, has"
14627,C.L.,now been saved from danger and may still be read. It merely records the
14628,C.L.,"name ""Mary Feild"" (a mistake of the stone-cutter) and the bare dates."
14629,C.L.,
14630,C.L.,"This poem was printed by Lamb three times--in 1796 (in Lloyd's book), in"
14631,C.L.,1797 (with Coleridge) and in 1818.

14640,C.L.,"edition in 1797 under the title, _Poems by S.T. Coleridge, Second"
14641,C.L.,"Edition, to which are now added Poems by Charles Lamb and Charles"
14642,C.L.,"Lloyd_. Coleridge invented a motto from Groscollius for the title-page,"
14643,C.L.,"bearing upon this poetical partnership: ""Duplex nobis vinculum, et"
14644,C.L.,amicitiae et similium junctarumque Camoenarum; quod utinam neque mors
14645,C.L.,"solvat, neque temporis longinquitas!"" ""Double is the bond which binds"

14647,C.L.,"nor lapse of time could dissolve it!"""
14648,C.L.,
14649,C.L.,Lamb's contributions were thus referred to by Coleridge in the Preface:
14650,C.L.,"""There were inserted in my former Edition, a few Sonnets of my Friend"
14651,C.L.,"and old School-fellow, CHARLES LAMB. He has now communicated to me a"

14654,C.L.,"unreservedly in love with, is detested by all the Virtues and the"
14655,C.L.,"Graces.) Lamb's poems came last in the book, an arrangement insisted"
14656,C.L.,"upon in a letter from him to Coleridge in November, 1796:--""Do you"
14657,C.L.,"publish with Lloyd, or without him? In either case my little portion may"

15613,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,devoted to Mary Lamb and her brother. When these two were at work on

15619,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"Sarah Hazlitt, Lamb says:--""Martin Burney is as good, and as odd as"
15620,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"ever. We had a dispute about the word 'heir,' which I contended was"
15621,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,pronounced like 'air'; he said that might be in common parlance; or that
15622,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"we might so use it, speaking of the 'Heir at Law,' a comedy; but that in"
15623,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"the law courts it was necessary to give it a full aspiration, and to say"
15624,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"_hayer_; he thought it might even vitiate a cause, if a counsel"
15625,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"pronounced it otherwise. In conclusion, he 'would consult Serjeant"
15626,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"Wilde,' who gave it against him. Sometimes he falleth into the water;"
15627,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"sometimes into the fire. He came down here, and insisted on reading"
15628,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"Virgil's 'Eneid' all through with me (which he did), because a Counsel"
15629,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"must know Latin. Another time he read out all the Gospel of St. John,"
15630,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,because Biblical quotations are very emphatic in a Court of Justice. A
15631,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,"third time, he would carve a fowl, which he did very ill-favouredly,"
15632,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,because 'we did not know how indispensable it was for a barrister to do
15633,MON NOM DE FAMILLE,all those sort of things well? Those little things were of more

16267,COMMENDATORY VERSES,"to Fornham, in Suffolk, in 1830, to bring her home. On returning he"
16268,COMMENDATORY VERSES,"wrote Mrs. Williams several letters, in one of which, dated Good Friday,"

16300,TRANSLATIONS,"that Cowper, one of his pupils, says: ""He seemed determined, as he was"
16301,TRANSLATIONS,"the best, so to be the last, Latin poet of the Westminster line."""
16302,TRANSLATIONS,Bourne's _Poemata_ appeared in 1734. It is mainly owing to Cowper's
16303,TRANSLATIONS,"translations (particularly ""The Jackdaw"") that he is known, except to"
16304,TRANSLATIONS,Latinists. Lamb first read Bourne in 1815. Writing to Wordsworth in
16305,TRANSLATIONS,"April of that year he says:--""Since I saw you I have had a treat in the"

16311,TRANSLATIONS,"epigram on the old woman who taught Newton the A B C, which after all he"

16317,TRANSLATIONS,shutting his eyes and thinking he is in the age of the old Elisabeth

17259,TO CHARLES LAMB,
17260,TO CHARLES LAMB,"Lamb was not a politician, but he had strong--almost"
17261,TO CHARLES LAMB,"passionate--prejudices against certain statesmen and higher persons,"
17262,TO CHARLES LAMB,which impelled him now and then to sarcastic verse. The earliest
17263,TO CHARLES LAMB,examples in this vein that can be identified are two quatrains from the
17264,TO CHARLES LAMB,"_Morning Post_ in January, 1802, printed on page 115, and the epigram"
17265,TO CHARLES LAMB,"on Sir James Mackintosh in _The Albion_, printed on the same page, to"
17266,TO CHARLES LAMB,"which Lamb refers in the _Elia_ essay on ""Newspapers Thirty-five Years"
17267,TO CHARLES LAMB,"Ago"" (see Vol. II.). Until a file of _The Albion_ turns up we shall"
17268,TO CHARLES LAMB,never know how active Lamb's pen was at that time. The next belong to
17269,TO CHARLES LAMB,the year 1812--in _The Examiner_ (see page 116)--and we then leap
17270,TO CHARLES LAMB,"another seven years or so until 1819-1820, Lamb's busiest period as a"
17271,TO CHARLES LAMB,"caustic critic of affairs--in _The Examiner_, possibly the _Morning"
17272,TO CHARLES LAMB,"Chronicle_, and principally in _The Champion_. After 1820, however, he"
17273,TO CHARLES LAMB,"returned to this vein very seldom, and then with less bitterness and"
17274,TO CHARLES LAMB,"depth of feeling. ""The Royal Wonders,"" in _The Times_ for August 10,"
17275,TO CHARLES LAMB,"1830 (see page 122), and ""Lines Suggested by a Sight of Waltham Cross,"""
17276,TO CHARLES LAMB,"in the _Englishman's Magazine_, September, 1831 (written, however, some"
17277,TO CHARLES LAMB,"years earlier), on page 121, being his latest efforts that we know of."
17278,TO CHARLES LAMB,Of course there must be many other similar productions to which we have
17279,TO CHARLES LAMB,no clue--the old _Morning Post_ days doubtless saw many an epigram that
17280,TO CHARLES LAMB,cannot now be definitely claimed for Lamb--but those that are preserved
17281,TO CHARLES LAMB,here sufficiently show how feelingly Lamb could hate and how trenchantly
17282,TO CHARLES LAMB,he could chastise. Others that seem to me likely to be Lamb's I could
17283,TO CHARLES LAMB,have included; but it is well to dispense as much as possible with the
17284,TO CHARLES LAMB,"problematic. For example, I suspect Lamb of the authorship of several of"
17285,TO CHARLES LAMB,the epigrams quoted in _The Examiner_ in 1819 and 1820 from the _Morning
17286,TO CHARLES LAMB,Chronicle_. He used to send verses to the _Morning Chronicle_ at that
17287,TO CHARLES LAMB,"time, and Leigh Hunt, the editor of _The Examiner_, would naturally be"
17288,TO CHARLES LAMB,pleased to give anything of his friend's an additional publicity.
17289,TO CHARLES LAMB,
17290,TO CHARLES LAMB,The majority of the epigrams printed in this section might have remained
17291,TO CHARLES LAMB,"unidentified were it not that in 1822 John Thelwall, who owned and"
17292,TO CHARLES LAMB,"edited _The Champion_ in 1818-1820, issued a little volume entitled _The"
17293,TO CHARLES LAMB,"Poetical Recreations of ""The Champion,""_ wherein Lamb's contributions"
17294,TO CHARLES LAMB,were signed R. et R. This signature being appended to certain poems of
17295,TO CHARLES LAMB,"which we know Lamb to have been the author--as ""The Three Graves,"" which"
17296,TO CHARLES LAMB,"he sent also to the _London Magazine_ (in 1825), and which he was in the"
17297,TO CHARLES LAMB,habit of reading or reciting to his friends--enables us to ascertain the
17298,TO CHARLES LAMB,authorship of the others. A note placed by Thelwall above the index of
17299,TO CHARLES LAMB,"the book states, ""it is much to be regretted that, by mere oversight, or"
17300,TO CHARLES LAMB,"rather mistake, several of the printed epigrams of R. et R. have been"
17301,TO CHARLES LAMB,"omitted;"" but a search through the files of _The Champion_ has failed to"
17302,TO CHARLES LAMB,bring to light any others with Lamb's adopted signature.
17303,TO CHARLES LAMB,
17304,TO CHARLES LAMB,The origin of the signature R. et R. is unknown. Mr. Percy Fitzgerald
17305,TO CHARLES LAMB,"suggests that it might stand for Romulus and Remus, but offers no"
17306,TO CHARLES LAMB,supporting theory. He might have added that so unfamiliar a countenance
17307,TO CHARLES LAMB,"is in these epigrams shown by their author, that the suggestion of a"
17308,TO CHARLES LAMB,wolf rather than a Lamb might have been intended.  Lamb's principal
17309,TO CHARLES LAMB,political epigrams were drawn from him by his intense contempt for the
17310,TO CHARLES LAMB,"character of George IV., then Prince of Wales. His treatment of Caroline"
17311,TO CHARLES LAMB,"of Brunswick, as we see, moved Lamb to utterances of almost sulphurous"
17312,TO CHARLES LAMB,"indignation not only for the prince himself, but for all who were on his"
17313,TO CHARLES LAMB,"side, particularly Canning. Lamb, we must suppose, was wholly on the"
17314,TO CHARLES LAMB,"side of the queen, thus differing from Coleridge, who when asked how his"
17315,TO CHARLES LAMB,sympathies were placed would admit only to being anti-Prince.
17316,TO CHARLES LAMB,
17317,TO CHARLES LAMB,John Thelwall (1764-1834)--Citizen Thelwall--was one of the most popular
17318,TO CHARLES LAMB,and uncompromising of the Radicals of the seventeen-nineties. He
17319,TO CHARLES LAMB,belonged to the Society of the Friends of the People and other Jacobin
17320,TO CHARLES LAMB,"confederacies. In May, 1794, he was even sent to the Tower (with Home"
17321,TO CHARLES LAMB,Tooke and Thomas Hardy) for sedition; moved to Newgate in October; and
17322,TO CHARLES LAMB,"tried and acquitted in December. Lamb first met him, I fancy, in 1797,"
17323,TO CHARLES LAMB,when Thelwall was intimate with Coleridge. After 1798 Thelwall's
17324,TO CHARLES LAMB,political activities were changed for those of a lecturer on more
17325,TO CHARLES LAMB,"pacific subjects, and later he opened an institution in London where he"
17326,TO CHARLES LAMB,taught elocution and corrected the effects of malformation of the organs
17327,TO CHARLES LAMB,"of speech. He bought _The Champion_ in 1818, and held it for two or"
17328,TO CHARLES LAMB,"three years, but it did not succeed. Thelwall died in 1834. Among his"
17329,TO CHARLES LAMB,"friends were Coleridge, Haydon, Hazlitt, Southey, Crabb Robinson and"
17330,TO CHARLES LAMB,"Lamb, all of whom, although they laughed at his excesses and excitements"
17331,TO CHARLES LAMB,"as a reformer, saw in him an invincible honesty and sincerity."
17332,TO CHARLES LAMB,
17333,TO CHARLES LAMB,Before leaving this subject I should like to quote the following
17334,TO CHARLES LAMB,"lines from _The Champion_ of November 4 and 5, 1820:--"
17335,TO CHARLES LAMB,

17357,M.L.,"following day--for _The Champion_, like _The Examiner_, had a Saturday"
17358,M.L.,"and Sunday edition--this signature was changed to M.L., and was thus"
17359,M.L.,given when the verses were reprinted in _The Poetical Recreations_ of
17360,M.L.,"_""The Champion""_ in 1822. There is no evidence that Mary Lamb wrote it;"
17361,M.L.,"but she played with verse, and presumably read _The Champion_, since her"
17362,M.L.,"brother was writing for it, and the poem might easily be hers."
17363,M.L.,"Personally I like to think it is, and that Lamb, on seeing the mistake"
17364,M.L.,"in the initials in the Saturday edition, hurried down to the office to"
17365,M.L.,have it put right in that of Sunday. The same number of _The Champion_
17366,M.L.,"(November 4 and 5, 1820) contains another poem in the same measure"
17367,M.L.,"signed C., which not improbably was Lamb's contribution to the pastime."

17392,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,
17393,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"In a letter to Manning in August, 1801, Lamb quotes this epigram as"
17394,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,having been printed in _The Albion_ and caused that paper's death the
17395,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"previous week. In his _Elia_ essay on ""Newspapers,"" written thirty years"
17396,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"later, he stated that the epigram was written at the time of"
17397,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,Mackintosh's departure for India to reap the fruits of his apostasy; but
17398,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"here Lamb's memory deceived him, for Mackintosh was not appointed"
17399,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"Recorder of Bombay until 1803 and did not sail until 1804, whereas there"
17400,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"is reason to believe the date of Lamb's letter to Manning of August,"
17401,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"1801, to be accurate. The epigram must then have referred to a rumour of"
17402,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"some earlier appointment, for Mackintosh had been hoping for something"
17403,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,for several years.
17404,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,
17405,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"Sir James Mackintosh (1765-1832), the lawyer and philosopher, had in"
17406,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"1791 issued his _Vindicia Galliae_, a reply to Burke's _Reflections on"
17407,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"the French Revolution_. Later, however, he became one of Burke's friends"
17408,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"and an opponent of the Revolution, and in 1798 he issued his"
17409,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"Introductory Discourse to his lectures on ""The Law of Nature and"
17410,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"Nations,"" in which the doctrines of his _Vindiciae Gallicae_ were"
17411,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"repudiated. Hence his ""apostasy."" Mackintosh applied unsuccessfully for"
17412,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"a judgeship in Trinidad, and for the post of Advocate-General in Bengal,"
17413,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,and Lord Wellesley had invited him to become the head of a college in
17414,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,Calcutta. Rumour may have credited him with any of these posts and thus
17415,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,have suggested Lamb's epigram. In 1803 he was appointed Recorder of
17416,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,Bombay. Lamb's dislike of Mackintosh may have been due in some measure
17417,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"to Coleridge, between whom and Mackintosh a mild feud subsisted. It had"
17418,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"been Mackintosh, however, brother-in-law of Daniel Stuart of the"
17419,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,"_Morning Post_, who introduced Coleridge to that paper. (See notes to"

17422,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,
17423,DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT,Lamb may or may not have invented the sarcasm in this epigram; but it

17755,THE POETICAL CASK,"These epigrams were written for the sons of James Augustus Hessey, the"
17756,THE POETICAL CASK,"publisher, two Merchant Taylor boys. In _The Taylorian_ for March, 1884,"
17757,THE POETICAL CASK,"the magazine of the Merchant Taylors' School, the late Archdeacon"
17758,THE POETICAL CASK,"Hessey, one of the boys in question, told the story of their authorship."
17759,THE POETICAL CASK,It was a custom many years ago for Election Day at Merchant Taylors'
17760,THE POETICAL CASK,"School to be marked by the recitation of original epigrams in Greek,"
17761,THE POETICAL CASK,"Latin and English, which, although the boys themselves were usually the"
17762,THE POETICAL CASK,"authors, might also be the work of other hands. Archdeacon Hessey and"
17763,THE POETICAL CASK,"his brother, as the following passage explains, resorted to Charles Lamb"
17764,THE POETICAL CASK,for assistance:--
17765,THE POETICAL CASK,
17766,THE POETICAL CASK,The subjects for 1830 were _Suum Cuique_ and _Brevis esse latoro_.
17767,THE POETICAL CASK,After some three or four exercise nights I confess that I was literally
17768,THE POETICAL CASK,"""at my wits' end."" But a brilliant idea struck me. I had frequently, boy"
17769,THE POETICAL CASK,"as I was, seen Charles Lamb (Elia) at my father's house, and once, in"
17770,THE POETICAL CASK,"1825 or 1826, I had been taken to have tea with him and his sister, Mary"
17771,THE POETICAL CASK,"Lamb, at their little house, Colebrook Cottage, a whitish-brown"
17772,THE POETICAL CASK,"tenement, standing by itself, close to the New River, at Islington. He"
17773,THE POETICAL CASK,"was very kind, as he always was to young people, and very quaint. I told"
17774,THE POETICAL CASK,"him that I had devoured his ""Roast Pig;"" he congratulated me on"
17775,THE POETICAL CASK,possessing a thorough schoolboy's appetite. And he was pleased when I
17776,THE POETICAL CASK,mentioned my having seen the boys at Christ's Hospital at their public
17777,THE POETICAL CASK,"suppers, which then took place on the Sunday evenings in Lent. ""Could"
17778,THE POETICAL CASK,this good-natured and humorous old gentleman be prevailed upon to give
17779,THE POETICAL CASK,"me an Epigram?"" ""I don't know,"" said my father, to whom I put the"
17780,THE POETICAL CASK,"question, ""but I will ask him at any rate, and send him the mottoes."" In"
17781,THE POETICAL CASK,"a day or two there arrived from Enfield, to which Lamb had removed some"
17782,THE POETICAL CASK,"time in 1827, not one, but two epigrams, one on each subject. That on"
17783,THE POETICAL CASK,"_Suum Cuique_ was in Latin, and was suggested by the grim satisfaction"
17784,THE POETICAL CASK,which had recently been expressed by the public at the capture and
17785,THE POETICAL CASK,execution of some notorious highwayman. That on _Brevis esse laboro_ was
17786,THE POETICAL CASK,"in English, and might have represented an adventure which had befallen"
17787,THE POETICAL CASK,"Lamb himself, for he stammered frequently, though he was not so grievous"
17788,THE POETICAL CASK,"a _Balbulus_ as his friend George Darley, whom I had also often seen. I"
17789,THE POETICAL CASK,"need scarcely say that the two Epigrams were highly appreciated, and"
17790,THE POETICAL CASK,"that my brother and myself, for I gave my brother one of them, were"
17791,THE POETICAL CASK,objects of envy to our schoolfellows.

17796,THE POETICAL CASK,"""_Suum Cuique_,"" which was signed F. Hessey, was thus translated by its"

17799,THE POETICAL CASK,"A thief, on dreary Bagshot's heath well known,"
17800,THE POETICAL CASK,Was fond of making others' goods his own;
17801,THE POETICAL CASK,"_Meum_ was never thought of, nor was _Tuum_,"
17802,THE POETICAL CASK,But everything with him was counted _Suum_.
17803,THE POETICAL CASK,"At length each gets his own, and no one grieves;"

17805,THE POETICAL CASK,His body to dissecting knife has gone;

17807,THE POETICAL CASK,
17808,THE POETICAL CASK,"The English epigram, which was signed J.A. Hessey, was a rhyming version"
17809,THE POETICAL CASK,"of a story which Lamb was fond of telling. Three, at least, of his"
17810,THE POETICAL CASK,friends relate the story in their recollections of him: Mrs. Mathews in
17811,THE POETICAL CASK,her life of her husband; Leigh Hunt in _The Companion_; and De Quincey
17812,THE POETICAL CASK,in _Fraser's Magazine_. The incident possibly occurred to Lamb when as a
17813,THE POETICAL CASK,boy--or little more--he stayed at Margate about 1790. Lamb must have
17814,THE POETICAL CASK,"written Merchant Taylors' epigrams before, for in 1803, in a letter to"
17815,THE POETICAL CASK,"Godwin about writing to order, he speaks of having undertaken, three or"
17816,THE POETICAL CASK,"four times, a schoolboy copy of verses for Merchant Taylors' boys at a"

17820,THE POETICAL CASK,"Writing to Southey on May 10, 1830, Lamb said, at the end:--""Perhaps"
