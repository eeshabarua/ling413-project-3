127,_BLASCO._,
128,_BLASCO._,Have you not been in Sicily before?
129,_BLASCO._,
130,_FERDINAND._,_FERDINAND._
131,_FERDINAND._,
132,_FERDINAND._,Never.
133,_FERDINAND._,
134,_FERDINAND._,"_Bl._    And, sir, what think you of Palermo?"
135,_FERDINAND._,Have you as fine cities in Spain?
136,_FERDINAND._,
137,_FERDINAND._,"_Fer._                            Your city,"
138,_FERDINAND._,"Approached by sea or from the roofs surveyed,"
139,_FERDINAND._,Smiles back upon the gazer like a queen
140,_FERDINAND._,"That hears her praise. Nearer to speak I’ll grudge not,"
141,_FERDINAND._,When I may nearer know: but since we came
142,_FERDINAND._,There’s been no hour a stranger might dare shew
143,_FERDINAND._,His face in the streets.
144,_FERDINAND._,
145,_FERDINAND._,_Bl._                    The time is now unquiet.
146,_FERDINAND._,
147,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._ Rather I’d say government given over                       10
148,_FERDINAND._,"To murderous bandits, who range up and down"
149,_FERDINAND._,Unchecked: to whom the king’s commissioners
150,_FERDINAND._,Were just the daintiest pricking. If I may brag
151,_FERDINAND._,"Of home, our cities are more orderly."
152,_FERDINAND._,
153,_FERDINAND._,"_Bl._ ’Tis a hot-blooded race, sir, full of stirrings,"
154,_FERDINAND._,"Subject to fermentation, and like good wine"
155,_FERDINAND._,Ever the better for it.
156,_FERDINAND._,
157,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                  But can you tell me
158,_FERDINAND._,The real cause of these disturbances?
159,_FERDINAND._,
160,_FERDINAND._,"_Bl._ Nothing is easier, sir. Your viceroy, Hugo,"
161,_FERDINAND._,"This is the point, is plunged in disesteem.                       20"
162,_FERDINAND._,He has lost the fear and won the hate of the people.
163,_FERDINAND._,"Already, ere ye came, the news ye bring"
164,_FERDINAND._,"Of the king being dead, was buzzed. Since at his death"
165,_FERDINAND._,"His viceroy’s office falls to ground, our townsmen"
166,_FERDINAND._,"Seize on this interval, wherein they hold"
167,_FERDINAND._,"He hath no jurisdiction, to discredit him,"
168,_FERDINAND._,"Kill him maybe, if nothing else will hinder"
169,_FERDINAND._,His reappointment. They but make the most
170,_FERDINAND._,Of their occasion: that is all.
171,_FERDINAND._,
172,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                           But how
173,_FERDINAND._,Can a mere handful of such ruffians hold                          30
174,_FERDINAND._,"The city, when the loyal troops are his?"
175,_FERDINAND._,
176,_FERDINAND._,_Bl._ ’Tis known to the people that their cause hath found
177,_FERDINAND._,An ear in Spain: and here among the barons
178,_FERDINAND._,Are many who wish well to the revolt.
179,_FERDINAND._,Should Hugo push to extremes he might discover
180,_FERDINAND._,"Most potent enemies. Remember, sir,"
181,_FERDINAND._,"’Twas a street scuffle in this very town,"
182,_FERDINAND._,That drave the French from Sicily.
183,_FERDINAND._,
184,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                             The thought
185,_FERDINAND._,Brings me no comfort.
186,_FERDINAND._,
187,_FERDINAND._,_Bl._                 Wherefore ’tis his policy
188,_FERDINAND._,To meet the present rage by such concessions                      40
189,_FERDINAND._,"As may be popular, and to give forth"
190,_FERDINAND._,"The king is ill, not dead. ’Tis for this reason"
191,_FERDINAND._,No mass is sung nor mourning liveries worn:
192,_FERDINAND._,"To-night’s festivity, such as it is,"
193,_FERDINAND._,Hath only this pretence.
194,_FERDINAND._,
195,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                   Are the two ladies
196,_FERDINAND._,His daughters both?
197,_FERDINAND._,
198,_FERDINAND._,"_Bl._               The taller and the fairer,"
199,_FERDINAND._,"The lady Constance, is his only daughter."
200,_FERDINAND._,"Your fine duke Philip, who comes now from court"
201,_FERDINAND._,"With such a mightiness, was once her lover."
202,_FERDINAND._,
203,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._ That doth not single her.
204,_FERDINAND._,
205,_FERDINAND._,_Bl._                            But then it did.                 50
206,_FERDINAND._,She was his first. ’Twas when duke Philip’s father
207,_FERDINAND._,"Was viceroy here; Hugo was then chief justice,"
208,_FERDINAND._,"And Manuel, who succeeded him, was only"
209,_FERDINAND._,Young Philip’s tutor;—he succeeds moreover
210,_FERDINAND._,"Now to his pupil’s leavings, and will marry"
211,_FERDINAND._,The long-forgotten Constance.
212,_FERDINAND._,
213,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                        ’Twas the other
214,_FERDINAND._,"I asked of, in white satin, she who sat"
215,_FERDINAND._,On Philip’s right at supper; who is she?
216,_FERDINAND._,
217,_FERDINAND._,"_Bl._ That, sir, is Margaret."
218,_FERDINAND._,
219,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                        And who is Margaret?
220,_FERDINAND._,
221,_FERDINAND._,_Bl._ Sister to Manuel.
222,_FERDINAND._,
223,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                  She far outshines                         60
224,_FERDINAND._,Her future sister.
225,_FERDINAND._,
226,_FERDINAND._,_Bl._              They that can see have thought it:
227,_FERDINAND._,"And, sir, ’twill tax your better wit to add"
228,_FERDINAND._,A tittle to her full accustomed homage.
229,_FERDINAND._,Your broken heart were but a pinch of pepper
230,_FERDINAND._,Sprinkled on porridge. Now for full two years
231,_FERDINAND._,Her reign hath made a melancholy madness
232,_FERDINAND._,The fashion ’mongst our youth.
233,_FERDINAND._,
234,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._                         I should much like
235,_FERDINAND._,To be presented.
236,_FERDINAND._,
237,_FERDINAND._,"_Bl._            O, sir, at your will."
238,_FERDINAND._,"Judge for yourself. See, here they come. (_Aside._) A moth!"
239,_FERDINAND._,
240,_FERDINAND._,_Fer._ (_aside_). A very civil fellow.
241,_FERDINAND._,
242,_FERDINAND._,[_They retire to back._
243,_FERDINAND._,
244,_FERDINAND._,"_Enter_ R. _Hugo_, _Philip_, _Manuel_, _Margaret_,"
245,_FERDINAND._,_Constance and Livio_.
246,_FERDINAND._,
247,_HUGO._,_HUGO._
248,_HUGO._,
249,_HUGO._,"I am sorry, your grace,"
250,_HUGO._,We make so small a party. For our poor                            71
251,_HUGO._,"Reception, and for all shortcomings else,"
252,_HUGO._,Accuse the occasion.
253,_HUGO._,
254,_PHILIP._,_PHILIP._
255,_PHILIP._,
256,_PHILIP._,"I think, your excellence,"
257,_PHILIP._,I cannot play the guest. This house was once
258,_PHILIP._,"So long my home, that here I look to find"
259,_PHILIP._,As little ceremony as I fear I have shewn.
260,_PHILIP._,
261,_PHILIP._,_Hu._ So should it be. Make it your home again.
262,_PHILIP._,
263,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ I shall forget I have ever been away.
264,_PHILIP._,
265,_MANUEL._,_MANUEL._
266,_MANUEL._,
267,_MANUEL._,Five years.
268,_MANUEL._,
269,_MANUEL._,"_Ph._         Ay, but five years of wandering,"
270,_MANUEL._,Such as can but endear one’s home the more.                       80
271,_MANUEL._,My memory still would serve me to walk blindfold
272,_MANUEL._,From any point of the city to these doors.
273,_MANUEL._,
274,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ What is your memory for our studies, Philip?"
275,_MANUEL._,
276,_MANUEL._,_Ph._ Too slippery for my profit. Yet the pleasure
277,_MANUEL._,"Lives very brightly;—nay, I could but name"
278,_MANUEL._,One deprivation I have more regretted.
279,_MANUEL._,
280,_MARGARET._,_MARGARET._
281,_MARGARET._,
282,_MARGARET._,But now
283,_MARGARET._,My brother has a new philosophy.
284,_MARGARET._,
285,_MARGARET._,"_Ph._ Ah! If you share the secret, and I be thought"
286,_MARGARET._,"Worthy of initiation, may I hear it?"
287,_MARGARET._,
288,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ And welcome. Manuel, in his deep research"
289,_MARGARET._,"For the first cause and harmony of things,                        91"
290,_MARGARET._,Hit upon both together—they are one:
291,_MARGARET._,"’Tis love. And now, since I profess it not,"
292,_MARGARET._,And since ’twas learnt of you...
293,_MARGARET._,
294,_MARGARET._,"_Man._ (_to Mar._).              Hush, sister, hush!"
295,_MARGARET._,
296,_MARGARET._,_Ph._ I am very proud of such a pupil. (_Aside._) Since
297,_MARGARET._,"He has learned my love so readily, it may be"
298,_MARGARET._,That he may catch my jealousy—
299,_MARGARET._,
300,_MARGARET._,"_Hu._                           Come, duke,"
301,_MARGARET._,"Sit here by me. There’s more to talk of. Livio,"
302,_MARGARET._,Fetch us the papers.
303,_MARGARET._,
304,_MARGARET._,_Philip crosses to_ L. _and sits by Hugo_.
305,_MARGARET._,
306,_MARGARET._,"_Man._ (_crossing to_ R.). They must grant us, Constance,"
307,_MARGARET._,"A moment now. All day I have been away,                          100"
308,_MARGARET._,And yesterday I saw you not at all.
309,_MARGARET._,Can you forgive a lover so remiss?
310,_MARGARET._,
311,_CONSTANCE._,_CONSTANCE._
312,_CONSTANCE._,
313,_CONSTANCE._,I fear I half deserve your fear.
314,_CONSTANCE._,
315,_CONSTANCE._,_Man._                             The time
316,_CONSTANCE._,"Can be but short, but it shall make amends."
317,_CONSTANCE._,
318,_CONSTANCE._,[_They talk together._
319,_CONSTANCE._,
320,_CONSTANCE._,"_Bl._ (_coming forward with Fer._). Fair lady Margaret,"
321,_CONSTANCE._,Count Ferdinand of Vergas; I present him
322,_CONSTANCE._,At his desire.
323,_CONSTANCE._,
324,_CONSTANCE._,_Fer._         Your ladyship’s true servant.
325,_CONSTANCE._,
326,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ I am much honoured.
327,_CONSTANCE._,
328,_CONSTANCE._,"_Fer._                     Lady, ’tis worth the pains"
329,_CONSTANCE._,To cross from Spain to see you.
330,_CONSTANCE._,
331,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                          From that I guess
332,_CONSTANCE._,That you are a better sailor than the duke.                      110
333,_CONSTANCE._,
334,_CONSTANCE._,"_Fer._ Nay, you judge wrong."
335,_CONSTANCE._,
336,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                       Have you then ate no dinner?
337,_CONSTANCE._,
338,_CONSTANCE._,"_Fer._ Now if I had not, I’d blame your stormy town"
339,_CONSTANCE._,Before the sea for that: since we left ship
340,_CONSTANCE._,We are cabined in this house; to pass the door
341,_CONSTANCE._,Were to leap overboard in a whole gale.
342,_CONSTANCE._,
343,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._ I fear this is no country for you, sir,"
344,_CONSTANCE._,If noises in the street keep you indoors.
345,_CONSTANCE._,
346,_LIVIO._,_LIVIO._
347,_LIVIO._,
348,_LIVIO._,"Take warning, count; Sicily’s fairest rose"
349,_LIVIO._,Blooms on an angry plant.
350,_LIVIO._,
351,_LIVIO._,_Mar._                    But we can boast
352,_LIVIO._,Of warriors that for fragrance shame the rose.                   120
353,_LIVIO._,(_To Liv._) Is’t musk to-day?
354,_LIVIO._,
355,_LIVIO._,_Liv._ (_to Fer._).           I told you.
356,_LIVIO._,
357,_LIVIO._,"_Enter Messenger_ R., _crosses to Hugo_ L."
358,_LIVIO._,
359,_MESSENGER._,_MESSENGER._
360,_MESSENGER._,
361,_MESSENGER._,"This paper, sire, is posted thro’ the town."
362,_MESSENGER._,
363,_MESSENGER._,"_Hu._ Eh, eh! what have we here?                          [_Reads._"
364,_MESSENGER._,
365,_MESSENGER._,"_Citizens of Palermo, King Pedro is dead. God rest his soul! The"
366,_MESSENGER._,"office of Viceroy being vacant, the Parliament of townsmen, assembled"
367,_MESSENGER._,"in the church of San Lorenzo, have this day elected Manuel to be your"
368,_MESSENGER._,"viceroy, in place of Hugo. Death to Hugo! Long live the king!_"
369,_MESSENGER._,
370,_MESSENGER._,"Why, Manuel, what’s this parliament?"
371,_MESSENGER._,
372,_MESSENGER._,_Man._                               I know                      130
373,_MESSENGER._,No more than doth your excellence. But ’tis plain
374,_MESSENGER._,That they are orderers who put on a dress
375,_MESSENGER._,Of regular authority; they use
376,_MESSENGER._,"The senatorial voice, and over all"
377,_MESSENGER._,They have now usurped my name to have it thought
378,_MESSENGER._,That I have set their hatch.
379,_MESSENGER._,
380,_MESSENGER._,[_Shouts without of “Death to Hugo! The Despatches!”_]
381,_MESSENGER._,
382,_MESSENGER._,_Ph._                        Here comes the parliament.
383,_MESSENGER._,
384,_MESSENGER._,"_Hu._ Now this is what I feared. Manuel, I pray you,"
385,_MESSENGER._,"Go to the balcony, you have their ear;"
386,_MESSENGER._,Use then your credit.
387,_MESSENGER._,
388,_MESSENGER._,"_Man._                What, sire, shall I say?"
389,_MESSENGER._,

391,_MESSENGER._,
392,_MESSENGER._,"_Liv._ (_to Man._).          Look, if they ask to hear"
393,_MESSENGER._,"The last despatches, gull them with some paper;"
394,_MESSENGER._,"Which while you show, you make as if therefrom"
395,_MESSENGER._,You read the king’s not dead.
396,_MESSENGER._,
397,_MESSENGER._,"_Ph._ (_to Liv._).            Nay, Livio:"
398,_MESSENGER._,The word is wanted for a troop of horse.
399,_MESSENGER._,My father never would have brooked this insult
400,_MESSENGER._,From such a mob.
401,_MESSENGER._,
402,_MESSENGER._,_Liv._           Our soldiers are not idle.
403,_MESSENGER._,They laid hands yesterday upon the chief
404,_MESSENGER._,"And head of all, one John Palicio."
405,_MESSENGER._,We have certain information that the rebels
406,_MESSENGER._,Cannot be kept together but by him.                              150
407,_MESSENGER._,Hark! they are quiet now.
408,_MESSENGER._,
409,_MESSENGER._,_Hu._ (_to Man. returning_). What is your charm
410,_MESSENGER._,To win such meek obedience?
411,_MESSENGER._,
412,_MESSENGER._,"_Man._                      They’re gone, your excellence;"
413,_MESSENGER._,But not from aught I said: for ere I spoke
414,_MESSENGER._,"Some rumour reached them, and the skirt of the throng,"
415,_MESSENGER._,That far beyond my hearing stood apart
416,_MESSENGER._,"In scattered groups, broke hastily away:"
417,_MESSENGER._,Then the next ranks shed off; and then the next
418,_MESSENGER._,Loosened and followed them: till the voice came
419,_MESSENGER._,"To the very midst and huddle, where they pressed"
420,_MESSENGER._,"With upturned faces; then all heads went down,"
421,_MESSENGER._,And with a cry they fled.                                        161
422,_MESSENGER._,
423,_MESSENGER._,_Hu._                     Whither?
424,_MESSENGER._,
425,_MESSENGER._,_Man._                             I think
426,_MESSENGER._,"To the prison, my lord."
427,_MESSENGER._,
428,_MESSENGER._,_Enter a Soldier._
429,_MESSENGER._,

432,_SOLDIER._,_SOLDIER._
433,_SOLDIER._,
434,_SOLDIER._,The prisoner Palicio is escaped.
435,_SOLDIER._,"He killed his guards, and fled beyond pursuit."
436,_SOLDIER._,
437,_SOLDIER._,"_Ph._ (_to Liv._). Why, is not this the man you spoke of?"
438,_SOLDIER._,
439,_SOLDIER._,"_Liv._                                                    Ay,"
440,_SOLDIER._,That is the man.
441,_SOLDIER._,
442,_SOLDIER._,"_Hu._            Let the patrol be doubled for the night,"
443,_SOLDIER._,"And give not o’er the search. Alive or dead,"
444,_SOLDIER._,A hundred florins to whoever finds him.
445,_SOLDIER._,"Blasco, go see to it: he must not escape.                        169"

450,_SOLDIER._,"_Hu._ This same Palicio, duke, is the chief rebel:"
451,_SOLDIER._,"While he was caged, I could despise the rest."
452,_SOLDIER._,"But he’s a dangerous fellow; bred in the hills,"
453,_SOLDIER._,He is yet of noble blood and high descent:
454,_SOLDIER._,"A proud and lofty temper, that hath taken"
455,_SOLDIER._,"A graft of wildness, and shot forth afresh"
456,_SOLDIER._,"In base luxuriance. Tho’ yet unbearded,"
457,_SOLDIER._,"Bandits and exiles own him; and the people,"
458,_SOLDIER._,"Who hold such men in honour, can be drawn"
459,_SOLDIER._,But by his name to any enterprise.                               180
460,_SOLDIER._,’Tis he that with his bread-tax cry hath stirred
461,_SOLDIER._,"The commons to rebel, and be he ’scaped"
462,_SOLDIER._,"Clear, as ’tis thought, there will be more ado."
463,_SOLDIER._,"I’ll not so much as vouch, duke, for your safety,"
464,_SOLDIER._,If you should sleep in the palace.
465,_SOLDIER._,
466,_SOLDIER._,_Man._                             Let the duke
467,_SOLDIER._,Come to my house. What say you?
468,_SOLDIER._,
469,_SOLDIER._,"_Hu._                           What say you, Philip?"
470,_SOLDIER._,They would not seek you there.
471,_SOLDIER._,
472,_SOLDIER._,_Ph._                          If ’tis your wish.
473,_SOLDIER._,"I would not bring you trouble. (_To Fer._) Ferdinand,"

478,_SOLDIER._,We may be driven hence. The people’s cry

483,_SOLDIER._,"’Tis safer at our house, for pity’s sake"
484,_SOLDIER._,Spare your complexion and come back with us.
485,_SOLDIER._,
486,_SOLDIER._,"_Liv._ No doubt that sleep were sweeter, and all things else"
487,_SOLDIER._,"Beneath thy roof, lady: and came there danger,"
488,_SOLDIER._,That my sword might protect thee...
489,_SOLDIER._,
490,_SOLDIER._,"_Mar._                               The heavens shield us,"
491,_SOLDIER._,When we be left to that.
492,_SOLDIER._,
493,_SOLDIER._,_Liv._                   Didst thou not treat
494,_SOLDIER._,"All men with like contempt, I were much wronged:"
495,_SOLDIER._,But there’s none thou wilt praise.                               201
496,_SOLDIER._,
497,_SOLDIER._,"_Mar._                             Now, if I needed"
498,_SOLDIER._,"A man to look at, I would pass my time"
499,_SOLDIER._,"Searching for this Palicio. As for you,"
500,_SOLDIER._,"When you can lead the people, and cut your way"
501,_SOLDIER._,"Thro’ guards and prison walls, and get a price"
502,_SOLDIER._,Set on your head ... I’ll marry you.

504,_SOLDIER._,"_Man._                               Come, sister,"
505,_SOLDIER._,This goes too far.
506,_SOLDIER._,
507,_SOLDIER._,"_Mar._             Why, no. Be generous."
508,_SOLDIER._,"If I be wrong, what makes you ill at ease"
509,_SOLDIER._,"When this man’s free? Palicio is in prison,"
510,_SOLDIER._,"And all goes cheerfully; you sit to feast,                       210"
511,_SOLDIER._,"You have no care, a joke will raise a laugh."
512,_SOLDIER._,Palicio is escaped—hey! at that news
513,_SOLDIER._,"What blackness reigns! Forgive me, friends; I see"
514,_SOLDIER._,"This man’s your master, and I like him for it."
515,_SOLDIER._,"Bravery I love, and there’s no cause so poor"
516,_SOLDIER._,It cannot justify.
517,_SOLDIER._,
518,_SOLDIER._,"_Hu._              If we should take him,"
519,_SOLDIER._,I’ll send him to you stuffed.
520,_SOLDIER._,
521,_SOLDIER._,_Mar._                        Is that a speech
522,_SOLDIER._,One should forgive?
523,_SOLDIER._,
524,_SOLDIER._,_Man._              Enough. We take our leave.
525,_SOLDIER._,"We pass by a private way, duke."
526,_SOLDIER._,
527,_SOLDIER._,_Ph._                           I come with you.                 219

542,_SOLDIER._,
543,_SOLDIER._,_Hu._                             Fear not for me.

545,_SOLDIER._,[_Exit Constance._
546,_SOLDIER._,
547,_SOLDIER._,"Hark, Livio."
548,_SOLDIER._,I have learned somewhat from Philip: the Spanish court
549,_SOLDIER._,Is open to my enemies. My best hope
550,_SOLDIER._,If things go worse will be to sail for Spain
551,_SOLDIER._,And face them boldly there. ’Tis an extremity
552,_SOLDIER._,’Twere best to avoid: but since my hands are tied
553,_SOLDIER._,"I may be forced; and am so far resolved,"
554,_SOLDIER._,"That if Palicio now should raise the town,                       230"
555,_SOLDIER._,"And come to attack the palace, I shall fly."
556,_SOLDIER._,"I have had a way cut thro’ the chapel wall,"
557,_SOLDIER._,Whence by a covered passage I can reach
558,_SOLDIER._,"The harbour, where I keep a ship prepared."
559,_SOLDIER._,"Thee I must leave. But let this news be spread,"
560,_SOLDIER._,That Philip is with Manuel; it may serve
561,_SOLDIER._,To draw the people thither—his being here
562,_SOLDIER._,Would have impeded my escape. And first
563,_SOLDIER._,"We’ll go the rounds, and see that at all points"
564,_SOLDIER._,The watch is strong and wakeful. Come with me.

578,_PALICIO._,"Safe ... But this wound, the blood runs like a river:"
579,_PALICIO._,Unless they track me by it I am clear—so far.
580,_PALICIO._,A paltry stab. I’ll bind it round and tie it
581,_PALICIO._,"To stop the blood—so, so. Now, where to hide?"
582,_PALICIO._,For here is no protection; ’tis the house
583,_PALICIO._,Of the chief justiciary ... a doubtful ’scape
584,_PALICIO._,From prison here. Yet when I saw the wall
585,_PALICIO._,"’Twas home; then, oh, my God! this flip-flap gear"
586,_PALICIO._,"Shackling my knees—Over! ha, ha! the fools                       251"
587,_PALICIO._,Will never guess that leap. But I must hide:
588,_PALICIO._,"Slip out ere morn: or if not that, be bold,"
589,_PALICIO._,Give myself up to Manuel. Is that hope?
590,_PALICIO._,Manuel the just. ’Twere best reserve that hope
591,_PALICIO._,Till others fail. Hark!—steps. Where can I get?
592,_PALICIO._,Behind this curtain—so.                                    [_Hides._

632,_MARGARET._,"Yet ’twas ill said, and may have wounded Philip;"
633,_MARGARET._,Though he must wish us to assume there’s nothing

638,_MARGARET._,And not forbidding to what faults beset

640,_MARGARET._,By lower estimation; an open kindliness

651,_MARGARET._,
652,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                Brother, I am very sorry."
653,_MARGARET._,I thought ...
654,_MARGARET._,
655,_MARGARET._,_Man._        I do not blame your thought. I grant
656,_MARGARET._,These Spaniards are bad masters. First they wrecked
657,_MARGARET._,"This island to possess it; then the prize,"
658,_MARGARET._,"Which kindness might have much enriched, is stripped"
659,_MARGARET._,Even to the bone by cruelty and rapine.                          290
660,_MARGARET._,"Their viceroy too, this Hugo—a man who governs"
661,_MARGARET._,"But to be governor, and even at that"

682,_MARGARET._,"It matters not what happens, day by day"

686,_MARGARET._,"Withholding his consent just for the thought,"
687,_MARGARET._,"That while my happiness hangs on his nod,"
688,_MARGARET._,"I must be closer bound to serve his interest,"
689,_MARGARET._,"Now, when his credit totters. Doth he not know"

747,_MARGARET._,_Man._                    Art thou much hurt?                    330
748,_MARGARET._,
749,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._ A thrust in the arm, a petty prick, which yet"
750,_MARGARET._,Bleeds uncontrolledly.
751,_MARGARET._,
752,_MARGARET._,_Man._                 Undo it. It spurts.
753,_MARGARET._,"Hold here thy hand, while with thy handkerchief"
754,_MARGARET._,I bind thy arm.
755,_MARGARET._,
756,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._          Look you, ’tis lower down."
757,_MARGARET._,
758,_MARGARET._,"_Man._ Peace, man! ’Twill stay the blood to bind thee here."
759,_MARGARET._,Hast thou no other hurt?
760,_MARGARET._,
761,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._                   Nay, none but this."
762,_MARGARET._,"And see, ’tis staunched already. I must thank you,"
763,_MARGARET._,Tho’ here your help should end. Call in the hirelings;
764,_MARGARET._,They’ll not be far. I will go back with them.
765,_MARGARET._,And yet ’twere pity; for ’tis certain death:                     340
766,_MARGARET._,"I have killed three of them. Manuel, I pray you—"
767,_MARGARET._,"I pray you, Manuel, crush not all my hopes,"
768,_MARGARET._,"My just cause. Give me a sword and a man’s dress,"
769,_MARGARET._,And let me forth to try my fortune!
770,_MARGARET._,
771,_MARGARET._,_Man._                              Nay.
772,_MARGARET._,
773,_MARGARET._,_Pal._ Then if I take my dagger and venture out ...
774,_MARGARET._,
775,_MARGARET._,[_Takes it._
776,_MARGARET._,
777,_MARGARET._,I’ll yet escape. Deny me not this chance.
778,_MARGARET._,"See, I’ll not ask your leave, but only go.                  _Going._"
779,_MARGARET._,
780,_MARGARET._,"_Man._ Giovanni, stay. Thou hast done me a great wrong"
781,_MARGARET._,In flying here. Why didst thou choose my house?
782,_MARGARET._,
783,_MARGARET._,_Pal._ ’Twas as I fled for life: the hue-and-cry                 350
784,_MARGARET._,"Came gathering faster round me: being still clear,"
785,_MARGARET._,"And seeing your wall, it seemed my safety lay"
786,_MARGARET._,"In that leap, could I make it."
787,_MARGARET._,
788,_MARGARET._,"_Man._                         Thou’rt the last,"
789,_MARGARET._,And only offspring of a noble stock.
790,_MARGARET._,"The blood that I have staunched in thy veins,"
791,_MARGARET._,"Sprang from the heart of Sicily, and flows"
792,_MARGARET._,"Redder than mine, tho’ mine too once was mixed,"
793,_MARGARET._,"And not unworthily, with thine, and now"
794,_MARGARET._,From my great grandsire’s marriage both our bloods
795,_MARGARET._,"Are even as one, and thy blood on my hands                       360"
796,_MARGARET._,"Is mine, and mine within my veins is thine."
797,_MARGARET._,"I cannot send thee to thy death, Giovanni;"
798,_MARGARET._,"I may not shelter thee from justice: See,"
799,_MARGARET._,Thou hast done me a grievous wrong.
800,_MARGARET._,
801,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                              Yet hide me awhile.
802,_MARGARET._,This house may be my prison.
803,_MARGARET._,
804,_MARGARET._,_Man._                       Thou hast this hope:
805,_MARGARET._,The king being dead ...
806,_MARGARET._,
807,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                  Is’t true that Pedro is dead?
808,_MARGARET._,
809,_MARGARET._,"_Man._ Ay, true enough."
810,_MARGARET._,
811,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                  Then are you free. I am safe.
812,_MARGARET._,
813,_MARGARET._,[_Puts dagger in his bosom._
814,_MARGARET._,
815,_MARGARET._,"_Man._ I say this is thy hope. The king being dead,"
816,_MARGARET._,Such offices as hold under the crown                             370
817,_MARGARET._,Need confirmation. Now I do not say
818,_MARGARET._,"Allegiance lapses; but, if I be quick"
819,_MARGARET._,"To guess the new king’s will, that he will change"
820,_MARGARET._,"Our viceroy—which I doubt not,—I may be bold"
821,_MARGARET._,Now to withhold my duties from a servant
822,_MARGARET._,"Discredited, contending that they hang"
823,_MARGARET._,"Upon my judgment, for my deeds to give"
824,_MARGARET._,"After-account. See, ’tis a subtle point"
825,_MARGARET._,"I strain for thee, rather than hurt the claim"
826,_MARGARET._,Of kinship. Thou shalt be my prisoner                            380
827,_MARGARET._,For these few days. By chance I have a room
828,_MARGARET._,"Fit for thy lodging: there I’ll shew thee now,"
829,_MARGARET._,"And thence thou must not stir. I’ll bring thee food,"
830,_MARGARET._,"Look to thy wants, and try to cure thy wound."
831,_MARGARET._,Thou on thy part must lie as still as one
832,_MARGARET._,"That hushes for his life. What, man; thou’rt faint"
833,_MARGARET._,"For loss of blood, and strain? Cannot you stand?"
834,_MARGARET._,"Stand up, or I must carry you. Indeed,"
835,_MARGARET._,"Carry him I must ... see, now, where be my keys?"
836,_MARGARET._,
837,_MARGARET._,"[_Going, carrying Palicio._"

850,_MARGARET._,
851,_MARGARET._,"Sweet, happy Constance, tell me why thou sighest.                390"
852,_MARGARET._,What can’st thou lack?
853,_MARGARET._,
854,_CONSTANCE._,_CONSTANCE._
855,_CONSTANCE._,
856,_CONSTANCE._,I am not very happy.
857,_CONSTANCE._,
858,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._ Not happy, thou? Woe for the world! I thought"
859,_CONSTANCE._,"Love was God’s perfect recipe, to drowse"
860,_CONSTANCE._,All mortal stings. Yet sainted marriage hath
861,_CONSTANCE._,One threat—the loss of liberty: is’t that?
862,_CONSTANCE._,It well may fright. To have been a girl with me
863,_CONSTANCE._,"So long, and make at last the outrageous stroke,"
864,_CONSTANCE._,"And live as do our aunts! Were’t not my brother,"
865,_CONSTANCE._,I’d kill the man.
866,_CONSTANCE._,
867,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._            Margaret!
868,_CONSTANCE._,
869,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                      Well mayst thou sigh:
870,_CONSTANCE._,I can sigh for thee.
871,_CONSTANCE._,
872,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._               I should love to hear thee.                 400
873,_CONSTANCE._,"Thou owest me sighs, for mine were thoughts of thee."
874,_CONSTANCE._,
875,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ Because I love not? Hast thou forgot already
876,_CONSTANCE._,Life may be tolerable for a woman
877,_CONSTANCE._,Without thy joy?
878,_CONSTANCE._,
879,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._           You treat poor Livio
880,_CONSTANCE._,"Unkindly, Margaret."
881,_CONSTANCE._,
882,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._              Now, if that’s the grief,"
883,_CONSTANCE._,We have threshed it out before.
884,_CONSTANCE._,
885,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._                          I shall not spare you,"
886,_CONSTANCE._,Till you are kinder.
887,_CONSTANCE._,
888,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._               Yet if I were kinder,"
889,_CONSTANCE._,"And he should build a hope upon that kindness,"
890,_CONSTANCE._,Until it proved unkinder than unkindness?
891,_CONSTANCE._,
892,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._ He loves you well.
893,_CONSTANCE._,
894,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                    No better than the others;
895,_CONSTANCE._,"Than Ventimiglia loves, or Chiaramonte,                          411"
896,_CONSTANCE._,"Good Michael Rosso, or the impudent Blasco,"
897,_CONSTANCE._,Or my new courtier Ferdinand.
898,_CONSTANCE._,
899,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                        He loves
900,_CONSTANCE._,With all his heart. Life is as tedious to him
901,_CONSTANCE._,"As to the dark and dusty wheel, which jerks"
902,_CONSTANCE._,"Behind the dial-face, until he see you;"
903,_CONSTANCE._,When for his joy you give him but disdain.
904,_CONSTANCE._,
905,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ Thou didst not tell him thou wouldst speak for him?
906,_CONSTANCE._,
907,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._ Why not?
908,_CONSTANCE._,
909,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._          Now I, Constance, have something fresh:"
910,_CONSTANCE._,A mystery.
911,_CONSTANCE._,
912,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._     A mystery?
913,_CONSTANCE._,
914,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._                Yes, a mystery.                            420"
915,_CONSTANCE._,Guess what it is.
916,_CONSTANCE._,
917,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._            How should I guess?
918,_CONSTANCE._,
919,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._                                Indeed,"
920,_CONSTANCE._,Guessing would never wind it.
921,_CONSTANCE._,
922,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._                        Then, prithee, tell me."
923,_CONSTANCE._,
924,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._ I died to tell thee ere thou camest, and now"
925,_CONSTANCE._,"I grudge it sadly. Yet, for the fresh mount"
926,_CONSTANCE._,"’Twill give thy thoughts, I’ll tell. ’Twas yesternight,"
927,_CONSTANCE._,Just on the stroke of one ...
928,_CONSTANCE._,
929,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                        ’Tis not a ghost?
930,_CONSTANCE._,
931,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ If after all ’twere but a ghost!
932,_CONSTANCE._,
933,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._                                  Come, tell me."
934,_CONSTANCE._,
935,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ Thou wilt not breathe a word?
936,_CONSTANCE._,
937,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._                               No, not a word."
938,_CONSTANCE._,
939,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ Thou know’st the casement of my bedroom looks
940,_CONSTANCE._,"Across the court. There as I stood last night,                   430"
941,_CONSTANCE._,"Watching the moon awhile, ere I shut out"
942,_CONSTANCE._,"The sleepless splendour from my dreams, I heard"
943,_CONSTANCE._,A heavy step pass down the gallery.
944,_CONSTANCE._,"’Tis Manuel, I thought, who goes to lie"
945,_CONSTANCE._,"In the little chamber at the back,—for Philip"
946,_CONSTANCE._,"Had his;—but, for some strangeness in the step"
947,_CONSTANCE._,"Pricked my attention, and to content my thought,"
948,_CONSTANCE._,"I lent my ear to the sound, until it reached"
949,_CONSTANCE._,"The door at the end: there, standing by the window"
950,_CONSTANCE._,"I saw him plain: ’twas he, but in his arms                       440"
951,_CONSTANCE._,"A woman, fainting as I thought, or dead."
952,_CONSTANCE._,"Her arms hung loose, and o’er his shoulder thrown"
953,_CONSTANCE._,Her head fell back.
954,_CONSTANCE._,
955,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._              A woman! art thou sure?
956,_CONSTANCE._,
957,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._ He could not carry a ghost. Besides, this morning"
958,_CONSTANCE._,"I watched him: he took thither meat and drink,"
959,_CONSTANCE._,"And locked the door, and strictly bade the servants"
960,_CONSTANCE._,They should not enter.
961,_CONSTANCE._,
962,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                 Hast thou questioned him?
963,_CONSTANCE._,
964,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ I have not so much as let him speak with me.
965,_CONSTANCE._,"He might forbid me: and, O my curiosity,"
966,_CONSTANCE._,I must know more.
967,_CONSTANCE._,
968,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._            What dost thou think to learn?                 450
969,_CONSTANCE._,
970,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ I have neither guess nor hope; I lay awake
971,_CONSTANCE._,"An hour, and thought of fifty things, not one"
972,_CONSTANCE._,Of any likelihood. In all romance
973,_CONSTANCE._,No lady in distress ere came at midnight
974,_CONSTANCE._,To the house of the chief justice. I could wish
975,_CONSTANCE._,This beauteous maiden were a young princess
976,_CONSTANCE._,Fled o’er the seas disguised.
977,_CONSTANCE._,
978,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                        Then thou couldst see
979,_CONSTANCE._,What she was like.
980,_CONSTANCE._,
981,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._             Why, no,—how could I see?"
982,_CONSTANCE._,I only saw that she was dark.
983,_CONSTANCE._,
984,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                        Thou saidst
985,_CONSTANCE._,That she was beautiful.
986,_CONSTANCE._,
987,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                  Of course she is young                   460
988,_CONSTANCE._,"And beautiful. Why,—you are not jealous, Constance?"
989,_CONSTANCE._,
990,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._ Not jealous, no."
991,_CONSTANCE._,
992,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                  And the only pity of it
993,_CONSTANCE._,Is that she’ll prove in the end a poor relation
994,_CONSTANCE._,"Fall’n to our care, or some more hapless girl"
995,_CONSTANCE._,Left on the doorstep dying.
996,_CONSTANCE._,
997,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._                      In such case,"
998,_CONSTANCE._,What were the need of secrecy?
999,_CONSTANCE._,
1000,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                         I wish
1001,_CONSTANCE._,I had never told thee aught. Why shouldst thou fancy
1002,_CONSTANCE._,Impossibilities?
1003,_CONSTANCE._,
1004,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._           What is impossible?
1005,_CONSTANCE._,
1006,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._ I fear now that the sight of thy old love,"
1007,_CONSTANCE._,"Philip the false, hath turned thy happier trust.                 470"
1008,_CONSTANCE._,Thou’rt changed.
1009,_CONSTANCE._,
1010,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._           Nay, nay: I am not: and yet ’tis true"
1011,_CONSTANCE._,His coming is my trouble.                                   [_Weeps._
1012,_CONSTANCE._,
1013,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._                    Forgive me, sweetest."
1014,_CONSTANCE._,
1015,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._ Margaret, you know I have none at all but you"
1016,_CONSTANCE._,To unfold my heart to: only you can tell
1017,_CONSTANCE._,What I must feel at his return: you know
1018,_CONSTANCE._,"How far I loved, how much I was deceived."
1019,_CONSTANCE._,"His oaths of faith you heard from me, and shared"
1020,_CONSTANCE._,"The joy of my delusion: and at last,"
1021,_CONSTANCE._,"When he deserted me, you made your heart"
1022,_CONSTANCE._,"The prison of my sorrows: you exhorted,—                         480"
1023,_CONSTANCE._,"O, you advised me well,—Be sure, you said,"
1024,_CONSTANCE._,Love that so breaks cannot be trusted more.
1025,_CONSTANCE._,You bade me cast it off like an ill dream.
1026,_CONSTANCE._,You found what life he led: how he profaned
1027,_CONSTANCE._,His honourable passion in the play
1028,_CONSTANCE._,Of errant gallantries. All that sad time
1029,_CONSTANCE._,"I leaned on you, and ’twas your friendship gave"
1030,_CONSTANCE._,The occasions whence my love with Manuel sprung.
1031,_CONSTANCE._,"You led me still, you gave me confidence;"
1032,_CONSTANCE._,"Your comfort turned to joy, Manuel was mine.                     490"
1033,_CONSTANCE._,When suddenly on some mysterious cause
1034,_CONSTANCE._,He holds aloof: my joy is bid await.
1035,_CONSTANCE._,"O, Margaret, if you understood love’s joy,"
1036,_CONSTANCE._,"How closely ’tis inwoven with fear to lose,"
1037,_CONSTANCE._,"You would not wonder that I tremble, seeing"
1038,_CONSTANCE._,"This shadow blot my sunshine, that my fear"
1039,_CONSTANCE._,Discolours every circumstance. To me
1040,_CONSTANCE._,The common course of things on which men count
1041,_CONSTANCE._,"Is the only miracle, all chances else"
1042,_CONSTANCE._,"As they are feared are likely. O, do not blame me."
1043,_CONSTANCE._,Philip is like an evil spirit beside me                          501
1044,_CONSTANCE._,That stands to smile on what I dread to think.
1045,_CONSTANCE._,
1046,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ Philip being false can give no cause to doubt
1047,_CONSTANCE._,Of Manuel’s faith.
1048,_CONSTANCE._,
1049,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._             I doubt him not: and yet
1050,_CONSTANCE._,"If I speak of my brother you only laugh,"
1051,_CONSTANCE._,But if you speak of yours ...
1052,_CONSTANCE._,
1053,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._                        Round, round again."
1054,_CONSTANCE._,Betwixt our brothers grant some difference.
1055,_CONSTANCE._,"Thy Livio is a boy of slender parts,"
1056,_CONSTANCE._,Led by his passions. Manuel is a man
1057,_CONSTANCE._,Austere and stern; he is above suspicion.                        510
1058,_CONSTANCE._,
1059,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._ I do not doubt his truth, but find such sternness"
1060,_CONSTANCE._,Unkind to love. My brother’s love for you
1061,_CONSTANCE._,Is simple: Manuel’s love hath some reserve;
1062,_CONSTANCE._,"A veil, behind which, since I have never seen,"
1063,_CONSTANCE._,I have dreamed or feared a terror lay: ofttimes
1064,_CONSTANCE._,"When I have been with him, a pleasant hour"
1065,_CONSTANCE._,"Has ended suddenly, as if his spirit"
1066,_CONSTANCE._,"Was angered, and withdrew: then in his eyes"
1067,_CONSTANCE._,"Is nothing left but barren contemplation,"
1068,_CONSTANCE._,To which I am an object as another;                              520
1069,_CONSTANCE._,"Until he sighs, as conscious of the change."
1070,_CONSTANCE._,The disappointment of our marriage brings
1071,_CONSTANCE._,Scarce a regret to him: I heard him speak
1072,_CONSTANCE._,"Late to my father of it, as ’twere a thing"
1073,_CONSTANCE._,He held indifferently. There is some secret
1074,_CONSTANCE._,Which I would know: maybe this is a clue.
1075,_CONSTANCE._,
1076,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ What is the clue?
1077,_CONSTANCE._,
1078,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                   This lady.
1079,_CONSTANCE._,
1080,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._                              O, thou’rt sick."
1081,_CONSTANCE._,"But I can cure thee, wilt thou do my bidding."
1082,_CONSTANCE._,
1083,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._ What would you bid?
1084,_CONSTANCE._,
1085,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._                     Give rein to jealousy,"
1086,_CONSTANCE._,"Ay, spur it on to falling. Fear the worst,                       530"
1087,_CONSTANCE._,Believe the worst. Thou shalt suspect my brother;
1088,_CONSTANCE._,"He trifles, loves this lady: choose your tale:"
1089,_CONSTANCE._,Thou wilt not doubt again.
1090,_CONSTANCE._,
1091,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                     I do not doubt him.
1092,_CONSTANCE._,"Nay, I will bid him tell me all."
1093,_CONSTANCE._,
1094,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                           And so
1095,_CONSTANCE._,"Betray thy doubt to him. Be wiser, madam!"
1096,_CONSTANCE._,Look to thy cure: indulge thy jealousy:
1097,_CONSTANCE._,"To which end I encourage it. Indeed,"
1098,_CONSTANCE._,"I am come to think there’s cause, and thy suspicion"
1099,_CONSTANCE._,Hath much enhanced my mystery. Go thou home:
1100,_CONSTANCE._,There make thyself unhappy. I meanwhile                          540
1101,_CONSTANCE._,"Will root this out, and since I am housekeeper"
1102,_CONSTANCE._,I can go where I will.
1103,_CONSTANCE._,
1104,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._                 I pray thee, Margaret ..."
1105,_CONSTANCE._,
1106,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ I must be jealous where my brother is wronged.
1107,_CONSTANCE._,"Thou art the accuser, and the evidence"
1108,_CONSTANCE._,Tells now for thee: ’tis my part to acquit us.
1109,_CONSTANCE._,Hinder me not.
1110,_CONSTANCE._,
1111,_CONSTANCE._,
1112,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._         When wilt thou know?
1113,_CONSTANCE._,
1114,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                              Maybe
1115,_CONSTANCE._,’Tis as thou fearest.
1116,_CONSTANCE._,
1117,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                Wilt thou mock me so?
1118,_CONSTANCE._,
1119,_CONSTANCE._,"_Mar._ I bid thee go. Be sure I’ll come to thee,"
1120,_CONSTANCE._,Or send thee word.
1121,_CONSTANCE._,
1122,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._             But when?
1123,_CONSTANCE._,
1124,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                       I make no promise.
1125,_CONSTANCE._,"I cannot pity thee, and till thou goest                          550"
1126,_CONSTANCE._,I can do nothing.
1127,_CONSTANCE._,
1128,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._            Promise me to send.
1129,_CONSTANCE._,
1130,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._ I have promised that. Farewell!
1131,_CONSTANCE._,
1132,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                                 To-day?
1133,_CONSTANCE._,
1134,_CONSTANCE._,_Mar._                                         To-day.
1135,_CONSTANCE._,"Trust me, I go at once.                                   [_Exeunt._"

1142,_BLASCO._,_BLASCO._
1143,_BLASCO._,
1144,_BLASCO._,I have sucked this Ferdinand. Duke Philip bears
1145,_BLASCO._,"Secret despatches sealed, not to be broken"
1146,_BLASCO._,Save on emergency; from which I gather
1147,_BLASCO._,"That if emergency arise, this Philip"
1148,_BLASCO._,Will be our viceroy. Palicio being escaped
1149,_BLASCO._,"Must make the emergency.—Then, where am I?"
1150,_BLASCO._,"Packed off to Spain with Hugo’s broken service,                  560"
1151,_BLASCO._,To answer his impeachment. ’Tis high time
1152,_BLASCO._,"I cast by these old friends, such as they are,"
1153,_BLASCO._,"And turn my face to the rising sun, this Philip."
1154,_BLASCO._,I see the way too. Manuel’s love for Constance
1155,_BLASCO._,Hath roused again his former love for her
1156,_BLASCO._,To a burning jealousy; if I feed that
1157,_BLASCO._,"I win his ear, and make my foe his foe."
1158,_BLASCO._,"As for Palicio, should he hold back"
1159,_BLASCO._,"I have a way with him, and can contrive"
1160,_BLASCO._,"He shall seize Hugo, or himself be seized,                       570"
1161,_BLASCO._,"As may suit best. The mischief set on foot,"
1162,_BLASCO._,Philip must break his seals; and I come in
1163,_BLASCO._,"With him as friendly to the people’s rights,"
1164,_BLASCO._,"And trusted servant of the crown. By heav’n,"
1165,_BLASCO._,"I shall deserve their credit. See, here he comes."
1166,_BLASCO._,
1167,_BLASCO._,_Enter Philip._
1168,_BLASCO._,
1169,_BLASCO._,Good morrow to your grace.
1170,_BLASCO._,
1171,_PHILIP._,_PHILIP._
1172,_PHILIP._,
1173,_PHILIP._,"Good morrow, Blasco."
1174,_PHILIP._,
1175,_PHILIP._,_Bl._ I served thy father well.
1176,_PHILIP._,
1177,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._                           I know it, Blasco."
1178,_PHILIP._,What of it now?
1179,_PHILIP._,
1180,_PHILIP._,_Bl._           I do not urge my service
1181,_PHILIP._,Looking for recompense; I do not ask
1182,_PHILIP._,So much as that your grace remember me                           580
1183,_PHILIP._,"At court, to mention my forgotten name"
1184,_PHILIP._,"In the new king’s ear; as, When I was in Sicily"
1185,_PHILIP._,"I saw old Blasco; nay, ’twas for good-will"
1186,_PHILIP._,"I served, and now ’tis that I want a master"
1187,_PHILIP._,Which bids me speak. If but your grace could find me
1188,_PHILIP._,"Employment worth my wits, I would serve well."
1189,_PHILIP._,
1190,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ I’ll think of it.
1191,_PHILIP._,
1192,_PHILIP._,_Bl._                   Let your grace know my life
1193,_PHILIP._,Spent in this court should make my loyalty
1194,_PHILIP._,More than a counsellor. In this rebellion
1195,_PHILIP._,"I know where Hugo fails, where Manuel leans;                     590"
1196,_PHILIP._,"Could blow upon the flame or snuff it out,"
1197,_PHILIP._,Could bring you to the leaders.
1198,_PHILIP._,
1199,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._                           Honest Blasco,"
1200,_PHILIP._,Thou know’st the world.
1201,_PHILIP._,
1202,_PHILIP._,_Bl._                   I know that one who comes
1203,_PHILIP._,"To make peace in a quarrel that he knows not,"
1204,_PHILIP._,Needs other knowledge than he is like to get
1205,_PHILIP._,From either party. The strings of policy
1206,_PHILIP._,Are coiled in private chambers; if your grace
1207,_PHILIP._,Would pull at these ...
1208,_PHILIP._,
1209,_PHILIP._,_Ph._                   True. If thou serve me thus
1210,_PHILIP._,I’ll take instruction.
1211,_PHILIP._,
1212,_PHILIP._,_Bl._                  Let your grace now prove me
1213,_PHILIP._,In any question.
1214,_PHILIP._,
1215,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._            This, then. We in Spain                         600"
1216,_PHILIP._,"Supposed that your revolt stood on two legs,"
1217,_PHILIP._,Over-taxation and the hate of Hugo;
1218,_PHILIP._,And had its claim for justice countenanced
1219,_PHILIP._,"By Manuel’s voice: but coming here, I find"
1220,_PHILIP._,That he and Hugo’s daughter are betrothed.
1221,_PHILIP._,"Now here’s a private matter, which, I take it,"
1222,_PHILIP._,"Involves the public. Say, doth Manuel play"
1223,_PHILIP._,"His policy on Hugo, or hath Hugo"
1224,_PHILIP._,Trumped up a match with Manuel to support
1225,_PHILIP._,His failing credit?
1226,_PHILIP._,
1227,_PHILIP._,"_Bl._               They are not betrothed, your grace."
1228,_PHILIP._,What passes between lovers is unknown:                           611
1229,_PHILIP._,"But this is sure, Hugo withholds consent,"
1230,_PHILIP._,And doth so to win Manuel to his side.
1231,_PHILIP._,
1232,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ Doth not that win him?
1233,_PHILIP._,
1234,_PHILIP._,_Bl._                        Nay.
1235,_PHILIP._,
1236,_PHILIP._,_Ph._                             Then I conclude
1237,_PHILIP._,He loves not.
1238,_PHILIP._,
1239,_PHILIP._,"_Bl._         Nay, indeed; it gives me pain"
1240,_PHILIP._,To witness his indifference; for the lady
1241,_PHILIP._,Deserves the best.
1242,_PHILIP._,
1243,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._              Stay, count. Remember"
1244,_PHILIP._,In what has passed that word may well blame me.
1245,_PHILIP._,
1246,_PHILIP._,_Bl._ I hearken not to idle tales. Your grace
1247,_PHILIP._,May be punctilious; but in Manuel’s instance                     620
1248,_PHILIP._,There’s no excuse.
1249,_PHILIP._,
1250,_PHILIP._,_Ph._              I care not what men say.
1251,_PHILIP._,And now it hurts me more to hear thee blame
1252,_PHILIP._,"Another for the fault I stumbled in,"
1253,_PHILIP._,Than if ’twas said of me. I need thy knowledge.
1254,_PHILIP._,"Look, thou canst serve me; and I let none serve"
1255,_PHILIP._,For nothing. Take my purse (_gives it_); thou mayst have need
1256,_PHILIP._,To spend so much for me.
1257,_PHILIP._,
1258,_PHILIP._,_Bl._                    I thank your grace.
1259,_PHILIP._,"I shun no obligation, and I am poor."
1260,_PHILIP._,
1261,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._ True, all men are so. Come now to my chamber,"
1262,_PHILIP._,Where we may talk in private.
1263,_PHILIP._,
1264,_PHILIP._,_Bl._ (_aside_).              ’Tis well begun.                   630

1276,_PALICIO._,I seem to have lived a life in these few days;
1277,_PALICIO._,"To have died, and waked in no less strange a place,"
1278,_PALICIO._,Than where I think departed spirits will fly
1279,_PALICIO._,In doom of death and unendurable silence
1280,_PALICIO._,After their day of doing. Oh! ’tis strange
1281,_PALICIO._,What just the shedding a few drops of blood
1282,_PALICIO._,"Will bring about—to loosen a handkerchief,"
1283,_PALICIO._,And on her undiscoverable journey
1284,_PALICIO._,"The soul sets forth. Nay, but to bleed so far"
1285,_PALICIO._,"As I have done, breeds fancies much akin                         640"
1286,_PALICIO._,To death; else would my spirit more revolt
1287,_PALICIO._,’Gainst this enforcèd quiet and idleness:
1288,_PALICIO._,This blocking of my life just on the stir
1289,_PALICIO._,"And hurry of hope, when all my operations"
1290,_PALICIO._,"Pressed to success. I am surely very weak,"
1291,_PALICIO._,"That I can lie and fret not, when I hear"
1292,_PALICIO._,"The distant cries, passing from street to street,"
1293,_PALICIO._,Which tell how prompt and ripe my people were
1294,_PALICIO._,For this their lost occasion. (_Knocking heard._) Some one knocks.

1322,_PALICIO._,’Tis well I came. May I draw back the curtains?

1339,_PALICIO._,And move like this. O wonder! Wherefore comes she?
1340,_PALICIO._,And how to keep her but a moment longer
1341,_PALICIO._,From the discovery? and how to tell her?                         670

1443,_PALICIO._,I had entered but that morning in the town;
1444,_PALICIO._,"I was not known to them, nor did the hirelings"
1445,_PALICIO._,"Look on my face. They led me straight to prison,"
1446,_PALICIO._,"Thrust me in a cell so dank and dark and small,"

1452,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ Or let me starve; or else some gentle mercy;
1453,_PALICIO._,"Gouged my live eyeballs out, or lopped my hands."
1454,_PALICIO._,
1455,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ How couldst thou ’scape?
1456,_PALICIO._,
1457,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                          Now thou wilt see our people
1458,_PALICIO._,Have their account. The second night my gaoler                   721
1459,_PALICIO._,Brought in a woman with a deed to sign.
1460,_PALICIO._,"I knew my hope, and to her feigned reproach"
1461,_PALICIO._,Answered in anger back: but when she bade
1462,_PALICIO._,"I took the deed, and felt beneath the paper"
1463,_PALICIO._,"A dagger’s edge. That was my key to heaven,"
1464,_PALICIO._,"Could I strike silently. To make occasion,"
1465,_PALICIO._,"I thrust her from me with an oath: she fell,"
1466,_PALICIO._,"As well she knew, against the foe, who stooping,"
1467,_PALICIO._,Stooped to his death and fell without a groan.                   730
1468,_PALICIO._,"Then quick she doffed her gown for my disguise,"
1469,_PALICIO._,Telling me in few words how this was planned
1470,_PALICIO._,By friends who had seen me taken: they had not means
1471,_PALICIO._,"For present rescue, but discovering soon"
1472,_PALICIO._,"Who had betrayed me, used his cursed name"
1473,_PALICIO._,"With the governour of the prison, to admit"
1474,_PALICIO._,"Her, his pretended wife, that she might claim"
1475,_PALICIO._,Settlement of some debt before I died.
1476,_PALICIO._,"So was it paid. Then we went forth together,"
1477,_PALICIO._,"I in her woman’s garments, following her,                        740"
1478,_PALICIO._,Who wore the habit of the soldier slain:
1479,_PALICIO._,"And she went clear: but I, for some suspicion"
1480,_PALICIO._,"Was questioned at the gate. Of those two men,"
1481,_PALICIO._,"One I slew straight: the other, as I struck,"
1482,_PALICIO._,"Thrust thro’ my arm, yet not so hurtfully"
1483,_PALICIO._,But that he fell for it too. But thence alarm
1484,_PALICIO._,"Was given: I fled pursued, and gat me clear,"
1485,_PALICIO._,Leaping your garden wall.
1486,_PALICIO._,
1487,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                    Who was the woman?
1488,_PALICIO._,
1489,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ One of our people.
1490,_PALICIO._,
1491,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                    May her name be told?
1492,_PALICIO._,
1493,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ I never heard it.
1494,_PALICIO._,
1495,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                   Yet she knew thee well.                 750
1496,_PALICIO._,I had been proud to have done her deed. I think
1497,_PALICIO._,There are not many men as brave as she.
1498,_PALICIO._,
1499,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ O, lady, there are many, women and men,"
1500,_PALICIO._,Sworn to risk life in our good cause.
1501,_PALICIO._,
1502,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                                Alas,"
1503,_PALICIO._,That such fine courage should be so misled!
1504,_PALICIO._,
1505,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ Misled? how, if I lead it?"
1506,_PALICIO._,
1507,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                            I had forgot.
1508,_PALICIO._,"Pardon me, sir. It was my brother’s word."
1509,_PALICIO._,
1510,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ Ay, ’tis his word. And yet I honour Manuel."
1511,_PALICIO._,Were’t not for him there scarce would be a man
1512,_PALICIO._,Of all our people who would reverence                            760
1513,_PALICIO._,"Justice and order, and those other names"
1514,_PALICIO._,Of social welfare. ’Tis to him alone
1515,_PALICIO._,We have looked to give us these. But if he stand
1516,_PALICIO._,Where he can take our tyrants by the arm
1517,_PALICIO._,"And show them baits of righteousness, and lead them"
1518,_PALICIO._,"Where they should go, shall we who lie beneath"
1519,_PALICIO._,"Forbear to sting the laggard heel of justice,"
1520,_PALICIO._,Or think it crime to obstruct the path of wrong?
1521,_PALICIO._,I blame not him that from his higher place
1522,_PALICIO._,He finds offence in outcry and disorder:                         770
1523,_PALICIO._,To such as without loss or shame outride
1524,_PALICIO._,The storms of shifting fortune this is easy.
1525,_PALICIO._,
1526,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ What dost thou but exasperate ill-will?
1527,_PALICIO._,
1528,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ Already our bread has been untaxed two days.
1529,_PALICIO._,
1530,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ And may be two days more.
1531,_PALICIO._,
1532,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                           I have better hope,"
1533,_PALICIO._,Or had: for if I had once provoked the Spaniard
1534,_PALICIO._,"To set his troops against us, all the nobles,"
1535,_PALICIO._,"Who now retired hold neutral parliament,"
1536,_PALICIO._,"Would then have joined the people, and compelled"
1537,_PALICIO._,The justice of our claim by force of arms.                       780
1538,_PALICIO._,
1539,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._ All, say’st thou?"
1540,_PALICIO._,
1541,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                   All save one or two, who are bought"
1542,_PALICIO._,With Hugo’s money.
1543,_PALICIO._,
1544,_PALICIO._,_Mar._             Say’st thou bought?
1545,_PALICIO._,
1546,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                                 O lady,"
1547,_PALICIO._,"Unto their great dishonour they are bought,"
1548,_PALICIO._,"With sweated pence wrung from the labourer,"
1549,_PALICIO._,Ere he can buy a loaf to feed his children
1550,_PALICIO._,Out of the corn his hands have sown and reaped.
1551,_PALICIO._,Is not this shame?
1552,_PALICIO._,
1553,_PALICIO._,_Mar._             ’Tis shame.
1554,_PALICIO._,
1555,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                         And shall Palicio
1556,_PALICIO._,"See this thing done, because he hath not office,"
1557,_PALICIO._,"Or those few paltry florins, which might turn"
1558,_PALICIO._,The scale for poor Sicilians?
1559,_PALICIO._,
1560,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                        Ah, indeed,                        790"
1561,_PALICIO._,"I knew, I felt that thou wert right; and now"
1562,_PALICIO._,I see it: I never blamed thee.
1563,_PALICIO._,
1564,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                         No, nor Manuel"
1565,_PALICIO._,"Blames me at heart, tho’ he forbid my means."
1566,_PALICIO._,"Think, had I kept my old estate, and he"
1567,_PALICIO._,"Had fallen as I, should I not do as he,"
1568,_PALICIO._,And he as I am doing?
1569,_PALICIO._,
1570,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                Oh, I think"
1571,_PALICIO._,’Tis nobler to be poor. To share the suffering
1572,_PALICIO._,Of them we pity ranks above redress.
1573,_PALICIO._,I am come to envy thee.
1574,_PALICIO._,
1575,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                  And certain it is,"
1576,_PALICIO._,They who have least to lose will venture most.                   800
1577,_PALICIO._,
1578,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ Yet those that have can give. What’s the best hope
1579,_PALICIO._,Of this rebellion?
1580,_PALICIO._,
1581,_PALICIO._,_Pal._             We would make thy brother
1582,_PALICIO._,Viceroy in place of Hugo.
1583,_PALICIO._,
1584,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                    Will that be?
1585,_PALICIO._,
1586,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ Here I know nothing, save that nought is done."
1587,_PALICIO._,
1588,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ Is there no leader then but thee?
1589,_PALICIO._,
1590,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                                   The people
1591,_PALICIO._,Are limbs without a head.
1592,_PALICIO._,
1593,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                    When will thy wound
1594,_PALICIO._,Be healed?
1595,_PALICIO._,
1596,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ Thy brother says that any surgeon
1597,_PALICIO._,"Could mend it quickly, but that his own skill,"
1598,_PALICIO._,"Which knows the injury, was never practised"
1599,_PALICIO._,"To find out and to bind the wounded vessel,                      810"
1600,_PALICIO._,"Which, being unhelped of art, may run to death."
1601,_PALICIO._,
1602,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ To death! And hath he sent no surgeon?
1603,_PALICIO._,
1604,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                                        Nay,"
1605,_PALICIO._,That were the greater risk for him and me.
1606,_PALICIO._,
1607,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._ Not so, if he could cure thee. I shall bring one.  [_As going._"
1608,_PALICIO._,
1609,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ It cannot be.
1610,_PALICIO._,
1611,_PALICIO._,_Mar._               Thou mayst believe there’s none
1612,_PALICIO._,In all Palermo but myself could do it:
1613,_PALICIO._,Yet can I do it.
1614,_PALICIO._,
1615,_PALICIO._,_Pal._           Speak with Manuel first.
1616,_PALICIO._,
1617,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ Oh! I shall tell him all. He will consent.
1618,_PALICIO._,’Tis well I came. No surgeon for thee! Ah!
1619,_PALICIO._,I go.
1620,_PALICIO._,
1621,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ Thou wilt return?
1622,_PALICIO._,
1623,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                   Be sure, be sure.                       820"
1624,_PALICIO._,And with the leech.                                         [_Exit._

1642,_MANUEL._,"What now, my mischief-maker?"
1643,_MANUEL._,
1644,_MANUEL._,_Mar._ I have seen Palicio.
1645,_MANUEL._,
1646,_MANUEL._,_Man._                      Hey! ’twas thy evil genius
1647,_MANUEL._,Led thee that way.
1648,_MANUEL._,
1649,_MANUEL._,"_Mar._             I thinking him a woman,"
1650,_MANUEL._,Offered some service: whereupon he told me
1651,_MANUEL._,"Who he was, all his story, and of his wound."
1652,_MANUEL._,
1653,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ I am sorry; I should have warned thee, for the knowledge"
1654,_MANUEL._,Makes thee so far accomplice; and I know not
1655,_MANUEL._,How ’twill be taken when ’tis known.
1656,_MANUEL._,
1657,_MANUEL._,"_Mar._                               O, brother,                 830"
1658,_MANUEL._,Thou hast done nobly.
1659,_MANUEL._,
1660,_MANUEL._,_Man._                I will tell to thee
1661,_MANUEL._,My motives.
1662,_MANUEL._,
1663,_MANUEL._,"_Mar._      Nay, I need no motives."
1664,_MANUEL._,

1666,_MANUEL._,"Palicio’s life is forfeit, for he has killed"
1667,_MANUEL._,Three of his guards: but to the dangerous deed
1668,_MANUEL._,"He had provocation, such as I should hold"
1669,_MANUEL._,Clears him of crime: wherefore I take upon me
1670,_MANUEL._,"To force a loan of Justice while she sleeps,"
1671,_MANUEL._,"For fear a thief should rob her: to this, moreover,"
1672,_MANUEL._,"The claim of kinship binds me,—nay, be patient,"
1673,_MANUEL._,And hear me out.—Already our disorders                           840
1674,_MANUEL._,Have been reported at the Spanish court;
1675,_MANUEL._,The enquiry set on foot will much endamage
1676,_MANUEL._,Hugo’s good name: I doubt not we shall have
1677,_MANUEL._,"Another viceroy, and the revolution"
1678,_MANUEL._,Will justify the movers.
1679,_MANUEL._,
1680,_MANUEL._,"_Mar._                   Oh! all that,"
1681,_MANUEL._,"Be as it may, will never cure his wound."
1682,_MANUEL._,He needs a surgeon: we must find a surgeon.
1683,_MANUEL._,
1684,_MANUEL._,_Man._ No: he must lie concealed till I procure
1685,_MANUEL._,His pardon. His discovery now were death.
1686,_MANUEL._,
1687,_MANUEL._,_Mar._ But if I bring one secretly?
1688,_MANUEL._,
1689,_MANUEL._,_Man._                              How secretly?                850
1690,_MANUEL._,Better cry down the streets the man is here:
1691,_MANUEL._,That might escape attention.
1692,_MANUEL._,
1693,_MANUEL._,_Mar._                       I know a man.
1694,_MANUEL._,Have I not sometimes shewn thee certain sonnets
1695,_MANUEL._,Writ in Sicilian speech?
1696,_MANUEL._,
1697,_MANUEL._,_Man._                   Eh! Michael Rosso?
1698,_MANUEL._,
1699,_MANUEL._,_Mar._ ’Tis he. I think he’d love to do my bidding
1700,_MANUEL._,"In a more dangerous matter. Give me leave,"
1701,_MANUEL._,I’ll bring him here to-night.
1702,_MANUEL._,
1703,_MANUEL._,"_Man._                        I had thought of him,"
1704,_MANUEL._,But shrank from taxing his good-will. And yet—
1705,_MANUEL._,(_Aside._) For his own sake ’twere kind ... and Margaret asks it ...
1706,_MANUEL._,"Secrets, they say, discover sympathies.—                         860"
1707,_MANUEL._,"(_Aloud._) Ay, ’tis well thought of."
1708,_MANUEL._,
1709,_MANUEL._,_Mar._                               I can answer for him.
1710,_MANUEL._,
1711,_MANUEL._,_Man._ I see. Yet there’s no cause why he should know.
1712,_MANUEL._,Escort him blindfold hither; let Palicio
1713,_MANUEL._,Have his face covered. Let him ask no questions:
1714,_MANUEL._,And when ’tis done convey him blindfold back.
1715,_MANUEL._,’Twere best he should not know.
1716,_MANUEL._,
1717,_MANUEL._,"_Mar._                          O, brother, I thank thee."
1718,_MANUEL._,
1719,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ Why, girl, thou’rt crazed."
1720,_MANUEL._,
1721,_MANUEL._,_Mar._                            May I not go at once?
1722,_MANUEL._,
1723,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ Nay, wait till dusk; and see, take here my seal,"
1724,_MANUEL._,Since thou must go alone: ’twill be thy freedom
1725,_MANUEL._,From any questionings of any people.                             870
1726,_MANUEL._,"Use all precautions, and impose on Rosso"
1727,_MANUEL._,Sacredest secrecy: ’tis thou and he
1728,_MANUEL._,Must carry it thro’. Be careful.
1729,_MANUEL._,
1730,_MANUEL._,_Mar._                           I will put on
1731,_MANUEL._,"Some common clothing, and disguise my face."
1732,_MANUEL._,I thank thee.                                              [_Exit._
1733,_MANUEL._,
1734,_MANUEL._,"_Man._        The girl’s in love. Now, bravo Rosso!"
1735,_MANUEL._,I wish thee well. There’s not a purer spirit
1736,_MANUEL._,"Fleshed in all Sicily; nay, nor a man"
1737,_MANUEL._,"I’d sooner call brother. Why, ’twas my choice,"
1738,_MANUEL._,Long urged in vain. That chanceth in an hour
1739,_MANUEL._,"Which comes not in nine years. ’Tis very true,                   880"
1740,_MANUEL._,"Fancy resents all judgment, and another’s"
1741,_MANUEL._,"Will often kill it quite. Now, when I looked"
1742,_MANUEL._,"Rather for anything than my own wish,—heigh-ho!"
1743,_MANUEL._,’Tis I that stand in the way. I must discourage it.

1775,_PHILIP._,
1776,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ These papers are conviction. Blasco is right:
1777,_PHILIP._,He loves not. That is clear; for he would ruin                   901
1778,_PHILIP._,Her father. Then again my rivalry

1816,_PHILIP._,
1817,_PHILIP._,_Con._ How in that name?

1822,_PHILIP._,
1823,_PHILIP._,_Ph._                                    Oh! ’tis true ...       920
1824,_PHILIP._,"Reproach me not, Constance: my evil life"
1825,_PHILIP._,I have quite renounced. I used it but to learn
1826,_PHILIP._,The wisdom of that other. I come back
1827,_PHILIP._,From folly and idleness and evil days.
1828,_PHILIP._,"Whate’er hath been, Constance, I have not left thee:"
1829,_PHILIP._,"There hath been nothing near thee, nothing like thee,"
1830,_PHILIP._,Nothing but thee: and I return to find thee
1831,_PHILIP._,More beautiful than ever ...
1832,_PHILIP._,
1833,_PHILIP._,"_Con._                       Pray you, sir,"
1834,_PHILIP._,Remember.
1835,_PHILIP._,
1836,_PHILIP._,_Ph._     Let me speak.
1837,_PHILIP._,
1838,_PHILIP._,"_Con._                  When thou didst ask to speak,"
1839,_PHILIP._,"I looked for that one word, which thou in honour"
1840,_PHILIP._,"Wert, to amend thy silence, bound to speak.                      931"
1841,_PHILIP._,’Twas in thy power to salve thy breach of faith
1842,_PHILIP._,With full and free renouncement. Thine earlier ill
1843,_PHILIP._,"I had then forgiven: for if thou art not changed,"
1844,_PHILIP._,"Philip, I am: then I was ignorant—"
1845,_PHILIP._,Maybe we both were—both mistook; but thou
1846,_PHILIP._,"Didst add an injury, and to-day thou addest"
1847,_PHILIP._,"Another worse. Knowing me now betrothed,"
1848,_PHILIP._,How canst thou offer to renew thy love?
1849,_PHILIP._,
1850,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._ O, Constance, Manuel doth not, cannot, love thee           940"
1851,_PHILIP._,As I.
1852,_PHILIP._,
1853,_PHILIP._,_Con._ I pray he doth not.

1855,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._                      Hear me, Constance!"

1857,_PHILIP._,"_Con._ Nay, sir; no more.                                   [_Exit._"
1858,_PHILIP._,
1859,_PHILIP._,_Ph._                     My passion hath aroused
1860,_PHILIP._,Passion in her; and that must work for me.
1861,_PHILIP._,Is it likely such a temper would sit down
1862,_PHILIP._,And eat cold fare at Manuel’s feast of reason?
1863,_PHILIP._,"She will be mine. Ay, tho’ she said betrothed—"
1864,_PHILIP._,Once ’twas to me. So now to see her father;
1865,_PHILIP._,He’s but a market where I rule with ease.
1866,_PHILIP._,"The papers! By heav’n, I had left them lying!            [_Stoops._"
1867,_PHILIP._,Ha!
1868,_PHILIP._,Blood! blood upon the floor! I have knelt in blood—
1869,_PHILIP._,"Here were an omen, were I superstitious.—                        951"
1870,_PHILIP._,And scarcely dry. This city hath fallen accurst.
1871,_PHILIP._,There is nothing spoke of ... Ah! but what if this
1872,_PHILIP._,Should be the track they seek? Palicio
1873,_PHILIP._,Took shelter here! Impossible. Even Blasco
1874,_PHILIP._,Thought not so ill of Manuel. Yet the other
1875,_PHILIP._,"Under the wall, and this within the house ..."
1876,_PHILIP._,They tally. Peace! I will go search the garden.

1992,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Go thou and tell my men that I will come.                       1010
1993,_SQUARCIALUPU._,To-morrow morning let them look to find me
1994,_SQUARCIALUPU._,At Monreale. If I come not then

2003,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Sq._ (_whistles at window and is answered_). I have thy promise.

2009,_SQUARCIALUPU._,I might have found a surgeon—now when she comes
2010,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"I will say nothing. Nothing ... yet, that’s no hope;"
2011,_SQUARCIALUPU._,For seeing her I must love her: and if I fail
2012,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"To win her wholly, I must lose my soul"

2029,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"The meanest favour, till he dreamed one night"
2030,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"That he was blind, and she, in pity of him,"

2032,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"But left him suddenly; whereat he awoke,"

2062,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"In attitude of striking at another,—"
2063,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Thrust with—a sword.—Stir not, ’tis nearly done.—"
2064,_SQUARCIALUPU._,But I withdrew my arm ere he his weapon.—

2088,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._                     True.—What’s thy name?

2095,_SQUARCIALUPU._,This is Palicio. Guard now what you have learned
2096,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"As closely, I pray, as if we had freely told it."
2097,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2098,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Ros._ Not to thee, lady, though in this and all"

2117,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._                                               Why, what is this?"
2118,_SQUARCIALUPU._,You know your way: there’s nothing now to hide.
2119,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2120,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Ros._ Didst thou not bargain with me to lead me back?
2121,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2122,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ But there’s no need.
2123,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2124,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Ros._                      Yet will I claim my fee.
2125,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Where is thy hand?
2126,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2127,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._             Sir, you but trifle."
2128,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2129,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Ros._                                  And thou
2130,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Refusest me in a trifle? Then I will dare (_unbandaging_)
2131,_SQUARCIALUPU._,To raise my terms. If I may kiss thy hand                       1091
2132,_SQUARCIALUPU._,I’ll be content.
2133,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2134,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._           ’Tis I, sir, should kiss yours."
2135,_SQUARCIALUPU._,’Tis that hath earned the homage: and I’ll be
2136,_SQUARCIALUPU._,kind.
2137,_SQUARCIALUPU._,That hath done well; and thus I kiss it. (_Kisses Rosso’s
2138,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"hand._) Now,"
2139,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Go, go in peace: thou’rt paid.                [_Making him go out._"
2140,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2141,_SQUARCIALUPU._,[_Exit Rosso._
2142,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2143,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._ (_sitting_).            Why didst thou that?
2144,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2145,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ He loves me.
2146,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2147,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._              Wouldst thou be as kind to me,"
2148,_SQUARCIALUPU._,If I should love thee?
2149,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2150,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._                 But he sends me sonnets.
2151,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2152,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._ I could write sonnets.
2153,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2154,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._                        Ah, but his are writ"
2155,_SQUARCIALUPU._,In pure Sicilian.
2156,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2157,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._            ’Tis my proper tongue.
2158,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2159,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._ I have kept my promise, sir, and now must leave.         1100"
2160,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Your wound is healed.
2161,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2162,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                I fear I scarce can thank thee,"
2163,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"If ’tis thy word to go. Or, if thou stayest"
2164,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"But to cure wounds,—I have another wound"
2165,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"I shewed thee not, which hath a deeper seat:"
2166,_SQUARCIALUPU._,This hand may cure it.
2167,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2168,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._                 Nay, what mean you, sir?"
2169,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2170,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._ Margaret, I love thee. There, thou hast it all."
2171,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Thou hast stolen my soul. I thought—my pride, my hope—"
2172,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"O, I thought wrong—’tis nothing. All I have done,"
2173,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Or would do, I cast aside: I love thee only."
2174,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2175,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ Giovanni.                                                1010
2176,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2177,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._           O, ’tis true, there’s nothing noble,"
2178,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Beautiful, sacred, dear, familiar to me,"
2179,_SQUARCIALUPU._,I hold now at a straw’s worth: body and soul
2180,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"I am thine, Margaret, I am thine. O, answer me!"
2181,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2182,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._ Giovanni, ’tis so strange. ’Tis best I go."
2183,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2184,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._ Thou didst kiss Rosso’s hand.
2185,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2186,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._                               For love of thee.
2187,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Didst thou not guess?
2188,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2189,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                O, then, my dearest, kiss me"
2190,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Now for myself. Can it be true thou lovest me?
2191,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2192,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ Alas! ’tis learned too quickly.
2193,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2194,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                                 Can I think it,"
2195,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Spite of my savage life, my outlawry,"
2196,_SQUARCIALUPU._,My poverty?
2197,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2198,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._      O, what are these?"
2199,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2200,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                         Indeed,                          1120"
2201,_SQUARCIALUPU._,My blood is noble.
2202,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2203,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._             These are not the checks
2204,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Or lures of love. Nay, what is noble blood?"
2205,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"What were’t to be a lion, and to fly"
2206,_SQUARCIALUPU._,The hunter like a hare? And if man shew
2207,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Less fearless fierce and hungry for the right
2208,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Than doth a beast for food, what is his title"
2209,_SQUARCIALUPU._,To be God’s image worth? That best nobility
2210,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Hath no more claim.
2211,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2212,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._              But canst thou share my life?
2213,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2214,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ I am restless for it.
2215,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2216,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._                       Leave thy rank? thy wealth?
2217,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2218,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ I have lived too long that counterfeit of life.
2219,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"I’ll strive like thee: something I’ll do, like thee,"
2220,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"To lessen misery. Nay, if man’s curse                           1132"
2221,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Hang in necessity, I have the heart"
2222,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"To combat that, and find if in some part"
2223,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Fate be not vulnerable.
2224,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2225,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                  O joy, my dearest:"
2226,_SQUARCIALUPU._,I wronged thee ages by a moment’s thought
2227,_SQUARCIALUPU._,That thou wouldst shrink ... Then is our marriage fixed?
2228,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2229,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ There’s none can hinder it.
2230,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2231,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                             O, blessed joy!"
2232,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Yet how can I be sure, love, that thou knowest,"
2233,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Finding the word so easy, what a mountain                       1140"
2234,_SQUARCIALUPU._,There lies to lift? Pledging to me and mine
2235,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Thy heart this hour, a hundred thousand stings"
2236,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Will plague thee from this moment, to drive thee back."
2237,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2238,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._ Try me, Giovanni."
2239,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2240,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                   Wilt thou aid me, love,"
2241,_SQUARCIALUPU._,To fly to-night? By morning I may meet
2242,_SQUARCIALUPU._,My men at San Martino: all my schemes
2243,_SQUARCIALUPU._,May yet be saved.
2244,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2245,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._            Ah! wilt thou go, Giovanni?"
2246,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Thou’rt yet too weak.
2247,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2248,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._                My presence, not my strength,"
2249,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Is needed.
2250,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2251,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ Alas! I fear.
2252,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2253,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._               What, Margaret, dost thou fear?"
2254,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2255,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ Only for thee. Yet go; I can be with thee
2256,_SQUARCIALUPU._,By noon. My brother has a little house                          1151
2257,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"At Monreale, where I am used to stay"
2258,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"When the wish takes me. There I’ll go to-morrow,"
2259,_SQUARCIALUPU._,And thence can visit thee. Thou didst not mean
2260,_SQUARCIALUPU._,I should not come? I shall not hinder thee.
2261,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2262,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._ Nay, nay."
2263,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2264,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._           I’ll let thee from the house to-night,"
2265,_SQUARCIALUPU._,And give thee money which will aid thee well.
2266,_SQUARCIALUPU._,My brother need know nothing. I can make
2267,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"The journey thither in an hour, and choose"
2268,_SQUARCIALUPU._,My time to beg his grace.
2269,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2270,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._                    What do I owe thee!                   1160
2271,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Freedom, and life, and love,—thy love ... O, Margaret,"
2272,_SQUARCIALUPU._,What I shall do will pay thee.
2273,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2274,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._                         I must leave:
2275,_SQUARCIALUPU._,For Manuel else will question of my stay.
2276,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2277,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._ My treasure lost so soon!
2278,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2279,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._                           I go to save
2280,_SQUARCIALUPU._,What we have won. Farewell.
2281,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2282,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._                      Say at what hour
2283,_SQUARCIALUPU._,I may go hence; and how.
2284,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2285,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._                   At dead of night:
2286,_SQUARCIALUPU._,’Tis safest then.
2287,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2288,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._            And wilt thou come thyself?
2289,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2290,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._ When the church bell with double stroke hath tolled
2291,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"The death-knell of to-morrow’s second hour,"
2292,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"While its last jar yet shelters in the ear,                     1170"
2293,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Listen: and at thy door when thou shalt catch
2294,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"A small and wakeful noise, such as is made"
2295,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"By the sharp teeth of an unventurous mouse,"
2296,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Scraping his scanty feast when all is still,"
2297,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Come forth. Thou’lt meet my hand, and at the gate"
2298,_SQUARCIALUPU._,I’ll give thee what I have. Tied in thy bundle
2299,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Will be a letter shewing thee the place
2300,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Where thou must send me tidings. Now, farewell."
2301,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2302,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._ Yet not farewell.
2303,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2304,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._                   To-night I shall not see thee:
2305,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Nor must thou speak. So, till to-morrow’s sun                   1180"
2306,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Lasts our farewell.
2307,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2308,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._              Then with to-morrow, Margaret,"
2309,_SQUARCIALUPU._,My life begins.
2310,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2311,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Mar._          O, ’tis the greater joy"
2312,_SQUARCIALUPU._,For me than thee.
2313,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2314,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"_Pal._            Ay, for the giver ever"
2315,_SQUARCIALUPU._,"Hath the best share. And thus I kiss thee, love."
2316,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Farewell.
2317,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2318,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._    Be ready.
2319,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2320,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Pal._              Trust me.
2321,_SQUARCIALUPU._,
2322,_SQUARCIALUPU._,_Mar._                        And take thy dagger.
2323,_SQUARCIALUPU._,Farewell.                                                  [_Going._

2340,_MANUEL._,Some explanation written: there was none.                       1190

2345,_MARGARET._,What promise made he?
2346,_MARGARET._,
2347,_MARGARET._,_Man._                  None was asked. The knowledge
2348,_MARGARET._,Of duty were enough to bind a man
2349,_MARGARET._,"Far less obliged. And then ’tis thankless, Margaret."
2350,_MARGARET._,"Twice have we saved his life: first I, then thou:"
2351,_MARGARET._,"And while we sleep he flies. I blame myself,"
2352,_MARGARET._,I should have pledged his word.

2354,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                          Hadst thou so done,"
2355,_MARGARET._,He would have stayed.

2357,_MARGARET._,_Man._                I know not. Now he is gone ...
2358,_MARGARET._,Go set his room as if he had never been.
2359,_MARGARET._,We must forget the matter. I have summons                       1200

2368,_MARGARET._,
2369,_MARGARET._,_Man._                   What calls you there?

2371,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                                         A visit.
2372,_MARGARET._,"I’ll take Lucia, and can ride Rosamund."

2374,_MARGARET._,"_Man._ Nay, nay, I would not have it. Thou wilt meet"
2375,_MARGARET._,"With Rosso’s people, maybe Rosso himself;"
2376,_MARGARET._,And he might misinterpret ... and I think
2377,_MARGARET._,"So soon after your game of blindman’s buff,"
2378,_MARGARET._,That since thou canst not love him ...
2379,_MARGARET._,
2380,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                                 Manuel, I promise—"

2383,_MARGARET._,Remember ...

2385,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ Why, I’ll promise ..."
2386,_MARGARET._,
2387,_MARGARET._,"_Man._                       Nay, I bid."

2417,_LUCIA._,
2418,_LUCIA._,_Lu._ Consider.

2441,_LUCIA._,
2442,_LUCIA._,"_Mar._ Forgive, she saith. Forgive me rather, oh heaven!        1230"
2443,_LUCIA._,The sourness of my spirit hitherto:
2444,_LUCIA._,Yet now forgive me not if I dare tamper
2445,_LUCIA._,"With this intrinsic passion. O joy, my joy!"
2446,_LUCIA._,This beauteous world is mine:
2447,_LUCIA._,All Sicily is mine:
2448,_LUCIA._,"This morning mine. I saw the sun, my slave,"
2449,_LUCIA._,Poising on high his shorn and naked orb
2450,_LUCIA._,"For my delight. He there had stayed for me,"
2451,_LUCIA._,Had he not read it in my heart’s delight
2452,_LUCIA._,"I bade him on. The birds at dawn sang to me,                    1240"
2453,_LUCIA._,Crying ’Is life not sweet? O is’t not sweet?’
2454,_LUCIA._,"I looked upon the sea; there was not one,"
2455,_LUCIA._,"Of all his multitudinous waves, not one,"
2456,_LUCIA._,That with its watery drift at raking speed
2457,_LUCIA._,Told not my special joy. O happy lovers
2458,_LUCIA._,"In all the world, praise God with me: his angels"
2459,_LUCIA._,"Envy us, seeing we are his favourites."
2460,_LUCIA._,What else could grant such joy? Now on my journey
2461,_LUCIA._,"Must I set forth, to be a brigand’s wife ..."
2462,_LUCIA._,"That’s but the outward of it, and looks strange:"
2463,_LUCIA._,"For, oh, the heart of it is a fire of passion                   1251"
2464,_LUCIA._,"To lick up trifling life. Away, such dainty stuff:"
2465,_LUCIA._,Let me stand forth myself.—Yet ere I go
2466,_LUCIA._,I must send Constance word. To whom to trust
2467,_LUCIA._,"My letter? Ah, Philip ..."

2475,_PHILIP._,"_Mar._ Good morning, duke: thou goest to the palace?"
2476,_PHILIP._,
2477,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ Ay.
2478,_PHILIP._,
2479,_PHILIP._,"_Mar._ May I ask thee, then, to bear this letter"
2480,_PHILIP._,To Constance? I’d not trust it willingly
2481,_PHILIP._,Where it might wander.
2482,_PHILIP._,
2483,_PHILIP._,_Ph._                  ’Twill pass from my hands

2488,_PHILIP._,
2489,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._ I’ll tell her so. I pray the change restore thee,—"
2490,_PHILIP._,And soon. Indeed thou look’st not well. Farewell.
2491,_PHILIP._,
2492,_PHILIP._,_Mar._ Farewell. (_Aside._) Look I then ill? I never felt
2493,_PHILIP._,So light and keen in spirit.                                [_Exit._
2494,_PHILIP._,
2495,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._ (_solus_). This fits in, too. She is sent to Monreale,"
2496,_PHILIP._,Lest she should make discovery. ’Tis thus
2497,_PHILIP._,"I join the threads. Palicio climbed the wall,"
2498,_PHILIP._,Came hither thro’ the garden: here he stayed
2499,_PHILIP._,And bound his wound. So far the track. There has been
2500,_PHILIP._,At least no care to hide it; and now he lies                    1271
2501,_PHILIP._,In the room across the courtyard: wherefore else
2502,_PHILIP._,"Drawn curtains, and the lamp, which yesterday"
2503,_PHILIP._,"Burnt, as I saw, in the afternoon? All credit"
2504,_PHILIP._,"To the king’s commissioner. Yet must I dissemble,"
2505,_PHILIP._,And not appear in the matter. ’Tis incredible
2506,_PHILIP._,Of Manuel. What will he allege? He is gone
2507,_PHILIP._,"To the palace now: thither must I, and face him."

2785,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ ’Tis recklessness throughout. See, thou art wounded"

2797,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._                   Nay, fear not: there’s a traitor"
2798,_MARGARET._,In the enemy’s camp; from whom I’ll have such tidings
2799,_MARGARET._,As will ensure success.
2800,_MARGARET._,
2801,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                  Who is it?
2802,_MARGARET._,
2803,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                             Blasco.
2804,_MARGARET._,
2805,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ Blasco!
2806,_MARGARET._,
2807,_MARGARET._,_Pal._         He hath your money; and for that price
2808,_MARGARET._,Will tell how Hugo may be best surprised.                       1430
2809,_MARGARET._,"That is my venture, Margaret ... If it fail ..."
2810,_MARGARET._,
2811,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ Thou wilt be slain.
2812,_MARGARET._,
2813,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._                     Nay, I may still escape."
2814,_MARGARET._,
2815,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ And then thou’lt come?
2816,_MARGARET._,
2817,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                        I will.
2818,_MARGARET._,
2819,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                                Promise but that:
2820,_MARGARET._,"That if this venture fail, and thou escape,"
2821,_MARGARET._,Thou wilt not risk again.
2822,_MARGARET._,
2823,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._                    Ay, if I fail."
2824,_MARGARET._,
2825,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                                   Promise.
2826,_MARGARET._,
2827,_MARGARET._,_Pal._ I promise.
2828,_MARGARET._,
2829,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ Thou wilt lose nothing, for my brother alone"
2830,_MARGARET._,"Can do much more than thou with these base men,"
2831,_MARGARET._,Who stain the cause. One favour more.
2832,_MARGARET._,
2833,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                                What is it?
2834,_MARGARET._,
2835,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ ’Tis that this evening, love, be spent together."
2836,_MARGARET._,
2837,_MARGARET._,_Pal._ I mean it should. To-night our fellows meet
2838,_MARGARET._,"In various rendezvous, as you may see                           1442"
2839,_MARGARET._,Upon the paper. There are ten in all
2840,_MARGARET._,"They will not need my presence till to-morrow,"
2841,_MARGARET._,"When the bands join at sundown. O, Margaret:"
2842,_MARGARET._,I knew that thou wouldst come.
2843,_MARGARET._,
2844,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                         I think, Giovanni,"
2845,_MARGARET._,Thou shouldst have met me first thyself: thy men
2846,_MARGARET._,Are rough.
2847,_MARGARET._,
2848,_MARGARET._,_Pal._     Was any rude?
2849,_MARGARET._,
2850,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                   Nay, ’twas well meant,"
2851,_MARGARET._,But sounded strangely.
2852,_MARGARET._,
2853,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                 Say but who it was.
2854,_MARGARET._,
2855,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ No, ’tis forgiven.                                       1450"
2856,_MARGARET._,
2857,_MARGARET._,_Pal._ (_going_).         Kiss me.
2858,_MARGARET._,
2859,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                             Ah, now, Giovanni,"
2860,_MARGARET._,Where wilt thou go?
2861,_MARGARET._,
2862,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._              But for one hour, my dearest,"
2863,_MARGARET._,I must be absent. Then shall I be yours
2864,_MARGARET._,For all the day.
2865,_MARGARET._,
2866,_MARGARET._,_Mar._           Farewell. And prithee send
2867,_MARGARET._,Lucia. I will await thee.
2868,_MARGARET._,
2869,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                    Farewell.                         [_Exit._
2870,_MARGARET._,
2871,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                              I have his promise,"
2872,_MARGARET._,If this scheme fail. ’Tis mine to make it fail.
2873,_MARGARET._,"O, ’tis too dangerous: to trust so far"
2874,_MARGARET._,"That dollar-ballasted Iscariot,"
2875,_MARGARET._,The weather-trimming Blasco.—The paper! the list!
2876,_MARGARET._,I’ll have their names. Where can I write them? Ah!
2877,_MARGARET._,My prayer-book. I will send them straight to Hugo.
2878,_MARGARET._,"Poor Constance! Burn the palace! Ay, and thee,"
2879,_MARGARET._,"For aught they care. Now, who comes first? Bendettu"
2880,_MARGARET._,Jacupu ... and your place?—within the cloister                  1463
2881,_MARGARET._,"Of Santo Spirito. Next, Squarcialupu ..."
2882,_MARGARET._,"Why, that’s the ruffian who would like a dozen"
2883,_MARGARET._,Wives such as I. He’ll find one were too many.
2884,_MARGARET._,"Go you to prison, sir, and cool your thoughts."
2885,_MARGARET._,You burn the palace!—Messer Vincentiu
2886,_MARGARET._,Lazaru ... at his peltry shed at Baido.
2887,_MARGARET._,Now there’s two pages of them: the little prayers
2888,_MARGARET._,Will hardly shrive them ... here’s one I cannot read.
2889,_MARGARET._,"B-o-n-o-Bononio, now I have him.                                1472"
2890,_MARGARET._,Why who could trust such men? Set them in power
2891,_MARGARET._,"But for a day ... say this next villain here,"
2892,_MARGARET._,"Fardello ... he’s a murderer—ay, for him"
2893,_MARGARET._,"I write his death, maybe: but for the rest"
2894,_MARGARET._,I’ll take such care that Manuel’s voice shall ease
2895,_MARGARET._,Their accusation. Now I have them all.
2896,_MARGARET._,"Lucia! Ho, Lucia!"
2897,_MARGARET._,
2898,_MARGARET._,_Enter Lucia._
2899,_MARGARET._,
2900,_MARGARET._,"See, take this book:"
2901,_MARGARET._,"Return straight to Palermo: find some friend,                   1480"
2902,_MARGARET._,Whom thou canst trust: commit it to her hands;
2903,_MARGARET._,"Tell her to give it secretly to Livio,"
2904,_MARGARET._,Bidding him read what is writ down in the margins;
2905,_MARGARET._,"And say ’twas given to her by one she knew not,"
2906,_MARGARET._,And with that message. All our happiness
2907,_MARGARET._,Is staked on this. Begone. Haste for thy life.

2910,_LUCIA._,
2911,_LUCIA._,Alas! what’s this?
2912,_LUCIA._,
2913,_LUCIA._,"_Mar._               Why, have I frighted thee?"
2914,_LUCIA._,Be brave: I tell thee on this single thread
2915,_LUCIA._,My life is hanging.
2916,_LUCIA._,
2917,_LUCIA._,"_Lu._               Trust me, lady, I’d risk"
2918,_LUCIA._,Ten lives for that.
2919,_LUCIA._,
2920,_LUCIA._,_Mar._              Hide it. I trust thee. Go.                  1490
2921,_LUCIA._,"I have played a bold stroke here: but if it prosper,"
2922,_LUCIA._,"For Constance, and Giovanni, and myself,"
2923,_LUCIA._,’Tis not ill done.                                        [_Exeunt._

2934,_HUGO._,
2935,_CONSTANCE._,_CONSTANCE._
2936,_CONSTANCE._,
2937,_CONSTANCE._,"I pray thee, father, hear me."
2938,_CONSTANCE._,
2939,_CONSTANCE._,_Hu._                           I have heard thee.
2940,_CONSTANCE._,Thou tellest me nought but what I know. The duke
2941,_CONSTANCE._,Hath been with me: his purpose to renew
2942,_CONSTANCE._,His suit hath my support. ’Tis very honourable—
2943,_CONSTANCE._,It shall be welcome. Though thy words to him                    1500
2944,_CONSTANCE._,"Betrayed reluctance, that makes yet no reason"
2945,_CONSTANCE._,To shun him. He will presently be here:
2946,_CONSTANCE._,Stay and receive him.
2947,_CONSTANCE._,
2948,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._                O, if I do not dream,"
2949,_CONSTANCE._,Heaven help me now!
2950,_CONSTANCE._,
2951,_CONSTANCE._,"_Hu._               Constance, I pray, be sober."
2952,_CONSTANCE._,I am sorry for thee: but what seems thy grief
2953,_CONSTANCE._,"Will be thy comfort, when thou learn’st the cause"
2954,_CONSTANCE._,Which presses me to urge it.
2955,_CONSTANCE._,
2956,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                       What lies behind?
2957,_CONSTANCE._,What misery? Say!
2958,_CONSTANCE._,
2959,_CONSTANCE._,"_Hu._             Manuel, whom late we trusted,"
2960,_CONSTANCE._,Hath turned against me. He hath joined the rebels.
2961,_CONSTANCE._,
2962,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._ Who dares to slander him?                                1510
2963,_CONSTANCE._,
2964,_CONSTANCE._,_Hu._                            Fact makes no room
2965,_CONSTANCE._,For slander. The devil himself could not invent
2966,_CONSTANCE._,A tale to blacken him. First to the court
2967,_CONSTANCE._,"He hath writ of me in secret, in the sense"
2968,_CONSTANCE._,That I have stirred the king’s men to rebellion
2969,_CONSTANCE._,By my misrule; and all the while at home
2970,_CONSTANCE._,"He feeds the mischief, and most treacherously"
2971,_CONSTANCE._,"Favours the rebels, so to magnify"
2972,_CONSTANCE._,The blame on me he charges.
2973,_CONSTANCE._,
2974,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                      The crime’s too great.
2975,_CONSTANCE._,If this be all I breathe again. The time                        1519
2976,_CONSTANCE._,When thou wilt prove this ’twill away like smoke.
2977,_CONSTANCE._,"Not till ’tis proved question our marriage, father."
2978,_CONSTANCE._,
2979,_CONSTANCE._,"_Hu._ The question now with him is not of marriage,"
2980,_CONSTANCE._,But of his head.
2981,_CONSTANCE._,
2982,_CONSTANCE._,"_Con._           Shame, shame! if these be words,"
2983,_CONSTANCE._,What is their sense?
2984,_CONSTANCE._,
2985,_CONSTANCE._,"_Hu._                To-morrow, or to-day,"
2986,_CONSTANCE._,I shall have proof.
2987,_CONSTANCE._,
2988,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._              I knew ’twas all unproven.
2989,_CONSTANCE._,"Who brought this lie, and propped it with the promise"
2990,_CONSTANCE._,To make it true?
2991,_CONSTANCE._,
2992,_CONSTANCE._,"_Hu._            Go, girl, I hear the duke."
2993,_CONSTANCE._,He must not see thee thus.
2994,_CONSTANCE._,
2995,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                     So far is well.
2996,_CONSTANCE._,I gladly go.—Dear father!
2997,_CONSTANCE._,
2998,_CONSTANCE._,_Hu._                      Go take thy grief
2999,_CONSTANCE._,Where thou canst comfort it. This Manuel                        1530
3000,_CONSTANCE._,"Hath not deceived thee more than me, and me"
3001,_CONSTANCE._,Would have more grossly wronged.
3002,_CONSTANCE._,
3003,_CONSTANCE._,_Con._                           Alas! alas!                [_Exit._
3004,_CONSTANCE._,
3005,_CONSTANCE._,"_Hu._ The proof will be to search his house, and so"
3006,_CONSTANCE._,Both knaves are caught at once. Now to that end
3007,_CONSTANCE._,"Lest he get wind of it I have bid him hither,"
3008,_CONSTANCE._,And shall detain him till ’tis done.
3009,_CONSTANCE._,
3010,_CONSTANCE._,_Enter Philip._
3011,_CONSTANCE._,
3012,_CONSTANCE._,"Your grace,"

3014,_CONSTANCE._,
3015,_PHILIP._,_PHILIP._
3016,_PHILIP._,
3017,_PHILIP._,’Tis well. I bring conviction.
3018,_PHILIP._,Palicio lies in Manuel’s house. His room
3019,_PHILIP._,"Is locked and darkened: save for that, and orders"
3020,_PHILIP._,"That none shall enter, there is no precaution.                  1540"
3021,_PHILIP._,
3022,_PHILIP._,_Hu._ The abominable Pharisee!
3023,_PHILIP._,
3024,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ Now Margaret hath been hurried from the house
3025,_PHILIP._,On plea of health: I bear a letter from her
3026,_PHILIP._,To Constance.
3027,_PHILIP._,
3028,_PHILIP._,_Hu._         Give’t me.
3029,_PHILIP._,
3030,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._                    Pardon, your excellence;"
3031,_PHILIP._,I promised I would see it in Constance’s hands.
3032,_PHILIP._,
3033,_PHILIP._,_Hu._ My hands are hers: a daughter cannot read
3034,_PHILIP._,"Letters her father may not. Nay, the more"
3035,_PHILIP._,"Such right’s resented, more’s the need to use it.—"
3036,_PHILIP._,And from a traitor’s house!
3037,_PHILIP._,
3038,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._ (_giving_).           Your privilege, sir,"
3039,_PHILIP._,Invades my honour.                                              1550
3040,_PHILIP._,
3041,_PHILIP._,"_Hu._              Tut, tut, tut, ’tis mine:            [_Takes it._"
3042,_PHILIP._,Be not so squeamish.                                       [_Reads._
3043,_PHILIP._,
3044,_PHILIP._,_I can write all’s well.
3045,_PHILIP._,"Yet, as thou lovest Manuel, breathe no word"
3046,_PHILIP._,Of aught I saw. I go from home to-day;
3047,_PHILIP._,"Will see thee when returned._—Why, this is nothing."
3048,_PHILIP._,
3049,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ Taken alone ’twere nothing; but there’s nothing
3050,_PHILIP._,Could better fit our knowledge; nay it adds
3051,_PHILIP._,To what we know. I see that Margaret flies
3052,_PHILIP._,From the discovery that she hath made herself;
3053,_PHILIP._,And fears for Manuel. I grieve but for her.
3054,_PHILIP._,His enmity to you precludes all pity.                           1560
3055,_PHILIP._,"I have come to see his papers, which contain"
3056,_PHILIP._,"Charges against your excellence, prepared"
3057,_PHILIP._,"With such unfriendly skill, that to discredit them,"
3058,_PHILIP._,"Should ever they reach court, would cost far more"
3059,_PHILIP._,Than any price or pains you now might spend
3060,_PHILIP._,In their suppression.
3061,_PHILIP._,
3062,_PHILIP._,"_Hu._                 O, the double-faced"
3063,_PHILIP._,Pretentious Greek! But in this other matter
3064,_PHILIP._,We have him. I’ll charge the deed to his face. He’ll not
3065,_PHILIP._,Deny it. The embassy delayed last night
3066,_PHILIP._,"May sail this evening, and with them aboard                     1570"
3067,_PHILIP._,Shall Manuel fare to the king with his accusers.
3068,_PHILIP._,We shall at least be rid of him. I will call him.
3069,_PHILIP._,
3070,_PHILIP._,[_Rings a bell._
3071,_PHILIP._,
3072,_PHILIP._,Thou hast done me a good service.
3073,_PHILIP._,
3074,_PHILIP._,_Ph._                             Shall I remain?
3075,_PHILIP._,
3076,_PHILIP._,_Hu._ I beg you. The cursed villain!
3077,_PHILIP._,
3078,_PHILIP._,_Enter Servant._
3079,_PHILIP._,
3080,_PHILIP._,I await
3081,_PHILIP._,The chief justiciary. Shew him hither.                [_Exit servt._
3082,_PHILIP._,
3083,_PHILIP._,_Ph._ (_aside_). I shall not face him well. He must not guess
3084,_PHILIP._,"My part in this: say he be proved a traitor,"
3085,_PHILIP._,And I abhor all such as undermine
3086,_PHILIP._,"The fabric of the throne,—yet have I shared"
3087,_PHILIP._,"His guilt at heart, both in my wish to find it                  1580"
3088,_PHILIP._,And from my profit in it! ’Twould seem less foul
3089,_PHILIP._,To steal a man’s fair earnings than to glean
3090,_PHILIP._,The waste of his crime. I’ll stand and take what comes.
3091,_PHILIP._,
3092,_PHILIP._,_Enter Manuel._
3093,_PHILIP._,
3094,_MANUEL._,_MANUEL._
3095,_MANUEL._,
3096,_MANUEL._,My service to your excellence.
3097,_MANUEL._,
3098,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._                          Ay, well."
3099,_MANUEL._,’Tis of thy service I would speak. Attend me.
3100,_MANUEL._,Thou art an honest man; in all Palermo
3101,_MANUEL._,No name so fair as thine. There’s none would dream
3102,_MANUEL._,That thou at any press wouldst blink the right

3105,_MANUEL._,Her majesty for worship: we ourselves
3106,_MANUEL._,Have strained or waived opinion oftentimes
3107,_MANUEL._,In trust of thee. ’Twas not then at first hearing
3108,_MANUEL._,We took the tale which strong concurrent proofs
3109,_MANUEL._,Now make me charge thee with. Know that ’tis said
3110,_MANUEL._,That thou hast given a refuge in thy house
3111,_MANUEL._,"To John Palicio. Deny’t, I pray thee."
3112,_MANUEL._,
3113,_MANUEL._,"_Man_. ’Tis true, your excellence."

3127,_MANUEL._,Palicio is my kinsman: he was driven
3128,_MANUEL._,"Without his purpose, nor with my connivance,"
3129,_MANUEL._,To shelter in my house. The claim of nature
3130,_MANUEL._,Withstood the challenge of my royal duty

3133,_MANUEL._,_Hu._                                Enough!

3135,_MANUEL._,I’ll hear no answer. Though thou wouldst deny
3136,_MANUEL._,"My authority, thou shalt not doubt my power.                    1611"
3137,_MANUEL._,Thou art my prisoner. To-night the embassy
3138,_MANUEL._,Will sail for Spain. Thou goest with them to plead
3139,_MANUEL._,Thy cause before the king.
3140,_MANUEL._,
3141,_MANUEL._,"_Man._                     I shall be ready, sire."

3143,_MANUEL._,_Hu._ Thou wilt be here detained until thy house
3144,_MANUEL._,"Is searched: which done thou wilt go home, and there"
3145,_MANUEL._,"Resign thy keys. Knowing thy doings, sir,"
3146,_MANUEL._,I treat thee as I find thee. We are enemies.
3147,_MANUEL._,
3148,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ I pray your excellence, for your daughter’s sake ...      1619"
3149,_MANUEL._,
3150,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._ My daughter! could I wed her to a traitor,"
3151,_MANUEL._,Would she herself consent?
3152,_MANUEL._,
3153,_MANUEL._,"_Enter LIVIO with the book, and BLASCO._"
3154,_MANUEL._,
3155,_MANUEL._,"_Man._                     Call me not traitor,"
3156,_MANUEL._,Ere I be proved one.
3157,_MANUEL._,
3158,_MANUEL._,_Hu._ (_to Bl._). Ho! call in the guard.             [_Exit Blasco._
3159,_MANUEL._,"(_To Liv._) What bring you, son?                  [_Talks with him._"
3160,_MANUEL._,
3161,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ (_to Ph._).               Philip, before I go;—"
3162,_MANUEL._,"Thou see’st my case. Fate would look black upon me,"
3163,_MANUEL._,Left I no friend to speak for me: but thee
3164,_MANUEL._,I trust. Tell Constance what thou knowest; the rest
3165,_MANUEL._,Margaret can tell you. Add thereto assurance
3166,_MANUEL._,Both of my innocence and speedy acquittal.
3167,_MANUEL._,
3168,_MANUEL._,_Re-enter Blasco with Guards._
3169,_MANUEL._,
3170,_MANUEL._,One word and I am gone. Beware of Blasco.
3171,_MANUEL._,He bears two faces. See he be not trusted                       1630
3172,_MANUEL._,With aught of moment.
3173,_MANUEL._,
3174,_MANUEL._,_Hu._ (_to officer of guard_). The chief justiciary is your prisoner
3175,_MANUEL._,On charge of treason. Guard him in the palace
3176,_MANUEL._,Till you hear more.
3177,_MANUEL._,
3178,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ (_to Ph._). Stand my friend, and God aid thee."
3179,_MANUEL._,
3180,_MANUEL._,[_Exit guarded._
3181,_MANUEL._,
3182,_MANUEL._,_Ph._ (_aside_). And so I may. I am not yet stepped so far
3183,_MANUEL._,"That I must push my purpose, where it wounds"
3184,_MANUEL._,Such ample trust.
3185,_MANUEL._,
3186,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._             Philip, see here."
3187,_MANUEL._,
3188,_MANUEL._,"_Ph._                               What, sire?"
3189,_MANUEL._,
3190,_MANUEL._,_Hu._ From some most friendly hand we have full tidings
3191,_MANUEL._,Of all the rebels; where they may be seized
3192,_MANUEL._,This very night.
3193,_MANUEL._,
3194,_MANUEL._,_Ph._ (_to Liv._). You bring it?
3195,_MANUEL._,
3196,_MANUEL._,_Liv._                           They are betrayed              1640
3197,_MANUEL._,By some one of themselves.
3198,_MANUEL._,
3199,_MANUEL._,_Hu._                      ’Twill end the matter.
3200,_MANUEL._,
3201,_MANUEL._,_Ph._ How came you by it?
3202,_MANUEL._,
3203,_MANUEL._,"_Liv._                    A woman brought it me,"
3204,_MANUEL._,Who said ’twas thrust into her hands by one
3205,_MANUEL._,"She knew not, who escaped. She hath since confessed"
3206,_MANUEL._,That ’twas a maid of Manuel’s.
3207,_MANUEL._,
3208,_MANUEL._,"_Bl._                          Look you, tho’,"
3209,_MANUEL._,How close this follows the discovery
3210,_MANUEL._,"Of Manuel’s treason. It must be that some,"
3211,_MANUEL._,"On whom he used constraint, smelling his fall"
3212,_MANUEL._,Return to loyalty.
3213,_MANUEL._,
3214,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._              Most like. Now, Livio,"
3215,_MANUEL._,Seize them to-night. See thou observe in all                    1650
3216,_MANUEL._,"The dispositions which I have shewn thee. Stay,"
3217,_MANUEL._,There’s first a vacancy to fill: I make thee
3218,_MANUEL._,Justiciary in Manuel’s place: in thine
3219,_MANUEL._,I will take Blasco for my secretary.
3220,_MANUEL._,Meanwhile I lend him thee: thou wilt have need
3221,_MANUEL._,Of his experience.
3222,_MANUEL._,
3223,_MANUEL._,"_Liv._             I thank thee, father."
3224,_MANUEL._,
3225,_MANUEL._,"_Bl._ And I, your excellence."
3226,_MANUEL._,
3227,_MANUEL._,_Hu._                          Now to your work.
3228,_MANUEL._,"And then to Manuel’s house, and take possession"
3229,_MANUEL._,Of all thy office gives thee.
3230,_MANUEL._,
3231,_MANUEL._,[_Exeunt Livio and Blasco._
3232,_MANUEL._,
3233,_MANUEL._,_Hu._ (_to Ph._). Thy matter next:
3234,_MANUEL._,I will fetch Constance.
3235,_MANUEL._,
3236,_MANUEL._,"_Ph._                   Not now, I pray, not now!               1660"
3237,_MANUEL._,
3238,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._ Nay, wherefore wait? This business shall be settled"
3239,_MANUEL._,In a few words. I’ll bring her to thee straight.
3240,_MANUEL._,
3241,_MANUEL._,[_Exit._
3242,_MANUEL._,
3243,_MANUEL._,"_Ph._ I pray you. Nay, he is gone. I must stand to it."
3244,_MANUEL._,I play to win; and now the stakes are mine;
3245,_MANUEL._,Unless against myself for friendship’s claim
3246,_MANUEL._,I should uphold my rival. And he’s guilty.
3247,_MANUEL._,"The papers were his own: them he confessed,"
3248,_MANUEL._,And only deepened treason by the excuse
3249,_MANUEL._,Of kinship with the rebel. And then his servants
3250,_MANUEL._,Cognizant.—On the other hand his confidence                     1670
3251,_MANUEL._,Staggering the evidence: his trust in me
3252,_MANUEL._,To comfort Constance. How should Margaret know
3253,_MANUEL._,"More than the facts, or I deny the facts,"
3254,_MANUEL._,Should I plead for him? And yet against the facts
3255,_MANUEL._,The man himself: his soul revealed to me;
3256,_MANUEL._,"And my persuasion of him. O, he has fallen"
3257,_MANUEL._,"To the popular side. Moreover, his acquittal"
3258,_MANUEL._,"Were Hugo’s ruin. I cannot help him: nay,"
3259,_MANUEL._,"Not though I would; and Fate, which thrusts him down,"
3260,_MANUEL._,Is kind to me.
3261,_MANUEL._,
3262,_MANUEL._,_Re-enter Hugo with Constance._
3263,_MANUEL._,
3264,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._          Constance, see here the duke:                    1680"
3265,_MANUEL._,He hath asked your hand of me: and I most happy
3266,_MANUEL._,In such a match have granted it.
3267,_MANUEL._,
3268,_MANUEL._,_Con._                           I am here
3269,_MANUEL._,"Fooled by a promise of evil, but not this."
3270,_MANUEL._,This is not Manuel’s treason. First of that:
3271,_MANUEL._,Where’s the pretended proof?
3272,_MANUEL._,
3273,_MANUEL._,_Hu._                        He hath confessed it.
3274,_MANUEL._,
3275,_MANUEL._,"_Con._ This tale convicts itself. Treason is close,"
3276,_MANUEL._,And doth not bare the breast. Though here the man
3277,_MANUEL._,Ye wrong were likelier to confess such crime
3278,_MANUEL._,Than once be guilty of it.
3279,_MANUEL._,
3280,_MANUEL._,_Hu._                      He both is guilty
3281,_MANUEL._,And hath confessed.
3282,_MANUEL._,
3283,_MANUEL._,_Con._              To what hath he confessed?                  1690
3284,_MANUEL._,What deed that hatred thus can magnify?
3285,_MANUEL._,
3286,_MANUEL._,_Hu._ ’Twas he contrived Palicio’s late escape;
3287,_MANUEL._,"And being detected and charged by me therewith,"
3288,_MANUEL._,He hath here this hour confessed it. Since which time
3289,_MANUEL._,One of his household hath been traced in league
3290,_MANUEL._,With the conspirators.
3291,_MANUEL._,
3292,_MANUEL._,_Con._                 I believe it not.
3293,_MANUEL._,"Would he speak for you, he were here to speak."
3294,_MANUEL._,
3295,_MANUEL._,_Hu._ But if at least he hath gone out from the palace
3296,_MANUEL._,"Under strict guard, and sails to-night for Spain?"
3297,_MANUEL._,
3298,_MANUEL._,_Con._ He is gone?                                              1700
3299,_MANUEL._,
3300,_MANUEL._,_Hu._              He is gone.
3301,_MANUEL._,
3302,_MANUEL._,_Con._                         Under constraint?
3303,_MANUEL._,
3304,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._                                            Most certain,"
3305,_MANUEL._,And charged with treason.
3306,_MANUEL._,
3307,_MANUEL._,"_Con._ (_turning to Ph._). Now, Philip, I bid thee speak."
3308,_MANUEL._,
3309,_MANUEL._,"_Ph._ Ay, Constance, it is true, but ..."
3310,_MANUEL._,
3311,_MANUEL._,_Con._                                   Ay? thou too.
3312,_MANUEL._,"Ay and but: falsest falsehood, seeking grace"
3313,_MANUEL._,In shame. I knew devilry lurked about
3314,_MANUEL._,When I came hither. I’ll go. I’ll not believe.
3315,_MANUEL._,I shall know truth at last.                                [_Going._
3316,_MANUEL._,
3317,_MANUEL._,"_Hu._                       Nay, Constance, stay."
3318,_MANUEL._,Philip will answer thee. Thou questionest him;
3319,_MANUEL._,Hear him with patience. I shall leave thee with him.
3320,_MANUEL._,"Thou hast been a duteous daughter hitherto,"
3321,_MANUEL._,Recover my good grace ere I return.                             1710
3322,_MANUEL._,"(_To Ph._) ’Twas an omission, duke, I gave no order"
3323,_MANUEL._,To seize the villain’s servants. I’ll go do it.
3324,_MANUEL._,Use thy occasion.                                           [_Exit._
3325,_MANUEL._,
3326,_MANUEL._,"_Ph._             Constance, I beg thy favour."
3327,_MANUEL._,
3328,_MANUEL._,"_Con._ I stay, your grace,—why should I go? My father"
3329,_MANUEL._,Hath bid me hear thee: and ’tis nought to me.
3330,_MANUEL._,"Say what thou wouldst: speak on, nor be officious"
3331,_MANUEL._,"To suit thy meaning to me, for there’s nothing"
3332,_MANUEL._,I can believe or doubt.
3333,_MANUEL._,
3334,_MANUEL._,"_Ph._                   O, Constance, think not"
3335,_MANUEL._,That could I end thy sorrow by denial
3336,_MANUEL._,"Of what thou hast heard, I would not. All is true."
3337,_MANUEL._,My kindest office is to unmask the ill                          1721
3338,_MANUEL._,"That this ill hath prevented, and to show thee"
3339,_MANUEL._,A balance of good. There lies ’gainst Manuel
3340,_MANUEL._,Far more than we have charged and he confessed:
3341,_MANUEL._,"He loves thee, thinkest thou?—He hath used his place"
3342,_MANUEL._,To plot against thy father. I here have papers
3343,_MANUEL._,In which thyself mayst see what accusation
3344,_MANUEL._,"He hath writ in secret. They are addressed to Spain,"
3345,_MANUEL._,And would have been presented ...
3346,_MANUEL._,
3347,_MANUEL._,_Con._                            ’Tis his writing.
3348,_MANUEL._,Whence was this filched?                                        1730
3349,_MANUEL._,
3350,_MANUEL._,_Ph._                    He gave them me himself.
3351,_MANUEL._,
3352,_MANUEL._,"_Con._ O, a most open foe. Did he enjoin thee"
3353,_MANUEL._,To bear them to my father?
3354,_MANUEL._,
3355,_MANUEL._,_Ph._                      Nor have I done so.
3356,_MANUEL._,
3357,_MANUEL._,"_Con._ Then this, duke, yet remains for thee to do."
3358,_MANUEL._,Take them at once. I know not what they mean:
3359,_MANUEL._,But if ’tis secret it may be betrayed.
3360,_MANUEL._,"Do it, I pray thee, do it.                                 [_Exit._"
3361,_MANUEL._,
3362,_MANUEL._,_Ph._                      And I could wince
3363,_MANUEL._,"At such reproach, had I dissembled further"
3364,_MANUEL._,"Than loyalty may deign, grappling with treason."
3365,_MANUEL._,Her anger springs but of that nobleness                         1739
3366,_MANUEL._,Which makes her love worth winning; and in the end
3367,_MANUEL._,It shall be mine again.                                     [_Exit._

3374,_MARGARET._,_MARGARET._
3375,_MARGARET._,
3376,_MARGARET._,How fresh the morning air is. See how the mist
3377,_MARGARET._,"Melts in the sun, and while we look is gone,"
3378,_MARGARET._,Leisurely gathered on his sloping beams.
3379,_MARGARET._,And guarded by her angel towers the city
3380,_MARGARET._,Sleeps like an island in the solemn gray:
3381,_MARGARET._,’Tis beauteous.—
3382,_MARGARET._,
3383,_PALICIO._,_PALICIO._
3384,_PALICIO._,
3385,_PALICIO._,I love the city: it holds the stir.
3386,_PALICIO._,"To-night I shall be there, and to do something"
3387,_PALICIO._,Worthy of thee.
3388,_PALICIO._,
3389,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._          Whate’er thou dost, Giovanni,"
3390,_PALICIO._,I could not love thee more.
3391,_PALICIO._,
3392,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                      Beneath yon roofs                   1750
3393,_PALICIO._,There’s many a heart that quicker beats and leaps
3394,_PALICIO._,To hear my name.
3395,_PALICIO._,
3396,_PALICIO._,_Mar._           Thinkest thou still of them?
3397,_PALICIO._,They love thee not.
3398,_PALICIO._,
3399,_PALICIO._,_Pal._              Not?
3400,_PALICIO._,
3401,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                   Nay; the thousandth part
3402,_PALICIO._,Of my love dealt among them were enough
3403,_PALICIO._,To make each man a hero. Now they are brave
3404,_PALICIO._,"Only to cheer thee on: and I that love thee,"
3405,_PALICIO._,"And love but thee, shall lose thee."
3406,_PALICIO._,
3407,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                              Have better faith,"
3408,_PALICIO._,All will be well.
3409,_PALICIO._,
3410,_PALICIO._,_Mar._            Pray heaven it be.
3411,_PALICIO._,
3412,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._                               O, Margaret,"
3413,_PALICIO._,Speak not so sadly: I would have thee brave
3414,_PALICIO._,To cheer me on as they. Last night I dreamed                    1760
3415,_PALICIO._,That thou hadst turned against me.
3416,_PALICIO._,
3417,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                             What, Giovanni?"
3418,_PALICIO._,
3419,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ Thou didst deride me.
3420,_PALICIO._,
3421,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                       I deride thy dream.
3422,_PALICIO._,
3423,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ I thought I failed, and lost thy love."
3424,_PALICIO._,
3425,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                                        O, faithless,"
3426,_PALICIO._,That could not lose my love. If thou succeed
3427,_PALICIO._,"Or fail, ’tis one. But tell me, giv’st thou heed"
3428,_PALICIO._,"To visions? Are they not a fickle fabric,"
3429,_PALICIO._,"Distorted fancies of the spirit, intruding"
3430,_PALICIO._,By night in memory’s darkened cell? Or holdst thou
3431,_PALICIO._,They come from heaven?
3432,_PALICIO._,
3433,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                 Ay. Talk not of them now.
3434,_PALICIO._,Let me not think of it.—
3435,_PALICIO._,
3436,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                    See here the flowers                  1770
3437,_PALICIO._,"I have plucked. Know’st thou, Giovanni, why they grow?"
3438,_PALICIO._,
3439,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ How meanest thou?
3440,_PALICIO._,
3441,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                   Why in one place one flower
3442,_PALICIO._,"Will grow, and not another."
3443,_PALICIO._,
3444,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                      Canst thou tell?
3445,_PALICIO._,
3446,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._ The spirits of good men, allowed to wander"
3447,_PALICIO._,After their death about the mortal sites
3448,_PALICIO._,"Where once they dwelt, there where they love to rest"
3449,_PALICIO._,"Shed virtue on the soil, as doth a ray"
3450,_PALICIO._,Of sunlight: but the immortal qualities
3451,_PALICIO._,"By which their races differ, as they once"
3452,_PALICIO._,"Differed in blood alive, with various power                     1780"
3453,_PALICIO._,Favour the various vegetable germs
3454,_PALICIO._,"With kindred specialty. This herb, I think,"
3455,_PALICIO._,Grows where the Greek hath been. Its beauty shows
3456,_PALICIO._,"A subtle and full knowledge, and betrays"
3457,_PALICIO._,A genius of contrivance. Seest thou how
3458,_PALICIO._,The fading emerald and azure blent
3459,_PALICIO._,On the white petals are immeshed about
3460,_PALICIO._,With delicate sprigs of green? ’Tis therefore called
3461,_PALICIO._,Love-in-a-mist.
3462,_PALICIO._,
3463,_PALICIO._,_Pal._          Who is this thistle here?
3464,_PALICIO._,
3465,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._ O, he, with plumèd crest, springing all armed"
3466,_PALICIO._,"In steely lustre, and erect as Mars,                            1791"
3467,_PALICIO._,That is the Roman.
3468,_PALICIO._,
3469,_PALICIO._,_Pal._             Find the Saracen.
3470,_PALICIO._,
3471,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._ This hot gladiolus, with waving swords"
3472,_PALICIO._,And crying colour.
3473,_PALICIO._,
3474,_PALICIO._,_Pal._             And this marigold?
3475,_PALICIO._,
3476,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._ That is the Norman: nay, his furious blood"
3477,_PALICIO._,Blazes the secret. ’Tis said where’er he roamed
3478,_PALICIO._,This flower is common; but ’tis in those climes
3479,_PALICIO._,"Where he wrought best it wears the strongest hue,"
3480,_PALICIO._,And so with us ’tis bravest.
3481,_PALICIO._,
3482,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                       And that’s thy countryman!
3483,_PALICIO._,Dost thou know Greek?
3484,_PALICIO._,
3485,_PALICIO._,_Mar._                My father ever spoke it;                  1800
3486,_PALICIO._,"And Manuel made me study in it, because"
3487,_PALICIO._,Their learning was the best.
3488,_PALICIO._,
3489,_PALICIO._,_Pal._                       And yet their books
3490,_PALICIO._,"Were little thought of till great Frederick’s time,—"
3491,_PALICIO._,The infidel.

3493,_PALICIO._,_Mar._       Was he an infidel?
3494,_PALICIO._,
3495,_PALICIO._,_Pal._ He loved their heathen books and mocked the Pope:
3496,_PALICIO._,"And brought into his court a Scottish wizard,"
3497,_PALICIO._,"Who trafficked with the devil.—See, Margaret;"
3498,_PALICIO._,Their courts are all alike. Here is the letter
3499,_PALICIO._,Fat Blasco writes me. He betrays his master
3500,_PALICIO._,For those few coins thou gav’st me in thy bag.                  1810

3504,_PALICIO._,Gold goeth in at any gate but heaven’s.
3505,_PALICIO._,"Ay, ’tis his writing, tho’ it be not signed."
3506,_PALICIO._,"It tells how Hugo would escape by ship,"
3507,_PALICIO._,And how to intercept him.
3508,_PALICIO._,
3509,_PALICIO._,_Enter hastily a Brigand._

3515,_BRIGAND._,"_Pal._ Speak, Roger."
3516,_BRIGAND._,
3517,_BRIGAND._,"_Brig._              ’Tis for thee, captain, alone."
3518,_BRIGAND._,
3519,_BRIGAND._,"_Pal._ I am alone, this lady is as I."
3520,_BRIGAND._,What is’t?
3521,_BRIGAND._,
3522,_BRIGAND._,_Brig._ Thou biddest?
3523,_BRIGAND._,
3524,_BRIGAND._,"_Pal._                Speak, man, by heav’n!"

3527,_BRIGAND._,Are all betrayed. They were in dark of night
3528,_BRIGAND._,Closely surrounded at their several trysts                      1819
3529,_BRIGAND._,"By Hugo’s soldiers; bound, and taken to prison."
3530,_BRIGAND._,
3531,_BRIGAND._,"_Pal._ O, Christ! my dream."
3532,_BRIGAND._,
3533,_BRIGAND._,"_Mar._ (_aside_).           Now, well done, Livio!"
3534,_BRIGAND._,Done like a man.
3535,_BRIGAND._,
3536,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._           Thou say’st all taken?
3537,_BRIGAND._,
3538,_BRIGAND._,_Brig._                                 All.
3539,_BRIGAND._,
3540,_BRIGAND._,_Mar._ (_aside_). I fear joy will betray me.
3541,_BRIGAND._,
3542,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._                                       It cannot be
3543,_BRIGAND._,They are all betrayed.
3544,_BRIGAND._,
3545,_BRIGAND._,_Brig._                As many as had assembled
3546,_BRIGAND._,At the ten trysts were taken.
3547,_BRIGAND._,
3548,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._                        Who hath done it?
3549,_BRIGAND._,"(_To Mar._) Take courage, dearest."
3550,_BRIGAND._,
3551,_BRIGAND._,"_Mar._                             Ay, ay."
3552,_BRIGAND._,
3553,_BRIGAND._,"_Pal._                                     Nay, thou’rt pale."
3554,_BRIGAND._,
3555,_BRIGAND._,_Mar._ I thought that I should faint. (_To Pal. aside._)
3556,_BRIGAND._,"O, fly, Giovanni!"
3557,_BRIGAND._,Fly now with me! thou see’st this game is lost.
3558,_BRIGAND._,
3559,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._ Be still awhile. (_To Brigand._) And where wert thou?
3560,_BRIGAND._,
3561,_BRIGAND._,"_Brig._ In the city,"
3562,_BRIGAND._,From house to house.
3563,_BRIGAND._,
3564,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._               What say they there?
3565,_BRIGAND._,
3566,_BRIGAND._,_Brig._                                   This tale             1830
3567,_BRIGAND._,I heard. ’Tis told that ’mongst our men was one
3568,_BRIGAND._,"Of Benedettu’s band, who, being engirt,"
3569,_BRIGAND._,Stabbed himself to the heart. Some cried thereon
3570,_BRIGAND._,That he was the betrayer. There are others
3571,_BRIGAND._,Who dare the thought I would not breathe if thou
3572,_BRIGAND._,Couldst think I thought it.
3573,_BRIGAND._,
3574,_BRIGAND._,"_Pal._                      Hold! I know, I see."
3575,_BRIGAND._,All hath been like to build it. Who is with thee?
3576,_BRIGAND._,
3577,_BRIGAND._,"_Brig._ Three, and the boy Federigo."
3578,_BRIGAND._,
3579,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._                               Go to the hut:
3580,_BRIGAND._,There I will join you.                             [_Exit Brigand._
3581,_BRIGAND._,"Margaret, fare thee well"
3582,_BRIGAND._,Now for some time. This most untoward treason
3583,_BRIGAND._,Demands my care. Lucia is not far.                              1841
3584,_BRIGAND._,
3585,_BRIGAND._,_Mar._ What wilt thou do?
3586,_BRIGAND._,
3587,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._                    Whatever may be done:
3588,_BRIGAND._,Trust me.
3589,_BRIGAND._,
3590,_BRIGAND._,"_Mar._    O, while thou’rt safe, Giovanni, fly."
3591,_BRIGAND._,I claim thy promise. Remember it: thou wilt see
3592,_BRIGAND._,If I deride thee. We will make this ill
3593,_BRIGAND._,Our perfect good.
3594,_BRIGAND._,
3595,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._            It cannot be. It cannot.
3596,_BRIGAND._,
3597,_BRIGAND._,_Mar._ What wilt thou do?
3598,_BRIGAND._,
3599,_BRIGAND._,_Pal._                    I know not. Thou remain.
3600,_BRIGAND._,"I will go see these men, and send thee word."
3601,_BRIGAND._,Farewell.                                                   [_Exit._
3602,_BRIGAND._,
3603,_BRIGAND._,"_Mar._    O, I had betrayed myself but that my fear"
3604,_BRIGAND._,"Took other pretext. Ah! well done, well done!                   1851"
3605,_BRIGAND._,"The ruffians caught—Giovanni safe, and mine;"
3606,_BRIGAND._,"Giovanni mine. Ah, Messer Squarcialupu,"
3607,_BRIGAND._,"And all your gang. Lucia, ho, Lucia!                     [_Calling._"
3608,_BRIGAND._,"Yet will I have them treated well. Ay, now,"
3609,_BRIGAND._,Manuel must know. No drop of their base blood
3610,_BRIGAND._,Shall stain my hand. Lucia!

3617,_LUCIA._,
3618,_LUCIA._,"_Mar._ The men are caught, Lucia; all goes well."
3619,_LUCIA._,There’s none to steal Giovanni from me now.
3620,_LUCIA._,We go to Rome. But first I must see Manuel.                     1860
3621,_LUCIA._,
3622,_LUCIA._,_Lu._ I pray he take all kindly.
3623,_LUCIA._,
3624,_LUCIA._,_Mar._                           I fear him not.
3625,_LUCIA._,"Giovanni promised, should this venture fail,"
3626,_LUCIA._,To sail to Rome.
3627,_LUCIA._,
3628,_LUCIA._,_Lu._            And I? shall I to Rome?
3629,_LUCIA._,
3630,_LUCIA._,"_Mar._ See, see! who is it, that gallops down the hill?"
3631,_LUCIA._,"Why, ’tis Giovanni!"
3632,_LUCIA._,
3633,_LUCIA._,"_Lu._               Where, my lady, where?"
3634,_LUCIA._,
3635,_LUCIA._,_Mar._ See’st thou not by the firs?
3636,_LUCIA._,
3637,_LUCIA._,"_Lu._                               I hear the hoofs,"
3638,_LUCIA._,But cannot see the rider.
3639,_LUCIA._,
3640,_LUCIA._,_Mar._                    There he goes:
3641,_LUCIA._,Now on the road.
3642,_LUCIA._,
3643,_LUCIA._,_Lu._            I see him.
3644,_LUCIA._,
3645,_LUCIA._,"_Mar._                      Look, Lucia;"
3646,_LUCIA._,That is his horse.
3647,_LUCIA._,
3648,_LUCIA._,_Lu._              Maybe a messenger
3649,_LUCIA._,He mounts for speed. He rides to Monreale.                      1870
3650,_LUCIA._,
3651,_LUCIA._,"_Mar._ Now we shall see. Nay, nay: he turns to the left."
3652,_LUCIA._,"He’s for Palermo: and ’tis he, ’tis he,"

3666,_LUCIA._,"_Margaret, there’s but one course. My men suspect me."
3667,_LUCIA._,"Of those who held this secret, I alone"

3847,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ (_standing, and showing the dagger_). Away! away!"
3848,_MARGARET._,
3849,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._ Nay, wherefore treat me thus?"
3850,_MARGARET._,
3851,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                               Is this an hour
3852,_MARGARET._,To force thy love upon me?
3853,_MARGARET._,
3854,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._                     Margaret,"
3855,_MARGARET._,Hast thou no pity?
3856,_MARGARET._,
3857,_MARGARET._,_Mar._             Think if I have pity
3858,_MARGARET._,To spend on thee.
3859,_MARGARET._,
3860,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._            If thou wouldst slay me, Margaret,"
3861,_MARGARET._,Thou need’st no dagger.
3862,_MARGARET._,
3863,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                  Sir, stand back, I say:                 1970"
3864,_MARGARET._,And first tell plainly what thou knowest. One ship
3865,_MARGARET._,Of three escaped?
3866,_MARGARET._,
3867,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._            The hindmost ’twas, that fled ..."
3868,_MARGARET._,
3869,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ And brought the tidings?
3870,_MARGARET._,
3871,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                          Ay.
3872,_MARGARET._,
3873,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                              And was none saved
3874,_MARGARET._,Out of the ship which sunk?
3875,_MARGARET._,
3876,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                      I know not.
3877,_MARGARET._,
3878,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                                  Know’st not?
3879,_MARGARET._,"There’s hope, thank God. And thou!—Why, if in thy heart"
3880,_MARGARET._,"Lurked the least feeling, ’twould have shewn this side,"
3881,_MARGARET._,"Not leapt to the worst ... Come, sir, I’ll keep this sorrow:"
3882,_MARGARET._,’Tis not with thee I’d share my fear for Manuel ...
3883,_MARGARET._,"Nor any other; tho’ my need compels me,"
3884,_MARGARET._,If thou’rt the man sits in his place.

3889,_MARGARET._,
3890,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                         But I will aid thee
3891,_MARGARET._,More than a brother. Thou canst ask no favour
3892,_MARGARET._,I will not grant.
3893,_MARGARET._,
3894,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._            Sir, I shall ask no favour:"
3895,_MARGARET._,"Nor aught but what it is thy part to grant,"
3896,_MARGARET._,Unless it be promise of secrecy.
3897,_MARGARET._,
3898,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._ O, but one secret with thee! there’s no jewel"
3899,_MARGARET._,In all the world I would esteem as that.
3900,_MARGARET._,
3901,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ Where’s Giovanni Palicio, sir?"
3902,_MARGARET._,
3903,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                                Palicio!
3904,_MARGARET._,
3905,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ Ay, he’s my kinsman."
3906,_MARGARET._,
3907,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._                      He is in the palace dungeon,"
3908,_MARGARET._,Awaiting death.
3909,_MARGARET._,
3910,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._          He’s my near kinsman, Livio,                    1990"
3911,_MARGARET._,"And must not die: and, being condemned to die,"
3912,_MARGARET._,"I, as his kinswoman, desire a pass"
3913,_MARGARET._,To visit him in prison when I choose.               [_Livio writes._
3914,_MARGARET._,My purpose with him is to extort a pledge
3915,_MARGARET._,"That he will leave the country, on which condition"
3916,_MARGARET._,I look for his release.
3917,_MARGARET._,
3918,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                  Here is the order.
3919,_MARGARET._,And use it as thou wilt.
3920,_MARGARET._,
3921,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ (_taking_).       I thank you for it.
3922,_MARGARET._,
3923,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._ If ’tis so near thee he go quit, what means"
3924,_MARGARET._,Better than mine to work it?
3925,_MARGARET._,
3926,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                       I have means.
3927,_MARGARET._,
3928,_MARGARET._,_Liv._ With whom?
3929,_MARGARET._,
3930,_MARGARET._,_Mar._            I have the means.
3931,_MARGARET._,
3932,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                              Believe it not.             2000
3933,_MARGARET._,There’s none could win this favour of my father.
3934,_MARGARET._,Hath not his cry been _Death to Hugo_?
3935,_MARGARET._,He’s more than rebel. There’s a private hate
3936,_MARGARET._,Which makes his sentence grateful.
3937,_MARGARET._,
3938,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                            I have means.
3939,_MARGARET._,
3940,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._ ’Twere easier wouldst thou trust me. See, ’tis done"
3941,_MARGARET._,"Without more words. Margaret, I’ll risk this thing"
3942,_MARGARET._,"For thee. Palicio shall escape to Spain,"
3943,_MARGARET._,"To Naples, where thou wilt, if thou ..."
3944,_MARGARET._,
3945,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                                  If what?
3946,_MARGARET._,
3947,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._ Margaret, accept my love."
3948,_MARGARET._,
3949,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                           O, Livio,"
3950,_MARGARET._,I am too sad to be angry with thee now.                         2010
3951,_MARGARET._,But know if ever thou wouldst merit love
3952,_MARGARET._,"By generosity, thou must not beg"
3953,_MARGARET._,"A bargain. ’Do this and I’ll love thee,’ ay,"
3954,_MARGARET._,"That may be said, but not ’I’ll do this thing"
3955,_MARGARET._,"If thou wilt love me’: and thou, Livio,"
3956,_MARGARET._,A chief justiciary!

3963,_MARGARET._,In this return.
3964,_MARGARET._,
3965,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ (_aside to Blasco_). What hadst thou of Palicio?
3966,_MARGARET._,
3967,_MARGARET._,_Bl._ Ha! Sayst thou?...
3968,_MARGARET._,
3969,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ (_aside_).        Meet me at the palace, count."
3970,_MARGARET._,I have thy letter. (_To Liv._) I see there is no place here      2020
3971,_MARGARET._,"In my house for me. I have still a hope, and in it"
3972,_MARGARET._,Shall fortify my comfort ... If aught is heard
3973,_MARGARET._,I shall be with thy sister. Thou and Blasco

3979,_MARGARET._,"I bring ill news. Thy sister still is worse,"
3980,_MARGARET._,"And calls for thee, and Rosso thinks ’tis well"
3981,_MARGARET._,That thou shouldst go.

4127,_ROSSO._,"_Mar._                 Good God! Now if thou’rt right,"
4128,_ROSSO._,"Rosso, this matter needs me more than the other."
4129,_ROSSO._,Thank heaven I am here. Constance is in thy hands:
4130,_ROSSO._,"Thou hast her cure. Yet use it with discretion,"
4131,_ROSSO._,Knowing my hazard. I shall visit at once                        2090

4137,_ROSSO._,"Farewell. I go, yet must I take a name;"
4138,_ROSSO._,"Let it be Thomas, father Thomas. To-night"
4139,_ROSSO._,Can I rest at thy house?

4200,_PHILIP._,’Tis all I pray for.
4201,_PHILIP._,
4202,_PHILIP._,_Hu._                Not so. This will pass.
4203,_PHILIP._,’Twill be forgotten. All will be forgotten.
4204,_PHILIP._,"Look but on Margaret, doth her brother’s death"
4205,_PHILIP._,Craze her?
4206,_PHILIP._,
4207,_PHILIP._,"_Ph._      Indeed, I think she is nigh distracted;"
4208,_PHILIP._,And if she bear up better there’s a reason:                     2130
4209,_PHILIP._,"She hath a comforter. Nay, I may tell you"
4210,_PHILIP._,"I saw your doctor here take her aside,"
4211,_PHILIP._,"And when he spoke, her face of woe lit up."
4212,_PHILIP._,She loves him. ’Twas a match that Manuel wished.
4213,_PHILIP._,
4214,_PHILIP._,"_Hu._ Nay, nay! what! Rosso, the apothecary!"
4215,_PHILIP._,
4216,_PHILIP._,_Enter Livio and Blasco._
4217,_PHILIP._,
4218,_PHILIP._,"Ah, Livio; Constance calls thy name, ’tis hoped"

4222,_LIVIO._,
4223,_LIVIO._,"Is she better, sire?"
4224,_LIVIO._,
4225,_LIVIO._,"_Hu._ Nay: but she asked for thee, and Rosso said"
4226,_LIVIO._,Thou shouldst be sent for. Come within.
4227,_LIVIO._,
4228,_LIVIO._,_Ph._                                   May I

4237,_LIVIO._,
4238,_LIVIO._,[_Exeunt Hugo and Livio._
4239,_LIVIO._,
4240,_LIVIO._,"_Ph._ Count, thou hast lied to me. If that suffice"
4241,_LIVIO._,"To raise thy temper, meet me when thou wilt:"
4242,_LIVIO._,"If not, and Constance die, I’ll use thee worse.            [_Exit._"
4243,_LIVIO._,
4244,_LIVIO._,"_Bl._ Ay, ay. No doubt there may be danger for me"
4245,_LIVIO._,Even from that quarter: but I have a foe
4246,_LIVIO._,That threats me more. How came she by the letter?
4247,_LIVIO._,Only Palicio and his messenger
4248,_LIVIO._,Could know ’twas mine.
4249,_LIVIO._,
4250,_LIVIO._,_Enter Margaret._

4252,_MARGARET._,_MARGARET._
4253,_MARGARET._,
4254,_MARGARET._,"’Tis business with thee, count:"

4256,_MARGARET._,"And other proofs, which I shall bring against thee"
4257,_MARGARET._,Unless thou do my bidding.
4258,_MARGARET._,
4259,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._                      What is that,                        2152"
4260,_MARGARET._,My lady Peremptory? speak thy will.
4261,_MARGARET._,
4262,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ Attend. Palicio is condemned to die
4263,_MARGARET._,At noon to-morrow. I require that thou
4264,_MARGARET._,"Contrive that he escape, ay, and go clear"
4265,_MARGARET._,Three hours before that time.
4266,_MARGARET._,
4267,_MARGARET._,_Bl._                         Impossible.
4268,_MARGARET._,
4269,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ ’Tis not so, count. For Livio had promised me"
4270,_MARGARET._,The very thing; but since his price exceeds
4271,_MARGARET._,What I need pay to thee ...
4272,_MARGARET._,
4273,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._                       My price, how mean you?             2160"
4274,_MARGARET._,
4275,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ I will give back thy letter to thy hands,"
4276,_MARGARET._,And promise secrecy in every matter
4277,_MARGARET._,I had against thee.
4278,_MARGARET._,
4279,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._               Give me now the letter,"
4280,_MARGARET._,And I will do it.
4281,_MARGARET._,
4282,_MARGARET._,_Mar._            Nay. Thou’lt do it first.
4283,_MARGARET._,
4284,_MARGARET._,_Bl._ Then say that if at nine to-morrow morn
4285,_MARGARET._,I have a friendly guard—
4286,_MARGARET._,
4287,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                    Keep to that hour:
4288,_MARGARET._,’Twill do. I shall be there to see it done.
4289,_MARGARET._,I’ll bring the letter with me. I can provide
4290,_MARGARET._,"His further safety. If thou fail, the enquiry,"
4291,_MARGARET._,"Which I can set on foot, delays his death,                      2170"
4292,_MARGARET._,Till I find other means.
4293,_MARGARET._,
4294,_MARGARET._,_Bl._                    But still I see not
4295,_MARGARET._,My own security.
4296,_MARGARET._,
4297,_MARGARET._,_Mar._           Thou hast my promise:
4298,_MARGARET._,"And thy security is only this,"
4299,_MARGARET._,"To keep to thine. I go. Remember, nine.                     [_Exit._"
4300,_MARGARET._,
4301,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._ Wheu! wheu! Who hath the secret now? Indeed,"
4302,_MARGARET._,I see this dainty lady hath a lover
4303,_MARGARET._,We little dreamed of. Therefore was he housed
4304,_MARGARET._,"With Manuel. O, Giovann Palicio:"
4305,_MARGARET._,Thus Livio’s rival. And thou blab of me
4306,_MARGARET._,"To mistress Margaret, dost thou? well, well, well!"
4307,_MARGARET._,I’ll see thee die for that. Die now thou must.                  2181
4308,_MARGARET._,"I have, sir, but to tell this tale in the ear"
4309,_MARGARET._,"Of the chief justiciary, and I am saved."
4310,_MARGARET._,
4311,_MARGARET._,_Re-enter Livio._
4312,_MARGARET._,
4313,_MARGARET._,"Livio, thou hast a rival."
4314,_MARGARET._,
4315,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                    I know.
4316,_MARGARET._,
4317,_MARGARET._,_Bl._                             Thou knowest?
4318,_MARGARET._,
4319,_MARGARET._,_Liv._ My father saith Margaret will marry Rosso.
4320,_MARGARET._,
4321,_MARGARET._,_Bl._ Rosso! Rosso be hanged! ’Tis John Palicio.
4322,_MARGARET._,
4323,_MARGARET._,_Liv._ Palicio!
4324,_MARGARET._,
4325,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._           Yes, Palicio."
4326,_MARGARET._,
4327,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                        Nay.
4328,_MARGARET._,
4329,_MARGARET._,_Bl._                              I’ll tell thee.
4330,_MARGARET._,Hark.—Was he not concealed in Manuel’s house?
4331,_MARGARET._,
4332,_MARGARET._,_Liv._ Well?
4333,_MARGARET._,
4334,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._        And escaping from his house by night,"
4335,_MARGARET._,The next day where was Margaret?
4336,_MARGARET._,
4337,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                           Ah!
4338,_MARGARET._,
4339,_MARGARET._,_Bl._                                And then                   2190
4340,_MARGARET._,’Twas she betrayed the rebels.
4341,_MARGARET._,
4342,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                         Eh!
4343,_MARGARET._,
4344,_MARGARET._,_Bl._                              We traced
4345,_MARGARET._,The little book to her servant.
4346,_MARGARET._,
4347,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                          That’s against it.
4348,_MARGARET._,
4349,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._ Nay: it explains why all the names were there,"
4350,_MARGARET._,Only not his.
4351,_MARGARET._,
4352,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._        But then ... nay, why should he"
4353,_MARGARET._,Surrender?
4354,_MARGARET._,
4355,_MARGARET._,_Bl._      That’s but madness any way.
4356,_MARGARET._,But now she comes demanding his deliverance.
4357,_MARGARET._,
4358,_MARGARET._,"_Liv._ Ay, she doth. O, the villain! he shall die."
4359,_MARGARET._,
4360,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._ He shall; but hark, I have promised Margaret"
4361,_MARGARET._,To set Palicio free at nine to-morrow.
4362,_MARGARET._,Say that we go together. Margaret comes                         2200
4363,_MARGARET._,To see her lover freed. Her we will take
4364,_MARGARET._,And keep confined until his execution;
4365,_MARGARET._,Which for our purpose may be hurried on.
4366,_MARGARET._,Or if ...
4367,_MARGARET._,
4368,_MARGARET._,_Liv._    Stay; why this promise? In the course
4369,_MARGARET._,Of justice he must die.
4370,_MARGARET._,
4371,_MARGARET._,_Bl._                   Not so. My promise
4372,_MARGARET._,To set him free was made for two good reasons.
4373,_MARGARET._,First hearing thou hadst offered her the like:
4374,_MARGARET._,Next for the knowledge that on my refusal
4375,_MARGARET._,She could find other means. Beside all which
4376,_MARGARET._,She bargains to restore me certain letters                      2210
4377,_MARGARET._,"I sent her years ago, which I confess"
4378,_MARGARET._,I am now ashamed of: (_aside._)—Any lie will serve
4379,_MARGARET._,"To smooth this idiot.—These she brings with her,"
4380,_MARGARET._,And I can take them from her. My object gained
4381,_MARGARET._,I hand her o’er to thee. For all her scorns
4382,_MARGARET._,Repay her as thou wilt.
4383,_MARGARET._,
4384,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                  I fear her.
4385,_MARGARET._,
4386,_MARGARET._,"_Bl._                               Nay,"
4387,_MARGARET._,I can secure thee. Come.                                  [_Exeunt._

4495,_MANUEL._,I thread the narrow way; I climb at heaven.
4496,_MANUEL._,"If I touch this, I perish._ But he said,"

4498,_MANUEL._,’Twas the old tale—“Thou shalt not surely die.”

4534,_MANUEL._,"I needed but a priest to comfort me,"
4535,_MANUEL._,And show me on death’s road: thou drag’st me back
4536,_MANUEL._,To torture me. Thou canst not understand.
4537,_MANUEL._,
4538,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ Thou ow’st to me more than to any priest,"
4539,_MANUEL._,"Who for thy sake might hear, to tell me true."

4541,_MANUEL._,
4542,_MANUEL._,"_Pal._                  If thou wert a priest,                  2310"
4543,_MANUEL._,Then wouldst thou see how well the stalking fiend
4544,_MANUEL._,Snared for my soul. I planned for yesternight
4545,_MANUEL._,To storm the palace: and I had promised Margaret
4546,_MANUEL._,"To make no further venture if that failed,"
4547,_MANUEL._,"But sail with her to Rome and there be married,"
4548,_MANUEL._,Using thy interest to reclaim my rank.
4549,_MANUEL._,"But on the day I gave that word, my men"
4550,_MANUEL._,"Were all betrayed, taken, and led to prison."
4551,_MANUEL._,"I was with Margaret, as well they knew:"
4552,_MANUEL._,"My love for her, my shelter at thy house,                       2320"
4553,_MANUEL._,"My flight permitted, set them on the thought"
4554,_MANUEL._,"That I had been corrupted, was the traitor."
4555,_MANUEL._,"_Fly with me_, then cried Margaret. Ay, the fiend too"
4556,_MANUEL._,"Said, _Fly: go safe_. I foiled him. I came here."
4557,_MANUEL._,That was my only answer.
4558,_MANUEL._,
4559,_MANUEL._,_Man._                   And didst thou not
4560,_MANUEL._,Betray them?
4561,_MANUEL._,
4562,_MANUEL._,_Pal._       I! Palicio! when did I
4563,_MANUEL._,Betray?
4564,_MANUEL._,
4565,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ Stay, while in turn I shew to thee"
4566,_MANUEL._,Another tale made of the self-same matter.—
4567,_MANUEL._,"A price set on thy head, pursued by justice,"
4568,_MANUEL._,"Bleeding to death, thou camest to my house                      2330"
4569,_MANUEL._,"Asking for shelter, begging but for life."
4570,_MANUEL._,"I gave it at my risk,—how great that risk"
4571,_MANUEL._,I’ll shew thee soon;—there at my house my sister
4572,_MANUEL._,"Secretly tended thee, and won thy cure."
4573,_MANUEL._,"Thou in return didst, all unknown to me,"
4574,_MANUEL._,"Obtain her love, and use it to break trust,"
4575,_MANUEL._,"Flying by stealth at night: and then, being fled,"
4576,_MANUEL._,"Didst scruple not to use thy flight, to work"
4577,_MANUEL._,The very thing for which thy life was owed.
4578,_MANUEL._,"Further, when that went wrong, merely for fear                  2340"
4579,_MANUEL._,"Men should think ill of thee, thou didst desert"
4580,_MANUEL._,"Her, to whose love was due that thou wert free;"
4581,_MANUEL._,"Wronging her then again, as me before ..."
4582,_MANUEL._,
4583,_MANUEL._,"_Pal._ Manuel, forbear; thee I confess I wronged:"
4584,_MANUEL._,For the rest thy taunts are vain.
4585,_MANUEL._,
4586,_MANUEL._,_Man._                            Wait: there is more.—
4587,_MANUEL._,"Thy refuge being discovered, I was charged"
4588,_MANUEL._,"With treason, and in course shipped hence for Spain."
4589,_MANUEL._,"My ship was sunk, and I, but for God’s mercy,"
4590,_MANUEL._,Drowned. My disgrace and rumoured death so wrought
4591,_MANUEL._,"On Constance, that she lies in life’s last hope.                2350"
4592,_MANUEL._,To all of us thou hast done unmeasured ill:
4593,_MANUEL._,What is thy plea?
4594,_MANUEL._,
4595,_MANUEL._,"_Pal._            Though God himself should curse me,"
4596,_MANUEL._,My purpose hath been good.
4597,_MANUEL._,
4598,_MANUEL._,"_Man._                     Ay, that I’ll grant:"
4599,_MANUEL._,"Thou’rt for the right, but being too hot upon it"
4600,_MANUEL._,Mistakest right. Thou art numbered with the madmen
4601,_MANUEL._,"Who, thinking the whole world’s unhappiness"
4602,_MANUEL._,"Hangs on one string, tread all else underfoot"
4603,_MANUEL._,So they may reach to cut it.—And where’s the good?
4604,_MANUEL._,"Thyself, too, in what plight, that after all"
4605,_MANUEL._,"This sacrifice of others’ rights, thou rushest                  2360"
4606,_MANUEL._,"To die to save thine honour from a stain,"
4607,_MANUEL._,That needs no washing!
4608,_MANUEL._,
4609,_MANUEL._,_Pal._                 Enough: there let it end:
4610,_MANUEL._,I die to-morrow.
4611,_MANUEL._,
4612,_MANUEL._,"_Man._           Nay, thou must escape:"
4613,_MANUEL._,Retrieve all that thou canst. I now shall go
4614,_MANUEL._,"To Margaret, whom before I feared to meet."
4615,_MANUEL._,"She will be working for thee. If she fail,"
4616,_MANUEL._,The archbishop yet hath power to stay thy death
4617,_MANUEL._,"Till I can serve thee. If thy love for her,"
4618,_MANUEL._,"And hers for thee abide, you must be married."
4619,_MANUEL._,"Nay, all she urged was good."
4620,_MANUEL._,
4621,_MANUEL._,"_Pal._                       O, ’tis impossible.                2370"
4622,_MANUEL._,Work not for my escape: ’tis best I die.
4623,_MANUEL._,
4624,_MANUEL._,"_Man._ Nay, nay. Thou that canst fight, fight with thyself."
4625,_MANUEL._,The brave despair that fear not: that’s the shock
4626,_MANUEL._,The strongest suffer. Thou wast ill of late;
4627,_MANUEL._,"Wert thou now strong, shame would not crush thy spirit.     [_Going._"
4628,_MANUEL._,
4629,_MANUEL._,"_Pal._ Manuel, go not!"
4630,_MANUEL._,
4631,_MANUEL._,"_Man._                 Yes, I must go. Remember"
4632,_MANUEL._,My name is Father Thomas. None must guess
4633,_MANUEL._,Who hath been with thee.—Farewell. Fight with thyself;
4634,_MANUEL._,"Palicio, with thyself. Thou shalt be saved.                 [_Exit._"

4650,_PALICIO._,Moonlight for dawn. Now soon will Margaret come:
4651,_PALICIO._,"And I must go forth to the world disgraced,"
4652,_PALICIO._,"To fly my country or hide: ay, at the cue"
4653,_PALICIO._,"Of the chief justiciary, led by a woman."
4654,_PALICIO._,"Hast thou the heart, Giovann Palicio,"

4669,_MARGARET._,
4670,_MARGARET._,"’Tis I, Giovanni: all is well: thou’rt safe,"
4671,_MARGARET._,Manuel has told me all. Thou dost repent.
4672,_MARGARET._,All is prepared. Ask not my pardon: give me
4673,_MARGARET._,One kiss—I have forgiven thee. Be not sad.                      2400
4674,_MARGARET._,"’Twas like thee as I love thee, nobly done:"
4675,_MARGARET._,And being so cruel to thyself ’twas easy
4676,_MARGARET._,"Thou shouldst forget what I too now forget,"
4677,_MARGARET._,"Recovering thee. I saw thee ride away,"
4678,_MARGARET._,"And guessed before the letter. O, Giovanni,"
4679,_MARGARET._,"Thank God, thou’rt safe. Look, I have brought the money"
4680,_MARGARET._,To serve thee on thy journey till the day
4681,_MARGARET._,We meet again; and more. Thy ship will sail
4682,_MARGARET._,But to Messina: there thou wilt disbark.
4683,_MARGARET._,"Nay, take the money; thou wilt need it, love,                   2410"
4684,_MARGARET._,"’Tis Manuel’s gift, not mine."
4685,_MARGARET._,
4686,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._ (_taking_).            I have no heart,"
4687,_MARGARET._,"Margaret, for what is done on my behalf."
4688,_MARGARET._,"I thank him, but ..."
4689,_MARGARET._,
4690,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._               Alas, alas! Giovanni:"
4691,_MARGARET._,I looked to find thee glad of heart and happy.
4692,_MARGARET._,"Our troubles all are over. Manuel lives,"
4693,_MARGARET._,"Whom we thought drowned: Constance, who lay in death,"
4694,_MARGARET._,Hath risen from her bed: and even our marriage
4695,_MARGARET._,Is furthered by my brother. How can it be
4696,_MARGARET._,"Thou art so dismal, and thy kiss as cold"
4697,_MARGARET._,As is this prison?
4698,_MARGARET._,
4699,_MARGARET._,_Pal._             I would not leave this prison.               2420
4700,_MARGARET._,
4701,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ Thou wouldst not leave it?
4702,_MARGARET._,
4703,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                            No: dankness and darkness
4704,_MARGARET._,Are now my friends. I have failed. How can I wish
4705,_MARGARET._,To step in the light of heaven?
4706,_MARGARET._,
4707,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                          O, then I see"
4708,_MARGARET._,This death-delivering dungeon hath o’ercome thee.
4709,_MARGARET._,——There’s news. This morn the ships arrived from Spain.
4710,_MARGARET._,They must bring tidings of the king’s accession.
4711,_MARGARET._,"We shall learn all to-day. When he’s proclaimed,"
4712,_MARGARET._,There’s nought that thou couldst do if thou wert free.
4713,_MARGARET._,What thou hast done may have determined much.
4714,_MARGARET._,
4715,_MARGARET._,_Pal._ When shall I hear of it?
4716,_MARGARET._,
4717,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                          Love, thou must sail            2430"
4718,_MARGARET._,Quickly and secretly: and canst not hear
4719,_MARGARET._,Until thou come to land. But then if I
4720,_MARGARET._,"Should meet thee there with Manuel, oh, what joy,"
4721,_MARGARET._,Could I be first to tell thee.
4722,_MARGARET._,
4723,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                         Dost thou think
4724,_MARGARET._,That Manuel hath forgiven me for the wrong
4725,_MARGARET._,"I did him, stealing from his house by night?"
4726,_MARGARET._,
4727,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ That was my theft, Giovanni; and he forgives:"
4728,_MARGARET._,"Cry not thou forfeit.—See, I bring thy dagger."
4729,_MARGARET._,
4730,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._ But, Margaret, I wronged thee too. I fled"
4731,_MARGARET._,From thee; canst thou forgive me?
4732,_MARGARET._,
4733,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                            Ask not me                    2440
4734,_MARGARET._,"If I have forgiven. Hearken, I will tell thee,—"
4735,_MARGARET._,"This dagger is the dagger which the woman,"
4736,_MARGARET._,"Whose name thou didst not know, brought thee in prison:"
4737,_MARGARET._,By help of this thou madest thy first escape.
4738,_MARGARET._,"’Tis I that bring it now. These two days past,"
4739,_MARGARET._,"These days of misery, I have held and worn it"
4740,_MARGARET._,"But for one purpose; that if thou shouldst die,"
4741,_MARGARET._,I might have something which had once been thine
4742,_MARGARET._,To end my life with.
4743,_MARGARET._,
4744,_MARGARET._,_Pal._               Thou!
4745,_MARGARET._,
4746,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                     Ay. I had promised
4747,_MARGARET._,This caseless blade my empty heart for sheath.                  2450
4748,_MARGARET._,
4749,_MARGARET._,_Pal._ Margaret!
4750,_MARGARET._,
4751,_MARGARET._,_Mar._           Now take it. I have better hope.
4752,_MARGARET._,
4753,_MARGARET._,"[_Palicio takes dagger, and puts it in his breast._"
4754,_MARGARET._,
4755,_MARGARET._,Thou shouldst be armed.
4756,_MARGARET._,
4757,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                  And thou hast thought of death?
4758,_MARGARET._,
4759,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ Only if thou hadst died.
4760,_MARGARET._,
4761,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._                          O, Margaret,"
4762,_MARGARET._,"Margaret, I am not worthy of thy love."
4763,_MARGARET._,Thou seest I am not. Look how poor a heart
4764,_MARGARET._,I bring to take thee: ’tis too base. I thought
4765,_MARGARET._,"I loved thee overmuch. Now, fool, I see"
4766,_MARGARET._,I love too little.
4767,_MARGARET._,
4768,_MARGARET._,_Mar._             ’Tis this hateful prison
4769,_MARGARET._,Hath chilled thy spirits. When again thou’rt free
4770,_MARGARET._,Thou’lt be Giovanni.
4771,_MARGARET._,
4772,_MARGARET._,_Pal._               Canst thou love me so?                     2460
4773,_MARGARET._,
4774,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ O, what hath come to thee? Did I not love"
4775,_MARGARET._,The hour I bound thy wound: the day I brought
4776,_MARGARET._,"Rosso to heal thee, and led thee by the hand,"
4777,_MARGARET._,"Threading the blindest midnight silently,"
4778,_MARGARET._,To set thee free? Dost thou forget?
4779,_MARGARET._,
4780,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._                              But then,"
4781,_MARGARET._,"Then I was brave, a leader of the people"
4782,_MARGARET._,Against their tyrant: thou didst hold of me
4783,_MARGARET._,"As of a hero: now I have failed, I am shamed."
4784,_MARGARET._,
4785,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ O no, Giovanni; thou mistakest sadly"
4786,_MARGARET._,My love for thee.
4787,_MARGARET._,
4788,_MARGARET._,_Pal._            I am no more myself.                          2470
4789,_MARGARET._,
4790,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ Then dare I prove to thee how much I love thee,"
4791,_MARGARET._,"How little thy renown. Remember, thou didst scheme"
4792,_MARGARET._,To burn the palace.
4793,_MARGARET._,
4794,_MARGARET._,_Pal._              Ay.
4795,_MARGARET._,
4796,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                  Didst thou not promise
4797,_MARGARET._,"Me, trembling for thy life, that if that failed,"
4798,_MARGARET._,Thou wouldst to Rome with me?
4799,_MARGARET._,
4800,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                        My scheme miscarried:
4801,_MARGARET._,I broke my promise.
4802,_MARGARET._,
4803,_MARGARET._,_Mar._              The cause of that miscarriage
4804,_MARGARET._,Was the betrayal?
4805,_MARGARET._,
4806,_MARGARET._,_Pal._            How should I forget?
4807,_MARGARET._,
4808,_MARGARET._,_Mar._ Now wilt thou say I love but thy success?
4809,_MARGARET._,’Twas I betrayed thy men.
4810,_MARGARET._,
4811,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                    Ha! thou was’t! was’t thou?
4812,_MARGARET._,
4813,_MARGARET._,"(_Leaping up from Margaret, who staggers against the wall._)"
4814,_MARGARET._,
4815,_MARGARET._,"From me, sorceress, thou viper, go from me!                     2480"
4816,_MARGARET._,"Traitress, was’t thou? Thou wast my secret curse!"
4817,_MARGARET._,"Sent by the devil, wast thou, to destroy me,"
4818,_MARGARET._,To kill my soul? And bringest now thy money
4819,_MARGARET._,
4820,_MARGARET._,[_Strews it about._
4821,_MARGARET._,
4822,_MARGARET._,To buy thy happiness: and of thy love
4823,_MARGARET._,"Pratest, and sayst, _Come forth with me_! With thee?"
4824,_MARGARET._,"Rather all deaths, a thousand deaths of shame,—"
4825,_MARGARET._,"The axe, the gallows. O, my faithful men,"
4826,_MARGARET._,My brave men! and for them!—Ah! I will love
4827,_MARGARET._,My executioner more than thee. Love thee!
4828,_MARGARET._,There is not any tyrant or crowned fiend                        2490
4829,_MARGARET._,Whom I will hate like thee.
4830,_MARGARET._,
4831,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._                      Then kill me, Giovanni."
4832,_MARGARET._,
4833,_MARGARET._,[_Swoons falling._
4834,_MARGARET._,
4835,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._ (_taking out dagger_). This dagger in my heart,"
4836,_MARGARET._,and I am avenged.
4837,_MARGARET._,"Nay, nay, O God, I am adding wrong to wrong."
4838,_MARGARET._,
4839,_MARGARET._,[_Putting dagger back._
4840,_MARGARET._,

4843,_MARGARET._,[_Runs to Margaret._
4844,_MARGARET._,
4845,_MARGARET._,"I spake too roughly, Margaret; I was angry:"
4846,_MARGARET._,"I knew not what I said. Margaret, I am sorry."
4847,_MARGARET._,"Forgive me, Margaret. Nay, I meant it not."
4848,_MARGARET._,I am not angry with thee now. I think
4849,_MARGARET._,I can forgive thee. Hear me! She doth not hear me.
4850,_MARGARET._,She doth not breathe. Her eyes are fixed and sightless.         2500
4851,_MARGARET._,Her hands are cold.
4852,_MARGARET._,"My God, oh, if I have killed her! Margaret, Margaret!"
4853,_MARGARET._,Dost thou not hear?—I have killed her.—Margaret!
4854,_MARGARET._,I do forgive thee. I forgive thee all.
4855,_MARGARET._,"O God, she is dead, she is dead.—Now if I kiss her,"
4856,_MARGARET._,"If she can feel (_kissing_). She stirs. O, Margaret,"
4857,_MARGARET._,Hear me. I do forgive thee all.
4858,_MARGARET._,
4859,_MARGARET._,_Mar._                          Giovanni:
4860,_MARGARET._,I did it for thy love.
4861,_MARGARET._,
4862,_MARGARET._,"_Pal._                 Thank God, thank God."
4863,_MARGARET._,"Now thou dost breathe and speak. O, I was cruel;"
4864,_MARGARET._,"I was too angry.—Margaret, forgive me.                          2510"
4865,_MARGARET._,"Kiss me, forgive.                                  [_Noise at door._"
4866,_MARGARET._,

4868,_MARGARET._,’Tis now thy time to fly.
4869,_MARGARET._,
4870,_MARGARET._,_Pal._                                 How can I leave thee?
4871,_MARGARET._,I cannot thus.

4883,_BLASCO._,We shall not separate you yet so far.
4884,_BLASCO._,
4885,_BLASCO._,_Mar._ Ah me!
4886,_BLASCO._,
4887,_BLASCO._,_Pal._        What means this insult?
4888,_BLASCO._,
4889,_BLASCO._,"_Bl._                                 Forward, fellows."
4890,_BLASCO._,"Take ye the lady to the cell I shewed,"

4984,_PHILIP._,What should I say?
4985,_PHILIP._,
4986,_PHILIP._,_Ph._              I’ll tell thee: and thou must know
4987,_PHILIP._,"First, that I once was Manuel’s friend and pupil,—"
4988,_PHILIP._,"My pride, alas! self-wrested to my shame—"
4989,_PHILIP._,"And in those early days loved her, whom he"
4990,_PHILIP._,Should at this time have married. Five years spent

4996,_PHILIP._,"Chance sent me hither, and her presence soon"

4998,_PHILIP._,"Then vainly felt I worthier than I was,"
4999,_PHILIP._,Seeing my better part desired to win
5000,_PHILIP._,What I too surely had deserved to lose.
5001,_PHILIP._,Constance denied me:—but now hear my crime.
5002,_PHILIP._,"I won her father’s ear; and then, being lodged"
5003,_PHILIP._,"In Manuel’s house, I lit on a discovery"
5004,_PHILIP._,"Of some suspicion, and contrived thereby—"
5005,_PHILIP._,Betraying him who was my friend and host—                       2580
5006,_PHILIP._,His absence and disgrace: whence by ill fate
5007,_PHILIP._,His death and all this lady’s trouble sprung.

5010,_PHILIP._,
5011,_PHILIP._,_Ph._                            I was misled
5012,_PHILIP._,To think he loved the lady less than I.
5013,_PHILIP._,"Yet urge I no excuse, nor look for pardon:"
5014,_PHILIP._,"But if ’twould not add sorrow to her sorrow,"
5015,_PHILIP._,I would discharge this burden from my soul.

5274,_OFFICER._,"For anger shewn against me, now I ask                           2701"
5275,_OFFICER._,Thy pardon; and for wrongs against me done
5276,_OFFICER._,"Assure thee, that if freely thou make over"
5277,_OFFICER._,"Thy daughter for my wife, there is in my love"
5278,_OFFICER._,Means for full reconcilement. May I say
5279,_OFFICER._,Constance is mine?
5280,_OFFICER._,
5281,_OFFICER._,_Hu._              I see that she is thine.
5282,_OFFICER._,
5283,_OFFICER._,_Man._ I pray thou never shalt regret this day.
5284,_OFFICER._,
5285,_OFFICER._,"_Ph._ (_returning from window_). There is John Palicio,"
5286,_OFFICER._,with half the town
5287,_OFFICER._,At their old cries. I can make nothing of him.
5288,_OFFICER._,
5289,_OFFICER._,_Man._ Bid him surrender as my prisoner.                        2710
5290,_OFFICER._,I will receive him here.
5291,_OFFICER._,
5292,_OFFICER._,_Hu._                    Thou must not think
5293,_OFFICER._,He comes at asking thus.
5294,_OFFICER._,
5295,_OFFICER._,_Man._                   He will obey.
5296,_OFFICER._,But I will shew myself.                            [_Goes to window._
5297,_OFFICER._,
5298,_OFFICER._,_Hu._ How comes he out of prison?
5299,_OFFICER._,
5300,_MARGARET._,_MARGARET._
5301,_MARGARET._,
5302,_MARGARET._,That I can tell.
5303,_MARGARET._,"Your secretary Blasco promised me,"
5304,_MARGARET._,Who desired nothing more than the release
5305,_MARGARET._,"Of John Palicio, that he would contrive"
5306,_MARGARET._,"To free him, if on my part I returned"
5307,_MARGARET._,"A certain letter to his hands, wherein,                 [_Shewing._"
5308,_MARGARET._,"As you may read, he had betrayed your person                    2720"
5309,_MARGARET._,"To John Palicio for a price. Then I,"
5310,_MARGARET._,"As holder of this written ransom, came"
5311,_MARGARET._,To see my kinsman freed; when in the dungeon
5312,_MARGARET._,"False Blasco, with two villains and another,"
5313,_MARGARET._,"Who was your son, appeared before us armed:"
5314,_MARGARET._,And thinking there to find Palicio
5315,_MARGARET._,"Defenceless, would have slain him, and forced me"
5316,_MARGARET._,To give them back this writing: but Palicio
5317,_MARGARET._,"Sprang up, slew Blasco, and escaped."
5318,_MARGARET._,
5319,_MARGARET._,_Ph._                                His death
5320,_MARGARET._,Was due from me.
5321,_MARGARET._,
5322,_MARGARET._,"_Hu._            Give me the letter, pray.                      2730"
5323,_MARGARET._,"Say, Livio, is this true?"
5324,_MARGARET._,
5325,_MARGARET._,_Liv._                    I never knew
5326,_MARGARET._,"Of this betrayal, sir; I trusted Blasco."
5327,_MARGARET._,
5328,_MARGARET._,"_Mar._ He counts for nothing, since he ran away."
5329,_MARGARET._,
5330,_MARGARET._,_Enter Palicio._
5331,_MARGARET._,
5332,_MARGARET._,_Hu._ Is this the man?
5333,_MARGARET._,
5334,_MARGARET._,_Man._                 Thou art my prisoner.
5335,_MARGARET._,
5336,_PALICIO._,_PALICIO._
5337,_PALICIO._,
5338,_PALICIO._,I make submission to your excellence.
5339,_PALICIO._,
5340,_PALICIO._,[_Offering (Blasco’s) sword._
5341,_PALICIO._,
5342,_PALICIO._,_Man._ Dost thou surrender of thy own free-will
5343,_PALICIO._,"To me, as legal viceroy of this island,"
5344,_PALICIO._,"Under King Frederick, and now abjuring"
5345,_PALICIO._,"Thy late rebellion, wilt thou trust henceforth"
5346,_PALICIO._,The people’s welfare to my lawful hands?                        2740
5347,_PALICIO._,
5348,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ I do, and all will trust thee as do I."
5349,_PALICIO._,
5350,_PALICIO._,_Man._ That is thy pardon. (_Takes sword._) For the king’s good will
5351,_PALICIO._,Is grace to all. Yet there will be for thee
5352,_PALICIO._,Question in Blasco’s death. But now I need
5353,_PALICIO._,"Elsewhere thy presence. (_Returning sword._) Go forth to the people,"
5354,_PALICIO._,And make it known that I am their governour:
5355,_PALICIO._,And that for all disorder ere this day
5356,_PALICIO._,"There will be pardon, but from this day none."
5357,_PALICIO._,Bid them disperse.
5358,_PALICIO._,
5359,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._             Those hundred men of mine,"
5360,_PALICIO._,Who lie in prison: is their pardon granted?                     2750
5361,_PALICIO._,
5362,_PALICIO._,_Mar._ ’Tis I should plead for them. ’Twas I betrayed them.
5363,_PALICIO._,
5364,_PALICIO._,_Hu._ Thou didst betray them?
5365,_PALICIO._,
5366,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                        Ay, sir."
5367,_PALICIO._,
5368,_PALICIO._,_Hu._                                  ’Tis nought but wonder.
5369,_PALICIO._,
5370,_PALICIO._,_Man._ (_to Pal._). This is a day of grace. None will resent
5371,_PALICIO._,"Our stretching mercy. I shall grant their pardon,"
5372,_PALICIO._,But not without some cautions; for among them—
5373,_PALICIO._,"Hear me, Palicio, thou who so dost cry"
5374,_PALICIO._,Against the taxes—many among thy men
5375,_PALICIO._,Are a most burdensome and fruitless tax.
5376,_PALICIO._,"They go free but to work, and with such measures"
5377,_PALICIO._,As will ensure it.                             [_Palicio is going._
5378,_PALICIO._,"Now, sir, ere thou goest,                    2760"
5379,_PALICIO._,Is there none here to whom a word is due?
5380,_PALICIO._,
5381,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ O, Manuel, I dare not, nay,—I pray thee,"
5382,_PALICIO._,Be not too generous towards me: since my heart
5383,_PALICIO._,"Has fallen so far, let me have trial yet"
5384,_PALICIO._,"That I may win what I but falsely stole,"
5385,_PALICIO._,"And now would leave in thy security,"
5386,_PALICIO._,Till I may bring some right to claim it. Yet
5387,_PALICIO._,I lack the worth to ask. But there’s one thing
5388,_PALICIO._,"Which I will ask (_goes to Margaret_), forgiveness; and"
5389,_PALICIO._,for that
5390,_PALICIO._,I kneel.
5391,_PALICIO._,
5392,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._   I will not hide it from thee, sir,                     2770"
5393,_PALICIO._,"That in the mutual interchange of pardons,"
5394,_PALICIO._,"Which is our friendly game, I have had some pain"
5395,_PALICIO._,"Standing out in the cold, merely for lack"
5396,_PALICIO._,Of such a suit as thine. I have looked and longed
5397,_PALICIO._,To find a debtor; and I will take thee.
5398,_PALICIO._,"Rise, sir. I must present thee to a kinsman."
5399,_PALICIO._,
5400,_PALICIO._,[_Leads Palicio to Hugo._
5401,_PALICIO._,
5402,_PALICIO._,"(_To Hugo._) Do you remember, sir, a cruel saying"
5403,_PALICIO._,Spoken to me against this gentleman?
5404,_PALICIO._,"Since that I have been his friend, ay, and yours too,"
5405,_PALICIO._,"For I betrayed his people to your hands,                        2780"
5406,_PALICIO._,When they were setting forth to burn the palace;
5407,_PALICIO._,And so prevented Blasco’s treachery;
5408,_PALICIO._,"From which him too I saved, and for that deed"
5409,_PALICIO._,He takes me now in marriage.
5410,_PALICIO._,
5411,_PALICIO._,_Hu._                        All thou sayst
5412,_PALICIO._,"Margaret, with much of what hath happed to-day"
5413,_PALICIO._,Needs explanation. I must see so far
5414,_PALICIO._,That Livio by his conduct is cut off:
5415,_PALICIO._,But if you tell me now that you will marry
5416,_PALICIO._,This man ...
5417,_PALICIO._,
5418,_PALICIO._,"_Man._       Palicio is of noble blood,"
5419,_PALICIO._,My lord. Yourself have given him oft such praise
5420,_PALICIO._,As by an enemy must be well deserved                            2791
5421,_PALICIO._,Ere it be spoken. The king’s pardon proves
5422,_PALICIO._,Justification: he is quit of treason.
5423,_PALICIO._,"We shall restore his rank, the loss of which,"
5424,_PALICIO._,"Due to his grandsire in the civil wars,"
5425,_PALICIO._,"Brings him no stain: nay, we shall further make him"
5426,_PALICIO._,"Chief secretary, where his ancient zeal"
5427,_PALICIO._,For all the commons’ rights may still be shewn.
5428,_PALICIO._,
5429,_PALICIO._,"_Con._ Margaret, we may be married the same day."
5430,_PALICIO._,
5431,_PALICIO._,"_Hu._ I see indeed this is a day of grace,                      2800"
5432,_PALICIO._,Of wondrous grace: and where I take so much
5433,_PALICIO._,I should be churlish did I not rejoice
5434,_PALICIO._,That I may rank behind no one of you
5435,_PALICIO._,In the free dispensation of my favour.
5436,_PALICIO._,"And there’s one act would set the balance even,"
5437,_PALICIO._,"Lay it even lower against me: it is this,"
5438,_PALICIO._,"For I will do it: John Palicio,"
5439,_PALICIO._,I do forgive thee ...
5440,_PALICIO._,
5441,_PALICIO._,"_Mar._                Now I thank thee, sire."
5442,_PALICIO._,
5443,_PALICIO._,"_Pal._ And I, my lord, who never thought to do it,"
5444,_PALICIO._,Will forgive thee. DO YOU FORGIVE US ALL.                       2810

5627,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ Nought.                                                    110
5628,_ATHENA._,
5629,_ATHENA._,_Ath._        Look!
5630,_ATHENA._,
5631,_ATHENA._,_Ul._               I see nought. ’Tis a thicker mist
5632,_ATHENA._,Than ever in my own cloud-gathering isle
5633,_ATHENA._,"Clung to the frowning cliffs, when the warm south"
5634,_ATHENA._,Beat up the vapours from the seas at morn.
5635,_ATHENA._,
5636,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ Look.
5637,_ATHENA._,
5638,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._        Now it brightens somewhat, or mine eye"
5639,_ATHENA._,Wearies with vainly poring on the dark.
5640,_ATHENA._,
5641,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ Look.
5642,_ATHENA._,
5643,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._        Ay, the vapours lift, the highlands loom,"
5644,_ATHENA._,The air obeys thee: thro’ its thinning veils
5645,_ATHENA._,The figure of some mountain jags the sky;
5646,_ATHENA._,"And those should be my hills: ’tis Neritos,"
5647,_ATHENA._,’Tis Ithaca indeed.
5648,_ATHENA._,
5649,_ATHENA._,_Ath._              ’Tis Ithaca.                                 120
5650,_ATHENA._,
5651,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ O Blessed Light, that unto all men’s eyes"
5652,_ATHENA._,Shewest the lands and waters: that uprisest
5653,_ATHENA._,Day after day upon the windy seas
5654,_ATHENA._,"And fertile plains, valleys and lovely hills,"
5655,_ATHENA._,"Rivers and shores, and heights and peopled towns;"
5656,_ATHENA._,Now in all Greece is no tongue praiseth thee
5657,_ATHENA._,"As mine, nor heart thanketh; nor any eye"
5658,_ATHENA._,Rejoicest thou as mine.
5659,_ATHENA._,
5660,_ATHENA._,_Ath._                  Turn now to left.
5661,_ATHENA._,"There is the haven of Phorcys, here the tree,"
5662,_ATHENA._,Thy well-remembered olive; and to right                          130
5663,_ATHENA._,"The rock-roofed cave, where thou so oft hast done"
5664,_ATHENA._,Sweet sacrifice unto the native Nymphs.
5665,_ATHENA._,
5666,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ Soil of my dear-desirèd fatherland,"
5667,_ATHENA._,"For warrant that I dream not, take this kiss;"
5668,_ATHENA._,"My home! And ye, dear sisters of the spring,"
5669,_ATHENA._,"I raise my hands to you, whom nevermore"
5670,_ATHENA._,"I looked to greet; but now, children of heaven,"
5671,_ATHENA._,"As once of old I praise you, and henceforth"
5672,_ATHENA._,"Will pay with loving vows, if your fair queen"
5673,_ATHENA._,"But grant me life, and comfort in my son.                        140"
5674,_ATHENA._,
5675,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ Now thou believest.
5676,_ATHENA._,
5677,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._                      See, there be the firs,"
5678,_ATHENA._,Which eastward of my house bar the red dawn
5679,_ATHENA._,"With black, and in their feathery tops at night"
5680,_ATHENA._,"Sigh to the moon. Ay, and my house I see"
5681,_ATHENA._,Unchanged. ’Tis Ithaca.
5682,_ATHENA._,
5683,_ATHENA._,_Ath._                  Wilt thou not go
5684,_ATHENA._,"Now to thy home, and with the sweet surprise"
5685,_ATHENA._,"Of thy desired return gladden thy wife,"
5686,_ATHENA._,"And greet thy son, a man, whom thou didst leave"
5687,_ATHENA._,"In cradle? See, I here will guard thy goods."
5688,_ATHENA._,Thou wouldst be gone.
5689,_ATHENA._,
5690,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._                 Goddess, if strong desire                  150"
5691,_ATHENA._,"Could ever conquer me, now should I do"
5692,_ATHENA._,"A thing for which no man might blame me, nay"
5693,_ATHENA._,"Even tho’ he pitied me, if too great longing"
5694,_ATHENA._,Should fool me to my ruin. But in my heart
5695,_ATHENA._,Are other thoughts. The wife of Agamemnon
5696,_ATHENA._,"At his return welcomed the king with state,"
5697,_ATHENA._,"And to his chamber led, but in the bath"
5698,_ATHENA._,"Soon as he lay, giving him honied words,"
5699,_ATHENA._,"She slew him with a dagger, to the deed"
5700,_ATHENA._,"Being prompted by her guilty paramour,                           160"
5701,_ATHENA._,Ægisthus. Ten years numbered since that crime
5702,_ATHENA._,Double the equal motive of my fear:
5703,_ATHENA._,"Nor can a woman, when her lord, tho’ loved,"
5704,_ATHENA._,"Is long away, be trusted, that she should not"
5705,_ATHENA._,In weariness at last forsake her faith.
5706,_ATHENA._,"Wherefore I would not enter in my house,"
5707,_ATHENA._,"Nay, nor be known of any, till I hear"
5708,_ATHENA._,Such tidings as bespeak my coming well.
5709,_ATHENA._,
5710,_ATHENA._,"_Ath._ O brave! thy wary mind has gone before,"
5711,_ATHENA._,The way I would have led it: thou art as ever                    170
5712,_ATHENA._,"Fore-reckoner with chance, to take thy stand"
5713,_ATHENA._,Armed at all points.
5714,_ATHENA._,
5715,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._                This fear, goddess, I learnt"
5716,_ATHENA._,"Of blind Tiresias, when at Circe’s bidding"
5717,_ATHENA._,"I sailed for south beyond the coasts of men,"
5718,_ATHENA._,"To dark Cimmerian cloud-land, and I saw"
5719,_ATHENA._,"The hapless king himself, who with thin voice"
5720,_ATHENA._,"Poured forth his wrongs; and many more I saw,"
5721,_ATHENA._,Who suffered pain: the tearful shadows penned
5722,_ATHENA._,In mansions of austere Persephonè.
5723,_ATHENA._,From that old prophet’s tongue of warning weird                  180
5724,_ATHENA._,"Still for myself in the end I gathered hope,"
5725,_ATHENA._,"And treasured it, but from thy tongue fear ill."
5726,_ATHENA._,
5727,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ Yet shouldst thou cherish all the words he spake.
5728,_ATHENA._,
5729,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ I ask not now what shall be, but what is."
5730,_ATHENA._,Beneath yon roof what passes? Thou canst give
5731,_ATHENA._,Present assurance. Tell me then. My wife—
5732,_ATHENA._,She is well?
5733,_ATHENA._,
5734,_ATHENA._,_Ath._       And beautiful.
5735,_ATHENA._,
5736,_ATHENA._,_Ul._                       Faithful?
5737,_ATHENA._,
5738,_ATHENA._,_Ath._                                And brave.
5739,_ATHENA._,
5740,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ My son Telemachus?
5741,_ATHENA._,
5742,_ATHENA._,_Ath._                   He too is well.
5743,_ATHENA._,
5744,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ Great are the gods in heaven! I need no more.
5745,_ATHENA._,"Thee, Goddess, will I worship while I live.                      190"
5746,_ATHENA._,
5747,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ And much thou needest me yet. Hark while I tell.
5748,_ATHENA._,Three years thy house hath been the hostelry
5749,_ATHENA._,"Of dissolute and shameless men, the lords"
5750,_ATHENA._,And princes of the isles and western shores;
5751,_ATHENA._,"Who woo thy wife, and feasting in thy halls"
5752,_ATHENA._,Make waste of all thy substance day and night.
5753,_ATHENA._,"As men besiege a city, and their host"
5754,_ATHENA._,"Encamp about and let none out nor in,"
5755,_ATHENA._,"Waiting the day when hunger and sore need,"
5756,_ATHENA._,"Sharper than iron and cruder than fire,                          200"
5757,_ATHENA._,Shall bow the starvèd necks beneath the yoke:
5758,_ATHENA._,So sit they there: and ’mong them is an oath
5759,_ATHENA._,That none will leave till one be satisfied;
5760,_ATHENA._,Whoe’er it be that in the end shall take
5761,_ATHENA._,"Thy fair wife, and thy house and goods and lands;"
5762,_ATHENA._,"Which false and covetous oath, since all have shared,"
5763,_ATHENA._,Must be the death of all.
5764,_ATHENA._,
5765,_ATHENA._,_Ul._                     Now with thine aid
5766,_ATHENA._,"Shall they be scattered, were their cursed swarm"
5767,_ATHENA._,"Thick as the rooks, which from his new-sown fields"
5768,_ATHENA._,"The husbandman a moment stays to scare,                          210"
5769,_ATHENA._,Raising both hands.
5770,_ATHENA._,
5771,_ATHENA._,_Ath._              Not so may they escape.
5772,_ATHENA._,"Better thou hadst not now returned, if one"
5773,_ATHENA._,Of all these men avoid his destined death.
5774,_ATHENA._,
5775,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ How say’st thou, goddess, shall these men be slain?"
5776,_ATHENA._,
5777,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ How were Ulysses’ foes then wont to die?
5778,_ATHENA._,
5779,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ It may not be.
5780,_ATHENA._,
5781,_ATHENA._,_Ath._               Thou wert not used to fear.
5782,_ATHENA._,
5783,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ Nay, but returned from exile and hard war,"
5784,_ATHENA._,I would not usher battle in my home.
5785,_ATHENA._,
5786,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ Think’st thou of peace? Hadst thou but hence been stayed
5787,_ATHENA._,So long as shall suffice yon dying moon                          220
5788,_ATHENA._,"To launch her young bark on the western sea,"
5789,_ATHENA._,Then had Penelope no more been thine.
5790,_ATHENA._,
5791,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ Thou saidst that she was faithful.
5792,_ATHENA._,
5793,_ATHENA._,_Ath._                                   She withstands
5794,_ATHENA._,The urgence of the wooers day by day;
5795,_ATHENA._,"But ’gainst herself, to save thy house from loss,"
5796,_ATHENA._,"Deeming thee dead indeed, now falls to yield."
5797,_ATHENA._,
5798,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ Vengeance upon them! Grant me but thine aid,"
5799,_ATHENA._,And though they count by hundreds they shall die.
5800,_ATHENA._,
5801,_ATHENA._,"_Ath._ If one escape, his joy will be for thine."
5802,_ATHENA._,
5803,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ All shall be slain, though ’twere a task too heavy         230"
5804,_ATHENA._,For great Alcides. But my son in this
5805,_ATHENA._,Should stand with me. May I not see him first?
5806,_ATHENA._,"Shall he not know me, and, in that embrace"
5807,_ATHENA._,"I yearn for, knit his willing strength with mine?"
5808,_ATHENA._,
5809,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ Telemachus hath lately at my bidding
5810,_ATHENA._,"Sailed hence to Lacedæmon, there to inquire"
5811,_ATHENA._,What might be learnt of thee.
5812,_ATHENA._,
5813,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._                         Was this well done,"
5814,_ATHENA._,"Or kindly of thee, who couldst have told him all:"
5815,_ATHENA._,"To send him far, upon a useless errand,"
5816,_ATHENA._,"Out of my sight, the eve of my return?                           240"
5817,_ATHENA._,
5818,_ATHENA._,"_Ath._ I sent him for his safety, there to win"
5819,_ATHENA._,"Opinion too of such as knew him not,"
5820,_ATHENA._,And rouse remembrance of thee in the world.
5821,_ATHENA._,To-day is he returned: I have brought his ship
5822,_ATHENA._,"North of the island, as was need, to shun"
5823,_ATHENA._,The wooers’ galley sent to take him; there
5824,_ATHENA._,Is he disbarked alone. Thou mayst be first
5825,_ATHENA._,To meet him.
5826,_ATHENA._,
5827,_ATHENA._,_Ul._        Lead me thither.
5828,_ATHENA._,
5829,_ATHENA._,_Ath._                        Ah! thou forgettest.
5830,_ATHENA._,If any one but he should see thy face?—
5831,_ATHENA._,
5832,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ Contrive then that I meet with him alone.                  250
5833,_ATHENA._,
5834,_ATHENA._,"_Ath._ How if my plot were better, so that all"
5835,_ATHENA._,"Might see thee, yet none know thee but thy son?"
5836,_ATHENA._,
5837,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ What manner of disguise is in thy thought?
5838,_ATHENA._,
5839,_ATHENA._,"_Ath._ Disfigurement, which thou mayst shrink to bear."
5840,_ATHENA._,
5841,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ Ay, if my son behold me ill transformed."
5842,_ATHENA._,
5843,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ Yet he alone shall see thee as thou art.
5844,_ATHENA._,
5845,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ Then tell me, goddess, what thou wouldst: thou knowest"
5846,_ATHENA._,Playing another’s part I am most myself.                         258
5847,_ATHENA._,
5848,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ But I will make thee now least like thyself.
5849,_ATHENA._,
5850,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ How! shall I stoop then to be less than man?
5851,_ATHENA._,
5852,_ATHENA._,"_Ath._ Nay, but of men the vilest, though a man."
5853,_ATHENA._,"For that thou mayst be hidden, lo! I will change"
5854,_ATHENA._,Thy outward seeming to the piteous aspect
5855,_ATHENA._,Of age and beggary. Thy supple skin
5856,_ATHENA._,"I’ll wrinkle on thy joints, thy thick brown hair"
5857,_ATHENA._,"Rob from thy head, and dim thy radiant eyes,"
5858,_ATHENA._,"And o’er thy shoulders bowed cast sorry rags,"
5859,_ATHENA._,To make thee loathed of men. In such disguise
5860,_ATHENA._,"Mayst thou in safety seek thy herdsman’s hut,"
5861,_ATHENA._,"Eumæus: he is faithful, and with kindness                        270"
5862,_ATHENA._,"Will serve thee as a stranger in distress,"
5863,_ATHENA._,No less than he will welcome thee revealed.
5864,_ATHENA._,"Accept his food and shelter, and the while"
5865,_ATHENA._,"Learn from his lips what friends thou hast to look for,"
5866,_ATHENA._,"What foes to reckon with, what wrongs to avenge;"
5867,_ATHENA._,"And humour as thou wilt his honest ears,"
5868,_ATHENA._,Awaiting till I thither send thy son.
5869,_ATHENA._,
5870,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ When wilt thou send him?
5871,_ATHENA._,
5872,_ATHENA._,_Ath._                         He will come ere noon.
5873,_ATHENA._,
5874,_ATHENA._,_Ul._ Then must he first behold me thus deformed?
5875,_ATHENA._,
5876,_ATHENA._,_Ath._ He cannot know thee. Thou betray thyself
5877,_ATHENA._,No whit; I will be near and make occasion                        281
5878,_ATHENA._,"To shew thee to him, as thou art, alone."
5879,_ATHENA._,
5880,_ATHENA._,"_Ul._ I have had no hope, goddess, but in thine aid:"
5881,_ATHENA._,Long as that tarried I despaired not then;
5882,_ATHENA._,"How should I, when thou comest, deny thee now?"
5883,_ATHENA._,
5884,_ATHENA._,"_Ath._ Then first unto the cave, therein to stow"
5885,_ATHENA._,These goods; and after by this olive trunk
5886,_ATHENA._,Sit we awhile together: when thou hast heard
5887,_ATHENA._,"My counsel, I will work this change upon thee,"
5888,_ATHENA._,"That one who saw thee now of kingly port,                        290"
5889,_ATHENA._,"Hale and well-liking, ay, and bowed the head,"
5890,_ATHENA._,"Should, when he next saw, spurn thee with his foot;"
5891,_ATHENA._,"Thus must it be. Come, let us to the cave."

5974,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._                             Nay, there’s the meat;"
5975,_ULYSSES._,I’ll fetch it thee.                                        [_Exit._
5976,_ULYSSES._,
5977,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._               Was ever sound on earth
5978,_ULYSSES._,So musical as the remembered voice
5979,_ULYSSES._,"That welcomes home? By heaven, ’twas yesterday"
5980,_ULYSSES._,"That I was here. No change at all: this bench,"
5981,_ULYSSES._,This board:—the very hogs might be the same.
5982,_ULYSSES._,"O my good bread and wine! And here’s his loaf,"
5983,_ULYSSES._,"The shape he ever made; and cut the same,                        360"
5984,_ULYSSES._,"Scooped to the thumb. Hail, grape of Ithaca!"
5985,_ULYSSES._,Good day to thee! (_Drinks._)
5986,_ULYSSES._,
5987,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ (_re-entering_). See, here is meat in plenty:"
5988,_ULYSSES._,Fall to and spare not.
5989,_ULYSSES._,
5990,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._                  Thank thee, sir; I thank thee."
5991,_ULYSSES._,
5992,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Art thou of Ithaca, old man?"
5993,_ULYSSES._,
5994,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._                               Nay, sir;"
5995,_ULYSSES._,Indeed I am not.
5996,_ULYSSES._,
5997,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._           When cam’st thou then among us?
5998,_ULYSSES._,
5999,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ With this day’s sun I first beheld your isle.
6000,_ULYSSES._,
6001,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._ Eh! hath a ship arrived so late in harbour?
6002,_ULYSSES._,Whence hails she?
6003,_ULYSSES._,
6004,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._             From Thesprotia coasting south;
6005,_ULYSSES._,But driven far out to sea in beating back
6006,_ULYSSES._,Put in for water; when the notion took me                        370
6007,_ULYSSES._,"To leave her, and pursue my own starvation"
6008,_ULYSSES._,Without the risk of drowning.
6009,_ULYSSES._,
6010,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._                        And how then
6011,_ULYSSES._,Cam’st thou aboard a vessel so ill-found?
6012,_ULYSSES._,
6013,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ My tale were long, sir, should I once begin:"
6014,_ULYSSES._,"And since I have seen no food since yestermorn,"
6015,_ULYSSES._,Believe I’d lend thee ear rather than mouth.
6016,_ULYSSES._,
6017,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Ay, so, no fool, and I was but a churl"
6018,_ULYSSES._,"To bid thee talk and eat: eat, sir, in peace."
6019,_ULYSSES._,
6020,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ I pray thee while I eat tell of thyself,"
6021,_ULYSSES._,"Whom here thou servest, and who rules this isle.                 380"
6022,_ULYSSES._,
6023,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ I am a servant, sir, that hath no master:"
6024,_ULYSSES._,These swine I tend are no man’s: those I kill
6025,_ULYSSES._,I kill for any one; for on this isle
6026,_ULYSSES._,We pay our service to a gap between
6027,_ULYSSES._,A grandsire and a grandchild. Dost thou take me?
6028,_ULYSSES._,
6029,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ Yes, friend: thy master is away or dead."
6030,_ULYSSES._,
6031,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Both as I think. The while, for lack of tidings,"
6032,_ULYSSES._,"We make believe he lives. His ancient father,"
6033,_ULYSSES._,"Decrepit and despairing, lies aloof,—"
6034,_ULYSSES._,"We call him king no longer;—and his son,                         390"
6035,_ULYSSES._,"The old man’s grandchild, is away on quest"
6036,_ULYSSES._,Of any tidings to be gleaned from those
6037,_ULYSSES._,Who years agone fought with his sire at Troy.
6038,_ULYSSES._,"His widow keeps his house, and hath in hand"
6039,_ULYSSES._,Some five or six score suitors. Judge from this
6040,_ULYSSES._,What hope hath beggary in Ithaca.
6041,_ULYSSES._,
6042,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ In all my wanderings never have I found
6043,_ULYSSES._,"A kinder host. But since thou sayest thy master,"
6044,_ULYSSES._,"Whose absence makes thee masterless, was one"
6045,_ULYSSES._,"Who fought at Troy, I too was in that war;                       400"
6046,_ULYSSES._,"If thou wouldst tell his name, I may know somewhat"
6047,_ULYSSES._,To cheer his wife and child.
6048,_ULYSSES._,
6049,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._                       Try not that talk,"
6050,_ULYSSES._,Old man. No more of him shall traveller hither
6051,_ULYSSES._,Come bringing tidings that may win their ear.
6052,_ULYSSES._,Lightly indeed for welcome’s sake will vagrants
6053,_ULYSSES._,"Speak false, nor have they cause to wish for truth."
6054,_ULYSSES._,"Nay, and there’s none strays to this isle, but goes"
6055,_ULYSSES._,"Seeking my mistress, and there spins his lie;"
6056,_ULYSSES._,"While she with tender care asks of each thing,"
6057,_ULYSSES._,"And from her sorrowing eyes the tears fall fast,                 410"
6058,_ULYSSES._,Hearing the name she doth not dare to speak.
6059,_ULYSSES._,"And soon enough wouldst thou too coin thy tale,"
6060,_ULYSSES._,Couldst thou but win a blanket for thy back:
6061,_ULYSSES._,The while for him vultures and wolves are like
6062,_ULYSSES._,"To have stripped his bones of flesh—ay, ay, he is dead—"
6063,_ULYSSES._,"Or fish have preyed upon him, and his ribs"
6064,_ULYSSES._,"Bleach on the sea-shore, sunk in drifting sand."
6065,_ULYSSES._,"Such fate is his, grievous to all who loved him,"
6066,_ULYSSES._,And most to me; who ne’er shall find again
6067,_ULYSSES._,"So kind a lord, wherever I may go:                               420"
6068,_ULYSSES._,Not even again if home to father and mother
6069,_ULYSSES._,"I should return, where I was bred and born."
6070,_ULYSSES._,"Nor are my tears for them, yearn as I do"
6071,_ULYSSES._,"With these eyes to behold them, and my country;"
6072,_ULYSSES._,But my desire is for Ulysses gone:
6073,_ULYSSES._,"Speaking whose name, stranger, tho’ far from hearing"
6074,_ULYSSES._,I do obeisance (_towards Ul._); for he loved me well;
6075,_ULYSSES._,"And worshipful I call him, be he dead."
6076,_ULYSSES._,
6077,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ If ’tis Ulysses, friend, whom thou lamentest,"
6078,_ULYSSES._,I know he lives.
6079,_ULYSSES._,
6080,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._           Try not that tale, I say.                       430"
6081,_ULYSSES._,
6082,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ Now, sir, tho’ thou deny it and think I lie,"
6083,_ULYSSES._,"Ulysses will return, and on that day"
6084,_ULYSSES._,"Give me my due; since I dare call on Zeus,"
6085,_ULYSSES._,"First of the gods, and by this friendly table"
6086,_ULYSSES._,"Swear, and his dear home whither I be come,"
6087,_ULYSSES._,"This thing shall be, and with the running year"
6088,_ULYSSES._,He shall return.
6089,_ULYSSES._,
6090,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._           Nay, ’tis not I shall pay"
6091,_ULYSSES._,"Thy recompense. Content thee, man, and drink."
6092,_ULYSSES._,Why wouldst thou force persuasion? Tell me rather
6093,_ULYSSES._,"Thy own true story, who thou art and whence.                     440"
6094,_ULYSSES._,
6095,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ Would then that thou couldst give me food and wine,"
6096,_ULYSSES._,"Ay, and the gods fair sunshine and no toil,"
6097,_ULYSSES._,The while my tale should last: for on this bench
6098,_ULYSSES._,Would I take comfort of thee many a day.
6099,_ULYSSES._,But of thy lord ...
6100,_ULYSSES._,
6101,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._              Wilt thou not cease from that!
6102,_ULYSSES._,
6103,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ With my own ships I fought at Ilion;
6104,_ULYSSES._,"And tho’ I look not now, in age and rags,"
6105,_ULYSSES._,"A master among men, nay, nor a foe"
6106,_ULYSSES._,"Many would fear, yet mayst thou see on me"
6107,_ULYSSES._,"The sign of what I have been, and I think                        450"
6108,_ULYSSES._,Still from the gratten one may guess the grain.
6109,_ULYSSES._,
6110,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._ (_aside_). How age and misery will brag! And this
6111,_ULYSSES._,"To me, who really am a king."
6112,_ULYSSES._,
6113,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._                        ’Twas then
6114,_ULYSSES._,"I knew Ulysses, and have since, like him"
6115,_ULYSSES._,"And many a Greek, striven against destiny"
6116,_ULYSSES._,To gain my home:—at length our ship was cast
6117,_ULYSSES._,"On mountainous Thesprotia, where the king"
6118,_ULYSSES._,"Pheidon was kind to me, and there I heard—"
6119,_ULYSSES._,Nor yet are many weeks passed since that day—
6120,_ULYSSES._,"Full tidings of Ulysses, and I saw                               460"
6121,_ULYSSES._,What wealth his arm had gotten: he himself
6122,_ULYSSES._,"Was travelled to Dodona, but by this"
6123,_ULYSSES._,Should be returned.
6124,_ULYSSES._,
6125,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._              Stranger, if all thy words,"
6126,_ULYSSES._,"That grow in number, should outreach in tale"
6127,_ULYSSES._,"The moments of his absence, they were vainly"
6128,_ULYSSES._,Poured in mine ears.
6129,_ULYSSES._,
6130,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._                Nay, then, and if indeed"
6131,_ULYSSES._,"Ulysses came himself, here of his friends"
6132,_ULYSSES._,He would not be received.
6133,_ULYSSES._,
6134,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._                    Ay, that may be:"
6135,_ULYSSES._,"And time will change a man so from himself,"
6136,_ULYSSES._,That oft I wonder none have e’er contrived                       470
6137,_ULYSSES._,To make pretence to be Ulysses’ self.
6138,_ULYSSES._,"That were a game for thee, old man, if age"
6139,_ULYSSES._,"Did not so far belie thee. Nay, nay, nay!"
6140,_ULYSSES._,"Signs there would be: and if these eyes should see him,"
6141,_ULYSSES._,"And seeing know not, I would serve them so"
6142,_ULYSSES._,That they should see no more.
6143,_ULYSSES._,
6144,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._                         Now when he comes ...
6145,_ULYSSES._,
6146,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Still harking back! I tell thee, friend, our thought"
6147,_ULYSSES._,"Is rather for his son Telemachus,"
6148,_ULYSSES._,And his return; who when he promised well
6149,_ULYSSES._,"To be his father’s match, went wandering hence                   480"
6150,_ULYSSES._,"To Lacedæmon, seeking for his sire:"
6151,_ULYSSES._,"An idle quest and perilous, for I say"
6152,_ULYSSES._,’Twould much increase the tender love of them
6153,_ULYSSES._,"That woo the mother, could they kill the son,"
6154,_ULYSSES._,And quarrel for the inheritance: and now
6155,_ULYSSES._,"They have sent a ship to take him in the straits,"
6156,_ULYSSES._,As he comes home: but may the gods protect him.
6157,_ULYSSES._,"Tho’, till I see him safe, my heart is vexed."
6158,_ULYSSES._,
6159,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ Fear not; the gods will save him.
6160,_ULYSSES._,
6161,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._                                  Thank thee, sir."
6162,_ULYSSES._,Hast ever been in Sparta?
6163,_ULYSSES._,
6164,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._                     Ask me nought,                         490"
6165,_ULYSSES._,If thou wilt credit nought; or shall I say
6166,_ULYSSES._,"I have never lodged in Pitanè, nor drunk"
6167,_ULYSSES._,"Out of Eurotas, nor on summer noons"
6168,_ULYSSES._,Gazed on the steep sun-checquered precipices
6169,_ULYSSES._,Of huge Taygetus?
6170,_ULYSSES._,
6171,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._            Thy pardon, sir."
6172,_ULYSSES._,Hast eaten well?
6173,_ULYSSES._,
6174,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._            Ay, to content: but, friend,"
6175,_ULYSSES._,I shall not prey upon thee: an hour or two
6176,_ULYSSES._,"I’ll rest me here; then, if thou shew the road"
6177,_ULYSSES._,"To good Ulysses’ house, I’ll e’en be gone."
6178,_ULYSSES._,Food must be there in plenty: I make no doubt                    500
6179,_ULYSSES._,To beg a meal till I may serve for hire.
6180,_ULYSSES._,
6181,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Why, man, what put this folly in thy head?"
6182,_ULYSSES._,"’Twere the short way to end thy days, to go"
6183,_ULYSSES._,"Among that insolent and godless herd,"
6184,_ULYSSES._,To tempt their violence. Not such as thou
6185,_ULYSSES._,Their servants are: they that attend on them
6186,_ULYSSES._,Are young and gaily clad and fair of face:
6187,_ULYSSES._,"And though the polished tables lack not food,"
6188,_ULYSSES._,’Tis not for such as thou the hot feast smokes
6189,_ULYSSES._,"From morn till eve, and the red wine is poured.                  510"
6190,_ULYSSES._,"Bide here; for here thou vexest none, nor me"
6191,_ULYSSES._,"Nor any of my fellows. Bide awhile,"
6192,_ULYSSES._,"And if Telemachus return, I warrant"
6193,_ULYSSES._,"Thou shalt have no complaint. Hark, I hear feet:"
6194,_ULYSSES._,Some one now comes.
6195,_ULYSSES._,
6196,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._               And ’tis a friend; the dogs
6197,_ULYSSES._,"Bark not, but fawn around. (_Aside._) If this be he!"
6198,_ULYSSES._,I dare not rise and look.
6199,_ULYSSES._,
6200,_ULYSSES._,_Enter Telemachus._
6201,_ULYSSES._,
6202,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._                    Why he! ’tis he!
6203,_ULYSSES._,"Telemachus, my son Telemachus,"
6204,_ULYSSES._,Art thou returned in safety?
6205,_ULYSSES._,
6206,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ (_aside._) Praised be the gods! I see my son indeed!
6207,_ULYSSES._,
6208,_ULYSSES._,_TELEMACHUS_ (_to Eum._).
6209,_ULYSSES._,
6210,_ULYSSES._,"You see me, father.                           520"
6211,_ULYSSES._,
6212,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Light of mine eyes, thou’rt come, Telemachus;"
6213,_ULYSSES._,All shall go forward with us once again.
6214,_ULYSSES._,
6215,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ (_aside_). He calls him father, and I may not speak."
6216,_ULYSSES._,
6217,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._ Hath aught been wrong?
6218,_ULYSSES._,
6219,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._                        Nay, nought is changed for that."
6220,_ULYSSES._,’Twas only lack of thee: and with the fear
6221,_ULYSSES._,"Some ill might hap to thee, what dost thou think"
6222,_ULYSSES._,Must old Eumæus feel?
6223,_ULYSSES._,
6224,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._ What couldst thou fear?
6225,_ULYSSES._,
6226,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._ Didst thou not know? The wooers sent a ship
6227,_ULYSSES._,"To take thee, son. Thou didst not? Well, some god"
6228,_ULYSSES._,Protected thee. Now let me look on thee.                         531
6229,_ULYSSES._,Come within. Sit thee down.
6230,_ULYSSES._,
6231,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._                      So will I gladly.
6232,_ULYSSES._,"Ere I would venture to the house, I came"
6233,_ULYSSES._,"To talk with thee, and learn if aught has passed."
6234,_ULYSSES._,My mother?...
6235,_ULYSSES._,
6236,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._        All is well, prince, yet; she bides"
6237,_ULYSSES._,"Patient and brave, and weeps both day and night;"
6238,_ULYSSES._,"Weeps too for thee. Give me thy spear, my son."
6239,_ULYSSES._,Now sit thee down. I say we have feared for thee.
6240,_ULYSSES._,
6241,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._ (_to Ul._). Nay, rise not, stranger; there be other seats,"
6242,_ULYSSES._,And men to set them.—Pardon me that my joy                       540
6243,_ULYSSES._,"O’erlooked thee. Thou hast guests, Eumæus?"
6244,_ULYSSES._,
6245,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._                                     Nay,"
6246,_ULYSSES._,None but this ancient father.
6247,_ULYSSES._,
6248,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._                        And who is he?
6249,_ULYSSES._,
6250,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._ To me is he a stranger as to thee.
6251,_ULYSSES._,"’Twas yesterday, he tells me, that his ship"
6252,_ULYSSES._,"Thesprotian, as he says, driven from her course,"
6253,_ULYSSES._,Put in for water: when for some mistrust
6254,_ULYSSES._,Or weariness of voyage he remained.
6255,_ULYSSES._,"He hath fed with me, but thou being now returned"
6256,_ULYSSES._,He looks to be a suppliant at the house.
6257,_ULYSSES._,He is thy man.
6258,_ULYSSES._,
6259,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._         Eumæus, thou must know                            550"
6260,_ULYSSES._,"I could not, whatsoe’er his claim, receive him"
6261,_ULYSSES._,Where I myself am threatened: and even my mother
6262,_ULYSSES._,"Holds no sure mind, wavering from day to day"
6263,_ULYSSES._,Who shall be master. No: there is no place
6264,_ULYSSES._,For suppliants at the house: but as thy guest
6265,_ULYSSES._,I still may treat him well: here he shall have
6266,_ULYSSES._,"Raiment and all he needs, and I will give him"
6267,_ULYSSES._,"A sword, and bid him fare where’er he will."
6268,_ULYSSES._,"But not to the house I bid him come, for fear"
6269,_ULYSSES._,Violence befall him and I be accursed.                           560
6270,_ULYSSES._,
6271,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ Sir, since thy kindness makes me bold to speak,"
6272,_ULYSSES._,"Thou hast my thanks; nor can I hear thy wrongs,"
6273,_ULYSSES._,"Nor see thy shame unmoved, for thou art noble."
6274,_ULYSSES._,"Hast thou provoked this, tell me, or are thy people"
6275,_ULYSSES._,"Moved by some god to hate, or is’t thy brethren"
6276,_ULYSSES._,Play thee false?
6277,_ULYSSES._,
6278,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._           Nay, there is neither grudge nor hate"
6279,_ULYSSES._,"Betwixt me and my folk, nor do my brethren"

6281,_ULYSSES._,That Zeus hath made our house of single heirs:

6283,_ULYSSES._,"And he one only son, Ulysses; I,"
6284,_ULYSSES._,"Ulysses’ son, am too his only child:"

6289,_ULYSSES._,"Were young as thou, and in my present mood;"
6290,_ULYSSES._,That I were this Ulysses or his son:
6291,_ULYSSES._,Far rather would I die slain in my halls
6292,_ULYSSES._,"By my thick foes, than see this reckless wrong;"
6293,_ULYSSES._,"My good farms plundered, and my herds devoured,"
6294,_ULYSSES._,"My red wine wasted, and my handmaidens                           580"

6308,_ULYSSES._,
6309,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ The heart unmoved by others’ wrongs is dead:
6310,_ULYSSES._,And yet maybe I am somewhat overwrought;

6339,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._                         Wilt thou think
6340,_ULYSSES._,I was at Sparta but three days ago?                              600
6341,_ULYSSES._,"There in my sleep the goddess, at whose word"
6342,_ULYSSES._,"I made this voyage, came and stood beside me,"
6343,_ULYSSES._,"Called me by name, and bade me quick return;"
6344,_ULYSSES._,And for my safety warned me that a ship
6345,_ULYSSES._,’Twixt Ithaca and Samè lay in wait;
6346,_ULYSSES._,"Which if I would avoid I must sail round,"
6347,_ULYSSES._,Keeping the west of the isle; and for that voyage
6348,_ULYSSES._,She promised a fair wind. So the next morn
6349,_ULYSSES._,"Was I at Pylos; whence as I set forth,"
6350,_ULYSSES._,"I found the wind, and sailing day and night,                     610"
6351,_ULYSSES._,With swift unbroken passage came to shore
6352,_ULYSSES._,Last evening north of the isle. Hither alone
6353,_ULYSSES._,"I passed in the dark, and sent my ship about."
6354,_ULYSSES._,
6355,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._ That was well done: I praise the gods for that.

6360,_ULYSSES._,"Were all agreed plotting my life together,"
6361,_ULYSSES._,Or whose deed is it?

6363,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._               One rancorous spirit rules them,—"
6364,_ULYSSES._,"Save Lord Amphinomus, who stands as ever"
6365,_ULYSSES._,Within the bounds: of all the rest there’s none                  620
6366,_ULYSSES._,"That would not take thy life by stealth, nor one"
6367,_ULYSSES._,Who openly would dare.

6379,_ULYSSES._,Not of revenge. Shall I make bold to go
6380,_ULYSSES._,"Straight to the house, or must I hide me here?"
6381,_ULYSSES._,
6382,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Bide, son, bide! ’Tis not safe. Let me go, son."
6383,_ULYSSES._,"When once ’tis known in the isle that thou’rt returned,"
6384,_ULYSSES._,Then thou mayst shew thyself. The cowards fear
6385,_ULYSSES._,The love the people bear thee. Let me go.                        630

6390,_ULYSSES._,
6391,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._ Eumæus, I’ll not venture yet: but thou"
6392,_ULYSSES._,"Haste to the house, and in my mother’s ear"
6393,_ULYSSES._,Whisper I am here: but let none other guess
6394,_ULYSSES._,That thou hast tidings of me.
6395,_ULYSSES._,
6396,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._                        Not to tell
6397,_ULYSSES._,"Thy grandsire, son? He scarce hath eat or drunk"
6398,_ULYSSES._,"While thou hast been away: ’twere well he knew,"
6399,_ULYSSES._,And quickly; for an hour is much to one
6400,_ULYSSES._,Whose life leans on the grave.
6401,_ULYSSES._,
6402,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._                         My safe return
6403,_ULYSSES._,"Can be no secret, but my hiding-place                            640"
6404,_ULYSSES._,Must not be known: therefore I would not have
6405,_ULYSSES._,Thee for my herald. Thou mayst bid my mother
6406,_ULYSSES._,Send one to comfort him; but go not thou
6407,_ULYSSES._,"Wandering among the hills. My bidding done,"
6408,_ULYSSES._,Make swift return. I shall be here.
6409,_ULYSSES._,
6410,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._                              I pray
6411,_ULYSSES._,"Let not that old man here come round thee, son,"
6412,_ULYSSES._,With idle stories of thy sire: he is full
6413,_ULYSSES._,Of tales of Troy: and if he win thine ear
6414,_ULYSSES._,He hath a purpose.
6415,_ULYSSES._,
6416,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._             He! Nay, trust me, father."
6417,_ULYSSES._,
6418,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Well, he will try.                                        650"
6419,_ULYSSES._,
6420,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._                    Fear not.
6421,_ULYSSES._,
6422,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._                              He hath a tongue:
6423,_ULYSSES._,"He saith he fought at Ilion. Then, he saith"
6424,_ULYSSES._,He knew Ulysses.
6425,_ULYSSES._,
6426,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._           Saith he so?
6427,_ULYSSES._,
6428,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._                        And then
6429,_ULYSSES._,He hath been in Lacedæmon too.
6430,_ULYSSES._,
6431,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._                         His talk
6432,_ULYSSES._,While thou’rt away may well beguile the time.
6433,_ULYSSES._,
6434,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ Ay, and thee too. Thou hast not heard, I fear,"
6435,_ULYSSES._,"Aught of thy father now, where thou hast been?"
6436,_ULYSSES._,
6437,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._ Somewhat, but nothing recent. What I know"
6438,_ULYSSES._,I’ll tell thee later. Thou couldst gather nought
6439,_ULYSSES._,From this old man?
6440,_ULYSSES._,
6441,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._             He is cunning: didst thou see
6442,_ULYSSES._,"How he could counterfeit? I tell thee, son,                      660"
6443,_ULYSSES._,"He hath not been here an hour, and never knew"
6444,_ULYSSES._,Aught of thy father; but he plucks from me
6445,_ULYSSES._,"The story word by word, and then at once"
6446,_ULYSSES._,"Bursts out,—he knew Ulysses: ay, he stayed"
6447,_ULYSSES._,Eating to speak of him.
6448,_ULYSSES._,
6449,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._                  What said he of him?
6450,_ULYSSES._,
6451,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._ I would not hear him, son: I would not hear him."
6452,_ULYSSES._,
6453,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._ Think you he lied?
6454,_ULYSSES._,
6455,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._                    Ay, ay. Why, how believe"
6456,_ULYSSES._,"Thy father now is in Thesprotia,"
6457,_ULYSSES._,Where the king Pheidon hath a ship all stored
6458,_ULYSSES._,To bring him home?
6459,_ULYSSES._,
6460,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._             Eumæus, good Eumæus!                          670"
6461,_ULYSSES._,What if ’tis true?
6462,_ULYSSES._,
6463,_ULYSSES._,"_Eum._             True! There, ’tis as I thought:"
6464,_ULYSSES._,"I would not leave thee with him, son; he is quick:"
6465,_ULYSSES._,He will delude thee.
6466,_ULYSSES._,
6467,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._               I must hear his tale,"
6468,_ULYSSES._,Though it be false. Go thou: my ship will else
6469,_ULYSSES._,"Be round before thee. Go, and never fear"
6470,_ULYSSES._,That this old man will turn my head.
6471,_ULYSSES._,
6472,_ULYSSES._,_Eum._                               Be warned.
6473,_ULYSSES._,"Trust him not, son. There is something strange about him"
6474,_ULYSSES._,I like not.
6475,_ULYSSES._,
6476,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._      Come: as far as to the gate
6477,_ULYSSES._,I will go with thee.                                     [_Exeunt._
6478,_ULYSSES._,
6479,_ULYSSES._,_Re-enter Ulysses as himself._
6480,_ULYSSES._,
6481,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ Lo! now the sun in the mid goal of heaven
6482,_ULYSSES._,"Hath climbed to view my fortunes, and my shade"
6483,_ULYSSES._,On this well-trodden floor falls neither way:                    682
6484,_ULYSSES._,So towers my genius; so my future and past
6485,_ULYSSES._,"Lie gathered for the moment.—How oft in dreams,"
6486,_ULYSSES._,"When longing hath forecast this hour, I have loved"
6487,_ULYSSES._,The rescuing tears that loosed my heart: and now
6488,_ULYSSES._,"The womanish water wells, I bid it back:"
6489,_ULYSSES._,"For nature stammers in me, and I see"
6490,_ULYSSES._,Imagination hath a grasp of joy                                  689
6491,_ULYSSES._,"Finer than sense; and my most passionate spirit,"
6492,_ULYSSES._,"When most it should leap forth, hangs back unwilling"
6493,_ULYSSES._,"To officer the trembling instruments,"
6494,_ULYSSES._,"By which delight is served. Back, then, my tears!"
6495,_ULYSSES._,Fate rules; reason should fashion me.—And welcome
6496,_ULYSSES._,Even this harshness of fate; for if my son
6497,_ULYSSES._,"Shall know me as I am, not as a merchant"
6498,_ULYSSES._,"Should I return at ease, that men might ask"
6499,_ULYSSES._,Whether Ulysses were returned or no;
6500,_ULYSSES._,Rather in blood than doubt.—Here on this bench
6501,_ULYSSES._,"I’ll wait him, nor myself be first to speak:                     700"
6502,_ULYSSES._,And ’twill be tried for once how a man’s son
6503,_ULYSSES._,"Shall know his father, never having seen him."
6504,_ULYSSES._,

6508,_ULYSSES._,"Sattest so late! In truth I much mistook thee,"
6509,_ULYSSES._,"Or thou art changed. Thy hair was thin and white,"
6510,_ULYSSES._,"Thy body rough and pinched with age, thy clothes"
6511,_ULYSSES._,"Were meanest rags. Say art thou he, the same,"
6512,_ULYSSES._,Eumæus’ guest from the Thesprotian ship?
6513,_ULYSSES._,
6514,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ Ay, son, I am."
6515,_ULYSSES._,
6516,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._               Surely thou art a god.

6520,_ULYSSES._,I am no god. Why wilt thou liken me
6521,_ULYSSES._,"To those immortals? I am thy father, son,"
6522,_ULYSSES._,Ulysses to my home at last returned.                  [_Kisses him._
6523,_ULYSSES._,
6524,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._ Alas, thou art a god, and thy words mock me."

6547,_ULYSSES._,
6548,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._  O, I am sure; who could be like thee?"
6549,_ULYSSES._,"I knew too thou wouldst come, dear father, and yet"
6550,_ULYSSES._,I never honoured thee enough: I thought
6551,_ULYSSES._,I should be worthy of thee: now I fear ...
6552,_ULYSSES._,
6553,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ I must be unlike thy thought, son; but in thee"
6554,_ULYSSES._,I see myself again of twenty years:                              730
6555,_ULYSSES._,"Nay, I was somewhat thicker, but maybe"
6556,_ULYSSES._,That will make up; and thou hast got instead
6557,_ULYSSES._,Thy mother’s grace. ’Tis true we mostly shape
6558,_ULYSSES._,Less to the father.
6559,_ULYSSES._,
6560,_ULYSSES._,"_Tel._              How, sire, didst thou come?"
6561,_ULYSSES._,
6562,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ A good Phæacian ship brought me last night.
6563,_ULYSSES._,I came to land in the dark: and all the spoils
6564,_ULYSSES._,"I have brought with me are hidden in the cave,"
6565,_ULYSSES._,Till we may fetch them forth.                                    738

6571,_ULYSSES._,"Ah, son; and would I might; but what of them"
6572,_ULYSSES._,That stop the way?
6573,_ULYSSES._,
6574,_ULYSSES._,_Tel._             The suitors of my mother?
6575,_ULYSSES._,"O, they will fly to hear of thy return."
6576,_ULYSSES._,
6577,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._ They must not fly. All, where they have done me wrong,"
6578,_ULYSSES._,Must with their lives atone. This is the cause
6579,_ULYSSES._,"Of my disguise, that none should know me here"
6580,_ULYSSES._,"But thou, to whom alone I am revealed,"
6581,_ULYSSES._,That plotting with thee I may draw the net
6582,_ULYSSES._,"About them. This the goddess bids me, son;"

6692,_ULYSSES._,Force them the more with full authority.
6693,_ULYSSES._,This canst thou well do. ’Tis thy harder task

6729,_ULYSSES._,"This bides, the harbour of his fancy,—and draws him"
6730,_ULYSSES._,Spite of all else from world’s end to world’s end.
6731,_ULYSSES._,"And more, more dear, are those whose place it was,"
6732,_ULYSSES._,"Whose name he is called by, whom he calls his own,"

6738,_ULYSSES._,But what thou know’st not—mayst thou come to know!—              860
6739,_ULYSSES._,I’ll tell thee. There be ties dearer than place

6745,_ULYSSES._,"Whose picture I have carried in my heart,"
6746,_ULYSSES._,And year by year have checked and altered still
6747,_ULYSSES._,With vain imagination to thy growth

7265,_TELEMACHUS._,Prepare a worthy sacrifice to Zeus;
7266,_TELEMACHUS._,"Ay, such a sacrifice, as to this day"
7267,_TELEMACHUS._,This house has never seen.
7268,_TELEMACHUS._,
7269,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._                     ’Tis very meet.
7270,_TELEMACHUS._,Yet why this urgence? there hath something passed
7271,_TELEMACHUS._,"Thou keepest back. Is’t possible, my boy,"
7272,_TELEMACHUS._,That in the southern courts some lady’s eyes
7273,_TELEMACHUS._,Have drawn thee to vow hecatombs?
7274,_TELEMACHUS._,
7275,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Tel._                            Nay, mother."
7276,_TELEMACHUS._,
7277,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._ I should be glad. What is it then hath changed thee?
7278,_TELEMACHUS._,
7279,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._ How am I changed?                                        1190
7280,_TELEMACHUS._,
7281,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._                   Thou art aloof and strange.
7282,_TELEMACHUS._,
7283,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._ It ever dulled my kinder spirits to view
7284,_TELEMACHUS._,These robbers in my father’s hall.
7285,_TELEMACHUS._,
7286,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._                             Alas!
7287,_TELEMACHUS._,"What could I do, my son, and thou away?"
7288,_TELEMACHUS._,"Here is no change, nor ever any tidings."
7289,_TELEMACHUS._,I have neither power nor reason on my side:
7290,_TELEMACHUS._,"I cannot say My lord is yet alive,"
7291,_TELEMACHUS._,"Wherefore depart, ye wrong me; nor as little"
7292,_TELEMACHUS._,"My lord is dead, I will requite your honour,"
7293,_TELEMACHUS._,"And choose the worthiest. O, where’er thou hast been,"
7294,_TELEMACHUS._,"If aught thou hast learned of any certainty,                    1200"
7295,_TELEMACHUS._,"Speak now, whate’er it be, fear not to tell:"
7296,_TELEMACHUS._,"Tell of thy sire, my son, though ’tis his death!"

7299,_TELEMACHUS._,
7300,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Pen._                              Alas, Telemachus;"
7301,_TELEMACHUS._,"What is our hope? Or if thou know of any,"

7303,_TELEMACHUS._,
7304,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Tel._                       Hearken, mother:"
7305,_TELEMACHUS._,"If thou wilt hear me, I will tell my story,"
7306,_TELEMACHUS._,"As time allows, stripped of all circumstance."
7307,_TELEMACHUS._,"First sailed I then to Pylos, where I found"
7308,_TELEMACHUS._,"Nestor, who lovingly my stay entreated,"
7309,_TELEMACHUS._,"And held me as his son, but, when he learned                    1210"
7310,_TELEMACHUS._,"My quest, and nothing knew of my dear father,"
7311,_TELEMACHUS._,"Would have me go, and with a royal escort"
7312,_TELEMACHUS._,Conveyed me to the court of Menelaus:
7313,_TELEMACHUS._,There I saw Argive Helen.—
7314,_TELEMACHUS._,"But Menelaus, when I told my tale"
7315,_TELEMACHUS._,"Brake out in anger, and I think few words"
7316,_TELEMACHUS._,Would draw him hither with his dukes to sweep
7317,_TELEMACHUS._,Our house of its dishonour; but in fine
7318,_TELEMACHUS._,"Thus much he said, that still Ulysses lived,"
7319,_TELEMACHUS._,But with the nymph Calypso in her isle                          1220
7320,_TELEMACHUS._,By subtle sleights withheld; in whom it lay
7321,_TELEMACHUS._,"That he was not returned, and might not yet;"
7322,_TELEMACHUS._,"But there abode. Then, since he knew no more,"
7323,_TELEMACHUS._,"I sped me home, and should have sped to death,"
7324,_TELEMACHUS._,Had not divine Athenè sent a dream
7325,_TELEMACHUS._,"To warn me of the ambush, with the wind"
7326,_TELEMACHUS._,To bring me round the isle: wherefore I bid thee
7327,_TELEMACHUS._,"Perform the sacrifice, lest for such favour"
7328,_TELEMACHUS._,We seem ungrateful.
7329,_TELEMACHUS._,
7330,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._              Didst thou never ask
7331,_TELEMACHUS._,"Of Menelaus, how he came to know                                1230"
7332,_TELEMACHUS._,Thy father’s fate?
7333,_TELEMACHUS._,
7334,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Tel._             It was the wizard Proteus,"
7335,_TELEMACHUS._,"Whom strangely he entamed and all his art,"
7336,_TELEMACHUS._,When he lay windbound in the isle of Pharos;
7337,_TELEMACHUS._,"Who told him, for he held him fast for all"
7338,_TELEMACHUS._,"His magic shifts and slippery changefulness,"
7339,_TELEMACHUS._,"Becoming first a bearded lion, thereafter"
7340,_TELEMACHUS._,"A snake, a leopard, and a bristly boar;"
7341,_TELEMACHUS._,"And then as running water seemed he, or"
7342,_TELEMACHUS._,A tall and flowering tree ...
7343,_TELEMACHUS._,
7344,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Pen._                        My son, my son,"
7345,_TELEMACHUS._,These are mere tales. When was this said to have been?          1240
7346,_TELEMACHUS._,
7347,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._ ’Twas scarce two years.
7348,_TELEMACHUS._,
7349,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Pen._                         Ah, and so long!"

7351,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._                                          ’Tis tidings
7352,_TELEMACHUS._,"Both sure and good, mother; and yet ’tis nought"
7353,_TELEMACHUS._,To what remains. The thing I sought abroad
7354,_TELEMACHUS._,"Has come to me at home: but if I tell thee,"
7355,_TELEMACHUS._,"Thou in thine inmost heart store it,—no word"
7356,_TELEMACHUS._,"Even to Eumæus, tho’ ’twas in his hut,"
7357,_TELEMACHUS._,"—Where as I crossed the isle I turned aside,—"
7358,_TELEMACHUS._,"I found an aged man, his beggar guest:"
7359,_TELEMACHUS._,"Whom, for Eumæus warned me he was full"
7360,_TELEMACHUS._,"Of tales of Troy, I held of no account                          1250"
7361,_TELEMACHUS._,"When first he spoke, but soon I learnt he knew."
7362,_TELEMACHUS._,"He was himself at Troy, and, as he saith,"
7363,_TELEMACHUS._,"Hath lately seen my father, who is free,"
7364,_TELEMACHUS._,And bent on swift return.
7365,_TELEMACHUS._,
7366,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._                    Is this thy news?
7367,_TELEMACHUS._,
7368,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._ Is’t not then news?
7369,_TELEMACHUS._,
7370,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Pen._                     Nay, nay, thou art deceived."
7371,_TELEMACHUS._,An idle tale Eumæus would not hear:
7372,_TELEMACHUS._,"A rogue he warned thee of, and not the first"
7373,_TELEMACHUS._,That thus hath lied.
7374,_TELEMACHUS._,
7375,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._               There hath been none like him.

7378,_TELEMACHUS._,Any credulity.
7379,_TELEMACHUS._,
7380,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._         I would not have                                 1260
7381,_TELEMACHUS._,"Thy mind less wary, nor bespeak thy credit."
7382,_TELEMACHUS._,"To-morrow I will bring him here, and then,"
7383,_TELEMACHUS._,"He being our guest, thyself mayst question him."
7384,_TELEMACHUS._,"And be thou not persuaded, I will look"
7385,_TELEMACHUS._,No longer for my father’s wished return;
7386,_TELEMACHUS._,"Nor after lend an ear to any man,"
7387,_TELEMACHUS._,"But hold him as our enemy, who saith"
7388,_TELEMACHUS._,Ulysses lives.
7389,_TELEMACHUS._,
7390,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._         In hoping and despairing
7391,_TELEMACHUS._,"Thou art too quick, my son; and past occasions"
7392,_TELEMACHUS._,"Have taught thee nought. Come, tell me of thyself,"
7393,_TELEMACHUS._,"And of thy journey. Tell me too of Helen,                       1271"
7394,_TELEMACHUS._,Is she still beautiful? and doth she live
7395,_TELEMACHUS._,Forgiven of Menelaus and beloved?
7396,_TELEMACHUS._,
7397,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Tel._ In good time, mother, shalt thou hear all this,"
7398,_TELEMACHUS._,And more. Consider now how best to prove
7399,_TELEMACHUS._,"This beggar, when I bring him."
7400,_TELEMACHUS._,
7401,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._                         If need were
7402,_TELEMACHUS._,"’Twere easy.—Yet, how should Eumæus err?"
7403,_TELEMACHUS._,Hath he not means to sift the false from true?
7404,_TELEMACHUS._,Could such a guest as this thou deemest dwell
7405,_TELEMACHUS._,With him unknown?
7406,_TELEMACHUS._,
7407,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._            Thou shalt thyself enquire.                   1280
7408,_TELEMACHUS._,"Weigh well what proof to use, but now no longer"
7409,_TELEMACHUS._,Delay the sacrifice my safety calls.                      [_Going._

7427,_TELEMACHUS._,_Pen._                  Indeed I know their minds.

7435,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Pen._ Alas! Then take Eumæus with thee, son."

7446,_TELEMACHUS._,"So handsome, loving, noble, brave, and good,"
7447,_TELEMACHUS._,"Had given him wisdom; for without that gift,"
7448,_TELEMACHUS._,"Grace bears no fruit. ’Tis plain to all, my son                 1300"
7449,_TELEMACHUS._,Hath not the truth of his advertisement:
7450,_TELEMACHUS._,"He wears the semblance only, such as lures"

7595,_CTESIPPUS._,Or I will drive you quicker than ye came.
7596,_CTESIPPUS._,
7597,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eur._ Eumæus, hear me: take thy man away.                      1370"
7598,_CTESIPPUS._,
7599,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eum._ Nay, Lord Eurymachus, ’tis never thou"
7600,_CTESIPPUS._,"Canst say begone to any from this hall,"
7601,_CTESIPPUS._,"Nay, nor Antinous nor Ctesippus either:"
7602,_CTESIPPUS._,"But if to me ye say it, ye forget"
7603,_CTESIPPUS._,How I stand here of right; nor is it like
7604,_CTESIPPUS._,"I stir for you. As for your music-making,"
7605,_CTESIPPUS._,"Be still yourselves, and we can sit in peace,"
7606,_CTESIPPUS._,And listen with you.
7607,_CTESIPPUS._,
7608,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Ant._               Ye to sit with us,"
7609,_CTESIPPUS._,Insolent villain!
7610,_CTESIPPUS._,
7611,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eur._            Whatsoe’er thy right,"
7612,_CTESIPPUS._,This filthy beggar is beyond all reason.                        1380
7613,_CTESIPPUS._,Who is he?
7614,_CTESIPPUS._,
7615,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eum._     Lord Eurymachus, this man,"
7616,_CTESIPPUS._,"Mean as he is, hath here more privilege"
7617,_CTESIPPUS._,Than thou. He comes by invitation hither;
7618,_CTESIPPUS._,He is the prince’s suppliant.
7619,_CTESIPPUS._,
7620,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eur._                        Now, Telemachus,"
7621,_CTESIPPUS._,Thou art reproached in this.
7622,_CTESIPPUS._,
7623,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eum._                       Come to reproach,"
7624,_CTESIPPUS._,I know a word.
7625,_CTESIPPUS._,
7626,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Ant._         Wag not thy beard at us,"
7627,_CTESIPPUS._,Thou low-bred hind.
7628,_CTESIPPUS._,
7629,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Tel._              Indeed, Eurymachus,"
7630,_CTESIPPUS._,I am not disgraced; for in my father’s hall
7631,_CTESIPPUS._,Was ever room and welcome for all such
7632,_CTESIPPUS._,"As needed food and shelter: nay, and they                       1390"
7633,_CTESIPPUS._,Who most have need stand first; as doth this man.
7634,_CTESIPPUS._,"As for my servant, he hath given an answer"
7635,_CTESIPPUS._,To those that have reviled him.
7636,_CTESIPPUS._,
7637,_CTESIPPUS._,_Amph._                         If so be
7638,_CTESIPPUS._,"This beggar is thy guest and suppliant,"
7639,_CTESIPPUS._,His fitter place were still the outer court:
7640,_CTESIPPUS._,Invite him thither.
7641,_CTESIPPUS._,
7642,_CTESIPPUS._,_Tel._              I have bid him here.
7643,_CTESIPPUS._,"And here he shall remain. Fear not, good father,"
7644,_CTESIPPUS._,"Go sit thee by the hearth: and thou, Amphinomus,"
7645,_CTESIPPUS._,Urge me not. I will have my way in this:
7646,_CTESIPPUS._,"Were there no other reason than this one,                       1400"
7647,_CTESIPPUS._,"That I will have my way. Take thou that stool,"
7648,_CTESIPPUS._,"Old man, and sit at ease: none here can touch thee."
7649,_CTESIPPUS._,
7650,_CTESIPPUS._,_Ctes._ (_to Ul. aside_). Dare!
7651,_CTESIPPUS._,
7652,_CTESIPPUS._,_Ant._ (_to Eur._).             Shall we brook this?
7653,_CTESIPPUS._,
7654,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eur._                                               Prince Telemachus,"
7655,_CTESIPPUS._,"Though thou be very son of great Ulysses,"
7656,_CTESIPPUS._,Think not to overrule us thus with words.
7657,_CTESIPPUS._,Dispose thou mayst within fair reason’s bounds
7658,_CTESIPPUS._,Even as thou wilt: so much in courtesy
7659,_CTESIPPUS._,"We grant, but not for fear; nor are our spirits"
7660,_CTESIPPUS._,Of stuff to suffer what indignities
7661,_CTESIPPUS._,Thy haughty temper may prepare. In this                         1410
7662,_CTESIPPUS._,We shall resist thee.
7663,_CTESIPPUS._,
7664,_CTESIPPUS._,_Tel._                There be men in Ithaca
7665,_CTESIPPUS._,"Call thee not king, Eurymachus; though here"
7666,_CTESIPPUS._,Thou take so much on thee.
7667,_CTESIPPUS._,
7668,_CTESIPPUS._,_Ant._                     Ha! threat’st thou us?
7669,_CTESIPPUS._,Telemachus! what next? This is’t to have been
7670,_CTESIPPUS._,"In Lacedæmon. Now may we, who ne’er"
7671,_CTESIPPUS._,"Have looked upon the godlike Menelaus,"
7672,_CTESIPPUS._,"Behold his mirror. Why, what game is this?"
7673,_CTESIPPUS._,Think’st thou with strength and might upon our side
7674,_CTESIPPUS._,We bandy words? I say this ragged loon
7675,_CTESIPPUS._,Shall not have place with us: the sight of him                  1420
7676,_CTESIPPUS._,Hath turned my stomach. If for any bond
7677,_CTESIPPUS._,"Of blood or service thou set store by him,"
7678,_CTESIPPUS._,Thou mayst do better for his skinny bones
7679,_CTESIPPUS._,Than stow them here. ’Twill not be many hours
7680,_CTESIPPUS._,That he shall trouble us.
7681,_CTESIPPUS._,
7682,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Tel._                    Ay, so may be."
7683,_CTESIPPUS._,"But wouldst thou kill him, Lord Antinous,"
7684,_CTESIPPUS._,"It had been better to have waylaid his ship,"
7685,_CTESIPPUS._,Or set an ambush for him in the hills.
7686,_CTESIPPUS._,
7687,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Ant._ (_aside_). By heaven, I smart."
7688,_CTESIPPUS._,
7689,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eur._                                Peace, peace!"

7691,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Amph._                                          Hark, if the prince"
7692,_CTESIPPUS._,"Persist, we may not say him nay. Be seated.                     1430"
7693,_CTESIPPUS._,Maybe our lady’s voice may interpose:
7694,_CTESIPPUS._,Let us defer our grievance to the word
7695,_CTESIPPUS._,Of sage Penelope.
7696,_CTESIPPUS._,
7697,_CTESIPPUS._,_Ant._            How shall I sit
7698,_CTESIPPUS._,In presence of such insult?
7699,_CTESIPPUS._,
7700,_CTESIPPUS._,_Eur._                      Sit thou down.
7701,_CTESIPPUS._,
7702,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Ant._ (_aside to Ul._). Man, as thou lovest life, fly"

7711,_CTESIPPUS._,"Eumæus, take him meat and wine."
7712,_CTESIPPUS._,
7713,_CTESIPPUS._,_Ul._ (_sitting at r. front_).  I thank thee.
7714,_CTESIPPUS._,
7715,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Ctes._ Go further off, I pray; I’m not thy friend,"
7716,_CTESIPPUS._,Thou hoary plague.
7717,_CTESIPPUS._,
7718,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Eur._             Silence, the music sounds.                   1440"

7730,_PHEMIUS._,Admires and envies not?
7731,_PHEMIUS._,"At one time one, at another another best,"

7734,_PHEMIUS._,"Are ever of worth,"
7735,_PHEMIUS._,"Everywhere are praisèd and excellent,"
7736,_PHEMIUS._,To live and possess the earth:                          1450
7737,_PHEMIUS._,And my name—ranked desire ’mong graven things—
7738,_PHEMIUS._,Would live with the island kings.

7746,_PHEMIUS._,Shout—O well is thee!
7747,_PHEMIUS._,"The gods in worship and joy, pray we,"

7760,_PHEMIUS._,"For her new-married he left and his newborn boy,"
7761,_PHEMIUS._,"His true-born prince to manhood now upgrown,"

7791,_PENELOPE._,Hush ye these mournful strains!—’tis music’s skill
7792,_PENELOPE._,To comfort and wean sorrow’s heart away
7793,_PENELOPE._,With beautiful distractions from its woe:                       1490
7794,_PENELOPE._,"Not to be plunged therein, and chafe remembrance"
7795,_PENELOPE._,"With added echoes. Oh, I have wept enough."
7796,_PENELOPE._,"Would you my life should faster waste in grief,"
7797,_PENELOPE._,That ye must widen more its aching channels
7798,_PENELOPE._,With melancholy dirges? These are fit
7799,_PENELOPE._,"For souls at ease; ay, such as ye, my lords,"
7800,_PENELOPE._,"Who feel no thorns prick you, may love to drink"
7801,_PENELOPE._,The soft compunctious mimicries of woe.
7802,_PENELOPE._,"But me with all your pleasures still ye vex,"

7849,_PENELOPE._,"Of all that thou mislikest in our suit,"
7850,_PENELOPE._,"Is but the boon we crave: choose one of us,"

7870,_PENELOPE._,"’Gainst Ilion, and bore hence with them my lord:"
7871,_PENELOPE._,"But should he come to rule again his house,"
7872,_PENELOPE._,Fairer than ever then my fame would be

7909,_PENELOPE._,"This yellow-glistening chain,—whereof"

7923,_PENELOPE._,
7924,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ My thanks: ’tis brave and sweet attire.
7925,_PENELOPE._,"Long hath thy wealth been known to me,"
7926,_PENELOPE._,And grateful would thy marriage be
7927,_PENELOPE._,Both to my brethren and my sire.
7928,_PENELOPE._,What have we here?
7929,_PENELOPE._,
7930,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._             Lady, my gift."
7931,_PENELOPE._,"This ample robe my servants bear,                               1590"
7932,_PENELOPE._,"White as the snow’s fresh-wandered drift,"
7933,_PENELOPE._,"Light as the air and beautiful,"
7934,_PENELOPE._,Is woven of the softest wool
7935,_PENELOPE._,Our curly highland chilvers wear;
7936,_PENELOPE._,Fresh from the loom: and on the robe
7937,_PENELOPE._,"Twelve golden brooches, globe to globe,"
7938,_PENELOPE._,"With fretted clasps of Syrian art,"
7939,_PENELOPE._,"Which, brought by war to Egypt’s mart,"
7940,_PENELOPE._,"From thence—with many gawds beside,"
7941,_PENELOPE._,"Now mine—my grandsire took, when he,                            1600"
7942,_PENELOPE._,"Crossing in ship the Libyan sea,"
7943,_PENELOPE._,Sailed up the mighty river wide;
7944,_PENELOPE._,But these for beauty stood alone.
7945,_PENELOPE._,
7946,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ I thank thee. This I’ll not deny
7947,_PENELOPE._,For some misdeeds may well atone.
7948,_PENELOPE._,Who cometh next?
7949,_PENELOPE._,
7950,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._          Lady, ’tis I:"
7951,_PENELOPE._,"And give my homage one kind word,"
7952,_PENELOPE._,I shall not scorn to come but third.
7953,_PENELOPE._,My offering is this veil.
7954,_PENELOPE._,
7955,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ O wondrous work and rare!                                1610
7956,_PENELOPE._,’Tis like the golden mail
7957,_PENELOPE._,"Of Hera’s braided hair,"
7958,_PENELOPE._,"Which every step sets hovering,"
7959,_PENELOPE._,Her brow discovering.
7960,_PENELOPE._,
7961,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._ So ’tis most fit for thee,"
7962,_PENELOPE._,Rarest Penelope.
7963,_PENELOPE._,
7964,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Or such methinks love’s queen
7965,_PENELOPE._,"Across her forehead tieth,"
7966,_PENELOPE._,Whene’er along the green
7967,_PENELOPE._,"Of river-banks she hieth,                                       1620"
7968,_PENELOPE._,To cheer with sweet embraces
7969,_PENELOPE._,Her sister graces.
7970,_PENELOPE._,
7971,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._ Therefore most fit for thee,"
7972,_PENELOPE._,Queenly Penelope.
7973,_PENELOPE._,
7974,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Oh, ’tis most fine: I thank thee. Is’t thy meaning"
7975,_PENELOPE._,That I should wear the veil?
7976,_PENELOPE._,
7977,_PENELOPE._,_Amph._ ’Twould deck thee well.
7978,_PENELOPE._,
7979,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ (_aside_). Here is some favour shewn.
7980,_PENELOPE._,
7981,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ My gracious thanks.
7982,_PENELOPE._,
7983,_PENELOPE._,"_A suitor._ See now my gift, O queen.                           1630"
7984,_PENELOPE._,
7985,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ (_aside to Amph._). Sir, I would speak with thee."
7986,_PENELOPE._,
7987,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._                   Nay, man; be silent.—"
7988,_PENELOPE._,
7989,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Ah, ’tis Peisander, what brings he?"
7990,_PENELOPE._,
7991,_PENELOPE._,"_The suitor._ Lady, if ever thou didst see"
7992,_PENELOPE._,Three dewdrops gathered full within
7993,_PENELOPE._,"Some unawakened lily’s cup,"
7994,_PENELOPE._,"Each swollen to fall, or e’er begin"
7995,_PENELOPE._,The stalks to dress themselves aright:
7996,_PENELOPE._,"For yet the sun, that hasteth up,"
7997,_PENELOPE._,"Pricks not their delicate stems,"
7998,_PENELOPE._,Nor spreads the crimson petals bright:                          1640
7999,_PENELOPE._,That were an image of the gems
8000,_PENELOPE._,"Which in this casket lie, a pair"
8001,_PENELOPE._,Fit for thine ears to wear.
8002,_PENELOPE._,
8003,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ I thank thee, good Peisander; set it down"
8004,_PENELOPE._,Here with the rest.
8005,_PENELOPE._,
8006,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ (_aside to Amph._). Sir, I would speak with thee."
8007,_PENELOPE._,
8008,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._ (_to Ul._). Nay, stand aloof.—"
8009,_PENELOPE._,
8010,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._                                  Ye do me honour, lords;"
8011,_PENELOPE._,"Yet must reception end. I will take all,"
8012,_PENELOPE._,And note the givers. Now my constant grief
8013,_PENELOPE._,Is strangely awakened. (_To maids._) Gather up the gifts.
8014,_PENELOPE._,
8015,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ (_aside to Amph._). Sir! speak with me.                   1650
8016,_PENELOPE._,
8017,_PENELOPE._,_Amph._ (_to Ul._).                           What wouldst thou?
8018,_PENELOPE._,
8019,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._                                               See, the rogue"
8020,_PENELOPE._,Begins to beg.
8021,_PENELOPE._,
8022,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._         Lady, ere yet thou go,"
8023,_PENELOPE._,Grant me thine ear. There is come into the hall
8024,_PENELOPE._,"A beggar, who for mere propriety                         [_Ul. sits._"
8025,_PENELOPE._,"We would were housed without. The prince, thy son,"
8026,_PENELOPE._,Against our general comfort bids him here.
8027,_PENELOPE._,Let thy kind favour spare us this annoyance.
8028,_PENELOPE._,
8029,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ That is he?
8030,_PENELOPE._,
8031,_PENELOPE._,_Eur._             Ay.
8032,_PENELOPE._,
8033,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._                 Lo! by the fire he sits.
8034,_PENELOPE._,
8035,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ (_aside_). How strange a man. (_To Tel._) Is this
8036,_PENELOPE._,"thy guest, my son?"
8037,_PENELOPE._,
8038,_PENELOPE._,_Tel._ ’Tis he I spoke of.
8039,_PENELOPE._,
8040,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ (_to Tel._).        Surely the complaint
8041,_PENELOPE._,Hath a fair ground. To save offence ’twere best
8042,_PENELOPE._,"Dismiss him with some gift—I leave, my lords,"
8043,_PENELOPE._,This matter where it lies: My son rules here.                   1662
8044,_PENELOPE._,Farewell. Keep peace amongst you.
8045,_PENELOPE._,(_To maids._)                     Bear off the gifts.       [_Exit._
8046,_PENELOPE._,
8047,_PENELOPE._,"_All._ Farewell, fairest Penelope."
8048,_PENELOPE._,
8049,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._ Ere now we sit again,"
8050,_PENELOPE._,I ask the prince once more if he persist
8051,_PENELOPE._,To vex our party with this beggar’s presence.
8052,_PENELOPE._,
8053,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._ Press me not, lords, ye know my will: and how"
8054,_PENELOPE._,In night and darkness should I turn away
8055,_PENELOPE._,"A houseless guest? Nay, but for you ’tis time                   1670"
8056,_PENELOPE._,Ye sought your lodges.
8057,_PENELOPE._,
8058,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._ (_to Eum._).    Thou presumptuous swineherd,"
8059,_PENELOPE._,Why drovest thou this nuisance to the town?
8060,_PENELOPE._,"Had we not tramps and scamps eno’, starved beggars"
8061,_PENELOPE._,"And needy scavengers, haunting the place,"
8062,_PENELOPE._,"Ravening thy master’s substance, that thou now"
8063,_PENELOPE._,Must fetch in this one too?
8064,_PENELOPE._,
8065,_PENELOPE._,"_Eum._                      Antinous,"
8066,_PENELOPE._,"Thou speak’st not fair, lord tho’ thou be; that here"
8067,_PENELOPE._,Set at another’s board wouldst judge and grudge
8068,_PENELOPE._,The spending of thy host. I know that thou
8069,_PENELOPE._,"Art like the world, who bid unto their tables                   1680"
8070,_PENELOPE._,"But such as can repay them well in kind,"
8071,_PENELOPE._,Or by some service or amusement made;
8072,_PENELOPE._,And none will ever ask a beggar-man
8073,_PENELOPE._,To help him eat. Thou too wast always hard
8074,_PENELOPE._,"Above all here to all, and most to me."
8075,_PENELOPE._,"But I care not, while my dear gracious mistress"
8076,_PENELOPE._,"Dwells with the prince, my master."
8077,_PENELOPE._,
8078,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._ (_aside to Eum._).          Hush, Eumæus;"
8079,_PENELOPE._,Truth is the hardest taunt to bear.
8080,_PENELOPE._,
8081,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._                              Thou hind!
8082,_PENELOPE._,Answerest thou me?
8083,_PENELOPE._,
8084,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._             I laugh, Antinous,"
8085,_PENELOPE._,To have thee play the master in this house.                     1690
8086,_PENELOPE._,Bid me dismiss my guest? The gods forfend!
8087,_PENELOPE._,Thee rather bid I help to entertain him.
8088,_PENELOPE._,Lo! thou hast feasted well: give off thy plate
8089,_PENELOPE._,"Thy leavings to this beggar. Go, old man,—"
8090,_PENELOPE._,These lords can of their surplus well afford
8091,_PENELOPE._,"To furnish thee a supper,—go, I charge thee,"
8092,_PENELOPE._,And take what each may give.
8093,_PENELOPE._,
8094,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._                       By Zeus in heaven,"
8095,_PENELOPE._,"Thou bear’st me hard. If all but give as I,"
8096,_PENELOPE._,He shall not make the round.
8097,_PENELOPE._,
8098,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ (_coming to Ant._).    Sir, give me somewhat."
8099,_PENELOPE._,"Thou comest, I warrant, of no common stock,                     1700"
8100,_PENELOPE._,But of some great house: thou’rt featured like a king:
8101,_PENELOPE._,"Thou wilt not stint thy hand: and, treat me well,"
8102,_PENELOPE._,It lies in chance I yet may make return.
8103,_PENELOPE._,"For I too once had my own house, and lived"
8104,_PENELOPE._,"In state, nor e’er turned any from my doors,"
8105,_PENELOPE._,"Whoever he might be, whate’er his need."
8106,_PENELOPE._,"I had my slaves and thralls, and all in plenty,"
8107,_PENELOPE._,That rich men have; but Zeus made nought of all:
8108,_PENELOPE._,"For his will surely ’twas, who sent me forth"
8109,_PENELOPE._,"With wandering pirates, sailing up the river                    1710"
8110,_PENELOPE._,"Of Egypt, a long voyage—and to my ruin:"
8111,_PENELOPE._,"For tarrying there, my crews in mutiny"
8112,_PENELOPE._,"Brake from me, and doing bloody violence"
8113,_PENELOPE._,"Unto the people of the king, were slain,"
8114,_PENELOPE._,"And I enslaved. But of the king’s good pleasure,"
8115,_PENELOPE._,"With whom I lacked not favour, I was sent"
8116,_PENELOPE._,In time to Cyprus ...
8117,_PENELOPE._,
8118,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._                Plague thee and thy lies!
8119,_PENELOPE._,"Stand off, back from my table; lest thou come"
8120,_PENELOPE._,"To a bitter Egypt, and a mournful Cyprus."
8121,_PENELOPE._,"Begone, I say."
8122,_PENELOPE._,
8123,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._          Lo! now I see thou lackest                       1720
8124,_PENELOPE._,Wisdom unto thy beauty. Of thine own
8125,_PENELOPE._,"Thou wouldst not give away a pinch of salt,"
8126,_PENELOPE._,Since thou withholdest here what costs thee nothing.
8127,_PENELOPE._,
8128,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._ Then take what I would give thee ere thou go.  [_Strikes him._
8129,_PENELOPE._,
8130,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ Ha! wilt thou strike me!—Why, and even a blow"
8131,_PENELOPE._,Thou giv’st not well.
8132,_PENELOPE._,
8133,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._               Shame, shame!"
8134,_PENELOPE._,
8135,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._                              Enough, Antinous."
8136,_PENELOPE._,
8137,_PENELOPE._,"_Eum._ To strike a man so old, thy fellow-guest!"
8138,_PENELOPE._,"Come back, good father, to thy seat."
8139,_PENELOPE._,
8140,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._                                Now, hear me,"
8141,_PENELOPE._,"Ye wooers of the queen, for I will speak."
8142,_PENELOPE._,Many hard blows in honourable fight                             1730
8143,_PENELOPE._,"I have borne, and held them nought; but to be smitten"
8144,_PENELOPE._,"For being an-hungered, tho’ the hurt be small"
8145,_PENELOPE._,’Tis huge in wrong; and as there is a god
8146,_PENELOPE._,"To avenge the poor, I say this ill-bred lord"
8147,_PENELOPE._,Shall never live to see his marriage day.
8148,_PENELOPE._,
8149,_PENELOPE._,_Eum._ And so say I.
8150,_PENELOPE._,
8151,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._               Now for thy paltry curse
8152,_PENELOPE._,Think thyself lucky I bid not my men
8153,_PENELOPE._,"Hale thee without, and flay thee with their whips."
8154,_PENELOPE._,
8155,_PENELOPE._,_Some wooers_ (_murmuring_). How will Antinous woo
8156,_PENELOPE._,"our queen,"
8157,_PENELOPE._,Having his hand accursed with shame?—                           1740
8158,_PENELOPE._,Doth he forget the gods have been
8159,_PENELOPE._,In such disguise?—How Zeus once came
8160,_PENELOPE._,Thus to Lycaon’s feast unbid:—
8161,_PENELOPE._,"Or how in Celeus’ house, ’tis said,"
8162,_PENELOPE._,Demeter at Eleusis hid?—
8163,_PENELOPE._,"And were he but a man, ’tis dread"
8164,_PENELOPE._,To smite in wrath the hoary head.
8165,_PENELOPE._,
8166,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._ Father, I bring thee meat. May happiness"
8167,_PENELOPE._,"Ere long be thine, for what thou sufferest now."
8168,_PENELOPE._,
8169,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ (_reseated at front, to Amph._). I thank thee,"
8170,_PENELOPE._,"lord Amphinomus, and since                                   1750"
8171,_PENELOPE._,"I see thee like thy father, wise and good,"
8172,_PENELOPE._,"Old Nisus of Dulichium, I will say"
8173,_PENELOPE._,What thrice thou hast refused to hear: Attend.
8174,_PENELOPE._,"Of all that moves and breathes upon the earth,"
8175,_PENELOPE._,Nóthing is found more únstáble than man.
8176,_PENELOPE._,"Awhile his spirit within him is gay, his limbs"
8177,_PENELOPE._,"Light, and he saith, No ill shall overtake me."
8178,_PENELOPE._,Then evil comes: and lo! he beareth it
8179,_PENELOPE._,"Patiently, in its turn as God provides."
8180,_PENELOPE._,"So I too once looked to be ever happy,                          1760"
8181,_PENELOPE._,"And gave the rein to wantonness, and now—"
8182,_PENELOPE._,"Thou seest me ... Wherefore, say I, let no man"
8183,_PENELOPE._,"Be lawless, but in quiet and reserve"
8184,_PENELOPE._,Possess whatever good the gods have sent.
8185,_PENELOPE._,"And this I witness ’gainst the deeds I see,"
8186,_PENELOPE._,"These wooers, full of mischief, making waste,"
8187,_PENELOPE._,"And doing such dishonour to a lady,"
8188,_PENELOPE._,"Whose lord not long will tarry: nay, I tell thee                1768"
8189,_PENELOPE._,"He is very near,—ay, near. May thy good genius"
8190,_PENELOPE._,"Withdraw thee soon, lest thou shouldst meet his wrath"
8191,_PENELOPE._,When he returns: for not without blood-spilling
8192,_PENELOPE._,"Will they be sundered, these infatuate wooers"
8193,_PENELOPE._,"And he, when he comes stepping thro’ his house."
8194,_PENELOPE._,
8195,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._ What saith this ancient seer, that makes thy brow"
8196,_PENELOPE._,To cloud?
8197,_PENELOPE._,
8198,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ (_aside to Amph._) Fly hence to-night.
8199,_PENELOPE._,
8200,_PENELOPE._,_Amph._                                      Ill hath been done him:
8201,_PENELOPE._,Shew him more kindness.
8202,_PENELOPE._,
8203,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._                  Why, methinks I see"
8204,_PENELOPE._,"A fine celestial glory on his crown,"
8205,_PENELOPE._,"So brightly gleams the torchlight on it: nay,"
8206,_PENELOPE._,"And never a hair at all. (_To Ul._) Old man, ’tis true"
8207,_PENELOPE._,"Thou’rt out at elbows; wilt thou earn a living,                 1780"
8208,_PENELOPE._,I’ll take thee on. If thou canst gather stones
8209,_PENELOPE._,"Or trench, I’ll find thee wages and good food,"
8210,_PENELOPE._,"Ay, and a coat and shoes: but well I know"
8211,_PENELOPE._,"Thou’rt practised but in sloth, or if thou bend"
8212,_PENELOPE._,"Thy body, ’tis in louting thro’ the land"
8213,_PENELOPE._,To beg thy bellyful.
8214,_PENELOPE._,
8215,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._                Now, lord Eurymachus,"
8216,_PENELOPE._,I would that there might be a trial of labour
8217,_PENELOPE._,"’Twixt us in springtide, when the days grow long,"
8218,_PENELOPE._,"In the deep grass; and I would have my scythe,"
8219,_PENELOPE._,"And thou another, striking blow for blow,                       1790"
8220,_PENELOPE._,Fasting from dawn till dark: Or give us each
8221,_PENELOPE._,"A plow, and for a team four sturdy oxen,"
8222,_PENELOPE._,Frammard and toward to break up between us
8223,_PENELOPE._,A stubble of thirty acres; thou shouldst see
8224,_PENELOPE._,"If I could veer out straight: Or would, I say,"
8225,_PENELOPE._,"That Zeus would send us war,—I care not whence,—"
8226,_PENELOPE._,"To-day;—then set a helmet on my brows,"
8227,_PENELOPE._,And give me in either hand a spear and shield;
8228,_PENELOPE._,Thou shouldst not taunt me with my belly then.
8229,_PENELOPE._,"Now art thou merely insolent and rough,                         1800"
8230,_PENELOPE._,Because thy fellows are so few and feeble:
8231,_PENELOPE._,"And if Ulysses came and faced thee here,"
8232,_PENELOPE._,"Those doors, wide as they are, would seem too small"
8233,_PENELOPE._,"And narrow for thee, in thy haste to fly."
8234,_PENELOPE._,
8235,_PENELOPE._,_Eur._ Try thou their width then.
8236,_PENELOPE._,

8242,_PENELOPE._,

8252,_PENELOPE._,_Ctes._ In time: thou’st broke my head.
8253,_PENELOPE._,
8254,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._                                  By heaven, this beggar"
8255,_PENELOPE._,Grows to be some one: let us drive him forth.                   1810
8256,_PENELOPE._,
8257,_PENELOPE._,"_Amph._ Peace, peace!"
8258,_PENELOPE._,
8259,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._                See where he stands.
8260,_PENELOPE._,
8261,_PENELOPE._,_Eur._ (_to Amph._).                       Wilt thou protect him?
8262,_PENELOPE._,
8263,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._ Lords, are ye mad? The god disturbs your wits."
8264,_PENELOPE._,Else what ye have drunk declares ’tis time ye part.
8265,_PENELOPE._,
8266,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._ Then list to me. Let us begone, but first"
8267,_PENELOPE._,"Rouse we the game: start we this beggar hence,"
8268,_PENELOPE._,And hunt him at the spear-point thro’ the town.
8269,_PENELOPE._,With me for sport!
8270,_PENELOPE._,
8271,_PENELOPE._,"_Some wooers._     Hie there, hie! Tally ho!"
8272,_PENELOPE._,
8273,_PENELOPE._,_Eum._ Not if I die for it.
8274,_PENELOPE._,
8275,_PENELOPE._,_Amph._                     Fools! Give o’er.
8276,_PENELOPE._,
8277,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._                                        Now, lords,"
8278,_PENELOPE._,What keeps you back?
8279,_PENELOPE._,
8280,_PENELOPE._,_Re-enter suddenly Penelope with maids._
8281,_PENELOPE._,
8282,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Shame, shame! what vile and drunken brawl is this,       1820"
8283,_PENELOPE._,"That reaching to my chamber, brings me down"
8284,_PENELOPE._,At mid of night in fear lest in your revels
8285,_PENELOPE._,"Ye stain my floors with blood? Ah, now ye are shamed."
8286,_PENELOPE._,"How rose this sudden uproar ’mongst you, lords?"
8287,_PENELOPE._,"Honour ye not my son, that in his presence,"
8288,_PENELOPE._,"The morrow of his return, ye are broken forth"
8289,_PENELOPE._,In more disordered noise than e’er before?
8290,_PENELOPE._,"If ye respect not him, me ye respect:"
8291,_PENELOPE._,Who answers for you?
8292,_PENELOPE._,
8293,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._               That impertinent swineherd ...
8294,_PENELOPE._,
8295,_PENELOPE._,_Eur._ The wretch I spake of ...
8296,_PENELOPE._,
8297,_PENELOPE._,"_Ctes._                          Nay, Eurymachus,               1830"
8298,_PENELOPE._,’Twas thou as much.
8299,_PENELOPE._,
8300,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._              Speak one for all.
8301,_PENELOPE._,
8302,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._                                 O lady,"
8303,_PENELOPE._,Thy son hath fetched a beggar in to mock us.
8304,_PENELOPE._,
8305,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Telemachus, what is it?"
8306,_PENELOPE._,
8307,_PENELOPE._,_Tel._                         Of this riot
8308,_PENELOPE._,The whole occasion lies but with these lords;
8309,_PENELOPE._,"Who have raised their hands to strike their fellow-guest,"
8310,_PENELOPE._,And as thou cam’st were risen to drive him forth.
8311,_PENELOPE._,
8312,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ I know not, sirs, what sort of man this is,"
8313,_PENELOPE._,That so hath stirred your wrath: but be ye sure
8314,_PENELOPE._,That shelter offered here is shelter given.
8315,_PENELOPE._,Yet at your instance I will take upon me                        1840
8316,_PENELOPE._,"To make enquiry, and will give your wishes"
8317,_PENELOPE._,"All fair allowance, as my older guests."
8318,_PENELOPE._,Meanwhile depart: ye have feasted long: depart:
8319,_PENELOPE._,’Tis time indeed: I bid you all good-night.
8320,_PENELOPE._,
8321,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._ The queen has spoken, lords; depart at once."
8322,_PENELOPE._,
8323,_PENELOPE._,_Ant._ The villain will escape us yet.
8324,_PENELOPE._,
8325,_PENELOPE._,"_Ctes._                                He shall not,"
8326,_PENELOPE._,If he go forth to-night.
8327,_PENELOPE._,
8328,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._                   And if he stay,"
8329,_PENELOPE._,To-morrow I will serve him.
8330,_PENELOPE._,
8331,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._                      Lords, depart!"
8332,_PENELOPE._,
8333,_PENELOPE._,"_Ant._ Fare thee well, prince; I shall return at morn."
8334,_PENELOPE._,
8335,_PENELOPE._,"_Wooers._ Good-night, rarest Penelope.—                         1850"
8336,_PENELOPE._,"Fair queen of Ithaca, good-night.—                        [_Going._"
8337,_PENELOPE._,
8338,_PENELOPE._,"_Eur._ Until to-morrow, fairest queen, adieu.              [_Exit._"
8339,_PENELOPE._,
8340,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ (_to Eum._). Eumæus, hither; who is this old man?"
8341,_PENELOPE._,
8342,_PENELOPE._,"_Eum._ Why ’tis a strange old man, and full of lies:"
8343,_PENELOPE._,Yet ’tis an honest and a wise old man.
8344,_PENELOPE._,
8345,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ How full of lies and honest?
8346,_PENELOPE._,
8347,_PENELOPE._,"_Eum._                              Gracious madam,"
8348,_PENELOPE._,"I have looked on many men, and by their gait"
8349,_PENELOPE._,And voice and eyes are honest men well known;
8350,_PENELOPE._,And this old man is such: but when he speaks
8351,_PENELOPE._,"Such floods of words run o’er his aged lips,                    1860"
8352,_PENELOPE._,"Ay, and such tales,—and ever when he draws"
8353,_PENELOPE._,"To make conclusion, ’tis the same old fable,"
8354,_PENELOPE._,"That he hath seen the master, that the master"
8355,_PENELOPE._,Will soon return:—therefore I say he lies.
8356,_PENELOPE._,
8357,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Hath he been with us long?
8358,_PENELOPE._,
8359,_PENELOPE._,_Eum._                            ’Twas yestermorn
8360,_PENELOPE._,He came.
8361,_PENELOPE._,
8362,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Enough. Thou mayst go home. Good-night.
8363,_PENELOPE._,
8364,_PENELOPE._,"_Eum._ Good-night, my lady.                                [_Exit._"
8365,_PENELOPE._,
8366,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._                      O my son, my son;"
8367,_PENELOPE._,"I think that years and use, which perfect others,"
8368,_PENELOPE._,Serve but to blunt thy reason: as a child
8369,_PENELOPE._,"Thou hadst a shrewder wit, and quick enough;                    1870"
8370,_PENELOPE._,"But now, when any man to look on thee"
8371,_PENELOPE._,"Would say that thou wert some one, thy behaviour"
8372,_PENELOPE._,Would blast his praise.
8373,_PENELOPE._,
8374,_PENELOPE._,_Tel._                  Tell me what ill I have done.
8375,_PENELOPE._,
8376,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ What thou hast done? My heart was full of hope;
8377,_PENELOPE._,"I looked for thy return as happiness,"
8378,_PENELOPE._,How hast thou dashed it. I had well forgot
8379,_PENELOPE._,"The empty tales thou broughtest me for tidings,"
8380,_PENELOPE._,"Nor marked the fault, seeing thy zeal in love"
8381,_PENELOPE._,Outrun thy judgment: but when thou hast invited
8382,_PENELOPE._,"Thy man to be our guest, and canst not then                     1880"
8383,_PENELOPE._,Protect him: this is shame.
8384,_PENELOPE._,
8385,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._                      Mother, I think"
8386,_PENELOPE._,To do a wrong is shame: to suffer wrong
8387,_PENELOPE._,Asks not for pardon.
8388,_PENELOPE._,
8389,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._               Ay, but what to do?"
8390,_PENELOPE._,Thy guest hath been insulted: hast thou power
8391,_PENELOPE._,"To punish that? and of the two reproaches,"
8392,_PENELOPE._,"To suffer it again, or to dismiss,"
8393,_PENELOPE._,"As must be, him to whom thou offeredst shelter,"
8394,_PENELOPE._,I know not which is worse.
8395,_PENELOPE._,
8396,_PENELOPE._,_Tel._                     Wilt thou dismiss
8397,_PENELOPE._,The herald of such hope?
8398,_PENELOPE._,
8399,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._                   Eumæus saith
8400,_PENELOPE._,His tales are lies.
8401,_PENELOPE._,
8402,_PENELOPE._,_Tel._              Speak with him but thyself:                 1890
8403,_PENELOPE._,"Make proof thyself: if thou be not persuaded,"
8404,_PENELOPE._,"He shall not bide the night. Nay, if he lies,"
8405,_PENELOPE._,"Let him go starve. See, I will bring thee to him."
8406,_PENELOPE._,
8407,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ If so thou wilt. (_To maids._) Maidens,"
8408,_PENELOPE._,begone.                                         [_Exeunt maids._
8409,_PENELOPE._,
8410,_PENELOPE._,"_Tel._                                                 Old man,"
8411,_PENELOPE._,"The words which thou hast told me, now make good"
8412,_PENELOPE._,Unto my honoured mother.                                   [_Exit._
8413,_PENELOPE._,
8414,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Thou strange old man, whose thin and sorry rags"
8415,_PENELOPE._,Speak thee no friend of heaven; whose many years
8416,_PENELOPE._,Find thee a wanderer in a foreign land;
8417,_PENELOPE._,"Who art thou, I will ask, and with what tale                    1900"
8418,_PENELOPE._,"Winning my son, thou comest to the house"
8419,_PENELOPE._,"Of good Ulysses, and to me his wife"
8420,_PENELOPE._,Pretendest tidings of my long-lost lord?
8421,_PENELOPE._,
8422,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ O lady, there is none in all the world"
8423,_PENELOPE._,"Would blame the word thou sayest, so fair thy fame:"
8424,_PENELOPE._,"Nay, for thy spirit is gentle: yet ask me not"
8425,_PENELOPE._,"Thus of myself, for I have seen much woe:"
8426,_PENELOPE._,And tears might flood my face; till thou perchance
8427,_PENELOPE._,"Shouldst think my temper soft, or drowned in wine."
8428,_PENELOPE._,
8429,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Whate’er my fame, stranger, it lacketh much"
8430,_PENELOPE._,In losing of my lord; if he were here                           1911
8431,_PENELOPE._,Then I were proud. But ’tis of him we speak.
8432,_PENELOPE._,"Tell me then whence thou art, and what thou knowest."
8433,_PENELOPE._,
8434,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ If tell I must: there is a beauteous isle,"
8435,_PENELOPE._,"Which men call Crete, washed by the Libyan sea:"
8436,_PENELOPE._,"Ninety fair cities hath it, and the men"
8437,_PENELOPE._,"Who dwell there are of various race, Achæans,"
8438,_PENELOPE._,"Cydonians, Dorians, and Pelasgians,"
8439,_PENELOPE._,"Beside the native Cretan. There is Gnossus,"
8440,_PENELOPE._,"Where Minos dwelt, and took his law from Zeus:"
8441,_PENELOPE._,"He was my grandsire, and Deucalion                              1921"
8442,_PENELOPE._,"His son, my father, had another son"
8443,_PENELOPE._,"Idomeneus, elder and better gifted"
8444,_PENELOPE._,"Than I, who am callèd Æthon. Now it happed,"
8445,_PENELOPE._,"That when not many days, Idomeneus"
8446,_PENELOPE._,"Had sailed away for Troy, thy lord Ulysses,"
8447,_PENELOPE._,"Bound thither too, was driven aside to Crete,"
8448,_PENELOPE._,And sheltered at Amnisos; and when thence
8449,_PENELOPE._,"He sent up heralds to the king, as one"
8450,_PENELOPE._,"Whose welcome was assured, it fell to me                        1930"
8451,_PENELOPE._,"To play awhile my elder brother’s part,"
8452,_PENELOPE._,And entertain him and his men. Twelve days
8453,_PENELOPE._,"He stayed, for even so long the mad North wind"
8454,_PENELOPE._,"Abated not, but with such fury blew"
8455,_PENELOPE._,"That far from putting out, they scarce could keep"
8456,_PENELOPE._,Their feet on land: but on the thirteenth day
8457,_PENELOPE._,"It fell, and let them forth to sail for Troy."
8458,_PENELOPE._,
8459,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Friend then, if so thou art, that courtesy"
8460,_PENELOPE._,"Thus royal shewedst to my lord, forgive"
8461,_PENELOPE._,"My thought to prove thee, if indeed these things                1940"
8462,_PENELOPE._,"Were as thou sayest. When thou sawest my lord,"
8463,_PENELOPE._,"How was he clad, and what lords followed him?"
8464,_PENELOPE._,
8465,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ Lady, ’tis hard with such a time between"
8466,_PENELOPE._,"To say—’tis twenty years; and yet, methinks,"
8467,_PENELOPE._,"My memory shows him to me, as he was."
8468,_PENELOPE._,Thy lord Ulysses wore a purple robe
8469,_PENELOPE._,"Of double woof, and on the golden brooch,"
8470,_PENELOPE._,"Which two pins held, was wrought a rare device;"
8471,_PENELOPE._,"A hound that had o’ertaken a hunted fawn,"
8472,_PENELOPE._,Stood on’t and gazed: and none who saw the work
8473,_PENELOPE._,"But marvelled, so was nature done to life.                      1951"
8474,_PENELOPE._,"The linen too about his neck was bright,"
8475,_PENELOPE._,"And fine in tissue as the silvery coat,"
8476,_PENELOPE._,Which the lithe snake among the withered grass
8477,_PENELOPE._,"Leaves off unrent. Ay, and his squire I see,"
8478,_PENELOPE._,"A man round-shouldered, tanned, and curly-haired,"
8479,_PENELOPE._,"Eurybates, that was his name; and him"
8480,_PENELOPE._,Ulysses loved and honoured ’bove the rest.
8481,_PENELOPE._,
8482,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Now, stranger, for the shame, which thou hast found      1959"
8483,_PENELOPE._,"Within my halls, shalt thou find love and honour."
8484,_PENELOPE._,The garments which thou sawest are the garments
8485,_PENELOPE._,I gave to him myself: the golden brooch
8486,_PENELOPE._,"Of rare device I chose to be his jewel,"
8487,_PENELOPE._,On that accursed day when he set forth
8488,_PENELOPE._,"For evil Ilion, never to be named."
8489,_PENELOPE._,
8490,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ O honoured wife of great Laertes’ son,"
8491,_PENELOPE._,Waste not thy soul in weeping for thy lord!
8492,_PENELOPE._,
8493,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Hath sorrow taught thee, friend, that tears are vain?"
8494,_PENELOPE._,
8495,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ Love’s tokens were not given to man for nought.
8496,_PENELOPE._,
8497,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Blamest thou then a woman, if she weep"
8498,_PENELOPE._,Her lord’s decease?                                             1971
8499,_PENELOPE._,
8500,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._               Nay, many dames that mourn"
8501,_PENELOPE._,"Their lords fordone at Troy, lament unblamed."
8502,_PENELOPE._,
8503,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Then why say’st thou to me, weep not; who knowest"
8504,_PENELOPE._,"My loss so well, knewest so well my lord?"
8505,_PENELOPE._,
8506,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ Since thy lord lives, therefore I say weep not."
8507,_PENELOPE._,
8508,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ I knew that thou wouldst say Ulysses lives.
8509,_PENELOPE._,
8510,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ ’Tis to no purpose then I bring thee joy?
8511,_PENELOPE._,
8512,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Many have falsely brought this hope before.
8513,_PENELOPE._,
8514,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ And yet unwittingly they spake the truth.
8515,_PENELOPE._,Ulysses lives.
8516,_PENELOPE._,
8517,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._         Prince Æthon, if so thou be,                     1980"
8518,_PENELOPE._,"I came to hear thy tale, ’twas well begun:"
8519,_PENELOPE._,Shew proof as fair for what thou goest to tell.
8520,_PENELOPE._,
8521,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ Lady, indeed Ulysses lives, and now"
8522,_PENELOPE._,"He is in Thesprotia, as I lately heard,"
8523,_PENELOPE._,And gathers gifts and treasures as he comes:
8524,_PENELOPE._,"The which I saw, a kingly wealth, enough"
8525,_PENELOPE._,To dower his children’s children o’er and o’er.
8526,_PENELOPE._,"His brave companions all were gone, but he"
8527,_PENELOPE._,From untold perils was come out unscathed.
8528,_PENELOPE._,
8529,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Where learnedst thou this?                               1990
8530,_PENELOPE._,
8531,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._                             Being in Thesprotia
8532,_PENELOPE._,"Not many days ago, the good king Pheidon"
8533,_PENELOPE._,"Told me these things, and shewed me too a ship"
8534,_PENELOPE._,"For voyage stored, wherein he said Ulysses"
8535,_PENELOPE._,"Should shortly sail; and with him I had come,"
8536,_PENELOPE._,"But that a vessel there discharging corn,"
8537,_PENELOPE._,"Left for Dulichium, and gave me passage."
8538,_PENELOPE._,
8539,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Thou saw’st him not?
8540,_PENELOPE._,
8541,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._                       True, lady, I saw him not;"
8542,_PENELOPE._,"He had travelled to Dodona, to consult"
8543,_PENELOPE._,The oracle.
8544,_PENELOPE._,
8545,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._      Nay, and alas thou hast seen him"
8546,_PENELOPE._,Scarce later than have I.
8547,_PENELOPE._,
8548,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._                     May Zeus himself                      2000
8549,_PENELOPE._,"Be witness first, and then this kindly house"
8550,_PENELOPE._,"Of good Ulysses, whither I am come,"
8551,_PENELOPE._,He shall return to thee ere this moon change.
8552,_PENELOPE._,
8553,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ I thank thee, sir; and wish right well thy word"
8554,_PENELOPE._,"Might be accomplished: I would so reward thee,"
8555,_PENELOPE._,That all who looked on thee should call thee blessed.
8556,_PENELOPE._,But in my heart I know ’twill not be so;
8557,_PENELOPE._,Nor shew’st thou proof.
8558,_PENELOPE._,
8559,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._                   What of my oath?
8560,_PENELOPE._,
8561,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._                                   Indeed
8562,_PENELOPE._,"I doubt not thy good will, nor thy good faith;"
8563,_PENELOPE._,But nought can come of it; and much I fear                      2010
8564,_PENELOPE._,"That thou wilt scarce win escort from this house,"
8565,_PENELOPE._,So are its masters changed.
8566,_PENELOPE._,
8567,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._                       Mean as I am,"
8568,_PENELOPE._,I fear not them thou hintest; nor in thy house
8569,_PENELOPE._,"Will they dare hurt me. I will here remain,"
8570,_PENELOPE._,Until Ulysses comes.
8571,_PENELOPE._,
8572,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._               O, thou knowest little."
8573,_PENELOPE._,Now is the end. I’ll tell thee. When at first
8574,_PENELOPE._,"These princes came to woo me against my will,"
8575,_PENELOPE._,I put them off with guile; and some good spirit
8576,_PENELOPE._,"Prompting my heart, I set up in the hall"
8577,_PENELOPE._,"A loom, and rolled upon the beam a warp                         2020"
8578,_PENELOPE._,"Ample and long, and said _My lordly wooers,"
8579,_PENELOPE._,"Abide, nor press my marriage till this cloth"
8580,_PENELOPE._,"Be made, for I would weave the threads I span."
8581,_PENELOPE._,"’Tis old Laertes’ shroud, against the day"
8582,_PENELOPE._,"Which is not far, when death must take him hence."
8583,_PENELOPE._,"For since my lord is dead, I would not leave"
8584,_PENELOPE._,"His house, without this honour paid his sire._"
8585,_PENELOPE._,"And stealing thus their courteous consent,"
8586,_PENELOPE._,"I used by day to weave, but every night"
8587,_PENELOPE._,"Would silently creep down, and by the loom                      2030"
8588,_PENELOPE._,"Setting the torches, soon unravelling all,"
8589,_PENELOPE._,Undid the work of the day. Thus for three years
8590,_PENELOPE._,"I wove and prospered, and the web stood still:"
8591,_PENELOPE._,"But in the fourth, by blabbing of my maidens"
8592,_PENELOPE._,"Was all discovered, and since then I have known"
8593,_PENELOPE._,"Reproach, nor now can longer ’scape. My friends"
8594,_PENELOPE._,"And parents urge me, and my son himself,"
8595,_PENELOPE._,"Who once was with me, begs me leave the house,"
8596,_PENELOPE._,Ere his good father’s wealth be all consumed.
8597,_PENELOPE._,
8598,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ Well done of thee! Fear not. Ulysses cometh
8599,_PENELOPE._,To slay these robbers like a flock of sheep.                    2041
8600,_PENELOPE._,
8601,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Against conviction, friend, thy words are pleasant:"
8602,_PENELOPE._,None yet hath thus talked with me; and ere I go
8603,_PENELOPE._,"To sleep or weep upon my lonely couch,"
8604,_PENELOPE._,"I’ll tell thee of a dream I lately dreamed,"
8605,_PENELOPE._,"Much of thy meaning. There were twenty geese,"
8606,_PENELOPE._,"Which in the courtyard I had watched with pleasure,"
8607,_PENELOPE._,Raising their bills above their well-filled trough.
8608,_PENELOPE._,Now in my dream a furious eagle flew                            2049
8609,_PENELOPE._,"Down from the hills, and with his crooked beak"
8610,_PENELOPE._,"Brake all their necks, and killed them, and they lay"
8611,_PENELOPE._,Strewn in the yard; but he flew off to heaven.
8612,_PENELOPE._,"Then cried I out, as in my sleep it seemed,"
8613,_PENELOPE._,"Aloud, and all my maidens came about me,"
8614,_PENELOPE._,And mourned with me my geese the eagle had killed.
8615,_PENELOPE._,"But he returned, and perching on the wall,"
8616,_PENELOPE._,"Spake in man’s voice to me and said,"
8617,_PENELOPE._,"_Fear not, O daughter of Icarius,"
8618,_PENELOPE._,"No dream thou sawest, but a vision true."
8619,_PENELOPE._,"The geese are all thy wooers, and the eagle_                    2060"
8620,_PENELOPE._,"_That was, am now thy husband safe returned,"
8621,_PENELOPE._,Who will slay all those men as thou hast seen._
8622,_PENELOPE._,"Thus spake he, and I awaked; and looking forth"
8623,_PENELOPE._,"I saw my geese all standing by the trough,"
8624,_PENELOPE._,Eating the wheaten meal as heretofore.
8625,_PENELOPE._,
8626,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ Now blessed be the gods, who thus will visit"
8627,_PENELOPE._,In sleep the attentive spirits of them they love.
8628,_PENELOPE._,
8629,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Two gates there are in heaven of shadowy dreams,"
8630,_PENELOPE._,"One pair of ivory wrought, and one of horn:                     2069"
8631,_PENELOPE._,And dreams that through the ivory come to men
8632,_PENELOPE._,"Are cheating, and show things that shall not be;"
8633,_PENELOPE._,But such as through the polished horn fly down
8634,_PENELOPE._,Are true in issue to their glad beholders:
8635,_PENELOPE._,"But thence came not my strange dream as I fear,"
8636,_PENELOPE._,Welcome as ’twere to me and to my son.
8637,_PENELOPE._,
8638,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ The dream was true; the interpretation true.
8639,_PENELOPE._,"If yet thou doubt, me too a goddess sent"
8640,_PENELOPE._,"To warn thee of the thing, which thou, alas,"
8641,_PENELOPE._,"For weariness of hope and long misgiving,"
8642,_PENELOPE._,Art slow to hear.                                               2080
8643,_PENELOPE._,
8644,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._            What is man’s hope, good friend?"
8645,_PENELOPE._,"Is’t not a beggar in the land of doubt,"
8646,_PENELOPE._,Seeking as thou shelter and fire and food
8647,_PENELOPE._,"From day to day? and, while she finds a little,"
8648,_PENELOPE._,"She travels on, comforting life’s affections"
8649,_PENELOPE._,With scraps and crumbs fall’n from the dish of joy.
8650,_PENELOPE._,"’Tis thus hope lives, patient and pleasureless:"
8651,_PENELOPE._,But time will come when hope must die; she feels
8652,_PENELOPE._,"The gathering cold and creeping touch of death,"
8653,_PENELOPE._,And hath no thought but how to pass in peace.
8654,_PENELOPE._,"Even such my hope, agèd and white as thou,                      2090"
8655,_PENELOPE._,And near her term. Persist not! Rudely to arouse her
8656,_PENELOPE._,But hastens her sure end. Like in spent ashes
8657,_PENELOPE._,"Which fuel chokes, what little fire remains"
8658,_PENELOPE._,Burns best unmended.
8659,_PENELOPE._,
8660,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._                Thou wouldst wrong the gods,"
8661,_PENELOPE._,Who show such care for thee.
8662,_PENELOPE._,
8663,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._                       Friend, what to do?"
8664,_PENELOPE._,"To-morrow I had purposed—ah, evil morn!—"
8665,_PENELOPE._,"To end disorder, and to do a thing"
8666,_PENELOPE._,Should part me from this house. I had bethought me
8667,_PENELOPE._,"Of good Ulysses’ bow, to bring it forth,"
8668,_PENELOPE._,And make therewith a contest to the wooers;                     2100
8669,_PENELOPE._,"That if among them there was one could string it,"
8670,_PENELOPE._,And shoot an arrow thro’ the axes’ heads
8671,_PENELOPE._,"Set up in line as he was used to set them,"
8672,_PENELOPE._,"That that man I would marry,—and with him"
8673,_PENELOPE._,Quit my dear home for ever. Now thou say’st
8674,_PENELOPE._,"Ulysses comes, give me thy counsel, friend,"
8675,_PENELOPE._,If I should do this thing or wait awhile.
8676,_PENELOPE._,
8677,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ Lady, some god hath put it in thine heart:"
8678,_PENELOPE._,Set thou the axes up: Bring forth the bow:
8679,_PENELOPE._,Here is there none can bend it; and maybe                       2110
8680,_PENELOPE._,"That he, while they but strive with that same bow"
8681,_PENELOPE._,Shall work thee full revenge for all their wrongs.
8682,_PENELOPE._,
8683,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Bid’st thou me so?
8684,_PENELOPE._,
8685,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._                     Fear not! To-morrow morn
8686,_PENELOPE._,"Bring forth the bow, the axes, and the arrows."
8687,_PENELOPE._,
8688,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ And shall I marry him who shooteth true?
8689,_PENELOPE._,
8690,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._ Thou shalt find here no archer like thy lord.
8691,_PENELOPE._,
8692,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Then will the bow be offered them in vain?
8693,_PENELOPE._,
8694,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ More than in vain for them, but not for thee."
8695,_PENELOPE._,
8696,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ Be it so. Yet would I that pure Artemis
8697,_PENELOPE._,"Might give me an easy death in sleep this night,"
8698,_PENELOPE._,Even now; that I no more in sorrow of heart                     2121
8699,_PENELOPE._,"Should waste my life, longing for my dear lord’s"
8700,_PENELOPE._,Manifold excellence.
8701,_PENELOPE._,
8702,_PENELOPE._,_Ul._                Thy constant love
8703,_PENELOPE._,Is witness that he lives. A rootless flower
8704,_PENELOPE._,Blooms not so long. Be sure that he will come.
8705,_PENELOPE._,
8706,_PENELOPE._,"_Pen._ Friend, all thy words console me: wert thou willing"
8707,_PENELOPE._,"I could sit here by thee, nor wish for sleep."
8708,_PENELOPE._,But ’tis full time I leave. I go to send
8709,_PENELOPE._,One to strew bedding for thee.—
8710,_PENELOPE._,
8711,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._                            Beseech thee, lady,"
8712,_PENELOPE._,I’ll lay me on this fleece and take my rest.                    2130
8713,_PENELOPE._,A beggar such as I needeth no more.
8714,_PENELOPE._,
8715,_PENELOPE._,_Pen._ The god of sleep visit thee soon. Farewell.
8716,_PENELOPE._,
8717,_PENELOPE._,"_Ul._ Lady, good-night."
8718,_PENELOPE._,
8719,_PENELOPE._,[_Exit Penelope. The firelight is failing._
8720,_PENELOPE._,
8721,_PENELOPE._,"Now could I weep, and from the springs of pity"
8722,_PENELOPE._,"Forgive some wrong. Yet in the goddess’ hest,"
8723,_PENELOPE._,Away my softness! Surely in these things
8724,_PENELOPE._,"Is her hand seen. My bow! ay, from that bow"
8725,_PENELOPE._,The arrows were not wont to fly in vain.
8726,_PENELOPE._,"But now to find my son, my trust in him"
8727,_PENELOPE._,Hath grown with this day’s doings.                              2140
8728,_PENELOPE._,
8729,_PENELOPE._,_Enter in the gallery above Maids whispering and tittering._
8730,_PENELOPE._,
8731,_MAIDS._,_MAIDS._
8732,_MAIDS._,
8733,_MAIDS._,See there he sits—
8734,_MAIDS._,Hush! hush!
8735,_MAIDS._,He talketh to the fire—
8736,_MAIDS._,’Cause of his wandering wits.—
8737,_MAIDS._,He! he! he! he!
8738,_MAIDS._,What makes he here?—
8739,_MAIDS._,He hath come over sea
8740,_MAIDS._,With old tales of the sire.—
8741,_MAIDS._,Why who would lend him ear?
8742,_MAIDS._,He! he!                                                     2150
8743,_MAIDS._,How could the prince give heed?—
8744,_MAIDS._,How can our lady trust
8745,_MAIDS._,This object of disgust?—
8746,_MAIDS._,Or how hath she agreed
8747,_MAIDS._,To take him here among
8748,_MAIDS._,The wooers as her guest?
8749,_MAIDS._,"Half crazed too, I’ll be bound—"
8750,_MAIDS._,He! he! he! he!
8751,_MAIDS._,"And treat him like the rest,"
8752,_MAIDS._,So noble all and young?                                         2160
8753,_MAIDS._,Hush! hush!
8754,_MAIDS._,His old bones creak!
8755,_MAIDS._,Hush! hush!
8756,_MAIDS._,"He looks, he turns around,"
8757,_MAIDS._,"He sees us, he will speak."
8758,_MAIDS._,Hush!
8759,_MAIDS._,
8760,_MAIDS._,"_Ul._ Ye miserable women, accurst of fate,"
8761,_MAIDS._,Unknowing on the eve of doom ye are come
8762,_MAIDS._,To anger justice. Go! your wanton lovers
8763,_MAIDS._,Are gone; ye never shall concern them more.                     2170
8764,_MAIDS._,"Nor none of them, nor ye that mock old men"
8765,_MAIDS._,Shall know what ’tis to have grey hairs. Begone!
8766,_MAIDS._,"For when Ulysses cometh, as men hang"
8767,_MAIDS._,"Bunches of grapes upon a string to dry,"
8768,_MAIDS._,So shall he set you dangling in the court
8769,_MAIDS._,By your white necks. Fly to your chambers! Fly!
8770,_MAIDS._,Ulysses comes.
8771,_MAIDS._,
8772,_MAIDS._,"_Maids._ Ah, ah, ah! Mercy on us!                        [_Exeunt._"
8773,_MAIDS._,
8774,_MAIDS._,_Ul._ Now first to find my son. If I dare call.
8775,_MAIDS._,
8776,_MAIDS._,[_Goes to_ L.
8777,_MAIDS._,
8778,_MAIDS._,Softly—Telemachus!—Telemachus!
8779,_MAIDS._,
8780,_MAIDS._,_Tel._ (_enters_ L.). Father.                                   2180
8781,_MAIDS._,
8782,_MAIDS._,"_Ul._                         Speak softly, son, lest any hear."
8783,_MAIDS._,The goddess guides us well. The plot is laid:
8784,_MAIDS._,’Tis but to tell it thee. I have won thy mother
8785,_MAIDS._,"To confidence, tho’ yet she knows me not."
8786,_MAIDS._,"To-morrow morn will she bring forth my bow,"
8787,_MAIDS._,"And make therewith a contest for the wooers,"
8788,_MAIDS._,"Pledging to marry him who strings the bow,"
8789,_MAIDS._,And shoots an arrow through the axes’ heads.
8790,_MAIDS._,"Now thou must set them up, as I will shew thee,"
8791,_MAIDS._,In the outer court; that they who come to shoot
8792,_MAIDS._,"May stand where we are standing—as I was wont,—"
8793,_MAIDS._,Sending the arrows thro’ the open doorway.                      2191
8794,_MAIDS._,"But when ’tis seen that none can string the bow,"
8795,_MAIDS._,"Then I shall take it, and be that our sign."
8796,_MAIDS._,"With the first shaft I loose a foe will fall,"
8797,_MAIDS._,"And war begins; and when I speak my name,"
8798,_MAIDS._,"Thou and Eumæus join me; for the rest,"
8799,_MAIDS._,Soon will they fly for safety to the court:
8800,_MAIDS._,But let its outer gate be barred; then we
8801,_MAIDS._,"Here at the doorway can at leisure aim,"
8802,_MAIDS._,Nor fear not any numbers. Learn thy part:                       2200
8803,_MAIDS._,"To bar the gate of the court on the outer side,"
8804,_MAIDS._,"To close the postern, and set up the axes."
8805,_MAIDS._,"And have good care their heads sit loose upon them,"
8806,_MAIDS._,Nor bound unto the shafts; else might they serve
8807,_MAIDS._,For arms against us. As for other weapons
8808,_MAIDS._,They bear not many: those that here be hung
8809,_MAIDS._,"Upon the walls, must we take down and hide."
8810,_MAIDS._,"Which, if thou help me now, may soon be done."
8811,_MAIDS._,"First let me put this blazing log aside,"
8812,_MAIDS._,Lest light betray us.
8813,_MAIDS._,
8814,_MAIDS._,"_Tel._                Father, how shall we see                  2210"
8815,_MAIDS._,To move the arms?
8816,_MAIDS._,
8817,_MAIDS._,_Ul._             Now had the goddess made me
8818,_MAIDS._,"As blind as old, I should not need to grope"
8819,_MAIDS._,"In my own house: and all, I have marked it well,"
8820,_MAIDS._,Hang where I hung them there: each spear and shield
8821,_MAIDS._,I know the touch and weight of.
8822,_MAIDS._,
8823,_MAIDS._,_Tel._                          None hath dared
8824,_MAIDS._,To change a thing.
8825,_MAIDS._,
8826,_MAIDS._,_Ul._              Lift off that shield.
8827,_MAIDS._,
8828,_MAIDS._,_Tel._                                   I have it.
8829,_MAIDS._,
8830,_MAIDS._,"_Ul._ And that and these. Have care, son, lest the bronze"
8831,_MAIDS._,Ring and betray us.
8832,_MAIDS._,
8833,_MAIDS._,"_Tel._              Now the helmet, father."
8834,_MAIDS._,
8835,_MAIDS._,"_Ul._ Reach me those spears above,"
8836,_MAIDS._,
8837,_MAIDS._,"_Tel._                             What is that light,"
8838,_MAIDS._,That dances so and plays about the beams?                       2220
8839,_MAIDS._,
8840,_MAIDS._,_Ul._ Now mayst thou see the goddess aiding us.
8841,_MAIDS._,
8842,_MAIDS._,_Tel._ It shimmers like the moonlight on the sea.
8843,_MAIDS._,
8844,_MAIDS._,"_Ul._ ’Tis the same fierce ethereal flame of heaven,"
8845,_MAIDS._,Which makes the lightning; but the wise Athenè
8846,_MAIDS._,Hath tamed it for her common servicings.
8847,_MAIDS._,Stay not to look on’t; ’tis to aid our work.
8848,_MAIDS._,
8849,_MAIDS._,_Tel._ ’Tis certain we shall prosper.
8850,_MAIDS._,
8851,_MAIDS._,"_Ul._                                 Take thou those,"
8852,_MAIDS._,I these. Follow me up the stair. Step slow
8853,_MAIDS._,And soft. Let nothing in thy burden shift.
8854,_MAIDS._,Come thou.
8855,_MAIDS._,
8856,_MAIDS._,_Tel._     I follow.
8857,_MAIDS._,

8915,_TELEMACHUS._,"But as thou without question me obeyest,"

8918,_TELEMACHUS._,
8919,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._              And will there be no mercy

8921,_TELEMACHUS._,
8922,_TELEMACHUS._,_Ul._ Such justice only as shall separate
8923,_TELEMACHUS._,The false from the innocent. If I should swerve
8924,_TELEMACHUS._,"Even in desire from what the goddess bade,"
8925,_TELEMACHUS._,She may desert me. Already hath my pity
8926,_TELEMACHUS._,Strained my obedience: yestereve I gave                         2270
8927,_TELEMACHUS._,Warning to fly to Lord Amphinomus;
8928,_TELEMACHUS._,"For which if I be blamed, what is our risk?"

8935,_TELEMACHUS._,
8936,_TELEMACHUS._,"_Ul._ O son, this shame stifles me. Where’s Eumæus?"
8937,_TELEMACHUS._,I incline to tell him.
8938,_TELEMACHUS._,
8939,_TELEMACHUS._,_Tel._                 And there is one besides                 2279
8940,_TELEMACHUS._,"Whom we may trust, the neatherd. When time came"
8941,_TELEMACHUS._,"To close the gate, I thought to take them with me."

8944,_TELEMACHUS._,"When none of all the lords can string the bow,"

8988,_CTESIPPUS._,

8993,_CTESIPPUS._,"’Twas found the arms, which in their place had hung"
8994,_CTESIPPUS._,"Untouched for twenty years, were much decayed"
8995,_CTESIPPUS._,"And perished by the smoke: they are set aside,"
8996,_CTESIPPUS._,Where they can be o’erlooked and cleansed from rust.

9010,_CTESIPPUS._,"Let me tell all. It being Apollo’s feast,"
9011,_CTESIPPUS._,"The queen, my mother, has decreed a trial"
9012,_CTESIPPUS._,Of shooting in his honour; and the axes                         2310
9013,_CTESIPPUS._,"Ye ask of, are the mark. She gives the prize:"
9014,_CTESIPPUS._,"The which, with the conditions of the contest,"
9015,_CTESIPPUS._,"She shall herself proclaim. Until she comes,"

9026,_CTESIPPUS._,"—The arrows, sir, are shot point blank"
9027,_CTESIPPUS._,Through the axes’ heads set up in rank.
9028,_CTESIPPUS._,"—And that is such a juggling feat,                              2320"
9029,_CTESIPPUS._,That when you do it you cannot see’t.

9042,_CTESIPPUS._,Missing thine aim thou madest a better throw
9043,_CTESIPPUS._,"Than was thy purpose. For by heaven I swear,"
9044,_CTESIPPUS._,"That hadst thou hit the stranger, at this moment"
9045,_CTESIPPUS._,"My spear were in thy body, and the gold                         2330"
9046,_CTESIPPUS._,"Thy father saveth for thy wedding-day,"
9047,_CTESIPPUS._,He should have spent upon thy funeral.
9048,_CTESIPPUS._,"Know henceforth all of you, what insolence"
9049,_CTESIPPUS._,"May look to meet from me. I have been a child,"
9050,_CTESIPPUS._,"And so ye have treated me; I am now a man,"
9051,_CTESIPPUS._,"Grant it or learn it. (_To Ul._) Old man, take thy seat."
9052,_CTESIPPUS._,
9053,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Wooers._ Now if Ulysses ne’er came back,"
9054,_CTESIPPUS._,We not for that a lord should lack:
9055,_CTESIPPUS._,So doth this son of his inherit
9056,_CTESIPPUS._,His masterful and haughty spirit.                               2340
9057,_CTESIPPUS._,
9058,_CTESIPPUS._,_Amph._ Silence acknowledgeth a true rebuke.
9059,_CTESIPPUS._,"There is nought to answer, lords: treat we this stranger"
9060,_CTESIPPUS._,With due respect. But to Telemachus
9061,_CTESIPPUS._,One word I speak in kindness. While hope was
9062,_CTESIPPUS._,"Ulysses might return, he did but well"
9063,_CTESIPPUS._,Discouraging our courtship of his mother;
9064,_CTESIPPUS._,"But now, when hope is gone and all agree"
9065,_CTESIPPUS._,"He never can return, the prince should join"
9066,_CTESIPPUS._,"To urge the queen that she delay no more,"
9067,_CTESIPPUS._,But wed the best man here: which were far better
9068,_CTESIPPUS._,"Both for himself and for his father’s honour,                   2351"
9069,_CTESIPPUS._,Than all this waste and rancour in his halls.
9070,_CTESIPPUS._,
9071,_CTESIPPUS._,"_Tel._ Nay, now by Zeus, and by my father’s griefs,"
9072,_CTESIPPUS._,In no wise do I stay my mother’s marriage.
9073,_CTESIPPUS._,Rather I urge her marry whom she will.
9074,_CTESIPPUS._,"But while she wills not, that one word of mine"
9075,_CTESIPPUS._,"Be breathed to drive her forth, the gods forbid."
9076,_CTESIPPUS._,"To her speak, not to me. Lo you, she is here."
9077,_CTESIPPUS._,
9078,_CTESIPPUS._,_Wooers._ The queen! silence! the queen!
9079,_CTESIPPUS._,

9086,_PENELOPE._,"Howe’er that be, attend. Ye have now long time"
9087,_PENELOPE._,"Besieged this widowed house, and day by day"
9088,_PENELOPE._,"Eating and drinking without end, abused"
9089,_PENELOPE._,The absence of its lord; and ever in all
9090,_PENELOPE._,"Ye have still proclaimed one object, me to woo"
9091,_PENELOPE._,And wed. Till now I have barred consent: to-day
9092,_PENELOPE._,I yield me to your urgence to declare
9093,_PENELOPE._,Whom I will choose: but since not willingly
9094,_PENELOPE._,"I wed, I set my fortune with the gods                           2370"
9095,_PENELOPE._,To guide and govern. Here is Ulysses’ bow:
9096,_PENELOPE._,"With this contest, I pray you, among yourselves,"
9097,_PENELOPE._,"And I will be the prize. Yes, his am I"
9098,_PENELOPE._,"Who strings most easily this bow, and shoots"
9099,_PENELOPE._,The truest arrow through the axes’ heads.
9100,_PENELOPE._,He is my husband and with him to day
9101,_PENELOPE._,Will I leave this fair house so dearly loved.
9102,_PENELOPE._,"Eumæus, take the bow. Offer it now"
9103,_PENELOPE._,In turn to all: and let all try in turn;
9104,_PENELOPE._,I will sit here and watch.

9117,_NEATHERD._,"Obey. Why weep ye, fools? Your lady needs"
9118,_NEATHERD._,"Encouragement, not pity. Swift obey,"
9119,_NEATHERD._,"Or take your tears without, and leave the bow"
9120,_NEATHERD._,"To us for whom the prize is;—a prize, my lords,"
9121,_NEATHERD._,Not lightly to be taken; for none I think
9122,_NEATHERD._,Will bend it as Ulysses did: none here
9123,_NEATHERD._,"Is like the man, as I remember him"
9124,_NEATHERD._,"Long years ago, when I was but a lad.                           2390"

9126,_NEATHERD._,"_Tel._ Stay; are all here? This trial being for all,"

9139,_NEATHERD._,All share the chance.—It goes for nought
9140,_NEATHERD._,To have boasted favour. They that brought
9141,_NEATHERD._,The costliest gifts have spent in vain.—
9142,_NEATHERD._,"Now we may laugh, sirs.—Some that sought                        2400"
9143,_NEATHERD._,To overawe our equal claim
9144,_NEATHERD._,Are answered well.—I ever thought
9145,_NEATHERD._,She was a wise and honest dame.                        [_They sit._
9146,_NEATHERD._,

9150,_NEATHERD._,
9151,_NEATHERD._,"_Tel._ Come forth in turn then, and assay the bow."
9152,_NEATHERD._,I think Zeus robs me of my wits.—I laugh:
9153,_NEATHERD._,"’Tis true I laugh.—Ye understand, my lords,"
9154,_NEATHERD._,My wise and honoured mother hath declared
9155,_NEATHERD._,"That she will wed a stranger, and go forth                      2410"
9156,_NEATHERD._,And leave this house:—and I laugh and am glad!
9157,_NEATHERD._,"Come then, I say; seeing this is the prize,"
9158,_NEATHERD._,A lady without rival in the land;
9159,_NEATHERD._,"What say I? Not in all the Achæan lands,"
9160,_NEATHERD._,"In sacred Pylos, Argos, or Mycenæ,"
9161,_NEATHERD._,"Or elsewhere. But ye know this, and indeed"
9162,_NEATHERD._,"Why should I praise my mother? Come, I call you;"
9163,_NEATHERD._,"Come forth, assay the bow. Who cometh first?"
9164,_NEATHERD._,"Why, now I see I am a fool; myself,"
9165,_NEATHERD._,"Why not myself? If I should string it best,                     2420"
9166,_NEATHERD._,"And easiest, and shoot truest at the mark,"
9167,_NEATHERD._,Then I reserve the prize: my lady mother
9168,_NEATHERD._,"Will never quit these halls. Yes, and I think"
9169,_NEATHERD._,I have some phantom of my father’s strength.—
9170,_NEATHERD._,
9171,_NEATHERD._,"_Eur._ Nay, prince, this was not bargained."
9172,_NEATHERD._,
9173,_NEATHERD._,_Ant._                                      Let him try.

9176,_NEATHERD._,’Tis not for me. Ye be the mighty men:
9177,_NEATHERD._,I hand it you.

9179,_NEATHERD._,"_Eur._         Rise each in turn,"

9200,LEIODES.,’Twill prove our shame and death. Another take it.

9243,LEIODES.,
9244,LEIODES.,_The suitor_ (_2nd competitor_). I cannot bend it.
9245,LEIODES.,
9246,LEIODES.,"_3rd._                           Go to, sir, give it me."
9247,LEIODES.,"Thou heldst it wrongly,—but thus.—                              2469"
9248,LEIODES.,
9249,LEIODES.,"_2nd._                               Ay, teach me, shew me!"
9250,LEIODES.,
9251,LEIODES.,"_3rd._ Ah! ah! ah! Nay, indeed it yieldeth not."
9252,LEIODES.,What is it made of? Were’t of Indian horn
9253,LEIODES.,I must have broke it. Bah! I have wrenched my back!
9254,LEIODES.,
9255,LEIODES.,"_Eur._ Sirs, ’tis my turn. Ye do us little honour."
9256,LEIODES.,"’Tis warm to the hand, and well hath drunk the oil."
9257,LEIODES.,Now be I first to string it.
9258,LEIODES.,
9259,LEIODES.,_Wooers._                    See!
9260,LEIODES.,See he will do it if any can.—
9261,LEIODES.,"He is the best, and so ’twill be.—"
9262,LEIODES.,He standeth firm: it yieldeth now.—
9263,LEIODES.,Well done! Eurymachus will win.—
9264,LEIODES.,See how his striving body strains!—                           2480
9265,LEIODES.,Fixed like the image of a man
9266,LEIODES.,In stone he stands.—Now for it!-The veins
9267,LEIODES.,Stand out upon his darkening brow.—
9268,LEIODES.,"It slowly yields.—He doth it—Nay,"
9269,LEIODES.,It slippeth back.—He giveth in.—
9270,LEIODES.,"He hath failed, he putteth it away."
9271,LEIODES.,
9272,LEIODES.,"_Eur._ My friends, I am hurt both for myself and all."
9273,LEIODES.,"And were there but this woman in the world,"
9274,LEIODES.,To miss her could but vex me as it doth.
9275,LEIODES.,"But others be there, and my grief is other.                     2490"
9276,LEIODES.,For that we came in strength so far behind
9277,LEIODES.,"The great Ulysses, that we could not string"
9278,LEIODES.,"His bow, will ring our shame in ears unborn."
9279,LEIODES.,
9280,LEIODES.,"_Ant._ That will not be, Eurymachus,—and thou know’st it."
9281,LEIODES.,"This is Apollo’s feast, and on such day"
9282,LEIODES.,Who should presume in archery? Sit down;
9283,LEIODES.,And let the bow and other gear abide.
9284,LEIODES.,"Meanwhile pour out libations to the god,"
9285,LEIODES.,"And make a sacrifice. To-morrow morn,"
9286,LEIODES.,"Be he appeased, we may with his good favour                     2500"
9287,LEIODES.,Find better fortune.
9288,LEIODES.,
9289,LEIODES.,"_Eur._               ’Tis well spoke, my lords."
9290,LEIODES.,Consent ye all?
9291,LEIODES.,
9292,LEIODES.,"_Wooers._       Ay, ay."
9293,LEIODES.,
9294,LEIODES.,_Eur._                  Then be it so.
9295,LEIODES.,What saith our honoured lady?
9296,LEIODES.,
9297,LEIODES.,"_Pen._                        Well, my lords,"
9298,LEIODES.,’Tis an untoward ending. Shall I think
9299,LEIODES.,"Ye will not, or ye cannot?"
9300,LEIODES.,
9301,LEIODES.,_Eur._                     Be content
9302,LEIODES.,"To wait but till to-morrow, we beseech thee.—"
9303,LEIODES.,Bring round the wine.
9304,LEIODES.,
9305,LEIODES.,_Tel._ (_who has entered unperceived with Eum. and
9306,LEIODES.,"neatherd_).           Ho! men, take round the wine."
9307,LEIODES.,
9308,LEIODES.,_Eum._ Will they not need it?
9309,LEIODES.,
9310,LEIODES.,"_Ant._                        Thou impertinent swineherd,"
9311,LEIODES.,Go to thy pigs.
9312,LEIODES.,
9313,LEIODES.,"_Eum._          Ay, ay, my lord."
9314,LEIODES.,
9315,LEIODES.,"_Ul._                            Hear me,"
9316,LEIODES.,"Ye warriors, wooers of Ulysses’ queen,                          2510"
9317,LEIODES.,"And you, Antinous and Eurymachus"
9318,LEIODES.,"In chief! ’Tis well ye urge to stay the contest,"
9319,LEIODES.,"And pour libations, that the archer god"
9320,LEIODES.,To-morrow may grant strength to whom he will.
9321,LEIODES.,"But first give me the bow, that I may gauge"
9322,LEIODES.,"My strength with yours, to see if yet remains"
9323,LEIODES.,"Some muscle lithe of what once clothed my limbs,"
9324,LEIODES.,Or if ’tis withered all with age and want.
9325,LEIODES.,
9326,LEIODES.,_Wooers._ Ho! ho! The beggar thinks that he
9327,LEIODES.,Shall win the fair Penelope.                                    2520
9328,LEIODES.,
9329,LEIODES.,"_Ant._ Thou wretched fool, thou hast even less wit than hairs:"
9330,LEIODES.,Art not content in our high company
9331,LEIODES.,"To sit at ease, and have thy share, and hear"
9332,LEIODES.,"Our talk, and see our pleasure ’gainst our will?"
9333,LEIODES.,"The unwonted wine dilates what brains thou hast,"
9334,LEIODES.,To make thee think thou canst contend with us.
9335,LEIODES.,
9336,LEIODES.,"_Pen._ Antinous, I forbid this disrespect"
9337,LEIODES.,Before me of my guest: and by my life
9338,LEIODES.,Thou dost him wrong. To me he seems as tall
9339,LEIODES.,And strongly built as thou; he boasts to be                     2530
9340,LEIODES.,No less well born:—I grant him place and speech.
9341,LEIODES.,Thinkest thou if he string Ulysses’ bow
9342,LEIODES.,"That I should wed him?—Nay, nor he thinks that."
9343,LEIODES.,"Fret not yourselves, beseech you, with such fears."
9344,LEIODES.,
9345,LEIODES.,"_Eur._ Far be the thought, O wise Penelope:"
9346,LEIODES.,"And since he hath nought to gain, let him not try it:"
9347,LEIODES.,"Lest if he string it, men should say hereafter,"
9348,LEIODES.,"Naming our names, _The great bow of Ulysses"
9349,LEIODES.,"These could not handle, but a beggar strung it_.                2539"
9350,LEIODES.,
9351,LEIODES.,_Pen._ Look ye to future times for fair renown?
9352,LEIODES.,That hath been forfeit long. Stick not at this.
9353,LEIODES.,Give him the bow; he too shall have his prize.
9354,LEIODES.,"A king’s son is he: ay, and like a king"
9355,LEIODES.,From this house shall he issue clad and armed
9356,LEIODES.,"From head to foot, as are the best of you."
9357,LEIODES.,"I say, give him the bow."
9358,LEIODES.,
9359,LEIODES.,"_Tel._                   Mother, the bow is mine:"
9360,LEIODES.,"To give it or withhold it is my right,"
9361,LEIODES.,"And mine alone, which none can gainsay here."
9362,LEIODES.,"And choose I now to give it to this beggar,"
9363,LEIODES.,’Tis his to bear away for good and all.                         2550
9364,LEIODES.,"And what I will, that shall I do. To me"
9365,LEIODES.,"Therefore leave this dispute: to-day the trial,"
9366,LEIODES.,"Thou seest, is closed. Retire thou to thy chamber,"
9367,LEIODES.,And there at loom and distaff set thy maids their tasks.
9368,LEIODES.,"But this, which looks not like to be a lady’s matter,"
9369,LEIODES.,"Is mine, for mine is lordship in this house."
9370,LEIODES.,
9371,LEIODES.,"_Pen._ Well, son, then I shall go. Follow me, maids."
9372,LEIODES.,
9373,LEIODES.,[_Exit Pen. and maids._

9375,LEIODES.,CHOR. _Wooers._ What hath come o’er the prince? and why
9376,LEIODES.,Bids he his royal mother hence:
9377,LEIODES.,Pushing his haughty speech so high                              2560
9378,LEIODES.,"In strange, undutiful offence?"
9379,LEIODES.,
9380,LEIODES.,_Ul._ Bring me the bow that I may try my skill.
9381,LEIODES.,
9382,LEIODES.,"_Wooers_ (_to Eumæus_). Stay! man, stay!—Whither wilt thou go,"
9383,LEIODES.,Bearing the great resistless bow?
9384,LEIODES.,Stay. We will slay thee if thou dare!—
9385,LEIODES.,Forbear! Forbear!—
9386,LEIODES.,
9387,LEIODES.,_Tel._ Standest thou! servest thou so many masters?
9388,LEIODES.,"On man, and give it him: say thee nay who dares."
9389,LEIODES.,
9390,LEIODES.,_Wooers._ Ha! ha! he knows not what to do:
9391,LEIODES.,"Now he will go, and now he stands.—                             2570"
9392,LEIODES.,"Go, give it in the beggar’s hands.—"
9393,LEIODES.,"Ay, let him have it and welcome too.—"
9394,LEIODES.,"And thee, old man, may Fortune bless,"
9395,LEIODES.,As thou therewith shalt find success.
9396,LEIODES.,
9397,LEIODES.,"_Eum._ (_giving to Ul._). Master, O master!..."
9398,LEIODES.,
9399,LEIODES.,_Ul._ (_aside_).             Silence.—Now may Apollo
9400,LEIODES.,"Grant me but half the strength that once was mine,"
9401,LEIODES.,And ye shall see if I can bend a bow.
9402,LEIODES.,
9403,LEIODES.,"_Wooers._ By heaven, the beggar hath an eye.—"
9404,LEIODES.,He holds it as he knew the trick.—
9405,LEIODES.,Perchance he hath the like laid by                              2580
9406,LEIODES.,At home.—Or ’tis his thought to try
9407,LEIODES.,To fashion such another stick.—
9408,LEIODES.,He bends it at his will.—’Tis done!—
9409,LEIODES.,’Tis done!—He hath strung it.—See ’tis done.
9410,LEIODES.,
9411,LEIODES.,"_Ul._ Behold, prince, if I have not been wrongly"
9412,LEIODES.,scorned.
9413,LEIODES.,"Give me the arrows. Now they have seen my strength,"
9414,LEIODES.,These lords belike would have me prove my skill.
9415,LEIODES.,
9416,LEIODES.,_Wooers._ Now will he shoot? The villains bring
9417,LEIODES.,"The arrows.—Ay, he taketh one,"
9418,LEIODES.,To set it on the string.                                        2590
9419,LEIODES.,
9420,LEIODES.,_Ul._ Now is the irresoluble contest o’er:
9421,LEIODES.,Though what remains to do be not child’s play.
9422,LEIODES.,But I will hit a mark ye little think of.
9423,LEIODES.,Apollo aid me!                                   [_Shoots Antinous._

9425,LEIODES.,"_Wooers._      Ah! Ah! Beware, beware!"
9426,LEIODES.,
9427,LEIODES.,_Ant._ (_falling back_). Ah!
9428,LEIODES.,
9429,LEIODES.,"_Wooers_. Oh, madman! madman! Seize him!"
9430,LEIODES.,
9431,LEIODES.,"_Eur._                                   Man, what dost thou?"

9433,LEIODES.,_Amph._ What hast thou done? Thou’st slain a man.
9434,LEIODES.,
9435,LEIODES.,_Ctes._ O villain!
9436,LEIODES.,
9437,LEIODES.,_Wooers._ He’s dead. Antinous is slain.
9438,LEIODES.,
9439,LEIODES.,_Other wooers_ (_appearing at door_).   The lord Antinous is slain.
9440,LEIODES.,
9441,LEIODES.,"_Eur._ Foolhardy wretch, this murder is thy death."
9442,LEIODES.,"Whether unwittingly, or wittingly,                              2601"
9443,LEIODES.,It matters not: thou hast slain the noblest prince
9444,LEIODES.,Of the isle; and swiftly shall he be avenged.
9445,LEIODES.,
9446,LEIODES.,"_Ul._ (_leaping up to where Penelope had sat. Tel., Eum.,"
9447,LEIODES.,and neatherd join him_). Dogs! ye that said I never should return
9448,LEIODES.,"From Trojan soil: ye that would waste my house,"
9449,LEIODES.,And woo my wife while yet I was alive:
9450,LEIODES.,"Nor feared the gods in heav’n, nor shame of men:"
9451,LEIODES.,Now are the bonds of death made fast upon you.
9452,LEIODES.,I am Ulysses.

9457,LEIODES.,
9458,LEIODES.,"_Eur._ Stay, sir, awhile!"
9459,LEIODES.,

9461,LEIODES.,"’Tis he, fly! See the prince, and there"
9462,LEIODES.,"His two men—Speak, sir! speak him fair—"
9463,LEIODES.,
9464,LEIODES.,"_Eur._ Stay, sir, awhile, I pray thee. If thou indeed"
9465,LEIODES.,"Art he, the good Ulysses safe returned,"
9466,LEIODES.,"As by thy deeds and words thou makest to be,"
9467,LEIODES.,"Thou wilt hear reason, as thy speech is just."
9468,LEIODES.,’Tis true ill hath been done thee in house and field:
9469,LEIODES.,"But he lies dead, who was the chief in blame;"
9470,LEIODES.,"We may rejoice, for he brought all about,"
9471,LEIODES.,"Antinous, less eager for the marriage                           2620"
9472,LEIODES.,"Or dower, than in ambitious hope, now quenched,"
9473,LEIODES.,That he should reign in Ithaca:—to which end
9474,LEIODES.,"He would have killed the prince. But, he being dead,"
9475,LEIODES.,"Spare thou thy folk, sir, spare thine own; and we"
9476,LEIODES.,"For all wrong done thee will repay in full,"
9477,LEIODES.,"Each one in answer for waste hitherto,"

9479,LEIODES.,"And bronze and iron in plenty, till thy heart"

9483,LEIODES.,"What now thou hast, or after shouldst inherit,                  2631"
9484,LEIODES.,Could that be thine atonement; nor the like

9487,LEIODES.,"This choice ye have, to fight or fly; but flying"

9579,LEIODES.,"_2nd._                           O, but see thyself"
9580,LEIODES.,The deadly fight.
9581,LEIODES.,
9582,LEIODES.,_Pen._            I dare not look upon it.
9583,LEIODES.,Who fights ’gainst whom?
9584,LEIODES.,
9585,LEIODES.,_2nd._                   The beggar on the stair
9586,LEIODES.,"Deals death around, and by him stand the prince,"
9587,LEIODES.,"The neatherd, and Eumæus. Ah! he is struck!"
9588,LEIODES.,"Nay, nay. They keep all off with spear and shield."
9589,LEIODES.,
9590,LEIODES.,[_Cries without._
9591,LEIODES.,
9592,LEIODES.,"_Pen._ Alas, the shrieks of death. I faint, ho! help me."
9593,LEIODES.,Lead me to the chair.                                 [_Sits down._
9594,LEIODES.,
9595,LEIODES.,"_1st._                They may burst in: beseech thee,"
9596,LEIODES.,Back to thy chamber!                                            2681
9597,LEIODES.,
9598,LEIODES.,"_Pen._               Nay, if my son be safe."
9599,LEIODES.,"Watch there, and tell me.—Is he yet unhurt?"
9600,LEIODES.,
9601,LEIODES.,"_2nd._ They spring upon the beggar and the prince,"
9602,LEIODES.,"And as they spring, they are slain.—They lie in heaps."
9603,LEIODES.,
9604,LEIODES.,"_Pen._ Alas! what cries! Say, is the prince still safe?"
9605,LEIODES.,
9606,LEIODES.,"_2nd._ He shieldeth himself well, and striketh surely."
9607,LEIODES.,His foes fall dead before him. Ah! now what see I?
9608,LEIODES.,"Who cometh? Lo! a dazzling helm, a spear"
9609,LEIODES.,Of silver or electron; sharp and swift                          2690
9610,LEIODES.,"The piercings. How they fall. Ha, shields are raised"
9611,LEIODES.,"In vain. I am blinded, or the beggar-man"
9612,LEIODES.,"Hath waxed in strength. He is changed, he is young. O strange!"
9613,LEIODES.,"He is all in golden armour. These are gods,"
9614,LEIODES.,"That slay the wooers. (_Runs to Pen._) O lady, forgive me!"
9615,LEIODES.,’Tis Ares’ self. I saw his crispèd beard:
9616,LEIODES.,I saw beneath his helm his curling locks.
9617,LEIODES.,"None will escape. O lady, save me, save me.              [_Kneels._"
9618,LEIODES.,
9619,LEIODES.,_Maids all._ Let them not slay us. Lady! lady! forgive us!      2699
9620,LEIODES.,
9621,LEIODES.,"_Pen._ Why kneelest thou to me? Fools, why to me?"
9622,LEIODES.,I have nothing to forgive you. There is no wrong
9623,LEIODES.,"’Twixt me and you: Or if the gods should punish,"
9624,LEIODES.,Can I protect?
9625,LEIODES.,
9626,LEIODES.,"_Maids._       Forgive us, queen, forgive us!"
9627,LEIODES.,
9628,LEIODES.,_Pen._ I see ye are dazed—no wonder.—The thing is true
9629,LEIODES.,Ye say. The gods are come. I know it: I spake
9630,LEIODES.,With one myself unweeting: and he bade
9631,LEIODES.,Confront those robbers with the bow of death.
9632,LEIODES.,"That hath provoked our fate. Ah, cursèd day"
9633,LEIODES.,"The Greeks set forth for Troy. Accurst was Helen,"
9634,LEIODES.,"Accurst was Menelaus, Agamemnon                                 2710"
9635,LEIODES.,"Accurst, who o’er us drew a net of ill:"
9636,LEIODES.,"Whence since is no escape, no not for one."
9637,LEIODES.,"Not Ilion burned, not Greece made bare of men,"
9638,LEIODES.,"Not ten years’ war, nor to their widowed homes"
9639,LEIODES.,The barred return of heroes could suffice
9640,LEIODES.,"To fill the cup of evil, which the gods,"
9641,LEIODES.,"Dooming one deed of all the deeds of men,"
9642,LEIODES.,"The folly of one woman and one man,"
9643,LEIODES.,Have heaped upon us. Now the unending slaughter
9644,LEIODES.,"Falls on this house. Was joy, or woe, my crime?"
9645,LEIODES.,"To have had, or lost the best of all the Greeks?"
9646,LEIODES.,"My patience, watching twenty years, or now                      2722"
9647,LEIODES.,"To have yielded but a little? O ye high gods,"
9648,LEIODES.,"Smite all ill-doers; ay, smite me with death,"
9649,LEIODES.,"Triumphant Ares, if within my body,"
9650,LEIODES.,"My lord being dead, there is either hope or love"
9651,LEIODES.,"That may be callèd life. I would not live,"
9652,LEIODES.,I have no cause to live: but O my son—
9653,LEIODES.,Spare him!
9654,LEIODES.,
9655,LEIODES.,"_2nd Maid._ O lady, ’tis not him, but us"
9656,LEIODES.,Ares will slay.
9657,LEIODES.,
9658,LEIODES.,"_Pen._          Look, look again."
9659,LEIODES.,
9660,LEIODES.,_2nd._                            I fear.                       2730
9661,LEIODES.,’Tis now more dread than ever. The cries have ceased.
9662,LEIODES.,
9663,LEIODES.,"_Pen._ Hush, hark—ay, all is still. Look forth, I say."
9664,LEIODES.,
9665,LEIODES.,"_Re-enter Tel., Eum., and neatherd._"

9681,LEIODES.,"_Pen._   Son, son!"
9682,LEIODES.,
9683,LEIODES.,_Tel._             He hath returned—’Tis true—
9684,LEIODES.,And in his vengeance slain them all.
9685,LEIODES.,
9686,LEIODES.,_Pen._                               What say’st thou?
9687,LEIODES.,
9688,LEIODES.,"_Tel._ Mother, believe: our sorrow is o’er. ’Tis he,"
9689,LEIODES.,"The man disguised, who spake with thee last night:"

9691,LEIODES.,
9692,LEIODES.,"_Eum._           O lady, ’tis the master,                       2740"

9702,LEIODES.,
9703,LEIODES.,_Tel._ She learned her joy too quickly. As I spake
9704,LEIODES.,She fell back swooning.
9705,LEIODES.,
9706,LEIODES.,_Ul._                   Watch by her awhile.
9707,LEIODES.,"(_To Eum. and neatherd._) Drag ye these bodies forth,"

9709,LEIODES.,That there be nought to shock her wakening sense.
9710,LEIODES.,And all ye maids begone. I know to winnow
9711,LEIODES.,Good wheat from chaff: and what I spake to you
9712,LEIODES.,"Shall be to-day accomplished. (_Exeunt Maids._) Ha,"
9713,LEIODES.,what see I?                                                2751

9717,LEIODES.,_Phem._ (_appearing from under skins_). O my good lord
9718,LEIODES.,"and master,"
9719,LEIODES.,Have pity upon me.
9720,LEIODES.,
9721,LEIODES.,"_Ul._ (_to Eum._). Take him to the court,"
9722,LEIODES.,And slay him there.
9723,LEIODES.,
9724,LEIODES.,"_Phem._             Master, have pity on me:"

9726,LEIODES.,
9727,LEIODES.,"_Tel._ Father, I plead for him: ’tis Phemius."

9729,LEIODES.,
9730,LEIODES.,"_Ul._      Well, be thou spared;—the only one—"
9731,LEIODES.,"And live to tell the tale. See, ’tis thy trade."
9732,LEIODES.,Go from the hall.                   [_Exeunt Phemius and neatherd._
9733,LEIODES.,"(_To Tel._)       Now all is ready, son:                        2760"
9734,LEIODES.,Doth she not wake?
9735,LEIODES.,
9736,LEIODES.,"_Tel._             Ay, now I think she awakes."
9737,LEIODES.,
9738,LEIODES.,"_Ul._ Stand thou in sight. Now, dearest wife, awake!"
9739,LEIODES.,"Wife, wife, awake! That word and in my voice"
9740,LEIODES.,Should call thee from the grave. Dost thou not hear?
9741,LEIODES.,
9742,LEIODES.,_Pen._ Who spake?
9743,LEIODES.,
9744,LEIODES.,_Ul._             I speak to thee again.

9800,I,The fragment of Æschylus on the title (see List of previous Editions)
9801,I,suggests a truly ancient origin for the family of Palicio: its known
9802,I,history is given in the _Nobiliario viceregio capitaniale e pretoriano

9817,II,"Since the publication of PALICIO, unexpected light has been thrown on"
9818,II,the married history of _Palicio_ and _Margaret_. It would seem that
9819,II,"they had a son, who was probably named after his maternal uncle, the"
9820,II,"chief Justiciary: for in March 1891 a half-witted Sicilian, named"
9821,II,"_Manuel Palizzi_, or _Palicio_, was among the Italians who were"
9822,II,"executed by the mob in _New Orleans_, for being concerned in the"
9823,II,murder of the head of the police. Though the mental condition of this
9824,II,"unfortunate fellow was such as to make his responsibility questionable,"
9825,II,"yet his connection with the _Mafia_ society, and with their motives"
9826,II,"and crimes, points, as unmistakably as his name, to his ancestor in"
9827,II,"my play, terribly degraded though he was in body as in mind. It is"
9828,II,possible that some of our fanatical anarchists may be similarly the
9829,II,"prey of a depraved atavism, and be impelled by a fermentation of the"
9830,II,sour dregs of an old puritanic heroism. I hope that the family is
9831,II,now extinct. The late _Professor Freeman_ in the introduction to his
9832,II,"_History of Sicily_, contributed to the literature of my play, by"
9833,II,giving a careful and full account of what I assumed to be the origin of
9834,II,the family name.

9840,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,
9841,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"This play, being a dramatising of the chief scenes in Homer’s"
9842,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"_Odyssey_, and not a recast of the story in dramatic form, is as"
9843,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"a stage-play open to evident objections; to which, if it be not"
9844,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"successful, there can be no answer. How closely Homer has been followed"
9845,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"need not be pointed out, as translations of the _Odyssey_ are common,"
9846,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,and the recent accurate version by _Mr. Lang_ is in every one’s
9847,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"reach. Reference to that will measure the author’s fidelity, and show"
9848,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"where he has altered, where added; and it may also excuse him from"
9849,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"any acknowledgment of obligation to his friend, beyond the general"
9850,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,confession that he has borrowed from his book whenever it suited him to
9851,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,do so.
9852,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,
9853,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,It was necessary for the play to make the hall of Ulysses’ house
9854,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,different from its description in the _Odyssey_; and considering the
9855,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"disagreement of critics as to Homer’s meaning, this was a matter"
9856,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,of less regret. The hall required for the last three acts has the
9857,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"following necessary parts. Of the three walls the back wall has,"
9858,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"running along it at a convenient height, a practicable _gallery_,"
9859,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,which communicates at either end with the upper rooms. This gallery
9860,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"joins in the left corner a short _staircase_ against the left wall,"
9861,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"leading down to the hall, not so far as to the floor, but ending on"
9862,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"a daïs-like _platform_, which is raised two or three feet above the"
9863,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,rest of the floor. This is the elevation on which Penelope sits to
9864,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"receive the gifts, and on to which Ulysses leaps when he makes himself"
9865,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,known. It has steps also down from it to the floor of the hall. The
9866,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"gallery spoken of is supported by pillars, behind which a bench for"
9867,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,the suitors runs along the wall; and this arrangement may follow round
9868,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,what is seen of the right wall of the room. But the centre of the back
9869,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,wall is broken by the _doorway_ which leads into the outer court: its
9870,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,threshold is three steps above the floor of the hall; it has double
9871,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"folding-doors, through which, if they are open, the _outer court_ may"
9872,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,be seen; and this outer court is on a higher level than the inner hall.
9873,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,The _postern gate_ is in the right back corner. The _fireplace_ is at
9874,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,the right front.
9875,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,
9876,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"With this skeleton given, the text is clearly descriptive of all the"
9877,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,disposition; but there is one stage direction it may be well to add:
9878,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"that is, that the _chair_, in which Penelope sits on the daïs to watch"
9879,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,"the contest with the bow, is thrown down on the floor of the hall in"
9880,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,the fighting when Eurymachus is killed; and is set up for her there in
9881,THE RETURN OF ULYSSES,the centre of the stage by one of the maids for the last scenes.
