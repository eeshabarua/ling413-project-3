58,INTRODUCTORY.,
59,INTRODUCTORY.,
60,INTRODUCTORY.,The name of Robert Browning has been before the world now for fifty
61,INTRODUCTORY.,years. For the greater part of the time his work has had so little
62,INTRODUCTORY.,"recognition, that one marvels at his courage in going so steadily on"
63,INTRODUCTORY.,"with it. His “Pomegranates” have been produced year after year, decade"
64,INTRODUCTORY.,"after decade, in unfailing abundance; and, while critics have kept"
65,INTRODUCTORY.,"paring at the rind, and the general public has not even asked if there"
66,INTRODUCTORY.,"was anything beneath it, he has laboured on with unremitting energy,"
67,INTRODUCTORY.,"calmly awaiting the time when “the heart within, blood-tinctured, of a"
68,INTRODUCTORY.,"veined humanity,” should be at length discovered. It can scarcely be"
69,INTRODUCTORY.,"said, even yet, that that time has come; but it is coming fast. Already"
70,INTRODUCTORY.,he is something more than “the poet’s poet.” Few intelligent people now
71,INTRODUCTORY.,are content to know one of the master minds of the age simply as the
72,INTRODUCTORY.,"author of “The Pied Piper of Hamelin,” as if that were the only thing he"
73,INTRODUCTORY.,had written worth reading!
74,INTRODUCTORY.,
75,INTRODUCTORY.,That the form in which the thought of Browning is cast is altogether
76,INTRODUCTORY.,"admirable, is what none but his most undiscriminating admirers will"
77,INTRODUCTORY.,"assert. It is often, unquestionably, rough and forbidding. But there is"
78,INTRODUCTORY.,strength even in its ruggedness; and in its entire freedom from
79,INTRODUCTORY.,conventionality there is a charm such as one enjoys in wild mountain
80,INTRODUCTORY.,"scenery, even though only in little patches it may have any suggestion"
81,INTRODUCTORY.,of the garden or the lawn. There are those who have charged the poet
82,INTRODUCTORY.,with affectation of the uncouth and the bizarre; but careful reading
83,INTRODUCTORY.,"will, we think, render it apparent that it is rather his utter freedom"
84,INTRODUCTORY.,from affectation which determines and perpetuates the peculiarities and
85,INTRODUCTORY.,"oddities of his style; that, in fact, the aphorism of Buffon, “_le style"
86,INTRODUCTORY.,"est l’homme même_,” is undoubtedly true as applied to him. It would, of"
87,INTRODUCTORY.,"course, be absurd to claim for the pomegranate the bloom and beauty of"
88,INTRODUCTORY.,"the peach; but, equally with the other, it is Nature’s gift, and to toss"
89,INTRODUCTORY.,aside a rough-rinded fruit because it needs to be “cut deep down the
90,INTRODUCTORY.,"middle” before its pulp and juices can be reached, is surely far from"
91,INTRODUCTORY.,"wise. Even hard nuts are not to be despised, if the kernels are good;"
92,INTRODUCTORY.,"and as to Browning’s “nuts,” we have this to say, that not only are they"
93,INTRODUCTORY.,"well worth cracking, but there is in the process excellent exercise for"
94,INTRODUCTORY.,the teeth.
95,INTRODUCTORY.,
96,INTRODUCTORY.,"This brings us to the alleged “obscurity” of Browning’s writings, which"
97,INTRODUCTORY.,still continues to be the main obstacle to their general appreciation.
98,INTRODUCTORY.,"It is freely admitted that often it is not quite easy, and sometimes"
99,INTRODUCTORY.,"very difficult, to understand him; and it is hard for most people to see"
100,INTRODUCTORY.,"why he could not make his meaning plainer, and matter for regret to"
101,INTRODUCTORY.,"many, who heartily admire him, that he has not done so. That he has"
102,INTRODUCTORY.,taken some pains to this end is evident from what he says in the preface
103,INTRODUCTORY.,"to “Sordello,” written for an edition issued in 1863, twenty-three years"
104,INTRODUCTORY.,after its original publication: “My own faults of expression were
105,INTRODUCTORY.,"many.... I blame nobody, least of all myself, who did my best then and"
106,INTRODUCTORY.,"since, for I lately gave time and pains to turn my work into what the"
107,INTRODUCTORY.,many might—instead of what the few must—like.” In a later preface (1872)
108,INTRODUCTORY.,"he says, “Nor do I apprehend any more charges of being wilfully obscure,"
109,INTRODUCTORY.,"unconscientiously careless, or perversely harsh.” The true explanation"
110,INTRODUCTORY.,"of it seems to be what we have already suggested, that he does not think"
111,INTRODUCTORY.,"of his audience as he writes, his only care being to express the thought"
112,INTRODUCTORY.,"in the way which comes most natural to him. As a dramatist, he can throw"
113,INTRODUCTORY.,himself with abandonment into the persons he represents; but he never
114,INTRODUCTORY.,"seems to think of putting himself in the position of a listener, or, if"
115,INTRODUCTORY.,"he does, he assumes too readily that he has a mind of similar texture"
116,INTRODUCTORY.,"and grasp to his own. On the other hand, it is fair to say that the"
117,INTRODUCTORY.,difficulty of understanding him arises in great part from the very
118,INTRODUCTORY.,excellence of his work. The following considerations will illustrate
119,INTRODUCTORY.,what we mean:—
120,INTRODUCTORY.,
121,INTRODUCTORY.,"1. His work is full of _thought_, and the thought is never commonplace."
122,INTRODUCTORY.,"There is so much of it, and all is so fresh, and therefore unfamiliar,"
123,INTRODUCTORY.,that some mental effort is necessary to grasp it. The following
124,INTRODUCTORY.,"characteristic remark of Bishop Butler, in his preface to the famous"
125,INTRODUCTORY.,"Fifteen Sermons, is worth consideration in this connection: “It must be"
126,INTRODUCTORY.,acknowledged that some of the following Discourses are very abstruse and
127,INTRODUCTORY.,"difficult; or, if you please, obscure; but I must take leave to add that"
128,INTRODUCTORY.,"those alone are judges, whether or no and how far this is a fault, who"
129,INTRODUCTORY.,"are judges, whether or no and how far it might have been avoided—those"
130,INTRODUCTORY.,"only who will be at the trouble to understand what is here said, and to"
131,INTRODUCTORY.,"see how far the things here insisted upon, and not other things, might"
132,INTRODUCTORY.,have been put in a plainer manner; which yet I am very far from
133,INTRODUCTORY.,asserting that they could not.”
134,INTRODUCTORY.,
135,INTRODUCTORY.,"2. The expression is always the briefest. Not only are no words wasted,"
136,INTRODUCTORY.,"but, where connecting ideas are easily supplied, they are often left"
137,INTRODUCTORY.,"unexpressed, the intelligence and mental activity of the reader being"
138,INTRODUCTORY.,always taken for granted.
139,INTRODUCTORY.,
140,INTRODUCTORY.,"3. The poems are, for the most part, dramatic in principle. The reader"
141,INTRODUCTORY.,"is brought face to face with some soul, in its thoughts and emotions,"
142,INTRODUCTORY.,frequently in the very process of the thinking and the feeling. The poet
143,INTRODUCTORY.,"has stepped aside, and of course supplies no key. The author does not"
144,INTRODUCTORY.,"appear, like the chorus in a Greek play, to point a moral or explain the"
145,INTRODUCTORY.,"situation. The _dramatis personæ_ must explain themselves. And, just as"
146,INTRODUCTORY.,Shakespeare must be _studied_ in order to an appreciation other than
147,INTRODUCTORY.,"second-hand, so must Browning be studied in order to be appreciated at"
148,INTRODUCTORY.,all; for his writings are not yet old enough to secure much second-hand
149,INTRODUCTORY.,enthusiasm.
150,INTRODUCTORY.,
151,INTRODUCTORY.,4. The wealth of allusion is another source of difficulty. The learning
152,INTRODUCTORY.,"of our poet is encyclopædic; and though there is no display of it, there"
153,INTRODUCTORY.,"is large use of it; and it often happens that passages or phrases, which"
154,INTRODUCTORY.,"seem crabbed or obscure, require only the knowledge of some unfamiliar"
155,INTRODUCTORY.,"fact in science or in history, or it may be something not readily"
156,INTRODUCTORY.,"thought of, and yet within easy range of a keen enough observation, to"
157,INTRODUCTORY.,light them up and reveal unsuspected strength or beauty.
158,INTRODUCTORY.,
159,INTRODUCTORY.,Before leaving the subject of the rough and often tough exterior of
160,INTRODUCTORY.,"Browning’s work, it may be interesting to refer to the characteristic"
161,INTRODUCTORY.,illustration of it he has lately given us in the prologue to
162,INTRODUCTORY.,"“Ferishtah’s Fancies,” his most recent work. He begins by asking the"
163,INTRODUCTORY.,"reader whether he has ever “eaten ortolans in Italy,” and then goes on"
164,INTRODUCTORY.,to describe the preparation of them. The following lines will show the
165,INTRODUCTORY.,use he makes of the illustration:
166,INTRODUCTORY.,
167,INTRODUCTORY.,"“First comes plain bread, crisp, brown, a toasted square;"
168,INTRODUCTORY.,"Then, a strong sage-leaf;"
169,INTRODUCTORY.,(So we find books with flowers dried here and there
170,INTRODUCTORY.,Lest leaf engage leaf.)
171,INTRODUCTORY.,"First, food—then, piquancy—and last of all"
172,INTRODUCTORY.,Follows the thirdling;
173,INTRODUCTORY.,"Through wholesome hard, sharp soft, your tooth must bite"
174,INTRODUCTORY.,Ere reach the birdling.
175,INTRODUCTORY.,"Now, were there only crust to crunch, you’d wince:"
176,INTRODUCTORY.,Unpalatable!
177,INTRODUCTORY.,Sage-leaf is bitter-pungent—so’s a quince;
178,INTRODUCTORY.,Eat each who’s able!
179,INTRODUCTORY.,"But through all three bite boldly—lo, the gust!"
180,INTRODUCTORY.,Flavour—no fixture—
181,INTRODUCTORY.,Flies permeating flesh and leaf and crust
182,INTRODUCTORY.,In fine admixture.
183,INTRODUCTORY.,"So with your meal, my poem; masticate"
184,INTRODUCTORY.,"Sense, sight and song there!"
185,INTRODUCTORY.,"Digest these, and I praise your peptics’ state,"
186,INTRODUCTORY.,Nothing found wrong there.”
187,INTRODUCTORY.,
188,INTRODUCTORY.,This extract also furnishes an example of the strange rhymes in which
189,INTRODUCTORY.,"the poet sometimes indulges, with what appears too little refinement of"
190,INTRODUCTORY.,taste.
191,INTRODUCTORY.,
192,INTRODUCTORY.,The themes of Browning’s poetry are the very greatest that can engage
193,INTRODUCTORY.,"the thought of man. He ranges over a vast variety of topic; but,"
194,INTRODUCTORY.,"wherever his thought may lead him, he never loses sight of that which is"
195,INTRODUCTORY.,"to him the centre of all, the human soul, with its infinite wants and"
196,INTRODUCTORY.,capabilities. In the preface to “Sordello” he says: “The historical
197,INTRODUCTORY.,decoration was purposely of no more importance than a background
198,INTRODUCTORY.,requires; and my stress lay on the incidents in the development of a
199,INTRODUCTORY.,"soul: little else is worth study. I, at least, always thought so.” To"
200,INTRODUCTORY.,this principle he has kept true through all his work; and hence it is
201,INTRODUCTORY.,"that, whether the particular subject be love, or home, or country;"
202,INTRODUCTORY.,"poetry, painting, or music; life, death, or immortality; it is dealt"
203,INTRODUCTORY.,with in its relation to “the development of a soul.” Hence it is that
204,INTRODUCTORY.,"his poetry is so thoroughly and profoundly spiritual, and so exceedingly"
205,INTRODUCTORY.,"valuable as a counteractive to the materialism of the age, which ever"
206,INTRODUCTORY.,"tends to merge the soul in the body, and swallow up the real in mere"
207,INTRODUCTORY.,phenomena.
208,INTRODUCTORY.,
209,INTRODUCTORY.,As might be expected of one who deals so profoundly with all that he
210,INTRODUCTORY.,"touches, the great reality of the universe to him is God. Agnosticism"
211,INTRODUCTORY.,"has little mercy at his hands; if a man knows anything at all, he knows"
212,INTRODUCTORY.,"God. And the God whom he knows is not a God apart, looking down from"
213,INTRODUCTORY.,"some infinite or indefinite height upon the world, but one in whom all"
214,INTRODUCTORY.,"live and move and have their being. Out of this springs, of course, the"
215,INTRODUCTORY.,"hope of immortality, and also that bright and cheerful view of life so"
216,INTRODUCTORY.,completely opposed to the dark pessimism to which much of the
217,INTRODUCTORY.,unbelieving speculation of the present day so painfully tends. The dark
218,INTRODUCTORY.,things of human life and destiny are by no means ignored; rather are
219,INTRODUCTORY.,they dwelt on with a painful and sometimes frightful realism; but even
220,INTRODUCTORY.,"amid deepest darkness the light above is never quite extinguished, and"
221,INTRODUCTORY.,some little “Pippa passes” singing:
222,INTRODUCTORY.,
223,INTRODUCTORY.,“The year’s at the spring
224,INTRODUCTORY.,And day’s at the morn;
225,INTRODUCTORY.,Morning’s at seven;
226,INTRODUCTORY.,The hill-side’s dew-pearled;
227,INTRODUCTORY.,The lark’s on the wing;
228,INTRODUCTORY.,The snail’s on the thorn:
229,INTRODUCTORY.,God’s in his heaven—
230,INTRODUCTORY.,All’s right with the world.”
231,INTRODUCTORY.,
232,INTRODUCTORY.,There has been much discussion as to Browning’s personal attitude to
233,INTRODUCTORY.,"Christianity. The profoundly Christian tone of his writings is, of"
234,INTRODUCTORY.,"course, universally acknowledged; but attempts are sometimes made to"
235,INTRODUCTORY.,evade the force of those numerous passages in which he speaks of the
236,INTRODUCTORY.,"Incarnation, and Death, and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus, in a way"
237,INTRODUCTORY.,which seems to imply his hearty acceptance of the substance of what is
238,INTRODUCTORY.,known as evangelical truth. Much has been made in this connection of the
239,INTRODUCTORY.,"way in which, in one of his prefaces, he characterises his work as"
240,INTRODUCTORY.,"“poetry always dramatic in principle, and so many utterances of so many"
241,INTRODUCTORY.,"imaginary persons, not mine;” and it has been asserted that it is as"
242,INTRODUCTORY.,unwarrantable to consider him to be speaking his own sentiments in a
243,INTRODUCTORY.,"poem like “Christmas Eve,” as in one like “Johannes Agricola,” or"
244,INTRODUCTORY.,“Bishop Blougram’s Apology.” The obvious answer is that this profound
245,INTRODUCTORY.,sympathy with the Christ of God and His salvation is not found in some
246,INTRODUCTORY.,"solitary production, but appears and reappears, often when least"
247,INTRODUCTORY.,"expected, all through his works. In that remarkable little poem,"
248,INTRODUCTORY.,"entitled “House,” in which more strongly than anywhere else he claims"
249,INTRODUCTORY.,"personal privacy, while he declines to be regarded as having furnished"
250,INTRODUCTORY.,"his publishers with tickets to view his own soul’s dwelling, he admits"
251,INTRODUCTORY.,that “whoso desires to penetrate deeper” may do so “by the spirit
252,INTRODUCTORY.,"sense;” and accordingly some of his admirers, who dissent from him most"
253,INTRODUCTORY.,"strongly on this point, are the most ready to acknowledge that his"
254,INTRODUCTORY.,"Christian faith is no stage suit, but the very garment of his soul. As"
255,INTRODUCTORY.,illustration of this we may refer to the admirable essay by the late
256,INTRODUCTORY.,"James Thomson, published in Part II. of the Browning Society’s Papers,"
257,INTRODUCTORY.,"in which, after expressing his amazement that a great mind like"
258,INTRODUCTORY.,"Browning’s could be Christian, he asserts the, to him, remarkable but"
259,INTRODUCTORY.,quite undeniable fact in these words: “The devout and hopeful Christian
260,INTRODUCTORY.,"faith, explicitly or implicitly affirmed in such poems as _Saul_,"
261,INTRODUCTORY.,"_Kharshish_, _Cleon_, _Caliban upon Setebos_, _A Death in the Desert_,"
262,INTRODUCTORY.,"_Instans Tyrannus_, _Rabbi Ben Ezra_, _Prospice_, the _Epilogue_, and"
263,INTRODUCTORY.,"throughout that stupendous monumental work, _The Ring and the Book_,"
264,INTRODUCTORY.,must surely be as clear as noonday to even the most purblind vision.”
265,INTRODUCTORY.,
266,INTRODUCTORY.,"That a great Christian poet, in an age when so many of the intellectual"
267,INTRODUCTORY.,"magnates of the time are hostile or simply silent, should remain unknown"
268,INTRODUCTORY.,"or little known to any large proportion of Christian readers, is"
269,INTRODUCTORY.,certainly very much to be regretted. Surely the admiration which is
270,INTRODUCTORY.,freely and generously accorded to his work by many who are constrained
271,INTRODUCTORY.,"to it in spite of his faith in a Christ whom they reject, is a rebuke to"
272,INTRODUCTORY.,"the indifference of those who, sharing his faith, do not give themselves"
273,INTRODUCTORY.,the trouble to inquire what he has to say about it. There are not so
274,INTRODUCTORY.,many avowed and outspoken Christians in the highest walks of literature
275,INTRODUCTORY.,that we can afford to pay only slight attention to the utterances of one
276,INTRODUCTORY.,who has the ear of the deepest thinkers in every school of thought all
277,INTRODUCTORY.,the world over.
278,INTRODUCTORY.,

280,INTRODUCTORY.,
281,INTRODUCTORY.,The immediate object of this selection is to supply an introduction to
282,INTRODUCTORY.,the study of Browning for the benefit of the readers of the Chautauqua
283,INTRODUCTORY.,"Literary and Scientific Circle; but it is hoped that many others,"
284,INTRODUCTORY.,"inspired with similar aims, and who have not had such advantages that"
285,INTRODUCTORY.,they can dispense with all assistance in the study of a difficult
286,INTRODUCTORY.,"author, may find help from this little book. It is, of course, better to"
287,INTRODUCTORY.,read for one’s self than to follow the guidance of another; and yet it
288,INTRODUCTORY.,may be necessary to open a path far enough to lead within sight of the
289,INTRODUCTORY.,treasures in store. This is all that has been attempted here—only the
290,INTRODUCTORY.,"indication of a few veins near the surface of a rich mine, which the"
291,INTRODUCTORY.,reader is strongly recommended to explore for himself.
292,INTRODUCTORY.,
293,INTRODUCTORY.,The selection has been arranged on the principle of beginning with that
294,INTRODUCTORY.,"which is simple, and proceeding gradually to the more complex, with some"
295,INTRODUCTORY.,"regard also to variety and progress in subjects, and at the same time to"
296,INTRODUCTORY.,appropriateness for the use of those younger readers for whom this
297,INTRODUCTORY.,selection mainly is intended.
298,INTRODUCTORY.,
299,INTRODUCTORY.,The notes are meant to serve only as a guide to beginners; and as guides
300,INTRODUCTORY.,"are proverbially an annoyance when their services are imposed unsought,"
301,INTRODUCTORY.,"these are disposed at the end of each poem, and without reference marks"
302,INTRODUCTORY.,"to mar the pages, so that the selection may be read, if desired, without"
303,INTRODUCTORY.,any interference from the notes.
304,INTRODUCTORY.,
305,INTRODUCTORY.,"Within the limits of a volume like this, only the shorter poems could"
306,INTRODUCTORY.,find a place. Most valuable extracts from the longer works might have
307,INTRODUCTORY.,been given; but this is always a questionable method of dealing with the
308,INTRODUCTORY.,"best writers, with those especially whose thought is strictly"
309,INTRODUCTORY.,"consecutive, while the effect of particular passages depends to a large"
310,INTRODUCTORY.,extent on their setting and their relation to the work as a whole. The
311,INTRODUCTORY.,only[A] exception to this is the treatment of “Christmas Eve and Easter
312,INTRODUCTORY.,"Day,” with extracts from which this volume closes. That remarkable work"
313,INTRODUCTORY.,occupies a middle position between the shorter and the longer poems of
314,INTRODUCTORY.,"our author; and, though too long for insertion entire, is yet so"
315,INTRODUCTORY.,"important, that it seemed very desirable to give some idea of it. In"
316,INTRODUCTORY.,"furnishing a series of extracts from this work, an attempt has been made"
317,INTRODUCTORY.,to reduce the disadvantage above referred to by supplying along with
318,INTRODUCTORY.,"them a slight sketch or “argument,” so as to give some idea, to those"
319,INTRODUCTORY.,"unacquainted with it, of the course of thought throughout."
320,INTRODUCTORY.,
321,INTRODUCTORY.,It is right to say that Mr. Browning has given his kind permission for
322,INTRODUCTORY.,"the publication in the United States of this Selection, and also of the"
323,INTRODUCTORY.,"Notes, for which, however, as for the selection itself, he is in no wise"
324,INTRODUCTORY.,responsible.

330,INTRODUCTORY.,It has been found necessary also to give only the latter part of the

332,INTRODUCTORY.,the poem is continued without interruption to its close.

549,X.,
550,X.,“There is no sort of historical foundation about ‘Good News From Ghent.’
551,X.,"I wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the African coast, after I"

555,X.,"This poem, therefore, widely known and appreciated as one of the most"

573,ECHETLOS.,
574,ECHETLOS.,"No man but did his manliest, kept rank and fought away"
575,ECHETLOS.,"In his tribe and file: up, back, out, down—was the spear-arm play:"
576,ECHETLOS.,"Like a wind-whipt branchy wood, all spear-arms a-swing that day!"
577,ECHETLOS.,
578,ECHETLOS.,"But one man kept no rank, and his sole arm plied no spear,"
579,ECHETLOS.,"As a flashing came and went, and a form i’ the van, the rear,"
580,ECHETLOS.,"Brightened the battle up, for he blazed now there, now here."
581,ECHETLOS.,
582,ECHETLOS.,"Nor helmed nor shielded, he! but, a goat-skin all his wear,"
583,ECHETLOS.,"Like a tiller of the soil, with a clown’s limbs broad and bare,"
584,ECHETLOS.,Went he ploughing on and on: he pushed with a ploughman’s share.
585,ECHETLOS.,
586,ECHETLOS.,"Did the weak mid-line give way, as tunnies on whom the shark"
587,ECHETLOS.,"Precipitates his bulk? Did the right-wing halt when, stark"
588,ECHETLOS.,"On his heap of slain, lay stretched Kallimachos Polemarch?"
589,ECHETLOS.,
590,ECHETLOS.,"Did the steady phalanx falter? To the rescue, at the need,"
591,ECHETLOS.,"The clown was ploughing Persia, clearing Greek earth of weed,"
592,ECHETLOS.,As he routed through the Sakian and rooted up the Mede.
593,ECHETLOS.,
594,ECHETLOS.,"But the deed done, battle won,—nowhere to be descried"
595,ECHETLOS.,"On the meadow, by the stream, at the marsh,—look far and wide"
596,ECHETLOS.,"From the foot of the mountain, no, to the last blood-plashed sea-side,—"
597,ECHETLOS.,
598,ECHETLOS.,"Not anywhere on view blazed the large limbs thonged and brown,"
599,ECHETLOS.,Shearing and clearing still with the share before which—down
600,ECHETLOS.,"To the dust went Persia’s pomp, as he ploughed for Greece, that clown!"
601,ECHETLOS.,
602,ECHETLOS.,How spake the Oracle? “Care for no name at all!
603,ECHETLOS.,Say but just this: We praise one helpful whom we call
604,ECHETLOS.,The Holder of the Ploughshare. The great deed ne’er grows small.”
605,ECHETLOS.,
606,ECHETLOS.,"Not the great name! Sing—woe for the great name Míltiadés,"
607,ECHETLOS.,And its end at Paros isle! Woe for Themistokles—
608,ECHETLOS.,Satrap in Sardis court! Name not the clown like these!
609,ECHETLOS.,
610,ECHETLOS.,"The name, Echetlos, is derived from ἐχέτλη, a plough handle. It is not"
611,ECHETLOS.,"strictly a proper name, but an appellative, meaning “the Holder of the"
612,ECHETLOS.,"Ploughshare.” The story is found in Pausanias, author of the “Itinerary"
613,ECHETLOS.,"of Greece” (1, 15, 32). Nothing further is necessary in order to"
614,ECHETLOS.,understand this little poem and appreciate its rugged strength than
615,ECHETLOS.,"familiarity with the battle of Marathon, and some knowledge of Miltiades"
616,ECHETLOS.,"and Themistocles, the one known as the hero of Marathon, and the other"
617,ECHETLOS.,as the hero of Salamis. The lesson of the poem (“The great _deed_ ne’er
618,ECHETLOS.,"grows small, not the great _name_!”) is taught in a way not likely to be"
619,ECHETLOS.,"forgotten. One is reminded of another, who wished to be nameless, heard"
620,ECHETLOS.,only as “the voice of one crying in the wilderness!”
621,ECHETLOS.,
622,ECHETLOS.,The ellipsis in thought between the eighth and ninth stanzas is so
623,ECHETLOS.,easily supplied that it is noticed here only as a simple illustration of
624,ECHETLOS.,"what is sometimes the occasion of difficulty (see Introduction, p. iii)."
625,ECHETLOS.,It would only have lengthened the poem and weakened it to have inserted
626,ECHETLOS.,"a stanza telling in so many words that when the hero could not be found,"
627,ECHETLOS.,a message was sent to the Oracle to enquire who it could be.
628,ECHETLOS.,
629,ECHETLOS.,As a companion to “Echetlos” may be read the stirring poem of “Hervé
630,ECHETLOS.,Riel.”

866,XXII.,contemptible manner of the man’s life is strikingly brought out by the
867,XXII.,"various suppositions (stanzas 5, 6, 7) so different from the poor"
868,XXII.,"reality (8-9). All he cared for was business, which made him “chuckle”"
869,XXII.,"on the one hand or “chafe” on the other, according as times were good or"
870,XXII.,bad (10). Even in his business it was not the real excellence of his
871,XXII.,"wares he cared for, only their saleability (11). A merchant prince is a"
872,XXII.,very different person (13-19). The last three stanzas give the lesson in

874,XXII.,solemnity.

1016,THE BOY AND THE ANGEL.,"to live on earth and bend over a common trade, if only thus he can serve"
1017,THE BOY AND THE ANGEL.,Him best (13-19); and again the content of the “new pope Theocrite” to
1018,THE BOY AND THE ANGEL.,go back to his “cell and poor employ” and fill out the measure of his
1019,THE BOY AND THE ANGEL.,"day of service, growing old at home, while Gabriel as contentedly takes"

1120,II.,"I struck him, he grovelled of course—"
1121,II.,"For, what was his force?"
1122,II.,I pinned him to earth with my weight
1123,II.,And persistence of hate;

1135,III.,All in vain! Gold and jewels I threw
1136,III.,Still he couched there perdue;
1137,III.,"I tempted his blood and his flesh,"
1138,III.,"Hid in roses my mesh,"

1140,III.,Still he kept to his filth.

1144,IV.,"Had he kith now or kin, were access"

1149,IV.,"’Mid my million or two,"

1183,VI.,Ran my fires for his sake;
1184,VI.,"Over-head, did my thunder combine"
1185,VI.,With my under-ground mine:

1187,VI.,To enjoy the event.

1191,VII.,"When sudden ... how think ye, the end?"
1192,VII.,Did I say “without friend?”
1193,VII.,Say rather from marge to blue marge
1194,VII.,The whole sky grew his targe
1195,VII.,"With the sun’s self for visible boss,"
1196,VII.,While an Arm ran across
1197,VII.,Which the earth heaved beneath like a breast
1198,VII.,Where the wretch was safe prest!
1199,VII.,"Do you see! Just my vengeance complete,"
1200,VII.,"The man sprang to his feet,"
1201,VII.,"Stood erect, caught at God’s skirts, and prayed!"
1202,VII.,"—So, _I_ was afraid!"
1203,VII.,
1204,VII.,"“Instans Tyrannus,” the _present_ tyrant, the tyrant for the time only,"
1205,VII.,whose apparently illimitable power to hurt shrivels into nothing in
1206,VII.,"presence of the King of kings, whose dominion is everlasting."
1207,VII.,
1208,VII.,"The poor victim of this tyrant’s oppression is a true child of God, but"
1209,VII.,the nobility of his inner life is of course concealed from the proud
1210,VII.,"wretch who despises him, and who, it must be remembered, is the speaker"
1211,VII.,"throughout. We must be careful, therefore, to estimate at their proper"
1212,VII.,worth the epithets he applies and the motives he attributes to the
1213,VII.,"object of his hate. _He_ can, of course, think of no other reason why"
1214,VII.,"his victim “would not moan, would not curse,” than that, if he did, “his"
1215,VII.,"lot might be worse.” And again, when temptation failed to shake his"
1216,VII.,"steadfast patience, the tyrant is quite consistent with himself, as one"
1217,VII.,"of those who call evil good, and good evil, in speaking of him as still"
1218,VII.,keeping “to his filth.” The last stanza is magnificent. Has the power of
1219,VII.,prayer ever been set forth in nobler language?

1233,I.,"Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us,"
1234,I.,"Lost all the others, she lets us devote;"
1235,I.,"They, with the gold to give, doled him out silver,"
1236,I.,So much was theirs who so little allowed:
1237,I.,How all our copper had gone for his service!
1238,I.,"Rags—were they purple, his heart had been proud!"
1239,I.,"We that had loved him so, followed him, honoured him,"
1240,I.,"Lived in his mild and magnificent eye,"
1241,I.,"Learned his great language, caught his clear accents,"
1242,I.,Made him our pattern to live and to die!
1243,I.,"Shakespeare was of us, Milton was for us,"
1244,I.,"Burns, Shelley, were with us,—they watch from their graves!"

1253,II.,Still bidding crouch whom the rest bade aspire:
1254,II.,"Blot out his name, then, record one lost soul more,"
1255,II.,"One task more declined, one more footpath untrod,"
1256,II.,"One more devil’s-triumph and sorrow for angels,"
1257,II.,"One more wrong to man, one more insult to God!"
1258,II.,Life’s night begins: let him never come back to us!
1259,II.,"There would be doubt, hesitation and pain,"

1262,II.,"Best fight on well, for we taught him—strike gallantly,"
1263,II.,Menace our heart ere we master his own;
1264,II.,"Then let him receive the new knowledge and wait us,"
1265,II.,"Pardoned in heaven, the first by the throne!"
1266,II.,
1267,II.,"“The Lost Leader” is supposed to be the poet Wordsworth, who, on"
1268,II.,"accepting the laureateship, abandoned the party of distinguished"
1269,II.,literary men who had enthusiastically supported the principles of the
1270,II.,"French Revolution. It is necessary, of course, to enter into the lofty"
1271,II.,"enthusiasm of that party, and for the moment to identify ourselves with"
1272,II.,"it, in order to appreciate the wonderful power and pathos of this"
1273,II.,exquisite poem. (See Wordsworth’s “French Revolution as it appeared to
1274,II.,enthusiasts at its commencement.”)
1275,II.,
1276,II.,"The contrasts are very powerful between the one (paltry) gift he gained,"
1277,II.,"and all the others (love, loyalty, life, &c.) they were privileged to"
1278,II.,"_devote_ (far richer than mere possession); and again, between the"
1279,II.,"niggardliness of his new patrons with their dole of silver, contrasted"
1280,II.,"with the enthusiastic devotion of his own followers, who having nothing"
1281,II.,"but “copper,” would yet put it all at his service—having nothing but"
1282,II.,"“rags,” were yet so liberal with what they had, that had they been"
1283,II.,"purple, he would have been proud indeed, seeing that “a riband to stick"
1284,II.,in his coat” had proved so great an attraction.
1285,II.,
1286,II.,In the second stanza the fountains of the great deep of human feeling
1287,II.,are broken up. “Life’s night begins” suggests at once the strength of
1288,II.,"the previous attachment, and the hopelessness of the broken tie being"
1289,II.,"ever knit again on earth. The best thing is to be counted enemies now,"
1290,II.,and fight against each other as gallantly as they would have fought
1291,II.,together. At the same time there is absolute confidence in the ultimate
1292,II.,"triumph of the party of freedom—he may “menace our hearts,” but we shall"
1293,II.,"“master his”—and in the ultimate recovery of the lost leader himself,"
1294,II.,"whom he hopes to find “pardoned in heaven, the first by the throne.”"

1408,VII.,
1409,VII.,The supreme value of love is a constantly recurring thought in the poems
1410,VII.,of our author. We shall meet it in its higher ranges in selections to
1411,VII.,"come. Here we are still in the sphere of the mere earthly affection,"
1412,VII.,"with only the suggestion, in contrast with the transitoriness of earthly"
1413,VII.,"glory, of its indestructibility."
1414,VII.,
1415,VII.,"No explanation seems needed, excepting perhaps to call attention to"
1416,VII.,"this, that the “little turret” in stanza 4 is not a bartizan, but a"
1417,VII.,"staircase turret, or it could not “mark the basement, whence a tower in"

1419,VII.,
1420,VII.,"Observe, in each stanza, the striking contrast between the former and"

1423,VII.,
1424,VII.,There is not much of the descriptive in the poems of our author; he is

1474,I.,By no change of its large calm front of snow.
1475,I.,"And, underneath the Mount, a Flower I know,"
1476,I.,"He cannot have perceived, that changes ever"
1477,I.,"At his approach; and, in the lost endeavour"
1478,I.,"To live his life, has parted, one by one,"
1479,I.,"With all a flower’s true graces, for the grace"
1480,I.,"Of being but a foolish mimic sun,"
1481,I.,With ray-like florets round a disk-like face.
1482,I.,Men nobly call by many a name the Mount
1483,I.,As over many a land of theirs its large
1484,I.,Calm front of snow like a triumphal targe

1491,II.,"Oh, Angel of the East, one, one gold look"

1497,III.,"Dear Pilgrim, art thou for the East indeed?"
1498,III.,"Go!—saying ever as thou dost proceed,"
1499,III.,"That I, French Rudel, choose for my device"
1500,III.,A sunflower outspread like a sacrifice
1501,III.,Before its idol. See! These inexpert
1502,III.,And hurried fingers could not fail to hurt
1503,III.,The woven picture; ’tis a woman’s skill
1504,III.,"Indeed; but nothing baffled me, so, ill"
1505,III.,"Or well, the work is finished. Say, men feed"
1506,III.,"On songs I sing, and therefore bask the bees"
1507,III.,On my flower’s breast as on a platform broad:
1508,III.,"But, as the flower’s concern is not for these"
1509,III.,"But solely for the sun, so men applaud"
1510,III.,"In vain this Rudel, he not looking here"
1511,III.,"But to the East—the East! Go, say this, Pilgrim dear!"
1512,III.,
1513,III.,This poem was first published in “Bells and Pomegranates” under the head
1514,III.,"of “Queen Worship.” How exquisite the plea of the unnoticed Flower, with"
1515,III.,no pretence to vie with the Mountain in its claim upon the Sun’s
1516,III.,"attention, except this, that the great unchanging Mountain is “vainly"
1517,III.,"favoured,” while the Flower yields itself up in ceaseless and"
1518,III.,"self-forgetting devotion to an imitation, however feeble and foolish, of"
1519,III.,the great Sun Life.
1520,III.,
1521,III.,The second stanza is very rich. There is no mention in it of Sun or
1522,III.,Mountain or Flower; but as the Flower looks up to the Sun from its nook
1523,III.,"at the Mountain’s base, so Rudel yearns for “one gold look” from his"
1524,III.,"Sun, the “Angel of the East.”"
1525,III.,
1526,III.,The meaning of the third stanza will be apparent when it is remembered
1527,III.,that “French Rudel” was a troubadour of the 12th century—the days of the
1528,III.,"Crusades, and of the romance of chivalry. In those days the best way to"
1529,III.,communicate with the East would be through some pilgrim passing thither:
1530,III.,and nothing would be more natural than such a reference to the “device”
1531,III.,"which he had patiently, and in spite of difficulty, worked so as to wear"
1532,III.,"it as her “favour:” and once more, it is eminently natural to represent"
1533,III.,"the troubadour, not as sending a written message, but as finding a"
1534,III.,sympathetic pilgrim to burden his memory with it—charging him to keep it
1535,III.,fresh by repetition till it had been duly delivered.

1978,XIII.,"kingdom of God. These beauties may be unrecognised at first, so that the"
1979,XIII.,"poet is not known as a poet, except to such as the speaker here is"
1980,XIII.,"supposed to be (“I know you”). He recognises in him a star. How is it,"
1981,XIII.,"then, that his light is hidden? The hand of God, who looks down on him"
1982,XIII.,from far above (“God’s glow-worm”) as I look up to him from far below
1983,XIII.,"(“my star”), has closed around him to keep him and his light safe till"
1984,XIII.,the time shall come for discovery (Stanza 3) and for recognition (4).
1985,XIII.,"The drawing, or simile follows, of a Tyrian fisherman (5), who brings"
1986,XIII.,"from the great sea the common-looking little whelk, from which, by a"
1987,XIII.,"secret process, is obtained that wonderful dye which out-dazzles art,"
1988,XIII.,and almost equals Nature’s most exquisite tints (6-10). While the
1989,XIII.,"process is going on, the world stands aloof (11); but as soon as the"
1990,XIII.,"extract is “priced and saleable,” the commonest people (12) can"
1991,XIII.,recognise it and make it pay (13); while the man who fished it up
1992,XIII.,remains poor and unknown to fame.

2288,XII.,"Having given specimen poems dealing with the arts of poetry, painting,"

2290,XII.,"difficult to understand fully, has beauties which are apparent even to"
2291,XII.,those who do not enter into its deepest thought. Vogler is not known as
2292,XII.,"a composer of the first rank, having left no works behind him which"
2293,XII.,"entitle him to a place among the great masters; but, for this very"
2294,XII.,"reason, he is better suited for the poet’s purpose, which is to deal"
2295,XII.,"with music, not as represented by printed notes, but as existing for the"
2296,XII.,"moment in all its perfection, and at once melting away into silence and"
2297,XII.,"apparent nothingness. It is as extemporizer, not as author, he is"
2298,XII.,"chosen, and as Abbé (_Ger._ Abt) he appropriately thinks of those deep"
2299,XII.,spiritual truths on which the loftier hopes of the latter part of the
2300,XII.,poem are founded.
2301,XII.,
2302,XII.,"The musician “has been extemporizing,”—pouring out his whole soul"
2303,XII.,"through the keys of his organ, and from that state of ecstasy he"
2304,XII.,"suddenly awakes and cries out, “Would that the structure brave, the"
2305,XII.,"manifold music I build ... might tarry!” It has been no mere “volume,”"
2306,XII.,but a “palace” of sound. As Solomon (according to the well-known legend)
2307,XII.,"summoned all spirits from above and from below, and all creatures of the"
2308,XII.,"earth, to build him a palace at once, so by a touch, “calling the keys"
2309,XII.,"to their work,” he has summoned demons of the bass, angels of the"
2310,XII.,"treble, earth creatures of the middle tones, who, by eager and"
2311,XII.,"tumultuous and yet harmoniously united efforts, have caused “the"
2312,XII.,pinnacled glory” to “rush into sight” (stanzas 1-3).
2313,XII.,
2314,XII.,Into sight? There was far more in it than could be seen. As the soul of
2315,XII.,"the musician ascended from earth, heaven descended on him; its stars"
2316,XII.,"crowned his work; its moons, its suns were close beside him—“there was"
2317,XII.,"no more near nor far” (4). And the boundaries of time, as well as the"
2318,XII.,"limits of space, were gone. The _absolute_, the _perfect_ was reached;"
2319,XII.,and to this palace of perfection had flocked “presences plain in the
2320,XII.,"place,” from the far Future and from the mystic Past. “There was no more"
2321,XII.,"sea”—no more distance or separation—all one, together, perfect (5)."
2322,XII.,Reached how? Through music—the only one of the arts that leads into the
2323,XII.,"region of the absolute and perfect, its effects not springing from"
2324,XII.,"causes the operation of which can be traced, and the law of their"
2325,XII.,"production defined, but responding directly to the will, even as"
2326,XII.,creation responded to the _fiat_ of God. Out of such simple elements can
2327,XII.,"that be evoked, which should lead those who “consider” these things to"
2328,XII.,"“bow the head” (6, 7)."
2329,XII.,
2330,XII.,But was it only for a moment? Is it gone? Forever? (8).
2331,XII.,
2332,XII.,"I turn to God, and know it cannot be. Then follows that glorious"
2333,XII.,"passage, one of the finest in any language, every word of which should"
2334,XII.,"be studied, beginning—“There shall never be one lost good!” on to the"
2335,XII.,"end of stanza 11, which is the true climax of the poem."
2336,XII.,
2337,XII.,The last stanza may be compared to the closing one of “Saul.” It is the
2338,XII.,return from the empyrean to the plain of common life. Let some musical
2339,XII.,friend show how at the cadence of a very grand piece he would feel his
2340,XII.,"way down the chromatic scale, and then pause on that poignant discord,"
2341,XII.,"known as “the minor ninth,” effecting, as it were, a separation (“alien"
2342,XII.,"ground”) from the heights just descended, and giving thus the"
2343,XII.,opportunity of looking up once more before a resting-place is found in
2344,XII.,"“the common chord,”—“the C major of this life.”"
2345,XII.,
2346,XII.,This is a poem which should be read over and over till the music of it
2347,XII.,has fairly entered the soul.
2348,XII.,
2349,XII.,It has become common now to speak slightingly of those representations
2350,XII.,of heaven which make large use of music to give them body in our
2351,XII.,"thought, as if the idea intended to be conveyed were that the joy of"
2352,XII.,"heaven was to consist in an endless idle singing, a concert without a"
2353,XII.,finale; but this easy criticism is surely too disregardful of the
2354,XII.,"distinctive feature of music so strikingly set forth in this poem—viz.,"
2355,XII.,that it is the only one of the arts which while strongly appealing to
2356,XII.,"sense, yet in its essence belongs to the realm of the unseen, so that it"
2357,XII.,is in fact the only symbol within the range of man’s experience which
2358,XII.,"can even suggest the absolute, the perfect, the pure heavenly."
2359,XII.,
2360,XII.,"The following passage, from the “Memorials of Frances Ridley Havergal,”"
2361,XII.,"(p. 151) is so strikingly illustrative of “Abt Vogler,” that we cannot"
2362,XII.,forbear quoting it:—
2363,XII.,
2364,XII.,“In the train I had one of those curious musical visions which only very
2365,XII.,"rarely visit me. I hear strange and very beautiful chords, generally"
2366,XII.,"full, slow and grand, succeeding each other in most interesting"
2367,XII.,"sequences. I do not invent them, I could not; they pass before my mind,"
2368,XII.,and I only listen. Now and then my will seems aroused when I see ahead
2369,XII.,"how some fine resolution might follow, and I seem to _will_ that certain"
2370,XII.,"chords should come, and then they do come; but then my will seems"
2371,XII.,"suspended again, and they go on quite independently. It is so"
2372,XII.,"interesting, the chords seem to _fold over each other_, and die away"
2373,XII.,"down into music of infinite softness, and then they _un_fold and open"
2374,XII.,"out, as if great curtains were being withdrawn one after another,"
2375,XII.,"widening the view, till, with a gathering power and intensity and"
2376,XII.,"fulness, it seems as if the very skies were being opened out before one,"
2377,XII.,"and a sort of great blaze and glory of music, such as my outward ears"
2378,XII.,"never heard, gradually swells out in perfectly sublime splendour. This"
2379,XII.,time there was an added feature; I seemed to hear depths and heights of
2380,XII.,"sound beyond the scale which human ears can receive, keen, far-up"
2381,XII.,"octaves, like vividly twinkling _starlight_ of music, and mighty slow"
2382,XII.,"vibrations of gigantic strings going down into grand thunders of depths,"
2383,XII.,"octaves below anything otherwise appreciable as musical notes. Then, all"
2384,XII.,"at once, it seemed as if my soul had got a new sense, and I could _see_"
2385,XII.,this inner music as well as hear it; and then it was like gazing down
2386,XII.,"into marvellous _abysses of sound_, and up into dazzling regions of"
2387,XII.,"what, to the eye, would have been light and colour, but to this new"
2388,XII.,sense was _sound_.”

2660,XIX.,"“Men and Women,” a collection of fifty poems, first published in 1855,"
2661,XIX.,is probably the best known of our author’s numerous volumes. Some of the
2662,XIX.,very finest of his work is in it. To this collection “One Word More” is
2663,XIX.,"an appendix, in the form of a dedication of the fifty poems to his wife,"
2664,XIX.,"Elizabeth Barrett Browning. As we learn from stanza 13, this work"
2665,XIX.,"differs from all others in having been dashed off, the first time of"
2666,XIX.,writing being also the last time; and yet (such is the inspiration of
2667,XIX.,love) it stands with the very highest of his works. It needs careful
2668,XIX.,"reading, but presents no such difficulties as “Abt Vogler.”"
2669,XIX.,
2670,XIX.,"Rafael, painter for the world, becomes for once a poet for his dearest."
2671,XIX.,"If only these wonderful sonnets could be found, how we should prize"
2672,XIX.,them; but the volume is hopelessly lost (stanzas 2-4).
2673,XIX.,
2674,XIX.,"Dante, poet for the world, prepares for once to paint an angel for _his_"
2675,XIX.,"dearest. But, alas! he is hindered by the breaking in of some “people of"
2676,XIX.,"importance” of the city, the sort of people who served as character"
2677,XIX.,models for “the folk of his Inferno” (5-7).
2678,XIX.,
2679,XIX.,There would evidently be less of art and more of nature in such an
2680,XIX.,"outpouring of soul; and, therefore, the true artist would long to do it"
2681,XIX.,"“once, and only once, and for one only.” “The man’s joy” would be found"
2682,XIX.,"in the mere utterance of his soul to his dearest, without any thought of"
2683,XIX.,"art, which, to the true artist, lifts so high an ideal that his"
2684,XIX.,shortcoming is always a “sorrow” (8).
2685,XIX.,
2686,XIX.,"So is it with the prophet, the exercise of whose high calling can never"
2687,XIX.,"be dissociated from its burdens and cares (9). If he dared, which he may"
2688,XIX.,"not (10), how gladly for the one that he loved would he “put off the"
2689,XIX.,"prophet” and provide water, not by the forth putting of power, but"
2690,XIX.,"simply as the man, through the self-denial of love (11)."
2691,XIX.,
2692,XIX.,"Browning himself has only the one art, so cannot leave his poetry to"
2693,XIX.,"paint, or carve, or “make music” (12); but as the nearest equivalent"
2694,XIX.,"possible to him will write “once, and only once, and for one only,” a"
2695,XIX.,"purely extemporaneous production (13), which shall not, like his other"
2696,XIX.,"works, be dramatic in principle, but spoken in his own “true person”"
2697,XIX.,(14).
2698,XIX.,
2699,XIX.,"Then follows the wonderful moon illustration, so marvellously wrought"
2700,XIX.,"out, based upon the familiar astronomical fact that, through all her"
2701,XIX.,phases and movements she always presents exactly the same face to the
2702,XIX.,"earth (15), the other remaining entirely concealed (“unseen of herdsman,"
2703,XIX.,"huntsman, steersman,” &c.), and therefore available as a new revelation"
2704,XIX.,(who knows of what grandeur?) for the loved and specially-favoured
2705,XIX.,mortal (16).
2706,XIX.,
2707,XIX.,The application of the illustration in stanzas 17 and 18 is exquisitely
2708,XIX.,"beautiful, as is the gem-like quatrain with which the poem closes."

2727,SAUL.,"Young David is telling over to himself (see “my voice to my heart,” in"
2728,SAUL.,"stanza 14) the story of his mission to Saul, when, as an inspired"
2729,SAUL.,"poet-musician, he charmed the evil spirit away from him. Stanza 16,"
2730,SAUL.,"consisting of one line, is the hinge of the entire poem; for David has"
2731,SAUL.,"just reached the point where, after several unsuccessful, or very"
2732,SAUL.,"partially successful, attempts—first, by playing one and another and"
2733,SAUL.,"another tune, which might awaken some chord in the apathetic spirit of"
2734,SAUL.,"the king, and then by singing, accompanied by the harp, first, of the"
2735,SAUL.,"joy of life, then of the splendid results of a royal life like Saul’s in"
2736,SAUL.,"the great future of the world—he at last, the truth coming upon him,"
2737,SAUL.,strikes the high key where full relief is found. As he approaches this
2738,SAUL.,"crisis in the tale, he cannot go on without an earnest invocation for"

2746,XIV.,"In that act where my soul was thy servant, thy word was my word,—"
2747,XIV.,"Still help me, who then at the summit of human endeavour"
2748,XIV.,"And scaling the highest, man’s thought could, gazed hopeless as ever"
2749,XIV.,"On the new stretch of heaven above me—till, mighty to save,"
2750,XIV.,Just one lift of thy hand cleared that distance—God’s throne from man’s
2751,XIV.,grave!
2752,XIV.,Let me tell out my tale to its ending—my voice to my heart
2753,XIV.,"Which scarce dares believe in what marvels last night I took part,"
2754,XIV.,"As this morning I gather the fragments, alone with my sheep!"
2755,XIV.,"And fear lest the terrible glory evanish like sleep,"
2756,XIV.,"For I wake in the grey dewy covert, while Hebron upheaves"

2762,XV.,"I say then,—my song"

2765,XV.,His old motions and habitudes kingly. The right hand replumed
2766,XV.,"His black locks to their wonted composure, adjusted the swathes"
2767,XV.,"Of his turban, and see—the huge sweat that his countenance bathes,"
2768,XV.,"He wipes off with the robe; and he girds now his loins as of yore,"
2769,XV.,"And feels slow for the armlets of price, with the clasp set before."
2770,XV.,"He is Saul, ye remember in glory,—ere error had bent"
2771,XV.,"The broad brow from the daily communion; and still, though much spent"
2772,XV.,"Be the life and the bearing that front you, the same, God did choose,"
2773,XV.,"To receive what a man may waste, desecrate, never quite lose."
2774,XV.,"So sank he along by the tent-prop, still, stayed by the pile"
2775,XV.,"Of his armour and war-cloak and garments, he leaned there awhile,"
2776,XV.,"And sat out my singing,—one arm round the tent-prop, to raise"
2777,XV.,"His bent head, and the other hung slack—till I touched on the praise"

2780,XV.,"That he sat, as I say, with my head just above his vast knees"
2781,XV.,"Which were thrust out on each side around me, like oak roots which"
2782,XV.,please
2783,XV.,To encircle a lamb when it slumbers. I looked up to know
2784,XV.,"If the best I could do had brought solace: he spoke not, but slow"
2785,XV.,"Lifted up the hand slack at his side, till he laid it with care"
2786,XV.,"Soft and grave, but in mild settled will, on my brow: thro’ my hair"
2787,XV.,"The large fingers were pushed, and he bent back my head, with kind"
2788,XV.,power—
2789,XV.,"All my face back, intent to peruse it, as men do a flower."
2790,XV.,Thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mine—
2791,XV.,"And oh, all my heart how it loved him! but where was the sign?"
2792,XV.,"I yearned—“Could I help thee, my father, inventing a bliss,"
2793,XV.,"“I would add, to that life of the past, both the future and this;"
2794,XV.,"“I would give thee new life altogether, as good, ages hence,"
2795,XV.,"“As this moment,—had love but the warrant, love’s heart to dispense!”"
2796,XV.,
2797,XVI.,XVI.
2798,XVI.,
2799,XVI.,Then the truth came upon me. No harp more—no song more! outbroke—
2800,XVI.,
2801,XVII.,XVII.
2802,XVII.,
2803,XVII.,“I have gone the whole round of creation: I saw and I spoke;
2804,XVII.,"“I, a work of God’s hand for that purpose, received in my brain"
2805,XVII.,“And pronounced on the rest of his handwork—returned him again
2806,XVII.,"“His creation’s approval or censure: I spoke as I saw,"
2807,XVII.,"“Reported, as man may of God’s work—all’s love, yet all’s law."
2808,XVII.,“Now I lay down the judgeship he lent me. Each faculty tasked
2809,XVII.,"“To perceive him has gained an abyss, where a dew-drop was asked."
2810,XVII.,“Have I knowledge? confounded it shrivels at Wisdom laid bare.
2811,XVII.,"“Have I forethought? how purblind, how blank, to the Infinite Care!"
2812,XVII.,"“Do I task any faculty highest, to image success?"
2813,XVII.,"“I but open my eyes,—and perfection, no more and no less,"
2814,XVII.,"“In the kind I imagined, full-fronts me, and God is seen God"
2815,XVII.,"“In the star, in the stone, in the flesh, in the soul and the clod."
2816,XVII.,"“And thus looking within and around me, I ever renew"
2817,XVII.,“(With that stoop of the soul which in bending upraises it too)
2818,XVII.,"“The submission of man’s nothing-perfect to God’s all-complete,"
2819,XVII.,"“As by each new obeisance in spirit, I climb to his feet."
2820,XVII.,"“Yet with all this abounding experience, this deity known,"
2821,XVII.,"“I shall dare to discover some province, some gift of my own."
2822,XVII.,"“There’s a faculty pleasant to exercise, hard to hood-wink,"
2823,XVII.,"“I am fain to keep still in abeyance, (I laugh as I think)"
2824,XVII.,"“Lest, insisting to claim and parade in it, wot ye, I worst"
2825,XVII.,"“E’en the Giver in one gift.—Behold, I could love if I durst!"
2826,XVII.,“But I sink the pretension as fearing a man may o’ertake
2827,XVII.,“God’s own speed in the one way of love: I abstain for love’s sake.
2828,XVII.,"—“What, my soul? see thus far and no farther? when doors great and"
2829,XVII.,"small,"
2830,XVII.,"“Nine-and-ninety flew ope at our touch, should the hundredth appal?"
2831,XVII.,"“In the least things have faith, yet distrust in the greatest of all?"
2832,XVII.,"“Do I find love so full in my nature, God’s ultimate gift,"
2833,XVII.,"“That I doubt his own love can compete with it? Here, the parts shift?"
2834,XVII.,"“Here, the creature surpass the Creator,—the end what began?"
2835,XVII.,"“Would I fain in my impotent yearning do all for this man,"
2836,XVII.,"“And dare doubt he alone shall not help him, who yet alone can?"
2837,XVII.,"“Would it ever have entered my mind, the bare will, much less power,"
2838,XVII.,"“To bestow on this Saul what I sang of, the marvellous dower"
2839,XVII.,"“Of the life he was gifted and filled with? to make such a soul,"
2840,XVII.,"“Such a body, and then such an earth for insphering the whole?"
2841,XVII.,"“And doth it not enter my mind (as my warm tears attest),"
2842,XVII.,"“These good things being given, to go on, and give one more, the best?"
2843,XVII.,"“Ay, to save and redeem and restore him, maintain at the height"
2844,XVII.,"“This perfection,—succeed, with life’s dayspring, death’s minute of"
2845,XVII.,night:
2846,XVII.,"“Interpose at the difficult minute, snatch Saul, the mistake,"
2847,XVII.,"“Saul, the failure, the ruin he seems now,—and bid him awake"
2848,XVII.,"“From the dream, the probation, the prelude, to find himself set"
2849,XVII.,"“Clear and safe in new light and new life,—a new harmony yet"
2850,XVII.,"“To be run and continued, and ended—who knows?—or endure!"
2851,XVII.,"“The man taught enough by life’s dream, of the rest to make sure;"
2852,XVII.,"“By the pain-throb, triumphantly winning intensified bliss,"
2853,XVII.,"“And the next world’s reward and repose, by the struggles in this."
2854,XVII.,
2855,XVIII.,XVIII.
2856,XVIII.,
2857,XVIII.,"“I believe it! ’Tis thou, God, that givest, ’tis I who receive:"
2858,XVIII.,"“In the first is the last, in thy will is my powder to believe."
2859,XVIII.,"“All’s one gift: thou canst grant it, moreover, as prompt to my prayer,"

2866,XVIII.,"“See the King—I would help him, but cannot, the wishes fall through."
2867,XVIII.,"“Could I wrestle to raise him from sorrow, grow poor to enrich,"
2868,XVIII.,"“To fill up his life, starve my own out, I would—knowing which,"
2869,XVIII.,"“I know that my service is perfect. Oh, speak through me now!"
2870,XVIII.,“Would I suffer for him that I love? So wouldst thou—so wilt thou!

2881,XVIII.,"“A Face like my face that receives thee; a Man like to me,"
2882,XVIII.,"“Thou shalt love and be loved by, for ever: a Hand like this hand"

2884,XVIII.,
2885,XIX.,XIX.
2886,XIX.,
2887,XIX.,I know not too well how I found my way home in the night.
2888,XIX.,"There were witnesses, cohorts about me, to left and to right,"
2889,XIX.,"Angels, powers, the unuttered, unseen, the alive, the aware:"
2890,XIX.,"I repressed, I got through them as hardly, as strugglingly there,"
2891,XIX.,As a runner beset by the populace famished for news—
2892,XIX.,"Life or death. The whole earth was awakened, hell loosed with her"
2893,XIX.,crews;
2894,XIX.,"And the stars of night beat with emotion, and tingled and shot"
2895,XIX.,"Out in fire the strong pain of pent knowledge: but I fainted not,"
2896,XIX.,"For the Hand still impelled me at once and supported, suppressed"
2897,XIX.,"All the tumult, and quenched it with quiet, and holy behest,"
2898,XIX.,"Till the rapture was shut in itself, and the earth sank to rest."
2899,XIX.,"Anon at the dawn, all that trouble had withered from earth—"
2900,XIX.,"Not so much, but I saw it die out in the day’s tender birth;"
2901,XIX.,In the gathered intensity brought to the grey of the hills;
2902,XIX.,In the shuddering forests’ held breath; in the sudden wind-thrills;
2903,XIX.,"In the startled wild beasts that bore off, each with eye sidling still,"
2904,XIX.,Though averted with wonder and dread; in the birds stiff and chill
2905,XIX.,"That rose heavily as I approached them, made stupid with awe:"
2906,XIX.,E’en the serpent that slid away silent—he felt the new law.
2907,XIX.,The same stared in the white humid faces upturned by the flowers;
2908,XIX.,The same worked in the heart of the cedar and moved the vine-bowers:
2909,XIX.,"And the little brooks witnessing murmured, persistent and low,"
2910,XIX.,"With their obstinate, all but hushed voices—“E’en so, it is so!”"
2911,XIX.,
2912,XIX.,_Stanza 14._—Observe the meeting of the human and divine in the
2913,XIX.,"poet-prophet’s inspiration. As poet, his powers were in their fullest"
2914,XIX.,"exercise, and still there was an unfathomable heaven of the unknown"
2915,XIX.,"above him, till “one lift of Thy hand cleared that distance.”"
2916,XIX.,
2917,XIX.,The close of this stanza sets before us the scene of the writing of this
2918,XIX.,reminiscence.

2921,XIX.,
2922,XIX.,_Stanza 15._—The soothing influence of the singing begins to appear. Be
2923,XIX.,"sure to keep in mind the picture, so wonderfully illustrated, of the"
2924,XIX.,"attitude of the two; and mark the words of David, “All my heart how it"
2925,XIX.,"loved him,” connecting them carefully with the next stanza (16), “_Then_"
2926,XIX.,the truth came upon me.” It is only to the earnestly-loving heart that
2927,XIX.,"such a revelation of God could be given. “God is Love, and he that"
2928,XIX.,"loveth not knoweth not God.” Observe, also, in this short stanza the"
2929,XIX.,"effect of the intense earnestness of his soul, leading him to lay aside"
2930,XIX.,"his harp and cease his singing, and simply break out in impassioned"
2931,XIX.,speech.

2936,XIX.,"faculties except one, and that “the greatest of all,” viz., Love? (Note,"
2937,XIX.,"in passing, the exquisite beauty of the lines: “With that stoop of the"
2938,XIX.,"soul which in bending upraises it too,” and “As by each new obeisance in"
2939,XIX.,"spirit, I climb to his feet.” The passage immediately following this"
2940,XIX.,"line is of course ironical at his own expense, which is indicated by the"
2941,XIX.,parenthetical “I laugh as I think”; as if to say “how utterly foolish
2942,XIX.,"the thought that such a wide province, such a grand gift, as Love,"
2943,XIX.,"should be mine quite apart from God, the great Ruler and Giver of all!”)"

2946,XIX.,
2947,XIX.,"_Stanza 18._—Impossible! God is the giver: all that I have—Love, as well"
2948,XIX.,"as everything else—is from him; I can wish, but cannot will the thing I"
2949,XIX.,"would; but God can, therefore God will; his love cannot be frustrated as"
2950,XIX.,"mine is; it must even for such as “Saul, the failure, the ruin he seems"
2951,XIX.,"now,” find Salvation; being infinite it must have its will, and find a"
2952,XIX.,"way, however hard it be (see the striking line “it is by no breath,”"
2953,XIX.,&c.); and _there it is_! See THE CHRIST stand!
2954,XIX.,
2955,XIX.,Remember carefully the position as explained in the 15th stanza as you
2956,XIX.,"read the magnificent climax, beginning—"
2957,XIX.,
2958,XIX.,"“O Saul, it shall be"
2959,XIX.,A Face like my face that receives thee;”
2960,XIX.,
2961,XIX.,"observe also the effect of the spondee with which stanza 18 closes,"
2962,XIX.,instead of the usual anapæst; it gives wonderful dignity and strength to
2963,XIX.,the thought. The same effect is produced several times in the early part
2964,XIX.,"of the poem by the same means, but nowhere with such power as in this,"
2965,XIX.,the grand climax.

2967,XIX.,*       *       *       *       *
2968,XIX.,
2969,XIX.,What a contrast here to the petty mechanical notions of inspiration
2970,XIX.,which have so often degraded the loftiest subject of human thought; and
2971,XIX.,how marvellously is the presence and the power of the Unseen on such a
2972,XIX.,"soul as David’s imaged forth in the lines of the closing stanza, in"
2973,XIX.,words which seem almost to utter the unutterable.

3129,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Increased beyond the fleshly faculty—
3130,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Heaven opened to a soul while yet on earth,"
3131,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Earth forced on a soul’s use while seeing heaven:
3132,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The man is witless of the size, the sum,"
3133,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The value in proportion of all things,"
3134,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Or whether it be little or be much.
3135,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Discourse to him of prodigious armaments
3136,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Assembled to besiege his city now,"
3137,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,And of the passing of a mule with gourds—
3138,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"’Tis one! Then take it on the other side,"
3139,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Speak of some trifling fact,—he will gaze rapt"
3140,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"With stupor at its very littleness,"
3141,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,(Far as I see) as if in that indeed
3142,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"He caught prodigious import, whole results;"
3143,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,And so will turn to us the bystanders

3148,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Should his child sicken unto death,—why, look"
3149,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"For scarce abatement of his cheerfulness,"
3150,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Or pretermission of the daily craft!
3151,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"While a word, gesture, glance from that same child"
3152,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"At play or in the school or laid asleep,"
3153,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Will startle him to an agony of fear,"
3154,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Exasperation, just as like. Demand"
3155,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The reason why—“’tis but a word,” object—"
3156,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,“A gesture”—he regards thee as our lord
3157,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Who lived there in the pyramid alone,"
3158,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Looked at us (dost thou mind?) when, being young,"
3159,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,We both would unadvisedly recite
3160,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Some charm’s beginning, from that book of his,"
3161,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Able to bid the sun throb wide and burst
3162,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"All into stars, as suns grown old are wont."
3163,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Thou and the child have each a veil alike
3164,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Thrown o’er your heads, from under which ye both"
3165,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Stretch your blind hands and trifle with a match
3166,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Over a mine of Greek fire, did ye know!"
3167,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,He holds on firmly to some thread of life—
3168,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,(It is the life to lead perforcedly)
3169,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Which runs across some vast distracting orb
3170,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Of glory on either side that meagre thread,"
3171,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Which, conscious of, he must not enter yet—"
3172,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,The spiritual life around the earthly life:
3173,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The law of that is known to him as this,"
3174,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"His heart and brain move there, his feet stay here."
3175,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,So is the man perplext with impulses
3176,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Sudden to start off crosswise, not straight on,"
3177,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Proclaiming what is right and wrong across,"
3178,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"And not along, this black thread through the blaze—"
3179,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,“It should be” baulked by “here it cannot be.”
3180,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,And oft the man’s soul springs into his face
3181,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,As if he saw again and heard again
3182,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"His sage that bade him “Rise,” and he did rise."
3183,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Something, a word, a tick o’ the blood within"
3184,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Admonishes: then back he sinks at once
3185,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"To ashes, who was very fire before,"
3186,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,In sedulous recurrence to his trade
3187,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Whereby he earneth him the daily bread;
3188,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"And studiously the humbler for that pride,"
3189,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Professedly the faultier that he knows
3190,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"God’s secret, while he holds the thread of life."
3191,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Indeed the especial marking of the man
3192,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Is prone submission to the heavenly will—
3193,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Seeing it, what it is, and why it is."
3194,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"’Sayeth, he will wait patient to the last"
3195,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,For that same death which must restore his being
3196,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"To equilibrium, body loosening soul"
3197,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Divorced even now by premature full growth:
3198,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"He will live, nay, it pleaseth him to live"
3199,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"So long as God please, and just how God please."
3200,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,He even seeketh not to please God more
3201,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"(Which meaneth, otherwise) than as God please."
3202,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Hence, I perceive not he affects to preach"
3203,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The doctrine of his sect whate’er it be,"
3204,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Make proselytes as madmen thirst to do:
3205,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"How can he give his neighbour the real ground,"
3206,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,His own conviction? Ardent as he is—
3207,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Call his great truth a lie, why, still the old"
3208,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,“Be it as God please” reassureth him.
3209,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,I probed the sore as thy disciple should:
3210,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"“How, beast,” said I, “this stolid carelessness"
3211,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"“Sufficeth thee, when Rome is on her march"
3212,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"“To stamp out like a little spark thy town,"
3213,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"“Thy tribe, thy crazy tale and thee at once?”"
3214,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,He merely looked with his large eyes on me.
3215,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The man is apathetic, you deduce?"
3216,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Contrariwise, he loves both old and young,"
3217,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Able and weak, affects the very brutes"
3218,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,And birds—how say I? flowers of the field—
3219,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,As a wise workman recognises tools
3220,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"In a master’s workshop, loving what they make."
3221,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Thus is the man as harmless as a lamb:
3222,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Only impatient, let him do his best,"
3223,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,At ignorance and carelessness and sin—
3224,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,An indignation which is promptly curbed:
3225,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,As when in certain travel I have feigned
3226,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,To be an ignoramus in our art
3227,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,According to some preconceived design
3228,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,And happed to hear the land’s practitioners
3229,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance,"
3230,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Prattle fantastically on disease,"
3231,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Its cause and cure—and I must hold my peace!
3232,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3233,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Thou wilt object—Why have I not ere this
3234,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Sought out the sage himself, the Nazarene"
3235,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Who wrought this cure, inquiring at the source,"
3236,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Conferring with the frankness that befits?
3237,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Alas! it grieveth me, the learned leech"
3238,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Perished in a tumult many years ago,"
3239,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Accused,—our learning’s fate,—of wizardry,"
3240,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Rebellion, to the setting up a rule"
3241,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,And creed prodigious as described to me.
3242,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"His death, which happened when the earthquake fell"
3243,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"(Prefiguring, as soon appeared, the loss"
3244,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,To occult learning in our lord the sage
3245,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Who lived there in the pyramid alone)
3246,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Was wrought by the mad people—that’s their wont!
3247,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"On vain recourse, as I conjecture it,"
3248,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"To his tried virtue, for miraculous help—"
3249,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,How could he stop the earthquake? That’s their way!
3250,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,The other imputations must be lies:
3251,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"But take one, though I loathe to give it thee,"
3252,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,In mere respect for any good man’s fame.
3253,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"(And after all, our patient Lazarus"
3254,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Is stark mad; should we count on what he says?
3255,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Perhaps not: though in writing to a leech
3256,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,’Tis well to keep back nothing of a case.)
3257,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"This man so cured regards the curer, then,"
3258,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"As—God forgive me! who but God himself,"
3259,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Creator and sustainer of the world,"
3260,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,That came and dwelt in flesh on it awhile.
3261,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"—’Sayeth that such an one was born and lived,"
3262,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Taught, healed the sick, broke bread at his own house,"
3263,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Then died, with Lazarus by, for aught I know,"
3264,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"And yet was ... what I said nor choose repeat,"
3265,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"And must have so avouched himself, in fact,"
3266,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,In hearing of this very Lazarus
3267,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Who saith—but why all this of what he saith?
3268,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Why write of trivial matters, things of price"
3269,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Calling at every moment for remark?
3270,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,I noticed on the margin of a pool
3271,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Blue-flowering borage, the Aleppo sort,"
3272,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Aboundeth, very nitrous. It is strange!"
3273,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3274,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Thy pardon for this long and tedious case,"
3275,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Which, now that I review it, needs must seem"
3276,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Unduly dwelt on, prolixly set forth!"
3277,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Nor I myself discern in what is writ
3278,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Good cause for the peculiar interest
3279,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,And awe indeed this man has touched me with.
3280,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Perhaps the journey’s end, the weariness"
3281,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Had wrought upon me first. I met him thus:
3282,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,I crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills
3283,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Like an old lion’s cheek teeth. Out there came
3284,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,A moon made like a face with certain spots
3285,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Multiform, manifold and menacing:"
3286,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Then a wind rose behind me. So we met
3287,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"In this old sleepy town at unawares,"
3288,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,The man and I. I send thee what is writ.
3289,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Regard it as a chance, a matter risked"
3290,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"To this ambiguous Syrian: he may lose,"
3291,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Or steal, or give it thee with equal good."
3292,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Jerusalem’s repose shall make amends
3293,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"For time this letter wastes, thy time and mine;"
3294,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Till when, once more thy pardon and farewell!"
3295,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3296,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?"
3297,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"So, the All-Great were the All-Loving too—"
3298,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"So, through the thunder comes a human voice"
3299,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Saying, “O heart I made, a heart beats here!"
3300,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"“Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!"
3301,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,“Thou hast no power nor may’st conceive of mine:
3302,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"“But love I gave thee, with myself to love,"
3303,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,“And thou must love me who have died for thee!”
3304,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,The madman saith He said so: it is strange.
3305,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3306,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,This most interesting and beautiful poem will afford a good illustration
3307,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,of one of the cases of difficulty referred to in the Introduction. The
3308,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,reader is placed in the position of one who has just found this Arabian
3309,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"epistle, and must decipher and interpret it without any extraneous aid."
3310,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3311,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"First comes, according to Eastern custom, the name (line 1), then the"
3312,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"address (7), with the greeting (15), and mention of articles sent with"
3313,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,the letter—all in true Eastern style—with such adjuncts as give a
3314,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,general idea of the school of physiology and medicine to which the
3315,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,writer belongs.
3316,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3317,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"The twenty-first letter had ended at Jericho, and here, accordingly, the"
3318,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"twenty-second begins. The date appears as we read on, marked by the"
3319,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,expedition of Vespasian and his son Titus against Jerusalem. When
3320,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Bethany is mentioned, our interest is awakened, and we wonder what is"
3321,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"coming; but to the writer Bethany has no such associations, as is"
3322,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,indicated by the light and jocular way in which he marks its distance
3323,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"from Jerusalem, and carelessly proceeds to record the observations it is"
3324,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,his main business to make wherever he goes.
3325,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3326,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Further on, however, we discover that there is something of importance"
3327,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"weighing on his mind, which makes him hesitate and debate as to the"
3328,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"trustworthiness of the messenger he intends to employ; while, at the"
3329,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"same time, he is evidently ashamed to tell his master what is troubling"
3330,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"him. This accounts for his abruptly ending his letter (determining, for"
3331,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"the moment, to say nothing about it); then, unable to refrain, beginning"
3332,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"again, yet still trying to conceal the depth of his feeling, and to"
3333,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,apologize for what appears in spite of himself.
3334,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3335,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,A long account of the case follows. By this time the reader has begun to
3336,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,have a pretty good idea who “the man” is that “had something in the look
3337,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"of him,” and knows that it is a veritable case of one raised from the"
3338,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"dead. But Karshish cannot, of course, except under strong compulsion, be"
3339,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"expected to take this view; and, accordingly, he begins by looking at it"
3340,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"in a strictly professional light—“’Tis but a case of mania,” &c. He"
3341,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,naturally supposes that his master will set it down as an ordinary
3342,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"instance of hallucination: “Such cases are diurnal, thou wilt cry.” Then"
3343,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"he mentions points which strike him as altogether peculiar, certain"
3344,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,features of the “after life” which are quite inconsistent with the idea
3345,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"of mania. Instead of being the worse for his mania, this man is"
3346,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,immeasurably the better. Could Karshish and his master but penetrate the
3347,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"secret, what physicians they would be! The scene when Lazarus is brought"
3348,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"in by the Elders of his tribe—who regard him as a madman, because he is"
3349,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,living a life so far above anything they can understand—is inimitable.
3350,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3351,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"In the illustration of the beggar suddenly become rich, Karshish lets"
3352,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,out at last that he suspects there must be some truth in the man’s
3353,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"story. His patient, he observes, now measures things with no earthly"
3354,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"measure, seeing often the small in the great and the great in the small;"
3355,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"looking at everything “with larger, other eyes than ours”; accepting"
3356,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"with perfect equanimity the very greatest _sorrow_, yet filled with"
3357,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"alarm at the least gesture or look which gives token of _sin_, because"
3358,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,to him it was like trifling with a match over a mine of Greek fire!
3359,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3360,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"In the next illustration, of the thread of life across an orb of glory,"
3361,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,the writer seems to get still fuller insight into the reality of the
3362,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"case—the little thread being, of course, the poor life in Bethany, and"
3363,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"the vast orb of glory, the great eternity of God, in which Lazarus was"
3364,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"consciously living. And here, again, we have the same lesson as in “The"
3365,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Boy and the Angel.” Though conscious of the glory of the great orb,"
3366,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Lazarus does not despise the little duties belonging to the thread of
3367,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,his earthly life. He sedulously follows his trade whereby he earns his
3368,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"daily bread; indeed, the special characteristic of the man is “prone"
3369,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,submission to the Heavenly will.” Mark the profound suggestiveness of
3370,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,the lines—
3371,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3372,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,“He even seeketh not to please God more
3373,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"(Which meaneth, otherwise) than as God please.”"
3374,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3375,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,He is so calm as to be provoking. At his inquisitor’s burst of
3376,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"indignation, he shows no sign of anger or impatience—“He merely looked"
3377,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,with his large eyes on me.” And yet no apathy about him; a man full of
3378,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,loving interest in all things. (Compare Coleridge’s well-known lines:
3379,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"“He prayeth best who loveth best,” &c.)"
3380,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3381,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,The paragraph which follows introduces us to a region familiar and
3382,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"sacred to us, but foreign and inexplicable to our physician, who refers"
3383,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"to it from his own point of view, stigmatizing the claim of “the"
3384,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Nazarene who wrought this cure” as not only false, but monstrous; and"
3385,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,yet—and yet—and yet—he cannot get over it; it haunts him. But still he
3386,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"is ashamed to acknowledge it, and so turns abruptly from what he affects"
3387,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"to call “trivial matters” to “things of price,” like “blue-flowering"
3388,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,borage”!
3389,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3390,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Then he gives another elaborate apology, and tries to account for the"
3391,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,hold the phenomenon has taken of him by a reference to his state of body
3392,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"and surroundings when first he met this Lazarus; and, accordingly,"
3393,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"professing to care little whether the letter reaches or not, again he"
3394,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,closes.
3395,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3396,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Yet still he cannot rest. The great thought haunts him. “The very God!
3397,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"_think_, Abib.” Then follows that consummate passage with which this"
3398,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,magnificent poem closes.
3399,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,
3400,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,After this “Epistle” should by all means be read “A Death in the
3401,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,"Desert,” too long and too difficult to be inserted here. The surprise"
3402,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,awaiting the reader of the parchment “supposed of Pamphylax the
3403,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,Antiochene” will add to the interest of a poem so full of beauty and
3404,THE ARAB PHYSICIAN.,power.

3419,CHRISTMAS-EVE.,These titles then may well include the whole substance of Christianity.
3420,CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Christmas suggests the thought of heaven come down to earth; Easter, of"

3432,CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"indeed, but with little mind and less taste. It is not from choice that"

3479,I.,"And meet the party thus presided,"
3480,I.,"“Mount Zion” with Love-lane at the back of it,"
3481,I.,They front you as little disconcerted
3482,I.,"As, bound for the hills, her fate averted,"
3483,I.,"And her wicked people made to mind him,"
3484,I.,Lot might have marched with Gomorrah behind him.
3485,I.,
3486,I.,"In the same light and humorous, half irreverent style, he proceeds to a"
3487,I.,somewhat detailed description of the people and their uncouth
3488,I.,"worship—not altogether a caricature, but evidently wanting in that"
3489,I.,"sympathy with the good at the heart of it, the thought of which was"
3490,I.,"afterwards so strongly borne in upon his soul. So, he “very soon had"
3491,I.,"enough of it,” and gladly “flung out of the little chapel” “into the"
3492,I.,fresh night air again.”
3493,I.,
3494,IV.,IV.
3495,IV.,
3496,IV.,"There was a lull in the rain, a lull"
3497,IV.,"In the wind too; the moon was risen,"
3498,IV.,"And would have shone out pure and full,"
3499,IV.,"But for the ramparted cloud-prison,"
3500,IV.,"Block on block built up in the West,"
3501,IV.,"For what purpose the wind knows best,"
3502,IV.,Who changes his mind continually.
3503,IV.,And the empty other half of the sky
3504,IV.,Seemed in its silence as if it knew
3505,IV.,"What, any moment, might look through"
3506,IV.,A chance gap in that fortress massy:—
3507,IV.,Through its fissures you got hints
3508,IV.,"Of the flying moon, by the shifting tints,"
3509,IV.,"Now, a dull lion-colour, now, brassy"
3510,IV.,"Burning to yellow, and whitest yellow,"
3511,IV.,"Like furnace-smoke just ere the flames bellow,"
3512,IV.,All a-simmer with intense strain
3513,IV.,"To let her through,—then blank again,"
3514,IV.,At the hope of her appearance failing.
3515,IV.,"Just by the chapel, a break in the railing"
3516,IV.,Shows a narrow path directly across;
3517,IV.,"’Tis ever dry walking there, on the moss—"
3518,IV.,"Besides, you go gently all the way uphill"
3519,IV.,I stooped under and soon felt better;
3520,IV.,"My head grew lighter, my limbs more supple,"
3521,IV.,"As I walked on, glad to have slipt the fetter."
3522,IV.,"My mind was full of the scene I had left,"
3523,IV.,"That placid flock, that pastor vociferant,"
3524,IV.,—How this outside was pure and different!
3525,IV.,"The sermon, now—what a mingled weft"
3526,IV.,"Of good and ill! Were either less,"
3527,IV.,Its fellow had coloured the whole distinctly;
3528,IV.,"But alas for the excellent earnestness,"
3529,IV.,"And the truths, quite true if stated succinctly,"
3530,IV.,"But as surely false, in their quaint presentment,"
3531,IV.,However to pastor and flock’s contentment!
3532,IV.,"Say rather, such truths looked false to your eyes,"
3533,IV.,"With his provings and parallels twisted and twined,"
3534,IV.,"Till how could you know them, grown double their size"
3535,IV.,"In the natural fog of the good man’s mind,"
3536,IV.,"Like yonder spots of our roadside lamps,"
3537,IV.,Haloed about with the common’s damps?
3538,IV.,"Truth remains true, the fault’s in the prover;"
3539,IV.,"The zeal was good, and the aspiration;"
3540,IV.,"And yet, and yet, yet, fifty times over,"
3541,IV.,"Pharaoh received no demonstration,"
3542,IV.,"By his Baker’s dream of Baskets Three,"
3543,IV.,"Of the doctrine of the Trinity,—"
3544,IV.,"Although, as our preacher thus embellished it,"
3545,IV.,Apparently his hearers relished it
3546,IV.,With so unfeigned a gust—who knows if
3547,IV.,They did not prefer our friend to Joseph?
3548,IV.,
3549,IV.,*     *     *     *     *
3550,IV.,
3551,V.,V.
3552,V.,
3553,V.,But wherefore be harsh on a single case?
3554,V.,"After how many modes, this Christmas-Eve,"
3555,V.,Does the selfsame weary thing take place?
3556,V.,"The same endeavour to make you believe,"
3557,V.,"And with much the same effect, no more:"
3558,V.,"Each method abundantly convincing,"
3559,V.,"As I say, to those convinced before,"
3560,V.,But scarce to be swallowed without wincing
3561,V.,"By the not-as-yet-convinced. For me,"
3562,V.,I have my own church equally:
3563,V.,And in this church my faith sprang first!
3564,V.,"(I said, as I reached the rising ground,"
3565,V.,"And the wind began again, with a burst"
3566,V.,"Of rain in my face, and a glad rebound"
3567,V.,"From the heart beneath, as if, God speeding me,"
3568,V.,"I entered his church-door, nature leading me)"
3569,V.,"—In youth I looked to these very skies,"
3570,V.,"And probing their immensities,"
3571,V.,"I found God there, his visible power;"
3572,V.,"Yet felt in my heart, amid all its sense"
3573,V.,"Of the power, an equal evidence"
3574,V.,"That his love, there too, was the nobler dower."
3575,V.,
3576,V.,"Then follows a long and rather abstruse passage, leading up to the"
3577,V.,following lofty and inspiring conclusion:—
3578,V.,
3579,V.,"So, gazing up, in my youth, at love"
3580,V.,"As seen through power, ever above"
3581,V.,"All modes which make it manifest,"
3582,V.,My soul brought all to a single test—
3583,V.,"That he, the Eternal First and Last,"
3584,V.,"Who, in his power, had so surpassed"
3585,V.,"All man conceives of what is might,—"
3586,V.,"Whose wisdom, too, showed infinite,"
3587,V.,—Would prove as infinitely good;
3588,V.,"Would never, (my soul understood,)"
3589,V.,"With power to work all love desires,"
3590,V.,Bestow e’en less than man requires;
3591,V.,"That he who endlessly was teaching,"
3592,V.,"Above my spirit’s utmost reaching,"
3593,V.,"What love can do in the leaf or stone,"
3594,V.,"(So that to master this alone,"
3595,V.,"This done in the stone or leaf for me,"
3596,V.,I must go on learning endlessly)
3597,V.,"Would never need that I, in turn,"
3598,V.,"Should point him out defect unheeded,"
3599,V.,And show that God had yet to learn
3600,V.,"What the meanest human creature needed,"
3601,V.,"—Not life, to wit, for a few short years,"
3602,V.,"Tracking his way through doubts and fears,"
3603,V.,While the stupid earth on which I stay
3604,V.,"Suffers no change, but passive adds"
3605,V.,"Its myriad years to myriads,"
3606,V.,"Though I, he gave it to, decay,"
3607,V.,"Seeing death come and choose about me,"
3608,V.,And my dearest ones depart without me.
3609,V.,"No: love which, on earth, amid all the shows of it,"
3610,V.,"Has ever been seen the sole good of life in it,"
3611,V.,"The love, ever growing there, spite of the strife in it,"
3612,V.,"Shall arise, made perfect, from death’s repose of it."
3613,V.,"And I shall behold thee, face to face,"
3614,V.,"O God, and in thy light retrace"
3615,V.,"How in all I loved here, still wast thou!"
3616,V.,"Whom pressing to, then, as I fain would now,"
3617,V.,I shall find as able to satiate
3618,V.,"The love, thy gift, as my spirit’s wonder"
3619,V.,"Thou art able to quicken and sublimate,"
3620,V.,"With this sky of thine, that I now walk under,"
3621,V.,"And glory in thee for, as I gaze"
3622,V.,"Thus, thus! Oh, let men keep their ways"
3623,V.,Of seeking thee in a narrow shrine—
3624,V.,Be this my way! And this is mine!
3625,V.,
3626,V.,"The lunar rainbow, so wonderfully described in the next stanza, is the"
3627,V.,occasion and point of departure of the poetic vision or ecstasy which
3628,V.,occupies the remainder of the poem—
3629,V.,
3630,VI.,VI.
3631,VI.,
3632,VI.,"For lo, what think you? suddenly"
3633,VI.,"The rain and the wind ceased, and the sky"
3634,VI.,Received at once the full fruition
3635,VI.,Of the moon’s consummate apparition.
3636,VI.,"The black cloud-barricade was riven,"
3637,VI.,"Ruined beneath her feet, and driven"
3638,VI.,"Deep in the West; while, bare and breathless,"
3639,VI.,North and South and East lay ready
3640,VI.,"For a glorious thing that, dauntless, deathless,"
3641,VI.,Sprang across them and stood steady.
3642,VI.,"’Twas a moon-rainbow, vast and perfect,"
3643,VI.,"From heaven to heaven extending, perfect"
3644,VI.,"As the mother-moon’s self, full in face."
3645,VI.,"It rose, distinctly at the base"
3646,VI.,"With its seven proper colours chorded,"
3647,VI.,"Which still, in the rising, were compressed,"
3648,VI.,"Until at last they coalesced,"
3649,VI.,And supreme the spectral creature lorded
3650,VI.,"In a triumph of whitest white,—"
3651,VI.,Above which intervened the night.
3652,VI.,"But above night too, like only the next,"
3653,VI.,"The second of a wondrous sequence,"
3654,VI.,"Reaching in rare and rarer frequence,"
3655,VI.,"Till the heaven of heavens were circumflexed,"
3656,VI.,"Another rainbow rose, a mightier,"
3657,VI.,"Fainter, flushier and flightier,—"
3658,VI.,Rapture dying along its verge.
3659,VI.,"Oh, whose foot shall I see emerge,"
3660,VI.,"Whose, from the straining topmost dark,"
3661,VI.,On to the keystone of that arc?
3662,VI.,
3663,VI.,He did see One emerging from the glory—
3664,VI.,
3665,VIII.,VIII.
3666,VIII.,
3667,VIII.,All at once I looked up with terror.
3668,VIII.,"He was there,"
3669,VIII.,"He himself with his human air,"
3670,VIII.,"On the narrow pathway, just before."
3671,VIII.,"I saw the back of him, no more—"
3672,VIII.,"He had left the chapel, then, as I."
3673,VIII.,I forgot all about the sky.
3674,VIII.,No face: only the sight
3675,VIII.,"Of a sweepy garment, vast and white,"
3676,VIII.,With a hem that I could recognise.
3677,VIII.,"I felt terror, no surprise;"
3678,VIII.,"My mind filled with the cataract,"
3679,VIII.,At one bound of the mighty fact.
3680,VIII.,"“I remember, he did say"
3681,VIII.,"“Doubtless, that, to this world’s end,"
3682,VIII.,"“Where two or three should meet and pray,"
3683,VIII.,"“He would be in the midst, their friend;"
3684,VIII.,“Certainly he was there with them!”
3685,VIII.,And my pulses leaped for joy
3686,VIII.,"Of the golden thought without alloy,"
3687,VIII.,That I saw his very vesture’s hem.
3688,VIII.,"Then rushed the blood black, cold and clear,"
3689,VIII.,With a fresh enhancing shiver of fear;
3690,VIII.,"And I hastened, cried out while I pressed"
3691,VIII.,"To the salvation of the vest,"
3692,VIII.,"“But not so, Lord! It cannot be"
3693,VIII.,"“That thou, indeed, art leaving me—"
3694,VIII.,"“Me, that have despised thy friends!”"
3695,VIII.,
3696,VIII.,The confession of his sin in despising _His_ friends in the little
3697,VIII.,chapel is speedily followed by a gracious token of forgiveness:—
3698,VIII.,
3699,IX.,IX.
3700,IX.,
3701,IX.,*     *     *     *     *
3702,IX.,
3703,IX.,The whole face turned upon me full.
3704,IX.,"And I spread myself beneath it,"
3705,IX.,"As when the bleacher spreads, to seethe it"
3706,IX.,"In the cleansing sun, his wool,—"
3707,IX.,Steeps in the flood of noontide whiteness
3708,IX.,"Some defiled, discoloured web—"
3709,IX.,"So lay I, saturate with brightness."
3710,IX.,
3711,IX.,His sin thus purged (how exquisitely wrought out the lovely simile of
3712,IX.,"the sun-cleansed wool!), he is “caught up in the whirl and drift of the"
3713,IX.,"vesture’s amplitude,” and thus clinging to the garment’s hem, is carried"
3714,IX.,across land and sea—to a scene so complete a contrast to the one he has
3715,IX.,"just left that he is confused, and some time elapses before he discovers"
3716,IX.,that he is in front of St. Peter’s at Rome:—
3717,IX.,
3718,X.,X.
3719,X.,
3720,X.,And so we crossed the world and stopped.
3721,X.,"For where am I, in city or plain,"
3722,X.,Since I am ’ware of the world again?
3723,X.,And what is this that rises propped
3724,X.,With pillars of prodigious girth?
3725,X.,"Is it really on the earth,"
3726,X.,This miraculous Dome of God?
3727,X.,Has the angel’s measuring-rod
3728,X.,"Which numbered cubits, gem from gem,"
3729,X.,"’Twixt the gates of the New Jerusalem,"
3730,X.,"Meted it out,—and what he meted,"
3731,X.,Have the sons of men completed?
3732,X.,"—Binding, ever as he bade,"
3733,X.,Columns in the colonnade
3734,X.,With arms wide open to embrace
3735,X.,The entry of the human race
3736,X.,"To the breast of ... what is it, yon building,"
3737,X.,"Ablaze in front, all paint and gilding,"
3738,X.,"With marble for brick, and stones of price"
3739,X.,For garniture of the edifice?
3740,X.,Now I see; it is no dream;
3741,X.,It stands there and it does not seem:
3742,X.,"For ever, in pictures, thus it looks,"
3743,X.,And thus I have read of it in books
3744,X.,"Often in England, leagues away,"
3745,X.,"And wondered how these fountains play,"
3746,X.,Growing up eternally
3747,X.,"Each to a musical water-tree,"
3748,X.,"Whose blossoms drop, a glittering boon,"
3749,X.,"Before my eyes, in the light of the moon,"
3750,X.,To the granite layers underneath.
3751,X.,
3752,X.,There follows a description of the worship in the great cathedral—not
3753,X.,"now, as before, unsympathetic and merely critical, but giving evidence"
3754,X.,of the liveliest appreciation of the feelings of the intelligent and
3755,X.,"devout ritualist, as in the following passage:—"
3756,X.,
3757,X.,"Earth breaks up, time drops away,"
3758,X.,"In flows heaven, with its new day"
3759,X.,"Of endless life, when he who trod,"
3760,X.,"Very man and very God,"
3761,X.,"This earth in weakness, shame and pain,"
3762,X.,Dying the death whose signs remain
3763,X.,"Up yonder on the accursed tree,—"
3764,X.,"Shall come again, no more to be"
3765,X.,"Of captivity the thrall,"
3766,X.,"But the one God, All in all,"
3767,X.,"King of kings, Lord of lords,"
3768,X.,"As his servant John received the words,"
3769,X.,"“I died, and live for evermore!”"
3770,X.,
3771,X.,Still he cannot enter into it. He is left outside the door. Distracted
3772,X.,"with conflicting emotions, his reason repelled by the superstition, his"
3773,X.,spirit attracted by the lofty devotion which he discovers at the heart
3774,X.,of the too gorgeous ritual—he cannot make up his mind whether he should
3775,X.,"join them for the one reason, or shun them for the other—"
3776,X.,
3777,XI.,XI.
3778,XI.,
3779,XI.,*     *     *     *     *
3780,XI.,
3781,XI.,Though Rome’s gross yoke
3782,XI.,"Drops off, no more to be endured,"
3783,XI.,Her teaching is not so obscured
3784,XI.,"By errors and perversities,"
3785,XI.,That no truth shines athwart the lies:
3786,XI.,"And he, whose eye detects a spark"
3787,XI.,"Even where, to man’s, the whole seems dark,"
3788,XI.,May well see flame where each beholder
3789,XI.,Acknowledges the embers smoulder.
3790,XI.,"But I, a mere man, fear to quit"
3791,XI.,The clue God gave me as most fit
3792,XI.,"To guide my footsteps through life’s maze,"
3793,XI.,Because himself discerns all ways
3794,XI.,"Open to reach him: I, a man"
3795,XI.,Able to mark where faith began
3796,XI.,"To swerve aside, till from its summit"
3797,XI.,"Judgment drops her damning plummet,"
3798,XI.,Pronouncing such a fatal space
3799,XI.,Departed from the founder’s base:
3800,XI.,"He will not bid me enter too,"
3801,XI.,"But rather sit, as now I do,"
3802,XI.,Awaiting his return outside.
3803,XI.,—’Twas thus my reason straight replied
3804,XI.,"And joyously I turned, and pressed"
3805,XI.,"The garment’s skirt upon my breast,"
3806,XI.,"Until, afresh its light suffusing me,"
3807,XI.,My heart cried “What has been abusing me
3808,XI.,"That I should wait here lonely and coldly,"
3809,XI.,"Instead of rising, entering boldly,"
3810,XI.,"Baring truth’s face, and letting drift"
3811,XI.,Her veils of lies as they choose to shift?
3812,XI.,Do these men praise him? I will raise
3813,XI.,My voice up to their point of praise!
3814,XI.,I see the error; but above
3815,XI.,"The scope of error, see the love.—"
3816,XI.,"Oh, love of those first Christian days!"
3817,XI.,"—Fanned so soon into a blaze,"
3818,XI.,"From the spark preserved by the trampled sect,"
3819,XI.,That the antique sovereign Intellect
3820,XI.,"Which then sat ruling in the world,"
3821,XI.,"Like a change in dreams, was hurled"
3822,XI.,From the throne he reigned upon:
3823,XI.,You looked up and he was gone.
3824,XI.,
3825,XI.,"The remainder of the stanza is taken up with a most eloquent, but"
3826,XI.,"somewhat difficult passage, illustrating the triumph of the new Love"
3827,XI.,over the old Culture. In the following stanza he makes up his mind that
3828,XI.,"he “will feast his love, then depart elsewhere, that his intellect may"
3829,XI.,"find its share”; so the next transition, by the same mode of rapture, is"
3830,XI.,to a German University. What he sees there provokes again his latent
3831,XI.,humour:—
3832,XI.,
3833,XIV.,XIV.
3834,XIV.,
3835,XIV.,Alone! I am left alone once more—
3836,XIV.,(Save for the garment’s extreme fold
3837,XIV.,Abandoned still to bless my hold)
3838,XIV.,"Alone, beside the entrance-door"
3839,XIV.,"Of a sort of temple,—perhaps a college,"
3840,XIV.,—Like nothing I ever saw before
3841,XIV.,"At home in England, to my knowledge."
3842,XIV.,The tall old quaint irregular town!
3843,XIV.,"It may be ... though which, I can’t affirm ... any"
3844,XIV.,Of the famous middle-age towns of Germany;
3845,XIV.,"And this flight of stairs where I sit down,"
3846,XIV.,"Is it Halle, Weimar, Cassel, Frankfort,"
3847,XIV.,"Or Göttingen, I have to thank for ’t?"
3848,XIV.,"It may be Göttingen,—most likely."
3849,XIV.,Through the open door I catch obliquely
3850,XIV.,Glimpses of a lecture-hall;
3851,XIV.,"And not a bad assembly neither,"
3852,XIV.,Ranged decent and symmetrical
3853,XIV.,"On benches, waiting what’s to see there;"
3854,XIV.,"Which, holding still by the vesture’s hem,"
3855,XIV.,"I also resolve to see with them,"
3856,XIV.,Cautious this time how I suffer to slip
3857,XIV.,The chance of joining in fellowship
3858,XIV.,With any that call themselves his friends;
3859,XIV.,"As these folks do, I have a notion."
3860,XIV.,But hist—a buzzing and emotion!
3861,XIV.,"All settle themselves, the while ascends"
3862,XIV.,"By the creaking rail to the lecture-desk,"
3863,XIV.,"Step by step, deliberate"
3864,XIV.,"Because of his cranium’s over-freight,"
3865,XIV.,"Three parts sublime to one grotesque,"
3866,XIV.,"If I have proved an accurate guesser,"
3867,XIV.,"The hawk-nosed, high-cheek-boned Professor."
3868,XIV.,I felt at once as if there ran
3869,XIV.,A shoot of love from my heart to the man—
3870,XIV.,That sallow virgin-minded studious
3871,XIV.,"Martyr to mild enthusiasm,"
3872,XIV.,As he uttered a kind of cough-preludious
3873,XIV.,"That woke my sympathetic spasm,"
3874,XIV.,(Beside some spitting that made me sorry)
3875,XIV.,"And stood, surveying his auditory"
3876,XIV.,"With a wan pure look, well nigh celestial,—"
3877,XIV.,Those blue eyes had survived so much!
3878,XIV.,"While, under the foot they could not smutch,"
3879,XIV.,Lay all the fleshly and the bestial.
3880,XIV.,"Over he bowed, and arranged his notes,"
3881,XIV.,Till the auditory’s clearing of throats
3882,XIV.,"Was done with, died into a silence;"
3883,XIV.,"And, when each glance was upward sent,"
3884,XIV.,"Each bearded mouth composed intent,"
3885,XIV.,And a pin might be heard drop half a mile hence
3886,XIV.,"He pushed back higher his spectacles,"
3887,XIV.,"Let the eyes stream out like lamps from cells,"
3888,XIV.,And giving his head of hair—a hake
3889,XIV.,"Of undressed tow, for colour and quantity—"
3890,XIV.,"One rapid and impatient shake,"
3891,XIV.,(As our own young England adjusts a jaunty tie
3892,XIV.,"When about to impart, on mature digestion,"
3893,XIV.,Some thrilling view of the surplice-question)
3894,XIV.,"—The Professor’s grave voice, sweet though hoarse,"
3895,XIV.,Broke into his Christmas-Eve discourse.
3896,XIV.,
3897,XIV.,"The stanza which follows gives an account of the discourse, which is a"
3898,XIV.,"learned discussion of “this Myth of Christ,” “which, when reason had"
3899,XIV.,"strained and abated it of foreign matter, left, for residuum, a man!—a"
3900,XIV.,"right true man,” but nothing more. He has no difficulty in determining"
3901,XIV.,his duty here (“this time He would not bid me enter.”) The religious
3902,XIV.,"atmosphere in which Papist and Dissenter live may be far from pure, in"
3903,XIV.,"the one case for one reason, and in the other for the opposite; but"
3904,XIV.,either of the two is immeasurably better than the vacuum left when the
3905,XIV.,Critic has done his work of destruction. Then follows a long argument to
3906,XIV.,"show the unreasonableness of denying the divinity of Christ, only a part"
3907,XIV.,of which can be given here.

3913,XVI.,This time he would not bid me enter
3914,XVI.,The exhausted air-bell of the Critic.
3915,XVI.,Truth’s atmosphere may grow mephitic
3916,XVI.,"When Papist struggles with Dissenter,"
3917,XVI.,"Impregnating its pristine clarity,"
3918,XVI.,"—One, by his daily fare’s vulgarity,"
3919,XVI.,Its gust of broken meat and garlic;
3920,XVI.,"—One, by his soul’s too-much presuming"
3921,XVI.,To turn the frankincense’s fuming
3922,XVI.,And vapours of the candle starlike
3923,XVI.,Into the cloud her wings she buoys on.
3924,XVI.,"Each, that thus sets the pure air seething,"
3925,XVI.,May poison it for healthy breathing—
3926,XVI.,But the Critic leaves no air to poison;
3927,XVI.,Pumps out with ruthless ingenuity
3928,XVI.,"Atom by atom, and leaves you—vacuity."
3929,XVI.,"Thus much of Christ, does he reject?"
3930,XVI.,And what retain? His intellect?
3931,XVI.,What is it I must reverence duly?
3932,XVI.,"Poor intellect for worship, truly,"
3933,XVI.,Which tells me simply what was told
3934,XVI.,"(If mere morality, bereft"
3935,XVI.,"Of the God in Christ, be all that’s left)"
3936,XVI.,Elsewhere by voices manifold;
3937,XVI.,"With this advantage, that the stater"
3938,XVI.,Made nowise the important stumble
3939,XVI.,"Of adding, he, the sage and humble,"
3940,XVI.,Was also one with the Creator.
3941,XVI.,You urge Christ’s followers’ simplicity:
3942,XVI.,"But how does shifting blame, evade it?"
3943,XVI.,Have wisdom’s words no more felicity?
3944,XVI.,"The stumbling-block, his speech—who laid it?"
3945,XVI.,How comes it that for one found able
3946,XVI.,"To sift the truth of it from fable,"
3947,XVI.,Millions believe it to the letter?
3948,XVI.,"Christ’s goodness, then—does that fare better?"
3949,XVI.,"Strange goodness, which upon the score"
3950,XVI.,"Of being goodness, the mere due"
3951,XVI.,"Of man to fellow-man, much more"
3952,XVI.,"To God,—should take another view"
3953,XVI.,"Of its possessor’s privilege,"
3954,XVI.,And bid him rule his race! You pledge
3955,XVI.,"Your fealty to such rule? What, all—"
3956,XVI.,"From heavenly John and Attic Paul,"
3957,XVI.,And that brave weather-battered Peter
3958,XVI.,Whose stout faith only stood completer
3959,XVI.,"For buffets, sinning to be pardoned,"
3960,XVI.,"As, more his hands hauled nets, they hardened,—"
3961,XVI.,"All, down to you, the man of men,"
3962,XVI.,"Professing here at Göttingen,"
3963,XVI.,"Compose Christ’s flock! They, you and I,"
3964,XVI.,Are sheep of a good man!

3966,XVI.,Reasonings that grow out of the main discussion are continued throughout
3967,XVI.,"stanzas 17-20, till once more he is caught up and carried back to his"
3968,XVI.,original starting point. The remainder of the poem can now be given
3969,XVI.,"without interruption, and will be readily understood. (The exquisite"
3970,XVI.,development of the simile of the cup and the water will be specially
3971,XVI.,"noted, as also the charitable wish so strikingly expressed on behalf of"
3972,XVI.,"the poor Professor, that before the end comes he may know Christ as “the"
3973,XVI.,God of salvation.”)

3977,XXI.,And I caught
3978,XXI.,"At the flying robe, and unrepelled"
3979,XXI.,Was lapped again in its folds full-fraught
3980,XXI.,"With warmth and wonder and delight,"
3981,XXI.,God’s mercy being infinite.
3982,XXI.,"For scarce had the words escaped my tongue,"
3983,XXI.,"When, at a passionate bound, I sprung"
3984,XXI.,"Out of the wandering world of rain,"
3985,XXI.,Into the little chapel again.
3986,XXI.,

3988,XXII.,
3989,XXII.,"How else was I found there, bolt upright."
3990,XXII.,"On my bench, as if I had never left it?"
3991,XXII.,—Never flung out on the common at night
3992,XXII.,"Nor met the storm and wedge-like cleft it,"
3993,XXII.,"Seen the raree-show of Peter’s successor,"
3994,XXII.,Or the laboratory of the Professor!
3995,XXII.,"For the Vision, that was true, I wist,"
3996,XXII.,True as that heaven and earth exist.
3997,XXII.,"There sat my friend, the yellow and tall,"
3998,XXII.,With his neck and its wen in the selfsame place;
3999,XXII.,Yet my nearest neighbour’s cheek showed gall.
4000,XXII.,She had slid away a contemptuous space:
4001,XXII.,"And the old fat woman, late so placable,"
4002,XXII.,"Eyed me with symptoms, hardly mistakable,"
4003,XXII.,Of her milk of kindness turning rancid.
4004,XXII.,"In short, a spectator might have fancied"
4005,XXII.,"That I had nodded, betrayed by slumber,"
4006,XXII.,"Yet kept my seat, a warning ghastly,"
4007,XXII.,"Through the heads of the sermon, nine in number,"
4008,XXII.,And woke up now at the tenth and lastly.
4009,XXII.,"But again, could such disgrace have happened?"
4010,XXII.,Each friend at my elbow had surely nudged it;
4011,XXII.,"And, as for the sermon, where did my nap end?"
4012,XXII.,"Unless I heard it, could I have judged it?"
4013,XXII.,"Could I report as I do at the close,"
4014,XXII.,"First, the preacher speaks through his nose:"
4015,XXII.,"Second, his gesture is too emphatic:"
4016,XXII.,"Thirdly, to waive what’s pedagogic,"
4017,XXII.,The subject-matter itself lacks logic:
4018,XXII.,"Fourthly, the English is ungrammatic."
4019,XXII.,"Great news! the preacher is found no Pascal,"
4020,XXII.,"Whom, if I pleased, I might to the task call"
4021,XXII.,Of making square to a finite eye
4022,XXII.,"The circle of infinity,"
4023,XXII.,And find so all-but-just-succeeding!
4024,XXII.,Great news! the sermon proves no reading
4025,XXII.,"Where bee-like in the flowers I may bury me,"
4026,XXII.,Like Taylor’s the immortal Jeremy!
4027,XXII.,"And now that I know the very worst of him,"
4028,XXII.,What was it I thought to obtain at first of him?
4029,XXII.,"Ha! Is God mocked, as he asks?"
4030,XXII.,"Shall I take on me to change his tasks,"
4031,XXII.,"And dare, despatched to a river-head"
4032,XXII.,"For a simple draught of the element,"
4033,XXII.,"Neglect the thing for which he sent,"
4034,XXII.,And return with another thing instead?—
4035,XXII.,"Saying, “Because the water found"
4036,XXII.,"“Welling up from underground,"
4037,XXII.,"“Is mingled with the taints of earth,"
4038,XXII.,"“While thou, I know, dost laugh at dearth,"
4039,XXII.,"“And couldst, at wink or word, convulse"
4040,XXII.,"“The world with the leap of a river-pulse,—"
4041,XXII.,"“Therefore, I turned from the oozings muddy,"
4042,XXII.,"“And bring thee a chalice I found, instead:"
4043,XXII.,“See the brave veins in the breccia ruddy!
4044,XXII.,“One would suppose that the marble bled.
4045,XXII.,“What matters the water? A hope I have nursed
4046,XXII.,“The waterless cup will quench my thirst.”
4047,XXII.,—Better have knelt at the poorest stream
4048,XXII.,That trickles in pain from the straitest rift!
4049,XXII.,"For the less or the more is all God’s gift,"
4050,XXII.,Who blocks up or breaks wide the granite-seam.
4051,XXII.,"And here, is there water or not, to drink?"
4052,XXII.,"I then, in ignorance and weakness,"
4053,XXII.,"Taking God’s help, have attained to think"
4054,XXII.,My heart does best to receive in meekness
4055,XXII.,"That mode of worship, as most to his mind,"
4056,XXII.,"Where, earthly aids being cast behind,"
4057,XXII.,His All in All appears serene
4058,XXII.,"With the thinnest human veil between,"
4059,XXII.,"Letting the mystic lamps, the seven,"
4060,XXII.,"The many motions of his spirit,"
4061,XXII.,"Pass, as they list, to earth from heaven."
4062,XXII.,"For the preacher’s merit or demerit,"
4063,XXII.,It were to be wished the flaws were fewer
4064,XXII.,"In the earthern vessel, holding treasure,"
4065,XXII.,Which lies as safe in a golden ewer;
4066,XXII.,"But the main thing is, does it hold good measure?"
4067,XXII.,Heaven soon sets right all other matters!—
4068,XXII.,"Ask, else, these ruins of humanity,"
4069,XXII.,"This flesh worn out to rags and tatters,"
4070,XXII.,"This soul at struggle with insanity,"
4071,XXII.,"Who thence take comfort, can I doubt?"
4072,XXII.,"Which an empire gained, were a loss without."
4073,XXII.,May it be mine! And let us hope
4074,XXII.,"That no worse blessing befall the Pope,"
4075,XXII.,"Turn’d sick at last of to-day’s buffoonery,"
4076,XXII.,"Of posturings and petticoatings,"
4077,XXII.,Beside his Bourbon bully’s gloatings
4078,XXII.,In the bloody orgies of drunk poltroonery!
4079,XXII.,Nor may the Professor forego its peace
4080,XXII.,"At Göttingen presently, when, in the dusk"
4081,XXII.,"Of his life, if his cough, as I fear, should increase"
4082,XXII.,Prophesied of by that horrible husk—
4083,XXII.,When thicker and thicker the darkness fills
4084,XXII.,"The world through his misty spectacles,"
4085,XXII.,And he gropes for something more substantial
4086,XXII.,"Than a fable, myth or personification,—"
4087,XXII.,"May Christ do for him what no mere man shall,"
4088,XXII.,And stand confessed as the God of salvation!
4089,XXII.,"Meantime, in the still recurring fear"
4090,XXII.,"Lest myself, at unawares, be found,"
4091,XXII.,"While attacking the choice of my neighbours round,"
4092,XXII.,With none of my own made—I choose here!
4093,XXII.,The giving out of the hymn reclaims me;
4094,XXII.,"I have done: and if any blames me,"
4095,XXII.,Thinking that merely to touch in brevity
4096,XXII.,"The topics I dwell on, were unlawful,—"
4097,XXII.,"Or worse, that I trench, with undue levity,"
4098,XXII.,"On the bounds of the holy and the awful,—"
4099,XXII.,"I praise the heart, and pity the head of him,"
4100,XXII.,"And refer myself to THEE, instead of him,"
4101,XXII.,"Who head and heart alike discernest,"
4102,XXII.,"Looking below light speech we utter,"
4103,XXII.,When frothy spume and frequent sputter
4104,XXII.,Prove that the soul’s depths boil in earnest!
4105,XXII.,"May truth shine out, stand ever before us!"
4106,XXII.,I put up pencil and join chorus
4107,XXII.,"To Hepzibah tune, without further apology,"
4108,XXII.,The last five verses of the third section
4109,XXII.,"Of the seventeenth hymn of Whitfield’s Collection,"
4110,XXII.,To conclude with the doxology.

4113,EASTER-DAY.,EASTER-DAY.
4114,EASTER-DAY.,
4115,EASTER-DAY.,"As Christmas-Eve has suggested the subject of the Christian Faith,"
4116,EASTER-DAY.,Easter-Day gives occasion to a discussion concerning the Christian
4117,EASTER-DAY.,Life—the life of those who are “risen with Christ.” The poem is in
4118,EASTER-DAY.,"substance a conversation or discussion between two persons, one of whom"
4119,EASTER-DAY.,"(a thorough Christian) finds it very hard, while the other (who takes a"
4120,EASTER-DAY.,much lower and more common-place view of spiritual things) thinks it
4121,EASTER-DAY.,"quite easy, to be a Christian. It is not, however, in the form of a"
4122,EASTER-DAY.,"conversation. As usual in Browning’s work, one speaks, stating his own"
4123,EASTER-DAY.,"views and quoting the other’s, which are therefore distinguished from"
4124,EASTER-DAY.,"his own (except when he quotes, as he sometimes does, from himself) by"
4125,EASTER-DAY.,quotation marks. The argument is too abstruse to be followed out in all
4126,EASTER-DAY.,its ramifications; but enough of it can be given to render quite
4127,EASTER-DAY.,intelligible the extracts from it which we find it possible to give. The
4128,EASTER-DAY.,opening sentence will give the theme:—
4129,EASTER-DAY.,
4130,I.,I.
4131,I.,
4132,I.,How very hard it is to be
4133,I.,"A Christian! Hard for you and me,"
4134,I.,—Not the mere task of making real
4135,I.,"That duty up to its ideal,"
4136,I.,"Effecting thus, complete and whole,"
4137,I.,A purpose of the human soul—
4138,I.,For that is always hard to do;
4139,I.,"But hard, I mean, for me and you"
4140,I.,"To realize it, more or less,"
4141,I.,With even the moderate success
4142,I.,Which commonly repays our strife
4143,I.,To carry out the aims of life.
4144,I.,
4145,I.,"After some preliminary discussion about faith in its relation to life,"
4146,I.,the easy-going friend takes this position:—

4155,VI.,"“Beside you, with, if he thought fit,"
4156,VI.,"“Abundant means to compass it,"
4157,VI.,“Shall turn deliberate aside
4158,VI.,"“To try and live as, if you tried"
4159,VI.,"“You clearly might, yet most despise."
4160,VI.,"“One friend of mine wears out his eyes,"
4161,VI.,"“Slighting the stupid joys of sense,"
4162,VI.,"“In patient hope that, ten years hence,"
4163,VI.,"“‘Somewhat completer,’ he may say,"
4164,VI.,“‘My list of _coleoptera_!’
4165,VI.,“While just the other who most laughs
4166,VI.,"“At him, above all epitaphs"
4167,VI.,“Aspires to have his tomb describe
4168,VI.,“Himself as sole among the tribe
4169,VI.,"“Of snuffbox-fanciers, who possessed"
4170,VI.,“A Grignon with the Regent’s crest.
4171,VI.,"“So that, subduing, as you want,"
4172,VI.,“Whatever stands predominant
4173,VI.,“Among my earthly appetites
4174,VI.,"“For tastes and smells and sounds and sights,"
4175,VI.,"“I shall be doing that alone,"
4176,VI.,"“To gain a palm-branch and a throne,"
4177,VI.,“Which fifty people undertake
4178,VI.,"“To do, and gladly, for the sake"
4179,VI.,"“Of giving a Semitic guess,"
4180,VI.,“Or playing pawns at blindfold chess.”
4181,VI.,
4182,VI.,"The stanza which follows gives the speaker’s answer, ending with this"
4183,VI.,striking passage:—
4184,VI.,
4185,VI.,"“Renounce the world!”—Ah, were it done"
4186,VI.,By merely cutting one by one
4187,VI.,"Your limbs off, with your wise head last,"
4188,VI.,"How easy were it!—how soon past,"
4189,VI.,If once in the believing mood!
4190,VI.,
4191,VI.,"To which the other replies by reproaching him for ingratitude to God,"
4192,VI.,"who really asks us to give up nothing that is good, but only to observe"
4193,VI.,"such moderation in our pleasures that life is all the more enjoyable,"
4194,VI.,"while sorrow almost disappears, transfigured in the light of love. This"
4195,VI.,"answer has such a ring of the true metal in it, that the speaker begins"
4196,VI.,"his rejoinder with the question, “Do you say this, or I?” and then"
4197,VI.,proceeds (in a passage of wonderful power) to expose the superficiality
4198,VI.,of the view he is endeavouring to support.

4208,VIII.,"The all-stupendous tale,—that Birth,"
4209,VIII.,"That Life, that Death! And all, the earth"
4210,VIII.,"Shuddered at,—all, the heavens grew black"
4211,VIII.,"Rather than see; all, nature’s rack"
4212,VIII.,And throe at dissolution’s brink
4213,VIII.,"Attested,—all took place, you think,"
4214,VIII.,"Only to give our joys a zest,"
4215,VIII.,And prove our sorrows for the best?
4216,VIII.,"We differ, then! Were I, still pale"
4217,VIII.,"And heartstruck at the dreadful tale,"

4219,VIII.,"What horror followed for my share,"
4220,VIII.,"As implicated in the deed,"
4221,VIII.,"Apart from other sins,—concede"
4222,VIII.,That if he blacked out in a blot
4223,VIII.,"My brief life’s pleasantness, ’twere not"
4224,VIII.,So very disproportionate!

4228,VIII.,"How God might save, at that day’s price,"

4230,VIII.,Give formal licence and complete
4231,VIII.,To choose the fair and pick the sweet.
4232,VIII.,"But there be certain words, broad, plain,"
4233,VIII.,"Uttered again and yet again,"
4234,VIII.,Hard to mistake or overgloss—
4235,VIII.,"Announcing this world’s gain for loss,"
4236,VIII.,And bidding us reject the same:
4237,VIII.,The whole world lieth (they proclaim)
4238,VIII.,"In wickedness,—come out of it!"
4239,VIII.,"Turn a deaf ear, if you think fit,"
4240,VIII.,But I who thrill through every nerve
4241,VIII.,"At thought of what deaf ears deserve,—"
4242,VIII.,How do you counsel in the case?
4243,VIII.,
4244,VIII.,"The counsel was, to choose by all means the safe side, by giving up"
4245,VIII.,everything as literally as did the martyrs in the early days of
4246,VIII.,"persecution; at which a shudder of doubt comes over him, and he answers"

4258,X.,Back to ourselves with good effect—
4259,X.,“There were my beetles to collect!

4262,X.,"Poor idiots, (let us pluck up heart"

4264,X.,"Have chosen, though ’twere only hope,—"
4265,X.,Nor envy moles like you that grope
4266,X.,"Amid your veritable muck,"
4267,X.,"More than the grasshoppers would truck,"
4268,X.,"For yours, their passionate life away,"
4269,X.,That spends itself in leaps all day
4270,X.,"To reach the sun, you want the eyes"
4271,X.,"To see, as they the wings to rise"

4277,X.,"Our faith, but shake it—make us learn"
4278,X.,"What I began with, and, I wis,"
4279,X.,"End, having proved,—how hard it is"

4281,X.,
4282,X.,His friend now reproaches him with the thanklessness of the task he is
4283,X.,"undertaking, in trying to so little purpose to disturb the peace of a"
4284,X.,man who has no such high-flown views of duty; whereupon he relates to
4285,X.,him a wonderful experience he had on Easter-morn three years before:—
4286,X.,
4287,XIV.,XIV.
4288,XIV.,
4289,XIV.,I commence
4290,XIV.,"By trying to inform you, whence"
4291,XIV.,It comes that every Easter-night
4292,XIV.,"As now, I sit up, watch, till light,"
4293,XIV.,"Upon those chimney-stacks and roofs,"
4294,XIV.,"Give, through my window-pane, grey proofs"
4295,XIV.,That Easter-day is breaking slow.
4296,XIV.,"On such a night three years ago,"
4297,XIV.,It chanced that I had cause to cross
4298,XIV.,"The common, where the chapel was,"
4299,XIV.,"Our friend spoke of, the other day—"
4300,XIV.,"You’ve not forgotten, I dare say."
4301,XIV.,I fell to musing of the time
4302,XIV.,"So close, the blessed matin-prime"
4303,XIV.,"All hearts leap up at, in some guise—"
4304,XIV.,One could not well do otherwise.
4305,XIV.,Insensibly my thoughts were bent
4306,XIV.,Toward the main point; I overwent
4307,XIV.,Much the same ground of reasoning
4308,XIV.,As you and I just now. One thing
4309,XIV.,"Remained, however—one that tasked"
4310,XIV.,"My soul to answer; and I asked,"
4311,XIV.,"Fairly and frankly, what might be"
4312,XIV.,"That History, that Faith, to me"
4313,XIV.,—Me there—not me in some domain
4314,XIV.,"Built up and peopled by my brain,"
4315,XIV.,Weighing its merits as one weighs
4316,XIV.,"Mere theories for blame or praise,"
4317,XIV.,"—The kingcraft of the Lucumons,"
4318,XIV.,"Or Fourier’s scheme, its pros and cons,—"
4319,XIV.,"But my faith there, or none at all."
4320,XIV.,"“How were my case, now, did I fall"
4321,XIV.,"“Dead here, this minute—should I lie"
4322,XIV.,“Faithful or faithless?”
4323,XIV.,
4324,XIV.,To this solemn question a friendly answer seems to come from Common
4325,XIV.,"Sense, assuring him that all would be right; for, though his ship might"
4326,XIV.,"not sail very grandly into the eternal haven, it was enough if, in"
4327,XIV.,"whatever state of wreck, it arrived at all; which leads him to utter the"
4328,XIV.,deepest wish and expectation of his heart:—
4329,XIV.,
4330,XIV.,Would the ship reach home!
4331,XIV.,I wish indeed “God’s kingdom come—”
4332,XIV.,The day when I shall see appear
4333,XIV.,"His bidding, as my duty, clear"
4334,XIV.,"From doubt! And it shall dawn, that day,"
4335,XIV.,Some future season; Easter may
4336,XIV.,"Prove, not impossibly, the time—"
4337,XIV.,"Yes, that were striking—fates would chime"
4338,XIV.,"So aptly! Easter-morn, to bring"
4339,XIV.,The Judgment!—deeper in the spring
4340,XIV.,"Than now, however, when there’s snow"
4341,XIV.,Capping the hills; for earth must show
4342,XIV.,All signs of meaning to pursue
4343,XIV.,Her tasks as she was wont to do
4344,XIV.,"—The skylark, taken by surprise"
4345,XIV.,"As we ourselves, shall recognise"
4346,XIV.,Sudden the end. For suddenly
4347,XIV.,It comes; the dreadfulness must be
4348,XIV.,In that; all warrants the belief—
4349,XIV.,"“At night it cometh like a thief,”"
4350,XIV.,I fancy why the trumpet blows;
4351,XIV.,"—Plainly, to wake one. From repose"
4352,XIV.,"We shall start up, at last awake"
4353,XIV.,"From life, that insane dream we take"
4354,XIV.,For waking now.

4366,XV.,
4367,XV.,I found
4368,XV.,Suddenly all the midnight round
4369,XV.,One fire. The dome of heaven had stood
4370,XV.,As made up of a multitude
4371,XV.,"Of handbreadth cloudlets, one vast rack"
4372,XV.,"Of ripples infinite and black,"
4373,XV.,"From sky to sky. Sudden there went,"
4374,XV.,"Like horror and astonishment,"
4375,XV.,A fierce vindictive scribble of red
4376,XV.,"Quick flame across, as if one said"
4377,XV.,(The angry scribe of Judgment) “There—
4378,XV.,“Burn it!” And straight I was aware
4379,XV.,"That the whole ribwork round, minute"
4380,XV.,"Cloud touching cloud beyond compute,"
4381,XV.,"Was tinted, each with its own spot"
4382,XV.,"Of burning at the core, till clot"
4383,XV.,"Jammed against clot, and spilt its fire"
4384,XV.,"Over all heaven, which ’gan suspire"
4385,XV.,"As fanned to measure equable,—"
4386,XV.,Just so great conflagrations kill
4387,XV.,"Night overhead, and rise and sink,"
4388,XV.,Reflected. Now the fire would shrink
4389,XV.,And wither off the blasted face
4390,XV.,"Of heaven, and I distinct might trace"
4391,XV.,The sharp black ridgy outlines left
4392,XV.,"Unburned like network—then, each cleft"
4393,XV.,"The fire had been sucked back into,"
4394,XV.,"Regorged, and out it surging flew"
4395,XV.,"Furiously, and night writhed inflamed,"
4396,XV.,"Till, tolerating to be tamed"
4397,XV.,"No longer, certain rays world-wide"
4398,XV.,Shot downwardly. On every side
4399,XV.,"Caught past escape, the earth was lit;"
4400,XV.,"As if a dragon’s nostril split,"
4401,XV.,And all his famished ire o’erflowed;
4402,XV.,"Then as he winced at his lord’s goad,"
4403,XV.,Back he inhaled: whereat I found
4404,XV.,"The clouds into vast pillars bound,"
4405,XV.,"Based on the corners of the earth,"
4406,XV.,Propping the skies at top: a dearth
4407,XV.,"Of fire i’ the violet intervals,"
4408,XV.,Leaving exposed the utmost walls
4409,XV.,"Of time, about to tumble in"
4410,XV.,And end the world.
4411,XV.,
4412,XVI.,XVI.
4413,XVI.,
4414,XVI.,I felt begin
4415,XVI.,The Judgment-Day: to retrocede
4416,XVI.,"Was too late now. “In very deed,”"
4417,XVI.,(I uttered to myself) “that Day!”
4418,XVI.,The intuition burned away
4419,XVI.,All darkness from my spirit too:
4420,XVI.,"There, stood I, found and fixed, I knew,"
4421,XVI.,Choosing the world. The choice was made;
4422,XVI.,"And naked and disguiseless stayed,"
4423,XVI.,"And unevadable, the fact."
4424,XVI.,My brain held ne’ertheless compact
4425,XVI.,"Its senses, nor my heart declined"
4426,XVI.,"Its office; rather, both combined"
4427,XVI.,To help me in this juncture. I
4428,XVI.,"Lost not a second,—agony"
4429,XVI.,Gave boldness: since my life had end
4430,XVI.,"And my choice with it—best defend,"
4431,XVI.,"Applaud both! I resolved to say,"
4432,XVI.,"“So was I framed by thee, such way"
4433,XVI.,“I put to use thy senses here!
4434,XVI.,"“It was so beautiful, so near,"
4435,XVI.,"“Thy world,—what could I then but choose"
4436,XVI.,“My part there? Nor did I refuse
4437,XVI.,“To look above the transient boon
4438,XVI.,“Of time; but it was hard so soon
4439,XVI.,"“As in a short life, to give up"
4440,XVI.,“Such beauty: I could put the cup
4441,XVI.,"“Undrained of half its fulness, by;"
4442,XVI.,"“But, to renounce it utterly,"
4443,XVI.,“—That was too hard! Nor did the cry
4444,XVI.,"“Which bade renounce it, touch my brain"
4445,XVI.,“Authentically deep and plain
4446,XVI.,“Enough to make my lips let go.
4447,XVI.,"“But thou, who knowest all, dost know"
4448,XVI.,"“Whether I was not, life’s brief while,"
4449,XVI.,“Endeavouring to reconcile
4450,XVI.,"“Those lips (too tardily, alas!)"
4451,XVI.,"“To letting the dear remnant pass,"
4452,XVI.,"“One day,—some drops of earthly good"
4453,XVI.,"“Untasted! Is it for this mood,"
4454,XVI.,"“That thou, whose earth delights so well,"
4455,XVI.,“Hast made its complement a hell?”
4456,XVI.,
4457,XVII.,XVII.
4458,XVII.,
4459,XVII.,"A final belch of fire like blood,"
4460,XVII.,Overbroke all heaven in one flood
4461,XVII.,"Of doom. Then fire was sky, and sky"
4462,XVII.,"Fire, and both, one brief ecstasy,"
4463,XVII.,Then ashes. But I heard no noise
4464,XVII.,(Whatever was) because a voice
4465,XVII.,"Beside me spoke thus, “Life is done,"
4466,XVII.,"“Time ends, Eternity’s begun,"
4467,XVII.,“And thou art judged for evermore.”
4468,XVII.,
4469,XVII.,"As in “Christmas-Eve,” the question rises of a Presence in the awful"
4470,XVII.,scene.

4475,XIX.,
4476,XIX.,"What if, ’twixt skies"
4477,XIX.,"And prostrate earth, he should surprise"
4478,XIX.,"The imaged vapour, head to foot,"
4479,XIX.,"Surveying, motionless and mute,"
4480,XIX.,"Its work, ere, in a whirlwind rapt"
4481,XIX.,It vanish up again?—So hapt
4482,XIX.,My chance. HE stood there. Like the smoke
4483,XIX.,"Pillared o’er Sodom, when day broke,—"
4484,XIX.,I saw him. One magnific pall
4485,XIX.,Mantled in massive fold and fall
4486,XIX.,"His head, and coiled in snaky swathes"
4487,XIX.,"About his feet: night’s black, that bathes"
4488,XIX.,"All else, broke, grizzled with despair,"
4489,XIX.,Against the soul of blackness there.
4490,XIX.,A gesture told the mood within—
4491,XIX.,That wrapped right hand which based the chin
4492,XIX.,That intense meditation fixed
4493,XIX.,"On his procedure,—pity mixed"
4494,XIX.,With the fulfilment of decree.
4495,XIX.,"Motionless, thus, he spoke to me,"
4496,XIX.,"Who fell before his feet, a mass,"
4497,XIX.,No man now.
4498,XIX.,
4499,XIX.,"Then follows the Sentence, excluding him from the heaven of spirit, and"
4500,XIX.,"leaving him to the world of sense, hopeless for ever of anything"
4501,XIX.,higher—a sentence which seemed to him at first to be rather a reward
4502,XIX.,"than a punishment, as he thought of “earth’s resources—vast exhaustless"
4503,XIX.,"beauty, endless change of wonder!” Even a fern-leaf a museum in itself!"
4504,XIX.,
4505,XIX.,The answer of the Voice to this shallow thought leads us into the very
4506,XIX.,"loftiest regions of the imagination, suggesting views of the future of"
4507,XIX.,the redeemed which make the soul thrill with eager expectancy—
4508,XIX.,
4509,XXIV.,XXIV.
4510,XXIV.,
4511,XXIV.,"Then the Voice, “Welcome so to rate"
4512,XXIV.,“The arras-folds that variegate
4513,XXIV.,"“The earth, God’s antechamber, well!"
4514,XXIV.,"“The wise, who waited there, could tell"
4515,XXIV.,"“By these, what royalties in store"
4516,XXIV.,“Lay one step past the entrance-door.
4517,XXIV.,"“For whom, was reckoned, not too much,"
4518,XXIV.,“This life’s munificence? For such
4519,XXIV.,"“As thou,—a race, whereof scarce one"
4520,XXIV.,"“Was able, in a million,"
4521,XXIV.,“To feel that any marvel lay
4522,XXIV.,“In objects round his feet all day;
4523,XXIV.,"“Scarce one in many millions more,"
4524,XXIV.,"“Willing, if able, to explore"
4525,XXIV.,"“The secreter, minuter charm!"
4526,XXIV.,"“—Brave souls, a fern-leaf could disarm"
4527,XXIV.,"“Of power to cope with God’s intent,—"
4528,XXIV.,“Or scared if the south firmament
4529,XXIV.,“With north-fire did its wings refledge!
4530,XXIV.,“All partial beauty was a pledge
4531,XXIV.,“Of beauty in its plenitude:
4532,XXIV.,"“But since the pledge sufficed thy mood,"
4533,XXIV.,“Retain it! plenitude be theirs
4534,XXIV.,“Who looked above!”
4535,XXIV.,
4536,XXIV.,"At this answer “sharp despairs shot through” him, at the thought of what"
4537,XXIV.,he had missed; but on reflection he finds comfort in the prospect of the
4538,XXIV.,"possibilities of Art. Again the inexorable voice is heard, pronouncing"
4539,XXIV.,"loss unspeakable. Even if he could be a Michelangelo (Buonarroti), it"
4540,XXIV.,would be only the initial earthly stage of his development that was
4541,XXIV.,possible for him. (The whole passage is magnificent; but perhaps the
4542,XXIV.,exquisitely wrought-out illustration of the lizard in its narrow
4543,XXIV.,rock-chamber will be most enjoyed.)

4606,XXVI.,"“To nothingness for ever; so,"
4607,XXVI.,“Has God abolished at a blow
4608,XXVI.,"“This world, wherein his saints were pent,—"
4609,XXVI.,"“Who, though found grateful and content,"
4610,XXVI.,"“With the provision there, as thou,"

4621,XXVI.,"the result of which appears in what follows, spoken of by Professor"
