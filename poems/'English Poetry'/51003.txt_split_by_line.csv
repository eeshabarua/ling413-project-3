78,PREFACE.,
79,PREFACE.,
80,PREFACE.,"The poems contained in this volume, which comprise the whole of the"
81,PREFACE.,"_Tales_ and the first eleven of the _Tales of the Hall_, are without"
82,PREFACE.,"exception printed from the edition of 1823, the last of Crabbe’s"
83,PREFACE.,works published in this country in his lifetime.
84,PREFACE.,
85,PREFACE.,The _Variants_ in the _Tales_ are from the first edition (1812) and
86,PREFACE.,from the ‘Original MS.’ readings given as footnotes in the younger
87,PREFACE.,Crabbe’s edition of his father’s _Life and Poems_ (1834). The
88,PREFACE.,_Variants_ in the _Tales of the Hall_ are from the first edition
89,PREFACE.,(1819); from the ‘Original MS.’ readings as above; from the Crabbe
90,PREFACE.,MSS. in the possession of the Cambridge University Press (which will
91,PREFACE.,"be described in the Preface to Vol. III, where a much fuller use will"
92,PREFACE.,"be made of them), and from the MSS. in the valuable collection of Mrs"
93,PREFACE.,"Mackay of Trowbridge, most kindly lent by her for examination and"
94,PREFACE.,use (to which the same remark applies). In the present volume will
95,PREFACE.,"also be found certain _Addenda_ to the _Variants_ in Vol. I, from the"
96,PREFACE.,‘Original MS.’ readings printed by the younger Crabbe.
97,PREFACE.,
98,PREFACE.,Among the _Errata_ in this volume are included a considerable number
99,PREFACE.,of quotations from Shakespeare with wrong indications of acts or
100,PREFACE.,"scenes, and occasionally even of the plays from which the passages"
101,PREFACE.,are taken. A large proportion of the quotations are in themselves
102,PREFACE.,"imperfect, or otherwise incorrect. Perhaps it is stretching a"
103,PREFACE.,point to treat all these defects as oversights; sometimes Crabbe
104,PREFACE.,"may have made intentional changes, and more frequently he may have"
105,PREFACE.,been wilfully careless. No readings which he could have found in any
106,PREFACE.,current edition of Shakespeare have been altered.
107,PREFACE.,
108,PREFACE.,"In the preparation of the present volume, I have again enjoyed"
109,PREFACE.,the advantage of the friendly aid and cooperation of Mr A. T.
110,PREFACE.,"BARTHOLOMEW, to whom I am specially indebted for the compilation of"
111,PREFACE.,the _Variants_. Our joint efforts have been occasionally defeated
112,PREFACE.,by the illegibility of passages in the Crabbe MSS. acquired by our
113,PREFACE.,University Press. It is hoped that the third and concluding volume of
114,PREFACE.,"this edition, which will contain a considerable amount of previously"
115,PREFACE.,"unpublished verse, will appear in the course of the summer."

173,"MADAM,","MADAM,"
174,"MADAM,",
175,"MADAM,",The dedication of works of literature to persons of superior worth
176,"MADAM,","and eminence appears to have been a measure early adopted, and"
177,"MADAM,","continued to the present time; so that, whatever objections have been"
178,"MADAM,","made to the language of dedicators, such addresses must be considered"
179,"MADAM,","as perfectly consistent with reason and propriety; in fact, superior"
180,"MADAM,",rank and elevated situation in life naturally and justly claim such
181,"MADAM,",respect and it is the prerogative of greatness to give countenance
182,"MADAM,",and favour to all who appear to merit and to need them; it is
183,"MADAM,","likewise the prerogative of every kind of superiority and celebrity,"
184,"MADAM,","of personal merit when peculiar or extraordinary, of dignity,"
185,"MADAM,","elegance, wealth, and beauty, certainly of superior intellect and"
186,"MADAM,",intellectual acquirements; every such kind of eminence has its
187,"MADAM,","privilege, and, being itself an object of distinguished approbation,"
188,"MADAM,",it gains attention for whomsoever its possessor distinguishes and
189,"MADAM,",approves.
190,"MADAM,",
191,"MADAM,",Yet the causes and motives for an address of this kind rest not
192,"MADAM,","entirely with the merit of the patron, the feelings of the author"
193,"MADAM,",himself having their weight and consideration in the choice he makes;
194,"MADAM,","he may have gratitude for benefits received, or pride not illaudable"
195,"MADAM,",in aspiring to the favour of those whose notice confers honour; or
196,"MADAM,",he may entertain a secret but strong desire of seeing a name in the
197,"MADAM,",entrance of his work which he is accustomed to utter with peculiar
198,"MADAM,","satisfaction, and to hear mentioned with veneration and delight."
199,"MADAM,",
200,"MADAM,","Such, madam, are the various kinds of eminence for which an author"
201,"MADAM,","on these occasions would probably seek, and they meet in your grace;"
202,"MADAM,","such too are the feelings by which he would be actuated, and they"
203,"MADAM,",centre in me: let me therefore entreat your grace to take this book
204,"MADAM,","into your favour and protection, and to receive it as an offering of"

218,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
219,PREFACE.,
220,PREFACE.,
221,PREFACE.,That the appearance of the present work before the public is
222,PREFACE.,"occasioned by a favourable reception of the former two, I hesitate"
223,PREFACE.,"not to acknowledge; because, while the confession may be regarded"
224,PREFACE.,"as some proof of gratitude, or at least of attention from an author"
225,PREFACE.,"to his readers, it ought not to be considered as an indication of"
226,PREFACE.,vanity. It is unquestionably very pleasant to be assured that our
227,PREFACE.,"labours are well received; but, nevertheless, this must not be taken"
228,PREFACE.,for a just and full criterion of their merit: publications of great
229,PREFACE.,"intrinsic value have been met with so much coolness, that a writer"
230,PREFACE.,who succeeds in obtaining some degree of notice should look upon
231,PREFACE.,"himself rather as one favoured than meritorious, as gaining a prize"
232,PREFACE.,"from Fortune, and not a recompense for desert; and, on the contrary,"
233,PREFACE.,as it is well known that books of very inferior kind have been at
234,PREFACE.,"once pushed into the strong current of popularity, and are there"
235,PREFACE.,"kept buoyant by the force of the stream, the writer who acquires not"
236,PREFACE.,this adventitious help may be reckoned rather as unfortunate than
237,PREFACE.,"undeserving; and from these opposite considerations it follows, that"
238,PREFACE.,a man may speak of his success without incurring justly the odium of
239,PREFACE.,"conceit, and may likewise acknowledge a disappointment without an"
240,PREFACE.,adequate cause for humiliation or self-reproach.
241,PREFACE.,
242,PREFACE.,But were it true that something of the complacency of
243,PREFACE.,self-approbation would insinuate itself into an author’s mind with
244,PREFACE.,"the idea of success, the sensation would not be that of unalloyed"
245,PREFACE.,"pleasure; it would perhaps assist him to bear, but it would not"
246,PREFACE.,"enable him to escape, the mortification he must encounter from"
247,PREFACE.,"censures, which, though he may be unwilling to admit, yet he finds"
248,PREFACE.,"himself unable to confute; as well as from advice, which, at the same"
249,PREFACE.,"time that he cannot but approve, he is compelled to reject."
250,PREFACE.,
251,PREFACE.,"Reproof and advice, it is probable, every author will receive, if"
252,PREFACE.,"we except those who merit so much of the former, that the latter is"
253,PREFACE.,"contemptuously denied them; now of these, reproof, though it may"
254,PREFACE.,"cause more temporary uneasiness, will in many cases create less"
255,PREFACE.,"difficulty, since errors may be corrected when opportunity occurs;"
256,PREFACE.,"but advice, I repeat, may be of such nature, that it will be painful"
257,PREFACE.,"to reject, and yet impossible to follow it; and in this predicament"
258,PREFACE.,"I conceive myself to be placed. There has been recommended to me,"
259,PREFACE.,and from authority which neither inclination nor prudence leads me
260,PREFACE.,"to resist, in any new work I might undertake, an unity of subject,"
261,PREFACE.,and that arrangement of my materials which connects the whole and
262,PREFACE.,"gives additional interest to every part; in fact, if not an Epic"
263,PREFACE.,"Poem, strictly so denominated, yet such composition as would possess"
264,PREFACE.,"a regular succession of events, and a catastrophe to which every"
265,PREFACE.,"incident should be subservient, and which every character, in a"
266,PREFACE.,"greater or less degree, should conspire to accomplish."
267,PREFACE.,
268,PREFACE.,"In a Poem of this nature, the principal and inferior characters in"
269,PREFACE.,"some degree resemble a general and his army, where no one pursues his"
270,PREFACE.,"peculiar objects and adventures, [but] pursues them in unison with"
271,PREFACE.,the movements and grand purposes of the whole body; where there is a
272,PREFACE.,community of interests and a subordination of actors; and it was upon
273,PREFACE.,"this view of the subject, and of the necessity for such distribution"
274,PREFACE.,"of persons and events, that I found myself obliged to relinquish"
275,PREFACE.,"an undertaking, for which the characters I could command, and the"
276,PREFACE.,"adventures I could describe, were altogether unfitted."
277,PREFACE.,
278,PREFACE.,But if these characters which seemed to be at my disposal were not
279,PREFACE.,"such as would coalesce into one body, nor were of a nature to be"
280,PREFACE.,"commanded by one mind, so neither on examination did they appear as"
281,PREFACE.,"an unconnected multitude, accidentally collected, to be suddenly"
282,PREFACE.,dispersed; but rather beings of whom might be formed groups and
283,PREFACE.,"smaller societies, the relations of whose adventures and pursuits"
284,PREFACE.,"might bear that kind of similitude to an Heroic Poem, which these"
285,PREFACE.,"minor associations of men (as pilgrims on the way to their saint,"
286,PREFACE.,"or parties in search of amusement, travellers excited by curiosity,"
287,PREFACE.,or adventurers in pursuit of gain) have in points of connexion and
288,PREFACE.,importance with a regular and disciplined army.
289,PREFACE.,
290,PREFACE.,"Allowing this comparison, it is manifest that while much is lost for"
291,PREFACE.,"want of unity of subject and grandeur of design, something is gained"
292,PREFACE.,"by greater variety of incident and more minute display of character,"
293,PREFACE.,by accuracy of description and diversity of scene: in these
294,PREFACE.,"narratives we pass from gay to grave, from lively to severe, not only"
295,PREFACE.,"without impropriety, but with manifest advantage. In one continued"
296,PREFACE.,"and connected Poem, the reader is, in general, highly gratified or"
297,PREFACE.,"severely disappointed; by many independent narratives, he has the"
298,PREFACE.,"renovation of hope, although he has been dissatisfied, and a prospect"
299,PREFACE.,"of reiterated pleasure, should he find himself entertained."
300,PREFACE.,
301,PREFACE.,"I mean not, however, to compare these different modes of writing"
302,PREFACE.,as if I were balancing their advantages and defects before I could
303,PREFACE.,give preference to either; with me the way I take is not a matter of
304,PREFACE.,"choice, but of necessity; I present not my Tales to the reader as"
305,PREFACE.,"if I had chosen the best method of ensuring his approbation, but as"
306,PREFACE.,using the only means I possessed of engaging his attention.
307,PREFACE.,
308,PREFACE.,"It may probably be remarked that Tales, however dissimilar, might"
309,PREFACE.,have been connected by some associating circumstance to which the
310,PREFACE.,"whole number might bear equal affinity, and that examples of such"
311,PREFACE.,"union are to be found in Chaucer, in Boccace, and other collectors"
312,PREFACE.,"and inventors of Tales, which, considered in themselves, are"
313,PREFACE.,altogether independent; and to this idea I gave so much consideration
314,PREFACE.,as convinced me that I could not avail myself of the benefit of
315,PREFACE.,"such artificial mode of affinity. To imitate the English poet,"
316,PREFACE.,"characters must be found adapted to their several relations, and"
317,PREFACE.,this is a point of great difficulty and hazard; much allowance seems
318,PREFACE.,"to be required even for Chaucer himself, since it is difficult to"
319,PREFACE.,"conceive that on any occasion the devout and delicate Prioress, the"
320,PREFACE.,"courtly and valiant Knight, and “the poure good Man the persone of"
321,PREFACE.,"a Towne,” would be the voluntary companions of the drunken Miller,"
322,PREFACE.,"the licentious Sompnour, and “the Wanton Wife of Bath,” and enter"
323,PREFACE.,"into that colloquial and travelling intimacy which, if a common"
324,PREFACE.,"pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas may be said to excuse, I know"
325,PREFACE.,nothing beside (and certainly nothing in these times) that would
326,PREFACE.,"produce such effect. Boccace, it is true, avoids all difficulty of"
327,PREFACE.,"this kind, by not assigning to the ten relators of his hundred"
328,PREFACE.,"Tales any marked or peculiar characters; nor, though there are male"
329,PREFACE.,"and female in company, can the sex of the narrator be distinguished"
330,PREFACE.,in the narration. To have followed the method of Chaucer might have
331,PREFACE.,"been of use, but could scarcely be adopted, from its difficulty; and"
332,PREFACE.,to have taken that of the Italian writer would have been perfectly
333,PREFACE.,"easy, but could be of no service: the attempt at union therefore"
334,PREFACE.,"has been relinquished, and these relations are submitted to the"
335,PREFACE.,"public, connected by no other circumstance than their being the"
336,PREFACE.,"productions of the same author, and devoted to the same purpose, the"
337,PREFACE.,entertainment of his readers.
338,PREFACE.,
339,PREFACE.,"It has been already acknowledged, that these compositions have no"
340,PREFACE.,pretensions to be estimated with the more lofty and heroic kind
341,PREFACE.,"of poems, but I feel great reluctance in admitting that they have"
342,PREFACE.,not a fair and legitimate claim to the poetic character. In vulgar
343,PREFACE.,"estimation, indeed, all that is not prose passes for poetry, but"
344,PREFACE.,I have not ambition of so humble a kind as to be satisfied with a
345,PREFACE.,"concession which requires nothing in the poet, except his ability"
346,PREFACE.,"for counting syllables, and I trust something more of the poetic"
347,PREFACE.,character will be allowed to the succeeding pages than what the
348,PREFACE.,heroes of the Dunciad might share with the author; nor was I aware
349,PREFACE.,"that by describing, as faithfully as I could, men, manners, and"
350,PREFACE.,"things, I was forfeiting a just title to a name which has been freely"
351,PREFACE.,"granted to many whom to equal, and even to excel, is but very stinted"
352,PREFACE.,commendation.
353,PREFACE.,
354,PREFACE.,In this case it appears that the usual comparison between poetry and
355,PREFACE.,painting entirely fails: the artist who takes an accurate likeness of
356,PREFACE.,"individuals, or a faithful representation of scenery, may not rank"
357,PREFACE.,so high in the public estimation as one who paints an historical
358,PREFACE.,"event, or an heroic action; but he is nevertheless a painter, and his"
359,PREFACE.,"accuracy is so far from diminishing his reputation, that it procures"
360,PREFACE.,for him in general both fame and emolument; nor is it perhaps with
361,PREFACE.,strict justice determined that the credit and reputation of those
362,PREFACE.,"verses which strongly and faithfully delineate character and manners,"
363,PREFACE.,should be lessened in the opinion of the public by the very accuracy
364,PREFACE.,which gives value and distinction to the productions of the pencil.
365,PREFACE.,
366,PREFACE.,"Nevertheless, it must be granted that the pretensions of any"
367,PREFACE.,composition to be regarded as poetry will depend upon that definition
368,PREFACE.,of the poetic character which he who undertakes to determine the
369,PREFACE.,question has considered as decisive; and it is confessed also that
370,PREFACE.,"one of great authority may be adopted, by which the verses now before"
371,PREFACE.,"the reader, and many others which have probably amused and delighted"
372,PREFACE.,"him, must be excluded: a definition like this will be found in the"
373,PREFACE.,"words which the greatest of poets, not divinely inspired, has given"
374,PREFACE.,to the most noble and valiant Duke of Athens--
375,PREFACE.,
376,PREFACE.,"“The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,"
377,PREFACE.,"Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;"
378,PREFACE.,And as Imagination bodies forth
379,PREFACE.,"The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen"
380,PREFACE.,"Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing"
381,PREFACE.,"A local habitation, and a name[1].”"
382,PREFACE.,
383,PREFACE.,"[1] Midsummer Night’s Dream, Act V. Scene 1."
384,PREFACE.,
385,PREFACE.,"Hence we observe the poet is one who, in the excursions of his"
386,PREFACE.,"fancy between heaven and earth, lights upon a kind of fairyland, in"
387,PREFACE.,"which he places a creation of his own, where he embodies shapes,"
388,PREFACE.,and gives action and adventure to his ideal offspring; taking
389,PREFACE.,"captive the imagination of his readers, he elevates them above the"
390,PREFACE.,"grossness of actual being, into the soothing and pleasant atmosphere"
391,PREFACE.,of supra-mundane existence: there he obtains for his visionary
392,PREFACE.,inhabitants the interest that engages a reader’s attention without
393,PREFACE.,"ruffling his feelings, and excites that moderate kind of sympathy"
394,PREFACE.,"which the realities of nature oftentimes fail to produce, either"
395,PREFACE.,because they are so familiar and insignificant that they excite no
396,PREFACE.,"determinate emotion, or are so harsh and powerful that the feelings"
397,PREFACE.,excited are grating and distasteful.
398,PREFACE.,
399,PREFACE.,Be it then granted that (as Duke Theseus observes) “such tricks
400,PREFACE.,"hath strong Imagination,” and that such poets “are of imagination"
401,PREFACE.,"all compact;” let it be further conceded, that theirs is a higher"
402,PREFACE.,"and more dignified kind of composition, nay, the only kind that"
403,PREFACE.,"has pretensions to inspiration: still, that these poets should so"
404,PREFACE.,entirely engross the title as to exclude those who address their
405,PREFACE.,"productions to the plain sense and sober judgment of their readers,"
406,PREFACE.,"rather than to their fancy and imagination, I must repeat that I am"
407,PREFACE.,"unwilling to admit--because I conceive that, by granting such right"
408,PREFACE.,"of exclusion, a vast deal of what has been hitherto received as"
409,PREFACE.,genuine poetry would no longer be entitled to that appellation.
410,PREFACE.,
411,PREFACE.,All that kind of satire wherein character is skillfully delineated
412,PREFACE.,must (this criterion being allowed) no longer be esteemed as genuine
413,PREFACE.,poetry; and for the same reason many affecting narratives which
414,PREFACE.,"are founded on real events, and borrow no aid whatever from the"
415,PREFACE.,"imagination of the writer, must likewise be rejected: a considerable"
416,PREFACE.,"part of the poems, as they have hitherto been denominated, of"
417,PREFACE.,"Chaucer, are of this naked and unveiled character; and there are"
418,PREFACE.,"in his Tales many pages of coarse, accurate, and minute, but very"
419,PREFACE.,"striking description. Many small poems in a subsequent age, of most"
420,PREFACE.,"impressive kind, are adapted and addressed to the common sense of"
421,PREFACE.,"the reader, and prevail by the strong language of truth and nature;"
422,PREFACE.,"they amused our ancestors, and they continue to engage our interest,"
423,PREFACE.,"and excite our feelings, by the same powerful appeals to the heart"
424,PREFACE.,"and affections. In times less remote, Dryden has given us much"
425,PREFACE.,"of this poetry, in which the force of expression and accuracy of"
426,PREFACE.,description have neither needed nor obtained assistance from the
427,PREFACE.,fancy of the writer; the characters in his Absalom and Achitophel are
428,PREFACE.,"instances of this, and more especially those of Doeg and Og in the"
429,PREFACE.,"second part: these, with all their grossness, and almost offensive"
430,PREFACE.,"accuracy, are found to possess that strength and spirit which has"
431,PREFACE.,"preserved from utter annihilation the dead bodies of Tate, to whom"
432,PREFACE.,"they were inhumanly bound, happily with a fate the reverse of that"
433,PREFACE.,caused by the cruelty of Mezentius; for there the living perished
434,PREFACE.,"in the putrefaction of the dead, and here the dead are preserved"
435,PREFACE.,"by the vitality of the living. And, to bring forward one other"
436,PREFACE.,"example, it will be found that Pope himself has no small portion of"
437,PREFACE.,"this actuality of relation, this nudity of description, and poetry"
438,PREFACE.,"without an atmosphere; the lines beginning, “In the worst inn’s worst"
439,PREFACE.,"room,” are an example, and many others may be seen in his Satires,"
440,PREFACE.,"Imitations, and above all in his Dunciad: the frequent absence of"
441,PREFACE.,"those “Sports of Fancy,” and “Tricks of strong Imagination,” have"
442,PREFACE.,"been so much observed, that some have ventured to question whether"
443,PREFACE.,"even this writer were a poet; and though, as Dr. Johnson has"
444,PREFACE.,"remarked, it would be difficult to form a definition of one in which"
445,PREFACE.,"Pope should not be admitted, yet they who doubted his claim, had,"
446,PREFACE.,"it is likely, provided for his exclusion by forming that kind of"
447,PREFACE.,"character for their poet, in which this elegant versifier, for so he"
448,PREFACE.,"must be then named, should not be comprehended."
449,PREFACE.,
450,PREFACE.,"These things considered, an author will find comfort in his expulsion"
451,PREFACE.,"from the rank and society of poets, by reflecting that men much his"
452,PREFACE.,"superiors were likewise shut out, and more especially when he finds"
453,PREFACE.,also that men not much his superiors are entitled to admission.
454,PREFACE.,
455,PREFACE.,But in whatever degree I may venture to differ from any others in
456,PREFACE.,"my notions of the qualifications and character of the true poet, I"
457,PREFACE.,most cordially assent to their opinion who assert that his principal
458,PREFACE.,exertions must be made to engage the attention of his readers; and
459,PREFACE.,"further, I must allow that the effect of poetry should be to lift"
460,PREFACE.,"the mind from the painful realities of actual existence, from its"
461,PREFACE.,"every-day concerns, and its perpetually occurring vexations, and"
462,PREFACE.,to give it repose by substituting objects in their place which it
463,PREFACE.,may contemplate with some degree of interest and satisfaction; but
464,PREFACE.,"what is there in all this, which may not be effected by a fair"
465,PREFACE.,"representation of existing character? nay, by a faithful delineation"
466,PREFACE.,"of those painful realities, those every-day concerns, and those"
467,PREFACE.,"perpetually-occurring vexations themselves, provided they be not"
468,PREFACE.,(which is hardly to be supposed) the very concerns and distresses of
469,PREFACE.,"the reader? for, when it is admitted that they have no particular"
470,PREFACE.,"relation to him, but are the troubles and anxieties of other men,"
471,PREFACE.,"they excite and interest his feelings as the imaginary exploits,"
472,PREFACE.,"adventures, and perils of romance;--they soothe his mind, and keep"
473,PREFACE.,his curiosity pleasantly awake; they appear to have enough of
474,PREFACE.,"reality to engage his sympathy, but possess not interest sufficient"
475,PREFACE.,"to create painful sensations. Fiction itself, we know, and every"
476,PREFACE.,"work of fancy, must for a time have the effect of realities; nay,"
477,PREFACE.,"the very enchanters, spirits, and monsters of Ariosto and Spenser"
478,PREFACE.,must be present in the mind of the reader while he is engaged by
479,PREFACE.,"their operations, or they would be as the objects and incidents of"
480,PREFACE.,"a nursery tale to a rational understanding, altogether despised and"
481,PREFACE.,"neglected: in truth, I can but consider this pleasant effect upon"
482,PREFACE.,the mind of a reader as depending neither upon the events related
483,PREFACE.,"(whether they be actual or imaginary), nor upon the characters"
484,PREFACE.,"introduced (whether taken from life or fancy), but upon the manner"
485,PREFACE.,in which the poem itself is conducted; let that be judiciously
486,PREFACE.,"managed, and the occurrences actually copied from life will have the"
487,PREFACE.,"same happy effect as the inventions of a creative fancy;--while, on"
488,PREFACE.,"the other hand, the imaginary persons and incidents to which the"
489,PREFACE.,"poet has given “a local habitation, and a name,” will make upon the"
490,PREFACE.,concurring feelings of the reader the same impressions with those
491,PREFACE.,"taken from truth and nature, because they will appear to be derived"
492,PREFACE.,"from that source, and therefore of necessity will have a similar"
493,PREFACE.,effect.
494,PREFACE.,
495,PREFACE.,Having thus far presumed to claim for the ensuing pages the rank and
496,PREFACE.,"title of poetry, I attempt no more, nor venture to class or compare"
497,PREFACE.,them with any other kinds of poetical composition; their place will
498,PREFACE.,doubtless be found for them.
499,PREFACE.,
500,PREFACE.,A principal view and wish of the poet must be to engage the mind of
501,PREFACE.,"his readers, as, failing in that point, he will scarcely succeed in"
502,PREFACE.,any other: I therefore willingly confess that much of my time and
503,PREFACE.,"assiduity has been devoted to this purpose; but, to the ambition of"
504,PREFACE.,"pleasing, no other sacrifices have, I trust, been made, than of my"
505,PREFACE.,own labour and care. Nothing will be found that militates against the
506,PREFACE.,"rules of propriety and good manners, nothing that offends against"
507,PREFACE.,the more important precepts of morality and religion; and with this
508,PREFACE.,"negative kind of merit, I commit my book to the judgment and taste of"
509,PREFACE.,the reader--not being willing to provoke his vigilance by professions
510,PREFACE.,"of accuracy, nor to solicit his indulgence by apologies for mistakes."

642,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Silent two days, he then began to long                 100"
643,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Again to try a voice so loud and strong;
644,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"To give his favourite topics some new grace,"
645,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And gain some glory in such distant place;
646,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"To reap some present pleasure, and to sow"
647,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Seeds of fair fame, in after-time to grow:"
648,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Here will men say, “We heard, at such an hour,"
649,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,The best of speakers--wonderful his power.”
650,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Inquiry made, he found that day would meet"
651,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"A learned club, and in the very street:"
652,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Knowledge to gain and give, was the design;              110"
653,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"To speak, to hearken, to debate, and dine:"
654,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"This pleased our traveller, for he felt his force"
655,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"In either way, to eat or to discourse."
656,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Nothing more easy than to gain access
657,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"To men like these, with his polite address:"
658,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"So he succeeded, and first look’d around,"
659,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,To view his objects and to take his ground;
660,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And therefore silent chose awhile to sit,"
661,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Then enter boldly by some lucky hit,"
662,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Some observation keen or stroke severe,                  120"
663,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,To cause some wonder or excite some fear.
664,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Now, dinner past, no longer he suppress’d"
665,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,His strong dislike to be a silent guest;
666,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Subjects and words were now at his command--
667,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,When disappointment frown’d on all he plann’d;
668,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"For, hark!--he heard, amazed, on every side,"
669,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,His church insulted and her priests belied;
670,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The laws reviled, the ruling power abused,"
671,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The land derided, and its foes excused:--"
672,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He heard and ponder’d.--What, to men so vile,            130"
673,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Should be his language? For his threat’ning style
674,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"They were too many;--if his speech were meek,"
675,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,They would despise such poor attempts to speak:
676,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"At other times with every word at will,"
677,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He now sat lost, perplex’d, astonish’d, still."
678,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Here were Socinians, Deists, and indeed               }"
679,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"All who, as foes to England’s church, agreed;           }"
680,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"But still with creeds unlike, and some without a creed: }"
681,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Here, too, fierce friends of liberty he saw,"
682,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Who own’d no prince and who obey no law;                 140
683,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"There were Reformers of each different sort,"
684,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Foes to the laws, the priesthood, and the court;"
685,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Some on their favourite plans alone intent,"
686,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Some purely angry and malevolent:
687,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,The rash were proud to blame their country’s laws;
688,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The vain, to seem supporters of a cause;"
689,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,One call’d for change that he would dread to see;
690,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Another sigh’d for Gallic liberty!
691,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And numbers joining with the forward crew,"
692,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,For no one reason--but that numbers do.                  150
693,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“How,” said the Justice, “can this trouble rise,"
694,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"This shame and pain, from creatures I despise?”"
695,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And conscience answer’d--“The prevailing cause
696,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Is thy delight in listening to applause;
697,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Here, thou art seated with a tribe, who spurn"
698,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Thy favourite themes, and into laughter turn"
699,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Thy fears and wishes; silent and obscure,"
700,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Thyself, shalt thou the long harangue endure;"
701,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And learn, by feeling, what it is to force"
702,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,On thy unwilling friends the long discourse.             160
703,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"What though thy thoughts be just, and these, it seems,"
704,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Are traitors’ projects, idiots’ empty schemes:"
705,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Yet minds like bodies cramm’d, reject their food,"
706,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Nor will be forced and tortured for their good!”
707,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"At length, a sharp, shrewd, sallow man arose,"
708,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And begg’d he briefly might his mind disclose;
709,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“It was his duty, in these worst of times,"
710,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,T’ inform the govern’d of their rulers’ crimes.”
711,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"This pleasant subject to attend, they each"
712,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Prepared to listen, and forbore to teach.                170"
713,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Then, voluble and fierce, the wordy man"
714,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Through a long chain of favourite horrors ran:--
715,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"First, of the church, from whose enslaving power"
716,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He was deliver’d, and he bless’d the hour;"
717,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“Bishops and deans, and prebendaries all,”"
718,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He said, “were cattle fatt’ning in the stall;"
719,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Slothful and pursy, insolent and mean,"
720,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Were every bishop, prebendary, dean,"
721,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And wealthy rector; curates, poorly paid,"
722,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Were only dull;--he would not them upbraid.”             180
723,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"From priests he turn’d to canons, creeds, and prayers,"
724,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Rubrics and rules, and all our church affairs;"
725,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Churches themselves, desk, pulpit, altar, all"
726,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,The Justice reverenced--and pronounced their fall.
727,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Then from religion Hammond turn’d his view,"
728,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,To give our rulers the correction due;
729,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Not one wise action had these triflers plann’d;
730,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"There was, it seem’d, no wisdom in the land;"
731,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Save in this patriot tribe, who meet at times"
732,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,To show the statesman’s errors and his crimes.           190
733,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Now here was Justice Bolt compell’d to sit,"
734,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"To hear the deist’s scorn, the rebel’s wit;"
735,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The fact mis-stated, the envenom’d lie,"
736,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And staring, spell-bound, made not one reply."
737,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Then were our laws abused--and with the laws,"
738,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"All who prepare, defend, or judge a cause:"
739,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“We have no lawyer whom a man can trust,”"
740,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Proceeded Hammond--“if the laws were just;
741,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,But they are evil; ’tis the savage state
742,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Is only good, and ours sophisticate!                     200"
743,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"See! the free creatures in their woods and plains,"
744,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Where without laws each happy monarch reigns,"
745,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"King of himself--while we a number dread,"
746,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,By slaves commanded and by dunces led;
747,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Oh, let the name with either state agree--"
748,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Savage our own we’ll name, and civil theirs shall be.”"
749,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The silent Justice still astonish’d sate,"
750,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And wonder’d much whom he was gazing at;
751,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Twice he essay’d to speak--but in a cough
752,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The faint, indignant, dying speech went off:             210"
753,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“But who is this?” thought he--“a dæmon vile,"
754,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,With wicked meaning and a vulgar style:
755,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Hammond they call him; they can give the name
756,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Of man to devils.--Why am I so tame?
757,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Why crush I not the viper?”--Fear replied,"
758,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“Watch him awhile, and let his strength be tried;"
759,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He will be foil’d, if man; but if his aid"
760,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Be from beneath, ’tis well to be afraid.”"
761,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,“We are call’d free!” said Hammond--“doleful times
762,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,When rulers add their insult to their crimes;            220
763,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"For, should our scorn expose each powerful vice,"
764,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"It would be libel, and we pay the price.”"
765,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Thus with licentious words the man went on,"
766,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Proving that liberty of speech was gone;
767,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,That all were slaves--nor had we better chance
768,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,For better times than as allies to France.
769,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Loud groan’d the stranger--Why, he must relate,"
770,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And own’d, “In sorrow for his country’s fate.”"
771,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“Nay, she were safe,” the ready man replied,"
772,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“Might patriots rule her, and could reasoners guide;     230"
773,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"When all to vote, to speak, to teach, are free,"
774,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Whate’er their creeds or their opinions be;
775,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"When books of statutes are consumed in flames,"
776,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And courts and copyholds are empty names;
777,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Then will be times of joy--but ere they come,"
778,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Havock, and war, and blood must be our doom.”"
779,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,The man here paused--then loudly for reform
780,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He call’d, and hail’d the prospect of the storm;"
781,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The wholesome blast, the fertilizing flood--"
782,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Peace gain’d by tumult, plenty bought with blood:        240"
783,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Sharp means, he own’d; but when the land’s disease"
784,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Asks cure complete, no med’cines are like these."
785,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Our Justice now, more led by fear than rage,"
786,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Saw it in vain with madness to engage;
787,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"With imps of darkness no man seeks to fight,"
788,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Knaves to instruct, or set deceivers right."
789,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Then, as the daring speech denounced these woes,"
790,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Sick at the soul, the grieving guest arose;"
791,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Quick on the board his ready cash he threw,"
792,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And from the dæmons to his closet flew.                  250
793,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"There when secured, he pray’d with earnest zeal,"
794,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,That all they wish’d these patriot-souls might feel;
795,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“Let them to France, their darling country, haste,"
796,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And all the comforts of a Frenchman taste;
797,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Let them his safety, freedom, pleasure know,      }"

799,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And be at length dismiss’d by one unerring blow;  }
800,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Not hack’d and hew’d by one afraid to strike,"
801,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,But shorn by that which shears all men alike;
802,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Nor, as in Britain, let them curse delay          }      260"
803,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Of law, but borne without a form away--           }"
804,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Suspected, tried, condemn’d, and carted in a day; }"
805,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Oh! let them taste what they so much approve,"
806,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,These strong fierce freedoms of the land they love[2].”
807,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Home came our hero, to forget no more"
808,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,The fear he felt and ever most deplore:
809,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"For, though he quickly join’d his friends again,"
810,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And could with decent force his themes maintain,"
811,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Still it occurr’d that, in a luckless time,"
812,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,He fail’d to fight with heresy and crime;                270
813,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"It was observed his words were not so strong,"
814,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"His tones so powerful, his harangues so long,"
815,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,As in old times--for he would often drop
816,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The lofty look, and of a sudden stop;"
817,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"When conscience whisper’d, that he once was still,"
818,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And let the wicked triumph at their will;
819,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And therefore now, when not a foe was near,"
820,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,He had no right so valiant to appear.
821,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Some years had pass’d, and he perceived his fears"
822,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Yield to the spirit of his earlier years--              280
823,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"When at a meeting, with his friends beside,"
824,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,He saw an object that awaked his pride;
825,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"His shame, wrath, vengeance, indignation--all"
826,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Man’s harsher feelings did that sight recall.
827,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"For lo! beneath him fix’d, our man of law"
828,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,That lawless man the foe of order saw--
829,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Once fear’d, now scorn’d; once dreaded, now abhorr’d;"
830,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"A wordy man, and evil every word."
831,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Again he gazed--“It is,” said he, “the same;"
832,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Caught and secure: his master owes him shame:”           290
833,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"So thought our hero, who each instant found"
834,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"His courage rising, from the numbers round."
835,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"As when a felon has escaped and fled,"
836,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"So long, that law conceives the culprit dead;"
837,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"And back recall’d her myrmidons, intent"
838,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"On some new game, and with a stronger scent;"
839,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Till she beholds him in a place, where none"
840,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Could have conceived the culprit would have gone;
841,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"There he sits upright in his seat, secure,"
842,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,As one whose conscience is correct and pure;             300
843,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"This rouses anger for the old offence,"
844,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And scorn for all such seeming and pretence:
845,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"So on this Hammond look’d our hero bold,"
846,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Rememb’ring well that vile offence of old;
847,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,And now he saw the rebel dared t’ intrude                  }

849,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The crime provoked his wrath, the folly stirr’d his blood. }"
850,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Nor wonder was it if so strange a sight
851,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Caused joy with vengeance, terror with delight;"
852,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Terror like this a tiger might create,               }  310"
853,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"A joy like that to see his captive state,            }"
854,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,At once to know his force and then decree his fate.  }
855,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Hammond, much praised by numerous friends, was come"
856,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"To read his lectures, so admired at home:"
857,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Historic lectures, where he loved to mix"
858,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,His free plain hints on modern politics.
859,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Here, he had heard, that numbers had design,"
860,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Their business finish’d, to sit down and dine;"
861,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"This gave him pleasure, for he judged it right"
862,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"To show by day, that he could speak at night.            320"
863,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Rash the design--for he perceived, too late,"
864,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Not one approving friend beside him sate;
865,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"The greater number, whom he traced around,"
866,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Were men in black, and he conceived they frown’d."
867,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"“I will not speak,” he thought; “no pearls of mine"
868,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Shall be presented to this herd of swine;”
869,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Not this avail’d him, when he cast his eye"
870,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"On Justice Bolt; he could not fight, nor fly."
871,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He saw a man to whom he gave the pain,"
872,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Which now he felt must be return’d again;                330
873,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,His conscience told him with what keen delight
874,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He, at that time, enjoy’d a stranger’s fright;"
875,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"That stranger now befriended--he alone,"
876,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"For all his insult, friendless, to atone;"
877,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,Now he could feel it cruel that a heart
878,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Should be distress’d, and none to take its part;"

882,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Vain hope! the Justice saw the foe’s distress,         340"
883,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,With exultation he could not suppress;
884,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"He felt the fish was hook’d--and so forbore,"
885,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"In playful spite, to draw it to the shore."
886,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Hammond look’d round again; but none were near,"
887,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"With friendly smile, to still his growing fear;"
888,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,But all above him seem’d a solemn row
889,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,"Of priests and deacons, so they seem’d below;"
890,TALE I. _THE DUMB ORATORS._,He wonder’d who his right-hand man might be--

1179,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"From her would seamen in the evening come,"
1180,_THE PARTING HOUR._,To take th’ advent’rous Allen from his home;
1181,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"With his own friends the final day he pass’d,"
1182,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And every painful hour, except the last."
1183,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The grieving father urged the cheerful glass,"
1184,_THE PARTING HOUR._,To make the moments with less sorrow pass;
1185,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Intent the mother look’d upon her son,"
1186,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And wish’d th’ assent withdrawn, the deed undone;"
1187,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The younger sister, as he took his way,"
1188,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Hung on his coat, and begg’d for more delay:             120"
1189,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But his own Judith call’d him to the shore,"
1190,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Whom he must meet, for they might meet no more;--"
1191,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And there he found her--faithful, mournful, true,"
1192,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Weeping and waiting for a last adieu!
1193,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The ebbing tide had left the sand, and there"
1194,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Moved with slow steps the melancholy pair:
1195,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Sweet were the painful moments--but how sweet,"
1196,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And without pain, when they again should meet!"
1197,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Now either spoke, as hope and fear impress’d"
1198,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Each their alternate triumph in the breast.              130
1199,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Distance alarm’d the maid--she cried, “’Tis far!”"
1200,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And danger too--“it is a time of war.
1201,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Then, in those countries are diseases strange,"
1202,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And women gay, and men are prone to change;"
1203,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"What, then, may happen in a year, when things"
1204,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Of vast importance every moment brings!
1205,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But hark! an oar!” she cried, yet none appear’d--"
1206,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"’Twas love’s mistake, who fancied what it fear’d;"
1207,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And she continued--“Do, my Allen, keep"
1208,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Thy heart from evil, let thy passions sleep;             140"
1209,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Believe it good, nay glorious, to prevail,"
1210,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And stand in safety where so many fail;
1211,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And do not, Allen, or for shame, or pride,"
1212,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Thy faith abjure, or thy profession hide;"
1213,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Can I believe _his_ love will lasting prove,"
1214,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Who has no rev’rence for the God I love?
1215,_THE PARTING HOUR._,I know thee well! how good thou art and kind;
1216,_THE PARTING HOUR._,But strong the passions that invade thy mind.--
1217,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Now, what to me hath Allen to commend?”--"
1218,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“Upon my mother,” said the youth, “attend;               150"
1219,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Forget her spleen, and in my place appear;"
1220,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Her love to me will make my Judith dear:
1221,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Oft I shall think (such comfort lovers seek),"
1222,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Who speaks of me, and fancy what they speak;"
1223,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Then write on all occasions, always dwell"
1224,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"On hope’s fair prospects, and be kind and well,"
1225,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And ever choose the fondest, tenderest style.”"
1226,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"She answer’d, “No,” but answer’d with a smile."
1227,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“And now, my Judith, at so sad a time,"
1228,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Forgive my fear, and call it not my crime;               160"
1229,_THE PARTING HOUR._,When with our youthful neighbours ’tis thy chance
1230,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"To meet in walks, the visit or the dance,"
1231,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"When every lad would on my lass attend,"
1232,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Choose not a smooth designer for a friend;
1233,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"That fawning Philip!--nay, be not severe,"
1234,_THE PARTING HOUR._,A rival’s hope must cause a lover’s fear.”
1235,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Displeased she felt, and might in her reply"
1236,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Have mix’d some anger, but the boat was nigh,"
1237,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Now truly heard!--it soon was full in sight;--
1238,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Now the sad farewell, and the long good-night;           170"
1239,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"For, see!--his friends come hast’ning to the beach,"
1240,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And now the gunwale is within the reach;
1241,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“Adieu!--farewell!--remember!”--and what more
1242,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Affection taught, was utter’d from the shore!"
1243,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But Judith left them with a heavy heart,"
1244,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Took a last view, and went to weep apart!"
1245,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And now his friends went slowly from the place,"
1246,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Where she stood still, the dashing oar to trace,"
1247,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Till all were silent!--for the youth she pray’d,"
1248,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And softly then return’d the weeping maid.               180
1249,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"They parted, thus by hope and fortune led,"
1250,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And Judith’s hours in pensive pleasure fled.
1251,_THE PARTING HOUR._,But when return’d the youth?--the youth no more
1252,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Return’d exulting to his native shore.
1253,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But forty years were past, and then there came             }"
1254,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"A worn-out man with wither’d limbs and lame,               }"
1255,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"His mind oppress’d with woes, and bent with age his frame: }"
1256,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Yes! old and grieved, and trembling with decay,              }"
1257,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Was Allen landing in his native bay,                         }"
1258,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Willing his breathless form should blend with kindred clay.  }
1259,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"In an autumnal eve he left the beach,                    191"
1260,_THE PARTING HOUR._,In such an eve he chanced the port to reach.
1261,_THE PARTING HOUR._,He was alone; he press’d the very place
1262,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Of the sad parting, of the last embrace:"
1263,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"There stood his parents, there retired the maid,"
1264,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"So fond, so tender, and so much afraid;"
1265,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And on that spot, through many a year, his mind"
1266,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Turn’d mournful back, half sinking, half resign’d."
1267,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"No one was present; of its crew bereft,"
1268,_THE PARTING HOUR._,A single boat was in the billows left;                   200
1269,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Sent from some anchor’d vessel in the bay,"
1270,_THE PARTING HOUR._,At the returning tide to sail away.
1271,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"O’er the black stern the moonlight softly play’d,"
1272,_THE PARTING HOUR._,The loosen’d foresail flapping in the shade;
1273,_THE PARTING HOUR._,All silent else on shore; but from the town
1274,_THE PARTING HOUR._,A drowsy peal of distant bells came down;
1275,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"From the tall houses here and there, a light"
1276,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Served some confused remembrance to excite:
1277,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“There,” he observed, and new emotions felt,"
1278,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“Was my first home--and yonder Judith dwelt;             210
1279,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Dead! dead are all! I long--I fear to know,”"
1280,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He said, and walk’d impatient, and yet slow."
1281,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Sudden there broke upon his grief a noise
1282,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Of merry tumult and of vulgar joys:
1283,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Seamen returning to their ship, were come,"
1284,_THE PARTING HOUR._,With idle numbers straying from their home;
1285,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Allen among them mix’d, and in the old"
1286,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Strove some familiar features to behold;
1287,_THE PARTING HOUR._,While fancy aided memory;--“Man! what cheer?”
1288,_THE PARTING HOUR._,A sailor cried; “Art thou at anchor here?”               220
1289,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Faintly he answer’d, and then tried to trace"
1290,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Some youthful features in some aged face;
1291,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"A swarthy matron he beheld, and thought"
1292,_THE PARTING HOUR._,She might unfold the very truths he sought;
1293,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Confused and trembling, he the dame address’d:"
1294,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“The Booths! yet live they?” pausing and oppress’d;
1295,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Then spake again:--“Is there no ancient man,"
1296,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"David his name?--assist me, if you can.--"
1297,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Flemmings there were--and Judith, doth she live?”"
1298,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The woman gazed, nor could an answer give;               230"
1299,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Yet wond’ring stood, and all were silent by,"
1300,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Feeling a strange and solemn sympathy.
1301,_THE PARTING HOUR._,The woman musing said--“She knew full well
1302,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Where the old people came at last to dwell;
1303,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"They had a married daughter and a son,"
1304,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But they were dead, and now remain’d not one.”"
1305,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“Yes,” said an elder, who had paused intent"
1306,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"On days long past, “there was a sad event;--"
1307,_THE PARTING HOUR._,One of these Booths--it was my mother’s tale--
1308,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Here left his lass, I know not where to sail;            240"
1309,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"She saw their parting, and observed the pain;"
1310,_THE PARTING HOUR._,But never came th’ unhappy man again.”
1311,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“The ship was captured”--Allen meekly said,"
1312,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“And what became of the forsaken maid?”
1313,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The woman answer’d: “I remember now,"
1314,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"She used to tell the lasses of her vow,"
1315,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And of her lover’s loss, and I have seen"
1316,_THE PARTING HOUR._,The gayest hearts grow sad where she has been;
1317,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Yet in her grief she married, and was made"
1318,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Slave to a wretch, whom meekly she obey’d                250"
1319,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And early buried--but I know no more.
1320,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And hark! our friends are hast’ning to the shore.”
1321,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Allen soon found a lodging in the town,"
1322,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And walk’d, a man unnoticed, up and down."
1323,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"This house, and this, he knew, and thought a face"
1324,_THE PARTING HOUR._,He sometimes could among a number trace;
1325,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Of names remember’d there remain’d a few,"
1326,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But of no favourites, and the rest were new;"
1327,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"A merchant’s wealth, when Allen went to sea,"
1328,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Was reckon’d boundless.--Could he living be?             260
1329,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Or lived his son? for one he had, the heir"
1330,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"To a vast business, and a fortune fair."
1331,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"No! but that heir’s poor widow, from her shed,"
1332,_THE PARTING HOUR._,With crutches went to take her dole of bread.
1333,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"There was a friend whom he had left a boy,"
1334,_THE PARTING HOUR._,With hope to sail the master of a hoy;
1335,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Him, after many a stormy day, he found"
1336,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"With his great wish, his life’s whole purpose, crown’d."
1337,_THE PARTING HOUR._,This hoy’s proud captain look’d in Allen’s face;--
1338,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“Yours is, my friend,” said he, “a woful case;           270"
1339,_THE PARTING HOUR._,We cannot all succeed; I now command
1340,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The Betsy sloop, and am not much at land;"
1341,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But when we meet, you shall your story tell"
1342,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Of foreign parts--I bid you now farewell!”
1343,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Allen so long had left his native shore,"
1344,_THE PARTING HOUR._,He saw but few whom he had seen before;
1345,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The older people, as they met him, cast"
1346,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"A pitying look, oft speaking as they pass’d:--"
1347,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“The man is Allen Booth, and it appears"
1348,_THE PARTING HOUR._,He dwelt among us in his early years;                    280
1349,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"We see the name engraved upon the stones,"
1350,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Where this poor wanderer means to lay his bones.”
1351,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Thus where he lived and loved--unhappy change!--
1352,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He seems a stranger, and finds all are strange."
1353,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But now a widow, in a village near,"
1354,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Chanced of the melancholy man to hear;
1355,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Old as she was, to Judith’s bosom came"
1356,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Some strong emotions at the well-known name;
1357,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He was her much-loved Allen, she had stay’d"
1358,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Ten troubled years, a sad afflicted maid;                290"
1359,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Then was she wedded, of his death assured,"
1360,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And much of mis’ry in her lot endured;
1361,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Her husband died; her children sought their bread
1362,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"In various places, and to her were dead."
1363,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The once fond lovers met; not grief nor age,"
1364,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Sickness or pain, their hearts could disengage:"
1365,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Each had immediate confidence; a friend
1366,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Both now beheld, on whom they might depend:"
1367,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“Now is there one to whom I can express
1368,_THE PARTING HOUR._,My nature’s weakness and my soul’s distress.”            300
1369,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Allen look’d up, and with impatient heart:--"
1370,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“Let me not lose thee--never let us part;
1371,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"So Heaven this comfort to my sufferings give,"
1372,_THE PARTING HOUR._,It is not all distress to think and live.”
1373,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Thus Allen spoke--for time had not removed
1374,_THE PARTING HOUR._,The charms attach’d to one so fondly loved;
1375,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Who with more health, the mistress of their cot,"
1376,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Labours to soothe the evils of his lot.
1377,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"To her, to her alone, his various fate,"
1378,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"At various times, ’tis comfort to relate;                310"
1379,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And yet his sorrow she too loves to hear
1380,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"What wrings her bosom, and compels the tear."
1381,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"First he related how he left the shore,"
1382,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Alarm’d with fears that they should meet no more;
1383,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Then, ere the ship had reach’d her purposed course,"
1384,_THE PARTING HOUR._,They met and yielded to the Spanish force;
1385,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Then ’cross th’ Atlantic seas they bore their prey,"
1386,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Who grieving landed from their sultry bay;
1387,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And, marching many a burning league, he found"
1388,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Himself a slave upon a miner’s ground:                   320
1389,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"There a good priest his native language spoke,"
1390,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And gave some ease to his tormenting yoke;
1391,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Kindly advanced him in his master’s grace,"
1392,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And he was station’d in an easier place.
1393,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"There, hopeless ever to escape the land,"
1394,_THE PARTING HOUR._,He to a Spanish maiden gave his hand;
1395,_THE PARTING HOUR._,In cottage shelter’d from the blaze of day
1396,_THE PARTING HOUR._,He saw his happy infants round him play;
1397,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Where summer shadows, made by lofty trees,"
1398,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Waved o’er his seat, and soothed his reveries;           330"
1399,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"E’en then he thought of England, nor could sigh,"
1400,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But his fond Isabel demanded, “Why?”"
1401,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Grieved by the story, she the sigh repaid,"
1402,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And wept in pity for the English maid:
1403,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Thus twenty years were pass’d, and pass’d his views"
1404,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Of further bliss, for he had wealth to lose."
1405,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"His friend now dead, some foe had dared to paint"
1406,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“His faith as tainted: he his spouse would taint;
1407,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Make all his children infidels, and found"
1408,_THE PARTING HOUR._,An English heresy on Christian ground.”                  340
1409,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“Whilst I was poor,” said Allen, “none would care"
1410,_THE PARTING HOUR._,What my poor notions of religion were;
1411,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"None ask’d me whom I worshipp’d, how I pray’d,"
1412,_THE PARTING HOUR._,If due obedience to the laws were paid:
1413,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"My good adviser taught me to be still,"
1414,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Nor to make converts had I power or will.
1415,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"I preached no foreign doctrine to my wife,"
1416,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And never mention’d Luther in my life;
1417,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"I, all they said, say what they would, allow’d,"
1418,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And when the fathers bade me bow, I bow’d;               350"
1419,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Their forms I follow’d, whether well or sick,"
1420,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And was a most obedient Catholic.
1421,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But I had money, and these pastors found"
1422,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"My notions vague, heretical, unsound:"
1423,_THE PARTING HOUR._,A wicked book they seized; the very Turk
1424,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Could not have read a more pernicious work;
1425,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"To me pernicious, who if it were good"
1426,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Or evil question’d not, nor understood:"
1427,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Oh! had I little but the book possess’d,"
1428,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"I might have read it, and enjoy’d my rest.”              360"
1429,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Alas! poor Allen, through his wealth was seen"
1430,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Crimes that by poverty conceal’d had been:
1431,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Faults that in dusty pictures rest unknown
1432,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Are in an instant through the varnish shown.
1433,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He told their cruel mercy: how at last,"
1434,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"In Christian kindness for the merits past,"
1435,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"They spared his forfeit life, but bade him fly,"
1436,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Or for his crime and contumacy die;
1437,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Fly from all scenes, all objects of delight;           }"
1438,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"His wife, his children, weeping in his sight,          } 370"
1439,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"All urging him to flee, he fled, and cursed his flight.}"
1440,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He next related how he found a way,"
1441,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Guideless and grieving, to Campeachy Bay:"
1442,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"There in the woods he wrought, and there, among"
1443,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Some lab’ring seamen, heard his native tongue."
1444,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The sound, one moment, broke upon his pain"
1445,_THE PARTING HOUR._,With joyful force; he long’d to hear again;
1446,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Again he heard; he seized an offer’d hand,"
1447,_THE PARTING HOUR._,“And when beheld you last our native land?”
1448,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He cry’d, “and in what county? quickly say!”--          380"
1449,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"The seamen answer’d, strangers all were they;"
1450,_THE PARTING HOUR._,One only at his native port had been;
1451,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He, landing once, the quay and church had seen,"
1452,_THE PARTING HOUR._,For that esteem’d; but nothing more he knew.
1453,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Still more to know, would Allen join the crew,"
1454,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Sail where they sail’d; and, many a peril past,"
1455,_THE PARTING HOUR._,They at his kinsman’s isle their anchor cast;
1456,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But him they found not, nor could one relate"
1457,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Aught of his will, his wish, or his estate."
1458,_THE PARTING HOUR._,This grieved not Allen; then again he sail’d             390
1459,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"For England’s coast, again his fate prevail’d:"
1460,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"War raged, and he, an active man and strong,"
1461,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Was soon impress’d, and served his country long."
1462,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"By various shores he pass’d, on various seas,"
1463,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Never so happy as when void of ease.--
1464,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And then he told how, in a calm distress’d,"
1465,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Day after day his soul was sick of rest;
1466,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"When as a log upon the deep they stood,"
1467,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Then roved his spirit to the inland wood;
1468,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Till, while awake, he dream’d, that on the seas          400"
1469,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Were his loved home, the hill, the stream, the trees."
1470,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He gazed, he pointed to the scenes:--“There stand"
1471,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"My wife, my children, ’tis my lovely land;"
1472,_THE PARTING HOUR._,See! there my dwelling--oh! delicious scene
1473,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Of my best life--unhand me--are ye men?”
1474,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And thus the frenzy ruled him, till the wind"
1475,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Brush’d the fond pictures from the stagnant mind.
1476,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He told of bloody fights, and how at length"
1477,_THE PARTING HOUR._,The rage of battle gave his spirits strength.
1478,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"’Twas in the Indian seas his limb he lost,               410"
1479,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And he was left half-dead upon the coast;
1480,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But living gain’d, ’mid rich aspiring men,"
1481,_THE PARTING HOUR._,A fair subsistence by his ready pen.
1482,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"“Thus,” he continued, “pass’d unvaried years,"
1483,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Without events producing hopes or fears.”
1484,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Augmented pay procured him decent wealth,"
1485,_THE PARTING HOUR._,But years advancing undermined his health;
1486,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Then oft-times in delightful dream he flew
1487,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"To England’s shore, and scenes his childhood knew:"
1488,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He saw his parents, saw his fav’rite maid,               420"
1489,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"No feature wrinkled, not a charm decay’d;"
1490,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And, thus excited, in his bosom rose"
1491,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"A wish so strong, it baffled his repose;"
1492,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Anxious he felt on English earth to lie;
1493,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"To view his native soil, and there to die."
1494,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"He then described the gloom, the dread he found,"
1495,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"When first he landed on the chosen ground,"
1496,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Where undefined was all he hoped and fear’d,"
1497,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And how confused and troubled all appear’d;
1498,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"His thoughts in past and present scenes employ’d,        430"
1499,_THE PARTING HOUR._,All views in future blighted and destroy’d:
1500,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"His were a medley of bewild’ring themes,"
1501,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Sad as realities, and wild as dreams."
1502,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Here his relation closes, but his mind"
1503,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Flies back again, some resting-place to find;"
1504,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Thus silent, musing through the day, he sees"
1505,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"His children sporting by those lofty trees,"
1506,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Their mother singing in the shady scene,"
1507,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Where the fresh springs burst o’er the lively green;--
1508,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"So strong his eager fancy, he affrights                  440"
1509,_THE PARTING HOUR._,The faithful widow by its powerful flights;
1510,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"For what disturbs him he aloud will tell,"
1511,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And cry--“’Tis she, my wife! my Isabel!"
1512,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Where are my children?”--Judith grieves to hear
1513,_THE PARTING HOUR._,How the soul works in sorrows so severe;
1514,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Assiduous all his wishes to attend,"
1515,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Deprived of much, he yet may boast a friend;"
1516,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Watch’d by her care, in sleep, his spirit takes"
1517,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Its flight, and watchful finds her when he wakes."
1518,_THE PARTING HOUR._,’Tis now her office; her attention see!                450
1519,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"While her friend sleeps beneath that shading tree,"
1520,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Careful she guards him from the glowing heat,"
1521,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And pensive muses at her Allen’s feet.
1522,_THE PARTING HOUR._,And where is he? Ah! doubtless in those scenes
1523,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Of his best days, amid the vivid greens,"
1524,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Fresh with unnumber’d rills, where ev’ry gale"
1525,_THE PARTING HOUR._,Breathes the rich fragrance of the neighb’ring vale;
1526,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Smiles not his wife, and listens as there comes"
1527,_THE PARTING HOUR._,The night-bird’s music from the thickening glooms?
1528,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And as he sits with all these treasures nigh,     }     460"
1529,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Blaze not with fairy light the phosphor-fly,      }"
1530,_THE PARTING HOUR._,When like a sparkling gem it wheels illumined by? }
1531,_THE PARTING HOUR._,This is the joy that now so plainly speaks
1532,_THE PARTING HOUR._,In the warm transient flushing of his cheeks;
1533,_THE PARTING HOUR._,For he is list’ning to the fancied noise
1534,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Of his own children, eager in their joys:"
1535,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"All this he feels, a dream’s delusive bliss"
1536,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"Gives the expression, and the glow like this."
1537,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"And now his Judith lays her knitting by,"
1538,_THE PARTING HOUR._,These strong emotions in her friend to spy;              470
1539,_THE PARTING HOUR._,For she can fully of their nature deem----        }
1540,_THE PARTING HOUR._,"But see! he breaks the long-protracted theme,     }"

1578,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"They only knew, and they would not decide."
1579,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Far diff’rent he from that dull plodding tribe,"
1580,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Whom it was his amusement to describe;
1581,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Creatures no more enliven’d than a clod,"
1582,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But treading still as their dull fathers trod;
1583,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Who lived in times when not a man had seen
1584,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Corn sown by drill, or thresh’d by a machine:             10"
1585,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He was of those whose skill assigns the prize

1595,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who yearly finds his ample stores increase,"
1596,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,From fortune’s favours and a favouring lease;

1598,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who drinks his wine, and his disbursements scorns,"
1599,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who freely lives, and loves to show he can--"
1600,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"This is the farmer, made the gentleman."
1601,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The second species from the world is sent,"
1602,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Tired with its strife, or with his wealth content;"
1603,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In books and men beyond the former read,"
1604,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To farming solely by a passion led,                       30"

1615,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"His fortune known, and coming to retire,"
1616,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"If not a farmer, men had call’d him ’squire."
1617,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Forty and five his years, no child or wife"
1618,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Cross’d the still tenour of his chosen life;
1619,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Much land he purchased, planted far around,"
1620,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And let some portions of superfluous ground
1621,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To farmers near him, not displeased to say,"

1623,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Fix’d in his farm, he soon display’d his skill"
1624,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In small-boned lambs, the horse-hoe, and the drill;       50"
1625,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"From these he rose to themes of nobler kind,"
1626,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And show’d the riches of a fertile mind;
1627,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To all around their visits he repaid,"
1628,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And thus his mansion and himself display’d.
1629,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"His rooms were stately, rather fine than neat,"
1630,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And guests politely call’d his house a seat;
1631,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"At much expense was each apartment graced,"
1632,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"His taste was gorgeous, but it still was taste;"
1633,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In full festoons the crimson curtains fell,"
1634,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The sofas rose in bold elastic swell;                     60
1635,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Mirrors in gilded frames display’d the tints
1636,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Of glowing carpets and of colour’d prints;
1637,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The weary eye saw every object shine,"
1638,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And all was costly, fanciful, and fine."
1639,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"As with his friends he pass’d the social hours,"
1640,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,His generous spirit scorn’d to hide its powers;
1641,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Powers unexpected, for his eye and air"
1642,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Gave no sure signs that eloquence was there;
1643,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Oft he began with sudden fire and force,"
1644,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,As loth to lose occasion for discourse;                   70
1645,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Some, ’tis observed, who feel a wish to speak,"
1646,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Will a due place for introduction seek;
1647,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"On to their purpose step by step they steal,"
1648,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And all their way, by certain signals, feel;"

1652,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Of ending thoughtless--and of these was Gwyn.
1653,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And thus he spake:
1654,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,----“It grieves me to the soul
1655,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,To see how man submits to man’s control;                  80
1656,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,How overpower’d and shackled minds are led
1657,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In vulgar tracks, and to submission bred;"
1658,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The coward never on himself relies,"
1659,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But to an equal for assistance flies;
1660,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Man yields to custom as he bows to fate,"
1661,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In all things ruled--mind, body, and estate;"
1662,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In pain, in sickness, we for cure apply"
1663,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To them we know not, and we know not why;"
1664,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But that the creature has some jargon read,"
1665,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And got some Scotchman’s system in his head;              90
1666,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Some grave impostor, who will health insure,"
1667,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Long as your patience or your wealth endure;
1668,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But mark them well, the pale and sickly crew,"
1669,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"They have not health, and can they give it you?"
1670,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,These solemn cheats their various methods choose;
1671,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"A system fires them, as a bard his muse:"
1672,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Hence wordy wars arise; the learn’d divide,"
1673,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And groaning patients curse each erring guide.
1674,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“Next, our affairs are govern’d, buy or sell,"
1675,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Upon the deed the law must fix its spell;                100
1676,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Whether we hire or let, we must have still"
1677,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The dubious aid of an attorney’s skill;
1678,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"They take a part in every man’s affairs,"
1679,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And in all business some concern is theirs;
1680,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Because mankind in ways prescribed are found,"
1681,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Like flocks that follow on a beaten ground,"
1682,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Each abject nature in the way proceeds,"
1683,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"That now to shearing, now to slaughter leads."
1684,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“Should you offend, though meaning no offence,"
1685,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,You have no safety in your innocence;                    110
1686,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The statute broken then is placed in view,"
1687,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And men must pay for crimes they never knew.
1688,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who would by law regain his plunder’d store,"
1689,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Would pick up fallen merc’ry from the floor;
1690,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"If he pursue it, here and there it slides;"
1691,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He would collect it, but it more divides;"
1692,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"This part and this he stops, but still in vain,"
1693,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"It slips aside, and breaks in parts again;"
1694,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Till, after time and pains, and care and cost,"
1695,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He finds his labour and his object lost.                 120
1696,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“But most it grieves me, (friends alone are round,)"
1697,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,To see a man in priestly fetters bound;
1698,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Guides to the soul, these friends of Heaven contrive,"
1699,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Long as man lives, to keep his fears alive;"
1700,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Soon as an infant breathes, their rites begin;"
1701,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who knows not sinning, must be freed from sin;"
1702,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Who needs no bond must yet engage in vows;
1703,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who has no judgment, must a creed espouse:"
1704,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Advanced in life, our boys are bound by rules,  }"
1705,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Are catechised in churches, cloisters, schools, }       130"
1706,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And train’d in thraldom to be fit for tools;    }
1707,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The youth grown up, he now a partner needs,"
1708,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And lo! a priest, as soon as he succeeds."
1709,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,What man of sense can marriage-rites approve?
1710,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,What man of spirit can be bound to love?
1711,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Forced to be kind! compell’d to be sincere!
1712,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Do chains and fetters make companions dear?
1713,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Pris’ners indeed we bind; but though the bond
1714,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"May keep them safe, it does not make them fond:"
1715,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The ring, the vow, the witness, licence, prayers,        140"
1716,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,All parties known! made public all affairs!
1717,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Such forms men suffer, and from these they date"
1718,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,A deed of love begun with all they hate.
1719,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Absurd, that none the beaten road should shun,"
1720,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But love to do what other dupes have done!
1721,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“Well, now your priest has made you one of twain,"
1722,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Look you for rest? Alas! you look in vain.
1723,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"If sick, he comes; you cannot die in peace,"
1724,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Till he attends to witness your release;
1725,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To vex your soul, and urge you to confess                150"
1726,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The sins you feel, remember, or can guess;"
1727,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Nay, when departed, to your grave he goes,"
1728,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But there indeed he hurts not your repose.
1729,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“Such are our burthens; part we must sustain,"
1730,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But need not link new grievance to the chain.
1731,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Yet men like idiots will their frames surround
1732,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"With these vile shackles, nor confess they’re bound;"
1733,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In all that most confines them they confide,"
1734,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Their slavery boast, and make their bonds their pride;"
1735,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"E’en as the pressure galls them, they declare,           160"
1736,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,(Good souls!) how happy and how free they are!
1737,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"As madmen, pointing round their wretched cells,"
1738,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Cry, ‘Lo! the palace where our honour dwells.’"
1739,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,“Such is our state: but I resolve to live
1740,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,By rules my reason and my feelings give;
1741,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"No legal guards shall keep enthrall’d my mind,"
1742,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"No slaves command me, and no teachers blind."
1743,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“Tempted by sins, let me their strength defy,"
1744,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But have no second in a surplice by
1745,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"No bottle-holder, with officious aid,                    170"
1746,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To comfort conscience, weaken’d and afraid:"
1747,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Then if I yield, my frailty is not known;"
1748,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And, if I stand, the glory is my own."
1749,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“When Truth and Reason are our friends, we seem"
1750,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Alive! awake!--the superstitious dream.
1751,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“Oh! then, fair Truth, for thee alone I seek,"
1752,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Friend to the wise, supporter of the weak;"
1753,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,From thee we learn whate’er is right and just;
1754,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Forms to despise, professions to distrust;"
1755,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Creeds to reject, pretensions to deride,                 180"
1756,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And, following thee, to follow none beside.”"
1757,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Such was the speech; it struck upon the ear
1758,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Like sudden thunder, none expect to hear."
1759,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He saw men’s wonder with a manly pride,"
1760,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And gravely smiled at guest electrified;
1761,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“A farmer this!” they said, “Oh! let him seek"
1762,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,That place where he may for his country speak;
1763,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"On some great question to harangue for hours,"
1764,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"While speakers hearing, envy nobler powers!”"
1765,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Wisdom like this, as all things rich and rare,         190"
1766,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Must be acquired with pains, and kept with care;"
1767,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In books he sought it, which his friends might view,"
1768,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,When their kind host the guarding curtain drew.
1769,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"There were historic works for graver hours,"
1770,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And lighter verse, to spur the languid powers;"
1771,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"There metaphysics, logic there had place;"
1772,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But of devotion not a single trace--
1773,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Save what is taught in Gibbon’s florid page,"
1774,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And other guides of this inquiring age;
1775,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"There Hume appear’d, and, near, a splendid book          200"
1776,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Composed by Gay’s good Lord of Bolingbroke:
1777,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"With these were mix’d the light, the free, the vain,"
1778,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And from a corner peep’d the sage Tom Paine:
1779,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Here four neat volumes ‘Chesterfield’ were named,"
1780,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,For manners much and easy morals famed;
1781,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"With chaste Memoirs of Females, to be read"
1782,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,When deeper studies had confused the head.
1783,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Such his resources, treasures where he sought"
1784,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,For daily knowledge till his mind was fraught:
1785,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Then, when his friends were present, for their use       210"
1786,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He would the riches he had stored produce;
1787,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He found his lamp burn clearer, when each day"
1788,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He drew for all he purposed to display.
1789,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"For these occasions, forth his knowledge sprung,"
1790,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,As mustard quickens on a bed of dung;
1791,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"All was prepared, and guests allow’d the praise,"
1792,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,For what they saw he could so quickly raise.
1793,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Such this new friend; and, when the year came round,"
1794,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The same impressive, reasoning sage was found:"
1795,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Then, too, was seen the pleasant mansion graced          220"
1796,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,With a fair damsel--his no vulgar taste:
1797,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The neat Rebecca--sly, observant, still;"
1798,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Watching his eye, and waiting on his will;"
1799,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Simple yet smart her dress, her manners meek,"
1800,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Her smiles spoke for her, she would seldom speak;"
1801,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But watch’d each look, each meaning to detect,"
1802,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And (pleas’d with notice) felt for all neglect.
1803,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"With her lived Gwyn a sweet harmonious life,"
1804,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who, forms excepted, was a charming wife."
1805,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The wives indeed, so made by vulgar law,                 230"
1806,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Affected scorn, and censured what they saw;"
1807,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And what they saw not, fancied; said ’twas sin,"
1808,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And took no notice of the wife of Gwyn.
1809,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But he despised their rudeness, and would prove"
1810,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Theirs was compulsion and distrust, not love;"
1811,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,“Fools as they were! could they conceive that rings
1812,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And parsons’ blessings were substantial things?”
1813,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,They answer’d “Yes;” while he contemptuous spoke
1814,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Of the low notions held by simple folk;
1815,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Yet, strange that anger in a man so wise         }      240"
1816,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Should from the notions of these fools arise;    }
1817,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Can they so vex us, whom we so despise?          }"
1818,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Brave as he was, our hero felt a dread"
1819,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Lest those who saw him kind should think him led;
1820,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"If to his bosom fear a visit paid,"
1821,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"It was, lest he should be supposed afraid."
1822,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Hence sprang his orders; not that he desired
1823,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The things when done: obedience he required;
1824,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And thus, to prove his absolute command,"
1825,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Ruled every heart, and moved each subject hand;          250"
1826,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Assent he ask’d for every word and whim,"
1827,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,To prove that _he alone was king of him_.
1828,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The still Rebecca, who her station knew,"
1829,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,With ease resign’d the honours not her due;
1830,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Well pleased, she saw that men her board would grace,"
1831,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And wish’d not there to see a female face;
1832,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"When by her lover she his spouse was styled,"
1833,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Polite she thought it, and demurely smiled;"
1834,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But when he wanted wives and maidens round
1835,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"So to regard her, she grew grave, and frown’d;           260"
1836,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And sometimes whisper’d--“Why should you respect
1837,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"These people’s notions, yet their forms reject?”"
1838,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Gwyn, though from marriage bond and fetter free,"
1839,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Still felt abridgment in his liberty;
1840,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Something of hesitation he betray’d,"
1841,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And in her presence thought of what he said.
1842,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Thus fair Rebecca, though she walk’d astray,"
1843,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"His creed rejecting, judged it right to pray;"
1844,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To be at church, to sit with serious looks,"
1845,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,To read her Bible and her Sunday-books.                  270
1846,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"She hated all those new and daring themes,"
1847,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And call’d his free conjectures “devil’s dreams;”
1848,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"She honour’d still the priesthood in her fall,"
1849,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And claim’d respect and reverence for them all;
1850,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Call’d them “of sin’s destructive power the foes,"
1851,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And not such blockheads as he might suppose.”
1852,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Gwyn to his friends would smile, and sometimes say,"
1853,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“’Tis a kind fool, why vex her in her way?”"
1854,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Her way she took, and still had more in view,"
1855,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,For she contrived that he should take it too.            280
1856,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The daring freedom of his soul, ’twas plain,"
1857,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,In part was lost in a divided reign:
1858,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"A king and queen, who yet in prudence sway’d"
1859,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Their peaceful state, and were in turn obey’d."
1860,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Yet such our fate that, when we plan the best,"
1861,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Something arises to disturb our rest:
1862,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"For, though in spirits high, in body strong,"
1863,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Gwyn something felt--he knew not what--was wrong;
1864,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He wish’d to know, for he believed the thing,"
1865,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"If unremoved, would other evil bring:                    290"
1866,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"She must perceive, of late he could not eat,"
1867,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And when he walk’d, he trembled on his feet;"
1868,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He had forebodings, and he seem’d as one"
1869,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Stopp’d on the road, or threatened by a dun;"
1870,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He could not live, and yet, should he apply"
1871,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,To those physicians--he must sooner die.”
1872,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The mild Rebecca heard with some disdain,"
1873,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And some distress, her friend and lord complain:"
1874,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"His death she fear’d not, but had painful doubt"
1875,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,What his distemper’d nerves might bring about;           300
1876,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"With power like hers she dreaded an ally,"
1877,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And yet there was a person in her eye;--
1878,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"She thought, debated, fix’d--“Alas!” she said,"
1879,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,A case like yours must be no more delay’d.
1880,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,You hate these doctors; well! but were a friend
1881,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And doctor one, your fears would have an end."
1882,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,My cousin Mollet--Scotland holds him now--
1883,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Is above all men skilful, all allow:"
1884,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Of late a doctor, and within a while"
1885,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He means to settle in this favour’d isle;                310
1886,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Should he attend you, with his skill profound,"
1887,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"You must be safe, and shortly would be sound.”"
1888,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"When men in health against physicians rail,"
1889,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,They should consider that their nerves may fail;
1890,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who calls a lawyer rogue, may find, too late,"
1891,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,On one of these depends his whole estate;
1892,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Nay, when the world can nothing more produce,"
1893,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The priest, th’ insulted priest, may have his use."
1894,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Ease, health, and comfort, lift a man so high,"
1895,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,These powers are dwarfs that he can scarcely spy;        320
1896,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Pain, sickness, languor, keep a man so low,"
1897,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,That these neglected dwarfs to giants grow.
1898,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Happy is he who through the medium sees
1899,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Of clear good sense--but Gwyn was not of these.
1900,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He heard and he rejoiced: “Ah! let him come,"
1901,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And, till he fixes, make my house his home.”"
1902,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Home came the doctor--he was much admired;
1903,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He told the patient what his case required;
1904,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"His hours for sleep, his time to eat and drink;"
1905,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"When he should ride, read, rest, compose, or think.      330"
1906,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Thus join’d peculiar skill and art profound,"
1907,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,To make the fancy-sick no more than fancy-sound.
1908,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"With such attention, who could long be ill?"
1909,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Returning health proclaim’d the doctor’s skill.
1910,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Presents and praises from a grateful heart
1911,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Were freely offer’d on the patient’s part;
1912,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In high repute the doctor seem’d to stand,"
1913,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But still had got no footing in the land;
1914,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And, as he saw the seat was rich and fair,"
1915,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He felt disposed to fix his station there.               340
1916,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To gain his purpose, he perform’d the part"
1917,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Of a good actor, and prepared to start--"
1918,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Not like a traveller in a day serene,"
1919,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,When the sun shone and when the roads were clean;
1920,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Not like the pilgrim, when the morning gray,"
1921,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The ruddy eve succeeding, sends his way;"
1922,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But in a season when the sharp east wind
1923,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Had all its influence on a nervous mind.
1924,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"When past the parlour’s front it fiercely blew,     }"
1925,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And Gwyn sat pitying every bird that flew,          }   350"
1926,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,This strange physician said--“Adieu! adieu!         }
1927,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Farewell!--Heaven bless you!--if you should--but no,"
1928,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,You need not fear--farewell! ’tis time to go.”
1929,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The doctor spoke; and as the patient heard,"
1930,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,His old disorders (dreadful train!) appear’d;
1931,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He felt the tingling tremor, and the stress"
1932,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Upon his nerves that he could not express;
1933,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Should his good friend forsake him, he perhaps"
1934,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Might meet his death, and surely a relapse.”"
1935,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"So, as the doctor seem’d intent to part,               360"
1936,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He cried in terror--“Oh! be where thou art:
1937,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Come, thou art young, and unengaged; oh! come,"
1938,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Make me thy friend, give comfort to mine home;"
1939,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"I have now symptoms that require thine aid,"
1940,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Do, doctor, stay”--th’ obliging doctor stay’d."
1941,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Thus Gwyn was happy; he had now a friend,"
1942,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And a meek spouse on whom he could depend.
1943,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But now, possess’d of male and female guide,"
1944,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Divided power he thus must subdivide:
1945,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"In earlier days he rode, or sat at ease                  370"
1946,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Reclined, and having but himself to please;"
1947,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Now, if he would a fav’rite nag bestride,"
1948,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He sought permission--“Doctor, may I ride?”--"
1949,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"(Rebecca’s eye her sovereign pleasure told,)--"
1950,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“I think you may; but, guarded from the cold,"
1951,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Ride forty minutes.”--Free and happy soul!
1952,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He scorn’d submission, and a man’s control;"
1953,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But where such friends in every care unite
1954,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"All for his good, obedience is delight."
1955,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Now Gwyn, a sultan, bade affairs adieu,                380"
1956,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Led and assisted by the faithful two;
1957,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The favourite fair, Rebecca, near him sat,"
1958,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And whisper’d whom to love, assist, or hate;"
1959,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"While the chief vizier eased his lord of cares,"
1960,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And bore himself the burden of affairs.
1961,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"No dangers could from such alliance flow,"
1962,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,But from that law that changes all below.
1963,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"When wint’ry winds with leaves bestrew’d the ground,"
1964,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And men were coughing all the village round;
1965,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"When public papers of invasion told,                     390"
1966,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Diseases, famines, perils new and old;"
1967,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,When philosophic writers fail’d to clear
1968,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"The mind of gloom, and lighter works to cheer;"
1969,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Then came fresh terrors on our hero’s mind--
1970,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Fears unforeseen, and feelings undefined."
1971,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“In outward ills,” he cried, “I rest assured"
1972,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Of my friend’s aid; they will in time be cured:
1973,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But can his art subdue, resist, control"
1974,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,These inward griefs and troubles of the soul?
1975,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Oh! my Rebecca! my disorder’d mind                       400
1976,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"No help in study, none in thought can find;"
1977,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"What must I do, Rebecca?” She proposed"
1978,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The parish-guide; but what could be disclosed
1979,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To a proud priest?--“No! him have I defied,"
1980,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Insulted, slighted--shall he be my guide?"
1981,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But one there is, and if report be just,"
1982,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"A wise good man, whom I may safely trust;"
1983,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Who goes from house to house, from ear to ear,        }"
1984,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To make his truths, his Gospel truths, appear;        }"
1985,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"True if indeed they be, ’tis time that I should hear. }  410"
1986,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Send for that man; and if report be just,"
1987,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"I, like Cornelius, will the teacher trust;"
1988,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But, if deceiver, I the vile deceit"
1989,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Shall soon discover, and discharge the cheat.”"
1990,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To Doctor Mollet was the grief confess’d,"
1991,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,While Gwyn the freedom of his mind express’d;
1992,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Yet own’d it was to ills and errors prone,"
1993,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And he for guilt and frailty must atone.
1994,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“My books, perhaps,” the wav’ring mortal cried,"
1995,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,“Like men deceive--I would be satisfied;                 420
1996,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And to my soul the pious man may bring
1997,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Comfort and light--do let me try the thing.”
1998,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The cousins met; what pass’d with Gwyn was told;
1999,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,“Alas!” the doctor said; “how hard to hold
2000,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"These easy minds, where all impressions made"
2001,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"At first sink deeply, and then quickly fade;"
2002,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"For while so strong these new-born fancies reign,"
2003,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"We must divert them, to oppose is vain."
2004,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"You see him valiant now, he scorns to heed"
2005,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The bigot’s threat’nings or the zealot’s creed;          430
2006,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Shook by a dream, he next for truth receives"
2007,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"What frenzy teaches, and what fear believes;"
2008,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And this will place him in the power of one
2009,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Whom we must seek, because we cannot shun.”"
2010,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Wisp had been ostler at a busy inn,"
2011,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Where he beheld and grew in dread of sin;
2012,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Then to a Baptists’ meeting found his way,"
2013,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Became a convert, and was taught to pray;"
2014,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Then preach’d; and, being earnest and sincere,"
2015,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Brought other sinners to religious fear.                 440
2016,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Together grew his influence and his fame,"
2017,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Till our dejected hero heard his name;
2018,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"His little failings were a grain of pride,"
2019,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Raised by the numbers he presumed to guide:
2020,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"A love of presents, and of lofty praise"
2021,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,For his meek spirit and his humble ways;
2022,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But though this spirit would on flattery feed,"
2023,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,No praise could blind him and no arts mislead.
2024,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,To him the doctor made the wishes known
2025,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Of his good patron, but concealed his own;               450"
2026,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He of all teachers had distrust and doubt,"
2027,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And was reserved in what he came about;
2028,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Though on a plain and simple message sent,"
2029,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He had a secret and a bold intent.
2030,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Their minds at first were deeply veil’d; disguise
2031,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Form’d the slow speech, and op’d the eager eyes;"
2032,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Till by degrees sufficient light was thrown
2033,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"On every view, and all the business shown."
2034,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Wisp, as a skilful guide who led the blind,            }"
2035,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Had powers to rule and awe the vapourish mind,         } 460"
2036,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But not the changeful will, the wavering fear to bind; }"
2037,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And, should his conscience give him leave to dwell"
2038,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"With Gwyn, and every rival power expel,"
2039,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"(A dubious point,) yet he, with every care,"
2040,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Might soon the lot of the rejected share,"
2041,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And other Wisps be found like him to reign,"
2042,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And then be thrown upon the world again.
2043,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He thought it prudent, then, and felt it just,"
2044,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The present guides of his new friend to trust;
2045,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"True, he conceived, to touch the harder heart            470"
2046,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Of the cool doctor, was beyond his art;"
2047,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But mild Rebecca he could surely sway,"
2048,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,While Gwyn would follow where she led the way:
2049,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"So, to do good, (and why a duty shun,"
2050,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Because rewarded for the good when done?)
2051,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"He with his friends would join in all they plann’d,"
2052,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Save when his faith or feelings should withstand;
2053,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"There he must rest, sole judge of his affairs,"
2054,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,While they might rule exclusively in theirs.
2055,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"When Gwyn his message to the teacher sent,             480"
2056,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,He fear’d his friends would show their discontent;
2057,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And prudent seem’d it to th’ attendant pair,"
2058,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Not all at once to show an aspect fair.
2059,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"On Wisp they seem’d to look with jealous eye,"
2060,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And fair Rebecca was demure and shy;
2061,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"But by degrees the teacher’s worth they knew,"
2062,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And were so kind, they seem’d converted too."
2063,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Wisp took occasion to the nymph to say,"
2064,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,“You must be married: will you name the day?”
2065,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"She smiled,--“’Tis well; but, should he not comply,      490"
2066,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,Is it quite safe th’ experiment to try?”--
2067,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"“My child,” the teacher said, “who feels remorse,"
2068,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,(And feels not he?) must wish relief of course;
2069,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"And can he find it, while he fears the crime?--"
2070,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,You must be married; will you name the time?”
2071,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Glad was the patron as a man could be,                    }"
2072,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Yet marvell’d too, to find his guides agree;                }"
2073,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,“But what the cause?” he cried; “’tis genuine love for me.” }
2074,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"Each found his part, and let one act describe"
2075,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,The powers and honours of th’ accordant tribe:--        500
2076,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"A man for favour to the mansion speeds,"
2077,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,And cons his threefold task as he proceeds;
2078,_THE GENTLEMAN FARMER._,"To teacher Wisp he bows with humble air,"

2172,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Servant, and nurse, and comforter, and friend,"
2173,_PROCRASTINATION._,Dinah had still some duty to attend;
2174,_PROCRASTINATION._,"But yet their walk, when Rupert’s evening call"
2175,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Obtain’d an hour, made sweet amends for all;"
2176,_PROCRASTINATION._,"So long they now each other’s thoughts had known,"
2177,_PROCRASTINATION._,That nothing seem’d exclusively their own;
2178,_PROCRASTINATION._,"But with the common wish, the mutual fear,"
2179,_PROCRASTINATION._,They now had travell’d to their thirtieth year.
2180,_PROCRASTINATION._,"At length a prospect open’d--but, alas!"
2181,_PROCRASTINATION._,Long time must yet before the union pass;                 50

2186,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“You now are young, and for this brief delay,"
2187,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And Dinah’s care, what I bequeath will pay;"
2188,_PROCRASTINATION._,"All will be yours; nay, love, suppress that sigh;"
2189,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The kind must suffer, and the best must die.”"
2190,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Then came the cough, and strong the signs it gave"
2191,_PROCRASTINATION._,Of holding long contention with the grave.                60
2192,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The lovers parted with a gloomy view,"
2193,_PROCRASTINATION._,And little comfort but that both were true;
2194,_PROCRASTINATION._,"He for uncertain duties doom’d to steer,"
2195,_PROCRASTINATION._,While hers remained too certain and severe.
2196,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Letters arrived, and Rupert fairly told"
2197,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“His cares were many, and his hopes were cold;"
2198,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The view more clouded, that was never fair,"
2199,_PROCRASTINATION._,And love alone preserved him from despair.”
2200,_PROCRASTINATION._,"In other letters brighter hopes he drew,                  70"
2201,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“His friends were kind, and he believed them true.”"
2202,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When the sage widow Dinah’s grief descried,"
2203,_PROCRASTINATION._,She wonder’d much why one so happy sigh’d;
2204,_PROCRASTINATION._,Then bade her see how her poor aunt sustain’d
2205,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The ills of life, nor murmur’d nor complain’d."
2206,_PROCRASTINATION._,"To vary pleasures, from the lady’s chest"
2207,_PROCRASTINATION._,Were drawn the pearly string and tabby vest;
2208,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Beads, jewels, laces, all their value shown,"
2209,_PROCRASTINATION._,With the kind notice--“They will be your own.”
2210,_PROCRASTINATION._,"This hope, these comforts cherish’d day by day,         80"
2211,_PROCRASTINATION._,To Dinah’s bosom made a gradual way;
2212,_PROCRASTINATION._,Till love of treasure had as large a part
2213,_PROCRASTINATION._,As love of Rupert in the virgin’s heart.
2214,_PROCRASTINATION._,Whether it be that tender passions fail
2215,_PROCRASTINATION._,"From their own nature, while the strong prevail;"
2216,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Or whether av’rice, like the poison-tree[3],"
2217,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Kills all beside it, and alone will be:"
2218,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Whatever cause prevail’d, the pleasure grew"
2219,_PROCRASTINATION._,In Dinah’s soul--she loved the hoards to view;
2220,_PROCRASTINATION._,"With lively joy those comforts she survey’d,              90"
2221,_PROCRASTINATION._,And love grew languid in the careful maid.
2222,_PROCRASTINATION._,Now the grave niece partook the widow’s cares;
2223,_PROCRASTINATION._,Look’d to the great and ruled the small affairs;
2224,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Saw clean’d the plate, arranged the china show,"
2225,_PROCRASTINATION._,And felt her passion for a shilling grow.
2226,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Th’ indulgent aunt increased the maid’s delight,"
2227,_PROCRASTINATION._,By placing tokens of her wealth in sight;
2228,_PROCRASTINATION._,"She loved the value of her bonds to tell,"
2229,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And spake of stocks, and how they rose and fell."
2230,_PROCRASTINATION._,"This passion grew, and gain’d at length such sway,     100"
2231,_PROCRASTINATION._,That other passions shrank to make it way;
2232,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Romantic notions now the heart forsook,"
2233,_PROCRASTINATION._,"She read but seldom, and she changed her book;"
2234,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And for the verses she was wont to send,"
2235,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Short was her prose, and she was Rupert’s friend."
2236,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Seldom she wrote, and then the widow’s cough,"
2237,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And constant call, excused her breaking off;"
2238,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Who now, oppress’d, no longer took the air,"
2239,_PROCRASTINATION._,But sate and dozed upon an easy chair.
2240,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The cautious doctor saw the case was clear,              110"
2241,_PROCRASTINATION._,But judged it best to have companions near;
2242,_PROCRASTINATION._,"They came, they reason’d, they prescribed--at last,"
2243,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Like honest men, they said their hopes were past;"
2244,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Then came a priest--’tis comfort to reflect,"
2245,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When all is over, there was no neglect;"
2246,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And all was over--by her husband’s bones,"
2247,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The widow rests beneath the sculptured stones,"
2248,_PROCRASTINATION._,"That yet record their fondness and their fame,"
2249,_PROCRASTINATION._,While all they left the virgin’s care became:
2250,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Stock, bonds, and buildings;--it disturb’d her rest,     120"
2251,_PROCRASTINATION._,To think what load of troubles she possess’d.
2252,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Yet, if a trouble, she resolved to take"
2253,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Th’ important duty, for the donor’s sake;"
2254,_PROCRASTINATION._,"She too was heiress to the widow’s taste,"
2255,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Her love of hoarding, and her dread of waste."
2256,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Sometimes the past would on her mind intrude,"
2257,_PROCRASTINATION._,And then a conflict full of care ensued;
2258,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The thoughts of Rupert on her mind would press,"
2259,_PROCRASTINATION._,"His worth she knew, but doubted his success;"
2260,_PROCRASTINATION._,Of old she saw him heedless; what the boy                130
2261,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Forbore to save, the man would not enjoy;"
2262,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Oft had he lost the chance that care would seize,"
2263,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Willing to live, but more to live at ease;"
2264,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Yet could she not a broken vow defend,"
2265,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And Heav’n, perhaps, might yet enrich her friend."
2266,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Month after month was pass’d, and all were spent"
2267,_PROCRASTINATION._,In quiet comfort and in rich content:
2268,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Miseries there were, and woes the world around,"
2269,_PROCRASTINATION._,But these had not her pleasant dwelling found;
2270,_PROCRASTINATION._,"She knew that mothers grieved, and widows wept,          140"
2271,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And she was sorry, said her prayers, and slept."
2272,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Thus pass’d the seasons, and to Dinah’s board"
2273,_PROCRASTINATION._,Gave what the seasons to the rich afford;
2274,_PROCRASTINATION._,"For she indulged, nor was her heart so small,"
2275,_PROCRASTINATION._,That one strong passion should engross it all.
2276,_PROCRASTINATION._,"A love of splendour now with av’rice strove,"
2277,_PROCRASTINATION._,And oft appear’d to be the stronger love;
2278,_PROCRASTINATION._,"A secret pleasure fill’d the widow’s breast,"
2279,_PROCRASTINATION._,When she reflected on the hoards possess’d;
2280,_PROCRASTINATION._,"But livelier joy inspired th’ ambitious maid,            150"
2281,_PROCRASTINATION._,When she the purchase of those hoards display’d.
2282,_PROCRASTINATION._,In small but splendid room she loved to see
2283,_PROCRASTINATION._,That all was placed in view and harmony;
2284,_PROCRASTINATION._,"There, as with eager glance she look’d around,"
2285,_PROCRASTINATION._,She much delight in every object found;
2286,_PROCRASTINATION._,"While books devout were near her--to destroy,"
2287,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Should it arise, an overflow of joy."
2288,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Within that fair apartment, guests might see"
2289,_PROCRASTINATION._,The comforts cull’d for wealth by vanity.
2290,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Around the room an Indian paper blazed,                  160"
2291,_PROCRASTINATION._,With lively tint and figures boldly raised;
2292,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Silky and soft upon the floor below,"
2293,_PROCRASTINATION._,Th’ elastic carpet rose with crimson glow;
2294,_PROCRASTINATION._,All things around implied both cost and care;
2295,_PROCRASTINATION._,What met the eye was elegant or rare.
2296,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Some curious trifles round the room were laid,"
2297,_PROCRASTINATION._,By hope presented to the wealthy maid:
2298,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Within a costly case of varnish’d wood,"
2299,_PROCRASTINATION._,"In level rows, her polish’d volumes stood;"
2300,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Shown as a favour to a chosen few,                       170"
2301,_PROCRASTINATION._,To prove what beauty for a book could do;
2302,_PROCRASTINATION._,A silver urn with curious work was fraught;
2303,_PROCRASTINATION._,A silver lamp from Grecian pattern wrought;
2304,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Above her head, all gorgeous to behold,"
2305,_PROCRASTINATION._,A time-piece stood on feet of burnish’d gold;
2306,_PROCRASTINATION._,"A stag’s-head crest adorn’d the pictured case,"
2307,_PROCRASTINATION._,Through the pure crystal shone th’ enamell’d face;
2308,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And, while on brilliants moved the hands of steel,"
2309,_PROCRASTINATION._,"It click’d from pray’r to pray’r, from meal to meal."
2310,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Here as the lady sate, a friendly pair                 180"
2311,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Stept in t’ admire the view, and took their chair."
2312,_PROCRASTINATION._,They then related how the young and gay
2313,_PROCRASTINATION._,Were thoughtless wandering in the broad highway;
2314,_PROCRASTINATION._,"How tender damsels sail’d in tilted boats,"
2315,_PROCRASTINATION._,And laugh’d with wicked men in scarlet coats;
2316,_PROCRASTINATION._,And how we live in such degen’rate times
2317,_PROCRASTINATION._,"That men conceal their wants, and show their crimes;"
2318,_PROCRASTINATION._,"While vicious deeds are screen’d by fashion’s name,"
2319,_PROCRASTINATION._,And what was once our pride is now our shame.
2320,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Dinah was musing, as her friends discoursed,           190"
2321,_PROCRASTINATION._,When these last words a sudden entrance forced
2322,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Upon her mind, and what was once her pride"
2323,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And now her shame, some painful views supplied;"
2324,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Thoughts of the past within her bosom press’d,"
2325,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And there a change was felt, and was confess’d."
2326,_PROCRASTINATION._,"While thus the virgin strove with secret pain,"
2327,_PROCRASTINATION._,Her mind was wandering o’er the troubled main;
2328,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Still she was silent, nothing seem’d to see,"
2329,_PROCRASTINATION._,But sate and sigh’d in pensive reverie.
2330,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The friends prepared new subjects to begin,            200"
2331,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When tall Susannah, maiden starch, stalk’d in;"
2332,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Not in her ancient mode, sedate and slow,"
2333,_PROCRASTINATION._,"As when she came, the mind she knew to know;"
2334,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Nor as, when list’ning half an hour before,"
2335,_PROCRASTINATION._,She twice or thrice tapp’d gently at the door;
2336,_PROCRASTINATION._,"But, all decorum cast in wrath aside,"
2337,_PROCRASTINATION._,“I think the devil’s in the man!” she cried;
2338,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“A huge tall sailor, with his tawny cheek,"
2339,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And pitted face, will with my lady speak;"
2340,_PROCRASTINATION._,"He grinn’d an ugly smile, and said he knew,              210"
2341,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Please you, my lady, ’twould be joy to you;"
2342,_PROCRASTINATION._,What must I answer?”--Trembling and distress’d
2343,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Sank the pale Dinah, by her fears oppress’d;"
2344,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When thus alarm’d, and brooking no delay,"
2345,_PROCRASTINATION._,Swift to her room the stranger made his way.
2346,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“Revive, my love!” said he, “I’ve done thee harm,"
2347,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Give me thy pardon,” and he look’d alarm;"
2348,_PROCRASTINATION._,Meantime the prudent Dinah had contrived
2349,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Her soul to question, and she then revived."
2350,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“See! my good friend,” and then she raised her head, } 220"
2351,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“The bloom of life, the strength of youth is fled;     }"
2352,_PROCRASTINATION._,Living we die; to us the world is dead.                }
2353,_PROCRASTINATION._,"We parted bless’d with health, and I am now"
2354,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Age-struck and feeble, so I find art thou;"
2355,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Thine eye is sunken, furrow’d is thy face,"
2356,_PROCRASTINATION._,And downward look’st thou--so we run our race;
2357,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And happier they, whose race is nearly run,"
2358,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Their troubles over, and their duties done.”--"
2359,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“True, lady, true, we are not girl and boy;"
2360,_PROCRASTINATION._,But time has left us something to enjoy.”--              230
2361,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“What! thou hast learn’d my fortune?--yes, I live"
2362,_PROCRASTINATION._,To feel how poor the comforts wealth can give;
2363,_PROCRASTINATION._,Thou too perhaps art wealthy; but our fate
2364,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Still mocks our wishes, wealth is come too late.”--"
2365,_PROCRASTINATION._,“To me nor late nor early; I am come
2366,_PROCRASTINATION._,Poor as I left thee to my native home:
2367,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Nor yet,” said Rupert, “will I grieve; ’tis mine"
2368,_PROCRASTINATION._,"To share thy comforts, and the glory thine;"
2369,_PROCRASTINATION._,For thou wilt gladly take that generous part
2370,_PROCRASTINATION._,That both exalts and gratifies the heart;                240
2371,_PROCRASTINATION._,"While mine rejoices.”--“Heavens!” return’d the maid,"
2372,_PROCRASTINATION._,“This talk to one so wither’d and decayed?
2373,_PROCRASTINATION._,No! all my care is now to fit my mind
2374,_PROCRASTINATION._,"For other spousal, and to die resign’d."
2375,_PROCRASTINATION._,"As friend and neighbour, I shall hope to see"
2376,_PROCRASTINATION._,"These noble views, this pious love in thee;"
2377,_PROCRASTINATION._,"That we together may the change await,"
2378,_PROCRASTINATION._,Guides and spectators in each other’s fate;
2379,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When fellow-pilgrims, we shall daily crave"
2380,_PROCRASTINATION._,The mutual prayer that arms us for the grave.”           250
2381,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Half angry, half in doubt, the lover gazed"
2382,_PROCRASTINATION._,"On the meek maiden, by her speech amazed."
2383,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“Dinah,” said he, “dost thou respect thy vows?"
2384,_PROCRASTINATION._,What spousal mean’st thou?--thou art Rupert’s spouse;
2385,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The chance is mine to take, and thine to give;"
2386,_PROCRASTINATION._,"But trifling this, if we together live."
2387,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Can I believe, that, after all the past,"
2388,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Our vows, our loves, thou wilt be false at last?"
2389,_PROCRASTINATION._,Something thou hast--I know not what--in view;
2390,_PROCRASTINATION._,I find thee pious--let me find thee true.”--             260
2391,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“Ah! cruel this; but do, my friend, depart;"
2392,_PROCRASTINATION._,And to its feelings leave my wounded heart.”--
2393,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“Nay, speak at once; and, Dinah, let me know,"
2394,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Mean’st thou to take me, now I’m wreck’d, in tow?"
2395,_PROCRASTINATION._,Be fair; nor longer keep me in the dark;
2396,_PROCRASTINATION._,Am I forsaken for a trimmer spark?
2397,_PROCRASTINATION._,Heav’n’s spouse thou art not; nor can I believe
2398,_PROCRASTINATION._,That God accepts her who will man deceive.
2399,_PROCRASTINATION._,"True, I am shatter’d; I have service seen,"

2405,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Have been trepann’d, have lived in toil and care,"
2406,_PROCRASTINATION._,And wrought for wealth I was not doom’d to share;
2407,_PROCRASTINATION._,"It touch’d me deeply, for I felt a pride"
2408,_PROCRASTINATION._,In gaining riches for my destined bride.
2409,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Speak, then, my fate; for these my sorrows past,"
2410,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Time lost, youth fled, hope wearied, and at last         280"
2411,_PROCRASTINATION._,"This doubt of thee--a childish thing to tell,"
2412,_PROCRASTINATION._,But certain truth--my very throat they swell;
2413,_PROCRASTINATION._,"They stop the breath, and but for shame could I"
2414,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Give way to weakness, and with passion cry;"
2415,_PROCRASTINATION._,"These are unmanly struggles, but I feel"
2416,_PROCRASTINATION._,"This hour must end them, and perhaps will heal.”--"
2417,_PROCRASTINATION._,Here Dinah sigh’d as if afraid to speak--
2418,_PROCRASTINATION._,And then repeated--“They were frail and weak;
2419,_PROCRASTINATION._,"His soul she loved, and hoped he had the grace"
2420,_PROCRASTINATION._,To fix his thoughts upon a better place.”                290
2421,_PROCRASTINATION._,"She ceased;--with steady glance, as if to see"
2422,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The very root of this hypocrisy,"
2423,_PROCRASTINATION._,He her small fingers moulded in his hard
2424,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And bronzed broad hand; then told her, his regard,"
2425,_PROCRASTINATION._,"His best respect were gone, but love had still"
2426,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Hold in his heart, and govern’d yet the will--"
2427,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Or he would curse her;--saying this, he threw     }"
2428,_PROCRASTINATION._,"The hand in scorn away, and bade adieu            }"
2429,_PROCRASTINATION._,"To every lingering hope, with every care in view. }"
2430,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Proud and indignant, suffering, sick, and poor,        300"
2431,_PROCRASTINATION._,"He grieved unseen, and spoke of love no more--"
2432,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Till all he felt in indignation died,"
2433,_PROCRASTINATION._,As hers had sunk in avarice and pride.
2434,_PROCRASTINATION._,"In health declining, as in mind distress’d,"
2435,_PROCRASTINATION._,"To some in power his troubles he confess’d,"
2436,_PROCRASTINATION._,And shares a parish-gift;--at prayers he sees
2437,_PROCRASTINATION._,The pious Dinah dropp’d upon her knees;
2438,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Thence as she walks the street with stately air,"
2439,_PROCRASTINATION._,"As chance directs, oft meet the parted pair."
2440,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When he, with thickset coat of badge-man’s blue,         310"
2441,_PROCRASTINATION._,Moves near her shaded silk of changeful hue;
2442,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When his thin locks of grey approach her braid,"
2443,_PROCRASTINATION._,A costly purchase made in beauty’s aid;
2444,_PROCRASTINATION._,"When his frank air, and his unstudied pace,             }"
2445,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Are seen with her soft manner, air, and grace.          }"
2446,_PROCRASTINATION._,And his plain artless look with her sharp meaning face: }
2447,_PROCRASTINATION._,"It might some wonder in a stranger move,"
2448,_PROCRASTINATION._,How these together could have talk’d of love.
2449,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Behold them now!--see, there a tradesman stands,"
2450,_PROCRASTINATION._,And humbly hearkens to some fresh commands;              320
2451,_PROCRASTINATION._,"He moves to speak, she interrupts him--“Stay,”"
2452,_PROCRASTINATION._,Her air expresses--“Hark to what I say!”
2453,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Ten paces off, poor Rupert on a seat"
2454,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Has taken refuge from the noon-day heat,"
2455,_PROCRASTINATION._,"His eyes on her intent, as if to find"
2456,_PROCRASTINATION._,What were the movements of that subtle mind;
2457,_PROCRASTINATION._,How still! how earnest is he!--it appears
2458,_PROCRASTINATION._,His thoughts are wand’ring through his earlier years;
2459,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Through years of fruitless labour, to the day"
2460,_PROCRASTINATION._,When all his earthly prospects died away.                330
2461,_PROCRASTINATION._,"“Had I,” he thinks, “been wealthier of the two,          }"
2462,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Would she have found me so unkind, untrue?               }"
2463,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Or knows not man, when poor, what man when rich will do? }"
2464,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Yes, yes! I feel that I had faithful proved,"
2465,_PROCRASTINATION._,"And should have soothed and raised her, bless’d and loved.”"
2466,_PROCRASTINATION._,But Dinah moves--she had observed before
2467,_PROCRASTINATION._,The pensive Rupert at an humble door.
2468,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Some thoughts of pity raised by his distress,"
2469,_PROCRASTINATION._,Some feeling touch of ancient tenderness;
2470,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Religion, duty, urged the maid to speak                  340"
2471,_PROCRASTINATION._,In terms of kindness to a man so weak;
2472,_PROCRASTINATION._,"But pride forbad, and to return would prove"
2473,_PROCRASTINATION._,She felt the shame of his neglected love;
2474,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Nor wrapp’d in silence could she pass, afraid"
2475,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Each eye should see her, and each heart upbraid."
2476,_PROCRASTINATION._,"One way remain’d--the way the Levite took,"
2477,_PROCRASTINATION._,"Who without mercy could on misery look,"
2478,_PROCRASTINATION._,"(A way perceived by craft, approved by pride):"
2479,_PROCRASTINATION._,"She cross’d, and pass’d him on the other side."

2600,_THE PATRON._,"And oft, when wearied with more ardent flight,"
2601,_THE PATRON._,He felt a spur satiric song to write;
2602,_THE PATRON._,"A rival burgess his bold muse attack’d,"
2603,_THE PATRON._,And whipp’d severely for a well-known fact;
2604,_THE PATRON._,"For, while he seem’d to all demure and shy,"
2605,_THE PATRON._,Our poet gazed at what was passing by;                    90
2606,_THE PATRON._,"And ev’n his father smiled when playful wit,"
2607,_THE PATRON._,"From his young bard, some haughty object hit."
2608,_THE PATRON._,From ancient times the borough where they dwelt
2609,_THE PATRON._,Had mighty contest at elections felt.
2610,_THE PATRON._,"Sir Godfrey Ball, ’tis true, had held in pay"
2611,_THE PATRON._,Electors many for the trying day;
2612,_THE PATRON._,But in such golden chains to bind them all
2613,_THE PATRON._,Required too much for e’en Sir Godfrey Ball.
2614,_THE PATRON._,"A member died, and, to supply his place,"
2615,_THE PATRON._,Two heroes enter’d for th’ important race;               100
2616,_THE PATRON._,"Sir Godfrey’s friend and Earl Fitzdonnel’s son,"
2617,_THE PATRON._,"Lord Frederick Damer, both prepared to run;"
2618,_THE PATRON._,And partial numbers saw with vast delight
2619,_THE PATRON._,Their good young lord oppose the proud old knight.
2620,_THE PATRON._,"Our poet’s father, at a first request,"
2621,_THE PATRON._,"Gave the young lord his vote and interest,"
2622,_THE PATRON._,"And, what he could, our poet; for he stung"
2623,_THE PATRON._,"The foe by verse satiric, said and sung."
2624,_THE PATRON._,"Lord Frederick heard of all this youthful zeal,"
2625,_THE PATRON._,And felt as lords upon a canvass feel;                   110
2626,_THE PATRON._,"He read the satire, and he saw the use             }"
2627,_THE PATRON._,"That such cool insult, and such keen abuse,        }"
2628,_THE PATRON._,Might on the wavering minds of voting men produce; }
2629,_THE PATRON._,"Then, too, his praises were in contrast seen,"
2630,_THE PATRON._,“A lord as noble as the knight was mean.”
2631,_THE PATRON._,"“I much rejoice,” he cried, “such worth to find;"
2632,_THE PATRON._,To this the world must be no longer blind;
2633,_THE PATRON._,"His glory will descend from sire to son,"

2635,_THE PATRON._,"Our poet’s mind, now hurried and elate,                  120"
2636,_THE PATRON._,Alarm’d the anxious parent for his fate;
2637,_THE PATRON._,"Who saw with sorrow, should their friend succeed,"
2638,_THE PATRON._,That much discretion would the poet need.
2639,_THE PATRON._,"Their friend succeeded, and repaid the zeal"
2640,_THE PATRON._,"The poet felt, and made opposers feel,"
2641,_THE PATRON._,By praise (from lords how soothing and how sweet!)
2642,_THE PATRON._,And invitation to his noble seat.
2643,_THE PATRON._,"The father ponder’d, doubtful if the brain"
2644,_THE PATRON._,Of his proud boy such honour could sustain;
2645,_THE PATRON._,"Pleased with the favours offer’d to a son,               130"
2646,_THE PATRON._,But seeing dangers few so ardent shun.
2647,_THE PATRON._,"Thus, when they parted, to the youthful breast"
2648,_THE PATRON._,The father’s fears were by his love impress’d:
2649,_THE PATRON._,"“There you will find, my son, the courteous ease"
2650,_THE PATRON._,That must subdue the soul it means to please;
2651,_THE PATRON._,That soft attention which ev’n beauty pays
2652,_THE PATRON._,"To wake our passions, or provoke our praise;"
2653,_THE PATRON._,"There all the eye beholds will give delight,"
2654,_THE PATRON._,Where every sense is flatter’d like the sight.
2655,_THE PATRON._,This is your peril; can you from such scene              140
2656,_THE PATRON._,"Of splendour part, and feel your mind serene,"
2657,_THE PATRON._,And in the father’s humble state resume
2658,_THE PATRON._,The frugal diet and the narrow room?”
2659,_THE PATRON._,"To this the youth with cheerful heart replied,"
2660,_THE PATRON._,"Pleased with the trial, but as yet untried;"
2661,_THE PATRON._,"And while professing patience, should he fail,"
2662,_THE PATRON._,He suffer’d hope o’er reason to prevail.
2663,_THE PATRON._,"Impatient, by the morning mail convey’d,"
2664,_THE PATRON._,The happy guest his promised visit paid;
2665,_THE PATRON._,"And now, arriving at the hall, he tried                  150"
2666,_THE PATRON._,"For air composed, serene and satisfied;"
2667,_THE PATRON._,"As he had practised in his room alone,"
2668,_THE PATRON._,And there acquired a free and easy tone.
2669,_THE PATRON._,"There he had said, “Whatever the degree"
2670,_THE PATRON._,"A man obtains, what more than man is he?”"
2671,_THE PATRON._,And when arrived--“This room is but a room;
2672,_THE PATRON._,Can aught we see the steady soul o’ercome?
2673,_THE PATRON._,"Let me in all a manly firmness show,"
2674,_THE PATRON._,"Upheld by talents, and their value know.”"
2675,_THE PATRON._,This reason urged; but it surpass’d his skill          160
2676,_THE PATRON._,To be in act as manly as in will:
2677,_THE PATRON._,"When he his lordship and the lady saw,"
2678,_THE PATRON._,"Brave as he was, he felt oppress’d with awe;"
2679,_THE PATRON._,"And spite of verse, that so much praise had won,"
2680,_THE PATRON._,The poet found he was the bailiff’s son.
2681,_THE PATRON._,"But dinner came, and the succeeding hours"
2682,_THE PATRON._,"Fix’d his weak nerves, and raised his failing powers;"
2683,_THE PATRON._,"Praised and assured, he ventured once or twice"
2684,_THE PATRON._,"On some remark, and bravely broke the ice;"
2685,_THE PATRON._,"So that at night, reflecting on his words,               170"
2686,_THE PATRON._,"He found in time, he might converse with lords."
2687,_THE PATRON._,Now was the sister of his patron seen--
2688,_THE PATRON._,"A lovely creature, with majestic mien;"
2689,_THE PATRON._,"Who, softly smiling while she look’d so fair,"
2690,_THE PATRON._,Praised the young poet with such friendly air;
2691,_THE PATRON._,"Such winning frankness in her looks express’d,"
2692,_THE PATRON._,"And such attention to her brother’s guest,"
2693,_THE PATRON._,"That so much beauty, join’d with speech so kind,"
2694,_THE PATRON._,Raised strong emotions in the poet’s mind;
2695,_THE PATRON._,Till reason fail’d his bosom to defend                   180
2696,_THE PATRON._,From the sweet power of this enchanting friend.--
2697,_THE PATRON._,Rash boy! what hope thy frantic mind invades?
2698,_THE PATRON._,"What love confuses, and what pride persuades?"
2699,_THE PATRON._,Awake to truth! shouldst thou deluded feed
2700,_THE PATRON._,"On hopes so groundless, thou art mad indeed."
2701,_THE PATRON._,"What say’st thou, wise-one? “that all-powerful love"
2702,_THE PATRON._,Can fortune’s strong impediments remove;
2703,_THE PATRON._,"Nor is it strange that worth should wed to worth,"
2704,_THE PATRON._,The pride of genius with the pride of birth.”
2705,_THE PATRON._,"While thou art dreaming thus, the beauty spies           190"
2706,_THE PATRON._,"Love in thy tremor, passion in thine eyes;"
2707,_THE PATRON._,"And, with th’ amusement pleased, of conquest vain,"
2708,_THE PATRON._,"She seeks her pleasure, careless of thy pain;"
2709,_THE PATRON._,"She gives thee praise to humble and confound,"
2710,_THE PATRON._,"Smiles to ensnare, and flatters thee to wound."
2711,_THE PATRON._,Why has she said that in the lowest state
2712,_THE PATRON._,The noble mind insures a noble fate?
2713,_THE PATRON._,And why thy daring mind to glory call?
2714,_THE PATRON._,"That thou may’st dare and suffer, soar and fall."

2717,_THE PATRON._,"Their victim’s anguish gives their charms applause,"
2718,_THE PATRON._,And their chief glory is the woe they cause.
2719,_THE PATRON._,"Something of this was felt, in spite of love,"
2720,_THE PATRON._,"Which hope, in spite of reason, would remove."
2721,_THE PATRON._,"Thus lived our youth, with conversation, books,"
2722,_THE PATRON._,And Lady Emma’s soul-subduing looks;

2726,_THE PATRON._,"’Twas autumn yet, and many a day must frown"
2727,_THE PATRON._,"On Brandon-Hall, ere went my lord to town;"
2728,_THE PATRON._,"Meantime the father, who had heard his boy"
2729,_THE PATRON._,"Lived in a round of luxury and joy,"
2730,_THE PATRON._,"And, justly thinking that the youth was one"
2731,_THE PATRON._,"Who, meeting danger, was unskill’d to shun;"
2732,_THE PATRON._,"Knowing his temper, virtue, spirit, zeal,"
2733,_THE PATRON._,"How prone to hope and trust, believe and feel:"
2734,_THE PATRON._,"These on the parent’s soul their weight impress’d,"
2735,_THE PATRON._,And thus he wrote the counsels of his breast.            220
2736,_THE PATRON._,"“John, thou’rt a genius; thou hast some pretence,"
2737,_THE PATRON._,"I think, to wit, but hast thou sterling sense?"
2738,_THE PATRON._,"That which, like gold, may through the world go forth,"
2739,_THE PATRON._,And always pass for what ’tis truly worth?
2740,_THE PATRON._,"Whereas this genius, like a bill, must take"
2741,_THE PATRON._,Only the value our opinions make.
2742,_THE PATRON._,"“Men famed for wit, of dangerous talents vain,"
2743,_THE PATRON._,Treat those of common parts with proud disdain;
2744,_THE PATRON._,"The powers that wisdom would, improving, hide,"
2745,_THE PATRON._,They blaze abroad with inconsid’rate pride;              230
2746,_THE PATRON._,"While yet but mere probationers for fame,"
2747,_THE PATRON._,They seize the honour they should then disclaim:
2748,_THE PATRON._,Honour so hurried to the light must fade;
2749,_THE PATRON._,The lasting laurels flourish in the shade.
2750,_THE PATRON._,“Genius is jealous; I have heard of some

2752,_THE PATRON._,"Nay, different talents would their envy raise;"
2753,_THE PATRON._,Poets have sicken’d at a dancer’s praise;
2754,_THE PATRON._,"And one, the happiest writer of his time,"
2755,_THE PATRON._,Grew pale at hearing Reynolds was sublime;               240
2756,_THE PATRON._,That Rutland’s duchess wore a heavenly smile--
2757,_THE PATRON._,"And I, said he, neglected all the while!"
2758,_THE PATRON._,"“A waspish tribe are these, on gilded wings,"
2759,_THE PATRON._,"Humming their lays, and brandishing their stings;"
2760,_THE PATRON._,"And thus they move their friends and foes among,"
2761,_THE PATRON._,Prepared for soothing or satiric song.
2762,_THE PATRON._,"“Hear me, my boy; thou hast a virtuous mind--"
2763,_THE PATRON._,But be thy virtues of the sober kind;
2764,_THE PATRON._,"Be not a Quixote, ever up in arms"

2766,_THE PATRON._,"If never heeded, thy attack is vain;"
2767,_THE PATRON._,"And if they heed thee, they’ll attack again;"
2768,_THE PATRON._,"Then, too, in striking at that heedless rate,"
2769,_THE PATRON._,Thou in an instant may’st decide thy fate.
2770,_THE PATRON._,“Leave admonition--let the vicar give

2774,_THE PATRON._,"“Our Pope, they say, once entertain’d the whim,"
2775,_THE PATRON._,Who fear’d not God should be afraid of him;              260
2776,_THE PATRON._,"But grant they fear’d him, was it further said,"
2777,_THE PATRON._,That he reform’d the hearts he made afraid?

2779,_THE PATRON._,"Of flagrant felons, with his floggings sore?"
2780,_THE PATRON._,"Was Cibber silenced? No; with vigour bless’d,"
2781,_THE PATRON._,"And brazen front, half earnest, half in jest,"
2782,_THE PATRON._,"He dared the bard to battle, and was seen"
2783,_THE PATRON._,In all his glory match’d with Pope and spleen;
2784,_THE PATRON._,"Himself he stripp’d, the harder blow to hit,"
2785,_THE PATRON._,Then boldly match’d his ribaldry with wit;               270
2786,_THE PATRON._,"The poet’s conquest Truth and Time proclaim,"
2787,_THE PATRON._,But yet the battle hurt his peace and fame.

2789,_THE PATRON._,"And rather pleased thyself, than bent to please:"
2790,_THE PATRON._,"Upon thy lord with decent care attend,"

2794,_THE PATRON._,"Talents like thine may make a man approved,"

2796,_THE PATRON._,"Look round, my son, and thou wilt early see"
2797,_THE PATRON._,The kind of man thou art not form’d to be.
2798,_THE PATRON._,“The real favourites of the great are they

2809,_THE PATRON._,Objects for one whom nothing can amuse!
2810,_THE PATRON._,"For ere those objects can the soul delight,"
2811,_THE PATRON._,They must to joy the soul herself excite;

2817,_THE PATRON._,And let the spark awake the lingering fire;

2861,_THE PATRON._,They take not in the music of the spheres;
2862,_THE PATRON._,"They must not feel the warble and the thrill,"

2874,_THE PATRON._,"Dost thou from me derive this taste sublime,"
2875,_THE PATRON._,Who order port the dozen at a time;                      360
2876,_THE PATRON._,When (every glass held precious in our eyes)

2912,_THE PATRON._,And then exclaim--‘How long must merit stay;’
2913,_THE PATRON._,"Then show how high thy modest hopes may stretch,"
2914,_THE PATRON._,And point to stations far beyond thy reach:
2915,_THE PATRON._,"Let such designer, by thy conduct, see                   400"

2922,_THE PATRON._,"If foes beset thee, if thy spirits fail--"
2923,_THE PATRON._,"No more of winds or waters be the sport,"
2924,_THE PATRON._,But in thy father’s mansion find a port.”
2925,_THE PATRON._,"Our poet read.--“It is, in truth,” said he,            410"
2926,_THE PATRON._,"“Correct in part, but what is _this_ to me?"
2927,_THE PATRON._,I love a foolish Abigail! in base
2928,_THE PATRON._,And sordid office! fear not such disgrace:

2931,_THE PATRON._,“The cases differ.”--“True! for what surprise

2935,_THE PATRON._,"John saw not this; and many a week had pass’d,         420"
2936,_THE PATRON._,While the vain beauty held her victim fast;
2937,_THE PATRON._,"The noble friend still condescension show’d,"
2938,_THE PATRON._,"And, as before, with praises overflow’d;"
2939,_THE PATRON._,But his grave lady took a silent view
2940,_THE PATRON._,"Of all that pass’d, and, smiling, pitied too."
2941,_THE PATRON._,Cold grew the foggy morn; the day was brief;
2942,_THE PATRON._,Loose on the cherry hung the crimson leaf;
2943,_THE PATRON._,The dew dwelt ever on the herb; the woods
2944,_THE PATRON._,"Roar’d with strong blasts, with mighty showers the floods;"
2945,_THE PATRON._,"All green was vanish’d, save of pine and yew,            430"
2946,_THE PATRON._,That still display’d their melancholy hue;
2947,_THE PATRON._,"Save the green holly with its berries red,"
2948,_THE PATRON._,And the green moss that o’er the gravel spread.
2949,_THE PATRON._,To public views my lord must soon attend;
2950,_THE PATRON._,And soon the ladies--would they leave their friend?
2951,_THE PATRON._,"The time was fix’d--approach’d--was near--was come,"
2952,_THE PATRON._,The trying time that fill’d his soul with gloom.
2953,_THE PATRON._,"Thoughtful our poet in the morning rose,"
2954,_THE PATRON._,"And cried, “One hour my fortune will disclose;"
2955,_THE PATRON._,Terrific hour! from thee have I to date                  440
2956,_THE PATRON._,"Life’s loftier views, or my degraded state;"
2957,_THE PATRON._,For now to be what I have been before
2958,_THE PATRON._,"Is so to fall, that I can rise no more.”"
2959,_THE PATRON._,"The morning meal was past, and all around"
2960,_THE PATRON._,The mansion rang with each discordant sound;
2961,_THE PATRON._,"Haste was in every foot, and every look"
2962,_THE PATRON._,The trav’ller’s joy for London-journey spoke.
2963,_THE PATRON._,"Not so our youth; whose feelings, at the noise"
2964,_THE PATRON._,"Of preparation, had no touch of joys;"
2965,_THE PATRON._,"He pensive stood, and saw each carriage drawn,           450"
2966,_THE PATRON._,"With lackeys mounted, ready on the lawn."
2967,_THE PATRON._,The ladies came; and John in terror threw
2968,_THE PATRON._,"One painful glance, and then his eyes withdrew;"
2969,_THE PATRON._,"Not with such speed, but he in other eyes"
2970,_THE PATRON._,With anguish read--“I pity but despise--
2971,_THE PATRON._,Unhappy boy! presumptuous scribbler!--you
2972,_THE PATRON._,"To dream such dreams!--be sober, and adieu!”"
2973,_THE PATRON._,Then came the noble friend--“And will my lord
2974,_THE PATRON._,Vouchsafe no comfort? drop no soothing word?
2975,_THE PATRON._,"Yes, he must speak:” he speaks, “My good young friend,--"
2976,_THE PATRON._,You know my views; upon my care depend;                  461
2977,_THE PATRON._,"My hearty thanks to your good father pay,"
2978,_THE PATRON._,"And be a student.--Harry, drive away.”"
2979,_THE PATRON._,"Stillness reign’d all around; of late so full,"
2980,_THE PATRON._,The busy scene deserted now and dull.
2981,_THE PATRON._,Stern is his nature who forbears to feel
2982,_THE PATRON._,Gloom o’er his spirits on such trials steal;
2983,_THE PATRON._,Most keenly felt our poet as he went
2984,_THE PATRON._,From room to room without a fix’d intent;
2985,_THE PATRON._,"“And here,” he thought, “I was caress’d; admired         470"
2986,_THE PATRON._,"Were here my songs; she smiled, and I aspired:"
2987,_THE PATRON._,"The change how grievous!” As he mused, a dame"
2988,_THE PATRON._,Busy and peevish to her duties came;
2989,_THE PATRON._,"Aside the tables and the chairs she drew,"
2990,_THE PATRON._,And sang and mutter’d in the poet’s view:--
2991,_THE PATRON._,“This was her fortune; here they leave the poor;
2992,_THE PATRON._,"Enjoy themselves, and think of us no more;"
2993,_THE PATRON._,I had a promise--” here his pride and shame
2994,_THE PATRON._,Urged him to fly from this familiar dame;
2995,_THE PATRON._,"He gave one farewell look, and by a coach                480"
2996,_THE PATRON._,Reach’d his own mansion at the night’s approach.
2997,_THE PATRON._,"His father met him with an anxious air,"
2998,_THE PATRON._,"Heard his sad tale, and check’d what seem’d despair;"
2999,_THE PATRON._,"Hope was in him corrected, but alive;"
3000,_THE PATRON._,My lord would something for a friend contrive;
3001,_THE PATRON._,His word was pledged; our hero’s feverish mind
3002,_THE PATRON._,"Admitted this, and half his grief resign’d."
3003,_THE PATRON._,"But when three months had fled, and every day"
3004,_THE PATRON._,"Drew from the sickening hopes their strength away,"
3005,_THE PATRON._,"The youth became abstracted, pensive, dull;              490"
3006,_THE PATRON._,"He utter’d nothing, though his heart was full."
3007,_THE PATRON._,"Teased by inquiring words and anxious looks,"
3008,_THE PATRON._,"And all forgetful of his muse and books,"
3009,_THE PATRON._,"Awake he mourn’d, but in his sleep perceived"
3010,_THE PATRON._,A lovely vision that his pain relieved;
3011,_THE PATRON._,"His soul transported, hail’d the happy seat,"
3012,_THE PATRON._,Where once his pleasure was so pure and sweet;
3013,_THE PATRON._,"Where joys departed came in blissful view,"
3014,_THE PATRON._,"Till reason wak’d, and not a joy he knew."
3015,_THE PATRON._,"Questions now vex’d his spirit, most from those        500"
3016,_THE PATRON._,"Who are called friends, because they are not foes."
3017,_THE PATRON._,"“John!” they would say; he, starting, turn’d around;"
3018,_THE PATRON._,“John!” there was something shocking in the sound;
3019,_THE PATRON._,"Ill brook’d he then the pert familiar phrase,"
3020,_THE PATRON._,"The untaught freedom, and th’ inquiring gaze;"
3021,_THE PATRON._,"Much was his temper touch’d, his spleen provoked,"
3022,_THE PATRON._,"When ask’d how ladies talk’d, or walk’d, or look’d?"
3023,_THE PATRON._,What said my lord of politics? how spent
3024,_THE PATRON._,He there his time? and was he glad he went?”
3025,_THE PATRON._,"At length a letter came, both cool and brief,          510"
3026,_THE PATRON._,But still it gave the burthen’d heart relief:
3027,_THE PATRON._,"Though not inspired by lofty hopes, the youth"
3028,_THE PATRON._,Placed much reliance on Lord Frederick’s truth;
3029,_THE PATRON._,"Summon’d to town, he thought the visit one"
3030,_THE PATRON._,Where something fair and friendly would be done;
3031,_THE PATRON._,"Although he judged not, as before his fall,"
3032,_THE PATRON._,When all was love and promise at the hall.
3033,_THE PATRON._,"Arrived in town, he early sought to know"
3034,_THE PATRON._,The fate such dubious friendship would bestow;
3035,_THE PATRON._,"At a tall building, trembling, he appear’d,              520"
3036,_THE PATRON._,And his low rap was indistinctly heard;
3037,_THE PATRON._,"A well-known servant came--“A while,” said he,"
3038,_THE PATRON._,“Be pleased to wait; my lord has company.”
3039,_THE PATRON._,"Alone our hero sate; the news in hand,"
3040,_THE PATRON._,"Which, though he read, he could not understand."
3041,_THE PATRON._,Cold was the day; in days so cold as these
3042,_THE PATRON._,"There needs a fire, where minds and bodies freeze;"
3043,_THE PATRON._,"The vast and echoing room, the polish’d grate,"
3044,_THE PATRON._,"The crimson chairs, the sideboard with its plate;"
3045,_THE PATRON._,"The splendid sofa, which, though made for rest,          530"
3046,_THE PATRON._,He then had thought it freedom to have press’d;
3047,_THE PATRON._,"The shining tables, curiously inlaid,"
3048,_THE PATRON._,Were all in comfortless proud style display’d;
3049,_THE PATRON._,"And to the troubled feelings terror gave,"
3050,_THE PATRON._,That made the once-dear friend the sick’ning slave.
3051,_THE PATRON._,“Was he forgotten?” Thrice upon his ear
3052,_THE PATRON._,"Struck the loud clock, yet no relief was near;"
3053,_THE PATRON._,"Each rattling carriage, and each thundering stroke"
3054,_THE PATRON._,"On the loud door, the dream of fancy broke;"
3055,_THE PATRON._,"Oft as a servant chanced the way to come,                540"
3056,_THE PATRON._,“Brings he a message?” no! he pass’d the room.
3057,_THE PATRON._,At length ’tis certain; “Sir you will attend
3058,_THE PATRON._,At twelve on Thursday!” Thus the day had end.
3059,_THE PATRON._,"Vex’d by these tedious hours of needless pain,"
3060,_THE PATRON._,John left the noble mansion with disdain;
3061,_THE PATRON._,"For there was something in that still, cold place,"
3062,_THE PATRON._,That seem’d to threaten and portend disgrace.
3063,_THE PATRON._,Punctual again the modest rap declared
3064,_THE PATRON._,The youth attended; then was all prepared:
3065,_THE PATRON._,"For the same servant, by his lord’s command,             550"
3066,_THE PATRON._,A paper offer’d to his trembling hand.
3067,_THE PATRON._,“No more!” he cried; “disdains he to afford
3068,_THE PATRON._,"One kind expression, one consoling word?”"
3069,_THE PATRON._,With troubled spirit he began to read
3070,_THE PATRON._,That “In the church my lord could not succeed;”
3071,_THE PATRON._,"Who had “to peers of either kind applied,"
3072,_THE PATRON._,And was with dignity and grace denied;
3073,_THE PATRON._,"While his own livings were by men possess’d,"
3074,_THE PATRON._,Not likely in their chancels yet to rest;
3075,_THE PATRON._,"And therefore, all things weigh’d (as he, my lord,       560"
3076,_THE PATRON._,"Had done maturely, and he pledged his word),"
3077,_THE PATRON._,Wisdom it seem’d for John to turn his view
3078,_THE PATRON._,"To busier scenes, and bid the church adieu!”"
3079,_THE PATRON._,Here grieved the youth; he felt his father’s pride
3080,_THE PATRON._,Must with his own be shock’d and mortified;
3081,_THE PATRON._,But when he found his future comforts placed
3082,_THE PATRON._,"Where he, alas! conceived himself disgraced--"
3083,_THE PATRON._,"In some appointment on the London quays,"
3084,_THE PATRON._,He bade farewell to honour and to ease;
3085,_THE PATRON._,"His spirit fell; and, from that hour assured             570"
3086,_THE PATRON._,"How vain his dreams, he suffer’d and was cured."
3087,_THE PATRON._,"Our poet hurried on, with wish to fly"
3088,_THE PATRON._,"From all mankind, to be conceal’d, and die."
3089,_THE PATRON._,"Alas! what hopes, what high romantic views                      }"
3090,_THE PATRON._,"Did that one visit to the soul infuse,                          }"
3091,_THE PATRON._,"Which cherish’d with such love, ’twas worse than death to lose! }"
3092,_THE PATRON._,"Still he would strive, though painful was the strife,"
3093,_THE PATRON._,To walk in this appointed road of life;
3094,_THE PATRON._,"On these low duties duteous he would wait,"
3095,_THE PATRON._,And patient bear the anguish of his fate.                580
3096,_THE PATRON._,"Thanks to the patron, but of coldest kind,"
3097,_THE PATRON._,Express’d the sadness of the poet’s mind;
3098,_THE PATRON._,"Whose heavy hours were pass’d with busy men,"
3099,_THE PATRON._,In the dull practice of th’ official pen;
3100,_THE PATRON._,Who to superiors must in time impart
3101,_THE PATRON._,(The custom this) his progress in their art.
3102,_THE PATRON._,"But so had grief on his perception wrought,"
3103,_THE PATRON._,That all unheeded were the duties taught;
3104,_THE PATRON._,"No answers gave he when his trial came,"
3105,_THE PATRON._,"Silent he stood, but suffering without shame;            590"
3106,_THE PATRON._,And they observed that words severe or kind
3107,_THE PATRON._,Made no impression on his wounded mind;
3108,_THE PATRON._,For all perceived from whence his failure rose--
3109,_THE PATRON._,Some grief whose cause he deign’d not to disclose.
3110,_THE PATRON._,A soul averse from scenes and works so new;
3111,_THE PATRON._,"Fear, ever shrinking from the vulgar crew;"
3112,_THE PATRON._,"Distaste for each mechanic law and rule,"
3113,_THE PATRON._,Thoughts of past honour and a patron cool;
3114,_THE PATRON._,"A grieving parent, and a feeling mind,"
3115,_THE PATRON._,"Timid and ardent, tender and refined:                    600"
3116,_THE PATRON._,"These all with mighty force the youth assail’d,"
3117,_THE PATRON._,"Till his soul fainted, and his reason fail’d."
3118,_THE PATRON._,"When this was known, and some debate arose"
3119,_THE PATRON._,"How they who saw it should the fact disclose,"
3120,_THE PATRON._,"He found their purpose, and in terror fled"
3121,_THE PATRON._,"From unseen kindness, with mistaken dread."
3122,_THE PATRON._,Meantime the parent was distress’d to find
3123,_THE PATRON._,His son no longer for a priest design’d;
3124,_THE PATRON._,But still he gain’d some comfort by the news
3125,_THE PATRON._,"Of John’s promotion, though with humbler views;          610"
3126,_THE PATRON._,For he conceived that in no distant time
3127,_THE PATRON._,The boy would learn to scramble and to climb.
3128,_THE PATRON._,"He little thought a son, his hope and pride,"
3129,_THE PATRON._,"His favour’d boy, was now a home denied:"
3130,_THE PATRON._,Yes! while the parent was intent to trace
3131,_THE PATRON._,"How men in office climb from place to place,"
3132,_THE PATRON._,"By day, by night, o’er moor and heath and hill,  }"
3133,_THE PATRON._,"Roved the sad youth, with ever-changing will,    }"
3134,_THE PATRON._,"Of every aid bereft, exposed to every ill.       }"
3135,_THE PATRON._,"Thus as he sate, absorb’d in all the care              620"
3136,_THE PATRON._,"And all the hope that anxious fathers share,"
3137,_THE PATRON._,"A friend abruptly to his presence brought,"
3138,_THE PATRON._,"With trembling hand, the subject of his thought,"
3139,_THE PATRON._,Whom he had found afflicted and subdued
3140,_THE PATRON._,"By hunger, sorrow, cold, and solitude."
3141,_THE PATRON._,Silent he enter’d the forgotten room
3142,_THE PATRON._,As ghostly forms may be conceived to come;
3143,_THE PATRON._,"With sorrow-shrunken face and hair upright,"
3144,_THE PATRON._,"He look’d dismay, neglect, despair, affright;"
3145,_THE PATRON._,"But, dead to comfort, and on misery thrown,              630"
3146,_THE PATRON._,"His parent’s loss he felt not, nor his own."
3147,_THE PATRON._,"The good man, struck with horror, cried aloud,"
3148,_THE PATRON._,And drew around him an astonish’d crowd;
3149,_THE PATRON._,"The sons and servants to the father ran,"
3150,_THE PATRON._,To share the feelings of the grieved old man.
3151,_THE PATRON._,"“Our brother, speak!” they all exclaim’d; “explain"
3152,_THE PATRON._,"Thy grief, thy suffering;”--but they ask’d in vain:"
3153,_THE PATRON._,"The friend told all he knew; and all was known,"
3154,_THE PATRON._,Save the sad causes whence the ills had grown.
3155,_THE PATRON._,"But, if obscure the cause, they all agreed               640"
3156,_THE PATRON._,From rest and kindness must the cure proceed:
3157,_THE PATRON._,"And he was cured; for quiet, love, and care,"
3158,_THE PATRON._,"Strove with the gloom, and broke on the despair."
3159,_THE PATRON._,"Yet slow their progress; and, as vapours move"
3160,_THE PATRON._,Dense and reluctant from the wintry grove;
3161,_THE PATRON._,All is confusion till the morning light
3162,_THE PATRON._,Gives the dim scene obscurely to the sight;
3163,_THE PATRON._,"More and yet more defined the trunks appear,"
3164,_THE PATRON._,Till the wild prospect stands distinct and clear--
3165,_THE PATRON._,So the dark mind of our young poet grew                  650
3166,_THE PATRON._,Clear and sedate; the dreadful mist withdrew;
3167,_THE PATRON._,"And he resembled that bleak wintry scene,"
3168,_THE PATRON._,"Sad, though unclouded; dismal, though serene."
3169,_THE PATRON._,"At times he utter’d, “What a dream was mine!"
3170,_THE PATRON._,And what a prospect! glorious and divine!
3171,_THE PATRON._,"Oh! in that room, and on that night, to see"
3172,_THE PATRON._,"These looks, that sweetness beaming all on me;"
3173,_THE PATRON._,"That syren-flattery--and to send me then,"
3174,_THE PATRON._,"Hope-raised and soften’d, to those heartless men;"
3175,_THE PATRON._,"That dark-brow’d stern director, pleased to show         660"
3176,_THE PATRON._,Knowledge of subjects I disdain’d to know;
3177,_THE PATRON._,"Cold and controlling--but ’tis gone, ’tis past;"
3178,_THE PATRON._,"I had my trial, and have peace at last.”"
3179,_THE PATRON._,Now grew the youth resign’d; he bade adieu
3180,_THE PATRON._,"To all that hope, to all that fancy drew;"
3181,_THE PATRON._,"His frame was languid, and the hectic heat"
3182,_THE PATRON._,"Flush’d on his pallid face, and countless beat"
3183,_THE PATRON._,"The quick’ning pulse, and faint the limbs that bore"
3184,_THE PATRON._,The slender form that soon would breathe no more.
3185,_THE PATRON._,"Then hope of holy kind the soul sustain’d,             670"
3186,_THE PATRON._,And not a lingering thought of earth remain’d;
3187,_THE PATRON._,"Now Heaven had all, and he could smile at love,"
3188,_THE PATRON._,And the wild sallies of his youth reprove;
3189,_THE PATRON._,"Then could he dwell upon the tempting days,"
3190,_THE PATRON._,"The proud aspiring thought, the partial praise;"
3191,_THE PATRON._,"Victorious now, his worldly views were closed,"
3192,_THE PATRON._,And on the bed of death the youth reposed.
3193,_THE PATRON._,"The father grieved--but, as the poet’s heart"
3194,_THE PATRON._,Was all unfitted for his earthly part;
3195,_THE PATRON._,"As, he conceived, some other haughty fair                680"
3196,_THE PATRON._,"Would, had he lived, have led him to despair;"
3197,_THE PATRON._,"As, with this fear, the silent grave shut out"
3198,_THE PATRON._,"All feverish hope, and all tormenting doubt;"
3199,_THE PATRON._,"While the strong faith the pious youth possess’d,"
3200,_THE PATRON._,"His hope enlivening, gave his sorrows rest:"
3201,_THE PATRON._,"Soothed by these thoughts, he felt a mournful joy"
3202,_THE PATRON._,For his aspiring and devoted boy.
3203,_THE PATRON._,Meantime the news through various channels spread:
3204,_THE PATRON._,"The youth, once favour’d with such praise, was dead."
3205,_THE PATRON._,"“Emma,” the lady cried, “my words attend,                690"
3206,_THE PATRON._,Your syren-smiles have kill’d your humble friend;
3207,_THE PATRON._,"The hope you raised can now delude no more,"
3208,_THE PATRON._,"Nor charms, that once inspired, can now restore.”"
3209,_THE PATRON._,"Faint was the flush of anger and of shame,"
3210,_THE PATRON._,That o’er the cheek of conscious beauty came.
3211,_THE PATRON._,"“You censure not,” said she, “the sun’s bright rays,"
3212,_THE PATRON._,When fools imprudent dare the dangerous gaze;
3213,_THE PATRON._,"And, should a stripling look till he were blind,"
3214,_THE PATRON._,You would not justly call the light unkind.--
3215,_THE PATRON._,But is he dead? and am I to suppose                      700
3216,_THE PATRON._,The power of poison in such looks as those?”
3217,_THE PATRON._,"She spoke, and, pointing to the mirror, cast"
3218,_THE PATRON._,"A pleased gay glance, and curtsied as she pass’d."
3219,_THE PATRON._,"My lord, to whom the poet’s fate was told,"
3220,_THE PATRON._,"Was much affected, for a man so cold."
3221,_THE PATRON._,"“Dead!” said his lordship, “run distracted, mad!"
3222,_THE PATRON._,Upon my soul I’m sorry for the lad;
3223,_THE PATRON._,"And now, no doubt, th’ obliging world will say"
3224,_THE PATRON._,That my harsh usage help’d him on his way.
3225,_THE PATRON._,"What! I suppose, I should have nursed his muse,          710"
3226,_THE PATRON._,And with champagne have brighten’d up his views:
3227,_THE PATRON._,"Then had he made me famed my whole life long,"
3228,_THE PATRON._,And stunn’d my ears with gratitude and song.
3229,_THE PATRON._,"Still, should the father hear that I regret"
3230,_THE PATRON._,Our joint misfortune--Yes! I’ll not forget.”--
3231,_THE PATRON._,Thus they.--The father to his grave convey’d
3232,_THE PATRON._,"The son he loved, and his last duties paid."
3233,_THE PATRON._,"“There lies my boy,” he cried, “of care bereft,"
3234,_THE PATRON._,"And, Heav’n be praised, I’ve not a genius left:"
3235,_THE PATRON._,"No one among ye, sons! is doom’d to live                 720"
3236,_THE PATRON._,On high-raised hopes of what the great may give;
3237,_THE PATRON._,"None, with exalted views and fortunes mean,"
3238,_THE PATRON._,"To die in anguish, or to live in spleen."
3239,_THE PATRON._,Your pious brother soon escaped the strife
3240,_THE PATRON._,"Of such contention, but it cost his life;"
3241,_THE PATRON._,"You then, my sons, upon yourselves depend,"
3242,_THE PATRON._,And in your own exertions find the friend.”

3351,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,They with the world’s distress their spirits cheer’d;
3352,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The nation’s guilt, that would not long endure"
3353,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The reign of men so modest and so pure.                   70
3354,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Their town was large, and seldom pass’d a day"
3355,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But some had fail’d, and others gone astray;"
3356,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Clerks had absconded, wives eloped, girls flown"
3357,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"To Gretna-Green, or sons rebellious grown;"
3358,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Quarrels and fires arose;--and it was plain
3359,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The times were bad; the saints had ceased to reign!
3360,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,A few yet lived to languish and to mourn
3361,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"For good old manners, never to return."
3362,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Jonas had sisters, and of these was one"
3363,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Who lost a husband and an only son:                       80
3364,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Twelve months her sables she in sorrow wore,"
3365,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And mourn’d so long that she could mourn no more.
3366,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Distant from Jonas, and from all her race,"
3367,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,She now resided in a lively place;
3368,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"There, by the sect unseen, at whist she play’d,"
3369,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Nor was of churchmen or their church afraid.
3370,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"If much of this the graver brother heard,"
3371,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"He something censured, but he little fear’d;"
3372,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"He knew her rich and frugal; for the rest,"
3373,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"He felt no care, or, if he felt, suppress’d;              90"
3374,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Nor, for companion when she ask’d her niece,"
3375,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Had he suspicions that disturbed his peace;
3376,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Frugal and rich, these virtues as a charm"
3377,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Preserved the thoughtful man from all alarm;
3378,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"An infant yet, she soon would home return,"
3379,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Nor stay the manners of the world to learn;
3380,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Meantime his boys would all his care engross,"
3381,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And be his comforts if he felt the loss.
3382,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The sprightly Sybil, pleased and unconfined,"
3383,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Felt the pure pleasure of the op’ning mind:              100
3384,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,All here was gay and cheerful--all at home
3385,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Unvaried quiet and unruffled gloom.
3386,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"There were no changes, and amusements few;"
3387,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Here, all was varied, wonderful, and new;"
3388,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"There were plain meals, plain dresses, and grave looks--"
3389,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Here, gay companions and amusing books;"
3390,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And the young beauty soon began to taste
3391,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The light vocations of the scene she graced.
3392,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,A man of business feels it as a crime
3393,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,On calls domestic to consume his time;                   110
3394,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Yet this grave man had not so cold a heart,"
3395,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,But with his daughter he was grieved to part;
3396,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And he demanded that in every year
3397,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The aunt and niece should at his house appear.
3398,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Yes! we must go, my child, and by our dress"
3399,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,A grave conformity of mind express;
3400,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Must sing at meeting, and from cards refrain,"
3401,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The more t’ enjoy when we return again.”
3402,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thus spake the aunt, and the discerning child"
3403,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Was pleased to learn how fathers are beguiled.           120
3404,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Her artful part the young dissembler took,"
3405,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And from the matron caught th’ approving look.
3406,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"When thrice the friends had met, excuse was sent"
3407,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"For more delay, and Jonas was content;"
3408,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Till a tall maiden by her sire was seen,"
3409,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,In all the bloom and beauty of sixteen;
3410,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"He gazed admiring;--she, with visage prim,"
3411,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Glanced an arch look of gravity on him;
3412,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"For she was gay at heart, but wore disguise,"
3413,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And stood a vestal in her father’s eyes--               130
3414,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Pure, pensive, simple, sad; the damsel’s heart,"
3415,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"When Jonas praised, reproved her for the part;"
3416,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"For Sybil, fond of pleasure, gay and light,"
3417,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Had still a secret bias to the right;
3418,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Vain as she was--and flattery made her vain--
3419,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Her simulation gave her bosom pain.
3420,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Again return’d, the matron and the niece"
3421,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Found the late quiet gave their joy increase;
3422,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The aunt, infirm, no more her visits paid,"
3423,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,But still with her sojourn’d the favourite maid.         140
3424,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Letters were sent when franks could be procured;
3425,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And, when they could not, silence was endured."
3426,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"All were in health, and, if they older grew,"
3427,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,It seem’d a fact that none among them knew;
3428,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The aunt and niece still led a pleasant life,"
3429,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And quiet days had Jonas and his wife.
3430,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Near him a widow dwelt of worthy fame:
3431,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Like his her manners, and her creed the same."
3432,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The wealth her husband left her care retain’d
3433,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"For one tall youth, and widow she remained;              150"
3434,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"His love respectful all her care repaid,"
3435,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Her wishes watch’d, and her commands obey’d."
3436,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Sober he was and grave from early youth,"
3437,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Mindful of forms, but more intent on truth;"
3438,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"In a light drab he uniformly dress’d,"
3439,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And look serene th’ unruffled mind express’d;
3440,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"A hat with ample verge his brows o’erspread,"
3441,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And his brown locks curl’d graceful on his head;
3442,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Yet might observers in his speaking eye              }
3443,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Some observation, some acuteness spy;                }   160"
3444,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The friendly thought it keen, the treacherous deem’d }"
3445,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,it sly.                                  }
3446,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Yet not a crime could foe or friend detect;
3447,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"His actions all were, like his speech, correct;"
3448,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And they who jested on a mind so sound,"
3449,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Upon his virtues must their laughter found:
3450,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"‘Chaste, sober, solemn,’ and ‘devout’ they named"
3451,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Him who was thus, and not of _this_ ashamed."
3452,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Such were the virtues Jonas found in one
3453,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,In whom he warmly wish’d to find a son.
3454,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Three years had pass’d since he had Sybil seen;          170
3455,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,But she was doubtless what she once had been--
3456,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Lovely and mild, obedient and discreet:"
3457,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The pair must love whenever they should meet;
3458,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Then, ere the widow or her son should choose"
3459,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Some happier maid, he would explain his views."
3460,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Now she, like him, was politic and shrewd,"
3461,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,With strong desire of lawful gain embued;
3462,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"To all he said, she bow’d with much respect,"
3463,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Pleased to comply, yet seeming to reject;"
3464,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Cool, and yet eager, each admired the strength           180"
3465,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Of the opponent, and agreed at length."
3466,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"As a drawn battle shows to each a force,"
3467,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Powerful as his, he honours it of course:"
3468,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"So in these neighbours, each the power discern’d,"
3469,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And gave the praise that was to each return’d.
3470,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Jonas now ask’d his daughter; and the aunt,"
3471,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Though loth to lose her, was obliged to grant.--"
3472,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But would not Sybil to the matron cling,"
3473,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And fear to leave the shelter of her wing?
3474,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"No! in the young there lives a love of change,           190"
3475,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And to the easy they prefer the strange!
3476,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Then too the joys she once pursued with zeal,"
3477,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"From whist and visits sprung, she ceased to feel;"
3478,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"When with the matrons Sybil first sat down,"
3479,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"To cut for partners and to stake her crown,"
3480,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"This to the youthful maid preferment seem’d,"
3481,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Who thought [that] woman she was then esteem’d;
3482,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But in few years, when she perceived, indeed,"
3483,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The real woman to the girl succeed,"
3484,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"No longer tricks and honours fill’d her mind,            200"
3485,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But other feelings, not so well defined."
3486,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"She then reluctant grew, and thought it hard,"
3487,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,To sit and ponder o’er an ugly card;
3488,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Rather the nut-tree shade the nymph preferr’d,"
3489,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Pleased with the pensive gloom and evening bird;
3490,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thither, from company retired, she took"
3491,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The silent walk, or read the fav’rite book."
3492,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The father’s letter, sudden, short, and kind,"
3493,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Awaked her wonder, and disturb’d her mind;"
3494,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"She found new dreams upon her fancy seize,               210"
3495,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Wild roving thoughts and endless reveries.
3496,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The parting came;--and, when the aunt perceived"
3497,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The tears of Sybil, and how much she grieved,"
3498,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"To love for her that tender grief she laid,"
3499,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"That various, soft, contending passions made."
3500,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"When Sybil rested in her father’s arms,"
3501,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,His pride exulted in a daughter’s charms;
3502,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"A maid accomplish’d he was pleased to find,"
3503,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Nor seem’d the form more lovely than the mind.
3504,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But when the fit of pride and fondness fled,             220"
3505,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,He saw his judgment by his hopes misled;
3506,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"High were the lady’s spirits, far more free"
3507,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Her mode of speaking than a maid’s should be;
3508,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Too much, as Jonas thought, she seem’d to know,"
3509,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And all her knowledge was disposed to show:
3510,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Too gay her dress, like theirs who idly dote"
3511,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"On a young coxcomb, or a coxcomb’s coat;"
3512,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"In foolish spirits when our friends appear,"
3513,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And vainly grave when not a man is near.”
3514,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thus Jonas, adding to his sorrow blame,                230"
3515,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And terms disdainful to his sister’s name:--
3516,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“The sinful wretch has by her arts defiled
3517,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The ductile spirit of my darling child.”
3518,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“The maid is virtuous,” said the dame.--Quoth he,"
3519,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Let her give proof, by acting virtuously:"
3520,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Is it in gaping when the elders pray?
3521,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,In reading nonsense half a summer’s day?
3522,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"In those mock forms that she delights to trace,"
3523,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Or her loud laughs in Hezekiah’s face?
3524,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,She--O Susannah!--to the world belongs;         }        240
3525,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"She loves the follies of its idle throngs,      }"
3526,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And reads soft tales of love, and sings love’s  }"
3527,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,soft’ning songs.                     }
3528,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But, as our friend is yet delay’d in town,"
3529,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,We must prepare her till the youth comes down;
3530,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,You shall advise the maiden; I will threat;
3531,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Her fears and hopes may yield us comfort yet.”
3532,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Now the grave father took the lass aside,"
3533,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Demanding sternly, “Wilt thou be a bride?”"
3534,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"She answer’d, calling up an air sedate,"
3535,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“I have not vow’d against the holy state.”               250
3536,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“No folly, Sybil,” said the parent; “know"
3537,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,What to their parents virtuous maidens owe:
3538,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"A worthy, wealthy youth, whom I approve,"
3539,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Must thou prepare to honour and to love.
3540,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Formal to thee his air and dress may seem,"
3541,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,But the good youth is worthy of esteem;
3542,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Shouldst thou with rudeness treat him, of disdain"
3543,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Should he with justice or of slight complain,"
3544,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Or of one taunting speech give certain proof:
3545,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Girl! I reject thee from my sober roof.”                 260
3546,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“My aunt,” said Sybil, “will with pride protect"
3547,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,One whom a father can for this reject;
3548,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Nor shall a formal, rigid, soul-less boy"
3549,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"My manners alter, or my views destroy!”"
3550,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Jonas [then] lifted up his hands on high,          }"
3551,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And, utt’ring something ’twixt a groan and sigh,     }"
3552,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Left the determined maid her doubtful mother by.     }
3553,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Hear me,” she said; “incline thy heart, my child,"
3554,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And fix thy fancy on a man so mild;
3555,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thy father, Sybil, never could be moved                  270"
3556,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"By one who loved him, or by one he loved."
3557,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Union like ours is but a bargain made
3558,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"By slave and tyrant--he will be obey’d,"
3559,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Then calls the quiet comfort;--but thy youth
3560,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Is mild by nature, and as frank as truth.”"
3561,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“But will he love?” said Sybil; “I am told
3562,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,That these mild creatures are by nature cold.”
3563,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Alas!” the matron answer’d, “much I dread"
3564,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,That dangerous love by which the young are led!
3565,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"That love is earthy; you the creature prize,             280"
3566,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And trust your feelings and believe your eyes:
3567,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Can eyes and feelings inward worth descry?
3568,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"No! my fair daughter, on our choice rely!"
3569,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Your love, like that display’d upon the stage,"
3570,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Indulged is folly, and opposed is rage;--"
3571,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"More prudent love our sober couples show,"
3572,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,All that to mortal beings mortals owe.
3573,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"All flesh is grass--before you give a heart,"
3574,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Remember, Sybil, that in death you part;"
3575,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And, should your husband die before your love,           290"
3576,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,What needless anguish must a widow prove!
3577,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"No! my fair child, let all such visions cease;"
3578,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Yield but esteem, and only try for peace.”"
3579,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“I must be loved,” said Sybil; “I must see"
3580,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The man in terrors who aspires to me;
3581,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"At my forbidding frown his heart must ache,"
3582,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"His tongue must falter, and his frame must shake;"
3583,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And, if I grant him at my feet to kneel,"
3584,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"What trembling, fearful pleasure must he feel;"
3585,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Nay, such the raptures that my smiles inspire,           300"
3586,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,That reason’s self must for a time retire.”
3587,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Alas! for good Josiah,” said the dame,"
3588,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“These wicked thoughts would fill his soul with shame.
3589,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,He kneel and tremble at a thing of dust!
3590,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"He cannot, child.”--The child replied, “He must.”"
3591,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,They ceased; the matron left her with a frown;
3592,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,So Jonas met her when the youth came down.
3593,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Behold,” said he, “thy future spouse attends;"
3594,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Receive him, daughter, as the best of friends;"
3595,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Observe, respect him--humble be each word,               310"
3596,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,That welcomes home thy husband and thy lord.”
3597,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Forewarn’d, thought Sybil, with a bitter smile,"
3598,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,I shall prepare my manner and my style.
3599,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Ere yet Josiah enter’d on his task,"
3600,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The father met him:--“Deign to wear a mask
3601,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"A few dull days, Josiah--but a few--"
3602,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"It is our duty, and the sex’s due;"
3603,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"I wore it once, and every grateful wife"
3604,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Repays it with obedience through her life:
3605,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Have no regard to Sybil’s dress, have none           }   320"
3606,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"To her pert language, to her flippant tone:          }"
3607,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Henceforward thou shalt rule unquestion’d and alone; }
3608,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And she thy pleasure in thy looks shall seek--
3609,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"How she shall dress, and whether she may speak.”"
3610,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"A sober smile return’d the youth, and said,"
3611,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Can I cause fear, who am myself afraid?”"
3612,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Sybil, meantime, sat thoughtful in her room,"
3613,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And often wonder’d--“Will the creature come?
3614,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Nothing shall tempt, shall force me to bestow"
3615,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,My hand upon him--yet I wish to know.”                   330
3616,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The door unclosed, and she beheld her sire"
3617,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Lead in the youth, then hasten to retire."
3618,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Daughter, my friend--my daughter, friend,” he cried,"
3619,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And gave a meaning look, and stepp’d aside;"
3620,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"That look contain’d a mingled threat and prayer,"
3621,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Do take him, child--offend him, if you dare.”"
3622,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The couple gazed--were silent; and the maid
3623,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Look’d in his face, to make the man afraid;"
3624,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The man, unmoved, upon the maiden cast"
3625,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,A steady view--so salutation pass’d;                     340
3626,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,But in this instant Sybil’s eye had seen
3627,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The tall fair person, and the still staid mien;"
3628,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The glow that temp’rance o’er the cheek had spread,"
3629,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Where the soft down half veil’d the purest red;
3630,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And the serene deportment that proclaim’d
3631,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"A heart unspotted, and a life unblamed."
3632,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But then with these she saw attire too plain,"
3633,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The pale brown coat, though worn without a stain;"
3634,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The formal air, and something of the pride"
3635,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,That indicates the wealth it seems to hide;              350
3636,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And looks that were not, she conceived, exempt"
3637,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"From a proud pity, or a sly contempt."
3638,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Josiah’s eyes had their employment too,"
3639,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Engaged and soften’d by so bright a view:
3640,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"A fair and meaning face, an eye of fire,"
3641,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"That check’d the bold, and made the free retire."
3642,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,But then with these he mark’d the studied dress
3643,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And lofty air, that scorn or pride express;"
3644,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"With that insidious look, that seem’d to hide"
3645,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,In an affected smile the scorn and pride;                360
3646,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And if his mind the virgin’s meaning caught,        }"
3647,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,He saw a foe with treacherous purpose fraught--     }
3648,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Captive the heart to take, and to reject it caught. }"
3649,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Silent they sate--thought Sybil, that he seeks"
3650,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Something, no doubt; I wonder if he speaks."
3651,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Scarcely she wonder’d, when these accents fell"
3652,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Slow in her ear--“Fair maiden, art thou well?”--"
3653,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Art thou physician?” she replied; “my hand,"
3654,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"My pulse, at least, shall be at thy command.”"
3655,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"She said--and saw, surprised, Josiah kneel,            370"
3656,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And gave his lips the offer’d pulse to feel;
3657,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The rosy colour rising in her cheek
3658,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Seem’d that surprise, unmix’d with wrath, to speak;"
3659,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Then sternness she assumed, and--“Doctor, tell,"
3660,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Thy words cannot alarm me--am I well?”
3661,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Thou art,” said he; “and yet thy dress so light,"
3662,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"I do conceive, some danger must excite.”"
3663,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“In whom?” said Sybil, with a look demure;"
3664,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“In more,” said he, “than I expect to cure."
3665,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"I, in thy light luxuriant robe, behold               }"
3666,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Want and excess, abounding and yet cold:             }"
3667,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Here needed, there display’d, in many a wanton fold; }"
3668,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Both health and beauty, learned authors show,"
3669,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,From a just medium in our clothing flow.”
3670,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Proceed, good doctor; if so great my need,"
3671,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,What is thy fee? Good doctor! pray proceed.”
3672,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Large is my fee, fair lady, but I take"
3673,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,None till some progress in my cure I make.
3674,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thou hast disease, fair maiden; thou art vain;"
3675,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Within that face sit insult and disdain;                 390
3676,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Thou art enamour’d of thyself; my art
3677,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Can see the naughty malice of thy heart;
3678,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"With a strong pleasure would thy bosom move,"
3679,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Were I to own thy power, and ask thy love;"
3680,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And such thy beauty, damsel, that I might,            }"
3681,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But for thy pride, feel danger in thy sight,          }"
3682,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And lose my present peace in dreams of vain delight.” }
3683,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“And can thy patients,” said the nymph, “endure"
3684,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Physic like this? and will it work a cure?”
3685,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Such is my hope, fair damsel; thou, I find,           400"
3686,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Hast the true tokens of a noble mind;
3687,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But the world wins thee, Sybil, and thy joys"
3688,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Are placed in trifles, fashions, follies, toys;"
3689,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thou hast sought pleasure in the world around,"
3690,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,That in thine own pure bosom should be found.
3691,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Did all that world admire thee, praise and love,"
3692,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Could it the least of nature’s pains remove?
3693,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Could it for errors, follies, sins atone,"
3694,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Or give thee comfort, thoughtful and alone?"
3695,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"It has, believe me, maid, no power to charm              410"
3696,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thy soul from sorrow, or thy flesh from harm:"
3697,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Turn then, fair creature, from a world of sin,"
3698,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And seek the jewel happiness within.”
3699,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“Speak’st thou at meeting?” said the nymph; “thy speech
3700,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Is that of mortal very prone to teach;
3701,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But wouldst thou, doctor, from the patient learn"
3702,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Thine own disease?--The cure is thy concern.”
3703,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Yea, with good will.”--“Then know, ’tis thy complaint,"
3704,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"That, for a sinner, thou’rt too much a saint;"
3705,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Hast too much show of the sedate and pure,               420"
3706,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And without cause art formal and demure:
3707,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"This makes a man unsocial, unpolite;"
3708,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Odious when wrong, and insolent if right."
3709,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thou may’st be good, but why should goodness be"
3710,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Wrapt in a garb of such formality?
3711,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thy person well might please a damsel’s eye,"
3712,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,In decent habit with a scarlet dye;
3713,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But, jest apart--what virtue canst thou trace"
3714,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,In that broad brim that hides thy sober face?
3715,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Does that long-skirted drab, that over-nice              430"
3716,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And formal clothing, prove a scorn of vice?"
3717,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Then for thine accent--what in sound can be
3718,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,So void of grace as dull monotony?
3719,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Love has a thousand varied notes to move
3720,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The human heart--thou may’st not speak of love
3721,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Till thou hast cast thy formal ways aside,"
3722,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And those becoming youth and nature tried;
3723,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Not till exterior freedom, spirit, ease,"
3724,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Prove it thy study and delight to please;
3725,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Not till these follies meet thy just disdain,            440"
3726,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,While yet thy virtues and thy worth remain.”
3727,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“This is severe!--Oh! maiden, wilt not thou"
3728,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Something for habits, manners, modes, allow?”--"
3729,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Yes! but allowing much, I much require,"
3730,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"In my behalf, for manners, modes, attire!”"
3731,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“True, lovely Sybil; and, this point agreed,"
3732,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Let me to those of greater weight proceed:
3733,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Thy father”--“Nay,” she quickly interposed,"
3734,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Good doctor, here our conference is closed!”"
3735,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Then left the youth, who, lost in his retreat,         450"
3736,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Pass’d the good matron on her garden-seat;
3737,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"His looks were troubled, and his air, once mild"
3738,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And calm, was hurried:--“My audacious child!”"
3739,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Exclaim’d the dame, “I read what she has done"
3740,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,In thy displeasure--Ah! the thoughtless one;
3741,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"But yet, Josiah, to my stern good man"
3742,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Speak of the maid as mildly as you can.
3743,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Can you not seem to woo a little while
3744,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The daughter’s will, the father to beguile,"
3745,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,So that his wrath in time may wear away?                 460
3746,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Will you preserve our peace, Josiah? say!”"
3747,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Yes! my good neighbour,” said the gentle youth,"
3748,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“Rely securely on my care and truth;
3749,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And, should thy comfort with my efforts cease,"
3750,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,And only then--perpetual is thy peace.”
3751,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The dame had doubts: she well his virtues knew,"
3752,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"His deeds were friendly, and his words were true;"
3753,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“But to address this vixen is a task
3754,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"He is ashamed to take, and I to ask.”"
3755,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Soon as the father from Josiah learn’d                   470
3756,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"What pass’d with Sybil, he the truth discern’d."
3757,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“He loves,” the man exclaim’d, “he loves, ’tis plain,"
3758,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"The thoughtless girl, and shall he love in vain?"
3759,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"She may be stubborn, but she shall be tried,"
3760,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Born as she is of wilfulness and pride.”
3761,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"With anger fraught, but willing to persuade,"
3762,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,The wrathful father met the smiling maid.
3763,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Sybil,” said he, “I long, and yet I dread"
3764,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"To know thy conduct--hath Josiah fled,"
3765,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"And, grieved and fretted by thy scornful air,            480"
3766,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,For his lost peace betaken him to prayer?
3767,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Couldst thou his pure and modest mind distress,    }"
3768,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"By vile remarks upon his speech, address,          }"
3769,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"Attire, and voice?”--“All this I must confess.”--  }"
3770,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“Unhappy child! what labour will it cost
3771,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,To win him back!”--“I do not think him lost.”
3772,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Courts he then, trifler, insult and disdain?”--"
3773,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“No: but from these he courts me to refrain.”--
3774,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Then hear me, Sybil: should Josiah leave"
3775,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Thy father’s house?”--“My father’s child would grieve.”--
3776,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“That is of grace; and if he come again                  491
3777,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,To speak of love?”--“I might from grief refrain.”--
3778,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Then wilt thou, daughter, our design embrace?”--"
3779,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,"“Can I resist it, if it be of grace?”--"
3780,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,“Dear child! in three plain words thy mind express--
3781,_THE FRANK COURTSHIP._,Wilt thou have this good youth?”--“Dear father! yes.”

3930,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,How must you scorn the farmer and the farm!”
3931,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The widow smiled, and “Know you not,” said she,   }"
3932,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,“How much these farmers scorn or pity me;           }
3933,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Who see what you admire, and laugh at all they see? }    120"
3934,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"True, their opinion alters not my fate,"
3935,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,By falsely judging of an humble state:
3936,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"This garden, you with such delight behold,"
3937,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Tempts not a feeble dame who dreads the cold;
3938,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"These plants, which please so well your livelier sense,"
3939,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,To mine but little of their sweets dispense;
3940,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Books soon are painful to my failing sight,"
3941,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And oftener read from duty than delight;
3942,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"(Yet let me own, that I can sometimes find"
3943,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Both joy and duty in the act combined;)                  130
3944,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But view me rightly, you will see no more"
3945,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Than a poor female, willing to be poor;"
3946,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Happy indeed, but not in books nor flowers,"
3947,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Not in fair dreams, indulged in earlier hours,"
3948,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Of never-tasted joys--such visions shun,"
3949,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"My youthful friend, nor scorn the farmer’s son.”"
3950,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Nay,” said the damsel, nothing pleased to see"
3951,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,A friend’s advice could like a father’s be;
3952,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Bless’d in your cottage, you must surely smile"
3953,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,At those who live in our detested style.                 140
3954,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,To my Lucinda’s sympathizing heart
3955,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Could I my prospects and my griefs impart,"
3956,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,She would console me; but I dare not show
3957,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Ills that would wound her tender soul to know:
3958,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And I confess, it shocks my pride to tell"
3959,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,The secrets of the prison where I dwell;
3960,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,For that dear maiden would be shock’d to feel
3961,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,The secrets I should shudder to reveal;
3962,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"When told her friend was by a parent ask’d,"
3963,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,‘Fed you the swine?’--Good heav’n! how I am task’d!      150
3964,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,What! can you smile? Ah! smile not at the grief
3965,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,That woos your pity and demands relief.”
3966,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Trifles, my love; you take a false alarm;"
3967,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Think, I beseech you, better of the farm:"
3968,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Duties in every state demand your care,"
3969,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And light are those that will require it there:
3970,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Fix on the youth a favouring eye, and these,"
3971,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"To him pertaining, or as his, will please.”"
3972,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“What words,” the lass replied, “offend my ear!"
3973,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Try you my patience? Can you be sincere?                 160
3974,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And am I told a willing hand to give
3975,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"To a rude farmer, and with rustic live?"
3976,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Far other fate was yours--some gentle youth
3977,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Admired your beauty, and avow’d his truth;"
3978,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The power of love prevail’d, and freely both"
3979,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Gave the fond heart, and pledged the binding oath;"
3980,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And then the rivals’ plot, the parent’s power,"
3981,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And jealous fears, drew on the happy hour:"
3982,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Ah! let not memory lose the blissful view,"
3983,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,But fairly show what love has done for you.”             170
3984,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Agreed, my daughter; what my heart has known"
3985,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Of love’s strange power shall be with frankness shown:
3986,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But let me warn you, that experience finds"
3987,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Few of the scenes that lively hope designs.”--
3988,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Mysterious all,” said Nancy; “you, I know,"
3989,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Have suffer’d much; now deign the grief to show--
3990,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"I am your friend, and so prepare my heart"
3991,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,In all your sorrows to receive a part.”
3992,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The widow answer’d: “I had once, like you,"
3993,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Such thoughts of love; no dream is more untrue.          180
3994,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,You judge it fated and decreed to dwell          }
3995,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"In youthful hearts, which nothing can expel,     }"
3996,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"A passion doom’d to reign, and irresistible.     }"
3997,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The struggling mind, when once subdued, in vain"
3998,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Rejects the fury or defies the pain;
3999,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The strongest reason fails the flame t’ allay,"
4000,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And resolution droops and faints away:
4001,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Hence, when the destined lovers meet, they prove"
4002,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,At once the force of this all-powerful love;
4003,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Each from that period feels the mutual smart,            190"
4004,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Nor seeks to cure it--heart is changed for heart;
4005,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Nor is there peace till they delighted stand,"
4006,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And, at the altar, hand is join’d to hand."
4007,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Alas! my child, there are who, dreaming so,"
4008,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Waste their fresh youth, and waking feel the wo;"
4009,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,There is no spirit sent the heart to move
4010,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,With such prevailing and alarming love;
4011,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Passion to reason will submit--or why
4012,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Should wealthy maids the poorest swains deny?
4013,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Or how could classes and degrees create                  200
4014,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,The slightest bar to such resistless fate?
4015,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Yet high and low, you see, forbear to mix;"
4016,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,No beggars’ eyes the heart of kings transfix;
4017,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And who but am’rous peers or nobles sigh
4018,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,When titled beauties pass triumphant by?
4019,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"For reason wakes, proud wishes to reprove;"
4020,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"You cannot hope, and therefore dare not love:"
4021,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"All would be safe, did we at first inquire--"
4022,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,‘Does reason sanction what our hearts desire?’
4023,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But, quitting precept, let example show                  210"
4024,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,What joys from love uncheck’d by prudence flow.
4025,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“A youth my father in his office placed,"
4026,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Of humble fortune, but with sense and taste;"
4027,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But he was thin and pale, had downcast looks;"
4028,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"He studied much, and pored upon his books:"
4029,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Confused he was when seen, and, when he saw"
4030,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Me or my sisters, would in haste withdraw;"
4031,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And had this youth departed with the year,"
4032,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,His loss had cost us neither sigh nor tear.
4033,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“But with my father still the youth remain’d,          220"
4034,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And more reward and kinder notice gain’d:
4035,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"He often, reading, to the garden stray’d,"
4036,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Where I by books or musing was delay’d;
4037,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"This to discourse in summer evenings led,"
4038,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Of these same evenings, or of what we read."
4039,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,On such occasions we were much alone;
4040,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But, save the look, the manner, and the tone,"
4041,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"(These might have meaning,) all that we discuss’d"
4042,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,We could with pleasure to a parent trust.
4043,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,“At length ’twas friendship--and my friend and I       230
4044,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Said we were happy, and began to sigh;"
4045,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"My sisters first, and then my father, found"
4046,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,That we were wandering o’er enchanted ground;
4047,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But he had troubles in his own affairs,"
4048,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And would not bear addition to his cares.
4049,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"With pity moved, yet angry, ‘Child,’ said he,"
4050,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,‘Will you embrace contempt and beggary?
4051,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Can you endure to see each other cursed
4052,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"By want, of every human wo the worst?"
4053,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Warring for ever with distress, in dread                 240"
4054,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Either of begging or of wanting bread;
4055,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"While poverty, with unrelenting force,"
4056,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Will your own offspring from your love divorce;
4057,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"They, through your folly, must be doom’d to pine,"
4058,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And you deplore your passion, or resign;"
4059,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"For, if it die, what good will then remain?"
4060,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And if it live, it doubles every pain.’”--"
4061,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“But you were true,” exclaim’d the lass, “and fled   }"
4062,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,The tyrant’s power who fill’d your soul with dread?”-- }
4063,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“But,” said the smiling friend, “he fill’d my mouth    }"
4064,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,with bread;                                    } 250
4065,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And in what other place that bread to gain
4066,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"We long consider’d, and we sought in vain."
4067,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,This was my twentieth year--at thirty-five
4068,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Our hope was fainter, yet our love alive;"
4069,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,So many years in anxious doubt had pass’d.”--
4070,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Then,” said the damsel, “you were bless’d at last?”"
4071,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"A smile again adorn’d the widow’s face,"
4072,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,But soon a starting tear usurp’d its place.--
4073,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Slow pass’d the heavy years, and each had more"
4074,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Pains and vexations than the years before.               260
4075,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"My father fail’d; his family was rent,"
4076,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And to new states his grieving daughters sent;
4077,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Each to more thriving kindred found a way,"
4078,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Guests without welcome--servants without pay;
4079,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Our parting hour was grievous; still I feel
4080,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The sad, sweet converse at our final meal:"
4081,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Our father then reveal’d his former fears,"
4082,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Cause of his sternness, and then join’d our tears;"
4083,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Kindly he strove our feelings to repress,"
4084,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But died, and left us heirs to his distress.             270"
4085,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The rich, as humble friends, my sisters chose;"
4086,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,I with a wealthy widow sought repose;
4087,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Who with a chilling frown her friend received,"
4088,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Bade me rejoice, and wonder’d that I grieved:"
4089,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,In vain my anxious lover tried his skill
4090,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"To rise in life, he was dependent still;"
4091,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"We met in grief, nor can I paint the fears"
4092,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Of these unhappy, troubled, trying years:"
4093,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Our dying hopes and stronger fears between,"
4094,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,We felt no season peaceful or serene;                    280
4095,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Our fleeting joys, like meteors in the night,"
4096,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Shone on our gloom with inauspicious light;
4097,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And then domestic sorrows, till the mind,"
4098,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Worn with distresses, to despair inclined;"
4099,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Add too the ill that from the passion flows,"
4100,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,When its contemptuous frown the world bestows--
4101,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The peevish spirit caused by long delay,"
4102,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"When being gloomy we contemn the gay,"
4103,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"When, being wretched, we incline to hate"
4104,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And censure others in a happier state;                   290
4105,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Yet loving still, and still compell’d to move"
4106,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,In the sad labyrinth of ling’ring love:
4107,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"While you, exempt from want, despair, alarm,"
4108,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,May wed--oh! take the farmer and the farm.”
4109,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Nay,” said the nymph, “joy smiled on you at last!”"
4110,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Smiled for a moment,” she replied, “and pass’d:"
4111,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"My lover still the same dull means pursued,"
4112,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Assistant call’d, but kept in servitude;"
4113,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"His spirits wearied in the prime of life,"
4114,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,By fears and wishes in eternal strife;                   300
4115,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,At length he urged impatient--‘Now consent;
4116,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"With thee united, fortune may relent.’"
4117,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"I paused, consenting; but a friend arose,"
4118,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Pleased a fair view, though distant, to disclose;"
4119,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,From the rough ocean we beheld a gleam
4120,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Of joy, as transient as the joys we dream;"
4121,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"By lying hopes deceived, my friend retired,"
4122,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And sail’d--was wounded--reach’d us--and expired!
4123,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"You shall behold his grave, and, when I die,"
4124,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,There--but ’tis folly--I request to lie.”               310
4125,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Thus,” said the lass, “to joy you bade adieu!"
4126,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,But how a widow?--that cannot be true;
4127,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Or was it force, in some unhappy hour,"
4128,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"That placed you, grieving, in a tyrant’s power?”"
4129,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Force, my young friend, when forty years are fled,"
4130,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Is what a woman seldom has to dread;
4131,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"She needs no brazen locks nor guarding walls,"
4132,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"And seldom comes a lover, though she calls."
4133,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Yet moved by fancy, one approved my face,"
4134,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,Though time and tears had wrought it much disgrace.      320
4135,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“The man I married was sedate and meek,"
4136,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And spoke of love as men in earnest speak;
4137,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Poor as I was, he ceaseless sought, for years,"
4138,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,A heart in sorrow and a face in tears;
4139,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,That heart I gave not; and ’twas long before
4140,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"I gave attention, and then nothing more;"
4141,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,But in my breast some grateful feeling rose
4142,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,For one whose love so sad a subject chose;
4143,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Till long delaying, fearing to repent,"
4144,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But grateful still, I gave a cold assent.                330"
4145,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Thus we were wed; no fault had I to find,"
4146,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And he but one; my heart could not be kind:
4147,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Alas! of every early hope bereft,"
4148,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,There was no fondness in my bosom left;
4149,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"So had I told him, but had told in vain,"
4150,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,He lived but to indulge me and complain.
4151,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"His was this cottage, he inclosed this ground,"
4152,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And planted all these blooming shrubs around;
4153,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"He to my room these curious trifles brought,"
4154,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And with assiduous love my pleasure sought;              340
4155,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"He lived to please me, and I oft-times strove"
4156,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Smiling, to thank his unrequited love;"
4157,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"‘Teach me,’ he cried, ‘that pensive mind to ease,"
4158,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,For all my pleasure is the hope to please.’
4159,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Serene, though heavy, were the days we spent,"
4160,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Yet kind each word, and gen’rous each intent;"
4161,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"But his dejection lessen’d every day,"
4162,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And to a placid kindness died away.
4163,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"In tranquil ease we pass’d our latter years,"
4164,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"By griefs untroubl’d, unassail’d by fears.               350"
4165,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Let not romantic views your bosom sway,"
4166,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Yield to your duties, and their call obey:"
4167,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Fly not a youth, frank, honest, and sincere;"
4168,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Observe his merits, and his passion hear!"
4169,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"’Tis true, no hero, but a farmer sues--"
4170,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Slow in his speech, but worthy in his views;"
4171,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"With him you cannot that affliction prove,"
4172,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,That rends the bosom of the poor in love;
4173,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Health, comfort, competence, and cheerful days,"
4174,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Your friends’ approval, and your father’s praise,        360"
4175,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Will crown the deed, and you escape _their_ fate"
4176,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Who plan so wildly, and are wise too late.”"
4177,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The damsel heard; at first th’ advice was strange,"
4178,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Yet wrought a happy, nay, a speedy change."
4179,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“I have no care,” she said, when next they met,"
4180,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,“But one may wonder he is silent yet;
4181,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"He looks around him with his usual stare,"
4182,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And utters nothing--not that I shall care.”
4183,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,This pettish humour pleased th’ experienced friend--
4184,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"None need despair, whose silence can offend;             370"
4185,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Should I,” resumed the thoughtful lass, “consent"
4186,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"To hear the man, the man may now repent."
4187,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Think you my sighs shall call him from the plough,"
4188,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"Or give one hint, that ‘You may woo me now?’”"
4189,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"“Persist, my love,” replied the friend, “and gain"
4190,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"A parent’s praise, _that_ cannot be in vain.”"
4191,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The father saw the change, but not the cause,"
4192,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And gave the alter’d maid his fond applause.
4193,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The coarser manners she in part removed,"
4194,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"In part endured, improving and improved;                 380"
4195,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"She spoke of household works, she rose betimes,"
4196,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And said neglect and indolence were crimes;
4197,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The various duties of their life she weigh’d,"
4198,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And strict attention to her dairy paid;
4199,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,"The names of servants now familiar grew,"
4200,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,And fair Lucinda’s from her mind withdrew.
4201,_THE WIDOW’S TALE._,As prudent travellers for their ease assume

4382,_THE MOTHER._,"Such harmony in motion, speech, and air,                 100"
4383,_THE MOTHER._,That without fairness she was more than fair;
4384,_THE MOTHER._,"Had more than beauty in each speaking grace,"

4386,_THE MOTHER._,"Where mild good sense in placid looks were shown,"
4387,_THE MOTHER._,And felt in every bosom but her own.
4388,_THE MOTHER._,"The one presiding feature in her mind,"

4391,_THE MOTHER._,"Of wit, and pleased in mild benevolence;"
4392,_THE MOTHER._,"Bless’d in protecting fondness she reposed,              110"

4394,_THE MOTHER._,"But love, like zephyr on the limpid lake,        }"

4400,_THE MOTHER._,"A younger sister, fearless of success."
4401,_THE MOTHER._,"His friends, a lofty race, their native pride"

4404,_THE MOTHER._,They own’d she would adorn the loftiest race.
4405,_THE MOTHER._,"The aunt, a mother’s caution to supply,"
4406,_THE MOTHER._,Had watch’d the youthful priest with jealous eye;
4407,_THE MOTHER._,"And, anxious for her charge, had view’d unseen"

4409,_THE MOTHER._,"In all she found him all she wish’d to find,"
4410,_THE MOTHER._,With slight exception of a lofty mind:
4411,_THE MOTHER._,"A certain manner that express’d desire,"
4412,_THE MOTHER._,To be received as brother to the ’squire.                130
4413,_THE MOTHER._,"Lucy’s meek eye had beam’d with many a tear,"
4414,_THE MOTHER._,"Lucy’s soft heart had beat with many a fear,"
4415,_THE MOTHER._,"Before he told (although his looks, she thought,"
4416,_THE MOTHER._,Had oft confess’d) that he her favour sought;
4417,_THE MOTHER._,"But when he kneel’d, (she wish’d him not to kneel,)"
4418,_THE MOTHER._,And spoke the fears and hopes that lovers feel;
4419,_THE MOTHER._,"When too the prudent aunt herself confess’d,"
4420,_THE MOTHER._,Her wishes on the gentle youth would rest;
4421,_THE MOTHER._,"The maiden’s eye with tender passion beam’d,"
4422,_THE MOTHER._,She dwelt with fondness on the life she schemed--       140
4423,_THE MOTHER._,"The household cares, the soft and lasting ties"
4424,_THE MOTHER._,"Of love, with all his binding charities;"
4425,_THE MOTHER._,"Their village taught, consoled, assisted, fed,"
4426,_THE MOTHER._,Till the young zealot tears of pleasure shed.
4427,_THE MOTHER._,But would her mother? Ah! she fear’d it wrong
4428,_THE MOTHER._,To have indulged these forward hopes so long;
4429,_THE MOTHER._,"Her mother loved, but was not used to grant"
4430,_THE MOTHER._,Favours so freely as her gentle aunt.--
4431,_THE MOTHER._,"Her gentle aunt, with smiles that angels wear,"
4432,_THE MOTHER._,Dispell’d her Lucy’s apprehensive tear:                  150
4433,_THE MOTHER._,Her prudent foresight the request had made
4434,_THE MOTHER._,"To one whom none could govern, few persuade;"
4435,_THE MOTHER._,She doubted much if one in earnest woo’d
4436,_THE MOTHER._,A girl with not a single charm endued;
4437,_THE MOTHER._,"The sister’s nobler views she then declared,"
4438,_THE MOTHER._,And what small sum for Lucy could be spared;
4439,_THE MOTHER._,"“If more than this the foolish priest requires,"
4440,_THE MOTHER._,"Tell him,” she wrote, “to check his vain desires.”"

4442,_THE MOTHER._,"With many a sneer on girls so fondly fix’d,              160"
4443,_THE MOTHER._,"There came a promise--should they not repent,        }"
4444,_THE MOTHER._,"But take with grateful minds the portion meant,      }"
4445,_THE MOTHER._,And wait the sister’s day--the mother might consent. }
4446,_THE MOTHER._,"And here, might pitying hope o’er truth prevail,"
4447,_THE MOTHER._,"Or love o’er fortune, we would end our tale:"
4448,_THE MOTHER._,For who more bless’d than youthful pair removed
4449,_THE MOTHER._,From fear of want--by mutual friends approved--
4450,_THE MOTHER._,"Short time to wait, and in that time to live"
4451,_THE MOTHER._,With all the pleasures hope and fancy give;
4452,_THE MOTHER._,"Their equal passion raised on just esteem,               170"
4453,_THE MOTHER._,When reason sanctions all that love can dream?
4454,_THE MOTHER._,Yes! reason sanctions what stern fate denies:
4455,_THE MOTHER._,"The early prospect in the glory dies,"
4456,_THE MOTHER._,As the soft smiles on dying infants play
4457,_THE MOTHER._,"In their mild features, and then pass away."
4458,_THE MOTHER._,"The beauty died, ere she could yield her hand"
4459,_THE MOTHER._,In the high marriage by the mother plann’d:
4460,_THE MOTHER._,"Who grieved indeed, but found a vast relief"
4461,_THE MOTHER._,"In a cold heart, that ever warr’d with grief."
4462,_THE MOTHER._,"Lucy was present when her sister died,                 180"
4463,_THE MOTHER._,Heiress to duties that she ill supplied:
4464,_THE MOTHER._,"There were no mutual feelings, sister arts,"
4465,_THE MOTHER._,"No kindred taste, nor intercourse of hearts;"
4466,_THE MOTHER._,"When in the mirror play’d the matron’s smile,"
4467,_THE MOTHER._,The maiden’s thoughts were travelling all the while;
4468,_THE MOTHER._,"And, when desired to speak, she sigh’d to find"
4469,_THE MOTHER._,Her pause offended:--“Envy made her blind;
4470,_THE MOTHER._,"Tasteless she was, nor had a claim in life"
4471,_THE MOTHER._,Above the station of a rector’s wife;
4472,_THE MOTHER._,"Yet as an heiress, she must shun disgrace,               190"
4473,_THE MOTHER._,Although no heiress to her mother’s face:
4474,_THE MOTHER._,"It is your duty,” said th’ imperious dame,     }"
4475,_THE MOTHER._,"“(Advanced your fortune) to advance your name, }"
4476,_THE MOTHER._,"And with superior rank, superior offers claim. }"
4477,_THE MOTHER._,"Your sister’s lover, when his sorrows die,"
4478,_THE MOTHER._,"May look upon you, and for favour sigh;"
4479,_THE MOTHER._,Nor can you offer a reluctant hand;
4480,_THE MOTHER._,"His birth is noble, and his seat is grand.”"
4481,_THE MOTHER._,"Alarm’d was Lucy, was in tears--“A fool!"
4482,_THE MOTHER._,Was she a child in love?--a miss at school?              200
4483,_THE MOTHER._,"Doubts any mortal, if a change of state"
4484,_THE MOTHER._,Dissolves all claims and ties of earlier date?”
4485,_THE MOTHER._,"The rector doubted, for he came to mourn"
4486,_THE MOTHER._,"A sister dead, and with a wife return."
4487,_THE MOTHER._,"Lucy with heart unchanged received the youth,"
4488,_THE MOTHER._,"True in herself, confiding in his truth;"
4489,_THE MOTHER._,But own’d her mother’s change: the haughty dame
4490,_THE MOTHER._,Pour’d strong contempt upon the youthful flame;
4491,_THE MOTHER._,"She firmly vow’d her purpose to pursue,"
4492,_THE MOTHER._,"Judged her own cause, and bade the youth adieu!          210"
4493,_THE MOTHER._,"The lover begg’d, insisted, urged his pain;"
4494,_THE MOTHER._,His brother wrote to threaten and complain;
4495,_THE MOTHER._,"Her sister, reasoning, proved the promise made,"
4496,_THE MOTHER._,"Lucy, appealing to a parent, pray’d;"
4497,_THE MOTHER._,"But all opposed th’ event that she design’d,"
4498,_THE MOTHER._,And all in vain--she never changed her mind;
4499,_THE MOTHER._,"But coldly answer’d in her wonted way,"
4500,_THE MOTHER._,"That she “would rule, and Lucy must obey.”"
4501,_THE MOTHER._,"With peevish fear, she saw her health decline,"
4502,_THE MOTHER._,"And cried, “Oh! monstrous, for a man to pine;            220"
4503,_THE MOTHER._,"But if your foolish heart must yield to love,"
4504,_THE MOTHER._,Let him possess it whom I now approve;
4505,_THE MOTHER._,This is my pleasure.”--Still the rector came
4506,_THE MOTHER._,With larger offers and with bolder claim;
4507,_THE MOTHER._,But the stern lady would attend no more--
4508,_THE MOTHER._,"She frown’d, and rudely pointed to the door;"
4509,_THE MOTHER._,"Whate’er he wrote, he saw unread return’d,"
4510,_THE MOTHER._,"And he, indignant, the dishonour spurn’d;"
4511,_THE MOTHER._,"Nay, fix’d suspicion where he might confide,"
4512,_THE MOTHER._,And sacrificed his passion to his pride.                 230
4513,_THE MOTHER._,"Lucy, meantime, though threaten’d and distress’d,"
4514,_THE MOTHER._,Against her marriage made a strong protest.
4515,_THE MOTHER._,All was domestic war: the aunt rebell’d
4516,_THE MOTHER._,"Against the sovereign will, and was expell’d;"
4517,_THE MOTHER._,"And every power was tried and every art,"
4518,_THE MOTHER._,To bend to falsehood one determined heart;
4519,_THE MOTHER._,"Assail’d, in patience it received the shock,"
4520,_THE MOTHER._,"Soft as the wave, unshaken as the rock;"
4521,_THE MOTHER._,But while th’ unconquer’d soul endures the storm
4522,_THE MOTHER._,"Of angry fate, it preys upon the form.                   240"
4523,_THE MOTHER._,"With conscious virtue she resisted still,"
4524,_THE MOTHER._,And conscious love gave vigour to her will;
4525,_THE MOTHER._,But Lucy’s trial was at hand; with joy
4526,_THE MOTHER._,The mother cried--“Behold your constant boy--
4527,_THE MOTHER._,"Thursday--was married--take the paper, sweet,"
4528,_THE MOTHER._,And read the conduct of your reverend cheat;
4529,_THE MOTHER._,"See with what pomp of coaches, in what crowd"
4530,_THE MOTHER._,The creature married--of his falsehood proud!
4531,_THE MOTHER._,"False, did I say?--at least no whining fool;"
4532,_THE MOTHER._,And thus will hopeless passions ever cool:               250
4533,_THE MOTHER._,But shall his bride your single state reproach?
4534,_THE MOTHER._,"No! give him crowd for crowd, and coach for coach."
4535,_THE MOTHER._,"Oh! you retire; reflect then, gentle miss,"
4536,_THE MOTHER._,And gain some spirit in a cause like this.”
4537,_THE MOTHER._,"Some spirit Lucy gain’d; a steady soul,"
4538,_THE MOTHER._,"Defying all persuasion, all control:"
4539,_THE MOTHER._,"In vain reproach, derision, threats were tried;       }"
4540,_THE MOTHER._,"The constant mind all outward force defied,           }"
4541,_THE MOTHER._,"By vengeance vainly urged, in vain assail’d by pride. }"
4542,_THE MOTHER._,"Fix’d in her purpose, perfect in her part,               260"
4543,_THE MOTHER._,She felt the courage of a wounded heart;
4544,_THE MOTHER._,"The world receded from her rising view,"
4545,_THE MOTHER._,When Heaven approach’d as earthly things withdrew;
4546,_THE MOTHER._,"Not strange before, for in the days of love,"
4547,_THE MOTHER._,"Joy, hope, and pleasure, she had thoughts above;"
4548,_THE MOTHER._,"Pious when most of worldly prospects fond,"
4549,_THE MOTHER._,When they best pleased her she could look beyond;
4550,_THE MOTHER._,"Had the young priest a faithful lover died,"
4551,_THE MOTHER._,Something had been her bosom to divide;
4552,_THE MOTHER._,"Now Heaven had all, for in her holiest views             270"
4553,_THE MOTHER._,She saw the matron whom she fear’d to lose;
4554,_THE MOTHER._,While from her parent the dejected maid
4555,_THE MOTHER._,"Forced the unpleasant thought, or thinking pray’d."
4556,_THE MOTHER._,"Surprised, the mother saw the languid frame,"
4557,_THE MOTHER._,"And felt indignant, yet forbore to blame."
4558,_THE MOTHER._,"Once with a frown she cried, “And do you mean"
4559,_THE MOTHER._,To die of love--the folly of fifteen?”
4560,_THE MOTHER._,"But as her anger met with no reply,"
4561,_THE MOTHER._,She let the gentle girl in quiet die;
4562,_THE MOTHER._,"And to her sister wrote, impell’d by pain,               280"
4563,_THE MOTHER._,"“Come quickly, Martha, or you come in vain.”"
4564,_THE MOTHER._,"Lucy meantime profess’d with joy sincere,"
4565,_THE MOTHER._,"That nothing held, employ’d, engaged her here.--"
4566,_THE MOTHER._,"“I am an humble actor, doom’d to play"
4567,_THE MOTHER._,"A part obscure, and then to glide away;"
4568,_THE MOTHER._,"Incurious how the great or happy shine,"
4569,_THE MOTHER._,Or who have parts obscure and sad as mine;
4570,_THE MOTHER._,"In its best prospect I but wish’d, for life,"
4571,_THE MOTHER._,"To be th’ assiduous, gentle, useful wife;"
4572,_THE MOTHER._,"That lost, with wearied mind, and spirit poor,           290"
4573,_THE MOTHER._,"I drop my efforts, and can act no more;"
4574,_THE MOTHER._,With growing joy I feel my spirits tend
4575,_THE MOTHER._,To that last scene where all my duties end.”
4576,_THE MOTHER._,"Hope, ease, delight, the thoughts of dying gave,"
4577,_THE MOTHER._,Till Lucy spoke with fondness of the grave;
4578,_THE MOTHER._,"She smiled with wasted form, but spirit firm,"
4579,_THE MOTHER._,"And said, she left but little for the worm."
4580,_THE MOTHER._,"As toll’d the bell, “There’s one,” she said, “hath press’d"
4581,_THE MOTHER._,Awhile before me to the bed of rest;”
4582,_THE MOTHER._,And she beside her with attention spread                 300
4583,_THE MOTHER._,The decorations of the maiden dead.
4584,_THE MOTHER._,"While quickly thus the mortal part declined,"
4585,_THE MOTHER._,The happiest visions fill’d the active mind;
4586,_THE MOTHER._,"A soft, religious melancholy gain’d"
4587,_THE MOTHER._,"Entire possession, and for ever reign’d;"
4588,_THE MOTHER._,"On holy writ her mind reposing dwelt,"
4589,_THE MOTHER._,"She saw the wonders, she the mercies felt;"
4590,_THE MOTHER._,"Till in a bless’d and glorious reverie,      }"
4591,_THE MOTHER._,"She seem’d the Saviour as on earth to see,   }"
4592,_THE MOTHER._,"And, fill’d with love divine, th’ attending  }"
4593,_THE MOTHER._,friend to be;                       }           310
4594,_THE MOTHER._,"Or she, who trembling, yet confiding, stole"
4595,_THE MOTHER._,"Near to the garment, touch’d it, and was whole;"
4596,_THE MOTHER._,"When, such th’ intenseness of the working thought,"
4597,_THE MOTHER._,On her it seem’d the very deed was wrought;
4598,_THE MOTHER._,"She the glad patient’s fear and rapture found,"
4599,_THE MOTHER._,"The holy transport, and the healing wound;"
4600,_THE MOTHER._,"This was so fix’d, so grafted in the heart,"
4601,_THE MOTHER._,"That she adopted, nay became, the part."
4602,_THE MOTHER._,But one chief scene was present to her sight:
4603,_THE MOTHER._,Her Saviour resting in the tomb by night;                320
4604,_THE MOTHER._,"Her fever rose, and still her wedded mind"
4605,_THE MOTHER._,"Was to that scene, that hallow’d cave, confined--"
4606,_THE MOTHER._,"Where in the shade of death the body laid,"
4607,_THE MOTHER._,There watch’d the spirit of the wandering maid;
4608,_THE MOTHER._,"Her looks were fix’d, entranced, illumed, serene,"
4609,_THE MOTHER._,In the still glory of the midnight scene;
4610,_THE MOTHER._,"There at her Saviour’s feet, in visions bless’d,"
4611,_THE MOTHER._,Th’ enraptured maid a sacred joy possess’d;
4612,_THE MOTHER._,In patience waiting for the first-born ray
4613,_THE MOTHER._,Of that all-glorious and triumphant day.                 330
4614,_THE MOTHER._,"To this idea all her soul she gave,"
4615,_THE MOTHER._,Her mind reposing by the sacred grave;
4616,_THE MOTHER._,"Then sleep would seal the eye, the vision close,"
4617,_THE MOTHER._,And steep the solemn thoughts in brief repose.
4618,_THE MOTHER._,"Then grew the soul serene, and all its powers,"
4619,_THE MOTHER._,Again restored illumed the dying hours;
4620,_THE MOTHER._,"But reason dwelt where fancy stray’d before,"
4621,_THE MOTHER._,And the mind wander’d from its views no more;
4622,_THE MOTHER._,"Till death approach’d, when every look express’d"
4623,_THE MOTHER._,"A sense of bliss, till every sense had rest.             340"
4624,_THE MOTHER._,"The mother lives, and has enough to buy"
4625,_THE MOTHER._,Th’ attentive ear and the submissive eye
4626,_THE MOTHER._,"Of abject natures--these are daily told,"
4627,_THE MOTHER._,How triumph’d beauty in the days of old;
4628,_THE MOTHER._,"How, by her window seated, crowds have cast"
4629,_THE MOTHER._,"Admiring glances, wondering as they pass’d;"
4630,_THE MOTHER._,"How from her carriage as she stepp’d to pray,"
4631,_THE MOTHER._,Divided ranks would humbly make her way;
4632,_THE MOTHER._,And how each voice in the astonish’d throng
4633,_THE MOTHER._,Pronounced her peerless as she moved along.              350
4634,_THE MOTHER._,Her picture then the greedy dame displays;
4635,_THE MOTHER._,"Touch’d by no shame, she now demands its praise;"
4636,_THE MOTHER._,"In her tall mirror then she shows a face,"
4637,_THE MOTHER._,Still coldly fair with unaffecting grace;
4638,_THE MOTHER._,"These she compares: “It has the form,” she cries,"
4639,_THE MOTHER._,"“But wants the air, the spirit, and the eyes;"
4640,_THE MOTHER._,"This, as a likeness, is correct and true,"
4641,_THE MOTHER._,But there alone the living grace we view.”
4642,_THE MOTHER._,"This said, th’ applauding voice the dame required,"
4643,_THE MOTHER._,"And, gazing, slowly from the glass retired.              360"

4672,_ARABELLA._,"Of a fair town, where Doctor Rack was guide,"
4673,_ARABELLA._,His only daughter was the boast and pride;
4674,_ARABELLA._,"Wise Arabella--yet not wise alone,"
4675,_ARABELLA._,She like a bright and polish’d brilliant shone;
4676,_ARABELLA._,"Her father own’d her for his prop and stay,"
4677,_ARABELLA._,"Able to guide, yet willing to obey;"
4678,_ARABELLA._,"Pleased with her learning while discourse could please,"
4679,_ARABELLA._,And with her love in languor and disease.
4680,_ARABELLA._,"To every mother were her virtues known,"

4682,_ARABELLA._,"Who in her youth had all that age requires,"
4683,_ARABELLA._,"And, with her prudence, all that youth admires."
4684,_ARABELLA._,These odious praises made the damsels try
4685,_ARABELLA._,"Not to obtain such merits, but deny;"
4686,_ARABELLA._,"For, whatsoever wise mammas might say,"
4687,_ARABELLA._,To guide a daughter this was not the way;
4688,_ARABELLA._,"From such applause disdain and anger rise,"
4689,_ARABELLA._,And envy lives where emulation dies.

4696,_ARABELLA._,"Not the last novel, not the new-born play;"
4697,_ARABELLA._,Not the mere trash and scandal of the day;
4698,_ARABELLA._,But (though her young companions felt the shock)
4699,_ARABELLA._,"She studied Berkeley, Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke:"
4700,_ARABELLA._,"Her mind within the maze of history dwelt,"
4701,_ARABELLA._,And of the moral muse the beauty felt;                    30
4702,_ARABELLA._,"The merits of the Roman page she knew,"
4703,_ARABELLA._,And could converse with Moore and Montagu:
4704,_ARABELLA._,"Thus she became the wonder of the town,"
4705,_ARABELLA._,"From that she reap’d, to that she gave, renown;"
4706,_ARABELLA._,"And strangers, coming, all were taught t’ admire"
4707,_ARABELLA._,"The learned lady, and the lofty spire."
4708,_ARABELLA._,"Thus fame in public fix’d the maid, where all"
4709,_ARABELLA._,"Might throw their darts, and see the idol fall;"
4710,_ARABELLA._,"A hundred arrows came with vengeance keen,"
4711,_ARABELLA._,"From tongues envenom’d, and from arms unseen;             40"
4712,_ARABELLA._,"A thousand eyes were fix’d upon the place,"
4713,_ARABELLA._,"That, if she fell, she might not fly disgrace."
4714,_ARABELLA._,"But malice vainly throws the poison’d dart,"
4715,_ARABELLA._,Unless our frailty shows the peccant part;

4717,_ARABELLA._,"Untouch’d, and shone with undisputed fame;"
4718,_ARABELLA._,"Her very notice some respect would cause,"
4719,_ARABELLA._,And her esteem was honour and applause.
4720,_ARABELLA._,"Men she avoided--not in childish fear,"
4721,_ARABELLA._,As if she thought some savage foe was near;               50
4722,_ARABELLA._,"Not as a prude, who hides that man should seek,"
4723,_ARABELLA._,Or who by silence hints that they should speak;
4724,_ARABELLA._,"But with discretion all the sex she view’d,"
4725,_ARABELLA._,"Ere yet engaged, pursuing, or pursued;"
4726,_ARABELLA._,"Ere love had made her to his vices blind,"
4727,_ARABELLA._,Or hid the favourite’s failings from her mind.
4728,_ARABELLA._,"Thus was the picture of the man portray’d,"
4729,_ARABELLA._,By merit destined for so rare a maid;
4730,_ARABELLA._,"At whose request she might exchange her state,"
4731,_ARABELLA._,Or still be happy in a virgin’s fate.                     60
4732,_ARABELLA._,"He must be one with manners like her own,"
4733,_ARABELLA._,"His life unquestion’d, his opinions known;"
4734,_ARABELLA._,"His stainless virtue must all tests endure,"
4735,_ARABELLA._,"His honour spotless, and his bosom pure;"
4736,_ARABELLA._,"She no allowance made for sex or times,"
4737,_ARABELLA._,Of lax opinion--crimes were ever crimes;
4738,_ARABELLA._,"No wretch forsaken must his frailty curse,"
4739,_ARABELLA._,No spurious offspring drain his private purse:
4740,_ARABELLA._,"He at all times his passions must command,"
4741,_ARABELLA._,And yet possess--or be refused her hand.                  70
4742,_ARABELLA._,"All this without reserve the maiden told,"
4743,_ARABELLA._,And some began to weigh the rector’s gold;
4744,_ARABELLA._,"To ask what sum a prudent man might gain,"
4745,_ARABELLA._,Who had such store of virtues to maintain?
4746,_ARABELLA._,"A Doctor Campbell, north of Tweed, came forth,"
4747,_ARABELLA._,"Declared his passion, and proclaim’d his worth;"
4748,_ARABELLA._,"Not unapproved, for he had much to say"
4749,_ARABELLA._,"On every cause, and in a pleasant way;"
4750,_ARABELLA._,"Not all his trust was in a pliant tongue,"
4751,_ARABELLA._,"His form was good, and ruddy he, and young.               80"
4752,_ARABELLA._,"But, though the Doctor was a man of parts,"
4753,_ARABELLA._,He read not deeply male or female hearts;
4754,_ARABELLA._,But judged that all whom he esteem’d as wise
4755,_ARABELLA._,"Must think alike, though some assumed disguise;"
4756,_ARABELLA._,"That every reasoning Bramin, Christian, Jew,"
4757,_ARABELLA._,Of all religions took their liberal view;
4758,_ARABELLA._,"And of her own, no doubt, this learned maid"
4759,_ARABELLA._,"Denied the substance, and the forms obey’d;"
4760,_ARABELLA._,"And thus persuaded, he his thoughts express’d"
4761,_ARABELLA._,"Of her opinions, and his own profess’d:                   90"
4762,_ARABELLA._,"“All states demand this aid, the vulgar need"
4763,_ARABELLA._,"Their priests and pray’rs, their sermons and their creed;"
4764,_ARABELLA._,And those of stronger minds should never speak
4765,_ARABELLA._,(In his opinion) what might hurt the weak.
4766,_ARABELLA._,"A man may smile, but still he should attend               }"
4767,_ARABELLA._,"His hour at church, and be the church’s friend,           }"
4768,_ARABELLA._,"What there he thinks conceal, and what he hears commend.” }"
4769,_ARABELLA._,"Frank was the speech, but heard with high disdain,"
4770,_ARABELLA._,Nor had the Doctor leave to speak again;
4771,_ARABELLA._,"A man who own’d, nay gloried in deceit,                  100"
4772,_ARABELLA._,"“He might despise her, but he should not cheat.”"
4773,_ARABELLA._,Then Vicar Holmes appear’d; he heard it said
4774,_ARABELLA._,That ancient men best pleased the prudent maid;
4775,_ARABELLA._,And true it was her ancient friends she loved;
4776,_ARABELLA._,Servants when old she favour’d and approved;
4777,_ARABELLA._,"Age in her pious parents she revered,"
4778,_ARABELLA._,And neighbours were by length of days endear’d;
4779,_ARABELLA._,"But, if her husband too must ancient be,"
4780,_ARABELLA._,The good old Vicar found it was not he.
4781,_ARABELLA._,On Captain Bligh her mind in balance hung--           110
4782,_ARABELLA._,"Though valiant, modest; and reserved, though young:"
4783,_ARABELLA._,Against these merits must defects be set--
4784,_ARABELLA._,"Though poor, imprudent; and though proud, in debt:"
4785,_ARABELLA._,In vain the Captain close attention paid;
4786,_ARABELLA._,"She found him wanting, whom she fairly weigh’d."
4787,_ARABELLA._,"Then came a youth, and all their friends agreed,"
4788,_ARABELLA._,That Edward Huntly was the man indeed;
4789,_ARABELLA._,"Respectful duty he had paid awhile,"
4790,_ARABELLA._,"Then ask’d her hand, and had a gracious smile:"
4791,_ARABELLA._,"A lover now declared, he led the fair                    120"
4792,_ARABELLA._,"To woods and fields, to visits and to pray’r;"
4793,_ARABELLA._,Then whisper’d softly--“Will you name the day?”
4794,_ARABELLA._,"She softly whisper’d--“If you love me, stay.”--"
4795,_ARABELLA._,"“Oh! try me not beyond my strength,” he cried;--"
4796,_ARABELLA._,"“Oh! be not weak,” the prudent maid replied;"
4797,_ARABELLA._,“But by some trial your affection prove--
4798,_ARABELLA._,Respect and not impatience argues love;
4799,_ARABELLA._,"And love no more is by impatience known,"
4800,_ARABELLA._,Than Ocean’s depth is by its tempests shown.
4801,_ARABELLA._,"He whom a weak and fond impatience sways,         }      130"
4802,_ARABELLA._,"But for himself with all his fervour prays,       }"
4803,_ARABELLA._,"And not the maid he woos, but his own will obeys; }"
4804,_ARABELLA._,"And will she love the being who prefers,"
4805,_ARABELLA._,"With so much ardour, his desire to hers?”"
4806,_ARABELLA._,"Young Edward grieved, but let not grief be seen;"
4807,_ARABELLA._,He knew obedience pleased his fancy’s queen:
4808,_ARABELLA._,"Awhile he waited, and then cried--“Behold!"
4809,_ARABELLA._,"The year advancing, be no longer cold!”"
4810,_ARABELLA._,"For she had promised--“Let the flowers appear,"
4811,_ARABELLA._,And I will pass with thee the smiling year.”             140
4812,_ARABELLA._,"Then pressing grew the youth; the more he press’d,"
4813,_ARABELLA._,The less inclined the maid to his request:
4814,_ARABELLA._,"“Let June arrive.”--Alas! when April came,"
4815,_ARABELLA._,"It brought a stranger, and the stranger, shame;"
4816,_ARABELLA._,Nor could the lover from his house persuade
4817,_ARABELLA._,A stubborn lass whom he had mournful made;
4818,_ARABELLA._,"Angry and weak, by thoughtless vengeance moved,"
4819,_ARABELLA._,She told her story to the fair beloved;
4820,_ARABELLA._,"In strongest words th’ unwelcome truth was shown,"
4821,_ARABELLA._,"To blight his prospects, careless of her own.            150"
4822,_ARABELLA._,"Our heroine grieved, but had too firm a heart"
4823,_ARABELLA._,"For him to soften, when she swore to part;"
4824,_ARABELLA._,"In vain his seeming penitence and pray’r,"
4825,_ARABELLA._,"His vows, his tears: she left him in despair."
4826,_ARABELLA._,"His mother fondly laid her grief aside,"
4827,_ARABELLA._,And to the reason of the nymph applied--
4828,_ARABELLA._,"“It well becomes thee, lady, to appear,"
4829,_ARABELLA._,"But not to be, in very truth, severe;"
4830,_ARABELLA._,"Although the crime be odious in thy sight,"
4831,_ARABELLA._,That daring sex is taught such things to slight:         160
4832,_ARABELLA._,"His heart is thine, although it once was frail;"
4833,_ARABELLA._,"Think of his grief, and let his love prevail!--”"
4834,_ARABELLA._,"“Plead thou no more,” the lofty lass return’d;"
4835,_ARABELLA._,“Forgiving woman is deceived and spurn’d.
4836,_ARABELLA._,Say that the crime is common--shall I take
4837,_ARABELLA._,A common man my wedded lord to make?
4838,_ARABELLA._,"See! a weak woman by his arts betray’d,"
4839,_ARABELLA._,An infant born his father to upbraid;
4840,_ARABELLA._,"Shall I forgive his vileness, take his name,"
4841,_ARABELLA._,"Sanction his error, and partake his shame?               170"
4842,_ARABELLA._,"No! this assent would kindred frailty prove,"
4843,_ARABELLA._,A love for him would be a vicious love:
4844,_ARABELLA._,Can a chaste maiden secret counsel hold
4845,_ARABELLA._,With one whose crime by every mouth is told?
4846,_ARABELLA._,"Forbid it spirit, prudence, virtuous pride;"

4850,_ARABELLA._,"And show, by scorning them, a just contempt for sin.” }"
4851,_ARABELLA._,"The youth, repulsed, to one more mild convey’d         180"
4852,_ARABELLA._,"His heart, and smiled on the remorseless maid;"
4853,_ARABELLA._,"The maid, remorseless in her pride, the while"
4854,_ARABELLA._,"Despised the insult, and return’d the smile."
4855,_ARABELLA._,"First to admire, to praise her, and defend,"
4856,_ARABELLA._,Was (now in years advanced) a virgin friend:
4857,_ARABELLA._,"Much she preferr’d, she cried, a single state,"
4858,_ARABELLA._,“It was her choice”--it surely was her fate;
4859,_ARABELLA._,And much it pleased her in the train to view
4860,_ARABELLA._,"A maiden vot’ress, wise and lovely too."
4861,_ARABELLA._,"Time to the yielding mind his change imparts,          190"
4862,_ARABELLA._,"He varies notions, and he alters hearts;"
4863,_ARABELLA._,"’Tis right, ’tis just to feel contempt for vice,"
4864,_ARABELLA._,But he that shows it may be over-nice:
4865,_ARABELLA._,"There are who feel, when young, the false sublime,"
4866,_ARABELLA._,And proudly love to show disdain for crime;
4867,_ARABELLA._,"To whom the future will new thoughts supply,"
4868,_ARABELLA._,"The pride will soften, and the scorn will die;"
4869,_ARABELLA._,"Nay, where they still the vice itself condemn,"
4870,_ARABELLA._,"They bear the vicious, and consort with them."
4871,_ARABELLA._,"Young Captain Grove, when one had changed his side,      200"
4872,_ARABELLA._,"Despised the venal turn-coat, and defied;"
4873,_ARABELLA._,"Old Colonel Grove now shakes him by the hand,"
4874,_ARABELLA._,Though he who bribes may still his vote command.
4875,_ARABELLA._,"Why would not Ellen to Belinda speak,"
4876,_ARABELLA._,"When she had flown to London for a week,"
4877,_ARABELLA._,"And then return’d, to every friend’s surprise,"
4878,_ARABELLA._,"With twice the spirit, and with half the size?"
4879,_ARABELLA._,"She spoke not then--but, after years had flown,"
4880,_ARABELLA._,A better friend had Ellen never known:
4881,_ARABELLA._,Was it the lady her mistake had seen?                    210
4882,_ARABELLA._,Or had she also such a journey been?
4883,_ARABELLA._,"No: ’twas the gradual change in human hearts,"
4884,_ARABELLA._,"That time, in commerce with the world, imparts;"
4885,_ARABELLA._,"That on the roughest temper throws disguise,"
4886,_ARABELLA._,And steals from virtue her asperities.
4887,_ARABELLA._,"The young and ardent, who with glowing zeal"
4888,_ARABELLA._,"Felt wrath for trifles, and were proud to feel,"
4889,_ARABELLA._,"Now find those trifles all the mind engage,"
4890,_ARABELLA._,"To soothe dull hours, and cheat the cares of age;"
4891,_ARABELLA._,"As young Zelinda, in her quaker-dress,                   220"
4892,_ARABELLA._,"Disdain’d each varying fashion’s vile excess,"
4893,_ARABELLA._,"And now her friends on old Zelinda gaze,"
4894,_ARABELLA._,Pleased in rich silks and orient gems to blaze.
4895,_ARABELLA._,"Changes like these ’tis folly to condemn,"
4896,_ARABELLA._,"So virtue yields not, nor is changed with them."
4897,_ARABELLA._,"Let us proceed:--Twelve brilliant years were past,"
4898,_ARABELLA._,Yet each with less of glory than the last;
4899,_ARABELLA._,Whether these years to this fair virgin gave
4900,_ARABELLA._,A softer mind--effect they often have;
4901,_ARABELLA._,Whether the virgin-state was not so bless’d              230
4902,_ARABELLA._,As that good maiden in her zeal profess’d;
4903,_ARABELLA._,"Or whether lovers falling from her train,"
4904,_ARABELLA._,"Gave greater price to those she could retain,"
4905,_ARABELLA._,Is all unknown;--but Arabella now
4906,_ARABELLA._,Was kindly listening to a merchant’s vow;
4907,_ARABELLA._,"Who offer’d terms so fair, against his love"
4908,_ARABELLA._,To strive was folly; so she never strove.--
4909,_ARABELLA._,Man in his earlier days we often find
4910,_ARABELLA._,With a too easy and unguarded mind;
4911,_ARABELLA._,"But, by increasing years and prudence taught,            240"
4912,_ARABELLA._,"He grows reserved, and locks up every thought."
4913,_ARABELLA._,"Not thus the maiden, for in blooming youth"
4914,_ARABELLA._,"She hides her thought, and guards the tender truth;"
4915,_ARABELLA._,"This, when no longer young, no more she hides,"
4916,_ARABELLA._,But frankly in the favour’d swain confides.
4917,_ARABELLA._,"Man, stubborn man, is like the growing tree,"
4918,_ARABELLA._,"That longer standing, still will harder be;"
4919,_ARABELLA._,"And like its fruit the virgin, first austere,"
4920,_ARABELLA._,Then kindly softening with the ripening year.
4921,_ARABELLA._,"Now was the lover urgent, and the kind                 250"
4922,_ARABELLA._,And yielding lady to his suit inclined:
4923,_ARABELLA._,"“A little time, my friend, is just, is right;"
4924,_ARABELLA._,We must be decent in our neighbours’ sight:”
4925,_ARABELLA._,"Still she allow’d him of his hopes to speak,"
4926,_ARABELLA._,And in compassion took off week by week;
4927,_ARABELLA._,"Till few remain’d, when, wearied with delay,"
4928,_ARABELLA._,She kindly meant to take off day by day.
4929,_ARABELLA._,That female friend who gave our virgin praise
4930,_ARABELLA._,"For flying man and all his treacherous ways,"
4931,_ARABELLA._,"Now heard with mingled anger, shame and fear,            260"
4932,_ARABELLA._,"Of one accepted, and a wedding near;"
4933,_ARABELLA._,But she resolved again with friendly zeal
4934,_ARABELLA._,To make the maid her scorn of wedlock feel;
4935,_ARABELLA._,"For she was grieved to find her work undone,"
4936,_ARABELLA._,And like a sister mourn’d the failing nun.
4937,_ARABELLA._,Why are these gentle maidens prone to make
4938,_ARABELLA._,Their sister-doves the tempting world forsake?
4939,_ARABELLA._,Why all their triumph when a maid disdains
4940,_ARABELLA._,"The tyrant-sex, and scorns to wear its chains?"
4941,_ARABELLA._,Is it pure joy to see a sister flown                     270
4942,_ARABELLA._,From the false pleasures they themselves have known?
4943,_ARABELLA._,"Or do they, as the call-birds in the cage,"
4944,_ARABELLA._,"Try, in pure envy, others to engage;"
4945,_ARABELLA._,"And therefore paint their native woods and groves,"
4946,_ARABELLA._,As scenes of dangerous joys and naughty loves?
4947,_ARABELLA._,"Strong was the maiden’s hope; her friend was proud,"
4948,_ARABELLA._,And had her notions to the world avow’d;
4949,_ARABELLA._,"And, could she find the Merchant weak and frail,"
4950,_ARABELLA._,"With power to prove it, then she must prevail;"
4951,_ARABELLA._,"For she aloud would publish his disgrace,                280"
4952,_ARABELLA._,And save his victim from a man so base.
4953,_ARABELLA._,"When all inquiries had been duly made,"
4954,_ARABELLA._,Came the kind friend her burthen to unlade:--
4955,_ARABELLA._,“Alas! my dear! not all our care and art
4956,_ARABELLA._,Can tread the maze of man’s deceitful heart:
4957,_ARABELLA._,Look not surprise--nor let resentment swell
4958,_ARABELLA._,"Those lovely features, all will yet be well;"
4959,_ARABELLA._,"And thou, from love’s and man’s deceptions free,"
4960,_ARABELLA._,"Wilt dwell in virgin-state, and walk to heav’n with me.”"
4961,_ARABELLA._,"The maiden frown’d, and then conceived “that wives     290"
4962,_ARABELLA._,"Could walk as well, and lead as holy lives"
4963,_ARABELLA._,"As angry prudes who scorn’d the marriage-chain,"
4964,_ARABELLA._,Or luckless maids who sought it still in vain.”
4965,_ARABELLA._,"The friend was vex’d--she paused, at length she cried:"
4966,_ARABELLA._,"“Know your own danger, then your lot decide;"
4967,_ARABELLA._,"That traitor Beswell, while he seeks your hand,"
4968,_ARABELLA._,"Has, I affirm, a wanton at command;"
4969,_ARABELLA._,"A slave, a creature from a foreign place,"
4970,_ARABELLA._,The nurse and mother of a spurious race;
4971,_ARABELLA._,"Brown, ugly bastards--(Heaven the word forgive,          300"
4972,_ARABELLA._,And the deed punish!)--in his cottage live;
4973,_ARABELLA._,"To town if business calls him, there he stays"
4974,_ARABELLA._,In sinful pleasures wasting countless days;
4975,_ARABELLA._,"Nor doubt the facts, for I can witness call"
4976,_ARABELLA._,"For every crime, and prove them one and all.”"
4977,_ARABELLA._,Here ceased th’ informer; Arabella’s look
4978,_ARABELLA._,Was like a school-boy’s puzzled by his book;
4979,_ARABELLA._,"Intent she cast her eyes upon the floor,"
4980,_ARABELLA._,Paused--then replied--
4981,_ARABELLA._,“I wish to know no more:
4982,_ARABELLA._,"I question not your motive, zeal, or love,               310"
4983,_ARABELLA._,But must decline such dubious points to prove.--
4984,_ARABELLA._,"All is not true, I judge, for who can guess"
4985,_ARABELLA._,Those deeds of darkness men with care suppress?
4986,_ARABELLA._,"He brought a slave perhaps to England’s coast,"
4987,_ARABELLA._,And made her free; it is our country’s boast!
4988,_ARABELLA._,And she perchance too grateful--good and ill
4989,_ARABELLA._,"Were sown at first, and grow together still;"
4990,_ARABELLA._,"The colour’d infants on the village-green,"
4991,_ARABELLA._,What are they more than we have often seen?
4992,_ARABELLA._,"Children half-clothed who round their village stray, }   320"
4993,_ARABELLA._,"In sun or rain, now starved, now beaten, they        }"
4994,_ARABELLA._,Will the dark colour of their fate betray;           }
4995,_ARABELLA._,"Let us in Christian love for all account,"
4996,_ARABELLA._,And then behold to what such tales amount.”
4997,_ARABELLA._,"“His heart is evil,” said th’ impatient friend--"
4998,_ARABELLA._,"“My duty bids me try that heart to mend,”"
4999,_ARABELLA._,"Replied the virgin--“We may be too nice,"
5000,_ARABELLA._,And lose a soul in our contempt of vice;
5001,_ARABELLA._,"If false the charge, I then shall show regard"
5002,_ARABELLA._,"For a good man, and be his just reward;                  330"
5003,_ARABELLA._,And what for virtue can I better do
5004,_ARABELLA._,"Than to reclaim him, if the charge be true?”"
5005,_ARABELLA._,"She spoke, nor more her holy work delay’d;"
5006,_ARABELLA._,’Twas time to lend an erring mortal aid:
5007,_ARABELLA._,"“The noblest way,” she judged, “a soul to win,           }"
5008,_ARABELLA._,"Was with an act of kindness to begin,                    }"
5009,_ARABELLA._,"To make the sinner sure, and then t’ attack the sin[5].” }"
5010,_ARABELLA._,
5011,_ARABELLA._,"[5] As the author’s purpose in this Tale may be mistaken, he wishes"
5012,_ARABELLA._,"to observe, that conduct like that of the lady’s here described must"
5013,_ARABELLA._,be meritorious or censurable just as the motives to it are pure or
5014,_ARABELLA._,selfish; that these motives may in a great measure be concealed from
5015,_ARABELLA._,the mind of the agent; and that we often take credit to our virtue
5016,_ARABELLA._,"for actions which spring originally from our tempers, inclinations,"
5017,_ARABELLA._,"or our indifference. It cannot therefore be improper, much less"
5018,_ARABELLA._,"immoral, to give an instance of such self-deception."

5203,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"Sudden a look of languor he descries,"
5204,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,And well-feign’d apprehension in her eyes;
5205,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"Train’d but yet savage, in her speaking face"
5206,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,He mark’d the features of her vagrant race;
5207,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,When a light laugh and roguish leer express’d
5208,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,The vice implanted in her youthful breast.

5221,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,Of vigour palsied and of beauty stain’d;
5222,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,Her bloodshot eyes on her unheeding mate
5223,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"Were wrathful turn’d, and seem’d her wants to state,"
5224,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,Cursing his tardy aid--her mother there
5225,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,With gipsy-state engross’d the only chair;
5226,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"Solemn and dull her look; with such she stands,"
5227,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"And reads the milk-maid’s fortune in her hands,"

5291,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"On either side the rural mansions stood,                 }"
5292,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"With hedge-row trees, and hills high-crown’d with wood,  }"

5321,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"Th’ attended children, there indulged to stray,"
5322,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,Enjoy’d and gave new beauty to the day;
5323,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,Whose happy parents from their room were seen
5324,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,Pleased with the sportive idlers on the green.
5325,_THE LOVER’S JOURNEY._,"“Well!” said Orlando, “and for one so bless’d,        }"

5461,_EDWARD SHORE._,
5462,_EDWARD SHORE._,Genius! thou gift of Heav’n! thou light divine!
5463,_EDWARD SHORE._,Amid what dangers art thou doom’d to shine!
5464,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Oft will the body’s weakness check thy force,"
5465,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Oft damp thy vigour, and impede thy course;"
5466,_EDWARD SHORE._,And trembling nerves compel thee to restrain
5467,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Thy nobler efforts, to contend with pain;"
5468,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Or Want (sad guest!) will in thy presence come,"
5469,_EDWARD SHORE._,And breathe around her melancholy gloom;
5470,_EDWARD SHORE._,"To life’s low cares will thy proud thought confine,"
5471,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And make her sufferings, her impatience, thine.           10"
5472,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Evil and strong, seducing passions prey"
5473,_EDWARD SHORE._,"On soaring minds, and win them from their way;"
5474,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Who then to vice the subject spirits give,"
5475,_EDWARD SHORE._,And in the service of the conqu’ror live;
5476,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Like captive Samson making sport for all,"
5477,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Who fear’d their strength, and glory in their fall."
5478,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Genius, with virtue, still may lack the aid"
5479,_EDWARD SHORE._,Implored by humble minds and hearts afraid;
5480,_EDWARD SHORE._,May leave to timid souls the shield and sword
5481,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of the tried faith, and the resistless word;              20"
5482,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Amid a world of dangers venturing forth,"
5483,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Frail, but yet fearless, proud in conscious worth,"
5484,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Till strong temptation, in some fatal time,"
5485,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Assails the heart, and wins the soul to crime;"
5486,_EDWARD SHORE._,"When, left by honour, and by sorrow spent,"
5487,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Unused to pray, unable to repent,"
5488,_EDWARD SHORE._,The nobler powers that once exalted high
5489,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Th’ aspiring man, shall then degraded lie:"
5490,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Reason, through anguish, shall her throne forsake,"
5491,_EDWARD SHORE._,And strength of mind but stronger madness make.           30
5492,_EDWARD SHORE._,"When EDWARD SHORE had reach’d his twentieth year,"
5493,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He felt his bosom light, his conscience clear;"
5494,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Applause at school the youthful hero gain’d,"
5495,_EDWARD SHORE._,And trials there with manly strength sustain’d;
5496,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With prospects bright upon the world he came,"
5497,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Pure love of virtue, strong desire of fame;"
5498,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Men watch’d the way his lofty mind would take,"
5499,_EDWARD SHORE._,And all foretold the progress he would make.
5500,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Boast of these friends, to older men a guide,"
5501,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Proud of his parts, but gracious in his pride;            40"
5502,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He bore a gay good-nature in his face,"
5503,_EDWARD SHORE._,And in his air were dignity and grace;
5504,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Dress that became his state and years he wore,"
5505,_EDWARD SHORE._,And sense and spirit shone in Edward Shore.
5506,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Thus while admiring friends the youth beheld,"
5507,_EDWARD SHORE._,His own disgust their forward hopes repell’d;
5508,_EDWARD SHORE._,"For he unfix’d, unfixing, look’d around,"
5509,_EDWARD SHORE._,And no employment but in seeking found;
5510,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He gave his restless thoughts to views refined,"
5511,_EDWARD SHORE._,And shrank from worldly cares with wounded mind.          50
5512,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Rejecting trade, awhile he dwelt on laws,"
5513,_EDWARD SHORE._,"“But who could plead, if unapproved the cause?”"
5514,_EDWARD SHORE._,"A doubting, dismal tribe physicians seem’d;"
5515,_EDWARD SHORE._,Divines o’er texts and disputations dream’d;
5516,_EDWARD SHORE._,"War and its glory he perhaps could love,"
5517,_EDWARD SHORE._,But there again he must the cause approve.
5518,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Our hero thought no deed should gain applause,"
5519,_EDWARD SHORE._,Where timid virtue found support in laws;
5520,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He to all good would soar, would fly all sin,"
5521,_EDWARD SHORE._,By the pure prompting of the will within;                60
5522,_EDWARD SHORE._,"“Who needs a law that binds him not to steal,”"
5523,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Ask’d the young teacher, “can he rightly feel?"
5524,_EDWARD SHORE._,"To curb the will, or arm in honour’s cause,"
5525,_EDWARD SHORE._,Or aid the weak--are these enforced by laws?
5526,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Should we a foul, ungenerous action dread,"
5527,_EDWARD SHORE._,Because a law condemns th’ adulterous bed?
5528,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Or fly pollution, not for fear of stain,"
5529,_EDWARD SHORE._,But that some statute tells us to refrain?
5530,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The grosser herd in ties like these we bind,"
5531,_EDWARD SHORE._,In virtue’s freedom moves th’ enlighten’d mind.”          70
5532,_EDWARD SHORE._,"“Man’s heart deceives him,” said a friend. “Of course,”"
5533,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Replied the youth, “but, has it power to force?"
5534,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Unless it forces, call it as you will,"
5535,_EDWARD SHORE._,"It is but wish, and proneness to the ill.”"
5536,_EDWARD SHORE._,“Art thou not tempted?” “Do I fall?” said Shore:
5537,_EDWARD SHORE._,“The pure have fallen.”--“Then are pure no more.
5538,_EDWARD SHORE._,"While reason guides me, I shall walk aright,"
5539,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Nor need a steadier hand, or stronger light;"
5540,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Nor this in dread of awful threats, design’d"
5541,_EDWARD SHORE._,"For the weak spirit and the grov’ling mind,               80"
5542,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But that, engaged by thoughts and views sublime,"
5543,_EDWARD SHORE._,I wage free war with grossness and with crime.”
5544,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Thus look’d he proudly on the vulgar crew,"
5545,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Whom statutes govern, and whom fears subdue."
5546,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Faith, with his virtue, he indeed profess’d,"
5547,_EDWARD SHORE._,But doubts deprived his ardent mind of rest;
5548,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Reason, his sovereign mistress, fail’d to show"
5549,_EDWARD SHORE._,Light through the mazes of the world below;
5550,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Questions arose, and they surpass’d the skill"
5551,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of his sole aid, and would be dubious still;              90"
5552,_EDWARD SHORE._,"These to discuss he sought no common guide,"
5553,_EDWARD SHORE._,But to the doubters in his doubts applied;
5554,_EDWARD SHORE._,"When all together might in freedom speak,"
5555,_EDWARD SHORE._,And their loved truth with mutual ardour seek.
5556,_EDWARD SHORE._,Alas! though men who feel their eyes decay
5557,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Take more than common pains to find their way,"
5558,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Yet, when for this they ask each other’s aid,"
5559,_EDWARD SHORE._,Their mutual purpose is the more delay’d:
5560,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of all their doubts, their reasoning clear’d not one,"
5561,_EDWARD SHORE._,Still the same spots were present in the sun;            100
5562,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Still the same scruples haunted Edward’s mind,"
5563,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Who found no rest, nor took the means to find."
5564,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But though with shaken faith, and slave to fame,"
5565,_EDWARD SHORE._,Vain and aspiring on the world he came;
5566,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Yet was he studious, serious, moral, grave,"
5567,_EDWARD SHORE._,"No passion’s victim, and no system’s slave;"
5568,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Vice he opposed, indulgence he disdain’d,"
5569,_EDWARD SHORE._,And o’er each sense in conscious triumph reign’d.
5570,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Who often reads, will sometimes wish to write,"
5571,_EDWARD SHORE._,And Shore would yield instruction and delight:           110
5572,_EDWARD SHORE._,"A serious drama he design’d, but found"
5573,_EDWARD SHORE._,’Twas tedious travelling in that gloomy ground;
5574,_EDWARD SHORE._,"A deep and solemn story he would try,"
5575,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But grew ashamed of ghosts, and laid it by;"
5576,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Sermons he wrote, but they who knew his creed,"
5577,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Or knew it not, were ill disposed to read;"
5578,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And he would lastly be the nation’s guide,"
5579,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But, studying, fail’d to fix upon a side;"
5580,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Fame he desired, and talents he possess’d,"
5581,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But loved not labour, though he could not rest,          120"
5582,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Nor firmly fix the vacillating mind,"
5583,_EDWARD SHORE._,"That, ever working, could no centre find."
5584,_EDWARD SHORE._,’Tis thus a sanguine reader loves to trace
5585,_EDWARD SHORE._,The Nile forth rushing on his glorious race;
5586,_EDWARD SHORE._,Calm and secure the fancied traveller goes
5587,_EDWARD SHORE._,Through sterile deserts and by threat’ning foes;
5588,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He thinks not then of Afric’s scorching sands,"
5589,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Th’ Arabian sea, the Abyssinian bands;"
5590,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Fasils[7] and Michaels, and the robbers all,"
5591,_EDWARD SHORE._,Whom we politely chiefs and heroes call:                 130
5592,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He of success alone delights to think,              }"
5593,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He views that fount, he stands upon the brink,      }"
5594,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And drinks a fancied draught, exulting so to drink. }"
5595,_EDWARD SHORE._,"In his own room, and with his books around,"
5596,_EDWARD SHORE._,His lively mind its chief employment found;
5597,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then idly busy, quietly employ’d,"
5598,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And, lost to life, his visions were enjoy’d;"
5599,_EDWARD SHORE._,Yet still he took a keen inquiring view
5600,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of all that crowds neglect, desire, pursue;"
5601,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And thus abstracted, curious, still, serene,             140"
5602,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He, unemploy’d, beheld life’s shifting scene;"
5603,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Still more averse from vulgar joys and cares,"
5604,_EDWARD SHORE._,Still more unfitted for the world’s affairs.
5605,_EDWARD SHORE._,"There was a house where Edward oft-times went,"
5606,_EDWARD SHORE._,And social hours in pleasant trifling spent;
5607,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He read, conversed and reason’d, sang and play’d,"
5608,_EDWARD SHORE._,And all were happy while the idler stay’d;
5609,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Too happy one, for thence arose the pain,"
5610,_EDWARD SHORE._,Till this engaging trifler came again.
5611,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But did he love? We answer, day by day,                150"
5612,_EDWARD SHORE._,The loving feet would take th’ accustom’d way;
5613,_EDWARD SHORE._,The amorous eye would rove as if in quest
5614,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of something rare, and on the mansion rest;"
5615,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The same soft passion touch’d the gentle tongue,"
5616,_EDWARD SHORE._,And Anna’s charms in tender notes were sung;
5617,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The ear too seem’d to feel the common flame,"
5618,_EDWARD SHORE._,Sooth’d and delighted with the fair one’s name;
5619,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And thus as love each other part possess’d,"
5620,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The heart, no doubt, its sovereign power confess’d."
5621,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Pleased in her sight, the youth required no more;      160"
5622,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Not rich himself, he saw the damsel poor;"
5623,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And he too wisely, nay, too kindly loved,"
5624,_EDWARD SHORE._,To pain the being whom his soul approved.
5625,_EDWARD SHORE._,"A serious friend our cautious youth possess’d,"
5626,_EDWARD SHORE._,And at his table sat a welcome guest;
5627,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Both unemploy’d, it was their chief delight"
5628,_EDWARD SHORE._,To read what free and daring authors write;
5629,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Authors who loved from common views to soar,"
5630,_EDWARD SHORE._,And seek the fountains never traced before;
5631,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Truth they profess’d, yet often left the true            170"
5632,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And beaten prospect, for the wild and new."
5633,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His chosen friend his fiftieth year had seen,"
5634,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His fortune easy, and his air serene;"
5635,_EDWARD SHORE._,Deist and atheist call’d; for few agreed
5636,_EDWARD SHORE._,"What were his notions, principles, or creed;"
5637,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His mind reposed not, for he hated rest,"
5638,_EDWARD SHORE._,But all things made a query or a jest;
5639,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Perplex’d himself, he ever sought to prove"
5640,_EDWARD SHORE._,That man is doom’d in endless doubt to rove;
5641,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Himself in darkness he profess’d to be,                  180"
5642,_EDWARD SHORE._,And would maintain that not a man could see.
5643,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The youthful friend, dissentient, reason’d still"
5644,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of the soul’s prowess, and the subject will;"
5645,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of virtue’s beauty, and of honour’s force,"
5646,_EDWARD SHORE._,And a warm zeal gave life to his discourse;
5647,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Since from his feelings all his fire arose,"
5648,_EDWARD SHORE._,And he had interest in the themes he chose.
5649,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The friend, indulging a sarcastic smile,"
5650,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Said--“Dear enthusiast! thou wilt change thy style,"
5651,_EDWARD SHORE._,"When man’s delusions, errors, crimes, deceit,            190"
5652,_EDWARD SHORE._,"No more distress thee, and no longer cheat.”"
5653,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Yet lo! this cautious man, so coolly wise,"
5654,_EDWARD SHORE._,On a young beauty fix’d unguarded eyes;
5655,_EDWARD SHORE._,And her he married. Edward at the view
5656,_EDWARD SHORE._,Bade to his cheerful visits long adieu;
5657,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But haply err’d, for this engaging bride"
5658,_EDWARD SHORE._,"No mirth suppress’d, but rather cause supplied;"
5659,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And, when she saw the friends, by reasoning long,"
5660,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Confused if right, and positive if wrong,"
5661,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With playful speech and smile, that spoke delight,       200"
5662,_EDWARD SHORE._,She made them careless both of wrong and right.
5663,_EDWARD SHORE._,"This gentle damsel gave consent to wed,"
5664,_EDWARD SHORE._,With school and school-day dinners in her head:
5665,_EDWARD SHORE._,"She now was promised choice of daintiest food,"
5666,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And costly dress, that made her sovereign good;"
5667,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With walks on hilly heath to banish spleen,"
5668,_EDWARD SHORE._,And summer-visits when the roads were clean.
5669,_EDWARD SHORE._,"All these she loved, to these she gave consent,"
5670,_EDWARD SHORE._,And she was married to her heart’s content.
5671,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Their manner this--the friends together read,          210"
5672,_EDWARD SHORE._,Till books a cause for disputation bred;
5673,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Debate then follow’d, and the vapour’d child"
5674,_EDWARD SHORE._,Declared they argued till her head was wild;
5675,_EDWARD SHORE._,And strange to her it was that mortal brain
5676,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Could seek the trial, or endure the pain."
5677,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then, as the friend reposed, the younger pair"
5678,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Sat down to cards, and play’d beside his chair;"
5679,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Till he, awaking, to his books applied,"
5680,_EDWARD SHORE._,Or heard the music of th’ obedient bride.
5681,_EDWARD SHORE._,"If mild the evening, in the fields they stray’d,         220"
5682,_EDWARD SHORE._,And their own flock with partial eye survey’d;
5683,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But oft the husband, to indulgence prone,"
5684,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Resumed his book, and bade them walk alone."
5685,_EDWARD SHORE._,"“Do, my kind Edward! I must take mine ease,"
5686,_EDWARD SHORE._,Name the dear girl the planets and the trees;
5687,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Tell her what warblers pour their evening song,"
5688,_EDWARD SHORE._,"What insects flutter, as you walk along;"
5689,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Teach her to fix the roving thoughts, to bind"
5690,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The wandering sense, and methodize the mind.”"
5691,_EDWARD SHORE._,"This was obey’d; and oft when this was done,           230"
5692,_EDWARD SHORE._,They calmly gazed on the declining sun;
5693,_EDWARD SHORE._,"In silence saw the glowing landscape fade,"
5694,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Or, sitting, sang beneath the arbour’s shade:"
5695,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Till rose the moon, and on each youthful face"
5696,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Shed a soft beauty, and a dangerous grace."
5697,_EDWARD SHORE._,When the young wife beheld in long debate
5698,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The friends, all careless as she seeming sate;"
5699,_EDWARD SHORE._,"It soon appear’d, there was in one combined"
5700,_EDWARD SHORE._,The nobler person and the richer mind:
5701,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He wore no wig, no grisly beard was seen,                240"
5702,_EDWARD SHORE._,And none beheld him careless or unclean;
5703,_EDWARD SHORE._,Or watch’d him sleeping--we indeed have heard
5704,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of sleeping beauty, and it has appear’d;"
5705,_EDWARD SHORE._,’Tis seen in infants; there indeed we find
5706,_EDWARD SHORE._,The features soften’d by the slumbering mind--
5707,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But other beauties, when disposed to sleep,"
5708,_EDWARD SHORE._,Should from the eye of keen inspector keep:
5709,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The lovely nymph who would her swain surprise,"
5710,_EDWARD SHORE._,"May close her mouth, but not conceal her eyes;"
5711,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Sleep from the fairest face some beauty takes,           250"
5712,_EDWARD SHORE._,And all the homely features homelier makes;
5713,_EDWARD SHORE._,"So thought our wife, beholding with a sigh"
5714,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Her sleeping spouse, and Edward smiling by."
5715,_EDWARD SHORE._,A sick relation for the husband sent;
5716,_EDWARD SHORE._,Without delay the friendly sceptic went;
5717,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Nor fear’d the youthful pair, for he had seen"
5718,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The wife untroubled, and the friend serene;"
5719,_EDWARD SHORE._,"No selfish purpose in his roving eyes,"
5720,_EDWARD SHORE._,No vile deception in her fond replies:
5721,_EDWARD SHORE._,"So judged the husband, and with judgment true,           260"
5722,_EDWARD SHORE._,For neither yet the guilt or danger knew.
5723,_EDWARD SHORE._,What now remain’d? but they again should play
5724,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Th’ accustom’d game, and walk th’ accustom’d way;"
5725,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With careless freedom should converse or read,"
5726,_EDWARD SHORE._,And the friend’s absence neither fear nor heed.
5727,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But rather now they seem’d confused, constrain’d;      }"
5728,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Within their room still restless they remain’d,        }"
5729,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And painfully they felt, and knew each other pain’d.-- }"
5730,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Ah! foolish men! how could ye thus depend,"
5731,_EDWARD SHORE._,"One on himself, the other on his friend?                 270"
5732,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The youth with troubled eye the lady saw,"
5733,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Yet felt too brave, too daring to withdraw;"
5734,_EDWARD SHORE._,"While she, with tuneless hand the jarring keys"
5735,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Touching, was not one moment at her ease."
5736,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Now would she walk, and call her friendly guide,"
5737,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Now speak of rain, and cast her cloak aside;"
5738,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Seize on a book, unconscious what she read,"
5739,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And restless still, to new resources fled;"
5740,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then laugh’d aloud, then tried to look serene,"
5741,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And ever changed, and every change was seen.             280"
5742,_EDWARD SHORE._,Painful it is to dwell on deeds of shame--
5743,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The trying day was past, another came;"
5744,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The third was all remorse, confusion, dread,"
5745,_EDWARD SHORE._,And (all too late!) the fallen hero fled.
5746,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then felt the youth, in that seducing time,"
5747,_EDWARD SHORE._,How feebly honour guards the heart from crime:
5748,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Small is his native strength; man needs the stay,"
5749,_EDWARD SHORE._,The strength imparted in the trying day;
5750,_EDWARD SHORE._,For all that honour brings against the force
5751,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of headlong passion, aids its rapid course;              290"
5752,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Its slight resistance but provokes the fire,"
5753,_EDWARD SHORE._,"As wood-work stops the flame, and then conveys it higher."
5754,_EDWARD SHORE._,The husband came; a wife by guilt made bold
5755,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Had, meeting, sooth’d him, as in days of old;"
5756,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But soon this fact transpired; her strong distress,"
5757,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And his friend’s absence, left him nought to guess."
5758,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Still cool, though grieved, thus prudence bade him write--"
5759,_EDWARD SHORE._,"“I cannot pardon, and I will not fight;"
5760,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Thou art too poor a culprit for the laws,"
5761,_EDWARD SHORE._,And I too faulty to support my cause.                    300
5762,_EDWARD SHORE._,"All must be punish’d; I must sigh alone,"
5763,_EDWARD SHORE._,At home thy victim for her guilt atone;
5764,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And thou, unhappy! virtuous now no more,"
5765,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Must loss of fame, peace, purity deplore;"
5766,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Sinners with praise will pierce thee to the heart,"
5767,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And saints deriding, tell thee what thou art.”"
5768,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Such was his fall; and Edward, from that time,"
5769,_EDWARD SHORE._,Felt in full force the censure and the crime--
5770,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Despised, ashamed; his noble views before,"
5771,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And his proud thoughts, degraded him the more.           310"
5772,_EDWARD SHORE._,Should he repent--would that conceal his shame?
5773,_EDWARD SHORE._,Could peace be his? It perish’d with his fame.
5774,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Himself he scorn’d, nor could his crime forgive;"
5775,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He fear’d to die, yet felt ashamed to live;"
5776,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Grieved, but not contrite was his heart--oppress’d,"
5777,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Not broken; not converted, but distress’d;"
5778,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He wanted will to bend the stubborn knee,             }"
5779,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He wanted light the cause of ill to see,              }"
5780,_EDWARD SHORE._,"To learn how frail is man, how humble then should be; }"
5781,_EDWARD SHORE._,"For faith he had not, or a faith too weak                320"
5782,_EDWARD SHORE._,To gain the help that humbled sinners seek;
5783,_EDWARD SHORE._,Else had he pray’d--to an offended God
5784,_EDWARD SHORE._,His tears had flown a penitential flood;
5785,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Though far astray, he would have heard the call"
5786,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of mercy--“Come! return, thou prodigal;”"
5787,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then, though confused, distress’d, ashamed, afraid,"
5788,_EDWARD SHORE._,Still had the trembling penitent obey’d;
5789,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Though faith had fainted, when assail’d by fear,"
5790,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Hope to the soul had whisper’d, “Persevere!”"
5791,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Till, in his Father’s house an humbled guest,            330"
5792,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He would have found forgiveness, comfort, rest."
5793,_EDWARD SHORE._,But all this joy was to our youth denied
5794,_EDWARD SHORE._,By his fierce passions and his daring pride;
5795,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And shame and doubt impell’d him in a course,"
5796,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Once so abhorr’d, with unresisted force."
5797,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Proud minds and guilty, whom their crimes oppress,"
5798,_EDWARD SHORE._,Fly to new crimes for comfort and redress;
5799,_EDWARD SHORE._,So found our fallen youth a short relief
5800,_EDWARD SHORE._,"In wine, the opiate guilt applies to grief--"
5801,_EDWARD SHORE._,From fleeting mirth that o’er the bottle lives;          340
5802,_EDWARD SHORE._,From the false joy its inspiration gives;
5803,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And from associates, pleased to find a friend"
5804,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With powers to lead them, gladden, and defend,"
5805,_EDWARD SHORE._,In all those scenes where transient ease is found
5806,_EDWARD SHORE._,"For minds whom sins oppress, and sorrows wound."
5807,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Wine is like anger; for it makes us strong,"
5808,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Blind and impatient, and it leads us wrong;           }"
5809,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The strength is quickly lost, we feel the error long. }"
5810,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Thus led, thus strengthen’d in an evil cause,         }"
5811,_EDWARD SHORE._,"For folly pleading, sought the youth applause;           350"
5812,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Sad for a time, then eloquently wild,"
5813,_EDWARD SHORE._,He gaily spoke as his companions smiled;
5814,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Lightly he rose, and with his former grace"
5815,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Proposed some doubt, and argued on the case;"
5816,_EDWARD SHORE._,Fate and fore-knowledge were his favourite themes--
5817,_EDWARD SHORE._,"How vain man’s purpose, how absurd his schemes:"
5818,_EDWARD SHORE._,"“Whatever is, was ere our birth decreed;         }"
5819,_EDWARD SHORE._,"We think our actions from ourselves proceed,     }"
5820,_EDWARD SHORE._,And idly we lament th’ inevitable deed;          }
5821,_EDWARD SHORE._,"It seems our own, but there’s a power above              360"
5822,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Directs the motion, nay, that makes us move;"
5823,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Nor good nor evil can you beings name,"
5824,_EDWARD SHORE._,Who are but rooks and castles in the game;
5825,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Superior natures with their puppets play,"
5826,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Till, bagg’d or buried, all are swept away.”"
5827,_EDWARD SHORE._,Such were the notions of a mind to ill
5828,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Now prone, but ardent and determined still."
5829,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Of joy now eager, as before of fame,"
5830,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And screen’d by folly when assail’d by shame,"
5831,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Deeply he sank; obey’d each passion’s call,              370"
5832,_EDWARD SHORE._,And used his reason to defend them all.
5833,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Shall I proceed, and step by step relate"
5834,_EDWARD SHORE._,The odious progress of a sinner’s fate?
5835,_EDWARD SHORE._,No--let me rather hasten to the time
5836,_EDWARD SHORE._,(Sure to arrive) when misery waits on crime.
5837,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With virtue, prudence fled; what Shore possess’d"
5838,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Was sold, was spent, and he was now distress’d;"
5839,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And Want, unwelcome stranger, pale and wan,"
5840,_EDWARD SHORE._,Met with her haggard looks the hurried man;
5841,_EDWARD SHORE._,His pride felt keenly what he must expect                380
5842,_EDWARD SHORE._,From useless pity and from cold neglect.
5843,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Struck by new terrors, from his friends he fled,"
5844,_EDWARD SHORE._,And wept his woes upon a restless bed;
5845,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Retiring late, at early hour to rise,"
5846,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With shrunken features, and with bloodshot eyes."
5847,_EDWARD SHORE._,"If sleep one moment closed the dismal view,"
5848,_EDWARD SHORE._,Fancy her terrors built upon the true;
5849,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And night and day had their alternate woes,"
5850,_EDWARD SHORE._,"That baffled pleasure, and that mock’d repose;"
5851,_EDWARD SHORE._,Till to despair and anguish was consign’d                390
5852,_EDWARD SHORE._,The wreck and ruin of a noble mind.
5853,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Now seized for debt, and lodged within a jail,"
5854,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He tried his friendships, and he found them fail;"
5855,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then fail’d his spirits, and his thoughts were all"
5856,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Fix’d on his sins, his sufferings, and his fall."
5857,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His ruffled mind was pictured in his face,"
5858,_EDWARD SHORE._,Once the fair seat of dignity and grace;
5859,_EDWARD SHORE._,Great was the danger of a man so prone
5860,_EDWARD SHORE._,"To think of madness, and to think alone;"
5861,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Yet pride still lived, and struggled to sustain          400"
5862,_EDWARD SHORE._,The drooping spirit and the roving brain;
5863,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But this too fail’d: a friend his freedom gave,"
5864,_EDWARD SHORE._,And sent him help the threat’ning world to brave;
5865,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Gave solid counsel what to seek or flee,"
5866,_EDWARD SHORE._,But still would stranger to his person be:
5867,_EDWARD SHORE._,"In vain! the truth determined to explore,"
5868,_EDWARD SHORE._,He traced the friend whom he had wrong’d before.
5869,_EDWARD SHORE._,This was too much; both aided and advised
5870,_EDWARD SHORE._,"By one who shunn’d him, pitied, and despised,"
5871,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He bore it not; ’twas a deciding stroke,                 410"
5872,_EDWARD SHORE._,And on his reason like a torrent broke:
5873,_EDWARD SHORE._,"In dreadful stillness he appear’d awhile,"
5874,_EDWARD SHORE._,With vacant horror and a ghastly smile;
5875,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then rose at once into the frantic rage,"
5876,_EDWARD SHORE._,"That force controll’d not, nor could love assuage."
5877,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Friends now appear’d, but in the man was seen"
5878,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The angry maniac, with vindictive mien;"
5879,_EDWARD SHORE._,Too late their pity gave to care and skill
5880,_EDWARD SHORE._,The hurried mind and ever-wandering will;
5881,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Unnoticed pass’d all time, and not a ray                 420"
5882,_EDWARD SHORE._,Of reason broke on his benighted way;
5883,_EDWARD SHORE._,"But now he spurn’d the straw in pure disdain,"
5884,_EDWARD SHORE._,And now laugh’d loudly at the clinking chain.
5885,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Then, as its wrath subsided, by degrees"
5886,_EDWARD SHORE._,The mind sank slowly to infantine ease;
5887,_EDWARD SHORE._,"To playful folly, and to causeless joy,"
5888,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Speech without aim, and without end, employ;"
5889,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He drew fantastic figures on the wall,"
5890,_EDWARD SHORE._,And gave some wild relation of them all;
5891,_EDWARD SHORE._,"With brutal shape he join’d the human face,              430"
5892,_EDWARD SHORE._,And idiot smiles approved the motley race.
5893,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Harmless at length th’ unhappy man was found,"
5894,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The spirit settled, but the reason drown’d;"
5895,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And all the dreadful tempest died away,"
5896,_EDWARD SHORE._,To the dull stillness of the misty day.
5897,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And now his freedom he attain’d--if free,"
5898,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The lost to reason, truth, and hope, can be;"
5899,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His friends, or wearied with the charge, or sure"
5900,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The harmless wretch was now beyond a cure,"
5901,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Gave him to wander where he pleased, and find            440"
5902,_EDWARD SHORE._,His own resources for the eager mind;
5903,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The playful children of the place he meets,"
5904,_EDWARD SHORE._,Playful with them he rambles through the streets;
5905,_EDWARD SHORE._,"In all they need, his stronger arm he lends,"
5906,_EDWARD SHORE._,And his lost mind to these approving friends.
5907,_EDWARD SHORE._,"That gentle maid, whom once the youth had loved,"
5908,_EDWARD SHORE._,Is now with mild religious pity moved;
5909,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Kindly she chides his boyish flights, while he"
5910,_EDWARD SHORE._,Will for a moment fix’d and pensive be;
5911,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And, as she trembling speaks, his lively eyes            450"
5912,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Explore her looks, he listens to her sighs;"
5913,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Charm’d by her voice, th’ harmonious sounds invade"
5914,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His clouded mind, and for a time persuade:"
5915,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Like a pleased infant, who has newly caught"
5916,_EDWARD SHORE._,From the maternal glance a gleam of thought;
5917,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He stands enrapt, the half-known voice to hear,"
5918,_EDWARD SHORE._,"And starts, half-conscious, at the falling tear."
5919,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Rarely from town, nor then unwatch’d, he goes,"
5920,_EDWARD SHORE._,"In darker mood, as if to hide his woes;"
5921,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Returning soon, he with impatience seeks                 460"
5922,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His youthful friends, and shouts, and sings, and speaks;"
5923,_EDWARD SHORE._,Speaks a wild speech with action all as wild--
5924,_EDWARD SHORE._,"The children’s leader, and himself a child;"
5925,_EDWARD SHORE._,"He spins their top, or, at their bidding, bends"
5926,_EDWARD SHORE._,"His back, while o’er it leap his laughing friends;"
5927,_EDWARD SHORE._,"Simple and weak, he acts the boy once more,"
5928,_EDWARD SHORE._,And heedless children call him Silly Shore.
5929,_EDWARD SHORE._,
5930,_EDWARD SHORE._,"[7] Fasil was a rebel chief, and Michael the general of the royal"

5932,_EDWARD SHORE._,other respects their characters were nearly similar. They are both
5933,_EDWARD SHORE._,represented as cruel and treacherous; and even the apparently strong
5934,_EDWARD SHORE._,"distinction of loyal and rebellious is in a great measure set aside,"
5935,_EDWARD SHORE._,"when we are informed that Fasil was an open enemy, and Michael an"

6130,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Nay! felt it too--for Harriot was, in truth,"
6131,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,A tall fair beauty in the bloom of youth;
6132,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"And, from the pleasure and surprise, a grace"
6133,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,Adorn’d the blooming damsel’s form and face;
6134,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Then too, such high respect and duty paid"
6135,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,By all--such silent reverence in the maid;
6136,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Vent’ring with caution, yet with haste, a glance;"
6137,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Loth to retire, yet trembling to advance,                160"

6140,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Sweet was his sleep, and in the morn again"

6144,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Nature has bless’d her form, and Heaven her mind,"
6145,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,But in her favours Fortune is unkind;
6146,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Poor is the maid--nay, poor she cannot prove"

6149,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,To go or stay--uncertain what he meant.
6150,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,He moved to part--they begg’d him first to dine;
6151,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,And who could then escape from love and wine?
6152,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"As came the night, more charming grew the fair,"
6153,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,And seem’d to watch him with a two-fold care:
6154,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"On the third morn, resolving not to stay,"
6155,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Though urged by love, he bravely rode away."
6156,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Arrived at home, three pensive days he gave"
6157,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,To feelings fond and meditations grave;                  180
6158,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Lovely she was, and, if he did not err,"
6159,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,As fond of him as his fond heart of her;
6160,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Still he delay’d, unable to decide"
6161,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Which was the master-passion, love or pride:"
6162,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"He sometimes wonder’d how his friend could make,"
6163,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"And then exulted in, the night’s mistake;"
6164,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Had she but fortune, “doubtless then,” he cried,"
6165,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,“Some happier man had won the wealthy bride.”
6166,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"While thus he hung in balance, now inclined"
6167,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"To change his state, and then to change his mind--      190"

6169,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"A letter, which his crafty master found;"

6172,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Of whom her tender mother, full of fears,"
6173,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Had written much--“She caught her oft in tears,"

6176,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Nor can define, dear girl! the cherish’d pain,"
6177,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,But would rejoice to see the cause again.                200
6178,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"That neighbouring youth, whom she endured before,"

6203,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"“Is there in Harriot’s humble mind this fire,"
6204,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,This fierce impatience?” ask’d the puzzled ’squire:
6205,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,“Has marriage changed her? or the mask she wore
6206,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Has she thrown by, and is herself once more?”"
6207,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Hour after hour, when clouds on clouds appear,"
6208,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Dark and more dark, we know the tempest near;            230"

6210,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"And threat’ning glance, forerun domestic storm:"
6211,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"So read the husband, and, with troubled mind,"
6212,_’SQUIRE THOMAS_.,"Reveal’d his fears--“My love, I hope you find"

6392,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Nor wants he will his station to improve,"
6393,_JESSE AND COLIN._,A just ambition waked by faithful love;--
6394,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Still is he poor--and here my father’s friend
6395,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Deigns for his daughter, as her own, to send;             20"
6396,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"A worthy lady, who it seems has known"
6397,_JESSE AND COLIN._,A world of griefs and troubles of her own.
6398,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I was an infant, when she came, a guest"
6399,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Beneath my father’s humble roof to rest;
6400,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Her kindred all unfeeling, vast her woes;"
6401,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Such her complaint, and there she found repose;"
6402,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Enrich’d by fortune, now she nobly lives,"
6403,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And nobly, from the blest abundance, gives;"
6404,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The grief, the want of human life, she knows,"
6405,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And comfort there and here relief bestows;                30
6406,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But are they not dependants?--Foolish pride!
6407,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Am I not honour’d by such friend and guide?
6408,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Have I a home,” (here Jesse dropp’d a tear,)"
6409,_JESSE AND COLIN._,“Or friend beside?”--A faithful friend was near.
6410,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Now Colin came, at length resolved to lay"
6411,_JESSE AND COLIN._,His heart before her and to urge her stay;
6412,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"True, his own plough the gentle Colin drove,"
6413,_JESSE AND COLIN._,An humble farmer with aspiring love;
6414,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Who, urged by passion, never dared till now,"
6415,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thus urged by fears, his trembling hopes avow.            40"
6416,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Her father’s glebe he managed; every year
6417,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The grateful vicar held the youth more dear;
6418,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"He saw indeed the prize in Colin’s view,"
6419,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And wish’d his Jesse with a man so true;
6420,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Timid as true, he urged with anxious air"
6421,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"His tender hope, and made the trembling prayer;"
6422,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When Jesse saw, nor could with coldness see,"
6423,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Such fond respect, such tried sincerity,"
6424,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Grateful for favours to her father dealt,"
6425,_JESSE AND COLIN._,She more than grateful for his passion felt;              50
6426,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Nor could she frown on one so good and kind,"
6427,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Yet fear’d to smile, and was unfix’d in mind;"
6428,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But prudence placed the female friend in view--
6429,_JESSE AND COLIN._,What might not one so rich and grateful do?
6430,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"So lately, too, the good old vicar died,         }"
6431,_JESSE AND COLIN._,His faithful daughter must not cast aside        }
6432,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The signs of filial grief, and be a ready bride: }"
6433,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thus, led by prudence, to the lady’s seat"
6434,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The village-beauty purposed to retreat;
6435,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But, as in hard-fought fields the victor knows            60"
6436,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"What to the vanquish’d he, in honour, owes,"
6437,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"So, in this conquest over powerful love,"
6438,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Prudence resolved a generous foe to prove;
6439,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And Jesse felt a mingled fear and pain
6440,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"In her dismission of a faithful swain,"
6441,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Gave her kind thanks, and when she saw his wo,"
6442,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Kindly betray’d that she was loth to go.
6443,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But would she promise, if abroad she met              }"
6444,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"A frowning world, she would remember yet              }"
6445,_JESSE AND COLIN._,“Where dwelt a friend?”--“That could she not forget.” }
6446,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And thus they parted; but each faithful heart             71
6447,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Felt the compulsion, and refused to part."
6448,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Now by the morning mail the timid maid
6449,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Was to that kind and wealthy dame convey’d;
6450,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Whose invitation, when her father died,"
6451,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Jesse as comfort to her heart applied.
6452,_JESSE AND COLIN._,She knew the days her generous friend had seen--
6453,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"As wife and widow, evil days had been;"
6454,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She married early, and for half her life"
6455,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Was an insulted and forsaken wife;                        80
6456,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Widow’d and poor, her angry father gave,"
6457,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Mix’d with reproach, the pittance of a slave;"
6458,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Forgetful brothers pass’d her, but she knew"
6459,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Her humbler friends, and to their home withdrew;"
6460,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The good old vicar to her sire applied
6461,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"For help, and help’d her when her sire denied;"
6462,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When in few years death stalk’d through bower and hall,"
6463,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Sires, sons, and sons of sons, were buried all;"
6464,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She then abounded, and had wealth to spare"
6465,_JESSE AND COLIN._,For softening grief she once was doom’d to share;         90
6466,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thus train’d in misery’s school, and taught to feel,"
6467,_JESSE AND COLIN._,She would rejoice an orphan’s woes to heal.
6468,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"So Jesse thought, who look’d within her breast,"
6469,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And thence conceived how bounteous minds are bless’d.
6470,_JESSE AND COLIN._,From her vast mansion look’d the lady down
6471,_JESSE AND COLIN._,On humbler buildings of a busy town;
6472,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thence came her friends of either sex, and all"
6473,_JESSE AND COLIN._,With whom she lived on terms reciprocal.
6474,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"They pass’d the hours with their accustom’d ease,"
6475,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"As guests inclined, but not compell’d to please;         100"
6476,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But there were others in the mansion found,"
6477,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"For office chosen, and by duties bound;"
6478,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Three female rivals, each of power possess’d,"
6479,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Th’ attendant-maid, poor friend, and kindred-guest."
6480,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To these came Jesse, as a seaman thrown"
6481,_JESSE AND COLIN._,By the rude storm upon a coast unknown:
6482,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The view was flattering, civil seem’d the race,"
6483,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But all unknown the dangers of the place.
6484,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Few hours had pass’d, when, from attendants freed,"
6485,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The lady utter’d--“This is kind indeed;                  110
6486,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Believe me, love! that I for one like you"
6487,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Have daily pray’d, a friend discreet and true;"
6488,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Oh! wonder not that I on you depend,"
6489,_JESSE AND COLIN._,You are mine own hereditary friend:
6490,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Hearken, my Jesse, never can I trust"
6491,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Beings ungrateful, selfish, and unjust;"
6492,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But you are present, and my load of care"
6493,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Your love will serve to lighten and to share.
6494,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Come near me, Jesse--let not those below"
6495,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Of my reliance on your friendship know;                  120
6496,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Look as they look, be in their freedoms free--"
6497,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But all they say do you convey to me.”
6498,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Here Jesse’s thoughts to Colin’s cottage flew,"
6499,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And with such speed she scarce their absence knew.
6500,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Jane loves her mistress, and should she depart,"
6501,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I lose her service, and she breaks her heart;"
6502,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"My ways and wishes, looks and thoughts she knows,"
6503,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And duteous care by close attention shows;
6504,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But is she faithful? in temptation strong?
6505,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Will she not wrong me? ah! I fear the wrong.             130
6506,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Your father loved me; now, in time of need,"
6507,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Watch for my good, and to his place succeed."
6508,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Blood doesn’t bind--that girl, who every day"
6509,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Eats of my bread, would wish my life away;"
6510,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I am her _dear relation_, and she thinks"
6511,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To make her fortune, an ambitious minx!"
6512,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She only courts me for the prospect’s sake,"
6513,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Because she knows I have a will to make;
6514,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Yes, love! my will delay’d, I know not how--"
6515,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But you are here, and I will make it now.                140"
6516,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“That idle creature, keep her in your view,"
6517,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"See what she does, what she desires to do;"
6518,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"On her young mind may artful villains prey,"
6519,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And to my plate and jewels find a way;
6520,_JESSE AND COLIN._,A pleasant humour has the girl; her smile
6521,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And cheerful manner tedious hours beguile;
6522,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But well observe her, ever near her be,"
6523,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Close in your thoughts, in your professions free."
6524,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Again, my Jesse, hear what I advise,"
6525,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And watch a woman ever in disguise;                      150
6526,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Issop, that widow, serious, subtle, sly--"
6527,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But what of this?--I must have company.
6528,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She markets for me, and although she makes"
6529,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Profit, no doubt, of all she undertakes,"
6530,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Yet she is one I can to all produce,"
6531,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And all her talents are in daily use;
6532,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Deprived of her, I may another find"
6533,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"As sly and selfish, with a weaker mind:"
6534,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But never trust her, she is full of art,"
6535,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And worms herself into the closest heart;                160
6536,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Seem then, I pray you, careless in her sight,"
6537,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Nor let her know, my love, how we unite."
6538,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Do, my good Jesse, cast a view around,"
6539,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And let no wrong within my house be found;
6540,_JESSE AND COLIN._,That girl associates with--I know not who
6541,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Are her companions, nor what ill they do;"
6542,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"’Tis then the widow plans, ’tis then she tries"
6543,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Her various arts and schemes for fresh supplies;
6544,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"’Tis then, if ever, Jane her duty quits,"
6545,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And, whom I know not, favours and admits:                170"
6546,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Oh! watch their movements all; for me ’tis hard,"
6547,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Indeed is vain, but you may keep a guard;"
6548,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And I, when none your watchful glance deceive,"
6549,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"May make my will, and think what I shall leave.”"
6550,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Jesse, with fear, disgust, alarm, surprise,"
6551,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Heard of these duties for her ears and eyes;
6552,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Heard by what service she must gain her bread,"
6553,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And went with scorn and sorrow to her bed.
6554,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Jane was a servant fitted for her place,"
6555,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Experienced, cunning, fraudful, selfish, base;           180"
6556,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Skill’d in those mean, humiliating arts"
6557,_JESSE AND COLIN._,That make their way to proud and selfish hearts;
6558,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"By instinct taught, she felt an awe, a fear,"
6559,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"For Jesse’s upright, simple character;"
6560,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Whom with gross flattery she awhile assail’d,"
6561,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And then beheld with hatred when it fail’d;
6562,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Yet, trying still upon her mind for hold,"
6563,_JESSE AND COLIN._,She all the secrets of the mansion told;
6564,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And to invite an equal trust she drew
6565,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Of every mind a bold and rapid view;                     190
6566,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But on the widow’d friend with deep disdain,"
6567,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And rancorous envy, dwelt the treacherous Jane.--"
6568,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"In vain such arts; without deceit or pride,"
6569,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"With a just taste and feeling for her guide,"
6570,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"From all contagion Jesse kept apart,"
6571,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Free in her manners, guarded in her heart."
6572,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Jesse one morn was thoughtful, and her sigh"
6573,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The widow heard as she was passing by;
6574,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And--“Well!” she said, “is that some distant swain,"
6575,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Or aught with us, that gives your bosom pain?            200"
6576,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Come, we are fellow-sufferers, slaves in thrall,"
6577,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And tasks and griefs are common to us all;
6578,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Think not my frankness strange: they love to paint
6579,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Their state with freedom, who endure restraint;"
6580,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And there is something in that speaking eye
6581,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And sober mien, that prove I may rely."
6582,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"You came a stranger; to my words attend,"
6583,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Accept my offer, and you find a friend;"
6584,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"It is a labyrinth in which you stray,"
6585,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Come, hold my clue, and I will lead the way.             210"
6586,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Good Heav’n! that one so jealous, envious, base,"
6587,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Should be the mistress of so sweet a place;
6588,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She, who so long herself was low and poor,"
6589,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Now broods suspicious on her useless store;
6590,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She loves to see us abject, loves to deal"
6591,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Her insult round, and then pretends to feel;"
6592,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Prepare to cast all dignity aside,"
6593,_JESSE AND COLIN._,For know your talents will be quickly tried;
6594,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Nor think, from favours past, a friend to gain,"
6595,_JESSE AND COLIN._,’Tis but by duties we our posts maintain:                220
6596,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I read her novels, gossip through the town,"
6597,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And daily go, for idle stories, down;"
6598,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I cheapen all she buys, and bear the curse"
6599,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Of honest tradesmen for my niggard-purse;
6600,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And, when for her this meanness I display,"
6601,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She cries, ’I heed not what I throw away;’"
6602,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Of secret bargains I endure the shame,"
6603,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And stake my credit for our fish and game;
6604,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Oft has she smiled to hear, ’her generous soul"
6605,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Would gladly give, but stoops to my control’;            230"
6606,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Nay! I have heard her, when she chanced to come"
6607,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Where I contended for a petty sum,"
6608,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Affirm ’twas painful to behold such care,"
6609,_JESSE AND COLIN._,‘But Issop’s nature is to pinch and spare:’
6610,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thus all the meanness of the house is mine,"
6611,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And my reward--to scorn her, and to dine."
6612,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“See next that giddy thing, with neither pride"
6613,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To keep her safe, nor principle to guide:"
6614,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Poor, idle, simple flirt! as sure as fate"
6615,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Her maiden-fame will have an early date.                 240
6616,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Of her beware; for all who live below
6617,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Have faults they wish not all the world to know;
6618,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And she is fond of listening, full of doubt,"
6619,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And stoops to guilt to find an error out.
6620,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“And now once more observe the artful maid,"
6621,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"A lying, prying, jilting, thievish jade;"
6622,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I think, my love, you would not condescend"
6623,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To call a low, illiterate girl your friend;"
6624,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But in our troubles we are apt, you know,"
6625,_JESSE AND COLIN._,To lean on all who some compassion show;                 250
6626,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And she has flexile features, acting eyes,"
6627,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And seems with every look to sympathise;
6628,_JESSE AND COLIN._,No mirror can a mortal’s grief express
6629,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"With more precision, or can feel it less;"
6630,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"That proud, mean spirit, she by fawning courts,"
6631,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"By vulgar flattery, and by vile reports;"
6632,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And by that proof she every instant gives
6633,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To one so mean, that yet a meaner lives.--"
6634,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Come, I have drawn the curtain, and you see"
6635,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Your fellow-actors, all our company;                     260"
6636,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Should you incline to throw reserve aside,"
6637,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And in my judgment and my love confide,"
6638,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I could some prospects open to your view,"
6639,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"That ask attention--and, till then, adieu.”"
6640,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Farewell!” said Jesse, hastening to her room,"
6641,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Where all she saw within, without, was gloom:"
6642,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Confused, perplex’d, she pass’d a dreary hour,"
6643,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Before her reason could exert its power;
6644,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To her all seem’d mysterious, all allied"
6645,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To avarice, meanness, folly, craft, and pride;           270"
6646,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Wearied with thought, she breathed the garden’s air,"
6647,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Then came the laughing lass, and join’d her there."
6648,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“My sweetest friend has dwelt with us a week,"
6649,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And does she love us? be sincere and speak;
6650,_JESSE AND COLIN._,My aunt you cannot--Lord! how I should hate
6651,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To be like her, all misery and state;"
6652,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Proud, and yet envious, she disgusted sees"
6653,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"All who are happy, and who look at ease."
6654,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Let friendship bind us, I will quickly show"
6655,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Some favourites near us you’ll be bless’d to know;       280
6656,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"My aunt forbids it--but, can she expect,"
6657,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To soothe her spleen, we shall ourselves neglect?"
6658,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Jane and the widow were to watch and stay
6659,_JESSE AND COLIN._,My free-born feet; I watch’d as well as they;
6660,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Lo! what is this? this simple key explores
6661,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The dark recess that holds the spinster’s stores;
6662,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And led by her ill star, I chanced to see"
6663,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Where Issop keeps her stock of ratafie;
6664,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Used in the hours of anger and alarm,"
6665,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"It makes her civil, and it keeps her warm;               290"
6666,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thus bless’d with secrets, both would choose to hide,"
6667,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Their fears now grant me what their scorn denied.
6668,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“My freedom thus by their assent secured,"
6669,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Bad as it is, the place may be endured;"
6670,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And bad it is, but her estates, you know,"
6671,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And her beloved hoards, she must bestow;"
6672,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"So we can slyly our amusements take,"
6673,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And friends of dæmons, if they help us, make.”"
6674,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Strange creatures these,” thought Jesse, half inclined"
6675,_JESSE AND COLIN._,To smile at one malicious and yet kind;                  300
6676,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Frank and yet cunning, with a heart to love"
6677,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And malice prompt--the serpent and the dove;
6678,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Here could she dwell? or could she yet depart?
6679,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Could she be artful? could she bear with art?--
6680,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"This splendid mansion gave the cottage grace,"
6681,_JESSE AND COLIN._,She thought a dungeon was a happier place;
6682,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And Colin pleading, when he pleaded best,"
6683,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Wrought not such sudden change in Jesse’s breast.
6684,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The wondering maiden, who had only read"
6685,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Of such vile beings, saw them now with dread;            310"
6686,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Safe in themselves--for nature has design’d
6687,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The creature’s poison harmless to the kind;
6688,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But all beside who in the haunts are found
6689,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Must dread the poison, and must feel the wound."
6690,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Days full of care, slow weary weeks pass’d on;"
6691,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Eager to go, still Jesse was not gone;"
6692,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Her time in trifling or in tears she spent,"
6693,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She never gave, she never felt content:"
6694,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The lady wonder’d that her humble guest
6695,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Strove not to please, would neither lie nor jest;        320"
6696,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She sought no news, no scandal would convey,"
6697,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But walk’d for health, and was at church to pray;"
6698,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"All this displeased, and soon the widow cried:"
6699,_JESSE AND COLIN._,“Let me be frank--I am not satisfied;
6700,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"You know my wishes, I your judgment trust;"
6701,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"You can be useful, Jesse, and you must;"
6702,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Let me be plainer, child--I want an ear,"
6703,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When I am deaf, instead of mine to hear;"
6704,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When mine is sleeping, let your eye awake;"
6705,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When I observe not, observation take;                    330"

6707,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Then threat’ning whispers make my soul afraid;
6708,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The tread of strangers to my ear ascends,"
6709,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Fed at my cost, the minions of my friends;"
6710,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"While you, without a care, a wish to please,"
6711,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Eat the vile bread of idleness and ease.”
6712,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Th’ indignant girl astonish’d answer’d--“Nay!
6713,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"This instant, madam, let me haste away;"
6714,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thus speaks my father’s, thus an orphan’s, friend?"
6715,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"This instant, lady, let your bounty end.”                340"
6716,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The lady frown’d indignant--“What!” she cried,"
6717,_JESSE AND COLIN._,“A vicar’s daughter with a princess’ pride!
6718,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And pauper’s lot! but pitying I forgive;
6719,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"How, simple Jesse, do you think to live?"
6720,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Have I not power to help you, foolish maid?"
6721,_JESSE AND COLIN._,To my concerns be your attention paid;
6722,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"With cheerful mind th’ allotted duties take,"
6723,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And recollect I have a will to make.”
6724,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Jesse, who felt as liberal natures feel,"
6725,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When thus the baser their designs reveal,                350"
6726,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Replied--“Those duties were to her unfit,"
6727,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Nor would her spirit to her tasks submit.”
6728,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"In silent scorn the lady sate awhile,"
6729,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And then replied with stern contemptuous smile--
6730,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Think you, fair madam, that you came to share"
6731,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Fortunes like mine without a thought or care?
6732,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"A guest, indeed! from every trouble free,"
6733,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Dress’d by my help, with not a care for me."
6734,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When I a visit to your father made,"
6735,_JESSE AND COLIN._,I for the poor assistance largely paid;                  360
6736,_JESSE AND COLIN._,To his domestics I their tasks assign’d;
6737,_JESSE AND COLIN._,I fix’d the portion for his hungry hind;
6738,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And had your father (simple man!) obey’d
6739,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"My good advice, and watch’d as well as pray’d,"
6740,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"He might have left you something with his prayers,"
6741,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And lent some colour for these lofty airs.--
6742,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“In tears! my love! Oh, then my soften’d heart"
6743,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Cannot resist--we never more will part;
6744,_JESSE AND COLIN._,I need your friendship--I will be your friend;
6745,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And thus determined, to my will attend.”                 370"
6746,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Jesse went forth, but with determined soul"
6747,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"To fly such love, to break from such control;"
6748,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“I hear enough,” the trembling damsel cried;"
6749,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Flight be my care, and Providence my guide:"
6750,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Ere yet a prisoner, I escape will make;               }"
6751,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Will, thus display’d, th’ insidious arts forsake,     }"
6752,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And, as the rattle sounds, will fly the fatal snake.” }"
6753,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Jesse her thanks upon the morrow paid,"
6754,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Prepared to go, determined though afraid."
6755,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Ungrateful creature,” said the lady, “this            380"
6756,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Could I imagine?--are you frantic, miss?"
6757,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"What! leave your friend, your prospects--is it true?”"
6758,_JESSE AND COLIN._,This Jesse answer’d by a mild “Adieu!”
6759,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The dame replied, “Then houseless may you rove,"
6760,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The starving victim to a guilty love;
6761,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Branded with shame, in sickness doom’d to nurse"
6762,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"An ill-form’d cub, your scandal and your curse;"
6763,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Spurn’d by its scoundrel father, and ill fed"
6764,_JESSE AND COLIN._,By surly rustics with the parish-bread!--
6765,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Relent you not?--speak--yet I can forgive;               390
6766,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Still live with me”--“With you,” said Jesse, “live?"
6767,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"No! I would first endure what you describe,"
6768,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Rather than breathe with your detested tribe:
6769,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Who long have feign’d, till now their very hearts"
6770,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Are firmly fix’d in their accursed parts;
6771,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Who all profess esteem, and feel disdain,"
6772,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And all, with justice, of deceit complain;"
6773,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Whom I could pity, but that, while I stay,"
6774,_JESSE AND COLIN._,My terror drives all kinder thoughts away;
6775,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Grateful for this, that when I think of you,             400"
6776,_JESSE AND COLIN._,I little fear what poverty can do.”
6777,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The angry matron her attendant Jane
6778,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Summon’d in haste to soothe the fierce disdain.
6779,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“A vile detested wretch!” the lady cried,              }"
6780,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Yet shall she be, by many an effort, tried,             }"
6781,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And, clogg’d with debt and fear, against her will abide; }"
6782,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And, once secured, she never shall depart"
6783,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Till I have proved the firmness of her heart;
6784,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Then when she dares not, would not, cannot go,"
6785,_JESSE AND COLIN._,I’ll make her feel what ’tis to use me so.”              410
6786,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The pensive Colin in his garden stray’d,"
6787,_JESSE AND COLIN._,But felt not then the beauties it display’d;
6788,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"There many a pleasant object met his view,"
6789,_JESSE AND COLIN._,A rising wood of oaks behind it grew;
6790,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"A stream ran by it, and the village-green"
6791,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And public road were from the gardens seen;
6792,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Save where the pine and larch the bound’ry made,"
6793,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And on the rose-beds threw a softening shade.
6794,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The mother sat beside the garden-door,"
6795,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Dress’d as in times ere she and hers were poor;          420
6796,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The broad-laced cap was known in ancient days,"
6797,_JESSE AND COLIN._,When madam’s dress compell’d the village praise;
6798,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And still she look’d as in the times of old,"
6799,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Ere his last farm the erring husband sold;
6800,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"While yet the mansion stood in decent state,"
6801,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And paupers waited at the well-known gate.
6802,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Alas! my son!” the mother cried, “and why"
6803,_JESSE AND COLIN._,That silent grief and oft-repeated sigh?
6804,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"True, we are poor, but thou hast never felt"
6805,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Pangs to thy father for his error dealt;                 430
6806,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Pangs from strong hopes of visionary gain,"
6807,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"For ever raised, and ever found in vain."
6808,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"He rose unhappy! from his fruitless schemes,"
6809,_JESSE AND COLIN._,As guilty wretches from their blissful dreams;
6810,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But thou wert then, my son, a playful child,"
6811,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Wondering at grief, gay, innocent, and wild;"
6812,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Listening at times to thy poor mother’s sighs,"
6813,_JESSE AND COLIN._,With curious looks and innocent surprise;
6814,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thy father dying, thou, my virtuous boy,"
6815,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"My comfort always, waked my soul to joy;                 440"
6816,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"With the poor remnant of our fortune left,"
6817,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Thou hast our station of its gloom bereft:
6818,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thy lively temper, and thy cheerful air,"
6819,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Have cast a smile on sadness and despair;
6820,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Thy active hand has dealt to this poor space
6821,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The bliss of plenty and the charm of grace;
6822,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And all around us wonder when they find
6823,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Such taste and strength, such skill and power combined;"
6824,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"There is no mother, Colin, no not one,"
6825,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But envies me so kind, so good a son;                    450"
6826,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"By thee supported on this failing side,"
6827,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Weakness itself awakes a parent’s pride;
6828,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"I bless the stroke that was my grief before,"
6829,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And feel such joy that ’tis disease no more;
6830,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Shielded by thee, my want becomes my wealth--"
6831,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And, soothed by Colin, sickness smiles at health;"
6832,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The old men love thee, they repeat thy praise,"
6833,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And say, like thee were youth in earlier days;"
6834,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"While every village-maiden cries, ’How gay,"
6835,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"How smart, how brave, how good is Colin Grey!’           460"
6836,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“Yet art thou sad; alas! my son, I know"
6837,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Thy heart is wounded, and the cure is slow;"
6838,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Fain would I think that Jesse still may come
6839,_JESSE AND COLIN._,To share the comforts of our rustic home:
6840,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She surely loved thee; I have seen the maid,"
6841,_JESSE AND COLIN._,When thou hast kindly brought the vicar aid--
6842,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"When thou hast eased his bosom of its pain,"
6843,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Oh! I have seen her--she will come again.”
6844,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The matron ceased; and Colin stood the while
6845,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Silent, but striving for a grateful smile;               470"
6846,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"He then replied--“Ah! sure, had Jesse stay’d,"
6847,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And shared the comforts of our sylvan shade,"
6848,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The tenderest duty and the fondest love
6849,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Would not have fail’d that generous heart to move;
6850,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"A grateful pity would have ruled her breast,"
6851,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And my distresses would have made me blest.
6852,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"“But she is gone, and ever has in view             }"
6853,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Grandeur and taste--and what will then ensue?        }
6854,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Surprise and then delight in scenes so fair and new; }
6855,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"For many a day, perhaps for many a week,                 480"
6856,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Home will have charms, and to her bosom speak;"
6857,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But thoughtless ease, and affluence, and pride,"
6858,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Seen day by day, will draw the heart aside:"
6859,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And she at length, though gentle and sincere,"
6860,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Will think no more of our enjoyments here.”
6861,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Sighing he spake--but hark! he hears th’ approach
6862,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Of rattling wheels! and lo! the evening-coach;
6863,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Once more the movement of the horses’ feet
6864,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Makes the fond heart with strong emotion beat;
6865,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Faint were his hopes, but ever had the sight             490"
6866,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Drawn him to gaze beside his gate at night;
6867,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And when with rapid wheels it hurried by,"
6868,_JESSE AND COLIN._,He grieved his parent with a hopeless sigh;
6869,_JESSE AND COLIN._,And could the blessing have been bought--what sum
6870,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Had he not offer’d, to have Jesse come!"
6871,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"She came--he saw her bending from the door,"
6872,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Her face, her smile, and he beheld no more;"
6873,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Lost in his joy--the mother lent her aid
6874,_JESSE AND COLIN._,T’ assist and to detain the willing maid;
6875,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Who thought her late, her present home to make,          500"
6876,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Sure of a welcome for the vicar’s sake.
6877,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But the good parent was so pleased, so kind,"
6878,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"So pressing Colin, she so much inclined,"
6879,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"That night advanced; and then so long detain’d,          }"
6880,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"No wishes to depart she felt, or feign’d;                }"
6881,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Yet long in doubt she stood, and then perforce remain’d. }"
6882,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Here was a lover fond, a friend sincere;"
6883,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Here was content and joy, for she was here:"
6884,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"In the mild evening, in the scene around,"
6885,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The maid, now free, peculiar beauties found;             510"
6886,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"Blended with village-tones, the evening-gale"
6887,_JESSE AND COLIN._,Gave the sweet night-bird’s warblings to the vale;
6888,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"The youth embolden’d, yet abash’d, now told"
6889,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"His fondest wish, nor found the maiden cold;"
6890,_JESSE AND COLIN._,The mother smiling whisper’d--“Let him go
6891,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And seek the licence!” Jesse answer’d, “No:”"
6892,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But Colin went, I know not if they live"
6893,_JESSE AND COLIN._,With all the comforts wealth and plenty give;
6894,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"But with pure joy to envious souls denied,"
6895,_JESSE AND COLIN._,To suppliant meanness and suspicious pride;              520
6896,_JESSE AND COLIN._,"And village-maids of happy couples say,"
6897,_JESSE AND COLIN._,“They live like Jesse Bourn and Colin Grey.”

6981,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,But now begin to think the laughers wrong;
6982,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Nay, my good uncle, by all teachers moved,         }"
6983,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Will be preferr’d to him who none approved:        }
6984,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Better to love amiss than nothing to have loved.”  }
6985,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Such were his thoughts, when Conscience first began"
6986,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,To hold close converse with th’ awaken’d man.
6987,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He from that time reserved and cautious grew,"
6988,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And for his duties felt obedience due;                    50
6989,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Pious he was not, but he fear’d the pain"
6990,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Of sins committed, nor would sin again."
6991,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Whene’er he stray’d, he found his Conscience rose, }"
6992,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Like one determined what was ill t’ oppose,        }"
6993,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"What wrong t’ accuse, what secret to disclose;     }"
6994,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To drag forth every latent act to light,"
6995,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And fix them fully in the actor’s sight:
6996,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"This gave him trouble, but he still confess’d"
6997,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The labour useful, for it brought him rest."
6998,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The uncle died, and when the nephew read                60"
6999,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The will, and saw the substance of the dead--"
7000,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Five hundred guineas, with a stock in trade--"
7001,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He much rejoiced, and thought his fortune made;"
7002,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Yet felt aspiring pleasure at the sight,"
7003,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And, for increase, increasing appetite."
7004,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Desire of profit idle habits check’d,"
7005,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,(For Fulham’s virtue was to be correct);
7006,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,He and his Conscience had their compact made--
7007,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Urge me with truth, and you will soon persuade;"
7008,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But not,” he cried, “for mere ideal things                70"
7009,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Give me to feel those terror-breeding stings.”
7010,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Let not such thoughts,” she said, “your mind confound;"
7011,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Trifles may wake me, but they never wound;"
7012,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"In them indeed there is a wrong and right,"
7013,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,But you will find me pliant and polite;
7014,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Not like a Conscience of the dotard kind,"
7015,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Awake to dreams, to dire offences blind."
7016,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Let all within be pure; in all beside
7017,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Be your own master, governor, and guide;"
7018,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Alive to danger, in temptation strong--                  80"
7019,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And I shall sleep our whole existence long.”
7020,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Sweet be thy sleep,” said Fulham; “strong must be"
7021,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,The tempting ill that gains access to me;
7022,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Never will I to evil deed consent,"
7023,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Or, if surprised, oh! how will I repent!"
7024,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Should gain be doubtful, soon would I restore"
7025,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The dangerous good, or give it to the poor;"
7026,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Repose for them my growing wealth shall buy--
7027,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Or build--who knows?--an hospital like Guy.--
7028,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Yet why such means to soothe the smart within,            90"
7029,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,While firmly purposed to renounce the sin?”
7030,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Thus our young Trader and his Conscience dwelt
7031,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"In mutual love, and great the joy they felt;"
7032,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But yet in small concerns, in trivial things,"
7033,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“She was,” he said, “too ready with the stings;”"
7034,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And he too apt, in search of growing gains,"
7035,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,To lose the fear of penalties and pains:
7036,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Yet these were trifling bickerings, petty jars,"
7037,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Domestic strifes, preliminary wars;"
7038,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He ventured little, little she express’d                 100"
7039,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Of indignation, and they both had rest."
7040,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Thus was he fix’d to walk the worthy way,"
7041,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,When profit urged him to a bold essay.--
7042,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,A time was that when all at pleasure gamed
7043,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"In lottery-chances, yet of law unblamed;"
7044,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,This Fulham tried: who would to him advance
7045,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"A pound or crown, he gave in turn a chance"
7046,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"For weighty prize--and should they nothing share,"
7047,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,They had their crown or pound in Fulham’s ware;
7048,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Thus the old stores within the shop were sold            110
7049,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"For that which none refuses, new or old."
7050,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Was this unjust? Yet Conscience could not rest
7051,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,But made a mighty struggle in the breast;
7052,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And gave th’ aspiring man an early proof,"
7053,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,That should they war he would have work enough:
7054,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Suppose,” said she, “your vended numbers rise"
7055,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The same with those which gain each real prize,"
7056,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"(Such your proposal,) can you ruin shun?”"
7057,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“A hundred thousand,” he replied, “to one.”--"
7058,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“Still it may happen.”--“I the sum must pay.”--         120
7059,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“You know you cannot.”--“I can run away.”--
7060,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“That is dishonest.”--“Nay, but you must wink"
7061,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"At a chance-hit; it cannot be, I think."
7062,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Upon my conduct as a whole decide,"
7063,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Such trifling errors let my virtues hide;
7064,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Fail I at meeting? am I sleepy there?
7065,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,My purse refuse I with the priest to share?
7066,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Do I deny the poor a helping hand?
7067,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Or stop the wicked women in the Strand?
7068,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Or drink at club beyond a certain pitch?                 130
7069,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Which are your charges? Conscience, tell me which.”"
7070,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“’Tis well,” said she, “but--” “Nay, I pray, have done:"
7071,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Trust me, I will not into danger run.”"
7072,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The lottery drawn, not one demand was made;"
7073,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Fulham gain’d profit and increase of trade.
7074,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“See now,” said he--for Conscience yet arose--"
7075,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“How foolish ’tis such measures to oppose:
7076,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Have I not blameless thus my state advanced?”--
7077,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Still,” mutter’d Conscience, “still it might have chanced.”--"
7078,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Might!” said our hero, “who is so exact                 140"
7079,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,As to inquire what might have been a fact?”
7080,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Now Fulham’s shop contain’d a curious view
7081,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Of costly trifles, elegant and new:"
7082,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,The papers told where kind mammas might buy
7083,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,The gayest toys to charm an infant’s eye;
7084,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Where generous beaux might gentle damsels please,"
7085,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And travellers call who cross the land or seas,"
7086,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And find the curious art, the neat device,"
7087,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Of precious value and of trifling price.
7088,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Here Conscience rested: she was pleased to find        150
7089,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,No less an active than an honest mind;
7090,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But, when he named his price, and when he swore,"
7091,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"His Conscience check’d him, that he ask’d no more--"
7092,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,When half he sought had been a large increase
7093,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,On fair demand--she could not rest in peace
7094,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"(Beside th’ affront to call th’ adviser in,"
7095,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Who would prevent, to justify the sin.)"
7096,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"She therefore told him, that “he vainly tried"
7097,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To soothe her anger, conscious that he lied;"
7098,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"If thus he grasp’d at such usurious gains,               160"
7099,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He must deserve, and should expect, her pains.”"
7100,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,The charge was strong; he would in part confess
7101,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Offence there was--but, who offended less?"
7102,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“What! is a mere assertion call’d a lie?
7103,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And if it be, are men compell’d to buy?"
7104,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"’Twas strange that Conscience on such points should dwell, }"
7105,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,While he was acting (he would call it) well;               }
7106,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He bought as others buy, he sold as others sell:           }"
7107,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"There was no fraud, and he demanded cause"
7108,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Why he was troubled, when he kept the laws?”             170"
7109,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“My laws?” said Conscience: “What,” said he, “are thine?"
7110,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Oral or written, human or divine?"
7111,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Show me the chapter, let me see the text;"
7112,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,By laws uncertain subjects are perplex’d;
7113,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Let me my finger on the statute lay,"
7114,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And I shall feel it duty to obey.”
7115,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Reflect,” said Conscience, “’twas your own desire"
7116,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,That I should warn you--does the compact tire?
7117,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Repent you this? then bid me not advise,"
7118,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And rather hear your passions as they rise;              180
7119,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"So you may counsel and remonstrance shun,"
7120,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,But then remember it is war begun;
7121,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And you may judge from some attacks, my friend,"
7122,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,What serious conflicts will on war attend.”
7123,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Nay, but,” at length the thoughtful man replied,"
7124,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“I say not that; I wish you for my guide;
7125,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Wish for your checks and your reproofs--but then
7126,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Be like a Conscience of my fellow-men;
7127,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Worthy I mean, and men of good report,"
7128,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And not the wretches who with conscience sport.          190
7129,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"There’s Bice, my friend, who passes off his grease"
7130,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Of pigs for bears’, in pots a crown apiece;"
7131,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,His Conscience never checks him when he swears
7132,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,The fat he sells is honest fat of bears;
7133,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And so it is, for he contrives to give"
7134,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,A drachm to each--’tis thus that tradesmen live:
7135,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Now why should you and I be over-nice;
7136,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,What man is held in more repute than Bice?”
7137,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Here ended the dispute; but yet ’twas plain
7138,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,The parties both expected strife again.                  200
7139,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Their friendship cool’d, he look’d about and saw"
7140,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Numbers who seem’d unshackled by his awe;
7141,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"While like a school-boy he was threaten’d still,"
7142,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Now for the deed, now only for the will;"
7143,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Here Conscience answer’d, “To thy neighbour’s guide"
7144,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Thy neighbour leave, and in thine own confide.”"
7145,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Such were each day the charges and replies,"
7146,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,When a new object caught the trader’s eyes;
7147,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"A vestry-patriot, could he gain the name,"
7148,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Would famous make him, and would pay the fame.           210"
7149,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,He knew full well the sums bequeath’d in charge
7150,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"For schools, for alms-men, for the poor, were large;"
7151,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Report had told, and he could feel it true,"
7152,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,That most unfairly dealt the trusted few;
7153,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"No partners would they in their office take,"
7154,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Nor clear accounts at annual meetings make;
7155,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Aloud our hero in the vestry spoke
7156,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Of hidden deeds, and vow’d to draw the cloak;"
7157,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"It was the poor man’s cause, and he for one"
7158,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Was quite determined to see justice done.                220
7159,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"His foes affected laughter, then disdain,              }"
7160,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"They too were loud and threat’ning, but in vain;       }"
7161,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The pauper’s friend, their foe, arose and spoke again. }"
7162,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fiercely he cried, “Your garbled statements show"
7163,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,That you determine we shall nothing know;
7164,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But we shall bring your hidden crimes to light,"
7165,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Give you to shame, and to the poor their right.”"
7166,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Virtue like this might some approval ask--
7167,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But Conscience sternly said, “You wear a mask!”"
7168,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“At least,” said Fulham, “if I have a view               230"
7169,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To serve myself, I serve the public too.”"
7170,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fulham, though check’d, retain’d his former zeal,"
7171,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And this the cautious rogues began to feel.
7172,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Thus will he ever bark,” in peevish tone"
7173,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,An elder cried--“the cur must have a bone.”
7174,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,They then began to hint--and to begin
7175,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Was all they needed: it was felt within;
7176,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"In terms less veil’d an offer then was made,"
7177,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Though distant still, it fail’d not to persuade;"
7178,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"More plainly then was every point proposed,              240"
7179,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Approved, accepted, and the bargain closed."
7180,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Th’ exulting paupers hail’d their friend’s success,"
7181,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And bade adieu to murmurs and distress.”
7182,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Alas! their friend had now superior light,"
7183,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And, view’d by that, he found that all was right;"
7184,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“There were no errors, the disbursements small;"
7185,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"This was the truth, and truth was due to all.”"
7186,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And rested Conscience? No! she would not rest,"
7187,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Yet was content with making a protest.
7188,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Some acts she now with less resistance bore,             250"
7189,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Nor took alarm so quickly as before;
7190,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Like those in towns besieged, who every ball"
7191,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"At first with terror view, and dread them all;"
7192,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But, grown familiar with the scenes, they fear"
7193,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The danger less, as it approaches near:"
7194,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"So Conscience, more familiar with the view"
7195,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Of growing evils, less attentive grew;"
7196,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Yet he who felt some pain, and dreaded more,"
7197,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Gave a peace-offering to the angry poor.
7198,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Thus had he quiet--but the time was brief,             260"
7199,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,From his new triumph sprang a cause of grief;
7200,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"In office join’d, and acting with the rest,"
7201,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,He must admit the sacramental test.
7202,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Now, as a sectary, who had all his life,"
7203,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"As he supposed, been with the church at strife"
7204,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"(No rules of hers, no laws had he perused,"
7205,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Nor knew the tenets he by rote abused);
7206,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Yet Conscience here arose more fierce and strong,"
7207,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Than when she told of robbery and wrong;
7208,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“Change his religion! No! he must be sure                270
7209,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,That was a blow no conscience could endure.”
7210,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Though friend to virtue, yet she oft abides"
7211,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"In early notions, fix’d by erring guides,"
7212,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And is more startled by a call from those,"
7213,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Than when the foulest crimes her rest oppose;
7214,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"By error taught, by prejudice misled,"
7215,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"She yields her rights, and fancy rules instead;"
7216,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"When Conscience all her stings and terror deals,"
7217,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Not as truth dictates, but as fancy feels;"
7218,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And thus within our hero’s troubled breast,              280"
7219,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Crime was less torture than the odious test.
7220,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"New forms, new measures, he must now embrace,"
7221,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,With sad conviction that they warr’d with grace;
7222,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To his new church no former friend would come,"
7223,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,They scarce preferr’d her to the church of Rome.
7224,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But, thinking much, and weighing guilt and gain,"
7225,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Conscience and he commuted for her pain;
7226,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Then promised Fulham to retain his creed,"
7227,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And their peculiar paupers still to feed;
7228,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Their attic-room (in secret) to attend,                 290"
7229,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And not forget he was the preacher’s friend;
7230,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Thus he proposed, and Conscience, troubled, tried,"
7231,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And wanting peace, reluctantly complied."
7232,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Now care subdued, and apprehensions gone,"
7233,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,In peace our hero went aspiring on;
7234,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But short the period--soon a quarrel rose,"
7235,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fierce in the birth, and fatal in the close;"
7236,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"With times of truce between, which rather proved"
7237,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"That both were weary, than that either loved."
7238,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fulham ev’n now disliked the heavy thrall, }           300"
7239,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And for her death would in his anguish call, }"
7240,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"As Rome’s mistaken friend exclaim’d,         }"
7241,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,_Let Carthage fall_!              }
7242,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"So felt our hero, so his wish express’d,"
7243,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Against this powerful sprite--_delenda est_.
7244,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Rome in her conquest saw not danger near,"
7245,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Freed from her rival, and without a fear;"
7246,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"So, Conscience conquer’d, men perceive how free,"
7247,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But not how fatal, such a state must be."
7248,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fatal, not free, our hero’s: foe or friend,"
7249,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Conscience on him was destined to attend;                310
7250,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"She [dozed] indeed, grew dull, nor seem’d to spy"
7251,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Crime following crime, and each of deeper dye;"
7252,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But all were noticed, and the reckoning time"
7253,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,With her account came on--crime following crime.
7254,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"This, once a foe, now brother in the trust,"
7255,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Whom Fulham late described as fair and just,"
7256,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Was the sole guardian of a wealthy maid,"
7257,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Placed in his power, and of his frown afraid:"
7258,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Not quite an idiot, for her busy brain"
7259,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Sought, by poor cunning, trifling points to gain;        320"
7260,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Success in childish projects her delight,"
7261,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,She took no heed of each important right.
7262,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The friendly parties met--the guardian cried,"
7263,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“I am too old; my sons have each a bride:
7264,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Martha, my ward, would make an easy wife;"
7265,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,On easy terms I’ll make her yours for life;
7266,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And then the creature is so weak and mild,"
7267,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,She may be soothed and threaten’d as a child--”
7268,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Yet not obey,” said Fulham, “for your fools,"
7269,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Female and male, are obstinate as mules.”                330"
7270,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Some points adjusted, these new friends agreed,"
7271,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Proposed the day, and hurried on the deed."
7272,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“’Tis a vile act,” said Conscience;--“It will prove,”"
7273,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Replied the bolder man, “an act of love;"
7274,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Her wicked guardian might the girl have sold
7275,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,To endless misery for a tyrant’s gold;
7276,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Now may her life be happy--for I mean
7277,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,To keep my temper even and serene.”
7278,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“I cannot thus compound,” the spirit cried,"
7279,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“Nor have my laws thus broken and defied;                340
7280,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"This is a fraud, a bargain for a wife;"
7281,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Expect my vengeance, or amend your life.”"
7282,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The wife was pretty, trifling, childish, weak;"
7283,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"She could not think, but would not cease to speak."
7284,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"This he forbad--she took the caution ill,"
7285,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And boldly rose against his sovereign will;
7286,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"With idiot-cunning she would watch the hour,"
7287,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"When friends were present, to dispute his power:"
7288,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"With tyrant-craft, he then was still and calm,"
7289,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,But raised in private terror and alarm:                  350
7290,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"By many trials, she perceived how far"
7291,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To vex and tease, without an open war;"
7292,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And he discover’d that so weak a mind
7293,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"No art could lead, and no compulsion bind;"
7294,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The rudest force would fail such mind to tame,"
7295,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And she was callous to rebuke and shame;
7296,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Proud of her wealth, the power of law she knew,"
7297,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And would assist him in the spending too.
7298,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"His threat’ning words with insult she defied,"
7299,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,To all his reasoning with a stare replied;               360
7300,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And when he begg’d her to attend, would say,"
7301,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“Attend I will--but let me have my way.”
7302,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Nor rest had Conscience: “While you merit pain
7303,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"From me,” she cried, “you seek redress in vain.”"
7304,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,His thoughts were grievous: “All that I possess
7305,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,From this vile bargain adds to my distress;
7306,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To pass a life with one who will not mend,   }"
7307,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Who cannot love, nor save, nor wisely spend, }"
7308,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Is a vile prospect, and I see no end;        }"
7309,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"For if we part, I must of course restore                 370"
7310,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Much of her money, and must wed no more."
7311,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Is there no way?”--here Conscience rose in power,"
7312,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“Oh! fly the danger of this fatal hour;
7313,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"I am thy Conscience, faithful, fond, and true,"
7314,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Ah, fly this thought, or evil must ensue;"
7315,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fall on thy knees, and pray with all thy soul,"
7316,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Thy purpose banish, thy design control;"
7317,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Let every hope of such advantage cease,"
7318,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Or never more expect a moment’s peace.”
7319,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Th’ affrighten’d man a due attention paid,             380"
7320,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Felt the rebuke, and the command obey’d."
7321,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Again the wife rebell’d, again express’d"
7322,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,A love for pleasure--a contempt of rest;
7323,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“She, whom she pleased, would visit, would receive"
7324,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Those who pleased her, nor deign to ask for leave.”"
7325,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“One way there is,” said he; “I might contrive"
7326,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Into a trap this foolish thing to drive:
7327,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Who pleased her, said she?--I’ll be certain who--”"
7328,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Take heed,” said Conscience, “what thou mean’st to do:"
7329,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Ensnare thy wife?”--“Why yes,” he must confess,          390"
7330,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“It might be wrong--but there was no redress;
7331,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Beside, to think,” said he, “is not to sin.”"
7332,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“Mistaken man!” replied the power within.
7333,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"No guest unnoticed to the lady came,"
7334,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,He judged th’ event with mingled joy and shame;
7335,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Oft he withdrew, and seem’d to leave her free."
7336,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,But still as watchful as a lynx was he;
7337,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Meanwhile the wife was thoughtless, cool, and gay,"
7338,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And, without virtue, had no wish to stray."
7339,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Though thus opposed, his plans were not resign’d;      400"
7340,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Revenge,” said he, “will prompt that daring mind;"
7341,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Refused supplies, insulted and distress’d,"
7342,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Enraged with me, and near a favourite guest--"
7343,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Then will her vengeance prompt the daring deed,"
7344,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And I shall watch, detect her, and be freed.”"
7345,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"There was a youth--but let me hide the name,"
7346,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,With all the progress of this deed of shame;
7347,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,He had his views--on him the husband cast
7348,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"His net, and saw him in his trammels fast."
7349,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Pause but a moment--think what you intend,”           410"
7350,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Said the roused sleeper; “I am yet a friend;
7351,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Must all our days in enmity be spent?”
7352,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“No!” and he paused--“I surely shall repent:”
7353,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Then hurried on--the evil plan was laid,               }"
7354,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The wife was guilty, and her friend betray’d,          }"
7355,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And Fulham gain’d his wish, and for his will was paid. }"
7356,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Had crimes less weighty on the spirit press’d,"
7357,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,This troubled Conscience might have sunk to rest;
7358,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And, like a foolish guard, been bribed to peace,"
7359,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"By a false promise, that offence should cease;           420"
7360,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Past faults had seem’d familiar to the view,"
7361,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Confused if many, and obscure though true;"
7362,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And Conscience, troubled with the dull account,"
7363,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Had dropp’d her tale, and slumber’d o’er th’ amount."
7364,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But, struck by daring guilt, alert she rose,"
7365,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Disturbed, alarm’d, and could no more repose;"
7366,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"All hopes of friendship, and of peace, were past,"
7367,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And every view with gloom was overcast.
7368,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Hence from that day, that day of shame and sin,"
7369,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Arose the restless enmity within;                        430
7370,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"On no resource could Fulham now rely,"
7371,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Doom’d all expedients, and in vain, to try;"
7372,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"For Conscience, roused, sat boldly on her throne,      }"
7373,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Watch’d every thought, attack’d the foe alone,         }"
7374,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And with envenom’d sting drew forth the inward groan:  }
7375,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Expedients fail’d that brought relief before,        }"
7376,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,In vain his alms gave comfort to the poor:           }
7377,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Give what he would, to him the comfort came no more. }"
7378,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Not prayer avail’d, and when (his crimes confess’d)"
7379,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He felt some ease, she said--“are they redress’d?        440"
7380,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"You still retain the profit, and be sure,"
7381,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Long as it lasts, this anguish shall endure.”"
7382,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fulham still tried to soothe her, cheat, mislead;       }"
7383,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But Conscience laid her finger on the deed,               }"
7384,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"And read the crime with power, and all that must succeed. }"
7385,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He tried t’ expel her, but was sure to find"
7386,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Her strength increased by all that he design’d;
7387,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Nor ever was his groan more loud and deep,"
7388,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Than when refresh’d she rose from momentary sleep.
7389,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Now desperate grown, weak, harass’d, and afraid,       450"
7390,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,From new allies he sought for doubtful aid;
7391,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To thought itself he strove to bid adieu,"
7392,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And from devotions to diversions flew;
7393,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He took a poor domestic for a slave,"
7394,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,(Though Avarice grieved to see the price he gave);
7395,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Upon his board, once frugal, press’d a load"
7396,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Of viands rich, the appetite to goad;"
7397,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The long-protracted meal, the sparkling cup,"
7398,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Fought with his gloom, and kept his courage up;"
7399,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Soon as the morning came, there met his eyes             460"
7400,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Accounts of wealth, that he might reading rise;"
7401,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"To profit then he gave some active hours,"
7402,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Till food and wine again should renovate his powers.
7403,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Yet, spite of all defence, of every aid,"
7404,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,The watchful foe her close attention paid;
7405,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"In every thoughtful moment, on she press’d,"
7406,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And gave at once her dagger to his breast;
7407,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"He waked at midnight, and the fears of sin,"
7408,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"As waters through a bursten dam, broke in;"
7409,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Nay, in the banquet, with his friends around,            470"
7410,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"When all their cares and half their crimes were drown’d,"
7411,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Would some chance act awake the slumbering fear,"
7412,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And care and crime in all their strength appear:
7413,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The news is read, a guilty victim swings,"
7414,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And troubled looks proclaim the bosom-stings;
7415,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Some pair are wed; this brings the wife in view,"
7416,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,And some divorced: this shows the parting too;
7417,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Nor can he hear of evil word or deed,"
7418,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But they to thought, and thought to sufferings lead."
7419,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Such was his life--no other changes came,              480"
7420,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The hurrying day, the conscious night the same;"
7421,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"The night of horror--when he, starting, cried"
7422,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,To the poor startled sinner at his side:
7423,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,“Is it in law? am I condemn’d to die?
7424,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Let me escape!--I’ll give--oh! let me fly--
7425,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,How! but a dream--no judges! dungeon! chain!
7426,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Or these grim men!--I will not sleep again.--
7427,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Wilt thou, dread being! thus thy promise keep?"
7428,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Day is thy time--and wilt thou murder sleep?
7429,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Sorrow and want repose, and wilt thou come,              490"
7430,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,Nor give one hour of pure untroubled gloom?
7431,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"“Oh! Conscience! Conscience! man’s most faithful friend,"
7432,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"Him canst thou comfort, ease, relieve, defend;"
7433,_THE STRUGGLES OF CONSCIENCE._,"But if he will thy friendly checks forego,"

7524,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The rector’s harshness, and the mischief made"
7525,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,By chiding those whom preachers should persuade:
7526,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"This led the youth to views of easy life,"
7527,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A friendly patron, an obliging wife;"
7528,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"His tithe, his glebe, the garden and the steed,"
7529,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,With books as many as he wish’d to read.
7530,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,All this accorded with the uncle’s will;
7531,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"He loved a priest compliant, easy, still;"
7532,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Sums he had often to his favourite sent,                  70"
7533,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“To be,” he wrote, “in manly freedom spent;"
7534,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,For well it pleased his spirit to assist
7535,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"An honest lad, who scorn’d a Methodist.”"
7536,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"His mother too, in her maternal care,"
7537,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Bade him of canting hypocrites beware;
7538,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Who from his duties would his heart seduce,"
7539,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And make his talents of no earthly use.
7540,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Soon must a trial of his worth be made--
7541,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The ancient priest is to the tomb convey’d;
7542,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And the youth summon’d from a serious friend,             80"
7543,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"His guide and host, new duties to attend."
7544,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Three months before, the nephew and the ’squire"
7545,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Saw mutual worth to praise and to admire;
7546,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And though the one too early left his wine,"
7547,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The other still exclaim’d--“My boy will shine:
7548,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Yes, I perceive that he will soon improve,"
7549,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And I shall form the very guide I love;
7550,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Decent abroad, he will my name defend,"
7551,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And, when at home, be social and unbend.”"
7552,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The plan was specious, for the mind of James            90"
7553,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Accorded duly with his uncle’s schemes:
7554,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,He then aspired not to a higher name
7555,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Than sober clerks of moderate talents claim;
7556,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Gravely to pray, and rev’rendly to preach,"
7557,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Was all he saw, good youth! within his reach."
7558,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Thus may a mass of sulphur long abide,"
7559,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Cold and inert, but, to the flame applied,"
7560,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Kindling it blazes, and consuming turns"
7561,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"To smoke and poison, as it boils and burns."
7562,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"James, leaving college, to a preacher stray’d;         100"
7563,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"What call’d, he knew not--but the call obey’d,"
7564,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Mild, idle, pensive, ever led by those"
7565,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Who could some specious novelty propose;
7566,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Humbly he listen’d, while the preacher dwelt"
7567,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"On touching themes, and strong emotions felt;"
7568,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And in this night was fix’d that pliant will
7569,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"To one sole point, and he retains it still."
7570,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,At first his care was to himself confined;
7571,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Himself assured, he gave it to mankind:"
7572,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"His zeal grew active--honest, earnest zeal,              110"
7573,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And comfort dealt to him, he long’d to deal;"
7574,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"He to his favourite preacher now withdrew,"
7575,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Was taught to teach, instructed to subdue;"
7576,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And train’d for ghostly warfare, when the call"
7577,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Of his new duties reach’d him from the hall.
7578,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Now to the ’squire, although alert and stout,"
7579,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Came unexpected an attack of gout;
7580,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And the grieved patron felt such serious pain,"
7581,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,He never thought to see a church again.
7582,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Thrice had the youthful rector taught the crowd,         120"
7583,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Whose growing numbers spoke his powers aloud,"
7584,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Before the patron could himself rejoice
7585,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,(His pain still lingering) in the general voice;
7586,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,For he imputed all this early fame
7587,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"To graceful manner, and the well-known name;"
7588,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And to himself assumed a share of praise,"
7589,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,For worth and talents he was pleased to raise.
7590,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A month had flown, and with it fled disease;"
7591,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"What pleased before, began again to please;"
7592,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Emerging daily from his chamber’s gloom,                 130"
7593,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,He found his old sensations hurrying home;
7594,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Then call’d his nephew, and exclaim’d, “My boy,"
7595,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Let us again the balm of life enjoy;
7596,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The foe has left me, and I deem it right,"
7597,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Should he return, to arm me for the fight.”"
7598,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Thus spoke the ’squire, the favourite nymph stood by,"
7599,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And view’d the priest with insult in her eye.
7600,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,She thrice had heard him when he boldly spoke
7601,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"On dangerous points, and fear’d he would revoke;"
7602,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"For James she loved not--and her manner told,            140"
7603,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,“This warm affection will be quickly cold.”
7604,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And still she fear’d impression might be made
7605,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Upon a subject nervous and decay’d;
7606,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"She knew her danger, and had no desire"
7607,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Of reformation in the gallant ’squire;
7608,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And felt an envious pleasure in her breast
7609,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,To see the rector daunted and distress’d.
7610,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Again the uncle to the youth applied--
7611,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“Cast, my dear lad, that cursed gloom aside:"
7612,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,There are for all things time and place; appear          150
7613,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Grave in your pulpit, and be merry here."
7614,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Now take your wine--for woes a sure resource,"
7615,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And the best prelude to a long discourse.”
7616,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"James half obey’d, but cast an angry eye"
7617,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"On the fair lass, who still stood watchful by;"
7618,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Resolving thus, “I have my fears--but still"
7619,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"I must perform my duties, and I will;"
7620,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"No love, no interest, shall my mind control;"
7621,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Better to lose my comforts than my soul;
7622,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Better my uncle’s favour to abjure,                      160"
7623,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Than the upbraidings of my heart endure.”
7624,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"He took his glass, and then address’d the ’squire:"
7625,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“I feel not well, permit me to retire.”"
7626,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The ’squire conceived that the ensuing day
7627,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Gave him these terrors for the grand essay,"
7628,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"When he himself should this young preacher try,"
7629,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And stand before him with observant eye;
7630,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"This raised compassion in his manly breast,"
7631,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And he would send the rector to his rest;
7632,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Yet first, in soothing voice--“A moment stay,            170"
7633,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And these suggestions of a friend obey;
7634,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Treasure these hints, if fame or peace you prize--"
7635,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The bottle emptied, I shall close my eyes."
7636,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“On every priest a two-fold care attends,"
7637,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"To prove his talents, and insure his friends:"
7638,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"First, of the first--your stores at once produce,"
7639,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And bring your reading to its proper use;
7640,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"On doctrines dwell, and every point enforce"
7641,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"By quoting much, the scholar’s sure resource;"
7642,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,For he alone can show us on each head                    180
7643,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,What ancient schoolmen and sage fathers said:
7644,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"No worth has knowledge, if you fail to show"
7645,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"How well you studied, and how much you know."
7646,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Is faith your subject, and you judge it right"
7647,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,On theme so dark to cast a ray of light:
7648,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Be it that faith the orthodox maintain,"
7649,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Found in the rubrick, what the creeds explain;"
7650,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Fail not to show us on this ancient faith
7651,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,(And quote the passage) what some martyr saith.
7652,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Dwell not one moment on a faith that shocks              190
7653,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The minds of men sincere and orthodox:
7654,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"That gloomy faith, that robs the wounded mind"
7655,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Of all the comfort it was wont to find
7656,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"From virtuous acts, and to the soul denies"
7657,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Its proper due for alms and charities;
7658,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"That partial faith, that, weighing sins alone,"
7659,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Lets not a virtue for a fault atone;
7660,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"That starving faith, that would our tables clear,"
7661,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And make one dreadful Lent of all the year;
7662,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And cruel too, for this is faith that rends              200"
7663,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Confiding beauties from protecting friends;
7664,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A faith that all embracing, what a gloom"
7665,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Deep and terrific o’er the land would come!
7666,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,What scenes of horror would that time disclose!
7667,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"No sight but misery, and no sound but woes;"
7668,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Your nobler faith, in loftier style convey’d,"
7669,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Shall be with praise and admiration paid.
7670,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,On points like these your hearers all admire
7671,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A preacher’s depth, and nothing more require;"
7672,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Shall we a studious youth to college send,               210"
7673,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,That every clown his words may comprehend?
7674,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"’Tis for your glory, when your hearers own"
7675,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Your learning matchless, but the sense unknown."
7676,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“Thus honour gain’d, learn now to gain a friend,"
7677,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And the sure way is--never to offend;
7678,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"For, James, consider--what your neighbours do"
7679,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Is their own business, and concerns not you."
7680,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Shun all resemblance to that forward race
7681,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Who preach of sins before a sinner’s face;
7682,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And seem as if they overlook’d a pew,                    220"
7683,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Only to drag a failing man in view.
7684,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Much should I feel, when groaning in disease,"
7685,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,If a rough hand upon my limb should seize;
7686,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"But great my anger, if this hand were found"
7687,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The very doctor’s, who should make it sound;"
7688,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"So feel our minds, young priest, so doubly feel,"
7689,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,When hurt by those whose office is to heal.
7690,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“Yet of our duties you must something tell,"
7691,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And must at times on sin and frailty dwell;
7692,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Here you may preach in easy, flowing style,              230"
7693,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"How errors cloud us, and how sins defile;"
7694,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Here bring persuasive tropes and figures forth,"
7695,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,To show the poor that wealth is nothing worth;
7696,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"That they, in fact, possess an ample share"
7697,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Of the world’s good, and feel not half its care;"
7698,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Give them this comfort, and, indeed, my gout"
7699,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,In its full vigour causes me some doubt;
7700,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And let it always, for your zeal, suffice,"
7701,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"That vice you combat, in the abstract--vice:"
7702,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The very captious will be quiet then;                    240
7703,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,We all confess we are offending men.
7704,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"In lashing sin, of every stroke beware,"
7705,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"For sinners feel, and sinners you must spare;"
7706,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"In general satire, every man perceives"
7707,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A slight attack, yet neither fears nor grieves;"
7708,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"But name th’ offence, and you absolve the rest,"
7709,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And point the dagger at a single breast.
7710,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“Yet are there sinners of a class so low,"
7711,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,That you with safety may the lash bestow:
7712,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Poachers, and drunkards, idle rogues, who feed           250"
7713,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"At others’ cost, a mark’d correction need;"
7714,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And all the better sort, who see your zeal,"
7715,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Will love and reverence for their pastor feel;
7716,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Reverence for one who can inflict the smart,"
7717,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And love, because he deals them not a part."
7718,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,“Remember well what love and age advise;
7719,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A quiet rector is a parish prize,"
7720,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Who in his learning has a decent pride;
7721,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Who to his people is a gentle guide;
7722,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Who only hints at failings that he sees;            }    260
7723,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Who loves his glebe, his patron, and his ease,      }"
7724,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And finds the way to fame and profit is to please.” }
7725,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The nephew answer’d not, except a sigh"
7726,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And look of sorrow might be term’d reply;
7727,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"He saw the fearful hazard of his state,"
7728,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And held with truth and safety strong debate;
7729,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Nor long he reason’d, for the zealous youth"
7730,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Resolved, though timid, to profess the truth;"
7731,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And, though his friend should like a lion roar,"
7732,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Truth would he preach, and neither less nor more.        270"
7733,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The bells had toll’d--arrived the time of prayer,"
7734,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The flock assembled, and the ’squire was there:"
7735,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And now can poet sing, or proseman say,"
7736,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The disappointment of that trying day?
7737,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,As he who long had train’d a favourite steed
7738,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"(Whose blood and bone gave promise of his speed),"
7739,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Sanguine with hope, he runs with partial eye"
7740,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"O’er every feature, and his bets are high;"
7741,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Of triumph sure, he sees the rivals start,"
7742,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And waits their coming with exulting heart;              280
7743,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Forestalling glory, with impatient glance,"
7744,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And sure to see his conquering steed advance;
7745,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The conquering steed advances--luckless day!
7746,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,A rival’s Herod bears the prize away;
7747,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Nor second his, nor third, but lagging last,"
7748,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"With hanging head he comes, by all surpass’d;"
7749,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Surprise and wrath the owner’s mind inflame,"
7750,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Love turns to scorn, and glory ends in shame:--"
7751,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Thus waited, high in hope, the partial ’squire,"
7752,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Eager to hear, impatient to admire.                      290"
7753,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,When the young preacher in the tones that find
7754,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A certain passage to the kindling mind,"
7755,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"With air and accent strange, impressive, sad,"
7756,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Alarm’d the judge--he trembled for the lad;
7757,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"But when the text announced the power of grace, }"
7758,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Amazement scowl’d upon his clouded face,        }"
7759,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,At this degenerate son of his illustrious race; }
7760,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Staring he stood, till hope again arose,"
7761,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,That James might well define the words he chose:
7762,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"For this he listen’d--but, alas! he found                300"
7763,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The preacher always on forbidden ground.
7764,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And now the uncle left the hated pew,"
7765,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"With James, and James’s conduct in his view."
7766,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,A long farewell to all his favourite schemes! }
7767,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,For now no crazed fanatic’s frantic dreams    }
7768,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Seem’d vile as James’s conduct, or as James.  }"
7769,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"All he had long derided, hated, fear’d,"
7770,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,This from the chosen youth the uncle heard--
7771,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The needless pause, the fierce disorder’d air,"
7772,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"The groan for sin, the vehemence of prayer,              310"
7773,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Gave birth to wrath, that, in a long discourse"
7774,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Of grace, triumphant rose to four-fold force."
7775,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"He found his thoughts despised, his rules transgress’d; }"
7776,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And, while the anger kindled in his breast,             }"
7777,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The pain must be endured that could not be express’d.   }
7778,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Each new idea more inflamed his ire,"
7779,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,As fuel thrown upon a rising fire:
7780,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"A hearer yet, he sought by threatening sign"
7781,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"To ease his heart, and awe the young divine;"
7782,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"But James refused those angry looks to meet,             320"
7783,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Till he dismiss’d his flock, and left his seat."
7784,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Exhausted then he felt his trembling frame,"
7785,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,But fix’d his soul--his sentiments the same;
7786,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"And therefore wise it seem’d to fly from rage,"
7787,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And seek for shelter in his parsonage:
7788,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"There, if forsaken, yet consoled to find"
7789,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Some comforts left, though not a few resign’d;"

7815,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Yes, he had listen’d, who had slumber’d long,"
7816,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,And was convinced that something must be wrong;
7817,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"But, though affected, still his yielding heart,"

7832,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Had no such strictness--they might drink and dine,       370"
7833,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"For them sufficient--but he said before,"
7834,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"That truth was truth, and he would drink no more.”"
7835,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,This heard the ’squire with mix’d contempt and pain;

7841,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"“It was the wretched life his Honour led,"

7844,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The thought had made her!) were as yet unbless’d:

7846,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,The wrath that forced her trembling to withdraw.
7847,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Add to these outward ills some inward light,"
7848,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,That show’d him all was not correct and right:
7849,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Though now he less indulged--and to the poor,"
7850,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"From day to day, sent alms from door to door;"
7851,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,"Though he some ease from easy virtues found,"
7852,_THE ’SQUIRE AND THE PRIEST._,Yet conscience told him he could not compound;           390

7913,_THE CONFIDANT._,Anna was young and lovely--in her eye
7914,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The glance of beauty, in her cheek the dye;"
7915,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her shape was slender, and her features small,"
7916,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But graceful, easy, unaffected all."
7917,_THE CONFIDANT._,The liveliest tints her youthful face disclosed;
7918,_THE CONFIDANT._,"There beauty sparkled, and there health reposed;"
7919,_THE CONFIDANT._,For the pure blood that flush’d that rosy cheek
7920,_THE CONFIDANT._,Spoke what the heart forbad the tongue to speak;
7921,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And told the feelings of that heart as well,"
7922,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Nay, with more candour than the tongue could tell.        10"
7923,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Though this fair lass had with the wealthy dwelt,"
7924,_THE CONFIDANT._,Yet like the damsel of the cot she felt;
7925,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And, at the distant hint or dark surmise,"
7926,_THE CONFIDANT._,The blood into the mantling cheek would rise.
7927,_THE CONFIDANT._,Now Anna’s station frequent terrors wrought
7928,_THE CONFIDANT._,In one whose looks were with such meaning fraught;
7929,_THE CONFIDANT._,"For on a lady, as an humble friend,"
7930,_THE CONFIDANT._,It was her painful office to attend.
7931,_THE CONFIDANT._,Her duties here were of the usual kind--
7932,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And some the body harass’d, some the mind:                20"
7933,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Billets she wrote, and tender stories read,"
7934,_THE CONFIDANT._,To make the lady sleepy in her bed;
7935,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She play’d at whist, but with inferior skill,"
7936,_THE CONFIDANT._,And heard the summons as a call to drill;
7937,_THE CONFIDANT._,Music was ever pleasant till she play’d
7938,_THE CONFIDANT._,At a request that no request convey’d;
7939,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The lady’s tales with anxious looks she heard,"
7940,_THE CONFIDANT._,For she must witness what her friend averr’d;
7941,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The lady’s taste she must in all approve,"
7942,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Hate whom she hated, whom she loved must love;            30"
7943,_THE CONFIDANT._,"These, with the various duties of her place,"
7944,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With care she studied, and perform’d with grace;"
7945,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She veil’d her troubles in a mask of ease,"
7946,_THE CONFIDANT._,And show’d her pleasure was a power to please.
7947,_THE CONFIDANT._,Such were the damsel’s duties; she was poor--
7948,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Above a servant, but with service more."
7949,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Men on her face with careless freedom gazed,"
7950,_THE CONFIDANT._,Nor thought how painful was the glow they raised;
7951,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A wealthy few to gain her favour tried,"
7952,_THE CONFIDANT._,But not the favour of a grateful bride:                   40
7953,_THE CONFIDANT._,"They spoke their purpose with an easy air,"
7954,_THE CONFIDANT._,That shamed and frighten’d the dependent fair:
7955,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Past time she view’d, the passing time to cheat,"
7956,_THE CONFIDANT._,But nothing found to make the present sweet;
7957,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With pensive soul she read life’s future page,"
7958,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And saw dependent, poor, repining age."
7959,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But who shall dare t’ assert what _years_ may bring,"
7960,_THE CONFIDANT._,When wonders from the passing _hour_ may spring?--
7961,_THE CONFIDANT._,"There dwelt a yeoman in the place, whose mind"
7962,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Was gentle, generous, cultivated, kind;                   50"
7963,_THE CONFIDANT._,For thirty years he labour’d; fortune then
7964,_THE CONFIDANT._,Placed the mild rustic with superior men:
7965,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A richer Stafford, who had lived to save,"
7966,_THE CONFIDANT._,What he had treasured to the poorer gave;
7967,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Who with a sober mind that treasure view’d,"
7968,_THE CONFIDANT._,And the slight studies of his youth renew’d.
7969,_THE CONFIDANT._,"He not profoundly, but discreetly read,"
7970,_THE CONFIDANT._,And a fair mind with useful culture fed;
7971,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Then thought of marriage--“But the great,” said he,"
7972,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“I shall not suit, nor will the meaner me.”               60"
7973,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Anna he saw, admired her modest air;"
7974,_THE CONFIDANT._,"He thought her virtuous, and he knew her fair;"
7975,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Love raised his pity for her humble state,"
7976,_THE CONFIDANT._,And prompted wishes for her happier fate;
7977,_THE CONFIDANT._,"No pride in money would his feelings wound,"
7978,_THE CONFIDANT._,Nor vulgar manners hurt him and confound:
7979,_THE CONFIDANT._,"He then the lady at the hall address’d,"
7980,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Sought her consent, and his regard express’d;"
7981,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Yet, if some cause his earnest wish denied,"
7982,_THE CONFIDANT._,He begg’d to know it; and he bow’d and sigh’d.            70
7983,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The lady own’d that she was loth to part,"
7984,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But praised the damsel for her gentle heart,"
7985,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her pleasing person, and her blooming health;"
7986,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But ended thus, “Her virtue is her wealth.”"
7987,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Then is she rich!” he cried, with lively air;"
7988,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“But whence, so please you, came a lass so fair?”"
7989,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“A placeman’s child was Anna, one who died"
7990,_THE CONFIDANT._,And left a widow by afflictions tried;
7991,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She to support her infant daughter strove,"
7992,_THE CONFIDANT._,But early left the object of her love;                    80
7993,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her youth, her beauty, and her orphan-state"
7994,_THE CONFIDANT._,Gave a kind countess interest in her fate;
7995,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With her she dwelt, and still might dwelling be,"
7996,_THE CONFIDANT._,When the earl’s folly caused the lass to flee;
7997,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A second friend was she compell’d to shun,"
7998,_THE CONFIDANT._,By the rude offers of an uncheck’d son;
7999,_THE CONFIDANT._,"I found her then, and with a mother’s love"
8000,_THE CONFIDANT._,Regard the gentle girl whom you approve.
8001,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Yet, e’en with me, protection is not peace;"
8002,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Nor man’s designs, nor beauty’s trial, cease;             90"
8003,_THE CONFIDANT._,Like sordid boys by costly fruit they feel:
8004,_THE CONFIDANT._,"They will not purchase, but they try to steal.”"
8005,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Now this good lady, like a witness true,"
8006,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Told but the truth, and all the truth she knew;"
8007,_THE CONFIDANT._,And ’tis our duty and our pain to show
8008,_THE CONFIDANT._,Truth this good lady had not means to know.
8009,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Yes, there was lock’d within the damsel’s breast"
8010,_THE CONFIDANT._,A fact important to be now confess’d;
8011,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Gently, my muse, th’ afflicting tale relate,"
8012,_THE CONFIDANT._,And have some feeling for a sister’s fate.               100
8013,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Where Anna dwelt, a conquering hero came--"
8014,_THE CONFIDANT._,"An Irish captain, Sedley was his name;"
8015,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And he too had that same prevailing art,"
8016,_THE CONFIDANT._,That gave soft wishes to the virgin’s heart.
8017,_THE CONFIDANT._,In years they differ’d; he had thirty seen
8018,_THE CONFIDANT._,When this young beauty counted just fifteen;
8019,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But still they were a lovely lively pair,"
8020,_THE CONFIDANT._,And trod on earth as if they trod on air.
8021,_THE CONFIDANT._,"On love, delightful theme! the captain dwelt"
8022,_THE CONFIDANT._,With force still growing with the hopes he felt;         110
8023,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But with some caution and reluctance told,"
8024,_THE CONFIDANT._,"He had a father crafty, harsh, and old;"
8025,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Who, as possessing much, would much expect,"
8026,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Or both, for ever, from his love reject:"
8027,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Why then offence to one so powerful give,"
8028,_THE CONFIDANT._,Who (for their comfort) had not long to live?
8029,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With this poor prospect the deluded maid,"
8030,_THE CONFIDANT._,"In words confiding, was indeed betray’d;"
8031,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And, soon as terrors in her bosom rose,"
8032,_THE CONFIDANT._,The hero fled; they hinder’d his repose.                 120
8033,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Deprived of him, she to a parent’s breast"
8034,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her secret trusted, and her pains impress’d:"
8035,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Let her to town (so prudence urged) repair,"
8036,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To shun disgrace, at least to hide it there;"
8037,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But ere she went, the luckless damsel pray’d"
8038,_THE CONFIDANT._,A chosen friend might lend her timely aid:
8039,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Yes! my soul’s sister, my Eliza, come,"
8040,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Hear her last sigh, and ease thy Anna’s doom:”"
8041,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“’Tis a fool’s wish,” the angry father cried,"
8042,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But, lost in troubles of his own, complied;              130"
8043,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And dear Eliza to her friend was sent,"
8044,_THE CONFIDANT._,"T’ indulge that wish, and be her punishment:"
8045,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The time arrived, and brought a tenfold dread;"
8046,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The time was past, and all the terror fled;"
8047,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The infant died; the face resumed each charm,"
8048,_THE CONFIDANT._,And reason now brought trouble and alarm:
8049,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Should her Eliza--no! she was too just,"
8050,_THE CONFIDANT._,Too good and kind--but ah! too young to trust.”
8051,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Anna return’d, her former place resumed,"
8052,_THE CONFIDANT._,And faded beauty with new grace re-bloom’d;              140
8053,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And, if some whispers of the past were heard,"
8054,_THE CONFIDANT._,"They died innoxious, as no cause appear’d;"
8055,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But other cares on Anna’s bosom press’d,"
8056,_THE CONFIDANT._,She saw her father gloomy and distress’d;
8057,_THE CONFIDANT._,"He died o’erwhelm’d with debt, and soon was shed       }"
8058,_THE CONFIDANT._,The filial sorrow o’er a mother dead:                  }
8059,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She sought Eliza’s arms, that faithful friend was wed; }"
8060,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Then was compassion by the countess shown,"
8061,_THE CONFIDANT._,And all th’ adventures of her life are known.
8062,_THE CONFIDANT._,And now beyond her hopes--no longer tried              150
8063,_THE CONFIDANT._,By slavish awe--she lived a yeoman’s bride;
8064,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Then bless’d her lot, and with a grateful mind"
8065,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Was careful, cheerful, vigilant, and kind."
8066,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The gentle husband felt supreme delight,"
8067,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Bless’d by her joy, and happy in her sight;"
8068,_THE CONFIDANT._,He saw with pride in every friend and guest
8069,_THE CONFIDANT._,High admiration and regard express’d;
8070,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With greater pride, and with superior joy,"
8071,_THE CONFIDANT._,He look’d exulting on his first-born boy;
8072,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To her fond breast the wife her infant strain’d,         160"
8073,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Some feelings utter’d, some were not explain’d;"
8074,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And she enraptured with her treasure grew,"
8075,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The sight familiar, but the pleasure new."
8076,_THE CONFIDANT._,Yet there appear’d within that tranquil state
8077,_THE CONFIDANT._,Some threat’ning prospect of uncertain fate;
8078,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Between the married when a secret lies,"
8079,_THE CONFIDANT._,It wakes suspicion from enforced disguise.
8080,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Still thought the wife upon her absent friend,"
8081,_THE CONFIDANT._,With all that must upon her truth depend:
8082,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“There is no being in the world beside,                  170"
8083,_THE CONFIDANT._,Who can discover what that friend will hide;
8084,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Who knew the fact, knew not my name or state,"
8085,_THE CONFIDANT._,Who these can tell cannot the fact relate;
8086,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But thou, Eliza, canst the whole impart,"
8087,_THE CONFIDANT._,And all my safety is thy generous heart.”
8088,_THE CONFIDANT._,Mix’d with these fears--but light and transient these--
8089,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Fled years of peace, prosperity, and ease;"
8090,_THE CONFIDANT._,So tranquil all that scarce a gloomy day
8091,_THE CONFIDANT._,For days of gloom unmix’d prepared the way.
8092,_THE CONFIDANT._,"One eve, the wife, still happy in her state,             180"
8093,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Sang gaily, thoughtless of approaching fate;"
8094,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Then came a letter, that (received in dread"
8095,_THE CONFIDANT._,Not unobserved) she in confusion read;
8096,_THE CONFIDANT._,The substance this--“Her friend rejoiced to find
8097,_THE CONFIDANT._,That she had riches with a grateful mind;
8098,_THE CONFIDANT._,While poor Eliza had from place to place
8099,_THE CONFIDANT._,Been lured by hope to labour for disgrace;
8100,_THE CONFIDANT._,"That every scheme her wandering husband tried,"
8101,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Pain’d while he lived, and perish’d when he died.”"
8102,_THE CONFIDANT._,She then of want in angry style complain’d:    }         190
8103,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her child a burthen to her life remain’d,      }"
8104,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her kindred shunn’d her prayers, no friend her }"
8105,_THE CONFIDANT._,soul sustain’d.                     }
8106,_THE CONFIDANT._,“Yet why neglected? Dearest Anna knew
8107,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her worth once tried, her friendship ever true;"
8108,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She hoped, she trusted, though by wants oppress’d,"
8109,_THE CONFIDANT._,To lock the treasured secret in her breast;
8110,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Yet, vex’d by trouble, must apply to one,"
8111,_THE CONFIDANT._,For kindness due to her for kindness done.”
8112,_THE CONFIDANT._,In Anna’s mind was tumult; in her face
8113,_THE CONFIDANT._,Flushings of dread had momentary place.                  200
8114,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“I must,” she judged, “these cruel lines expose,"
8115,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Or fears, or worse than fears, my crime disclose.”"
8116,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The letter shown, he said, with sober smile--"
8117,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Anna, your friend has not a friendly style."
8118,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Say, where could you with this fair lady dwell,"
8119,_THE CONFIDANT._,Who boasts of secrets that she scorns to tell?”
8120,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“At school,” she answer’d; he “at school!” replied;"
8121,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Nay, then I know the secrets you would hide:"
8122,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Some [early] longings these, without dispute;"
8123,_THE CONFIDANT._,Some youthful gaspings for forbidden fruit.              210
8124,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Why so disorder’d, love? are such the crimes"
8125,_THE CONFIDANT._,That give us sorrow in our graver times?
8126,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Come, take a present for your friend, and rest"
8127,_THE CONFIDANT._,In perfect peace--you find you are confess’d.”
8128,_THE CONFIDANT._,"This cloud, though past, alarm’d the conscious wife,"
8129,_THE CONFIDANT._,Presaging gloom and sorrow for her life;
8130,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Who to her answer join’d a fervent prayer,"
8131,_THE CONFIDANT._,That her Eliza would a sister spare:
8132,_THE CONFIDANT._,"If she again--but was there cause?--should send,"
8133,_THE CONFIDANT._,Let her direct--and then she named a friend.--          220
8134,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A sad expedient, untried friends to trust,"
8135,_THE CONFIDANT._,And still to fear the tried may be unjust:
8136,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Such is his pain, who, by his debt oppress’d,"
8137,_THE CONFIDANT._,Seeks by new bonds a temporary rest.
8138,_THE CONFIDANT._,Few were her peaceful days till Anna read
8139,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The words she dreaded, and had cause to dread:--"
8140,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Did she believe, did she, unkind, suppose"
8141,_THE CONFIDANT._,That thus Eliza’s friendship was to close?
8142,_THE CONFIDANT._,"No! though she tried, and her desire was plain,"
8143,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To break the friendly bond, she strove in vain:          230"
8144,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Ask’d she for silence? why so loud the call,"
8145,_THE CONFIDANT._,And yet the token of her love so small?
8146,_THE CONFIDANT._,By means like these will you attempt to bind
8147,_THE CONFIDANT._,And check the movements of an injured mind?
8148,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Poor as I am, I shall be proud to show"
8149,_THE CONFIDANT._,What dangerous secrets I may safely know.
8150,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Secrets, to men of jealous minds convey’d,"
8151,_THE CONFIDANT._,Have many a noble house in ruins laid;
8152,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Anna, I trust, although with wrongs beset,"
8153,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And urged by want, I shall be faithful yet;              240"
8154,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But what temptation may from these arise,"
8155,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To take a slighted woman by surprise,"
8156,_THE CONFIDANT._,Becomes a subject for your serious care--
8157,_THE CONFIDANT._,"For who offends, must for offence prepare.”"
8158,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Perplex’d, dismay’d, the wife foresaw her doom;"
8159,_THE CONFIDANT._,A day deferr’d was yet a day to come;
8160,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But still, though painful her suspended state,"
8161,_THE CONFIDANT._,She dreaded more the crisis of her fate;
8162,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Better to die than Stafford’s scorn to meet,"
8163,_THE CONFIDANT._,And her strange friend perhaps would be discreet.        250
8164,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Presents she sent, and made a strong appeal"
8165,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To woman’s feelings, begging her to feel;"
8166,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With too much force she wrote of jealous men,"
8167,_THE CONFIDANT._,And her tears falling spoke beyond the pen;
8168,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Eliza’s silence she again implored,"
8169,_THE CONFIDANT._,And promised all that prudence could afford.
8170,_THE CONFIDANT._,For looks composed and careless Anna tried;
8171,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She seem’d in trouble, and unconscious sigh’d:"
8172,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The faithful husband, who devoutly loved"
8173,_THE CONFIDANT._,"His silent partner, with concern reproved:               260"
8174,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“What secret sorrows on my Anna press,"
8175,_THE CONFIDANT._,"That love may not partake, nor care redress?”"
8176,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“None, none,” she answer’d, with a look so kind,"
8177,_THE CONFIDANT._,That the fond man determined to be blind.
8178,_THE CONFIDANT._,A few succeeding weeks of brief repose
8179,_THE CONFIDANT._,In Anna’s cheek revived the faded rose;
8180,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A hue like this the western sky displays,"
8181,_THE CONFIDANT._,"That glows awhile, and withers as we gaze."
8182,_THE CONFIDANT._,Again the friend’s tormenting letter came--
8183,_THE CONFIDANT._,“The wants she suffer’d were affection’s shame;          270
8184,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She with her child a life of terrors led,"
8185,_THE CONFIDANT._,Unhappy fruit! but of a lawful bed.
8186,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her friend was tasting every bliss in life,"
8187,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The joyful mother, and the wealthy wife;"
8188,_THE CONFIDANT._,"While she was placed in doubt, in fear, in want,"
8189,_THE CONFIDANT._,To starve on trifles that the happy grant;
8190,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Poorly for all her faithful silence paid,"
8191,_THE CONFIDANT._,And tantalized by ineffectual aid.
8192,_THE CONFIDANT._,She could not thus a beggar’s lot endure;
8193,_THE CONFIDANT._,She wanted something permanent and sure:                 280
8194,_THE CONFIDANT._,"If they were friends, then equal be their lot,"
8195,_THE CONFIDANT._,And she was free to speak if they were not.”
8196,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Despair and terror seized the wife, to find"
8197,_THE CONFIDANT._,The artful workings of a vulgar mind:
8198,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Money she had not, but the hint of dress"
8199,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Taught her new bribes, new terrors to redress;"
8200,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She with such feeling then described her woes,"
8201,_THE CONFIDANT._,That envy’s self might on the view repose;
8202,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Then to a mother’s pains she made appeal,"
8203,_THE CONFIDANT._,And painted grief like one compell’d to feel.            290
8204,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Yes! so she felt, that in her air, her face,"
8205,_THE CONFIDANT._,"In every purpose, and in every place;"
8206,_THE CONFIDANT._,"In her slow motion, in her languid mien,"
8207,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The grief, the sickness of her soul were seen."
8208,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Of some mysterious ill the husband sure,"
8209,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Desired to trace it, for he hoped to cure;"
8210,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Something he knew obscurely, and had seen"
8211,_THE CONFIDANT._,His wife attend a cottage on the green;
8212,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Love, loth to wound, endured conjecture long,"
8213,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Till fear would speak, and spoke in language strong.     300"
8214,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“All I must know, my Anna--truly know"
8215,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Whence these emotions, terrors, troubles flow;"
8216,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Give me thy grief, and I will fairly prove"
8217,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Mine is no selfish, no ungenerous love.”"
8218,_THE CONFIDANT._,Now Anna’s soul the seat of strife became:
8219,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Fear with respect contended, love with shame;"
8220,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But fear, prevailing, was the ruling guide,"
8221,_THE CONFIDANT._,Prescribing what to show and what to hide.
8222,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“It is my friend,” she said--“but why disclose"
8223,_THE CONFIDANT._,A woman’s weakness struggling with her woes?             310
8224,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Yes, she has grieved me by her fond complaints,"
8225,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The wrongs she suffers, the distress she paints;"
8226,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Something we do--but she afflicts me still,"
8227,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And says, with power to help, I want the will."
8228,_THE CONFIDANT._,"This plaintive style I pity and excuse,"
8229,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Help when I can, and grieve when I refuse;"
8230,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But here my useless sorrows I resign,"
8231,_THE CONFIDANT._,And will be happy in a love like thine.”
8232,_THE CONFIDANT._,The husband doubted; he was kind but cool:--
8233,_THE CONFIDANT._,“’Tis a strong friendship to arise at school;           320
8234,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Once more then, love, once more the sufferer aid--"
8235,_THE CONFIDANT._,"I too can pity, but I must upbraid;"
8236,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Of these vain feelings then thy bosom free,"
8237,_THE CONFIDANT._,Nor be o’erwhelm’d by useless sympathy.”
8238,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The wife again despatch’d the useless bribe,"
8239,_THE CONFIDANT._,Again essay’d her terrors to describe;
8240,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Again with kindest words entreated peace,"
8241,_THE CONFIDANT._,And begg’d her offerings for a time might cease.
8242,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A calm succeeded, but too like the one"
8243,_THE CONFIDANT._,That causes terror ere the storm comes on:               330
8244,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A secret sorrow lived in Anna’s heart,"
8245,_THE CONFIDANT._,In Stafford’s mind a secret fear of art;
8246,_THE CONFIDANT._,Not long they lasted--this determined foe
8247,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Knew all her claims, and nothing would forego;"
8248,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Again her letter came, where Anna read,"
8249,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“My child, one cause of my distress, is dead;"
8250,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Heav’n has my infant.” “Heartless wretch!” she cried,"
8251,_THE CONFIDANT._,“Is this thy joy?”--“I am no longer tied:
8252,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Now will I, hast’ning to my friend, partake"
8253,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her cares and comforts, and no more forsake;             340"
8254,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Now shall we both in equal station move,"
8255,_THE CONFIDANT._,Save that my friend enjoys a husband’s love.”
8256,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Complaint and threats so strong the wife amazed,"
8257,_THE CONFIDANT._,Who wildly on her cottage-neighbour gazed;
8258,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her tones, her trembling, first betray’d her grief;"
8259,_THE CONFIDANT._,When floods of tears gave anguish its relief.
8260,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She fear’d that Stafford would refuse assent,"
8261,_THE CONFIDANT._,And knew her selfish friend would not relent;
8262,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She must petition, yet delay’d the task,"
8263,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Ashamed, afraid, and yet compell’d to ask;               350"
8264,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Unknown to him some object filled her mind,"
8265,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And, once suspicious, he became unkind.--"
8266,_THE CONFIDANT._,"They sate one evening, each absorb’d in gloom,              }"
8267,_THE CONFIDANT._,"When, hark! a noise and rushing to the room,                }"
8268,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The friend tripp’d lightly in, and laughing said, “I come.” }"
8269,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Anna received her with an anxious mind,"
8270,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And meeting whisper’d, “Is Eliza kind?”"
8271,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Reserved and cool, the husband sought to prove"
8272,_THE CONFIDANT._,The depth and force of this mysterious love.
8273,_THE CONFIDANT._,To nought that pass’d between the stranger-friend        360
8274,_THE CONFIDANT._,And his meek partner seem’d he to attend;
8275,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But, anxious, listen’d to the lightest word"
8276,_THE CONFIDANT._,That might some knowledge of his guest afford;
8277,_THE CONFIDANT._,And learn the reason one to him so dear
8278,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Should feel such fondness, yet betray such fear."
8279,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Soon he perceived this uninvited guest,"
8280,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Unwelcome too, a sovereign power possess’d;"
8281,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Lofty she was and careless, while the meek"
8282,_THE CONFIDANT._,And humbled Anna was afraid to speak:
8283,_THE CONFIDANT._,"As mute she listen’d with a painful smile,               370"
8284,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her friend sate laughing and at ease the while,"
8285,_THE CONFIDANT._,Telling her idle tales with all the glee
8286,_THE CONFIDANT._,Of careless and unfeeling levity.
8287,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With calm good sense he knew his wife endued,"
8288,_THE CONFIDANT._,And now with wounded pride her conduct view’d;
8289,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her speech was low, her every look convey’d--"
8290,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“I am a slave, subservient and afraid.”"
8291,_THE CONFIDANT._,All trace of comfort vanish’d if she spoke;
8292,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The noisy friend upon her purpose broke,"
8293,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To her remarks with insolence replied,                   380"
8294,_THE CONFIDANT._,And her assertions doubted or denied;
8295,_THE CONFIDANT._,"While the meek Anna like an infant shook,"
8296,_THE CONFIDANT._,Wo-struck and trembling at the serpent’s look.
8297,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“There is,” said Stafford, “yes, there is a cause--"
8298,_THE CONFIDANT._,"This creature frights her, overpowers and awes.”"
8299,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Six weeks had pass’d--“In truth, my love, this friend"
8300,_THE CONFIDANT._,Has liberal notions; what does she intend?
8301,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Without a hint she came, and will she stay"
8302,_THE CONFIDANT._,Till she receives the hint to go away?”
8303,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Confused the wife replied, in spite of truth,          390"
8304,_THE CONFIDANT._,“I love the dear companion of my youth.”
8305,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“’Tis well,” said Stafford; “then your loves renew;"
8306,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Trust me, your rivals, Anna, will be few.”"
8307,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Though playful this, she felt too much distress’d"
8308,_THE CONFIDANT._,T’ admit the consolation of a jest;
8309,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Ill she reposed, and in her dreams would sigh"
8310,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And, murmuring forth her anguish, beg to die;"
8311,_THE CONFIDANT._,"With sunken eye, slow pace, and pallid cheek,"
8312,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She look’d confusion, and she fear’d to speak."
8313,_THE CONFIDANT._,"All this the friend beheld, for, quick of sight,       400"
8314,_THE CONFIDANT._,She knew the husband eager for her flight;
8315,_THE CONFIDANT._,And that by force alone she could retain
8316,_THE CONFIDANT._,The lasting comforts she had hope to gain:
8317,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She now perceived, to win her post for life,"
8318,_THE CONFIDANT._,She must infuse fresh terrors in the wife;
8319,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Must bid to friendship’s feebler ties adieu,"
8320,_THE CONFIDANT._,And boldly claim the object in her view;
8321,_THE CONFIDANT._,"She saw the husband’s love, and knew the power"
8322,_THE CONFIDANT._,Her friend might use in some propitious hour.
8323,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Meantime the anxious wife, from pure distress          410"
8324,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Assuming courage, said, “I will confess;”"
8325,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But with her children felt a parent’s pride,"
8326,_THE CONFIDANT._,And sought once more the hated truth to hide.
8327,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Offended, grieved, impatient, Stafford bore"
8328,_THE CONFIDANT._,The odious change till he could bear no more.
8329,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A friend to truth, in speech and action plain,"
8330,_THE CONFIDANT._,He held all fraud and cunning in disdain;
8331,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But fraud to find, and falsehood to detect,"
8332,_THE CONFIDANT._,For once he fled to measures indirect.
8333,_THE CONFIDANT._,One day the friends were seated in that room           420
8334,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The guest with care adorn’d, and named her home."
8335,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To please the eye, there curious prints were placed,"
8336,_THE CONFIDANT._,And some light volumes to amuse the taste;
8337,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Letters and music, on a table laid,"
8338,_THE CONFIDANT._,The favourite studies of the fair betray’d;
8339,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Beneath the window was the toilet spread,"
8340,_THE CONFIDANT._,And the fire gleam’d upon a crimson bed.
8341,_THE CONFIDANT._,In Anna’s looks and falling tears were seen
8342,_THE CONFIDANT._,How interesting had their subjects been:
8343,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Oh! then,” resumed the friend, “I plainly find          430"
8344,_THE CONFIDANT._,That you and Stafford know each other’s mind;
8345,_THE CONFIDANT._,"I must depart, must on the world be thrown,"
8346,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Like one discarded, worthless and unknown;"
8347,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But shall I carry, and to please a foe,"
8348,_THE CONFIDANT._,A painful secret in my bosom? No!
8349,_THE CONFIDANT._,Think not your friend a reptile you may tread
8350,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Beneath your feet, and say, the worm is dead:"
8351,_THE CONFIDANT._,"I have some feeling, and will not be made"
8352,_THE CONFIDANT._,The scorn of her whom love cannot persuade.
8353,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Would not your word, your slightest wish, effect         440"
8354,_THE CONFIDANT._,"All that I hope, petition, or expect?"
8355,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The power you have, but you the use decline--"
8356,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Proof that you feel not, or you fear not mine."
8357,_THE CONFIDANT._,"There was a time, when I, a tender maid,"
8358,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Flew at a call, and your desires obey’d;"
8359,_THE CONFIDANT._,"A very mother to the child became,"
8360,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Consoled your sorrow, and conceal’d your shame;"
8361,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But now, grown rich and happy, from the door"
8362,_THE CONFIDANT._,"You thrust a bosom-friend, despised and poor;"
8363,_THE CONFIDANT._,"That child alive, its mother might have known            450"
8364,_THE CONFIDANT._,"The hard, ungrateful spirit she has shown.”"
8365,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Here paused the guest, and Anna cried at length--"
8366,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“You try me, cruel friend! beyond my strength;"
8367,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Would I had been beside my infant laid,"
8368,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Where none would vex me, threaten, or upbraid.”"
8369,_THE CONFIDANT._,In Anna’s looks the friend beheld despair;
8370,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Her speech she soften’d, and composed her air;"
8371,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Yet, while professing love, she answered still--"
8372,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“You can befriend me, but you want the will.”"
8373,_THE CONFIDANT._,"They parted thus, and Anna went her way,                 460"
8374,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To shed her secret sorrows, and to pray."
8375,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Stafford, amused with books, and fond of home,"
8376,_THE CONFIDANT._,By reading oft dispell’d the evening gloom;
8377,_THE CONFIDANT._,"History or tale--all heard him with delight,"
8378,_THE CONFIDANT._,And thus was pass’d this memorable night.
8379,_THE CONFIDANT._,The listening friend bestow’d a flattering smile;
8380,_THE CONFIDANT._,A sleeping boy the mother held the while;
8381,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And, ere she fondly bore him to his bed,"
8382,_THE CONFIDANT._,On his fair face the tear of anguish shed.
8383,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And now, his task resumed, “My tale,” said he,         470"
8384,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Is short and sad, short may our sadness be!”--"
8385,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“The Caliph Harun[8], as historians tell,"
8386,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Ruled, for a tyrant, admirably well;"
8387,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Where his own pleasures were not touch’d, to men"
8388,_THE CONFIDANT._,"He was humane, and sometimes even then."
8389,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Harun was fond of fruits, and gardens fair;"
8390,_THE CONFIDANT._,And wo to all whom he found poaching there.
8391,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Among his pages was a lively boy,"
8392,_THE CONFIDANT._,Eager in search of every trifling joy;
8393,_THE CONFIDANT._,"His feelings vivid, and his fancy strong,                480"
8394,_THE CONFIDANT._,He sigh’d for pleasure while he shrank from wrong;
8395,_THE CONFIDANT._,"When by the caliph in the garden placed,"
8396,_THE CONFIDANT._,He saw the treasures which he long’d to taste;
8397,_THE CONFIDANT._,And oft alone he ventured to behold
8398,_THE CONFIDANT._,Rich hanging fruits with rind of glowing gold;

8441,_THE CONFIDANT._,"‘Long have I waited, and the last supply"
8442,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Was but a pittance, yet how patient I!"
8443,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But, give me now what thy first terrors gave,            530"

8445,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Osmyn had found, in many a dreadful day,"
8446,_THE CONFIDANT._,The tyrant fiercer when he seem’d in play:

8448,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Spare me awhile, although ’tis pain to live."
8449,_THE CONFIDANT._,Oh! had that stolen fruit the power possess’d
8450,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To war with life, I now had been at rest.’"
8451,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“‘So fond of death,’ replied the boy, ’’tis plain"

8460,_THE CONFIDANT._,"That he was robb’d, although alone, he frown’d;"
8461,_THE CONFIDANT._,"And swore in wrath, that he would send the boy"
8462,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Far from his notice, favour, or employ;"
8463,_THE CONFIDANT._,"But gentler movements soothed his ruffled mind,          550"
8464,_THE CONFIDANT._,And his own failings taught him to be kind.
8465,_THE CONFIDANT._,"“Relenting thoughts then painted Osmyn young,"
8466,_THE CONFIDANT._,"His passion urgent, and temptation strong;"
8467,_THE CONFIDANT._,And that he suffer’d from that villain-spy
8468,_THE CONFIDANT._,Pains worse than death till he desired to die;
8469,_THE CONFIDANT._,"Then, if his morals had received a stain,"
8470,_THE CONFIDANT._,His bitter sorrows made him pure again;
8471,_THE CONFIDANT._,"To Reason Pity lent her generous aid,"
8472,_THE CONFIDANT._,"For one so tempted, troubled, and betray’d;"
8473,_THE CONFIDANT._,And a free pardon the glad boy restored                  560
8474,_THE CONFIDANT._,To the kind presence of a gentle lord;

8634,_RESENTMENT._,"Would she be his?”--“Why, that was much to say;"
8635,_RESENTMENT._,She would consider; he awhile might stay;
8636,_RESENTMENT._,"She liked his manners, and believed his word;"
8637,_RESENTMENT._,"He did not flatter, flattery she abhorr’d;"
8638,_RESENTMENT._,It was her happy lot in peace to dwell--
8639,_RESENTMENT._,Would change make better what was now so well?
8640,_RESENTMENT._,"But she would ponder.”---“This,” he said, “was kind,”    100"

8723,_RESENTMENT._,And her affliction should be all her own.
8724,_RESENTMENT._,"His wants and weakness might have touch’d her heart,"
8725,_RESENTMENT._,But from his meanness she resolved to part.”
8726,_RESENTMENT._,"In a small alley was she lodged, beside"
8727,_RESENTMENT._,"Its humblest poor, and at the view she cried:"
8728,_RESENTMENT._,"“Welcome--yes! let me welcome, if I can,"
8729,_RESENTMENT._,The fortune dealt me by this cruel man;
8730,_RESENTMENT._,"Welcome this low thatch’d roof, this shatter’d door,     190"
8731,_RESENTMENT._,"These walls of clay, this miserable floor;"
8732,_RESENTMENT._,"Welcome my envied neighbours; this, to you,"
8733,_RESENTMENT._,Is all familiar--all to me is new.
8734,_RESENTMENT._,You have no hatred to the loathsome meal;         }
8735,_RESENTMENT._,"Your firmer nerves no trembling terrors feel,     }"
8736,_RESENTMENT._,"Nor, what you must expose, desire you to conceal; }"
8737,_RESENTMENT._,"What your coarse feelings bear without offence,"
8738,_RESENTMENT._,"Disgusts my taste, and poisons every sense."
8739,_RESENTMENT._,"Daily shall I your sad relations hear,"
8740,_RESENTMENT._,"Of wanton women, and of men severe;                      200"
8741,_RESENTMENT._,"There will dire curses, dreadful oaths abound,"
8742,_RESENTMENT._,And vile expressions shock me and confound;
8743,_RESENTMENT._,"Noise of dull wheels, and songs with horrid words,"
8744,_RESENTMENT._,Will be the music that this lane affords;
8745,_RESENTMENT._,"Mirth that disgusts, and quarrels that degrade"
8746,_RESENTMENT._,"The human mind, must my retreat invade."
8747,_RESENTMENT._,"Hard is my fate! yet easier to sustain,"
8748,_RESENTMENT._,"Than to abide with guilt and fraud again,"
8749,_RESENTMENT._,"A grave impostor--who expects to meet,"
8750,_RESENTMENT._,"In such grey locks and gravity, deceit?                  210"
8751,_RESENTMENT._,"Where the sea rages, and the billows roar,"
8752,_RESENTMENT._,"Men know the danger, and they quit the shore;"
8753,_RESENTMENT._,"But, be there nothing in the way descried,"
8754,_RESENTMENT._,When o’er the rocks smooth runs the wicked tide--
8755,_RESENTMENT._,"Sinking unwarn’d, they execrate the shock,"
8756,_RESENTMENT._,And the dread peril of the sunken rock.”
8757,_RESENTMENT._,"A frowning world had now the man to dread,"
8758,_RESENTMENT._,"Taught in no arts, to no profession bred;"
8759,_RESENTMENT._,"Pining in grief, beset with constant care,"
8760,_RESENTMENT._,"Wandering he went, to rest he knew not where.            220"
8761,_RESENTMENT._,Meantime the wife--but she abjured the name--
8762,_RESENTMENT._,"Endured her lot, and struggled with the shame:"
8763,_RESENTMENT._,"When, lo! an uncle on the mother’s side,"
8764,_RESENTMENT._,"In nature something, as in blood allied,"
8765,_RESENTMENT._,"Admired her firmness, his protection gave,"
8766,_RESENTMENT._,And show’d a kindness she disdain’d to crave.
8767,_RESENTMENT._,"Frugal and rich the man, and frugal grew"
8768,_RESENTMENT._,"The sister-mind, without a selfish view;"
8769,_RESENTMENT._,And further still--the temp’rate pair agreed
8770,_RESENTMENT._,With what they saved the patient poor to feed.           230
8771,_RESENTMENT._,"His whole estate, when to the grave consign’d,"
8772,_RESENTMENT._,Left the good kinsman to the kindred mind;
8773,_RESENTMENT._,"Assured that law, with spell secure and tight,"
8774,_RESENTMENT._,Had fix’d it as her own peculiar right.
8775,_RESENTMENT._,"Now to her ancient residence removed,"
8776,_RESENTMENT._,"She lived as widow, well endow’d and loved;"
8777,_RESENTMENT._,"Decent her table was, and to her door"
8778,_RESENTMENT._,Came daily welcomed the neglected poor.
8779,_RESENTMENT._,"The absent sick were soothed by her relief,"
8780,_RESENTMENT._,As her free bounty sought the haunts of grief;           240
8781,_RESENTMENT._,"A plain and homely charity had she,"
8782,_RESENTMENT._,And loved the objects of her alms to see;
8783,_RESENTMENT._,"With her own hands she dress’d the savoury meat,"
8784,_RESENTMENT._,With her own fingers wrote the choice receipt;
8785,_RESENTMENT._,"She heard all tales that injured wives relate,"
8786,_RESENTMENT._,And took a double interest in their fate;
8787,_RESENTMENT._,But of all husbands not a wretch was known
8788,_RESENTMENT._,"So vile, so mean, so cruel, as her own."
8789,_RESENTMENT._,"This bounteous lady kept an active spy,"
8790,_RESENTMENT._,"To search th’ abodes of want, and to supply;             250"
8791,_RESENTMENT._,The gentle Susan served the liberal dame--
8792,_RESENTMENT._,"Unlike their notions, yet their deeds the same:"
8793,_RESENTMENT._,"No practised villain could a victim find,"
8794,_RESENTMENT._,Than this stern lady more completely blind;
8795,_RESENTMENT._,Nor (if detected in his fraud) could meet
8796,_RESENTMENT._,One less disposed to pardon a deceit;
8797,_RESENTMENT._,"The wrong she treasured, and on no pretence"
8798,_RESENTMENT._,"Received th’ offender, or forgot th’ offence;"
8799,_RESENTMENT._,"But the kind servant, to the thrice-proved knave"
8800,_RESENTMENT._,"A fourth time listen’d, and the past forgave.            260"
8801,_RESENTMENT._,"First in her youth, when she was blithe and gay,"
8802,_RESENTMENT._,"Came a smooth rogue, and stole her love away;"
8803,_RESENTMENT._,"Then to another and another flew,"
8804,_RESENTMENT._,To boast the wanton mischief he could do.
8805,_RESENTMENT._,"Yet she forgave him, though so great her pain,"
8806,_RESENTMENT._,That she was never blithe or gay again.
8807,_RESENTMENT._,"Then came a spoiler, who, with villain-art,"
8808,_RESENTMENT._,"Implored her hand, and agonized her heart;"
8809,_RESENTMENT._,"He seized her purse, in idle waste to spend"
8810,_RESENTMENT._,"With a vile wanton, whom she call’d her friend;          270"
8811,_RESENTMENT._,Five years she suffer’d--he had revell’d five--
8812,_RESENTMENT._,Then came to show her he was just alive;
8813,_RESENTMENT._,"Alone he came, his vile companion dead,"
8814,_RESENTMENT._,"And he, a wand’ring pauper, wanting bread;"
8815,_RESENTMENT._,"His body wasted, wither’d life and limb,"
8816,_RESENTMENT._,When this kind soul became a slave to him.
8817,_RESENTMENT._,"Nay, she was sure that, should he now survive,"
8818,_RESENTMENT._,No better husband would be left alive;
8819,_RESENTMENT._,"For him she mourn’d, and then, alone and poor,"
8820,_RESENTMENT._,Sought and found comfort at her lady’s door:             280
8821,_RESENTMENT._,"Ten years she served, and, mercy her employ,"
8822,_RESENTMENT._,"Her tasks were pleasure, and her duty joy."
8823,_RESENTMENT._,"Thus lived the mistress and the maid, design’d"
8824,_RESENTMENT._,"Each other’s aid--one cautious, and both kind."
8825,_RESENTMENT._,"Oft at their window, working, they would sigh"
8826,_RESENTMENT._,To see the aged and the sick go by;
8827,_RESENTMENT._,"Like wounded bees, that at their home arrive,"
8828,_RESENTMENT._,"Slowly and weak, but labouring for the hive."
8829,_RESENTMENT._,The busy people of a mason’s yard
8830,_RESENTMENT._,The curious lady view’d with much regard;                290
8831,_RESENTMENT._,With steady motion she perceived them draw
8832,_RESENTMENT._,Through blocks of stone the slowly-working saw;
8833,_RESENTMENT._,It gave her pleasure and surprise to see
8834,_RESENTMENT._,Among these men the signs of revelry;
8835,_RESENTMENT._,"Cold was the season, and confined their view,"
8836,_RESENTMENT._,"Tedious their tasks, but merry were the crew."
8837,_RESENTMENT._,"There she beheld an aged pauper wait,"
8838,_RESENTMENT._,"Patient and still, to take an humble freight;"
8839,_RESENTMENT._,Within the panniers on an ass he laid
8840,_RESENTMENT._,"The ponderous grit, and for the portion paid;            300"
8841,_RESENTMENT._,"This he re-sold, and, with each trifling gift,"
8842,_RESENTMENT._,"Made shift to live, and wretched was the shift."
8843,_RESENTMENT._,Now will it be by every reader told
8844,_RESENTMENT._,"Who was this humble trader, poor and old.--"
8845,_RESENTMENT._,"In vain an author would a name suppress,"
8846,_RESENTMENT._,From the least hint a reader learns to guess;
8847,_RESENTMENT._,Of children lost our novels sometimes treat;
8848,_RESENTMENT._,We never care--assured again to meet.
8849,_RESENTMENT._,"In vain the writer for concealment tries,"
8850,_RESENTMENT._,We trace his purpose under all disguise;                 310
8851,_RESENTMENT._,"Nay, though he tells us they are dead and gone,"
8852,_RESENTMENT._,Of whom we wot--they will appear anon;
8853,_RESENTMENT._,"Our favourites fight, are wounded, hopeless lie;"
8854,_RESENTMENT._,"Survive they cannot--nay, they cannot die:"
8855,_RESENTMENT._,"Now, as these tricks and stratagems are known,"
8856,_RESENTMENT._,"’Tis best, at once, the simple truth to own."
8857,_RESENTMENT._,This was the husband--in an humble shed
8858,_RESENTMENT._,"He nightly slept, and daily sought his bread."
8859,_RESENTMENT._,Once for relief the weary man applied;
8860,_RESENTMENT._,"“Your wife is rich,” the angry vestry cried;             320"
8861,_RESENTMENT._,"Alas! he dared not to his wife complain,"
8862,_RESENTMENT._,"Feeling her wrongs, and fearing her disdain:"
8863,_RESENTMENT._,"By various methods he had tried to live,"
8864,_RESENTMENT._,But not one effort would subsistence give.
8865,_RESENTMENT._,"He was an usher in a school, till noise"
8866,_RESENTMENT._,Made him less able than the weaker boys;
8867,_RESENTMENT._,"On messages he went, till he in vain"
8868,_RESENTMENT._,"Strove names, or words, or meanings to retain;"
8869,_RESENTMENT._,Each small employment in each neighbouring town
8870,_RESENTMENT._,"By turn he took, to lay as quickly down;                 330"
8871,_RESENTMENT._,"For, such his fate, he fail’d in all he plann’d,"
8872,_RESENTMENT._,And nothing prosper’d in his luckless hand.
8873,_RESENTMENT._,"At his old home, his motive half suppress’d,"
8874,_RESENTMENT._,"He sought no more for riches, but for rest:"
8875,_RESENTMENT._,"There lived the bounteous wife, and at her gate"
8876,_RESENTMENT._,He saw in cheerful groups the needy wait;
8877,_RESENTMENT._,“Had he a right with bolder hope t’ apply?”
8878,_RESENTMENT._,"He ask’d--was answer’d, and went groaning by;"
8879,_RESENTMENT._,"For some remains of spirit, temper, pride,"
8880,_RESENTMENT._,Forbade a prayer he knew would be denied.                340
8881,_RESENTMENT._,"Thus was the grieving man, with burthen’d ass,"
8882,_RESENTMENT._,Seen day by day along the street to pass:
8883,_RESENTMENT._,"“Who is he, Susan? who the poor old man?"
8884,_RESENTMENT._,"He never calls--do make him, if you can.”--"
8885,_RESENTMENT._,"The conscious damsel still delay’d to speak,"
8886,_RESENTMENT._,"She stopp’d confused, and had her words to seek;"
8887,_RESENTMENT._,"From Susan’s fears the fact her mistress knew,"
8888,_RESENTMENT._,And cried--“The wretch! what scheme has he in view?
8889,_RESENTMENT._,"Is this his lot?--but let him, let him feel--"
8890,_RESENTMENT._,"Who wants the courage, not the will to steal.”           350"
8891,_RESENTMENT._,"A dreadful winter came, each day severe,"
8892,_RESENTMENT._,"Misty when mild, and icy cold when clear;"
8893,_RESENTMENT._,"And still the humble dealer took his load,"
8894,_RESENTMENT._,"Returning slow, and shivering on the road:"
8895,_RESENTMENT._,"The lady, still relentless, saw him come,"
8896,_RESENTMENT._,"And said--“I wonder, has the wretch a home?”--"
8897,_RESENTMENT._,“A hut! a hovel!”--“Then his fate appears
8898,_RESENTMENT._,"To suit his crime;”--“Yes, lady, not his years--"
8899,_RESENTMENT._,No! nor his sufferings--nor that form decay’d.”--
8900,_RESENTMENT._,“Well! let the parish give its paupers aid;              360
8901,_RESENTMENT._,You must the vileness of his acts allow.”--
8902,_RESENTMENT._,"“And you, dear lady, that he feels it now.”--"
8903,_RESENTMENT._,"“When such dissemblers on their deeds reflect,"
8904,_RESENTMENT._,Can they the pity they refused expect?
8905,_RESENTMENT._,"He that doth evil, evil shall he dread.”--             }"
8906,_RESENTMENT._,"“The snow,” quoth Susan, “falls upon his bed--         }"
8907,_RESENTMENT._,It blows beside the thatch--it melts upon his head.”-- }
8908,_RESENTMENT._,"“’Tis weakness, child, for grieving guilt to feel.”--"
8909,_RESENTMENT._,"“Yes, but he never sees a wholesome meal;"
8910,_RESENTMENT._,"Through his bare dress appears his shrivell’d skin,      370"
8911,_RESENTMENT._,"And ill he fares without, and worse within;"
8912,_RESENTMENT._,"With that weak body, lame, diseased, and slow,"
8913,_RESENTMENT._,"What cold, pain, peril, must the sufferer know!”--"
8914,_RESENTMENT._,"“Think on his crime.”--“Yes, sure ’twas very wrong;"
8915,_RESENTMENT._,"But look, (God bless him!) how he gropes along.”--"
8916,_RESENTMENT._,"“Brought me to shame.”--“Oh! yes, I know it all--     }"
8917,_RESENTMENT._,What cutting blast! and he can scarcely crawl;        }
8918,_RESENTMENT._,He freezes as he moves--he dies! if he should fall.   }
8919,_RESENTMENT._,With cruel fierceness drives this icy sleet--
8920,_RESENTMENT._,"And must a Christian perish in the street,               380"
8921,_RESENTMENT._,"In sight of Christians?--There! at last, he lies;"
8922,_RESENTMENT._,Nor unsupported can he ever rise:
8923,_RESENTMENT._,He cannot live.”--“But is he fit to die?”--
8924,_RESENTMENT._,"Here Susan softly mutter’d a reply,"
8925,_RESENTMENT._,"Look’d round the room--said something of its state,"
8926,_RESENTMENT._,"Dives the rich, and Lazarus at his gate;"
8927,_RESENTMENT._,"And then, aloud--“In pity do behold"
8928,_RESENTMENT._,"The man affrighten’d, weeping, trembling, cold."
8929,_RESENTMENT._,Oh! how those flakes of snow their entrance win
8930,_RESENTMENT._,"Through the poor rags, and keep the frost within;        390"
8931,_RESENTMENT._,"His very heart seems frozen as he goes,"
8932,_RESENTMENT._,Leading that starved companion of his woes:
8933,_RESENTMENT._,"He tried to pray--his lips, I saw them move,"
8934,_RESENTMENT._,And he so turn’d his piteous looks above;
8935,_RESENTMENT._,"But the fierce wind the willing heart opposed,"
8936,_RESENTMENT._,"And, ere he spoke, the lips in misery closed."
8937,_RESENTMENT._,"Poor suffering object! yes, for ease you pray’d,"
8938,_RESENTMENT._,"And God will hear--he only, I’m afraid.”--"
8939,_RESENTMENT._,"“Peace! Susan, peace! Pain ever follows sin.”--"
8940,_RESENTMENT._,"“Ah! then,” thought Susan, “when will ours begin?        400"
8941,_RESENTMENT._,"When reach’d his home, to what a cheerless fire"
8942,_RESENTMENT._,And chilling bed will those cold limbs retire!
8943,_RESENTMENT._,"Yet ragged, wretched as it is, that bed"
8944,_RESENTMENT._,Takes half the space of his contracted shed;
8945,_RESENTMENT._,"I saw the thorns beside the narrow grate,"
8946,_RESENTMENT._,With straw collected in a putrid state.
8947,_RESENTMENT._,"There will he, kneeling, strive the fire to raise,"
8948,_RESENTMENT._,"And that will warm him, rather than the blaze;"
8949,_RESENTMENT._,"The sullen, smoky blaze, that cannot last"
8950,_RESENTMENT._,One moment after his attempt is past:                    410
8951,_RESENTMENT._,"And I so warmly and so purely laid,"
8952,_RESENTMENT._,"To sink to rest--indeed, I am afraid.”--"
8953,_RESENTMENT._,"“Know you his conduct?”--“Yes, indeed, I know--"
8954,_RESENTMENT._,And how he wanders in the wind and snow:
8955,_RESENTMENT._,"Safe in our rooms the threat’ning storm we hear,"
8956,_RESENTMENT._,But he feels strongly what we faintly fear.”--
8957,_RESENTMENT._,"“Wilful was rich, and he the storm defied;"
8958,_RESENTMENT._,"Wilful is poor, and must the storm abide;”"
8959,_RESENTMENT._,Said the stern lady;--“’tis in vain to feel;
8960,_RESENTMENT._,Go and prepare the chicken for our meal.”                420
8961,_RESENTMENT._,"Susan her task reluctantly began,"
8962,_RESENTMENT._,And utter’d as she went--“The poor old man!”--
8963,_RESENTMENT._,But while her soft and ever-yielding heart
8964,_RESENTMENT._,"Made strong protest against her lady’s part,"
8965,_RESENTMENT._,"The lady’s self began to think it wrong,"
8966,_RESENTMENT._,To feel so wrathful and resent so long.
8967,_RESENTMENT._,"“No more the wretch would she receive again,"
8968,_RESENTMENT._,No more behold him--but she would sustain;
8969,_RESENTMENT._,"Great his offence, and evil was his mind--"
8970,_RESENTMENT._,"But he had suffer’d, and she would be kind:              430"
8971,_RESENTMENT._,"She spurn’d such baseness, and she found within"
8972,_RESENTMENT._,A fair acquittal from so foul a sin;
8973,_RESENTMENT._,"Yet she too err’d, and must of Heaven expect"
8974,_RESENTMENT._,"To be rejected, him should she reject.”"
8975,_RESENTMENT._,Susan was summon’d--“I’m about to do
8976,_RESENTMENT._,"A foolish act, in part seduced by you:"
8977,_RESENTMENT._,"Go to the creature--say that I intend,"
8978,_RESENTMENT._,"Foe to his sins, to be his sorrow’s friend;"
8979,_RESENTMENT._,"Take, for his present comforts, food and wine,"
8980,_RESENTMENT._,And mark his feelings at this act of mine;               440
8981,_RESENTMENT._,"Observe if shame be o’er his features spread,"
8982,_RESENTMENT._,By his own victim to be soothed and fed;
8983,_RESENTMENT._,"But, this inform him, that it is not love"
8984,_RESENTMENT._,"That prompts my heart, that duties only move."
8985,_RESENTMENT._,"Say, that no merits in his favour plead,"
8986,_RESENTMENT._,"But miseries only, and his abject need;"
8987,_RESENTMENT._,"Nor bring me grov’ling thanks, nor high-flown praise;"
8988,_RESENTMENT._,"I would his spirits, not his fancy raise."
8989,_RESENTMENT._,Give him no hope that I shall ever more
8990,_RESENTMENT._,A man so vile to my esteem restore;                      450
8991,_RESENTMENT._,"But warn him rather, that, in time of rest,"
8992,_RESENTMENT._,His crimes be all remember’d and confess’d:
8993,_RESENTMENT._,"I know not all that form the sinner’s debt,"
8994,_RESENTMENT._,But there is one that he must not forget.”
8995,_RESENTMENT._,The mind of Susan prompted her with speed
8996,_RESENTMENT._,To act her part in every courteous deed:
8997,_RESENTMENT._,"All that was kind she was prepared to say,"
8998,_RESENTMENT._,And keep the lecture for a future day;
8999,_RESENTMENT._,"When he had all life’s comforts by his side,"
9000,_RESENTMENT._,"Pity might sleep, and good advice be tried.              460"
9001,_RESENTMENT._,"This done, the mistress felt disposed to look,"
9002,_RESENTMENT._,"As self-approving, on a pious book:"
9003,_RESENTMENT._,"Yet, to her native bias still inclined,"
9004,_RESENTMENT._,She felt her act too merciful and kind;
9005,_RESENTMENT._,"But when, long musing on the chilling scene"
9006,_RESENTMENT._,So lately past--the frost and sleet so keen--
9007,_RESENTMENT._,The man’s whole misery in a single view--
9008,_RESENTMENT._,Yes! she could think some pity was his due.
9009,_RESENTMENT._,"Thus fix’d, she heard not her attendant glide"
9010,_RESENTMENT._,"With soft slow step--till, standing by her side,         470"
9011,_RESENTMENT._,"The trembling servant gasp’d for breath, and shed"
9012,_RESENTMENT._,"Relieving tears, then utter’d---“He is dead!”"
9013,_RESENTMENT._,"“Dead!” said the startled lady; “Yes, he fell"
9014,_RESENTMENT._,Close at the door where he was wont to dwell;
9015,_RESENTMENT._,"There his sole friend, the ass, was standing by,"
9016,_RESENTMENT._,"Half-dead himself, to see his master die.”"
9017,_RESENTMENT._,"“Expired he then, good Heaven! for want of food?”--"
9018,_RESENTMENT._,“No! crusts and water in a corner stood;--
9019,_RESENTMENT._,"To have this plenty, and to wait so long,"
9020,_RESENTMENT._,"And to be right too late, is doubly wrong:               480"
9021,_RESENTMENT._,"Then, every day to see him totter by,"
9022,_RESENTMENT._,And to forbear--Oh! what a heart had I!”--
9023,_RESENTMENT._,"“Blame me not, child; I tremble at the news.”--"
9024,_RESENTMENT._,"“’Tis my own heart,” said Susan, “I accuse:"
9025,_RESENTMENT._,To have this money in my purse--to know
9026,_RESENTMENT._,"What grief was his, and what to grief we owe;"
9027,_RESENTMENT._,"To see him often, always to conceive"
9028,_RESENTMENT._,"How he must pine and languish, groan and grieve;"
9029,_RESENTMENT._,And every day in ease and peace to dine
9030,_RESENTMENT._,And rest in comfort!--what a heart is mine!”--          490

9062,_THE WAGER._,"Counter and Clubb were men in trade, whose pains,"
9063,_THE WAGER._,"Credit, and prudence, brought them constant gains;"
9064,_THE WAGER._,"Partners and punctual, every friend agreed"
9065,_THE WAGER._,Counter and Clubb were men who must succeed.
9066,_THE WAGER._,"When they had fix’d some little time in life,"
9067,_THE WAGER._,Each thought of taking to himself a wife;
9068,_THE WAGER._,"As men in trade alike, as men in love"
9069,_THE WAGER._,They seem’d with no according views to move;
9070,_THE WAGER._,"As certain ores in outward view the same,"
9071,_THE WAGER._,They show’d their difference when the magnet came.        10
9072,_THE WAGER._,"Counter was vain; with spirit strong and high,"
9073,_THE WAGER._,’Twas not in him like suppliant swain to sigh:
9074,_THE WAGER._,"“His wife might o’er his men and maids preside,"
9075,_THE WAGER._,And in her province be a judge and guide;
9076,_THE WAGER._,"But what he thought, or did, or wish’d to do,"
9077,_THE WAGER._,"She must not know, or censure if she knew;"
9078,_THE WAGER._,"At home, abroad, by day, by night, if he"
9079,_THE WAGER._,"On aught determined, so it was to be."
9080,_THE WAGER._,"How is a man,” he ask’d, “for business fit,"
9081,_THE WAGER._,Who to a female can his will submit?                      20
9082,_THE WAGER._,"Absent awhile, let no inquiring eye"
9083,_THE WAGER._,"Or plainer speech presume to question why,"
9084,_THE WAGER._,"But all be silent; and, when seen again,"
9085,_THE WAGER._,Let all be cheerful--shall a wife complain?
9086,_THE WAGER._,"Friends I invite, and who shall dare t’ object,"
9087,_THE WAGER._,Or look on them with coolness or neglect?
9088,_THE WAGER._,"No! I must ever of my house be head,"
9089,_THE WAGER._,"And, thus obey’d, I condescend to wed.”"
9090,_THE WAGER._,"Clubb heard the speech--“My friend is nice,” said he;"
9091,_THE WAGER._,“A wife with less respect will do for me.                 30
9092,_THE WAGER._,How is he certain such a prize to gain?         }
9093,_THE WAGER._,"What he approves, a lass may learn to feign,    }"
9094,_THE WAGER._,And so affect t’ obey till she begins to reign; }
9095,_THE WAGER._,"Awhile complying, she may vary then,"
9096,_THE WAGER._,And be as wives of more unwary men;
9097,_THE WAGER._,"Beside, to him who plays such lordly part,"
9098,_THE WAGER._,How shall a tender creature yield her heart?
9099,_THE WAGER._,"Should he the promised confidence refuse,"
9100,_THE WAGER._,She may another more confiding choose;
9101,_THE WAGER._,"May show her anger, yet her purpose hide,                 40"
9102,_THE WAGER._,"And wake his jealousy, and wound his pride."
9103,_THE WAGER._,"In one so humbled, who can trace the friend?"
9104,_THE WAGER._,"I on an equal, not a slave, depend;"
9105,_THE WAGER._,"If true, my confidence is wisely placed,"
9106,_THE WAGER._,"And, being false, she only is disgraced.”"
9107,_THE WAGER._,"Clubb, with these notions, cast his eye around,"
9108,_THE WAGER._,And one so easy soon a partner found.
9109,_THE WAGER._,The lady chosen was of good repute;
9110,_THE WAGER._,"Meekness she had not, and was seldom mute;"
9111,_THE WAGER._,"Though quick to anger, still she loved to smile;          50"
9112,_THE WAGER._,And would be calm if men would wait awhile:
9113,_THE WAGER._,"She knew her duty, and she loved her way,"
9114,_THE WAGER._,More pleased in truth to govern than obey;
9115,_THE WAGER._,"She heard her priest with reverence, and her spouse"
9116,_THE WAGER._,As one who felt the pressure of her vows.
9117,_THE WAGER._,"Useful and civil, all her friends confess’d--"
9118,_THE WAGER._,"Give her her way, and she would choose the best;"
9119,_THE WAGER._,Though some indeed a sly remark would make--
9120,_THE WAGER._,"Give it her not, and she would choose to take."
9121,_THE WAGER._,"All this, when Clubb some cheerful months had spent,    60"
9122,_THE WAGER._,"He saw, confess’d, and said he was content."
9123,_THE WAGER._,"Counter meantime selected, doubted, weigh’d,"
9124,_THE WAGER._,And then brought home a young complying maid--
9125,_THE WAGER._,"A tender creature, full of fears as charms,"
9126,_THE WAGER._,A beauteous nursling from its mother’s arms;
9127,_THE WAGER._,"A soft, sweet blossom, such as men must love,"
9128,_THE WAGER._,But to preserve must keep it in the stove.
9129,_THE WAGER._,"She had a mild, subdued, expiring look--"
9130,_THE WAGER._,"Raise but the voice, and this fair creature shook;"
9131,_THE WAGER._,"Leave her alone, she felt a thousand fears--             70"
9132,_THE WAGER._,"Chide, and she melted into floods of tears;"
9133,_THE WAGER._,"Fondly she pleaded and would gently sigh,"
9134,_THE WAGER._,"For very pity, or she knew not why;"
9135,_THE WAGER._,One whom to govern none could be afraid--
9136,_THE WAGER._,"Hold up the finger, this meek thing obey’d;"
9137,_THE WAGER._,Her happy husband had the easiest task--
9138,_THE WAGER._,"Say but his will, no question would she ask;"
9139,_THE WAGER._,"She sought no reasons, no affairs she knew,"
9140,_THE WAGER._,"Of business spoke not, and had nought to do."
9141,_THE WAGER._,"Oft he exclaim’d, “How meek! how mild! how kind!        80"
9142,_THE WAGER._,With her ’twere cruel but to seem unkind;
9143,_THE WAGER._,"Though ever silent when I take my leave,"
9144,_THE WAGER._,It pains my heart to think how hers will grieve;
9145,_THE WAGER._,"’Tis heaven on earth with such a wife to dwell,"
9146,_THE WAGER._,I am in raptures to have sped so well;
9147,_THE WAGER._,"But let me not, my friend, your envy raise,"
9148,_THE WAGER._,"No! on my life, your patience has my praise.”"
9149,_THE WAGER._,"His friend, though silent, felt the scorn implied--"
9150,_THE WAGER._,“What need of patience?” to himself he cried:
9151,_THE WAGER._,"“Better a woman o’er her house to rule,                   90"
9152,_THE WAGER._,Than a poor child just hurried from her school:
9153,_THE WAGER._,"Who has no care, yet never lives at ease;"
9154,_THE WAGER._,"Unfit to rule, and indisposed to please;"
9155,_THE WAGER._,"What if he govern, there his boast should end,"
9156,_THE WAGER._,No husband’s power can make a slave his friend.”
9157,_THE WAGER._,It was the custom of these friends to meet
9158,_THE WAGER._,With a few neighbours in a neighbouring street;
9159,_THE WAGER._,"Where Counter oft-times would occasion seize,"
9160,_THE WAGER._,To move his silent friend by words like these:
9161,_THE WAGER._,"“A man,” said he, “if govern’d by his wife,              100"
9162,_THE WAGER._,Gives up his rank and dignity in life;
9163,_THE WAGER._,Now better fate befalls my friend and me.”--
9164,_THE WAGER._,"He spoke, and look’d th’ approving smile to see."
9165,_THE WAGER._,"The quiet partner, when he chose to speak,"
9166,_THE WAGER._,"Desired his friend, “another theme to seek;"
9167,_THE WAGER._,"When thus they met, he judged that state-affairs"
9168,_THE WAGER._,And such important subjects should be theirs.”
9169,_THE WAGER._,"But still the partner, in his lighter vein,"
9170,_THE WAGER._,Would cause in Clubb affliction or disdain;
9171,_THE WAGER._,It made him anxious to detect the cause                  110
9172,_THE WAGER._,Of all that boasting--“Wants my friend applause?
9173,_THE WAGER._,"This plainly proves him not at perfect ease,"
9174,_THE WAGER._,"For, felt he pleasure, he would wish to please.--"
9175,_THE WAGER._,These triumphs here for some regrets atone--
9176,_THE WAGER._,Men who are blest let other men alone.”
9177,_THE WAGER._,"Thus made suspicious, he observed and saw"
9178,_THE WAGER._,His friend each night at early hour withdraw;
9179,_THE WAGER._,"He sometimes mention’d Juliet’s tender nerves,"
9180,_THE WAGER._,And what attention such a wife deserves.
9181,_THE WAGER._,"“In this,” thought Clubb, “full sure some mystery lies--}"
9182,_THE WAGER._,"He laughs at me, yet he with much complies,             } 121"
9183,_THE WAGER._,And all his vaunts of bliss are proud apologies.”       }
9184,_THE WAGER._,"With such ideas treasured in his breast,"
9185,_THE WAGER._,"He grew composed, and let his anger rest;"
9186,_THE WAGER._,Till Counter once (when wine so long went round
9187,_THE WAGER._,That friendship and discretion both were drown’d)
9188,_THE WAGER._,Began in teasing and triumphant mood
9189,_THE WAGER._,"His evening banter--“Of all earthly good,"
9190,_THE WAGER._,"The best,” he said, “was an obedient spouse,"
9191,_THE WAGER._,Such as my friend’s--that every one allows:              130
9192,_THE WAGER._,What if she wishes his designs to know?
9193,_THE WAGER._,It is because she would her praise bestow;
9194,_THE WAGER._,What if she wills that he remains at home?
9195,_THE WAGER._,She knows that mischief may from travel come.
9196,_THE WAGER._,"I, who am free to venture where I please,"
9197,_THE WAGER._,Have no such kind preventing checks as these;
9198,_THE WAGER._,"But mine is double duty, first to guide"
9199,_THE WAGER._,"Myself aright, then rule a house beside;"
9200,_THE WAGER._,"While this our friend, more happy than the free,"
9201,_THE WAGER._,"Resigns all power, and laughs at liberty.”               140"
9202,_THE WAGER._,"“By Heaven,” said Clubb, “excuse me if I swear,"
9203,_THE WAGER._,"I’ll bet a hundred guineas, if he dare,"
9204,_THE WAGER._,"That uncontroll’d I will such freedoms take,"
9205,_THE WAGER._,That he will fear to equal--there’s my stake.”
9206,_THE WAGER._,"“A match!” said Counter, much by wine inflamed;"
9207,_THE WAGER._,“But we are friends--let smaller stake be named:
9208,_THE WAGER._,"Wine for our future meeting, that will I"
9209,_THE WAGER._,Take and no more--what peril shall we try?”
9210,_THE WAGER._,"“Let’s to Newmarket,” Clubb replied; “or choose"
9211,_THE WAGER._,"Yourself the place, and what you like to lose;           150"
9212,_THE WAGER._,"And he who first returns, or fears to go,"
9213,_THE WAGER._,"Forfeits his cash.”--Said Counter, “Be it so.”"
9214,_THE WAGER._,The friends around them saw with much delight
9215,_THE WAGER._,"The social war, and hail’d the pleasant night;"
9216,_THE WAGER._,"Nor would they further hear the cause discuss’d,"
9217,_THE WAGER._,Afraid the recreant heart of Clubb to trust.
9218,_THE WAGER._,"Now sober thoughts return’d as each withdrew,"
9219,_THE WAGER._,And of the subject took a serious view.
9220,_THE WAGER._,"“’Twas wrong,” thought Counter, “and will grieve my love;”"
9221,_THE WAGER._,"“’Twas wrong,” thought Clubb, “my wife will not approve;"
9222,_THE WAGER._,"But friends were present; I must try the thing,          161"
9223,_THE WAGER._,Or with my folly half the town will ring.”
9224,_THE WAGER._,"He sought his lady--“Madam, I’m to blame,"
9225,_THE WAGER._,"But was reproach’d, and could not bear the shame;"
9226,_THE WAGER._,Here in my folly--for ’tis best to say
9227,_THE WAGER._,The very truth--I’ve sworn to have my way:
9228,_THE WAGER._,"To that Newmarket--(though I hate the place,"
9229,_THE WAGER._,"And have no taste or talents for a race,"
9230,_THE WAGER._,"Yet so it is--well, now prepare to chide--)"
9231,_THE WAGER._,I laid a wager that I dared to ride;                     170
9232,_THE WAGER._,"And I must go: by Heaven, if you resist"
9233,_THE WAGER._,"I shall be scorn’d, and ridiculed, and hiss’d;"
9234,_THE WAGER._,"Let me with grace before my friends appear,"
9235,_THE WAGER._,"You know the truth, and must not be severe;"
9236,_THE WAGER._,"He too must go, but that he will of course;"
9237,_THE WAGER._,Do you consent?--I never think of force.”
9238,_THE WAGER._,"“You never need,” the worthy dame replied;"
9239,_THE WAGER._,“The husband’s honour is the woman’s pride;
9240,_THE WAGER._,"If I in trifles be the wilful wife,"
9241,_THE WAGER._,Still for your credit I would lose my life;              180
9242,_THE WAGER._,"Go! and when fix’d the day of your return,"
9243,_THE WAGER._,"Stay longer yet, and let the blockheads learn,"
9244,_THE WAGER._,"That, though a wife may sometimes wish to rule,"
9245,_THE WAGER._,She would not make th’ indulgent man a fool;
9246,_THE WAGER._,I would at times advise--but idle they
9247,_THE WAGER._,Who think th’ assenting husband _must_ obey.”
9248,_THE WAGER._,"The happy man, who thought his lady right"
9249,_THE WAGER._,"In other cases, was assured to-night;"
9250,_THE WAGER._,"Then for the day with proud delight prepared,"
9251,_THE WAGER._,To show his doubting friends how much he dared.          190
9252,_THE WAGER._,"Counter--who grieving sought his bed, his rest"
9253,_THE WAGER._,Broken by pictures of his love distress’d--
9254,_THE WAGER._,With soft and winning speech the fair prepared:
9255,_THE WAGER._,"“She all his councils, comforts, pleasures shared;"
9256,_THE WAGER._,She was assured he loved her from his soul;
9257,_THE WAGER._,She never knew and need not fear control;
9258,_THE WAGER._,"But so it happen’d--he was grieved at heart,"
9259,_THE WAGER._,"It happen’d so, that they awhile must part--"
9260,_THE WAGER._,"A little time--the distance was but short,"
9261,_THE WAGER._,And business call’d him--he despised the sport;          200
9262,_THE WAGER._,"But to Newmarket he engaged to ride,"
9263,_THE WAGER._,With his friend Clubb;” and there he stopp’d and sigh’d.
9264,_THE WAGER._,"Awhile the tender creature look’d dismay’d,"
9265,_THE WAGER._,Then floods of tears the call of grief obey’d:--
9266,_THE WAGER._,"“She an objection! No!” she sobb’d, “not one;"
9267,_THE WAGER._,"Her work was finish’d, and her race was run;"
9268,_THE WAGER._,"For die she must, indeed she would not live"
9269,_THE WAGER._,"A week alone, for all the world could give;"
9270,_THE WAGER._,He too must die in that same wicked place;
9271,_THE WAGER._,It always happen’d--was a common case;                   210
9272,_THE WAGER._,"Among those horrid horses, jockeys, crowds,"
9273,_THE WAGER._,’Twas certain death--they might bespeak their shrouds;
9274,_THE WAGER._,"He would attempt a race, be sure to fall--"
9275,_THE WAGER._,And she expire with terror--that was all;
9276,_THE WAGER._,With love like hers she was indeed unfit
9277,_THE WAGER._,"To bear such horrors, but she must submit.”--"
9278,_THE WAGER._,"“But for three days, my love! three days at most--”"
9279,_THE WAGER._,“Enough for me; I then shall be a ghost.--”
9280,_THE WAGER._,"“My honour’s pledged!”--“Oh! yes, my dearest life,"
9281,_THE WAGER._,I know your honour must outweigh your wife;              220
9282,_THE WAGER._,"But ere this absence, have you sought a friend--"
9283,_THE WAGER._,I shall be dead--on whom can you depend?--
9284,_THE WAGER._,Let me one favour of your kindness crave:
9285,_THE WAGER._,Grant me the stone I mention’d for my grave.--”
9286,_THE WAGER._,"“Nay, love, attend--why, bless my soul--I say"
9287,_THE WAGER._,I will return--there--weep no longer--nay!”--
9288,_THE WAGER._,"“Well! I obey, and to the last am true,"
9289,_THE WAGER._,But spirits fail me; I must die; adieu!”
9290,_THE WAGER._,"“What, madam! must?--’tis wrong--I’m angry--zounds!"
9291,_THE WAGER._,Can I remain and lose a thousand pounds?”                230
9292,_THE WAGER._,"“Go then, my love! it is a monstrous sum,"
9293,_THE WAGER._,"Worth twenty wives--go, love! and I am dumb--"
9294,_THE WAGER._,"Nor be displeased--[had] I the power to live,"
9295,_THE WAGER._,"You might be angry, now you must forgive;"
9296,_THE WAGER._,Alas! I faint--ah! cruel--there’s no need
9297,_THE WAGER._,Of wounds or fevers--this had done the deed.”
9298,_THE WAGER._,"The lady fainted, and the husband sent"
9299,_THE WAGER._,"For every aid, for every comfort went;"
9300,_THE WAGER._,"Strong terror seized him; “Oh! she loved so well,"
9301,_THE WAGER._,And who th’ effect of tenderness could tell?”            240
9302,_THE WAGER._,"She now recover’d, and again began"
9303,_THE WAGER._,With accent querulous--“Ah! cruel man--”
9304,_THE WAGER._,"Till the sad husband, conscience-struck, confess’d,"
9305,_THE WAGER._,’Twas very wicked with his friend to jest;
9306,_THE WAGER._,"For now he saw that those who were obey’d,"
9307,_THE WAGER._,Could like the most subservient feel afraid;
9308,_THE WAGER._,"And, though a wife might not dispute the will"
9309,_THE WAGER._,"Of her liege lord, she could prevent it still."
9310,_THE WAGER._,"The morning came, and Clubb prepared to ride"
9311,_THE WAGER._,"With a smart boy, his servant and his guide;             250"
9312,_THE WAGER._,"When, ere he mounted on the ready steed,"
9313,_THE WAGER._,"Arrived a letter, and he stopp’d to read."
9314,_THE WAGER._,"“My friend,” he read--“our journey I decline:"
9315,_THE WAGER._,A heart too tender for such strife is mine;
9316,_THE WAGER._,"Yours is the triumph, be you so inclined;"
9317,_THE WAGER._,"But you are too considerate and kind,"
9318,_THE WAGER._,In tender pity to my Juliet’s fears
9319,_THE WAGER._,"I thus relent, o’ercome by love and tears;"
9320,_THE WAGER._,"She knows your kindness; I have heard her say,"
9321,_THE WAGER._,A man like you ’tis pleasure to obey.                    260
9322,_THE WAGER._,"Each faithful wife, like ours, must disapprove"
9323,_THE WAGER._,Such dangerous trifling with connubial love;
9324,_THE WAGER._,"What has the idle world, my friend, to do"
9325,_THE WAGER._,With our affairs? they envy me and you.
9326,_THE WAGER._,What if I could my gentle spouse command--
9327,_THE WAGER._,Is that a cause I should her tears withstand?
9328,_THE WAGER._,"And what if you, a friend of peace, submit"
9329,_THE WAGER._,To one you love--is that a theme for wit?
9330,_THE WAGER._,’Twas wrong; and I shall henceforth judge it weak
9331,_THE WAGER._,Both of submission and control to speak.                 270
9332,_THE WAGER._,"Be it agreed that all contention cease,"
9333,_THE WAGER._,And no such follies vex our future peace;
9334,_THE WAGER._,"Let each keep guard against domestic strife,"
9335,_THE WAGER._,And find nor slave nor tyrant in his wife.”
9336,_THE WAGER._,"“Agreed,” said Clubb, “with all my soul agreed”--"
9337,_THE WAGER._,"And to the boy, delighted, gave his steed;"
9338,_THE WAGER._,"“I think my friend has well his mind express’d,"
9339,_THE WAGER._,And I assent; such things are not a jest.”
9340,_THE WAGER._,"“True,” said the wife, “no longer he can hide"
9341,_THE WAGER._,The truth that pains him by his wounded pride.           280
9342,_THE WAGER._,"Your friend has found it not an easy thing,"
9343,_THE WAGER._,Beneath his yoke this yielding soul to bring;
9344,_THE WAGER._,"These weeping willows, though they seem inclined        }"
9345,_THE WAGER._,"By every breeze, yet not the strongest wind             }"
9346,_THE WAGER._,Can from their bent divert this weak but stubborn kind; }
9347,_THE WAGER._,"Drooping they seek your pity to excite,"
9348,_THE WAGER._,But ’tis at once their nature and delight.
9349,_THE WAGER._,"Such women feel not; while they sigh and weep,"
9350,_THE WAGER._,’Tis but their habit--their affections sleep;
9351,_THE WAGER._,"They are like ice that in the hand we hold,              290"
9352,_THE WAGER._,"So very melting, yet so very cold;"
9353,_THE WAGER._,On such affection let not man rely:
9354,_THE WAGER._,"The husbands suffer, and the ladies sigh."
9355,_THE WAGER._,"But your friend’s offer let us kindly take,"
9356,_THE WAGER._,And spare his pride for his vexation’s sake;
9357,_THE WAGER._,"For he has found, and through his life will find,           }"
9358,_THE WAGER._,’Tis easiest dealing with the firmest mind--                }

9398,_THE CONVERT._,Some to our hero have a hero’s name
9399,_THE CONVERT._,"Denied, because no father’s he could claim;"
9400,_THE CONVERT._,Nor could his mother with precision state
9401,_THE CONVERT._,A full fair claim to her certificate;
9402,_THE CONVERT._,On her own word the marriage must depend--
9403,_THE CONVERT._,A point she was not eager to defend.
9404,_THE CONVERT._,"But who, without a father’s name, can raise"
9405,_THE CONVERT._,"His own so high, deserves the greater praise:"
9406,_THE CONVERT._,"The less advantage to the strife he brought,"
9407,_THE CONVERT._,The greater wonders has his prowess wrought;              10
9408,_THE CONVERT._,"He who depends upon his wind and limbs,"
9409,_THE CONVERT._,Needs neither cork or bladder when he swims;
9410,_THE CONVERT._,"Nor will by empty breath be puff’d along,"
9411,_THE CONVERT._,As not himself--but in his helpers--strong.
9412,_THE CONVERT._,"Suffice it then, our hero’s name was clear,"
9413,_THE CONVERT._,"For, call John Dighton, and he answer’d, “Here!”"
9414,_THE CONVERT._,But who that name in early life assign’d
9415,_THE CONVERT._,"He never found, he never tried to find;"
9416,_THE CONVERT._,"Whether his kindred were to John disgrace,"
9417,_THE CONVERT._,"Or John to them, is a disputed case;                      20"
9418,_THE CONVERT._,His infant-state owed nothing to their care--
9419,_THE CONVERT._,"His mind neglected, and his body bare;"
9420,_THE CONVERT._,"All his success must on himself depend,"
9421,_THE CONVERT._,"He had no money, counsel, guide, or friend;"
9422,_THE CONVERT._,"But, in a market-town, an active boy"
9423,_THE CONVERT._,"Appear’d, and sought in various ways employ;"
9424,_THE CONVERT._,"Who soon, thus cast upon the world, began"
9425,_THE CONVERT._,To show the talents of a thriving man.
9426,_THE CONVERT._,"With spirit high John learn’d the world to brave,"
9427,_THE CONVERT._,And in both senses was a ready knave;                     30
9428,_THE CONVERT._,"Knave [as of] old, obedient, keen, and quick,"
9429,_THE CONVERT._,"Knave as at present, skill’d to shift and trick."
9430,_THE CONVERT._,Some humble part of many trades he caught:
9431,_THE CONVERT._,He for the builder and the painter wrought;
9432,_THE CONVERT._,"For serving-maids on secret errands ran,"
9433,_THE CONVERT._,"The waiter’s helper, and the hostler’s man;"
9434,_THE CONVERT._,"And, when he chanced (oft chanced he) place to lose,"
9435,_THE CONVERT._,His varying genius shone in blacking shoes.
9436,_THE CONVERT._,A midnight fisher by the pond he stood;
9437,_THE CONVERT._,"Assistant poacher, he o’erlook’d the wood;                40"
9438,_THE CONVERT._,At an election John’s impartial mind
9439,_THE CONVERT._,Was to no cause nor candidate confined;
9440,_THE CONVERT._,"To all in turn he full allegiance swore,"
9441,_THE CONVERT._,And in his hat the various badges bore;
9442,_THE CONVERT._,His liberal soul with every sect agreed;
9443,_THE CONVERT._,"Unheard their reasons, he received their creed."
9444,_THE CONVERT._,"At church he deign’d the organ-pipes to fill,"
9445,_THE CONVERT._,And at the meeting sang both loud and shrill;
9446,_THE CONVERT._,"But the full purse these different merits gain’d,"
9447,_THE CONVERT._,By strong demands his lively passions drain’d;            50
9448,_THE CONVERT._,"Liquors he loved of each inflaming kind,"
9449,_THE CONVERT._,To midnight revels flew with ardent mind;
9450,_THE CONVERT._,"Too warm at cards, a losing game he play’d;"
9451,_THE CONVERT._,To fleecing beauty his attention paid;
9452,_THE CONVERT._,"His boiling passions were by oaths express’d,"
9453,_THE CONVERT._,And lies he made his profit and his jest.
9454,_THE CONVERT._,"Such was the boy, and such the man had been,"
9455,_THE CONVERT._,But fate or happier fortune changed the scene;
9456,_THE CONVERT._,A fever seized him; “he should surely die--”
9457,_THE CONVERT._,"He fear’d, and lo! a friend was praying by.               60"
9458,_THE CONVERT._,"With terror moved, this teacher he address’d,"
9459,_THE CONVERT._,And all the errors of his youth confess’d:
9460,_THE CONVERT._,The good man kindly clear’d the sinner’s way
9461,_THE CONVERT._,"To lively hope, and counsell’d him to pray:"
9462,_THE CONVERT._,"Who then resolved, should he from sickness rise,"
9463,_THE CONVERT._,"To quit cards, liquors, poaching, oaths, and lies."
9464,_THE CONVERT._,"His health restored, he yet resolved, and grew"
9465,_THE CONVERT._,"True to his masters, to their meeting true;"
9466,_THE CONVERT._,His old companions at his sober face                 }
9467,_THE CONVERT._,"Laugh’d loud, while he, attesting it was grace,      }   70"
9468,_THE CONVERT._,With tears besought them all his calling to embrace. }
9469,_THE CONVERT._,"To his new friends such convert gave applause,"

9476,_THE CONVERT._,"Pleased the grave friends, nor less his solemn tone,   }"
9477,_THE CONVERT._,"The lengthen’d face of care, the low and inward groan. } 80"
9478,_THE CONVERT._,"The stern good men exulted, when they saw"
9479,_THE CONVERT._,Those timid looks of penitence and awe;
9480,_THE CONVERT._,"Nor thought that one so passive, humble, meek,"
9481,_THE CONVERT._,Had yet a creed and principles to seek.
9482,_THE CONVERT._,"The faith that reason finds, confirms, avows,"
9483,_THE CONVERT._,"The hopes, the views, the comforts she allows--"
9484,_THE CONVERT._,"These were not his, who by his feelings found,"
9485,_THE CONVERT._,"And by them only, that his faith was sound:"
9486,_THE CONVERT._,"Feelings of terror these, for evil past,"
9487,_THE CONVERT._,"Feelings of hope, to be received at last;                 90"
9488,_THE CONVERT._,"Now weak, now lively, changing with the day,"
9489,_THE CONVERT._,"These were his feelings, and he felt his way."
9490,_THE CONVERT._,"Sprung from such sources, will this faith remain"
9491,_THE CONVERT._,While these supporters can their strength retain?
9492,_THE CONVERT._,"As heaviest weights the deepest rivers pass,"
9493,_THE CONVERT._,While icy chains fast bind the solid mass:
9494,_THE CONVERT._,"So, born of feelings, faith remains secure,"
9495,_THE CONVERT._,Long as their firmness and their strength endure;
9496,_THE CONVERT._,"But, when the waters in their channel glide,"
9497,_THE CONVERT._,A bridge must bear us o’er the threat’ning tide;         100
9498,_THE CONVERT._,"Such bridge is reason, and there faith relies,"
9499,_THE CONVERT._,Whether the varying spirits fall or rise.
9500,_THE CONVERT._,"His patrons, still disposed their aid to lend,"
9501,_THE CONVERT._,Behind a counter placed their humble friend;
9502,_THE CONVERT._,"Where pens and paper were on shelves display’d,"
9503,_THE CONVERT._,And pious pamphlets on the windows laid.
9504,_THE CONVERT._,"By nature active, and from vice restrain’d,"
9505,_THE CONVERT._,Increasing trade his bolder views sustain’d;
9506,_THE CONVERT._,"His friends and teachers, finding so much zeal"
9507,_THE CONVERT._,"In that young convert whom they taught to feel,          110"
9508,_THE CONVERT._,"His trade encouraged, and were pleased to find"
9509,_THE CONVERT._,"A hand so ready, with such humble mind."
9510,_THE CONVERT._,"And now, his health restored, his spirits eased,"
9511,_THE CONVERT._,"He wish’d to marry, if the teachers pleased."
9512,_THE CONVERT._,"They, not unwilling, from the virgin-class"
9513,_THE CONVERT._,Took him a comely and a courteous lass;
9514,_THE CONVERT._,"Simple and civil, loving and beloved,"
9515,_THE CONVERT._,She long a fond and faithful partner proved;
9516,_THE CONVERT._,In every year the elders and the priest
9517,_THE CONVERT._,Were duly summon’d to a christening feast;               120
9518,_THE CONVERT._,"Nor came a babe, but by his growing trade,"
9519,_THE CONVERT._,John had provision for the coming made;
9520,_THE CONVERT._,For friends and strangers all were pleased to deal
9521,_THE CONVERT._,With one whose care was equal to his zeal.
9522,_THE CONVERT._,"In human friendships, it compels a sigh,"
9523,_THE CONVERT._,To think what trifles will dissolve the tie.
9524,_THE CONVERT._,"John, now become a master of his trade,"
9525,_THE CONVERT._,Perceived how much improvement might be made;
9526,_THE CONVERT._,"And, as this prospect open’d to his view,"
9527,_THE CONVERT._,A certain portion of his zeal withdrew;                  130
9528,_THE CONVERT._,His fear abated--“What had he to fear--
9529,_THE CONVERT._,"His profits certain, and his conscience clear?”"
9530,_THE CONVERT._,"Above his door a board was placed by John,"
9531,_THE CONVERT._,"And “Dighton, stationer,” was gilt thereon;"
9532,_THE CONVERT._,"His window next, enlarged to twice the size,"
9533,_THE CONVERT._,Shone with such trinkets as the simple prize;
9534,_THE CONVERT._,While in the shop with pious works were seen
9535,_THE CONVERT._,"The last new play, review, or magazine."
9536,_THE CONVERT._,"In orders punctual, he observed--“The books"
9537,_THE CONVERT._,"He never read, and could he judge their looks?           140"
9538,_THE CONVERT._,"Readers and critics should their merits try,"
9539,_THE CONVERT._,He had no office but to sell and buy;
9540,_THE CONVERT._,"Like other traders, profit was his care;"
9541,_THE CONVERT._,"Of what they print, the authors must beware.”"
9542,_THE CONVERT._,"He held his patrons and his teachers dear,"
9543,_THE CONVERT._,But with his trade--they must not interfere.
9544,_THE CONVERT._,’Twas certain now that John had lost the dread
9545,_THE CONVERT._,And pious thoughts that once such terrors bred;
9546,_THE CONVERT._,"His habits varied, and he more inclined"
9547,_THE CONVERT._,"To the vain world, which he had half resign’d:           150"
9548,_THE CONVERT._,"He had moreover in his brethren seen,"
9549,_THE CONVERT._,"Or he imagined, craft, conceit, and spleen;"
9550,_THE CONVERT._,"“They are but men,” said John, “and shall I then"
9551,_THE CONVERT._,"Fear man’s control, or stand in awe of men?"
9552,_THE CONVERT._,"’Tis their advice (their convert’s rule and law),"
9553,_THE CONVERT._,And good it is--I will not stand in awe.”
9554,_THE CONVERT._,"Moreover Dighton, though he thought of books"
9555,_THE CONVERT._,"As one who chiefly on the title looks,"
9556,_THE CONVERT._,"Yet sometimes ponder’d o’er a page to find,"
9557,_THE CONVERT._,"When vex’d with cares, amusement for his mind;           160"
9558,_THE CONVERT._,And by degrees that mind had treasured much
9559,_THE CONVERT._,From works his teachers were afraid to touch.
9560,_THE CONVERT._,"Satiric novels, poets bold and free,"
9561,_THE CONVERT._,"And what their writers term philosophy,"
9562,_THE CONVERT._,All these were read; and he began to feel
9563,_THE CONVERT._,Some self-approval on his bosom steal.
9564,_THE CONVERT._,"Wisdom creates humility, but he"
9565,_THE CONVERT._,"Who thus collects it, will not humble be."
9566,_THE CONVERT._,No longer John was fill’d with pure delight
9567,_THE CONVERT._,"And humble reverence in a pastor’s sight,                170"
9568,_THE CONVERT._,"Who, like a grateful zealot, listening stood,"
9569,_THE CONVERT._,To hear a man so friendly and so good;
9570,_THE CONVERT._,But felt the dignity of one who made
9571,_THE CONVERT._,Himself important by a thriving trade;
9572,_THE CONVERT._,And growing pride in Dighton’s mind was bred
9573,_THE CONVERT._,By the strange food on which it coarsely fed.
9574,_THE CONVERT._,"Their brother’s fall the grieving brethren heard,"
9575,_THE CONVERT._,The pride indeed to all around appear’d;
9576,_THE CONVERT._,"The world, his friends agreed, had won the soul"
9577,_THE CONVERT._,"From its best hopes, the man from their control.         180"
9578,_THE CONVERT._,"To make him humble, and confine his views"
9579,_THE CONVERT._,"Within their bounds, and books which they peruse,"
9580,_THE CONVERT._,"A deputation from these friends select,"
9581,_THE CONVERT._,Might reason with him to some good effect;
9582,_THE CONVERT._,"Arm’d with authority, and led by love,"
9583,_THE CONVERT._,They might those follies from his mind remove;
9584,_THE CONVERT._,"Deciding thus, and with this kind intent,"
9585,_THE CONVERT._,A chosen body with its speaker went.
9586,_THE CONVERT._,"“John,” said the teacher, “John, with great concern"
9587,_THE CONVERT._,"We see thy frailty, and thy fate discern--              190"
9588,_THE CONVERT._,"Satan with toils thy simple soul beset,"
9589,_THE CONVERT._,"And thou art careless, slumbering in the net;"
9590,_THE CONVERT._,Unmindful art thou of thy early vow;
9591,_THE CONVERT._,Who at the morning-meeting sees thee now?
9592,_THE CONVERT._,Who at the evening? where is brother John?
9593,_THE CONVERT._,"We ask--are answer’d, ‘To the tavern gone.’"
9594,_THE CONVERT._,Thee on the sabbath seldom we behold;
9595,_THE CONVERT._,"Thou canst not sing, thou’rt nursing for a cold:"
9596,_THE CONVERT._,"This from the churchmen thou hast learn’d, for they"
9597,_THE CONVERT._,Have colds and fevers on the sabbath-day;                200
9598,_THE CONVERT._,"When in some snug warm room they sit, and pen"
9599,_THE CONVERT._,"Bills from their ledgers, world-entangled men!"
9600,_THE CONVERT._,“See with what pride thou hast enlarged thy shop;
9601,_THE CONVERT._,To view thy tempting stores the heedless stop;
9602,_THE CONVERT._,"By what strange names dost thou these baubles know,"
9603,_THE CONVERT._,"Which wantons wear, to make a sinful show?"
9604,_THE CONVERT._,Hast thou in view these idle volumes placed
9605,_THE CONVERT._,To be the pander of a vicious taste?
9606,_THE CONVERT._,What’s here? a book of dances!--you advance
9607,_THE CONVERT._,"In goodly knowledge--John, wilt learn to dance?          210"
9608,_THE CONVERT._,"How! ‘Go--’ it says, and ‘to the devil go!"
9609,_THE CONVERT._,And shake thyself!’ I tremble--but ’tis so----
9610,_THE CONVERT._,"Wretch as thou art, what answer canst thou make?"
9611,_THE CONVERT._,"Oh! without question, thou wilt go and shake."
9612,_THE CONVERT._,What’s here? ‘The School for Scandal’--pretty schools!
9613,_THE CONVERT._,"Well, and art thou proficient in the rules?"
9614,_THE CONVERT._,"Art thou a pupil, is it thy design"
9615,_THE CONVERT._,To make our names contemptible as thine?
9616,_THE CONVERT._,"‘Old Nick, a Novel!’ oh! ’tis mighty well--"
9617,_THE CONVERT._,A fool has courage when he laughs at hell;               220
9618,_THE CONVERT._,"‘Frolic and Fun,’ ‘The humours of Tim Grin’;"
9619,_THE CONVERT._,"Why, John, thou grow’st facetious in thy sin;"
9620,_THE CONVERT._,And what? ‘The Archdeacon’s Charge’--‘tis mighty well--
9621,_THE CONVERT._,"If Satan publish’d, thou wouldst doubtless sell;"
9622,_THE CONVERT._,"Jests, novels, dances, and this precious stuff--"
9623,_THE CONVERT._,To crown thy folly we have seen enough;
9624,_THE CONVERT._,We find thee fitted for each evil work---
9625,_THE CONVERT._,"Do print the Koran, and become a Turk!"
9626,_THE CONVERT._,"“John, thou art lost; success and worldly pride }"
9627,_THE CONVERT._,"O’er all thy thoughts and purposes preside,       }     230"
9628,_THE CONVERT._,"Have bound thee fast, and drawn thee far aside;   }"
9629,_THE CONVERT._,"Yet turn, these sin-traps from thy shop expel,"
9630,_THE CONVERT._,"Repent and pray, and all may yet be well."
9631,_THE CONVERT._,"“And here thy wife, thy Dorothy, behold,"
9632,_THE CONVERT._,How fashion’s wanton robes her form infold!
9633,_THE CONVERT._,"Can grace, can goodness with such trappings dwell?"
9634,_THE CONVERT._,"John, thou hast made thy wife a Jezebel."
9635,_THE CONVERT._,"See! on her bosom rests the sign of sin,"
9636,_THE CONVERT._,The glaring proof of naughty thoughts within;
9637,_THE CONVERT._,"What? ’tis a cross; come hither--as a friend,            240"
9638,_THE CONVERT._,Thus from thy neck the shameful badge I rend.”
9639,_THE CONVERT._,"“Rend, if you dare,” said Dighton; “you shall find"
9640,_THE CONVERT._,"A man of spirit, though to peace inclined;"
9641,_THE CONVERT._,Call me ungrateful! have I not my pay
9642,_THE CONVERT._,At all times ready for the expected day?--
9643,_THE CONVERT._,"To share my plenteous board you deign to come,"
9644,_THE CONVERT._,"Myself your pupil, and my house your home;"
9645,_THE CONVERT._,And shall the persons who my meat enjoy
9646,_THE CONVERT._,"Talk of my faults, and treat me as a boy?"
9647,_THE CONVERT._,Have you not told how Rome’s insulting priests           250
9648,_THE CONVERT._,Led their meek laymen like a herd of beasts;
9649,_THE CONVERT._,And by their fleecing and their forgery made
9650,_THE CONVERT._,Their holy calling an accursed trade?
9651,_THE CONVERT._,"Can you such acts and insolence condemn,"
9652,_THE CONVERT._,Who to your utmost power resemble them?
9653,_THE CONVERT._,“Concerns it you what books I set for sale?
9654,_THE CONVERT._,The tale perchance may be a virtuous tale;
9655,_THE CONVERT._,"And, for the rest, ’tis neither wise nor just"
9656,_THE CONVERT._,"In you, who read not, to condemn on trust;"
9657,_THE CONVERT._,Why should th’ Archdeacon’s Charge your spleen excite?
9658,_THE CONVERT._,"He, or perchance th’ archbishop, may be right.           261"
9659,_THE CONVERT._,"“That from your meetings I refrain, is true;"
9660,_THE CONVERT._,"I meet with nothing pleasant--nothing new,"
9661,_THE CONVERT._,"But the same proofs, that not one text explain,"
9662,_THE CONVERT._,"And the same lights, where all things dark remain;"
9663,_THE CONVERT._,I thought you saints on earth--but I have found
9664,_THE CONVERT._,"Some sins among you, and the best unsound;"
9665,_THE CONVERT._,"You have your failings, like the crowds below,"
9666,_THE CONVERT._,And at your pleasure hot and cold can blow.
9667,_THE CONVERT._,"When I at first your grave deportment saw,               270"
9668,_THE CONVERT._,"(I own my folly,) I was fill’d with awe;"
9669,_THE CONVERT._,"You spoke so warmly, and it [seemed] so well,"
9670,_THE CONVERT._,I should have thought it treason to rebel.
9671,_THE CONVERT._,Is it a wonder that a man like me
9672,_THE CONVERT._,Should such perfection in such teachers see;
9673,_THE CONVERT._,"Nay, should conceive you sent from Heav’n to brave"
9674,_THE CONVERT._,"The host of sin, and sinful souls to save?"
9675,_THE CONVERT._,"But, as our reason wakes, our prospects clear,"
9676,_THE CONVERT._,"And failings, flaws, and blemishes appear."
9677,_THE CONVERT._,"“When you were mounted in your rostrum high,           280"
9678,_THE CONVERT._,"We shrank beneath your tone, your frown, your eye;"
9679,_THE CONVERT._,"Then you beheld us abject, fallen, low,"
9680,_THE CONVERT._,And felt your glory from our baseness grow;
9681,_THE CONVERT._,"Touch’d by your words, I trembled like the rest,"
9682,_THE CONVERT._,And my own vileness and your power confess’d:
9683,_THE CONVERT._,"These, I exclaim’d, are men divine, and gazed"
9684,_THE CONVERT._,"On him who taught, delighted and amazed;"
9685,_THE CONVERT._,"Glad, when he finish’d, if by chance he cast"
9686,_THE CONVERT._,"One look on such a sinner, as he pass’d."
9687,_THE CONVERT._,"“But, when I view’d you in a clearer light,            290"
9688,_THE CONVERT._,And saw the frail and carnal appetite;
9689,_THE CONVERT._,"When, at his humble pray’r, you deign’d to eat,"
9690,_THE CONVERT._,"Saints as you are, a civil sinner’s meat;"
9691,_THE CONVERT._,"When, as you sat contented and at ease,"
9692,_THE CONVERT._,"Nibbling at leisure on the ducks and peas,"
9693,_THE CONVERT._,"And, pleased some comforts in such place to find,"
9694,_THE CONVERT._,You could descend to be a little kind;
9695,_THE CONVERT._,"And gave us hope, in Heaven there might be room"
9696,_THE CONVERT._,For a few souls beside your own to come;
9697,_THE CONVERT._,"While this world’s good engaged your carnal view,        300"
9698,_THE CONVERT._,And like a sinner you enjoy’d it too:
9699,_THE CONVERT._,"All this perceiving, can you think it strange"
9700,_THE CONVERT._,That change in you should work an equal change?”
9701,_THE CONVERT._,"“Wretch that thou art,” an elder cried, “and gone"
9702,_THE CONVERT._,"For everlasting”----“Go thyself,” said John;"
9703,_THE CONVERT._,"“Depart this instant, let me hear no more;"
9704,_THE CONVERT._,"My house my castle is, and that my door.”"
9705,_THE CONVERT._,"The hint they took, and from the door withdrew,"
9706,_THE CONVERT._,And John to meeting bade a long adieu;
9707,_THE CONVERT._,Attach’d to business; he in time became                  310
9708,_THE CONVERT._,A wealthy man of no inferior name.
9709,_THE CONVERT._,"It seem’d, alas! in John’s deluded sight,"
9710,_THE CONVERT._,That all was wrong because not all was right;
9711,_THE CONVERT._,"And, when he found his teachers had their stains,"
9712,_THE CONVERT._,Resentment and not reason broke his chains.
9713,_THE CONVERT._,"Thus on his feelings he again relied,"
9714,_THE CONVERT._,And never look’d to reason for his guide.
9715,_THE CONVERT._,"Could he have wisely view’d the frailty shown,"
9716,_THE CONVERT._,"And rightly weigh’d their wanderings and his own,"
9717,_THE CONVERT._,"He might have known that men may be sincere,             320"
9718,_THE CONVERT._,Though gay and feasting on the savoury cheer;
9719,_THE CONVERT._,"That doctrines sound and sober they may teach,"
9720,_THE CONVERT._,Who love to eat with all the glee they preach;
9721,_THE CONVERT._,"Nay, who believe the duck, the grape, the pine,"
9722,_THE CONVERT._,Were not intended for the dog and swine.
9723,_THE CONVERT._,But Dighton’s hasty mind on every theme
9724,_THE CONVERT._,"Ran from the truth, and rested in th’ extreme;"
9725,_THE CONVERT._,"Flaws in his friends he found, and then withdrew"
9726,_THE CONVERT._,(Vain of his knowledge) from their virtues too;
9727,_THE CONVERT._,"Best of his books he loved the liberal kind,             330"
9728,_THE CONVERT._,"That, if they improve not, still enlarge the mind;"
9729,_THE CONVERT._,"And found himself, with such advisers, free"
9730,_THE CONVERT._,"From a fix’d creed, as mind enlarged could be."
9731,_THE CONVERT._,"His humble wife at these opinions sigh’d,"
9732,_THE CONVERT._,But her he never heeded till she died;
9733,_THE CONVERT._,"He then assented to a last request,"
9734,_THE CONVERT._,And by the meeting-window let her rest;
9735,_THE CONVERT._,"And on her stone the sacred text was seen,"
9736,_THE CONVERT._,Which had her comfort in departing been.
9737,_THE CONVERT._,"Dighton with joy beheld his trade advance,             340"
9738,_THE CONVERT._,"Yet seldom published, loth to trust to chance;"
9739,_THE CONVERT._,"Then wed a doctor’s sister--poor indeed,"
9740,_THE CONVERT._,But skill’d in works her husband could not read;
9741,_THE CONVERT._,"Who, if he wish’d new ways of wealth to seek,"
9742,_THE CONVERT._,Could make her half-crown pamphlet in a week:
9743,_THE CONVERT._,"This he rejected, though without disdain,"
9744,_THE CONVERT._,And chose the old and certain way to gain.
9745,_THE CONVERT._,"Thus he proceeded; trade increased the while,"
9746,_THE CONVERT._,And fortune woo’d him with perpetual smile.
9747,_THE CONVERT._,"On early scenes he sometimes cast a thought,             350"
9748,_THE CONVERT._,When on his heart the mighty change was wrought;
9749,_THE CONVERT._,And all the ease and comfort converts find
9750,_THE CONVERT._,Was magnified in his reflecting mind;
9751,_THE CONVERT._,"Then on the teacher’s priestly pride he dwelt,"
9752,_THE CONVERT._,"That caused his freedom, but with this he felt"
9753,_THE CONVERT._,"The danger of the free--for since that day,"
9754,_THE CONVERT._,"No guide had shown, no brethren join’d his way;"
9755,_THE CONVERT._,"Forsaking one, he found no second creed,"
9756,_THE CONVERT._,"But reading doubted, doubting what to read."
9757,_THE CONVERT._,"Still, though reproof had brought some present pain,   360"
9758,_THE CONVERT._,The gain he made was fair and honest gain;
9759,_THE CONVERT._,"He laid his wares indeed in public view,"
9760,_THE CONVERT._,But that all traders claim a right to do.
9761,_THE CONVERT._,"By means like these, he saw his wealth increase,"
9762,_THE CONVERT._,"And felt his consequence, and dwelt in peace."
9763,_THE CONVERT._,"Our hero’s age was threescore years and five,"
9764,_THE CONVERT._,"When he exclaim’d, “Why longer should I strive?"
9765,_THE CONVERT._,"Why more amass, who never must behold"
9766,_THE CONVERT._,A young John Dighton to make glad the old?”
9767,_THE CONVERT._,"(The sons he had to early graves were gone,              370"
9768,_THE CONVERT._,And girls were burdens to the mind of John.)
9769,_THE CONVERT._,"“Had I [a] boy, he would our name sustain,"
9770,_THE CONVERT._,That now to nothing must return again;
9771,_THE CONVERT._,"But what are all my profits, credit, trade,"
9772,_THE CONVERT._,And parish-honours?--folly and parade.”
9773,_THE CONVERT._,"Thus Dighton thought, and in his looks appear’d"
9774,_THE CONVERT._,"Sadness, increased by much he saw and heard."
9775,_THE CONVERT._,"The brethren often at the shop would stay,"
9776,_THE CONVERT._,And make their comments ere they walk’d away;
9777,_THE CONVERT._,"They mark’d the window, fill’d in every pane             380"
9778,_THE CONVERT._,With lawless prints of reputations slain;
9779,_THE CONVERT._,"Distorted forms of men with honours graced,"
9780,_THE CONVERT._,And our chief rulers in derision placed:
9781,_THE CONVERT._,"Amazed they stood, remembering well the days,"
9782,_THE CONVERT._,When to be humble was their brother’s praise;
9783,_THE CONVERT._,When at the dwelling of their friend they stopp’d
9784,_THE CONVERT._,"To drop a word, or to receive it dropp’d;"
9785,_THE CONVERT._,"Where they beheld the prints of men renown’d,"
9786,_THE CONVERT._,And far-famed preachers pasted all around;
9787,_THE CONVERT._,(Such mouths! eyes! hair! so prim! so fierce! so sleek!  390
9788,_THE CONVERT._,They look’d as speaking what is wo to speak):
9789,_THE CONVERT._,On these the passing brethren loved to dwell--
9790,_THE CONVERT._,How long they spake! how strongly! warmly! well!
9791,_THE CONVERT._,"What power had each to dive in mysteries deep,"
9792,_THE CONVERT._,"To warm the cold, to make the harden’d weep;"
9793,_THE CONVERT._,"To lure, to fright, to soothe, to awe the soul,"
9794,_THE CONVERT._,And list’ning flocks to lead and to control!
9795,_THE CONVERT._,"But now discoursing, as they linger’d near,"
9796,_THE CONVERT._,They tempted John (whom they accused) to hear
9797,_THE CONVERT._,"Their weighty charge--“And can the lost-one feel,        400"
9798,_THE CONVERT._,"As in the time of duty, love, and zeal:"
9799,_THE CONVERT._,"When all were summon’d at the rising sun,"
9800,_THE CONVERT._,And he was ready with his friends to run;
9801,_THE CONVERT._,"When he, partaking with a chosen few,"
9802,_THE CONVERT._,"Felt the great change, sensation rich and new?"
9803,_THE CONVERT._,"No! all is lost, her favours Fortune shower’d"
9804,_THE CONVERT._,"Upon the man, and he is overpower’d;"
9805,_THE CONVERT._,The world has won him with its tempting store
9806,_THE CONVERT._,"Of needless wealth, and that has made him poor."
9807,_THE CONVERT._,"Success undoes him; he has risen to fall,                410"
9808,_THE CONVERT._,"Has gain’d a fortune, and has lost his all;"
9809,_THE CONVERT._,"Gone back from Sion, he will find his age"
9810,_THE CONVERT._,Loth to commence a second pilgrimage;
9811,_THE CONVERT._,He has retreated from the chosen track;
9812,_THE CONVERT._,And now must ever bear the burden on his back.”
9813,_THE CONVERT._,"Hurt by such censure, John began to find"
9814,_THE CONVERT._,Fresh revolutions working in his mind;
9815,_THE CONVERT._,"He sought for comfort in his books, but read"
9816,_THE CONVERT._,Without a plan or method in his head;
9817,_THE CONVERT._,"What once amused, now rather made him sad,               420"
9818,_THE CONVERT._,"What should inform, increased the doubts he had;"
9819,_THE CONVERT._,"Shame would not let him seek at church a guide,"
9820,_THE CONVERT._,And from his meeting he was held by pride;
9821,_THE CONVERT._,"His wife derided fears she never felt,"
9822,_THE CONVERT._,And passing brethren daily censures dealt;
9823,_THE CONVERT._,"Hope for a son was now for ever past,"
9824,_THE CONVERT._,"He was the first John Dighton, and the last;"
9825,_THE CONVERT._,"His stomach fail’d, his case the doctor knew,"
9826,_THE CONVERT._,"But said, “he still might hold a year or two.”"
9827,_THE CONVERT._,"“No more?” he said, “but why should I complain?          430"
9828,_THE CONVERT._,A life of doubt must be a life of pain.
9829,_THE CONVERT._,Could I be sure--but why should I despair?
9830,_THE CONVERT._,I’m sure my conduct has been just and fair;
9831,_THE CONVERT._,"In youth indeed I had a wicked will,"
9832,_THE CONVERT._,"But I repented, and have sorrow still;"
9833,_THE CONVERT._,"I had my comforts, and a growing trade"
9834,_THE CONVERT._,Gave greater pleasure than a fortune made;
9835,_THE CONVERT._,"And, as I more possess’d and reason’d more,"
9836,_THE CONVERT._,"I lost those comforts I enjoy’d before,"
9837,_THE CONVERT._,"When reverend guides I saw my table round,               440"
9838,_THE CONVERT._,And in my guardian guest my safety found.
9839,_THE CONVERT._,"Now sick and sad, no appetite, no ease,"
9840,_THE CONVERT._,"Nor pleasure have I, nor a wish to please;"
9841,_THE CONVERT._,"Nor views, nor hopes, nor plans, nor taste have I,"
9842,_THE CONVERT._,"Yet sick of life, have no desire to die.”"
9843,_THE CONVERT._,"He said, and died; his trade, his name is gone,"
9844,_THE CONVERT._,And all that once gave consequence to John.
9845,_THE CONVERT._,"Unhappy Dighton! had he found a friend,"
9846,_THE CONVERT._,When conscience told him it was time to mend!
9847,_THE CONVERT._,"A friend discreet, considerate, kind, sincere,           450"
9848,_THE CONVERT._,Who would have shown the grounds of hope and fear;
9849,_THE CONVERT._,"And proved that spirits, whether high or low,"
9850,_THE CONVERT._,No certain tokens of man’s safety show;
9851,_THE CONVERT._,"Had reason ruled him in her proper place,"
9852,_THE CONVERT._,And virtue led him while he lean’d on grace;
9853,_THE CONVERT._,"Had he while zealous been discreet and pure,"
9854,_THE CONVERT._,"His knowledge humble, and his hope secure--"
9855,_THE CONVERT._,"These guides had placed him on the solid rock,"
9856,_THE CONVERT._,"Where faith had rested, nor received a shock;"
9857,_THE CONVERT._,"But his, alas! was placed upon the sand,                 460"

9887,_THE BROTHERS._,Than old George Fletcher on the British coast
9888,_THE BROTHERS._,Dwelt not a seaman who had more to boast:
9889,_THE BROTHERS._,"Kind, simple, and sincere--he seldom spoke,"
9890,_THE BROTHERS._,But sometimes sang and chorus’d “_Hearts of Oak_;”
9891,_THE BROTHERS._,"In dangers steady, with his lot content,"
9892,_THE BROTHERS._,His days in labour and in love were spent.
9893,_THE BROTHERS._,"He left a son so like him, that the old"
9894,_THE BROTHERS._,"With joy exclaim’d, “’Tis Fletcher we behold;”"
9895,_THE BROTHERS._,"But to his brother when the kinsmen came,"
9896,_THE BROTHERS._,"And view’d his form, they grudged the father’s name.      10"
9897,_THE BROTHERS._,"George was a bold, intrepid, careless lad,"
9898,_THE BROTHERS._,With just the failings that his father had;
9899,_THE BROTHERS._,"Isaac was weak, attentive, slow, exact,"
9900,_THE BROTHERS._,With just the virtues that his father lack’d.
9901,_THE BROTHERS._,George lived at sea: upon the land a guest--
9902,_THE BROTHERS._,"He sought for recreation, not for rest--"
9903,_THE BROTHERS._,"While, far unlike, his brother’s feebler form"
9904,_THE BROTHERS._,"Shrank from the cold, and shudder’d at the storm;"
9905,_THE BROTHERS._,"Still with the seaman’s to connect his trade,"
9906,_THE BROTHERS._,The boy was bound where blocks and ropes were made.       20
9907,_THE BROTHERS._,"George, strong and sturdy, had a tender mind,"
9908,_THE BROTHERS._,And was to Isaac pitiful and kind;
9909,_THE BROTHERS._,"A very father, till his art was gain’d,"
9910,_THE BROTHERS._,And then a friend unwearied he remain’d.
9911,_THE BROTHERS._,"He saw his brother was of spirit low,"
9912,_THE BROTHERS._,"His temper peevish, and his motions slow;"
9913,_THE BROTHERS._,"Not fit to bustle in a world, or make"
9914,_THE BROTHERS._,Friends to his fortune for his merit’s sake:
9915,_THE BROTHERS._,But the kind sailor could not boast the art
9916,_THE BROTHERS._,Of looking deeply in the human heart;                     30
9917,_THE BROTHERS._,Else had he seen that this weak brother knew
9918,_THE BROTHERS._,What men to court--what objects to pursue;
9919,_THE BROTHERS._,"That he to distant gain the way discern’d,"
9920,_THE BROTHERS._,And none so crooked but his genius learn’d.
9921,_THE BROTHERS._,"Isaac was poor, and this the brother felt;"
9922,_THE BROTHERS._,"He hired a house, and there the landman dwelt;"
9923,_THE BROTHERS._,"Wrought at his trade, and had an easy home,"
9924,_THE BROTHERS._,For there would George with cash and comforts come;
9925,_THE BROTHERS._,"And, when they parted, Isaac look’d around,"
9926,_THE BROTHERS._,Where other friends and helpers might be found.           40
9927,_THE BROTHERS._,"He wish’d for some port-place, and one might fall,"
9928,_THE BROTHERS._,"He wisely thought, if he should try for all;"
9929,_THE BROTHERS._,"He had a vote--and, were it well applied,"
9930,_THE BROTHERS._,Might have its worth--and he had views beside;
9931,_THE BROTHERS._,Old Burgess Steel was able to promote
9932,_THE BROTHERS._,An humble man who served him with a vote;
9933,_THE BROTHERS._,"For Isaac felt not what some tempers feel,"
9934,_THE BROTHERS._,But bow’d and bent the neck to Burgess Steel;
9935,_THE BROTHERS._,"And great attention to a lady gave,"
9936,_THE BROTHERS._,"His ancient friend, a maiden spare and grave:             50"
9937,_THE BROTHERS._,One whom the visage long and look demure
9938,_THE BROTHERS._,Of Isaac pleased--he seem’d sedate and pure;
9939,_THE BROTHERS._,And his soft heart conceived a gentle flame
9940,_THE BROTHERS._,For her who waited on this virtuous dame:
9941,_THE BROTHERS._,"Not an outrageous love, a scorching fire,"
9942,_THE BROTHERS._,But friendly liking and chastised desire;
9943,_THE BROTHERS._,"And thus he waited, patient in delay,"
9944,_THE BROTHERS._,In present favour and in fortune’s way.
9945,_THE BROTHERS._,"George then was coasting--war was yet delay’d,"
9946,_THE BROTHERS._,And what he gain’d was to his brother paid;               60
9947,_THE BROTHERS._,Nor ask’d the seaman what he saved or spent:
9948,_THE BROTHERS._,"But took his grog, wrought hard, and was content;"
9949,_THE BROTHERS._,"Till war awaked the land, and George began"
9950,_THE BROTHERS._,To think what part became a useful man:
9951,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Press’d, I must go; why, then, ’tis better far"
9952,_THE BROTHERS._,"At once to enter like a British tar,"
9953,_THE BROTHERS._,"Than a brave captain and the foe to shun,"
9954,_THE BROTHERS._,As if I fear’d the music of a gun.”
9955,_THE BROTHERS._,“Go not!” said Isaac--“You shall wear disguise.”
9956,_THE BROTHERS._,"“What!” said the seaman, “clothe myself with lies?”--    70"
9957,_THE BROTHERS._,“Oh! but there’s danger.”--“Danger in the fleet?
9958,_THE BROTHERS._,"You cannot mean, good brother, of defeat;"
9959,_THE BROTHERS._,And other dangers I at land must share--
9960,_THE BROTHERS._,So now adieu! and trust a brother’s care.”
9961,_THE BROTHERS._,"Isaac awhile demurr’d--but, in his heart,"
9962,_THE BROTHERS._,"So might he share, he was disposed to part:"
9963,_THE BROTHERS._,The better mind will sometimes feel the pain               }
9964,_THE BROTHERS._,Of benefactions--favour is a chain;                        }
9965,_THE BROTHERS._,"But they the feeling scorn, and what they wish, disdain;-- }"
9966,_THE BROTHERS._,While beings form’d in coarser mould will hate            80
9967,_THE BROTHERS._,The helping hand they ought to venerate.
9968,_THE BROTHERS._,"No wonder George should in this cause prevail,"
9969,_THE BROTHERS._,With one contending who was glad to fail:
9970,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Isaac, farewell! do wipe that doleful eye;   }"
9971,_THE BROTHERS._,"Crying we came, and groaning we may die.      }"
9972,_THE BROTHERS._,Let us do something ’twixt the groan and cry: }
9973,_THE BROTHERS._,"And hear me, brother, whether pay or prize,"
9974,_THE BROTHERS._,One half to thee I give and I devise;
9975,_THE BROTHERS._,For thou hast oft occasion for the aid
9976,_THE BROTHERS._,"Of learn’d physicians, and they will be paid:             90"
9977,_THE BROTHERS._,"Their wives and children men support, at sea,"
9978,_THE BROTHERS._,"And thou, my lad, art wife and child to me:"
9979,_THE BROTHERS._,"Farewell!--I go where hope and honour call,"
9980,_THE BROTHERS._,Nor does it follow that who fights must fall.”
9981,_THE BROTHERS._,"Isaac here made a poor attempt to speak,"
9982,_THE BROTHERS._,And a huge tear moved slowly down his cheek;
9983,_THE BROTHERS._,"Like Pluto’s iron drop, hard sign of grace,         }"
9984,_THE BROTHERS._,"It slowly roll’d upon the rueful face,              }"
9985,_THE BROTHERS._,Forced by the striving will alone its way to trace. }
9986,_THE BROTHERS._,"Years fled--war lasted--George at sea remain’d,        100"
9987,_THE BROTHERS._,While the slow landman still his profits gain’d.
9988,_THE BROTHERS._,A humble place was vacant--he besought
9989,_THE BROTHERS._,"His patron’s interest, and the office caught;"
9990,_THE BROTHERS._,"For still the virgin was his faithful friend,"
9991,_THE BROTHERS._,"And one so sober could with truth commend,"
9992,_THE BROTHERS._,"Who of his own defects most humbly thought,"
9993,_THE BROTHERS._,And their advice with zeal and reverence sought.
9994,_THE BROTHERS._,"Whom thus the mistress praised, the maid approved,"
9995,_THE BROTHERS._,And her he wedded whom he wisely loved.
9996,_THE BROTHERS._,"No more he needs assistance--but, alas!                110"
9997,_THE BROTHERS._,He fears the money will for liquor pass;
9998,_THE BROTHERS._,"Or that the seaman might to flatterers lend,"
9999,_THE BROTHERS._,Or give support to some pretended friend.
10000,_THE BROTHERS._,"Still, he must write--he wrote, and he confess’d"
10001,_THE BROTHERS._,"That, till absolved, he should be sore distress’d;"
10002,_THE BROTHERS._,"But one so friendly would, he thought, forgive"
10003,_THE BROTHERS._,The hasty deed--Heav’n knew how he should live;
10004,_THE BROTHERS._,"“But you,” he added, “as a man of sense,"
10005,_THE BROTHERS._,Have well consider’d danger and expense:
10006,_THE BROTHERS._,"I ran, alas! into the fatal snare,                       120"
10007,_THE BROTHERS._,And now for trouble must my mind prepare;
10008,_THE BROTHERS._,"And how, with children, I shall pick my way,"
10009,_THE BROTHERS._,"Through a hard world, is more than I can say:"
10010,_THE BROTHERS._,"Then change not, brother, your more happy state,"
10011,_THE BROTHERS._,Or on the hazard long deliberate.”
10012,_THE BROTHERS._,"George answer’d gravely, “It is right and fit,"
10013,_THE BROTHERS._,"In all our crosses, humbly to submit:"
10014,_THE BROTHERS._,"Your apprehensions are unwise, unjust;"
10015,_THE BROTHERS._,"Forbear repining, and expel distrust.”--"
10016,_THE BROTHERS._,"He added, “Marriage was the joy of life,”                130"
10017,_THE BROTHERS._,And gave his service to his brother’s wife;
10018,_THE BROTHERS._,"Then vow’d to bear in all expense a part,"
10019,_THE BROTHERS._,"And thus concluded, “Have a cheerful heart.”"
10020,_THE BROTHERS._,"Had the glad Isaac been his brother’s guide,"
10021,_THE BROTHERS._,In these same terms the seaman had replied;
10022,_THE BROTHERS._,"At such reproofs the crafty landman smiled,"
10023,_THE BROTHERS._,And softly said--“This creature is a child.”
10024,_THE BROTHERS._,Twice had the gallant ship a capture made--
10025,_THE BROTHERS._,"And when in port the happy crew were paid,"
10026,_THE BROTHERS._,"Home went the sailor, with his pocket stored,            140"
10027,_THE BROTHERS._,"Ease to enjoy, and pleasure to afford."
10028,_THE BROTHERS._,His time was short; joy shone in every face;
10029,_THE BROTHERS._,Isaac half fainted in the fond embrace;
10030,_THE BROTHERS._,"The wife resolved her honour’d guest to please,"
10031,_THE BROTHERS._,The children clung upon their uncle’s knees;
10032,_THE BROTHERS._,"The grog went round, the neighbours drank his health,"
10033,_THE BROTHERS._,And George exclaim’d--“Ah! what to this is wealth?
10034,_THE BROTHERS._,"Better,” said he, “to bear a loving heart,"
10035,_THE BROTHERS._,Than roll in riches----but we now must part!”
10036,_THE BROTHERS._,All yet is still--but hark! the winds o’ersweep        150
10037,_THE BROTHERS._,"The rising waves, and howl upon the deep;"
10038,_THE BROTHERS._,"Ships, late becalm’d, on mountain-billows ride--"
10039,_THE BROTHERS._,"So life is threaten’d, and so man is tried."
10040,_THE BROTHERS._,Ill were the tidings that arrived from sea:
10041,_THE BROTHERS._,The worthy George must now a cripple be;
10042,_THE BROTHERS._,"His leg was lopp’d; and, though his heart was sound,"
10043,_THE BROTHERS._,Though his brave captain was with glory crown’d--
10044,_THE BROTHERS._,"Yet much it vex’d him to repose on shore,"
10045,_THE BROTHERS._,"An idle log, and be of use no more."
10046,_THE BROTHERS._,"True, he was sure that Isaac would receive               160"
10047,_THE BROTHERS._,All of his brother that the foe might leave;
10048,_THE BROTHERS._,"To whom the seaman his design had sent,"
10049,_THE BROTHERS._,Ere from the port the wounded hero went;
10050,_THE BROTHERS._,"His wealth and expectations told, he “knew"
10051,_THE BROTHERS._,"Wherein they fail’d, what Isaac’s love would do;"
10052,_THE BROTHERS._,"That he the grog and cabin would supply,"
10053,_THE BROTHERS._,Where George at anchor during life would lie.”
10054,_THE BROTHERS._,"The landman read--and, reading, grew distress’d:--"
10055,_THE BROTHERS._,“Could he resolve t’ admit so poor a guest?
10056,_THE BROTHERS._,"Better at Greenwich might the sailor stay,               170"
10057,_THE BROTHERS._,Unless his purse could for his comforts pay;”
10058,_THE BROTHERS._,"So Isaac judged, and to his wife appeal’d,"
10059,_THE BROTHERS._,But yet acknowledged it was best to yield:
10060,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Perhaps his pension, with what sums remain"
10061,_THE BROTHERS._,"Due or unsquander’d, may the man maintain;"
10062,_THE BROTHERS._,Refuse we must not.”--With a heavy sigh
10063,_THE BROTHERS._,"The lady heard, and made her kind reply:"
10064,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Nor would I wish it, Isaac, were we sure"
10065,_THE BROTHERS._,How long his crazy building will endure;
10066,_THE BROTHERS._,"Like an old house, that every day appears                180"
10067,_THE BROTHERS._,About to fall--he may be propp’d for years;
10068,_THE BROTHERS._,"For a few months, indeed, we might comply,"
10069,_THE BROTHERS._,But these old batter’d fellows never die.”
10070,_THE BROTHERS._,"The hand of Isaac George on entering took,"
10071,_THE BROTHERS._,With love and resignation in his look;
10072,_THE BROTHERS._,"Declared his comfort in the fortune past,"
10073,_THE BROTHERS._,And joy to find his anchor safely cast;
10074,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Call then my nephews, let the grog be brought,"
10075,_THE BROTHERS._,And I will tell them how the ship was fought.”
10076,_THE BROTHERS._,"Alas! our simple seaman should have known,      }     190"
10077,_THE BROTHERS._,"That all the care, the kindness, he had shown,    }"
10078,_THE BROTHERS._,"Were from his brother’s heart, if not his memory, }"
10079,_THE BROTHERS._,flown:                                }
10080,_THE BROTHERS._,"All swept away to be perceived no more,"
10081,_THE BROTHERS._,Like idle structures on the sandy shore;
10082,_THE BROTHERS._,"The chance amusement of the playful boy,"
10083,_THE BROTHERS._,That the rude billows in their rage destroy.
10084,_THE BROTHERS._,"Poor George confess’d, though loth the truth to find,"
10085,_THE BROTHERS._,Slight was his knowledge of a brother’s mind:
10086,_THE BROTHERS._,"The vulgar pipe was to the wife offence,"
10087,_THE BROTHERS._,The frequent grog to Isaac an expense;                   200
10088,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Would friends like hers,” she question’d, “choose to come,"
10089,_THE BROTHERS._,Where clouds of poison’d fume defiled a room?
10090,_THE BROTHERS._,"This could their lady-friend, and Burgess Steel,"
10091,_THE BROTHERS._,(Teased with his worship’s asthma) bear to feel?
10092,_THE BROTHERS._,Could they associate or converse with him--
10093,_THE BROTHERS._,A loud rough sailor with a timber limb?”
10094,_THE BROTHERS._,"Cold as he grew, still Isaac strove to show,"
10095,_THE BROTHERS._,"By well-feign’d care, that cold he could not grow;"
10096,_THE BROTHERS._,"And when he saw his brother look distress’d,"
10097,_THE BROTHERS._,He strove some petty comforts to suggest;                210
10098,_THE BROTHERS._,"On his wife solely their neglect to lay,"
10099,_THE BROTHERS._,And then t’ excuse it as a woman’s way;
10100,_THE BROTHERS._,"He too was chidden when her rules he broke,"
10101,_THE BROTHERS._,And then she sicken’d at the scent of smoke.
10102,_THE BROTHERS._,"George, though in doubt, was still consoled to find"
10103,_THE BROTHERS._,His brother wishing to be reckon’d kind.
10104,_THE BROTHERS._,"That Isaac seem’d concern’d by his distress,"
10105,_THE BROTHERS._,Gave to his injured feelings some redress;
10106,_THE BROTHERS._,But none he found disposed to lend an ear
10107,_THE BROTHERS._,To stories all were once intent to hear;                 220
10108,_THE BROTHERS._,"Except his nephew, seated on his knee,"
10109,_THE BROTHERS._,He found no creature cared about the sea;
10110,_THE BROTHERS._,"But George indeed--for George they call’d the boy,"
10111,_THE BROTHERS._,When his good uncle was their boast and joy--
10112,_THE BROTHERS._,"Would listen long, and would contend with sleep,"
10113,_THE BROTHERS._,To hear the woes and wonders of the deep;
10114,_THE BROTHERS._,Till the fond mother cried--“That man will teach
10115,_THE BROTHERS._,The foolish boy his loud and boisterous speech.”
10116,_THE BROTHERS._,So judged the father--and the boy was taught
10117,_THE BROTHERS._,"To shun the uncle, whom his love had sought.             230"
10118,_THE BROTHERS._,"The mask of kindness now but seldom worn,"
10119,_THE BROTHERS._,George felt each evil harder to be borne;
10120,_THE BROTHERS._,"And cried (vexation growing day by day),"
10121,_THE BROTHERS._,“Ah! brother Isaac!--What! I’m in the way!”--
10122,_THE BROTHERS._,"“No! on my credit, look ye, No! but I          }"
10123,_THE BROTHERS._,"Am fond of peace, and my repose would buy      }"
10124,_THE BROTHERS._,"On any terms--in short, we must comply:        }"
10125,_THE BROTHERS._,My spouse had money--she must have her will--
10126,_THE BROTHERS._,Ah! brother--marriage is a bitter pill.”--
10127,_THE BROTHERS._,"George tried the lady--“Sister, I offend”--           240"
10128,_THE BROTHERS._,“Me?” she replied; “Oh no!--you may depend
10129,_THE BROTHERS._,"On my regard--but watch your brother’s way,"
10130,_THE BROTHERS._,"Whom I, like you, must study and obey.”"
10131,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Ah!” thought the seaman, “what a head was mine,"
10132,_THE BROTHERS._,That easy birth at Greenwich to resign!
10133,_THE BROTHERS._,"I’ll to the parish”--but a little pride,"
10134,_THE BROTHERS._,"And some affection, put the thought aside."
10135,_THE BROTHERS._,Now gross neglect and open scorn he bore
10136,_THE BROTHERS._,In silent sorrow--but he felt the more;
10137,_THE BROTHERS._,"The odious pipe he to the kitchen took,                  250"
10138,_THE BROTHERS._,Or strove to profit by some pious book.
10139,_THE BROTHERS._,"When the mind stoops to this degraded state,"
10140,_THE BROTHERS._,New griefs will darken the dependent’s fate;
10141,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Brother!” said Isaac, “you will sure excuse"
10142,_THE BROTHERS._,The little freedom I’m compell’d to use:
10143,_THE BROTHERS._,My wife’s relations--(curse the haughty crew)--
10144,_THE BROTHERS._,"Affect such niceness, and such dread of you:"
10145,_THE BROTHERS._,You speak so loud--and they have natures soft--
10146,_THE BROTHERS._,Brother----I wish----do go upon the loft!”
10147,_THE BROTHERS._,"Poor George obey’d, and to the garret fled,            260"
10148,_THE BROTHERS._,Where not a being saw the tears he shed.
10149,_THE BROTHERS._,"But more was yet required, for guests were come,"
10150,_THE BROTHERS._,Who could not dine if he disgraced the room.
10151,_THE BROTHERS._,It shock’d his spirit to be esteem’d unfit
10152,_THE BROTHERS._,With an own brother and his wife to sit;
10153,_THE BROTHERS._,He grew rebellious--at the vestry spoke
10154,_THE BROTHERS._,For weekly aid----they heard it as a joke:
10155,_THE BROTHERS._,"So kind a brother, and so wealthy----you"
10156,_THE BROTHERS._,Apply to us?----No! this will never do:
10157,_THE BROTHERS._,"Good neighbour Fletcher,” said the overseer,             270"
10158,_THE BROTHERS._,“We are engaged--you can have nothing here!”
10159,_THE BROTHERS._,"George mutter’d something in despairing tone,"
10160,_THE BROTHERS._,"Then sought his loft, to think and grieve alone;"
10161,_THE BROTHERS._,"Neglected, slighted, restless on his bed,"
10162,_THE BROTHERS._,"With heart half broken, and with scraps ill fed;"
10163,_THE BROTHERS._,Yet was he pleased that hours for play design’d
10164,_THE BROTHERS._,Were given to ease his ever-troubled mind;
10165,_THE BROTHERS._,"The child still listen’d with increasing joy,"
10166,_THE BROTHERS._,And he was soothed by the attentive boy.
10167,_THE BROTHERS._,"At length he sicken’d, and this duteous child          280"
10168,_THE BROTHERS._,"Watch’d o’er his sickness, and his pains beguiled;"
10169,_THE BROTHERS._,"The mother bade him from the loft refrain,"
10170,_THE BROTHERS._,"But, though with caution, yet he went again;"
10171,_THE BROTHERS._,"And now his tales the sailor feebly told,"
10172,_THE BROTHERS._,"His heart was heavy, and his limbs were cold:"
10173,_THE BROTHERS._,The tender boy came often to entreat
10174,_THE BROTHERS._,"His good kind friend would of his presents eat,"
10175,_THE BROTHERS._,"Purloin’d or purchased; for he saw, with shame,"
10176,_THE BROTHERS._,The food untouch’d that to his uncle came:
10177,_THE BROTHERS._,"Who, sick in body and in mind, received                  290"
10178,_THE BROTHERS._,"The boy’s indulgence, gratified and grieved."
10179,_THE BROTHERS._,“Uncle will die!” said George--the piteous wife
10180,_THE BROTHERS._,"Exclaim’d, “she saw no value in his life;"
10181,_THE BROTHERS._,"But sick or well, to my commands attend,"
10182,_THE BROTHERS._,And go no more to your complaining friend.”
10183,_THE BROTHERS._,"The boy was vex’d, he felt his heart reprove"
10184,_THE BROTHERS._,The stern decree.--What! punish’d for his love!
10185,_THE BROTHERS._,"No! he would go, but softly, to the room"
10186,_THE BROTHERS._,Stealing in silence--for he knew his doom.
10187,_THE BROTHERS._,"Once in a week the father came to say,                 300"
10188,_THE BROTHERS._,"“George, are you ill?”--and hurried him away;"
10189,_THE BROTHERS._,"Yet to his wife would on their duties dwell,"
10190,_THE BROTHERS._,"And often cry, “Do use my brother well;”"
10191,_THE BROTHERS._,"And something kind, no question, Isaac meant,"
10192,_THE BROTHERS._,Who took vast credit for the vague intent.
10193,_THE BROTHERS._,"But, truly kind, the gentle boy essay’d"
10194,_THE BROTHERS._,"To cheer his uncle, firm, although afraid;"
10195,_THE BROTHERS._,"But now the father caught him at the door,"
10196,_THE BROTHERS._,"And, swearing--yes, the man in office swore,"
10197,_THE BROTHERS._,"And cried, “Away! How! Brother, I’m surprised,           310"
10198,_THE BROTHERS._,That one so old can be so ill advised.
10199,_THE BROTHERS._,"Let him not dare to visit you again,"
10200,_THE BROTHERS._,Your cursed stories will disturb his brain;
10201,_THE BROTHERS._,"Is it not vile to court a foolish boy,"
10202,_THE BROTHERS._,Your own absurd narrations to enjoy?
10203,_THE BROTHERS._,"What! sullen!--ha! George Fletcher? you shall see,"
10204,_THE BROTHERS._,"Proud as you are, your bread depends on me!”"
10205,_THE BROTHERS._,"He spoke, and, frowning, to his dinner went,"
10206,_THE BROTHERS._,Then cool’d and felt some qualms of discontent;
10207,_THE BROTHERS._,And thought on times when he compell’d his son           320
10208,_THE BROTHERS._,"To hear these stories, nay, to beg for one;"
10209,_THE BROTHERS._,"But the wife’s wrath o’ercame the brother’s pain,"
10210,_THE BROTHERS._,"And shame was felt, and conscience rose in vain."
10211,_THE BROTHERS._,George yet stole up--he saw his uncle lie
10212,_THE BROTHERS._,"Sick on the bed, and heard his heavy sigh:"
10213,_THE BROTHERS._,"So he resolved, before he went to rest,"
10214,_THE BROTHERS._,To comfort one so dear and so distress’d;
10215,_THE BROTHERS._,"Then watch’d his time, but, with a child-like art,"
10216,_THE BROTHERS._,Betray’d a something treasured at his heart.
10217,_THE BROTHERS._,"Th’ observant wife remark’d, “the boy is grown           330"
10218,_THE BROTHERS._,"So like your brother, that he seems his own;"
10219,_THE BROTHERS._,So close and sullen! and I still suspect
10220,_THE BROTHERS._,They often meet--do watch them and detect.”
10221,_THE BROTHERS._,"George now remark’d that all was still as night,"
10222,_THE BROTHERS._,And hasten’d up with terror and delight;
10223,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Uncle!” he cried, and softly tapp’d the door;"
10224,_THE BROTHERS._,“Do let me in”--but he could add no more;
10225,_THE BROTHERS._,"The careful father caught him in the fact,"
10226,_THE BROTHERS._,"And cried, “You serpent! is it thus you act?"
10227,_THE BROTHERS._,"Back to your mother!” and, with hasty blow,              340"
10228,_THE BROTHERS._,He sent th’ indignant boy to grieve below;
10229,_THE BROTHERS._,Then at the door an angry speech began:
10230,_THE BROTHERS._,“Is this your conduct--is it thus you plan?
10231,_THE BROTHERS._,"Seduce my child, and make my house a scene"
10232,_THE BROTHERS._,Of vile dispute--What is it that you mean?--
10233,_THE BROTHERS._,"George, are you dumb? do learn to know your friends,"
10234,_THE BROTHERS._,And think awhile on whom your bread depends.--
10235,_THE BROTHERS._,What! not a word? be thankful I am cool;
10236,_THE BROTHERS._,"But, sir, beware, nor longer play the fool.--"
10237,_THE BROTHERS._,"Come! brother, come! what is that you seek               350"
10238,_THE BROTHERS._,"By this rebellion?--Speak, you villain, speak!--"
10239,_THE BROTHERS._,"Weeping! I warrant, sorrow makes you dumb;"
10240,_THE BROTHERS._,"I’ll ope your mouth, impostor! if I come."
10241,_THE BROTHERS._,"Let me approach--I’ll shake you from the bed,"
10242,_THE BROTHERS._,You stubborn dog----Oh God! my brother’s dead!----”
10243,_THE BROTHERS._,"Timid was Isaac, and in all the past"
10244,_THE BROTHERS._,He felt a purpose to be kind at last;
10245,_THE BROTHERS._,"Nor did he mean his brother to depart,"
10246,_THE BROTHERS._,Till he had shown this kindness of his heart:
10247,_THE BROTHERS._,"But day by day he put the cause aside,                   360"
10248,_THE BROTHERS._,"Induced by av’rice, peevishness, or pride."
10249,_THE BROTHERS._,"But, now awaken’d, from this fatal time"
10250,_THE BROTHERS._,"His conscience Isaac felt, and found his crime:"
10251,_THE BROTHERS._,"He raised to George a monumental stone,"
10252,_THE BROTHERS._,And there retired to sigh and think alone;
10253,_THE BROTHERS._,"An ague seized him, he grew pale, and shook--"
10254,_THE BROTHERS._,"“So,” said his son, “would my poor uncle look.”--"
10255,_THE BROTHERS._,"“And so, my child, shall I like him expire.”--"
10256,_THE BROTHERS._,“No! you have physic and a cheerful fire.”--
10257,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Unhappy sinner! yes, I’m well supplied                  370"
10258,_THE BROTHERS._,With every comfort my cold heart denied.”
10259,_THE BROTHERS._,"He view’d his brother now, but not as one"
10260,_THE BROTHERS._,Who vex’d his wife by fondness for her son;
10261,_THE BROTHERS._,"Not as with wooden limb, and seaman’s tale,"
10262,_THE BROTHERS._,"The odious pipe, vile grog, or humbler ale:"
10263,_THE BROTHERS._,He now the worth and grief alone can view
10264,_THE BROTHERS._,"Of one so mild, so generous, and so true:"
10265,_THE BROTHERS._,"The frank, kind brother, with such open heart,"
10266,_THE BROTHERS._,And I to break it--’twas a dæmon’s part!”
10267,_THE BROTHERS._,"So Isaac now, as led by conscience, feels,             380"
10268,_THE BROTHERS._,Nor his unkindness palliates or conceals.
10269,_THE BROTHERS._,"“This is your folly,” said his heartless wife;"
10270,_THE BROTHERS._,“Alas! my folly cost my brother’s life:
10271,_THE BROTHERS._,"It suffer’d him to languish and decay,               }"
10272,_THE BROTHERS._,"My gentle brother, whom I could not pay,             }"
10273,_THE BROTHERS._,"And therefore left to pine, and fret his life away.” }"
10274,_THE BROTHERS._,"He takes his son, and bids the boy unfold"
10275,_THE BROTHERS._,"All the good uncle of his feelings told,"
10276,_THE BROTHERS._,All he lamented--and the ready tear
10277,_THE BROTHERS._,"Falls as he listens, soothed and grieved to hear.        390"
10278,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Did he not curse me, child?”--“He never cursed,"
10279,_THE BROTHERS._,"But could not breathe, and said his heart would burst”--"
10280,_THE BROTHERS._,"“And so will mine.”--“Then, father, you must pray;"
10281,_THE BROTHERS._,My uncle said it took his pains away.”
10282,_THE BROTHERS._,"Repeating thus his sorrows, Isaac shows           }"
10283,_THE BROTHERS._,"That he, repenting, feels the debt he owes,         }"
10284,_THE BROTHERS._,And from this source alone his every comfort flows. }
10285,_THE BROTHERS._,"He takes no joy in office, honours, gain;"
10286,_THE BROTHERS._,"They make him humble, nay, they give him pain;"
10287,_THE BROTHERS._,"“These from my heart,” he cries, “all feeling drove;     400"
10288,_THE BROTHERS._,"They made me cold to nature, dead to love.”"
10289,_THE BROTHERS._,"He takes no joy in home, but, sighing, sees"
10290,_THE BROTHERS._,"A son in sorrow, and a wife at ease;"
10291,_THE BROTHERS._,"He takes no joy in office--see him now,"
10292,_THE BROTHERS._,And Burgess Steel has but a passing bow;
10293,_THE BROTHERS._,"Of one sad train of gloomy thoughts possess’d,      }"
10294,_THE BROTHERS._,"He takes no joy in friends, in food, in rest--      }"
10295,_THE BROTHERS._,"Dark are the evil days, and void of peace the best. }"
10296,_THE BROTHERS._,"And thus he lives, if living be to sigh,       }"
10297,_THE BROTHERS._,"And from all comforts of the world to fly,     }         410"
10298,_THE BROTHERS._,Without a hope in life--without a wish to die. }

10344,_THE LEARNED BOY._,By kind attention to his feeble boy.                      10
10345,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And--though a friendly widow knew no rest,"
10346,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Whilst neighbour Jones was lonely and distress’d,"
10347,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Nay, though the maidens spoke in tender tone"
10348,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Their hearts’ concern to see him left alone--
10349,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Jones still persisted in that cheerless life,"
10350,_THE LEARNED BOY._,As if t’were sin to take a second wife.
10351,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Oh! ’tis a precious thing, when wives are dead,"
10352,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To find such numbers who will serve instead;
10353,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And, in whatever state a man be thrown,"
10354,_THE LEARNED BOY._,’Tis that precisely they would wish their own.            20
10355,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Left the departed infants--then their joy
10356,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Is to sustain each lovely girl and boy;
10357,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Whatever calling his, whatever trade,"
10358,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To that their chief attention has been paid;
10359,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His happy taste in all things they approve,"
10360,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His friends they honour, and his food they love;"
10361,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His wish for order, prudence in affairs,"
10362,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And equal temper, (thank their stars!) are theirs;"
10363,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"In fact, it seem’d to be a thing decreed,"
10364,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And fix’d as fate, that marriage must succeed.            30"
10365,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Yet some, like Jones, with stubborn hearts and hard,"
10366,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Can hear such claims, and show them no regard."
10367,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Soon as our farmer, like a general, found"
10368,_THE LEARNED BOY._,By what strong foes he was encompass’d round--
10369,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Engage he dared not, and he could not fly,"
10370,_THE LEARNED BOY._,But saw his hope in gentle parley lie;
10371,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"With looks of kindness then, and trembling heart,"
10372,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He met the foe, and art opposed to art."
10373,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Now spoke that foe insidious--gentle tones,"
10374,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And gentle looks, assumed for Farmer Jones:               40"
10375,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Three girls,” the widow cried, “a lively three"
10376,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To govern well--indeed it cannot be.”
10377,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Yes,” he replied, “it calls for pains and care;"
10378,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But I must bear it.”--“Sir, you cannot bear;"
10379,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Your son is weak, and asks a mother’s eye.”--"
10380,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“That, my kind friend, a father’s may supply.”--"
10381,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Such growing griefs your very soul will tease.”--
10382,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“To grieve another would not give me ease;
10383,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"I have a mother.”--“She, poor ancient soul!"
10384,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Can she the spirits of the young control?                 50
10385,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Can she thy peace promote, partake thy care,"
10386,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Procure thy comforts, and thy sorrows share?"
10387,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Age is itself impatient, uncontroll’d.”--"
10388,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“But wives like mothers must at length be old.”--
10389,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Thou hast shrewd servants--they are evils sore.”--
10390,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Yet a shrewd mistress might afflict me more.”--
10391,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Wilt thou not be a weary wailing man?”--
10392,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Alas! and I must bear it as I can.”
10393,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Resisted thus, the widow soon withdrew,"
10394,_THE LEARNED BOY._,That in his pride the hero might pursue;                  60
10395,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And off his wonted guard, in some retreat,"
10396,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Find from a foe prepared entire defeat.
10397,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But he was prudent, for he knew in flight"
10398,_THE LEARNED BOY._,These Parthian warriors turn again and fight;
10399,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He but at freedom, not at glory aim’d,"
10400,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And only safety by his caution claim’d.
10401,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Thus, when a great and powerful state decrees"
10402,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Upon a small one, in its love, to seize--"
10403,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"It vows in kindness to protect, defend,"
10404,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And be the fond ally, the faithful friend;                70"
10405,_THE LEARNED BOY._,It therefore wills that humbler state to place
10406,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Its hopes of safety in a fond embrace:
10407,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Then must that humbler state its wisdom prove,"
10408,_THE LEARNED BOY._,By kind rejection of such pressing love;
10409,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Must dread such dangerous friendship to commence,"
10410,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And stand collected in its own defence.--
10411,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Our farmer thus the proffer’d kindness fled,"
10412,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And shunn’d the love that into bondage led.
10413,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The widow failing, fresh besiegers came,"
10414,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To share the fate of this retiring dame;                  80
10415,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And each foresaw a thousand ills attend
10416,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The man that fled from so discreet a friend;
10417,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And pray’d, kind soul! that no event might make"
10418,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The harden’d heart of Farmer Jones to ache.
10419,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But he still govern’d with resistless hand,"
10420,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And where he could not guide he would command.
10421,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"With steady view in course direct he steer’d,"
10422,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And his fair daughters loved him, though they fear’d;"
10423,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Each had her school, and, as his wealth was known,"
10424,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Each had in time a household of her own.                  90
10425,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The boy indeed was, at the grandam’s side,"
10426,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Humour’d and train’d, her trouble and her pride:"
10427,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Companions dear, with speech and spirits mild,"
10428,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The childish widow and the vapourish child.
10429,_THE LEARNED BOY._,This nature prompts; minds uninform’d and weak
10430,_THE LEARNED BOY._,In such alliance ease and comfort seek;
10431,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Push’d by the levity of youth aside,           }"
10432,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The cares of man, his humour, or his pride,    }"
10433,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They feel, in their defenceless state, allied. }"
10434,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The child is pleased to meet regard from age,            100"
10435,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The old are pleased ev’n children to engage;
10436,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And all their wisdom, scorn’d by proud mankind,"
10437,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They love to pour into the ductile mind,"
10438,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"By its own weakness into error led,"
10439,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And by fond age with prejudices fed.
10440,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The father, thankful for the good he had,"
10441,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Yet saw with pain a whining, timid lad;"
10442,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Whom he, instructing, led through cultured fields,"
10443,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To show what man performs, what nature yields;"
10444,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But Stephen, listless, wander’d from the view;    }      110"
10445,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"From beasts he fled, for butterflies he flew,     }"
10446,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And idly gazed about, in search of something new. }"
10447,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The lambs indeed he loved, and wish’d to play"
10448,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"With things so mild, so harmless, and so gay;"
10449,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Best pleased the weakest of the flock to see,"
10450,_THE LEARNED BOY._,With whom he felt a sickly sympathy.
10451,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Meantime, the dame was anxious, day and night,         }"
10452,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To guide the notions of her babe aright,                 }"
10453,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And on the favourite mind to throw her glimmering light; }
10454,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Her Bible-stories she impress’d betimes,                 120"
10455,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And fill’d his head with hymns and holy rhymes;
10456,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"On powers unseen, the good and ill, she dwelt,"
10457,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And the poor boy mysterious terrors felt;
10458,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"From frightful dreams, he, waking, sobb’d in dread,"
10459,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Till the good lady came to guard his bed.
10460,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The father wish’d such errors to correct,"
10461,_THE LEARNED BOY._,But let them pass in duty and respect.
10462,_THE LEARNED BOY._,But more it grieved his worthy mind to see
10463,_THE LEARNED BOY._,That Stephen never would a farmer be;
10464,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"In vain he tried the shiftless lad to guide,             130"
10465,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And yet ’twas time that something should be tried.
10466,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He at the village-school perchance might gain
10467,_THE LEARNED BOY._,All that such mind could gather and retain;
10468,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Yet the good dame affirm’d her favourite child
10469,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Was apt and studious, though sedate and mild;"
10470,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“That he on many a learned point could speak,"
10471,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And that his body, not his mind, was weak.”"
10472,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The father doubted--but to school was sent
10473,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The timid Stephen, weeping as he went:"
10474,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"There the rude lads compell’d the child to fight,        140"
10475,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And sent him bleeding to his home at night;
10476,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"At this the grandam more indulgent grew,"
10477,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And bade her darling “shun the beastly crew;
10478,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Whom Satan ruled, and who were sure to lie"
10479,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Howling in torments, when they came to die.”"
10480,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"This was such comfort, that in high disdain"
10481,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He told their fate, and felt their blows again."
10482,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Yet, if the boy had not a hero’s heart,"
10483,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Within the school he play’d a better part:
10484,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He wrote a clean, fine hand, and at his slate            150"
10485,_THE LEARNED BOY._,With more success than many a hero sate;
10486,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He thought not much indeed--but what depends
10487,_THE LEARNED BOY._,On pains and care was at his fingers’ ends.
10488,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"This had his father’s praise, who now espied"
10489,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"A spark of merit, with a blaze of pride;"
10490,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And, though a farmer he would never make,"
10491,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He might a pen with some advantage take;
10492,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And as a clerk that instrument employ,"
10493,_THE LEARNED BOY._,So well adapted to a timid boy.
10494,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"A London cousin soon a place obtain’d,                 160"
10495,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Easy but humble--little could be gain’d.
10496,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The time arrived when youth and age must part,"
10497,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Tears in each eye, and sorrow in each heart;"
10498,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The careful father bade his son attend
10499,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To all his duties, and obey his friend;"
10500,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To keep his church and there behave aright,   }"
10501,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"As one existing in his Maker’s sight,         }"
10502,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Till acts to habits led, and duty to delight: }"
10503,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Then try, my boy, as quickly as you can,"
10504,_THE LEARNED BOY._,T’ assume the looks and spirit of a man;                 170
10505,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"I say, be honest, faithful, civil, true,"
10506,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And this you may, and yet have courage too."
10507,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Heroic men, their country’s boast and pride,"
10508,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Have fear’d their God, and nothing fear’d beside;"
10509,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"While others daring, yet imbecile, fly"
10510,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The power of man, and that of God defy."
10511,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Be manly then, though mild, for, sure as fate,"
10512,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Thou art, my Stephen, too effeminate;"
10513,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Here, take my purse, and make a worthy use"
10514,_THE LEARNED BOY._,(’Tis fairly stock’d) of what it will produce;           180
10515,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And now my blessing, not as any charm"
10516,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Or conjuration; but ’twill do no harm.”
10517,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Stephen, whose thoughts were wandering up and down,"
10518,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Now charm’d with promised sights in London-town,"
10519,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Now loth to leave his grandam--lost the force,"
10520,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The drift and tenor of this grave discourse;
10521,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But, in a general way, he understood"
10522,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"’Twas good advice, and meant, “My son, be good;”"
10523,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And Stephen knew that all such precepts mean,"
10524,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"That lads should read their Bible, and be clean.         190"
10525,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The good old lady, though in some distress,"
10526,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Begg’d her dear Stephen would his grief suppress:
10527,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Nay, dry those eyes, my child--and, first of all,"
10528,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Hold fast thy faith, whatever may befall;"
10529,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Hear the best preacher, and preserve the text"
10530,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"For meditation, till you hear the next;"
10531,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Within your Bible night and morning look--
10532,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"There is your duty, read no other book;"
10533,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Be not in crowds, in broils, in riots seen,"
10534,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And keep your conscience and your linen clean.           200
10535,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Be you a Joseph, and the time may be,"
10536,_THE LEARNED BOY._,When kings and rulers will be ruled by thee.”
10537,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Nay,” said the father----“Hush, my son,” replied"
10538,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The dame----“The Scriptures must not be denied.”
10539,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The lad, still weeping, heard the wheels approach,"
10540,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And took his place within the evening coach,"
10541,_THE LEARNED BOY._,With heart quite rent asunder: On one side
10542,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Was love, and grief, and fear, for scenes untried;"
10543,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Wild beasts and wax-work fill’d the happier part
10544,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Of Stephen’s varying and divided heart;                  210
10545,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"This he betray’d by sighs and questions strange,"
10546,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Of famous shows, the Tower, and the Exchange."
10547,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Soon at his desk was placed the curious boy,"
10548,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Demure and silent at his new employ;
10549,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Yet, as he could, he much attention paid"
10550,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To all around him, cautious and afraid."
10551,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"On older clerks his eager eyes were fix’d,"
10552,_THE LEARNED BOY._,But Stephen never in their council mix’d;
10553,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Much their contempt he fear’d, for, if like them,"
10554,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He felt assured he should himself contemn:               220
10555,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Oh! they were all so eloquent, so free,"
10556,_THE LEARNED BOY._,No! he was nothing--nothing could he be.
10557,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They dress so smartly, and so boldly look,"
10558,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And talk as if they read it from a book;
10559,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But I,” said Stephen, “will forbear to speak,"
10560,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And they will think me prudent, and not weak."
10561,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They talk, the instant they have dropp’d the pen,"
10562,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Of singing-women and of acting-men;
10563,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Of plays and places where at night they walk
10564,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Beneath the lamps, and with the ladies talk;             230"
10565,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"While other ladies for their pleasure sing,"
10566,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Oh! ’tis a glorious and a happy thing.
10567,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They would despise me, did they understand"
10568,_THE LEARNED BOY._,I dare not look upon a scene so grand;
10569,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Or see the plays when critics rise and roar,"
10570,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And hiss and groan, and cry--‘Encore! encore!’--"
10571,_THE LEARNED BOY._,There’s one among them looks a little kind;
10572,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"If more encouraged, I would ope my mind.”"
10573,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Alas! poor Stephen, happier had he kept"
10574,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His purpose secret, while his envy slept;                240"
10575,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Virtue, perhaps, had conquer’d, or his shame"
10576,_THE LEARNED BOY._,At least preserved him simple as he came.
10577,_THE LEARNED BOY._,A year elapsed before this clerk began
10578,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To treat the rustic something like a man;
10579,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He then in trifling points the youth advised,"
10580,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Talk’d of his coat, and had it modernized;"
10581,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Or with the lad a Sunday-walk would take,"
10582,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And kindly strive his passions to awake;
10583,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Meanwhile explaining all they heard and saw,"
10584,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Till Stephen stood in wonderment and awe.                250
10585,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To a neat garden near the town they stray’d,"
10586,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Where the lad felt delighted and afraid;
10587,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"There all he saw was smart, and fine, and fair--"
10588,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He could but marvel how he ventured there:
10589,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Soon he observed, with terror and alarm,"
10590,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His friend enlock’d within a lady’s arm,"
10591,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And freely talking--“But it is,” said he,"
10592,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“A near relation, and that makes him free;”"
10593,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And much amazed was Stephen, when he knew"
10594,_THE LEARNED BOY._,This was the first and only interview;                   260
10595,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Nay, had that lovely arm by him been seized,"
10596,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The lovely owner had been highly pleased:
10597,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Alas!” he sigh’d, “I never can contrive,"
10598,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"At such bold, blessed freedoms to arrive;"
10599,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Never shall I such happy courage boast;
10600,_THE LEARNED BOY._,I dare as soon encounter with a ghost.”
10601,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Now to a play the friendly couple went,"
10602,_THE LEARNED BOY._,But the boy murmur’d at the money spent;
10603,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“He loved,” he said, “to buy, but not to spend--"
10604,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They only talk awhile, and there’s an end.”              270"
10605,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Come, you shall purchase books,” the friend replied;"
10606,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“You are bewilder’d, and you want a guide;"
10607,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To me refer the choice, and you shall find"
10608,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The light break in upon your stagnant mind!”
10609,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The cooler clerks exclaim’d, “In vain your art"
10610,_THE LEARNED BOY._,T’ improve a cub without a head or heart;
10611,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Rustics, though coarse, and savages, though wild,"
10612,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Our cares may render liberal and mild;
10613,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But what, my friend, can flow from all these pains?"
10614,_THE LEARNED BOY._,There is no dealing with a lack of brains.”--           280
10615,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“True I am hopeless to behold him man;
10616,_THE LEARNED BOY._,But let me make the booby what I can:
10617,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Though the rude stone no polish will display,"
10618,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Yet you may strip the rugged coat away.”
10619,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Stephen beheld his books--“I love to know
10620,_THE LEARNED BOY._,How money goes--now here is that to show;
10621,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And now,” he cried, “I shall be pleased to get"
10622,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Beyond the Bible--there I puzzle yet.”
10623,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He spoke abash’d--“Nay, nay!” the friend replied,"
10624,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“You need not lay the good old book aside;               290
10625,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Antique and curious, I myself indeed"
10626,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Read it at times, but as a man should read;"
10627,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"A fine old work it is, and I protest"
10628,_THE LEARNED BOY._,I hate to hear it treated as a jest;
10629,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The book has wisdom in it, if you look"
10630,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Wisely upon it, as another book;"
10631,_THE LEARNED BOY._,For superstition (as our priests of sin
10632,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Are pleased to tell us) makes us blind within.--
10633,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Of this hereafter--we will now select
10634,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Some works to please you, others to direct;              300"
10635,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Tales and romances shall your fancy feed,"
10636,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And reasoners form your morals and your creed.”
10637,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The books were view’d, the price was fairly paid,"
10638,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And Stephen read, undaunted, undismay’d--"
10639,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But not till first he paper’d all the row,"
10640,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And placed in order, to enjoy the show;"
10641,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Next letter’d all the backs with care and speed,"
10642,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Set them in ranks, and then began to read."
10643,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The love of order,--I the thing receive"
10644,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"From reverend men, and I in part believe--              310"
10645,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Shows a clear mind and clean, and whoso needs"
10646,_THE LEARNED BOY._,This love but seldom in the world succeeds;
10647,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And yet with this some other love must be,"
10648,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Ere I can fully to the fact agree.
10649,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Valour and study may by order gain,"
10650,_THE LEARNED BOY._,By order sovereigns hold more steady reign;
10651,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Through all the tribes of nature order runs,"
10652,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And rules around in systems and in suns;
10653,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Still has the love of order found a place       }
10654,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"With all that’s low, degrading, mean, and base, }       320"
10655,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"With all that merits scorn, and all that meets  }"
10656,_THE LEARNED BOY._,disgrace:                         }
10657,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"In the cold miser, of all change afraid;"
10658,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"In pompous men, in public seats obey’d;"
10659,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"In humble placemen, heralds, solemn drones,"
10660,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Fanciers of flowers, and lads like Stephen Jones;"
10661,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Order to these is armour and defence,"
10662,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And love of method serves in lack of sense.
10663,_THE LEARNED BOY._,For rustic youth could I a list produce
10664,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Of Stephen’s books, how great might be the use;"
10665,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But evil fate was theirs--survey’d, enjoy’d              330"
10666,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Some happy months, and then by force destroy’d."
10667,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"So will’d the fates--but these, with patience read,"
10668,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Had vast effect on Stephen’s heart and head.
10669,_THE LEARNED BOY._,This soon appear’d--within a single week
10670,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He oped his lips, and made attempt to speak;"
10671,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He fail’d indeed--but still his friend confess’d
10672,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The best have fail’d, and he had done his best."
10673,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The first of swimmers, when at first he swims,"
10674,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Has little use or freedom in his limbs;
10675,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Nay, when at length he strikes with manly force,         340"
10676,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The cramp may seize him, and impede his course."
10677,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Encouraged thus, our clerk again essay’d"
10678,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The daring act, though daunted and afraid;"
10679,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Succeeding now, though partial his success,"
10680,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And pertness mark’d his manner and address,"
10681,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Yet such improvement issued from his books,"
10682,_THE LEARNED BOY._,That all discern’d it in his speech and looks.
10683,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He ventured then on every theme to speak,"
10684,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And felt no feverish tingling in his cheek;
10685,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His friend, approving, hail’d the happy change;          350"
10686,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The clerks exclaim’d--“’Tis famous, and ’tis strange.”--"
10687,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Two years had pass’d; the youth attended still,"
10688,_THE LEARNED BOY._,(Though thus accomplish’d) with a ready quill;
10689,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He sat th’ allotted hours, though hard the case,"
10690,_THE LEARNED BOY._,While timid prudence ruled in virtue’s place;
10691,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"By promise bound, the son his letters penn’d"
10692,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To his good parent, at the quarter’s end."
10693,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"At first, he sent those lines, the state to tell"
10694,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Of his own health, and hoped his friends were well;"
10695,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He kept their virtuous precepts in his mind,             360"
10696,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And needed nothing--then his name was sign’d;
10697,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But now he wrote of Sunday walks and views,"
10698,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Of actors’ names, choice novels, and strange news;"
10699,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"How coats were cut, and of his urgent need"
10700,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"For fresh supply, which he desired with speed."
10701,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The father doubted, when these letters came,"
10702,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To what they tended, yet was loth to blame:"
10703,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Stephen was once _my duteous son_, and now"
10704,_THE LEARNED BOY._,_My most obedient_--this can I allow?
10705,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Can I with pleasure or with patience see                 370
10706,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"A boy at once so heartless, and so free?”"
10707,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But soon the kinsman heavy tidings told,"
10708,_THE LEARNED BOY._,That love and prudence could no more withhold:
10709,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Stephen, though steady at his desk, was grown"
10710,_THE LEARNED BOY._,A rake and coxcomb--this he grieved to own;
10711,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His cousin left his church, and spent the day"
10712,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Lounging about in quite a heathen way;
10713,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Sometimes he swore, but had indeed the grace"
10714,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To show the shame imprinted on his face.
10715,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"I search’d his room, and in his absence read             380"
10716,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Books that I knew would turn a stronger head:
10717,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The works of atheists half the number made,"
10718,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The rest were lives of harlots leaving trade;
10719,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Which neither man nor boy would deign to read,"
10720,_THE LEARNED BOY._,If from the scandal and pollution freed.
10721,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"I sometimes threaten’d, and would fairly state"
10722,_THE LEARNED BOY._,My sense of things so vile and profligate;
10723,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But I’m a cit, such works are lost on me--"
10724,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They’re knowledge, and (good Lord!) philosophy.”"
10725,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Oh, send him down,” the father soon replied;          390"
10726,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Let me behold him, and my skill be tried:"
10727,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"If care and kindness lose their wonted use,"
10728,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Some rougher medicine will the end produce.”
10729,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Stephen with grief and anger heard his doom--
10730,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Go to the farmer? to the rustic’s home?
10731,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Curse the base threat’ning--” “Nay, child, never curse;"
10732,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Corrupted long, your case is growing worse.”--"
10733,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“I!” quoth the youth, “I challenge all mankind"
10734,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To find a fault; what fault have you to find?
10735,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Improve I not in manner, speech, and grace?              400"
10736,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Inquire--my friends will tell it to your face;
10737,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Have I been taught to guard his kine and sheep?
10738,_THE LEARNED BOY._,A man like me has other things to keep;
10739,_THE LEARNED BOY._,This let him know.”--“It would his wrath excite;
10740,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But come, prepare, you must away to-night.”--"
10741,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“What! leave my studies, my improvements leave,"
10742,_THE LEARNED BOY._,My faithful friends and intimates to grieve!”--
10743,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Go to your father, Stephen, let him see"
10744,_THE LEARNED BOY._,All these improvements; they are lost on me.”
10745,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The youth, though loth, obey’d, and soon he saw        410"
10746,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The farmer-father, with some signs of awe:"
10747,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Who kind, yet silent, waited to behold"
10748,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"How one would act, so daring, yet so cold;"
10749,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And soon he found, between the friendly pair"
10750,_THE LEARNED BOY._,That secrets pass’d which he was not to share;
10751,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But he resolved those secrets to obtain,"
10752,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And quash rebellion in his lawful reign.
10753,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Stephen, though vain, was with his father mute;"
10754,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He fear’d a crisis, and he shunn’d dispute;"
10755,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And yet he long’d with youthful pride to show            420
10756,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He knew such things as farmers could not know;
10757,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"These to the grandam he with freedom spoke,"
10758,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Saw her amazement, and enjoy’d the joke."
10759,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"But, on the father when he cast his eye,"
10760,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Something he found that made his valour shy;
10761,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And thus there seem’d to be a hollow truce,"
10762,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Still threat’ning something dismal to produce.
10763,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Ere this the father at his leisure read
10764,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The son’s choice volumes, and his wonder fled;"
10765,_THE LEARNED BOY._,He saw how wrought the works of either kind              430
10766,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"On so presuming, yet so weak, a mind;"
10767,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"These in a chosen hour he made his prey,"
10768,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Condemn’d, and bore with vengeful thoughts away;"
10769,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Then in a close recess the couple near,"
10770,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"He sat unseen to see, unheard to hear."
10771,_THE LEARNED BOY._,There soon a trial for his patience came;
10772,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Beneath were placed the youth and ancient dame,"
10773,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Each on a purpose fix’d--but neither thought
10774,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"How near a foe, with power and vengeance fraught."
10775,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And now the matron told, as tidings sad,               440"
10776,_THE LEARNED BOY._,What she had heard of her beloved lad;
10777,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"How he to graceless, wicked men gave heed,"
10778,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And wicked books would night and morning read;
10779,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Some former lectures she again began,"
10780,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And begg’d attention of her little man;
10781,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"She brought, with many a pious boast, in view"
10782,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His former studies, and condemn’d the new:"
10783,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Once he the names of saints and patriarchs old,"
10784,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Judges and kings, and chiefs and prophets, told;"
10785,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Then he in winter-nights the Bible took,                 450"
10786,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To count how often in the sacred book
10787,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The sacred name appear’d, and could rehearse"
10788,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Which were the middle chapter, word, and verse,"
10789,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The very letter in the middle placed,"
10790,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And so employ’d the hours that others waste.
10791,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Such wert thou once; and now, my child, they say"
10792,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Thy faith like water runneth fast away;
10793,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The prince of devils hath, I fear, beguiled"
10794,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The ready wit of my backsliding child.”
10795,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"On this, with lofty looks, our clerk began             460"
10796,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"His grave rebuke, as he assumed the man--"
10797,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“There is no devil,” said the hopeful youth,"
10798,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Nor prince of devils; that I know for truth.
10799,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Have I not told you how my books describe
10800,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The arts of priests and all the canting tribe?
10801,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Your Bible mentions Egypt, where, it seems,"
10802,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Was Joseph found when Pharaoh dream’d his dreams.
10803,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Now, in that place, in some bewilder’d head,"
10804,_THE LEARNED BOY._,(The learned write) religious dreams were bred;
10805,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Whence through the earth, with various forms combined,"
10806,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"They came to frighten and afflict mankind,               471"
10807,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Prone (so I read) to let a priest invade        }
10808,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Their souls with awe, and by his craft be made  }"
10809,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Slave to his will, and profit to his trade.     }"
10810,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"So say my books, and how the rogues agreed"
10811,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To blind the victims, to defraud and lead;"
10812,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"When joys above to ready dupes were sold,"
10813,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And hell was threaten’d to the shy and cold.
10814,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Why so amazed, and so prepared to pray?"
10815,_THE LEARNED BOY._,As if a Being heard a word we say!                       480
10816,_THE LEARNED BOY._,This may surprise you; I myself began
10817,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"To feel disturb’d, and to my Bible ran;"
10818,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"I now am wiser--yet agree in this,"
10819,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The book has things that are not much amiss;
10820,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"It is a fine old work, and I protest"
10821,_THE LEARNED BOY._,I hate to hear it treated as a jest:
10822,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The book has wisdom in it, if you look"
10823,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Wisely upon it as another book.”--
10824,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Oh! wicked! wicked! my unhappy child,"
10825,_THE LEARNED BOY._,How hast thou been by evil men beguiled!”--             490
10826,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“How! wicked, say you? you can little guess"
10827,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The gain of that which you call wickedness:
10828,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Why, sins you think it sinful but to name"
10829,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Have gain’d both wives and widows wealth and fame;
10830,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And this, because such people never dread"
10831,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Those threaten’d pains; hell comes not in their head.
10832,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Love is our nature, wealth we all desire,"
10833,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And what we wish ’tis lawful to acquire;
10834,_THE LEARNED BOY._,So say my books--and what beside they show
10835,_THE LEARNED BOY._,’Tis time to let this honest farmer know.                500
10836,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Nay, look not grave; am I commanded down"
10837,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To feed his cattle and become his clown?
10838,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Is such his purpose? then he shall be told
10839,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The vulgar insult----”
10840,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"----“Hold, in mercy hold--”"
10841,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Father, oh! father! throw the whip away;"
10842,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"I was but jesting, on my knees I pray--"
10843,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"There, hold his arm--oh! leave us not alone;"
10844,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"In pity cease, and I will yet atone"
10845,_THE LEARNED BOY._,For all my sin--” In vain: stroke after stroke
10846,_THE LEARNED BOY._,On side and shoulder quick as mill-wheels broke;         510
10847,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Quick as the patient’s pulse, who trembling cried,"
10848,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And still the parent with a stroke replied;
10849,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Till all the medicine he prepared was dealt,"
10850,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And every bone the precious influence felt;
10851,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Till all the panting flesh was red and raw,"
10852,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And every thought was turn’d to fear and awe;
10853,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Till every doubt to due respect gave place--
10854,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Such cures are done when doctors know the case.
10855,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Oh! I shall die--my father! do receive
10856,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"My dying words; indeed, I do believe;                    520"
10857,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The books are lying books, I know it well,"
10858,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"There is a devil, oh! there is a hell;"
10859,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"And I’m a sinner: spare me, I am young,"
10860,_THE LEARNED BOY._,My sinful words were only on my tongue;
10861,_THE LEARNED BOY._,My heart consented not; ’tis all a lie:
10862,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Oh! spare me then, I’m not prepared to die.”"
10863,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Vain, worthless, stupid wretch!” the father cried,"
10864,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Dost thou presume to teach? art thou a guide?
10865,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Driveller and dog, it gave the mind distress"
10866,_THE LEARNED BOY._,To hear thy thoughts in their religious dress;           530
10867,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Thy pious folly moved my strong disdain,"
10868,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Yet I forgave thee for thy want of brain.
10869,_THE LEARNED BOY._,But Job in patience must the man exceed
10870,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Who could endure thee in thy present creed;
10871,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Is it for thee, thou idiot, to pretend"
10872,_THE LEARNED BOY._,The wicked cause a helping hand to lend?
10873,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Canst thou a judge in any question be?
10874,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Atheists themselves would scorn a friend like thee.--
10875,_THE LEARNED BOY._,“Lo! yonder blaze thy worthies; in one heap
10876,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Thy scoundrel-favourites must for ever sleep:            540
10877,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Each yields its poison to the flame in turn,"
10878,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Where whores and infidels are doom’d to burn;
10879,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Two noble faggots made the flame you see,"
10880,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Reserving only two fair twigs for thee;
10881,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"That in thy view the instruments may stand,"
10882,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And be in future ready for my hand:
10883,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"The just mementos that, though silent, show"
10884,_THE LEARNED BOY._,Whence thy correction and improvements flow;
10885,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Beholding these, thou wilt confess their power,"
10886,_THE LEARNED BOY._,And feel the shame of this important hour.               550
10887,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"“Hadst thou been humble, I had first design’d"
10888,_THE LEARNED BOY._,By care from folly to have freed thy mind;

10890,_THE LEARNED BOY._,"Our priest, more able, would have lent his aid."

10943,PREFACE.,"this kind, and more especially for these reasons: first, because a"
10944,PREFACE.,preface is a part of a book seldom honoured by a reader’s perusal;
10945,PREFACE.,"secondly, because it is both difficult and distressing to write that"
10946,PREFACE.,"which we think will be disregarded; and thirdly, because I do not"
10947,PREFACE.,conceive that I am called upon for such introductory matter by any of
10948,PREFACE.,the motives which usually influence an author when he composes his
10949,PREFACE.,prefatory address.
10950,PREFACE.,
10951,PREFACE.,"When a writer, whether of poetry or prose, first addresses the"
10952,PREFACE.,"public, he has generally something to offer which relates to himself"
10953,PREFACE.,"or to his work, and which he considers as a necessary prelude to the"
10954,PREFACE.,"work itself, to prepare his readers for the entertainment or the"
10955,PREFACE.,instruction they may expect to receive; for one of these every man
10956,PREFACE.,"who publishes must suppose he affords--this the act itself implies,"
10957,PREFACE.,and in proportion to his conviction of this fact must be his feeling
10958,PREFACE.,of the difficulty in which he has placed himself: the difficulty
10959,PREFACE.,"consists in reconciling the implied presumption of the undertaking,"
10960,PREFACE.,"whether to please or to instruct mankind, with the diffidence and"
10961,PREFACE.,modesty of an untried candidate for fame or favour. Hence originate
10962,PREFACE.,the many reasons an author assigns for his appearance in that
10963,PREFACE.,"character, whether they actually exist, or are merely offered to hide"
10964,PREFACE.,"the motives which cannot be openly avowed: namely, the want or the"
10965,PREFACE.,"vanity of the man, as his wishes for profit or reputation may most"
10966,PREFACE.,prevail with him.
10967,PREFACE.,
10968,PREFACE.,"Now, reasons of this kind, whatever they may be, cannot be availing"
10969,PREFACE.,"beyond their first appearance. An author, it is true, may again feel"
10970,PREFACE.,"his former apprehensions, may again be elevated or depressed by"
10971,PREFACE.,"the suggestions of vanity and diffidence, and may be again subject"
10972,PREFACE.,to the cold and hot fit of aguish expectation; but he is no more a
10973,PREFACE.,"stranger to the press, nor has the motives or privileges of one who"
10974,PREFACE.,"is. With respect to myself, it is certain they belong not to me. Many"
10975,PREFACE.,years have elapsed since I became a candidate for indulgence as an
10976,PREFACE.,"inexperienced writer; and to assume the language of such writer now,"
10977,PREFACE.,"and to plead for his indulgences, would be proof of my ignorance"
10978,PREFACE.,"of the place assigned to me, and the degree of favour which I have"
10979,PREFACE.,"experienced; but of that place I am not uninformed, and with that"
10980,PREFACE.,degree of favour I have no reason to be dissatisfied.
10981,PREFACE.,
10982,PREFACE.,"It was the remark of the pious, but on some occasions the querulous,"
10983,PREFACE.,"author of the _Night Thoughts_, that he had “been so long remembered,"
10984,PREFACE.,he was forgotten”--an expression in which there is more appearance
10985,PREFACE.,"of discontent than of submission: if he had patience, it was not the"
10986,PREFACE.,patience that _smiles at grief_. It is not therefore entirely in the
10987,PREFACE.,"sense of the good Doctor that I apply these words to myself, or to my"
10988,PREFACE.,more early publications. So many years indeed have passed since their
10989,PREFACE.,"first appearance, that I have no reason to complain, on that account,"
10990,PREFACE.,if they be now slumbering with other poems of decent reputation in
10991,PREFACE.,"their day--not dead indeed, nor entirely forgotten, but certainly not"
10992,PREFACE.,the subjects of discussion or conversation as when first introduced
10993,PREFACE.,"to the notice of the public by those whom the public will not forget,"
10994,PREFACE.,"whose protection was credit to their author, and whose approbation"
10995,PREFACE.,was fame to them. Still these early publications had so long preceded
10996,PREFACE.,"any other, that, if not altogether unknown, I was, when I came again"
10997,PREFACE.,"before the public, in a situation which excused, and perhaps rendered"
10998,PREFACE.,"necessary, some explanation; but this also has passed away, and none"
10999,PREFACE.,of my readers will now take the trouble of making any inquiries
11000,PREFACE.,respecting my motives for writing or for publishing these Tales or
11001,PREFACE.,verses of any description. Known to each other as readers and authors
11002,PREFACE.,"are known, they will require no preface to bespeak their good will;"
11003,PREFACE.,nor shall I be under the necessity of soliciting the kindness which
11004,PREFACE.,"experience has taught me, endeavouring to merit, I shall not fail to"
11005,PREFACE.,receive.
11006,PREFACE.,
11007,PREFACE.,There is one motive--and it is a powerful one--which sometimes
11008,PREFACE.,"induces an author, and more particularly a poet, to ask the attention"
11009,PREFACE.,of his readers to his prefatory address. This is when he has some
11010,PREFACE.,favourite and peculiar style or manner which he would explain and
11011,PREFACE.,"defend, and chiefly if he should have adopted a mode of versification"
11012,PREFACE.,of which an uninitiated reader was not likely to perceive either
11013,PREFACE.,"the merit or the beauty. In such case it is natural, and surely"
11014,PREFACE.,"pardonable, to assert and to prove, as far as reason will bear"
11015,PREFACE.,"us on, that such method of writing has both; to show in what the"
11016,PREFACE.,"beauty consists, and what peculiar difficulty there is, which, when"
11017,PREFACE.,"conquered, creates the merit. How far any particular poet has or has"
11018,PREFACE.,not succeeded in such attempt is not my business nor my purpose to
11019,PREFACE.,"inquire: I have no peculiar notion to defend, no poetical heterodoxy"
11020,PREFACE.,"to support, nor theory of any kind to vindicate or oppose--that which"
11021,PREFACE.,I have used is probably the most common measure in our language; and
11022,PREFACE.,"therefore, whatever be its advantages or defects, they are too well"
11023,PREFACE.,"known to require from me a description of the one, or an apology for"
11024,PREFACE.,the other.
11025,PREFACE.,
11026,PREFACE.,Perhaps still more frequent than any explanation of the work is an
11027,PREFACE.,"account of the author himself, the situation in which he is placed,"
11028,PREFACE.,"or some circumstances of peculiar kind in his life, education, or"
11029,PREFACE.,employment. How often has youth been pleaded for deficiencies or
11030,PREFACE.,"redundancies, for the existence of which youth may be an excuse,"
11031,PREFACE.,and yet be none for their exposure. Age too has been pleaded for
11032,PREFACE.,the errors and failings in a work which the octogenarian had
11033,PREFACE.,"the discernment to perceive, and yet had not the fortitude to"
11034,PREFACE.,suppress. Many other circumstances are made apologies for a writer’s
11035,PREFACE.,"infirmities: his much employment, and many avocations, adversity,"
11036,PREFACE.,"necessity, and the good of mankind. These, or any of them, however"
11037,PREFACE.,"availing in themselves, avail not me. I am neither so young nor so"
11038,PREFACE.,"old, so much engaged by one pursuit, or by many--I am not so urged"
11039,PREFACE.,"by want, or so stimulated by a desire of public benefit--that I can"
11040,PREFACE.,borrow one apology from the many which I have named. How far they
11041,PREFACE.,"prevail with our readers, or with our judges, I cannot tell; and it"
11042,PREFACE.,is unnecessary for me to inquire into the validity of arguments which
11043,PREFACE.,I have not to produce.
11044,PREFACE.,
11045,PREFACE.,If there be any combination of circumstances which may be supposed
11046,PREFACE.,"to affect the mind of a reader, and in some degree to influence his"
11047,PREFACE.,"judgment, the junction of youth, beauty, and merit in a female writer"
11048,PREFACE.,may be allowed to do this; and yet one of the most forbidding of
11049,PREFACE.,"titles is “Poems by a very young Lady”--and this, although beauty"
11050,PREFACE.,"and merit were largely insinuated. Ladies, it is true, have of late"
11051,PREFACE.,"little need of any indulgence as authors, and names may readily be"
11052,PREFACE.,found which rather excite the envy of man than plead for his lenity.
11053,PREFACE.,Our estimation of title also in a writer has materially varied from
11054,PREFACE.,that of our predecessors; “Poems by a Nobleman” would create a very
11055,PREFACE.,different sensation in our minds from that which was formerly excited
11056,PREFACE.,when they were so announced. A noble author had then no pretensions
11057,PREFACE.,"to a seat so secure on the “sacred hill,” that authors not noble,"
11058,PREFACE.,"and critics not gentle, dared not attack; and they delighted to take"
11059,PREFACE.,"revenge, by their contempt and derision of the poet, for the pain"
11060,PREFACE.,which their submission and respect to the man had cost them. But
11061,PREFACE.,"in our times we find that a nobleman writes, not merely as well,"
11062,PREFACE.,but better than other men: insomuch that readers in general begin
11063,PREFACE.,to fancy that the Muses have relinquished their old partiality for
11064,PREFACE.,"rags and a garret, and are become altogether aristocratical in"
11065,PREFACE.,their choice. A conceit so well supported by fact would be readily
11066,PREFACE.,"admitted, did it not appear at the same time, that there were in"
11067,PREFACE.,"the higher ranks of society men who could write as tamely, or as"
11068,PREFACE.,"absurdly, as they had ever been accused of doing. We may, therefore,"
11069,PREFACE.,"regard the works of any noble author as extraordinary productions,"
11070,PREFACE.,"but must not found any theory upon them; and, notwithstanding their"
11071,PREFACE.,"appearance, must look on genius and talent as we are wont to do on"
11072,PREFACE.,"time and chance, that happen indifferently to all mankind."
11073,PREFACE.,
11074,PREFACE.,"But, whatever influence any peculiar situation of a writer might"
11075,PREFACE.,"have, it cannot be a benefit to me, who have no such peculiarity."
11076,PREFACE.,I must rely upon the willingness of my readers to be pleased
11077,PREFACE.,"with that which was designed to give them pleasure, and upon the"
11078,PREFACE.,cordiality which naturally springs from a remembrance of our having
11079,PREFACE.,"before parted without any feelings of disgust on the one side, or of"
11080,PREFACE.,mortification on the other.
11081,PREFACE.,
11082,PREFACE.,With this hope I would conclude the present subject; but I am called
11083,PREFACE.,"upon by duty to acknowledge my obligations, and more especially"
11084,PREFACE.,"for two of the following Tales--the Story of Lady Barbara, in Book"
11085,PREFACE.,XVI; and that of Ellen in Book XVIII. The first of these I owe to
11086,PREFACE.,"the kindness of a fair friend, who will, I hope, accept the thanks"
11087,PREFACE.,"which I very gratefully pay, and pardon me if I have not given to"
11088,PREFACE.,her relation the advantages which she had so much reason to expect.
11089,PREFACE.,"The other story, that of Ellen, could I give it in the language of"
11090,PREFACE.,"him who related it to me, would please and affect my readers. It is"
11091,PREFACE.,"by no means my only debt, though the one I now more particularly"
11092,PREFACE.,"acknowledge; for who shall describe all that he gains in the social,"
11093,PREFACE.,"the unrestrained, and the frequent conversations with a friend,"
11094,PREFACE.,"who is at once communicative and judicious--whose opinions, on all"
11095,PREFACE.,"subjects of literary kind, are founded on good taste, and exquisite"
11096,PREFACE.,feeling? It is one of the greatest “pleasures of my memory” to
11097,PREFACE.,"recal in absence those conversations; and, if I do not in direct"
11098,PREFACE.,"terms mention with whom I conversed, it is both because I have no"
11099,PREFACE.,"permission, and my readers will have no doubt."
11100,PREFACE.,
11101,PREFACE.,"The first intention of the poet must be to please; for, if he means"
11102,PREFACE.,"to instruct, he must render the instruction which he hopes to convey"
11103,PREFACE.,"palatable and pleasant. I will not assume the tone of a moralist,"
11104,PREFACE.,nor promise that my relations shall be beneficial to mankind; but I
11105,PREFACE.,"have endeavoured, not unsuccessfully I trust, that, in whatsoever I"
11106,PREFACE.,"have related or described, there should be nothing introduced which"
11107,PREFACE.,has a tendency to excuse the vices of man by associating with them
11108,PREFACE.,"sentiments that demand our respect, and talents that compel our"
11109,PREFACE.,admiration. There is nothing in these pages which has the mischievous
11110,PREFACE.,"effect of confounding truth and error, or confusing our ideas of"
11111,PREFACE.,right and wrong. I know not which is most injurious to the yielding
11112,PREFACE.,minds of the young--to render virtue less respectable by making
11113,PREFACE.,"its possessors ridiculous, or by describing vice with so many"
11114,PREFACE.,"fascinating qualities, that it is either lost in the assemblage, or"
11115,PREFACE.,pardoned by the association. Man’s heart is sufficiently prone to
11116,PREFACE.,"make excuse for man’s infirmity, and needs not the aid of poetry, or"
11117,PREFACE.,"eloquence, to take from vice its native deformity. A character may be"
11118,PREFACE.,"respectable with all its faults, but it must not be made respectable"
11119,PREFACE.,by them. It is grievous when genius will condescend to place strong
11120,PREFACE.,"and evil spirits in a commanding view, or excite our pity and"
11121,PREFACE.,"admiration for men of talents, degraded by crime, when struggling"
11122,PREFACE.,with misfortune. It is but too true that great and wicked men may be
11123,PREFACE.,"so presented to us as to demand our applause, when they should excite"
11124,PREFACE.,"our abhorrence; but it is surely for the interest of mankind, and"
11125,PREFACE.,"our own self-direction, that we should ever keep at unapproachable"
11126,PREFACE.,distance our respect and our reproach.
11127,PREFACE.,
11128,PREFACE.,I have one observation more to offer. It may appear to some that a
11129,PREFACE.,"minister of religion, in the decline of life, should have no leisure"
11130,PREFACE.,for such amusements as these; and for them I have no reply. But to
11131,PREFACE.,"those who are more indulgent to the propensities, the studies, and"
11132,PREFACE.,"the habits of mankind, I offer some apology when I produce these"
11133,PREFACE.,"volumes, not as the occupations of my life, but the fruits of my"
11134,PREFACE.,"leisure--the employment of that time which, if not given to them, had"
11135,PREFACE.,"passed in the vacuity of unrecorded idleness, or had been lost in the"
11136,PREFACE.,"indulgence of unregistered thoughts and fancies, that melt away in"
11137,PREFACE.,"the instant they are conceived, and “_leave not a wreck behind_.”"

11279,_THE HALL._,"Be they of pain or pleasure, we disclose,"
11280,_THE HALL._,"It is of custom, doubtless is of use,"
11281,_THE HALL._,That we our heroes first should introduce.               120
11282,_THE HALL._,"Come, then, fair Truth! and let me clearly see"
11283,_THE HALL._,"The minds I paint, as they are seen in thee;"
11284,_THE HALL._,To me their merits and their faults impart;    }
11285,_THE HALL._,"Give me to say, “frail being! such thou art,”  }"
11286,_THE HALL._,And closely let me view the naked human heart. }
11287,_THE HALL._,"GEORGE loved to think; but, as he late began"
11288,_THE HALL._,"To muse on all the grander thoughts of man,"
11289,_THE HALL._,He took a solemn and a serious view
11290,_THE HALL._,"Of his religion, and he found it true;"
11291,_THE HALL._,"Firmly, yet meekly, he his mind applied                  130"
11292,_THE HALL._,"To this great subject, and was satisfied."
11293,_THE HALL._,"He then proceeded, not so much intent,"
11294,_THE HALL._,"But still in earnest, and to church he went."
11295,_THE HALL._,"Although they found some difference in their creed,"
11296,_THE HALL._,"He and his pastor cordially agreed,"
11297,_THE HALL._,Convinced that they who would the truth obtain
11298,_THE HALL._,"By disputation, find their efforts vain;"
11299,_THE HALL._,"The church he view’d as liberal minds will view,"
11300,_THE HALL._,And there he fix’d his principles and pew.
11301,_THE HALL._,"He saw--he thought he saw--how weakness, pride,        140"
11302,_THE HALL._,"And habit, draw seceding crowds aside:"
11303,_THE HALL._,"Weakness, that loves on trifling points to dwell;"
11304,_THE HALL._,"Pride, that at first from Heaven’s own worship fell;"
11305,_THE HALL._,"And habit, going where it went before,"
11306,_THE HALL._,Or to the meeting or the tavern door.
11307,_THE HALL._,"George loved the cause of freedom, but reproved"
11308,_THE HALL._,All who with wild and boyish ardour loved:
11309,_THE HALL._,"Those who believed they never could be free,"
11310,_THE HALL._,Except when fighting for their liberty;
11311,_THE HALL._,Who by their very clamour and complaint                  150
11312,_THE HALL._,Invite coercion or enforce restraint.
11313,_THE HALL._,"He thought a trust so great, so good a cause,"
11314,_THE HALL._,Was only to be kept by guarding laws;
11315,_THE HALL._,"For, public blessings firmly to secure,"
11316,_THE HALL._,We must a lessening of the good endure.
11317,_THE HALL._,The public waters are to none denied;
11318,_THE HALL._,"All drink the stream, but only few must guide."
11319,_THE HALL._,"There must be reservoirs to hold supply,"
11320,_THE HALL._,And channels form’d to send the blessing by;
11321,_THE HALL._,The public good must be a private care;                  160
11322,_THE HALL._,"None all they would may have, but all a share."
11323,_THE HALL._,So we must freedom with restraint enjoy;
11324,_THE HALL._,"What crowds possess they will, uncheck’d, destroy;"
11325,_THE HALL._,"And hence, that freedom may to all be dealt,"
11326,_THE HALL._,"Guards must be fix’d, and safety must be felt."
11327,_THE HALL._,"So thought our squire, nor wish’d the guards t’ appear"
11328,_THE HALL._,"So strong, that safety might be bought too dear;"
11329,_THE HALL._,The constitution was the ark that he
11330,_THE HALL._,Join’d to support with zeal and sanctity;
11331,_THE HALL._,"Nor would expose it, as th’ accursed son                 170"
11332,_THE HALL._,"His father’s weakness, to be gazed upon."
11333,_THE HALL._,"“I for that freedom make,” said he, “my prayer,"
11334,_THE HALL._,"That suits with all, like atmospheric air;"
11335,_THE HALL._,"That is to mortal man by heaven assign’d,"
11336,_THE HALL._,Who cannot bear a pure and perfect kind.
11337,_THE HALL._,"The lighter gas, that, taken in the frame,"
11338,_THE HALL._,"The spirit heats, and sets the blood in flame:"
11339,_THE HALL._,"Such is the freedom which when men approve,"
11340,_THE HALL._,They know not what a dangerous thing they love.”
11341,_THE HALL._,"George chose the company of men of sense,              180"
11342,_THE HALL._,But could with wit in moderate share dispense;
11343,_THE HALL._,"He wish’d in social ease his friends to meet,"
11344,_THE HALL._,When still he thought the female accent sweet;
11345,_THE HALL._,"Well from the ancient, better from the young,"
11346,_THE HALL._,He loved the lispings of the mother tongue.
11347,_THE HALL._,"He ate and drank, as much as men who think"
11348,_THE HALL._,"Of life’s best pleasures, ought to eat or drink;"
11349,_THE HALL._,"Men purely temperate might have taken less,"
11350,_THE HALL._,"But still he loved indulgence, not excess;"
11351,_THE HALL._,"Nor would alone the grants of fortune taste,             190"
11352,_THE HALL._,But shared the wealth he judged it crime to waste;
11353,_THE HALL._,And thus obtained the sure reward of care--
11354,_THE HALL._,For none can spend like him who learns to spare.
11355,_THE HALL._,"Time, thought, and trouble made the man appear--"
11356,_THE HALL._,By nature shrewd--sarcastic and severe;
11357,_THE HALL._,"Still, he was one whom those who fully knew"
11358,_THE HALL._,"Esteem’d and trusted, one correct and true;"
11359,_THE HALL._,"All on his word with surety might depend,"
11360,_THE HALL._,"Kind as a man, and faithful as a friend."
11361,_THE HALL._,"But him the many [knew] not, knew not cause              200"
11362,_THE HALL._,In their new squire for censure or applause;
11363,_THE HALL._,"Ask them, “Who dwelt within that lofty wall?”"
11364,_THE HALL._,"And they would say, “the gentleman was tall;"
11365,_THE HALL._,"Look’d old when follow’d, but alert when met,"
11366,_THE HALL._,And had some vigour in his movements yet;
11367,_THE HALL._,"He stoops, but not as one infirm; and wears"
11368,_THE HALL._,Dress that becomes his station and his years.”
11369,_THE HALL._,Such was the man who from the world return’d
11370,_THE HALL._,"Nor friend nor foe; he prized it not, nor spurn’d;"
11371,_THE HALL._,"But came and sat him in his village down,                210"
11372,_THE HALL._,"Safe from its smile, and careless of its frown:"
11373,_THE HALL._,"He, fairly looking into life’s account,"
11374,_THE HALL._,Saw frowns and favours were of like amount;
11375,_THE HALL._,"And viewing all--his perils, prospects, purse--"
11376,_THE HALL._,"He said, “Content! ’tis well it is no worse.”"
11377,_THE HALL._,"Through ways more rough had fortune RICHARD led,"
11378,_THE HALL._,The world he traversed was the book he read;
11379,_THE HALL._,Hence clashing notions and opinions strange
11380,_THE HALL._,Lodged in his mind: all liable to change.
11381,_THE HALL._,"By nature generous, open, daring, free,                220"
11382,_THE HALL._,The vice he hated was hypocrisy.
11383,_THE HALL._,"Religious notions, in her latter years,"
11384,_THE HALL._,"His mother gave, admonish’d by her fears;"
11385,_THE HALL._,"To these he added, as he chanced to read"
11386,_THE HALL._,A pious work or learn a christian creed.
11387,_THE HALL._,"He heard the preacher by the highway side,"
11388,_THE HALL._,"The church’s teacher, and the meeting’s guide;"
11389,_THE HALL._,"And, mixing all their matters in his brain,"
11390,_THE HALL._,Distill’d a something he could ill explain;
11391,_THE HALL._,"But still it served him for his daily use,               230"
11392,_THE HALL._,And kept his lively passions from abuse;
11393,_THE HALL._,"For he believed, and held in reverence high,"
11394,_THE HALL._,The truth so dear to man--“not all shall die.”
11395,_THE HALL._,"The minor portions of his creed hung loose,"
11396,_THE HALL._,For time to shapen and an whole produce;
11397,_THE HALL._,"This love effected, and a favourite maid"
11398,_THE HALL._,With clearer views his honest flame repaid;
11399,_THE HALL._,"Hers was the thought correct, the hope sublime,"
11400,_THE HALL._,"She shaped his creed, and did the work of time."
11401,_THE HALL._,"He spake of freedom as a nation’s cause,               240"
11402,_THE HALL._,"And loved, like George, our liberty and laws;"
11403,_THE HALL._,"But had more youthful ardour to be free,"
11404,_THE HALL._,And stronger fears for injured liberty.
11405,_THE HALL._,"With him, on various questions that arose,"
11406,_THE HALL._,The monarch’s servants were the people’s foes;
11407,_THE HALL._,"And, though he fought with all a Briton’s zeal,"
11408,_THE HALL._,He felt for France as Freedom’s children feel;
11409,_THE HALL._,"Went far with her in what she thought reform,"
11410,_THE HALL._,And hail’d the revolutionary storm;
11411,_THE HALL._,"Yet would not here, where there was least to win,        250"
11412,_THE HALL._,"And most to lose, the doubtful work begin;"
11413,_THE HALL._,"But look’d on change with some religious fear,"
11414,_THE HALL._,"And cried, with filial dread, “Ah! come not here.”"
11415,_THE HALL._,His friends he did not as the thoughtful choose;
11416,_THE HALL._,"Long to deliberate was, he judged, to lose;"
11417,_THE HALL._,"Frankly he join’d the free, nor suffered pride"
11418,_THE HALL._,"Or doubt to part them, whom their fate allied;"
11419,_THE HALL._,Men with such minds at once each other aid;       }
11420,_THE HALL._,"“Frankness,” they cry, “with frankness is repaid; }"
11421,_THE HALL._,"If honest, why suspect? if poor, of what afraid?  }     260"
11422,_THE HALL._,Wealth’s timid votaries may with caution move;
11423,_THE HALL._,Be it our wisdom to confide and love.”
11424,_THE HALL._,"So pleasures came, (not purchased first or plann’d)"
11425,_THE HALL._,But the chance pleasures that the poor command;
11426,_THE HALL._,"They came but seldom, they remain’d not long,"
11427,_THE HALL._,Nor gave him time to question “are they wrong?”
11428,_THE HALL._,"These he enjoy’d, and left to after time"
11429,_THE HALL._,To judge the folly or decide the crime;
11430,_THE HALL._,"Sure had he been, he had perhaps been pure"
11431,_THE HALL._,From this reproach--but Richard was not sure--          270
11432,_THE HALL._,"Yet from the sordid vice, the mean, the base,"
11433,_THE HALL._,He stood aloof--death frown’d not like disgrace.
11434,_THE HALL._,"With handsome figure, and with manly air,"
11435,_THE HALL._,"He pleased the sex, who all to him were fair;"
11436,_THE HALL._,"With filial love he look’d on forms decay’d,"
11437,_THE HALL._,And admiration’s debt to beauty paid;
11438,_THE HALL._,"On sea or land, wherever Richard went,"
11439,_THE HALL._,"He felt affection, and he found content;"
11440,_THE HALL._,There was in him a strong presiding hope
11441,_THE HALL._,"In fortune’s tempests, and it bore him up.               280"
11442,_THE HALL._,"But when that mystic vine his mansion graced,"
11443,_THE HALL._,"When numerous branches round his board were placed,"
11444,_THE HALL._,When sighs of apprehensive love were heard--
11445,_THE HALL._,Then first the spirit of the hero fear’d;
11446,_THE HALL._,"Then he reflected on the father’s part,"
11447,_THE HALL._,And all an husband’s sorrow touch’d his heart;
11448,_THE HALL._,"Then thought he, “Who will their assistance lend?"
11449,_THE HALL._,"And be the children’s guide, the parent’s friend?"
11450,_THE HALL._,"Who shall their guardian, their protector be?"
11451,_THE HALL._,I have a brother--Well!--and so has he.”                 290
11452,_THE HALL._,"And now they met; a message--kind, ’tis true,"
11453,_THE HALL._,But verbal only--ask’d an interview;
11454,_THE HALL._,"And many a mile, perplex’d by doubt and fear,"
11455,_THE HALL._,"Had Richard past, unwilling to appear--"
11456,_THE HALL._,"“How shall I now my unknown way explore,"
11457,_THE HALL._,He proud and rich--I very proud and poor?
11458,_THE HALL._,"Perhaps my friend a dubious speech mistook,"
11459,_THE HALL._,And George may meet me with a stranger’s look;
11460,_THE HALL._,"Then to my home when I return again,                 }"
11461,_THE HALL._,"How shall I bear this business to explain,           }   300"
11462,_THE HALL._,"And tell of hopes raised high, and feelings hurt, in }"
11463,_THE HALL._,vain?                                 }
11464,_THE HALL._,“How stands the case? My brother’s friend and mine
11465,_THE HALL._,"Met at an inn, and sat them down to dine:"
11466,_THE HALL._,"When, having settled all their own affairs,"
11467,_THE HALL._,"And kindly canvass’d such as were not theirs,"
11468,_THE HALL._,Just as my friend was going to retire--
11469,_THE HALL._,"‘Stay!--you will see the brother of our squire,’"
11470,_THE HALL._,"Said his companion; ‘be his friend, and tell"
11471,_THE HALL._,"The captain that his brother loves him well,"
11472,_THE HALL._,"And, when he has no better thing in view,                310"
11473,_THE HALL._,"Will be rejoiced to see him. Now, adieu!’"
11474,_THE HALL._,"Well! here I am; and, brother, take you heed,"
11475,_THE HALL._,I am not come to flatter you and feed;
11476,_THE HALL._,"You shall no soother, fawner, hearer find,"
11477,_THE HALL._,"I will not brush your coat, nor smooth your mind;"
11478,_THE HALL._,"I will not hear your tales the whole day long,"
11479,_THE HALL._,Nor swear you’re right if I believe you wrong.
11480,_THE HALL._,"Nor be a witness of the facts you state,"
11481,_THE HALL._,Nor as my own adopt your love or hate:
11482,_THE HALL._,"I will not earn my dinner when I dine,                   320"
11483,_THE HALL._,By taking all your sentiments for mine;
11484,_THE HALL._,"Nor watch the guiding motions of your eye,"
11485,_THE HALL._,Before I venture question or reply;
11486,_THE HALL._,"Nor when you speak affect an awe profound,"
11487,_THE HALL._,"Sinking my voice, as if I fear’d the sound;"
11488,_THE HALL._,"Nor to your looks obediently attend,"
11489,_THE HALL._,"The poor, the humble, the dependant friend;"
11490,_THE HALL._,"Yet, son of that dear mother could I meet--"
11491,_THE HALL._,But lo! the mansion--’tis a fine old seat!”
11492,_THE HALL._,"The Brothers met, with both too much at heart          330"
11493,_THE HALL._,To be observant of each other’s part.
11494,_THE HALL._,"“Brother, I’m glad,” was all that George could say,"
11495,_THE HALL._,"Then stretch’d his hand, and turn’d his head away;"
11496,_THE HALL._,"For he in tender tears had no delight,"
11497,_THE HALL._,"But scorn’d the thought, and ridiculed the sight;"
11498,_THE HALL._,"Yet now with pleasure, though with some surprise,"
11499,_THE HALL._,He felt his heart o’erflowing at his eyes.
11500,_THE HALL._,"Richard, mean time, made some attempts to speak,"
11501,_THE HALL._,"Strong in his purpose, in his trial weak;"
11502,_THE HALL._,"We cannot nature by our wishes rule,                     340"
11503,_THE HALL._,Nor at our will her warm emotions cool;--
11504,_THE HALL._,"At length affection, like a risen tide,"
11505,_THE HALL._,"Stood still, and then seem’d slowly to subside;"
11506,_THE HALL._,"Each on the other’s looks had power to dwell,"
11507,_THE HALL._,And Brother Brother greeted passing well.

11529,_THE BROTHERS._,
11530,_THE BROTHERS._,"At length the Brothers met, no longer tried"
11531,_THE BROTHERS._,By those strong feelings that in time subside;
11532,_THE BROTHERS._,"Not fluent yet their language, but the eye"
11533,_THE BROTHERS._,And action spoke both question and reply;
11534,_THE BROTHERS._,"Till the heart rested, and could calmly feel;"
11535,_THE BROTHERS._,Till the shook compass felt the settling steel;
11536,_THE BROTHERS._,"Till playful smiles on graver converse broke,"
11537,_THE BROTHERS._,And either speaker less abruptly spoke.
11538,_THE BROTHERS._,"Still was there oft-times silence, silence blest,"
11539,_THE BROTHERS._,"Expressive, thoughtful--their emotions’ rest:             10"
11540,_THE BROTHERS._,"Pauses that came not from a want of thought,"
11541,_THE BROTHERS._,"But want of ease, by wearied passion sought;"
11542,_THE BROTHERS._,"For souls, when hurried by such powerful force,"
11543,_THE BROTHERS._,"Rest, and retrace the pleasure of the course."
11544,_THE BROTHERS._,They differ’d much; yet might observers trace
11545,_THE BROTHERS._,Likeness of features both in mind and face;
11546,_THE BROTHERS._,"Pride they possess’d, that neither strove to hide,"
11547,_THE BROTHERS._,"But not offensive, not obtrusive pride."
11548,_THE BROTHERS._,"Unlike had been their life, unlike the fruits"
11549,_THE BROTHERS._,"Of different tempers, studies, and pursuits;              20"
11550,_THE BROTHERS._,"Nay, in such varying scenes the men had moved,"
11551,_THE BROTHERS._,’Twas passing strange that aught alike they loved.
11552,_THE BROTHERS._,"But all distinction now was thrown apart,"
11553,_THE BROTHERS._,While these strong feelings ruled in either heart.
11554,_THE BROTHERS._,"As various colours in a painted ball,"
11555,_THE BROTHERS._,"While it has rest, are seen distinctly all,"
11556,_THE BROTHERS._,"Till, whirl’d around by some exterior force,"
11557,_THE BROTHERS._,They all are blended in the rapid course:
11558,_THE BROTHERS._,"So in repose, and not by passion sway’d,"
11559,_THE BROTHERS._,We saw the difference by their habits made;               30
11560,_THE BROTHERS._,"But, tried by strong emotions, they became"
11561,_THE BROTHERS._,"Fill’d with one love, and were in heart the same;"
11562,_THE BROTHERS._,"Joy to the face its own expression sent,"
11563,_THE BROTHERS._,And gave a likeness in the looks it lent.
11564,_THE BROTHERS._,All now was sober certainty; the joy
11565,_THE BROTHERS._,That no strong passions swell till they destroy:
11566,_THE BROTHERS._,"For they, like wine, our pleasures raise so high,"
11567,_THE BROTHERS._,"That they subdue our strength, and then they die."
11568,_THE BROTHERS._,"George in his brother felt a glowing pride,"
11569,_THE BROTHERS._,He wonder’d who that fertile mind supplied--             40
11570,_THE BROTHERS._,“Where could the wanderer gather on his road
11571,_THE BROTHERS._,Knowledge so various? how the mind this food?
11572,_THE BROTHERS._,"No college train’d him, guideless through his life,"
11573,_THE BROTHERS._,Without a friend--not so! he has a wife.
11574,_THE BROTHERS._,"Ah! had I married, I might now have seen"
11575,_THE BROTHERS._,"My----No! it never, never could have been,"
11576,_THE BROTHERS._,"That long enchantment, that pernicious state!--"
11577,_THE BROTHERS._,"True, I recover’d, but alas! too late--"
11578,_THE BROTHERS._,"And here is Richard, poor indeed--but--nay!"
11579,_THE BROTHERS._,"This is self-torment--foolish thoughts, away!”            50"
11580,_THE BROTHERS._,"Ease leads to habit, as success to ease,"
11581,_THE BROTHERS._,He lives by rule who lives himself to please;
11582,_THE BROTHERS._,"For change is trouble, and a man of wealth"
11583,_THE BROTHERS._,Consults his quiet as he guards his health;
11584,_THE BROTHERS._,"And habit now on George had sovereign power,"
11585,_THE BROTHERS._,His actions all had their accustom’d hour:
11586,_THE BROTHERS._,"At the fix’d time he slept, he walk’d, he read,"
11587,_THE BROTHERS._,"Or sought his grounds, his gruel, and his bed;"
11588,_THE BROTHERS._,"For every season he with caution dress’d,"
11589,_THE BROTHERS._,And morn and eve had the appropriate vest;                60
11590,_THE BROTHERS._,"He talk’d of early mists, and night’s cold air,"
11591,_THE BROTHERS._,And in one spot was fix’d his worship’s chair.
11592,_THE BROTHERS._,But not a custom yet on Richard’s mind
11593,_THE BROTHERS._,"Had force, or him to certain modes confined;"
11594,_THE BROTHERS._,To him no joy such frequent visits paid
11595,_THE BROTHERS._,That habit by its beaten track was made;
11596,_THE BROTHERS._,"He was not one who at his ease could say,"
11597,_THE BROTHERS._,“We’ll live to-morrow as we lived to-day;”
11598,_THE BROTHERS._,"But he and his were as the ravens fed,"
11599,_THE BROTHERS._,As the day came it brought the daily bread.               70
11600,_THE BROTHERS._,"George, born to fortune, though of moderate kind,"
11601,_THE BROTHERS._,Was not in haste his road through life to find.
11602,_THE BROTHERS._,"His father early lost, his mother tried               }"
11603,_THE BROTHERS._,"To live without him, liked it not, and--sigh’d,       }"
11604,_THE BROTHERS._,"When, for her widow’d hand, an amorous youth applied. }"
11605,_THE BROTHERS._,"She still was young, and felt that she could share"
11606,_THE BROTHERS._,"A lover’s passion, and an husband’s care;"
11607,_THE BROTHERS._,"Yet past twelve years before her son was told,"
11608,_THE BROTHERS._,"To his surprise, “your father you behold.”"
11609,_THE BROTHERS._,But he beheld not with his mother’s eye                   80
11610,_THE BROTHERS._,"The new relation, and would not comply,"
11611,_THE BROTHERS._,"But all obedience, all connexion spurn’d,"
11612,_THE BROTHERS._,"And fled their home, where he no more return’d."
11613,_THE BROTHERS._,His father’s brother was a man whose mind
11614,_THE BROTHERS._,Was to his business and his bank confined;
11615,_THE BROTHERS._,"His guardian care the captious nephew sought,"
11616,_THE BROTHERS._,"And was received, caress’d, advised, and taught."
11617,_THE BROTHERS._,"“That Irish beggar, whom your mother took,"
11618,_THE BROTHERS._,"Does you this good, he sends you to your book;"
11619,_THE BROTHERS._,"Yet love not books beyond their proper worth,             90"
11620,_THE BROTHERS._,"But, when they fit you for the world, go forth:"
11621,_THE BROTHERS._,"They are like beauties, and may blessings prove,"
11622,_THE BROTHERS._,"When we with caution study them, or love;"
11623,_THE BROTHERS._,"But, when to either we our souls devote,"
11624,_THE BROTHERS._,"We grow unfitted for that world, and dote.”"
11625,_THE BROTHERS._,"George to a school of higher class was sent,"
11626,_THE BROTHERS._,But he was ever grieving that he went:
11627,_THE BROTHERS._,"A still, retiring, musing, dreaming boy,"
11628,_THE BROTHERS._,He relish’d not their sudden bursts of joy;
11629,_THE BROTHERS._,"Nor the tumultuous pleasures of a rude,                  100"
11630,_THE BROTHERS._,"A noisy, careless, fearless multitude."
11631,_THE BROTHERS._,"He had his own delights, as one who flies"
11632,_THE BROTHERS._,From every pleasure that a crowd supplies;
11633,_THE BROTHERS._,"Thrice he return’d, but then was weary grown,"
11634,_THE BROTHERS._,And was indulged with studies of his own.
11635,_THE BROTHERS._,Still could the rector and his friend relate
11636,_THE BROTHERS._,The small adventures of that distant date;
11637,_THE BROTHERS._,And Richard listen’d as they spake of time
11638,_THE BROTHERS._,Past in that world of misery and crime.
11639,_THE BROTHERS._,"Freed from his school, a priest of gentle kind         110"
11640,_THE BROTHERS._,The uncle found to guide the nephew’s mind;
11641,_THE BROTHERS._,"Pleased with his teacher, George so long remain’d,"
11642,_THE BROTHERS._,The mind was weaken’d by the store it gain’d.
11643,_THE BROTHERS._,"His guardian uncle, then on foreign ground,"
11644,_THE BROTHERS._,No time to think of his improvements found;
11645,_THE BROTHERS._,"Nor had the nephew, now to manhood grown,"
11646,_THE BROTHERS._,"Talents or taste for trade or commerce shown,"
11647,_THE BROTHERS._,"But shunn’d a world of which he little knew,"
11648,_THE BROTHERS._,Nor of that little did he like the view.
11649,_THE BROTHERS._,"His mother chose, nor I the choice upbraid,            120"
11650,_THE BROTHERS._,"An Irish soldier of an house decay’d,"
11651,_THE BROTHERS._,"And passing poor; but, precious in her eyes"
11652,_THE BROTHERS._,"As she in his, they both obtain’d a prize."
11653,_THE BROTHERS._,"To do the captain justice, she might share"
11654,_THE BROTHERS._,What of her jointure his affairs could spare;
11655,_THE BROTHERS._,"Irish he was in his profusion--true,"
11656,_THE BROTHERS._,But he was Irish in affection too;
11657,_THE BROTHERS._,"And, though he spent her wealth and made her grieve,"
11658,_THE BROTHERS._,He always said “my dear” and “with your leave.”
11659,_THE BROTHERS._,Him she survived; she saw his boy possess’d              130
11660,_THE BROTHERS._,"Of manly spirit, and then sank to rest."
11661,_THE BROTHERS._,"Her sons thus left, some legal cause required"
11662,_THE BROTHERS._,"That they should meet, but neither this desired."
11663,_THE BROTHERS._,"George, a recluse, with mind engaged, was one"
11664,_THE BROTHERS._,"Who did no business, with whom none was done;"
11665,_THE BROTHERS._,"Whose heart, engross’d by its peculiar care,"
11666,_THE BROTHERS._,Shared no one’s counsel--no one his might share.
11667,_THE BROTHERS._,"Richard, a boy, a lively boy, was told"
11668,_THE BROTHERS._,"Of his half-brother, haughty, stern, and cold;"
11669,_THE BROTHERS._,"And his boy folly, or his manly pride,                   140"
11670,_THE BROTHERS._,Made him on measures cool and harsh decide.
11671,_THE BROTHERS._,"So, when they met, a distant cold salute"
11672,_THE BROTHERS._,Was of a long-expected day the fruit;
11673,_THE BROTHERS._,"The rest by proxies managed, each withdrew,"
11674,_THE BROTHERS._,Vex’d by the business and the brother too;
11675,_THE BROTHERS._,But now they met when time had calm’d the mind;
11676,_THE BROTHERS._,"Both wish’d for kindness, and it made them kind."
11677,_THE BROTHERS._,"George had no wife or child, and was disposed"
11678,_THE BROTHERS._,To love the man on whom his hope reposed:
11679,_THE BROTHERS._,"Richard had both; and those so well beloved,             150"
11680,_THE BROTHERS._,Husband and father were to kindness moved;
11681,_THE BROTHERS._,"And thus th’ affections check’d, subdued, restrain’d,"
11682,_THE BROTHERS._,"Rose in their force, and in their fulness reign’d."
11683,_THE BROTHERS._,"The bell now bids to dine; the friendly priest,"
11684,_THE BROTHERS._,"Social and shrewd, the day’s delight increased."
11685,_THE BROTHERS._,"Brief and abrupt their speeches while they dined,"
11686,_THE BROTHERS._,Nor were their themes of intellectual kind;
11687,_THE BROTHERS._,"Nor, dinner past, did they to these advance,"
11688,_THE BROTHERS._,But left the subjects they discuss’d to chance.
11689,_THE BROTHERS._,"Richard, whose boyhood in the place was spent,         160"
11690,_THE BROTHERS._,"Profound attention to the speakers lent,"
11691,_THE BROTHERS._,"Who spake of men; and, as he heard a name,"
11692,_THE BROTHERS._,Actors and actions to his memory came.
11693,_THE BROTHERS._,"Then, too, the scenes he could distinctly trace,"
11694,_THE BROTHERS._,"Here he had fought, and there had gain’d a race;"
11695,_THE BROTHERS._,In that church-walk he had affrighted been;
11696,_THE BROTHERS._,In that old tower he had a something seen--
11697,_THE BROTHERS._,"What time, dismiss’d from school, he upward cast"
11698,_THE BROTHERS._,"A fearful look, and trembled as he past."
11699,_THE BROTHERS._,"No private tutor Richard’s parents sought,             170"
11700,_THE BROTHERS._,"Made keen by hardship, and by trouble taught;"
11701,_THE BROTHERS._,They might have sent him--some the counsel gave--
11702,_THE BROTHERS._,Seven gloomy winters of the North to brave:
11703,_THE BROTHERS._,"Where a few pounds would pay for board and bed,"
11704,_THE BROTHERS._,While the poor frozen boy was taught and fed;
11705,_THE BROTHERS._,"When, say he lives, fair, freckled, lank and lean,"
11706,_THE BROTHERS._,"The lad returns shrewd, subtle, close and keen;"
11707,_THE BROTHERS._,"With all the northern virtues, and the rules"
11708,_THE BROTHERS._,Taught to the thrifty in these thriving schools.
11709,_THE BROTHERS._,"There had he gone, and borne this trying part--         180"
11710,_THE BROTHERS._,But Richard’s mother had a mother’s heart.
11711,_THE BROTHERS._,"Now squire and rector were return’d to school,"
11712,_THE BROTHERS._,And spoke of him who there had sovereign rule:
11713,_THE BROTHERS._,"He was, it seem’d, a tyrant of the sort"
11714,_THE BROTHERS._,Who make the cries of tortured boys his sport;
11715,_THE BROTHERS._,"One of a race, if not extinguish’d, tamed--"
11716,_THE BROTHERS._,The flogger now is of the act ashamed;
11717,_THE BROTHERS._,But this great mind all mercy’s calls withstood;
11718,_THE BROTHERS._,This Holofernes was a man of blood.
11719,_THE BROTHERS._,"“Students,” he said, “like horses on the road,         190"
11720,_THE BROTHERS._,Must well be lash’d before they take the load;
11721,_THE BROTHERS._,"They may be willing for a time to run,"
11722,_THE BROTHERS._,But you must whip them ere the work be done.
11723,_THE BROTHERS._,"To tell a boy, that, if he will improve,"
11724,_THE BROTHERS._,"His friends will praise him, and his parents love,"
11725,_THE BROTHERS._,Is doing nothing--he has not a doubt
11726,_THE BROTHERS._,"But they will love him, nay, applaud, without;"
11727,_THE BROTHERS._,"Let no fond sire a boy’s ambition trust,"
11728,_THE BROTHERS._,"To make him study, let him see he must.”"
11729,_THE BROTHERS._,"Such his opinion; and, to prove it true,               200"
11730,_THE BROTHERS._,"At least sincere, it was his practice too."
11731,_THE BROTHERS._,"Pluto they call’d him, and they named him well:"
11732,_THE BROTHERS._,’Twas not an heaven where he was pleased to dwell.
11733,_THE BROTHERS._,"From him a smile was like the Greenland sun,"
11734,_THE BROTHERS._,"Surprising, nay portentous, when it shone;"
11735,_THE BROTHERS._,"Or like the lightning, for the sudden flash"
11736,_THE BROTHERS._,Prepared the children for the thunder’s crash.
11737,_THE BROTHERS._,"O! had Narcissa, when she fondly kiss’d"
11738,_THE BROTHERS._,"The weeping boy whom she to school dismiss’d,"
11739,_THE BROTHERS._,Had she beheld him shrinking from the arm                210
11740,_THE BROTHERS._,"Uplifted high to do the greater harm,"
11741,_THE BROTHERS._,"Then seen her darling stript, and that pure white,"
11742,_THE BROTHERS._,And--O! her soul had fainted at the sight;
11743,_THE BROTHERS._,"And with those looks that love could not withstand,"
11744,_THE BROTHERS._,"She would have cried, “Barbarian, hold thy hand!”"
11745,_THE BROTHERS._,"In vain! no grief to this stern soul could speak,"
11746,_THE BROTHERS._,No iron-tear roll down this Pluto’s cheek.
11747,_THE BROTHERS._,"Thus far they went, half earnest, half in jest,"
11748,_THE BROTHERS._,Then turn’d to themes of deeper interest;
11749,_THE BROTHERS._,"While Richard’s mind, that for awhile had stray’d,       220"
11750,_THE BROTHERS._,"Call’d home its powers, and due attention paid."

11773,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"We name the world a school, for day by day"
11774,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"We something learn, till we are call’d away;"
11775,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The school we name a world,--for vice and pain,"
11776,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Fraud and contention, there begin to reign;"
11777,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And much, in fact, this lesser world can show"
11778,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Of grief and crime that in the greater grow.
11779,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“You saw,” said George, “in that still-hated school"
11780,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"How the meek suffer, how the haughty rule;"
11781,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"There soft, ingenuous, gentle minds endure"
11782,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Ills that ease, time, and friendship fail to cure;        10"
11783,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"There the best hearts, and those, who shrink from sin,"
11784,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Find some seducing imp to draw them in,"
11785,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Who takes infernal pleasure to impart
11786,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,The strongest poison to the purest heart.
11787,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Call to your mind this scene--Yon boy behold:
11788,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,How hot the vengeance of a heart so cold!
11789,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"See how he beats, whom he had just reviled"
11790,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And made rebellious--that imploring child;
11791,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"How fierce his eye, how merciless his blows,"
11792,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And how his anger on his insult grows;                    20
11793,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"You saw this Hector and his patient slave,"
11794,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Th’ insulting speech, the cruel blows he gave."
11795,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Mix’d with mankind, his interest in his sight,"
11796,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,We found this Nimrod civil and polite;
11797,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"There was no triumph in his manner seen,"
11798,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,He was so humble you might think him mean.
11799,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Those angry passions slept till he attain’d
11800,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His purposed wealth, and waked when that was gain’d;"
11801,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He then resumed the native wrath and pride,"
11802,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The more indulged, as longer laid aside;                  30"
11803,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Wife, children, servants, all obedience pay,"
11804,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,The slaves at school no greater slaves than they;
11805,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"No more dependant, he resumes the rein,"
11806,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And shows the school-boy turbulence again.
11807,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Were I a poet, I would say, he brings"
11808,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,To recollection some impetuous springs;
11809,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"See one that issues from its humble source,"
11810,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"To gain new powers, and run its noisy course:"
11811,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Frothy and fierce among the rocks it goes,"
11812,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And threatens all that bound it or oppose;                40
11813,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Till wider grown, and finding large increase,"
11814,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Though bounded still, it moves along in peace;"
11815,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And, as its waters to the ocean glide,"
11816,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,They bear a busy people on its tide;
11817,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But there arrived, and from its channel free,"
11818,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Those swelling waters meet the mighty sea;
11819,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"With threat’ning force the new-form’d billows swell,"
11820,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And now affright the crowd they bore so well.”
11821,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Yet,” said the rector, “all these early signs"
11822,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Of vice are lost, and vice itself declines;               50"
11823,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Religion counsels; troubles, sorrows rise,"
11824,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And the vile spirit in the conflict dies.
11825,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Sir Hector Blane, the champion of the school,"
11826,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Was very blockhead, but was form’d for rule;"
11827,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Learn he could not; he said he could not learn,"
11828,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But he profess’d it gave him no concern.
11829,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Books were his horror, dinner his delight,"
11830,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And his amusement to shake hands and fight;
11831,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Argue he could not, but in case of doubt,"
11832,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Or disputation, fairly box’d it out.                      60"
11833,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"This was his logic, and his arm so strong,"
11834,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His cause prevail’d, and he was never wrong;"
11835,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But so obtuse--you must have seen his look,"
11836,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Desponding, angry, puzzled o’er his book."
11837,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,“Can you not see him on the morn that proved
11838,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,His skill in figures? Pluto’s self was moved--
11839,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘Come, six times five?’ th’ impatient teacher cried;"
11840,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"In vain, the pupil shut his eyes, and sigh’d."
11841,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘Try, six times count your fingers; how he stands!--"
11842,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Your fingers, idiot!’--‘What, of both my hands?’          70"
11843,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“With parts like these his father felt assured,"
11844,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"In busy times, a ship might be procured;"
11845,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,He too was pleased to be so early freed:
11846,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He now could fight, and he in time might read."
11847,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"So he has fought, and in his country’s cause"
11848,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Has gain’d him glory, and our hearts’ applause."
11849,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,No more the blustering boy a school defies;             }
11850,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"We see the hero from the tyrant rise,                   }"
11851,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And in the captain’s worth the student’s dulness dies.” }
11852,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Be all allow’d;” replied the squire, “I give           80"
11853,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Praise to his actions; may their glory live!
11854,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Nay, I will hear him in his riper age"
11855,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Fight his good ship, and with the foe engage;"
11856,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Nor will I quit him when the cowards fly,"
11857,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Although, like them, I dread his energy."
11858,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“But still, my friend, that ancient spirit reigns;"
11859,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His powers support the credit of his brains,"
11860,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Insisting ever that he must be right,"
11861,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And for his reasons still prepared to fight.
11862,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Let him a judge of England’s prowess be,                  90"
11863,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And all her floating terrors on the sea;
11864,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But this contents not, this is not denied;"
11865,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He claims a right on all things to decide,"
11866,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A kind of patent-wisdom; and he cries,"
11867,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,‘’Tis so!’ and bold the hero that denies.
11868,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Thus the boy-spirit still the bosom rules,"
11869,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And the world’s maxims were at first the school’s.”
11870,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“No doubt,” said Jacques, “there are in minds the seeds"
11871,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Of good and ill, the virtues and the weeds;"
11872,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But is it not of study the intent                        100
11873,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,This growth of evil nature to prevent?
11874,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,To check the progress of each idle shoot
11875,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,That might retard the ripening of the fruit?
11876,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Our purpose certain, and we much effect,"
11877,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"We something cure, and something we correct;"
11878,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But do your utmost: when the man you see,"
11879,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"You find him what you saw the boy would be,"
11880,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Disguised a little; but we still behold
11881,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,What pleased and what offended us of old.
11882,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Years from the mind no native stain remove,              110"
11883,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But lay the varnish of the world above.
11884,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Still, when he can, he loves to step aside"
11885,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And be the boy, without a check or guide;"
11886,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"In the old wanderings he with pleasure strays,"
11887,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And reassumes the bliss of earlier days.
11888,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“I left at school the boy with pensive look,"
11889,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Whom some great patron order’d to his book;
11890,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Who from his mother’s cot reluctant came,"
11891,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And gave my lord, for this compassion, fame;"
11892,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Who, told of all his patron’s merit, sigh’d,             120"
11893,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"I know not why, in sorrow or in pride;"
11894,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And would, with vex’d and troubled spirit, cry,"
11895,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,‘I am not happy; let your envy die.’
11896,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Him left I with you; who, perhaps, can tell"
11897,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"If fortune bless’d him, or what fate befell."
11898,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,I yet remember how the idlers ran
11899,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"To see the carriage of the godlike man,"
11900,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,When pride restrain’d me; yet I thought the deed
11901,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Was noble, too--and how did it succeed?”"
11902,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Jacques answer’d not till he had backward cast         130
11903,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His view, and dwelt upon the evil past;"
11904,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Then, as he sigh’d, he smil’d;--from folly rise"
11905,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Such smiles, and misery will create such sighs."
11906,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And Richard now from his abstraction broke,"
11907,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Listening attentive as the rector spoke.

11912,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And weigh the worth of each new luxury;
11913,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Now, at a certain time, in pleasant mood,"
11914,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,He tried the luxury of doing good.
11915,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"For this he chose a widow’s handsome boy,                140"
11916,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Whom he would first improve, and then employ."
11917,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The boy was gentle, modest, civil, kind,"
11918,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But not for bustling through the world design’d;
11919,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Reserved in manner, with a little gloom,"
11920,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Apt to retire, but never to assume;"
11921,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Possess’d of pride that he could not subdue,"
11922,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Although he kept his origin in view.
11923,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Him sent my lord to school, and this became"
11924,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A theme for praise, and gave his lordship fame;"
11925,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But when the boy was told how great his debt,            150"
11926,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He proudly ask’d, ‘is it contracted yet?’"
11927,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“With care he studied, and with some success;"
11928,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His patience great, but his acquirements less:"
11929,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Yet when he heard that Charles would not excel,"
11930,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His lordship answer’d, with a smile, ‘’tis well;"
11931,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Let him proceed, and do the best he can,"
11932,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"I want no pedant, but a useful man.’"
11933,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“The speech was heard, and praise was amply dealt,"
11934,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His lordship felt it, and he said he felt--"
11935,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘It is delightful,’ he observed, ‘to raise               160"
11936,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And foster merit--it is more than praise.’
11937,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Five years at school th’ industrious boy had past,"
11938,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘And what,’ was whisper’d, ‘will be done at last?’"
11939,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“My lord was troubled, for he did not mean"
11940,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,To have his bounty watch’d and overseen;
11941,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Bounty that sleeps when men applaud no more
11942,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,The generous act that waked their praise before;
11943,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The deed was pleasant while the praise was new,"
11944,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But none the progress would with wonder view.
11945,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,It was a debt contracted; he who pays                    170
11946,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A debt is just, but must not look for praise:"
11947,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The deed that once had fame must still proceed,"
11948,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Though fame no more proclaims ‘how great the deed!’
11949,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The boy is taken from his mother’s side,"
11950,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And he who took him must be now his guide.
11951,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But this, alas! instead of bringing fame,"
11952,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A tax, a trouble, to my lord became."
11953,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“‘The boy is dull, you say,--why then by trade,"
11954,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"By law, by physic, nothing can be made;"
11955,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"If a small living--mine are both too large,              180"
11956,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And then the college is a cursed charge.
11957,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,The sea is open; should he there display
11958,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Signs of dislike, he cannot run away.’"
11959,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Now Charles, who acted no heroic part,"
11960,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And felt no seaman’s glory warm his heart,"
11961,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Refused the offer--anger touch’d my lord.--
11962,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘He does not like it--Good, upon my word--"
11963,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"If I at college place him, he will need"
11964,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Supplies for ever, and will not succeed;--"
11965,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Doubtless in me ’tis duty to provide                     190
11966,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Not for his comfort only, but his pride--"
11967,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Let him to sea!’--He heard the words again,"
11968,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,With promise join’d--with threat’ning; all in vain:
11969,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Charles had his own pursuits; for aid to these
11970,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He had been thankful, and had tried to please;"
11971,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But urged again, as meekly as a saint,"
11972,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He humbly begg’d to stay at home, and paint."
11973,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘Yes, pay some dauber, that this stubborn fool"
11974,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"May grind his colours, and may boast his school.’"
11975,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“As both persisted, ‘Choose, good sir, your way,’      200"
11976,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The peer exclaim’d, ‘I have no more to say,"
11977,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"I seek your good, but I have no command"
11978,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Upon your will, nor your desire withstand.’"
11979,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Resolved and firm, yet dreading to offend,"
11980,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Charles pleaded _genius_ with his noble friend:
11981,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘Genius!’ he cried, ‘the name that triflers give"
11982,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,To their strong wishes without pains to live;
11983,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Genius! the plea of all who feel desire
11984,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Of fame, yet grudge the labours that acquire--"
11985,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But say ’tis true: how poor, how late the gain,          210"
11986,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And certain ruin if the hope be vain!’
11987,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Then to the world appeal’d my lord, and cried,"
11988,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘Whatever happens, I am justified.’"
11989,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Nay, it was trouble to his soul to find"
11990,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,There was such hardness in the human mind:
11991,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He wash’d his hands before the world, and swore"
11992,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,That he ‘such minds would patronize no more.’
11993,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Now Charles his bread by daily labours sought,"
11994,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And this his solace, ‘so Corregio wrought.’"
11995,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Alas, poor youth! however great his name,                220"
11996,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And humble thine, thy fortune was the same."
11997,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Charles drew and painted, and some praise obtain’d"
11998,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,For care and pains; but little more was gain’d:
11999,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Fame was his hope, and he contempt display’d"
12000,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"For approbation, when ’twas coolly paid;"
12001,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His daily tasks he call’d a waste of mind,"
12002,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Vex’d at his fate, and angry with mankind:"
12003,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"‘Thus have the blind to merit ever done,"
12004,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And Genius mourn’d for each neglected son.’
12005,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Charles murmur’d thus, and, angry and alone,          230"
12006,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Half breathed the curse, and half suppress’d the groan;"
12007,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Then still more sullen grew, and still more proud;    }"
12008,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Fame so refused he to himself allow’d;                }
12009,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Crowds in contempt he held, and all to him was crowd. }"
12010,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“If aught on earth, the youth his mother loved,"
12011,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And, at her death, to distant scenes removed."
12012,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Years past away, and where he lived, and how,"
12013,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Was then unknown--indeed we know not now;
12014,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But once at twilight walking up and down,"
12015,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"In a poor alley of the mighty town,                      240"
12016,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Where, in her narrow courts and garrets, hide"
12017,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The grieving sons of genius, want, and pride,"
12018,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"I met him musing; sadness I could trace,"
12019,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And conquer’d hope’s meek anguish, in his face."
12020,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"See him I must; but I with ease address’d,"
12021,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And neither pity nor surprise express’d;
12022,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"I strove both grief and pleasure to restrain,"
12023,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But yet I saw that I was giving pain.
12024,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He said, with quick’ning pace, as loth to hold"
12025,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A longer converse, that ‘the day was cold,               250"
12026,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"That he was well, that I had scarcely light"
12027,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"To aid my steps,’ and bade me then good night!"
12028,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“I saw him next where he had lately come,"
12029,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,A silent pauper in a crowded room;
12030,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"I heard his name, but he conceal’d his face,"
12031,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,To his sad mind his misery was disgrace;
12032,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,In vain I strove to combat his disdain
12033,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Of my compassion----‘Sir, I pray, refrain;’"
12034,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"For I had left my friends and stepp’d aside,"
12035,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Because I fear’d his unrelenting pride.                  260
12036,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“He then was sitting on a workhouse-bed,"
12037,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And on the naked boards reclined his head,"
12038,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Around were children with incessant cry,"
12039,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And near was one, like him, about to die;"
12040,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,A broken chair’s deal bottom held the store
12041,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,That he required--he soon would need no more;
12042,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A yellow tea-pot, standing at his side,"
12043,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"From its half-spout the cold, black tea supplied."
12044,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Hither, it seem’d, the fainting man was brought,"
12045,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Found without food--it was no longer sought;             270
12046,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"For his employers knew not whom they paid,"
12047,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Nor where to seek him whom they wish’d to aid.
12048,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Here brought, some kind attendant he address’d,"
12049,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And sought some trifles which he yet possess’d;
12050,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Then named a lightless closet, in a room"
12051,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Hired at small rate, a garret’s deepest gloom."
12052,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"They sought the region, and they brought him all"
12053,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"That he his own, his proper wealth could call:"
12054,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A better coat, less pieced; some linen neat,"
12055,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Not whole; and papers, many a valued sheet--            280"
12056,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Designs and drawings; these, at his desire,"
12057,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Were placed before him at the chamber fire,"
12058,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And while th’ admiring people stood to gaze,"
12059,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He, one by one, committed to the blaze,"
12060,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Smiling in spleen; but one he held awhile,"
12061,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And gave it to the flames, and could not smile."
12062,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,“The sickening man--for such appear’d the fact--
12063,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Just in his need, would not a debt contract;"
12064,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But left his poor apartment for the bed
12065,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"That earth might yield him, or some way-side shed;       290"
12066,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Here he was found, and to this place convey’d,"
12067,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Where he might rest, and his last debt be paid:"
12068,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Fame was his wish, but he so far from fame,            }"
12069,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"That no one knew his kindred, or his name,             }"
12070,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Or by what means he lived, or from what place he came. }"
12071,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Poor Charles! unnoticed by thy titled friend,"
12072,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Thy days had calmly past, in peace thine end;"
12073,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Led by thy patron’s vanity astray,"
12074,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Thy own misled thee in thy trackless way,"
12075,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Urging thee on by hope absurd and vain,                  300"
12076,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Where never peace or comfort smiled again!
12077,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Once more I saw him, when his spirits fail’d,"
12078,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And my desire to aid him then prevail’d;
12079,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He show’d a softer feeling in his eye,"
12080,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And watch’d my looks, and own’d the sympathy."
12081,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,’Twas now the calm of wearied pride; so long
12082,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,As he had strength was his resentment strong;
12083,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"But in such place, with strangers all around,"
12084,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And they such strangers, to have something found"
12085,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Allied to his own heart, an early friend--         }     310"
12086,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"One, only one, who would on him attend,            }"
12087,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,To give and take a look at this his journey’s end! }
12088,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"One link, however slender, of the chain"
12089,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,That held him where he could not long remain;
12090,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The one sole interest!--No, he could not now"
12091,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Retain his anger; Nature knew not how;
12092,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And so there came a softness to his mind,"
12093,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And he forgave the usage of mankind.
12094,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His cold long fingers now were press’d to mine,"
12095,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And his faint smile of kinder thoughts gave sign;        320
12096,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,His lips moved often as he tried to lend
12097,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"His words their sound, and softly whisper’d ‘friend!’"
12098,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Not without comfort in the thought express’d
12099,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,By that calm look with which he sank to rest.”

12117,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,He who with noble indignation glow’d
12118,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,When vice had triumph? who his tear bestow’d

12130,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Ah! sure th’ experienced man has not resign’d;
12131,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Or are these feelings varied? has the knight,"
12132,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Virtue’s own champion, now refused to fight?"
12133,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Is the deliverer turn’d th’ oppressor now?
12134,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Has the reformer dropt the dangerous vow?

12139,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Here will I pause, and then review the shame          360"
12140,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Of Harry Bland, to hear his parent’s name."
12141,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"That mild, that modest boy, whom well we knew,"
12142,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,In him long time the secret sorrow grew;
12143,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,He wept alone; then to his friend confess’d
12144,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,The grievous fears that his pure mind oppress’d;
12145,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And thus, when terror o’er his shame obtain’d"
12146,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"A painful conquest, he his case explain’d;"
12147,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"And first his favourite question’d--‘Willie, tell,"
12148,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Do all the wicked people go to hell?’
12149,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“Willie with caution answer’d, ‘Yes, they do,          370"

12166,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,He puts his anger on to hide his shame.’
12167,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"“With all these feelings delicate and nice,"
12168,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"This dread of infamy, this scorn of vice,"
12169,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He left the school, accepting, though with pride,        390"
12170,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,His father’s aid--but there would not reside;
12171,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"He married then a lovely maid, approved"
12172,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,Of every heart as worthy to be loved;

12179,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"’Tis not that men are to the evil blind,                 400"
12180,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,But that a different object fills the mind.
12181,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,In judging others we can see too well
12182,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Their grievous fall, but not how grieved they fell;"
12183,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Judging ourselves, we to our minds recall,"
12184,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Not how we fell, but how we grieved to fall."
12185,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Or could this man, so vex’d in early time,"
12186,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,By this strong feeling for his father’s crime;
12187,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Who to the parent’s sin was barely just,"
12188,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,And mix’d with filial fear the man’s disgust--
12189,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Could he, without some strong delusion, quit             410"
12190,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"The path of duty, and to shame submit?"

12194,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,"Features, it seem’d, of powerful cast displayed,"
12195,_BOYS AT SCHOOL._,That bore down faith and duty; common fame

12245,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Eight days had past; the Brothers now could meet
12246,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"With ease, and take the customary seat."
12247,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“These” said the host--for he perceived where stray’d
12248,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"His brother’s eye, and what he now survey’d--"
12249,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“These are the costly trifles that we buy,"
12250,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Urged by the strong demands of vanity,"
12251,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The thirst and hunger of a mind diseased,"
12252,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,That must with purchased flattery be appeased;
12253,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"But yet, ’tis true, the things that you behold"
12254,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Serve to amuse us as we’re getting old.                   10
12255,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"These pictures, as I heard our artists say,"
12256,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Are genuine all, and I believe they may;"
12257,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"They cost the genuine sums, and I should grieve"
12258,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"If, being willing, I could not believe."
12259,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And there is music; when the ladies come,"
12260,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,With their keen looks they scrutinize the room
12261,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"To see what pleases, and I must expect"
12262,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"To yield them pleasure, or to find neglect:"
12263,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"For, as attractions from our person fly,"
12264,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Our purses, Richard, must the want supply;                20"
12265,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Yet would it vex me, could the triflers know"
12266,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,That they can shut out comfort or bestow.
12267,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“But see this room: here, Richard, you will find"
12268,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Books for all palates, food for every mind;"
12269,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"This readers term the ever-new delight,"
12270,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And so it is, if minds have appetite:"
12271,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Mine once was craving; great my joy, indeed,"
12272,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Had I possess’d such food when I could feed;
12273,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,When at the call of every new-born wish
12274,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,I could have keenly relish’d every dish--                30
12275,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Now, Richard, now, I stalk around and look"
12276,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Upon the dress and title of a book,"
12277,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Try half a page, and then can taste no more,"
12278,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,But the dull volume to its place restore;
12279,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Begin a second slowly to peruse,"
12280,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Then cast it by, and look about for news;"
12281,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,The news itself grows dull in long debates--
12282,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I skip, and see what the conclusion states;"
12283,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And many a speech, with zeal and study made"

12298,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Not yet erect, the wanderer’s way betray’d;"
12299,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Showers of the night had swell’d the deep’ning rill;

12306,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Long yellow leaves from oziers, strew’d around,"
12307,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Choked the small stream, and hush’d the feeble sound;     60"
12308,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,While the dead foliage dropt from loftier trees
12309,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Our squire beheld not with his wonted ease,"
12310,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"But to his own reflections made reply,"
12311,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And said aloud, “Yes! doubtless we must die.”"
12312,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“We must;” said Richard, “and we would not live"
12313,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,To feel what dotage and decay will give;
12314,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,But we yet taste whatever we behold:
12315,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The morn is lovely, though the air is cold;"
12316,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"There is delicious quiet in this scene,"
12317,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"At once so rich, so varied, so serene;                    70"
12318,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Sounds too delight us--each discordant tone
12319,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Thus mingled please, that fail to please alone:"
12320,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"This hollow wind, this rustling of the brook,   }"
12321,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The farm-yard noise, the woodman at yon oak--   }"
12322,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"See, the axe falls!--now listen to the stroke!  }"
12323,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"That gun itself, that murders all this peace,"
12324,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Adds to the charm, because it soon must cease.”"
12325,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“No doubt,” said George, “the country has its charms!"
12326,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,My farm behold! the model for all farms!
12327,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Look at that land--you find not there a weed,             80"
12328,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"We grub the roots, and suffer none to seed."
12329,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"To land like this no botanist will come,"
12330,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,To seek the precious ware he hides at home;
12331,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Pressing the leaves and flowers with effort nice,"
12332,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,As if they came from herbs in Paradise;
12333,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Let them their favourites with my neighbours see,"
12334,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,They have no--what?--no _habitat_ with me.
12335,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Now see my flock, and hear its glory;--none"
12336,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Have that vast body and that slender bone;
12337,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"They are the village boast, the dealer’s theme,           90"
12338,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Fleece of such staple! flesh in such esteem!”
12339,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Brother,” said Richard, “do I hear aright?"
12340,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Does the land truly give so much delight?”
12341,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“So says my bailiff; sometimes I have tried
12342,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"To catch the joy, but nature has denied;"
12343,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,It will not be--the mind has had a store
12344,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Laid up for life, and will admit no more."
12345,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Worn out in trials, and about to die,"
12346,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,In vain to these we for amusement fly;
12347,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"We farm, we garden, we our poor employ,                  100"
12348,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And much command, though little we enjoy;"
12349,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Or, if ambitious, we employ our pen,"
12350,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"We plant a desert, or we drain a fen;"
12351,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And--here, behold my medal!--this will show"
12352,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,What men may merit when they nothing know.”
12353,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Yet reason here,” said Richard, “joins with pride:--”"
12354,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“I did not ask th’ alliance,” George replied--"
12355,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“I grant it true, such trifle may induce"
12356,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"A dull, proud man to wake and be of use;"
12357,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And there are purer pleasures, that a mind               110"
12358,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Calm and uninjured may in villas find;
12359,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"But, where th’ affections have been deeply tried,"
12360,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,With other food that mind must be supplied:
12361,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,’Tis not in trees or medals to impart
12362,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,The powerful medicine for an aching heart;
12363,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The agitation dies, but there is still"
12364,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The backward spirit, the resisting will."
12365,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Man takes his body to a country seat,"
12366,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"But minds, dear Richard, have their own retreat;"
12367,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Oft when the feet are pacing o’er the green              120
12368,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The mind is gone where never grass was seen,"
12369,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And never thinks of hill, or vale, or plain,              }"
12370,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Till want of rest creates a sense of pain,                }"
12371,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"That calls that wandering mind, and brings it home again. }"
12372,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,No more of farms; but here I boast of minds
12373,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,That make a friend the richer when he finds:
12374,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"These shalt thou see;--but, Richard, be it known,"
12375,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Who thinks to see must in his turn be shown.--
12376,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,But now farewell! to thee will I resign

12384,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"When reason, duty, nay, when kindness fails."
12385,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Yet food and wine, and all that mortals bless,"
12386,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Lead them to think of peril and distress--
12387,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Cold, hunger, danger, solitude, and pain,"

12397,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Some will, ’tis true, a bolder freedom take,"
12398,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And keep our wonder always wide awake;

12400,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Our frail belief, that trembles as we read:              150"

12404,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"A tiger’s fury, or a lady’s charms;"
12405,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Beside th’ accumulated evils borne
12406,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,From the bold outset to the safe return.
12407,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,These men abuse; but thou hast fair pretence

12414,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Where beast-like man devours his fellow beast,"
12415,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And churn’d the bleeding life? while each great dame
12416,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And sovereign beauty bade adieu to shame?
12417,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Or did the storm, that thy wreck’d pinnace bore,"
12418,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Impel thee gasping on some unknown shore;
12419,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Where, when thy beard and nails were savage grown,"

12464,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Could reach me, now on sweeping surges tost,"
12465,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And then between the rising billows lost;
12466,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,An undefined sensation stopp’d my breath;
12467,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Disorder’d views and threat’ning signs of death
12468,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Met in one moment, and a terror gave--"
12469,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,I cannot paint it--to the moving grave.

12522,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,To think of all thy perils--it was wrong;
12523,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,But do forgive me; for I could not be
12524,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Than of myself more negligent of thee.
12525,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Now tell me, Richard, from the boyish years"
12526,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Of thy young mind, that now so rich appears,             270"
12527,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"How was it stored? ’twas told me, thou wert wild,"
12528,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"A truant urchin, a neglected child."
12529,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I heard of this escape, and sat supine"
12530,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Amid the danger that exceeded thine;
12531,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Thou couldst but die--the waves could but infold
12532,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Thy warm, gay heart, and make that bosom cold--"
12533,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"While I--but no! Proceed, and give me truth;"
12534,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,How past the years of thy unguided youth?
12535,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Thy father left thee to the care of one
12536,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Who could not teach, could ill support a son;            280"
12537,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Yet time and trouble feeble minds have stay’d,"
12538,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And fit for long-neglected duties made.
12539,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I see thee struggling in the world, as late"
12540,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Within the waves, and, with an equal fate,"
12541,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"By Heaven preserved--but tell me, whence and how"
12542,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Thy gleaning came?--a dexterous gleaner thou!”
12543,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Left by that father, who was known to few,"
12544,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And to that mother, who has not her due"
12545,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Of honest fame,” said Richard, “our retreat"
12546,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Was a small cottage, for our station meet,               290"
12547,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"On Barford Downs; that mother, fond and poor,"
12548,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"There taught some truths, and bade me seek for more,"
12549,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Such as our village-school and books a few
12550,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Supplied; but such I cared not to pursue.
12551,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I sought the town, and to the ocean gave"
12552,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"My mind and thoughts, as restless as the wave;"
12553,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Where crowds assembled, I was sure to run,"
12554,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Hear[d] what was said, and mused on what was done;"
12555,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Attentive listening in the moving scene,"
12556,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And often wondering what the men could mean.             300
12557,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“When ships at sea made signals of their need,"
12558,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I watch’d on shore the sailors, and their speed;"
12559,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Mix’d in their act, nor rested till I knew"
12560,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Why they were call’d, and what they were to do."

12565,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“To me the wives of seamen loved to tell
12566,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,What storms endanger’d men esteem’d so well;             310
12567,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"What wond’rous things in foreign parts they saw,"
12568,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Lands without bounds, and people without law."
12569,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“No ships were wreck’d upon that fatal beach,"
12570,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,But I could give the luckless tale of each;
12571,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Eager I look’d, till I beheld a face"
12572,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Of one disposed to paint their dismal case;
12573,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Who gave the sad survivors’ doleful tale,"
12574,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,From the first brushing of the mighty gale
12575,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Until they struck; and, suffering in their fate,"
12576,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,I long’d the more they should its horrors state;         320
12577,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"While some, the fond of pity, would enjoy"
12578,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,The earnest sorrows of the feeling boy.
12579,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“I sought the men return’d from regions cold,"
12580,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The frozen straits, where icy mountains roll’d;"
12581,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Some I could win to tell me serious tales
12582,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Of boats uplifted by enormous whales,"
12583,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Or, when harpoon’d, how swiftly through the sea"
12584,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,The wounded monsters with the cordage flee.
12585,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Yet some uneasy thoughts assail’d me then:
12586,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The monsters warr’d not with, nor wounded, men.          330"
12587,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The smaller fry we take, with scales and fins,"
12588,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Who gasp and die--this adds not to our sins;
12589,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"But so much blood, warm life, and frames so large"
12590,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"To strike, to murder--seem’d an heavy charge."
12591,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“They told of days, where many goes to one--"
12592,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Such days as ours; and how a larger sun,"
12593,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Red, but not flaming, roll’d, with motion slow,"
12594,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"On the world’s edge, and never dropt below."
12595,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“There were fond girls, who took me to their side"
12596,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,To tell the story how their lovers died;                 340
12597,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"They praised my tender heart, and bade me prove"
12598,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Both kind and constant when I came to love.
12599,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"In fact, I lived for many an idle year"
12600,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,In fond pursuit of agitations dear;
12601,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"For ever seeking, ever pleased to find,"
12602,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The food I loved, I thought not of its kind;"
12603,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"It gave affliction while it brought delight,"
12604,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And joy and anguish could at once excite.
12605,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“One gusty day, now stormy and now still,"
12606,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I stood apart upon the western hill,                     350"
12607,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And saw a race at sea: a gun was heard,"
12608,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And two contending boats in sail appear’d,"
12609,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Equal awhile; then one was left behind,"
12610,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And for a moment had her chance resign’d,"
12611,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"When, in that moment, up a sail they drew--"
12612,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Not used before--their rivals to pursue.
12613,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Strong was the gale! in hurry now there came
12614,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Men from the town, their thoughts, their fears the same;"
12615,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And women too! affrighted maids and wives,"
12616,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,All deeply feeling for their sailors’ lives.             360
12617,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“The strife continued; in a glass we saw
12618,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The desperate efforts, and we stood in awe:"
12619,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"When the last boat shot suddenly before,"
12620,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Then fill’d, and sank--and could be seen no more!"
12621,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Then were those piercing shrieks, that frantic flight,"
12622,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,All hurried! all in tumult and affright!
12623,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,A gathering crowd from different streets drew near;
12624,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"All ask, all answer--none attend, none hear!"
12625,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“One boat is safe; and see! she backs her sail
12626,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,To save the sinking--Will her care avail?                370
12627,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“O! how impatient on the sands we tread,"
12628,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And the winds roaring, and the women led,"
12629,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"As up and down they pace with frantic air,"
12630,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And scorn a comforter, and will despair;"
12631,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"They know not who in either boat is gone,"
12632,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"But think the father, husband, lover, one."
12633,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“And who is she apart? She dares not come
12634,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"To join the crowd, yet cannot rest at home:"
12635,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"With what strong interest looks she at the waves,"
12636,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Meeting and clashing o’er the seamen’s graves:           380
12637,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"’Tis a poor girl betroth’d--a few hours more,"
12638,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And _he_ will lie a corpse upon the shore.
12639,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Strange, that a boy could love these scenes, and cry"
12640,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,In very pity--but that boy was I.
12641,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"With pain my mother would my tales receive,"
12642,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And say, ‘my Richard, do not learn to grieve.’"
12643,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“One wretched hour had past before we knew
12644,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Whom they had saved! Alas! they were but two,"
12645,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,An orphan’d lad and widow’d man--no more!
12646,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And they unnoticed stood upon the shore,                 390"
12647,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,With scarce a friend to greet them--widows view’d
12648,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"This man and boy, and then their cries renew’d;--"
12649,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,’Twas long before the signs of wo gave place
12650,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,To joy again; grief sat on every face.
12651,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Sure of my mother’s kindness, and the joy"
12652,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"She felt in meeting her rebellious boy,"
12653,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I at my pleasure our new seat forsook,"
12654,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And, undirected, these excursions took:"
12655,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I often rambled to the noisy quay,"
12656,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Strange sounds to hear, and business strange to me;      400"
12657,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Seamen and carmen, and I know not who,"
12658,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"A lewd, amphibious, rude, contentious crew--"
12659,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Confused as bees appear about their hive,"
12660,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Yet all alert to keep their work alive.
12661,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Here, unobserved as weed upon the wave,"
12662,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,My whole attention to the scene I gave;
12663,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I saw their tasks, their toil, their care, their skill,"
12664,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Led by their own and by a master-will;
12665,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And, though contending, toiling, tugging on,"
12666,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,The purposed business of the day was done.               410
12667,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“The open shops of craftsmen caught my eye,"
12668,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And there my questions met the kind reply:
12669,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Men, when alone, will teach; but, in a crowd,"
12670,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The child is silent, or the man is proud;"
12671,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"But, by themselves, there is attention paid"
12672,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"To a mild boy, so forward, yet afraid."
12673,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“I made me interest at the inn’s fire-side,"
12674,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Amid the scenes to bolder boys denied;
12675,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"For I had patrons there, and I was one,"
12676,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"They judged, who noticed nothing that was done.          420"
12677,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,‘A quiet lad!’ would my protector say;
12678,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"‘To him, now, this is better than his play:"
12679,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Boys are as men; some active, shrewd, and keen,"
12680,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,They look about if aught is to be seen;
12681,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And some, like Richard here, have not a mind"
12682,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,That takes a notice--but the lad is kind.’
12683,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“I loved in summer on the heath to walk,"
12684,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And seek the shepherd--shepherds love to talk.
12685,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"His superstition was of ranker kind,"
12686,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And he with tales of wonder stored my mind;              430
12687,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Wonders that he in many a lonely eve
12688,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Had seen, himself, and therefore must believe."
12689,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"His boy, his Joe, he said, from duty ran,"
12690,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Took to the sea, and grew a fearless man:"
12691,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,‘On yonder knoll--the sheep were in the fold--
12692,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"His spirit past me, shivering-like and cold!"
12693,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I felt a fluttering, but I knew not how,"
12694,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And heard him utter, like a whisper, ‘now!’"
12695,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Soon came a letter from a friend--to tell
12696,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"That he had fallen, and the time he fell.’               440"
12697,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Even to the smugglers’ hut the rocks between,"
12698,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I have, adventurous in my wandering, been."
12699,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Poor, pious Martha served the lawless tribe,"
12700,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And could their merits and their faults describe;
12701,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Adding her thoughts; ‘I talk, my child, to you,"
12702,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Who little think of what such wretches do.’
12703,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“I loved to walk where none had walk’d before,"
12704,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,About the rocks that ran along the shore;
12705,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Or far beyond the sight of men to stray,"
12706,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And take my pleasure when I lost my way;                 450
12707,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"For then ’twas mine to trace the hilly heath,"
12708,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And all the mossy moor that lies beneath:
12709,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Here had I favourite stations, where I stood"
12710,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And heard the murmurs of the ocean-flood,"
12711,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"With not a sound beside, except when flew"
12712,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Aloft the lapwing, or the gray curlew,"
12713,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Who with wild notes my fancied power defied,"
12714,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And mock’d the dreams of solitary pride.
12715,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“I loved to stop at every creek and bay
12716,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Made by the river in its winding way,                    460"
12717,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And call to memory--not by marks they bare,"
12718,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,But by the thoughts that were created there.
12719,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,“Pleasant it was to view the sea-gulls strive
12720,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Against the storm, or in the ocean dive,"
12721,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"With eager scream, or when they dropping gave"
12722,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Their closing wings to sail upon the wave:
12723,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Then, as the winds and waters raged around,"
12724,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"And breaking billows mix’d their deafening sound,"
12725,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"They on the rolling deep securely hung,"
12726,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And calmly rode the restless waves among.                470
12727,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Nor pleased it less around me to behold,"
12728,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Far up the beach, the yesty sea-foam roll’d;"
12729,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Or, from the shore upborn, to see on high"
12730,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Its frothy flakes in wild confusion fly;
12731,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"While the salt spray that clashing billows form,"
12732,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Gave to the taste a feeling of the storm.
12733,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“Thus, with my favourite views, for many an hour"
12734,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Have I indulged the dreams of princely power;
12735,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"When the mind, weaned by excursions bold,"
12736,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"The fancy jaded, and the bosom cold,                     480"
12737,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Or when those wants that will on kings intrude,"
12738,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"Or evening-fears, broke in on solitude;"
12739,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"When I no more my fancy could employ,          }"
12740,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"I left in haste what I could not enjoy,        }"
12741,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,And was my gentle mother’s welcome boy.        }
12742,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"“But now thy walk,--this soft autumnal gloom"
12743,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,Bids no delay--at night I will resume
12744,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"My subject, showing, not how I improved"
12745,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"In my strange school, but what the things I loved,"
12746,_ADVENTURES OF RICHARD._,"My first-born friendships, ties by forms uncheck’d,      490"

12813,_RUTH._,A piece of Wingate--thanks for all we have--

12816,_RUTH._,"The ancient volume’s unassuming price,                    40"
12817,_RUTH._,"But told what planet o’er each herb had power,"
12818,_RUTH._,And how to take it in the lucky hour.
12819,_RUTH._,"“History we had--wars, treasons, treaties, crimes,"
12820,_RUTH._,From Julius Cæsar to the present times;
12821,_RUTH._,"Questions and answers, teaching what to ask"
12822,_RUTH._,"And what reply--a kind, laborious task;"
12823,_RUTH._,"A scholar’s book it was, who, giving, swore"
12824,_RUTH._,"It held the whole he wish’d to know, and more."
12825,_RUTH._,"“And we had poets, hymns and songs divine;"
12826,_RUTH._,"The most we read not, but allow’d them fine.              50"
12827,_RUTH._,"“Our tracts were many, on the boldest themes--"
12828,_RUTH._,"We had our metaphysics, spirits, dreams,"
12829,_RUTH._,"Visions and warnings, and portentous sights"
12830,_RUTH._,"Seen, though but dimly, in the doleful nights,"
12831,_RUTH._,"When the good wife her wintry vigil keeps,"
12832,_RUTH._,"And thinks alone of him at sea, and weeps."
12833,_RUTH._,"“Add to all these our works in single sheets,"
12834,_RUTH._,That our Cassandras sing about the streets.
12835,_RUTH._,"These, as I read, the grave good man would say,"
12836,_RUTH._,"‘Nay, Hannah!’ and she answer’d ‘What is Nay?             60"
12837,_RUTH._,"What is there, pray, so hurtful in a song?"
12838,_RUTH._,It is our fancy only makes it wrong;
12839,_RUTH._,"His purer mind no evil thoughts alarm,"
12840,_RUTH._,And innocence protects him like a charm.’
12841,_RUTH._,"Then would the matron, when the song had past,"
12842,_RUTH._,"And her laugh over, ask an hymn at last;"
12843,_RUTH._,"To the coarse jest she would attention lend,"
12844,_RUTH._,And to the pious psalm in reverence bend.
12845,_RUTH._,She gave her every power and all her mind
12846,_RUTH._,"As chance directed, or as taste inclined.                 70"
12847,_RUTH._,“More of our learning I will now omit:              }

12849,_RUTH._,"And all our works, rare fate, were to our genius fit. }"
12850,_RUTH._,"“When I had read, and we were weary grown"
12851,_RUTH._,"Of other minds, the dame disclosed her own;"

12855,_RUTH._,"“I could perceive, though Hannah bore full well"
12856,_RUTH._,"The ills of life, that few with her would dwell,          80"
12857,_RUTH._,"But pass away, like shadows o’er the plain"
12858,_RUTH._,"From flying clouds, and leave it fair again;"
12859,_RUTH._,"Still every evil, be it great or small,"
12860,_RUTH._,Would one past sorrow to the mind recal--
12861,_RUTH._,"The grand disease of life, to which she turns,"
12862,_RUTH._,And common cares and lighter suffering spurns.
12863,_RUTH._,"‘O! these are nothing,--they will never heed"

12865,_RUTH._,And have the wounds unclosed.’--I understood
12866,_RUTH._,"My hint to speak, and my design pursued,                  90"
12867,_RUTH._,"Curious the secret of that heart to find,          }"
12868,_RUTH._,"To mirth, to song, to laughter loud inclined,      }"
12869,_RUTH._,And yet to bear and feel a weight of grief behind. }
12870,_RUTH._,How does she thus her little sunshine throw
12871,_RUTH._,Always before her?--I should like to know.
12872,_RUTH._,"My friend perceived, and would no longer hide       }"
12873,_RUTH._,The bosom’s sorrow--Could she not confide           }
12874,_RUTH._,"In one who wept, unhurt--in one who felt, untried?  }"
12875,_RUTH._,"‘Dear child, I show you sins and sufferings strange,"
12876,_RUTH._,"But you, like Adam, must for knowledge change            100"
12877,_RUTH._,"That blissful ignorance: remember, then,"
12878,_RUTH._,What now you feel should be a check on men;
12879,_RUTH._,"For then your passions no debate allow,"
12880,_RUTH._,And therefore lay up resolution now.
12881,_RUTH._,"’Tis not enough, that when you can persuade"
12882,_RUTH._,"A maid to love, you know there’s promise made;"
12883,_RUTH._,"’Tis not enough, that you design to keep"
12884,_RUTH._,"That promise made, nor leave your lass to weep:"
12885,_RUTH._,"But you must guard yourself against the sin,"
12886,_RUTH._,And think it such to draw the party in;                  110
12887,_RUTH._,"Nay, the more weak and easy to be won,"
12888,_RUTH._,The viler you who have the mischief done.
12889,_RUTH._,"I am not angry, love; but men should know"
12890,_RUTH._,They cannot always pay the debt they owe
12891,_RUTH._,Their plighted honour; they may cause the ill
12892,_RUTH._,"They cannot lessen, though they feel a will;"
12893,_RUTH._,"For _he_ had truth with love, but love in youth"
12894,_RUTH._,"Does wrong, that cannot be repair’d by truth."
12895,_RUTH._,"Ruth--I may tell, too oft had she been told--"
12896,_RUTH._,"Was tall and fair, and comely to behold;                 120"
12897,_RUTH._,"Gentle and simple, in her native place"
12898,_RUTH._,Not one compared with her in form or face;
12899,_RUTH._,"She was not merry, but she gave our hearth"
12900,_RUTH._,A cheerful spirit that was more than mirth.
12901,_RUTH._,"There was a sailor boy, and people said"
12902,_RUTH._,"He was, as man, a likeness of the maid;"
12903,_RUTH._,"But not in this--for he was ever glad,"
12904,_RUTH._,"While Ruth was apprehensive, mild, and sad;"
12905,_RUTH._,"A quiet spirit hers, and peace would seek"
12906,_RUTH._,"In meditation--tender, mild, and meek!                 130"
12907,_RUTH._,"Her loved the lad most truly; and, in truth,"
12908,_RUTH._,She took an early liking to the youth;
12909,_RUTH._,"To her alone were his attentions paid,"
12910,_RUTH._,And they became the bachelor and maid.
12911,_RUTH._,He wish’d to marry; but so prudent we
12912,_RUTH._,"And worldly wise, we said it could not be."
12913,_RUTH._,They took the counsel--may be they approved--
12914,_RUTH._,"But still they grieved and waited, hoped and loved."
12915,_RUTH._,"Now, my young friend, when of such state I speak"
12916,_RUTH._,"As one of danger, you will be to seek:                 140"
12917,_RUTH._,"You know not, Richard, where the danger lies"
12918,_RUTH._,"In loving hearts, kind words, and speaking eyes;"
12919,_RUTH._,For lovers speak their wishes with their looks
12920,_RUTH._,"As plainly, love, as you can read your books."
12921,_RUTH._,"Then, too, the meetings and the partings, all"
12922,_RUTH._,"The playful quarrels in which lovers fall,"
12923,_RUTH._,"Serve to one end--each lover is a child,"
12924,_RUTH._,Quick to resent and to be reconciled;
12925,_RUTH._,"And then their peace brings kindness that remains,"
12926,_RUTH._,And so the lover from the quarrel gains.                 150
12927,_RUTH._,"When he has fault that she reproves, his fear"
12928,_RUTH._,And grief assure her she was too severe:
12929,_RUTH._,"And that brings kindness--when he bears an ill,  }"
12930,_RUTH._,"Or disappointment, and is calm and still,        }"
12931,_RUTH._,She feels his own obedient to her will:          }
12932,_RUTH._,And that brings kindness--and what kindness brings
12933,_RUTH._,I cannot tell you;--these were trying things.
12934,_RUTH._,"They were as children, and they fell at length;"
12935,_RUTH._,"The trial, doubtless, is beyond their strength"
12936,_RUTH._,Whom grace supports not; and will grace support          160
12937,_RUTH._,"The too confiding, who their danger court?"
12938,_RUTH._,Then they would marry--but were now too late--
12939,_RUTH._,All could their fault in sport or malice state;
12940,_RUTH._,"And though the day was fix’d, and now drew on,"
12941,_RUTH._,I could perceive my daughter’s peace was gone;
12942,_RUTH._,She could not bear the bold and laughing eye           }
12943,_RUTH._,That gazed on her--reproach she could not fly;         }
12944,_RUTH._,"Her grief she would not show, her shame could not deny;}"
12945,_RUTH._,"For some with many virtues come to shame,"
12946,_RUTH._,And some that lose them all preserve their name.         170
12947,_RUTH._,"“‘Fix’d was the day; but ere that day appear’d,"
12948,_RUTH._,A frightful rumour through the place was heard;
12949,_RUTH._,"War, who had slept awhile, awaked once more,"
12950,_RUTH._,And gangs came pressing till they swept the shore:
12951,_RUTH._,"Our youth was seized and quickly sent away,"
12952,_RUTH._,"Nor would the wretches for his marriage stay,"
12953,_RUTH._,"But bore him off, in barbarous triumph bore,"
12954,_RUTH._,And left us all our miseries to deplore.
12955,_RUTH._,"There were wives, maids, and mothers on the beach,"
12956,_RUTH._,And some sad story appertain’d to each;                  180
12957,_RUTH._,Most sad to Ruth--to neither could she go!
12958,_RUTH._,"But sat apart, and suffer’d matchless wo!"
12959,_RUTH._,"On the vile ship they turn’d their earnest view,    }"
12960,_RUTH._,"Not one last [look] allow’d,--not one adieu!        }"
12961,_RUTH._,"They saw the men on deck, but none distinctly knew. }"
12962,_RUTH._,"And there she staid, regardless of each eye,"
12963,_RUTH._,"With but one hope, a fervent hope to die."
12964,_RUTH._,Nor cared she now for kindness--all beheld
12965,_RUTH._,"Her, who invited none, and none repell’d;"
12966,_RUTH._,"For there are griefs, my child, that sufferers hide,     190"
12967,_RUTH._,And there are griefs that men display with pride;
12968,_RUTH._,"But there are other griefs that, so we feel,"
12969,_RUTH._,We care not to display them nor conceal:
12970,_RUTH._,"Such were our sorrows on that fatal day,"
12971,_RUTH._,More than our lives the spoilers tore away;
12972,_RUTH._,Nor did we heed their insult--some distress        }
12973,_RUTH._,"No form or manner can make more or less,           }"
12974,_RUTH._,And this is of that kind--this misery of a press!  }
12975,_RUTH._,‘They say such things must be--perhaps they must;
12976,_RUTH._,"But, sure, they need not fright us and disgust;          200"
12977,_RUTH._,They need not soul-less crews of ruffians send
12978,_RUTH._,At once the ties of humble love to rend.
12979,_RUTH._,"A single day had Thomas stay’d on shore,"
12980,_RUTH._,"He might have wedded, and we ask’d no more;"
12981,_RUTH._,"And that stern man, who forced the lad away,"
12982,_RUTH._,"Might have attended, and have graced the day;"
12983,_RUTH._,"His pride and honour might have been at rest,"
12984,_RUTH._,It is no stain to make a couple blest!
12985,_RUTH._,"Blest!--no, alas! it was to ease the heart"
12986,_RUTH._,"Of one sore pang, and then to weep and part!             210"
12987,_RUTH._,But this he would not.--English seamen fight
12988,_RUTH._,For England’s gain and glory--it is right;
12989,_RUTH._,"But will that public spirit be so strong,"
12990,_RUTH._,"Fill’d, as it must be, with their private wrong?"
12991,_RUTH._,"Forbid it, honour, one in all the fleet"
12992,_RUTH._,"Should hide in war, or from the foe retreat!"
12993,_RUTH._,"But is it just, that he who so defends"
12994,_RUTH._,"His country’s cause, should hide him from her friends?"
12995,_RUTH._,"Sure, if they must upon our children seize,"
12996,_RUTH._,They might prevent such injuries as these;             220
12997,_RUTH._,"Might hours--nay, days--in many a case allow,"
12998,_RUTH._,And soften all the griefs we suffer now.
12999,_RUTH._,"Some laws, some orders might in part redress"
13000,_RUTH._,"The licensed insults of a British press,"
13001,_RUTH._,"That keeps the honest and the brave in awe,"
13002,_RUTH._,"Where might is right, and violence is law."
13003,_RUTH._,"‘Be not alarm’d, my child; there’s none regard"
13004,_RUTH._,What you and I conceive so cruel-hard:
13005,_RUTH._,"There is compassion, I believe; but still"
13006,_RUTH._,"One wants the power to help, and one the will,           230"
13007,_RUTH._,"And so from war to war the wrongs remain,"
13008,_RUTH._,"While Reason pleads, and Misery sighs, in vain."
13009,_RUTH._,"‘Thus my poor Ruth was wretched and undone,"
13010,_RUTH._,"Nor had an husband for her only son,"
13011,_RUTH._,"Nor had he father; hope she did awhile,"
13012,_RUTH._,"And would not weep, although she could not smile;"
13013,_RUTH._,"Till news was brought us that the youth was slain,"
13014,_RUTH._,"And then, I think, she never smiled again;"
13015,_RUTH._,"Or if she did, it was but to express"
13016,_RUTH._,"A feeling far, indeed, from happiness!                   240"
13017,_RUTH._,"Something that her bewilder’d mind conceived,"
13018,_RUTH._,"When she inform’d us that she never grieved,"
13019,_RUTH._,"But was right merry, then her head was wild,"
13020,_RUTH._,And grief had gain’d possession of my child.
13021,_RUTH._,"Yet, though bewilder’d for a time, and prone"
13022,_RUTH._,"To ramble much and speak aloud, alone;"
13023,_RUTH._,Yet did she all that duty ever ask’d
13024,_RUTH._,"And more, her will self-govern’d and untask’d."
13025,_RUTH._,"With meekness bearing all reproach, all joy"
13026,_RUTH._,"To her was lost; she wept upon her boy,                  250"
13027,_RUTH._,"Wish’d for his death, in fear that he might live"
13028,_RUTH._,New sorrow to a burden’d heart to give.
13029,_RUTH._,"‘There was a teacher, where my husband went-- }"
13030,_RUTH._,"_Sent_, as he told the people--what he meant    }"
13031,_RUTH._,"You cannot understand, but--he was sent.        }"
13032,_RUTH._,"This man from meeting came, and strove to win"
13033,_RUTH._,"Her mind to peace by drawing off the sin,"
13034,_RUTH._,"Or what it was, that, working in her breast,"
13035,_RUTH._,"Robb’d it of comfort, confidence, and rest."
13036,_RUTH._,"He came and reason’d, and she seem’d to feel             260"
13037,_RUTH._,The pains he took--her griefs began to heal;
13038,_RUTH._,"She ever answer’d kindly when he spoke,"
13039,_RUTH._,And always thank’d him for the pains he took;
13040,_RUTH._,"So, after three long years, and all the while"
13041,_RUTH._,"Wrapt up in grief, she blest us with a smile,"
13042,_RUTH._,And spoke in comfort; but she mix’d no more
13043,_RUTH._,"With younger persons, as she did before."
13044,_RUTH._,‘Still Ruth was pretty; in her person neat;
13045,_RUTH._,"So thought the teacher, when they chanced to meet."
13046,_RUTH._,"He was a weaver by his worldly trade,                    270"
13047,_RUTH._,But powerful work in the assemblies made;
13048,_RUTH._,People came leagues to town to hear him sift
13049,_RUTH._,"The holy text,--he had the grace and gift;"
13050,_RUTH._,Widows and maidens flock’d to hear his voice;
13051,_RUTH._,Of either kind he might have had his choice;--
13052,_RUTH._,But he had chosen--we had seen how shy
13053,_RUTH._,"The girl was getting, my good man and I;"
13054,_RUTH._,"That when the weaver came, she kept with us,"
13055,_RUTH._,Where he his points and doctrines might discuss;
13056,_RUTH._,"But in our bit of garden, or the room                    280"
13057,_RUTH._,"We call our parlour, there he must not come."
13058,_RUTH._,"She loved him not, and though she could attend"
13059,_RUTH._,"To his discourses as her guide and friend,"
13060,_RUTH._,"Yet now to these she gave a listless ear,"
13061,_RUTH._,As if a friend she would no longer hear;
13062,_RUTH._,"This might he take for woman’s art, and cried,"
13063,_RUTH._,"‘Spouse of my heart, I must not be denied!’--"
13064,_RUTH._,"Fearless he spoke, and I had hope to see"
13065,_RUTH._,My girl a wife--but this was not to be.
13066,_RUTH._,"‘My husband, thinking of his worldly store,            290"
13067,_RUTH._,"And not, frail man, enduring to be poor,"
13068,_RUTH._,Seeing his friend would for his child provide
13069,_RUTH._,"And hers, he grieved to have the man denied;"
13070,_RUTH._,"For Ruth, when press‘d, rejected him, and grew"
13071,_RUTH._,"To her old sorrow, as if that were new."
13072,_RUTH._,"‘Who shall support her?’ said her father, ‘how"
13073,_RUTH._,"Can I, infirm and weak as I am now?"
13074,_RUTH._,And here a loving fool’----this gave her pain
13075,_RUTH._,"Severe, indeed, but she would not complain;"
13076,_RUTH._,"Nor would consent, although the weaver grew              300"
13077,_RUTH._,"More fond, and would the frighten’d girl pursue."
13078,_RUTH._,"‘O! much she begg’d him to forbear, to stand"
13079,_RUTH._,"Her soul’s kind friend, and not to ask her hand:"
13080,_RUTH._,"She could not love him.--‘Love me!’ he replied,"
13081,_RUTH._,"‘The love you mean is love unsanctified,"
13082,_RUTH._,"An earthly, wicked, sensual, sinful kind,"
13083,_RUTH._,"A creature-love, the passion of the blind.’"
13084,_RUTH._,"He did not court her, he would have her know,"
13085,_RUTH._,For that poor love that will on beauty grow;
13086,_RUTH._,No! he would take her as the prophet took                310
13087,_RUTH._,One of the harlots in the holy book;
13088,_RUTH._,And then he look’d so ugly and severe!
13089,_RUTH._,And yet so fond--she could not hide her fear.
13090,_RUTH._,This fondness grew her torment; she would fly
13091,_RUTH._,"In woman’s terror, if he came but nigh;"
13092,_RUTH._,"Nor could I wonder he should odious prove,"
13093,_RUTH._,So like a ghost that left a grave for love.
13094,_RUTH._,But still her father lent his cruel aid
13095,_RUTH._,"To the man’s hope, and she was more afraid:"
13096,_RUTH._,"He said, no more she should his table share,             320"
13097,_RUTH._,But be the parish or the teacher’s care.
13098,_RUTH._,‘Three days I give you: see that all be right      }
13099,_RUTH._,On Monday-morning--this is Thursday-night--        }
13100,_RUTH._,"Fulfil my wishes, girl! or else forsake my sight!’ }"
13101,_RUTH._,"‘I see her now; and, she that was so meek"
13102,_RUTH._,"It was a chance that she had power to speak,"
13103,_RUTH._,"Now spoke in earnest--‘Father! I obey,"
13104,_RUTH._,And will remember the appointed day!’
13105,_RUTH._,"‘Then came the man: she talk’d with him apart,"
13106,_RUTH._,"And, I believe, laid open all her heart;                 330"
13107,_RUTH._,"But all in vain--she said to me, in tears,"
13108,_RUTH._,‘Mother! that man is not what he appears:
13109,_RUTH._,"He talks of heaven, and let him, if he will,"
13110,_RUTH._,But he has earthly purpose to fulfil;
13111,_RUTH._,Upon my knees I begg’d him to resign
13112,_RUTH._,"The hand he asks--he said, ‘it shall be mine."
13113,_RUTH._,‘What! did the holy men of Scripture deign
13114,_RUTH._,To hear a woman when she said ‘refrain?’
13115,_RUTH._,"Of whom they chose they took them wives, and these"
13116,_RUTH._,Made it their study and their wish to please;            340
13117,_RUTH._,"The women then were faithful and afraid,"
13118,_RUTH._,"As Sarah Abraham, they their lords obey’d,"

13120,_RUTH._,"Of foolish love that we our women praise,"
13121,_RUTH._,"Fall on the knee, and raise the suppliant hand,"
13122,_RUTH._,And court the favour that we might command.’
13123,_RUTH._,"O! my dear mother, when this man has power,"
13124,_RUTH._,How will he treat me--first may beasts devour!
13125,_RUTH._,"Or death in every form that I could prove,"
13126,_RUTH._,Except this selfish being’s hateful love.’               350
13127,_RUTH._,"I gently blamed her, for I knew how hard"
13128,_RUTH._,It is to force affection and regard.
13129,_RUTH._,"Ah! my dear lad, I talk to you as one"
13130,_RUTH._,Who knew the misery of an heart undone;
13131,_RUTH._,"You know it not; but, dearest boy, when man,"
13132,_RUTH._,Do not an ill because you find you can.
13133,_RUTH._,"Where is the triumph? when such things men seek,"
13134,_RUTH._,They only drive to wickedness the weak.
13135,_RUTH._,"Weak was poor Ruth, and this good man so hard,"
13136,_RUTH._,That to her weakness he had no regard;                   360
13137,_RUTH._,"But we had two days peace; he came, and then"
13138,_RUTH._,"My daughter whisper’d, ‘Would there were no men!"
13139,_RUTH._,"None to admire or scorn us, none to vex"
13140,_RUTH._,"A simple, trusting, fond, believing sex;"
13141,_RUTH._,"Who truly love the worth that men profess,"
13142,_RUTH._,And think too kindly for their happiness.’
13143,_RUTH._,Poor Ruth! few heroines in the tragic page
13144,_RUTH._,Felt more than thee in thy contracted stage;
13145,_RUTH._,"Fair, fond, and virtuous, they our pity move,"
13146,_RUTH._,"Impell’d by duty, agonized by love;                      370"
13147,_RUTH._,"But no Mandane, who in dread has knelt"
13148,_RUTH._,"On the bare boards, has greater terrors felt,"
13149,_RUTH._,Nor been by warring passions more subdued
13150,_RUTH._,"Than thou, by this man’s groveling wish pursued;"

13152,_RUTH._,"Doom’d the chance mercy of the world to trust, }"
13153,_RUTH._,Or to wed grossness and conceal disgust.       }
13154,_RUTH._,"If Ruth was frail, she had a mind too nice"
13155,_RUTH._,To wed with that which she beheld as vice;
13156,_RUTH._,"To take a reptile, who, beneath a show                  380"
13157,_RUTH._,"Of peevish zeal, let carnal wishes grow;"
13158,_RUTH._,"Proud and yet mean, forbidding and yet full"
13159,_RUTH._,"Of eager appetites, devout and dull;"
13160,_RUTH._,Waiting a legal right that he might seize
13161,_RUTH._,"His own, and his impatient spirit ease;"
13162,_RUTH._,"Who would at once his pride and love indulge,"
13163,_RUTH._,"His temper humour, and his spite divulge."
13164,_RUTH._,"This the poor victim saw--a second time,"
13165,_RUTH._,"Sighing, she said, ‘Shall I commit the crime,"
13166,_RUTH._,And now untempted? Can the form or rite                 390
13167,_RUTH._,Make me a wife in my Creator’s sight?
13168,_RUTH._,Can I the words without a meaning say?
13169,_RUTH._,"Can I pronounce love, honour, or obey?"
13170,_RUTH._,"And if I cannot, shall I dare to wed,"
13171,_RUTH._,And go an harlot to a loathed bed?
13172,_RUTH._,"Never, dear mother! my poor boy and I"
13173,_RUTH._,Will at the mercy of a parish lie:
13174,_RUTH._,"Reproved for wants that vices would remove,"
13175,_RUTH._,"Reproach’d for vice that I could never love,"
13176,_RUTH._,"Mix’d with a crew long wedded to disgrace,        }     400"
13177,_RUTH._,"A Vulgar, forward, equalizing race--              }"
13178,_RUTH._,And am I doom’d to beg a dwelling in that place?’ }
13179,_RUTH._,Such was her reasoning: many times she weigh’d
13180,_RUTH._,"The evils all, and was of each afraid;"
13181,_RUTH._,"She loath’d the common board, the vulgar seat,           }"
13182,_RUTH._,"Where shame, and want, and vice, and sorrow meet,        }"
13183,_RUTH._,"Where frailty finds allies, where guilt insures retreat. }"
13184,_RUTH._,"But peace again is fled; the teacher comes,"
13185,_RUTH._,"And new importance, haughtier air assumes."
13186,_RUTH._,No hapless victim of a tyrant’s love                   410
13187,_RUTH._,"More keenly felt, or more resisting strove"
13188,_RUTH._,"Against her fate; she look’d on every side,"
13189,_RUTH._,"But there were none to help her, none to guide;--"
13190,_RUTH._,"And he, the man who should have taught the soul,"
13191,_RUTH._,Wish’d but the body in his base control.
13192,_RUTH._,"She left her infant on the Sunday morn,"
13193,_RUTH._,A creature doom’d to shame! in sorrow born;
13194,_RUTH._,"A thing that languished, nor arrived at age"
13195,_RUTH._,When the man’s thoughts with sin and pain engage--
13196,_RUTH._,"She came not home to share our humble meal,               420"
13197,_RUTH._,Her father thinking what his child would feel
13198,_RUTH._,From his hard sentence--still she came not home.
13199,_RUTH._,"The night grew dark, and yet she was not come;"
13200,_RUTH._,"The east-wind roar’d, the sea return’d the sound,"
13201,_RUTH._,And the rain fell as if the world were drown’d;
13202,_RUTH._,"There were no lights without, and my good man,"
13203,_RUTH._,"To kindness frighten’d, with a groan began"
13204,_RUTH._,"To talk of Ruth, and pray; and then he took"
13205,_RUTH._,"The Bible down, and read the holy book;"
13206,_RUTH._,For he had learning; and when that was done              430
13207,_RUTH._,We sat in silence--whither could we run?
13208,_RUTH._,"We said, and then rush’d frighten’d from the door,"
13209,_RUTH._,For we could bear our own conceit no more;
13210,_RUTH._,We call’d on neighbours--there she had not been;
13211,_RUTH._,We met some wanderers--ours they had not seen;
13212,_RUTH._,"We hurried o’er the beach, both north and south,"
13213,_RUTH._,"Then join’d, and wander’d to our haven’s mouth,"
13214,_RUTH._,Where rush’d the falling waters wildly out:
13215,_RUTH._,"I scarcely heard the good man’s fearful shout,"
13216,_RUTH._,"Who saw a something on the billow ride,                  440"
13217,_RUTH._,"And ‘Heaven have mercy on our sins!’ he cried,"
13218,_RUTH._,‘It is my child!’ and to the present hour
13219,_RUTH._,So he believes--and spirits have the power.
13220,_RUTH._,And she was gone! the waters wide and deep
13221,_RUTH._,Roll’d o’er her body as she lay asleep.
13222,_RUTH._,"She heard no more the angry waves and wind,"
13223,_RUTH._,She heard no more the threatening of mankind;
13224,_RUTH._,"Wrapt in dark weeds, the refuse of the storm,"
13225,_RUTH._,To the hard rock was borne her comely form!
13226,_RUTH._,"But O! what storm was in that mind? what strife,       450"
13227,_RUTH._,That could compel her to lay down her life?
13228,_RUTH._,"For she was seen within the sea to wade,"
13229,_RUTH._,"By one at distance, when she first had pray’d;"
13230,_RUTH._,Then to a rock within the hither shoal
13231,_RUTH._,Softly and with a fearful step she stole;
13232,_RUTH._,"Then, when she gain’d it, on the top she stood"
13233,_RUTH._,A moment still--and dropt into the flood!
13234,_RUTH._,"The man cried loudly, but he cried in vain--"
13235,_RUTH._,She heard not then--she never heard again!
13236,_RUTH._,"She had--pray, Heav’n!--she had that world in sight,     460"
13237,_RUTH._,"Where frailty mercy finds, and wrong has right;"
13238,_RUTH._,"But, sure, in this her portion such has been,"
13239,_RUTH._,Well had it still remain’d a world unseen!’
13240,_RUTH._,Thus far the dame: the passions will dispense
13241,_RUTH._,To such a wild and rapid eloquence--
13242,_RUTH._,"Will to the weakest mind their strength impart,"
13243,_RUTH._,And give the tongue the language of the heart.”

13685,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To speak the truth--does all this love remain,"
13686,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And all this joy? for views and flights sublime,"
13687,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Ardent and tender, are subdued by time."
13688,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Speakst thou of her to whom thou madest thy vows,"
13689,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of my fair sister, of thy lawful spouse?"
13690,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Or art thou talking some frail love about,"
13691,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The rambling fit, before th’ abiding gout?”"
13692,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Nay, spare me, Brother, an adorer spare:"
13693,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Love and the gout! thou wouldst not these compare?“       10
13694,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Yea, and correctly; teasing ere they come,"
13695,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,They then confine their victim to his home:
13696,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In both are previous feints and false attacks,"
13697,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Both place the grieving patient on their racks:
13698,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"They both are ours, with all they bring, for life,"
13699,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,’Tis not in us t’ expel or gout or wife;
13700,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"On man a kind of dignity they shed,"
13701,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,A sort of gloomy pomp about his bed;
13702,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then, if he leaves them, go where’er he will,"
13703,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,They have a claim upon his body still;                    20
13704,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Nay, when they quit him, as they sometimes do,"
13705,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,What is there left t’ enjoy or to pursue?--
13706,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,But dost thou love this woman?”
13707,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,“O! beyond
13708,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,What I can tell thee of the true and fond:
13709,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Hath she not soothed me, sick, enrich’d me, poor,"
13710,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And banish’d death and misery from my door?
13711,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Has she not cherish’d every moment’s bliss,"
13712,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And made an Eden of a world like this?
13713,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"When Care would strive with us his watch to keep,"
13714,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Has she not sung the snarling fiend to sleep?             30
13715,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And when Distress has look’d us in the face,"
13716,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Has she not told him, ‘thou art not Disgrace?’”"
13717,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“I must behold her, Richard; I must see"
13718,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,This patient spouse who sweetens misery--
13719,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But didst thou need, and wouldst thou not apply?--"
13720,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Nay thou wert right--but then how wrong was I!”
13721,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,“My indiscretion was----”
13722,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,“No more repeat;
13723,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Would I were nothing worse than indiscreet;--
13724,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But still there is a plea that I could bring,"
13725,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Had I the courage to describe the thing.”                 40
13726,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Then, thou too, Brother, couldst of weakness tell;"
13727,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Thou, too, hast found the wishes that rebel"
13728,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Against the sovereign reason; at some time
13729,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Thou hast been fond, heroic, and sublime;"
13730,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Wrote verse, it may be, and for one dear maid"
13731,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,The sober purposes of life delay’d;
13732,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"From year to year the fruitless chase pursued,"
13733,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And hung enamour’d o’er the flying good.
13734,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then, be thy weakness to a Brother shown,"
13735,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And give him comfort who displays his own.”               50

13739,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That on my spirit presses as a crime,"
13740,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Wilt thou despise me?--I, who, soaring, fell             }"
13741,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,So late to rise--Hear then the tale I tell;              }

13747,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Follies and frailties thou hast never known;
13748,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Thine was a frailty,--folly, if you please--             60"
13749,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But mine a flight, a madness, a disease."
13750,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Turn with me to my twentieth year, for then"
13751,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,The lover’s frenzy ruled the poet’s pen;
13752,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"When virgin reams were soil’d with lays of love,"
13753,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,The flinty hearts of fancied nymphs to move:
13754,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then was I pleased in lonely ways to tread,"
13755,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And muse on tragic tales of lovers dead;
13756,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,For all the merit I could then descry
13757,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,In man or woman was for love to die.
13758,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“I mused on charmers chaste, who pledged their truth,   70"
13759,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And left no more the once-accepted youth;
13760,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Though he disloyal, lost, diseased, became,"
13761,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,The widow’d turtle’s was a deathless flame.
13762,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"This faith, this feeling, gave my soul delight:"
13763,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Truth in the lady, ardour in the knight."
13764,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“I built me castles wondrous rich and rare,"
13765,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Few castle-builders could with me compare;
13766,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The hall, the palace, rose at my command,"
13767,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And these I fill’d with objects great and grand.
13768,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Virtues sublime, that nowhere else would live,            80"
13769,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Glory and pomp, that I alone could give;"
13770,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Trophies and thrones, by matchless valour gain’d,"
13771,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Faith unreproved, and chastity unstain’d;"
13772,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"With all that soothes the sense and charms the soul,"
13773,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Came at my call, and were in my control."
13774,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“And who was I? a slender youth and tall,"
13775,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In manner awkward, and with fortune small;"
13776,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"With visage pale; my motions quick and slow,"
13777,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That fall and rising in the spirits show;
13778,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,For none could more by outward signs express              90
13779,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,What wise men lock within the mind’s recess.
13780,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Had I a mirror set before my view,"
13781,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I might have seen what such a form could do;
13782,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Had I within the mirror truth beheld,"
13783,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I should have such presuming thoughts repell’d:
13784,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But, awkward as I was, without the grace"
13785,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That gives new beauty to a form or face,"
13786,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Still I expected friends most true to prove,"
13787,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And grateful, tender, warm, assiduous love."
13788,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Assured of this, that love’s delicious bond           100"
13789,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Would hold me ever faithful, ever fond,"
13790,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,It seem’d but just that I in love should find
13791,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,A kindred heart as constant and as kind.
13792,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Give me, I cried, a beauty: none on earth"
13793,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Of higher rank or nobler in her birth;
13794,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Pride of her race, her father’s hope and care,"
13795,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Yet meek as children of the cottage are;
13796,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Nursed in the court, and there by love pursued,"
13797,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But fond of peace, and blest in solitude;"
13798,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"By rivals honour’d, and by beauties praised,             110"
13799,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Yet all unconscious of the envy raised.
13800,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Suppose her this, and from attendants freed,"
13801,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To want my prowess in a time of need,"
13802,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,When safe and grateful she desires to show
13803,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"She feels the debt that she delights to owe,"
13804,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And loves the man who saved her in distress--
13805,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"So fancy will’d, nor would compound for less."
13806,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“This was my dream.--In some auspicious hour,"
13807,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In some sweet solitude, in some green bower,"
13808,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Whither my fate should lead me, there, unseen,           120"
13809,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I should behold my fancy’s gracious queen,"
13810,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Singing sweet song! that I should hear awhile,"
13811,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Then catch the transient glory of a smile;
13812,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then at her feet with trembling hope should kneel,"
13813,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Such as rapt saints and raptured lovers feel:
13814,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To watch the chaste unfoldings of her heart,"
13815,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In joy to meet, in agony to part,"
13816,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And then in tender song to soothe my grief,"
13817,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And hail, in glorious rhyme, my _Lady of the Leaf_."
13818,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“To dream these dreams I chose a woody scene,          130"
13819,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"My guardian-shade, the world and me between;"
13820,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"A green inclosure, where beside its bound"
13821,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"A thorny fence beset its beauties round,"
13822,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Save where some creature’s force had made a way
13823,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For me to pass, and in my kingdom stray."
13824,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Here then I stray’d, then sat me down to call,"
13825,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Just as I will’d, my shadowy subjects all!"
13826,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Fruits of all minds conceived on every coast--
13827,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Fay, witch, enchanter, devil, demon, ghost;"
13828,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And thus with knights and nymphs, in halls and bowers,   140"
13829,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In war and love, I pass’d unnumber’d hours."
13830,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Gross and substantial beings all forgot,               }"
13831,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Ideal glories beam’d around the spot,                  }"
13832,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And all that was, with me, of this poor world was not. }"
13833,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Yet in this world there was a single scene,"
13834,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That I allow’d with mine to intervene.
13835,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"This house, where never yet my feet had stray’d,"
13836,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I with respect and timid awe survey’d;
13837,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"With pleasing wonder I have oft-times stood,"
13838,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,To view these turrets rising o’er the wood;              150
13839,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"When fancy to the halls and chambers flew,"
13840,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Large, solemn, silent, that I must not view;"
13841,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The moat was then, and then o’er all the ground"
13842,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Tall elms and ancient oaks stretch’d far around;
13843,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And where the soil forbad the nobler race,"
13844,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Dwarf trees and humbler shrubs had found their place,"
13845,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Forbidding man in their close hold to go,"
13846,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Haw, gatter, holm, the service and the sloe;"
13847,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"With tangling weeds that at the bottom grew,"
13848,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And climbers all above their feathery branches threw.    160
13849,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Nor path of man or beast was there espied;              }
13850,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But there the birds of darkness loved to hide,          }"
13851,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The loathed toad to lodge, and speckled snake to glide. }"
13852,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“To me this hall, thus view’d in part, appear’d"
13853,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"A mansion vast. I wonder’d, and I fear’d."
13854,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"There as I wander’d, fancy’s forming eye"
13855,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Could gloomy cells and dungeons dark espy;
13856,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Winding through these, I caught th’ appalling sound     }"
13857,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of troubled souls, that guilty minds confound,          }"
13858,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Where murder made its way, and mischief stalk’d around. }"
13859,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Above the roof were raised the midnight storms,          171"
13860,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And the wild lights betray’d the shadowy forms.
13861,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“With all these flights and fancies, then so dear,"
13862,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I reach’d the birth-day of my twentieth year;
13863,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And in the evening of a day in June
13864,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Was singing--as I sang--some heavenly tune.
13865,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"My native tone, indeed, was harsh and hoarse,"
13866,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,But he who feels such powers can sing of course--
13867,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Is there a good on earth, or gift divine,"
13868,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That fancy cannot say, behold! ’tis mine?                180"
13869,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“So was I singing, when I saw descend"
13870,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,From this old seat a lady and her friend;
13871,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Downward they came with steady pace and slow,"
13872,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Arm link’d in arm, to bless my world below."
13873,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I knew not yet if they escaped, or chose"
13874,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Their own free way; if they had friends or foes--
13875,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But near to my dominion drew the pair,"
13876,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Link’d arm in arm, and walk’d, conversing, there."
13877,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“I saw them ere they came, myself unseen,"
13878,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,My lofty fence and thorny bound between--               190
13879,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And one alone, one matchless face I saw,"
13880,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And, though at distance, felt delight and awe:"
13881,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Fancy and truth adorn’d her; fancy gave
13882,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Much, but not all; truth help’d to make their slave."
13883,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For she was lovely, all was not the vain"
13884,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Or sickly homage of a fever’d brain;
13885,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"No! she had beauty, such as they admire"
13886,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Whose hope is earthly, and whose love desire;"
13887,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Imagination might her aid bestow,"
13888,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,But she had charms that only truth could show.           200
13889,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Their dress was such as well became the place,    }"
13890,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But one superior; hers the air, the grace,           }"
13891,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The condescending looks, that spoke the nobler race. }"
13892,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Slender she was and tall; her fairy-feet
13893,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Bore her right onward to my shady seat;
13894,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And O! I sigh’d that she would nobly dare
13895,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To come, nor let her friend th’ adventure share;"
13896,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But see how I in my dominion reign,"
13897,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And never wish to view the world again.
13898,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Thus was I musing, seeing with my eyes                210"
13899,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"These objects, with my mind her fantasies,"
13900,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And chiefly thinking--is this maid, divine"
13901,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"As she appears, to be this queen of mine?"
13902,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Have I from henceforth beauty in my view,"
13903,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Not airy all, but tangible and true?"
13904,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Here then I fix, here bound my vagrant views,"
13905,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And here devote my heart, my time, my muse."
13906,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“She saw not this, though ladies early trace"
13907,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Their beauty’s power, the glories of their face;"
13908,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Yet knew not this fair creature--could not know          220
13909,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That new-born love that I too soon must show!
13910,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And I was musing--how shall I begin?
13911,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"How make approach my unknown way to win,"
13912,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And to that heart, as yet untouch’d, make known"
13913,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The wound, the wish, the weakness of my own?"
13914,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Such is my part, but----Mercy! what alarm?"
13915,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Dare aught on earth that sovereign beauty harm?
13916,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Again--the shrieking charmers--how they rend
13917,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,The gentle air----The shriekers lack a friend--
13918,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"They are my princess and th’ attendant maid,             230"
13919,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In so much danger, and so much afraid!--"
13920,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,But whence the terror?--Let me haste and see       }
13921,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,What has befallen them who cannot flee--           }
13922,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Whence can the peril rise? What can that peril be? }
13923,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“It soon appear’d, that while this nymph divine"
13924,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Moved on, there met her rude uncivil kine,"
13925,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Who knew her not--the damsel was not there
13926,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Who kept them--all obedient--in her care;
13927,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Strangers they thus defied and held in scorn,"
13928,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And stood in threat’ning posture, hoof and horn;         240"
13929,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,While Susan--pail in hand--could stand the while
13930,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And prate with Daniel at a distant stile.
13931,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“As feeling prompted, to the place I ran,"
13932,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Resolved to save the maids and show the man.
13933,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Was each a cow like that which challenged Guy,  }"
13934,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I had resolved t’ attack it, and defy           }"
13935,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,In mortal combat! to repel or die!              }
13936,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That was no time to parley--or to say,"
13937,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I will protect you--fly in peace away!
13938,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Lo! yonder stile--but with an air of grace,              250"
13939,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"As I supposed, I pointed to the place."
13940,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“The fair ones took me at my sign, and flew,"
13941,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Each like a dove, and to the stile withdrew;"
13942,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Where safe, at distance, and from terrors free,"
13943,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,They turn’d to view my beastly foes and me.
13944,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“I now had time my business to behold,"
13945,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And did not like it--let the truth be told:
13946,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The cows, though cowards, yet in numbers strong,"
13947,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Like other mobs, by might defended wrong;"
13948,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In man’s own pathway fix’d, they seem’d disposed         260"
13949,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For hostile measure, and in order closed,"
13950,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then halted near me, as I judged, to treat,"
13951,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Before we came to triumph or defeat.
13952,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“I was in doubt: ’twas sore disgrace, I knew,"
13953,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To turn my back, and let the cows pursue;"
13954,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And should I rashly mortal strife begin,"
13955,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,’Twas all unknown who might the battle win;
13956,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And yet to wait, and neither fight nor fly,"
13957,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Would mirth create--I could not that deny;
13958,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"It look’d as if for safety I would treat,                270"
13959,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Nay, sue for peace--No! rather come defeat!"
13960,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"‘Look to me, loveliest of thy sex! and give"
13961,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"One cheering glance, and not a cow shall live;"
13962,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For lo! this iron bar, this strenuous arm,"
13963,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And those dear eyes to aid me as a charm.’
13964,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Say, goddess! Victory! say, on man or cow"
13965,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Meanest thou now to perch?--On neither now--
13966,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For, as I ponder’d, on their way appear’d"
13967,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,The Amazonian milker of the herd;
13968,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"These, at the wonted signals, made a stand,              280"
13969,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And woo’d the nymph of the relieving hand;
13970,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Nor heeded now the man, who felt relief"
13971,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of other kind, and not unmix’d with grief;"
13972,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For now he neither should his courage prove,"
13973,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Nor in his dying moments boast his love.
13974,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,“My sovereign beauty with amazement saw--
13975,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,So she declared--the horrid things in awe;
13976,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Well pleased, she witness’d what respect was paid"
13977,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"By such brute natures--Every cow afraid,"
13978,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And kept at distance by the powers of one,         }    290"
13979,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Who had to her a dangerous service done,           }"
13980,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That prudence had declined, that valour’s self     }"
13981,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,might shun.                          }
13982,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“So thought the maid, who now, beyond the stile,"
13983,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Received her champion with a gracious smile;
13984,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Who now had leisure on those charms to dwell,"
13985,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That he could never from his thought expel.
13986,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"There are, I know, to whom a lover seems,"
13987,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Praising his mistress, to relate his dreams;"
13988,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But, Richard, looks like those, that angel-face"
13989,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Could I no more in sister-angel trace;                  300
13990,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,O! it was more than fancy! it was more           }
13991,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Than in my darling views I saw before,           }"
13992,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"When I my idol made, and my allegiance swore.    }"
13993,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Henceforth ’twas bliss upon that face to dwell,"
13994,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Till every trace became indelible;
13995,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I bless’d the cause of that alarm, her fright,"
13996,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And all that gave me favour in her sight,"
13997,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Who then was kind and grateful, till my mind,"
13998,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Pleased and exulting, awe awhile resign’d."
13999,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For in the moment when she feels afraid,             }   310"
14000,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,How kindly speaks the condescending maid;            }
14001,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"She sees her danger near, she wants her lover’s aid. }"
14002,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"As fire electric, when discharged, will strike"
14003,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"All who receive it, and they feel alike,"
14004,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,So in the shock of danger and surprise
14005,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Our minds are struck, and mix, and sympathise."
14006,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“But danger dies, and distance comes between"
14007,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,My state and that of my all glorious queen;
14008,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Yet much was done--upon my mind a chain
14009,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Was strongly fix’d, and likely to remain;                320"
14010,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Listening, I grew enamour’d of the sound,"
14011,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And felt to her my very being bound;
14012,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I bless’d the scene, nor felt a power to move,"
14013,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Lost in the ecstacies of infant-love.
14014,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“She saw and smiled; the smile delight convey’d,"
14015,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"My love encouraged, and my act repaid."
14016,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,In that same smile I read the charmer meant
14017,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,To give her hero chaste encouragement;
14018,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"It spoke, as plainly as a smile can speak,"
14019,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"‘Seek whom you love, love freely whom you seek.’         330"
14020,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Thus, when the lovely witch had wrought her charm,"
14021,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"She took th’ attendant maiden by the arm,"
14022,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And left me fondly gazing, till no more"
14023,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I could the shade of that dear form explore;
14024,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then to my secret haunt I turn’d again,"
14025,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Fire in my heart, and fever in my brain;"
14026,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That face of her for ever in my view,               }"
14027,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Whom I was henceforth fated to pursue,              }"
14028,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,To hope I knew not what--small hope in what I knew. }
14029,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“O! my dear Richard, what a waste of time              340"
14030,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Gave I not thus to lunacy sublime;
14031,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"What days, months, years, (to useful purpose lost)"
14032,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Has not this dire infatuation cost?
14033,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To this fair vision I, a [bonded] slave,"
14034,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Time, duty, credit, honour, comfort, gave;"
14035,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Gave all--and waited for the glorious things
14036,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That hope expects, but fortune never brings."
14037,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Yet let me own, while I my fault reprove,"
14038,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,There is one blessing still affix’d to love--
14039,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To love like mine--for, as my soul it drew               350"
14040,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"From reason’s path, it shunn’d dishonour’s too;"
14041,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"It made my taste refined, my feelings nice,"
14042,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And placed an angel in the way of vice.
14043,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“This angel now, whom I no longer view’d,"
14044,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Far from this scene her destined way pursued;
14045,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"No more that mansion held a form so fair,"
14046,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"She was away, and beauty was not there."
14047,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Such, my dear Richard, was my early flame,"
14048,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,My youthful frenzy--give it either name;
14049,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"It was the withering bane of many a year,                360"
14050,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That past away in causeless hope and fear--
14051,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The hopes, the fears, that every dream could kill,"
14052,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Or make alive, and lead my passive will."
14053,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“At length I learnt one name my angel bore,"
14054,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And Rosabella I must now adore:
14055,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Yet knew but this--and not the favour’d place
14056,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That held the angel or th’ angelic race;
14057,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Nor where, admired, the sweet enchantress dwelt,"
14058,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But I had lost her--that, indeed, I felt."
14059,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Yet, would I say, she will at length be mine!         370"
14060,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Did ever hero hope or love resign?
14061,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Though men oppose, and fortune bids despair,        }"
14062,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"She will in time her mischief well repair,          }"
14063,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And I, at last, shall wed this fairest of the fair! }"
14064,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“My thrifty uncle, now return’d, began"
14065,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,To stir within me what remain’d of man;
14066,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"My powerful frenzy painted to the life,"
14067,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And ask’d me if I took a dream to wife?
14068,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Debate ensued, and, though not well content,"
14069,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Upon a visit to his house I went.                        380
14070,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"He, the most saving of mankind, had still"
14071,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Some kindred feeling; he would guide my will,"
14072,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And teach me wisdom--so affection wrought,"
14073,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That he to save me from destruction sought:
14074,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To him destruction, the most awful curse"
14075,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of misery’s children, was--an empty purse!"
14076,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"He his own books approved, and thought the pen"
14077,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,An useful instrument for trading men;
14078,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,But judged a quill was never to be slit
14079,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Except to make it for a merchant fit.                    390
14080,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"He, when inform’d how men of taste could write,"
14081,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Look’d on his ledger with supreme delight;
14082,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then would he laugh, and, with insulting joy,"
14083,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Tell me aloud, ‘that’s poetry, my boy;"
14084,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"These are your golden numbers--them repeat,              }"
14085,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The more you have, the more you’ll find them sweet--     }"
14086,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Their numbers move all hearts--no matter for their feet. }
14087,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Sir, when a man composes in this style,"
14088,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,What is to him a critic’s frown or smile?
14089,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,What is the puppy’s censure or applause                  400
14090,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"To the good man who on his banker draws,"
14091,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Buys an estate, and writes upon the grounds,"
14092,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,‘Pay to A. B. an hundred thousand pounds?’
14093,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Thus, my dear nephew, thus your talents prove;"
14094,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Leave verse to poets, and the poor to love.’"
14095,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Some months I suffered thus, compell’d to sit"
14096,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And hear a wealthy kinsman aim at wit;
14097,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Yet there was something in his nature good,"
14098,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And he had feeling for the tie of blood.
14099,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"So, while I languish’d for my absent maid                410"
14100,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I some observance to my uncle paid.”
14101,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,“Had you inquired?” said Richard.
14102,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,“I had placed
14103,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Inquirers round, but nothing could be traced;"
14104,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of every reasoning creature at this Hall,"
14105,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And tenant near it, I applied to all----"
14106,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,‘Tell me if she’--and I described her well--
14107,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"‘Dwelt long a guest, or where retired to dwell?’"
14108,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,But no! such lady they remember’d not--
14109,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"They saw that face, strange beings! and forgot."
14110,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Nor was inquiry all; but I pursued                       420
14111,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"My soul’s first wish, with hope’s vast strength endued:"
14112,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I cross’d the seas, I went where strangers go,"
14113,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And gazed on crowds as one who dreads a foe,"
14114,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Or seeks a friend; and, when I sought in vain,"
14115,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Fled to fresh crowds, and hoped, and gazed again.”"
14116,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“It was a strong possession”--“Strong and strange,"
14117,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I felt the evil, yet desired not change."
14118,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Years now had flown, nor was the passion cured,"
14119,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But hope had life, and so was life endured;"
14120,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The mind’s disease, with all its strength, stole on,     430"
14121,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Till youth, and health, and all but love were gone."
14122,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And there were seasons, Richard, horrid hours"
14123,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of mental suffering! they o’erthrew my powers,"
14124,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And made my mind unsteady--I have still,"
14125,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"At times, a feeling of that nameless ill,"
14126,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,That is not madness--I could always tell
14127,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,My mind was wandering--knew it was not well;
14128,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Felt all my loss of time, the shameful waste"
14129,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of talents perish’d, and of parts disgraced."
14130,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But though my mind was sane, there was a void--         440"
14131,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,My understanding seem’d in part destroy’d;
14132,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I thought I was not of my species one,"
14133,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But unconnected, injured and undone!"
14134,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“While in this state, once more my uncle pray’d"
14135,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That I would hear--I heard, and I obey’d;"
14136,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,For I was thankful that a being broke
14137,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"On this my sadness, or an interest took"
14138,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In my poor life--but, at his mansion, rest"
14139,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Came with its halcyon stillness to my breast.
14140,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Slowly there enter’d in my mind concern                  450
14141,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For things about me--I would something learn,"
14142,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And to my uncle listen; who, with joy,"
14143,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Found that ev’n yet I could my powers employ,"
14144,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Till I could feel new hopes my mind possess,"
14145,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of ease at least, if not of happiness;"
14146,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Till, not contented, not in discontent,"
14147,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"As my good uncle counsell’d, on I went;"
14148,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Conscious of youth’s great error--nay, the crime"
14149,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Of manhood now--a dreary waste of time!
14150,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Conscious of that account which I must give              460
14151,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,How life had past with me--I strove to live.
14152,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Had I, like others, my first hope attain’d,"
14153,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I must, at least, a certainty have gain’d;"
14154,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Had I, like others, lost the hope of youth,"
14155,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Another hope had promised greater truth;
14156,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But I in baseless hopes, and groundless views,"
14157,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Was fated time, and peace, and health to lose,"
14158,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Impell’d to seek, for ever doom’d to fail,"
14159,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Is----I distress you--let me end my tale.
14160,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,“Something one day occurr’d about a bill               470
14161,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That was not drawn with true mercantile skill,"
14162,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And I was ask’d and authorized to go
14163,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,To seek the firm of Clutterbuck and Co.;
14164,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Their hour was past--but when I urged the case,"
14165,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,There was a youth who named a second place;
14166,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Where, on occasions of important kind,"
14167,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,I might the man of occupation find
14168,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"In his retirement, where he found repose"
14169,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,From the vexations that in business rose.
14170,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I found, though not with ease, this private seat         480"
14171,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of soothing quiet, wisdom’s still retreat."
14172,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“The house was good, but not so pure and clean"
14173,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,As I had houses of retirement seen;
14174,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Yet men, I knew, of meditation deep,"
14175,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Love not their maidens should their studies sweep;
14176,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"His room I saw, and must acknowledge, there"
14177,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Were not the signs of cleanliness or care:
14178,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"A female servant, void of female grace,"
14179,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Loose in attire, proceeded to the place;"
14180,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"She stared intrusive on my slender frame,                490"
14181,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And boldly ask’d my business and my name.
14182,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“I gave them both; and, left to be amused,"
14183,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Well as I might, the parlour I perused."
14184,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The shutters half unclosed, the curtains fell     }"
14185,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Half down, and rested on the window-sill,         }"
14186,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And thus, confusedly, made the room half visible. }"
14187,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Late as it was, the little parlour bore"
14188,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Some tell-tale tokens of the night before;
14189,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"There were strange sights and scents about the room,"
14190,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Of food high-season’d, and of strong perfume;          500"
14191,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Two unmatch’d sofas ample rents display’d;
14192,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Carpet and curtains were alike decay’d;
14193,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"A large old mirror, with once-gilded frame,"
14194,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Reflected prints that I forbear to name,"
14195,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Such as a youth might purchase--but, in truth,"
14196,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Not a sedate or sober-minded youth;
14197,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The cinders yet were sleeping in the grate,        }"
14198,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Warm from the fire, continued large and late,      }"
14199,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,As left by careless folk in their neglected state; }
14200,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The chairs in haste seem’d whirl’d about the room,   }  510"
14201,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"As when the sons of riot hurry home,                 }"
14202,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And leave the troubled place to solitude and gloom.  }
14203,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“All this, for I had ample time, I saw,"
14204,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,And prudence question’d--should we not withdraw?
14205,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For he who makes me thus on business wait,"
14206,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Is not for business in a proper state;
14207,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But man there was not, was not he for whom"
14208,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,To this convenient lodging I was come;
14209,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,No! but a lady’s voice was heard to call
14210,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,On my attention--and she had it all;                     520
14211,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"For lo! she enters, speaking ere in sight,"
14212,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,‘Monsieur! I shall not want the chair to-night--
14213,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Where shall I see him?--This dear hour atones
14214,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,For all affection’s hopeless sighs and groans’--
14215,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Then, turning to me--‘Art thou come at last?"

14507,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Who loves that interest solely to pursue.
14508,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“But I was sick, and sickness brought disgust;         810"
14509,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,My peace I could not to my profits trust:
14510,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Again some views of brighter kind appear’d,"
14511,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"My heart was humbled, and my mind was clear’d;"
14512,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"I felt those helps that souls diseased restore,"
14513,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And that cold frenzy, avarice, raged no more."
14514,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,From dreams of boundless wealth I then arose;    }
14515,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"This place, the scene of infant bliss, I chose;  }"
14516,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"And here I find relief, and here I seek repose.  }"
14517,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"“Yet much is lost, and not yet much is found,"
14518,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But what remains, I would believe, is sound:             820"
14519,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"That first wild passion, that last mean desire,"
14520,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Are felt no more; but holier hopes require
14521,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,A mind prepared and steady--my reform
14522,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Has fears like his, who, suffering in a storm,"
14523,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"Is on a rich but unknown country cast,"
14524,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"The future fearing, while he feels the past;"
14525,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,"But whose more cheerful mind, with hope imbued,"
14526,_THE ELDER BROTHER._,Sees through receding clouds the rising good.”

14551,_THE SISTERS._,
14552,_THE SISTERS._,The morning shone in cloudless beauty bright;
14553,_THE SISTERS._,Richard his letters read with much delight;
14554,_THE SISTERS._,"George from his pillow rose in happy tone,"
14555,_THE SISTERS._,His bosom’s lord sat lightly on his throne.
14556,_THE SISTERS._,They read the morning news--they saw the sky
14557,_THE SISTERS._,"Inviting call’d them, and the earth was dry."
14558,_THE SISTERS._,"“The day invites us, brother,” said the ’squire;"
14559,_THE SISTERS._,"“Come, and I’ll show thee something to admire:"
14560,_THE SISTERS._,We still may beauty in our prospects trace;
14561,_THE SISTERS._,"If not, we have them in both mind and face.               10"
14562,_THE SISTERS._,“’Tis but two miles--to let such women live
14563,_THE SISTERS._,"Unseen of him, what reason can I give?"
14564,_THE SISTERS._,Why should not Richard to the girls be known?
14565,_THE SISTERS._,Would I have all their friendship for my own?--
14566,_THE SISTERS._,"Brother, there dwell, yon northern hill below,"
14567,_THE SISTERS._,"Two favourite maidens, whom ’tis good to know;"
14568,_THE SISTERS._,"Young, but experienced; dwellers in a cot,"
14569,_THE SISTERS._,Where they sustain and dignify their lot;
14570,_THE SISTERS._,The best good girls in all our world below--
14571,_THE SISTERS._,O! you must know them--Come! and you shall know.          20
14572,_THE SISTERS._,"“But lo! the morning wastes--here, Jacob, stir--"
14573,_THE SISTERS._,"If Phœbe comes, do you attend to her;"
14574,_THE SISTERS._,And let not Mary get a chattering press
14575,_THE SISTERS._,Of idle girls to hear of her distress.
14576,_THE SISTERS._,Ask her to wait till my return--and hide
14577,_THE SISTERS._,From her meek mind your plenty and your pride;
14578,_THE SISTERS._,"Nor vex a creature, humble, sad, and still,"
14579,_THE SISTERS._,"By your coarse bounty, and your rude good-will.”"
14580,_THE SISTERS._,"This said, the brothers hasten’d on their way,"
14581,_THE SISTERS._,With all the foretaste of a pleasant day.                 30
14582,_THE SISTERS._,The morning purpose in the mind had fix’d
14583,_THE SISTERS._,"The leading thought, and that with others mix’d."
14584,_THE SISTERS._,"“How well it is,” said George, “when we possess"
14585,_THE SISTERS._,The strength that bears us up in our distress;
14586,_THE SISTERS._,"And need not the resources of our pride,"
14587,_THE SISTERS._,Our fall from greatness and our wants to hide;
14588,_THE SISTERS._,"But have the spirit and the wish to show,"
14589,_THE SISTERS._,We know our wants as well as others know.
14590,_THE SISTERS._,"’Tis true, the rapid turns of fortune’s wheel"
14591,_THE SISTERS._,Make even the virtuous and the humble feel:               40
14592,_THE SISTERS._,"They for a time must suffer, and but few"
14593,_THE SISTERS._,Can bear their sorrows and our pity too.
14594,_THE SISTERS._,"“Hence all these small expedients, day by day,"
14595,_THE SISTERS._,Are used to hide the evils they betray:
14596,_THE SISTERS._,"When, if our pity chances to be seen,                }"
14597,_THE SISTERS._,"The wounded pride retorts, with anger keen,          }"
14598,_THE SISTERS._,And man’s insulted grief takes refuge in his spleen. }
14599,_THE SISTERS._,"“When Timon’s board contains a single dish,"
14600,_THE SISTERS._,"Timon talks much of market-men and fish,"
14601,_THE SISTERS._,"Forgetful servants, and th’ infernal cook,                50"
14602,_THE SISTERS._,Who always spoil’d whate’er she undertook.
14603,_THE SISTERS._,"“But say it tries us from our height to fall,"
14604,_THE SISTERS._,Yet is not life itself a trial all?
14605,_THE SISTERS._,"And not a virtue in the bosom lives,"
14606,_THE SISTERS._,That gives such ready pay as patience gives;
14607,_THE SISTERS._,"That pure submission to the ruling mind,"
14608,_THE SISTERS._,"Fix’d, but not forced; obedient, but not blind,"
14609,_THE SISTERS._,"The will of heaven to make her own she tries,"
14610,_THE SISTERS._,Or makes her own to heaven a sacrifice.
14611,_THE SISTERS._,"“And is there aught on earth so rich or rare,           60"
14612,_THE SISTERS._,Whose pleasures may with virtue’s pains compare?
14613,_THE SISTERS._,"This fruit of patience, this the pure delight"
14614,_THE SISTERS._,That ’tis a trial in her Judge’s sight;
14615,_THE SISTERS._,"Her part still striving duty to sustain,"
14616,_THE SISTERS._,"Not spurning pleasure, not defying pain;"
14617,_THE SISTERS._,"Never in triumph till her race be won,"
14618,_THE SISTERS._,And never fainting till her work be done.”
14619,_THE SISTERS._,"With thoughts like these they reach’d the village brook,"
14620,_THE SISTERS._,And saw a lady sitting with her book;
14621,_THE SISTERS._,"And so engaged she heard not, till the men                70"
14622,_THE SISTERS._,"Were at her side, nor was she frighten’d then;"
14623,_THE SISTERS._,"But to her friend, the ’squire, his smile return’d,"
14624,_THE SISTERS._,Through which the latent sadness he discern’d.
14625,_THE SISTERS._,The stranger-brother at the cottage door
14626,_THE SISTERS._,"Was now admitted, and was strange no more;"
14627,_THE SISTERS._,"Then of an absent sister he was told,"
14628,_THE SISTERS._,Whom they were not at present to behold;
14629,_THE SISTERS._,"Something was said of nerves, and that disease,"
14630,_THE SISTERS._,"Whose varying powers on mind and body seize,"
14631,_THE SISTERS._,Enfeebling both!--Here chose they to remain               80
14632,_THE SISTERS._,"One hour in peace, and then return’d again."
14633,_THE SISTERS._,"“I know not why,” said Richard, “but I feel"
14634,_THE SISTERS._,The warmest pity on my bosom steal
14635,_THE SISTERS._,For that dear maid! How well her looks express
14636,_THE SISTERS._,For this world’s good a cherish’d hopelessness!
14637,_THE SISTERS._,"A resignation that is so entire,"
14638,_THE SISTERS._,It feels not now the stirrings of desire;
14639,_THE SISTERS._,What now to her is all the world esteems?
14640,_THE SISTERS._,"She is awake, and cares not for its dreams;"
14641,_THE SISTERS._,"But moves while yet on earth, as one above             90"
14642,_THE SISTERS._,Its hopes and fears--it[s] loathing and its love.
14643,_THE SISTERS._,"“But shall I learn,” said he, “these sisters’ fate?”--"
14644,_THE SISTERS._,And found his brother willing to relate.
14645,_THE SISTERS._,
14646,_THE SISTERS._,*       *       *       *       *
14647,_THE SISTERS._,
14648,_THE SISTERS._,"“The girls were orphans early; yet I saw,"
14649,_THE SISTERS._,"When young, their father--his profession law;"
14650,_THE SISTERS._,"He left them but a competence, a store"
14651,_THE SISTERS._,That made his daughters neither rich nor poor;
14652,_THE SISTERS._,"Not rich, compared with some who dwelt around;"
14653,_THE SISTERS._,"Not poor, for want they neither fear’d nor found;"
14654,_THE SISTERS._,"Their guardian uncle was both kind and just,             100"
14655,_THE SISTERS._,One whom a parent might in dying trust;
14656,_THE SISTERS._,"Who, in their youth, the trusted store improved,"
14657,_THE SISTERS._,"And, when he ceased to guide them, fondly loved."
14658,_THE SISTERS._,“These sister beauties were in fact the grace
14659,_THE SISTERS._,"Of yon small town,--it was their native place;"
14660,_THE SISTERS._,"Like Saul’s famed daughters were the lovely twain,"
14661,_THE SISTERS._,"As Micah, Lucy, and as Merab, Jane:"
14662,_THE SISTERS._,"For this was tall, with free commanding air,"
14663,_THE SISTERS._,"And that was mild, and delicate, and fair."
14664,_THE SISTERS._,"“Jane had an arch delusive smile, that charm’d         110"
14665,_THE SISTERS._,"And threaten’d too; alluring, it alarm’d;"
14666,_THE SISTERS._,"The smile of Lucy her approval told,"
14667,_THE SISTERS._,"Cheerful, not changing; neither kind nor cold."
14668,_THE SISTERS._,"“When children, Lucy love alone possess’d,"
14669,_THE SISTERS._,Jane was more punished and was more caress’d;
14670,_THE SISTERS._,"If told the childish wishes, one bespoke"
14671,_THE SISTERS._,"A lamb, a bird, a garden, and a brook;"
14672,_THE SISTERS._,"The other wish’d a joy unknown, a rout"
14673,_THE SISTERS._,"Or crowded ball, and to be first led out."
14674,_THE SISTERS._,"“Lucy loved all that grew upon the ground,             120"
14675,_THE SISTERS._,And loveliness in all things living found;
14676,_THE SISTERS._,"The gilded fly, the fern upon the wall,"
14677,_THE SISTERS._,"Were nature’s works, and admirable all;"
14678,_THE SISTERS._,"Pleased with indulgence of so cheap a kind,"
14679,_THE SISTERS._,Its cheapness never discomposed her mind.
14680,_THE SISTERS._,"“Jane had no liking for such things as these,"
14681,_THE SISTERS._,Things pleasing her must her superiors please;
14682,_THE SISTERS._,"The costly flower was precious in her eyes,"
14683,_THE SISTERS._,"That skill can vary, or that money buys;"
14684,_THE SISTERS._,"Her taste was good, but she was still afraid,            130"
14685,_THE SISTERS._,Till fashion sanction’d the remarks she made.
14686,_THE SISTERS._,"“The sisters read, and Jane with some delight,"
14687,_THE SISTERS._,"The satires keen that fear or rage excite,"
14688,_THE SISTERS._,"That men in power attack, and ladies high,"
14689,_THE SISTERS._,And give broad hints that we may know them by.
14690,_THE SISTERS._,"She was amused when sent to haunted rooms,"
14691,_THE SISTERS._,Or some dark passage where the spirit comes
14692,_THE SISTERS._,"Of one once murder’d! then she laughing read,"
14693,_THE SISTERS._,And felt at once the folly and the dread.
14694,_THE SISTERS._,"As rustic girls to crafty gipsies fly,                   140"
14695,_THE SISTERS._,"And trust the liar though they fear the lie,"
14696,_THE SISTERS._,"Or as a patient, urged by grievous pains,"
14697,_THE SISTERS._,Will fee the daring quack whom he disdains:
14698,_THE SISTERS._,"So Jane was pleased to see the beckoning hand,"
14699,_THE SISTERS._,And trust the magic of the Ratcliffe-wand.
14700,_THE SISTERS._,"“In her religion--for her mind, though light,"
14701,_THE SISTERS._,Was not disposed our better views to slight--
14702,_THE SISTERS._,"Her favourite authors were a solemn kind,"
14703,_THE SISTERS._,Who fill with dark mysterious thoughts the mind;
14704,_THE SISTERS._,"And who with such conceits her fancy plied,              150"
14705,_THE SISTERS._,"Became her friend, philosopher, and guide."
14706,_THE SISTERS._,“She made the Progress of the Pilgrim one
14707,_THE SISTERS._,To build a thousand pleasant views upon;
14708,_THE SISTERS._,All that connects us with a world above
14709,_THE SISTERS._,"She loved to fancy, and she long’d to prove;"
14710,_THE SISTERS._,"Well would the poet please her, who could lead"
14711,_THE SISTERS._,"Her fancy forth, yet keep untouch’d her creed."
14712,_THE SISTERS._,"“Led by an early custom, Lucy spied,"
14713,_THE SISTERS._,"When she awaked, the Bible at her side;"
14714,_THE SISTERS._,"That, ere she ventured on a world of care,        }      160"
14715,_THE SISTERS._,"She might for trials, joys or pains prepare,      }"
14716,_THE SISTERS._,"For every dart a shield, a guard for every snare. }"
14717,_THE SISTERS._,"“She read not much of high heroic deeds,"
14718,_THE SISTERS._,Where man the measure of man’s power exceeds;
14719,_THE SISTERS._,But gave to luckless love and fate severe
14720,_THE SISTERS._,Her tenderest pity and her softest tear.
14721,_THE SISTERS._,"“She mix’d not faith with fable, but she trod"
14722,_THE SISTERS._,"Right onward, cautious in the ways of God;"
14723,_THE SISTERS._,"Nor did she dare to launch on seas unknown,          }"
14724,_THE SISTERS._,"In search of truths by some adventurers shown,       }   170"
14725,_THE SISTERS._,"But her own compass used, and kept a course her own. }"
14726,_THE SISTERS._,"“The maidens both their loyalty declared,"
14727,_THE SISTERS._,And in the glory of their country shared;
14728,_THE SISTERS._,"But Jane that glory felt with proud delight,"
14729,_THE SISTERS._,When England’s foes were vanquish’d in the fight;
14730,_THE SISTERS._,While Lucy’s feelings for the brave who bled
14731,_THE SISTERS._,Put all such glorious triumphs from her head.
14732,_THE SISTERS._,“They both were frugal; Lucy from the fear
14733,_THE SISTERS._,"Of wasting that which want esteems so dear,"
14734,_THE SISTERS._,"But finds so scarce, her sister from the pain            180"
14735,_THE SISTERS._,"That springs from want, when treated with disdain."
14736,_THE SISTERS._,"“Jane borrow’d maxims from a doubting school,"
14737,_THE SISTERS._,And took for truth the test of ridicule;
14738,_THE SISTERS._,Lucy saw no such virtue in a jest:
14739,_THE SISTERS._,Truth was with her of ridicule a test.
14740,_THE SISTERS._,"“They loved each other with the warmth of youth,"
14741,_THE SISTERS._,"With ardour, candour, tenderness, and truth;"
14742,_THE SISTERS._,"And, though their pleasures were not just the same,"
14743,_THE SISTERS._,Yet both were pleased whenever one became;
14744,_THE SISTERS._,"Nay, each would rather in the act rejoice,               190"
14745,_THE SISTERS._,"That was th’ adopted, not the native choice."
14746,_THE SISTERS._,"“Each had a friend, and friends to minds so fond"
14747,_THE SISTERS._,And good are soon united in the bond;
14748,_THE SISTERS._,Each had a lover; but it seem’d that fate
14749,_THE SISTERS._,Decreed that these should not approximate.
14750,_THE SISTERS._,"Now Lucy’s lover was a prudent swain,"
14751,_THE SISTERS._,"And thought, in all things, what would be his gain;"
14752,_THE SISTERS._,"The younger sister first engaged his view,"
14753,_THE SISTERS._,But with her beauty he her spirit knew;
14754,_THE SISTERS._,"Her face he much admired, ‘but, put the case,’           200"
14755,_THE SISTERS._,"Said he, ‘I marry, what is then a face?"
14756,_THE SISTERS._,At first it pleases to have drawn the lot;
14757,_THE SISTERS._,"He then forgets it, but his wife does not;"
14758,_THE SISTERS._,"Jane too,’ he judged, ‘would be reserved and nice,"
14759,_THE SISTERS._,And many lovers had enhanced her price.’
14760,_THE SISTERS._,"“Thus thinking much, but hiding what he thought,"
14761,_THE SISTERS._,"The prudent lover Lucy’s favour sought,"
14762,_THE SISTERS._,"And he succeeded--she was free from art,"
14763,_THE SISTERS._,And his appear’d a gentle guileless heart;
14764,_THE SISTERS._,"Such she respected; true, her sister found               210"
14765,_THE SISTERS._,"His placid face too ruddy and too round,"
14766,_THE SISTERS._,Too cold and inexpressive; such a face
14767,_THE SISTERS._,Where you could nothing mark’d or manly trace.
14768,_THE SISTERS._,"“But Lucy found him to his mother kind,"
14769,_THE SISTERS._,And saw the Christian meekness of his mind;
14770,_THE SISTERS._,"His voice was soft, his temper mild and sweet,"
14771,_THE SISTERS._,"His mind was easy, and his person neat."
14772,_THE SISTERS._,“Jane said he wanted courage; Lucy drew
14773,_THE SISTERS._,"No ill from that, though she believed it too;"
14774,_THE SISTERS._,"‘It is religious, Jane, be not severe;’                  220"
14775,_THE SISTERS._,"‘Well, Lucy, then it is religious fear,’"
14776,_THE SISTERS._,"Nor could the sister, great as was her love,"
14777,_THE SISTERS._,A man so lifeless and so cool approve.
14778,_THE SISTERS._,"“Jane had a lover, whom a lady’s pride"
14779,_THE SISTERS._,"Might wish to see attending at her side,"
14780,_THE SISTERS._,"Young, handsome, sprightly, and with good address,"
14781,_THE SISTERS._,"Not mark’d for folly, error or excess;"
14782,_THE SISTERS._,Yet not entirely from their censure free
14783,_THE SISTERS._,Who judge our failings with severity.
14784,_THE SISTERS._,The very care he took to keep his name                   230
14785,_THE SISTERS._,"Stainless, with some was evidence of shame."
14786,_THE SISTERS._,"“Jane heard of this, and she replied, ‘Enough;"
14787,_THE SISTERS._,"Prove but the facts, and I resist not proof;"
14788,_THE SISTERS._,Nor is my heart so easy as to love
14789,_THE SISTERS._,The man my judgment bids me not approve.’
14790,_THE SISTERS._,"But yet that heart a secret joy confess’d,"
14791,_THE SISTERS._,To find no slander on the youth would rest;
14792,_THE SISTERS._,"His was, in fact, such conduct, that a maid"
14793,_THE SISTERS._,"Might think of marriage, and be not afraid;"
14794,_THE SISTERS._,"And she was pleased to find a spirit high,               240"
14795,_THE SISTERS._,"Free from all fear, that spurn’d hypocrisy."
14796,_THE SISTERS._,"“‘What fears my sister?’ said the partial fair,"
14797,_THE SISTERS._,"For Lucy fear’d,--‘Why tell me to beware?"
14798,_THE SISTERS._,No smooth deceitful varnish can I find;               }
14799,_THE SISTERS._,"His is a spirit generous, free, and kind;             }"
14800,_THE SISTERS._,"And all his flaws are seen, all floating in his mind. }"
14801,_THE SISTERS._,A little boldness in his speech. What then?
14802,_THE SISTERS._,It is the failing of these generous men.
14803,_THE SISTERS._,"A little vanity, but--O! my dear,"
14804,_THE SISTERS._,"They all would show it, were they all sincere.           250"
14805,_THE SISTERS._,"“‘But come, agreed; we’ll lend each other eyes"
14806,_THE SISTERS._,"To see our favourites, when they wear disguise;"
14807,_THE SISTERS._,And all those errors that will then be shown
14808,_THE SISTERS._,Uninfluenced by the workings of our own.’
14809,_THE SISTERS._,"“Thus lived the sisters, far from power removed,"
14810,_THE SISTERS._,"And far from need, both loving and beloved."
14811,_THE SISTERS._,"Thus grew, as myrtles grow; I grieve at heart"
14812,_THE SISTERS._,That I have pain and sorrow to impart.
14813,_THE SISTERS._,"But so it is, the sweetest herbs that grow"
14814,_THE SISTERS._,"In the lone vale, where sweetest waters flow,            260"
14815,_THE SISTERS._,"Ere drops the blossom, or appears the fruit,"
14816,_THE SISTERS._,"Feel the vile grub, and perish at the root;"
14817,_THE SISTERS._,"And, in a quick and premature decay,"
14818,_THE SISTERS._,Breathe the pure fragrance of their life away.
14819,_THE SISTERS._,"“A town was near, in which the buildings all"

14838,_THE SISTERS._,"Cause a canal where treasures were to swim,"
14839,_THE SISTERS._,And they should owe their opulence to him!
14840,_THE SISTERS._,"In fact, of riches he insured a crop,"
14841,_THE SISTERS._,So they would give him but a seed to drop.
14842,_THE SISTERS._,"As used the alchymist his boasts to make,"
14843,_THE SISTERS._,‘I give you millions for the mite I take:’
14844,_THE SISTERS._,"The mite they never could again behold,"
14845,_THE SISTERS._,The millions all were Eldorado gold.                     290

14861,_THE SISTERS._,"At once so great, so humble, and so free;"
14862,_THE SISTERS._,"Whom others sought, nor always with success!"
14863,_THE SISTERS._,But they were both her pride and happiness;

14929,_THE SISTERS._,"And Lucy’s prudence, though it was alarm’d,"
14930,_THE SISTERS._,Was by the splendor of the Banker charm’d;
14931,_THE SISTERS._,"What was her paltry thousand pounds to him,"
14932,_THE SISTERS._,Who would expend five thousand on a whim?
14933,_THE SISTERS._,And then the portion of his wife was known;

14956,_THE SISTERS._,"Humble, or forward, in his freedom seen;"
14957,_THE SISTERS._,His was the frankness of a mind that shows
14958,_THE SISTERS._,"It knows itself, nor fears for what it knows."
14959,_THE SISTERS._,But Lucy’s ever humble friend was awed
14960,_THE SISTERS._,By the profusion he could not applaud;
14961,_THE SISTERS._,He seem’d indeed reluctant to partake
14962,_THE SISTERS._,Of the collation that he could not make;

15129,_THE SISTERS._,That a dull school-boy fixes on his book
15130,_THE SISTERS._,"That he resigns, with mingled shame and joy,"
15131,_THE SISTERS._,"So Barlow went, confounded like the boy."
15132,_THE SISTERS._,"“Jane, while she wept to think her sister’s pain"
15133,_THE SISTERS._,"Was thus increased, felt infinite disdain;"
15134,_THE SISTERS._,"Bound as she was, and wedded by the ties"
15135,_THE SISTERS._,"Of love and hope, that care and craft despise,           580"
15136,_THE SISTERS._,"She could but wonder that a man, whose taste"
15137,_THE SISTERS._,"And zeal for money had a Jew disgraced,"
15138,_THE SISTERS._,"Should love her sister; yet with this surprise,"
15139,_THE SISTERS._,She felt a little exultation rise;
15140,_THE SISTERS._,Hers was a lover who had always held
15141,_THE SISTERS._,"This man as base, by generous scorn impell’d,"
15142,_THE SISTERS._,"And yet, as one, of whom for Lucy’s sake"
15143,_THE SISTERS._,He would a civil distant notice take.
15144,_THE SISTERS._,"“Lucy, with sadden’d heart and temper mild,"
15145,_THE SISTERS._,"Bow’d to correction, like an humbled child,              590"
15146,_THE SISTERS._,"Who feels the parent’s kindness, and who knows"
15147,_THE SISTERS._,Such the correction he who loves bestows.
15148,_THE SISTERS._,"“Attending always, but attending more"
15149,_THE SISTERS._,"When sorrow ask’d his presence than before,"
15150,_THE SISTERS._,"Tender and ardent, with the kindest air"
15151,_THE SISTERS._,"Came Bloomer, fortune’s error to repair;"
15152,_THE SISTERS._,"Words sweetly soothing spoke the happy youth,"
15153,_THE SISTERS._,With all the tender earnestness of truth.
15154,_THE SISTERS._,“There was no doubt of his intention now--
15155,_THE SISTERS._,He will his purpose with his love avow;                  600
15156,_THE SISTERS._,"So judged the maid; yet, waiting, she admired"
15157,_THE SISTERS._,His still delaying what he most desired;
15158,_THE SISTERS._,"Till, from her spirit’s agitation free,"
15159,_THE SISTERS._,She might determine when the day should be.
15160,_THE SISTERS._,With such facility the partial mind
15161,_THE SISTERS._,Can the best motives for its favourites find.
15162,_THE SISTERS._,"“Of this he spake not, but he stayed beyond"
15163,_THE SISTERS._,His usual hour--attentive still and fond;--
15164,_THE SISTERS._,"The hand yet firmer to the hand he prest,"
15165,_THE SISTERS._,And the eye rested where it loved to rest;               610
15166,_THE SISTERS._,"Then took he certain freedoms, yet so small"
15167,_THE SISTERS._,That it was prudish so the things to call;
15168,_THE SISTERS._,"Things they were not--‘Describe’--that none can do,"
15169,_THE SISTERS._,They had been nothing had they not been new;
15170,_THE SISTERS._,"It was the manner and the look; a maid,"
15171,_THE SISTERS._,"Afraid of such, is foolishly afraid;"
15172,_THE SISTERS._,For what could she explain? The piercing eye
15173,_THE SISTERS._,Of jealous fear could nought amiss descry.
15174,_THE SISTERS._,“But some concern now rose; the youth would seek
15175,_THE SISTERS._,"Jane by herself, and then would nothing speak,           610"
15176,_THE SISTERS._,"Before not spoken; there was still delay,"
15177,_THE SISTERS._,"Vexatious, wearying, wasting, day by day."
15178,_THE SISTERS._,“‘He does not surely trifle!’ Heaven forbid!
15179,_THE SISTERS._,She now should doubly scorn him if he did.
15180,_THE SISTERS._,"“Ah! more than this, unlucky girl! is thine;"
15181,_THE SISTERS._,Thou must the fondest views of life resign;
15182,_THE SISTERS._,"And in the very time resign them too,"
15183,_THE SISTERS._,When they were brightening on the eager view.
15184,_THE SISTERS._,"I will be brief,--nor have I heart to dwell"
15185,_THE SISTERS._,On crimes they almost share who paint them well.         630
15186,_THE SISTERS._,"“There was a moment’s softness, and it seem’d"
15187,_THE SISTERS._,"Discretion slept, or so the lover dream’d;"
15188,_THE SISTERS._,"And, watching long the now confiding maid,"
15189,_THE SISTERS._,"He thought her guardless, and grew less afraid;"
15190,_THE SISTERS._,"Led to the theme that he had shunn’d before,"
15191,_THE SISTERS._,He used a language he must use no more--
15192,_THE SISTERS._,"For if it answers, there is no more need,"
15193,_THE SISTERS._,"And no more trial, should it not succeed."
15194,_THE SISTERS._,"“Then made he that attempt, in which to fail"
15195,_THE SISTERS._,"Is shameful,--still more shameful to prevail.            640"
15196,_THE SISTERS._,“Then was there lightning in that eye that shed
15197,_THE SISTERS._,Its beams upon him--and his frenzy fled;
15198,_THE SISTERS._,"Abject and trembling at her feet he laid,"
15199,_THE SISTERS._,"Despised and scorn’d by the indignant maid,"
15200,_THE SISTERS._,"Whose spirits in their agitation rose,"
15201,_THE SISTERS._,"Him, and her own weak pity, to oppose:"
15202,_THE SISTERS._,"As liquid silver in the tube mounts high,"
15203,_THE SISTERS._,Then shakes and settles as the storm goes by.
15204,_THE SISTERS._,"“While yet the lover stay’d, the maid was strong,"
15205,_THE SISTERS._,"But when he fled, she droop’d and felt the wrong--      650"
15206,_THE SISTERS._,"Felt the alarming chill, the enfeebled breath,"
15207,_THE SISTERS._,"Closed the quick eye, and sank in transient death."
15208,_THE SISTERS._,So Lucy found her; and then first that breast
15209,_THE SISTERS._,"Knew anger’s power, and own’d the stranger guest."
15210,_THE SISTERS._,“‘And is this love? Ungenerous! Has he too
15211,_THE SISTERS._,Been mean and abject? Is no being true?’
15212,_THE SISTERS._,"For Lucy judged that, like her prudent swain,"
15213,_THE SISTERS._,Bloomer had talk’d of what a man might gain;
15214,_THE SISTERS._,"She did not think a man on earth was found,"
15215,_THE SISTERS._,"A wounded bosom, while it bleeds, to wound;              660"
15216,_THE SISTERS._,"Thought not that mortal could be so unjust,"
15217,_THE SISTERS._,As to deprive affliction of its trust;
15218,_THE SISTERS._,"Thought not a lover could the hope enjoy,"
15219,_THE SISTERS._,That must the peace he should promote destroy;
15220,_THE SISTERS._,"Thought not, in fact, that in the world were those,"
15221,_THE SISTERS._,"Who to their tenderest friends are worse than foes,"
15222,_THE SISTERS._,"Who win the heart, deprive it of its care,"
15223,_THE SISTERS._,Then plant remorse and desolation there.
15224,_THE SISTERS._,"“Ah! cruel he, who can that heart deprive"
15225,_THE SISTERS._,Of all that keeps its energy alive;                      670
15226,_THE SISTERS._,"Can see consign’d to shame the trusting fair,"
15227,_THE SISTERS._,And turn confiding fondness to despair;
15228,_THE SISTERS._,To watch that time--a name is not assign’d
15229,_THE SISTERS._,"For crime so odious, nor shall learning find."
15230,_THE SISTERS._,"Now, from that day has Lucy laid aside"
15231,_THE SISTERS._,"Her proper cares, to be her sister’s guide,"
15232,_THE SISTERS._,"Guard, and protector. At their uncle’s farm"
15233,_THE SISTERS._,"They past the period of their first alarm,"
15234,_THE SISTERS._,"But soon retired, nor was he grieved to learn"
15235,_THE SISTERS._,They made their own affairs their own concern.           680
15236,_THE SISTERS._,"“I knew not then their worth; and, had I known,"
15237,_THE SISTERS._,Could not the kindness of a friend have shown;
15238,_THE SISTERS._,"For men they dreaded; they a dwelling sought,"
15239,_THE SISTERS._,And there the children of the village taught;
15240,_THE SISTERS._,"There, firm and patient, Lucy still depends"
15241,_THE SISTERS._,"Upon her efforts, not upon her friends;"
15242,_THE SISTERS._,"She is with persevering strength endued,"
15243,_THE SISTERS._,And can be cheerful--for she will be good.
15244,_THE SISTERS._,"“Jane too will strive the daily tasks to share,"
15245,_THE SISTERS._,That so employment may contend with care;                690
15246,_THE SISTERS._,"Not power, but will, she shows, and looks about       }"
15247,_THE SISTERS._,"On her small people, who come in and out;             }"
15248,_THE SISTERS._,"And seems of what they need, or she can do, in doubt. }"
15249,_THE SISTERS._,"“There sits the chubby crew on seats around,"
15250,_THE SISTERS._,"While she, all rueful at the sight and sound,"
15251,_THE SISTERS._,"Shrinks from the free approaches of the tribe,"
15252,_THE SISTERS._,"Whom she attempts, lamenting to describe;"
15253,_THE SISTERS._,"With stains the idlers gather’d in their way,         }"
15254,_THE SISTERS._,"The simple stains of mud, and mould, and clay,        }"
15255,_THE SISTERS._,"And compound of the streets, of what we dare not say; }"
15256,_THE SISTERS._,"With hair uncomb’d, grimed face, and piteous look,       701"
15257,_THE SISTERS._,"Each heavy student takes the odious book,"
15258,_THE SISTERS._,"And on the lady casts a glance of fear,"
15259,_THE SISTERS._,Who draws the garment close as he comes near;
15260,_THE SISTERS._,"She then for Lucy’s mild forbearance tries,"
15261,_THE SISTERS._,"And from her pupils turns her brilliant eyes,"
15262,_THE SISTERS._,"Making new efforts, and with some success,"
15263,_THE SISTERS._,To pay attention while the students guess;
15264,_THE SISTERS._,"Who to the gentler mistress fain would glide,"
15265,_THE SISTERS._,And dread their station at the lady’s side.              710
15266,_THE SISTERS._,“Such is their fate;--there is a friendly few
15267,_THE SISTERS._,"Whom they receive, and there is chance for you;"
15268,_THE SISTERS._,"Their school, and something gather’d from the wreck"
15269,_THE SISTERS._,"Of that bad Bank, keeps poverty in check;"
15270,_THE SISTERS._,"And true respect, and high regard, are theirs,"
15271,_THE SISTERS._,"The children’s profit, and the [parents’] prayers."
15272,_THE SISTERS._,"“With Lucy rests the one peculiar care,                  }"
15273,_THE SISTERS._,"That few must see, and none with her may share;            }"
15274,_THE SISTERS._,"More dear than hope can be, more sweet than pleasures are. }"
15275,_THE SISTERS._,For her sad sister needs the care of love                720
15276,_THE SISTERS._,"That will direct her, that will not reprove,"
15277,_THE SISTERS._,"But waits to warn: for Jane will walk alone,"
15278,_THE SISTERS._,Will sing in low and melancholy tone;
15279,_THE SISTERS._,"Will read or write, or to her plants will run,"
15280,_THE SISTERS._,"To shun her friends,--alas! her thoughts to shun."
15281,_THE SISTERS._,"“It is not love alone disturbs her rest,"
15282,_THE SISTERS._,But loss of all that ever hope possess’d:
15283,_THE SISTERS._,"Friends ever kind, life’s lively pleasures, ease,       }"
15284,_THE SISTERS._,When her enjoyments could no longer please;             }
15285,_THE SISTERS._,These were her comforts then! she has no more of these. }
15286,_THE SISTERS._,"“Wrapt in such thoughts, she feels her mind astray,    731"
15287,_THE SISTERS._,But knows ’tis true that she has lost her way;
15288,_THE SISTERS._,"For Lucy’s smile will check the sudden flight,"
15289,_THE SISTERS._,And one kind look let in the wonted light.
15290,_THE SISTERS._,"“Fits of long silence she endures, then talks"
15291,_THE SISTERS._,"Too much--with too much ardour, as she walks;"
15292,_THE SISTERS._,But still the shrubs that she admires dispense
15293,_THE SISTERS._,"Their balmy freshness to the hurried sense,"
15294,_THE SISTERS._,"And she will watch their progress, and attend"
15295,_THE SISTERS._,Her flowering favourites as a guardian friend;           740
15296,_THE SISTERS._,"To sun or shade she will her sweets remove,"
15297,_THE SISTERS._,"‘And here,’ she says, ‘I may with safety love.’"
15298,_THE SISTERS._,“But there are hours when on that bosom steals
15299,_THE SISTERS._,A rising terror--then indeed she feels--
15300,_THE SISTERS._,"Feels how she loved the promised good, and how"
15301,_THE SISTERS._,She feels the failure of the promise now.
15302,_THE SISTERS._,"“‘That other spoiler did as robbers do,"
15303,_THE SISTERS._,"Made poor our state, but not disgraceful too,"
15304,_THE SISTERS._,"This spoiler shames me, and I look within"
15305,_THE SISTERS._,To find some cause that drew him on to sin;              750
15306,_THE SISTERS._,He and the wretch who could thy worth forsake
15307,_THE SISTERS._,Are the fork’d adder and the loathsome snake;
15308,_THE SISTERS._,"Thy snake could slip in villain-fear away,"
15309,_THE SISTERS._,But had no fang to fasten on his prey.
15310,_THE SISTERS._,"“‘Oh! my dear Lucy, I had thought to live"
15311,_THE SISTERS._,With all the comforts easy fortunes give;
15312,_THE SISTERS._,"A wife caressing, and caress’d--a friend,"
15313,_THE SISTERS._,"Whom he would guide, advise, consult, defend,"
15314,_THE SISTERS._,And make his equal;--then I fondly thought
15315,_THE SISTERS._,Among superior creatures to be brought;                  760
15316,_THE SISTERS._,"And, while with them, delighted to behold"
15317,_THE SISTERS._,"No eye averted, and no bosom cold;--"
15318,_THE SISTERS._,"Then at my home, a mother, to embrace            }"
15319,_THE SISTERS._,"My----Oh! my sister, it was surely base!         }"
15320,_THE SISTERS._,I might forget the wrong; I cannot the disgrace. }
15321,_THE SISTERS._,"“‘Oh! when I saw that triumph in his eyes,"
15322,_THE SISTERS._,I felt my spirits with his own arise;
15323,_THE SISTERS._,"I call’d it joy, and said, the generous youth"
15324,_THE SISTERS._,"Laughs at my loss--no trial for his truth,"
15325,_THE SISTERS._,"It is a trifle he can not lament,                        770"
15326,_THE SISTERS._,A sum but equal to his annual rent;
15327,_THE SISTERS._,"And yet that loss, the cause of every ill,"
15328,_THE SISTERS._,"Has made me poor, and him--’"
15329,_THE SISTERS._,“‘O! poorer still;
15330,_THE SISTERS._,"Poorer, my Jane, and far below thee now:"
15331,_THE SISTERS._,"The injurer he,--the injured sufferer thou;"

15336,_THE SISTERS._,Of an aspiring spirit?--O! I lose                      }
15337,_THE SISTERS._,"Whate’er the happy feel, whatever the sanguine choose. }"
15338,_THE SISTERS._,"“‘Would I could lose this bitter sense of wrong,       781"
15339,_THE SISTERS._,And sleep in peace--but it will not be long!
15340,_THE SISTERS._,"And here is something, Lucy, in my brain--"
15341,_THE SISTERS._,I know not what--it is a cure for pain;
15342,_THE SISTERS._,"But is not death!--no beckoning hand I see,"
15343,_THE SISTERS._,No voice I hear that comes alone to me;
15344,_THE SISTERS._,"It is not death, but change; I am not now"
15345,_THE SISTERS._,As I was once--nor can I tell you how;
15346,_THE SISTERS._,"Nor is it madness--ask, and you shall find"
15347,_THE SISTERS._,In my replies the soundness of my mind:                  790
15348,_THE SISTERS._,O! I should be a trouble all day long;
15349,_THE SISTERS._,"A very torment, if my head were wrong.’"
15350,_THE SISTERS._,“At times there is upon her features seen
15351,_THE SISTERS._,What moves suspicion--she is too serene.
15352,_THE SISTERS._,"Such is the motion of a drunken man,"
15353,_THE SISTERS._,"Who steps sedately, just to show he can."
15354,_THE SISTERS._,"Absent at times she will her mother call,"
15355,_THE SISTERS._,"And cry at mid-day, ‘then good night to all.’"
15356,_THE SISTERS._,But most she thinks there will some good ensue
15357,_THE SISTERS._,"From something done, or what she is to do;               800"
15358,_THE SISTERS._,"Long wrapt in silence, she will then assume"
15359,_THE SISTERS._,"An air of business, and shake off her gloom;"
15360,_THE SISTERS._,"Then cry exulting, ‘O! it must succeed,"
15361,_THE SISTERS._,There are ten thousand readers--all men read:

15368,_THE SISTERS._,"Come, let us count what numbers we believe"
15369,_THE SISTERS._,"Will buy our work--Ah! sister, do you grieve?"
15370,_THE SISTERS._,"You weep; there’s something I have said amiss,"
15371,_THE SISTERS._,And vex’d my sister--What a world is this!
15372,_THE SISTERS._,And how I wander!--Where has fancy run?
15373,_THE SISTERS._,Is there no poem? Have I nothing done?
15374,_THE SISTERS._,"Forgive me, Lucy, I had fix’d my eye,"
15375,_THE SISTERS._,"And so my mind, on works that cannot die,"
15376,_THE SISTERS._,_Marmion_ and _Lara_ yonder in the case;

15488,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Whom pass’d we musing near the woodman’s shed,"
15489,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Whose horse not only carried him but led,"
15490,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"That his grave rider might have slept the time,"
15491,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Or solved a problem, or composed a rhyme?"
15492,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,A more abstracted man within my view
15493,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Has never come--He recollected you.”
15494,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Yes--he was thoughtful--thinks the whole day long,"
15495,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Deeply, and chiefly that he once thought wrong;"
15496,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,He thought a strong and kindred mind to trace
15497,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,In the soft outlines of a trifler’s face.                 10
15498,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“Poor Finch! I knew him when at school--a boy
15499,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Who might be said his labours to enjoy;
15500,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,So young a pedant that he always took
15501,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The girl to dance who most admired her book;
15502,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And would the butler and the cook surprise,"
15503,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Who listen’d to his Latin exercise;
15504,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The matron’s self the praise of Finch avow’d,"
15505,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"He was so serious, and he read so loud."
15506,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"But yet, with all this folly and conceit,"
15507,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The lines he wrote were elegant and neat;                20
15508,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And early promise in his mind appear’d
15509,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Of noble efforts when by reason clear’d.
15510,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“And when he spoke of wives, the boy would say,"
15511,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,His should be skill’d in Greek and algebra;
15512,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"For who would talk with one to whom his themes,"
15513,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And favourite studies, were no more than dreams?"
15514,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"For this, though courteous, gentle, and humane,"
15515,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The boys contemn’d and hated him as vain,"
15516,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Stiff and pedantic.--”
15517,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Did the man enjoy,"
15518,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"In after life, the visions of the boy?”--                30"
15519,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“At least they form’d his wishes, they were yet"
15520,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The favourite views on which his mind was set:
15521,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"He quaintly said, how happy must they prove,"
15522,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Who, loving, study--or who, studious, love;"
15523,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Who feel their minds with sciences imbued,"
15524,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And their warm hearts by beauty’s force subdued.
15525,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“His widow’d mother, who the world had seen,"
15526,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And better judge of either sex had been,"
15527,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Told him that, just as their affairs were placed,"
15528,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,In some respects he must forego his taste;                40
15529,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"That every beauty, both of form and mind,"
15530,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Must be by him, if unendow’d, resign’d;"
15531,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That wealth was wanted for their joint affairs;
15532,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"His sisters’ portions, and the Hall’s repairs."
15533,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“The son assented--and the wife must bring
15534,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Wealth, learning, beauty, ere he gave the ring;"
15535,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"But as these merits, when they all unite,"
15536,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Are not produced in every soil and site;
15537,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And when produced are not the certain gain
15538,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Of him who would these precious things obtain;            50
15539,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Our patient student waited many a year,"
15540,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Nor saw this phœnix in his walks appear.
15541,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"But, as views mended in the joint estate,"
15542,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,He would a something in his points abate;
15543,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Give him but learning, beauty, temper, sense,"
15544,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And he would then the happy state commence.
15545,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The mother sigh’d, but she at last agreed;"
15546,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And now the son was likely to succeed.
15547,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Wealth is substantial good the fates allot:
15548,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"We know we have it, or we have it not;                    60"
15549,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But all those graces which men highly rate
15550,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Their minds themselves imagine and create;
15551,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And therefore Finch was in a way to find
15552,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,A good that much depended on his mind.
15553,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“He look’d around, observing, till he saw"
15554,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Augusta Dallas! when he felt an awe
15555,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Of so much beauty and commanding grace,"
15556,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That well became the honours of her race.
15557,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“This lady never boasted of the trash
15558,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That commerce brings: she never spoke of cash;            70
15559,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The gentle blood that ran in every vein
15560,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,At all such notions blush’d in pure disdain.--
15561,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Wealth once relinquished, there was all beside,"
15562,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"As Finch believed, that could adorn a bride;"
15563,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"He could not gaze upon the form and air,"
15564,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Without concluding all was right and fair;
15565,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Her mild but dignified reserve supprest                }
15566,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"All free inquiry--but his mind could rest,             }"
15567,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Assured that all was well, and in that view was blest. }"
15568,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“And now he asked, ’am I the happy man                  80"
15569,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Who can deserve her? is there one who can?’
15570,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"His mother told him, he possess’d the land"
15571,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That puts a man in heart to ask a hand;
15572,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,All who possess it feel they bear about
15573,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,A spell that puts a speedy end to doubt;
15574,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But Finch was modest--‘May it then be thought            }
15575,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That she can so be gained?’--‘She may be sought.--’      }
15576,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,‘Can love with land be won?’--‘By land is beauty bought. }
15577,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Do not, dear Charles, with indignation glow,"
15578,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,All value that the want of which they know;               90
15579,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Nor do I blame her; none that worth denies;
15580,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But can my son be sure of what he buys?
15581,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Beauty she has, but with it can you find"
15582,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The inquiring spirit, or the studious mind?"
15583,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"This wilt thou need who art to thinking prone,"
15584,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And minds unpair’d had better think alone;
15585,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Then how unhappy will the husband be,"
15586,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Whose sole associate spoils his company?‘
15587,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,This he would try; but all such trials prove
15588,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Too mighty for a man disposed to love;                   100
15589,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,He whom the magic of a face enchains
15590,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But little knowledge of the mind obtains;
15591,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"If by his tender heart the man is led,"
15592,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,He finds how erring is the soundest head.
15593,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“The lady saw his purpose; she could meet
15594,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The man‘s inquiry, and his aim defeat;"
15595,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,She had a studied flattery in her look;
15596,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,She could be seen retiring with a book;
15597,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,She by attending to his speech could prove
15598,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That she for learning had a fervent love--              110
15599,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Yet love alone, she modestly declared;"
15600,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"She must be spared inquiry, and was spared;"
15601,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Of her poor studies she was not so weak
15602,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"As in his presence, or at all, to speak;"
15603,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"But to discourse with him who, all agreed,"
15604,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"[Had] read so much, would be absurd indeed;"
15605,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Ask what he might, she was so much a dunce"
15606,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,She would confess her ignorance at once.
15607,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“All this the man believed not--doom‘d to grieve
15608,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"For this belief, he this would not believe:              120"
15609,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,No! he was quite in raptures to discern
15610,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"That love, and that avidity to learn."
15611,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"’Could she have found,‘ she said, ’a friend, a guide,"
15612,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Like him, to study had been all her pride;"
15613,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"But, doom‘d so long to frivolous employ,"
15614,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,How could she those superior views enjoy?
15615,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The day might come--a happy day for her,"
15616,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,When she might choose the ways she should prefer.‘
15617,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Then too he learn‘d in accidental way,        }"

15619,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"In dissipation wild, in visitation gay.          }"
15620,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Happy, most happy, must the woman prove"
15621,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Who proudly looks on him she vows to love;
15622,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Who can her humble acquisitions state,"
15623,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"That he will praise, at least will tolerate."
15624,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Still the cool mother sundry doubts express‘d,--"
15625,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,’How! is Augusta graver than the rest?
15626,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,There are three others: they are not inclined
15627,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,To feed with precious food the empty mind;
15628,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Whence this strong relish?‘ ’It is very strong,‘         140"
15629,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Replied the son, ’and has possess‘d her long;"
15630,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Increased indeed, I may presume, by views--"
15631,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,We may suppose--ah! may she not refuse?‘
15632,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"’Fear not!--I see the question must be tried,"
15633,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Nay, is determined--let us to your bride.‘"
15634,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“They soon were wedded, and the nymph appear‘d"
15635,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,By all her promised excellence endear‘d:
15636,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Her words were kind, were cautious, and were few,"
15637,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And she was proud--of what her husband knew.
15638,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Weeks pass‘d away, some five or six, before,          150"
15639,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Bless‘d in the present, Finch could think of more."
15640,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"A month was next upon a journey spent,"
15641,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,When to the Lakes the fond companions went;
15642,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Then the gay town received them, and, at last,"
15643,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Home to their mansion, man and wife, they pass‘d."
15644,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“And now in quiet way they came to live
15645,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"On what their fortune, love, and hopes would give."
15646,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The honied moon had nought but silver rays,"
15647,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And shone benignly on their early days;
15648,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The second moon a light less vivid shed,                 160"
15649,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And now the silver rays were tinged with lead.
15650,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"They now began to look beyond the Hall,"
15651,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And think what friends would make a morning-call;
15652,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Their former appetites return‘d, and now"
15653,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Both could their wishes and their tastes avow;
15654,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘Twas now no longer ’just what you approve,‘"
15655,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"But ’let the wild fowl be to-day, my love.‘"
15656,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"In fact the senses, drawn aside by force"
15657,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Of a strong passion, sought their usual course."
15658,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Now to her music would the wife repair,               170"
15659,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,To which he listen‘d once with eager air;
15660,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"When there was so much harmony within,"
15661,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That any note was sure its way to win;
15662,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But now the sweet melodious tones were sent
15663,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"From the struck chords, and none cared where they went."
15664,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Full well we know that many a favourite air
15665,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That charms a party fails to charm a pair;
15666,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And as Augusta play‘d she look‘d around,"
15667,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,To see if one was dying at the sound;
15668,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"But all were gone--a husband, wrapt in gloom,            180"
15669,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Stalk‘d careless, listless, up and down the room."
15670,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“And now ‘tis time to fill that ductile mind
15671,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"With knowledge, from his stores of various kind."
15672,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"His mother, in a peevish mood, had ask‘d,"
15673,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,’Does your Augusta profit? is she task’d?’
15674,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘Madam!’ he cried, offended with her looks,"
15675,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘There’s time for all things, and not all for books:"
15676,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Just on one’s marriage to sit down, and prate"
15677,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"On points of learning, is a thing I hate.--’"
15678,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘’Tis right, my son, and it appears to me,            190"
15679,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"If deep your hatred, you must well agree.’"
15680,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“Finch was too angry for a man so wise,"
15681,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And said, ‘Insinuation I despise!"
15682,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Nor do I wish to have a mind so full
15683,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Of learned trash--it makes a woman dull:
15684,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Let it suffice, that I in her discern"
15685,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"An aptitude, and a desire to learn.--’"
15686,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“The matron smiled, but she observed a frown"
15687,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"On her son’s brow, and calmly sat her down,"
15688,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Leaving the truth to Time, who solves our doubt,         200"
15689,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,By bringing his all-glorious daughter out--
15690,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Truth! for whose beauty all their love profess;
15691,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And yet how many think it ugliness!
15692,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘Augusta, love,’ said Finch, ‘while you engage"
15693,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"In that embroidery, let me read a page."
15694,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Suppose it Hume’s; indeed he takes a side,"
15695,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But still an author need not be our guide;
15696,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And, as he writes with elegance and ease,"
15697,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Do now attend--he will be sure to please.
15698,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Here at the Revolution we commence--                    210
15699,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"We date, you know, our liberties from hence.’"
15700,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘Yes, sure,’ Augusta answer’d with a smile;"
15701,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘Our teacher always talk’d about his style,"
15702,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"When we about the Revolution read,"
15703,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And how the martyrs to the flames were led:
15704,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The good old bishops, I forget their names,"
15705,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But they were all committed to the flames;
15706,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Maidens and widows, bachelors and wives--"
15707,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The very babes and sucklings lost their lives.
15708,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,I read it all in Guthrie at the school--                220
15709,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,What now!--I know you took me for a fool;
15710,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"There were five bishops taken from the stall,"
15711,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And twenty widows, I remember all;"
15712,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And by this token, that our teacher tried"
15713,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"’To cry for pity, till she howl’d and cried.’"
15714,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘True, true, my love, but you mistake the thing--"
15715,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The Revolution that made William king
15716,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Is what I mean; the Reformation you,"
15717,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,In Edward and Elizabeth.’--‘’Tis true;
15718,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But the nice reading is the love between                 230
15719,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The brave Lord Essex and the cruel queen;
15720,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And how he sent the ring to save his head,"

15722,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘That is all true; now read, and I’ll attend;"
15723,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But was not she a most deceitful friend?

15727,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And ‘God forgive you!’ was the word she said;

15733,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Said he, recovering; ‘now I cannot read.’"
15734,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“They walk’d at leisure through their wood and groves,"
15735,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"In fields and lanes, and talk’d of plants and loves,"
15736,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And loves of plants.--Said Finch, ‘Augusta, dear,"
15737,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"You said you loved to learn,--were you sincere?"
15738,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Do you remember that you told me once                    250
15739,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"How much you grieved, and said you were a dunce?"
15740,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"That is, you wanted information. Say,"

15742,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘Goodness!’ said she, ‘what meanings you discern"

15744,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And so I think I did; and you replied,"
15745,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The wish was good: what would you now beside?
15746,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Did not you say it show’d an ardent mind;

15748,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘My dear Augusta, could you wish indeed               260"
15749,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"For any knowledge, and not then proceed?"
15750,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,That is not wishing----’
15751,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“‘Mercy! how you tease!

15764,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Your thought was happy--let us persevere;
15765,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And let no trifling cause our work retard.’
15766,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Agreed the lady, but she fear’d it hard."
15767,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“Now o’er the grounds they rambled many a mile;

15771,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Of these he treated, every varying shape,"
15772,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Till poor Augusta panted to escape.
15773,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"He show’d the various foliage plants produce,"
15774,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Lunate and lyrate, runcinate, retuse;"
15775,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Long were the learned words, and urged with force,"

15777,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Latent, and patent, papulous, and plane--"
15778,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘Oh!’ said the pupil, ‘it will turn my brain.’"

15780,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"To fill that mind, o’er class and order went;"
15781,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And stopping, ‘Now,’ said he, ‘my love, attend.’"
15782,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘I do,’ said she, ‘but when will be an end?’--"
15783,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘When we have made some progress--now begin,"

15793,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"The system brought to aid them in their view,"
15794,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,And now with sighs return’d--‘It will not do.’
15795,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“A handsome face first led him to suppose,"
15796,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,There must be talent with such looks as those;
15797,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The want of talent taught him now to find
15798,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The face less handsome with so poor a mind;
15799,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And half the beauty faded, when he found                 310"
15800,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,His cherish’d hopes were falling to the ground.
15801,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“Finch lost his spirit; but e’en then he sought
15802,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,For fancied powers: she might in time be taught.
15803,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Sure there was nothing in that mind to fear;
15804,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The favourite study did not yet appear.--
15805,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“Once he express’d a doubt if she could look
15806,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,For five succeeding minutes on a book;
15807,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"When, with awaken’d spirit, she replied,"
15808,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘He was mistaken, and she would be tried.’"
15809,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“With this delighted, he new hopes express’d--        320"
15810,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,‘How do I know?--She may abide the test?
15811,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Men I have known, and famous in their day,"
15812,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Who were by chance directed in their way.
15813,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"I have been hasty.--Well, Augusta, well,"
15814,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,What is your favourite reading? prithee tell;
15815,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Our different tastes may different books require--
15816,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Yours I may not peruse, and yet admire:"
15817,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Do then explain.’--‘Good Heaven!’ said she, in haste,"
15818,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,‘How do I hate these lectures upon taste!’
15819,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘I lecture not, my love; but do declare--            330"
15820,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"You read, you say--what your attainments are.’"
15821,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘Oh! you believe,’ said she, ‘that other things"
15822,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Are read as well as histories of kings,"
15823,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And loves of plants, with all that simple stuff"
15824,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"About their sex, of which I know enough."
15825,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Well, if I must, I will my studies name,"
15826,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Blame if you please--I know you love to blame.
15827,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"When all our childish books were set apart,"
15828,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,The first I read was ‘Wanderings of the Heart:’
15829,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"It was a story, where was done a deed                    340"
15830,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"So dreadful, that alone I fear’d to read."
15831,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,“‘The next was ‘The Confessions of a Nun--’
15832,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,’Twas quite a shame such evil should be done;
15833,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"‘Nun of--no matter for the creature’s name,"
15834,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,For there are girls no nunnery can tame.
15835,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Then was the story of the Haunted Hall,"
15836,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Where the huge picture nodded from the wall
15837,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"When the old lord look’d up with trembling dread,"
15838,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"And I grew pale, and shudder’d as I read."
15839,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Then came the tales of Winters, Summers, Springs,        350"
15840,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"At Bath and Brighton,--they were pretty things!"
15841,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"No ghosts nor spectres there were heard or seen,"
15842,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,But all was love and flight to Gretna-green.
15843,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Perhaps your greater learning may despise
15844,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"What others like, and there your wisdom lies--"
15845,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Well! do not frown--I read the tender tales
15846,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"Of lonely cots, retreats in silent vales"
15847,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"For maids forsaken, and suspected wives,"
15848,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,Against whose peace some foe his plot contrives;

15851,THE PRECEPTOR HUSBAND.,"“‘I read all plays that on the boards succeed, }"

16010,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And till th’ offending parties chose to stoop,"
16011,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,She judged it right to keep resentment up;
16012,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Could she in friendship with a woman live
16013,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Who could the insult of a man forgive?
16014,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Did not her husband in a crowded room                    120
16015,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Once call her idiot, and the thing was dumb?"
16016,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The man’s attack was brutal to be sure,"
16017,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But she no less an idiot to endure.
16018,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“This lofty dame, with unrelenting soul,"
16019,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Had a fair girl to govern and control;
16020,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The dear Maria!--whom, when first I met,--"
16021,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Shame on this weakness! do I feel it yet?
16022,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“The parents’ anger, you will oft-times see,"
16023,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Prepares the children’s minds for amity;
16024,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Youth will not enter into such debate,                   130"
16025,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,’Tis not in them to cherish groundless hate;
16026,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Nor can they feel men’s quarrels or their cares,"
16027,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of whig or tory, partridges or hares."
16028,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Long ere we loved, this gentle girl and I"
16029,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Gave to our parents’ discord many a sigh;
16030,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"It was not ours--and, when the meeting came,"
16031,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It pleased us much to find our thoughts the same;
16032,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But grief and trouble in our minds arose
16033,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,From the fierce spirits we could not compose;
16034,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And much it vex’d us that the friends so dear            140
16035,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,To us should foes among themselves appear.
16036,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Such was this maid, the angel of her race,"
16037,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Whom I had loved in any time and place,"
16038,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But in a time and place which chance assign’d,"
16039,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,When it was almost treason to be kind;
16040,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When we had vast impediments in view,"
16041,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Then wonder not that love in terror grew
16042,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"With double speed--we look’d, and strove to find"
16043,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,A kindred spirit in the hostile mind;
16044,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But is it hostile? there appears no sign                 150
16045,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,In those dear looks of warfare--none have mine;
16046,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,At length I whisper’d--‘Would that war might cease
16047,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Between our houses, and that all was peace!’"
16048,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A sweet confusion on her features rose,"
16049,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘She could not bear to think of having foes,"
16050,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When we might all as friends and neighbours live,"
16051,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And for that blessing, O! what would she give!’--"
16052,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘Then let us try and our endeavours blend,’"
16053,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I said, ‘to bring these quarrels to an end.’"
16054,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Thus, with one purpose in our hearts, we strove,         160"
16055,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And, if no more, increased our secret love:"
16056,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Love that, with such impediments in view,"
16057,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,To meet the growing danger stronger grew;
16058,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And from that time each heart, resolved and sure,"
16059,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Grew firm in hope, and patient to endure."
16060,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“To those who know this season of delight
16061,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I need not strive their feelings to excite;
16062,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To those who know not the delight or pain,"
16063,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The best description would be lent in vain;
16064,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And to the grieving, who will no more find               170"
16065,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The bower of bliss, to paint it were unkind."
16066,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I pass it by, to tell that long we tried"
16067,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,To bring our fathers over to our side;
16068,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"’Twas bootless on their wives our skill to try,"
16069,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"For one would not, and one in vain, comply."
16070,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“First I began my father’s heart to move,"
16071,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,By boldly saying ‘We are born to love;’
16072,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My father answer’d, with an air of ease,"
16073,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,‘Well! very well! be loving if you please!
16074,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Except a man insults us or offends,                      180"
16075,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,In my opinion we should all be friends.’
16076,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“This gain’d me nothing; little would accrue
16077,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,From clearing points so useless though so true;
16078,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But with some pains I brought him to confess,"
16079,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That to forgive our wrongs is to redress.
16080,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘It might be so,’ he answer’d, yet with doubt"
16081,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That it might not; ‘but what is this about?’
16082,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I dared not speak directly, but I strove"
16083,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To keep my subjects, harmony and love."
16084,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Coolly my father look’d, and much enjoy’d             190"
16085,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The broken eloquence his eye destroy’d;
16086,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Yet less confused, and more resolved at last,"
16087,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,With bolder effort to my point I past;
16088,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And, fondly speaking of my peerless maid,                }"
16089,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I call’d her worth and beauty to my aid;                 }
16090,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘Then make her mine!’ I said, and for his favour pray’d. }"
16091,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“My father’s look was one I seldom saw;
16092,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"It gave no pleasure, nor created awe:"
16093,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It was the kind of cool contemptuous smile
16094,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of witty persons, overcharged with bile;                 200"
16095,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"At first he spoke not, nor at last to me--"
16096,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘Well now, and what if such a thing could be?"
16097,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"What, if the boy should his addresses pay"
16098,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To the tall girl, would that old tory say?"
16099,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I have no hatred to the dog--but, still,"
16100,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It was some pleasure when I used him ill;
16101,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"This I must lose if we should brethren be,"
16102,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Yet may be not, for brethren disagree;"
16103,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The fool is right--there is no bar in life
16104,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Against their marriage--let her be his wife.--          210
16105,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Well, sir, you hear me!’--Never man complied,"
16106,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And left a beggar so dissatisfied;
16107,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Though all was granted, yet was grace refused;  }"
16108,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I felt as one indulged, and yet abused;         }"
16109,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And yet, although provoked, I was not unamused. }"
16110,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“In a reply like this appear’d to meet
16111,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"All that encourage hope, and that defeat;"
16112,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Consent, though cool, had been for me enough,"
16113,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But this consent had something of reproof;
16114,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I had prepared my answer to his rage,                    220"
16115,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,With his contempt I thought not to engage.
16116,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I, like a hero, would my castle storm,"
16117,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And meet the giant in his proper form;
16118,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Then, conquering him, would set my princess free:"
16119,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,This would a trial and a triumph be--
16120,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When lo! a sneering menial brings the keys,"
16121,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And cries in scorn, ‘Come, enter, if you please;"
16122,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"You’ll find the lady sitting on her bed,"
16123,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And ’tis expected that you woo and wed.’
16124,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“Yet not so easy was my conquest found;                230
16125,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I met with trouble ere with triumph crown’d.
16126,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Triumph, alas!--My father little thought,"
16127,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A king at home, how other minds are wrought;"
16128,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"True, his meek neighbour was a gentle squire,"
16129,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And had a soul averse from wrath and ire;
16130,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"He answer’d frankly, when to him I went,"
16131,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘I give you little, sir, in my consent.’"
16132,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"He and my mother were to us inclined,"
16133,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The powerless party with the peaceful mind;
16134,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But that meek man was destined to obey                   240
16135,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A sovereign lady’s unremitted sway,"
16136,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Who bore no partial, no divided rule;"
16137,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,All were obedient pupils in her school.
16138,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"She had religious zeal, both strong and sour,"
16139,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That gave an active sternness to her power;
16140,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But few could please her--she herself was one
16141,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,By whom that deed was very seldom done.
16142,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"With such a being, so disposed to feed"
16143,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Contempt and scorn--how was I to succeed?
16144,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But love commanded, and I made my prayer                 250"
16145,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To the stern lady, with an humble air,"
16146,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Said all that lovers hope, all measures tried"
16147,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That love suggested, and bow’d down to pride."
16148,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“Yes! I have now the tygress in my eye--
16149,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When I had ceased and waited her reply,"
16150,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A pause ensued; and then she slowly rose,"
16151,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"With bitter smile predictive of my woes,"
16152,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,A look she saw was plainly understood----
16153,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘Admire my daughter! Sir, you’re very good."
16154,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The girl is decent, take her all in all--     }          260"
16155,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Genteel, we hope--perhaps a thought too tall; }"
16156,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,A daughter’s portion hers--you’ll think her   }
16157,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,fortune small.                     }
16158,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Perhaps her uncles, in a cause so good,"
16159,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Would do a little for their flesh and blood;
16160,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"We are not ill allied--and, say we make"
16161,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Her portion decent, whither would you take?"
16162,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Is there some cottage on your father’s ground,"
16163,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Where may a dwelling for the girl be found?
16164,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Or a small farm--your mother understands
16165,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,How to make useful such a pair of hands.                 270
16166,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘But this we drop at present, if you please;"
16167,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,We shall have leisure for such things as these;
16168,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,They will be proper ere you fix the day
16169,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,For the poor girl to honour and obey;
16170,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,At present therefore we may put an end
16171,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To our discourse--Good morrow to you, friend!’"
16172,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Then, with a solemn curtesy and profound,          }"
16173,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Her laughing eye she lifted from the ground,          }"
16174,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And left me lost in thought, and gazing idly round.-- }"
16175,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Still we had hope, and, growing bold in time,         280"
16176,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I would engage the father in our crime;
16177,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But he refused, for, though he wish’d us well,"
16178,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"He said, ‘he must not make his house a hell;’--"
16179,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And sure the meaning look that I convey’d
16180,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Did not inform him that the hell was made.
16181,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“Still hope existed that a mother’s heart
16182,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Would in a daughter’s feelings take a part;
16183,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nor was it vain--for there is found access
16184,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To a hard heart, in time of its distress."
16185,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“The mother sicken’d, and the daughter sigh’d,         290"
16186,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And we petition’d till our queen complied;
16187,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"She thought of dying, and, if power must cease,"
16188,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Better to make, than cause, th’ expected peace;"
16189,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And sure, this kindness mixing with the blood,"
16190,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Its balmy influence caused the body’s good;
16191,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,For as a charm it work’d upon the frame
16192,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Of the reviving and relenting dame;
16193,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"For, when recover’d, she no more opposed"
16194,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Her daughter’s wishes.--Here contention closed.
16195,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Then bliss ensued, so exquisitely sweet,              300"
16196,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That with it once, once only, we can meet;"
16197,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"For, though we love again, and though once more"
16198,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"We feel th’ enlivening hope we felt before,"
16199,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Still the pure freshness of the joy that cast
16200,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Its sweet around us is for ever past.
16201,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"O! time to memory precious--ever dear,               }"
16202,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Though ever painful--this eventful year;             }
16203,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,What bliss is now in view! and now what woes appear! }
16204,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Sweet hours of expectation!--I was gone
16205,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,To the vile town to press our business on;               310
16206,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,To urge its formal instruments--and lo!
16207,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Comes with dire looks a messenger of wo,"
16208,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,With tidings sad as death!--With all my speed
16209,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I reach’d her home!--but that pure soul was freed--
16210,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"She was no more--for ever shut that eye,"
16211,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That look’d all soul, as if it could not die;"
16212,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It could not see me--O! the strange distress   }
16213,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of these new feelings!--misery’s excess,       }"
16214,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,What can describe it? words will not express.  }
16215,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When I look back upon that dreadful scene,               320"
16216,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I feel renew’d the anguish that has been,"
16217,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And reason trembles----Yes! you bid me cease,"
16218,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nor try to think; but I will think in peace.--
16219,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Unbid and unforbidden, to the room"
16220,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I went, a gloomy wretch amid that gloom;"
16221,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And there the lovely being on her bed
16222,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Shrouded and cold was laid--Maria dead!
16223,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,There was I left--and I have now no thought
16224,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Remains with me, how fear or fancy wrought;"
16225,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I know I gazed upon the marble cheek,                    330"
16226,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And pray’d the dear departed girl to speak--
16227,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Further I know not, for, till years were fled,"
16228,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,All was extinguish’d--all with her was dead.
16229,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I had a general terror, dread of all"
16230,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That could a thinking, feeling man befall;"
16231,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I was desirous from myself to run,"
16232,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And something, but I knew not what, to shun."
16233,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,There was a blank from this I cannot fill;
16234,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It is a puzzle and a terror still.
16235,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Yet did I feel some intervals of bliss,                  340"
16236,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Ev’n with the horrors of a fate like this;
16237,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And dreams of wonderful construction paid
16238,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,For waking horror--dear angelic maid!
16239,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“When peace return’d, unfelt for many a year,"
16240,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And hope, discarded flatterer, dared t’ appear;"
16241,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I heard of my estate, how free from debt,"
16242,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And of the comforts life afforded yet;
16243,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Beside that best of comforts in a life
16244,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,So sad as mine--a fond and faithful wife.
16245,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My gentle mother, now a widow, made                      350"
16246,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,These strong attempts to guide me or persuade.
16247,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘Much time is lost,’ she said, ‘but yet my son"
16248,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"May, in the race of life, have much to run;"
16249,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When I am gone, thy life to thee will seem"
16250,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Lonely and sad, a melancholy dream;"
16251,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Get thee a wife--I will not say to love,"
16252,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But one, a friend in thy distress to prove;"
16253,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,One who will kindly help thee to sustain
16254,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Thy spirit’s burden in its hours of pain:
16255,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Say, will you marry?’--I in haste replied,               360"
16256,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,‘And who would be the self-devoted bride?
16257,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,There is a melancholy power that reigns
16258,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Tyrant within me--who would bear his chains,"
16259,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And hear them clicking every wretched hour,"
16260,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"With will to aid me, but without the power?"
16261,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But if such one were found with easy mind,"
16262,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Who would not ask for raptures--I’m resign’d.’
16263,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘’Tis quite enough,’ my gentle mother cried;"
16264,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘We leave the raptures, and will find the bride.’"
16265,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“There was a lady near us, quite discreet,             370"
16266,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Whom in our visits ’twas our chance to meet:
16267,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"One grave and civil, who had no desire"
16268,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That men should praise her beauties or admire;
16269,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"She in our walks would sometimes take my arm,"
16270,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But had no foolish fluttering or alarm;
16271,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"She wish’d no heart to wound, no truth to prove,"
16272,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And seem’d, like me, as one estranged from love;"
16273,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My mother praised her, and with so much skill,"
16274,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,She gave a certain bias to my will;
16275,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But calm indeed our courtship; I profess’d               380
16276,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,A due regard--My mother did the rest:
16277,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Who soon declared that we should love, and grow"
16278,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,As fond a couple as the world could show;
16279,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And talk’d of boys and girls with so much glee,"
16280,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That I began to wish the thing could be.
16281,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Still, when the day that soon would come was named,"
16282,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I felt a cold fit, and was half ashamed;"
16283,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But we too far proceeded to revoke,"
16284,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And had been much too serious for a joke;
16285,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I shook away the fear that man annoys,                   390"
16286,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And thought a little of the girls and boys.
16287,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“A week remain’d--for seven succeeding days
16288,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nor man nor woman might control my ways;
16289,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,For seven dear nights I might to rest retire
16290,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"At my own time, and none the cause require;"
16291,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"For seven blest days I might go in and out,"
16292,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And none demand, ‘Sir, what are you about?’"
16293,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,For one whole week I might at will discourse
16294,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"On any subject, with a freeman’s force."
16295,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Thus while I thought, I utter’d, as men sing          400"
16296,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"In under-voice, reciting ‘With this ring;’"
16297,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That, when the hour should come, I might not dread"
16298,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"These, or the words that follow’d, ‘I thee wed.’"
16299,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Such was my state of mind, exulting now"
16300,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And then depress’d--I cannot tell you how--
16301,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When a poor lady, whom her friends could send"
16302,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"On any message, a convenient friend,"
16303,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Who had all feelings of her own o’ercome,"
16304,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And could pronounce to any man his doom;
16305,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Whose heart indeed was marble, but whose face            410"
16306,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Assumed the look adapted to the case,"
16307,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Enter’d my room, commission’d to assuage"
16308,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"What was foreseen, my sorrow and my rage."
16309,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“It seem’d the lady whom I could prefer,"
16310,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And could my much-loved freedom lose for her,"
16311,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Had bold attempts, but not successful, made,"
16312,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The heart of some rich cousin to invade;
16313,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Who, half resisting, half complying, kept"
16314,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A cautious distance, and the business slept."
16315,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“This prudent swain his own importance knew,           420"
16316,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And swore to part the now affianced two.
16317,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Fill’d with insidious purpose, forth he went,"
16318,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Profess’d his love, and woo’d her to consent."
16319,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,‘Ah! were it true!’ she sigh’d; he boldly swore
16320,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"His love sincere, and mine was sought no more."
16321,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“All this the witch at dreadful length reveal’d,"
16322,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And begg’d me calmly to my fate to yield:
16323,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Much pains she took engagements old to state,"
16324,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And hoped to hear me curse my cruel fate,"
16325,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Threat’ning my luckless life; and thought it strange     430
16326,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,In me to bear the unexpected change;
16327,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"In my calm feelings she beheld disguise,"
16328,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And told of some strange wildness in my eyes.
16329,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“But there was nothing in the eye amiss,"
16330,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And the heart calmly bore a stroke like this.
16331,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Not so my mother; though of gentle kind,"
16332,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,She could no mercy for the creature find.
16333,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘Vile plot!’ she said.--‘But, madam, if they plot,"
16334,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And you would have revenge, disturb them not.’--"
16335,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘What can we do, my son?’--‘Consult our ease,         440"
16336,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And do just nothing, madam, if you please.’--"
16337,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“‘What will be said?’--‘We need not that discuss;
16338,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Our friends and neighbours will do that for us.’--
16339,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘Do you so lightly, son, your loss sustain?’--"
16340,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘Nay, my dear madam, but I count it gain.’--"
16341,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“‘The world will blame us sure, if we be still.’--"
16342,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘And, if we stir, you may be sure it will.’--"
16343,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“‘Not to such loss your father had agreed.’--
16344,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘No, for my father’s had been loss indeed.’"
16345,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“With gracious smile my mother gave assent,            450"
16346,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And let th’ affair slip by with much content.
16347,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Some old dispute, the lover meant should rise,"
16348,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Some point of strife they could not compromise,"
16349,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Displeased the squire--he from the field withdrew,"
16350,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Not quite conceal’d, not fully placed in view;"
16351,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But half advancing, half retreating, kept"
16352,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"At his old distance, and the business slept."
16353,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Six years had past, and forty ere the six,"
16354,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,When Time began to play his usual tricks:
16355,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The locks once comely in a virgin’s sight,               460"
16356,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Locks of pure brown, display’d th’ encroaching white;"
16357,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The blood once fervid now to cool began,"
16358,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And Time’s strong pressure to subdue the man.
16359,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I rode or walk’d as I was wont before,"
16360,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But now the bounding spirit was no more;
16361,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A moderate pace would now my body heat,"
16362,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,A walk of moderate length distress my feet.
16363,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I show’d my stranger-guest those hills sublime,"
16364,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But said, ‘the view is poor, we need not climb.’"
16365,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,At a friend’s mansion I began to dread                   470
16366,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The cold neat parlour, and the gay glazed bed;"
16367,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"At home I felt a more decided taste,"
16368,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And must have all things in my order placed;
16369,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I ceased to hunt, my horses pleased me less,"
16370,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,My dinner more; I learn’d to play at chess;
16371,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I took my dog and gun, but saw the brute"
16372,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Was disappointed that I did not shoot;
16373,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My morning walks I now could bear to lose,"
16374,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And bless’d the shower that gave me not to choose:
16375,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"In fact, I felt a languor stealing on;                   480"
16376,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The active arm, the agile hand were gone;"
16377,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Small daily actions into habits grew,"
16378,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And new dislike to forms and fashion new;
16379,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I loved my trees in order to dispose,               }"
16380,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I number’d peaches, look’d how stocks arose,        }"
16381,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Told the same story oft--in short, began to prose.  }"
16382,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“My books were changed; I now preferred the truth
16383,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,To the light reading of unsettled youth;
16384,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Novels grew tedious, but, by choice or chance,"
16385,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I still had interest in the wild romance.                490
16386,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"There is an age, we know, when tales of love"
16387,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Form the sweet pabulum our hearts approve;
16388,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Then as we read we feel, and are indeed,"
16389,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"We judge, th’ heroic men of whom we read;"
16390,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But in our after life these fancies fail;
16391,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,We cannot be the heroes of the tale;
16392,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The parts that Cliffords, Mordaunts, Bevilles play"
16393,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,We cannot--cannot be so smart and gay.
16394,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“But all the mighty deeds and matchless powers
16395,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of errant knights we never fancied ours,                 500"
16396,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And thus the prowess of each gifted knight
16397,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Must at all times create the same delight;
16398,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Lovelace a forward youth might hope to seem,"
16399,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But Lancelot never--that he could not dream;
16400,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nothing reminds us in the magic page
16401,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of old romance, of our declining age."
16402,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"If once our fancy mighty dragons slew,"
16403,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,This is no more than fancy now can do;
16404,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But when the heroes of a novel come,"
16405,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Conquer’d and conquering, to a drawing-room,             510"
16406,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,We no more feel the vanity that sees
16407,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Within ourselves what we admire in these;
16408,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And so we leave the modern tale, to fly"
16409,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,From realm to realm with Tristram or Sir Guy.
16410,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Not quite a Quixote, I could not suppose"
16411,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That queens would call me to subdue their foes;
16412,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But, by a voluntary weakness sway’d,"
16413,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When fancy call’d, I willingly obey’d."
16414,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Such I became, and I believed my heart"
16415,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Might yet be pierced by some peculiar dart               520
16416,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of right heroic kind, and I could prove"
16417,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Fond of some peerless nymph who deign’d to love,"
16418,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Some high-soul’d virgin, who had spent her time"
16419,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"In studies grave, heroic and sublime;"
16420,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Who would not like me less that I had spent
16421,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Years eight and forty, just the age of Kent--"
16422,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But not with Kent’s discretion, for I grew"
16423,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Fond of a creature whom my fancy drew:
16424,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,A kind of beings who are never found
16425,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"On middle-earth, but grow on fairy-ground.               530"
16426,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“These found I not; but I had luck to find
16427,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,A mortal woman of this fairy kind;
16428,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A thin, tall, upright, serious, slender maid,"
16429,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Who in my own romantic regions stray’d;
16430,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"From the world’s glare to this sweet vale retired,"
16431,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To dwell unseen, unsullied, unadmired;"
16432,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"In all her virgin excellence, above"
16433,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The gaze of crowds, and hopes of vulgar love."
16434,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“We spoke of noble deeds in happier times,"
16435,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of glorious virtues, of debasing crimes.                 540"
16436,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Warm was the season, and the subject too,"
16437,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And therefore warm in our discourse we grew.
16438,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Love made such haste, that ere a month was flown"
16439,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Since first we met, he had us for his own:"
16440,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Riches are trifles in an hero’s sight,"
16441,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And lead to questions low and unpolite;
16442,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I nothing said of money or of land,"
16443,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But bent my knee, and fondly ask’d her hand;"
16444,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And the dear lady, with a grace divine,"
16445,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Gave it, and frankly answer’d, ‘it is thine.’            550"
16446,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Our reading was not to romance confined,"
16447,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But still it gave its colour to the mind;
16448,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Gave to our studies something of its force,"
16449,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And made profound and tender our discourse;
16450,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Our subjects all, and our religion, took"
16451,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The grave and solemn spirit of our book;
16452,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And who had seen us walk, or heard us read,"
16453,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Would say, ‘these lovers are sublime indeed.’"
16454,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“I knew not why, but when the day was named"
16455,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,My ardent wishes felt a little tamed;                    560
16456,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My mother’s sickness then awaked my grief,"
16457,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And yet, to own the truth, was some relief;"
16458,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It left uncertain that decisive time
16459,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That made my feelings nervous and sublime.
16460,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Still all was kindness, and at morn and eve"
16461,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I made a visit, talk’d, and took my leave:"
16462,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Kind were the lady’s looks, her eyes were bright,"
16463,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And swam, I thought, in exquisite delight;"
16464,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A lovely red suffused the virgin cheek,"
16465,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And spoke more plainly than the tongue could speak;      570
16466,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Plainly all seem’d to promise love and joy,"
16467,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nor fear’d we ought that might our bliss destroy.
16468,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Engaged by business, I one morn delay’d"
16469,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,My usual call on the accomplish’d maid;
16470,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But soon, that small impediment removed,"
16471,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I paid the visit that decisive proved;
16472,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"For the fair lady had, with grieving heart,"
16473,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"So I believed, retired to sigh apart:"
16474,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I saw her friend, and begg’d her to entreat"
16475,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,My gentle nymph her sighing swain to meet.               580
16476,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“The gossip gone--What dæmon, in his spite        }"
16477,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To love and man, could my frail mind excite,        }"
16478,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And lead me curious on, against all sense of right? }"
16479,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"There met my eye, unclosed, a closet’s door--"
16480,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Shame! how could I the secrets there explore?
16481,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Pride, honour, friendship, love, condemn’d the deed,"
16482,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And yet, in spite of all, I could proceed!"
16483,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I went, I saw--Shall I describe the hoard"
16484,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Of precious worth in seal’d deposits stored
16485,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of sparkling hues? Enough--enough is told,               590"
16486,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,’Tis not for man such mysteries to unfold.
16487,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Thus far I dare--Whene’er those orbits swam
16488,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"In that blue liquid that restrain’d their flame,"
16489,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,As showers the sunbeams--when the crimson glow
16490,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of the red rose o’erspread those cheeks of snow,"
16491,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I saw, but not the cause--’twas not the red"
16492,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Of transient blush that o’er her face was spread;
16493,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"’Twas not the lighter red, that partly streaks"
16494,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The Catherine pear, that brighten’d o’er her cheeks,"
16495,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nor scarlet blush of shame--but such disclose            600
16496,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The velvet petals of the Austrian rose,"
16497,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When first unfolded: warm the glowing hue,"
16498,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Nor cold as rouge, but deep’ning on the view."
16499,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Such were those cheeks--the causes unexplored
16500,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Were now detected in that secret hoard;
16501,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And ever to that rich recess would turn
16502,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My mind, and cause for such effect discern."
16503,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Such was my fortune, O! my friends, and such"
16504,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The end of lofty hopes that grasp’d too much.
16505,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"This was, indeed, a trying time in life,                 610"
16506,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I lost at once a mother and a wife;
16507,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Yet compensation came in time for these,"
16508,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And what I lost in joy, I gain’d in ease.”--"
16509,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“But,” said the squire, “did thus your courtship cease?"
16510,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Resign’d your mistress her betroth’d in peace?”--
16511,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Yes; and had sense her feelings to restrain,"
16512,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nor ask’d me once my conduct to explain;
16513,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But me she saw those swimming eyes explore,"
16514,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And explanation she required no more.
16515,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Friend to the last, I left her with regret--            620"
16516,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Nay, leave her not, for we are neighbours yet."
16517,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“These views extinct, I travell’d, not with taste,"
16518,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But so that time ran wickedly to waste;
16519,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I penn’d some notes, and might a book have made,"
16520,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But I had no connexion with the trade;
16521,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Bridges and churches, towers and halls, I saw,"
16522,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Maids and madonnas, and could sketch and draw:"
16523,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Yes, I had made a book, but that my pride"
16524,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,In the not making was more gratified.
16525,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“There was one feeling upon foreign ground,            630"
16526,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That more distressing than the rest was found:
16527,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That, though with joy I should my country see,"
16528,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,There none had pleasure in expecting me.
16529,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“I now was sixty, but could walk and eat;"
16530,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My food was pleasant, and my slumbers sweet;"
16531,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But what could urge me at a day so late
16532,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,To think of women?--my unlucky fate.
16533,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"It was not sudden; I had no alarms,"
16534,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But was attack’d when resting on my arms;
16535,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Like the poor soldier: when the battle raged             640
16536,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The man escaped, though twice or thrice engaged;"
16537,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But, when it ended, in a quiet spot"
16538,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"He fell, the victim of a random-shot."
16539,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“With my good friend the vicar oft I spent
16540,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The evening hours in quiet, as I meant;"
16541,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"He was a friend in whom, although untried"
16542,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"By ought severe, I found I could confide;"
16543,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"A pleasant, sturdy disputant was he,                  }"
16544,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Who had a daughter--such the Fates decree,            }"
16545,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To prove how weak is man--poor yielding man, like me. }"
16546,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Time after time the maid went out and in,             651"
16547,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Ere love was yet beginning to begin;
16548,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The first awakening proof, the early doubt,"
16549,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Rose from observing she went in and out.
16550,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"My friend, though careless, seem’d my mind to explore,"
16551,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,‘Why do you look so often at the door?’
16552,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I then was cautious, but it did no good,"
16553,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"For she, at least, my meanings understood;"
16554,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But to the vicar nothing she convey’d
16555,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Of what she thought--she did not feel afraid.            660
16556,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“I must confess, this creature in her mind"
16557,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Nor face had beauty that a man would blind;
16558,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"No poet of her matchless charms would write,"
16559,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Yet sober praise they fairly would excite.
16560,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,She was a creature form’d man’s heart to make
16561,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Serenely happy, not to pierce and shake;"
16562,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"If she were tried for breaking human hearts,"
16563,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Men would acquit her--she had not the arts.
16564,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Yet without art, at first without design,"
16565,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,She soon became the arbitress of mine;                   670
16566,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Without pretensions--nay, without pretence,"
16567,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But by a native strange intelligence
16568,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Women possess when they behold a man
16569,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Whom they can tease, and are assured they can;"
16570,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Then ’tis their soul’s delight and pride to reign          }

16572,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And stretch and loose by turns the weighty viewless chain, }"
16573,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Though much she knew, yet nothing could she prove;"
16574,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I had not yet confess’d the crime of love;
16575,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But, in an hour when guardian-angels sleep,              680"
16576,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I fail’d the secret of my soul to keep;
16577,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And then I saw the triumph in those eyes
16578,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That spoke--‘Ay, now you are indeed my prize.’"
16579,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I almost thought I saw compassion, too,"
16580,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,For all the cruel things she meant to do.
16581,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Well I can call to mind the managed air
16582,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That gave no comfort, that brought no despair,"
16583,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That in a dubious balance held the mind,"
16584,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To each side turning, never much inclined."
16585,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“She spoke with kindness--thought the honour high,     690"
16586,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And knew not how to give a fit reply;
16587,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"She could not, would not, dared not, must not deem"
16588,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Such language proof of ought but my esteem;
16589,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It made her proud--she never could forget
16590,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,My partial thoughts--she felt her much in debt:
16591,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,She who had never in her life indulged
16592,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The thought of hearing what I now divulged:
16593,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"I, who had seen so many and so much--"
16594,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,It was an honour--she would deem it such.
16595,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Our different years, indeed, would put an end      }     700"
16596,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To other views, but still her father’s friend      }"
16597,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To her, she humbly hoped, would his regard extend. }"
16598,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Thus, saying nothing, all she meant to say,"
16599,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,She play’d the part the sex delights to play;
16600,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Now by some act of kindness giving scope
16601,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"To the new workings of excited hope,"
16602,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Then by an air of something like disdain,"
16603,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But scarcely seen, repelling it again;"
16604,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Then for a season, neither cold nor kind,"
16605,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"She kept a sort of balance in the mind,                  710"
16606,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And, as his pole a dancer on the rope,"
16607,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The equal poise on both sides kept me up.
16608,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“Is it not strange that man can fairly view
16609,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Pursuit like this, and yet his point pursue;"
16610,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"While he the folly fairly will confess,"
16611,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And even feel the danger of success?
16612,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But so it is, and nought the Circes care"
16613,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"How ill their victims with their poison fare,"
16614,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"When thus they trifle, and with quiet soul"
16615,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Mix their ingredients in the maddening bowl:             720
16616,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Their high regard, the softness of their air,"
16617,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"The pitying grief that saddens at a prayer,"
16618,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Their grave petitions for the peace of mind
16619,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That they determine you shall never find,"
16620,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And all their vain amazement that a man
16621,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Like you should love--they wonder how you can.
16622,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“For months the idler play’d her wicked part,"
16623,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Then fairly gave the secret of her heart.
16624,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,‘She hoped’--I now the smiling gipsy view--
16625,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,‘Her father’s friend would be her lover’s too;           730
16626,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Young Henry Gale’--‘But why delay so long?’--
16627,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"‘She could not tell--she fear’d it might be wrong,"
16628,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But I was good’--I knew not, I was weak,"
16629,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And spoke as love directed me to speak.
16630,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“When in my arms their boy and girl I take,"
16631,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I feel a fondness for the mother’s sake;
16632,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But though the dears some softening thoughts excite,"
16633,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,I have no wishes for the father’s right.
16634,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“Now all is quiet, and the mind sustains"
16635,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Its proper comforts, its befitting pains;                740"
16636,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,The heart reposes; it has had its share             }
16637,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Of love, as much as it could fairly bear;           }"
16638,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,And what is left in life that now demands its care? }
16639,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"“For O! my friends, if this were all indeed;"
16640,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,Could we believe that nothing would succeed;
16641,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"If all were but this daily dose of life,"
16642,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Without a care or comfort, child or wife;"
16643,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,These walks for health with nothing more in view;
16644,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"This doing nothing, and with labour too;"
16645,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,This frequent asking when ’tis time to dine;             750
16646,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,This daily dosing o’er the news and wine;
16647,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"This age’s riddle, when each day appears"
16648,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"So very long, so very short the years;"
16649,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,If this were all--but let me not suppose--                      }
16650,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"What then were life! whose virtues, trials, woes,               }"
16651,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Would sleep th’ eternal sleep, and there the scene would close. }"
16652,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,“This cannot be--but why has Time a pace
16653,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,That seems unequal in our mortal race?
16654,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Quick is that pace in early life, but slow,"
16655,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Tedious and heavy, as we older grow;                     760"
16656,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"But yet, though slow, the movements are alike,"
16657,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And with no force upon the memory strike,"
16658,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And therefore tedious as we find them all,"
16659,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,They leave us nothing we in view recal;
16660,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,But days that we so dull and heavy knew
16661,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"Are now as moments passing in review,"
16662,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"And hence arises ancient men’s report,"
16663,_THE OLD BACHELOR._,"That days are tedious, and yet years are short.”"

16693,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Three days remain’d their friend, and then again"
16694,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The Brothers left themselves to entertain;
16695,_THE MAID’S STORY._,When spake the younger--“It would please me well
16696,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To hear thy spinster-friend her story tell;
16697,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And our attention would be nobly paid
16698,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Thus to compare the Bachelor and Maid.”
16699,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Frank as she is,” replied the squire, “nor one"
16700,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Is more disposed to show what she has done
16701,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With time, or time with her: yet all her care"
16702,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And every trial she might not declare                     10
16703,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To one a stranger; but to me, her friend,"
16704,_THE MAID’S STORY._,She has the story of those trials penn’d;
16705,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"These shalt thou hear, for well the maid I know,"
16706,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And will her efforts and her conquests show.
16707,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Jacques is abroad, and we alone shall dine,"
16708,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And then to give this lady’s tale be mine;
16709,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Thou wilt attend to this good spinster’s life,"
16710,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And grieve and wonder she is not a wife;
16711,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But if we judge by either words or looks,"
16712,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her mode of life, her morals, or her books,               20"
16713,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her pure devotion, unaffected sense,"
16714,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her placid air, her mild benevolence,"
16715,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her gay good humour, and her manners free,"
16716,_THE MAID’S STORY._,She is as happy as a maid can be;
16717,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"If as a wife, I know not, and decline"
16718,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Question like this, till I can judge of thine.”"
16719,_THE MAID’S STORY._,
16720,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Then from a secret hoard drew forth the squire     }
16721,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"His tale, and said, “Attention I require--           }"

16746,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Have not one friend,” my mother cried, “not one;       50"
16747,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That bane of our romantic triflers shun;
16748,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Suppose her true, can she afford you aid?"
16749,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Suppose her false, your purpose is betray’d;"
16750,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And then in dubious points, and matters nice,"

16757,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"You cannot, child, afford to have a heart."
16758,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Think nothing of it; to yourself be true,"
16759,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And keep life’s first great business in your view--
16760,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Take it, dear Martha, for a useful rule,"
16761,_THE MAID’S STORY._,She who is poor is ugly or a fool;
16762,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Or, worse than either, has a bosom fill’d"
16763,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With soft emotions, and with raptures thrill’d."
16764,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Read not too much, nor write in verse or prose,"
16765,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For then you make the dull and foolish foes;
16766,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yet those who do deride not nor condemn,                  70"
16767,_THE MAID’S STORY._,It is not safe to raise up foes in them;
16768,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For though they harm you not, as blockheads do,"
16769,_THE MAID’S STORY._,There is some malice in the scribbling crew.”
16770,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Such her advice; full hard with her had dealt
16771,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The world, and she the usage keenly felt."
16772,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Keep your good name,” she said, “and that to keep"
16773,_THE MAID’S STORY._,You must not suffer vigilance to sleep.
16774,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Some have, perhaps, the name of chaste retain’d,"
16775,_THE MAID’S STORY._,When nought of chastity itself remain’d;
16776,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But there is danger--few have means to blind              80
16777,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The keen-eyed world, and none to make it kind."
16778,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“And one thing more--to free yourself from foes
16779,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Never a secret to your friend disclose;
16780,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Secrets with girls, like loaded guns with boys,"
16781,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Are never valued till they make a noise;
16782,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To show how trusted, they their power display;"
16783,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To show how worthy, they the trust betray;"
16784,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Like pence in children’s pockets secrets lie
16785,_THE MAID’S STORY._,In female bosoms--they must burn or fly.
16786,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Let not your heart be soften’d; if it be,              90"
16787,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Let not the man his softening influence see;
16788,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For the most fond will sometimes tyrants prove,"

16793,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Such were my mother’s cares to mend my lot,"
16794,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And such her pupil they succeeded not.
16795,_THE MAID’S STORY._,It was conceived the person I had then
16796,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Might lead to serious thoughts some wealthy men,         100"
16797,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who, having none their purpose to oppose,"
16798,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Would soon be won their wishes to disclose.
16799,_THE MAID’S STORY._,My mother thought I was the very child
16800,_THE MAID’S STORY._,By whom the old and amorous are beguiled:
16801,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"So mildly gay, so ignorantly fair,"
16802,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And pure, no doubt, as sleeping infants are;"
16803,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then I had lessons how to look and move,"
16804,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, I repeat, make merchandize of love."
16805,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Thrice it was tried if one so young could bring
16806,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Old wary men to buy the binding ring;                    110
16807,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And on the taper finger, to whose tip"
16808,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The fond old swain would press his withering lip,"
16809,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Place the strong charm:--and one would win my heart
16810,_THE MAID’S STORY._,By re-assuming youth--a trying part;
16811,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Girls, he supposed, all knew the young were bold,"
16812,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And he would show that spirit in the old;
16813,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In boys they loved to hear the rattling tongue,"
16814,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And he would talk as idly as the young;
16815,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He knew the vices our Lotharios boast,"
16816,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And he would show of every vice the ghost,               120"
16817,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The evil’s self, without disguise or dress,"
16818,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Vice in its own pure native ugliness:
16819,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Not, as the drunkenness of slaves, to prove"
16820,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Vice hateful, but that seeing, I might love."
16821,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He drove me out, and I was pleased to see"
16822,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Care of himself: it served as care for me;
16823,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For he would tell me, that he should not spare"
16824,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Man, horse, or carriage, if I were not there:"
16825,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Provoked at last, my malice I obey’d,"
16826,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And smiling said, “Sir, I am not afraid.”                130"
16827,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"This check’d his spirit; but he said, “Could you"
16828,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Have charge so rich, you would be careful too.”"
16829,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And he, indeed, so very slowly drove,"
16830,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That we dismiss’d the over-cautious love.
16831,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My next admirer was of equal age,                }"
16832,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And wish’d the child’s affection to engage,        }"
16833,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And keep the fluttering bird a victim in his cage. }
16834,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He had no portion of his rival’s glee,"
16835,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But gravely praised the gravity in me;
16836,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Religious, moral, both in word and deed,                 140"
16837,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But warmly disputatious in his creed;
16838,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Wild in his younger time, as we were told,"
16839,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And therefore like a penitent when old.
16840,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Strange he should wish a lively girl to look
16841,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Upon the methods his repentance took!
16842,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then he would say, he was no more a rake"
16843,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To squander money for his passions’ sake;
16844,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yet, upon proper terms, as man discreet,"
16845,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He with my mother was disposed to treat,"
16846,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To whom he told, “the price of beauty fell               150"
16847,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In every market, and but few could sell;"
16848,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That trade in India, once alive and brisk,"
16849,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Was over done, and scarcely worth the risk.”"
16850,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then stoop’d to speak of board, and what for life"

16852,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Hardly he bargain’d, and so much desired,"
16853,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That we demurr’d; and he, displeased, retired."
16854,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And now I hoped to rest, nor act again"
16855,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The paltry part for which I felt disdain,"
16856,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When a third lover came within our view,                 160"
16857,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And somewhat differing from the former two.
16858,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He had been much abroad, and he had seen"
16859,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The world’s weak side, and read the hearts of men;"
16860,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But all, it seem’d, this study could produce,"
16861,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Was food for spleen, derision, and abuse;"
16862,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He levell’d all, as one who had intent"
16863,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To clear the vile and spot the innocent;
16864,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He praised my sense, and said I ought to be"
16865,_THE MAID’S STORY._,From girl’s restraint and nursery maxims free;
16866,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He praised my mother; but he judged her wrong            170
16867,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To keep us from th’ admiring world so long;
16868,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He praised himself; and then his vices named,"
16869,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And call’d them follies, and was not ashamed."
16870,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He more than hinted that the lessons taught
16871,_THE MAID’S STORY._,By priests were all with superstition fraught;
16872,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And I must think them for the crowd design’d,"
16873,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Not to alarm the free and liberal mind.
16874,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Wisdom with him was virtue. They were wrong
16875,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And weak, he said, who went not with the throng;"
16876,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Man must his passions order and restrain                 180
16877,_THE MAID’S STORY._,In all that gives his fellow-subjects pain;
16878,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But yet of guilt he would in pity speak,"
16879,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And as he judged, the wicked were the weak."
16880,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Such was the lover of a simple maid,"
16881,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who seem’d to call his logic to his aid,"
16882,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And to mean something; I will not pretend
16883,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To judge the purpose of my reasoning friend,"
16884,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who was dismiss’d, in quiet to complain"
16885,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That so much labour was bestow’d in vain.
16886,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And now my mother seem’d disposed to try               190
16887,_THE MAID’S STORY._,A life of reason and tranquillity.
16888,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Ere this, her health and spirits were the best,"
16889,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Hers the day’s trifling, and the nightly rest;"
16890,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But something new was in her mind instill’d;
16891,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Unquiet thoughts the matron bosom fill’d;
16892,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For five and forty peaceful years she bore
16893,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her placid looks, and dress becoming wore:"
16894,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She could a compliment with pleasure take,"
16895,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But no absurd impression could it make.
16896,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Now were her nerves disorder’d; she was weak,            200"
16897,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And must the help of a physician seek:
16898,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A Scotch physician, who had just began"
16899,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To settle near us, quite a graceful man,"
16900,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And very clever, with a soft address,"
16901,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That would his meaning tenderly express.
16902,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Sick as my mother seem’d, when he inquired"
16903,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"If she was ill, he found her well attired;"
16904,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She purchased wares so showy and so fine,"
16905,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The venders all believed th’ indulgence mine;--
16906,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But I, who thrice was woo’d, had lovers three,           210"
16907,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Must now again a very infant be;
16908,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"While the good lady, twenty years a wife,"
16909,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was to decide the colour of his life:
16910,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And she decided. She was wont t’ appear
16911,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To these unequal marriages severe;
16912,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her thoughts of such with energy she told,"
16913,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And was repulsive, dignified, and cold;"
16914,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But now, like monarchs weary of a throne,"
16915,_THE MAID’S STORY._,She would no longer reign--at least alone.
16916,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She gave her pulse, and, with a manner sweet,          220"
16917,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Wish’d him to feel how kindly they could beat;
16918,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And ’tis a thing quite wonderful to tell
16919,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"How soon he understood them, and how well."
16920,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Now, when she married, I from home was sent,"
16921,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With grandmamma to keep perpetual Lent;
16922,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For she would take me on conditions cheap,"
16923,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For what we scarcely could a parrot keep:
16924,_THE MAID’S STORY._,A trifle added to the daily fare
16925,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Would feed a maiden who must learn to spare.
16926,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With grandmamma I lived in perfect ease;               230
16927,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Consent to starve, and I was sure to please."
16928,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Full well I knew the painful shifts we made           }
16929,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Expenses all to lessen or evade,                      }"
16930,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And tradesmen’s flinty hearts to soften and persuade. }
16931,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Poor grandmamma among the gentry dwelt
16932,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of a small town, and all the honour felt;"
16933,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Shrinking from all approaches to disgrace
16934,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That might be mark’d in so genteel a place;
16935,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Where every daily deed, as soon as done,            }"
16936,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Ran through the town as fast as it could run--      }    240
16937,_THE MAID’S STORY._,At dinners what appear’d--at cards who lost or won. }
16938,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Our good appearance through the town was known,"
16939,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Hunger and thirst were matters of our own;
16940,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And you would judge that she in scandal dealt
16941,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who told on what we fed, or how we felt."
16942,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"We had a little maid, some four feet high,"
16943,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Who was employ’d our household stores to buy;
16944,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For she would weary every man in trade,"
16945,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And tease t’ assent whom she could not persuade.
16946,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Methinks I see her, with her pigmy light,              250"
16947,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Precede her mistress in a moonless night;
16948,_THE MAID’S STORY._,From the small lantern throwing through the street
16949,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The dimm’d effulgence at her lady’s feet;
16950,_THE MAID’S STORY._,What time she went to prove her well-known skill
16951,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With rival friends at their beloved quadrille.
16952,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“And how’s your pain?” inquired the gentle maid,"
16953,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For that was asking if with luck she play’d;
16954,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And this she answer’d as the cards decreed,"
16955,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“O Biddy! ask not--very bad indeed;”
16956,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Or, in more cheerful tone, from spirit light,            260"
16957,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Why, thank you, Biddy, pretty well to-night.”"
16958,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The good old lady often thought me vain,"
16959,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And of my dress would tenderly complain;
16960,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But liked my taste in food of every kind,"
16961,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"As from all grossness, like her own, refined."
16962,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet when she hinted that on herbs and bread
16963,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Girls of my age and spirit should be fed,"
16964,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Whate’er my age had borne, my flesh and blood,"
16965,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Spirit and strength, the interdict withstood;"
16966,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But, though I might the frugal soul offend               270"
16967,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of the good matron, now my only friend,"
16968,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And though her purse suggested rules so strict,"
16969,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Her love could not the punishment inflict;
16970,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She sometimes watch’d the morsel with a frown,"
16971,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And sigh’d to see, but let it still go down."
16972,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Our butcher’s bill, to me a monstrous sum,"
16973,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Was such that, summon’d, he forbore to come:"
16974,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Proud man was he, and when the bill was paid,"
16975,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He put the money in his bag and play’d,"
16976,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Jerking it up, and catching it again,                    280"
16977,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And poising in his hand in pure disdain;
16978,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"While the good lady, awed by man so proud,"
16979,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And yet disposed to have her claims allow’d,"
16980,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Balanced between humility and pride,"
16981,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Stood a fall’n empress at the butcher’s side,"
16982,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Praising his meat as delicate and nice----
16983,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Yes, madam, yes! if people pay the price.”"
16984,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"So lived the lady, and so murmur’d I,"
16985,_THE MAID’S STORY._,In all the grief of pride and poverty.
16986,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Twice in the year there came a note to tell              290
16987,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"How well mamma, who hoped the child was well;"
16988,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"It was not then a pleasure to be styled,"
16989,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"By a mamma of such experience, ‘Child!’"
16990,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But I suppressed the feelings of my pride,"
16991,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Or other feelings set them all aside.
16992,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"There was a youth from college, just the one"
16993,_THE MAID’S STORY._,I judged mamma would value as a son;
16994,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He was to me good, handsome, learn’d, genteel,"
16995,_THE MAID’S STORY._,I cannot now what then I thought reveal;
16996,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But, in a word, he was the very youth                    300"
16997,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who told me what I judged the very truth,"
16998,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That love like his and charms like mine agreed,"
16999,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For all description they must both exceed.
17000,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet scarcely can I throw a smile on things
17001,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"So painful, but that Time his comfort brings,"
17002,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Or rather throws oblivion on the mind,"
17003,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For we are more forgetful than resign’d.
17004,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"We both were young, had heard of love and read,"
17005,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And could see nothing in the thing to dread,"
17006,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But like a simple pair our time employ’d                 310
17007,_THE MAID’S STORY._,In pleasant views to be in time enjoy’d.
17008,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When Frederick came, the kind old lady smiled"
17009,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To see the youth so taken with her child;
17010,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A nice young man, who came with unsoil’d feet"
17011,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In her best room, and neither drank nor eat."
17012,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Alas! he planted in a vacant breast
17013,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The hopes and fears that robb’d it of its rest.
17014,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"All now appear’d so right, so fair, so just,"
17015,_THE MAID’S STORY._,We surely might the lovely prospect trust;
17016,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Alas! poor Frederick and his charmer found               320
17017,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That they were standing on fallacious ground:
17018,_THE MAID’S STORY._,All that the father of the youth could do
17019,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was done--and now he must himself pursue
17020,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Success in life; and, honest truth to state,"
17021,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He was not fitted for a candidate.
17022,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I, too, had nothing in this world below,"
17023,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Save what a Scotch physician could bestow,"
17024,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Who for a pittance took my mother’s hand;
17025,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, if disposed, what had they to command?"
17026,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But these were after fears, nor came t’ annoy          330"
17027,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The tender children in their dreams of joy;
17028,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who talk’d of glebe and garden, tithe and rent,"
17029,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And how a fancied income should be spent;
17030,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"What friends, what social parties we should see,"
17031,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And live with what genteel economy;
17032,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In fact, we gave our hearts as children give,"
17033,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And thought of living as our neighbours live.
17034,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Now, when assured ourselves that all was well,"
17035,_THE MAID’S STORY._,’Twas right our friends of these designs to tell;
17036,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For this we parted.--Grandmamma, amazed,                 340"
17037,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Upon her child with fond compassion gazed;
17038,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then pious tears appear’d, but not a word"
17039,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In aid of weeping till she cried, “Good Lord!”"
17040,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She then, with hurried motion, sought the stairs,"
17041,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, calling Biddy, bade her come to prayers."
17042,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet the good lady early in her life
17043,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was call’d to vow the duties of a wife;
17044,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She sought the altar by her friends’ advice,"
17045,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"No free-will offering, but a sacrifice;"
17046,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But here a forward girl and eager boy                    350
17047,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Dared talk of life, and turn their heads with joy!"
17048,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To my mamma I wrote in just the way
17049,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I felt, and said what dreaming lasses say:"
17050,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"How handsome Frederick was, by all confess’d,"
17051,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"How well he look’d, how very well he dress’d;"
17052,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With learning much, that would for both provide,"
17053,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"His mother’s darling, and his father’s pride;"
17054,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"‘And then he loves me more than mind can guess,"
17055,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Than heart conceive, or eloquence express.’"
17056,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"No letter came a doubtful mind to ease,                360"
17057,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, what was worse, no Frederick came to please;"
17058,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To college gone--so thought our little maid--
17059,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But not to see me! I was much afraid;
17060,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I walk’d the garden round, and deeply sigh’d,"
17061,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When grandmamma grew faint! and dropt, and died:"
17062,_THE MAID’S STORY._,A fate so awful and so sudden drove
17063,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"All else away, and half extinguish’d love."
17064,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Strange people came; they search’d the house around,"
17065,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, vulgar wretches! sold whate’er they found:"
17066,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The secret hoards that in the drawers were kept,         370"
17067,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The silver toys that with the tokens slept,"
17068,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The precious beads, the corals with their bells,"
17069,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That laid secure, lock’d up in secret cells,"
17070,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The costly silk, the tabby, the brocade,"
17071,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The very garment for the wedding made,"
17072,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Were brought to sale, with many a jest thereon!"
17073,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“Going--a bridal dress--for----Going!--Gone.”
17074,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That ring, dear pledge of early love and true,   }"
17075,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That to the wedded finger almost grew,           }"
17076,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was sold for six and ten-pence to a Jew!         }       380
17077,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Great was the fancied worth; but ah! how small
17078,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The sum thus made, and yet how valued all!"
17079,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But all that to the shameful service went
17080,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Just paid the bills, the burial, and the rent;"
17081,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And I and Biddy, poor deserted maids!"
17082,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Were turn’d adrift to seek for other aids.
17083,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Now left by all the world, as I believed,"
17084,_THE MAID’S STORY._,I wonder’d much that I so little grieved;
17085,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet I was frighten’d at the painful view
17086,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of shiftless want, and saw not what to do.               390"
17087,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In times like this the poor have little dread,"
17088,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"They can but work, and they shall then be fed;"
17089,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And Biddy cheer’d me with such thoughts as this,"
17090,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“You’ll find the poor have their enjoyments, Miss!”"
17091,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Indeed I saw, for Biddy took me home"
17092,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To a forsaken hovel’s cold and gloom;
17093,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And while my tears in plenteous flow were shed,"
17094,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With her own hands she placed her proper bed,"
17095,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Reserved for need. A fire was quickly made,"
17096,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And food, the purchase for the day, display’d;           400"
17097,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She let in air to make the damps retire,"
17098,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Then placed her sad companion at her fire;
17099,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She then began her wonted peace to feel,"
17100,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She [brought] her wool, and sought her favourite wheel;"
17101,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That as she turn’d, she sang with sober glee,"
17102,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Begone, dull Care! I’ll have no more with thee”;"
17103,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then turn’d to me, and bade me weep no more,"
17104,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But try and taste the pleasures of the poor.
17105,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When dinner came, on table brown and bare"
17106,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Were placed the humblest forms of earthen ware,          410"
17107,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With one blue dish, on which our food was placed,"
17108,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For appetite provided, not for taste."
17109,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I look’d disgusted, having lately seen"
17110,_THE MAID’S STORY._,All so minutely delicate and clean;
17111,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yet, as I sate, I found to my surprise"
17112,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A vulgar kind of inclination rise,"
17113,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And near my humble friend, and nearer, drew,"
17114,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Tried the strange food, and was partaker too."
17115,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I walk’d at eve, but not where I was seen,"
17116,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And thought, with sorrow, what can Frederick mean?       420"
17117,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I must not write, I said, for I am poor;"
17118,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And then I wept till I could weep no more.
17119,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Kind-hearted Biddy tried my griefs to heal,"
17120,_THE MAID’S STORY._,This is a nothing to what others feel;
17121,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Life has a thousand sorrows worse than this,"
17122,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A lover lost is not a fortune, Miss!"
17123,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"One goes, another comes, and which is best"
17124,_THE MAID’S STORY._,There is no telling--set your heart at rest.”
17125,_THE MAID’S STORY._,At night we pray’d--I dare not say a word
17126,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of our devotion, it was so absurd;                       430"
17127,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And very pious upon Biddy’s part,"
17128,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But mine were all effusions of the heart;
17129,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"While she her angels call’d their peace to shed,"
17130,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And bless the corners of our little bed.
17131,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"All was a dream! I said, is this indeed           }"
17132,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To be my life? and thus to lodge and feed,        }"
17133,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To pay for what I have, and work for what I need? }"
17134,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Must I be poor? and Frederick, if we meet,"
17135,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Would not so much as know me in the street?
17136,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Or, as he walk’d with ladies, he would try               440"
17137,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To be engaged as we were passing by--
17138,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And then I wept to think that I should grow
17139,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Like them whom he would be ashamed to know.
17140,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"On the third day, while striving with my fate,"
17141,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And hearing Biddy all its comforts state,"
17142,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Talking of all her neighbours, all her schemes,"
17143,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her stories, merry jests, and warning dreams,"
17144,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With tales of mirth and murder--O! the nights
17145,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Past, said the maiden, in such dear delights,"
17146,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And I was thinking, can the time arrive                  450"
17147,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When I shall thus be humbled, and survive?--"
17148,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then I beheld a horse and handsome gig,"
17149,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With the good air, tall form, and comely wig"
17150,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Of Doctor Mackey--I in fear began
17151,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To say, Good heaven, preserve me from the man!"
17152,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But fears ill reason--heaven to such a mind
17153,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Had lent a heart compassionate and kind.
17154,_THE MAID’S STORY._,From him I learnt that one had call’d to know
17155,_THE MAID’S STORY._,What with my hand my parents could bestow;
17156,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And when he learn’d the truth, in high disdain           460"
17157,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He told my fate, and home return’d again."
17158,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Nay, be not grieved, my lovely girl; but few"
17159,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Wed the first love, however kind and true;"
17160,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Something there comes to break the strongest vow,"
17161,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Or mine had been my gentle Mattie now.
17162,_THE MAID’S STORY._,When the good lady died--but let me leave
17163,_THE MAID’S STORY._,All gloomy subjects--’tis not good to grieve.”
17164,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Thus the kind Scotchman soothed me; he sustain’d
17165,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A father’s part, and my submission gain’d,"
17166,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Then my affection; and he often told                     470
17167,_THE MAID’S STORY._,My sterner parent that her heart was cold.
17168,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He grew in honour--he obtain’d a name--
17169,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And now a favourite with the place became;
17170,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To me most gentle, he would condescend"
17171,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To read and reason, be the guide and friend;"
17172,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He taught me knowledge of the wholesome kind,"
17173,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And fill’d with many a useful truth my mind.
17174,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Life’s common burden daily lighter grew;
17175,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And even Frederick lessen’d in my view.
17176,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Cold and repulsive as he once appear’d,                  480"
17177,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He was by every generous act endear’d;
17178,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, above all, that he with ardour fill’d"
17179,_THE MAID’S STORY._,My soul for truth--a love by him instill’d;
17180,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Till my mamma grew jealous of a maid
17181,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To whom an husband such attention paid:
17182,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Not grossly jealous, but it gave her pain,"
17183,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And she observed, “He made her daughter vain;"
17184,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And what his help to one who must not look
17185,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To gain her bread by poring on a book?”
17186,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"This was distress; but this, and all beside,           490"
17187,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was lost in grief--my kinder parent died;
17188,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When praised and loved, when joy and health he gave,"
17189,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He sank lamented to an early grave;
17190,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then love and we the parent and the child,"
17191,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Lost in one grief, allied and reconciled."
17192,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yet soon a will, that left me half his worth,"
17193,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To the same spirit gave a second birth;
17194,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But ’twas a mother’s spleen; and she indeed
17195,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Was sick, and sad, and had of comfort need."
17196,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I watch’d the way her anxious spirit took,               500"
17197,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And often found her musing o’er a book;
17198,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She changed her dress, her church, her priest, her prayer,"
17199,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Join’d a new sect, and sought her comforts there."
17200,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Some strange, coarse people came, and were so free"
17201,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In their addresses, they offended me;"
17202,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But my mamma threw all her pride away--
17203,_THE MAID’S STORY._,More humble she as more assuming they.
17204,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“And what,” they said, as having power, “are now"
17205,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The inward conflicts? do you strive? and how?”
17206,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Themselves confessing thoughts so new and wild,          510"
17207,_THE MAID’S STORY._,I thought them like the visions of a child.
17208,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Could we,” they ask, “our best good deeds condemn? }"
17209,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And did we long to touch the garment’s hem?         }
17210,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And was it so with us? for so it was with them.”    }
17211,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A younger few assumed a softer part,"
17212,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And tried to shake the fortress of my heart;
17213,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To this my pliant mother lent her aid,"
17214,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And wish’d the winning of her erring maid.
17215,_THE MAID’S STORY._,I was constrain’d her female friends to hear;
17216,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But suffer’d not a bearded convert near;                 520
17217,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Though more than one attempted, with their whine."
17218,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And “Sister! sister! how that heart of thine?”
17219,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But this was freedom I for ever check’d:
17220,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Mine was a heart no brother could affect.
17221,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But, “would I hear the preacher, and receive"
17222,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The dropping dew of his discourse at eve?
17223,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The soft, sweet words?” I gave two precious hours"
17224,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To hear of gifts and graces, helps and powers;"
17225,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When a pale youth, who should dismiss the flock,"
17226,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Gave to my bosom an electric shock.                      530
17227,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"While in that act, he look’d upon my face"
17228,_THE MAID’S STORY._,As one in that all-equalizing place;
17229,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Nor, though he sought me, would he lay aside"
17230,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Their cold, dead freedom, or their dull, sad pride."
17231,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of his conversion he with triumph spoke,"
17232,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Before he orders from a bishop took;
17233,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then how his father’s anger he had braved,"
17234,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, safe himself, his erring neighbours saved."
17235,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Me he rejoiced a sister to behold
17236,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Among the members of his favourite fold;                 540
17237,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He had not sought me; the availing call
17238,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Demanded all his love, and had it all;"
17239,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But, now thus met, it must be heaven’s design.--"
17240,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Indeed! I thought; it never shall be mine!--
17241,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yes, we must wed. He was not rich: and I"
17242,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Had of the earthly good a mean supply;
17243,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But it sufficed. Of his conversion then
17244,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He told, and labours in converting men;"
17245,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For he was chosen all their bands among--
17246,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Another Daniel! honour’d, though so young.               550"
17247,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He call’d me sister; show’d me that he knew
17248,_THE MAID’S STORY._,What I possess’d; and told what it would do;
17249,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My looks, I judge, express’d my full disdain;                  }"
17250,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But it was given to the man in vain:                           }
17251,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"They preach till they are proud, and pride disturbs the brain. }"
17252,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Is this the youth once timid, mild, polite?"
17253,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"How odious now, and sick’ning to the sight!"
17254,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Proud that he sees, and yet so truly blind,"
17255,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With all this blight and mildew on the mind!
17256,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Amazed, the solemn creature heard me vow               560"
17257,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That I was not disposed to take him now.
17258,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Then, art thou changed, fair maiden? changed thy heart?”"
17259,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I answered, “No; but I perceive thou art.”"
17260,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Still was my mother sad, her nerves relax’d,"
17261,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And our small income for advice was tax’d;
17262,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When I, who long’d for change and freedom, cried,"
17263,_THE MAID’S STORY._,‘Let sea and Sidmouth’s balmy air be tried.’
17264,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And so they were, and every neighbouring scene,"
17265,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That make the bosom, like the clime, serene;"
17266,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet were her teachers loth to yield assent;              570
17267,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And not without the warning voice we went;
17268,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And there was secret counsel all unknown
17269,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To me--but I had counsel of my own.
17270,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And now there pass’d a portion of my time
17271,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In ease delicious, and in joy sublime--"
17272,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With friends endear’d by kindness--with delight
17273,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In all that could the feeling mind excite,"
17274,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Or please, excited; walks in every place"
17275,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Where we could pleasure find and beauty trace,"
17276,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Or views at night, where on the rocky steep              580"
17277,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Shines the full moon, or glitters on the deep."
17278,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yes, they were happy days; but they are fled!"
17279,_THE MAID’S STORY._,All now are parted--part are with the dead!
17280,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Still it is pleasure, though ’tis mix’d with pain,"
17281,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To think of joys that cannot live again--
17282,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Here cannot live; but they excite desire
17283,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of purer kind, and heavenly thoughts inspire!"
17284,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And now my mother, weaken’d in her mind,"
17285,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her will, subdued before, to me resign’d."
17286,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Wean’d from her late directors, by degrees               590"
17287,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She sank resign’d, and only sought for ease."
17288,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In a small town upon the coast we fix’d,"
17289,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Nor in amusement with associates mix’d.
17290,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My years--but other mode will I pursue,"
17291,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And count my time by what I sought to do.
17292,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And was that mind at ease? could I avow
17293,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That no once leading thoughts engaged me now?
17294,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was I convinced th’ enthusiastic man
17295,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Had ruin’d what the loving boy began?
17296,_THE MAID’S STORY._,I answer doubting--I could still detect                600
17297,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Feelings too soft--yet him I could reject:
17298,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Feelings that came when I had least employ--
17299,_THE MAID’S STORY._,When common pleasures I could least enjoy--
17300,_THE MAID’S STORY._,When I was pacing lonely in the rays
17301,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of a full moon, in lonely walks and ways--"
17302,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When I was sighing o’er a tale’s distress,"
17303,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And paid attention to my Bible less.
17304,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"These found, I sought my remedies for these;"
17305,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I suffer’d common things my mind to please,"
17306,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And common pleasures; seldom walk’d alone,               610"
17307,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Nor when the moon upon the waters shone;
17308,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But then my candles lit, my window closed,"
17309,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My needle took, and with my neighbours prosed;"
17310,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And in one year--nay, ere the end of one,"
17311,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My labour ended, and my love was done."
17312,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My heart at rest, I boldly look’d within,"
17313,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And dared to ask it of its secret sin;
17314,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Alas! with pride it answer’d, “Look around,"
17315,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And tell me where a better heart is found.”
17316,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And then I traced my virtues; O! how few,                620"
17317,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In fact, they were, and yet how vain I grew;"
17318,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Thought of my kindness, condescension, ease,"
17319,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My will, my wishes, nay, my power to please;"
17320,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I judged me prudent, rational, discreet,"
17321,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And void of folly, falsehood and deceit;"
17322,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I read, not lightly, as I some had known,"
17323,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But made an author’s meaning all my own;
17324,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In short, what lady could a poet choose"
17325,_THE MAID’S STORY._,As a superior subject for his muse?
17326,_THE MAID’S STORY._,So said my heart; and Conscience straight replied-- }
17327,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“I say the matter is not fairly tried:                }  631
17328,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I am offended, hurt, dissatisfied.                    }"
17329,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"First of the Christian graces, let me see"
17330,_THE MAID’S STORY._,What thy pretensions to humility?
17331,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Art thou prepared for trial? Wilt thou say
17332,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"‘I am this being,’ and for judgment pray?"
17333,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, with the gallant Frenchman, wilt thou cry,"
17334,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When to thy judge presented, ‘thus am I--"
17335,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Thus was I formed--these talents I possess’d--
17336,_THE MAID’S STORY._,So I employed them--and thou know’st the rest?’”         640
17337,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Thus Conscience; and she then a picture drew,"
17338,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And bade me think and tremble at the view.
17339,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"One I beheld--a wife, a mother--go"
17340,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To gloomy scenes of wickedness and wo;
17341,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She sought her way through all things vile and base,"
17342,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And made a prison a religious place;
17343,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Fighting her way--the way that angels fight
17344,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With powers of darkness--to let in the light.
17345,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Tell me, my heart, hast thou such victory won"
17346,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"As this, a sinner of thy sex, has done,                  650"
17347,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And calls herself a sinner? What art thou?
17348,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And where thy praise and exaltation now?
17349,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yet is she tender, delicate, and nice,"
17350,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And shrinks from all depravity and vice;
17351,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Shrinks from the ruffian gaze, the savage gloom,"
17352,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That reign where guilt and misery find an home--
17353,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Guilt chain’d, and misery purchased; and with them"
17354,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"All we abhor, abominate, condemn--"
17355,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The look of scorn, the scowl, th’ insulting leer"
17356,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of shame, all fix’d on her who ventures here.            660"
17357,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet all she braved! she kept her stedfast eye
17358,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"On the dear cause, and brush’d the baseness by."
17359,_THE MAID’S STORY._,So would a mother press her darling child
17360,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Close to her breast, with tainted rags defiled."
17361,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But thou hast talents truly! say, the ten:"
17362,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Come, let us look at their improvement then."
17363,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"What hast thou done to aid thy suffering kind,"
17364,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To help the sick, the deaf, the lame, the blind?"
17365,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Hast thou not spent thy intellectual force
17366,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"On books abstruse, in critical discourse?                670"
17367,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Wasting in useless energy thy days,"
17368,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And idly listening to their common praise,"
17369,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who can a kind of transient fame dispense,"
17370,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And say--“a woman of exceeding sense.”
17371,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Thus tried, and failing, the suggestions fled,"
17372,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And a corrected spirit reign’d instead.
17373,_THE MAID’S STORY._,My mother yet was living; but the flame
17374,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of life now flash’d, and fainter then became;"
17375,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I made it pleasant, and was pleased to see"
17376,_THE MAID’S STORY._,A parent looking as a child to me.                       680
17377,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And now our humble place grew wond’rous gay;       }
17378,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Came gallant persons in their red array:             }
17379,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"All strangers welcome there, extremely welcome they. }"
17380,_THE MAID’S STORY._,When in the church I saw inquiring eyes
17381,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Fix’d on my face with pleasure and surprise;
17382,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And soon a knocking at my door was heard;
17383,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And soon the lover of my youth appear’d--
17384,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Frederick, in all his glory, glad to meet,"
17385,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And say, “his happiness was now complete.”"
17386,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He told his flight from superstitious zeal;            690
17387,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But first what torments he was doom’d to feel:
17388,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The tender tears he saw from women fall--
17389,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The strong persuasions of the brethren all--
17390,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The threats of crazed enthusiasts, bound to keep"
17391,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The struggling mind, and awe the straying sheep--"
17392,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"From these, their love, their curses, and their creed,"
17393,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was I by reason and exertion freed.
17394,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then, like a man who often had been told"
17395,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And was convinced success attends the bold,"
17396,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"His former purpose he renew’d, and swore                 700"
17397,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He never loved me half so well before:
17398,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Before he felt a something to divide
17399,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The heart, that now had not a love beside."
17400,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In earlier times had I myself amused,"
17401,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And first my swain perplex’d, and then refused--"
17402,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Cure for conceit; but now in purpose grave,"
17403,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Strong and decisive the reply I gave.
17404,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Still he would come, and talk as idlers do,"
17405,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Both of his old associates and his new;
17406,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Those who their dreams and reveries receive              710
17407,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For facts, and those who would not facts believe."
17408,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He now conceived that truth was hidden, placed"
17409,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He knew not where, she never could be traced;"
17410,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But that in every place, the world around,"
17411,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Might some resemblance of the nymph be found.
17412,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yet wise men knew these shadows to be vain,"
17413,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Such as our true philosophers disdain--
17414,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“They laugh to see what vulgar minds pursue--             }
17415,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Truth, as a mistress, never in their view--               }"
17416,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But there the shadow flies, and that, they cry, is true.” }"
17417,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Thus, at the college and the meeting train’d,          721"
17418,_THE MAID’S STORY._,My lover seem’d his acmè to have gain’d;
17419,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With some compassion I essay’d a cure:
17420,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“If truth be hidden, why art thou so sure?”"
17421,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"This he mistook for tenderness, and cried,"
17422,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“If sure of thee, I care not what beside!”"
17423,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Compelled to silence, I, in pure disdain,"
17424,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Withdrew from one so insolent and vain;
17425,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He then retired; and, I was kindly told,"
17426,_THE MAID’S STORY._,In pure compassion grew estranged and cold.              730
17427,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My mother died; but, in my grief, drew near"
17428,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A bosom friend, who dried the useless tear;"
17429,_THE MAID’S STORY._,We lived together: we combined our shares
17430,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of the world’s good, and learn’d to brave its cares."
17431,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"We were the ladies of the place, and found"
17432,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Protection and respect the country round;
17433,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"We gave, and largely, for we wish’d to live"
17434,_THE MAID’S STORY._,In good repute--for this ’tis good to give;
17435,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Our annual present to the priest convey’d
17436,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was kindly taken--we in comfort pray’d.                  740
17437,_THE MAID’S STORY._,There none molested in the crimson pew
17438,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The worthy ladies, whom the vicar knew;"
17439,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And we began to think that life might be--
17440,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Not happy all, but innocently free."
17441,_THE MAID’S STORY._,My friend in early life was bound to one
17442,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of gentle kindred, but a younger son."
17443,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He fortune’s smile with perseverance woo’d,"
17444,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And wealth beneath the burning sun pursued.
17445,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"There, urged by love and youthful hope, he went,"
17446,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Loth; but ’twas all his fortune could present.           750
17447,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"From hence he wrote; and, with a lover’s fears,"
17448,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And gloomy fondness, talk’d of future years;"
17449,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To her devoted, his Priscilla found"
17450,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"His faithful heart still suffering with its wound,"
17451,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That would not heal. A second time she heard;
17452,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And then no more; nor lover since appear’d.
17453,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Year after year the country’s fleet arrived,"
17454,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Confirm’d her fear, and yet her love survived;"
17455,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"It still was living; yet her hope was dead,"
17456,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And youthful dreams, nay, youth itself, was fled;        760"
17457,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And he was lost: so urged her friends, so she"
17458,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"At length believed, and thus retired with me."
17459,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She would a dedicated vestal prove,"
17460,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And give her virgin vows to heaven and love;
17461,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She dwelt with fond regret on pleasures past,"
17462,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With ardent hope on those that ever last;
17463,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Pious and tender, every day she view’d"
17464,_THE MAID’S STORY._,With solemn joy our perfect solitude;
17465,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Her reading, that which most delighted her,"
17466,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That soothed the passions, yet would gently stir;        770"
17467,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The tender, softening, melancholy strain,              }"
17468,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"That caused not pleasure, but that vanquished pain,    }"
17469,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In tears she read, and wept, and long’d to read again. }"
17470,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But other worlds were her supreme delight,"
17471,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And there, it seem’d, she long’d to take her flight;"
17472,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Yet patient, pensive, arm’d by thoughts sublime,"
17473,_THE MAID’S STORY._,She watch’d the tardy steps of lingering time.
17474,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My friend, with face that most would handsome call,"
17475,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Possess’d the charm that wins the heart of all;
17476,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, thrice entreated by a lover’s prayer,               780"
17477,_THE MAID’S STORY._,She thrice refused him with determined air.
17478,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“No! had the world one monarch, and was he"
17479,_THE MAID’S STORY._,All that the heart could wish its lord to be--
17480,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Lovely and loving, generous, brave, and true--"
17481,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Vain were his hopes to waken hers anew!”
17482,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For she was wedded to ideal views,"
17483,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And fancy’s prospects, that she would not lose,"
17484,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Would not forego to be a mortal’s wife,"
17485,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And wed the poor realities of life.
17486,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"There was a day, ere yet the autumn closed,            790"
17487,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When, ere her wintry wars, the earth reposed;"
17488,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When from the yellow weed the feathery crown,"
17489,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Light as the curling smoke, fell slowly down;"
17490,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When the wing’d insect settled in our sight,"
17491,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And waited wind to recommence her flight;
17492,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When the wide river was a silver sheet,"
17493,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And on the ocean slept th’ unanchor’d fleet;
17494,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When from our garden, as we look’d above,"
17495,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"There was no cloud, and nothing seem’d to move;"
17496,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Then was my friend in ecstasies--she cried,              800"
17497,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“There is, I feel there is, a world beside!"
17498,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Martha, dear Martha! we shall hear not then"
17499,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Of hearts distress’d by good or evil men,"
17500,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But all will constant, tender, faithful be--"
17501,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"So had I been, and so had one with me;"
17502,_THE MAID’S STORY._,But in this world the fondest and the best
17503,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Are the most tried, most troubled, and distress’d:"
17504,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"This is the place for trial, here we prove,"
17505,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And there enjoy, the faithfulness of love."
17506,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Nay, were he here in all the pride of youth,          810"
17507,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With honour, valour, tenderness, and truth,"
17508,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Entirely mine, yet what could I secure,"
17509,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Or who one day of comfort could insure?
17510,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“No! all is closed on earth, and there is now"
17511,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Nothing to break th’ indissoluble vow;
17512,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But in that world will be th’ abiding bliss,"
17513,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That pays for every tear and sigh in this.”
17514,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Such her discourse, and more refined it grew,"
17515,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Till she had all her glorious dream in view;
17516,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And she would further in that dream proceed              820
17517,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Than I dare go, who doubtfully agreed."
17518,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Smiling I ask’d, again to draw the soul"
17519,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"From flight so high, and fancy to control,"
17520,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“If this be truth, the lover’s happier way"
17521,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Is distant still to keep the purposed day;
17522,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The real bliss would mar the fancied joy,"
17523,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And marriage all the dream of love destroy.”
17524,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She softly smiled, and, as we gravely talk’d,"
17525,_THE MAID’S STORY._,We saw a man who up the gravel walk’d--
17526,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Not quite erect, nor quite by age depress’d;             830"
17527,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A travell’d man, and as a merchant dress’d."
17528,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Large chain of gold upon his watch he wore,"
17529,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Small golden buckles on his feet he bore;
17530,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A head of gold his costly cane display’d,"
17531,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And all about him love of gold betray’d.
17532,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"This comely man moved onward, and a pair"
17533,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Of comely maidens met with serious air;
17534,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Till one exclaim’d, and wildly look’d around,"
17535,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“O heav’n, ’tis Paul!” and dropt upon the ground;"
17536,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But she recover’d soon, and you must guess               840"
17537,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"What then ensued, and how much happiness."
17538,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"They parted lovers, both distress’d to part;"
17539,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"They met as neighbours, heal’d, and whole of heart."
17540,_THE MAID’S STORY._,She in his absence look’d to heaven for bliss;
17541,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He was contented with a world like this:
17542,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And she prepared in some new state to meet
17543,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The man now seeking for some snug retreat.
17544,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He kindly told her he was firm and true,"
17545,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Nor doubted her, and bade her then adieu!"
17546,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“What shall I do?” the sighing maid began,             850"
17547,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“How lost the lover! O, how gross the man!”"
17548,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For the plain dealer had his wish declared,"
17549,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Nor she, devoted victim! could be spared."
17550,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He spoke as one decided; she as one
17551,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who fear’d the love, and would the lover shun."
17552,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“O Martha, sister of my soul! how dies"
17553,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Each lovely view! for can I truth disguise,"
17554,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That this is he? No! nothing shall persuade:
17555,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"This is a man the naughty world has made,"
17556,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"An eating, drinking, buying, bargaining man--           860"
17557,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And can I love him? No! I never can.
17558,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"What once he was, what fancy gave beside,"
17559,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Full well I know, my love was then my pride;"
17560,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"What time has done, what trade and travel wrought,"
17561,_THE MAID’S STORY._,You see! and yet your sorrowing friend is sought;
17562,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But can I take him?”--“Take him not,” I cried,"
17563,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“If so averse--but why so soon decide?”
17564,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Meantime a daily guest the man appear’d,"
17565,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Set all his sail, and for his purpose steer’d;"
17566,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Loud and familiar, loving, fierce and free,              870"
17567,_THE MAID’S STORY._,He overpower’d her soft timidity:
17568,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who, weak and vain, and grateful to behold"
17569,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The man was hers, and hers would be the gold--"
17570,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Thus sundry motives, more than I can name,"
17571,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Leagued on his part, and she a wife became."
17572,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A home was offer’d, but I knew too well"
17573,_THE MAID’S STORY._,What comfort was with married friends to dwell;
17574,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I was resign’d, and had I felt distress,"
17575,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Again a lover offer’d some redress.
17576,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Behold, a hero of the buskin hears                       880"
17577,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My loss, and with consoling love appears."
17578,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Frederick was now a hero on the stage,"
17579,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In all its glories, rhapsody, and rage;"
17580,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Again himself he offer’d, offer’d all"
17581,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That his an hero of the kind can call:
17582,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He for my sake would hope of fame resign,"
17583,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And leave the applause of all the world for mine.
17584,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Hard fate was Frederick’s never to succeed,"
17585,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet ever try--but so it was decreed.
17586,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"His mind was weakened; he would laugh and weep,          890"
17587,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And swore profusely I had murder’d sleep,"
17588,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Had quite unmann’d him, cleft his heart in twain,"
17589,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And he should never be himself again.
17590,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He _was_ himself: weak, nervous, kind, and poor,"
17591,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Ill dress’d and idle, he besieged my door;"
17592,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Borrow’d,--or, worse; made verses on my charms,"
17593,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And did his best to fill me with alarms.
17594,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I had some pity, and I sought the price"
17595,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Of my repose--my hero was not nice:
17596,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"There was a loan, and promise I should be        }      900"
17597,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"From all the efforts of his fondness free,       }"
17598,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"From hunger’s future claims, or those of vanity. }"
17599,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Yet,” said he, bowing, “do to study take!"
17600,_THE MAID’S STORY._,O! what a Desdemona wouldst thou make!”
17601,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Thus was my lover lost; yet even now
17602,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He claims one thought, and this we will allow."
17603,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"His father lived to an extreme old age,"
17604,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But never kind!--his son had left the stage,"
17605,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And gain’d some office, but an humble place,"
17606,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And that he lost! Want sharpen’d his disgrace,           910"
17607,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Urged him to seek his father--but too late:
17608,_THE MAID’S STORY._,His jealous brothers watch’d and barr’d the gate.
17609,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The old man died; but there is one who pays
17610,_THE MAID’S STORY._,A moderate pension for his latter days;
17611,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Who, though assured inquiries will offend,"
17612,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Is ever asking for this unknown friend:
17613,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Some partial lady, whom he hopes to find"
17614,_THE MAID’S STORY._,As to his wants so to his wishes kind.
17615,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Be still,” a cool adviser sometimes writes--"
17616,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Nay, but,” says he, “the gentle maid invites--         920"
17617,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Do, let me know the young! the soft! the fair!”"
17618,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Old man,” ’tis answer’d, “take thyself to prayer!"
17619,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Be clean, be sober, to thy priest apply,"
17620,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And--dead to all around thee--learn to die!”
17621,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Now had I rest from life’s strong hopes and fears,"
17622,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And no disturbance mark’d the flying years;
17623,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"So on in quiet might those years have past,"
17624,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But for a light adventure, and a last."
17625,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"A handsome boy, from school-day bondage free,"
17626,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Came with mamma to gaze upon the sea;                    930
17627,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With soft blue eye he look’d upon the waves,"
17628,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And talk’d of treacherous rocks, and seamen’s graves."
17629,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"There was much sweetness in his boyish smile,"
17630,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And signs of feelings frank, that knew not guile."
17631,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The partial mother, of her darling proud,"
17632,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Besought my friendship, and her own avow’d;"
17633,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She praised her Rupert’s person, spirit, ease,"
17634,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"How fond of study, yet how form’d to please."
17635,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In our discourse he often bore a part,"
17636,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And talk’d, heaven bless him, of his feeling heart;      940"
17637,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He spoke of pleasures souls like his enjoy,"
17638,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And hated Lovelace like a virtuous boy;
17639,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He felt for Clementina’s holy strife,"
17640,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And was Sir Charles as large and true as life;
17641,_THE MAID’S STORY._,For Virtue’s heroines was his soul distress’d;
17642,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"True love and guileless honour fill’d his breast,"
17643,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When, as the subjects drew the frequent sigh,        }"
17644,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The tear stood trembling in his large blue eye,      }"
17645,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And softly he exclaim’d, “Sweet, sweetest sympathy!” }"
17646,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When thus I heard the handsome stripling speak,        950"
17647,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"I smiled assent, and thought to pat his cheek;"
17648,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But when I saw the feelings blushing there,"
17649,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Signs of emotions strong, they said--forbear!"
17650,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The youth would speak of his intent to live
17651,_THE MAID’S STORY._,On that estate which heaven was pleased to give--
17652,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"There with the partner of his joys to dwell,"
17653,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And nurse the virtues that he loved so well;
17654,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The humble good of happy swains to share,"
17655,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And from the cottage drive distress and care;
17656,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To the dear infants make some pleasures known,           960"
17657,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And teach, he gravely said, the virtues to his own."
17658,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He loved to read in verse, and verse-like prose,"
17659,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The softest tales of love-inflicted woes;
17660,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When, looking fondly, he would smile and cry,"
17661,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“Is there not bliss in sensibility?”
17662,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"We walk’d together, and it seem’d not harm"
17663,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"In linking thought with thought, and arm with arm;"
17664,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Till the dear boy would talk too much of bliss,"
17665,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And indistinctly murmur--“such as this.”
17666,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When no maternal wish her heart beguiled,              970"
17667,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The lady call’d her son “her darling child;”
17668,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When with some nearer view her speech began,"
17669,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"She changed her phrase, and said, “the good young man!”"
17670,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And lost, when hinting of some future bride,"
17671,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The woman’s prudence in the mother’s pride.
17672,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Still decent fear and conscious folly strove

17709,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Unhappy then, beheld not all the truth."
17710,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“O! what is this?” exclaim’d the dubious boy;
17711,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“Words that confuse the being they destroy?
17712,_THE MAID’S STORY._,So have I read the gods to madness drive
17713,_THE MAID’S STORY._,The man condemn’d with adverse fate to strive.
17714,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"O! make thy victim, though by misery, sure,"
17715,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And let me know the pangs I must endure;

17718,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Pretty, my Rupert; and it proves the use"

17720,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But come, your arm--no trembling, but attend"
17721,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To sober truth, and a maternal friend."
17722,_THE MAID’S STORY._,“You ask for pity?”--“O! indeed I do.”
17723,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Well then, you have it, and assistance too:"
17724,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Suppose us married!”--“O! the heavenly thought!”
17725,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Nay--nay, my friend, be you by wisdom taught;"
17726,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"For wisdom tells you, love would soon subside,          1030"
17727,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Fall, and make room for penitence and pride;"

17730,_THE MAID’S STORY._,How must it then your bosom’s peace destroy
17731,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To hear it said, ‘The mother and her boy!’"
17732,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And then to show the sneering world it lies,"
17733,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"You would assume the man, and tyrannize;"
17734,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Ev’n Time, Care’s general soother, would augment"
17735,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Your self-reproaching, growing discontent."
17736,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Add twenty years to my precarious life,              1040"
17737,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And lo! your aged, feeble, wailing wife;"
17738,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Displeased, displeasing, discontented, blamed;"
17739,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Both, and with cause, ashaming and ashamed."
17740,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"When I shall bend beneath a press of time,"
17741,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Thou wilt be all erect in manhood’s prime;

17745,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And, though in anguish all my days are past,"
17746,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Yet far beyond thy wishes they may last--              1050
17747,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"May last till thou, thy better prospects fled,"
17748,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Shall have no comfort when thy wife is dead.

17750,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"[Wilt] feel thy spirit fled, thy bosom cold;"
17751,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"No strong or eager wish to make the will,"
17752,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Life will appear to stagnate and be still,"
17753,_THE MAID’S STORY._,As now with me it slumbers: O! rejoice
17754,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That I attend not to that pleading voice;
17755,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"So will new hopes this troubled dream succeed,"
17756,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And one will gladly hear my Rupert plead.”              1060

17758,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Was I unmoved?--Inexorable I,"

17760,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"With looks of sadness first, and then despair;"
17761,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Thrice doom’d to bear refusal, not exempt,"
17762,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"At the last effort, from a slight contempt."
17763,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Did his distress, his pains, your joy excite?--”"
17764,_THE MAID’S STORY._,No; but I fear’d his perseverance might.
17765,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Was there no danger in the moon’s soft rays,"
17766,_THE MAID’S STORY._,To hear the handsome stripling’s earnest praise?        1070
17767,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Was there no fear that while my words reproved
17768,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"The eager youth, I might myself be moved?"
17769,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Not for his sake alone I cried “persist
17770,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"No more,” and with a frown the cause dismiss’d."
17771,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Seek you th’ event?--I scarcely need reply:
17772,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Love, unreturn’d, will languish, pine, and die."
17773,_THE MAID’S STORY._,We lived awhile in friendship; and with joy
17774,_THE MAID’S STORY._,I saw depart in peace the amorous boy.
17775,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"We met some ten years after, and he then"
17776,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Was married, and as cool as married men;                1080"
17777,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He talk’d of war and taxes, trade and farms,"
17778,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"And thought no more of me, or of my charms."
17779,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"We spoke; and when, alluding to the past,"
17780,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Something of meaning in my look I cast,"
17781,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"He, who could never thought or wish disguise,"
17782,_THE MAID’S STORY._,Look’d in my face with trouble and surprise.
17783,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"To kill reserve, I seized his arm, and cried,"
17784,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"“Know me, my lord!” when laughing, he replied,"
17785,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Wonder’d again, and look’d upon my face,"
17786,_THE MAID’S STORY._,And seem’d unwilling marks of time to trace;            1090
17787,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"But soon I brought him fairly to confess,"
17788,_THE MAID’S STORY._,That boys in love judge ill of happiness.
17789,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"Love had his day--to graver subjects led,"
17790,_THE MAID’S STORY._,"My will is govern’d, and my mind is fed;"
