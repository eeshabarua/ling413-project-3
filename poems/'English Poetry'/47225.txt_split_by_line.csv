116,I.,I.
117,I.,
118,I.,"Melpomene among her livid people,"
119,I.,"Ere stroke of lyre, upon Thaleia looks,"
120,I.,Warned by old contests that one museful ripple
121,I.,"Along those lips of rose with tendril hooks,"
122,I.,"Forebodes disturbance in the springs of pathos,"
123,I.,"Perchance may change of masks midway demand,"
124,I.,"Albeit the man rise mountainous as Athos,"
125,I.,The woman wild as Cape Leucadia stand.
126,I.,
127,I.,
128,II.,II.
129,II.,
130,II.,For this the Comic Muse exacts of creatures
131,II.,Appealing to the fount of tears: that they
132,II.,"Strive never to outleap our human features,"
133,II.,"And do Right Reason's ordinance obey,"
134,II.,In peril of the hum to laughter nighest.
135,II.,But prove they under stress of action's fire
136,II.,"Nobleness, to that test of Reason highest,"
137,II.,She bows: she waves them for the loftier lyre.

146,I.,
147,I.,I.
148,I.,
149,I.,In middle age an evil thing
150,I.,Befel Archduchess Anne:
151,I.,She looked outside her wedding-ring
152,I.,Upon a princely man.
153,I.,
154,I.,
155,II.,II.
156,II.,
157,II.,Count Louis was for horse and arms;
158,II.,"And if its beacon waved,"
159,II.,For love; but ladies had not charms
160,II.,To match a danger braved.
161,II.,
162,II.,
163,III.,III.
164,III.,
165,III.,On battlefields he was the bow
166,III.,Bestrung to fly the shaft:
167,III.,In idle hours his heart would flow
168,III.,As winds on currents waft.
169,III.,
170,III.,
171,IV.,IV.
172,IV.,
173,IV.,His blood was of those warrior tribes
174,IV.,"That streamed from morning's fire,"
175,IV.,Whom now with traps and now with bribes
176,IV.,The wily Council wire.
177,IV.,
178,IV.,
179,V.,V.
180,V.,
181,V.,"Archduchess Anne the Council ruled,"
182,V.,Count Louis his great dame;
183,V.,And woe to both when one had cooled!
184,V.,Little was she to blame.
185,V.,
186,V.,
187,VI.,VI.
188,VI.,
189,VI.,"Among her chiefs who spun their plots,"
190,VI.,Old Kraken stood the sword:
191,VI.,As sharp his wits for cutting knots
192,VI.,Of babble he abhorred.
193,VI.,
194,VI.,
195,VII.,VII.
196,VII.,
197,VII.,"He reverenced her name and line,"
198,VII.,Nor other merit had
199,VII.,"Save soldierwise to wait her sign,"
200,VII.,And do the deed she bade.
201,VII.,
202,VII.,
203,VIII.,VIII.
204,VIII.,
205,VIII.,He saw her hand jump at her side
206,VIII.,Ere royally she smiled
207,VIII.,On Louis and his fair young bride
208,VIII.,Where courtly ranks defiled.
209,VIII.,
210,VIII.,
211,IX.,IX.
212,IX.,
213,IX.,That was a moment when a shock
214,IX.,"Through the procession ran,"
215,IX.,"And thrilled the plumes, and stayed the clock,"
216,IX.,Yet smiled Archduchess Anne.
217,IX.,
218,IX.,
219,X.,X.
220,X.,
221,X.,"No touch gave she to hound in leash,"
222,X.,No wink to sword in sheath:

224,X.,"Above it, or beneath."
225,X.,
226,X.,
227,XI.,XI.
228,XI.,
229,XI.,"Old Kraken spied with kennelled snarl,"
230,XI.,His Lady deemed disgraced.
231,XI.,"He footed as on burning marl,"
232,XI.,When out of Hall he paced.
233,XI.,
234,XI.,
235,XII.,XII.
236,XII.,
237,XII.,"'Twas seen he hammered striding legs,"
238,XII.,"And stopped, and strode again."
239,XII.,"Now Vengeance has a brood of eggs,"
240,XII.,But Patience must be hen.
241,XII.,
242,XII.,
243,XIII.,XIII.
244,XIII.,
245,XIII.,"Too slow are they for wrath to hatch,"
246,XIII.,Too hot for time to rear.
247,XIII.,Old Kraken kept unwinking watch;
248,XIII.,He marked his day appear.
249,XIII.,
250,XIII.,
251,XIV.,XIV.
252,XIV.,
253,XIV.,"He neighed a laugh, though moods were rough"
254,XIV.,With standards in revolt:

256,XIV.,His smacking lips for salt.
257,XIV.,
258,XIV.,
259,XV.,XV.
260,XV.,
261,XV.,Count Louis' wavy cock's plumes led
262,XV.,"His troops of black-haired manes,"
263,XV.,A rebel; and old Kraken sped
264,XV.,To front him on the plains.
265,XV.,
266,XV.,
267,XVI.,XVI.
268,XVI.,
269,XVI.,Then camp opposed to camp did they
270,XVI.,Fret earth with panther claws
271,XVI.,"For signal of a bloody day,"
272,XVI.,Each reading from the Laws.
273,XVI.,
274,XVI.,
275,XVII.,XVII.
276,XVII.,
277,XVII.,"'Forfend it, heaven!' Count Louis cried,"
278,XVII.,'And let the righteous plead:
279,XVII.,"My country is a willing bride,"
280,XVII.,Was never slave decreed.
281,XVII.,
282,XVII.,
283,XVIII.,XVIII.
284,XVIII.,
285,XVIII.,'Not we for thirst of blood appeal
286,XVIII.,To sword and slaughter cursed;
287,XVIII.,"We have God's blessing on our steel,"
288,XVIII.,Do we our pleading first.'
289,XVIII.,
290,XVIII.,
291,XIX.,XIX.
292,XIX.,
293,XIX.,"Count Louis, soul of chivalry,"
294,XIX.,Put trust in plighted word;

296,XIX.,To bar the strife he spurred.
297,XIX.,
298,XIX.,
299,XX.,XX.
300,XX.,
301,XX.,"Across his breast a crimson spot,"
302,XX.,"That in a quiver glowed,"
303,XX.,"The ruddy crested camp-fires shot,"
304,XX.,As he to darkness rode.
305,XX.,
306,XX.,
307,XXI.,XXI.
308,XXI.,
309,XXI.,"He rode while omens called, beware"
310,XXI.,Old Kraken's pledge of faith!
311,XXI.,"A smile and waving hand in air,"
312,XXI.,And outward flew the wraith.
313,XXI.,
314,XXI.,
315,XXII.,XXII.
316,XXII.,
317,XXII.,"Before pale morn had mixed with gold,"
318,XXII.,"His army roared, and chilled,"

321,XXII.,
322,XXII.,
323,XXIII.,XXIII.
324,XXIII.,
325,XXIII.,"Away and to his young wife speed,"
326,XXIII.,And say that Honour's dead!

328,XXIII.,To bow a widow's head.
329,XXIII.,
330,XXIII.,
331,XXIV.,XXIV.
332,XXIV.,
333,XXIV.,Old Kraken roped his white moustache
334,XXIV.,Right left for savage glee:

336,XXIV.,Were kind for such as he!
337,XXIV.,
338,XXIV.,
339,XXV.,XXV.
340,XXV.,
341,XXV.,Old Kraken's look hard Winter wears
342,XXV.,When sweeps the wild snow-blast:

356,I.,
357,II.,II.
358,II.,
359,II.,"One hand enclosed a paper scroll,"

361,II.,So may we see the woman's soul
362,II.,In her dire tempter's grasp.
363,II.,
364,II.,
365,III.,III.
366,III.,
367,III.,Along that scroll Count Louis' doom
368,III.,Throbbed till the letters flamed.
369,III.,"She saw him in his scornful bloom,"
370,III.,She saw him chained and shamed.
371,III.,
372,III.,
373,IV.,IV.
374,IV.,
375,IV.,Around that scroll Count Louis' fate
376,IV.,"Was acted to her stare,"

380,IV.,
381,V.,V.

387,V.,
388,V.,
389,VI.,VI.

396,VI.,
397,VII.,VII.
398,VII.,
399,VII.,Yet who had sprung to life's full force

411,VIII.,
412,VIII.,
413,IX.,IX.
414,IX.,
415,IX.,In floods her tender memories poured;

468,XV.,
469,XVI.,XVI.
470,XVI.,
471,XVI.,With Louis' chance it went not well

2170,XVII.,Loud they swore the king had sworn
2171,XVII.,"Vengeance on the Roman cheat,"
2172,XVII.,"Ere he passed as, grave and still,"
2173,XVII.,Danube through the shouting hill:
2174,XVII.,Sworn it by his naked life!
2175,XVII.,"Eagle, snakes these women are:"

2225,XIX.,They are poison: they have thirst
2226,XIX.,"First for love, and next for rule."
2227,XIX.,"Jealous of the army, she?"
2228,XIX.,"Ho, the little wanton fool!"
2229,XIX.,We were his before she squealed
2230,XIX.,"Blind for mother's milk, and heeled"
2231,XIX.,Kicking on her mother's knee.
2232,XIX.,His in life and death are we:
2233,XIX.,She but one flower of a field.

2246,XX.,Western day knocked at his door.
2247,XX.,"Attila, my Attila!"
2248,XX.,Sudden in the army's eyes
2249,XX.,Rolled a blast of lights and cries:
2250,XX.,Flashing through them: Dead are ye!
2251,XX.,"Dead, ye Huns, and torn piecemeal!"
2252,XX.,See the ordered army reel
2253,XX.,"Stricken through the ribs: and see,"

2256,XX.,Crouch and dart they know not where.
2257,XX.,"Attila, my Attila!"
2258,XX.,"Faces covered, faces bare,"
2259,XX.,Light the palace-front like jets
2260,XX.,Of a dreadful fire within.
2261,XX.,Beating hands and driving hair
2262,XX.,Start on roof and parapets.
2263,XX.,Dust rolls up; the slaughter din.
2264,XX.,--Death to them who call him dead!
2265,XX.,Death to them who doubt the tale!
2266,XX.,"Choking in his dusty veil,"
2267,XX.,Sank the sun on his death-bed.

2280,XXI.,"Attila, my Attila!"
2281,XXI.,One long shaft of sunset red
2282,XXI.,Laid a finger on the bed.
2283,XXI.,"Horror, with the snaky locks,"
2284,XXI.,"Shocked the surge to stiffened heaps,"
2285,XXI.,Hoary as the glacier's head
2286,XXI.,Faced to the moon. Insane they look.
2287,XXI.,God it is in heaven who weeps
2288,XXI.,Fallen from his hand the Scourge he shook.

2301,XXII.,Him an oaklog stripped of bark:
2302,XXII.,"Him, their lord of day and night,"
2303,XXII.,"White, and lifting up his blood"
2304,XXII.,"Dumb for vengeance. Name us that,"
2305,XXII.,"Huddled in the corner dark,"

2322,XXIII.,Fell three-fingered on the bed.
2323,XXIII.,In the torch the beard-hair scant
2324,XXIII.,With the great breast seemed to pant:

2326,XXIII.,"Wavered, as the lake-flower swims:"

2343,XXV.,Then had Vengeance of her feast
2344,XXV.,Scent in their quick pang to smite
2345,XXV.,"Which they knew not, but huge pain"
2346,XXV.,Urged them for some victim slain
2347,XXV.,"Swift, and blotted from the sight."
2348,XXV.,"Each at each, a crouching beast,"
2349,XXV.,"Glared, and quivered for the word."
2350,XXV.,"Each at each, and all on that,"
2351,XXV.,"Humped and grinning like a cat,"
2352,XXV.,Head-bound with its bridal-wreath.
2353,XXV.,Then the bitter chamber heard
2354,XXV.,Vengeance in a cauldron seethe.
2355,XXV.,Hurried counsel rage and craft
2356,XXV.,"Yelped to hungry men, whose teeth"
2357,XXV.,"Hard the grey lip-ringlet gnawed,"
2358,XXV.,Gleaming till their fury laughed.
2359,XXV.,"With the steel-hilt in the clutch,"
2360,XXV.,Eyes were shot on her that froze
2361,XXV.,In their blood-thirst overawed;
2362,XXV.,"Burned to rend, yet feared to touch."
2363,XXV.,"She that was his nuptial rose,"
2364,XXV.,She was of his heart's blood clad:
2365,XXV.,Oh! the last of him she had!--
2366,XXV.,Could a little fist as big
2367,XXV.,"As the southern summer fig,"
2368,XXV.,Push a dagger's point to pierce
2369,XXV.,Ribs like those? Who else! They glared
2370,XXV.,Each at each. Suspicion fierce
2371,XXV.,Many a black remembrance bared.
2372,XXV.,"Attila, my Attila!"
2373,XXV.,"Death, who dares deny her guilt!"
2374,XXV.,"Death, who says his blood she spilt!"
2375,XXV.,"Traitor he, who stands between!"
2376,XXV.,"Swift to hell, who harms the Queen!"
2377,XXV.,"She, the wild contention's cause,"
2378,XXV.,Combed her hair with quiet paws.

2388,XXVI.,"Torch and steel and snorting steed,"
2389,XXVI.,"Hunted by the cry of blood,"
2390,XXVI.,"Cursed with blindness, mad for day."
2391,XXVI.,"Where the torches ran a flood,"
2392,XXVI.,Tales of him and of the deed
2393,XXVI.,Showered like a torrent spray.
2394,XXVI.,Fear of silence made them strive
2395,XXVI.,Loud in warrior-hymns that grew
2396,XXVI.,Hoarse for slaughter yet unwreaked.
2397,XXVI.,"Ghostly Night across the hive,"
2398,XXVI.,With a crimson finger drew
2399,XXVI.,Letters on her breast and shrieked.
2400,XXVI.,Night was on them like the mould
2401,XXVI.,On the buried half alive.
2402,XXVI.,"Night, their bloody Queen, her fold"
2403,XXVI.,Wound on them and struck them through.

2427,XXIX.,XXIX.
2428,XXIX.,
2429,XXIX.,Kingless was the army left:
2430,XXIX.,Of its head the race bereft.
2431,XXIX.,Every fury of the pit
2432,XXIX.,Tortured and dismembered it.
2433,XXIX.,"Lo, upon a silent hour,"
2434,XXIX.,"When the pitch of frost subsides,"
2435,XXIX.,Danube with a shout of power
2436,XXIX.,Loosens his imprisoned tides:
2437,XXIX.,Wide around the frighted plains
2438,XXIX.,"Shake to hear his riven chains,"
2439,XXIX.,"Dreadfuller than heaven in wrath,"
2440,XXIX.,As he makes himself a path:
2441,XXIX.,"High leap the ice-cracks, towering pile"
2442,XXIX.,"Floes to bergs, and giant peers"
2443,XXIX.,Wrestle on a drifted isle;
2444,XXIX.,Island on ice-island rears;
2445,XXIX.,Dissolution battles fast:
2446,XXIX.,"Big the senseless Titans loom,"
2447,XXIX.,Through a mist of common doom
2448,XXIX.,Striving which shall die the last:
2449,XXIX.,Till a gentle-breathing morn
2450,XXIX.,Frees the stream from bank to bank.
2451,XXIX.,So the Empire built of scorn
2452,XXIX.,"Agonized, dissolved and sank."
2453,XXIX.,Of the Queen no more was told
2454,XXIX.,Than of leaf on Danube rolled.

2918,VII.,Needed but hear her shouting to obey.
2919,VII.,Was she not formed to conquer? The bright plumes
2920,VII.,Of crested vanity shed graceful nods:
2921,VII.,"Transcendent in her foundries, Arts and looms,"
2922,VII.,Had France to fear the vengeance of the Gods?
2923,VII.,Her faith was on her battle-roll of names
2924,VII.,Sheathed in the records of old war; with dance
2925,VII.,"And song she thrilled her warriors and her dames,"
2926,VII.,Embracing her Dishonourer: gave him France
2927,VII.,"From head to foot, France present and to come,"
2928,VII.,So she might hear the trumpet and the drum--

2930,VII.,On yon stout marching Schoolmen of the North.
2931,VII.,
2932,VII.,"Inveterate of brain, well knows she why"

3626,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,Till a thunder off the tense chords thro' his ears dinned horrible.
3627,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,Panic seized him: fled his vision of inviolability;
3628,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,Fled the dream that he of mortals rode mischances predominant;
3629,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"And he cried, 'Had I petitioned for a cup of chill aconite,"
3630,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'My descent to awful Hades had been soft, for now must I go"
3631,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,'With the curse by father Zeus cast on ambition immoderate.
3632,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'Oh, my sisters! Thou, my Goddess, in whose love I was enviable,"
3633,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'From whose arms I rushed befrenzied, what a wreck will this body be,"
3634,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,'That admired of thee stood rose-warm in the courts where thy mysteries
3635,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'Celebration had from me, me the most splendidly privileged!"
3636,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,'Never more shall I thy temple fill with incenses bewildering;
3637,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'Not again hear thy half-murmurs--I am lost!--never, never more."
3638,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'I am wrecked on seas of air, hurled to my death in a vessel of flame!"
3639,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'Hither, sisters! Father, save me! Hither, succour me, Cypria!'"
3640,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,
3641,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,Now a wail of men to Zeus rang: from Olympus the Thunderer
3642,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Saw the rage of the havoc wide-mouthed, the bright car superimpending"
3643,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Over Asia, Africa, low down; ruin flaming over the vales;"
3644,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,Light disastrous rising savage out of smoke inveterately;
3645,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Beast-black, the conflagration like a menacing shadow move"
3646,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"With voracious roaring southward, where aslant, insufferable,"
3647,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,The bright steeds careered their parched way down an arc of the firmament.
3648,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"For the day grew like to thick night, and the orb was its beacon-fire,"
3649,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,And from hill to hill of darkness burst the day's apparition forth.
3650,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Lo, a wrestler, not a God, stood in the chariot ever lowering:"
3651,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Lo, the shape of one who raced there to outstrip the legitimate hours:"
3652,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Lo, the ravish'd beams of Phoebus dragg'd in shame at the chariot-wheels:"
3653,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,Light of days of happy pipings by the mead-singing rivulets!
3654,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Lo, lo, increasing lustre, torrid breath to the nostrils; lo,"
3655,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Torrid brilliancies thro' the vapours lighten swifter, penetrate them,"
3656,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Fasten merciless, ruminant, hueless, on earth's frame crackling busily."
3657,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"He aloft, the frenzied driver, in the glow of the universe,"
3658,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Like the paling of the dawn-star withers visibly, he aloft:"
3659,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Bitter fury in his aspect, bitter death in the heart of him."
3660,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Crouch the herds, contract the reptiles, crouch the lions under their paws."
3661,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,White as metal in the furnace are the faces of humankind:
3662,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Inarticulate creatures of earth, dumb all await the ultimate shock."
3663,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,
3664,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"To the bolt he launched, 'Strike dead, thou,' uttered Zeus, very terrible;"
3665,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"'Perish folly, else 'tis man's fate;' and the bolt flew unerringly."
3666,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,Then the kindler stooped; from the torch-car down the measureless altitudes
3667,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Leaned his rayless head, relinquished rein and footing, raised not a cry."
3668,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Like the flower on the river's surface when expanding it vanishes,"
3669,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Gave his limbs to right and left, quenched: and so fell he precipitate,"
3670,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Seen of men as a glad rain-fall, sending coolness yet ere it comes:"
3671,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"So he showered above them, shadowed o'er the blue archipelagoes,"
3672,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,O'er the silken-shining pastures of the continents and the isles;
3673,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,So descending brought revival to the greenery of our earth.
3674,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,
3675,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Lither, noisy in the breezes now his sisters shivering weep,"
3676,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"By the river flowing smooth out to the vexed sea of Adria,"
3677,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Where he fell, and where they suffered sudden change to the tremulous"
3678,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Ever-wailful trees bemoaning him, a bruised purple cyclamen."

3709,PHAETHON.,The wonderful +Atys+ of Catullus is the one classic example. A few
3710,PHAETHON.,lines have been gathered elsewhere. The Laureate's +Boadicea+ rides
3711,PHAETHON.,over many difficulties and is a noble poem. Catullus makes general use
3712,PHAETHON.,of the variant second of the above metrical forms:
