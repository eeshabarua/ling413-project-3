280,I,"Lift up your hearts in Gumber, laugh the Weald"
281,I,And you most ancient Valley of Arun sing.
282,I,"Here am I homeward from my wandering,"
283,I,Here am I homeward and my heart is healed.
284,I,"If I was thirsty, I have heard a spring."
285,I,"If I was dusty, I have found a field."
286,I,
287,I,
288,II,II
289,II,
290,II,I was like one that keeps the deck by night
291,II,Bearing the tiller up against his breast;
292,II,I was like one whose soul is centred quite
293,II,"In holding course although so hardly prest,"
294,II,"And veers with veering shock now left now right,"
295,II,And strains his foothold still and still makes play
296,II,Of bending beams until the sacred light
297,II,Shows him high lands and heralds up the day.
298,II,
299,II,But now such busy work of battle past
300,II,I am like one whose barque at bar at last
301,II,Comes hardly heeling down the adventurous breeze;
302,II,"And entering calmer seas,"
303,II,I am like one that brings his merchandise
304,II,To Californian skies.
305,II,
306,II,
307,III,III
308,III,
309,III,Rise up and do begin the day’s adorning;
310,III,The Summer dark is but the dawn of day.
311,III,The last of sunset fades into the morning;
312,III,The morning calls you from the dark away.
313,III,"The holy mist, the white mist of the morning"
314,III,Was wreathing upward on my lonely way.
315,III,The way was waiting for your own adorning
316,III,That should complete the broad adornéd day.
317,III,
318,III,Rise up and do begin the day’s adorning;
319,III,The little eastern clouds are dapple grey:
320,III,There will be wind among the leaves to-day;
321,III,It is the very promise of the morning.
322,III,_Lux Tua Via Mea_: your light’s my way--
323,III,Then do rise up and make it perfect day.
324,III,
325,III,
326,IV,IV
327,IV,
328,IV,The Winter Moon has such a quiet car
329,IV,That all the winter nights are dumb with rest.
330,IV,She drives the gradual dark with drooping crest
331,IV,And dreams go wandering from her drowsy star
332,IV,Because the nights are silent do not wake
333,IV,"But there shall tremble through the general earth,"
334,IV,"And over you, a quickening and a birth."
335,IV,The Sun is near the hill-tops for your sake.
336,IV,
337,IV,The latest born of all the days shall creep
338,IV,To kiss the tender eyelids of the year;
339,IV,"And you shall wake, grown young with perfect sleep,"
340,IV,And smile at the new world and make it dear
341,IV,With living murmurs more than dreams are deep;
342,IV,"Silence is dead, my dawn, the morning’s here."
343,IV,
344,IV,
345,V,V
346,V,
347,V,Whatever moisture nourishes the Rose
348,V,The Rose of the World in laughter’s garden-bed
349,V,Where Souls of men on faith secure are fed
350,V,And spirits immortal keep their pleasure-close.
351,V,"Whatever moisture nourishes the Rose,"
352,V,"The burning Rose of the world, for me the same"
353,V,To-day for me the spring without a name
354,V,Content or Grace or Laughter overflows.
355,V,
356,V,This is that water from the Fount of Gold
357,V,Water of Youth and washer out of cares
358,V,Which Raymond of Saragossa sought of old
359,V,"And finding in the mountain, unawares,"
360,V,Returned to hear an ancient story told
361,V,"To Bramimond, his love, beside the marble stairs."
362,V,
363,V,
364,VI,VI
365,VI,
366,VI,"Youth gave you to me, but I’ll not believe"
367,VI,"That Youth will, taking his quick self, take you."
368,VI,Youth’s all our Truth: he cannot so deceive.
369,VI,"He has our graces, not our ownselves too."
370,VI,"He still compares with time when he’ll be spent,"
371,VI,By human doom enhancing what we are;
372,VI,"Enriches us with rare experiment,"
373,VI,Lends arms to leagured Age in Time’s rough war.
374,VI,
375,VI,Look! This Youth in us is an Old Man taking
376,VI,A Boy to make him wiser than his days.
377,VI,So is our old Youth our young Age’s making:
378,VI,So rich in time our final debt he pays.
379,VI,Then with your quite young arms do you me hold
380,VI,And I will still be young when all the World’s grown old.
381,VI,
382,VI,
383,VII,VII
384,VII,
385,VII,Mortality is but the Stuff you wear
386,VII,To show the better on the imperfect sight.
387,VII,Your home is surely with the changeless light
388,VII,Of which you are the daughter and the heir.
389,VII,"For as you pass, the natural life of things"
390,VII,Proclaims the Resurrection: as you pass
391,VII,Remembered summer shines across the grass
392,VII,And somewhat in me of the immortal sings.
393,VII,
394,VII,"You were not made for memory, you are not"
395,VII,Youth’s accident I think but heavenly more;
396,VII,Moulding to meaning slips my pen’s poor blot
397,VII,And opening wide that long forbidden door
398,VII,"Where stands the Mother of God, your exemplar."
399,VII,"How beautiful, how beautiful you are!"
400,VII,
401,VII,
402,VIII,VIII
403,VIII,
404,VIII,Not for the luckless buds our roots may bear
405,VIII,"Now all in bloom, now seared and cankered lying"
406,VIII,"Will I entreat you, lest they should compare"
407,VIII,Foredoomed humanity with the fall of flowers.
408,VIII,Hold thou with me the chaste communion rare
409,VIII,And touch with life this mortal case of ours:
410,VIII,You’re lifted up beyond the power of dying:
411,VIII,"I die, as bounded things die everywhere."
412,VIII,
413,VIII,"You’re voiced companionship, I’m silence lonely;"
414,VIII,"You’re stuff, I’m void; you’re living, I’m decay."
415,VIII,"I fall, I think, to-night and ending only;"
416,VIII,"You rise, I know, through still advancing day."
417,VIII,And knowing living gift were life for me
418,VIII,In narrow room of rhyme I fixed it certainly.
419,VIII,
420,VIII,
421,IX,IX
422,IX,
423,IX,That which is one they shear and make it twain
424,IX,Who would Love’s light and dark discriminate:
425,IX,"His pleasure is one essence with his pain,"
426,IX,Even his desire twin brother to his hate.
427,IX,With him the foiled attempt is half achieving;
428,IX,"And being mastered, to be armed a lord;"
429,IX,And doubting every chance is still believing;
430,IX,And losing all one’s own is all reward.
431,IX,
432,IX,"I am acquainted with misfortune’s fortune,"
433,IX,And better than herself her dowry know:
434,IX,"For she that is my fortune and misfortune,"
435,IX,"Making me hapless, makes me happier so:"
436,IX,"In which conceit, as older men may prove,"
437,IX,Lies manifest the very core of Love.
438,IX,
439,IX,
440,X,X
441,X,
442,X,Shall any man for whose strong love another
443,X,"Has thrown away his wealth and name in one,"
444,X,Shall he turn mocker of a more than brother
445,X,To slight his need when his adventure’s done?
446,X,Or shall a breedless boy whose mother won him
447,X,In great men’s great concerns his little place
448,X,Turn when his farthing honours come upon him
449,X,To mock her yeoman air and conscious grace?
450,X,
451,X,"Then mock me as you do my narrow scope,"
452,X,For you it was put out this light of mine:
453,X,"Wrongfully wrecked my new adventured hope,"
454,X,"Wasted my wordy wealth, spilt my rich wine,"
455,X,Made my square ship within a league of shore
456,X,Alas! To be entombed in seas and seen no more.
457,X,
458,X,
459,XI,XI
460,XI,
461,XI,They that have taken wages of things done
462,XI,"When sense abused has blocked the doors of sense,"
463,XI,"They that have lost their heritage of the sun,"
464,XI,Their laughter and their holy innocence;
465,XI,"They turn them now to this thing, now to t’other,"
466,XI,"For anchor hold against swift-eddying time,"
467,XI,"Some to that square of earth which was their mother,"
468,XI,"And some to noisy fame, and some to rhyme."
469,XI,
470,XI,But I to that far morning where you stood
471,XI,"In fullness of the body, with your hands"
472,XI,"Reposing on your walls, before your lands,"
473,XI,"And all, together, making one great good:"
474,XI,Then did I cry “For this my birth was meant.
475,XI,"These are my use, and this my sacrament!”"
476,XI,
477,XI,
478,XII,XII
479,XII,
480,XII,Beauty that Parent is to deathless Rhyme
481,XII,"Was Manhood’s maker: you shall bear a Son,"
482,XII,Till Daughters linked adown admiring time
483,XII,"Fulfil the mother, handing Beauty on."
484,XII,"You shall by breeding make Life answer yet,"
485,XII,"In Time’s despite, Time’s jeer that men go void;"
486,XII,Your stamp of heaven shall be more largely set
487,XII,"Than my one joy, ten thousand times enjoyed."
488,XII,
489,XII,"The glories of our state and its achievement,"
490,XII,"Which wait their passing, shall not pass away."
491,XII,"I will extend our term beyond bereavement,"
492,XII,And launch our date into a dateless day.
493,XII,"For you shall make recórd, and when that’s sealed"
494,XII,"In Beauty made immortal, all is healed."
495,XII,
496,XII,
497,XIII,XIII
498,XIII,
499,XIII,What are the names for Beauty? Who shall praise
500,XIII,God’s pledge he can fulfil His creatures’ eyes?
501,XIII,Or what strong words of what creative phrase
502,XIII,Determine Beauty’s title in the skies?
503,XIII,"But I will call you Beauty Personate,"
504,XIII,"Ambassadorial Beauty, and again"
505,XIII,"Beauty triumphant, Beauty in the Gate,"
506,XIII,Beauty salvation of the souls of men.
507,XIII,
508,XIII,For Beauty was not Beauty till you came
509,XIII,And now shall Beauty mean the sign you are;
510,XIII,"A Beacon burnt above the Dawn, a flame"
511,XIII,"Like holy Lucifer the Morning Star,"
512,XIII,Who latest hangs in Heaven and is the gem
513,XIII,On all the widowéd Night’s expectant Diadem.
514,XIII,
515,XIII,
516,XIV,XIV
517,XIV,
518,XIV,"Love wooing Honour, Honour’s love did win"
519,XIV,And had his pleasure all a summer’s day.
520,XIV,"Not understanding how the dooms begin,"
521,XIV,"Love wooing Honour, wooed her life away."
522,XIV,Then wandered he a full five years unrest
523,XIV,"Until, one night, this Honour that had died"
524,XIV,"Came as he slept, in youth grown glorified"
525,XIV,And smiling like the Saints whom God has blest.
526,XIV,
527,XIV,But when he saw her on the clear night shine
528,XIV,"Serene with more than mortal light upon her,"
529,XIV,"The boy that careless was of things divine,"
530,XIV,"Small Love, turned penitent to worship Honour."
531,XIV,So Love can conquer Honour: when that’s past
532,XIV,Dead Honour risen outdoes Love at last.
533,XIV,
534,XIV,
535,XV,XV
536,XV,
537,XV,Your life is like a little winter’s day
538,XV,Whose sad sun rises late to set too soon;
539,XV,"You have just come--why will you go away,"
540,XV,Making an evening of what should be noon.
541,XV,Your life is like a little flute complaining
542,XV,"A long way off, beyond the willow trees:"
543,XV,"A long way off, and nothing left remaining"
544,XV,But memory of a music on the breeze.
545,XV,
546,XV,Your life is like a pitiful leave-taking
547,XV,"Wept in a dream before a man’s awaking,"
548,XV,A Call with only shadows to attend:
549,XV,A Benediction whispered and belated
550,XV,"Which has no fruit beyond a consecrated,"
551,XV,A consecrated silence at the end.
552,XV,
553,XV,
554,XVI,XVI
555,XVI,
556,XVI,Now shall the certain purpose of my soul
557,XVI,"By blind and empty things controlled be,"
558,XVI,And mine audacious course to that far goal
559,XVI,"Fall short, confessing mere mortality."
560,XVI,"Limbs shall have movement and ignore their living,"
561,XVI,"Brain wit, that he his quickness may deny."
562,XVI,"My promised hope forswears in act of giving,"
563,XVI,Time eats me up and makes my words a lie.
564,XVI,
565,XVI,"And mine unbounded dream has found a bar,"
566,XVI,And I must worst deceit of best things bear.
567,XVI,"Now dawn’s but daybreak, seas but waters are,"
568,XVI,"Night darkness only, all wide heaven just air:"
569,XVI,"And you to whom these fourteen lines I tell,"
570,XVI,"My beauty, my desire: but not my love as well."
571,XVI,
572,XVI,
573,XVII,XVII
574,XVII,
575,XVII,Because my faltering feet may fail to dare
576,XVII,The first descendant of the steps of Hell
577,XVII,Give me the Word in time that triumphs there.
578,XVII,I too must pass into the misty hollow
579,XVII,Where all our living laughter stops: and hark!
580,XVII,The tiny stuffless voices of the dark
581,XVII,"Have called me, called me, till I needs must follow:"
582,XVII,Give me the Word and I’ll attempt it well.
583,XVII,
584,XVII,Say it’s the little winking of an eye
585,XVII,Which in that issue is uncurtained quite;
586,XVII,A little sleep that helps a moment by
587,XVII,Between the thin dawn and the large daylight.
588,XVII,Ah! tell me more than yet was hoped of men;
589,XVII,"Swear that’s true now, and I’ll believe it then."
590,XVII,
591,XVII,
592,XVIII,XVIII
593,XVIII,
594,XVIII,When you to Acheron’s ugly water come
595,XVIII,Where darkness is and formless mourners brood
596,XVIII,And down the shelves of that distasteful flood
597,XVIII,Survey the human rank in order dumb.
598,XVIII,"When the pale dead go forward, tortured more"
599,XVIII,"By nothingness and longing than by fire,"
600,XVIII,"Which bear their hands in suppliance with desire,"
601,XVIII,With stretched desire for the ulterior shore.
602,XVIII,
603,XVIII,Then go before them like a royal ghost
604,XVIII,And tread like Egypt or like Carthage crowned;
605,XVIII,Because in your Mortality the most
606,XVIII,Of all we may inherit has been found--
607,XVIII,Children for memory: the Faith for pride.
608,XVIII,Good land to leave: and young Love satisfied.
609,XVIII,
610,XVIII,
611,XIX,XIX
612,XIX,
613,XIX,"We will not whisper, we have found the place"
614,XIX,Of silence and the endless halls of sleep.
615,XIX,And that which breathes alone throughout the deep
616,XIX,The end and the beginning: and the face
617,XIX,Between the level brows of whose blind eyes
618,XIX,"Lie plenary contentment, full surcease"
619,XIX,"Of violence, and the passionless long peace"
620,XIX,Wherein we lose our human lullabies.
621,XIX,
622,XIX,Look up and tell the immeasurable height
623,XIX,Between the vault of the world and your dear head;
624,XIX,"That’s death, my little sister, and the night"
625,XIX,"Which was our Mother beckons us to bed,"
626,XIX,Where large oblivion in her house is laid
627,XIX,"For us tired children, now our games are played."
628,XIX,
629,XIX,
630,XX,XX
631,XX,
632,XX,I went to sleep at Dawn in Tuscany
633,XX,Beneath a Rock and dreamt a morning dream.
634,XX,I thought I stood by that baptismal stream
635,XX,Whereon the bounds of our redemption lie.
636,XX,"And there, beyond, a radiance rose to take"
637,XX,"My soul at passing, in which light your eyes"
638,XX,So filled me I was drunk with Paradise.
639,XX,"Then the day broadened, but I did not wake."
640,XX,
641,XX,Here’s the last edge of my long parchment furled
642,XX,And all was writ that you might read it so.
643,XX,This sleep I swear shall last the length of day;
644,XX,"Not noise, not chance, shall drive this dream away:"
645,XX,"Not time, not treachery, not good fortune--no,"
646,XX,Not all the weight of all the wears of the world.
647,XX,
648,XX,
649,XXI,XXI
650,XXI,
651,XXI,"Almighty God, whose justice like a sun"
652,XXI,"Shall coruscate along the floors of Heaven,"
653,XXI,"Raising what’s low, perfecting what’s undone,"
654,XXI,Breaking the proud and making odd things even.
655,XXI,The poor of Jesus Christ along the street
656,XXI,"In your rain sodden, in your snows unshod,"
657,XXI,"They have nor hearth, nor sword, nor human meat,"
658,XXI,Nor even the bread of men: Almighty God.
659,XXI,
660,XXI,The poor of Jesus Christ whom no man hears
661,XXI,Have waited on your vengeance much too long.
662,XXI,Wipe out not tears but blood: our eyes bleed tears.
663,XXI,Come smite our damnéd sophistries so strong
664,XXI,That thy rude hammer battering this rude wrong
665,XXI,Ring down the abyss of twice ten thousand years.
666,XXI,
667,XXI,
668,XXII,XXII
669,XXII,
670,XXII,Mother of all my cities once there lay
671,XXII,About your weedy wharves an orient shower
672,XXII,Of spice and languorous silk and all the dower
673,XXII,That Ocean gave you on his bridal day.
674,XXII,And now the youth and age have passed away
675,XXII,And all the sail superb and all the power;
676,XXII,Your time’s a time of memory like that hour
677,XXII,"Just after sunset, wonderful and grey."
678,XXII,
679,XXII,"Too tired to rise and much too sad to weep,"
680,XXII,"With strong arm nerveless on a nerveless knee,"
681,XXII,Still to your slumbering ears the spousal deep
682,XXII,Murmurs his thoughts of eld eternally;
683,XXII,But your soul wakes not from its holy sleep
684,XXII,Dreaming of dead delights beside a tideless sea.
685,XXII,
686,XXII,
687,XXIII,XXIII
688,XXIII,
689,XXIII,November is that historied Emperor
690,XXIII,Conquered in age but foot to foot with fate
691,XXIII,Who from his refuge high has heard the roar
692,XXIII,"Of squadrons in pursuit, and now, too late,"
693,XXIII,"Stirrups the storm and calls the winds to war,"
694,XXIII,"And arms the garrison of his last heirloom,"
695,XXIII,And shakes the sky to its extremest shore
696,XXIII,With battle against irrevocable doom.
697,XXIII,
698,XXIII,"Till, driven and hurled from his strong citadels,"
699,XXIII,"He flies in hurrying cloud and spurs him on,"
700,XXIII,"Empty of lingerings, empty of farewells"
701,XXIII,And final benedictions and is gone.
702,XXIII,But in my garden all the trees have shed
703,XXIII,Their legacies of the light and all the flowers are dead.
704,XXIII,
705,XXIII,
706,XXIV,XXIV
707,XXIV,
708,XXIV,Hoar Time about the House betakes him slow
709,XXIV,Seeking an entry for his weariness.
710,XXIV,And in that dreadful company distress
711,XXIV,And the sad night with silent footsteps go.
712,XXIV,On my poor fire the brands are scarce aglow
713,XXIV,And in the woods without what memories press
714,XXIV,"Where, waning in the trees from less to less"
715,XXIV,Mysterious hangs the hornéd moon and low.
716,XXIV,
717,XXIV,"For now December, full of agéd care"
718,XXIV,Comes in upon the year and weakly grieves;
719,XXIV,Mumbling his lost desires and his despair
720,XXIV,And with mad trembling hand still interweaves
721,XXIV,"The dank sear flower-stalks tangled in his hair,"
722,XXIV,While round about him whirl the rotten leaves.
723,XXIV,
724,XXIV,
725,XXV,XXV
726,XXV,
727,XXV,It freezes: all across a soundless sky
728,XXV,The birds go home. The governing dark’s begun.
729,XXV,The steadfast dark that waits not for a sun;
730,XXV,The ultimate dark wherein the race shall die.
731,XXV,Death with his evil finger to his lip
732,XXV,"Leers in at human windows, turning spy"
733,XXV,To learn the country where his rule shall lie
734,XXV,When he assumes perpetual generalship.
735,XXV,
736,XXV,"The undefeated enemy, the chill"
737,XXV,"That shall benumb the voiceful earth at last,"
738,XXV,"Is master of our moment, and has bound"
739,XXV,The viewless wind itself. There is no sound.
740,XXV,It freezes. Every friendly stream is fast.
741,XXV,"It freezes, and the graven twigs are still."
742,XXV,
743,XXV,
744,XXVI,XXVI
745,XXVI,
746,XXVI,"O my companion, O my sister Sleep,"
747,XXVI,"The valley is all before us, bear me on."
748,XXVI,"High through the heaven of evening, hardly gone,"
749,XXVI,"Beyond the harbour lights, beyond the steep,"
750,XXVI,Beyond the land and its lost benison
751,XXVI,"To where, majestic on the darkening deep,"
752,XXVI,The night comes forward from Mount Aurion.
753,XXVI,"O my companion, O my sister Sleep."
754,XXVI,
755,XXVI,"Above the surf-line, into the night-breeze;"
756,XXVI,Eastward above the ever-whispering seas;
757,XXVI,Through the warm airs with no more watch to keep.
758,XXVI,My day’s run out and all its dooms are graven.
759,XXVI,O dear forerunner of Death and promise of Haven.
760,XXVI,"O my companion, O my sister Sleep."
761,XXVI,
762,XXVI,
763,XXVII,XXVII
764,XXVII,
765,XXVII,"Are you the end, Despair, or the poor least"
766,XXVII,Of them that cast great shadows and are lies?
767,XXVII,"That dread the simple and destroy the wise,"
768,XXVII,Fail at the tomb and triumph at the feast?
769,XXVII,"You were not found on Olivet, dull beast,"
770,XXVII,"Nor in Thebaid, when the night’s agonies"
771,XXVII,Dissolved to glory on the effulgent east
772,XXVII,And Jesus Christ was in the morning skies.
773,XXVII,
774,XXVII,You did not curb the indomitable crest
775,XXVII,"Of Tzerna-Gora, when the Falcon-bred"

989,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"That are sodden and unkind,"

997,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And it’s there walking in the high woods
998,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"That I could wish to be,"
999,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the men that were boys when I was a boy
1000,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Walking along with me.
1001,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
1002,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,The men that live in North England
1003,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,I saw them for a day:
1004,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,"
1005,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Their skies are fast and grey;
1006,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,From their castle-walls a man may see

1010,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They see the Severn strong,"

1012,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,Light aspen leaves along.
1013,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They have the secret of the Rocks,"
1014,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the oldest kind of song.
1015,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,
1016,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,But the men that live in the South Country
1017,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"Are the kindest and most wise,"
1018,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"They get their laughter from the loud surf,"
1019,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the faith in their happy eyes

1021,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,When over the sea she flies;

1046,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,"If I ever become a rich man,"

1050,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And there shall the Sussex songs be sung
1051,THE SOUTH COUNTRY,And the story of Sussex told.

1064,THE FANATIC,"Last night in Compton Street, Soho,"
1065,THE FANATIC,A man whom many of you know
1066,THE FANATIC,Gave up the ghost at half past nine.
1067,THE FANATIC,That evening he had been to dine
1068,THE FANATIC,"At Gressington’s--an act unwise,"
1069,THE FANATIC,But not the cause of his demise.
1070,THE FANATIC,The doctors all agree that he
1071,THE FANATIC,Was touched with cardiac atrophy
1072,THE FANATIC,Accelerated (more or less)
1073,THE FANATIC,"By lack of proper food, distress,"
1074,THE FANATIC,"Uncleanliness, and loss of sleep."
1075,THE FANATIC,He was a man that could not keep
1076,THE FANATIC,His money (when he had the same)
1077,THE FANATIC,Because of creditors who came
1078,THE FANATIC,And took it from him; and he gave
1079,THE FANATIC,So freely that he could not save.
1080,THE FANATIC,But all the while a sort of whim
1081,THE FANATIC,"Persistently remained with him,"
1082,THE FANATIC,"Half admirable, half absurd:"
1083,THE FANATIC,"To keep his word, to keep his word...."
1084,THE FANATIC,By which he did not mean what you
1085,THE FANATIC,And I would mean (of payments due
1086,THE FANATIC,Or punctual rental of the Flat--
1087,THE FANATIC,He was a deal too mad for that)
1088,THE FANATIC,But--as he put it with a fine
1089,THE FANATIC,"Abandon, foolish or divine--"
1090,THE FANATIC,But “That great word which every man
1091,THE FANATIC,Gave God before his life began.”
1092,THE FANATIC,"It was a sacred word, he said,"
1093,THE FANATIC,Which comforted the pathless dead
1094,THE FANATIC,And made God smile when it was shown
1095,THE FANATIC,"Unforfeited, before the Throne."
1096,THE FANATIC,And this (he said) he meant to hold
1097,THE FANATIC,"In spite of debt, and hate, and cold;"
1098,THE FANATIC,And this (he said) he meant to show
1099,THE FANATIC,As passport to the Wards below.
1100,THE FANATIC,He boasted of it and gave praise
1101,THE FANATIC,To his own self through all his days.
1102,THE FANATIC,He wrote a record to preserve
1103,THE FANATIC,How steadfastly he did not swerve
1104,THE FANATIC,From keeping it; how stiff he stood
1105,THE FANATIC,"Its guardian, and maintained it good."
1106,THE FANATIC,He had two witnesses to swear
1107,THE FANATIC,He kept it once in Berkeley Square.
1108,THE FANATIC,(Where hardly anything survives)
1109,THE FANATIC,"And, through the loneliest of lives"
1110,THE FANATIC,"He kept it clean, he kept it still,"
1111,THE FANATIC,Down to the last extremes of ill.
1112,THE FANATIC,"So when he died, of many friends"
1113,THE FANATIC,Who came in crowds from all the ends
1114,THE FANATIC,"Of London, that it might be known"
1115,THE FANATIC,"They knew the man who died alone,"
1116,THE FANATIC,"Some, who had thought his mood sublime"
1117,THE FANATIC,"And sent him soup from time to time,"
1118,THE FANATIC,"Said, “Well, you cannot make them fit"
1119,THE FANATIC,"The world, and there’s an end of it!”"
1120,THE FANATIC,"But others, wondering at him, said:"
1121,THE FANATIC,“The man that kept his word is dead!”
1122,THE FANATIC,"Then angrily, a certain third"
1123,THE FANATIC,"Cried, “Gentlemen, he kept his word."
1124,THE FANATIC,And as a man whom beasts surround
1125,THE FANATIC,"Tumultuous, on a little mound"
1126,THE FANATIC,"Stands Archer, for one dreadful hour,"
1127,THE FANATIC,Because a Man is born to Power--
1128,THE FANATIC,"And still, to daunt the pack below,"
1129,THE FANATIC,"Twangs the clear purpose of his bow,"
1130,THE FANATIC,Till overwhelmed he dares to fall:
1131,THE FANATIC,So stood this bulwark of us all.
1132,THE FANATIC,He kept his word as none but he
1133,THE FANATIC,"Could keep it, and as did not we."
1134,THE FANATIC,And round him as he kept his word
1135,THE FANATIC,"To-day’s diseased and faithless herd,"
1136,THE FANATIC,"A moment loud, a moment strong,"
1137,THE FANATIC,"But foul forever, rolled along.”"

1176,OUR LORD AND OUR LADY,"Our Lady stood beside the Cross,"

1206,COURTESY,
1207,COURTESY,The first was of Saint Gabriel;

1210,COURTESY,He shone with Heavenly Courtesy.
1211,COURTESY,
1212,COURTESY,Our Lady out of Nazareth rode--

1216,COURTESY,
1217,COURTESY,"The third it was our Little Lord,"
1218,COURTESY,Whom all the Kings in arms adored;
1219,COURTESY,He was so small you could not see
1220,COURTESY,His large intent of Courtesy.
