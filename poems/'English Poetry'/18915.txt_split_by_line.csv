196,PREFACE.,A Ninth Edition of the following Poems having been called for by the
197,PREFACE.,"public, the author is induced to say a few words, particularly"
198,PREFACE.,"concerning those which, under the name of Sonnets, describe his personal"
199,PREFACE.,feelings.
200,PREFACE.,
201,PREFACE.,They can be considered in no other light than as exhibiting occasional
202,PREFACE.,"reflections which naturally arose in his mind, chiefly during various"
203,PREFACE.,"excursions, undertaken to relieve, at the time, depression of spirits."
204,PREFACE.,"They were, therefore, in general, suggested by the scenes before them;"
205,PREFACE.,and wherever such scenes appeared to harmonise with his disposition at
206,PREFACE.,"the moment, the sentiments were involuntarily prompted."
207,PREFACE.,
208,PREFACE.,"Numberless poetical trifles of the same kind have occurred to him, when"
209,PREFACE.,"perhaps, in his solitary rambles, he has been ""chewing the cud of sweet"
210,PREFACE.,"and bitter fancy;"" but they have been forgotten as he left the places"
211,PREFACE.,which gave rise to them; and the greater part of those originally
212,PREFACE.,"committed to the press were written down, for the first time, from"
213,PREFACE.,memory.
214,PREFACE.,
215,PREFACE.,This is nothing to the public; but it may serve in some measure to
216,PREFACE.,"obviate the common remark on melancholy poetry, that it has been very"
217,PREFACE.,"often gravely composed, when possibly the heart of the writer had very"
218,PREFACE.,little share in the distress he chose to describe.
219,PREFACE.,
220,PREFACE.,But there is a great difference between _natural_ and _fabricated_
221,PREFACE.,"feelings, even in poetry. To which of these two characters the poems"
222,PREFACE.,"before the reader belong, the author leaves those who have felt"
223,PREFACE.,sensations of sorrow to judge.
224,PREFACE.,
225,PREFACE.,"They who know him, know the occasions of them to have been real; to the"
226,PREFACE.,public he might only mention the sudden death of a deserving young
227,PREFACE.,"woman, with whom,"
228,PREFACE.,

245,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"may be proper to state, that to the best of my recollection, they now"

247,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"when, in youth a wanderer among distant scenes, I sought forgetfulness"

254,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,and many had escaped my recollection;[2] but three years after my return

260,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,
261,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"passing through Bath, I wrote down all I could recollect of these"
262,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"effusions, most elaborately _mending_ the versification from the natural"
263,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"flow of music in which they occurred to me, and having thus _corrected_"
264,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"and written them out, took them myself to the late Mr Cruttwell, with"
265,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"the name of ""Fourteen Sonnets, written chiefly on Picturesque Spots"
266,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"during a Journey."""
267,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,
268,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"I had three times knocked at this amiable printer's door, whose kind"
269,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"smile I still recollect; and at last, with much hesitation, ventured to"
270,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,unfold my message; it was to inquire whether he would give any thing for
271,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"""Fourteen Sonnets,"" to be published with or without the name.[3] He at"
272,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"once declined the purchase, and informed me he doubted very much whether"
273,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"the publication would repay the expense of printing, which would come to"
274,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"about five pounds. It was at last determined one hundred copies, in"
275,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"quarto, should be published as a kind of ""forlorn hope;"" and these"
276,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"""Fourteen Sonnets"" I left to their fate and thought no more of getting"
277,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"rich by poetry! In fact, I owed the most I ever owed at Oxford, at this"
278,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"time, namely, seventy pounds;[4] and knowing my father's large family"
279,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"and trying circumstances, and those of my poor mother, I shrunk from"
280,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"asking more money when I left home, and went back with a heavy heart to"
281,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"Oxford, under the conscious weight, that my poetic scheme failing, I had"
282,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"no means of paying Parsons, the mercer's, bill! This was the origin of"
283,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,the publication.
284,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,
285,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,As this plain account is so connected with whatever may be my name in
286,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"criticism and poetry, it is hoped it will be pardoned."
287,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,
288,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"All thoughts of succeeding as a poet were now abandoned; but, half a"
289,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"year afterwards, I received a letter from the printer informing me that"
290,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"the hundred copies were all sold, adding, that if I had published FIVE"
291,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"HUNDRED copies, he had no doubt they would have been sold also."
292,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,
293,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"This, in my then situation, my father now dead, and my mother a widow"
294,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"with seven children, and with a materially reduced income (from the loss"
295,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"of the rectories of Uphill and Brean in Somerset), was gratifying"
296,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,indeed; all my golden dreams of poetical success were renewed;--the
297,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"number of the sonnets first published was increased, and five hundred"
298,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"copies, by the congratulating printer, with whose family I have lived in"
299,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"kindest amity from that hour, were recommended to issue from the press"
300,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,of the editor of the _Bath Chronicle_.
301,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,
302,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"But this was not all, the five hundred copies were sold to great"
303,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"advantage, for it was against my will that _five hundred_ copies should"
304,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"be printed, till the printer told me he would take the risk on himself,"
305,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"on the usual terms, at that time, of bookseller and author."
306,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,
307,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"Soon afterwards, it was agreed that _seven hundred and fifty_ copies"
308,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"should be printed, in a smaller and elegant size. I had received"
309,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"Coleridge's warm testimony; but soon after this third edition came out,"
310,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"my friend, Mr Cruttwell, the printer, wrote a letter saying that two"
311,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"young gentlemen, strangers, one a particularly handsome and pleasing"
312,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"youth, lately from Westminster School, and both literary and"
313,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"intelligent, spoke in high commendation of my volume, and if I recollect"
314,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"right, expressed a desire to have some poems printed in the same type"
315,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"and form. Who these young men were I knew not at the time, but the"
316,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,communication of the circumstance was to me most gratifying; and how
317,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"much more gratifying, when, from one of them, after he himself had"
318,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,achieved the fame of one of the most virtuous and eloquent of the
319,INTRODUCTION TO THE EDITION OF 1837.,"writers in his generation, I received a first visit at my parsonage in"

2850,COLLINS.,"These sounds I heard amid this mortal road,"

2853,COLLINS.,"I raised mine eyes, sickness had long depressed,"

2855,COLLINS.,
2856,COLLINS.,"The storm of night had ceased upon the plain,"
2857,COLLINS.,"When thoughtful in the forest-walk I strayed,"
2858,COLLINS.,To the long hollow murmur of the main
2859,COLLINS.,"Listening, and to the many leaves that made"
2860,COLLINS.,"A drowsy cadence, as the high trees waved;"
2861,COLLINS.,When straight a beauteous scene burst on my sight;
2862,COLLINS.,Smooth were the waters that the lowland laved:
2863,COLLINS.,"And lo! a form, as of some fairy sprite,"
2864,COLLINS.,"Who held in her right hand a budding spray,"
2865,COLLINS.,And like a sea-maid sung her sweetly warbled lay.
2866,COLLINS.,
2867,COLLINS.,Soothing as steals the summer-wave she sung:
2868,COLLINS.,The grisly phantoms of the night are gone
2869,COLLINS.,To hear in shades forlorn the death-bell rung;
2870,COLLINS.,"But thou whom sickness hast left weak and wan,"

2876,COLLINS.,The soothest sprite that sings on life's long wilderness.
2877,COLLINS.,
2878,COLLINS.,"As slowly ceased her tender voice, I stood"
2879,COLLINS.,"Delighted: the hard way, so lately passed,"
2880,COLLINS.,Seemed smooth; the ocean's bright extended flood
2881,COLLINS.,Before me stretched; the clouds that overcast
2882,COLLINS.,"Heaven's melancholy vault hurried away,"
2883,COLLINS.,"Driven seaward, and the azure hills appeared;"
2884,COLLINS.,"The sunbeams shone upon their summits gray,"
2885,COLLINS.,"Strange saddening sounds no more by fits were heard,"
2886,COLLINS.,"But birds, in new leaves shrouded, sung aloft,"
2887,COLLINS.,And o'er the level seas Spring's healing airs blew soft.
2888,COLLINS.,
2889,COLLINS.,"As when a traveller, who many days"
2890,COLLINS.,"Hath journeyed 'mid Arabian deserts still,"
2891,COLLINS.,"A dreary solitude far on surveys,"
2892,COLLINS.,"And met, nor flitting bird, nor gushing rill,"
2893,COLLINS.,"But near some marble ruin, gleaming pale,"
2894,COLLINS.,"Sighs mindful of the haunts of cheerful man,"
2895,COLLINS.,And thinks he hears in every sickly gale
2896,COLLINS.,The bells of some approaching caravan;
2897,COLLINS.,"At length, emerging o'er the dim tract, sees"
2898,COLLINS.,"Damascus' golden fanes, and minarets, and trees:"
2899,COLLINS.,
2900,COLLINS.,So beat my bosom when my winding way
2901,COLLINS.,"Led through the thickets to a sheltered vale,"
2902,COLLINS.,Where the fair syren sat; a smooth clear bay
2903,COLLINS.,"Skirted with woods appeared, where many a sail"
2904,COLLINS.,"Went shining o'er the watery surface still,"
2905,COLLINS.,Lessening at last in the gray ocean flood;
2906,COLLINS.,"And yonder, half-way up the fronting hill,"
2907,COLLINS.,"Peeping from forth the trees, a cottage stood,"
2908,COLLINS.,"Above whose peaceful umbrage, trailing high,"
2909,COLLINS.,"A little smoke went up, and stained the cloudless sky."
2910,COLLINS.,
2911,COLLINS.,"I turned, and lo! a mountain seemed to rise,"
2912,COLLINS.,Upon whose top a spiry citadel
2913,COLLINS.,"Lifted its dim-seen turrets to the skies,"
2914,COLLINS.,Where some high lord of the domain might dwell;
2915,COLLINS.,"And onward, where the eye scarce stretched its sight,"
2916,COLLINS.,"Hills over hills in long succession rose,"
2917,COLLINS.,"Touched with a softer and yet softer light,"
2918,COLLINS.,And all was blended as in deep repose;
2919,COLLINS.,"The woods, the sea, the hills that shone so fair,"
2920,COLLINS.,"Till woods, and sea, and hills seemed fading into air."
2921,COLLINS.,
2922,COLLINS.,"At once, methought, I saw a various throng"
2923,COLLINS.,To this enchanting spot their footsteps bend;
2924,COLLINS.,"All drawn, sweet Hope! by thy inspiring song,"
2925,COLLINS.,Which melodies scarce mortal seem to blend.
2926,COLLINS.,"First buxom Youth, with cheeks of glowing red,"
2927,COLLINS.,"Came lightly tripping o'er the morning dew,"
2928,COLLINS.,"He wore a harebell garland on his head,"
2929,COLLINS.,And stretched his hands at the bright-bursting view:
2930,COLLINS.,"A mountain fawn went bounding by his side,"
2931,COLLINS.,Around whose slender neck a silver bell was tied.
2932,COLLINS.,
2933,COLLINS.,"Then said I: Mistress of the magic song,"
2934,COLLINS.,"Oh, pity 'twere that hearts that know no guile"
2935,COLLINS.,Should ever feel the pangs of truth or wrong!
2936,COLLINS.,"She heeded not, but sang with lovelier smile:"
2937,COLLINS.,"Enjoy, O youth, the season of thy May;"
2938,COLLINS.,"Hark, how the throstles in the hawthorn sing!"
2939,COLLINS.,"The hoary Time, that resteth night nor day,"
2940,COLLINS.,O'er the earth's shade may speed with noiseless wing;
2941,COLLINS.,"But heed not thou; snatch the brief joys that rise,"
2942,COLLINS.,And sport beneath the light of these unclouded skies.
2943,COLLINS.,
2944,COLLINS.,"His fine eye flashing an unwonted fire,"
2945,COLLINS.,Then Fancy o'er the glade delighted went;
2946,COLLINS.,"He struck at times a small and silver lyre,"
2947,COLLINS.,Or gazed upon the rolling element;
2948,COLLINS.,"Sometimes he took his mirror, which did show"
2949,COLLINS.,The various landscape lovelier than the life;
2950,COLLINS.,"Beaming more bright the vivid tints did glow,"
2951,COLLINS.,"And so well mingled was the colours' strife,"
2952,COLLINS.,"That the fond heart, the beauteous shades once seen,"
2953,COLLINS.,"Would sigh for such retreats, for vales and woods so green!"
2954,COLLINS.,
2955,COLLINS.,"Gay was his aspect, and his airy vest,"
2956,COLLINS.,"As loose it flowed, such colours did display,"
2957,COLLINS.,"As paint the clouds reposing in the west,"
2958,COLLINS.,Or the moist rainbow's radiant arch inlay;
2959,COLLINS.,"And now he tripped, like fairy of the wood,"
2960,COLLINS.,"And seemed with dancing spirits to rejoice,"
2961,COLLINS.,And now he hung his head in pensive mood:
2962,COLLINS.,"Meantime, O Hope! he listened to thy voice,"
2963,COLLINS.,"And whilst of joy and youth it cheerly sung,"
2964,COLLINS.,"He touched his answering harp, and o'er the valley sprung."
2965,COLLINS.,
2966,COLLINS.,"Pleasure, a frolic nymph, to the glad sound"
2967,COLLINS.,"Came dancing, as all tears she might forget;"
2968,COLLINS.,"And now she gazed with a sweet archness round,"
2969,COLLINS.,And wantonly displayed a silken net:
2970,COLLINS.,She won her way with fascinating air--
2971,COLLINS.,"Her eyes illumined with a tender light,"
2972,COLLINS.,"Her smile's strange blandishment, her shaded hair"
2973,COLLINS.,"That lengthening hung, her teeth as ivory white,"
2974,COLLINS.,"That peeped from her moist lip, seemed to inspire"
2975,COLLINS.,"Tumultuous wishes warm, and dreams of fond desire."
2976,COLLINS.,
2977,COLLINS.,"What softer passions did thy bosom move,"
2978,COLLINS.,"When those melodious measures met thine ear,"
2979,COLLINS.,"Child of Sincerity, and virtuous Love!"
2980,COLLINS.,Thine eyes did shine beneath a blissful tear
2981,COLLINS.,"That still were turned towards the tranquil scene,"
2982,COLLINS.,Where the thin smoke rose from the embowered cot;
2983,COLLINS.,"And thou didst think, that there, with smile serene,"
2984,COLLINS.,"In quiet shades, and every pang forgot,"
2985,COLLINS.,"Thou mightest sink on pure Affection's breast,"
2986,COLLINS.,And listen to the winds that whispered thee to rest.
2987,COLLINS.,
2988,COLLINS.,"I thought, O Love, how seldom art thou found"
2989,COLLINS.,Without annoyance in this earthly state!
2990,COLLINS.,"For, haply, thou dost feed some rankling wound,"
2991,COLLINS.,"Or on thy youth pale poverty doth wait,"
2992,COLLINS.,"Till years, on heavy wing, have rolled away;"
2993,COLLINS.,"Or where thou most didst hope firm faith to see,"
2994,COLLINS.,Thou meetest fickleness estranged and cold;
2995,COLLINS.,"Or if some true and tender heart there be,"
2996,COLLINS.,"On which, through every change, thy soul might trust,"
2997,COLLINS.,"Death comes with his fell dart, and smites it to the dust!"
2998,COLLINS.,
2999,COLLINS.,"But lusty Enterprise, with looks of glee,"
3000,COLLINS.,"Approached the drooping youth, as he would say,"
3001,COLLINS.,"Come to the high woods and the hills with me,"
3002,COLLINS.,And cast thy sullen myrtle-wreath away.
3003,COLLINS.,"Upon a neighing courser he did sit,"
3004,COLLINS.,"That stretched its arched neck, in conscious pride,"
3005,COLLINS.,"And champed as with disdain a golden bit,"
3006,COLLINS.,"But Hope her animating voice applied,"
3007,COLLINS.,"And Enterprise with speed impetuous passed,"
3008,COLLINS.,Whilst the long vale returned his wreathed bugle's blast.
3009,COLLINS.,
3010,COLLINS.,"Suddenly, lifting high his ponderous spear,"
3011,COLLINS.,"A mailed man came forth with scornful pride,"
3012,COLLINS.,"I saw him, towering in his proud career,"
3013,COLLINS.,Along the valley with a giant stride:
3014,COLLINS.,"Upon his helm, in letters of bright gold,"
3015,COLLINS.,"That to the sun's meridian splendour shone,"
3016,COLLINS.,Ambition's name far off I might behold.
3017,COLLINS.,Meantime from earth there came a hollow moan;
3018,COLLINS.,"But Fame, who followed, her loud trumpet blew,"
3019,COLLINS.,And to the murmuring beach with eyes a-flame he flew.
3020,COLLINS.,
3021,COLLINS.,"And now already had he gained the strand,"
3022,COLLINS.,"Where a tall vessel rode with sail unfurled,"
3023,COLLINS.,"And soon he thought to reach the farther land,"
3024,COLLINS.,Which to his eager eye seemed like a world
3025,COLLINS.,That he by strength might win and make his own;
3026,COLLINS.,"And in that citadel, which shone so bright,"
3027,COLLINS.,"Seat him, a purple sovereign, on his throne."
3028,COLLINS.,"So he went tilting o'er the waters white,"
3029,COLLINS.,"And whilst he oft looked back with stern disdain,"
3030,COLLINS.,"In louder tone, methought, was heard the inspiring strain:"
3031,COLLINS.,
3032,COLLINS.,"By the shade of cities old,[47]"
3033,COLLINS.,"By many a river stained with gore,"
3034,COLLINS.,"By the sword of Sesac bold,"
3035,COLLINS.,Who smote the nations from the shore
3036,COLLINS.,"Of ancient Nile to India's farthest plain,"
3037,COLLINS.,"By Fame's proud pillars, and by Valour's shield"
3038,COLLINS.,"By mighty chiefs in glorious battle slain,"
3039,COLLINS.,Assert thy sway; amid the bloody field
3040,COLLINS.,"Pursue thy march, and to the heights sublime"
3041,COLLINS.,"Of Honour's glittering cliffs, a mighty conqueror climb!"
3042,COLLINS.,
3043,COLLINS.,"Then said I, in my heart: Man, thou dost rear"
3044,COLLINS.,"Thine eye to heaven, and vaunt thy lofty worth;"
3045,COLLINS.,The ensign of dominion thou dost bear
3046,COLLINS.,"O'er nature's works; but thou dost oft go forth,"
3047,COLLINS.,"Urged by proud hopes to ravage and destroy,"
3048,COLLINS.,Thou dost build up a name by cruel deeds;
3049,COLLINS.,"Whilst to the peaceful scenes of love and joy,"
3050,COLLINS.,"Sorrow, and crime, and solitude, succeeds."
3051,COLLINS.,"Hence, when her war-song Victory doth sing,"
3052,COLLINS.,Destruction flaps aloft her iron-hurtling wing.
3053,COLLINS.,
3054,COLLINS.,"But see, as one awakened from a trance,"
3055,COLLINS.,"With hollow and dim eyes and stony stare,"
3056,COLLINS.,Captivity with faltering step advance!
3057,COLLINS.,Dripping and knotted was her coal-black hair;
3058,COLLINS.,"For she had long been hid, as in the grave;"
3059,COLLINS.,"No sounds the silence of her prison broke,"
3060,COLLINS.,"Nor one companion had she in her cave,"
3061,COLLINS.,"Save Terror's dismal shape, that no word spoke;"
3062,COLLINS.,But to a stony coffin on the floor
3063,COLLINS.,With lean and hideous finger pointed evermore.
3064,COLLINS.,
3065,COLLINS.,"The lark's shrill song, the early village chime,"
3066,COLLINS.,"The upland echo of the winding horn,"
3067,COLLINS.,"The far-heard clock that spoke the passing time,"
3068,COLLINS.,Had never pierced her solitude forlorn;
3069,COLLINS.,"At length, released from the deep dungeon's gloom,"
3070,COLLINS.,She feels the fragrance of the vernal gale;
3071,COLLINS.,"She sees more sweet the living landscape bloom,"
3072,COLLINS.,"And while she listens to Hope's tender tale,"
3073,COLLINS.,"She thinks her long-lost friends shall bless her sight,"
3074,COLLINS.,And almost faints with joy amid the broad daylight.
3075,COLLINS.,
3076,COLLINS.,"And near the spot, as with reluctant feet,"
3077,COLLINS.,"Slowly desponding Melancholy drew,"
3078,COLLINS.,"The wind and rain her naked breast had beat,"
3079,COLLINS.,"Sunk was her eye, and sallow was her hue:"
3080,COLLINS.,In the huge forest's unrejoicing shade
3081,COLLINS.,"Bewildered had she wandered day by day,"
3082,COLLINS.,"And many a grisly fiend her heart dismayed,"
3083,COLLINS.,And cold and wet upon the ground she lay;
3084,COLLINS.,"But now such sounds with mellow sweetness stole,"
3085,COLLINS.,As lapped in dreams of bliss her slow-consenting soul.
3086,COLLINS.,
3087,COLLINS.,"Next, to the woody glen poor Mania strayed,"
3088,COLLINS.,"Most pale and wild, yet gentle was her look;"
3089,COLLINS.,"A slender garland she of straw had made,"
3090,COLLINS.,Of flowers and rushes from the running brook;
3091,COLLINS.,"But as she sadly passed, the tender sound"
3092,COLLINS.,Of its sharp pang her wounded heart beguiled;
3093,COLLINS.,"She dropped her half-made garland on the ground,"
3094,COLLINS.,"And then she sighed, and then in tears she smiled:"
3095,COLLINS.,"But in such sort, that Pity would have said,"
3096,COLLINS.,"O GOD, be merciful to that poor hapless maid!"
3097,COLLINS.,
3098,COLLINS.,Now ravingly she cried: The whelming main--
3099,COLLINS.,The wintry wave rolls over his cold head;
3100,COLLINS.,I never shall behold his form again;
3101,COLLINS.,"Hence flattering fancies--he is dead, is dead!"
3102,COLLINS.,"Perhaps on some wild shore he may be cast,"
3103,COLLINS.,"Where on their prey barbarians howling rush,"
3104,COLLINS.,"Oh, fiercer they, than is the whelming blast!"
3105,COLLINS.,"Hush, my poor heart! my wakeful sorrows, hush!"
3106,COLLINS.,"He lives! I yet shall press him to my heart,"
3107,COLLINS.,"And cry, Oh no, no, no,--we never more will part!"
3108,COLLINS.,
3109,COLLINS.,"So sang she, when despairing, from his cell,"
3110,COLLINS.,"Hid furthest in the lone umbrageous wood,"
3111,COLLINS.,"Where many a winter he had loved to dwell,"
3112,COLLINS.,"Came grim Remorse; fixed in deep thought he stood,"
3113,COLLINS.,His senses pierced by the unwonted tone;
3114,COLLINS.,Some stagnant blood-drops from his locks he shook;
3115,COLLINS.,"He saw the trees that waved, the sun that shone,"
3116,COLLINS.,He cast around an agonised look;
3117,COLLINS.,"Then with a ghastly smile, that spoke his pain,"
3118,COLLINS.,He hied him to his cave in thickest shades again.
3119,COLLINS.,
3120,COLLINS.,"And now the sun sank westward, and the sky"
3121,COLLINS.,Was hung with thousand lucid pictures gay;
3122,COLLINS.,"When gazing on the scene{c} with placid eye,"
3123,COLLINS.,An ancient man appeared in amice gray;
3124,COLLINS.,"His sandal shoes were by long travel worn,"
3125,COLLINS.,"O'er hill and valley, many a weary mile,"
3126,COLLINS.,"Yet drooped he not, like one in years forlorn;"
3127,COLLINS.,"His pale cheek wore a sad, but tender smile;"
3128,COLLINS.,"'Twas sage Experience, by his look confessed,"
3129,COLLINS.,And white as frost his beard descended to his breast.
3130,COLLINS.,
3131,COLLINS.,"Thus said I: Master, pleasant is this place,"
3132,COLLINS.,"And sweet are those melodious notes I hear,"
3133,COLLINS.,And happy they among man's toiling race
3134,COLLINS.,"Who, of their cares forgetful, wander near;"
3135,COLLINS.,"Me they delight, whom sickness and slow pain"
3136,COLLINS.,Have bowed almost to death with heavy hand;
3137,COLLINS.,"The fairy scenes refresh my heart again,"
3138,COLLINS.,"And, pleased, I listen to that music bland,"
3139,COLLINS.,"Which seems to promise hours of joy to come,"
3140,COLLINS.,And bids me tranquil seek my poor but peaceful home.[48]
3141,COLLINS.,
3142,COLLINS.,"He said: Alas! these shadows soon may fly,"
3143,COLLINS.,Like the gay creatures of the element;
3144,COLLINS.,Yet do poor mortals still with raptured eye
3145,COLLINS.,Behold like thee the pictures they present;
3146,COLLINS.,"And, charmed by Hope's sweet music, on they fare,"
3147,COLLINS.,"And think they soon shall reach that blissful goal,"
3148,COLLINS.,Where never more the sullen knell of Care
3149,COLLINS.,For buried friends and severed loves shall toll:
3150,COLLINS.,"So on they fare, till all their troubles cease,"
3151,COLLINS.,And on a lap of earth they lie them down in peace.
3152,COLLINS.,
3153,COLLINS.,But not there ceases their immortal claim;
3154,COLLINS.,From golden clouds I heard a small voice say:
3155,COLLINS.,"Wisdom rejoiceth in a higher aim,"
3156,COLLINS.,Nor heeds the transient shadows of a day;
3157,COLLINS.,"These earthly sounds may die away, and all"
3158,COLLINS.,"These perishable pictures sink in night,"
3159,COLLINS.,"But Virtue from the dust her sons shall call,"
3160,COLLINS.,"And lead them forth to joy, and life, and light;"
3161,COLLINS.,"Though from their languid grasp earth's comforts fly,"
3162,COLLINS.,And with the silent worm their buried bodies lie.
3163,COLLINS.,
3164,COLLINS.,For other scenes there are; and in a clime
3165,COLLINS.,"Purer, and other strains to earth unknown,"
3166,COLLINS.,"Where heaven's high host, with symphonies sublime,"
3167,COLLINS.,Sing unto Him that sitteth on the throne.

4233,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Its lucid line along; and on its side
4234,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The bordering pastures green, where the swinked ox"
4235,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Lies dreaming, heedless of the numerous flies"
4236,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That, in the transitory sunshine, hum                            130"
4237,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Round his broad breast; and further up the cot,"
4238,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With blue, light smoke ascending; images"
4239,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Of peace and comfort! The wild rocks around
4240,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Endear your smile the more, and the full mind,"
4241,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Sliding from scenes of dread magnificence,"
4242,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Sinks on your charms reposing; such repose
4243,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The sage may feel, when, filled and half-oppressed"
4244,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With vast conceptions, smiling he returns"
4245,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"To life's consoling sympathies, and hears,"
4246,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With heartfelt tenderness, the bells ring out;                   140"
4247,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Or pipe upon the mountains; or the low
4248,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Of herds slow winding down the cottaged vale,"
4249,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Where day's last sunshine linger. Such repose
4250,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"He feels, who, following where his SHAKSPEARE leads,"
4251,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"As in a dream, through an enchanted land,"
4252,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Here, with Macbeth, in the dread cavern hails"
4253,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The weird sisters, and the dismal deed"
4254,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Without a name; there sees the charmed isle,"
4255,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The lone domain of Prospero; and, hark!"
4256,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Wild music, such as earth scarce seems to own,                   150"
4257,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],And Ariel o'er the slow-subsiding surge
4258,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Singing her smooth air quaintly! Such repose
4259,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Steals o'er her spirits, when, through storms at sea,"
4260,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Fancy has followed some nigh-foundered bark
4261,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Full many a league, in ocean's solitude"
4262,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Tossed far beyond the Cape of utmost Horn,"
4263,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],That stems the roaring deep; her dreary track
4264,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Still Fancy follows, and at dead of night"
4265,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Hears, with strange thunder, the huge fragments fall"
4266,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Crashing, from mountains of high-drifting ice                    160"
4267,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],That o'er her bows gleam fearful; till at last
4268,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],She hails the gallant ship in some still bay
4269,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Safe moored; or of delightful Tinian;
4270,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Smiling, like fairy isle, amid the waste;"
4271,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Or of New Zealand, where from sheltering rocks"
4272,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The clear cascades gush beautiful, and high"
4273,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The woodland scenery towers above the mast,"
4274,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Whose long and wavy ensign streams beneath.
4275,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Far inland, clad in snow, the mountains lift"
4276,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Their spiry summits, and endear the more                         170"
4277,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The sylvan scene around; the healing air
4278,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Breathes o'er green myrtles, and the poe-bird flits,"
4279,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Amid the shade of aromatic shrubs,"
4280,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],With silver neck and blue enamelled wing.
4281,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Now cross the stream, and up the narrow track,"
4282,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That winds along the mountain's edge, behold"
4283,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The peasant girl ascend: cheerful her look,"
4284,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Beneath the umbrage of her broad black hat,"
4285,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],And loose her dark-brown hair; the plodding pad
4286,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That bears her panting climbs, and with sure step                180"
4287,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Avoids the jutting fragments; she, meantime,"
4288,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Sits unconcerned, till, lessening from the view,"
4289,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],She gains the summit and is seen no more.
4290,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"All day, along that mountain's heathy waste,"
4291,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Booted and strapped, and in rough coat succinct,"
4292,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"His small shrill whistle pendent at his breast,"
4293,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With dogs and gun, untired the sportsman roams;"
4294,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Nor quits his wildly-devious range, till eve,"
4295,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Upon the woods, the rocks, and mazy rills"
4296,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Descending, warns him home: then he rejoins                      190"
4297,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The social circle, just as the clear moon,"
4298,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Emerging o'er the sable mountain, sails"
4299,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Silent, and calm, and beautiful, and sheds"
4300,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Its solemn grandeur on the shadowy scene.
4301,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],To music then; and let some chosen strain
4302,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Of HANDEL gently recreate the sense,"
4303,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],And give the silent heart to tender joy.
4304,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Pass on to the hoar cataract,[67] that foams"
4305,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Through the dark fissures of the riven rock;
4306,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Prone-rushing it descends, and with white whirl,                 200"
4307,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Save where some silent shady pool receives
4308,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Its dash; thence bursting, with collected sweep,"
4309,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And hollow sound, it hurries, till it falls"
4310,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Foaming in the wild stream that winds below.
4311,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Dark trees, that to the mountain's height ascend,"
4312,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"O'ershade with pendent boughs its mossy course,"
4313,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And, looking up, the eye beholds it flash"
4314,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Beneath the incumbent gloom, from ledge to ledge"
4315,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Shooting its silvery foam, and far within"
4316,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Wreathing its curve fantastic. If the harp                       210
4317,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Of deep poetic inspiration, struck"
4318,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"At times by the pale minstrel, whilst a strange"
4319,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And beauteous light filled his uplifted eye,"
4320,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Hath ever sounded into mortal ears,"
4321,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Here I might think I heard its tones, and saw,"
4322,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Sublime amidst the solitary scene,"
4323,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With dimly-gleaming harp, and snowy stole,"
4324,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And cheek in momentary frenzy flushed,"
4325,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The great musician stand. Hush, every wind"
4326,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That shakes the murmuring branches! and thou stream,             220"
4327,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Descending still with hollow-sounding sweep,"
4328,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Hush! 'Twas the bard struck the loud strings: Arise,"
4329,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Son of the magic song, arise!"
4330,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],And bid the deep-toned lyre
4331,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Pour forth its manly melodies.
4332,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With eyes on fire,"
4333,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],CARADOC rushed upon the foe;
4334,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],He reared his arm--he laid the mighty low!
4335,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],O'er the plain see him urge his gore-bathed steed!
4336,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"They bleed, the Romans[68] bleed!                            230"
4337,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"He lifts his lance on high,"
4338,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],They fly! the fierce invaders fly!
4339,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Fear not now the horse or spear,"
4340,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Fear not now the foeman's might;
4341,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Victory the cry shall hear
4342,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Of those who for their country fight;
4343,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],O'er the slain
4344,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That strew the plain,"
4345,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Stern on her sable war-horse shall she ride,"
4346,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And lift her red right hand, in their heart's blood deep dyed!   240"
4347,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Return, my Muse! the fearful sound is past;"
4348,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And now a little onward, where the way"
4349,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Ascends above the oaks that far below
4350,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Shade the rude steep, let Contemplation lead"
4351,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Our footsteps; from this shady eminence
4352,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],'Tis pleasant and yet fearful to look down
4353,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Upon the river roaring, and far off"
4354,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"To see it stretch in peace, and mark the rocks"
4355,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"One after one, in solemn majesty"
4356,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Unfolding their wild reaches; here with wood                     250
4357,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Mantled, beyond abrupt and bare, and each"
4358,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"As if it strove, with emulous disdain,"
4359,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"To tower in ruder, darker amplitude."
4360,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Pause, ere we enter the long craggy vale;"
4361,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],It seems the abode of Solitude. So high
4362,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The rock's bleak summit[69] frowns above our head,"
4363,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Looking immediate down, we almost fear"
4364,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Lest some enormous fragment should descend
4365,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With hideous sweep into the vale, and crush"
4366,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The intruding visitant. No sound is here,                        260"
4367,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Save of the stream that shrills, and now and then"
4368,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"A cry as of faint wailing, when the kite"
4369,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Comes sailing o'er the crags, or straggling lamb"
4370,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Bleats for its mother. Here, remote from man,"
4371,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And life's discordant roar, might Piety"
4372,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Lift up her early orisons to Him
4373,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Who made the world; who piled up, mighty rocks,"
4374,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Your huge o'ershadowing summits; who devolved
4375,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The mighty rivers on their mazy course;
4376,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Who bade the seasons roll, and they rolled on                    270"
4377,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"In harmony; who filled the earth with joy,"
4378,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],And spread it in magnificence. O GOD!
4379,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Thou also madest the great water-flood,"
4380,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The deep that uttereth thy voice; whose waves
4381,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Toss fearful at thy bidding. Thou didst speak,"
4382,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And lo! the great and glorious sun, from night"
4383,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Tenfold upspringing, through the heavens' wide way"
4384,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Held his untired career. These, in their course,"
4385,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"As with one shout of acclamation, praise"
4386,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Thee, LORD! thee, FATHER! thee, ALMIGHTY KING!                   280"
4387,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Maker of earth and heaven! Nor less the flower
4388,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That shakes its purple head, and smiles unseen"
4389,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Upon the mountain's van; nor less the stream
4390,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That tinkles through the cliff-encircled bourne,"
4391,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Cheering with music the lone place, proclaim:"
4392,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"In wisdom, Father, hast thou made them all!"
4393,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Scenes of retired sublimity, that fill"
4394,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],With fearful ecstasy and holy trance
4395,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The pausing mind! we leave your awful gloom,"
4396,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And lo! the footway plank, that leads across                     290"
4397,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The narrow torrent, foaming through the chasm"
4398,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Below; the rugged stones are washed and worn
4399,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Into a thousand shapes, and hollows scooped"
4400,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"By long attrition of the ceaseless surge,"
4401,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Smooth, deep, and polished as the marble urn,"
4402,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"In their hard forms. Here let us sit, and watch"
4403,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The struggling current burst its headlong way,"
4404,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Hearing the noise it makes, and musing much"
4405,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],On the strange changes of this nether world.
4406,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],How many ages must have swept to dust                            300
4407,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The still succeeding multitudes, that ""fret"
4408,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Their little hour"" upon this restless scene,"
4409,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Or ere the sweeping waters could have cut
4410,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The solid rock so deep! As now its roar
4411,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Comes hollow from below, methinks we hear"
4412,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The noise of generations, as they pass,"
4413,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"O'er the frail arch of earthly vanity,"
4414,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],To silence and oblivion. The loud coil
4415,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Ne'er ceases; as the running river sounds
4416,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"From age to age, though each particular wave                     310"
4417,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That made its brief noise, as it hurried on,"
4418,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Ev'n whilst we speak, is past, and heard no more;"
4419,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],So ever to the ear of Heaven ascends
4420,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The long, loud murmur of the rolling globe;"
4421,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Its strife, its toils, its sighs, its shouts, the same!"
4422,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"But lo! upon the hilly croft, and scarce"
4423,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Distinguished from the crags, the peasant hut"
4424,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],Forth peeping; nor unwelcome is the sight.
4425,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"It seems to say: Though solitude be sweet,"
4426,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],And sweet are all the images that float                          320
4427,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Like summer-clouds before the eye, and charm"
4428,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The pensive wanderer's way, 'tis sweeter yet"
4429,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],To think that in this world a brother lives.
4430,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And lovelier smiles the scene, that, 'mid the wilds"
4431,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Of rocks and mountains, the bemused thought"
4432,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Remembers of humanity, and calls"
4433,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The wildly-roving fancy back to life.
4434,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Here, then, I leave my harp, which I have touched"
4435,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"With careless hand, and here I bid farewell"
4436,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"To Fancy's fading pictures, and farewell                         330"
4437,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The ideal spirit that abides unseen
4438,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"'Mid rocks, and woods, and solitudes. I hail"
4439,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Rather the steps of Culture, that ascend"
4440,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The precipice's side. She bids the wild
4441,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Bloom, and adorns with beauty not its own"
4442,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The ridged mountain's tract; she speaks, and lo!"
4443,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],The yellow harvest nods upon the slope;
4444,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],And through the dark and matted moss upshoots
4445,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The bursting clover, smiling to the sun."
4446,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"These are thy offspring, Culture! the green herb                 340"
4447,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Is thine, that decks with rich luxuriance"
4448,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The pasture's lawny range; the yellow corn,"
4449,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"That waves upon the upland ridge, is thine;"
4450,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Thine too the elegant abode, that smiles"
4451,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Amidst the rocky scene, and wakes the thought,"
4452,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"The tender thought, of all life's charities."
4453,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And senseless were my heart, could I look back"
4454,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Upon the varied way my feet have trod,"
4455,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"Without a silent prayer that health and joy,"
4456,COOMBE-ELLEN.[66],"And love and happiness, may long abide                           350"

4521,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4522,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Stern Father of the storm! who dost abide
4523,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Amid the solitude of the vast deep,"
4524,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"For ever listening to the sullen tide,"
4525,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And whirlwinds that the billowy desert sweep!
4526,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Thou at the distant death-shriek dost rejoice;
4527,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The rule of the tempestuous main is thine,"
4528,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Outstretched and lone; thou utterest thy voice,"
4529,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Like solemn thunders: These wild waves are mine;
4530,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Mine their dread empire; nor shall man profane
4531,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The eternal secrets of my ancient reign.
4532,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4533,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The voice is vain: secure, and as in scorn,"
4534,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The gallant vessel scuds before the wind;
4535,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Her parting sails swell stately to the morn;
4536,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],She leaves the green earth and its hills behind;
4537,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Gallant before the wind she goes, her prow"
4538,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"High bearing, and disparting the blue tide"
4539,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],That foams and flashes in its rage below;
4540,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Meantime the helmsman feels a conscious pride,"
4541,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And while far onward the long billows swell,"
4542,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Looks to the lessening land, that seems to say, Farewell!"
4543,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4544,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Father of storms! then let thy whirlwinds roar
4545,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],O'er seas of solitary amplitude;
4546,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Man, the poor tenant of thy rocky shore,"
4547,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Man, thy terrific empire hath subdued;"
4548,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And though thy waves toss his high-foundered bark
4549,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Where no dim watch-light gleams, still he defies"
4550,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Thy utmost rage, and in his buoyant ark"
4551,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Speeds on, regardless of the darkening skies;"
4552,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And o'er the mountain-surges, as they roll,"
4553,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Subdues his destined way, and speeds from pole to pole."
4554,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4555,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Behold him now, far from his native plain,"
4556,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Where high woods shade some wild Hesperian bay,"
4557,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Or green isles glitter in the southern main,"
4558,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],His streaming ensign to the morn display!
4559,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Behold him, where the North's pale meteors dance,"
4560,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And icy rocks roll glimmering from afar,"
4561,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Fearless through night and solitude advance!
4562,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Or where the pining sons of Andamar,"
4563,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"When dark eclipse has wrapt the labouring moon,"
4564,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Howl to the demon of the dread monsoon!
4565,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4566,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Time was, like them, poor Nature's shivering child,"
4567,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Pacing the beach, and by the salt spray beat,"
4568,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"He watched the melancholy surge, or smiled"
4569,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],To see it burn and bicker at his feet;
4570,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"In some rude shaggy spot, by fortune placed,"
4571,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"He dreamed not of strange lands, and empires spread,"
4572,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Beyond the rolling of the watery waste;
4573,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"He saw the sun shine on the mountain's head,"
4574,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"But knew not, whilst he hailed the orient light,"
4575,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"What myriads blessed his beam, or sickened at the sight."
4576,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4577,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"From some dark promontory, that o'erbent"
4578,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The flashing waves, he heard their ceaseless roar;"
4579,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Or carolled in his light canoe content,"
4580,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"As, bound from creek to creek, it grazed the shore;"
4581,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Gods of the storm the dreary space might sweep,"
4582,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And shapes of death, and gliding spectres gaunt,"
4583,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Might flit, he thought, o'er the remoter deep;"
4584,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And whilst strange voices cried, Avaunt, avaunt!"
4585,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Uncertain lights, seen through the midnight gloom,"
4586,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Might lure him sadly on to his cold watery tomb.
4587,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4588,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"No city, then, amid the calm clear day,"
4589,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"O'er the blue waters' undulating line,"
4590,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"With battlements, and fans that glittered gay,"
4591,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And piers, and thronging masts, was seen to shine."
4592,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"No cheerful sounds were wafted on the gale,"
4593,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Nor hummed the shores with early industry;
4594,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"But mournful birds in hollow cliffs did wail,"
4595,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And there all day the cormorant did cry,"
4596,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"While with sunk eye, and matted, dripping locks,"
4597,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The houseless savage slept beneath the foam-beat rocks.
4598,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4599,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Thus slumbering long upon the dreamy verge
4600,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Of instinct, see, he rouses from his trance!"
4601,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Faint, and as glimmering yet, the Arts emerge,"
4602,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"One after one, from darkness, and advance,"
4603,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Beauteous, as o'er the heavens the stars' still way."
4604,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Now see the track of his dominion wide,"
4605,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Fair smiling as the dayspring; cities gay
4606,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Lift their proud heads, and o'er the yellow tide,"
4607,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Whilst sounds of fervent industry arise,"
4608,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],A thousand pennants float bright streaming in the skies!
4609,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4610,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Genius of injured Asia! once sublime
4611,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And glorious, now dim seen amid the storm,"
4612,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And melancholy clouds of sweeping time,"
4613,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Who yet dost half reveal thine awful form,"
4614,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Pointing, with saddened aspect and slow hand,"
4615,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"To vast emporiums, desolate and waste;"
4616,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"To wrecks of unknown cities, sunk in sand!"
4617,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"'Twas at thy voice, Arts, Order, Science, Taste."
4618,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Upsprung, the East adorning, like the smile"
4619,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Of Spring upon the banks of thy own swelling Nile.
4620,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4621,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"'Twas at thy voice huge Enterprise awoke,"
4622,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"That, long on rocky Aradus reclined,"
4623,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Slumbered to the hoarse surge that round her broke,"
4624,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And hollow pipings of the idle wind;
4625,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"She heard thy voice, upon the rock she stood"
4626,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Gigantic, the rude scene she marked--she cried,"
4627,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Let there be intercourse, and the great flood"
4628,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Waft the rich plenty to these shores denied!
4629,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And soon thine eye delighted saw aspire,"
4630,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Crowning the midland main, thy own Imperial Tyre."
4631,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4632,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Queen of the waters! who didst ope the gate
4633,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Of Commerce, and display in lands unknown"
4634,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Thy venturous sail, ev'n now in ancient state"
4635,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Methinks I see thee on thy rocky throne;
4636,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"I see their massy piles thy cothons[71] rear,"
4637,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And on the deep a solemn shadow cast;
4638,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"I traverse thy once echoing shores, and hear"
4639,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The sound of mighty generations past:
4640,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"I see thy kingly merchants' thronged resort,"
4641,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And gold and purple gleam o'er all thy spacious port.
4642,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4643,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],I mark thy glittering galleys sweep along--
4644,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The steady rowers to the strokes incline,"
4645,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And chaunt in unison their choral song;
4646,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],White through their oars the ivory benches shine;
4647,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The fine-wrought sails, which looms of Egypt wove,"
4648,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Swell beautiful beneath the bending mast;
4649,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Hewn from proud Lebanon's immortal grove,"
4650,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The oaks of Bashan brave the roaring blast!
4651,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"So o'er the western wave thy vessels float,"
4652,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"For verdant Egypt bound, or Calpe's cliffs remote."
4653,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4654,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Queen of the waters! throned upon thy seat
4655,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Amid the sea, thy beauty and thy fame"
4656,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The deep, that rolls low-murmuring at thy feet,"
4657,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And all the multitude of isles, proclaim!"
4658,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],For thee Damascus piles her woolly store;
4659,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],To thee their flocks Arabia's princes bring;
4660,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And Sheba heaps her spice and glittering ore;
4661,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The ships of Tarshish of thy glory sing:[72]
4662,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Queen of the waters! who is like to thee,"
4663,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Replenished in thy might, and throned on the sea!"
4664,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4665,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The purple streamers fly, the trumpets sound,"
4666,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The adventurous bark glides on in tranquil state;
4667,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"The voyagers, with leafy garlands crowned,"
4668,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Draw back their arms together, and elate"
4669,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Sweep o'er the surge; the spray far scattered flies
4670,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Beneath the stroke of their unwearied oars;
4671,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],To their loud shouts the circling coast replies;
4672,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And now, o'er the deep ocean, where it roars"
4673,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"They fly; till slowly lessening from the shore,"

4681,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],(Amid the brazen cymbal's hollow ring)
4682,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],And aged priests the solemn feast prepare;
4683,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],To her their nightly orisons they sing;
4684,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"That she may look from her high throne, and guide"
4685,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The wandering bark secure along the trackless tide.
4686,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4687,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Her on his nightly watch the pilot views
4688,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Careful, and by her soft and tranquil light,"
4689,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Along the uncertain coast his track pursues;
4690,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"And now he sees great Carmel's woody height,"
4691,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Where nightly fires to grisly Baal burn;
4692,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Round the rough cape he winds; meantime far on
4693,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Thick eddying scuds the hollow surf upturn;
4694,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],He thinks of the sweet light of summer gone!
4695,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"He thinks, perhaps, dashed on the rugged shore,"
4696,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],He never shall behold his babes' loved mother more!
4697,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4698,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Slow comes the morn; but ah! what demon form,[74]"

4701,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],With dreadful shade his horrid bulk ascends
4702,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Dark to the driving clouds; beneath him roars
4703,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The deep; his troubled brow is wrapped in gloom;
4704,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"See, it moves onwards; now more huge it soars!"
4705,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Who shall avert the poor seafarer's doom!
4706,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Who now shall save him from the spectre's might

4715,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Behold, they shrink, they bend with speechless dread;"
4716,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],From their faint grasp drops the unheeded oar!
4717,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"It answers not, but mingling seas and sky,"
4718,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"In clouds, and wind, and thunder, rushes by."
4719,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],
4720,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Hail to thy light, lord of the golden day,"

4726,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],"Fringing the sunny sea-line, clear and calm;"
4727,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Now hark the slowly-swelling human sounds!
4728,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Meantime the bark along the placid bay
4729,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Of Tamiatis keeps her easy-winding way.
4730,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],

4736,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Here citrons tall and purple dates around
4737,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],Delicious fragrance and cool shade bestow;
4738,THE SPIRIT OF NAVIGATION.[70],The shores with murmuring industry resound;

6081,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Shall show the banks, the woods, the hill,"
6082,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"More clear, more beautiful, more still."
6083,THE VISIONARY BOY.,For him more musical shall wave
6084,THE VISIONARY BOY.,The pines o'er Echo's moonlit cave;                             40
6085,THE VISIONARY BOY.,While sounds as of a fairy lyre
6086,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Amid the shadowy cliffs expire!
6087,THE VISIONARY BOY.,This valley where the raptured minstrel stood
6088,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Was shaded with a circling slope of wood,"
6089,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And rich in beauty, with that valley vied,"
6090,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Thessalian Tempe, crowned with verdant bay,"
6091,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Where smooth and clear Peneus winds his way;
6092,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And Ossa and Olympus, on each side,"
6093,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Rise dark with woods; or that Sicilian plain
6094,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Which Arethusa's clearest waters lave,                          50"
6095,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"By many a haunt of Pan, and wood-nymph's cave,"
6096,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Lingering and listening to the Doric strain
6097,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Of him,[100] the bard whose music might succeed"
6098,THE VISIONARY BOY.,To the wild melodies of Pan's own reed!
6099,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"This scene the mistress of the valley held,"
6100,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Fancy, a magic maid; and at her will,"
6101,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"AÎrial castles crowned the gleaming hill,"
6102,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Or forests rose, or lapse of water welled."
6103,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Sometimes she sat with lifted eye,"
6104,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And marked the dark storm in the western sky;                     60
6105,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Sometimes she looked, and scarce her breath would draw,"
6106,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"As fearful things, not to be told, she saw;"
6107,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And sometimes, like a vision of the air,"
6108,THE VISIONARY BOY.,On wings of shifting light she floated here and there.
6109,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"In the breeze her garments flew,"
6110,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Of the brightest skiey blue,"
6111,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Lucid as the tints of morn,"
6112,THE VISIONARY BOY.,When Summer trills his pipe of corn:
6113,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Her tresses to each wing descending fall,"
6114,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Or, lifted by the wind,                                     70"
6115,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Stream loose and unconfined,"
6116,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Like golden threads, beneath her myrtle coronal."
6117,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The listening passions stood aloof and mute,"
6118,THE VISIONARY BOY.,As oft the west wind touched her trembling lute.
6119,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"But when its sounds the youthful minstrel heard,"
6120,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Strange mingled feelings, not to be expressed,"
6121,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Rose undefined, yet blissful, on his breast,"
6122,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And all the softened scene in sweeter light appeared.
6123,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Then Fancy waved her wand, and lo!"
6124,THE VISIONARY BOY.,An airy troop went beckoning by:                                  80
6125,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Come, from toil and worldly woe;"
6126,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Come, live with us in vales remote! they cry."
6127,THE VISIONARY BOY.,These are the flitting phantasies; the dreams
6128,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"That lead the heart through all that elfin land,"
6129,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Where half-seen shapes entice with whispers bland.
6130,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Meantime the clouds, impressed with livelier beams,"
6131,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Roll, in the lucid track of air,"
6132,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Arrayed in coloured brede, with semblances more fair."
6133,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The airy troop, as on they sail,"
6134,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Thus the pensive stranger hail:                                 90
6135,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"In the pure and argent sky,"
6136,THE VISIONARY BOY.,There our distant chambers lie;
6137,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The bed is strewed with blushing roses,"
6138,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"When Quietude at eve reposes,"
6139,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Oft trembling lest her bowers should fade,"
6140,THE VISIONARY BOY.,In the cold earth's humid shade.
6141,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Come, rest with us! evanishing, they cried--"
6142,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Come, rest with us! the lonely vale replied."
6143,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Then Fancy beckoned, and with smiling mien,"
6144,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"A radiant form arose, like the fair Queen                        100"
6145,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Of Beauty: from her eye divinely bright,"
6146,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"A richer lustre shot, a more attractive light."
6147,THE VISIONARY BOY.,She said: With fairer tints I can adorn
6148,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The living landscape, fairer than the morn."
6149,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The summer clouds in shapes romantic rolled,"
6150,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And those they edge the fading west, like gold;"
6151,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The lake that sleeps in sunlight, yet impressed"
6152,THE VISIONARY BOY.,With shades more sweet than real on its breast;
6153,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"'Mid baffling stones, beneath a partial ray,"
6154,THE VISIONARY BOY.,The small brook huddling its uneven way;                         110
6155,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The blue far distant hills, the silvery sea,"
6156,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And every scene of summer speaks of me:
6157,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"But most I wake the sweetest wishes warm,"
6158,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Where the fond gaze is turned on woman's breathing form.
6159,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"So passing silent through a myrtle grove,"
6160,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Beauty first led him to the bower of Love.
6161,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"A mellow light through the dim covert strayed,"
6162,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And opening roses canopied the shade.
6163,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Why does the hurrying pulse unbidden leap!
6164,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Behold, in yonder glade that nymph asleep!                       120"
6165,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The heart-struck minstrel hangs, with lingering gaze,"
6166,THE VISIONARY BOY.,O'er every charm his eye impassioned strays!
6167,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"An edge of white is seen, and scarcely seen,"
6168,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"As soft she breathes, her coral lips between;"
6169,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"A lambent ray steals from her half-closed eye,"
6170,THE VISIONARY BOY.,As her breast heaves a short imperfect sigh.
6171,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Sleep, winds of summer, o'er the leafy bower,"
6172,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Nor move the light bells of the nodding flower;
6173,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Lest but a sound of stirring leaves might seem
6174,THE VISIONARY BOY.,To break the charm of her delicious dream!                       130
6175,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And ye, fond, rising, throbbing thoughts, away,"
6176,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Lest syren Pleasure all the soul betray!
6177,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Oh! turn, and listen to the ditty"
6178,THE VISIONARY BOY.,From the lowly cave of Pity.
6179,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"On slaughter's plain, while Valour grieves,"
6180,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"There he sunk to rest,"
6181,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And the ring-dove scattered leaves
6182,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Upon his bleeding breast!
6183,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Her face was hid, while her pale arms enfold"
6184,THE VISIONARY BOY.,What seemed an urn of alabaster cold;                            140
6185,THE VISIONARY BOY.,To this she pressed her heaving bosom bare:
6186,THE VISIONARY BOY.,The drops that gathered in the dank abode
6187,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Fell dripping, on her long dishevelled hair;"
6188,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And still her tears, renewed, and silent, flowed:"
6189,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And when the winds of autumn ceased to swell,"
6190,THE VISIONARY BOY.,At times was heard a slow and melancholy knell!
6191,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"'Twas in the twilight of the deepest wood,"
6192,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Beneath whose boughs like sad Cocytus, famed"
6193,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Through fabling Greece, from lamentation named[101]"
6194,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"A river dark and silent flowed, there stood                      150"
6195,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"A pale and melancholy man, intent"
6196,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"His look upon that drowsy stream he bent,"
6197,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"As ever counting, when the fitful breeze"
6198,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"With strange and hollow sound sung through the trees,"
6199,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Counting the sallow leaves, that down the current went."
6200,THE VISIONARY BOY.,He saw them not:
6201,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Earth seemed to him one universal blot.
6202,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Sometimes, as most distempered, to and fro"
6203,THE VISIONARY BOY.,He paced; and sometimes fixed his chilling look
6204,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Upon a dreadful book,                                          160"
6205,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Inscribed with secret characters of woe;
6206,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"While gibbering imps, as mocking him, appeared,"
6207,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And airy laughter 'mid the dusk was heard.
6208,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Then Fancy waved her wand again,"
6209,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And all that valley that so lovely smiled
6210,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Was changed to a bare champaign, waste and wild."
6211,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"""What pale and phantom-horseman rides amain?"""
6212,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"'Tis Terror;--all the plain, far on, is spread"
6213,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"With skulls and bones, and relics of the dead!"
6214,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"From his black trump he blew a louder blast,                     170"
6215,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And earthquakes muttered as the giant passed.
6216,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Then said that magic maid, with aspect bland,"
6217,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"'Tis thine to seize his phantom spear,"
6218,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"'Tis thine his sable trumpet to command,"
6219,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And thrill the inmost heart with shuddering fear.
6220,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"But hark! to Music's softer sound,"
6221,THE VISIONARY BOY.,New scenes and fairer views accordant rise:
6222,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Above, around,"
6223,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The mingled measure swells in air, and dies."
6224,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Music, in thy charmed shell,                                     180"
6225,THE VISIONARY BOY.,What sounds of holy magic dwell!
6226,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Oft when that shell was to the ear applied,"
6227,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Confusion of rich harmonies,"
6228,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"All swelling rose,"
6229,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"That came, as with a gently-swelling tide:"
6230,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Then at the close,"
6231,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Angelic voices seemed, aloft,"
6232,THE VISIONARY BOY.,To answer as it died the cadence soft.
6233,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Now, like the hum of distant ocean's stream,"
6234,THE VISIONARY BOY.,The murmurs of the wond'rous concave seem;                       190
6235,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And now exultingly their tones prolong
6236,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The chorded pÊans of the choral song,"
6237,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Then Music, with a voice more wildly sweet"
6238,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Than winds that pipe on the forsaken shore,"
6239,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"When the last rain-drops of the west are o'er,"
6240,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Warbled: Oh, welcome to my blest retreat,"
6241,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And give my sounds to the responsive lyre:
6242,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"With me to these melodious groves retire,"
6243,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And such pure feelings share,"
6244,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"As, far from noise and folly, soothe thee there.                 200"
6245,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Here Fancy, as the prize were won,"
6246,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And now she hailed her favourite son,"
6247,THE VISIONARY BOY.,With energy impatient cried:
6248,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"The weary world is dark and wide,"
6249,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Lo! I am with thee still to comfort and to guide.[102]
6250,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Nor fear, if, grim before thine eyes,"

6256,THE VISIONARY BOY.,When that heart no more shall bound
6257,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"At some kind voice's well-known sound,"
6258,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"My spells thy drooping languor shall relieve,"
6259,THE VISIONARY BOY.,And airy spirits touch thy lonely harp at eve.
6260,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Look!--Delight and Hope advancing,"

6265,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Waving light his seraph wings,"
6266,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Youth exulting flies before them,"
6267,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Scattering cowslips as he sings!
6268,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Come now, my car pursue,"
6269,THE VISIONARY BOY.,The wayward Fairy cried;
6270,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And high amid the fields of air,"
6271,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Above the clouds, together we will ride,"
6272,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"And posting on the viewless winds,"
6273,THE VISIONARY BOY.,So leave the cares of earth and all its thoughts behind.

6275,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"To all regions of the sky,"
6276,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"On the shooting meteor's course,"
6277,THE VISIONARY BOY.,On a winged griffin-horse!
6278,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"She spoke: when Wisdom's self drew nigh,"
6279,THE VISIONARY BOY.,A noble sternness in her searching eye;
6280,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Like Pallas helmed, and in her hand a spear,"
6281,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"As not in idle warfare bent, but still,"
6282,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"As resolute, to cope with every earthly ill."
6283,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"In youthful dignity severe,"
6284,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"She stood: And shall the aspiring mind,                          240"
6285,THE VISIONARY BOY.,To Fancy be alone resigned!
6286,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Alas! she cried, her witching lay"
6287,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Too often leads the heart astray!
6288,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Still, weak minstrel, wouldst thou rove,"
6289,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Drooping in the distant grove,"
6290,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Forgetful of all ties that bind
6291,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Thee, a brother, to mankind?"
6292,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Has Fancy's feeble voice defied
6293,THE VISIONARY BOY.,The ills to poor humanity allied?
6294,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Can she, like Wisdom, bid thy soul sustain                       250"

6301,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Each sweet illusion nourished there.
6302,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"With dignity and truth, combined,"
6303,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Still may she rule the manly mind;
6304,THE VISIONARY BOY.,Her sweetest magic still impart                                  260
6305,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"To soften, not subdue, the heart:"
6306,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Still may she warm the chosen breast,"

6348,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Beneath her feet; she bids an eagle fly,"
6349,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Breasting the whirlwind, through the dark-red sky;"
6350,THE VISIONARY BOY.,"Or, with elated look, lifts high the spear,"

7189,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Brave Hoel's ruddy hue,"
7190,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],But soon the moment's thought is past:--
7191,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Hark, hark, 'tis the trumpet's stirring blast!"
7192,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],And he grasped his bow of yew.
7193,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],

7197,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"I follow thee, be it my doom,"
7198,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"O CHRIST, to live or die!"
7199,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7200,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"No more he thought, though rich in fee,                           12"
7201,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Of any earthly loss,"
7202,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"But lighting, on his bended knee,"
7203,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Said, Father, here I take from thee"
7204,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],The sign of the Holy Cross.

7209,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Which soon he dried, of love sincere,"
7210,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],On his stern eyelid stood);

7219,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],To the field of death I go;
7220,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Welcome the trumpet's blast, the neigh"
7221,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Of my bold and barbed steed of gray,"
7222,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],And the clang of the steel crossbow!
7223,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7224,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Gwenlhian sat in the hall at night,                               16"
7225,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],Counting the heavy hours;
7226,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"She saw the moon, with tranquil light,"
7227,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Shine on the circling mountain's height,"

7231,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],When she heard a bugle blow;
7232,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"A trump from the watch-tower answered then,"
7233,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"And the tramp of steeds, and the voice of men,"
7234,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],Were heard in the court below.
7235,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7236,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"The watch-dog started at the noise,                               18"
7237,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],Then crouched at his master's feet;
7238,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"He knew his step, he heard his voice;"
7239,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"But who can now like her rejoice,"
7240,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],Who flies her own lord to greet?
7241,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7242,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],And soon her arms his neck enfold:                                19
7243,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],But whence that altered mien!
7244,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"O say, then, is thy love grown cold,"
7245,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Or hast thou been hurt by the robbers bold,"
7246,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],That won in the forest of Dean?
7247,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7248,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Oh no, he cried, the God above,                                   20"
7249,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Who all my soul can see,"
7250,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Knows my sincere, my fervent love;"
7251,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"If aught my stern resolve could move,"
7252,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],It were one tear from thee.
7253,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7254,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"But I have sworn, in the Holy Land,--                             21"
7255,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],Need I the sequel speak;
7256,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Too well, she cried, I understand!"
7257,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Then grasped in agony his hand,"
7258,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],And hid her face on his cheek.
7259,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7260,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"My loved Gwenlhian, weep not so,                                  22"
7261,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],From the lid that tear I kiss;
7262,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Though to the wars far off I go,"
7263,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Betide me weal, betide me woe,"
7264,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],We yet may meet in bliss.
7265,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7266,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Fourteen suns their course had rolled,                            23"
7267,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],When firmly thus he spake;
7268,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],Hear now my last request: behold
7269,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"This ring, it is of purest gold,"
7270,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Love, keep it for my sake!"
7271,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7272,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"When summers seven have robed each tree,                          24"
7273,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"And clothed the vales with green,"
7274,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"If I come not back, then thou art free,"
7275,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"To wed or not, and to think of me,"
7276,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],As I had never been!
7277,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],
7278,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Nay, answer not,--what wouldst thou say!"
7279,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Come, let my harp be brought;"
7280,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"For the last time, I fain would play,"
7281,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],"Ere yet we part, our favourite lay,"
7282,THE HARP OF HOEL.[132],And cheat severer thought:

7452,PART II.,"In beauty's train she yet might vie,                              18"

7476,PART II.,With converse mild he oft would seek                              22
7477,PART II.,To sooth her sense of care;
7478,PART II.,"As the west wind, with breathings weak,"

7480,PART II.,A smile of faint despair.

7950,INTRODUCTION.[152],"I need not perhaps inform the reader, that I had before written a Canto"
7951,INTRODUCTION.[152],"on the subject of this poem; but I was dissatisfied with the metre, and"
7952,INTRODUCTION.[152],felt the necessity of some connecting idea that might give it a degree
7953,INTRODUCTION.[152],of unity and coherence.
7954,INTRODUCTION.[152],
7955,INTRODUCTION.[152],This difficulty I considered as almost inseparable from the subject; I
7956,INTRODUCTION.[152],"therefore relinquished the design of making an extended poem on events,"
7957,INTRODUCTION.[152],"which, though highly interesting and poetical, were too unconnected with"
7958,INTRODUCTION.[152],each other to unite properly in one regular whole. But on being kindly
7959,INTRODUCTION.[152],permitted to peruse the sheets of Mr Clarke's valuable work on the
7960,INTRODUCTION.[152],"_History of Navigation_, I conceived (without supposing _historically_"
7961,INTRODUCTION.[152],with him that all ideas of navigation were derived from the ark of Noah)
7962,INTRODUCTION.[152],"that I might adopt the circumstance _poetically_, as capable of"
7963,INTRODUCTION.[152],"furnishing an unity of design; besides which, it had the advantage of"
7964,INTRODUCTION.[152],giving a more serious cast and character to the whole.

7981,INTRODUCTION.[152],supposed that he did. There are other circumstances for which I may have
7982,INTRODUCTION.[152],"less reason to expect pardon. The Egyptians were never, or but for a"
7983,INTRODUCTION.[152],"short time, a maritime nation. In answer to this, I must say, that"
7984,INTRODUCTION.[152],_history_ and _poetry_ are two things; and though the poet has no right
7985,INTRODUCTION.[152],"to _contradict_ the historian, yet, if he find two opinions upon points"
7986,INTRODUCTION.[152],"of history, he may certainly take that which is most susceptible of"

7994,INTRODUCTION.[152],"Herodotus, in its favour. In making the ships of Ammon first pass the"

7997,INTRODUCTION.[152],"obscure; the poet, however, has a right to build upon them, whilst what"
7998,INTRODUCTION.[152],he advances is not in _direct contradiction_ to all historical admitted
7999,INTRODUCTION.[152],"facts. He may take what is _shadowy_, if it be _plausible_, poetical,"
8000,INTRODUCTION.[152],"and coherent with his general plan. Having said ingenuously thus much, I"
8001,INTRODUCTION.[152],"hope I shall not be severely accused for having admitted, _en passant_,"

8048,BOOK THE FIRST.,immediately after the flood. The poem returns to the situation of our
8049,BOOK THE FIRST.,forefathers on leaving the ark; beautiful evening described. The Angel
8050,BOOK THE FIRST.,"of Destruction appears to Noah in a dream, and informs him that although"

8129,BOOK THE THIRD,"the world, _miraculously preserved by an ark_; the further march of the"
8130,BOOK THE THIRD,conqueror towards the holy spot is deprecated: his best glory shall be

8132,BOOK THE THIRD,"Alexander is animated with the idea; and his fleet, under Nearchus,"

8142,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"pointed out by the sagacity of Alexander, but that a wider scene, beyond"
8143,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"THE ANCIENT WORLD, opens to the VIEW OF DISCOVERY. The use of the magnet"
8144,BOOK THE FOURTH.,is discovered; and Henry of Portugal prosecutes the plan of opening a
8145,BOOK THE FOURTH.,passage along the coast of Africa to the East. One of his ships on its
8146,BOOK THE FOURTH.,return from the expedition has been driven from Cape Bojador (the
8147,BOOK THE FOURTH.,formidable boundary of Portuguese research) by a storm at sea. The isle
8148,BOOK THE FOURTH.,afterwards called Porto Santo is discovered. The circumstance related;
8149,BOOK THE FOURTH.,but the extraordinary appearance of a supernatural shade over the waters
8150,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"at a distance excites many fears and superstitions. The attempt,"
8151,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"however, to penetrate the mystery, is resolved on. Zarco reaches the"
8152,BOOK THE FOURTH.,island of Madeira; tomb found; which introduces the episode. At the tomb
8153,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"of the first discoverer (whether this be fanciful or not, is nothing to"
8154,BOOK THE FOURTH.,poetry) the Spirit of Discovery casts her eyes over the globe; she
8155,BOOK THE FOURTH.,pursues De Gama to the East; history of Camoens touched on; Columbus;
8156,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"sees with triumph the discovery of a new world, and from thence extends"
8157,BOOK THE FOURTH.,her ideas till the great globe is encompassed; after which she returns
8158,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"to the ""tranquil bosom of the Thames,"" with Drake, the first"
8159,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"circumnavigator, whose ship, after its various perils, being laid up in"

8165,BOOK THE FIFTH.,Hitherto we have described only the triumphs of Discovery; but it
8166,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"appears necessary that many incidental evils, special and general,"
8167,BOOK THE FIFTH.,should be mentioned. Fate and miserable end of some great
8168,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"commanders,--of our gallant and benevolent countryman, Cook. After the"
8169,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"natural feelings of regret, the mind is led to contemplate the great"
8170,BOOK THE FIFTH.,advantages of his voyages: the health of seamen; the accessions to
8171,BOOK THE FIFTH.,geographical knowledge; the spirit of humanity and science; his
8172,BOOK THE FIFTH.,exploring the east part of New-Holland; and being the first to determine
8173,BOOK THE FIFTH.,the proximity of America to Asia. This circumstance leads us back from
8174,BOOK THE FIFTH.,the point whence we set out--THE ARK OF NOAH; and hence we are partly
8175,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"enabled to solve, what has been for so many ages unknown, the"
8176,BOOK THE FIFTH.,difficulty{g} respecting the earth's being peopled from one family.

8178,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"The poem having thus gained a middle and end, the conclusion of the"

8180,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"DISCOVERY cleared up, so all the apparent contradictions in the moral"
8181,BOOK THE FIFTH.,world shall be reconciled. We have yet many existing evils to deplore;
8182,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"but when the SUPREME DISPOSER's plan shall have been completed, then the"
8183,BOOK THE FIFTH.,"earth, which has been explored and enlightened by discovery and"

8293,BOOK THE FIRST.,From morn till eve; save in that spot that holds
8294,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The sacred Ark: there the glad sounds ascend,"
8295,BOOK THE FIRST.,And Nature listens to the breath of Life.
8296,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The fleet horse bounds, high-neighing to the wind"

8300,BOOK THE FIRST.,He kneels upon the earth--he kisses it;

8349,BOOK THE FIRST.,"That to the west slopes his untired career,"

8379,BOOK THE FIRST.,Faint echoes; stilly sound the distant streams.
8380,BOOK THE FIRST.,"When, hark! a strange and mingled wail, and cries"

8382,BOOK THE FIRST.,"A phantom, 'mid the shadows of the dead,"
8383,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Before the holy Patriarch, as he slept,"

8391,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Before it swept the living multitudes,"
8392,BOOK THE FIRST.,I rode amid the hurricane; I heard
8393,BOOK THE FIRST.,The universal shriek of all that lived.
8394,BOOK THE FIRST.,In vain they climbed the rocky heights: I struck
8395,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The adamantine mountains, and like dust"
8396,BOOK THE FIRST.,"They crumbled in the billowy foam. My hall,"
8397,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Deep in the centre of the seas, received"

8399,BOOK THE FIRST.,"I sat amid ten thousand carcases,"
8400,BOOK THE FIRST.,That weltered at my feet! But THOU and THINE

8402,BOOK THE FIRST.,"But vengeance, vengeance on thy hated race;--"
8403,BOOK THE FIRST.,And be that sheltering shrine the instrument!
8404,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Thence, taught to stem the wild sea when it roars,"
8405,BOOK THE FIRST.,"In after-times to lands remote, where roamed"
8406,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The naked man and his wan progeny,"
8407,BOOK THE FIRST.,"They, more instructed in the fatal use"
8408,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of arts and arms, shall ply their way; and thou                  200"
8409,BOOK THE FIRST.,Wouldst bid the great deep cover thee to see
8410,BOOK THE FIRST.,The sorrows of thy miserable sons:
8411,BOOK THE FIRST.,"But turn, and view in part the truths I speak."
8412,BOOK THE FIRST.,"He said, and vanished with a dismal sound"
8413,BOOK THE FIRST.,Of lamentation from his grisly troop.
8414,BOOK THE FIRST.,Then saw the just man in his dream what seemed
8415,BOOK THE FIRST.,A new and savage land: huge forests stretched
8416,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Their world of wood, shading like night the banks"
8417,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of torrent-foaming rivers, many a league"
8418,BOOK THE FIRST.,Wandering and lost in solitudes; green isles                     210
8419,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Here shone, and scattered huts beneath the shade"
8420,BOOK THE FIRST.,Of branching palms were seen; whilst in the sun
8421,BOOK THE FIRST.,"A naked infant playing, stretched his hand"
8422,BOOK THE FIRST.,"To reach a speckled snake, that through the leaves"
8423,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Oft darted, or its shining volumes rolled"
8424,BOOK THE FIRST.,Erratic.
8425,BOOK THE FIRST.,From the woods a sable man
8426,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Came, as from hunting; in his arms he took"
8427,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The smiling child, that with the feathers played"
8428,BOOK THE FIRST.,Which nodded on his brow; the sheltering hut                     220
8429,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Received them, and the cheerful smoke went up"
8430,BOOK THE FIRST.,Above the silent woods.
8431,BOOK THE FIRST.,Anon was heard
8432,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The sound as of strange thunder, from the mouths"
8433,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of hollow engines, as, with white sails spread,"
8434,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Tall vessels, hulled like the great Ark, approached"
8435,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The verdant shores: they, in a woody cove"
8436,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Safe-stationed, hang their pennants motionless"
8437,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Beneath the palms. Meantime, with shouts and song,"
8438,BOOK THE FIRST.,The boat rows hurrying to the land; nor long                     230
8439,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Ere the great sea for many a league is tinged,"
8440,BOOK THE FIRST.,"While corpse on corpse, down the red torrent rolled,[156]"
8441,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Floats, and the inmost forests murmur--Blood."
8442,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Now vast savannahs meet the view, where high"
8443,BOOK THE FIRST.,Above the arid grass the serpent lifts
8444,BOOK THE FIRST.,His tawny crest:--Not far a vessel rides
8445,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Upon the sunny main, and to the shore"
8446,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Black savage tribes a mournful captive urge,"
8447,BOOK THE FIRST.,Who looks to heaven with anguish. Him they cast
8448,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Bound in the rank hold of the prison-ship,                       240"
8449,BOOK THE FIRST.,"With many a sad associate in despair,"
8450,BOOK THE FIRST.,Each panting chained to his allotted space;
8451,BOOK THE FIRST.,"And moaning, whilst their wasted eye-balls roll."
8452,BOOK THE FIRST.,Another scene appears: the naked slave
8453,BOOK THE FIRST.,Writhes to the bloody lash; but more to view
8454,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Nature forbad, for starting from his dream"
8455,BOOK THE FIRST.,The just Man woke. Shuddering he gazed around;
8456,BOOK THE FIRST.,He saw the earliest beam of morning shine
8457,BOOK THE FIRST.,Slant on the hills without; he heard the breath
8458,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of placid kine, but troubled thoughts and sad                    250"
8459,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Arose. He wandered forth; and now far on,"
8460,BOOK THE FIRST.,"By heavy musings led, reached a ravine"
8461,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Most mild amid the tempest-riven rocks,"
8462,BOOK THE FIRST.,Through whose dark pass he saw the flood remote
8463,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Gray-spreading, while the mists of morn went up."
8464,BOOK THE FIRST.,He paused; when on his lonely pathway flashed
8465,BOOK THE FIRST.,"A light, and sounds as of approaching wings"
8466,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Instant were heard. A radiant form appeared,"
8467,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Celestial, and with heavenly accent said:"
8468,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Noah, I come commissioned from above,                            260"
8469,BOOK THE FIRST.,Where angels move before th' eternal throne
8470,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of heaven's great King in glory, to dispel"
8471,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The mists of darkness from thy sight; for know,"
8472,BOOK THE FIRST.,Not unpermitted of th' Eternal One
8473,BOOK THE FIRST.,The shadows of thy melancholy dream
8474,BOOK THE FIRST.,Hung o'er thee slumbering: Mine the task to show
8475,BOOK THE FIRST.,Futurity's faint scene;--now follow me.
8476,BOOK THE FIRST.,He said; and up to the unclouded height
8477,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of that great Eastern mountain,[157] that surveys"
8478,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Dim Asia, they ascended. Then his brow                           270"
8479,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The Angel touched, and cleared with whispered charm"
8480,BOOK THE FIRST.,The mortal mist before his eyes.--At once
8481,BOOK THE FIRST.,"(As in the skiey mirage, when the seer"
8482,BOOK THE FIRST.,From lonely Kilda's western summit sees
8483,BOOK THE FIRST.,A wondrous scene in shadowy vision rise)
8484,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The NETHER WORLD, with seas and shores, appeared"
8485,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Submitted to his view: but not as then,"
8486,BOOK THE FIRST.,"A melancholy waste, deform and sad;"
8487,BOOK THE FIRST.,"But fair as now the green earth spreads, with woods,"
8488,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Champaign, and hills, and many winding streams                   280"
8489,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Robed, the magnificent illusion rose."
8490,BOOK THE FIRST.,He saw in mazy longitude devolved
8491,BOOK THE FIRST.,The mighty Brahma-Pooter; to the East
8492,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Thibet and China, and the shining sea"
8493,BOOK THE FIRST.,"That sweeps the inlets of Japan, and winds"
8494,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Amid the Curile and Aleutian isles,"
8495,BOOK THE FIRST.,Pale to the north. Siberia's snowy scenes
8496,BOOK THE FIRST.,Are spread; Jenisca and the freezing Ob
8497,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Appear, and many a forest's shady track"
8498,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Far as the Baltic, and the utmost bounds                         290"
8499,BOOK THE FIRST.,Of Scandinavia; thence the eye returns:
8500,BOOK THE FIRST.,And lo! great Lebanon--abrupt and dark
8501,BOOK THE FIRST.,"With pines, and airy Carmel, rising slow"
8502,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Above the midland main, where hang the capes"
8503,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of Italy and Greece; swart Africa,"
8504,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Beneath the parching sun, her long domain"
8505,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Reveals, the mountains of the Moon, the source"
8506,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of Nile, the wild mysterious Niger, lost"
8507,BOOK THE FIRST.,Amid the torrid sands; and to the south
8508,BOOK THE FIRST.,Her stormy cape. Beyond the misty main                           300
8509,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The weary eye scarce wanders, when behold"
8510,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Plata, through vaster territory poured;"
8511,BOOK THE FIRST.,"And Andes, sweeping the horizon's tract,"
8512,BOOK THE FIRST.,Mightiest of mountains! whose eternal snows
8513,BOOK THE FIRST.,Feel not the nearer sun; whose umbrage chills
8514,BOOK THE FIRST.,The murmuring ocean; whose volcanic fires
8515,BOOK THE FIRST.,"A thousand nations view, hung like the moon"
8516,BOOK THE FIRST.,"High in the middle waste of heaven; thy range,"
8517,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Shading far off the Southern hemisphere,"
8518,BOOK THE FIRST.,A dusky file Titanic.                                            310
8519,BOOK THE FIRST.,So spread
8520,BOOK THE FIRST.,Before our great forefather's view the globe
8521,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Appeared; with seas, and shady continents,"
8522,BOOK THE FIRST.,"And verdant isles, and mountains lifting dark"
8523,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Their forests, and indenting rivers, poured"
8524,BOOK THE FIRST.,"In silvery maze. And, Lo! the Angel said,"
8525,BOOK THE FIRST.,"These scenes, O Noah, thy posterity"
8526,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Shall people; but remote and scattered wide,"
8527,BOOK THE FIRST.,"They shall forget their GOD, and see no trace,"
8528,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Save dimly, of their Great Original.                             320"
8529,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Rude caves shall be their dwellings: till, with noise"
8530,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of multitudes, imperial cities rise."
8531,BOOK THE FIRST.,"But the Arch Fiend, the foe of GOD and man,"
8532,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Shall fling his spells; and, 'mid illusions drear,"

8534,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Eclipsing.--Deep in caves,[158] vault within vault"
8535,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Far winding; or in night of thickest woods,"
8536,BOOK THE FIRST.,Where no bird sings; or 'mid huge circles gray
8537,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of uncouth stone, her aspect wild, and pale"

8549,BOOK THE FIRST.,Hid in the watery waste; cold on his limbs
8550,BOOK THE FIRST.,The ocean-spray shall beat; his Deities
8551,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Shall be the stars, the thunder, and the winds;"
8552,BOOK THE FIRST.,And if a stranger on his rugged shores
8553,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Be cast, his offered blood shall stain the strand."
8554,BOOK THE FIRST.,O wretched man! who then shall raise thee up
8555,BOOK THE FIRST.,"From this thy dark estate, forlorn and lost?"
8556,BOOK THE FIRST.,The Patriarch said.
8557,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The Angel answered mild,"

8563,BOOK THE FIRST.,Sublime amid the works of GOD: the earth
8564,BOOK THE FIRST.,Shall own his wide dominion; the great sea
8565,BOOK THE FIRST.,Shall toss in vain its roaring waves; his eye
8566,BOOK THE FIRST.,Shall scan the bright orbs as they roll above
8567,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Glorious, and his expanding heart shall burn,"
8568,BOOK THE FIRST.,As wide and wider in magnificence                                360
8569,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The vast scene opens; in the winds and clouds,"
8570,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The seas, and circling planets, he shall see"
8571,BOOK THE FIRST.,The shadow of a dread Almighty move.

8573,BOOK THE FIRST.,"The darkness of the world is past:--For, hark!"
8574,BOOK THE FIRST.,Seraphs and angel-choirs with symphonies

8584,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Oh, might the strains"

8611,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of charity should scatter crimes and woe,"
8612,BOOK THE FIRST.,"And drench, where'er they pass, the earth with blood,"
8613,BOOK THE FIRST.,Might make ev'n angels weep:
8614,BOOK THE FIRST.,But the poor tribes
8615,BOOK THE FIRST.,"That groaned and died, deem not them innocent"
8616,BOOK THE FIRST.,As injured; more ensanguined rites and deeds
8617,BOOK THE FIRST.,"Of deepest stain were theirs; and what if God,"

9513,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Zarco,[182] from the deep"
9514,BOOK THE FOURTH.,What tidings?
9515,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The loud storm of night prevailed,"
9516,BOOK THE FOURTH.,And swept our vessel from Bojador's rocks
9517,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Far out to sea; a sylvan isle[183] received
9518,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Our sails; so willed the ALMIGHTY--He who speaks,"
9519,BOOK THE FOURTH.,And all the waves are still!                                      90
9520,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Hail, HENRY cried,"
9521,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The omen: we have burst the sole barrier,"

9523,BOOK THE FOURTH.,We speed to Asia.
9524,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Soon upon the deep
9525,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The brave ship speeds again. Bojador's rocks
9526,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Arise at distance, frowning o'er the surf,"
9527,BOOK THE FOURTH.,That boils for many a league without. Its course
9528,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The ship holds on; till lo! the beauteous isle,"
9529,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"That shielded late the sufferers from the storm,                 100"
9530,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Springs o'er the wave again. Here they refresh
9531,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Their wasted strength, and lift their vows to Heaven,"
9532,BOOK THE FOURTH.,But Heaven denies their further search; for ah!
9533,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"What fearful apparition, palled in clouds,"
9534,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"For ever sits upon the Western wave,"
9535,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Like night, and in its strange portentous gloom"
9536,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Wrapping the lonely waters, seems the bounds"
9537,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of Nature? Still it sits, day after day,"
9538,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The same mysterious vision. Holy saints!

9547,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The favouring gales invite; the bowsprit bears
9548,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Right onward to the fearful shade; more black

9550,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Shrinks at the view aghast and breathless. Hark!
9551,BOOK THE FOURTH.,'Twas more than the deep murmur of the surge
9552,BOOK THE FOURTH.,That struck the ear; whilst through the lurid gloom
9553,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Gigantic phantoms seem to lift in air
9554,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Their misty arms; yet, yet--bear boldly on--"
9555,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The mist dissolves;--seen through the parting haze,"
9556,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Romantic rocks, like the depictured clouds,"
9557,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Shine out; beneath a blooming wilderness
9558,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of varied wood is spread, that scents the air;"
9559,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Where fruits of ""golden rind,"" thick interspersed                130"
9560,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And pendent, through the mantling umbrage gleam"
9561,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Inviting. Cypress here, and stateliest pine,"
9562,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Spire o'er the nether shades, as emulous"

9564,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Some trees, in sunny glades alone their head"
9565,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And graceful stem uplifting, mark below"
9566,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The turf with shadow; whilst in rich festoons
9567,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The flowery lianes braid their boughs; meantime
9568,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Choirs of innumerous birds of liveliest song
9569,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And brightest plumage, flitting through the shades,              140"
9570,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"With nimble glance are seen; they, unalarmed,"
9571,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Now near in airy circles sing, then speed"
9572,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Their random flight back to their sheltering bowers,"
9573,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Whose silence, broken only by their song,"
9574,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"From the foundation of this busy world,"
9575,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Perhaps had never echoed to the voice,"
9576,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Or heard the steps, of Man. What rapture fired"
9577,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The strangers' bosoms, as from glade to glade"
9578,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"They passed, admiring all, and gazing still"
9579,BOOK THE FOURTH.,With new delight! 'Tis solitude around;                          150
9580,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Deep solitude, that on the gloom of woods"
9581,BOOK THE FOURTH.,PrimÊval fearful hangs: a green recess
9582,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Now opens in the wilderness; gay flowers
9583,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Of unknown name purple the yielding sward;
9584,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The ring-dove murmurs o'er their head, like one"
9585,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Attesting tenderest joy; but mark the trees,"
9586,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Where, slanting through the gloom, the sunshine rests!"
9587,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Beneath, a moss-grown monument appears,"
9588,BOOK THE FOURTH.,O'er which the green banana gently waves
9589,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Its long leaf; and an aged cypress near                          160
9590,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Leans, as if listening to the streamlet's sound,"
9591,BOOK THE FOURTH.,That gushes from the adverse bank; but pause--
9592,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Approach with reverence! Maker of the world,"
9593,BOOK THE FOURTH.,There is a Christian's cross! and on the stone
9594,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"A name, yet legible amid its moss,--"
9595,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Anna!
9596,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"In that remote, sequestered spot,"
9597,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Shut as it seemed from all the world, and lost"
9598,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"In boundless seas, to trace a name, to mark"
9599,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The emblems of their holy faith, from all                        170"
9600,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Drew tears; while every voice faintly pronounced,"
9601,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Anna! But thou, loved harp! whose strings have rung"
9602,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"To louder tones, oh! let my hand, awhile,"
9603,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The wires more softly touch, whilst I rehearse"
9604,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Her name and fate, who in this desert deep,"
9605,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Far from the world, from friends, and kindred, found"
9606,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Her long and last abode; there where no eye
9607,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Might shed a tear on her remains; no heart
9608,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Sigh in remembrance of her fate:--
9609,BOOK THE FOURTH.,She left                           180
9610,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The Severn's side, and fled with him she loved"
9611,BOOK THE FOURTH.,O'er the wide main; for he had told her tales
9612,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of happiness in distant lands, where care"
9613,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Comes not; and pointing to the golden clouds
9614,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"That shone above the waves, when evening came,"
9615,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Whispered--Oh, are there not sweet scenes of peace,"
9616,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Far from the murmurs of this cloudy mart,--"
9617,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Where gold alone bears sway,--scenes of delight,"
9618,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Where love may lay his head upon the lap
9619,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of innocence, and smile at all the toil                          190"
9620,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of the low-thoughted throng, that place in wealth"
9621,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Their only bliss! Yes, there are scenes like these."
9622,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Leave the vain chidings of the world behind,"
9623,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Country, and hollow friends, and fly with me"
9624,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Where love and peace in distant vales invite.
9625,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"What wouldst thou here! Oh, shall thy beauteous look"
9626,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of maiden innocence, thy smile of youth, thine eyes"
9627,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of tenderness and soft subdued desire,"
9628,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Thy form, thy limbs--oh, madness!--be the prey"
9629,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of a decrepit spoiler, and for gold?--                           200"
9630,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Perish his treasure with him. Haste with me;
9631,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"We shall find out some sylvan nook, and then,"
9632,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"If thou shouldst sometimes think upon these hills,"
9633,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"When they are distant far, and drop a tear,"
9634,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Yes--I will kiss it from thy cheek, and clasp"
9635,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Thy angel beauties closer to my breast;
9636,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And whilst the winds blow o'er us, and the sun"
9637,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Sinks beautifully down, and thy soft cheek"
9638,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Reclines on mine, I will infold thee thus,"
9639,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And proudly cry, My friend--my love--my wife!                    210"
9640,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"So tempted he, and soon her heart approved,"
9641,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Nay wooed, the blissful dream; and oft at eve,"
9642,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"When the moon shone upon the wandering stream,"
9643,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"She paced the castle's battlements, that threw"
9644,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Beneath their solemn shadow, and, resigned"
9645,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"To fancy and to tears, thought it most sweet"
9646,BOOK THE FOURTH.,To wander o'er the world with him she loved.
9647,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Nor was his birth ignoble, for he shone"
9648,BOOK THE FOURTH.,'Mid England's gallant youth in Edward's reign:
9649,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"With countenance erect, and honest eye                           220"
9650,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Commanding (yet suffused in tenderness
9651,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"At times), and smiles that like the lightning played"
9652,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"On his brown cheek,--so gently stern he stood,"
9653,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Accomplished, generous, gentle, brave, sincere,--"
9654,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Robert a Machin. But the sullen pride
9655,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Of haughty D'Arfet scorned all other claim
9656,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"To his high heritage, save what the pomp"
9657,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Of amplest wealth and loftier lineage gave.
9658,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Reckless of human tenderness, that seeks"
9659,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"One loved, one honoured object, wealth alone                     230"
9660,BOOK THE FOURTH.,He worshipped; and for this he could consign
9661,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"His only child, his aged hope, to loathed"
9662,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Embraces, and a life of tears! Nor here"
9663,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"His hard ambition ended; for he sought,"
9664,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"By secret whispers of conspiracies,"
9665,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"His sovereign to abuse, bidding him lift"
9666,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"His arm avenging, and upon a youth"
9667,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Of promise close the dark forgotten gates
9668,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of living sepulture, and in the gloom"
9669,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Inhume the slowly-wasting victim.                                240
9670,BOOK THE FOURTH.,So
9671,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"He purposed, but in vain; the ardent youth"
9672,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Rescued her--her whom more than life he loved,"
9673,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Ev'n when the horrid day of sacrifice
9674,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Drew nigh. He pointed to the distant bark,"
9675,BOOK THE FOURTH.,And while he kissed a stealing tear that fell
9676,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"On her pale cheek, as trusting she reclined"
9677,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Her head upon his breast, with ardour cried--"
9678,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Be mine, be only mine! the hour invites;"
9679,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Be mine, be only mine! So won, she cast                          250"
9680,BOOK THE FOURTH.,A look of last affection on the towers
9681,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Where she had passed her infant days, that now"
9682,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Shone to the setting sun. I follow thee,"
9683,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Her faint voice said; and lo! where in the air
9684,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"A sail hangs tremulous, and soon her feet"
9685,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Ascend the vessel's side: The vessel glides
9686,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Down the smooth current, as the twilight fades,"
9687,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Till soon the woods of Severn, and the spot"
9688,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Where D'Arfet's solitary turrets rose,"
9689,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Is lost; a tear starts to her eye, she thinks                    260"
9690,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of him whose gray head to the earth shall bend,"
9691,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"When he speaks nothing--but be all, like death,"
9692,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Forgotten. Gently blows the placid breeze,"
9693,BOOK THE FOURTH.,And oh! that now some fairy pinnace light
9694,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Might flit across the wave (by no seen power
9695,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Directed, save when Love upon the prow"
9696,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Gathered or spread with tender hand the sail),"
9697,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"That now some fairy pinnace, o'er the surge"
9698,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Silent, as in a summer's dream, might waft"
9699,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The passengers upon the conscious flood                          270
9700,BOOK THE FOURTH.,To regions bright of undisturbed joy!
9701,BOOK THE FOURTH.,But hark!
9702,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The wind is in the shrouds;--the cordage sings
9703,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"With fitful violence;--the blast now swells,"
9704,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Now sinks. Dread gloom invests the further wave,"
9705,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Whose foaming toss alone is seen, beneath"
9706,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The veering bowsprit.
9707,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Oh, retire to rest,"
9708,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Maiden, whose tender heart would beat, whose cheek"
9709,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Turn pale to see another thus exposed!                           280
9710,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Hark! the deep thunder louder peals--Oh, save!--"
9711,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The high mast crashes; but the faithful arm
9712,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of love is o'er thee, and thy anxious eye,"
9713,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Soon as the gray of morning peeps, shall view"
9714,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Green Erin's hills aspiring!
9715,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The sad morn
9716,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Comes forth; but terror on the sunless wave
9717,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Still, like a sea-fiend, sits, and darkly smiles"
9718,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Beneath the flash that through the struggling clouds
9719,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Bursts frequent, half revealing his scathed front,               290"
9720,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Above the rocking of the waste that rolls
9721,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Boundless around.
9722,BOOK THE FOURTH.,No word through the long day
9723,BOOK THE FOURTH.,She spoke;--another slowly came;--no word
9724,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The beauteous drooping mourner spoke. The sun
9725,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Twelve times had sunk beneath the sullen surge,"
9726,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And cheerless rose again:--Ah, where are now"
9727,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Thy havens, France! But yet--resign not yet--"
9728,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Ye lost seafarers--oh, resign not yet"
9729,BOOK THE FOURTH.,All hope--the storm is passed; the drenched sail                 300
9730,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Shines in the passing beam! Look up, and say--"
9731,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Heaven, thou hast heard our prayers!"
9732,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And lo! scarce seen,"
9733,BOOK THE FOURTH.,A distant dusky spot appears;--they reach
9734,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"An unknown shore, and green and flowery vales,"
9735,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And azure hills, and silver-gushing streams,"
9736,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Shine forth; a Paradise, which Heaven alone,"
9737,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Who saw the silent anguish of despair,"
9738,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Could raise in the waste wilderness of waves.
9739,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"They gain the haven; through untrodden scenes,                   310"
9740,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Perhaps untrodden by the foot of man
9741,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Since first the earth arose, they wind. The voice"
9742,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Of Nature hails them here with music, sweet,"
9743,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"As waving woods retired, or falling streams,"
9744,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Can make; most soothing to the weary heart,"
9745,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Doubly to those who, struggling with their fate,"
9746,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"And wearied long with watchings and with grief,"
9747,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Seek but a place of safety. All things here
9748,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Whisper repose and peace; the very birds
9749,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"That 'mid the golden fruitage glance their plumes,               320"
9750,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The songsters of the lonely valley, sing--"
9751,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Welcome from scenes of sorrow, live with us."
9752,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The wild wood opens, and a shady glen"
9753,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Appears, embowered with mantling laurels high,"
9754,BOOK THE FOURTH.,That sloping shade the flowery valley's side;
9755,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"A lucid stream, with gentle murmur, strays"
9756,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Beneath the umbrageous multitude of leaves,"
9757,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Till gaining, with soft lapse, the nether plain,"
9758,BOOK THE FOURTH.,It glances light along its yellow bed;--
9759,BOOK THE FOURTH.,The shaggy inmates of the forest lick                            330
9760,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The feet of their new guests, and gazing stand."
9761,BOOK THE FOURTH.,A beauteous tree upshoots amid the glade
9762,BOOK THE FOURTH.,Its trembling top; and there upon the bank
9763,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"They rest them, while each heart o'erflows with joy."
9764,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Now evening, breathing richer odours sweet,"
9765,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"Came down: a softer sound the circling seas,"
9766,BOOK THE FOURTH.,"The ancient woods resounded, while the dove,"

11024,ARGUMENT.,Castile's imperial crest illustrious shone;
11025,ARGUMENT.,"Blue in the wind the escutcheoned mantle flowed,"
11026,ARGUMENT.,"O'er the chained mail, which tinkled as he rode."
11027,ARGUMENT.,"The barred vizor raised, you might discern"
11028,ARGUMENT.,"His clime-changed countenance,[209] though pale, yet stern,"
11029,ARGUMENT.,"And resolute as death,--whilst in his eye"
11030,ARGUMENT.,"Sat proud Assurance, Fame, and Victory."
11031,ARGUMENT.,"Lautaro, now in manhood's rising pride,"
11032,ARGUMENT.,"Rode, with a lance, attendant at his side,                       100"
11033,ARGUMENT.,In Spanish mantle gracefully arrayed;
11034,ARGUMENT.,Upon his brow a tuft of feathers played:
11035,ARGUMENT.,"His glossy locks, with dark and mantling grace,"
11036,ARGUMENT.,Shaded the noonday sunbeams on his face.
11037,ARGUMENT.,"Though passed in tears the dayspring of his youth,"
11038,ARGUMENT.,Valdivia loved his gratitude and truth:
11039,ARGUMENT.,"He, in Valdivia, owned a nobler friend;"
11040,ARGUMENT.,"Kind to protect, and mighty to defend."
11041,ARGUMENT.,"So, on he rode; upon his youthful mien"
11042,ARGUMENT.,A mild but sad intelligence was seen;                            110
11043,ARGUMENT.,"Courage was on his open brow, yet care"
11044,ARGUMENT.,Seemed like a wandering shade to linger there;
11045,ARGUMENT.,"And though his eye shone, as the eagle's, bright,"
11046,ARGUMENT.,"It beamed with humid, melancholy light"
11047,ARGUMENT.,"When now Valdivia saw the embattled line,"
11048,ARGUMENT.,"Helmets, and swords, and shields, and matchlocks, shine;"
11049,ARGUMENT.,"Now the long phalanx still and steady stand,"
11050,ARGUMENT.,"Fixed every eye, and motionless each hand;"
11051,ARGUMENT.,"Then slowly clustering, into columns wheel,"
11052,ARGUMENT.,Each with the red-cross banners of Castile;                      120
11053,ARGUMENT.,"While trumps, and drums, and cymbals, to his ear"
11054,ARGUMENT.,Made music such as soldiers love to hear;
11055,ARGUMENT.,"While horsemen checked their steeds, or, bending low"
11056,ARGUMENT.,"With levelled lances, o'er the saddle-bow,"
11057,ARGUMENT.,"Rode gallantly at tilt; and thunders broke,"
11058,ARGUMENT.,"Instant involving van and rear in smoke,"
11059,ARGUMENT.,"Till winds the obscuring volume rolled away,"
11060,ARGUMENT.,"And the red file, stretched out in long array,"
11061,ARGUMENT.,More radiant moved beneath the beams of day;
11062,ARGUMENT.,"While ensigns, arms, and crosses, glittered bright,--            130"
11063,ARGUMENT.,"Philip![210] he cried, seest thou the glorious sight?"
11064,ARGUMENT.,And dost thou deem the tribes of this poor land
11065,ARGUMENT.,"Can men, and arms, and steeds, like these, withstand?"
11066,ARGUMENT.,"Forgive!--the youth replied, and checked a tear,--"
11067,ARGUMENT.,The land where my forefathers sleep is dear!--
11068,ARGUMENT.,"My native land!--this spot of blessed earth,"
11069,ARGUMENT.,"The scene where I, and all I love, had birth!"
11070,ARGUMENT.,What gratitude fidelity can give
11071,ARGUMENT.,"Is yours, my lord!--you shielded--bade me live,"
11072,ARGUMENT.,"When, in the circuit of the world so wide,                       140"
11073,ARGUMENT.,"I had but one, one only friend beside."
11074,ARGUMENT.,"I bowed resigned to fate; I kissed the hand,"
11075,ARGUMENT.,Red with the best blood of my father's land![211]
11076,ARGUMENT.,"But mighty as thou art, Valdivia, know,"
11077,ARGUMENT.,Though Cortes' desolating march laid low
11078,ARGUMENT.,"The shrines of rich, voluptuous Mexico;"
11079,ARGUMENT.,"With carcases, though proud Pizarro strew"
11080,ARGUMENT.,"The Sun's imperial temple in Peru,"
11081,ARGUMENT.,"Yet the rude dwellers of this land are brave,"
11082,ARGUMENT.,And the last spot they lose will be their grave!                 150
11083,ARGUMENT.,A moment's crimson crossed Valdivia's cheek--
11084,ARGUMENT.,"Then o'er the plain he spurred, nor deigned to speak,"
11085,ARGUMENT.,"Waving the youth, at distance, to retire;"
11086,ARGUMENT.,None saw the eye that shot terrific fire.
11087,ARGUMENT.,"As their commander sternly rode along,"
11088,ARGUMENT.,"Troop after troop, halted the martial throng;"
11089,ARGUMENT.,And all the pennoned trumps a louder blast
11090,ARGUMENT.,"Blew, as the Southern World's great victor passed."
11091,ARGUMENT.,"Lautaro turned, scarce heeding, from the view,"
11092,ARGUMENT.,And from the noise of trumps and drums withdrew;                 160
11093,ARGUMENT.,"And now, while troubled thoughts his bosom swell,"
11094,ARGUMENT.,Seeks the gray Missionary's humble cell.
11095,ARGUMENT.,"Fronting the ocean, but beyond the ken"
11096,ARGUMENT.,"Of public view, and sounds of murmuring men,"
11097,ARGUMENT.,"Of unhewn roots composed, and gnarled wood,"
11098,ARGUMENT.,A small and rustic oratory stood;
11099,ARGUMENT.,"Upon its roof of reeds appeared a cross,"
11100,ARGUMENT.,The porch within was lined with mantling moss;
11101,ARGUMENT.,"A crucifix and hour-glass, on each side--"
11102,ARGUMENT.,"One to admonish seemed, and one to guide;                        170"
11103,ARGUMENT.,"This, to impress how soon life's race is o'er;"
11104,ARGUMENT.,"And that, to lift our hopes where time shall be no more."
11105,ARGUMENT.,"O'er the rude porch, with wild and gadding stray,"
11106,ARGUMENT.,The clustering copu weaved its trellis gay;
11107,ARGUMENT.,"Two mossy pines, high bending, interwove"
11108,ARGUMENT.,Their aged and fantastic arms above.
11109,ARGUMENT.,"In front, amid the gay surrounding flowers,"
11110,ARGUMENT.,"A dial counted the departing hours,"
11111,ARGUMENT.,"On which the sweetest light of summer shone,--"
11112,ARGUMENT.,A rude and brief inscription marked the stone:                   180
11113,ARGUMENT.,"To count, with passing shade, the hours,"
11114,ARGUMENT.,I placed the dial 'mid the flowers;
11115,ARGUMENT.,"That, one by one, came forth, and died,"
11116,ARGUMENT.,"Blooming, and withering, round its side."
11117,ARGUMENT.,"Mortal, let the sight impart"
11118,ARGUMENT.,Its pensive moral to thy heart!
11119,ARGUMENT.,"Just heard to trickle through a covert near,"
11120,ARGUMENT.,"And soothing, with perpetual lapse, the ear,"
11121,ARGUMENT.,"A fount, like rain-drops, filtered through the stone,"
11122,ARGUMENT.,"And, bright as amber, on the shallows shone.                     190"
11123,ARGUMENT.,"Intent his fairy pastime to pursue,"
11124,ARGUMENT.,"And, gem-like, hovering o'er the violets blue,"
11125,ARGUMENT.,"The humming-bird, here, its unceasing song"
11126,ARGUMENT.,"Heedlessly murmured, all the summer long;"
11127,ARGUMENT.,"And when the winter came, retired to rest,"
11128,ARGUMENT.,And from the myrtles hung its trembling nest.
11129,ARGUMENT.,No sounds of a conflicting world were near;
11130,ARGUMENT.,"The noise of ocean faintly met the ear,"
11131,ARGUMENT.,"That seemed, as sunk to rest the noontide blast,"
11132,ARGUMENT.,But dying sounds of passions that were past;                     200
11133,ARGUMENT.,"Or closing anthems, when, far off, expire"
11134,ARGUMENT.,The lessening echoes of the distant choir.
11135,ARGUMENT.,"Here, every human sorrow hushed to rest,"
11136,ARGUMENT.,"His pale hands meekly crossed upon his breast,"
11137,ARGUMENT.,"Anselmo sat: the sun, with westering ray,"
11138,ARGUMENT.,"Just touched his temples, and his locks of gray."
11139,ARGUMENT.,There was no worldly feeling in his eye;
11140,ARGUMENT.,"The world to him was ""as a thing gone by."""
11141,ARGUMENT.,"Now, all his features lit, he raised his look,"
11142,ARGUMENT.,"Then bent it thoughtful, and unclasped the book;                 210"
11143,ARGUMENT.,"And whilst the hour-glass shed its silent sand,"
11144,ARGUMENT.,A tame opossum[212] licked his withered hand.
11145,ARGUMENT.,"That sweetest light of slow-declining day,"
11146,ARGUMENT.,"Which through the trellis poured its slanting ray,"
11147,ARGUMENT.,"Resting a moment on his few gray hairs,"
11148,ARGUMENT.,Seemed light from heaven sent down to bless his prayers.
11149,ARGUMENT.,"When the trump echoed to the quiet spot,"
11150,ARGUMENT.,"He thought upon the world, but mourned it not;"
11151,ARGUMENT.,"Enough if his meek wisdom could control,"
11152,ARGUMENT.,"And bend to mercy, one proud soldier's soul;                     220"
11153,ARGUMENT.,"Enough, if, while these distant scenes he trod,"
11154,ARGUMENT.,He led one erring Indian to his God.
11155,ARGUMENT.,Whence comes my son? with kind complacent look
11156,ARGUMENT.,"He asked, and closed again the embossed book."
11157,ARGUMENT.,"I come to thee for peace, the youth replied:"
11158,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, there is strife, and cruelty, and pride,"
11159,ARGUMENT.,In this sad Christian world! My native land
11160,ARGUMENT.,"Was happy, ere the soldier, with his band"
11161,ARGUMENT.,"Of fell destroyers, like a vulture, came,"
11162,ARGUMENT.,And gave its peaceful scenes to blood and flame.                 230
11163,ARGUMENT.,When will the turmoil of earth's tempests cease?
11164,ARGUMENT.,"Father, I come to thee for peace--for peace!"
11165,ARGUMENT.,"Seek peace, the father cried, with God above:"
11166,ARGUMENT.,"In His good time, all will be peace and love."
11167,ARGUMENT.,"We mourn, indeed, mourn that all sounds of ill,"
11168,ARGUMENT.,Earth's fairest scenes with one deep murmur fill;
11169,ARGUMENT.,"That yonder sun, when evening paints the sky,"
11170,ARGUMENT.,"Sinks, beauteous, on a world of misery;"
11171,ARGUMENT.,"The course of wide destruction to withstand,"
11172,ARGUMENT.,We lift our feeble voice--our trembling hand;                    240
11173,ARGUMENT.,"But still, bowed low, or smitten to the dust,"
11174,ARGUMENT.,"Father of mercy, still in Thee we trust!"
11175,ARGUMENT.,"Through good or ill, in poverty or wealth,"
11176,ARGUMENT.,"In joy or woe, in sickness or in health,"
11177,ARGUMENT.,"Meek Piety thy awful hand surveys,"
11178,ARGUMENT.,And the faint murmur turns to prayer and praise!
11179,ARGUMENT.,We know--whatever evils we deplore--
11180,ARGUMENT.,"Thou hast permitted, and we know no more!"
11181,ARGUMENT.,"Behold, illustrious on the subject plain,"
11182,ARGUMENT.,Some tow'r-crowned city of imperial Spain!                       250
11183,ARGUMENT.,Hark! 'twas the earthquake![213] clouds of dust alone
11184,ARGUMENT.,"Ascend from earth, where tower and temple shone!"
11185,ARGUMENT.,Such is the conqueror's dread path: the grave
11186,ARGUMENT.,Yawns for its millions where his banners wave;
11187,ARGUMENT.,"But shall vain man, whose life is but a sigh,"
11188,ARGUMENT.,With sullen acquiescence gaze and die?
11189,ARGUMENT.,"Alas, how little of the mighty maze"
11190,ARGUMENT.,Of Providence our mortal ken surveys!
11191,ARGUMENT.,"Heaven's awful Lord, pavilioned in the clouds,"
11192,ARGUMENT.,Looks through the darkness that all nature shrouds;              260
11193,ARGUMENT.,"And, far beyond the tempest and the night,"
11194,ARGUMENT.,Bids man his course hold on to scenes of endless light.

11302,ARGUMENT.,"With patient toil I raised a massy stone,"
11303,ARGUMENT.,And looked into a depth of shade unknown;
11304,ARGUMENT.,The murky twilight of the lurid place
11305,ARGUMENT.,"Helped me, at length, a secret way to trace:"
11306,ARGUMENT.,"I entered; step by step explored the road,"
11307,ARGUMENT.,"In darkness, from my desolate abode;                              90"
11308,ARGUMENT.,"Till, winding through long passages of night,"
11309,ARGUMENT.,"I saw, at distance, a dim streak of light:--"
11310,ARGUMENT.,"It was the sun--the bright, the blessed beam"
11311,ARGUMENT.,Of day! I knelt--I wept;--the glittering stream
11312,ARGUMENT.,"Rolled on beneath me, as I left the cave,"
11313,ARGUMENT.,Concealed in woods above the winding wave.
11314,ARGUMENT.,"I rested on a verdant bank a while,"
11315,ARGUMENT.,I saw around the summer landscape smile;
11316,ARGUMENT.,"I gained a peasant's hut; nor dared to leave,"
11317,ARGUMENT.,"Till, with slow step, advanced the glimmering eve.               100"
11318,ARGUMENT.,"Remembering still affection's fondest hours,"
11319,ARGUMENT.,I turned my footsteps to the city towers;
11320,ARGUMENT.,"In pilgrim's dress, I traced the streets unknown:"
11321,ARGUMENT.,No light in Leonora's lattice shone.
11322,ARGUMENT.,The morning came; the busy tumult swells;
11323,ARGUMENT.,"Knolling to church, I heard the minster bells;"
11324,ARGUMENT.,"Involuntary to that scene I strayed,"
11325,ARGUMENT.,"Disguised, where first I saw my faithful maid."
11326,ARGUMENT.,"I saw her, pallid, at the altar stand,"
11327,ARGUMENT.,"And yield, half-shrinking, her reluctant hand;                   110"
11328,ARGUMENT.,"She turned her head; she saw my hollow eyes,"
11329,ARGUMENT.,"And knew me, wasted, wan, in my disguise;"
11330,ARGUMENT.,"She shrieked, and fell;--breathless, I left the fane"
11331,ARGUMENT.,In agony--nor saw her form again;
11332,ARGUMENT.,"And from that day her voice, her look were given,"
11333,ARGUMENT.,"Her name, her memory, to the winds of heaven."
11334,ARGUMENT.,"Far off I bent my melancholy way,"
11335,ARGUMENT.,"Heart-sick and faint, and, in this gown of gray,"
11336,ARGUMENT.,"From every human eye my sorrows hid,"
11337,ARGUMENT.,"Unknown, amidst the tumult of Madrid.                            120"
11338,ARGUMENT.,"Grief in my heart, despair upon my look,"
11339,ARGUMENT.,"With no companion save my beads and book,"

11344,ARGUMENT.,"One winter's night, when I had closed my cell,"
11345,ARGUMENT.,"And bid the labours of the day farewell,"
11346,ARGUMENT.,"An aged crone approached, with panting breath,"
11347,ARGUMENT.,And bade me hasten to the house of death.                        130
11348,ARGUMENT.,"I came. With moving lips intent to pray,"
11349,ARGUMENT.,A dying woman on a pallet lay;
11350,ARGUMENT.,"Her lifted hands were wasted to the bone,"
11351,ARGUMENT.,And ghastly on her look the lamp-light shone;
11352,ARGUMENT.,Beside the bed a pious daughter stands
11353,ARGUMENT.,"Silent, and, weeping, kisses her pale hands."
11354,ARGUMENT.,"Feebly she spoke, and raised her languid head,"
11355,ARGUMENT.,"Forgive, forgive!--they told me he was dead!--"
11356,ARGUMENT.,"But in the sunshine of that dreadful day,"
11357,ARGUMENT.,"That gave me to another's arms away,                             140"
11358,ARGUMENT.,"I saw him, like a ghost, with deadly stare;"
11359,ARGUMENT.,I saw his wasted eye-balls' ghastly glare;
11360,ARGUMENT.,"I saw his lips (oh, hide them, God of love!)"
11361,ARGUMENT.,"I saw his livid lips, half-muttering, move,"
11362,ARGUMENT.,To curse the maid--forgetful of her vow:--
11363,ARGUMENT.,Perhaps he lives to curse--to curse me now!
11364,ARGUMENT.,"He lives to bless! I cried; and, drawing nigh,"
11365,ARGUMENT.,Held up the crucifix; her heavy eye

11375,ARGUMENT.,"The tale of fraudful falsehood I believed,"
11376,ARGUMENT.,"And thought thee dead; he gave the stern command,"

11383,ARGUMENT.,Already my full heart has had its share:
11384,ARGUMENT.,"Abandoned, left in youth to want and woe,"
11385,ARGUMENT.,"Oh! let these tears, that agonising flow,"
11386,ARGUMENT.,Witness how deep ev'n now my heart is rent!
11387,ARGUMENT.,Yet one is lovely--one is innocent!                              170
11388,ARGUMENT.,"Protect, protect, (and faint in death she smiled)"
11389,ARGUMENT.,"When I am dead, protect my orphan child!"

11392,ARGUMENT.,"The wretched priest, who wounded me by stealth,"
11393,ARGUMENT.,"Bartered her love, her innocence for wealth!"
11394,ARGUMENT.,I laid her bones in earth; the chanted hymn
11395,ARGUMENT.,Echoed along the hollow cloister dim;
11396,ARGUMENT.,"I heard, far off, the bell funereal toll,"
11397,ARGUMENT.,And sorrowing said: Now peace be with her soul!                  180
11398,ARGUMENT.,"Far o'er the Western Ocean I conveyed,"
11399,ARGUMENT.,And Indiana called the orphan maid;
11400,ARGUMENT.,"Beneath my eye she grew, and, day by day,"
11401,ARGUMENT.,"Seemed, grateful, every kindness to repay."
11402,ARGUMENT.,"Renouncing Spain, her cruelties and crimes,"

11406,ARGUMENT.,"I saw thee, young and innocent, alone,"
11407,ARGUMENT.,Cast on the mercies of a race unknown;                           190
11408,ARGUMENT.,"I saw, in dark adversity's cold hour,"
11409,ARGUMENT.,"Thy virtues blooming, like a winter's flower;"
11410,ARGUMENT.,"From chains and slavery I redeemed thy youth,"
11411,ARGUMENT.,Poured on thy mental sight the beams of truth;
11412,ARGUMENT.,"By thy warm heart and mild demeanour won,"
11413,ARGUMENT.,Called thee my other child--my age's son.
11414,ARGUMENT.,I need not tell the sequel;--not unmoved
11415,ARGUMENT.,"Poor Indiana heard thy tale, and loved;"
11416,ARGUMENT.,Some sympathy a kindred fate might claim;
11417,ARGUMENT.,"Your years, your fortunes, and your friend the same;"
11418,ARGUMENT.,"Both early of a parent's care bereft,                            201"
11419,ARGUMENT.,Both strangers in a world of sadness left;
11420,ARGUMENT.,I marked each slowly-struggling thought; I shed
11421,ARGUMENT.,A tear of love paternal on each head;
11422,ARGUMENT.,"And, while I saw her timid eyes incline,"
11423,ARGUMENT.,Blessed the affection that had made her thine!
11424,ARGUMENT.,Here let the murmurs of despondence cease:
11425,ARGUMENT.,There is a God--believe--and part in peace!
11426,ARGUMENT.,Rich hues illumed the track of dying day
11427,ARGUMENT.,"As the great sun sank in the western bay,                        210"
11428,ARGUMENT.,"And only its last light yet lingering shone,"
11429,ARGUMENT.,Upon the highest palm-tree's feathery cone;
11430,ARGUMENT.,"When at a distance on the dewy plain,"
11431,ARGUMENT.,In mingled group appeared an Indian train;
11432,ARGUMENT.,"Men, women, children, round Anselmo press,"
11433,ARGUMENT.,"Farewell! they cried. He raised his hand to bless,"
11434,ARGUMENT.,"And said: My children, may the God above"

11443,ARGUMENT.,"The condor kept its solitary way,"
11444,ARGUMENT.,"The fire-flies shone, when to the hermit's cell"
11445,ARGUMENT.,Who hastens but the minstrel Zarinel!
11446,ARGUMENT.,"In foreign lands, far from his native home,"
11447,ARGUMENT.,"'Twas his, a gay, romantic youth, to roam,                       230"
11448,ARGUMENT.,"With a light cittern o'er his shoulders slung,"
11449,ARGUMENT.,"Where'er he passed he played, and loved, and sung;"
11450,ARGUMENT.,"And thus accomplished, late had joined the train"
11451,ARGUMENT.,Of gallant soldiers on the southern plain.
11452,ARGUMENT.,"Father, he cried, uncertain of the fate"
11453,ARGUMENT.,"That may to-morrow's toilsome march await,"
11454,ARGUMENT.,"For long will be the road, I would confess"
11455,ARGUMENT.,Some secret thoughts that on my bosom press.
11456,ARGUMENT.,"They are of one I left, an Indian maid,"
11457,ARGUMENT.,Whose trusting love my careless heart betrayed.                  240
11458,ARGUMENT.,"Say, may I speak?"
11459,ARGUMENT.,"Say on, the father cried,"
11460,ARGUMENT.,Nor be to penitence all hope denied.
11461,ARGUMENT.,"Then hear, Anselmo! From a very child"
11462,ARGUMENT.,I loved all fancies marvellous and wild;
11463,ARGUMENT.,"I turned from truth, to listen to the lore"
11464,ARGUMENT.,Of many an old and fabling troubadour.
11465,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, with impassioned heart, and wayward mind,"
11466,ARGUMENT.,"To dreams and shapes of shadowy things resigned,"
11467,ARGUMENT.,"I left my native vales and village home,                         250"
11468,ARGUMENT.,Wide o'er the world a minstrel boy to roam.
11469,ARGUMENT.,"I never shall forget the day, the hour,"
11470,ARGUMENT.,"When, all my soul resigned to Fancy's power,"
11471,ARGUMENT.,"First, from the snowy Pyrenees, I cast"
11472,ARGUMENT.,"My labouring vision o'er the landscape vast,"
11473,ARGUMENT.,"And saw beneath my feet long vapours float,"
11474,ARGUMENT.,"Streams, mountains, woods, and ocean's mist remote."
11475,ARGUMENT.,"There once I met a soldier, poor and old,"
11476,ARGUMENT.,"Who tales of Cortes and Bilboa told,"
11477,ARGUMENT.,"And this new world; he spoke of Indian maids,                    260"
11478,ARGUMENT.,"Rivers like seas, and forests whose deep shades"
11479,ARGUMENT.,"Had never yet been pierced by morning ray,"
11480,ARGUMENT.,"And how the green bird mocked, and talked all day."
11481,ARGUMENT.,"Imagination thus, in colours new,"
11482,ARGUMENT.,This distant world presented to my view;
11483,ARGUMENT.,"Young, and enchanted with the fancied scene,"
11484,ARGUMENT.,"I crossed the toiling seas that roared between,"
11485,ARGUMENT.,"And with ideal images impressed,"
11486,ARGUMENT.,Stood on these unknown shores a wondering guest.
11487,ARGUMENT.,"Still to romantic phantasies resigned,                         270"
11488,ARGUMENT.,"I left Callao's crowded port behind,"
11489,ARGUMENT.,And climbed the mountains which their shadow threw
11490,ARGUMENT.,Upon the lessening summits of Peru.
11491,ARGUMENT.,"Some sheep the armed peasants drove before,"
11492,ARGUMENT.,"That all our food through the wild passes bore,"
11493,ARGUMENT.,"Had wandered in the frost-smoke of the morn,"
11494,ARGUMENT.,Far from the track; I blew the signal horn--
11495,ARGUMENT.,"But echo only answered: 'mid the snows,"
11496,ARGUMENT.,"Wildered and lost, I saw the evening close."
11497,ARGUMENT.,The sun was setting in the crimson west;                         280
11498,ARGUMENT.,In all the earth I had no home of rest;
11499,ARGUMENT.,The last sad light upon the ice-hills shone;
11500,ARGUMENT.,I seemed forsaken in a world unknown;
11501,ARGUMENT.,"How did my cold and sinking heart rejoice,"
11502,ARGUMENT.,"When, hark! methought I heard a human voice!"
11503,ARGUMENT.,"It might be some wild Indian's roving troop,"
11504,ARGUMENT.,Or the dread echo of their distant whoop;
11505,ARGUMENT.,"Still it was human, and I seemed to find"
11506,ARGUMENT.,Again some commerce with remote mankind.
11507,ARGUMENT.,"The voice comes nearer, rising through the shade--               290"
11508,ARGUMENT.,Is it the song of some rude mountain-maid?
11509,ARGUMENT.,"And now I heard the tread of hastening feet,"
11510,ARGUMENT.,"And, in the western glen, a Llama bleat."
11511,ARGUMENT.,I listened--all is still; but hark! again
11512,ARGUMENT.,Near and more near is heard the welcome strain;
11513,ARGUMENT.,"It is a wild maid's carolling, who seeks"
11514,ARGUMENT.,Her wandering Llama 'midst the snowy peaks:
11515,ARGUMENT.,"Truant, she cried, thy lurking place is found!"
11516,ARGUMENT.,"With languid touch I waked the cittern's sound,"
11517,ARGUMENT.,"And soon a maid, by the pale light, I saw                        300"
11518,ARGUMENT.,Gaze breathless with astonishment and awe:
11519,ARGUMENT.,"What instant terrors to her fancy rose,"
11520,ARGUMENT.,Ha! is it not the Spirit of the snows!
11521,ARGUMENT.,"But when she saw me, weary, cold, and weak,"
11522,ARGUMENT.,"Stretch forth my hand (for now I could not speak),"
11523,ARGUMENT.,"She pitied, raised me from the snows, and led"
11524,ARGUMENT.,My faltering footsteps to her father's shed;
11525,ARGUMENT.,The Llama followed with her tinkling bell;
11526,ARGUMENT.,"The dwelling rose within a craggy dell,"
11527,ARGUMENT.,"O'erhung with icy summits. To be brief,                          310"
11528,ARGUMENT.,She was the daughter of an aged chief;
11529,ARGUMENT.,"He, by her gentle voice to pity won,"
11530,ARGUMENT.,"Showed mercy, for himself had lost a son."
11531,ARGUMENT.,"The father spoke not; by the pine-wood blaze,"
11532,ARGUMENT.,"The daughter stood, and turned a cake of maize;"
11533,ARGUMENT.,"And then, as sudden shone the light, I saw"
11534,ARGUMENT.,Such features as no artist hand might draw.
11535,ARGUMENT.,"Her form, her face, her symmetry, her air,"
11536,ARGUMENT.,Father! thy age must such recital spare:--
11537,ARGUMENT.,"She saved my life; and kindness, if not love,                    320"
11538,ARGUMENT.,Might sure in time the coldest bosom move!
11539,ARGUMENT.,"Mine was not cold; she loved to hear me sing,"
11540,ARGUMENT.,And sometimes touched with playful hand the string;
11541,ARGUMENT.,"And when I waked some melancholy strain,"
11542,ARGUMENT.,"She wept, and smiled, and bade me sing again."
11543,ARGUMENT.,"So many a happy day, in this deep glen,"
11544,ARGUMENT.,"Far from the noise of life, and sounds of men,"
11545,ARGUMENT.,"Was passed! Nay, father, the sad sequel hear:"
11546,ARGUMENT.,'Twas now the leafy spring-time of the year--
11547,ARGUMENT.,"Ambition called me: true, I knew to part                         330"
11548,ARGUMENT.,"Would break her generous, warm, and trusting heart;"
11549,ARGUMENT.,"True, I had vowed, but now estranged and cold,"
11550,ARGUMENT.,"She saw my look, and shuddered to behold:--"
11551,ARGUMENT.,"She would go with me, leave the lonely glade"

11555,ARGUMENT.,"Go to thy distant land, forget this tear,"
11556,ARGUMENT.,"Forget these rocks, forget I once was dear;"
11557,ARGUMENT.,"Fly to the world, o'er the wide ocean fly,                       340"
11558,ARGUMENT.,And leave me unremembered here to die!
11559,ARGUMENT.,"Yet to my father should I all relate,"
11560,ARGUMENT.,"Death, instant death, would be a traitor's fate!"
11561,ARGUMENT.,"Nor fear, nor pity moved my stubborn mind,"
11562,ARGUMENT.,I left her sorrows and the scene behind;
11563,ARGUMENT.,"I sought Valdivia on the southern plain,"
11564,ARGUMENT.,And joined the careless military train;
11565,ARGUMENT.,"Oh! ere I sleep, thus, lowly on my knee,"
11566,ARGUMENT.,"Father, I absolution crave from thee!"
11567,ARGUMENT.,"Anselmo spoke, with look and voice severe:                     350"
11568,ARGUMENT.,"Yes, thoughtless youth, my absolution hear."
11569,ARGUMENT.,"First, by deep penitence the wrong atone,"
11570,ARGUMENT.,Then absolution ask from God alone!
11571,ARGUMENT.,"Yet stay, and to my warning voice attend,"
11572,ARGUMENT.,"And hear me as a father, and a friend."
11573,ARGUMENT.,"Let Truth severe be wayward Fancy's guide,"
11574,ARGUMENT.,Let stern-eyed Conscience o'er each thought preside;
11575,ARGUMENT.,"The passions, that on noblest natures prey,"
11576,ARGUMENT.,"Oh! cast them, like corroding bonds, away!"
11577,ARGUMENT.,"Disdain to act mean falsehood's coward part,                     360"
11578,ARGUMENT.,And let religion dignify thine art.
11579,ARGUMENT.,"If, by thy bed, thou seest at midnight stand"
11580,ARGUMENT.,"Pale Conscience, pointing, with terrific hand,"
11581,ARGUMENT.,"To deeds of darkness done, whilst, like a corse,"
11582,ARGUMENT.,"To shake thy soul, uprises dire Remorse;"
11583,ARGUMENT.,"Fly to God's mercy, fly, ere yet too late--"
11584,ARGUMENT.,Perhaps one hour marks thy eternal fate;
11585,ARGUMENT.,"Let the warm tear of deep contrition flow,"

11587,ARGUMENT.,"The last vain follies of thy youth deplore,                      370"
11588,ARGUMENT.,"Then go, in secret weep, and sin no more!"
11589,ARGUMENT.,The stars innumerous in their watches shone--
11590,ARGUMENT.,Anselmo knelt before the cross alone.
11591,ARGUMENT.,"Ten thousand glowing orbs their pomp displayed,"
11592,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst, looking up, thus silently he prayed:--"
11593,ARGUMENT.,"Oh! how oppressive to the aching sense,"
11594,ARGUMENT.,"How fearful were this vast magnificence,"
11595,ARGUMENT.,"This prodigality of glory, spread"
11596,ARGUMENT.,"Above a poor and dying emmet's head,"
11597,ARGUMENT.,That toiled his transient hour upon the shore                    380
11598,ARGUMENT.,"Of mortal life, and then was seen no more;"
11599,ARGUMENT.,"If man beheld, on his terrific throne,"
11600,ARGUMENT.,"A dark, cold, distant Deity, alone!"
11601,ARGUMENT.,"Felt no relating, no endearing tie,"
11602,ARGUMENT.,"That Hope might upwards raise her glistening eye,"
11603,ARGUMENT.,"And think, with deep unutterable bliss,"
11604,ARGUMENT.,In yonder radiant realm my kingdom is!
11605,ARGUMENT.,"More glorious than those orbs that silent roll,"
11606,ARGUMENT.,Shines Heaven's redeeming mercy on the soul--
11607,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, pure effulgence of unbounded love!                           390"
11608,ARGUMENT.,"In Thee, I think--I feel--I live--I move;"
11609,ARGUMENT.,"Yet when, O Thou, whose name is Love and Light,"

12057,INDIAN.,"Yet more, the impatient warrior cried; yet more!"
12058,INDIAN.,"Say, shall I live, and drink the tyrant's gore?"
12059,INDIAN.,'Twas silence. Speak! he cried: none made reply.
12060,INDIAN.,"At once strange thunder shook the distant sky,"
12061,INDIAN.,"And all was o'er; the grisly shapes are flown,"
12062,INDIAN.,And the grim warrior stands in the wild woods alone.

12064,INDIAN.,"And the gray friars were chanting at their primes,"
12065,INDIAN.,"When winds, as of a rushing hurricane,"
12066,INDIAN.,Shook the tall windows of the towered fane;--
12067,INDIAN.,"Sounds more than earthly with the storm arose,"
12068,INDIAN.,"And a dire troop are passed to Andes' snows,"
12069,INDIAN.,Where mighty spirits in mysterious ring
12070,INDIAN.,"Their dread prophetic incantations sing,"
12071,INDIAN.,"Round Chillan's crater-smoke, whose lurid light"
12072,INDIAN.,Streams high against the hollow cope of night.
12073,INDIAN.,"Thy genius, Andes, towering o'er the rest,                       120"
12074,INDIAN.,"Rose vast, and thus a phantom-shape addressed:"
12075,INDIAN.,Who comes so swift amid the storm?
12076,INDIAN.,"Ha! I know thy bloodless form,"
12077,INDIAN.,"I know thee, angel, who thou art,"
12078,INDIAN.,By the hissing of thy dart!
12079,INDIAN.,"'Tis Death, the king! the rocks around,"
12080,INDIAN.,Hark! echo back the fearful sound;--
12081,INDIAN.,"'Tis Death, the king! away, away!"
12082,INDIAN.,The famished vulture scents its prey.
12083,INDIAN.,"Spectre, hence! we cannot die--                           130"
12084,INDIAN.,Thy withering weapons we defy;
12085,INDIAN.,Dire and potent as thou art!
12086,INDIAN.,Then spoke the phantom of the uplifted dart:
12087,INDIAN.,"Spirits who in darkness dwell,"
12088,INDIAN.,I heard far off your secret spell!
12089,INDIAN.,"Enough, on yonder fatal shore,"
12090,INDIAN.,My fiends have drank your children's gore;
12091,INDIAN.,"Lo! I come, and doom to fate"
12092,INDIAN.,"The murderers, and the foe you hate!"
12093,INDIAN.,"Of all who shook their hostile spears,                    140"
12094,INDIAN.,"And marked their way through blood and tears,"
12095,INDIAN.,(Now sleeping still on yonder plain)
12096,INDIAN.,"But one--one only shall remain,"
12097,INDIAN.,Ere thrice the morn shall shine again.
12098,INDIAN.,"Then sang the mighty spirits. Thee, they sing,"
12099,INDIAN.,"Hail to thee, Death, all hail to Death, the king!"
12100,INDIAN.,"The penguin flaps her wings in gore,"
12101,INDIAN.,"Devoted Spain, along the shore."
12102,INDIAN.,"Whence that shriek? with ghastly eyes,"
12103,INDIAN.,Thy victor-chief abandoned lies!                          150
12104,INDIAN.,"Victor of the southern world,"
12105,INDIAN.,Whose crimson banners were unfurled
12106,INDIAN.,"O'er the silence of the waves,--"
12107,INDIAN.,O'er a land of bleeding slaves!
12108,INDIAN.,"Victor, where is now thy boast;"
12109,INDIAN.,"Thine iron steeds, thy mailed host?"
12110,INDIAN.,Hark! hark! even now I hear his cries!--

12179,ARGUMENT.,"The song, the shout, and his loved country's name."
12180,ARGUMENT.,"As swelled at times the trump's insulting sound,"
12181,ARGUMENT.,He raised his eyes impatient from the ground;
12182,ARGUMENT.,"Then smote his breast indignantly, and cried,"

12189,ARGUMENT.,"Hold, soldier! stern, inhuman soldier, spare!"

12192,ARGUMENT.,"Leave me, dread shadow! Can I then forget"
12193,ARGUMENT.,My father's look--his voice? He beckons yet!
12194,ARGUMENT.,Now on that glimmering rock I see him stand:
12195,ARGUMENT.,"Avenge! he cries, and waves his dim-seen hand!"
12196,ARGUMENT.,"Thus mused the youth, distempered and forlorn,"
12197,ARGUMENT.,"When, hark! the sound as of a distant horn                        70"
12198,ARGUMENT.,"Swells o'er the surge! he turned his look around,"
12199,ARGUMENT.,"And still, with many a pause, he heard the sound:"
12200,ARGUMENT.,"It came from yonder rocks; and, list! what strain"
12201,ARGUMENT.,Breaks on the silence of the sleeping main?
12202,ARGUMENT.,I heard the song of gladness;
12203,ARGUMENT.,"It seemed but yesterday,"
12204,ARGUMENT.,"But it turned my thoughts to madness,"
12205,ARGUMENT.,So soon it died away:
12206,ARGUMENT.,I sound my sea-shell; but in vain I try
12207,ARGUMENT.,To bring back that enchanting harmony!                          80
12208,ARGUMENT.,"Hark! heard ye not the surges say,"
12209,ARGUMENT.,"Oh! heartless maid, what canst thou do?"
12210,ARGUMENT.,"O'er the moon-gleaming ocean, I'll wander away,"
12211,ARGUMENT.,And paddle to Spain in my light canoe!
12212,ARGUMENT.,"The youth drew near, by the strange accents led,"
12213,ARGUMENT.,"Where in a cave, wild sea-weeds round her head,"
12214,ARGUMENT.,"And holding a large sea-conch in her hand,"
12215,ARGUMENT.,"He saw, with wildering air, an Indian maiden stand.               90"
12216,ARGUMENT.,A tattered poncho o'er her shoulders hung;
12217,ARGUMENT.,On either side her long black locks were flung;
12218,ARGUMENT.,"And now by the moon's glimmer, he espies"
12219,ARGUMENT.,"Her high cheek-bones, and bright but hollow eyes."
12220,ARGUMENT.,Lautaro spoke: Oh! say what cruel wrong
12221,ARGUMENT.,"Weighs on thy heart, maiden, what bodes thy song?"
12222,ARGUMENT.,"She answered not, but blew her shell again;"
12223,ARGUMENT.,Then thus renewed the desultory strain:
12224,ARGUMENT.,"Yes, yes, we must forget! the world is wide;"
12225,ARGUMENT.,My music now shall be the dashing tide:                          100
12226,ARGUMENT.,In the calm of the deep I will frolic and swim--
12227,ARGUMENT.,With the breath of the South o'er the sea-blossom[225] skim.
12228,ARGUMENT.,"If ever, stranger, on thy way,"
12229,ARGUMENT.,"Sounds, more than earthly sweet, thy soul should move,"
12230,ARGUMENT.,It is the youth! Oh! do not say--
12231,ARGUMENT.,That poor Olola died for love.
12232,ARGUMENT.,"Lautaro stretched his hand; she said, Adieu!"
12233,ARGUMENT.,And o'er the glimmering rocks like lightning flew.
12234,ARGUMENT.,"He followed, and still heard at distance swell"
12235,ARGUMENT.,The lessening echoes of that mournful shell.                     110
12236,ARGUMENT.,It ceased at once; and now he heard no more
12237,ARGUMENT.,Than the sea's murmur dying on the shore.
12238,ARGUMENT.,Olola!--ha! his sister had that name!
12239,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, horrid fancies! shake not thus his frame!"
12240,ARGUMENT.,"All night he wandered by the desert main,"
12241,ARGUMENT.,To catch the melancholy sounds again.
12242,ARGUMENT.,No torches blaze in Penco's castled hall
12243,ARGUMENT.,That echoed to the midnight festival.
12244,ARGUMENT.,"The weary soldiers by their toils oppressed,"
12245,ARGUMENT.,Had now retired to silence and to rest.                          120
12246,ARGUMENT.,"The minstrel only, who the song had sung"
12247,ARGUMENT.,"Of noble Cid, as o'er the strings he hung,"
12248,ARGUMENT.,"Upon the instrument had fall'n asleep,"
12249,ARGUMENT.,"Weary, and now was hushed in slumbers deep."
12250,ARGUMENT.,"Tracing the scenes long past, in busy dreams"
12251,ARGUMENT.,Again he wanders by his native streams;
12252,ARGUMENT.,"Or sits, his evening saraband to sing"
12253,ARGUMENT.,To the clear Garonne's gentle murmuring.
12254,ARGUMENT.,Cold o'er the fleckered clouds the morning broke
12255,ARGUMENT.,Aslant ere from his slumbers he awoke;                           130
12256,ARGUMENT.,"Still as he sat, nor yet had left the place,"
12257,ARGUMENT.,The first dim light fell on his pallid face.
12258,ARGUMENT.,He wakes--he gazes round--the dawning day
12259,ARGUMENT.,"Comes from the deep, in garb of cloudy gray."
12260,ARGUMENT.,"The woods with crow of early turkeys ring,"
12261,ARGUMENT.,"The glancing birds beneath the castle sing,"
12262,ARGUMENT.,"And the sole sun his rising orb displays,"
12263,ARGUMENT.,"Radiant and reddening, through the scattered haze."
12264,ARGUMENT.,"To recreate the languid sense a while,"
12265,ARGUMENT.,"When earth and ocean wore their sweetest smile,                  140"
12266,ARGUMENT.,He wandered to the beach: the early air
12267,ARGUMENT.,"Blew soft, and lifted, as it blew, his hair;"
12268,ARGUMENT.,"Flushed was his cheek; his faded eye, more bright,"
12269,ARGUMENT.,"Shone with a faint but animated light,"
12270,ARGUMENT.,While the soft morning ray seemed to bestow
12271,ARGUMENT.,On his tired mind a transient kindred glow.
12272,ARGUMENT.,"As thus, with shadow stretching o'er the sand,"
12273,ARGUMENT.,"He mused and wandered on the winding strand,"
12274,ARGUMENT.,"At distance tossed upon the tumbling tide,"
12275,ARGUMENT.,A dark and floating substance he espied.                         150
12276,ARGUMENT.,"He stood, and where the eddying surges beat,"
12277,ARGUMENT.,An Indian corse was rolled beneath his feet:
12278,ARGUMENT.,The hollow wave retired with sullen sound;
12279,ARGUMENT.,The face of that sad corse was to the ground;
12280,ARGUMENT.,"It seemed a female, by the slender form;"
12281,ARGUMENT.,He touched the hand--it was no longer warm;
12282,ARGUMENT.,"He turned its face--O God! that eye, though dim,"
12283,ARGUMENT.,Seemed with its deadly glare as fixed on him!
12284,ARGUMENT.,"How sunk his shuddering sense, how changed his hue,"
12285,ARGUMENT.,When poor Olola in that corse he knew!                           160
12286,ARGUMENT.,"Lautaro, rushing from the rocks, advanced;"
12287,ARGUMENT.,"His keen eye, like a startled eagle's glanced:"
12288,ARGUMENT.,'Tis she!--he knew her by a mark impressed
12289,ARGUMENT.,From earliest infancy beneath her breast.
12290,ARGUMENT.,"Oh, my poor sister! when all hopes were past"
12291,ARGUMENT.,"Of meeting, do we meet--thus meet--at last!"
12292,ARGUMENT.,"Then full on Zarinel, as one amazed,"
12293,ARGUMENT.,With rising wrath and stern suspicion gazed;
12294,ARGUMENT.,"For Zarinel still knelt upon the sand,"
12295,ARGUMENT.,And to his forehead pressed the dead maid's hand.                170
12296,ARGUMENT.,Speak! whence art thou?
12297,ARGUMENT.,"Pale Zarinel, his head"
12298,ARGUMENT.,"Upraising answered,"
12299,ARGUMENT.,Peace is with the dead!
12300,ARGUMENT.,Him dost thou seek who injured thine and thee?
12301,ARGUMENT.,Here--strike the fell assassin--I am he!
12302,ARGUMENT.,"Die! he exclaimed, and with convulsive start"
12303,ARGUMENT.,"Instant had plunged the dagger in his heart,"
12304,ARGUMENT.,"When the meek father, with his holy book,"
12305,ARGUMENT.,"And placid aspect, met his frenzied look.                        180"
12306,ARGUMENT.,"He trembled--struck his brow--and, turning round,"
12307,ARGUMENT.,Flung the uplifted dagger to the ground.
12308,ARGUMENT.,"Then murmured: Father, Heaven has heard thy prayer--"
12309,ARGUMENT.,But oh! the sister of my soul lies there!
12310,ARGUMENT.,"The Christian's God has triumphed! father, heap"
12311,ARGUMENT.,"Some earth upon her bones, whilst I go weep!"
12312,ARGUMENT.,"Anselmo with calm brow approached the place,"
12313,ARGUMENT.,And hastened with his staff his faltering pace:
12314,ARGUMENT.,"Ho! child of guilt and wretchedness, he cried,"
12315,ARGUMENT.,"Speak!--Holy father, the sad youth replied,                      190"
12316,ARGUMENT.,God bade the seas the accusing victim roll
12317,ARGUMENT.,"Dead at my feet, to teach my shuddering soul"
12318,ARGUMENT.,"Its guilt: Oh! father, holy father, pray"
12319,ARGUMENT.,"That heaven may take the deep, dire curse away!"
12320,ARGUMENT.,"Oh! yet, Anselmo cried, live and repent,"
12321,ARGUMENT.,For not in vain was this dread warning sent;
12322,ARGUMENT.,"The deep reproaches of thy soul I spare,"
12323,ARGUMENT.,Go! seek Heaven's peace by penitence and prayer.
12324,ARGUMENT.,"The youth arose, yet trembling from the shock,"
12325,ARGUMENT.,And severed from the dead maid's hair a lock;                    200
12326,ARGUMENT.,"This to his heart with trembling hand he pressed,"
12327,ARGUMENT.,And dried the salt-sea moisture on his breast.
12328,ARGUMENT.,"They laid her limbs within the sea-beat grave,"

12485,ARGUMENT.,The glittering file its bannered length displays;
12486,ARGUMENT.,"Now winding from the woods, again appears"
12487,ARGUMENT.,The moving line of matchlocks and of spears.
12488,ARGUMENT.,"Part seen, part lost; the long illustrious march"
12489,ARGUMENT.,"Circling the swamp, now draws its various arch;"
12490,ARGUMENT.,"And seems, as on it moves, meandering slow,"

12503,ARGUMENT.,The troops a moment half-recoiling stood.
12504,ARGUMENT.,"But boots not now to pause, or to retire;"
12505,ARGUMENT.,Valdivia's eye flashed with indignant fire:
12506,ARGUMENT.,"Follow! he cried, brave comrades, to the hill!"
12507,ARGUMENT.,And instant shouts the pealing valley fill.
12508,ARGUMENT.,"And now, up to the hill's ascending crest,"
12509,ARGUMENT.,"With animated look and beating breast,"
12510,ARGUMENT.,"He urged his steed; when, wide beneath his eye,"

12525,ARGUMENT.,"From forests, brown with everlasting shades;"
12526,ARGUMENT.,"From rocks of sunshine, white with prone cascades;"
12527,ARGUMENT.,"From snowy summits, where the Llama roams,"
12528,ARGUMENT.,Oft bending o'er the cataract as it foams;
12529,ARGUMENT.,From streams whose bridges[229] tremble from the steep;
12530,ARGUMENT.,"From lakes, in summer's sweetest light asleep;"

12532,ARGUMENT.,"With clubs terrific, and with aspects grim,                      190"
12533,ARGUMENT.,Flocked fearless.
12534,ARGUMENT.,When they saw the Spanish line
12535,ARGUMENT.,"Arrayed, and front to front, descending shine,"

12537,ARGUMENT.,(Ten thousand spears uplifted to the sky)--
12538,ARGUMENT.,"Tyrants, we come to conquer or to die!"

12540,ARGUMENT.,"A-left; and, rushing to the foremost horse,"
12541,ARGUMENT.,"Hurled with unerring aim the involving thong,"
12542,ARGUMENT.,Then fearless sprang amidst the mailed throng.                   200
12543,ARGUMENT.,"Valdivia saw the horse, entangled, reel,"
12544,ARGUMENT.,"And shouting, as he rode, Castile! Castile!"
12545,ARGUMENT.,"Led on the charge: like a descending flood,"
12546,ARGUMENT.,"It swept, till every spur was black with blood."
12547,ARGUMENT.,"His force a-right, where Harratomac led,"
12548,ARGUMENT.,"A thousand spears went hissing overhead,"
12549,ARGUMENT.,"And feathered arrows, of each varying hue,"
12550,ARGUMENT.,"In glancing arch, beneath the sunbeams flew."
12551,ARGUMENT.,"Dire was the strife, when ardent Teucapel"
12552,ARGUMENT.,Advancing in the front of carnage fell.                          210
12553,ARGUMENT.,"At once, Ongolmo, Elicura, rushed,"
12554,ARGUMENT.,"And swaying their huge clubs together, crushed"
12555,ARGUMENT.,"Horseman and horse; then bathed their hands in gore,"
12556,ARGUMENT.,And limb from limb the panting carcase tore.
12557,ARGUMENT.,"Caupolican, where the main battle bleeds,"
12558,ARGUMENT.,"Hosts and succeeding hosts undaunted leads,"
12559,ARGUMENT.,"Till, torn and shattered by the ceaseless fire,"
12560,ARGUMENT.,"Thousands, with gnashing teeth, and clenched spears, expire."
12561,ARGUMENT.,"Pierced by a hundred wounds, Ongolmo lies,"
12562,ARGUMENT.,And grasps his club terrific as he dies.                         220
12563,ARGUMENT.,"With breathless expectation, on the height,"
12564,ARGUMENT.,Lautaro watched the long and dubious fight:
12565,ARGUMENT.,"Pale and resigned the meek man stood, and pressed"
12566,ARGUMENT.,More close the holy image to his breast.
12567,ARGUMENT.,"Now nearer to the fight Lautaro drew,"
12568,ARGUMENT.,"When on the ground a warrior met his view,"
12569,ARGUMENT.,Upon whose features memory seemed to trace
12570,ARGUMENT.,A faint resemblance of his father's face;
12571,ARGUMENT.,"O'er him a horseman, with collected might,"
12572,ARGUMENT.,"Raised his uplifted sword, in act to smite,                      230"
12573,ARGUMENT.,"When the youth springing on, without a word,"
12574,ARGUMENT.,"Snatched from a soldier's wearied grasp his sword,"
12575,ARGUMENT.,And smote the horseman through the crest: a yell
12576,ARGUMENT.,"Of triumph burst, as to the ground he fell."
12577,ARGUMENT.,"Lautaro{k} shouted, On! brave brothers, on!"
12578,ARGUMENT.,Scatter them like the snow!--the day is won!

12580,ARGUMENT.,"The Indians turn: again the battle bleeds,"
12581,ARGUMENT.,Cleft are the helms and crushed the struggling steeds.
12582,ARGUMENT.,"The bugle sounds, and faint with toil and heat,                  240"
12583,ARGUMENT.,Some straggling horsemen to the hills retreat.
12584,ARGUMENT.,"Stand, brave companions! bold Valdivia cried,"
12585,ARGUMENT.,"And shook his sword, in recent carnage dyed;"
12586,ARGUMENT.,Oh! droop not--droop not yet--all is not o'er--
12587,ARGUMENT.,"Brave, faithful friends, one glorious sally more."
12588,ARGUMENT.,Where is Lautaro! leaps his willing sword
12589,ARGUMENT.,Now to avenge his long-indulgent lord!
12590,ARGUMENT.,"He waited not for answer, but again"
12591,ARGUMENT.,Spurred to the centre of the horrid plain.
12592,ARGUMENT.,"Clubs, arrows, spears, the spot of death inclose,                250"
12593,ARGUMENT.,And fainter now the Spanish shouts arose.

12597,ARGUMENT.,"Vain is the fiery tube, the twisted mail!"
12598,ARGUMENT.,"The Spanish horsemen faint; long yells resound,"
12599,ARGUMENT.,As the dragged ensign trails the gory ground:
12600,ARGUMENT.,"Shout, for the chief is seized!--a thousand cries"
12601,ARGUMENT.,Burst forth--Valdivia! for the sacrifice!
12602,ARGUMENT.,"And lo, in silent dignity resigned,                              260"
12603,ARGUMENT.,"The meek Anselmo, led in bonds, behind!"
12604,ARGUMENT.,"His hand upon his breast, young Zarinel"
12605,ARGUMENT.,Amidst a group of mangled Indians fell;
12606,ARGUMENT.,The spear that to his heart a passage found
12607,ARGUMENT.,Left poor Olola's hair within the wound.
12608,ARGUMENT.,"Now all is hushed, save where, at times, alone,"
12609,ARGUMENT.,Deep midnight listens to a distant moan;
12610,ARGUMENT.,"Save where the condors clamour, overhead,"

12741,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"This humble man, with kind parental care,"
12742,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Snatched me from slavery--saved from dark despair;
12743,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And as my years increased, protected, fed,                        90"
12744,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,And breathed a father's blessings on my head.
12745,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,A Spanish maid was with him: need I speak?
12746,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Behold, affection's tear still wets my cheek!"
12747,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Years, as they passed, matured in ripening grace"

12749,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"She heard my orphan tale; she loved to hear,"

12751,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"I could have bowed to direst ills resigned,"
12752,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"But wept at looks so sweet, at words so kind."
12753,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Valdivia saw me, now in blooming age,                          100"
12754,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,And claimed me from the father as his page;
12755,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"The chief too cherished me, yea, saved my life,"
12756,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,When in Peru arose the civil strife.
12757,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Yet still remembering her I loved so well,"
12758,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Oft I returned to the gray father's cell:
12759,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,His voice instructed me; recalled my youth
12760,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,From rude idolatry to heavenly truth:
12761,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Of this hereafter; he my darkling mind
12762,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Cleared, and from low and sensual thoughts refined."
12763,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Then first, with feelings new impressed, I strove                110"
12764,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,To hide the tear of tenderness and love:
12765,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Amid the fairest maidens of Peru,"
12766,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"My eyes, my heart, one only object knew:"
12767,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,I lived that object's love and faith to share;
12768,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"He saw, and blessed us with a father's prayer."
12769,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Here, at Valdivia's last and stern command,"
12770,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"I came, a stranger in my native land!"
12771,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Anselmo (so him call--now most in need--

12773,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Came, by our chief so summoned, and for aid                      120"
12774,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,To the Great Spirit of the Christians prayed:
12775,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Here as a son I loved him, but I left"
12776,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"A wife, a child, of my fond cares bereft,"
12777,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Never to see again; for death awaits
12778,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,My entrance now in Lima's jealous gates.
12779,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Caupolican, didst thou thy father love?"
12780,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Did his last dying look affection move?
12781,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Pity this aged man; unbend thy brow:
12782,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"He was my father--is my father, now!"
12783,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Consenting mercy marks each warrior's mien.                    130
12784,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"But who is this, what pallid form is seen,"
12785,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"As crushed already by the fatal blow,"
12786,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Bound, and with looks white as a wreath of snow,"
12787,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Her hands upon her breast, scarce drawn her breath,"
12788,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"A Spanish woman knelt, expecting death,"

12791,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Lautaro started:
12792,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Injured maid of Spain!
12793,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Me!--me! oh, take me to thine arms again!                        140"
12794,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"She heard his voice, and, by the scene oppressed,"
12795,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,With one faint sigh fell senseless on his breast.
12796,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Caupolican, with warm emotion, cried,"
12797,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Live, live! Lautaro and his beauteous bride!"
12798,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Live, aged father!--and forthwith commands"
12799,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,A warrior to unbind Anselmo's hands.
12800,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"She raised her head: his eyes first met her view,"
12801,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"As round Lautaro's neck her arms she threw,"
12802,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Ah, no! she feebly spoke; it is not true!"
12803,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,It is some form of the distempered brain!                        150
12804,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Then hid her face upon his breast again.
12805,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Dark flashing eyes, terrific, glared around:"
12806,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Here, his brains scattered by the deadly wound,"
12807,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,The Spanish chief lay on the gory ground.
12808,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"With lowering brows, and mace yet drooping blood,"
12809,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And clotted hair, there Mariantu stood."
12810,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Anselmo here, sad, yet in sorrow mild,"
12811,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Appeared: she cried, A blessing on your child,"
12812,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And knelt, as slow revived her waking sense,"
12813,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And then, with looks aghast, Oh bear us hence!                   160"
12814,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Now all the assembled chiefs, assenting, cried,"
12815,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Live, live! Lautaro and his beauteous bride!"
12816,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"With eager arms Lautaro snatched his boy,"
12817,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,And kissed him in an agony of joy;
12818,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Then to Anselmo gave, who strove to speak,"
12819,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,And felt the tear first burning on his cheek:
12820,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"The infant held his neck with strict embrace,"
12821,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,And kissed his pale emaciated face.
12822,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"From the dread scene, wet with Valdivia's gore,"
12823,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,His wan and trembling charge Lautaro bore.                       170
12824,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"There was a bank, where slept the summer-light,"
12825,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"A small stream whispering went in mazes bright,"
12826,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And stealing from the sea, the western wind"
12827,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Waved the magnolias on the slope inclined:
12828,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"The woodpecker, in glittering plumage green,"
12829,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And echoing bill, beneath the boughs was seen;"
12830,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And, arched with gay and pendent flowers above,"
12831,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,The floripondio[230] its rich trellis wove.
12832,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Lautaro bent, with looks of love and joy,"
12833,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,O'er his yet trembling wife and beauteous boy:                   180
12834,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Oh, by what miracle, beloved! say,"
12835,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Hast thou escaped the perils of the way
12836,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"From Lima, where our humble dwelling stood,"
12837,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"To these tumultuous scenes, this vale of blood?"
12838,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Roused by his voice, as from the sleep of death,"
12839,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Faint she replied, with slow-recovering breath,"
12840,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Who shall express, when thou, best friend! wert gone,"
12841,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,How sunk my heart!--deserted and alone!
12842,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Would I were with thee! oft I sat and sighed,"
12843,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,When the pale moon shone on the silent tide--                    190
12844,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"At length resolved, I sought thee o'er the seas:"
12845,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"The brave bark cheer'ly went before the breeze,"
12846,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"That arms and soldiers to Valdivia bore,"
12847,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,From Lima bound to Chili's southern shore:
12848,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"I seized the fair occasion--ocean smiled,"
12849,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,As to the sire I bore his lisping child.
12850,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,The storm arose: with loud and sudden shock
12851,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"The vessel sunk, disparting on a rock."
12852,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Some mariners, amidst the billows wild,"
12853,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Scarce saved, in one small boat, me and my child.                200"
12854,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"What I have borne, a captive since that day--"
12855,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Forgive these tears--I scarce have heart to say!
12856,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"None pitied, save one gentle Indian maid--"
12857,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,A wild maid--of her looks I was afraid;
12858,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Her long black hair upon her shoulders fell,"
12859,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,And in her hand she bore a wreathed shell.
12860,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Lautaro for a moment turned aside,"
12861,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And, Oh, my sister! with faint voice he cried."
12862,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Already free from sorrow and alarms,"

12866,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Before me stood, and lifting high his lance,"
12867,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Exclaimed: No further, on thy life, advance!"
12868,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Faint, wearied, sinking to the earth with dread,"
12869,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,Back to the dismal cave my steps he led.
12870,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Only at eve, within the craggy cleft,"
12871,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Some water, and a cake of maize, were left."
12872,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,The thirteenth sun unseen went down the sky;

12879,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"And truth and tenderness, Lautaro strove"
12880,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"To calm her wounded heart; the holy sire,"
12881,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"His eyes faint-lighted with a transient fire,"
12882,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"Hung o'er them, and to Heaven his prayer addressed,"
12883,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"While, with uplifted hands, he wept and blest.                   230"
12884,SONG OF INDIAN MAIDS.,"An aged Indian came, with feathers crowned,"

12896,INDIAN.,"Friend of my infant days, how I rejoice,                       240"
12897,INDIAN.,"Lautaro cried, once more to hear that voice!"

12903,INDIAN.,"I come to guide thee through untrodden ways,"
12904,INDIAN.,"To the lone valley, where thy father's days"

12906,INDIAN.,"From morn to morn, reminded him of thee!"
12907,INDIAN.,"Lautaro cried: Here, faithful Indian, stay;"
12908,INDIAN.,I have a last sad duty yet to pay.
12909,INDIAN.,A little while we part:--thou here remain.                       250
12910,INDIAN.,"He spake, and passed like lightning o'er the plain."
12911,INDIAN.,"Ah, cease, Castilian maid, thy vain alarms!"
12912,INDIAN.,See where he comes--his father in his arms!
12913,INDIAN.,"Now lead, he cried. The Indian, sad and still,"
12914,INDIAN.,"Paced on from wood to vale, from vale to hill;"
12915,INDIAN.,"Her infant tired, and hushed a while to rest,"
12916,INDIAN.,"Smiled, in a dream, upon its mother's breast;"
12917,INDIAN.,The pensive mother gray Anselmo led;

12919,INDIAN.,Beneath the branching palms they slept at night;               260
12920,INDIAN.,The small birds waked them ere the morning light.
12921,INDIAN.,"Before their path, in distant view, appeared"
12922,INDIAN.,"The mountain-smoke, that its dark column reared"
12923,INDIAN.,"O'er Andes' summits, in the pale blue sky,"
12924,INDIAN.,Lifting their icy pinnacles so high.
12925,INDIAN.,Four days they onward held their eastern way;
12926,INDIAN.,"On the fifth rising morn, before them lay"
12927,INDIAN.,"Chillan's lone glen, amid whose windings green,"
12928,INDIAN.,The Warrior's loved and last abode was seen.
12929,INDIAN.,"No smoke went up, a stillness reigned around,                    270"
12930,INDIAN.,"Save where the waters fell with soothing sound,"
12931,INDIAN.,"Save where the Thenca sang so loud and clear,"
12932,INDIAN.,And the bright humming-bird was spinning near.
12933,INDIAN.,"Yet here all human tumults seemed to cease,"
12934,INDIAN.,And sunshine rested on the spot of peace;
12935,INDIAN.,The myrtles bloomed as fragrant and as green
12936,INDIAN.,As if Lautaro scarce had left the scene;
12937,INDIAN.,And in his ear the falling waters' spray
12938,INDIAN.,Seemed swelling with the sounds of yesterday.
12939,INDIAN.,"Where yonder rock the aged cedars shade,                       280"
12940,INDIAN.,There shall my father's bones in peace be laid.
12941,INDIAN.,Beneath the cedar's shade they dug the ground;
12942,INDIAN.,The small and sad communion gathered round.
12943,INDIAN.,"Beside the grave stood aged Izdabel,"
12944,INDIAN.,"And broke the spear, and cried: Farewell, farewell!"
12945,INDIAN.,"Lautaro hid his face, and sighed Adieu!"
12946,INDIAN.,As the stone hatchet in the grave he threw.
12947,INDIAN.,"The little child that to its mother clung,"
12948,INDIAN.,"Stretched out its arm, then on her garment hung,"
12949,INDIAN.,"With sidelong looks, half-shrinking, half-amazed,                290"
12950,INDIAN.,"And dropped its flowers, unconscious, as it gazed."
12951,INDIAN.,"And now Anselmo, his pale brow inclined,"
12952,INDIAN.,"The honoured relics, dust to dust, consigned"
12953,INDIAN.,"With Christian rites, and sung, on bending knee,"
12954,INDIAN.,"""Eternam pacem dona, Domine."""
12955,INDIAN.,Then rising up he closed the holy book;
12956,INDIAN.,"And lifting in the beam his lighted look,"
12957,INDIAN.,"(The cross, with meekness, folded on his breast),"
12958,INDIAN.,"Here, too, he cried, my bones in peace shall rest!"
12959,INDIAN.,"Few years remain to me, and never more                           300"
12960,INDIAN.,"Shall I behold, O Spain! thy distant shore!"
12961,INDIAN.,"Here lay my bones, that the same tree may wave"
12962,INDIAN.,O'er the poor Christian's and the Indian's grave.
12963,INDIAN.,"Oh, may it (when the sons of future days"

12965,INDIAN.,"Oh, may it teach, that charity should bind,"
12966,INDIAN.,"Where'er they roam, the brothers of mankind!"
12967,INDIAN.,"The time shall come, when wildest tribes shall hear"
12968,INDIAN.,"Thy voice, O Christ! and drop the slaughtering spear."
12969,INDIAN.,"Yet we condemn not him who bravely stood,                      310"
12970,INDIAN.,To seal his country's freedom with his blood;
12971,INDIAN.,"And if, in after-times, a ruthless band"
