445,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},I was seated at my father's board
446,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},With dogs and whelps amused;
447,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Towards me striding my stepmother came,"
448,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},And cruelly me she used.
449,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
450,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"She changed me to a little hind,"
451,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},Bade me into the forest wend;
452,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"My seven maids then she changed to wolves,"
453,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},And ordered them my flesh to rend.
454,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
455,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"But my seven maids would rend me not,"
456,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},So dearly me they loved;
457,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Then vexed sore my step-dame was,"
458,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},That no worse my fortune proved.
459,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
460,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Sir Orm he serves in the King's palace,"
461,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},A Knight is he so fair;
462,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"He sighs for the maiden day and night,"
463,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},But in secret he keeps his care.
464,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
465,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Sir Orm he rode from the King's palace,"
466,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},He could enjoy no peace;
467,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"He rode into the good green wood,"
468,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},The hart and hind to chase.
469,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
470,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Sir Orm set his bow his knee before,"
471,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},He rode to the hind so near;
472,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"But the hind would not from the sleuth-hounds flee,"
473,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},For the Knight to her was dear.
474,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
475,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"But the hounds advanced to the hind so near,"
476,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},That the hind was forced to fly;
477,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"She changed herself to a little bird,"
478,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},And flew high up in the sky.
479,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
480,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Anon down flew the little bird,"
481,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},Perched a linden bough upon;
482,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Sir Orm he stood there down below,"
483,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},And sorely did he moan.
484,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
485,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Down flew the lovely little bird,"
486,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"And 'gan on the bait to feast,"
487,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Which out of his bosom Sir Orm had cut,"
488,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},So well it pleased her taste.
489,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
490,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},And then the lovely little bird
491,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Dropped down on the yellow sand,"
492,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"And she became the fairest damsel,"
493,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},Was ever seen in the land.
494,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
495,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"The Damsel stood under the linden bough,"
496,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},Freed was she now from thrall;
497,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Sir Orm he stood so near thereby,"
498,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},They related their sorrows all.
499,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
500,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"""Many thanks to thee, Sir Orm the bold"
501,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},Thou'st freed me from my woe;
502,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},Except beside my snow-white side
503,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Thou sleep shalt nevermoe."""
504,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},
505,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},"Thanks be to him, Sir Orm the bold"
506,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},He kept his faith so well;
507,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},The Monday morn thereafter
508,THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL. {25},His bridal it befell.
