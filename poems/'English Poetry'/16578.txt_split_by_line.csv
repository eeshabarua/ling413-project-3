69,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',At the hole where he went in
70,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin.
71,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Hear what little Red-Eye saith:
72,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Nag, come up and dance with death!'"
73,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
74,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Eye to eye and head to head,"
75,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"(_Keep the measure, Nag_.)"
76,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',This shall end when one is dead;
77,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"(_At thy pleasure, Nag_.)"
78,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Turn for turn and twist for twist--
79,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"(_Run and hide thee, Nag_.)"
80,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Hah! The hooded Death has missed!
81,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"(_Woe betide thee, Nag!_)"
82,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
83,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought
84,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee"
85,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"cantonment. Darzee, the tailor-bird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the"
86,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"musk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but"
87,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"always creeps round by the wall, gave him advice; but Rikki-tikki did"
88,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',the real fighting.
89,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
90,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail,"
91,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',but quite like a weasel in his head and habits. His eyes and the end
92,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',of his restless nose were pink; he could scratch himself anywhere he
93,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"pleased, with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use; he could"
94,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle-brush, and his"
95,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"war-cry, as he scuttled through the long grass, was:"
96,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','_Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!_'
97,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
98,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"One day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he"
99,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"lived with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and"
100,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"clucking, down a roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass"
101,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"floating there, and clung to it till he lost his senses. When he"
102,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"revived, he was lying in the hot sun on the middle of a garden path,"
103,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"very draggled indeed, and a small boy was saying: 'Here's a dead"
104,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',mongoose. Let's have a funeral.'
105,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
106,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'No,' said his mother; 'let's take him in and dry him. Perhaps he"
107,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',isn't really dead.'
108,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
109,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"They took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his"
110,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"finger and thumb, and said he was not dead but half choked; so they"
111,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"wrapped him in cotton-wool, and warmed him and he opened his eyes and"
112,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',sneezed.
113,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
114,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Now,' said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into"
115,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',the bungalow); 'don't frighten him and we'll see what he'll do.'
116,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
117,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because"
118,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all the
119,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',mongoose family is 'Run and find out'; and Rikki-tikki was a true
120,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"mongoose. He looked at the cotton-wool, decided that it was not good"
121,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"to eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order,"
122,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"scratched himself, and jumped on the small boy's shoulder."
123,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
124,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Don't be frightened, Teddy,' said his father. 'That's his way of"
125,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',making friends.'
126,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
127,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Ouch! He's tickling under my chin,' said Teddy."
128,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
129,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki looked down between the boy's collar and neck, snuffed at"
130,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"his ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his"
131,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',nose.
132,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
133,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Good gracious,' said Teddy's mother, 'and that's a wild creature! I"
134,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',suppose he's so tame because we've been kind to him.'
135,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
136,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'All mongooses are like that,' said her husband. 'If Teddy doesn't"
137,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"pick him up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage,  he'll run in"
138,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',and out of the house all day long. Let's give him something to eat.'
139,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
140,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',They gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki tikki liked it
141,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"immensely, and when it was finished he went out into the verandah and"
142,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',sat in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the
143,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',roots. Then he felt better.
144,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
145,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'There are more things to find out about in this house,' he said to"
146,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"himself, 'than all my family could find out in all their lives. I"
147,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',shall certainly stay and find out.'
148,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
149,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',He spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned
150,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"himself in the bath tubs, put his nose into the ink on a"
151,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"writing-table, and burnt it on the end of the big man's cigar, for he"
152,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',climbed up in the big man's lap to see how writing was done. At
153,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',nightfall he ran into Teddy's nursery to watch how the kerosene-lamps
154,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"were lighted, and when Teddy went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too;"
155,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"but he was a restless companion, because he had to get up and attend"
156,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"to every noise all through the night, and find out what made it."
157,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Teddy's mother and father came in, the last thing, to look at their"
158,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on the pillow. 'I don't like that,'"
159,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',said Teddy's mother; 'he may bite the child.' 'He'll do no such
160,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"thing,' said the father. 'Teddy's safer with that little beast than"
161,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake came into the nursery
162,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',now----'
163,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
164,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',But Teddy's mother wouldn't think of anything so awful.
165,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
166,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Early in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast-in the
167,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"verandah riding on Teddy's shoulder, and they gave him banana and"
168,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"some boiled egg; and he sat on all their laps one after the other,"
169,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',because every well-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a
170,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"house-mongoose some day and have rooms to run about in, and"
171,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki's mother (she used to live in the General's house at
172,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what to do if ever he came across
173,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',white men.
174,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
175,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Then Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen.
176,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"It was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes as big as"
177,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"summer-houses of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of"
178,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"bamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips."
179,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'This is a splendid hunting-ground,' he said, and his tail grew"
180,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"bottle-brushy at the thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the"
181,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"garden, snuffing here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices"
182,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',in a thorn-bush.
183,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
184,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"It was Darzee, the tailor-bird, and his wife. They had made a"
185,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',beautiful nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them
186,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"up the edges with fibres, and had filled the hollow with cotton and"
187,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"downy fluff. The nest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and"
188,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',cried.
189,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
190,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','What is the matter?' asked Rikki-tikki.
191,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
192,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'We are very miserable,' said Darzee. 'One of our babies fell out of"
193,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the nest yesterday, and Nag ate him.'"
194,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
195,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'H'm!' said Rikki-tikki, 'that is very sad--but I am a stranger here."
196,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Who is Nag?'
197,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
198,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering,"
199,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low
200,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',hiss--a horrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear
201,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',feet. Then inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread
202,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"hood of Nag, the big black cobra, and he was five feet long from"
203,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',tongue to tail. When he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the
204,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"ground, he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion-tuft"
205,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"balances in the wind, and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked"
206,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"snake's eyes that never change their expression, whatever the snake"
207,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',may be thinking of.
208,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
209,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Who is Nag?' said he. '_I_ am Nag. The great god Brahm put his mark
210,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',upon all our people when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the
211,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"sun off Brahm as he slept. Look, and be afraid!'"
212,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
213,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"He spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the"
214,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',spectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part
215,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',of a hook-and-eye fastening. He was afraid for the minute; but it is
216,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time,"
217,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"and though Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his mother"
218,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"had fed him on dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongoose's"
219,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"business in life was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too, and"
220,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',at the bottom of his cold heart he was afraid.
221,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
222,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Well,' said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again,"
223,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'marks or no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat"
224,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',fledglings out of a nest?'
225,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
226,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement"
227,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',in the grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden
228,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"meant death sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to"
229,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"get Rikki-tikki off his guard. So he dropped his head a little, and"
230,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',put it on one side.
231,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
232,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Let us talk,' he said. 'You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?'"
233,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
234,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Behind you! Look behind you!' sang Darzee.
235,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
236,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He jumped up
237,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"in the air as high as he could go, and just under him whizzed by the"
238,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"head of Nagaina, Nag's wicked wife. She had crept up behind him as he"
239,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"was talking, to make an end of him; and he heard her savage hiss as"
240,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the stroke missed. He came down almost across her back, and if he had"
241,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',been an old mongoose he would have known that then was the time to
242,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',break her back with one bite; but he was afraid of the terrible
243,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"lashing return-stroke of the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite"
244,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"long enough, and he jumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving"
245,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Nagaina torn and angry.
246,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
247,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Wicked, wicked Darzee!' said Nag, lashing up as high as he could"
248,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',reach toward the nest in the thorn-bush; but Darzee had built it out
249,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"of reach of snakes, and it only swayed to and fro."
250,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
251,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes
252,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs"
253,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"like a little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with"
254,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass. When a
255,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"snake misses its stroke, it never says anything or gives any sign of"
256,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"what it means to do next. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them,"
257,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes at once. So
258,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"he trotted off to the gravel path near the house, and sat down to"
259,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',think. It was a serious matter for him.
260,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
261,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"If you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say"
262,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten, he"
263,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',runs off and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true. The
264,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of
265,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"foot,--snake's blow against mongoose's jump,--and as no eye can"
266,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"follow the motion of a snake's head when it strikes, that makes"
267,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',things much more wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he
268,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"was a young mongoose, and it made him all the more pleased to think"
269,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',that he had managed to escape a blow from behind. It gave him
270,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"confidence in himself, and when Teddy came running down the path,"
271,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.
272,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
273,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"But just as Teddy was stooping, something flinched a little in the"
274,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"dust, and a tiny voice said: 'Be careful. I am death!' It was Karait,"
275,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',the dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth;
276,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',and his bite is as dangerous as the cobra's. But he is so small that
277,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"nobody thinks of him, and so he does the more harm to people."
278,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
279,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki's eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with"
280,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the peculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his"
281,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"family. It looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait"
282,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',that you can fly off from it at any angle you please; and in dealing
283,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"with snakes this is an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he"
284,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"was doing a much more dangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait"
285,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"is so small, and can turn so quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close"
286,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"to the back of the head, he would get the return-stroke in his eye or"
287,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"lip. But Rikki did not know: his eyes were all red, and he rocked"
288,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"back and forth, looking for a good place to hold. Karait struck out."
289,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki jumped sideways and tried to run in, but the wicked little"
290,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"dusty gray head lashed within a fraction of his shoulder, and he had"
291,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"to jump over the body, and the head followed his heels close."
292,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
293,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Teddy shouted to the house: 'Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a"
294,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',snake'; and Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy's mother. His
295,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"father ran out with a stick, but by the time he came up, Karait had"
296,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"lunged out once too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the"
297,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"snake's back, dropped his head far between his fore-legs, bitten as"
298,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"high up the back as he could get hold, and rolled away. That bite"
299,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"paralysed Karait, and Rikki-tikki was just going to eat him up from"
300,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the tail, after the custom of his family at dinner, when he"
301,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"remembered that a full meal makes a slow mongoose, and if he wanted"
302,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"all his strength and quickness ready, he must keep himself thin."
303,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
304,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"He went away for a dust-bath under the castor-oil bushes, while"
305,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Teddy's father beat the dead Karait. 'What is the use of that?'
306,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',thought Rikki-tikki. 'I have settled it all'; and then Teddy's mother
307,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"picked him up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he had saved"
308,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Teddy from death, and Teddy's father said that he was a providence,"
309,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',and Teddy looked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather
310,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"amused at all the fuss, which, of course, he did not understand."
311,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Teddy's mother might just as well have petted Teddy for playing in
312,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',the dust. Rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself.
313,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
314,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"That night, at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on"
315,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the table, he could have stuffed himself three times over with nice"
316,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"things; but he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very"
317,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"pleasant to be patted and petted by Teddy's mother, and to sit on"
318,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Teddy's shoulder, his eyes would get red from time to time, and he"
319,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',would go off into his long war cry of '_Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!_'
320,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
321,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Teddy carried him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping"
322,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"under his chin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but"
323,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',as soon as Teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round
324,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the house, and in the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the"
325,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"musk-rat, creeping round by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted"
326,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"little beast, He whimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make up"
327,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"his mind to run into the middle of the room, but he never gets there."
328,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
329,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Don't kill me,' said Chuchundra, almost weeping. 'Rikki-tikki, don't"
330,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',kill me.'
331,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
332,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Do you  think a snake-killer kills musk-rats?' said Rikki-tikki
333,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',scornfully.
334,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
335,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes,' said Chuchundra, more"
336,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',sorrowfully than ever. 'And how am I to be sure that Nag won't
337,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',mistake me for you some dark night?'
338,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
339,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'There's not the least danger,' said Rikki-tikki; 'but Nag is in the"
340,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"garden, and I know you don't go there.'"
341,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
342,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'My cousin Chua, the rat, told me----' said Chuchundra, and then he"
343,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',stopped.
344,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
345,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Told you what?'
346,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
347,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'H'sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua"
348,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',in the garden.'
349,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
350,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'I didn't--so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I'll bite you!'"
351,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
352,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers.
353,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'I am a very poor man,' he sobbed. 'I never had spirit enough to run"
354,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',out into the middle of the room. H'sh! I mustn't tell you anything.
355,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Can't you _hear_, Rikki-tikki?'"
356,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
357,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought"
358,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"he could just catch the faintest _scratch-scratch_ in the world,--a"
359,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"noise as faint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane,--the dry"
360,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',scratch of a snake's scales on brickwork.
361,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
362,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'That's Nag or Nagaina,' he said to himself; 'and he's crawling into"
363,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should have talked"
364,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',to Chua.'
365,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
366,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"He stole off to Teddy's bath-room, but there was nothing there, and"
367,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',then to Teddy's mother's bath-room. At the bottom of the smooth
368,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',plaster wall there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the
369,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"bath-water, and as Rikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the"
370,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"bath is put, he heard Nag and Nagaina whispering together outside in"
371,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',the moonlight.
372,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
373,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'When the house is emptied of people,' said Nagaina to her husband,"
374,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'_he_ will have to go away, and then the garden will be our own"
375,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"again. Go in quietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait"
376,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"is the first one to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt"
377,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',for Rikki-tikki together.'
378,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
379,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the
380,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',people?' said Nag.
381,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
382,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have"
383,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"any mongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are"
384,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',king and queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs
385,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"in the melon-bed hatch (as they may to-morrow), our children will"
386,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',need room and quiet.'
387,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
388,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"I had not thought of that,' said Nag. 'I will go, but there is no"
389,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',need that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the
390,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"big man and his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly."
391,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Then the bungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.'"
392,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
393,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then"
394,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nag's head came through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body"
395,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"followed it. Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he"
396,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"saw the size of the big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his"
397,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"head, and looked into the bath-room in the dark, and Rikki could see"
398,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',his eyes glitter.
399,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
400,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Now, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on"
401,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the open floor, the odds are in his favour. What am I to do?' said"
402,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki-tavi.
403,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
404,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from"
405,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the biggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. 'That is good,'"
406,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"said the snake. 'Now, when Karait was killed, the big man had a"
407,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"stick. He may have that stick still, but when he comes in to bathe in"
408,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',the morning he will not have a stick. I shall wait here till he
409,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',comes. Nagaina--do you hear me?--I shall wait here in the cool till
410,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',daytime.'
411,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
412,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"There was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had"
413,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"gone away. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at"
414,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the bottom of the water-jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death."
415,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"After an hour he began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag"
416,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"was asleep, and Rikki-tikki looked at his big back, wondering which"
417,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',would be the best place for a good hold. 'If I don't break his back
418,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"at the first jump,' said Rikki, 'he can still fight; and if he"
419,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',fights--O Rikki!' He looked at the thickness of the neck below the
420,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"hood, but that was too much for him; and a bite near the tail would"
421,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',only make Nag savage.
422,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
423,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'It must be the head,' he said at last; 'the head above the hood; and"
424,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"when I am once there, I must not let go.'"
425,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
426,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Then he jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water-jar,"
427,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"under the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back"
428,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',against the bulge of the red earthen-rare to hold down the head.
429,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"This gave him just one second's purchase, and he made the most of it."
430,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Then he was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and
431,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"fro on the floor, up and down, and round in great circles; at his"
432,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"eyes were red, and he held on as the body cart-whipped over the"
433,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"floor, upsetting the tin dipper and the soap-dish and the"
434,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"flesh-brush, and banged against the tin side of the bath. As he held"
435,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"he closed his jaws tighter and tighter, for he made sure he would be"
436,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"banged to death, and, for the honour of his family, preferred to be"
437,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy, aching, and felt shaken to"
438,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',pieces when something went off like a thunderclap just behind him; a
439,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"hot wind knocked him senseless, and red fire singed his fur. The man"
440,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"had been wakened by the noise, and had fired both barrels of a"
441,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',shot-gun into Nag just behind the hood.
442,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
443,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he"
444,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"was dead; but the head did not move, and the big man picked him up"
445,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"and said: 'It's the mongoose again, Alice; the little chap has saved"
446,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"_our_ lives now.' Then Teddy's mother came in with a very white face,"
447,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"and saw what was left of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself Teddy's"
448,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',bedroom and spent half the rest of the night shaking  himself
449,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"tenderly to find out whether he really broken into forty pieces, as"
450,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',he fancied.
451,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
452,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"When morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his"
453,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"doings. 'Now I have Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse"
454,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"than five Nags, and there's no knowing when the eggs she spoke of"
455,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"will hatch. Goodness! I must go and see Darzee,' he said."
456,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
457,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Without waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thorn-bush"
458,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',where Darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice.
459,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"The news of Nag's death was all over the garden, for the sweeper had"
460,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',thrown the body on the rubbish-heap.
461,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
462,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!' said Rikki-tikki angrily. 'Is this"
463,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',the time to sing?'
464,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
465,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Nag is dead--is dead--is dead!' sang Darzee. 'The valiant
466,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki caught him by the head and held fast. The big man brought
467,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He will never eat my"
468,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',babies again.'
469,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
470,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'All that's true enough; but where's Nagaina?' said Rikki-tikki,"
471,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',looking carefully round him.
472,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
473,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Nagaina came to the bath-room sluice and called for Nag,' Darzee"
474,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',went on; 'and Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked
475,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',him up on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish-heap. Let
476,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"us sing about the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!' and Darzee filled"
477,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',his throat and sang.
478,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
479,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'If I could get up to your nest, I'd roll all your babies out!' said"
480,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki. 'You don't know when to do the right thing at the right
481,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"time. You're safe enough in your nest there, but it's war for me down"
482,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"here. Stop singing a minute, Darzee.'"
483,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
484,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki's sake I will stop,' said"
485,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Darzee. 'What is it, O killer of the terrible Nag?'"
486,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
487,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Where is Nagaina, for the third time?'"
488,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
489,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'On the rubbish-heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is"
490,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki with the white teeth.'
491,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
492,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her
493,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',eggs?'
494,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
495,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'In the melon-bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes"
496,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',nearly all day. She hid them three weeks ago.'
497,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
498,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the
499,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"wall, you said?'"
500,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
501,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?'"
502,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
503,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will"
504,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"fly off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let"
505,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nagaina chase you away to this bush! I must get to the melon-bed, and"
506,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',if I went there now she'd see me.'
507,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
508,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Darzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more
509,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',than one idea at a time in his head; and just because he knew that
510,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nagaina's children were born in eggs like his own, he didn't think at"
511,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',first that it was fair to kill them. But his wife was a sensible
512,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"bird, and she knew that cobra's eggs meant young cobras later on; so"
513,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"she flew off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm,"
514,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',and continue his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a
515,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',man in some ways.
516,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
517,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"She fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish-heap, and cried out,"
518,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and"
519,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',broke it.' Then she fluttered more desperately than ever.
520,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
521,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nagaina lifted up her head and hissed, 'You warned Rikki-tikki when"
522,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"I would have killed him. Indeed and truly, you've chosen a bad place"
523,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"to be lame in.' And she moved toward Darzee's wife, slipping along"
524,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',over the dust.
525,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
526,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','The boy broke it with a stone!' shrieked Darzee's wife.
527,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
528,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Well! It may be some consolation to you when you're dead to know
529,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',that I shall settle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the
530,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"rubbish-heap this morning, but before night the boy in the house will"
531,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',lie very still. What is the use of running away? I am sure to catch
532,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"you. Little fool, look at me!'"
533,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
534,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Darzee's wife knew better than to do _that_, for a bird who looks at"
535,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',a snake's eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee's wife
536,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and"
537,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Nagaina quickened her pace.
538,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
539,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he"
540,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"raced for the end of the melon-patch near the wall. There, in the"
541,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"warm litter about the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found"
542,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"twenty-five eggs, about the size of a bantam's eggs, but with"
543,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',whitish skin instead of shell.
544,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
545,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'I was not a day too soon,' he said; for he could see the baby cobras"
546,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"curled up inside the skin, and he knew that the minute they were"
547,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',hatched they could each kill a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops
548,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"of the eggs as fast as he could, taking care to crush the young"
549,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"cobras, and turned over the litter from time to time to see whether"
550,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"he had missed any. At last there were only three eggs left, and"
551,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki began to chuckle to himself, when he heard Darzee's wife"
552,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',screaming:
553,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
554,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into"
555,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"the verandah, and--oh, come quickly--she means killing!'"
556,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
557,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed"
558,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"with the third egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the verandah as hard"
559,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',as he could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father
560,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',were there at early breakfast; but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not
561,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"eating anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white."
562,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nagaina was coiled up on the matting by Teddy's chair, within easy"
563,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"striking distance of Teddy's bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro"
564,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',singing a song of triumph.
565,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
566,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Son of the big man that killed Nag,' she hissed, 'stay still. I am"
567,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"not ready yet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three. If you"
568,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"move I strike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people,"
569,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',who killed my Nag!'
570,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
571,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Teddy's eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do"
572,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"was to whisper, 'Sit still, Teddy. You mustn't move. Teddy, keep"
573,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',still.'
574,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
575,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried: 'Turn round, Nagaina; turn and"
576,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',fight!'
577,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
578,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'All in good time,' said she, without moving her eyes. 'I will settle"
579,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"my account with _you_ presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki."
580,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"They are still and white; they are afraid. They dare not move, and if"
581,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',you come a step nearer I strike.'
582,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
583,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Look at your eggs,' said Rikki-tikki, 'in the melon-bed near the"
584,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"wall. Go and look, Nagaina.'"
585,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
586,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"The big snake turned half round, and saw the egg on the verandah."
587,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Ah-h! Give it to me,' she said."
588,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
589,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes"
590,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',were blood-red. 'What price for a snake's egg? For a young cobra? For
591,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',a young king-cobra? For the last--the very last of the brood? The
592,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',ants are eating all the others down by the melon-bed.'
593,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
594,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the"
595,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"one egg; and Rikki-tikki saw Teddy's father shoot out a big hand,"
596,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"catch Teddy by the shoulder, and drag him across the little table"
597,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"with the tea-cups, safe and out of reach of Nagaina."
598,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
599,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI','Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! _Rikk-tck-tck!_' chuckled Rikki-tikki.
600,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'The boy is safe, and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood last"
601,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"night in the bath-room.' Then he began to jump up and down, all four"
602,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"feet together, his head close to the floor. 'He threw me to and fro,"
603,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',but he could not shake me off. He was dead before the big man blew
604,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"him in two. I did it. _Rikki-tikki-tck-tck!_ Come then, Nagaina. Come"
605,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',and fight with me. You shall not be a widow long.'
606,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
607,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the"
608,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"egg lay between Rikki-tikki's paws. 'Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki."
609,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Give me the last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,'"
610,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"she said, lowering her hood."
611,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
612,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back; for you will"
613,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"go to the rubbish-heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone"
614,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',for his gun! Fight!'
615,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
616,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of"
617,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"reach of her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina"
618,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"gathered herself together, and flung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped"
619,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"up and backward. Again and again and again she struck, and each time"
620,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"her head came with a whack on the matting of the verandah, and she"
621,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',gathered herself together like a watch-spring. Then Rikki-tikki
622,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"danced in a circle to get behind her, and Nagaina spun round to keep"
623,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"her head to his head, so that the rustle of her tail on the matting"
624,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind.
625,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
626,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"He had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the verandah, and Nagaina"
627,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"came nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was"
628,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"drawing breath, she caught it in her mouth, turned to the verandah"
629,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"steps and flew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind"
630,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"her. When the cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash"
631,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',flicked across a horse's neck.
632,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
633,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would"
634,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',begin again. She headed straight for the long grass by the
635,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"thorn-bush, and as he was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still"
636,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',singing his foolish little song of triumph. But Darzee's wife was
637,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',wiser. She flew off her nest as Nagaina came along and flapped her
638,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',wings about Nagaina's head. If Darzee had helped they might have
639,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"turned her; but Nagaina only lowered her hood and went on. Still, the"
640,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"instant's delay brought Rikki-tikki up to her, and as she plunged"
641,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"into the rat-hole where she and Nag used to live, his little white"
642,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"teeth were clenched on her tail, and he went down with her--and very"
643,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"few mongooses, however wise and old they may be, care to follow a"
644,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and Rikki-tikki never
645,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to turn and strike
646,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"at him. He held on savagely, and struck out his feet to act as brakes"
647,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"on the dark slope of the hot, moist earth."
648,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
649,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee"
650,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',said: 'It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death-song.
651,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Valiant Rikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him
652,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',underground.'
653,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
654,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',So he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the
655,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"minute, and just as he got to the most touching part the grass"
656,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"quivered again, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself"
657,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"out of the hole leg by leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with"
658,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',a little shout. Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and
659,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"sneezed. 'It is all over,' he said. 'The widow will never come out"
660,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"again.' And the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him,"
661,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',and began to troop down one after another to see if he had spoken the
662,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',truth.
663,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
664,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he
665,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"was--slept and slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had"
666,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',done a hard day's work.
667,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
668,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Now,' he said, when he awoke, 'I will go back to the house. Tell the"
669,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Coppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is"
670,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',dead.'
671,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
672,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',The Coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating
673,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',of a little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he is always
674,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"making it is because he is the town-crier to every Indian garden, and"
675,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',tells all the news to everybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki
676,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"went up the path, he heard his 'attention' notes like a tiny"
677,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',dinner-gong; and then the steady '_Ding-dong-lock!_ Nag is
678,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',dead--_dong!_ Nagaina is dead! _Ding-dong-tock!_' That set all the
679,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"birds in the garden singing, and the frogs croaking; for Nag and"
680,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little birds.
681,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
682,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"When Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddy's mother (she looked"
683,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"very white still, for she had been fainting) and Teddy's father"
684,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',came out and almost cried over him; and that night he ate all
685,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"that was given him till he could I eat no more, and went to bed on"
686,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Teddy's shoulder, where Teddy's mother saw him when she came to look"
687,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',late at night.
688,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
689,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'He saved our lives and Teddy's life,' she said to her husband."
690,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Just think, he saved all our lives.'"
691,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
692,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"Rikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for all the mongooses are light"
693,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',sleepers.
694,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
695,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"'Oh, it's you,' said he. 'What are you bothering for? All the cobras"
696,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"are dead; and if they weren't, I'm here.'"
697,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',
698,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',Rikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself; but he did not grow
699,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"too proud, and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with"
700,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',"tooth and jump and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its"
701,'RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI',head inside the walls.

763,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Martyn picked up the _Pioneer_ from the table, read through the"
764,THE UNDERTAKING.,"telegrams once more, and put up his feet on the chair-rests. It was a"
765,THE UNDERTAKING.,"hot, dark, breathless evening, heavy with the smell of the"
766,THE UNDERTAKING.,newly-watered Mall. The flowers in the Club gardens were dead and
767,THE UNDERTAKING.,"black on their stalks, the little lotus-pond was a circle of caked"
768,THE UNDERTAKING.,"mud, and the tamarisk-trees were white with the dust of days. Most of"
769,THE UNDERTAKING.,the men were at the bandstand in the public gardens--from the Club
770,THE UNDERTAKING.,verandah you could hear the native Police band hammering stale
771,THE UNDERTAKING.,"waltzes--or on the polo-ground or in the high-walled fives-court,"
772,THE UNDERTAKING.,"hotter than a Dutch oven. Half a dozen grooms, squatted at the heads"
773,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of their ponies, waited their masters' return. From time to time a"
774,THE UNDERTAKING.,"man would ride at a foot-pace into the Club compound, and listlessly"
775,THE UNDERTAKING.,loaf over to the whitewashed barracks beside the main building. These
776,THE UNDERTAKING.,"were supposed to be chambers. Men lived in them, meeting the same"
777,THE UNDERTAKING.,"faces night after night at dinner, and drawing out their office-work"
778,THE UNDERTAKING.,"till the latest possible hour, that they might escape that doleful"
779,THE UNDERTAKING.,company.

813,THE UNDERTAKING.,"A dog-cart drove up, and a man entered, mopping his head. He was"

819,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Hi, Raines; you're supposed to know everything,' said Martyn,"

822,THE UNDERTAKING.,'No one knows as yet. There's a message as long as your arm coming in
823,THE UNDERTAKING.,on the telephone. I've left my cub to fill it out. Madras has owned
824,THE UNDERTAKING.,"she can't manage it alone, and Jimmy seems to have a free hand in"

837,THE UNDERTAKING.,
838,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Here to-day and gone to-morrow. Didn't come to stay for ever,' said"

840,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Martyn, your sister's waiting for you.'"
841,THE UNDERTAKING.,
842,THE UNDERTAKING.,A rough gray horse was backing and shifting at the edge of the
843,THE UNDERTAKING.,"verandah, where the light of a kerosene-lamp fell on a brown calico"
844,THE UNDERTAKING.,habit and a white face under a gray felt hat.
845,THE UNDERTAKING.,
846,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Right, O,' said Martyn. 'I'm ready. Better come and dine with us if"
847,THE UNDERTAKING.,"you've nothing to do, Scott. William, is there any dinner in the"
848,THE UNDERTAKING.,house?'
849,THE UNDERTAKING.,
850,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'I'll go home first and see,' was the rider's answer. 'You can drive"
851,THE UNDERTAKING.,"him over--at eight, remember.'"
852,THE UNDERTAKING.,
853,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Scott moved leisurely to his room, and changed into the evening-dress"
854,THE UNDERTAKING.,of the season and the country: spotless white linen from head to
855,THE UNDERTAKING.,"foot, with a broad silk cummerbund. Dinner at the Martyns' was a"
856,THE UNDERTAKING.,"decided improvement on the goat-mutton, twiney-tough fowl, and"
857,THE UNDERTAKING.,tinned entrees of the Club. But it was a great pity Martyn could not
858,THE UNDERTAKING.,afford to send his sister to the Hills for the hot weather. As an
859,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Acting District Superintendent of Police, Martyn drew the magnificent"
860,THE UNDERTAKING.,"pay of six hundred depreciated silver rupees a month, and his little"
861,THE UNDERTAKING.,four-roomed bungalow said just as much. There were the usual
862,THE UNDERTAKING.,blue-and-white striped jail-made rugs on the uneven floor; the usual
863,THE UNDERTAKING.,glass studded Amritsar _phulkaris_ draped to nails driven into the
864,THE UNDERTAKING.,flaking whitewash of the walls; the usual half-dozen chairs that did
865,THE UNDERTAKING.,"not match, picked up at sales of dead men's effects; and the usual"
866,THE UNDERTAKING.,streaks of black grease where the leather punka-thong ran through the
867,THE UNDERTAKING.,wall. It was as though everything had been unpacked the night before
868,THE UNDERTAKING.,to be repacked next morning. Not a door in the house was true on its
869,THE UNDERTAKING.,"hinges. The little windows, fifteen feet up, were darkened with"
870,THE UNDERTAKING.,"wasp-nests, and lizards hunted flies between the beams of the"
871,THE UNDERTAKING.,wood-ceiled roof. But all this was part of Scott's life. Thus did
872,THE UNDERTAKING.,people live who had such an income; and in a land where each man's
873,THE UNDERTAKING.,"pay, age, and position are printed in a book, that all may read, it"
874,THE UNDERTAKING.,is hardly worth while to play at pretences in word or deed. Scott
875,THE UNDERTAKING.,"counted eight years' service in the Irrigation Department, and drew"
876,THE UNDERTAKING.,"eight hundred rupees a month, on the understanding that if he served"
877,THE UNDERTAKING.,the State faithfully for another twenty-two years he could retire on
878,THE UNDERTAKING.,"a pension of some four hundred rupees a month. His working life,"
879,THE UNDERTAKING.,which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in temporary shelters
880,THE UNDERTAKING.,"where a man could sleep, eat, and write letters, was bound up with"
881,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the opening and guarding of irrigation canals, the handling of two or"
882,THE UNDERTAKING.,"three thousand workmen of all castes and creeds, and the payment of"
883,THE UNDERTAKING.,"vast sums of coined silver. He had finished that spring, not without"
884,THE UNDERTAKING.,"credit, the last section of the great Mosuhl Canal, and--much against"
885,THE UNDERTAKING.,"his will, for he hated office work--had been sent in to serve during"
886,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the hot weather on the accounts and supply side of the Department,"
887,THE UNDERTAKING.,with sole charge of the sweltering sub-office at the capital of the
888,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Province. Martyn knew this; William, his sister, knew it; and"
889,THE UNDERTAKING.,everybody knew it.
890,THE UNDERTAKING.,
891,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Scott knew, too, as well as the rest of the world, that Miss Martyn"
892,THE UNDERTAKING.,"had come out to India four years before, to keep house for her"
893,THE UNDERTAKING.,"brother, who, as everyone, again, knew, had borrowed the money to pay"
894,THE UNDERTAKING.,"for her passage, and that she ought, as all the world said, to have"
895,THE UNDERTAKING.,"married long ago. Instead of this, she had refused some half a dozen"
896,THE UNDERTAKING.,"subalterns, a civilian twenty years her senior, one major, and a man"
897,THE UNDERTAKING.,"in the Indian Medical Department. This, too, was common property. She"
898,THE UNDERTAKING.,"had 'stayed down three hot weathers,' as the saying is, because her"
899,THE UNDERTAKING.,brother was in debt and could not afford the expense of her keep at
900,THE UNDERTAKING.,"even a cheap hill-station. Therefore her face was white as bone, and"
901,THE UNDERTAKING.,in the centre of her forehead was a big silvery scar about the size
902,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of a shilling--the mark of a Delhi sore, which is the same as a"
903,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Bagdad date.' This comes from drinking bad water, and slowly eats"
904,THE UNDERTAKING.,into the flesh till it is ripe enough to be burned out with acids.
905,THE UNDERTAKING.,
906,THE UNDERTAKING.,None the less William had enjoyed herself hugely in her four years.
907,THE UNDERTAKING.,Twice she had been nearly drowned while fording a river on horseback;
908,THE UNDERTAKING.,once she had been run away with on a camel; had witnessed a midnight
909,THE UNDERTAKING.,attack of thieves on her brother's camp; had seen justice
910,THE UNDERTAKING.,"administered with long sticks, in the open under trees; could speak"
911,THE UNDERTAKING.,Urdu and even rough Punjabi with a fluency that was envied by her
912,THE UNDERTAKING.,seniors; had altogether fallen out of the habit of writing to her
913,THE UNDERTAKING.,"aunts in England, or cutting the pages of the English magazines; had"
914,THE UNDERTAKING.,"been through a very bad cholera year, seeing sights unfit to be told;"
915,THE UNDERTAKING.,"and had wound up her experiences by six weeks of typhoid fever,"
916,THE UNDERTAKING.,during which her head had been shaved; and hoped to keep her
917,THE UNDERTAKING.,twenty-third birthday that September. It is conceivable that her
918,THE UNDERTAKING.,aunts would not have approved of a girl who never set foot on the
919,THE UNDERTAKING.,ground if a horse were within hail; who rode to dances with a shawl
920,THE UNDERTAKING.,thrown over her skirt; who wore her hair cropped and curling all over
921,THE UNDERTAKING.,her head; who answered indifferently to the name of William or Bill;
922,THE UNDERTAKING.,whose speech was heavy with the flowers of the vernacular; who could
923,THE UNDERTAKING.,"act in amateur theatricals, play on the banjo, rule eight servants"
924,THE UNDERTAKING.,"and two horses, their accounts and their diseases, and look men"
925,THE UNDERTAKING.,"slowly and deliberately between the eyes--yea, after they had"
926,THE UNDERTAKING.,proposed to her and been rejected.
927,THE UNDERTAKING.,
928,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'I like men who do things,' she had confided to a man in the"
929,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Educational Department, who was teaching the sons of cloth merchants"
930,THE UNDERTAKING.,and dyers the beauty of Wordsworth's 'Excursion' in annotated
931,THE UNDERTAKING.,"cram-books; and when he grew poetical, William explained that she"
932,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'didn't understand poetry very much; it made her head ache,' and"
933,THE UNDERTAKING.,another broken heart took refuge at the Club. But it was all
934,THE UNDERTAKING.,"William's fault. She delighted in hearing men talk of their own work,"
935,THE UNDERTAKING.,and that is the most fatal way of bringing a man to your feet.
936,THE UNDERTAKING.,
937,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Scott had known her more or less for some three years, meeting her,"
938,THE UNDERTAKING.,"as a rule, under canvas when his camp and her brother's joined for a"
939,THE UNDERTAKING.,day on the edge of the Indian Desert. He had danced with her several
940,THE UNDERTAKING.,"times at the big Christmas gatherings, when as many as five hundred"
941,THE UNDERTAKING.,white people came into the station; and he had always a great
942,THE UNDERTAKING.,respect for her housekeeping and her dinners.
943,THE UNDERTAKING.,
944,THE UNDERTAKING.,"She looked more like a boy than ever when, after their meal, she sat,"
945,THE UNDERTAKING.,"one foot tucked under her, on the leather camp-sofa, rolling"
946,THE UNDERTAKING.,"cigarettes for her brother, her low forehead puckered beneath the"
947,THE UNDERTAKING.,dark curls as she twiddled the papers. She stuck out her rounded
948,THE UNDERTAKING.,"chin when the tobacco stayed in place, and, with a gesture as true as"
949,THE UNDERTAKING.,"a school-boy's throwing a stone, tossed the finished article across"
950,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the room to Martyn, who caught it with one hand, and continued his"
951,THE UNDERTAKING.,"talk with Scott. It was all 'shop,'--canals and the policing of"
952,THE UNDERTAKING.,canals; the sins of villagers who stole more water than they had paid
953,THE UNDERTAKING.,"for, and the grosser sin of native constables who connived at the"
954,THE UNDERTAKING.,thefts; of the transplanting bodily of villages to newly-irrigated
955,THE UNDERTAKING.,"ground, and of the coming fight with the desert in the south when the"
956,THE UNDERTAKING.,Provincial funds should warrant the opening of the long-surveyed Luni
957,THE UNDERTAKING.,Protective Canal System. And Scott spoke openly of his great desire
958,THE UNDERTAKING.,to be put on one particular section of the work where he knew the
959,THE UNDERTAKING.,"land and the people, and Martyn sighed for a billet in the Himalayan"
960,THE UNDERTAKING.,"foot-hills, and spoke his mind of his superiors, and William rolled"
961,THE UNDERTAKING.,"cigarettes and said nothing, but smiled gravely on her brother"
962,THE UNDERTAKING.,because he was happy.
963,THE UNDERTAKING.,
964,THE UNDERTAKING.,"At ten Scott's horse came to the door, and the evening was ended."
965,THE UNDERTAKING.,
966,THE UNDERTAKING.,The lights of the two low bungalows in which the daily paper was
967,THE UNDERTAKING.,printed showed bright across the road. It was too early to try to
968,THE UNDERTAKING.,"find sleep, and Scott drifted over to the editor. Raines, stripped"
969,THE UNDERTAKING.,"to the waist like a sailor at a gun, lay in a long chair, waiting"
970,THE UNDERTAKING.,for night telegrams. He had a theory that if a man did not stay by
971,THE UNDERTAKING.,his work all day and most of the night he laid himself open to fever;
972,THE UNDERTAKING.,so he ate and slept among his files.
973,THE UNDERTAKING.,
974,THE UNDERTAKING.,'Can you do it?' he said drowsily. 'I didn't mean to bring you over.'
975,THE UNDERTAKING.,
976,THE UNDERTAKING.,'About what? I've been dining at the Martyns'.'
977,THE UNDERTAKING.,
978,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'The famine, of course, Martyn's  warned for it, too. They're taking"
979,THE UNDERTAKING.,men where they can find 'em. I sent a note to you at the Club just
980,THE UNDERTAKING.,"now, asking if you could do us a letter once a week from the"
981,THE UNDERTAKING.,"south--between two and three columns, say. Nothing sensational, of"
982,THE UNDERTAKING.,"course, but just plain facts about who is doing what, and so forth."
983,THE UNDERTAKING.,Our regular rates--ten rupees a column.'
984,THE UNDERTAKING.,
985,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Sorry, but it's out of my line,' Scott answered, staring absently at"
986,THE UNDERTAKING.,the map of India on the wall. 'It's rough on Martyn--very. Wonder
987,THE UNDERTAKING.,what he'll do with his sister. Wonder what the deuce they'll do with
988,THE UNDERTAKING.,me? I've no famine experience. This is the first I've heard of it.
989,THE UNDERTAKING.,_Am_ I ordered?'
990,THE UNDERTAKING.,
991,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Oh, yes. Here's the wire. They'll put you on relief-works,' Raines"
992,THE UNDERTAKING.,"went on, 'with a horde of Madrassis dying like flies; one native"
993,THE UNDERTAKING.,apothecary and half a pint of cholera-mixture among the ten thousand
994,THE UNDERTAKING.,of you. It comes of your being idle for the moment. Every man who
995,THE UNDERTAKING.,isn't doing two men's work seems to have been called upon. Hawkins
996,THE UNDERTAKING.,evidently believes in Punjabis. It's going to be quite as bad as
997,THE UNDERTAKING.,anything they have had in the last ten years.'
998,THE UNDERTAKING.,
999,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'It's all in the day's work, worse luck. I suppose I shall get my"
1000,THE UNDERTAKING.,orders officially some time to morrow. I'm glad I happened to drop
1001,THE UNDERTAKING.,in. Better go and pack my kit now. Who relieves me here--do you
1002,THE UNDERTAKING.,know?'
1003,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1004,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Raines turned over a sheaf of telegrams. 'McEuan,' said he, 'from"
1005,THE UNDERTAKING.,Murree.'
1006,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1007,THE UNDERTAKING.,Scott chuckled. 'He thought he was going to be cool all summer. He'll
1008,THE UNDERTAKING.,"be very sick about this. Well, no good talking. Night.'"
1009,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1010,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Two hours later, Scott, with a clear conscience, laid himself down to"
1011,THE UNDERTAKING.,"rest on a string cot in a bare room. Two worn bullock-trunks, a"
1012,THE UNDERTAKING.,"leather water-bottle, a tin ice-box, and his pet saddle sewed up in"
1013,THE UNDERTAKING.,"sacking were piled at the door, and the Club secretary's receipt for"
1014,THE UNDERTAKING.,"last month's bill was under his pillow. His orders came next morning,"
1015,THE UNDERTAKING.,"and with them an unofficial telegram from Sir James Hawkins, who did"
1016,THE UNDERTAKING.,"not forget good men, bidding him report himself with all speed at"
1017,THE UNDERTAKING.,"some unpronounceable place fifteen hundred miles to the south, for"
1018,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the famine was sore in the land, and white men were needed."
1019,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1020,THE UNDERTAKING.,"A pink and fattish youth arrived in the red-hot noonday, whimpering a"
1021,THE UNDERTAKING.,"little at fate and famines, which never allowed any one three months'"
1022,THE UNDERTAKING.,"peace. He was Scott's successor--another cog in the machinery, moved"
1023,THE UNDERTAKING.,"forward behind his fellow, whose services, as the official"
1024,THE UNDERTAKING.,"announcement ran, 'were placed at the disposal of the Madras"
1025,THE UNDERTAKING.,Government for famine duty until further orders.' Scott handed over
1026,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the funds in his charge, showed him the coolest corner in the office,"
1027,THE UNDERTAKING.,"warned him against excess of zeal, and, as twilight fell, departed"
1028,THE UNDERTAKING.,"from the Club in a hired carriage, with his faithful body servant,"
1029,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Faiz Ullah, and a mound of disordered baggage atop, to catch the"
1030,THE UNDERTAKING.,Southern Mail at the loopholed and bastioned railway-station. The
1031,THE UNDERTAKING.,heat from the thick brick walls struck him across the face as if it
1032,THE UNDERTAKING.,"had been a hot towel, and he reflected that there were at least five"
1033,THE UNDERTAKING.,"nights and four days of travel before him. Faiz Ullah, used to the"
1034,THE UNDERTAKING.,"chances of service, plunged into the crowd on the stone platform,"
1035,THE UNDERTAKING.,"while Scott, a black cheroot between his teeth, waited till his"
1036,THE UNDERTAKING.,"compartment should be set away. A dozen native policemen, with their"
1037,THE UNDERTAKING.,"rifles and bundles, shouldered into the press of Punjabi farmers,"
1038,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Sikh craftsmen, and greasy-locked Afreedee pedlars, escorting with"
1039,THE UNDERTAKING.,"all pomp Martyn's uniform case, water-bottles, ice-box, and"
1040,THE UNDERTAKING.,"bedding-roll. They saw Faiz Ullah's lifted hand, and steered for it."
1041,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1042,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'My Sahib and your Sahib,' said Faiz Ullah to Martyn's man, 'will"
1043,THE UNDERTAKING.,"travel together. Thou and I, O brother, will thus secure the"
1044,THE UNDERTAKING.,"servants' places close by, and because of our masters' authority none"
1045,THE UNDERTAKING.,will dare to disturb us.'
1046,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1047,THE UNDERTAKING.,"When Faiz Ullah reported all things ready, Scott settled down"
1048,THE UNDERTAKING.,coatless and bootless on the broad leather-covered bunk. The heat
1049,THE UNDERTAKING.,under the iron-arched roof of the station might have been anything
1050,THE UNDERTAKING.,"over a hundred degrees. At the last moment Martyn entered, hot and"
1051,THE UNDERTAKING.,dripping.
1052,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1053,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Don't swear,' said Scott, lazily; 'it's too late to change your"
1054,THE UNDERTAKING.,carriage; and we'll divide the ice.'
1055,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1056,THE UNDERTAKING.,'What are you doing here?' said the policeman.
1057,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1058,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Lent to the Madras Government, same as you. By Jove, it's a bender"
1059,THE UNDERTAKING.,of a night! Are you taking any of your men down?'
1060,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1061,THE UNDERTAKING.,'A dozen. Suppose I'll have to superintend relief distributions.
1062,THE UNDERTAKING.,Didn't know you were under orders too.'
1063,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1064,THE UNDERTAKING.,'I didn't till after I left you last night. Raines had the news
1065,THE UNDERTAKING.,"first. My orders came this morning. McEuan relieved me at four, and"
1066,THE UNDERTAKING.,I got off at once. Shouldn't wonder if it wouldn't be a good
1067,THE UNDERTAKING.,thing--this famine--if we come through it alive.'
1068,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1069,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Jimmy ought to put you and me to work together,' said Martyn; and"
1070,THE UNDERTAKING.,"then, after a pause: 'My sister's here.'"
1071,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1072,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Good business,' said Scott, heartily. 'Going to get off at Umballa,"
1073,THE UNDERTAKING.,"I suppose, and go up to Simla. Who'll she stay with there?'"
1074,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1075,THE UNDERTAKING.,'No-o; that's just the trouble of it. She's going down with me.'
1076,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1077,THE UNDERTAKING.,Scott sat bolt upright under the oil lamp as the train jolted past
1078,THE UNDERTAKING.,Tarn-Taran station. 'What! You don't mean you couldn't afford--'
1079,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1080,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Oh, I'd have scraped up the money somehow.'"
1081,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1082,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'You might have come to me, to begin with,' said Scott, stiffly; 'we"
1083,THE UNDERTAKING.,aren't altogether strangers.'
1084,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1085,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Well, you needn't be stuffy about it. I might, but--you don't know"
1086,THE UNDERTAKING.,my sister. I've been explaining and exhorting and entreating and
1087,THE UNDERTAKING.,commanding and all the rest of it all day--lost my temper since seven
1088,THE UNDERTAKING.,"this morning, and haven't got it back yet--but she wouldn't hear of"
1089,THE UNDERTAKING.,"any compromise, A woman's entitled to travel with her husband if she"
1090,THE UNDERTAKING.,"wants to, and William says she's on the same footing. You see, we've"
1091,THE UNDERTAKING.,"been together all our lives, more or less, since my people died. It"
1092,THE UNDERTAKING.,isn't as if she were an ordinary sister.'
1093,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1094,THE UNDERTAKING.,'All the sisters I've ever heard of would have stayed where they were
1095,THE UNDERTAKING.,well off.'
1096,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1097,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'She's as clever as a man, confound her,' Martyn went on. 'She broke"
1098,THE UNDERTAKING.,up the bungalow over my head while I was talking at her. Settled the
1099,THE UNDERTAKING.,"whole _subchiz_ [outfit] in three hours--servants, horses, and all. I"
1100,THE UNDERTAKING.,didn't get my orders till nine.
1101,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1102,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Jimmy Hawkins won't be pleased,' said Scott. 'A famine's no place"
1103,THE UNDERTAKING.,for a woman.'
1104,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1105,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Mrs. Jim--I mean Lady Jim's in camp with him. At any rate, she says"
1106,THE UNDERTAKING.,she will look after my sister. William wired down to her on her own
1107,THE UNDERTAKING.,"responsibility, asking if she could come, and knocked the ground from"
1108,THE UNDERTAKING.,under me by showing me her answer.'
1109,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1110,THE UNDERTAKING.,Scott laughed aloud. 'If she can do that she can take care of
1111,THE UNDERTAKING.,"herself, and Mrs. Jim won't let her run into any mischief. There"
1112,THE UNDERTAKING.,"aren't many women, sisters or wives, who would walk into a famine"
1113,THE UNDERTAKING.,with their eyes open. It isn't as if she didn't know what these
1114,THE UNDERTAKING.,things mean. She was through the Jaloo cholera last year.'
1115,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1116,THE UNDERTAKING.,"The train stopped at Amritsar, and Scott went back to the ladies'"
1117,THE UNDERTAKING.,"compartment, immediately behind their carriage. William, a cloth"
1118,THE UNDERTAKING.,"riding-cap on her curls, nodded affably."
1119,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1120,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Come in and have some tea,' she said. 'Best thing in the world for"
1121,THE UNDERTAKING.,heat-apoplexy.'
1122,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1123,THE UNDERTAKING.,'Do I look as if I were going to have heat-apoplexy?'
1124,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1125,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Never can tell,' said William, wisely. 'It's always best to be"
1126,THE UNDERTAKING.,ready.'
1127,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1128,THE UNDERTAKING.,She had arranged her belongings with the knowledge of an old
1129,THE UNDERTAKING.,campaigner. A felt-covered water-bottle hung in the draught of one
1130,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of the shuttered windows; a tea-set of Russian china, packed in a"
1131,THE UNDERTAKING.,"wadded basket, stood ready on the seat: and a travelling spirit-lamp"
1132,THE UNDERTAKING.,was clamped against the woodwork above it.
1133,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1134,THE UNDERTAKING.,"William served them generously, in large cups, hot tea, which saves"
1135,THE UNDERTAKING.,the veins of the neck from swelling inopportunely on a hot night. It
1136,THE UNDERTAKING.,"was characteristic of the girl that, her plan of action once settled,"
1137,THE UNDERTAKING.,she asked for no comments on it. Life with men who had a great deal
1138,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of work to do, and very little time to do it in, had taught her the"
1139,THE UNDERTAKING.,wisdom of effacing as well as of fending for herself. She did not by
1140,THE UNDERTAKING.,"word or deed suggest that she would be useful, comforting, or"
1141,THE UNDERTAKING.,"beautiful in their travels, but continued about her business"
1142,THE UNDERTAKING.,"serenely: put the cups back without clatter when tea was ended, and"
1143,THE UNDERTAKING.,made cigarettes for her guests.
1144,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1145,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'This time last night,' said Scott, 'we didn't expect--er--this kind"
1146,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of thing, did we?'"
1147,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1148,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'I've learned to expect anything,' said William. 'You know, in our"
1149,THE UNDERTAKING.,"service, we live at the end of the telegraph; but, of course, this"
1150,THE UNDERTAKING.,"ought to be a good thing for us all, departmentally--if we live.'"
1151,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1152,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'It knocks us out of the running in our own Province,' Scott replied,"
1153,THE UNDERTAKING.,with equal gravity. 'I hoped to be put on the Luni Protective Works
1154,THE UNDERTAKING.,this cold weather; but there's no saying how long the famine may keep
1155,THE UNDERTAKING.,us.'
1156,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1157,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Hardly beyond October I should think,' said Martyn. 'It will be"
1158,THE UNDERTAKING.,"ended, one way or the other, then.'"
1159,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1160,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'And we've nearly a week of this,' said William. 'Sha'n't we be dusty"
1161,THE UNDERTAKING.,when it's over?'
1162,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1163,THE UNDERTAKING.,For a night and a day they knew their surroundings; and for a night
1164,THE UNDERTAKING.,"and a day, skirting the edge of the great Indian Desert on a"
1165,THE UNDERTAKING.,"narrow-gauge line, they remembered how in the days of their"
1166,THE UNDERTAKING.,apprenticeship they had come by that road from Bombay. Then the
1167,THE UNDERTAKING.,"languages in which the names of the stations were written changed,"
1168,THE UNDERTAKING.,"and they launched south into a foreign land, where the very"
1169,THE UNDERTAKING.,smells were new. Many long and heavily-laden grain trains were in
1170,THE UNDERTAKING.,"front of them, and they could feel the hand of Jimmy Hawkins from"
1171,THE UNDERTAKING.,far off. They waited in extemporised sidings blocked by processions
1172,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of empty trucks returning to the north, and were coupled on to"
1173,THE UNDERTAKING.,"slow, crawling trains, and dropped at midnight, Heaven knew where;"
1174,THE UNDERTAKING.,"but it was furiously hot; and they walked to and fro among sacks,"
1175,THE UNDERTAKING.,and dogs howled.
1176,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1177,THE UNDERTAKING.,Then they came to an India more strange to them than to the
1178,THE UNDERTAKING.,"untravelled Englishman--the flat, red India of palm-tree,"
1179,THE UNDERTAKING.,"palmyra-palm, and rice, the India of the picture-books, of _Little"
1180,THE UNDERTAKING.,Henry and His Bearer_--all dead and dry in the baking heat. They had
1181,THE UNDERTAKING.,left the incessant passenger-traffic of the north and west far and
1182,THE UNDERTAKING.,"far behind them. Here the people crawled to the side of the train,"
1183,THE UNDERTAKING.,holding their little ones  in  their  arms; and a loaded truck would
1184,THE UNDERTAKING.,"be left behind, men and women clustering round and above it like ants"
1185,THE UNDERTAKING.,by spilled honey. Once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a
1186,THE UNDERTAKING.,"regiment of little brown men, each bearing a body over his shoulder;"
1187,THE UNDERTAKING.,"and when the train stopped to leave yet another truck, they perceived"
1188,THE UNDERTAKING.,"that the burdens were not corpses, but only foodless folk picked up"
1189,THE UNDERTAKING.,beside their dead oxen by a corps of Irregular troops. Now they met
1190,THE UNDERTAKING.,"more white men, here one and there two, whose tents stood close to"
1191,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the line, and who came armed with written authorities and angry words"
1192,THE UNDERTAKING.,to cut off a truck. They were too busy to do more than nod at Scott
1193,THE UNDERTAKING.,"and Martyn, and stare curiously at William, who could do nothing"
1194,THE UNDERTAKING.,"except make tea, and watch how her men staved off the rush of"
1195,THE UNDERTAKING.,"wailing, walking skeletons, putting them down three at a time in"
1196,THE UNDERTAKING.,"heaps, with their own hands uncoupling the marked trucks, or taking"
1197,THE UNDERTAKING.,"receipts from the hollowed-eyed, weary white men, who spoke another"
1198,THE UNDERTAKING.,argot than theirs.
1199,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1200,THE UNDERTAKING.,"They ran out of ice, out of soda-water, and out of tea; for they were"
1201,THE UNDERTAKING.,"six days and seven nights on the road, and it seemed to them like"
1202,THE UNDERTAKING.,seven times seven years.
1203,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1204,THE UNDERTAKING.,"At last, in a dry, hot dawn, in a land of death, lit by long red"
1205,THE UNDERTAKING.,"fires of railway sleepers, where they were burning the dead, they"
1206,THE UNDERTAKING.,"came to their destination, and were met by Jim Hawkins, the Head of"
1207,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the Famine, unshaven, unwashed, but cheery, and entirely in command"
1208,THE UNDERTAKING.,of affairs.
1209,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1210,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Martyn, he decreed, then and there, was to live on trains till"
1211,THE UNDERTAKING.,"further orders; was to go back with empty trucks, filling them with"
1212,THE UNDERTAKING.,"starving people as he found them, and dropping them at a famine-camp"
1213,THE UNDERTAKING.,on the edge of the Eight Districts. He would pick up supplies and
1214,THE UNDERTAKING.,"return, and his constables would guard the loaded grain-cars, also"
1215,THE UNDERTAKING.,"picking up people, and would drop them at a camp a hundred miles"
1216,THE UNDERTAKING.,"south. Scott--Hawkins was very glad to see Scott again--would, that"
1217,THE UNDERTAKING.,"same hour, take charge of a convoy of bullock-carts, and would go"
1218,THE UNDERTAKING.,"south, feeding as he went, to yet another famine-camp, far from the"
1219,THE UNDERTAKING.,"rail, where he would leave his starving--there would be no lack of"
1220,THE UNDERTAKING.,"starving on the route--and wait for orders by telegraph. Generally,"
1221,THE UNDERTAKING.,Scott was in all small things to do what he thought best.
1222,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1223,THE UNDERTAKING.,William bit her under lip. There was no one in the wide world like
1224,THE UNDERTAKING.,"her one brother, but Martyn's orders gave him no discretion. She came"
1225,THE UNDERTAKING.,"out, masked with dust from head to foot, a horse-shoe wrinkle on her"
1226,THE UNDERTAKING.,"forehead, put here by much thinking during the past week, but as"
1227,THE UNDERTAKING.,"self-possessed as ever. Mrs. Jim--who should have been Lady Jim, but"
1228,THE UNDERTAKING.,that no one remembered to call her aright--took possession of her
1229,THE UNDERTAKING.,with a little gasp.
1230,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1231,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Oh, I'm so glad you're here,' she almost sobbed. 'You oughtn't to,"
1232,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of course, but there--there isn't another woman in the place, and we"
1233,THE UNDERTAKING.,"must help each other, you know; and we've all the wretched people and"
1234,THE UNDERTAKING.,the little babies they are selling.'
1235,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1236,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'I've seen some,' said William."
1237,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1238,THE UNDERTAKING.,'Isn't it ghastly? I've bought twenty; they're in our camp; but won't
1239,THE UNDERTAKING.,you have something to eat first? We've more than ten people can do
1240,THE UNDERTAKING.,"here; and I've got a horse for you. Oh, I'm so glad you've come!"
1241,THE UNDERTAKING.,"You're a Punjabi too, you know.'"
1242,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1243,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Steady, Lizzie,' said Hawkins, over his shoulder. 'We'll look after"
1244,THE UNDERTAKING.,"you, Miss Martyn. Sorry I can't ask you to breakfast, Martyn. You'll"
1245,THE UNDERTAKING.,have to eat as you go. Leave two of your men to help Scott. These
1246,THE UNDERTAKING.,poor devils can't stand up to load carts. Saunders' (this to the
1247,THE UNDERTAKING.,"engine-driver, half asleep in the cab), 'back down and get those"
1248,THE UNDERTAKING.,empties away.' You've 'line clear' to Anundrapillay; they'll give you
1249,THE UNDERTAKING.,"orders north of that. Scott, load up your carts from that B.P.P."
1250,THE UNDERTAKING.,"truck, and be off as soon as you can. The Eurasian in the pink shirt"
1251,THE UNDERTAKING.,is your interpreter and guide. You'll find an apothecary of sorts
1252,THE UNDERTAKING.,tied to the yoke of the second wagon. He's been trying to bolt;
1253,THE UNDERTAKING.,"you'll have to look after him. Lizzie, drive Miss Martyn to camp, and"
1254,THE UNDERTAKING.,tell them to send the red horse down here for me.'
1255,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1256,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Scott, with Faiz Ullah and two policemen, was already busy on the"
1257,THE UNDERTAKING.,"carts, backing them up to the truck and unbolting the sideboards"
1258,THE UNDERTAKING.,"quietly, while the others pitched in the bags of millet and wheat."
1259,THE UNDERTAKING.,Hawkins watched him for as long as it took to fill one cart.
1260,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1261,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'That's a good man,' he said. 'If all goes well I shall work"
1262,THE UNDERTAKING.,him--hard.' This was Jim Hawkins's notion of the highest compliment
1263,THE UNDERTAKING.,one human being could pay another.
1264,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1265,THE UNDERTAKING.,An hour later Scott was under way; the apothecary threatening him
1266,THE UNDERTAKING.,"with the penalties of the law for that he, a member of the"
1267,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Subordinate Medical Department, had been coerced and bound against"
1268,THE UNDERTAKING.,his will and all laws governing the liberty of the subject; the
1269,THE UNDERTAKING.,"pink-shirted Eurasian begging leave to see his mother, who happened"
1270,THE UNDERTAKING.,"to be dying some three miles, away: 'Only verree, verree short leave"
1271,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of absence, and will presently return, sar--'; the two constables,"
1272,THE UNDERTAKING.,"armed with staves, bringing up the rear; and Faiz Ullah, a"
1273,THE UNDERTAKING.,Mohammedan's contempt for all Hindoos and foreigners in every line of
1274,THE UNDERTAKING.,"his face, explaining to the drivers that though Scott Sahib was a man"
1275,THE UNDERTAKING.,"to be feared on all fours, he, Faiz Ullah, was Authority itself."
1276,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1277,THE UNDERTAKING.,The procession creaked past Hawkins's camp--three stained tents under
1278,THE UNDERTAKING.,a clump of dead trees; behind them the famine-shed where a crowd of
1279,THE UNDERTAKING.,hopeless ones tossed their arms around the cooking-kettles.
1280,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1281,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Wish to Heaven William had kept out of it,' said Scott to himself,"
1282,THE UNDERTAKING.,"after a glance. 'We'll have cholera, sure as a gun, when the Rains"
1283,THE UNDERTAKING.,come.'
1284,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1285,THE UNDERTAKING.,But William seemed to have taken kindly to the operations of the
1286,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Famine Code, which, when famine is declared, supersede the workings"
1287,THE UNDERTAKING.,"of the ordinary law. Scott saw her, the centre of a mob of weeping"
1288,THE UNDERTAKING.,"women, in a calico riding-habit and a blue-gray felt hat with a gold"
1289,THE UNDERTAKING.,puggaree.
1290,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1291,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'I want fifty rupees, please. I forgot to ask Jack before he went"
1292,THE UNDERTAKING.,"away. Can you lend it me? It's for condensed milk for the babies,'"
1293,THE UNDERTAKING.,said she.
1294,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1295,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Scott took the money from his belt, and handed it over without a"
1296,THE UNDERTAKING.,"word. 'For goodness sake take care of yourself,' he said."
1297,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1298,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Oh, I shall be all right. We ought to get the milk in two days. By"
1299,THE UNDERTAKING.,"the way, the orders are, I was to tell you, that you're to take one"
1300,THE UNDERTAKING.,of Sir Jim's horses. There's a gray Cabuli here that I thought would
1301,THE UNDERTAKING.,"be just your style, so I've said you'd take him. Was that right?'"
1302,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1303,THE UNDERTAKING.,'That's awfully good of you. We can't either of us talk much about
1304,THE UNDERTAKING.,"style, I'm afraid.'"
1305,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1306,THE UNDERTAKING.,"Scott was in a weather-stained drill shooting-kit, very white at the"
1307,THE UNDERTAKING.,seams and a little frayed at the wrists. William regarded him
1308,THE UNDERTAKING.,"thoughtfully, from his pith helmet to his greased ankle-boots. 'You"
1309,THE UNDERTAKING.,"look very nice, I think. Are you sure you've everything you'll"
1310,THE UNDERTAKING.,"need--quinine, chlorodyne, and so on?'"
1311,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1312,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Think so,' said Scott, patting three or four of his shooting pockets"
1313,THE UNDERTAKING.,"as the horse was led up, and he mounted and rode alongside his"
1314,THE UNDERTAKING.,convoy.
1315,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1316,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Good-bye,' he cried."
1317,THE UNDERTAKING.,
1318,THE UNDERTAKING.,"'Good-bye, and good luck,' said William. 'I'm awfully obliged for the"
1319,THE UNDERTAKING.,"money.' She turned on a spurred heel and disappeared into the tent,"
1320,THE UNDERTAKING.,"while the carts pushed on past the famine-sheds, past the roaring"
1321,THE UNDERTAKING.,"lines of the thick, fat fires, down to the baked Gehenna of the"
1322,THE UNDERTAKING.,South.

1335,A VALEDICTION.,A VALEDICTION.
1336,A VALEDICTION.,
1337,A VALEDICTION.,"It was punishing work, even though he travelled by night and camped"
1338,A VALEDICTION.,by day; but within the limits of his vision there was no man whom
1339,A VALEDICTION.,"Scott could call master. He was as free as Jimmy Hawkins--freer, in"
1340,A VALEDICTION.,"fact, for the Government held the Head of the Famine tied neatly to a"
1341,A VALEDICTION.,"telegraph-wire, and if Jimmy had ever regarded telegrams seriously,"
1342,A VALEDICTION.,the death-rate of that famine would have been much higher than it
1343,A VALEDICTION.,was.
1344,A VALEDICTION.,
1345,A VALEDICTION.,At the end of a few days' crawling Scott learned something of the
1346,A VALEDICTION.,"size of the India which he served; and it astonished him. His carts,"
1347,A VALEDICTION.,"as you know, were loaded with wheat, millet, and barley, good"
1348,A VALEDICTION.,food-grains needing only a little grinding. But the people to whom he
1349,A VALEDICTION.,brought the life-giving stuffs were rice eaters. They knew how to
1350,A VALEDICTION.,"hull rice in their mortars, but they knew nothing of the heavy stone"
1351,A VALEDICTION.,"querns of the North, and less of the material that the white man"
1352,A VALEDICTION.,"convoyed so laboriously. They clamoured for rice--unhusked paddy,"
1353,A VALEDICTION.,"such as they were accustomed to--and, when they found that there was"
1354,A VALEDICTION.,"none, broke away weeping from the sides of the cart. What was the use"
1355,A VALEDICTION.,of these strange hard grains that choked their throats? They would
1356,A VALEDICTION.,die. And then and there were many of them kept their word. Others
1357,A VALEDICTION.,"took their allowance, and bartered enough millet to feed a man"
1358,A VALEDICTION.,through a week for a few handfuls of rotten rice saved by some less
1359,A VALEDICTION.,"unfortunate. A few put their shares into the rice-mortars, pounded"
1360,A VALEDICTION.,"it, and made a paste with foul water; but they were very few. Scott"
1361,A VALEDICTION.,"understood dimly that many people in the India of the South ate rice,"
1362,A VALEDICTION.,"as a rule, but he had spent his service in a grain Province, had"
1363,A VALEDICTION.,"seldom seen rice in the blade or the ear, and least of all would"
1364,A VALEDICTION.,"have believed that, in time of deadly need, men would die at arm's"
1365,A VALEDICTION.,"length of plenty, sooner than touch food they did not know. In vain"
1366,A VALEDICTION.,the interpreters interpreted; in vain his two policemen showed by
1367,A VALEDICTION.,vigorous pantomime what should be done. The starving crept away to
1368,A VALEDICTION.,"their bark and weeds, grubs, leaves, and clay, and left the open"
1369,A VALEDICTION.,sacks untouched. But sometimes the women laid their phantoms of
1370,A VALEDICTION.,"children at Scott's feet, looking back as they staggered away."
1371,A VALEDICTION.,
1372,A VALEDICTION.,Faiz Ullah opined it was the will of God that these foreigners should
1373,A VALEDICTION.,"die, and therefore it remained only to give orders to burn the dead."
1374,A VALEDICTION.,None the less there was no reason why the Sahib should lack his
1375,A VALEDICTION.,"comforts, and Faiz Ullah, a campaigner of experience, had picked up a"
1376,A VALEDICTION.,few lean goats and had added them to the procession. That they might
1377,A VALEDICTION.,"give milk for the morning meal, he was feeding them on the good grain"
1378,A VALEDICTION.,"that these imbeciles rejected. 'Yes,' said Faiz Ullah; 'if the Sahib"
1379,A VALEDICTION.,"thought fit, a little milk might be given to some of the babies';"
1380,A VALEDICTION.,"but, as the Sahib well knew, babies were cheap, and, for his own"
1381,A VALEDICTION.,"part, Faiz Ullah held that there was no Government order as to"
1382,A VALEDICTION.,"babies. Scott spoke forcefully to Faiz Ullah and the two policemen,"
1383,A VALEDICTION.,and bade them capture goats where they could find them. This they
1384,A VALEDICTION.,"most joyfully did, for it was a recreation, and many ownerless goats"
1385,A VALEDICTION.,"were driven in. Once fed, the poor brutes were willing enough to"
1386,A VALEDICTION.,"follow the carts, and a few days' good food--food such as human"
1387,A VALEDICTION.,beings died for lack of--set them in milk again.
1388,A VALEDICTION.,
1389,A VALEDICTION.,"'But I am no goatherd,' said Faiz Ullah. 'It is against my _izzat_"
1390,A VALEDICTION.,[my honour].'
1391,A VALEDICTION.,
1392,A VALEDICTION.,"'When we cross the Bias River again we will talk of _izzat_,' Scott"
1393,A VALEDICTION.,replied. 'Till that day thou and the policemen shall be sweepers to
1394,A VALEDICTION.,"the camp, if I give the order.'"
1395,A VALEDICTION.,
1396,A VALEDICTION.,"'Thus, then, it is done,' grunted Faiz Ullah, 'if the Sahib will have"
1397,A VALEDICTION.,"it so'; and he showed how a goat should be milked, while Scott stood"
1398,A VALEDICTION.,over him.
1399,A VALEDICTION.,
1400,A VALEDICTION.,"'Now we will feed them,' said Scott; 'thrice a day we will feed"
1401,A VALEDICTION.,"them'; and he bowed his back to the milking, and took a horrible"
1402,A VALEDICTION.,cramp.
1403,A VALEDICTION.,
1404,A VALEDICTION.,When you have to keep connection unbroken between a restless mother
1405,A VALEDICTION.,"of kids and a baby who is at the point of death, you suffer in all"
1406,A VALEDICTION.,"your system. But the babies were fed. Morning, noon and evening Scott"
1407,A VALEDICTION.,would solemnly lift them out one by one from their nest of gunny-bags
1408,A VALEDICTION.,under the cart-tilts. There were always many who could do no more
1409,A VALEDICTION.,"than breathe, and the milk was dropped into their toothless mouths"
1410,A VALEDICTION.,"drop by drop, with due pauses when they choked. Each morning, too,"
1411,A VALEDICTION.,"the goats were fed; and since they would struggle without a leader,"
1412,A VALEDICTION.,"and since the natives were hirelings, Scott was forced to give up"
1413,A VALEDICTION.,"riding, and pace slowly at the head of his flocks, accommodating"
1414,A VALEDICTION.,"his step to their weaknesses. All this was sufficiently absurd, and"
1415,A VALEDICTION.,"he felt the absurdity keenly; but at least he was saving life, and"
1416,A VALEDICTION.,"when the women saw that their children did not die, they made shift"
1417,A VALEDICTION.,"to eat a little of the strange foods, and crawled after the carts,"
1418,A VALEDICTION.,blessing the master of the goats.
1419,A VALEDICTION.,
1420,A VALEDICTION.,"'Give the women something to live for,' said Scott to himself, as"
1421,A VALEDICTION.,"he sneezed in the dust of a hundred little feet, 'and they'll hang"
1422,A VALEDICTION.,on somehow. But this beats William's condensed milk trick all to
1423,A VALEDICTION.,"pieces. I shall never live it down, though.'"
1424,A VALEDICTION.,
1425,A VALEDICTION.,"He reached his destination very slowly, found that a rice-ship had"
1426,A VALEDICTION.,"come in from Burmah, and that stores of paddy were available; found"
1427,A VALEDICTION.,"also an overworked Englishman in charge of the shed, and, loading the"
1428,A VALEDICTION.,"carts, set back to cover the ground he had already passed. He left"
1429,A VALEDICTION.,some of the children and half his goats at the famine-shed. For this
1430,A VALEDICTION.,"he was not thanked by the Englishman, who had already more stray"
1431,A VALEDICTION.,babies than he knew what to do with. Scott's back was suppled to
1432,A VALEDICTION.,"stooping now, and he went on with his wayside ministrations in"
1433,A VALEDICTION.,addition to distributing the paddy. More babies and more goats were
1434,A VALEDICTION.,"added unto him; but now some of the babies wore rags, and beads round"
1435,A VALEDICTION.,"their wrists or necks. '_That_,' said the interpreter, as though"
1436,A VALEDICTION.,"Scott did not know, 'signifies that their mothers hope in eventual"
1437,A VALEDICTION.,contingency to resume them offeecially.'
1438,A VALEDICTION.,
1439,A VALEDICTION.,"'The sooner the better,' said Scott; but at the same time he marked,"
1440,A VALEDICTION.,"with the pride of ownership, how this or that little Ramasawmy was"
1441,A VALEDICTION.,putting on flesh like a bantam. As the paddy carts were emptied he
1442,A VALEDICTION.,"headed for Hawkins's camp by the railway, timing his arrival to fit"
1443,A VALEDICTION.,"in with the dinner-hour, for it was long since he had eaten at a"
1444,A VALEDICTION.,"cloth. He had no desire to make any dramatic entry, but an accident"
1445,A VALEDICTION.,"of the sunset ordered it that, when he had taken off his helmet to"
1446,A VALEDICTION.,"get the evening breeze, the low light should fall across his"
1447,A VALEDICTION.,"forehead, and he could not see what was before him; while one"
1448,A VALEDICTION.,"waiting at the tent door beheld, with new eyes, a young man,"
1449,A VALEDICTION.,"beautiful as Paris, a god in a halo of golden dust, walking slowly"
1450,A VALEDICTION.,"at the head of his flocks, while at his knee ran small naked Cupids."
1451,A VALEDICTION.,"But she laughed--William, in a slate-coloured blouse, laughed"
1452,A VALEDICTION.,"consumedly till Scott, putting the best face he could upon the"
1453,A VALEDICTION.,"matter, halted his armies and bade her admire the kindergarten. It"
1454,A VALEDICTION.,"was an unseemly sight, but the proprieties had been left ages ago,"
1455,A VALEDICTION.,"with the tea-party at Amritsar Station, fifteen hundred miles to the"
1456,A VALEDICTION.,northward.
1457,A VALEDICTION.,
1458,A VALEDICTION.,"'They are coming on nicely,' said William. 'We've only"
1459,A VALEDICTION.,five-and-twenty here now. The women are beginning to take them away
1460,A VALEDICTION.,again.'
1461,A VALEDICTION.,
1462,A VALEDICTION.,"'Are you in charge of the babies, then?'"
1463,A VALEDICTION.,
1464,A VALEDICTION.,"'Yes--Mrs. Jim and I. We didn't think of goats, though. We've been"
1465,A VALEDICTION.,trying condensed milk and water.'
1466,A VALEDICTION.,
1467,A VALEDICTION.,'Any losses?'
1468,A VALEDICTION.,
1469,A VALEDICTION.,"'More than I care to think of,' said William, with a shudder. 'And"
1470,A VALEDICTION.,you?'
1471,A VALEDICTION.,
1472,A VALEDICTION.,Scott said nothing. There had been many little burials along his
1473,A VALEDICTION.,route--many mothers who had wept when they did not find again the
1474,A VALEDICTION.,children they had trusted to the care of the Government.
1475,A VALEDICTION.,
1476,A VALEDICTION.,"Then Hawkins came out carrying a razor, at which Scott looked"
1477,A VALEDICTION.,"hungrily, for he had a beard that he did not love. And when they"
1478,A VALEDICTION.,"sat down to dinner in the tent he told his tale in few words, as it"
1479,A VALEDICTION.,might have been an official report. Mrs. Jim snuffled from time to
1480,A VALEDICTION.,"time, and Jim bowed his head judicially; but William's gray eyes were"
1481,A VALEDICTION.,"on the clean-shaven face, and it was to her that Scott seemed to"
1482,A VALEDICTION.,speak.
1483,A VALEDICTION.,
1484,A VALEDICTION.,"'Good for the Pauper Province!' said William, her chin in her hand,"
1485,A VALEDICTION.,as she leaned forward among the wine-glasses. Her cheeks had fallen
1486,A VALEDICTION.,"in, and the scar on her forehead was more prominent than ever, but"
1487,A VALEDICTION.,the well-turned neck rose roundly as a column from the ruffle of the
1488,A VALEDICTION.,blouse which was the accepted evening-dress in camp.
1489,A VALEDICTION.,
1490,A VALEDICTION.,"'It was awfully absurd at times,' said Scott. 'You see I didn't know"
1491,A VALEDICTION.,"much about milking or babies. They'll chaff my head off, if the tale"
1492,A VALEDICTION.,goes north.'
1493,A VALEDICTION.,
1494,A VALEDICTION.,"'Let 'em,' said William, haughtily. 'We've all done coolie-work"
1495,A VALEDICTION.,"since we came. I know Jack has.' This was to Hawkins's address, and"
1496,A VALEDICTION.,the big man smiled blandly.
1497,A VALEDICTION.,
1498,A VALEDICTION.,"'Your brother's a highly efficient officer, William,' said he, and"
1499,A VALEDICTION.,"I've done him the honour of treating him as he deserves. Remember, I"
1500,A VALEDICTION.,write the confidential reports.'
1501,A VALEDICTION.,
1502,A VALEDICTION.,"'Then you must say that William's worth her weight in gold,' said"
1503,A VALEDICTION.,Mrs. Jim. 'I don't know what we should have done without her. She has
1504,A VALEDICTION.,"been everything to us.' She dropped her hand upon William's, which"
1505,A VALEDICTION.,"was rough with much handling of reins, and William patted it softly."
1506,A VALEDICTION.,Jim beamed on the company. Things were going well with his world.
1507,A VALEDICTION.,"Three of his more grossly incompetent men had died, and their places"
1508,A VALEDICTION.,had been filled by their betters. Every day brought the rains nearer.
1509,A VALEDICTION.,"They had put out the famine in five of the Eight Districts, and,"
1510,A VALEDICTION.,"after all, the death-rate had not been too heavy--things considered."
1511,A VALEDICTION.,"He looked Scott over carefully, as an ogre looks over a man, and"
1512,A VALEDICTION.,rejoiced in his thews and iron-hard condition.
1513,A VALEDICTION.,
1514,A VALEDICTION.,"'He's just the least bit in the world tucked up,' said Jim to"
1515,A VALEDICTION.,"himself, 'but he can do two men's work yet.' Then he was aware that"
1516,A VALEDICTION.,"Mrs. Jim was telegraphing to him, and according to the domestic code"
1517,A VALEDICTION.,the message ran: 'A clear case. Look at them!'
1518,A VALEDICTION.,
1519,A VALEDICTION.,He looked and listened. All that William was saying was: 'What can
1520,A VALEDICTION.,you expect of a country where they call a _bhistee_ [a water-carrier]
1521,A VALEDICTION.,a _tunni-cutch?_' and all that Scott answered was: 'I shall be
1522,A VALEDICTION.,precious glad to get back to the Club. Save me a dance at the
1523,A VALEDICTION.,"Christmas ball, won't you?'"
1524,A VALEDICTION.,
1525,A VALEDICTION.,"'It's a far cry from here to the Lawrence Hall,' said Jim. 'Better"
1526,A VALEDICTION.,"turn in early, Scott. It's paddy-carts to-morrow; you'll begin"
1527,A VALEDICTION.,loading at five.'
1528,A VALEDICTION.,
1529,A VALEDICTION.,'Aren't you going to give Mr. Scott one day's rest?'
1530,A VALEDICTION.,
1531,A VALEDICTION.,"'Wish I could, Lizzie. 'Fraid I can't. As long as he can stand up we"
1532,A VALEDICTION.,must use him.'
1533,A VALEDICTION.,
1534,A VALEDICTION.,"'Well, I've had one Europe evening, at least ... By Jove, I'd nearly"
1535,A VALEDICTION.,forgotten! What do I do about those babies of mine?'
1536,A VALEDICTION.,
1537,A VALEDICTION.,"'Leave them here,' said William--'we are in charge of that--and as"
1538,A VALEDICTION.,many goats as you can spare. I must learn how to milk now.'
1539,A VALEDICTION.,
1540,A VALEDICTION.,'If you care to get up early enough to-morrow I'll show you. I have
1541,A VALEDICTION.,"to milk, you see; and, by the way, half of em have beads and things"
1542,A VALEDICTION.,"round their necks. You must be careful not to take 'em off, in case"
1543,A VALEDICTION.,the mothers turn up.'
1544,A VALEDICTION.,
1545,A VALEDICTION.,'You forget I've had some experience here.'
1546,A VALEDICTION.,
1547,A VALEDICTION.,'I hope to goodness you won't overdo.' Scott's voice was unguarded.
1548,A VALEDICTION.,
1549,A VALEDICTION.,"'I'll take care of her,' said Mrs. Jim, telegraphing hundred-word"
1550,A VALEDICTION.,"messages as she carried William off, while Jim gave Scott his orders"
1551,A VALEDICTION.,for the coming campaign. It was very late--nearly nine o'clock.
1552,A VALEDICTION.,
1553,A VALEDICTION.,"'Jim, you're a brute,' said his wife, that night; and the Head of the"
1554,A VALEDICTION.,Famine chuckled.
1555,A VALEDICTION.,
1556,A VALEDICTION.,"'Not a bit of it, dear I remember doing the first Jandiala Settlement"
1557,A VALEDICTION.,"for the sake of a girl in a crinoline; and she was slender, Lizzie."
1558,A VALEDICTION.,I've never done as good a piece of work since. _He_'ll work like a
1559,A VALEDICTION.,demon.'
1560,A VALEDICTION.,
1561,A VALEDICTION.,'But you might have given him one day.'
1562,A VALEDICTION.,
1563,A VALEDICTION.,"'And let things come to a head now? No, dear; it's their happiest"
1564,A VALEDICTION.,time.'
1565,A VALEDICTION.,
1566,A VALEDICTION.,'I don't believe either of the dears know what's the matter with
1567,A VALEDICTION.,them. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it lovely?'
1568,A VALEDICTION.,
1569,A VALEDICTION.,"'Getting up at three to learn to milk, bless her heart! Ye gods, why"
1570,A VALEDICTION.,must we grow old and fat?'
1571,A VALEDICTION.,
1572,A VALEDICTION.,'She's a darling. She has done more work under me--'
1573,A VALEDICTION.,
1574,A VALEDICTION.,'Under _you!_ The day after she came she was in charge and you were
1575,A VALEDICTION.,"her subordinate, and you've stayed there ever since. She manages you"
1576,A VALEDICTION.,almost as well as you manage me.'
1577,A VALEDICTION.,
1578,A VALEDICTION.,"'She doesn't, and that's why I love her. She's as direct as a man-as"
1579,A VALEDICTION.,her brother.'
1580,A VALEDICTION.,
1581,A VALEDICTION.,'Her brother's weaker than she is. He's always coming to me for
1582,A VALEDICTION.,"orders; but he's honest, and a glutton for work. I confess I'm"
1583,A VALEDICTION.,"rather fond of William, and if I had a daughter--'"
1584,A VALEDICTION.,
1585,A VALEDICTION.,The talk ended there. Far away in the Derajat was a child's grave
1586,A VALEDICTION.,"more than twenty years old, and neither Jim nor his wife spoke of it"
1587,A VALEDICTION.,any more.
1588,A VALEDICTION.,
1589,A VALEDICTION.,"'All the same, you're responsible,' Jim added, after a moment's"
1590,A VALEDICTION.,silence.
1591,A VALEDICTION.,
1592,A VALEDICTION.,"'Bless 'em,' said Mrs. Jim, sleepily."
1593,A VALEDICTION.,
1594,A VALEDICTION.,"Before the stars paled, Scott, who slept in an empty cart, waked and"
1595,A VALEDICTION.,went about his work in silence; it seemed at that hour unkind to
1596,A VALEDICTION.,rouse Faiz Ullah and the interpreter. His head being close to the
1597,A VALEDICTION.,"ground, he did not hear William till she stood over him in the dingy"
1598,A VALEDICTION.,"old riding-habit, her eyes still heavy with sleep, a cup of tea and a"
1599,A VALEDICTION.,"piece of toast in her hands. There was a baby on the ground,"
1600,A VALEDICTION.,"squirming on a piece of blanket, and a six-year-old child peered over"
1601,A VALEDICTION.,Scott's shoulder.
1602,A VALEDICTION.,
1603,A VALEDICTION.,"'Hai, you little rip,' said Scott, 'how the deuce do you expect to"
1604,A VALEDICTION.,get your rations if you aren't quiet?'
1605,A VALEDICTION.,
1606,A VALEDICTION.,"A cool white hand steadied the brat, who forthwith choked as the milk"
1607,A VALEDICTION.,gurgled into his mouth.
1608,A VALEDICTION.,
1609,A VALEDICTION.,"'Mornin',' said the milker. 'You've no notion how these little"
1610,A VALEDICTION.,fellows can wriggle.'
1611,A VALEDICTION.,
1612,A VALEDICTION.,"'Oh, yes, I have.' She whispered, because the world was asleep. 'Only"
1613,A VALEDICTION.,I feed them with a spoon or a rag. Yours are fatter than mine....
1614,A VALEDICTION.,"And you've been doing this day after day, twice a day?' The voice was"
1615,A VALEDICTION.,almost lost.
1616,A VALEDICTION.,
1617,A VALEDICTION.,"'Yes; it was absurd. Now you try,' he said, giving place to the girl."
1618,A VALEDICTION.,'Look out! A goat's not a cow.'
1619,A VALEDICTION.,
1620,A VALEDICTION.,"The goat protested against the amateur, and there was a scuffle, in"
1621,A VALEDICTION.,"which Scott snatched up the baby. Then it was all to do over again,"
1622,A VALEDICTION.,"and William laughed softly and merrily. She managed, however, to feed"
1623,A VALEDICTION.,"two babies, and a third."
1624,A VALEDICTION.,
1625,A VALEDICTION.,'Don't the little beggars take it well!' said Scott. 'I trained 'em.'
1626,A VALEDICTION.,
1627,A VALEDICTION.,"They were very busy and interested, when, lo! it was broad daylight,"
1628,A VALEDICTION.,"and before they knew, the camp was awake, and they kneeled among the"
1629,A VALEDICTION.,"goats, surprised by the day, both flushed to the temples. Yet all the"
1630,A VALEDICTION.,round world rolling up out of the darkness might have heard and seen
1631,A VALEDICTION.,all that had passed between them.
1632,A VALEDICTION.,
1633,A VALEDICTION.,"'Oh,' said William, unsteadily, snatching up the tea and toast, 'I"
1634,A VALEDICTION.,had this made for you. It's stone-cold now. I thought you mightn't
1635,A VALEDICTION.,have anything ready so early. Better not drink it. It's--it's
1636,A VALEDICTION.,stone-cold.'
1637,A VALEDICTION.,
1638,A VALEDICTION.,'That's awfully kind of you. It's just right. It's awfully good of
1639,A VALEDICTION.,"you, really. I'll leave my kids and goats with you and Mrs. Jim; and,"
1640,A VALEDICTION.,"of course, any one in camp can show you about the milking.'"
1641,A VALEDICTION.,
1642,A VALEDICTION.,"'Of course,' said William; and she grew pinker and pinker and"
1643,A VALEDICTION.,"statelier and more stately, as she strode back to her tent, fanning"
1644,A VALEDICTION.,herself vigorously with the saucer.
1645,A VALEDICTION.,
1646,A VALEDICTION.,There were shrill lamentations through the camp when the elder
1647,A VALEDICTION.,children saw their nurse move off without them. Faiz Ullah unbent so
1648,A VALEDICTION.,"far as to jest with the policemen, and Scott turned purple with shame"
1649,A VALEDICTION.,"because Hawkins, already in the saddle, roared."
1650,A VALEDICTION.,
1651,A VALEDICTION.,"A child escaped from the care of Mrs. Jim, and, running like a"
1652,A VALEDICTION.,"rabbit, clung to Scott's boot, William pursuing with long, easy"
1653,A VALEDICTION.,strides.
1654,A VALEDICTION.,
1655,A VALEDICTION.,"'I will not go--I will not go!' shrieked the child, twining his feet"
1656,A VALEDICTION.,round Scott's ankle. 'They will kill me here. I do not know these
1657,A VALEDICTION.,people.'
1658,A VALEDICTION.,
1659,A VALEDICTION.,"'I say,' said Scott, in broken Tamil, 'I say, she will do you no"
1660,A VALEDICTION.,harm. Go with her and be well fed.'
1661,A VALEDICTION.,
1662,A VALEDICTION.,"'Come!' said William, panting, with a wrathful glance at Scott, who"
1663,A VALEDICTION.,"stood helpless and, as it were, hamstrung."
1664,A VALEDICTION.,
1665,A VALEDICTION.,"'Go back,' said Scott quickly to William. 'I'll send the little"
1666,A VALEDICTION.,chap over in a minute.'
1667,A VALEDICTION.,
1668,A VALEDICTION.,"The tone of authority had its effect, but in a way Scott did not"
1669,A VALEDICTION.,"exactly intend. The boy loosened his grasp, and said with gravity,"
1670,A VALEDICTION.,'I did not know the woman was thine. I will go.' Then he cried to
1671,A VALEDICTION.,"his companions, a mob of three-, four-, and five-year-olds waiting"
1672,A VALEDICTION.,on the success of his venture ere they stampeded: 'Go back and eat.
1673,A VALEDICTION.,It is our man's woman. She will obey his orders.'
1674,A VALEDICTION.,
1675,A VALEDICTION.,Jim collapsed where he sat; Faiz Ullah and the two policemen grinned;
1676,A VALEDICTION.,and Scott's orders to the cartmen flew like hail.
1677,A VALEDICTION.,
1678,A VALEDICTION.,'That is the custom of the Sahibs when truth is told in their
1679,A VALEDICTION.,"presence,' said Faiz Ullah. 'The time comes that I must seek new"
1680,A VALEDICTION.,"service. Young wives, especially such as speak our language and have"
1681,A VALEDICTION.,"knowledge of the ways of the Police, make great trouble for honest"
1682,A VALEDICTION.,butlers in the matter of weekly accounts.'
1683,A VALEDICTION.,
1684,A VALEDICTION.,"What William thought of it all she did not say, but when her brother,"
1685,A VALEDICTION.,"ten days later, came to camp for orders, and heard of Scott's"
1686,A VALEDICTION.,"performances, he said, laughing: 'Well, that settles it. He'll be"
1687,A VALEDICTION.,"_Bakri_ Scott to the end of his days' (_Bakri_, in the northern"
1688,A VALEDICTION.,"vernacular, means a goat). 'What a lark! I'd have given a month's pay"
1689,A VALEDICTION.,to have seen him nursing famine babies. I fed some with _conjee_
1690,A VALEDICTION.,"[rice-water], but that was all right.'"
1691,A VALEDICTION.,
1692,A VALEDICTION.,"'It's perfectly disgusting,' said his sister, with blazing eyes. 'A"
1693,A VALEDICTION.,man does something like--like that--and all you other men think of is
1694,A VALEDICTION.,"to give him an absurd nickname, and then you laugh and think it's"
1695,A VALEDICTION.,funny.'
1696,A VALEDICTION.,
1697,A VALEDICTION.,"'Ah,' said Mrs. Jim, sympathetically."
1698,A VALEDICTION.,
1699,A VALEDICTION.,"'Well, _you_ can't talk, William. You christened little Miss Demby"
1700,A VALEDICTION.,the Button-quail last cold weather; you know you did. India's the
1701,A VALEDICTION.,land of nicknames.'
1702,A VALEDICTION.,
1703,A VALEDICTION.,"That's different,' William replied. 'She was only a girl, and she"
1704,A VALEDICTION.,"hadn't done anything except walk like a quail, and she _does_. But it"
1705,A VALEDICTION.,isn't fair to make fun of a man.'
1706,A VALEDICTION.,
1707,A VALEDICTION.,"'Scott won't care,' said Martyn. 'You can't get a rise out of old"
1708,A VALEDICTION.,"Scotty. I've been trying for eight years, and you've only known him"
1709,A VALEDICTION.,for three. How does he look?'
1710,A VALEDICTION.,
1711,A VALEDICTION.,"'He looks very well,' said William, and went away with a flushed"
1712,A VALEDICTION.,"cheek. '_Bakri_ Scott, indeed!' Then she laughed to herself, for she"
1713,A VALEDICTION.,knew the country of her service. 'But it will be _Bakri_ all the
1714,A VALEDICTION.,"same'; and she repeated it under her breath several times slowly,"
1715,A VALEDICTION.,whispering it into favour.
1716,A VALEDICTION.,
1717,A VALEDICTION.,"When he returned to his duties on the railway, Martyn spread the name"
1718,A VALEDICTION.,"far and wide among his associates, so that Scott met it as he led his"
1719,A VALEDICTION.,paddy-carts to war. The natives believed it to be some English title
1720,A VALEDICTION.,"of honour, and the cart-drivers used it in all simplicity till Faiz"
1721,A VALEDICTION.,"Ullah, who did not approve of foreign japes, broke their heads. There"
1722,A VALEDICTION.,"was very little time for milking now, except at the big camps, where"
1723,A VALEDICTION.,"Jim had extended Scott's idea, and was feeding large flocks on the"
1724,A VALEDICTION.,useless northern grains. Enough paddy had come into the Eight
1725,A VALEDICTION.,"Districts to hold the people safe, if it were only distributed"
1726,A VALEDICTION.,quickly; and for that purpose no one was better than the big Canal
1727,A VALEDICTION.,"officer, who never lost his temper, never gave an unnecessary order,"
1728,A VALEDICTION.,"and never questioned an order given. Scott pressed on, saving his"
1729,A VALEDICTION.,"cattle, washing their galled necks daily, so that no time should be"
1730,A VALEDICTION.,lost on the road; reported himself with his rice at the minor
1731,A VALEDICTION.,"famine-sheds, unloaded, and went back light by forced night-march to"
1732,A VALEDICTION.,"the next distributing centre, to find Hawkins's unvarying telegram:"
1733,A VALEDICTION.,"'Do it again.' And he did it again and again, and yet again, while"
1734,A VALEDICTION.,"Jim Hawkins, fifty miles away, marked off on a big map the tracks of"
1735,A VALEDICTION.,his wheels gridironing the stricken lands. Others did well--Hawkins
1736,A VALEDICTION.,reported at the end that they all did well--but Scott was the most
1737,A VALEDICTION.,"excellent, for he kept good coined rupees by him, and paid for his"
1738,A VALEDICTION.,"own cart-repairs on the spot, and ran to meet all sorts of"
1739,A VALEDICTION.,"unconsidered extras, trusting to be recouped later. Theoretically,"
1740,A VALEDICTION.,"the Government should have paid for every shoe and linchpin, for"
1741,A VALEDICTION.,every hand employed in the loading; but Government vouchers cash
1742,A VALEDICTION.,"themselves slowly, and intelligent and efficient clerks write at"
1743,A VALEDICTION.,"great length, contesting unauthorised expenditures of eight annas."
1744,A VALEDICTION.,The man who wishes to make his work a success must draw on his own
1745,A VALEDICTION.,bank-account of money or other things as he goes.
1746,A VALEDICTION.,
1747,A VALEDICTION.,"'I told you he'd work,' said Jimmy to his wife at the end of six"
1748,A VALEDICTION.,weeks. 'He's been in sole charge of a couple of thousand men up north
1749,A VALEDICTION.,"on the Mosuhl Canal for a year, and he gives one less trouble than"
1750,A VALEDICTION.,young Martyn with his ten constables; and I'm morally certain--only
1751,A VALEDICTION.,Government doesn't recognise moral obligations--that he's spent about
1752,A VALEDICTION.,"half his pay to grease his wheels. Look at this, Lizzie, for one"
1753,A VALEDICTION.,week's work! Forty miles in two days with twelve carts; two days'
1754,A VALEDICTION.,halt building a famine-shed for young Rogers (Rogers ought to have
1755,A VALEDICTION.,"built it himself, the idiot!). Then forty miles back again, loading"
1756,A VALEDICTION.,"six carts on the way, and distributing all Sunday. Then in the"
1757,A VALEDICTION.,"evening he pitches in a twenty-page demi-official to me, saying that"
1758,A VALEDICTION.,"the people where he is might be ""advantageously employed on"
1759,A VALEDICTION.,"relief-work,"" and suggesting that he put 'em to work on some"
1760,A VALEDICTION.,"broken-down old reservoir he's discovered, so as to have a good"
1761,A VALEDICTION.,water-supply when the Rains come. He thinks he can caulk the dam in a
1762,A VALEDICTION.,fortnight. Look at his marginal sketches--aren't they clear and good?
1763,A VALEDICTION.,"I knew he was _pukka_, but I didn't know he was as _pukka_ as this!'"
1764,A VALEDICTION.,
1765,A VALEDICTION.,"'I must show these to William,' said Mrs. Jim. 'The child's wearing"
1766,A VALEDICTION.,herself out among the babies.'
1767,A VALEDICTION.,
1768,A VALEDICTION.,"'Not more than you are, dear. Well, another two months ought to see"
1769,A VALEDICTION.,us out of the wood. I'm sorry it's not in my power to recommend you
1770,A VALEDICTION.,for a V.C.'
1771,A VALEDICTION.,
1772,A VALEDICTION.,"William sat late in her tent that night, reading through page after"
1773,A VALEDICTION.,"page of the square handwriting, patting the sketches of proposed"
1774,A VALEDICTION.,"repairs to the reservoir, and wrinkling her eyebrows over the columns"
1775,A VALEDICTION.,of figures of estimated water-supply.
1776,A VALEDICTION.,
1777,A VALEDICTION.,"'And he finds time to do all this,' she cried to herself,"
1778,A VALEDICTION.,"'and ... well, I also was present. I've saved one or two babies.'"
1779,A VALEDICTION.,
1780,A VALEDICTION.,"She dreamed for the twentieth time of the god in the golden dust, and"
1781,A VALEDICTION.,"woke refreshed to feed loathsome black children, scores of them,"
1782,A VALEDICTION.,"wastrels picked up by the wayside, their bones almost breaking their"
1783,A VALEDICTION.,"skin, terrible and covered with sores."
1784,A VALEDICTION.,
1785,A VALEDICTION.,"Scott was not allowed to leave his cart work, but his letter was duly"
1786,A VALEDICTION.,"forwarded to the Government, and he had the consolation, not rare in"
1787,A VALEDICTION.,"India, of knowing that another man was reaping where he had sown."
1788,A VALEDICTION.,That also was discipline profitable to the soul.
1789,A VALEDICTION.,
1790,A VALEDICTION.,"'He's much too good to waste on canals,' said Jimmy. 'Any one can"
1791,A VALEDICTION.,"oversee coolies. You needn't be angry, William: he can--but I need my"
1792,A VALEDICTION.,"pearl among bullock-drivers, and I've transferred him to the Khanda"
1793,A VALEDICTION.,"district, where he'll have it all to do over again. He should be"
1794,A VALEDICTION.,marching now.'
1795,A VALEDICTION.,
1796,A VALEDICTION.,"'He's _not_ a coolie,' said William furiously. 'He ought to be doing"
1797,A VALEDICTION.,his regulation work.'
1798,A VALEDICTION.,
1799,A VALEDICTION.,"'He's the best man in his service, and that's saying a good deal; but"
1800,A VALEDICTION.,"if you _must_ use razors to cut grindstones, why, I prefer the best"
1801,A VALEDICTION.,cutlery.'
1802,A VALEDICTION.,
1803,A VALEDICTION.,'Isn't it almost time we saw him again?' said Mrs. Jim. 'I'm sure the
1804,A VALEDICTION.,poor boy hasn't had a respectable meal for a month. He probably sits
1805,A VALEDICTION.,on a cart and eats sardines with his fingers.'
1806,A VALEDICTION.,
1807,A VALEDICTION.,"'All in good time, dear. Duty before decency--wasn't it Mr. Chucks"
1808,A VALEDICTION.,said that?'
1809,A VALEDICTION.,
1810,A VALEDICTION.,"'No; it was Midshipman Easy,' William laughed. 'I sometimes wonder"
1811,A VALEDICTION.,"how it will feel to dance or listen to a band again, or sit under a"
1812,A VALEDICTION.,roof. I can't believe that I ever wore a ball-frock in my life.'
1813,A VALEDICTION.,
1814,A VALEDICTION.,"'One minute,' said Mrs. Jim, who was thinking. 'If he goes to Khanda,"
1815,A VALEDICTION.,he passes within five miles of us. Of course he'll ride in.'
1816,A VALEDICTION.,
1817,A VALEDICTION.,"'Oh, no, he won't,' said William."
1818,A VALEDICTION.,
1819,A VALEDICTION.,"'How do you know, dear?'"
1820,A VALEDICTION.,
1821,A VALEDICTION.,'It'll take him off his work. He won't have time.'
1822,A VALEDICTION.,
1823,A VALEDICTION.,"'He'll make it,' said Mrs. Jim, with a twinkle."
1824,A VALEDICTION.,
1825,A VALEDICTION.,'It depends on his own judgment. There's absolutely no reason why he
1826,A VALEDICTION.,"shouldn't, if he thinks fit,' said Jim."
1827,A VALEDICTION.,
1828,A VALEDICTION.,"'He won't see fit,' William replied, without sorrow or emotion. 'It"
1829,A VALEDICTION.,wouldn't be him if he did.'
1830,A VALEDICTION.,
1831,A VALEDICTION.,"'One certainly gets to know people rather well in times like these,'"
1832,A VALEDICTION.,"said Jim, drily; but William's face was serene as ever, and, even as"
1833,A VALEDICTION.,"she prophesied, Scott did not appear."
1834,A VALEDICTION.,
1835,A VALEDICTION.,"The Rains fell at last, late, but heavily; and the dry, gashed earth"
1836,A VALEDICTION.,"was red mud, and servants killed snakes in the camp, where every one"
1837,A VALEDICTION.,"was weather-bound for a fortnight--all except Hawkins, who took horse"
1838,A VALEDICTION.,"and splashed about in the wet, rejoicing. Now the Government decreed"
1839,A VALEDICTION.,"that seed-grain should be distributed to the people, as well as"
1840,A VALEDICTION.,advances of money for the purchase of new oxen; and the white men
1841,A VALEDICTION.,"were doubly worked for this new duty, while William skipped from"
1842,A VALEDICTION.,"brick to brick laid down on the trampled mud, and dosed her charges"
1843,A VALEDICTION.,with warming medicines that made them rub their little round
1844,A VALEDICTION.,stomachs; and the milch-goats throve on the rank grass. There was
1845,A VALEDICTION.,"never a word from Scott in the Khanda district, away to the"
1846,A VALEDICTION.,"south-east, except the regular telegraphic report to Hawkins. The"
1847,A VALEDICTION.,rude country roads had disappeared; his drivers were half mutinous;
1848,A VALEDICTION.,one of Martyn's loaned policemen had died of cholera; and Scott was
1849,A VALEDICTION.,taking thirty grains of quinine a day to fight the fever that comes
1850,A VALEDICTION.,if one works hard in heavy rain; but those were things he did not
1851,A VALEDICTION.,"consider necessary to report. He was, as usual, working from a base"
1852,A VALEDICTION.,"of supplies on a railway line, to cover a circle of fifteen miles"
1853,A VALEDICTION.,"radius, and since full loads were impossible, he took  quarter-loads,"
1854,A VALEDICTION.,and toiled four times as hard by consequence; for he did not choose
1855,A VALEDICTION.,to risk an epidemic which might have grown uncontrollable by
1856,A VALEDICTION.,assembling villagers in thousands at the relief-sheds. It was cheaper
1857,A VALEDICTION.,"to take Government bullocks, work them to death, and leave them to"
1858,A VALEDICTION.,the crows in the wayside sloughs.
1859,A VALEDICTION.,
1860,A VALEDICTION.,That was the time when eight years of clean living and hard condition
1861,A VALEDICTION.,"told, though a man's head were ringing like a bell from the cinchona,"
1862,A VALEDICTION.,and the earth swayed under his feet when he stood and under his bed
1863,A VALEDICTION.,"when he slept. If Hawkins had seen fit to make him a bullock-driver,"
1864,A VALEDICTION.,"that, he thought, was entirely Hawkins's own affair. There were men"
1865,A VALEDICTION.,in the North who would know what he had done; men of thirty years'
1866,A VALEDICTION.,service in his own department who would say that it was 'not half
1867,A VALEDICTION.,"bad'; and above, immeasurably above all men of all grades, there was"
1868,A VALEDICTION.,"William in the thick of the fight, who would approve because she"
1869,A VALEDICTION.,understood. He had so trained his mind that it would hold fast to the
1870,A VALEDICTION.,"mechanical routine of the day, though his own voice sounded strange"
1871,A VALEDICTION.,"in his own ears, and his hands, when he wrote, grew large as pillows"
1872,A VALEDICTION.,or small as peas at the end of his wrists. That steadfastness bore
1873,A VALEDICTION.,"his body to the telegraph-office at the railway-station, and dictated"
1874,A VALEDICTION.,"a telegram to Hawkins, saying that the Khanda district was, in his"
1875,A VALEDICTION.,"judgment, now safe, and he 'waited further orders.'"
1876,A VALEDICTION.,
1877,A VALEDICTION.,"The Madrassee telegraph-clerk did not approve of a large, gaunt man"
1878,A VALEDICTION.,"falling over him in a dead faint, not so much because of the weight,"
1879,A VALEDICTION.,as because of the names and blows that Faiz Ullah dealt him when he
1880,A VALEDICTION.,found the body rolled under a bench. Then Faiz Ullah took blankets
1881,A VALEDICTION.,"and quilts and coverlets where he found them, and lay down under them"
1882,A VALEDICTION.,"at his master's side, and bound his arms with a tent-rope, and filled"
1883,A VALEDICTION.,"him with a horrible stew of herbs, and set the policeman to fight him"
1884,A VALEDICTION.,"when he wished to escape from the intolerable heat of his coverings,"
1885,A VALEDICTION.,and shut the door of the telegraph-office to keep out the curious for
1886,A VALEDICTION.,"two nights and one day; and when a light engine came down the line,"
1887,A VALEDICTION.,"and Hawkins kicked in the door, Scott hailed him weakly, but in a"
1888,A VALEDICTION.,"natural voice, and Faiz Ullah stood back and took all the credit."
1889,A VALEDICTION.,
1890,A VALEDICTION.,"'For two nights, Heaven-born, he was _pagal_' said Faiz Ullah. 'Look"
1891,A VALEDICTION.,"at my nose, and consider the eye of the policeman. He beat us with"
1892,A VALEDICTION.,"his bound hands; but we sat upon him, Heaven-born, and though his"
1893,A VALEDICTION.,"words were _tez_, we sweated him. Heaven-born, never has been such a"
1894,A VALEDICTION.,sweat! He is weaker now than a child; but the fever has gone out of
1895,A VALEDICTION.,"him, by the grace of God. There remains only my nose and the eye of"
1896,A VALEDICTION.,"the constabeel. Sahib, shall I ask for my dismissal because my Sahib"
1897,A VALEDICTION.,has beaten me?' And Faiz Ullah laid his long thin hand carefully on
1898,A VALEDICTION.,"Scott's chest to be sure that the fever was all gone, ere he went out"
1899,A VALEDICTION.,to open tinned soups and discourage such as laughed at his swelled
1900,A VALEDICTION.,nose.
1901,A VALEDICTION.,
1902,A VALEDICTION.,"'The district's all right,' Scott whispered. 'It doesn't make any"
1903,A VALEDICTION.,difference. You got my wire? I shall be fit in a week. 'Can't
1904,A VALEDICTION.,understand how it happened. I shall be fit in a few days.'
1905,A VALEDICTION.,
1906,A VALEDICTION.,"'You're coming into camp with us,' said Hawkins."
1907,A VALEDICTION.,
1908,A VALEDICTION.,'But look here--but--'
1909,A VALEDICTION.,
1910,A VALEDICTION.,'It's all over except the shouting. We sha'n't need you Punjabis any
1911,A VALEDICTION.,"more. On my honour, we sha'n't. Martyn goes back in a few weeks;"
1912,A VALEDICTION.,Arbuthnot's returned already; Ellis and Clay are putting the last
1913,A VALEDICTION.,touches to a new feeder-line the Government's built as relief-work.
1914,A VALEDICTION.,"Morten's dead--he was a Bengal man, though; you wouldn't know him."
1915,A VALEDICTION.,"'Pon my word, you and Will--Miss Martyn--seem to have come through it"
1916,A VALEDICTION.,as well as anybody.'
1917,A VALEDICTION.,
1918,A VALEDICTION.,"'Oh, how is she?' The voice went up and down as he spoke."
1919,A VALEDICTION.,
1920,A VALEDICTION.,'She was in great form when I left her. The Roman Catholic Missions
1921,A VALEDICTION.,are adopting the unclaimed babies to turn them into little priests;
1922,A VALEDICTION.,"the Basil Mission is taking some, and the mothers are taking the"
1923,A VALEDICTION.,rest. You should hear the little beggars howl when they're sent away
1924,A VALEDICTION.,"from William. She's pulled down a bit, but so are we all. Now, when"
1925,A VALEDICTION.,do you suppose you'll be able to move?'
1926,A VALEDICTION.,
1927,A VALEDICTION.,"'I can't come into camp in this state. I won't,' he replied"
1928,A VALEDICTION.,pettishly.
1929,A VALEDICTION.,
1930,A VALEDICTION.,"'Well, you _are_ rather a sight, but from what I gathered there it"
1931,A VALEDICTION.,seemed to me they'd be glad to see you under any conditions. I'll
1932,A VALEDICTION.,"look over your work here, if you like, for a couple of days, and you"
1933,A VALEDICTION.,can pull yourself together while Faiz Ullah feeds you up.'
1934,A VALEDICTION.,
1935,A VALEDICTION.,"Scott could walk dizzily by the time Hawkins's inspection vas ended,"
1936,A VALEDICTION.,and he flushed all over when Jim said of his work in the district
1937,A VALEDICTION.,"that it was 'not half bad,' and volunteered, further, that he had"
1938,A VALEDICTION.,"considered Scott his right-hand man through the famine, and would"
1939,A VALEDICTION.,feel it his duty to say as much officially.
1940,A VALEDICTION.,
1941,A VALEDICTION.,So they came back by rail to the old camp; but there were no crowds
1942,A VALEDICTION.,"near it, the long fires in the trenches were dead and black, and the"
1943,A VALEDICTION.,famine-sheds stood almost empty.
1944,A VALEDICTION.,
1945,A VALEDICTION.,'You see!' said Jim. 'There isn't much more for us to do. Better ride
1946,A VALEDICTION.,up and see the wife. They've pitched a tent for you. Dinner's at
1947,A VALEDICTION.,seven. I'll see you then.'
1948,A VALEDICTION.,
1949,A VALEDICTION.,"Riding at a foot-pace, Faiz Ullah by his stirrup, Scott came to"
1950,A VALEDICTION.,"William in the brown-calico riding-habit, sitting at the dining-tent"
1951,A VALEDICTION.,"door, her hands in her lap, white as ashes, thin and worn, with no"
1952,A VALEDICTION.,lustre in her hair. There did not seem to be any Mrs. Jim on the
1953,A VALEDICTION.,"horizon, and all that William could say was: 'My word, how pulled"
1954,A VALEDICTION.,down you look!'
1955,A VALEDICTION.,
1956,A VALEDICTION.,'I've had a touch of fever. You don't look very well yourself.'
1957,A VALEDICTION.,
1958,A VALEDICTION.,"'Oh, I'm fit enough. We've stamped it out. I suppose you know?'"
1959,A VALEDICTION.,
1960,A VALEDICTION.,Scott nodded. 'We shall all be returned in a few weeks. Hawkins told
1961,A VALEDICTION.,me.'
1962,A VALEDICTION.,
1963,A VALEDICTION.,"'Before Christmas, Mrs. Jim says. Sha'n't you be glad to go back? I"
1964,A VALEDICTION.,can smell the wood-smoke already'; William sniffed. 'We shall be in
1965,A VALEDICTION.,time for all the Christmas doings. I don't suppose even the Punjab
1966,A VALEDICTION.,Government would be base enough to transfer Jack till the new year?'
1967,A VALEDICTION.,
1968,A VALEDICTION.,'It seems hundreds of years ago--the Punjab and all that--doesn't it?
1969,A VALEDICTION.,Are you glad you came?'
1970,A VALEDICTION.,
1971,A VALEDICTION.,"'Now it's all over, yes. It has been ghastly here. You know we had to"
1972,A VALEDICTION.,"sit still and do nothing, and Sir Jim was away so much.'"
1973,A VALEDICTION.,
1974,A VALEDICTION.,'Do nothing! How did you get on with the milking?'
1975,A VALEDICTION.,
1976,A VALEDICTION.,'I managed it somehow--after you taught me.'
1977,A VALEDICTION.,
1978,A VALEDICTION.,Then the talk stopped with an almost audible jar. Still no Mrs. Jim.
1979,A VALEDICTION.,
1980,A VALEDICTION.,'That reminds me I owe you fifty rupees for the condensed milk. I
1981,A VALEDICTION.,thought perhaps you'd be coming here when you were transferred to the
1982,A VALEDICTION.,"Khanda district, and I could pay you then; but you didn't.'"
1983,A VALEDICTION.,
1984,A VALEDICTION.,'I passed within five miles of the camp. It was in the middle of a
1985,A VALEDICTION.,"march, you see, and the carts were breaking down every few minutes,"
1986,A VALEDICTION.,and I couldn't get 'em over the ground till ten o'clock that night.
1987,A VALEDICTION.,"But I wanted to come awfully. You knew I did, didn't you?'"
1988,A VALEDICTION.,
1989,A VALEDICTION.,"'I--believe--I--did,' said William, facing him with level eyes. She"
1990,A VALEDICTION.,was no longer white.
1991,A VALEDICTION.,
1992,A VALEDICTION.,'Did you understand?'
1993,A VALEDICTION.,
1994,A VALEDICTION.,"'Why you didn't ride in? Of course I did,'"
1995,A VALEDICTION.,
1996,A VALEDICTION.,'Why?'
1997,A VALEDICTION.,
1998,A VALEDICTION.,'Because you couldn't of course. I knew that.'
1999,A VALEDICTION.,
2000,A VALEDICTION.,'Did you care?'
2001,A VALEDICTION.,
2002,A VALEDICTION.,"'If you had come in--but I knew you wouldn't--but if you _had_, I"
2003,A VALEDICTION.,should have cared a great deal. You know I should.'
2004,A VALEDICTION.,
2005,A VALEDICTION.,"'Thank God I didn't! Oh, but I wanted to! I couldn't trust myself to"
2006,A VALEDICTION.,"ride in front of the carts, because I kept edging 'em over here,"
2007,A VALEDICTION.,don't you know?'
2008,A VALEDICTION.,
2009,A VALEDICTION.,"'I knew you wouldn't,' said William, contentedly, 'Here's your"
2010,A VALEDICTION.,fifty.'
2011,A VALEDICTION.,
2012,A VALEDICTION.,Scott bent forward and kissed the hand that held the greasy notes.
2013,A VALEDICTION.,Its fellow patted him awkwardly but very tenderly on the head.
2014,A VALEDICTION.,
2015,A VALEDICTION.,"'And _you_ knew, too, didn't you?' said William, in a new voice."
2016,A VALEDICTION.,
2017,A VALEDICTION.,"'No, on my honour, I didn't. I hadn't the--the cheek to expect"
2018,A VALEDICTION.,"anything of the kind, except... I say, were you out riding anywhere"
2019,A VALEDICTION.,the day I passed by to Khanda?'
2020,A VALEDICTION.,
2021,A VALEDICTION.,"William nodded, and smiled after the manner of an angel surprised"
2022,A VALEDICTION.,in a good deed.
2023,A VALEDICTION.,
2024,A VALEDICTION.,'Then it was just a speck I saw of your habit in the--'
2025,A VALEDICTION.,
2026,A VALEDICTION.,'Palm-grove on the Southern cart-road. I saw your helmet when you
2027,A VALEDICTION.,came up from the nullah by the temple--just enough to be sure that
2028,A VALEDICTION.,you were all right. D'you care?'
2029,A VALEDICTION.,
2030,A VALEDICTION.,"This time Scott did not kiss her hand, for they were in the dusk of"
2031,A VALEDICTION.,"the dining-tent, and, because William's knees were trembling under"
2032,A VALEDICTION.,"her, she had to sit down in the nearest chair, where she wept long"
2033,A VALEDICTION.,"and happily, her head on her arms; and when Scott imagined that it"
2034,A VALEDICTION.,"would be well to comfort her, she needed nothing of the kind; she ran"
2035,A VALEDICTION.,"to her own tent; and Scott went out into the world, and smiled upon"
2036,A VALEDICTION.,"it largely and idiotically. But when Faiz Ullah brought him a drink,"
2037,A VALEDICTION.,"he found it necessary to support one hand with the other, or the good"
2038,A VALEDICTION.,whisky and soda would have been spilled abroad. There are fevers and
2039,A VALEDICTION.,fevers.
2040,A VALEDICTION.,
2041,A VALEDICTION.,"But it was worse--much worse--the strained, eye-shirking talk at"
2042,A VALEDICTION.,"dinner till the servants had withdrawn, and worst of all when Mrs."
2043,A VALEDICTION.,"Jim, who had been on the edge of weeping from the soup down, kissed"
2044,A VALEDICTION.,"Scott and William, and they drank one whole bottle of champagne, hot,"
2045,A VALEDICTION.,"because there was no ice, and Scott and William sat outside the tent"
2046,A VALEDICTION.,in the starlight till Mrs. Jim drove them in for fear of more fever.
2047,A VALEDICTION.,
2048,A VALEDICTION.,Apropos of these things and some others William said: 'Being engaged
2049,A VALEDICTION.,"is abominable, because, you see, one has no official position. We"
2050,A VALEDICTION.,must be thankful that we've lots of things to do.'
2051,A VALEDICTION.,
2052,A VALEDICTION.,"'Things to do!' said Jim, when that was reported to him. 'They're"
2053,A VALEDICTION.,neither of them any good any more. I can't get five hours' work a day
2054,A VALEDICTION.,out of Scott. He's in the clouds half the time.'
2055,A VALEDICTION.,
2056,A VALEDICTION.,"'Oh, but they're so beautiful to watch, Jimmy. It will break my heart"
2057,A VALEDICTION.,when they go. Can't you do anything for him?'
2058,A VALEDICTION.,
2059,A VALEDICTION.,"'I've given the Government the impression--at least, I hope I"
2060,A VALEDICTION.,have--that he personally conducted the entire famine. But all he
2061,A VALEDICTION.,"wants is to get on to the Luni Canal Works, and William's just as"
2062,A VALEDICTION.,bad. Have you ever heard 'em talking of barrage and aprons and
2063,A VALEDICTION.,"wastewater. It's their style of spooning, I suppose.'"
2064,A VALEDICTION.,
2065,A VALEDICTION.,"Mrs. Jim smiled tenderly. 'Ah, that's in the intervals--bless 'em.'"
2066,A VALEDICTION.,
2067,A VALEDICTION.,"And so Love ran about the camp unrebuked in broad daylight, while men"
2068,A VALEDICTION.,picked up the pieces and put them neatly away of the Famine in the
2069,A VALEDICTION.,Eight Districts.
2070,A VALEDICTION.,
2071,A VALEDICTION.,*       *       *       *       *
2072,A VALEDICTION.,
2073,A VALEDICTION.,"Morning brought the penetrating chill of the Northern December, the"
2074,A VALEDICTION.,"layers of wood-smoke, the dusty gray blue of the tamarisks, the domes"
2075,A VALEDICTION.,"of ruined tombs, and all the smell of the white Northern plains, as"
2076,A VALEDICTION.,"the mail-train ran on to the mile-long Sutlej Bridge. William,"
2077,A VALEDICTION.,wrapped in a _poshteen_--silk-embroidered sheepskin jacket trimmed
2078,A VALEDICTION.,with rough astrakhan--looked out with moist eyes and nostrils that
2079,A VALEDICTION.,"dilated joyously. The South of pagodas and palm-trees, the"
2080,A VALEDICTION.,"over-populated Hindu South, was done with. Here was the land she knew"
2081,A VALEDICTION.,"and loved, and before her lay the good life she understood, among"
2082,A VALEDICTION.,folk of her own caste and mind.
2083,A VALEDICTION.,
2084,A VALEDICTION.,They were picking them up at almost every station now--men and women
2085,A VALEDICTION.,"coming in for the Christmas Week, with racquets, with bundles of"
2086,A VALEDICTION.,"polo-sticks, with dear and bruised cricket-bats, with fox-terriers"
2087,A VALEDICTION.,"and saddles. The greater part of them wore jackets like William's,"
2088,A VALEDICTION.,for the Northern cold is as little to be trifled with as the
2089,A VALEDICTION.,"Northern heat. And William was among them and of them, her hands"
2090,A VALEDICTION.,"deep in her pockets, her collar turned up over her ears, stamping her"
2091,A VALEDICTION.,"feet on the platforms as she walked up and down to get warm, visiting"
2092,A VALEDICTION.,"from carriage to carriage, and everywhere being congratulated. Scott"
2093,A VALEDICTION.,"was with the bachelors at the far end of the train, where they"
2094,A VALEDICTION.,chaffed him mercilessly about feeding babies and milking goats; but
2095,A VALEDICTION.,"from time to time he would stroll up to William's window, and murmur:"
2096,A VALEDICTION.,"'Good enough, isn't it?' and William would answer, with sighs of pure"
2097,A VALEDICTION.,"delight: 'Good enough, indeed.' The large open names of the home"
2098,A VALEDICTION.,"towns were good to listen to. Umballa, Ludianah, Phillour, Jullundur,"
2099,A VALEDICTION.,"they rang like the coming marriage-bells in her ears, and William"
2100,A VALEDICTION.,felt deeply and truly sorry for all strangers and
2101,A VALEDICTION.,"outsiders--visitors, tourists, and those fresh-caught for the service"
2102,A VALEDICTION.,of the country.
2103,A VALEDICTION.,
2104,A VALEDICTION.,"It was a glorious return, and when the bachelors gave the Christmas"
2105,A VALEDICTION.,"ball, William was, unofficially, you might say, the chief and"
2106,A VALEDICTION.,"honoured guest among the stewards, who could make things very"
2107,A VALEDICTION.,pleasant for their friends. She and Scott danced nearly all the
2108,A VALEDICTION.,"dances together, and sat out the rest in the big dark gallery"
2109,A VALEDICTION.,"overlooking the superb teak floor, where the uniforms blazed, and the"
2110,A VALEDICTION.,"spurs clinked, and the new frocks and four hundred dancers went round"
2111,A VALEDICTION.,and round till the draped flags on the pillars flapped and bellied to
2112,A VALEDICTION.,the whirl of it.
2113,A VALEDICTION.,
2114,A VALEDICTION.,About midnight half a dozen men who did not care for dancing came
2115,A VALEDICTION.,"over from the Club to play 'Waits,' and--that was a surprise the"
2116,A VALEDICTION.,"stewards had arranged--before any one knew what had happened, the"
2117,A VALEDICTION.,"band stopped, and hidden voices broke into 'Good King Wenceslaus,'"
2118,A VALEDICTION.,and William in the gallery hummed and beat time with her foot:
2119,A VALEDICTION.,
2120,A VALEDICTION.,"Mark my footsteps well, my page,"
2121,A VALEDICTION.,"Tread thou in them boldly,"
2122,A VALEDICTION.,Thou shalt feel the winter's rage
2123,A VALEDICTION.,Freeze thy blood less coldly!
2124,A VALEDICTION.,
2125,A VALEDICTION.,"'Oh, I hope they are going to give us another! Isn't it pretty,"
2126,A VALEDICTION.,coming out of the dark in that way? Look--look down. There's Mrs.
2127,A VALEDICTION.,Gregory wiping her eyes!'
2128,A VALEDICTION.,
2129,A VALEDICTION.,"'It's like home, rather,' said Scott. 'I remember--"
2130,A VALEDICTION.,
2131,A VALEDICTION.,'H'sh! Listen!--dear.'And it began again:
2132,A VALEDICTION.,
2133,A VALEDICTION.,When shepherds watched their flocks by night--
2134,A VALEDICTION.,
2135,A VALEDICTION.,"'A-h-h!' said William, drawing closer to Scott."
2136,A VALEDICTION.,
2137,A VALEDICTION.,"All seated on the ground,"
2138,A VALEDICTION.,"The Angel of the Lord came down,"
2139,A VALEDICTION.,And glory shone around.
2140,A VALEDICTION.,"'Fear not,' said he (for mighty dread."
2141,A VALEDICTION.,Had seized their troubled mind);
2142,A VALEDICTION.,'Glad tidings of great joy I bring
2143,A VALEDICTION.,To you and all mankind.'
2144,A VALEDICTION.,
2145,A VALEDICTION.,This time it was William that wiped her eyes.

2152,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN
2153,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2154,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"His full name was Percival William Williams, but he picked up the"
2155,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"other name in a nursery-book, and that was the end of the christened"
2156,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"titles. His mother's _ayah_ called him Willie-_Baba_, but as he never"
2157,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"paid the faintest attention to anything that the _ayah_ said, her"
2158,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,wisdom did not help matters.
2159,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2160,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"His father was the Colonel of the 195th, and as soon as Wee Willie"
2161,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Winkie was old enough to understand what Military Discipline meant,"
2162,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Colonel Williams put him under it. There was no other way of managing
2163,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the child. When he was good for a week, he drew good-conduct pay; and"
2164,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"when he was bad, he was deprived of his good-conduct stripe."
2165,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Generally he was bad, for India offers many chances of going wrong to"
2166,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,little six-year-olds.
2167,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2168,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Children resent familiarity from strangers, and Wee Willie Winkie was"
2169,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"a very particular child. Once he accepted an acquaintance, he was"
2170,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"graciously pleased to thaw. He accepted Brandis, a subaltern of the"
2171,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"195th, on sight. Brandis was having tea at the Colonel's, and Wee"
2172,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Willie Winkie entered strong in the possession of a good-conduct
2173,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,badge won for not chasing the hens round the compound. He regarded
2174,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Brandis with gravity for at least ten minutes, and then delivered"
2175,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,himself of his opinion.
2176,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2177,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I like you,' said he slowly, getting off his chair and coming over"
2178,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"to Brandis. 'I like you. I shall call you Coppy, because of your"
2179,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"hair. Do you _mind_ being called Coppy? It is because of ve hair, you"
2180,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,know.'
2181,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2182,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Here was one of the most embarrassing of Wee Willie Winkie's
2183,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"peculiarities. He would look at a stranger for some time, and then,"
2184,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"without warning or explanation, would give him a name. And the name"
2185,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,stuck. No regimental penalties could break Wee Willie Winkie of this
2186,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,habit. He lost his good-conduct badge for christening the
2187,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Commissioner's wife 'Pobs'; but nothing that the Colonel could do
2188,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"made the Station forego the nickname, and Mrs. Collen remained 'Pobs'"
2189,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"till the end of her stay. So Brandis was christened 'Coppy,' and"
2190,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"rose, therefore, in the estimation of the regiment."
2191,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2192,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"If Wee Willie Winkie took an interest in any one, the fortunate man"
2193,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,was envied alike by the mess and the rank and file. And in their envy
2194,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,lay no suspicion of self-interest. 'The Colonel's son' was idolised
2195,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,on his own merits entirely. Yet Wee Willie Winkie was not lovely. His
2196,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"face was permanently freckled, as his legs were permanently"
2197,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"scratched, and in spite of his mother's almost tearful remonstrances"
2198,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,he had insisted upon having his long yellow locks cut short in the
2199,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"military fashion. 'I want my hair like Sergeant Tummil's,' said Wee"
2200,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Willie Winkie, and, his father abetting, the sacrifice was"
2201,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,accomplished.
2202,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2203,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Three weeks after the bestowal of his youthful affections on
2204,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Lieutenant Brandis--henceforward to be called 'Coppy' for the sake of
2205,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,brevity--Wee Willie Winkie was destined to behold strange things and
2206,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,far beyond his comprehension.
2207,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2208,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Coppy returned his liking with interest. Coppy had let him wear for
2209,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,five rapturous minutes his own big sword--just as tall as Wee Willie
2210,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Winkie. Coppy had promised him a terrier puppy; and Coppy had
2211,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"permitted him to witness the miraculous operation of shaving. Nay,"
2212,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"more--Coppy had said that even he, Wee Willie Winkie, would rise in"
2213,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"time to the ownership of a box of shiny knives, a silver soap-box,"
2214,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"and a silver-handled 'sputter-brush,' as Wee Willie Winkie called it."
2215,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Decidedly, there was no one except his father, who could give or take"
2216,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"away good-conduct badges at pleasure, half so wise, strong, and"
2217,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,valiant as Coppy with the Afghan and Egyptian medals on his breast.
2218,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Why, then, should Coppy be guilty of the unmanly weakness of"
2219,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"kissing--vehemently kissing--a 'big girl,' Miss Allardyce to wit? In"
2220,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the course of a morning ride, Wee Willie Winkie had seen Coppy so"
2221,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"doing, and, like the gentleman he was, had promptly wheeled round and"
2222,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"cantered back to his groom, lest the groom should also see."
2223,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2224,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Under ordinary circumstances he would have spoken to his father, but"
2225,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,he felt instinctively that this was a matter on which Coppy ought
2226,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,first to be consulted.
2227,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2228,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Coppy,' shouted Wee Willie Winkie, reining up outside that"
2229,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"subaltern's bungalow early one morning--'I want to see you, Coppy!'"
2230,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2231,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Come in, young 'un,' returned Coppy, who was at early breakfast in"
2232,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,the midst of his dogs. 'What mischief have you been getting into
2233,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,now?'
2234,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2235,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Wee Willie Winkie had done nothing notoriously bad for three days,"
2236,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,and so stood on a pinnacle of virtue.
2237,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2238,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'_I've_ been doing nothing bad,' said he, curling himself into a"
2239,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,long chair with a studious affectation of the Colonel's languor after
2240,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"a hot parade. He buried his freckled nose in a tea-cup and, with eyes"
2241,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"staring roundly over the rim, asked: 'I say, Coppy, is it pwoper to"
2242,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,kiss big girls?'
2243,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2244,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'By Jove! You're beginning early. Who do you want to kiss?'
2245,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2246,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'No one. My muvver's always kissing me if I don't stop her. If it
2247,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"isn't pwoper, how was you kissing Major Allardyce's big girl last"
2248,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"morning, by ve canal?'"
2249,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2250,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Coppy's brow wrinkled. He and Miss Allardyce had with great craft
2251,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,managed to keep their engagement secret for a fortnight. There were
2252,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,urgent and imperative reasons why Major Allardyce should not know
2253,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"how matters stood for at least another month, and this small marplot"
2254,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,had discovered a great deal too much.
2255,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2256,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I saw you,' said Wee Willie Winkie calmly. 'But ve _sais_ didn't"
2257,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"see. I said, ""_Hut jao_!""'"
2258,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2259,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Oh, you had that much sense, you young Rip,' groaned poor Coppy,"
2260,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,half amused and half angry. 'And how many people may you have told
2261,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,about it?'
2262,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2263,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Only me myself. You didn't tell when I twied to wide ve buffalo ven
2264,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,my pony was lame; and I fought you wouldn't like.'
2265,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2266,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Winkie,' said Coppy enthusiastically, shaking the small hand,"
2267,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'you're the best of good fellows. Look here, you can't understand all"
2268,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"these things. One of these days--hang it, how can I make you see"
2269,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"it!--I'm going to marry Miss Allardyce, and then she'll be Mrs."
2270,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Coppy, as you say. If your young mind is so scandalised at the idea"
2271,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"of kissing big girls, go and tell your father.'"
2272,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2273,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'What will happen?' said Wee Willie Winkie, who firmly believed that"
2274,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,his father was omnipotent.
2275,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2276,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I shall get into trouble,' said Coppy, playing his trump card with"
2277,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,an appealing look at the holder of the ace.
2278,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2279,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Ven I won't,' said Wee Willie Winkie briefly. 'But my faver says"
2280,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"it's un-man-ly to be always kissing, and I didn't fink _you'd_ do"
2281,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"vat, Coppy.'"
2282,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2283,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I'm not always kissing, old chap. It's only now and then, and when"
2284,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,you're bigger you'll do it too. Your father meant it's not good for
2285,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,little boys.'
2286,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2287,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Ah!' said Wee Willie Winkie, now fully enlightened. 'It's like ve"
2288,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,sputter-brush?'
2289,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2290,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Exactly,' said Coppy gravely."
2291,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2292,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'But I don't fink I'll ever want to kiss big girls, nor no one, 'cept"
2293,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"my muvver. And I _must_ vat, you know.'"
2294,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2295,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"There was a long pause, broken by Wee Willie Winkie."
2296,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2297,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Are you fond of vis big girl, Coppy?'"
2298,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2299,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Awfully!' said Coppy.
2300,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2301,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Fonder van you are of Bell or ve Butcha--or me?'
2302,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2303,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'It's in a different way,' said Coppy. 'You see, one of these days"
2304,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Miss Allardyce will belong to me, but you'll grow up and command the"
2305,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Regiment and--all sorts of things. It's quite different, you see.'"
2306,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2307,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Very well,' said Wee Willie Winkie, rising. 'If you're fond of ve"
2308,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"big girl, I won't tell any one. I must go now.'"
2309,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2310,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Coppy rose and escorted his small guest to the door, adding--'You're"
2311,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the best of little fellows, Winkie. I tell you what. In thirty days"
2312,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,from now you can tell if you like--tell any one you like.'
2313,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2314,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Thus the secret of the Brandis-Allardyce engagement was dependent on
2315,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"a little child's word. Coppy, who knew Wee Willie Winkie's idea of"
2316,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"truth, was at ease, for he felt that he would not break promises. Wee"
2317,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Willie Winkie betrayed a special and unusual interest in Miss
2318,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Allardyce, and, slowly revolving round that embarrassed young lady,"
2319,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,was used to regard her gravely with unwinking eye. He was trying to
2320,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,discover why Coppy should have kissed her. She was not half so nice
2321,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"as his own mother. On the other hand, she was Coppy's property, and"
2322,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,would in time belong to him. Therefore it behoved him to treat her
2323,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,with as much respect as Coppy's big sword or shiny pistol.
2324,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2325,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,The idea that he shared a great secret in common with Coppy kept Wee
2326,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Willie Winkie unusually virtuous for three weeks. Then the Old Adam
2327,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"broke out, and he made what he called a 'camp-fire' at the bottom of"
2328,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,the garden. How could he have foreseen that the flying sparks would
2329,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,have lighted the Colonel's little hay-rick and consumed a week's
2330,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,store for the horses? Sudden and swift was the
2331,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"punishment--deprivation of the good-conduct badge and, most sorrowful"
2332,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"of all, two days' confinement to barracks--the house and"
2333,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,veranda--coupled with the withdrawal of the light of his father's
2334,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,countenance.
2335,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2336,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"He took the sentence like the man he strove to be, drew himself up"
2337,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"with a quivering under-lip, saluted, and, once clear of the room ran,"
2338,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,to weep bitterly in his nursery--called by him 'my quarters.' Coppy
2339,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,came in the afternoon and attempted to console the culprit.
2340,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2341,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I'm under awwest,' said Wee Willie Winkie mournfully, 'and I didn't"
2342,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,ought to speak to you.'
2343,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2344,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Very early the next morning he climbed on to the roof of the
2345,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,house--that was not forbidden--and beheld Miss Allardyce going for a
2346,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,ride.
2347,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2348,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Where are you going?' cried Wee Willie Winkie.
2349,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2350,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Across the river,' she answered, and trotted forward."
2351,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2352,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Now the cantonment in which the 195th lay was bounded on the north by
2353,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"a river--dry in the winter. From his earliest years, Wee Willie"
2354,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Winkie had been forbidden to go across the river, and had noted that"
2355,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,even Coppy--the almost almighty Coppy--had never set foot beyond it.
2356,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Wee Willie Winkie had once been read to, out of a big blue book, the"
2357,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,history of the Princess and the Goblins--a most wonderful tale of a
2358,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,land where the Goblins were always warring with the children of men
2359,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,until they were defeated by one Curdie. Ever since that date it
2360,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,seemed to him that the bare black and purple hills across the river
2361,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"were inhabited by Goblins, and, in truth, every one had said that"
2362,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,there lived the Bad Men. Even in his own house the lower halves of
2363,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,the windows were covered with green paper on account of the Bad Men
2364,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"who might, if allowed clear view, fire into peaceful drawing-rooms"
2365,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"and comfortable bedrooms. Certainly, beyond the river, which was the"
2366,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"end of all the Earth, lived the Bad Men. And here was Major"
2367,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Allardyce's big girl, Coppy's property, preparing to venture into"
2368,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,their borders! What would Coppy say if anything happened to her? If
2369,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,the Goblins ran off with her as they did with Curdie's Princess? She
2370,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,must at all hazards be turned back.
2371,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2372,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,The house was still. Wee Willie Winkie reflected for a moment on the
2373,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,very terrible wrath of his father; and then--broke his arrest! It was
2374,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"a crime unspeakable. The low sun threw his shadow, very large and"
2375,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"very black, on the trim garden-paths, as he went down to the stables"
2376,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,and ordered his pony. It seemed to him in the hush of the dawn that
2377,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,all the big world had been bidden to stand still and look at Wee
2378,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Willie Winkie guilty of mutiny. The drowsy _sais_ gave him his mount,"
2379,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"and, since the one great sin made all others insignificant, Wee"
2380,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Willie Winkie said that he was going to ride over to Coppy Sahib, and"
2381,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"went out at a foot-pace, stepping on the soft mould of the"
2382,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,flower-borders.
2383,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2384,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,The devastating track of the pony's feet was the last misdeed that
2385,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"cut him off from all sympathy of Humanity. He turned into the road,"
2386,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"leaned forward, and rode as fast as the pony could put foot to the"
2387,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,ground in the direction of the river.
2388,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2389,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,But the liveliest of twelve-two ponies can do little against the
2390,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"long canter of a Waler. Miss Allardyce was far ahead, had passed"
2391,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"through the crops, beyond the Police-posts, when all the guards were"
2392,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"asleep, and her mount was scattering the pebbles of the river-bed as"
2393,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Wee Willie Winkie left the cantonment and British India behind him.
2394,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Bowed forward and still flogging, Wee Willie Winkie shot into Afghan"
2395,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"territory, and could just see Miss Allardyce a black speck,"
2396,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,flickering across the stony plain. The reason of her wandering was
2397,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"simple enough. Coppy, in a tone of too-hastily-assumed authority, had"
2398,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,told her overnight that she must not ride out by the river. And she
2399,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,had gone to prove her own spirit and teach Coppy a lesson.
2400,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2401,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Almost at the foot of the inhospitable hills, Wee Willie Winkie saw"
2402,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,the Waler blunder and come down heavily. Miss Allardyce struggled
2403,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"clear, but her ankle had been severely twisted, and she could not"
2404,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"stand. Having fully shown her spirit, she wept, and was surprised by"
2405,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the apparition of a white, wide-eyed child in khaki, on a nearly"
2406,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,spent pony.
2407,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2408,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Are you badly, badly hurted?' shouted Wee Willie Winkie, as soon as"
2409,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,he was within range. 'You didn't ought to be here.'
2410,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2411,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I don't know,' said Miss Allardyce ruefully, ignoring the reproof."
2412,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Good gracious, child, what are _you_ doing here?'"
2413,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2414,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'You said you was going acwoss ve wiver,' panted Wee Willie Winkie,"
2415,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,throwing himself off his pony. 'And nobody--not even Coppy--must go
2416,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"acwoss ve wiver, and I came after you ever so hard, but you wouldn't"
2417,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"stop, and now you've hurted yourself, and Coppy will be angwy wiv me,"
2418,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,and--I've bwoken my awwest! I've bwoken my awwest!'
2419,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2420,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,The future Colonel of the 195th sat down and sobbed. In spite of the
2421,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,pain in her ankle the girl was moved.
2422,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2423,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Have you ridden all the way from cantonments, little man? What for?'"
2424,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2425,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'You belonged to Coppy. Coppy told me so!' wailed Wee Willie Winkie
2426,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"disconsolately. 'I saw him kissing you, and he said he was fonder of"
2427,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,you van Bell or ve Butcha or me. And so I came. You must get up and
2428,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"come back. You didn't ought to be here. Vis is a bad place, and I've"
2429,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,bwoken my awwest.'
2430,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2431,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I can't move, Winkie,' said Miss Allardyce, with a groan. 'I've hurt"
2432,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,my foot. What shall I do?'
2433,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2434,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"She showed a readiness to weep anew, which steadied Wee Willie"
2435,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Winkie, who had been brought up to believe that tears were the depth"
2436,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"of unmanliness. Still, when one is as great a sinner as Wee Willie"
2437,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Winkie, even a man may be permitted to break down."
2438,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2439,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Winkie,' said Miss Allardyce, 'when you've rested a little, ride"
2440,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,back and tell them to send out something to carry me back in. It
2441,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,hurts fearfully.'
2442,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2443,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,The child sat still for a little time and Miss Allardyce closed her
2444,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,eyes; the pain was nearly making her faint. She was roused by Wee
2445,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Willie Winkie tying up the reins on his pony's neck and setting it
2446,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,free with a vicious cut of his whip that made it whicker. The little
2447,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,animal headed towards the cantonments.
2448,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2449,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Oh, Winkie, what are you doing?'"
2450,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2451,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Hush!' said Wee Willie Winkie. 'Vere's a man coming--one of've Bad
2452,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Men. I must stay wiv you. My faver says a man must _always_ look
2453,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"after a girl. Jack will go home, and ven vey'll come and look for us."
2454,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Vat's why I let him go.'
2455,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2456,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Not one man but two or three had appeared from behind the rocks of
2457,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the hills, and the heart of Wee Willie Winkie sank within him, for"
2458,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,just in this manner were the Goblins wont to steal out and vex
2459,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Curdie's soul. Thus had they played in Curdie's garden--he had seen
2460,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,the picture--and thus had they frightened the Princess's nurse. He
2461,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"heard them talking to each other, and recognised with joy the bastard"
2462,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Pushto that he had picked up from one of his father's grooms lately
2463,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,dismissed. People who spoke that tongue could not be the Bad Men.
2464,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,They were only natives after all.
2465,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2466,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,They came up to the boulders on which Miss Allardyce's horse had
2467,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,blundered.
2468,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2469,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Then rose from the rock Wee Willie Winkie, child of the Dominant"
2470,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Race, aged six and three-quarters, and said briefly and emphatically"
2471,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'_Jao_!' The pony had crossed the river-bed.
2472,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2473,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"The men laughed, and laughter from natives was the one thing Wee"
2474,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Willie Winkie could not tolerate. He asked them what they wanted and
2475,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,why they did not depart. Other men with most evil faces and
2476,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"crooked-stocked guns crept out of the shadows of the hills, till,"
2477,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"soon, Wee Willie Winkie was face to face with an audience some twenty"
2478,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,strong. Miss Allardyce screamed.
2479,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2480,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Who are you?' said one of the men.
2481,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2482,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I am the Colonel Sahib's son, and my order is that you go at once."
2483,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,You black men are frightening the Miss Sahib.
2484,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2485,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,One of you must run into cantonments and take the news that the Miss
2486,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Sahib has hurt herself, and that the Colonel's son is here with her.'"
2487,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2488,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Put our feet into the trap?' was the laughing reply.
2489,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2490,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'Hear this boy's speech!'
2491,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2492,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Say that I sent you--I, the Colonel's son. They will give you"
2493,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,money.'
2494,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2495,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'What is the use of this talk? Take up the child and the girl, and we"
2496,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,can at least ask for the ransom. Ours are the villages on the
2497,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"heights,' said a voice in the background."
2498,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2499,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,These _were_ the Bad Men--worse than Goblins--and it needed all Wee
2500,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Willie Winkie's training to prevent him from bursting into tears. But
2501,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"he felt that to cry before a native, excepting only his mother's"
2502,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"_ayah_, would be an infamy greater than any mutiny. Moreover, he, as"
2503,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"future Colonel of the 195th, had that grim regiment at his back."
2504,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2505,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Are you going to carry us away?' said Wee Willie Winkie, very"
2506,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,blanched and uncomfortable.
2507,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2508,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'Yes, my little _Sahib Bahadur_,' said the tallest of the men, 'and"
2509,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,eat you afterwards.'
2510,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2511,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'That is child's talk,' said Wee Willie Winkie. 'Men do not eat men.'"
2512,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2513,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"A yell of laughter interrupted him, but he went on firmly--'And if"
2514,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"you do carry us away, I tell you that all my regiment will come up in"
2515,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,a day and kill you all without leaving one. Who will take my message
2516,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,to the Colonel Sahib?'
2517,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2518,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Speech in any vernacular--and Wee Willie Winkie had a colloquial
2519,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,acquaintance with three--was easy to the boy who could not yet manage
2520,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,his 'r's' and 'th's' aright.
2521,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2522,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Another man joined the conference, crying: 'O foolish men! What this"
2523,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,babe says is true. He is the heart's heart of those white troops. For
2524,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the sake of peace let them go both, for if he be taken, the regiment"
2525,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,will break loose and gut the valley. _Our_ villages are in the
2526,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"valley, and we shall not escape. That regiment are devils. They broke"
2527,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Khoda Yar's breastbone with kicks when he tried to take the rifles;
2528,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,and if we touch this child they will fire and rape and plunder for a
2529,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"month, till nothing remains. Better to send a man back to take the"
2530,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"message and get a reward. I say that this child is their God, and"
2531,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"that they will spare none of us, nor our women, if we harm him.'"
2532,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2533,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"It was Din Mahommed, the dismissed groom of the Colonel, who made the"
2534,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"diversion, and an angry and heated discussion followed. Wee Willie"
2535,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Winkie, standing over Miss Allardyce, waited the upshot. Surely his"
2536,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'wegiment,' his own 'wegiment,' would not desert him if they knew of"
2537,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,his extremity.
2538,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2539,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,*       *       *       *       *
2540,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2541,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"The riderless pony brought the news to the 195th, though there had"
2542,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,been consternation in the Colonel's household for an hour before. The
2543,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,little beast came in through the parade-ground in front of the main
2544,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"barracks, where the men were settling down to play Spoil-five till"
2545,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the afternoon. Devlin, the Colour-Sergeant of E Company, glanced at"
2546,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the empty saddle and tumbled through the barrack-rooms, kicking; up"
2547,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"each Room Corporal as he passed. 'Up, ye beggars! There's something"
2548,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"happened to the Colonel's son,' he shouted."
2549,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2550,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'He couldn't fall off! S'elp me, 'e _couldn't_ fall off,' blubbered"
2551,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,a drummer-boy. 'Go an' hunt acrost the river. He's over there if he's
2552,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"anywhere, an' maybe those Pathans have got 'im. For the love o' Gawd"
2553,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,don't look for 'im in the nullahs! Let's go over the river.'
2554,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2555,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'There's sense in Mott yet,' said Devlin. 'E Company, double out to"
2556,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,the river--sharp!'
2557,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2558,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"So E Company, in its shirt-sleeves mainly, doubled for the dear life,"
2559,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"and in the rear toiled the perspiring Sergeant, adjuring it to double"
2560,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,yet faster. The cantonment was alive with the men of the 195th
2561,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"hunting for Wee Willie Winkie, and the Colonel finally overtook E"
2562,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Company, far too exhausted to swear, struggling in the pebbles of the"
2563,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,river-bed.
2564,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2565,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Up the hill under which Wee Willie Winkie's Bad Men were discussing
2566,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"the wisdom of carrying off the child and the girl, a look-out fired"
2567,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,two shots.
2568,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2569,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,'What have I said?' shouted Din Mahommed. 'There is the warning! The
2570,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,_pulton_ are out already and are coming across the plain! Get away!
2571,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Let us not be seen with the boy!'
2572,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2573,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"The men waited for an instant, and then, as another shot was fired,"
2574,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"withdrew into the hills, silently as they had appeared."
2575,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2576,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'The wegiment is coming,' said Wee Willie Winkie confidently to Miss"
2577,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"Allardyce, 'and it's all wight. Don't cwy!'"
2578,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2579,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"He needed the advice himself, for ten minutes later, when his father"
2580,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"came up, he was weeping bitterly with his head in Miss Allardyce's"
2581,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,lap.
2582,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2583,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,And the men of the 195th carried him home with shouts and rejoicings;
2584,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"and Coppy, who had ridden a horse into a lather, met him, and, to his"
2585,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"intense disgust, kissed him openly in the presence of the men."
2586,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2587,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,But there was balm for his dignity. His father assured him that not
2588,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"only would the breaking of arrest be condoned, but that the"
2589,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,good-conduct badge would be restored as soon as his mother could sew
2590,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,it on his blouse-sleeve. Miss Allardyce had told the Colonel a story
2591,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,that made him proud of his son.
2592,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2593,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'She belonged to you, Coppy,' said Wee Willie Winkie, indicating Miss"
2594,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Allardyce with a grimy forefinger. 'I _knew_ she didn't ought to go
2595,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"acwoss ve wiver, and I knew ve wegiment would come to me if I sent"
2596,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,Jack home.'
2597,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2598,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'You're a hero, Winkie,' said Coppy--'a _pukka_ hero!'"
2599,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2600,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,"'I don't know what vat means,' said Wee Willie Winkie, 'but you"
2601,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,mustn't call me Winkie any no more. I'm 'Percival Will'am Will'ams.'
2602,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,
2603,AN  OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN,And in this manner did Wee Willie Winkie enter into his manhood.

2608,A MATTER OF FACT.,A MATTER OF FACT.
2609,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2610,A MATTER OF FACT.,"And if ye doubt the tale I tell,"
2611,A MATTER OF FACT.,Steer through the South Pacific swell;
2612,A MATTER OF FACT.,Go where the branching coral hives
2613,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Unending strife of endless lives,"
2614,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Where, leagued about the 'wildered boat,"
2615,A MATTER OF FACT.,The rainbow jellies fill and float;
2616,A MATTER OF FACT.,"And, lilting where the laver lingers,"
2617,A MATTER OF FACT.,The starfish trips on all her fingers;
2618,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Where, 'neath his myriad spines ashock,"
2619,A MATTER OF FACT.,The sea-egg ripples down the rock;

2622,A MATTER OF FACT.,Moored o'er the darker deeps that hide

2624,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Who, drowsing, nose the long-lost ships"
2625,A MATTER OF FACT.,Let down through darkness to their lips.
2626,A MATTER OF FACT.,_The Palms_.

2628,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Once a priest, always a priest; once a mason, always a mason; but"
2629,A MATTER OF FACT.,"once a journalist, always and for ever a journalist."
2630,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2631,A MATTER OF FACT.,"There were three of us, all newspaper men, the only passengers on a"
2632,A MATTER OF FACT.,little tramp steamer that ran where her owners told her to go. She
2633,A MATTER OF FACT.,"had once been in the Bilbao iron ore business, had been lent to the"
2634,A MATTER OF FACT.,Spanish Government for service at Manilla; and was ending her days in
2635,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the Cape Town coolie-trade, with occasional trips to Madagascar and"
2636,A MATTER OF FACT.,"even as far as England. We found her going to Southampton in ballast,"
2637,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and shipped in her because the fares were nominal. There was Keller,"
2638,A MATTER OF FACT.,"of an American paper, on his way back to the States from palace"
2639,A MATTER OF FACT.,"executions in Madagascar; there was a burly half-Dutchman, called"
2640,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Zuyland, who owned and edited a paper up country near Johannesburg;"
2641,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and there was myself, who had solemnly put away all journalism,"
2642,A MATTER OF FACT.,vowing to forget that I had ever known the difference between an
2643,A MATTER OF FACT.,imprint and a stereo advertisement.
2644,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2645,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Ten minutes after Keller spoke to me, as the _Rathmines_ cleared Cape"
2646,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Town, I had forgotten the aloofness I desired to feign, and was in"
2647,A MATTER OF FACT.,heated discussion on the immorality of expanding telegrams beyond a
2648,A MATTER OF FACT.,"certain fixed point. Then Zuyland came out of his cabin, and we were"
2649,A MATTER OF FACT.,"all at home instantly, because we were men of the same profession"
2650,A MATTER OF FACT.,"needing no introduction. We annexed the boat formally, broke open the"
2651,A MATTER OF FACT.,passengers' bath-room door--on the Manilla lines the Dons do not
2652,A MATTER OF FACT.,wash--cleaned out the orange peel and cigar-ends at the bottom of the
2653,A MATTER OF FACT.,"bath, hired a Lascar to shave us throughout the voyage, and then"
2654,A MATTER OF FACT.,asked each other's names.
2655,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2656,A MATTER OF FACT.,Three ordinary men would have quarrelled through sheer boredom before
2657,A MATTER OF FACT.,"they reached Southampton. We, by virtue of our craft, were anything"
2658,A MATTER OF FACT.,"but ordinary men. A large percentage of the tales of the world, the"
2659,A MATTER OF FACT.,"thirty-nine that cannot be told to ladies and the one that can, are"
2660,A MATTER OF FACT.,"common property coming of a common stock. We told them all, as a"
2661,A MATTER OF FACT.,"matter of form, with all their local and specific variants which are"
2662,A MATTER OF FACT.,"surprising. Then came, in the intervals of steady card-play, more"
2663,A MATTER OF FACT.,personal histories of adventure and things seen and suffered: panics
2664,A MATTER OF FACT.,"among white folk, when the blind terror ran from man to man on the"
2665,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Brooklyn Bridge, and the people crushed each other to death they knew"
2666,A MATTER OF FACT.,"not why; fires, and faces that opened and shut their mouths horribly"
2667,A MATTER OF FACT.,"at red-hot window frames; wrecks in frost and snow, reported from the"
2668,A MATTER OF FACT.,sleet-sheathed rescue-tug at the risk of frost-bite; long rides after
2669,A MATTER OF FACT.,diamond thieves; skirmishes on the veldt and in municipal committees
2670,A MATTER OF FACT.,with the Boers; glimpses of lazy tangled Cape politics and the
2671,A MATTER OF FACT.,"mule-rule in the Transvaal; card-tales, horse-tales, woman-tales, by"
2672,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the score and the half hundred; till the first mate, who had seen"
2673,A MATTER OF FACT.,"more than us all put together, but lacked words to clothe his tales"
2674,A MATTER OF FACT.,"with, sat open-mouthed far into the dawn."
2675,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2676,A MATTER OF FACT.,When the tales were done we picked up cards till a curious hand or a
2677,A MATTER OF FACT.,"chance remark made one or other of us say, 'That reminds me of a man"
2678,A MATTER OF FACT.,who--or a business which--' and the anecdotes would continue while
2679,A MATTER OF FACT.,the _Rathmines_ kicked her way northward through the warm water.
2680,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2681,A MATTER OF FACT.,In the morning of one specially warm night we three were sitting
2682,A MATTER OF FACT.,"immediately in front of the wheel-house, where an old Swedish"
2683,A MATTER OF FACT.,"boatswain whom we called 'Frithiof the Dane' was at the wheel,"
2684,A MATTER OF FACT.,pretending that he could not hear our stories. Once or twice Frithiof
2685,A MATTER OF FACT.,"spun the spokes curiously, and Keller lifted his head from a long"
2686,A MATTER OF FACT.,"chair to ask, 'What is it? Can't you get any steerage-way on her?'"
2687,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2688,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'There is a feel in the water,' said Frithiof, 'that I cannot"
2689,A MATTER OF FACT.,understand. I think that we run downhills or somethings. She steers
2690,A MATTER OF FACT.,bad this morning.'
2691,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2692,A MATTER OF FACT.,Nobody seems to know the laws that govern the pulse of the big
2693,A MATTER OF FACT.,waters. Sometimes even a landsman can tell that the solid ocean is
2694,A MATTER OF FACT.,"atilt, and that the ship is working herself up a long unseen slope;"
2695,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and sometimes the captain says, when neither full steam nor fair"
2696,A MATTER OF FACT.,"wind justifies the length of a day's run, that the ship is sagging"
2697,A MATTER OF FACT.,downhill; but how these ups and downs come about has not yet been
2698,A MATTER OF FACT.,settled authoritatively.
2699,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2700,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'No, it is a following sea,' said Frithiof; 'and with a following"
2701,A MATTER OF FACT.,sea you shall not get good steerage-way.'
2702,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2703,A MATTER OF FACT.,"The sea was as smooth as a duck-pond, except for a regular oily"
2704,A MATTER OF FACT.,swell. As I looked over the side to see where it might be following
2705,A MATTER OF FACT.,"us from, the sun rose in a perfectly clear sky and struck the water"
2706,A MATTER OF FACT.,with its light so sharply that it seemed as though the sea should
2707,A MATTER OF FACT.,clang like a burnished gong. The wake of the screw and the little
2708,A MATTER OF FACT.,white streak cut by the log-line hanging over the stern were the only
2709,A MATTER OF FACT.,marks on the water as far as eye could reach.
2710,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2711,A MATTER OF FACT.,Keller rolled out of his chair and went aft to get a pineapple from
2712,A MATTER OF FACT.,the ripening stock that was hung inside the after awning.
2713,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2714,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Frithiof, the log-line has got tired of swimming. It's coming"
2715,A MATTER OF FACT.,"home,' he drawled."
2716,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2717,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'What?' said Frithiof, his voice jumping several octaves."
2718,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2719,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Coming home,' Keller repeated, leaning over the stern. I ran to his"
2720,A MATTER OF FACT.,"side and saw the log-line, which till then had been drawn tense over"
2721,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the stern railing, slacken, loop, and come up off the port quarter."
2722,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Frithiof called up the speaking tube to the bridge, and the bridge"
2723,A MATTER OF FACT.,"answered, 'Yes, nine knots.' Then Frithiof spoke again, and the"
2724,A MATTER OF FACT.,"answer was, 'What do you want of the skipper?' and Frithiof bellowed,"
2725,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Call him up.'
2726,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2727,A MATTER OF FACT.,"By this time Zuyland, Keller, and myself had caught something of"
2728,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Frithiof's excitement, for any emotion on shipboard is most"
2729,A MATTER OF FACT.,"contagious. The captain ran out of his cabin, spoke to Frithiof,"
2730,A MATTER OF FACT.,"looked at the log-line, jumped on the bridge, and in a minute we"
2731,A MATTER OF FACT.,felt the steamer swing round as Frithiof turned her.
2732,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2733,A MATTER OF FACT.,''Going back to Cape Town?' said Keller.
2734,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2735,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Frithiof did not answer, but tore away at the wheel. Then he beckoned"
2736,A MATTER OF FACT.,"us three to help, and we held the wheel down till the _Rathmines_"
2737,A MATTER OF FACT.,"answered it, and we found ourselves looking into the white of our own"
2738,A MATTER OF FACT.,"wake, with the still oily sea tearing past our bows, though we were"
2739,A MATTER OF FACT.,not going more than half steam ahead.
2740,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2741,A MATTER OF FACT.,The captain stretched out his arm from the bridge and shouted. A
2742,A MATTER OF FACT.,"minute later I would have given a great deal to have shouted too, for"
2743,A MATTER OF FACT.,"one-half of the sea seemed to shoulder itself above the other half,"
2744,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and came on in the shape of a hill. There was neither crest, comb,"
2745,A MATTER OF FACT.,nor curl-over to it; nothing but black water with little waves
2746,A MATTER OF FACT.,chasing each other about the flanks. I saw it stream past and on a
2747,A MATTER OF FACT.,level with the _Rathmines_' bow-plates before the steamer hove up
2748,A MATTER OF FACT.,"her bulk to rise, and I argued that this would be the last of all"
2749,A MATTER OF FACT.,"earthly voyages for me. Then we lifted for ever and ever and ever,"
2750,A MATTER OF FACT.,"till I heard Keller saying in my ear, 'The bowels of the deep, good"
2751,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Lord!' and the _Rathmines_ stood poised, her screw-racing and"
2752,A MATTER OF FACT.,drumming on the slope of a hollow that stretched downwards for a good
2753,A MATTER OF FACT.,half-mile.
2754,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2755,A MATTER OF FACT.,"We went down that hollow, nose under for the most part, and the air"
2756,A MATTER OF FACT.,"smelt wet and muddy, like that of an emptied aquarium. There was a"
2757,A MATTER OF FACT.,second hill to climb; I saw that much: but the water came aboard and
2758,A MATTER OF FACT.,"earned me aft till it jammed me against the wheel-house door, and"
2759,A MATTER OF FACT.,before I could catch breath or clear my eyes again we were rolling to
2760,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and fro in torn water, with the scuppers pouring like eaves in a"
2761,A MATTER OF FACT.,thunderstorm.
2762,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2763,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'There were three waves,' said Keller; 'and the stokehold's flooded.'"
2764,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2765,A MATTER OF FACT.,"The firemen were on deck waiting, apparently, to be drowned."
2766,A MATTER OF FACT.,"The engineer came and dragged them below, and the crew, gasping,"
2767,A MATTER OF FACT.,began to work the clumsy Board of Trade pump. That showed nothing
2768,A MATTER OF FACT.,"serious, and when I understood that the _Rathmines_ was really on the"
2769,A MATTER OF FACT.,"water, and not beneath it, I asked what had happened."
2770,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2771,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'The captain says it was a blow-up under the sea--a volcano,' said"
2772,A MATTER OF FACT.,Keller.
2773,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2774,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'It hasn't warmed anything,' I said. I was feeling bitterly cold, and"
2775,A MATTER OF FACT.,cold was almost unknown in those waters. I went below to change my
2776,A MATTER OF FACT.,"clothes, and when I came up everything was wiped out in clinging"
2777,A MATTER OF FACT.,white fog.
2778,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2779,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Are there going to be any more surprises?' said Keller to the
2780,A MATTER OF FACT.,captain.
2781,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2782,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'I don't know. Be thankful you are alive, gentlemen. That's a tidal"
2783,A MATTER OF FACT.,wave thrown up by a volcano. Probably the bottom of the sea has been
2784,A MATTER OF FACT.,lifted a few feet somewhere or other. I can't quite understand this
2785,A MATTER OF FACT.,"cold spell. Our sea-thermometer says the surface water is 44°, and"
2786,A MATTER OF FACT.,it should be 68° at least.'
2787,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2788,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'It's abominable,' said Keller, shivering. 'But hadn't you better"
2789,A MATTER OF FACT.,attend to the fog-horn? It seems to me that I heard something.'
2790,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2791,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Heard! Good heavens!' said the captain from the bridge, 'I should"
2792,A MATTER OF FACT.,"think you did.' He pulled the string of our fog-horn, which was a"
2793,A MATTER OF FACT.,"weak one. It sputtered and choked, because the stoke-hold was full of"
2794,A MATTER OF FACT.,"water and the fires were half drowned, and at last gave out a moan."
2795,A MATTER OF FACT.,It was answered from the fog by one of the most appalling steam
2796,A MATTER OF FACT.,"sirens I have ever heard. Keller turned as white as I did, for the"
2797,A MATTER OF FACT.,"fog, the cold fog, was upon us, and any man may be forgiven for"
2798,A MATTER OF FACT.,fearing a death he cannot see.
2799,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2800,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Give her steam there!' said the captain to the engine-room. 'Steam
2801,A MATTER OF FACT.,"for the whistle, if we have to go dead slow.'"
2802,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2803,A MATTER OF FACT.,"We bellowed again, and the damp dripped off the awnings on to the"
2804,A MATTER OF FACT.,"deck as we listened for the reply. It seemed to be astern this time,"
2805,A MATTER OF FACT.,but much nearer than before.
2806,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2807,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'The _Pembroke Castle_ on us!' said Keller; and then, viciously,"
2808,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Well, thank God, we shall sink her too.'"
2809,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2810,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'It's a side-wheel steamer,' I whispered.  'Can't you hear the"
2811,A MATTER OF FACT.,paddles?'
2812,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2813,A MATTER OF FACT.,"This time we whistled and roared till the steam gave out, and the"
2814,A MATTER OF FACT.,answer nearly deafened us. There was a sound of frantic threshing in
2815,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the water, apparently about fifty yards away, and something shot past"
2816,A MATTER OF FACT.,in the whiteness that looked as though it were gray and red.
2817,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2818,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'The _Pembroke Castle_ bottom up,' said Keller, who, being a"
2819,A MATTER OF FACT.,"journalist, always sought for explanations. 'That's the colours of a"
2820,A MATTER OF FACT.,Castle liner. We're in for a big thing.'
2821,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2822,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'The sea is bewitched,' said Frithiof from the wheel-house. 'There"
2823,A MATTER OF FACT.,are _two_ steamers!'
2824,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2825,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Another siren sounded on our bow, and the little steamer rolled in"
2826,A MATTER OF FACT.,the wash of something that had passed unseen.
2827,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2828,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'We're evidently in the middle of a fleet,' said Keller quietly. 'If"
2829,A MATTER OF FACT.,"one doesn't run us down, the other will. Phew! What in creation is"
2830,A MATTER OF FACT.,that?'
2831,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2832,A MATTER OF FACT.,"I sniffed, for there was a poisonous rank smell in the cold air--a"
2833,A MATTER OF FACT.,smell that I had smelt before.
2834,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2835,A MATTER OF FACT.,'If I was on land I should say that it was an alligator. It smells
2836,A MATTER OF FACT.,"like musk,' I answered."
2837,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2838,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Not ten thousand alligators could make that smell' said Zuyland; 'I
2839,A MATTER OF FACT.,have smelt them.'
2840,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2841,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Bewitched! Bewitched!' said Frithiof. 'The sea she is turned upside
2842,A MATTER OF FACT.,"down, and we are walking along the bottom.'"
2843,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2844,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Again the _Rathmines_ rolled in the wash of some unseen ship, and a"
2845,A MATTER OF FACT.,"silver-gray wave broke over the bow, leaving on the deck a sheet of"
2846,A MATTER OF FACT.,sediment--the gray broth that has its place in the fathomless deeps
2847,A MATTER OF FACT.,"of the sea. A sprinkling of the wave fell on my face, and it was so"
2848,A MATTER OF FACT.,cold that it stung as boiling water stings. The dead and most
2849,A MATTER OF FACT.,untouched deep water of the sea had been heaved to the top by the
2850,A MATTER OF FACT.,submarine volcano--the chill still water that kills all life and
2851,A MATTER OF FACT.,smells of desolation and emptiness. We did not need either the
2852,A MATTER OF FACT.,blinding fog or that indescribable smell of musk to make us
2853,A MATTER OF FACT.,unhappy--we were shivering with cold and wretchedness where we stood.
2854,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2855,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'The hot air on the cold water makes this fog,' said the captain; 'it"
2856,A MATTER OF FACT.,ought to clear in a little time.'
2857,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2858,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Whistle, oh! whistle, and let's get out of it,' said Keller."
2859,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2860,A MATTER OF FACT.,"The captain whistled again, and far and far astern the invisible twin"
2861,A MATTER OF FACT.,"steam-sirens answered us. Their blasting shriek grew louder, till at"
2862,A MATTER OF FACT.,"last it seemed to tear out of the fog just above our quarter, and I"
2863,A MATTER OF FACT.,cowered while the _Rathmines_ plunged bows under on a double swell
2864,A MATTER OF FACT.,that crossed.
2865,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2866,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'No more,' said Frithiof, 'it is not good any more. Let us get away,"
2867,A MATTER OF FACT.,in the name of God.'
2868,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2869,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Now if a torpedo-boat with a _City of Paris_ siren went mad and
2870,A MATTER OF FACT.,"broke her moorings and hired a friend to help her, it's just"
2871,A MATTER OF FACT.,conceivable that we might be carried as we are now. Otherwise this
2872,A MATTER OF FACT.,thing is----'
2873,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2874,A MATTER OF FACT.,"The last words died on Keller's lips, his eyes began to start from"
2875,A MATTER OF FACT.,"his head, and his jaw fell. Some six or seven feet above the port"
2876,A MATTER OF FACT.,"bulwarks, framed in fog, and as utterly unsupported as the full moon,"
2877,A MATTER OF FACT.,"hung a Face. It was not human, and it certainly was not animal, for"
2878,A MATTER OF FACT.,"it did not belong to this earth as known to man. The mouth was open,"
2879,A MATTER OF FACT.,revealing a ridiculously tiny tongue--as absurd as the tongue of an
2880,A MATTER OF FACT.,elephant; there were tense wrinkles of white skin at the angles of
2881,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the drawn lips, white feelers like those of a barbel sprung from the"
2882,A MATTER OF FACT.,"lower jaw, and there was no sign of teeth within the mouth. But the"
2883,A MATTER OF FACT.,"horror of the face lay in the eyes, for those were sightless--white,"
2884,A MATTER OF FACT.,"in sockets as white as scraped bone, and blind. Yet for all this the"
2885,A MATTER OF FACT.,"face, wrinkled as the mask of a lion is drawn in Assyrian sculpture,"
2886,A MATTER OF FACT.,was alive with rage and terror. One long white feeler touched our
2887,A MATTER OF FACT.,bulwarks. Then the face disappeared with the swiftness of a blindworm
2888,A MATTER OF FACT.,"popping into its burrow, and the next thing that I remember is my own"
2889,A MATTER OF FACT.,"voice in my own ears, saying gravely to the mainmast, 'But the"
2890,A MATTER OF FACT.,"air-bladder ought to have been forced out of its mouth, you know.'"
2891,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2892,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Keller came up to me, ashy white. He put his hand into his pocket,"
2893,A MATTER OF FACT.,"took a cigar, bit it, dropped it, thrust his shaking thumb into his"
2894,A MATTER OF FACT.,"mouth and mumbled, 'The giant gooseberry and the raining frogs! Gimme"
2895,A MATTER OF FACT.,"a light--gimme a light! Say, gimme a light. A little bead of blood"
2896,A MATTER OF FACT.,dropped from his thumb-joint.
2897,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2898,A MATTER OF FACT.,"I respected the motive, though the manifestation was absurd. 'Stop,"
2899,A MATTER OF FACT.,"you'll bite your thumb off,' I said, and Keller laughed brokenly as"
2900,A MATTER OF FACT.,"he picked up his cigar. Only Zuyland, leaning over the port bulwarks,"
2901,A MATTER OF FACT.,seemed self-possessed. He declared later that he was very sick.
2902,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2903,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'We've seen it,' he said, turning round. 'That is it.'"
2904,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2905,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'What?' said Keller, chewing the unlighted cigar."
2906,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2907,A MATTER OF FACT.,"As he spoke the fog was blown into shreds, and we saw the sea, gray"
2908,A MATTER OF FACT.,"with mud, rolling on every side of us and empty of all life. Then in"
2909,A MATTER OF FACT.,one spot it bubbled and became like the pot of ointment that the
2910,A MATTER OF FACT.,Bible speaks of. From that wide-ringed trouble the Thing came up--a
2911,A MATTER OF FACT.,gray and red Thing with a neck--a Thing that bellowed and writhed in
2912,A MATTER OF FACT.,pain. Frithiof drew in his breath and held it till the red letters of
2913,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the ship's name, woven across his jersey, straggled and opened out as"
2914,A MATTER OF FACT.,though they had been type badly set. Then he said with a little cluck
2915,A MATTER OF FACT.,"in his throat, 'Ah me! It is blind. _Hur illa_! That thing is blind,'"
2916,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and a murmur of pity went through us all, for we could see that the"
2917,A MATTER OF FACT.,thing on the water was blind and in pain. Something had gashed and
2918,A MATTER OF FACT.,cut the great sides cruelly and the blood was spurting out. The gray
2919,A MATTER OF FACT.,"ooze of the undermost sea lay in the monstrous wrinkles of the back,"
2920,A MATTER OF FACT.,and poured away in sluices. The blind white head flung back and
2921,A MATTER OF FACT.,"battered the wounds, and the body in its torment rose clear of the"
2922,A MATTER OF FACT.,red and gray waves till we saw a pair of quivering shoulders streaked
2923,A MATTER OF FACT.,"with weed and rough with shells, but as white in the clear spaces as"
2924,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the hairless, maneless, blind, toothless head. Afterwards, came a dot"
2925,A MATTER OF FACT.,"on the horizon and the sound of a shrill scream, and it was as though"
2926,A MATTER OF FACT.,"a shuttle shot all across the sea in one breath, and a second head"
2927,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and neck tore through the levels, driving a whispering wall of water"
2928,A MATTER OF FACT.,to right and left. The two Things met--the one untouched and the
2929,A MATTER OF FACT.,"other in its death-throe--male and female, we said, the female"
2930,A MATTER OF FACT.,"coming to the male. She circled round him bellowing, and laid her"
2931,A MATTER OF FACT.,"neck across the curve of his great turtle-back, and he disappeared"
2932,A MATTER OF FACT.,"under water for an instant, but flung up again, grunting in agony"
2933,A MATTER OF FACT.,while the blood ran. Once the entire head and neck shot clear of the
2934,A MATTER OF FACT.,"water and stiffened, and  I  heard  Keller saying, as though he was"
2935,A MATTER OF FACT.,"watching a street accident, 'Give him air. For God's sake, give him"
2936,A MATTER OF FACT.,"air.' Then the death-struggle began, with crampings and twistings and"
2937,A MATTER OF FACT.,"jerkings of the white bulk to and fro, till our little steamer rolled"
2938,A MATTER OF FACT.,"again, and each gray wave coated her plates with the gray slime. The"
2939,A MATTER OF FACT.,"sun was clear, there  was  no  wind, and  we  watched, the whole"
2940,A MATTER OF FACT.,"crew, stokers and all, in wonder and pity, but chiefly pity. The"
2941,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Thing was so helpless, and, save for his mate, so alone. No human eye"
2942,A MATTER OF FACT.,should have beheld him; it was monstrous and indecent to exhibit him
2943,A MATTER OF FACT.,there in trade waters between atlas degrees of latitude. He had been
2944,A MATTER OF FACT.,"spewed up, mangled and dying, from his rest on the sea-floor, where"
2945,A MATTER OF FACT.,"he might have lived till the Judgment Day, and we saw the tides of"
2946,A MATTER OF FACT.,his life go from him as an angry tide goes out across rocks in the
2947,A MATTER OF FACT.,teeth of a landward gale. His mate lay rocking on the water a little
2948,A MATTER OF FACT.,"distance off, bellowing continually, and the smell of musk came dawn"
2949,A MATTER OF FACT.,upon the ship making us cough.
2950,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2951,A MATTER OF FACT.,At last the battle for life ended in a batter of coloured seas. We
2952,A MATTER OF FACT.,"saw the writhing neck fall like a flail, the carcase turn sideways,"
2953,A MATTER OF FACT.,showing the glint of a white belly and the inset of a gigantic hind
2954,A MATTER OF FACT.,"leg or flipper. Then all sank, and sea boiled over it, while the"
2955,A MATTER OF FACT.,"mate swam round and round, darting her head in every direction."
2956,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Though we might have feared that she would attack the steamer, no"
2957,A MATTER OF FACT.,power on earth could have drawn any one of us from our places that
2958,A MATTER OF FACT.,"hour. We watched, holding our breaths. The mate paused in her search;"
2959,A MATTER OF FACT.,we could hear the wash beating along her sides; reared her neck as
2960,A MATTER OF FACT.,"high as she could reach, blind and lonely in all that loneliness of"
2961,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the sea, and sent one desperate bellow booming across the swells as"
2962,A MATTER OF FACT.,an oyster-shell skips across a pond. Then she made off to the
2963,A MATTER OF FACT.,"westward, the sun shining on the white head and the wake behind it,"
2964,A MATTER OF FACT.,till nothing was left to see but a little pin point of silver on the
2965,A MATTER OF FACT.,"horizon. We stood on our course again; and the _Rathmines_, coated"
2966,A MATTER OF FACT.,"with the sea-sediment from bow to stern, looked like a ship made gray"
2967,A MATTER OF FACT.,with terror.
2968,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2969,A MATTER OF FACT.,*       *       *       *       *
2970,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2971,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'We must pool our notes,' was the first coherent remark from Keller."
2972,A MATTER OF FACT.,'We're three trained journalists--we hold absolutely the biggest
2973,A MATTER OF FACT.,scoop on record. Start fair.'
2974,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2975,A MATTER OF FACT.,I objected to this. Nothing is gained by collaboration in journalism
2976,A MATTER OF FACT.,"when all deal with the same facts, so we went to work each according"
2977,A MATTER OF FACT.,"to his own lights. Keller triple-headed his account, talked about our"
2978,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'gallant captain,' and wound up with an allusion to American"
2979,A MATTER OF FACT.,"enterprise in that it was a citizen of Dayton, Ohio, that had seen"
2980,A MATTER OF FACT.,the sea-serpent. This sort of thing would have discredited the
2981,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Creation, much more a mere sea tale, but as a specimen of the"
2982,A MATTER OF FACT.,picture-writing of a half-civilised people it was very interesting.
2983,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Zuyland took a heavy column and a half, giving approximate lengths"
2984,A MATTER OF FACT.,"and breadths, and the whole list of the crew whom he had sworn on"
2985,A MATTER OF FACT.,oath to testify to his facts. There was nothing fantastic or
2986,A MATTER OF FACT.,flamboyant in Zuyland. I wrote three-quarters of a leaded bourgeois
2987,A MATTER OF FACT.,"column, roughly speaking, and refrained from putting any journalese"
2988,A MATTER OF FACT.,into it for reasons that had begun to appear to me.
2989,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2990,A MATTER OF FACT.,Keller was insolent with joy. He was going to cable from Southampton
2991,A MATTER OF FACT.,"to the New York _World_, mail his account to America on the same day,"
2992,A MATTER OF FACT.,"paralyse London with his three columns of loosely knitted headlines,"
2993,A MATTER OF FACT.,and generally efface the earth. 'You'll see how I work a big scoop
2994,A MATTER OF FACT.,"when I get it,' he said."
2995,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2996,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Is this your first visit to England?' I asked.
2997,A MATTER OF FACT.,
2998,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Yes,' said he. 'You don't seem to appreciate the beauty of our"
2999,A MATTER OF FACT.,scoop. It's pyramidal--the death of the sea-serpent! Good heavens
3000,A MATTER OF FACT.,"alive, man, it's the biggest thing ever vouchsafed to a paper!'"
3001,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3002,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Curious to think that it will never appear in any paper, isn't it?"
3003,A MATTER OF FACT.,'I said.
3004,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3005,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Zuyland was near me, and he nodded quickly."
3006,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3007,A MATTER OF FACT.,'What do you mean?' said Keller. 'If you're enough of a Britisher to
3008,A MATTER OF FACT.,"throw this thing away, I shan't. I thought you were a newspaper-man.'"
3009,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3010,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'I am. That's why I know. Don't be an ass, Keller. Remember, I'm"
3011,A MATTER OF FACT.,"seven hundred years your senior, and what your grandchildren may"
3012,A MATTER OF FACT.,"learn five hundred years hence, I learned from my grandfathers about"
3013,A MATTER OF FACT.,"five hundred years ago. You won't do it, because you can't.'"
3014,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3015,A MATTER OF FACT.,"This conversation was held in open sea, where everything seems"
3016,A MATTER OF FACT.,"possible, some hundred miles from Southampton. We passed the Needles"
3017,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Light at dawn, and the lifting day showed the stucco villas on the"
3018,A MATTER OF FACT.,"green and the awful orderliness of England--line upon line, wall upon"
3019,A MATTER OF FACT.,"wall, solid stone dock and monolithic pier. We waited an hour in the"
3020,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Customs shed, and there was ample time for the effect to soak in."
3021,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3022,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Now, Keller, you face the music. The _Havel_ goes out to-day. Mail"
3023,A MATTER OF FACT.,"by her, and I'll take you to the telegraph-office,' I said."
3024,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3025,A MATTER OF FACT.,"I heard Keller gasp as the influence of the land closed about him,"
3026,A MATTER OF FACT.,cowing him as they say Newmarket Heath cows a young horse unused to
3027,A MATTER OF FACT.,open courses.
3028,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3029,A MATTER OF FACT.,'I want to retouch my stuff. Suppose we wait till we get to London?'
3030,A MATTER OF FACT.,he said.
3031,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3032,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Zuyland, by the way, had torn up his account and thrown it  overboard"
3033,A MATTER OF FACT.,that morning early. His reasons were my reasons.
3034,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3035,A MATTER OF FACT.,"In the train Keller began to revise his copy, and every time that he"
3036,A MATTER OF FACT.,"looked at the trim little fields, the red villas, and the embankments"
3037,A MATTER OF FACT.,"of the line, the blue pencil plunged remorselessly through the slips."
3038,A MATTER OF FACT.,He appeared to have dredged the dictionary for adjectives. I could
3039,A MATTER OF FACT.,think of none that he had not used. Yet he was a perfectly sound
3040,A MATTER OF FACT.,poker-player and never showed more cards than were sufficient to take
3041,A MATTER OF FACT.,the pool.
3042,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3043,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Aren't you going to leave him a single bellow?' I asked
3044,A MATTER OF FACT.,"sympathetically. 'Remember, everything goes in the States, from a"
3045,A MATTER OF FACT.,trouser-button to a double-eagle.'
3046,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3047,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'That's just the curse of it,' said Keller below his breath. 'We've"
3048,A MATTER OF FACT.,played 'em for suckers so often that when it comes to the golden
3049,A MATTER OF FACT.,truth--I'd like to try this on a London paper. You have first call
3050,A MATTER OF FACT.,"there, though.'"
3051,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3052,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Not in the least. I'm not touching the thing in our papers. I shall
3053,A MATTER OF FACT.,be happy to leave 'em all to you; but surely you'll cable it home?'
3054,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3055,A MATTER OF FACT.,'No. Not if I can make the scoop here and see the Britishers sit up.'
3056,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3057,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'You won't do it with three columns of slushy headline, believe me."
3058,A MATTER OF FACT.,They don't sit up as quickly as some people.'
3059,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3060,A MATTER OF FACT.,'I'm beginning to think that too. Does _nothing_ make any difference
3061,A MATTER OF FACT.,"in this country?' he said, looking out of the window. 'How old is"
3062,A MATTER OF FACT.,that farmhouse?'
3063,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3064,A MATTER OF FACT.,'New. It can't be more than two hundred years at the most.'
3065,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3066,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Urn. Fields, too?'"
3067,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3068,A MATTER OF FACT.,'That hedge there must have been clipped for about eighty years.'
3069,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3070,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Labour cheap--eh?'
3071,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3072,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Pretty much. Well, I suppose you'd like to try the _Times_, wouldn't"
3073,A MATTER OF FACT.,you?'
3074,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3075,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'No,' said Keller, looking at Winchester Cathedral. ''Might as well"
3076,A MATTER OF FACT.,try to electrify a haystack. And to think that the _World_ would take
3077,A MATTER OF FACT.,three columns and ask for more--with illustrations too! It's
3078,A MATTER OF FACT.,sickening.'
3079,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3080,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'But the _Times_ might,' I began."
3081,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3082,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Keller flung his paper across the carriage, and it opened in its"
3083,A MATTER OF FACT.,austere majesty of solid type--opened with the crackle of an
3084,A MATTER OF FACT.,encyclopædia.
3085,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3086,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Might! You _might_ work your way through the bow-plates of a
3087,A MATTER OF FACT.,cruiser. Look at that first page!'
3088,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3089,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'It strikes you that way, does it?' I said. 'Then I'd recommend you"
3090,A MATTER OF FACT.,to try a light and frivolous journal.'
3091,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3092,A MATTER OF FACT.,'With a thing like this of mine--of ours? It's sacred history!'
3093,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3094,A MATTER OF FACT.,"I showed him a paper which I conceived would be after his own heart,"
3095,A MATTER OF FACT.,in that it was modelled on American lines.
3096,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3097,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'That's homey,' he said, 'but it's not the real thing. Now, I should"
3098,A MATTER OF FACT.,like one of these fat old _Times_ columns. Probably there'd be a
3099,A MATTER OF FACT.,"bishop in the office, though.'"
3100,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3101,A MATTER OF FACT.,When we reached London Keller disappeared in the direction of the
3102,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Strand. What his experiences may have been I cannot tell, but it"
3103,A MATTER OF FACT.,seems that he invaded the office of an evening paper at 11.45 a.m. (I
3104,A MATTER OF FACT.,"told him English editors were most idle at that hour), and mentioned"
3105,A MATTER OF FACT.,my name as that of a witness to the truth of his story.
3106,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3107,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'I was nearly fired out,' he said furiously at lunch. 'As soon as I"
3108,A MATTER OF FACT.,"mentioned you, the old man said that I was to tell you that they"

3111,A MATTER OF FACT.,condemned before they helped to puff one of your infernal yarns in

3113,A MATTER OF FACT.,anyway?'
3114,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3115,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'A beauty. You ran up against it, that's all. Why don't you leave the"

3119,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Can't you see that's just why?' he repeated.
3120,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3121,A MATTER OF FACT.,'I saw it a long time ago. You don't intend to cable then?'
3122,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3123,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Yes, I do,' he answered, in the over-emphatic voice of one who does"
3124,A MATTER OF FACT.,not know his own mind.
3125,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3126,A MATTER OF FACT.,"That afternoon I walked him abroad and about, over the streets that"
3127,A MATTER OF FACT.,"run between the pavements like channels of grooved and tongued lava,"
3128,A MATTER OF FACT.,"over the bridges that are made of enduring stone, through subways"
3129,A MATTER OF FACT.,"floored and sided with yard-thick concrete, between houses that are"
3130,A MATTER OF FACT.,"never rebuilt, and by river steps hewn, to the eye, from the living"
3131,A MATTER OF FACT.,"rock. A black fog chased us into Westminster Abbey, and, standing"
3132,A MATTER OF FACT.,"there in the darkness, I could hear the wings of the dead centuries"
3133,A MATTER OF FACT.,"circling round the head of Litchfield A. Keller, journalist, of"
3134,A MATTER OF FACT.,"Dayton, Ohio, U.S.A., whose mission it was to make the Britishers sit"

3136,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3137,A MATTER OF FACT.,"He stumbled gasping into the thick gloom, and the roar of the traffic"

3140,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Let's go to the telegraph-office and cable,' I said. 'Can't you hear"
3141,A MATTER OF FACT.,"the New York _World_ crying for news of the great sea-serpent, blind,"

3146,A MATTER OF FACT.,"lively! Both gates! Szz! Boom! Aah!' Keller was a Princeton man, and"
3147,A MATTER OF FACT.,he seemed to need encouragement.
3148,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3149,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'You've got me on your own ground,' said he, tugging at his overcoat"
3150,A MATTER OF FACT.,"pocket. He pulled out his copy, with the cable forms--for he had"
3151,A MATTER OF FACT.,"written out his telegram--and put them all into my hand, groaning, 'I"

3154,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3155,A MATTER OF FACT.,"'Never mind, Keller. It isn't your fault. It's the fault of your"

3158,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3159,A MATTER OF FACT.,'What are you going to do?'
3160,A MATTER OF FACT.,
3161,A MATTER OF FACT.,'Tell it as a lie.'
3162,A MATTER OF FACT.,

3166,A MATTER OF FACT.,'You can call it that if you like. I shall call it a lie.'

3177,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3178,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Now Chil the Kite brings home the night
3179,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,That Mang the Bat sets free--
3180,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,The herds are shut in byre and hut
3181,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,For loosed till dawn are we.
3182,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"This is the hour of pride and power,"
3183,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Talon and tush and claw.
3184,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Oh hear the call!--Good hunting all
3185,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,That keep the Jungle Law!
3186,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3187,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,_Night-Song in the Jungle_.
3188,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3189,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
3190,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned,"
3191,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy
3192,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped
3193,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the"
3194,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"mouth of the cave where they all lived. 'Augrh!' said Father Wolf,"
3195,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'it is time to hunt again'; and he was going to spring down hill when
3196,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined:
3197,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves; and good luck and"
3198,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"strong white teeth go with the noble children, that they may never"
3199,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,forget the hungry in this world.'
3200,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3201,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India"
3202,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling"
3203,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village"
3204,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more"
3205,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"than any one else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he"
3206,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"forgets that he was ever afraid of any one, and runs through the"
3207,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,forest biting everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides
3208,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful"
3209,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but"
3210,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,they call it _dewanee_--the madness--and run.
3211,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3212,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Enter, then, and look,' said Father Wolf, stiffly; 'but there is no"
3213,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,food here.'
3214,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3215,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'For a wolf, no,' said Tabaqui; 'but for so mean a person as myself a"
3216,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal"
3217,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"people], to pick and choose?' He scuttled to the back of the cave,"
3218,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat"
3219,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,cracking the end merrily.
3220,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3221,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'All thanks for this good meal,' he said, licking his lips. 'How"
3222,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so
3223,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children"
3224,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,of kings are men from the beginning.'
3225,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3226,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Now, Tabaqui knew as well as any one else that there is nothing so"
3227,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,unlucky as to compliment children to their faces; and it pleased him
3228,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.
3229,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3230,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and"
3231,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,then he said spitefully:
3232,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3233,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting-grounds. He will"
3234,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"hunt among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.'"
3235,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3236,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty"
3237,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,miles away.
3238,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3239,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'He has no right!' Father Wolf began angrily--'By the Law of the
3240,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He
3241,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"will frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to"
3242,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"kill for two, these days.'"
3243,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3244,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,' said"
3245,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Mother Wolf, quietly. He has been lame in one foot from his birth."
3246,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,That is why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the
3247,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Waingunga are angry with him, and he has come here to make _our_"
3248,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,villagers angry. They will scour the jungle for him when he is far
3249,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"away, and we and our children must run when the grass is set alight."
3250,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Indeed, we are very grateful to Shere Khan!'"
3251,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3252,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Shall I tell him of your gratitude?' said Tabaqui.
3253,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3254,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Out!' snapped Father Wolf. 'Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast
3255,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,done harm enough for one night.'
3256,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3257,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'I go,' said Tabaqui, quietly. 'Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the"
3258,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,thickets. I might have saved myself the message.'
3259,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3260,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a"
3261,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"little river, he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a"
3262,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle
3263,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,knows it.
3264,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3265,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'The fool!' said Father Wolf. 'To begin a night's work with that
3266,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,noise. Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga
3267,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,bullocks?'
3268,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3269,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'H'sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,' said Mother"
3270,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Wolf. 'It is Man.' The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr
3271,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass. It was the
3272,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"noise that bewilders woodcutters and gipsies sleeping in the open,"
3273,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.
3274,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3275,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Man!' said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. 'Faugh! Are"
3276,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man,"
3277,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,and on our ground too!'
3278,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3279,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason,"
3280,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his
3281,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the"
3282,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,hunting-grounds of his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is
3283,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on"
3284,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and"
3285,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason
3286,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most
3287,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"defenceless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch"
3288,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"him. They say too--and it is true--that man-eaters become mangy, and"
3289,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,lose their teeth.
3290,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3291,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated 'Aaarh!' of the"
3292,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,tiger's charge.
3293,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3294,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan.  He has
3295,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"missed,' said Mother Wolf. 'What is it?'"
3296,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3297,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and
3298,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"mumbling savagely, as he tumbled about in the scrub."
3299,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3300,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutters'
3301,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"camp-fire, and has burned his feet,' said Father Wolf, with a grunt."
3302,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Tabaqui is with him.'
3303,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3304,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Something is coming up hill,' said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear."
3305,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Get ready.'
3306,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3307,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped"
3308,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had"
3309,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"been watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the"
3310,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,world--the wolf checked in mid spring. He made his bound before he
3311,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"saw what it was he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself."
3312,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,The result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five
3313,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"feet, landing almost where he left ground."
3314,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3315,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Man!' he snapped. 'A man's cub. Look!'
3316,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3317,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked"
3318,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom
3319,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,as ever came to a wolf's cave at night. He looked up into Father
3320,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Wolf's face, and laughed."
3321,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3322,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Is that a man's cub?' said Mother Wolf. 'I have never seen one.
3323,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Bring it here.'
3324,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3325,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"A wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an"
3326,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolf's jaws closed right"
3327,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"on the child's back not a tooth even scratched the skin, as he laid"
3328,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,it down among the cubs.
3329,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3330,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'How little! How naked, and--how bold!' said Mother Wolf, softly. The"
3331,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm
3332,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,hide. 'Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a
3333,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"man's cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man's cub"
3334,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,among her children?'
3335,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3336,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or"
3337,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"in my time,' said Father Wolf. 'He is altogether without hair, and I"
3338,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is"
3339,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,not afraid.'
3340,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3341,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere"
3342,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Khan's great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance.
3343,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Tabaqui, behind him, was squeaking: 'My lord, my lord, it went in"
3344,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,here!'
3345,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3346,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Shere Khan does us great honour,' said Father Wolf, but his eyes"
3347,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,were very angry. 'What does Shere Khan need?'
3348,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3349,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'My quarry. A man's cub went this way,' said Shere Khan. 'Its parents"
3350,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,have run off. Give it to me.'
3351,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3352,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutters' camp-fire, as Father Wolf had"
3353,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"said, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father"
3354,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to
3355,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"come in by. Even where he was, Shere Khan's shoulders and fore paws"
3356,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"were cramped for want of room, as a man's would be if he tried to"
3357,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,fight in a barrel.
3358,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3359,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'The Wolves are a free people,' said Father Wolf. 'They take orders"
3360,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"from the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-dealer."
3361,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,The man's cub is ours--to kill if we choose.'
3362,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3363,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By
3364,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog's den for"
3365,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"my fair dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!'"
3366,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3367,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,The tiger's roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook
3368,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two"
3369,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"green moons in the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan."
3370,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3371,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answer. The man's cub is mine,"
3372,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Lungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with
3373,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter"
3374,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,of little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt _thee_!
3375,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Now get hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (_I_ eat no starved"
3376,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"cattle), back thou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle,"
3377,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,lamer than ever thou earnest into the world! Go!'
3378,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3379,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when
3380,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"he had won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she"
3381,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,ran in the Pack and was not called The Demon for compliment's sake.
3382,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Shere Khan might have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up"
3383,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"against Mother Wolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the"
3384,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"advantage of the ground, and would fight to the death. So he backed"
3385,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"out of the cave-mouth growling, and when he was clear he shouted:--"
3386,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3387,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say
3388,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"to this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he"
3389,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"will come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!'"
3390,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3391,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father"
3392,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Wolf said to her gravely:--
3393,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3394,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the
3395,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Pack. Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?'"
3396,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3397,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Keep him!' she gasped. 'He came naked, by night, alone and very"
3398,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"hungry; yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to"
3399,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,one side already. And that lame butcher would have killed him and
3400,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,would have run off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted
3401,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,through all our lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep
3402,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"him. Lie still, little frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I"
3403,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,will call thee--the time will come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as
3404,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,he has hunted thee.' 'But what will our Pack say?' said Father Wolf.
3405,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when"
3406,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"he marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to; but as soon as his"
3407,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the
3408,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Pack Council, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in"
3409,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,order that the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection
3410,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the cubs are free to run where they please, and until they have"
3411,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the
3412,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Pack kills one of them. The punishment is death where the murderer
3413,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,can be found; and if you think for a minute you will see that this
3414,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"must be so. Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and"
3415,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,then on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother
3416,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Wolf to the Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders
3417,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"where a hundred wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf,"
3418,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length"
3419,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and"
3420,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"colour, from badger-coloured veterans who could handle a buck alone,"
3421,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,to young black three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf
3422,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,had led them for a year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf-trap in
3423,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"his youth, and once he had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew"
3424,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the manners and customs of men. There was very little talking at the
3425,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,rock. The cubs tumbled over each other in the centre of the circle
3426,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"where their mothers and fathers sat, and now and again a senior wolf"
3427,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"would go quietly up to a cub, look at him carefully, and return to"
3428,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,his place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a mother would push her cub
3429,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"far out into the moonlight, to be sure that he had not been"
3430,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: 'Ye know the Law--ye know
3431,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the Law. Look well, O Wolves!' and the anxious mothers would take up"
3432,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the call: 'Look--look well, O Wolves!'"
3433,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3434,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,At last--and Mother Wolfs neck-bristles lifted as the time
3435,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"came--Father Wolf pushed 'Mowgli the Frog,' as they called him, into"
3436,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the centre, where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that"
3437,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,glistened in the moonlight.
3438,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3439,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the"
3440,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,monotonous cry: 'Look well!' A muffled roar came up from behind the
3441,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: 'The cub is mine. Give him to
3442,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,me. What have the Free People to do with a man's cub?' Akela never
3443,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"even twitched his ears: all he said was: 'Look well, O Wolves! What"
3444,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,have the Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free
3445,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,People? Look well!'
3446,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3447,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth"
3448,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,year flung back Shere Khan's question to Akela: 'What have the Free
3449,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,People to do with a man's cub?' Now the Law of the Jungle lays down
3450,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted
3451,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the"
3452,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Pack who are not his father and mother.
3453,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3454,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Who speaks for this cub?' said Akela. 'Among the Free People who
3455,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"speaks?' There was no answer, and Mother Wolf got ready for what she"
3456,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"knew would be her last fight, if things came to fighting."
3457,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3458,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack
3459,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Council--Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the"
3460,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases"
3461,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,because he eats only nuts and roots and honey--rose up on his hind
3462,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,quarters and grunted.
3463,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3464,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'The man's cub--the man's cub?' he said. '_I_ speak for the man's
3465,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"cub. There is no harm in a man's cub. I have no gift of words, but I"
3466,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the"
3467,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,others. I myself will teach him.'
3468,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3469,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'We need yet another,' said Akela. 'Baloo has spoken, and he is our"
3470,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks beside Baloo?'
3471,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3472,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the
3473,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings"
3474,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk.
3475,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he"
3476,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as"
3477,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild
3478,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down."
3479,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3480,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'O Akela, and ye the Free People,' he purred, 'I have no right in"
3481,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,your assembly; but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a
3482,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life"
3483,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who
3484,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,may or may not pay that price. Am I right?'
3485,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3486,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Good! good!' said the young wolves, who are always hungry. 'Listen"
3487,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.'
3488,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3489,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.'"
3490,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3491,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Speak then,' cried twenty voices."
3492,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3493,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for"
3494,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo's
3495,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a"
3496,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"mile from here, if ye will accept the man's cub according to the Law."
3497,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Is it difficult?'
3498,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3499,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"There was a clamour of scores of voices, saying: 'What matter? He"
3500,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm
3501,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull,"
3502,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Bagheera? Let him be accepted.' And then came Akela's deep bay,"
3503,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"crying: Look well--look well, O Wolves!'"
3504,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3505,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not"
3506,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last
3507,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela,"
3508,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli's own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared"
3509,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been"
3510,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,handed over to him.
3511,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3512,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Ay, roar well,' said Bagheera, under his whiskers; 'for the time"
3513,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"comes when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I"
3514,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,know nothing of man.'
3515,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3516,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'It was well done,' said Akela. 'Men and their cubs are very wise. He"
3517,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,may be a help in time.'
3518,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3519,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack"
3520,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"for ever,' said Bagheera."
3521,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3522,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every
3523,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets
3524,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a"
3525,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,new leader comes up--to be killed in his turn.
3526,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3527,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Take him away,' he said to Father Wolf, 'and train him as befits one"
3528,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,of the Free People.'
3529,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3530,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee wolf-pack for the
3531,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,price of a bull and on Baloo's good word.
3532,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3533,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,*       *       *       *       *
3534,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3535,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only"
3536,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"guess at all the wonderful life Mowgli led among the wolves, because"
3537,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up
3538,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost"
3539,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"before he was a child, and Father Wolf taught him his business, and"
3540,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass,"
3541,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his"
3542,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"head, every scratch of a bat's claws as it roosted for a while in a"
3543,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool, meant"
3544,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business
3545,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and"
3546,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,ate and went to sleep again; when he felt dirty or hot he swam in the
3547,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and
3548,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it,"
3549,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,and that Bagheera showed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a
3550,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"branch and call, 'Come along, Little Brother,' and at first Mowgli"
3551,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"would cling like the sloth, but afterward he would fling himself"
3552,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape. He took his
3553,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"place at the Council Rock, too, when the Pack met, and there he"
3554,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf, the wolf would be"
3555,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare for fun. At other"
3556,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends,"
3557,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats. He
3558,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night, and"
3559,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a"
3560,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a
3561,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,drop-gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked
3562,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"into it, and told him that it was a trap. He loved better than"
3563,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,anything else to go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the
3564,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"forest, to sleep all through the drowsy day, and at night see how"
3565,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Bagheera did his killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt
3566,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"hungry, and so did Mowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old"
3567,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"enough to understand things, Bagheera told him that he must never"
3568,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,touch cattle because he had been bought into the Pack at the price
3569,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"of a bull's life. 'All the jungle is thine,' said Bagheera, 'and thou"
3570,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to kill; but for
3571,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the sake of the bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat any
3572,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,cattle young or old. That is the Law of the Jungle.' Mowgli obeyed
3573,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,faithfully.
3574,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3575,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,And he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that
3576,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"he is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think"
3577,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,of except things to eat.
3578,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3579,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Mother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature
3580,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"to be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan; but though"
3581,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"a young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli"
3582,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,forgot it because he was only a boy--though he would have called
3583,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,himself a wolf if he had been able to speak in any human tongue.
3584,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3585,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Shere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela"
3586,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends
3587,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"with the younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a"
3588,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,thing Akela would never have allowed if he had dared to push his
3589,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,authority to the proper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them
3590,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,and wonder that such fine young hunters were content to be led by a
3591,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"dying wolf and a man's cub. 'They tell me,' Shere Khan would say,"
3592,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'that at Council ye dare not look him between the eyes'; and the
3593,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,young wolves would growl and bristle.
3594,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3595,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this,"
3596,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,and once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan
3597,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,would kill him some day; and Mowgli would laugh and answer: 'I have
3598,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the Pack and I have thee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy, might"
3599,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,strike a blow or two for my sake. Why should I be afraid?'
3600,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3601,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,It was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of
3602,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,something that he had heard. Perhaps Sahi the Porcupine had told him;
3603,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"but he said to Mowgli when they were deep in the jungle, as the boy"
3604,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,lay with his head on Bagheera's beautiful black skin: 'Little
3605,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Brother,' how often have I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?'"
3606,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3607,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'As many times as there are nuts on that palm,' said Mowgli, who,"
3608,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"naturally, could not count. 'What of it? I am sleepy, Bagheera, and"
3609,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mor the Peacock.'
3610,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3611,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the
3612,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Pack know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has"
3613,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"told thee, too.'"
3614,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3615,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Ho! ho!' said Mowgli. 'Tabaqui came to me not long ago with some
3616,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,rude talk that I was a naked man's cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts;
3617,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,but I caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a
3618,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,palm-tree to teach him better manners.'
3619,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3620,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'That was foolishness; for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker, he"
3621,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,would have told thee of something that concerned thee closely. Open
3622,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"those eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the"
3623,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"jungle; but remember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when"
3624,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"he cannot kill his buck, and then he will be leader no more. Many of"
3625,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the wolves that looked thee over when thou wast brought to the
3626,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Council first are old too, and the young wolves believe, as Shere"
3627,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Khan has taught them, that a man-cub has no place with the Pack. In a"
3628,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,little time thou wilt be a man.'
3629,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3630,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?' said
3631,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Mowgli. 'I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the
3632,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Jungle, and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not"
3633,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,pulled a thorn. Surely they are my brothers!'
3634,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3635,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes.
3636,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Little Brother,' said he, 'feel under my jaw.'"
3637,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3638,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Mowgli put up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera's silky"
3639,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"chin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy"
3640,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"hair, he came upon a little bald spot."
3641,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3642,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'There is no one in the jungle that knows that I, Bagheera, carry"
3643,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"that mark--the mark of the collar; and yet, Little Brother, I was"
3644,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"born among men, and it was among men that my mother died--in the"
3645,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,cages of the King's Palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this that
3646,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,I paid the price for thee at the Council when thou wast a little
3647,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"naked cub. Yes, I too was born among men. I had never seen the"
3648,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,jungle. They fed me behind bars from an iron pan till one night I
3649,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"felt that I was Bagheera--the Panther--and no man's plaything, and I"
3650,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,broke the silly lock with one blow of my paw and came away; and
3651,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"because I had learned the ways of men, I became more terrible in the"
3652,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,jungle than Shere Khan. Is it not so?'
3653,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3654,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Yes,' said Mowgli;' all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except"
3655,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Mowgli.'
3656,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3657,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Oh, _thou_ art a man's cub,' said the Black Panther, very"
3658,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"tenderly; 'and even as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back"
3659,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"to men at last,--to the men who are thy brothers,--if thou art not"
3660,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,killed in the Council.'
3661,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3662,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'But why--but why should any wish to kill me?' said Mowgli.
3663,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3664,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Look at me,' said Bagheera; and Mowgli looked at him steadily"
3665,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,between the eyes. The big panther turned his head away in half a
3666,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,minute.
3667,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3668,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'_That_ is why,' he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. 'Not even I"
3669,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"can look thee between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love"
3670,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"thee, Little Brother. The others they hate thee because their eyes"
3671,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,cannot meet thine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled
3672,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,out thorns from their feet--because thou art a man.'
3673,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3674,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'I did not know these things,' said Mowgli, sullenly; and he frowned"
3675,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,under his heavy black eyebrows.
3676,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3677,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'What is the Law of the Jungle? Strike first and then give tongue. By
3678,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But be wise. It
3679,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"is in my heart that when Akela misses his next kill,--and at each"
3680,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"hunt it costs him more to pin the buck,--the Pack will turn against"
3681,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"him and against thee. They will hold a jungle Council at the Rock,"
3682,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"and then--and then--I have it!' said Bagheera, leaping up. 'Go thou"
3683,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"down quickly to the men's huts in the valley, and take some of the"
3684,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Red Flower which they grow there, so that when the time comes thou"
3685,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,mayest have even a stronger friend than I or Baloo or those of the
3686,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Pack that love thee. Get the Red Flower.'
3687,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3688,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle"
3689,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,will call fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear
3690,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"of it, and invents a hundred ways of describing it."
3691,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3692,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'The Red Flower?' said Mowgli. 'That grows outside their huts in the
3693,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,twilight. I will get some.'
3694,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3695,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'There speaks the man's cub,' said Bagheera, proudly. 'Remember that"
3696,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"it grows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for"
3697,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,time of need.'
3698,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3699,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Good!' said Mowgli. 'I go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheera'--he"
3700,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"slipped his arm round the splendid neck, and looked deep into the big"
3701,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,eyes--' art thou sure that all this is Shere Khan's doing?'
3702,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3703,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.'"
3704,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3705,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale"
3706,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"for this, and it may be a little over,' said Mowgli; and he bounded"
3707,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,away.
3708,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3709,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'That is a man. That is all a man,' said Bagheera to himself, lying"
3710,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"down again. 'Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that"
3711,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,frog-hunt of thine ten years ago!'
3712,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3713,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Mowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his"
3714,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"heart was hot in him. He came to the cave as the evening mist rose,"
3715,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"and drew breath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but"
3716,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Mother Wolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his breathing that"
3717,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,something was troubling her frog.
3718,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3719,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'What is it, Son?' she said."
3720,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3721,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Some bat's chatter of Shere Khan,' he called back. 'I hunt among the"
3722,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,ploughed fields to-night'; and he plunged downward through the
3723,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"bushes, to the stream at the bottom of the valley. There he checked,"
3724,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"for he heard the yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a"
3725,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"hunted Sambhur, and the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there"
3726,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"were wicked, bitter howls from the young wolves: 'Akela! Akela! Let"
3727,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the Lone Wolf show his strength. Room for the leader of the Pack!
3728,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Spring, Akela!'"
3729,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3730,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli heard"
3731,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over
3732,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,with his fore foot.
3733,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3734,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"He did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew"
3735,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers
3736,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,lived.
3737,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3738,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Bagheera spoke truth,' he panted, as he nestled down in some"
3739,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,cattle-fodder by the window of a hut. 'To-morrow is one day both for
3740,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Akela and for me.'
3741,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3742,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on
3743,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the hearth. He saw the husbandman's wife get up and feed it in the
3744,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,night with black lumps; and when the morning came and the mists were
3745,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"all white and cold, he saw the man's child pick up a wicker pot"
3746,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"plastered inside with earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal,"
3747,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"put it under his blanket, and go out to tend the cows in the byre."
3748,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3749,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Is that all?' said Mowgli. 'If a cub can do it, there is nothing to"
3750,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"fear'; so he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot"
3751,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"from his hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled"
3752,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,with fear.
3753,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3754,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'They are very like me,' said Mowgli, blowing into the pot, as he had"
3755,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,seen the woman do. 'This thing will die if I do not give it things to
3756,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,eat'; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Half-way
3757,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,up the hill he met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like
3758,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,moonstones on his coat.
3759,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3760,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Akela has missed,' said the Panther. 'They would have killed him"
3761,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"last night, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on"
3762,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the hill.'
3763,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3764,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'I was among the ploughed lands. I am ready. See!' Mowgli held up the
3765,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,fire-pot.
3766,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3767,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Good! Now I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and"
3768,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not
3769,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,afraid?'
3770,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3771,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is not a dream--how,"
3772,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"before I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and"
3773,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,pleasant.'
3774,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3775,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,All that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire-pot and dipping
3776,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,dry branches into it to see how they looked. He found a branch that
3777,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"satisfied him, and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and"
3778,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"told him rudely enough that he was wanted at the Council Rock, he"
3779,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"laughed till Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still"
3780,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,laughing.
3781,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3782,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Akela the lone wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the
3783,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"leadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his following of"
3784,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,scrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered. Bagheera
3785,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"lay close to Mowgli, and the fire-pot was between Mowgli's knees."
3786,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"When they were all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a"
3787,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,thing he would never have dared to do when Akela was in his prime.
3788,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3789,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'He has no right,' whispered Bagheera. 'Say so. He is a dog's son."
3790,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,He will be frightened.'
3791,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3792,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Mowgli sprang to his feet. 'Free People,' he cried, does Shere Khan"
3793,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,lead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?'
3794,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3795,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to"
3796,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,speak--' Shere Khan began.
3797,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3798,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'By whom?' said Mowgli. 'Are we _all_ jackals, to fawn on this"
3799,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,cattle-butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.'
3800,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3801,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"There were yells of 'Silence, thou man's cub!' 'Let him speak. He has"
3802,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,kept our Law'; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: 'Let
3803,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"the Dead Wolf speak.' When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill,"
3804,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"he is called the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long."
3805,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3806,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Akela raised his old head wearily:--
3807,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3808,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons"
3809,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"I have led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has"
3810,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,been trapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill. Ye know how that
3811,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,plot was made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to
3812,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,make my weakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill
3813,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"me here on the Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make"
3814,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"an end of the Lone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the"
3815,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Jungle, that ye come one by one.'"
3816,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3817,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"There was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to the"
3818,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,death. Then Shere Khan roared: 'Bah! what have we to do with this
3819,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,toothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the man-cub who has lived
3820,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"too long. Free People, he was my meat from the first. Give him to me."
3821,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,I am weary of this man-wolf folly. He has troubled the jungle for ten
3822,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"seasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not"
3823,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"give you one bone. He is a man, a man's child, and from the marrow of"
3824,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,my bones I hate him!'
3825,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3826,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Then more than half the Pack yelled:  A man! a man!
3827,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3828,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,What has a man to do with us? Let him go to his own place.
3829,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3830,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'And turn all the people of the villages against us?' clamoured Shere
3831,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Khan. 'No; give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him"
3832,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,between the eyes.'
3833,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3834,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Akela lifted his head again, and said: 'He has eaten our food. He has"
3835,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,slept with us. He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of
3836,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the Law of the Jungle.'
3837,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3838,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Also, I paid for him with a Bull when he was accepted. The worth of"
3839,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"a bull is little, but Bagheera's honour is something that he will"
3840,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"perhaps fight for,' said Bagheera, in his gentlest voice."
3841,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3842,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'A bull paid ten years ago!' the Pack snarled. 'What do we care for
3843,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,bones ten years old?'
3844,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3845,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Or for a pledge?' said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his"
3846,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,lip. 'Well are ye called the Free People!'
3847,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3848,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'No man's cub can run with the people of the jungle,' howled Shere"
3849,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Khan. 'Give him to me!'
3850,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3851,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'He is our brother in all but blood,' Akela went on; 'and ye would"
3852,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"kill him here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters"
3853,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"of cattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khan's"
3854,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"teaching, ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager's"
3855,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"door-step Therefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I"
3856,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"speak. It is certain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or"
3857,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,I would offer that in the man-cub's place. But for the sake of the
3858,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Honour of the Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader"
3859,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"ye have forgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub go to his"
3860,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"own place, I will not, when my time comes to die, bare one tooth"
3861,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,against ye. I will die without fighting. That will at least save the
3862,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Pack three lives. More I cannot do; but if ye will, I can save ye the"
3863,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,shame that comes of killing a brother against whom there is no
3864,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"fault,--a brother spoken for and bought into the Pack according to"
3865,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,the Law of the Jungle.'
3866,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3867,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'He is a man--a man--a man--!' snarled the Pack; and most of the
3868,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"wolves began to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to"
3869,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,switch.
3870,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3871,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Now the business is in thy hands,' said Bagheera to Mowgli. '_We_"
3872,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,can do no more except fight.'
3873,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3874,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Mowgli stood upright--the fire-pot in his hands. Then he stretched
3875,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"out his arms, and yawned in the face of the Council; but he was"
3876,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"furious with rage and sorrow, for, wolf-like, the wolves had never"
3877,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,told him how they hated him. 'Listen you!' he cried. 'There is no
3878,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,need for this dog's jabber. Ye have told me so often to night that I
3879,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,am a man (and indeed I would have been a wolf with you to my life's
3880,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"end), that I feel your words are true. So I do not call ye my"
3881,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"brothers any more, but _sag_ [dogs], as a man should. What ye will"
3882,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"do, and what ye will not do, is not yours to say. That matter is with"
3883,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"_me_; and that we may see the matter more plainly, I, the man, have"
3884,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"brought here a little of the Red Flower which ye, dogs, fear.'"
3885,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3886,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"He flung the fire-pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit a"
3887,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in"
3888,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,terror before the leaping flames.
3889,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3890,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and
3891,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"crackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves."
3892,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3893,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Thou art the master,' said Bagheera, in an undertone. 'Save Akela"
3894,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"from, the death. He was ever thy friend.'"
3895,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3896,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life,"
3897,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"gave one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long"
3898,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,black hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing
3899,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,branch that made the shadows jump and quiver.
3900,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3901,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Good!' said Mowgli, staring round slowly. 'I see that ye are dogs. I"
3902,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,go from you to my own people--if they be ray own people. The jungle
3903,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"is shut to me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship;"
3904,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,but I will be more merciful than ye are. Because I was all but your
3905,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"brother in blood, I promise that when I am a man among men I will not"
3906,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me.' He kicked the fire with his
3907,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"foot, and the sparks flew up. 'There shall be no war between any of"
3908,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,us in the Pack. But here is a debt to pay before I go.' He strode
3909,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"forward to where Shere Khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames, and"
3910,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,caught him by the tuft on his chin. Bagheera followed in case of
3911,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"accidents. 'Up, dog!' Mowgli cried. 'Up, when a man speaks, or I will"
3912,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,set that coat ablaze!'
3913,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3914,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Shere Khan's ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes,"
3915,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,for the blazing branch was very near.
3916,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3917,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'This cattle-killer said he would kill me in the Council because he
3918,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"had not killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat"
3919,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"dogs when we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red"
3920,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Flower down thy gullet!' He beat Shere Khan over the head with the
3921,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"branch, and the tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear."
3922,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3923,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Pah! Singed jungle-cat--go now! But remember when next I come to the
3924,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Council Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khan's hide"
3925,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"on my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases. Ye"
3926,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"will _not_ kill him, because that is not my will. Nor do I think that"
3927,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"ye will sit here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye"
3928,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"were somebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!' The"
3929,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli"
3930,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"struck right and left round the circle, and the wolves ran howling"
3931,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"with the sparks burning their fur. At last there were only Akela,"
3932,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Bagheera, and perhaps ten wolves that had taken Mowgli's part. Then"
3933,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"something began to hurt Mowgli inside him, as he had never been hurt"
3934,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"in his life before, and he caught his breath and sobbed, and the"
3935,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,tears ran down his face.
3936,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3937,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'What is it? What is it?' he said. 'I do not wish to leave the
3938,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"jungle, and I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?'"
3939,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3940,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'No, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use,' said"
3941,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"Bagheera. 'Now I know thou art a man, and a man's cub no longer. The"
3942,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward. Let them fall, Mowgli."
3943,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,They are only tears.' So Mowgli sat and cried as though his heart
3944,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,would break; and he had never cried in all his life before.
3945,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3946,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Now,' he said, 'I will go to men. But first I must say farewell to"
3947,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"my mother'; and he went to the cave where she lived with Father Wolf,"
3948,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"and he cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably."
3949,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3950,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,'Ye will not forget me?' said Mowgli.
3951,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3952,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Never while we can follow a trail,' said the cubs. 'Come to the foot"
3953,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"of the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we"
3954,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,will come into the crop-lands to play with thee by night.'
3955,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3956,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Come soon!' said Father Wolf. 'Oh, wise little frog, come again"
3957,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"soon; for we be old, thy mother and I.'"
3958,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3959,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'Come soon,' said Mother Wolf, 'little naked son of mine; for,"
3960,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"listen, child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.'"
3961,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3962,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"'I will surely come,' said Mowgli; 'and when I come it will be to"
3963,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,lay out Shere Khan's hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me!
3964,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,Tell them in the jungle never to forget me!'
3965,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3966,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,The dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside
3967,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,"alone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men."
3968,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3969,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,

3971,MOWGLI'S BROTHERS,
3972,THE LOST LEGION.,THE LOST LEGION.
3973,THE LOST LEGION.,
3974,THE LOST LEGION.,"When the Indian Mutiny broke out, and a little time before the siege"
3975,THE LOST LEGION.,"of Delhi, a regiment of Native Irregular Horse was stationed at"
3976,THE LOST LEGION.,Peshawur on the Frontier of India. That regiment caught what John
3977,THE LOST LEGION.,"Lawrence called at the time 'the prevalent mania,' and would have"
3978,THE LOST LEGION.,thrown in its lot with the mutineers had it been allowed to do so.
3979,THE LOST LEGION.,"The chance never came, for, as the regiment swept off down south, it"
3980,THE LOST LEGION.,was headed up by a remnant of an English corps into the hills of
3981,THE LOST LEGION.,"Afghanistan, and there the newly-conquered tribesmen turned against"
3982,THE LOST LEGION.,it as wolves turn against buck. It was hunted for the sake of its
3983,THE LOST LEGION.,"arms and accoutrements from hill to hill, from ravine to ravine, up"
3984,THE LOST LEGION.,"and down the dried beds of rivers and round the shoulders of bluffs,"
3985,THE LOST LEGION.,"till it disappeared as  water  sinks in the sand--this officerless,"
3986,THE LOST LEGION.,rebel regiment. The only trace left of its existence to-day is a
3987,THE LOST LEGION.,nominal roll drawn up in neat round hand and countersigned by an
3988,THE LOST LEGION.,"officer who  called himself  'Adjutant, late ---- Irregular Cavalry.'"
3989,THE LOST LEGION.,"The paper is yellow with years and dirt, but on the back of it you"
3990,THE LOST LEGION.,"can still read a pencil note by John Lawrence, to this effect: 'See"
3991,THE LOST LEGION.,that the two native officers who remained loyal are not deprived of
3992,THE LOST LEGION.,their estates.--J.L.'  Of six hundred and fifty sabres only two stood
3993,THE LOST LEGION.,"strain, and John Lawrence in the midst of all the agony of the first"
3994,THE LOST LEGION.,months of the mutiny found time to think about their merits.
3995,THE LOST LEGION.,
3996,THE LOST LEGION.,"That was more than thirty years ago, and the tribesmen across the"
3997,THE LOST LEGION.,Afghan border who helped to annihilate the regiment are now old men.
3998,THE LOST LEGION.,Sometimes a graybeard speaks of his share in the massacre. 'They
3999,THE LOST LEGION.,"came,' he will say, 'across the border, very proud, calling upon us"
4000,THE LOST LEGION.,"to rise and kill the English, and go down to the sack of Delhi. But"
4001,THE LOST LEGION.,we who had just been conquered by the same English knew that they
4002,THE LOST LEGION.,"were over bold, and that the Government could account easily for"
4003,THE LOST LEGION.,"those down-country dogs. This Hindu stani regiment, therefore, we"
4004,THE LOST LEGION.,"treated with fair words, and kept standing in one place till the"
4005,THE LOST LEGION.,redcoats came after them very hot and angry. Then this regiment ran
4006,THE LOST LEGION.,forward a little more into our hills to avoid the wrath of the
4007,THE LOST LEGION.,"English, and we lay upon their flanks watching from the sides of the"
4008,THE LOST LEGION.,hills till we were well assured that their path was lost behind them.
4009,THE LOST LEGION.,"Then we came down, for we desired their clothes, and their bridles,"
4010,THE LOST LEGION.,"and their rifles, and their boots--more especially their boots. That"
4011,THE LOST LEGION.,was a great killing--done slowly.' Here the old man will rub his
4012,THE LOST LEGION.,"nose, and shake his long snaky locks, and lick his bearded lips, and"
4013,THE LOST LEGION.,"grin till the yellow tooth-stumps show. 'Yes, we killed them because"
4014,THE LOST LEGION.,"we needed their gear, and we knew that their lives had been forfeited"
4015,THE LOST LEGION.,to God on account of their sin--the sin of treachery to the salt
4016,THE LOST LEGION.,"which they had eaten. They rode up and down the valleys, stumbling"
4017,THE LOST LEGION.,"and rocking in their saddles, and howling for mercy. We drove them"
4018,THE LOST LEGION.,"slowly like cattle till they were all assembled in one place, the"
4019,THE LOST LEGION.,"flat wide valley of Sheor Kôt. Many had died from want of water, but"
4020,THE LOST LEGION.,"there still were many left, and they could not make any stand. We"
4021,THE LOST LEGION.,"went among them, pulling them down with our hands two at a time, and"
4022,THE LOST LEGION.,our boys killed them who were new to the sword. My share of the
4023,THE LOST LEGION.,"plunder was such and such--so many guns, and so many saddles. The"
4024,THE LOST LEGION.,"guns were good in those days. Now we steal the Government rifles,"
4025,THE LOST LEGION.,"and despise smooth barrels. Yes, beyond doubt we wiped that"
4026,THE LOST LEGION.,"regiment from off the face of the earth, and even the memory of the"
4027,THE LOST LEGION.,deed is now dying. But men say----'
4028,THE LOST LEGION.,
4029,THE LOST LEGION.,"At this point the tale would stop abruptly, and it was impossible to"
4030,THE LOST LEGION.,find out what men said across the border. The Afghans were always a
4031,THE LOST LEGION.,"secretive race, and vastly preferred doing something wicked to saying"
4032,THE LOST LEGION.,"anything at all. They would be quiet and well-behaved for months,"
4033,THE LOST LEGION.,"till one night, without word or warning, they would rush a"
4034,THE LOST LEGION.,"police-post, cut the throats of a constable or two, dash through a"
4035,THE LOST LEGION.,"village, carry away three or four women, and withdraw, in the red"
4036,THE LOST LEGION.,"glare of burning thatch, driving the cattle and goats before them to"
4037,THE LOST LEGION.,their own desolate hills. The Indian Government would become almost
4038,THE LOST LEGION.,"tearful on these occasions. First it would say, 'Please be good and"
4039,THE LOST LEGION.,we'll forgive you.' The tribe concerned in the latest depredation
4040,THE LOST LEGION.,would collectively put its thumb to its nose and answer rudely. Then
4041,THE LOST LEGION.,the Government would say: 'Hadn't you better pay up a little money
4042,THE LOST LEGION.,for those few corpses you left behind you the other night?' Here the
4043,THE LOST LEGION.,"tribe would temporise, and lie and bully, and some of the younger"
4044,THE LOST LEGION.,"men, merely to show contempt of authority, would raid another"
4045,THE LOST LEGION.,"police-post and fire into some frontier mud fort, and, if lucky, kill"
4046,THE LOST LEGION.,a real English officer. Then the Government would say: 'Observe; if
4047,THE LOST LEGION.,you really persist in this line of conduct you will be hurt.' If the
4048,THE LOST LEGION.,"tribe knew exactly what was going on in India, it would apologise or"
4049,THE LOST LEGION.,"be rude, according as it learned whether the Government was busy with"
4050,THE LOST LEGION.,"other things, or able to devote its full attention to their"
4051,THE LOST LEGION.,performances. Some of the tribes knew to one corpse how far to go.
4052,THE LOST LEGION.,"Others became excited, lost their heads, and told the Government to"
4053,THE LOST LEGION.,"come on. With sorrow and tears, and one eye on the British taxpayer"
4054,THE LOST LEGION.,"at home, who insisted on regarding these exercises as brutal wars of"
4055,THE LOST LEGION.,"annexation, the Government would prepare an expensive little"
4056,THE LOST LEGION.,"field-brigade and some guns, and send all up into the hills to chase"
4057,THE LOST LEGION.,"the wicked tribe out of the valleys, where the corn grew, into the"
4058,THE LOST LEGION.,hill-tops where there was nothing to eat. The tribe would turn out in
4059,THE LOST LEGION.,"full strength and enjoy the campaign, for they knew that their women"
4060,THE LOST LEGION.,"would never be touched, that their wounded would be nursed, not"
4061,THE LOST LEGION.,"mutilated, and that as soon as each man's bag of corn was spent they"
4062,THE LOST LEGION.,could surrender and palaver with the English General as though they
4063,THE LOST LEGION.,"had been a real enemy. Afterwards, years afterwards, they would pay"
4064,THE LOST LEGION.,"the blood-money, driblet by driblet, to the Government and tell their"
4065,THE LOST LEGION.,children how they had slain the redcoats by thousands. The only
4066,THE LOST LEGION.,drawback to this kind of picnic-war was the weakness of the redcoats
4067,THE LOST LEGION.,for solemnly blowing up with powder their fortified towers and keeps.
4068,THE LOST LEGION.,This the tribes always considered mean.
4069,THE LOST LEGION.,
4070,THE LOST LEGION.,Chief among the leaders of the smaller tribes--the little clans who
4071,THE LOST LEGION.,knew to a penny the expense of moving white troops against them--was
4072,THE LOST LEGION.,a priest-bandit-chief whom we will call the Gulla Kutta Mullah. His
4073,THE LOST LEGION.,enthusiasm for border murder as an art was almost dignified. He
4074,THE LOST LEGION.,"would cut down a mail-runner from pure wantonness, or bombard a mud"
4075,THE LOST LEGION.,fort with rifle fire when he knew that our men needed to sleep. In
4076,THE LOST LEGION.,"his leisure moments he would go on circuit among his neighbours, and"
4077,THE LOST LEGION.,"try to incite other tribes to devilry. Also, he kept a kind of hotel"
4078,THE LOST LEGION.,"for fellow-outlaws in his own village, which lay in a valley called"
4079,THE LOST LEGION.,Bersund. Any respectable murderer on that section of the frontier was
4080,THE LOST LEGION.,"sure to lie up at Bersund, for it was reckoned an exceedingly safe"
4081,THE LOST LEGION.,place. The sole entry to it ran through a narrow gorge which could be
4082,THE LOST LEGION.,converted into a death-trap in five minutes. It was surrounded by
4083,THE LOST LEGION.,"high hills, reckoned inaccessible to all save born mountaineers, and"
4084,THE LOST LEGION.,"here the Gulla Kutta Mullah lived in great state, the head of a"
4085,THE LOST LEGION.,"colony of mud and stone huts, and in each mud hut hung Some portion"
4086,THE LOST LEGION.,of a red uniform and the plunder of dead men. The Government
4087,THE LOST LEGION.,"particularly wished for his capture, and once invited him formally to"
4088,THE LOST LEGION.,come out and be hanged on account of a few of the murders in which he
4089,THE LOST LEGION.,had taken a direct part. He replied:--
4090,THE LOST LEGION.,
4091,THE LOST LEGION.,"'I am only twenty miles, as the crow flies, from your border. Come"
4092,THE LOST LEGION.,and fetch me.'
4093,THE LOST LEGION.,
4094,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Some day we will come,' said the Government, 'and hanged you will"
4095,THE LOST LEGION.,be.'
4096,THE LOST LEGION.,
4097,THE LOST LEGION.,The Gulla Kutta Mullah let the matter from his mind. He knew that the
4098,THE LOST LEGION.,patience of the Government was as long as a summer day; but he did
4099,THE LOST LEGION.,not realise that its arm was as long as a winter night. Months
4100,THE LOST LEGION.,"afterwards when there was peace on the border, and all India was"
4101,THE LOST LEGION.,"quiet, the Indian Government turned in its sleep and remembered the"
4102,THE LOST LEGION.,"Gulla Kutta Mullah at Bersund, with his thirteen outlaws. The"
4103,THE LOST LEGION.,movement against him of one single regiment--which the telegrams
4104,THE LOST LEGION.,would have translated as war--would have been highly impolitic. This
4105,THE LOST LEGION.,"was a time for silence and speed, and, above all, absence of"
4106,THE LOST LEGION.,bloodshed.
4107,THE LOST LEGION.,
4108,THE LOST LEGION.,You must know that all along the north-west frontier of India there
4109,THE LOST LEGION.,"is spread a force of some thirty thousand foot and horse, whose duty"
4110,THE LOST LEGION.,it is quietly and unostentatiously to shepherd the tribes in front of
4111,THE LOST LEGION.,"them. They move up and down, and down and up, from one desolate"
4112,THE LOST LEGION.,little post to another; they are ready to take the field at ten
4113,THE LOST LEGION.,minutes' notice; they are always half in and half out of a difficulty
4114,THE LOST LEGION.,somewhere along the monotonous line; their lives are as hard as their
4115,THE LOST LEGION.,"own muscles, and the papers never say anything about them. It was"
4116,THE LOST LEGION.,from this force that the Government picked its men.
4117,THE LOST LEGION.,
4118,THE LOST LEGION.,One night at a station where the mounted Night Patrol fire as they
4119,THE LOST LEGION.,"challenge, and the wheat rolls in great blue green waves under our"
4120,THE LOST LEGION.,"cold northern moon, the officers were playing billiards in the"
4121,THE LOST LEGION.,"mud-walled club-house, when orders came to them that they were to go"
4122,THE LOST LEGION.,"on parade at once for a night-drill. They grumbled, and went to turn"
4123,THE LOST LEGION.,"out their men--a hundred English troops, let us say, two hundred"
4124,THE LOST LEGION.,"Goorkhas, and about a hundred cavalry of the finest native cavalry in"
4125,THE LOST LEGION.,the world.
4126,THE LOST LEGION.,
4127,THE LOST LEGION.,"When they were on the parade-ground, it was explained to them in"
4128,THE LOST LEGION.,whispers that they must set off at once across the hills to Bersund.
4129,THE LOST LEGION.,The English troops were to post themselves round the hills at the
4130,THE LOST LEGION.,side of the valley; the Goorkhas would command the gorge and the
4131,THE LOST LEGION.,"death-trap, and the cavalry would fetch a long march round and get to"
4132,THE LOST LEGION.,"the back of the circle of hills, whence, if there were any"
4133,THE LOST LEGION.,"difficulty, they could charge down on the Mullah's men. But orders"
4134,THE LOST LEGION.,were very strict that there should be no fighting and no noise. They
4135,THE LOST LEGION.,"were to return in the morning with every round of ammunition intact,"
4136,THE LOST LEGION.,and the Mullah and the thirteen outlaws bound in their midst. If they
4137,THE LOST LEGION.,"were successful, no one would know or care anything about their work;"
4138,THE LOST LEGION.,"but failure meant probably a small border war, in which the Gulla"
4139,THE LOST LEGION.,Kutta Mullah would pose as a popular leader against a big bullying
4140,THE LOST LEGION.,"power, instead of a common border murderer."
4141,THE LOST LEGION.,
4142,THE LOST LEGION.,"Then there was silence, broken only by the clicking of the compass"
4143,THE LOST LEGION.,"needles and snapping of watch-cases, as the heads of columns compared"
4144,THE LOST LEGION.,bearings and made appointments for the rendezvous. Five minutes later
4145,THE LOST LEGION.,the parade-ground was empty; the green coats of the Goorkhas and the
4146,THE LOST LEGION.,"overcoats of the English troops had faded into the darkness, and the"
4147,THE LOST LEGION.,cavalry were cantering away in the face of a blinding drizzle.
4148,THE LOST LEGION.,
4149,THE LOST LEGION.,What the Goorkhas and the English did will be seen later on. The heavy
4150,THE LOST LEGION.,"work lay with the horses, for they had to go far and pick their way"
4151,THE LOST LEGION.,clear of habitations. Many of the troopers were natives of that part
4152,THE LOST LEGION.,"of the world, ready and anxious to fight against their kin, and some"
4153,THE LOST LEGION.,of the officers had made private and unofficial excursions into those
4154,THE LOST LEGION.,"hills before. They crossed the border, found a dried river bed,"
4155,THE LOST LEGION.,"cantered up that, waited through a stony gorge, risked crossing a low"
4156,THE LOST LEGION.,"hill under cover of the darkness, skirted another hill, leaving their"
4157,THE LOST LEGION.,"hoof-marks deep in some ploughed ground, felt their way along another"
4158,THE LOST LEGION.,"watercourse, ran over the neck of a spur, praying that no one would"
4159,THE LOST LEGION.,"hear their horses grunting, and so worked on in the rain and the"
4160,THE LOST LEGION.,"darkness, till they had left Bersund and its crater of hills a little"
4161,THE LOST LEGION.,"behind them, and to the left, and it was time to swing round."
4162,THE LOST LEGION.,"The ascent commanding the back of Bersund was steep, and they halted"
4163,THE LOST LEGION.,to draw breath in a broad level valley below the height. That is to
4164,THE LOST LEGION.,"say, the men reined up, but the horses, blown as they were, refused"
4165,THE LOST LEGION.,"to halt. There was unchristian language, the worse for being"
4166,THE LOST LEGION.,"delivered in a whisper, and you heard the saddles squeaking in the"
4167,THE LOST LEGION.,darkness as the horses plunged.
4168,THE LOST LEGION.,
4169,THE LOST LEGION.,The subaltern at the rear of one troop turned in his saddle and said
4170,THE LOST LEGION.,very softly:--
4171,THE LOST LEGION.,
4172,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Carter, what the blessed heavens are you doing at the rear? Bring"
4173,THE LOST LEGION.,"your men up, man.'"
4174,THE LOST LEGION.,
4175,THE LOST LEGION.,"There was no answer, till a trooper replied:--"
4176,THE LOST LEGION.,
4177,THE LOST LEGION.,'Carter Sahib is forward--not there. There is nothing behind us.'
4178,THE LOST LEGION.,
4179,THE LOST LEGION.,"'There is,' said the subaltern. 'The squadron's walking on it's own"
4180,THE LOST LEGION.,tail.'
4181,THE LOST LEGION.,
4182,THE LOST LEGION.,Then the Major in command moved down to the rear swearing softly and
4183,THE LOST LEGION.,asking for the blood of Lieutenant Halley--the subaltern who had just
4184,THE LOST LEGION.,spoken.
4185,THE LOST LEGION.,
4186,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Look after your rearguard,' said the Major. 'Some of your infernal"
4187,THE LOST LEGION.,"thieves have got lost. They're at the head of the squadron, and"
4188,THE LOST LEGION.,you're a several kinds of idiot.'
4189,THE LOST LEGION.,
4190,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Shall I tell off my men, sir?' said the subaltern sulkily, for he"
4191,THE LOST LEGION.,was feeling wet and cold.
4192,THE LOST LEGION.,
4193,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Tell 'em off!' said the Major. '_Whip_ 'em off, by Gad! You're"
4194,THE LOST LEGION.,squandering them all over the place. There's a troop behind you
4195,THE LOST LEGION.,_now_!'
4196,THE LOST LEGION.,
4197,THE LOST LEGION.,"'So I was thinking,' said the subaltern calmly. 'I have all my men"
4198,THE LOST LEGION.,"here, sir. Better speak to Carter.'"
4199,THE LOST LEGION.,
4200,THE LOST LEGION.,'Carter Sahib sends salaam and wants to know why the regiment is
4201,THE LOST LEGION.,"stopping,' said a trooper to Lieutenant Halley."
4202,THE LOST LEGION.,
4203,THE LOST LEGION.,'Where under heaven _is_ Carter?' said the Major.
4204,THE LOST LEGION.,
4205,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Forward with his troop,' was the answer."
4206,THE LOST LEGION.,
4207,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Are we walking in a ring, then, or are we the centre of a blessed"
4208,THE LOST LEGION.,brigade?' said the Major.
4209,THE LOST LEGION.,
4210,THE LOST LEGION.,By this time there was silence all along the column. The horses were
4211,THE LOST LEGION.,"still; but, through the drive of the fine rain, men could hear the"
4212,THE LOST LEGION.,feet of many horses moving over stony ground.
4213,THE LOST LEGION.,
4214,THE LOST LEGION.,"'We're being stalked,' said Lieutenant Halley."
4215,THE LOST LEGION.,
4216,THE LOST LEGION.,"'They've no horses here. Besides they'd have fired before this,' said"
4217,THE LOST LEGION.,the Major. 'It's--it's villagers' ponies.'
4218,THE LOST LEGION.,
4219,THE LOST LEGION.,'Then our horses would have neighed and spoilt the attack long ago.
4220,THE LOST LEGION.,"They must have been near us for half an hour,' said the subaltern."
4221,THE LOST LEGION.,
4222,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Queer that we can't smell the horses,' said the Major, damping his"
4223,THE LOST LEGION.,finger and rubbing it on his nose as he sniffed up wind.
4224,THE LOST LEGION.,
4225,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Well, it's a bad start,' said the subaltern, shaking the wet from"
4226,THE LOST LEGION.,"his overcoat. 'What shall we do, sir?'"
4227,THE LOST LEGION.,
4228,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Get on,' said the Major. 'We shall catch it to-night.'"
4229,THE LOST LEGION.,
4230,THE LOST LEGION.,The column moved forward very gingerly for a few paces. Then there
4231,THE LOST LEGION.,"was an oath, a shower of blue sparks as shod hooves crashed on small"
4232,THE LOST LEGION.,"stones, and a man rolled over with a jangle of accoutrements that"
4233,THE LOST LEGION.,would have waked the dead.
4234,THE LOST LEGION.,
4235,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Now we've gone and done it,' said Lieutenant Halley. 'All the"
4236,THE LOST LEGION.,"hillside awake, and all the hillside to climb in the face of"
4237,THE LOST LEGION.,musketry-fire. This comes of trying to do night-hawk work.'
4238,THE LOST LEGION.,
4239,THE LOST LEGION.,"The trembling trooper picked himself up, and tried to explain that"
4240,THE LOST LEGION.,his horse had fallen over one of the little cairns that are built of
4241,THE LOST LEGION.,loose stones on the spot where a man has been murdered. There was no
4242,THE LOST LEGION.,"need for reasons. The Major's big Australian charger blundered next,"
4243,THE LOST LEGION.,and the column came to a halt in what seemed to be a very graveyard
4244,THE LOST LEGION.,of little cairns all about two feet high. The man[oe]uvres of the
4245,THE LOST LEGION.,squadron are not reported. Men said that it felt like mounted
4246,THE LOST LEGION.,quadrilles without training and without the music; but at last the
4247,THE LOST LEGION.,"horses, breaking rank and choosing their own way, walked clear of"
4248,THE LOST LEGION.,"the cairns, till every man of the squadron re-formed and drew rein a"
4249,THE LOST LEGION.,"few yards up the slope of the hill. Then, according to Lieutenant"
4250,THE LOST LEGION.,"Halley, there was another scene very like the one which has been"
4251,THE LOST LEGION.,described. The Major and Carter insisted that all the men had not
4252,THE LOST LEGION.,"joined rank, and that there were more of them in the rear clicking"
4253,THE LOST LEGION.,and blundering among the dead men's cairns. Lieutenant Halley told
4254,THE LOST LEGION.,off his own troopers again and resigned himself to wait. Later on he
4255,THE LOST LEGION.,told me:--
4256,THE LOST LEGION.,
4257,THE LOST LEGION.,"'I didn't much know, and I didn't much care what was going on. The"
4258,THE LOST LEGION.,"row of that trooper falling ought to have scared half the country,"
4259,THE LOST LEGION.,and I would take my oath that we were being stalked by a full
4260,THE LOST LEGION.,"regiment in the rear, and _they_ were making row enough to rouse all"
4261,THE LOST LEGION.,"Afghanistan. I sat tight, but nothing happened.'"
4262,THE LOST LEGION.,
4263,THE LOST LEGION.,The mysterious part of the night's work was the silence on the
4264,THE LOST LEGION.,hillside. Everybody knew that the Gulla Kutta Mullah had his outpost
4265,THE LOST LEGION.,"huts on the reverse side of the hill, and everybody expected by the"
4266,THE LOST LEGION.,time that the Major had sworn himself into a state of quiet that the
4267,THE LOST LEGION.,"watchmen there would open fire. When nothing occurred, they said that"
4268,THE LOST LEGION.,"the gusts of the rain had deadened the sound of the horses, and"
4269,THE LOST LEGION.,thanked Providence. At last the Major satisfied himself (a) that he
4270,THE LOST LEGION.,"had left no one behind among the cairns, and (b) that he was not"
4271,THE LOST LEGION.,being taken in the rear by a large and powerful body of cavalry. The
4272,THE LOST LEGION.,"men's tempers were thoroughly spoiled, the horses were lathered and"
4273,THE LOST LEGION.,"unquiet, and one and all prayed for the daylight."
4274,THE LOST LEGION.,
4275,THE LOST LEGION.,"They set themselves to climb up the hill, each man leading his mount"
4276,THE LOST LEGION.,carefully. Before they had covered the lower slopes or the
4277,THE LOST LEGION.,"breastplates had begun to tighten, a thunderstorm came up behind,"
4278,THE LOST LEGION.,rolling across the low hills and drowning any noise less than that of
4279,THE LOST LEGION.,cannon. The first flash of the lightning showed the bare ribs of the
4280,THE LOST LEGION.,"ascent, the hill-crest standing steely blue against the black sky,"
4281,THE LOST LEGION.,"the little falling lines of the rain, and, a few yards to their left"
4282,THE LOST LEGION.,"flank, an Afghan watch-tower, two-storied, built of stone, and"
4283,THE LOST LEGION.,"entered by a ladder from the upper story. The ladder was up, and a"
4284,THE LOST LEGION.,man with a rifle was leaning from the window. The darkness and the
4285,THE LOST LEGION.,"thunder rolled down in an instant, and, when the lull followed, a"
4286,THE LOST LEGION.,"voice from the watch-tower cried, 'Who goes there?'"
4287,THE LOST LEGION.,
4288,THE LOST LEGION.,"The cavalry were very quiet, but each man gripped his carbine and"
4289,THE LOST LEGION.,"stood beside his horse. Again the voice called, 'Who goes there?'"
4290,THE LOST LEGION.,"and in a louder key, 'O, brothers, give the alarm!' Now, every man in"
4291,THE LOST LEGION.,the cavalry would have died in his long boots sooner than have asked
4292,THE LOST LEGION.,for quarter; but it is a fact that the answer to the second call was
4293,THE LOST LEGION.,"a long wail of 'Marf karo! Marf karo!' which means, 'Have mercy! Have"
4294,THE LOST LEGION.,mercy!' It came from the climbing regiment.
4295,THE LOST LEGION.,
4296,THE LOST LEGION.,"The cavalry stood dumbfoundered, till the big troopers had time to"
4297,THE LOST LEGION.,"whisper one to another: 'Mir Khan, was that thy voice? Abdullah,"
4298,THE LOST LEGION.,didst _thou_ call?' Lieutenant Halley stood beside his charger and
4299,THE LOST LEGION.,waited. So long as no firing was going on he was content. Another
4300,THE LOST LEGION.,flash of lightning showed the horses with heaving flanks and nodding
4301,THE LOST LEGION.,"heads, the men, white eye-balled, glaring beside them and the stone"
4302,THE LOST LEGION.,"watch-tower to the left. This time there was no head at the window,"
4303,THE LOST LEGION.,and the rude iron-clamped shutter that could turn a rifle bullet was
4304,THE LOST LEGION.,closed.
4305,THE LOST LEGION.,
4306,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Go on, men,' said the Major. 'Get up to the top at any rate.' The"
4307,THE LOST LEGION.,"squadron toiled forward, the horses wagging their tails and the men"
4308,THE LOST LEGION.,"pulling at the bridles, the stones rolling down the hillside and the"
4309,THE LOST LEGION.,sparks flying. Lieutenant Halley declares that he never heard a
4310,THE LOST LEGION.,"squadron make so much noise in his life. They scrambled up, he said,"
4311,THE LOST LEGION.,as though each horse had eight legs and a spare horse to follow him.
4312,THE LOST LEGION.,"Even then there was no sound from the watch-tower, and the men"
4313,THE LOST LEGION.,stopped exhausted on the ridge that overlooked the pit of darkness in
4314,THE LOST LEGION.,"which the village of Bersund lay. Girths were loosed, curb-chains"
4315,THE LOST LEGION.,"shifted, and saddles adjusted, and the men dropped down among the"
4316,THE LOST LEGION.,"stones. Whatever might happen now, they had the upper ground of any"
4317,THE LOST LEGION.,attack.
4318,THE LOST LEGION.,
4319,THE LOST LEGION.,"The thunder ceased, and with it the rain, and the soft thick darkness"
4320,THE LOST LEGION.,of a winter night before the dawn covered them all. Except for the
4321,THE LOST LEGION.,"sound of falling water among the ravines below, everything was still."
4322,THE LOST LEGION.,They heard the shutter of the watch-tower below them thrown back with
4323,THE LOST LEGION.,"a clang, and the voice of the watcher calling: 'Oh, Hafiz Ullah!'"
4324,THE LOST LEGION.,
4325,THE LOST LEGION.,"The echoes took up the call, 'La-la-la!' And an answer came from the"
4326,THE LOST LEGION.,"watch-tower hidden round the curve of the hill, 'What is it, Shahbaz"
4327,THE LOST LEGION.,Khan?'
4328,THE LOST LEGION.,
4329,THE LOST LEGION.,Shahbaz Khan replied in the high-pitched voice of the mountaineer:
4330,THE LOST LEGION.,'Hast thou seen?'
4331,THE LOST LEGION.,
4332,THE LOST LEGION.,The answer came back: 'Yes. God deliver us from all evil spirits!'
4333,THE LOST LEGION.,
4334,THE LOST LEGION.,"There was a pause, and then: 'Hafiz Ullah, I am alone! Come to me!'"
4335,THE LOST LEGION.,
4336,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Shahbaz Khan, I am alone also; but I dare not leave my post!'"
4337,THE LOST LEGION.,
4338,THE LOST LEGION.,'That is a lie; thou art afraid.'
4339,THE LOST LEGION.,
4340,THE LOST LEGION.,"A longer pause followed, and then: 'I am afraid. Be silent! They are"
4341,THE LOST LEGION.,below us still. Pray to God and sleep.'
4342,THE LOST LEGION.,
4343,THE LOST LEGION.,"The troopers listened and wondered, for they could not understand"
4344,THE LOST LEGION.,what save earth and stone could lie below the watch-towers.
4345,THE LOST LEGION.,
4346,THE LOST LEGION.,Shahbaz Khan began to call again: 'They are below us. I can see them.
4347,THE LOST LEGION.,"For the pity of God come over to me, Hafiz Ullah! My father slew ten"
4348,THE LOST LEGION.,of them. Come over!'
4349,THE LOST LEGION.,
4350,THE LOST LEGION.,"Hafiz Ullah answered in a very loud voice, 'Mine was guiltless. Hear,"
4351,THE LOST LEGION.,"ye Men of the Night, neither my father nor my blood had any part in"
4352,THE LOST LEGION.,"that sin. Bear thou thy own punishment, Shahbaz Khan.'"
4353,THE LOST LEGION.,
4354,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Oh, some one ought to stop those two chaps crowing away like cocks"
4355,THE LOST LEGION.,"there,' said Lieutenant Halley, shivering under his rock."
4356,THE LOST LEGION.,
4357,THE LOST LEGION.,He had hardly turned round to expose a new side of him to the rain
4358,THE LOST LEGION.,"before a bearded, long-locked, evil-smelling Afghan rushed up the"
4359,THE LOST LEGION.,"hill, and tumbled into his arms. Halley sat upon him, and thrust as"
4360,THE LOST LEGION.,much of a sword-hilt as could be spared down the man's gullet. 'If
4361,THE LOST LEGION.,"you cry out, I kill you,' he said cheerfully."
4362,THE LOST LEGION.,
4363,THE LOST LEGION.,"The man was beyond any expression of terror. He lay and quaked,"
4364,THE LOST LEGION.,"grunting. When Halley took the sword-hilt from between his teeth, he"
4365,THE LOST LEGION.,"was still inarticulate, but clung to Halley's arm, feeling it from"
4366,THE LOST LEGION.,elbow to wrist.
4367,THE LOST LEGION.,
4368,THE LOST LEGION.,'The Rissala! The dead Rissala!' he gasped. 'It is down there!'
4369,THE LOST LEGION.,
4370,THE LOST LEGION.,"'No; the Rissala, the very much alive Rissala. It is up here,' said"
4371,THE LOST LEGION.,"Halley, unshipping his watering-bridle, and fastening the man's"
4372,THE LOST LEGION.,hands. 'Why were you in the towers so foolish as to let us pass?'
4373,THE LOST LEGION.,
4374,THE LOST LEGION.,"'The valley is full of the dead,' said the Afghan. 'It is better to"
4375,THE LOST LEGION.,fall into the hands of the English than the hands of the dead. They
4376,THE LOST LEGION.,march to and fro below there. I saw them in the lightning.'
4377,THE LOST LEGION.,
4378,THE LOST LEGION.,"He recovered his composure after a little, and whispering, because"
4379,THE LOST LEGION.,"Halley's pistol was at his stomach, said: 'What is this? There is no"
4380,THE LOST LEGION.,"war between us now, and the Mullah will kill me for not seeing you"
4381,THE LOST LEGION.,pass!'
4382,THE LOST LEGION.,
4383,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Rest easy,' said Halley; 'we are coming to kill the Mullah, if God"
4384,THE LOST LEGION.,please. His teeth have grown too long. No harm will come to thee
4385,THE LOST LEGION.,unless the daylight shows thee as a face which is desired by the
4386,THE LOST LEGION.,gallows for crime done. But what of the dead regiment?'
4387,THE LOST LEGION.,
4388,THE LOST LEGION.,"'I only kill within my own border,' said the man, immensely relieved."
4389,THE LOST LEGION.,'The Dead Regiment is below. The men must have passed through it on
4390,THE LOST LEGION.,"their journey--four hundred dead on horses, stumbling among their own"
4391,THE LOST LEGION.,"graves, among the little heaps--dead men all, whom we slew.'"
4392,THE LOST LEGION.,
4393,THE LOST LEGION.,'Whew!' said Halley. 'That accounts for my cursing Carter and the
4394,THE LOST LEGION.,"Major cursing me. Four hundred sabres, eh? No wonder we thought there"
4395,THE LOST LEGION.,"were a few extra men in the troop. Kurruk Shah,' he whispered to a"
4396,THE LOST LEGION.,"grizzled native officer that lay within a few feet of him, 'hast thou"
4397,THE LOST LEGION.,heard anything of a dead Rissala in these hills?'
4398,THE LOST LEGION.,
4399,THE LOST LEGION.,"'Assuredly,' said Kurruk Shah with a grim chuckle. 'Otherwise, why"
4400,THE LOST LEGION.,"did I, who have served the Queen for seven-and-twenty years, and"
4401,THE LOST LEGION.,"killed many hill-dogs, shout aloud for quarter when the lightning"
4402,THE LOST LEGION.,revealed us to the watch-towers? When I was a young man I saw the
4403,THE LOST LEGION.,"killing in the valley of Sheor-Kot there at our feet, and I know the"
4404,THE LOST LEGION.,tale that grew up therefrom. But how can the ghosts of unbelievers
4405,THE LOST LEGION.,prevail against us who are of the Faith? Strap that dog's hands a
4406,THE LOST LEGION.,"little tighter, Sahib. An Afghan is like an eel.'"
4407,THE LOST LEGION.,
4408,THE LOST LEGION.,"'But a dead Rissala,' said Halley, jerking his captive's wrist. 'That"
4409,THE LOST LEGION.,"is foolish talk, Kurruk Shah. The dead are dead. Hold still, _sag_.'"
4410,THE LOST LEGION.,The Afghan wriggled.
4411,THE LOST LEGION.,
4412,THE LOST LEGION.,"'The dead are dead, and for that reason they walk at night. What need"
4413,THE LOST LEGION.,to talk? We be men; we have our eyes and ears. Thou canst both see
4414,THE LOST LEGION.,"and hear them, down the hillside,' said Kurruk Shah composedly."
4415,THE LOST LEGION.,
4416,THE LOST LEGION.,Halley stared and listened long and intently. The valley was full of
4417,THE LOST LEGION.,"stifled noises, as every valley must be at night; but whether he saw"
4418,THE LOST LEGION.,"or heard more than was natural Halley alone knows, and he does not"
4419,THE LOST LEGION.,choose to speak on the subject.
4420,THE LOST LEGION.,
4421,THE LOST LEGION.,"At last, and just before the dawn, a green rocket shot up from the"
4422,THE LOST LEGION.,"far side of the valley of Bersund, at the head of the gorge, to show"
4423,THE LOST LEGION.,that the Goorkhas were in position. A red light from the infantry at
4424,THE LOST LEGION.,"left and right answered it, and the cavalry burnt a white flare."
4425,THE LOST LEGION.,"Afghans in winter are late sleepers, and it was not till full day"
4426,THE LOST LEGION.,"that the Gulla Kutta Mullah's men began to straggle from their huts,"
4427,THE LOST LEGION.,"rubbing their eyes. They saw men in green, and red, and brown"
4428,THE LOST LEGION.,"uniforms, leaning on their arms, neatly arranged all round the crater"
4429,THE LOST LEGION.,"of the village of Bersund, in a cordon that not even a wolf could"
4430,THE LOST LEGION.,have broken. They rubbed their eyes the more when a pink-faced young
4431,THE LOST LEGION.,"man, who was not even in the Army, but represented the Political"
4432,THE LOST LEGION.,"Department, tripped down the hillside with two orderlies, rapped at"
4433,THE LOST LEGION.,"the door of the Gulla Kutta Mullah's house, and told  him quietly to"
4434,THE LOST LEGION.,step out and be tied up for safe transport. That same young man
4435,THE LOST LEGION.,"passed on through the huts, tapping here one cateran and there"
4436,THE LOST LEGION.,"another lightly with his cane; and as each was pointed out, so he was"
4437,THE LOST LEGION.,"tied up, staring hopelessly at the crowned heights around where the"
4438,THE LOST LEGION.,English soldiers looked down with incurious eyes. Only the Mullah
4439,THE LOST LEGION.,"tried to carry it off with curses and high words, till a soldier who"
4440,THE LOST LEGION.,was tying his hands said:--
4441,THE LOST LEGION.,
4442,THE LOST LEGION.,"'None o' your lip! Why didn't you come out when you was ordered,"
4443,THE LOST LEGION.,instead o' keepin' us awake all night? You're no better than my own
4444,THE LOST LEGION.,"barrack-sweeper, you white-'eaded old polyanthus! Kim up!'"
4445,THE LOST LEGION.,
4446,THE LOST LEGION.,Half an hour later the troops had gone away with the Mullah and his
4447,THE LOST LEGION.,thirteen friends. The dazed villagers were looking ruefully at a pile
4448,THE LOST LEGION.,"of broken muskets and snapped swords, and wondering how in the world"
4449,THE LOST LEGION.,they had come so to miscalculate the forbearance of the Indian
4450,THE LOST LEGION.,Government.
4451,THE LOST LEGION.,
4452,THE LOST LEGION.,"It was a very neat little affair, neatly carried out, and the men"
4453,THE LOST LEGION.,concerned were unofficially thanked for their services.
4454,THE LOST LEGION.,
4455,THE LOST LEGION.,Yet it seems to me that much credit is also due to another regiment
4456,THE LOST LEGION.,"whose name did not appear in the brigade orders, and whose very"
4457,THE LOST LEGION.,existence is in danger of being forgotten.
4458,THE LOST LEGION.,
4459,THE LOST LEGION.,
4460,THE LOST LEGION.,
4461,THE LOST LEGION.,
4462,NAMGAY DOOLA.,NAMGAY DOOLA.
4463,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4464,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,"
4465,NAMGAY DOOLA.,The dew on his wet robe hung heavy and chill;
4466,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Ere the steamer that brought him had passed out of hearin',"
4467,NAMGAY DOOLA.,He was Alderman Mike inthrojuicing' a bill!
4468,NAMGAY DOOLA.,_American Song_.
4469,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4470,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Once upon a time there was a King who lived on the road to Thibet,"
4471,NAMGAY DOOLA.,very many miles in the Himalayas. His Kingdom was eleven thousand
4472,NAMGAY DOOLA.,feet above the sea and exactly four miles square; but most of the
4473,NAMGAY DOOLA.,miles stood on end owing to the nature of the country. His revenues
4474,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"were rather less than four hundred pounds yearly, and they were"
4475,NAMGAY DOOLA.,expended in the maintenance of one elephant and a standing army of
4476,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"five men. He was tributary to the Indian Government, who allowed him"
4477,NAMGAY DOOLA.,certain sums for keeping a section of the Himalaya-Thibet road in
4478,NAMGAY DOOLA.,repair. He further increased his revenues by selling timber to the
4479,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Railway companies; for he would cut the great deodar trees in his one
4480,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"forest, and they fell thundering into the Sutlej river and were swept"
4481,NAMGAY DOOLA.,down to the plains three hundred miles away and became railway-ties.
4482,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Now and again this King, whose name does not matter, would mount a"
4483,NAMGAY DOOLA.,ringstraked horse and ride scores of miles to Simla-town to confer
4484,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"with the Lieutenant-Governor on matters of state, or to assure the"
4485,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Viceroy that his sword was at the service of the Queen-Empress. Then
4486,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"the Viceroy would cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded, and the"
4487,NAMGAY DOOLA.,ringstraked horse and the cavalry of the State--two men in
4488,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"tatters--and the herald who bore the silver stick before the King,"
4489,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"would trot back to their own place, which lay between the tail of a"
4490,NAMGAY DOOLA.,heaven-climbing glacier and a dark birch-forest.
4491,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4492,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Now, from such a King, always remembering that he possessed one"
4493,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"veritable elephant, and could count his descent for twelve hundred"
4494,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"years, I expected, when it was my fate to wander through his"
4495,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"dominions, no more than mere license to live."
4496,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4497,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"The night had closed in rain, and rolling clouds blotted out the"
4498,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"lights of the villages in the valley. Forty miles away, untouched by"
4499,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"cloud or storm, the white shoulder of Donga Pa--the Mountain of the"
4500,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Council of the Gods--upheld the Evening Star. The monkeys sang
4501,NAMGAY DOOLA.,sorrowfully to each other as they hunted for dry roosts in the
4502,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"fern-wreathed trees, and the last puff of the day-wind brought from"
4503,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"the unseen villages the scent of damp wood-smoke, hot cakes, dripping"
4504,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"undergrowth, and rotting pine-cones. That is the true smell of the"
4505,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Himalayas, and if once it creeps into the blood of a man, that man"
4506,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"will at the last, forgetting all else, return to the hills to die."
4507,NAMGAY DOOLA.,The clouds closed and the smell went away  and there remained nothing
4508,NAMGAY DOOLA.,in all the world except chilling white mist and the boom of the
4509,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Sutlej river racing through the valley below. A fat-tailed sheep, who"
4510,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"did not want to die, bleated piteously at my tent door. He was"
4511,NAMGAY DOOLA.,scuffling with the Prime Minister and the Director-General of Public
4512,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Education, and he was a royal gift to me and my camp servants. I"
4513,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"expressed my thanks suitably, and asked if I might have audience of"
4514,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"the King. The Prime Minister readjusted his turban, which had fallen"
4515,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"off in the struggle, and assured me that the King would be very"
4516,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"pleased to see me. Therefore, I despatched  two bottles as a"
4517,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"foretaste, and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation"
4518,NAMGAY DOOLA.,went to the King's Palace through the wet. He had sent his army to
4519,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"escort me, but the army stayed to talk with my cook. Soldiers are"
4520,NAMGAY DOOLA.,very much alike all the world over.
4521,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4522,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"The Palace was a four-roomed, and whitewashed mud and timber-house,"
4523,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the finest in all the hills for a day's journey. The King was dressed
4524,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"in a purple velvet jacket, white muslin trousers, and a"
4525,NAMGAY DOOLA.,saffron-yellow turban of price. He gave me audience in a little
4526,NAMGAY DOOLA.,carpeted room opening off the palace courtyard which was occupied by
4527,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the Elephant of State. The great beast was sheeted and anchored from
4528,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"trunk to tail, and the curve of his back stood out grandly against"
4529,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the mist.
4530,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4531,NAMGAY DOOLA.,The Prime Minister and the Director-General of Public Education were
4532,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"present to introduce me, but all the court had been dismissed, lest"
4533,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals. The King cast
4534,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"a wreath of heavy-scented flowers round my neck as I bowed, and"
4535,NAMGAY DOOLA.,inquired how my honoured presence had the felicity to be. I said that
4536,NAMGAY DOOLA.,through seeing his auspicious countenance the mists of the night had
4537,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"turned into sunshine, and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his"
4538,NAMGAY DOOLA.,good deeds would be remembered by the Gods. He said that since I had
4539,NAMGAY DOOLA.,set my magnificent foot in his Kingdom the crops would probably
4540,NAMGAY DOOLA.,yield seventy per cent. more than the average. I said that the fame
4541,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"of the King had reached to the four corners of the earth, and that"
4542,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the nations gnashed their teeth when they heard daily of the glories
4543,NAMGAY DOOLA.,of his realm and the wisdom of his moon-like Prime Minister and
4544,NAMGAY DOOLA.,lotus-like Director-General of Public Education.
4545,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4546,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Then we sat down on clean white cushions, and I was at the King's"
4547,NAMGAY DOOLA.,right hand. Three minutes later he was telling me that the state of
4548,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"the maize crop was something disgraceful, and that the Railway"
4549,NAMGAY DOOLA.,companies would not pay him enough for his timber. The talk shifted
4550,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"to and fro with the bottles, and we discussed very many stately"
4551,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"things, and the King became confidential on the subject of Government"
4552,NAMGAY DOOLA.,generally. Most of all he dwelt on the shortcomings of one of his
4553,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"subjects, who, from all I could gather, had been paralysing the"
4554,NAMGAY DOOLA.,executive.
4555,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4556,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'In the old days,' said the King, 'I could have ordered the Elephant"
4557,NAMGAY DOOLA.,yonder to trample him to death. Now I must e'en send him seventy
4558,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"miles across the hills to be tried, and his keep would be upon the"
4559,NAMGAY DOOLA.,State. The Elephant eats everything.'
4560,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4561,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'What be the man's crimes, Rajah Sahib?' said I."
4562,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4563,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Firstly, he is an outlander and no man of mine own people. Secondly,"
4564,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"since of my favour I gave him land upon his first coming, he refuses"
4565,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"to pay revenue. Am I not the lord of the earth, above and below,"
4566,NAMGAY DOOLA.,entitled by right and custom to one-eighth of the crop? Yet this
4567,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"devil, establishing himself, refuses to pay a single tax; and he"
4568,NAMGAY DOOLA.,brings a poisonous spawn of babes.'
4569,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4570,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Cast him into jail,' I said."
4571,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4572,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Sahib,' the King answered, shifting a little on the cushions, 'once"
4573,NAMGAY DOOLA.,and only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that I
4574,NAMGAY DOOLA.,was not able to go abroad. In that hour I made a vow to my God that I
4575,NAMGAY DOOLA.,would never again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the
4576,NAMGAY DOOLA.,air of God; for I perceived the nature of the punishment. How can I
4577,NAMGAY DOOLA.,break my vow? Were it only the lopping of a hand or a foot I should
4578,NAMGAY DOOLA.,not delay. But even that is impossible now that the English have
4579,NAMGAY DOOLA.,rule. One or another of my people'--he looked obliquely at the
4580,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Director-General of Public Education--'would at once write a letter
4581,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"to the Viceroy, and perhaps I should be deprived of my ruffle of"
4582,NAMGAY DOOLA.,drums.'
4583,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4584,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"He unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver water-pipe, fitted a plain"
4585,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"amber mouthpiece, and passed his pipe to me. 'Not content with"
4586,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"refusing revenue,' he continued, 'this outlander refuses also the"
4587,NAMGAY DOOLA.,_begar_' (this was the corvée or forced labour on the roads) 'and
4588,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"stirs my people up to the like treason. Yet he is, when he wills, an"
4589,NAMGAY DOOLA.,expert log-snatcher. There is none better or bolder among my people
4590,NAMGAY DOOLA.,to clear a block of the river when the logs stick fast.'
4591,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4592,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'But he worships strange Gods,' said the Prime Minister"
4593,NAMGAY DOOLA.,deferentially.
4594,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4595,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'For that I have no concern,' said the King, who was as tolerant as"
4596,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Akbar in matters of belief. 'To each man his own God and the fire or
4597,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Mother Earth for us all at last. It is the rebellion that offends
4598,NAMGAY DOOLA.,me.'
4599,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4600,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'The King has an army,' I suggested. 'Has not the King burned the"
4601,NAMGAY DOOLA.,man's house and left him naked to the night dews?'
4602,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4603,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Nay, a hut is a hut, and it holds the life of a man. But once, I"
4604,NAMGAY DOOLA.,sent my army against him when his excuses became wearisome: of their
4605,NAMGAY DOOLA.,heads he brake three across the top with a stick. The other two men
4606,NAMGAY DOOLA.,ran away. Also the guns would not shoot.'
4607,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4608,NAMGAY DOOLA.,I had seen the equipment of the infantry. One-third of it was an old
4609,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"muzzle-loading fowling-piece, with a ragged rust-hole where the"
4610,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"nipples should have been, one-third a wire-bound match-lock with a"
4611,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"worm-eaten stock, and one-third a four-bore flint duck-gun without a"
4612,NAMGAY DOOLA.,flint.
4613,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4614,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'But it is to be remembered,' said the King, reaching out for the"
4615,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"bottle, 'that he is a very expert log-snatcher and a man of a merry"
4616,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"face. What shall I do to him, Sahib?'"
4617,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4618,NAMGAY DOOLA.,This was interesting. The timid hill-folk would as soon have refused
4619,NAMGAY DOOLA.,taxes to their King as revenues to their Gods.
4620,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4621,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'If it be the King's permission,' I said, 'I will not strike my tents"
4622,NAMGAY DOOLA.,till the third day and I will see this man. The mercy of the King is
4623,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"God-like, and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft. Moreover,"
4624,NAMGAY DOOLA.,both the bottles and another be empty.'
4625,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4626,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'You have my leave to go,' said the King."
4627,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4628,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Next morning a crier went through the State proclaiming that there
4629,NAMGAY DOOLA.,was a log-jam on the river and that it behoved all loyal subjects to
4630,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"remove it. The people poured down from their villages to the moist,"
4631,NAMGAY DOOLA.,warm valley of poppy-fields; and the King and I went with them.
4632,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Hundreds of dressed deodar-logs had caught on a snag of rock, and the"
4633,NAMGAY DOOLA.,river was bringing down more logs every minute to complete the
4634,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"blockade. The water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber,"
4635,NAMGAY DOOLA.,and the population of the State began prodding the nearest logs with
4636,NAMGAY DOOLA.,a pole in the hope of starting a general movement. Then there went up
4637,NAMGAY DOOLA.,a shout of 'Namgay Doola! Namgay Doola!' and a large red-haired
4638,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"villager hurried up, stripping off his clothes as he ran."
4639,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4640,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'That is he. That is the rebel,' said the King. 'Now will the dam be"
4641,NAMGAY DOOLA.,cleared.'
4642,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4643,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'But why has he red hair?' I asked, since red hair among hill-folks"
4644,NAMGAY DOOLA.,is as common as blue or green.
4645,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4646,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'He is an outlander,' said the King. 'Well done! Oh, well done!'"
4647,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4648,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Namgay Doola had scrambled out on the jam and was clawing out the
4649,NAMGAY DOOLA.,butt of a log with a rude sort of boat-hook. It slid forward slowly
4650,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"as an alligator moves, three or four others followed it, and the"
4651,NAMGAY DOOLA.,green water spouted through the gaps they had made. Then the
4652,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"villagers howled and shouted and scrambled across the logs, pulling"
4653,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"and pushing the obstinate timber, and the red head of Namgay Doola"
4654,NAMGAY DOOLA.,was chief among them all. The logs swayed and chafed and groaned as
4655,NAMGAY DOOLA.,fresh consignments from upstream battered the now weakening dam. All
4656,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"gave way at last in a smother of foam, racing logs, bobbing black"
4657,NAMGAY DOOLA.,heads and confusion indescribable. The river tossed everything before
4658,NAMGAY DOOLA.,it. I saw the red head go down with the last remnants of the jam and
4659,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"disappear between the great grinding, tree-trunks. It rose close to"
4660,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the bank and blowing like a grampus. Namgay Doola wrung the water out
4661,NAMGAY DOOLA.,of his eyes and made obeisance to the King. I had time to observe him
4662,NAMGAY DOOLA.,closely. The virulent redness of his shock head and beard was most
4663,NAMGAY DOOLA.,startling; and in the thicket of hair wrinkled above high cheek bones
4664,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"shone two very merry blue eyes. He was indeed an outlander, but yet a"
4665,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Thibetan in language, habit, and attire. He spoke the Lepcha dialect"
4666,NAMGAY DOOLA.,with an indescribable softening of the gutturals. It was not so much
4667,NAMGAY DOOLA.,a lisp as an accent.
4668,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4669,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'Whence comest thou?' I asked.
4670,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4671,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'From Thibet.' He pointed across the hills and grinned. That grin
4672,NAMGAY DOOLA.,went straight to my heart. Mechanically I held out my hand and Namgay
4673,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Doola shook it. No pure Thibetan would have understood the meaning of
4674,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"the gesture. He went away to look for his clothes, and as he climbed"
4675,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"back to his village, I heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably"
4676,NAMGAY DOOLA.,familiar. It was the whooping of Namgay Doola.
4677,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4678,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'You see now,' said the King, 'why I would not kill him. He is a bold"
4679,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"man among my logs, but,' and he shook his head like a schoolmaster,"
4680,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'I know that before long there will be complaints of him in the
4681,NAMGAY DOOLA.,court. Let us return to the Palace and do justice.' It was that
4682,NAMGAY DOOLA.,King's custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven and
4683,NAMGAY DOOLA.,three o'clock. I saw him decide equitably in weighty matters of
4684,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"trespass, slander, and a little wife-stealing. Then his brow clouded"
4685,NAMGAY DOOLA.,and he summoned me.
4686,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4687,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Again it is Namgay Doola,' he said despairingly. 'Not content with"
4688,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"refusing revenue on his own part, he has bound half his village by an"
4689,NAMGAY DOOLA.,oath to the like treason. Never before has such a thing befallen me!
4690,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Nor are my taxes heavy.'
4691,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4692,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'O King,' said I. 'If it be the King's will let this matter stand"
4693,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"over till the morning. Only the Gods can do right swiftly, and it may"
4694,NAMGAY DOOLA.,be that yonder villager has lied.'
4695,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4696,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Nay, for I know the nature of Namgay Doola; but since a guest asks"
4697,NAMGAY DOOLA.,let the matter remain. Wilt thou speak harshly to this red-headed
4698,NAMGAY DOOLA.,outlander. He may listen to thee.'
4699,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4700,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"I made an attempt that very evening, but for the life of me I could"
4701,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"not keep my countenance. Namgay Doola grinned persuasively, and began"
4702,NAMGAY DOOLA.,to tell me about a big brown bear in a poppy-field by the river.
4703,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Would I care to shoot it? I spoke austerely on the sin of conspiracy,"
4704,NAMGAY DOOLA.,and the certainty of punishment. Namgay Doola's face clouded for a
4705,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"moment. Shortly afterwards he withdrew from my tent, and I heard him"
4706,NAMGAY DOOLA.,singing to himself softly among the pines. The words were
4707,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"unintelligible to me, but the tune, like his liquid insinuating"
4708,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"speech, seemed the ghost of something strangely familiar."
4709,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4710,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Dir hané mard-i-yemen dir
4711,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"To weeree ala gee,"
4712,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4713,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"sang Namgay Doola again and again, and I racked my brain for that"
4714,NAMGAY DOOLA.,lost tune. It was not till after dinner that I discovered some one
4715,NAMGAY DOOLA.,had cut a square foot of velvet from the centre of my best
4716,NAMGAY DOOLA.,camera-cloth. This made me so angry that I wandered down the valley
4717,NAMGAY DOOLA.,in the hope of meeting the big brown bear. I could hear him grunting
4718,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"like a discontented pig in the poppy-field, and I waited shoulder"
4719,NAMGAY DOOLA.,deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn to catch him after his meal. The
4720,NAMGAY DOOLA.,moon was at full and drew out the rich scent of the tasselled crop.
4721,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Then I heard the anguished bellow of a Himalayan cow, one of the"
4722,NAMGAY DOOLA.,little black crummies no bigger than Newfoundland dogs. Two shadows
4723,NAMGAY DOOLA.,that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me. I was in act to
4724,NAMGAY DOOLA.,fire when I saw that they had each a brilliant red head. The lesser
4725,NAMGAY DOOLA.,animal was trailing some rope behind it that left a dark track on the
4726,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"path. They passed within six feet of me, and the shadow of the"
4727,NAMGAY DOOLA.,moonlight lay velvet-black on their faces. Velvet-black was exactly
4728,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"the word, for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the"
4729,NAMGAY DOOLA.,velvet of my camera cloth! I marvelled and went to bed. Next morning
4730,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"the Kingdom was in uproar. Namgay Doola, men said, had gone forth in"
4731,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a cow
4732,NAMGAY DOOLA.,belonging to the rabbit-faced villager who had betrayed him. It was
4733,NAMGAY DOOLA.,sacrilege unspeakable against the Holy Cow. The State desired his
4734,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"blood, but he had retreated into his hut, barricaded the doors and"
4735,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"windows with big stones, and defied the world."
4736,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4737,NAMGAY DOOLA.,The King and I and the Populace approached the hut cautiously. There
4738,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"was no hope of capturing the man without loss of life, for from a"
4739,NAMGAY DOOLA.,hole in the wall projected the muzzle of an extremely
4740,NAMGAY DOOLA.,well-cared-for gun--the only gun in the State that could shoot.
4741,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Namgay Doola had narrowly missed a villager just before we came up.
4742,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"The Standing Army stood. It could do no more, for when it advanced"
4743,NAMGAY DOOLA.,pieces of sharp shale flew from the windows. To these were added from
4744,NAMGAY DOOLA.,time to time showers of scalding water. We saw red heads bobbing up
4745,NAMGAY DOOLA.,and down in the hut. The family of Namgay Doola were aiding their
4746,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"sire, and blood-curdling yells of defiance were the only answers to"
4747,NAMGAY DOOLA.,our prayers.
4748,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4749,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Never,' said the King, puffing, 'has such a thing befallen my State."
4750,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Next year I will certainly buy a little cannon.' He looked at me
4751,NAMGAY DOOLA.,imploringly.
4752,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4753,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Is there any priest in the Kingdom to whom he will listen?' said I,"
4754,NAMGAY DOOLA.,for a light was beginning to break upon me.
4755,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4756,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'He worships his own God,' said the Prime Minister. We can starve him"
4757,NAMGAY DOOLA.,out.'
4758,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4759,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Let the white man approach,' said Namgay Doola from within. All"
4760,NAMGAY DOOLA.,others I will kill. Send me the white man.'
4761,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4762,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"A rabbit-faced villager, with a blush-rose stuck behind his ear,"
4763,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"advanced trembling. He had been in the conspiracy, but had told"
4764,NAMGAY DOOLA.,everything and hoped for the King's favour.
4765,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4766,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4767,NAMGAY DOOLA.,The door was thrown open and I entered the smoky interior of a
4768,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Thibetan hut crammed with children. And every child had flaming red
4769,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"hair. A raw cow's tail lay on the floor, and by its side two pieces"
4770,NAMGAY DOOLA.,of black velvet--my black velvet--rudely hacked into the semblance of
4771,NAMGAY DOOLA.,masks.
4772,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4773,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'And what is this shame, Namgay Doola?' said I."
4774,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4775,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"He grinned more winningly than ever. 'There is no shame,' said he. 'I"
4776,NAMGAY DOOLA.,did but cut off the tail of that man's cow. He betrayed me. I was
4777,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"minded to shoot him, Sahib. But not to death. Indeed not to death."
4778,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Only in the legs.'
4779,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4780,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'And why at all, since it is the custom to pay revenue to the King?"
4781,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Why at all?'
4782,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4783,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'By the God of my father I cannot tell,' said Namgay Doola."
4784,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4785,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'And who was thy father?'
4786,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4787,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'The same that had this gun.' He showed me his weapon--a Tower musket
4788,NAMGAY DOOLA.,bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the Honourable East India Company.
4789,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4790,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'And thy father's name?' said I.
4791,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4792,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Timlay Doola,' said he. 'At the first, I being then a little child,"
4793,NAMGAY DOOLA.,it is in my mind that he wore a red coat.'
4794,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4795,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'Of that I have no doubt. But repeat the name of thy father thrice or
4796,NAMGAY DOOLA.,four times.'
4797,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4798,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"He obeyed, and I understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech"
4799,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"came. 'Thimla Dhula,' said he excitedly. 'To this hour I worship his"
4800,NAMGAY DOOLA.,God.'
4801,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4802,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'May I see that God?'
4803,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4804,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'In a little while--at twilight time.'
4805,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4806,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'Rememberest thou aught of thy father's speech?'
4807,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4808,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'It is long ago. But there is one word which he said often. Thus
4809,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"""_Shun_."" Then I and my brethren stood upon our feet, our hands to"
4810,NAMGAY DOOLA.,our sides. Thus.'
4811,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4812,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'Even so. And what was thy mother?'
4813,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4814,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'A woman of the hills. We be Lepchas of Darjeeling, but me they call"
4815,NAMGAY DOOLA.,an outlander because my hair is as thou seest.'
4816,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4817,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"The Thibetan woman, his wife, touched him on the arm gently. The long"
4818,NAMGAY DOOLA.,parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day. It was now close
4819,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"upon twilight--the hour of the Angelus. Very solemnly, the red-headed"
4820,NAMGAY DOOLA.,brats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle. Namgay Doola laid
4821,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"his gun against the wall, lighted a little oil lamp, and set it"
4822,NAMGAY DOOLA.,before a recess in the wall. Pulling aside a curtain of dirty cloth
4823,NAMGAY DOOLA.,he revealed a worn brass crucifix leaning against the helmet-badge of
4824,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"a long forgotten East India regiment. 'Thus did my father,' he said,"
4825,NAMGAY DOOLA.,crossing himself clumsily. The wife and children followed suit. Then
4826,NAMGAY DOOLA.,all together they struck up the wailing chant that I heard on the
4827,NAMGAY DOOLA.,hillside--
4828,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4829,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Dir hané mard-i-yemen dir
4830,NAMGAY DOOLA.,To weeree ala gee.
4831,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4832,NAMGAY DOOLA.,I was puzzled no longer. Again and again they crooned as if their
4833,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"hearts would break, their version of the chorus of the _Wearing of"
4834,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the Green_--
4835,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4836,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"They're hanging men and women too,"
4837,NAMGAY DOOLA.,For the wearing of the green.
4838,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4839,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"A diabolical inspiration came to me. One of the brats, a boy about"
4840,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"eight years old, was watching me as he sang. I pulled out a rupee,"
4841,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"held the coin between finger and thumb, and looked--only looked--at"
4842,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the gun against the wall. A grin of brilliant and perfect
4843,NAMGAY DOOLA.,comprehension overspread the face of the child. Never for an instant
4844,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"stopping the song he held out his hand for the money, and then slid"
4845,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the gun to my hand. I might have shot Namgay Doola as he chanted.
4846,NAMGAY DOOLA.,But I was satisfied. The blood-instinct of the race held true.
4847,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Namgay Doola drew the curtain across the recess. Angelus was over.
4848,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4849,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Thus my father sang. There was much more, but I have forgotten, and"
4850,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"I do not know the purport of these words, but it may be that the God"
4851,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"will understand. I am not of this people, and I will not pay"
4852,NAMGAY DOOLA.,revenue.'
4853,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4854,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'And why?'
4855,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4856,NAMGAY DOOLA.,Again that soul-compelling grin. 'What occupation would be to me
4857,NAMGAY DOOLA.,between crop and crop? It is better than scaring bears. But these
4858,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"people do not understand.' He picked the masks from the floor, and"
4859,NAMGAY DOOLA.,looked in my face as simply as a child.
4860,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4861,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'By what road didst thou attain knowledge to make these devilries?' I
4862,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"said, pointing."
4863,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4864,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'I cannot tell. I am but a Lepcha of Darjeeling, and yet the"
4865,NAMGAY DOOLA.,stuff----'
4866,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4867,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'Which thou hast stolen.'
4868,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4869,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Nay, surely. Did I steal? I desired it so. The stuff--the"
4870,NAMGAY DOOLA.,stuff--what else should I have done with the stuff?' He twisted the
4871,NAMGAY DOOLA.,velvet between his fingers.
4872,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4873,NAMGAY DOOLA.,'But the sin of maiming the cow--consider that?'
4874,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4875,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'That is true; but oh, Sahib, that man betrayed me and I had no"
4876,NAMGAY DOOLA.,thought--but the heifer's tail waved in the moonlight and I had my
4877,NAMGAY DOOLA.,knife. What else should I have done? The tail came off ere I was
4878,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"aware. Sahib, thou knowest more than I.'"
4879,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4880,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'That is true,' said I. 'Stay within the door. I go to speak to the"
4881,NAMGAY DOOLA.,King.'
4882,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4883,NAMGAY DOOLA.,The population of the State were ranged on the hillsides. I went
4884,NAMGAY DOOLA.,forth and spoke to the King.
4885,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4886,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Oh King,' said I. 'Touching this man there be two courses open to"
4887,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"thy wisdom. Thou canst either hang him from a tree, he and his brood,"
4888,NAMGAY DOOLA.,till there remains no hair that is red within the land.'
4889,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4890,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Nay,' said the King. 'Why should I hurt the little children?'"
4891,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4892,NAMGAY DOOLA.,They had poured out of the hut door and were making plump obeisance
4893,NAMGAY DOOLA.,to everybody. Nanigay Doola waited with his gun across his arm.
4894,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4895,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'Or thou canst, discarding the impiety of the cow-maiming, raise him"
4896,NAMGAY DOOLA.,to honour in thy Army. He comes of a race that will not pay revenue.
4897,NAMGAY DOOLA.,A red flame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in
4898,NAMGAY DOOLA.,that glowing hair. Make him chief of the Army. Give him honour as may
4899,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"befall, and full allowance of work, but look to it, O King, that"
4900,NAMGAY DOOLA.,neither he nor his hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward. Feed
4901,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"him with words and favour, and also liquor from certain bottles that"
4902,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"thou knowest of, and he will be a bulwark of defence. But deny him"
4903,NAMGAY DOOLA.,even a tuft of grass for his own. This is the nature that God has
4904,NAMGAY DOOLA.,given him. Moreover he has brethren----'
4905,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4906,NAMGAY DOOLA.,The State groaned unanimously.
4907,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4908,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"'But if his brethren come, they will surely fight with each other"
4909,NAMGAY DOOLA.,till they die; or else the one will always give information
4910,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"concerning the other. Shall he be of thy Army, O King? Choose.'"
4911,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4912,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"The King bowed his head, and I said, 'Come forth, Namgay Doola, and"
4913,NAMGAY DOOLA.,command the King's Army. Thy name shall no more be Namgay in the
4914,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"mouths of men, but Patsay Doola, for as thou hast said, I know.'"
4915,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4916,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"Then Namgay Doola, new christened Patsay Doola, son of Timlay Doola,"
4917,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"which is Tim Doolan gone very wrong indeed, clasped the King's feet,"
4918,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"cuffed the standing Army, and hurried in an agony of contrition from"
4919,NAMGAY DOOLA.,"temple to temple, making offerings for the sin of cattle maiming."
4920,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4921,NAMGAY DOOLA.,And the King was so pleased with my perspicacity that he offered to
4922,NAMGAY DOOLA.,sell me a village for twenty pounds sterling. But I buy no villages
4923,NAMGAY DOOLA.,in the Himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of
4924,NAMGAY DOOLA.,the heaven-climbing glacier and the dark birch-forest.
4925,NAMGAY DOOLA.,
4926,NAMGAY DOOLA.,I know that breed.

4937,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4938,A GERM-DESTROYER,"As a general rule, it is inexpedient to meddle with questions of"
4939,A GERM-DESTROYER,State in a land where men are highly paid to work them out for you.
4940,A GERM-DESTROYER,This tale is a justifiable exception.
4941,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4942,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Once in every five years, as you know, we indent for a new Viceroy;"
4943,A GERM-DESTROYER,"and each Viceroy imports, with the rest of his baggage, a Private"
4944,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Secretary, who may or may not be the real Viceroy, just as Fate"
4945,A GERM-DESTROYER,ordains. Fate looks after the Indian Empire because it is so big and
4946,A GERM-DESTROYER,so helpless.
4947,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4948,A GERM-DESTROYER,There was a Viceroy once who brought out with him a turbulent Private
4949,A GERM-DESTROYER,Secretary--a hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for
4950,A GERM-DESTROYER,work. This Secretary was called Wonder--John Fennil Wonder. The
4951,A GERM-DESTROYER,Viceroy possessed no name--nothing but a string of counties and
4952,A GERM-DESTROYER,"two-thirds of the alphabet after them. He said, in confidence, that"
4953,A GERM-DESTROYER,"he was the electro-plated figurehead of a golden administration, and"
4954,A GERM-DESTROYER,"he watched in a dreamy, amused way Wonder's attempts to draw matters"
4955,A GERM-DESTROYER,which were entirely outside his province into his own hands. 'When we
4956,A GERM-DESTROYER,"are all cherubims together,' said His Excellency once, 'my dear, good"
4957,A GERM-DESTROYER,friend Wonder will head the conspiracy for plucking out Gabriel's
4958,A GERM-DESTROYER,tail feathers or stealing Peter's keys. _Then_ I shall report him.'
4959,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4960,A GERM-DESTROYER,"But, though the Viceroy did nothing to check Wonder's officiousness,"
4961,A GERM-DESTROYER,other people said unpleasant things. May be the Members of Council
4962,A GERM-DESTROYER,began it; but finally all Simla agreed that there was 'too much
4963,A GERM-DESTROYER,Wonder and too little Viceroy' in that rule. Wonder was always
4964,A GERM-DESTROYER,"quoting 'His Excellency.' It was 'His Excellency this,' 'His"
4965,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Excellency that,' 'In the opinion of His Excellency,' and so on. The"
4966,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Viceroy smiled; but he did not heed. He said that, so long as his old"
4967,A GERM-DESTROYER,"men squabbled with his 'dear, good Wonder,' they might be induced to"
4968,A GERM-DESTROYER,leave the Immemorial East in peace.
4969,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4970,A GERM-DESTROYER,"'No wise man has a Policy,' said the Viceroy. 'A Policy is the"
4971,A GERM-DESTROYER,"blackmail levied on the Fool by the Unforeseen. I am not the former,"
4972,A GERM-DESTROYER,and I do not believe in the latter.'
4973,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4974,A GERM-DESTROYER,"I do not quite see what this means, unless it refers to an Insurance"
4975,A GERM-DESTROYER,Policy. Perhaps it was the Viceroy's way of saying. 'Lie low.'
4976,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4977,A GERM-DESTROYER,That season came up to Simla one of these crazy people with only a
4978,A GERM-DESTROYER,single idea. These are the men who make things move; but they are not
4979,A GERM-DESTROYER,"nice to talk to. This man's name was Mellish, and he had lived for"
4980,A GERM-DESTROYER,"fifteen years on land of his own, in Lower Bengal, studying cholera."
4981,A GERM-DESTROYER,He held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew
4982,A GERM-DESTROYER,through a muggy atmosphere; and stuck in the branches of trees like a
4983,A GERM-DESTROYER,"wool-flake. The germ could be rendered sterile, he said, by"
4984,A GERM-DESTROYER,'Mellish's Own Invincible Fumigatory'--a heavy violet-black powder--'
4985,A GERM-DESTROYER,"the result of fifteen years' scientific investigation, Sir!'"
4986,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4987,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Inventors seem very much alike as a caste. They talk loudly,"
4988,A GERM-DESTROYER,especially about 'conspiracies of monopolists'; they beat upon the
4989,A GERM-DESTROYER,table with their fists; and they secrete fragments of their
4990,A GERM-DESTROYER,inventions about their persons.
4991,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4992,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Mellish said that there was a Medical 'Ring' at Simla, headed by the"
4993,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Surgeon-General, who was in league, apparently, with all the Hospital"
4994,A GERM-DESTROYER,Assistants in the Empire.
4995,A GERM-DESTROYER,
4996,A GERM-DESTROYER,"I forget exactly how he proved it, but it had something to do with"
4997,A GERM-DESTROYER,'skulking up to the Hills'; and what Mellish wanted was the
4998,A GERM-DESTROYER,independent evidence of the Viceroy--'Steward of our Most Gracious
4999,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Majesty the Queen, Sir.' So Mellish went up to Simla, with"
5000,A GERM-DESTROYER,"eighty-four pounds of Fumigatory in his trunk, to speak to the"
5001,A GERM-DESTROYER,Viceroy and to show him the merits of the invention.
5002,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5003,A GERM-DESTROYER,"But it is easier to see a Viceroy than to talk to him, unless you"
5004,A GERM-DESTROYER,chance to be as important as Mellishe of Madras. He was a
5005,A GERM-DESTROYER,"six-thousand-rupee man, so great that his daughters never 'married.'"
5006,A GERM-DESTROYER,They 'contracted alliances.' He himself was not paid. He 'received
5007,A GERM-DESTROYER,"emoluments,' and his journeys about the country were 'tours of"
5008,A GERM-DESTROYER,observation.' His business was to stir up the people in Madras with a
5009,A GERM-DESTROYER,long pole--as you stir up tench in a pond--and the people had to come
5010,A GERM-DESTROYER,up out of their comfortable old ways and gasp--'This is Enlightenment
5011,A GERM-DESTROYER,and Progress. Isn't it fine!' Then they give Mellishe statues and
5012,A GERM-DESTROYER,"jasmine garlands, in the hope of getting rid of him."
5013,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5014,A GERM-DESTROYER,Mellishe came up to Simla 'to confer with the Viceroy.' That was one
5015,A GERM-DESTROYER,of his perquisites. The Viceroy knew nothing of Mellishe except that
5016,A GERM-DESTROYER,he was 'one of those middle-class deities who seem necessary to the
5017,A GERM-DESTROYER,"spiritual comfort of this Paradise of the Middle-classes,' and that,"
5018,A GERM-DESTROYER,"in all probability he had 'suggested, designed, founded, and endowed"
5019,A GERM-DESTROYER,all the public institutions in Madras.' Which proves that His
5020,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Excellency, though dreamy, had experience of the ways of"
5021,A GERM-DESTROYER,six-thousand-rupee men.
5022,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5023,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Mellishe's name was E. Mellishe, and Mellish's was E.S. Mellish, and"
5024,A GERM-DESTROYER,"they were both staying at the same hotel, and the Fate that looks"
5025,A GERM-DESTROYER,after the Indian Empire ordained that Wonder should blunder and drop
5026,A GERM-DESTROYER,"the final '_e_'; that the Chaprassi should help him, and that the"
5027,A GERM-DESTROYER,note which ran--
5028,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5029,A GERM-DESTROYER,"DEAR MR. MELLISH,--Can you set aside your other engagements, and"
5030,A GERM-DESTROYER,lunch with us at two to-morrow? His Excellency has an hour at your
5031,A GERM-DESTROYER,"disposal then,"
5032,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5033,A GERM-DESTROYER,should be given to Mellish with the Fumigatory. He nearly wept with
5034,A GERM-DESTROYER,"pride and delight, and at the appointed hour cantered to Peterhoff, a"
5035,A GERM-DESTROYER,big paper-bag full of the Fumigatory in his coat-tail pockets. He had
5036,A GERM-DESTROYER,"his chance, and he meant to make the most of it. Mellishe of Madras"
5037,A GERM-DESTROYER,"had been so portentously solemn about his 'conference,' that Wonder"
5038,A GERM-DESTROYER,"had arranged for a private tiffin,--no A.-D.-C.'s, no Wonder, no one"
5039,A GERM-DESTROYER,"but the Viceroy, who said plaintively that he feared being left alone"
5040,A GERM-DESTROYER,with unmuzzled autocrats like the great Mellishe of Madras.
5041,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5042,A GERM-DESTROYER,"But his guest did not bore the Viceroy. On the contrary, he amused"
5043,A GERM-DESTROYER,"him. Mellish was nervously anxious to go straight to his Fumigatory,"
5044,A GERM-DESTROYER,and talked at random until tiffin was over and His Excellency asked
5045,A GERM-DESTROYER,him to smoke. The Viceroy was pleased with Mellish because he did not
5046,A GERM-DESTROYER,talk 'shop.'
5047,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5048,A GERM-DESTROYER,"As soon as the cheroots were lit, Mellish spoke like a man; beginning"
5049,A GERM-DESTROYER,"with his cholera-theory, reviewing his fifteen years' 'scientific"
5050,A GERM-DESTROYER,"labours,' the machinations of the 'Simla Ring,' and the excellence of"
5051,A GERM-DESTROYER,"his Fumigatory, while the Viceroy watched him between half-shut eyes"
5052,A GERM-DESTROYER,and thought--'Evidently this is the wrong tiger; but it is an
5053,A GERM-DESTROYER,"original animal.' Mellish's hair was standing on end with excitement,"
5054,A GERM-DESTROYER,"and he stammered. He began groping in his coat-tails and, before the"
5055,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Viceroy knew what was about to happen, he had tipped a bagful of his"
5056,A GERM-DESTROYER,powder into the big silver ash-tray.
5057,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5058,A GERM-DESTROYER,"'J-j-judge for yourself, Sir,' said Mellish. 'Y' Excellency shall"
5059,A GERM-DESTROYER,"judge for yourself! Absolutely infallible, on my honour.'"
5060,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5061,A GERM-DESTROYER,"He plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder, which began"
5062,A GERM-DESTROYER,"to smoke like a volcano, and send up fat, greasy wreaths of"
5063,A GERM-DESTROYER,copper-coloured smoke. In five seconds the room was filled with a
5064,A GERM-DESTROYER,most pungent and sickening stench--a reek that took fierce hold of
5065,A GERM-DESTROYER,"the trap of your wind-pipe and shut it. The powder hissed and fizzed,"
5066,A GERM-DESTROYER,"and sent out blue and green sparks, and the smoke rose till you"
5067,A GERM-DESTROYER,"could neither see, nor breathe, nor gasp. Mellish, however, was used"
5068,A GERM-DESTROYER,to it.
5069,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5070,A GERM-DESTROYER,"'Nitrate of strontia,' he shouted; 'baryta, bone-meal, _etcetera_!"
5071,A GERM-DESTROYER,Thousand cubic feet smoke per cubic inch. Not a germ could live--not
5072,A GERM-DESTROYER,"a germ, Y' Excellency!'"
5073,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5074,A GERM-DESTROYER,"But His Excellency had fled, and was coughing at the foot of the"
5075,A GERM-DESTROYER,"stairs, while all Peterhoff hummed like a hive. Red Lancers came in,"
5076,A GERM-DESTROYER,"and the head Chaprassi who speaks English came in, and mace-bearers"
5077,A GERM-DESTROYER,"came in, and ladies ran downstairs screaming, 'Fire'; for the smoke"
5078,A GERM-DESTROYER,"was drifting through the house and oozing out of the windows, and"
5079,A GERM-DESTROYER,"bellying along the verandahs, and wreathing and writhing across the"
5080,A GERM-DESTROYER,gardens. No one could enter the room where Mellish was lecturing on
5081,A GERM-DESTROYER,his Fumigatory till that unspeakable powder had burned itself out.
5082,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5083,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Then an Aide-de-Camp, who desired the V.C., rushed through the"
5084,A GERM-DESTROYER,rolling clouds and hauled Mellish into the hall. The Viceroy was
5085,A GERM-DESTROYER,"prostrate with laughter, and could only waggle his hands feebly at"
5086,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Mellish, who was shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him."
5087,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5088,A GERM-DESTROYER,"'Glorious! Glorious!' sobbed His Excellency. 'Not a germ, as you"
5089,A GERM-DESTROYER,"justly observe, could exist! I can swear it. A magnificent success!'"
5090,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5091,A GERM-DESTROYER,"Then he laughed till the tears came, and Wonder, who had caught the"
5092,A GERM-DESTROYER,"real Mellishe snorting on the Mall, entered and was deeply shocked at"
5093,A GERM-DESTROYER,"the scene. But the Viceroy was delighted, because he saw that Wonder"
5094,A GERM-DESTROYER,"would presently depart. Mellish with the Fumigatory was also pleased,"
5095,A GERM-DESTROYER,for he felt that he had smashed the Simla Medical 'Ring.'
5096,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5097,A GERM-DESTROYER,Few men could tell a story like His Excellency when he took the
5098,A GERM-DESTROYER,"trouble, and his account of 'my dear, good Wonder's friend with the"
5099,A GERM-DESTROYER,"powder' went the round of Simla, and flippant folk made Wonder"
5100,A GERM-DESTROYER,unhappy by their remarks.
5101,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5102,A GERM-DESTROYER,But His Excellency told the tale once too often--for Wonder. As he
5103,A GERM-DESTROYER,meant to do. It was at a Seepee Picnic. Wonder was sitting just
5104,A GERM-DESTROYER,behind the Viceroy.
5105,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5106,A GERM-DESTROYER,"'And I really thought for a moment,' wound up His Excellency, 'that"
5107,A GERM-DESTROYER,"my dear, good Wonder had hired an assassin to clear his way to the"
5108,A GERM-DESTROYER,throne!'
5109,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5110,A GERM-DESTROYER,Every one laughed; but there was a delicate sub-tinkle in the
5111,A GERM-DESTROYER,Viceroy's tone which Wonder understood. He found that his health was
5112,A GERM-DESTROYER,"giving way; and the Viceroy allowed him to go, and presented him with"
5113,A GERM-DESTROYER,a flaming 'character' for use at Home among big people.
5114,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5115,A GERM-DESTROYER,"'My fault entirely,' said His Excellency, in after seasons, with a"
5116,A GERM-DESTROYER,twinkle in his eye. 'My inconsistency must always have been
5117,A GERM-DESTROYER,distasteful to such a masterly man.'
5118,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5119,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5120,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5121,A GERM-DESTROYER,
5122,'TIGER-TIGER!','TIGER-TIGER!'
5123,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5124,'TIGER-TIGER!',"What of the hunting, hunter bold?"
5125,'TIGER-TIGER!',"_Brother, the watch was long and cold_."
5126,'TIGER-TIGER!',What of the quarry ye went to kill?
5127,'TIGER-TIGER!',"_Brother, he crops in the jungle still_."
5128,'TIGER-TIGER!',Where is the power that made your pride?
5129,'TIGER-TIGER!',"_Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side_."
5130,'TIGER-TIGER!',Where is the haste that ye hurry by?
5131,'TIGER-TIGER!',"_Brother, I go to my lair to die_."
5132,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5133,'TIGER-TIGER!',When Mowgli left the wolf's cave after the fight with the Pack at the
5134,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Council Rock, he went down to the ploughed lands where the villagers"
5135,'TIGER-TIGER!',"lived, but he would not stop there because it was too near to the"
5136,'TIGER-TIGER!',"jungle, and he knew that he had made at least one bad enemy at the"
5137,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Council. So he hurried on, keeping to the rough road that ran down"
5138,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the valley, and followed it at a steady jog-trot for nearly twenty"
5139,'TIGER-TIGER!',"miles, till he came to a country that he did not know. The valley"
5140,'TIGER-TIGER!',opened out into a great plain dotted over with rocks and cut up by
5141,'TIGER-TIGER!',"ravines. At one end stood a little village, and at the other the"
5142,'TIGER-TIGER!',"thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds, and stopped"
5143,'TIGER-TIGER!',"there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the plain,"
5144,'TIGER-TIGER!',"cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in charge"
5145,'TIGER-TIGER!',"of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow"
5146,'TIGER-TIGER!',pariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli
5147,'TIGER-TIGER!',"walked on, for he was feeling hungry, and when he came to the village"
5148,'TIGER-TIGER!',gate he saw the big thornbush that was drawn up before the gate at
5149,'TIGER-TIGER!',"twilight, pushed to one side."
5150,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5151,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Umph!' he said, for he had come across more than one such barricade"
5152,'TIGER-TIGER!',in his night rambles after things to eat. 'So men are afraid of the
5153,'TIGER-TIGER!',"People of the Jungle here also.' He sat down by the gate, and when a"
5154,'TIGER-TIGER!',"man came out he stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to"
5155,'TIGER-TIGER!',"show that he wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one"
5156,'TIGER-TIGER!',"street of the village, shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat"
5157,'TIGER-TIGER!',"man dressed in white, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead."
5158,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The priest came to the gate, and with him at least a hundred people,"
5159,'TIGER-TIGER!',who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at Mowgli.
5160,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5161,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'They have no manners, these Men Folk,' said Mowgli to himself."
5162,'TIGER-TIGER!','Only the gray ape would behave as they do.' So he threw back his
5163,'TIGER-TIGER!',long hair and frowned at the crowd.
5164,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5165,'TIGER-TIGER!','What is there to be afraid of?' said the priest. 'Look at the marks
5166,'TIGER-TIGER!',on his arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a
5167,'TIGER-TIGER!',wolf-child run away from the jungle.'
5168,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5169,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli"
5170,'TIGER-TIGER!',"harder than they intended, and there were white scars all over his"
5171,'TIGER-TIGER!',arms and legs. But he would have been the last person in the world to
5172,'TIGER-TIGER!',"call these bites, for he knew what real biting meant."
5173,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5174,'TIGER-TIGER!','_Arré! arré!_' said two or three women together. 'To be bitten by
5175,'TIGER-TIGER!',"wolves, poor child! He is a handsome boy. He has eyes like red fire."
5176,'TIGER-TIGER!',"By my honour, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the"
5177,'TIGER-TIGER!',tiger.'
5178,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5179,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Let me look,' said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and"
5180,'TIGER-TIGER!',"ankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the palm of her hand. 'Indeed"
5181,'TIGER-TIGER!',"he is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.'"
5182,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5183,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The priest was a clever man, and he knew that Messua was wife to the"
5184,'TIGER-TIGER!',richest villager in the place. So he looked up at the sky for a
5185,'TIGER-TIGER!',"minute, and said solemnly: 'What the jungle has taken the jungle has"
5186,'TIGER-TIGER!',"restored. Take the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to"
5187,'TIGER-TIGER!',honour the priest who sees so far into the lives of men.'
5188,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5189,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'By the Bull that bought me,' said Mowgli to himself, 'but all this"
5190,'TIGER-TIGER!',"talking is like another looking over by the Pack! Well, if I am a"
5191,'TIGER-TIGER!',"man, a man I must be.'"
5192,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5193,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there"
5194,'TIGER-TIGER!',"was a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain-chest with funny"
5195,'TIGER-TIGER!',"raised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking-pots, an image of"
5196,'TIGER-TIGER!',"a Hindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking-glass,"
5197,'TIGER-TIGER!',such as they sell at the country fairs for eight cents.
5198,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5199,'TIGER-TIGER!',"She gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid"
5200,'TIGER-TIGER!',her hand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought
5201,'TIGER-TIGER!',perhaps that he might be her real son come back from the jungle where
5202,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the tiger had taken him. So she said: 'Nathoo, O Nathoo!' Mowgli did"
5203,'TIGER-TIGER!',not show that he knew the name. 'Dost thou not remember the day when
5204,'TIGER-TIGER!',"I gave thee thy new shoes?' She touched his foot, and it was almost"
5205,'TIGER-TIGER!',"as hard as horn. 'No,' she said, sorrowfully; 'those feet have never"
5206,'TIGER-TIGER!',"worn shoes, but thou art very like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my"
5207,'TIGER-TIGER!',son.'
5208,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5209,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before; but"
5210,'TIGER-TIGER!',"as he looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time"
5211,'TIGER-TIGER!',"if he wanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings."
5212,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'What is the good of a man,' he said to himself at last, 'if he does"
5213,'TIGER-TIGER!',not understand man's talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would
5214,'TIGER-TIGER!',be with us in the jungle. I must speak their talk.'
5215,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5216,'TIGER-TIGER!',He had not learned while he was with the wolves to imitate the
5217,'TIGER-TIGER!',challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little wild pig
5218,'TIGER-TIGER!',"for fun. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate"
5219,'TIGER-TIGER!',"it almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the name of many"
5220,'TIGER-TIGER!',things in the hut.
5221,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5222,'TIGER-TIGER!',"There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep"
5223,'TIGER-TIGER!',"under anything that looked so like a panther-trap as that hut, and"
5224,'TIGER-TIGER!',when they shut the door he went through the window. 'Give him his
5225,'TIGER-TIGER!',"will,' said Messua's husband. 'Remember he can never till now have"
5226,'TIGER-TIGER!',slept on a bed. If he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will
5227,'TIGER-TIGER!',not run away.'
5228,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5229,'TIGER-TIGER!',So Mowgli stretched himself in some long clean grass at the edge of
5230,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked"
5231,'TIGER-TIGER!',him under the chin.
5232,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5233,'TIGER-TIGER!','Phew!' said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolfs cubs).
5234,'TIGER-TIGER!','This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest
5235,'TIGER-TIGER!',"of wood-smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little"
5236,'TIGER-TIGER!',Brother; I bring news.'
5237,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5238,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Are all well in the jungle?' said Mowgli, hugging him."
5239,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5240,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now,"
5241,'TIGER-TIGER!',listen. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows
5242,'TIGER-TIGER!',"again, for he is badly singed. When he returns he swears that he will"
5243,'TIGER-TIGER!',lay thy bones in the Waingunga.'
5244,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5245,'TIGER-TIGER!','There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But
5246,'TIGER-TIGER!',"news is always good. I am tired to-night,--very tired with new"
5247,'TIGER-TIGER!',"things, Gray Brother,--but bring me the news always.'"
5248,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5249,'TIGER-TIGER!','Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee
5250,'TIGER-TIGER!',"forget?' said Gray Brother, anxiously."
5251,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5252,'TIGER-TIGER!','Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave;
5253,'TIGER-TIGER!',but also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the
5254,'TIGER-TIGER!',Pack.'
5255,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5256,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'And that thou may'st be cast out of another pack. Men are only men,"
5257,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond."
5258,'TIGER-TIGER!',"When I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at"
5259,'TIGER-TIGER!',the edge of the grazing-ground.'
5260,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5261,'TIGER-TIGER!',For three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village
5262,'TIGER-TIGER!',"gate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he"
5263,'TIGER-TIGER!',"had to wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then"
5264,'TIGER-TIGER!',"he had to learn about money, which he did not in the least"
5265,'TIGER-TIGER!',"understand, and about ploughing, of which he did not see the use."
5266,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Then the little children in the village made him very angry. Luckily,"
5267,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the Law of the Jungle had taught him to keep his temper, for in the"
5268,'TIGER-TIGER!',"jungle, life and food depend on keeping your temper; but when they"
5269,'TIGER-TIGER!',"made fun of him because he would not play games or fly kites, or"
5270,'TIGER-TIGER!',"because he mispronounced some word, only the knowledge that it was"
5271,'TIGER-TIGER!',unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him from picking them
5272,'TIGER-TIGER!',up and breaking them in two. He did not know his own strength in the
5273,'TIGER-TIGER!',"least. In the jungle he knew he was weak compared with the beasts,"
5274,'TIGER-TIGER!',"but in the village, people said that he was as strong as a bull. He"
5275,'TIGER-TIGER!',"certainly had no notion of what fear was, for when the village priest"
5276,'TIGER-TIGER!',told him that the god in the temple would be angry with him if he ate
5277,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the priest's mangoes, he picked up the image, brought it over to the"
5278,'TIGER-TIGER!',"priest's house, and asked the priest to make the god angry and he"
5279,'TIGER-TIGER!',"would be happy to fight him. It was a horrible scandal, but the"
5280,'TIGER-TIGER!',"priest hushed it up, and Messua's husband paid much good silver to"
5281,'TIGER-TIGER!',comfort the god. And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the
5282,'TIGER-TIGER!',difference that caste makes between man and man. When the potter's
5283,'TIGER-TIGER!',"donkey slipped in the clay-pit, Mowgli hauled it out by the tail, and"
5284,'TIGER-TIGER!',helped to stack the pots for their journey to the market at
5285,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for the potter is a"
5286,'TIGER-TIGER!',"low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the priest scolded him,"
5287,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey, too, and the priest told"
5288,'TIGER-TIGER!',Messua's husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as soon as
5289,'TIGER-TIGER!',possible; and the village headman told Mowgli that he would have to
5290,'TIGER-TIGER!',"go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they grazed."
5291,'TIGER-TIGER!',"No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he had"
5292,'TIGER-TIGER!',"been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off to a"
5293,'TIGER-TIGER!',circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great
5294,'TIGER-TIGER!',"fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman"
5295,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and the barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old"
5296,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Buldeo, the village hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked."
5297,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The monkeys sat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a"
5298,'TIGER-TIGER!',"hole under the platform where a cobra lived, and he had his little"
5299,'TIGER-TIGER!',platter of milk every night because he was sacred; and the old men
5300,'TIGER-TIGER!',"sat around the tree and talked, and pulled at the big _huqas_ (the"
5301,'TIGER-TIGER!',water-pipes) till far into the night. They told wonderful tales of
5302,'TIGER-TIGER!',gods and men and ghosts; and Buldeo told even more wonderful ones of
5303,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the ways of beasts in the jungle, till the eyes of the children"
5304,'TIGER-TIGER!',sitting outside the circle bulged out of their heads. Most of the
5305,'TIGER-TIGER!',"tales were about animals, for the jungle was always at their door."
5306,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops, and now and again"
5307,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within sight of the village"
5308,'TIGER-TIGER!',gates.
5309,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5310,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of,"
5311,'TIGER-TIGER!',"had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo,"
5312,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful"
5313,'TIGER-TIGER!',"story to another, and Mowgli's shoulders shook."
5314,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5315,'TIGER-TIGER!',Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua's
5316,'TIGER-TIGER!',"son was a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a"
5317,'TIGER-TIGER!',"wicked, old money-lender, who had died some years ago. 'And I know"
5318,'TIGER-TIGER!',"that this is true,' he said, 'because Purun Dass always limped from"
5319,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the blow that he got in a riot when his account-books were burned,"
5320,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and the tiger that I speak of _he_ limps, too, for the tracks of his"
5321,'TIGER-TIGER!',pads are unequal.'
5322,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5323,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'True, true, that must be the truth,' said the graybeards, nodding"
5324,'TIGER-TIGER!',together.
5325,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5326,'TIGER-TIGER!','Are all these tales such cobwebs and moontalk?' said Mowgli. 'That
5327,'TIGER-TIGER!',"tiger limps because he was born lame, as every one knows. To talk of"
5328,'TIGER-TIGER!',the soul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a
5329,'TIGER-TIGER!',jackal is child's talk.'
5330,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5331,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man"
5332,'TIGER-TIGER!',stared.
5333,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5334,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?' said Buldeo. 'If thou art so"
5335,'TIGER-TIGER!',"wise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set"
5336,'TIGER-TIGER!',"a hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders"
5337,'TIGER-TIGER!',speak.'
5338,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5339,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli rose to go. 'All the evening I have lain here listening,' he"
5340,'TIGER-TIGER!',"called back, over his shoulder, 'and, except once or twice, Buldeo"
5341,'TIGER-TIGER!',"has not said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his"
5342,'TIGER-TIGER!',"very doors. How then shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods,"
5343,'TIGER-TIGER!',and goblins which he says he has seen?'
5344,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5345,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'It is full time that boy went to herding,' said the headman, while"
5346,'TIGER-TIGER!',Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli's impertinence.
5347,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5348,'TIGER-TIGER!',The custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the
5349,'TIGER-TIGER!',"cattle and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring"
5350,'TIGER-TIGER!',them back at night; and the very cattle that would trample a white
5351,'TIGER-TIGER!',man to death allow themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at
5352,'TIGER-TIGER!',by children that hardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys
5353,'TIGER-TIGER!',"keep with the herds they are safe, for not even the tiger will charge"
5354,'TIGER-TIGER!',a mob of cattle. But if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt
5355,'TIGER-TIGER!',"lizards, they are sometimes carried off. Mowgli went through the"
5356,'TIGER-TIGER!',"village street in the dawn, sitting on the back of Rama, the great"
5357,'TIGER-TIGER!',"herd bull; and the slaty-blue buffaloes, with their long,"
5358,'TIGER-TIGER!',"backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out of their byres, one"
5359,'TIGER-TIGER!',"by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to the"
5360,'TIGER-TIGER!',children with him that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with
5361,'TIGER-TIGER!',"a long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze"
5362,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the cattle by themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to"
5363,'TIGER-TIGER!',be very careful not to stray away from the herd.
5364,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5365,'TIGER-TIGER!',"An Indian grazing-ground is all rocks, and scrubs, and tussocks, and"
5366,'TIGER-TIGER!',"little ravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The"
5367,'TIGER-TIGER!',"buffaloes generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they"
5368,'TIGER-TIGER!',lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them
5369,'TIGER-TIGER!',on to the edge of the plain where the Waingunga came out of the
5370,'TIGER-TIGER!',"jungle; then he dropped from Rama's neck, trotted off to a bamboo"
5371,'TIGER-TIGER!',"clump and found Gray Brother. 'Ah,' said Gray Brother, 'I have waited"
5372,'TIGER-TIGER!',here very many days. What is the meaning of this cattle-herding
5373,'TIGER-TIGER!',work?'
5374,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5375,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'It is an order,' said Mowgli; 'I am a village herd for a while. What"
5376,'TIGER-TIGER!',news of Shere Khan?'
5377,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5378,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time"
5379,'TIGER-TIGER!',"for thee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he"
5380,'TIGER-TIGER!',means to kill thee.'
5381,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5382,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Very good,' said Mowgli. 'So long as he is away do thou or one of"
5383,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come"
5384,'TIGER-TIGER!',out of the village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by
5385,'TIGER-TIGER!',the _dhâk_-tree in the centre of the plain. We need not walk into
5386,'TIGER-TIGER!',Shere Khan's mouth.'
5387,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5388,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Then Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while"
5389,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the buffaloes grazed round him. Herding, in India, is one of the"
5390,'TIGER-TIGER!',"laziest things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie"
5391,'TIGER-TIGER!',"down, and move on again, and they do not even low. They only grunt,"
5392,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and the buffaloes very seldom say anything, but get down into the"
5393,'TIGER-TIGER!',"muddy pools one after another, and work their way into the mud till"
5394,'TIGER-TIGER!',"only their noses and staring china-blue eyes show above the surface,"
5395,'TIGER-TIGER!',and then they lie like logs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the
5396,'TIGER-TIGER!',"heat, and the herd-children hear one kite (never any more) whistling"
5397,'TIGER-TIGER!',"almost out of sight overhead, and they know that if they died, or a"
5398,'TIGER-TIGER!',"cow died, that kite would sweep down, and the next kite miles away"
5399,'TIGER-TIGER!',"would see him drop and follow, and the next, and the next, and"
5400,'TIGER-TIGER!',almost before they were dead there would be a score of hungry kites
5401,'TIGER-TIGER!',"come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and wake and sleep again, and"
5402,'TIGER-TIGER!',"weave little baskets of dried grass and put grasshoppers in them, or"
5403,'TIGER-TIGER!',catch two praying mantises and make them fight; or string a necklace
5404,'TIGER-TIGER!',"of red and black jungle-nuts, or watch a lizard basking on a rock, or"
5405,'TIGER-TIGER!',"a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they sing long, long"
5406,'TIGER-TIGER!',"songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and the day seems"
5407,'TIGER-TIGER!',"longer than most people's whole lives, and perhaps they make a mud"
5408,'TIGER-TIGER!',"castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and put"
5409,'TIGER-TIGER!',"reeds into the men's hands, and pretend that they are kings and the"
5410,'TIGER-TIGER!',"figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshipped."
5411,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Then evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up"
5412,'TIGER-TIGER!',out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after
5413,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the other, and they all string across the gray plain back to the"
5414,'TIGER-TIGER!',twinkling village lights.
5415,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5416,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Day after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows,"
5417,'TIGER-TIGER!',and day after day he would see Gray Brother's back a mile and a half
5418,'TIGER-TIGER!',"away across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back),"
5419,'TIGER-TIGER!',and day after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises
5420,'TIGER-TIGER!',"round him, and dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had"
5421,'TIGER-TIGER!',made a false step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the
5422,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Waingunga, Mowgli would have heard him in those long still mornings."
5423,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5424,'TIGER-TIGER!',At last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal
5425,'TIGER-TIGER!',"place, and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the"
5426,'TIGER-TIGER!',"_dhâk_-tree, which was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat"
5427,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Gray Brother, every bristle on his back lifted."
5428,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5429,'TIGER-TIGER!','He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He crossed
5430,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the ranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail,' said the"
5431,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Wolf, panting."
5432,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5433,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli frowned. 'I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very"
5434,'TIGER-TIGER!',cunning.'
5435,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5436,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Have no fear,' said Gray Brother, licking his lips a little. 'I met"
5437,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Tabaqui in the dawn. Now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites,"
5438,'TIGER-TIGER!',but he told _me_ everything before I broke his back. Shere Khan's
5439,'TIGER-TIGER!',plan is to wait for thee at the village gate this evening--for thee
5440,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and for no one else. He is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of the"
5441,'TIGER-TIGER!',Waingunga.'
5442,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5443,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Has he eaten to-day, or does he hunt empty?' said Mowgli, for the"
5444,'TIGER-TIGER!',answer meant life and death to him.
5445,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5446,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'He killed at dawn--a pig--and he has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan"
5447,'TIGER-TIGER!',"could never fast, even for the sake of revenge.'"
5448,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5449,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Oh! fool, fool! What a cub's cub it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he"
5450,'TIGER-TIGER!',"thinks that I shall wait till he has slept! Now, where does he lie"
5451,'TIGER-TIGER!',up? If there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies.
5452,'TIGER-TIGER!',"These buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot"
5453,'TIGER-TIGER!',speak their language. Can we get behind his track so that they may
5454,'TIGER-TIGER!',smell it?'
5455,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5456,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'He swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off,' said Gray Brother."
5457,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5458,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Tabaqui told him that, I know. He would never have thought of it"
5459,'TIGER-TIGER!',"alone.' Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth, thinking. 'The big"
5460,'TIGER-TIGER!',ravine of the Waingunga. That opens out on the plain not half a mile
5461,'TIGER-TIGER!',from here. I can take the herd round through the jungle to the head
5462,'TIGER-TIGER!',of the ravine and then sweep down--but he would slink out at the
5463,'TIGER-TIGER!',"foot. We must block that end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd"
5464,'TIGER-TIGER!',in two for me?'
5465,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5466,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.' Gray Brother"
5467,'TIGER-TIGER!',trotted off and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray
5468,'TIGER-TIGER!',"head that Mowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most"
5469,'TIGER-TIGER!',desolate cry of all the jungle--the hunting-howl of a wolf at
5470,'TIGER-TIGER!',mid-day.
5471,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5472,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Akela! Akela!' said Mowgli, clapping his hands. 'I might have known"
5473,'TIGER-TIGER!',that thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand. Cut the
5474,'TIGER-TIGER!',"herd in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls"
5475,'TIGER-TIGER!',and the plough-buffaloes by themselves.'
5476,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5477,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The two wolves ran, ladies'-chain fashion, in and out of the herd,"
5478,'TIGER-TIGER!',"which snorted and threw up its head, and separated into two clumps."
5479,'TIGER-TIGER!',"In one, the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the centre, and"
5480,'TIGER-TIGER!',"glared and pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge"
5481,'TIGER-TIGER!',"down and trample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the"
5482,'TIGER-TIGER!',"young bulls snorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing"
5483,'TIGER-TIGER!',"they were much less dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No"
5484,'TIGER-TIGER!',six men could have divided the herd so neatly.
5485,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5486,'TIGER-TIGER!','What orders!' panted Akela. 'They are trying to join again.'
5487,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5488,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli slipped on to Rama's back. 'Drive the bulls away to the left,"
5489,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Akela. Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and"
5490,'TIGER-TIGER!',drive them into the foot of the ravine.'
5491,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5492,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'How far?' said Gray Brother, panting and snapping."
5493,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5494,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Till the sides are higher than Shere Khan can jump,' shouted Mowgli."
5495,'TIGER-TIGER!','Keep them there till we come down.' The bulls swept off as Akela
5496,'TIGER-TIGER!',"bayed, and Gray Brother stopped in front of the cows. They charged"
5497,'TIGER-TIGER!',"down on him, and he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine,"
5498,'TIGER-TIGER!',as Akela drove the bulls far to the left.
5499,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5500,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Well done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful,"
5501,'TIGER-TIGER!',"now--careful, Akela. A snap too much, and the bulls will charge."
5502,'TIGER-TIGER!',_Hujah!_ This is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou
5503,'TIGER-TIGER!',think these creatures could move so swiftly?' Mowgli called.
5504,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5505,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'I have--have hunted these too in my time,' gasped Akela in the dust."
5506,'TIGER-TIGER!','Shall I turn them into the jungle?'
5507,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5508,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could"
5509,'TIGER-TIGER!',only tell him what I need of him today.'
5510,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5511,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the"
5512,'TIGER-TIGER!',"standing thicket. The other herd-children, watching with the cattle"
5513,'TIGER-TIGER!',"half a mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could"
5514,'TIGER-TIGER!',"carry them, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away. But"
5515,'TIGER-TIGER!',Mowgli's plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do was to make a
5516,'TIGER-TIGER!',"big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take"
5517,'TIGER-TIGER!',the bulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the
5518,'TIGER-TIGER!',cows; for he knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan
5519,'TIGER-TIGER!',would not be in any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of
5520,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the ravine. He was soothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had"
5521,'TIGER-TIGER!',"dropped far to the rear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the"
5522,'TIGER-TIGER!',"rear-guard. It was a long, long circle, for they did not wish to get"
5523,'TIGER-TIGER!',too near the ravine and give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli
5524,'TIGER-TIGER!',rounded up the bewildered herd at the head of the ravine on a grassy
5525,'TIGER-TIGER!',patch that sloped steeply down to the ravine itself. From that height
5526,'TIGER-TIGER!',you could see across the tops of the trees down to the plain below;
5527,'TIGER-TIGER!',"but what Mowgli looked at was the sides of the ravine, and he saw"
5528,'TIGER-TIGER!',with a great deal of satisfaction that they ran nearly straight up
5529,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and down, while the vines and creepers that hung over them would give"
5530,'TIGER-TIGER!',no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.
5531,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5532,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Let them breathe, Akela,' he said, holding up his hand. 'They have"
5533,'TIGER-TIGER!',not winded him yet. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We have him in
5534,'TIGER-TIGER!',a trap.'
5535,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5536,'TIGER-TIGER!',"He put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine,--it was"
5537,'TIGER-TIGER!',"almost like shouting down a tunnel,--and the echoes jumped from rock"
5538,'TIGER-TIGER!',to rock.
5539,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5540,'TIGER-TIGER!',"After a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a"
5541,'TIGER-TIGER!',full-fed tiger just wakened.
5542,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5543,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Who calls?' said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out"
5544,'TIGER-TIGER!',of the ravine screeching.
5545,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5546,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!"
5547,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Down--hurry them down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!'"
5548,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5549,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela"
5550,'TIGER-TIGER!',"gave tongue in the full hunting yell, and they pitched over one after"
5551,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the other just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting"
5552,'TIGER-TIGER!',"up round them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and"
5553,'TIGER-TIGER!',before they were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere
5554,'TIGER-TIGER!',Khan and bellowed.
5555,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5556,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Ha! Ha!' said Mowgli, on his back. 'Now thou knowest!' and the"
5557,'TIGER-TIGER!',"torrent of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled"
5558,'TIGER-TIGER!',down the ravine just as boulders go down in flood-time; the weaker
5559,'TIGER-TIGER!',buffaloes being shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they
5560,'TIGER-TIGER!',tore through the creepers. They knew what the business was before
5561,'TIGER-TIGER!',them--the terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger
5562,'TIGER-TIGER!',"can hope to stand. Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs,"
5563,'TIGER-TIGER!',"picked himself up and lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to"
5564,'TIGER-TIGER!',"side for some way of escape, but the walls of the ravine were"
5565,'TIGER-TIGER!',"straight and he had to hold on, heavy with his dinner and drink,"
5566,'TIGER-TIGER!',willing to do anything rather than fight. The herd splashed through
5567,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the pool he had just left, bellowing till the narrow cut rang. Mowgli"
5568,'TIGER-TIGER!',"heard an answering bellow from the foot of the ravine, saw Shere Khan"
5569,'TIGER-TIGER!',turn (the tiger knew if the worst came to the worst it was better to
5570,'TIGER-TIGER!',"meet the bulls than the cows with their calves), and then Rama"
5571,'TIGER-TIGER!',"tripped, and stumbled, and went on again over something soft, and,"
5572,'TIGER-TIGER!',"with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the other herd, while"
5573,'TIGER-TIGER!',the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by the shock of
5574,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the plain,"
5575,'TIGER-TIGER!',"goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and"
5576,'TIGER-TIGER!',"slipped off Rama's neck, laying about right and left with his stick."
5577,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5578,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Quick, Akela! Break them up. Scatter them, or they will be fighting"
5579,'TIGER-TIGER!',"one another. Drive them away, Akela. _Hai_, Rama! _Hai! hai! hai!_ my"
5580,'TIGER-TIGER!',"children. Softly now, softly! It is all over.'"
5581,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5582,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Akela and Gray Brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes' legs,"
5583,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again,"
5584,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli managed to turn Rama, and the others followed him to the"
5585,'TIGER-TIGER!',wallows.
5586,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5587,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were"
5588,'TIGER-TIGER!',coming for him already.
5589,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5590,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Brothers, that was a dog's death,' said Mowgli, feeling for the"
5591,'TIGER-TIGER!',knife he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived
5592,'TIGER-TIGER!',with men. 'But he would never have shown fight. _Wallah!_ his hide
5593,'TIGER-TIGER!',will look well on the Council Rock. We must get to work swiftly.'
5594,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5595,'TIGER-TIGER!',A boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a
5596,'TIGER-TIGER!',"ten-foot tiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than any one else how an"
5597,'TIGER-TIGER!',"animal's skin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was"
5598,'TIGER-TIGER!',"hard work, and Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while"
5599,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the wolves lolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he"
5600,'TIGER-TIGER!',"ordered them. Presently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up"
5601,'TIGER-TIGER!',he saw Buldeo with the Tower musket. The children had told the
5602,'TIGER-TIGER!',"village about the buffalo stampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only"
5603,'TIGER-TIGER!',too anxious to correct Mowgli for not taking better care of the herd.
5604,'TIGER-TIGER!',The wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw the man coming.
5605,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5606,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'What is this folly? said Buldeo, angrily. 'To think that thou canst"
5607,'TIGER-TIGER!',"skin a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger,"
5608,'TIGER-TIGER!',"too, and there is a hundred rupees on his head. Well, well, we will"
5609,'TIGER-TIGER!',"overlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee"
5610,'TIGER-TIGER!',one of the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to
5611,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Khanhiwara. He fumbled in his waist-cloth for flint and steel, and"
5612,'TIGER-TIGER!',stooped down to singe Shere Khan's whiskers. Most native hunters
5613,'TIGER-TIGER!',always singe a tiger's whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting
5614,'TIGER-TIGER!',them.
5615,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5616,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Hum!' said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a"
5617,'TIGER-TIGER!',"forepaw. 'So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward,"
5618,'TIGER-TIGER!',and perhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the
5619,'TIGER-TIGER!',"skin for my own use. Heh! old man, take away that fire!'"
5620,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5621,'TIGER-TIGER!','What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and
5622,'TIGER-TIGER!',the stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill. The
5623,'TIGER-TIGER!',"tiger has just fed, or he would have gone twenty miles by this time."
5624,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Thou canst not even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and"
5625,'TIGER-TIGER!',"forsooth I, Buldeo, must be told not to singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I"
5626,'TIGER-TIGER!',"will not give thee one anna of the reward, but only a very big"
5627,'TIGER-TIGER!',beating. Leave the carcass!'
5628,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5629,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'By the Bull that bought me,' said Mowgli, who was trying to get at"
5630,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the shoulder, 'must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here,"
5631,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Akela, this man plagues me.'"
5632,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5633,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan's head, found himself"
5634,'TIGER-TIGER!',"sprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while"
5635,'TIGER-TIGER!',Mowgli went on skinning as though he were alone in all India.
5636,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5637,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Ye-es,' he said, between his teeth. 'Thou art altogether right,"
5638,'TIGER-TIGER!',Buldeo. Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an
5639,'TIGER-TIGER!',"old war between this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I"
5640,'TIGER-TIGER!',have won.'
5641,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5642,'TIGER-TIGER!',"To do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have"
5643,'TIGER-TIGER!',"taken his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a"
5644,'TIGER-TIGER!',wolf who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with
5645,'TIGER-TIGER!',"man-eating tigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of"
5646,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the worst kind, thought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet"
5647,'TIGER-TIGER!',"round his neck would protect him. He lay as still as still, expecting"
5648,'TIGER-TIGER!',"every minute to see Mowgli turn into a tiger, too."
5649,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5650,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Maharaj! Great King,' he said at last, in a husky whisper."
5651,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5652,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Yes,' said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little."
5653,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5654,'TIGER-TIGER!','I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a
5655,'TIGER-TIGER!',"herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to"
5656,'TIGER-TIGER!',pieces?'
5657,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5658,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my"
5659,'TIGER-TIGER!',"game. Let him go, Akela.'"
5660,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5661,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back"
5662,'TIGER-TIGER!',over his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something
5663,'TIGER-TIGER!',terrible. When he got to the village he told a tale of magic and
5664,'TIGER-TIGER!',enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave.
5665,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5666,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he"
5667,'TIGER-TIGER!',and the wolves had drawn the great gray skin clear of the body.
5668,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5669,'TIGER-TIGER!','Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me to herd
5670,'TIGER-TIGER!',"them, Akela.'"
5671,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5672,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The herd rounded up in the misty twilight, and when they got near the"
5673,'TIGER-TIGER!',"village Mowgli saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the"
5674,'TIGER-TIGER!',temple blowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be waiting for
5675,'TIGER-TIGER!',"him by the gate. 'That is because I have killed Shere Khan,' he said"
5676,'TIGER-TIGER!',"to himself; but a shower of stones whistled about his ears, and the"
5677,'TIGER-TIGER!',villagers shouted: 'Sorcerer! Wolfs brat! Jungle-demon! Go away! Get
5678,'TIGER-TIGER!',"hence quickly, or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. Shoot,"
5679,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Buldeo, shoot!'"
5680,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5681,'TIGER-TIGER!',"The old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo"
5682,'TIGER-TIGER!',bellowed in pain.
5683,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5684,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'More sorcery!' shouted the villagers. 'He can turn bullets. Buldeo,"
5685,'TIGER-TIGER!',that was _thy_ buffalo.'
5686,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5687,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Now what is this?' said. Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew"
5688,'TIGER-TIGER!',thicker.
5689,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5690,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'They are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine,' said Akela,"
5691,'TIGER-TIGER!',"sitting down composedly. 'It is in my head that, if bullets mean"
5692,'TIGER-TIGER!',"anything, they would cast thee out.'"
5693,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5694,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Wolf! Wolf's cub! Go away!' shouted the priest, waving a sprig of"
5695,'TIGER-TIGER!',the sacred _tulsi_ plant.
5696,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5697,'TIGER-TIGER!','Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because
5698,'TIGER-TIGER!',"I am a wolf. Let us go, Akela.'"
5699,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5700,'TIGER-TIGER!',"A woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: 'Oh, my"
5701,'TIGER-TIGER!',"son, my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a"
5702,'TIGER-TIGER!',"beast at will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee."
5703,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Buldeo says thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo's"
5704,'TIGER-TIGER!',death.'
5705,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5706,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Come back, Messua!' shouted the crowd. 'Come back, or we will stone"
5707,'TIGER-TIGER!',thee.'
5708,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5709,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in"
5710,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the mouth. 'Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales they"
5711,'TIGER-TIGER!',tell under the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy son's
5712,'TIGER-TIGER!',"life. Farewell; and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more"
5713,'TIGER-TIGER!',"swiftly than their brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!'"
5714,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5715,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Now, once more, Akela,' he cried. 'Bring the herd in.'"
5716,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5717,'TIGER-TIGER!',The buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly
5718,'TIGER-TIGER!',"needed Akela's yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind,"
5719,'TIGER-TIGER!',scattering the crowd right and left.
5720,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5721,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Keep count!' shouted Mowgli, scornfully. 'It may be that I have"
5722,'TIGER-TIGER!',"stolen one of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more."
5723,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Fare you well, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come"
5724,'TIGER-TIGER!',in with my wolves and hunt you up and down your street.'
5725,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5726,'TIGER-TIGER!',He turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf; and as he
5727,'TIGER-TIGER!',looked up at the stars he felt happy. 'No more sleeping in traps for
5728,'TIGER-TIGER!',"me, Akela. Let us get Shere Khan's skin and go away. No; we will not"
5729,'TIGER-TIGER!',"hurt the village, for Messua was kind to me.'"
5730,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5731,'TIGER-TIGER!',"When the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the"
5732,'TIGER-TIGER!',"horrified villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his heels and a"
5733,'TIGER-TIGER!',"bundle on his head, trotting across at the steady wolf's trot that"
5734,'TIGER-TIGER!',eats up the long miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells
5735,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and blew the conches louder than ever; and Messua cried, and Buldeo"
5736,'TIGER-TIGER!',"embroidered the story of his adventures in the jungle, till he ended"
5737,'TIGER-TIGER!',by saying that Akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man.
5738,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5739,'TIGER-TIGER!',The moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to
5740,'TIGER-TIGER!',"the hill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf's cave."
5741,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5742,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'They have cast me out from the man Pack, Mother,' shouted Mowgli,"
5743,'TIGER-TIGER!','but I come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.' Mother Wolf
5744,'TIGER-TIGER!',"walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and her eyes"
5745,'TIGER-TIGER!',glowed as she saw the skin.
5746,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5747,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'I told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into"
5748,'TIGER-TIGER!',"this cave, hunting for thy life, little frog--I told him that the"
5749,'TIGER-TIGER!',hunter would be the hunted. It is well done.'
5750,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5751,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Little Brother, it is well done,' said a deep voice in the thicket."
5752,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'We were lonely in the jungle without thee,' and Bagheera came"
5753,'TIGER-TIGER!',running to Mowgli's bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock
5754,'TIGER-TIGER!',"together, and Mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where"
5755,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Akela used to sit, and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo,"
5756,'TIGER-TIGER!',"and Akela lay down upon it, and called the old call to the Council,"
5757,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Look, look well, O Wolves,' exactly as he had called when Mowgli"
5758,'TIGER-TIGER!',was first brought there.
5759,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5760,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Ever since Akela had been deposed, the Pack had been without a"
5761,'TIGER-TIGER!',"leader, hunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they"
5762,'TIGER-TIGER!',answered the call from habit; and some of them were lame from the
5763,'TIGER-TIGER!',"traps they had fallen into, and some limped from shot-wounds, and"
5764,'TIGER-TIGER!',"some were mangy from eating bad food, and many were missing; but they"
5765,'TIGER-TIGER!',"came to the Council Rock, all that were left of them, and saw Shere"
5766,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Khan's striped hide on the rock, and the huge claws dangling at the"
5767,'TIGER-TIGER!',end of the empty dangling feet.
5768,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5769,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept my word?' said Mowgli; and the"
5770,'TIGER-TIGER!',"wolves bayed Yes, and one tattered wolf howled:--"
5771,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5772,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Lead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O man-cub, for we be sick of"
5773,'TIGER-TIGER!',"this lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more.'"
5774,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5775,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Nay,' purred Bagheera, 'that may not be. When ye are full fed, the"
5776,'TIGER-TIGER!',madness may come upon you again. Not for nothing are ye called the
5777,'TIGER-TIGER!',"Free People. Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O"
5778,'TIGER-TIGER!',Wolves.'
5779,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5780,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'Man-Pack and Wolf-Pack have cast me out,' said Mowgli. 'Now I will"
5781,'TIGER-TIGER!',hunt alone in the jungle.'
5782,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5783,'TIGER-TIGER!',"'And we will hunt with thee,' said the four cubs."
5784,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5785,'TIGER-TIGER!',So Mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from
5786,'TIGER-TIGER!',"that day on. But he was not always alone, because, years afterward,"
5787,'TIGER-TIGER!',he became a man and married.
5788,'TIGER-TIGER!',
5789,'TIGER-TIGER!',But that is a story for grown-ups.

5866,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Now Tods' Mamma was a singularly charming woman, and every one in"
5867,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Simla knew Tods. Most men had saved him from death on occasions. He
5868,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"was beyond his _ayah's_ control altogether, and perilled his life"
5869,TODS' AMENDMENT.,daily to find out what would happen if you pulled a Mountain Battery
5870,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"mule's tail. He was an utterly fearless young Pagan, about six years"
5871,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"old, and the only baby who ever broke the holy calm of the Supreme"
5872,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Legislative Council.
5873,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5874,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"It happened this way: Tods' pet kid got loose, and fled up the hill,"
5875,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"off the Boileaugunge Road, Tods after it, until it burst in to the"
5876,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Viceregal Lodge lawn, then attached to 'Peterhoff.' The Council were"
5877,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"sitting at the time, and the windows were open because it was warm."
5878,TODS' AMENDMENT.,The Red Lancer in the porch told Tods to go away; but Tods knew the
5879,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Red Lancer and most of the Members of Council personally. Moreover,"
5880,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"he had firm hold of the kid's collar, and was being dragged all"
5881,TODS' AMENDMENT.,across the flower-beds. 'Give my _salaam_ to the long Councillor
5882,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_Sahib_, and ask him to help me take _Moti_ back!' gasped Tods. The"
5883,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Council heard the noise through the open windows; and, after an"
5884,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"interval, was seen the shocking spectacle of a Legal Member and a"
5885,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Lieutenant-Governor helping, under the direct patronage of a"
5886,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Commander-in-Chief and a Viceroy, one small and very dirty boy, in a"
5887,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"sailor's suit and a tangle of brown hair, to coerce a lively and"
5888,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"rebellious kid. They headed it off down the path to the Mall, and"
5889,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Tods went home in triumph and told his Mamma that _all_ the
5890,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Councillor _Sahibs_ had been helping him to catch _Moti_. Whereat his
5891,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Mamma smacked Tods for interfering with the administration of the
5892,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Empire; but Tods met the Legal Member the next day, and told him in"
5893,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"confidence that if the Legal Member ever wanted to catch a goat, he,"
5894,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Tods, would give him all the help in his power. 'Thank you, Tods,'"
5895,TODS' AMENDMENT.,said the Legal Member.
5896,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5897,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Tods was the idol of some eighty _jhampanis_, and half as many"
5898,TODS' AMENDMENT.,_saises_. He saluted them all as 'O Brother.' It never entered his
5899,TODS' AMENDMENT.,head that any living human being could disobey his orders; and he was
5900,TODS' AMENDMENT.,the buffer between the servants and his Mamma's wrath. The working of
5901,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"that household turned on Tods, who was adored by every one from the"
5902,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_dhoby_ to the dog-boy. Even Futteh Khan, the villainous loafer"
5903,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_khit_ from Mussoorie, shirked risking Tods' displeasure for fear his"
5904,TODS' AMENDMENT.,co-mates should look down on him.
5905,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5906,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"So Tods had honour in the land from Boileaugunge to Chota Simla, and"
5907,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"ruled justly according to his lights. Of course, he spoke Urdu, but"
5908,TODS' AMENDMENT.,he had also mastered many queer side-speeches like the _chotee bolee_
5909,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"of the women, and held grave converse with shopkeepers and"
5910,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Hill-coolies alike. He was precocious for his age, and his mixing"
5911,TODS' AMENDMENT.,with natives had taught him some of the more bitter truths of life:
5912,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the meanness and the sordidness of it. He used, over his bread and"
5913,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"milk, to deliver solemn and serious aphorisms, translated from the"
5914,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"vernacular into the English, that made his Mamma jump and vow that"
5915,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Tods _must_ go Home next hot weather. Just when Tods was in the bloom
5916,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"of his power, the Supreme Legislature were hacking out a Bill for the"
5917,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Sub-Montane Tracts, a revision of the then Act, smaller than the"
5918,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Punjab Land Bill, but affecting a few hundred thousand people none"
5919,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the less. The Legal Member had built, and bolstered, and embroidered,"
5920,TODS' AMENDMENT.,and amended that Bill till it looked beautiful on paper. Then the
5921,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Council began to settle what they called the 'minor details.' As if
5922,TODS' AMENDMENT.,any Englishman legislating for natives knows enough to know which are
5923,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the minor and which are the major points, from the native point of"
5924,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"view, of any measure! That Bill was a triumph of 'safe-guarding the"
5925,TODS' AMENDMENT.,interests of the tenant.' One clause provided that land should not be
5926,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch; because, if the"
5927,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"landlord had a tenant bound down for, say, twenty years, he would"
5928,TODS' AMENDMENT.,squeeze the very life out of him. The notion was to keep up a stream
5929,TODS' AMENDMENT.,of independent cultivators in the Sub-Montane Tracts; and
5930,TODS' AMENDMENT.,ethnologically and politically the notion was correct. The only
5931,TODS' AMENDMENT.,drawback was that it was altogether wrong. A native's life in India
5932,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"implies the life of his son. Wherefore, you cannot legislate for one"
5933,TODS' AMENDMENT.,generation at a time. You must consider the next from the native
5934,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"point of view. Curiously enough, the native now and then, and in"
5935,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Northern India more particularly, hates being over-protected against"
5936,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"himself. There was a Naga Village once, where they lived on dead"
5937,TODS' AMENDMENT.,_and_ buried Commissariat mules.... But that is another story.
5938,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5939,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"For many reasons, to be explained later, the people concerned"
5940,TODS' AMENDMENT.,objected to the Bill. The Native Member in Council knew as much about
5941,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Punjabis as he knew about Charing Cross. He had said in Calcutta that
5942,TODS' AMENDMENT.,'the Bill was entirely in accord with the desires of that large and
5943,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"important class, the cultivators'; and so on, and so on. The Legal"
5944,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Member's knowledge of natives was limited to English-speaking
5945,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Durbaris, and his own red _chaprassis_, the Sub-Montane Tracts"
5946,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"concerned no one in particular, the Deputy Commissioners were a good"
5947,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"deal too driven to make representations, and the measure was one"
5948,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"which dealt with small land-holders only. Nevertheless, the Legal"
5949,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Member prayed that it might be correct, for he was a nervously"
5950,TODS' AMENDMENT.,conscientious man. He did not know that no man can tell what natives
5951,TODS' AMENDMENT.,think unless he mixes with them with the varnish off. And not always
5952,TODS' AMENDMENT.,then. But he did the best he knew. And the measure came up to the
5953,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Supreme Council for the final touches, while Tods patrolled the Burra"
5954,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Simla Bazar in his morning rides, and played with the monkey"
5955,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"belonging to Ditta Mull, the _bunnia_, and listened, as a child"
5956,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"listens, to all the stray talk about this new freak of the _Lord"
5957,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Sahib's_.
5958,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5959,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"One day there was a dinner-party at the house of Tods' Mamma, and the"
5960,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Legal Member came. Tods was in bed, but he kept awake till he heard"
5961,TODS' AMENDMENT.,the bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee. Then he paddled
5962,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"out in his little red flannel dressing-gown and his night-suit, and"
5963,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"took refuge by the side of his father, knowing that he would not be"
5964,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"sent back. 'See the miseries of having a family!' said Tods' father,"
5965,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"giving Tods three prunes, some water in a glass that had been used"
5966,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"for claret, and telling him to sit still. Tods sucked the prunes"
5967,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"slowly, knowing that he would have to go when they were finished,"
5968,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"and sipped the pink water like a man of the world, as he listened to"
5969,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the conversation. Presently, the Legal Member, talking 'shop' to the"
5970,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Head of a Department, mentioned his Bill by its full name--'The"
5971,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Sub-Montane Tracts _Ryotwary_ Revised Enactment.' Tods caught the one
5972,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"native word, and lifting up his small voice said--"
5973,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5974,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'Oh, I know _all_ about that! Has it been _murramutted_ yet,"
5975,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Councillor _Sahib_?'
5976,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5977,TODS' AMENDMENT.,'How much?' said the Legal Member. '_Murramutted_--mended.--Put
5978,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_theek_, you  know--made nice to please Ditta Mull!'"
5979,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5980,TODS' AMENDMENT.,The Legal Member left his place and moved up next to Tods.
5981,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5982,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'What do you know about _ryotwari_, little man?' he said."
5983,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5984,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'I'm not a little man, I'm Tods, and I know _all_ about it. Ditta"
5985,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Mull, and Choga Lall, and Amir Nath, and--oh, _lakhs_ of my friends"
5986,TODS' AMENDMENT.,tell me about it in the bazars when I talk to them.'
5987,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5988,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'Oh, they do--do they? What do they say, Tods?'"
5989,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5990,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressing-gown and said--'I
5991,TODS' AMENDMENT.,must _fink_.'
5992,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5993,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"The Legal Member waited patiently. Then Tods, with infinite"
5994,TODS' AMENDMENT.,compassion--
5995,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5996,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'You don't speak my talk, do you, Councillor _Sahib_?'"
5997,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
5998,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'No;   I  am  sorry  to  say I  do  not,' said the Legal Member."
5999,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6000,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'Very well,' said Tods, 'I must _fink_ in English.'"
6001,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6002,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"He spent a minute putting his ideas in order, and began very slowly,"
6003,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"translating in his mind from the vernacular to English, as many"
6004,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Anglo-Indian children do. You must remember that the Legal Member
6005,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"helped him on by questions when he halted, for Tods was not equal to"
6006,TODS' AMENDMENT.,the sustained flight of oratory that follows.
6007,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6008,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'Ditta Mull says, ""This thing is the talk of a child, and was made up"
6009,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"by fools."" But _I_ don't think you are a fool, Councillor _Sahib_,'"
6010,TODS' AMENDMENT.,said Tods hastily. 'You caught my goat. This is what Ditta Mull
6011,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"says--'I am not a fool, and why should the Sirkar say I am a child? I"
6012,TODS' AMENDMENT.,can see if the land is good and if the landlord is good. If I am a
6013,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"fool, the sin is upon my own head. For five years I take my ground"
6014,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"for which I have saved money, and a wife I take too, and a little son"
6015,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"is born."" Ditta Mull has one daughter now, but he _says_ he will have"
6016,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"a son soon. And he says, ""At the end of five years, by this new"
6017,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_bundobust_, I must go. If I do not go, I must get fresh seals and"
6018,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_takkus_-stamps on the papers, perhaps in the middle of the harvest,"
6019,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"and to go to the law-courts once is wisdom, but to go twice is"
6020,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_Jehannum_."" 'That is _quite_ true,' explained Tods gravely. 'All my"
6021,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"friends say so. And Ditta Mull says, ""Always fresh _takkus_ and"
6022,TODS' AMENDMENT.,paying money to _vakils_ and _chaprassis_ and law-courts every five
6023,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"years, or else the landlord makes me go. Why do I want to go? Am I a"
6024,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"fool? If I am a fool and do not know, after forty years, good land"
6025,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"when I see it, let me die! But if the new _bundobust_ says for"
6026,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_fifteen_ years, that is good and wise. My little son is a man, and I"
6027,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"am burnt, and he takes the ground or another ground, paying only once"
6028,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"for the _takkus_-stamps on the papers, and his little son is born,"
6029,TODS' AMENDMENT.,and at the end of fifteen years is a man too. But what profit is
6030,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"there in five years and fresh papers? Nothing but _dikh_, trouble,"
6031,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"_dikh_. We are not young men who take these lands, but old ones--not"
6032,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"farmers, but tradesmen with a little money--and for fifteen years we"
6033,TODS' AMENDMENT.,shall have peace. Nor are we children that the Sirkar should treat us
6034,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"so.""'"
6035,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6036,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Here Tods stopped short, for the whole table were listening. The"
6037,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Legal Member said to Tods, 'Is that all?'"
6038,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6039,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"'All I can remember,' said Tods. 'But you should see Ditta Mull's big"
6040,TODS' AMENDMENT.,monkey. It's just like a Councillor _Sahib_.'
6041,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6042,TODS' AMENDMENT.,'Tods! Go to bed!' said his father.
6043,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6044,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Tods gathered up his dressing-gown tail and departed. The Legal
6045,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Member brought his hand down on the table with a crash--'By Jove!'
6046,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"said the Legal Member, 'I believe the boy is right. The short"
6047,TODS' AMENDMENT.,tenure _is_ the weak point.'
6048,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6049,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"He left early, thinking over what Tods had said. Now, it was"
6050,TODS' AMENDMENT.,obviously impossible for the Legal Member to play with a _bunnia's_
6051,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"monkey, by way of getting understanding; but he did better. He made"
6052,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"inquiries, always bearing in mind the fact that the real native--not"
6053,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"the hybrid, University-trained mule--is as timid as a colt, and"
6054,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"little by little, he coaxed some of the men whom the measure"
6055,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"concerned most intimately to give in their views, which squared very"
6056,TODS' AMENDMENT.,closely with Tods' evidence.
6057,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6058,TODS' AMENDMENT.,So the Bill was amended in that clause; and the Legal Member was
6059,TODS' AMENDMENT.,filled with an uneasy suspicion that Native Members represent very
6060,TODS' AMENDMENT.,little except the Orders they carry on their bosoms. But he put the
6061,TODS' AMENDMENT.,thought from him as illiberal. He was a most liberal man.
6062,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6063,TODS' AMENDMENT.,After a time the news spread through the bazars that Tods had got the
6064,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"Bill recast in the tenure-clause, and, if Tods' Mamma had not"
6065,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"interfered, Tods would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit"
6066,TODS' AMENDMENT.,and pistachio nuts and Cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the
6067,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"verandah. Till he went Home, Tods ranked some few degrees before the"
6068,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Viceroy in popular estimation. But for the little life of him Tods
6069,TODS' AMENDMENT.,could not understand why.
6070,TODS' AMENDMENT.,
6071,TODS' AMENDMENT.,In the Legal Member's private-paper-box still lies the rough draft of
6072,TODS' AMENDMENT.,the Sub-Montane Tracts _Ryotwary_ Revised Enactment; and opposite the
6073,TODS' AMENDMENT.,"twenty-second clause, pencilled in blue chalk, and signed by the"
6074,TODS' AMENDMENT.,Legal Member are the words '_Tods' Amendment_.'

6099,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,No one would for an instant accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting to
6100,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,play with polo-balls. He carried out the battered thing into the
6101,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"verandah; and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks, a patter"
6102,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"of small feet, and the _thud-thud-thud_ of the ball rolling along"
6103,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,the ground. Evidently the little son had been waiting outside the

6114,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"He had no business in my room, of course; but was so deeply absorbed"

6118,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"knew what was coming, and fled, followed by a long, dry howl which"
6119,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,reached the servants' quarters far more quickly than any command of

6133,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"subsided into a sob. The two set off for the door. 'His name,' said"
6134,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"Imam Din, as though the name were part of the crime, 'is Muhammad"
6135,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"Din, and he is a _budmash_.' Freed from present danger, Muhammad Din"
6136,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"turned round in his father's arms, and said gravely, 'It is true that"
6137,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"my name is Muhammad Din, _Tahib_, but I am not a _budmash_. I am a"
6138,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,_man_!'
6139,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6140,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,From that day dated my acquaintance with Muhammad Din. Never again
6141,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"did he come into my dining-room, but on the neutral ground of the"
6142,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"garden we greeted each other with much state, though our conversation"
6143,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"was confined to '_Talaam, Tahib_' from his side, and '_Salaam,"
6144,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"Muhammad Din_' from mine. Daily on my return from office, the little"
6145,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,white shirt and the fat little body used to rise from the shade of
6146,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,the creeper-covered trellis where they had been hid; and daily I
6147,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"checked my horse here, that my salutation might not be slurred over"
6148,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,or given unseemly.
6149,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6150,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,Muhammad Din never had any companions. He used to trot about the
6151,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"compound, in and out of the castor-oil bushes, on mysterious errands"
6152,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,of his own. One day I stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down
6153,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"the grounds. He had half buried the polo-ball in dust, and stuck six"
6154,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it. Outside that
6155,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"circle again was a rude square, traced out in bits of red brick"
6156,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,alternating with fragments of broken china; the whole bounded by a
6157,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,little bank of dust. The water-man from the well-curb put in a plea
6158,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"for the small architect, saying that it was only the play of a baby"
6159,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,and did not much disfigure my garden.
6160,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6161,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,Heaven knows that I had no intention of touching the child's work
6162,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"then or later; but, that evening, a stroll through the garden brought"
6163,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"me unawares full on it; so that I trampled, before I knew,"
6164,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"marigold-heads, dust-bank, and fragments of broken soap dish into"
6165,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"confusion past all hope of mending. Next morning, I came upon"
6166,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,Muhammad Din crying softly to himself over the ruin I had wrought.
6167,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,Some one had cruelly told him that the _Sahib_ was very angry with
6168,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"him for spoiling the garden, and had scattered his rubbish, using bad"
6169,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,language the while. Muhammad Din laboured for an hour at effacing
6170,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"every trace of the dust bank and pottery fragments, and it was with"
6171,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"a tearful and apologetic face that he said, '_Talaam, Tahib_,' when"
6172,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,I came home from office. A hasty inquiry resulted in Imam Din
6173,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"informing Muhammad Din that, by my singular favour, he was permitted"
6174,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,to disport himself as he pleased. Whereat the child took heart and
6175,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,fell to tracing the ground-plan of an edifice which was to eclipse
6176,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,the marigold-polo-ball creation.
6177,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6178,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,For some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble
6179,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,orbit among the castor-oil bushes and in the dust; always fashioning
6180,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer,"
6181,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"smooth water-worn pebbles, bits of broken glass, and feathers pulled,"
6182,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"I fancy, from my fowls--always alone, and always crooning to himself."
6183,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6184,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,A gaily-spotted sea-shell was dropped one day close to the last of
6185,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,his little buildings; and I looked that Muhammad Din should build
6186,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,something more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it. Nor
6187,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"was I disappointed He meditated for the better part of an hour, and"
6188,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,his crooning rose to a jubilant song. Then he began tracing in the
6189,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"dust. It would certainly be a wondrous palace, this one, for it was"
6190,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,two yards long and a yard broad in ground-plan. But the palace was
6191,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,never completed.
6192,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6193,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"Next day there was no Muhammad Din at the head of the carriage-drive,"
6194,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"and no '_Talaam, Tahib_' to welcome my return. I had grown accustomed"
6195,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"to the greeting, and its omission troubled me. Next day Imam Din told"
6196,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,me that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed
6197,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"quinine. He got the medicine, and an English Doctor."
6198,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6199,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"'They have no stamina, these brats,' said the Doctor, as he left Imam"
6200,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,Din's quarters.
6201,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,
6202,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"A week later, though I would have given much to have avoided it, I"
6203,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"met on the road to the Mussulman burying-ground Imam Din, accompanied"
6204,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,"by one other friend, carrying in his arms, wrapped in a white cloth,"
6205,THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN,all that was left of little Muhammad Din.

6211,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6212,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"The evening meal was ended in Dhunni Bhagat's Chubara, and the old"
6213,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,priests were smoking or counting their beads. A little naked child
6214,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"pattered in, with its mouth wide open, a handful of marigold flowers"
6215,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"in one hand, and a lump of conserved tobacco in the other. It tried"
6216,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"to kneel and make obeisance to Gobind, but it was so fat that it fell"
6217,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"forward on its shaven head, and rolled on its side, kicking and"
6218,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"gasping, while the marigolds tumbled one way and the tobacco the"
6219,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"other. Gobind laughed, set it up again, and blessed the marigold"
6220,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,flowers as he received the tobacco.
6221,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6222,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'From my father,' said the child. 'He has the fever, and cannot come."
6223,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"Wilt thou pray for him, father?'"
6224,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6225,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Surely, littlest; but the smoke is on the ground, and the"
6226,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"night-chill is in the air, and it is not good to go abroad naked in"
6227,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,the autumn.'
6228,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6229,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'I have no clothes,' said the child, 'and all to-day I have been"
6230,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"carrying cow-dung cakes to the bazar. It was very hot, and I am very"
6231,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"tired.' It shivered a little, for the twilight was cool."
6232,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6233,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"Gobind lifted an arm under his vast tattered quilt of many colours,"
6234,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"and made an inviting little nest by his side. The child crept in, and"
6235,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,Gobind filled his brass-studded leather waterpipe with the new
6236,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,tobacco. When I came to the Chubara the shaven head with the tuft
6237,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"atop, and the beady black eyes looked out of the folds of the quilt"
6238,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"as a squirrel looks out from his nest, and Gobind was smiling while"
6239,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,the child played with his beard.
6240,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6241,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"I would have said something friendly, but remembered in time that if"
6242,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"the child fell ill afterwards I should be credited with the Evil Eye,"
6243,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"and that is a horrible possession. 'Sit thou still, Thumbling,' I"
6244,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"said, as it made to get up and run away. 'Where is thy slate, and why"
6245,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,has the teacher let such an evil character loose on the streets when
6246,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,there are no police to protect us weaklings? In which ward dost thou
6247,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,try to break thy neck with flying kites from the house-top?'
6248,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6249,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Nay, Sahib, nay,' said the child, burrowing its face into Gobind's"
6250,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"beard, and twisting uneasily. 'There was a holiday to-day among the"
6251,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"schools, and I do not always fly kites. I play ker-li-kit like the"
6252,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,rest.'
6253,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6254,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"Cricket is the national game among the school-boys of the Punjab,"
6255,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"from the naked hedge-school children, who use an old kerosine-tin for"
6256,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"wicket, to the B.A.'s of the University, who compete for the"
6257,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,Championship belt.
6258,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6259,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,'Thou play kerlikit! Thou art half the weight of the bat!' I said.
6260,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6261,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"The child nodded resolutely. 'Yea, I _do_ play. _Perlay-ball. Ow-at!"
6262,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"Ran, ran, ran!_ I know it all.'"
6263,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6264,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,'But thou must not forget with all this to pray to the Gods
6265,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"according to custom,' said Gobind, who did not altogether approve of"
6266,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,cricket and Western innovations.
6267,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6268,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'I do not forget,' said the child in a hushed voice."
6269,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6270,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Also to give reverence to thy teacher, and'--"
6271,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6272,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,Gobind's voice softened--'to abstain from pulling holy men by the
6273,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"beard, little badling. Eh, eh, eh?'"
6274,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6275,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"The child's face was altogether hidden in the great white beard, and"
6276,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,it began to whimper till Gobind soothed it as children are soothed
6277,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"all the world over, with the promise of a story."
6278,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6279,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'I did not think to frighten thee, senseless little one. Look up! Am"
6280,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"I angry? Aré, aré, aré! Shall I weep too, and of our tears make a"
6281,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"great pond and drown us both, and then thy father will never get"
6282,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"well, lacking thee to pull his beard? Peace, peace, and I will tell"
6283,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,thee of the Gods. Thou hast heard many tales?'
6284,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6285,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Very many, father.'"
6286,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6287,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Now, this is a new one, which thou hast not heard. Long and long ago"
6288,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"when the Gods walked with men, as they do to-day, but that we have"
6289,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"not faith to see, Shiv, the greatest of Gods, and Parbati his wife,"
6290,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,were walking in the garden of a temple.'
6291,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6292,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,'Which temple? That in the Nandgaon ward?' said the child.
6293,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6294,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Nay, very far away. Maybe at Trimbak or Hurdwar, whither thou must"
6295,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"make pilgrimage when thou art a man. Now, there was sitting in the"
6296,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"garden under the jujube trees, a mendicant that had worshipped Shiv"
6297,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"for forty years, and he lived on the offerings of the pious, and"
6298,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,meditated holiness night and day.'
6299,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6300,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Oh, father, was it thou?' said the child, looking up with large"
6301,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,eyes.
6302,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6303,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Nay, I have said it was long ago, and, moreover, this mendicant was"
6304,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,married.'
6305,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6306,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Did they put him on a horse with flowers on his head, and forbid him"
6307,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,to go to sleep all night long? Thus they did to me when they made my
6308,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"wedding,' said the child, who had been married a few months before."
6309,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6310,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,'And what didst thou do?' said I.
6311,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6312,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'I wept, and they called me evil names, and then I smote _her_, and"
6313,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,we wept together.'
6314,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6315,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Thus did not the mendicant,' said Gobind; 'for he was a holy man,"
6316,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,and very poor. Parbati perceived him sitting naked by the temple
6317,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"steps where all went up and down, and she said to Shiv, ""What shall"
6318,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,men think of the Gods when the Gods thus scorn the worshippers? For
6319,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"forty years yonder man has prayed to us, and yet there be only a few"
6320,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,grains of rice and some broken cowries before him after all. Men's
6321,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"hearts will be hardened by this thing."" And Shiv said, ""It shall be"
6322,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"looked to,"" and so he called to the temple, which was the temple of"
6323,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"his son, Ganesh of the elephant head, saying, ""Son, there is a"
6324,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"mendicant without who is very poor. What wilt thou do for him?"" Then"
6325,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"that great elephant-headed One awoke in the dark and answered, ""In"
6326,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"three days, if it be thy will, he shall have one lakh of rupees."""
6327,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,Then Shiv and Parbati went away.'
6328,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6329,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,'But there was a money-lender in the garden hidden among  the
6330,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,marigolds'--the child looked at the ball of crumpled blossoms in its
6331,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"hands--'ay, among the yellow marigolds, and he heard the Gods"
6332,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"talking. He was a covetous man, and of a black heart, and he desired"
6333,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,that lakh of rupees for himself. So he went to the mendicant and
6334,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"said, ""Oh brother, how much do the pious give thee daily?"" The"
6335,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"mendicant said, ""I cannot tell. Sometimes a little rice, sometimes a"
6336,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"little pulse, and a few cowries and, it has been, pickled mangoes,"
6337,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"and dried fish."""
6338,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6339,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'That is good,' said the child, smacking its lips. 'Then  said  the"
6340,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"money-lender,  ""Because  I  have  long watched thee, and learned to"
6341,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"love thee and thy patience, I will give thee now five rupees for all"
6342,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,thy earnings of the three days to come. There is only a bond to sign
6343,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"on the matter."" But the mendicant said, ""Thou art mad. In two months"
6344,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"I do not receive the worth of five rupees,"" and he told the thing to"
6345,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"his wife that evening. She, being a woman, said, ""When did"
6346,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,money-lender ever make a bad bargain? The wolf runs the corn for the
6347,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,sake of the fat deer. Our fate is in the hands of the Gods. Pledge it
6348,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"not even for three days."""
6349,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6350,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'So the mendicant returned to the money-lender, and would not sell."
6351,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,Then that wicked man sat all day before him offering more and more
6352,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"for those, three days' earnings. First, ten, fifty, and a hundred"
6353,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"rupees; and then, for he did not know when the Gods would pour down"
6354,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"their gifts, rupees by the thousand, till he had offered half a lakh"
6355,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"of rupees. Upon this sum the mendicant's wife shifted her counsel,"
6356,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"and the mendicant signed the bond, and the money was paid in silver;"
6357,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,great white bullocks bringing it by the cartload. But saving only all
6358,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"that money, the mendicant received nothing from the Gods at all, and"
6359,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,the heart of the money-lender was uneasy on account of expectation.
6360,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,Therefore at noon of the third day the money-lender went into the
6361,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"temple to spy upon the councils of the Gods, and to learn in what"
6362,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"manner that gift might arrive. Even as he was making his prayers,"
6363,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"a crack between the stones of the floor gaped, and, closing, caught"
6364,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,him by the heel. Then he heard the Gods walking in the temple in the
6365,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"darkness of the columns, and Shiv called to his son Ganesh, saying"
6366,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"""Son, what hast thou done in regard to the lakh of rupees for the"
6367,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"mendicant?"" And Ganesh woke, for the moneylender heard the dry rustle"
6368,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"of his trunk uncoiling, and he answered, ""Father, one-half of the"
6369,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"money has been paid, and the debtor for the other half I hold here"
6370,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"fast by the heel.""'"
6371,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6372,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,The child bubbled with laughter. 'And the moneylender paid the
6373,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,mendicant?' it said.
6374,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6375,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Surely, for he whom the Gods hold by the heel must pay to the"
6376,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"uttermost. The money was paid at evening, all silver, in great carts,"
6377,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,and thus Ganesh did his work.'
6378,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6379,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,'Nathu! Oh^e Nathu!'
6380,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6381,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,A woman was calling in the dusk by the door of the courtyard.
6382,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6383,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"The child began to wriggle. 'That is my mother,' it said."
6384,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6385,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"'Go then, littlest,' answered Gobind; 'but stay a moment.'"
6386,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,
6387,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"He ripped a generous yard from his patchwork-quilt, put it over the"
6388,THE FINANCES OF THE GODS,"child's shoulders, and the child ran away."

6393,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER
6394,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6395,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Once upon a time there was a coffee-planter in India who wished to
6396,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,clear some forest land for coffee-planting. When he had cut down all
6397,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the trees and burned the under-wood the stumps still remained.
6398,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Dynamite is expensive and slow-fire slow. The happy medium for
6399,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"stump-clearing is the lord of all beasts, who is the elephant. He"
6400,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"will either push the stump out of the ground with his tusks, if he"
6401,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"has any, or drag it out with ropes. The planter, therefore, hired"
6402,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"elephants by ones and twos and threes, and fell to work. The very"
6403,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,best of all the elephants belonged to the very worst of all the
6404,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,drivers or mahouts; and the  superior beast's name was Moti Guj. He
6405,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"was the absolute property of his mahout, which would never have been"
6406,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"the case under native rule, for Moti Guj was a creature to be"
6407,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"desired by kings; and his name, being translated, meant the Pearl"
6408,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Elephant. Because the British Government was in the land, Deesa,"
6409,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"the mahout, enjoyed his property undisturbed. He was dissipated. When"
6410,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"he had made much money through the strength of his elephant, he would"
6411,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,get extremely drunk and give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg over
6412,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the tender nails of the forefeet. Moti Guj never trampled the life
6413,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"out of Deesa on these occasions, for he knew that after the beating"
6414,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"was over Deesa would embrace his trunk, and weep and call him his"
6415,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"love and his life and the liver of his soul, and give him some"
6416,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"liquor. Moti Guj was very fond of liquor--arrack for choice, though"
6417,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,he would drink palm-tree toddy if nothing better offered. Then Deesa
6418,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"would go to sleep between Moti Guj's forefeet, and as Deesa generally"
6419,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"chose the middle of the public road, and as Moti Guj mounted guard"
6420,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"over him and would not permit horse, foot, or cart to pass by,"
6421,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,traffic was congested till Deesa saw fit to wake up.
6422,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6423,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter's clearing; the
6424,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,wages were too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti Guj's neck and gave
6425,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"him orders, while Moti Guj rooted up the stumps--for he owned a"
6426,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,magnificent pair of tusks; or pulled at the end of a rope--for he had
6427,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"a magnificent pair of shoulders, while Deesa kicked him behind the"
6428,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,ears and said he was the king of elephants. At evening time Moti Guj
6429,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,would wash down his three hundred pounds' weight of green food with a
6430,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"quart of arrack, and Deesa would take a share and sing songs between"
6431,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj's legs till it was time to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led
6432,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj down to the river, and Moti Guj lay on his side luxuriously"
6433,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"in the shallows, while Deesa went over him with a coir-swab and a"
6434,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,brick. Moti Guj never mistook the pounding blow of the latter for the
6435,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,smack of the former that warned him to get up and turn over on the
6436,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"other side. Then Deesa would look at his feet, and examine his eyes,"
6437,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of sores or
6438,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"budding ophthalmia. After  inspection, the two would 'come up with a"
6439,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"song from the sea,' Moti Guj all black and shining, waving a torn"
6440,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"tree branch twelve feet long in his trunk, and Deesa knotting up his"
6441,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,own long wet hair.
6442,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6443,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"It was a peaceful, well-paid life till Deesa felt the return of the"
6444,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,desire to drink deep. He wished for an orgie. The little draughts
6445,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,that led nowhere were taking the manhood out of him.
6446,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6447,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"He went to the planter, and 'My mother's dead,' said he, weeping."
6448,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6449,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,'She died on the last plantation two months ago; and she died once
6450,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"before that when you were working for me last year,' said the"
6451,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"planter, who knew something of the ways of nativedom."
6452,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6453,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Then it's my aunt, and she was just the same as a mother to me,'"
6454,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"said Deesa, weeping more than ever. 'She has left eighteen small"
6455,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"children entirely without bread, and it is I who must fill their"
6456,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"little stomachs,' said Deesa, beating his head on the floor."
6457,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6458,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Who brought you the news?' said the planter. 'The post,' said"
6459,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Deesa.
6460,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6461,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,'There hasn't been a post here for the past week. Get back to your
6462,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,lines!'
6463,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6464,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'A devastating sickness has fallen on my village, and all my wives"
6465,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"are dying,' yelled Deesa, really in tears this time. 'Call Chihun,"
6466,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"who comes from Deesa's village,' said the planter. 'Chihun, has this"
6467,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,man a wife?'
6468,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6469,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,'He!' said Chihun. 'No. Not a woman of our village would look at him.
6470,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,They'd sooner marry the elephant.' Chihun snorted. Deesa wept and
6471,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,bellowed.
6472,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6473,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'You will get into a difficulty in a minute,' said the planter. 'Go"
6474,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,back to your work!'
6475,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6476,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Now I will speak Heaven's truth,' gulped Deesa, with an inspiration."
6477,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,'I haven't been drunk for two months. I desire to depart in order to
6478,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,get properly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly
6479,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,plantation. Thus I shall cause no trouble.'
6480,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6481,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"A flickering smile crossed the planter's face. 'Deesa,' said he,"
6482,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'you've spoken the truth, and I'd give you leave on the spot if"
6483,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,anything could be done with Moti Guj while you're away. You know that
6484,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,he will only obey your orders.'
6485,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6486,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,'May the Light of the Heavens live forty thousand years. I shall be
6487,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"absent but ten little days. After that, upon my faith and honour and"
6488,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"soul, I return. As to the inconsiderable interval, have I the"
6489,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,gracious permission of the Heaven-born to call up Moti Guj?'
6490,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6491,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Permission was granted, and, in answer to Deesa's shrill yell, the"
6492,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,lordly tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had
6493,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,been squirting dust over himself till his master should return.
6494,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6495,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Light of my heart, Protector of the Drunken, Mountain of Might, give"
6496,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"ear,' said Deesa, standing in front of him."
6497,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6498,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj gave ear, and saluted with his trunk, 'I am going away,'"
6499,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,said Deesa.
6500,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6501,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj's eyes twinkled. He liked jaunts as well as his master. One
6502,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,could snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then.
6503,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6504,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'But you, you fubsy old pig, must stay behind and work.'"
6505,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6506,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,The twinkle died out as Moti Guj tried to look delighted. He hated
6507,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,stump-hauling on the plantation. It hurt his teeth.
6508,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6509,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'I shall be gone for ten days, oh Delectable One. Hold up your near"
6510,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"forefoot and I'll impress the fact upon it, warty toad of a dried"
6511,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,mud-puddle.' Deesa took a tent-peg and banged Moti Guj ten times on
6512,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the nails. Moti Guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot.
6513,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6514,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Ten days,' said Deesa, 'you must work and haul and root trees as"
6515,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Chihun here shall order you. Take up Chihun and set him on your
6516,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"neck!' Moti Guj curled the tip of his trunk, Chihun put his foot"
6517,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,there and was swung on to the neck. Deesa handed Chihun the heavy
6518,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"_ankus_, the iron elephant-goad."
6519,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6520,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Chihun thumped Moti Guj's bald head as a paviour thumps a kerbstone.
6521,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6522,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj trumpeted.
6523,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6524,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Be still, hog of the backwoods. Chihun's your mahout for ten days."
6525,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"And now bid me good-bye, beast after mine own heart. Oh, my lord, my"
6526,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"king! Jewel of all created elephants, lily of the herd, preserve your"
6527,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,honoured health; be virtuous. Adieu!'
6528,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6529,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa and swung him into the air
6530,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,twice. That was his way of bidding the man good-bye.
6531,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6532,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'He'll work now,' said Deesa to the planter. 'Have I leave to go?'"
6533,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6534,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"The planter nodded, and Deesa dived into the woods. Moti Guj went"
6535,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,back to haul stumps.
6536,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6537,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Chihun was very kind to him, but he felt unhappy and forlorn"
6538,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"notwithstanding. Chihun gave him balls of spices, and tickled him"
6539,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"under the chin, and Chihun's little baby cooed to him after work was"
6540,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"over, and Chihun's wife called him a darling; but Moti Guj was a"
6541,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"bachelor by instinct, as Deesa was. He did not understand the"
6542,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,domestic emotions. He wanted the light of his universe back
6543,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"again--the drink and the drunken slumber, the savage beatings and the"
6544,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,savage caresses.
6545,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6546,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"None the less he worked well, and the planter wondered. Deesa had"
6547,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,vagabonded along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his
6548,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"own caste and, drinking, dancing, and tippling, had drifted past all"
6549,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,knowledge of the lapse of time.
6550,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6551,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"The morning of the eleventh day dawned, and there returned no Deesa."
6552,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint. He swung
6553,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"clear, looked round, shrugged his shoulders, and began to walk away,"
6554,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,as one having business elsewhere.
6555,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6556,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Hi! ho! Come back you,' shouted Chihun. 'Come back, and put me on"
6557,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"your neck, Misborn Mountain. Return, Splendour of the Hillsides."
6558,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Adornment of all India, heave to, or I'll bang every toe off your fat"
6559,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,forefoot!'
6560,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6561,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj gurgled gently, but did not obey. Chihun ran after him with"
6562,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"a rope and caught him up. Moti Guj put his ears forward, and Chihun"
6563,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"knew what that meant, though he tried to carry it off with high"
6564,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,words.
6565,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6566,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'None of your nonsense with me,' said he. 'To your pickets,"
6567,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Devil-son.'
6568,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6569,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Hrrump!' said Moti Guj, and that was all--that and the forebent"
6570,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,ears.
6571,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6572,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj put his hands in his pockets, chewed a branch for a"
6573,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"toothpick, and strolled about the clearing, making jest of the other"
6574,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"elephants, who had just set to work."
6575,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6576,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter, who came out"
6577,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,with a dog-whip and cracked it furiously. Moti Guj paid the white man
6578,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the
6579,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,clearing and 'Hrrumphing' him into the verandah. Then he stood
6580,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"outside the house chuckling to himself, and shaking all over with the"
6581,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"fun of it, as an elephant will."
6582,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6583,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'We'll thrash him,' said the planter. 'He shall have the finest"
6584,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,thrashing that ever elephant received. Give Kala Nag and Nazim twelve
6585,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"foot of chain apiece, and tell them to lay on twenty blows.'"
6586,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6587,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Kala Nag--which means Black Snake--and Nazim were two of the biggest
6588,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"elephants in the lines, and one of their duties was to administer the"
6589,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"graver punishments, since no man can beat an elephant properly."
6590,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6591,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,They took the whipping-chains and rattled them in their trunks as
6592,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"they sidled up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle him between them. Moti"
6593,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Guj had never, in all his life of thirty-nine years, been whipped,"
6594,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"and he did not intend to open new experiences. So he waited, weaving"
6595,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"his head from right to left, and measuring the precise spot in Kala"
6596,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Nag's fat side where a blunt tusk would sink deepest. Kala Nag had no
6597,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,tusks; the chain was his badge of authority; but he judged it good to
6598,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"swing wide of Moti Guj at the last minute, and seem to appear as if"
6599,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,he had brought out the chain for amusement. Nazim turned round and
6600,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"went home early. He did not feel fighting-fit that morning, and so"
6601,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj was left standing alone with his ears cocked.
6602,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6603,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"That decided the planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj rolled back"
6604,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"to his inspection of the clearing. An elephant who will not work, and"
6605,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"is not tied up, is not quite so manageable as an eighty-one ton gun"
6606,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,loose in a heavy sea-way. He slapped old friends on the back and
6607,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,asked them if the stumps were coming away easily; he talked nonsense
6608,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,concerning labour and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long
6609,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'nooning'; and wandering to and fro, thoroughly demoralised the"
6610,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"garden until sundown, when he returned to his pickets for food."
6611,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6612,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'If you won't work you shan't eat,' said Chihun angrily. 'You're a"
6613,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"wild elephant, and no educated animal at all. Go back to your"
6614,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,jungle.'
6615,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6616,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Chihun's little brown baby, rolling on the floor of the hut,"
6617,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,stretched its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway. Moti Guj
6618,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to Chihun. He swung
6619,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"out his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end, and the brown baby"
6620,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,threw itself shouting upon it. Moti Guj made fast and pulled up till
6621,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the brown baby was crowing in the air twelve feet above his father's
6622,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,head.
6623,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6624,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Great Chief!' said Chihun. 'Flour cakes of the best, twelve in"
6625,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"number, two feet across, and soaked in rum shall be yours on the"
6626,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"instant, and two hundred pounds' weight of fresh-cut young"
6627,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,sugar-cane therewith. Deign only to put down safely that
6628,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,insignificant brat who is my heart and my life to me.'
6629,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6630,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"Moti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet,"
6631,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"that could have knocked into toothpicks all Chihun's hut, and waited"
6632,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"for his food. He ate it, and the brown baby crawled away. Moti Guj"
6633,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"dozed, and thought of Deesa. One of many mysteries connected with the"
6634,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,elephant is that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else
6635,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,that lives. Four or five hours in the night suffice--two just before
6636,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"midnight, lying down on one side; two just after one o'clock, lying"
6637,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,down on the other. The rest of the silent hours are filled with
6638,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,eating and fidgeting and long grumbling soliloquies.
6639,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6640,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for a"
6641,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,thought had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in
6642,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,the dark forest with none to look after him. So all that night he
6643,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"chased through the undergrowth, blowing and trumpeting and shaking"
6644,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,his ears. He went down to the river and blared across the shallows
6645,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"where Deesa used to wash him, but there was no answer. He could not"
6646,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"find Deesa, but he disturbed all the elephants in the lines, and"
6647,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,nearly frightened to death some gipsies in the woods.
6648,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6649,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very drunk
6650,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"indeed, and he expected to fall into trouble for outstaying his"
6651,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,leave. He drew a long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the
6652,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,plantation were still uninjured; for he knew something of Moti Guj's
6653,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,temper; and reported himself with many lies and salaams. Moti Guj had
6654,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,gone to his pickets for breakfast. His night exercise had made him
6655,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,hungry.
6656,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6657,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Call up your beast,' said the planter, and Deesa shouted in the"
6658,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"mysterious elephant-language, that some mahouts believe came from"
6659,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"China at the birth of the world, when elephants and not men were"
6660,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,masters. Moti Guj heard and came. Elephants do not gallop. They move
6661,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,from spots at varying rates of speed. If an elephant wished to catch
6662,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"an express train he could not gallop, but he could catch the train."
6663,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Thus Moti Guj was at the planter's door almost before Chihun noticed
6664,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,that he had left his pickets. He fell into Deesa's arms trumpeting
6665,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"with joy, and the man and beast wept and slobbered over each other,"
6666,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,and handled each other from head to heel to see that no harm had
6667,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,befallen.
6668,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6669,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,"'Now we will get to work,' said Deesa. 'Lift me up, my son and my"
6670,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,joy.'
6671,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6672,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,Moti Guj swung him up and the two went to the coffee-clearing to look
6673,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,for irksome stumps.
6674,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,
6675,MOTI GUJ--MUTINEER,The planter was too astonished to be very angry.

6905,MUNICIPAL.,
6906,MUNICIPAL.,"It was an August evening and, in snowy garments clad,"
6907,MUNICIPAL.,I paid a round of visits in the lines of Hezabad;
6908,MUNICIPAL.,"When, presently, my Waler saw, and did not like at all,"
6909,MUNICIPAL.,A Commissariat elephant careering down the Mall.
6910,MUNICIPAL.,
6911,MUNICIPAL.,"I couldn't see the driver, and across my mind it rushed"

6913,MUNICIPAL.,"I didn't care to meet him, and I couldn't well get down,"
6914,MUNICIPAL.,"So I let the Waler have it, and we headed for the town."
6915,MUNICIPAL.,
6916,MUNICIPAL.,"The buggy was a new one and, praise Dykes, it stood the strain,"
6917,MUNICIPAL.,Till the Waler jumped a bullock just above the City Drain;
6918,MUNICIPAL.,"And the next that I remember was a hurricane of squeals,"
6919,MUNICIPAL.,And the creature making toothpicks of my five-foot patent wheels.
6920,MUNICIPAL.,
6921,MUNICIPAL.,"He seemed to want the owner, so I fled, distraught with fear,"
6922,MUNICIPAL.,To the Main Drain sewage outfall while he snorted in my ear--
6923,MUNICIPAL.,"Reached the four-foot drain-head safely and, in darkness and despair,"
6924,MUNICIPAL.,"Felt the brute's proboscis fingering my terror-stiffened hair,"
6925,MUNICIPAL.,
6926,MUNICIPAL.,Heard it trumpet on my shoulder--tried to crawl a little higher--
6927,MUNICIPAL.,"Found the Main Drain sewage-outfall blocked some eight feet up,"
6928,MUNICIPAL.,with mire;
6929,MUNICIPAL.,"And, for twenty reeking minutes, Sir, my very marrow froze,"
6930,MUNICIPAL.,While the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes!
6931,MUNICIPAL.,
6932,MUNICIPAL.,"It missed me by a fraction, but my hair was turning grey"
6933,MUNICIPAL.,Before they called the drivers up arid dragged the brute away.
6934,MUNICIPAL.,"Then I sought the City Elders, and my words were very plain."
6935,MUNICIPAL.,They flushed that four-foot drain-head and--it never choked again.
6936,MUNICIPAL.,
6937,MUNICIPAL.,"You may hold with surface-drainage, and the sun-for-garbage cure,"
6938,MUNICIPAL.,Till you've been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer.
6939,MUNICIPAL.,_I_ believe in well-flushed culverts ... This is why the
