2077,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2078,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2079,THE WELL-BELOVED,I wayed by star and planet shine
2080,THE WELL-BELOVED,Towards the dear one’s home
2081,THE WELL-BELOVED,"At Kingsbere, there to make her mine"
2082,THE WELL-BELOVED,When the next sun upclomb.
2083,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2084,THE WELL-BELOVED,I edged the ancient hill and wood
2085,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Beside the Ikling Way,"
2086,THE WELL-BELOVED,Nigh where the Pagan temple stood
2087,THE WELL-BELOVED,In the world’s earlier day.
2088,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2089,THE WELL-BELOVED,And as I quick and quicker walked
2090,THE WELL-BELOVED,"On gravel and on green,"
2091,THE WELL-BELOVED,"I sang to sky, and tree, or talked"
2092,THE WELL-BELOVED,Of her I called my queen.
2093,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2094,THE WELL-BELOVED,"—“O faultless is her dainty form,"
2095,THE WELL-BELOVED,And luminous her mind;
2096,THE WELL-BELOVED,She is the God-created norm
2097,THE WELL-BELOVED,Of perfect womankind!”
2098,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2099,THE WELL-BELOVED,A shape whereon one star-blink gleamed
2100,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Glode softly by my side,"
2101,THE WELL-BELOVED,A woman’s; and her motion seemed
2102,THE WELL-BELOVED,The motion of my bride.
2103,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2104,THE WELL-BELOVED,And yet methought she’d drawn erstwhile
2105,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Adown the ancient leaze,"
2106,THE WELL-BELOVED,Where once were pile and peristyle
2107,THE WELL-BELOVED,For men’s idolatries.
2108,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2109,THE WELL-BELOVED,"—“O maiden lithe and lone, what may"
2110,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Thy name and lineage be,"
2111,THE WELL-BELOVED,Who so resemblest by this ray
2112,THE WELL-BELOVED,My darling?—Art thou she?”
2113,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2114,THE WELL-BELOVED,The Shape: “Thy bride remains within
2115,THE WELL-BELOVED,Her father’s grange and grove.”
2116,THE WELL-BELOVED,"—“Thou speakest rightly,” I broke in,"
2117,THE WELL-BELOVED,“Thou art not she I love.”
2118,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2119,THE WELL-BELOVED,—“Nay: though thy bride remains inside
2120,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Her father’s walls,” said she,"
2121,THE WELL-BELOVED,"“The one most dear is with thee here,"
2122,THE WELL-BELOVED,For thou dost love but me.”
2123,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2124,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Then I: “But she, my only choice,"
2125,THE WELL-BELOVED,Is now at Kingsbere Grove?”
2126,THE WELL-BELOVED,Again her soft mysterious voice:
2127,THE WELL-BELOVED,“I am thy only Love.”
2128,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2129,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Thus still she vouched, and still I said,"
2130,THE WELL-BELOVED,"“O sprite, that cannot be!” . . ."
2131,THE WELL-BELOVED,"It was as if my bosom bled,"
2132,THE WELL-BELOVED,So much she troubled me.
2133,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2134,THE WELL-BELOVED,The sprite resumed: “Thou hast transferred
2135,THE WELL-BELOVED,To her dull form awhile
2136,THE WELL-BELOVED,"My beauty, fame, and deed, and word,"
2137,THE WELL-BELOVED,My gestures and my smile.
2138,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2139,THE WELL-BELOVED,"“O fatuous man, this truth infer,"
2140,THE WELL-BELOVED,Brides are not what they seem;
2141,THE WELL-BELOVED,Thou lovest what thou dreamest her;
2142,THE WELL-BELOVED,I am thy very dream!”
2143,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2144,THE WELL-BELOVED,"—“O then,” I answered miserably,"
2145,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Speaking as scarce I knew,"
2146,THE WELL-BELOVED,"“My loved one, I must wed with thee"
2147,THE WELL-BELOVED,If what thou say’st be true!”
2148,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2149,THE WELL-BELOVED,"She, proudly, thinning in the gloom:"
2150,THE WELL-BELOVED,"“Though, since troth-plight began,"
2151,THE WELL-BELOVED,"I’ve ever stood as bride to groom,"
2152,THE WELL-BELOVED,I wed no mortal man!”
2153,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2154,THE WELL-BELOVED,Thereat she vanished by the Cross
2155,THE WELL-BELOVED,"That, entering Kingsbere town,"
2156,THE WELL-BELOVED,"The two long lanes form, near the fosse"
2157,THE WELL-BELOVED,Below the faneless Down.
2158,THE WELL-BELOVED,
2159,THE WELL-BELOVED,"—When I arrived and met my bride,"
2160,THE WELL-BELOVED,"Her look was pinched and thin,"
2161,THE WELL-BELOVED,"As if her soul had shrunk and died,"
2162,THE WELL-BELOVED,And left a waste within.

2425,THE WIDOW,"Towards her door I went,"

2427,THE WIDOW,Reflected our intent.
2428,THE WIDOW,
2429,THE WIDOW,The creeper on the gable nigh
2430,THE WIDOW,Was fired to more than red
2431,THE WIDOW,And when I came to halt thereby
2432,THE WIDOW,“Bright as my joy!” I said.
2433,THE WIDOW,
2434,THE WIDOW,Of late days it had been her aim
2435,THE WIDOW,To meet me in the hall;
2436,THE WIDOW,Now at my footsteps no one came;
2437,THE WIDOW,And no one to my call.
2438,THE WIDOW,
2439,THE WIDOW,Again I knocked; and tardily
2440,THE WIDOW,"An inner step was heard,"
2441,THE WIDOW,And I was shown her presence then
2442,THE WIDOW,With scarce an answering word.
2443,THE WIDOW,
2444,THE WIDOW,"She met me, and but barely took"
2445,THE WIDOW,My proffered warm embrace;
2446,THE WIDOW,"Preoccupation weighed her look,"
2447,THE WIDOW,And hardened her sweet face.
2448,THE WIDOW,
2449,THE WIDOW,“To-morrow—could you—would you call?
2450,THE WIDOW,Make brief your present stay?
2451,THE WIDOW,"My child is ill—my one, my all!—"
2452,THE WIDOW,And can’t be left to-day.”
2453,THE WIDOW,
2454,THE WIDOW,"And then she turns, and gives commands"
2455,THE WIDOW,"As I were out of sound,"
2456,THE WIDOW,Or were no more to her and hers
2457,THE WIDOW,Than any neighbour round . . .
2458,THE WIDOW,
2459,THE WIDOW,—As maid I wooed her; but one came
2460,THE WIDOW,"And coaxed her heart away,"
2461,THE WIDOW,And when in time he wedded her
2462,THE WIDOW,I deemed her gone for aye.
2463,THE WIDOW,
2464,THE WIDOW,"He won, I lost her; and my loss"
2465,THE WIDOW,I bore I know not how;
2466,THE WIDOW,But I do think I suffered then
2467,THE WIDOW,Less wretchedness than now.
2468,THE WIDOW,
2469,THE WIDOW,"For Time, in taking him, had oped"
2470,THE WIDOW,An unexpected door
2471,THE WIDOW,"Of bliss for me, which grew to seem"
2472,THE WIDOW,Far surer than before . . .
2473,THE WIDOW,
2474,THE WIDOW,"Her word is steadfast, and I know"
2475,THE WIDOW,That plighted firm are we:

2477,THE WIDOW,She smiled as maid on me!

3809,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},In the field that was Cernel choir).
3810,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3811,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},One night in his cell at the foot of yon dell
3812,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},The priest heard a frequent cry:
3813,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"“Go, father, in haste to the cot on the waste,"
3814,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And shrive a man waiting to die.”
3815,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3816,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Said the priest in a shout to the caller without,"
3817,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"“The night howls, the tree-trunks bow;"
3818,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"One may barely by day track so rugged a way,"
3819,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And can I then do so now?”
3820,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3821,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"No further word from the dark was heard,"
3822,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And the priest moved never a limb;
3823,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And he slept and dreamed; till a Visage seemed
3824,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},To frown from Heaven at him.
3825,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3826,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"In a sweat he arose; and the storm shrieked shrill,"
3827,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And smote as in savage joy;
3828,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"While High-Stoy trees twanged to Bubb-Down Hill,"
3829,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And Bubb-Down to High-Stoy.
3830,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3831,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"There seemed not a holy thing in hail,"
3832,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Nor shape of light or love,"
3833,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},From the Abbey north of Blackmore Vale

3836,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Yet he plodded thence through the dark immense,"
3837,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And with many a stumbling stride
3838,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Through copse and briar climbed nigh and nigher
3839,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},To the cot and the sick man’s side.
3840,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3841,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},When he would have unslung the Vessels uphung
3842,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"To his arm in the steep ascent,"
3843,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},He made loud moan: the Pyx was gone
3844,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Of the Blessed Sacrament.
3845,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3846,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Then in dolorous dread he beat his head:
3847,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},“No earthly prize or pelf
3848,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Is the thing I’ve lost in tempest tossed,"
3849,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},But the Body of Christ Himself!”
3850,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3851,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"He thought of the Visage his dream revealed,"
3852,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"And turned towards whence he came,"
3853,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Hands groping the ground along foot-track and field,"
3854,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And head in a heat of shame.
3855,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3856,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Till here on the hill, betwixt vill and vill,"
3857,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},He noted a clear straight ray
3858,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Stretching down from the sky to a spot hard by,"
3859,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Which shone with the light of day.
3860,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3861,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And gathered around the illumined ground
3862,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Were common beasts and rare,"
3863,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"All kneeling at gaze, and in pause profound"
3864,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Attent on an object there.
3865,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3866,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"’Twas the Pyx, unharmed ’mid the circling rows"
3867,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Of Blackmore’s hairy throng,"
3868,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Whereof were oxen, sheep, and does,"
3869,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And hares from the brakes among;
3870,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3871,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"And badgers grey, and conies keen,"
3872,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"And squirrels of the tree,"
3873,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And many a member seldom seen
3874,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Of Nature’s family.

3877,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"Through coppice, clump, and dell,"
3878,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Within that holy circle slept
3879,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Calm as in hermit’s cell.
3880,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3881,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Then the priest bent likewise to the sod
3882,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"And thanked the Lord of Love,"
3883,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"And Blessed Mary, Mother of God,"
3884,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},And all the saints above.
3885,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3886,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"And turning straight with his priceless freight,"
3887,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"He reached the dying one,"
3888,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Whose passing sprite had been stayed for the rite
3889,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},Without which bliss hath none.
3890,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},
3891,A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND {457},"And when by grace the priest won place,"
