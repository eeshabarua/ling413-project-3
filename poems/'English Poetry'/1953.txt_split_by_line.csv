52,JANUARY.,JANUARY.
53,JANUARY.,
54,JANUARY.,1.
55,JANUARY.,
56,JANUARY.,"LORD, what I once had done with youthful might,"
57,JANUARY.,"Had I been from the first true to the truth,"
58,JANUARY.,"Grant me, now old, to do--with better sight,"
59,JANUARY.,"And humbler heart, if not the brain of youth;"
60,JANUARY.,"So wilt thou, in thy gentleness and ruth,"
61,JANUARY.,"Lead back thy old soul, by the path of pain,"
62,JANUARY.,Round to his best--young eyes and heart and brain.
63,JANUARY.,
64,JANUARY.,2.
65,JANUARY.,
66,JANUARY.,"A dim aurora rises in my east,"
67,JANUARY.,"Beyond the line of jagged questions hoar,"
68,JANUARY.,As if the head of our intombed High Priest
69,JANUARY.,Began to glow behind the unopened door:
70,JANUARY.,Sure the gold wings will soon rise from the gray!--
71,JANUARY.,"They rise not. Up I rise, press on the more,"
72,JANUARY.,To meet the slow coming of the Master's day.
73,JANUARY.,
74,JANUARY.,3.
75,JANUARY.,
76,JANUARY.,"Sometimes I wake, and, lo! I have forgot,"
77,JANUARY.,And drifted out upon an ebbing sea!
78,JANUARY.,"My soul that was at rest now resteth not,"
79,JANUARY.,For I am with myself and not with thee;
80,JANUARY.,"Truth seems a blind moon in a glaring morn,"
81,JANUARY.,Where nothing is but sick-heart vanity:
82,JANUARY.,"Oh, thou who knowest! save thy child forlorn."
83,JANUARY.,
84,JANUARY.,4.
85,JANUARY.,
86,JANUARY.,"Death, like high faith, levelling, lifteth all."
87,JANUARY.,"When I awake, my daughter and my son,"
88,JANUARY.,"Grown sister and brother, in my arms shall fall,"
89,JANUARY.,Tenfold my girl and boy. Sure every one
90,JANUARY.,Of all the brood to the old wings will run.
91,JANUARY.,Whole-hearted is my worship of the man
92,JANUARY.,From whom my earthly history began.
93,JANUARY.,
94,JANUARY.,5.
95,JANUARY.,
96,JANUARY.,Thy fishes breathe but where thy waters roll;
97,JANUARY.,Thy birds fly but within thy airy sea;
98,JANUARY.,My soul breathes only in thy infinite soul;
99,JANUARY.,"I breathe, I think, I love, I live but thee."
100,JANUARY.,"Oh breathe, oh think,--O Love, live into me;"
101,JANUARY.,"Unworthy is my life till all divine,"
102,JANUARY.,Till thou see in me only what is thine.
103,JANUARY.,
104,JANUARY.,6.
105,JANUARY.,
106,JANUARY.,"Then shall I breathe in sweetest sharing, then"
107,JANUARY.,Think in harmonious consort with my kin;
108,JANUARY.,"Then shall I love well all my father's men,"
109,JANUARY.,Feel one with theirs the life my heart within.
110,JANUARY.,Oh brothers! sisters holy! hearts divine!
111,JANUARY.,"Then I shall be all yours, and nothing mine--"
112,JANUARY.,To every human heart a mother-twin.
113,JANUARY.,
114,JANUARY.,7.
115,JANUARY.,
116,JANUARY.,"I see a child before an empty house,"
117,JANUARY.,Knocking and knocking at the closed door;
118,JANUARY.,"He wakes dull echoes--but nor man nor mouse,"
119,JANUARY.,If he stood knocking there for evermore.--
120,JANUARY.,"A mother angel, see! folding each wing,"
121,JANUARY.,"Soft-walking, crosses straight the empty floor,"
122,JANUARY.,And opens to the obstinate praying thing.
123,JANUARY.,
124,JANUARY.,8.
125,JANUARY.,
126,JANUARY.,"Were there but some deep, holy spell, whereby"
127,JANUARY.,Always I should remember thee--some mode
128,JANUARY.,Of feeling the pure heat-throb momently
129,JANUARY.,Of the spirit-fire still uttering this I!--
130,JANUARY.,"Lord, see thou to it, take thou remembrance' load:"
131,JANUARY.,Only when I bethink me can I cry;
132,JANUARY.,"Remember thou, and prick me with love's goad."
133,JANUARY.,
134,JANUARY.,9.
135,JANUARY.,
136,JANUARY.,"If to myself--""God sometimes interferes""--"
137,JANUARY.,"I said, my faith at once would be struck blind."
138,JANUARY.,"I see him all in all, the lifing mind,"
139,JANUARY.,Or nowhere in the vacant miles and years.
140,JANUARY.,"A love he is that watches and that hears,"
141,JANUARY.,"Or but a mist fumed up from minds of men,"
142,JANUARY.,Whose fear and hope reach out beyond their ken.
143,JANUARY.,
144,JANUARY.,10.
145,JANUARY.,
146,JANUARY.,"When I no more can stir my soul to move,"
147,JANUARY.,And life is but the ashes of a fire;
148,JANUARY.,When I can but remember that my heart
149,JANUARY.,"Once used to live and love, long and aspire,--"
150,JANUARY.,"Oh, be thou then the first, the one thou art;"
151,JANUARY.,"Be thou the calling, before all answering love,"
152,JANUARY.,"And in me wake hope, fear, boundless desire."
153,JANUARY.,
154,JANUARY.,11.
155,JANUARY.,
156,JANUARY.,"I thought that I had lost thee; but, behold!"
157,JANUARY.,"Thou comest to me from the horizon low,"
158,JANUARY.,Across the fields outspread of green and gold--
159,JANUARY.,Fair carpet for thy feet to come and go.
160,JANUARY.,"Whence I know not, or how to me thou art come!--"
161,JANUARY.,"Not less my spirit with calm bliss doth glow,"
162,JANUARY.,"Meeting thee only thus, in nature vague and dumb."
163,JANUARY.,
164,JANUARY.,12.
165,JANUARY.,
166,JANUARY.,"Doubt swells and surges, with swelling doubt behind!"
167,JANUARY.,"My soul in storm is but a tattered sail,"
168,JANUARY.,Streaming its ribbons on the torrent gale;
169,JANUARY.,"In calm, 'tis but a limp and flapping thing:"
170,JANUARY.,"Oh! swell it with thy breath; make it a wing,--"
171,JANUARY.,"To sweep through thee the ocean, with thee the wind"
172,JANUARY.,Nor rest until in thee its haven it shall find.
173,JANUARY.,
174,JANUARY.,13.
175,JANUARY.,
176,JANUARY.,The idle flapping of the sail is doubt;
177,JANUARY.,Faith swells it full to breast the breasting seas.
178,JANUARY.,"Bold, conscience, fast, and rule the ruling helm;"
179,JANUARY.,"Hell's freezing north no tempest can send out,"
180,JANUARY.,But it shall toss thee homeward to thy leas;
181,JANUARY.,Boisterous wave-crest never shall o'erwhelm
182,JANUARY.,Thy sea-float bark as safe as field-borne rooted elm.
183,JANUARY.,
184,JANUARY.,14.
185,JANUARY.,
186,JANUARY.,"Sometimes, hard-trying, it seems I cannot pray--"
187,JANUARY.,"For doubt, and pain, and anger, and all strife."
188,JANUARY.,Yet some poor half-fledged prayer-bird from the nest
189,JANUARY.,"May fall, flit, fly, perch--crouch in the bowery breast"
190,JANUARY.,"Of the large, nation-healing tree of life;--"
191,JANUARY.,"Moveless there sit through all the burning day,"
192,JANUARY.,And on my heart at night a fresh leaf cooling lay.
193,JANUARY.,
194,JANUARY.,15.
195,JANUARY.,
196,JANUARY.,"My harvest withers. Health, my means to live--"
197,JANUARY.,All things seem rushing straight into the dark.
198,JANUARY.,But the dark still is God. I would not give
199,JANUARY.,The smallest silver-piece to turn the rush
200,JANUARY.,Backward or sideways. Am I not a spark
201,JANUARY.,Of him who is the light?--Fair hope doth flush
202,JANUARY.,"My east.--Divine success--Oh, hush and hark!"
203,JANUARY.,
204,JANUARY.,16.
205,JANUARY.,
206,JANUARY.,Thy will be done. I yield up everything.
207,JANUARY.,"""The life is more than meat""--then more than health;"
208,JANUARY.,"""The body more than raiment""--then than wealth;"
209,JANUARY.,"The hairs I made not, thou art numbering."
210,JANUARY.,"Thou art my life--I the brook, thou the spring."
211,JANUARY.,"Because thine eyes are open, I can see;"
212,JANUARY.,"Because thou art thyself, 'tis therefore I am me."
213,JANUARY.,
214,JANUARY.,17.
215,JANUARY.,
216,JANUARY.,No sickness can come near to blast my health;
217,JANUARY.,My life depends not upon any meat;
218,JANUARY.,My bread comes not from any human tilth;
219,JANUARY.,No wings will grow upon my changeless wealth;
220,JANUARY.,"Wrong cannot touch it, violence or deceit;"
221,JANUARY.,"Thou art my life, my health, my bank, my barn--"
222,JANUARY.,And from all other gods thou plain dost warn.
223,JANUARY.,
224,JANUARY.,18.
225,JANUARY.,
226,JANUARY.,Care thou for mine whom I must leave behind;
227,JANUARY.,Care that they know who 'tis for them takes care;
228,JANUARY.,Thy present patience help them still to bear;
229,JANUARY.,"Lord, keep them clearing, growing, heart and mind;"
230,JANUARY.,In one thy oneness us together bind;
231,JANUARY.,Last earthly prayer with which to thee I cling--
232,JANUARY.,"Grant that, save love, we owe not anything."
233,JANUARY.,
234,JANUARY.,19.
235,JANUARY.,
236,JANUARY.,"'Tis well, for unembodied thought a live,"
237,JANUARY.,"True house to build--of stubble, wood, nor hay;"
238,JANUARY.,"So, like bees round the flower by which they thrive,"
239,JANUARY.,"My thoughts are busy with the informing truth,"
240,JANUARY.,"And as I build, I feed, and grow in youth--"
241,JANUARY.,"Hoping to stand fresh, clean, and strong, and gay,"
242,JANUARY.,When up the east comes dawning His great day.
243,JANUARY.,
244,JANUARY.,20.
245,JANUARY.,
246,JANUARY.,"Thy will is truth--'tis therefore fate, the strong."
247,JANUARY.,Would that my will did sweep full swing with thine!
248,JANUARY.,"Then harmony with every spheric song,"
249,JANUARY.,"And conscious power, would give sureness divine."
250,JANUARY.,"Who thinks to thread thy great laws' onward throng,"
251,JANUARY.,Is as a fly that creeps his foolish way
252,JANUARY.,Athwart an engine's wheels in smooth resistless play.
253,JANUARY.,
254,JANUARY.,21.
255,JANUARY.,
256,JANUARY.,"Thou in my heart hast planted, gardener divine,"
257,JANUARY.,A scion of the tree of life: it grows;
258,JANUARY.,But not in every wind or weather it blows;
259,JANUARY.,"The leaves fall sometimes from the baby tree,"
260,JANUARY.,And the life-power seems melting into pine;
261,JANUARY.,"Yet still the sap keeps struggling to the shine,"
262,JANUARY.,And the unseen root clings cramplike unto thee.
263,JANUARY.,
264,JANUARY.,22.
265,JANUARY.,
266,JANUARY.,"Do thou, my God, my spirit's weather control;"
267,JANUARY.,"And as I do not gloom though the day be dun,"
268,JANUARY.,Let me not gloom when earth-born vapours roll
269,JANUARY.,Across the infinite zenith of my soul.
270,JANUARY.,"Should sudden brain-frost through the heart's summer run,"
271,JANUARY.,"Cold, weary, joyless, waste of air and sun,"
272,JANUARY.,"Thou art my south, my summer-wind, my all, my one."
273,JANUARY.,
274,JANUARY.,23.
275,JANUARY.,
276,JANUARY.,"O Life, why dost thou close me up in death?"
277,JANUARY.,"O Health, why make me inhabit heaviness?--"
278,JANUARY.,"I ask, yet know: the sum of this distress,"
279,JANUARY.,"Pang-haunted body, sore-dismayed mind,"
280,JANUARY.,Is but the egg that rounds the winged faith;
281,JANUARY.,"When that its path into the air shall find,"
282,JANUARY.,"My heart will follow, high above cold, rain, and wind."
283,JANUARY.,
284,JANUARY.,24.
285,JANUARY.,
286,JANUARY.,I can no more than lift my weary eyes;
287,JANUARY.,Therefore I lift my weary eyes--no more.
288,JANUARY.,"But my eyes pull my heart, and that, before"
289,JANUARY.,"'Tis well awake, knocks where the conscience lies;"
290,JANUARY.,Conscience runs quick to the spirit's hidden door:
291,JANUARY.,"Straightway, from every sky-ward window, cries"
292,JANUARY.,Up to the Father's listening ears arise.
293,JANUARY.,
294,JANUARY.,25.
295,JANUARY.,
296,JANUARY.,Not in my fancy now I search to find thee;
297,JANUARY.,Not in its loftiest forms would shape or bind thee;
298,JANUARY.,"I cry to one whom I can never know,"
299,JANUARY.,Filling me with an infinite overflow;
300,JANUARY.,"Not to a shape that dwells within my heart,"
301,JANUARY.,"Clothed in perfections love and truth assigned thee,"
302,JANUARY.,But to the God thou knowest that thou art.
303,JANUARY.,
304,JANUARY.,26.
305,JANUARY.,
306,JANUARY.,"Not, Lord, because I have done well or ill;"
307,JANUARY.,Not that my mind looks up to thee clear-eyed;
308,JANUARY.,Not that it struggles in fast cerements tied;
309,JANUARY.,Not that I need thee daily sorer still;
310,JANUARY.,"Not that I wretched, wander from thy will;"
311,JANUARY.,"Not now for any cause to thee I cry,"
312,JANUARY.,"But this, that thou art thou, and here am I."
313,JANUARY.,
314,JANUARY.,27.
315,JANUARY.,
316,JANUARY.,"Yestereve, Death came, and knocked at my thin door."
317,JANUARY.,"I from my window looked: the thing I saw,"
318,JANUARY.,"The shape uncouth, I had not seen before."
319,JANUARY.,"I was disturbed--with fear, in sooth, not awe;"
320,JANUARY.,"Whereof ashamed, I instantly did rouse"
321,JANUARY.,My will to seek thee--only to fear the more:
322,JANUARY.,Alas! I could not find thee in the house.
323,JANUARY.,
324,JANUARY.,28.
325,JANUARY.,
326,JANUARY.,I was like Peter when he began to sink.
327,JANUARY.,To thee a new prayer therefore I have got--
328,JANUARY.,"That, when Death comes in earnest to my door,"
329,JANUARY.,"Thou wouldst thyself go, when the latch doth clink,"
330,JANUARY.,"And lead him to my room, up to my cot;"
331,JANUARY.,"Then hold thy child's hand, hold and leave him not,"
332,JANUARY.,Till Death has done with him for evermore.
333,JANUARY.,
334,JANUARY.,29.
335,JANUARY.,
336,JANUARY.,"Till Death has done with him?--Ah, leave me then!"
337,JANUARY.,"And Death has done with me, oh, nevermore!"
338,JANUARY.,"He comes--and goes--to leave me in thy arms,"
339,JANUARY.,"Nearer thy heart, oh, nearer than before!"
340,JANUARY.,"To lay thy child, naked, new-born again"
341,JANUARY.,"Of mother earth, crept free through many harms,"
342,JANUARY.,Upon thy bosom--still to the very core.
343,JANUARY.,
344,JANUARY.,30.
345,JANUARY.,
346,JANUARY.,"Come to me, Lord: I will not speculate how,"
347,JANUARY.,"Nor think at which door I would have thee appear,"
348,JANUARY.,"Nor put off calling till my floors be swept,"
349,JANUARY.,"But cry, ""Come, Lord, come any way, come now."""
350,JANUARY.,"Doors, windows, I throw wide; my head I bow,"
351,JANUARY.,And sit like some one who so long has slept
352,JANUARY.,That he knows nothing till his life draw near.
353,JANUARY.,
354,JANUARY.,31.
355,JANUARY.,
356,JANUARY.,"O Lord, I have been talking to the people;"
357,JANUARY.,"Thought's wheels have round me whirled a fiery zone,"
358,JANUARY.,And the recoil of my words' airy ripple
359,JANUARY.,My heart unheedful has puffed up and blown.
360,JANUARY.,Therefore I cast myself before thee prone:
361,JANUARY.,"Lay cool hands on my burning brain, and press"
362,JANUARY.,From my weak heart the swelling emptiness.
363,JANUARY.,
364,JANUARY.,
365,JANUARY.,
366,JANUARY.,
367,JANUARY.,
368,FEBRUARY.,FEBRUARY.
369,FEBRUARY.,
370,FEBRUARY.,1.
371,FEBRUARY.,
372,FEBRUARY.,"I TO myself have neither power nor worth,"
373,FEBRUARY.,"Patience nor love, nor anything right good;"
374,FEBRUARY.,"My soul is a poor land, plenteous in dearth--"
375,FEBRUARY.,"Here blades of grass, there a small herb for food--"
376,FEBRUARY.,A nothing that would be something if it could;
377,FEBRUARY.,"But if obedience, Lord, in me do grow,"
378,FEBRUARY.,I shall one day be better than I know.
379,FEBRUARY.,
380,FEBRUARY.,2.
381,FEBRUARY.,
382,FEBRUARY.,The worst power of an evil mood is this--
383,FEBRUARY.,"It makes the bastard self seem in the right,"
384,FEBRUARY.,"Self, self the end, the goal of human bliss."
385,FEBRUARY.,But if the Christ-self in us be the might
386,FEBRUARY.,"Of saving God, why should I spend my force"
387,FEBRUARY.,With a dark thing to reason of the light--
388,FEBRUARY.,"Not push it rough aside, and hold obedient course?"
389,FEBRUARY.,
390,FEBRUARY.,3.
391,FEBRUARY.,
392,FEBRUARY.,Back still it comes to this: there was a man
393,FEBRUARY.,"Who said, ""I am the truth, the life, the way:""--"
394,FEBRUARY.,"Shall I pass on, or shall I stop and hear?--"
395,FEBRUARY.,"""Come to the Father but by me none can:"""
396,FEBRUARY.,What then is this?--am I not also one
397,FEBRUARY.,Of those who live in fatherless dismay?
398,FEBRUARY.,"I stand, I look, I listen, I draw near."
399,FEBRUARY.,
400,FEBRUARY.,4.
401,FEBRUARY.,
402,FEBRUARY.,"My Lord, I find that nothing else will do,"
403,FEBRUARY.,"But follow where thou goest, sit at thy feet,"
404,FEBRUARY.,"And where I have thee not, still run to meet."
405,FEBRUARY.,"Roses are scentless, hopeless are the morns,"
406,FEBRUARY.,"Rest is but weakness, laughter crackling thorns,"
407,FEBRUARY.,"If thou, the Truth, do not make them the true:"
408,FEBRUARY.,"Thou art my life, O Christ, and nothing else will do."
409,FEBRUARY.,
410,FEBRUARY.,5.
411,FEBRUARY.,
412,FEBRUARY.,"Thou art here--in heaven, I know, but not from here--"
413,FEBRUARY.,Although thy separate self do not appear;
414,FEBRUARY.,"If I could part the light from out the day,"
415,FEBRUARY.,There I should have thee! But thou art too near:
416,FEBRUARY.,"How find thee walking, when thou art the way?"
417,FEBRUARY.,"Oh, present Christ! make my eyes keen as stings,"
418,FEBRUARY.,"To see thee at their heart, the glory even of things."
419,FEBRUARY.,
420,FEBRUARY.,6.
421,FEBRUARY.,
422,FEBRUARY.,"That thou art nowhere to be found, agree"
423,FEBRUARY.,"Wise men, whose eyes are but for surfaces;"
424,FEBRUARY.,"Men with eyes opened by the second birth,"
425,FEBRUARY.,"To whom the seen, husk of the unseen is,"
426,FEBRUARY.,Descry thee soul of everything on earth.
427,FEBRUARY.,"Who know thy ends, thy means and motions see:"
428,FEBRUARY.,Eyes made for glory soon discover thee.
429,FEBRUARY.,
430,FEBRUARY.,7.
431,FEBRUARY.,
432,FEBRUARY.,"Thou near then, I draw nearer--to thy feet,"
433,FEBRUARY.,"And sitting in thy shadow, look out on the shine;"
434,FEBRUARY.,Ready at thy first word to leave my seat--
435,FEBRUARY.,Not thee: thou goest too. From every clod
436,FEBRUARY.,Into thy footprint flows the indwelling wine;
437,FEBRUARY.,"And in my daily bread, keen-eyed I greet"
438,FEBRUARY.,"Its being's heart, the very body of God."
439,FEBRUARY.,
440,FEBRUARY.,8.
441,FEBRUARY.,
442,FEBRUARY.,"Thou wilt interpret life to me, and men,"
443,FEBRUARY.,"Art, nature, yea, my own soul's mysteries--"
444,FEBRUARY.,"Bringing, truth out, clear-joyous, to my ken,"
445,FEBRUARY.,Fair as the morn trampling the dull night. Then
446,FEBRUARY.,The lone hill-side shall hear exultant cries;
447,FEBRUARY.,"The joyous see me joy, the weeping weep;"
448,FEBRUARY.,"The watching smile, as Death breathes on me his cold sleep."
449,FEBRUARY.,
450,FEBRUARY.,9.
451,FEBRUARY.,
452,FEBRUARY.,"I search my heart--I search, and find no faith."
453,FEBRUARY.,Hidden He may be in its many folds--
454,FEBRUARY.,I see him not revealed in all the world
455,FEBRUARY.,Duty's firm shape thins to a misty wraith.
456,FEBRUARY.,No good seems likely. To and fro I am hurled.
457,FEBRUARY.,I have no stay. Only obedience holds:--
458,FEBRUARY.,"I haste, I rise, I do the thing he saith."
459,FEBRUARY.,
460,FEBRUARY.,10.
461,FEBRUARY.,
462,FEBRUARY.,Thou wouldst not have thy man crushed back to clay;
463,FEBRUARY.,"It must be, God, thou hast a strength to give"
464,FEBRUARY.,To him that fain would do what thou dost say;
465,FEBRUARY.,"Else how shall any soul repentant live,"
466,FEBRUARY.,Old griefs and new fears hurrying on dismay?
467,FEBRUARY.,"Let pain be what thou wilt, kind and degree,"
468,FEBRUARY.,Only in pain calm thou my heart with thee.
469,FEBRUARY.,
470,FEBRUARY.,11.
471,FEBRUARY.,
472,FEBRUARY.,"I will not shift my ground like Moab's king,"
473,FEBRUARY.,"But from this spot whereon I stand, I pray--"
474,FEBRUARY.,"From this same barren rock to thee I say,"
475,FEBRUARY.,"""Lord, in my commonness, in this very thing"
476,FEBRUARY.,That haunts my soul with folly--through the clay
477,FEBRUARY.,"Of this my pitcher, see the lamp's dim flake;"
478,FEBRUARY.,"And hear the blow that would the pitcher break."""
479,FEBRUARY.,
480,FEBRUARY.,12.
481,FEBRUARY.,
482,FEBRUARY.,Be thou the well by which I lie and rest;
483,FEBRUARY.,"Be thou my tree of life, my garden ground;"
484,FEBRUARY.,"Be thou my home, my fire, my chamber blest,"
485,FEBRUARY.,"My book of wisdom, loved of all the best;"
486,FEBRUARY.,"Oh, be my friend, each day still newer found,"
487,FEBRUARY.,As the eternal days and nights go round!
488,FEBRUARY.,"Nay, nay--thou art my God, in whom all loves are bound!"

980,APRIL.,APRIL.
981,APRIL.,
982,APRIL.,1.
983,APRIL.,
984,APRIL.,"LORD, I do choose the higher than my will."
985,APRIL.,I would be handled by thy nursing arms
986,APRIL.,"After thy will, not my infant alarms."
987,APRIL.,"Hurt me thou wilt--but then more loving still,"
988,APRIL.,"If more can be and less, in love's perfect zone!"
989,APRIL.,"My fancy shrinks from least of all thy harms,"
990,APRIL.,But do thy will with me--I am thine own.
991,APRIL.,
992,APRIL.,2.
993,APRIL.,
994,APRIL.,Some things wilt thou not one day turn to dreams?
995,APRIL.,Some dreams wilt thou not one day turn to fact?
996,APRIL.,"The thing that painful, more than should be, seems,"
997,APRIL.,Shall not thy sliding years with them retract--
998,APRIL.,Shall fair realities not counteract?
999,APRIL.,The thing that was well dreamed of bliss and joy--
1000,APRIL.,Wilt thou not breathe thy life into the toy?
1001,APRIL.,
1002,APRIL.,3.
1003,APRIL.,
1004,APRIL.,"I have had dreams of absolute delight,"
1005,APRIL.,"Beyond all waking bliss--only of grass,"
1006,APRIL.,"Flowers, wind, a peak, a limb of marble white;"
1007,APRIL.,"They dwell with me like things half come to pass,"
1008,APRIL.,"True prophecies:--when I with thee am right,"
1009,APRIL.,"If I pray, waking, for such a joy of sight,"
1010,APRIL.,"Thou with the gold, wilt not refuse the brass."
1011,APRIL.,
1012,APRIL.,4.
1013,APRIL.,
1014,APRIL.,I think I shall not ever pray for such;
1015,APRIL.,"Thy bliss will overflood my heart and brain,"
1016,APRIL.,And I want no unripe things back again.
1017,APRIL.,"Love ever fresher, lovelier than of old--"
1018,APRIL.,How should it want its more exchanged for much?
1019,APRIL.,"Love will not backward sigh, but forward strain,"
1020,APRIL.,"On in the tale still telling, never told."
1021,APRIL.,
1022,APRIL.,5.
1023,APRIL.,
1024,APRIL.,"What has been, shall not only be, but is."
1025,APRIL.,"The hues of dreamland, strange and sweet and tender"
1026,APRIL.,Are but hint-shadows of full many a splendour
1027,APRIL.,Which the high Parent-love will yet unroll
1028,APRIL.,"Before his child's obedient, humble soul."
1029,APRIL.,"Ah, me, my God! in thee lies every bliss"
1030,APRIL.,Whose shadow men go hunting wearily amiss.
1031,APRIL.,
1032,APRIL.,6.
1033,APRIL.,
1034,APRIL.,"Now, ere I sleep, I wonder what I shall dream."
1035,APRIL.,"Some sense of being, utter new, may come"
1036,APRIL.,Into my soul while I am blind and dumb--
1037,APRIL.,"With shapes and airs and scents which dark hours teem,"
1038,APRIL.,"Of other sort than those that haunt the day,"
1039,APRIL.,"Hinting at precious things, ages away"
1040,APRIL.,In the long tale of us God to himself doth say.
1041,APRIL.,
1042,APRIL.,7.
1043,APRIL.,
1044,APRIL.,"Late, in a dream, an unknown lady I saw"
1045,APRIL.,Stand on a tomb; down she to me stepped thence.
1046,APRIL.,"""They tell me,"" quoth I, ""thou art one of the dead!"""
1047,APRIL.,And scarce believed for gladness the yea she said;
1048,APRIL.,"A strange auroral bliss, an arctic awe,"
1049,APRIL.,"A new, outworldish joy awoke intense,"
1050,APRIL.,To think I talked with one that verily was dead.
1051,APRIL.,
1052,APRIL.,8.
1053,APRIL.,
1054,APRIL.,"Thou dost demand our love, holy Lord Christ,"
1055,APRIL.,And batest nothing of thy modesty;--
1056,APRIL.,Thou know'st no other way to bliss the highest
1057,APRIL.,"Than loving thee, the loving, perfectly."
1058,APRIL.,Thou lovest perfectly--that is thy bliss:
1059,APRIL.,"We must love like thee, or our being miss--"
1060,APRIL.,"So, to love perfectly, love perfect Love, love thee."
1061,APRIL.,
1062,APRIL.,9.
1063,APRIL.,
1064,APRIL.,"Here is my heart, O Christ; thou know'st I love thee."
1065,APRIL.,But wretched is the thing I call my love.
1066,APRIL.,"O Love divine, rise up in me and move me--"
1067,APRIL.,I follow surely when thou first dost move.
1068,APRIL.,"To love the perfect love, is primal, mere"
1069,APRIL.,"Necessity; and he who holds life dear,"
1070,APRIL.,Must love thee every hope and heart above.
1071,APRIL.,
1072,APRIL.,10.
1073,APRIL.,
1074,APRIL.,Might I but scatter interfering things--
1075,APRIL.,"Questions and doubts, distrusts and anxious pride,"
1076,APRIL.,"And in thy garment, as under gathering wings,"
1077,APRIL.,"Nestle obedient to thy loving side,"
1078,APRIL.,Easy it were to love thee. But when thou
1079,APRIL.,"Send'st me to think and labour from thee wide,"
1080,APRIL.,Love falls to asking many a why and how.
1081,APRIL.,
1082,APRIL.,11.
1083,APRIL.,
1084,APRIL.,"Easier it were, but poorer were the love."
1085,APRIL.,"Lord, I would have me love thee from the deeps--"
1086,APRIL.,"Of troubled thought, of pain, of weariness."
1087,APRIL.,"Through seething wastes below, billows above,"
1088,APRIL.,"My soul should rise in eager, hungering leaps;"
1089,APRIL.,"Through thorny thicks, through sands unstable press--"
1090,APRIL.,Out of my dream to him who slumbers not nor sleeps.
1091,APRIL.,
1092,APRIL.,12.
1093,APRIL.,
1094,APRIL.,I do not fear the greatness of thy command--
1095,APRIL.,To keep heart-open-house to brother men;
1096,APRIL.,"But till in thy God's love perfect I stand,"
1097,APRIL.,My door not wide enough will open. Then
1098,APRIL.,Each man will be love-awful in my sight;
1099,APRIL.,"And, open to the eternal morning's might,"
1100,APRIL.,Each human face will shine my window for thy light.
1101,APRIL.,
1102,APRIL.,13.
1103,APRIL.,
1104,APRIL.,Make me all patience and all diligence;
1105,APRIL.,"Patience, that thou mayst have thy time with me;"
1106,APRIL.,"Diligence, that I waste not thy expense"
1107,APRIL.,In sending out to bring me home to thee.
1108,APRIL.,What though thy work in me transcends my sense--
1109,APRIL.,"Too fine, too high, for me to understand--"
1110,APRIL.,"I hope entirely. On, Lord, with thy labour grand."
1111,APRIL.,
1112,APRIL.,14.
1113,APRIL.,
1114,APRIL.,"Lest I be humbled at the last, and told"
1115,APRIL.,That my great labour was but for my peace
1116,APRIL.,"That not for love or truth had I been bold,"
1117,APRIL.,But merely for a prisoned heart's release;
1118,APRIL.,"Careful, I humble me now before thy feet:"
1119,APRIL.,"Whate'er I be, I cry, and will not cease--"
1120,APRIL.,"Let me not perish, though favour be not meet."
1121,APRIL.,
1122,APRIL.,15.
1123,APRIL.,
1124,APRIL.,"For, what I seek thou knowest I must find,"
1125,APRIL.,Or miserably die for lack of love.
1126,APRIL.,"I justify thee: what is in thy mind,"
1127,APRIL.,"If it be shame to me, all shame above."
1128,APRIL.,Thou know'st I choose it--know'st I would not shove
1129,APRIL.,The hand away that stripped me for the rod--
1130,APRIL.,"If so it pleased my Life, my love-made-angry God."
1131,APRIL.,
1132,APRIL.,16.
1133,APRIL.,
1134,APRIL.,"I see a door, a multitude near by,"
1135,APRIL.,"In creed and quarrel, sure disciples all!"
1136,APRIL.,"Gladly they would, they say, enter the hall,"
1137,APRIL.,"But cannot, the stone threshold is so high."
1138,APRIL.,"From unseen hand, full many a feeding crumb,"
1139,APRIL.,Slow dropping o'er the threshold high doth come:
1140,APRIL.,"They gather and eat, with much disputing hum."
1141,APRIL.,
1142,APRIL.,17.
1143,APRIL.,
1144,APRIL.,"Still and anon, a loud clear voice doth call--"
1145,APRIL.,"""Make your feet clean, and enter so the hall."""
1146,APRIL.,"They hear, they stoop, they gather each a crumb."
1147,APRIL.,Oh the deaf people! would they were also dumb!
1148,APRIL.,"Hear how they talk, and lack of Christ deplore,"
1149,APRIL.,"Stamping with muddy feet about the door,"
1150,APRIL.,And will not wipe them clean to walk upon his floor!
1151,APRIL.,
1152,APRIL.,18.
1153,APRIL.,
1154,APRIL.,"But see, one comes; he listens to the voice;"
1155,APRIL.,Careful he wipes his weary dusty feet!
1156,APRIL.,The voice hath spoken--to him is left no choice;
1157,APRIL.,He hurries to obey--that only is meet.
1158,APRIL.,"Low sinks the threshold, levelled with the ground;"
1159,APRIL.,The man leaps in--to liberty he's bound.
1160,APRIL.,"The rest go talking, walking, picking round."
1161,APRIL.,
1162,APRIL.,19.
1163,APRIL.,
1164,APRIL.,"If I, thus writing, rebuke my neighbour dull,"
1165,APRIL.,"And talk, and write, and enter not the door,"
1166,APRIL.,"Than all the rest I wrong Christ tenfold more,"
1167,APRIL.,Making his gift of vision void and null.
1168,APRIL.,"Help me this day to be thy humble sheep,"
1169,APRIL.,"Eating thy grass, and following, thou before;"
1170,APRIL.,"From wolfish lies my life, O Shepherd, keep."
1171,APRIL.,
1172,APRIL.,20.
1173,APRIL.,
1174,APRIL.,"God, help me, dull of heart, to trust in thee."
1175,APRIL.,Thou art the father of me--not any mood
1176,APRIL.,"Can part me from the One, the verily Good."
1177,APRIL.,When fog and failure o'er my being brood.
1178,APRIL.,"When life looks but a glimmering marshy clod,"
1179,APRIL.,No fire out flashing from the living God--
1180,APRIL.,"Then, then, to rest in faith were worthy victory!"
1181,APRIL.,
1182,APRIL.,21.
1183,APRIL.,
1184,APRIL.,"To trust is gain and growth, not mere sown seed!"
1185,APRIL.,"Faith heaves the world round to the heavenly dawn,"
1186,APRIL.,In whose great light the soul doth spell and read
1187,APRIL.,"Itself high-born, its being derived and drawn"
1188,APRIL.,From the eternal self-existent fire;
1189,APRIL.,"Then, mazed with joy of its own heavenly breed,"
1190,APRIL.,Exultant-humble falls before its awful sire.
1191,APRIL.,
1192,APRIL.,22.
1193,APRIL.,
1194,APRIL.,"Art thou not, Jesus, busy like to us?"
1195,APRIL.,"Thee shall I image as one sitting still,"
1196,APRIL.,"Ordering all things in thy potent will,"
1197,APRIL.,"Silent, and thinking ever to thy father,"
1198,APRIL.,Whose thought through thee flows multitudinous?
1199,APRIL.,"Or shall I think of thee as journeying, rather,"
1200,APRIL.,"Ceaseless through space, because thou everything dost fill?"
1201,APRIL.,
1202,APRIL.,23.
1203,APRIL.,
1204,APRIL.,"That all things thou dost fill, I well may think--"
1205,APRIL.,Thy power doth reach me in so many ways.
1206,APRIL.,"Thou who in one the universe dost bind,"
1207,APRIL.,Passest through all the channels of my mind;
1208,APRIL.,"The sun of thought, across the farthest brink"
1209,APRIL.,Of consciousness thou sendest me thy rays;
1210,APRIL.,Nor drawest them in when lost in sleep I sink.
1211,APRIL.,
1212,APRIL.,24.
1213,APRIL.,
1214,APRIL.,"So common are thy paths, thy coming seems"
1215,APRIL.,Only another phase oft of my me;
1216,APRIL.,"But nearer is my I, O Lord, to thee,"
1217,APRIL.,Than is my I to what itself it deems;
1218,APRIL.,"How better then couldst thou, O master, come,"
1219,APRIL.,"Than from thy home across into my home,"
1220,APRIL.,Straight o'er the marches that I cannot see!
1221,APRIL.,
1222,APRIL.,25.
1223,APRIL.,
1224,APRIL.,"Marches?--'Twixt thee and me there's no division,"
1225,APRIL.,"Except the meeting of thy will and mine,"
1226,APRIL.,"The loves that love, the wills that will the same."
1227,APRIL.,Where thine meets mine is my life's true condition;
1228,APRIL.,"Yea, only there it burns with any flame."
1229,APRIL.,Thy will but holds me to my life's fruition.
1230,APRIL.,"O God, I would--I have no mine that is not thine."
1231,APRIL.,
1232,APRIL.,26.
1233,APRIL.,
1234,APRIL.,"I look for thee, and do not see thee come.--"
1235,APRIL.,"If I could see thee, 'twere a commoner thing,"
1236,APRIL.,And shallower comfort would thy coming bring.
1237,APRIL.,"Earth, sea, and air lie round me moveless dumb,"
1238,APRIL.,"Never a tremble, an expectant hum,"
1239,APRIL.,To tell the Lord of Hearts is drawing near:
1240,APRIL.,"Lo! in the looking eyes, the looked for Lord is here."
1241,APRIL.,
1242,APRIL.,27.
1243,APRIL.,
1244,APRIL.,I take a comfort from my very badness:
1245,APRIL.,It is for lack of thee that I am bad.
1246,APRIL.,"How close, how infinitely closer yet"
1247,APRIL.,"Must I come to thee, ere I can pay one debt"
1248,APRIL.,Which mere humanity has on me set!
1249,APRIL.,"""How close to thee!""--no wonder, soul, thou art glad!"
1250,APRIL.,Oneness with him is the eternal gladness.
1251,APRIL.,
1252,APRIL.,28.
1253,APRIL.,
1254,APRIL.,What can there be so close as making and made?
1255,APRIL.,Nought twinned can be so near; thou art more nigh
1256,APRIL.,"To me, my God, than is this thinking I"
1257,APRIL.,To that I mean when I by me is said;
1258,APRIL.,"Thou art more near me, than is my ready will"
1259,APRIL.,"Near to my love, though both one place do fill;--"
1260,APRIL.,"Yet, till we are one,--Ah me! the long until!"
1261,APRIL.,
1262,APRIL.,29.
1263,APRIL.,
1264,APRIL.,Then shall my heart behold thee everywhere.
1265,APRIL.,"The vision rises of a speechless thing,"
1266,APRIL.,A perfectness of bliss beyond compare!
1267,APRIL.,"A time when I nor breathe nor think nor move,"
1268,APRIL.,"But I do breathe and think and feel thy love,"
1269,APRIL.,The soul of all the songs the saints do sing!--
1270,APRIL.,"And life dies out in bliss, to come again in prayer."
1271,APRIL.,
1272,APRIL.,30.
1273,APRIL.,
1274,APRIL.,"In the great glow of that great love, this death"
1275,APRIL.,Would melt away like a fantastic cloud;
1276,APRIL.,I should no more shrink from it than from the breath
1277,APRIL.,That makes in the frosty air a nimbus-shroud;
1278,APRIL.,"Thou, Love, hast conquered death, and I aloud"
1279,APRIL.,"Should triumph over him, with thy saintly crowd,"
1280,APRIL.,That where the Lamb goes ever followeth.

1289,MAY.,
1290,MAY.,WHAT though my words glance sideways from the thing
1291,MAY.,"Which I would utter in thine ear, my sire!"
1292,MAY.,Truth in the inward parts thou dost desire--
1293,MAY.,"Wise hunger, not a fitness fine of speech:"
1294,MAY.,The little child that clamouring fails to reach
1295,MAY.,"With upstretched hand the fringe of her attire,"
1296,MAY.,Yet meets the mother's hand down hurrying.
1297,MAY.,
1298,MAY.,2.
1299,MAY.,
1300,MAY.,"Even when their foolish words they turned on him,"
1301,MAY.,He did not his disciples send away;
1302,MAY.,"He knew their hearts were foolish, eyes were dim,"
1303,MAY.,And therefore by his side needs must they stay.
1304,MAY.,"Thou will not, Lord, send me away from thee."
1305,MAY.,"When I am foolish, make thy cock crow grim;"

1309,MAY.,
1310,MAY.,Another day of gloom and slanting rain!
1311,MAY.,"Of closed skies, cold winds, and blight and bane!"
1312,MAY.,"Such not the weather, Lord, which thou art fain"
1313,MAY.,"To give thy chosen, sweet to heart and brain!--"
1314,MAY.,"Until we mourn, thou keep'st the merry tune;"
1315,MAY.,"Thy hand unloved its pleasure must restrain,"
1316,MAY.,Nor spoil both gift and child by lavishing too soon.
1317,MAY.,

1320,MAY.,"But all things shall be ours! Up, heart, and sing."
1321,MAY.,All things were made for us--we are God's heirs--
1322,MAY.,"Moon, sun, and wildest comets that do trail"
1323,MAY.,A crowd of small worlds for a swiftness-tail!
1324,MAY.,"Up from Thy depths in me, my child-heart bring--"
1325,MAY.,The child alone inherits anything:
1326,MAY.,God's little children-gods--all things are theirs!
1327,MAY.,
1328,MAY.,5.
1329,MAY.,
1330,MAY.,Thy great deliverance is a greater thing
1331,MAY.,Than purest imagination can foregrasp;
1332,MAY.,"A thing beyond all conscious hungering,"
1333,MAY.,Beyond all hope that makes the poet sing.
1334,MAY.,"It takes the clinging world, undoes its clasp,"
1335,MAY.,"Floats it afar upon a mighty sea,"
1336,MAY.,And leaves us quiet with love and liberty and thee.

1342,MAY.,"Warm, soft, and dewy, filled with flowery eyes,"
1343,MAY.,"And gentle, murmuring motions everywhere--"
1344,MAY.,"Of life in heart, and tree, and brook, and moss;"
1345,MAY.,"Thy breath wakes beauty, love, and bliss, and prayer,"
1346,MAY.,And strength to hang with nails upon thy cross.
1347,MAY.,
1348,MAY.,7.
1349,MAY.,
1350,MAY.,"If thou hadst closed my life in seed and husk,"
1351,MAY.,"And cast me into soft, warm, damp, dark mould,"
1352,MAY.,"All unaware of light come through the dusk,"
1353,MAY.,"I yet should feel the split of each shelly fold,"
1354,MAY.,"Should feel the growing of my prisoned heart,"
1355,MAY.,"And dully dream of being slow unrolled,"
1356,MAY.,And in some other vagueness taking part.
1357,MAY.,
1358,MAY.,8.
1359,MAY.,
1360,MAY.,And little as the world I should foreknow
1361,MAY.,Up into which I was about to rise--

1363,MAY.,"How it would greet me, how its wind would blow--"
1364,MAY.,"As little, it may be, I do know the good"

1372,MAY.,"I can be patient for all coming songs,"
1373,MAY.,But let me sing my one monotonous song.
1374,MAY.,To me the time is slow my mould among;
1375,MAY.,To quicker life I fain would spur and start
1376,MAY.,The aching growth at my dull-swelling heart.
1377,MAY.,

1379,MAY.,
1380,MAY.,Christ is the pledge that I shall one day see;

1438,MAY.,16.
1439,MAY.,
1440,MAY.,I would go near thee--but I cannot press
1441,MAY.,Into thy presence--it helps not to presume.
1442,MAY.,Thy doors are deeds; the handles are their doing.
1443,MAY.,"He whose day-life is obedient righteousness,"
1444,MAY.,"Who, after failure, or a poor success,"

1449,MAY.,
1450,MAY.,"Lord, thou hast carried me through this evening's duty;"
1451,MAY.,"I am released, weary, and well content."
1452,MAY.,"O soul, put on the evening dress of beauty,"
1453,MAY.,"Thy sunset-flush, of gold and purple blent!--"
1454,MAY.,"Alas, the moment I turn to my heart,"
1455,MAY.,"Feeling runs out of doors, or stands apart!"

1470,MAY.,"O Christ, my life, possess me utterly."
1471,MAY.,Take me and make a little Christ of me.
1472,MAY.,"If I am anything but thy father's son,"

1484,MAY.,Many will rather lie among the slain

1489,MAY.,
1490,MAY.,"But he who would be born again indeed,"

1529,MAY.,
1530,MAY.,A loving word may set some door ajar

1539,MAY.,
1540,MAY.,"My prayers, my God, flow from what I am not;"

1550,MAY.,"So bound in selfishness am I, so chained,"

1552,MAY.,"But know not what, full-fraught, the word doth mean."
1553,MAY.,By loss on loss I have severely gained
1554,MAY.,Wisdom enough my slavery to see;
1555,MAY.,"But liberty, pure, absolute, serene,"
1556,MAY.,No freëst-visioned slave has ever seen.

1586,MAY.,"Please, Lord, let thy disciple understand."
1587,MAY.,
1588,MAY.,31.

1762,JUNE.,To some a hunger that will not depart.
1763,JUNE.,
1764,JUNE.,17.

1768,JUNE.,"A gaze, at dusky night and clearing morn,"
1769,JUNE.,As on a land of emptiness and dearth;
1770,JUNE.,To some a bitter sorrow; to some the sting

1911,JULY.,
1912,JULY.,"ALAS, my tent! see through it a whirlwind sweep!"
1913,JULY.,"Moaning, poor Fancy's doves are swept away."
1914,JULY.,"I sit alone, a sorrow half asleep,"
1915,JULY.,My consciousness the blackness all astir.
1916,JULY.,"No pilgrim I, a homeless wanderer--"
1917,JULY.,"For how canst Thou be in the darkness deep,"
1918,JULY.,Who dwellest only in the living day?
1919,JULY.,
1920,JULY.,2.
1921,JULY.,
1922,JULY.,"It must be, somewhere in my fluttering tent,"
1923,JULY.,"Strange creatures, half tamed only yet, are pent--"
1924,JULY.,"Dragons, lop-winged birds, and large-eyed snakes!"
1925,JULY.,Hark! through the storm the saddest howling breaks!
1926,JULY.,"Or are they loose, roaming about the bent,"
1927,JULY.,The darkness dire deepening with moan and scream?--
1928,JULY.,"My Morning, rise, and all shall be a dream."
1929,JULY.,
1930,JULY.,3.
1931,JULY.,
1932,JULY.,"Not thine, my Lord, the darkness all is mine--"
1933,JULY.,"Save that, as mine, my darkness too is thine:"
1934,JULY.,All things are thine to save or to destroy--
1935,JULY.,"Destroy my darkness, rise my perfect joy;"
1936,JULY.,"Love primal, the live coal of every night,"
1937,JULY.,"Flame out, scare the ill things with radiant fright,"
1938,JULY.,And fill my tent with laughing morn's delight.
1939,JULY.,
1940,JULY.,4.
1941,JULY.,
1942,JULY.,"Master, thou workest with such common things--"
1943,JULY.,"Low souls, weak hearts, I mean--and hast to use,"
1944,JULY.,"Therefore, such common means and rescuings,"
1945,JULY.,"That hard we find it, as we sit and muse,"
1946,JULY.,To think thou workest in us verily:
1947,JULY.,"Bad sea-boats we, and manned with wretched crews--"
1948,JULY.,"That doubt the captain, watch the storm-spray flee."
1949,JULY.,
1950,JULY.,5.
1951,JULY.,
1952,JULY.,Thou art hampered in thy natural working then
1953,JULY.,When beings designed on freedom's holy plan
1954,JULY.,"Will not be free: with thy poor, foolish men,"
1955,JULY.,Thou therefore hast to work just like a man.
1956,JULY.,"But when, tangling thyself in their sore need,"
1957,JULY.,"Thou hast to freedom fashioned them indeed,"
1958,JULY.,"Then wilt thou grandly move, and Godlike speed."
1959,JULY.,
1960,JULY.,6.
1961,JULY.,
1962,JULY.,Will this not then show grandest fact of all--
1963,JULY.,In thy creation victory most renowned--
1964,JULY.,"That thou hast wrought thy will by slow and small,"
1965,JULY.,"And made men like thee, though thy making bound"
1966,JULY.,"By that which they were not, and could not be"
1967,JULY.,Until thou mad'st them make along with thee?--
1968,JULY.,"Master, the tardiness is but in me."
1969,JULY.,
1970,JULY.,7.
1971,JULY.,
1972,JULY.,Hence come thy checks--because I still would run
1973,JULY.,"My head into the sand, nor flutter aloft"
1974,JULY.,"Towards thy home, with thy wind under me."
1975,JULY.,"'Tis because I am mean, thy ways so oft"
1976,JULY.,Look mean to me; my rise is low begun;
1977,JULY.,"But scarce thy will doth grasp me, ere I see,"
1978,JULY.,"For my arrest and rise, its stern necessity."
1979,JULY.,
1980,JULY.,8.
1981,JULY.,
1982,JULY.,Like clogs upon the pinions of thy plan
1983,JULY.,"We hang--like captives on thy chariot-wheels,"
1984,JULY.,Who should climb up and ride with Death's conqueror;
1985,JULY.,Therefore thy train along the world's highway steals
1986,JULY.,So slow to the peace of heart-reluctant man.
1987,JULY.,"What shall we do to spread the wing and soar,"
1988,JULY.,Nor straiten thy deliverance any more?
1989,JULY.,
1990,JULY.,9.
1991,JULY.,
1992,JULY.,"The sole way to put flight into the wing,"
1993,JULY.,"To preen its feathers, and to make them grow,"
1994,JULY.,Is to heed humbly every smallest thing
1995,JULY.,With which the Christ in us has aught to do.
1996,JULY.,"So will the Christ from child to manhood go,"
1997,JULY.,"Obedient to the father Christ, and so"
1998,JULY.,Sweet holy change will turn all our old things to new.
1999,JULY.,
2000,JULY.,10.
2001,JULY.,
2002,JULY.,"Creation thou dost work by faint degrees,"
2003,JULY.,By shade and shadow from unseen beginning;
2004,JULY.,"Far, far apart, in unthought mysteries"
2005,JULY.,"Of thy own dark, unfathomable seas,"
2006,JULY.,"Thou will'st thy will; and thence, upon the earth--"
2007,JULY.,"Slow travelling, his way through centuries winning--"
2008,JULY.,A child at length arrives at never ending birth.
2009,JULY.,
2010,JULY.,11.
2011,JULY.,
2012,JULY.,Well mayst thou then work on indocile hearts
2013,JULY.,"By small successes, disappointments small;"
2014,JULY.,"By nature, weather, failure, or sore fall;"
2015,JULY.,"By shame, anxiety, bitterness, and smarts;"
2016,JULY.,"By loneliness, by weary loss of zest:--"
2017,JULY.,"The rags, the husks, the swine, the hunger-quest,"
2018,JULY.,Drive home the wanderer to the father's breast.
2019,JULY.,
2020,JULY.,12.
2021,JULY.,
2022,JULY.,How suddenly some rapid turn of thought
2023,JULY.,"May throw the life-machine all out of gear,"
2024,JULY.,"Clouding the windows with the steam of doubt,"
2025,JULY.,"Filling the eyes with dust, with noise the ear!"
2026,JULY.,"Who knows not then where dwells the engineer,"
2027,JULY.,"Rushes aghast into the pathless night,"
2028,JULY.,And wanders in a land of dreary fright.
2029,JULY.,
2030,JULY.,13.
2031,JULY.,
2032,JULY.,"Amazed at sightless whirring of their wheels,"
2033,JULY.,"Confounded with the recklessness and strife,"
2034,JULY.,"Distract with fears of what may next ensue,"
2035,JULY.,"Some break rude exit from the house of life,"
2036,JULY.,And plunge into a silence out of view--
2037,JULY.,"Whence not a cry, no wafture once reveals"
2038,JULY.,What door they have broke open with the knife.
2039,JULY.,
2040,JULY.,14.
2041,JULY.,
2042,JULY.,"Help me, my Father, in whatever dismay,"
2043,JULY.,"Whatever terror in whatever shape,"
2044,JULY.,To hold the faster by thy garment's hem;
2045,JULY.,"When my heart sinks, oh, lift it up, I pray;"
2046,JULY.,"Thy child should never fear though hell should gape,"
2047,JULY.,Not blench though all the ills that men affray
2048,JULY.,Stood round him like the Roman round Jerusalem.
2049,JULY.,
2050,JULY.,15.
2051,JULY.,
2052,JULY.,Too eager I must not be to understand.
2053,JULY.,How should the work the master goes about
2054,JULY.,Fit the vague sketch my compasses have planned?
2055,JULY.,I am his house--for him to go in and out.
2056,JULY.,He builds me now--and if I cannot see
2057,JULY.,"At any time what he is doing with me,"
2058,JULY.,'Tis that he makes the house for me too grand.
2059,JULY.,
2060,JULY.,16.
2061,JULY.,
2062,JULY.,The house is not for me--it is for him.
2063,JULY.,"His royal thoughts require many a stair,"
2064,JULY.,"Many a tower, many an outlook fair,"
2065,JULY.,"Of which I have no thought, and need no care."
2066,JULY.,"Where I am most perplexed, it may be there"
2067,JULY.,"Thou mak'st a secret chamber, holy-dim,"
2068,JULY.,Where thou wilt come to help my deepest prayer.
2069,JULY.,
2070,JULY.,17.
2071,JULY.,
2072,JULY.,I cannot tell why this day I am ill;
2073,JULY.,But I am well because it is thy will--
2074,JULY.,Which is to make me pure and right like thee.
2075,JULY.,Not yet I need escape--'tis bearable
2076,JULY.,Because thou knowest. And when harder things
2077,JULY.,"Shall rise and gather, and overshadow me,"
2078,JULY.,I shall have comfort in thy strengthenings.
2079,JULY.,
2080,JULY.,18.
2081,JULY.,
2082,JULY.,How do I live when thou art far away?--
2083,JULY.,"When I am sunk, and lost, and dead in sleep,"
2084,JULY.,Or in some dream with no sense in its play?
2085,JULY.,"When weary-dull, or drowned in study deep?--"
2086,JULY.,"O Lord, I live so utterly on thee,"
2087,JULY.,I live when I forget thee utterly--
2088,JULY.,"Not that thou thinkest of, but thinkest me."
2089,JULY.,
2090,JULY.,19.
2091,JULY.,
2092,JULY.,Thou far!--that word the holy truth doth blur.
2093,JULY.,Doth the great ocean from the small fish run
2094,JULY.,When it sleeps fast in its low weedy bower?
2095,JULY.,"Is the sun far from any smallest flower,"
2096,JULY.,That lives by his dear presence every hour?
2097,JULY.,Are they not one in oneness without stir--
2098,JULY.,The flower the flower because the sun the sun?
2099,JULY.,
2100,JULY.,20.
2101,JULY.,
2102,JULY.,"""Dear presence every hour""!--what of the night,"
2103,JULY.,When crumpled daisies shut gold sadness in;
2104,JULY.,"And some do hang the head for lack of light,"
2105,JULY.,Sick almost unto death with absence-blight?--
2106,JULY.,"Thy memory then, warm-lingering in the ground,"
2107,JULY.,"Mourned dewy in the air, keeps their hearts sound,"
2108,JULY.,Till fresh with day their lapsed life begin.
2109,JULY.,
2110,JULY.,21.
2111,JULY.,
2112,JULY.,All things are shadows of the shining true:
2113,JULY.,"Sun, sea, and air--close, potent, hurtless fire--"
2114,JULY.,"Flowers from their mother's prison--dove, and dew--"
2115,JULY.,Every thing holds a slender guiding clue
2116,JULY.,Back to the mighty oneness:--hearts of faith
2117,JULY.,"Know thee than light, than heat, endlessly nigher,"
2118,JULY.,"Our life's life, carpenter of Nazareth."
2119,JULY.,
2120,JULY.,22.
2121,JULY.,
2122,JULY.,"Sometimes, perhaps, the spiritual blood runs slow,"
2123,JULY.,"And soft along the veins of will doth flow,"
2124,JULY.,Seeking God's arteries from which it came.
2125,JULY.,"Or does the etherial, creative flame"
2126,JULY.,"Turn back upon itself, and latent grow?--"
2127,JULY.,"It matters not what figure or what name,"
2128,JULY.,"If thou art in me, and I am not to blame."
2129,JULY.,
2130,JULY.,23.
2131,JULY.,
2132,JULY.,"In such God-silence, the soul's nest, so long"
2133,JULY.,"As all is still, no flutter and no song,"
2134,JULY.,Is safe. But if my soul begin to act
2135,JULY.,Without some waking to the eternal fact
2136,JULY.,That my dear life is hid with Christ in God--
2137,JULY.,"I think and move a creature of earth's clod,"
2138,JULY.,"Stand on the finite, act upon the wrong."
2139,JULY.,
2140,JULY.,24.
2141,JULY.,
2142,JULY.,My soul this sermon hence for itself prepares:--
2143,JULY.,"""Then is there nothing vile thou mayst not do,"
2144,JULY.,"Buffeted in a tumult of low cares,"
2145,JULY.,"And treacheries of the old man 'gainst the new.""--"
2146,JULY.,"Lord, in my spirit let thy spirit move,"
2147,JULY.,"Warning, that it may not have to reprove:--"
2148,JULY.,"In my dead moments, master, stir the prayers."
2149,JULY.,
2150,JULY.,25.
2151,JULY.,
2152,JULY.,"Lord, let my soul o'erburdened then feel thee"
2153,JULY.,Thrilling through all its brain's stupidity.
2154,JULY.,"If I must slumber, heedless of ill harms,"
2155,JULY.,Let it not be but in my Father's arms;
2156,JULY.,"Outside the shelter of his garment's fold,"
2157,JULY.,"All is a waste, a terror-haunted wold.--"
2158,JULY.,"Lord, keep me. 'Tis thy child that cries. Behold."
2159,JULY.,
2160,JULY.,26.
2161,JULY.,
2162,JULY.,Some say that thou their endless love host won
2163,JULY.,By deeds for them which I may not believe
2164,JULY.,"Thou ever didst, or ever willedst done:"
2165,JULY.,"What matter, so they love thee? They receive"
2166,JULY.,Eternal more than the poor loom and wheel
2167,JULY.,Of their invention ever wove and spun.--
2168,JULY.,"I love thee for I must, thine all from head to heel."
2169,JULY.,
2170,JULY.,27.
2171,JULY.,
2172,JULY.,The love of thee will set all notions right.
2173,JULY.,Right save by love no thought can be or may;
2174,JULY.,Only love's knowledge is the primal light.
2175,JULY.,Questions keep camp along love's shining coast--
2176,JULY.,Challenge my love and would my entrance stay:
2177,JULY.,"Across the buzzing, doubting, challenging host,"
2178,JULY.,"I rush to thee, and cling, and cry--Thou know'st."
2179,JULY.,
2180,JULY.,28.
2181,JULY.,
2182,JULY.,"Oh, let me live in thy realities,"
2183,JULY.,"Nor substitute my notions for thy facts,"
2184,JULY.,Notion with notion making leagues and pacts;
2185,JULY.,"They are to truth but as dream-deeds to acts,"
2186,JULY.,"And questioned, make me doubt of everything.--"
2187,JULY.,"""O Lord, my God,"" my heart gets up and cries,"
2188,JULY.,"""Come thy own self, and with thee my faith bring."""
2189,JULY.,
2190,JULY.,29.
2191,JULY.,
2192,JULY.,"O master, my desires to work, to know,"
2193,JULY.,To be aware that I do live and grow--
2194,JULY.,"All restless wish for anything not thee,"
2195,JULY.,"I yield, and on thy altar offer me."
2196,JULY.,"Let me no more from out thy presence go,"
2197,JULY.,But keep me waiting watchful for thy will--
2198,JULY.,"Even while I do it, waiting watchful still."
2199,JULY.,
2200,JULY.,30.
2201,JULY.,
2202,JULY.,"Thou art the Lord of life, the secret thing."
2203,JULY.,"Thou wilt give endless more than I could find,"
2204,JULY.,Even if without thee I could go and seek;
2205,JULY.,"For thou art one, Christ, with my deepest mind,"
2206,JULY.,"Duty alive, self-willed, in me dost speak,"
2207,JULY.,And to a deeper purer being sting:
2208,JULY.,"I come to thee, my life, my causing kind."
2209,JULY.,
2210,JULY.,31.
2211,JULY.,
2212,JULY.,Nothing is alien in thy world immense--
2213,JULY.,No look of sky or earth or man or beast;
2214,JULY.,"""In the great hand of God I stand, and thence"""
2215,JULY.,"Look out on life, his endless, holy feast."
2216,JULY.,"To try to feel is but to court despair,"

2227,AUGUST.,
2228,AUGUST.,SO shall abundant entrance me be given
2229,AUGUST.,"Into the truth, my life's inheritance."
2230,AUGUST.,"Lo! as the sun shoots straight from out his tomb,"
2231,AUGUST.,"God-floated, casting round a lordly glance"
2232,AUGUST.,"Into the corners of his endless room,"
2233,AUGUST.,"So, through the rent which thou, O Christ, hast riven,"
2234,AUGUST.,I enter liberty's divine expanse.
2235,AUGUST.,
2236,AUGUST.,2.
2237,AUGUST.,
2238,AUGUST.,"It will be so--ah, so it is not now!"
2239,AUGUST.,"Who seeks thee for a little lazy peace,"
2240,AUGUST.,"Then, like a man all weary of the plough,"
2241,AUGUST.,"That leaves it standing in the furrow's crease,"
2242,AUGUST.,"Turns from thy presence for a foolish while,"
2243,AUGUST.,"Till comes again the rasp of unrest's file,"
2244,AUGUST.,From liberty is distant many a mile.
2245,AUGUST.,
2246,AUGUST.,3.
2247,AUGUST.,
2248,AUGUST.,"Like one that stops, and drinks, and turns, and goes"
2249,AUGUST.,"Into a land where never water flows,"
2250,AUGUST.,"There travels on, the dry and thirsty day,"
2251,AUGUST.,"Until the hot night veils the farther way,"
2252,AUGUST.,Then turns and finds again the bubbling pool--
2253,AUGUST.,"Here would I build my house, take up my stay,"
2254,AUGUST.,Nor ever leave my Sychar's margin cool.
2255,AUGUST.,
2256,AUGUST.,4.
2257,AUGUST.,
2258,AUGUST.,"Keep me, Lord, with thee. I call from out the dark--"
2259,AUGUST.,"Hear in thy light, of which I am a spark."
2260,AUGUST.,I know not what is mine and what is thine--
2261,AUGUST.,Of branch and stem I miss the differing mark--
2262,AUGUST.,"But if a mere hair's-breadth me separateth,"
2263,AUGUST.,"That hair's-breadth is eternal, infinite death."
2264,AUGUST.,"For sap thy dead branch calls, O living vine!"
2265,AUGUST.,
2266,AUGUST.,5.
2267,AUGUST.,
2268,AUGUST.,"I have no choice, I must do what I can;"
2269,AUGUST.,"But thou dost me, and all things else as well;"
2270,AUGUST.,Thou wilt take care thy child shall grow a man.
2271,AUGUST.,"Rouse thee, my faith; be king; with life be one;"
2272,AUGUST.,To trust in God is action's highest kind;
2273,AUGUST.,"Who trusts in God, his heart with life doth swell;"
2274,AUGUST.,Faith opens all the windows to God's wind.
2275,AUGUST.,
2276,AUGUST.,6.
2277,AUGUST.,
2278,AUGUST.,"O Father, thou art my eternity."
2279,AUGUST.,Not on the clasp Of consciousness--on thee
2280,AUGUST.,My life depends; and I can well afford
2281,AUGUST.,"All to forget, so thou remember, Lord."
2282,AUGUST.,In thee I rest; in sleep thou dost me fold;
2283,AUGUST.,"In thee I labour; still in thee, grow old;"
2284,AUGUST.,"And dying, shall I not in thee, my Life, be bold?"
2285,AUGUST.,
2286,AUGUST.,7.
2287,AUGUST.,
2288,AUGUST.,In holy things may be unholy greed.
2289,AUGUST.,"Thou giv'st a glimpse of many a lovely thing,"
2290,AUGUST.,"Not to be stored for use in any mind,"
2291,AUGUST.,But only for the present spiritual need.
2292,AUGUST.,"The holiest bread, if hoarded, soon will breed"
2293,AUGUST.,"The mammon-moth, the having-pride, I find."
2294,AUGUST.,'Tis momently thy heart gives out heart-quickening.
2295,AUGUST.,
2296,AUGUST.,8.
2297,AUGUST.,
2298,AUGUST.,"It is thyself, and neither this nor that,"
2299,AUGUST.,"Nor anything, told, taught, or dreamed of thee,"
2300,AUGUST.,That keeps us live. The holy maid who sat
2301,AUGUST.,"Low at thy feet, choosing the better part,"
2302,AUGUST.,"Rising, bore with her--what a memory!"
2303,AUGUST.,"Yet, brooding only on that treasure, she"

2305,AUGUST.,
2306,AUGUST.,9.
2307,AUGUST.,
2308,AUGUST.,"I am a fool when I would stop and think,"
2309,AUGUST.,"And lest I lose my thoughts, from duty shrink."
2310,AUGUST.,It is but avarice in another shape.
2311,AUGUST.,"'Tis as the vine-branch were to hoard the grape,"
2312,AUGUST.,Nor trust the living root beneath the sod.
2313,AUGUST.,"What trouble is that child to thee, my God,"
2314,AUGUST.,"Who sips thy gracious cup, and will not drink!"
2315,AUGUST.,
2316,AUGUST.,10.
2317,AUGUST.,
2318,AUGUST.,"True, faithful action only is the life,"
2319,AUGUST.,The grapes for which we feel the pruning knife.
2320,AUGUST.,Thoughts are but leaves; they fall and feed the ground.
2321,AUGUST.,"The holy seasons, swift and slow, go round;"
2322,AUGUST.,"The ministering leaves return, fresh, large, and rife--"
2323,AUGUST.,"But fresher, larger, more thoughts to the brain:--"
2324,AUGUST.,"Farewell, my dove!--come back, hope-laden, through the rain."
2325,AUGUST.,
2326,AUGUST.,11.
2327,AUGUST.,
2328,AUGUST.,"Well may this body poorer, feebler grow!"
2329,AUGUST.,It is undressing for its last sweet bed;
2330,AUGUST.,"But why should the soul, which death shall never know,"
2331,AUGUST.,"Authority, and power, and memory shed?"
2332,AUGUST.,It is that love with absolute faith would wed;
2333,AUGUST.,"God takes the inmost garments off his child,"

2335,AUGUST.,
2336,AUGUST.,12.

2340,AUGUST.,"I will not fool, degrade myself to trust"
2341,AUGUST.,"In less than that which maketh me say Me,"
2342,AUGUST.,In less than that causing itself to be.
2343,AUGUST.,"Then art within me, behind, beneath, above--"
2344,AUGUST.,I will be thine because I may and must.

2352,AUGUST.,Thou wilt care for it. Never shall I think
2353,AUGUST.,Of anything that thou mightst overlook:--
2354,AUGUST.,In faith-born triumph at thy feet I sink.
2355,AUGUST.,
2356,AUGUST.,14.
2357,AUGUST.,
2358,AUGUST.,"Thou carest more for that which I call mine,"
2359,AUGUST.,"In same sort--better manner than I could,"
2360,AUGUST.,"Even if I knew creation's ends divine,"
2361,AUGUST.,Rousing in me this vague desire of good.
2362,AUGUST.,Thou art more to me than my desires' whole brood;
2363,AUGUST.,"Thou art the only person, and I cry"
2364,AUGUST.,Unto the father I of this my I.
2365,AUGUST.,
2366,AUGUST.,15.
2367,AUGUST.,
2368,AUGUST.,"Thou who inspirest prayer, then bend'st thine ear;"
2369,AUGUST.,"It, crying with love's grand respect to hear!"
2370,AUGUST.,I cannot give myself to thee aright--
2371,AUGUST.,With the triumphant uttermost of gift;
2372,AUGUST.,That cannot be till I am full of light--
2373,AUGUST.,To perfect deed a perfect will must lift:--
2374,AUGUST.,"Inspire, possess, compel me, first of every might."
2375,AUGUST.,
2376,AUGUST.,16.
2377,AUGUST.,
2378,AUGUST.,I do not wonder men can ill believe
2379,AUGUST.,"Who make poor claims upon thee, perfect Lord;"
2380,AUGUST.,Then most I trust when most I would receive.
2381,AUGUST.,I wonder not that such do pray and grieve--
2382,AUGUST.,"The God they think, to be God is not fit."
2383,AUGUST.,"Then only in thy glory I seem to sit,"
2384,AUGUST.,When my heart claims from thine an infinite accord.
2385,AUGUST.,
2386,AUGUST.,17.
2387,AUGUST.,
2388,AUGUST.,More life I need ere I myself can be.
2389,AUGUST.,"Sometimes, when the eternal tide ebbs low,"
2390,AUGUST.,A moment weary of my life I grow--
2391,AUGUST.,"Weary of my existence' self, I mean,"
2392,AUGUST.,"Not of its plodding, not its wind and snow"
2393,AUGUST.,"Then to thy knee trusting I turn, and lean:"
2394,AUGUST.,"Thou will'st I live, and I do will with thee."
2395,AUGUST.,
2396,AUGUST.,18.
2397,AUGUST.,
2398,AUGUST.,"Dost thou mean sometimes that we should forget thee,"
2399,AUGUST.,Dropping the veil of things 'twixt thee and us?--
2400,AUGUST.,"Ah, not that we should lose thee and regret thee!"
2401,AUGUST.,"But that, we turning from our windows thus,"
2402,AUGUST.,"The frost-fixed God should vanish from the pane,"
2403,AUGUST.,"Sun-melted, and a moment, Father, let thee"
2404,AUGUST.,Look like thyself straight into heart and brain.
2405,AUGUST.,
2406,AUGUST.,19.
2407,AUGUST.,
2408,AUGUST.,"For sometimes when I am busy among men,"
2409,AUGUST.,With heart and brain an open thoroughfare
2410,AUGUST.,"For faces, words, and thoughts other than mine,"
2411,AUGUST.,"And a pause comes at length--oh, sudden then,"
2412,AUGUST.,Back throbs the tide with rush exultant rare;
2413,AUGUST.,And for a gentle moment I divine
2414,AUGUST.,Thy dawning presence flush my tremulous air.
2415,AUGUST.,
2416,AUGUST.,20.
2417,AUGUST.,
2418,AUGUST.,"If I have to forget thee, do thou see"
2419,AUGUST.,"It be a good, not bad forgetfulness;"
2420,AUGUST.,"That all its mellow, truthful air be free"
2421,AUGUST.,"From dusty noes, and soft with many a yes;"
2422,AUGUST.,"That as thy breath my life, my life may be"
2423,AUGUST.,"Man's breath. So when thou com'st at hour unknown,"
2424,AUGUST.,Thou shalt find nothing in me but thine own.
2425,AUGUST.,
2426,AUGUST.,21.
2427,AUGUST.,
2428,AUGUST.,"Thou being in me, in my deepest me,"
2429,AUGUST.,"Through all the time I do not think of thee,"
2430,AUGUST.,Shall I not grow at last so true within
2431,AUGUST.,As to forget thee and yet never sin?
2432,AUGUST.,"Shall I not walk the loud world's busy way,"
2433,AUGUST.,Yet in thy palace-porch sit all the day?
2434,AUGUST.,"Not conscious think of thee, yet never from thee stray?"
2435,AUGUST.,
2436,AUGUST.,22.
2437,AUGUST.,
2438,AUGUST.,"Forget!--Oh, must it be?--Would it were rather"
2439,AUGUST.,That every sense was so filled with my father
2440,AUGUST.,"That not in anything could I forget him,"
2441,AUGUST.,"But deepest, highest must in all things set him!--"
2442,AUGUST.,"Yet if thou think in me, God, what great matter"
2443,AUGUST.,Though my poor thought to former break and latter--
2444,AUGUST.,"As now my best thoughts; break, before thee foiled, and scatter!"
2445,AUGUST.,
2446,AUGUST.,23.
2447,AUGUST.,
2448,AUGUST.,"Some way there must be of my not forgetting,"
2449,AUGUST.,"And thither thou art leading me, my God."
2450,AUGUST.,"The child that, weary of his mother's petting,"
2451,AUGUST.,"Runs out the moment that his feet are shod,"
2452,AUGUST.,"May see her face in every flower he sees,"
2453,AUGUST.,"And she, although beyond the window sitting,"
2454,AUGUST.,Be nearer him than when he sat upon her knees.
2455,AUGUST.,
2456,AUGUST.,24.
2457,AUGUST.,
2458,AUGUST.,"What if, when I at last, at the long last,"
2459,AUGUST.,"Shall see thy face, my Lord, my life's delight,"
2460,AUGUST.,It should not be the face that hath been glassed
2461,AUGUST.,In poor imagination's mirror slight!
2462,AUGUST.,"Will my soul sink, and shall I stand aghast,"
2463,AUGUST.,"Beggared of hope, my heart a conscious blight,"
2464,AUGUST.,Amazed and lost--death's bitterness come and not passed?
2465,AUGUST.,
2466,AUGUST.,25.
2467,AUGUST.,
2468,AUGUST.,"Ah, no! for from thy heart the love will press,"
2469,AUGUST.,"And shining from thy perfect human face,"
2470,AUGUST.,Will sink into me like the father's kiss;
2471,AUGUST.,And deepening wide the gulf of consciousness
2472,AUGUST.,"Beyond imagination's lowest abyss,"
2473,AUGUST.,"Will, with the potency of creative grace,"
2474,AUGUST.,Lord it throughout the larger thinking place.
2475,AUGUST.,
2476,AUGUST.,26.
2477,AUGUST.,
2478,AUGUST.,"Thus God-possessed, new born, ah, not for long"
2479,AUGUST.,"Should I the sight behold, beatified,"
2480,AUGUST.,"Know it creating in me, feel the throng"
2481,AUGUST.,"Of speechless hopes out-throbbing like a tide,"
2482,AUGUST.,"And my heart rushing, borne aloft the flood,"
2483,AUGUST.,To offer at his feet its living blood--
2484,AUGUST.,"Ere, glory-hid, the other face I spied."
2485,AUGUST.,
2486,AUGUST.,27.
2487,AUGUST.,
2488,AUGUST.,"For out imagination is, in small,"
2489,AUGUST.,"And with the making-difference that must be,"
2490,AUGUST.,Mirror of God's creating mirror; all
2491,AUGUST.,"That shows itself therein, that formeth he,"
2492,AUGUST.,"And there is Christ, no bodiless vanity,"
2493,AUGUST.,"Though, face to face, the mighty perfectness"
2494,AUGUST.,With glory blurs the dim-reflected less.
2495,AUGUST.,
2496,AUGUST.,28.
2497,AUGUST.,
2498,AUGUST.,"I clasp thy feet, O father of the living!"
2499,AUGUST.,"Thou wilt not let my fluttering hopes be more,"
2500,AUGUST.,"Or lovelier, or greater, than thy giving!"
2501,AUGUST.,"Surely thy ships will bring to my poor shore,"
2502,AUGUST.,Of gold and peacocks such a shining store
2503,AUGUST.,"As will laugh all the dreams to holy scorn,"
2504,AUGUST.,Of love and sorrow that were ever born.
2505,AUGUST.,
2506,AUGUST.,29.
2507,AUGUST.,
2508,AUGUST.,"Sometimes it seems pure natural to trust,"
2509,AUGUST.,"And trust right largely, grandly, infinitely,"
2510,AUGUST.,Daring the splendour of the giver's part;
2511,AUGUST.,"At other times, the whole earth is but dust,"
2512,AUGUST.,"The sky is dust, yea, dust the human heart;"
2513,AUGUST.,"Then art thou nowhere, there is no room for thee"
2514,AUGUST.,In the great dust-heap of eternity.
2515,AUGUST.,
2516,AUGUST.,30.
2517,AUGUST.,
2518,AUGUST.,But why should it be possible to mistrust--
2519,AUGUST.,"Nor possible only, but its opposite hard?"
2520,AUGUST.,Why should not man believe because he must--
2521,AUGUST.,By sight's compulsion? Why should he be scarred
2522,AUGUST.,With conflict? worn with doubting fine and long?--
2523,AUGUST.,No man is fit for heaven's musician throng
2524,AUGUST.,Who has not tuned an instrument all shook and jarred.
2525,AUGUST.,
2526,AUGUST.,31.
2527,AUGUST.,
2528,AUGUST.,"Therefore, O Lord, when all things common seem,"
2529,AUGUST.,"When all is dust, and self the centre clod,"
2530,AUGUST.,"When grandeur is a hopeless, foolish dream,"
2531,AUGUST.,"And anxious care more reasonable than God,--"
2532,AUGUST.,Out of the ashes I will call to thee--
2533,AUGUST.,In spite of dead distrust call earnestly:--

2547,SEPTEMBER.,"Nought is to seek but praise, to shun but chance;"
2548,SEPTEMBER.,"A moment more, and God is all in all,"
2549,SEPTEMBER.,And not a sparrow from its nest can fall

2551,SEPTEMBER.,

2553,SEPTEMBER.,
2554,SEPTEMBER.,I know at least which is the better mood.
2555,SEPTEMBER.,"When on a heap of cares I sit and brood,"

2557,SEPTEMBER.,I feel a lower thing than when I stood
2558,SEPTEMBER.,"The world's true heir, fearless as, on its stalk,"
2559,SEPTEMBER.,A lily meeting Jesus in his walk:
2560,SEPTEMBER.,I am not all mood--I can judge betwixt.
2561,SEPTEMBER.,
2562,SEPTEMBER.,3.
2563,SEPTEMBER.,
2564,SEPTEMBER.,Such differing moods can scarce to one belong;
2565,SEPTEMBER.,Shall the same fountain sweet and bitter yield?
2566,SEPTEMBER.,"Shall what bore late the dust-mood, think and brood"
2567,SEPTEMBER.,Till it bring forth the great believing mood?
2568,SEPTEMBER.,"Or that which bore the grand mood, bald and peeled,"
2569,SEPTEMBER.,"Sit down to croon the shabby sensual song,"
2570,SEPTEMBER.,"To hug itself, and sink from wrong to meaner wrong?"
2571,SEPTEMBER.,

2631,SEPTEMBER.,
2632,SEPTEMBER.,10.
2633,SEPTEMBER.,
2634,SEPTEMBER.,Ever seem to fail in utterance.
2635,SEPTEMBER.,Sometimes amid the swift melodious dance
2636,SEPTEMBER.,"Of fluttering words--as if it had not been,"
2637,SEPTEMBER.,"The thought has melted, vanished into night;"
2638,SEPTEMBER.,"Sometimes I say a thing I did not mean,"

2658,SEPTEMBER.,The heaven is black with clouds and coming rain;
2659,SEPTEMBER.,"High soaring faith is grown a heavy task,"

2723,SEPTEMBER.,
2724,SEPTEMBER.,Yet more and more of me thou dost demand;

2757,SEPTEMBER.,Wipes off the bloom; and on the harp of faith
2758,SEPTEMBER.,Its fretted strings doth slacken still and shift:

3289,NOVEMBER,"Make me clean, brother, with thy burning shine;"
3290,NOVEMBER,"From thy rich treasures, householder divine,"
3291,NOVEMBER,"Bring forth fair garments, old and new, I pray,"

3296,NOVEMBER,"My prayer-bird was cold--would not away,"
3297,NOVEMBER,Although I set it on the edge of the nest.
3298,NOVEMBER,Then I bethought me of the story old--
3299,NOVEMBER,"Love-fact or loving fable, thou know'st best--"
3300,NOVEMBER,"How, when the children had made sparrows of clay,"
3301,NOVEMBER,"Thou mad'st them birds, with wings to flutter and fold:"
3302,NOVEMBER,"Take, Lord, my prayer in thy hand, and make it pray."
3303,NOVEMBER,
3304,NOVEMBER,15.
3305,NOVEMBER,
3306,NOVEMBER,"My poor clay-sparrow seems turned to a stone,"

3313,NOVEMBER,
3314,NOVEMBER,16.
3315,NOVEMBER,
3316,NOVEMBER,Oh what it were to be right sure of thee!
3317,NOVEMBER,"Sure that thou art, and the same as thy son, Jesus!"
3318,NOVEMBER,"Oh, faith is deeper, wider than the sea,"
3319,NOVEMBER,"Yea, than the blue of heaven that ever flees us!"
3320,NOVEMBER,"Yet simple as the cry of sore-hurt child,"
3321,NOVEMBER,"Or as his shout, with sudden gladness wild,"
3322,NOVEMBER,"When home from school he runs, till morn set free."
3323,NOVEMBER,
3324,NOVEMBER,17.
3325,NOVEMBER,
3326,NOVEMBER,"If I were sure thou, Father, verily art,"

3330,NOVEMBER,"Sure as I am that I do eat and drink,"
3331,NOVEMBER,"And have a heart to love and laugh and think,"
3332,NOVEMBER,Meseems in flame the joy might from my body start.
3333,NOVEMBER,
3334,NOVEMBER,18.
3335,NOVEMBER,
3336,NOVEMBER,But I must know thee in a deeper way
3337,NOVEMBER,"Than any of these ways, or know thee not;"
3338,NOVEMBER,My heart at peace far loftier proof must lay
3339,NOVEMBER,"Than if the wind thou me the wave didst roll,"
3340,NOVEMBER,"Than if I lay before thee a sunny spot,"
3341,NOVEMBER,"Or knew thee as the body knows its soul,"
3342,NOVEMBER,Or even as the part doth know its perfect whole.
3343,NOVEMBER,
3344,NOVEMBER,19.
3345,NOVEMBER,
3346,NOVEMBER,There is no word to tell how I must know thee;
3347,NOVEMBER,No wind clasped ever a low meadow-flower
3348,NOVEMBER,So close that as to nearness it could show thee;
3349,NOVEMBER,No rainbow so makes one the sun and shower.
3350,NOVEMBER,"A something with thee, I am a nothing fro' thee."
3351,NOVEMBER,"Because I am not save as I am in thee,"

3353,NOVEMBER,
3354,NOVEMBER,20.
3355,NOVEMBER,
3356,NOVEMBER,I know not how--for that I first must know thee.
3357,NOVEMBER,"I know I know thee not as I would know thee,"

3359,NOVEMBER,"Till he broke bread, and therein they must know him."
3360,NOVEMBER,"I know thee, knowing that I do not know thee,"
3361,NOVEMBER,Nor ever shall till one with me I know thee--

3365,NOVEMBER,
3366,NOVEMBER,"Creation under me, in, and above,"
3367,NOVEMBER,"Slopes upward from the base, a pyramid,"
3368,NOVEMBER,"On whose point I shall stand at last, and love."
3369,NOVEMBER,"From the first rush of vapour at thy will,"
3370,NOVEMBER,"To the last poet-word that darkness chid,"
3371,NOVEMBER,"Thou hast been sending up creation's hill,"
3372,NOVEMBER,To lift thy souls aloft in faithful Godhead free.

3378,NOVEMBER,"I pray thee, let me live--alive and free."
3379,NOVEMBER,"My soul will break forth in melodious thanks,"
3380,NOVEMBER,"Aware at last what thou wouldst have it be,"
3381,NOVEMBER,"When thy life shall be light in me, and when"
3382,NOVEMBER,My life to thine is answer and amen.
3383,NOVEMBER,
3384,NOVEMBER,23.
3385,NOVEMBER,
3386,NOVEMBER,How oft I say the same things in these lines!
3387,NOVEMBER,"Even as a man, buried in during dark,"
3388,NOVEMBER,"Turns ever where the edge of twilight shines,"
3389,NOVEMBER,Prays ever towards the vague eternal mark;
3390,NOVEMBER,"Or as the sleeper, having dreamed he drinks,"
3391,NOVEMBER,"Back straightway into thirstful dreaming sinks,"
3392,NOVEMBER,"So turns my will to thee, for thee still longs, still pines."

3398,NOVEMBER,To-morrow on to-day the man heaps doubled;
3399,NOVEMBER,"The child laughs, hopeful, even in his sleep."
3400,NOVEMBER,The man rebukes the child for foolish trust;

3405,NOVEMBER,
3406,NOVEMBER,"Till I am one, with oneness manifold,"
3407,NOVEMBER,"I must breed contradiction, strife, and doubt;"
3408,NOVEMBER,Things tread Thy court--look real--take proving hold--
3409,NOVEMBER,My Christ is not yet grown to cast them out;
3410,NOVEMBER,"Alas! to me, false-judging 'twixt the twain,"
3411,NOVEMBER,"The Unseen oft fancy seems, while, all about,"
3412,NOVEMBER,The Seen doth lord it with a mighty train.
3413,NOVEMBER,
3414,NOVEMBER,26.
3415,NOVEMBER,
3416,NOVEMBER,"But when the Will hath learned obedience royal,"
3417,NOVEMBER,He straight will set the child upon the throne;
3418,NOVEMBER,"To whom the seen things all, grown instant loyal,"
3419,NOVEMBER,"Will gather to his feet, in homage prone--"
3420,NOVEMBER,The child their master they have ever known;

3428,NOVEMBER,"And clothed and loved her, many a growing year;"
3429,NOVEMBER,"Lo! now a friend of months draws gently near,"
3430,NOVEMBER,And claims her future--all beyond his ken--
3431,NOVEMBER,There he hath never loved her nor hath led:
3432,NOVEMBER,"She weeps and moans, but turns, and leaves her home so dear."
3433,NOVEMBER,
3434,NOVEMBER,28.
3435,NOVEMBER,
3436,NOVEMBER,"She leaves, but not forsakes. Oft in the night,"
3437,NOVEMBER,"Oft at mid-day when all is still around,"
3438,NOVEMBER,"Sudden will rise, in dim pathetic light,"
3439,NOVEMBER,"Some childish memory of household bliss,"
3440,NOVEMBER,Or sorrow by love's service robed and crowned;
3441,NOVEMBER,"Rich in his love, she yet will sometimes miss"
3442,NOVEMBER,"The mother's folding arms, the mother's sealing kiss."

3449,NOVEMBER,"Yea, when at last the janitor draws near,"
3450,NOVEMBER,"A still, pale joy will through the darkness go,"
3451,NOVEMBER,"At thought of lying in those arms again,"
3452,NOVEMBER,Which once were heaven enough for any pain.
3453,NOVEMBER,
3454,NOVEMBER,30.
3455,NOVEMBER,
3456,NOVEMBER,By love doth love grow mighty in its love:
3457,NOVEMBER,"Once thou shalt love us, child, as we love thee."
3458,NOVEMBER,"Father of loves, is it not thy decree"
3459,NOVEMBER,"That, by our long, far-wandering remove"
3460,NOVEMBER,"From thee, our life, our home, our being blest,"
