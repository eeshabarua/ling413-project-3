204,INTRODUCTION,
205,INTRODUCTION,"In one of Rossetti's invaluable notes on poetry, he tells us that to him"
206,INTRODUCTION,"""the leading point about Coleridge's work is its human love."" We may"
207,INTRODUCTION,remember Coleridge's own words:
208,INTRODUCTION,
209,INTRODUCTION,
210,INTRODUCTION,"""To be beloved is all I need,"
211,INTRODUCTION,"And whom I love, I love indeed."""
212,INTRODUCTION,
213,INTRODUCTION,
214,INTRODUCTION,"Yet love, though it is the word which he uses of himself, is not really"
215,INTRODUCTION,"what he himself meant when using it, but rather an affectionate sympathy,"
216,INTRODUCTION,in which there seems to have been little element of passion. Writing to his
217,INTRODUCTION,"wife, during that first absence in Germany, whose solitude tried him so"
218,INTRODUCTION,"much, he laments that there is ""no one to love."" ""Love is the vital air of"
219,INTRODUCTION,"my genius,"" he tells her, and adds: ""I am deeply convinced that if I were"
220,INTRODUCTION,"to remain a few years among objects for whom I had no affection, I should"
221,INTRODUCTION,"wholly lose the powers of intellect."""
222,INTRODUCTION,
223,INTRODUCTION,"With this incessant, passionless sensibility, it was not unnatural that his"
224,INTRODUCTION,thirst for friendship was stronger than his need of love; that to him
225,INTRODUCTION,friendship was hardly distinguishable from love. Throughout all his letters
226,INTRODUCTION,"there is a series of causeless explosions of emotion, which it is hardly"
227,INTRODUCTION,"possible to take seriously, but which, far from being insincere, is really,"
228,INTRODUCTION,"no doubt, the dribbling overflow of choked-up feelings, a sort of moral"
229,INTRODUCTION,"leakage. It might be said of Coleridge, in the phrase which he used of"
230,INTRODUCTION,"Nelson, that he was ""heart-starved."" Tied for life to a woman with whom he"
231,INTRODUCTION,"had not one essential sympathy, the whole of his nature was put out of"
232,INTRODUCTION,"focus; and perhaps nothing but ""the joy of grief,"" and the terrible and"
233,INTRODUCTION,"fettering power of luxuriating over his own sorrows, and tracing them to"
234,INTRODUCTION,"first principles, outside himself or in the depths of his sub-"
235,INTRODUCTION,"consciousness, gave him the courage to support that long, everpresent"
236,INTRODUCTION,divorce.
237,INTRODUCTION,
238,INTRODUCTION,"Both for his good and evil, he had never been able to endure emotion"
239,INTRODUCTION,"without either diluting or intensifying it with thought, and with always"
240,INTRODUCTION,self-conscious thought. He uses identically the same words in writing his
241,INTRODUCTION,"last, deeply moved letter to Mary Evans, and in relating the matter to"
242,INTRODUCTION,Southey. He cannot get away from words; coming as near to sincerity as he
243,INTRODUCTION,"can, words are always between him and his emotion. Hence his over-emphasis,"
244,INTRODUCTION,"his rhetoric of humility. In 1794 he writes to his brother George: ""Mine"
245,INTRODUCTION,"eyes gush out with tears, my heart is sick and languid with the weight of"
246,INTRODUCTION,"unmerited kindness."" Nine days later he writes to his brother James: ""My"
247,INTRODUCTION,"conduct towards you, and towards my other brothers, has displayed a strange"
248,INTRODUCTION,"combination of madness, ingratitude, and dishonesty. But you forgive me."
249,INTRODUCTION,May my Maker forgive me! May the time arrive when I shall have forgiven
250,INTRODUCTION,"myself!"" Here we see both what he calls his ""gangrened sensibility"" and a"
251,INTRODUCTION,complete abandonment to the feelings of the moment. It is always a self-
252,INTRODUCTION,"conscious abandonment, during which he watches himself with approval, and"
253,INTRODUCTION,"seems to be saying: ""Now that is truly 'feeling'!"" He can never concentrate"
254,INTRODUCTION,himself on any emotion; he swims about in floods of his own tears. With so
255,INTRODUCTION,"little sense of reality in anything, he has no sense of the reality of"
256,INTRODUCTION,"direct emotion, but is preoccupied, from the moment of the first shock, in"
257,INTRODUCTION,"exploring it for its universal principle, and then nourishes it almost in"
258,INTRODUCTION,triumph at what he has discovered. This is not insincerity; it is the
259,INTRODUCTION,"metaphysical, analytical, and parenthetic mind in action. ""I have"
260,INTRODUCTION,"endeavoured to feel what I ought to feel,"" he once significantly writes."
261,INTRODUCTION,
262,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge had many friends, to some of whom, as to Lamb, his friendship was"
263,INTRODUCTION,the most priceless thing in life; but the friendship which meant most to
264,INTRODUCTION,"him, not only as a man, but as a poet, was the friendship with Wordsworth"
265,INTRODUCTION,"and with Dorothy Wordsworth. ""There is a sense of the word Love,"" he wrote"
266,INTRODUCTION,"to Wordsworth in 1812, ""in which I never felt it but to you and one of your"
267,INTRODUCTION,"household."" After his quarrel in that year he has ""an agony of weeping."""
268,INTRODUCTION,"""After fifteen years of such religious, almost superstitious idolatry and"
269,INTRODUCTION,"self-sacrifice!"" he laments. Now it was during his first, daily"
270,INTRODUCTION,companionship with the Wordsworths that he wrote almost all his greatest
271,INTRODUCTION,"work. ""The Ancient Mariner"" and ""Christabel"" were both written in a kind of"
272,INTRODUCTION,"rivalry with Wordsworth; and the ""Ode on Dejection"" was written after four"
273,INTRODUCTION,"months' absence from him, in the first glow and encouragement of a return"
274,INTRODUCTION,to that one inspiring comradeship. Wordsworth was the only poet among his
275,INTRODUCTION,"friends whom he wholly admired, and Wordsworth was more exclusively a poet,"
276,INTRODUCTION,"more wholly absorbed in thinking poetry and thinking about poetry, and in a"
277,INTRODUCTION,"thoroughly practical way, than almost any poet who has ever lived. It was"
278,INTRODUCTION,not only for his solace in life that Coleridge required sympathy; he needed
279,INTRODUCTION,"the galvanizing of continual intercourse with a poet, and with one to whom"
280,INTRODUCTION,"poetry was the only thing of importance. Coleridge, when he was by himself,"
281,INTRODUCTION,"was never sure of this; there was his _magnum opus_, the revelation of"
282,INTRODUCTION,all philosophy; and he sometimes has doubts of the worth of his own poetry.
283,INTRODUCTION,Had Coleridge been able to live uninterruptedly in the company of the
284,INTRODUCTION,"Wordsworths, even with the unsympathetic wife at home, the opium in the"
285,INTRODUCTION,"cupboard, and the _magnum opus_ on the desk, I am convinced that we"
286,INTRODUCTION,should have had for our reading to-day all those poems which went down with
287,INTRODUCTION,him into silence.
288,INTRODUCTION,
289,INTRODUCTION,"What Coleridge lacked was what theologians call a ""saving belief"" in"
290,INTRODUCTION,"Christianity, or else a strenuous intellectual immorality. He imagined"
291,INTRODUCTION,"himself to believe in Christianity, but his belief never realized itself in"
292,INTRODUCTION,"effective action, either in the mind or in conduct, while it frequently"
293,INTRODUCTION,clogged his energies by weak scruples and restrictions which were but so
294,INTRODUCTION,many internal irritations. He calls upon the religion which he has never
295,INTRODUCTION,firmly apprehended to support him under some misfortune of his own making;
296,INTRODUCTION,"it does not support him, but he finds excuses for his weakness in what seem"
297,INTRODUCTION,to him its promises of help. Coleridge was not strong enough to be a
298,INTRODUCTION,"Christian, and he was not strong enough to rely on the impulses of his own"
299,INTRODUCTION,"nature, and to turn his failings into a very actual kind of success. When"
300,INTRODUCTION,"Blake said, ""If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise,"""
301,INTRODUCTION,he expressed a profound truth which Nietzsche and others have done little
302,INTRODUCTION,more than amplify. There is nothing so hopeless as inert or inactive
303,INTRODUCTION,"virtue: it is a form of life grown putrid, and it turns into poisonous,"
304,INTRODUCTION,decaying matter in the soul. If Coleridge had been more callous towards
305,INTRODUCTION,"what he felt to be his duties, if he had not merely neglected them, as he"
306,INTRODUCTION,"did, but justified himself for neglecting them, on any ground of"
307,INTRODUCTION,"intellectual or physical necessity, or if he had merely let them slide"
308,INTRODUCTION,"without thought or regret, he would have been more complete, more"
309,INTRODUCTION,"effectual, as a man, and he might have achieved more finished work as an"
310,INTRODUCTION,artist.
311,INTRODUCTION,
312,INTRODUCTION,"To Coleridge there was as much difficulty in belief as in action, for"
313,INTRODUCTION,belief is itself an action of the mind. He was always anxious to believe
314,INTRODUCTION,"anything that would carry him beyond the limits of time and space, but it"
315,INTRODUCTION,was not often that he could give more than a speculative assent to even the
316,INTRODUCTION,"most improbable of creeds. Always seeking fixity, his mind was too fluid"
317,INTRODUCTION,"for any anchor to hold in it. He drifted from speculation to speculation,"
318,INTRODUCTION,"often seeming to forget his aim by the way, in almost the collector's"
319,INTRODUCTION,delight over the curiosities he had found in passing. On one page of his
320,INTRODUCTION,letters he writes earnestly to the atheist Thelwall in defence of
321,INTRODUCTION,"Christianity; on another page we find him saying, ""My Spinosism (if"
322,INTRODUCTION,"Spinosism it be, and i' faith 'tis very like it)""; and then comes the"
323,INTRODUCTION,"solemn assurance: ""I am a Berkleyan."" Southey, in his rough,"
324,INTRODUCTION,"uncomprehending way, writes: ""Hartley was ousted by Berkeley, Berkeley by"
325,INTRODUCTION,"Spinoza, and Spinoza by Plato; when last I saw him Jacob Behmen had some"
326,INTRODUCTION,"chance of coming in. The truth is that he plays with systems""; so it seemed"
327,INTRODUCTION,"to Southey, who could see no better. To Coleridge all systems were of"
328,INTRODUCTION,"importance, because in every system there was its own measure of truth. He"
329,INTRODUCTION,"was always setting his mind to think about itself, and felt that he worked"
330,INTRODUCTION,both hard and well if he had gained a clearer glimpse into that dark
331,INTRODUCTION,"cavern. ""Yet I have not been altogether idle,"" he writes in December, 180O,"
332,INTRODUCTION,"""having in my own conceit gained great light into several parts of the"
333,INTRODUCTION,human mind which have hitherto remained either wholly unexplained or most
334,INTRODUCTION,"falsely explained."" In March, 1801, he declares that he has ""completely"
335,INTRODUCTION,"extricated the notions of time and space."" ""This,"" he says, ""I have"
336,INTRODUCTION,"_done_; but I trust that I am about to do more--namely, that I shall"
337,INTRODUCTION,"be able to evolve all the five senses, and to state their growth and the"
338,INTRODUCTION,"causes of their difference, and in this evolvement to solve the process of"
339,INTRODUCTION,"life and consciousness."" He hopes that before his thirtieth year he will"
340,INTRODUCTION,"""thoroughly understand the whole of Nature's works."" ""My opinion is this,"""
341,INTRODUCTION,"he says, defining one part at least of his way of approach to truth, ""that"
342,INTRODUCTION,"deep thinking is attainable only by a man of deep feeling, and that all"
343,INTRODUCTION,"truth is a species of revelation."" On the other hand, he assures us,"
344,INTRODUCTION,speaking of that _magnum opus_ which weighed upon him and supported
345,INTRODUCTION,"him to the end of his life, ""the very object throughout from the first page"
346,INTRODUCTION,to the last [is] to reconcile the dictates of common sense with the
347,INTRODUCTION,"conclusions of scientific reasoning."""
348,INTRODUCTION,
349,INTRODUCTION,"This _magnum opus_, ""a work which should contain all knowledge and"
350,INTRODUCTION,"proclaim all philosophy, had,"" says Mr. Ernest Coleridge, ""been Coleridge's"
351,INTRODUCTION,"dream from the beginning."" Only a few months before his death, we find him"
352,INTRODUCTION,"writing to John Sterling: ""Many a fond dream have I amused myself with, of"
353,INTRODUCTION,"your residing near me, or in the same house, and of preparing, with your"
354,INTRODUCTION,"and Mr. Green's assistance, my whole system for the press, as far as it"
355,INTRODUCTION,"exists in any _systematic_ form; that is, beginning with the"
356,INTRODUCTION,"Propyleum, On the Power and Use of Words, comprising Logic, as the Canons"
357,INTRODUCTION,"of _Conclusion_, as the criterion of _Premises_, and lastly as"
358,INTRODUCTION,"the discipline and evolution of Ideas (and then the Methodus et Epochee, or"
359,INTRODUCTION,"the Disquisition on God, Nature, and Man), the two first grand divisions of"
360,INTRODUCTION,"which, from the Ens super Ens to the _Fall_, or from God"
361,INTRODUCTION,"to Hades, and then from Chaos to the commencement of living organization,"
362,INTRODUCTION,"containing the whole of the Dynamic Philosophy, and the deduction of the"
363,INTRODUCTION,"Powers and Forces, are complete."" Twenty years earlier, he had written to"
364,INTRODUCTION,"Daniel Stuart that he was keeping his morning hours sacred to his ""most"
365,INTRODUCTION,"important Work, which is printing at Bristol,"" as he imagined. It was then"
366,INTRODUCTION,"to be called ""Christianity, the one true Philosophy, or Five Treatises on"
367,INTRODUCTION,"the Logos, or Communicative Intelligence, natural, human, and divine."" Of"
368,INTRODUCTION,"this vast work only fragments remain, mostly unpublished: two large quarto"
369,INTRODUCTION,"volumes on logic, a volume intended as an introduction, a commentary on the"
370,INTRODUCTION,"Gospels and some of the Epistles, together with ""innumerable fragments of"
371,INTRODUCTION,"metaphysical and theological speculation."" But out of those fragments no"
372,INTRODUCTION,"system was ever to be constructed, though a fervent disciple, J. H. Green,"
373,INTRODUCTION,"devoted twenty-eight years to the attempt. ""Christabel"" unfinished, the"
374,INTRODUCTION,_magnum opus_ unachieved: both were but parallel symptoms of a mind
375,INTRODUCTION,"""thought-bewildered"" to the end, and bewildered by excess of light and by"
376,INTRODUCTION,"crowding energies always in conflict, always in escape."
377,INTRODUCTION,
378,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge's search, throughout his life, was after the absolute, an"
379,INTRODUCTION,"absolute not only in thought but in all human relations, in love,"
380,INTRODUCTION,"friendship, faith in man, faith in God, faith in beauty; and while it was"
381,INTRODUCTION,"this profound dissatisfaction with less than the perfect form of every art,"
382,INTRODUCTION,"passion, thought, or circumstance, that set him adrift in life, making him"
383,INTRODUCTION,"seem untrue to duty, conviction, and himself, it was this also that formed"
384,INTRODUCTION,"in him the double existence of the poet and the philosopher, each"
385,INTRODUCTION,supplementing and interpenetrating the other. The poet and the philosopher
386,INTRODUCTION,"are but two aspects of one reality; or rather, the poetic and the"
387,INTRODUCTION,philosophic attitudes are but two ways of seeing. The poet who is not also
388,INTRODUCTION,a philosopher is like a flower without a root. Both seek the same
389,INTRODUCTION,"infinitude; one apprehending the idea, the other the image. One seeks truth"
390,INTRODUCTION,"for its beauty; the other finds beauty, an abstract, intellectual beauty,"
391,INTRODUCTION,in the innermost home of truth. Poetry and metaphysics are alike a
392,INTRODUCTION,"disengaging, for different ends, of the absolute element in things."
393,INTRODUCTION,
394,INTRODUCTION,"In Coleridge, metaphysics joined with an unbounded imagination, in equal"
395,INTRODUCTION,"flight from reality, from the notions of time and space. Each was an equal"
396,INTRODUCTION,"denial of the reality of what we call real things; the one experimental,"
397,INTRODUCTION,"searching, reasoning; the other a ""shaping spirit of imagination,"" an"
398,INTRODUCTION,embodying force. His sight was always straining into the darkness; and he
399,INTRODUCTION,"has himself noted that from earliest childhood his ""mind was habituated to"
400,INTRODUCTION,"the Vast."" ""I never regarded my senses,"" he says, ""as the criteria of my"
401,INTRODUCTION,"belief""; and ""those who have been led to the same truths step by step,"
402,INTRODUCTION,"through the constant testimony of their senses, seem to want a sense which"
403,INTRODUCTION,"I possess."" To Coleridge only mind existed, an eternal and an eternally"
404,INTRODUCTION,active thought; and it was as a corollary to his philosophical conception
405,INTRODUCTION,of the universe that he set his mind to a conscious rebuilding of the world
406,INTRODUCTION,"in space. His magic, that which makes his poetry, was but the final release"
407,INTRODUCTION,in art of a winged thought fluttering helplessly among speculations and
408,INTRODUCTION,theories; it was the song of release.
409,INTRODUCTION,
410,INTRODUCTION,"De Quincey has said of Coleridge: ""I believe it to be notorious that he"
411,INTRODUCTION,"first began the use of opium, not as a relief from any bodily pains or"
412,INTRODUCTION,nervous irritations--for his constitution was strong and excellent--but as
413,INTRODUCTION,"a source of luxurious sensations."" Hartley Coleridge, in the biographical"
414,INTRODUCTION,"supplement to the ""Biographia Literaria,"" replies with what we now know to"
415,INTRODUCTION,"be truth: ""If my Father sought more from opium than the mere absence of"
416,INTRODUCTION,"pain, I feel assured that it was not luxurious sensations or the glowing"
417,INTRODUCTION,phantasmagoria of passive dreams; but that the power of the medicine might
418,INTRODUCTION,"keep down the agitations of his nervous system, like a strong hand grasping"
419,INTRODUCTION,"the strings of some shattered lyre."" In 1795. that is, at the age of"
420,INTRODUCTION,"twenty-three, we find him taking laudanum; in 1796, he is taking it in"
421,INTRODUCTION,"large doses; by the late spring of 1801 he is under the ""fearful slavery,"""
422,INTRODUCTION,"as he was to call it, of opium. ""My sole sensuality,"" he says of this time,"
423,INTRODUCTION,"""was not to be in pain."" In a terrible letter addressed to Joseph Cottle in"
424,INTRODUCTION,"1814 he declares that he was ""seduced to the _accursed_ habit"
425,INTRODUCTION,"ignorantly""; and he describes ""the direful moment, when my pulse began to"
426,INTRODUCTION,"fluctuate, my heart to palpitate, and such a dreadful falling abroad, as it"
427,INTRODUCTION,"were, of my whole frame, such intolerable restlessness, and incipient"
428,INTRODUCTION,"bewilderment ... for my case is a species of madness, only that it is a"
429,INTRODUCTION,"derangement, an utter impotence of the volition, and not of the"
430,INTRODUCTION,"intellectual faculties."" And, throughout, it is always the pains, never the"
431,INTRODUCTION,"pleasures, of opium that he registers."
432,INTRODUCTION,
433,INTRODUCTION,"Opium took hold of him by what was inert in his animal nature, and not by"
434,INTRODUCTION,"any active sensuality. His imagination required no wings, but rather"
435,INTRODUCTION,fetters; and it is evident that opium was more often a sedative than a spur
436,INTRODUCTION,to his senses.
437,INTRODUCTION,
438,INTRODUCTION,The effect of opium on the normal man is to bring him into something like
439,INTRODUCTION,the state in which Coleridge habitually lived. The world was always a
440,INTRODUCTION,"sufficiently unreal thing to him, facts more than remote enough,"
441,INTRODUCTION,"consequences unrelated to their causes; he lived in a mist, and opium"
442,INTRODUCTION,thickened the mist to a dense yellow fog. Opium might have helped to make
443,INTRODUCTION,Southey a poet; it left Coleridge the prisoner of a cobweb-net of dreams.
444,INTRODUCTION,"What he wanted was some astringent force in things, to tighten, not to"
445,INTRODUCTION,"loosen, the always expanding and uncontrollable limits of his mind. Opium"
446,INTRODUCTION,did but confirm what the natural habits of his constitution had bred in
447,INTRODUCTION,"him: an overwhelming indolence, out of which the energies that still arose"
448,INTRODUCTION,"intermittently were no longer flames, but the escaping ghosts of flame,"
449,INTRODUCTION,mere black smoke.
450,INTRODUCTION,
451,INTRODUCTION,"At twenty-four, in a disinterested description of himself for the benefit"
452,INTRODUCTION,"of a friend whom he had not yet met, he declares, ""the walk of the whole"
453,INTRODUCTION,"man indicates _indolence capable of energies_."" It was that walk which"
454,INTRODUCTION,"Carlyle afterwards described, unable to keep to either side of the garden-"
455,INTRODUCTION,"path. ""The moral obligation is to me so very strong a stimulant,"" Coleridge"
456,INTRODUCTION,"writes to Crabb Robinson, ""that in nine cases out of ten it acts as a"
457,INTRODUCTION,"narcotic. The blow that should rouse, _stuns_ me."" He plays another"
458,INTRODUCTION,"variation on the ingenious theme in a letter to his brother: ""Anxieties"
459,INTRODUCTION,that stimulate others infuse an additional narcotic into my mind.... Like
460,INTRODUCTION,"some poor labourer, whose night's sleep has but imperfectly refreshed his"
461,INTRODUCTION,"overwearied frame, I have sate in drowsy uneasiness, and doing nothing have"
462,INTRODUCTION,"thought what a deal I have to do."" His ideal, which he expressed in 1797 in"
463,INTRODUCTION,"a letter to Thelwall, and, in 1813, almost word for word, in a poem called"""
464,INTRODUCTION,"The Night-Scene,"" was, ""like the Indian Vishnu, to float about along an"
465,INTRODUCTION,"infinite ocean cradled in the flower of the Lotus, and wake once in a"
466,INTRODUCTION,million years for a few minutes just to know that I was going to sleep a
467,INTRODUCTION,"million years more."" Observe the effect of the desire for the absolute,"
468,INTRODUCTION,"reinforced by constitutional indolence, and only waiting for the"
469,INTRODUCTION,illuminating excuse of opium.
470,INTRODUCTION,
471,INTRODUCTION,"From these languors, and from their consequences, Coleridge found relief in"
472,INTRODUCTION,"conversation, for which he was always ready, while he was far from always"
473,INTRODUCTION,"ready for the more precise mental exertion of writing. ""Oh, how I wish to"
474,INTRODUCTION,"be talking, not writing,"" he cries in a letter to Southey in 1803, ""for my"
475,INTRODUCTION,"mind is so full, that my thoughts stifle and jam each other."" And, in 1816,"
476,INTRODUCTION,"in his first letter to Gillman, he writes, more significantly, ""The"
477,INTRODUCTION,stimulus of conversation suspends the terror that haunts my mind; but when
478,INTRODUCTION,"I am alone, the horrors that I have suffered from laudanum, the"
479,INTRODUCTION,"degradation, the blighted utility, almost overwhelm me."" It was along one"
480,INTRODUCTION,avenue of this continual escape from himself that Coleridge found himself
481,INTRODUCTION,"driven (anywhere, away from action) towards what grew to be the main waste"
482,INTRODUCTION,"of his life. Hartley Coleridge, in the preface to ""Table-Talk,"" has told us"
483,INTRODUCTION,"eloquently how, ""throughout a long-drawn summer's day, would this man talk"
484,INTRODUCTION,"to you in low, equable, but clear and musical tones, concerning things"
485,INTRODUCTION,"human and divine""; we know that Carlyle found him ""unprofitable, even"
486,INTRODUCTION,"tedious,"" and wished ""to worship him, and toss him in a blanket""; and we"
487,INTRODUCTION,"have the vivid reporting of Keats, who tells us that, on his one meeting"
488,INTRODUCTION,"with Coleridge, ""I walked with him, at his alderman-after-dinner pace, for"
489,INTRODUCTION,"near two miles, I suppose. In those two miles he broached a thousand"
490,INTRODUCTION,things. Let me see if I can give you a list--nightingales--poetry--on
491,INTRODUCTION,poetical sensation--metaphysics--different genera and species of dreams--
492,INTRODUCTION,nightmare--a dream accompanied with a sense of touch--single and double
493,INTRODUCTION,touch--a dream related--first and second consciousness--the difference
494,INTRODUCTION,explained between will and volition--so say metaphysicians from a want of
495,INTRODUCTION,smoking the second consciousness--monsters--the Kraken--mermaids--Southey
496,INTRODUCTION,believes in them--Southey's belief too much diluted--a ghost story--Good-
497,INTRODUCTION,morning--I heard his voice as he came towards me--I heard it as he moved
498,INTRODUCTION,"away--I had heard it all the interval--if it may be called so."" It may be"
499,INTRODUCTION,"that we have had no more wonderful talker, and, no doubt, the talk had its"
500,INTRODUCTION,"reverential listeners, its disciples; but to cultivate or permit disciples"
501,INTRODUCTION,"is itself a kind of waste, a kind of weakness; it requires a very fixed and"
502,INTRODUCTION,"energetic indolence to become, as Coleridge became, a vocal utterance,"
503,INTRODUCTION,talking for talking's sake.
504,INTRODUCTION,
505,INTRODUCTION,"But beside talking, there was lecturing, with Coleridge a scarcely"
506,INTRODUCTION,different form of talk; and it is to this consequence of a readiness to
507,INTRODUCTION,"speak and a reluctance to write that we owe much of his finest criticism,"
508,INTRODUCTION,"in the imperfectly recorded ""Lectures on Shakespeare."" Coleridge as a"
509,INTRODUCTION,"critic is not easily to be summed up. What may first surprise us, when we"
510,INTRODUCTION,"begin to look into his critical opinions, is the uncertainty of his"
511,INTRODUCTION,"judgments in regard to his own work, and to the work of his friends; the"
512,INTRODUCTION,"curious bias which a feeling or an idea, affection or a philosophical"
513,INTRODUCTION,"theory, could give to his mind. His admiration for Southey, his"
514,INTRODUCTION,"consideration for Sotheby, perhaps in a less degree his unconquerable"
515,INTRODUCTION,"esteem for Bowles, together with something very like adulation of"
516,INTRODUCTION,"Wordsworth, are all instances of a certain loss of the sense of proportion."
517,INTRODUCTION,"He has left us no penetrating criticisms of Byron, of Shelley, or of Keats;"
518,INTRODUCTION,"and in a very interesting letter about Blake, written in 1818, he is unable"
519,INTRODUCTION,"to take the poems merely as poems, and chooses among them with a scrupulous"
520,INTRODUCTION,"care ""not for the want of innocence in the poem, but from the too probable"
521,INTRODUCTION,"want of it in many readers."""
522,INTRODUCTION,
523,INTRODUCTION,"Lamb, concerned only with individual things, looks straight at them, not"
524,INTRODUCTION,"through them, seeing them implacably. His notes to the selections from the"
525,INTRODUCTION,Elizabethan dramatists are the surest criticisms that we have in English;
526,INTRODUCTION,they go to the roots. Coleridge's critical power was wholly exercised upon
527,INTRODUCTION,elements and first principles; Lamb showed an infinitely keener sense of
528,INTRODUCTION,"detail, of the parts of the whole. Lamb was unerring on definite points,"
529,INTRODUCTION,and could lay his finger on flaws in Coleridge's work that were invisible
530,INTRODUCTION,"to Coleridge; who, however, was unerring in his broad distinctions, in the"
531,INTRODUCTION,philosophy of his art.
532,INTRODUCTION,
533,INTRODUCTION,"""The ultimate end of criticism,"" said Coleridge, ""is much more to establish"
534,INTRODUCTION,the principles of writing than to furnish rules how to pass judgment on
535,INTRODUCTION,"what has been written by others."" And for this task he had an incomparable"
536,INTRODUCTION,"foundation: imagination, insight, logic, learning, almost every critical"
537,INTRODUCTION,quality united in one; and he was a poet who allowed himself to be a
538,INTRODUCTION,"critic. Those pages of the ""Biographia Literaria,"" in which he defines and"
539,INTRODUCTION,"distinguishes between imagination and fancy, the researches into the"
540,INTRODUCTION,abstract entities of poetry in the course of an examination of Wordsworth's
541,INTRODUCTION,"theories and of the popular objections to them, all that we have of the"
542,INTRODUCTION,"lectures on Shakespeare, into which he put an illuminating idolatry,"
543,INTRODUCTION,"together with notes and jottings preserved in the ""Table-Talk,"" ""Anima"
544,INTRODUCTION,"Poetæ,"" the ""Literary Remains,"" and on the margins of countless books,"
545,INTRODUCTION,contain the most fundamental criticism of literature that has ever been
546,INTRODUCTION,"attempted, fragmentary as the attempt remains. ""There is not a man in"
547,INTRODUCTION,"England,"" said Coleridge, with truth, ""whose thoughts, images, words, and"
548,INTRODUCTION,erudition have been published in larger quantities than _mine_; though
549,INTRODUCTION,"I must admit, not _by_, nor _for_, myself."" He claimed, and"
550,INTRODUCTION,"rightly, as his invention, a ""science of reasoning and judging concerning"
551,INTRODUCTION,"the productions of literature, the characters and measures of public men,"
552,INTRODUCTION,"and the events of nations, by a systematic subsumption of them, under"
553,INTRODUCTION,"principles deduced from the nature of man,"" which, as he says, was unknown"
554,INTRODUCTION,before the year 1795. He is the one philosophical critic who is also a
555,INTRODUCTION,"poet, and thus he is the one critic who instinctively knows his way through"
556,INTRODUCTION,all the intricacies of the creative mind.
557,INTRODUCTION,
558,INTRODUCTION,Most of his best criticism circles around Shakespeare; and he took
559,INTRODUCTION,"Shakespeare almost frankly in the place of Nature, or of poetry. He"
560,INTRODUCTION,"affirms, ""Shakespeare knew the human mind, and its most minute and intimate"
561,INTRODUCTION,"workings, and he never introduces a word, or a thought, in vain or out of"
562,INTRODUCTION,"place."" This granted (and to Coleridge it is essential that it should be"
563,INTRODUCTION,"granted, for in less than the infinite he cannot find space in which to use"
564,INTRODUCTION,"his wings freely) he has only to choose and define, to discover and to"
565,INTRODUCTION,"illuminate. In the ""myriad-minded man,"" in his ""oceanic mind,"" he finds all"
566,INTRODUCTION,the material that he needs for the making of a complete aesthetics. Nothing
567,INTRODUCTION,with Coleridge ever came to completion; but we have only to turn over the
568,INTRODUCTION,"pages about Shakespeare, to come upon fragments worth more than anyone"
569,INTRODUCTION,else's finished work. I find the whole secret of Shakespeare's way of
570,INTRODUCTION,"writing in these sentences: ""Shakespeare's intellectual action is wholly"
571,INTRODUCTION,unlike that of Ben Jonson or Beaumont and Fletcher. The latter see the
572,INTRODUCTION,"totality of a sentence or passage, and then project it entire. Shakespeare"
573,INTRODUCTION,"goes on creating, and evolving B out of A, and C out of B, and so on, just"
574,INTRODUCTION,"as a serpent moves, which makes a fulcrum of its own body, and seems"
575,INTRODUCTION,"forever twisting and untwisting its own strength. ""And here are a few"
576,INTRODUCTION,axioms: 'The grandest efforts of poetry are where the imagination is called
577,INTRODUCTION,"forth, not to produce a distinct form, but a strong working of the mind';"
578,INTRODUCTION,"or, in other words, ""The power of poetry is, by a single word perhaps, to"
579,INTRODUCTION,instill that energy into the mind which compels the imagination to produce
580,INTRODUCTION,"the picture."" ""Poetry is the identity of all other knowledges,"" ""the"
581,INTRODUCTION,"blossom and fragrance of all human knowledge, human thoughts, human"
582,INTRODUCTION,"passions, emotions, language."" ""Verse is in itself a music, and the natural"
583,INTRODUCTION,"symbol of that union of passion with thought and pleasure, which"
584,INTRODUCTION,"constitutes the essence of all poetry ""; ""a more than usual state of"
585,INTRODUCTION,"emotion, with more than usual order,"" as he has elsewhere defined it. And,"
586,INTRODUCTION,"in one of his spoken counsels, he says: ""I wish our clever young poets"
587,INTRODUCTION,"would remember my homely definitions of prose and poetry; that is, prose--"
588,INTRODUCTION,"words in their best order; poetry--the best words in the best order."""
589,INTRODUCTION,
590,INTRODUCTION,"Unlike most creative critics, or most critics who were creative artists in"
591,INTRODUCTION,"another medium, Coleridge, when he was writing criticism, wrote it wholly"
592,INTRODUCTION,"for its own sake, almost as if it were a science. His prose is rarely of"
593,INTRODUCTION,the finest quality as prose writing. Here and there he can strike out a
594,INTRODUCTION,"phrase at red-heat, as when he christens Shakespeare ""the one Proteus of"
595,INTRODUCTION,"the fire and flood""; or he can elaborate subtly, as when he notes the"
596,INTRODUCTION,"judgment of Shakespeare, observable in every scene of the ""Tempest,"" ""still"
597,INTRODUCTION,"preparing, still inviting, and still gratifying, like a finished piece of"
598,INTRODUCTION,"music""; or he can strike us with the wit of the pure intellect, as when he"
599,INTRODUCTION,"condemns certain work for being ""as trivial in thought and yet enigmatic in"
600,INTRODUCTION,"expression, as if Echo and the Sphinx had laid their heads together to"
601,INTRODUCTION,"construct it."" But for the most part it is a kind of thinking aloud, and"
602,INTRODUCTION,the form is wholly lost in the pursuit of ideas. With his love for the
603,INTRODUCTION,"absolute, why is it that he does not seek after an absolute in words"
604,INTRODUCTION,"considered as style, as well as in words considered as the expression of"
605,INTRODUCTION,thought? In his finest verse Coleridge has the finest style perhaps in
606,INTRODUCTION,English; but his prose is never quite reduced to order from its tumultuous
607,INTRODUCTION,amplitude or its snake-like involution. Is it that he values it only as a
608,INTRODUCTION,"medium, not as an art? His art is verse, and this he dreads, because of its"
609,INTRODUCTION,"too mortal closeness to his heart; the prose is a means to an end, not an"
610,INTRODUCTION,end in itself.
611,INTRODUCTION,
612,INTRODUCTION,"The poetry of Coleridge, though it is closely interwoven with the"
613,INTRODUCTION,"circumstances of his life, is rarely made directly out of those"
614,INTRODUCTION,circumstances. To some extent this is no doubt explained by a fact to which
615,INTRODUCTION,"he often refers in his letters, and which, in his own opinion, hindered him"
616,INTRODUCTION,"not only from writing about himself in verse, but from writing verse at"
617,INTRODUCTION,"all. ""As to myself,"" he writes in 1802, ""all my poetic genius ... is gone,"""
618,INTRODUCTION,"and he attributes it ""to my long and exceedingly severe metaphysical"
619,INTRODUCTION,"investigations, and these partly to ill-health, and partly to private"
620,INTRODUCTION,"afflictions which rendered any subjects, immediately connected with"
621,INTRODUCTION,"feeling, a source of pain and disquiet to me."" In 1818 he writes: ""Poetry"
622,INTRODUCTION,is out of the question. The attempt would only hurry me into that sphere of
623,INTRODUCTION,"acute feelings from which abstruse research, the mother of self-oblivion,"
624,INTRODUCTION,"presents an asylum."" But theory worked with a natural tendency in keeping"
625,INTRODUCTION,him for the most part away from any attempt to put his personal emotions
626,INTRODUCTION,"into verse. ""A sound promise of genius,"" he considered, ""is the choice of"
627,INTRODUCTION,subjects very remote from the private interests and circumstances of the
628,INTRODUCTION,"writer himself."" With only a few exceptions, the wholly personal poems,"
629,INTRODUCTION,"those actually written under a shock of emotion, are vague, generalized,"
630,INTRODUCTION,turned into a kind of literature. The success of such a poem as the almost
631,INTRODUCTION,"distressingly personal ""Ode on Dejection"" comes from the fact that"
632,INTRODUCTION,Coleridge has been able to project his personal feeling into an outward
633,INTRODUCTION,"image, which becomes to him the type of dejection; he can look at it as at"
634,INTRODUCTION,one of his dreams which become things; he can sympathize with it as he
635,INTRODUCTION,"could never sympathize with his own undeserving self. And thus one stanza,"
636,INTRODUCTION,"perhaps the finest as poetry, becomes the biography of his soul:"
637,INTRODUCTION,
638,INTRODUCTION,
639,INTRODUCTION,"""There was a time when, though my path was rough,"
640,INTRODUCTION,"This joy within me dallied with distress,"
641,INTRODUCTION,And all misfortunes were but as the stuff
642,INTRODUCTION,Whence Fancy made me dreams of happiness:
643,INTRODUCTION,"For hope grew round me, like the twining vine,"
644,INTRODUCTION,"And fruits, and foliage, not my own, seemed mine"
645,INTRODUCTION,But now afflictions bow me down to earth:
646,INTRODUCTION,Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth;
647,INTRODUCTION,But oh! each visitation
648,INTRODUCTION,"Suspends what nature gave me at my birth,"
649,INTRODUCTION,My shaping spirit of Imagination.
650,INTRODUCTION,"For not to think of what I needs must feel,"
651,INTRODUCTION,"But to be still and patient all I can,"
652,INTRODUCTION,And haply by abstruse research to steal
653,INTRODUCTION,From my own nature all the natural man--
654,INTRODUCTION,"This was my sole resource, my only plan:"
655,INTRODUCTION,"Till that which suits a part infects the whole,"
656,INTRODUCTION,"And now is almost grown the habit of my soul."""
657,INTRODUCTION,
658,INTRODUCTION,
659,INTRODUCTION,"Elsewhere, in personal poems like ""Frost at Midnight,"" and ""Fears in"
660,INTRODUCTION,"Solitude,"" all the value of the poem comes from the delicate sensations of"
661,INTRODUCTION,"natural things which mean so much more to us, whether or not they did to"
662,INTRODUCTION,"him, than the strictly personal part of the matter. You feel that there he"
663,INTRODUCTION,"is only using the quite awake part of himself, which is not the essential"
664,INTRODUCTION,"one. He requires, first of all, to be disinterested, or at least not"
665,INTRODUCTION,"overcome by emotion; to be without passion but that of abstract beauty, in"
666,INTRODUCTION,"Nature, or in idea; and then to sink into a quiet lucid sleep, in which his"
667,INTRODUCTION,genius came to him like some attendant spirit.
668,INTRODUCTION,
669,INTRODUCTION,"In the life and art of Coleridge, the hours of sleep seem to have been"
670,INTRODUCTION,"almost more important than the waking hours. ""My dreams became the"
671,INTRODUCTION,"substance of my life,"" he writes, just after the composition of that"
672,INTRODUCTION,"terrible poem on ""The Pains of Sleep,"" which is at once an outcry of agony,"
673,INTRODUCTION,and a yet more disturbing vision of the sufferer with his fingers on his
674,INTRODUCTION,"own pulse, his eyes fixed on his own hardly awakened eyes in the mirror. In"
675,INTRODUCTION,"an earlier letter, written at a time when he is trying to solve the problem"
676,INTRODUCTION,"of the five senses, he notes: ""The sleep which I have is made up of ideas"
677,INTRODUCTION,"so connected, and so little different from the operations of reason, that"
678,INTRODUCTION,"it does not afford me the due refreshment."" To Coleridge, with the help of"
679,INTRODUCTION,"opium, hardly required, indeed, there was no conscious division between day"
680,INTRODUCTION,"and night, between not only dreams and intuitions, but dreams and pure"
681,INTRODUCTION,"reason. And we find him, in almost all his great poems, frankly taking not"
682,INTRODUCTION,"only his substance but his manner from dreams, as he dramatizes them after"
683,INTRODUCTION,a logic and a passion of their own. His technique is the transposition into
684,INTRODUCTION,his waking hours of the unconscious technique of dreams. It is a kind of
685,INTRODUCTION,"verified inspiration, something which came and went, and was as little to"
686,INTRODUCTION,be relied upon as the inspiration itself. On one side it was an exact
687,INTRODUCTION,"science, but on the other a heavenly visitation. Count and balance"
688,INTRODUCTION,"syllables, work out an addition of the feet in the verse by the foot-rule,"
689,INTRODUCTION,and you will seem to have traced every miracle back to its root in a
690,INTRODUCTION,"natural product. Only, something, that is, everything, will have escaped"
691,INTRODUCTION,you. As well dissect a corpse to find out the principle of life. That
692,INTRODUCTION,"elusive something, that spirit, will be what distinguishes Coleridge's"
693,INTRODUCTION,"finest verse from the verse of, well, perhaps of every conscious artist in"
694,INTRODUCTION,"our language. For it is not, as in Blake, literally unconscious, and"
695,INTRODUCTION,wavering on every breath of that unseen wind on which it floats to us; it
696,INTRODUCTION,"is faultless; it is itself the wind which directs it, it steers its way on"
697,INTRODUCTION,"the wind, like a seagull poised between sky and sea, and turning on its"
698,INTRODUCTION,wings as upon shifted sails.
699,INTRODUCTION,
700,INTRODUCTION,"This inspiration comes upon Coleridge suddenly, without warning, in the"
701,INTRODUCTION,"first uncertain sketch of ""Lewti,"" written at twenty-two; and then it"
702,INTRODUCTION,"leaves him, without warning, until the great year 1797, three years later,"
703,INTRODUCTION,"when ""Christabel"" and ""The Ancient Mariner"" are begun. Before and after,"
704,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge is seen trying to write like Bowles, like Wordsworth, like"
705,INTRODUCTION,"Southey, perhaps, to attain ""that impetuosity of transition and that"
706,INTRODUCTION,"precipitancy of fancy and feeling, which are the _essential_ qualities"
707,INTRODUCTION,"of the sublimer Ode,"" and which he fondly fancies that he has attained in"
708,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Ode on the Departing Year,"" with its one good line, taken out of his"
709,INTRODUCTION,"note-book. But here, in ""Lewti,"" he has his style, his lucid and liquid"
710,INTRODUCTION,"melody, his imagery of moving light and the faintly veiled transparency of"
711,INTRODUCTION,"air, his vague, wildly romantic subject matter, coming from no one knows"
712,INTRODUCTION,"where, meaning one hardly knows what; but already a magic, an incantation."
713,INTRODUCTION,"""Lewti"" is a sort of preliminary study for ""Kubla Khan""; it, too, has all"
714,INTRODUCTION,"the imagery of a dream, with a breathlessness and awed hush, as of one not"
715,INTRODUCTION,yet accustomed to be at home in dreams.
716,INTRODUCTION,
717,INTRODUCTION,"""Kubla Khan,"" which was literally composed in sleep, comes nearer than any"
718,INTRODUCTION,other existing poem to that ideal of lyric poetry which has only lately
719,INTRODUCTION,been systematized by theorists like Mallarmé. It has just enough meaning to
720,INTRODUCTION,give it bodily existence; otherwise it would be disembodied music. It seems
721,INTRODUCTION,"to hover in the air, like one of the island enchantments of Prospero. It is"
722,INTRODUCTION,"music not made with hands, and the words seem, as they literally were,"
723,INTRODUCTION,"remembered. ""All the images,"" said Coleridge, ""rose up before me as"
724,INTRODUCTION,"_things_, with a parallel production of the correspondent"
725,INTRODUCTION,"expressions."" Lamb, who tells us how Coleridge repeated it ""so enchantingly"
726,INTRODUCTION,that it irradiates and brings heaven and elysian bowers into my parlour
727,INTRODUCTION,"when he says or sings it to me,"" doubted whether it would ""bear daylight."""
728,INTRODUCTION,It seemed to him that such witchcraft could hardly outlast the night. It
729,INTRODUCTION,"has outlasted the century, and may still be used as a touchstone; it will"
730,INTRODUCTION,determine the poetic value of any lyric poem which you place beside it.
731,INTRODUCTION,"Take as many poems as you please, and let them have all the merits you"
732,INTRODUCTION,"please, their ultimate merit as poetry will lie in the degree of their"
733,INTRODUCTION,"approach to the exact, unconscious, inevitable balance of qualities in the"
734,INTRODUCTION,"poetic art of ""Kubla Khan."""
735,INTRODUCTION,
736,INTRODUCTION,"In ""The Ancient Mariner,"" which it seems probable was composed before, and"
737,INTRODUCTION,"not after ""Kubla Khan,"" as Coleridge's date would have us suppose, a new"
738,INTRODUCTION,"supernaturalism comes into poetry, which, for the first time, accepted the"
739,INTRODUCTION,"whole responsibility of dreams. The impossible, frankly accepted, with its"
740,INTRODUCTION,"own strict, inverted logic; the creation of a new atmosphere, outside the"
741,INTRODUCTION,"known world, which becomes as real as the air about us, and yet never loses"
742,INTRODUCTION,"its strangeness; the shiver that comes to us, as it came to the wedding-"
743,INTRODUCTION,"guest, from the simple good faith of the teller; here is a whole new"
744,INTRODUCTION,"creation, in subject, mood, and technique. Here, as in ""Kubla Khan,"""
745,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge saw the images ""as _things_""; only a mind so overshadowed by"
746,INTRODUCTION,"dreams, and so easily able to carry on his sleep awake, could have done so;"
747,INTRODUCTION,"and, with such a mind, ""that willing suspension of disbelief for a moment,"
748,INTRODUCTION,"which constitutes poetic faith,"" was literally forced upon him. ""The"
749,INTRODUCTION,"excellence aimed at,"" says Coleridge, ""was to consist in the interesting of"
750,INTRODUCTION,"the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions, as would naturally"
751,INTRODUCTION,"accompany such situations,"" those produced by supernatural agency,"
752,INTRODUCTION,"""supposing them real. And real in this sense they have been to every human"
753,INTRODUCTION,"being who, from whatever sense of delusion, has at any time believed"
754,INTRODUCTION,"himself under supernatural agency."" To Coleridge, whatever appealed vitally"
755,INTRODUCTION,"to his imagination was real; and he defended his belief philosophically,"
756,INTRODUCTION,disbelieving from conviction in that sharp marking off of real from
757,INTRODUCTION,imaginary which is part of the ordinary attitude of man in the presence of
758,INTRODUCTION,mystery.
759,INTRODUCTION,
760,INTRODUCTION,It must not be forgotten that Coleridge is never fantastic. The fantastic
761,INTRODUCTION,"is a playing with the imagination, and Coleridge respects it. His intellect"
762,INTRODUCTION,"goes always easily as far as his imagination will carry it, and does not"
763,INTRODUCTION,stop by the way to play tricks upon its bearer. Hence the conviction which
764,INTRODUCTION,"he brings with him when he tells us the impossible. And then his style, in"
765,INTRODUCTION,"its ardent and luminous simplicity, flexible to every bend of the spirit"
766,INTRODUCTION,"which it clothes with flesh, helps him in the idiomatic translation of"
767,INTRODUCTION,dreams. The visions of Swedenborg are literal translations of the
768,INTRODUCTION,"imagination, and need to be retranslated. Coleridge is equally faithful to"
769,INTRODUCTION,the thing seen and to the laws of that new world into which he has
770,INTRODUCTION,transposed it.
771,INTRODUCTION,
772,INTRODUCTION,"""The Ancient Mariner"" is the most sustained piece of imagination in the"
773,INTRODUCTION,whole of English poetry; and it has almost every definable merit of
774,INTRODUCTION,imaginative narrative. It is the only poem I know which is all point and
775,INTRODUCTION,"yet all poetry; because, I suppose, the point is really a point of mystery."
776,INTRODUCTION,"It is full of simple, daily emotion, transported, by an awful power of"
777,INTRODUCTION,"sight, to which the limits of reality are no barrier, into an unknown sea"
778,INTRODUCTION,and air; it is realized throughout the whole of its ghastly and marvellous
779,INTRODUCTION,"happenings; and there is in the narrative an ease, a buoyancy almost, which"
780,INTRODUCTION,"I can only compare with the music of Mozart, extracting its sweetness from"
781,INTRODUCTION,the stuff of tragedy; it presents to us the utmost physical and spiritual
782,INTRODUCTION,"horror, not only without disgust, but with an alluring beauty. But in"
783,INTRODUCTION,"""Christabel,"" in the first part especially, we find a quality which goes"
784,INTRODUCTION,"almost beyond these definable merits. There is in it a literal spell, not"
785,INTRODUCTION,"acting along any logical lines, not attacking the nerves, not terrifying,"
786,INTRODUCTION,"not intoxicating, but like a slow, enveloping mist, which blots out the"
787,INTRODUCTION,"real world, and leaves us unchilled by any ""airs from heaven or blasts from"
788,INTRODUCTION,"hell,"" but in the native air of some middle region. In these two or three"
789,INTRODUCTION,"brief hours of his power out of a lifetime, Coleridge is literally a"
790,INTRODUCTION,"wizard. People have wanted to know what ""Christabel"" means, and how it was"
791,INTRODUCTION,"to have ended, and whether Geraldine was a vampire (as I am inclined to"
792,INTRODUCTION,think) or had eyes in her breasts (as Shelley thought). They have wondered
793,INTRODUCTION,"that a poem so transparent in every line should be, as a whole, the most"
794,INTRODUCTION,"enigmatical in English. But does it matter very much whether ""Christabel"""
795,INTRODUCTION,"means this or that, and whether Coleridge himself knew, as he said, how it"
796,INTRODUCTION,"was to end, or whether, as Wordsworth declared, he had never decided? It"
797,INTRODUCTION,seems to me that Coleridge was fundamentally right when he said of the
798,INTRODUCTION,"""Ancient Mariner,"" ""It ought to have had no more moral than the Arabian"
799,INTRODUCTION,Nights' tale of the merchant's sitting down to eat dates by the side of a
800,INTRODUCTION,"well, and throwing the shells aside, and lo! a genie starts up, and says he"
801,INTRODUCTION,"_must_ kill the aforesaid merchant, because one of the date-shells"
802,INTRODUCTION,"had, it seems, put out the eye of the genie's son."" The ""Ancient Mariner,"""
803,INTRODUCTION,"if we take its moral meaning too seriously, comes near to being an"
804,INTRODUCTION,"allegory. ""Christabel,"" as it stands, is a piece of pure witchcraft,"
805,INTRODUCTION,needing no further explanation than the fact of its existence.
806,INTRODUCTION,
807,INTRODUCTION,"Rossetti called Coleridge the Turner of poets, and indeed there is in"
808,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge an aërial glitter which we find in no other poet, and in Turner"
809,INTRODUCTION,"only among painters. With him colour is always melted in atmosphere, which"
810,INTRODUCTION,"it shines through like fire within a crystal. It is liquid colour, the dew"
811,INTRODUCTION,"on flowers, or a mist of rain in bright sunshine. His images are for the"
812,INTRODUCTION,"most part derived from water, sky, the changes of weather, shadows of"
813,INTRODUCTION,"things rather than things themselves, and usually mental reflections of"
814,INTRODUCTION,"them. ""A poet ought not to pick Nature's pocket,"" he said, and it is for"
815,INTRODUCTION,"colour and sound, in their most delicate forms, that he goes to natural"
816,INTRODUCTION,things. He hears
817,INTRODUCTION,
818,INTRODUCTION,
819,INTRODUCTION,"""the merry nightingale"
820,INTRODUCTION,That crowds and hurries and precipitates
821,INTRODUCTION,"With fast thick warble his delicious notes;"""
822,INTRODUCTION,
823,INTRODUCTION,
824,INTRODUCTION,and an ecstasy comes to him out of that natural music which is almost like
825,INTRODUCTION,that of his own imagination. Only music or strange effects of light can
826,INTRODUCTION,"carry him swiftly enough out of himself, in the presence of visible or"
827,INTRODUCTION,"audible things, for that really poetic ecstasy. Then all his languor drops"
828,INTRODUCTION,"off from him, like a clogging garment."
829,INTRODUCTION,
830,INTRODUCTION,The first personal merit which appears in his almost wholly valueless early
831,INTRODUCTION,work is a sense of colour. In a poem written at twenty-one he sees Fancy
832,INTRODUCTION,
833,INTRODUCTION,
834,INTRODUCTION,"""Bathed in rich amber-glowing floods of light,"""
835,INTRODUCTION,
836,INTRODUCTION,
837,INTRODUCTION,"and next year the same colour reappears, more expressively, in a cloud,"
838,INTRODUCTION,
839,INTRODUCTION,
840,INTRODUCTION,"""wholly bright,"
841,INTRODUCTION,"With a rich and amber light."""
842,INTRODUCTION,
843,INTRODUCTION,
844,INTRODUCTION,"The two women in ""The Two Graves,"" during a momentous pause, are found"
845,INTRODUCTION,discussing whether the rays of the sun are green or amber; a valley is
846,INTRODUCTION,
847,INTRODUCTION,
848,INTRODUCTION,"""Tinged yellow with the rich departing light;"""

862,INTRODUCTION,
863,INTRODUCTION,
864,INTRODUCTION,"""The Ancient Mariner"" is full of images of light and luminous colour in sky"
865,INTRODUCTION,"and sea; Glycine's song in ""Zapolya"" is the most glittering poem in our"
866,INTRODUCTION,"language, with a soft glitter like that of light seen through water. And he"
867,INTRODUCTION,"is continually endeavouring, as later poets have done on a more deliberate"
868,INTRODUCTION,"theory, to suffuse sound with colour or make colours literally a form of"
869,INTRODUCTION,music; as in an early poem
870,INTRODUCTION,
871,INTRODUCTION,
872,INTRODUCTION,"""Where melodies round honey-dropping flowers,"
873,INTRODUCTION,"Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise,"
874,INTRODUCTION,"Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untamed wing."""
875,INTRODUCTION,
876,INTRODUCTION,
877,INTRODUCTION,"With him, as with some of them, there is something pathological in this"
878,INTRODUCTION,"sensitiveness, and in a letter written in 180O he says: ""For the last month"
879,INTRODUCTION,I have been trembling on through sands and swamps of evil and bodily
880,INTRODUCTION,grievance. My eyes have been inflamed to a degree that rendered reading
881,INTRODUCTION,"scarcely possible; and, strange as it seems, the act of mere composition,"
882,INTRODUCTION,"as I lay in bed, perceptibly affected them, and my voluntary ideas were"
883,INTRODUCTION,"every minute passing, more or less transformed into vivid spectra."""
884,INTRODUCTION,
885,INTRODUCTION,"Side by side with this sensitiveness to colour, or interfused with it, we"
886,INTRODUCTION,"find a similar, or perhaps a greater, sensitiveness to sound, Coleridge"
887,INTRODUCTION,shows a greater sensitiveness to music than any English poet except Milton.
888,INTRODUCTION,The sonnet to Linley records his ecstatic responsiveness to music;
889,INTRODUCTION,"Purcell's music, too, which he names with Palestrina's (""some madrigals"
890,INTRODUCTION,"which he heard at Rome"") in the ""Table-Talk."" ""I have the intensest delight"
891,INTRODUCTION,"in music,"" he says there, ""and can detect good from bad""; a rare thing"
892,INTRODUCTION,"among poets. In one of his letters he notes: ""I hear in my brain ..."
893,INTRODUCTION,"sensations ... of various degrees of pain, even to a strange sort of uneasy"
894,INTRODUCTION,"pleasure.... I hear in my brain, and still more in my stomach."" There we"
895,INTRODUCTION,get the morbid physical basis of a sensitiveness to music which came to
896,INTRODUCTION,"mean much to him. In a note referring to ""Christabel,"" and to the reasons"
897,INTRODUCTION,"why it had never been finished, he says: ""I could write as good verse now"
898,INTRODUCTION,"as ever I did, if I were perfectly free from vexations, and were in the"
899,INTRODUCTION,"_ad libitum_ hearing of fine music, which has a sensible effect in"
900,INTRODUCTION,"harmonizing my thoughts, and in animating and, as it were, lubricating my"
901,INTRODUCTION,"inventive faculty."" ""Christabel,"" more than anything of Coleridge, is"
902,INTRODUCTION,"composed like music; you might set at the side of each section, especially"
903,INTRODUCTION,"of the opening, _largo, vivacissimo_, and, as the general expression"
904,INTRODUCTION,"signature, _tempo rubato_. I know no other verse in which the effects"
905,INTRODUCTION,"of music are so precisely copied in metre. Shelley, you feel, sings like a"
906,INTRODUCTION,"bird; Blake, like a child or an angel; but Coleridge certainly writes"
907,INTRODUCTION,music.
908,INTRODUCTION,
909,INTRODUCTION,"The metre of the ""Ancient Mariner"" is a re-reading of the familiar ballad-"
910,INTRODUCTION,"metre, in which nothing of the original force, swiftness or directness is"
911,INTRODUCTION,"lost, while a new subtlety, a wholly new music, has come into it. The metre"
912,INTRODUCTION,"of ""Christabel"" is even more of an invention, and it had more immediate"
913,INTRODUCTION,"consequences. The poem was begun in 1797, and not published till 1816; but"
914,INTRODUCTION,"in 1801 Scott heard it recited, and in 1805 reproduced what he could of it"
915,INTRODUCTION,"in ""The Lay of the Last Minstrel"" and the other metrical romances which, in"
916,INTRODUCTION,"their turn, led the way to Byron, who himself heard ""Christabel"" recited in"
917,INTRODUCTION,1811. But the secret of Coleridge's instinct of melody and science of
918,INTRODUCTION,"harmony was not discovered. Such ecstasy and such collectedness, a way of"
919,INTRODUCTION,writing which seems to aim at nothing but the most precisely expressive
920,INTRODUCTION,"simplicity, and yet sets the whole brain dancing to its tune, can hardly be"
921,INTRODUCTION,indicated more exactly than in Coleridge's own words in reference to the
922,INTRODUCTION,"Italian lyrists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They, attained"
923,INTRODUCTION,"their aim, he says, ""by the avoidance of every word which a gentleman would"
924,INTRODUCTION,"not use in dignified conversation, and of every word and phrase which none"
925,INTRODUCTION,"but a learned man would use; by the studied position of words and phrases,"
926,INTRODUCTION,"so that not only each part should be melodious in itself, but contribute to"
927,INTRODUCTION,"the harmony of the whole, each note referring and conducing to the melody"
928,INTRODUCTION,"of all the foregoing and following words of the same period or stanza; and,"
929,INTRODUCTION,"lastly, with equal labour, the greater because unbetrayed, by the variation"
930,INTRODUCTION,"and various harmonies of their metrical movement."" These qualities we may"
931,INTRODUCTION,"indeed find in many of Coleridge's songs, part Elizabethan, part eighteenth"
932,INTRODUCTION,"century, in some of his infantile jingles, his exuberant comic verse (in"
933,INTRODUCTION,"which, however, there are many words ""which a gentleman would not use""),"
934,INTRODUCTION,"and in a poem like ""Love,"" which has suffered as much indiscriminate praise"
935,INTRODUCTION,"as Raphael's Madonnas, which it resembles in technique and sentiment, and"
936,INTRODUCTION,"in its exquisite perfection of commonplace, its _tour de force _of an"
937,INTRODUCTION,"almost flawless girlishness. But in ""Christabel"" the technique has an"
938,INTRODUCTION,"incomparable substance to work upon; substance at once simple and abnormal,"
939,INTRODUCTION,"which Coleridge required, in order to be at his best."
940,INTRODUCTION,
941,INTRODUCTION,It has been pointed out by the profoundest poetical critic of our time that
942,INTRODUCTION,the perfection of Coleridge's style in poetry comes from an equal balance
943,INTRODUCTION,"of the clear, somewhat matter-of-fact qualities of the eighteenth century"
944,INTRODUCTION,"with the remote, imaginative qualities of the nineteenth century. ""To"
945,INTRODUCTION,"please me,"" said Coleridge in ""Table-Talk,"" ""a poem must be either music or"
946,INTRODUCTION,"sense."" The eighteenth-century manner, with its sense only just coupled"
947,INTRODUCTION,"with a kind of tame and wingless music, may be seen quite by itself in the"
948,INTRODUCTION,"early song from ""Robespierre"":"
949,INTRODUCTION,
950,INTRODUCTION,
951,INTRODUCTION,"""Tell me, on what holy ground"
952,INTRODUCTION,"May domestic peace be found?"""
953,INTRODUCTION,
954,INTRODUCTION,
955,INTRODUCTION,"Here there is both matter and manner, of a kind; in ""The Kiss"" of the same"
956,INTRODUCTION,"year, with its one exquisite line,"
957,INTRODUCTION,
958,INTRODUCTION,
959,INTRODUCTION,"""The gentle violence of joy,"""
960,INTRODUCTION,
961,INTRODUCTION,
962,INTRODUCTION,there is only the liquid glitter of manner. We get the ultimate union of
963,INTRODUCTION,"eighteenth and nineteenth century qualities in ""Work without Hope,"" and in"
964,INTRODUCTION,"""Youth and Age,"" which took nine years to bring into its faultless ultimate"
965,INTRODUCTION,form. There is always a tendency in Coleridge to fall back on the
966,INTRODUCTION,"eighteenth-century manner, with its scrupulous exterior neatness, and its"
967,INTRODUCTION,"comfortable sense of something definite said definitely, whenever the"
968,INTRODUCTION,"double inspiration flags, and matter and manner do not come together. ""I"
969,INTRODUCTION,"cannot write without a _body of thought_,"" he said at a time before he"
970,INTRODUCTION,"had found himself or his style; and he added: ""Hence my poetry is crowded"
971,INTRODUCTION,and sweats beneath a heavy burden of ideas and imagery! It has seldom
972,INTRODUCTION,"ease."" It was an unparalleled ease in the conveying of a ""body of thought"""
973,INTRODUCTION,"that he was finally to attain. In ""Youth and Age,"" think how much is"
974,INTRODUCTION,"actually said, and with a brevity impossible in prose; things, too, far"
975,INTRODUCTION,"from easy for poetry to say gracefully, such as the image of the steamer,"
976,INTRODUCTION,"or the frank reference to ""this altered size""; and then see with what an"
977,INTRODUCTION,"art, as of the very breathing of syllables, it passes into the most flowing"
978,INTRODUCTION,"of lyric forms. Besides these few miracles of his later years, there are"
979,INTRODUCTION,"many poems, such as the Flaxman group of ""Love, Hope, and Patience"
980,INTRODUCTION,"supporting Education,"" in which we get all that can be poetic in the"
981,INTRODUCTION,"epigram softened by imagination, all that can be given by an ecstatic plain"
982,INTRODUCTION,"thinking. The rarest magic has gone, and he knows it; philosophy remains,"
983,INTRODUCTION,"and out of that resisting material he is able, now and again, to weave, in"
984,INTRODUCTION,"his deftest manner, a few garlands."

1158,PART II,"The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,"
1159,PART II,The furrow followed free;
1160,PART II,We were the first that ever burst
1161,PART II,Into that silent sea.
1162,PART II,
1163,PART II,"Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,"
1164,PART II,'Twas sad as sad could be;
1165,PART II,And we did speak only to break
1166,PART II,The silence of the sea!
1167,PART II,
1168,PART II,"All in a hot and copper sky,"
1169,PART II,"The bloody Sun, at noon,"
1170,PART II,"Right up above the mast did stand,"
1171,PART II,No bigger than the Moon.
1172,PART II,
1173,PART II,"Day after day, day after day,"
1174,PART II,"We stuck, nor breath nor motion;"
1175,PART II,As idle as a painted ship
1176,PART II,Upon a painted ocean.
1177,PART II,
1178,PART II,"Water, water, every where,"
1179,PART II,And all the boards did shrink;
1180,PART II,"Water, water, every where"
1181,PART II,Nor any drop to drink.
1182,PART II,
1183,PART II,The very deep did rot: O Christ!
1184,PART II,That ever this should be!
1185,PART II,"Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs"
1186,PART II,Upon the slimy sea.
1187,PART II,
1188,PART II,"About, about, in reel and rout"
1189,PART II,The death-fires danced at night;
1190,PART II,"The water, like a witch's oils,"
1191,PART II,"Burnt green, and blue and white."
1192,PART II,
1193,PART II,"And some in dreams assured were ,"
1194,PART II,Of the Spirit that plagued us so;
1195,PART II,Nine fathom deep he had followed us
1196,PART II,From the land of mist and snow.
1197,PART II,
1198,PART II,"And every tongue, through utter drought,"
1199,PART II,Was withered at the root;
1200,PART II,"We could not speak, no more than if"
1201,PART II,We had been choked with soot.
1202,PART II,
1203,PART II,Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
1204,PART II,Had I from old and young!
1205,PART II,"Instead of the cross, the Albatross"
1206,PART II,About my neck was hung.
1207,PART II,
1208,PART II,
1209,PART III,PART III
1210,PART III,
1211,PART III,
1212,PART III,There passed a weary time. Each throat
1213,PART III,"Was parched, and glazed each eye."
1214,PART III,A weary time! a weary time!
1215,PART III,"How glazed each weary eye,"
1216,PART III,"When looking westward, I beheld"
1217,PART III,A something in the sky.
1218,PART III,
1219,PART III,"At first it seemed a little speck,"
1220,PART III,And then it seemed a mist;
1221,PART III,"It moved and moved, and took at last"
1222,PART III,"A certain shape, I wist."
1223,PART III,
1224,PART III,"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!"
1225,PART III,And still it neared and neared:
1226,PART III,"As if it dodged a water-sprite,"
1227,PART III,It plunged and tacked and veered.
1228,PART III,
1229,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
1230,PART III,We could nor laugh nor wail;
1231,PART III,Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
1232,PART III,"I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,"
1233,PART III,"And cried, A sail! a sail!"
1234,PART III,
1235,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
1236,PART III,Agape they heard me call:
1237,PART III,"Gramercy! they for joy did grin,"
1238,PART III,"And all at once their breath drew in,"
1239,PART III,As they were drinking all.
1240,PART III,
1241,PART III,See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
1242,PART III,Hither to work us weal;
1243,PART III,"Without a breeze, without a tide,"
1244,PART III,She steadies with upright keel!
1245,PART III,
1246,PART III,"The western wave was all a-flame,"
1247,PART III,The day was well nigh done!
1248,PART III,Almost upon the western wave
1249,PART III,Rested the broad bright Sun;
1250,PART III,When that strange shape drove suddenly
1251,PART III,Betwixt us and the Sun.
1252,PART III,
1253,PART III,"And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,"
1254,PART III,(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
1255,PART III,As if through a dungeon-grate he peered
1256,PART III,With broad and burning face.
1257,PART III,
1258,PART III,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)"
1259,PART III,How fast she nears and nears!
1260,PART III,"Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,"
1261,PART III,Like restless gossameres?
1262,PART III,
1263,PART III,Are those her ribs through which the Sun
1264,PART III,"Did peer, as through a grate?"
1265,PART III,And is that Woman all her crew?
1266,PART III,Is that a Death? and are there two?
1267,PART III,Is Death that Woman's mate?
1268,PART III,
1269,PART III,"Her lips were red, her looks were free,"
1270,PART III,Her locks were yellow as gold:
1271,PART III,"Her skin was as white as leprosy,"
1272,PART III,"The Night-mare Life-in-Death was she,"
1273,PART III,Who thicks man's blood with cold.
1274,PART III,
1275,PART III,"The naked hulk alongside came,"
1276,PART III,And the twain were casting dice;
1277,PART III,"""The game is done! I've won! I've won!"""
1278,PART III,"Quoth she, and whistles thrice."
1279,PART III,
1280,PART III,The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
1281,PART III,At one stride comes the dark;
1282,PART III,"With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,"
1283,PART III,Off shot the spectre-bark.
1284,PART III,
1285,PART III,We listened and looked sideways up!
1286,PART III,"Fear at my heart, as at a cup,"
1287,PART III,My life-blood seemed to sip!
1288,PART III,"The stars were dim, and thick the night,"
1289,PART III,The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
1290,PART III,From the sails the dew did drip--
1291,PART III,Till clomb above the eastern bar
1292,PART III,"The horned Moon, with one bright star"
1293,PART III,Within the nether tip.
1294,PART III,
1295,PART III,"One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,"
1296,PART III,"Too quick for groan or sigh,"
1297,PART III,"Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,"
1298,PART III,And cursed me with his eye.
1299,PART III,
1300,PART III,"Four times fifty living men,"
1301,PART III,(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
1302,PART III,"With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,"
1303,PART III,They dropped down one by one.
1304,PART III,
1305,PART III,"The souls did from their bodies fly,--"
1306,PART III,They fled to bliss or woe!
1307,PART III,"And every soul, it passed me by,"
1308,PART III,Like the whizz of my cross-bow!
1309,PART III,
1310,PART III,
1311,PART IV,PART IV
1312,PART IV,
1313,PART IV,
1314,PART IV,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"
1315,PART IV,I fear thy skinny hand!
1316,PART IV,"And thou art long, and lank, and brown,"
1317,PART IV,As is the ribbed sea-sand.[1]
1318,PART IV,
1319,PART IV,"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,"
1320,PART IV,"And thy skinny hand, so brown.""--"
1321,PART IV,"Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!"
1322,PART IV,This body dropt not down.
1323,PART IV,
1324,PART IV,"Alone, alone, all, all alone,"
1325,PART IV,Alone on a wide wide sea!
1326,PART IV,And never a saint took pity on
1327,PART IV,My soul in agony.
1328,PART IV,
1329,PART IV,"The many men, so beautiful!"
1330,PART IV,And they all dead did lie:
1331,PART IV,And a thousand thousand slimy things
1332,PART IV,Lived on; and so did I.
1333,PART IV,
1334,PART IV,"I looked upon the rotting sea,"
1335,PART IV,And drew my eyes away;
1336,PART IV,"I looked upon the rotting deck,"
1337,PART IV,And there the dead men lay.
1338,PART IV,
1339,PART IV,"I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;"
1340,PART IV,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,"
1341,PART IV,"A wicked whisper came, and made"
1342,PART IV,My heart as dry as dust.
1343,PART IV,
1344,PART IV,"I closed my lids, and kept them close,"
1345,PART IV,And the balls like pulses beat;
1346,PART IV,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky,"
1347,PART IV,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
1348,PART IV,And the dead were at my feet.
1349,PART IV,
1350,PART IV,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,"
1351,PART IV,Nor rot nor reek did they:
1352,PART IV,The look with which they looked on me
1353,PART IV,Had never passed away.
1354,PART IV,
1355,PART IV,An orphan's curse would drag to hell
1356,PART IV,A spirit from on high;
1357,PART IV,But oh! more horrible than that
1358,PART IV,Is a curse in a dead man's eye!
1359,PART IV,"Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,"
1360,PART IV,And yet I could not die.
1361,PART IV,
1362,PART IV,"The moving Moon went up the sky,"
1363,PART IV,And no where did abide:
1364,PART IV,"Softly she was going up,"
1365,PART IV,And a star or two beside--
1366,PART IV,
1367,PART IV,"Her beams bemocked the sultry main,"
1368,PART IV,Like April hoar-frost spread;
1369,PART IV,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
1370,PART IV,The charmed water burnt alway
1371,PART IV,A still and awful red.
1372,PART IV,
1373,PART IV,"Beyond the shadow of the ship,"
1374,PART IV,I watched the water-snakes:
1375,PART IV,"They moved in tracks of shining white,"
1376,PART IV,"And when they reared, the elfish light"
1377,PART IV,Fell off in hoary flakes.
1378,PART IV,
1379,PART IV,Within the shadow of the ship
1380,PART IV,I watched their rich attire:
1381,PART IV,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,"
1382,PART IV,They coiled and swam; and every track
1383,PART IV,Was a flash of golden fire.
1384,PART IV,
1385,PART IV,O happy living things! no tongue
1386,PART IV,Their beauty might declare:
1387,PART IV,"A spring of love gushed from my heart,"
1388,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware:
1389,PART IV,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
1390,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware.
1391,PART IV,
1392,PART IV,The selfsame moment I could pray;
1393,PART IV,And from my neck so free
1394,PART IV,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
1395,PART IV,Like lead into the sea.
1396,PART IV,
1397,PART IV,
1398,PART V,PART V
1399,PART V,
1400,PART V,
1401,PART V,"Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,"
1402,PART V,Beloved from pole to pole!
1403,PART V,To Mary Queen the praise be given!
1404,PART V,"She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,"
1405,PART V,That slid into my soul.
1406,PART V,
1407,PART V,"The silly buckets on the deck,"
1408,PART V,"That had so long remained,"
1409,PART V,I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
1410,PART V,"And when I awoke, it rained."
1411,PART V,
1412,PART V,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
1413,PART V,My garments all were dank;
1414,PART V,"Sure I had drunken in my dreams,"
1415,PART V,And still my body drank.
1416,PART V,
1417,PART V,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:"
1418,PART V,I was so light--almost
1419,PART V,I thought that I had died in sleep;
1420,PART V,And was a blessed ghost.
1421,PART V,
1422,PART V,And soon I heard a roaring wind:
1423,PART V,It did not come anear;
1424,PART V,"But with its sound it shook the sails,"
1425,PART V,That were so thin and sere.
1426,PART V,
1427,PART V,The upper air burst into life!
1428,PART V,"And a hundred fire-flags sheen,"
1429,PART V,To and fro they were hurried about!
1430,PART V,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
1431,PART V,The wan stars danced between.
1432,PART V,
1433,PART V,"And the coming wind did roar more loud,"
1434,PART V,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
1435,PART V,And the rain poured down from one black cloud;
1436,PART V,The Moon was at its edge.
1437,PART V,
1438,PART V,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
1439,PART V,The Moon was at its side:
1440,PART V,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
1441,PART V,"The lightning fell with never a jag,"
1442,PART V,A river steep and wide.
1443,PART V,
1444,PART V,"The loud wind never reached the ship,"
1445,PART V,Yet now the ship moved on!
1446,PART V,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
1447,PART V,The dead men gave a groan.
1448,PART V,
1449,PART V,"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,"
1450,PART V,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
1451,PART V,"It had been strange, even in a dream,!"
1452,PART V,To have seen those dead men rise.
1453,PART V,
1454,PART V,"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;"
1455,PART V,Yet never a breeze up blew;
1456,PART V,"The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,"
1457,PART V,Where they were wont to do;
1458,PART V,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
1459,PART V,We were a ghastly crew.
1460,PART V,
1461,PART V,The body of my brother's son
1462,PART V,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
1463,PART V,The body and I pulled at one rope
1464,PART V,But he said nought to me.
1465,PART V,
1466,PART V,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"""
1467,PART V,"Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!"
1468,PART V,"'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,"
1469,PART V,"Which to their corses came again,"
1470,PART V,But a troop of spirits blest:
1471,PART V,
1472,PART V,"For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,"
1473,PART V,And clustered round the mast;
1474,PART V,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
1475,PART V,And from their bodies passed.
1476,PART V,
1477,PART V,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
1478,PART V,Then darted to the Sun;
1479,PART V,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
1480,PART V,"Now mixed, now one by one."
1481,PART V,
1482,PART V,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
1483,PART V,I heard the sky-lark sing;
1484,PART V,"Sometimes all little birds that are,"
1485,PART V,How they seemed to fill the sea and air
1486,PART V,With their sweet jargoning!
1487,PART V,
1488,PART V,"And now 'twas like all instruments,"
1489,PART V,Now like a lonely flute;
1490,PART V,"And now it is an angel's song,"
1491,PART V,That makes the heavens be mute.
1492,PART V,
1493,PART V,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
1494,PART V,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
1495,PART V,A noise like of a hidden brook
1496,PART V,"In the leafy month of June,"
1497,PART V,That to the sleeping woods all night
1498,PART V,Singeth a quiet tune.
1499,PART V,
1500,PART V,"Till noon we quietly sailed on,"
1501,PART V,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
1502,PART V,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,"
1503,PART V,Moved onward from beneath.
1504,PART V,
1505,PART V,"Under the keel nine fathom deep,"
1506,PART V,"From the land of mist and snow,"
1507,PART V,The spirit slid: and it was he
1508,PART V,That made the ship to go.
1509,PART V,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
1510,PART V,And the ship stood still also.
1511,PART V,
1512,PART V,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
1513,PART V,Had fixed her to the ocean:
1514,PART V,"But in a minute she 'gan stir,"
1515,PART V,With a short uneasy motion--
1516,PART V,Backwards and forwards half her length
1517,PART V,With a short uneasy motion.
1518,PART V,
1519,PART V,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
1520,PART V,She made a sudden bound:
1521,PART V,"It flung the blood into my head,"
1522,PART V,And I fell down in a swound.
1523,PART V,
1524,PART V,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
1525,PART V,I have not to declare;
1526,PART V,"But ere my living life returned,"
1527,PART V,I heard and in my soul discerned
1528,PART V,Two voices in the air.
1529,PART V,
1530,PART V,"""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""Is this the man?"
1531,PART V,"By him who died on cross,"
1532,PART V,With his cruel bow he laid full low
1533,PART V,The harmless Albatross.
1534,PART V,
1535,PART V,The spirit who bideth by himself
1536,PART V,"In the land of mist and snow,"
1537,PART V,He loved the bird that loved the man
1538,PART V,"Who shot him with his bow."""
1539,PART V,
1540,PART V,"The other was a softer voice,"
1541,PART V,As soft as honey-dew:
1542,PART V,"Quoth he, ""The man hath penance done,"
1543,PART V,"And penance more will do."""
1544,PART V,
1545,PART V,
1546,PART VI,PART VI
1547,PART VI,
1548,PART VI,
1549,FIRST VOICE,FIRST VOICE
1550,FIRST VOICE,
1551,FIRST VOICE,"""But tell me, tell me! speak again,"
1552,FIRST VOICE,Thy soft response renewing--
1553,FIRST VOICE,What makes that ship drive on so fast?
1554,FIRST VOICE,"What is the ocean doing?"""
1555,FIRST VOICE,
1556,SECOND VOICE,SECOND VOICE
1557,SECOND VOICE,
1558,SECOND VOICE,"""Still as a slave before his lord,"
1559,SECOND VOICE,The ocean hath no blast;
1560,SECOND VOICE,His great bright eye most silently
1561,SECOND VOICE,Up to the Moon is cast--
1562,SECOND VOICE,
1563,SECOND VOICE,If he may know which way to go;
1564,SECOND VOICE,For she guides him smooth or grim.
1565,SECOND VOICE,"See, brother, see! how graciously"
1566,SECOND VOICE,"She looketh down on him."""
1567,SECOND VOICE,
1568,FIRST VOICE,FIRST VOICE
1569,FIRST VOICE,
1570,FIRST VOICE,"""But why drives on that ship so fast,"
1571,FIRST VOICE,"Without or wave or wind?"""
1572,FIRST VOICE,
1573,SECOND VOICE,SECOND VOICE
1574,SECOND VOICE,
1575,SECOND VOICE,"""The air is cut away before,"
1576,SECOND VOICE,And closes from behind.
1577,SECOND VOICE,
1578,SECOND VOICE,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!"
1579,SECOND VOICE,Or we shall be belated:
1580,SECOND VOICE,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
1581,SECOND VOICE,"When the Mariner's trance is abated."""
1582,SECOND VOICE,
1583,SECOND VOICE,"I woke, and we were sailing on"
1584,SECOND VOICE,As in a gentle weather:
1585,SECOND VOICE,"'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high,"
1586,SECOND VOICE,The dead men stood together.
1587,SECOND VOICE,
1588,SECOND VOICE,"All stood together on the deck,"
1589,SECOND VOICE,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
1590,SECOND VOICE,"All fixed on me their stony eyes,"
1591,SECOND VOICE,That in the Moon did glitter.
1592,SECOND VOICE,
1593,SECOND VOICE,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
1594,SECOND VOICE,Had never passed away:
1595,SECOND VOICE,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,"
1596,SECOND VOICE,Nor turn them up to pray.
1597,SECOND VOICE,
1598,SECOND VOICE,And now this spell was snapt: once more
1599,SECOND VOICE,"I viewed the ocean green,"
1600,SECOND VOICE,"And looked far forth, yet little saw"
1601,SECOND VOICE,Of what had else been seen--
1602,SECOND VOICE,
1603,SECOND VOICE,"Like one, that on a lonesome road"
1604,SECOND VOICE,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
1605,SECOND VOICE,"And having once turned round walks on,"
1606,SECOND VOICE,And turns no more his head;
1607,SECOND VOICE,"Because he knows, a frightful fiend"
1608,SECOND VOICE,Doth close behind him tread.
1609,SECOND VOICE,
1610,SECOND VOICE,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
1611,SECOND VOICE,Nor sound nor motion made:
1612,SECOND VOICE,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
1613,SECOND VOICE,In ripple or in shade.
1614,SECOND VOICE,
1615,SECOND VOICE,"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek"
1616,SECOND VOICE,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
1617,SECOND VOICE,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
1618,SECOND VOICE,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
1619,SECOND VOICE,
1620,SECOND VOICE,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,"
1621,SECOND VOICE,Yet she sailed softly too:
1622,SECOND VOICE,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
1623,SECOND VOICE,On me alone it blew.
1624,SECOND VOICE,
1625,SECOND VOICE,Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
1626,SECOND VOICE,The light-house top I see?
1627,SECOND VOICE,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
1628,SECOND VOICE,Is this mine own countree?
1629,SECOND VOICE,
1630,SECOND VOICE,"We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,"
1631,SECOND VOICE,And I with sobs did pray--
1632,SECOND VOICE,"O let me be awake, my God!"
1633,SECOND VOICE,Or let me sleep alway.
1634,SECOND VOICE,
1635,SECOND VOICE,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
1636,SECOND VOICE,So smoothly it was strewn!
1637,SECOND VOICE,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
1638,SECOND VOICE,And the shadow of the Moon.
1639,SECOND VOICE,
1640,SECOND VOICE,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,"
1641,SECOND VOICE,That stands above the rock:
1642,SECOND VOICE,The moonlight steeped in silentness
1643,SECOND VOICE,The steady weathercock.
1644,SECOND VOICE,
1645,SECOND VOICE,And the bay was white with silent light
1646,SECOND VOICE,"Till rising from the same,"
1647,SECOND VOICE,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
1648,SECOND VOICE,In crimson colours came.
1649,SECOND VOICE,
1650,SECOND VOICE,A little distance from the prow
1651,SECOND VOICE,Those crimson shadows were:
1652,SECOND VOICE,I turned my eyes upon the deck--
1653,SECOND VOICE,"Oh, Christ! what saw I there!"
1654,SECOND VOICE,
1655,SECOND VOICE,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
1656,SECOND VOICE,"And, by the holy rood!"
1657,SECOND VOICE,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
1658,SECOND VOICE,On every corse there stood.
1659,SECOND VOICE,
1660,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:"
1661,SECOND VOICE,It was a heavenly sight!
1662,SECOND VOICE,"They stood as signals to the land,"
1663,SECOND VOICE,Each one a lovely light;
1664,SECOND VOICE,
1665,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
1666,SECOND VOICE,No voice did they impart--
1667,SECOND VOICE,No voice; but oh! the silence sank
1668,SECOND VOICE,Like music on my heart.
1669,SECOND VOICE,
1670,SECOND VOICE,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,"
1671,SECOND VOICE,I heard the Pilot's cheer;
1672,SECOND VOICE,"My head was turned perforce away,"
1673,SECOND VOICE,And I saw a boat appear.
1674,SECOND VOICE,
1675,SECOND VOICE,"The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,"
1676,SECOND VOICE,I heard them coming fast:
1677,SECOND VOICE,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
1678,SECOND VOICE,The dead men could not blast.
1679,SECOND VOICE,
1680,SECOND VOICE,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
1681,SECOND VOICE,It is the Hermit good!
1682,SECOND VOICE,He singeth loud his godly hymns
1683,SECOND VOICE,That he makes in the wood.
1684,SECOND VOICE,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away"
1685,SECOND VOICE,The Albatross's blood.
1686,SECOND VOICE,
1687,SECOND VOICE,
1688,PART VII,PART VII
1689,PART VII,
1690,PART VII,
1691,PART VII,This Hermit good lives in that wood
1692,PART VII,Which slopes down to the sea.
1693,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
1694,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
1695,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
1696,PART VII,
1697,PART VII,"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--"
1698,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump:
1699,PART VII,It is the moss that wholly hides
1700,PART VII,The rotted old oak-stump.
1701,PART VII,
1702,PART VII,"The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,'"
1703,PART VII,"""Why, this is strange, I trow!"
1704,PART VII,"Where are those lights so many and fair,"
1705,PART VII,"That signal made but now?"""
1706,PART VII,
1707,PART VII,"""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said--"
1708,PART VII,"""And they answered not our cheer!"
1709,PART VII,"The planks looked warped! and see those sails,"
1710,PART VII,How thin they are and sere!
1711,PART VII,"I never saw aught like to them,"
1712,PART VII,Unless perchance it were
1713,PART VII,
1714,PART VII,Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
1715,PART VII,My forest-brook along;
1716,PART VII,"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
1717,PART VII,"And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,"
1718,PART VII,"That eats the she-wolf's young."""
1719,PART VII,
1720,PART VII,"""Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look-"
1721,PART VII,(The Pilot made reply)
1722,PART VII,"I am a-feared""--""Push on, push on!"""
1723,PART VII,Said the Hermit cheerily.
1724,PART VII,
1725,PART VII,"The boat came closer to the ship,"
1726,PART VII,But I nor spake nor stirred;
1727,PART VII,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
1728,PART VII,And straight a sound was heard.
1729,PART VII,
1730,PART VII,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
1731,PART VII,Still louder and more dread:
1732,PART VII,"It reached the ship, it split the bay;"
1733,PART VII,The ship went down like lead.
1734,PART VII,
1735,PART VII,"Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,"
1736,PART VII,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
1737,PART VII,Like one that hath been seven days drowned
1738,PART VII,My body lay afloat;
1739,PART VII,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
1740,PART VII,Within the Pilot's boat.
1741,PART VII,
1742,PART VII,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
1743,PART VII,The boat spun round and round;
1744,PART VII,"And all was still, save that the hill"
1745,PART VII,Was telling of the sound.
1746,PART VII,
1747,PART VII,I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked
1748,PART VII,And fell down in a fit;
1749,PART VII,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
1750,PART VII,And prayed where he did sit.
1751,PART VII,
1752,PART VII,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
1753,PART VII,"Who now doth crazy go,"
1754,PART VII,"Laughed loud and long, and all the while"
1755,PART VII,His eyes went to and fro.
1756,PART VII,"""Ha! ha!"" quoth he, ""full plain I see,"
1757,PART VII,"The Devil knows how to row."""
1758,PART VII,
1759,PART VII,"And now, all in my own countree,"
1760,PART VII,I stood on the firm land!
1761,PART VII,"The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,"
1762,PART VII,And scarcely he could stand.
1763,PART VII,
1764,PART VII,"""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"""
1765,PART VII,The Hermit crossed his brow.
1766,PART VII,"""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say"
1767,PART VII,"What manner of man art thou?"""
1768,PART VII,
1769,PART VII,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
1770,PART VII,"With a woful agony,"
1771,PART VII,Which forced me to begin my tale;
1772,PART VII,And then it left me free.
1773,PART VII,
1774,PART VII,"Since then, at an uncertain hour,"
1775,PART VII,That agony returns:
1776,PART VII,"And till my ghastly tale is told,"
1777,PART VII,This heart within me burns.
1778,PART VII,
1779,PART VII,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
1780,PART VII,I have strange power of speech;
1781,PART VII,"That moment that his face I see,"
1782,PART VII,I know the man that must hear me:
1783,PART VII,To him my tale I teach.
1784,PART VII,
1785,PART VII,What loud uproar bursts from that door!
1786,PART VII,The wedding-guests are there:
1787,PART VII,But in the garden-bower the bride
1788,PART VII,And bride-maids singing are:
1789,PART VII,"And hark the little vesper bell,"
1790,PART VII,Which biddeth me to prayer!
1791,PART VII,
1792,PART VII,O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
1793,PART VII,Alone on a wide wide sea:
1794,PART VII,"So lonely 'twas, that God himself"
1795,PART VII,Scarce seemed there to be.
1796,PART VII,
1797,PART VII,"O sweeter than the marriage-feast,"
1798,PART VII,"Tis sweeter far to me,"
1799,PART VII,To walk together to the kirk
1800,PART VII,With a goodly company!--
1801,PART VII,
1802,PART VII,"To walk together to the kirk,"
1803,PART VII,"And all together pray,"
1804,PART VII,"While each to his great Father bends,"
1805,PART VII,"Old men, and babes, and loving friends,"
1806,PART VII,And youths and maidens gay!
1807,PART VII,
1808,PART VII,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell"
1809,PART VII,"To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!"
1810,PART VII,"He prayeth well, who loveth well"
1811,PART VII,Both man and bird and beast.
1812,PART VII,
1813,PART VII,"He prayeth best, who loveth best"
1814,PART VII,All things both great and small;
1815,PART VII,"For the dear God who loveth us,"
1816,PART VII,He made and loveth all.
1817,PART VII,
1818,PART VII,"The Mariner, whose eye is bright,"
1819,PART VII,"Whose beard with age is hoar,"
1820,PART VII,Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest
1821,PART VII,Turned from the bridegroom's door.
1822,PART VII,
1823,PART VII,"He went like one that hath been stunned,"
1824,PART VII,And is of sense forlorn:
1825,PART VII,"A sadder and a wiser man,"
1826,PART VII,He rose the morrow morn.
1827,PART VII,

1851,PART THE FIRST,"Sir Leoline; the Baron rich,"
1852,PART THE FIRST,"Hath a toothless mastiff, which"
1853,PART THE FIRST,From her kennel beneath the rock
1854,PART THE FIRST,"Maketh answer to the clock,"

1858,PART THE FIRST,"Some say, she sees my lady's shroud."
1859,PART THE FIRST,
1860,PART THE FIRST,Is the night chilly and dark?
1861,PART THE FIRST,"The night is chilly, but not dark."
1862,PART THE FIRST,"The thin gray cloud is spread on high,"
1863,PART THE FIRST,It covers but not hides the sky.
1864,PART THE FIRST,"The moon is behind, and at the full;"
1865,PART THE FIRST,And yet she looks both small and dull.
1866,PART THE FIRST,"The night is chill, the cloud is gray:"
1867,PART THE FIRST,"'Tis a month before the month of May,"
1868,PART THE FIRST,And the Spring comes slowly up this way.
1869,PART THE FIRST,
1870,PART THE FIRST,"The lovely lady, Christabel,"
1871,PART THE FIRST,"Whom her father loves so well,"
1872,PART THE FIRST,"What makes her in the wood so late,"
1873,PART THE FIRST,A furlong from the castle gate?
1874,PART THE FIRST,She had dreams all yesternight
1875,PART THE FIRST,Of her own betrothed knight;
1876,PART THE FIRST,And she in the midnight wood will pray
1877,PART THE FIRST,For the weal of her lover that's far away.
1878,PART THE FIRST,
1879,PART THE FIRST,"She stole along, she nothing spoke,"
1880,PART THE FIRST,"The sighs she heaved were soft and low,"
1881,PART THE FIRST,And naught was green upon the oak
1882,PART THE FIRST,But moss and rarest misletoe:
1883,PART THE FIRST,"She kneels beneath the huge oak tree,"
1884,PART THE FIRST,And in silence prayeth she.
1885,PART THE FIRST,
1886,PART THE FIRST,"The lady sprang up suddenly,"
1887,PART THE FIRST,"The lovely lady, Christabel!"
1888,PART THE FIRST,"It moaned as near, as near can be,"
1889,PART THE FIRST,But what it is she cannot tell.--
1890,PART THE FIRST,"On the other side it seems to be,"
1891,PART THE FIRST,"Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree."
1892,PART THE FIRST,
1893,PART THE FIRST,The night is chill; the forest bare;
1894,PART THE FIRST,Is it the wind that moaneth bleak?
1895,PART THE FIRST,There is not wind enough in the air
1896,PART THE FIRST,To move away the ringlet curl
1897,PART THE FIRST,From the lovely lady's cheek--
1898,PART THE FIRST,There is not wind enough to twirl
1899,PART THE FIRST,"The one red leaf, the last of its clan,"
1900,PART THE FIRST,"That dances as often as dance it can,"
1901,PART THE FIRST,"Hanging so light, and hanging so high,"
1902,PART THE FIRST,On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.
1903,PART THE FIRST,
1904,PART THE FIRST,"Hush, beating heart of Christabel!"
1905,PART THE FIRST,"Jesu, Maria, shield her well!"
1906,PART THE FIRST,"She folded her arms beneath her cloak,"
1907,PART THE FIRST,And stole to the other side of the oak.
1908,PART THE FIRST,What sees she there?
1909,PART THE FIRST,
1910,PART THE FIRST,"There she sees a damsel bright,"
1911,PART THE FIRST,"Drest in a silken robe of white,"
1912,PART THE FIRST,That shadowy in the moonlight shone:
1913,PART THE FIRST,"The neck that made that white robe wan,"
1914,PART THE FIRST,"Her stately neck, and arms were bare;"
1915,PART THE FIRST,"Her blue-veined feet unsandal'd were,"
1916,PART THE FIRST,And wildly glittered here and there
1917,PART THE FIRST,The gems entangled in her hair.
1918,PART THE FIRST,"I guess, 'twas frightful there to see"
1919,PART THE FIRST,A lady so richly clad as she--
1920,PART THE FIRST,Beautiful exceedingly!
1921,PART THE FIRST,
1922,PART THE FIRST,"Mary mother, save me now!"
1923,PART THE FIRST,"(Said Christabel,) And who art thou?"
1924,PART THE FIRST,
1925,PART THE FIRST,"The lady strange made answer meet,"
1926,PART THE FIRST,And her voice was faint and sweet:--
1927,PART THE FIRST,"Have pity on my sore distress,"
1928,PART THE FIRST,I scarce can speak for weariness:
1929,PART THE FIRST,"Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!"
1930,PART THE FIRST,"Said Christabel, How camest thou here?"
1931,PART THE FIRST,"And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,"
1932,PART THE FIRST,Did thus pursue her answer meet:--
1933,PART THE FIRST,
1934,PART THE FIRST,"My sire is of a noble line,"
1935,PART THE FIRST,And my name is Geraldine:
1936,PART THE FIRST,"Five warriors seized me yestermorn,"
1937,PART THE FIRST,"Me, even me, a maid forlorn:"
1938,PART THE FIRST,"They choked my cries with force and fright,"
1939,PART THE FIRST,And tied me on a palfrey white.
1940,PART THE FIRST,
1941,PART THE FIRST,"The palfrey was as fleet as wind,"
1942,PART THE FIRST,And they rode furiously behind.
1943,PART THE FIRST,"They spurred amain, their steeds were white:"
1944,PART THE FIRST,And once we crossed the shade of night.
1945,PART THE FIRST,"As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,"
1946,PART THE FIRST,I have no thought what men they be;
1947,PART THE FIRST,Nor do I know how long it is
1948,PART THE FIRST,(For I have lain entranced I wis)
1949,PART THE FIRST,"Since one, the tallest of the five,"
1950,PART THE FIRST,"Took me from the palfrey's back,"
1951,PART THE FIRST,"A weary woman, scarce alive."
1952,PART THE FIRST,Some muttered words his comrades spoke:
1953,PART THE FIRST,He placed me underneath this oak;
1954,PART THE FIRST,He swore they would return with haste;
1955,PART THE FIRST,Whither they went I cannot tell
1956,PART THE FIRST,"I thought I heard, some minutes past,"
1957,PART THE FIRST,Sounds as of a castle bell.
1958,PART THE FIRST,"Stretch forth thy hand (thus ended she),"
1959,PART THE FIRST,And help a wretched maid to flee.
1960,PART THE FIRST,
1961,PART THE FIRST,"Then Christabel stretched forth her hand,"
1962,PART THE FIRST,And comforted fair Geraldine:
1963,PART THE FIRST,"O well, bright dame! may you command"
1964,PART THE FIRST,The service of Sir Leoline;
1965,PART THE FIRST,And gladly our stout chivalry
1966,PART THE FIRST,Will he send forth and friends withal
1967,PART THE FIRST,To guide and guard you safe and free
1968,PART THE FIRST,Home to your noble father's hall.
1969,PART THE FIRST,
1970,PART THE FIRST,She rose: and forth with steps they passed
1971,PART THE FIRST,"That strove to be, and were not, fast."
1972,PART THE FIRST,"Her gracious stars the lady blest,"
1973,PART THE FIRST,And thus spake on sweet Christabel:
1974,PART THE FIRST,"All our household are at rest,"
1975,PART THE FIRST,The hall as silent as the cell;
1976,PART THE FIRST,"Sir Leoline is weak in health,"
1977,PART THE FIRST,"And may not well awakened be,"
1978,PART THE FIRST,"But we will move as if in stealth,"
1979,PART THE FIRST,"And I beseech your courtesy,"
1980,PART THE FIRST,"This night, to share your couch with me."
1981,PART THE FIRST,
1982,PART THE FIRST,"They crossed the moat, and Christabel"
1983,PART THE FIRST,Took the key that fitted well;
1984,PART THE FIRST,"A little door she opened straight,"
1985,PART THE FIRST,All in the middle of the gate;
1986,PART THE FIRST,The gate that was ironed within and without
1987,PART THE FIRST,Where an army in battle array had marched out.
1988,PART THE FIRST,"The lady sank, belike through pain,"
1989,PART THE FIRST,And Christabel with might and main
1990,PART THE FIRST,"Lifted her up, a weary weight,"
1991,PART THE FIRST,Over the threshold of the gate:
1992,PART THE FIRST,"Then the lady rose again,"
1993,PART THE FIRST,"And moved, as she were not in pain."
1994,PART THE FIRST,
1995,PART THE FIRST,"So free from danger, free from fear,"
1996,PART THE FIRST,They crossed the court: right glad they were.
1997,PART THE FIRST,And Christabel devoutly cried
1998,PART THE FIRST,"To the lady by her side,"
1999,PART THE FIRST,Praise we the Virgin all divine
2000,PART THE FIRST,Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!
2001,PART THE FIRST,"Alas! alas! said Geraldine,"
2002,PART THE FIRST,I cannot speak for weariness.
2003,PART THE FIRST,"So free from danger, free from fear,"
2004,PART THE FIRST,They crossed the court: right glad they were.
2005,PART THE FIRST,
2006,PART THE FIRST,"Outside her kennel, the mastiff old"
2007,PART THE FIRST,"Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold."
2008,PART THE FIRST,"The mastiff old did not awake,"
2009,PART THE FIRST,Yet she an angry moan did make!
2010,PART THE FIRST,And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
2011,PART THE FIRST,Never till now she uttered yell
2012,PART THE FIRST,Beneath the eye of Christabel.
2013,PART THE FIRST,Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:
2014,PART THE FIRST,For what can ail the mastiff bitch?
2015,PART THE FIRST,
2016,PART THE FIRST,"They passed the hall, that echoes still,"
2017,PART THE FIRST,Pass as lightly as you will!
2018,PART THE FIRST,"The brands were flat, the brands were dying,"
2019,PART THE FIRST,Amid their own white ashes lying;
2020,PART THE FIRST,"But when the lady passed, there came"
2021,PART THE FIRST,"A tongue of light, a fit of flame"
2022,PART THE FIRST,"And Christabel saw the lady's eye,"
2023,PART THE FIRST,"And nothing else saw she thereby,"
2024,PART THE FIRST,"Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,"
2025,PART THE FIRST,Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.
2026,PART THE FIRST,"O softly tread, said Christabel,"
2027,PART THE FIRST,My father seldom sleepeth well.
2028,PART THE FIRST,
2029,PART THE FIRST,"Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare,"
2030,PART THE FIRST,And jealous of the listening air
2031,PART THE FIRST,"They steal their way from stair to stair,"
2032,PART THE FIRST,"Now in glimmer, and now in gloom,"
2033,PART THE FIRST,"And now they pass the Baron's room,"
2034,PART THE FIRST,As still as death with stifled breath!
2035,PART THE FIRST,And now have reached her chamber door;
2036,PART THE FIRST,And now doth Geraldine press down
2037,PART THE FIRST,The rushes of the chamber floor.
2038,PART THE FIRST,
2039,PART THE FIRST,"The moon shines dim in the open air,"
2040,PART THE FIRST,And not a moonbeam enters here.
2041,PART THE FIRST,But they without its light can see
2042,PART THE FIRST,"The chamber carved so curiously,"
2043,PART THE FIRST,"Carved with figures strange and sweet,"
2044,PART THE FIRST,"All made out of the carver's brain,"
2045,PART THE FIRST,For a lady's chamber meet:
2046,PART THE FIRST,The lamp with twofold silver chain
2047,PART THE FIRST,Is fastened to an angel's feet.
2048,PART THE FIRST,
2049,PART THE FIRST,The silver lamp burns dead and dim;
2050,PART THE FIRST,But Christabel the lamp will trim.
2051,PART THE FIRST,"She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,"
2052,PART THE FIRST,"And left it swinging to and fro,"
2053,PART THE FIRST,"While Geraldine, in wretched plight,"
2054,PART THE FIRST,Sank down upon the floor below.
2055,PART THE FIRST,
2056,PART THE FIRST,"O weary lady, Geraldine,"
2057,PART THE FIRST,"I pray you, drink this cordial wine!"
2058,PART THE FIRST,It is a wine of virtuous powers;
2059,PART THE FIRST,My mother made it of wild flowers.
2060,PART THE FIRST,"And will your mother pity me,"
2061,PART THE FIRST,Who am a maiden most forlorn?
2062,PART THE FIRST,Christabel answered--Woe is me!
2063,PART THE FIRST,She died the hour that I was born.
2064,PART THE FIRST,I have heard the grey-haired friar tell
2065,PART THE FIRST,"How on her death-bed she did say,"
2066,PART THE FIRST,That she should hear the castle-bell
2067,PART THE FIRST,Strike twelve upon my wedding-day.
2068,PART THE FIRST,O mother dear! that thou wert here!
2069,PART THE FIRST,"I would, said Geraldine, she were!"
2070,PART THE FIRST,
2071,PART THE FIRST,"But soon with altered voice, said she--"
2072,PART THE FIRST,"""Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!"
2073,PART THE FIRST,"I have power to bid thee flee."""
2074,PART THE FIRST,Alas! what ails poor Geraldine?
2075,PART THE FIRST,Why stares she with unsettled eye?
2076,PART THE FIRST,Can she the bodiless dead espy?
2077,PART THE FIRST,"And why with hollow voice cries she,"
2078,PART THE FIRST,"""Off, woman, off! this hour is mine--"
2079,PART THE FIRST,"Though thou her guardian spirit be,"
2080,PART THE FIRST,"Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me."""
2081,PART THE FIRST,
2082,PART THE FIRST,"Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,"
2083,PART THE FIRST,"And raised to heaven her eyes so blue--,"
2084,PART THE FIRST,"Alas! said she, this ghastly ride--"
2085,PART THE FIRST,Dear lady! it hath wildered you!
2086,PART THE FIRST,"The lady wiped her moist cold brow,"
2087,PART THE FIRST,"And faintly said, ""'tis over now!"""
2088,PART THE FIRST,Again the wild-flower wine she drank:
2089,PART THE FIRST,"Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,"
2090,PART THE FIRST,"And from the floor whereon she sank,"
2091,PART THE FIRST,The lofty lady stood upright:
2092,PART THE FIRST,"She was most beautiful to see,"
2093,PART THE FIRST,Like a lady of a far countrée.
2094,PART THE FIRST,And thus the lofty lady spake--
2095,PART THE FIRST,"""All they who live in the upper sky,"
2096,PART THE FIRST,"Do love you, holy Christabel!"
2097,PART THE FIRST,"And you love them, and for their sake"
2098,PART THE FIRST,"And for the good which me befel,"
2099,PART THE FIRST,"Even I in my degree will try,"
2100,PART THE FIRST,"Fair maiden, to requite you well."
2101,PART THE FIRST,But now unrobe yourself; for I
2102,PART THE FIRST,"Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie."""
2103,PART THE FIRST,
2104,PART THE FIRST,"Quoth Christabel, So let it be!"
2105,PART THE FIRST,"And as the lady bade, did she."
2106,PART THE FIRST,"Her gentle limbs did she undress,"
2107,PART THE FIRST,And lay down in her loveliness.
2108,PART THE FIRST,
2109,PART THE FIRST,But through her brain of weal and woe
2110,PART THE FIRST,"So many thoughts moved to and fro,"
2111,PART THE FIRST,That vain it were her lids to close;
2112,PART THE FIRST,"So half-way from the bed she rose,"
2113,PART THE FIRST,And on her elbow did recline
2114,PART THE FIRST,To look at the lady Geraldine.
2115,PART THE FIRST,
2116,PART THE FIRST,"Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,"
2117,PART THE FIRST,And slowly rolled her eyes around
2118,PART THE FIRST,"Then drawing in her breath aloud,"
2119,PART THE FIRST,"Like one that shuddered, she unbound"
2120,PART THE FIRST,The cincture from beneath her breast:
2121,PART THE FIRST,"Her silken robe, and inner vest,"
2122,PART THE FIRST,"Dropt to her feet, and full in view,"
2123,PART THE FIRST,Behold! her bosom and half her side------
2124,PART THE FIRST,"A sight to dream of, not to tell!"
2125,PART THE FIRST,O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!
2126,PART THE FIRST,
2127,PART THE FIRST,Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;
2128,PART THE FIRST,Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
2129,PART THE FIRST,Deep from within she seems half-way
2130,PART THE FIRST,"To lift some weight with sick assay,"
2131,PART THE FIRST,And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
2132,PART THE FIRST,"Then suddenly, as one defied,"
2133,PART THE FIRST,"Collects herself in scorn and pride,"
2134,PART THE FIRST,And lay down by the Maiden's side!--
2135,PART THE FIRST,"And in her arms the maid she took,"
2136,PART THE FIRST,Ah wel-a-day!
2137,PART THE FIRST,And with low voice and doleful look
2138,PART THE FIRST,These words did say:
2139,PART THE FIRST,"In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,"
2140,PART THE FIRST,"Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!"
2141,PART THE FIRST,"Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,"
2142,PART THE FIRST,"This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;"
2143,PART THE FIRST,"But vainly thou warrest,"
2144,PART THE FIRST,For his is alone in
2145,PART THE FIRST,"Thy power to declare,"
2146,PART THE FIRST,That in the dim forest
2147,PART THE FIRST,"Thou heard'st a low moaning,"
2148,PART THE FIRST,"And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair;"
2149,PART THE FIRST,And didst bring her home with thee in love and
2150,PART THE FIRST,"in charity,"
2151,PART THE FIRST,To shield her and shelter her from the damp
2152,PART THE FIRST,"air."""

2155,THE CONCLUSION,THE CONCLUSION
2156,TO PART THE FIRST,TO PART THE FIRST
2157,TO PART THE FIRST,
2158,TO PART THE FIRST,
2159,TO PART THE FIRST,It was a lovely sight to see
2160,TO PART THE FIRST,"The lady Christabel, when she"
2161,TO PART THE FIRST,Was praying at the old oak tree.
2162,TO PART THE FIRST,Amid the jagged shadows
2163,TO PART THE FIRST,"Of mossy leafless boughs,"
2164,TO PART THE FIRST,"Kneeling in the moonlight,"
2165,TO PART THE FIRST,To make her gentle vows;
2166,TO PART THE FIRST,"Her slender palms together prest,"
2167,TO PART THE FIRST,Heaving sometimes on her breast;
2168,TO PART THE FIRST,Her face resigned to bliss or bale--
2169,TO PART THE FIRST,"Her face, oh call it fair not pale,"
2170,TO PART THE FIRST,"And both blue eyes more, bright than clear,"
2171,TO PART THE FIRST,Each about to have a tear.
2172,TO PART THE FIRST,
2173,TO PART THE FIRST,With open eyes (ah woe is me!)
2174,TO PART THE FIRST,"Asleep, and dreaming fearfully,"
2175,TO PART THE FIRST,"Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,."
2176,TO PART THE FIRST,"Dreaming that alone, which is--"
2177,TO PART THE FIRST,"O sorrow and shame! Can this be she,"
2178,TO PART THE FIRST,"The lady, who knelt at the old oak tree?"
2179,TO PART THE FIRST,"And lo! the worker of these harms,"
2180,TO PART THE FIRST,"That holds the maiden in her arms,"
2181,TO PART THE FIRST,"Seems to slumber still and mild,"
2182,TO PART THE FIRST,As a mother with her child.
2183,TO PART THE FIRST,
2184,TO PART THE FIRST,"A star hath set, a star hath risen,"
2185,TO PART THE FIRST,O Geraldine! since arms of thine
2186,TO PART THE FIRST,Have been the lovely lady's prison.
2187,TO PART THE FIRST,O Geraldine! one hour was thine
2188,TO PART THE FIRST,"Thou'st had thy will! By tairn and rill,"
2189,TO PART THE FIRST,The night-birds all that hour were still.
2190,TO PART THE FIRST,"But now they are jubilant anew,"
2191,TO PART THE FIRST,"From cliff and tower, tu-whoo! tu-whoo!"
2192,TO PART THE FIRST,Tu-whoo! tu-whoo! from wood and fell!
2193,TO PART THE FIRST,
2194,TO PART THE FIRST,And see! the lady Christabel
2195,TO PART THE FIRST,Gathers herself from out her trance;
2196,TO PART THE FIRST,"Her limbs relax, her countenance"
2197,TO PART THE FIRST,Grows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids
2198,TO PART THE FIRST,Close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds
2199,TO PART THE FIRST,Large tears that leave the lashes bright!
2200,TO PART THE FIRST,And oft the while she seems to smile
2201,TO PART THE FIRST,As infants at a sudden light!
2202,TO PART THE FIRST,
2203,TO PART THE FIRST,"Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep,"
2204,TO PART THE FIRST,"Like a youthful hermitess,"
2205,TO PART THE FIRST,"Beauteous in a wilderness,"
2206,TO PART THE FIRST,"Who, praying always, prays in sleep."
2207,TO PART THE FIRST,"And, if she move unquietly,"
2208,TO PART THE FIRST,"Perchance,'tis but the blood so free"
2209,TO PART THE FIRST,Comes back and tingles in her feet.
2210,TO PART THE FIRST,"No doubt, she hath a vision sweet."
2211,TO PART THE FIRST,"What if her guardian spirit 'twere,"
2212,TO PART THE FIRST,What if she knew her mother near?
2213,TO PART THE FIRST,"But this she knows, in joys and woes,"
2214,TO PART THE FIRST,That saints will aid if men will call:
2215,TO PART THE FIRST,For the blue sky bends over all!
2216,TO PART THE FIRST,
2217,TO PART THE FIRST,1797.

2221,PART THE SECOND,
2222,PART THE SECOND,
2223,PART THE SECOND,"Each matin bell, the Baron saith,"
2224,PART THE SECOND,Knells us back to a world of death.
2225,PART THE SECOND,"These words Sir Leoline first said,"
2226,PART THE SECOND,When he rose and found his lady dead:
2227,PART THE SECOND,These words Sir Leoline will say
2228,PART THE SECOND,Many a morn to his dying day!
2229,PART THE SECOND,
2230,PART THE SECOND,And hence the custom and law began
2231,PART THE SECOND,"That still at dawn the sacristan,"
2232,PART THE SECOND,"Who duly pulls the heavy bell,"
2233,PART THE SECOND,Five and forty beads must tell
2234,PART THE SECOND,"Between each stroke--a warning knell,"
2235,PART THE SECOND,Which not a soul can choose but hear
2236,PART THE SECOND,From Bratha Head to Wyndermere.
2237,PART THE SECOND,"Saith Bracy the bard, So let it knell!"
2238,PART THE SECOND,And let the drowsy sacristan
2239,PART THE SECOND,Still count as slowly as he can!
2240,PART THE SECOND,"There is no lack of such, I ween,"
2241,PART THE SECOND,As well fill up the space between.
2242,PART THE SECOND,"In Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair,"
2243,PART THE SECOND,"And Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent,"
2244,PART THE SECOND,With ropes of rock and bells of air
2245,PART THE SECOND,"Three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent,"
2246,PART THE SECOND,"Who all give back, one after t'other,"
2247,PART THE SECOND,The death-note to their living brother;
2248,PART THE SECOND,"And oft too, by the knell offended,"
2249,PART THE SECOND,"Just as their one! two! three! is ended,"
2250,PART THE SECOND,The devil mocks the doleful tale
2251,PART THE SECOND,With a merry peal from Borrowdale.
2252,PART THE SECOND,
2253,PART THE SECOND,The air is still! through mist and cloud
2254,PART THE SECOND,That merry peal comes ringing loud;
2255,PART THE SECOND,"And Geraldine shakes off her dread,"
2256,PART THE SECOND,And rises lightly from the bed;
2257,PART THE SECOND,"Puts on her silken vestments white,"
2258,PART THE SECOND,"And tricks her hair in lovely plight,"
2259,PART THE SECOND,And nothing doubting of her spell
2260,PART THE SECOND,Awakens the lady Christabel
2261,PART THE SECOND,"""Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel?"
2262,PART THE SECOND,"I trust that you have rested well."""
2263,PART THE SECOND,
2264,PART THE SECOND,And Christabel awoke and spied
2265,PART THE SECOND,The same who lay down by her side--
2266,PART THE SECOND,"O rather say, the same whom she"
2267,PART THE SECOND,Raised up beneath the old oak tree!
2268,PART THE SECOND,"Nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair!"
2269,PART THE SECOND,For she belike hath drunken deep
2270,PART THE SECOND,Of all the blessedness of sleep!
2271,PART THE SECOND,"And while she spake, her looks, her air,"
2272,PART THE SECOND,"Such gentle thankfulness declare,"
2273,PART THE SECOND,That (so it seemed) her girded vests
2274,PART THE SECOND,Grew tight beneath her heaving breasts.
2275,PART THE SECOND,"""Sure I have sinn'd!"" said Christabel,"
2276,PART THE SECOND,"""Now heaven be praised if all be well!"""
2277,PART THE SECOND,"And in low faltering tones, yet sweet,"
2278,PART THE SECOND,Did she the lofty lady greet
2279,PART THE SECOND,With such perplexity of mind
2280,PART THE SECOND,As dreams too lively leave behind.
2281,PART THE SECOND,
2282,PART THE SECOND,"So quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed"
2283,PART THE SECOND,"Her maiden limbs, and having prayed"
2284,PART THE SECOND,"That He, who on the cross did groan,"
2285,PART THE SECOND,"Might wash away her sins unknown,"
2286,PART THE SECOND,She forthwith led fair Geraldine
2287,PART THE SECOND,"To meet her sire, Sir Leoline."
2288,PART THE SECOND,
2289,PART THE SECOND,The lovely maid and the lady tall
2290,PART THE SECOND,"Are pacing both into the hall,"
2291,PART THE SECOND,"And pacing on through page and groom,"
2292,PART THE SECOND,Enter the Baron's presence-room.
2293,PART THE SECOND,
2294,PART THE SECOND,"The Baron rose, and while he prest"
2295,PART THE SECOND,"His gentle daughter to his breast,"
2296,PART THE SECOND,With cheerful wonder in his eyes
2297,PART THE SECOND,"The lady Geraldine espies,"
2298,PART THE SECOND,"And gave such welcome to the same,"
2299,PART THE SECOND,As might beseem so bright a dame!
2300,PART THE SECOND,
2301,PART THE SECOND,"But when he heard the lady's tale,"
2302,PART THE SECOND,"And when she told her father's name,"
2303,PART THE SECOND,"Why waxed Sir Leoline so pale,"
2304,PART THE SECOND,"Murmuring o'er the name again,"
2305,PART THE SECOND,Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?
2306,PART THE SECOND,
2307,PART THE SECOND,Alas! they had been friends in youth;
2308,PART THE SECOND,But whispering tongues can poison truth;
2309,PART THE SECOND,And constancy lives in realms above;
2310,PART THE SECOND,And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
2311,PART THE SECOND,And to be wroth with one we love
2312,PART THE SECOND,Doth work like madness in the brain.
2313,PART THE SECOND,"And thus it chanced, as I divine,"
2314,PART THE SECOND,With Roland and Sir Leoline.
2315,PART THE SECOND,Each spake words of high disdain
2316,PART THE SECOND,And insult to his heart's best brother:
2317,PART THE SECOND,They parted--ne'er to meet again!
2318,PART THE SECOND,But never either found another
2319,PART THE SECOND,To free the hollow heart from paining--
2320,PART THE SECOND,"They stood aloof, the scars remaining,"
2321,PART THE SECOND,Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
2322,PART THE SECOND,A dreary sea now flows between.
2323,PART THE SECOND,"But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,"
2324,PART THE SECOND,"Shall wholly do away, I ween,"
2325,PART THE SECOND,The marks of that which once hath been.
2326,PART THE SECOND,"Sir Leoline, a moment's space,"
2327,PART THE SECOND,Stood gazing on the damsel's face:
2328,PART THE SECOND,And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine
2329,PART THE SECOND,Came back upon his heart again.
2330,PART THE SECOND,
2331,PART THE SECOND,"O then the Baron forgot his age,"
2332,PART THE SECOND,His noble heart swelled high with rage;
2333,PART THE SECOND,He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side
2334,PART THE SECOND,"He would proclaim it far and wide,"
2335,PART THE SECOND,"With trump and solemn heraldry,"
2336,PART THE SECOND,"That they, who thus had wronged the dame"
2337,PART THE SECOND,Were base as spotted infamy!
2338,PART THE SECOND,"""And if they dare deny the same,"
2339,PART THE SECOND,"My herald shall appoint a week,"
2340,PART THE SECOND,And let the recreant traitors seek
2341,PART THE SECOND,My tourney court--that there and then
2342,PART THE SECOND,I may dislodge their reptile souls
2343,PART THE SECOND,"From the bodies and forms of men!"""
2344,PART THE SECOND,He spake: his eye in lightning rolls!
2345,PART THE SECOND,For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned
2346,PART THE SECOND,In the beautiful lady the child of his friend!
2347,PART THE SECOND,
2348,PART THE SECOND,"And now the tears were on his face,"
2349,PART THE SECOND,And fondly in his arms he took
2350,PART THE SECOND,"Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace,"
2351,PART THE SECOND,Prolonging it with joyous look.
2352,PART THE SECOND,"Which when she viewed, a vision fell"
2353,PART THE SECOND,"Upon the soul of Christabel,"
2354,PART THE SECOND,
2355,PART THE SECOND,"The vision of fear, the touch and pain!"
2356,PART THE SECOND,"She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again--"
2357,PART THE SECOND,"(Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,"
2358,PART THE SECOND,Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?)
2359,PART THE SECOND,
2360,PART THE SECOND,"Again she saw that bosom old,"
2361,PART THE SECOND,"Again she felt that bosom cold,"
2362,PART THE SECOND,And drew in her breath with a hissing sound:
2363,PART THE SECOND,"Whereat the Knight turned wildly round,"
2364,PART THE SECOND,"And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid"
2365,PART THE SECOND,"With eyes upraised, as one that prayed."
2366,PART THE SECOND,
2367,PART THE SECOND,"The touch, the sight, had passed away,"
2368,PART THE SECOND,"And in its stead that vision blest,"
2369,PART THE SECOND,"Which comforted her after-rest,"
2370,PART THE SECOND,"While in the lady's arms she lay,"
2371,PART THE SECOND,"Had put a rapture in her breast,"
2372,PART THE SECOND,And on her lips and o'er her eyes
2373,PART THE SECOND,Spread smiles like light!
2374,PART THE SECOND,
2375,PART THE SECOND,"With new surprise,"
2376,PART THE SECOND,"""What ails then my beloved child?"""
2377,PART THE SECOND,The Baron said--His daughter mild
2378,PART THE SECOND,"Made answer, ""All will yet be well!"""
2379,PART THE SECOND,"I ween, she had no power to tell"
2380,PART THE SECOND,Aught else: so mighty was the spell.
2381,PART THE SECOND,"Yet he, who saw this Geraldine,"
2382,PART THE SECOND,Had deemed her sure a thing divine.
2383,PART THE SECOND,"Such sorrow with such grace she blended,"
2384,PART THE SECOND,As if she feared she had offended
2385,PART THE SECOND,
2386,PART THE SECOND,"Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid!"
2387,PART THE SECOND,And with such lowly tones she prayed
2388,PART THE SECOND,She might be sent without delay
2389,PART THE SECOND,Home to her father's mansion.
2390,PART THE SECOND,
2391,PART THE SECOND,"""Nay!"
2392,PART THE SECOND,"Nay, by my soul!"" said Leoline."
2393,PART THE SECOND,"""Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!"
2394,PART THE SECOND,"Go thou, with music sweet and loud,"
2395,PART THE SECOND,"And take two steeds with trappings proud,"
2396,PART THE SECOND,And take the youth whom thou lov'st best
2397,PART THE SECOND,"To bear thy harp, and learn thy song,"
2398,PART THE SECOND,"And clothe you both in solemn vest,"
2399,PART THE SECOND,"And over the mountains haste along,"
2400,PART THE SECOND,"Lest wandering folk, that are abroad,"
2401,PART THE SECOND,Detain you on the valley road.
2402,PART THE SECOND,
2403,PART THE SECOND,"""And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,"
2404,PART THE SECOND,"My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes"
2405,PART THE SECOND,"Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,"
2406,PART THE SECOND,And reaches soon that castle good
2407,PART THE SECOND,Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.
2408,PART THE SECOND,
2409,PART THE SECOND,"""Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,"
2410,PART THE SECOND,"Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,"
2411,PART THE SECOND,More loud than your horses' echoing feet!
2412,PART THE SECOND,"And loud and loud to Lord Roland call,"
2413,PART THE SECOND,Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!
2414,PART THE SECOND,Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free--
2415,PART THE SECOND,Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me.
2416,PART THE SECOND,
2417,PART THE SECOND,He bids thee come without delay
2418,PART THE SECOND,With all thy numerous array;
2419,PART THE SECOND,And take thy lovely daughter home:
2420,PART THE SECOND,And he will meet thee on the way
2421,PART THE SECOND,With all his numerous array
2422,PART THE SECOND,White with their panting palfreys' foam:
2423,PART THE SECOND,"And, by mine honour! I will say,"
2424,PART THE SECOND,That I repent me of the day
2425,PART THE SECOND,When I spake words of fierce disdain
2426,PART THE SECOND,To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!--
2427,PART THE SECOND,"--For since that evil hour hath flown,"
2428,PART THE SECOND,Many a summer's sun hath shone;
2429,PART THE SECOND,Yet ne'er found I a friend again
2430,PART THE SECOND,"Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine."""
2431,PART THE SECOND,
2432,PART THE SECOND,"The lady fell, and clasped his knees,"
2433,PART THE SECOND,"Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;"
2434,PART THE SECOND,"And Bracy replied, with faltering voice,"
2435,PART THE SECOND,His gracious hail on all bestowing;
2436,PART THE SECOND,"""Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,"
2437,PART THE SECOND,Are sweeter than my harp can tell;
2438,PART THE SECOND,"Yet might I gain a boon of thee,"
2439,PART THE SECOND,"This day my journey should not be,"
2440,PART THE SECOND,So strange a dream hath come to me;
2441,PART THE SECOND,That I had vowed with music loud
2442,PART THE SECOND,"To clear yon wood from thing unblest,"
2443,PART THE SECOND,Warn'd by a vision in my rest!
2444,PART THE SECOND,"For in my sleep I saw that dove,"
2445,PART THE SECOND,"That gentle bird, whom thou dost love,"
2446,PART THE SECOND,And call'st by thy own daughter's name--
2447,PART THE SECOND,"Sir Leoline! I saw the same,"
2448,PART THE SECOND,"Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan,"
2449,PART THE SECOND,Among the green herbs in the forest alone.
2450,PART THE SECOND,"Which when I saw and when I heard,"
2451,PART THE SECOND,I wonder'd what might ail the bird;
2452,PART THE SECOND,"For nothing near it could I see,"
2453,PART THE SECOND,Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.
2454,PART THE SECOND,
2455,PART THE SECOND,"""And in my dream, methought, I went"
2456,PART THE SECOND,To search out what might there be found;
2457,PART THE SECOND,"And what the sweet bird's trouble meant,"
2458,PART THE SECOND,That thus lay fluttering on the ground.
2459,PART THE SECOND,"I went and peered, and could descry"
2460,PART THE SECOND,No cause for her distressful cry;
2461,PART THE SECOND,But yet for her dear lady's sake
2462,PART THE SECOND,"I stooped, methought, the dove to take,"
2463,PART THE SECOND,When lo! I saw a bright green snake
2464,PART THE SECOND,Coiled around its wings and neck.
2465,PART THE SECOND,"Green as the herbs on which it couched,"
2466,PART THE SECOND,Close by the dove's its head it crouched;
2467,PART THE SECOND,"And with the dove it heaves and stirs,"
2468,PART THE SECOND,Swelling its neck as she swelled hers!
2469,PART THE SECOND,"I woke; it was the midnight hour,"
2470,PART THE SECOND,The clock was echoing in the tower;
2471,PART THE SECOND,"But though my slumber was gone by,"
2472,PART THE SECOND,This dream it would not pass away--
2473,PART THE SECOND,It seems to live upon my eye!
2474,PART THE SECOND,And thence I vowed this self-same day
2475,PART THE SECOND,With music strong and saintly song
2476,PART THE SECOND,"To wander through the forest bare,"
2477,PART THE SECOND,"Lest aught unholy loiter there."""
2478,PART THE SECOND,
2479,PART THE SECOND,"Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,"
2480,PART THE SECOND,Half-listening heard him with a smile;
2481,PART THE SECOND,"Then turned to Lady Geraldine,"

2483,PART THE SECOND,"And said in courtly accents fine,"

2485,PART THE SECOND,"With arms more strong than harp or song,"
2486,PART THE SECOND,"Thy sire and I will crush the snake!"""
2487,PART THE SECOND,"He kissed her forehead as he spake,"
2488,PART THE SECOND,And Geraldine in maiden wise
2489,PART THE SECOND,"Casting down her large bright eyes,"
2490,PART THE SECOND,With blushing cheek and courtesy fine
2491,PART THE SECOND,She turned her from Sir Leoline;
2492,PART THE SECOND,"Softly gathering up her train,"
2493,PART THE SECOND,That o'er her right arm fell again;
2494,PART THE SECOND,"And folded her arms across her chest,"
2495,PART THE SECOND,"And couched her head upon her breast,"
2496,PART THE SECOND,And looked askance at Christabel--
2497,PART THE SECOND,"Jesu, Maria, shield her well!"
2498,PART THE SECOND,
2499,PART THE SECOND,"A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy,"
2500,PART THE SECOND,"And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,"
2501,PART THE SECOND,"Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye,"
2502,PART THE SECOND,"And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,"
2503,PART THE SECOND,At Christabel she look'd askance!--
2504,PART THE SECOND,One moment--and the sight was fled!
2505,PART THE SECOND,But Christabel in dizzy trance
2506,PART THE SECOND,Stumbling on the unsteady ground
2507,PART THE SECOND,"Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;"
2508,PART THE SECOND,"And Geraldine again turned round,"
2509,PART THE SECOND,"And like a thing, that sought relief,"
2510,PART THE SECOND,"Full of wonder and full of grief,"
2511,PART THE SECOND,She rolled her large bright eyes divine
2512,PART THE SECOND,Wildly on Sir Leoline.
2513,PART THE SECOND,
2514,PART THE SECOND,"The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,"
2515,PART THE SECOND,She nothing sees--no sight but one!
2516,PART THE SECOND,"The maid, devoid of guile and sin,"
2517,PART THE SECOND,"I know not how, in fearful wise,"
2518,PART THE SECOND,So deeply had she drunken in
2519,PART THE SECOND,"That look, those shrunken serpent eyes,"
2520,PART THE SECOND,That all her features were resigned
2521,PART THE SECOND,To this sole image in her mind:
2522,PART THE SECOND,And passively did imitate
2523,PART THE SECOND,That look of dull and treacherous hate!
2524,PART THE SECOND,"And thus she stood, in dizzy trance,"
2525,PART THE SECOND,Still picturing that look askance
2526,PART THE SECOND,With forced unconscious sympathy
2527,PART THE SECOND,Full before her father's view--
2528,PART THE SECOND,As far as such a look could be
2529,PART THE SECOND,In eyes so innocent and blue!
2530,PART THE SECOND,
2531,PART THE SECOND,"And when the trance was o'er, the maid"
2532,PART THE SECOND,"Paused awhile, and inly prayed:"
2533,PART THE SECOND,"Then falling at the Baron's feet,"
2534,PART THE SECOND,"""By my mother's soul do I entreat"
2535,PART THE SECOND,"That thou this woman send away!"""
2536,PART THE SECOND,She said: and more she could not say:
2537,PART THE SECOND,"For what she knew she could not tell,"
2538,PART THE SECOND,O'er-mastered by the mighty spell.
2539,PART THE SECOND,
2540,PART THE SECOND,"Why is thy cheek so wan and wild,"
2541,PART THE SECOND,Sir Leoline? Thy only child
2542,PART THE SECOND,"Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,"
2543,PART THE SECOND,"So fair, so innocent, so mild;"
2544,PART THE SECOND,"The same, for whom thy lady died!"
2545,PART THE SECOND,"O, by the pangs of her dear mother"
2546,PART THE SECOND,Think thou no evil of thy child!
2547,PART THE SECOND,"For her, and thee, and for no other,"
2548,PART THE SECOND,She prayed the moment ere she died:
2549,PART THE SECOND,"Prayed that the babe for whom she died,"
2550,PART THE SECOND,Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!
2551,PART THE SECOND,"That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,"
2552,PART THE SECOND,Sir Leoline!
2553,PART THE SECOND,"And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,"
2554,PART THE SECOND,Her child and thine?
2555,PART THE SECOND,
2556,PART THE SECOND,Within the Baron's heart and brain
2557,PART THE SECOND,"If thoughts, like these, had any share,"
2558,PART THE SECOND,"They only swelled his rage and pain,"
2559,PART THE SECOND,And did but work confusion there.
2560,PART THE SECOND,"His heart was cleft with pain and rage,"
2561,PART THE SECOND,"His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,"
2562,PART THE SECOND,Dishonour'd thus in his old age;
2563,PART THE SECOND,"Dishonour'd by his only child,"
2564,PART THE SECOND,And all his hospitality
2565,PART THE SECOND,To the insulted daughter of his friend
2566,PART THE SECOND,By more than woman's jealousy
2567,PART THE SECOND,Brought thus to a disgraceful end--
2568,PART THE SECOND,He rolled his eye with stern regard
2569,PART THE SECOND,"Upon the gentle minstrel bard,"
2570,PART THE SECOND,"And said in tones abrupt, austere--"
2571,PART THE SECOND,"""Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?"
2572,PART THE SECOND,"I bade thee hence!"" The bard obeyed;"
2573,PART THE SECOND,"And turning from his own sweet maid,"
2574,PART THE SECOND,"The aged knight, Sir Leoline,"
2575,PART THE SECOND,Led forth the lady Geraldine!

2614,KUBLA KHAN,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
2615,KUBLA KHAN,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
2616,KUBLA KHAN,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
2617,KUBLA KHAN,Through caverns measureless to man
2618,KUBLA KHAN,Down to a sunless sea.
2619,KUBLA KHAN,So twice five miles of fertile ground
2620,KUBLA KHAN,With walls and towers were girdled round:
2621,KUBLA KHAN,"And here were gardens bright with sinuous rills,"
2622,KUBLA KHAN,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
2623,KUBLA KHAN,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
2624,KUBLA KHAN,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
2625,KUBLA KHAN,
2626,KUBLA KHAN,But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
2627,KUBLA KHAN,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
2628,KUBLA KHAN,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
2629,KUBLA KHAN,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
2630,KUBLA KHAN,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
2631,KUBLA KHAN,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,"
2632,KUBLA KHAN,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
2633,KUBLA KHAN,A mighty fountain momently was forced:
2634,KUBLA KHAN,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
2635,KUBLA KHAN,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
2636,KUBLA KHAN,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
2637,KUBLA KHAN,And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
2638,KUBLA KHAN,It flung up momently the sacred river.
2639,KUBLA KHAN,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
2640,KUBLA KHAN,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
2641,KUBLA KHAN,"Then reached the caverns measureless to man,"
2642,KUBLA KHAN,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
2643,KUBLA KHAN,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
2644,KUBLA KHAN,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
2645,KUBLA KHAN,
2646,KUBLA KHAN,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
2647,KUBLA KHAN,Floated midway on the waves;
2648,KUBLA KHAN,Where was heard the mingled measure
2649,KUBLA KHAN,From the fountain and the caves.
2650,KUBLA KHAN,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
2651,KUBLA KHAN,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

2653,KUBLA KHAN,A damsel with a dulcimer
2654,KUBLA KHAN,In a vision once I saw:
2655,KUBLA KHAN,It was an Abyssinian maid;
2656,KUBLA KHAN,"And on her dulcimer she played,"
2657,KUBLA KHAN,Singing of Mount Abora.
2658,KUBLA KHAN,Could I revive within me
2659,KUBLA KHAN,"Her symphony and song,"
2660,KUBLA KHAN,"To such a deep delight 'twould win me,"
2661,KUBLA KHAN,"That with music loud and long,"
2662,KUBLA KHAN,"I would build that dome in air,"
2663,KUBLA KHAN,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
2664,KUBLA KHAN,"And all who heard should see them there,"
2665,KUBLA KHAN,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
2666,KUBLA KHAN,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
2667,KUBLA KHAN,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
2668,KUBLA KHAN,"And close your eyes with holy dread,"
2669,KUBLA KHAN,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"
2670,KUBLA KHAN,And drunk the milk of Paradise.

2874,LOVE,Beside the ruined tower.
2875,LOVE,
2876,LOVE,"The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene"
2877,LOVE,Had blended with the lights of eve;
2878,LOVE,"And she was there, my hope, my joy,"
2879,LOVE,My own dear Genevieve!
2880,LOVE,
2881,LOVE,"She leant against the armed man,"
2882,LOVE,The statue of the armed knight;
2883,LOVE,"She stood and listened to my lay,"
2884,LOVE,Amid the lingering light.
2885,LOVE,
2886,LOVE,Few sorrows hath she of her own.
2887,LOVE,My hope! my joy! my Genevieve!
2888,LOVE,"She loves me best, whene'er I sing"
2889,LOVE,The songs that make her grieve.
2890,LOVE,
2891,LOVE,"I played a soft and doleful air,"
2892,LOVE,I sang an old and moving story--
2893,LOVE,"An old rude song, that suited well"
2894,LOVE,That ruin wild and hoary.
2895,LOVE,
2896,LOVE,"She listened with a flitting blush,"
2897,LOVE,With downcast eyes and modest grace;
2898,LOVE,"For well she knew, I could not choose"
2899,LOVE,But gaze upon her face.
2900,LOVE,
2901,LOVE,I told her of the Knight that wore
2902,LOVE,Upon his shield a burning brand;
2903,LOVE,And that for ten long years he wooed
2904,LOVE,The Lady of the Land.
2905,LOVE,
2906,LOVE,I told her how he pined: and ah!
2907,LOVE,"The deep, the low, the pleading tone"
2908,LOVE,"With which I sang another's love,"
2909,LOVE,Interpreted my own.
2910,LOVE,
2911,LOVE,"She listened with a flitting blush,"
2912,LOVE,"With downcast eyes, and modest grace;"
2913,LOVE,"And she forgave me, that I gazed"
2914,LOVE,Too fondly on her face!
2915,LOVE,
2916,LOVE,But when I told the cruel scorn
2917,LOVE,"That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,"
2918,LOVE,"And that he crossed the mountain-woods,"
2919,LOVE,Nor rested day nor night;
2920,LOVE,
2921,LOVE,"That sometimes from the savage den,"
2922,LOVE,"And sometimes from the darksome shade,"
2923,LOVE,And sometimes starting up at once
2924,LOVE,"In green and sunny glade,--"
2925,LOVE,
2926,LOVE,There came and looked him in the face
2927,LOVE,An angel beautiful and bright;
2928,LOVE,"And that he knew it was a Fiend,"
2929,LOVE,This miserable Knight!
2930,LOVE,
2931,LOVE,"And that unknowing what he did,"
2932,LOVE,"He leaped amid a murderous band,"
2933,LOVE,And saved from outrage worse than death
2934,LOVE,The Lady of the Land!
2935,LOVE,
2936,LOVE,"And how she wept, and clasped his knees;"
2937,LOVE,And how she tended him in vain--
2938,LOVE,And ever strove to expiate
2939,LOVE,The scorn that crazed his brain;--
2940,LOVE,
2941,LOVE,And that she nursed him in a cave;
2942,LOVE,"And how his madness went away,"
2943,LOVE,When on the yellow forest-leaves
2944,LOVE,A dying man he lay;--
2945,LOVE,
2946,LOVE,His dying words-but when I reached
2947,LOVE,"That tenderest strain of all the ditty,"
2948,LOVE,My faltering voice and pausing harp
2949,LOVE,Disturbed her soul with pity!
2950,LOVE,
2951,LOVE,All impulses of soul and sense
2952,LOVE,Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve;
2953,LOVE,"The music and the doleful tale,"
2954,LOVE,The rich and balmy eve;
2955,LOVE,
2956,LOVE,"And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,"
2957,LOVE,"An undistinguishable throng,"
2958,LOVE,"And gentle wishes long subdued,"
2959,LOVE,Subdued and cherished long!
2960,LOVE,
2961,LOVE,"She wept with pity and delight,"
2962,LOVE,"She blushed with love, and virgin-shame;"
2963,LOVE,"And like the murmur of a dream,"
2964,LOVE,I heard her breathe my name.
2965,LOVE,
2966,LOVE,"Her bosom heaved--she stepped aside,"
2967,LOVE,As conscious of my look she stepped--
2968,LOVE,"Then suddenly, with timorous eye"
2969,LOVE,She fled to me and wept.
2970,LOVE,
2971,LOVE,"She half enclosed me with her arms,"
2972,LOVE,She pressed me with a meek embrace;
2973,LOVE,"And bending back her head, looked up,"
2974,LOVE,And gazed upon my face.
2975,LOVE,
2976,LOVE,"'Twas partly love, and partly fear,"
2977,LOVE,"And partly 'twas a bashful art,"
2978,LOVE,"That I might rather feel, than see,"
2979,LOVE,The swelling of her heart.
2980,LOVE,
2981,LOVE,"I calmed her fears, and she was calm,"
2982,LOVE,And told her love with virgin pride;
2983,LOVE,"And so I won my Genevieve,"
2984,LOVE,My bright and beauteous Bride.
2985,LOVE,
2986,LOVE,1798-1799.

2993,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE
2994,PART I,PART I
2995,PART I,
2996,PART I,
2997,PART I,The grapes upon the Vicar's wall
2998,PART I,Were ripe as ripe could be;
2999,PART I,And yellow leaves in sun and wind
3000,PART I,Were falling from the tree.
3001,PART I,
3002,PART I,On the hedge-elms in the narrow lane
3003,PART I,Still swung the spikes of corn:
3004,PART I,Dear Lord! it seems but yesterday--
3005,PART I,Young Edward's marriage-morn.
3006,PART I,
3007,PART I,"Up through that wood behind the church,"
3008,PART I,There leads from Edward's door
3009,PART I,"A mossy track, all over boughed,"
3010,PART I,For half a mile or more.
3011,PART I,
3012,PART I,And from their house-door by that track
3013,PART I,The bride and bridegroom went;
3014,PART I,"Sweet Mary, though she was not gay,"
3015,PART I,Seemed cheerful and content.
3016,PART I,
3017,PART I,"But when they to the church-yard came,"
3018,PART I,"I've heard poor Mary say,"
3019,PART I,"As soon as she stepped into the sun,"
3020,PART I,Her heart it died away.
3021,PART I,
3022,PART I,"And when the Vicar join'd their hands,"
3023,PART I,Her limbs did creep and freeze;
3024,PART I,"But when they prayed, she thought she saw"
3025,PART I,Her mother on her knees.
3026,PART I,
3027,PART I,And o'er the church-path they returned--
3028,PART I,"I saw poor Mary's back,"
3029,PART I,Just as she stepped beneath the boughs
3030,PART I,Into the mossy track.
3031,PART I,
3032,PART I,Her feet upon the mossy track
3033,PART I,The married maiden set:
3034,PART I,That moment--I have heard her say--
3035,PART I,She wished she could forget.
3036,PART I,
3037,PART I,The shade o'er-flushed her limbs with heat--
3038,PART I,Then came a chill like death:
3039,PART I,"And when the merry bells rang out,"
3040,PART I,They seemed to stop her breath.
3041,PART I,
3042,PART I,Beneath the foulest mother's curse
3043,PART I,No child could ever thrive:
3044,PART I,"A mother is a mother still,"
3045,PART I,The holiest thing alive.
3046,PART I,
3047,PART I,So five months passed: the mother still
3048,PART I,Would never heal the strife;
3049,PART I,"But Edward was a loving man,"
3050,PART I,And Mary a fond wife.
3051,PART I,
3052,PART I,"""My sister may not visit us,"
3053,PART I,My mother says her nay:
3054,PART I,"O Edward! you are all to me,"
3055,PART I,I wish for your sake I could be
3056,PART I,More lifesome and more gay.
3057,PART I,
3058,PART I,"""I'm dull and sad! indeed, indeed"
3059,PART I,I know I have no reason!
3060,PART I,"Perhaps I am not well in health,"
3061,PART I,"And 'tis a gloomy season."""
3062,PART I,
3063,PART I,"'Twas a drizzly time--no ice, no snow!"
3064,PART I,And on the few fine days
3065,PART I,"She stirred not out, lest she might meet"
3066,PART I,Her mother in the ways.
3067,PART I,
3068,PART I,"But Ellen, spite of miry ways"
3069,PART I,"And weather dark and dreary,"
3070,PART I,"Trudged every day to Edward's house,"
3071,PART I,And made them all more cheery.
3072,PART I,
3073,PART I,"Oh! Ellen was a faithful friend,"
3074,PART I,More dear than any sister!
3075,PART I,As cheerful too as singing lark;
3076,PART I,"And she ne'er left them till 'twas dark,"
3077,PART I,And then they always missed her.
3078,PART I,
3079,PART I,And now Ash-Wednesday came-that day
3080,PART I,But few to church repair:
3081,PART I,For on that day you know we read
3082,PART I,The Commination prayer.
3083,PART I,
3084,PART I,"Our late old Vicar, a kind man,"
3085,PART I,"Once, Sir, he said to me,"
3086,PART I,He wished that service was clean out
3087,PART I,Of our good Liturgy.
3088,PART I,
3089,PART I,The mother walked into the church-
3090,PART I,To Ellen's seat she went:
3091,PART I,Though Ellen always kept her church
3092,PART I,All church-days during Lent.
3093,PART I,
3094,PART I,And gentle Ellen welcomed her
3095,PART I,With courteous looks and mild:
3096,PART I,"Thought she, ""What if her heart should melt,"
3097,PART I,"And all be reconciled!"""
3098,PART I,
3099,PART I,The day was scarcely like a day--
3100,PART I,The clouds were black outright:
3101,PART I,"And many a night, with half a moon,"
3102,PART I,I've seen the church more light.
3103,PART I,
3104,PART I,The wind was wild; against the glass
3105,PART I,The rain did beat and bicker;
3106,PART I,"The church-tower swinging over head,"
3107,PART I,You scarce could hear the Vicar!
3108,PART I,
3109,PART I,"And then and there the mother knelt,"
3110,PART I,And audibly she cried-
3111,PART I,"""Oh! may a clinging curse consume"
3112,PART I,This woman by my side!
3113,PART I,
3114,PART I,"""O hear me, hear me, Lord in Heaven,"
3115,PART I,Although you take my life--
3116,PART I,"O curse this woman, at whose house"
3117,PART I,Young Edward woo'd his wife.
3118,PART I,
3119,PART I,"""By night and day, in bed and bower,"
3120,PART I,"O let her cursed be!!! """
3121,PART I,"So having prayed, steady and slow,"
3122,PART I,She rose up from her knee!
3123,PART I,"And left the church, nor e'er again"
3124,PART I,The church-door entered she.
3125,PART I,
3126,PART I,"I saw poor Ellen kneeling still,"
3127,PART I,So pale! I guessed not why:
3128,PART I,"When she stood up, there plainly was"
3129,PART I,A trouble in her eye.
3130,PART I,
3131,PART I,"And when the prayers were done, we all"
3132,PART I,Came round and asked her why:
3133,PART I,"Giddy she seemed, and sure, there was"
3134,PART I,A trouble in her eye.
3135,PART I,
3136,PART I,But ere she from the church-door stepped
3137,PART I,She smiled and told us why:
3138,PART I,"""It was a wicked woman's curse,"""
3139,PART I,"Quoth she, ""and what care I?"""
3140,PART I,
3141,PART I,"She smiled, and smiled, and passed it off"
3142,PART I,Ere from the door she stept--
3143,PART I,But all agree it would have been
3144,PART I,Much better had she wept.
3145,PART I,
3146,PART I,"And if her heart was not at ease,"
3147,PART I,This was her constant cry--
3148,PART I,"""It was a wicked woman's curse--"
3149,PART I,"God's good, and what care I?"""
3150,PART I,
3151,PART I,"There was a hurry in her looks,"
3152,PART I,Her struggles she redoubled:
3153,PART I,"""It was a wicked woman's curse,"
3154,PART I,"And why should I be troubled?"""
3155,PART I,
3156,PART I,These tears will come--I dandled her
3157,PART I,When 'twas the merest fairy--
3158,PART I,Good creature! and she hid it all:
3159,PART I,She told it not to Mary.
3160,PART I,
3161,PART I,But Mary heard the tale: her arms
3162,PART I,Round Ellen's neck she threw;
3163,PART I,"""O Ellen, Ellen, she cursed me,"
3164,PART I,"And now she hath cursed you!"""
3165,PART I,
3166,PART I,I saw young Edward by himself
3167,PART I,"Stalk fast adown the lee,"
3168,PART I,"He snatched a stick from every fence,"
3169,PART I,A twig from every tree.
3170,PART I,
3171,PART I,"He snapped them still with hand or knee,"
3172,PART I,And then away they flew!
3173,PART I,As if with his uneasy limbs
3174,PART I,He knew not what to do!
3175,PART I,
3176,PART I,"You see, good Sir! that single hill?"
3177,PART I,His farm lies underneath:
3178,PART I,"He heard it there, he heard it all,"
3179,PART I,And only gnashed his teeth.
3180,PART I,
3181,PART I,Now Ellen was a darling love
3182,PART I,In all his joys and cares:
3183,PART I,And Ellen's name and Mary's name
3184,PART I,"Fast-linked they both together came,"
3185,PART I,Whene'er he said his prayers.
3186,PART I,
3187,PART I,And in the moment of his prayers
3188,PART I,He loved them both alike:
3189,PART I,"Yea, both sweet names with one sweet joy"
3190,PART I,Upon his heart did strike!
3191,PART I,
3192,PART I,"He reach'd his home, and by his looks"
3193,PART I,They saw his inward strife:
3194,PART I,"And they clung round him with their arms,"
3195,PART I,Both Ellen and his wife.
3196,PART I,
3197,PART I,"And Mary could not check her tears,"
3198,PART I,So on his breast she bowed;
3199,PART I,"Then frenzy melted into grief,"
3200,PART I,And Edward wept aloud.
3201,PART I,
3202,PART I,"Dear Ellen did not weep at all,"
3203,PART I,"But closelier did she cling,"
3204,PART I,And turned her face and looked as if
3205,PART I,She saw some frightful thing.
3206,PART I,
3207,PART I,
3208,PART II,PART II
3209,PART II,
3210,PART II,
3211,PART II,To see a man tread over graves
3212,PART II,I hold it no good mark;
3213,PART II,"'Tis wicked in the sun and moon,"
3214,PART II,And bad luck in the dark!
3215,PART II,
3216,PART II,"You see that grave? The Lord he gives,"
3217,PART II,"The Lord, he takes away:"
3218,PART II,O Sir! the child of my old age
3219,PART II,Lies there as cold as clay.
3220,PART II,
3221,PART II,"Except that grave, you scarce see one"
3222,PART II,That was not dug by me;
3223,PART II,I'd rather dance upon 'em all
3224,PART II,Than tread upon these three!
3225,PART II,
3226,PART II,"""Aye, Sexton!'tis a touching tale."""
3227,PART II,"You, Sir! are but a lad;"
3228,PART II,"This month I'm in my seventieth year,"
3229,PART II,And still it makes me sad.
3230,PART II,
3231,PART II,"And Mary's sister told it me,"
3232,PART II,For three good hours and more;
3233,PART II,"Though I had heard it, in the main,"
3234,PART II,"From Edward's self, before."
3235,PART II,
3236,PART II,Well! it passed off! the gentle Ellen
3237,PART II,Did well nigh dote on Mary;
3238,PART II,"And she went oftener than before,"
3239,PART II,And Mary loved her more and more:
3240,PART II,She managed all the dairy.
3241,PART II,
3242,PART II,"To market she on market-days,"
3243,PART II,To church on Sundays came;
3244,PART II,"All seemed the same: all seemed so, Sir!"
3245,PART II,But all was not the same!
3246,PART II,
3247,PART II,Had Ellen lost her mirth? Oh! no!
3248,PART II,But she was seldom cheerful;
3249,PART II,And Edward look'd as if he thought
3250,PART II,That Ellen's mirth was fearful.
3251,PART II,
3252,PART II,"When by herself, she to herself"
3253,PART II,Must sing some merry rhyme;
3254,PART II,"She could not now be glad for hours,"
3255,PART II,Yet silent all the time.
3256,PART II,
3257,PART II,"And when she soothed her friend, through all"
3258,PART II,Her soothing words 'twas plain
3259,PART II,"She had a sore grief of her own,"
3260,PART II,A haunting in her brain.
3261,PART II,
3262,PART II,"And oft she said, I'm not grown thin!"
3263,PART II,And then her wrist she spanned;
3264,PART II,"And once when Mary was down-cast,"
3265,PART II,"She took her by the hand,"
3266,PART II,"And gazed upon her, and at first"
3267,PART II,She gently pressed her hand;
3268,PART II,
3269,PART II,"Then harder, till her grasp at length"
3270,PART II,Did gripe like a convulsion!
3271,PART II,"""Alas!"" said she, ""we ne'er can be"
3272,PART II,"Made happy by compulsion!"""
3273,PART II,
3274,PART II,And once her both arms suddenly
3275,PART II,"Round Mary's neck she flung,"
3276,PART II,"And her heart panted, and she felt"
3277,PART II,The words upon her tongue.
3278,PART II,
3279,PART II,"She felt them coming, but no power"
3280,PART II,Had she the words to smother;
3281,PART II,"And with a kind of shriek she cried,"
3282,PART II,"""Oh Christ! you're like your mother!"""
3283,PART II,
3284,PART II,So gentle Ellen now no more
3285,PART II,Could make this sad house cheery;
3286,PART II,And Mary's melancholy ways
3287,PART II,Drove Edward wild and weary.
3288,PART II,
3289,PART II,"Lingering he raised his latch at eve,"
3290,PART II,Though tired in heart and limb:
3291,PART II,"He loved no other place, and yet"
3292,PART II,Home was no home to him.
3293,PART II,
3294,PART II,"One evening he took up a book,"
3295,PART II,And nothing in it read;
3296,PART II,"Then flung it down, and groaning cried,"
3297,PART II,"""O! Heaven! that I were dead."""
3298,PART II,
3299,PART II,"Mary looked up into his face,"
3300,PART II,And nothing to him said;
3301,PART II,"She tried to smile, and on his arm"
3302,PART II,Mournfully leaned her head.
3303,PART II,
3304,PART II,"And he burst into tears, and fell"
3305,PART II,Upon his knees in prayer:
3306,PART II,"""Her heart is broke! O God! my grief,"
3307,PART II,"It is too great to bear!"""
3308,PART II,
3309,PART II,'Twas such a foggy time as makes
3310,PART II,"Old sextons, Sir! like me,"
3311,PART II,Rest on their spades to cough; the spring
3312,PART II,Was late uncommonly.
3313,PART II,
3314,PART II,"And then the hot days, all at once,"
3315,PART II,"They came, we knew not how:"
3316,PART II,"You looked about for shade, when scarce"
3317,PART II,A leaf was on a bough.
3318,PART II,
3319,PART II,"It happened then ('twas in the bower,"
3320,PART II,A furlong up the wood:
3321,PART II,"Perhaps you know the place, and yet"
3322,PART II,"I scarce know how you should,)"
3323,PART II,
3324,PART II,"No path leads thither, 'tis not nigh"
3325,PART II,To any pasture-plot;
3326,PART II,"But clustered near the chattering brook,"
3327,PART II,Lone hollies marked the spot.
3328,PART II,
3329,PART II,Those hollies of themselves a shape
3330,PART II,"As of an arbour took,"
3331,PART II,"A close, round arbour; and it stands"
3332,PART II,Not three strides from a brook.
3333,PART II,
3334,PART II,"Within this arbour, which was still"
3335,PART II,"With scarlet berries hung,"
3336,PART II,"Were these three friends, one Sunday morn,"
3337,PART II,Just as the first bell rung.
3338,PART II,
3339,PART II,"'Tis sweet to hear a brook, 'tis sweet"
3340,PART II,"To hear the Sabbath-bell,"
3341,PART II,"'Tis sweet to hear them both at once,"
3342,PART II,Deep in a woody dell.
3343,PART II,
3344,PART II,"His limbs along the moss, his head"
3345,PART II,"Upon a mossy heap,"
3346,PART II,"With shut-up senses, Edward lay:"
3347,PART II,That brook e'en on a working day
3348,PART II,Might chatter one to sleep.
3349,PART II,
3350,PART II,"And he had passed a restless night,"

3962,ALARM OF AN INVASION,"And yield them worship, they are enemies"

4037,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",In the June of 1797 some long-expected friends paid a visit to the author's
4038,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","cottage; and on the morning of their arrival, he met with an accident,"
4039,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",which disabled him from walking during the whole time of their stay. One
4040,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","evening, when they had left him for a few hours, he composed the following"
4041,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",lines in the garden-bower.
4042,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",
4043,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Well, they are gone, and here must I remain,"

4050,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance,"
4051,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","To that still roaring dell, of which I told;"
4052,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","The roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep,"
4053,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",And only speckled by the mid-day sun;
4054,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock
4055,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Flings arching like a bridge--that branchless ash,"
4056,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Unsunned and damp, whose few poor yellow-leaves"
4057,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still,"
4058,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Fanned by the water-fall! and there my friends
4059,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Behold the dark green file of long lank weeds,"
4060,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",That all at once (a most fantastic sight!)
4061,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge
4062,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Of the blue clay-stone.
4063,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",
4064,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Now, my friends emerge"
4065,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Beneath the wide wide Heaven--and view again
4066,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",The many-steepled tract magnificent
4067,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea,"
4068,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","With some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up"
4069,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",The slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two Isles
4070,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Of purple shadow! Yes! they wander on

4074,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","In the great City pent, winning thy way"
4075,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","With sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain"
4076,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",And strange calamity! Ah! slowly sink
4077,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Behind the western ridge, thou glorious Sun!"
4078,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb,"

4097,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Dappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree

4099,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Full on the ancient ivy, which usurps"
4100,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass--"
4101,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue
4102,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Through the late twilight: and though now the bat
4103,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON","Wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,"
4104,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Yet still the solitary humble-bee
4105,"INDIA HOUSE, LONDON",Sings in the bean-flower! Henceforth I shall know

4141,MIND.,Wherein (high theme by thee first sung aright)
4142,MIND.,Of the foundations and the building up
4143,MIND.,Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell
4144,MIND.,"What may be told, to the understanding mind"
4145,MIND.,Revealable; and what within the mind
4146,MIND.,By vital breathings secret as the soul
4147,MIND.,"Of vernal growth, oft quickens in the heart"
4148,MIND.,Thoughts all too deep for words!--
4149,MIND.,
4150,MIND.,Theme hard as high!
4151,MIND.,"Of smiles spontaneous, and mysterious fears"
4152,MIND.,"(The first-born they of Reason and twin-birth),"
4153,MIND.,"Of tides obedient to external force,"
4154,MIND.,"And currents self-determined, as might seem,"
4155,MIND.,"Or by some inner Power; of moments awful,"
4156,MIND.,"Now in thy inner life, and now abroad,"
4157,MIND.,"When power streamed from thee, and thy soul received"
4158,MIND.,"The light reflected, as a light bestowed--"
4159,MIND.,"Of fancies fair, and milder hours of youth,"
4160,MIND.,Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought
4161,MIND.,"Industrious in its joy, in vales and glens"
4162,MIND.,"Native or outland, lakes and famous hills!"
4163,MIND.,"Or on the lonely high-road, when the stars"
4164,MIND.,"Were rising; or by secret mountain-streams,"
4165,MIND.,The guides and the companions of thy way!
4166,MIND.,
4167,MIND.,"Of more than Fancy, of the Social Sense"
4168,MIND.,"Distending wide, and man beloved as man,"
4169,MIND.,Where France in all her towns lay vibrating
4170,MIND.,Like some becalmed bark beneath the burst
4171,MIND.,"Of Heaven's immediate thunder, when no cloud"
4172,MIND.,"Is visible, or shadow on the main."
4173,MIND.,"For thou wert there, thine own brows garlanded,"
4174,MIND.,"Amid the tremor of a realm aglow,"
4175,MIND.,"Amid a mighty nation jubilant,"
4176,MIND.,When from the general heart of human kind
4177,MIND.,Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity!
4178,MIND.,"--Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down,"
4179,MIND.,"So summoned homeward, thenceforth calm and sure"
4180,MIND.,"From the dread watch-tower of man's absolute self,"
4181,MIND.,"With light unwaning on her eyes, to look"
4182,MIND.,"Far on-herself a glory to behold,"
4183,MIND.,The Angel of the vision! Then (last strain)
4184,MIND.,"Of Duty, chosen Laws controlling choice,"
4185,MIND.,"Action and joy!--An orphic song indeed,"
4186,MIND.,A song divine of high and passionate thoughts
4187,MIND.,To their own music chaunted!
4188,MIND.,
4189,MIND.,O great Bard!
4190,MIND.,"Ere yet that last strain dying awed the air,"
4191,MIND.,With steadfast eye I viewed thee in the choir
4192,MIND.,Of ever-enduring men. The truly great
4193,MIND.,"Have all one age, and from one visible space"
4194,MIND.,"Shed influence! They, both in power and act,"
4195,MIND.,"Are permanent, and Time is not with _them_,"
4196,MIND.,"Save as it worketh _for_ them, they _in_ it."
4197,MIND.,"Nor less a sacred Roll, than those of old,"
4198,MIND.,"And to be placed, as they, with gradual fame"
4199,MIND.,"Among the archives of mankind, thy work"
4200,MIND.,"Makes audible a linked lay of Truth,"
4201,MIND.,"Of Truth profound a sweet continuous lay,"
4202,MIND.,"Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes"
4203,MIND.,"Ah! as I listen'd with a heart forlorn,"
4204,MIND.,The pulses of my being beat anew:
4205,MIND.,"And even as life retains upon the drowned,"
4206,MIND.,Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains--
4207,MIND.,"Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe"
4208,MIND.,"Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart;"
4209,MIND.,"And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of hope;"
4210,MIND.,And hope that scarce would know itself from fear;
4211,MIND.,"Sense of past youth, and manhood come in vain,"
4212,MIND.,"And genius given, and knowledge won in vain;"
4213,MIND.,"And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,"
4214,MIND.,"And all which patient toil had reared, and all,"
4215,MIND.,Commune with _thee_ had opened out--but flowers
4216,MIND.,"Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier,"
4217,MIND.,"In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!"
4218,MIND.,
4219,MIND.,"That way no more! and ill beseems it me,"
4220,MIND.,"Who came a welcomer in herald's guise,"
4221,MIND.,"Singing of glory, and futurity,"
4222,MIND.,"To wander back on such unhealthful road,"
4223,MIND.,Plucking the poisons of self-harm! And ill
4224,MIND.,Such intertwine beseems triumphal wreaths
4225,MIND.,Strew'd before _thy_ advancing!
4226,MIND.,
4227,MIND.,"Nor do thou,"
4228,MIND.,Sage Bard! impair the memory of that hour
4229,MIND.,Of thy communion with my nobler mind
4230,MIND.,"By pity or grief, already felt too long!"
4231,MIND.,Nor let my words import more blame than needs.
4232,MIND.,The tumult rose and ceased: for Peace is nigh
4233,MIND.,Where wisdom's voice has found a listening heart.
4234,MIND.,"Amid the howl of more than wintry storms,"
4235,MIND.,The halcyon hears the voice of vernal hours
4236,MIND.,Already on the wing.
4237,MIND.,
4238,MIND.,"Eve following eve,"
4239,MIND.,"Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home"
4240,MIND.,Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed
4241,MIND.,"And more desired, more precious, for thy song,"
4242,MIND.,"In silence listening like a devout child,"
4243,MIND.,"My soul lay passive, by thy various strain"
4244,MIND.,"Driven as in surges now beneath the stars,"
4245,MIND.,"With momentary stars of my own birth,"
4246,MIND.,"Fair constellated foam, still darting off"
4247,MIND.,"Into the darkness; now a tranquil sea,"
4248,MIND.,"Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon."
4249,MIND.,
4250,MIND.,And when--O Friend! my comforter and guide!
4251,MIND.,"Strong in thyself, and powerful to give strength!--"
4252,MIND.,"Thy long sustained Song finally closed,"
4253,MIND.,And thy deep voice had ceased--yet thou thyself
4254,MIND.,"Wert still before my eyes, and round us both"
4255,MIND.,That happy vision of beloved faces--
4256,MIND.,"Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close"
4257,MIND.,"I sate, my being blended in one thought"
4258,MIND.,(Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)
4259,MIND.,"Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound--"
4260,MIND.,"And when I rose, I found myself in prayer."

4429,FROST AT MIDNIGHT,"And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,"

4433,FROST AT MIDNIGHT,"But _thou_, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze"

6732,A WAR ECLOGUE,_Fam._ Sisters! sisters! who sent you here?

6734,A WAR ECLOGUE,_Slau._ [to Fire]. I will whisper it in her ear.

6742,A WAR ECLOGUE,"Leaped up at once in anarchy,"
6743,A WAR ECLOGUE,Clapped their hands and danced for glee.
6744,A WAR ECLOGUE,They no longer heeded me;

6775,A WAR ECLOGUE,To frighten the wolf and carrion-crow
6776,A WAR ECLOGUE,And the homeless dog--but they would not go.
6777,A WAR ECLOGUE,So off I flew: for how could I bear
6778,A WAR ECLOGUE,To see them gorge their dainty fare?
6779,A WAR ECLOGUE,"I heard a groan and a peevish squall,"

6798,A WAR ECLOGUE,"And all the while the work was done,"
6799,A WAR ECLOGUE,"On as I strode with my huge strides,"
6800,A WAR ECLOGUE,"I flung back my head and I held my sides,"
6801,A WAR ECLOGUE,It was so rare a piece of fun
6802,A WAR ECLOGUE,To see the sweltered cattle run
6803,A WAR ECLOGUE,"With uncouth gallop through the night,"
6804,A WAR ECLOGUE,Scared by the red and noisy light!
6805,A WAR ECLOGUE,By the light of his own blazing cot

6820,A WAR ECLOGUE,How shall we yield him honour due?
6821,A WAR ECLOGUE,
6822,A WAR ECLOGUE,_Fam._ Wisdom comes with lack of food.
6823,A WAR ECLOGUE,"I'll gnaw, I'll gnaw the multitude,"

6825,A WAR ECLOGUE,They shall seize him and his brood--
6826,A WAR ECLOGUE,

6832,A WAR ECLOGUE,"Ninety months he, by my troth!"
6833,A WAR ECLOGUE,Hath richly catered for you both;

7348,NOTES,"I am indebted to Mr. Heinemann, the owner of the copyright of Dykes"
7349,NOTES,"Campbell's edition of Coleridge's Poetical Works (Macmillan & Co., 1893)"
7350,NOTES,for permission to use that text (one of the most carefully edited texts of
7351,NOTES,"any English poet) in this volume of selections. My aim, in making these"
7352,NOTES,"selections, has been to give every poem of Coleridge's that seems to me"
7353,NOTES,"really good, and nothing else. Not every poem, none perhaps of those in"
7354,NOTES,"blank verse, is equal throughout; but I think readers of Coleridge will be"
7355,NOTES,surprised to find how few of the poems contained in this volume are not of
7356,NOTES,"almost flawless workmanship, as well of incomparable poetic genius."
7357,NOTES,Scarcely any English poet gains so much as Coleridge by not being read in a
7358,NOTES,complete edition. The gulf between his best and his worst work is as wide
7359,NOTES,"as the gulf between good and evil. Even Wordsworth, even Byron, is not so"
7360,NOTES,"intolerable to read in a complete edition. But Coleridge, much more easily"
7361,NOTES,"than Byron or Wordsworth, can be extricated from his own lumber-heaps; it"
7362,NOTES,is rare in his work to find a poem which is really good in parts and not
7363,NOTES,really good as a whole. I have taken every poem on its own merits as
7364,NOTES,"poetry, its own technical merits as verse; and thus have included equally"
7365,NOTES,"the frigid eighteenth-century conceits of ""The Kiss"" and the modern"
7366,NOTES,burlesque license of the comic fragments. But I have excluded everything
7367,NOTES,"which has an interest merely personal, or indeed any other interest than"
7368,NOTES,"that of poetry; and I have thus omitted the famous ""Ode on the Departing"
7369,NOTES,"Year,"" in spite of the esteem in which Coleridge held it, and in spite of"
7370,NOTES,its one exquisite line--
7371,NOTES,
7372,NOTES,
7373,NOTES,"""God's image, sister of the Seraphim""--"
7374,NOTES,
7375,NOTES,
7376,NOTES,"and I have omitted it because as a whole it is untempered rhetoric,"
7377,NOTES,shapeless in form; and I have also omitted confession pieces such as that
7378,NOTES,"early one which contains, among its otherwise too emphatic utterances, the"
7379,NOTES,most delicate and precise picture which Coleridge ever drew of himself:
7380,NOTES,
7381,NOTES,
7382,NOTES,"""To me hath Heaven with bounteous hand assigned"
7383,NOTES,"Energic Reason and a shaping mind,"
7384,NOTES,"The daring ken of Truth, the Patriot's part,"
7385,NOTES,"And Pity's sigh, that breathes the gentle heart--"
7386,NOTES,Sloth-jaundiced all! and from my graspless hand
7387,NOTES,"Drop Friendship's precious pearls, like hour-glass sand."

7589,PART VII,p. 27. _Christabel_. Coleridge at his best represents the imaginative
7590,PART VII,"temper in its essence, pure gold, with only just enough alloy to give it"
7591,PART VII,"firm bodily substance. ""Christabel"" is not, like ""Kubla Khan,"" a"
7592,PART VII,"disembodied ecstasy, but a coherent effort of the imagination. Yet, when we"
7593,PART VII,"come to the second part, the magic is already half gone out of it. Rossetti"
7594,PART VII,"says, in a printed letter, with admirable truth: ""The conception, and"
7595,PART VII,"partly the execution, of the passage in which Christabel repeats by"
7596,PART VII,"fascination the serpent-glance of Geraldine, is magnificent; but that is"
7597,PART VII,the only good narrative passage in part two. The rest seems to have reached
7598,PART VII,"a fatal facility of jingling, at the heels whereof followed Scott."" A few"
7599,PART VII,"of the lines seem to sink almost lower than Scott, and suggest a Gilbert"
7600,PART VII,parody:
7601,PART VII,
7602,PART VII,
7603,PART VII,"""He bids thee come without delay"
7604,PART VII,With all thy numerous array.

7610,PART VII,
7611,PART VII,
7612,PART VII,"But in the conclusion, which has nothing whatever to do with the poem,"
7613,PART VII,Coleridge is his finest self again: a magical psychologist. It is
7614,PART VII,interesting to know that Crashaw was the main influence upon Coleridge
7615,PART VII,"while writing ""Christabel,"" and that the ""Hymn to the Name and Honour of"
7616,PART VII,"the admirable S. Teresa"" was ""ever present to his mind while writing the"
7617,PART VII,"second part."""
7618,PART VII,
7619,PART VII,"p. 61. _Love_. This poem was originally published, in the _Morning"
7620,PART VII,"Post_ of December 21, 1799, as part of an ""Introduction to the Tale of"
7621,PART VII,"the Dark Ladié."" This introduction begins:"
7622,PART VII,

7639,PART VII,
7640,PART VII,"p. 65. _The Three Graves_. Coleridge only published what he calls ""the"
7641,PART VII,"following humble fragment"" of what was to have been a poem in six parts;"
7642,PART VII,"but he wrote an imperfect sketch of the first two parts, which was"
7643,PART VII,published from the original MS. by Dykes Campbell in his edition. The poem
7644,PART VII,"as Coleridge left it is sufficiently complete, and I have ventured to"
7645,PART VII,"divide it into Part I. and Part II., instead of the usual Part III. and"
7646,PART VII,Part IV. It is Coleridge's one attempt to compete with Wordsworth on what
7647,PART VII,"Wordsworth considered his own ground, and it was first published by"
7648,PART VII,"Coleridge in _The Friend_ of September 21, 1809, on the advice of"
7649,PART VII,"Wordsworth and Southey. ""The language,"" we are told in an introductory"
7650,PART VII,"note, ""was intended to be dramatic; that is, suited to the narrator; and"
7651,PART VII,the metre corresponds to the homeliness of the diction. It is therefore
7652,PART VII,"presented as the fragment, not of a poem, but of a common Ballad-tale."
7653,PART VII,"Whether this is sufficient to justify the adoption of such a style, in any"
7654,PART VII,"metrical composition not professedly ludicrous, the Author is himself in"
7655,PART VII,"some doubt. At all events, it is not presented as poetry, and it is in no"
7656,PART VII,way connected with the Author's judgment concerning poetic diction. Its
7657,PART VII,"merits, if any, are exclusively psychological."" Exclusively, it would be"
7658,PART VII,unjust to say; but to a degree beyond those of any similar poem of
7659,PART VII,"Wordsworth, certainly."
7660,PART VII,
7661,PART VII,"p. 78. _Dejection_. This ode was originally addressed to Wordsworth,"
7662,PART VII,"but before it was published in its first form, the ""William"" of the still"
7663,PART VII,"existing MS. was changed to ""Edmund""; in later editions ""Edmund"" was"
7664,PART VII,"changed to ""Lady,"" except in the seventh stanza, where ""Otway"" is"
7665,PART VII,"substituted. The reference in this stanza is to Wordsworth's ""Lucy Gray,"""
7666,PART VII,"and the germ of the passage occurs in a letter of Coleridge to Poole,"
7667,PART VII,"printed by Dykes Campbell in the notes to his edition: ""Greta Hall, Feb. 1,"
7668,PART VII,"1801.--O my dear, dear Friend! that you were with me by the fireside of my"
7669,PART VII,"study here, that I might talk it over with you to the tune of this night-"
7670,PART VII,"wind that pipes its thin, doleful, climbing, sinking notes, like a child"
7671,PART VII,"that has lost its way, and is crying aloud, half in grief, and half in the"
7672,PART VII,"hope to be heard by its mother."""
7673,PART VII,
7674,PART VII,"p. 9O. _Fears in Solitude_. Coleridge, who was so often his own best"
7675,PART VII,"critic, especially when the criticism was to remain inactive, wrote on an"
7676,PART VII,"autograph copy of this poem now belonging to Professor Dowden: ""N.B.--The"
7677,PART VII,"above is perhaps not Poetry,--but rather a sort of middle thing between"
7678,PART VII,"Poetry and Oratory--_sermoni propriora_.--Some parts are, I am"
7679,PART VII,"conscious, too tame even for animated prose."" It is difficult to say"
7680,PART VII,"whether, in such poems as this, Coleridge is overtaken by his besetting"
7681,PART VII,"indolence, or whether he is deliberately writing down to the theories of"
7682,PART VII,"Wordsworth. Another criticism of his own on his early blank verse, where he"
7683,PART VII,"speaks of ""the utter want of all rhythm in the verse, the monotony and dead"
7684,PART VII,"_plumb down_ of the pauses, and the absence of all bone, muscle and"
7685,PART VII,"sinew in the single lines,"" applies only too well to the larger part of"
7686,PART VII,"his work in this difficult metre, so apt to go to sleep by the way."
7687,PART VII,
7688,PART VII,"p. 1O7. _Hymn before Sun-rise_. Coleridge was never at Chamouni, and"
7689,PART VII,the suggestion of his poem is to be found in a poem of twenty lines by a
7690,PART VII,"German poetess, Frederike Brun. Some of the rhetoric of his poem Coleridge"
7691,PART VII,got from the German poetess; the imagination is all his own. It is perhaps
7692,PART VII,a consequence of its origin that the imagination and the rhetoric never get
7693,PART VII,"quite clear of one another, and that, in spite of some magical lines"
7694,PART VII,(wholly Coleridge's) like:
7695,PART VII,
7696,PART VII,
7697,PART VII,"""O struggling with the darkness all the night,"
7698,PART VII,"And visited all night by troops of stars:"""

7714,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"poem, in which Coleridge's style is seen in its most faultless union of his"
7715,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"finest qualities, compare this passage from a letter to Lady Beaumont,"
7716,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"about a year earlier: ""Though I am at present sadly below even _my_"
7717,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"par of health, or rather unhealth, and am the more depressed thereby from"

7720,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"birds, the sun so gladsome, the breezes with such healing on their wings,"
7721,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"all good and lovely things are beneath me, above me, and everywhere around"
7722,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"me, and all from God, while my incapability of enjoying, or, at best,"
7723,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"languor in receiving them, is directly or indirectly from myself, from past"
7724,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"procrastination, and cowardly impatience of pain."" It was always upon some"
7725,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),not less solid foundation that Coleridge built these delicate structures.

7727,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"p. 147. _Phantom_. This, almost Coleridge's loveliest fragment of"
7728,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"verse, was composed in sleep, like ""Kubla Khan,"" ""Constancy to an Ideal"
7729,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"Object,"" and ""Phantom or Fact?"" There is a quality, in this and some other"
7730,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"poems of Coleridge, which he himself has exquisitely rendered in the"
7731,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"passage on Ariel in the lectures on Shakespeare: ""In air he lives, from air"
7732,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"he derives his being, in air he acts; and all his colours and properties"
7733,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),seem to have been obtained from the rainbow and the skies. There is nothing
7734,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),about Ariel that cannot be conceived to exist either at sunrise or sunset:
7735,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),hence all that belongs to Ariel belongs to the delight the mind is capable
7736,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"of receiving from the most lovely external appearances. ""Coleridge is the"
7737,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"Ariel of English Poetry: glittering in the song from ""Zapolya,"" translucent"
7738,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"in the ""Phantom,"" infantine, with a note of happy infancy almost like that"
7739,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"of Blake, in ""Something Childish, but very Natural."" In these poems, and in"
7740,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"the ""Ode to the Rain,"" and the ""Inscription for a Fountain on a Heath,"""
7741,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"there is a unique way of feeling, which he can render to us on those rare"
7742,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"occasions when his sensations are uninterrupted; by thought, which clouds"
7743,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"them, or by emotion, which disturbs them. He reveals mysterious intimacies"
7744,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"with natural things, the ""flapping"" flame or a child's scarcely more"
7745,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"articulate moods. And in some of them, which are experiments in form, he"
7746,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"seems to compete gaily with the Elizabethan lyrists, doing wonderful things"
7747,(DYKES CAMPBELL.),"in jest, like one who is for once happy and disengaged, and able to play"
