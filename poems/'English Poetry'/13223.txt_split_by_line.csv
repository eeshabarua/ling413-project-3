133,I.,I.
134,I.,
135,I.,"An empty sky, a world of heather,"
136,I.,"Purple of foxglove, yellow of broom;"
137,I.,"We two among them wading together,"
138,I.,"Shaking out honey, treading perfume."
139,I.,
140,I.,"Crowds of bees are giddy with clover,"
141,I.,"Crowds of grasshoppers skip at our feet,"
142,I.,"Crowds of larks at their matins hang over,"
143,I.,Thanking the Lord for a life so sweet.
144,I.,
145,I.,"Flusheth the rise with her purple favor,"
146,I.,"Gloweth the cleft with her golden ring,"
147,I.,"'Twixt the two brown butterflies waver,"
148,I.,"Lightly settle, and sleepily swing."
149,I.,
150,I.,We two walk till the purple dieth
151,I.,And short dry grass under foot is brown.
152,I.,But one little streak at a distance lieth
153,I.,Green like a ribbon to prank the down.
154,I.,
155,I.,
156,II.,II.
157,II.,
158,II.,"Over the grass we stepped unto it,"
159,II.,And God He knoweth how blithe we were!
160,II.,Never a voice to bid us eschew it:
161,II.,Hey the green ribbon that showed so fair!
162,II.,
163,II.,"Hey the green ribbon! we kneeled beside it,"
164,II.,We parted the grasses dewy and sheen;
165,II.,Drop over drop there filtered and slided
166,II.,A tiny bright beck that trickled between.
167,II.,
168,II.,"Tinkle, tinkle, sweetly it sang to us,"
169,II.,Light was our talk as of faëry bells--
170,II.,Faëry wedding-bells faintly rung to us
171,II.,Down in their fortunate parallels.
172,II.,
173,II.,"Hand in hand, while the sun peered over,"
174,II.,We lapped the grass on that youngling spring;
175,II.,"Swept back its rushes, smoothed its clover,"
176,II.,"And said, ""Let us follow it westering."""
177,II.,
178,II.,
179,III.,III.
180,III.,
181,III.,"A dappled sky, a world of meadows,"
182,III.,Circling above us the black rooks fly
183,III.,"Forward, backward; lo, their dark shadows"
184,III.,Flit on the blossoming tapestry--
185,III.,
186,III.,"Flit on the beck, for her long grass parteth"
187,III.,As hair from a maid's bright eyes blown back;
188,III.,"And, lo, the sun like a lover darteth"
189,III.,His flattering smile on her wayward track.
190,III.,
191,III.,Sing on! we sing in the glorious weather
192,III.,"Till one steps over the tiny strand,"
193,III.,"So narrow, in sooth, that still together"
194,III.,On either brink we go hand in hand.
195,III.,
196,III.,"The beck grows wider, the hands must sever."
197,III.,"On either margin, our songs all done,"
198,III.,"We move apart, while she singeth ever,"
199,III.,Taking the course of the stooping sun.
200,III.,
201,III.,"He prays, ""Come over""--I may not follow;"
202,III.,"I cry, ""Return""--but he cannot come:"
203,III.,"We speak, we laugh, but with voices hollow;"
204,III.,"Our hands are hanging, our hearts are numb."
205,III.,
206,III.,
207,IV.,IV.
208,IV.,
209,IV.,"A breathing sigh, a sigh for answer,"
210,IV.,A little talking of outward things
211,IV.,"The careless beck is a merry dancer,"
212,IV.,Keeping sweet time to the air she sings.
213,IV.,
214,IV.,A little pain when the beck grows wider;
215,IV.,"""Cross to me now--for her wavelets swell."""
216,IV.,"""I may not cross,""--and the voice beside her"
217,IV.,"Faintly reacheth, though heeded well."
218,IV.,
219,IV.,No backward path; ah! no returning;
220,IV.,No second crossing that ripple's flow:
221,IV.,"""Come to me now, for the west is burning;"
222,IV.,"Come ere it darkens;""--""Ah, no! ah, no!"""
223,IV.,
224,IV.,"Then cries of pain, and arms outreaching--"
225,IV.,The beck grows wider and swift and deep:
226,IV.,Passionate words as of one beseeching--
227,IV.,"The loud beck drowns them; we walk, and weep."
228,IV.,
229,IV.,
230,V.,V.
231,V.,
232,V.,"A yellow moon in splendor drooping,"
233,V.,"A tired queen with her state oppressed,"
234,V.,"Low by rushes and swordgrass stooping,"
235,V.,Lies she soft on the waves at rest.
236,V.,
237,V.,The desert heavens have felt her sadness;
238,V.,Her earth will weep her some dewy tears;
239,V.,"The wild beck ends her tune of gladness,"
240,V.,And goeth stilly as soul that fears.
241,V.,
242,V.,We two walk on in our grassy places
243,V.,"On either marge of the moonlit flood,"
244,V.,"With the moon's own sadness in our faces,"
245,V.,"Where joy is withered, blossom and bud."
246,V.,
247,V.,
248,VI.,VI.
249,VI.,
250,VI.,"A shady freshness, chafers whirring,"
251,VI.,A little piping of leaf-hid birds;
252,VI.,"A flutter of wings, a fitful stirring,"
253,VI.,A cloud to the eastward snowy as curds.
254,VI.,
255,VI.,"Bare grassy slopes, where kids are tethered"
256,VI.,Round valleys like nests all ferny-lined;
257,VI.,"Round hills, with fluttering tree-tops feathered,"
258,VI.,Swell high in their freckled robes behind.
259,VI.,
260,VI.,"A rose-flush tender, a thrill, a quiver,"
261,VI.,When golden gleams to the tree-tops glide;
262,VI.,"A flashing edge for the milk-white river,"
263,VI.,"The beck, a river--with still sleek tide."
264,VI.,
265,VI.,"Broad and white, and polished as silver,"
266,VI.,On she goes under fruit-laden trees;
267,VI.,"Sunk in leafage cooeth the culver,"
268,VI.,And 'plaineth of love's disloyalties.
269,VI.,
270,VI.,"Glitters the dew and shines the river,"
271,VI.,Up comes the lily and dries her bell;
272,VI.,"But two are walking apart forever,"
273,VI.,And wave their hands for a mute farewell.
274,VI.,
275,VI.,
276,VII.,VII.
277,VII.,
278,VII.,"A braver swell, a swifter sliding;"
279,VII.,"The river hasteth, her banks recede:"
280,VII.,Wing-like sails on her bosom gliding
281,VII.,Bear down the lily and drown the reed.
282,VII.,
283,VII.,Stately prows are rising and bowing
284,VII.,"(Shouts of mariners winnow the air),"
285,VII.,And level sands for banks endowing
286,VII.,The tiny green ribbon that showed so fair.
287,VII.,
288,VII.,"While, O my heart! as white sails shiver,"
289,VII.,"And crowds are passing, and banks stretch wide"
290,VII.,"How hard to follow, with lips that quiver,"
291,VII.,That moving speck on the far-off side!
292,VII.,
293,VII.,"Farther, farther--I see it--know it--"
294,VII.,"My eyes brim over, it melts away:"
295,VII.,Only my heart to my heart shall show it
296,VII.,As I walk desolate day by day.
297,VII.,
298,VII.,
299,VII.,VII.
300,VII.,
301,VII.,"And yet I know past all doubting, truly--"
302,VII.,A knowledge greater than grief can dim--
303,VII.,"I know, as he loved, he will love me duly--"
304,VII.,Yea better--e'en better than I love him.
305,VII.,
306,VII.,"And as I walk by the vast calm river,"
307,VII.,"The awful river so dread to see,"
308,VII.,"I say, ""Thy breadth and thy depth forever"
309,VII.,"Are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me."""

315,HONORS.--PART I.,
316,HONORS.--PART I.,(_A Scholar is musing on his want of success._)
317,HONORS.--PART I.,
318,HONORS.--PART I.,
319,HONORS.--PART I.,"To strive--and fail. Yes, I did strive and fail;"
320,HONORS.--PART I.,I set mine eyes upon a certain night
321,HONORS.--PART I.,To find a certain star--and could not hail
322,HONORS.--PART I.,With them its deep-set light.
323,HONORS.--PART I.,
324,HONORS.--PART I.,Fool that I was! I will rehearse my fault:
325,HONORS.--PART I.,"I, wingless, thought myself on high to lift"
326,HONORS.--PART I.,Among the winged--I set these feet that halt
327,HONORS.--PART I.,To run against the swift.
328,HONORS.--PART I.,
329,HONORS.--PART I.,"And yet this man, that loved me so, can write--"
330,HONORS.--PART I.,"That loves me, I would say, can let me see;"
331,HONORS.--PART I.,Or fain would have me think he counts but light
332,HONORS.--PART I.,These Honors lost to me.
333,HONORS.--PART I.,
334,HONORS.--PART I.,(_The letter of his friend._)
335,HONORS.--PART I.,"""What are they? that old house of yours which gave"
336,HONORS.--PART I.,"Such welcome oft to me, the sunbeams fall"
337,HONORS.--PART I.,"Yet, down the squares of blue and white which pave"
338,HONORS.--PART I.,Its hospitable hall.
339,HONORS.--PART I.,
340,HONORS.--PART I.,"""A brave old house! a garden full of bees,"
341,HONORS.--PART I.,"Large dropping poppies, and Queen hollyhocks,"
342,HONORS.--PART I.,With butterflies for crowns--tree peonies
343,HONORS.--PART I.,And pinks and goldilocks.
344,HONORS.--PART I.,
345,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Go, when the shadow of your house is long"
346,HONORS.--PART I.,Upon the garden--when some new-waked bird.
347,HONORS.--PART I.,"Pecking and fluttering, chirps a sudden song,"
348,HONORS.--PART I.,And not a leaf is stirred;
349,HONORS.--PART I.,
350,HONORS.--PART I.,"""But every one drops dew from either edge"
351,HONORS.--PART I.,"Upon its fellow, while an amber ray"
352,HONORS.--PART I.,Slants up among the tree-tops like a wedge
353,HONORS.--PART I.,Of liquid gold--to play
354,HONORS.--PART I.,
355,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Over and under them, and so to fall"
356,HONORS.--PART I.,Upon that lane of water lying below--
357,HONORS.--PART I.,"That piece of sky let in, that you do call"
358,HONORS.--PART I.,"A pond, but which I know"
359,HONORS.--PART I.,
360,HONORS.--PART I.,"""To be a deep and wondrous world; for I"
361,HONORS.--PART I.,Have seen the trees within it--marvellous things
362,HONORS.--PART I.,So thick no bird betwixt their leaves could fly
363,HONORS.--PART I.,But she would smite her wings;--
364,HONORS.--PART I.,
365,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Go there, I say; stand at the water's brink,"
366,HONORS.--PART I.,And shoals of spotted barbel you shall see
367,HONORS.--PART I.,"Basking between the shadows--look, and think"
368,HONORS.--PART I.,'This beauty is for me;
369,HONORS.--PART I.,
370,HONORS.--PART I.,"""'For me this freshness in the morning hours,"
371,HONORS.--PART I.,For me the water's clear tranquillity;
372,HONORS.--PART I.,For me the soft descent of chestnut flowers;
373,HONORS.--PART I.,The cushat's cry for me.
374,HONORS.--PART I.,
375,HONORS.--PART I.,"""'The lovely laughter of the wind-swayed wheat"
376,HONORS.--PART I.,The easy slope of yonder pastoral hill;
377,HONORS.--PART I.,The sedgy brook whereby the red kine meet
378,HONORS.--PART I.,And wade and drink their fill.'
379,HONORS.--PART I.,
380,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Then saunter down that terrace whence the sea"

384,HONORS.--PART I.,
385,HONORS.--PART I.,"""'For me the bounding in of tides; for me"
386,HONORS.--PART I.,The laying bare of sands when they retreat;
387,HONORS.--PART I.,"The purple flush of calms, the sparkling glee"
388,HONORS.--PART I.,When waves and sunshine meet.'
389,HONORS.--PART I.,
390,HONORS.--PART I.,"""So, after gazing, homeward turn, and mount"
391,HONORS.--PART I.,To that long chamber in the roof; there tell
392,HONORS.--PART I.,Your heart the laid-up lore it holds to count
393,HONORS.--PART I.,And prize and ponder well.
394,HONORS.--PART I.,
395,HONORS.--PART I.,"""The lookings onward of the race before"
396,HONORS.--PART I.,It had a past to make it look behind;
397,HONORS.--PART I.,"Its reverent wonder, and its doubting sore,"
398,HONORS.--PART I.,Its adoration blind.
399,HONORS.--PART I.,
400,HONORS.--PART I.,"""The thunder of its war-songs, and the glow"
401,HONORS.--PART I.,Of chants to freedom by the old world sung;
402,HONORS.--PART I.,The sweet love cadences that long ago
403,HONORS.--PART I.,Dropped from the old-world tongue.
404,HONORS.--PART I.,
405,HONORS.--PART I.,"""And then this new-world lore that takes account"
406,HONORS.--PART I.,Of tangled star-dust; maps the triple whirl
407,HONORS.--PART I.,Of blue and red and argent worlds that mount
408,HONORS.--PART I.,And greet the IRISH EARL;
409,HONORS.--PART I.,
410,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Or float across the tube that HERSCHEL sways,"
411,HONORS.--PART I.,"Like pale-rose chaplets, or like sapphire mist;"
412,HONORS.--PART I.,"Or hang or droop along the heavenly ways,"
413,HONORS.--PART I.,Like scarves of amethyst.
414,HONORS.--PART I.,
415,HONORS.--PART I.,"""O strange it is and wide the new-world lore,"
416,HONORS.--PART I.,For next it treateth of our native dust!
417,HONORS.--PART I.,"Must dig out buried monsters, and explore"
418,HONORS.--PART I.,The green earth's fruitful crust;
419,HONORS.--PART I.,
420,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Must write the story of her seething youth--"
421,HONORS.--PART I.,How lizards paddled in her lukewarm seas;
422,HONORS.--PART I.,"Must show the cones she ripened, and forsooth"
423,HONORS.--PART I.,Count seasons on her trees;
424,HONORS.--PART I.,
425,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Must know her weight, and pry into her age,"
426,HONORS.--PART I.,Count her old beach lines by their tidal swell;
427,HONORS.--PART I.,"Her sunken mountains name, her craters gauge,"
428,HONORS.--PART I.,Her cold volcanoes tell;
429,HONORS.--PART I.,
430,HONORS.--PART I.,"""And treat her as a ball, that one might pass"
431,HONORS.--PART I.,From this hand to the other--such a ball
432,HONORS.--PART I.,"As he could measure with a blade of grass,"
433,HONORS.--PART I.,And say it was but small!
434,HONORS.--PART I.,
435,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Honors! O friend, I pray you bear with me:"
436,HONORS.--PART I.,"The grass hath time to grow in meadow lands,"
437,HONORS.--PART I.,And leisurely the opal murmuring sea
438,HONORS.--PART I.,Breaks on her yellow sands;
439,HONORS.--PART I.,
440,HONORS.--PART I.,"""And leisurely the ring-dove on her nest"
441,HONORS.--PART I.,Broods till her tender chick will peck the shell
442,HONORS.--PART I.,And leisurely down fall from ferny crest
443,HONORS.--PART I.,The dew-drops on the well;
444,HONORS.--PART I.,
445,HONORS.--PART I.,"""And leisurely your life and spirit grew,"
446,HONORS.--PART I.,With yet the time to grow and ripen free:
447,HONORS.--PART I.,"No judgment past withdraws that boon from you,"
448,HONORS.--PART I.,Nor granteth it to me.
449,HONORS.--PART I.,
450,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Still must I plod, and still in cities moil;"
451,HONORS.--PART I.,"From precious leisure, learned leisure far,"
452,HONORS.--PART I.,Dull my best self with handling common soil;
453,HONORS.--PART I.,Yet mine those honors are.
454,HONORS.--PART I.,
455,HONORS.--PART I.,"""Mine they are called; they are a name which means,"
456,HONORS.--PART I.,"'This man had steady pulses, tranquil nerves:"
457,HONORS.--PART I.,"Here, as in other fields, the most he gleans"
458,HONORS.--PART I.,Who works and never swerves.
459,HONORS.--PART I.,
460,HONORS.--PART I.,"""We measure not his mind; we cannot tell"
461,HONORS.--PART I.,"What lieth under, over, or beside"
462,HONORS.--PART I.,"The test we put him to; he doth excel,"
463,HONORS.--PART I.,"We know, where he is tried;"
464,HONORS.--PART I.,
465,HONORS.--PART I.,"""But, if he boast some farther excellence--"
466,HONORS.--PART I.,Mind to create as well as to attain;
467,HONORS.--PART I.,"To sway his peers by golden eloquence,"
468,HONORS.--PART I.,As wind doth shift a fane;
469,HONORS.--PART I.,
470,HONORS.--PART I.,"""'To sing among the poets--we are nought:"
471,HONORS.--PART I.,We cannot drop a line into that sea
472,HONORS.--PART I.,"And read its fathoms off, nor gauge a thought,"
473,HONORS.--PART I.,Nor map a simile.
474,HONORS.--PART I.,
475,HONORS.--PART I.,"""'It may be of all voices sublunar"

609,HONORS.--PART II.,My well-beloved friend.
610,HONORS.--PART II.,
611,HONORS.--PART II.,There fell a flute when Ganymede went up--
612,HONORS.--PART II.,The flute that he was wont to play upon:
613,HONORS.--PART II.,"It dropped beside the jonquil's milk-white cup,"
614,HONORS.--PART II.,And freckled cowslips wan--
615,HONORS.--PART II.,
616,HONORS.--PART II.,"Dropped from his heedless hand when, dazed and mute,"
617,HONORS.--PART II.,"He sailed upon the eagle's quivering wing,"
618,HONORS.--PART II.,"Aspiring, panting--aye, it dropped--the flute"
619,HONORS.--PART II.,Erewhile a cherished thing.
620,HONORS.--PART II.,
621,HONORS.--PART II.,Among the delicate grasses and the bells
622,HONORS.--PART II.,"Of crocuses that spotted a rill side,"
623,HONORS.--PART II.,"I picked up such a flute, and its clear swells"
624,HONORS.--PART II.,To my young lips replied.
625,HONORS.--PART II.,
626,HONORS.--PART II.,"I played thereon, and its response was sweet;"
627,HONORS.--PART II.,"But lo, they took from me that solacing reed."
628,HONORS.--PART II.,"""O shame!"" they said; ""such music is not meet;"
629,HONORS.--PART II.,Go up like Ganymede.

631,HONORS.--PART II.,"""Go up, despise these humble grassy things,"

633,HONORS.--PART II.,Alas! though ne'er for me those eagle wings

635,HONORS.--PART II.,
636,HONORS.--PART II.,My flute! and flung away its echoes sleep;
637,HONORS.--PART II.,"But as for me, my life-pulse beateth low;"
638,HONORS.--PART II.,And like a last-year's leaf enshrouded deep
639,HONORS.--PART II.,"Under the drifting snow,"
640,HONORS.--PART II.,
641,HONORS.--PART II.,Or like some vessel wrecked upon the sand
642,HONORS.--PART II.,"Of torrid swamps, with all her merchandise,"
643,HONORS.--PART II.,"And left to rot betwixt the sea and land,"
644,HONORS.--PART II.,My helpless spirit lies.
645,HONORS.--PART II.,
646,HONORS.--PART II.,"Rueing, I think for what then was I made;"
647,HONORS.--PART II.,What end appointed for--what use designed?
648,HONORS.--PART II.,Now let me right this heart that was bewrayed--
649,HONORS.--PART II.,Unveil these eyes gone blind.
650,HONORS.--PART II.,
651,HONORS.--PART II.,"My well-beloved friend, at noon to-day"
652,HONORS.--PART II.,"Over our cliffs a white mist lay unfurled,"
653,HONORS.--PART II.,"So thick, one standing on their brink might say,"
654,HONORS.--PART II.,"Lo, here doth end the world."
655,HONORS.--PART II.,
656,HONORS.--PART II.,"A white abyss beneath, and nought beside;"
657,HONORS.--PART II.,"Yet, hark! a cropping sound not ten feet down:"
658,HONORS.--PART II.,Soon I could trace some browsing lambs that hied
659,HONORS.--PART II.,Through rock-paths cleft and brown.
660,HONORS.--PART II.,
661,HONORS.--PART II.,"And here and there green tufts of grass peered through,"
662,HONORS.--PART II.,"Salt lavender, and sea thrift; then behold"
663,HONORS.--PART II.,"The mist, subsiding ever, bared to view"
664,HONORS.--PART II.,A beast of giant mould.
665,HONORS.--PART II.,
666,HONORS.--PART II.,She seemed a great sea-monster lying content
667,HONORS.--PART II.,With all her cubs about her: but deep--deep--
668,HONORS.--PART II.,The subtle mist went floating; its descent
669,HONORS.--PART II.,Showed the world's end was steep.
670,HONORS.--PART II.,
671,HONORS.--PART II.,"It shook, it melted, shaking more, till, lo,"
672,HONORS.--PART II.,The sprawling monster was a rock; her brood
673,HONORS.--PART II.,"Were boulders, whereon sea-mews white as snow"
674,HONORS.--PART II.,Sat watching for their food.
675,HONORS.--PART II.,
676,HONORS.--PART II.,"Then once again it sank, its day was done:"
677,HONORS.--PART II.,"Part rolled away, part vanished utterly,"
678,HONORS.--PART II.,"And glimmering softly under the white sun,"
679,HONORS.--PART II.,Behold! a great white sea.
680,HONORS.--PART II.,
681,HONORS.--PART II.,O that the mist which veileth my To-come
682,HONORS.--PART II.,Would so dissolve and yield unto mine eyes
683,HONORS.--PART II.,A worthy path! I'd count not wearisome
684,HONORS.--PART II.,"Long toil, nor enterprise,"
685,HONORS.--PART II.,
686,HONORS.--PART II.,"But strain to reach it; ay, with wrestlings stout"
687,HONORS.--PART II.,And hopes that even in the dark will grow
688,HONORS.--PART II.,"(Like plants in dungeons, reaching feelers out),"
689,HONORS.--PART II.,And ploddings wary and slow.
690,HONORS.--PART II.,
691,HONORS.--PART II.,Is there such path already made to fit
692,HONORS.--PART II.,The measure of my foot? It shall atone
693,HONORS.--PART II.,"For much, if I at length may light on it"
694,HONORS.--PART II.,And know it for mine own.
695,HONORS.--PART II.,
696,HONORS.--PART II.,"But is there none? why, then, 'tis more than well:"
697,HONORS.--PART II.,"And glad at heart myself will hew one out,"
698,HONORS.--PART II.,"Let me he only sure; for, sooth to tell,"
699,HONORS.--PART II.,The sorest dole is doubt--
700,HONORS.--PART II.,
701,HONORS.--PART II.,"Doubt, a blank twilight of the heart, which mars"
702,HONORS.--PART II.,All sweetest colors in its dimness same;
703,HONORS.--PART II.,"A soul-mist, through whose rifts familiar stare"
704,HONORS.--PART II.,"Beholding, we misname."
705,HONORS.--PART II.,
706,HONORS.--PART II.,"A ripple on the inner sea, which shakes"
707,HONORS.--PART II.,Those images that on its breast reposed;
708,HONORS.--PART II.,"A fold upon a wind-swayed flag, that breaks"
709,HONORS.--PART II.,The motto it disclosed.
710,HONORS.--PART II.,
711,HONORS.--PART II.,O doubt! O doubt! I know my destiny;
712,HONORS.--PART II.,I feel thee fluttering bird-like in my breast;

716,HONORS.--PART II.,"There is no certainty, ""my bosom's guest,"""
717,HONORS.--PART II.,No proving for the things whereof ye wot;

720,HONORS.--PART II.,
721,HONORS.--PART II.,"But surely as they are, for God is truth,"
722,HONORS.--PART II.,"And as they are not, for we saw them die,"
723,HONORS.--PART II.,"So surely from the heaven drops light for youth,"
724,HONORS.--PART II.,If youth will walk thereby.
725,HONORS.--PART II.,
726,HONORS.--PART II.,And can I see this light? It may be so;
727,HONORS.--PART II.,"""But see it thus and thus,"" my fathers said."
728,HONORS.--PART II.,The living do not rule this world; ah no!
729,HONORS.--PART II.,"It is the dead, the dead."

733,HONORS.--PART II.,"Or learn to read my own heart's folded scroll,"
734,HONORS.--PART II.,And make self-rule my end?
735,HONORS.--PART II.,
736,HONORS.--PART II.,"Thought from _without_--O shall I take on trust,"
737,HONORS.--PART II.,And life from others modelled steal or win;
738,HONORS.--PART II.,"Or shall I heave to light, and clear of rust"
739,HONORS.--PART II.,My true life from _within_?
740,HONORS.--PART II.,
741,HONORS.--PART II.,"O, let me be myself! But where, O where,"
742,HONORS.--PART II.,"Under this heap of precedent, this mound"
743,HONORS.--PART II.,"Of customs, modes, and maxims, cumbrance rare,"
744,HONORS.--PART II.,Shall the Myself be found?
745,HONORS.--PART II.,
746,HONORS.--PART II.,"O thou _Myself_, thy fathers thee debarred"
747,HONORS.--PART II.,"None of their wisdom, but their folly came"
748,HONORS.--PART II.,"Therewith; they smoothed thy path, but made it hard"
749,HONORS.--PART II.,For thee to quit the same.
750,HONORS.--PART II.,
751,HONORS.--PART II.,"With glosses they obscured God's natural truth,"
752,HONORS.--PART II.,And with tradition tarnished His revealed;
753,HONORS.--PART II.,"With vain protections they endangered youth,"
754,HONORS.--PART II.,With layings bare they sealed.
755,HONORS.--PART II.,
756,HONORS.--PART II.,"What aileth thee, myself? Alas! thy hands"
757,HONORS.--PART II.,"Are tied with old opinions--heir and son,"
758,HONORS.--PART II.,Thou hast inherited thy father's lands
759,HONORS.--PART II.,And all his debts thereon.
760,HONORS.--PART II.,
761,HONORS.--PART II.,O that some power would give me Adam's eyes!
762,HONORS.--PART II.,O for the straight simplicity of Eve!
763,HONORS.--PART II.,"For I see nought, or grow, poor fool, too wise"
764,HONORS.--PART II.,With seeing to believe.
765,HONORS.--PART II.,
766,HONORS.--PART II.,Exemplars may be heaped until they hide
767,HONORS.--PART II.,The rules that they were made to render plain;
768,HONORS.--PART II.,"Love may be watched, her nature to decide,"
769,HONORS.--PART II.,Until love's self doth wane.
770,HONORS.--PART II.,
771,HONORS.--PART II.,Ah me! and when forgotten and foregone
772,HONORS.--PART II.,"We leave the learning of departed days,"

774,HONORS.--PART II.,"Their wisdom and their ways,--"
775,HONORS.--PART II.,
776,HONORS.--PART II.,"When fain to learn we lean into the dark,"
777,HONORS.--PART II.,"And grope to feel the floor of the abyss,"
778,HONORS.--PART II.,Or find the secret boundary lines which mark
779,HONORS.--PART II.,Where soul and matter kiss--
780,HONORS.--PART II.,
781,HONORS.--PART II.,Fair world! these puzzled souls of ours grow weak
782,HONORS.--PART II.,With beating their bruised wings against the rim
783,HONORS.--PART II.,"That bounds their utmost flying, when they seek"
784,HONORS.--PART II.,The distant and the dim.
785,HONORS.--PART II.,
786,HONORS.--PART II.,"We pant, we strain like birds against their wires;"
787,HONORS.--PART II.,Are sick to reach the vast and the beyond;--
788,HONORS.--PART II.,"And what avails, if still to our desires"

790,HONORS.--PART II.,
791,HONORS.--PART II.,Contentment comes not therefore; still there lies
792,HONORS.--PART II.,"An outer distance when the first is hailed,"

794,HONORS.--PART II.,An UTMOST--that is veiled.
795,HONORS.--PART II.,
796,HONORS.--PART II.,"Searching those edges of the universe,"
797,HONORS.--PART II.,We leave the central fields a fallow part;

799,HONORS.--PART II.,And starve the darkened heart.
800,HONORS.--PART II.,
801,HONORS.--PART II.,Then all goes wrong: the old foundations rock;
802,HONORS.--PART II.,One scorns at him of old who gazed unshod;
803,HONORS.--PART II.,One striking with a pickaxe thinks the shock

820,HONORS.--PART II.,
821,HONORS.--PART II.,"The garden, O the garden, must it go,"

831,HONORS.--PART II.,"And delving in the outworks of this world,"
832,HONORS.--PART II.,"And little crevices that it could reach,"

834,HONORS.--PART II.,"Under an ancient beach,"

836,HONORS.--PART II.,And other waifs that lay to its young mind

871,HONORS.--PART II.,"Wait, nor against the half-learned lesson fret,"

876,HONORS.--PART II.,Either the Worker did in ancient days
877,HONORS.--PART II.,"Give us the word, His tale of love and might;"
878,HONORS.--PART II.,"(And if in truth He gave it us, who says"
879,HONORS.--PART II.,He did not give it right?)
880,HONORS.--PART II.,
881,HONORS.--PART II.,"Or else He gave it not, and then indeed"
882,HONORS.--PART II.,We know not if HE is--by whom our years
883,HONORS.--PART II.,"Are portioned, who the orphan moons doth lead,"
884,HONORS.--PART II.,And the unfathered spheres.
885,HONORS.--PART II.,
886,HONORS.--PART II.,We sit unowned upon our burial sod
887,HONORS.--PART II.,"And know not whence we come or whose we be,"
888,HONORS.--PART II.,"Comfortless mourners for the mount of God,"
889,HONORS.--PART II.,The rocks of Calvary:
890,HONORS.--PART II.,
891,HONORS.--PART II.,"Bereft of heaven, and of the long-loved page"
892,HONORS.--PART II.,Wrought us by some who thought with death to cope.
893,HONORS.--PART II.,"Despairing comforters, from age to age"
894,HONORS.--PART II.,Sowing the seeds of hope:
895,HONORS.--PART II.,
896,HONORS.--PART II.,"Gracious deceivers, who have lifted us"
897,HONORS.--PART II.,Out of the slough where passed our unknown youth.
898,HONORS.--PART II.,"Beneficent liars, who have gifted us"
899,HONORS.--PART II.,With sacred love of truth!
900,HONORS.--PART II.,
901,HONORS.--PART II.,Farewell to them: yet pause ere thou unmoor
902,HONORS.--PART II.,And set thine ark adrift on unknown seas;
903,HONORS.--PART II.,"How wert thou bettered so, or more secure"
904,HONORS.--PART II.,"Thou, and thy destinies?"
905,HONORS.--PART II.,
906,HONORS.--PART II.,"And if thou searchest, and art made to fear"
907,HONORS.--PART II.,"Facing of unread riddles dark and hard,"
908,HONORS.--PART II.,"And mastering not their majesty austere,"
909,HONORS.--PART II.,Their meaning locked and barred:
910,HONORS.--PART II.,
911,HONORS.--PART II.,"How would it make the weight and wonder less,"
912,HONORS.--PART II.,"If, lifted from immortal shoulders down,"
913,HONORS.--PART II.,The worlds were cast on seas of emptiness
914,HONORS.--PART II.,In realms without a crown.
915,HONORS.--PART II.,
916,HONORS.--PART II.,And (if there were no God) were left to rue
917,HONORS.--PART II.,Dominion of the air and of the fire?
918,HONORS.--PART II.,"Then if there be a God, ""Let God be true,"
919,HONORS.--PART II.,"And every man a liar."""
920,HONORS.--PART II.,
921,HONORS.--PART II.,"But as for me, I do not speak as one"
922,HONORS.--PART II.,That is exempt: I am with life at feud:
923,HONORS.--PART II.,"My heart reproacheth me, as there were none"
924,HONORS.--PART II.,Of so small gratitude.
925,HONORS.--PART II.,
926,HONORS.--PART II.,"Wherewith shall I console thee, heart o' mine."
927,HONORS.--PART II.,And still thy yearning and resolve thy doubt?
928,HONORS.--PART II.,"That which I know, and that which I divine,"
929,HONORS.--PART II.,Alas! have left thee out.
930,HONORS.--PART II.,
931,HONORS.--PART II.,"I have aspired to know the might of God,"
932,HONORS.--PART II.,"As if the story of His love was furled,"
933,HONORS.--PART II.,Nor sacred foot the grasses e'er had trod
934,HONORS.--PART II.,Of this redeemèd world:--
935,HONORS.--PART II.,
936,HONORS.--PART II.,"Have sunk my thoughts as lead into the deep,"
937,HONORS.--PART II.,"To grope for that abyss whence evil grew,"
938,HONORS.--PART II.,"And spirits of ill, with eyes that cannot weep,"
939,HONORS.--PART II.,Hungry and desolate flew;
940,HONORS.--PART II.,
941,HONORS.--PART II.,As if their legions did not one day crowd
942,HONORS.--PART II.,The death-pangs of the Conquering Good to see!
943,HONORS.--PART II.,As if a sacred head had never bowed
944,HONORS.--PART II.,In death for man--for me;
945,HONORS.--PART II.,
946,HONORS.--PART II.,"Nor ransomed back the souls beloved, the sons"
947,HONORS.--PART II.,"Of men, from thraldom with the nether kings"
948,HONORS.--PART II.,In that dark country where those evil ones
949,HONORS.--PART II.,Trail their unhallowed wings.
950,HONORS.--PART II.,
951,HONORS.--PART II.,"And didst Thou love the race that loved not Thee,"
952,HONORS.--PART II.,And didst Thou take to heaven a human brow?
953,HONORS.--PART II.,Dost plead with man's voice by the marvellous sea?
954,HONORS.--PART II.,Art Thou his kinsman now?
955,HONORS.--PART II.,
956,HONORS.--PART II.,"O God, O kinsman loved, but not enough!"
957,HONORS.--PART II.,"O man, with eyes majestic after death,"
958,HONORS.--PART II.,"Whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough,"
959,HONORS.--PART II.,Whose lips drawn human breath!
960,HONORS.--PART II.,
961,HONORS.--PART II.,"By that one likeness which is ours and Thine,"
962,HONORS.--PART II.,"By that one nature which doth hold us kin,"
963,HONORS.--PART II.,"By that high heaven where, sinless, Thou dost shine"
964,HONORS.--PART II.,"To draw us sinners in,"
965,HONORS.--PART II.,
966,HONORS.--PART II.,"By Thy last silence in the judgment-hall,"
967,HONORS.--PART II.,"By long foreknowledge of the deadly tree,"
968,HONORS.--PART II.,"By darkness, by the wormwood and the gall,"
969,HONORS.--PART II.,I pray Thee visit me.
970,HONORS.--PART II.,
971,HONORS.--PART II.,"Come, lest this heart should, cold and cast away,"
972,HONORS.--PART II.,Die ere the guest adored she entertain--
973,HONORS.--PART II.,Lest eyes which never saw Thine earthly day
974,HONORS.--PART II.,Should miss Thy heavenly reign.
975,HONORS.--PART II.,
976,HONORS.--PART II.,"Come, weary-eyed from seeking in the night"
977,HONORS.--PART II.,"Thy wanderers strayed upon the pathless wold,"
978,HONORS.--PART II.,"Who wounded, dying, cry to Thee for light,"
979,HONORS.--PART II.,And cannot find their fold.
980,HONORS.--PART II.,
981,HONORS.--PART II.,"And deign, O Watcher, with the sleepless brow,"
982,HONORS.--PART II.,Pathetic in its yearning--deign reply:
983,HONORS.--PART II.,"Is there, O is there aught that such as Thou"
984,HONORS.--PART II.,Wouldst take from such as I?
985,HONORS.--PART II.,
986,HONORS.--PART II.,Are there no briers across Thy pathway thrust?
987,HONORS.--PART II.,Are there no thorns that compass it about?
988,HONORS.--PART II.,Nor any stones that Thou wilt deign to trust
989,HONORS.--PART II.,My hands to gather out?
990,HONORS.--PART II.,
991,HONORS.--PART II.,"O if Thou wilt, and if such bliss might be,"
992,HONORS.--PART II.,"It were a cure for doubt, regret, delay--"
993,HONORS.--PART II.,Let my lost pathway go--what aileth me?--
994,HONORS.--PART II.,There is a better way.
995,HONORS.--PART II.,
996,HONORS.--PART II.,"What though unmarked the happy workman toil,"
997,HONORS.--PART II.,And break unthanked of man the stubborn clod?
998,HONORS.--PART II.,"It is enough, for sacred is the soil,"
999,HONORS.--PART II.,Dear are the hills of God.
1000,HONORS.--PART II.,
1001,HONORS.--PART II.,Far better in its place the lowliest bird
1002,HONORS.--PART II.,"Should sing aright to Him the lowliest song,"
1003,HONORS.--PART II.,Than that a seraph strayed should take the word
1004,HONORS.--PART II.,And sing His glory wrong.
1005,HONORS.--PART II.,
1006,HONORS.--PART II.,"Friend, it is time to work. I say to thee,"
1007,HONORS.--PART II.,Thou dost all earthly good by much excel;

1014,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!
1015,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1016,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1017,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,My heart is sick awishing and awaiting:
1018,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"The lad took up his knapsack, he went, he went his way;"
1019,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And I looked on for his coming, as a prisoner through the grating"
1020,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,Looks and longs and longs and wishes for its opening day.
1021,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1022,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"On the wild purple mountains, all alone with no other,"
1023,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"The strong terrible mountains he longed, he longed to be;"
1024,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And he stooped to kiss his father, and he stooped to kiss his mother,"
1025,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And till I said, ""Adieu, sweet Sir,"" he quite forgot me."
1026,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1027,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"He wrote of their white raiment, the ghostly capes that screen them,"
1028,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Of the storm winds that beat them, their thunder-rents and scars,"
1029,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And the paradise of purple, and the golden slopes atween them,"
1030,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And fields, where grow God's gentian bells, and His crocus stars."
1031,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1032,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"He wrote of frail gauzy clouds, that drop on them like fleeces,"
1033,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And make green their fir forests, and feed their mosses hoar;"
1034,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Or come sailing up the valleys, and get wrecked and go to pieces,"
1035,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,Like sloops against their cruel strength: then he wrote no more.
1036,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1037,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"O the silence that came next, the patience and long aching!"
1038,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"They never said so much as ""He was a dear loved son;"""
1039,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Not the father to the mother moaned, that dreary stillness breaking:"
1040,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""Ah! wherefore did he leave us so--this, our only one."""
1041,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1042,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"They sat within, as waiting, until the neighbors prayed them,"
1043,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"At Cromer, by the sea-coast, 'twere peace and change to be;"
1044,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And to Cromer, in their patience, or that urgency affrayed them,"
1045,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Or because the tidings tarried, they came, and took me."
1046,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1047,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,It was three months and over since the dear lad had started:
1048,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,On the green downs at Cromer I sat to see the view;
1049,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"On an open space of herbage, where the ling and fern had parted,"
1050,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Betwixt the tall white lighthouse towers, the old and the new."
1051,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1052,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Below me lay the wide sea, the scarlet sun was stooping,"
1053,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And he dyed the waste water, as with a scarlet dye;"
1054,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,And he dyed the lighthouse towers; every bird with white wing swooping
1055,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Took his colors, and the cliffs did, and the yawning sky."
1056,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1057,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Over grass came that strange flush, and over ling and heather,"
1058,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Over flocks of sheep and lambs, and over Cromer town;"
1059,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,And each filmy cloudlet crossing drifted like a scarlet feather
1060,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Torn from the folded wings of clouds, while he settled down."
1061,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1062,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"When I looked, I dared not sigh:--In the light of God's splendor,"
1063,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"With His daily blue and gold, who am I? what am I?"
1064,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"But that passion and outpouring seemed an awful sign and tender,"
1065,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Like the blood of the Redeemer, shown on earth and sky."
1066,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1067,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"O for comfort, O the waste of a long doubt and trouble!"
1068,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,On that sultry August eve trouble had made me meek;
1069,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"I was tired of my sorrow--O so faint, for it was double"
1070,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"In the weight of its oppression, that I could not speak!"
1071,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1072,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And a little comfort grew, while the dimmed eyes were feeding,"
1073,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,And the dull ears with murmur of water satisfied;
1074,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"But a dream came slowly nigh me, all my thoughts and fancy leading"
1075,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,Across the bounds of waking life to the other side.
1076,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1077,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And I dreamt that I looked out, to the waste waters turning,"
1078,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,And saw the flakes of scarlet from wave to wave tossed on;
1079,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And the scarlet mix with azure, where a heap of gold lay burning"
1080,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,On the clear remote sea reaches; for the sun was gone.
1081,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1082,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,Then I thought a far-off shout dropped across the still water--
1083,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"A question as I took it, for soon an answer came"
1084,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"From the tall white ruined lighthouse: ""If it be the old man's daughter"
1085,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"That we wot of,"" ran the answer, ""what then--who's to blame?"""
1086,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1087,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,I looked up at the lighthouse all roofless and storm-broken:
1088,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"A great white bird sat on it, with neck stretched out to sea;"
1089,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Unto somewhat which was sailing in a skiff the bird had spoken,"
1090,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And a trembling seized my spirit, for they talked of me."
1091,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1092,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"I was the old man's daughter, the bird went on to name him;"
1093,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""He loved to count the starlings as he sat in the sun;"
1094,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Long ago he served with Nelson, and his story did not shame him:"
1095,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Ay, the old man was a good man--and his work was done."""
1096,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1097,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"The skiff was like a crescent, ghost of some moon departed,"
1098,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Frail, white, she rocked and curtseyed as the red wave she crossed,"
1099,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And the thing within sat paddling, and the crescent dipped and darted,"
1100,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Flying on, again was shouting, but the words were lost."
1101,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1102,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"I said, ""That thing is hooded; I could hear but that floweth"
1103,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"The great hood below its mouth:"" then the bird made reply."
1104,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""If they know not, more's the pity, for the little shrew-mouse knoweth,"
1105,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And the kite knows, and the eagle, and the glead and pye."""
1106,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1107,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,And he stooped to whet his beak on the stones of the coping;
1108,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And when once more the shout came, in querulous tones he spake,"
1109,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""What I said was 'more's the pity;' if the heart be long past hoping,"
1110,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Let it say of death, 'I know it,' or doubt on and break."
1111,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1112,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""Men must die--one dies by day, and near him moans his mother,"
1113,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"They dig his grave, tread it down, and go from it full loth:"
1114,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And one dies about the midnight, and the wind moans, and no other,"
1115,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,And the snows give him a burial--and God loves them both.
1116,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1117,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""The first hath no advantage--it shall not soothe his slumber"
1118,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,That a lock of his brown hair his father aye shall keep;
1119,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"For the last, he nothing grudgeth, it shall nought his quiet cumber,"
1120,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,That in a golden mesh of HIS callow eaglets sleep.
1121,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1122,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""Men must die when all is said, e'en the kite and glead know it,"
1123,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And the lad's father knew it, and the lad, the lad too;"
1124,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"It was never kept a secret, waters bring it and winds blow it,"
1125,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And he met it on the mountain--why then make ado?"""
1126,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1127,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"With that he spread his white wings, and swept across the water,"
1128,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Lit upon the hooded head, and it and all went down;"
1129,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And they laughed as they went under, and I woke, ""the old man's daughter."""
1130,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And looked across the slope of grass, and at Cromer town."
1131,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1132,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And I said, ""Is that the sky, all gray and silver-suited?"""
1133,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And I thought, ""Is that the sea that lies so white and wan?"
1134,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,I have dreamed as I remember: give me time--I was reputed
1135,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Once to have a steady courage--O, I fear 'tis gone!"""
1136,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1137,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And I said, ""Is this my heart? if it be, low 'tis beating"
1138,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"So he lies on the mountain, hard by the eagles' brood;"
1139,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"I have had a dream this evening, while the white and gold were fleeting,"
1140,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"But I need not, need not tell it--where would be the good?"
1141,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1142,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"""Where would be the good to them, his father and his mother?"
1143,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,For the ghost of their dead hope appeareth to them still.
1144,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"While a lonely watch-fire smoulders, who its dying red would smother,"
1145,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"That gives what little light there is to a darksome hill?"""
1146,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1147,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"I rose up, I made no moan, I did not cry nor falter,"
1148,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,But slowly in the twilight I came to Cromer town.
1149,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,What can wringing of the hands do that which is ordained to alter?
1150,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"He had climbed, had climbed the mountain, he would ne'er come down."
1151,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1152,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"But, O my first, O my best, I could not choose but love thee:"
1153,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"O, to be a wild white bird, and seek thy rocky bed!"
1154,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"From my breast I'd give thee burial, pluck the down and spread above thee;"
1155,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,I would sit and sing thy requiem on the mountain head.
1156,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1157,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Fare thee well, my love of loves! would I had died before thee!"
1158,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"O, to be at least a cloud, that near thee I might flow,"
1159,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"Solemnly approach the mountain, weep away my being o'er thee,"
1160,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,"And veil thy breast with icicles, and thy brow with snow!"
1161,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,
1162,REQUIESCAT IN PACE!,

1225,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,[_Mother sings to the infant_.]
1226,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1227,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Playing on the virginals,"
1228,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Who but I? Sae glad, sae free,"
1229,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Smelling for all cordials,"
1230,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,The green mint and marjorie;
1231,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Set among the budding broom,"
1232,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Kingcup and daffodilly;
1233,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,By my side I made him room:
1234,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,O love my Willie!
1235,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1236,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"""Like me, love me, girl o' gowd,"""
1237,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Sang he to my nimble strain;
1238,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Sweet his ruddy lips o'erflowed
1239,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Till my heartstrings rang again:
1240,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"By the broom, the bonny broom,"
1241,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Kingcup and daffodilly,"
1242,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,In my heart I made him room:
1243,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,O love my Willie!
1244,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1245,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"""Pipe and play, dear heart,"" sang he,"
1246,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"""I must go, yet pipe and play;"
1247,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Soon I'll come and ask of thee
1248,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"For an answer yea or nay;"""
1249,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And I waited till the flocks
1250,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Panted in yon waters stilly,"
1251,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And the corn stood in the shocks:
1252,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,O love my Willie!
1253,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1254,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,I thought first when thou didst come
1255,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"I would wear the ring for thee,"
1256,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"But the year told out its sum,"
1257,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Ere again thou sat'st by me;
1258,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Thou hadst nought to ask that day
1259,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,By kingcup and daffodilly;
1260,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,I said neither yea nor nay:
1261,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,O love my Willie!
1262,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1263,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_Enter_ GEORGE.
1264,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1265,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_George_. Well, mother, 'tis a fortnight now, or more,"
1266,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Since I set eyes on you.
1267,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1268,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_M._             Ay, George, my dear,"
1269,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,I reckon you've been busy: so have we.
1270,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1271,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_G._ And how does father?
1272,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1273,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_M._                     He gets through his work.
1274,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"But he grows stiff, a little stiff, my dear;"
1275,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"He's not so young, you know, by twenty years"
1276,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"As I am--not so young by twenty years,"
1277,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And I'm past sixty.
1278,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1279,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_G._         Yet he's hale and stout,"
1280,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And seems to take a pleasure in his pipe;
1281,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And seems to take a pleasure in his cows,"
1282,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And a pride, too."
1283,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1284,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_M._       And well he may, my dear."
1285,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1286,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_G._ Give me the little one, he tires your arm,"
1287,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"He's such a kicking, crowing, wakeful rogue,"
1288,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,He almost wears our lives out with his noise
1289,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Just at day-dawning, when we wish to sleep."
1290,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"What! you young villain, would you clench your fist"
1291,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"In father's curls? a dusty father, sure,"
1292,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And you're as clean as wax.
1293,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Ay, you may laugh;"
1294,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"But if you live a seven years more or so,"
1295,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,These hands of yours will all be brown and scratched
1296,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,With climbing after nest-eggs. They'll go down
1297,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,As many rat-holes as are round the mere;
1298,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And you'll love mud, all manner of mud and dirt,"
1299,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"As your father did afore you, and you'll wade"
1300,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,After young water-birds; and you'll get bogged
1301,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Setting of eel-traps, and you'll spoil your clothes,"
1302,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And come home torn and dripping: then, you know,"
1303,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"You'll feel the stick--you'll feel the stick, my lad!"
1304,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1305,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_Enter FRANCES._
1306,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1307,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_F._ You should not talk so to the blessed babe--
1308,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"How can you, George? why, he may be in heaven"
1309,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Before the time you tell of.
1310,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1311,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_M._                  Look at him:
1312,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"So earnest, such an eager pair of eyes!"
1313,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"He thrives, my dear."
1314,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1315,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_F._          Yes, that he does, thank God"
1316,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,My children are all strong.
1317,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1318,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_M._                 'Tis much to say;
1319,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Sick children fret their mother's hearts to shreds,"
1320,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And do no credit to their keep nor care.
1321,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Where is your little lass?
1322,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1323,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_F._                Your daughter came
1324,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And begged her of us for a week or so.
1325,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1326,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_M._ Well, well, she might be wiser, that she might,"
1327,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,For she can sit at ease and pay her way;
1328,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"A sober husband, too--a cheerful man--"
1329,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Honest as ever stepped, and fond of her;"
1330,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Yet she is never easy, never glad,"
1331,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Because she has not children. Well-a-day!
1332,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"If she could know how hard her mother worked,"
1333,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And what ado I had, and what a moil"
1334,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"With my half-dozen! Children, ay, forsooth,"
1335,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"They bring their own love with them when they come,"
1336,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,But if they come not there is peace and rest;
1337,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,The pretty lambs! and yet she cries for more:
1338,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Why the world's full of them, and so is heaven--"
1339,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,They are not rare.
1340,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1341,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_G._          No, mother, not at all;"
1342,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,But Hannah must not keep our Fanny long--
1343,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,She spoils her.
1344,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1345,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_M._     Ah! folks spoil their children now;
1346,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,When I was a young woman 'twas not so;
1347,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"We made our children fear us, made them work,"
1348,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Kept them in order.
1349,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1350,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_G._         Were not proud of them--
1351,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Eh, mother?"
1352,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1353,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_M._   I set store by mine, 'tis true,"
1354,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,But then I had good cause.
1355,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1356,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_G._                My lad, d'ye hear?"
1357,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Your Granny was not proud, by no means proud!"
1358,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"She never spoilt your father--no, not she,"
1359,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Nor ever made him sing at harvest-home,"
1360,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Nor at the forge, nor at the baker's shop,"
1361,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Nor to the doctor while she lay abed
1362,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Sick, and he crept upstairs to share her broth."
1363,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1364,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_M._ Well, well, you were my youngest, and, what's more"
1365,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Your father loved to hear you sing--he did,"
1366,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Although, good man, he could not tell one tune"
1367,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,From the other.
1368,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1369,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_F._     No, he got his voice from you:"
1370,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Do use it, George, and send the child to sleep."
1371,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1372,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_G._ What must I sing?
1373,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1374,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_F._                   The ballad of the man
1375,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,That is so shy he cannot speak his mind.
1376,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1377,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_G._ Ay, of the purple grapes and crimson leaves;"
1378,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"But, mother, put your shawl and bonnet off."
1379,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And, Frances, lass, I brought some cresses in:"
1380,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Just wash them, toast the bacon, break some eggs,"
1381,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And let's to supper shortly.
1382,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1383,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,[_Sings._]
1384,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1385,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,My neighbor White--we met to-day--
1386,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"He always had a cheerful way,"
1387,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,As if he breathed at ease;
1388,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"My neighbor White lives down the glade,"
1389,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And I live higher, in the shade"
1390,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Of my old walnut-trees.
1391,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1392,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"So many lads and lasses small,"
1393,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"To feed them all, to clothe them all,"
1394,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Must surely tax his wit;
1395,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"I see his thatch when I look out,"
1396,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"His branching roses creep about,"
1397,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And vines half smother it.
1398,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1399,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"There white-haired urchins climb his eaves,"
1400,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And little watch-fires heap with leaves,"
1401,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And milky filberts hoard;
1402,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And there his oldest daughter stands
1403,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,With downcast eyes and skilful hands
1404,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Before her ironing-board.
1405,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1406,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"She comforts all her mother's days,"
1407,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And with her sweet obedient ways
1408,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,She makes her labor light;
1409,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"So sweet to hear, so fair to see!"
1410,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"O, she is much too good for me,"
1411,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,That lovely Lettice White!
1412,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1413,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,'Tis hard to feel one's self a fool!
1414,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,With that same lass I went to school--
1415,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,I then was great and wise;
1416,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"She read upon an easier book,"
1417,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And I--I never cared to look
1418,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Into her shy blue eyes.
1419,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1420,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And now I know they must be there
1421,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Sweet eyes, behind those lashes fair"
1422,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,That will not raise their rim:
1423,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"If maids be shy, he cures who can;"
1424,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,But if a man be shy--a man--
1425,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Why then the worse for him!
1426,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1427,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"My mother cries, ""For such a lad"
1428,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,A wife is easy to be had
1429,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And always to be found;
1430,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"A finer scholar scarce can be,"
1431,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And for a foot and leg,"" says she,"
1432,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"""He beats the country round!"
1433,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1434,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"""My handsome boy must stoop his head"
1435,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"To clear her door whom he would wed."""
1436,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Weak praise, but fondly sung!"
1437,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"""O mother! scholars sometimes fail--"
1438,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And what can foot and leg avail
1439,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"To him that wants a tongue?"""
1440,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1441,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"When by her ironing-board I sit,"
1442,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Her little sisters round me flit,"
1443,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And bring me forth their store;
1444,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Dark cluster grapes of dusty blue,"
1445,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And small sweet apples bright of hue
1446,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And crimson to the core.
1447,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1448,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"But she abideth silent, fair,"
1449,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,All shaded by her flaxen hair
1450,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,The blushes come and go;
1451,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"I look, and I no more can speak"
1452,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Than the red sun that on her cheek
1453,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Smiles as he lieth low.
1454,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1455,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Sometimes the roses by the latch
1456,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Or scarlet vine-leaves from her thatch
1457,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Come sailing down like birds;
1458,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"When from their drifts her board I clear,"
1459,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"She thanks me, but I scarce can hear"
1460,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,The shyly uttered words.
1461,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1462,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Oft have I wooed sweet Lettice White
1463,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,By daylight and by candlelight
1464,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,When we two were apart.
1465,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Some better day come on apace,"
1466,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And let me tell her face to face,"
1467,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"""Maiden, thou hast my heart."""
1468,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1469,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,How gently rock yon poplars high
1470,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Against the reach of primrose sky
1471,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,With heaven's pale candles stored!
1472,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"She sees them all, sweet Lettice White;"
1473,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,I'll e'en go sit again to-night
1474,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Beside her ironing-board!
1475,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1476,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Why, you young rascal! who would think it, now?"
1477,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,No sooner do I stop than you look up.
1478,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,What would you have your poor old father do?
1479,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"'Twas a brave song, long-winded, and not loud."
1480,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1481,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_M._ He heard the bacon sputter on the fork,"
1482,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And heard his mother's step across the floor.
1483,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Where did you get that song?--'tis new to me.
1484,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1485,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_G._  I bought it of a peddler.
1486,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1487,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_M._                          Did you so?
1488,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Well, you were always for the love-songs, George."
1489,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1490,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_F._ My dear, just lay his head upon your arm."
1491,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And if you'll pace and sing two minutes more
1492,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,He needs must sleep--his eyes are full of sleep.
1493,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1494,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_G._ Do you sing, mother."
1495,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1496,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_F._                      Ay, good mother, do;"
1497,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,'Tis long since we have heard you.
1498,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1499,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,_M._                        Like enough;
1500,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"I'm an old woman, and the girls and lads"
1501,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,I used to sing to sleep o'ertop me now.
1502,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,What should I sing for?
1503,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1504,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_G._             Why, to pleasure us."
1505,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Sing in the chimney corner, where you sit,"
1506,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And I'll pace gently with the little one.
1507,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1508,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,[_Mother sings._]

1513,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And a scarlet sun doth rise;
1514,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Like a scarlet fleece the snow-field spreads,"
1515,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And the icy founts run free,"
1516,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And the bergs begin to bow their heads,"
1517,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"And plunge, and sail in the sea."
1518,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1519,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"O my lost love, and my own, own love,"
1520,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And my love that loved me so!
1521,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Is there never a chink in the world above
1522,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Where they listen for words from below?
1523,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Nay, I spoke once, and I grieved thee sore,"
1524,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"I remember all that I said,"
1525,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And now thou wilt hear me no more--no more

1527,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1528,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Thou didst set thy foot on the ship, and sail"
1529,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,To the ice-fields and the snow;
1530,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Thou wert sad, for thy love did not avail,"
1531,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,And the end I could not know;
1532,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"How could I tell I should love thee to-day,"
1533,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Whom that day I held not dear?
1534,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,How could I know I should love thee away
1535,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,When I did not love thee anear?
1536,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1537,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,We shall walk no more through the sodden plain
1538,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"With the faded bents o'erspread,"
1539,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,We shall stand no more by the seething main
1540,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,While the dark wrack drives overhead;
1541,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"We shall part no more in the wind and the rain,"
1542,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,Where thy last farewell was said;
1543,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,But perhaps I shall meet thee and know thee again
1544,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,When the sea gives up her dead.
1545,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,
1546,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"_F._ Asleep at last, and time he was, indeed."
1547,SUPPER AT THE MILL.,"Turn back the cradle-quilt, and lay him in;"

1737,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"""And reason on: 'We take the spoil;"

1747,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"With that she slept again, my heart,"

1750,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,With open velvet butterflies
1751,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"That swung and spread their peacock eyes,"
1752,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,As if they cared no more to rise
1753,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,From off their beds of camomile.
1754,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1755,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"The blackcaps in an orchard met,"
1756,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Praising the berries while they ate:
1757,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,The finch that flew her beak to whet
1758,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Before she joined them on the tree;
1759,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,The water mouse among the reeds--
1760,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"His bright eyes glancing black as beads,"
1761,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,So happy with a bunch of seeds--
1762,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,I felt their gladness heartily.
1763,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1764,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"But I came on, I smelt the hay,"
1765,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And up the hills I took my way,"
1766,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And down them still made holiday,"
1767,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And walked, and wearied not a whit;"
1768,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,But ever with the lane I went
1769,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Until it dropped with steep descent,"
1770,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Cut deep into the rock, a tent"

1772,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1773,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Adown the rock small runlets wept,"
1774,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And reckless ivies leaned and crept,"

1776,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,On its brown steeps and made them fair;
1777,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And broader beams athwart it shot,"
1778,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Where martins cheeped in many a knot,"
1779,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,For they had ta'en a sandy plot
1780,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,And scooped another Petra there.
1781,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1782,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And deeper down, hemmed in and hid"

1784,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"The swallows gossiping, I thrid"
1785,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Its mazes, till the dipping land"
1786,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Sank to the level of my lane.
1787,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"That was the last hill of the chain,"
1788,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,And fair below I saw the plain
1789,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,That seemed cold cheer to reprimand.
1790,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1791,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Half-drowned in sleepy peace it lay,"
1792,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,As satiate with the boundless play
1793,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Of sunshine in its green array.
1794,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And clear-cut hills of gloomy blue,"
1795,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"To keep it safe rose up behind,"
1796,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,As with a charmèd ring to bind
1797,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"The grassy sea, where clouds might find"
1798,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,A place to bring their shadows to.
1799,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,

1808,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1809,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"But, lo! I reached a field of wheat,"
1810,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,And by its gate full clear and sweet
1811,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"A workman sang, while at his feet"
1812,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Played a young child, all life and stir--"
1813,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"A three years' child, with rosy lip,"
1814,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Who in the song had partnership,"
1815,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Made happy with each falling chip
1816,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Dropped by the busy carpenter.
1817,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1818,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"This, reared a new gate for the old,"
1819,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And loud the tuneful measure rolled,"
1820,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,But stopped as I came up to hold
1821,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Some kindly talk of passing things.
1822,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Brave were his eyes, and frank his mien;"
1823,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Of all men's faces, calm or keen,"
1824,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,A better I have never seen

1826,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1827,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And how it was I scarce can tell,"
1828,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,We seemed to please each other well;
1829,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,I lingered till a noonday bell
1830,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Had sounded, and his task was done."
1831,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,An oak had screened us from the heat;
1832,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And 'neath it in the standing wheat,"
1833,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"A cradle and a fair retreat,"
1834,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Full sweetly slept the little one.
1835,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1836,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"The workman rested from his stroke,"
1837,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And manly were the words he spoke,"
1838,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Until the smiling babe awoke
1839,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,And prayed to him for milk and food.
1840,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Then to a runlet forth he went,"
1841,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And brought a wallet from the bent,"
1842,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And bade me to the meal, intent"

1849,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Saving this child; and I may say
1850,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"That I am rich, for every day"

1852,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And to such eating condescend."""
1853,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1854,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,We ate. The child--child fair to see--
1855,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Began to cling about his knee,"
1856,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,And he down leaning fatherly
1857,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Received some softly-prattled prayer;
1858,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"He smiled as if to list were balm,"
1859,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,And with his labor-hardened palm
1860,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Pushed from the baby-forehead calm
1861,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,Those shining locks that clustered there.
1862,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1863,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,The rosy mouth made fresh essay--
1864,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"""O would he sing, or would he play?"""

1870,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Although I set great store by him."""
1871,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,
1872,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"With that, as if his heart was fain"

1893,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,One Sunday morn. By next day's light
1894,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"Her little babe was born and dead,"
1895,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"And she, unconscious what she said,"
1896,SCHOLAR AND CARPENTER.,"With feeble hands about her spread,"

3137,ABSENT.,
3138,ABSENT.,We sat on grassy slopes that meet
3139,ABSENT.,With sudden dip the level strand;
3140,ABSENT.,The trees hung overhead--our feet
3141,ABSENT.,Were on the sand.
3142,ABSENT.,
3143,ABSENT.,"Two silent girls, a thoughtful man,"
3144,ABSENT.,"We sunned ourselves in open light,"
3145,ABSENT.,And felt such April airs as fan
3146,ABSENT.,The Isle of Wight;
3147,ABSENT.,
3148,ABSENT.,And smelt the wall-flower in the crag
3149,ABSENT.,"Whereon that dainty waft had fed,"
3150,ABSENT.,Which made the bell-hung cowslip wag
3151,ABSENT.,Her delicate head;
3152,ABSENT.,
3153,ABSENT.,And let alighting jackdaws fleet
3154,ABSENT.,"Adown it open-winged, and pass"
3155,ABSENT.,Till they could touch with outstretched feet
3156,ABSENT.,The warmèd grass.
3157,ABSENT.,
3158,ABSENT.,The happy wave ran up and rang
3159,ABSENT.,"Like service bells a long way off,"
3160,ABSENT.,And down a little freshet sprang
3161,ABSENT.,"From mossy trough,"
3162,ABSENT.,
3163,ABSENT.,"And splashed into a rain of spray,"
3164,ABSENT.,"And fretted on with daylight's loss,"
3165,ABSENT.,Because so many bluebells lay
3166,ABSENT.,Leaning across.
3167,ABSENT.,
3168,ABSENT.,"Blue martins gossiped in the sun,"
3169,ABSENT.,"And pairs of chattering daws flew by,"
3170,ABSENT.,And sailing brigs rocked softly on
3171,ABSENT.,In company.
3172,ABSENT.,
3173,ABSENT.,"Wild cherry-boughs above us spread,"
3174,ABSENT.,"The whitest shade was ever seen,"
3175,ABSENT.,"And flicker, flicker, came and fled"
3176,ABSENT.,Sun spots between.
3177,ABSENT.,
3178,ABSENT.,"Bees murmured in the milk-white bloom,"
3179,ABSENT.,As babes will sigh for deep content
3180,ABSENT.,"When their sweet hearts for peace make room,"
3181,ABSENT.,"As given, not lent."
3182,ABSENT.,
3183,ABSENT.,"And we saw on: we said no word,"
3184,ABSENT.,"And one was lost in musings rare,"
3185,ABSENT.,One buoyant as the waft that stirred
3186,ABSENT.,Her shining hair.
3187,ABSENT.,
3188,ABSENT.,"His eyes were bent upon the sand,"
3189,ABSENT.,Unfathomed deeps within them lay.
3190,ABSENT.,A slender rod was in his hand--
3191,ABSENT.,A hazel spray.
3192,ABSENT.,
3193,ABSENT.,"Her eyes were resting on his face,"
3194,ABSENT.,"As shyly glad, by stealth to glean"
3195,ABSENT.,Impressions of his manly grace
3196,ABSENT.,And guarded mien;
3197,ABSENT.,
3198,ABSENT.,"The mouth with steady sweetness set,"
3199,ABSENT.,And eyes conveying unaware
3200,ABSENT.,The distant hint of some regret
3201,ABSENT.,That harbored there.
3202,ABSENT.,
3203,ABSENT.,"She gazed, and in the tender flush"
3204,ABSENT.,"That made her face like roses blown,"
3205,ABSENT.,"And in the radiance and the hush,"
3206,ABSENT.,Her thought was shown.
3207,ABSENT.,
3208,ABSENT.,It was a happy thing to sit
3209,ABSENT.,"So near, nor mar his reverie;"
3210,ABSENT.,"She looked not for a part in it,"
3211,ABSENT.,So meek was she.
3212,ABSENT.,
3213,ABSENT.,"But it was solace for her eyes,"
3214,ABSENT.,"And for her heart, that yearned to him,"
3215,ABSENT.,To watch apart in loving wise
3216,ABSENT.,Those musings dim.
3217,ABSENT.,
3218,ABSENT.,"Lost--lost, and gone! The Pelham woods"
3219,ABSENT.,Were full of doves that cooed at ease;
3220,ABSENT.,The orchis filled her purple hoods
3221,ABSENT.,For dainty bees.
3222,ABSENT.,
3223,ABSENT.,He heard not; all the delicate air
3224,ABSENT.,Was fresh with falling water-spray:
3225,ABSENT.,"It mattered not--he was not there,"
3226,ABSENT.,But far away.
3227,ABSENT.,
3228,ABSENT.,"Till with the hazel in his hand,"
3229,ABSENT.,Still drowned in thought it thus befell;
3230,ABSENT.,He drew a letter on the sand--
3231,ABSENT.,The letter L.
3232,ABSENT.,
3233,ABSENT.,"And looking on it, straight there wrought"
3234,ABSENT.,A ruddy flush about his brow;
3235,ABSENT.,His letter woke him: absent thought
3236,ABSENT.,Rushed homeward now.
3237,ABSENT.,
3238,ABSENT.,"And half-abashed, his hasty touch"
3239,ABSENT.,"Effaced it with a tell-tale care,"
3240,ABSENT.,"As if his action had been much,"
3241,ABSENT.,And not his air.
3242,ABSENT.,
3243,ABSENT.,And she? she watched his open palm
3244,ABSENT.,"Smooth out the letter from the sand,"
3245,ABSENT.,"And rose, with aspect almost calm,"
3246,ABSENT.,And filled her hand
3247,ABSENT.,
3248,ABSENT.,"With cherry-bloom, and moved away"
3249,ABSENT.,"To gather wild forget-me-not,"
3250,ABSENT.,And let her errant footsteps stray
3251,ABSENT.,"To one sweet spot,"
3252,ABSENT.,
3253,ABSENT.,As if she coveted the fair
3254,ABSENT.,"White lining of the silver-weed,"
3255,ABSENT.,And cuckoo-pint that shaded there
3256,ABSENT.,Empurpled seed.
3257,ABSENT.,
3258,ABSENT.,"She had not feared, as I divine,"
3259,ABSENT.,Because she had not hoped. Alas!
3260,ABSENT.,The sorrow of it! for that sign
3261,ABSENT.,Came but to pass;
3262,ABSENT.,
3263,ABSENT.,And yet it robbed her of the right
3264,ABSENT.,"To give, who looked not to receive,"
3265,ABSENT.,And made her blush in love's despite
3266,ABSENT.,That she should grieve.
3267,ABSENT.,
3268,ABSENT.,"A shape in white, she turned to gaze;"
3269,ABSENT.,"Her eyes were shaded with her hand,"
3270,ABSENT.,And half-way up the winding ways
3271,ABSENT.,We saw her stand.
3272,ABSENT.,
3273,ABSENT.,"Green hollows of the fringèd cliff,"
3274,ABSENT.,"Red rocks that under waters show,"
3275,ABSENT.,"Blue reaches, and a sailing skiff,"
3276,ABSENT.,Were spread below.
3277,ABSENT.,
3278,ABSENT.,"She stood to gaze, perhaps to sigh,"
3279,ABSENT.,Perhaps to think; but who can tell
3280,ABSENT.,How heavy on her heart must lie
3281,ABSENT.,The letter L!
3282,ABSENT.,
3283,ABSENT.,*       *       *       *       *
3284,ABSENT.,
3285,ABSENT.,She came anon with quiet grace;
3286,ABSENT.,"And ""What,"" she murmured, ""silent yet!"""
3287,ABSENT.,"He answered, ""'Tis a haunted place,"
3288,ABSENT.,And spell-beset.
3289,ABSENT.,
3290,ABSENT.,"""O speak to us, and break the spell!"""
3291,ABSENT.,"""The spell is broken,"" she replied."
3292,ABSENT.,"""I crossed the running brook, it fell,"
3293,ABSENT.,It could not bide.
3294,ABSENT.,
3295,ABSENT.,"""And I have brought a budding world,"
3296,ABSENT.,"Of orchis spires and daisies rank,"
3297,ABSENT.,"And ferny plumes but half uncurled,"
3298,ABSENT.,From yonder bank;
3299,ABSENT.,
3300,ABSENT.,"""And I shall weave of them a crown,"
3301,ABSENT.,"And at the well-head launch it free,"
3302,ABSENT.,"That so the brook may float it down,"
3303,ABSENT.,And out to sea.
3304,ABSENT.,
3305,ABSENT.,"""There may it to some English hands"
3306,ABSENT.,From fairy meadow seem to come;
3307,ABSENT.,The fairyest of fairy lands--
3308,ABSENT.,"The land of home."""
3309,ABSENT.,
3310,ABSENT.,"""Weave on,"" he said, and as she wove"
3311,ABSENT.,"We told how currents in the deep,"
3312,ABSENT.,"With branches from a lemon grove,"
3313,ABSENT.,Blue bergs will sweep.
3314,ABSENT.,
3315,ABSENT.,And messages from shipwrecked folk
3316,ABSENT.,"Will navigate the moon-led main,"
3317,ABSENT.,And painted boards of splintered oak
3318,ABSENT.,Their port regain.
3319,ABSENT.,
3320,ABSENT.,"Then floated out by vagrant thought,"
3321,ABSENT.,My soul beheld on torrid sand
3322,ABSENT.,The wasteful water set at nought
3323,ABSENT.,"Man's skilful hand,"
3324,ABSENT.,
3325,ABSENT.,"And suck out gold-dust from the box,"
3326,ABSENT.,"And wash it down in weedy whirls,"
3327,ABSENT.,"And split the wine-keg on the rocks,"
3328,ABSENT.,And lose the pearls.
3329,ABSENT.,
3330,ABSENT.,"""Ah! why to that which needs it not,"""
3331,ABSENT.,"Methought, ""should costly things be given?"
3332,ABSENT.,"How much is wasted, wrecked, forgot,"
3333,ABSENT.,"On this side heaven!"""
3334,ABSENT.,
3335,ABSENT.,"So musing, did mine ears awake"
3336,ABSENT.,"To maiden tones of sweet reserve,"
3337,ABSENT.,And manly speech that seemed to make
3338,ABSENT.,The steady curve
3339,ABSENT.,
3340,ABSENT.,Of lips that uttered it defer
3341,ABSENT.,"Their guard, and soften for the thought:"
3342,ABSENT.,"She listened, and his talk with her"
3343,ABSENT.,Was fancy fraught.
3344,ABSENT.,
3345,ABSENT.,"""There is not much in liberty""--"
3346,ABSENT.,With doubtful pauses he began;
3347,ABSENT.,"And said to her and said to me,"
3348,ABSENT.,"""There was a man--"
3349,ABSENT.,
3350,ABSENT.,"""There was a man who dreamed one night"
3351,ABSENT.,That his dead father came to him;
3352,ABSENT.,"And said, when fire was low, and light"
3353,ABSENT.,Was burning dim--
3354,ABSENT.,
3355,ABSENT.,"""'Why vagrant thus, my sometime pride,"
3356,ABSENT.,"Unloved, unloving, wilt thou roam?"
3357,ABSENT.,"Sure home is best!' The son replied,"
3358,ABSENT.,'I have no home.'
3359,ABSENT.,
3360,ABSENT.,"""'Shall not I speak?' his father said,"
3361,ABSENT.,"'Who early chose a youthful wife,"
3362,ABSENT.,"And worked for her, and with her led"
3363,ABSENT.,My happy life.
3364,ABSENT.,
3365,ABSENT.,"""'Ay, I will speak, for I was young"
3366,ABSENT.,"As thou art now, when I did hold"
3367,ABSENT.,The prattling sweetness of thy tongue
3368,ABSENT.,Dearer than gold;
3369,ABSENT.,
3370,ABSENT.,"""'And rosy from thy noonday sleep"
3371,ABSENT.,"Would bear thee to admiring kin,"
3372,ABSENT.,And all thy pretty looks would keep
3373,ABSENT.,My heart within.
3374,ABSENT.,
3375,ABSENT.,"""'Then after, mid thy young allies--"
3376,ABSENT.,For thee ambition flushed my brow--
3377,ABSENT.,I coveted the school-boy prize
3378,ABSENT.,Far more than thou.
3379,ABSENT.,
3380,ABSENT.,"""'I thought for thee, I thought for all"
3381,ABSENT.,My gamesome imps that round me grew;
3382,ABSENT.,The dews of blessing heaviest fall
3383,ABSENT.,Where care falls too.
3384,ABSENT.,
3385,ABSENT.,"""'And I that sent my boys away,"
3386,ABSENT.,"In youthful strength to earn their bread,"
3387,ABSENT.,And died before the hair was gray
3388,ABSENT.,Upon my head--
3389,ABSENT.,
3390,ABSENT.,"""'I say to thee, though free from care,"
3391,ABSENT.,"A lonely lot, an aimless life,"
3392,ABSENT.,The crowning comfort is not there--
3393,ABSENT.,"Son, take a wife.'"
3394,ABSENT.,
3395,ABSENT.,"""'Father beloved,' the son replied,"
3396,ABSENT.,"And failed to gather to his breast,"
3397,ABSENT.,"With arms in darkness searching wide,"
3398,ABSENT.,The formless guest.
3399,ABSENT.,
3400,ABSENT.,"""'I am but free, as sorrow is,"
3401,ABSENT.,"To dry her tears, to laugh, to talk;"
3402,ABSENT.,"And free, as sick men are, I wis"
3403,ABSENT.,To rise and walk.
3404,ABSENT.,
3405,ABSENT.,"""'And free, as poor men are, to buy"
3406,ABSENT.,If they have nought wherewith to pay;

3408,ABSENT.,To wipe away.
3409,ABSENT.,
3410,ABSENT.,"""'What 'vails it there are wives to win,"
3411,ABSENT.,"And faithful hearts for those to yearn,"
3412,ABSENT.,Who find not aught thereto akin
3413,ABSENT.,To make return?
3414,ABSENT.,
3415,ABSENT.,"""'Shall he take much who little gives,"
3416,ABSENT.,"And dwells in spirit far away,"
3417,ABSENT.,When she that in his presence lives
3418,ABSENT.,"Doth never stray,"
3419,ABSENT.,
3420,ABSENT.,"""But waking, guideth as beseems"
3421,ABSENT.,"The happy house in order trim,"
3422,ABSENT.,"And tends her babes; and sleeping, dreams"
3423,ABSENT.,Of them and him?
3424,ABSENT.,
3425,ABSENT.,"""'O base, O cold,'""--while thus he spake"
3426,ABSENT.,"The dream broke off, the vision fled;"
3427,ABSENT.,He carried on his speech awake
3428,ABSENT.,And sighing said--
3429,ABSENT.,
3430,ABSENT.,"""'I had--ah happy man!--I had"
3431,ABSENT.,"A precious jewel in my breast,"
3432,ABSENT.,And while I kept it I was glad
3433,ABSENT.,"At work, at rest!"
3434,ABSENT.,
3435,ABSENT.,"""'Call it a heart, and call it strong"
3436,ABSENT.,As upward stroke of eagle's wing;

3438,ABSENT.,The beating thing.
3439,ABSENT.,
3440,ABSENT.,"""'In tangles of the jungle reed,"

3443,ABSENT.,"'Neath rainy skies,"
3444,ABSENT.,
3445,ABSENT.,"""'Still youthful manhood, fresh and keen,"
3446,ABSENT.,At danger gazed with awed delight

3449,ABSENT.,
3450,ABSENT.,"""'I had--ah happy! but 'tis gone,"
3451,ABSENT.,"The priceless jewel; one came by,"
3452,ABSENT.,And saw and stood awhile to con
3453,ABSENT.,"With curious eye,"
3454,ABSENT.,
3455,ABSENT.,"""'And wished for it, and faintly smiled"
3456,ABSENT.,"From under lashes black as doom,"
3457,ABSENT.,"With subtle sweetness, tender, mild,"
3458,ABSENT.,That did illume
3459,ABSENT.,
3460,ABSENT.,"""'The perfect face, and shed on it"
3461,ABSENT.,"A charm, half feeling, half surprise,"
3462,ABSENT.,And brim with dreams the exquisite
3463,ABSENT.,Brown blessèd eyes.
3464,ABSENT.,
3465,ABSENT.,"""'Was it for this, no more but this,"
3466,ABSENT.,"I took and laid it in her hand,"
3467,ABSENT.,"By dimples ruled, to hint submiss,"
3468,ABSENT.,By frown unmanned?
3469,ABSENT.,
3470,ABSENT.,"""'It was for this--and O farewell"

3474,ABSENT.,
3475,ABSENT.,"""'I gave the jewel from my breast,"
3476,ABSENT.,She played with it a little while

3478,ABSENT.,Fed by her smile;
3479,ABSENT.,
3480,ABSENT.,"""'Then weary of it--far from land,"
3481,ABSENT.,"With sigh as deep as destiny,"
3482,ABSENT.,She let it drop from her fair hand
3483,ABSENT.,"Into the sea,"
3484,ABSENT.,
3485,ABSENT.,"""'And watched it sink; and I--and I,--"
3486,ABSENT.,"What shall I do, for all is vain?"
3487,ABSENT.,"No wave will bring, no gold will buy,"
3488,ABSENT.,No toil attain;

3490,ABSENT.,"""'Nor any diver reach to raise"
3491,ABSENT.,My jewel from the blue abyss;

3508,ABSENT.,Man's dearer gain.
3509,ABSENT.,
3510,ABSENT.,"""'I worked afar that I might rear"
3511,ABSENT.,A peaceful home on English soil;

3513,ABSENT.,I loved my toil.
3514,ABSENT.,
3515,ABSENT.,"""'Forever in my spirit spake"

3907,PRESENT.,
3908,PRESENT.,"Now dreamy deep, now sweetly keen,"

3966,PRESENT.,As she withdrew.
3967,PRESENT.,
3968,PRESENT.,"Then nearer did the sunshine creep,"
3969,PRESENT.,And warmer came the wafting breeze;
3970,PRESENT.,The little babe was fast asleep

3972,PRESENT.,
3973,PRESENT.,"Fair was the face that o'er it leant,"

3975,PRESENT.,"The downcast lashes, shyly bent,"
3976,PRESENT.,That failed to hide
3977,PRESENT.,
3978,PRESENT.,Some tender shame. She did not see;
3979,PRESENT.,"She felt his eyes that would not stir,"
3980,PRESENT.,"She looked upon her babe, and he"
3981,PRESENT.,So looked at her.
3982,PRESENT.,
3983,PRESENT.,"So grave, so wondering, so content,"
3984,PRESENT.,"As one new waked to conscious life,"
3985,PRESENT.,"Whose sudden joy with fear is blent,"
3986,PRESENT.,"He said, ""My wife."""

5667,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""A boat, his boat;"" and off he went, well pleased."
5668,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
5669,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","We, too, rose up (the crimson in the sky"
5670,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Flushing our faces), and went sauntering on,"
5671,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And thought to reach our lodging, by the cliff."
5672,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And up and down among the heather beds,"
5673,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And up and down between the sheaves we sped,"
5674,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Doubling and winding; for a long ravine
5675,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Ran up into the land and cut us off,"
5676,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Pushing out slippery ledges for the birds.
5677,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And rent with many a crevice, where the wind"
5678,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Had laid up drifts of empty eggshells, swept"
5679,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",From the bare berths of gulls and guillemots.
5680,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
5681,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",So as it chanced we lighted on a path
5682,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",That led into a nutwood; and our talk
5683,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Was louder than beseemed, if we had known,"
5684,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","With argument and laughter; for the path,"
5685,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","As we sped onward, took a sudden turn"
5686,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Abrupt, and we came out on churchyard grass,"
5687,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And close upon a porch, and face to face"
5688,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","With those within, and with the thirty graves."
5689,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","We heard the voice of one who preached within,"
5690,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And stopped. ""Come on,"" my brother whispered me;"
5691,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""It were more decent that we enter now;"
5692,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Come on! we'll hear this rare old demigod:
5693,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","I like strong men and large; I like gray heads,"
5694,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And grand gruff voices, hoarse though this may be"
5695,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","With shouting in the storm."""
5696,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","It was not hoarse,"
5697,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",The voice that preached to those few fishermen
5698,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And women, nursing mothers with the babes"
5699,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Hushed on their breasts; and yet it held them not:
5700,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Their drowsy eyes were drawn to look at us,"
5701,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Till, having leaned our rods against the wall,"
5702,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And left the dogs at watch, we entered, sat,"
5703,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And were apprised that, though he saw us not,"
5704,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",The parson knew that he had lost the eyes
5705,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And ears of those before him, for he made"
5706,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","A pause--a long dead pause, and dropped his arms,"
5707,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And stood awaiting, till I felt the red"
5708,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Mount to my brow.
5709,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And a soft fluttering stir
5710,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Passed over all, and every mother hushed"
5711,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","The babe beneath her shawl, and he turned round"
5712,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And met our eyes, unused to diffidence,"
5713,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",But diffident of his; then with a sigh
5714,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Fronted the folk, lifted his grand gray head,"
5715,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And said, as one that pondered now the words"
5716,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","He had been preaching on with new surprise,"
5717,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And found fresh marvel in their sound, ""Behold!"
5718,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Behold!"" saith He, ""I stand at the door and knock."""
5719,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
5720,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Then said the parson: ""What! and shall He wait,"
5721,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And must He wait, not only till we say,"
5722,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","'Good Lord, the house is clean, the hearth is swept."
5723,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","The children sleep, the mackerel-boats are in,"
5724,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And all the nets are mended; therefore I
5725,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Will slowly to the door and open it:'
5726,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","But must He also wait where still, behold!"
5727,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","He stands and knocks, while we do say, 'Good Lord."
5728,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","The gentlefolk are come to worship here,"
5729,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And I will up and open to Thee soon;
5730,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","But first I pray a little longer wait,"
5731,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",For I am taken up with them; my eyes
5732,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Must needs regard the fashion of their clothes,"
5733,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And count the gains I think to make by them;
5734,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Forsooth, they are of much account, good Lord!"
5735,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Therefore have patience with me--wait, dear Lord"
5736,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Or come again?'
5737,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",What! must He wait for THIS--
5738,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","For this? Ay, He doth wait for this, and still,"
5739,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Waiting for this, He, patient, raileth not;"

5970,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And all their trouble.
5971,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","As for me, good Lord,"
5972,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","I have no boat; I am too old, too old--"
5973,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",My lads are drowned; I buried my poor wife;
5974,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",My little lasses died so long ago
5975,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",That mostly I forget what they were like.
5976,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Thou knowest, Lord; they were such little ones."
5977,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","I know they went to Thee, but I forget"
5978,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Their faces, though I missed them sore."
5979,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","O Lord,"
5980,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I was a strong man; I have drawn good food
5981,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And made good money out of Thy great sea:
5982,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","But yet I cried for them at nights; and now,"
5983,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Although I be so old, I miss my lads,"
5984,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And there be many folk this stormy night
5985,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Heavy with fear for theirs. Merciful Lord,"
5986,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Comfort them; save their honest boys, their pride,"
5987,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And let them hear next ebb the blessedest,"
5988,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Best sound--the boat-keels grating on the sand.
5989,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I cannot pray with finer words: I know
5990,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Nothing; I have no learning, cannot learn--"
5991,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Too old, too old. They say I want for nought,"
5992,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I have the parish pay; but I am dull
5993,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Of hearing, and the fire scarce warms me through."
5994,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","God save me, I have been a sinful man--"
5995,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And save the lives of them that still can work,"
5996,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","For they are good to me; ay, good to me."
5997,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","But, Lord, I am a trouble! and I sit,"
5998,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And I am lonesome, and the nights are few"
5999,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","That any think to come and draw a chair,"
6000,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And sit in my poor place and talk a while.
6001,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Why should they come, forsooth? Only the wind"
6002,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Knocks at my door, O long and loud it knocks,"
6003,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",The only thing God made that has a mind
6004,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",To enter in.'
6005,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6006,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""Yea, thus the old man spake:"
6007,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",These were the last words of his aged mouth--
6008,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","BUT ONE DID KNOCK. One came to sup with him,"
6009,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","That humble, weak, old man; knocked at his door"
6010,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",In the rough pauses of the laboring wind.
6011,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I tell you that One knocked while it was dark.
6012,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Save where their foaming passion had made white
6013,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Those livid seething billows. What He said
6014,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","In that poor place where He did talk a while,"
6015,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","I cannot tell: but this I am assured,"
6016,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","That when the neighbors came the morrow morn,"
6017,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","What time the wind had bated, and the sun"
6018,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Shone on the old man's floor, they saw the smile"
6019,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","He passed away in, and they said, 'He looks"
6020,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","As he had woke and seen the face of Christ,"
6021,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And with that rapturous smile held out his arms
6022,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",To come to Him!'
6023,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6024,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""Can such an one be here,"
6025,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","So old, so weak, so ignorant, so frail?"
6026,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","The Lord be good to thee, thou poor old man;"
6027,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",It would be hard with thee if heaven were shut
6028,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","To such as have not learning! Nay, nay, nay,"
6029,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",He condescends to them of low estate;
6030,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","To such as are despised He cometh down,"
6031,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Stands at the door and knocks.
6032,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6033,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""Yet bear with me."
6034,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I have a message; I have more to say.
6035,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Shall sorrow win His pity, and not sin--"
6036,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",That burden ten times heavier to be borne?
6037,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",What think you? Shall the virtuous have His care
6038,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Alone? O virtuous women, think not scorn."
6039,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",For you may lift your faces everywhere;
6040,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And now that it grows dusk, and I can see"
6041,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","None though they front me straight, I fain would tell"
6042,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",A certain thing to you. I say to _you_;
6043,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And if it doth concern you, as methinks"
6044,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","It doth, then surely it concerneth all."
6045,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I say that there was once--I say not here--
6046,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","I say that there was once a castaway,"
6047,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And she was weeping, weeping bitterly;"
6048,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Kneeling, and crying with a heart-sick cry"
6049,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",That choked itself in sobs--'O my good name!
6050,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Oh my good name!' And none did hear her cry!
6051,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Nay; and it lightened, and the storm-bolts fell,"
6052,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And the rain splashed upon the roof, and still"
6053,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","She, storm-tost as the storming elements--"
6054,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","She cried with an exceeding bitter cry,"
6055,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",'O my good name!' And then the thunder-cloud
6056,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Stooped low and burst in darkness overhead,"
6057,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And rolled, and rocked her on her knees, and shook"
6058,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",The frail foundations of her dwelling-place.
6059,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",But she--if any neighbors had come in
6060,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","(None did): if any neighbors had come in,"
6061,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",They might have seen her crying on her knees.
6062,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And sobbing 'Lost, lost, lost!' beating her breast--"
6063,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Her breast forever pricked with cruel thorns.
6064,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",The wounds whereof could neither balm assuage
6065,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Nor any patience heal--beating her brow,"
6066,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Which ached, it had been bent so long to hide"
6067,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","From level eyes, whose meaning was contempt."
6068,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6069,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""O ye good women, it is hard to leave"
6070,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","The paths of virtue, and return again."
6071,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","What if this sinner wept, and none of you"
6072,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Comforted her? And what if she did strive
6073,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","To mend, and none of you believed her strife."
6074,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Nor looked upon her? Mark, I do not say,"
6075,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Though it was hard, you therefore were to blame;"
6076,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","That she had aught against you, though your feet"
6077,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Never drew near her door. But I beseech
6078,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Your patience. Once in old Jerusalem
6079,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","A woman kneeled at consecrated feet,"
6080,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Kissed them, and washed them with her tears."
6081,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",What then?
6082,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I think that yet our Lord is pitiful:
6083,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I think I see the castaway e'en now!
6084,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And she is not alone: the heavy rain
6085,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Splashes without, and sullen thunder rolls,"
6086,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",But she is lying at the sacred feet
6087,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Of One transfigured.
6088,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6089,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""And her tears flow down,"
6090,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Down to her lips,--her lips that kiss the print"
6091,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Of nails; and love is like to break her heart!
6092,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Love and repentance--for it still doth work
6093,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Sore in her soul to think, to think that she,"
6094,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Even she, did pierce the sacred, sacred feet."
6095,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And bruise the thorn-crowned head.
6096,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6097,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""O Lord, our Lord,"
6098,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","How great is Thy compassion. Come, good Lord,"
6099,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","For we will open. Come this night, good Lord;"
6100,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Stand at the door and knock.
6101,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6102,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","""And is this all?--"
6103,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Trouble, old age and simpleness, and sin--"
6104,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",This all? It might be all some other night;
6105,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","But this night, if a voice said 'Give account"
6106,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Whom hast thou with thee?' then must I reply,"
6107,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","'Young manhood have I, beautiful youth and strength,"
6108,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Rich with all treasure drawn up from the crypt
6109,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Where lies the learning of the ancient world--
6110,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Brave with all thoughts that poets fling upon
6111,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","The strand of life, as driftweed after storms:"

6113,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And the dread purity of Alpine snows,"
6114,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Doubtless familiar with Thy works concealed
6115,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","For ages from mankind--outlying worlds,"
6116,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And many moonèd spheres--and Thy great store
6117,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Of stars, more thick than mealy dust which here"
6118,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Powders the pale leaves of Auriculas.
6119,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","This do I know, but, Lord, I know not more."
6120,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Not more concerning them--concerning Thee,"
6121,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",I know Thy bounty; where Thou givest much
6122,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Standing without, if any call Thee in"
6123,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Thou givest more.' Speak, then, O rich and strong:"

6128,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",
6129,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","I have heard many speak, but this one man--"
6130,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",So anxious not to go to heaven alone--
6131,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","This one man I remember, and his look,"
6132,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",Till twilight overshadowed him. He ceased.
6133,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.",And out in darkness with the fisherfolk
6134,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","We passed and stumbled over mounds of moss,"
6135,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","And heard, but did not see, the passing beck."
6136,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","Ah, graceless heart, would that it could regain"

6138,"BROTHERS, AND A SERMON.","The impress full of tender awe, that night,"

6182,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6183,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6184,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I love this gray old church, the low, long nave,"
6185,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The ivied chancel and the slender spire;
6186,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"No less its shadow on each heaving grave,"
6187,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With growing osier bound, or living brier;"
6188,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I love those yew-tree trunks, where stand arrayed"
6189,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,So many deep-cut names of youth and maid.
6190,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6191,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,A simple custom this--I love it well--
6192,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,A carved betrothal and a pledge of truth;
6193,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"How many an eve, their linkèd names to spell,"
6194,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Beneath the yew-trees sat our village youth!
6195,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"When work was over, and the new-cut hay"
6196,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Sent wafts of balm from meadows where it lay.
6197,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6198,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah! many an eve, while I was yet a boy,"
6199,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Some village hind has beckoned me aside,"
6200,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And sought mine aid, with shy and awkward joy,"
6201,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To carve the letters of his rustic bride,"
6202,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And make them clear to read as graven stone,"
6203,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Deep in the yew-tree's trunk beside his own.
6204,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6205,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"For none could carve like me, and here they stand."
6206,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Fathers and mothers of this present race:
6207,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And underscored by some less practised hand,"
6208,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That fain the story of its line would trace,"
6209,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With children's names, and number, and the day"
6210,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,When any called to God have passed away.
6211,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6212,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I look upon them, and I turn aside,"
6213,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,As oft when carving them I did erewhile;
6214,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And there I see those wooden bridges wide
6215,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,That cross the marshy hollow; there the stile
6216,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"In reeds embedded, and the swelling down,"
6217,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And the white road towards the distant town.
6218,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6219,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But those old bridges claim another look.
6220,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Our brattling river tumbles through the one;
6221,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The second spans a shallow, weedy brook;"
6222,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Beneath the others, and beneath the sun,"
6223,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Lie two long stilly pools, and on their breasts"
6224,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Picture their wooden piles, encased in swallows' nests."
6225,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6226,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And round about them grows a fringe of reeds,"
6227,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And then a floating crown of lily-flowers,"
6228,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And yet within small silver-budded weeds;
6229,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But each clear centre evermore embowers
6230,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"A deeper sky, where, stooping, you may see"
6231,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The little minnows darting restlessly.
6232,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6233,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"My heart is bitter, lilies, at your sweet;"
6234,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Why did the dewdrop fringe your chalices?
6235,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Why in your beauty are you thus complete,"
6236,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,You silver ships--you floating palaces?
6237,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"O! if need be, you must allure man's eye,"
6238,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Yet wherefore blossom here? O why? O why?
6239,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6240,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"O! O! the world is wide, you lily flowers,"
6241,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It hath warm forests, cleft by stilly pools,"
6242,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Where every night bathe crowds of stars; and bowers
6243,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Of spicery hang over. Sweet air cools
6244,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And shakes the lilies among those stars that lie:
6245,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Why are not ye content to reign there? Why?
6246,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6247,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That chain of bridges, it were hard to tell"
6248,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,How it is linked with all my early joy.
6249,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"There was a little foot that I loved well,"
6250,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,It danced across them when I was a boy;
6251,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,There was a careless voice that used to sing;
6252,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"There was a child, a sweet and happy thing."
6253,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6254,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Oft through that matted wood of oak and birch
6255,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,She came from yonder house upon the hill;
6256,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She crossed the wooden bridges to the church,"
6257,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And watched, with village girls, my boasted skill:"
6258,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But loved to watch the floating lilies best,"
6259,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Or linger, peering in a swallow's nest;"
6260,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6261,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Linger and linger, with her wistful eyes"
6262,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Drawn to the lily-buds that lay so white
6263,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And soft on crimson water; for the skies
6264,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Would crimson, and the little cloudlets bright"
6265,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Would all be flung among the flowers sheer down,"
6266,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,To flush the spaces of their clustering crown.
6267,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6268,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Till the green rushes--O, so glossy green--"
6269,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The rushes, they would whisper, rustle, shake;"
6270,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And forth on floating gauze, no jewelled queen"
6271,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"So rich, the green-eyed dragon-flies would break,"
6272,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And hover on the flowers--aërial things,"
6273,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With little rainbows flickering on their wings.
6274,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6275,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah! my heart dear! the polished pools lie still,"
6276,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Like lanes of water reddened by the west,"
6277,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Till, swooping down from yon o'erhanging hill,"
6278,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The bold marsh harrier wets her tawny breast;
6279,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"We scared her oft in childhood from her prey,"
6280,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And the old eager thoughts rise fresh as yesterday.
6281,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6282,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To yonder copse by moonlight I did go,"
6283,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"In luxury of mischief, half afraid,"
6284,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To steal the great owl's brood, her downy snow,"
6285,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her screaming imps to seize, the while she preyed"
6286,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With yellow, cruel eyes, whose radiant glare,"
6287,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Fell with their mother rage, I might not dare."
6288,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6289,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Panting I lay till her great fanning wings
6290,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Troubled the dreams of rock-doves, slumbering nigh,"
6291,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And she and her fierce mate, like evil things,"
6292,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Skimmed the dusk fields; then rising, with a cry"
6293,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of fear, joy, triumph, darted on my prey."
6294,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And tore it from the nest and fled away.
6295,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6296,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But afterward, belated in the wood,"
6297,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I saw her moping on the rifled tree,"
6298,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And my heart smote me for her, while I stood"
6299,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Awakened from my careless reverie;
6300,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"So white she looked, with moonlight round her shed."
6301,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,So motherlike she drooped and hung her head.
6302,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6303,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O that mine eyes would cheat me! I behold
6304,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The godwits running by the water edge,"
6305,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Tim mossy bridges mirrored as of old;
6306,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The little curlews creeping from the sedge,"
6307,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But not the little foot so gayly light
6308,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"O that mine eyes would cheat me, that I might!--"
6309,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6310,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Would cheat me! I behold the gable ends--
6311,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Those purple pigeons clustering on the cote;
6312,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The lane with maples overhung, that bends"
6313,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Toward her dwelling; the dry grassy moat,"
6314,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Thick mullions, diamond-latticed, mossed and gray,"
6315,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And walls bunked up with laurel and with bay.
6316,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6317,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And up behind them yellow fields of corn,"
6318,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And still ascending countless firry spires,"
6319,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Dry slopes of hills uncultured, bare, forlorn,"
6320,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And green in rocky clefts with whins and briers;
6321,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Then rich cloud masses dyed the violet's hue,"
6322,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With orange sunbeams dropping swiftly through.
6323,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6324,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ay, I behold all this full easily;"
6325,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My soul is jealous of my happier eyes.
6326,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And manhood envies youth. Ah, strange to see,"
6327,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"By looking merely, orange-flooded skies;"
6328,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Nay, any dew-drop that may near me shine:"
6329,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But never more the face of Eglantine!
6330,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6331,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She was my one companion, being herself"
6332,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The jewel and adornment of my days,"
6333,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"My life's completeness. O, a smiling elf,"
6334,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,That I do but disparage with my praise--
6335,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"My playmate; and I loved her dearly and long,"
6336,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And she loved me, as the tender love the strong."
6337,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6338,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ay, but she grew, till on a time there came"
6339,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,A sudden restless yearning to my heart;
6340,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And as we went a-nesting, all for shame"
6341,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And shyness, I did hold my peace, and start;"
6342,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Content departed, comfort shut me out,"
6343,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And there was nothing left to talk about.
6344,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6345,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She had but sixteen years, and as for me,"
6346,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Four added made my life. This pretty bird,"
6347,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"This fairy bird that I had cherished--she,"
6348,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Content, had sung, while I, contented, heard."
6349,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The song had ceased; the bird, with nature's art,"
6350,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Had brought a thorn and set it in my heart.
6351,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6352,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The restless birth of love my soul opprest,"
6353,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I longed and wrestled for a tranquil day,"
6354,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And warred with that disquiet in my breast
6355,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,As one who knows there is a better way;
6356,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But, turned against myself, I still in vain"
6357,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Looked for the ancient calm to come again.
6358,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6359,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My tired soul could to itself confess
6360,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,That she deserved a wiser love than mine;
6361,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To love more truly were to love her less,"
6362,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And for this truth I still awoke to pine;
6363,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I had a dim belief that it would be
6364,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"A better thing for her, a blessed thing for me."
6365,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6366,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Good hast Thou made them--comforters right sweet;
6367,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Good hast Thou made the world, to mankind lent;"
6368,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Good are Thy dropping clouds that feed the wheat;
6369,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Good are Thy stars above the firmament.
6370,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Take to Thee, take, Thy worship, Thy renown;"
6371,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The good which Thou hast made doth wear Thy crown.
6372,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6373,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"For, O my God, Thy creatures are so frail,"
6374,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Thy bountiful creation is so fair.
6375,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That, drawn before us like the temple veil,"
6376,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It hides the Holy Place from thought and care,"
6377,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Giving man's eyes instead its sweeping fold,"
6378,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Rich as with cherub wings and apples wrought of gold.
6379,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6380,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Purple and blue and scarlet--shimmering bells
6381,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And rare pomegranates on its broidered rim,"
6382,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Glorious with chain and fretwork that the swell
6383,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of incense shakes to music dreamy and dim,"
6384,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Till on a day comes loss, that God makes gain,"
6385,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And death and darkness rend the veil in twain.
6386,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6387,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,*       *       *       *       *
6388,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6389,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah, sweetest! my beloved! each outward thing"
6390,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Recalls my youth, and is instinct with thee;"
6391,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Brown wood-owls in the dusk, with noiseless wing,"
6392,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Float from yon hanger to their haunted tree,"
6393,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And hoot full softly. Listening, I regain"
6394,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,A flashing thought of thee with their remembered strain.
6395,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6396,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I will not pine--it is the careless brook.
6397,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,These amber sunbeams slanting down the vale;
6398,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It is the long tree-shadows, with their look"
6399,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of natural peace, that make my heart to fail:"
6400,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The peace of nature--No, I will not pine--"
6401,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But O the contrast 'twixt her face and mine!
6402,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6403,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And still I changed--I was a boy no more;
6404,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"My heart was large enough to hold my kind,"
6405,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And all the world. As hath been oft before
6406,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With youth, I sought, but I could never find"
6407,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Work hard enough to quiet my self-strife,"
6408,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And use the strength of action-craving life.
6409,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6410,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She, too, was changed: her bountiful sweet eyes"
6411,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Looked out full lovingly on all the world.
6412,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O tender as the deeps in yonder skies
6413,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Their beaming! but her rosebud lips were curled
6414,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With the soft dimple of a musing smile,"
6415,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Which kept my gaze, but held me mute the while."
6416,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6417,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"A cast of bees, a slowly moving wain,"
6418,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The scent of bean-flowers wafted up a dell,"
6419,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Blue pigeons wheeling over fields of grain,"
6420,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Or bleat of folded lamb, would please her well;"
6421,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Or cooing of the early coted dove;--
6422,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She sauntering mused of these; I, following, mused of love."
6423,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6424,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With her two lips, that one the other pressed"
6425,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"So poutingly with such a tranquil air,"
6426,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With her two eyes, that on my own would rest"
6427,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"So dream-like, she denied my silent prayer,"
6428,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Fronted unuttered words and said them nay,"
6429,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And smiled down love till it had nought to say.
6430,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6431,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The words that through mine eyes would clearly shine
6432,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Hovered and hovered on my lips in vain;
6433,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"If after pause I said but ""Eglantine,"""
6434,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She raised to me her quiet eyelids twain,"
6435,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And looked me this reply--look calm, yet bland--"
6436,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""I shall not know, I will not understand."""
6437,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6438,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Yet she did know my story--knew my life
6439,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Was wrought to hers with bindings many and strong
6440,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That I, like Israel, served for a wife,"
6441,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And for the love I bare her thought not long,"
6442,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But only a few days, full quickly told,"
6443,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My seven years' service strict as his of old.
6444,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6445,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I must be brief: the twilight shadows grow,"
6446,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And steal the rose-bloom genial summer sheds,"
6447,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And scented wafts of wind that come and go
6448,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Have lifted dew from honeyed clover-heads;
6449,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The seven stars shine out above the mill,"
6450,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The dark delightsome woods lie veiled and still.
6451,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6452,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Hush! hush! the nightingale begins to sing,"
6453,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And stops, as ill-contented with her note;"
6454,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Then breaks from out the bush with hurried wing.
6455,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Restless and passionate. She tunes her throat,"
6456,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Laments awhile in wavering trills, and then"
6457,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Floods with a stream of sweetness all the glen.
6458,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6459,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The seven stars upon the nearest pool
6460,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Lie trembling down betwixt the lily leaves,"
6461,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And move like glowworms; wafting breezes cool
6462,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Come down along the water, and it heaves"
6463,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And bubbles in the sedge; while deep and wide
6464,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The dim night settles on the country side.
6465,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6466,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I know this scene by heart. O! once before
6467,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I saw the seven stars float to and fro,"
6468,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And stayed my hurried footsteps by the shore
6469,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,To mark the starry picture spread below:
6470,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Its silence made the tumult in my breast
6471,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,More audible; its peace revealed my own unrest.
6472,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6473,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I paused, then hurried on; my heart beat quick;"
6474,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I crossed the bridges, reached the steep ascent,"
6475,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And climbed through matted fern and hazels thick;
6476,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Then darkling through the close green maples went
6477,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And saw--there felt love's keenest pangs begin--
6478,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,An oriel window lighted from within--
6479,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6480,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I saw--and felt that they were scarcely cares
6481,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Which I had known before; I drew more near,"
6482,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And O! methought how sore it frets and wears
6483,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The soul to part with that it holds so dear;
6484,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Tis hard two woven tendrils to untwine,"
6485,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And I was come to part with Eglantine.
6486,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6487,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"For life was bitter through those words repressed,"
6488,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And youth was burdened with unspoken vows;
6489,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Love unrequited brooded in my breast,"
6490,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And shrank, at glance, from the beloved brows:"
6491,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And three long months, heart-sick, my foot withdrawn,"
6492,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I had not sought her side by rivulet, copse, or lawn--"
6493,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6494,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Not sought her side, yet busy thought no less"
6495,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Still followed in her wake, though far behind;"
6496,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And I, being parted from her loveliness,"
6497,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Looked at the picture of her in my mind:
6498,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I lived alone, I walked with soul oppressed,"
6499,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And ever sighed for her, and sighed for rest."
6500,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6501,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Then I had risen to struggle with my heart.
6502,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And said--""O heart! the world is fresh and fair,"
6503,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And I am young; but this thy restless smart
6504,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Changes to bitterness the morning air:
6505,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I will, I must, these weary fetters break--"
6506,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I will be free, if only for her sake."
6507,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6508,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""O let me trouble her no more with sighs!"
6509,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Heart-healing comes by distance, and with time:"
6510,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Then let me wander, and enrich mine eyes"
6511,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With the green forests of a softer clime,"
6512,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Or list by night at sea the wind's low stave
6513,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And long monotonous rockings of the wave.
6514,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6515,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""Through open solitudes, unbounded meads,"
6516,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Where, wading on breast-high in yellow bloom,"
6517,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Untamed of man, the shy white lama feeds--"
6518,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,There would I journey and forget my doom;
6519,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Or far, O far as sunrise I would see"
6520,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The level prairie stretch away from me!
6521,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6522,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""Or I would sail upon the tropic seas,"
6523,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Where fathom long the blood-red dulses grow,"
6524,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Droop from the rock and waver in the breeze,"
6525,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Lashing the tide to foam; while calm below
6526,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The muddy mandrakes throng those waters warm,"
6527,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And purple, gold, and green, the living blossoms swarm."""
6528,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6529,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"So of my father I did win consent,"
6530,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With importunities repeated long,"
6531,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To make that duty which had been my bent,"
6532,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To dig with strangers alien tombs among,"
6533,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And bound to them through desert leagues to pace.
6534,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Or track up rivers to their starting-place.
6535,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6536,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"For this I had done battle and had won,"
6537,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But not alone to tread Arabian sands,"
6538,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Measure the shadows of a southern sun,"
6539,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Or dig out gods in the old Egyptian lands;
6540,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But for the dream wherewith I thought to cope--
6541,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The grief of love unmated with love's hope.
6542,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6543,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And now I would set reason in array,"
6544,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Methought, and fight for freedom manfully,"
6545,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Till by long absence there would come a day
6546,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,When this my love would not be pain to me;
6547,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But if I knew my rosebud fair and blest
6548,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I should not pine to wear it on my breast.
6549,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6550,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The days fled on; another week should fling
6551,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,A foreign shadow on my lengthening way;
6552,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Another week, yet nearness did not bring"
6553,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,A braver heart that hard farewell to say.
6554,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I let the last day wane, the dusk begin,"
6555,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Ere I had sought that window lighted from within.
6556,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6557,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Sinking and sinking, O my heart! my heart!"
6558,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Will absence heal thee whom its shade doth rend?
6559,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I reached the little gate, and soft within"
6560,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The oriel fell her shadow. She did lend
6561,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her loveliness to me, and let me share"
6562,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The listless sweetness of those features fair.
6563,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6564,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Among thick laurels in the gathering gloom,"
6565,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Heavy for this our parting, I did stand;"
6566,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Beside her mother in the lighted room,"
6567,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,She sitting leaned her cheek upon her hand
6568,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And as she read, her sweet voice floating through"
6569,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The open casement seemed to mourn me an adieu.
6570,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6571,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Youth! youth! how buoyant are thy hopes! they turn,"
6572,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Like marigolds, toward the sunny side."
6573,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"My hopes were buried in a funeral urn,"
6574,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And they sprung up like plants and spread them wide;
6575,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Though I had schooled and reasoned them away,"
6576,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,They gathered smiling near and prayed a holiday.
6577,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6578,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah, sweetest voice! how pensive were its tones,"
6579,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And how regretful its unconscious pause!
6580,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""Is it for me her heart this sadness owns,"
6581,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And is our parting of to-night the cause?
6582,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah, would it might be so!"" I thought, and stood"
6583,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Listening entranced among the underwood.
6584,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6585,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I thought it would be something worth the pain
6586,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of parting, to look once in those deep eyes,"
6587,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And take from them an answering look again:
6588,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""When eastern palms,"" I thought, ""about me rise,"
6589,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"If I might carve our names upon the rind,"
6590,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Betrothed, I would not mourn, though leaving thee behind."""
6591,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6592,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I can be patient, faithful, and most fond"
6593,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,To unacknowledged love; I can be true
6594,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To this sweet thraldom, this unequal bond,"
6595,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,This yoke of mine that reaches not to you:
6596,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"O, how much more could costly parting buy--"
6597,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"If not a pledge, one kiss, or, failing that, a sigh!"
6598,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6599,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I listened, and she ceased to read; she turned"
6600,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Her face towards the laurels where I stood:
6601,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Her mother spoke--O wonder! hardly learned;
6602,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She said, ""There is a rustling in the wood;"
6603,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah, child! if one draw near to bid farewell,"
6604,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Let not thine eyes an unsought secret tell.
6605,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6606,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""My daughter, there is nothing held so dear"
6607,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"As love, if only it be hard to win."
6608,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The roses that in yonder hedge appear
6609,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Outdo our garden-buds which bloom within;
6610,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But since the hand may pluck them every day,"
6611,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Unmarked they bud, bloom, drop, and drift away."
6612,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6613,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""My daughter, my beloved, be not you"
6614,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Like those same roses."" O bewildering word!"
6615,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"My heart stood still, a mist obscured my view:"
6616,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,It cleared; still silence. No denial stirred
6617,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The lips beloved; but straight, as one opprest,"
6618,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She, kneeling, dropped her face upon her mother's breast."
6619,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6620,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"This said, ""My daughter, sorrow comes to all;"
6621,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Our life is checked with shadows manifold:
6622,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But woman has this more--she may not call
6623,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her sorrow by its name. Yet love not told,"
6624,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And only born of absence and by thought,"
6625,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With thought and absence may return to nought."""
6626,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6627,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And my belovèd lifted up her face,"
6628,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And moved her lips as if about to speak;
6629,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She dropped her lashes with a girlish grace,"
6630,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And the rich damask mantled in her cheek:
6631,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I stood awaiting till she should deny
6632,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her love, or with sweet laughter put it by."
6633,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6634,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But, closer nestling to her mother's heart,"
6635,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She, blushing, said no word to break my trance,"
6636,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"For I was breathless; and, with lips apart,"
6637,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Felt my breast pant and all my pulses dance,"
6638,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And strove to move, but could not for the weight"
6639,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of unbelieving joy, so sudden and so great,"
6640,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6641,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Because she loved me. With a mighty sigh
6642,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Breaking away, I left her on her knees,"
6643,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And blest the laurel bower, the darkened sky,"
6644,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The sultry night of August. Through the trees,"
6645,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Giddy with gladness, to the porch I went,"
6646,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And hardly found the way for joyful wonderment.
6647,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6648,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Yet, when I entered, saw her mother sit"
6649,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With both hands cherishing the graceful head,"
6650,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Smoothing the clustered hair, and parting it"
6651,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"From the fair brow; she, rising, only said,"
6652,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"In the accustomed tone, the accustomed word,"
6653,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The careless greeting that I always heard;
6654,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6655,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And she resumed her merry, mocking smile,"
6656,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Though tear-drops on the glistening lashes hung.
6657,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O woman! thou wert fashioned to beguile:
6658,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"So have all sages said, all poets sung."
6659,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She spoke of favoring winds and waiting ships,"
6660,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With smiles of gratulation on her lips!
6661,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6662,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And then she looked and faltered: I had grown
6663,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,So suddenly in life and soul a man:
6664,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She moved her lips, but could not find a tone"
6665,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,To set her mocking music to; began
6666,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"One struggle for dominion, raised her eyes,"
6667,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And straight withdrew them, bashful through surprise"
6668,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6669,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The color over cheek and bosom flushed;
6670,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I might have heard the beating of her heart,"
6671,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But that mine own beat louder; when she blushed,"
6672,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The hand within mine own I felt to start,"
6673,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But would not change my pitiless decree
6674,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,To strive with her for might and mastery.
6675,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6676,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She looked again, as one that, half afraid,"
6677,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Would fain be certain of a doubtful thing;
6678,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Or one beseeching ""Do not me upbraid!"""
6679,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And then she trembled like the fluttering
6680,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of timid little birds, and silent stood,"
6681,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,No smile wherewith to mock my hardihood.
6682,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6683,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She turned, and to an open casement moved"
6684,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With girlish shyness, mute beneath my gaze."
6685,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And I on downcast lashes unreproved
6686,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Could look as long as pleased me; while, the rays"
6687,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of moonlight round her, she her fair head bent,"
6688,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,In modest silence to my words attent.
6689,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6690,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,How fast the giddy whirling moments flew!
6691,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The moon had set; I heard the midnight chime,"
6692,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Hope is more brave than fear, and joy than dread."
6693,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And I could wait unmoved the parting time.
6694,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It came; for, by a sudden impulse drawn,"
6695,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She, risen, stepped out upon the dusky lawn."
6696,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6697,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"A little waxen taper in her hand,"
6698,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her feet upon the dry and dewless grass,"
6699,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She looked like one of the celestial band,"
6700,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Only that on her cheeks did dawn and pass
6701,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Most human blushes; while, the soft light thrown"
6702,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"On vesture pure and white, she seemed yet fairer grown."
6703,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6704,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her mother, looking out toward her, sighed,"
6705,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Then gave her hand in token of farewell.
6706,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And with her warning eyes, that seemed to chide,"
6707,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Scarce suffered that I sought her child to tell
6708,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The story of my life, whose every line"
6709,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,No other burden bore than--Eglantine.
6710,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6711,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Black thunder-clouds were rising up behind,"
6712,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The waxen taper burned full steadily;
6713,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,It seemed as if dark midnight had a mind
6714,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To hear what lovers say, and her decree"
6715,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Had passed for silence, while she, dropped to ground"
6716,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With raiment floating wide, drank in the sound."
6717,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6718,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O happiness! thou dost not leave a trace
6719,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"So well defined as sorrow. Amber light,"
6720,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Shed like a glory on her angel face,"
6721,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I can remember fully, and the sight"
6722,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of her fair forehead and her shining eyes,"
6723,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And lips that smiled in sweet and girlish wise.
6724,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6725,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I can remember how the taper played
6726,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Over her small hands and her vesture white;
6727,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"How it struck up into the trees, and laid"
6728,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Upon their under leaves unwonted light;
6729,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And when she held it low, how far it spread"
6730,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O'er velvet pansies slumbering on their bed.
6731,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6732,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I can remember that we spoke full low,"
6733,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,That neither doubted of the other's truth;
6734,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And that with footsteps slower and more slow,"
6735,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Hands folded close for love, eyes wet for ruth:"
6736,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Beneath the trees, by that clear taper's flame,"
6737,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,We wandered till the gate of parting came.
6738,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6739,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But I forget the parting words she said,"
6740,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,So much they thrilled the all-attentive soul;
6741,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,For one short moment human heart and head
6742,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,May bear such bliss--its present is the whole:
6743,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I had that present, till in whispers fell"
6744,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With parting gesture her subdued farewell.
6745,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6746,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Farewell! she said, in act to turn away,"
6747,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But stood a moment yet to dry her tears,"
6748,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And suffered my enfolding arm to stay
6749,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The time of her departure. O ye years
6750,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,That intervene betwixt that day and this!
6751,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,You all received your hue from that keen pain and bliss.
6752,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6753,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O mingled pain and bliss! O pain to break
6754,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"At once from happiness so lately found,"
6755,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And four long years to feel for her sweet sake
6756,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The incompleteness of all sight and sound!
6757,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But bliss to cross once more the foaming brine--
6758,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O bliss to come again and make her mine!
6759,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6760,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I cannot--O, I cannot more recall!"
6761,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,But I will soothe my troubled thoughts to rest
6762,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With musing over journeyings wide, and all"
6763,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Observance of this active-humored west,"
6764,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And swarming cities steeped in eastern day,"
6765,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With swarthy tribes in gold and striped array.
6766,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6767,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I turn away from these, and straight there will succeed"
6768,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"(Shifting and changing at the restless will),"
6769,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Imbedded in some deep Circassian mead,"
6770,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"White wagon-tilts, and flocks that eat their fill"
6771,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Unseen above, while comely shepherds pass,"
6772,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And scarcely show their heads above the grass.
6773,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6774,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"--The red Sahara in an angry glow,"
6775,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With amber fogs, across its hollows trailed"
6776,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Long strings of camels, gloomy-eyed and slow,"
6777,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And women on their necks, from gazers veiled,"
6778,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And sun-swart guides who toil across the sand
6779,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,To groves of date-trees on the watered land.
6780,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6781,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Again--the brown sails of an Arab boat,"
6782,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Flapping by night upon a glassy sea,"
6783,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Whereon the moon and planets seem to float,"
6784,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"More bright of hue than they were wont to be,"
6785,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"While shooting-stars rain down with crackling sound,"
6786,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And, thick as swarming locusts, drop to ground."
6787,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6788,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Or far into the heat among the sands
6789,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The gembok nations, snuffing up the wind,"
6790,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Drawn by the scent of water--and the bands
6791,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of tawny-bearded lions pacing, blind"
6792,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With the sun-dazzle in their midst, opprest"
6793,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With prey, and spiritless for lack of rest!"
6794,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6795,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"What more? Old Lebanon, the frosty-browed,"
6796,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Setting his feet among oil-olive trees,"
6797,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Heaving his bare brown shoulder through a cloud;
6798,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And after, grassy Carmel, purple seas,"
6799,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Flattering his dreams and echoing in his rocks,"
6800,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Soft as the bleating of his thousand flocks.
6801,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6802,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Enough: how vain this thinking to beguile,"
6803,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"With recollected scenes, an aching breast!"
6804,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Did not I, journeying, muse on her the while?"
6805,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah, yes! for every landscape comes impressed--"
6806,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ay, written on, as by an iron pen--"
6807,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With the same thought I nursed about her then.
6808,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6809,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Therefore let memory turn again to home;
6810,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Feel, as of old, the joy of drawing near;"
6811,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Watch the green breakers and the wind-tossed foam,"
6812,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And see the land-fog break, dissolve, and clear;"
6813,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Then think a skylark's voice far sweeter sound
6814,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Than ever thrilled but over English ground;
6815,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6816,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And walk, glad, even to tears, among the wheat,"
6817,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Not doubting this to be the first of lands;
6818,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And, while in foreign words this murmuring, meet"
6819,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Some little village school-girls (with their hands
6820,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Full of forget-me-nots), who, greeting me,"
6821,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I count their English talk delightsome melody;
6822,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6823,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And seat me on a bank, and draw them near,"
6824,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That I may feast myself with hearing it,"
6825,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Till shortly they forget their bashful fear,"
6826,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Push back their flaxen curls, and round me sit--"
6827,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Tell me their names, their daily tasks, and show"
6828,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Where wild wood-strawberries in the copses grow.
6829,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6830,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,So passed the day in this delightful land:
6831,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My heart was thankful for the English tongue--
6832,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,For English sky with feathery cloudlets spanned--
6833,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,For English hedge with glistening dewdrops hung.
6834,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I journeyed, and at glowing eventide"
6835,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Stopped at a rustic inn by the wayside.
6836,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6837,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That night I slumbered sweetly, being right glad"
6838,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,To miss the flapping of the shrouds; but lo!
6839,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"A quiet dream of beings twain I had,"
6840,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Behind the curtain talking soft and low:
6841,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Methought I did not heed their utterance fine,"
6842,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Till one of them said, softly, ""Eglantine."""
6843,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6844,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I started up awake, 'twas silence all:"
6845,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My own fond heart had shaped that utterance clear:
6846,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And ""Ah!"" methought, ""how sweetly did it fall,"
6847,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Though but in dream, upon the listening ear!"
6848,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,How sweet from other lips the name well known--
6849,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That name, so many a year heard only from mine own!"""
6850,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6851,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I thought awhile, then slumber came to me,"
6852,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And tangled all my fancy in her maze,"
6853,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And I was drifting on a raft at sea.
6854,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The near all ocean, and the far all haze;"
6855,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Through the while polished water sharks did glide,"
6856,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And up in heaven I saw no stars to guide.
6857,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6858,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""Have mercy, God!"" but lo! my raft uprose;"
6859,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Drip, drip, I heard the water splash from it;"
6860,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"My raft had wings, and as the petrel goes,"
6861,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It skimmed the sea, then brooding seemed to sit"
6862,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The milk-white mirror, till, with sudden spring,"
6863,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,She flew straight upward like a living thing.
6864,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6865,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But strange!--I went not also in that flight,"
6866,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,For I was entering at a cavern's mouth;
6867,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Trees grew within, and screaming birds of night"
6868,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Sat on them, hiding from the torrid south."
6869,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"On, on I went, while gleaming in the dark"
6870,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Those trees with blanched leaves stood pale and stark.
6871,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6872,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The trees had flower-buds, nourished in deep night,"
6873,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And suddenly, as I went farther in,"
6874,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"They opened, and they shot out lambent light;"
6875,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Then all at once arose a railing din
6876,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That frighted me: ""It is the ghosts,"" I said,"
6877,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And they are railing for their darkness fled.
6878,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6879,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""I hope they will not look me in the face;"
6880,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It frighteth me to hear their laughter loud;"""
6881,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I saw them troop before with jaunty pace,"
6882,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And one would shake off dust that soiled her shroud:
6883,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But now, O joy unhoped! to calm my dread,"
6884,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Some moonlight filtered through a cleft o'erhead.
6885,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6886,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I climbed the lofty trees--the blanchèd trees--
6887,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The cleft was wide enough to let me through;
6888,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I clambered out and felt the balmy breeze,"
6889,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And stepped on churchyard grasses wet with dew.
6890,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O happy chance! O fortune to admire!
6891,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I stood beside my own loved village spire.
6892,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6893,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And as I gazed upon the yew-tree's trunk,"
6894,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Lo, far-off music--music in the night!"
6895,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,So sweet and tender as it swelled and sunk;
6896,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It charmed me till I wept with keen delight,"
6897,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And in my dream, methought as it drew near"
6898,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The very clouds in heaven stooped low to hear.
6899,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6900,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Beat high, beat low, wild heart so deeply stirred,"
6901,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,For high as heaven runs up the piercing strain;
6902,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The restless music fluttering like a bird
6903,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Bemoaned herself, and dropped to earth again,"
6904,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Heaping up sweetness till I was afraid
6905,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,That I should die of grief when it did fade.
6906,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6907,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And it DID fade; but while with eager ear
6908,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I drank its last long echo dying away,"
6909,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I was aware of footsteps that drew near,"
6910,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And round the ivied chancel seemed to stray:
6911,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O soft above the hallowed place they trod--
6912,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Soft as the fall of foot that is not shod!
6913,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6914,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I turned--'twas even so--yes, Eglantine!"
6915,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,For at the first I had divined the same;
6916,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I saw the moon on her shut eyelids shine,"
6917,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And said, ""She is asleep:"" still on she came;"
6918,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Then, on her dimpled feet, I saw it gleam,"
6919,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And thought--""I know that this is but a dream."""
6920,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6921,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My darling! O my darling! not the less
6922,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My dream went on because I knew it such;
6923,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,She came towards me in her loveliness--
6924,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"A thing too pure, methought, for mortal touch;"
6925,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The rippling gold did on her bosom meet,"
6926,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The long white robe descended to her feet.
6927,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6928,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The fringèd lids dropped low, as sleep-oppressed;"
6929,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her dreamy smile was very fair to see,"
6930,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And her two hands were folded to her breast,"
6931,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With somewhat held between them heedfully.
6932,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,O fast asleep! and yet methought she knew
6933,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And felt my nearness those shut eyelids through.
6934,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6935,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,She sighed: my tears ran down for tenderness--
6936,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And have I drawn thee to me in my sleep?
6937,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Is it for me thou wanderest shelterless,"
6938,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Wetting thy steps in dewy grasses deep?
6939,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""O if this be!"" I said--""yet speak to me;"
6940,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I blame my very dream for cruelty."""
6941,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6942,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Then from her stainless bosom she did take
6943,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Two beauteous lily flowers that lay therein,"
6944,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And with slow-moving lips a gesture make,"
6945,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,As one that some forgotten words doth win:
6946,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""They floated on the pool,"" methought she said,"
6947,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And water trickled from each lily's head.
6948,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6949,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,It dropped upon her feet--I saw it gleam
6950,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Along the ripples of her yellow hair.
6951,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And stood apart, for only in a dream"
6952,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She would have come, methought, to meet me there."
6953,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"She spoke again--""Ah fair! ah fresh they shine!"
6954,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And there are many left, and these are mine."""
6955,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6956,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I answered her with flattering accents meet--
6957,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""Love, they are whitest lilies e'er were blown."""
6958,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""And sayest thou so?"" she sighed in murmurs sweet;"
6959,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""I have nought else to give thee now, mine own!"
6960,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"For it is night. Then take them, love!"" said she:"
6961,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""They have been costly flowers to thee--and me."""
6962,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6963,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"While thus she said I took them from her hand,"
6964,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And, overcome with love and nearness, woke;"
6965,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And overcome with ruth that she should stand
6966,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Barefooted in the grass; that, when she spoke,"
6967,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Her mystic words should take so sweet a tone,"
6968,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And of all names her lips should choose ""My own"""
6969,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6970,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I rose, I journeyed, neared my home, and soon"
6971,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Beheld the spire peer out above the hill.
6972,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,It was a sunny harvest afternoon.
6973,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"When by the churchyard wicket, standing still,"
6974,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I cast my eager eyes abroad to know
6975,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,If change had touched the scenes of long ago.
6976,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6977,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,I looked across the hollow; sunbeams shone
6978,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Upon the old house with the gable ends:
6979,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"""Save that the laurel trees are taller grown,"
6980,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"No change,"" methought, ""to its gray wall extends"
6981,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,What clear bright beams on yonder lattice shine!
6982,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"There did I sometime talk with Eglantine."""
6983,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6984,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"There standing with my very goal in sight,"
6985,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Over my haste did sudden quiet steal;
6986,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I thought to dally with my own delight,"
6987,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Nor rush on headlong to my garnered weal,"
6988,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But taste the sweetness of a short delay,"
6989,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And for a little moment hold the bliss at bay.
6990,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6991,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The church was open; it perchance might be
6992,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"That there to offer thanks I might essay,"
6993,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Or rather, as I think, that I might see"
6994,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,The place where Eglantine was wont to pray.
6995,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But so it was; I crossed that portal wide,"
6996,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And felt my riot joy to calm subside.
6997,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
6998,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"The low depending curtains, gently swayed,"
6999,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Cast over arch and roof a crimson glow;
7000,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But, ne'ertheless, all silence and all shade"
7001,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"It seemed, save only for the rippling flow"
7002,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Of their long foldings, when the sunset air"
7003,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Sighed through the casements of the house of prayer.
7004,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
7005,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I found her place, the ancient oaken stall,"
7006,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Where in her childhood I had seen her sit,"
7007,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Most saint-like and most tranquil there of all,"
7008,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Folding her hands, as if a dreaming fit--"
7009,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,A heavenly vision had before her strayed
7010,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Of the Eternal Child in lowly manger laid.
7011,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
7012,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I saw her prayer-book laid upon the seat,"
7013,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"And took it in my hand, and felt more near"
7014,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"in fancy to her, finding it most sweet"
7015,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"To think how very oft, low kneeling there,"
7016,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"In her devout thoughts she had let me share,"
7017,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,And set my graceless name in her pure prayer.
7018,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
7019,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,My eyes were dazzled with delightful tears--
7020,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,In sooth they were the last I ever shed;
7021,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,For with them fell the cherished dreams of years.
7022,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"I looked, and on the wall above my head,"
7023,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Over her seat, there was a tablet placed,"
7024,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,With one word only on the marble traced.--
7025,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
7026,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,
7027,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Ah well! I would not overstate that woe,"
7028,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"For I have had some blessings, little care;"
7029,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"But since the falling of that heavy blow,"
7030,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,God's earth has never seemed to me so fair;
7031,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,"Nor any of his creatures so divine,"
7032,THE FOUR BRIDGES.,Nor sleep so sweet;--the word was--EGLANTINE.

8405,I.,"For granted; there he set her with her crown,"
8406,I.,And at her first enthronement he turned out
8407,I.,"Much that was best away, for unaware"
8408,I.,His thoughts grew noble. She was always there
8409,I.,"And knew it not, and he grew like to her"
8410,I.,And like to what he thought her.
8411,I.,Now he dwelt
8412,I.,"With kin that loved him well,--two fine old folk,"
8413,I.,"A rich, right honest yeoman, and his dame,--"
8414,I.,"Their only grandson he, their pride, their heir."
8415,I.,
8416,I.,"To these, one daughter had been born, one child,"
8417,I.,"And as she grew to woman, ""Look,"" they said,"
8418,I.,"""She must not leave us; let us build a wing,"
8419,I.,"With cheerful rooms and wide, to our old grange;"
8420,I.,"There may she dwell, with her good man, and all"
8421,I.,"God sends them."" Then the girl in her first youth"
8422,I.,"Married a curate,--handsome, poor in purse,"
8423,I.,"Of gentle blood and manners, and he lived"
8424,I.,"Under her father's roof, as they had planned."
8425,I.,
8426,I.,"Full soon, for happy years are short, they filled"
8427,I.,The house with children; four were born to them.
8428,I.,Then came a sickly season; fever spread
8429,I.,"Among the poor. The curate, never slack"
8430,I.,"In duty, praying by the sick, or worse,"
8431,I.,"Burying the dead, when all the air was clogged"
8432,I.,"With poisonous mist, was stricken; long he lay"
8433,I.,"Sick, almost to the death, and when his head"
8434,I.,"He lifted from the pillow, there was left"
8435,I.,"One only of that pretty flock: his girls,"
8436,I.,"His three, were cold beneath the sod; his boy,"
8437,I.,"Their eldest born, remained."
8438,I.,
8439,I.,The drooping wife
8440,I.,"Bore her great sorrow in such quiet wise,"
8441,I.,"That first they marvelled at her, then they tried"
8442,I.,"To rouse her, showing her their bitter grief,"
8443,I.,"Lamenting, and not sparing; but she sighed,"
8444,I.,"""Let me alone, it will not be for long."""
8445,I.,"Then did her mother tremble, murmuring out,"
8446,I.,"""Dear child, the best of comfort will be soon."
8447,I.,"O, when you see this other little face,"
8448,I.,"You will, please God, be comforted."""
8449,I.,
8450,I.,"She said,"
8451,I.,"""I shall not live to see it""; but she did,--"
8452,I.,"little sickly face, a wan, thin face."
8453,I.,"Then she grew eager, and her eyes were bright"
8454,I.,"When she would plead with them: ""Take me away,"
8455,I.,Let me go south; it is the bitter blast
8456,I.,That chills my tender babe; she cannot thrive
8457,I.,"Under the desolate, dull, mournful cloud."""
8458,I.,"Then all they journeyed south together, mute"
8459,I.,"With past and coming sorrow, till the sun,"
8460,I.,"In gardens edging the blue tideless main,"
8461,I.,"Warmed them and calmed the aching at their hearts,"
8462,I.,And all went better for a while; but not
8463,I.,For long. They sitting by the orange-trees
8464,I.,"Once rested, and the wife was very still:"
8465,I.,One woman with narcissus flowers heaped up
8466,I.,"Let down her basket from her head, but paused"
8467,I.,"With pitying gesture, and drew near and stooped,"
8468,I.,"Taking a white wild face upon her breast,--"
8469,I.,"The little babe on its poor mother's knees,"
8470,I.,"None marking it, none knowing else, had died."
8471,I.,
8472,I.,"The fading mother could not stay behind,"
8473,I.,Her heart was broken; but it awed them most
8474,I.,"To feel they must not, dared not, pray for life,"
8475,I.,"Seeing she longed to go, and went so gladly."
8476,I.,
8477,I.,"After, these three, who loved each other well,"
8478,I.,"Brought their one child away, and they were best"
8479,I.,Together in the wide old grange. Full oft
8480,I.,"The father with the mother talked of her,"
8481,I.,"Their daughter, but the husband nevermore;"
8482,I.,"He looked for solace in his work, and gave"
8483,I.,"His mind to teach his boy. And time went on,"
8484,I.,Until the grandsire prayed those other two
8485,I.,"""Now part with him; it must be; for his good:"
8486,I.,"He rules and knows it; choose for him a school,"
8487,I.,"Let him have all advantages, and all"
8488,I.,"Good training that should make a gentleman."""
8489,I.,
8490,I.,"With that they parted from their boy, and lived"
8491,I.,"Longing between his holidays, and time"
8492,I.,Sped; he grew on till he had eighteen years.
8493,I.,"His father loved him, wished to make of him"
8494,I.,Another parson; but the farmer's wife
8495,I.,"Murmured at that: ""No, no, they learned bad ways,"
8496,I.,They ran in debt at college; she had heard
8497,I.,That many rued the day they sent their boys
8498,I.,"To college""; and between the two broke in"
8499,I.,"His grandsire: ""Find a sober, honest man,"
8500,I.,"A scholar, for our lad should see the world"
8501,I.,"While he is young, that he may marry young."
8502,I.,He will not settle and be satisfied
8503,I.,Till he has run about the world awhile.
8504,I.,"Good lack, I longed to travel in my youth,"
8505,I.,"And had no chance to do it. Send him off,"
8506,I.,"A sober man being found to trust him with,"
8507,I.,"One with the fear of God before his eyes."""
8508,I.,And he prevailed; the careful father chose
8509,I.,"A tutor, young,--the worthy matron thought,--"
8510,I.,"In truth, not ten years older than her boy,"
8511,I.,"And glad as he to range, and keen for snows,"
8512,I.,"Desert, and ocean. And they made strange choice"
8513,I.,"Of where to go, left the sweet day behind,"
8514,I.,"And pushed up north in whaling ships, to feel"
8515,I.,"What cold was, see the blowing whale come up,"
8516,I.,"And Arctic creatures, while a scarlet sun"
8517,I.,"Went round and round, crowd on the clear blue berg."
8518,I.,
8519,I.,Then did the trappers have them; and they heard
8520,I.,Nightly the whistling calls of forest-men
8521,I.,That mocked the forest wonners; and they saw
8522,I.,"Over the open, raging up like doom,"
8523,I.,"The dangerous dust-cloud, that was full of eyes,--"
8524,I.,The bisons. So were three years gone like one;
8525,I.,"And the old cities drew them for a while,"
8526,I.,"Great mothers, by the Tiber and the Seine;"
8527,I.,"They have hid many sons hard by their seats,"
8528,I.,"But all the air is stirring with them still,"
8529,I.,"The waters murmur of them, skies at eve"
8530,I.,"Are stained with their rich blood, and every sound"
8531,I.,Means men.
8532,I.,"At last, the fourth year running out,"
8533,I.,The youth came home. And all the cheerful house
8534,I.,"Was decked in fresher colors, and the dame"
8535,I.,Was full of joy. But in the father's heart
8536,I.,"Abode a painful doubt. ""It is not well;"
8537,I.,He cannot spend his life with dog and gun.
8538,I.,I do not care that my one son should sleep
8539,I.,"Merely for keeping him in breath, and wake"
8540,I.,"Only to ride to cover."""
8541,I.,Not the less
8542,I.,"The grandsire pondered. ""Ay, the boy must WORK"
8543,I.,Or SPEND; and I must let him spend; just stay
8544,I.,"Awhile with us, and then from time to time"
8545,I.,Have leave to be away with those fine folk
8546,I.,"With whom, these many years, at school, and now,"
8547,I.,"During his sojourn in the foreign towns,"
8548,I.,"He has been made familiar."" Thus a month"
8549,I.,"Went by. They liked the stirring ways of youth,"
8550,I.,"The quick elastic step, and joyous mind,"
8551,I.,"Ever expectant of it knew not what,"
8552,I.,But something higher than has e'er been born
8553,I.,Of easy slumber and sweet competence.
8554,I.,"And as for him,--the while they thought and thought"
8555,I.,A comfortable instinct let him know
8556,I.,"How they had waited for him, to complete"
8557,I.,And give a meaning to their lives; and still
8558,I.,"At home, but with a sense of newness there,"
8559,I.,"And frank and fresh as in the school-boy days,"
8560,I.,"He oft--invading of his father's haunts,"
8561,I.,The study where he passed the silent morn--
8562,I.,"Would sit, devouring with a greedy joy"
8563,I.,"The piled-up books, uncut as yet; or wake"
8564,I.,"To guide with him by night the tube, and search,"
8565,I.,"Ay, think to find new stars; then risen betimes,"
8566,I.,"Would ride about the farm, and list the talk"
8567,I.,Of his hale grandsire.
8568,I.,"But a day came round,"
8569,I.,"When, after peering in his mother's room,"
8570,I.,"Shaded and shuttered from the light, he oped"
8571,I.,"A door, and found the rosy grandmother"
8572,I.,"Ensconced and happy in her special pride,"
8573,I.,"Her storeroom. She was corking syrups rare,"
8574,I.,And fruits all sparkling in a crystal coat.
8575,I.,"Here after choice of certain cates well known,"
8576,I.,"He, sitting on her bacon-chest at ease,"
8577,I.,"Sang as he watched her, till right suddenly,"
8578,I.,"As if a new thought came, ""Goody,"" quoth he,"
8579,I.,"""What, think you, do they want to do with me?"
8580,I.,"What have they planned for me that I should do?"""
8581,I.,
8582,I.,"""Do, laddie!"" quoth she faltering, half in tears;"
8583,I.,"""Are you not happy with us, not content?"
8584,I.,Why would ye go away? There is no need
8585,I.,"That ye should DO at all. O, bide at home."
8586,I.,"Have we not plenty?"""
8587,I.,"""Even so,"" he said;"
8588,I.,"""I did not wish to go."""
8589,I.,"""Nay, then,"" quoth she,"
8590,I.,"""Be idle; let me see your blessed face."
8591,I.,"What, is the horse your father chose for you"
8592,I.,"Not to your mind? He is? Well, well, remain;"
8593,I.,"Do as you will, so you but do it here."
8594,I.,"You shall not want for money."""
8595,I.,"But, his arms"
8596,I.,"Folding, he sat and twisted up his mouth"
8597,I.,With comical discomfiture.
8598,I.,"""What, then,"""
8599,I.,"She sighed, ""what is it, child, that you would like?"""
8600,I.,"""Why,"" said he, ""farming."""
8601,I.,"And she looked at him,"
8602,I.,"Fond, foolish woman that she was, to find"
8603,I.,"Some fitness in the worker for the work,"
8604,I.,And she found none. A certain grace there was
8605,I.,"Of movement, and a beauty in the face,"
8606,I.,Sun-browned and healthful beauty that had come
8607,I.,"From his grave father; and she thought, ""Good lack,"
8608,I.,A farmer! he is fitter for a duke.
8609,I.,"He walks; why, how he walks! if I should meet"
8610,I.,"One like him, whom I knew not, I should ask,"
8611,I.,"'And who may that be?'"" So the foolish thought"
8612,I.,"Found words. Quoth she, half laughing, half ashamed,"
8613,I.,"""We planned to make of you--a gentleman."""
8614,I.,And with engaging sweet audacity
8615,I.,"She thought it nothing less,--he, looking up,"
8616,I.,"With a smile in his blue eyes, replied to her,"
8617,I.,"""And hav'n't you done it?"" Quoth she, lovingly,"
8618,I.,"""I think we have, laddie; I think we have."""
8619,I.,
8620,I.,"""Then,"" quoth he, ""I may do what best I like;"
8621,I.,"It makes no matter. Goody, you were wise"
8622,I.,"To help me in it, and to let me farm;"
8623,I.,"I think of getting into mischief else!"""
8624,I.,"""No! do ye, laddie?"" quoth the dame, and laughed."
8625,I.,"""But ask my grandfather,"" the youth went on,"
8626,I.,"""To let me have the farm he bought last year,"
8627,I.,"The little one, to manage. I like land;"
8628,I.,"I want some."" And she, womanlike, gave way"
8629,I.,"Convinced; and promised, and made good her word,"
8630,I.,"And that same night upon the matter spoke,"
8631,I.,In presence of the father and the son.
8632,I.,
8633,I.,"""Roger,"" quoth she, ""our Laurance wants to farm;"
8634,I.,"I think he might do worse."" The father sat"
8635,I.,Mute but right glad. The grandson breaking in
8636,I.,Set all his wish and his ambition forth;
8637,I.,"But cunningly the old man hid his joy,"
8638,I.,And made conditions with a faint demur.
8639,I.,"Then pausing, ""Let your father speak,"" quoth he;"
8640,I.,"""I am content if he is"": at his word"
8641,I.,"The parson took him, ay, and, parson like,"
8642,I.,"Put a religious meaning in the work,"
8643,I.,"Man's earliest work, and wished his son God speed."
8644,I.,
8645,I.,
8646,II.,II.
8647,II.,
8648,II.,"Thus all were satisfied, and day by day,"
8649,II.,For two sweet years a happy course was theirs;
8650,II.,"Happy, but yet the fortunate, the young"
8651,II.,"Loved, and much cared-for, entered on his strife,--"
8652,II.,"A stirring of the heart, a quickening keen"
8653,II.,Of sight and hearing to the delicate
8654,II.,Beauty and music of an altered world;
8655,II.,Began to walk in that mysterious light
8656,II.,Which doth reveal and yet transform; which gives
8657,II.,"Destiny, sorrow, youth, and death, and life,"
8658,II.,Intenser meaning; in disquieting
8659,II.,Lifts up; a shining light: men call it Love.
8660,II.,
8661,II.,"Fair, modest eyes had she, the girl he loved;"
8662,II.,"A silent creature, thoughtful, grave, sincere."
8663,II.,"She never turned from him with sweet caprice,"
8664,II.,"Nor changing moved his soul to troublous hope,"
8665,II.,"Nor dropped for him her heavy lashes low,"
8666,II.,But excellent in youthful grace came up;
8667,II.,"And ere his words were ready, passing on,"
8668,II.,Had left him all a-tremble; yet made sure
8669,II.,"That by her own true will, and fixed intent,"
8670,II.,"She held him thus remote. Therefore, albeit"
8671,II.,"He knew she did not love him, yet so long"
8672,II.,"As of a rival unaware, he dwelt"
8673,II.,"All in the present, without fear, or hope,"
8674,II.,"Enthralled and whelmed in the deep sea of love,"
8675,II.,And could not get his head above its wave
8676,II.,"To reach the far horizon, or to mark"
8677,II.,Whereto it drifted him.
8678,II.,"So long, so long;"
8679,II.,"Then, on a sudden, came the ruthless fate,"
8680,II.,"Showed him a bitter truth, and brought him bale"
8681,II.,All in the tolling out of noon.
8682,II.,'Twas thus:
8683,II.,Snow-time was come; it had been snowing hard;
8684,II.,Across the churchyard path he walked; the clock
8685,II.,"Began to strike, and, as he passed the porch,"
8686,II.,"Half turning, through a sense that came to him"
8687,II.,"As of some presence in it, he beheld"
8688,II.,"His love, and she had come for shelter there;"
8689,II.,"And all her face was fair with rosy bloom,"
8690,II.,The blush of happiness; and one held up
8691,II.,"Her ungloved hand in both his own, and stooped"
8692,II.,"Toward it, sitting by her. O her eyes"
8693,II.,Were full of peace and tender light: they looked
8694,II.,One moment in the ungraced lover's face
8695,II.,While he was passing in the snow; and he
8696,II.,"Received the story, while he raised his hat"
8697,II.,"Retiring. Then the clock left off to strike,"
8698,II.,"And that was all. It snowed, and he walked on;"
8699,II.,"And in a certain way he marked the snow,"
8700,II.,"And walked, and came upon the open heath;"
8701,II.,"And in a certain way he marked the cold,"
8702,II.,And walked as one that had no starting-place
8703,II.,"Might walk, but not to any certain goal."
8704,II.,
8705,II.,"And he strode on toward a hollow part,"
8706,II.,"Where from the hillside gravel had been dug,"
8707,II.,"And he was conscious of a cry, and went"
8708,II.,"Dulled in his sense, as though he heard it not;"
8709,II.,"Till a small farmhouse drudge, a half-grown girl,"
8710,II.,Rose from the shelter of a drift that lay
8711,II.,"Against the bushes, crying, ""God! O God,"
8712,II.,"O my good God, He sends us help at last."""
8713,II.,
8714,II.,"Then looking hard upon her, came to him"
8715,II.,The power to feel and to perceive. Her teeth
8716,II.,"Chattered, and all her limbs with shuddering failed,"
8717,II.,And in her threadbare shawl was wrapped a child
8718,II.,"That looked on him with wondering, wistful eyes."
8719,II.,
8720,II.,"""I thought to freeze,"" the girl broke out with tears;"
8721,II.,"""Kind sir, kind sir,"" and she held out the child,"
8722,II.,As praying him to take it; and he did;
8723,II.,"And gave to her the shawl, and swathed his charge"
8724,II.,In the foldings of his plaid; and when it thrust
8725,II.,"Its small round face against his breast, and felt"
8726,II.,"With small red hands for warmth,--unbearable"
8727,II.,"Pains of great pity rent his straitened heart,"
8728,II.,For the poor upland dwellers had been out
8729,II.,"Since morning dawn, at early milking-time,"
8730,II.,"Wandering and stumbling in the drift. And now,"
8731,II.,"Lamed with a fall, half crippled by the cold,"
8732,II.,"Hardly prevailed his arm to drag her on,"
8733,II.,"That ill-clad child, who yet the younger child"
8734,II.,Had motherly cared to shield. So toiling through
8735,II.,"The great white storm coming, and coming yet."
8736,II.,And coming till the world confounded sat
8737,II.,"With all her fair familiar features gone,"
8738,II.,"The mountains muffled in an eddying swirl,"
8739,II.,"He led or bore them, and the little one"
8740,II.,"Peered from her shelter, pleased; but oft would mourn"
8741,II.,"The elder, ""They will beat me: O my can,"
8742,II.,"I left my can of milk upon the moor."""
8743,II.,"And he compared her trouble with his own,"
8744,II.,And had no heart to speak. And yet 'twas keen;
8745,II.,It filled her to the putting down of pain
8746,II.,"And hunger,--what could his do more?"
8747,II.,He brought
8748,II.,"The children to their home, and suddenly"
8749,II.,"Regained himself, and wondering at himself,"
8750,II.,"That he had borne, and yet been dumb so long,"
8751,II.,The weary wailing of the girl: he paid
8752,II.,"Money to buy her pardon; heard them say,"
8753,II.,"""Peace, we have feared for you; forget the milk,"
8754,II.,"It is no matter!"" and went forth again"
8755,II.,"And waded in the snow, and quietly"
8756,II.,Considered in his patience what to do
8757,II.,With all the dull remainder of his days.
8758,II.,
8759,II.,"With dusk he was at home, and felt it good"
8760,II.,"To hear his kindred talking, for it broke"
8761,II.,"A mocking, endless echo in his soul,"
8762,II.,"""It is no matter!"" and he could not choose"
8763,II.,"But mutter, though the weariness o'ercame"
8764,II.,"His spirit, ""Peace, it is no matter; peace,"
8765,II.,"It is no matter!"" For he felt that all"
8766,II.,"Was as it had been, and his father's heart"
8767,II.,"Was easy, knowing not how that same day"
8768,II.,Hope with her tender colors and delight
8769,II.,(He should not care to have him know) were dead;
8770,II.,"Yea, to all these, his nearest and most dear,"
8771,II.,It was no matter. And he heard them talk
8772,II.,"Of timber felled, of certain fruitful fields,"
8773,II.,And profitable markets.
8774,II.,All for him
8775,II.,"Their plans, and yet the echoes swarmed and swam"
8776,II.,"About his head, whenever there was pause;"
8777,II.,"""It is no matter!"" And his greater self"
8778,II.,"Arose in him and fought. ""It matters much,"
8779,II.,"It matters all to these, that not to-day"
8780,II.,Nor ever they should know it. I will hide
8781,II.,"The wound; ay, hide it with a sleepless care."
8782,II.,"What! shall I make these three to drink of rue,"
8783,II.,"Because my cup is bitter?"" And he thrust"
8784,II.,"Himself in thought away, and made his ears"
8785,II.,"Hearken, and caused his voice, that yet did seem"
8786,II.,"Another, to make answer, when they spoke,"
8787,II.,"As there had been no snowstorm, and no porch,"
8788,II.,And no despair.
8789,II.,So this went on awhile
8790,II.,"Until the snow had melted from the wold,"
8791,II.,"And he, one noonday, wandering up a lane,"
8792,II.,Met on a turn the woman whom he loved.
8793,II.,"Then, even to trembling he was moved: his speech"
8794,II.,Faltered; but when the common kindly words
8795,II.,"Of greeting were all said, and she passed on,"
8796,II.,"He could not bear her sweetness and his pain,"
8797,II.,"""Muriel!"" he cried; and when she heard her name,"
8798,II.,"She turned. ""You know I love you,"" he broke out:"
8799,II.,"She answered ""Yes,"" and sighed."
8800,II.,"""O pardon me."
8801,II.,"Pardon me,"" quoth the lover; ""let me rest"
8802,II.,"In certainty, and hear it from your mouth:"
8803,II.,Is he with whom I saw you once of late
8804,II.,"To call you wife?"" ""I hope so,"" she replied;"
8805,II.,"And over all her face the rose-bloom came,"
8806,II.,"As thinking on that other, unaware"
8807,II.,"Her eyes waxed tender. When he looked on her,"
8808,II.,"Standing to answer him, with lovely shame,"
8809,II.,"Submiss, and yet not his, a passionate,"
8810,II.,A quickened sense of his great impotence
8811,II.,To drive away the doom got hold on him;
8812,II.,He set his teeth to force the unbearable
8813,II.,"Misery back, his wide-awakened eyes"
8814,II.,Flashed as with flame.
8815,II.,"And she, all overawed"
8816,II.,"And mastered by his manhood, waited yet,"
8817,II.,And trembled at the deep she could not sound;
8818,II.,A passionate nature in a storm; a heart
8819,II.,"Wild with a mortal pain, and in the grasp"
8820,II.,Of an immortal love.
8821,II.,"""Farewell,"" he said,"
8822,II.,"Recovering words, and when she gave her hand,"
8823,II.,"""My thanks for your good candor; for I feel"
8824,II.,"That it has cost you something."" Then, the blush"
8825,II.,"Yet on her face, she said: ""It was your due:"
8826,II.,"But keep this matter from your friends and kin,"
8827,II.,"We would not have it known."" Then cold and proud,"
8828,II.,"Because there leaped from under his straight lids,"
8829,II.,"And instantly was veiled, a keen surprise,--"
8830,II.,"""He wills it, and I therefore think it well."""
8831,II.,"Thereon they parted; but from that time forth,"
8832,II.,"Whether they met on festal eve, in field,"
8833,II.,"Or at the church, she ever bore herself"
8834,II.,"Proudly, for she had felt a certain pain,"
8835,II.,The disapproval hastily betrayed
8836,II.,"And quickly hidden hurt her. ""'T was a grace,"""
8837,II.,"She thought, ""to tell this man the thing he asked,"
8838,II.,And he rewards me with surprise. I like
8839,II.,"No one's surprise, and least of all bestowed"
8840,II.,"Where he bestowed it."""
8841,II.,But the spring came on:
8842,II.,Looking to wed in April all her thoughts
8843,II.,Grew loving; she would fain the world had waxed
8844,II.,"More happy with her happiness, and oft"
8845,II.,Walking among the flowery woods she felt
8846,II.,"Their loveliness reach down into her heart,"
8847,II.,"And knew with them the ecstasies of growth,"
8848,II.,"The rapture that was satisfied with light,"
8849,II.,The pleasure of the leaf in exquisite
8850,II.,"Expansion, through the lovely longed-for spring."
8851,II.,
8852,II.,"And as for him,--(Some narrow hearts there are"
8853,II.,That suffer blight when that they fed upon
8854,II.,"As something to complete their being fails,"
8855,II.,"And they retire into their holds and pine,"
8856,II.,"And long restrained grow stern. But some there are,"
8857,II.,"That in a sacred want and hunger rise,"
8858,II.,"And draw the misery home and live with it,"
8859,II.,"And excellent in honor wait, and will"
8860,II.,"That somewhat good should yet be found in it,"
8861,II.,"Else wherefore were they born?),--and as for him,"
8862,II.,"He loved her, but his peace and welfare made"
8863,II.,The sunshine of three lives. The cheerful grange
8864,II.,Threw open wide its hospitable doors
8865,II.,"And drew in guests for him. The garden flowers,"
8866,II.,"Sweet budding wonders, all were set for him."
8867,II.,"In him the eyes at home were satisfied,"
8868,II.,And if he did but laugh the ear approved.
8869,II.,"What then? He dwelt among them as of old,"
8870,II.,And taught his mouth to smile.
8871,II.,"And time went on,"
8872,II.,"Till on a morning, when the perfect spring"
8873,II.,"Rested among her leaves, he journeying home"
8874,II.,"After short sojourn in a neighboring town,"
8875,II.,Stopped at the little station on the line
8876,II.,That ran between his woods; a lonely place
8877,II.,"And quiet, and a woman and a child"
8878,II.,"Got out. He noted them, but walking on"
8879,II.,"Quickly, went back into the wood, impelled"
8880,II.,"By hope, for, passing, he had seen his love,"
8881,II.,And she was sitting on a rustic seat
8882,II.,"That overlooked the line, and he desired"
8883,II.,With longing indescribable to look
8884,II.,Upon her face again. And he drew near.
8885,II.,She was right happy; she was waiting there.
8886,II.,He felt that she was waiting for her lord.
8887,II.,"She cared no whit if Laurance went or stayed,"
8888,II.,"But answered when he spoke, and dropped her cheek"
8889,II.,In her fair hand.
8890,II.,"And he, not able yet"
8891,II.,"To force himself away, and never more"
8892,II.,"Behold her, gathered blossom, primrose flowers,"
8893,II.,"And wild anemone, for many a clump"
8894,II.,"Grew all about him, and the hazel rods"
8895,II.,Were nodding with their catkins. But he heard
8896,II.,"The stopping train, and felt that he must go;"
8897,II.,His time was come. There was nought else to do
8898,II.,Or hope for. With the blossom he drew near
8899,II.,And would have had her take it from his hand;
8900,II.,"But she, half lost in thought, held out her own,"
8901,II.,"And then remembering him and his long love,"
8902,II.,"She said, ""I thank you; pray you now forget,"
8903,II.,"Forget me, Laurance,"" and her lovely eyes"
8904,II.,"Softened; but he was dumb, till through the trees"
8905,II.,Suddenly broke upon their quietude
8906,II.,"The woman and her child. And Muriel said,"
8907,II.,"""What will you?"" She made answer quick and keen,"
8908,II.,"""Your name, my lady; 'tis your name I want,"
8909,II.,"Tell me your name."" Not startled, not displeased,"
8910,II.,"But with a musing sweetness on her mouth,"
8911,II.,As if considering in how short a while
8912,II.,"It would be changed, she lifted up her face"
8913,II.,"And gave it, and the little child drew near"
8914,II.,"And pulled her gown, and prayed her for the flowers."
8915,II.,"Then Laurance, not content to leave them so,"
8916,II.,"Nor yet to wait the coming lover, spoke,--"
8917,II.,"""Your errand with this lady?""--""And your right"
8918,II.,"To ask it?"" she broke out with sudden heat"
8919,II.,"And passion: ""What is that to you! Poor child!"
8920,II.,"Madam!"" And Muriel lifted up her face"
8921,II.,"And looked,--they looked into each other's eyes."
8922,II.,
8923,II.,"""That man who comes,"" the clear-voiced woman cried,"
8924,II.,"""That man with whom you think to wed so soon,"
8925,II.,You must not heed him. What! the world is full
8926,II.,"Of men, and some are good, and most, God knows,"
8927,II.,"Better than he,--that I should say it!--far"
8928,II.,"Better."" And down her face the large tears ran,"
8929,II.,"And Muriel's wild dilated eyes looked up,"
8930,II.,Taking a terrible meaning from her words;
8931,II.,And Laurance stared about him half in doubt
8932,II.,"If this were real, for all things were so blithe,"
8933,II.,And soft air tossed the little flowers about;
8934,II.,"The child was singing, and the blackbirds piped,"
8935,II.,Glad in fair sunshine. And the women both
8936,II.,"Were quiet, gazing in each other's eyes."
8937,II.,
8938,II.,"He found his voice, and spoke: ""This is not well,"
8939,II.,Though whom you speak of should have done you wrong;
8940,II.,A man that could desert and plan to wed
8941,II.,"Will not his purpose yield to God and right,"
8942,II.,"Only to law. You, whom I pity so much,"
8943,II.,"If you be come this day to urge a claim,"
8944,II.,You will not tell me that your claim will hold;
8945,II.,"'Tis only, if I read aright, the old,"
8946,II.,"Sorrowful, hateful story!"""
8947,II.,"Muriel sighed,"
8948,II.,"With a dull patience that he marvelled at,"
8949,II.,"""Be plain with me. I know not what to think,"
8950,II.,Unless you are his wife. Are you his wife?
8951,II.,"Be plain with me."" And all too quietly,"
8952,II.,"With running down of tears, the answer came,"
8953,II.,"""Ay, madam, ay! the worse for him and me."""
8954,II.,"Then Muriel heard her lover's foot anear,"
8955,II.,"And cried upon him with a bitter cry,"
8956,II.,"Sharp and despairing. And those two stood back,"
8957,II.,"With such affright, and violent anger stirred"
8958,II.,"He broke from out the thicket to her side,"
8959,II.,"Not knowing. But, her hands before her face,"
8960,II.,"She sat; and, stepping close, that woman came"
8961,II.,"And faced him. Then said Muriel, ""O my heart,"
8962,II.,"Herbert!""--and he was dumb, and ground his teeth,"
8963,II.,"And lifted up his hand and looked at it,"
8964,II.,And at the woman; but a man was there
8965,II.,"Who whirled her from her place, and thrust himself"
8966,II.,"Between them; he was strong,--a stalwart man:"
8967,II.,"And Herbert thinking on it, knew his name."
8968,II.,"""What good,"" quoth he, ""though you and I should strive"
8969,II.,"And wrestle all this April day? A word,"
8970,II.,"And not a blow, is what these women want:"
8971,II.,"Master yourself, and say it."" But he, weak"
8972,II.,"With passion and great anguish, flung himself"
8973,II.,"Upon the seat and cried, ""O lost, my love!"
8974,II.,"O Muriel, Muriel!"" And the woman spoke,"
8975,II.,"""Sir, 'twas an evil day you wed with me;"
8976,II.,"And you were young; I know it, sir, right well."
8977,II.,"Sir, I have worked; I have not troubled you,"
8978,II.,"Not for myself, nor for your child. I know"
8979,II.,"We are not equal."" ""Hold!"" he cried; ""have done;"
8980,II.,"Your still, tame words are worse than hate or scorn."
8981,II.,"Get from me! Ay, my wife, my wife, indeed!"
8982,II.,"All's done. You hear it, Muriel; if you can,"
8983,II.,"O sweet, forgive me."""
8984,II.,Then the woman moved
8985,II.,Slowly away: her little singing child
8986,II.,"Went in her wake: and Muriel dropped her hands,"
8987,II.,"And sat before these two that loved her so,"
8988,II.,"Mute and unheeding. There were angry words,"
8989,II.,"She knew, but yet she could not hear the words;"
8990,II.,And afterwards the man she loved stooped down
8991,II.,"And kissed her forehead once, and then withdrew"
8992,II.,"To look at her, and with a gesture pray"
8993,II.,"Her pardon. And she tried to speak, but failed,"
8994,II.,"And presently, and soon, O,--he was gone."
8995,II.,
8996,II.,"She heard him go, and Laurance, still as stone,"
8997,II.,Remained beside her; and she put her hand
8998,II.,"Before her face again, and afterward"
8999,II.,"She heard a voice, as if a long way off,"
9000,II.,"Some one entreated, but she could not heed."
9001,II.,"Thereon he drew her hand away, and raised"
9002,II.,Her passive from her seat. So then she knew
9003,II.,"That he would have her go with him, go home,--"
9004,II.,"It was not far to go,--a dreary home."
9005,II.,"A crippled aunt, of birth and lineage high,"
9006,II.,"Had in her youth, and for a place and home,"
9007,II.,Married the stern old rector; and the girl
9008,II.,"Dwelt with them: she was orphaned,--had no kin"
9009,II.,"Nearer than they. And Laurance brought her in,"
9010,II.,And spared to her the telling of this woe.
9011,II.,"He sought her kindred where they sat apart,"
9012,II.,"And laid before them all the cruel thing,"
9013,II.,"As he had seen it. After, he retired:"
9014,II.,"And restless, and not master of himself,"
9015,II.,He day and night haunted the rectory lanes;
9016,II.,"And all things, even to the spreading out"
9017,II.,"Of leaves, their flickering shadows on the ground,"
9018,II.,"Or sailing of the slow, white cloud, or peace"
9019,II.,"And glory and great light on mountain heads,--"
9020,II.,"All things were leagued against him,--ministered"
9021,II.,By likeness or by contrast to his love.
9022,II.,
9023,II.,"But what was that to Muriel, though her peace"
9024,II.,"He would have purchased for her with all prayers,"
9025,II.,"And costly, passionate, despairing tears?"
9026,II.,O what to her that he should find it worse
9027,II.,To bear her life's undoing than his own?
9028,II.,
9029,II.,"She let him see her, and she made no moan,"
9030,II.,"But talked full calmly of indifferent things,"
9031,II.,"Which when he heard, and marked the faded eyes"
9032,II.,"And lovely wasted cheek, he started up"
9033,II.,"With ""This I cannot bear!"" and shamed to feel"
9034,II.,"His manhood giving way, and utterly"
9035,II.,"Subdued by her sweet patience and his pain,"
9036,II.,"Made haste and from the window sprang, and paced,"
9037,II.,"Battling and chiding with himself, the maze."
9038,II.,
9039,II.,"She suffered, and he could not make her well"
9040,II.,For all his loving;--he was naught to her.
9041,II.,"And now his passionate nature, set astir,"
9042,II.,Fought with the pain that could not be endured;
9043,II.,And like a wild thing suddenly aware
9044,II.,"That it is caged, which flings and bruises all"
9045,II.,"Its body at the bars, he rose, and raged"
9046,II.,Against the misery: then he made all worse
9047,II.,"With tears. But when he came to her again,"
9048,II.,"Willing to talk as they had talked before,"
9049,II.,"She sighed, and said, with that strange quietness,"
9050,II.,"""I know you have been crying"": and she bent"
9051,II.,Her own fair head and wept.
9052,II.,She felt the cold--
9053,II.,The freezing cold that deadened all her life--
9054,II.,Give way a little; for this passionate
9055,II.,"Sorrow, and all for her, relieved her heart,"
9056,II.,"And brought some natural warmth, some natural tears."
9057,II.,
9058,II.,
9059,III.,III.
9060,III.,
9061,III.,"And after that, though oft he sought her door,"
9062,III.,"He might not see her. First they said to him,"
9063,III.,"""She is not well""; and afterwards, ""Her wish"
9064,III.,"Is ever to be quiet."" Then in haste"
9065,III.,"They took her from the place, because so fast"
9066,III.,"She faded. As for him, though youth and strength"
9067,III.,"Can bear the weight as of a world, at last"
9068,III.,"The burden of it tells,--he heard it said,"
9069,III.,"When autumn came, ""The poor sweet thing will die:"
9070,III.,"That shock was mortal."" And he cared no more"
9071,III.,"To hide, if yet he could have hidden, the blight"
9072,III.,That was laying waste his heart. He journeyed south
9073,III.,"To Devon, where she dwelt with other kin,"
9074,III.,"Good, kindly women; and he wrote to them,"
9075,III.,Praying that he might see her ere she died.
9076,III.,
9077,III.,So in her patience she permitted him
9078,III.,"To be about her, for it eased his heart;"
9079,III.,"And as for her that was to die so soon,"
9080,III.,What did it signify? She let him weep
9081,III.,"Some passionate tears beside her couch, she spoke"
9082,III.,"Pitying words, and then they made him go,"
9083,III.,"It was enough they said, her time was short,"
9084,III.,"And he had seen her. He HAD seen, and felt"
9085,III.,"The bitterness of death; but he went home,"
9086,III.,"Being satisfied in that great longing now,"
9087,III.,And able to endure what might befall.
9088,III.,
9089,III.,"And Muriel lay, and faded with the year;"
9090,III.,"She lay at the door of death, that opened not"
9091,III.,To take her in; for when the days once more
9092,III.,"Began a little to increase, she felt,--"
9093,III.,"And it was sweet to her, she was so young,--"
9094,III.,"She felt a longing for the time of flowers,"
9095,III.,And dreamed that she was walking in that wood
9096,III.,With her two feet among the primroses.
9097,III.,
9098,III.,"Then when the violet opened, she rose up"
9099,III.,And walked: the tender leaf and tender light
9100,III.,"Did solace her; but she was white and wan,"
9101,III.,"The shadow of that Muriel, in the wood"
9102,III.,Who listened to those deadly words.
9103,III.,And now
9104,III.,"Empurpled seas began to blush and bloom,"
9105,III.,"Doves made sweet moaning, and the guelder rose"
9106,III.,"In a great stillness dropped, and ever dropped,"
9107,III.,"Her wealth about her feet, and there it lay,"
9108,III.,And drifted not at all. The lilac spread
9109,III.,"Odorous essence round her; and full oft,"
9110,III.,"When Muriel felt the warmth her pulses cheer,"
9111,III.,"She, faded, sat among the Maytide bloom,"
9112,III.,"And with a reverent quiet in her soul,"
9113,III.,"Took back--it was His will--her time, and sat"
9114,III.,Learning again to live.
9115,III.,Thus as she sat
9116,III.,"Upon a day, she was aware of one"
9117,III.,Who at a distance marked her. This again
9118,III.,"Another day, and she was vexed, for yet"
9119,III.,She longed for quiet; but she heard a foot
9120,III.,"Pass once again, and beckoned through the trees."
9121,III.,"""Laurance!"" And all impatient of unrest"
9122,III.,"And strife, ay, even of the sight of them,"
9123,III.,"When he drew near, with tired, tired lips,"
9124,III.,"As if her soul upbraided him, she said,"
9125,III.,"""Why have you done this thing?"" He answered her,"
9126,III.,"""I am not always master in the fight:"
9127,III.,"I could not help it."""
9128,III.,"""What!"" she sighed, ""not yet!"
9129,III.,"O, I am sorry""; and she talked to him"
9130,III.,"As one who looked to live, imploring him,--"
9131,III.,"""Try to forget me. Let your fancy dwell"
9132,III.,"Elsewhere, nor me enrich with it so long;"
9133,III.,It wearies me to think of this your love.
9134,III.,"Forget me!"""
9135,III.,
9136,III.,"He made answer, ""I will try:"
9137,III.,"The task will take me all my life to learn,"
9138,III.,"Or were it learned, I know not how to live;"
9139,III.,"This pain is part of life and being now,--"
9140,III.,"It is myself; but yet--but I will try."""
9141,III.,"Then she spoke friendly to him,--of his home,"
9142,III.,"His father, and the old, brave, loving folk;"
9143,III.,"She bade him think of them. And not her words,"
9144,III.,"But having seen her, satisfied his heart."
9145,III.,"He left her, and went home to live his life,"
9146,III.,"And all the summer heard it said of her,"
9147,III.,"""Yet, she grows stronger""; but when autumn came"
9148,III.,Again she drooped.
9149,III.,
9150,III.,A bitter thing it is
9151,III.,To lose at once the lover and the love;
9152,III.,For who receiveth not may yet keep life
9153,III.,"In the spirit with bestowal. But for her,"
9154,III.,"This Muriel, all was gone. The man she loved,"
9155,III.,"Not only from her present had withdrawn,"
9156,III.,"But from her past, and there was no such man,"
9157,III.,There never had been.
9158,III.,
9159,III.,He was not as one
9160,III.,"Who takes love in, like some sweet bird, and holds"
9161,III.,"The winged fluttering stranger to his breast,"
9162,III.,"Till, after transient stay, all unaware"
9163,III.,It leaves him: it has flown. No; this may live
9164,III.,"In memory,--loved till death. He was not vile;"
9165,III.,"For who by choice would part with that pure bird,"
9166,III.,And lose the exaltation of its song?
9167,III.,"He had not strength of will to keep it fast,"
9168,III.,"Nor warmth of heart to keep it warm, nor life"
9169,III.,Of thought to make the echo sound for him
9170,III.,After the song was done. Pity that man:
9171,III.,"His music is all flown, and he forgets"
9172,III.,"The sweetness of it, till at last he thinks"
9173,III.,"'Twas no great matter. But he was not vile,"
9174,III.,"Only a thing to pity most in man,"
9175,III.,"Weak,--only poor, and, if he knew it, undone."
9176,III.,"But Herbert! When she mused on it, her soul"
9177,III.,"Would fain have hidden him forevermore,"
9178,III.,"Even from herself: so pure of speech, so frank,"
9179,III.,"So full of household kindness. Ah, so good"
9180,III.,"And true! A little, she had sometimes thought,"
9181,III.,"Despondent for himself, but strong of faith"
9182,III.,"In God, and faith in her, this man had seemed."
9183,III.,
9184,III.,"Ay, he was gone! and she whom he had wed,"
9185,III.,"As Muriel learned, was sick, was poor, was sad."
9186,III.,"And Muriel wrote to comfort her, and send,"
9187,III.,"From her small store, money to help her need,"
9188,III.,"With, ""Pray you keep it secret."" Then the whole"
9189,III.,Of the cruel tale was told.
9190,III.,What more? She died.
9191,III.,"Her kin, profuse of thanks, not bitterly,"
9192,III.,"Wrote of the end. ""Our sister fain had seen"
9193,III.,Her husband; prayed him sore to come. But no.
9194,III.,"And then she prayed him that he would forgive,"
9195,III.,"Madam, her breaking of the truth to you."
9196,III.,"Dear madam, he was angry, yet we think"
9197,III.,"He might have let her see, before she died,"
9198,III.,"The words she wanted, but he did not write"
9199,III.,"Till she was gone--'I neither can forgive,"
9200,III.,"Nor would I if I could.'"""
9201,III.,"""Patience, my heart!"
9202,III.,"And this, then, is the man I loved!"""
9203,III.,But yet
9204,III.,"He sought a lower level, for he wrote"
9205,III.,"Telling the story with a different hue,"
9206,III.,"Telling of freedom. He desired to come,"
9207,III.,"""For now,"" said he, ""O love, may all be well."""
9208,III.,"And she rose up against it in her soul,"
9209,III.,For she despised him. And with passionate tears
9210,III.,"Of shame, she wrote, and only wrote these words,--"
9211,III.,"""Herbert, I will not see you."""
9212,III.,Then she drooped
9213,III.,Again; it is so bitter to despise;
9214,III.,"And all her strength, when autumn leaves down dropped,"
9215,III.,"Fell from her. ""Ah!"" she thought, ""I rose up once,"
9216,III.,"I cannot rise up now; here is the end."""
9217,III.,"And all her kinsfolk thought, ""It is the end."""
9218,III.,
9219,III.,"But when that other heard, ""It is the end,"""
9220,III.,"His heart was sick, and he, as by a power"
9221,III.,"Far stronger than himself, was driven to her."
9222,III.,"Reason rebelled against it, but his will"
9223,III.,Required it of him with a craving strong
9224,III.,"As life, and passionate though hopeless pain."
9225,III.,
9226,III.,"She, when she saw his face, considered him"
9227,III.,"Full quietly, let all excuses pass"
9228,III.,"Not answered, and considered yet again."
9229,III.,
9230,III.,"""He had heard that she was sick; what could he do"
9231,III.,"But come, and ask her pardon that he came?"""
9232,III.,"What could he do, indeed?--a weak white girl"
9233,III.,Held all his heartstrings in her small white hand;
9234,III.,"His youth, and power, and majesty were hers,"
9235,III.,And not his own.
9236,III.,
9237,III.,"She looked, and pitied him."
9238,III.,"Then spoke: ""He loves me with a love that lasts."
9239,III.,"Ah, me! that I might get away from it,"
9240,III.,"Or, better, hear it said that love IS NOT,"
9241,III.,"And then I could have rest. My time is short,"
9242,III.,"I think, so short."" And roused against himself"
9243,III.,"In stormy wrath, that it should be his doom"
9244,III.,"Her to disquiet whom he loved; ay, her"
9245,III.,"For whom he would have given all his rest,"
9246,III.,If there were any left to give; he took
9247,III.,"Her words up bravely, promising once more"
9248,III.,"Absence, and praying pardon; but some tears"
9249,III.,Dropped quietly upon her cheek.
9250,III.,
9251,III.,"""Remain,"""
9252,III.,"She said, ""for there is something to be told,"
9253,III.,Some words that you must hear.
9254,III.,
9255,III.,"""And first hear this:"
9256,III.,God has been good to me; you must not think
9257,III.,That I despair. There is a quiet time
9258,III.,"Like evening in my soul. I have no heart,"
9259,III.,"For cruel Herbert killed it long ago,"
9260,III.,"And death strides on. Sit, then, and give your mind"
9261,III.,"To listen, and your eyes to look at me."
9262,III.,"Look at my face, Laurance, how white it is;"
9263,III.,"Look at my hand,--my beauty is all gone."""
9264,III.,"And Laurance lifted up his eyes; he looked,"
9265,III.,"But answered, from their deeps that held no doubt,"
9266,III.,"Far otherwise than she had willed,--they said,"
9267,III.,"""Lovelier than ever."""
9268,III.,
9269,III.,"Yet her words went on,"
9270,III.,"Cold and so quiet, ""I have suffered much,"
9271,III.,And I would fain that none who care for me
9272,III.,Should suffer a like pang that I can spare.
9273,III.,"Therefore,"" said she, and not at all could blush,"
9274,III.,"""I have brought my mind of late to think of this:"
9275,III.,"That since your life is spoilt (not willingly,"
9276,III.,"My God, not willingly by me), 'twere well"
9277,III.,To give you choice of griefs.
9278,III.,
9279,III.,"""Were it not best"
9280,III.,"To weep for a dead love, and afterwards"
9281,III.,"Be comforted the sooner, that she died"
9282,III.,"Remote, and left not in your house and life"
9283,III.,Aught to remind you? That indeed were best.
9284,III.,"But were it best to weep for a dead wife,"
9285,III.,And let the sorrow spend and satisfy
9286,III.,"Itself with all expression, and so end?"
9287,III.,"I think not so; but if for you 'tis best,"
9288,III.,"Then,--do not answer with too sudden words:"
9289,III.,"It matters much to you; not much, not much"
9290,III.,"To me,--then truly I will die your wife;"
9291,III.,"I will marry you."""
9292,III.,
9293,III.,"What was he like to say,"
9294,III.,"But, overcome with love and tears, to choose"
9295,III.,"The keener sorrow,--take it to his heart,"
9296,III.,"Cherish it, make it part of him, and watch"
9297,III.,Those eyes that were his light till they should close?
9298,III.,
9299,III.,"He answered her with eager, faltering words,"
9300,III.,"""I choose,--my heart is yours,--die in my arms."""
9301,III.,
9302,III.,"But was it well? Truly, at first, for him"
9303,III.,"It was not well: he saw her fade, and cried,"
9304,III.,"""When may this be?"" She answered, ""When you will,"""
9305,III.,"And cared not much, for very faint she grew,"
9306,III.,"Tired and cold. Oft in her soul she thought,"
9307,III.,"""If I could slip away before the ring"
9308,III.,"Is on my hand, it were a blessed lot"
9309,III.,"For both,--a blessed thing for him, and me."""
9310,III.,
9311,III.,"But it was not so; for the day had come,--"
9312,III.,"Was over: days and months had come, and Death,--"
9313,III.,"Within whose shadow she had lain, which made"
9314,III.,"Earth and its loves, and even its bitterness,"
9315,III.,"Indifferent,--Death withdrew himself, and life"
9316,III.,"Woke up, and found that it was folded fast,"
9317,III.,Drawn to another life forevermore.
9318,III.,"O, what a waking! After it there came"
9319,III.,"Great silence. She got up once more, in spring,"
9320,III.,"And walked, but not alone, among the flowers."
9321,III.,"She thought within herself, ""What have I done?"
9322,III.,"How shall I do the rest?"" And he, who felt"
9323,III.,"Her inmost thought, was silent even as she."
9324,III.,"""What have we done?"" she thought. But as for him,"
9325,III.,"When she began to look him in the face,"
9326,III.,"Considering, ""Thus and thus his features are,"""
9327,III.,"For she had never thought on them before,"
9328,III.,She read their grave repose aright. She knew
9329,III.,"That in the stronghold of his heart, held back,"
9330,III.,Hidden reserves of measureless content
9331,III.,"Kept house with happy thought, for her sake mute."
9332,III.,
9333,III.,"Most patient Muriel! when he brought her home,"
9334,III.,"She took the place they gave her,--strove to please"
9335,III.,"His kin, and did not fail; but yet thought on,"
9336,III.,"""What have I done? how shall I do the rest?"
9337,III.,"Ah! so contented, Laurance, with this wife"
9338,III.,"That loves you not, for all the stateliness"
9339,III.,"And grandeur of your manhood, and the deeps"
9340,III.,"In your blue eyes."" And after that awhile"
9341,III.,"She rested from such thinking, put it by"
9342,III.,And waited. She had thought on death before:
9343,III.,"But no, this Muriel was not yet to die;"
9344,III.,"And when she saw her little tender babe,"
9345,III.,She felt how much the happy days of life
9346,III.,"Outweigh the sorrowful. A tiny thing,"
9347,III.,Whom when it slept the lovely mother nursed
9348,III.,"With reverent love, whom when it woke she fed"
9349,III.,"And wondered at, and lost herself in long"
9350,III.,"Rapture of watching, and contentment deep."
9351,III.,
9352,III.,"Once while she sat, this babe upon her knee,"
9353,III.,"Her husband and his father standing nigh,"
9354,III.,"About to ride, the grandmother, all pride"
9355,III.,"And consequence, so deep in learned talk"
9356,III.,"Of infants, and their little ways and wiles,"
9357,III.,"Broke off to say, ""I never saw a babe"
9358,III.,"So like its father."" And the thought was new"
9359,III.,"To Muriel; she looked up, and when she looked,"
9360,III.,"Her husband smiled. And she, the lovely bloom"
9361,III.,"Flushing her face, would fain he had not known,"
9362,III.,Nor noticed her surprise. But he did know;
9363,III.,"Yet there was pleasure in his smile, and love"
9364,III.,"Tender and strong. He kissed her, kissed his babe,"
9365,III.,"With ""Goody, you are left in charge, take care ""--"
9366,III.,"""As if I needed telling,"" quoth the dame;"
9367,III.,And they were gone.
9368,III.,
9369,III.,"Then Muriel, lost in thought,"
9370,III.,"Gazed; and the grandmother, with open pride,"
9371,III.,"Tended the lovely pair; till Muriel said,"
9372,III.,"""Is she so like? Dear granny, get me now"
9373,III.,"The picture that his father has""; and soon"
9374,III.,The old woman put it in her hand.
9375,III.,
9376,III.,"The wife,"
9377,III.,"Considering it with deep and strange delight,"
9378,III.,"Forgot for once her babe, and looked and learned."
9379,III.,
9380,III.,"A mouth for mastery and manful work,"
9381,III.,"A certain brooding sweetness in the eyes,"
9382,III.,"A brow the harbor of grave thought, and hair"
9383,III.,"Saxon of hue. She conned; then blushed again,"
9384,III.,"Remembering now, when she had looked on him,"
9385,III.,The sudden radiance of her husband's smile.
9386,III.,
9387,III.,But Muriel did not send the picture back;
9388,III.,She kept it; while her beauty and her babe
9389,III.,"Flourished together, and in health and peace"
9390,III.,She lived.
9391,III.,
9392,III.,"Her husband never said to her,"
9393,III.,"""Love, are you happy?"" never said to her,"
9394,III.,"""Sweet, do you love me?"" and at first, whene'er"
9395,III.,"They rode together in the lanes, and paused,"
9396,III.,"Stopping their horses, when the day was hot,"
9397,III.,"In the shadow of a tree, to watch the clouds,"
9398,III.,Ruffled in drifting on the jagged rocks
9399,III.,"That topped the mountains,--when she sat by him,"
9400,III.,Withdrawn at even while the summer stars
9401,III.,"Came starting out of nothing, as new made,"
9402,III.,"She felt a little trouble, and a wish"
9403,III.,"That he would yet keep silence, and he did."
9404,III.,"That one reserve he would not touch, but still"
9405,III.,Respected.
9406,III.,
9407,III.,"Muriel grew more brave in time,"
9408,III.,"And talked at ease, and felt disquietude"
9409,III.,Fade. And another child was given to her.
9410,III.,
9411,III.,"""Now we shall do,"" the old great-grandsire cried,"
9412,III.,"""For this is the right sort, a boy."" ""Fie, fie,"""
9413,III.,"Quoth the good dame; ""but never heed you, love,"
9414,III.,"He thinks them both as right as right can be."""
9415,III.,
9416,III.,"But Laurance went from home, ere yet the boy"
9417,III.,"Was three weeks old. It fretted him to go,"
9418,III.,"But still he said, ""I must"": and she was left"
9419,III.,"Much with the kindly dame, whose gentle care"
9420,III.,Was like a mother's; and the two could talk
9421,III.,"Sweetly, for all the difference in their years."
9422,III.,
9423,III.,"But unaware, the wife betrayed a wish"
9424,III.,That she had known why Laurance left her thus.
9425,III.,"""Ay, love,"" the dame made answer; ""for he said,"
9426,III.,"'Goody,' before he left, 'if Muriel ask"
9427,III.,"No question, tell her naught; but if she let"
9428,III.,"Any disquietude appear to you,"
9429,III.,"Say what you know.'"" ""What?"" Muriel said, and laughed,"
9430,III.,"""I ask, then."""
9431,III.,
9432,III.,"""Child, it is that your old love,"
9433,III.,"Some two months past, was here. Nay, never start:"
9434,III.,"He's gone. He came, our Laurance met him near;"
9435,III.,"He said that he was going over seas,"
9436,III.,"'And might I see your wife this only once,"
9437,III.,"And get her pardon?'"""
9438,III.,
9439,III.,"""Mercy!"" Muriel cried,"
9440,III.,"""But Laurance does not wish it?"""
9441,III.,
9442,III.,"""Nay, now, nay,"""
9443,III.,Quoth the good dame.
9444,III.,"""I cannot,"" Muriel cried;"
9445,III.,"""He does not, surely, think I should."""
9446,III.,
9447,III.,"""Not he,"""
9448,III.,"The kind old woman said, right soothingly."
9449,III.,"""Does not he ever know, love, ever do"
9450,III.,"What you like best?"""
9451,III.,
9452,III.,"And Muriel, trembling yet,"
9453,III.,"Agreed. ""I heard him say,"" the dame went on,"
9454,III.,"""For I was with him when they met that day,"
9455,III.,"'It would not be agreeable to my wife.'"""
9456,III.,
9457,III.,"Then Muriel, pondering,--""And he said no more?"
9458,III.,"You think he did not add, 'nor to myself?'"""
9459,III.,"And with her soft, calm, inward voice, the dame"
9460,III.,"Unruffled answered, ""No, sweet heart, not he:"
9461,III.,"What need he care?"" ""And why not?"" Muriel cried,"
9462,III.,"Longing to hear the answer. ""O, he knows,"
9463,III.,"He knows, love, very well"": with that she smiled."
9464,III.,"""Bless your fair face, you have not really thought"
9465,III.,"He did not know you loved him?"""
9466,III.,
9467,III.,"Muriel said,"
9468,III.,"""He never told me, goody, that he knew."""
9469,III.,"""Well,"" quoth the dame, ""but it may chance, my dear,"
9470,III.,That he thinks best to let old troubles sleep:
9471,III.,"Why need to rouse them? You are happy, sure?"
9472,III.,"But if one asks, 'Art happy?' why, it sets"
9473,III.,"The thoughts a-working. No, say I, let love,"
9474,III.,Let peace and happy folk alone.
9475,III.,
9476,III.,"""He said,"
9477,III.,'It would not be agreeable to my wife.'
9478,III.,"And he went on to add, in course of time"
9479,III.,"That he would ask you, when it suited you,"
9480,III.,"To write a few kind words."""
9481,III.,
9482,III.,"""Yes,"" Muriel said,"
9483,III.,"""I can do that."""
9484,III.,
9485,III.,"""So Laurance went, you see,"""
9486,III.,"The soft voice added, ""to take down that child."
9487,III.,"Laurance had written oft about the child,"
9488,III.,"And now, at last, the father made it known"
9489,III.,"He could not take him. He has lost, they say,"
9490,III.,"His money, with much gambling; now he wants"
9491,III.,"To lead a good, true, working life. He wrote,"
9492,III.,"And let this so be seen, that Laurance went"
9493,III.,"And took the child, and took the money down"
9494,III.,"To pay."""
9495,III.,
9496,III.,"And Muriel found her talking sweet,"
9497,III.,"And asked once more, the rather that she longed"
9498,III.,"To speak again of Laurance, ""And you think"
9499,III.,"He knows I love him?"""
9500,III.,
9501,III.,"""Ay, good sooth, he knows"
9502,III.,"No fear; but he is like his father, love."
9503,III.,His father never asked my pretty child
9504,III.,One prying question; took her as she was;
9505,III.,Trusted her; she has told me so: he knew
9506,III.,A woman's nature. Laurance is the same.
9507,III.,He knows you love him; but he will not speak;
9508,III.,"No, never. Some men are such gentlemen!"""

10349,I.,"By their butter, praising it;"
10350,I.,"And the latest news is told,"
10351,I.,While the fruit and cream are sold;
10352,I.,"And the friendly gossips greet,"
10353,I.,Up and down the sunny street.
10354,I.,"For,"" I said, ""I have not met,"

10357,I.,Looking on a face like thine;
10358,I.,"For thou art as Joseph's cup,"
10359,I.,And by thee might they divine.
10360,I.,
10361,I.,"""Nay! but thou a spirit art;"
10362,I.,Men shall take thee in the mart
10363,I.,"For the ghost of their best thought,"

10367,I.,
10368,I.,"And I put out my rash hand,"
10369,I.,For I thought to draw to land
10370,I.,The white lily. Was it fit
10371,I.,"Such a blossom should expand,"
10372,I.,"Fair enough for a world's wonder,"
10373,I.,And no mortal gather it?
10374,I.,"No. I strove, and it went under,"
10375,I.,"And I drew, but it went down;"
10376,I.,"And the waterweeds' long tresses,"
10377,I.,"And the overlapping cresses,"
10378,I.,Sullied its admired crown.
10379,I.,"Then along the river strand,"
10380,I.,"Trailing, wrecked, it came to land,"
10381,I.,"Of its beauty half despoiled,"
10382,I.,And its snowy pureness soiled:
10383,I.,"O! I took it in my hand,--"
10384,I.,"You will never see it now,"
10385,I.,White and golden as it grew:

10397,I.,And the laying up of light

10399,I.,"Could have passed in kingly mood,"
10400,I.,Would he ever have endued
10401,I.,"Canvas with the peerless thing,"

10403,I.,"And the light that o'er it flowed,"
10404,I.,"With the pureness that it showed,"

10411,II.,
10412,II.,I opened the doors of my heart.
10413,II.,"And behold,"
10414,II.,"There was music within and a song,"
10415,II.,"And echoes did feed on the sweetness, repeating it long."
10416,II.,"I opened the doors of my heart: and behold,"
10417,II.,There was music that played itself out in aeolian notes;
10418,II.,"Then was heard, as a far-away bell at long intervals tolled,"
10419,II.,"That murmurs and floats,"
10420,II.,"And presently dieth, forgotten of forest and wold,"
10421,II.,"And comes in all passion again, and a tremblement soft,"
10422,II.,That maketh the listener full oft
10423,II.,"To whisper, ""Ah! would I might hear it for ever and aye,"
10424,II.,"When I toil in the heat of the day,"
10425,II.,"When I walk in the cold."""
10426,II.,
10427,II.,"I opened the door of my heart. And behold,"
10428,II.,"There was music within, and a song."
10429,II.,"But while I was hearkening, lo, blackness without, thick and strong,"
10430,II.,"Came up and came over, and all that sweet fluting was drowned,"
10431,II.,I could hear it no more;
10432,II.,"For the welkin was moaning, the waters were stirred on the shore,"
10433,II.,And trees in the dark all around
10434,II.,"Were shaken. It thundered. ""Hark, hark! there is thunder to-night!"
10435,II.,"The sullen long wave rears her head, and comes down with a will;"
10436,II.,"The awful white tongues are let loose, and the stars are all dead;--"
10437,II.,There is thunder! it thunders! and ladders of light
10438,II.,"Run up. There is thunder!"" I said,"
10439,II.,"""Loud thunder! it thunders! and up in the dark overhead,"
10440,II.,"A down-pouring cloud, (there is thunder!) a down-pouring cloud"
10441,II.,"Hails out her fierce message, and quivers the deep in its bed,"
10442,II.,"And cowers the earth held at bay; and they mutter aloud,"
10443,II.,"And pause with an ominous tremble, till, great in their rage,"
10444,II.,"The heavens and earth come together, and meet with a crash;"
10445,II.,"And the fight is so fell as if Time had come down with the flash,"
10446,II.,"And the story of life was all read,"
10447,II.,And the Giver had turned the last page.
10448,II.,
10449,II.,"""Now their bar the pent water-floods lash,"

10453,II.,"The long sob of nature's great passion as loath to subside,"

10456,II.,
10457,II.,"Lo! or ever I was 'ware,"

10459,II.,"Through my heart's wide-open door,"
10460,II.,"Music floated forth once more,"
10461,II.,"Floated to the world's dark rim,"
10462,II.,And looked over with a hymn;
10463,II.,"Then came home with flutings fine,"
10464,II.,And discoursed in tones divine
10465,II.,Of a certain grief of mine;
10466,II.,"And went downward and went in,"
10467,II.,"Glimpses of my soul to win,"
10468,II.,And discovered such a deep
10469,II.,"That I could not choose but weep,"
10470,II.,"For it lay, a land-locked sea,"
10471,II.,Fathomless and dim to me.
10472,II.,
10473,II.,"O, the song! it came and went,"
10474,II.,Went and came.
10475,II.,I have not learned
10476,II.,"Half the lore whereto it yearned,"
10477,II.,Half the magic that it meant.
10478,II.,Water booming in a cave;
10479,II.,"Or the swell of some long wave,"
10480,II.,Setting in from unrevealed

10482,II.,"Sweetly talked and deftly sung,"
10483,II.,While the meaning is half sealed;
10484,II.,May be like it. You have heard
10485,II.,Also;--can you find a word
10486,II.,For the naming of such song?
10487,II.,No; a name would do it wrong.
10488,II.,"You have heard it in the night,"
10489,II.,"In the dropping rain's despite,"
10490,II.,"In the midnight darkness deep,"
10491,II.,"When the children were asleep,"

10493,II.,SHE asleep! She knows right well

10495,II.,"While we breathe, can never tell;"
10496,II.,"She hath heard its faultless flow,"
10497,II.,Where the roots of music grow.
10498,II.,
10499,II.,"While I listened, like young birds,"
10500,II.,"Hints were fluttering; almost words,--"
10501,II.,"Leaned and leaned, and nearer came;--"
10502,II.,Everything had changed its name.
10503,II.,
10504,II.,"Sorrow was a ship, I found,"
10505,II.,"Wrecked with them that in her are,"
10506,II.,On an island richer far
10507,II.,Than the port where they were bound.
10508,II.,Fear was but the awful boom
10509,II.,"Of the old great bell of doom,"
10510,II.,"Tolling, far from earthly air,"
10511,II.,For all worlds to go to prayer.
10512,II.,"Pain, that to us mortal clings,"
10513,II.,"But the pushing of our wings,"
10514,II.,"That we have no use for yet,"
10515,II.,And the uprooting of our feet
10516,II.,"From the soil where they are set,"
10517,II.,And the land we reckon sweet.
10518,II.,"Love in growth, the grand deceit"
10519,II.,Whereby men the perfect greet;
10520,II.,"Love in wane, the blessing sent"

10522,II.,Never more with earth content.
10523,II.,"O, full sweet, and O, full high,"
10524,II.,Ran that music up the sky;
10525,II.,"But I cannot sing it you,"
10526,II.,"More than I can make you view,"
10527,II.,"With my paintings labial,"
10528,II.,"Sitting up in awful row,"

10533,II.,"See them now. About their knees,"
10534,II.,"Half in haze, there stands at ease"
10535,II.,"A great army of green hills,"
10536,II.,"Some bareheaded; and, behold,"
10537,II.,Small green mosses creep on some.
10538,II.,Those be mighty forests old;
10539,II.,And white avalanches come
10540,II.,"Through yon rents, where now distils"

10543,II.,Cutting narrow pathways through
10544,II.,"Gentian belts of airy blue,"
10545,II.,"To a zone where starwort blows,"
10546,II.,And long reaches of the rose.
10547,II.,
10548,II.,"So, that haze all left behind,"
10549,II.,"Down the chestnut forests wind,"
10550,II.,"Past yon jagged spires, where yet"
10551,II.,Foot of man was never set;
10552,II.,"Past a castle yawning wide,"
10553,II.,"With a great breach in its side,"
10554,II.,"To a nest-like valley, where,"
10555,II.,"Like a sparrow's egg in hue,"
10556,II.,"Lie two lakes, and teach the true"

10558,II.,
10559,II.,What beside? The world beside!
10560,II.,"Drawing down and down, to greet"
10561,II.,"Cottage clusters at our feet,--"
10562,II.,"Every scent of summer tide,--"
10563,II.,Flowery pastures all aglow
10564,II.,(Men and women mowing go
10565,II.,Up and down them); also soft
10566,II.,"Floating of the film aloft,"
10567,II.,Fluttering of the leaves alow.
10568,II.,Is this told? It is not told.
10569,II.,Where's the danger? where's the cold
10570,II.,Slippery danger up the steep?
10571,II.,Where yon shadow fallen asleep?
10572,II.,"Chirping bird and tumbling spray,"
10573,II.,"Light, work, laughter, scent of hay,"
10574,II.,"Peace, and echo, where are they?"
10575,II.,
10576,II.,"Ah, they sleep, sleep all untold;"
10577,II.,Memory must their grace enfold
10578,II.,Silently; and that high song
10579,II.,"Of the heart, it doth belong"
10580,II.,"To the hearers. Not a whit,"
10581,II.,"Though a chief musician heard,"
10582,II.,Could he make a tune for it.
10583,II.,
10584,II.,"Though a bird of sweetest throat,"

10635,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,The sea

10960,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,To her own island. Gladys poor? Not she!
10961,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Who thinks so? Once I met a man in white,"
10962,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Who said to me, 'The thing that might have been"
10963,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Is called, and questioned why it hath not been;"
10964,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And can it give good reason, it is set"
10965,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Beside the actual, and reckoned in"
10966,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"To fill the empty gaps of life.' Ah, so"
10967,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"The possible stands by us ever fresh,"
10968,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Fairer than aught which any life hath owned,"
10969,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And makes divine amends. Now this was set
10970,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Apart from kin, and not ordained a home;"
10971,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,An equal;--and not suffered to fence in
10972,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"A little plot of earthly good, and say,"
10973,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"'Tis mine'; but in bereavement of the part,"
10974,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"O, yet to taste the whole,--to understand"
10975,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"The grandeur of the story, not to feel"
10976,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Satiate with good possessed, but evermore"
10977,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"A healthful hunger for the great idea,"
10978,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,The beauty and the blessedness of life.
10979,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
10980,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"""Lo, now, the shadow!"" quoth she, breaking off,"
10981,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"""We are in the shadow."" Then did Gladys turn,"
10982,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And, O, the mountain with the purple peaks"
10983,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Was close at hand. It cast a shadow out,"
10984,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And they were in it: and she saw the snow,"
10985,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And under that the rocks, and under that"
10986,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"The pines, and then the pasturage; and saw"
10987,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Numerous dips, and undulations rare,"
10988,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Running down seaward, all astir with lithe"
10989,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Long canes, and lofty feathers; for the palms"
10990,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And spice trees of the south, nay, every growth,"
10991,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Meets in that island.
10992,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
10993,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,So that woman ran
10994,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"The boat ashore, and Gladys set her foot"
10995,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Thereon. Then all at once much laughter rose;
10996,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Invisible folk set up exultant shouts,"
10997,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"""It all belongs to Gladys""; and she ran"
10998,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And hid herself among the nearest trees
10999,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And panted, shedding tears."
11000,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11001,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"So she looked round,"
11002,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And saw that she was in a banyan grove,"
11003,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Full of wild peacocks,--pecking on the grass,"
11004,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"A flickering mass of eyes, blue, green, and gold,"
11005,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Or reaching out their jewelled necks, where high"
11006,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,They sat in rows along the boughs. No tree
11007,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Cumbered with creepers let the sunshine through,"
11008,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"But it was caught in scarlet cups, and poured"
11009,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"From these on amber tufts of bloom, and dropped"
11010,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Lower on azure stars. The air was still,"
11011,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"As if awaiting somewhat, or asleep,"
11012,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And Gladys was the only thing that moved,"
11013,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Excepting,--no, they were not birds,--what then?"
11014,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Glorified rainbows with a living soul?
11015,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"While they passed through a sunbeam they were seen,"
11016,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Not otherwhere, but they were present yet"
11017,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"In shade. They were at work, pomegranate fruit"
11018,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That lay about removing,--purple grapes,"
11019,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That clustered in the path, clearing aside."
11020,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Through a small spot of light would pass and go,"
11021,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,The glorious happy mouth and two fair eyes
11022,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Of somewhat that made rustlings where it went;
11023,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"But when a beam would strike the ground sheer down,"
11024,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Behold them! they had wings, and they would pass"
11025,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"One after other with the sheeny fans,"
11026,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Bearing them slowly, that their hues were seen,"
11027,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Tender as russet crimson dropt on snows,"
11028,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Or where they turned flashing with gold and dashed
11029,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"With purple glooms. And they had feet, but these"
11030,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Did barely touch the ground. And they took heed
11031,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Not to disturb the waiting quietness;
11032,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Nor rouse up fawns, that slept beside their dams;"
11033,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Nor the fair leopard, with her sleek paws laid"
11034,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Across her little drowsy cubs; nor swans,"
11035,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That, floating, slept upon a glassy pool;"
11036,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Nor rosy cranes, all slumbering in the reeds,"
11037,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"With heads beneath their wings. For this, you know,"
11038,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Was Eden. She was passing through the trees
11039,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That made a ring about it, and she caught"
11040,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,A glimpse of glades beyond. All she had seen
11041,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Was nothing to them; but words are not made
11042,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"To tell that tale. No wind was let to blow,"
11043,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And all the doves were bidden to hold their peace.
11044,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Why? One was working in a valley near,"
11045,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And none might look that way. It was understood
11046,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,That He had nearly ended that His work;
11047,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"For two shapes met, and one to other spake,"
11048,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Accosting him with, ""Prince, what worketh He?"""
11049,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Who whispered, ""Lo! He fashioneth red clay."""
11050,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And all at once a little trembling stir
11051,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Was felt in the earth, and every creature woke,"
11052,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And laid its head down, listening. It was known"
11053,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Then that the work was done; the new-made king
11054,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Had risen, and set his feet upon his realm,"
11055,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And it acknowledged him.
11056,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11057,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,But in her path
11058,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Came some one that withstood her, and he said,"
11059,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"""What doest thou here?"" Then she did turn and flee,"
11060,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Among those colored spirits, through the grove,"
11061,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Trembling for haste; it was not well with her
11062,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Till she came forth of those thick banyan-trees,"
11063,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And set her feet upon the common grass,"
11064,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And felt the common wind.
11065,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11066,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Yet once beyond,"
11067,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,She could not choose but cast a backward glance.
11068,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"The lovely matted growth stood like a wall,"
11069,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And means of entering were not evident,--"
11070,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,The gap had closed. But Gladys laughed for joy:
11071,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"She said, ""Remoteness and a multitude"
11072,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Of years are counted nothing here. Behold,"
11073,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"To-day I have been in Eden. O, it blooms"
11074,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"In my own island."""
11075,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11076,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And she wandered on,"
11077,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Thinking, until she reached a place of palms,"
11078,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And all the earth was sandy where she walked,--"
11079,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Sandy and dry,--strewed with papyrus leaves,"
11080,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Old idols, rings and pottery, painted lids"
11081,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Of mummies (for perhaps it was the way
11082,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That leads to dead old Egypt), and withal"
11083,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Excellent sunshine cut out sharp and clear
11084,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"The hot prone pillars, and the carven plinths,--"
11085,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Stone lotus cups, with petals dipped in sand,"
11086,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And wicked gods, and sphinxes bland, who sat"
11087,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And smiled upon the ruin. O how still!
11088,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Hot, blank, illuminated with the clear"
11089,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Stare of an unveiled sky. The dry stiff leaves
11090,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Of palm-trees never rustled, and the soul"
11091,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Of that dead ancientry was itself dead.
11092,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"She was above her ankles in the sand,"
11093,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"When she beheld a rocky road, and, lo!"
11094,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"It bare in it the ruts of chariot wheels,"
11095,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Which erst had carried to their pagan prayers
11096,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,The brown old Pharaohs; for the ruts led on
11097,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"To a great cliff, that either was a cliff"
11098,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Or some dread shrine in ruins,--partly reared"
11099,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"In front of that same cliff, and partly hewn"
11100,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Or excavate within its heart. Great heaps
11101,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Of sand and stones on either side there lay;
11102,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And, as the girl drew on, rose out from each,"
11103,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"As from a ghostly kennel, gods unblest,"
11104,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Dog-headed, and behind them winged things"
11105,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Like angels; and this carven multitude
11106,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Hedged in, to right and left, the rocky road."
11107,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11108,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"At last, the cliff,--and in the cliff a door"
11109,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Yawning: and she looked in, as down the throat"
11110,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Of some stupendous giant, and beheld"
11111,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"No floor, but wide, worn, flights of steps, that led"
11112,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Into a dimness. When the eyes could bear
11113,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That change to gloom, she saw flight after flight,"
11114,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Flight after flight, the worn long stair go down,"
11115,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Smooth with the feet of nations dead and gone.
11116,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,So she did enter; also she went down
11117,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Till it was dark, and yet again went down,"
11118,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Till, gazing upward at that yawning door,"
11119,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"It seemed no larger, in its height remote,"
11120,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Than a pin's head. But while, irresolute,"
11121,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"She doubted of the end, yet farther down"
11122,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,A slender ray of lamplight fell away
11123,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Along the stair, as from a door ajar:"
11124,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"To this again she felt her way, and stepped"
11125,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Adown the hollow stair, and reached the light;"
11126,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"But fear fell on her, fear; and she forbore"
11127,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Entrance, and listened. Ay! 'twas even so,--"
11128,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,A sigh; the breathing as of one who slept
11129,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And was disturbed. So she drew back awhile,"
11130,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And trembled; then her doubting hand she laid
11131,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Against the door, and pushed it; but the light"
11132,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Waned, faded, sank; and as she came within--"
11133,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Hark, hark! A spirit was it, and asleep?"
11134,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,A spirit doth not breathe like clay. There hung
11135,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"A cresset from the roof, and thence appeared"
11136,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"A flickering speck of light, and disappeared;"
11137,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Then dropped along the floor its elfish flakes,"
11138,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That fell on some one resting, in the gloom,--"
11139,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Somewhat, a spectral shadow, then a shape"
11140,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That loomed. It was a heifer, ay, and white,"
11141,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Breathing and languid through prolonged repose.
11142,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11143,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Was it a heifer? all the marble floor
11144,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Was milk-white also, and the cresset paled,"
11145,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And straight their whiteness grew confused and mixed.
11146,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11147,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"But when the cresset, taking heart, bloomed out,--"
11148,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"The whiteness,--and asleep again! but now"
11149,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"It was a woman, robed, and with a face"
11150,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Lovely and dim. And Gladys while she gazed
11151,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Murmured, ""O terrible! I am afraid"
11152,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"To breathe among these intermittent lives,"
11153,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"That fluctuate in mystic solitude,"
11154,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And change and fade. Lo! where the goddess sits
11155,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Dreaming on her dim throne; a crescent moon
11156,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,She wears upon her forehead. Ah! her frown
11157,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Is mournful, and her slumber is not sweet."
11158,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"What dost thou hold, Isis, to thy cold breast?"
11159,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"A baby god with finger on his lips,"
11160,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Asleep, and dreaming of departed sway?"
11161,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Thy son. Hush, hush; he knoweth all the lore"
11162,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And sorcery of old Egypt; but his mouth
11163,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"He shuts; the secret shall be lost with him,"
11164,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"He will not tell."""
11165,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11166,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,The woman coming down!
11167,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"""Child, what art doing here?"" the woman said;"

11169,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"(_Ay, ay, we see thee breathing in thy shroud,--"

11171,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,The air is dim with dust of spiced bones.
11172,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,I mark a crypt down there. Tier upon tier
11173,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Of painted coffers fills it. What if we,"

11175,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Break the frail ancientry, and smothered lie,"
11176,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Tumbled among the ribs of queens and kings,"
11177,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And all the gear they took to bed with them!
11178,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,Horrible! Let us hence.
11179,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,
11180,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"And Gladys said,"
11181,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"""O, they are rough to mount, those stairs""; but she"
11182,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Took her and laughed, and up the mighty flight"
11183,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"Shot like a meteor with her. ""There,"" said she;"

11188,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,"There was a glittering cobweb drawn across,"
11189,AN IMPERFECT FABLE WITH A DOUBTFUL MORAL.,And on the lintel there were writ these words:

12269,_THE APOLOGY._,"Like shipwrights' hammers tapping low,"
12270,_THE APOLOGY._,"Then loud, then low again."
12271,_THE APOLOGY._,
12272,_THE APOLOGY._,"""And a stately house one instant showed,"
12273,_THE APOLOGY._,"Through a rift, on the vessel's lee;"
12274,_THE APOLOGY._,What manner of creatures may be those
12275,_THE APOLOGY._,"That build upon the sea?"""
12276,_THE APOLOGY._,
12277,_THE APOLOGY._,"Then sighed the folk, ""The Lord be praised!"""
12278,_THE APOLOGY._,And they flocked to the shore amain;
12279,_THE APOLOGY._,"All over the Hoe that livelong night,"
12280,_THE APOLOGY._,Many stood out in the rain.
12281,_THE APOLOGY._,
12282,_THE APOLOGY._,"It ceased, and the red sun reared his head,"
12283,_THE APOLOGY._,And the rolling fog did flee;
12284,_THE APOLOGY._,"And, lo! in the offing faint and far"
12285,_THE APOLOGY._,Winstanley's house at sea!
12286,_THE APOLOGY._,
12287,_THE APOLOGY._,In fair weather with mirth and cheer
12288,_THE APOLOGY._,The stately tower uprose;
12289,_THE APOLOGY._,"In foul weather, with hunger and cold,"
12290,_THE APOLOGY._,They were content to close;
12291,_THE APOLOGY._,
12292,_THE APOLOGY._,"Till up the stair Winstanley went,"
12293,_THE APOLOGY._,To fire the wick afar;
12294,_THE APOLOGY._,And Plymouth in the silent night
12295,_THE APOLOGY._,"Looked out, and saw her star."
12296,_THE APOLOGY._,
12297,_THE APOLOGY._,Winstanley set his foot ashore;
12298,_THE APOLOGY._,"Said he, ""My work is done;"
12299,_THE APOLOGY._,I hold it strong to last as long
12300,_THE APOLOGY._,As aught beneath the sun.
12301,_THE APOLOGY._,
12302,_THE APOLOGY._,"""But if it fail, as fail it may,"
12303,_THE APOLOGY._,"Borne down with ruin and rout,"
12304,_THE APOLOGY._,"Another than I shall rear it high,"
12305,_THE APOLOGY._,And brace the girders stout.
12306,_THE APOLOGY._,
12307,_THE APOLOGY._,"""A better than I shall rear it high,"
12308,_THE APOLOGY._,"For now the way is plain,"
12309,_THE APOLOGY._,"And tho' I were dead,"" Winstanley said,"
12310,_THE APOLOGY._,"""The light would shine again."
12311,_THE APOLOGY._,
12312,_THE APOLOGY._,"""Yet, were I fain still to remain,"
12313,_THE APOLOGY._,"Watch in my tower to keep,"
12314,_THE APOLOGY._,And tend my light in the stormiest night
12315,_THE APOLOGY._,That ever did move the deep;
12316,_THE APOLOGY._,
12317,_THE APOLOGY._,"""And if it stood, why then 'twere good,"
12318,_THE APOLOGY._,"Amid their tremulous stirs,"
12319,_THE APOLOGY._,"To count each stroke when the mad waves broke,"
12320,_THE APOLOGY._,For cheers of mariners.
12321,_THE APOLOGY._,
12322,_THE APOLOGY._,"""But if it fell, then this were well,"
12323,_THE APOLOGY._,That I should with it fall;
12324,_THE APOLOGY._,"Since, for my part, I have built my heart"
12325,_THE APOLOGY._,In the courses of its wall.
12326,_THE APOLOGY._,
12327,_THE APOLOGY._,"""Ay! I were fain, long to remain,"
12328,_THE APOLOGY._,"Watch in my tower to keep,"
12329,_THE APOLOGY._,And tend my light in the stormiest night
12330,_THE APOLOGY._,"That ever did move the deep."""
12331,_THE APOLOGY._,
12332,_THE APOLOGY._,"With that Winstanley went his way,"
12333,_THE APOLOGY._,"And left the rock renowned,"
12334,_THE APOLOGY._,And summer and winter his pilot star
12335,_THE APOLOGY._,Hung bright o'er Plymouth Sound.
12336,_THE APOLOGY._,
12337,_THE APOLOGY._,"But it fell out, fell out at last,"
12338,_THE APOLOGY._,"That he would put to sea,"
12339,_THE APOLOGY._,To scan once more his lighthouse tower
12340,_THE APOLOGY._,On the rock o' destiny.
12341,_THE APOLOGY._,
12342,_THE APOLOGY._,"And the winds woke, and the storm broke,"
12343,_THE APOLOGY._,And wrecks came plunging in;
12344,_THE APOLOGY._,None in the town that night lay down
12345,_THE APOLOGY._,Or sleep or rest to win.
12346,_THE APOLOGY._,
12347,_THE APOLOGY._,"The great mad waves were rolling graves,"
12348,_THE APOLOGY._,And each flung up its dead;
12349,_THE APOLOGY._,"The seething flow was white below,"
12350,_THE APOLOGY._,And black the sky o'erhead.
12351,_THE APOLOGY._,
12352,_THE APOLOGY._,"And when the dawn, the dull, gray dawn,--"
12353,_THE APOLOGY._,"Broke on the trembling town,"
12354,_THE APOLOGY._,"And men looked south to the harbor mouth,"
12355,_THE APOLOGY._,The lighthouse tower was down.
12356,_THE APOLOGY._,
12357,_THE APOLOGY._,"Down in the deep where he doth sleep,"
12358,_THE APOLOGY._,"Who made it shine afar,"
12359,_THE APOLOGY._,"And then in the night that drowned its light,"
12360,_THE APOLOGY._,"Set, with his pilot star."
12361,_THE APOLOGY._,
12362,_THE APOLOGY._,_Many fair tombs in the glorious glooms
12363,_THE APOLOGY._,At Westminster they show;
12364,_THE APOLOGY._,The brave and the great lie there in state:
12365,_THE APOLOGY._,Winstanley lieth low._
