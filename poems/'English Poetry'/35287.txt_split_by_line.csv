50,PREFACE.,
51,PREFACE.,
52,PREFACE.,"The Author of the following Poems prefixes a ""Preface"" to them, lest he"
53,PREFACE.,"should seem to be wanting in respect to his readers, did he not comply"
54,PREFACE.,"with a custom which is universal. In doing so, however, he would eschew"
55,PREFACE.,"two kinds of Preface, viz: that in which the author arrogates to himself"
56,PREFACE.,"the merit of having produced a work entirely _new_, both in subject, and"
57,PREFACE.,"in manner of expression, and on that score claims the plaudits of his"
58,PREFACE.,friends and the public;--and that in which the author professes to feel
59,PREFACE.,"himself inadequate to the task of composing a book, but at the pressing"
60,PREFACE.,"solicitation of his friends, with great distrust of his abilities for"
61,PREFACE.,"such a work, he yields to their entreaties, and pleads his inability in"
62,PREFACE.,"mitigation of the critic's wrath. With respect to the former, the writer"
63,PREFACE.,of the present volume professes not to offer to his readers any thing
64,PREFACE.,"_new_, either as to matter, or to language; and as to the latter, the"
65,PREFACE.,"following pieces were most of them composed several years ago, at"
66,PREFACE.,"distant intervals of time, and were frequently perused by his friends"
67,PREFACE.,long before he had thoughts of publishing them:--the character of his
68,PREFACE.,poetry is therefore pretty well known to those who are likely to become
69,PREFACE.,purchasers of his book; and it would be but a bungling apology did he
70,PREFACE.,attempt to shelter its defects under the plea of inability for his task.
71,PREFACE.,
72,PREFACE.,It will be unnecessary to say much of the subjects sung of in the
73,PREFACE.,"following poems. Though they are various, the author hopes they will all"
74,PREFACE.,"be found to contain a moral, which, if acted upon in common life, would"
75,PREFACE.,direct the conduct to a beneficial end. Many of them are founded on
76,PREFACE.,"facts which occurred in the writer's neighbourhood, and which he has"
77,PREFACE.,endeavoured to turn to a useful purpose. Others are of an experimental
78,PREFACE.,"cast, and are the breathings of the poet's heart when inflamed by Love"
79,PREFACE.,Divine! It has been his constant aim to exhibit the workings of grace in
80,PREFACE.,"the heart, its effects on the life, and the glorious futurity to which"
81,PREFACE.,"it conducts its possessor. For this purpose, he has seized on a variety"
82,PREFACE.,"of incidents known to many of his friends, which have furnished him with"
83,PREFACE.,"matter on which to graft a spiritual thought. Life in its spring tide,"
84,PREFACE.,"or when ebbing in death, home with its simple yet hallowed joys, a"
85,PREFACE.,"religious assembly rapt in devotion and love, a landscape endeared by"
86,PREFACE.,"the associations of youth or of kindred, a dilapidated church, a"
87,PREFACE.,"withering flower, a text of scripture--have supplied him with"
88,PREFACE.,topics;--and he trusts that the doctrines which he has inculcated in
89,PREFACE.,connection with them will always be found to agree with the Word of God.
90,PREFACE.,
91,PREFACE.,"Of the ""Dialect"" in which some of the pieces are composed, the author"
92,PREFACE.,deems it necessary to say a few words. It is well known that every
93,PREFACE.,county in England has its peculiarities of expression and pronunciation.
94,PREFACE.,"These peculiarities, though often unintelligible to persons brought up"
95,PREFACE.,"at a distance, are yet the native language of the common inhabitants;"
96,PREFACE.,"and there is, in their estimation, a point and power in them, which are"
97,PREFACE.,not to be found in more polished periods. The author has availed himself
98,PREFACE.,of the dialect of his native county to convey to a particular class of
99,PREFACE.,"persons some important truths, which may, perhaps, be more welcomely"
100,PREFACE.,"received because clad in that garb. There may, indeed, appear to"
101,PREFACE.,"delicate ears, a rudeness approaching to barbarism, in the dialect which"
102,PREFACE.,"he has employed; but what is wanting in polish, will, in the estimation"
103,PREFACE.,"of those for whom he writes, be more than compensated by force and"
104,PREFACE.,vigour. Truth is truth--however humble the habiliments in which it is
105,PREFACE.,dressed: nor does it come with less power to the heart because conveyed
106,PREFACE.,in language with which those for whom it was intended are familiar.
107,PREFACE.,"Indeed, there is in that very _familiarity_ something which arrests the"
108,PREFACE.,"attention and affects the heart. Of the correctness of this view, the"
109,PREFACE.,"author has many times seen proof, in the interest with which some of the"
110,PREFACE.,"pieces in the dialect have been listened to, by persons whose education"
111,PREFACE.,being limited they could not perhaps have appreciated the beauties of
112,PREFACE.,"polished verse, but were at once arrested and delighted when the artless"
113,PREFACE.,tale was narrated in their mother tongue. To make this part of the work
114,PREFACE.,"as complete as possible, great care has been used to render the"
115,PREFACE.,orthography correct: published specimens of the Dialect have been
116,PREFACE.,"consulted, as well as living authorities, and no pains have been spared"
117,PREFACE.,that could contribute to make it complete both to the eye and to the
118,PREFACE.,"ear. A difference of orthography may occasionally appear, caused by the"
119,PREFACE.,necessity of making a rhyme;--excepting a few rare instances of this
120,PREFACE.,"kind, a standard has been adopted which has not been departed from. For"
121,PREFACE.,the assistance of those who are unacquainted with the dialect of the
122,PREFACE.,"North Riding of Yorkshire, a copious glossary is appended to the work,"
123,PREFACE.,by reference to which the meaning of any unknown term or phrase will at
124,PREFACE.,once be seen.
125,PREFACE.,
126,PREFACE.,The author prays that the blessing of God may accompany his work!
