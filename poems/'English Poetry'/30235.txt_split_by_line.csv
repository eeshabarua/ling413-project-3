55,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,This is the first volume of a series of SELECT ENGLISH CLASSICS which
56,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,the publishers have in course of preparation. The series will include an
57,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,extensive variety of selections chosen from the different departments of
58,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"English literature, and arranged and annotated for the use of classes in"
59,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"schools. It will embrace, among other things, representative specimens"
60,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"from all the best English writers, whether of poetry or of prose;"
61,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"selections from English dramatic literature, especially of the"
62,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; choice extracts from the writings
63,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,of the great essayists; selections from famous English allegories; a
64,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,volume of elegies and elegiacal poetry; studies of English prose
65,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"fiction, with illustrative specimens, etc. Each volume will contain"
66,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"copious notes, critical, explanatory, and biographical, besides the"
67,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"necessary vocabularies, glossaries, and indexes; and the series when"
68,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,complete will present a varied and comprehensive view of all that is
69,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"best in English literature. For supplementary reading, as well as for"
70,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"systematic class instruction, the books will possess many peculiarly"
71,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"valuable as well as novel features; while their attractive appearance,"
72,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,"combined with the sterling quality of their contents, will commend them"
73,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,for general reading and make them desirable acquisitions for every
74,PUBLISHERS' NOTE.,library.

82,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"There is but one study more interesting than the history of literature,"
83,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,and that is the study of literature itself. That the former should often
84,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,be mistaken for the latter is scarcely to be wondered at when we
85,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,consider the intimate and almost indivisible relationship existing
86,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"between them. Yet, in truth, they are as capable of separate"
87,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,consideration as are music and the history of music.

89,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: Anglo-Saxon Poetry.]
90,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
91,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: The Transition Period.]
92,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
93,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,Any careful investigation of the history of English poetry would
94,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,naturally begin at a point of time some six or seven hundred years
95,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,earlier than that of Chaucer. From such investigation we should learn
96,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"that even as early as the ninth century--perhaps, indeed, the"
97,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,eighth--there were in England some composers of verse in the Anglo-Saxon
98,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,tongue; that the songs of these poets were chiefly of religion or of
99,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"war, and that being written in a language very different from our modern"
100,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,English they can scarcely be considered as belonging properly to our
101,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"literature; that among them, however, is a noble poem, ""Beowulf,"" the"
102,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"oldest epic of any modern people, which was probably sung or recited by"
103,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"pagan minstrels long before it was written down in permanent form; that,"
104,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"after the conquest of England by the Normans, the early language of the"
105,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"English people underwent a long and tedious process of transition,--a"
106,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"blending, in a certain sense, with the Latinized and more polished"
107,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"tongue of their conquerors,--and that the result was the language which"
108,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,we now call English and are proud to claim as our own; that it was about
109,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"three hundred years after the Norman Conquest, namely, in 1362, that"
110,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,this new tongue was officially recognized and authorized to be used in
111,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,the courts at law throughout the land; and that about the same time
112,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"Geoffrey Chaucer composed and wrote his first poems. We should learn,"
113,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"moreover, that, during the transition period mentioned above, there were"
114,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"many attempts at writing poetry, resulting in the production of tedious"
115,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,metrical romances (chiefly translated from the French) and interminable
116,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"rhyming chronicles, pleasing, of course, to the people of that time, but"
117,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,wholly devoid of poetic excellence and unspeakably dull to modern
118,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"readers; that these poems, so called, were little better than rhymed"
119,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"doggerels, written in couplets of eight-syllabled lines and having for"
120,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,their subjects the miraculous deeds of saints and heroes and the
121,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,occurrence of supernatural or impossible phenomena; that the composers
122,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"of these metrical romances and chronicles, although giving free rein to"
123,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"the imagination, were utterly destitute of poetic fancy and hence"
124,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"produced no true poetry; that, nevertheless, some writer was now and"
125,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"then inspired by a flash of real poetic fire, producing a few lines of"
126,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"remarkable freshness and beauty,--little lyrics shining forth like gems"
127,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,in the great mass of verbiage and rubbish and foretelling the glorious
128,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,possibilities which were to be realized in the future.
129,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
130,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: Piers Ploughman.]
131,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
132,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"Continuing this most interesting study, we should learn that just at the"
133,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"time that Chaucer was beginning the composition of his immortal works,"
134,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"there appeared an allegorical poem of considerable length, so earnest in"
135,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"tone, so richly imaginative, so full of picturesque descriptions, that"
136,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,it seemed rather a fulfilment than a prophecy; that this poem--called
137,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"""The Vision of William concerning Piers Ploughman,"" and written by an"
138,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,obscure monk whose name was probably William Langland--was the greatest
139,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poem and the most popular that had ever been written in England, and yet"
140,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,that it failed in many ways of being true English poetry: its metre was
141,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"irregular, and its rhythm was imperfect; its verses instead of rhyming"
142,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,were constructed in accordance with certain rules of alliteration; its
143,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"subjects, while interesting, no doubt, to those for whom it was written,"
144,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,were not such as bring into play the highest powers of the imagination
145,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,or incite the poetic fancy to its noblest flights. Then we should learn
146,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,that while the ink from good Langland's pen was yet scarcely dry after
147,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"his third revision of ""Piers Ploughman,"" Geoffrey Chaucer came forward"
148,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"with his sweet imaginings bodied in immortal verse, his tuneful numbers,"
149,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"his ""well of English undefiled,""--and English poetry, which now for more"
150,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"than five centuries has been the chief glory of our literature, had its"
151,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,true beginning.
152,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
153,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: Three Schools of Poetry.]
154,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
155,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"Pursuing the study on lines which would now be more distinctly marked,"
156,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"we should observe that Chaucer's best poetry, as well as that of the"
157,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poets who followed him in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, was"
158,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"distinguished by its truthfulness to nature, by its expression in hearty"
159,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"and harmonious words of the finer emotions of the soul, and by the"
160,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,freedom and elasticity of its versification. We should learn that in the
161,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,seventeenth century this style of poetry--sometimes called the
162,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,romantic--was succeeded by another and very different fashion in poetic
163,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"composition, introduced into England in imitation of continental and"
164,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,classical models: that this new style of versification--ignoring nature
165,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"and making everything subservient to art--was purely artificial,"
166,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"characterized by ""an oratorical pomp, a classical correctness, a"
167,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"theatrical dressing, abundance of moralizing""; and that, with Waller for"
168,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"its sponsor and Dryden and Pope for its high priests, it remained for a"
169,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"century and a half the favorite of the literary world, the model of"
170,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poetic diction, the standard of poetic taste. We should learn that,"
171,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"towards the end of the eighteenth century, certain writers began to"
172,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,perceive that although attention to artistic rules in composition may be
173,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"necessary to the best poetry, yet natural feeling, a cultivated"
174,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"imagination, and a fancy unrestrained by merely arbitrary limitations"
175,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"are even more indispensable; that these writers, rebelling against the"
176,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"established order of things, taught that there are elements of true"
177,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poetry in the popular ballads of earlier times, that even the wearisome"
178,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,metrical romances of the Middle Ages are rich in suggestiveness and in
179,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"materials for a nobler poetry, and that, instead of going to the"
180,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"classics and to society for subjects and models, the poet may find them"
181,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"in nature, in the life which is about him, and in a thousand sources"
182,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"never before suspected. Finally, we should learn that, at the very time"
183,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,when great revolutions in politics and philosophy were being
184,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"inaugurated, a new spirit thus began to manifest itself in our"
185,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"literature,--a spirit of revolt against artificial restrictions and"
186,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"traditional methods,--which produced a glorious revival in English"
187,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poetic composition and ushered in a third great school of poetry,"
188,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"distinguished for its breadth and freedom, as that which it superseded"
189,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,had been known for its elegance and precision.[6:1]
190,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
191,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: The History of English Poetry.]
192,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
193,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,A study of the development of English poetry such as we have outlined
194,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,above would involve a knowledge of the history of the English people and
195,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,of the various circumstances and events which from time to time
196,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,influenced our language and literature. It would also embrace many other
197,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"topics, biographical, philological, rhetorical, and speculative, which"
198,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,have only a secondary relationship to the central idea of poetry. In
199,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"fact, it would be a study not of poetry, but about poetry,--of the"
200,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"circumstances which suggested it, of the men who produced it, and of the"
201,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,origin of the word-forms and methods of versification which distinguish
202,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"it. Such a study, altogether interesting and eminently profitable though"
203,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"it be, should not be undertaken by any student until he has acquired an"
204,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,extensive personal acquaintance with poetry itself. We may enjoy the
205,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"beautiful creations of Tennyson, of Shelley, of Burns, even of Chaucer,"
206,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"without knowing one word of the history of poetry, without so much as"
207,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,knowing the names of the writers or the circumstances under which they
208,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"wrote. But, on the other hand, to him who knows nothing of the"
209,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"masterpieces of our literature, save at second hand, the history of"
210,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"English letters must of necessity be dull, uninteresting, and often"
211,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,unintelligible. While to him who has prepared himself for its study by
212,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,fitting himself for an appreciation of these noble creations and
213,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"becoming thoroughly imbued with their spirit, what a field of delightful"
214,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,study does it offer!
215,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
216,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: Object of this Book.]
217,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
218,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: Methods of Study.]
219,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
220,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,The object of the present compilation is to aid in this preparatory
221,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"work,--that is, to offer a plan for promoting the study OF poetry before"
222,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,the broader but less important study ABOUT poetry is undertaken. To this
223,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,end we present for the student's consideration a few representative
224,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,poems written at different times and by men of widely different tastes
225,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,and talents during the six centuries which may be said to have elapsed
226,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,since the formation of the modern English tongue. Our chief aim is to
227,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,lead to such a study of these selections as shall help the reader to
228,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,perceive and appreciate their true poetic qualities and enter into full
229,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,sympathy with the thoughts and feelings which their writers intended to
230,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,express. The first object to be sought in the study of these poems is
231,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,the perception of those characteristic excellences which have made them
232,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,universally admired and placed them among the classics of our language.
233,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"To accomplish this object rationally and successfully, it is best to"
234,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,begin with those productions which are nearest to us in point of time
235,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"and which are more in harmony with our own thoughts, and therefore"
236,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,easiest to understand and enjoy. An attempt to pursue these studies in
237,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"chronological order, beginning with the works of Chaucer and the older"
238,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poets, would oblige the student to encounter at the outset so many"
239,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,purely mechanical difficulties that he would fail to discern the
240,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"spiritual qualities of truth, beauty, and goodness, which are the very"
241,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,essence of all genuine poetry. He would very naturally acquire a
242,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"distaste for poetry long before he was able to understand it, and while"
243,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,he might attain to some considerable knowledge of the history of
244,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poetical literature, that literature itself would remain to him"
245,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"practically a sealed book. Hence, in the study of this subject, as in"
246,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"that of other branches, the true method is to present first that which"
247,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"is the least difficult, to ""proceed from the known to the unknown,"" to"
248,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,begin with that which is near at hand and from it to proceed to the
249,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,consideration of things more remote. Not only are the most of Tennyson's
250,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poems easily understood, but their beauty is readily apparent even to"
251,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,the most superficial readers. By the time we have read and extracted all
252,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"the sweets from three or four of these, we shall be prepared to go a"
253,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,step farther and undertake the study of Wordsworth's immortal
254,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"productions,--productions but little more difficult and but little less"
255,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poetic. Thus, step by step, we may review the six centuries of English"
256,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"poetry which lie behind, and when at last we reach the time of Chaucer"
257,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,we shall be able to take hold of his works with understanding and with
258,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,the zest which is begotten of true sympathy and appreciation. After the
259,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"book has been thus completed, it may be well to run through it again,"
260,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,reversing the order of the lessons and this time considering the
261,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,subjects in strict chronological order. Our first study of the book will
262,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"have introduced us to English poetry, our second study of it will have"
263,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,given us some insight into the history of its development.
264,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
265,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"It is well to remember, while pursuing this course, that a taste for"
266,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,poetry is not acquired or fostered by an analysis of grammatical forms
267,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,or by any study of words merely as such. To analyze a puzzling sentence
268,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,or to trace the derivation of an interesting word to its roots sometimes
269,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,helps one to understand a difficult expression or to perceive in it a
270,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,meaning hitherto unsuspected; but to make the study of any selection
271,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,consist largely of exercises of this kind is to substitute grammar or
272,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"philology for literature. So, also, should it be borne in mind that"
273,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,while it is often interesting and sometimes necessary to become
274,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,acquainted with certain details relative to the life of an author--the
275,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"date of his birth, the character of his education, the influences which"
276,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,shaped his life and his work--yet such knowledge belongs to biography
277,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,and is in no sense literature. The study of authors should never be
278,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"substituted for the study of their works, and is usually profitable only"
279,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,so far as it helps the student to understand the peculiarities which
280,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,distinguish those works and which are the result of certain personal
281,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,characteristics. And yet it is no uncommon thing to find students
282,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,acquainted with the minutest particulars in the lives of the great
283,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"writers, while of the masterpieces of thought and expression, which are"
284,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"the glory of our literature, they betray a deplorable ignorance. Nor is"
285,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"this the case with pupils at school alone. ""For once that we take down a"
286,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"Milton, and read a book of that 'voice,' as Wordsworth says, 'whose"
287,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"sound is like the sea,' we take up fifty times a magazine with something"
288,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"about Milton, or about Milton's grandmother, or a book stuffed with"
289,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"curious facts about the houses in which he lived, and the juvenile"
290,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"ailments of his first wife.""[9:1]"
291,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
292,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,[Sidenote: Practical Suggestions.]
293,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
294,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"In the study of the selections contained in this volume, the following"
295,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,method is recommended:--
296,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
297,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,1. The piece should be thoroughly committed to memory.
298,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
299,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,2. It should be recited or read by each member of the class in such
300,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"manner as to bring out, if possible, his understanding of the meaning of"
301,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,every passage.
302,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
303,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"3. Study the poem as a whole, and let each pupil point out the beauties"
304,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,of thought or expression which distinguish it as a poetical composition.
305,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
306,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"4. Now study each stanza, or each independent thought, in its order, and"
307,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,endeavor to understand each word or expression just as the poet intended
308,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,that it should be understood. The Notes appended to most of the
309,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,selections are intended rather to suggest the line of study in this
310,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"regard than to serve as exhaustive aids. The pupil should, so far as"
311,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"possible, investigate for himself and make his own discoveries."
312,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,Questions concerning the derivation of words and the syntax of sentences
313,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,are to be discussed only so far as they will aid in the understanding of
314,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,some passage or of the piece as a whole.
315,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
316,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,5. Learn some of the most important facts connected with the author's
317,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,life. What were the conditions under which he wrote this piece? What was
318,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,the character of his education and of the other influences which shaped
319,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,his life and distinguished his works? Learn what some of the leading
320,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,critics have said concerning his works as a poet.
321,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
322,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"6. Finally, read the poem again, as a whole, and discuss its qualities"
323,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,"as a work of literary art, and again point out its distinctive beauties"
324,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,and characteristic excellences.
325,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,
326,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,The extracts given at the beginning of each Century will serve to keep
327,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,in mind the leading peculiarities which distinguished the poetry of each
328,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,period; and the lists of poets and their works will be found valuable
329,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,for purposes of reference. Before beginning the study of the selections
330,TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.,both teacher and pupils should read this Introduction carefully.

496,SIX CENTURIES OF ENGLISH POETRY.,to replace studied phrases and a lofty vocabulary by natural tones and

800,NOTES.,"of pictures, its beauty is unsurpassed. The story which is here so"
801,NOTES.,briefly told is founded upon a touching legend connected with the
802,NOTES.,romance of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Tennyson

807,NOTES.,Sir Lancelot was the strongest and bravest of the Knights of the Round

811,NOTES.,"pledged to celibacy, she pined away and died. But before her death she"
812,NOTES.,"called her brother, and having dictated a letter which he was to write,"

814,NOTES.,
815,NOTES.,"""'While my body is whole, let this letter be put into my right hand, and"

820,NOTES.,"one man with me, such as ye trust to steer me thither, and that my barge"

1261,NOTE.,"live upon the earth by bread, and I chose out two of my fellows, and"
1262,NOTE.,sent a third with them as herald. Then straightway they went and mixed

1286,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ALFRED TENNYSON was born at Somersby, Lincolnshire, England, in 1809."
1287,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"His early education was received at home from his father, who was rector"
1288,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,of Somersby and vicar of Bennington and Grimsby. He was afterwards sent
1289,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"to Trinity College, Cambridge, where, at the age of twenty, he received"
1290,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the chancellor's medal for a poem in blank verse, entitled ""Timbuctoo."""
1291,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"In 1830 he published a small volume of ""Poems chiefly Lyrical."" A"
1292,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"revised edition of this volume, published in 1833, contained ""The Lady"
1293,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of Shalott,"" ""The Lotos-Eaters,"" and others of his best-known short"
1294,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poems. In 1850, upon the death of Wordsworth, he was appointed"
1295,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poet-laureate. In the same year he was married to Emily, daughter of"
1296,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Henry Sellwood, Esq., and niece of Sir John Franklin. Since 1851,"
1297,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Tennyson has resided for the greater part of the time at Farringford,"
1298,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Freshwater, Isle of Wight. In December, 1883, he was made Baron Tennyson"
1299,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,of Aldworth and Freshwater.
1300,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
1301,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Mr. Tennyson,"" says R. H. Hutton, ""was an artist even before he was a"
1302,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poet; in other words, the eye for beauty, grace, and harmony of effect"
1303,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was even more emphatically one of his original gifts than the voice for
1304,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poetic utterance itself. This, probably, it is which makes his very"
1305,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"earliest pieces appear so full of effort, and sometimes even so full of"
1306,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"affectation. They were elaborate attempts to embody what he saw, before"
1307,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,the natural voice of the poet had come to him. I think it possible to
1308,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"trace not only a pre-poetic period in his art, but to date the period at"
1309,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"which the soul was 'infused' into his poetry, and the brilliant external"
1310,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,figures became the dwelling-places of germinating poetic thoughts
1311,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"creating their own music. Curiously enough, the first poem where there"
1312,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,is any trace of those musings of the Round Table to which he has
1313,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"directed so much of his maturest genius, is also a confession that the"
1314,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poet was sick of the magic mirror of fancy and its picture-shadows, and"
1315,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was turning away from them to the poetry of human life. Whenever Mr.
1316,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Tennyson's pictorial fancy has had it in any degree in its power to run
1317,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"away with the guiding and controlling mind, the richness and the"
1318,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,workmanship have to some extent overgrown the spiritual principle of his
1319,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poems. It is obvious, for instance, that even in relation to natural"
1320,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"scenery, what his poetical faculty delights in most are rich, luxuriant"
1321,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"landscapes, in which either nature or man has accumulated a lavish"
1322,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"variety of effects. It is in the scenery of the mill, the garden, the"
1323,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"chase, the down, the rich pastures, the harvest-field, the palace"
1324,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"pleasure-grounds, the Lord of Burleigh's fair domains, the luxuriant"
1325,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"sylvan beauty, bearing testimony to the careful hand of man, 'the summer"
1326,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"crisp with shining woods,' that Mr. Tennyson most delights. If he strays"
1327,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"to rarer scenes, it is almost in search of richer and more luxuriant"
1328,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"loveliness, like the tropical splendors of 'Enoch Arden' and the"
1329,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,enervating skies which cheated the Lotos-Eaters of their longing for
1330,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"home."""
1331,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
1332,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Mr. Tennyson,"" says a writer in the _North British Review_, ""deserves"
1333,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"an especial study, not only as a poet, but as a leader and a landmark of"
1334,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"popular thought and feeling. As a poet, he belongs to the highest"
1335,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,category of English writers; for poetry is the strongest and most
1336,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,vigorous branch of English literature. In this literature his works are
1337,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,evidently destined to secure a permanent place; for they express in
1338,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"language refined and artistic, but not unfamiliar, a large segment of"
1339,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the popular thought of the period over which they range. He has,"
1340,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"moreover, a clearly marked if not strongly individualized style, which"
1341,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"has served as a model for imitators, and as a starting-point for poets"

1631,NOTES.,NOTES.
1632,NOTES.,
1633,NOTES.,"""This was composed,"" says Wordsworth, ""during my residence at Town-End,"
1634,NOTES.,Grasmere (1803-1806). Two years at least passed between the writing of
1635,NOTES.,the first four stanzas and the remaining part. To the attentive and
1636,NOTES.,"competent reader the whole sufficiently explains itself, but there may"
1637,NOTES.,be no harm in adverting here to particular feelings or experiences of my
1638,NOTES.,own mind on which the structure of the poem partly rests. Nothing was
1639,NOTES.,more difficult for me in childhood than to admit the notion of death as
1640,NOTES.,a state applicable to my own being. I have said elsewhere:
1641,NOTES.,
1642,NOTES.,'A simple child
1643,NOTES.,"That lightly draws its breath,"
1644,NOTES.,"And feels its life in every limb,"
1645,NOTES.,What should it know of death?'[44:A]
1646,NOTES.,
1647,NOTES.,"""But it was not so much from the source of animal vivacity that _my_"
1648,NOTES.,"difficulty came, as from a sense of the indomitableness of the spirit"
1649,NOTES.,"within me. I used to brood over the stories of Enoch and Elijah, and"
1650,NOTES.,"almost persuade myself that, whatever might become of others, I should"
1651,NOTES.,be translated in something of the same way to heaven. With a feeling
1652,NOTES.,"congenial to this, I was often unable to think of external things as"
1653,NOTES.,"having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as"
1654,NOTES.,"something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature."
1655,NOTES.,Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to
1656,NOTES.,recall myself from this abyss of idealism to reality. At that time I was
1657,NOTES.,"afraid of mere processes. In later periods of life I have deplored, as"
1658,NOTES.,"we have all reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character, and"
1659,NOTES.,"have rejoiced over the remembrances, as is expressed in the lines,"
1660,NOTES.,"_Obstinate questionings_, etc. To that dream-like vividness and splendor"
1661,NOTES.,"which invests objects of sight in childhood every one, I believe, if he"
1662,NOTES.,"could look back, could bear testimony, and I need not dwell upon it"
1663,NOTES.,here; but having in the poem regarded it as a presumptive evidence of a
1664,NOTES.,"prior state of existence, I think it right to protest against a"
1665,NOTES.,"conclusion which has given pain to some good and pious persons, that I"
1666,NOTES.,meant to inculcate such a belief. It is far too shadowy a notion to be
1667,NOTES.,recommended to faith as more than an element in our instincts of
1668,NOTES.,"immortality. But let us bear in mind that, though the idea is not"
1669,NOTES.,"advanced in Revelation, there is nothing there to contradict it, and the"
1670,NOTES.,"fall of man presents an analogy in its favor. Accordingly, a"
1671,NOTES.,"pre-existent state has entered into the popular creeds of many nations,"
1672,NOTES.,and among all persons acquainted with classic literature is known as an
1673,NOTES.,ingredient in Platonic philosophy. Archimedes said that he could move
1674,NOTES.,the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine. Who has not
1675,NOTES.,felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his mind? Having to
1676,NOTES.,wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the
1677,NOTES.,"'Immortality of the Soul,' I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as"
1678,NOTES.,having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorizing me to make for
1679,NOTES.,"my purpose the best use of it I could as a poet."""

2014,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"WILLIAM WORDSWORTH was born at Cockermouth, a town in Cumberland,"
2015,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"England, April 7, 1770. He went to school at Hawkshead, Lancashire,"
2016,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"whence in his seventeenth year he was sent to St. John's College,"
2017,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Cambridge. In January, 1791, he took his degree at the University, but"
2018,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,without having distinguished himself in any way. The next fifteen or
2019,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"sixteen months were spent in France, just then in the first wild hopes"
2020,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of the Revolution. ""In the aspirations and hopes of the revolutionists"
2021,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,he was an ardent sharer; he thought that the world's great age was
2022,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,beginning anew; and with all his soul he hailed so splendid an era. The
2023,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ultimate degradation of that great movement by wild lawlessness, and"
2024,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"then by most selfish ambition, alienated his sympathy for it."" Towards"
2025,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the close of 1792 he returned to England, and passed the subsequent time"
2026,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,among his friends in London and elsewhere till he settled with his
2027,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"sister at Racedown, Dorsetshire, in 1796. In the following year they"
2028,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,removed to Alfoxden. It was during this period that he made the
2029,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,acquaintance of Coleridge. Wordsworth had already published (1793) two
2030,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"little volumes of poetry, entitled _Descriptive Sketches_ and _The"
2031,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Evening Walk_; but they showed little promise of the triumphs which were
2032,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,to crown his later life. In 1798 the first volume of the _Lyrical
2033,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Ballads_ was published at Bristol, which purported to be the joint work"
2034,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of himself and Mr. Coleridge, but to which the latter contributed only"
2035,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""The Ancient Mariner"" and two or three shorter poems. After some months"
2036,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"spent in Germany, Wordsworth and his sister established themselves at"
2037,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Grasmere, in the lake country. In 1800 he published the second volume of"
2038,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the _Lyrical Ballads_, and in 1802 he married Mary Hutchinson. From 1799"
2039,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"to 1814 he was mainly busy with his great philosophical poem, to be"
2040,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"called ""The Recluse,"" ""containing views of Man, Nature, and Society,"" of"
2041,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"which ""The Prelude"" was to be the introduction and ""The Excursion"" the"
2042,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Second and main Part. He designed that his minor pieces should be so
2043,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"arranged in connection with this work as to ""give them claim to be"
2044,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"likened to the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses,"
2045,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ordinarily included in Gothic churches."" This plan, however, was never"
2046,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"carried out, as of the First and Third Parts only one book was written,"
2047,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,and it has never been published. From 1814 until his death Wordsworth
2048,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"lived serenely and quietly at Rydal Mount, making occasional excursions"
2049,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"into Scotland and Wales, and a tour upon the continent. In 1843, upon"
2050,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the death of Southey, he was appointed Poet-Laureate. His life was a"
2051,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"long one, of steady work and much happiness. He died April 23, 1850."
2052,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
2053,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,The distinguishing feature of Wordsworth's poetry is well set forth in
2054,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,his own words:
2055,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
2056,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""The moving accident is not my trade,"
2057,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,To freeze the blood I have no ready arts;
2058,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade,"
2059,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts."""
2060,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"--_Hart-Leap Well, Part II._"
2061,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
2062,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Every great poet,"" he said, ""is a teacher; I wish either to be"
2063,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"considered as a teacher or as nothing."""
2064,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
2065,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"And he avowed that the purpose of his poetry was ""to console the"
2066,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,afflicted; to add sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier; to
2067,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"teach the young and the gracious of every age _to see, to think and"
2068,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"feel_, and therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous."""
2069,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
2070,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Love had he found in huts where poor men lie,"
2071,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"His daily teachings had been woods and rills,"
2072,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"The silence that is in the starry sky,"
2073,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"The sleep that is among the lonely hills."""
2074,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
2075,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Wordsworth,"" says John Campbell Shairp, ""was the first who, both in"
2076,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"theory and practice, shook off the trammels of the so-called poetic"
2077,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,diction which had tyrannized over English poetry for more than a
2078,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"century. This diction of course exactly represented the half-courtly,"
2079,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,half-classical mode of thinking and feeling. As Wordsworth rebelled
2080,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"against this conventionality of spirit, so against the outward"
2081,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,expression of it. The whole of the stock phrases and used-up metaphors
2082,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"he discarded, and returned to living language of natural feeling, as it"
2083,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"is used by men, instead of the dead form of it which had got stereotyped"
2084,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,in books. And just as in his subjects he had taken in from the waste
2085,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"much virgin soil, so in his diction he appropriated for poetic use a"
2086,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"large amount of words, idioms, metaphors, till then by the poets"
2087,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"disallowed. His shorter poems, both the earlier and the later, are, for"
2088,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the most part, very models of natural, powerful, and yet sensitive"
2089,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"English; the language being, like a garment, woven out of, and"
2090,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"transparent with, the thought."""

2155,PART I.,"She stole along, she nothing spoke,"

2181,PART I.,"Jesu, Maria, shield her well!"
2182,PART I.,"She folded her arms beneath her cloak,"

2184,PART I.,What sees she there?
2185,PART I.,
2186,PART I.,"There she sees a damsel bright,"
2187,PART I.,"Drest in a silken robe of white,"
2188,PART I.,That shadowy in the moonlight shone:

2190,PART I.,Her stately neck and arms were bare;
2191,PART I.,"Her blue-vein'd feet unsandal'd were,"

2199,PART I.,"(Said Christabel,) ""And who art thou?"""
2200,PART I.,
2201,PART I.,"The lady strange made answer meet,"
2202,PART I.,And her voice was faint and sweet:--
2203,PART I.,"""Have pity on my sore distress,"
2204,PART I.,I scarce can speak for weariness:
2205,PART I.,"Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!"""
2206,PART I.,"Said Christabel, ""How camest thou here?"""
2207,PART I.,"And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,"
2208,PART I.,Did thus pursue her answer meet:--
2209,PART I.,"""My sire is of a noble line,"
2210,PART I.,And my name is Geraldine:
2211,PART I.,"Five warriors seized me yestermorn,"
2212,PART I.,"Me, even me, a maid forlorn:"
2213,PART I.,"They choked my cries with force and fright,"
2214,PART I.,And tied me on a palfrey white.
2215,PART I.,"The palfrey was as fleet as wind,"
2216,PART I.,And they rode furiously behind.
2217,PART I.,"They spurred amain, their steeds were white:"
2218,PART I.,And once we cross'd the shade of night.
2219,PART I.,"As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,"
2220,PART I.,I have no thought what men they be;
2221,PART I.,Nor do I know how long it is
2222,PART I.,(For I have lain entranced I wis)
2223,PART I.,"Since one, the tallest of the five,"
2224,PART I.,"Took me from the palfrey's back,"
2225,PART I.,"A weary woman, scarce alive."
2226,PART I.,Some mutter'd words his comrades spoke:
2227,PART I.,He placed me underneath this oak;
2228,PART I.,He swore they would return with haste;
2229,PART I.,Whither they went I cannot tell--
2230,PART I.,"I thought I heard, some minutes past,"
2231,PART I.,Sounds as of a castle bell.
2232,PART I.,"Stretch forth thy hand"" (thus ended she),"
2233,PART I.,"""And help a wretched maid to flee."""
2234,PART I.,
2235,PART I.,Then Christabel stretch'd forth her hand
2236,PART I.,And comforted fair Geraldine;
2237,PART I.,"""O well, bright dame! may you command"
2238,PART I.,The service of Sir Leoline;
2239,PART I.,And gladly our stout chivalry
2240,PART I.,Will he send forth and friends withal
2241,PART I.,To guide and guard you safe and free
2242,PART I.,"Home to your noble father's hall."""
2243,PART I.,
2244,PART I.,She rose: and forth with steps they pass'd
2245,PART I.,"That strove to be, and were not, fast."
2246,PART I.,"Her gracious stars the lady blest,"
2247,PART I.,And thus spake on sweet Christabel:
2248,PART I.,"""All our household are at rest,"
2249,PART I.,The hall is silent as the cell;
2250,PART I.,"Sir Leoline is weak in health,"
2251,PART I.,"And may not well awaken'd be,"
2252,PART I.,"But we will move as if in stealth,"
2253,PART I.,"And I beseech your courtesy,"
2254,PART I.,"This night, to share your couch with me."""
2255,PART I.,
2256,PART I.,"They cross'd the moat, and Christabel"
2257,PART I.,Took the key that fitted well;
2258,PART I.,"A little door she open'd straight,"
2259,PART I.,All in the middle of the gate;
2260,PART I.,"The gate that was iron'd within and without,"
2261,PART I.,Where an army in battle array had march'd out.
2262,PART I.,"The lady sank, belike through pain,"
2263,PART I.,And Christabel with might and main
2264,PART I.,"Lifted her up, a weary weight,"
2265,PART I.,Over the threshold of the gate:
2266,PART I.,"Then the lady rose again,"
2267,PART I.,"And moved, as she were not in pain."
2268,PART I.,
2269,PART I.,"So free from danger, free from fear,"
2270,PART I.,They cross'd the court: right glad they were.
2271,PART I.,And Christabel devoutly cried
2272,PART I.,To the lady by her side;
2273,PART I.,"""Praise we the Virgin all divine"
2274,PART I.,"Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!"""
2275,PART I.,"""Alas, alas!"" said Geraldine,"
2276,PART I.,"""I cannot speak for weariness."""
2277,PART I.,"So free from danger, free from fear,"
2278,PART I.,They cross'd the court: right glad they were.
2279,PART I.,
2280,PART I.,Outside her kennel the mastiff old
2281,PART I.,"Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold."
2282,PART I.,"The mastiff old did not awake,"
2283,PART I.,Yet she an angry moan did make!
2284,PART I.,And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
2285,PART I.,Never till now she utter'd yell
2286,PART I.,Beneath the eye of Christabel.
2287,PART I.,Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:
2288,PART I.,For what can ail the mastiff bitch?
2289,PART I.,
2290,PART I.,"They pass'd the hall, that echoes still,"
2291,PART I.,Pass as lightly as you will!
2292,PART I.,"The brands were flat, the brands were dying,"
2293,PART I.,Amid their own white ashes lying;
2294,PART I.,"But when the lady pass'd, there came"
2295,PART I.,"A tongue of light, a fit of flame;"
2296,PART I.,"And Christabel saw the lady's eye,"
2297,PART I.,"And nothing else saw she thereby,"
2298,PART I.,"Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,"
2299,PART I.,Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.
2300,PART I.,"""O softly tread,"" said Christabel,"
2301,PART I.,"""My father seldom sleepeth well."""
2302,PART I.,
2303,PART I.,"Sweet Christabel her feet both bare,"
2304,PART I.,"And, jealous of the listening air,"
2305,PART I.,"They steal their way from stair to stair,"
2306,PART I.,"Now in glimmer, and now in gloom,"
2307,PART I.,"And now they pass the Baron's room,"
2308,PART I.,"And still as death, with stifled breath!"
2309,PART I.,And now have reach'd her chamber door;

2319,PART I.,For a lady's chamber meet:
2320,PART I.,The lamp with twofold silver chain

2322,PART I.,
2323,PART I.,The silver lamp burns dead and dim;
2324,PART I.,But Christabel the lamp will trim.
2325,PART I.,"She trimm'd the lamp, and made it bright,"
2326,PART I.,"And left it swinging to and fro,"
2327,PART I.,"While Geraldine, in wretched plight,"
2328,PART I.,Sank down upon the floor below.
2329,PART I.,
2330,PART I.,"""O weary lady, Geraldine,"
2331,PART I.,"I pray you, drink this cordial wine!"
2332,PART I.,It is a wine of virtuous powers;

2335,PART I.,"""And will your mother pity me,"

2338,PART I.,She died the hour that I was born.
2339,PART I.,"I have heard the gray-hair'd friar tell,"
2340,PART I.,"How on her death-bed she did say,"

2345,PART I.,
2346,PART I.,"But soon with altered voice, said she--"
2347,PART I.,"""Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!"
2348,PART I.,"I have power to bid thee flee."""
2349,PART I.,Alas! what ails poor Geraldine?
2350,PART I.,Why stares she with unsettled eye?
2351,PART I.,Can she the bodiless dead espy?
2352,PART I.,"And why with hollow voice cries she,"

2354,PART I.,"Though thou her guardian spirit be,"
2355,PART I.,"Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me."""

2357,PART I.,"Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,"
2358,PART I.,And raised to heaven her eyes so blue--
2359,PART I.,"""Alas!"" said she, ""this ghastly ride--"
2360,PART I.,"Dear lady! it hath wilder'd you!"""
2361,PART I.,"The lady wiped her moist cold brow,"

2363,PART I.,
2364,PART I.,Again the wild-flower wine she drank:
2365,PART I.,"Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,"
2366,PART I.,"And from the floor whereon she sank,"
2367,PART I.,The lofty lady stood upright:
2368,PART I.,"She was most beautiful to see,"
2369,PART I.,Like a lady of a far countrée.
2370,PART I.,
2371,PART I.,And thus the lofty lady spake--
2372,PART I.,"""All they who live in the upper sky,"
2373,PART I.,"Do love you, holy Christabel!"
2374,PART I.,"And you love them, and for their sake"
2375,PART I.,"And for the good which me befell,"
2376,PART I.,"Even I in my degree will try,"
2377,PART I.,"Fair maiden, to requite you well."
2378,PART I.,But now unrobe yourself; for I
2379,PART I.,"Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie."""
2380,PART I.,
2381,PART I.,"Quoth Christabel, ""So let it be!"""

2383,PART I.,"Her gentle limbs did she undress,"
2384,PART I.,And lay down in her loveliness.
2385,PART I.,
2386,PART I.,But through her brain of weal and woe
2387,PART I.,"So many thoughts move to and fro,"
2388,PART I.,That vain it were her lids to close;
2389,PART I.,"So half-way from the bed she rose,"
2390,PART I.,And on her elbow did recline
2391,PART I.,To look at the lady Geraldine.
2392,PART I.,
2393,PART I.,"Beneath the lamp the lady bow'd,"
2394,PART I.,And slowly roll'd her eyes around;
2395,PART I.,Then drawing in her breath aloud
2396,PART I.,"Like one that shudder'd, she unbound"
2397,PART I.,The cincture from beneath her breast;
2398,PART I.,"Her silken robe and inner vest,"
2399,PART I.,"Dropt to her feet, and full in view,"
2400,PART I.,Behold! her bosom and half her side--
2401,PART I.,"A sight to dream of, not to tell!"
2402,PART I.,O shield her! shield sweet Christabel.
2403,PART I.,
2404,PART I.,Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;
2405,PART I.,Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
2406,PART I.,Deep from within seems half-way
2407,PART I.,"To lift some weight with sick assay,"
2408,PART I.,And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
2409,PART I.,Then suddenly as one defied
2410,PART I.,"Collects herself in scorn and pride,"
2411,PART I.,And lay down by the maiden's side!--
2412,PART I.,"And in her arms the maid she took,"
2413,PART I.,"Ah, well-a-day!"
2414,PART I.,And with low voice and doleful look
2415,PART I.,These words did say:

2465,NOTES,"seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents never exceed four. The"

3105,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY was born at Field Place, near Horsham in Sussex,"
3106,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"August 4, 1792. He was educated at Eton and at Oxford. While a student"
3107,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"at the latter place, he wrote a pamphlet, entitled _The Necessity of"
3108,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Atheism_, which caused his expulsion from college. This occurred in"
3109,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"1811, and in the same year he married Harriet Westbrook, from whom,"
3110,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"three years later, he separated. In 1816 he married Mary Godwin. In 1818"
3111,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"he left England for Italy, where he remained until his death by drowning"
3112,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in the gulf of Spezia, July 8, 1822. His first considerable poem, ""Queen"
3113,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Mab,"" was published in 1813; ""Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude,"" in"
3114,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"1816; ""The Revolt of Islam,"" in 1818; and ""Epipsychidion"" and ""Adonais"""
3115,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in 1821. His two dramas, the ""Cenci"" and ""Prometheus Unbound,"" were"
3116,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"issued, the former in 1819, the latter in 1821."
3117,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
3118,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Shelley's early rupture with the English world,"" says Hales, ""lost him"
3119,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,all the advantages which a fuller experience of it and a longer
3120,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,intercourse with it might have given. That world was no less estranged
3121,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,from him than he from it. It misunderstood and misinterpreted him
3122,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"throughout his career. It covered him with its opprobrium. Assuredly, he"
3123,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was not the man that world painted. It by no means follows that because
3124,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Shelley did not repeat the ordinary creeds, and even mocked at them,"
3125,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,that he believed nothing. Shelley was never in his soul an atheist: it
3126,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was simply impossible with his nature that he should be; what he did
3127,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"deny and defy was a deity whose worship seemed, as he saw the world,"
3128,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"consistent with the reign of selfishness and bigotry."""
3129,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
3130,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Lord Macaulay says: ""We doubt whether any modern poet has possessed in"
3131,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,an equal degree some of the highest qualities of the great ancient
3132,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"masters. The words _bard_ and _inspiration_, which seem so cold and"
3133,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"affected when applied to other modern writers, have a perfect propriety"
3134,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"when applied to him. He was not an author, but a bard. His poetry seems"
3135,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"not to have been an art, but an inspiration. Had he lived to the full"
3136,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"age of man, he might not improbably, have given to the world some great"
3137,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"work of the very highest rank in design and execution."""
3138,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
3139,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Leigh Hunt says: ""Assuredly, had he lived, he would have been the"

3141,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Coleridge is the sweetest of our poets, Shelley is at once the most"
3142,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,ethereal and most gorgeous--the one who has clothed his thoughts in
3143,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,draperies of the most evanescent and most magnificent words and imagery.
3144,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"His poetry is as full of mountains, seas, and skies, of light, and"
3145,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"darkness, and the seasons, and all the elements of our being, as if"
3146,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Nature herself had written it, with the Creation and its hopes newly"
3147,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"cast around her, not, it must be confessed, without too indiscriminate a"

3149,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"chaotic brilliancy, 'dark with excess of light.'"""
3150,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
3151,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Another English poet says: ""Shelley outsang all poets on record but some"
3152,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,two or three throughout all time; his depths and heights of inner and
3153,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"outer music are as divine as nature's, and not sooner exhaustible. He"

3160,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the tender melancholy of the moonlight he loved, that the world is still"
3161,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"half blind to his highest bardic character, as the poet of a spiritual"
3162,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"dawn, the eager spirit who flies forward--"

3613,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"JOHN KEATS was born October 29, 1795, in Moorfields, London. He was sent"
3614,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"to school at Enfield, where he gained the rudiments of a classical"
3615,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"education; but, his father having died when John was a mere child, he"
3616,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was apprenticed at an early age to a surgeon in Edmonton. When seventeen
3617,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"years old a copy of Spenser's ""Faerie Queene"" fell into his hands, and"
3618,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the perusal of that great poem was the beginning, for him, of a new"
3619,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"life. He felt the poetic instinct within him, and resolved that he too"
3620,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"would be a poet. In 1817 he published a small volume of poems, which"
3621,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"attracted but little attention; and in 1818 his more ambitious effort,"
3622,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Endymion,"" was presented to the world. The latter poem was unkindly"
3623,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"received by the great reviews. The author was advised to ""go back to his"
3624,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"gallipots,"" and told that ""a starved apothecary was better than a"
3625,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"starved poet."" A story was long current that these severe criticisms"
3626,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"induced Keats's early death, but this is entirely improbable. He"
3627,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"continued writing, although consumption, a hereditary disease in his"
3628,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"family, had already begun its work upon him. He published ""The Eve of"
3629,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"St. Agnes"" in 1820, and had made some progress with a noble poem,"
3630,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"entitled ""Hyperion,"" which Lord Byron declared to be ""actually inspired"
3631,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"by the Titans, and as sublime as Æschylus."" In September of that year he"
3632,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"sailed for Italy, but the hope of prolonging life by a change of climate"
3633,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"proved to be vain. On the 27th of February, 1821, he died at Rome."

3664,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"correct form, for which Pope sought, but beautiful form was sought"
3665,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,after. Men like Thomas Gray and William Collins strove to pour into

3671,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,thoughts of man. The way was therefore now made ready for a style in
3672,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"which the Art should itself be Nature, and it sprang at once into being"
3673,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,in the work of the poets of this time. The style of Gray is polished to
3674,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the finest point, and yet it is instinct with natural feeling. Goldsmith"

3977,NOTES.,
3978,NOTES.,"This poem, composed in 1785, is written partly in the Scottish dialect,"
3979,NOTES.,partly in English. The livelier passages are in the poet's vernacular;
3980,NOTES.,the loftier or more solemn parts in the language of books. This
3981,NOTES.,distinction was doubtless made because Burns disliked to treat his
3982,NOTES.,"higher themes in a merely colloquial manner, fearing to belittle them by"
3983,NOTES.,so doing. The household described was probably that of the poet's own
3984,NOTES.,"father; it was at least a typical Scotch peasant's household, with which"
3985,NOTES.,"no one was more familiar. Gilbert Burns, in a letter to Dr. Currie,"
3986,NOTES.,"says: ""Although the 'Cotter' in the Saturday Night, is an exact copy of"
3987,NOTES.,"my father in his manners, his family devotions, and exhortations, yet"
3988,NOTES.,the other parts of the description do not apply to our family. None of
3989,NOTES.,us ever went 'At service out amang the neibors roun'.' Instead of our
3990,NOTES.,"depositing our 'sair-won penny-fee' with our parents, my father labored"
3991,NOTES.,"hard, and lived with the most rigid economy, that he might be able to"
3992,NOTES.,"keep his children at home."""

3995,NOTES.,passage in this poem.

3998,NOTES.,"was something particularly venerable in the phrase, 'Let us worship"
3999,NOTES.,"God,' used by a decent, sober head of a family introducing family"
4000,NOTES.,"worship. To this sentiment of the author, the world is indebted for 'The"

4340,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ROBERT BURNS was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1759. His childhood and"
4341,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"youth were spent in poverty on his father's farm, where he learned to"
4342,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"plough, reap, mow, and thresh in the barn, but where opportunities for"
4343,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,education were such only as Scottish peasants know. In 1784 his father
4344,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"died, and he attempted to manage a farm of his own at Mossgiel. The"
4345,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"experiment proving to be a failure, he resolved to leave Scotland, and"
4346,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,secured an appointment to a clerkship in Jamaica. Just before the time
4347,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"set for his departure, he learned of the success of a volume of his"
4348,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poems which had just been published at Kilmarnock; and, instead of"
4349,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"departing for the West Indies, he made a visit to Edinburgh. He was"
4350,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"welcomed by the best society, and received at once into the literary"
4351,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"circles of the Scottish capital. ""His name and fame flashed like"
4352,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"sunshine over the land: the shepherd on the hill, the maiden at her"
4353,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"wheel, learned his songs by heart, and the first scholars of Scotland"
4354,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"courted his acquaintance."" A second edition of his poems was published"
4355,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in 1787, and with the proceeds--about $2500--he took a farm at"
4356,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Ellisland, in Nithsdale. But his habits were such that he made sad"
4357,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"failure a second time in the experiment of farming; and, after two years"
4358,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of mismanagement, to eke out his scanty income he accepted an"

4760,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
4761,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"WILLIAM COWPER was born at Great Berkhamstead, November 26, 1731. His"
4762,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"father was the rector of the parish, and his mother was Ann Donne of the"
4763,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,family of the famous John Donne. Cowper was educated at a private school
4764,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,and afterwards at Westminster. It was intended that he should follow the
4765,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"profession of law, and, after the completion of his studies at"
4766,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Westminster, he entered the Middle Temple and was articled to a"
4767,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"solicitor. At the age of twenty-two, through the influence of his uncle,"
4768,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Major Cowper, he was appointed to two clerkships in the House of Lords."
4769,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"The excitement brought on by this occurrence, together with an unhappy"
4770,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"love affair, induced an attack of insanity, from which he suffered for"
4771,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"more than a year. In 1773 he suffered from a second attack of insanity,"
4772,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"which continued for sixteen months. It was not until 1780, when in his"
4773,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"fiftieth year, that he began really to write poetry. His first volume"
4774,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"was published in 1782, and comprised, besides several shorter pieces,"
4775,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the three poems, ""Conversation,"" ""Retirement,"" and ""Table Talk."" His"
4776,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"second volume appeared in 1785, and contained ""The Task,"" ""Tirocinium,"""
4777,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"and the ballad of ""John Gilpin,"" which had already become famous through"
4778,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the recitations of one Henderson, an actor. Cowper's translation of"
4779,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Homer was completed and published in 1791. From that time until his
4780,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"death in 1800 he suffered from hopeless dejection, regarding himself as"
4781,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"an object of divine wrath, a condemned and forsaken outcast."
4782,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
4783,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Cowper was not a great poet; but he was the first to abandon the
4784,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,mechanical versification and conventional phrases of the artificial
4785,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poets, to find inspiration and guidance in nature. It may be said that"
4786,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"he lacked creative power; but he possessed a quickness of thought, a"
4787,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"depth of feeling, and a certain manliness and sincerity, which lifted"
4788,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,him above the level of the ordinary versifiers of his time.

5223,NOTES.,
5224,NOTES.,"This poem was published in 1757. ""It is founded,"" says Gray, ""on a"
5225,NOTES.,"tradition current in Wales that Edward I., when he completed the"
5226,NOTES.,"conquest of that country, ordered all the bards that fell into his hands"
5227,NOTES.,"to be put to death."" The argument is as follows: ""The army of Edward I.,"
5228,NOTES.,"as they march through a deep valley, and approach Mount Snowdon, are"
5229,NOTES.,suddenly stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure seated on the
5230,NOTES.,"summit of an inaccessible rock, who, with a voice more than human,"
5231,NOTES.,reproaches the king with all the desolation and misery which he had
5232,NOTES.,"brought on his country; foretells the misfortunes of the Norman race,"
5233,NOTES.,and with prophetic spirit declares that all his cruelty shall never
5234,NOTES.,extinguish the noble ardor of poetic genius in this island; and that men
5235,NOTES.,shall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valor in immortal
5236,NOTES.,"strains, to expose vice and infamous pleasure, and boldly censure"
5237,NOTES.,"tyranny and oppression. His song ended, he precipitates himself from the"
5238,NOTES.,"mountain, and is swallowed up by the river that rolls at its feet."""
5239,NOTES.,
5240,NOTES.,"The tradition upon which the poem is said to be founded, if it ever had"
5241,NOTES.,"any existence, is in great part mythical. Edward I. did indeed conquer"
5242,NOTES.,"Wales, but there is no evidence that he massacred or even persecuted the"
5243,NOTES.,Welsh bards. A hundred years after his time their number and influence
5244,NOTES.,had not been diminished.
5245,NOTES.,
5246,NOTES.,This poem is a good example of an English ode constructed strictly after
5247,NOTES.,"Greek models. It will be observed that it is written, not in uniform"
5248,NOTES.,"stanzas, but in three uniform parts, each of which contains three"
5249,NOTES.,"stanzas. The first of these parts is called the _Strophe_, or Turn; the"
5250,NOTES.,"second, the _Antistrophe_, or Counter-turn; the third, the _Epode_, or"
5251,NOTES.,After-song. The origin of these terms may be traced to the use of the
5252,NOTES.,ode as an important part of the entertainment presented in the ancient
5253,NOTES.,Greek theatre. The Strophe was sung while the chorus moved from one side
5254,NOTES.,of the orchestra to the other; the Antistrophe while the reversed
5255,NOTES.,movement was being made; and the Epodos after the singers had returned
5256,NOTES.,to their original position. The accurate perception of harmony and the
5257,NOTES.,"relationship between the different parts of the choral ode, which"
5258,NOTES.,"enabled the Greeks to enter thoroughly into its enjoyment, is unknown"
5259,NOTES.,"among moderns. Hence, there have been but few attempts in the English"
5260,NOTES.,language to construct odes strictly after the Greek model. Most of our
5261,NOTES.,"odes are poems relating to themes of greater or less varying length, and"
5262,NOTES.,divided into many irregular stanzas of varying lengths and metres. Such
5263,NOTES.,"are Dryden's ""Alexander's Feast,"" Keats's ""Ode to a Nightingale,"" and"
5264,NOTES.,"Wordsworth's ""Ode on the Intimations of Immortality,"" all of which are"
5265,NOTES.,"odes in form and style, although differing from their Greek prototype"
5266,NOTES.,"and from one another. Of all English poets, none have worked so"
5267,NOTES.,"thoroughly on the ancient model as Gray, although to Congreve must be"
5268,NOTES.,given the honor of being the first to attempt this species of English
5269,NOTES.,composition.

5486,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"THOMAS GRAY was born in Cornhill, London, December 26th, 1716. Through"
5487,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the help of his mother's brother, who was Assistant-Master at that"
5488,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"famous school, he received his primary education at Eton, and in 1735"
5489,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"entered St. Peter's College, Cambridge. In 1738 he left the University"
5490,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"without taking a degree, intending to study law at the Inner Temple."
5491,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Soon afterwards, however, he accompanied Horace Walpole on a tour"
5492,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"through France and Italy, and spent the greater part of two years in"
5493,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Paris, Rome, and Florence. Upon his return to England, finding himself"
5494,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"possessed of a life-long competency, he resolved to give up the law and"
5495,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"devote himself entirely to self-culture. He settled at Cambridge, and"
5496,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,gave all his time to study and to the cultivation of his mind. The first
5497,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of his poems to appear in print was the ""Ode on a Distant Prospect of"
5498,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Eton College,"" published in 1747. His ""Elegy Written in a Country"
5499,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Churchyard"" was not published until 1750, although it had been written"
5500,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,and handed about in manuscript several years before. The post of
5501,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Poet-Laureate was offered him in 1757, on the death of Colley Cibber;"
5502,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,but he did not accept it. In 1768 he was appointed Professor of Modern
5503,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"History at Cambridge, but the state of his health was such that he was"
5504,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"never permitted to lecture. He died, July 29th, 1771, at the age of"
5505,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,fifty-four.
5506,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
5507,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""He was certainly the most accomplished man of his time,"" says Hales,"
5508,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""and was something much more than accomplished. His learning was not"
5509,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"only wide but deep; his taste, if perhaps too fastidious, was pure and"
5510,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,thorough; his genius was of no mean degree or order; his affections were
5511,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,of the truest and sincerest. . . . His poems are works of refinement
5512,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,rather than of passion; but yet they are inspired with genuine
5513,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,sentiment. They are no doubt extremely artificial in form; the weight of
5514,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,their author's reading somewhat depresses their originality; he can with
5515,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,difficulty escape from his books to himself; but yet there is in him a
5516,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"genuine poetical spirit. His poetry, however elaborated, is sincere and"
5517,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,truthful. If the exterior is what Horace might have called over-filed

5985,NOTES.,NOTES.
5986,NOTES.,
5987,NOTES.,This poem was written in 1708 at the suggestion of Sir Richard Steele;
5988,NOTES.,"it was set to music by Maurice Greene, and in 1730 was performed at the"
5989,NOTES.,"public commemoration at Cambridge. Its model is Dryden's famous ode,"
5990,NOTES.,"""Alexander's Feast,"" of which Pope was a warm admirer (see page 159)."
5991,NOTES.,"Dr. Johnson says; ""In his 'Ode on St. Cecilia's Day' Pope is generally"
5992,NOTES.,confessed to have miscarried; yet he has miscarried only as compared
5993,NOTES.,"with Dryden, for he has far outgone other competitors. Dryden's plan is"
5994,NOTES.,better chosen; history will always take stronger hold of the passions
5995,NOTES.,than fable: the passions excited by Dryden are the pleasures and pains
5996,NOTES.,of real life; the scene of Pope is laid in imaginary existence; Pope is
5997,NOTES.,"read with calm acquiescence, Dryden with turbulent delight; Pope hangs"
5998,NOTES.,"upon the ear, Dryden finds the passes of the mind. Both the odes want"
5999,NOTES.,"the essential constituent of metrical compositions, the stated"
6000,NOTES.,recurrence of settled numbers. . . . If Pope's ode be particularly
6001,NOTES.,"inspected, it will be found that the first stanza consists of sounds,"
6002,NOTES.,"well chosen, indeed, but only sounds. The second consists of"
6003,NOTES.,"hyperbolical commonplaces, easily to be found, and, perhaps, without"
6004,NOTES.,"much difficulty to be as well expressed. In the third, however, there"
6005,NOTES.,"are numbers, images, harmony, and vigor not unworthy the antagonist of"
6006,NOTES.,Dryden. Had all been like this--but every part cannot be the best. The
6007,NOTES.,next stanzas place and detain us in the dark and dismal regions of
6008,NOTES.,mythology; . . . we have all that can be performed by elegance of
6009,NOTES.,diction or sweetness of versification; but what can form avail without
6010,NOTES.,better matter? The last stanza again refers to commonplaces. The
6011,NOTES.,conclusion is too evidently modelled by that of Dryden; and it may be
6012,NOTES.,remarked that both end with the same fault--the comparison of each is
6013,NOTES.,literal on one side and metaphorical on the other. Poets do not always
6014,NOTES.,"express their own thoughts. Pope, with all this labor in the praise of"
6015,NOTES.,"music, was ignorant of its principles and insensible of its effects."""
6016,NOTES.,
6017,NOTES.,"St. Cecilia, the Christian Polyhymnia and patron saint of sacred music,"
6018,NOTES.,is said to have suffered martyrdom about the year 230. In Chaucer's
6019,NOTES.,"""Seconde Nonnes Tale""--which is an almost literal translation of the"
6020,NOTES.,"""Legenda Aurea,"" written in the thirteenth century--it is related that,"
6021,NOTES.,"on account of Cecilia's spotless purity, an angel came down from heaven"

6042,NOTES.,the first organs used in Italy are said to have been brought thither
6043,NOTES.,from Greece. Some of the Roman churches are known to have had them in

6176,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,ALEXANDER POPE was born in London in 1688. He had some instruction at
6177,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"home, and was afterwards sent, first to a Roman Catholic seminary near"
6178,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Winchester, then to another in London. ""This,"" he said, ""was all the"
6179,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"teaching I ever had, and God knows it extended a very little way. When I"
6180,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"had done with my priests, I took to reading by myself, for which I had a"
6181,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"very great eagerness and enthusiasm, especially for poetry: and in a few"
6182,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"years I had dipped into a very great number of the English, Italian,"
6183,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Latin, and Greek poets."" He was small of stature and deformed, and his"
6184,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ill health made him peevish, irritable, and selfish. Yet his rare"
6185,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,intellectual abilities and the deserved success of his earlier poetry
6186,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,secured for him the friendship of many of the most influential men of
6187,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,the time. Bolingbroke declared that he never knew a man more tenderly
6188,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"devoted to his friends; and Warburton said, ""He is as good a companion"
6189,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"as poet, and, what is more, appears to be a good man."""

6191,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Pope's ""Essay on Criticism"" was published in 1711; the ""Rape of the"

6193,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Odyssey"" in 1726; the ""Dunciad"" in 1728; the ""Essay on Man"" in 1732. A"
6194,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"revised and enlarged version of the ""Dunciad"" was published in 1742. The"
6195,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"latter part of Pope's life was spent at his country-seat of Twickenham,"
6196,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,which he enlarged and beautified from the proceeds of his translation of
6197,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Homer. He died in 1744.

6541,NOTES.,"Feast of St. Cecilia, and I was so struck with the subject which"

6543,NOTES.,"it is, finished at one sitting."""
6544,NOTES.,
6545,NOTES.,"The poem was first set to music by one Jeremiah Clarke, a steward of the"

6562,NOTES.,"overthrown the Persian Empire, held a great feast at Persepolis in"
6563,NOTES.,"celebration of his victories. At the close of the revelries, instigated,"
6564,NOTES.,"it is said, by Thais, his Athenian mistress, he set fire with his own"

6573,NOTES.,"3. =Thais.= ""Her name is best known from the story of her having"

6613,NOTES.,11. =expos'd he lies.= Dryden seems to have written this under the

6676,NOTES.,
6677,NOTES.,"20. =Furies.= The Eumenides, or avengers of evil. They are variously"

6680,NOTES.,
6681,NOTES.,21. =Grecian ghosts.= The spirits of the Greek warriors in Alexander's
6682,NOTES.,army who had been slain by the Persians.
6683,NOTES.,
6684,NOTES.,22. =crew.= This word was formerly used to designate any associated
6685,NOTES.,multitude or assemblage of persons. It is now restricted to a ship's
6686,NOTES.,"company, except when occasionally used in a bad sense. From A.-S."
6687,NOTES.,"_cread_ or _cruth_, a crowd."
6688,NOTES.,
6689,NOTES.,"23. =Thais led the way, etc.= See note 19, above. Neither Thais nor Helen"
6690,NOTES.,"actually fired any city. What the poet means to say is that, as Helen"
6691,NOTES.,"was the cause of the destruction of Troy, so Thais instigated the"
6692,NOTES.,burning of Persepolis.
6693,NOTES.,
6694,NOTES.,"24. =organs.= The word _organ_ originally denoted but a single pipe, and"
6695,NOTES.,"hence the older English writers, when referring to the complete"
6696,NOTES.,"instrument, generally used the word in the plural number. ""Father"
6697,NOTES.,Schmidt and other famous organ-builders flourished in the latter part of

6704,NOTES.,
6705,NOTES.,"26. St. Cecilia, according to the story in the ""Golden Legend,"" was"
6706,NOTES.,under the immediate protection of an angel. But it was not her sweet

6717,NOTES.,of its images; the succession of so many different passions and
6718,NOTES.,feelings; and the matchless perspicuity of its diction. No particle of

6725,NOTES.,It used to pass for the best work of Dryden and the best ode in the
6726,NOTES.,"language. But few lines are highly poetical, and some sink to the level"
6727,NOTES.,of a common drinking song. It has the defects as well as the merits of
6728,NOTES.,"that poetry which is written for musical accompaniment."""

6876,NOTES.,"This selection from Dryden's long and very tedious poem, ""Annus"
6877,NOTES.,"Mirabilis, the year of Wonders, 1666,"" is given here as a specimen of"
6878,NOTES.,that kind of mechanical versification so popular in the latter half of
6879,NOTES.,"the seventeenth century. ""That part of my poem which describes the"
6880,NOTES.,"Fire,"" says Dryden, ""I owe first to the piety and fatherly affection of"
6881,NOTES.,"our monarch to his suffering subjects; and, in the second place, to the"
6882,NOTES.,"courage, loyalty, and magnanimity of the city; both of which were so"
6883,NOTES.,conspicuous that I have wanted words to celebrate them as they deserve.
6884,NOTES.,And I have chosen to write my poem in quatrains or stanzas of four in
6885,NOTES.,"alternate rhyme, because I have ever judged them more noble, and of"
6886,NOTES.,"greater dignity, both for the sound and number, than any other verse in"
6887,NOTES.,"use amongst us."" This opinion, however, was certainly not long"
6888,NOTES.,"maintained by the poet, for he never afterward practised that form of"
6889,NOTES.,versification which he has here praised.

6897,NOTES.,"_Pudding-lane_ near _New Fish-street_; which, falling out in a part of"
6898,NOTES.,the city so close built with wooden houses . . . in a short time became
6899,NOTES.,too big to be mastered by any engines or working near it. . . . It
6900,NOTES.,"continued all Monday and Tuesday with such impetuosity, that it consumed"

6902,NOTES.,"_Fleet-street_; at which time, by the favour of God, the wind slackened;"

6904,NOTES.,"his Majesty and his Royal Highness, calling upon all people, and"
6905,NOTES.,"encouraging them by their personal assistances, a stop was put to the"
6906,NOTES.,"fire in Fleet-street, etc. But on Wednesday night it suddenly broke out"

6978,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"JOHN DRYDEN was born on the 9th of August, 1631, at Aldwincle All"
6979,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Saints, near Oundle in Northamptonshire. He was educated at Westminster"
6980,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"School, under the famous Dr. Busby, and at Trinity College, Cambridge."
6981,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,At the age of twenty-six he went up to London with the intention of
6982,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,devoting himself to literature and politics. During the brief remaining
6983,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,years of the Commonwealth (1657-1660) he was nominally a friend to the
6984,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Puritan party; and one of the first poems written by him was a series of
6985,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Heroic Stanzas on the Death of Oliver Cromwell."" At the Restoration he"
6986,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,at once espoused the cause of the Royalists; and his recent panegyric on
6987,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the Protector did not prevent him from writing a poem, ""Astræa Redux,"""
6988,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,in honor of the return of Charles the Second. In 1663 he married the
6989,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Lady Elizabeth Howard, a daughter of the Earl of Berkshire, a Royalist"
6990,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,nobleman. For several years he devoted himself chiefly to the writing of
6991,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"plays,--comedies, tragedies, and tragi-comedies. The comedies he wrote"
6992,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in prose; the earliest tragedies in blank verse, followed by several in"
6993,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"rhyme, and, after these, others in blank verse. In 1670 he was appointed"
6994,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Poet-Laureate. In 1681, when nearly fifty years old, by the publication"
6995,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of ""Absalom and Achitophel,"" he suddenly became famous as a satirical"
6996,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poet. He soon afterwards wrote ""The Medal,"" another satire, directed"
6997,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"against the Earl of Shaftesbury, and ""Mac Flecknoe,"" aimed at Shadwell,"
6998,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,the chief poet of the Opposition. At about the same time he produced
6999,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Religio Laici,"" a didactic poem explaining his religious opinions and"
7000,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"defending the Church of England against dissenters, atheists, and"
7001,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Catholics. Not long after the accession of James II., Dryden, true to"
7002,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"his policy of being always on the side of the ruling party, became a"
7003,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Catholic, and wrote ""The Hind and the Panther,"" in which he eulogized"
7004,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"many things that, in the former poem, he had ridiculed. His political"
7005,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"career ended with the overthrow of James II., in 1688; but his literary"
7006,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,activity continued unabated. The last years of his life were occupied in
7007,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,translating the works of Persius and Juvenal and the Æneid of Virgil. In
7008,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"1697 he wrote ""Alexander's Feast""; and his ""modernizations"" of some of"
7009,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Chaucer's poems appeared in 1700, the year of his death."
7010,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
7011,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""If there is grandeur in the pomp of kings and the march of hosts,"" says"
7012,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"A. W. Ward, ""in the 'trumpet's loud clangor' and in tapestries and"
7013,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"carpetings of velvet and gold, Dryden is to be ranked with the grandest"
7014,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,of English poets. The irresistible impetus of an invective which never
7015,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"falls short or flat, and the savor of a satire which never seems dull or"
7016,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"stale, give him an undisputed place among the most glorious of English"
7017,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"wits."""

7019,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""His descriptive power was of the highest,"" says Hales. ""Our literature"
7020,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,has in it no more vigorous portrait-gallery than that he has bequeathed
7021,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,it. His power of expression is beyond praise. There is always a singular
7022,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,_fitness_ in his language: he uses always the right word. He is one of
7023,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"our greatest masters of metre: metre was, in fact, no restraint to him,"
7024,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,but rather it seems to have given him freedom. It has been observed that
7025,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,he argues better in verse than in prose; verse was the natural costume
7026,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of his thoughts."""

7880,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"1608, eight years before the death of Shakespeare. From his boyhood he"
7881,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,showed the possession of more than ordinary powers of mind. He was

7883,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"finally at Christ's College, Cambridge, where in 1632 he received the"
7884,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"degree of ""Master of Arts."" His first considerable work was the ""Hymn on"
7885,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the Morning of the Nativity,"" written in 1629. Within the next seven"
7886,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"years he wrote the most noteworthy of his shorter poems: the masque,"
7887,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Comus""; the pastoral piece entitled ""Arcades""; the beautiful"
7888,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"descriptive poems, ""L'Allegro"" and ""II Penseroso""; and the elegy,"
7889,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Lycidas."" In 1639 he made a tour upon the Continent, visited the famous"

7891,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of the great poets and scholars of his time. Upon hearing, however, that"
7892,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"civil war was about to break out in England, he hastened home, resolved"

7900,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,his life to the writing of the great poem which he had been
7901,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,contemplating for many years. Through unceasing study he had lost his
7902,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,sight; the friends of his youth had deserted him; the fortune which he
7903,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"had received from his father was gone. And so it was in darkness, and"
7904,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"disappointment, and poverty, that in 1667 he gave to the world the great"
7905,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"English epic, ""Paradise Lost."" It was in that same year that Dryden"
7906,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"published his ""Annus Mirabilis."" Milton shortly afterward wrote"
7907,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Paradise Regained""; and, in 1671, he produced ""Samson Agonistes,"" a"

8118,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ROBERT HERRICK was born in Cheapside, London, August 20, 1591. He was"
8119,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"educated at Cambridge, and in 1629, having taken orders, was presented"
8120,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,to the vicarage of Dean Prior in Devonshire. From this living he was
8121,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ejected by the Long Parliament in 1648, and, going up to London, he"
8122,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,united himself with some of his former associates and entered upon a
8123,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,career not altogether creditable to his profession of parson. At the
8124,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"restoration of Charles II. he was returned to his vicarage, where he"
8125,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,remained until his death in 1674. His best poems are included in the
8126,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"collection entitled ""Hesperides, or Works Humane and Divine,"" published"
8127,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in 1648, and dedicated to ""the most illustrious and most hopeful Prince"
8128,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Charles."" The ""Argument"" prefixed to this collection very prettily"
8129,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,describes the character of the pieces which it contains:
8130,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
8131,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds, and bowers,"
8132,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Of April, May, of June, and July-flowers;"
8133,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"I sing of May-poles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes,"
8134,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Of bride-grooms, brides, and of their bridal-cakes."
8135,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"I write of Youth, of Love;--and have access"
8136,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"By these, to sing of cleanly wantonness;"
8137,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"I sing of dews, of rains, and, piece by piece,"
8138,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Of balm, of oil, of spice, of ambergris."
8139,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,I sing of times trans-shifting; and I write
8140,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"How roses first came red, and lilies white."
8141,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"I write of groves, of twilights, and I sing"
8142,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"The court of Mab, and of the Fairy King;"

8148,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"gladsome, mercurial temper had a great deal to do with the composition"
8149,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of his best lyrics; for the parson of Dean Prior was no philosopher, and"
8150,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"his lightest, airiest verses are the best. His was a happy, careless"

8259,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"EDMUND WALLER, whose poetry is noticeable because he was the first"
8260,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"English versifier to adopt the French fashion of writing in couplets,"
8261,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was born in Warwickshire in 1605. He was elected to Parliament at the
8262,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"age of seventeen, and was a member of that body during the greater part"
8263,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,of his life. At the beginning of the difficulties between the king and
8264,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the Parliament, he gained some notoriety by his opposition to the"
8265,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"former, but when the Civil War broke out he attached himself to the"
8266,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Royalist cause. In 1643, being convicted of complicity in a plot against"
8267,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Parliament, he was fined £10,000 and imprisoned for twelve months. After"
8268,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,his release he went to France; but in 1653 he returned to England and
8269,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"became reconciled to the new government, writing, soon afterward, ""A"
8270,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Panegyric to my Lord Protector, of the present Greatness and joint"
8271,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Interest of his Highness and this Nation."" At the Restoration he eagerly"
8272,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"declared allegiance to Charles II., and wrote a congratulatory ode on"
8273,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"that monarch's return. He became a court favorite, noted for his wit,"
8274,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"was made provost of Eton, and returned to his old place in Parliament."
8275,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"He died October 21, 1687. The first edition of his poems was published"
8276,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in 1645, and from that time to the close of the seventeenth century he"
8277,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was quite generally regarded as the greatest of English poets. At the
8278,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,present time there are few writers so little considered as he.
8279,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
8280,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Waller may be regarded as the founder of the classical school of English
8281,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poetry, in which Dryden and Pope excelled, and which remained in the"
8282,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ascendency for more than a century after his death. ""The excellence and"
8283,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"dignity of rhyme,"" says Dryden, ""were never fully known till Mr. Waller"
8284,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"taught it; he first made writing easily an art, first showed us to"
8285,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"conclude the sense, most commonly, in distichs, which in the verse of"
8286,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"those before him runs on for so many lines together, that the reader is"
8287,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"out of breath to overtake it."""
8288,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
8289,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"And Dr. Johnson says: ""He certainly very much excelled in smoothness"
8290,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,most of the writers who were living when his poetry commenced. But he
8291,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was rather smooth than strong: of the 'full resounding line' which Pope
8292,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"attributes to Dryden, he has given very few examples. The general"
8293,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,character of his poetry is elegance and gaiety. He seems neither to have
8294,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"had a mind much elevated by nature, nor amplified by learning. His"
8295,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,thoughts are such as a liberal conversation and large acquaintance with
8296,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"life would easily supply."""

8551,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"BEN JONSON was born in Westminster, in 1573. His early life was full of"
8552,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"hard and varied experiences. He was educated at Westminster School, and"
8553,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"entered St. John's College, Cambridge. Being obliged to leave his"
8554,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"university course unfinished, he worked for a time with his step-father"
8555,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,as a brick-layer. At the age of eighteen he enlisted as a volunteer in
8556,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the Low Countries; but in 1596 he settled in London, as a playwright."
8557,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"His first comedy, ""Every Man in his Humour,"" did not meet with immediate"
8558,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"success. It was remodelled, at Shakespeare's suggestion, and when"
8559,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"afterwards presented was received with marked favor. His first tragedy,"
8560,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Sejanus,"" was acted in 1603. His masques, of which there are"
8561,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"thirty-six, were written during the reign of James I. His miscellaneous"
8562,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"works, embracing a variety of odes, elegies, epigrams, and other lyrics"
8563,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"and epistles, are included in two collections, the first of which,"
8564,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"called _The Forest_, was published in 1616, and the second posthumously,"
8565,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in 1641. He died in London, August 6, 1637."
8566,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
8567,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,One of the last and most beautiful of Jonson's dramas is the unfinished
8568,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"pastoral comedy, ""The Sad Shepherd."" It was written while in the"
8569,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"sick-chamber, with a keen sense and remembrance of the disappointments"
8570,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,which had followed him through life; and to these he touchingly refers
8571,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,in the prologue:
8572,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
8573,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""He that hath feasted you these forty years,"
8574,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"And fitted fables for your finer ears,"
8575,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Although at first he scarce could hit the bore;
8576,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Yet you, with patience, hearkening more and more,"
8577,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"At length have grown up to him, and made known"
8578,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,The working of his pen is now your own:
8579,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"He prays you would vouchsafe, for your own sake,"
8580,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"To hear him this once more, but sit awake."
8581,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,And though he now present you with such wool
8582,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"As from mere English flocks his muse can pull,"
8583,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"He hopes when it is made up into cloth,"
8584,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Not the most curious head here will be loth
8585,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"To wear a hood of it, it being a fleece,"
8586,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,To match or those of Sicily or Greece.
8587,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"His scene is Sherwood, and his play a tale"
8588,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Of Robin Hood's inviting from the vale
8589,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Of Belvoir, all the shepherds to a feast;"
8590,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Where, by the casual absence of one guest,"
8591,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"The mirth is troubled much, and in one man"
8592,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"As much of sadness shown as passion can."""

8881,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE was born at Stratford-on-Avon in April, 1564, and"
8882,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"died there April 23, 1616. His fame rests chiefly upon his dramatic"
8883,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"compositions. His two narrative poems, ""Venus and Adonis"" and ""The Rape"
8884,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of Lucrece,"" were published in 1593 and 1594, before any of his plays"
8885,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"had been printed. They may be regarded as companion pieces, written in"

8888,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""A couple of ice-houses,"" says Dowden, ""these two poems of Shakespeare"
8889,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"have been called by Hazlitt; 'they are,' he says, 'as hard, as"
8890,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"glittering, as cold.' Cold indeed they will seem to any one who listens"
8891,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,to hear in them the natural cry of human passion. But the paradox is
8892,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"true, that for a young poet of Elizabeth's age to be natural, direct,"
8893,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"simple, would have been indeed unnatural. He was most happy when most"
8894,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,fantastical; he spun a shining web to catch conceits inevitably as a
8895,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,spider casts his thread; the quick-building wit was itself warm while
8896,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"erecting its ice-houses."" Coleridge says of the ""Venus and Adonis"" that"
8897,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"its most obvious excellence ""is the perfect sweetness of the"
8898,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,versification; its adaptation to the subject; and the power displayed in
8899,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,varying the march of the words without passing into a loftier and more

8906,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"says Fleay; ""some as several poems--of groups of sonnets; some as"
8907,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,containing a separate poem in each sonnet. They have been supposed to be
8908,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"written in Shakespeare's own person, or in the character of another, or"
8909,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,of several others; to be autobiographical or heterobiographical or
8910,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"allegorical; to have been addressed to Lord Southampton, to Sir William"
8911,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Herbert, to his own wife, to Lady Rich, to his child, to himself, to his"
8912,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Muse."" The safest and wisest course seems to be, first to regard each of"
8913,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the one hundred and fifty-four sonnets as a poem complete in itself, and"
8914,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"after studying whatever it may contain of art, or beauty, or truth, then"

9829,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
9830,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,EDMUND SPENSER was born in London about the year 1552. He was educated
9831,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"at Merchant Taylor's school, and in 1569 went to Cambridge University,"
9832,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,where he entered Pembroke Hall as a sizar. In the same year his first
9833,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,poetical performances--translations from Petrarch and Du Bellay--were
9834,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,published in a miscellaneous collection without the name of the author.
9835,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,At the University he was zealously devoted to the study of Latin and
9836,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Greek literature, and there he made the acquaintance of several students"
9837,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,who afterwards became men of note. In 1579 he visited Sir Philip Sidney
9838,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"at Penshurst, with whom he afterwards spent some time in London at the"
9839,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"house of Sidney's uncle, the Earl of Leicester. In 1580 was published,"
9840,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"but without his name, his first considerable poem, ""The Shepheards"
9841,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Calendar""; and in the autumn of the same year he went to Ireland as"
9842,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"secretary to Lord Grey of Wilton, the new Lord Lieutenant. With the"
9843,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"exception of a few brief visits made to England, the remainder of his"
9844,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,life was spent partly in Dublin and partly at Kilcolman Castle on a
9845,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,grant of forfeited land in the county of Cork. Between 1580 and 1589 he
9846,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"wrote the first three books of ""The Faerie Queene,"" and in 1590 they"
9847,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"were published in London, through the influence of Sir Walter Raleigh,"
9848,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,who had recently visited the poet in Ireland. In the summer of 1594 he
9849,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"married a lady named Elizabeth, probably the daughter of some English"
9850,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,settler in Ireland; and in the following year he carried to London and
9851,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"published the second three books of ""The Faerie Queene."" At about the"
9852,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"same time were published his ""Colin Clout's Come Home Again,"" and his"
9853,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Amoretti Sonnets,"" and an ""Epithalamium"" relating to his courtship and"
9854,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"marriage. Returning to Ireland, he resumed his labor upon the"
9855,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"half-completed ""Faerie Queene,"" but it was rudely interrupted by the"
9856,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,breaking out of an insurrection among the Irish. In 1598 Spenser's house
9857,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"was sacked and burned by the rebels, and it was with the greatest"
9858,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"difficulty that he and his family escaped with their lives. Indeed, it"
9859,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"is stated, on the authority of Ben Jonson, that one little child"
9860,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,perished in the flames. Spenser returned to London in poverty and great
9861,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"distress, and on the 16th of January, 1599, he died in King Street,"
9862,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Westminster. He was buried in the Abbey.
9863,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
9864,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Spenser has been very appropriately named ""the poets' poet."" ""For,"" says"
9865,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Leigh Hunt, ""he has had more idolatry and imitation from his brethren"
9866,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"than all the rest put together. The old undramatic poets, Drayton,"
9867,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Browne, Drummond, and Giles and Phineas Fletcher, were as full of him as"
9868,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the dramatic were of Shakespeare. Milton studied and used him, calling"
9869,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,him 'sage and serious Spenser'; and adding that he 'dared be known to
9870,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,think him a better teacher than Scotus and Aquinas.' Cowley said he
9871,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,became a poet by reading him. Dryden claimed him for a master. Pope said
9872,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,he read him with as much pleasure when he was old as when he was young.
9873,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Collins and Gray loved him. Thomson, Shenstone, and a host of inferior"
9874,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"writers expressly imitated him. Burns, Byron, Shelley, and Keats made"
9875,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"use of his stanza. Coleridge eulogized him."""

9878,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Taine declares that no modern is more like Homer than he.

9880,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,With reference to the peculiar forms of language--comparatively obsolete
9881,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"even when ""The Faerie Queene"" was composed--which are so marked a"
9882,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"characteristic of Spenser's poetry, Hales says: ""The subject he chose"
9883,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"for his great work drew him into the midst of the old times of chivalry,"
9884,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,and the literature that belonged to them. With such a subject the older
9885,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"forms of the language seemed to consort better. To him, too, perhaps, as"
9886,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"to Virgil, the older words and word-forms seemed to give elevation and"
9887,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"dignity. Moreover, an older dialect was probably to some extent his"
9888,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"vernacular, as he had probably passed his youth in Lancashire. Lastly,"
9889,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the only great poet who had preceded him, his great model, the Tityrus"
9890,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of whom he 'his songs did lere,' was Chaucer. To him Chaucer's language"
9891,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"may have seemed the one language of English poetry."""

10591,NOTES.,
10592,NOTES.,Among the earliest and most popular of English ballads are those
10593,NOTES.,"relating to Robin Hood. This noted, half-mythical outlaw was the"
10594,NOTES.,impersonation of popular rights as they were understood by Englishmen of
10595,NOTES.,the lower orders in the days of the Plantagenets. Hence the memory of
10596,NOTES.,"him and his reputed deeds was preserved in the songs of the people. ""It"
10597,NOTES.,"is he,"" says an old historian, ""whom the common people love so dearly to"
10598,NOTES.,"celebrate in games and comedies, and whose history, sung by fiddlers,"
10599,NOTES.,"interests them more than any other."" Even so late as the reign of Edward"
10600,NOTES.,"VI., ""Robyn Hoode's Daye"" was very generally observed in the country"
10601,NOTES.,parishes as a day of feasting and amusement.
10602,NOTES.,
10603,NOTES.,The ballads were originally the production of wandering minstrels or
10604,NOTES.,"gleemen, a class of men very popular in the Middle Ages, who followed"
10605,NOTES.,the profession of poetry and music. These rude poets were held in the
10606,NOTES.,highest esteem and veneration by the people among whom they lived; they
10607,NOTES.,"were received and welcomed wherever they went, and even kings delighted"
10608,NOTES.,"to honor them. In short, their art was supposed, by the Anglo-Saxons,"
10609,NOTES.,"to be of divine origin, having been invented by Odin, the great"
10610,NOTES.,"All-Father, and perfected by Bragi, the musician of the gods. As,"
10611,NOTES.,"however, civilization advanced and Christianity became established, this"
10612,NOTES.,admiration for the minstrel and his art became modified in a degree. He
10613,NOTES.,"was no longer regarded as a poet, but only as a singer, a sweet"
10614,NOTES.,musician. Poetry was cultivated by men of leisure and refinement; but
10615,NOTES.,lyrical ballads remained the peculiar inheritance of the minstrel. For a
10616,NOTES.,"long time after the Norman conquest, minstrels continued to gain their"
10617,NOTES.,"livelihood by singing in the houses of the great, and at festive"
10618,NOTES.,"occasions, which were never considered complete unless graced by the"
10619,NOTES.,presence of these honored descendants of Bragi; nor did they cease to
10620,NOTES.,compose and sing their inimitable pieces until near the close of
10621,NOTES.,Elizabeth's reign. The greater number of the ballads now in existence
10622,NOTES.,were probably produced during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; and
10623,NOTES.,"the best of them originated in the ""North Country,"" or the border region"
10624,NOTES.,"between England and Scotland. They were not at first reduced to writing,"
10625,NOTES.,but were handed down from one generation to another merely by oral
10626,NOTES.,"tradition. As regards their metre and versification, the ballads were"
10627,NOTES.,commonly composed of iambic hexameters or heptameters rhyming in
10628,NOTES.,"couplets. These couplets are readily broken into stanzas of four lines,"
10629,NOTES.,in which form they are usually printed.
10630,NOTES.,
10631,NOTES.,The first collection of English ballads ever published was probably that
10632,NOTES.,"of John Dryden, in 1684. The collection was included in a volume"
10633,NOTES.,entitled _Miscellany Poems_. In 1723 a work called _A Collection of Old
10634,NOTES.,Ballads_ was published anonymously. In 1724 Allan Ramsay issued _The
10635,NOTES.,"Evergreen_, ""being a collection of Scots Poems wrote by the Ingenious"
10636,NOTES.,"before 1600."" This work included many popular songs and ballads. It was"
10637,NOTES.,reprinted in 1875.
10638,NOTES.,
10639,NOTES.,We owe the preservation of a large number of the most interesting and
10640,NOTES.,"beautiful ballads to Bishop Percy, who, in 1765, published the first"
10641,NOTES.,really valuable collection of such works in his _Reliques of Ancient
10642,NOTES.,English Poetry_. Previous to that time most of these songs had existed
10643,NOTES.,"only in manuscript, or, if printed at all, in the cheapest style of"
10644,NOTES.,"typography, on sheets designed for circulation among the poor. Bishop"
10645,NOTES.,Percy's work first called the attention of scholars to the value and
10646,NOTES.,"beauty of these neglected and half-forgotten relics, and did much to"
10647,NOTES.,bring about that revolution in literature which took place in the latter
10648,NOTES.,"part of the last century. And it is to these old ballads, thus rescued"
10649,NOTES.,"from oblivion, that we owe very many of the noblest literary productions"
10650,NOTES.,of the present century. We know that they were the immediate inspiration
10651,NOTES.,"of Sir Walter Scott, and that they exerted a wonderful influence in"
10652,NOTES.,modifying and directing the taste and style of many other distinguished
10653,NOTES.,writers.

10662,NOTES.,and eighty years before we alight upon a period presenting anything like
10663,NOTES.,an adequate show of literary continuation. A few smaller names are all
10664,NOTES.,that can be cited as poetical representatives of this sterile interval
10665,NOTES.,in the literary history of England: whatever of Chaucer's genius still
10666,NOTES.,lingered in the island seeming to have travelled northward and taken
10667,NOTES.,"refuge in a series of Scotch poets, excelling any of their English"
10668,NOTES.,contemporaries. We are driven to suppose that there was something in the
10669,NOTES.,social circumstances of England during the long period in question which
10670,NOTES.,prevented such talent as there was from assuming the particular form of
10671,NOTES.,literature. Fully to make out what this 'something' was may baffle us;
10672,NOTES.,"but, when we remember that this was the period of the Civil Wars of the"
10673,NOTES.,"Roses, we have reason to believe that the dearth of pure literature may"

10825,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the friend of Caxton, the first English printer, and of Percy, Earl of"
10826,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Northumberland. He was poet-laureate under Henry VII., and tutor of the"
10827,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"young prince (afterwards Henry VIII.), and was described by Erasmus as"
10828,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,_litterarum Anglicarum lumen et decus_. Later in life he was promoted to
10829,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the rectory of Diss in Norfolk, but was severely censured by his bishop"
10830,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,for his buffooneries in the pulpit and his satirical ballads against the
10831,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,mendicants. He finally became a hanger-on about the court of Henry
10832,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"VIII.; and, daring to write a rhyming libel on Cardinal Wolsey, was"
10833,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,driven to take refuge in the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey. There he
10834,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,was kindly entertained and protected by Abbot Islip until his death in

11338,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"GAWAIN DOUGLAS was a son of the famous Earl of Angus, and was born in"
11339,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"Brechin, Scotland, about 1474. He was educated partly at the University"

11342,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"IV. It is an allegory, such as was at that time the staple of poetical"

11377,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"Chaucer's divine liquidness of diction, his divine fluidity of movement,"
11378,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"it is difficult to speak temperately. They are irresistible, and justify"

11382,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"his diction, the lovely charm of his movement, he makes an epoch and"
11383,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"founds a tradition. In Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, we can"
11384,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,"follow the tradition of the liquid diction, the fluid movement, of"
11385,FOUR POETS OF THIS CENTURY.,Chaucer; at one time it is his liquid diction of which in these poets we
