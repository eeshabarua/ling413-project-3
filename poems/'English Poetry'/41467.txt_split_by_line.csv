88,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
89,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
90,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
91,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From ’41 to ’51
92,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I was my folk’s contrary son;
93,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I bit my father’s hand right through
94,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And broke my mother’s heart in two.
95,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I sometimes go without my dinner
96,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Now that I know the times I’ve gi’n her.
97,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
98,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From ’51 to ’6l
99,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I cut my teeth and took to fun.
100,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I learned what not to be afraid of
101,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And what stuff women’s lips are made of;
102,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I learned with what a rosy feeling
103,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Good ale makes floors seem like the ceiling,"
104,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how the moon gives shiny light
105,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To lads as roll home singing by’t.
106,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My blood did leap, my flesh did revel,"
107,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Saul Kane was tokened to the devil.
108,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
109,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From ’61 to ’67
110,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I lived in disbelief of heaven.
111,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I drunk, I fought, I poached, I whored,"
112,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I did despite unto the Lord,"
113,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I cursed, ’twould make a man look pale,"
114,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And nineteen times I went to jail.
115,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Now, friends, observe and look upon me,"
116,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Mark how the Lord took pity on me.
117,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
118,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"By Dead Man’s Thorn, while setting wires,"
119,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Who should come up but Billy Myers,"
120,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A friend of mine, who used to be"
121,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"As black a sprig of hell as me,"
122,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With whom I’d planned, to save encroachin’,"
123,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Which fields and coverts each should poach in.
124,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Now when he saw me set my snare,"
125,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He tells me ’Get to hell from there.
126,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"This field is mine,’ he says, ’by right;"
127,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"If you poach here, there’ll be a fight."
128,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Out now,’ he says, ’and leave your wire;"
129,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,It’s mine.’
130,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’It ain’t.’
131,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You put.’
132,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You liar.’
133,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
134,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You closhy put.’
135,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You bloody liar.’
136,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’This is my field.’
137,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’This is my wire.’
138,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I’m ruler here.’
139,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You ain’t.’
140,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I am.’
141,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I’ll fight you for it.’
142,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Right, by damn."
143,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Not now, though, I’ve a-sprained my thumb,"
144,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,We’ll fight after the harvest hum.
145,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Silas Jones, that bookie wide,"
146,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Will make a purse five pounds a side.’
147,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Those were the words, that was the place"
148,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,By which God brought me into grace.
149,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
150,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,On Wood Top Field the peewits go
151,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Mewing and wheeling ever so;
152,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And like the shaking of a timbrel
153,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Cackles the laughter of the whimbrel.
154,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In the old quarry-pit they say
155,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Head-keeper Pike was made away.
156,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
157,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He walks, head-keeper Pike, for harm,"
158,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He taps the windows of the farm;
159,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The blood drips from his broken chin,"
160,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He taps and begs to be let in.
161,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"On Wood Top, nights, I’ve shaked to hark"
162,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The peewits wambling in the dark
163,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Lest in the dark the old man might
164,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Creep up to me to beg a light.
165,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
166,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But Wood Top grass is short and sweet
167,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And springy to a boxer’s feet;
168,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,At harvest hum the moon so bright
169,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Did shine on Wood Top for the fight.
170,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
171,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When Bill was stripped down to his bends
172,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I thought how long we two’d been friends,"
173,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And in my mind, about that wire,"
174,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I thought ’He’s right, I am a liar,"
175,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,As sure as skilly’s made in prison
176,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The right to poach that copse is his’n.
177,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ll have no luck to-night,’ thinks I."
178,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I’m fighting to defend a lie.
179,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
180,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And this moonshiny evening’s fun
181,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Is worse than aught I ever done.’
182,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And thinking that way my heart bled so
183,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I almost stept to Bill and said so.
184,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And now Bill’s dead I would be glad
185,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If I could only think I had.
186,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But no.  I put the thought away
187,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For fear of what my friends would say.
188,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They’d backed me, see?  O Lord, the sin"
189,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Done for the things there’s money in.
190,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
191,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The stakes were drove, the ropes were hitched,"
192,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Into the ring my hat I pitched.
193,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,My corner faced the Squire’s park
194,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Just where the fir-trees make it dark;
195,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The place where I begun poor Nell
196,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Upon the woman’s road to hell.
197,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I thought oft, sitting in my corner"
198,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,After the time-keep struck his warner
199,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"(Two brandy flasks, for fear of noise,"
200,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Clinked out the time to us two boys).
201,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And while my seconds chafed and gloved me
202,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I thought of Nell’s eyes when she loved me,"
203,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And wondered how my tot would end,"
204,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,First Nell cast off and now my friend;
205,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And in the moonlight dim and wan
206,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I knew quite well my luck was gone;
207,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And looking round I felt a spite
208,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,At all who’d come to see me fight;
209,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The five and forty human faces
210,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Inflamed by drink and going to races,"
211,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Faces of men who’d never been
212,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Merry or true or live or clean;
213,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who’d never felt the boxer’s trim
214,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Of brain divinely knit to limb,"
215,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Nor felt the whole live body go
216,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,One tingling health from top to toe;
217,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Nor took a punch nor given a swing,"
218,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But just soaked deady round the ring
219,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Until their brains and bloods were foul
220,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Enough to make their throttles howl,"
221,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,While we whom Jesus died to teach
222,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Fought round on round, three minutes each."
223,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
224,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And thinking that, you’ll understand"
225,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I thought, ’I’ll go and take Bill’s hand."
226,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ll up and say the fault was mine,"
227,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He sha’n’t make play for these here swine.’
228,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then I thought that that was silly,"
229,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They’d think I was afraid of Billy:
230,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They’d think (I thought it, God forgive me)"
231,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I funked the hiding Bill could give me.
232,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And that thought made me mad and hot.
233,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Think that, will they?  Well, they shall not."
234,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They sha’n’t think that.  I will not.  I’m
235,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Damned if I will.  I will not.’
236,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Time!
237,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
238,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From the beginning of the bout
239,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My luck was gone, my hand was out."
240,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Right from the start Bill called the play,"
241,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But I was quick and kept away
242,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Till the fourth round, when work got mixed,"
243,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And then I knew Bill had me fixed.
244,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My hand was out, why, Heaven knows;"
245,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Bill punched me when and where he chose.
246,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Through two more rounds we quartered wide
247,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all the time my hands seemed tied;
248,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Bill punched me when and where he pleased.
249,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The cheering from my backers ceased,"
250,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But every punch I heard a yell
251,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Of ’That’s the style, Bill, give him hell.’"
252,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"No one for me, but Jimmy’s light"
253,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Straight left!  Straight left!’ and ’Watch his right.’
254,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
255,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I don’t know how a boxer goes
256,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When all his body hums from blows;
257,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I know I seemed to rock and spin,"
258,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I don’t know how I saved my chin;
259,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I know I thought my only friend
260,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Was that clinked flask at each round’s end
261,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"When my two seconds, Ed and Jimmy,"
262,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Had sixty seconds help to gimme.
263,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But in the ninth, with pain and knocks"
264,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I stopped: I couldn’t fight nor box.
265,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Bill missed his swing, the light was tricky,"
266,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But I went down, and stayed down, dicky."
267,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Get up,’ cried Jim.  I said, ’I will.’"
268,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then all the gang yelled, ’Out him, Bill."
269,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Out him.’  Bill rushed ... and Clink, Clink, Clink."
270,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Time! and Jim’s knee, and rum to drink."
271,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And round the ring there ran a titter:
272,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Saved by the call, the bloody quitter.’"
273,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
274,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They drove (a dodge that never fails)
275,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A pin beneath my finger nails.
276,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They poured what seemed a running beck
277,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Of cold spring water down my neck;
278,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Jim with a lancet quick as flies
279,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Lowered the swellings round my eyes.
280,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They sluiced my legs and fanned my face
281,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Through all that blessed minute’s grace;
282,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They gave my calves a thorough kneading,"
283,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They salved my cuts and stopped the bleeding.
284,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A gulp of liquor dulled the pain,"
285,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And then the two flasks clinked again.
286,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Time!
287,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,There was Bill as grim as death.
288,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He rushed, I clinched, to get more breath."
289,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And breath I got, though Billy bats"
290,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Some stinging short-arms in my slats.
291,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
292,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And when we broke, as I foresaw,"
293,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He swung his right in for the jaw.
294,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I stopped it on my shoulder bone,"
295,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And at the shock I heard Bill groan--
296,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A little groan or moan or grunt
297,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,As though I’d hit his wind a bunt.
298,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At that, I clinched, and while we clinched,"
299,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His old-time right-arm dig was flinched,"
300,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And when we broke he hit me light
301,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"As though he didn’t trust his right,"
302,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He flapped me somehow with his wrist
303,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"As though he couldn’t use his fist,"
304,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And when he hit he winced with pain.
305,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I thought, ’Your sprained thumb’s crocked again.’"
306,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So I got strength and Bill gave ground,"
307,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And that round was an easy round.
308,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
309,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"During the wait my Jimmy said,"
310,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’What’s making Billy fight so dead?
311,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He’s all to pieces.  Is he blown?’
312,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’His thumb’s out.’
313,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’No?  Then it’s your own.
314,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It’s all your own, but don’t be rash--"
315,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He’s got the goods if you’ve got cash,"
316,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And what one hand can do he’ll do,"
317,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Be careful this next round or two.’
318,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
319,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Time!  There was Bill, and I felt sick"
320,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That luck should play so mean a trick
321,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And give me leave to knock him out
322,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,After he’d plainly won the bout.
323,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But by the way the man came at me
324,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He made it plain he meant to bat me;
325,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If you’d a seen the way he come
326,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You wouldn’t think he’d crocked a thumb.
327,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With all his skill and all his might
328,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He clipped me dizzy left and right;
329,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The Lord knows what the effort cost,"
330,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But he was mad to think he’d lost,"
331,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And knowing nothing else could save him
332,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He didn’t care what pain it gave him.
333,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He called the music and the dance
334,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For five rounds more and gave no chance.
335,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
336,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Try to imagine if you can
337,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The kind of manhood in the man,"
338,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And if you’d like to feel his pain,"
339,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You sprain your thumb and hit the sprain,"
340,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And hit it hard, with all your power"
341,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"On something hard for half-an-hour,"
342,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"While someone thumps you black and blue,"
343,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And then you’ll know what Billy knew.
344,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Bill took that pain without a sound
345,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Till half-way through the eighteenth round,"
346,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then I sent him down and out,"
347,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Silas said, ’Kane wins the bout.’"
348,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
349,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"When Bill came to, you understand,"
350,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I ripped the mitten from my hand
351,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And went across to ask Bill shake.
352,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My limbs were all one pain and ache,"
353,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I was so weary and so sore
354,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I don’t think I’d a stood much more.
355,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Bill in his corner bathed his thumb,"
356,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Buttoned his shirt and glowered glum.
357,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I’ll never shake your hand,’ he said."
358,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I’d rather see my children dead.
359,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ve been about and had some fun with you,"
360,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But you’re a liar and I’ve done with you.
361,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You’ve knocked me out, you didn’t beat me;"
362,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Look out the next time that you meet me,"
363,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,There’ll be no friend to watch the clock for you
364,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And no convenient thumb to crock for you,"
365,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And I’ll take care, with much delight,"
366,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You’ll get what you’d a got to-night;
367,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That puts my meaning clear, I guess,"
368,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Now get to hell; I want to dress.’
369,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
370,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I dressed.  My backers one and all
371,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Said, ’Well done you,’ or ’Good old Saul."
372,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Saul is a wonder and a fly ’un,"
373,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"What’ll you have, Saul, at the Lion?’"
374,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With merry oaths they helped me down
375,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The stony wood-path to the town.
376,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
377,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The moonlight shone on Cabbage Walk,"
378,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It made the limestone look like chalk,"
379,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It was too late for any people,"
380,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Twelve struck as we went by the steeple.
381,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A dog barked, and an owl was calling,"
382,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The Squire’s brook was still a-falling,"
383,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The carved heads on the church looked down
384,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"On ’Russell, Blacksmith of this Town,’"
385,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all the graves of all the ghosts
386,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who rise on Christmas Eve in hosts
387,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To dance and carol in festivity
388,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For joy of Jesus Christ’s Nativity
389,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,(Bell-ringer Dawe and his two sons
390,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Beheld ’em from the bell-tower once),"
391,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Two and two about about
392,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Singing the end of Advent out,"
393,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Dwindling down to windlestraws
394,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"When the glittering peacock craws,"
395,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,As craw the glittering peacock should
396,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When Christ’s own star comes over the wood.
397,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Lamb of the sky come out of fold
398,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Wandering windy heavens cold.
399,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,So they shone and sang till twelve
400,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When all the bells ring out of theirselve;
401,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Rang a peal for Christmas morn,"
402,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Glory, men, for Christ is born."
403,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
404,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,All the old monks’ singing places
405,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Glimmered quick with flitting faces,"
406,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Singing anthems, singing hymns"
407,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Under carven cherubims.
408,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Ringer Dawe aloft could mark
409,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Faces at the window dark
410,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Crowding, crowding, row on row,"
411,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Till all the church began to glow.
412,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The chapel glowed, the nave, the choir,"
413,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,All the faces became fire
414,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Below the eastern window high
415,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To see Christ’s star come up the sky.
416,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then they lifted hands and turned,"
417,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all their lifted fingers burned,"
418,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Burned like the golden altar tallows,"
419,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Burned like a troop of God’s own Hallows,"
420,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Bringing to mind the burning time
421,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When all the bells will rock and chime
422,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And burning saints on burning horses
423,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Will sweep the planets from their courses
424,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And loose the stars to burn up night.
425,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Lord, give us eyes to bear the light."
426,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
427,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,We all went quiet down the Scallenge
428,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Lest Police Inspector Drew should challenge.
429,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But ’Spector Drew was sleeping sweet,"
430,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His head upon a charges sheet,"
431,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Under the gas-jet flaring full,"
432,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Snorting and snoring like a bull,"
433,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His bull cheeks puffed, his bull lips blowing,"
434,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His ugly yellow front teeth showing.
435,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Just as we peeped we saw him fumble
436,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And scratch his head, and shift, and mumble."
437,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
438,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Down in the lane so thin and dark
439,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The tan-yards stank of bitter bark,"
440,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The curate’s pigeons gave a flutter,"
441,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A cat went courting down the gutter,"
442,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And none else stirred a foot or feather.
443,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The houses put their heads together,"
444,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Talking, perhaps, so dark and sly,"
445,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Of all the folk they’d seen go by,"
446,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Children, and men and women, merry all,"
447,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who’d some day pass that way to burial.
448,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It was all dark, but at the turning"
449,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The Lion had a window burning.
450,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So in we went and up the stairs,"
451,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Treading as still as cats and hares.
452,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
453,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The way the stairs creaked made you wonder
454,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If dead men’s bones were hidden under.
455,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,At head of stairs upon the landing
456,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A woman with a lamp was standing;
457,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She greet each gent at head of stairs
458,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With ’Step in, gents, and take your chairs."
459,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The punch’ll come when kettle bubble,"
460,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But don’t make noise or there’ll be trouble.’
461,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Twas Doxy Jane, a bouncing girl"
462,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With eyes all sparks and hair all curl,"
463,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And cheeks all red and lips all coal,"
464,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And thirst for men instead of soul.
465,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She’s trod her pathway to the fire.
466,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Old Rivers had his nephew by her.
467,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
468,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I step aside from Tom and Jimmy
469,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To find if she’d a kiss to gimme.
470,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I blew out lamp ’fore she could speak.
471,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She said, ’If you ain’t got a cheek,’"
472,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then beside me in the dim,"
473,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Did he beat you or you beat him?’
474,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Why, I beat him’ (though that was wrong)."
475,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She said, ’You must be turble strong."
476,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’d be afraid you’d beat me, too.’"
477,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’You’d not,’ I said, ’I wouldn’t do.’"
478,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Never?’
479,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’No, never.’"
480,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Never?’
481,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’No.’
482,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’O Saul.  Here’s missus.  Let me go.’
483,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It wasn’t missus, so I didn’t,"
484,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Whether I mid do or I midn’t,"
485,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Until she’d promised we should meet
486,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Next evening, six, at top of street,"
487,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When we could have a quiet talk
488,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,On that low wall up Worcester Walk.
489,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And while we whispered there together
490,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I give her silver for a feather
491,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And felt a drunkenness like wine
492,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And shut out Christ in husks and swine.
493,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I felt the dart strike through my liver.
494,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,God punish me for’t and forgive her.
495,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
496,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Each one could be a Jesus mild,"
497,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Each one has been a little child,"
498,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A little child with laughing look,"
499,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A lovely white unwritten book;
500,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A book that God will take, my friend,"
501,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,As each goes out at journey’s end.
502,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The Lord who gave us Earth and Heaven
503,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Takes that as thanks for all He’s given.
504,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The book he lent is given back
505,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,All blotted red and smutted black.
506,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
507,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Open the door,’ said Jim, ’and call.’"
508,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Jane gasped ’They’ll see me.  Loose me, Saul.’"
509,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She pushed me by, and ducked downstair"
510,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With half the pins out of her hair.
511,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I went inside the lit room rollin’
512,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Her scented handkerchief I’d stolen.
513,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’What would you fancy, Saul?’ they said."
514,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’A gin punch hot and then to bed.’
515,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Jane, fetch the punch bowl to the gemmen;"
516,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And mind you don’t put too much lemon.
517,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Our good friend Saul has had a fight of it,"
518,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Now smoke up, boys, and make a night of it.’"
519,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
520,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The room was full of men and stink
521,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Of bad cigars and heavy drink.
522,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Riley was nodding to the floor
523,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And gurgling as he wanted more.
524,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His mouth was wide, his face was pale,"
525,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His swollen face was sweating ale;
526,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And one of those assembled Greeks
527,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Had corked black crosses on his cheeks.
528,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Thomas was having words with Goss,"
529,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He ’wouldn’t pay, the fight was cross.’"
530,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Goss told Tom that ’cross or no,"
531,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The bets go as the verdicts go,"
532,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,By all I’ve ever heard or read of.
533,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So pay, or else I’ll knock your head off.’"
534,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Jim Gurvil said his smutty say
535,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,About a girl down Bye Street way.
536,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how the girl from Froggatt’s circus
537,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Died giving birth in Newent work’us.
538,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Dick told how the Dymock wench
539,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Bore twins, poor thing, on Dog Hill bench;"
540,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how he’d owned to one in court
541,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how Judge made him sorry for’t.
542,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Jock set a Jew’s harp twanging drily;
543,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Gimme another cup,’ said Riley."
544,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
545,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A dozen more were in their glories
546,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With laughs and smokes and smutty stories;
547,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Jimmy joked and took his sup
548,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And sang his song of ’Up, come up.’"
549,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Jane brought the bowl of stewing gin
550,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And poured the egg and lemon in,"
551,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And whisked it up and served it out
552,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,While bawdy questions went about.
553,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Jack chucked her chin, and Jim accost her"
554,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With bits out of the ’Maid of Gloster.’
555,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And fifteen arms went round her waist.
556,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"(And then men ask, Are Barmaids chaste?)"
557,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
558,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O young men, pray to be kept whole"
559,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From bringing down a weaker soul.
560,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Your minute’s joy so meet in doin’
561,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,May be the woman’s door to ruin;
562,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The door to wandering up and down,"
563,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A painted whore at half a crown.
564,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The bright mind fouled, the beauty gay"
565,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"All eaten out and fallen away,"
566,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,By drunken days and weary tramps
567,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"From pub to pub by city lamps,"
568,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Till men despise the game they started
569,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Till health and beauty are departed,"
570,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And in a slum the reeking hag
571,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Mumbles a crust with toothy jag,"
572,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or gets the river’s help to end
573,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The life too wrecked for man to mend.
574,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
575,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,We spat and smoked and took our swipe
576,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Till Silas up and tap his pipe,"
577,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And begged us all to pay attention
578,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Because he’d several things to mention.
579,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"We’d seen the fight (Hear, hear.  That’s you);"
580,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But still one task remained to do;
581,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That task was his, he didn’t shun it,"
582,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To give the purse to him as won it;
583,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With this remark, from start to out"
584,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He’d never seen a brisker bout.
585,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,There was the purse.  At that he’d leave it.
586,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Let Kane come forward to receive it.
587,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
588,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I took the purse and hemmed and bowed,"
589,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And called for gin punch for the crowd;
590,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And when the second bowl was done,"
591,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I called, ’Let’s have another one.’"
592,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Si’s wife come in and sipped and sipped
593,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,(As women will) till she was pipped.
594,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Si hit Dicky Twot a clouter
595,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Because he put his arm about her;
596,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But after Si got overtasked
597,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She sat and kissed whoever asked.
598,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My Doxy Jane was splashed by this,"
599,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I took her on my knee to kiss.
600,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Tom cried out, ’O damn the gin;"
601,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Why can’t we all have women in?
602,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Bess Evans, now, or Sister Polly,"
603,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or those two housemaids at the Folly?
604,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Let someone nip to Biddy Price’s,"
605,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They’d all come in a brace of trices.
606,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Rose Davies, Sue, and Betsy Perks;"
607,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"One man, one girl, and damn all Turks.’"
608,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But, no.  ’More gin,’ they cried; ’Come on."
609,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,We’ll have the girls in when it’s gone.’
610,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So round the gin went, hot and heady,"
611,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Hot Hollands punch on top of deady.
612,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
613,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Hot Hollands punch on top of stout
614,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Puts madness in and wisdom out.
615,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From drunken man to drunken man
616,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The drunken madness raged and ran.
617,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I’m climber Joe who climbed the spire.’
618,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You’re climber Joe the bloody liar.’
619,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Who says I lie?’
620,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I do.’
621,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’You lie,"
622,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I climbed the spire and had a fly.’
623,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I’m French Suzanne, the Circus Dancer,"
624,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’m going to dance a bloody Lancer.’
625,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’If I’d my rights I’m Squire’s heir.’
626,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’By rights I’d be a millionaire.’
627,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’By rights I’d be the lord of you,"
628,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But Farmer Scriggins had his do,"
629,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He done me, so I’ve had to hoove it,"
630,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ve got it all wrote down to prove it.
631,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And one of these dark winter nights
632,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He’ll learn I mean to have my rights;
633,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ll bloody him a bloody fix,"
634,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ll bloody burn his bloody ricks.’
635,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
636,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"From three long hours of gin and smokes,"
637,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And two girls’ breath and fifteen blokes’,"
638,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A warmish night, and windows shut,"
639,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The room stank like a fox’s gut.
640,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The heat and smell and drinking deep
641,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Began to stun the gang to sleep.
642,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Some fell downstairs to sleep on the mat,"
643,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Some snored it sodden where they sat.
644,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Dick Twot had lost a tooth and wept,"
645,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But all the drunken others slept.
646,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Jane slept beside me in the chair,"
647,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And I got up; I wanted air.
648,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
649,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I opened window wide and leaned
650,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Out of that pigstye of the fiend
651,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And felt a cool wind go like grace
652,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,About the sleeping market-place.
653,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The clock struck three, and sweetly, slowly,"
654,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The bells chimed Holy, Holy, Holy;"
655,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And in a second’s pause there fell
656,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The cold note of the chapel bell,"
657,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then a cock crew, flapping wings,"
658,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And summat made me think of things
659,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,How long those ticking clocks had gone
660,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"From church and chapel, on and on,"
661,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Ticking the time out, ticking slow"
662,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To men and girls who’d come and go,"
663,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how they ticked in belfry dark
664,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"When half the town was bishop’s park,"
665,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how they’d rung a chime full tilt
666,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The night after the church was built,"
667,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And how that night was Lambert’s Feast,"
668,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The night I’d fought and been a beast.
669,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how a change had come.  And then
670,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I thought, ’You tick to different men.’"
671,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,What with the fight and what with drinking
672,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And being awake alone there thinking,"
673,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My mind began to carp and tetter,"
674,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’If this life’s all, the beasts are better.’"
675,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then I thought, ’I wish I’d seen"
676,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The many towns this town has been;
677,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I wish I knew if they’d a-got
678,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A kind of summat we’ve a-not,"
679,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If them as built the church so fair
680,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Were half the chaps folk say they were;
681,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"For they’d the skill to draw their plan,"
682,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And skill’s a joy to any man;
683,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And they’d the strength, not skill alone,"
684,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To build it beautiful in stone;
685,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And strength and skill together thus...
686,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O, they were happier men than us."
687,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
688,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’But if they were, they had to die"
689,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The same as every one and I.
690,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And no one lives again, but dies,"
691,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all the bright goes out of eyes,"
692,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all the skill goes out of hands,"
693,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all the wise brain understands,"
694,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all the beauty, all the power"
695,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Is cut down like a withered flower.
696,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In all the show from birth to rest
697,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I give the poor dumb cattle best.’
698,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
699,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I wondered, then, why life should be,"
700,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And what would be the end of me
701,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When youth and health and strength were gone
702,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And cold old age came creeping on?
703,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A keeper’s gun?  The Union ward?
704,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or that new quod at Hereford?
705,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And looking round I felt disgust
706,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At all the nights of drink and lust,"
707,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all the looks of all the swine
708,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who’d said that they were friends of mine;
709,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And yet I knew, when morning came,"
710,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The morning would be just the same,"
711,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For I’d have drinks and Jane would meet me
712,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And drunken Silas Jones would greet me,"
713,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And I’d risk quod and keeper’s gun
714,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Till all the silly game was done.
715,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’For parson chaps are mad supposin’
716,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A chap can change the road he’s chosen.’
717,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then the Devil whispered ’Saul,"
718,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Why should you want to live at all?
719,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Why fret and sweat and try to mend?
720,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,It’s all the same thing in the end.
721,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But when it’s done,’ he said, ’it’s ended."
722,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Why stand it, since it can’t be mended?’"
723,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And in my heart I heard him plain,"
724,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Throw yourself down and end it, Kane.’"
725,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
726,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Why not?’ said I.  ’Why not?  But no.
727,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I won’t.  I’ve never had my go.
728,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ve not had all the world can give.
729,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Death by and by, but first I’ll live."
730,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The world owes me my time of times,"
731,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And that time’s coming now, by crimes.’"
732,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
733,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A madness took me then.  I felt
734,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’d like to hit the world a belt.
735,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I felt that I could fly through air,"
736,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A screaming star with blazing hair,"
737,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A rushing comet, crackling, numbing"
738,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The folk with fear of judgment coming,"
739,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A ’Lijah in a fiery car
740,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Coming to tell folk what they are.
741,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
742,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’That’s what I’ll do,’ I shouted loud,"
743,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I’ll tell this sanctimonious crowd,"
744,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"This town of window-peeping, prying,"
745,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Maligning, peering, hinting, lying,"
746,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Male and female human blots
747,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Who would, but daren’t be, whores and sots,"
748,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That they’re so steeped in petty vice
749,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That they’re less excellent than lice,"
750,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That they’re so soaked in petty virtue
751,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That touching one of them will dirt you,"
752,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Dirt you with the stain of mean
753,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Cheating trade and going between,"
754,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Pinching, starving, scraping, hoarding"
755,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Spying through the chinks of boarding
756,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To see if Sue the prentice lean
757,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Dares to touch the margarine.
758,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Fawning, cringing, oiling boots,"
759,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Raging in the crowd’s pursuits,"
760,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Flinging stones at all the Stephens,"
761,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Standing firm with all the evens,"
762,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Making hell for all the odd,"
763,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"All the lonely ones of God,"
764,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Those poor lonely ones who find
765,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Dogs more mild than human kind.
766,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"For dogs,’ I said, ’are nobles born"
767,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To most of you, you cockled corn."
768,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ve known dogs to leave their dinner,"
769,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Nosing a kind heart in a sinner.
770,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Poor old Crafty wagged his tail
771,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The day I first came home from jail,"
772,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"When all my folk, so primly clad,"
773,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Glowered black and thought me mad,"
774,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And muttered how they’d been respected,"
775,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,While I was what they’d all expected.
776,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"(I’ve thought of that old dog for years,"
777,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And of how near I come to tears.)
778,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
779,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’But you, you minds of bread and cheese,"
780,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Are less divine than that dog’s fleas.
781,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You suck blood from kindly friends,"
782,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And kill them when it serves your ends.
783,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Double traitors, double black,"
784,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Stabbing only in the back,"
785,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Stabbing with the knives you borrow
786,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From the friends you bring to sorrow.
787,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You stab all that’s true and strong;
788,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Truth and strength you say are wrong;
789,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Meek and mild, and sweet and creeping,"
790,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Repeating, canting, cadging, peeping,"
791,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That’s the art and that’s the life
792,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To win a man his neighbour’s wife.
793,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"All that’s good and all that’s true,"
794,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You kill that, so I’ll kill you.’"
795,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
796,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,At that I tore my clothes in shreds
797,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And hurled them on the window leads;
798,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I flung my boots through both the winders
799,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And knocked the glass to little flinders;
800,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The punch bowl and the tumblers followed,"
801,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And then I seized the lamps and holloed.
802,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And down the stairs, and tore back bolts,"
803,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,As mad as twenty blooded colts;
804,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And out into the street I pass,"
805,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"As mad as two-year-olds at grass,"
806,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A naked madman waving grand
807,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A blazing lamp in either hand.
808,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I yelled like twenty drunken sailors,"
809,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’The devil’s come among the tailors.’
810,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A blaze of flame behind me streamed,"
811,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And then I clashed the lamps and screamed
812,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I’m Satan, newly come from hell.’"
813,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And then I spied the fire-bell.
814,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
815,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ve been a ringer, so I know"
816,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,How best to make a big bell go.
817,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So on to bell-rope swift I swoop,"
818,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And stick my one foot in the loop
819,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And heave a down-swig till I groan,"
820,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Awake, you swine, you devil’s own.’"
821,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
822,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I made the fire-bell awake,"
823,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I felt the bell-rope throb and shake;
824,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I felt the air mingle and clang
825,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And beat the walls a muffled bang,"
826,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And stifle back and boom and bay
827,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Like muffled peals on Boxing Day,"
828,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then surge up and gather shape,"
829,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And spread great pinions and escape;
830,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And each great bird of clanging shrieks
831,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O Fire, Fire! from iron beaks."
832,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,My shoulders cracked to send around
833,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Those shrieking birds made out of sound
834,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With news of fire in their bills.
835,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,(They heard ’em plain beyond Wall Hills.)
836,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
837,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Up go the winders, out come heads,"
838,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I heard the springs go creak in beds;
839,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But still I heave and sweat and tire,"
840,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And still the clang goes ’Fire, Fire!’"
841,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Where is it, then?  Who is it, there?"
842,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You ringer, stop, and tell us where.’"
843,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Run round and let the Captain know.’
844,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’It must be bad, he’s ringing so.’"
845,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
846,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’It’s in the town, I see the flame;"
847,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Look there!  Look there, how red it came.’"
848,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Where is it, then ’O stop the bell.’"
849,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I stopped and called: ’It’s fire of hell;
850,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And this is Sodom and Gomorrah,"
851,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And now I’ll burn you up, begorra.’"
852,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
853,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"By this the firemen were mustering,"
854,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The half-dressed stable men were flustering,"
855,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Backing the horses out of stalls
856,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"While this man swears and that man bawls,"
857,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Don’t take th’old mare.  Back, Toby, back."
858,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Back, Lincoln.  Where’s the fire, Jack?’"
859,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Damned if I know.  Out Preston way.’
860,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’No.  It’s at Chancey’s Pitch, they say.’"
861,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’It’s sixteen ricks at Pauntley burnt.’
862,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’You back old Darby out, I durn’t.’"
863,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They ran the big red engine out,"
864,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And put ’em to with damn and shout.
865,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then they start to raise the shire,"
866,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Who brought the news, and where’s the fire?’"
867,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They’d moonlight, lamps, and gas to light ’em."
868,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I give a screech-owl’s screech to fright ’em,"
869,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And snatch from underneath their noses
870,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The nozzles of the fire hoses.
871,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I am the fire.  Back, stand back,"
872,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or else I’ll fetch your skulls a crack;
873,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,D’you see these copper nozzles here?
874,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They weigh ten pounds apiece, my dear;"
875,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’m fire of hell come up this minute
876,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To burn this town, and all that’s in it."
877,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To burn you dead and burn you clean,"
878,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You cogwheels in a stopped machine,"
879,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You hearts of snakes, and brains of pigeons,"
880,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You dead devout of dead religions,"
881,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You offspring of the hen and ass,"
882,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"By Pilate ruled, and Caiaphas."
883,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Now your account is totted.  Learn
884,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Hell’s flames are loose and you shall burn.’
885,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
886,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At that I leaped and screamed and ran,"
887,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I heard their cries go ’Catch him, man.’"
888,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Who was it?’  ’Down him.’  ’Out him, Ern."
889,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Duck him at pump, we’ll see who’ll burn.’"
890,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A policeman clutched, a fireman clutched,"
891,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A dozen others snatched and touched.
892,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’By God, he’s stripped down to his buff.’"
893,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’By God, we’ll make him warm enough.’"
894,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’After him.’  ’Catch him,’  ’Out him,’  ’Scrob him."
895,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’We’ll give him hell.’  ’By God, we’ll mob him.’"
896,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’We’ll duck him, scrout him, flog him, fratch him."
897,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’All right,’ I said.  ’But first you’ll catch him.’"
898,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
899,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The men who don’t know to the root
900,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The joy of being swift of foot,"
901,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Have never known divine and fresh
902,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The glory of the gift of flesh,"
903,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Nor felt the feet exult, nor gone"
904,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Along a dim road, on and on,"
905,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Knowing again the bursting glows,"
906,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The mating hare in April knows,"
907,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who tingles to the pads with mirth
908,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,At being the swiftest thing on earth.
909,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O, if you want to know delight,"
910,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Run naked in an autumn night,"
911,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And laugh, as I laughed then, to find"
912,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A running rabble drop behind,"
913,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And whang, on every door you pass,"
914,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Two copper nozzles, tipped with brass,"
915,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And doubly whang at every turning,"
916,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And yell, ’All hell’s let loose, and burning.’"
917,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
918,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I beat my brass and shouted fire
919,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At doors of parson, lawyer, squire,"
920,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,At all three doors I threshed and slammed
921,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And yelled aloud that they were damned.
922,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I clodded squire’s glass with turves
923,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Because he spring-gunned his preserves.
924,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Through parson’s glass my nozzle swishes
925,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Because he stood for loaves and fishes,"
926,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But parson’s glass I spared a tittle.
927,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He give me an orange once when little,"
928,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And he who gives a child a treat
929,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Makes joy-bells ring in Heaven’s street,"
930,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And he who gives a child a home
931,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Builds palaces in Kingdom come,"
932,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And she who gives a baby birth
933,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Brings Saviour Christ again to Earth,"
934,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"For life is joy, and mind is fruit,"
935,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And body’s precious earth and root.
936,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But lawyer’s glass--well, never mind,"
937,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Th’old Adam’s strong in me, I find."
938,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"God pardon man, and may God’s son"
939,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Forgive the evil things I’ve done.
940,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
941,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,What more?  By Dirty Lane I crept
942,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Back to the Lion, where I slept."
943,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The raging madness hot and floodin’
944,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Boiled itself out and left me sudden,"
945,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Left me worn out and sick and cold,"
946,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Aching as though I’d all grown old;
947,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So there I lay, and there they found me"
948,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"On door-mat, with a curtain round me."
949,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Si took my heels and Jane my head
950,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And laughed, and carried me to bed."
951,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And from the neighbouring street they reskied
952,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My boots and trousers, coat and weskit;"
953,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They bath-bricked both the nozzles bright
954,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To be mementoes of the night,"
955,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And knowing what I should awake with
956,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They flannelled me a quart to slake with,"
957,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And sat and shook till half-past two
958,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Expecting Police Inspector Drew.
959,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
960,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I woke and drank, and went to meat"
961,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In clothes still dirty from the street.
962,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Down in the bar I heard ’em tell
963,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"How someone rang the fire-bell,"
964,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And how th’inspector’s search had thriven,"
965,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how five pounds reward was given.
966,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Shepherd Boyce, of Marley, glad us"
967,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"By saying it was blokes from mad’us,"
968,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or two young rips lodged at the Prince
969,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Whom none had seen nor heard of since,"
970,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or that young blade from Worcester Walk
971,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,(You know how country people talk).
972,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
973,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Young Joe the ostler come in sad,"
974,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He said th’old mare had bit his dad.
975,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He said there’d come a blazing screeching
976,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Daft Bible-prophet chap a-preaching,"
977,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Had put th’old mare in such a taking
978,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She’d thought the bloody earth was quaking.
979,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And others come and spread a tale
980,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Of cut-throats out of Gloucester jail,"
981,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how we needed extra cops
982,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With all them Welsh come picking hops;
983,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With drunken Welsh in all our sheds
984,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,We might be murdered in our beds.
985,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"By all accounts, both men and wives"
986,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Had had the scare up of their lives.
987,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
988,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I ate and drank and gathered strength,"
989,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And stretched along the bench full length,"
990,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or crossed to window seat to pat
991,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Black Silas Jones’s little cat.
992,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At four I called, ’You devil’s own,"
993,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The second trumpet shall be blown.
994,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The second trump, the second blast;"
995,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Hell’s flames are loosed, and judgment’s passed."
996,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Too late for mercy now.  Take warning
997,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’m death and hell and Judgment morning.’
998,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I hurled the bench into the settle,"
999,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I banged the table on the kettle,"
1000,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I sent Joe’s quart of cider spinning.
1001,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Lo, here begins my second inning.’"
1002,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Each bottle, mug, and jug and pot"
1003,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I smashed to crocks in half a tot;
1004,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Joe, and Si, and Nick, and Percy"
1005,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I rolled together topsy versy.
1006,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And as I ran I heard ’em call,"
1007,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Now damn to hell, what’s gone with Saul?’"
1008,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1009,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Out into street I ran uproarious
1010,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The devil dancing in me glorious.
1011,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And as I ran I yell and shriek
1012,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Come on, now, turn the other cheek.’"
1013,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Across the way by almshouse pump
1014,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I see old puffing parson stump.
1015,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Old parson, red-eyed as a ferret"
1016,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From nightly wrestlings with the spirit;
1017,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I ran across, and barred his path."
1018,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His turkey gills went red as wrath
1019,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then he froze, as parsons can."
1020,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’The police will deal with you, my man.’"
1021,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Not yet,’ said I, ’not yet they won’t;"
1022,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And now you’ll hear me, like or don’t."
1023,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The English Church both is and was
1024,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A subsidy of Caiaphas.
1025,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I don’t believe in Prayer nor Bible,"
1026,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They’re lies all through, and you’re a libel,"
1027,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A libel on the Devil’s plan
1028,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When first he miscreated man.
1029,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You mumble through a formal code
1030,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To get which martyrs burned and glowed.
1031,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I look on martyrs as mistakes,"
1032,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But still they burned for it at stakes;
1033,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Your only fire’s the jolly fire
1034,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Where you can guzzle port with Squire,"
1035,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And back and praise his damned opinions
1036,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,About his temporal dominions.
1037,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You let him give the man who digs,"
1038,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A filthy hut unfit for pigs,"
1039,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Without a well, without a drain,"
1040,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With mossy thatch that lets in rain,"
1041,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Without a ’lotment, ’less he rent it,"
1042,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And never meat, unless he scent it,"
1043,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But weekly doles of ’leven shilling
1044,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To make a grown man strong and willing,"
1045,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To do the hardest work on earth
1046,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And feed his wife when she gives birth,"
1047,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And feed his little children’s bones.
1048,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I tell you, man, the Devil groans."
1049,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With all your main and all your might
1050,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You back what is against what’s right;
1051,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You let the Squire do things like these,"
1052,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You back him in’t and give him ease,"
1053,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You take his hand, and drink his wine,"
1054,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And he’s a hog, but you’re a swine."
1055,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For you take gold to teach God’s ways
1056,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And teach man how to sing God’s praise.
1057,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And now I’ll tell you what you teach
1058,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In downright honest English speech.
1059,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1060,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You teach the ground-down starving man
1061,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That Squire’s greed’s Jehovah’s plan.
1062,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You get his learning circumvented
1063,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Lest it should make him discontented
1064,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"(Better a brutal, starving nation"
1065,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Than men with thoughts above their station),"
1066,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You let him neither read nor think,"
1067,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You goad his wretched soul to drink
1068,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And then to jail, the drunken boor;"
1069,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,O sad intemperance of the poor.
1070,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You starve his soul till it’s rapscallion,"
1071,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Then blame his flesh for being stallion.
1072,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You send your wife around to paint
1073,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The golden glories of ""restraint."""
1074,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,How moral exercise bewild’rin’
1075,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Would soon result in fewer children.
1076,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You work a day in Squire’s fields
1077,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And see what sweet restraint it yields;
1078,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A woman’s day at turnip picking,"
1079,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Your heart’s too fat for plough or ricking.
1080,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1081,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’And you whom luck taught French and Greek
1082,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Have purple flaps on either cheek,"
1083,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A stately house, and time for knowledge,"
1084,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And gold to send your sons to college,"
1085,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That pleasant place, where getting learning"
1086,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Is also key to money earning.
1087,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But quite your damn’dest want of grace
1088,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Is what you do to save your face;
1089,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The way you sit astride the gates
1090,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,By padding wages out of rates;
1091,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Your Christmas gifts of shoddy blankets
1092,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That every working soul may thank its
1093,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Loving parson, loving squire"
1094,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Through whom he can’t afford a fire.
1095,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Your well-packed bench, your prison pen,"
1096,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To keep them something less than men;
1097,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Your friendly clubs to help ’em bury,"
1098,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Your charities of midwifery.
1099,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Your bidding children duck and cap
1100,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To them who give them workhouse pap.
1101,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O, what you are, and what you preach,"
1102,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And what you do, and what you teach"
1103,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Is not God’s Word, nor honest schism,"
1104,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But Devil’s cant and pauperism.’
1105,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1106,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,By this time many folk had gathered
1107,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To listen to me while I blathered;
1108,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I said my piece, and when I’d said it,"
1109,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ll do old purple parson credit,"
1110,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He sunk (as sometimes parsons can)
1111,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His coat’s excuses in the man.
1112,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You think that Squire and I are kings
1113,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Who made the existing state of things,"
1114,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And made it ill.  I answer, No,"
1115,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"States are not made, nor patched; they grow,"
1116,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Grow slow through centuries of pain
1117,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And grow correctly in the main,"
1118,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But only grow by certain laws
1119,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Of certain bits in certain jaws.
1120,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You want to doctor that.  Let be.
1121,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You cannot patch a growing tree.
1122,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Put these two words beneath your hat,"
1123,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,These two: securus judicat.
1124,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1125,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The social states of human kinds
1126,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Are made by multitudes of minds.
1127,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And after multitudes of years
1128,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A little human growth appears
1129,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Worth having, even to the soul"
1130,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who sees most plain it’s not the whole.
1131,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"This state is dull and evil, both,"
1132,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I keep it in the path of growth;
1133,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You think the Church an outworn fetter;
1134,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Kane, keep it, till you’ve built a better."
1135,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And keep the existing social state;
1136,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I quite agree it’s out of date,"
1137,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"One does too much, another shirks,"
1138,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Unjust, I grant; but still ... it works."
1139,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To get the whole world out of bed
1140,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And washed, and dressed, and warmed, and fed,"
1141,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To work, and back to bed again,"
1142,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Believe me, Saul, costs worlds of pain."
1143,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then, as to whether true or sham"
1144,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That book of Christ, Whose priest I am;"
1145,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The Bible is a lie, say you,"
1146,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Where do you stand, suppose it true?"
1147,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1148,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Good-bye.  But if you’ve more to say,"
1149,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,My doors are open night and day.
1150,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Meanwhile, my friend, ’twould be no sin"
1151,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To mix more water in your gin.
1152,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"We’re neither saints nor Philip Sidneys,"
1153,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But mortal men with mortal kidneys.’
1154,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He took his snuff, and wheezed a greeting,"
1155,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And waddled off to mothers’ meeting;
1156,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I hung my head upon my chest,"
1157,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I give old purple parson best.
1158,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For while the Plough tips round the Pole
1159,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The trained mind outs the upright soul,"
1160,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"As Jesus said the trained mind might,"
1161,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Being wiser than the sons of light,"
1162,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But trained men’s minds are spread so thin
1163,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They let all sorts of darkness in;
1164,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Whatever light man finds they doubt it,"
1165,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They love not light, but talk about it."
1166,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1167,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But parson’d proved to people’s eyes
1168,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That I was drunk, and he was wise;"
1169,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And people grinned and women tittered,"
1170,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And little children mocked and twittered
1171,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So blazing mad, I stalked to bar"
1172,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To show how noble drunkards are,"
1173,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And guzzled spirits like a beast,"
1174,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To show contempt for Church and priest,"
1175,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Until, by six, my wits went round"
1176,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Like hungry pigs in parish pound.
1177,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At half-past six, rememb’ring Jane,"
1178,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I staggered into street again
1179,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With mind made up (or primed with gin)
1180,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To bash the cop who’d run me in;
1181,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For well I knew I’d have to cock up
1182,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My legs that night inside the lock-up,"
1183,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And it was my most fixed intent
1184,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To have a fight before I went.
1185,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Our Fates are strange, and no one knows his;"
1186,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Our lovely Saviour Christ disposes.
1187,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1188,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Jane wasn’t where we’d planned, the jade."
1189,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She’d thought me drunk and hadn’t stayed.
1190,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,So I went up the Walk to look for her
1191,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And lingered by the little brook for her,"
1192,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And dowsed my face, and drank at spring,"
1193,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And watched two wild duck on the wing.
1194,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1195,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The moon come pale, the wind come cool,"
1196,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A big pike leapt in Lower Pool,"
1197,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The peacock screamed, the clouds were straking,"
1198,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,My cut cheek felt the weather breaking;
1199,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,An orange sunset waned and thinned
1200,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Foretelling rain and western wind,"
1201,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And while I watched I heard distinct
1202,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The metals on the railway clinked.
1203,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The blood-edged clouds were all in tatters,"
1204,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The sky and earth seemed mad as hatters;
1205,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They had a death look, wild and odd,"
1206,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Of something dark foretold by God.
1207,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And seeing it so, I felt so shaken"
1208,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I wouldn’t keep the road I’d taken,"
1209,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But wandered back towards the inn
1210,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Resolved to brace myself with gin.
1211,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And as I walked, I said, ’It’s strange,"
1212,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"There’s Death let loose to-night, and Change.’"
1213,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1214,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In Cabbage Walk I made a haul
1215,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Of two big pears from lawyer’s wall,"
1216,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And, munching one, I took the lane"
1217,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Back into Market-place again.
1218,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1219,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Lamp-lighter Dick had passed the turning
1220,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all the Homend lamps were burning,"
1221,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The windows shone, the shops were busy,"
1222,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But that strange Heaven made me dizzy.
1223,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The sky had all God’s warning writ
1224,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"In bloody marks all over it,"
1225,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And over all I thought there was
1226,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A ghastly light beside the gas.
1227,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The Devil’s tasks and Devil’s rages
1228,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Were giving me the Devil’s wages.
1229,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1230,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"In Market-place it’s always light,"
1231,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The big shop windows make it bright;
1232,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And in the press of people buying
1233,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I spied a little fellow crying
1234,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Because his mother’d gone inside
1235,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And left him there, and so he cried."
1236,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And mother’d beat him when she found him,"
1237,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And mother’s whip would curl right round him,"
1238,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And mother’d say he’d done’t to crost her,"
1239,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Though there being crowds about he’d lost her.
1240,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1241,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Lord, give to men who are old and rougher"
1242,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The things that little children suffer,"
1243,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And let keep bright and undefiled
1244,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The young years of the little child.
1245,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I pat his head at edge of street
1246,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And gi’m my second pear to eat.
1247,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Right under lamp, I pat his head,"
1248,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I’ll stay till mother come,’ I said,"
1249,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And stay I did, and joked and talked,"
1250,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And shoppers wondered as they walked.
1251,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’There’s that Saul Kane, the drunken blaggard,"
1252,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Talking to little Jimmy Jaggard.
1253,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The drunken blaggard reeks of drink.’
1254,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Whatever will his mother think?’
1255,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’Wherever has his mother gone?
1256,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Nip round to Mrs Jaggard’s, John,"
1257,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And say her Jimmy’s out again,"
1258,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"In Market-place, with boozer Kane.’"
1259,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’When he come out to-day he staggered.
1260,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O, Jimmy Jaggard, Jimmy Jaggard.’"
1261,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’His mother’s gone inside to bargain,"
1262,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Run in and tell her, Polly Margin,"
1263,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And tell her poacher Kane is tipsy
1264,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And selling Jimmy to a gipsy.’
1265,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1266,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Run in to Mrs Jaggard, Ellen,"
1267,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Or else, dear knows, there’ll be no tellin’,"
1268,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And don’t dare leave yer till you’ve fount her,"
1269,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You’ll find her at the linen counter.’
1270,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1271,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I told a tale, to Jim’s delight,"
1272,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Of where the tom-cats go by night,"
1273,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And how when moonlight come they went
1274,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Among the chimneys black and bent,"
1275,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"From roof to roof, from house to house,"
1276,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With little baskets full of mouse
1277,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"All red and white, both joint and chop"
1278,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Like meat out of a butcher’s shop;
1279,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Then all along the wall they creep
1280,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And everyone is fast asleep,"
1281,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And honey-hunting moths go by,"
1282,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And by the bread-batch crickets cry;
1283,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then on they hurry, never waiting"
1284,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To lawyer’s backyard cellar grating
1285,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Where Jaggard’s cat, with clever paw,"
1286,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Unhooks a broke-brick’s secret door;
1287,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then down into the cellar black,"
1288,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Across the wood slug’s slimy track,"
1289,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Into an old cask’s quiet hollow,"
1290,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Where they’ve got seats for what’s to follow;
1291,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then each tom-cat lights little candles,"
1292,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And O, the stories and the scandals,"
1293,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And O, the songs and Christmas carols,"
1294,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And O, the milk from little barrels."
1295,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They light a fire fit for roasting
1296,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"(And how good mouse-meat smells when toasting),"
1297,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Then down they sit to merry feast
1298,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,While moon goes west and sun comes east.
1299,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1300,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Sometimes they make so merry there
1301,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Old lawyer come to head of stair
1302,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To ’fend with fist and poker took firm
1303,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His parchments channelled by the bookworm,"
1304,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all his deeds, and all his packs"
1305,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Of withered ink and sealing wax;
1306,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And there he stands, with candle raised,"
1307,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And listens like a man amazed,"
1308,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Or like a ghost a man stands dumb at,"
1309,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He says, ’Hush!  Hush!  I’m sure there’s summat!’"
1310,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He hears outside the brown owl call,"
1311,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He hears the death-tick tap the wall,"
1312,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The gnawing of the wainscot mouse,"
1313,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The creaking up and down the house,"
1314,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The unhooked window’s hinges ranging,"
1315,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The sounds that say the wind is changing.
1316,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At last he turns, and shakes his head,"
1317,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’It’s nothing, I’ll go back to bed.’"
1318,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1319,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And just then Mrs Jaggard came
1320,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To view and end her Jimmy’s shame.
1321,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1322,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She made one rush and gi’m a bat
1323,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And shook him like a dog a rat.
1324,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’I can’t turn round but what you’re straying.
1325,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ll give you tales and gipsy playing.
1326,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ll give you wand’ring off like this
1327,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And listening to whatever ’t is,"
1328,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You’ll laugh the little side of the can,"
1329,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You’ll have the whip for this, my man;"
1330,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And not a bite of meat nor bread
1331,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,You’ll touch before you go to bed.
1332,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Some day you’ll break your mother’s heart,"
1333,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"After God knows she’s done her part,"
1334,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Working her arms off day and night
1335,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Trying to keep your collars white.
1336,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Look at your face, too, in the street."
1337,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,What dirty filth ’ve you found to eat?
1338,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Now don’t you blubber here, boy, or"
1339,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ll give you sum’t to blubber for.’
1340,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She snatched him off from where we stand
1341,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And knocked the pear-core from his hand,"
1342,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And looked at me, ’You Devil’s limb,"
1343,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,How dare you talk to Jaggard’s Jim;
1344,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"You drunken, poaching, boozing brute, you."
1345,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If Jaggard was a man he’d shoot you.’
1346,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She glared all this, but didn’t speak,"
1347,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She gasped, white hollows in her cheek;"
1348,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Jimmy was writhing, screaming wild,"
1349,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The shoppers thought I’d killed the child.
1350,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1351,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I had to speak, so I begun."
1352,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’You’d oughtn’t beat your little son;
1353,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He did no harm, but seeing him there"
1354,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I talked to him and gi’m a pear;
1355,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’m sure the poor child meant no wrong,"
1356,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It’s all my fault he stayed so long,"
1357,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He’d not have stayed, mum, I’ll be bound"
1358,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If I’d not chanced to come around.
1359,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It’s all my fault he stayed, not his."
1360,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I kept him here, that’s how it is.’"
1361,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Oh!  And how dare you, then?’ says she,"
1362,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’How dare you tempt my boy from me?
1363,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"How dare you do’t, you drunken swine,"
1364,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Is he your child or is he mine?
1365,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A drunken sot they’ve had the beak to,"
1366,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Has got his dirty whores to speak to,"
1367,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His dirty mates with whom he drink,"
1368,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Not little children, one would think."
1369,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Look on him, there,’ she says, ’look on him"
1370,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And smell the stinking gin upon him,"
1371,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The lowest sot, the drunk’nest liar,"
1372,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The dirtiest dog in all the shire:
1373,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Nice friends for any woman’s son
1374,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"After ten years, and all she’s done."
1375,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1376,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’For I’ve had eight, and buried five,"
1377,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And only three are left alive.
1378,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ve given them all we could afford,"
1379,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ve taught them all to fear the Lord.
1380,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They’ve had the best we had to give,"
1381,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The only three the Lord let live.
1382,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1383,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’For Minnie whom I loved the worst
1384,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Died mad in childbed with her first.
1385,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And John and Mary died of measles,"
1386,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Rob was drownded at the Teasels.
1387,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And little Nan, dear little sweet,"
1388,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A cart run over in the street;
1389,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Her little shift was all one stain,"
1390,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I prayed God put her out of pain.
1391,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all the rest are gone or going
1392,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The road to hell, and there’s no knowing"
1393,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For all I’ve done and all I’ve made them
1394,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’d better not have overlaid them.
1395,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For Susan went the ways of shame
1396,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The time the ’till’ry regiment came,"
1397,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And t’have her child without a father
1398,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I think I’d have her buried rather.
1399,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Dicky boozes, God forgimme,"
1400,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And now’t’s to be the same with Jimmy.
1401,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all I’ve done and all I’ve bore
1402,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Has made a drunkard and a whore,"
1403,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A bastard boy who wasn’t meant,"
1404,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Jimmy gwine where Dicky went;
1405,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For Dick began the self-same way
1406,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And my old hairs are going gray,"
1407,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And my poor man’s a withered knee,"
1408,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all the burden falls on me.
1409,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1410,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I’ve washed eight little children’s limbs,"
1411,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’ve taught eight little souls their hymns,"
1412,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ve risen sick and lain down pinched
1413,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And borne it all and never flinched;
1414,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But to see him, the town’s disgrace,"
1415,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With God’s commandments broke in’s face,"
1416,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Who never worked, not he, nor earned,"
1417,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Nor will do till the seas are burned,"
1418,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who never did since he was whole
1419,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A hand’s turn for a human soul,"
1420,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But poached and stole and gone with women,"
1421,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And swilled down gin enough to swim in;
1422,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To see him only lift one finger
1423,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To make my little Jimmy linger.
1424,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1425,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"In spite of all his mother’s prayers,"
1426,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all her ten long years of cares,"
1427,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all her broken spirit’s cry
1428,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That drunkard’s finger puts them by,"
1429,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Jimmy turns.  And now I see
1430,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That just as Dick was, Jim will be,"
1431,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all my life will have been vain.
1432,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I might have spared myself the pain,"
1433,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And done the world a blessed riddance
1434,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If I’d a drowned ’em all like kittens.
1435,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And he the sot, so strong and proud,"
1436,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Who’d make white shirts of’s mother’s shroud,"
1437,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He laughs now, it’s a joke to him,"
1438,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Though it’s the gates of hell to Jim.
1439,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1440,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’I’ve had my heart burnt out like coal,"
1441,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And drops of blood wrung from soul
1442,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Day in, day out, in pain and tears,"
1443,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For five and twenty wretched years;
1444,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And he, he’s ate the fat and sweet,"
1445,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And loafed and spat at top of street,"
1446,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And drunk and leched from day till morrow,"
1447,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And never known a moment’s sorrow.
1448,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1449,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He come out drunk from th’inn to look
1450,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The day my little Ann was took;
1451,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He sat there drinking, glad and gay,"
1452,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The night my girl was led astray;
1453,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He praised my Dick for singing well,"
1454,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The night Dick took the road to hell;
1455,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And when my corpse goes stiff and blind,"
1456,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Leaving four helpless souls behind,"
1457,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He will be there still, drunk and strong."
1458,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,It do seem hard.  It do seem wrong.
1459,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But ""Woe to him by whom the offence,"""
1460,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Says our Lord Jesus’ Testaments.
1461,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Whatever seems, God doth not slumber"
1462,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Though He lets pass times without number.
1463,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He’ll come with trump to call His own,"
1464,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And this world’s way’ll be overthrown.
1465,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,He’ll come with glory and with fire
1466,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To cast great darkness on the liar,"
1467,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To burn the drunkard and the treacher,"
1468,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And do His judgment on the lecher,"
1469,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To glorify the spirits’ faces
1470,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Of those whose ways were stony places,"
1471,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who chose with Ruth the better part;
1472,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O Lord, I see Thee as Thou art,"
1473,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O God, the fiery four-edged sword,"
1474,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The thunder of the wrath outpoured,"
1475,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The fiery four-faced creatures burning,"
1476,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And all the four-faced wheels all turning,"
1477,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Coming with trump and fiery saint.
1478,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Jim, take me home, I’m turning faint.’"
1479,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They went, and some cried, ’Good old sod."
1480,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’She put it to him straight, by God.’"
1481,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1482,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Summat she was, or looked, or said,"
1483,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Went home and made me hang my head.
1484,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I slunk away into the night
1485,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Knowing deep down that she was right.
1486,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’d often heard religious ranters,"
1487,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And put them down as windy canters,"
1488,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But this old mother made me see
1489,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The harm I done by being me,"
1490,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Being both strong and given to sin
1491,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I ’tracted weaker vessels in.
1492,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1493,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So back to bar to get more drink,"
1494,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I didn’t dare begin to think,"
1495,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And there were drinks and drunken singing,"
1496,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,As though this life were dice for flinging;
1497,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Dice to be flung, and nothing furder,"
1498,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Christ’s blood just another murder.
1499,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Come on, drinks round, salue, drink hearty."
1500,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Now, Jane, the punch-bowl for the party."
1501,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,If any here won’t drink with me
1502,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ll knock his bloody eyes out.  See?
1503,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Come on, cigars round, rum for mine,"
1504,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Sing us a smutty song, some swine.’"
1505,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But though the drinks and songs went round
1506,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That thought remained, it was not drowned."
1507,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And when I’d rise to get a light
1508,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I’d think, ’What’s come to me to-night?’"
1509,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1510,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,There’s always crowds when drinks are standing.
1511,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The house doors slammed along the landing,"
1512,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The rising wind was gusty yet,"
1513,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And those who came in late were wet;
1514,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all my body’s nerves were snappin’
1515,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With sense of summat ’bout to happen,"
1516,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And music seemed to come and go
1517,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And seven lights danced in a row.
1518,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1519,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"There used to be a custom then,"
1520,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Miss Bourne, the Friend, went round at ten"
1521,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To all the pubs in all the place
1522,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To bring the drunkard’s soul to grace;
1523,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Some sulked, of course, and some were stirred,"
1524,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But none gave her a dirty word.
1525,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A tall pale woman, grey and bent,"
1526,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Folk said of her that she was sent.
1527,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She wore Friend’s clothes, and women smiled,"
1528,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,But she’d a heart just like a child.
1529,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She come to us near closing time
1530,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"When we were at some smutty rhyme,"
1531,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And I was mad and ripe for fun;
1532,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I wouldn’t a minded what I done,"
1533,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,So when she come so prim and grey
1534,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I pound the bar and sing, ’Hooray,"
1535,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Here’s Quaker come to bless and kiss us,"
1536,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Come, have a gin and bitters, missus."
1537,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or may be Quaker girls so prim
1538,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Would rather start a bloody hymn.
1539,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Now, Dick, oblige.  A hymn, you swine,"
1540,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Pipe up the ""Officer of the Line,"""
1541,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A song to make one’s belly ache,"
1542,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Or ""Nell and Roger at the Wake,"""
1543,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Or that sweet song, the talk in town,"
1544,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"""The lady fair and Abel Brown."""
1545,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"""O, who’s that knocking at the door."""
1546,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Miss Bourne’ll play the music score.’
1547,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The men stood dumb as cattle are,"
1548,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"They grinned, but thought I’d gone too far,"
1549,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"There come a hush and no one break it,"
1550,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They wondered how Miss Bourne would take it.
1551,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She up to me with black eyes wide,"
1552,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She looked as though her spirit cried;
1553,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,She took my tumbler from the bar
1554,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Beside where all the matches are
1555,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And poured it out upon the floor dust,"
1556,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Among the fag-ends, spit and sawdust."
1557,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1558,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’Saul Kane,’ she said, ’when next you drink,"
1559,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Do me the gentleness to think
1560,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That every drop of drink accursed
1561,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Makes Christ within you die of thirst,"
1562,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That every dirty word you say
1563,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Is one more flint upon His way,"
1564,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Another thorn about His head,"
1565,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Another mock by where He tread,"
1566,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Another nail, another cross."
1567,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,All that you are is that Christ’s loss.’
1568,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The clock run down and struck a chime
1569,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Mrs Si said, ’Closing time.’"
1570,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1571,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The wet was pelting on the pane
1572,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And something broke inside my brain,"
1573,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I heard the rain drip from the gutters
1574,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Silas putting up the shutters,"
1575,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,While one by one the drinkers went;
1576,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I got a glimpse of what it meant,"
1577,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,How she and I had stood before
1578,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In some old town by some old door
1579,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Waiting intent while someone knocked
1580,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Before the door for ever locked;
1581,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She was so white that I was scared,"
1582,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A gas-jet, turned the wrong way, flared,"
1583,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And Silas snapped the bars in place.
1584,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Miss Bourne stood white and searched my face.
1585,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"When Silas done, with ends of tunes"
1586,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"He ’gan a-gathering the spittoons,"
1587,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His wife primmed lips and took the till.
1588,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Miss Bourne stood still and I stood still,"
1589,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And ’Tick.  Slow.  Tick.  Slow’ went the clock.
1590,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She said, ’He waits until you knock.’"
1591,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"She turned at that and went out swift,"
1592,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Si grinned and winked, his missus sniffed."
1593,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1594,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I heard her clang the Lion door,"
1595,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I marked a drink-drop roll to floor;
1596,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It took up scraps of sawdust, furry,"
1597,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And crinkled on, a half inch, blurry;"
1598,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A drop from my last glass of gin;
1599,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And someone waiting to come in,"
1600,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A hand upon the door latch gropin’
1601,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Knocking the man inside to open.
1602,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I know the very words I said,"
1603,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,They bayed like bloodhounds in my head.
1604,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,’The water’s going out to sea
1605,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And there’s a great moon calling me;
1606,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"But there’s a great sun calls the moon,"
1607,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all God’s bells will carol soon
1608,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,For joy and glory and delight
1609,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Of someone coming home to-night.’
1610,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1611,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Out into darkness, out to night,"
1612,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My flaring heart gave plenty light,"
1613,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,So wild it was there was no knowing
1614,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Whether the clouds or stars were blowing;
1615,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Blown chimney pots and folk blown blind
1616,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And puddles glimmering like my mind,"
1617,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And chinking glass from windows banging,"
1618,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And inn signs swung like people hanging,"
1619,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And in my heart the drink unpriced,"
1620,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The burning cataracts of Christ.
1621,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1622,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I did not think, I did not strive,"
1623,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The deep peace burnt my me alive;
1624,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The bolted door had broken in,"
1625,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I knew that I had done with sin.
1626,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I knew that Christ had given me birth
1627,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To brother all the souls on earth,"
1628,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And every bird and every beast
1629,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Should share the crumbs broke at the feast.
1630,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1631,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,O glory of the lighted mind.
1632,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"How dead I’d been, how dumb, how blind."
1633,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The station brook, to my new eyes,"
1634,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Was babbling out of Paradise;
1635,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The waters rushing from the rain
1636,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Were singing Christ has risen again.
1637,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I thought all earthly creatures knelt
1638,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,From rapture of the joy I felt.
1639,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The narrow station-wall’s brick ledge,"
1640,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The wild hop withering in the hedge,"
1641,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The lights in huntsman’s upper storey
1642,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Were parts of an eternal glory,"
1643,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Were God’s eternal garden flowers.
1644,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I stood in bliss at this for hours.
1645,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1646,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,O glory of the lighted soul.
1647,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The dawn came up on Bradlow Knoll,"
1648,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The dawn with glittering on the grasses,"
1649,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The dawn which pass and never passes.
1650,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1651,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"’It’s dawn,’ I said, ’and chimney’s smoking,"
1652,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all the blessed fields are soaking.
1653,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It’s dawn, and there’s an engine shunting;"
1654,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And hounds, for huntsman’s going hunting."
1655,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"It’s dawn, and I must wander north"
1656,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Along the road Christ led me forth.’
1657,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1658,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,So up the road I wander slow
1659,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Past where the snowdrops used to grow
1660,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With celandines in early springs,"
1661,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,When rainbows were triumphant things
1662,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And dew so bright and flowers so glad,"
1663,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Eternal joy to lass and lad.
1664,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And past the lovely brook I paced,"
1665,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The brook whose source I never traced,"
1666,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The brook, the one of two which rise"
1667,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"In my green dream in Paradise,"
1668,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In wells where heavenly buckets clink
1669,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To give God’s wandering thirsty drink
1670,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,By those clean cots of carven stone
1671,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Where the clear water sings alone.
1672,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then down, past that white-blossomed pond,"
1673,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And past the chestnut trees beyond,"
1674,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And past the bridge the fishers knew,"
1675,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Where yellow flag flowers once grew,"
1676,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Where we’d go gathering cops of clover,"
1677,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,In sunny June times long since over.
1678,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1679,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O clover-cops half white, half red,"
1680,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,O beauty from beyond the dead.
1681,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O blossom, key to earth and heaven,"
1682,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,O souls that Christ has new forgiven.
1683,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1684,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Then down the hill to gipsies’ pitch
1685,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,By where the brook clucks in the ditch.
1686,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A gipsy’s camp was in the copse,"
1687,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Three felted tents, with beehive tops,"
1688,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And round black marks where fires had been,"
1689,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And one old waggon painted green,"
1690,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And three ribbed horses wrenching grass,"
1691,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And three wild boys to watch me pass,"
1692,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And one old woman by the fire
1693,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Hulking a rabbit warm from wire.
1694,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I loved to see the horses bait.
1695,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I felt I walked at Heaven’s gate,"
1696,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,That Heaven’s gate was opened wide
1697,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Yet still the gipsies camped outside.
1698,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The waste souls will prefer the wild,"
1699,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Long after life is meek and mild.
1700,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Perhaps when man has entered in
1701,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His perfect city free from sin,"
1702,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The campers will come past the walls
1703,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"With old lame horses full of galls,"
1704,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And waggons hung about with withies,"
1705,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And burning coke in tinkers’ stithies,"
1706,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And see the golden town, and choose,"
1707,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And think the wild too good to lose.
1708,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And camp outside, as these camped then"
1709,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With wonder at the entering men.
1710,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"So past, and past the stone-heap white"
1711,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That dewberry trailers hid from sight,"
1712,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And down the field so full of springs,"
1713,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Where mewing peewits clap their wings,"
1714,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And past the trap made for the mill
1715,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Into the field below the hill.
1716,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"There was a mist along the stream,"
1717,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A wet mist, dim, like in a dream;"
1718,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I heard the heavy breath of cows,"
1719,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And waterdrops from th’alder boughs;
1720,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And eels, or snakes, in dripping grass"
1721,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Whipping aside to let me pass.
1722,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The gate was backed against the ryme
1723,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To pass the cows at milking time.
1724,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And by the gate as I went out
1725,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A moldwarp rooted earth wi ’s snout.
1726,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A few steps up the Callows’ Lane
1727,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Brought me above the mist again;
1728,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The two great fields arose like death
1729,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Above the mists of human breath.
1730,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1731,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,All earthly things that blessed morning
1732,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Were everlasting joy and warning.
1733,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The gate was Jesus’ way made plain,"
1734,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The mole was Satan foiled again,"
1735,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Black blinded Satan snouting way
1736,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Along the red of Adam’s clay;
1737,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The mist was error and damnation,"
1738,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The lane the road unto salvation,"
1739,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Out of the mist into the light;
1740,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,O blessed gift of inner sight.
1741,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The past was faded like a dream;
1742,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"There come the jingling of a team,"
1743,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"A ploughman’s voice, a clink of chain,"
1744,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Slow hoofs, and harness under strain."
1745,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Up the slow slope a team came bowing,"
1746,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Old Callow at his autumn ploughing,"
1747,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Old Callow, stooped above the hales."
1748,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Ploughing the stubble into wales;
1749,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"His grave eyes looking straight ahead,"
1750,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Shearing a long straight furrow red;
1751,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His plough-foot high to give it earth
1752,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To bring new food for men to birth.
1753,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1754,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O wet red swathe of earth laid bare,"
1755,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O truth, O strength, O gleaming share,"
1756,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O patient eyes that watch the goal,"
1757,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,O ploughman of the sinner’s soul.
1758,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O Jesus, drive the coulter deep"
1759,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To plough my living man from sleep.
1760,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1761,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Slow up the hill the plough team plod,"
1762,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Old Callow at the task of God,"
1763,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Helped by man’s wit, helped by the brute"
1764,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Turning a stubborn clay to fruit,"
1765,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His eyes for ever on some sign
1766,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To help him plough a perfect line.
1767,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"At top of rise the plough team stopped,"
1768,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The fore-horse bent his head and cropped
1769,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Then the chains chack, the brasses jingle,"
1770,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The lean reins gather through the cringle,"
1771,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The figures move against the sky,"
1772,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The clay wave breaks as they go by.
1773,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I kneeled there in the muddy fallow,"
1774,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I knew that Christ was there with Callow,"
1775,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That Christ was standing there with me,"
1776,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That Christ had taught me what to be,"
1777,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"That I should plough, and as I ploughed"
1778,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"My Saviour Christ would sing aloud,"
1779,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And as I drove the clods apart
1780,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Christ would be ploughing in my heart,"
1781,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Through rest-harrow and bitter roots,"
1782,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Through all my bad life’s rotten fruits.
1783,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1784,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O Christ who holds the open gate,"
1785,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O Christ who drives the furrow straight,"
1786,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O Christ, the plough, O Christ, the laughter"

1790,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The young green corn divinely springing,"
1791,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The young green corn for ever singing;
1792,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And when the field is fresh and fair
1793,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Thy blessed feet shall glitter there.
1794,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And we will walk the weeded field,"
1795,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And tell the golden harvest’s yield,"
1796,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The corn that makes the holy bread
1797,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"By which the soul of man is fed,"
1798,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The holy bread, the food unpriced,"

1804,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Thy hand on mine upon the hale.
1805,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1806,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Near Bullen Bank, on Gloucester Road,"
1807,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Thy everlasting mercy showed
1808,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The ploughman patient on the hill
1809,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"For ever there, for ever still,"
1810,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Ploughing the hill with steady yoke
1811,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Of pine-trees lightning-struck and broke.
1812,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I’ve marked the May Hill ploughman stay
1813,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"There on his hill, day after day"
1814,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Driving his team against the sky,"
1815,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,While men and women live and die.
1816,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1817,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And now and then he seems to stoop
1818,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To clear the coulter with the scoop,"
1819,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Or touch an ox to haw or gee
1820,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,While Severn stream goes out to sea.
1821,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The sea with all her ships and sails,"
1822,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And that great smoky port in Wales,"
1823,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And Gloucester tower bright i’ the sun,"
1824,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,All know that patient wandering one.
1825,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And sometimes when they burn the leaves
1826,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The bonfires’ smoking trails and heaves,"
1827,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And girt red flames twink and twire
1828,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,As though he ploughed the hill afire.
1829,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And in men’s hearts in many lands
1830,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A spiritual ploughman stands
1831,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"For ever waiting, waiting now,"
1832,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The heart’s ’Put in, man, zook the plough.’"
1833,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1834,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"By this the sun was all one glitter,"
1835,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The little birds were all in twitter;
1836,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Out of a tuft a little lark
1837,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Went higher up than I could mark,"
1838,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His little throat was all one thirst
1839,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"To sing until his heart should burst,"
1840,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,To sing aloft in golden light
1841,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,His song from blue air out of sight.
1842,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The mist drove by, and now the cows"
1843,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Came plodding up to milking house,"
1844,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Followed by Frank, the Callows’ cowman,"
1845,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Who whistled ’Adam was a ploughman.’
1846,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"There come such cawing from the rooks,"
1847,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Such running chuck from little brooks,"
1848,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"One thought it March, just budding green"
1849,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,With hedgerows full of celandine.
1850,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"An otter out of stream and played,"
1851,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Two hares come loping up and stayed;
1852,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Wide-eyed and tender-eared but bold.
1853,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Sheep bleated up by Penny’s fold.
1854,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I heard a partridge covey call;
1855,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The morning sun was bright on all.
1856,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1857,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Down the long slope the plough team drove
1858,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The tossing rooks arose and hove.
1859,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,A stone struck on the share.  A word
1860,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Came to the team.  The red earth stirred.
1861,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I crossed the hedge by shooter’s gap,"
1862,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"I hitched my boxer’s belt a strap,"
1863,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I jumped the ditch and crossed the fallow
1864,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,I took the hales from farmer Callow.

1866,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"How swift the summer goes,"

1869,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And now the hay is carted,"
1870,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"And now my song is ended,"
1871,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And all the summer spended;
1872,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,The blackbird’s second brood
1873,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Routs beech-leaves in the wood
1874,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The pink and rose have speeded,"
1875,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,Forget-me-not has seeded.
1876,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"Only the winds that blew,"
1877,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The rain that makes things new,"
1878,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"The earth that hides things old,"
1879,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,And blessings manifold.
1880,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,
1881,THE EVERLASTING MERCY,"O lovely lily clean,"
