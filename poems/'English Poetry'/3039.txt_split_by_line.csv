61,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"I who am dead a thousand years,"
62,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"And wrote this sweet archaic song,"
63,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,Send you my words for messengers
64,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,The way I shall not pass along.
65,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,
66,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"I care not if you bridge the seas,"
67,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"Or ride secure the cruel sky,"
68,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,Or build consummate palaces
69,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,Of metal or of masonry.
70,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,
71,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"But have you wine and music still,"
72,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"And statues and a bright-eyed love,"
73,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"And foolish thoughts of good and ill,"
74,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,And prayers to them who sit above?
75,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,
76,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,How shall we conquer?  Like a wind
77,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"That falls at eve our fancies blow,"
78,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,And old Moeonides the blind
79,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,Said it three thousand years ago.
80,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,
81,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"O friend unseen, unborn, unknown,"
82,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"Student of our sweet English tongue,"
83,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"Read out my words at night, alone:"
84,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"I was a poet, I was young."
85,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,
86,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"Since I can never see your face,"
87,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,"And never shake you by the hand,"
88,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,I send my soul through time and space
89,A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE,To greet you.  You will understand.

110,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,
111,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,
112,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,
113,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,There lies afar behind a western hill
114,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"The Town without a Market, white and still;"
115,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,For six feet long and not a third as high
116,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Are those small habitations.  There stood I,"
117,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,Waiting to hear the citizens beneath
118,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,Murmur and sigh and speak through tongueless teeth.
119,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,When all the world lay burning in the sun
120,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,I heard their voices speak to me.  Said one:
121,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"""Bright lights I loved and colours, I who find"
122,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"That death is darkness, and has struck me blind."""
123,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Another cried:  ""I used to sing and play,"
124,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"But here the world is silent, day by day."""
125,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"And one:  ""On earth I could not see or hear,"
126,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"But with my fingers touched what I was near,"
127,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"And knew things round and soft, and brass from gold,"
128,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"And dipped my hand in water, to feel cold,"
129,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"And thought the grave would cure me, and was glad"
130,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"When the time came to lose what joy I had."""
131,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,Soon all the voices of a hundred dead
132,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Shouted in wrath together.  Someone said,"
133,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"""I care not, but the girl was sweet to kiss"
134,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"At evening in the meadows.""  ""Hard it is"""
135,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Another cried, ""to hear no hunting horn."
136,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Ah me! the horse, the hounds, and the great grey morn"
137,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"When I rode out a-hunting.""  And one sighed,"
138,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"""I did not see my son before I died."""
139,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"A boy said, ""I was strong and swift to run:"
140,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Now they have tied my feet:  what have I done?"""
141,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"A man, ""But it was good to arm and fight"
142,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"And storm their cities in the dead of night."""
143,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"An old man said, ""I read my books all day,"
144,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"But death has taken all my books away."""
145,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"And one, ""The popes and prophets did not well"
146,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,To cheat poor dead men with false hopes of hell.
147,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,Better the whips of fire that hiss and rend
148,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Than painless void proceeding to no end."""
149,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"I smiled to hear them restless, I who sought"
150,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Peace.  For I had not loved, I had not fought,"
151,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"And books are vanities, and manly strength"
152,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,A gathered flower.  God grant us peace at length!
153,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"I heard no more, and turned to leave their town"
154,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Before the chill came, and the sun went down."
155,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Then rose a whisper, and I seemed to know"
156,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"A timorous man, buried long years ago."
157,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"""On Earth I used to shape the Thing that seems."
158,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Master of all men, give me back my dreams."
159,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Give me that world that never failed me then,"
160,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"The hills I made and peopled with tall men,"
161,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"The palace that I built and called my home,"
162,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"My cities which could break the pride of Rome,"
163,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"The three queens hidden in the sacred tree,"
164,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,And those white cloudy folk who sang to me.
165,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"O death, why hast thou covered me so deep?"
166,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"I was thy sister's child, the friend of Sleep."""
167,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,
168,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,"Then said my heart, Death takes and cannot give."
169,THE TOWN WITHOUT A MARKET,Dark with no dream is hateful:  let me live!

174,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
175,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
176,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
177,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,I walked with Maisie long years back
178,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"The streets of Camden Town,"
179,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"I splendid in my suit of black,"
180,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,And she divine in brown.
181,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
182,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"Hers was a proud and noble face,"
183,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"A secret heart, and eyes"
184,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,Like water in a lonely place
185,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,Beneath unclouded skies.
186,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
187,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"A bed, a chest, a faded mat,"
188,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"And broken chairs a few,"
189,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,Were all we had to grace our flat
190,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,In Hazel Avenue.
191,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
192,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"But I could walk to Hampstead Heath,"
193,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"And crown her head with daisies,"
194,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"And watch the streaming world beneath,"
195,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,And men with other Maisies.
196,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
197,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,When I was ill and she was pale
198,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"And empty stood our store,"
199,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"She left the latchkey on its nail,"
200,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,And saw me nevermore.
201,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
202,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,Perhaps she cast herself away
203,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,Lest both of us should drown:
204,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"Perhaps she feared to die, as they"
205,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,Who die in Camden Town.
206,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
207,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,What came of her?  The bitter nights
208,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"Destroy the rose and lily,"
209,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,And souls are lost among the lights
210,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,Of painted Piccadilly.
211,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
212,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,What came of her?  The river flows
213,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"So deep and wide and stilly,"
214,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,And waits to catch the fallen rose
215,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,And clasp the broken lily.
216,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
217,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,I dream she dwells in London still
218,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"And breathes the evening air,"
219,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"And often walk to Primrose Hill,"
220,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,And hope to meet her there.
221,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,
222,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"Once more together we will live,"
223,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,For I will find her yet:
224,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,I have so little to forgive;
225,THE BALLAD OF CAMDEN TOWN,"So much, I can't forget."

237,MIGNON,Knowest thou the land?  So far and fair!

247,MIGNON,Knowest thou the mountain with its bridge of cloud?
248,MIGNON,The mule plods warily:  the white mists crowd.
249,MIGNON,Coiled in their caves the brood of dragons sleep;
250,MIGNON,The torrent hurls the rock from steep to steep.
251,MIGNON,Knowest thou the land?  So far and fair.

260,FELO DE SE,The song of a man who was dead
261,FELO DE SE,"Ere any had heard of his song,"
262,FELO DE SE,"Or had seen this his ultimate song,"
263,FELO DE SE,"With the lines of it written in red,"
264,FELO DE SE,And the sound of it steady and strong.
265,FELO DE SE,"When you hear it, you know I am dead."
266,FELO DE SE,
267,FELO DE SE,Not because I was weary of life
268,FELO DE SE,As pallid poets are:
269,FELO DE SE,"My star was a conquering star,"
270,FELO DE SE,My element strife.
271,FELO DE SE,"I am young, I am strong, I am brave,"
272,FELO DE SE,It is therefore I go to the grave.
273,FELO DE SE,
274,FELO DE SE,"Now to life and to life's desire,"
275,FELO DE SE,"And to youth and the glory of youth,"
276,FELO DE SE,"Farewell, for I go to acquire,"
277,FELO DE SE,"By the one road left me, Truth."
278,FELO DE SE,Though a great God slay me with fire
279,FELO DE SE,I will shout till he answer me.  Why?
280,FELO DE SE,"(One soul and a Universe, why?)"
281,FELO DE SE,And for this it is pleasant to die.
282,FELO DE SE,
283,FELO DE SE,"For years and years I have slumbered,"
284,FELO DE SE,"And slumber was heavy and sweet,"
285,FELO DE SE,But the last few moments are numbered
286,FELO DE SE,Like trampling feet that beat.
287,FELO DE SE,"I shall walk with the stars in their courses,"
288,FELO DE SE,"And hear very soon, very soon,"
289,FELO DE SE,"The voice of the forge of the Forces,"
290,FELO DE SE,"And ride on a ridge of the moon,"
291,FELO DE SE,And sing a celestial tune.

966,OXFORD CANAL,"Of its red motors and lumbering trains, and self-sufficient people,"

968,OXFORD CANAL,Half town and half country--the land of the Canal.
969,OXFORD CANAL,It is dearer to me than the antique town:  I love it more than the

971,OXFORD CANAL,"Straightest, sublimest of rivers is the long Canal."
972,OXFORD CANAL,I have observed great storms and trembled:  I have wept for fear of the

982,OXFORD CANAL,He would rush through the water toward me till his image was scattered by
983,OXFORD CANAL,"his splash,"
984,OXFORD CANAL,When suddenly a train rushed by:  the brazen dome of the engine flashed:
985,OXFORD CANAL,the long white carriages roared;
986,OXFORD CANAL,"The sun veiled himself for a moment, and the signals loomed in fog;"
987,OXFORD CANAL,A savage woman screamed at me from a barge:  little children began to
988,OXFORD CANAL,cry;
989,OXFORD CANAL,The untidy landscape rose to life:  a sawmill started;
990,OXFORD CANAL,"A cart rattled down to the wharf, and workmen clanged over the iron"

1690,PAVLOVNA IN LONDON,A tall dark woman in a scarlet gown -

1703,PAVLOVNA IN LONDON,Follows among those unbelieved-in trees
1704,PAVLOVNA IN LONDON,Back-shadowing in their parody of light
1705,PAVLOVNA IN LONDON,Across the little cardboard balustrade;
