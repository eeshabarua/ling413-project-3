14,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,This etext contains only characters from the Latin-1 set. The original
15,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,work contained a few phrases of Greek text. These are represented here
16,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"as Beta-code transliterations in brackets, e.g. [Greek: misêto\n]."
17,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
18,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,The original text used a few other characters not found in the Latin-1
19,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"set. These have been represented using bracket notation, as follows:"
20,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"[=a], [=i] for letters with a macron, and ['c] for c with accent. In a"
21,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"few places superscript letters are shown by carets, as in Oct^r. 11."
22,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
23,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
24,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"indexed with letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) show variant forms of Byron's text"
25,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,from manuscripts and other sources. Footnotes indexed with arabic
26,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"numbers (e.g. [17], [221]) are informational. Text in notes and"
27,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,elsewhere in square brackets is the work of Editor E. H. Coleridge. Note
28,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,text not in brackets is by Byron himself.
29,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
30,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"In the original, footnotes are printed at the foot of the page on which"
31,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"they are referenced, and their indices start over on each page. In this"
32,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"etext, footnotes have been collected at the end of each section, and"
33,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,have been numbered consecutively throughout the book. Within each block
34,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"of footnotes are numbers in braces, e.g. {321}. These represent the page"
35,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,number on which the following notes originally appeared. To find a note
36,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"that was originally printed on page 27, search for {27}."

77,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.
78,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
79,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
80,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,The present volume contains the six metrical tales which were composed
81,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"within the years 1812 and 1815, the _Hebrew Melodies_, and the minor"
82,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,poems of 1809-1816. With the exception of the first fifteen poems
83,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"(1809-1811)--_Chansons de Voyage_, as they might be called--the volume"
84,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,as a whole was produced on English soil. Beginning with the _Giaour_;
85,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"which followed in the wake of _Childe Harold_ and shared its triumph,"
86,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"and ending with the ill-omened _Domestic Pieces_, or _Poems of the"
87,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Separation_, the poems which Byron wrote in his own country synchronize"
88,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,with his popularity as a poet by the acclaim and suffrages of his own
89,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"countrymen. His greatest work, by which his lasting fame has been"
90,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"established, and by which his relative merits as a great poet will be"
91,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"judged in the future, was yet to come; but the work which made his name,"
92,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"which is stamped with his sign-manual, and which has come to be regarded"
93,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"as distinctively and characteristically Byronic, preceded maturity and"
94,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,achievement.
95,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
96,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"No poet of his own or other times, not Walter Scott, not Tennyson, not"
97,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Mr. Kipling, was ever in his own lifetime so widely, so amazingly"
98,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"popular. Thousands of copies of the ""Tales""--of the _Bride of Abydos_,"
99,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"of the _Corsair_, of _Lara_--were sold in a day, and edition followed"
100,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"edition month in and month out. Everywhere men talked about the ""noble"
101,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"author""--in the capitals of Europe, in literary circles in the United"
102,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"States, in the East Indies. He was ""the glass of fashion ... the"
103,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"observ'd of all observers,"" the swayer of sentiment, the master and"
104,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,creator of popular emotion. No other English poet before or since has
105,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"divided men's attention with generals and sea-captains and statesmen,"
106,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,has attracted and fascinated and overcome the world so entirely and
107,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,potently as Lord Byron.
108,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
109,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"It was _Childe Harold_, the unfinished, immature _Childe Harold_, and"
110,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"the Turkish and other ""Tales,"" which raised this sudden and deafening"
111,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"storm of applause when the century was young, and now, at its close (I"
112,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"refer, of course, to the Tales, not to Byron's poetry as a whole, which,"
113,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"in spite of the critics, has held and still holds its own), are ignored"
114,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"if not forgotten, passed over if not despised--which but few know"
115,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"thoroughly, and ""very few"" are found to admire or to love. _Ubi lapsus,"
116,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,quid feci?_ might the questioning spirit of the author exclaim with
117,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"regard to his ""Harrys and Larrys, Pilgrims and Pirates,"" who once held"
118,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"the field, and now seem to have gone under in the struggle for poetical"
119,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,existence!
120,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
121,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"To what, then, may we attribute the passing away of interest and"
122,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"enthusiasm? To the caprice of fashion, to an insistence on a more"
123,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"faultless _technique_, to a nicer taste in ethical sentiment, to a"
124,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"preference for a subtler treatment of loftier themes? More certainly,"
125,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"and more particularly, I think, to the blurring of outline and the"
126,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,blotting out of detail due to lapse of time and the shifting of the
127,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,intellectual standpoint.
128,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
129,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,However much the charm of novelty and the contagion of enthusiasm may
130,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"have contributed to the success of the Turkish and other Tales, it is in"
131,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,the last degree improbable that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers
132,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"were enamoured, not of a reality, but of an illusion born of ignorance"
133,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,or of vulgar bewilderment. They were carried away because they breathed
134,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"the same atmosphere as the singer; and being undistracted by ethical, or"
135,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"grammatical, or metrical offences, they not only read these poems with"
136,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"avidity, but understood enough of what they read to be touched by their"
137,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"vitality, to realize their verisimilitude."
138,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
139,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"_Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner._ Nay, more, the knowledge, the"
140,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"comprehension of essential greatness in art, in nature, or in man is not"
141,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,to know that there is aught to forgive. But that sufficing knowledge
142,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,which the reader of average intelligence brings with him for the
143,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,comprehension and appreciation of contemporary literature has to be
144,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,bought at the price of close attention and patient study when the
145,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,subject-matter of a poem and the modes and movements of the poet's
146,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,consciousness are alike unfamiliar.
147,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
148,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Criticism, however subtle, however suggestive, however luminous, will"
149,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"not bridge over the gap between the past and the present, will not"
150,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"supply the sufficing knowledge. It is delightful and interesting and, in"
151,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"a measure, instructive to know what great poets of his own time and of"
152,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"ours have thought of Byron, how he ""strikes"" them; but unless we are"
153,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"ourselves saturated with his thought and style, unless we learn to"
154,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"breathe his atmosphere by reading the books which he read, picturing to"
155,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"ourselves the scenes which he saw,--unless we aspire to his ideals and"
156,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"suffer his limitations, we are in no way entitled to judge his poems,"
157,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,whether they be good or bad.
158,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
159,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Byron's metrical ""Tales"" come before us in the guise of light reading,"
160,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"and may be ""easily criticized"" as melo-dramatic--the heroines"
161,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"conventional puppets, the heroes reduplicated reflections of the"
162,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"author's personality, the Oriental ""properties"" loosely arranged, and"
163,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,somewhat stage-worn. A thorough and sympathetic study of these once
164,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"extravagantly lauded and now belittled poems will not, perhaps, reverse"
165,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"the deliberate judgment of later generations, but it will display them"
166,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"for what they are, bold and rapid and yet exact presentations of the"
167,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"""gorgeous East,"" vivid and fresh from the hand of the great artist who"
168,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"conceived them out of the abundance of memory and observation, and"
169,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"wrought them into shape with the ""pen of a ready writer."" They will be"
170,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"once more recognized as works of genius, an integral portion of our"
171,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"literary inheritance, which has its proper value, and will repay a more"
172,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,assiduous and a finer husbandry.
173,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
174,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,I have once more to acknowledge the generous assistance of the officials
175,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"of the British Museum, and, more especially, of Mr. A. G. Ellis, of the"
176,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Oriental Printed Books and MSS. Department, who has afforded me"
177,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,invaluable instruction in the compilation of the notes to the _Giaour_
178,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,and _Bride of Abydos_.
179,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
180,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"I have also to thank Mr. R. L. Binyon, of the Department of Prints and"
181,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Drawings, for advice and assistance in the selection of illustrations."
182,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
183,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,I desire to express my cordial thanks to the Registrar of the Copyright
184,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Office, Stationers' Hall; to Professor Jannaris, of the University of"
185,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"St. Andrews; to Miss E. Dawes, M.A., D.L., of Heathfield Lodge,"
186,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Weybridge; to my cousin, Miss Edith Coleridge, of Goodrest, Torquay; and"
187,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"to my friend, Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey, for information kindly"
188,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,supplied during the progress of the work.
189,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,
190,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"For many of the ""parallel passages"" from the works of other poets, which"
191,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"are to be found in the notes, I am indebted to a series of articles by"
192,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"A. A. Watts, in the _Literary Gazette,_ February and March, 1821; and to"
193,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,the notes to the late Professor E. Kolbing's _Siege of Corinth._

195,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"On behalf of the publisher, I beg to acknowledge the kindness of Lord"
196,PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.,"Glenesk, and of Sir Theodore Martin, K.C.B., who have permitted the"

3789,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"an edition of 28 pages containing 460 lines, itself an enlargement on"
3790,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,the MS.; but whether (as a note in the handwriting of the late Mr.
3791,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,Murray affirms) this was or was not published is uncertain. A portion of
3792,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"a second proof of 38 pages has been preserved, but of the publication of"
3793,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,the poem in this state there is no record. On June 5 a first edition of
3794,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"41 pages, containing 685 lines, was issued, and of this numerous copies"
3795,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"are extant. At the end of June, or the beginning of July, 1813, a second"
3796,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"edition, entitled, a ""New Edition with some Additions,"" appeared. This"
3797,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"consisted of 47 pages, and numbered 816 lines. Among the accretions is"
3798,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"to be found the famous passage beginning, ""He that hath bent him o'er"
3799,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"the dead."" Two MS. copies of this _pannus vere purpureus_ are in Mr."
3800,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"Murray's possession. At the end of July, and during the first half of"
3801,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"August, two or more issues of a third edition were set up in type. The"
3802,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"first issue amounted to 53 pages, containing 950 lines, was certainly"
3803,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"published in this form, and possibly a second issue of 56 pages,"
3804,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"containing 1004 lines, may have followed at a brief interval. A revise"
3805,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"of this second issue, dated August 13, is extant. In the last fortnight"
3806,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"of August a fourth edition of 58 pages, containing 1048 lines,"
3807,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,undoubtedly saw the light. Scarcely more than a few days can have
3808,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"elapsed before a fifth edition of 66 pages, containing 1215 lines, was"
3809,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"ready to supplant the fourth edition. A sixth edition, a reproduction of"
3810,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"the fifth, may have appeared in October. A seventh edition of 75 pages,"
3811,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"containing 1334 lines, which presented the poem in its final shape, was"
3812,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"issued subsequently to November 27, 1813 (a seventh edition was"
3813,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"advertised in the _Morning Chronicle_, December 22, 1813), the date of"
3814,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"the last revise, or of an advance copy of the issue. The ninth, tenth,"
3815,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,"eleventh, and twelfth editions belong to 1814, while a fourteenth"
3816,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,edition is known to have been issued in 1815. In that year and
3817,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,henceforward the _Giaour_ was included in the various collected editions
3818,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON _THE GIAOUR_,of Byron's works. The subjoined table assigns to their several editions

4282,THE GIAOUR.,That sound had harmonized his rest;
4283,THE GIAOUR.,And oft had Hassan's Youth along

4431,THE GIAOUR.,When Leila dwelt in his Serai.
4432,THE GIAOUR.,Doth Leila there no longer dwell?
4433,THE GIAOUR.,That tale can only Hassan tell:
4434,THE GIAOUR.,Strange rumours in our city say
4435,THE GIAOUR.,Upon that eve she fled away
4436,THE GIAOUR.,"When Rhamazan's[84] last sun was set,"

4439,THE GIAOUR.,Of Bairam through the boundless East.
4440,THE GIAOUR.,"'Twas then she went as to the bath,"
4441,THE GIAOUR.,Which Hassan vainly searched in wrath;
4442,THE GIAOUR.,For she was flown her master's rage
4443,THE GIAOUR.,"In likeness of a Georgian page,"
4444,THE GIAOUR.,And far beyond the Moslem's power
4445,THE GIAOUR.,Had wronged him with the faithless Giaour.
4446,THE GIAOUR.,Somewhat of this had Hassan deemed;
4447,THE GIAOUR.,"But still so fond, so fair she seemed,                              460"
4448,THE GIAOUR.,Too well he trusted to the slave
4449,THE GIAOUR.,Whose treachery deserved a grave:
4450,THE GIAOUR.,"And on that eve had gone to Mosque,"
4451,THE GIAOUR.,And thence to feast in his Kiosk.
4452,THE GIAOUR.,"Such is the tale his Nubians tell,"
4453,THE GIAOUR.,Who did not watch their charge too well;
4454,THE GIAOUR.,"But others say, that on that night,"
4455,THE GIAOUR.,"By pale Phingari's[85] trembling light,"
4456,THE GIAOUR.,The Giaour upon his jet-black steed
4457,THE GIAOUR.,"Was seen, but seen alone to speed                                   470"

5071,THE GIAOUR.,"""I loved her, Friar! nay, adored--"
5072,THE GIAOUR.,But these are words that all can use--                         1030
5073,THE GIAOUR.,I proved it more in deed than word;
5074,THE GIAOUR.,"There's blood upon that dinted sword,"
5075,THE GIAOUR.,A stain its steel can never lose:
5076,THE GIAOUR.,"'Twas shed for her, who died for me,"
5077,THE GIAOUR.,It warmed the heart of one abhorred:
5078,THE GIAOUR.,"Nay, start not--no--nor bend thy knee,"
5079,THE GIAOUR.,Nor midst my sin such act record;
5080,THE GIAOUR.,"Thou wilt absolve me from the deed,"
5081,THE GIAOUR.,For he was hostile to thy creed!
5082,THE GIAOUR.,The very name of Nazarene                                        1040
5083,THE GIAOUR.,Was wormwood to his Paynim spleen.
5084,THE GIAOUR.,Ungrateful fool! since but for brands
5085,THE GIAOUR.,"Well wielded in some hardy hands,"
5086,THE GIAOUR.,And wounds by Galileans given--
5087,THE GIAOUR.,The surest pass to Turkish heaven--
5088,THE GIAOUR.,For him his Houris still might wait
5089,THE GIAOUR.,Impatient at the Prophet's gate.
5090,THE GIAOUR.,I loved her--Love will find its way
5091,THE GIAOUR.,Through paths where wolves would fear to prey;
5092,THE GIAOUR.,"And if it dares enough,'twere hard                               1050"
5093,THE GIAOUR.,If Passion met not some reward--
5094,THE GIAOUR.,"No matter how, or where, or why,"
5095,THE GIAOUR.,"I did not vainly seek, nor sigh:"
5096,THE GIAOUR.,"Yet sometimes, with remorse, in vain"
5097,THE GIAOUR.,I wish she had not loved again.
5098,THE GIAOUR.,She died--I dare not tell thee how;
5099,THE GIAOUR.,But look--'tis written on my brow!
5100,THE GIAOUR.,"There read of Cain the curse and crime,"
5101,THE GIAOUR.,In characters unworn by Time:
5102,THE GIAOUR.,"Still, ere thou dost condemn me, pause;                          1060"
5103,THE GIAOUR.,"Not mine the act, though I the cause."
5104,THE GIAOUR.,Yet did he but what I had done
5105,THE GIAOUR.,Had she been false to more than one.
5106,THE GIAOUR.,Faithless to him--he gave the blow;
5107,THE GIAOUR.,But true to me--I laid him low:
5108,THE GIAOUR.,"Howe'er deserved her doom might be,"
5109,THE GIAOUR.,Her treachery was truth to me;
5110,THE GIAOUR.,"To me she gave her heart, that all"
5111,THE GIAOUR.,Which Tyranny can ne'er enthrall;
5112,THE GIAOUR.,"And I, alas! too late to save!                                   1070"
5113,THE GIAOUR.,"Yet all I then could give, I gave--"
5114,THE GIAOUR.,'Twas some relief--our foe a grave.[ed]
5115,THE GIAOUR.,His death sits lightly; but her fate
5116,THE GIAOUR.,Has made me--what thou well mayst hate.
5117,THE GIAOUR.,"His doom was sealed--he knew it well,"
5118,THE GIAOUR.,"Warned by the voice of stern Taheer,"
5119,THE GIAOUR.,Deep in whose darkly boding ear[117]
5120,THE GIAOUR.,"The deathshot pealed of murder near,"
5121,THE GIAOUR.,As filed the troop to where they fell!
5122,THE GIAOUR.,"He died too in the battle broil,                                 1080"
5123,THE GIAOUR.,A time that heeds nor pain nor toil;
5124,THE GIAOUR.,"One cry to Mahomet for aid,"
5125,THE GIAOUR.,One prayer to Alla all he made:
5126,THE GIAOUR.,He knew and crossed me in the fray--
5127,THE GIAOUR.,"I gazed upon him where he lay,"
5128,THE GIAOUR.,And watched his spirit ebb away:
5129,THE GIAOUR.,"Though pierced like pard by hunter's steel,"
5130,THE GIAOUR.,He felt not half that now I feel.
5131,THE GIAOUR.,"I searched, but vainly searched, to find"
5132,THE GIAOUR.,The workings of a wounded mind;                                  1090
5133,THE GIAOUR.,Each feature of that sullen corse
5134,THE GIAOUR.,"Betrayed his rage, but no remorse.[118]"
5135,THE GIAOUR.,"Oh, what had Vengeance given to trace"
5136,THE GIAOUR.,Despair upon his dying face!
5137,THE GIAOUR.,The late repentance of that hour
5138,THE GIAOUR.,When Penitence hath lost her power
5139,THE GIAOUR.,"To tear one terror from the grave,[ee]"
5140,THE GIAOUR.,"And will not soothe, and cannot save."

5143,THE GIAOUR.,
5144,THE GIAOUR.,"""The cold in clime are cold in blood,"
5145,THE GIAOUR.,Their love can scarce deserve the name;                          1100
5146,THE GIAOUR.,But mine was like the lava flood
5147,THE GIAOUR.,That boils in Ætna's breast of flame.
5148,THE GIAOUR.,I cannot prate in puling strain
5149,THE GIAOUR.,"Of Ladye-love, and Beauty's chain:"
5150,THE GIAOUR.,"If changing cheek, and scorching vein,[ef]"
5151,THE GIAOUR.,"Lips taught to writhe, but not complain,"
5152,THE GIAOUR.,"If bursting heart, and maddening brain,"
5153,THE GIAOUR.,"And daring deed, and vengeful steel,"
5154,THE GIAOUR.,"And all that I have felt, and feel,"
5155,THE GIAOUR.,"Betoken love--that love was mine,                                1110"
5156,THE GIAOUR.,And shown by many a bitter sign.
5157,THE GIAOUR.,"'Tis true, I could not whine nor sigh,"
5158,THE GIAOUR.,I knew but to obtain or die.
5159,THE GIAOUR.,"I die--but first I have possessed,"
5160,THE GIAOUR.,"And come what may, I _have been_ blessed."
5161,THE GIAOUR.,Shall I the doom I sought upbraid?
5162,THE GIAOUR.,"No--reft of all, yet undismayed[eg]"
5163,THE GIAOUR.,"But for the thought of Leila slain,"
5164,THE GIAOUR.,"Give me the pleasure with the pain,"
5165,THE GIAOUR.,So would I live and love again.                                  1120
5166,THE GIAOUR.,"I grieve, but not, my holy Guide!"
5167,THE GIAOUR.,"For him who dies, but her who died:"
5168,THE GIAOUR.,She sleeps beneath the wandering wave--
5169,THE GIAOUR.,"Ah! had she but an earthly grave,"
5170,THE GIAOUR.,This breaking heart and throbbing head
5171,THE GIAOUR.,Should seek and share her narrow bed.
5172,THE GIAOUR.,"She was a form of Life and Light,[119]"
5173,THE GIAOUR.,"That, seen, became a part of sight;"
5174,THE GIAOUR.,"And rose, where'er I turned mine eye,"
5175,THE GIAOUR.,The Morning-star of Memory!                                      1130
5176,THE GIAOUR.,
5177,THE GIAOUR.,"""Yes, Love indeed is light from heaven;[eh][120]"
5178,THE GIAOUR.,A spark of that immortal fire
5179,THE GIAOUR.,"With angels shared, by Alia given,"
5180,THE GIAOUR.,To lift from earth our low desire.
5181,THE GIAOUR.,"Devotion wafts the mind above,"
5182,THE GIAOUR.,But Heaven itself descends in Love;
5183,THE GIAOUR.,"A feeling from the Godhead caught,"
5184,THE GIAOUR.,To wean from self each sordid thought;
5185,THE GIAOUR.,A ray of Him who formed the whole;
5186,THE GIAOUR.,A Glory circling round the soul!                                 1140
5187,THE GIAOUR.,"I grant _my_ love imperfect, all"
5188,THE GIAOUR.,That mortals by the name miscall;
5189,THE GIAOUR.,"Then deem it evil, what thou wilt;"
5190,THE GIAOUR.,"But say, oh say, _hers_ was not Guilt!"
5191,THE GIAOUR.,She was my Life's unerring Light:
5192,THE GIAOUR.,That quenched--what beam shall break my night?[ei]
5193,THE GIAOUR.,"Oh! would it shone to lead me still,"
5194,THE GIAOUR.,Although to death or deadliest ill!
5195,THE GIAOUR.,"Why marvel ye, if they who lose"
5196,THE GIAOUR.,"This present joy, this future hope,                            1150"
5197,THE GIAOUR.,No more with Sorrow meekly cope;
5198,THE GIAOUR.,In phrensy then their fate accuse;
5199,THE GIAOUR.,In madness do those fearful deeds
5200,THE GIAOUR.,That seem to add but Guilt to Woe?
5201,THE GIAOUR.,Alas! the breast that inly bleeds
5202,THE GIAOUR.,Hath nought to dread from outward blow:
5203,THE GIAOUR.,"Who falls from all he knows of bliss,"
5204,THE GIAOUR.,Cares little into what abyss.[ej]
5205,THE GIAOUR.,Fierce as the gloomy vulture's now
5206,THE GIAOUR.,"To thee, old man, my deeds appear:                             1160"
5207,THE GIAOUR.,"I read abhorrence on thy brow,"
5208,THE GIAOUR.,And this too was I born to bear!
5209,THE GIAOUR.,"'Tis true, that, like that bird of prey,"
5210,THE GIAOUR.,With havock have I marked my way:
5211,THE GIAOUR.,"But this was taught me by the dove,"
5212,THE GIAOUR.,To die--and know no second love.
5213,THE GIAOUR.,"This lesson yet hath man to learn,"
5214,THE GIAOUR.,Taught by the thing he dares to spurn:
5215,THE GIAOUR.,"The bird that sings within the brake,"
5216,THE GIAOUR.,"The swan that swims upon the lake,                               1170"
5217,THE GIAOUR.,"One mate, and one alone, will take."
5218,THE GIAOUR.,"And let the fool still prone to range,[ek]"
5219,THE GIAOUR.,"And sneer on all who cannot change,"
5220,THE GIAOUR.,Partake his jest with boasting boys;
5221,THE GIAOUR.,"I envy not his varied joys,"
5222,THE GIAOUR.,"But deem such feeble, heartless man,"
5223,THE GIAOUR.,Less than yon solitary swan;
5224,THE GIAOUR.,"Far, far beneath the shallow maid[el]"
5225,THE GIAOUR.,He left believing and betrayed.
5226,THE GIAOUR.,Such shame at least was never mine--                             1180
5227,THE GIAOUR.,Leila! each thought was only thine!
5228,THE GIAOUR.,"My good, my guilt, my weal, my woe,"

5230,THE GIAOUR.,"Each holds no other like to thee,"
5231,THE GIAOUR.,"Or, if it doth, in vain for me:"
5232,THE GIAOUR.,For worlds I dare not view the dame
5233,THE GIAOUR.,"Resembling thee, yet not the same."
5234,THE GIAOUR.,"The very crimes that mar my youth,"
5235,THE GIAOUR.,This bed of death--attest my truth!
5236,THE GIAOUR.,"'Tis all too late--thou wert, thou art                           1190"
5237,THE GIAOUR.,The cherished madness of my heart![em]
5238,THE GIAOUR.,
5239,THE GIAOUR.,"""And she was lost--and yet I breathed,"
5240,THE GIAOUR.,But not the breath of human life:
5241,THE GIAOUR.,"A serpent round my heart was wreathed,"
5242,THE GIAOUR.,And stung my every thought to strife.
5243,THE GIAOUR.,"Alike all time, abhorred all place,[en]"
5244,THE GIAOUR.,"Shuddering I shrank from Nature's face,"
5245,THE GIAOUR.,Where every hue that charmed before
5246,THE GIAOUR.,The blackness of my bosom wore.
5247,THE GIAOUR.,"The rest thou dost already know,                                 1200"
5248,THE GIAOUR.,"And all my sins, and half my woe."
5249,THE GIAOUR.,But talk no more of penitence;
5250,THE GIAOUR.,Thou seest I soon shall part from hence:
5251,THE GIAOUR.,"And if thy holy tale were true,"
5252,THE GIAOUR.,The deed that's done canst _thou_ undo?
5253,THE GIAOUR.,Think me not thankless--but this grief
5254,THE GIAOUR.,Looks not to priesthood for relief.[eo][121]
5255,THE GIAOUR.,My soul's estate in secret guess:
5256,THE GIAOUR.,"But wouldst thou pity more, say less."
5257,THE GIAOUR.,"When thou canst bid my Leila live,                               1210"
5258,THE GIAOUR.,Then will I sue thee to forgive;
5259,THE GIAOUR.,Then plead my cause in that high place
5260,THE GIAOUR.,Where purchased masses proffer grace.[ep]
5261,THE GIAOUR.,"Go, when the hunter's hand hath wrung"
5262,THE GIAOUR.,"From forest-cave her shrieking young,"
5263,THE GIAOUR.,And calm the lonely lioness:
5264,THE GIAOUR.,But soothe not--mock not _my_ distress!
5265,THE GIAOUR.,
5266,THE GIAOUR.,"""In earlier days, and calmer hours,"
5267,THE GIAOUR.,"When heart with heart delights to blend,"

5269,THE GIAOUR.,I had--Ah! have I now?--a friend![er]
5270,THE GIAOUR.,"To him this pledge I charge thee send,[es]"
5271,THE GIAOUR.,Memorial of a youthful vow;
5272,THE GIAOUR.,I would remind him of my end:
5273,THE GIAOUR.,Though souls absorbed like mine allow
5274,THE GIAOUR.,"Brief thought to distant Friendship's claim,"
5275,THE GIAOUR.,Yet dear to him my blighted name.
5276,THE GIAOUR.,"'Tis strange--he prophesied my doom,"
5277,THE GIAOUR.,And I have smiled--I then could smile--
5278,THE GIAOUR.,"When Prudence would his voice assume,                            1230"
5279,THE GIAOUR.,And warn--I recked not what--the while:
5280,THE GIAOUR.,But now Remembrance whispers o'er[et]
5281,THE GIAOUR.,Those accents scarcely marked before.
5282,THE GIAOUR.,"Say--that his bodings came to pass,"
5283,THE GIAOUR.,"And he will start to hear their truth,"
5284,THE GIAOUR.,And wish his words had not been sooth:
5285,THE GIAOUR.,"Tell him--unheeding as I was,"
5286,THE GIAOUR.,Through many a busy bitter scene
5287,THE GIAOUR.,"Of all our golden youth had been,"
5288,THE GIAOUR.,"In pain, my faltering tongue had tried                           1240"
5289,THE GIAOUR.,To bless his memory--ere I died;
5290,THE GIAOUR.,"But Heaven in wrath would turn away,"
5291,THE GIAOUR.,If Guilt should for the guiltless pray.
5292,THE GIAOUR.,"I do not ask him not to blame,"
5293,THE GIAOUR.,Too gentle he to wound my name;
5294,THE GIAOUR.,And what have I to do with Fame?
5295,THE GIAOUR.,"I do not ask him not to mourn,"
5296,THE GIAOUR.,Such cold request might sound like scorn;
5297,THE GIAOUR.,And what than Friendship's manly tear
5298,THE GIAOUR.,May better grace a brother's bier?                               1250

5333,THE GIAOUR.,Is fleeting towards the final goal.
5334,THE GIAOUR.,I saw her--friar! and I rose
5335,THE GIAOUR.,Forgetful of our former woes;
5336,THE GIAOUR.,"And rushing from my couch, I dart,"
5337,THE GIAOUR.,And clasp her to my desperate heart;

5339,THE GIAOUR.,"No breathing form within my grasp,"
5340,THE GIAOUR.,No heart that beats reply to mine--

5348,THE GIAOUR.,They shrink upon my lonely breast;
5349,THE GIAOUR.,"Yet still 'tis there! In silence stands,"
5350,THE GIAOUR.,And beckons with beseeching hands!
5351,THE GIAOUR.,"With braided hair, and bright-black eye--                        1300"
5352,THE GIAOUR.,I knew 'twas false--she could not die!
5353,THE GIAOUR.,But _he_ is dead! within the dell

5355,THE GIAOUR.,He comes not--for he cannot break
5356,THE GIAOUR.,From earth;--why then art _thou_ awake?
5357,THE GIAOUR.,They told me wild waves rolled above
5358,THE GIAOUR.,The face I view--the form I love;
5359,THE GIAOUR.,They told me--'twas a hideous tale!--
5360,THE GIAOUR.,"I'd tell it, but my tongue would fail:"

7612,XV.,"Why me the stern Usurper spared,"

7635,XVI.,Which holds he here--he saw him die;
7636,XVI.,But what could single slavery do?
7637,XVI.,Avenge his lord? alas! too late;

7645,XVI.,The knowledge of my birth secured

8077,XXVIII.,And buds unsheltered by a bower;
8078,XXVIII.,"Nor droops, though Spring refuse her shower,"

8080,XXVIII.,To it the livelong night there sings

8088,XXVIII.,"The spot, but linger there and grieve,"

9352,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","not the most difficult, but, perhaps, the best adapted measure to our"

9354,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","Spenser is perhaps too slow and dignified for narrative; though, I"
9355,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","confess, it is the measure most after my own heart; Scott alone,[195] of"
9356,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","the present generation, has hitherto completely triumphed over the fatal"
9357,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.",facility of the octosyllabic verse; and this is not the least victory of
9358,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","his fertile and mighty genius: in blank verse, Milton, Thomson, and our"
9359,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","dramatists, are the beacons that shine along the deep, but warn us from"
9360,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.",the rough and barren rock on which they are kindled. The heroic couplet
9361,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.",is not the most popular measure certainly; but as I did not deviate
9362,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","into the other from a wish to flatter what is called public opinion, I"
9363,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","shall quit it without further apology, and take my chance once more with"
9364,"TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.","that versification, in which I have hitherto published nothing but"

9525,IV.,When hand grasps hand uniting on the beach;

9553,VI.,"And freshness breathing from each silver spring,"
9554,VI.,"Whose scattered streams from granite basins burst,"
9555,VI.,"Leap into life, and sparkling woo your thirst;"
9556,VI.,"From crag to cliff they mount--Near yonder cave,"

9610,VIII.,"Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh;"
9611,VIII.,"Whose name appals the fiercest of his crew,"
9612,VIII.,And tints each swarthy cheek with sallower hue;

9618,VIII.,The power of Thought--the magic of the Mind!
9619,VIII.,"Linked with success, assumed and kept with skill,"
9620,VIII.,That moulds another's weakness to its will;
9621,VIII.,"Wields with their hands, but, still to these unknown,"
9622,VIII.,Makes even their mightiest deeds appear his own.
9623,VIII.,Such hath it been--shall be--beneath the Sun

9637,IX.,No giant frame sets forth his common height;
9638,IX.,"Yet, in the whole, who paused to look again,"
9639,IX.,Saw more than marks the crowd of vulgar men;                        200

9645,IX.,"The haughtier thought it curbs, but scarce conceals.[hn]"

9649,IX.,"At times attracted, yet perplexed the view,                         210"

9651,IX.,"Worked feelings fearful, and yet undefined;"

9653,IX.,Too close inquiry his stern glance would quell.
9654,IX.,There breathe but few whose aspect might defy
9655,IX.,The full encounter of his searching eye;

9661,IX.,"Some secret thought, than drag that Chief's to day."
9662,IX.,"There was a laughing Devil in his sneer,"

9700,XI.,"Too firm to yield, and far too proud to stoop,"
9701,XI.,"Doomed by his very virtues for a dupe,"

9709,XI.,To pay the injuries of some on all.
9710,XI.,He knew himself a villain--but he deemed
9711,XI.,The rest no better than the thing he seemed;
9712,XI.,And scorned the best as hypocrites who hid
9713,XI.,Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.

9767,XIII.,Till here they hunt us to undoubted fate;
9768,XIII.,"And, if my plan but hold, and Fortune smile,"
9769,XIII.,We'll furnish mourners for our funeral pile.
9770,XIII.,"Aye, let them slumber--peaceful be their dreams!"

9778,XIII.,"This common courage which with brutes we share,"

9839,XIV.,"Oh! many a night on this lone couch reclined,"
9840,XIV.,"My dreaming fear with storms hath winged the wind,"

9842,XIV.,The murmuring prelude of the ruder gale;
9843,XIV.,"Though soft--it seemed the low prophetic dirge,"
9844,XIV.,That mourned thee floating on the savage surge:
9845,XIV.,"Still would I rise to rouse the beacon fire,"
9846,XIV.,Lest spies less true should let the blaze expire;
9847,XIV.,"And many a restless hour outwatched each star,"
9848,XIV.,And morning came--and still thou wert afar.                         380
9849,XIV.,"Oh! how the chill blast on my bosom blew,"
9850,XIV.,"And day broke dreary on my troubled view,"
9851,XIV.,And still I gazed and gazed--and not a prow

9894,XIV.,"And where not sure, perplexed, but pleased, I guessed"

9896,XIV.,My steps have wound to try the coolest rill;
9897,XIV.,"Yes! thy Sherbet to-night will sweetly flow,"
9898,XIV.,See how it sparkles in its vase of snow!
9899,XIV.,The grapes' gay juice thy bosom never cheers;
9900,XIV.,Thou more than Moslem when the cup appears:                         430

9902,XIV.,What others deem a penance is thy choice.

9924,XIV.,The time of parting with redoubled wing:
9925,XIV.,"The why, the where--what boots it now to tell?"
9926,XIV.,Since all must end in that wild word--Farewell!

9936,XIV.,"""One kiss--one more--another--Oh! Adieu!"""
9937,XIV.,"She rose--she sprung--she clung to his embrace,"
9938,XIV.,Till his heart heaved beneath her hidden face:
9939,XIV.,"He dared not raise to his that deep-blue eye,"
9940,XIV.,Which downcast drooped in tearless agony.
9941,XIV.,"Her long fair hair lay floating o'er his arms,                      470"
9942,XIV.,In all the wildness of dishevelled charms;
9943,XIV.,Scarce beat that bosom where his image dwelt
9944,XIV.,So full--_that_ feeling seem'd almost unfelt!
9945,XIV.,Hark--peals the thunder of the signal-gun!
9946,XIV.,"It told 'twas sunset, and he cursed that sun."

9951,XIV.,"Felt that for him Earth held but her alone,                         480"
9952,XIV.,Kissed her cold forehead--turned--is Conrad gone?
9953,XIV.,
9954,XV.,XV.
9955,XV.,
9956,XV.,"""And is he gone?""--on sudden solitude"

9958,XV.,"""'Twas but an instant past, and here he stood!"
9959,XV.,"And now""--without the portal's porch she rushed,"
9960,XV.,And then at length her tears in freedom gushed;
9961,XV.,"Big, bright, and fast, unknown to her they fell;"
9962,XV.,"But still her lips refused to send--""Farewell!"""
9963,XV.,For in that word--that fatal word--howe'er

9965,XV.,"O'er every feature of that still, pale face,"
9966,XV.,Had Sorrow fixed what Time can ne'er erase:

9968,XV.,"Grew frozen with its gaze on vacancy,"
9969,XV.,"Till--Oh, how far!--it caught a glimpse of him,"
9970,XV.,"And then it flowed, and phrensied seemed to swim"

9974,XV.,Convulsed and quick--then gently raised to Heaven:                  500
9975,XV.,She looked and saw the heaving of the main:
9976,XV.,The white sail set--she dared not look again;
9977,XV.,But turned with sickening soul within the gate--
9978,XV.,"""It is no dream--and I am desolate!"""
9979,XV.,
9980,XVI.,XVI.
9981,XVI.,
9982,XVI.,"From crag to crag descending, swiftly sped"
9983,XVI.,"Stern Conrad down, nor once he turned his head;"
9984,XVI.,But shrunk whene'er the windings of his way
9985,XVI.,"Forced on his eye what he would not survey,"
9986,XVI.,"His lone, but lovely dwelling on the steep,"
9987,XVI.,That hailed him first when homeward from the deep:                  510
9988,XVI.,"And she--the dim and melancholy Star,"
9989,XVI.,"Whose ray of Beauty reached him from afar,"
9990,XVI.,"On her he must not gaze, he must not think--"
9991,XVI.,There he might rest--but on Destruction's brink:
9992,XVI.,Yet once almost he stopped--and nearly gave
9993,XVI.,"His fate to chance, his projects to the wave:"
9994,XVI.,But no--it must not be--a worthy chief
9995,XVI.,"May melt, but not betray to Woman's grief."
9996,XVI.,"He sees his bark, he notes how fair the wind,"
9997,XVI.,And sternly gathers all his might of mind:                          520
9998,XVI.,Again he hurries on--and as he hears
9999,XVI.,"The clang of tumult vibrate on his ears,"
10000,XVI.,"The busy sounds, the bustle of the shore,"
10001,XVI.,"The shout, the signal, and the dashing oar;"
10002,XVI.,"As marks his eye the seaboy on the mast,"
10003,XVI.,"The anchors rise, the sails unfurling fast,"
10004,XVI.,The waving kerchiefs of the crowd that urge
10005,XVI.,That mute Adieu to those who stem the surge;
10006,XVI.,"And more than all, his blood-red flag aloft,"
10007,XVI.,He marvelled how his heart could seem so soft.                      530
10008,XVI.,"Fire in his glance, and wildness in his breast,"
10009,XVI.,He feels of all his former self possest;
10010,XVI.,He bounds--he flies--until his footsteps reach
10011,XVI.,"The verge where ends the cliff, begins the beach,"
10012,XVI.,There checks his speed; but pauses less to breathe
10013,XVI.,"The breezy freshness of the deep beneath,"
10014,XVI.,Than there his wonted statelier step renew;
10015,XVI.,"Nor rush, disturbed by haste, to vulgar view:"
10016,XVI.,"For well had Conrad learned to curb the crowd,"
10017,XVI.,"By arts that veil, and oft preserve the proud;                      540"
10018,XVI.,"His was the lofty port, the distant mien,"
10019,XVI.,That seems to shun the sight--and awes if seen:
10020,XVI.,"The solemn aspect, and the high-born eye,"
10021,XVI.,"That checks low mirth, but lacks not courtesy;"
10022,XVI.,All these he wielded to command assent:
10023,XVI.,"But where he wished to win, so well unbent,"
10024,XVI.,"That Kindness cancelled fear in those who heard,"
10025,XVI.,"And others' gifts showed mean beside his word,"
10026,XVI.,When echoed to the heart as from his own
10027,XVI.,His deep yet tender melody of tone:                                 550
10028,XVI.,"But such was foreign to his wonted mood,"
10029,XVI.,"He cared not what he softened, but subdued;"
10030,XVI.,The evil passions of his youth had made
10031,XVI.,Him value less who loved--than what obeyed.

10048,XVII.,In three days (serve the breeze) the sun shall shine
10049,XVII.,"On our return--till then all peace be thine!"""
10050,XVII.,"This said, his brother Pirate's hand he wrung,"
10051,XVII.,Then to his boat with haughty gesture sprung.                       570
10052,XVII.,"Flashed the dipt oars, and sparkling with the stroke,"
10053,XVII.,Around the waves' phosphoric[205] brightness broke;

10055,XVII.,"Shrieks the shrill whistle, ply the busy hands--"
10056,XVII.,"He marks how well the ship her helm obeys,"
10057,XVII.,"How gallant all her crew, and deigns to praise."
10058,XVII.,His eyes of pride to young Gonsalvo turn--
10059,XVII.,"Why doth he start, and inly seem to mourn?"
10060,XVII.,"Alas! those eyes beheld his rocky tower,"
10061,XVII.,And live a moment o'er the parting hour;                            580
10062,XVII.,She--his Medora--did she mark the prow?
10063,XVII.,Ah! never loved he half so much as now!
10064,XVII.,But much must yet be done ere dawn of day--
10065,XVII.,Again he mans himself and turns away;
10066,XVII.,"Down to the cabin with Gonsalvo bends,"
10067,XVII.,"And there unfolds his plan--his means, and ends;"
10068,XVII.,"Before them burns the lamp, and spreads the chart,"
10069,XVII.,And all that speaks and aids the naval art;
10070,XVII.,They to the midnight watch protract debate;
10071,XVII.,To anxious eyes what hour is ever late?                             590
10072,XVII.,"Meantime, the steady breeze serenely blew,"
10073,XVII.,And fast and falcon-like the vessel flew;
10074,XVII.,"Passed the high headlands of each clustering isle,"
10075,XVII.,To gain their port--long--long ere morning smile:
10076,XVII.,And soon the night-glass through the narrow bay
10077,XVII.,Discovers where the Pacha's galleys lay.
10078,XVII.,"Count they each sail, and mark how there supine"
10079,XVII.,The lights in vain o'er heedless Moslem shine.
10080,XVII.,"Secure, unnoted, Conrad's prow passed by,"
10081,XVII.,And anchored where his ambush meant to lie;                         600
10082,XVII.,"Screened from espial by the jutting cape,"
10083,XVII.,That rears on high its rude fantastic shape.[206]
10084,XVII.,Then rose his band to duty--not from sleep--
10085,XVII.,Equipped for deeds alike on land or deep;

10968,VI.,"When every step that echoed by the gate,                           1380"

10974,VI.,'Twas worn--perhaps decayed--yet silent bore
10975,VI.,"That conflict, deadlier far than all before:"

10992,VI.,"The life thou leav'st below, denied above"

11012,VII.,Roused by the roar of his own element!
11013,VII.,"Oft had he ridden on that wingéd wave,"
11014,VII.,And loved its roughness for the speed it gave;
11015,VII.,"And now its dashing echoed on his ear,"
11016,VII.,A long known voice--alas! too vainly near!
11017,VII.,"Loud sung the wind above; and, doubly loud,"
11018,VII.,Shook o'er his turret cell the thunder-cloud;[232]
11019,VII.,"And flashed the lightning by the latticed bar,"
11020,VII.,To him more genial than the Midnight Star:
11021,VII.,"Close to the glimmering grate he dragged his chain,                1430"
11022,VII.,And hoped _that_ peril might not prove in vain.
11023,VII.,"He rais'd his iron hand to Heaven, and prayed"
11024,VII.,One pitying flash to mar the form it made:
11025,VII.,His steel and impious prayer attract alike--
11026,VII.,"The storm rolled onward, and disdained to strike;"
11027,VII.,"Its peal waxed fainter--ceased--he felt alone,"

11979,FOOTNOTES:,"few, we believe, were informed of the situation, history, or nature of"
11980,FOOTNOTES:,that establishment. For the information of such as were unacquainted
11981,FOOTNOTES:,"with it, we have procured from a friend the following interesting"
11982,FOOTNOTES:,"narrative of the main facts, of which he has personal knowledge, and"
11983,FOOTNOTES:,which cannot fail to interest some of our readers:--Barataria is a
11984,FOOTNOTES:,"bayou, or a narrow arm of the Gulf of Mexico; it runs through a rich but"
11985,FOOTNOTES:,"very flat country, until it reaches within a mile of the Mississippi"
11986,FOOTNOTES:,"river, fifteen miles below the city of New Orleans. This bayou has"
11987,FOOTNOTES:,"branches almost innumerable, in which persons can lie concealed from the"
11988,FOOTNOTES:,severest scrutiny. It communicates with three lakes which lie on the
11989,FOOTNOTES:,"south-west side, and these, with the lake of the same name, and which"
11990,FOOTNOTES:,"lies contiguous to the sea, where there is an island formed by the two"
11991,FOOTNOTES:,arms of this lake and the sea. The east and west points of this island
11992,FOOTNOTES:,"were fortified, in the year 1811, by a band of pirates, under the"
11993,FOOTNOTES:,command of one Monsieur La Fitte. A large majority of these outlaws are
11994,FOOTNOTES:,of that class of the population of the state of Louisiana who fled from
11995,FOOTNOTES:,"the island of St. Domingo during the troubles there, and took refuge in"
11996,FOOTNOTES:,the island of Cuba; and when the last war between France and Spain
11997,FOOTNOTES:,"commenced, they were compelled to leave that island with the short"
11998,FOOTNOTES:,"notice of a few days. Without ceremony they entered the United States,"
11999,FOOTNOTES:,"the most of them the state of Louisiana, with all the negroes they had"
12000,FOOTNOTES:,possessed in Cuba. They were notified by the Governor of that State of
12001,FOOTNOTES:,the clause in the constitution which forbade the importation of slaves;
12002,FOOTNOTES:,"but, at the same time, received the assurance of the Governor that he"
12003,FOOTNOTES:,"would obtain, if possible, the approbation of the General Government for"
12004,FOOTNOTES:,their retaining this property.--The island of Barataria is situated
12005,FOOTNOTES:,"about lat. 29 deg. 15 min., lon. 92. 30.; and is as remarkable for its"
12006,FOOTNOTES:,health as for the superior scale and shell fish with which its waters
12007,FOOTNOTES:,"abound. The chief of this horde, like Charles de Moor, had, mixed with"
12008,FOOTNOTES:,"his many vices, some transcendant virtues. In the year 1813, this party"
12009,FOOTNOTES:,"had, from its turpitude and boldness, claimed the attention of the"
12010,FOOTNOTES:,Governor of Louisiana; and to break up the establishment he thought
12011,FOOTNOTES:,"proper to strike at the head. He therefore, offered a reward of 500"
12012,FOOTNOTES:,"dollars for the head of Monsieur La Fitte, who was well known to the"
12013,FOOTNOTES:,"inhabitants of the city of New Orleans, from his immediate connection,"
12014,FOOTNOTES:,and his once having been a fencing-master in that city of great
12015,FOOTNOTES:,"reputation, which art he learnt in Buonaparte's army, where he was a"
12016,FOOTNOTES:,captain. The reward which was offered by the Governor for the head of La
12017,FOOTNOTES:,"Fitte was answered by the offer of a reward from the latter of 15,000"
12018,FOOTNOTES:,for the head of the Governor. The Governor ordered out a company to
12019,FOOTNOTES:,"march from the city to La Fitte's island, and to burn and destroy all"
12020,FOOTNOTES:,"the property, and to bring to the city of New Orleans all his banditti."
12021,FOOTNOTES:,"This company, under the command of a man who had been the intimate"
12022,FOOTNOTES:,"associate of this bold Captain, approached very near to the fortified"
12023,FOOTNOTES:,"island, before he saw a man, or heard a sound, until he heard a whistle,"
12024,FOOTNOTES:,not unlike a boatswain's call. Then it was he found himself surrounded
12025,FOOTNOTES:,by armed men who had emerged from the secret avenues which led to this
12026,FOOTNOTES:,bayou. Here it was that this modern Charles de Moor developed his few
12027,FOOTNOTES:,"noble traits; for to this man, who had come to destroy his life and all"
12028,FOOTNOTES:,"that was dear to him, he not only spared his life, but offered him that"
12029,FOOTNOTES:,which would have made the honest soldier easy for the remainder of his
12030,FOOTNOTES:,"days, which was indignantly refused. He then, with the approbation of"
12031,FOOTNOTES:,"his captor, returned to the city. This circumstance, and some"
12032,FOOTNOTES:,"concomitant events, proved that this band of pirates was not to be taken"
12033,FOOTNOTES:,"by land. Our naval force having always been small in that quarter,"
12034,FOOTNOTES:,exertions for the destruction of this illicit establishment could not be
12035,FOOTNOTES:,"expected from them until augmented; for an officer of the navy, with"
12036,FOOTNOTES:,"most of the gun-boats on that station, had to retreat from an"
12037,FOOTNOTES:,overwhelming force of La Fitte's. So soon as the augmentation of the
12038,FOOTNOTES:,"navy authorised an attack, one was made; the overthrow of this banditti"

12735,INTRODUCTION TO _LARA_,"letter dated May 4, 1814. There can be little doubt that both song and"

12757,INTRODUCTION TO _LARA_,"1899, iii. 102). But Rogers hesitated, and Moore refused to embark on so"
12758,INTRODUCTION TO _LARA_,"doubtful a venture, with the result that, as late as the 3rd of August,"
12759,INTRODUCTION TO _LARA_,"Byron thought fit to remonstrate with Murray for ""advertising _Lara and"

12970,VIII.,To curse the withered heart that would not break.                   130
12971,VIII.,
12972,IX.,IX.
12973,IX.,
12974,IX.,"Books, for his volume heretofore was Man,"
12975,IX.,"With eye more curious he appeared to scan,"
12976,IX.,"And oft in sudden mood, for many a day,"
12977,IX.,From all communion he would start away:
12978,IX.,"And then, his rarely called attendants said,"
12979,IX.,Through night's long hours would sound his hurried tread
12980,IX.,"O'er the dark gallery, where his fathers frowned"
12981,IX.,In rude but antique portraiture around:
12982,IX.,"They heard, but whispered--""_that_ must not be known--"
12983,IX.,The sound of words less earthly than his own.[jj]                   140
12984,IX.,"Yes, they who chose might smile, but some had seen"
12985,IX.,"They scarce knew what, but more than should have been."
12986,IX.,Why gazed he so upon the ghastly head[270]
12987,IX.,"Which hands profane had gathered from the dead,"
12988,IX.,"That still beside his opened volume lay,"
12989,IX.,As if to startle all save him away?
12990,IX.,Why slept he not when others were at rest?
12991,IX.,"Why heard no music, and received no guest?"
12992,IX.,"All was not well, they deemed--but where the wrong?[271]"
12993,IX.,Some knew perchance--but 'twere a tale too long;                    150
12994,IX.,"And such besides were too discreetly wise,"
12995,IX.,To more than hint their knowledge in surmise;
12996,IX.,"But if they would--they could""--around the board"
12997,IX.,Thus Lara's vassals prattled of their lord.
12998,IX.,
12999,X.,X.
13000,X.,
13001,X.,It was the night--and Lara's glassy stream
13002,X.,"The stars are studding, each with imaged beam;"
13003,X.,"So calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray,"
13004,X.,And yet they glide like Happiness away;[272]
13005,X.,Reflecting far and fairy-like from high
13006,X.,The immortal lights that live along the sky:                        160
13007,X.,"Its banks are fringed with many a goodly tree,"
13008,X.,And flowers the fairest that may feast the bee;
13009,X.,"Such in her chaplet infant Dian wove,"
13010,X.,And Innocence would offer to her love.
13011,X.,These deck the shore; the waves their channel make
13012,X.,In windings bright and mazy like the snake.
13013,X.,"All was so still, so soft in earth and air,"
13014,X.,You scarce would start to meet a spirit there;
13015,X.,Secure that nought of evil could delight
13016,X.,"To walk in such a scene, on such a night!                           170"
13017,X.,It was a moment only for the good:
13018,X.,"So Lara deemed, nor longer there he stood,"
13019,X.,But turned in silence to his castle-gate;
13020,X.,Such scene his soul no more could contemplate:
13021,X.,"Such scene reminded him of other days,"
13022,X.,"Of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,"
13023,X.,"Of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now--"
13024,X.,"No--no--the storm may beat upon his brow,"
13025,X.,"Unfelt, unsparing--but a night like this,"
13026,X.,"A night of Beauty, mocked such breast as his.                       180"
13027,X.,
13028,XI.,XI.
13029,XI.,
13030,XI.,"He turned within his solitary hall,"
13031,XI.,And his high shadow shot along the wall:
13032,XI.,"There were the painted forms of other times,[273]"
13033,XI.,"'Twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,"
13034,XI.,Save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults
13035,XI.,"That hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;"
13036,XI.,"And half a column of the pompous page,"
13037,XI.,That speeds the specious tale from age to age;
13038,XI.,"Where History's pen its praise or blame supplies,"
13039,XI.,"And lies like Truth, and still most truly lies.                     190"
13040,XI.,"He wandering mused, and as the moonbeam shone"
13041,XI.,"Through the dim lattice, o'er the floor of stone,"
13042,XI.,"And the high fretted roof, and saints, that there"
13043,XI.,"O'er Gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,[jk]"
13044,XI.,"Reflected in fantastic figures grew,"
13045,XI.,"Like life, but not like mortal life, to view;"
13046,XI.,"His bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,"
13047,XI.,"And the wide waving of his shaken plume,"
13048,XI.,Glanced like a spectre's attributes--and gave
13049,XI.,His aspect all that terror gives the grave.[jl]                     200
13050,XI.,
13051,XII.,XII.
13052,XII.,
13053,XII.,'Twas midnight--all was slumber; the lone light
13054,XII.,"Dimmed in the lamp, as both to break the night."
13055,XII.,Hark! there be murmurs heard in Lara's hall--
13056,XII.,A sound--a voice--a shriek--a fearful call!
13057,XII.,"A long, loud shriek--and silence--did they hear"
13058,XII.,That frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?
13059,XII.,"They heard and rose, and, tremulously brave,"
13060,XII.,Rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;
13061,XII.,"They come with half-lit tapers in their hands,"
13062,XII.,And snatched in startled haste unbelted brands.                     210
13063,XII.,
13064,XIII.,XIII.
13065,XIII.,
13066,XIII.,"Cold as the marble where his length was laid,"
13067,XIII.,"Pale as the beam that o'er his features played,"
13068,XIII.,"Was Lara stretched; his half-drawn sabre near,"
13069,XIII.,Dropped it should seem in more than Nature's fear;
13070,XIII.,"Yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,"
13071,XIII.,And still Defiance knit his gathered brow;
13072,XIII.,"Though mixed with terror, senseless as he lay,"
13073,XIII.,There lived upon his lip the wish to slay;
13074,XIII.,"Some half formed threat in utterance there had died,"
13075,XIII.,Some imprecation of despairing Pride;                               220
13076,XIII.,"His eye was almost sealed, but not forsook,"
13077,XIII.,"Even in its trance, the gladiator's look,"
13078,XIII.,"That oft awake his aspect could disclose,"
13079,XIII.,And now was fixed in horrible repose.
13080,XIII.,"They raise him--bear him;--hush! he breathes, he speaks,"
13081,XIII.,"The swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,"
13082,XIII.,"His lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,"
13083,XIII.,"Rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb"
13084,XIII.,"Recalls its function, but his words are strung"
13085,XIII.,In terms that seem not of his native tongue;                        230
13086,XIII.,"Distinct but strange, enough they understand"
13087,XIII.,To deem them accents of another land;
13088,XIII.,"And such they were, and meant to meet an ear"
13089,XIII.,That hears him not--alas! that cannot hear!
13090,XIII.,
13091,XIV.,XIV.
13092,XIV.,
13093,XIV.,"His page approached, and he alone appeared"
13094,XIV.,To know the import of the words they heard;
13095,XIV.,"And, by the changes of his cheek and brow,"
13096,XIV.,"They were not such as Lara should avow,"
13097,XIV.,"Nor he interpret,--yet with less surprise"
13098,XIV.,"Than those around their Chieftain's state he eyes,                  240"
13099,XIV.,"But Lara's prostrate form he bent beside,"
13100,XIV.,And in that tongue which seemed his own replied;
13101,XIV.,And Lara heeds those tones that gently seem
13102,XIV.,To soothe away the horrors of his dream--
13103,XIV.,"If dream it were, that thus could overthrow"
13104,XIV.,A breast that needed not ideal woe.
13105,XIV.,
13106,XV.,XV.
13107,XV.,
13108,XV.,"Whate'er his frenzy dreamed or eye beheld,--"
13109,XV.,"If yet remembered ne'er to be revealed,--"
13110,XV.,"Rests at his heart: the customed morning came,"
13111,XV.,And breathed new vigour in his shaken frame;                        250
13112,XV.,"And solace sought he none from priest nor leech,"
13113,XV.,"And soon the same in movement and in speech,"
13114,XV.,"As heretofore he filled the passing hours,"
13115,XV.,"Nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lowers,"
13116,XV.,Than these were wont; and if the coming night
13117,XV.,"Appeared less welcome now to Lara's sight,"
13118,XV.,"He to his marvelling vassals showed it not,"
13119,XV.,Whose shuddering proved _their_ fear was less forgot.
13120,XV.,In trembling pairs (alone they dared not) crawl[jm]
13121,XV.,"The astonished slaves, and shun the fated hall;                     260"
13122,XV.,"The waving banner, and the clapping door,"
13123,XV.,"The rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;"
13124,XV.,"The long dim shadows of surrounding trees,"
13125,XV.,"The flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;"
13126,XV.,"Aught they behold or hear their thought appals,"
13127,XV.,As evening saddens o'er the dark grey walls.
13128,XV.,
13129,XVI.,XVI.
13130,XVI.,
13131,XVI.,Vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravelled gloom
13132,XVI.,"Came not again, or Lara could assume"
13133,XVI.,"A seeming of forgetfulness, that made"
13134,XVI.,His vassals more amazed nor less afraid.                            270
13135,XVI.,Had Memory vanished then with sense restored?
13136,XVI.,"Since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord"
13137,XVI.,Betrayed a feeling that recalled to these
13138,XVI.,That fevered moment of his mind's disease.
13139,XVI.,Was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke
13140,XVI.,Those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke
13141,XVI.,"Their slumber? his the oppressed, o'erlaboured heart"
13142,XVI.,"That ceased to beat, the look that made them start?"
13143,XVI.,"Could he who thus had suffered so forget,"
13144,XVI.,When such as saw that suffering shudder yet?                        280
13145,XVI.,Or did that silence prove his memory fixed
13146,XVI.,"Too deep for words, indelible, unmixed"
13147,XVI.,In that corroding secrecy which gnaws
13148,XVI.,"The heart to show the effect, but not the cause?"
13149,XVI.,"Not so in him; his breast had buried both,"
13150,XVI.,Nor common gazers could discern the growth
13151,XVI.,Of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;
13152,XVI.,They choke the feeble words that would unfold.
13153,XVI.,
13154,XVII.,XVII.
13155,XVII.,
13156,XVII.,In him inexplicably mixed appeared
13157,XVII.,"Much to be loved and hated, sought and feared;                      290"
13158,XVII.,"Opinion varying o'er his hidden lot,[jn]"
13159,XVII.,In praise or railing ne'er his name forgot:
13160,XVII.,His silence formed a theme for others' prate--
13161,XVII.,They guessed--they gazed--they fain would know his fate.
13162,XVII.,"What had he been? what was he, thus unknown,"
13163,XVII.,"Who walked their world, his lineage only known?"
13164,XVII.,"A hater of his kind? yet some would say,"
13165,XVII.,With them he could seem gay amidst the gay;[jo]
13166,XVII.,"But owned that smile, if oft observed and near,"
13167,XVII.,"Waned in its mirth, and withered to a sneer;                        300"
13168,XVII.,"That smile might reach his lip, but passed not by,"
13169,XVII.,Nor e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:
13170,XVII.,"Yet there was softness too in his regard,"
13171,XVII.,"At times, a heart as not by nature hard,"
13172,XVII.,"But once perceived, his Spirit seemed to chide"
13173,XVII.,"Such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,"
13174,XVII.,"And steeled itself, as scorning to redeem"
13175,XVII.,One doubt from others' half withheld esteem;
13176,XVII.,In self-inflicted penance of a breast
13177,XVII.,Which Tenderness might once have wrung from Rest;                   310
13178,XVII.,In vigilance of Grief that would compel
13179,XVII.,The soul to hate for having loved too well.[274]
13180,XVII.,
13181,XVIII.,XVIII.
13182,XVIII.,
13183,XVIII.,There was in him a vital scorn of all:[jp]
13184,XVIII.,"As if the worst had fallen which could befall,"
13185,XVIII.,"He stood a stranger in this breathing world,"
13186,XVIII.,An erring Spirit from another hurled;
13187,XVIII.,"A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped"
13188,XVIII.,By choice the perils he by chance escaped;
13189,XVIII.,"But 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet"
13190,XVIII.,His mind would half exult and half regret:                          320
13191,XVIII.,With more capacity for love than Earth
13192,XVIII.,Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth.
13193,XVIII.,"His early dreams of good outstripped the truth,[275]"
13194,XVIII.,And troubled Manhood followed baffled Youth;
13195,XVIII.,"With thought of years in phantom chase misspent,"
13196,XVIII.,And wasted powers for better purpose lent;
13197,XVIII.,And fiery passions that had poured their wrath
13198,XVIII.,"In hurried desolation o'er his path,"
13199,XVIII.,And left the better feelings all at strife[jq]
13200,XVIII.,In wild reflection o'er his stormy life;                            330
13201,XVIII.,"But haughty still, and loth himself to blame,"
13202,XVIII.,"He called on Nature's self to share the shame,"
13203,XVIII.,And charged all faults upon the fleshly form
13204,XVIII.,"She gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm:"
13205,XVIII.,"Till he at last confounded good and ill,"
13206,XVIII.,And half mistook for fate the acts of will:[jr][276]
13207,XVIII.,"Too high for common selfishness, he could"
13208,XVIII.,"At times resign his own for others' good,"
13209,XVIII.,"But not in pity--not because he ought,"
13210,XVIII.,"But in some strange perversity of thought,                          340"
13211,XVIII.,That swayed him onward with a secret pride
13212,XVIII.,To do what few or none would do beside;
13213,XVIII.,"And this same impulse would, in tempting time,"
13214,XVIII.,Mislead his spirit equally to crime;
13215,XVIII.,"So much he soared beyond, or sunk beneath,"
13216,XVIII.,"The men with whom he felt condemned to breathe,"
13217,XVIII.,And longed by good or ill to separate
13218,XVIII.,Himself from all who shared his mortal state;
13219,XVIII.,His mind abhorring this had fixed her throne
13220,XVIII.,"Far from the world, in regions of her own:                          350"
13221,XVIII.,"Thus coldly passing all that passed below,"
13222,XVIII.,His blood in temperate seeming now would flow:
13223,XVIII.,"Ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glowed,"
13224,XVIII.,But ever in that icy smoothness flowed!
13225,XVIII.,"'Tis true, with other men their path he walked,"
13226,XVIII.,"And like the rest in seeming did and talked,"
13227,XVIII.,"Nor outraged Reason's rules by flaw nor start,"
13228,XVIII.,"His Madness was not of the head, but heart;"
13229,XVIII.,"And rarely wandered in his speech, or drew"
13230,XVIII.,His thoughts so forth as to offend the view.                        360
13231,XVIII.,
13232,XIX.,XIX.
13233,XIX.,
13234,XIX.,"With all that chilling mystery of mien,"
13235,XIX.,"And seeming gladness to remain unseen,"
13236,XIX.,He had (if 'twere not nature's boon) an art
13237,XIX.,Of fixing memory on another's heart:
13238,XIX.,It was not love perchance--nor hate--nor aught
13239,XIX.,That words can image to express the thought;
13240,XIX.,"But they who saw him did not see in vain,"
13241,XIX.,And once beheld--would ask of him again:
13242,XIX.,"And those to whom he spake remembered well,"
13243,XIX.,"And on the words, however light, would dwell:                       370"
13244,XIX.,"None knew, nor how, nor why, but he entwined"
13245,XIX.,Himself perforce around the hearer's mind;[js]
13246,XIX.,"There he was stamped, in liking, or in hate,"
13247,XIX.,If greeted once; however brief the date
13248,XIX.,"That friendship, pity, or aversion knew,[jt]"
13249,XIX.,Still there within the inmost thought he grew.
13250,XIX.,"You could not penetrate his soul, but found,"
13251,XIX.,"Despite your wonder, to your own he wound;"
13252,XIX.,His presence haunted still; and from the breast[ju]
13253,XIX.,He forced an all unwilling interest:                                380
13254,XIX.,Vain was the struggle in that mental net--
13255,XIX.,His Spirit seemed to dare you to forget!
13256,XIX.,
13257,XX.,XX.
13258,XX.,
13259,XX.,"There is a festival, where knights and dames,"
13260,XX.,"And aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims,"
13261,XX.,Appear--a high-born and a welcome guest
13262,XX.,To Otho's hall came Lara with the rest.
13263,XX.,"The long carousal shakes the illumined hall,"
13264,XX.,Well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;
13265,XX.,And the gay dance of bounding Beauty's train
13266,XX.,Links grace and harmony in happiest chain:                          390
13267,XX.,Blest are the early hearts and gentle hands
13268,XX.,That mingle there in well according bands;
13269,XX.,"It is a sight the careful brow might smooth,"
13270,XX.,"And make Age smile, and dream itself to youth,"
13271,XX.,"And Youth forget such hour was past on earth,"
13272,XX.,So springs the exulting bosom to that mirth![jv]
13273,XX.,
13274,XXI.,XXI.
13275,XXI.,
13276,XXI.,"And Lara gazed on these, sedately glad,"
13277,XXI.,His brow belied him if his soul was sad;
13278,XXI.,"And his glance followed fast each fluttering fair,"
13279,XXI.,Whose steps of lightness woke no echo there:                        400
13280,XXI.,"He leaned against the lofty pillar nigh,"
13281,XXI.,"With folded arms and long attentive eye,"
13282,XXI.,Nor marked a glance so sternly fixed on his--
13283,XXI.,Ill brooked high Lara scrutiny like this:
13284,XXI.,"At length he caught it--'tis a face unknown,"
13285,XXI.,"But seems as searching his, and his alone;"
13286,XXI.,"Prying and dark, a stranger's by his mien,"
13287,XXI.,Who still till now had gazed on him unseen:
13288,XXI.,At length encountering meets the mutual gaze
13289,XXI.,"Of keen enquiry, and of mute amaze;                                 410"
13290,XXI.,"On Lara's glance emotion gathering grew,"
13291,XXI.,As if distrusting that the stranger threw;
13292,XXI.,"Along the stranger's aspect, fixed and stern,"
13293,XXI.,Flashed more than thence the vulgar eye could learn.
13294,XXI.,
13295,XXII.,XXII.
13296,XXII.,
13297,XXII.,"""'Tis he!"" the stranger cried, and those that heard"
13298,XXII.,Re-echoed fast and far the whispered word.
13299,XXII.,"""'Tis he!""--""'Tis who?"" they question far and near,"
13300,XXII.,Till louder accents rung on Lara's ear;
13301,XXII.,"So widely spread, few bosoms well could brook"
13302,XXII.,"The general marvel, or that single look:                            420"
13303,XXII.,"But Lara stirred not, changed not, the surprise"
13304,XXII.,That sprung at first to his arrested eyes
13305,XXII.,Seemed now subsided--neither sunk nor raised
13306,XXII.,"Glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;"
13307,XXII.,"And drawing nigh, exclaimed, with haughty sneer,"
13308,XXII.,"""'Tis he!--how came he thence?--what doth he here?"""
13309,XXII.,
13310,XXIII.,XXIII.
13311,XXIII.,
13312,XXIII.,It were too much for Lara to pass by
13313,XXIII.,"Such questions, so repeated fierce and high;[jw]"
13314,XXIII.,"With look collected, but with accent cold,"
13315,XXIII.,"More mildly firm than petulantly bold,                              430"
13316,XXIII.,"He turned, and met the inquisitorial tone--"
13317,XXIII.,"""My name is Lara--when thine own is known,"
13318,XXIII.,Doubt not my fitting answer to requite
13319,XXIII.,The unlooked for courtesy of such a knight.
13320,XXIII.,'Tis Lara!--further wouldst thou mark or ask?
13321,XXIII.,"I shun no question, and I wear no mask."""
13322,XXIII.,
13323,XXIII.,"""Thou _shunn'st_ no question! Ponder--is there none"
13324,XXIII.,"Thy heart must answer, though thine ear would shun?"
13325,XXIII.,And deem'st thou me unknown too? Gaze again!
13326,XXIII.,At least thy memory was not given in vain.                          440
13327,XXIII.,Oh! never canst thou cancel half her debt--

13329,XXIII.,With slow and searching glance upon his face
13330,XXIII.,"Grew Lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace"
13331,XXIII.,"They knew, or chose to know--with dubious look"
13332,XXIII.,"He deigned no answer, but his head he shook,"
13333,XXIII.,And half contemptuous turned to pass away;
13334,XXIII.,But the stern stranger motioned him to stay.
13335,XXIII.,
13336,XXIII.,"""A word!--I charge thee stay, and answer here"
13337,XXIII.,"To one, who, wert thou noble, were thy peer,                        450"
13338,XXIII.,"But as thou wast and art--nay, frown not, Lord,"
13339,XXIII.,"If false, 'tis easy to disprove the word--"
13340,XXIII.,"But as thou wast and art, on thee looks down,"

13346,XXIII.,"May hear the rest, nor venture to gainsay"
13347,XXIII.,"The wondrous tale no doubt thy tongue can tell,"
13348,XXIII.,Which thus begins so courteously and well.                          460
13349,XXIII.,"Let Otho cherish here his polished guest,"
13350,XXIII.,"To him my thanks and thoughts shall be expressed."""
13351,XXIII.,And here their wondering host hath interposed--
13352,XXIII.,"""Whate'er there be between you undisclosed,"

13354,XXIII.,The mirthful meeting with a wordy war.
13355,XXIII.,"If thou, Sir Ezzelin, hast aught to show"
13356,XXIII.,"Which it befits Count Lara's ear to know,"
13357,XXIII.,"To-morrow, here, or elsewhere, as may best"

13371,XXIII.,What answers Lara? to its centre shrunk
13372,XXIII.,"His soul, in deep abstraction sudden sunk;"
13373,XXIII.,"The words of many, and the eyes of all"
13374,XXIII.,"That there were gathered, seemed on him to fall;"
13375,XXIII.,"But his were silent, his appeared to stray"
13376,XXIII.,In far forgetfulness away--away--
13377,XXIII.,Alas! that heedlessness of all around

13384,XXIV.,Upon his brow no outward passion spoke;
13385,XXIV.,From his large eye no flashing anger broke;
13386,XXIV.,"Yet there was something fixed in that low tone,"
13387,XXIV.,"Which showed resolve, determined, though unknown."
13388,XXIV.,"He seized his cloak--his head he slightly bowed,"
13389,XXIV.,"And passing Ezzelin, he left the crowd;"
13390,XXIV.,"And, as he passed him, smiling met the frown"
13391,XXIV.,With which that Chieftain's brow would bear him down:
13392,XXIV.,"It was nor smile of mirth, nor struggling pride                     500"
13393,XXIV.,That curbs to scorn the wrath it cannot hide;
13394,XXIV.,But that of one in his own heart secure
13395,XXIV.,"Of all that he would do, or could endure."
13396,XXIV.,Could this mean peace? the calmness of the good?
13397,XXIV.,Or guilt grown old in desperate hardihood?
13398,XXIV.,"Alas! too like in confidence are each,"
13399,XXIV.,For man to trust to mortal look or speech;
13400,XXIV.,"From deeds, and deeds alone, may he discern"
13401,XXIV.,Truths which it wrings the unpractised heart to learn.
13402,XXIV.,
13403,XXV.,XXV.
13404,XXV.,
13405,XXV.,"And Lara called his page, and went his way--                        510"
13406,XXV.,Well could that stripling word or sign obey:
13407,XXV.,"His only follower from those climes afar,"
13408,XXV.,Where the Soul glows beneath a brighter star:
13409,XXV.,"For Lara left the shore from whence he sprung,"
13410,XXV.,"In duty patient, and sedate though young;"
13411,XXV.,"Silent as him he served, his faith appears"
13412,XXV.,"Above his station, and beyond his years."
13413,XXV.,"Though not unknown the tongue of Lara's land,"
13414,XXV.,In such from him he rarely heard command;
13415,XXV.,"But fleet his step, and clear his tones would come,                 520"
13416,XXV.,When Lara's lip breathed forth the words of home:
13417,XXV.,"Those accents, as his native mountains dear,"
13418,XXV.,"Awake their absent echoes in his ear,[jz]"
13419,XXV.,"Friends'--kindred's--parents'--wonted voice recall,"
13420,XXV.,"Now lost, abjured, for one--his friend, his all:"
13421,XXV.,For him earth now disclosed no other guide;

13423,XXV.,
13424,XXVI.,XXVI.
13425,XXVI.,
13426,XXVI.,"Light was his form, and darkly delicate"
13427,XXVI.,"That brow whereon his native sun had sate,"
13428,XXVI.,"But had not marred, though in his beams he grew,                    530"
13429,XXVI.,The cheek where oft the unbidden blush shone through;
13430,XXVI.,Yet not such blush as mounts when health would show
13431,XXVI.,All the heart's hue in that delighted glow;
13432,XXVI.,But 'twas a hectic tint of secret care
13433,XXVI.,That for a burning moment fevered there;
13434,XXVI.,And the wild sparkle of his eye seemed caught
13435,XXVI.,"From high, and lightened with electric thought,[ka]"
13436,XXVI.,Though its black orb those long low lashes' fringe
13437,XXVI.,Had tempered with a melancholy tinge;
13438,XXVI.,"Yet less of sorrow than of pride was there,                         540"
13439,XXVI.,"Or, if 'twere grief, a grief that none should share:"
13440,XXVI.,"And pleased not him the sports that please his age,"
13441,XXVI.,"The tricks of Youth, the frolics of the Page;"
13442,XXVI.,"For hours on Lara he would fix his glance,"
13443,XXVI.,As all-forgotten in that watchful trance;
13444,XXVI.,"And from his chief withdrawn, he wandered lone,"
13445,XXVI.,"Brief were his answers, and his questions none;"
13446,XXVI.,"His walk the wood, his sport some foreign book;"
13447,XXVI.,His resting-place the bank that curbs the brook:
13448,XXVI.,"He seemed, like him he served, to live apart                        550"
13449,XXVI.,"From all that lures the eye, and fills the heart;"
13450,XXVI.,"To know no brotherhood, and take from earth"
13451,XXVI.,No gift beyond that bitter boon--our birth.
13452,XXVI.,
13453,XXVII.,XXVII.
13454,XXVII.,
13455,XXVII.,"If aught he loved, 'twas Lara; but was shown"
13456,XXVII.,His faith in reverence and in deeds alone;
13457,XXVII.,"In mute attention; and his care, which guessed"
13458,XXVII.,"Each wish, fulfilled it ere the tongue expressed."
13459,XXVII.,"Still there was haughtiness in all he did,"
13460,XXVII.,A spirit deep that brooked not to be chid;
13461,XXVII.,"His zeal, though more than that of servile hands,[kb]               560"
13462,XXVII.,"In act alone obeys, his air commands;"
13463,XXVII.,As if 'twas Lara's less than _his_ desire
13464,XXVII.,"That thus he served, but surely not for hire."
13465,XXVII.,"Slight were the tasks enjoined him by his Lord,"
13466,XXVII.,"To hold the stirrup, or to bear the sword;"
13467,XXVII.,"To tune his lute, or, if he willed it more,[kc]"
13468,XXVII.,On tomes of other times and tongues to pore;
13469,XXVII.,"But ne'er to mingle with the menial train,"
13470,XXVII.,"To whom he showed nor deference nor disdain,"
13471,XXVII.,But that well-worn reserve which proved he knew                     570
13472,XXVII.,No sympathy with that familiar crew:
13473,XXVII.,"His soul, whate'er his station or his stem,"
13474,XXVII.,"Could bow to Lara, not descend to them."
13475,XXVII.,"Of higher birth he seemed, and better days,"
13476,XXVII.,"Nor mark of vulgar toil that hand betrays,"
13477,XXVII.,So femininely white it might bespeak
13478,XXVII.,"Another sex, when matched with that smooth cheek,"
13479,XXVII.,"But for his garb, and something in his gaze,"
13480,XXVII.,More wild and high than Woman's eye betrays;
13481,XXVII.,A latent fierceness that far more became                            580
13482,XXVII.,His fiery climate than his tender frame:
13483,XXVII.,"True, in his words it broke not from his breast,"
13484,XXVII.,But from his aspect might be more than guessed.[kd]
13485,XXVII.,"Kaled his name, though rumour said he bore"
13486,XXVII.,Another ere he left his mountain-shore;
13487,XXVII.,"For sometimes he would hear, however nigh,"
13488,XXVII.,"That name repeated loud without reply,"
13489,XXVII.,"As unfamiliar--or, if roused again,"
13490,XXVII.,"Start to the sound, as but remembered then;"
13491,XXVII.,"Unless 'twas Lara's wonted voice that spake,                        590"
13492,XXVII.,For then--ear--eyes--and heart would all awake.

13496,XXVIII.,"He had looked down upon the festive hall,"
13497,XXVIII.,And mark'd that sudden strife so marked of all:
13498,XXVIII.,And when the crowd around and near him told[ke]
13499,XXVIII.,"Their wonder at the calmness of the bold,"
13500,XXVIII.,Their marvel how the high-born Lara bore
13501,XXVIII.,"Such insult from a stranger, doubly sore,"
13502,XXVIII.,"The colour of young Kaled went and came,"
13503,XXVIII.,"The lip of ashes, and the cheek of flame;"
13504,XXVIII.,And o'er his brow the dampening heart-drops threw                   600
13505,XXVIII.,"The sickening iciness of that cold dew,"
13506,XXVIII.,That rises as the busy bosom sinks
13507,XXVIII.,With heavy thoughts from which Reflection shrinks.
13508,XXVIII.,"Yes--there be things which we must dream and dare,"
13509,XXVIII.,And execute ere thought be half aware:[277]
13510,XXVIII.,"Whate'er might Kaled's be, it was enow"
13511,XXVIII.,"To seal his lip, but agonise his brow."
13512,XXVIII.,He gazed on Ezzelin till Lara cast
13513,XXVIII.,That sidelong smile upon the knight he past;
13514,XXVIII.,"When Kaled saw that smile his visage fell,                          610"
13515,XXVIII.,As if on something recognised right well:
13516,XXVIII.,His memory read in such a meaning more
13517,XXVIII.,Than Lara's aspect unto others wore:
13518,XXVIII.,"Forward he sprung--a moment, both were gone,"
13519,XXVIII.,And all within that hall seemed left alone;
13520,XXVIII.,"Each had so fixed his eye on Lara's mien,"
13521,XXVIII.,"All had so mixed their feelings with that scene,"
13522,XXVIII.,That when his long dark shadow through the porch
13523,XXVIII.,"No more relieves the glare of yon high torch,"
13524,XXVIII.,"Each pulse beats quicker, and all bosoms seem                       620"
13525,XXVIII.,"To bound as doubting from too black a dream,"
13526,XXVIII.,"Such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,"
13527,XXVIII.,Because the worst is ever nearest truth.
13528,XXVIII.,"And they are gone--but Ezzelin is there,"
13529,XXVIII.,With thoughtful visage and imperious air;
13530,XXVIII.,But long remained not; ere an hour expired
13531,XXVIII.,"He waved his hand to Otho, and retired."

13535,XXIX.,"The crowd are gone, the revellers at rest;"

13538,XXIX.,"Where Joy subsides, and Sorrow sighs to sleep,"
13539,XXIX.,"And Man, o'erlaboured with his Being's strife,"
13540,XXIX.,Shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life:
13541,XXIX.,"There lie Love's feverish hope, and Cunning's guile,[kf]"
13542,XXIX.,"Hate's working brain, and lulled Ambition's wile;"
13543,XXIX.,"O'er each vain eye Oblivion's pinions wave,"
13544,XXIX.,And quenched Existence crouches in a grave.[kg]
13545,XXIX.,What better name may Slumber's bed become?
13546,XXIX.,"Night's sepulchre, the universal home,"
13547,XXIX.,"Where Weakness--Strength--Vice--Virtue--sunk supine,                640"

13549,XXIX.,"Glad for a while to heave unconscious breath,"
13550,XXIX.,"Yet wake to wrestle with the dread of Death,"
13551,XXIX.,And shun--though Day but dawn on ills increased--

13688,VI.,"Nor gout of blood, nor shred of mantle torn;"
13689,VI.,"Nor fall nor struggle hath defaced the grass,"

13692,VI.,"The bitter print of each convulsive nail,"

14188,XXIV.,Of Otho's lands and Lara's broad domain:
14189,XXIV.,He heard a tramp--a horse and horseman broke
14190,XXIV.,From out the wood--before him was a cloak

14202,XXIV.,As if even yet too much its surface showed;
14203,XXIV.,At once he started--stooped--around him strown
14204,XXIV.,The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone:
14205,XXIV.,"Of these the heaviest thence he gathered there,"

14208,XXIV.,Himself might safely mark what this might mean;
14209,XXIV.,"He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,"
14210,XXIV.,And something glittered starlike on the vest;

14212,XXIV.,"A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:[lb]"
14213,XXIV.,"It rose again, but indistinct to view,"
14214,XXIV.,"And left the waters of a purple hue,"

14216,XXIV.,Till ebbed the latest eddy it had raised;                          1230
14217,XXIV.,"Then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,"

14253,XXV.,As if she staunched anew some phantom's wound.[ld]

14550,FOOTNOTES:,near the church of _S. Pietro ad vincula_: several other persons being
14551,FOOTNOTES:,"present at the entertainment. A late hour approaching, and the cardinal"
14552,FOOTNOTES:,having reminded his brother that it was time to return to the apostolic
14553,FOOTNOTES:,"palace, they mounted their horses or mules, with only a few attendants,"
14554,FOOTNOTES:,"and proceeded together as far as the palace of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,"
14555,FOOTNOTES:,"when the duke informed the cardinal that, before he returned home, he"
14556,FOOTNOTES:,"had to pay a visit of pleasure. Dismissing therefore all his attendants,"
14557,FOOTNOTES:,"excepting his _staffiero_, or footman, and a person in a mask, who had"
14558,FOOTNOTES:,"paid him a visit whilst at supper, and who, during the space of a month"
14559,FOOTNOTES:,"or thereabouts, previous to this time, had called upon him almost daily"
14560,FOOTNOTES:,"at the apostolic palace, he took this person behind him on his mule, and"
14561,FOOTNOTES:,"proceeded to the street of the Jews, where he quitted his servant,"
14562,FOOTNOTES:,"directing him to remain there until a certain hour; when, if he did not"
14563,FOOTNOTES:,"return, he might repair to the palace. The duke then seated the person"
14564,FOOTNOTES:,"in the mask behind him, and rode I know not whither; but in that night"
14565,FOOTNOTES:,"he was assassinated, and thrown into the river. The servant, after"
14566,FOOTNOTES:,"having been dismissed, was also assaulted and mortally wounded; and"
14567,FOOTNOTES:,"although he was attended with great care, yet such was his situation,"
14568,FOOTNOTES:,that he could give no intelligible account of what had befallen his
14569,FOOTNOTES:,"master. In the morning, the duke not having returned to the palace, his"
14570,FOOTNOTES:,servants began to be alarmed; and one of them informed the pontiff of
14571,FOOTNOTES:,"the evening excursion of his sons, and that the duke had not yet made"
14572,FOOTNOTES:,his appearance. This gave the pope no small anxiety; but he conjectured
14573,FOOTNOTES:,that the duke had been attracted by some courtesan to pass the night
14574,FOOTNOTES:,"with her, and, not choosing to quit the house in open day, had waited"
14575,FOOTNOTES:,"till the following evening to return home. When, however, the evening"
14576,FOOTNOTES:,"arrived, and he found himself disappointed in his expectations, he"
14577,FOOTNOTES:,"became deeply afflicted, and began to make inquiries from different"
14578,FOOTNOTES:,"persons, whom he ordered to attend him for that purpose. Amongst these"
14579,FOOTNOTES:,"was a man named Giorgio Schiavoni, who, having discharged some timber"
14580,FOOTNOTES:,"from a bark in the river, had remained on board the vessel to watch it;"
14581,FOOTNOTES:,and being interrogated whether he had seen any one thrown into the river
14582,FOOTNOTES:,"on the night preceding, he replied, that he saw two men on foot, who"
14583,FOOTNOTES:,"came down the street, and looked diligently about to observe whether any"
14584,FOOTNOTES:,"person was passing. That seeing no one, they returned, and a short time"
14585,FOOTNOTES:,"afterwards two others came, and looked around in the same manner as the"
14586,FOOTNOTES:,"former: no person still appearing, they gave a sign to their companions,"
14587,FOOTNOTES:,"when a man came, mounted on a white horse, having behind him a dead"
14588,FOOTNOTES:,"body, the head and arms of which hung on one side, and the feet on the"
14589,FOOTNOTES:,"other side of the horse; the two persons on foot supporting the body, to"
14590,FOOTNOTES:,prevent its falling. They thus proceeded towards that part where the
14591,FOOTNOTES:,"filth of the city is usually discharged into the river, and turning the"
14592,FOOTNOTES:,"horse, with his tail towards the water, the two persons took the dead"
14593,FOOTNOTES:,"body by the arms and feet, and with all their strength flung it into the"
14594,FOOTNOTES:,river. The person on horseback then asked if they had thrown it in; to
14595,FOOTNOTES:,"which they replied, _Signor, si_ (yes, Sir). He then looked towards the"
14596,FOOTNOTES:,"river, and seeing a mantle floating on the stream, he enquired what it"
14597,FOOTNOTES:,"was that appeared black, to which they answered, it was a mantle; and"
14598,FOOTNOTES:,"one of them threw stones upon it, in consequence of which it sunk. The"
14599,FOOTNOTES:,"attendants of the pontiff then enquired from Giorgio, why he had not"
14600,FOOTNOTES:,"revealed this to the governor of the city; to which he replied, that he"
14601,FOOTNOTES:,had seen in his time a hundred dead bodies thrown into the river at the
14602,FOOTNOTES:,"same place, without any inquiry being made respecting them; and that he"
14603,FOOTNOTES:,"had not, therefore, considered it as a matter of any importance. The"
14604,FOOTNOTES:,"fishermen and seamen were then collected, and ordered to search the"
14605,FOOTNOTES:,"river, where, on the following evening, they found the body of the duke,"
14606,FOOTNOTES:,"with his habit entire, and thirty ducats in his purse. He was pierced"
14607,FOOTNOTES:,"with nine wounds, one of which was in his throat, the others in his"
14608,FOOTNOTES:,"head, body, and limbs. No sooner was the pontiff informed of the death"
14609,FOOTNOTES:,"of his son, and that he had been thrown, like filth, into the river,"
14610,FOOTNOTES:,"than, giving way to his grief, he shut himself up in a chamber, and wept"
14611,FOOTNOTES:,"bitterly. The Cardinal of Segovia, and other attendants on the pope,"
14612,FOOTNOTES:,"went to the door, and after many hours spent in persuasions and"
14613,FOOTNOTES:,"exhortations, prevailed upon him to admit them. From the evening of"
14614,FOOTNOTES:,Wednesday till the following Saturday the pope took no food; nor did he
14615,FOOTNOTES:,sleep from Thursday morning till the same hour on the ensuing day. At
14616,FOOTNOTES:,"length, however, giving way to the entreaties of his attendants, he"

17102,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"were preserved and repeated by the grandchildren of the besieged, and"
17103,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,were taken down from their lips. There is point and meaning in the

17107,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,the _Siege of Corinth_ is not a poetical expansion of a chapter in

17117,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,Finlay's newly discovered authority was a then unpublished MS. of a

17119,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"accompanied the Grand Vizier, Ali Cumurgi, as his interpreter, on the"
17120,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,expedition into the Morea. According to Brue (_Journal de la Campagne

17122,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,A peremptory demand on the part of the Grand Vizier to surrender at
17123,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"discretion was answered by the Venetian proveditor-general, Giacomo"

17128,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"threat, and on the 2nd of July the fortress capitulated. On the"
17129,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"following day at noon, whilst a party of Janissaries, contrary to order,"
17130,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"were looting and pillaging in all directions, the fortress was seen to"
17131,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,be enveloped in smoke. How or why the explosion happened was never
17132,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"discovered, but the result was that some of the pillaging Janissaries"
17133,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"perished, and that others, to avenge their death, which they attributed"
17134,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"to Venetian treachery, put the garrison to the sword. It was believed at"

17181,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,The copy of the MS. of the _Siege of Corinth_ was sent to Murray at the
17182,INTRODUCTION TO _THE SIEGE OF CORINTH_.,"beginning (probably on the 2nd, the date of the copy) of November, and"

17620,XII.,"Profuse of blood, untired in toil,"
17621,XII.,When battling on the parent soil.
17622,XII.,He stood alone--a renegade
17623,XII.,Against the country he betrayed;
17624,XII.,"He stood alone amidst his band,"
17625,XII.,Without a trusted heart or hand:
17626,XII.,"They followed him, for he was brave,                                310"
17627,XII.,And great the spoil he got and gave;
17628,XII.,"They crouched to him, for he had skill"
17629,XII.,To warp and wield the vulgar will:[ov]
17630,XII.,But still his Christian origin
17631,XII.,With them was little less than sin.
17632,XII.,They envied even the faithless fame
17633,XII.,He earned beneath a Moslem name;
17634,XII.,"Since he, their mightiest chief, had been"
17635,XII.,In youth a bitter Nazarene.
17636,XII.,"They did not know how Pride can stoop,                              320"
17637,XII.,When baffled feelings withering droop;
17638,XII.,They did not know how Hate can burn
17639,XII.,In hearts once changed from soft to stern;
17640,XII.,Nor all the false and fatal zeal
17641,XII.,The convert of Revenge can feel.
17642,XII.,"He ruled them--man may rule the worst,"
17643,XII.,By ever daring to be first:
17644,XII.,So lions o'er the jackals sway;

17660,XIII.,"Upon his eyes had slumber sate,"
17661,XIII.,"Without or couch or canopy,"

17674,XIII.,"A night of sleep, perchance their last,"

17684,XIV.,"Behind, the camp--before him lay,"
17685,XIV.,"In many a winding creek and bay,"
17686,XIV.,"Lepanto's gulf; and, on the brow"
17687,XIV.,"Of Delphi's hill, unshaken snow,[pa]"
17688,XIV.,"High and eternal, such as shone"

17695,XIV.,"Which on the mighty mount thou hailest,"
17696,XIV.,"While tower and tree are torn and rent,"
17697,XIV.,Shines o'er its craggy battlement;
17698,XIV.,"In form a peak, in height a cloud,"
17699,XIV.,"In texture like a hovering shroud,"
17700,XIV.,"Thus high by parting Freedom spread,"
17701,XIV.,"As from her fond abode she fled,"

17704,XIV.,Oh! still her step at moments falters
17705,XIV.,"O'er withered fields, and ruined altars,"

17759,XVI.,Heedless if she come or go:
17760,XVI.,"Calm or high, in main or bay,"
17761,XVI.,On their course she hath no sway.
17762,XVI.,"The rock unworn its base doth bare,"
17763,XVI.,"And looks o'er the surf, but it comes not there;"
17764,XVI.,"And the fringe of the foam may be seen below,"
17765,XVI.,On the line that it left long ages ago:
17766,XVI.,A smooth short space of yellow sand[pj][355]
17767,XVI.,Between it and the greener land.
17768,XVI.,
17769,XVI.,"He wandered on along the beach,                                     440"
17770,XVI.,Till within the range of a carbine's reach

17779,XVI.,"Though he heard the sound, and could almost tell                    450"
17780,XVI.,"The sullen words of the sentinel,"
17781,XVI.,As his measured step on the stone below
17782,XVI.,"Clanked, as he paced it to and fro;"
17783,XVI.,And he saw the lean dogs beneath the wall
17784,XVI.,"Hold o'er the dead their Carnival,[356]"
17785,XVI.,Gorging and growling o'er carcass and limb;
17786,XVI.,They were too busy to bark at him!
17787,XVI.,"From a Tartar's skull they had stripped the flesh,"
17788,XVI.,As ye peel the fig when its fruit is fresh;
17789,XVI.,"And their white tusks crunched o'er the whiter skull,[357]          460"
17790,XVI.,"As it slipped through their jaws, when their edge grew dull,"
17791,XVI.,"As they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead,"
17792,XVI.,When they scarce could rise from the spot where they fed;
17793,XVI.,So well had they broken a lingering fast
17794,XVI.,With those who had fallen for that night's repast.
17795,XVI.,"And Alp knew, by the turbans that rolled on the sand,"
17796,XVI.,The foremost of these were the best of his band:
17797,XVI.,"Crimson and green were the shawls of their wear,"
17798,XVI.,"And each scalp had a single long tuft of hair,[358]"
17799,XVI.,All the rest was shaven and bare.                                   470
17800,XVI.,"The scalps were in the wild dog's maw,"
17801,XVI.,The hair was tangled round his jaw:
17802,XVI.,"But close by the shore, on the edge of the gulf,"
17803,XVI.,"There sat a vulture flapping a wolf,"
17804,XVI.,"Who had stolen from the hills, but kept away,"
17805,XVI.,"Scared by the dogs, from the human prey;"
17806,XVI.,"But he seized on his share of a steed that lay,"

17809,XVII.,XVII.
17810,XVII.,
17811,XVII.,Alp turned him from the sickening sight:
17812,XVII.,Never had shaken his nerves in fight;                               480
17813,XVII.,"But he better could brook to behold the dying,"
17814,XVII.,"Deep in the tide of their warm blood lying,[pm][359]"
17815,XVII.,"Scorched with the death-thirst, and writhing in vain,"

17859,XIX.,"Was it the wind through some hollow stone,[ps]"
17860,XIX.,Sent that soft and tender moan?[365]
17861,XIX.,"He lifted his head, and he looked on the sea,"
17862,XIX.,But it was unrippled as glass may be;
17863,XIX.,He looked on the long grass--it waved not a blade;
17864,XIX.,How was that gentle sound conveyed?
17865,XIX.,"He looked to the banners--each flag lay still,"
17866,XIX.,"So did the leaves on Cithæron's hill,"
17867,XIX.,And he felt not a breath come over his cheek;

17972,XXI.,"As they seem, through the dimness, about to come down"
17973,XXI.,From the shadowy wall where their images frown;
17974,XXI.,"Fearfully flitting to and fro,"
17975,XXI.,As the gusts on the tapestry come and go.[370]

17977,XXI.,"""If not for love of me be given"
17978,XXI.,"Thus much, then, for the love of Heaven,--"
17979,XXI.,Again I say--that turban tear                                       630
17980,XXI.,"From off thy faithless brow, and swear"

17986,XXI.,"That doom shall half absolve thy sin,"
17987,XXI.,And Mercy's gate may receive thee within:[371]
17988,XXI.,"But pause one moment more, and take"
17989,XXI.,The curse of Him thou didst forsake;                                640
17990,XXI.,"And look once more to Heaven, and see"
17991,XXI.,Its love for ever shut from thee.
17992,XXI.,There is a light cloud by the moon--[372]
17993,XXI.,"'Tis passing, and will pass full soon--"

18000,XXI.,
18001,XXI.,"Alp looked to heaven, and saw on high"
18002,XXI.,The sign she spake of in the sky;
18003,XXI.,"But his heart was swollen, and turned aside,"
18004,XXI.,By deep interminable pride.[qc]
18005,XXI.,This first false passion of his breast
18006,XXI.,Rolled like a torrent o'er the rest.
18007,XXI.,_He_ sue for mercy! _He_ dismayed
18008,XXI.,By wild words of a timid maid!
18009,XXI.,"_He_, wronged by Venice, vow to save"

18011,XXI.,"No--though that cloud were thunder's worst,"
18012,XXI.,And charged to crush him--let it burst!
18013,XXI.,
18014,XXI.,"He looked upon it earnestly,"
18015,XXI.,Without an accent of reply;
18016,XXI.,He watched it passing; it is flown:
18017,XXI.,"Full on his eye the clear moon shone,"
18018,XXI.,"And thus he spake--""Whate'er my fate,"
18019,XXI.,I am no changeling--'tis too late:
18020,XXI.,"The reed in storms may bow and quiver,"
18021,XXI.,Then rise again; the tree must shiver.                              670
18022,XXI.,"What Venice made me, I must be,"
18023,XXI.,"Her foe in all, save love to thee:"

18025,XXI.,"He turned, but she is gone!"
18026,XXI.,Nothing is there but the column stone.

18039,XXII.,"And the flap of the banners, that flit as they're borne,"
18040,XXII.,"And the neigh of the steed, and the multitude's hum,"
18041,XXII.,"And the clash, and the shout, ""They come! they come!"""
18042,XXII.,"The horsetails[376] are plucked from the ground, and the sword"

18055,XXII.,The spears are uplifted; the matches are lit;
18056,XXII.,"The cannon are pointed, and ready to roar,"
18057,XXII.,And crush the wall they have crumbled before:[379]
18058,XXII.,Forms in his phalanx each Janizar;
18059,XXII.,"Alp at their head; his right arm is bare,"
18060,XXII.,So is the blade of his scimitar;
18061,XXII.,The Khan and the Pachas are all at their post;
18062,XXII.,The Vizier himself at the head of the host.
18063,XXII.,"When the culverin's signal is fired, then on;"
18064,XXII.,Leave not in Corinth a living one--                                 710
18065,XXII.,"A priest at her altars, a chief in her halls,"
18066,XXII.,"A hearth in her mansions, a stone on her walls."
18067,XXII.,God and the prophet--Alla Hu![380]

18072,XXII.,"His heart's dearest wish; let him ask it, and have!"""
18073,XXII.,"Thus uttered Coumourgi, the dauntless Vizier;[382]"
18074,XXII.,"The reply was the brandish of sabre and spear,                      720"
18075,XXII.,And the shout of fierce thousands in joyous ire:--

18088,XXIII.,"Many a bosom, sheathed in brass,"
18089,XXIII.,"Strewed the earth like broken glass,[qd]"

18092,XXIII.,"Even as they fell, in files they lay,"
18093,XXIII.,"Like the mower's grass at the close of day,[qe]"
18094,XXIII.,When his work is done on the levelled plain;

18096,XXIII.,
18097,XXIV.,XXIV.
18098,XXIV.,
18099,XXIV.,"As the spring-tides, with heavy plash,"

18101,XXIV.,"Huge fragments, sapped by the ceaseless flow,"
18102,XXIV.,"Till white and thundering down they go,"
18103,XXIV.,Like the avalanche's snow
18104,XXIV.,On the Alpine vales below;
18105,XXIV.,"Thus at length, outbreathed and worn,"
18106,XXIV.,Corinth's sons were downward borne

18109,XXIV.,"In firmness they stood, and in masses they fell,"

18111,XXIV.,"Hand to hand, and foot to foot:"
18112,XXIV.,"Nothing there, save Death, was mute;[385]"
18113,XXIV.,"Stroke, and thrust, and flash, and cry"
18114,XXIV.,"For quarter, or for victory,"
18115,XXIV.,"Mingle there with the volleying thunder,"
18116,XXIV.,Which makes the distant cities wonder
18117,XXIV.,"How the sounding battle goes,"
18118,XXIV.,"If with them, or for their foes;"
18119,XXIV.,"If they must mourn, or may rejoice"

18121,XXIV.,Which pierces the deep hills through and through
18122,XXIV.,With an echo dread and new:
18123,XXIV.,"You might have heard it, on that day,"
18124,XXIV.,O'er Salamis and Megara;
18125,XXIV.,"(We have heard the hearers say,)[qf]"

18128,XXV.,XXV.
18129,XXV.,
18130,XXV.,"From the point of encountering blades to the hilt,"
18131,XXV.,Sabres and swords with blood were gilt;[386]
18132,XXV.,"But the rampart is won, and the spoil begun,"
18133,XXV.,And all but the after carnage done.                                 770
18134,XXV.,Shriller shrieks now mingling come
18135,XXV.,From within the plundered dome:
18136,XXV.,"Hark to the haste of flying feet,"
18137,XXV.,That splash in the blood of the slippery street;
18138,XXV.,"But here and there, where 'vantage ground"
18139,XXV.,"Against the foe may still be found,"
18140,XXV.,"Desperate groups, of twelve or ten,"
18141,XXV.,"Make a pause, and turn again--"
18142,XXV.,"With banded backs against the wall,"
18143,XXV.,"Fiercely stand, or fighting fall.                                   780"
18144,XXV.,"There stood an old man[387]--his hairs were white,"

18146,XXV.,"So gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,"
18147,XXV.,"The dead before him, on that day,"
18148,XXV.,In a semicircle lay;
18149,XXV.,"Still he combated unwounded,"
18150,XXV.,"Though retreating, unsurrounded."
18151,XXV.,Many a scar of former fight
18152,XXV.,Lurked[388] beneath his corslet bright;
18153,XXV.,"But of every wound his body bore,                                   790"
18154,XXV.,Each and all had been ta'en before:
18155,XXV.,"Though agéd, he was so iron of limb,"
18156,XXV.,"Few of our youth could cope with him,"
18157,XXV.,"And the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,"
18158,XXV.,Outnumbered his thin hairs[389] of silver grey.
18159,XXV.,From right to left his sabre swept:
18160,XXV.,Many an Othman mother wept
18161,XXV.,"Sons that were unborn, when dipped[390]"
18162,XXV.,"His weapon first in Moslem gore,"
18163,XXV.,Ere his years could count a score.                                  800
18164,XXV.,Of all he might have been the sire[391]
18165,XXV.,Who fell that day beneath his ire:
18166,XXV.,"For, sonless left long years ago,"
18167,XXV.,His wrath made many a childless foe;
18168,XXV.,"And since the day, when in the strait[392]"
18169,XXV.,"His only boy had met his fate,"
18170,XXV.,His parent's iron hand did doom
18171,XXV.,More than a human hecatomb.[393]
18172,XXV.,"If shades by carnage be appeased,"
18173,XXV.,Patroclus' spirit less was pleased                                  810
18174,XXV.,"Than his, Minotti's son, who died"
18175,XXV.,Where Asia's bounds and ours divide.
18176,XXV.,"Buried he lay, where thousands before"
18177,XXV.,For thousands of years were inhumed on the shore;
18178,XXV.,"What of them is left, to tell"
18179,XXV.,"Where they lie, and how they fell?"
18180,XXV.,"Not a stone on their turf, nor a bone in their graves;"
18181,XXV.,But they live in the verse that immortally saves.[394]
18182,XXV.,
18183,XXVI.,XXVI.
18184,XXVI.,
18185,XXVI.,Hark to the Allah shout![395] a band
18186,XXVI.,Of the Mussulman bravest and best is at hand;                       820
18187,XXVI.,"Their leader's nervous arm is bare,"
18188,XXVI.,"Swifter to smite, and never to spare--"
18189,XXVI.,Unclothed to the shoulder it waves them on;
18190,XXVI.,Thus in the fight is he ever known:
18191,XXVI.,"Others a gaudier garb may show,"
18192,XXVI.,To tempt the spoil of the greedy foe;
18193,XXVI.,"Many a hand's on a richer hilt,"
18194,XXVI.,But none on a steel more ruddily gilt;
18195,XXVI.,"Many a loftier turban may wear,--"
18196,XXVI.,Alp is but known by the white arm bare;                             830
18197,XXVI.,"Look through the thick of the fight,'tis there!"
18198,XXVI.,There is not a standard on that shore
18199,XXVI.,So well advanced the ranks before;
18200,XXVI.,There is not a banner in Moslem war
18201,XXVI.,Will lure the Delhis half so far;
18202,XXVI.,It glances like a falling star!
18203,XXVI.,"Where'er that mighty arm is seen,"
18204,XXVI.,"The bravest be, or late have been;[396]"
18205,XXVI.,There the craven cries for quarter
18206,XXVI.,Vainly to the vengeful Tartar;                                      840
18207,XXVI.,"Or the hero, silent lying,"
18208,XXVI.,Scorns to yield a groan in dying;
18209,XXVI.,Mustering his last feeble blow
18210,XXVI.,"'Gainst the nearest levelled foe,"
18211,XXVI.,"Though faint beneath the mutual wound,"
18212,XXVI.,Grappling on the gory ground.
18213,XXVI.,
18214,XXVII.,XXVII.
18215,XXVII.,
18216,XXVII.,Still the old man stood erect.
18217,XXVII.,And Alp's career a moment checked.
18218,XXVII.,"""Yield thee, Minotti; quarter take,"
18219,XXVII.,"For thine own, thy daughter's sake.""                                850"
18220,XXVII.,
18221,XXVII.,"""Never, Renegado, never!"

18228,XXVII.,From whence thy traitor soul is driven--
18229,XXVII.,"Far from thee, and undefiled."""
18230,XXVII.,"Grimly then Minotti smiled,"
18231,XXVII.,As he saw Alp staggering bow
18232,XXVII.,"Before his words, as with a blow.                                   860"
18233,XXVII.,
18234,XXVII.,"""Oh God! when died she?""--""Yesternight--"
18235,XXVII.,Nor weep I for her spirit's flight:
18236,XXVII.,None of my pure race shall be
18237,XXVII.,Slaves to Mahomet and thee--
18238,XXVII.,"Come on!""--That challenge is in vain--"
18239,XXVII.,Alp's already with the slain!
18240,XXVII.,While Minotti's words were wreaking
18241,XXVII.,More revenge in bitter speaking
18242,XXVII.,"Than his falchion's point had found,"
18243,XXVII.,"Had the time allowed to wound,                                      870"
18244,XXVII.,From within the neighbouring porch
18245,XXVII.,"Of a long defended church,"
18246,XXVII.,Where the last and desperate few
18247,XXVII.,"Would the failing fight renew,"
18248,XXVII.,The sharp shot dashed Alp to the ground;
18249,XXVII.,Ere an eye could view the wound
18250,XXVII.,"That crashed through the brain of the infidel,"
18251,XXVII.,"Round he spun, and down he fell;"
18252,XXVII.,A flash like fire within his eyes
18253,XXVII.,"Blazed, as he bent no more to rise,                                 880"
18254,XXVII.,And then eternal darkness sunk
18255,XXVII.,Through all the palpitating trunk;[qi]
18256,XXVII.,"Nought of life left, save a quivering"
18257,XXVII.,Where his limbs were slightly shivering:
18258,XXVII.,They turned him on his back; his breast
18259,XXVII.,"And brow were stained with gore and dust,"
18260,XXVII.,"And through his lips the life-blood oozed,"
18261,XXVII.,From its deep veins lately loosed;
18262,XXVII.,"But in his pulse there was no throb,"
18263,XXVII.,Nor on his lips one dying sob;                                      890
18264,XXVII.,"Sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath[qj]"
18265,XXVII.,Heralded his way to death:
18266,XXVII.,"Ere his very thought could pray,"
18267,XXVII.,"Unaneled he passed away,"
18268,XXVII.,"Without a hope from Mercy's aid,--"
18269,XXVII.,To the last a Renegade.[397]
18270,XXVII.,
18271,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
18272,XXVIII.,
18273,XXVIII.,Fearfully the yell arose

18277,XXVIII.,"Clashing swords, and spears transfixing,"
18278,XXVIII.,"Interchanged the blow and thrust,"
18279,XXVIII.,Hurling warriors in the dust.
18280,XXVIII.,"Street by street, and foot by foot,"
18281,XXVIII.,Still Minotti dares dispute
18282,XXVIII.,The latest portion of the land
18283,XXVIII.,Left beneath his high command;
18284,XXVIII.,"With him, aiding heart and hand,"
18285,XXVIII.,The remnant of his gallant band.
18286,XXVIII.,"Still the church is tenable,                                        910"

18306,XXIX.,Where still the Christians yielded not;
18307,XXIX.,"And the foremost, if fearful, may vainly try"
18308,XXIX.,Through the massy column to turn and fly;

18310,XXIX.,"They die; but ere their eyes could close,"
18311,XXIX.,Avengers o'er their bodies rose;
18312,XXIX.,"Fresh and furious, fast they fill"

18866,XIX.,"Byron (_vide ante_, p. 443), in a letter to Coleridge, dated October 27,"

18868,XIX.,"plagiarism, by explaining that lines 521-532 of stanza xix. were written"
18869,XIX.,before he heard Walter Scott repeat _Christabel_ in the preceding June.
18870,XIX.,"Now, as Byron himself perceived, perhaps for the first time, when he had"
18871,XIX.,"the MS. of _Christabel_ before him, the coincidence in language and"
18872,XIX.,"style between the two passages is unquestionable; and, as he hoped and"
18873,XIX.,"expected that Coleridge's fragment, when completed, would issue from the"
18874,XIX.,"press, he was anxious to avoid even the semblance of pilfering, and went"
18875,XIX.,so far as to suggest that the passage should be cancelled. Neither in
18876,XIX.,the private letter nor the published note does Byron attempt to deny or
18877,XIX.,"explain away the coincidence, but pleads that his lines were written"
18878,XIX.,"before he had heard Coleridge's poem recited, and that he had not been"
18879,XIX.,"guilty of a ""wilful plagiarism."" There is no difficulty in accepting his"
18880,XIX.,"statement. Long before the summer of 1815 _Christabel_ ""had a pretty"
18881,XIX.,"general circulation in the literary world"" (Medwin, _Conversations_,"
18882,XIX.,"1824, p. 261), and he may have heard without heeding this and other"
18883,XIX.,"passages quoted by privileged readers; or, though never a line of"
18884,XIX.,"_Christabel_ had sounded in his ears, he may (as Kölbing points out)"

19368,ADVERTISEMENT.,The following poem is grounded on a circumstance mentioned in Gibbon's
19369,ADVERTISEMENT.,"""Antiquities of the House of Brunswick."" I am aware, that in modern"
19370,ADVERTISEMENT.,"times, the delicacy or fastidiousness of the reader may deem such"
19371,ADVERTISEMENT.,"subjects unfit for the purposes of poetry. The Greek dramatists, and"
19372,ADVERTISEMENT.,"some of the best of our old English writers, were of a different"
19373,ADVERTISEMENT.,"opinion: as Alfieri and Schiller have also been, more recently, upon the"
19374,ADVERTISEMENT.,Continent. The following extract will explain the facts on which the
19375,ADVERTISEMENT.,"story is founded. The name of _Azo_ is substituted for Nicholas, as more"
19376,ADVERTISEMENT.,metrical.--[B.]
19377,ADVERTISEMENT.,
19378,ADVERTISEMENT.,"""Under the reign of Nicholas III. [A.D. 1425] Ferrara was polluted with"
19379,ADVERTISEMENT.,"a domestic tragedy. By the testimony of a maid, and his own observation,"
19380,ADVERTISEMENT.,the Marquis of Este discovered the incestuous loves of his wife
19381,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Parisina, and Hugo his bastard son, a beautiful and valiant youth. They"
19382,ADVERTISEMENT.,"were beheaded in the castle by the sentence of a father and husband, who"
19383,ADVERTISEMENT.,"published his shame, and survived their execution.[411] He was"
19384,ADVERTISEMENT.,"unfortunate, if they were guilty: if they were innocent, he was still"
19385,ADVERTISEMENT.,more unfortunate; nor is there any possible situation in which I can

19527,VII.,"Which, had she roused her from her trance,"
19528,VII.,Had frozen her sense to sleep again;
19529,VII.,And o'er his brow the burning lamp
19530,VII.,Gleamed on the dew-drops big and damp.

19544,VIII.,All circumstance which may compel
19545,VIII.,Full credence to the tale they tell:

19572,X.,"Glanced gladness round the glittering room,                       150"
19573,X.,Where high-born men were proud to wait--
19574,X.,Where Beauty watched to imitate
19575,X.,Her gentle voice--her lovely mien--

19614,XI.,But yet he dared not look on her;
19615,XI.,Remembrance of the hours that were--                                190

19625,XII.,
19626,XII.,"And Azo spake:--""But yesterday"

19629,XII.,"Ere day declines, I shall have none."
19630,XII.,My life must linger on alone;
19631,XII.,"Well,--let that pass,--there breathes not one"

19633,XII.,Those ties are broken--not by me;

19639,XII.,Learn if thou there canst be forgiven:
19640,XII.,Its mercy may absolve thee yet.
19641,XII.,"But here, upon the earth beneath,"
19642,XII.,There is no spot where thou and I

19656,XIII.,Throbbed as if back upon his brain
19657,XIII.,The hot blood ebbed and flowed again;
19658,XIII.,"And therefore bowed he for a space,"

19660,XIII.,"His eye, to veil it from the throng;"

19662,XIII.,And for a brief delay demands
19663,XIII.,His father's ear: the silent sire
19664,XIII.,Forbids not what his words require.
19665,XIII.,"""It is not that I dread the death--"

19695,XIII.,My name should more than Este's shine
19696,XIII.,With honours all my own.
19697,XIII.,I had a sword--and have a breast
19698,XIII.,That should have won as haught[420] a crest

19726,XIII.,Repaid thee with too like a son!
19727,XIII.,"I am no bastard in my soul,"

19752,XIV.,"He ceased--and stood with folded arms,"
19753,XIV.,On which the circling fetters sounded;
19754,XIV.,"And not an ear but felt as wounded,                               320"
19755,XIV.,"Of all the chiefs that there were ranked,"
19756,XIV.,When those dull chains in meeting clanked:
19757,XIV.,Till Parisina's fatal charms[423]
19758,XIV.,Again attracted every eye--
19759,XIV.,Would she thus hear him doomed to die!
19760,XIV.,"She stood, I said, all pale and still,"
19761,XIV.,The living cause of Hugo's ill:
19762,XIV.,"Her eyes unmoved, but full and wide,"
19763,XIV.,Not once had turned to either side--
19764,XIV.,"Nor once did those sweet eyelids close,                             330"
19765,XIV.,"Or shade the glance o'er which they rose,"
19766,XIV.,But round their orbs of deepest blue
19767,XIV.,The circling white dilated grew--
19768,XIV.,And there with glassy gaze she stood
19769,XIV.,As ice were in her curdled blood;
19770,XIV.,But every now and then a tear[424]
19771,XIV.,So large and slowly gathered slid
19772,XIV.,"From the long dark fringe of that fair lid,"
19773,XIV.,"It was a thing to see, not hear![425]"
19774,XIV.,"And those who saw, it did surprise,                                 340"
19775,XIV.,Such drops could fall from human eyes.
19776,XIV.,To speak she thought--the imperfect note
19777,XIV.,"Was choked within her swelling throat,"
19778,XIV.,Yet seemed in that low hollow groan
19779,XIV.,Her whole heart gushing in the tone.
19780,XIV.,"It ceased--again she thought to speak,"
19781,XIV.,"Then burst her voice in one long shriek,"
19782,XIV.,And to the earth she fell like stone
19783,XIV.,"Or statue from its base o'erthrown,"
19784,XIV.,"More like a thing that ne'er had life,--                            350"
19785,XIV.,"A monument of Azo's wife,--"
19786,XIV.,"Than her, that living guilty thing,"
19787,XIV.,"Whose every passion was a sting,"
19788,XIV.,"Which urged to guilt, but could not bear"
19789,XIV.,That guilt's detection and despair.
19790,XIV.,But yet she lived--and all too soon
19791,XIV.,Recovered from that death-like swoon--
19792,XIV.,But scarce to reason--every sense
19793,XIV.,Had been o'erstrung by pangs intense;
19794,XIV.,And each frail fibre of her brain                                   360
19795,XIV.,"(As bowstrings, when relaxed by rain,"
19796,XIV.,The erring arrow launch aside)
19797,XIV.,Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide--
19798,XIV.,"The past a blank, the future black,"
19799,XIV.,"With glimpses of a dreary track,"
19800,XIV.,"Like lightning on the desert path,"
19801,XIV.,When midnight storms are mustering wrath.
19802,XIV.,She feared--she felt that something ill
19803,XIV.,"Lay on her soul, so deep and chill;"
19804,XIV.,"That there was sin and shame she knew,                              370"
19805,XIV.,That some one was to die--but who?
19806,XIV.,She had forgotten:--did she breathe?
19807,XIV.,"Could this be still the earth beneath,"
19808,XIV.,"The sky above, and men around;"
19809,XIV.,Or were they fiends who now so frowned
19810,XIV.,"On one, before whose eyes each eye"
19811,XIV.,Till then had smiled in sympathy?
19812,XIV.,All was confused and undefined
19813,XIV.,To her all-jarred and wandering mind;
19814,XIV.,A chaos of wild hopes and fears:                                    380
19815,XIV.,"And now in laughter, now in tears,"
19816,XIV.,"But madly still in each extreme,"
19817,XIV.,She strove with that convulsive dream;
19818,XIV.,For so it seemed on her to break:
19819,XIV.,Oh! vainly must she strive to wake!
19820,XIV.,
19821,XV.,XV.
19822,XV.,
19823,XV.,"The Convent bells are ringing,"
19824,XV.,But mournfully and slow;
19825,XV.,"In the grey square turret swinging,"
19826,XV.,"With a deep sound, to and fro."
19827,XV.,Heavily to the heart they go!                                     390

19829,XV.,"The song for the dead below,"
19830,XV.,Or the living who shortly shall be so!
19831,XV.,For a departed being's soul[rc]
19832,XV.,The death-hymn peals and the hollow bells knoll:[426]
19833,XV.,He is near his mortal goal;
19834,XV.,"Kneeling at the Friar's knee,"
19835,XV.,"Sad to hear, and piteous to see--"
19836,XV.,Kneeling on the bare cold ground.
19837,XV.,With the block before and the guards around;                        400
19838,XV.,"And the headsman with his bare arm ready,"
19839,XV.,"That the blow may be both swift and steady,"
19840,XV.,Feels if the axe be sharp and true
19841,XV.,Since he set its edge anew:[427]
19842,XV.,While the crowd in a speechless circle gather
19843,XV.,To see the Son fall by the doom of the Father!
19844,XV.,
19845,XVI.,XVI.
19846,XVI.,
19847,XVI.,It is a lovely hour as yet
19848,XVI.,"Before the summer sun shall set,"
19849,XVI.,"Which rose upon that heavy day,"
19850,XVI.,And mock'd it with his steadiest ray;                               410
19851,XVI.,And his evening beams are shed
19852,XVI.,"Full on Hugo's fated head,"
19853,XVI.,As his last confession pouring
19854,XVI.,"To the monk, his doom deploring"
19855,XVI.,"In penitential holiness,"
19856,XVI.,He bends to hear his accents bless
19857,XVI.,With absolution such as may
19858,XVI.,Wipe our mortal stains away.
19859,XVI.,That high sun on his head did glisten
19860,XVI.,"As he there did bow and listen,                                     420"
19861,XVI.,And the rings of chestnut hair
19862,XVI.,Curled half down his neck so bare;
19863,XVI.,But brighter still the beam was thrown
19864,XVI.,Upon the axe which near him shone
19865,XVI.,With a clear and ghastly glitter----
19866,XVI.,Oh! that parting hour was bitter!
19867,XVI.,Even the stern stood chilled with awe:
19868,XVI.,"Dark the crime, and just the law--"
19869,XVI.,Yet they shuddered as they saw.

19875,XVII.,"His beads and sins are all recounted,[rd]"
19876,XVII.,His hours to their last minute mounted;
19877,XVII.,"His mantling cloak before was stripped,"
19878,XVII.,His bright brown locks must now be clipped;
19879,XVII.,'Tis done--all closely are they shorn;
19880,XVII.,The vest which till this moment worn--
19881,XVII.,The scarf which Parisina gave--
19882,XVII.,Must not adorn him to the grave.
19883,XVII.,"Even that must now be thrown aside,                                 440"
19884,XVII.,And o'er his eyes the kerchief tied;
19885,XVII.,But no--that last indignity
19886,XVII.,Shall ne'er approach his haughty eye.
19887,XVII.,"All feelings seemingly subdued,"
19888,XVII.,"In deep disdain were half renewed,"
19889,XVII.,When headsman's hands prepared to bind
19890,XVII.,"Those eyes which would not brook such blind,"
19891,XVII.,As if they dared not look on death.
19892,XVII.,"""No--yours my forfeit blood and breath;"
19893,XVII.,"These hands are chained, but let me die                             450"
19894,XVII.,At least with an unshackled eye--
19895,XVII.,"Strike:""--and as the word he said,"
19896,XVII.,Upon the block he bowed his head;
19897,XVII.,These the last accents Hugo spoke:
19898,XVII.,"""Strike""--and flashing fell the stroke--"
19899,XVII.,"Rolled the head--and, gushing, sunk"
19900,XVII.,"Back the stained and heaving trunk,"
19901,XVII.,"In the dust, which each deep vein"
19902,XVII.,Slaked with its ensanguined rain;
19903,XVII.,"His eyes and lips a moment quiver,                                  460"
19904,XVII.,Convulsed and quick--then fix for ever.
19905,XVII.,
19906,XVII.,"He died, as erring man should die,"
19907,XVII.,"Without display, without parade;"
19908,XVII.,"Meekly had he bowed and prayed,"
19909,XVII.,"As not disdaining priestly aid,"
19910,XVII.,Nor desperate of all hope on high.
19911,XVII.,"And while before the Prior kneeling,"
19912,XVII.,His heart was weaned from earthly feeling;
19913,XVII.,His wrathful Sire--his Paramour--
19914,XVII.,What were they in such an hour?                                     470

19918,XVII.,"When, bared to meet the headsman's stroke,"
19919,XVII.,"He claimed to die with eyes unbound,"

19923,XVIII.,
19924,XVIII.,"Still as the lips that closed in death,"

19927,XVIII.,"A cold electric[428] shiver ran,                                    480"
19928,XVIII.,As down the deadly blow descended
19929,XVIII.,On him whose life and love thus ended;
19930,XVIII.,"And, with a hushing sound compressed,"
19931,XVIII.,A sigh shrunk back on every breast;
19932,XVIII.,"But no more thrilling noise rose there,[re]"
19933,XVIII.,Beyond the blow that to the block
19934,XVIII.,"Pierced through with forced and sullen shock,"
19935,XVIII.,Save one:--what cleaves the silent air
19936,XVIII.,"So madly shrill, so passing wild?"

19941,XVIII.,"Through Azo's palace-lattice driven,"

19943,XVIII.,And every eye is turned thereon;
19944,XVIII.,But sound and sight alike are gone!
19945,XVIII.,It was a woman's shriek--and ne'er
19946,XVIII.,In madlier accents rose despair;

19957,XIX.,Like words of wantonness or fear;
19958,XIX.,"And from Prince Azo's voice, by none"

19965,XIX.,"Whether in convent she abode,"

19968,XIX.,"Of scourge, and fast, and sleepless tears;"

19971,XIX.,"Or if, upon the moment smote,"
19972,XIX.,"She died by tortures less remote,"
19973,XIX.,Like him she saw upon the block
19974,XIX.,"With heart that shared the headsman's shock,"
19975,XIX.,"In quickened brokenness that came,"

20442,M.].,The testimony of the press is instructive from two points of view. In
20443,M.].,"the first place, it tends to show that the controversy was conducted on"

20445,M.].,some degree responsible for the wide diffusion and lasting publicity of
20446,M.].,"the scandal. The separation of Lord and Lady Byron must, in any case,"
20447,M.].,"have been more than a nine days' wonder, but if the circulation of the"

20455,M.].,"editor, who had recently (February 16, 1821) been killed in a duel. He"
20456,M.].,"does not minimize the wrong, but he pays a fine and generous tribute to"
