47,I.,I.
48,I.,
49,I.,Up with the country's flag!
50,I.,"And let the winds caress it, fold on fold,--"
51,I.,"A stainless flag, and glorious to behold!"
52,I.,It is our honour's pledge;
53,I.,"It is the token of a truth sublime,"
54,I.,"A thing to die for, and to wonder at,"
55,I.,"When, on the shuddering edge"
56,I.,"Of some great storm, it waves its woven joy,"
57,I.,"Which no man shall destroy,"
58,I.,"In shine or shower, in peace or battle-time."
59,I.,Up with the flag!
60,I.,"The winds are wild to toss it, and to brag"
61,I.,"Of England's high renown,--"
62,I.,And of the throne where Chivalry has sat
63,I.,Acclaimed in bower and town
64,I.,For England's high renown!--
65,I.,And of these happy isles where men are free
66,I.,"And masters of the sea,"
67,I.,"The million-mouthëd sea,"
68,I.,That calls to us from shore to furthest shore--
69,I.,"That fought for us of yore,--"
70,I.,"The thunder-throated, foam-frequented sea"
71,I.,That sounds the psalm of Victory evermore!
72,I.,
73,I.,
74,II.,II.
75,II.,
76,II.,"For England's sake to-day,--"
77,II.,"And for this flag of ours which, to the blast,"
78,II.,"Unfurls, in proud array,"
79,II.,"Its glittering width of splendour unsurpassed,--"
80,II.,"For England's sake,"
81,II.,"For our dear Sovereign's sake,--"
82,II.,"We cry all shame on traitors, high and low,"
83,II.,"Whose word let no man take,"
84,II.,"Whose love let no man seek throughout the land,--"
85,II.,"Traitors who strive, with most degenerate hand,"
86,II.,To bring about our country's overthrow!
87,II.,
88,II.,
89,III.,III.
90,III.,
91,III.,"The sun reels up the sky, the mists are gone,"
92,III.,And overhead the lilting bird of dawn
93,III.,"Has spread, adoring-wise, as for a prayer,"
94,III.,"Those wondrous wings of his,"
95,III.,Which never yet were symbols of despair!
96,III.,It is the feathery foeman of the night
97,III.,Who shakes adown the air
98,III.,Song-scented trills and sunlit ecstasies.
99,III.,"Aye! 'tis the lark, the chorister in gray,"
100,III.,"Who sings hosannas to the lord of light,"
101,III.,And will not stint the measure of his lay
102,III.,"As hour to hour, and joy to joy, succeeds;"
103,III.,"For he's the morning-mirth of English meads,"
104,III.,"And we who mark the moving of his wings,"
105,III.,"We know how sweet the soil whereof he sings,--"
106,III.,"How glad the grass, how green the summer's thrall,"
107,III.,How like a gracious garden the dear Land
108,III.,That loves the ocean and the tossed-up sand
109,III.,Whereof the wind has made a coronal;
110,III.,"And how, in spring and summer, at sun-rise,"
111,III.,"The birds fling out their raptures to the skies,"
112,III.,And have the grace of God upon them all.
113,III.,
114,III.,
115,IV.,IV.
116,IV.,
117,IV.,Up with the flag!
118,IV.,"Up, up, betimes, and proudly speak of it;"
119,IV.,"A lordly thing to see on tower and crag,"
120,IV.,"O'er which,--as eagles flit,"
121,IV.,"With eyes a-fire, and wings of phantasy,--"
122,IV.,Our memories hang superb!
123,IV.,The foes we frown upon shall feel the curb
124,IV.,Of our full sway; and they shall shaméd be
125,IV.,"Who wrong, with sword or pen,"
126,IV.,The Code that keeps us free.
127,IV.,"For there's no sight, in summer or in spring,"
128,IV.,"Like our great standard-pole,"
129,IV.,When round about it ring
130,IV.,"The cheers of Britons, bounden, heart and soul,"
131,IV.,"To deeds of duty, dear to Englishmen;"
132,IV.,And he who serves it has a name to see
133,IV.,On Victory's muster-roll;
134,IV.,"And he who loves it not, how vile is he!"
135,IV.,"For 'tis the Land's delight,--"
136,IV.,"Our ocean-wonder, blue and red and white;"
137,IV.,"Blue as the skies, and red as roses are,"
138,IV.,And white as foam that flashed at Trafalgàr;
139,IV.,The Land's delight!
140,IV.,"The badge and test of right,"
141,IV.,Girt with its glory like a guiding-star!
142,IV.,
143,IV.,
144,V.,V.
145,V.,
146,V.,"The wind has roared in English many a time,"
147,V.,"And foes have heard it on the frothy main,"
148,V.,In doom and danger and in battle-pain;
149,V.,"And yet again may hear,"
150,V.,"In many a sea-ward, sun-enamoured clime;"
151,V.,For all the hearts of traitors ache with fear
152,V.,"When our great ships go forth, as heretofore,"
153,V.,"Full-arméd from the shore,--"
154,V.,"And Boreas bounds exultant on the seas,"
155,V.,"To bid the waves of these,--"
156,V.,"The subject-waves of England and the Isles,--"
157,V.,"Out-leap for miles and miles,"
158,V.,As loud as lions loosed on enemies!
159,V.,
160,V.,
161,VI.,VI.
162,VI.,
163,VI.,"Oh, may no mean surrender of the rights"
164,VI.,"Of our ancestral swords,"
165,VI.,"Which made our fathers pioneers and lords,"
166,VI.,"And victors in the fights,--"
167,VI.,May no succession of the days and nights
168,VI.,"Find us or ours at fault,"
169,VI.,"Or careless of our fame, our island-fame,"
170,VI.,"Our sea-begotten fame,--"
171,VI.,And no true Briton halt
172,VI.,In his allegiance to the Victory-name
173,VI.,"Which is the name we bow to in our thought,"
174,VI.,"Where English deeds are wrought,"
175,VI.,"In lands that love the languors of the sun,"
176,VI.,"And where the stars have sway,"
177,VI.,And where the moon is marvelled at for hours!
178,VI.,"The flags of nations are the ocean-flowers,"
179,VI.,"And ours the dearest, ours the brightest one,"
180,VI.,That ever shimmered on the watery way
181,VI.,Which patriots call to mind
182,VI.,When they remember isles beyond the dawn
183,VI.,Where our sea-children dwell.
184,VI.,For there's no flag afloat upon the wind
185,VI.,"Can wave so high, or show so fair a front,"
186,VI.,"Or gleam so proudly in the battle-brunt,"
187,VI.,Or tell a tale of conquest half so well
188,VI.,As this we doat upon!
189,VI.,
190,VI.,
191,VII.,VII.
192,VII.,
193,VII.,"The storm is our ally, the raging sea"
194,VII.,"Is our adherent, and, to make us free,"
195,VII.,A thousand times the full-tongued hurricane
196,VII.,Has bellowed forth its menace o'er the deep;
197,VII.,"And when dissensions sleep,"
198,VII.,When sleep the wrought-up rancours of the age
199,VII.,"We shall again inscribe, and yet again,"
200,VII.,On History's glowing page
201,VII.,"The story of the flag,--"
202,VII.,For 'twas our Nelson's flag
203,VII.,"Which none in all the world shall put to shame,"
204,VII.,"Or vilify, or blame,--"
205,VII.,The story of the glory of the flag
206,VII.,"Which waved at Waterloo,"
207,VII.,"And was, from first to last, the symbol true"
208,VII.,Of Wellington's pure fame!
209,VII.,
210,VII.,
211,VIII.,VIII.
212,VIII.,
213,VIII.,"High, high the flag, for England's sake and ours,"
214,VIII.,"Who know its vested powers,"
215,VIII.,"And what it means, in war time, and in peace"
216,VIII.,"When fierce dissensions cease,--"
217,VIII.,"High, high the flag of England over all"
218,VIII.,Which nought but good befall!
219,VIII.,"High let it wave, in triumph, as a sign"
220,VIII.,"Of Freedom's right divine,--"
221,VIII.,"Its glorious folds out-fluttering in the gale,"
222,VIII.,Again to tell the tale
223,VIII.,"Of deeds heroic, wrought at Duty's call!"
224,VIII.,"The wind's our trumpeter; and east and west,"
225,VIII.,"And north and south, all day, as on a quest"
226,VIII.,"Of mirth and marvel,--all the live-long day"
227,VIII.,It bears the news about
228,VIII.,"Of all we do and dare, in our degree,"
229,VIII.,"And all the land's great shout,"
230,VIII.,And all the pomp and pageant of the Sea!

254,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",given forth utterances so suited to their good health or malady. Here a
255,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",verse to cheer the almost hopeless; a stanza to teach the refraining a
256,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","lesson in charge and capture; lines to fall in love with the memory, to"
257,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","charm the darkness, and be another light to rule the day. London was"
258,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","yawning behind her giant hand. The moment was propitious, and any strain"
259,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",of beauty was sure of an audience. At this felicitous moment a pipe of
260,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",splendour sounded. London ceased to yawn. A violinist was communicating
261,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","the passions of his heart to those who would listen, and amid great"
262,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",interest he went from house to house a-singing.... Eric Mackay is one of
263,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",those wise men who have no immature volumes to haunt them. He first
264,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",asked right of way on the road to Parnassus with a bundle of melodies
265,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","which have never lost their appeal. While youth seeks the pink cheek,"
266,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",these Love Letters will command the homage of lovers. Your Petrarchs are
267,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",not as common as sparrows.... These outpourings from a burning heart
268,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","will always compel the student of our literature to weigh them, sift"
269,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","them, and establish them in some very honourable position. The charm of"
270,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",this early book is its freedom from drag. It moves on always. The reader
271,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","is hastened along; he has wonderful and unexpected views, which ravish"
272,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",him as the abrupt magnificences of the Pyrenees ravished Gautier.
273,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","Perhaps you expect a tree, but you see a stream. Now, at last, it must"
274,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","be a great green hill, and behold! you peep down into an echoless mossy"
275,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","depth of glen. At the next break in the quick, up towers a height of"
276,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",fancy and simile! Thus the everlasting surprise goes on enchanting. From
277,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","wild to wild, from passion to passion, from cavern to star, are we"
278,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","borne, and as we travel there is music about us--music of the true tone,"
279,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",ringing with all the natural pathos of lyrical carelessness. There have
280,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","been instances in literature of the music mastering the thought, but in"
281,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",the case under notice the proportions are justly ministered to. There is
282,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",thought and witchery of measure. The ice of craftsmanship is mingled
283,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","with the wine of passion.""--NORMAN GALE, in _The Literary World_, March"

289,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","peculiar gracefulness and impassioned beauty. In my opinion, this is a"
290,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","better production than either of Wordsworth's, superior to Hogg's, and,"
291,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","though not so intellectual as Shelley's, rivals it in truth. Mackay's is"
292,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","the lark itself, Shelley's is himself listening, with unwearied ears and"
293,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","tightly-stretched imagination, to the lark. Who is surprised that Eric"
294,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","Mackay's lyric, 'The Waking of the Lark,' sent a thrill through the"
295,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","heart of America? This poem, which appeared in the _New York"
296,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","Independent_, is undoubtedly the lark-poem of the future. From the"
297,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","opening to the closing stanza there is not an imperfect verse, not a"
298,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","commonplace. The sentiment is pure, and the fancy glowing. It is,"
299,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","indeed, an exquisite ode.""--_Wintringham's_ ""_Birds of Wordsworth._"""

305,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",new poet. His published volume is a work of immense promise. His fancy
306,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","is splendid.... The 'Love Letters' are twelve poems, separate, and yet"
307,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","intrinsically one. It is a compound lyric, with an epic theme and"
308,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",somewhat of an epic cast. The theme is the triumph of woman's love. It
309,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","is the story of love's redemption. It has something of the tone, colour,"
310,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","and luxuriance of Solomon's Song; both, too, have the same theme,"
311,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",though treated in a different way.... The form is charming--as if the
312,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",sonatas of Beethoven had been translated into poetry! The _dénouement_
313,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",is reached when Beethoven himself--

325,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",metrical artist and poet born.... A beautiful and passionate work; its
326,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","beauty that of construction, language, imagery,--its passion,"
327,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","characteristic of the artistic nature, and, while intensely human, free"

329,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",manner Elizabethan.... Eric Mackay is a lyrist with a singing faculty
330,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.",and a novel metrical form such as few lyrists have at command. With the
331,"LONDON: LAMLEY & CO., EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.","very striking poem of 'Mary Arden,' we have at last something new said"
