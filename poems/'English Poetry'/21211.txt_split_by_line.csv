190,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,Forth into the warm darkness faring wide--
191,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,More silent momently the silent quay--
192,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,"Towards where the ranks of boats rock to the tide,"
193,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,Muffling their plaintive gurgling jealously.
194,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,

208,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,And passing fishers through the darkness call
209,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,
210,TO ROBERT HARBOROUGH SHERARD,"Deep greeting, in the jargon of the sea."

230,I,I
231,I,
232,I,I dreamed I was a barber; and there went
233,I,"Beneath my hand, oh! manes extravagant."
234,I,"Beneath my trembling fingers, many a mask"
235,I,Of many a pleasant girl. It was my task
236,I,"To gild their hair, carefully, strand by strand;"
237,I,To paint their eyebrows with a timid hand;
238,I,"To draw a bodkin, from a vase of kohl,"
239,I,Through the closed lashes; pencils from a bowl
240,I,Of sepia to paint them underneath;
241,I,To blow upon their eyes with a soft breath.
242,I,They lay them back and watched the leaping bands.

245,II,
246,II,The dream grew vague. I moulded with my hands
247,II,"The mobile breasts, the valley; and the waist"
248,II,I touched; and pigments reverently placed
249,II,"Upon their thighs in sapient spots and stains,"
250,II,"Beryls and crysolites and diaphanes,"
251,II,And gems whose hot harsh names are never said.
252,II,I was a masseur; and my fingers bled
253,II,With wonder as I touched their awful limbs.
254,II,
255,III,III
256,III,
257,III,"Suddenly, in the marble trough, there seems"
258,III,"O, last of my pale, mistresses, Sweetness!"
259,III,A twylipped scarlet pansie. My caress
260,III,Tinges thy steelgray eyes to violet.
261,III,Adown thy body skips the pit-a-pat
262,III,Of treatment once heard in a hospital
263,III,"For plagues that fascinate, but half appal."
264,III,
265,IV,IV
266,IV,
267,IV,"So, at the sound, the blood of me stood cold."
268,IV,Thy chaste hair ripened into sullen gold.
269,IV,"The throat, the shoulders, swelled and were uncouth."
270,IV,The breasts rose up and offered each a mouth.
271,IV,"And on the belly pallid blushes crept,"
272,IV,"That maddened me, until I laughed and wept."

335,TO OSCAR WILDE,O sweet to see

922,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Bird-like, my heart was glad to soar and vault;"
923,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,Fluttering among the cordages; and on
924,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"The vessel flew, under an empty vault:"
925,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,An angel drunken of a radiant sun.
926,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
927,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Tell me, what is that gray, that sombre isle?"
928,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"'Tis Cythera, famed on many a poet string;"
929,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,A name that has not lacked the slavering smile;
930,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"But now, you see, it is not much to sing."
931,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
932,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Isle of soft whispers, tremours of the heart!"
933,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,The splendid phantom of thy rude goddess
934,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Floats on thy seas like breath of spikenard,"
935,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,Charging men's souls with love and lusciousness.
936,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
937,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Sweet isle of myrtles, once of open blooms:"
938,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,Now only of lean lands most lean: it seems
939,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,A flinty desert bitter with shrill screams:
940,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,But one strange object on its horror looms.
941,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
942,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Not a fair temple, foiled with coppiced trees,"
943,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Where the young priestess, mistress of the flowers,"
944,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Goes opening her gown to the cool breeze,"
945,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"To still the fire, the torment that devours."
946,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
947,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"But as along the shore we skirted, near"
948,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Enough to scare the birds with our white sails,"
949,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,We saw a three-limbed gibbet rising sheer.
950,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,Detached against the sky in spare details.
951,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
952,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Perched on their pasturage, ferocious fowl"

976,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,

978,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,I felt the mangling of the appetites
979,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"Of the black panthers, of the savage kites,"
980,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,That were so fain to rend and pick my flesh.
981,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
982,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,The sea was sleeping. Blue and beautiful

985,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"My heart lay buried in that parable,"
986,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,
987,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,"All thine isle showed me, Venus! was upthrust,"
988,LE VOYAGE À CYTHÈRE,A symbol calvary where my image hung.
