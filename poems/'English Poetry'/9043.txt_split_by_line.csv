35,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
36,PREFACE.,
37,PREFACE.,I am of opinion that Prefaces are very useless things in cases like the
38,PREFACE.,"present, where the Author must talk of himself, with little amusement to"
39,PREFACE.,his readers. I have hesitated whether I should say any thing or nothing;
40,PREFACE.,"but as it is the fashion to say something, I suppose I must comply. I am"
41,PREFACE.,"well aware that many readers will exclaim--""It is not the common practice"
42,PREFACE.,of English baronets to remit half a year's rent to their tenants for
43,PREFACE.,"poetry, or for any thing else."" This may be very true; but I have found a"
44,PREFACE.,"character in the Rambler, No. 82, who made a very different bargain, and"
45,PREFACE.,"who says, ""And as Alfred received the tribute of the Welsh in wolves'"
46,PREFACE.,"heads, I allowed my tenants to pay their rents in butterflies, till I had"
47,PREFACE.,exhausted the papilionaceous tribe. I then directed them to the pursuit of
48,PREFACE.,"other animals, and obtained, by this easy method, most of the grubs and"
49,PREFACE.,"insects which land, air, or water can supply.........I have, from my own"
50,PREFACE.,"ground, the longest blade of grass upon record, and once accepted, as a"
51,PREFACE.,"half year's rent for a field of wheat, an ear, containing more grains than"
52,PREFACE.,"had been seen before upon a single stem."""
53,PREFACE.,
54,PREFACE.,I hope my old Sir Ambrose stands in no need of defence from me or from any
55,PREFACE.,one; a man has a right to do what he likes with his own estate. The
56,PREFACE.,characters I have introduced as candidates may not come off so easily; a
57,PREFACE.,"cluster of poets is not likely to be found in one village, and the"
58,PREFACE.,"following lines, written by my good friend T. Park. Esq. of Hampstead, are"
59,PREFACE.,"not only true, but beautifully true, and I cannot omit them."

65,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
66,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","The bard, who paints from rural plains,"
67,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",Must oft himself the void supply
68,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Of damsels pure and artless swains,"
69,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",Of innocence and industry:
70,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
71,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",For sad experience shows the heart
72,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",Of human beings much the same;
73,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Or polish'd by insidious art,"
74,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",Or rude as from the clod it came.
75,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
76,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","And he who roams the village round,"
77,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Or strays amid the harvest sere,"
78,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Will hear, as now, too many a sound"
79,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",Quiet would never wish to hear.
80,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
81,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","The wrangling rustics' loud abuse,"
82,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","The coarse, unfeeling, witless jest,"
83,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","The threat obscene, the oath profuse,"
84,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",And all that cultured minds detest.
85,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
86,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Hence let those Sylvan poets glean,"
87,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",Who picture life without a flaw;
88,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Nature may form a perfect scene,"
89,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",But Fancy must the figures draw.
90,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
91,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","The word ""fancy"" connects itself with my very childhood, fifty years back."
92,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",The fancy of those who wrote the songs which I was obliged to hear in
93,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",infancy was a very inanimate and sleepy fancy. I could enumerate a dozen
94,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","songs at least which all described sleeping shepherds and shepherdesses,"
95,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","and, in one instance, where they both went to sleep: this is not fair"
96,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","certainly; it is not even ""watch and watch."""
97,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
98,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","""As Damon and Phillis were keeping of sheep,"
99,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Being free from all care they retired to sleep,"" &c."
100,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
101,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","I must say, that if I understand any thing at all about keeping sheep,"
102,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",this is not the way to go to work with them. But such characters and such
103,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","writings were fashionable, and fashion will beat common sense at any time."
104,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
105,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","With all the beauty and spirit of Cunningham's ""Kate of Aberdeen,"" and"
106,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","some others, I never found any thing to strike my mind so forcibly as the"
107,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","last stanza of Dibdin's ""Sailor's Journal""--"
108,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
109,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","""At length, 'twas in the month of May,"
110,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Our crew, it being lovely weather,"
111,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",At three A.M. discovered day
112,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",And England's chalky cliffs together!
113,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","At seven, up channel how we bore,"
114,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",Whilst hopes and fears rush'd o'er each fancy!
115,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","At twelve, I gaily jump'd on shore,"
116,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","And to my throbbing heart press'd Nancy."""
117,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
118,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","This, to my feelings, is a balm at all times; it is spirit, animation, and"
119,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","imagery, all at once."
120,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
121,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",I will plead no excuses for any thing which the reader may find in this
122,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","little volume, but merely state, that I once met with a lady in London,"
123,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","who, though otherwise of strong mind and good information, would maintain"
124,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","that ""it is impossible for a blind man to fall in love."" I always thought"
125,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","her wrong, and the present tale of ""Alfred and Jennet"" is written to"
126,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",elucidate my side of the question.
127,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
128,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","I have been reported to be dead; but I can assure the reader that this,"
129,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","like many other reports, is not true. I have written these tales in"
130,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","anxiety, and in a wretched state of health; and if these formidable foes"
131,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","have not incapacitated me, but left me free to meet the public eye with"
132,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","any degree of credit, that degree of credit I am sure I shall gain."
133,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
134,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","I am, with remembrance of what is past,"
135,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,",
136,"WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET,","Most respectfully,"

153,THE INVITATION,
154,THE INVITATION,O for the strength to paint my joy once more!
155,THE INVITATION,That joy I feel when Winter's reign is o'er;
156,THE INVITATION,"When the dark despot lifts his hoary brow,"
157,THE INVITATION,And seeks his polar-realm's eternal snow.
158,THE INVITATION,"Though black November's fogs oppress my brain,"
159,THE INVITATION,"Shake every nerve, and struggling fancy chain;"
160,THE INVITATION,"Though time creeps o'er me with his palsied hand,"
161,THE INVITATION,"And frost-like bids the stream of passion stand,"
162,THE INVITATION,"And through his dry teeth sends a shivering blast,"
163,THE INVITATION,"And points to more than fifty winters past,"
164,THE INVITATION,"Why should I droop with heartless, aimless eye?"
165,THE INVITATION,"Friends start around, and all my phantoms fly,"
166,THE INVITATION,"And Hope, upsoaring with expanded wing,"
167,THE INVITATION,"Unfolds a scroll, inscribed ""Remember Spring."""
168,THE INVITATION,"Stay, sweet enchantress, charmer of my days,"
169,THE INVITATION,And glance thy rainbow colours o'er my lays;
170,THE INVITATION,"Be to poor Giles what thou hast ever been,"
171,THE INVITATION,His heart's warm solace and his sovereign queen;
172,THE INVITATION,"Dance with his rustics when the laugh runs high,"
173,THE INVITATION,"Live in the lover's heart, the maiden's eye;"
174,THE INVITATION,Still be propitious when his feet shall stray
175,THE INVITATION,Beneath the bursting hawthorn-buds of May;
176,THE INVITATION,"Warm every thought, and brighten every hour,"
177,THE INVITATION,And let him feel thy presence and thy power.
178,THE INVITATION,
179,THE INVITATION,"SIR AMBROSE HIGHAM, in his eightieth year,"
180,THE INVITATION,"With memory unimpair'd, and conscience clear,"
181,THE INVITATION,"His English heart untrammell'd, and full blown"
182,THE INVITATION,"His senatorial honours and renown,"
183,THE INVITATION,"Now, basking in his plenitude of fame,"
184,THE INVITATION,"Resolved, in concert with his noble dame,"
185,THE INVITATION,To drive to town no more--no more by night
186,THE INVITATION,"To meet in crowded courts a blaze of light,"
187,THE INVITATION,"In streets a roaring mob with flags unfurl'd,"
188,THE INVITATION,"And all the senseless discord of the world,--"
189,THE INVITATION,"But calmly wait the hour of his decay,"
190,THE INVITATION,The broad bright sunset of his glorious day;
191,THE INVITATION,"And where he first drew breath at last to fall,"
192,THE INVITATION,Beneath the towering shades of Oakly Hall[A].
193,THE INVITATION,
194,THE INVITATION,[Footnote A: The seat of Sir Ambrose is situated in the author's
195,THE INVITATION,imagination only; the reader must build Oakly Hall where he pleases.]
196,THE INVITATION,
197,THE INVITATION,"Quick spread the news through hamlet, field, and farm,"
198,THE INVITATION,The labourer wiped his brow and staid his arm;
199,THE INVITATION,'Twas news to him of more importance far
200,THE INVITATION,Than change of empires or the yells of war;
201,THE INVITATION,"It breathed a hope which nothing could destroy,"
202,THE INVITATION,"Poor widows rose, and clapp'd their hands for joy,"
203,THE INVITATION,"Glad voices rang at every cottage door,"
204,THE INVITATION,"""Good old Sir Ambrose goes to town no more."""
205,THE INVITATION,"Well might the village bells the triumph sound,"
206,THE INVITATION,Well might the voice of gladness ring around;
207,THE INVITATION,"Where sickness raged, or want allied to shame,"
208,THE INVITATION,Sure as the sun his well-timed succour came;
209,THE INVITATION,"Food for the starving child, and warmth and wine"
210,THE INVITATION,For age that totter'd in its last decline.
211,THE INVITATION,From him they shared the embers' social glow;
212,THE INVITATION,"_He_ fed the flame that glanced along the snow,"
213,THE INVITATION,"When winter drove his storms across the sky,"
214,THE INVITATION,And pierced the bones of shrinking poverty.
215,THE INVITATION,
216,THE INVITATION,"Sir Ambrose loved the Muses, and would pay"
217,THE INVITATION,Due honours even to the ploughman's lay;
218,THE INVITATION,"Would cheer the feebler bard, and with the strong"
219,THE INVITATION,Soar to the noblest energies of song;
220,THE INVITATION,"Catch the rib-shaking laugh, or from his eye"
221,THE INVITATION,Dash silently the tear of sympathy.
222,THE INVITATION,Happy old man!--with feelings such as these
223,THE INVITATION,"The seasons all can charm, and trifles please;"
224,THE INVITATION,"And hence a sudden thought, a new-born whim,"
225,THE INVITATION,"Would shake his cup of pleasure to the brim,"
226,THE INVITATION,"Turn scoffs and doubts and obstacles aside,"
227,THE INVITATION,And instant action follow like a tide.
228,THE INVITATION,
229,THE INVITATION,"Time past, he had on his paternal ground"
230,THE INVITATION,With pride the latent sparks of genius found
231,THE INVITATION,"In many a local ballad, many a tale,"
232,THE INVITATION,"As wild and brief as cowslips in the dale,"
233,THE INVITATION,Though unrecorded as the gleams of light
234,THE INVITATION,That vanish in the quietness of night
235,THE INVITATION,"""Why not,"" he cried, as from his couch he rose,"
236,THE INVITATION,"""To cheer my age, and sweeten my repose,"
237,THE INVITATION,"""Why not be just and generous in time,"
238,THE INVITATION,"""And bid my tenants pay their rents in rhyme?"
239,THE INVITATION,"""For one half year they shall.--A feast shall bring"
240,THE INVITATION,"""A crowd of merry faces in the spring;--"
241,THE INVITATION,"""Here, pens, boy, pens; I'll weigh the case no more,"
242,THE INVITATION,"""But write the summons:--go, go, shut the door."
243,THE INVITATION,
244,THE INVITATION,"""'All ye on Oakly manor dwelling,"
245,THE INVITATION,"'Farming, labouring, buying, selling,"
246,THE INVITATION,"'Neighbours! banish gloomy looks,"
247,THE INVITATION,'My grey old steward shuts his books.
248,THE INVITATION,'Let not a thought of winter's rent
249,THE INVITATION,'Destroy one evening's merriment;
250,THE INVITATION,"'I ask not gold, but tribute found"
251,THE INVITATION,'Abundant on Parnassian ground.
252,THE INVITATION,"'Choose, ye who boast the gift, your themes"
253,THE INVITATION,"'Of joy or pathos, tales or dreams,"
254,THE INVITATION,"'Choose each a theme;--but, harkye, bring"
255,THE INVITATION,"'No stupid ghost, no vulgar thing;"
256,THE INVITATION,"'Fairies, indeed, may wind their way,"
257,THE INVITATION,'And sparkle through the brightest lay:
258,THE INVITATION,"'I love their pranks, their favourite green,"
259,THE INVITATION,"'And, could the little sprites be seen,"
260,THE INVITATION,"'Were I a king, I'd sport with them,"
261,THE INVITATION,'And dance beneath my diadem.
262,THE INVITATION,'But surely fancy need not brood
263,THE INVITATION,"'O'er midnight darkness, crimes, and blood,"
264,THE INVITATION,"'In magic cave or monk's retreat,"
265,THE INVITATION,'Whilst the bright world is at her feet;
266,THE INVITATION,"'Whilst to her boundless range is given,"
267,THE INVITATION,"'By night, by day, the lights of heaven,"
268,THE INVITATION,'And all they shine upon; whilst Love
269,THE INVITATION,"'Still reigns the monarch of the grove,"
270,THE INVITATION,'And real life before her lies
271,THE INVITATION,"'In all its thousand, thousand dies."
272,THE INVITATION,"'Then bring me nature, bring me sense,"
273,THE INVITATION,'And joy shall be your recompense:
274,THE INVITATION,'On Old May-day I hope to see
275,THE INVITATION,'All happy:--leave the rest to me.
276,THE INVITATION,'A general feast shall cheer us all
277,THE INVITATION,"'Upon the lawn that fronts the hall,"
278,THE INVITATION,"'With tents for shelter, laurel boughs"
279,THE INVITATION,'And wreaths of every flower that blows.
280,THE INVITATION,'The months are wending fast away;
281,THE INVITATION,"'Farewell,--remember Old May-day.'"""
282,THE INVITATION,
283,THE INVITATION,"Surprise, and mirth, and gratitude, and jeers,"
284,THE INVITATION,"The clown's broad wonder, th' enthusiast's tears,"
285,THE INVITATION,"Fresh gleams of comfort on the brow of care,"
286,THE INVITATION,"The sectary's cold shrug, the miser's stare,"
287,THE INVITATION,"Were all excited, for the tidings flew"
288,THE INVITATION,As quick as scandal the whole country through.
289,THE INVITATION,"""Rent paid by rhymes at Oakly may be great,"
290,THE INVITATION,"""But rhymes for taxes would appal the state,"""
291,THE INVITATION,"Exclaim'd th' exciseman,--""and then tithes, alas!"
292,THE INVITATION,"""Why there, again, 'twill never come to pass.""--"
293,THE INVITATION,"Thus all still ventured, as the whim inclined,"
294,THE INVITATION,Remarks as various as the varying mind:
295,THE INVITATION,"For here Sir Ambrose sent a challenge forth,"
296,THE INVITATION,That claim'd a tribute due to sterling worth;
297,THE INVITATION,"And all, whatever might their host regale,"
298,THE INVITATION,Agreed to share the feast and drink his ale.
299,THE INVITATION,
300,THE INVITATION,"Now shot through many a heart a secret fire,"
301,THE INVITATION,"A new born spirit, an intense desire"
302,THE INVITATION,"For once to catch a spark of local fame,"
303,THE INVITATION,And bear a poet's honourable name!
304,THE INVITATION,"Already some aloft began to soar,"
305,THE INVITATION,And some to think who never thought before;
306,THE INVITATION,"But O, what numbers all their strength applied,"
307,THE INVITATION,Then threw despairingly the task aside
308,THE INVITATION,"With feign'd contempt, and vow'd they'd never tried."
309,THE INVITATION,"Did dairy-wife neglect to turn her cheese,"
310,THE INVITATION,Or idling miller lose the favouring breeze;
311,THE INVITATION,"Did the young ploughman o'er the furrows stand,"
312,THE INVITATION,"Or stalking sower swing an empty hand,"
313,THE INVITATION,"One common sentence on their heads would fall,"
314,THE INVITATION,'Twas Oakly banquet had bewitch'd them all.
315,THE INVITATION,"Loud roar'd the winds of March, with whirling snow,"
316,THE INVITATION,One brightening hour an April breeze would blow;
317,THE INVITATION,"Now hail, now hoar-frost bent the flow'ret's head,"
318,THE INVITATION,"Now struggling beams their languid influence shed,"
319,THE INVITATION,That scarce a cowering bird yet dared to sing
320,THE INVITATION,'Midst the wild changes of our island spring.
321,THE INVITATION,"Yet, shall the Italian goatherd boasting cry,"
322,THE INVITATION,"""Poor Albion! when hadst thou so clear a sky!"""
323,THE INVITATION,And deem that nature smiles for him alone;
324,THE INVITATION,Her renovated beauties all his own?
325,THE INVITATION,"No:--let our April showers by night descend,"
326,THE INVITATION,Noon's genial warmth with twilight stillness blend;
327,THE INVITATION,"The broad Atlantic pour her pregnant breath,"
328,THE INVITATION,And rouse the vegetable world from death;
329,THE INVITATION,"Our island spring is rapture's self to me,"
330,THE INVITATION,"All I have seen, and all I wish to see."
331,THE INVITATION,
332,THE INVITATION,"Thus came the jovial day, no streaks of red"
333,THE INVITATION,"O'er the broad portal of the morn were spread,"
334,THE INVITATION,"But one high-sailing mist of dazzling white,"
335,THE INVITATION,"A screen of gossamer, a magic light,"
336,THE INVITATION,"Doom'd instantly, by simplest shepherd's ken,"
337,THE INVITATION,"To reign awhile, and be exhaled at ten."
338,THE INVITATION,"O'er leaves, o'er blossoms, by his power restored,"
339,THE INVITATION,Forth came the conquering sun and look'd abroad;
340,THE INVITATION,"Millions of dew-drops fell, yet millions hung,"
341,THE INVITATION,Like words of transport trembling on the tongue
342,THE INVITATION,"Too strong for utt'rance:--Thus the infant boy,"
343,THE INVITATION,"With rosebud cheeks, and features tuned to joy,"
344,THE INVITATION,"Weeps while he struggles with restraint or pain,"
345,THE INVITATION,"But change the scene, and make him laugh again,"
346,THE INVITATION,"His heart rekindles, and his cheek appears"
347,THE INVITATION,A thousand times more lovely through his tears.
348,THE INVITATION,
349,THE INVITATION,From the first glimpse of day a busy scene
350,THE INVITATION,"Was that high swelling lawn, that destined green,"
351,THE INVITATION,"Which shadowless expanded far and wide,"
352,THE INVITATION,"The mansion's ornament, the hamlet's pride;"
353,THE INVITATION,"To cheer, to order, to direct, contrive,"
354,THE INVITATION,Even old Sir Ambrose had been up at five;
355,THE INVITATION,"There his whole household labour'd in his view,--"
356,THE INVITATION,But light is labour where the task is new.
357,THE INVITATION,Some wheel'd the turf to build a grassy throne
358,THE INVITATION,"Round a huge thorn that spread his boughs alone,"
359,THE INVITATION,"Rough-rined and bold, as master of the place;"
360,THE INVITATION,Five generations of the Higham race
361,THE INVITATION,"Had pluck'd his flowers, and still he held his sway,"
362,THE INVITATION,"Waved his white head, and felt the breath of May."
363,THE INVITATION,"Some from the green-house ranged exotics round,"
364,THE INVITATION,To back in open day on English ground:
365,THE INVITATION,And 'midst them in a line of splendour drew
366,THE INVITATION,"Long wreaths and garlands, gather'd in the dew."
367,THE INVITATION,"Some spread the snowy canvas, propp'd on high"
368,THE INVITATION,O'er shelter'd tables with their whole supply;
369,THE INVITATION,"Some swung the biting scythe with merry face,"
370,THE INVITATION,And cropp'd the daisies for a dancing space.
371,THE INVITATION,"Some roll'd the mouldy barrel in his might,"
372,THE INVITATION,"From prison'd darkness into cheerful light,"
373,THE INVITATION,And fenced him round with cans; and others bore
374,THE INVITATION,"The creaking hamper with its costly store,"
375,THE INVITATION,"Well cork'd, well flavour'd, and well tax'd, that came"
376,THE INVITATION,"From Lusitanian mountains, dear to fame,"
377,THE INVITATION,"Whence GAMA steer'd, and led the conquering way"
378,THE INVITATION,To eastern triumphs and the realms of day.
379,THE INVITATION,"A thousand minor tasks fill'd every hour,"
380,THE INVITATION,"'Till the sun gain'd the zenith of his power,"
381,THE INVITATION,"When every path was throng'd with old and young,"
382,THE INVITATION,And many a sky-lark in his strength upsprung
383,THE INVITATION,To bid them welcome.--Not a face was there
384,THE INVITATION,But for May-day at least had banish'd care;
385,THE INVITATION,"No cringing looks, no pauper tales to tell,"
386,THE INVITATION,"No timid glance, they knew their host too well,--"
387,THE INVITATION,"Freedom was there, and joy in every eye:"
388,THE INVITATION,Such scenes were England's boast in days gone by.
389,THE INVITATION,
390,THE INVITATION,"Beneath the thorn was good Sir Ambrose found,"
391,THE INVITATION,His guests an ample crescent form'd around;
392,THE INVITATION,"Nature's own carpet spread the space between,"
393,THE INVITATION,Where blithe domestics plied in gold and green.
394,THE INVITATION,"The venerable chaplain waved his wand,"
395,THE INVITATION,"And silence follow'd as he stretch'd his hand,"
396,THE INVITATION,"And with a trembling voice, and heart sincere,"
397,THE INVITATION,Implored a blessing on th' abundant cheer.
398,THE INVITATION,"Down sat the mingling throng, and shared a feast"
399,THE INVITATION,"With hearty welcomes given, by love increased;"
400,THE INVITATION,"A patriarch family, a close-link'd band,"
401,THE INVITATION,"True to their rural chieftain, heart and hand:"
402,THE INVITATION,"The deep carouse can never boast the bliss,"
403,THE INVITATION,The animation of a scene like this.
404,THE INVITATION,
405,THE INVITATION,"At length the damask cloths were whisk'd away,"
406,THE INVITATION,Like fluttering sails upon a summer's day;
407,THE INVITATION,The hey-day of enjoyment found repose;
408,THE INVITATION,The worthy baronet majestic rose;
409,THE INVITATION,"They view'd him, while his ale was filling round,"
410,THE INVITATION,The monarch of his own paternal ground.
411,THE INVITATION,"His cup was full, and where the blossoms bow'd"
412,THE INVITATION,"Over his head, Sir Ambrose spoke aloud,"
413,THE INVITATION,Nor stopp'd a dainty form or phrase to cull--
414,THE INVITATION,"His heart elated, like his cup, was full:--"
415,THE INVITATION,"""Full be your hopes, and rich the crops that fall;"
416,THE INVITATION,"""Health to my neighbours, happiness to all."""
417,THE INVITATION,"Dull must that clown be, dull as winter's sleet,"
418,THE INVITATION,Who would not instantly be on his feet:
419,THE INVITATION,"An echoing health to mingling shouts gave place,"
420,THE INVITATION,"""Sir Ambrose Higham, and his noble race."""
421,THE INVITATION,
422,THE INVITATION,"Avaunt, Formality! thou bloodless dame,"
423,THE INVITATION,With dripping besom quenching nature's flame;
424,THE INVITATION,"Thou cankerworm, who liv'st but to destroy,"
425,THE INVITATION,And eat the very heart of social joy;--
426,THE INVITATION,"Thou freezing mist round intellectual mirth,"
427,THE INVITATION,"Thou spell-bound vagabond of spurious birth,"
428,THE INVITATION,"Away! away! and let the sun shine clear,"
429,THE INVITATION,And all the kindnesses of life appear.
430,THE INVITATION,
431,THE INVITATION,"With mild complacency, and smiling brow,"
432,THE INVITATION,"The host look'd round, and bade the goblets flow;"
433,THE INVITATION,Yet curiously anxious to behold
434,THE INVITATION,Who first would pay in rhymes instead of gold;
435,THE INVITATION,Each eye inquiring through the ring was glanced
436,THE INVITATION,"To see who dared the task, who first advanced;"
437,THE INVITATION,"That instant started Philip from the throng,"
438,THE INVITATION,"Philip, a farmer's son, well known for song,--"
439,THE INVITATION,"And, as the mingling whispers round him ran,"
440,THE INVITATION,"He humbly bow'd, and timidly began:--"
441,THE INVITATION,
442,THE INVITATION,
443,THE INVITATION,
444,THE INVITATION,
445,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,THE DRUNKEN FATHER
446,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
447,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Poor Ellen married Andrew Hall,"
448,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Who dwells beside the moor,"
449,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Where yonder rose-tree shades the wall,"
450,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And woodbines grace the door.
451,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
452,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Who does not know how blest, how loved"
453,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Were her mild laughing eyes
454,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,By every youth!--but Andrew proved
455,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Unworthy of his prize.
456,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
457,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"In tippling was his whole delight,"
458,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Each sign-post barr'd his way;
459,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,He spent in muddy ale at night
460,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The wages of the day.
461,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
462,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Though Ellen still had charms, was young,"
463,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And he in manhood's prime,"
464,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"She sad beside her cradle sung,"
465,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And sigh'd away her time.
466,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
467,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"One cold bleak night, the stars were hid,"
468,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,In vain she wish'd him home;
469,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Her children cried, half cheer'd, half chid,"
470,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""O when will father come!"""
471,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
472,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"'Till Caleb, nine years old, upsprung,"
473,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And kick'd his stool aside,"
474,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And younger Mary round him clung,"
475,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""I'll go, and you shall guide."""
476,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
477,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The children knew each inch of ground,"
478,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Yet Ellen had her fears;
479,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Light from the lantern glimmer'd round,"
480,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And show'd her falling tears.
481,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
482,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Go by the mill and down the lane;"
483,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Return the same way home:"
484,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Perhaps you'll meet him, give him light;"
485,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""O how I _wish_ he'd come."""
486,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
487,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Away they went, as close and true"
488,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"As lovers in the shade,"
489,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And Caleb swung his father's staff
490,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,At every step he made.
491,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
492,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The noisy mill-clack rattled on,"
493,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"They saw the water flow,"
494,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And leap in silvery foam along,"
495,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Deep murmuring below.
496,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
497,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""We'll soon be there,"" the hero said,"
498,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Come on, 'tis but a mile,--"
499,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Here's where the cricket-match was play'd,"
500,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""And here's the shady stile."
501,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
502,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""How the light shines up every bough!"
503,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""How strange the leaves appear!"
504,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Hark!--What was that?--'tis silent now,"
505,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Come, Mary, never fear."""
506,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
507,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The staring oxen breathed aloud,"
508,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,But never dream'd of harm;
509,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,A meteor glanced along the cloud
510,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,That hung o'er Wood-Hill Farm.
511,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
512,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Old Caesar bark'd and howl'd hard by,"
513,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"All else was still as death,"
514,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"But Caleb was ashamed to cry,"
515,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And Mary held her breath.
516,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
517,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"At length they spied a distant light,"
518,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And heard a chorus brawl;
519,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Wherever drunkards stopp'd at night,"
520,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Why there was Andrew Hall.
521,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
522,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The house was full, the landlord gay,"
523,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The bar-maid shook her head,"
524,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And wish'd the boobies far away
525,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,That kept her out of bed.
526,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
527,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"There Caleb enter'd, firm, but mild,"
528,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And spoke in plaintive tone:--
529,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""My mother could not leave the child,"
530,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""So we are come alone."""
531,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
532,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,E'en drunken Andrew felt the blow
533,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"That innocence can give,"
534,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,When its resistless accents flow
535,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,To bid affection live.
536,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
537,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""I'm coming, loves, I'm coming now,""--"
538,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Then, shuffling o'er the floor,"
539,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Contrived to make his balance true,"
540,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And led them from the door.
541,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
542,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The plain broad path that brought him there
543,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"By day, though faultless then,"
544,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Was up and down and narrow grown,"
545,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Though wide enough for ten.
546,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
547,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The stiles were wretchedly contrived,"
548,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The stars were all at play,"
549,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And many a ditch had moved itself
550,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Exactly in his way.
551,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
552,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"But still conceit was uppermost,"
553,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,That stupid kind of pride:--
554,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Dost think I cannot see a post?"
555,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Dost think I want a guide?"
556,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
557,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Why, Mary, how you twist and twirl!"
558,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Why dost not keep the track?"
559,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""I'll carry thee home safe, my girl,""--"
560,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Then swung her on his back.
561,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
562,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Poor Caleb muster'd all his wits
563,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"To bear the light ahead,"
564,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"As Andrew reel'd and stopp'd by fits,"
565,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Or ran with thund'ring tread.
566,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
567,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Exult, ye brutes, traduced and scorn'd,"
568,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Though true to nature's plan;
569,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Exult, ye bristled, and ye horn'd,"
570,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,When infants govern man.
571,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
572,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Down to the mill-pool's dangerous brink
573,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The headlong party drove;
574,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The boy alone had power to think,"
575,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,While Mary scream'd above.
576,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
577,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Stop!"" Caleb cried, ""you've lost the path;"
578,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""The water's close before;"
579,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""I see it shine, 'tis very deep,--"
580,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Why, don't you hear it roar?"""
581,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
582,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And then in agony exclaim'd,"
583,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""O where's my mother _now_?"""
584,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The Solomon of hops and malt
585,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Stopp'd short and made a bow:
586,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
587,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"His head was loose, his neck disjointed,"
588,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,It cost him little trouble;
589,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"But, to be stopp'd and disappointed,"
590,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Poh! danger was a bubble.
591,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
592,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Onward be stepp'd, the boy alert,"
593,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Calling his courage forth,"
594,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Hung like a log on Andrew's skirt,"
595,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And down he brought them both.
596,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
597,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The tumbling lantern reach'd the stream,"
598,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Its hissing light soon gone;
599,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"'Twas night, without a single gleam,"
600,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And terror reign'd alone.
601,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
602,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"A general scream the miller heard,"
603,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Then rubb'd his eyes and ran,"
604,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And soon his welcome light appear'd,"
605,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,As grumbling he began:--
606,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
607,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""What have we here, and whereabouts?"
608,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Why what a hideous squall!"
609,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Some drunken fool! I thought as much--"
610,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""'Tis only Andrew Hall!"
611,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
612,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Poor children!"" tenderly he said,"
613,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""But now the danger's past."""
614,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"They thank'd him for his light and aid,"
615,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And drew near home at last.
616,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
617,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,But who upon the misty path
618,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,To meet them forward press'd?
619,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"'Twas Ellen, shivering, with a babe"
620,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Close folded to her breast.
621,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
622,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Said Andrew, ""Now you're glad, I know,"
623,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""To se-se-see us come;--"
624,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""But I have taken care of both,"
625,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""And brought them bo-bo-both safe home."""
626,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
627,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"With Andrew vex'd, of Mary proud,"
628,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"But prouder of her boy,"
629,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"She kiss'd them both, and sobb'd aloud,--"
630,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The children cried for joy.
631,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
632,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,But what a home at last they found!
633,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Of comforts all bereft;
634,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The fire out, the last candle gone,"
635,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And not one penny left!
636,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
637,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"But Caleb quick as light'ning flew,"
638,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And raised a light instead;
639,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And as the kindling brands he blew,"
640,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,His father snored in bed.
641,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
642,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"No brawling, boxing termagant"
643,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Was Ellen, though offended;"
644,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Who ever knew a fault like this
645,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,By violence amended?
646,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
647,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"No:--she was mild as April morn,"
648,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And Andrew loved her too;
649,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"She rose at daybreak, though forlorn,"
650,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,To try what love could do.
651,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
652,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And as her waking husband groan'd,"
653,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And roll'd his burning head,"
654,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"She spoke with all the power of truth,"
655,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,Down kneeling by his bed.
656,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
657,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Dear Andrew, hear me,--though distress'd"
658,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Almost too much to speak,--"
659,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""This infant starves upon my breast--"
660,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""To scold I am too weak."
661,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
662,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""I work, I spin, I toil all day,"
663,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Then leave my work to cry,"
664,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""And start with horror when I think"
665,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""You wish to see me die."
666,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
667,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""But _do_ you wish it? can that bring"
668,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""More comfort, or more joy?"
669,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Look round the house, how destitute!"
670,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Look at your ragged boy!"
671,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
672,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""That boy should make a father proud,"
673,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""If any feeling can;"
674,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Then save your children, save your wife,"
675,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Your honour as a man."
676,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
677,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Hear me, for God's sake hear me now,"
678,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""And act a father's part!"""
679,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The culprit bless'd her angel tongue,"
680,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And clasp'd her to his heart;
681,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
682,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And would have vow'd, and would have sworn,"
683,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"But Ellen kiss'd him dumb,--"
684,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Exert your mind, vow to _yourself_,"
685,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""And better days will come."
686,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
687,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""I shall be well when you are kind,"
688,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""And you'll be better too.""--"
689,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""I'll drink no more,""--he quick rejoin'd,--"
690,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Be't poison if I do."""
691,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
692,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"From that bright day his plants, his flowers,"
693,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"His crops began to thrive,"
694,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And for three years has Andrew been
695,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The soberest man alive.
696,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
697,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Soon as he ended, acclamations 'rose,"
698,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Endang'ring modesty and self-repose,"
699,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Till the good host his prudent counsel gave,"
700,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Then listen'd all, the flippant and the grave."
701,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Let not applauses vanity inspire,"
702,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Deter humility, or damp desire;"
703,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Neighbours we are, then let the stream run fair,"
704,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""And every couplet be as free as air;"
705,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Be silent when each speaker claims his right,"
706,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Enjoy the day as I enjoy the sight:"
707,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""They shall not class us with the knavish elves,"
708,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"""Who banish shame, and criticise themselves."""
709,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
710,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Thenceforward converse flow'd with perfect ease,"
711,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Midst country wit, and rustic repartees."
712,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"One drank to Ellen, if such might be found,"
713,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And archly glanced at female faces round.
714,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"If one with tilted can began to bawl,"
715,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Another cried, ""Remember Andrew Hall."""
716,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
717,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Then, multifarious topics, corn and hay,"
718,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Vestry intrigues, the rates they had to pay,"
719,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"The thriving stock, the lands too wet, too dry,"
720,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"And all that bears on fruitful husbandry,"
721,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Ran mingling through the crowd--a crowd that might,"
722,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Transferr'd to canvas, give the world delight;"
723,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,A scene that WILKIE might have touch'd with pride--
724,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The May-day banquet then had never died.
725,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,
726,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"But who is he, uprisen, with eye so keen,"
727,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,In garb of shining plush of grassy green--
728,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Dogs climbing round him, eager for the start,"
729,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"With ceaseless tail, and doubly beating heart?"
730,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"A stranger, who from distant forests came,"
731,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,The sturdy keeper of the Oakly game.
732,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"Short prelude made, he pointed o'er the hill,"
733,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,And raised a voice that every ear might fill;
734,THE DRUNKEN FATHER,"His heart was in his theme, and in the forest still."

1206,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"In her the charms of all the rest ran wild,"
1207,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And sprouted as they pleased. Still by my side,"
1208,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I own she was my favourite, was my pride,"
1209,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Since first she labour'd round my neck to twine,"
1210,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Or clasp'd both little hands in one of mine:
1211,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And when the season broke, I've seen her bring"
1212,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Lapfuls of flowers, and then the girl would sing"
1213,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Whole songs, and halves, and bits, O, with such glee!"
1214,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"If playmates found a favourite, it was she."
1215,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Her lively spirit lifted her to joy;
1216,ALFRED AND JENNET.,To distance in the race a clumsy boy
1217,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Would raise the flush of conquest in her eye,"
1218,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And all was dance, and laugh, and liberty."
1219,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Yet not hard-hearted, take me right, I beg,"
1220,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The veriest romp that ever wagg'd a leg
1221,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Was Jennet; but when pity soothed her mind,"
1222,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Prompt with her tears, and delicately kind."
1223,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The half-fledged nestling, rabbit, mouse, or dove,"
1224,ALFRED AND JENNET.,By turns engaged her cares and infant love;
1225,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And many a one, at the last doubtful strife,"
1226,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Warm'd in her bosom, started into life."
1227,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1228,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"At thirteen she was all that Heaven could send,"

1230,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Last at my pillow when I sunk to sleep,"

1232,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I heard her happy to her heart's desire,"
1233,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"With clanking pattens, and a roaring fire."
1234,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1235,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Then, having store of new-laid eggs to spare,"
1236,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She fill'd her basket with the simple fare,"
1237,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And weekly trudged (I think I see her still)
1238,ALFRED AND JENNET.,To sell them at yon house upon the hill.
1239,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Oft have I watch'd her as she stroll'd along,"
1240,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Heard the gate bang, and heard her morning song;"
1241,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And, as my warm ungovern'd feelings rose,"
1242,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Said to myself, ""Heaven bless her! there she goes."""
1243,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Long would she tarry, and then dancing home,"
1244,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Tell how the lady bade her oft'ner come,"
1245,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And bade her talk and laugh without control;
1246,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For Jennet's voice was music to the soul,"
1247,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"My tale shall prove it:--For there dwelt a son,"
1248,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"An only child, and where there is but one,"
1249,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Indulgence like a mildew reigns, from whence"
1250,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Mischief may follow if that child wants sense.
1251,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But Alfred was a youth of noble mind,"
1252,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"With ardent passions, and with taste refined;"
1253,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"All that could please still courted heart and hand,"
1254,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Music, joy, peace, and wealth, at his command;"
1255,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Wealth, which his widow'd mother deem'd his own;"
1256,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Except the poor, she lived for him alone."
1257,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Yet would she weep by stealth when he was near,"
1258,ALFRED AND JENNET.,But check'd all sighs to spare his wounded ear;
1259,ALFRED AND JENNET.,For from his cradle he had never seen
1260,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Soul-cheering sunbeams, or wild nature's green."
1261,ALFRED AND JENNET.,But all life's blessings centre not in sight;
1262,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For Providence, that dealt him one long night,"
1263,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Had given, in pity to the blooming boy,"
1264,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Feelings more exquisitely tuned to joy.
1265,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Fond to excess was he of all that grew;
1266,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The morning blossom sprinkled o'er with dew,"
1267,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Across his path, as if in playful freak,"
1268,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Would dash his brow, and weep upon his cheek;"
1269,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Each varying leaf that brush'd where'er he came,"
1270,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Press'd to his rosy lip he call'd by name;
1271,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"He grasp'd the saplings, measured every bough,"
1272,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Inhaled the fragrance that the spring months throw
1273,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Profusely round, till his young heart confess'd"
1274,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"That all was beauty, and himself was bless'd."
1275,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Yet when he traced the wide extended plain,"
1276,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Or clear brook side, he felt a transient pain;"
1277,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The keen regret of goodness, void of pride,"
1278,ALFRED AND JENNET.,To think he could not roam without a guide.
1279,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1280,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Who, guess ye, knew these scenes of home delight"
1281,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Better than Jennet, bless'd with health and sight?"
1282,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Whene'er she came, he from his sports would slide,"
1283,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And catch her wild laugh, listening by her side;"
1284,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Mount to the tell-tale clock with ardent spring,"
1285,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And _feel_ the passing hour, then fondly cling"
1286,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"To Jennet's arm, and tell how sweet the breath"
1287,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Of bright May-mornings on the open heath;
1288,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Then off they started, rambling far and wide,"
1289,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Like Cupid with a wood-nymph by his side.
1290,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1291,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Thus months and months roll'd on, the summer pass'd,"
1292,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And the long darkness, and the winter blast,"
1293,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Sever'd the pair; no flowery fields to roam,"
1294,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Poor Alfred sought his music and his home.
1295,ALFRED AND JENNET.,What wonder then if inwardly he pined?
1296,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The anxious mother mark'd her stripling's mind
1297,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Gloomy and sad, yet striving to be gay"
1298,ALFRED AND JENNET.,As the long tedious evenings pass'd away:
1299,ALFRED AND JENNET.,'Twas her delight fresh spirits to supply.--
1300,ALFRED AND JENNET.,My girl was sent for--just for company.
1301,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1302,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"A tender governess my daughter found,"
1303,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Her temper placid, her instruction sound;"
1304,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Plain were her precepts, full of strength, their power"
1305,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Was founded on the practice of the hour:
1306,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Theirs were the happy nights to peace resign'd,"
1307,ALFRED AND JENNET.,With ample means to cheer th' unbended mind.
1308,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The Sacred History, or the volumes fraught"
1309,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"With tenderest sympathy, or towering thought,"
1310,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The laughter-stirring tale, the moral lay,"
1311,ALFRED AND JENNET.,All that brings dawning reason into day.
1312,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"There Jennet learn'd by maps, through every land"
1313,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"To travel, and to name them at command;"
1314,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Would tell how great their strength, their bounds how far,"
1315,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And show where uncle Charles was in the war.
1316,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The globe she managed with a timid hand,"
1317,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Told which was ocean, which was solid land,"
1318,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And said, whate'er their diff'rent climates bore,"
1319,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"All still roll'd round, though that I knew before."
1320,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1321,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Thus grown familiar, and at perfect ease,"
1322,ALFRED AND JENNET.,What could be Jennet's duty but to please?
1323,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Yet hitherto she kept, scarce knowing why,"
1324,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"One powerful charm reserved, and still was shy."
1325,ALFRED AND JENNET.,When Alfred from his grand-piano drew
1326,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Those heavenly sounds that seem'd for ever new,"
1327,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She sat as if to sing would be a crime,"
1328,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And only gazed with joy, and nodded time."
1329,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Till one snug evening, I myself was there,"
1330,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The whispering lad inquired, behind my chair,"
1331,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Bowman, can Jennet sing?"" ""At home,"" said I,"
1332,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""She sings from morn till night, and seems to fly"
1333,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""From tune to tune, the sad, the wild, the merry,"
1334,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""And moulds her lip to suit them like a cherry;"
1335,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""She learn'd them here.""--""O ho!"" said he, ""O ho!"""
1336,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And rubb'd his hands, and stroked his forehead, so."
1337,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Then down he sat, sought out a tender strain,"
1338,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Sung the first words, then struck the chords again;"
1339,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Come, Jennet, help me, you _must_ know this song"
1340,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Which I have sung, and you have heard so long."""
1341,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I mark'd the palpitation of her heart,"
1342,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Yet she complied, and strove to take a part,"
1343,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But faint and fluttering, swelling by degrees,"
1344,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Ere self-composure gave that perfect ease,"
1345,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The soul of song:--then, with triumphant glee,"
1346,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Resting her idle work upon her knee,"
1347,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Her little tongue soon fill'd the room around
1348,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"With such a voluble and magic sound,"
1349,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"That, 'spite of all her pains to persevere,"
1350,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She stopp'd to sigh, and wipe a starting tear;"
1351,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Then roused herself for faults to make amends.
1352,ALFRED AND JENNET.,While Alfred trembled to his fingers' ends.
1353,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1354,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But when this storm of feeling sunk to rest,"
1355,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Jennet, resuming, sung her very best,"
1356,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And on the ear, with many a dying fall,"
1357,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She pour'd th' enchanting ""Harp of Tara's Hall."""
1358,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Still Alfred hid his raptures from her view,"
1359,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Still touch'd the keys, those raptures to renew,"
1360,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And led her on to that sweet past'ral air,"
1361,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The Highland Laddie with the yellow hair.
1362,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She caught the sound, and with the utmost ease"
1363,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Bade nature's music triumph, sure to please:"
1364,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Such truth, such warmth, such tenderness express'd,"
1365,ALFRED AND JENNET.,That my old heart was dancing in my breast.
1366,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Upsprung the youth, ""O Jennet, where's your hand?"
1367,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""There's not another girl in all the land,"
1368,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""If she could bring me empires, bring me sight,"
1369,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Could give me such unspeakable delight:"
1370,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""You little baggage! not to tell before"
1371,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""That you could sing; mind--you go home no more."""
1372,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1373,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Thus I have seen her from my own fire-side
1374,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Attain the utmost summit of her pride;
1375,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For, from that singing hour, as time roll'd round,"
1376,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"At the great house my Jennet might be found,"
1377,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And, while I watch'd her progress with delight,"
1378,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She had a father's blessing every night,"
1379,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And grew in knowledge at that moral school
1380,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Till I began to guess myself a fool.
1381,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Music! why she could play as well as he!
1382,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"At least I thought so,--but we'll let that be:"
1383,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She read the poets, grave and light, by turns,"
1384,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And talk'd of Cowper's ""Task,"" and Robin Burns;"
1385,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Nay, read without a book, as I may say,"
1386,ALFRED AND JENNET.,As much as some could with in half a day.
1387,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"'Twas thus I found they pass'd their happy time,"
1388,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"In all their walks, when nature in her prime"
1389,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Spread forth her scents and hues, and whisper'd love"
1390,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And joy to every bird in every grove;
1391,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And though their colours could not meet his eye,"
1392,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She pluck'd him flowers, then talk'd of poetry."
1393,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1394,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Once on a sunbright morning, 'twas in June,"
1395,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I felt my spirits and my hopes in tune,"
1396,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And idly rambled forth, as if t' explore"
1397,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The little valley just before my door;
1398,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Down by yon dark green oak I found a seat
1399,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Beneath the clustering thorns, a snug retreat"
1400,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For poets, as I deem'd, who often prize"
1401,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Such holes and corners far from human eyes;
1402,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I mark'd young Alfred, led by Jennet, stray"
1403,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Just to the spot, both chatting on their way:"
1404,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"They came behind me, I was still unseen;"
1405,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"He was the elder, Jennet was sixteen."
1406,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"My heart misgave me, lest I should be deem'd"
1407,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"A prying listener, never much esteem'd,"
1408,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But this fear soon subsided, and I said,"
1409,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I'll hear this blind lad and my little maid."""
1410,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"That instant down she pluck'd a woodbine wreath,"
1411,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The loose leaves rattled on my head beneath;
1412,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"This was for Alfred, which he seized with joy,"
1413,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""O, thank you, Jennet,"" said the generous boy."
1414,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Much was their talk, which many a theme supplied,"
1415,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"As down they sat, for every blade was dried."
1416,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1417,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I would have skulk'd away, but dare not move,"
1418,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Besides,"" thought I, ""they will not talk of love;"""
1419,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But I was wrong, for Alfred, with a sigh,"
1420,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"A little tremulous, a little shy,"
1421,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But, with the tenderest accents, ask'd his guide"
1422,ALFRED AND JENNET.,A question which might touch both love and pride.
1423,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""This morning, Jennet, why did you delay,"
1424,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""And talk to that strange clown upon your way,"
1425,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Our homespun gardener? how can you bear"
1426,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""His screech-owl tones upon your perfect ear?"
1427,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I cannot like that man, yet know not why,"
1428,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""He's surely quite as old again as I;"
1429,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""He's ignorant, and cannot be your choice,"
1430,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""And ugly too, I'm certain, by his voice,"
1431,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Besides, he call'd you pretty.""--""Well, what then?"
1432,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I cannot hide my face from all the men;"
1433,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Alfred, indeed, indeed, you are deceived,"
1434,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""He never spoke a word that I believed;"
1435,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Nay, can he think that I would leave a home"
1436,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Full of enjoyment, present, and to come,"
1437,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""While your dear mother's favours daily prove"
1438,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""How sweet the bonds of gratitude and love?"
1439,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""No, while beneath her roof I shall remain,"
1440,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I'll never vex you, never give you pain."""
1441,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Enough, my life,"" he cried, and up they sprung;"
1442,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"By Heaven, I almost wish'd that I was young;"
1443,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"It was a dainty sight to see them pass,"
1444,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Light as the July fawns upon the grass,"
1445,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Pure as the breath of spring when forth it spreads,"
1446,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Love in their hearts, and sunshine on their heads."
1447,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1448,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Next day I felt what I was bound to do,"
1449,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"To weigh the adventure well, and tell it too;"
1450,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For Alfred's mother must not be beguiled,"
1451,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"He was her earthly hope, her only child;"
1452,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I had no wish, no right to pass it by,"
1453,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"It might bring grief, perhaps calamity."
1454,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She was the judge, and she alone should know"
1455,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Whether to check the flame or let it grow.
1456,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I went with fluttering heart, and moisten'd eye,"
1457,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But strong in truth, and arm'd for her reply."
1458,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1459,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Well, master Bowman, why that serious face?"""
1460,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Exclaim'd the lovely dame, with such a grace,"
1461,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"That had I knelt before her, I had been"
1462,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Not quite the simplest votary ever seen.
1463,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I told my tale, and urged that well-known truth,"
1464,ALFRED AND JENNET.,That the soft passion in the bloom of youth
1465,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Starts into power, and leads th' unconscious heart"
1466,ALFRED AND JENNET.,A chase where reason takes but little part;
1467,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Nothing was more in nature, or more pure,"
1468,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And from their habits nothing was more sure.
1469,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Whether the lady blush'd from pride or joy,"
1470,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I could but guess;--at length she said--""My boy"
1471,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Dropp'd not a syllable of this to me!
1472,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"What was I doing, that I could not see?"
1473,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Through all the anxious hours that I have known,"
1474,ALFRED AND JENNET.,His welfare still was dearer than my own;
1475,ALFRED AND JENNET.,How have I mourn'd o'er his unhappy fate!
1476,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Blind as he is! the heir to my estate!
1477,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I now might break his heart, and Jennet's too;"
1478,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"What must I, Bowman, or what can I do?""--"
1479,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Do, madam?"" said I, boldly, ""if you trace"
1480,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Impending degradation or disgrace"
1481,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""In this attachment, let us not delay;"
1482,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Send my girl home, and check it while you may."""
1483,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I will,"" she said, but the next moment sigh'd;"
1484,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Parental love was struggling hard with pride.
1485,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1486,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I left her thus, deep musing, and soon found"
1487,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"My daughter, for I traced her by the sound"
1488,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Of Alfred's flageolet; no cares had they,"
1489,ALFRED AND JENNET.,But in the garden bower spent half the day.
1490,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"By starts he sung, then wildest trillings made,"
1491,ALFRED AND JENNET.,To mock a piping blackbird in the glade.
1492,ALFRED AND JENNET.,I turn'd a corner and approach'd the pair;
1493,ALFRED AND JENNET.,My little rogue had roses in her hair!
1494,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She whipp'd them out, and with a downcast look,"
1495,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Conquer'd a laugh by poring on her book.
1496,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"My object was to talk with her aside,"
1497,ALFRED AND JENNET.,But at the sight my resolution died;
1498,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"They look'd so happy in their blameless glee,"
1499,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"That, as I found them, I e'en let them be;"
1500,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Though Jennet promised a few social hours
1501,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"'Midst her old friends, my poultry, and my flowers."
1502,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She came,--but not till fatal news had wrung"
1503,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Her heart through sleepless hours, and chain'd her tongue."
1504,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She came, but with a look that gave me pain,"
1505,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For, though bright sunbeams sparkled after rain,"
1506,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Though every brood came round, half run, half fly,"
1507,ALFRED AND JENNET.,I knew her anguish by her alter'd eye;
1508,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And strove, with all my power, where'er she came,"
1509,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"To soothe her grief, yet gave it not a name."
1510,ALFRED AND JENNET.,At length a few sad bitter tears she shed.
1511,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And on both hands reclined her aching head.
1512,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"'Twas then my time the conqueror to prove,"
1513,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I summon'd all my rhetoric, all my love."
1514,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Jennet, you must not think to pass through life"
1515,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Without its sorrows, and without its strife;"
1516,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Good, dutiful, and worthy, as you are,"
1517,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""You must have griefs, and you must learn to bear."""
1518,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Thus I went on, trite moral truths to string,--"
1519,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"All chaff, mere chaff, where love has spread his wing:"
1520,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She cared not, listen'd not, nor seem'd to know"
1521,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"What was my aim, but wiped her burning brow,"
1522,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Where sat more eloquence and living power
1523,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Than language could embody in an hour.
1524,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"With soften'd tone I mention'd Alfred's name,"
1525,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"His wealth, our poverty, and that sad blame"
1526,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Which would have weigh'd me down, had I not told"
1527,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The secret which I dare not keep for gold,"
1528,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Of Alfred's love, o'erheard the other morn."
1529,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The gardener, and the woodbine, and the thorn;"
1530,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And added, ""Though the lady sends you home,"
1531,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""You are but young, child, and a day may come""--"
1532,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""She has _not_ sent me home,"" the girl replied,"
1533,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And rose with sobs of passion from my side;
1534,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""She has _not_ sent me home, dear father, no;"
1535,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""She gives me leave to tarry or to go;"
1536,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""She has not _blamed_ me,--yet she weeps no less,"
1537,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""And every tear but adds to my distress;"
1538,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I am the cause,--thus all that she has done"
1539,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Will bring the death or misery of her son."
1540,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Jealous he might be, could he but have seen"
1541,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""How other lads approach'd where I have been;"
1542,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""But this man's voice offends his very soul,"
1543,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""That strange antipathy brooks no control;"
1544,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""And should I leave him now, or seem unkind,"
1545,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""The thought would surely wreck his noble mind;"
1546,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""To leave him thus, and in his utmost need!"
1547,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Poor Alfred! then you will be blind indeed!"
1548,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I will not leave him.""--""Nay, child, do not rave,"
1549,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""What, would you be his menial, be his slave?"""
1550,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Yes,"" she exclaim'd, and wiped each streaming eye,"
1551,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Yes, be his slave, and serve him till I die;"
1552,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""He is too just to act the tyrant's part,"
1553,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""He's truth itself."" O how my burthen'd heart"
1554,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Sigh'd for relief!--soon that relief was found;
1555,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Without one word we traced the meadow round,"
1556,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Her feverish hand in mine, and weigh'd the case,"
1557,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Nor dared to look each other in the face;
1558,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Till, with a sudden stop, as if from fear,"
1559,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"I roused her sinking spirit, ""Who comes here?"""
1560,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1561,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Down the green slope before us, glowing warm,"
1562,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Came Alfred, tugging at his mother's arm;"
1563,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Willing she seem'd, but he still led the way,"
1564,ALFRED AND JENNET.,She had not walk'd so fast for many a day;
1565,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"His hand was lifted, and his brow was bare,"
1566,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For now no clust'ring ringlets wanton'd there,"
1567,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"He threw them back in anger and in spleen,"
1568,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And shouted ""Jennet"" o'er the daisied green."
1569,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Boyish impatience strove with manly grace
1570,ALFRED AND JENNET.,In ev'ry line and feature of his face;
1571,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"His claim appear'd resistless as his choice,"
1572,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And when he caught the sound of Jennet's voice,"
1573,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And when with spotless soul he clasp'd the maid,"
1574,ALFRED AND JENNET.,My heart exulted while my breath was staid.
1575,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Jennet, we must not part! return again;"
1576,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""What have I done to merit all this pain?"
1577,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Dear mother, share my fortune with the poor,"
1578,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Jennet is mine, and _shall_ be--say no more;"
1579,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Bowman, you know not what a friend I'll be;"
1580,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Give me your daughter, Bowman, give her me;"
1581,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Jennet, what will my days be if you go?"
1582,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""A dreary darkness, and a life of woe:"
1583,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""My dearest love, come _home_, and do not cry;"
1584,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""You are my daylight, Jennet, I shall die."""
1585,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1586,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"To such appeals all prompt replies are cold,"
1587,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And stately prudence snaps her cobweb hold.
1588,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Had the good widow tried, or wish'd to speak,"
1589,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"This was a bond she could not, dared not break;"
1590,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Their hearts (you never saw their likeness, never)"
1591,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Were join'd, indissolubly join'd for ever."
1592,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Why need I tell how soon our tears were dried.
1593,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"How Jennet blush'd, how Alfred with a stride"
1594,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Bore off his prize, and fancied every charm,"
1595,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And clipp'd against his ribs her trembling arm;
1596,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"How mute we seniors stood, our power all gone?"
1597,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Completely conquer'd, Love the day had won,"
1598,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And the young vagrant triumph'd in our plight,"
1599,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And shook his roguish plumes, and laugh'd outright."
1600,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Yet, by my life and hopes, I would not part"
1601,ALFRED AND JENNET.,With this sweet recollection from my heart;
1602,ALFRED AND JENNET.,I would not now forget that tender scene
1603,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"To wear a crown, or make my girl a queen."
1604,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Why need be told how pass'd the months along,"
1605,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"How sped the summer's walk, the winter's song,"
1606,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"How the foil'd suitor all his hopes gave up,"
1607,ALFRED AND JENNET.,How Providence with rapture fill'd their cup?
1608,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"No dark regrets, no tragic scenes to prove,"
1609,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The gardener was too old to die for love.
1610,ALFRED AND JENNET.,A thousand incidents I cast aside
1611,ALFRED AND JENNET.,To tell but one--I gave away the bride--
1612,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Gave the dear youth what kings could not have given;
1613,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Then bless'd them both, and put my trust in Heaven."
1614,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"There the old neighbours laugh'd the night away,"
1615,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Who talk of Jennet's wedding to this day.
1616,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And could you but have seen the modest grace,"
1617,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The half-hid smiles that play'd in Jennet's face,"
1618,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Or mark'd the bridegroom's bounding heart o'erflow,"
1619,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"You might have wept for joy, as I could now:"
1620,ALFRED AND JENNET.,I speak from memory of days long past;
1621,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Though 'tis a father's tale, I've done at last."
1622,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1623,ALFRED AND JENNET.,*       *       *       *       *
1624,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1625,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Here rest thee, rest thee, Muse, review the scene"
1626,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Where thou with me from peep of dawn hast been:
1627,ALFRED AND JENNET.,We did not promise that this motley throng
1628,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Should every _one_ supply a votive song;
1629,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Nor every tenant:--yet thou hast been kind,"
1630,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"For untold tales must still remain behind,"
1631,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Which might o'er listening patience still prevail.
1632,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Did fancy waver not, nor daylight fail."
1633,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""The Soldier's Wife,"" her toils, his battles o'er,"
1634,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Love in a Shower,"" the riv'let's sudden roar;"
1635,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Then, ""Lines to Aggravation"" form the close,"
1636,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Parent of murders, and the worst of woes."
1637,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But while the changeful hours of daylight flew,"
1638,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Some homeward look'd, and talk'd of evening dew;"
1639,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Some watch'd the sun's decline, and stroll'd around,"
1640,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Some wish'd another dance, and partners found;"
1641,ALFRED AND JENNET.,When in an instant every eye was drawn
1642,ALFRED AND JENNET.,To one bright object on the upper lawn;
1643,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"A fair procession from the mansion came,"
1644,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Unknown its purport, and unknown its aim."
1645,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"No gazer could refrain, no tongue could cease,"
1646,ALFRED AND JENNET.,It seem'd an embassy of love and peace.
1647,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Nearer and nearer still approach'd the train,"
1648,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Age in the van transform'd to youth again.
1649,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Sir Ambrose gazed, and scarce believed his eyes;"
1650,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"'Twas magic, memory, love, and blank surprise,"
1651,ALFRED AND JENNET.,For there his venerable lady wore
1652,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The very dress which, sixty years before,"
1653,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Had sparkled on her sunshine bridal morn,"
1654,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Had sparkled, ay, beneath this very thorn!"
1655,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Her hair was snowy white, o'er which was seen,"
1656,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Emblem of what her bridal cheeks had been,"
1657,ALFRED AND JENNET.,A twin red rose--no other ornament
1658,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Had pride suggested, or false feeling lent;"
1659,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"She came to grace the triumph of her lord,"
1660,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And pay him honours at his festive board.
1661,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1662,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Nine ruddy lasses follow'd where she stepp'd;
1663,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"White were their virgin robes, that lightly swept"
1664,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The downy grass; in every laughing eye
1665,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Cupid had skulk'd, and written ""victory."""
1666,ALFRED AND JENNET.,What heart on earth its homage could refuse?
1667,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Each tripp'd, unconsciously, a blushing Muse."
1668,ALFRED AND JENNET.,A slender chaplet of fresh blossoms bound
1669,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Their clustering ringlets in a magic round.
1670,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And, as they slowly moved across the green,"
1671,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Each in her beauty seem'd a May-day queen.
1672,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The first a wreath bore in her outstretch'd hand,"
1673,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The rest a single rose upon a wand;
1674,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Their steps were measured to that grassy throne
1675,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Where, watching them, Sir Ambrose sat alone."
1676,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"They stopp'd,--when she, the foremost of the row,"
1677,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Curtsied, and placed the wreath upon his brow;"
1678,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The rest, in order pacing by his bower,"
1679,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"In the loop'd wreath left each her single flower,--"
1680,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Then stood aside.--What broke the scene's repose?
1681,ALFRED AND JENNET.,The whole assembly clapp'd their hands and rose.
1682,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1683,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The Muses charm'd them as they form'd a ring,"
1684,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And look'd the very life and soul of Spring!
1685,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But still the white hair'd dame they view'd with pride,"
1686,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Her love so perfect, and her truth so tried."
1687,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Oh, sweet it is to hear, to see, to name,"
1688,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Unquench'd affection in the palsied frame--
1689,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"To think upon the boundless raptures past,"
1690,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And love, triumphant, conquering to the last!"
1691,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1692,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Silenced by feeling, vanquish'd by his tears,"
1693,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The host sprung up, nor felt the weight of years;"
1694,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Yet utterance found not, though in virtue's cause,"
1695,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But acclamations fill'd up nature's pause,"
1696,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Till, by one last and vigorous essay,"
1697,ALFRED AND JENNET.,His tide of feeling roll'd itself away;
1698,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The language of delight its bondage broke,"
1699,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And many a warm heart bless'd him as he spoke.
1700,ALFRED AND JENNET.,
1701,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Neighbours and friends, by long experience proved,"
1702,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Pardon this weakness; I was too much moved:"
1703,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""My dame, you see, can youth and age insnare,"
1704,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""In vain I strove, 'twas more than I could bear,--"
1705,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Yet hear me,--though the tyrant passions strive,"
1706,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""The words of truth, like leading stars, survive;"
1707,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I thank you all, but will accomplish more--"
1708,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Your verses shall not die as heretofore;"
1709,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Your local tales shall not be thrown away,"
1710,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Nor war remain the theme of every lay."
1711,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Ours is an humbler task, that may release"
1712,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""The high-wrought soul, and mould it into peace."
1713,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""These pastoral notes some victor's ear may fill,"
1714,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Breathed amidst blossoms, where the drum is still:"
1715,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""I purpose then to send them forth to try"
1716,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""The public patience, or its apathy."
1717,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""The world shall see them; why should I refrain?"
1718,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""'Tis all the produce of my own domain."
1719,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Farewell!"" he said, then took his lady's arm,"
1720,ALFRED AND JENNET.,On his shrunk hand her starting tears fell warm;
1721,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Again he turn'd to view the happy crowd,"
1722,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And cried, ""Good night, good night, good night,"" aloud,"
1723,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Health to you all! for see, the evening closes,"""
1724,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Then march'd to rest, beneath his crown of roses."
1725,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""Happy old man! with feelings such as these,"
1726,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"""The seasons all can charm, and trifles please."""
1727,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"An instantaneous shout re-echoed round,"
1728,ALFRED AND JENNET.,'Twas wine and gratitude inspired the sound:
1729,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Some joyous souls resumed the dance again,"
1730,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The aged loiter'd o'er the homeward plain,"
1731,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"And scatter'd lovers rambled through the park,"
1732,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And breathed their vows of honour in the dark;
1733,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Others a festal harmony preferr'd,"
1734,ALFRED AND JENNET.,Still round the thorn the jovial song was heard;
1735,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Dance, rhymes, and fame, they scorn'd such things as these,"
1736,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"But drain'd the mouldy barrel to its lees,"
1737,ALFRED AND JENNET.,As if 'twere worse than shame to want repose:
1738,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Nor was the lawn clear till the moon arose,"
1739,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And on each turret pour'd a brilliant gleam
1740,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"Of modest light, that trembled on the stream;"
1741,ALFRED AND JENNET.,"The owl awoke, but dared not yet complain,"
1742,ALFRED AND JENNET.,And banish'd silence re-assumed her reign.
