113,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD
114,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
115,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Matthew Arnold, poet and critic, was born in the village of Laleham,"
116,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Middlesex County, England, December 24, 1822. He was the son of Dr."
117,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Thomas Arnold, best remembered as the great Head Master at Rugby and"
118,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"in later years distinguished also as a historian of Rome, and of Mary"
119,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Penrose Arnold, a woman of remarkable character and intellect."
120,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
121,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Devoid of stirring incident, and, on the whole, free from the"
122,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"eccentricities so common to men of genius, the story of Arnold's life"
123,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"is soon told. As a boy he lived the life of the normal English lad,"
124,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,with its healthy routine of task and play. He was at school at both
125,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Laleham and Winchester, then at Rugby, where he attracted attention"
126,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,as a student and won a prize for poetry. In 1840 he was elected to
127,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"an open scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, and the next year"
128,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,matriculated for his university work. Arnold's career at Oxford was a
129,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,memorable one. While here he was associated with such men as John Duke
130,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Coleridge, John Shairp, Dean Fraser, Dean Church, John Henry Newman,"
131,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Thomas Hughes, the Froudes, and, closest of all, with Arthur Hugh"
132,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Clough, whose early death he lamented in his exquisite elegiac"
133,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"poem--_Thyrsis_. Among this brilliant company Arnold moved with ease,"
134,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,the recognized favorite. Having taken the Newdigate prize for English
135,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"verse, and also having won a scholarship, he was graduated with"
136,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"honors in 1844, and in March of the following year had the additional"
137,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"distinction of being elected a Fellow of Oriel, the crowning glory of"
138,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,an Oxford graduate. He afterward taught classics for a short time at
139,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Rugby, then in 1847 accepted the post of private secretary to the"
140,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord President of the Council, which position he"
141,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"occupied until 1851, when he was appointed Lay Inspector of Schools"
142,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,by the Committee on Education. The same year he married Frances Lucy
143,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Wightman, daughter of Sir William Wightman, judge of the Court of the"
144,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,Queen's Bench.
145,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
146,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,Arnold's record as an educator is unparalleled in the history of
147,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,England's public schools. For more than thirty-five years he served as
148,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"inspector and commissioner, which offices he filled with efficiency."
149,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"As inspector he was earnest, conscientious, versatile; beloved alike"
150,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,by teachers and pupils. The Dean of Salisbury likened his appearance
151,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"to inspect the school at Kiddermaster, to the admission of a ray"
152,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,of light when a shutter is suddenly opened in a darkened room.
153,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"All-in-all, he valued happy-appearing children, and kindly sympathetic"
154,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"teachers, more than excellence in grade reports. In connection with"
155,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"the duties of his office as commissioner, he travelled frequently on"
156,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,the Continent to inquire into foreign methods of primary and secondary
157,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"education. Here he found much that was worth while, and often carried"
158,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,back to London larger suggestions and ideas than the national mind was
159,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"ready to accept. Under his supervision, however, the school system of"
160,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,England was extensively revised and improved. He resigned his position
161,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"under the Committee of Council on Education, in 1886, two years before"
162,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,his death.
163,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
164,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,In the meantime Arnold's pen had not been idle. His first volume of
165,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"verse, _The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems_, appeared (1848), and"
166,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"although quietly received, slowly won its way into public favor. The"
167,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"next year the narrative poem, _The Sick King in Bokhara_, came out,"
168,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"and was followed in turn by a third volume in 1853, under the title of"
169,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,_Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems_. By this time Arnold's reputation
170,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"as a poet was established, and in 1857 he was elected Professor of"
171,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Poetry at Oxford, where he began his career as a lecturer, in which"
172,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"capacity he twice visited America. _Merope, a Tragedy_ (1856) and a"
173,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,volume under the title of _New Poems_ (1869) finish the list of his
174,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"poetical works, with the exception of occasional verses."
175,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
176,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Arnold's prose works, aside from his letters, consist wholly of"
177,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"critical essays, in which he has dealt fearlessly with the greater"
178,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,issues of his day. As will be seen by their titles (see page xxxviii
179,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"of this volume), the subject-matter of these essays is of very great"
180,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"scope, embracing in theme literature, politics, social conduct, and"
181,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,popular religion. By them Arnold has exerted a remarkable influence on
182,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,public thought and stamped himself as one of the ablest critics and
183,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,reformers of the last century. Arnold's life was thus one of many
184,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,widely diverse activities and was at all times deeply concerned with
185,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,practical as well as with literary affairs; and on no side was it
186,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,deficient in human sympathies and relations. He won respect and
187,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"reputation while he lived, and his works continue to attract men's"
188,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"minds, although with much unevenness. It has been said of him that, of"
189,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"all the modern poets, except Goethe, he was the best critic, and of"
190,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"all the modern critics, with the same exception, he was the best poet."
191,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"He died at Liverpool, where he had gone to meet his daughter returning"
192,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"from America, April 15, 1888. By his death the world lost an acute and"
193,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"cultured critic, a refined writer, an earnest educational reformer,"
194,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"and a noble man. He was buried in his native town, Laleham."
195,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
196,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Agreeably to his own request, Arnold has never been made the subject"
197,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"for a biography. By means of his letters, his official reports,"
198,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"and statements of his friends, however, one is able to trace the"
199,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"successive stages of his career, as he steadily grew in honor and"
200,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"public usefulness. Though somewhat inadequate, the picture thus"
201,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,presented is singularly pleasing and attractive. The subjoined
202,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,appreciations have been selected with a view of giving the student a
203,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,glimpse of Arnold as he appeared to unprejudiced minds.
204,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
205,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"One who knew him at Oxford wrote of him as follows: ""His perfect"
206,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"self-possession, the sallies of his ready wit, the humorous turn which"
207,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"he could give to any subject that he handled, his gaiety, audacity,"
208,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"and unfailing command of words, made him one of the most popular and"
209,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"successful undergraduates that Oxford has ever known."""
210,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
211,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"""He was beautiful as a young man, strong and manly, yet full of dreams"
212,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,and schemes. His Olympian manners began even at Oxford: there was no
213,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"harm in them: they were natural, not put on. The very sound of his"
214,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"voice and wave of his arm were Jove-like.""--PROFESSOR MAX MÜLLER."
215,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
216,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"""He was most distinctly on the side of human enjoyment. He conspired"
217,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,and contrived to make things pleasant. Pedantry he abhorred. He was
218,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,a man of this life and this world. A severe critic of this world he
219,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"indeed was; but, finding himself in it, and not precisely knowing what"
220,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"is beyond it, like a brave and true-hearted man, he set himself to"
221,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,make the best of it. Its sights and sounds were dear to him. The
222,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"'uncrumpling fern, the eternal moonlit snow,' the red grouse springing"
223,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"at our sound, the tinkling bells of the 'high-pasturing kine,' the"
224,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"vagaries of men, of women, and dogs, their odd ways and tricks,"
225,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"whether of mind or manner, all delighted, amused, tickled him."

228,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
229,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"""In a sense of the word which is noble and blessed, he was of the"
230,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,earth earthy.... His mind was based on the plainest possible things.
231,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"What he hated most was the fantastic--the far-fetched, all-elaborated"
232,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,fancies and strained interpretations. He stuck to the beaten track of
233,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"human experience, and the broader the better. He was a plain-sailing"
234,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"man. This is his true note.""--MR. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL."
235,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
236,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"""He was incapable of sacrificing the smallest interest of anybody to"
237,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,his own; he had not a spark of envy or jealousy; he stood well aloof
238,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,from all the bustlings and jostlings by which selfish men push on;
239,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,he bore life's disappointments--and he was disappointed in some
240,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,reasonable hopes--with good nature and fortitude; he cast no burden
241,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"upon others, and never shrank from bearing his own share of the daily"
242,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"load to the last ounce of it; he took the deepest, sincerest, and"
243,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,most active interest in the well-being of his country and his
244,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"countrymen.""--MR. JOHN MORLEY."
245,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
246,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"In his essay on Arnold, George E. Woodberry speaks of the poet's"
247,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,personality as revealed by his letters in the following beautiful
248,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"manner: ""Few who did not know Arnold could have been prepared for"
249,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"the revelation of a nature so true, so amiable, so dutiful. In every"
250,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,relation of private life he is shown to have been a man of exceptional
251,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,constancy and plainness.... Every one must take delight in the mental
252,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,association with Arnold in the scenes of his existence ... and in his
253,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"family affections. A nature warm to its own, kindly to all, cheerful,"
254,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"fond of sport and fun, and always fed from pure fountains, and with"
255,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"it a character so founded upon the rock, so humbly serviceable, so"
256,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"continuing in power and grace, must wake in all the responses of happy"
257,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,appreciation and leave the charm of memory.
258,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
259,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"""He did his duty as naturally as if it required neither resolve nor"
260,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"effort, nor thought of any kind for the morrow, and he never failed,"
261,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"seemingly, in act or word of sympathy, in little or great things; and"
262,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,when to this one adds the clear ether of the intellectual life where
263,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"he habitually moved in his own life apart, and the humanity of his"
264,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"home, the gift that these letters bring may be appreciated. That gift"
265,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"is the man himself, but set in the atmosphere of home, with sonship"
266,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"and fatherhood, sisters and brothers, with the bereavements of years"
267,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"fully accomplished, and those of babyhood and boyhood--a sweet and"
268,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"wholesome English home, with all the cloud and sunshine of the English"
269,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"world drifting over its roof-trees, and the soil of England beneath"
270,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"its stones, and English duties for the breath of its being. To add"
271,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,such a home to the household rights of English Literature is perhaps
272,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"something from which Arnold would have shrunk, but it endears his"
273,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"memory."""
274,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
275,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"""It may be overmuch"
276,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"He shunned the common stain and smutch,"
277,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,From soilure of ignoble touch
278,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Too grandly free,"
279,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,Too loftily secure in such
280,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,Cold purity;
281,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,But he preserved from chance control
282,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"The fortress of his established soul,"
283,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,In all things sought to see the whole;
284,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Brooked no disguise,"
285,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"And set his heart upon the goal,"
286,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,"Not on the prize."""

291,A SHORT LIFE OF ARNOLD,
292,ARNOLD THE POET,ARNOLD THE POET
293,ARNOLD THE POET,
294,ARNOLD THE POET,Matthew Arnold was essentially a man of the intellect. No other author
295,ARNOLD THE POET,"of modern times, perhaps no other English author of any time, appeals"
296,ARNOLD THE POET,so directly as he to the educated classes. Even a cursory reading of
297,ARNOLD THE POET,"his pages, prose or verse, reveals the scholar and the critic. He is"
298,ARNOLD THE POET,"always thinking, always brilliant, never lacks for a word or phrase;"
299,ARNOLD THE POET,"and on the whole, his judgments are good. Between his prose and verse,"
300,ARNOLD THE POET,"however, there is a marked difference, both in tone and spiritual"
301,ARNOLD THE POET,"quality. True, each possesses the note of a lofty, though stoical"
302,ARNOLD THE POET,courage; reveals the same grace of finish and exactness of phrase and
303,ARNOLD THE POET,"manner; and is, in equal degree, the output of a singularly sane and"
304,ARNOLD THE POET,"noble nature; but here the comparison ends; for, while his prose"
305,ARNOLD THE POET,"is often stormy and contentious, his poetry has always about it an"
306,ARNOLD THE POET,atmosphere of entire repose. The cause of this difference is not far
307,ARNOLD THE POET,"to seek. His poetry, written in early manhood, reflects his inner"
308,ARNOLD THE POET,"self, the more lovable side of his nature; while his prose presents"
309,ARNOLD THE POET,"the critic and the reformer, pointing out the good and bad, and"
310,ARNOLD THE POET,"permitting at times a spirit of bitterness to creep in, as he"
311,ARNOLD THE POET,endeavors to arouse men out of their easy contentment with themselves
312,ARNOLD THE POET,and their surroundings.
313,ARNOLD THE POET,
314,ARNOLD THE POET,"With the exception of occasional verses, Arnold's poetical career"
315,ARNOLD THE POET,began and ended inside of twenty years. The reason for this can only
316,ARNOLD THE POET,"be conjectured, and need not be dwelt upon here. But although his"
317,ARNOLD THE POET,"poetic life was brief, it was of a very high order, his poems ranking"
318,ARNOLD THE POET,well up among the literary productions of the last century. As a
319,ARNOLD THE POET,"popular poet, however, he will probably never class with Tennyson or"
320,ARNOLD THE POET,Longfellow. His poems are too coldly classical and too unattractive in
321,ARNOLD THE POET,"subject to appeal to the casual reader, who is, generally speaking,"
322,ARNOLD THE POET,inclined toward poetry of the emotions rather than of the
323,ARNOLD THE POET,"intellect--Arnold's usual kind. That he recognized this himself,"
324,ARNOLD THE POET,witness the following quiet statements made in letters to his friends:
325,ARNOLD THE POET,"""My poems are making their way, I think, though slowly, and are"
326,ARNOLD THE POET,"perhaps never to make way very far. There must always be some people,"
327,ARNOLD THE POET,"however, to whom the literalness and sincerity of them has a charm...."
328,ARNOLD THE POET,"They represent, on the whole, the main movement of mind of the last"
329,ARNOLD THE POET,"quarter of a century, and thus they will probably have their day, as"
330,ARNOLD THE POET,people become conscious to themselves of what that movement of mind
331,ARNOLD THE POET,"is, and interested in the literary productions which reflect it."" Time"
332,ARNOLD THE POET,"has verified the accuracy of this judgment. In short, Arnold has made"
333,ARNOLD THE POET,"a profound rather than a wide impression. To a few, however, of each"
334,ARNOLD THE POET,"generation, he will continue to be a ""voice oracular,""--a poet with a"
335,ARNOLD THE POET,purpose and a message.
336,ARNOLD THE POET,
337,ARNOLD THE POET,"=Arnold's Poetic Culture=.--Obviously, the sources of Arnold's culture"
338,ARNOLD THE POET,"were classical. As one critic has tersely said, ""He turned over his"
339,ARNOLD THE POET,"Greek models by day and by night."" Here he found his ideal standards,"
340,ARNOLD THE POET,and here he brought for comparison all questions that engrossed his
341,ARNOLD THE POET,thoughts. Homer (he replied to an inquirer) and Epictetus (of mood
342,ARNOLD THE POET,"congenial with his own) were props of his mind, as were Sophocles,"
343,ARNOLD THE POET,"""who saw life steadily and saw it whole,"" and Marcus Aurelius, whom he"
344,ARNOLD THE POET,called the purest of men. These like natures afforded him repose and
345,ARNOLD THE POET,consolation. Greek epic and dramatic poetry and Greek philosophy
346,ARNOLD THE POET,"appealed profoundly to him. Of the Greek poets he wrote: ""No other"
347,ARNOLD THE POET,poets have lived so much by the imaginative reason; no other poets
348,ARNOLD THE POET,have made their works so well balanced; no other poets have so well
349,ARNOLD THE POET,satisfied the thinking power; have so well satisfied the religious
350,ARNOLD THE POET,"sense."" More than any other English poet he prized the qualities of"
351,ARNOLD THE POET,"measure, proportion, and restraint; and to him lucidity, austerity,"
352,ARNOLD THE POET,"and high seriousness, conspicuous elements of classic verse, were the"
353,ARNOLD THE POET,substance of true poetry. In explaining his own position as to his
354,ARNOLD THE POET,"art, he says: ""In the sincere endeavor to learn and practise, amid the"
355,ARNOLD THE POET,"bewildering confusion of our times, what is sound and true in poetic"
356,ARNOLD THE POET,"art, I seem, to myself to find the only sure guidance, the only solid"
357,ARNOLD THE POET,"footing, among the ancients. They, at any rate, knew what they wanted"
358,ARNOLD THE POET,"in Art, and we do not. It is this uncertainty which is disheartening,"
359,ARNOLD THE POET,"and not hostile criticism."" And again: ""The radical difference between"
360,ARNOLD THE POET,"the poetic theory of the Greeks and our own is this: that with them,"
361,ARNOLD THE POET,"the poetical character of the action in itself, and the conduct of it,"
362,ARNOLD THE POET,"was the first consideration; with us, attention is fixed mainly on the"
363,ARNOLD THE POET,value of separate thoughts and images which occur in the treatment of
364,ARNOLD THE POET,an action. They regard the whole; we regard the parts. We have poems
365,ARNOLD THE POET,"which seem to exist merely for the sake of single lines and passages,"
366,ARNOLD THE POET,and not for the sake of producing any total impression. We have
367,ARNOLD THE POET,critics who seem to direct their attention merely to detached
368,ARNOLD THE POET,"expressions, to the language about the action, not the action itself."
369,ARNOLD THE POET,I verily believe that the majority of them do not believe that there
370,ARNOLD THE POET,is such a thing as a total impression to be derived from a poem at
371,ARNOLD THE POET,"all, or to be demanded from a poet. They will permit the poet to"
372,ARNOLD THE POET,"select any action he pleases, and to suffer that action to go as"
373,ARNOLD THE POET,"it will, provided he gratifies them with occasional bursts of fine"
374,ARNOLD THE POET,"writing, and with a show of isolated thoughts and images; that is,"
375,ARNOLD THE POET,"they permit him to leave their poetic sense ungratified, provided that"
376,ARNOLD THE POET,"he gratifies their rhetorical sense and their curiosity."""
377,ARNOLD THE POET,
378,ARNOLD THE POET,"Arnold has illustrated, with remarkable success, his ideas of that"
379,ARNOLD THE POET,"unity which gratifies the poetical sense, and has approached very"
380,ARNOLD THE POET,close to his Greek models in numerous instances; most notably so in
381,ARNOLD THE POET,"his great epic or narrative poem, _Sohrab and Rustum_, which is dealt"
382,ARNOLD THE POET,with elsewhere in this introduction. Perhaps we could not do better
383,ARNOLD THE POET,"than to quote for our consideration at this time, a fine synthesis"
384,ARNOLD THE POET,"of Mr. Arthur Galton. He says: ""In Matthew Arnold's style and in his"
385,ARNOLD THE POET,"manner, he seems to me to recall the great masters, and this in a"
386,ARNOLD THE POET,striking and in an abiding way.... To recall them at all is a rare
387,ARNOLD THE POET,"gift, but to recall them naturally, and with no strained sense nor"
388,ARNOLD THE POET,"jarring note of imitation, is a gift so exceedingly rare that it is"
389,ARNOLD THE POET,almost enough in itself to place a writer among the great masters; to
390,ARNOLD THE POET,"proclaim that he is one of them. To recall them at all is a rare gift,"
391,ARNOLD THE POET,though not a unique gift; a few other modern poets recall them too;
392,ARNOLD THE POET,"but with these, with every one of them, it is the exception when they"
393,ARNOLD THE POET,"resemble the great masters. They have their own styles, which abide"
394,ARNOLD THE POET,"with them; it is only now and then, by a flash of genius, that they"
395,ARNOLD THE POET,"break through their own styles, and attain the one immortal style."
396,ARNOLD THE POET,"Just the contrary of this is true of Matthew Arnold. It is his own,"
397,ARNOLD THE POET,"his usual, and his most natural style which recalls the great masters;"
398,ARNOLD THE POET,"and only when he does not write like himself, does he cease to"
399,ARNOLD THE POET,resemble them.... No man who attains to this great style can fail to
400,ARNOLD THE POET,"have a distinguished function; and Matthew Arnold, like Milton, will"
401,ARNOLD THE POET,"be 'a leaven and a power,' because he, too, has made the great style"
402,ARNOLD THE POET,"current in English. With his desire for culture and for perfection,"
403,ARNOLD THE POET,"there is no destiny he would prefer to this, for which his nature, his"
404,ARNOLD THE POET,"training, and his sympathies, all prepared him. To convey the message"
405,ARNOLD THE POET,"of those ancients whom he loved so well, in that English tongue which"
406,ARNOLD THE POET,he was taught by them to use so perfectly;--to serve as an eternal
407,ARNOLD THE POET,protest against charlatanism and vulgarity;--is exactly the mission
408,ARNOLD THE POET,"he would have chosen for himself.... The few writers of our language,"
409,ARNOLD THE POET,"therefore, who give us 'an ideal of excellence, the most high and the"
410,ARNOLD THE POET,"most rare,' have an important function; we should study their works"
411,ARNOLD THE POET,"continually, and it should be a matter of passionate concern with us,"
412,ARNOLD THE POET,"that the 'ideals,' that is, the definite and perfect models, should"
413,ARNOLD THE POET,"abide with us forever."" The Greeks recognized three kinds of"
414,ARNOLD THE POET,"poetry,--Lyric, Dramatic, and Epic. Arnold tried all three. First,"
415,ARNOLD THE POET,"then, as a lyricist."
416,ARNOLD THE POET,
417,ARNOLD THE POET,=Arnold as a Lyricist=.--Lyric poetry is the artistic expression of
418,ARNOLD THE POET,"the poet's individual sentiments and emotions, hence it is subjective."
419,ARNOLD THE POET,"The action is usually vapid, the verse musical, the time quick. Unlike"
420,ARNOLD THE POET,"the Epic and Drama, it has no preferred verse or meter, but leaves the"
421,ARNOLD THE POET,poet free to choose or invent appropriate forms. In this species of
422,ARNOLD THE POET,"verse Arnold was not wholly at ease. As has been said, one searches in"
423,ARNOLD THE POET,"vain through the whole course of his poetry for a blithe, musical, gay"
424,ARNOLD THE POET,"or serious, offhand poem, the true lyric kind. The reason for this is"
425,ARNOLD THE POET,"soon discovered. Obviously, it lies in the fundamental qualities"
426,ARNOLD THE POET,of the poet's mind and temperament. Though by no means lacking in
427,ARNOLD THE POET,"emotional sensibility, Arnold was too intellectually self-conscious to"
428,ARNOLD THE POET,be carried away by the impulsiveness common to the lyrical moods. With
429,ARNOLD THE POET,"him the intellect was always master; the emotions, subordinate. With"
430,ARNOLD THE POET,"the lyricist, the order is, in the main, at least, reversed. The poet"
431,ARNOLD THE POET,"throws off intellectual restraint, and ""lets his illumined being"
432,ARNOLD THE POET,"o'errun"" with music and song. This Arnold could not or would not"
433,ARNOLD THE POET,"do. Then, too, Arnold's lyrics are often at fault metrically."
434,ARNOLD THE POET,"This, combined with frequent questionable rhymes, argues a not too"
435,ARNOLD THE POET,discriminating poetical ear. He also lacked genius in inventing verse
436,ARNOLD THE POET,"forms, and hence found himself under the necessity of employing or"
437,ARNOLD THE POET,adapting those already in use. In this respect he was notably inferior
438,ARNOLD THE POET,"to Tennyson, many of whose measures are wholly his own. Again,"
439,ARNOLD THE POET,"considerable portions of his lyric verse consist merely of prose, cut"
440,ARNOLD THE POET,"into lines of different length, in imitation of the unrhymed measures"
441,ARNOLD THE POET,"of the Greek poet, Pindar. The Bishop of Derry, commenting on these"
442,ARNOLD THE POET,"rhythmic novelties, likens them to the sound of a stick drawn by a"
443,ARNOLD THE POET,"city gamin sharply across the area railings,--a not inapt comparison."
444,ARNOLD THE POET,"That they were not always successful, witness the following stanza"
445,ARNOLD THE POET,from _Merope_:--
446,ARNOLD THE POET,
447,ARNOLD THE POET,"""Thou confessest the prize"
448,ARNOLD THE POET,"In the rushing, blundering, mad,"
449,ARNOLD THE POET,"Cloud-enveloped, obscure,"
450,ARNOLD THE POET,"Unapplauded, unsung"
451,ARNOLD THE POET,"Race of Calamity, mine!"""
452,ARNOLD THE POET,
453,ARNOLD THE POET,"Surely this is but the baldest prose. At intervals, however, Arnold"
454,ARNOLD THE POET,"was nobly lyrical, and strangely, too, at times, in those same uneven"
455,ARNOLD THE POET,measures in which are found his most signal failures--the unrhymed
456,ARNOLD THE POET,Pindaric. _Philomela_ written in this style is one of the most
457,ARNOLD THE POET,"exquisite bits of verse in the language. As one critic has put it,"
458,ARNOLD THE POET,"""It ought to be written in silver and bound in gold."" In urbanity of"
459,ARNOLD THE POET,phrase and in depth of genuine pathos it is unsurpassed and shows
460,ARNOLD THE POET,"Arnold at his best. _Rugby Chapel, The Youth of Nature, The Youth of"
461,ARNOLD THE POET,"Man_, and _A Dream_ are good examples of his longer efforts in this"
462,ARNOLD THE POET,"verse form. In the more common lyric measures, Arnold was, at times,"
463,ARNOLD THE POET,"equally successful. Saintsbury, commenting on _Requiescat_, says that"
464,ARNOLD THE POET,"the poet has ""here achieved the triple union of simplicity, pathos,"
465,ARNOLD THE POET,"and (in the best sense) elegance""; and adds that there is not a"
466,ARNOLD THE POET,false note in the poem. He also speaks enthusiastically of the
467,ARNOLD THE POET,"""honey-dropping trochees"" of the _New Sirens_, and of the ""chiselled"
468,ARNOLD THE POET,"and classic perfection"" of the lines of _Resignation_. Herbert W."
469,ARNOLD THE POET,"Paul, writing of _Mycerinus_, declares that no such verse has been"
470,ARNOLD THE POET,"written in England since Wordsworth's _Laodamia_; and continues,"
471,ARNOLD THE POET,"""The poem abounds in single lines of haunting charm."" Among his more"
472,ARNOLD THE POET,"successful longer lyrics are _The Sick King in Bokhara, Switzerland,"
473,ARNOLD THE POET,"Faded Leaves_, and _Tristram and Iseult_, and _Epilogue to Lessing's"
474,ARNOLD THE POET,"Laocoön_, included in this volume."
475,ARNOLD THE POET,
476,ARNOLD THE POET,"=Arnold as a Dramatist=.--The drama is imitated human action, and is"
477,ARNOLD THE POET,"intended to exhibit a picture of human life by means of dialogue,"
478,ARNOLD THE POET,"acting, and stage accessories. In nature, it partakes of both lyric"
479,ARNOLD THE POET,"and epic, thus uniting sentiment and action with narration. Characters"
480,ARNOLD THE POET,"live and act before us, and speak in our presence, the interest being"
481,ARNOLD THE POET,kept up by constantly shifting situations tending toward some striking
482,ARNOLD THE POET,"result. As a dramatist, Arnold achieved no great success. Again the"
483,ARNOLD THE POET,fundamental qualities of his mind stood in the way. An author so
484,ARNOLD THE POET,"subjective, so absorbed in self-scrutiny and introspection as he,"
485,ARNOLD THE POET,is seldom able to project himself into the minds of others to any
486,ARNOLD THE POET,"considerable extent. His dramas are brilliant with beautiful phrases,"
487,ARNOLD THE POET,his pictures of landscapes and of nature in her various aspects
488,ARNOLD THE POET,"approach perfection; but in the main, he fails to handle his plots in"
489,ARNOLD THE POET,"a dramatic manner and, as a result, does not secure the totality of"
490,ARNOLD THE POET,"impression so vital to the drama. Frequently, too, his characters are"
491,ARNOLD THE POET,"tedious, and in their dialogue manage to be provokingly unnatural or"
492,ARNOLD THE POET,insipid. They also lack in individuality and independence in speech
493,ARNOLD THE POET,"and action. Many of his situations, likewise, are at fault. For"
494,ARNOLD THE POET,"instance, one can scarcely conceive of such characters as Ulysses and"
495,ARNOLD THE POET,Circe playing the subordinate roles assigned to them in _The Strayed
496,ARNOLD THE POET,Reveller_. A true dramatist would hardly have committed so flagrant a
497,ARNOLD THE POET,blunder. _Merope_ is written in imitation of the Greek tragedians. It
498,ARNOLD THE POET,"has dignity of subject, nobility of sentiment, and a classic brevity"
499,ARNOLD THE POET,"of style; but it is frigid and artificial, and fails in the most"
500,ARNOLD THE POET,essential function of drama--to stir the reader's emotions.
501,ARNOLD THE POET,"_Empedocles on Etna_, a half-autobiographical drama, is in some"
502,ARNOLD THE POET,"respects a striking poem. It is replete with brilliant passages, and"
503,ARNOLD THE POET,contains some of Arnold's best lyric verses and most beautiful nature
504,ARNOLD THE POET,"pictures; but the dialogue is colorless, the rhymes poor, the plot,"
505,ARNOLD THE POET,"such as it contains, but indifferently handled, and even Empedocles,"
506,ARNOLD THE POET,"the principal character, is frequently tedious and unnatural. Arnold's"
507,ARNOLD THE POET,dramas show that his forte was not in character-drawing nor in
508,ARNOLD THE POET,dialogue.
509,ARNOLD THE POET,
510,ARNOLD THE POET,=Arnold as a Writer of Epic and Elegy=.--Epic poetry narrates in grand
511,ARNOLD THE POET,style the achievements of heroes--the poet telling the story as if
512,ARNOLD THE POET,"present. It is simple in construction and uniform in meter, yet it"
513,ARNOLD THE POET,"admits of the dialogue and the episode, and though not enforcing a"
514,ARNOLD THE POET,moral it may hold one in solution. Elegiac poetry is plaintive in
515,ARNOLD THE POET,tone and expresses sorrow or lamentation. Both epic and elegy are
516,ARNOLD THE POET,"inevitably serious in mood, and slow and stately in action. In these"
517,ARNOLD THE POET,two forms of verse Arnold was at his best. Stockton pronounced _Sohrab
518,ARNOLD THE POET,and Rustum_ the noblest poem in the English language. Another critic
519,ARNOLD THE POET,"has said that ""it is the nearest analogue in English to the rapidity"
520,ARNOLD THE POET,"of action, plainness of thought, plainness of diction, and nobleness"
521,ARNOLD THE POET,"of Homer."" Combining, as it does, classic purity of style with"
522,ARNOLD THE POET,"romantic ardor of feeling, it stands a direct exemplification of"
523,ARNOLD THE POET,"Arnold's poetic theories, as set forth in the preface of his volume of"
524,ARNOLD THE POET,1853. Especially is it successful in emphasizing his idea of unity of
525,ARNOLD THE POET,"impression; ""while the truth of its oriental color, the deep pathos"
526,ARNOLD THE POET,"of the situation, the fire and intensity of the action, the strong"
527,ARNOLD THE POET,"conception of character, and the full, solemn music of the verse, make"
528,ARNOLD THE POET,"it unquestionably the masterpiece of Arnold's longer poems, among"
529,ARNOLD THE POET,which it is the largest in bulk and also the most ambitious in
530,ARNOLD THE POET,"scheme."" _Balder Dead_, a characteristic Arnoldian production, founded"
531,ARNOLD THE POET,"upon the Norse legend of Balder, Lok, and Hader, though not so great"
532,ARNOLD THE POET,"as _Sohrab and Rustum_, has much poetic worth and ranks high among its"
533,ARNOLD THE POET,"kind; and _Tristram and Iseult_, with its infinite tragedy, and _The"
534,ARNOLD THE POET,"Sick King in Bokhara_, gorgeous in oriental color, are rare examples"
535,ARNOLD THE POET,"of the lyrical epic. _The Forsaken Merman_ and _Saint Brandan_, which"
536,ARNOLD THE POET,"are dealt with elsewhere in this volume, are good examples of his"
537,ARNOLD THE POET,"shorter narrative poems. In _Thyrsis_, the beautiful threnody in which"
538,ARNOLD THE POET,"he celebrated his dead friend, Clough, Arnold gave to the world one of"
539,ARNOLD THE POET,"its greatest elegies. One finds in this poem and its companion piece,"
540,ARNOLD THE POET,"_The Scholar-Gipsy_, the same unity of classic form with romantic"
541,ARNOLD THE POET,feeling present in _Sohrab and Rustum_. Both are crystal-clear without
542,ARNOLD THE POET,"coldness, and restrained without loss of a full volume of power."
543,ARNOLD THE POET,"Mr. Saintsbury, writing of _The Scholar-Gipsy_, says: ""It has"
544,ARNOLD THE POET,"everything--a sufficient scheme, a definite meaning and purpose, a"
545,ARNOLD THE POET,"sustained and adequate command of poetical presentation, and passages"
546,ARNOLD THE POET,"and phrases of the most exquisite beauty;"" and no less praise is due"
547,ARNOLD THE POET,"_Thyrsis_. Other of his elegiac poems are _Heine's Grave, Stanzas from"
548,ARNOLD THE POET,"the Grande Chartreuse, Stanzas in Memory of the Author of ""Obermann,"""
549,ARNOLD THE POET,"Obermann Once More, Rugby Chapel_, and _Memorial Verses_, the two last"
550,ARNOLD THE POET,named being included in this volume. In such measures as are used in
551,ARNOLD THE POET,"these poems, in the long, stately, swelling measures, whose graver"
552,ARNOLD THE POET,"movements accord with a serious and elevated purpose, Arnold was most"
553,ARNOLD THE POET,at ease.
554,ARNOLD THE POET,
555,ARNOLD THE POET,=Greek Spirit in Arnold=.--But it is not alone in the fact that he
556,ARNOLD THE POET,"selects classic subjects, and writes after the manner of the great"
557,ARNOLD THE POET,"masters, that Arnold's affinity with the Greeks is manifested. His"
558,ARNOLD THE POET,"poems in spirit, as in form, reflect the moods common to the ancient"
559,ARNOLD THE POET,"Hellenes, ""One feels the (Greek) quality,"" writes George E. Woodberry,"
560,ARNOLD THE POET,"""not as a source, but as a presence. In Tennyson, Keats, and Shelley"
561,ARNOLD THE POET,"there was Greek influence, but in them the result was modern. In"
562,ARNOLD THE POET,"Arnold the antiquity remains--remains in mood, just as in Landor it"
563,ARNOLD THE POET,remains in form. The Greek twilight broods over all his poetry. It is
564,ARNOLD THE POET,"pagan in philosophic spirit, not Attic, but of later and stoical time;"
565,ARNOLD THE POET,"with the patience, endurance, suffering, not in the Christian types,"
566,ARNOLD THE POET,"but as they now seem to a post-Christian imagination, looking back to"
567,ARNOLD THE POET,"the past."" Even when his poems treat of modern or romantic subjects,"
568,ARNOLD THE POET,one is impressed with the feeling that he presents them with the same
569,ARNOLD THE POET,quality of imagination as would the Greek masters themselves: and in
570,ARNOLD THE POET,the same form.
571,ARNOLD THE POET,
572,ARNOLD THE POET,=Arnold's Attitude toward Nature=.--In his attitude toward Nature
573,ARNOLD THE POET,"Arnold is often compared to Wordsworth. A close study, however,"
574,ARNOLD THE POET,"reveals a wide difference, both in the way Nature appealed to them"
575,ARNOLD THE POET,and in their mood in her presence. To Arnold she offered a temporary
576,ARNOLD THE POET,"refuge from the doubts and distractions of our modern life,--a"
577,ARNOLD THE POET,"soothing, consoling, uplifting power; to Wordsworth she was an"
578,ARNOLD THE POET,"inspiration,--a presence that disturbed him ""with the joy of elevated"
579,ARNOLD THE POET,"thoughts."" Conscious of the help he found in her association, Arnold"
580,ARNOLD THE POET,urged all men to follow Nature's example; to possess their souls in
581,ARNOLD THE POET,"quietude, despite the storm and turmoil without. Pancoast says: ""He"
582,ARNOLD THE POET,"delights in leading us to contemplate the infinite calm of Nature,"
583,ARNOLD THE POET,beside which man's transitory woes are reduced to a mere fretful
584,ARNOLD THE POET,insignificance. All the beautiful poem of _Tristram and Iseult_ is
585,ARNOLD THE POET,built upon the skilful alternation of two themes. We pass from the
586,ARNOLD THE POET,"feverish, wasting, and ephemeral struggle of human passions and"
587,ARNOLD THE POET,"desire, into an atmosphere that shames its heat and fume by an"
588,ARNOLD THE POET,"immemorial coolness and repose;"" and the same comparison constitutes"
589,ARNOLD THE POET,the theme for a considerable portion of his poetical work. In his
590,ARNOLD THE POET,"method of approaching Nature, Arnold also differed widely from"
591,ARNOLD THE POET,"Wordsworth, in that he saw with the outward eye, that is objectively;"
592,ARNOLD THE POET,"while Wordsworth saw rather with the inward eye, or subjectively."
593,ARNOLD THE POET,In this Arnold is essentially Greek and more Tennysonian than
594,ARNOLD THE POET,"Wordsworthian. Many of his poems, in full or in part, are mere nature"
595,ARNOLD THE POET,"pictures, and are artistic in the extreme. The pictures of the Oxus"
596,ARNOLD THE POET,stream at the close of _Sohrab and Rustum_; the English garden in
597,ARNOLD THE POET,"_Thyrsis_; and the hunter on the arras, in _Tristram and Iseult_, are"
598,ARNOLD THE POET,all notable examples. This pictorial method Wordsworth seldom used.
599,ARNOLD THE POET,"In spirit, too, the poets differed widely. To Wordsworth, Nature was,"
600,ARNOLD THE POET,"first of all, the abiding place of God; but Arnold ""finds in the"
601,ARNOLD THE POET,wood and field no streaming forth of beauty and wisdom from the
602,ARNOLD THE POET,"fountainhead of beauty,"" no habitancy of Nature's God."
603,ARNOLD THE POET,
604,ARNOLD THE POET,=Arnold's Attitude toward Life=.--Arnold's attitude toward life has
605,ARNOLD THE POET,been dwelt upon in the appreciations under the biographical sketch in
606,ARNOLD THE POET,"this volume and need only briefly be summed up here. To him, human"
607,ARNOLD THE POET,life in its higher developments presented itself as a stern and
608,ARNOLD THE POET,strenuous affair; but he never faltered nor sought to escape from his
609,ARNOLD THE POET,"share of the burden. ""On the contrary, the prevailing note of his"
610,ARNOLD THE POET,"poetry is self-reliance; help must come from the soul itself, for"
611,ARNOLD THE POET,
612,ARNOLD THE POET,"""The fountains of life are all within."""
613,ARNOLD THE POET,
614,ARNOLD THE POET,He preaches fortitude and courage in the face of the mysterious and
615,ARNOLD THE POET,"the inevitable--a courage, indeed, forlorn and pathetic in the eyes of"
616,ARNOLD THE POET,"many--and he constantly takes refuge from the choking cares of life,"
617,ARNOLD THE POET,"in a kind of stoical resignation."" As a reformer, his function"
618,ARNOLD THE POET,"was especially to stir people up, to make them dissatisfied with"
619,ARNOLD THE POET,"themselves and their institutions, and to force them to think, to"
620,ARNOLD THE POET,become individual. Everywhere in his works one is confronted by his
621,ARNOLD THE POET,unvarying insistence upon the supremacy of conduct and duty. The
622,ARNOLD THE POET,"modern tendency to drift away from the old, established religious"
623,ARNOLD THE POET,faith was a matter of serious thought to him and led him to give to
624,ARNOLD THE POET,the world a rational creed that would satisfy the sceptics and attract
625,ARNOLD THE POET,the indifferent. We cannot do better than quote for our closing
626,ARNOLD THE POET,thought the following pregnant lines from the author's sonnet entitled
627,ARNOLD THE POET,_The Better Part_:--
628,ARNOLD THE POET,
629,ARNOLD THE POET,"""Hath man no second life? _Pitch this one high!_"
630,ARNOLD THE POET,"Sits there no judge in Heaven, our sin to see?"
631,ARNOLD THE POET,"_More strictly, then, the inward judge obey_!"
632,ARNOLD THE POET,Was Christ a man like us? _Ah! let us try
633,ARNOLD THE POET,"If we then, too, can be such men as he!_"""

640,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,
641,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,The following extracts on Arnold as a critic are quoted from
642,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,well-known authorities.
643,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,
644,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"""Arnold's prose has little trace of the wistful melancholy of his"
645,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"verse. It is almost always urbane, vivacious, light-hearted. The"
646,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"classical bent of his mind shows itself here, unmixed with the"
647,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,inheritance of romantic feeling which colors his poetry. Not only is
648,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"his prose classical in quality, by virtue of its restraint, of its"
649,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"definite aim, and of the dry white light of intellect which suffuses"
650,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,it; but the doctrine which he spent his life in preaching is based
651,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"upon a classical ideal, the ideal of symmetry, wholeness, or, as he"
652,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"daringly called it, _perfection_.... Wherever, in religion, politics,"
653,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"education, or literature, he saw his countrymen under the domination"
654,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"of narrow ideals, he came speaking the mystic word of deliverance,"
655,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"'Culture.' Culture, acquaintance with the best which has been thought"
656,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"and done in the world, is his panacea for all ills.... In almost all"
657,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"of his prose writing he attacks some form of 'Philistinism,' by which"
658,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,word he characterized the narrow-mindedness and self-satisfaction of
659,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,the British middle class.
660,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,
661,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"""Arnold's tone is admirably fitted to the peculiar task he had to"
662,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"perform.... In _Culture and Anarchy_ and many successive works, he"
663,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"made his plea for the gospel of ideas with urbanity and playful grace,"
664,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"as befitted the Hellenic spirit, bringing 'sweetness and light' into"
665,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"the dark places of British prejudice. Sometimes, as in _Literature and"
666,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"Dogma_, where he pleads for a more liberal and literary reading of the"
667,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"Bible, his manner is quiet, suave, and gently persuasive. At other"
668,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"times, as in _Friendship's Garland_, he shoots the arrows of his"
669,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,sarcasm into the ranks of the Philistines with a delicate raillery and
670,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"scorn, all the more exasperating to his foes, because it is veiled by"
671,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"a mock humility, and is scrupulously polite."
672,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,
673,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"""Of Arnold's literary criticism, the most notable single piece is the"
674,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"famous essay _On Translating Homer_, which deserves careful study"
675,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,for the enlightenment it offers concerning many of the fundamental
676,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,questions of style. The essays on Wordsworth and on Byron from _Essays
677,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"in Criticism_, and that on Emerson, from _Discourses in America_,"
678,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,furnish good examples of Arnold's charm of manner and weight of matter
679,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,in this province.
680,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,
681,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"""The total impression which Arnold makes in his prose may be described"
682,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"as that of a spiritual man-of-the-world. In comparison with Carlyle,"
683,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"Buskin, and Newman, he is worldly. For the romantic passion and mystic"
684,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"vision of these men he substitutes an ideal of balanced cultivation,"
685,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"the ideal of the trained, sympathetic, cosmopolitan gentleman. He"
686,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,marks a return to the conventions of life after the storm and stress
687,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,of the romantic age. Yet in his own way he also was a prophet and a
688,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"preacher, striving whole-heartedly to release his countrymen from"
689,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"bondage to mean things, and pointing their gaze to that symmetry and"
690,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,balance of character which has seemed to many noble minds the true
691,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"goal of human endeavor.""--MOODY AND LOVETT, _A History of English"
692,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,Literature_.
693,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,
694,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"""As a literary critic, his taste, his temper, his judgment were pretty"
695,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,nearly infallible. He combined a loyal and reasonable submission
696,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"to literary authority, with a free and even daring use of private"
697,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,judgment. His admiration for the acknowledged masters of human
698,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"utterance--Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, Goethe--was genuine"
699,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"and enthusiastic, and incomparably better informed than that of some"
700,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,more conventional critics. Yet this cordial submission to recognized
701,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"authority, this honest loyalty to established reputation, did not"
702,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,blind him to defects; did not seduce him into indiscriminating praise;
703,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,did not deter him from exposing the tendency to verbiage in Burke and
704,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"Jeremy Taylor, the excess blankness of much of Wordsworth's blank"
705,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"verse, the undercurrent of mediocrity in Macaulay, the absurdities of"
706,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"Mr. Ruskin's etymology. And as in great matters, so in small. Whatever"
707,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"literary production was brought under Matthew Arnold's notice, his"
708,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"judgment was clear, sympathetic, and independent. He had the readiest"
709,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"appreciation of true excellence, a quick intolerance of turgidity and"
710,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,inflation--of what he called endeavors to render platitude endurable
711,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"by making it pompous, and lively horror of affectation and"
712,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"unreality.""--Mr. GEORGE RUSSELL."
713,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,
714,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"""In his work as literary critic Arnold has occupied a high place"
715,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,among the foremost prose writers of the time. His style is in marked
716,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"contrast to the dithyrambic eloquence of Carlyle, or to Ruskin's"
717,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"pure and radiant coloring. It is a quiet style, restrained, clear,"
718,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"discriminating, incisive, with little glow of ardor or passion."
719,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"Notwithstanding its scrupulous assumption of urbanity, it is often"
720,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"a merciless style, indescribably irritating to an opponent by"
721,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"its undercurrent of sarcastic humor, and its calm air of assured"
722,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,superiority. By his insistence on a high standard of technical
723,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"excellence, and by his admirable presentation of certain principles of"
724,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"literary judgment, Arnold performed a great work for literature. On"
725,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"the other hand, we miss here, as in his poetry, the human element, the"
726,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,comprehensive sympathy that we recognize in the criticism of Carlyle.
727,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"Yet Carlyle could not have written the essay _On Translating Homer_,"
728,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"with all its scholarly discrimination in style and technique, any"
729,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,more than Arnold could have produced Carlyle's large-hearted essay on
730,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,_Burns_. Arnold's varied energy and highly trained intelligence
731,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,have been felt in many different fields. He has won a peculiar and
732,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,honorable place in the poetry of the century; he has excelled as
733,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"literary critic, he has labored in the cause of education, and"
734,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"finally, in his _Culture and Anarchy_, he has set forth his scheme of"
735,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"social reform, and in certain later books has made His contribution"
736,ARNOLD THE CRITIC,"to contemporary thought.""--PANCOAST, _Introduction to English"

1029,AN EPISODE,"I came among the Tartars and bore arms,"
1030,AN EPISODE,"I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,"
1031,AN EPISODE,"At my boy's years,° the courage of a man.                            °45"
1032,AN EPISODE,"This too thou know'st, that while I still bear on"
1033,AN EPISODE,"The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,"
1034,AN EPISODE,"And beat the Persians back on every field,"
1035,AN EPISODE,"I seek one man, one man, and one alone--"
1036,AN EPISODE,"Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,                          50"
1037,AN EPISODE,"Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,"
1038,AN EPISODE,"His not unworthy, not inglorious son."
1039,AN EPISODE,"So I long hoped, but him I never find."
1040,AN EPISODE,"Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask."
1041,AN EPISODE,Let the two armies rest to-day; but I                                 55
1042,AN EPISODE,Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords
1043,AN EPISODE,"To meet me, man to man; if I prevail,"
1044,AN EPISODE,Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall--
1045,AN EPISODE,"Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin."
1046,AN EPISODE,"Dim is the rumour of a common fight,°                                °60"
1047,AN EPISODE,"Where host meets host, and many names are sunk°;                     °61"
1048,AN EPISODE,"But of a single combat fame speaks clear."""
1049,AN EPISODE,
1050,AN EPISODE,He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand
1051,AN EPISODE,"Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:--"
1052,AN EPISODE,
1053,AN EPISODE,"""O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!                                 65"
1054,AN EPISODE,"Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,"
1055,AN EPISODE,And share the battle's common chance° with us                        °67
1056,AN EPISODE,"Who love thee, but must press for ever first,"
1057,AN EPISODE,"In single fight incurring single risk,"
1058,AN EPISODE,To find a father thou hast never seen°?                              °70
1059,AN EPISODE,"That were far best, my son, to stay with us"
1060,AN EPISODE,"Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,"
1061,AN EPISODE,"And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns."
1062,AN EPISODE,"But, if this one desire indeed rules all,"
1063,AN EPISODE,To seek out Rustum--seek him not through fight!                       75
1064,AN EPISODE,"Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,"
1065,AN EPISODE,"O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!"
1066,AN EPISODE,"But far hence seek him, for he is not here."
1067,AN EPISODE,"For now it is not as when I was young,"
1068,AN EPISODE,When Rustum was in front of every fray;                               80
1069,AN EPISODE,"But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,"
1070,AN EPISODE,"In Seistan,° with Zal, his father old.                               °82"
1071,AN EPISODE,Whether that his own mighty strength at last
1072,AN EPISODE,"Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,"
1073,AN EPISODE,Or in some quarrel° with the Persian King.°                          °85
1074,AN EPISODE,There go°!--Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes                    °86
1075,AN EPISODE,Danger or death awaits thee on this field.
1076,AN EPISODE,"Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost"
1077,AN EPISODE,"To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace"
1078,AN EPISODE,"To seek thy father, not seek single fights                            90"
1079,AN EPISODE,In vain;--but who can keep the lion's cub
1080,AN EPISODE,"From ravening, and who govern Rustum's son?"
1081,AN EPISODE,"Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires."""
1082,AN EPISODE,
1083,AN EPISODE,"So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left"
1084,AN EPISODE,"His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;                            95"
1085,AN EPISODE,And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat
1086,AN EPISODE,"He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,"
1087,AN EPISODE,"And threw a white cloak round him, and he took"
1088,AN EPISODE,"In his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword°;                        °99"
1089,AN EPISODE,"And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,                           100"
1090,AN EPISODE,"Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul°;                     °101"
1091,AN EPISODE,"And raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd"
1092,AN EPISODE,"His herald to his side, and went abroad."
1093,AN EPISODE,
1094,AN EPISODE,"The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog"
1095,AN EPISODE,From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.                        105
1096,AN EPISODE,And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed
1097,AN EPISODE,Into the open plain; so Haman° bade--                               °107
1098,AN EPISODE,"Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled"
1099,AN EPISODE,"The host, and still was in his lusty prime."
1100,AN EPISODE,"From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;"
1101,AN EPISODE,"As when some grey November morn the files,                           111"
1102,AN EPISODE,"In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes"
1103,AN EPISODE,Stream over Casbin° and the southern slopes                         °113
1104,AN EPISODE,"Of Elburz,° from the Aralian estuaries,                             °114"
1105,AN EPISODE,"Or some frore° Caspian reed-bed, southward bound                    °115"
1106,AN EPISODE,For the warm Persian sea-board--so they stream'd.
1107,AN EPISODE,"The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,"
1108,AN EPISODE,"First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;"
1109,AN EPISODE,"Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara° come                     °119"
1110,AN EPISODE,"And Khiva,° and ferment the milk of mares.°                         °120"
1111,AN EPISODE,"Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns° of the south,                   °121"
1112,AN EPISODE,"The Tukas,° and the lances of Salore,                               °122"
1113,AN EPISODE,And those from Attruck° and the Caspian sands;                      °123
1114,AN EPISODE,"Light men and on light steeds, who only drink"
1115,AN EPISODE,"The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.                           125"
1116,AN EPISODE,"And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came"
1117,AN EPISODE,"From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;"
1118,AN EPISODE,"The Tartars of Ferghana,° from the banks                            °128"
1119,AN EPISODE,"Of the Jaxartes,° men with scanty beards                            °129"
1120,AN EPISODE,And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes                    130
1121,AN EPISODE,"Who roam o'er Kipchak° and the northern waste,                      °131"
1122,AN EPISODE,"Kalmucks° and unkempt Kuzzaks,° tribes who stray                    °132"
1123,AN EPISODE,"Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,°                        °133"
1124,AN EPISODE,Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;
1125,AN EPISODE,These all filed out from camp into the plain.                        135
1126,AN EPISODE,And on the other side the Persians form'd;--
1127,AN EPISODE,"First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd."
1128,AN EPISODE,"The Ilyats of Khorassan°; and behind,                               °138"
1129,AN EPISODE,"The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,"
1130,AN EPISODE,Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel.                     140
1131,AN EPISODE,"But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,"
1132,AN EPISODE,"Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,"
1133,AN EPISODE,And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.
1134,AN EPISODE,"And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw"
1135,AN EPISODE,"That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,                               145"
1136,AN EPISODE,"He took his spear, and to the front he came,"
1137,AN EPISODE,"And check'd his ranks, and fix'd° them where they stood.            °147"
1138,AN EPISODE,And the old Tartar came upon the sand
1139,AN EPISODE,"Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:--"
1140,AN EPISODE,
1141,AN EPISODE,"""Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!                         150"
1142,AN EPISODE,Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.
1143,AN EPISODE,But choose a champion from the Persian lords
1144,AN EPISODE,"To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man."""
1145,AN EPISODE,
1146,AN EPISODE,"As, in the country, on a morn in June,"
1147,AN EPISODE,"When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,                           155"
1148,AN EPISODE,A shiver runs through the deep corn° for joy--                      °156
1149,AN EPISODE,"So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,"
1150,AN EPISODE,A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran
1151,AN EPISODE,"Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved."
1152,AN EPISODE,
1153,AN EPISODE,"But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,°                            °160"
1154,AN EPISODE,"Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,°                              °161"
1155,AN EPISODE,That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;
1156,AN EPISODE,"Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass"
1157,AN EPISODE,"Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,"
1158,AN EPISODE,"Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves                    165"
1159,AN EPISODE,Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries--
1160,AN EPISODE,"In single file they move, and stop their breath,"
1161,AN EPISODE,For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows--
1162,AN EPISODE,So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.
1163,AN EPISODE,
1164,AN EPISODE,And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up                             170
1165,AN EPISODE,"To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,"
1166,AN EPISODE,"And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host"
1167,AN EPISODE,"Second, and was the uncle of the King°;                             °173"
1168,AN EPISODE,"These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:--"
1169,AN EPISODE,
1170,AN EPISODE,"""Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,                      175"
1171,AN EPISODE,Yet champion have we none to match this youth.
1172,AN EPISODE,"He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart.°                     °177"
1173,AN EPISODE,But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits°                          °178
1174,AN EPISODE,"And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart."
1175,AN EPISODE,"Him will I seek, and carry to his ear                                180"
1176,AN EPISODE,"The Tartar challenge, and this young man's name."
1177,AN EPISODE,"Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight."
1178,AN EPISODE,"Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up."""
1179,AN EPISODE,
1180,AN EPISODE,So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:--
1181,AN EPISODE,"""Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!                            185"
1182,AN EPISODE,"Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man."""
1183,AN EPISODE,"He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode"
1184,AN EPISODE,Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.
1185,AN EPISODE,"But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,"
1186,AN EPISODE,"And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,                  190"
1187,AN EPISODE,"Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents."
1188,AN EPISODE,"Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,"
1189,AN EPISODE,Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst
1190,AN EPISODE,"Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around."
1191,AN EPISODE,"And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found                          195"
1192,AN EPISODE,"Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still"
1193,AN EPISODE,"The table stood before him, charged with food--"
1194,AN EPISODE,"A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread;"
1195,AN EPISODE,And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate°                       °199
1196,AN EPISODE,"Listless, and held a falcon° on his wrist,                          °200"
1197,AN EPISODE,And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood
1198,AN EPISODE,"Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,"
1199,AN EPISODE,"And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,"
1200,AN EPISODE,"And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:--"
1201,AN EPISODE,
1202,AN EPISODE,"""Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.                      205"
1203,AN EPISODE,"What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink."""
1204,AN EPISODE,
1205,AN EPISODE,"But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:--"
1206,AN EPISODE,"""Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,"
1207,AN EPISODE,But not to-day; to-day has other needs.
1208,AN EPISODE,"The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;                         210"
1209,AN EPISODE,For from the Tartars is a challenge brought
1210,AN EPISODE,To pick a champion from the Persian lords
1211,AN EPISODE,To fight their champion--and thou know'st his name--
1212,AN EPISODE,"Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid."
1213,AN EPISODE,"O Rustum, like thy might is this young man's!                        215"
1214,AN EPISODE,"He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;"
1215,AN EPISODE,"And he is young, and Iran's° chiefs are old,                        °217"
1216,AN EPISODE,Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.
1217,AN EPISODE,"Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!"""
1218,AN EPISODE,
1219,AN EPISODE,He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:--                       220
1220,AN EPISODE,"""Go to°! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I                           °221"
1221,AN EPISODE,"Am older; if the young are weak, the King"
1222,AN EPISODE,"Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,°                     °223"
1223,AN EPISODE,"Himself is young, and honours younger men,"
1224,AN EPISODE,And lets the aged moulder to their graves.                           225
1225,AN EPISODE,"Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young--"
1226,AN EPISODE,"The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I."
1227,AN EPISODE,"For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?"
1228,AN EPISODE,"For would that I myself had such a son,"
1229,AN EPISODE,And not that one slight helpless girl° I have--                     °230
1230,AN EPISODE,"A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,"
1231,AN EPISODE,"And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,°                           °232"
1232,AN EPISODE,"My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,"
1233,AN EPISODE,"And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,"
1234,AN EPISODE,And he has none to guard his weak old age.                           235
1235,AN EPISODE,"There would I go, and hang my armour up,"
1236,AN EPISODE,"And with my great name fence that weak old man,"
1237,AN EPISODE,"And spend the goodly treasures I have got,"
1238,AN EPISODE,"And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,"
1239,AN EPISODE,"And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,                     240"
1240,AN EPISODE,"And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more."""
1241,AN EPISODE,
1242,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:--"
1243,AN EPISODE,"""What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,"
1244,AN EPISODE,"When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks"
1245,AN EPISODE,"Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,                      245"
1246,AN EPISODE,Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:
1247,AN EPISODE,"_Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,"
1248,AN EPISODE,"And shuns to peril it with younger men.""_°                          °248"
1249,AN EPISODE,
1250,AN EPISODE,"And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:--"
1251,AN EPISODE,"""O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?                       250"
1252,AN EPISODE,Thou knowest better words than this to say.
1253,AN EPISODE,"What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,"
1254,AN EPISODE,"Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?"
1255,AN EPISODE,"Are not they mortal, am not I myself?"
1256,AN EPISODE,But who for men of nought would do great deeds?                      255
1257,AN EPISODE,"Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!"
1258,AN EPISODE,"But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms°;                       °257"
1259,AN EPISODE,"Let not men say of Rustum, he was match'd"
1260,AN EPISODE,"In single fight with any mortal man."""
1261,AN EPISODE,
1262,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran                    260"
1263,AN EPISODE,Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy--
1264,AN EPISODE,"Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came."
1265,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd"
1266,AN EPISODE,"His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,"
1267,AN EPISODE,And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose                         265
1268,AN EPISODE,"Were plain, and on his shield was no device,°                       °266"
1269,AN EPISODE,"Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,"
1270,AN EPISODE,"And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume"
1271,AN EPISODE,"Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume."
1272,AN EPISODE,"So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,                     270"
1273,AN EPISODE,Follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel--
1274,AN EPISODE,"Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,"
1275,AN EPISODE,"The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once"
1276,AN EPISODE,Did in Bokhara by the river find
1277,AN EPISODE,"A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,                          275"
1278,AN EPISODE,"And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,"
1279,AN EPISODE,Dight° with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green                       °277
1280,AN EPISODE,"Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd"
1281,AN EPISODE,"All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know."
1282,AN EPISODE,"So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd                      280"
1283,AN EPISODE,"The camp, and to the Persian host appear'd."
1284,AN EPISODE,"And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts"
1285,AN EPISODE,Hail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.
1286,AN EPISODE,And dear as the wet diver to the eyes
1287,AN EPISODE,"Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,                       285"
1288,AN EPISODE,"By sandy Bahrein,° in the Persian Gulf,                             °286"
1289,AN EPISODE,"Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,"
1290,AN EPISODE,"Having made up his tale° of precious pearls,                        °288"
1291,AN EPISODE,Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands--
1292,AN EPISODE,So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.                            290
1293,AN EPISODE,
1294,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum to the Persian front advanced,"
1295,AN EPISODE,"And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came."
1296,AN EPISODE,And as afield the reapers cut a swath
1297,AN EPISODE,"Down through the middle of a rich man's corn,"
1298,AN EPISODE,"And on each side are squares of standing corn,                       295"
1299,AN EPISODE,"And in the midst a stubble, short and bare--"
1300,AN EPISODE,"So on each side were squares of men, with spears"
1301,AN EPISODE,"Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand."
1302,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast"
1303,AN EPISODE,"His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw                            300"
1304,AN EPISODE,"Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came."
1305,AN EPISODE,
1306,AN EPISODE,"As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,"
1307,AN EPISODE,Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge
1308,AN EPISODE,Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire--
1309,AN EPISODE,"At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,                            305"
1310,AN EPISODE,When the frost flowers° the whiten'd window-panes--
1311,AN EPISODE,"And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts"
1312,AN EPISODE,Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed
1313,AN EPISODE,"The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar"
1314,AN EPISODE,"Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth                               310"
1315,AN EPISODE,All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused°                       °311
1316,AN EPISODE,"His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was."
1317,AN EPISODE,"For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;"
1318,AN EPISODE,"Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,"
1319,AN EPISODE,Which in a queen's secluded garden throws                            315
1320,AN EPISODE,"Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,"
1321,AN EPISODE,"By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound--"
1322,AN EPISODE,"So slender Sohrab seem'd,° so softly rear'd.                        °318"
1323,AN EPISODE,And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul
1324,AN EPISODE,"As he beheld him coming; and he stood,                               320"
1325,AN EPISODE,"And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:--"
1326,AN EPISODE,
1327,AN EPISODE,"""O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,"
1328,AN EPISODE,"And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!"
1329,AN EPISODE,Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.
1330,AN EPISODE,"Behold me! I am vast,° and clad in iron,                            °325"
1331,AN EPISODE,And tried°; and I have stood on many a field
1332,AN EPISODE,"Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe--"
1333,AN EPISODE,"Never was that field lost, or that foe saved.°                      °327"
1334,AN EPISODE,"O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?"
1335,AN EPISODE,"Be govern'd°! quit the Tartar host, and come                        °330"
1336,AN EPISODE,"To Iran, and be as my son to me,"
1337,AN EPISODE,And fight beneath my banner till I die!
1338,AN EPISODE,"There are no youths in Iran brave as thou."""
1339,AN EPISODE,
1340,AN EPISODE,"So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,"
1341,AN EPISODE,"The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw                               335"
1342,AN EPISODE,"His giant figure planted on the sand,"
1343,AN EPISODE,"Sole, like some single tower, which a chief"
1344,AN EPISODE,Hath builded on the waste in former years
1345,AN EPISODE,"Against the robbers; and he saw that head,"
1346,AN EPISODE,"Streak'd with its first grey hairs;--hope filled his soul,           340"
1347,AN EPISODE,"And he ran forward and embraced his knees,"
1348,AN EPISODE,"And clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:--"
1349,AN EPISODE,
1350,AN EPISODE,"""O, by thy father's head°! by thine own soul!                       °343"
1351,AN EPISODE,"Art thou not Rustum°? speak! art thou not he?""                      °344"
1352,AN EPISODE,
1353,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,                          345"
1354,AN EPISODE,"And turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:--"
1355,AN EPISODE,
1356,AN EPISODE,"""Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!"
1357,AN EPISODE,"False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys."
1358,AN EPISODE,"For if I now confess this thing he asks,"
1359,AN EPISODE,"And hide it not, but say: _Rustum is here_!                          350"
1360,AN EPISODE,"He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,"
1361,AN EPISODE,"But he will find some pretext not to fight,"
1362,AN EPISODE,"And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts"
1363,AN EPISODE,"A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way."
1364,AN EPISODE,"And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,                             355"
1365,AN EPISODE,"In Samarcand, he will arise and cry:"
1366,AN EPISODE,"'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd"
1367,AN EPISODE,"Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords"
1368,AN EPISODE,To cope with me in single fight; but they
1369,AN EPISODE,"Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I                             360"
1370,AN EPISODE,"Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.'"
1371,AN EPISODE,"So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;"
1372,AN EPISODE,"Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me."""
1373,AN EPISODE,
1374,AN EPISODE,"And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:--"
1375,AN EPISODE,"""Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus                      365"
1376,AN EPISODE,"Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd"
1377,AN EPISODE,"By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt,° or yield!                 °367"
1378,AN EPISODE,Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?
1379,AN EPISODE,"Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee!"
1380,AN EPISODE,"For well I know, that did great Rustum stand                         370"
1381,AN EPISODE,"Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd,"
1382,AN EPISODE,There would be then no talk of fighting more.
1383,AN EPISODE,"But being what I am, I tell thee this--"
1384,AN EPISODE,Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:
1385,AN EPISODE,"Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,                      375"
1386,AN EPISODE,"Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds"
1387,AN EPISODE,"Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,"
1388,AN EPISODE,"Oxus in summer wash them all away."""
1389,AN EPISODE,
1390,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:--"
1391,AN EPISODE,"""Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so°!                   °380"
1392,AN EPISODE,I am no girl to be made pale by words.
1393,AN EPISODE,"Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand"
1394,AN EPISODE,"Here on this field, there were no fighting then."
1395,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here."
1396,AN EPISODE,"Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,                        385"
1397,AN EPISODE,"And thou art proved, I know, and I am young--"
1398,AN EPISODE,But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.
1399,AN EPISODE,And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure
1400,AN EPISODE,"Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know."
1401,AN EPISODE,"For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,                            390"
1402,AN EPISODE,"Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,"
1403,AN EPISODE,Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall.
1404,AN EPISODE,"And whether it will heave us up to land,"
1405,AN EPISODE,"Or whether it will roll us out to sea,"
1406,AN EPISODE,"Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,                         395"
1407,AN EPISODE,"We know not, and no search will make us know;"
1408,AN EPISODE,"Only the event will teach us in its hour."""
1409,AN EPISODE,
1410,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd"
1411,AN EPISODE,"His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,"
1412,AN EPISODE,"As on some partridge, in the corn a hawk,                            400"
1413,AN EPISODE,"That long has tower'd° in the airy clouds,                          °401"
1414,AN EPISODE,"Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,"
1415,AN EPISODE,"And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear"
1416,AN EPISODE,"Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,"
1417,AN EPISODE,Which it sent flying wide;--then Sohrab threw                        405
1418,AN EPISODE,"In turn, and full struck° Rustum's shield; sharp rang,              °406"
1419,AN EPISODE,"The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear."
1420,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum seized his club, which none but he"
1421,AN EPISODE,"Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,"
1422,AN EPISODE,Still rough--like those which men in treeless plains                 410
1423,AN EPISODE,"To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,"
1424,AN EPISODE,"Hyphasis° or Hydaspes,° when, high up                               °412"
1425,AN EPISODE,"By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time"
1426,AN EPISODE,"Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,°                              °414"
1427,AN EPISODE,And strewn the channels with torn boughs--so huge                    415
1428,AN EPISODE,"The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck"
1429,AN EPISODE,"One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,"
1430,AN EPISODE,"Lithe as the glancing° snake, and the club came                     °418"
1431,AN EPISODE,"Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand."
1432,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell                           420"
1433,AN EPISODE,"To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;"
1434,AN EPISODE,"And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,"
1435,AN EPISODE,And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay
1436,AN EPISODE,"Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;"
1437,AN EPISODE,"But he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,                   425"
1438,AN EPISODE,"But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:--"
1439,AN EPISODE,
1440,AN EPISODE,"""Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float"
1441,AN EPISODE,"Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones."
1442,AN EPISODE,"But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;"
1443,AN EPISODE,"No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.                         430"
1444,AN EPISODE,"Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!"
1445,AN EPISODE,"Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?"
1446,AN EPISODE,"Boy as I am, I have seen battles too--"
1447,AN EPISODE,"Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,"
1448,AN EPISODE,And heard their hollow° roar of dying men;                          °435
1449,AN EPISODE,But never was my heart thus touch'd before.
1450,AN EPISODE,"Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?"
1451,AN EPISODE,"O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!"
1452,AN EPISODE,"Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,"
1453,AN EPISODE,"And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,                            440"
1454,AN EPISODE,"And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,"
1455,AN EPISODE,And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.
1456,AN EPISODE,"There are enough foes in the Persian host,"
1457,AN EPISODE,"Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;"
1458,AN EPISODE,"Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou                             445"
1459,AN EPISODE,"Mayst fight; fight _them_, when they confront thy spear!"
1460,AN EPISODE,"But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!"""
1461,AN EPISODE,
1462,AN EPISODE,"He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,"
1463,AN EPISODE,"And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club"
1464,AN EPISODE,"He left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,                          450"
1465,AN EPISODE,Whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand
1466,AN EPISODE,"Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,°                  °452"
1467,AN EPISODE,The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd
1468,AN EPISODE,"His stately crest,° and dimm'd his glittering arms.                 °454"
1469,AN EPISODE,"His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice              455"
1470,AN EPISODE,Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:--
1471,AN EPISODE,
1472,AN EPISODE,"""Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!"
1473,AN EPISODE,"Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!"
1474,AN EPISODE,"Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!"
1475,AN EPISODE,Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now                               460
1476,AN EPISODE,"With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;"
1477,AN EPISODE,"But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance"
1478,AN EPISODE,"Of battle, and with me, who make no play"
1479,AN EPISODE,"Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand."
1480,AN EPISODE,"Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!                      465"
1481,AN EPISODE,Remember all thy valour°; try thy feints                            °466
1482,AN EPISODE,And cunning! all the pity I had is gone;
1483,AN EPISODE,Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts
1484,AN EPISODE,"With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles.°""             °468"
1485,AN EPISODE,
1486,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and Sohrab kindled° at his taunts,                        °470"
1487,AN EPISODE,And he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd
1488,AN EPISODE,"Together, as two eagles on one prey"
1489,AN EPISODE,"Come rushing down together from the clouds,"
1490,AN EPISODE,"One from the east, one from the west; their shields"
1491,AN EPISODE,"Bash'd with a clang together, and a din                             475"
1492,AN EPISODE,"Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters"
1493,AN EPISODE,"Make often in the forest's heart at morn,"
1494,AN EPISODE,"Of hewing axes, crashing trees--such blows"
1495,AN EPISODE,Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.
1496,AN EPISODE,And you would say that sun and stars took part                       480
1497,AN EPISODE,In that unnatural° conflict; for a cloud°                           °481
1498,AN EPISODE,"Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun"
1499,AN EPISODE,Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose
1500,AN EPISODE,"Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,"
1501,AN EPISODE,And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.                           485
1502,AN EPISODE,"In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;"
1503,AN EPISODE,For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
1504,AN EPISODE,"Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,"
1505,AN EPISODE,And the sun sparkled° on the Oxus stream.                           °489
1506,AN EPISODE,"But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes                    490"
1507,AN EPISODE,And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield
1508,AN EPISODE,Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear
1509,AN EPISODE,"Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,"
1510,AN EPISODE,And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.
1511,AN EPISODE,"Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,°                    °495"
1512,AN EPISODE,Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest
1513,AN EPISODE,"He shore° away, and that proud horsehair plume,                     °497"
1514,AN EPISODE,"Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;"
1515,AN EPISODE,And Rustum bow'd his head°; but then the gloom                      °499
1516,AN EPISODE,"Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,                            500"
1517,AN EPISODE,"And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,"
1518,AN EPISODE,"Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;--"
1519,AN EPISODE,"No horse's cry was that, most like the roar"
1520,AN EPISODE,"Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day"
1521,AN EPISODE,"Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,                       505"
1522,AN EPISODE,And comes at night to die upon the sand.
1523,AN EPISODE,"The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,"
1524,AN EPISODE,And Oxus curdled° as it cross'd his stream.                         °508
1525,AN EPISODE,"But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,"
1526,AN EPISODE,And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd                             510
1527,AN EPISODE,"His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,"
1528,AN EPISODE,"Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,"
1529,AN EPISODE,And in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.
1530,AN EPISODE,Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes
1531,AN EPISODE,"Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,                     515"
1532,AN EPISODE,"And shouted: _Rustum_°!--Sohrab heard that shout,                   °516"
1533,AN EPISODE,"And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,"
1534,AN EPISODE,And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form;
1535,AN EPISODE,And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd
1536,AN EPISODE,"His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.                 520"
1537,AN EPISODE,"He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;"
1538,AN EPISODE,"And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,"
1539,AN EPISODE,"And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all"
1540,AN EPISODE,The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair--
1541,AN EPISODE,"Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,                             525"
1542,AN EPISODE,"And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand."
1543,AN EPISODE,
1544,AN EPISODE,"Then, with a bitter smile,° Rustum began:--                         °527"
1545,AN EPISODE,"""Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill"
1546,AN EPISODE,"A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,"
1547,AN EPISODE,And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.                            530
1548,AN EPISODE,Or else that the great Rustum would come down
1549,AN EPISODE,"Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move"
1550,AN EPISODE,"His heart to take a gift, and let thee go."
1551,AN EPISODE,And then that all the Tartar host would praise
1552,AN EPISODE,"Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,                       535"
1553,AN EPISODE,To glad° thy father in his weak old age.                            °536
1554,AN EPISODE,"Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!"
1555,AN EPISODE,Dearer to the red jackals° shalt thou be                            °538

1558,AN EPISODE,"And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:--                         540"
1559,AN EPISODE,"""Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain"
1560,AN EPISODE,"Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!"
1561,AN EPISODE,"No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart."
1562,AN EPISODE,"For were I match'd with ten such men as thee,"
1563,AN EPISODE,"And I were that which till to-day I was,                             545"
1564,AN EPISODE,"They should be lying here, I standing there"
1565,AN EPISODE,But that belovéd name unnerved my arm--
1566,AN EPISODE,"That name, and something, I confess, in thee,"
1567,AN EPISODE,"Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield"
1568,AN EPISODE,Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.                       550
1569,AN EPISODE,"And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate."
1570,AN EPISODE,"But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear"
1571,AN EPISODE,The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!
1572,AN EPISODE,"My father, whom I seek through all the world,"
1573,AN EPISODE,"He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!""                          555"
1574,AN EPISODE,
1575,AN EPISODE,As when some hunter° in the spring hath found                       °556
1576,AN EPISODE,"A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,"
1577,AN EPISODE,"Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,"
1578,AN EPISODE,"And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,"
1579,AN EPISODE,And follow'd her to find her where she fell                          560
1580,AN EPISODE,Far off;--anon her mate comes winging back
1581,AN EPISODE,"From hunting, and a great way off descries"
1582,AN EPISODE,"His huddling young left sole°; at that, he checks                   °563"
1583,AN EPISODE,"His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps"
1584,AN EPISODE,"Circles above his eyry, with loud screams                            565"
1585,AN EPISODE,Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she
1586,AN EPISODE,"Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,"
1587,AN EPISODE,"In some far stony gorge out of his ken,"
1588,AN EPISODE,A heap of fluttering feathers--never more
1589,AN EPISODE,"Shall the lake glass° her, flying over it;                          °570"
1590,AN EPISODE,Never the black and dripping precipices
1591,AN EPISODE,Echo her stormy scream as she sails by--
1592,AN EPISODE,"As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,"
1593,AN EPISODE,"So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood"
1594,AN EPISODE,"Over his dying son, and knew him not.                                575"
1595,AN EPISODE,
1596,AN EPISODE,"But, with a cold incredulous voice, he said:--"
1597,AN EPISODE,"""What prate is this of fathers and revenge?"
1598,AN EPISODE,"The mighty Rustum never had a son."""
1599,AN EPISODE,
1600,AN EPISODE,"And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:--"
1601,AN EPISODE,"""Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.                             580"
1602,AN EPISODE,"Surely the news will one day reach his ear,"
1603,AN EPISODE,"Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,"
1604,AN EPISODE,"Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;"
1605,AN EPISODE,"And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap"
1606,AN EPISODE,"To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.                            585"
1607,AN EPISODE,"Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!"
1608,AN EPISODE,"What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?"
1609,AN EPISODE,"Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!"
1610,AN EPISODE,"Yet him I pity not so much, but her,"
1611,AN EPISODE,"My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells                                 590"
1612,AN EPISODE,"With that old king, her father, who grows grey"
1613,AN EPISODE,"With age, and rules over the valiant Koords."
1614,AN EPISODE,"Her most I pity, who no more will see"
1615,AN EPISODE,"Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,"
1616,AN EPISODE,"With spoils and honour, when the war is done.                        595"
1617,AN EPISODE,"But a dark rumour will be bruited up,°                              °596"
1618,AN EPISODE,"From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;"
1619,AN EPISODE,And then will that defenceless woman learn
1620,AN EPISODE,"That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,"
1621,AN EPISODE,"But that in battle with a nameless foe,                              600"
1622,AN EPISODE,"By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain."""
1623,AN EPISODE,
1624,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,"
1625,AN EPISODE,"Thinking of her he left, and his own death."
1626,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought."
1627,AN EPISODE,Nor did he yet believe it was his son                                605
1628,AN EPISODE,"Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;"
1629,AN EPISODE,"For he had had sure tidings that the babe,"
1630,AN EPISODE,"Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,"
1631,AN EPISODE,"Had been a puny girl, no boy at all--"
1632,AN EPISODE,"So that sad mother sent him word, for fear                           610"
1633,AN EPISODE,"Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms--"
1634,AN EPISODE,"And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,"
1635,AN EPISODE,"By a false boast, the style° of Rustum's son;                       °613"
1636,AN EPISODE,"Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame."
1637,AN EPISODE,"So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought                    615"
1638,AN EPISODE,"And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide"
1639,AN EPISODE,Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore
1640,AN EPISODE,At the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;
1641,AN EPISODE,"For he remember'd his own early youth,"
1642,AN EPISODE,"And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,                           620"
1643,AN EPISODE,The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
1644,AN EPISODE,"A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,"
1645,AN EPISODE,Through many rolling clouds--so Rustum saw
1646,AN EPISODE,"His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;"
1647,AN EPISODE,"And that old king,° her father, who loved well                      °625"
1648,AN EPISODE,"His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child"
1649,AN EPISODE,"With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,"
1650,AN EPISODE,"They three, in that long-distant summer-time--"
1651,AN EPISODE,"The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt"
1652,AN EPISODE,"And hound, and morn on those delightful hills                        630"
1653,AN EPISODE,"In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,"
1654,AN EPISODE,"Of age and looks° to be his own dear son,                           °632"
1655,AN EPISODE,"Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand;"
1656,AN EPISODE,Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe
1657,AN EPISODE,"Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,                               635"
1658,AN EPISODE,"Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,"
1659,AN EPISODE,"And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,"
1660,AN EPISODE,"On the mown, dying grass--so Sohrab lay,"
1661,AN EPISODE,"Lovely in death, upon the common sand."
1662,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:--                      640"
1663,AN EPISODE,
1664,AN EPISODE,"""O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son"
1665,AN EPISODE,"Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved."
1666,AN EPISODE,"Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men"
1667,AN EPISODE,Have told thee false--thou art not Rustum's son.
1668,AN EPISODE,For Rustum had no son; one child he had--                            645
1669,AN EPISODE,But one--a girl; who with her mother now
1670,AN EPISODE,"Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us--"
1671,AN EPISODE,"Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war."""
1672,AN EPISODE,
1673,AN EPISODE,But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath; for now
1674,AN EPISODE,"The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,                     650"
1675,AN EPISODE,"And he desired to draw forth the steel,"
1676,AN EPISODE,"And let the blood flow free, and so to die--"
1677,AN EPISODE,But first he would convince his stubborn foe;
1678,AN EPISODE,"And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:--"
1679,AN EPISODE,
1680,AN EPISODE,"""Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?                           655"
1681,AN EPISODE,"Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,"
1682,AN EPISODE,"And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine."
1683,AN EPISODE,"I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm° I bear                          °658"
1684,AN EPISODE,"That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,"
1685,AN EPISODE,"That she might prick it on the babe she bore.""                       660"
1686,AN EPISODE,
1687,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,"
1688,AN EPISODE,"And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand"
1689,AN EPISODE,"Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,"
1690,AN EPISODE,That the hard iron corslet° clank'd aloud;                          °663
1691,AN EPISODE,"And to his heart he press'd the other hand,                          665"
1692,AN EPISODE,"And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:--"
1693,AN EPISODE,
1694,AN EPISODE,"""Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!"
1695,AN EPISODE,"If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son."""
1696,AN EPISODE,
1697,AN EPISODE,"Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed"
1698,AN EPISODE,"His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,                       670"
1699,AN EPISODE,And show'd a sign in faint vermilion points
1700,AN EPISODE,"Prick'd; as a cunning° workman, in Pekin,                           °672"
1701,AN EPISODE,"Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,"
1702,AN EPISODE,"An emperor's gift--at early morn he paints,"
1703,AN EPISODE,"And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp                    675"
1704,AN EPISODE,Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands--
1705,AN EPISODE,So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd
1706,AN EPISODE,"On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal."
1707,AN EPISODE,"It was that griffin,° which of old rear'd Zal,                      °679"
1708,AN EPISODE,"Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,                        680"
1709,AN EPISODE,"A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;"
1710,AN EPISODE,"Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved--"
1711,AN EPISODE,Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.
1712,AN EPISODE,"And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,"
1713,AN EPISODE,"And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,                      685"
1714,AN EPISODE,And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:--
1715,AN EPISODE,
1716,AN EPISODE,"""How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign"
1717,AN EPISODE,"Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?"""
1718,AN EPISODE,
1719,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood"
1720,AN EPISODE,Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:                       690
1721,AN EPISODE,_O boy_--_thy father!_--and his voice choked there.
1722,AN EPISODE,"And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,"
1723,AN EPISODE,"And his head swam, and he sank down to earth."
1724,AN EPISODE,"But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast"
1725,AN EPISODE,"His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,                        695"
1726,AN EPISODE,"And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,"
1727,AN EPISODE,Trying to call him back to life; and life
1728,AN EPISODE,"Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,"
1729,AN EPISODE,And they stood wide with horror; and he seized
1730,AN EPISODE,"In both his hands the dust which lay around,                         700"
1731,AN EPISODE,"And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,--"
1732,AN EPISODE,"His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;"
1733,AN EPISODE,"And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,"
1734,AN EPISODE,"And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,"
1735,AN EPISODE,"To draw it, and for ever let life out.                               705"
1736,AN EPISODE,"But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,"
1737,AN EPISODE,"And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:--"
1738,AN EPISODE,
1739,AN EPISODE,"""Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day"
1740,AN EPISODE,The doom which at my birth was written down
1741,AN EPISODE,"In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.°                 °710"
1742,AN EPISODE,"Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,"
1743,AN EPISODE,"When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,"
1744,AN EPISODE,I know it! but fate trod those promptings down
1745,AN EPISODE,"Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged"
1746,AN EPISODE,"The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear.                      715"
1747,AN EPISODE,But let us speak no more of this! I find
1748,AN EPISODE,My father; let me feel that I have found!°                          °717
1749,AN EPISODE,"Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take"
1750,AN EPISODE,"My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,"
1751,AN EPISODE,"And wash them with thy tears, and say: _My son!_                     720"
1752,AN EPISODE,"Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,"
1753,AN EPISODE,And swift; for like the lightning to this field
1754,AN EPISODE,"I came, and like the wind I go away--"
1755,AN EPISODE,"Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.°                        °724"
1756,AN EPISODE,"But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.""                      725"
1757,AN EPISODE,
1758,AN EPISODE,"So said he, and his voice released the heart"
1759,AN EPISODE,"Of Rustum, and his tears brake forth; he cast"
1760,AN EPISODE,"His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,"
1761,AN EPISODE,"And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,"
1762,AN EPISODE,"When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,                  730"
1763,AN EPISODE,With his head bowing to the ground and mane
1764,AN EPISODE,"Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe"
1765,AN EPISODE,First to the one then to the other moved
1766,AN EPISODE,"His head, as if inquiring what their grief"
1767,AN EPISODE,"Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,                   735"
1768,AN EPISODE,"The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked° the sand.                °736"
1769,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:--"
1770,AN EPISODE,
1771,AN EPISODE,"""Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet"
1772,AN EPISODE,"Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,"
1773,AN EPISODE,"Or ere they brought thy master to this field!""                       740"
1774,AN EPISODE,
1775,AN EPISODE,But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said:--
1776,AN EPISODE,"""Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,"
1777,AN EPISODE,"My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,"
1778,AN EPISODE,"My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,"
1779,AN EPISODE,That I should one day find thy lord and thee.                        745
1780,AN EPISODE,"Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!"
1781,AN EPISODE,"O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;"
1782,AN EPISODE,"For thou hast gone where I shall never go,"
1783,AN EPISODE,And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.
1784,AN EPISODE,"And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,                             750"
1785,AN EPISODE,"And seen the River of Helmund,° and the Lake                        °751"
1786,AN EPISODE,Of Zirrah°; and the aged Zal himself                                °752
1787,AN EPISODE,"Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,"
1788,AN EPISODE,"Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,"
1789,AN EPISODE,And said: _O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!_--but I                        755
1790,AN EPISODE,"Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,"
1791,AN EPISODE,"Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,"
1792,AN EPISODE,Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;
1793,AN EPISODE,"But lodged among my father's foes, and seen"
1794,AN EPISODE,"Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,                                   760"
1795,AN EPISODE,"Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,"
1796,AN EPISODE,And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk
1797,AN EPISODE,"The desert rivers, Moorghab° and Tejend,°                           °763"
1798,AN EPISODE,"Kohik,° and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,"
1799,AN EPISODE,"The northern Sir°; and this great Oxus stream,                      °765"
1800,AN EPISODE,"The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die."""
1801,AN EPISODE,
1802,AN EPISODE,"Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:--"
1803,AN EPISODE,"""Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!"
1804,AN EPISODE,"Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt"
1805,AN EPISODE,"Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!""                          770"
1806,AN EPISODE,
1807,AN EPISODE,"But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:--"
1808,AN EPISODE,"""Desire not that, my father! thou must live."
1809,AN EPISODE,"For some are born to do great deeds, and live,"
1810,AN EPISODE,"As some are born to be obscured, and die."
1811,AN EPISODE,"Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,                             775"
1812,AN EPISODE,And reap a second glory in thine age;
1813,AN EPISODE,"Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine."
1814,AN EPISODE,But come! thou seest this great host of men
1815,AN EPISODE,"Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!"
1816,AN EPISODE,Let me entreat for them; what have they done?                        780
1817,AN EPISODE,"They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star."
1818,AN EPISODE,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.
1819,AN EPISODE,"But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,"
1820,AN EPISODE,"But carry me with thee to Seistan,"
1821,AN EPISODE,"And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,                             785"
1822,AN EPISODE,"Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends."
1823,AN EPISODE,"And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,"
1824,AN EPISODE,"And heap a stately mound° above my bones,                           °788"
1825,AN EPISODE,And plant a far-seen pillar over all.
1826,AN EPISODE,That so the passing horseman on the waste                            790
1827,AN EPISODE,"May see my tomb a great way off, and cry:"
1828,AN EPISODE,"_Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,"

1830,AN EPISODE,"And I be not forgotten in my grave."""
1831,AN EPISODE,
1832,AN EPISODE,"And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:--                        795"
1833,AN EPISODE,"""Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,"
1834,AN EPISODE,"So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,"
1835,AN EPISODE,"And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,"
1836,AN EPISODE,"And carry thee away to Seistan,"

1844,AN EPISODE,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!
1845,AN EPISODE,What should I do with slaying any more?
1846,AN EPISODE,For would that all that I have ever slain
1847,AN EPISODE,"Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes,                         810"
1848,AN EPISODE,"And they who were call'd champions in their time,"

1850,AN EPISODE,"And I were nothing but a common man,"

1852,AN EPISODE,"So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!                           815"
1853,AN EPISODE,"Or rather would that I, even I myself,"

1863,AN EPISODE,"And I shall never end this life of blood."""
1864,AN EPISODE,
1865,AN EPISODE,"Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:--"

1876,AN EPISODE,"Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure."""
1877,AN EPISODE,
1878,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took"
1879,AN EPISODE,"The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased"
1880,AN EPISODE,His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood                         840
1881,AN EPISODE,"Came welling from the open gash, and life"
1882,AN EPISODE,Flow'd with the stream;--all down his cold white side
1883,AN EPISODE,"The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,"
1884,AN EPISODE,Like the soil'd tissue of white violets
1885,AN EPISODE,"Left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,                        845"
1886,AN EPISODE,By children whom their nurses call with haste
1887,AN EPISODE,"Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,"
1888,AN EPISODE,"His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay--"
1889,AN EPISODE,"White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,"
1890,AN EPISODE,"Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,                    850"
1891,AN EPISODE,"Convulsed him back to life, he open'd them,"
1892,AN EPISODE,And fix'd them feebly on his father's face;
1893,AN EPISODE,"Till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs"
1894,AN EPISODE,"Unwillingly the spirit fled away,"
1895,AN EPISODE,"Regretting the warm mansion which it left,                           855"
1896,AN EPISODE,"And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world."
1897,AN EPISODE,
1898,AN EPISODE,"So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;"
1899,AN EPISODE,And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak
1900,AN EPISODE,"Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son."
1901,AN EPISODE,"As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd                     860"

1905,AN EPISODE,So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.

1908,AN EPISODE,"And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,"
1909,AN EPISODE,"And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,"
1910,AN EPISODE,"Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,"
1911,AN EPISODE,"As of a great assembly loosed, and fires"
1912,AN EPISODE,Began to twinkle through the fog; for now                            870
1913,AN EPISODE,"Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;"
1914,AN EPISODE,The Persians took it on the open sands
1915,AN EPISODE,"Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;"
1916,AN EPISODE,And Rustum and his son were left alone.
1917,AN EPISODE,
1918,AN EPISODE,"But the majestic river floated on,                                   875"
1919,AN EPISODE,"Out of the mist and hum of that low land,"
1920,AN EPISODE,"Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,"
1921,AN EPISODE,"Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian° waste,                    °878"

1927,AN EPISODE,The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along
1928,AN EPISODE,Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles--                        885
1929,AN EPISODE,"Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had"
1930,AN EPISODE,"In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,"

2121,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.
2122,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,"
2123,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.             75
2124,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:
2125,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"""Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!"
2126,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"Dear heart,"" I said, ""we are long alone;"
2127,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan."""
2128,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"But, ah, she gave me never a look,                                    80"
2129,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,For her eyes were seal'd° to the holy book!                          °81
2130,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.

2135,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,Down to the depths of the sea!
2136,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"She sits at her wheel in the humming town,"
2137,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,Singing most joyfully.

2139,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"For the humming street, and the child with its toy!                   90"
2140,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;"

2145,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"Till the spindle drops from her hand,"
2146,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,And the whizzing wheel stands still.
2147,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,"
2148,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,And over the sand at the sea;
2149,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,And her eyes are set in a stare;                                     100
2150,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"And anon there breaks a sigh,"

2154,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"A long, long sigh;                                                   105"
2155,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden
2156,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,And the gleam of her golden hair.

2158,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"Come away, away, children;"

2161,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,Lights shine in the town.
2162,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,She will start from her slumber
2163,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,When gusts shake the door;

2165,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,Will hear the waves roar.                                            115
2166,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"We shall see, while above us"
2167,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"The waves roar and whirl,"
2168,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN°,"A ceiling of amber,"

2396,TRISTRAM,"Faster surely than it should,"
2397,TRISTRAM,From the fever in his blood!
2398,TRISTRAM,All the spring-time of his love
2399,TRISTRAM,"Is already gone and past,"
2400,TRISTRAM,And instead thereof is seen                                          175

2411,TRISTRAM,The love-desperate banish'd knight
2412,TRISTRAM,With a fire in his brain
2413,TRISTRAM,Flying o'er the stormy main.
2414,TRISTRAM,--Whither does he wander now?
2415,TRISTRAM,Haply in his dreams the wind                                         190

2422,TRISTRAM,Iseult of Brittany.

2431,TRISTRAM,Haply he seems again to move
2432,TRISTRAM,His young guardian's heart with love
2433,TRISTRAM,"In his exiled loneliness,"
2434,TRISTRAM,"In his stately, deep distress,"
2435,TRISTRAM,"Without a word, without a tear.                                      210"
2436,TRISTRAM,--Ah! 'tis well he should retrace
2437,TRISTRAM,His tranquil life in this lone place;
2438,TRISTRAM,His gentle bearing at the side
2439,TRISTRAM,Of his timid youthful bride;
2440,TRISTRAM,His long rambles by the shore                                        215
2441,TRISTRAM,"On winter-evenings, when the roar"
2442,TRISTRAM,"Of the near waves came, sadly grand,"
2443,TRISTRAM,"Through the dark, up the drown'd sand,"
2444,TRISTRAM,Or his endless reveries
2445,TRISTRAM,"In the woods, where the gleams play                                  220"
2446,TRISTRAM,"On the grass under the trees,"
2447,TRISTRAM,Passing the long summer's day
2448,TRISTRAM,Idle as a mossy stone
2449,TRISTRAM,"In the forest-depths alone,"
2450,TRISTRAM,"The chase neglected, and his hound                                   225"

2453,TRISTRAM,Hither let him wander now;
2454,TRISTRAM,"Hither, to the quiet hours"
2455,TRISTRAM,Pass'd among these heaths of ours.                                   230
2456,TRISTRAM,By the grey Atlantic sea;
2457,TRISTRAM,"Hours, if not of ecstasy,"
2458,TRISTRAM,From violent anguish surely free!
2459,TRISTRAM,
2460,TRISTRAM,"_Tristram_. All red with blood the whirling river flows,"
2461,TRISTRAM,"The wide plain rings, the dazed air throbs with blows.               235"
2462,TRISTRAM,Upon us are the chivalry of Rome--

2467,TRISTRAM,I see her form glide through the crossing spears.--

2473,TRISTRAM,"We cannot keep him; now, as then,"
2474,TRISTRAM,There's a secret in his breast°                                     °245
2475,TRISTRAM,Which will never let him rest.
2476,TRISTRAM,These musing fits in the green wood
2477,TRISTRAM,"They cloud the brain, they dull the blood!"
2478,TRISTRAM,"--His sword is sharp, his horse is good;"
2479,TRISTRAM,Beyond the mountains will he see                                     250
2480,TRISTRAM,"The famous towns of Italy,"
2481,TRISTRAM,And label with the blessed sign°                                    °252
2482,TRISTRAM,The heathen Saxons on the Rhine.

2485,TRISTRAM,There's many a gay knight where he goes
2486,TRISTRAM,Will help him to forget his care;
2487,TRISTRAM,"The march, the leaguer,° Heaven's blithe air,                       °258"
2488,TRISTRAM,"The neighing steeds, the ringing blows--"
2489,TRISTRAM,Sick pining comes not where these are.                               260
2490,TRISTRAM,"Ah! what boots it,° that the jest                                   °261"
2491,TRISTRAM,"Lightens every other brow,"
2492,TRISTRAM,"What, that every other breast"
2493,TRISTRAM,"Dances as the trumpets blow,"
2494,TRISTRAM,If one's own heart beats not light                                   265
2495,TRISTRAM,"On the waves of the toss'd fight,"
2496,TRISTRAM,If oneself cannot get free
2497,TRISTRAM,From the clog of misery?
2498,TRISTRAM,Thy lovely youthful wife grows pale
2499,TRISTRAM,Watching by the salt sea-tide                                        270
2500,TRISTRAM,With her children at her side
2501,TRISTRAM,For the gleam of thy white sail.
2502,TRISTRAM,"Home, Tristram, to thy halls again!"
2503,TRISTRAM,"To our lonely sea complain,"
2504,TRISTRAM,To our forests tell thy pain!                                        275
2505,TRISTRAM,
2506,TRISTRAM,"_Tristram_. All round the forest sweeps off, black in shade,"
2507,TRISTRAM,But it is moonlight in the open glade;
2508,TRISTRAM,And in the bottom of the glade shine clear
2509,TRISTRAM,The forest-chapel and the fountain near.
2510,TRISTRAM,"--I think, I have a fever in my blood;                               280"
2511,TRISTRAM,"Come, let me leave the shadow of this wood,"
2512,TRISTRAM,"Ride down, and bathe my hot brow in the flood."
2513,TRISTRAM,--Mild shines the cold spring in the moon's clear light;
2514,TRISTRAM,God! 'tis _her_ face plays in the waters bright.
2515,TRISTRAM,"""Fair love,"" she says, ""canst thou forget so soon,                   285"

2517,TRISTRAM,Iseult!...

2520,TRISTRAM,
2521,TRISTRAM,"Ah, poor soul! if this be so,"
2522,TRISTRAM,Only death can balm thy woe.
2523,TRISTRAM,The solitudes of the green wood                                  290
2524,TRISTRAM,Had no medicine for thy mood;
2525,TRISTRAM,The rushing battle clear'd thy blood
2526,TRISTRAM,As little as did solitude.
2527,TRISTRAM,--Ah! his eyelids slowly break
2528,TRISTRAM,"Their hot seals, and let him wake;                               295"
2529,TRISTRAM,What new change shall we now see?
2530,TRISTRAM,A happier? Worse it cannot be.
2531,TRISTRAM,
2532,TRISTRAM,"_Tristram_. Is my page here? Come, turn me to the fire!"
2533,TRISTRAM,Upon the window-panes the moon shines bright;
2534,TRISTRAM,The wind is down--but she'll not come to-night.                      300
2535,TRISTRAM,"Ah no! she is asleep in Cornwall now,"
2536,TRISTRAM,Far hence; her dreams are fair--smooth is her brow
2537,TRISTRAM,"Of me she recks not,° nor my vain desire.                           °303"
2538,TRISTRAM,
2539,TRISTRAM,"--I have had dreams, I have had dreams, my page,"
2540,TRISTRAM,Would take a score years from a strong man's age;                    305
2541,TRISTRAM,"And with a blood like mine, will leave, I fear,"
2542,TRISTRAM,Scant leisure for a second messenger.
2543,TRISTRAM,
2544,TRISTRAM,"--My princess, art thou there? Sweet, do not wait!"
2545,TRISTRAM,"To bed, and sleep! my fever is gone by;"
2546,TRISTRAM,To-night my page shall keep me company.                              310
2547,TRISTRAM,Where do the children sleep? kiss them for me!
2548,TRISTRAM,"Poor child, thou art almost as pale as I;"
2549,TRISTRAM,This comes of nursing long and watching late.
2550,TRISTRAM,To bed--good night!°                                                °314
2551,TRISTRAM,
2552,TRISTRAM,*       *       *       *       *
2553,TRISTRAM,
2554,TRISTRAM,"She left the gleam-lit fireplace,                                    315"
2555,TRISTRAM,She came to the bed-side;
2556,TRISTRAM,She took his hands in hers--her tears
2557,TRISTRAM,Down on his wasted fingers rain'd.
2558,TRISTRAM,She raised her eyes upon his face--
2559,TRISTRAM,"Not with a look of wounded pride,                                    320"
2560,TRISTRAM,A look as if the heart complained--
2561,TRISTRAM,Her look was like a sad embrace;
2562,TRISTRAM,The gaze of one who can divine
2563,TRISTRAM,"A grief, and sympathise."
2564,TRISTRAM,Sweet flower! thy children's eyes                                    325
2565,TRISTRAM,Are not more innocent than thine.
2566,TRISTRAM,"But they sleep in shelter'd rest,"
2567,TRISTRAM,"Like helpless birds in the warm nest,"
2568,TRISTRAM,On the castle's southern side;
2569,TRISTRAM,Where feebly comes the mournful roar                                 330
2570,TRISTRAM,Of buffeting wind and surging tide
2571,TRISTRAM,Through many a room and corridor.
2572,TRISTRAM,--Full on their window the moon's ray
2573,TRISTRAM,Makes their chamber as bright as day.
2574,TRISTRAM,"It shines upon the blank white walls,                                335"
2575,TRISTRAM,"And on the snowy pillow falls,"
2576,TRISTRAM,And on two angel-heads doth play
2577,TRISTRAM,"Turn'd to each other--the eyes closed,"
2578,TRISTRAM,The lashes on the cheeks reposed.
2579,TRISTRAM,Round each sweet brow the cap close-set                              340
2580,TRISTRAM,Hardly lets peep the golden hair;
2581,TRISTRAM,Through the soft-open'd lips the air
2582,TRISTRAM,Scarcely moves the coverlet.
2583,TRISTRAM,One little wandering arm is thrown
2584,TRISTRAM,"At random on the counterpane,                                        345"
2585,TRISTRAM,And often the fingers close in haste
2586,TRISTRAM,As if their baby-owner chased
2587,TRISTRAM,The butterflies again.
2588,TRISTRAM,"This stir they have, and this alone;                                 350"
2589,TRISTRAM,But else they are so still!
2590,TRISTRAM,"--Ah, tired madcaps! you lie still;"
2591,TRISTRAM,"But were you at the window now,"
2592,TRISTRAM,To look forth on the fairy sight
2593,TRISTRAM,"Of your illumined haunts by night,                                   355"
2594,TRISTRAM,To see the park-glades where you play
2595,TRISTRAM,"Far lovelier than they are by day,"
2596,TRISTRAM,"To see the sparkle on the eaves,"
2597,TRISTRAM,And upon every giant-bough
2598,TRISTRAM,"Of those old oaks, whose wet red leaves                              360"
2599,TRISTRAM,Are jewell'd with bright drops of rain--
2600,TRISTRAM,How would your voices run again!
2601,TRISTRAM,And far beyond the sparkling trees
2602,TRISTRAM,Of the castle-park one sees
2603,TRISTRAM,"The bare heaths spreading, clear as day,                             365"
2604,TRISTRAM,"Moor behind moor, far, far away,"
2605,TRISTRAM,Into the heart of Brittany.
2606,TRISTRAM,"And here and there, lock'd by the land,"
2607,TRISTRAM,"Long inlets of smooth glittering sea,"
2608,TRISTRAM,And many a stretch of watery sand                                    370
2609,TRISTRAM,All shining in the white moon-beams--
2610,TRISTRAM,But you see fairer in your dreams!
2611,TRISTRAM,
2612,TRISTRAM,What voices are these on the clear night-air?
2613,TRISTRAM,What lights in the court--what steps on the stair?

2631,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2632,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Tristram_. Thou art come, indeed--thou hast rejoin'd me;"
2633,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Thou hast dared it--but too late to save.                           10
2634,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Fear not now that men should tax thine honour!
2635,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,I am dying: build--(thou may'st)--my grave!

2637,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Iseult_. Tristram, ah, for love of Heaven, speak kindly!"
2638,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"What, I hear these bitter words from thee?"
2639,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Sick with grief I am, and faint with travel--                         15"
2640,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Take my hand--dear Tristram, look on me!"
2641,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2642,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Tristram_. I forgot, thou comest from thy voyage--"
2643,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Yes, the spray is on thy cloak and hair."
2644,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"But thy dark eyes are not dimm'd, proud Iseult!"
2645,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And thy beauty never was more fair.                                 20
2646,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2647,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Iseult_. Ah, harsh flatterer! let alone my beauty!"
2648,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"I, like thee, have left my youth afar."
2649,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Take my hand, and touch these wasted fingers--"
2650,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"See my cheek and lips, how white they are!"
2651,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2652,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Tristram_. Thou art paler--but thy sweet charm, Iseult!              25"
2653,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Would not fade with the dull years away.

2659,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Sing thee tales of true, long-parted lovers,"
2660,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Join'd at evening of their days again.
2661,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2662,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Tristram_. No, thou shalt not speak! I should be finding"
2663,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Something alter'd in thy courtly tone.

2665,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"In the green wood, all our lives, alone."
2666,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2667,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Iseult_. Alter'd, Tristram? Not in courts, believe me,"
2668,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Love like mine is alter'd in the breast;
2669,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Courtly life is light and cannot reach it--
2670,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Ah! it lives, because so deep-suppress'd!                           40"
2671,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,

2675,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Circled, Tristram, by a band of gold?"
2676,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2677,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Royal state with Marc, my deep-wrong'd husband--                      45"
2678,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,That was bliss to make my sorrows flee!
2679,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Silken courtiers whispering honied nothings°--
2680,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Those were friends to make me false to thee!
2681,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2682,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Ah, on which, if both our lots were balanced,"
2683,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Was indeed the heaviest burden thrown--                             50
2684,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Thee, a pining exile in thy forest,"
2685,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Me, a smiling queen upon my throne?"
2686,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2687,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Vain and strange debate, where both have suffer'd,"
2688,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Both have pass'd a youth consumed and sad,"
2689,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Both have brought their anxious day to evening,                       55"
2690,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And have now short space for being glad!
2691,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2692,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Join'd we are henceforth; nor will thy people,"
2693,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Nor thy younger Iseult take it ill,"
2694,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"That a former rival shares her office,"
2695,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"When she sees her humbled, pale, and still.                         60"
2696,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2697,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"I, a faded watcher by thy pillow,"
2698,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"I, a statue on thy chapel-floor,"
2699,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Pour'd in prayer before the Virgin-Mother,"
2700,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Rouse no anger, make no rivals more."
2701,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2702,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"She will cry: ""Is this the foe I dreaded?                             65"
2703,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,This his idol? this that royal bride?
2704,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Ah, an hour of health would purge his eyesight!"
2705,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Stay, pale queen! for ever by my side."""
2706,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2707,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Hush, no words! that smile, I see, forgives me."
2708,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"I am now thy nurse, I bid thee sleep.                               70"
2709,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Close thine eyes--this flooding moonlight blinds them!--
2710,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Nay, all's well again! thou must not weep."
2711,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2712,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Tristram_. I am happy! yet I feel, there's something"
2713,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Swells my heart, and takes my breath away."
2714,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Through a mist I see thee; near--come nearer!                         75
2715,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Bend--bend down!--I yet have much to say.
2716,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2717,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,_Iseult_. Heaven! his head sinks back upon the pillow--
2718,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Tristram! Tristram! let thy heart not fail!
2719,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Call on God and on the holy angels!
2720,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"What, love, courage!--Christ! he is so pale.                        80"
2721,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2722,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_Tristram_. Hush, 'tis vain, I feel my end approaching!"
2723,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"This is what my mother said should be,"
2724,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"When the fierce pains took her in the forest,"
2725,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"The deep draughts of death, in bearing me."
2726,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2727,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"""Son,"" she said, ""thy name shall be of sorrow;                        85"
2728,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Tristram art thou call'd for my death's sake."""
2729,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"So she said, and died in the drear forest."
2730,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Grief since then his home with me doth make.°                      °88
2731,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2732,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"I am dying.--Start not, nor look wildly!"
2733,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Me, thy living friend, thou canst not save.                         90"
2734,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"But, since living we were ununited,"
2735,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Go not far, O Iseult! from my grave."
2736,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2737,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Close mine eyes, then seek the princess Iseult;"
2738,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Speak her fair, she is of royal blood!"
2739,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Say, I will'd so, that thou stay beside me--                          95"
2740,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,She will grant it; she is kind and good.
2741,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2742,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Now to sail the seas of death I leave thee--
2743,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,One last kiss upon the living shore!
2744,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2745,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,_Iseult_. Tristram!--Tristram!--stay--receive me with thee!
2746,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Iseult leaves thee, Tristram! never more.°                        °100"
2747,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2748,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,*       *       *       *       *
2749,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2750,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,You see them clear--the moon shines bright.
2751,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Slow, slow and softly, where she stood,"
2752,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,She sinks upon the ground;--her hood
2753,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Has fallen back; her arms outspread
2754,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Still hold her lover's hand; her head                                105
2755,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Is bow'd, half-buried, on the bed."
2756,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,O'er the blanch'd sheet her raven hair
2757,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Lies in disorder'd streams; and there,"
2758,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Strung like white stars, the pearls still are,"
2759,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"And the golden bracelets, heavy and rare,                            110"
2760,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Flash on her white arms still.
2761,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,The very same which yesternight
2762,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Flash'd in the silver sconces'° light,                              °113"
2763,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,When the feast was gay and the laughter loud
2764,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,In Tyntagel's palace proud.                                          115
2765,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,But then they deck'd a restless ghost
2766,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"With hot-flush'd cheeks and brilliant eyes,"
2767,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And quivering lips on which the tide
2768,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Of courtly speech abruptly died,"
2769,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"And a glance which over the crowded floor,                           120"
2770,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"The dancers, and the festive host,"
2771,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Flew ever to the door.°                                             °122
2772,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"That the knights eyed her in surprise,"
2773,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And the dames whispered scoffingly:
2774,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"""Her moods, good lack, they pass like showers!                       125"
2775,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,But yesternight and she would be
2776,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"As pale and still as wither'd flowers,"
2777,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And now to-night she laughs and speaks
2778,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And has a colour in her cheeks;
2779,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Christ keep us from such fantasy!""--                                 130"
2780,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Yes, now the longing is o'erpast,"
2781,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Which, dogg'd° by fear and fought by shame,                         °132"
2782,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Shook her weak bosom day and night,"
2783,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Consumed her beauty like a flame,"
2784,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And dimm'd it like the desert-blast.                                 135
2785,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"And though the bed-clothes hide her face,"
2786,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Yet were it lifted to the light,"
2787,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,The sweet expression of her brow
2788,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Would charm the gazer, till his thought"
2789,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Erased the ravages of time,                                          140"
2790,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Fill'd up the hollow cheek, and brought"
2791,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,A freshness back as of her prime--
2792,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,So healing is her quiet now.
2793,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,So perfectly the lines express
2794,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"A tranquil, settled loveliness,                                      145"
2795,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Her younger rival's purest grace.
2796,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2797,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,The air of the December-night
2798,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Steals coldly around the chamber bright,"
2799,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Where those lifeless lovers be;
2800,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Swinging with it, in the light                                       150"
2801,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Flaps the ghostlike tapestry.
2802,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And on the arras wrought you see
2803,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"A stately Huntsman, clad in green,"
2804,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And round him a fresh forest-scene.
2805,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"On that clear forest-knoll he stays,                                 155"
2806,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"With his pack round him, and delays."
2807,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"He stares and stares, with troubled face,"
2808,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"At this huge, gleam-lit fireplace,"
2809,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"At that bright, iron-figured door,"
2810,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And those blown rushes on the floor.                                 160
2811,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,He gazes down into the room
2812,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"With heated cheeks and flurried air,"
2813,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And to himself he seems to say:
2814,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"_""What place is this, and who are they?"
2815,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Who is that kneeling Lady fair?                                      165
2816,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And on his pillows that pale Knight
2817,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Who seems of marble on a tomb?
2818,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"How comes it here, this chamber bright,"
2819,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Through whose mullion'd windows clear
2820,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"The castle-court all wet with rain,                                  170"
2821,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"The drawbridge and the moat appear,"
2822,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"And then the beach, and, mark'd with spray,"
2823,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"The sunken reefs, and far away"
2824,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,The unquiet bright Atlantic plain?
2825,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"--What, has some glamour made me sleep,                              175"
2826,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"And sent me with my dogs to sweep,"
2827,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"By night, with boisterous bugle-peal,"
2828,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Through some old, sea-side, knightly hall,"
2829,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,Not in the free green wood at all?
2830,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"That Knight's asleep, and at her prayer                              180"
2831,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,That Lady by the bed doth kneel--
2832,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Then hush, thou boisterous bugle-peal!""_"
2833,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,--The wild boar rustles in his lair;
2834,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air;
2835,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,But lord and hounds keep rooted there.                               185
2836,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,
2837,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Cheer, cheer thy dogs into the brake,"
2838,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,O Hunter! and without a fear
2839,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,"Thy golden-tassell'd bugle blow,"
2840,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,And through the glades thy pastime take--
2841,ISEULT OF IRELAND°,For thou wilt rouse no sleepers here!                                190

2855,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"In King Marc's chapel, in Tyntagel old--"
2856,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,There in a ship they bore those lovers cold.
2857,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,
2858,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"The young surviving Iseult, one bright day,                            5"
2859,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Had wander'd forth. Her children were at play
2860,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,In a green circular hollow in the heath
2861,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Which borders the sea-shore--a country path
2862,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Creeps over it from the till'd fields behind.
2863,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"The hollow's grassy banks are soft-inclined,                          10"
2864,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"And to one standing on them, far and near"
2865,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear
2866,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Over the waste. This cirque° of open ground                          °13
2867,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Is light and green; the heather, which all round"
2868,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Creeps thickly, grows not here; but the pale grass                    15"
2869,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Is strewn with rocks, and many a shiver'd mass"
2870,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Of vein'd white-gleaming quartz, and here and there"

2872,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,In the smooth centre of the opening stood

2874,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Warm with the winter-sun, of burnish'd green"

2884,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Out of their glossy coverts;--but when now

2886,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Under the feather'd hats of the sweet pair,"
2887,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,In blinding masses shower'd the golden hair--
2888,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Then Iseult call'd them to her, and the three                         35"

2895,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring.
2896,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Long they stay'd still--then, pacing at their ease,"
2897,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Moved up and down under the glossy trees.
2898,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"But still, as they pursued their warm dry road,"
2899,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"From Iseult's lips the unbroken story flow'd,                         45"
2900,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"And still the children listen'd, their blue eyes"
2901,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Fix'd on their mother's face in wide surprise;

2905,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"From the open heath, still by the hedgerows lay,"

2908,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Swooping to landward; nor to where, quite clear,"
2909,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,The fell-fares settled on the thickets near.                          55
2910,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"And they would still have listen'd, till dark night"
2911,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Came keen and chill down on the heather bright;
2912,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"But, when the red glow on the sea grew cold,"
2913,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,And the grey turrets of the castle old
2914,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Look'd sternly through the frosty evening-air,                        60"
2915,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair,"
2916,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"And brought her tale to an end, and found the path,"
2917,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,And led them home over the darkening heath.
2918,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,
2919,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,And is she happy? Does she see unmoved
2920,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,The days in which she might have lived and loved                      65
2921,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Slip without bringing bliss slowly away,"
2922,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"One after one, to-morrow like to-day?"
2923,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Joy has not found her yet, nor ever will--"
2924,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Is it this thought which, makes her mien so still,"
2925,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,                     70"
2926,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet"
2927,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Her children's? She moves slow; her voice alone
2928,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Hath yet an infantine and silver tone,"
2929,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"But even that comes languidly; in truth,"
2930,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,She seems one dying in a mask of youth.                               75
2931,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"And now she will go home, and softly lay"
2932,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Her laughing children in their beds, and play"
2933,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Awhile with them before they sleep; and then
2934,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"She'll light her silver lamp, which fishermen"

2938,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Hour after hour, her gold curls sweeping it;"
2939,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind
2940,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Her children, or to listen to the wind.                               85"
2941,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"And when the clock peals midnight, she will move"
2942,ISEULT OF BRITTANY°,"Her work away, and let her fingers rove"

4380,A SUMMER NIGHT,A SUMMER NIGHT
4381,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4382,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4383,A SUMMER NIGHT,"In the deserted, moon-blanch'd street,"
4384,A SUMMER NIGHT,How lonely rings the echo of my feet!
4385,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Those windows, which I gaze at, frown,"
4386,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Silent and white, unopening down,"
4387,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Repellent as the world;--but see,                                      5"
4388,A SUMMER NIGHT,A break between the housetops shows
4389,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The moon! and, lost behind her, fading dim"
4390,A SUMMER NIGHT,Into the dewy dark obscurity
4391,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Down at the far horizon's rim,"
4392,A SUMMER NIGHT,Doth a whole tract of heaven disclose!                                10
4393,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4394,A SUMMER NIGHT,And to my mind the thought
4395,A SUMMER NIGHT,Is on a sudden brought
4396,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Of a past night, and a far different scene."
4397,A SUMMER NIGHT,Headlands stood out into the moonlit deep
4398,A SUMMER NIGHT,As clearly as at noon;                                                15
4399,A SUMMER NIGHT,The spring-tide's brimming flow
4400,A SUMMER NIGHT,Heaved dazzlingly between;
4401,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Houses, with long white sweep,"
4402,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4403,A SUMMER NIGHT,Girdled the glistening bay;
4404,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Behind, through the soft air,                                         20"
4405,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The blue haze-cradled mountains spread away,"
4406,A SUMMER NIGHT,The night was far more fair--
4407,A SUMMER NIGHT,"But the same restless pacings to and fro,"
4408,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And the same vainly throbbing heart was there,"
4409,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And the same bright, calm moon.                                       25"
4410,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4411,A SUMMER NIGHT,And the calm moonlight seems to say:
4412,A SUMMER NIGHT,"_Hast thou then still the old unquiet breast,"
4413,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Which neither deadens into rest,"
4414,A SUMMER NIGHT,Nor ever feels the fiery glow
4415,A SUMMER NIGHT,"That whirls the spirit from itself away_,                             30"
4416,A SUMMER NIGHT,"_But fluctuates to and fro,"
4417,A SUMMER NIGHT,Never by passion quite possess'd
4418,A SUMMER NIGHT,And never quite benumb'd by the world's sway?--_
4419,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And I, I know not if to pray"
4420,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Still to be what I am, or yield and be                                35"
4421,A SUMMER NIGHT,Like all the other men I see.
4422,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4423,A SUMMER NIGHT,"For most men in a brazen prison live,"
4424,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Where, in the sun's hot eye,"
4425,A SUMMER NIGHT,"With heads bent o'er their toil, they languidly"
4426,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Their lives to some unmeaning taskwork give,                          40"
4427,A SUMMER NIGHT,Dreaming of nought beyond their prison-wall.
4428,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And as, year after year,"
4429,A SUMMER NIGHT,Fresh products of their barren labour fall
4430,A SUMMER NIGHT,"From their tired hands, and rest"
4431,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Never yet comes more near,                                            45"
4432,A SUMMER NIGHT,Gloom settles slowly down over their breast;
4433,A SUMMER NIGHT,A while they try to stem
4434,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The waves of mournful thought by which they are prest,"
4435,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And the rest, a few,"
4436,A SUMMER NIGHT,Escape their prison and depart                                        50
4437,A SUMMER NIGHT,On the wide ocean of life anew.
4438,A SUMMER NIGHT,"There the freed prisoner, where'er his heart"
4439,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Listeth, will sail;"
4440,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Nor doth he know how these prevail,"
4441,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Despotic on that sea,                                                 55"
4442,A SUMMER NIGHT,Trade-winds which cross it from eternity.
4443,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Awhile he holds some false way, undebarr'd"
4444,A SUMMER NIGHT,"By thwarting signs, and braves"
4445,A SUMMER NIGHT,The freshening wind and blackening waves
4446,A SUMMER NIGHT,And then the tempest strikes him; and between                         60
4447,A SUMMER NIGHT,The lightning-bursts is seen
4448,A SUMMER NIGHT,Only a driving wreck.
4449,A SUMMER NIGHT,And the pale master on his spar-strewn deck
4450,A SUMMER NIGHT,"With anguished face and flying hair,"
4451,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Grasping the rudder hard,                                             65"
4452,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Still bent to make some port he knows not where,"
4453,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Still standing for some false, impossible shore."
4454,A SUMMER NIGHT,And sterner comes the roar
4455,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Of sea and wind, and through the deepening gloom"
4456,A SUMMER NIGHT,Fainter and fainter wreck and helmsman loom                           70
4457,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And he, too, disappears and comes no more."
4458,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4459,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Is there no life, but there alone?"
4460,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Madman or slave, must man be one?"
4461,A SUMMER NIGHT,Plainness and clearness without shadow of stain!
4462,A SUMMER NIGHT,Clearness divine.                                                     75
4463,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Ye heavens, whose pure dark regions have no sign"
4464,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Of languor, though so calm, and though so great"
4465,A SUMMER NIGHT,Are yet untroubled and unpassionate;
4466,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Who though so noble, share in the world's toil."
4467,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And, though so task'd, keep free from dust and soil!                  80"
4468,A SUMMER NIGHT,
4469,A SUMMER NIGHT,I will not say that your mild deeps retain
4470,A SUMMER NIGHT,"A tinge, it may be, of their silent pain"
4471,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Who have longed deeply once, and longed in vain--"
4472,A SUMMER NIGHT,But I will rather say that you remain
4473,A SUMMER NIGHT,"A world above man's head, to let him see                              85"
4474,A SUMMER NIGHT,"How boundless might his soul's horizon be,"
4475,A SUMMER NIGHT,"How vast, yet of which clear transparency!"
4476,A SUMMER NIGHT,"How it were good to live there, and breathe free!"
4477,A SUMMER NIGHT,How fair a lot to fill
4478,A SUMMER NIGHT,Is left to each man still!                                            90

5903,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"The following synopsis of the story of Sohrab and Rustum the ""tale"
5904,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"replete with tears,"" is gathered from several sources, chiefly"
5905,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Benjamin's _Persia_, in _The Story of the Nations_, Sir John Malcolm's"
5906,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"_History of Persia_, and the great Persian epic poem, _Shah Nameh_."
5907,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"The _Shah Nameh_ the original source of the story, and which purports"
5908,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,to narrate the exploits of Persia's kings and champions over a space
5909,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"of thirty-six centuries, bears the same relation to Persian literature"
5910,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"as the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ to the Greek, and the _Æneid_ to the"
5911,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Latin, though in structure it more nearly resembles _Morte d'Arthur_,"
5912,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,which records in order the achievements of various heroes. In it
5913,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"the native poet Mansur ibn Ahmad, afterwards known to literature"
5914,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"as Firdausi, the Paradisaical, has set down the early tales and"
5915,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,traditions of his people with all the vividness and color common to
5916,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"oriental writers. The principal hero of the poem is the mighty Rustum,"
5917,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"who, mounted on his famous horse Ruksh, performed prodigies of valor"
5918,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,in defence of the Persian throne. Of all his adventures his encounter
5919,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,with Sohrab is the most dramatic. The poem was probably written in
5920,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"the latter half of the tenth century. As will be seen, the incidents"
5921,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,narrated in Arnold's poem form but an episode in the complete story of
5922,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,the two champions.                                                 [150]
5923,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
5924,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Rustum (or Rustem), having killed a wild ass while hunting on the"
5925,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Turanian frontier, and having feasted on its flesh, composed himself"
5926,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"to sleep, leaving his faithful steed, Ruksh (or Raksh), to graze"
5927,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"untethered. On awakening, he found his horse had disappeared, and"
5928,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"believing it had been stolen, the warrior proceeded towards Semenjan,"
5929,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"a near-by city, in hopes of recovering his property. On the way, he"
5930,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,learned that Ruksh had been found by the servants of the king and was
5931,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"stabled at Semenjan, as he had surmised. Upon Rustum's demand, the"
5932,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"steed was promptly restored to him, and he was about to depart when he"
5933,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,was prevailed upon to accept the king's invitation to tarry awhile and
5934,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,rest himself in feasting and idleness.
5935,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
5936,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Now the king of Semenjan had a fair daughter named Tahmineh, who had"
5937,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,become enamoured of Rustum because of his mighty exploits. Susceptible
5938,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"as she was beautiful, she made her attachment so evident that the"
5939,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"young hero, who was as ardent as he was brave, readily yielded to"
5940,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,the power of her fascination. The consent of the king having been
5941,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"obtained, Rustum and Tahmineh were married with all the rites"
5942,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,prescribed by the laws of the country. A peculiar feature of this
5943,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,alliance lay in the fact that the king of Semenjan was feudatory to
5944,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Afrasiab, the deadly enemy of Persia, while Rustum was her greatest"
5945,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"champion. At this time, however, the two countries were at peace."
5946,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,[151]
5947,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"For a time all went happily, then Rustum found it necessary to leave"
5948,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"his bride, as he thought, for only a short time. At parting he gave"
5949,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"her an onyx, which he wore on his arm, bidding her, if a daughter"
5950,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"should be born to their union, to twine the gem in her hair under a"
5951,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"fortunate star; but if a son, to bind it on his arm, and he would be"
5952,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,insured a glorious career. Rustum then mounted Ruksh and rode away--as
5953,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"time proved, never to return."
5954,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
5955,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"The months went by, and to the lonely bride was born a marvellous son,"
5956,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"whom, because of his comely features, she named Sohrab. Fearing Rustum"
5957,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"would send for the boy when he grew older, and thus rob her of her"
5958,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"treasure, Tahmineh sent word to him that the child was a girl--""no"
5959,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"son,"" and Rustum took no further interest in it."
5960,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
5961,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"While still of tender years, Sohrab showed signs of his noble lineage."
5962,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"He early displayed a love for horses, and at the age of ten years,"
5963,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"according to the tradition, was large and handsome and highly"
5964,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,accomplished in the use of arms. Realizing at length that he was of
5965,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"lofty descent, he insisted that his mother, who had concealed the"
5966,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"fact, should inform him of the name of his father. Being told that it"
5967,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"was the renowned Rustum, he exclaimed, ""Since he is my father, I shall"
5968,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,go to his aid; he shall become king of Persia and together we shall
5969,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"rule the world."" After this the youth caused a horse worthy of him to"
5970,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"be found, and with the aid of his grandfather, the king of Semenjan,"
5971,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"he prepared to go on the quest, attended by a mighty host."
5972,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
5973,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"When Afrasiab, the Turanian ruler, learned that Sohrab was going to"
5974,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"war with the Persians, he was greatly pleased, and after counselling"
5975,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"with his wise men, decided openly to assist him in his enterprises,"
5976,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,with the expectation that both Rustum and Sohrab would fall in battle
5977,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,and Persia be at his mercy. He accordingly sent an army of auxiliaries
5978,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"to Sohrab, accompanied by two astute courtiers, Houman and Barman,"
5979,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"who, under the guise of friendship, were to act as counsellors to"
5980,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,the young leader. These he ordered to keep the knowledge of their
5981,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,relationship from father and son and to seek to bring about an
5982,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"encounter between them, in the hope that Sohrab would slay Rustum,"
5983,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Afrasiab's most dreaded foeman, after which the unsuspecting youth"
5984,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,might easily be disposed of by treachery.                          [152]
5985,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
5986,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Sohrab, with his army and that of Afrasiab, set out, intending to"
5987,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"fight his way until Rustum should be sent against him, when he would"
5988,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,reveal himself to his father and form an alliance with him that would
5989,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"place the line of Seistan on the throne. On the way southward, Sohrab"
5990,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"overthrew and captured the Persian champion, Hujir, and the same"
5991,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"day conquered the warrior maiden Gurdafrid, whose beauty and tears,"
5992,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"however, prevailed upon him to release her. Guzdehern, father of"
5993,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Gurdafrid, recognizing Sohrab's prowess, and alarmed for the safety"
5994,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"of the Persian throne, secretly despatched a courier to the king Kai"
5995,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Kaoos to warn him of the young Tartar's approach. Kaoos, in great"
5996,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"terror, sent for Rustum to hurry to his aid. Regardless of the king's"
5997,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"request, Rustum spent eight days in feasting, then presented himself"
5998,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"at the court. Kaoos, angered at the delay, ordered both the champion"
5999,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,and the messenger to be executed forthwith; but Rustum effected his
6000,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"escape on Ruksh, and returned to Seistan, leaving Persia to her fate."
6001,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"The king's wrath, however, soon gave place to fear; and recognizing"
6002,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"the danger of his throne unsupported by Rustum's valor, he despatched"
6003,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,messengers to him with humble petitions and apologies. After much
6004,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"protesting, Rustum finally yielded and accompanied the Persian army,"
6005,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"under the king Kai Kaoos, which at once set forth to encounter Sohrab."
6006,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6007,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"The morning before the opening of hostilities, Sohrab, taking the"
6008,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Persian Hujir, whom he still held a prisoner, to the top of a rocky"
6009,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"eminence, ordered him to point out the tents of the chief warriors"
6010,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"of the Persian army, particularly Rustum's. But Hujir, fearing lest"
6011,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Sohrab should attack Rustum unexpectedly and so overcome him, declared"
6012,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,that the great chieftain's tent was not among those on the plain
6013,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"below. Disappointed at his failure to find his father, Sohrab led his"
6014,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"army in a fierce onslaught on the Persians, driving them in confusion"
6015,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"before him. In this dire extremity Kai Kaoos sent for Rustum, who was"
6016,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,somewhat apart from the main troop. Exclaiming that the king never
6017,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"sent for him except when he had got himself into trouble, the warrior"
6018,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"armed, mounted Ruksh, and rushed to the combat. By mutual consent the"
6019,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"two champions withdrew to a retired spot, where, unmolested, they"
6020,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,might fight out their quarrel hand to hand. As they approached each
6021,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"other, Rustum, moved with compassion by the youth of his foe, tried"
6022,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"to dissuade Sohrab from his purpose, and counselled him to retire."
6023,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Sohrab, filled with sudden hope,--an instinctive feeling that the"
6024,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"father whom he was seeking stood before him,--eagerly demanded whether"
6025,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"this were Rustum. But Rustum, fearing treachery, said he was only an"
6026,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"ordinary man, having neither palace nor princely kingdom--not Rustum."
6027,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6028,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"They marked off the lists, and, mounted on their powerful horses,"
6029,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"fought first with javelins, then with swords, clubs, and bows and"
6030,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"arrows. After several hours of fighting both were exhausted, and by"
6031,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,tacit consent they retired to opposite sides of the lists for rest.
6032,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"When the combat was renewed, Sohrab gained a slight advantage. A truce"
6033,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"was then made for the night, and the warriors returned to their tents"
6034,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,to prepare for the morrow.
6035,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6036,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,With daybreak the struggle was renewed. To prevent the armies from
6037,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"intervening or engaging in battle, they were removed to a distance of"
6038,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"several miles. Midway between, Sohrab and Rustum met in the midst of a"
6039,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"lonely, treeless waste. More convinced than before that his adversary"
6040,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"was Rustum, Sohrab sought to bring about a reconciliation, but Rustum"
6041,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,refused. This time they fought on foot. From morning till afternoon
6042,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"they fought, neither gaining any decided advantage. At last Sohrab"
6043,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"succeeded in felling Rustum to the earth, and was about to slay him,"
6044,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,when the Persian called out that it was not the custom in chivalrous
6045,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,warfare to slay a champion until he was thrown the second time.
6046,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Sohrab, generous as brave, released his prostrate foe; and again"
6047,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,father and son parted.                                             [154]
6048,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6049,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Rustum, scarcely believing himself alive after such an escape,"
6050,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"purified himself with water, and prayed that his wounds might be"
6051,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,healed and his accustomed strength restored to him. Never before had
6052,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,he been so beset in battle.
6053,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6054,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"With morning came the renewal of the combat, both champions"
6055,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"determining to end it that day. Late in the evening Rustum, by a"
6056,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"supreme effort, seized Sohrab around the waist and hurled him to the"
6057,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"ground. Then, fearing lest the youth prove too strong for him in the"
6058,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"end, he drew his blade and plunged it into Sohrab's bosom."
6059,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6060,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"Sohrab forgave Rustum, but warned him to beware the vengeance of his"
6061,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"father, the mighty Rustum, who must soon learn that he had slain his"
6062,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"son Sohrab. ""I went out to seek my father,"" cried the dying youth,"
6063,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"""for my mother had told me by what tokens I should know him, and I"
6064,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"perish for longing after him.... Yet I say unto thee, if thou shouldst"
6065,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"become a fish that swimmeth in the depths of the ocean, if thou"
6066,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"shouldst change into a star that is concealed in the farthest heaven,"
6067,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"my father would draw thee forth from thy hiding-place, and avenge my"
6068,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"death upon thee, when he shall learn that the earth is become my bed."
6069,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"For my father is Rustum the Pehliva, and it shall be told unto him,"
6070,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"how that Sohrab his son perished in the quest after his face."" These"
6071,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"words were as death to the aged hero, who fell senseless at the side"
6072,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,of his wounded son. When he had recovered he called in despair for
6073,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,proofs of what Sohrab had said. The now dying youth tore open his mail
6074,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,and showed his father the onyx which his mother had bound on his arm
6075,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,as directed.                                                       [155]
6076,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6077,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,The sight of his own signet rendered Rustum quite frantic; he cursed
6078,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"himself, and would have put an end to his existence but for the"
6079,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,efforts of his expiring son. After Sohrab's death he burnt his tents
6080,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"and carried the corpse to his father's home in Seistan, and buried"
6081,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"it there. The Tartar army, agreeable to Sohrab's last request, was"
6082,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,permitted to return home unmolested. When the tidings of Sohrab's
6083,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"death reached his mother, she was inconsolable, and died in less than"
6084,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,a year.
6085,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,
6086,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,In the main the story as told by Arnold follows the original
6087,SOHRAB AND RUSTUM,"narrative. A careful investigation of the alterations made, and the"

6615,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,The story of Tristram and Iseult is one of the most vivid and
6616,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"passionate of the Arthurian cycle of legends, and is a favorite with"
6617,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,the poets. The following version is abridged from Dunlop's _History of

6620,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"""In the court of his uncle, King Marc, the king of Cornwall, who at"
6621,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"this time resided at the castle of Tyntagel, Tristram became expert"

6623,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"solicitation, promised to bestow his daughter Iseult in marriage on"
6624,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,King Marc.... The mother of Iseult gave to her daughter's confidante
6625,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"a philtre, or love-potion, to be administered on the night of her"
6626,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,nuptials. Of this beverage Tristram and Iseult unfortunately partook.

6633,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"Tristram, being forced to leave Cornwall on account of the displeasure"
6634,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"of his uncle, repaired to Brittany, where lived Iseult with the White"
6635,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"Hands. He married her, more out of gratitude than love. Afterwards"
6636,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,he proceeded to the dominions of Arthur which became the theatre of

6639,TRISTRAM AND ISEULT,"""Tristram, subsequent to these events, returned to Brittany and to"

7511,PALLADIUM,
7512,PALLADIUM,At the time of the Trojan war there was in the citadel of Troy a

7514,PALLADIUM,"reputed to have fallen from heaven as the gift of Zeus, and the belief"
7515,PALLADIUM,was that the city could not be taken so long as this statue remained

8037,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY,care and effort and gain and pressure of the world are sapping human
8038,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY,"strength, he ends with a picture of the old-world pride and daring,"
8039,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY,which exhibits human strength in its freshness and vigor.... I could
8040,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY,quote poem after poem which Arnold closes by some such buoyant
8041,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY,digression: a buoyant digression intended to shake off the tone of
8042,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY,"melancholy, and to remind us that the world of imaginative life is"
8043,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY,"still wide open to us.... This problem is insoluble, he seems to say,"

8100,THYRSIS,
8101,THYRSIS,Thyrsis is a name common to both ancient and modern literature. In
8102,THYRSIS,the Idyls of Theocritus it is used as the name of a herdsman; in the
8103,THYRSIS,"Eclogues of Vergil, of a shepherd; while in later writings it has come"
8104,THYRSIS,to mean any rustic.
8105,THYRSIS,
8106,THYRSIS,"Arthur Hugh Clough (1819-1861), whose poetry is closely akin in spirit"
8107,THYRSIS,"to Arnold's, was a young man of genius and promise. He studied at both"
8108,THYRSIS,"Rugby and Oxford, where he and Arnold were intimately associated and"
8109,THYRSIS,"became fast friends. In 1869 his health began to fail, and two years"
8110,THYRSIS,"later he died in Florence, Italy, where he had gone in the hope of"
8111,THYRSIS,being benefited by the climate.
8112,THYRSIS,
8113,THYRSIS,"Arnold, in a letter to his mother dated April, 1866, says of his poem:"
8114,THYRSIS,"""Tell dear old Edward [Arnold] that the diction of the Thyrsis was"
8115,THYRSIS,"modelled on that of Theocritus, whom I have been much reading during"
8116,THYRSIS,"the two years this poem has been forming itself, and that I meant the"
8117,THYRSIS,"diction to be so artless as to be almost heedless. However, there is"
8118,THYRSIS,"a mean which must not be passed, and before I reprint this I will"
8119,THYRSIS,consider well all objections. The images are all from actual
8120,THYRSIS,"observation.... The cuckoo in the wet June morning, I heard in the"
8121,THYRSIS,"garden at Woodford, and all those three stanzas, which you like, are"
8122,THYRSIS,"reminiscences of Woodford. Edward has, I think, fixed on the two"
8123,THYRSIS,"stanzas I myself like best: 'O easy access,' and 'And long the way"
8124,THYRSIS,"appears.' I also like 'Where is the girl,' and the stanza before it;"
8125,THYRSIS,but that is because they bring certain places and moments before
8126,THYRSIS,"me.... It is probably too quiet a poem for the general taste, but I"
8127,THYRSIS,"think it will stand wear."" To his friend, John Campbell Shairp, Arnold"
8128,THYRSIS,"wrote, a few days later: ""Thyrsis is a very quiet poem, but, I think,"
8129,THYRSIS,"solid and sincere. It will not be popular, however. It had long been"
8130,THYRSIS,"in my head to connect Clough with that Cumner country, and, when I"
8131,THYRSIS,"began, I was carried irresistibly into this form. You say, truly, that"
8132,THYRSIS,"there was much in Clough (the whole prophetic side, in fact) which one"
8133,THYRSIS,"cannot deal with in this way.... Still, Clough had the idyllic side,"
8134,THYRSIS,too; to deal with this suited my desire to deal again with that Cumner
8135,THYRSIS,"country. Anyway, only so could I treat the matter this time. _Valeat"
8136,THYRSIS,"quantum_.""                                                         [204]"

8293,THYRSIS,"poetry, was said to have followed into Phrygia his mistress Piplea,"
8294,THYRSIS,"who had been carried off by robbers, and to have found her in the"
8295,THYRSIS,"power of the king of Phrygia, Lityerses. Lityerses used to make"
8296,THYRSIS,"strangers try a contest with him in reaping corn, and to put them to"
8297,THYRSIS,"death if he overcame them. Hercules arrived in time to save Daphnis,"
8298,THYRSIS,"took upon himself the reaping contest with Lityerses, overcame him,"
8299,THYRSIS,"and slew him. The Lityerses-song connected with this tradition was,"
8300,THYRSIS,"like the Linus-song, one of the early, plaintive strains of Greek"
8301,THYRSIS,"popular poetry, and used to be sung by the corn reapers. Other"
8302,THYRSIS,"traditions represented Daphnis as beloved by a nymph, who exacted from"
8303,THYRSIS,"him an oath to love no one else. He fell in love with a princess, and"
8304,THYRSIS,"was struck blind by the jealous nymph. Mercury, who was his father,"
8305,THYRSIS,"raised him to heaven, and made a fountain spring up in the place from"
8306,THYRSIS,which he ascended. At this fountain the Sicilians offered yearly
8307,THYRSIS,"sacrifices. See Servius, _Comment, in Vergil. Bucol_., V, 20, and"

8340,RUGBY CHAPEL,"_Rugby Chapel_ (1857), one of Arnold's best-known and most"
8341,RUGBY CHAPEL,"characteristic productions, was written in memory of his father, Dr."
8342,RUGBY CHAPEL,"Thomas Arnold, famous as the great head-master at Rugby. Dr. Arnold"
8343,RUGBY CHAPEL,"was born at East Cowes in the Isle of Wight, June 13, 1795, and as a"
8344,RUGBY CHAPEL,boy was at school at Warminster and Winchester. In 1811 he entered
8345,RUGBY CHAPEL,"Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and having won recognition as a"
8346,RUGBY CHAPEL,"scholar, was awarded a fellowship of the Oriel in 1815. Three years"
8347,RUGBY CHAPEL,"later he settled at Laleham, where, in 1820, he married Mary Penrose,"
8348,RUGBY CHAPEL,"daughter of Justice Penrose, and where, two years later, was born"
8349,RUGBY CHAPEL,"Matthew, who was destined to win marked distinction among English men"
8350,RUGBY CHAPEL,"of letters. In 1827 he was elected head-master at Rugby, and shortly"
8351,RUGBY CHAPEL,afterward began those important reforms which have placed him among
8352,RUGBY CHAPEL,the greatest educators of his century. Chief among his writings is
8353,RUGBY CHAPEL,"his _History of Rome_, published in several volumes. In 1841 he was"
8354,RUGBY CHAPEL,appointed Regius Professor of History at Oxford. He died very suddenly
8355,RUGBY CHAPEL,"on Sunday, June 12, 1842, and on the following Friday his remains"
8356,RUGBY CHAPEL,"were interred in the chancel of Rugby Chapel, immediately under the"
8357,RUGBY CHAPEL,communion table.                                                   [210]
8358,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8359,RUGBY CHAPEL,"In his poem Arnold has drawn a vivid picture of a strong, helpful,"
8360,RUGBY CHAPEL,"hopeful, unselfish soul, cheering and supporting his weaker comrades"
8361,RUGBY CHAPEL,in their upward and onward march--a picture of the guide and companion
8362,RUGBY CHAPEL,of his earlier years; and in so doing he has preserved his father's
8363,RUGBY CHAPEL,memory to posterity in a striking and an abiding way.
8364,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8365,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8366,RUGBY CHAPEL,"=1-13=. Note carefully the tone of these introductory lines, and"
8367,RUGBY CHAPEL,determine the poet's purpose in opening the poem in this mood. The
8368,RUGBY CHAPEL,"picture inevitably calls to mind Bryant's lines, _The Death of"
8369,RUGBY CHAPEL,Flowers_.
8370,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8371,RUGBY CHAPEL,=16. gloom=. The key-word to the preceding lines. Explain why it calls
8372,RUGBY CHAPEL,to mind the poet's father. Keats makes a similar use of the word
8373,RUGBY CHAPEL,_forlorn_ in his _Ode to the Nightingale_.
8374,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8375,RUGBY CHAPEL,"""... forlorn."
8376,RUGBY CHAPEL,Forlorn! the very word is like a bell

8378,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8379,RUGBY CHAPEL,=30-33=. Discuss the figure as to its aptness.
8380,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8381,RUGBY CHAPEL,=37. shore=. A word common to hymns.
8382,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8383,RUGBY CHAPEL,=38-57=. Discuss the poet's idea of the future life as set forth in
8384,RUGBY CHAPEL,these lines. Can you think of any other author or authors who have
8385,RUGBY CHAPEL,held a like view?
8386,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8387,RUGBY CHAPEL,=58-59=. The poet asks this question only to answer it in the lines
8388,RUGBY CHAPEL,following. Compare and contrast the two classes of men spoken of;
8389,RUGBY CHAPEL,their aims in life and their achievements. Why is the path of those
8390,RUGBY CHAPEL,"who have chosen a ""clear-purposed goal"" pictured so difficult? Who are"
8391,RUGBY CHAPEL,"they that start well, but fall out by the wayside?                 [211]"
8392,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8393,RUGBY CHAPEL,"=90-93=. Compare with Byron's description of a storm in the Alps,"
8394,RUGBY CHAPEL,"Canto III, _Childe Harold_."

8396,RUGBY CHAPEL,"""Far along,"
8397,RUGBY CHAPEL,"From peak to peak, the rattling crags among"
8398,RUGBY CHAPEL,"Leaps the live thunder."""
8399,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8400,RUGBY CHAPEL,"=98-101=. So unstable is the hold of the ""snow-beds"" on the mountain"
8401,RUGBY CHAPEL,sides that travellers passing beneath them are forbidden by the guides
8402,RUGBY CHAPEL,"to speak, lest their voices precipitate an avalanche. See ll. 160-169,"
8403,RUGBY CHAPEL,_Sohrab and Rustum_.
8404,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8405,RUGBY CHAPEL,=117-123=. What human frailties are indicated in the answer to the
8406,RUGBY CHAPEL,host's question? Note the contrast in the succeeding lines.
8407,RUGBY CHAPEL,
8408,RUGBY CHAPEL,=124-144=. The imagery of these lines is drawn from Dr. Arnold's
8409,RUGBY CHAPEL,life at Rugby. Under his care frequent excursions were made into the
8410,RUGBY CHAPEL,neighboring Westmoreland Hills. Nothing perhaps gives a better idea of
8411,RUGBY CHAPEL,"the man than the description of his ""delight in those long mountain"
8412,RUGBY CHAPEL,"walks, when they would start with their provisions for the day,"
8413,RUGBY CHAPEL,"himself the guide and life of the party, always on the lookout how"
8414,RUGBY CHAPEL,"best to break the ascent by gentle stages, comforting the little ones"
8415,RUGBY CHAPEL,"in their falls and helping forward those who were tired, himself"
8416,RUGBY CHAPEL,"always keeping with the laggers, that none might strain their strength"
8417,RUGBY CHAPEL,"by trying to be in front with him; and then, when his assistance was"
8418,RUGBY CHAPEL,"not wanted, the liveliest of all--his step so light, his eye so"
