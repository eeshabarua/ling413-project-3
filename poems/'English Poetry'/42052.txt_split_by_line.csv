76,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Through skies blown clear by storm, o’er storm-spent seas,"
77,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Day kindled pale with promise of full noon
78,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Of blue unclouded; no night-weary wind
79,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Ruffled the slumberous, heaving deeps to white,"
80,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Though round the Farne Isles the waves never sink
81,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,In foamless sleep--about the pillared crags
82,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For ever circling with unresting spray.
83,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"At dawn’s first glimmer, from his island-cell--"
84,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Rock-hewn, secure from tempest--Oswald came"
85,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With slow and weary step, white-faced and worn"
86,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With night-long vigil for storm-perilled souls.
87,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His anxious eye with sharp foreboding bright--
88,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,He scanned the treacherous flood; the long froth-trail
89,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That marks the lurking reefs; the jag-toothed chasms
90,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Which, foaming, gape at night beneath the keel--"
91,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The mouth of hell to storm-bewildered ships:
92,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,But no scar-stranded vessel met his glance.
93,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Relieved, he drank the glistering calm of morn,"
94,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With nostril keen and warm lips parted wide;
95,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"While, gradually, the sun-enkindled air"
96,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Quickened his pallid cheek with youthful flame,"
97,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Though lonely years had silvered his dark head,"
98,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And round his eyes had woven shadow-meshes.
99,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Clearly he caught the ever-clamorous cries
100,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of guillemot and puffin from afar,"
101,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Where, canopied by hovering, white wings,"
102,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,They crowded naked pinnacles of rock.
103,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He watched, with eyes of glistening tenderness,"
104,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The brooding eider--Cuthbert’s sacred bird,"
105,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That bears among the isles his saintly name--
106,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Breast the calm waves; a black, wet-gleaming fin"
107,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Cleft the blue waters with a foaming jag,"
108,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Where, close behind the restless herring-herd,"
109,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With ravening maw of death, the porpoise sped."
110,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Oswald, light-tranced, dreamed in the sun awhile;"
111,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Till, suddenly, as some old sorrow starts,"
112,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Though years have glided by with soothing lull,"
113,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The gust of ancient longing rent his bliss:
114,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"His narrow isle, as by some darkling spell,"
115,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,More narrow shrank; the gulls’ unceasing cries
116,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Grew still more fretful; and his hermit-life
117,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,A sea-scourged desolation to him seemed.
118,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The holy tree of peace--which he had dreamt
119,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Would flourish in the wilderness afresh,"
120,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Upspringing ever in new ecstasy
121,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of branching beauty and white blooms of truth,"
122,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Till its star-tangling crest should cleave the sky,"
123,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And angels rustle through its topmost boughs--
124,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Seemed sapless, rootless.  Through his quivering limbs"
125,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His famine-wasted youth to life upleapt
126,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With passionate yearning for humanity:
127,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The stir of towns; the jostling of glad throngs;
128,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Welcoming faces and warm-clasping hands;
129,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yea, even for the lips and eyes of Love"
130,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,He hungered with keen pangs of old desire:
131,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, if for him these might not be, he craved"
132,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,At least the exultation of swift peril--
133,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The red-foamed riot of delirious strife
134,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That rears a bloody crest o’er peaceful shires,"
135,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, slaying, in a swirl of slaughter dies."
136,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With brow uplifted and strained, pulsing throat,"
137,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And salt-parched lips out-thrust, unto the sun"
138,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He stretched beseeching hands, as though he sought"
139,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To snatch some glittering disaster thence.
140,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,One moment radiant thus; and then once more
141,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"His arms dropped listless, and he slowly shrank"
142,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Within his sea-stained habit, cowering dark"
143,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Amid the azure blaze of sea and sky.
144,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, stirring, with impatient step he moved"
145,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Across the isle to where the rocky shore,"
146,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Forming a little, crag-encircled bay,"
147,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Sloped steeply to the level of the sea;
148,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But, as he neared the edges of the tide,"
149,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Startled, he paused, as, marvelling, he saw"
150,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"A woman on the shelving, wet, black rock,"
151,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Lying, forlorn, among the storm-wrack, white"
152,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And motionless; still wet, her raiment clung"
153,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"About her limbs, and with her wet, gold hair"
154,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Green sea-weed tangled.  Oswald on her looked
155,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Amazed, as one who, in a sea-born trance,"
156,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Discovers the lone spirit of the storm,"
157,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Self-spent at last, and sunk in dreamless slumber"
158,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Within some caverned gloom.  Coldly he watched
159,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The little waves creep up the glistening rock,"
160,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, faltering, slide once more into the deep,"
161,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As though they feared to waken her: at length,"
162,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When one, more venturous, about her stole,"
163,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And moved her heavy hair as if with life,"
164,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,He shuddered; and a lightning-knowledge struck
165,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His heart with fear; and in a flash he knew
166,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That no sea-phantom couched before him lay,"
167,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But some frail fellow-creature, tempest-tost,"
168,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Hung yet in peril on the edge of death,"
169,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Her weak life slipping from the saving grasp
170,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"While he delayed.  He sprang through plashy weed,"
171,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"O’er slippery ridges, to the rock whereon"
172,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,She lay with upturned face and close-shut eyes--
173,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"One hand across her breast, the other dipped"
174,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Within a shallow pool of emerald water,"
175,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With blue-veined fingers clutching the red fronds
176,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of frail sea-weed.  Then Oswald, bending, felt"
177,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Upon his cheek the feeble breath that still
178,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Fluttered between the pallid, parted lips."
179,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In trembling haste, he loosed the sodden cords"
180,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That bound her to a spar; and with hot hands
181,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He chafed her icy limbs, until the glow"
182,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Of life returned.  With fitful quivering
183,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The white lids opened; and she looked on him
184,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With dull, unwondering eyes whose deep-sea blue"
185,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The gloom of death’s late passing shadowed yet;
186,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When suddenly light thrilled them, and bright fear"
187,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Flashed from their depths, and, with a little gasp,"
188,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,She strove to rise; but Oswald with quick words
189,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Calmed her weak terror, and she sank once more,"
190,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Closing her eyes; and, gently lifting her"
191,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Within his arms--her gold hair hanging straight
192,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And heavy with sea-water, as he plunged"
193,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Knee-deep through pools of crackling bladder-weed--
194,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He bore her, unresisting, o’er the isle"
195,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Unto the rock-built shelter he had reared,"
196,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Some little way apart from his own cell,"
197,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For storm-stayed fishers or wrecked mariners.
198,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He laid her on a bed of withered bents,"
199,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And ministered to her with gentle hands
200,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And ceaseless care; till, wrapped in warm, deep sleep,"
201,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,She sank oblivious.  Silently he placed
202,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"His island-fare beside her on the board,"
203,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Lest she should wake in need; then, with hushed step,"
204,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He turned to go; but, ere he reached the door,"
205,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He paused, and looked again towards the bed,"
206,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,As though he feared his strange sea-guest might flee
207,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Like some wild spirit, born of wondering foam,"
208,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That wins from man the shelter of his breast,"
209,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, on a night of moon-enchanted tides,"
210,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Leaps with shrill laughter to its native seas,"
211,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Bearing his soul within its glistening arms,"
212,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To drown his peace on earth and hope of heaven
213,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,In cold eternities of lightless deeps.
214,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But still in dreamless sleep the stranger lay,"
215,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With parted lips and breathing soft and calm;
216,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"About her head unloosed, her hair outshone,"
217,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Among the grey-green bents, like fine, red gold."
218,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"So beautiful she was that Oswald, pierced"
219,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With quivering rapture, dared no longer bide,"
220,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But, with quick fingers, softly raised the latch,"
221,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And stumbled o’er the threshold.  As he went,"
222,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,A flock of sea-gulls from the bent-thatched roof
223,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Rose, querulous, and round him, wheeling, swept,"
224,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With creaking wings and cold, black eyes agleam;"
225,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet Oswald saw them not, nor heard their cries;"
226,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Nor saw he, as he paced the eastern crags,"
227,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"How, round the Farnes, the dreaming ocean lay"
228,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In broad, unshadowed, sapphire ecstasy,"
229,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That glowed to noon through slow, uncounted hours."
230,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His early gloom had vanished; time and space
231,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And earth and sea no longer compassed him;
232,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,One thought alone consumed him--beauty slept
233,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Within the shelter of his hermitage,"
234,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Upon grey, rustling bents, with golden hair."
235,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He roamed, unresting, till the copper sun"
236,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Sank in a steel-grey sea, and earth and sky"
237,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Were strewn with shadows--wavering and dim--
238,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"To weave a pathway for the dawning moon,"
239,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That she, from night’s oblivion, might create"
240,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With the cold spell of her enchantments old
241,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"A phantom earth with magical, bright seas,"
242,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,A vaster heaven of unrevealed stars.
243,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Unmoving, on a headland of swart crag"
244,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That jutted gaunt and sharp against the night,"
245,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Stood Oswald, cowled and silent.  Hour by hour"
246,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He gazed across the sea, which nothing shadowed,"
247,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Save where--now dim, now white--a lonely sail"
248,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Hung, restless, o’er a fisher’s barren toil."
249,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Yet Oswald saw nor sail nor moon nor sea:
250,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His heart kept vigil by the little house
251,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Wherein the stranger slumbered; and it seemed
252,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"His life, by some strange power within him stayed,"
253,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Awaited the unlatching of the door.
254,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
255,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But now, within the hut, the sleeper dreamt"
256,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Of foaming caverns and o’erwhelming waters;
257,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, shuddering awake, awhile she lay,"
258,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And watched the moonlight, cold and white, which poured"
259,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Through the warm dusk, from the high window-slit;"
260,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When, all at once, the strangeness of the room"
261,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Closed in upon her with bewildering dread.
262,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She stirred; the bents, beneath her, rustled strange;"
263,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She started in affright, and, swaying, stood"
264,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Within the streaming moonlight, till, at last,"
265,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In memory, once more disaster swept"
266,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Over her life, and left her, desolate,"
267,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Upon bleak crags of alien seas unknown.
268,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet, through the tumult of tempestuous dark,"
269,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Above the echo of despairing cries,"
270,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,A calm voice sounded; and beyond the whirl
271,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of foaming death, wherein she caught the gleam"
272,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of well-loved faces drowning in cold seas,"
273,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,A living face shone out--a beacon clear:
274,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then numbing fear fell from her, and she moved,"
275,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Unlatched the door, and stole into the night."
276,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"One moment, dazzled by the full-moon glare,"
277,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She paused, a shivering form within the wide"
278,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And glittering desolation--lone and frail.
279,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But Oswald, watchful on the eastern scars,"
280,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Seeing her, forward came with eager pace"
281,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"To meet her; and, as he drew swiftly near,"
282,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His cowl fell backward; and she knew again
283,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The face that calmed the terrors of her dreams.
284,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet, with the knowledge, through her being stole,"
285,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Vague fear more strange, more impotent than the blind"
286,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Unquestioning dread when death had round her stormed;
287,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,No peril of the body could arouse
288,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Such ecstasy of terror in her soul,"
289,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Which seemed upborne upon the shivering crest
290,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of some great wave, just curving, ere it crash"
291,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Upon the crags of time.  Yet, though she feared"
292,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When Oswald paused, uncertain, quick she spake,"
293,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,As though she sought to parry doom with words.
294,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,She questioned him--scarce heeding his replies--
295,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"How she had hither come; when, suddenly,"
296,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Sped by her fluttering words, the last, dim cloud"
297,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Rolled from her memory, and she saw revealed"
298,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Within a pitiless glare of naked light
299,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The utmost horror of her desolation.
300,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Mute with despair, she stood with parted lips,"
301,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And then cried fiercely: ""Hath the sea upcast"
302,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"None other on this shore?  Am I, alone,"
303,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of all my kin who sailed in that doomed ship,"
304,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Flung back to life?""  And as, with piteous glance,"
305,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He answered her: ""Ah God, that I, with them,"
306,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Had died!  O traitor cords that held too sure
307,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,My body to the broken spar of life!
308,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"O feeble seas, that fumed in such wild wrath,"
309,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet could not quench so frail a thing as I!"""
310,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With passionate step, across the isle she ran,"
311,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And leapt from crag to crag, until she stood"
312,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Upon a dizzy scar that jutted sheer
313,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Above low-lapping waves.  Then once again
314,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Her moaning cry was heard among the Isles:
315,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"""O bitter waters, give them back to me!"
316,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,You shall not keep them; all your waves of woe
317,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Cannot withhold from me those dauntless lives
318,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That were my life.  Surely they cannot rest
319,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Without me; even from your unfathomed graves
320,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Surely my love will draw them to my arms!"""
321,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As though in tremulous expectation tranced,"
322,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She yearned, with arms outstretched; as dawn arose"
323,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Exultant from the sea, and with clear rays"
324,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Kindled her wind-tost hair to streaming flame.
325,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
326,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Awhile she stood, then, moaning, slowly sank"
327,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Upon the crag; and Oswald came to her
328,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With words of comfort which unloosed her pent
329,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And aching woe in swift, tumultuous tears."
330,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Oswald, in silent anguish, drew apart,"
331,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Gazing, unseeing, o’er the dawning waves;"
332,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Until at last the tempest of her grief,"
333,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In low and fitful sobbing, spent itself;"
334,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When, turning to him, once again she spake,"
335,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, shuddering, with faltering voice, outpoured"
336,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The tale of her despair: and Oswald heard
337,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"How she, who sat thus strangely by his side,"
338,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Marna, a sea-earl’s daughter, had besought"
339,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Her father, when the old sea-hunger lit"
340,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His eyes--as waves shot through with stormy fight--
341,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"For leave to bear him company but once,"
342,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When, with his sons, he rode the adventurous seas;"
343,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,How he had yielded with reluctant love;
344,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And how, from out the firth of some far strand,"
345,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Their galley rode, beneath a flaming dawn;"
346,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,How her young heart had leapt to see the sails
347,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Unfurled to take the wind, as, one by one,"
348,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Toil-glistening rowers shipped the dripping oars,"
349,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And loosened every sheet before the breeze;
350,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"How, as the ship with timbers all astrain,"
351,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Leapt to mid-sea, through Marna’s body thrilled"
352,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"A kindred rapture, and there came to her"
353,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The sheer, delirious joy of them true-born"
354,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To wander with the foam--each creaking cord
355,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That tugged the quivering mast unto her singing
356,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of unknown shores and far, enchanted lands,"
357,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Beyond the blue horizon; how, all day,"
358,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"They rode, undaunted, through the spinning surf;"
359,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But, as the sun dipped, in the cold, grey tide,"
360,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The wind, that since the dawn with steady speed"
361,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Had filled the sails, now came in fitful gusts,"
362,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Fierce and yet fiercer, till the sullen waves"
363,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Were lashed to anger, and the waters leapt"
364,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To tussle with the furies of the air;
365,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And how the ship, in the encounter caught,"
366,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Was tossed on crests of swirling dark, or dropped"
367,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Between o’er-toppling walls of whelming night;
368,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,How in those hours--too dread for thought or speech--
369,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Her father’s hand had bound her to a spar;
370,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, even as--the cord between his teeth--"
371,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He tugged the last knot sure, the vessel crashed"
372,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Upon a cleaving scar; and she but saw
373,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The strong, pale faces looking upon death,"
374,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Before the fierce, exultant waters closed"
375,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With cold oblivion o’er them; and no more
376,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She knew, until she waked within the hut,"
377,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"To find her world, in one disastrous night,"
378,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In one swift surge of roaring darkness, swept"
379,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"From her young feet; her kindred, home and friends,"
380,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And all familiar hopes and joys and fears
381,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Dropt like a garment from her life, which now"
382,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Stood naked on the edge of some new world
383,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Of unknown terrors.
384,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Oswald heard her tale
385,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With pitying glance; yet in his eyes arose
386,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"A strange, new light, which as each gust of grief"
387,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Shook out the fluttering words, more brightly burned;"
388,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"So that, when Marna ceased, it seemed to her"
389,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That he, in holy contemplation rapt,"
390,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Had heeded not her woe; and from her heart
391,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Burst out a cry: ""Ah God, I am alone!"""
392,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But, stung by her shrill anguish, Oswald waked"
393,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"From his bright reverie, and his shining eyes"
394,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Darkened with swift compassion, as he turned"
395,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, trembling, spake: ""Nay, not alone..."""
396,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Then mute
397,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,He stood--his pale lips clenched--as though within
398,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,There surged a torrent which he dared not loose.
399,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Marna looked wondering up; but, when her eyes"
400,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Saw the white passion of his face, her soul"
401,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Was tossed once more on crests of unknown fears;
402,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Yet rapture warred with terror in her heart;
403,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She trembled, and her breath came short and quick."
404,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She dared not raise her eyes again to his,"
405,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Till, on her straining ears, his words, once more,"
406,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Fell, slow and cold and clear as water dripping"
407,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Between locked sluice-gates: ""Nothing need you fear."
408,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Beyond the sea of unknown terrors lie
409,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,White havens of an undiscovered peace.
410,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"For even this bleak, scar-embattled coast"
411,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,May yield safe harbour to the storm-spent soul.
412,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Your world has fallen from you that you may
413,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Enter another world, more beautiful,"
414,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Built ’neath the shadow of the throne of God.
415,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"There shall you find new friends, who yet will seem"
416,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Familiar to your eyes, because their souls"
417,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Have passed through kindred perils and despairs."""
418,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He ceased; and silence, trembling, ’twixt them hung;"
419,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Till Marna, gazing yet across the sea,"
420,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Rent it with words: ""Where may I find this peace?"""
421,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And Oswald answered: ""In an inland dale"
422,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The Sisters of the Cross await your coming,"
423,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With ever-open gate.  Within seven days,"
424,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"My brethren from the mainland will put out,"
425,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Bringing me food; on their return with them
426,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"You may embark.  Till then, this barren rock"
427,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Must be your home.""  Exultant light once more"
428,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Leapt, flashing, in the depths of his dark eyes."
429,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet Marna looked not up, but, slowly, spake:"
430,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"""Yea, I must go....  But you...."""
431,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Then in dismay
432,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She stopped, as though the thought had slipped unknown"
433,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"From her full heart; but Oswald caught the words,"
434,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And spake with hard, quick speech, as if to baffle"
435,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Some doubt that strove within him: ""On this Isle"
436,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"I bide, till God shall kindle my weak soul"
437,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"To burn, a beacon o’er His lonely seas."""
438,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Once more he paused; and perilous silence swayed
439,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Between them, until Oswald, quaking, rose,"
440,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,As one who dared no longer rest beneath
441,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"O’er-toppling doom.  Yet, with calm voice, he spake:"
442,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"""Even within this wilderness abides"
443,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Such beauty that, in your brief sojourn here,"
444,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Your soul shall starve not; all about you sweeps
445,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The ever-changing wonder of the sea;
446,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But if, too full of bitter memories,"
447,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The bright waves darken, you may lift your eyes"
448,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To watch the swooping gull; the flashing tern;
449,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The stately cormorant and the kittiwake--
450,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Most beautiful of all the island-birds;
451,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Or, if your woman’s heart should crave some grace"
452,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"More exquisite, see, frail bell-campions blow,"
453,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As foam-flowers on the shallow, sandy turf."""
454,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As thus he spake, a light in Marna’s eyes"
455,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Arose, and sorrow left her for awhile:"
456,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And she with bright glance questioned him, and watched"
457,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The hovering gulls, and plucked the snowy blooms,"
458,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With little cries at each discovered beauty.
459,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet Oswald by her side walked silently,"
460,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And watched, as one struck mute with anguished fear,"
461,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Her eager eyes, and heard her chattering words."
462,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, suddenly, he left her, but returned"
463,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Within the hour, with faltering step, and spake"
464,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With tremulous voice: ""We two must part awhile;"
465,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For I must keep lone vigil in my cell
466,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Six days and nights, with fasting and with prayer;"
467,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Meanwhile, within the little hut for you"
468,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Are food and shelter till the brethren come.
469,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When I must give you over to their care."""
470,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Marna, with wondering heart, looked up at him;"
471,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,But such a wild light flickered in his eyes
472,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She dared not speak; and, shuddering, he turned,"
473,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And strode back swiftly to the hermitage.
474,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
475,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Marna looked after him with yearning gaze,"
476,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As though her heart would have her call him back,"
477,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet her lips moved not; motionless, she watched"
478,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Until he passed from sight; then, sinking low"
479,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Among the flowers, she wept, she knew not why."
480,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
481,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, as the door closed on him, Oswald fell"
482,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Prone on the cold, black, vigil-furrowed rock"
483,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That paved his narrow cell; and long he lay
484,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As in the clutch of some dread waking-trance,"
485,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Nor stirred until the shadows into night
486,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Were woven.  Then unto his feet he leapt
487,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With this wild cry: ""O God, why hast Thou sent"
488,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,This scourge most bitter for my naked soul?
489,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"I feared not storm nor solitude, O God;"
490,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,I shrank not from the tempest of Thy wrath;
491,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Though oft my weak soul wavered, trampled o’er"
492,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"By deedless hours, and yearned unto the world,"
493,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Ever afresh Thy love hath bound me fast
494,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Unto this island of Thy lonely seas;
495,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And I, who deemed that I at last might reach--"
496,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"I who had come through all--Thy golden haven,"
497,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Knew not Thy hand withheld this last despair,"
498,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"This scourge most bitter, being most beautiful."""
499,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then on his knees he sank, and tried to pray"
500,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Before the Virgin’s shrine, where ever burned"
501,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His votive taper with unfailing light.
502,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But when his lips would breathe the holy name,"
503,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"His heart cried: ""Marna!  Marna!""  Every pulse"
504,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Throbbed ""Marna!""  And his body shook and swayed,"
505,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As though it strove to utter that one word,"
506,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And cry it once unto eternal stars,"
507,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Though it should perish crying.  Through the cell
508,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The silence murmured: ""Marna!""  And without"
509,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,A lone gull wailed it to the windy night.
510,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He lifted his wild eyes, and in the shrine"
511,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He saw the face of Marna, which outburned"
512,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The flickering taper; on the gloom up-surged,"
513,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Foam-white, the face of Marna; till the dark"
514,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Flowed pitiful o’er him, and on the stone"
515,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He sank unconscious.  Night went slowly by,"
516,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And pale dawn stole in silence through his cell;
517,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, in the light of morn, the taper died,"
518,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With feeble guttering; yet he never stirred,"
519,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Though noonday waxed and waned.
520,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,But Marna roamed
521,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,All night beneath the stars.  To her it seemed
522,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That not until the closing of the door
523,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Had all hope perished: now death tore, afresh,"
524,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Her father and her brothers from her arms.
525,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,By day and night and under sun and moon
526,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She roamed unresting--seeing, heeding naught--"
527,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Till weariness o’ercame her, and she slept;"
528,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, as she slumbered, snowy-plumed peace"
529,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Nestled within her heart; and, when she waked,"
530,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She only yearned for that dim, cloistral calm,"
531,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Embosomed deep in some bough-sheltered vale,"
532,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Whither the boat must bear her.
533,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In his cell,"
534,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As night paled slowly to the seventh morn,"
535,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Oswald arose--the fire within his eyes
536,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet more intense, more fierce.  With eager hand"
537,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He clutched the latch, and, flinging wide the door,"
538,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"He strode into the dawn.  One moment, dazed,"
539,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As though bewildered by the light, he paused;"
540,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But, when his glance in restless roving fell"
541,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"On Marna, standing on the western crag"
542,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Against the setting moon, beneath the dawn,"
543,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"His passion surged upon him, and he shook;"
544,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, springing madly forth, he, stumbling, ran,"
545,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, falling at her feet upon the rock,"
546,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,His voice rang out in fearful exultation:
547,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"""You shall not go!  I cannot let you go!"
548,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Has not the tumult tossed you to my breast?
549,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yea, and not all the storms of all the seas"
550,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Shall drag you from me!  Nay, you shall not go!"
551,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For we will live together on this isle
552,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Which time has builded in the deeps for us--
553,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"We two together, one in ecstasy,"
554,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Throughout eternity; for time shall fall
555,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,From off us; and the world shall be no more:
556,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And God, if God should stand between us now..."""
557,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Faltering, he paused; and Marna stood, afraid,"
558,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Quaking before him; but she spake no word.
559,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Across the waters came the plash of oars;
560,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"But Oswald heard them not, and once more cried:"
561,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"""You will not go--thrusting me back to death?"
562,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"For now I know the strange, new thing you brought"
563,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"For me from out the storm was life--yea, life;"
564,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And I am one arisen from the grave.
565,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,You will not thrust me back and take again
566,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That which you came through storm to bring to me?
567,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"You will not go?  I cannot let you go!"""
568,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
569,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,He ceased; and now the even plash of oars
570,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Came clearer.  One dread moment Marna stood
571,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Swaying; then, stretching forth her arms, she cried:"
572,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"""Ah God!  Ah God!  Why hath Thy cold hand set"
573,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,This doom upon me?  Must I ever bear
574,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Death and disaster unto whom I love?
575,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Oh, is it not enough that, ’neath the wave,"
576,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Because I sought to bear them company,"
577,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,My father and my brothers lie in death?
578,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,But this--ah God--that it should come to this!
579,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Must I bear ever death within my hands?"""
580,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
581,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She paused one moment, with wild-heaving breast;"
582,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, turning unto Oswald, spake again,"
583,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With softer voice: ""But you--have you no pity?"
584,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,You who are but God’s servant--surely you
585,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Have pity on my weakness.  From this doom
586,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Which overhangs me you must set me free.
587,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,You say I brought you life; but in me lies
588,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For you--the priest of God--a death more deep
589,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Than all the drowning fathoms of the sea.
590,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"I go, that you may live.  If life indeed"
591,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"I brought you, I was but the torch of God"
592,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To kindle the clear flame of your strong soul
593,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"To burn, a beacon o’er His lonely seas."""
594,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She ceased, with arms outstretched and lighted eyes."
595,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,As on some holy vision Oswald gazed
596,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In rapt, adoring fear; nor spake, nor stirred."
597,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Near, and yet nearer, drew the plash of oars;"
598,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And, turning in the boat, the brethren looked"
599,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"With wondering eyes upon them, whispering: ""Lo,"
600,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Some seraph-messenger of God most high
601,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Tarries with Oswald.  See the strange new peace
602,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That burns his face like a white altar-flame.
603,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Not yet must we draw near, lest our weak sight"
604,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Be blinded by that glory of gold hair
605,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"That gleams so strangely in the light of dawn."""

611,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
612,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
613,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,When purple gloomed the wintry ridge
614,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Against the sunset’s windy flame,"
615,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"From pine-browed hills, along the bridge,"
616,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,An unknown rider came.
617,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
618,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,I watched him idly from the tower.
619,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Though he nor looked nor raised his head;
620,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,I felt my life before him cower
621,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"In dumb, foreboding dread."
622,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
623,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,I saw him to the portal win
624,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Unchallenged, and no lackey stirred"
625,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To take his bridle when within
626,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,He strode without a word.
627,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
628,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Through all the house he passed unstayed,"
629,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Until he reached my father’s door;
630,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The hinge shrieked out like one afraid;
631,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Then silence fell once more.
632,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
633,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,All night I hear the chafing ice
634,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Float, griding, down the swollen stream;"
635,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"I lie fast-held in terror’s vice,"
636,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Nor dare to think or dream.
637,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
638,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,I only know the unknown knight
639,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Keeps vigil by my father’s bed:
640,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Oh, who shall wake to see the light"
641,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Flame all the east with red?

647,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
648,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
649,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,_The sleeping-chamber of the King: a candle burns dimly by the curtained
650,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"bed.  The arras parts, and two slaves enter with daggers.  A storm of"
651,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,wind rages without._
652,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
653,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,FIRST SLAVE: He sleeps.
654,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
655,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"SECOND SLAVE: He sleeps, whom only death shall rouse"
656,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To dread unsleeping in another world.
657,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
658,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"FIRST SLAVE: How long the careful night has kept him wakeful,"
659,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,As if sleep loathed to snare him for our knives!
660,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
661,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"SECOND SLAVE: Yea, we have crouched so close in quaking dark"
662,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,I scarce can lift my sword-arm: strike you first.
663,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
664,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,FIRST SLAVE: The heavy waiting hours have crushed my strength;
665,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The hate that burst to such an eager flame
666,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Within my heart has smouldered to dull ash,"
667,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Which pity breathes to scatter.
668,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
669,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,SECOND SLAVE: Knows he pity?
670,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
671,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"FIRST SLAVE: Nay, he is throned above his slaughtered kin,"
672,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"A reeking sword his sceptre.  He has broken,"
673,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As one across the knee a faggot snaps,"
674,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Strong lives to feed the blaze of his ambition;
675,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Yet shall a slave’s hand strike cold death in him
676,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For whom kings sweat like slaves?
677,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
678,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"SECOND SLAVE: Yea, at the stroke"
679,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,One slave lies dead--a hundred kings are born;
680,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For every man that breathes will be a king;
681,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Vast empires, beaten-dust beneath his feet,"
682,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Will rise again and teem with kingly men,"
683,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When he, their death, is dead"
684,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
685,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,FIRST SLAVE: How still he sleeps!
686,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The tempest shrieks to wake him, yet he slumbers."
687,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"As seas that foam against unyielding scars,"
688,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"The mad wind storms the castle, wall and tower,"
689,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And is not spent.  Hark, it has found a breach--"
690,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Some latch unloosed--the house is full of wind;
691,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"It rushes, wailing, down the corridor;"
692,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,It seeks the King; it cries on him to waken;
693,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Now ’tis without, and shakes the rattling bolt;"
694,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Lo, it has broken in, in little gusts,"
695,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,I feel it in my hair; ’twill lay cold fingers
696,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Upon his lips, and start him from his sleep."
697,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"See, it has whipt the yellow flame to smoke."
698,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
699,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"SECOND SLAVE: And now it fails; the heavy, hanging gold"
700,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,That shelters him from night is all unstirred.
701,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
702,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,FIRST SLAVE: Even the wind must pause.
703,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
704,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,SECOND SLAVE: ’Twas but a breeze
705,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,To blow our sinking courage to clear fire.
706,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Too long we loiter; soon the approaching day
707,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Will take us, slaves who grasp the arms of men"
708,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Yet dare not plunge them save in our own breasts.
709,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Come, let us strike!"
710,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
711,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,(_They approach the bed and draw aside the curtain._)
712,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
713,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,FIRST SLAVE: The King--how still he sleeps!
714,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Can majesty in such calm slumber lie?
715,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
716,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"SECOND SLAVE: Come, falter not, strike home!"
717,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
718,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"FIRST SLAVE: Hold, hold your hand,"
719,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,For death has stolen a march upon our hate;
720,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,He does not breathe.
721,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
722,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"SECOND SLAVE: The stars have wrought for us,"
723,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And we are conquerors with unbloodied hands.
724,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
725,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"FIRST SLAVE: Nay, nay, for in our thoughts his life was spilt;"
726,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"While yet our bodies lagged in fettered fear,"
727,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Our shafted breath sped on and stabbed his sleep.
728,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Oh, red for all the world, across our brows,"
729,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Our murderous thoughts have burned the brand of Cain.
730,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"See, through the window stares the pitiless day!"

740,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Where boughs are matted thick o’erhead,"
741,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"There gleams, amid the shadows dread,"
742,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The terror of his armour red;
743,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And all men fear him, high and low;"
744,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Yet all must through the forest go."""
745,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
746,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,She paused awhile where larches flame
747,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,About the borders of the wood;
748,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, crying loud on Love’s high name"
749,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"To keep her maiden-heart from shame,"
750,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She entered, and full-swiftly came"
751,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Where, hooded with a scarlet hood,"
752,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,A rider in her pathway stood.
753,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
754,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,She saw the gleam of armour red;
755,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,She saw the fiery pennon wave
756,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Its flaming terror overhead
757,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,’Mid writhing boughs and shadows dread.

760,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Then, swooning, called on Love to save."
761,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
762,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Among the springing fern she fell,"
763,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And very nigh to death she lay;
764,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Till, like the fading of a spell"
765,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"At ringing of the matin-bell,"
766,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,The darkness left her; by a well
767,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She waked beneath the open day,"
768,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And rose to go upon her way;
769,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
770,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"When, once again, the ruddy light"
771,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"Of arms she saw, and turned to flee;"
772,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,But clutching brambles stayed her flight;
773,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"While, marvelling, she saw the Knight"
774,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,Unhooded; and his eyes were bright
775,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,With April colours of the sea;
776,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,And crowned as a King was he.
777,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,
778,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"She knelt before him in the ferns,"
779,_THE QUEEN’S VIGIL AND OTHER SONG_,"And sang: ""O Lord of Love, I bow"

1580,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1581,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"No cry, no voice in any room,"

1645,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1646,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,I wandered through the city till I came
1647,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Within the vast cathedral, cool and dim;"
1648,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,I looked upon the windows all aflame
1649,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,With blazoned knights and saints and seraphim.
1650,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1651,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"I looked on kings in purple, gold and blue,"
1652,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,On martyrs high before whom all men bow;
1653,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,Until a gleam of light my footsteps drew
1654,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Before a shining seraph, on whose brow"
1655,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1656,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"A little flame, for ever pure and white,"
1657,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,Unwavering burns--the symbol of our love;
1658,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"And as I knelt before him in the night,"
1659,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"He looked, compassionate, on me from above."

1661,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1662,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,9.
1663,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1664,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,I heard a harper ’neath the castle walls
1665,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Sing, for night-shelter in the house of thralls,"
1666,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,A song of hapless lovers; in the shade
1667,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"I paused awhile, unseen of man or maid."
1668,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1669,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Taking his harp, he touched the moaning strings,"
1670,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,And sang of queens unloved and loveless kings;
1671,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,His song shot through my fluttering heart like flame
1672,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Till, wondering, I heard him breathe your name."
1673,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1674,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Oh, then I knew how all the deathless wrong"
1675,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,Time wrought of old is but a harper’s song;
1676,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,And all the hopeless sorrow of long years
1677,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,An idle tale to win a stranger’s tears.
1678,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,
1679,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Yea, in the song of Love’s immortal dead"
1680,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Our love was told; with shuddering heart I fled,"

1692,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"Our barren day-dreams, dream-deserted nights--"
1693,III. QUEEN AVERLAINE.,"That valley-lovers, looking up, might see"

1811,I.,"The knighting-sword fall lightly, and he heard"
1812,I.,The King’s voice bid him rise; and at the word
1813,I.,"He rose, new-flushed with knighthood, swiftly grown"
1814,I.,"To sudden manhood, though, but now, he knelt"
1815,I.,A vigil-wearied squire before the throne.
1816,I.,He paused one moment while the people turned
1817,I.,"To look on him with eyes that kindled bright,"
1818,I.,"Seeing his face aglow with strange, new light;"
1819,I.,"Yet them he saw not where they watched amazed,"
1820,I.,"And, though like azure flames Queen Hild’s eyes burned,"
1821,I.,Beyond the shadow of the throne he gazed
1822,I.,"To where, in kindred rapture, young Christine"
1823,I.,"Stood, tremulous and white, in wind-flower grace--"
1824,I.,"Beneath her thick, dark hair, her happy face"
1825,I.,Pale-gleaming ’midst the ruddy maiden-throng;
1826,I.,"But, following Geoffrey’s eyes, the trembling Queen"
1827,I.,Now bade the harpers rouse the air with song:
1828,I.,From pulsing throat and silver-throbbing string
1829,I.,"The music soared, light-winged, and, fluttering, fell;"
1830,I.,"When, startled as one waking from a spell,"
1831,I.,Geoffrey stepped back among the waiting knights;
1832,I.,While knelt another squire before the King.
1833,I.,"In Queen Hild’s eyes yet hovered stormy lights,"
1834,I.,"Beneath her glooming brows, as waters gleam"
1835,I.,Under snow-laden skies; the summer day
1836,I.,"For her in that brief glance had shivered grey,"
1837,I.,Empty of light and song.  She only heard
1838,I.,The King and knights as people of a dream;
1839,I.,"Yet keenly Geoffrey’s lightest, laughing word"
1840,I.,"Stung to the quick, and stabbed her quivering life,"
1841,I.,Till from each shuddering wound the red joy flowed;
1842,I.,"And, though a ruddy fire on each cheek glowed,"
1843,I.,She felt her drainèd heart within her cold;
1844,I.,Then all at once a hot thought stirred new strife
1845,I.,"Within her breast, and suddenly grown old"
1846,I.,"And wise in treacherous imagining,"
1847,I.,"She pressed her thin lips to a bitter smile,"
1848,I.,And strove with laughing mask to hide the guile
1849,I.,"That, slowly welling, through her body poured"
1850,I.,Cold-blooded life that feels no arrowy sting
1851,I.,"Of joy or hope, nor thrust of pity’s sword."
1852,I.,"To Christine, where she yet enraptured stood,"
1853,I.,"Hild, turning, spake kind words, and coldly praised"
1854,I.,The new-made knight.  Each word Christine amazed
1855,I.,Drank in with joyous heart and eager ears;
1856,I.,To her it seemed ne’er lived a Queen so good;
1857,I.,And love’s swift rapture filled her eyes with tears.
1858,I.,"For her true heart, the day-long pageant moved"
1859,I.,Round Geoffrey’s shining presence; king and knight
1860,I.,"But shone for her with pale, reflected light."
1861,I.,"As trancèd planets circling round the sun,"
1862,I.,About the radiant head of her beloved
1863,I.,The dim throngs moved until the day was done.
1864,I.,"When lucent gold suffused the cloudless west,"
1865,I.,"And lingering thrush-notes failed in drowsy song,"
1866,I.,"She left, at last, the weary maiden-throng,"
1867,I.,To stray alone through dew-hung garden-glades;
1868,I.,And all the love unsealed within her breast
1869,I.,Flowed out from her to light the darkest shades.
1870,I.,Her quivering maiden-body could not hold
1871,I.,The sudden welling of love’s loosened flood;
1872,I.,"Through all her limbs it gushed, and in her blood"
1873,I.,It stormed each throbbing pulse with blissful ache;
1874,I.,"It seemed to spray the utmost glooms with gold,"
1875,I.,And scatter glistening dews in every brake.
1876,I.,While yet she moved in rapture unafraid
1877,I.,"Among the lilies, down the Grey Nun’s Walk,"
1878,I.,"She heard behind the snapping of a stalk,"
1879,I.,"And stayed transfixed, nor dared to turn her head,"
1880,I.,"But stood a solitary, trembling maid--"
1881,I.,"Forlorn and frail, with all her courage fled."
1882,I.,"Thus Geoffrey found her as, hot-foot, he pressed"
1883,I.,To pour about her all the glowing tide
1884,I.,"Day-pent within his heart; the flood-gates wide,"
1885,I.,"His love swept over her, sea after sea,"
1886,I.,"Until life almost swooned within her breast,"
1887,I.,And she seemed like to drown in ecstasy.
1888,I.,"Yet, as the tempest sank in calm at last,"
1889,I.,"She rose from out the foam of love, new-born--"
1890,I.,As Venus from the irised surf of morn--
1891,I.,"To such triumphant beauty, Geoffrey, thralled,"
1892,I.,Before her stood in wonder rooted fast;
1893,I.,Even his love within him bowed appalled
1894,I.,In tongueless worship as he gazed on her;
1895,I.,"While, lily-like, the trancèd flowers among,"
1896,I.,"She stood, love-radiant, and above her hung"
1897,I.,The canopy of star-enkindling night;
1898,I.,"Though, when again she moved with joyous stir,"
1899,I.,He sprang to her in love’s unchallenged might.

1901,I.,
1902,II.,II.
1903,II.,
1904,II.,"All night, beside her slumbering lord, the Queen"
1905,II.,Tossed sleepless--every aching sense astrain
1906,II.,With tingling wakefulness that racked like pain
1907,II.,"Her weary limbs; all night, in wide-eyed dread,"
1908,II.,She watched the slow hours moving dark between
1909,II.,The glimmering window and the curtained bed.
1910,II.,"The fitful calling of the owl, all night,"
1911,II.,Struck like the voice of terror on her ears;
1912,II.,"With brushing wings, about her taloned fears"
1913,II.,"Fluttered till dawn: when, as the summer gloom,"
1914,II.,"Grey-quivering, spilt in silver-showering light,"
1915,II.,"She rose and stood within the dawning room,"
1916,II.,"Shivering and pale--her long, unbraided hair"
1917,II.,Each moment quickening to a livelier gold
1918,II.,"About her snowy shoulders; yet, more cold"
1919,II.,"Than the still gleam of winter-frozen meres,"
1920,II.,"Her blue eyes shone with strange, unseeing stare,"
1921,II.,As though they sought to pierce some mist of fears;
1922,II.,"And, when she turned, the old familiar things"
1923,II.,Unknown and alien seemed to her sight--
1924,II.,Outworn and faded in the morning light
1925,II.,"The rose-embroidered tapestries, and frail"
1926,II.,The painted Love that hung on irised wings
1927,II.,Above the sleeping King.  Dark-browed and pale
1928,II.,"She looked upon her lord, and fresh despair"
1929,II.,"With dreadful calm through all her being stole,"
1930,II.,And froze with icy breath the flickering soul
1931,II.,That strove within her.  Evil courage steeled
1932,II.,"Her heart once more, as, combing back her hair,"
1933,II.,She watched the waking world of wood and field:
1934,II.,Hay-harvesters with long scythes flashing white;
1935,II.,The dewy-browsing deer; the blue smoke-curl
1936,II.,Above some woodland hut; a kerchiefed girl
1937,II.,Driving the kine afield with loitering pace.
1938,II.,"But, as a youthful rider came in sight,"
1939,II.,"She from the casement turned with darkening face,"
1940,II.,"And looked not out again, and fiercely pressed"
1941,II.,"Her white teeth in her quivering underlip,"
1942,II.,To stifle the wild cry that strove to slip
1943,II.,From her strained throat; with clutching hands she sought
1944,II.,To stay the throbbing tumult of her breast
1945,II.,That fluttered like a bird in meshes caught.
1946,II.,
1947,II.,Christine as yet in dreamless slumber lay
1948,II.,Within her turret-chamber; but a bird
1949,II.,Within the laurel singing softly stirred
1950,II.,"Her eyes to wakeful life, and from her bed"
1951,II.,"She rose and stood within the light of day,"
1952,II.,"White-faced and wondering, with lifted head."
1953,II.,"As April-butterflies, new-winged for flight,"
1954,II.,"That poise awhile in quivering amaze,"
1955,II.,"Ere they may dare the unknown, glittering ways"
1956,II.,Of perilous airs--upon the brink of morn
1957,II.,"She paused one moment in the showering light,"
1958,II.,In radiant ecstasy of youth forlorn.
1959,II.,"Then swift remembrance flushed her virgin snow,"
1960,II.,And wakened in her eyes the living fire;
1961,II.,With joyous haste she drew her bright attire
1962,II.,"About her trembling limbs, with eager hands,"
1963,II.,"Veiling her maiden beauty’s morning glow,"
1964,II.,"Before she looked abroad on meadowlands,"
1965,II.,Where Geoffrey rode at dawn.  Across the blaze
1966,II.,"Of dandelions silvering to seed,"
1967,II.,She saw his white horse swing with easy speed;
1968,II.,He rode with head exultant in the breeze
1969,II.,That lifted his brown hair.  With lingering gaze
1970,II.,She watched him vanish down an aisle of trees;
1971,II.,"Then, swiftly gathering her dark hair in braids"
1972,II.,"Above her slender neck, she crossed the floor"
1973,II.,"With noiseless step, unlatched the creaking door,"
1974,II.,"And stole in trembling silence down the stair,"
1975,II.,Intent to reach the garden ere the maids
1976,II.,Should come with chattering tongues and laughter there;
1977,II.,When by her side she heard a rustling stir:
1978,II.,"The arras parted, and before her stood"
1979,II.,"Queen Hild in proud, imperious womanhood,"
1980,II.,"Looking upon her with cold, smiling eyes."
1981,II.,In startled wonder Christine glanced at her.
1982,II.,"Then spake the Queen: ""Do maids thus early rise"
1983,II.,"To tend their household duties, or to feed"
1984,II.,"The doves, relinquishing sleep’s precious hours"
1985,II.,To see the morning dew upon the flowers
1986,II.,And what frail blooms have perished ’neath the moon?
1987,II.,"To reach the Grey Nun’s Walk, mayhap you speed--"
1988,II.,To count the stricken buds of lilies strewn
1989,II.,O’ernight upon the soil by careless feet
1990,II.,"That wandered there so late?  Yea, now I know,"
1991,II.,"Christine, because you flush and tremble so."
1992,II.,Yet look you not on me with eyes that burn;
1993,II.,I would not stay you when you go to greet
1994,II.,The rider of the dawn on his return.
1995,II.,Think you I leave my bed at break of day--
1996,II.,"I, Hild the Queen--to thwart a lover’s kiss?"
1997,II.,"Think you my love of you could stoop to this,"
1998,II.,"Though you would wed a fledgling, deedless Knight?"
1999,II.,"Nay, shrink you not from me, turn not away;"
2000,II.,"Because my heart has never known love’s light,"
2001,II.,"I fain would hear your happy tale of love,"
2002,II.,That I may prosper you and your fair youth.
2003,II.,"Will you not trust me?""  Blind with love’s glad truth,"
2004,II.,Christine sank down within Hild’s outstretched arms.
2005,II.,"Speechless, awhile, with sobbing breath she strove;"
2006,II.,"Then poured out all the tale of love’s alarms,"
2007,II.,"Raptures, despairs, and deathless ecstasies,"
2008,II.,In one quick torrent from her brimming heart;
2009,II.,"Then, quaking, ceased, and drew herself apart,"
2010,II.,Dismayed that she so easily had revealed
2011,II.,"To this white, cold-eyed Queen love’s sanctities."
2012,II.,"Yet Hild moved not, but stood, with hard lips sealed,"
2013,II.,"Until, the chiming of the turret-bell"
2014,II.,"Recalling her, she spake with far-off voice:"
2015,II.,"""I, loveless, in your innocent love rejoice."
2016,II.,May nothing stem its eager raptured course!
2017,II.,"Oh, that my barren heart could love so well,"
2018,II.,And feel the surge of love’s subduing force!
2019,II.,Yet even I from out my dearth may give
2020,II.,"To you, Christine.  Would you that Geoffrey’s name"
2021,II.,"Shall shine, unchallenged, on the lists of fame?"
2022,II.,If you would have him win for you the crown
2023,II.,"Of knightly immortality, and live"
2024,II.,"Triumphant on men’s tongues in high renown,"
2025,II.,"Follow me now.""  With cold, exulting eyes"
2026,II.,"She raised the arras, opening to the light"
2027,II.,An unknown stair-way clambering into night.
2028,II.,Within the caverned wall she swiftly passed.
2029,II.,Christine for one brief moment in surprise
2030,II.,"Uncertain paused; then, wondering, followed fast."
2031,II.,"The falling arras shutting out the day,"
2032,II.,She stumbled blindly through the soaring gloom--
2033,II.,Enclosing dank and chilly as the tomb
2034,II.,Her panting life; and unto her it seemed
2035,II.,"That ever, as she climbed, more sheer the way"
2036,II.,"Before her rose, and ever fainter gleamed"
2037,II.,"The wan, white star of light that overhead"
2038,II.,Hovered remote.  Far up the stair she heard
2039,II.,"A silken rustling as, without a word,"
2040,II.,Relentlessly Queen Hild before her sped
2041,II.,For ever up the ever-soaring steep.
2042,II.,But when it almost seemed that she must fall--
2043,II.,"So loudly in her ears the pulses beat,"
2044,II.,And each step seemed to sink beneath her feet--
2045,II.,"She heard the shrilly grating of a key,"
2046,II.,"And saw, above her, in the unseen wall,"
2047,II.,A dazzling square of day break suddenly.
2048,II.,Within the lighted doorway Queen Hild turned
2049,II.,"To reach a helping hand, and, as she bent"
2050,II.,"To clutch the swooning maiden, well-nigh spent,"
2051,II.,"And drew her to the chamber, weak and faint,"
2052,II.,"Through her gold hair so rare a lustre burned,"
2053,II.,It seemed to Christine that an aureoled saint
2054,II.,Leaned out from heaven to snatch her from the deep.
2055,II.,"Then, dizzily, she sank upon the floor,"
2056,II.,"Dreaming that toil was over evermore,"
2057,II.,And she secure in Love’s celestial fold;
2058,II.,"Till, waking gradually as from a sleep,"
2059,II.,Her dark eyes opened on a blaze of gold.
2060,II.,She sat within a chamber hung around
2061,II.,"With glistering tapestry, whereon a knight,"
2062,II.,"Who bore a golden helm above the fight,"
2063,II.,"For ever triumphed o’er assailing swords,"
2064,II.,"Or led the greenwood chase with horse and hound,"
2065,II.,While far behind him lagged the dames and lords
2066,II.,"And all the hunting train; till he, at length,"
2067,II.,Brought low the antlered quarry on the brink
2068,II.,"Of some deep, craggy cleft, wherefrom did shrink"
2069,II.,The quailing hounds with lathered flanks aquake.
2070,II.,"As Christine looked on them, her maiden-strength"
2071,II.,"Returned to her; and now, more broad awake,"
2072,II.,"She saw, within the centre of the room,"
2073,II.,A golden table whereon glittered bright
2074,II.,"A casket of wrought gold, and, in the light,"
2075,II.,"Queen Hild, awaiting her, with smiling lips,"
2076,II.,"And laughing words: ""Is this then love’s sad doom,"
2077,II.,"To perish, fainting, in light’s brief eclipse"
2078,II.,Between a curtain and a closed door?
2079,II.,"Shall this bright casket ever hold, unsought,"
2080,II.,The golden helm--in elfin-ages wrought
2081,II.,For some star-destined knight--because love’s heart
2082,II.,Grows faint within her?  Shall the world no more
2083,II.,"Acclaim its helmèd lord?""  But, with a start,"
2084,II.,"Christine arose, and swiftly forward came"
2085,II.,"With eager eyes, and stooped with fluttering breast--"
2086,II.,"Her slender, shapely hands together pressed"
2087,II.,"In tense expectancy, and all her face"
2088,II.,With quivering light of wondering love aflame.
2089,II.,"The Queen bent down, and in a breathing space"
2090,II.,"Unlocked the casket with a golden key,"
2091,II.,And deftly loosed a little golden pin;
2092,II.,"The heavy lid swung open and, within,"
2093,II.,To Christine’s eyes revealed the golden helm.
2094,II.,"Then spake Queen Hild, once more: ""Your love-gift see!"
2095,II.,Think you that any smith in all the realm
2096,II.,Can beat dull metal to so fair a casque?
2097,II.,In jewelled caverns of enchantment old
2098,II.,This helm was wrought of magic-tempered gold
2099,II.,"To yieldless strength, by elfin-hammers chased,"
2100,II.,"That toiled unwearied at their age-long task,"
2101,II.,And over it an unknown legend traced
2102,II.,In letters of some world-forgotten tongue.
2103,II.,"At noon, with careful footing, down the stair"
2104,II.,"Unto the hall the casket you must bear,"
2105,II.,"When King and knight are gathered round the board,"
2106,II.,"And, ere the tales be told or songs be sung,"
2107,II.,"Acclaim your love the golden-helmed lord."""
2108,II.,"Christine, awhile, in speechless wonderment,"
2109,II.,"Hung o’er the glistering helm, and silence fell"
2110,II.,Within the arrased chamber like a spell;
2111,II.,"While softly, on some distant, sunlit roof,"
2112,II.,The basking pigeons cooed with deep content;
2113,II.,"Till, far below, a sudden-clanging hoof"
2114,II.,Startled the morn.  The women’s lifted eyes
2115,II.,One moment met in kindred ecstasy;
2116,II.,"Then Hild, with hopeless shudder, shaking free,"
2117,II.,"With strained voice spake: ""Why do you longer wait?"
2118,II.,"Your love returns; shall he, in sad surprise,"
2119,II.,"Find no glad face to greet him at the gate?"""
2120,II.,
2121,II.,
2122,III.,III.
2123,III.,
2124,III.,"As some new jest was tossed from tongue to tongue,"
2125,III.,"Light laughter rippled round the midday board,"
2126,III.,Beneath the bannered rafters: dame and lord
2127,III.,And maid and squire with merry chattering
2128,III.,Sat feasting; though no motley humour wrung
2129,III.,"A smile from Hild, where she, beside the King,"
2130,III.,Watched pale and still.  She saw on Geoffrey’s face
2131,III.,Grave wonder that he caught not anywhere
2132,III.,"Among the maids the dusk of Christine’s hair,"
2133,III.,"Or sunlight of her glance.  His eyes, between"
2134,III.,"The curtained doorway and her empty place,"
2135,III.,"Kept eager, anxious vigil for Christine."
2136,III.,"But when, at last, the lingering meal nigh o’er,"
2137,III.,"The waking harp-notes trembled through the hush,"
2138,III.,"Like the light, fitful prelude of the thrush"
2139,III.,Ere his full song enchant the domèd elm;
2140,III.,"The arras parting, through the open door"
2141,III.,"She came.  Before her borne, the golden helm"
2142,III.,"Within the dim-lit hall shone out so bright,"
2143,III.,"That lord and dame in rustling wonder rose,"
2144,III.,"And squire and maiden sought to gather close,"
2145,III.,"With questioning lips, about the love-bright maid."
2146,III.,"Christine, unheeding, turned nor left nor right;"
2147,III.,"With lifted head and eager step unstayed,"
2148,III.,"She strode to Geoffrey, while he stood alone,"
2149,III.,Radiant with wondering love--as one who sees
2150,III.,"The light of high, eternal mysteries"
2151,III.,Illume awhile the mortal shade that moves
2152,III.,"From out oblivion unto night unknown,"
2153,III.,Hugging a little grace of joys and loves.
2154,III.,"Before him now she came and, kneeling, spake,"
2155,III.,"With slow, clear-welling voice: ""In ages old"
2156,III.,"This helm was wrought from elfin-hammered gold,"
2157,III.,"For one who, in the after-days, should be"
2158,III.,"Supreme above his kind, as, in the brake"
2159,III.,"Of branching fern, the solitary tree"
2160,III.,That crests the fell-top.  Unto you I bring
2161,III.,"The gift of destiny, that, as the sun"
2162,III.,"New-risen of your knighthood, newly-won,"
2163,III.,"The wondering world may see its glory shine."""
2164,III.,"As Christine spake, with questioning glance the King"
2165,III.,"Turned to the Queen, who gave no answering sign."
2166,III.,"Then, stretching forth his arm, he cried: ""Sir knight,"
2167,III.,I know not by what evil chance this maid
2168,III.,Has climbed the secret newell-stair unstayed
2169,III.,"And reached the casket-chamber, and has borne"
2170,III.,"From thence the Helm of Strife, whereon the light"
2171,III.,"Of day has never fallen, night or morn,"
2172,III.,"For seven hundred years; but, ere you take"
2173,III.,"The doomful gift, know this: he who shall dare"
2174,III.,To don the golden helm must ever fare
2175,III.,"Upon the edge of peril, ever ride"
2176,III.,"Between dark-ambushed dangers, ever wake"
2177,III.,Unto the thunderous crash of battle-tide.
2178,III.,"Oh, pause before you take the fateful helm."
2179,III.,"Will you, so young, forego, for evermore,"
2180,III.,"The sheltered haven-raptures of the shore,"
2181,III.,"To strive in ceaseless tempest, till, at last,"
2182,III.,The fury-crested wave shall overwhelm
2183,III.,"Your broken life on death’s dark crag upcast?"""
2184,III.,"He ceased, and stood with eyes of hot appeal;"
2185,III.,An aching silence shuddered through the hall;
2186,III.,"None stirred nor spake, though, swaying like to fall,"
2187,III.,"Christine, in mute, imploring agony,"
2188,III.,Wavered nigh death.  As glittering points of steel
2189,III.,Queen Hild’s eyes gleamed in bitter victory.
2190,III.,"But all were turned to Geoffrey, where he stood"
2191,III.,"In pillared might of manhood, very fair;"
2192,III.,"His face a little paled beneath his hair,"
2193,III.,Though bright his eyes with all the light of day.
2194,III.,"At length he spake: ""For evil or for good,"
2195,III.,"I take the Helm of Strife; let come what may."""
2196,III.,
2197,III.,
2198,IV.,IV.
2199,IV.,
2200,IV.,Dawn shivered coldly through the meadowlands;
2201,IV.,The ever-trembling aspens by the stream
2202,IV.,Quivered with chilly light and fitful gleam;
2203,IV.,"Ruffling the heavy foliage of the plane,"
2204,IV.,"Until the leaves turned, like pale, lifted hands,"
2205,IV.,A cold gust stirred with presage of near rain.
2206,IV.,Coldly the light on Geoffrey’s hauberk fell;
2207,IV.,But yet more cold on Christine’s heart there lay
2208,IV.,"The winter-clutch of grief, as, far away,"
2209,IV.,"She saw him ride, and in the stirrup rise"
2210,IV.,"And, turning, wave to her a last farewell."
2211,IV.,"Beyond the ridge he vanished, and her eyes"
2212,IV.,Caught the far flashing of the helm of gold
2213,IV.,One moment as it glanced with mocking light;
2214,IV.,Then naught but tossing pine-trees filled her sight.
2215,IV.,Yet darker gloomed the woodlands ’neath the drench
2216,IV.,Of pillared showers; colder and yet more cold
2217,IV.,"Her heart had shuddered since the last, hot wrench"
2218,IV.,Of parting overnight.  Though still her mouth
2219,IV.,Felt the mute impress of love’s sacred seal;
2220,IV.,Though still through all her senses seemed to steal
2221,IV.,The heavy fume of wound-wort that had hung
2222,IV.,All night about the hedgerows--parched with drouth;
2223,IV.,"Though the first notes the missel-cock had sung,"
2224,IV.,"Ere darkness fled, resounded in her ears;"
2225,IV.,Yet no hot tempest of tumultuous woe
2226,IV.,Shook her young body.  As night-fallen snow
2227,IV.,"Burdens with numb despair young April’s green,"
2228,IV.,Her sorrow lay upon her; hopes and fears
2229,IV.,Within her slept.  As something vaguely seen
2230,IV.,Nor realised--since yesterday’s dread noon
2231,IV.,Had shattered all love’s triumph--life had passed
2232,IV.,About her like a dream by doom o’ercast.
2233,IV.,"Long hours she sat, with silent, folded hands,"
2234,IV.,And face that glimmered like a winter moon
2235,IV.,In cloudy hair.  Across the rain-grey lands
2236,IV.,She gazed with eyes unseeing; till she heard
2237,IV.,"A step within her chamber, and her name"
2238,IV.,Fell dully on her ear; then like a flame
2239,IV.,Sharp anguish shot through every aching limb
2240,IV.,"With keen remembrance.  Suddenly she stirred,"
2241,IV.,"And, turning, looked on Hild.  ""Grieve you for him..."""
2242,IV.,"The Queen began; then, with a little gasp,"
2243,IV.,"Her voice failed, and she shrank before the gaze"
2244,IV.,"Of Christine’s eyes, and, shrivelled by the blaze"
2245,IV.,"Of fires her hand had kindled, all her pride"
2246,IV.,"Fell shredded, and not even the gold clasp"
2247,IV.,"Of queenhood held, her naked deed to hide."
2248,IV.,"She quailed, and, turning, fled from out the room."
2249,IV.,"Soon Christine’s wrath was drowned in whelming grief,"
2250,IV.,And in the fall of tears she found relief--
2251,IV.,As brooding skies in sweet release of rain.
2252,IV.,"All day she wept, until, at length, the gloom"
2253,IV.,Of eve laid soothing hands upon her pain.
2254,IV.,"Then, once again, she rose, calm-browed, and sped"
2255,IV.,"Downstairs with silent step, and reached, unstayed,"
2256,IV.,"The Grey Nun’s Walk, where all alone a maid"
2257,IV.,"Drank in the rain-cooled air.  With low-breathed words,"
2258,IV.,"They whispered long together, while, o’erhead,"
2259,IV.,From rain-wet branches rang the song of birds.
2260,IV.,The maiden often paused as in alarm;
2261,IV.,"Then, with uncertain, half-delaying pace,"
2262,IV.,"She left Christine, returning in a space"
2263,IV.,"With Philip, Christine’s brother, a young squire,"
2264,IV.,"Who strode by her with careless, swinging arm"
2265,IV.,"And eager face, with keen, blue eyes afire."
2266,IV.,"Then all three stood, with whispering heads bent low,"
2267,IV.,"In eager converse clustered; till, at last,"
2268,IV.,"They parted, and, with high hopes beating fast,"
2269,IV.,Christine unto her turret-room returned--
2270,IV.,"Her dark eyes bright and all her face aglow,"
2271,IV.,As if some new-lit rapture in her burned.
2272,IV.,"About her little chamber swift she moved,"
2273,IV.,"Until, at length, in travelling array,"
2274,IV.,"She paused to rest, and all-impatient lay"
2275,IV.,"Upon her snow-white bed, and watched the light"
2276,IV.,Fail from the lilied arras that she loved
2277,IV.,Because her hand had wrought each petal white
2278,IV.,"And slender, emerald stem.  The falling night"
2279,IV.,Was lit for her with many a memory
2280,IV.,"Of little things she could no longer see,"
2281,IV.,"That had been with her in old, happy hours,"
2282,IV.,Before her girlish joys had taken flight
2283,IV.,As morning dews from noon-unfolding flowers.
2284,IV.,"For her, with laggard pace the minutes trailed,"
2285,IV.,Till night seemed to eternity outdrawn.
2286,IV.,"At last, an hour before the summer-dawn,"
2287,IV.,"She rose and once again, with noiseless tread,"
2288,IV.,"Crept down the stair, grey-cloaked and closely veiled,"
2289,IV.,While every shadow struck her cold with dread
2290,IV.,"Lest, drawing back the arras, Hild should stand"
2291,IV.,"With mocking smile before her; but, unstayed,"
2292,IV.,"She reached the stair-foot, and, no more afraid,"
2293,IV.,"She sought a low and shadow-hidden door,"
2294,IV.,"Slid back the silent bolts with eager hand,"
2295,IV.,And stepped into the garden dim once more.
2296,IV.,"She quickly crossed a dewy-plashing lawn,"
2297,IV.,"And, passing through a little wicket-gate,"
2298,IV.,She reached the road.  Not long had she to wait
2299,IV.,"Ere, with two bridled horses, Philip came."
2300,IV.,Silent they mounted; far they fared ere dawn
2301,IV.,Burnished the castle-weathercock to flame.
2302,IV.,
2303,IV.,
2304,V.,V.
2305,V.,
2306,V.,Northward they climbed from out the valley mist;
2307,V.,Northward they crossed the sun-enchanted fells;
2308,V.,"Northward they plunged down deep, fern-hidden dells;"
2309,V.,And northward yet--until the sapphire noon
2310,V.,Had burned and glowed to thunderous amethyst
2311,V.,Of evening skies about an opal moon;
2312,V.,Northward they followed fast the loud-tongued fame
2313,V.,Of young Sir Geoffrey of the golden helm;
2314,V.,Until it seemed that storm must overwhelm
2315,V.,"Their weary flight.  They sought a lodging-place,"
2316,V.,And soon upon a lonely cell they came
2317,V.,Wherein a hermit laboured after grace.
2318,V.,"On beds of withered bracken, soft and warm,"
2319,V.,"He housed them, and himself, all night, alone,"
2320,V.,"Knelt in long vigil on the aching stone,"
2321,V.,"Within his little chapel, though, all night,"
2322,V.,"His prayers were drowned by thunders of the storm,"
2323,V.,"And all about him flashed blue, pulsing light."
2324,V.,"Christine in calm, undreaming slumber lay,"
2325,V.,"Nor stirred till, clear and glittering, the morn"
2326,V.,"Sang through the forest; though, with roots uptorn,"
2327,V.,The mightiest-limbed and highest-soaring oak
2328,V.,"Had fallen charred, with green leaves shrivelled grey."
2329,V.,"At tinkling of the matin-bell she woke,"
2330,V.,And soon with Philip left the woodland boughs
2331,V.,For barer uplands.  Over tawny bent
2332,V.,And purpling heath they rode till day was spent;
2333,V.,"When, down within a broad, green-dusking dale,"
2334,V.,They sought the shelter of the holy house
2335,V.,Of God’s White Sisters of the Virgin’s Veil.
2336,V.,"So, day by day, they ever northward pressed,"
2337,V.,"Until they left the lands of peace behind,"
2338,V.,"And rode among the border-hills, where blind"
2339,V.,Insatiate warfare ever rages fierce;
2340,V.,"Where night-winds ever fan a fiery crest,"
2341,V.,"And dawn’s light breaks on bright, embattled spears:"
2342,V.,A land whose barren hills are helmed with towers;
2343,V.,"A lone, grey land of battle-wasted shires;"
2344,V.,A land of blackened barns and empty byres;
2345,V.,"A land of rock-bound holds and robber-hordes,"
2346,V.,"Of slumberous noons and wakeful midnight hours,"
2347,V.,Of ambushed dark and moonlight flashing swords.
2348,V.,"With hand on hilt and ever-kindling eyes,"
2349,V.,"Flushed face and quivering nostril, Philip rode;"
2350,V.,But nought assailed them; every lone abode
2351,V.,Forsaken seemed; all empty lay the land
2352,V.,Beneath the empty sky; only the cries
2353,V.,Of plovers pierced the blue on either hand;
2354,V.,"Until, at sudden cresting of a hill,"
2355,V.,"The clang of battle sounded on their ears,"
2356,V.,"And, far below, they saw a surge of spears"
2357,V.,"Crash on unyielding ranks; while, from the sea"
2358,V.,"Of striving steel, with deathly singing shrill,"
2359,V.,A spray of arrows flickered fitfully.
2360,V.,"Amazed they stood, wide-eyed, with holden breath;"
2361,V.,"When, of a sudden, flashed upon their sight"
2362,V.,"The golden helm in midmost of the fight,"
2363,V.,"Where, with high-lifted head and undismayed,"
2364,V.,"Sir Geoffrey rode, a very lord of death,"
2365,V.,"With ever-leaping, ever-crashing blade."
2366,V.,"Christine watched long, now cold with quaking dread,"
2367,V.,Now hot with hope as each assailant fell;
2368,V.,The bright sword held her gaze as by a spell;
2369,V.,"Because love blinded her to all but love,"
2370,V.,"Unmoved she watched the foemen shudder dead,"
2371,V.,She whose heart erst the meanest woe could move.
2372,V.,"Then, dazed, she saw a solitary shaft,"
2373,V.,"Unloosed with certain aim from out the bow,"
2374,V.,"Strike clean through Geoffrey’s hauberk, and bring low"
2375,V.,"The golden helm, while o’er him swiftly met"
2376,V.,The tides of fight.  Christine a little laughed
2377,V.,"With rattling throat, and stood with still eyes set."
2378,V.,Scarce Philip dared to raise his eyes to hers
2379,V.,"To see the terror there.  No word she spake,"
2380,V.,But leaned a little forward through the brake
2381,V.,That bloomed about her in a golden blaze;
2382,V.,"Her hands were torn to bleeding by the furze,"
2383,V.,Yet nothing could disturb that dreadful gaze.
2384,V.,"Then, gradually, the heaving battle swerved"
2385,V.,"To northward, faltering broken, and afar"
2386,V.,"It closed again, where, round a jutting scar,"
2387,V.,The flashing torrent of the river curved.
2388,V.,"With eager step Christine ran down the hill,"
2389,V.,And sped across the late-forsaken field
2390,V.,"To where, with shattered sword and splintered shield,"
2391,V.,Among the mounded bodies Geoffrey lay.
2392,V.,"She loosed his helm, but deathly pale and still"
2393,V.,His young face gleamed within the light of day.
2394,V.,"Christine beside him knelt, as Philip sought"
2395,V.,A draught of water from the peat-born stream;
2396,V.,"When, in his eyes, at last, a fitful gleam"
2397,V.,"Flickered, and bending low, with straining ears,"
2398,V.,The laboured breathing of her name she caught;
2399,V.,And over his dead face fell fast her tears.
2400,V.,Once more towards them the tide of battle swept;
2401,V.,"Christine moved not.  Young Philip on her cried,"
2402,V.,"And strove, in vain, to draw her safe aside."
2403,V.,A random shaft in her unshielded breast--
2404,V.,Though hot to stay its course her brother leapt--
2405,V.,"Struck quivering, and she slowly sank to rest."
2406,V.,
2407,V.,
2408,VI.,VI.
2409,VI.,
2410,VI.,"Queen Hild sat weaving in her garden-close,"
2411,VI.,When on her startled ear there fell the news
2412,VI.,Of Christine’s flight before the darkling dews
2413,VI.,Had thrilled with dawn.  A strand of golden thread
2414,VI.,Slipped from her trembling fingers as she rose
2415,VI.,And hastened to the castle with drooped head.
2416,VI.,"All morn she paced within her blinded room,"
2417,VI.,"Unresting, to and fro, her white hands clenched;"
2418,VI.,"All morn within her tearless eyes, unquenched,"
2419,VI.,"Blue fires of anger smouldered, yet no moan"
2420,VI.,"Escaped her lips.  Without, in summer bloom,"
2421,VI.,The garden murmured with bliss-burdened drone
2422,VI.,Of hover-flies and lily-charmed bees;
2423,VI.,"Sometimes a finch lit on the window-ledge,"
2424,VI.,"With shrilly pipe, or, from the rose-hung hedge,"
2425,VI.,A blackbird fluted; yet she neither heard
2426,VI.,"Nor heeded aught; until, by rich degrees,"
2427,VI.,Drowsed into noon the noise of bee and bird.
2428,VI.,"Yea, even when, without her chamber, stayed"
2429,VI.,"A doubtful step, and timid fingers knocked,"
2430,VI.,"She answered not, but, swiftly striding, locked"
2431,VI.,"Yet more secure, with angry-clicking key,"
2432,VI.,"The bolted door, and the affrighted maid"
2433,VI.,"Unto the waiting hall fled, fearfully."
2434,VI.,"Wearied at last, upon her bed Queen Hild"
2435,VI.,In fitful slumber sank; but evil dreams
2436,VI.,Of battle-stricken lands and blood-red streams
2437,VI.,"Swirled through her brain.  Then, suddenly, she woke,"
2438,VI.,"Wide-eyed, and sat upright, with body chilled,"
2439,VI.,Though in her throat the hot air seemed to choke.
2440,VI.,"Swiftly she rose; then, binding her loosed hair,"
2441,VI.,"She bathed her throbbing brows, and, cold and calm,"
2442,VI.,"Downstairs she glided, while the evening-psalm"
2443,VI.,"In maiden-voices quavered, faint and sweet,"
2444,VI.,"And from the chapel-tower, through quivering air,"
2445,VI.,The bell’s clear silver-tinkling clove the heat.
2446,VI.,She strode into the hall where yet the King
2447,VI.,Sat with his knights; a weary minstrel stirred
2448,VI.,"Cool, throbbing wood-notes, throated like a bird,"
2449,VI.,From his soft-stringèd lute.  With scornful eyes
2450,VI.,"Hild looked on them and spake: ""Can nothing sting"
2451,VI.,Your slumberous hearts from slothful peace to rise?
2452,VI.,Must only stripling-knights and maidens ride
2453,VI.,"To battle, where, unceasing, foemen wage"
2454,VI.,"War on your marches, and your wardens rage"
2455,VI.,"In impotent despair with desperate swords,"
2456,VI.,"While you, O King, with sheathèd arms abide?"""
2457,VI.,"She paused, and, wondering, the King and lords"
2458,VI.,"Looked on her mutely; then, again, she spake:"
2459,VI.,"""Shall I, then, and my maidens sally forth"
2460,VI.,With battle-brands to conquer the wild north?
2461,VI.,"Yea, I will go!  Who follows after me?"""
2462,VI.,"As by a blow struck suddenly awake,"
2463,VI.,"The King leapt up, and, like a clamorous sea,"
2464,VI.,The knights about him.  Scornfully the Queen
2465,VI.,"Looked on them: ""So my woman’s words have roused"
2466,VI.,The hands that slumbered and the hearts that drowsed.
2467,VI.,Make ready then for battle; ere seven days
2468,VI.,"Have passed, the dawn must light your armour’s sheen,"
2469,VI.,"And in the sun your pennoned lances blaze."""
2470,VI.,Her voice ceased; and a pulsing flame of light
2471,VI.,Flashed through the hall; in crashing thunder broke
2472,VI.,"The heavy, hanging heat; the rafters woke"
2473,VI.,In echo as the rainy torrent poured;
2474,VI.,Bright gleamed the rapid lightning; yet more bright
2475,VI.,The war-lust kindled hot in every lord.
2476,VI.,To clang of armour the seventh morning stirred
2477,VI.,From slumber; restless hoof and champing bit
2478,VI.,"Aroused the garth; and day, arising, lit"
2479,VI.,"A hundred lances, as, each bolt withdrawn,"
2480,VI.,"The courtyard-gate swung wide with noise far-heard,"
2481,VI.,And flickering pennons rode into the dawn--
2482,VI.,"Before his knights, the King, and at his side,"
2483,VI.,"Queen Hild, with ever-northward-gazing eyes;"
2484,VI.,"But, ere they far had fared, in mute surprise"
2485,VI.,"They stayed and all drew rein, as down the road"
2486,VI.,They saw a little band of warriors ride--
2487,VI.,Sore travel-stained--who bore a heavy load
2488,VI.,Upon a branch-hung litter; while before
2489,VI.,"Came Philip, bearing a war-broken lance."
2490,VI.,"Though King and lords looked, wondering, in a glance"
2491,VI.,Queen Hild had read the sorrow of his face
2492,VI.,And pierced the leaf-hid secret--which e’ermore
2493,VI.,A brand of fire upon her heart would trace.
2494,VI.,"Darkness about her swirled, but, with a fierce"
2495,VI.,"Wild, conquering shudder, shaking herself free,"
2496,VI.,"Unto the light she clung, though like a sea"
2497,VI.,It surged and eddied round her; yet so still
2498,VI.,"She sat, none knew her steely eyes could pierce"
2499,VI.,"The leafy screen.  With guilty terror chill,"
2500,VI.,She heard the king speak--sadly riding forth:
2501,VI.,"""Whence come you, Philip, battle-stained and slow?"
2502,VI.,"What burden bear you with such brows of woe?"""
2503,VI.,"Then Philip answered, mournfully: ""I bring"
2504,VI.,Two wanderers home from out the perilous north.
2505,VI.,"Prepare to gaze on death’s defeat, O King."""
2506,VI.,They lowered the litter slowly to the ground;
2507,VI.,"Back fell the branches; in the light of day,"
2508,VI.,"In calm, white sleep Christine and Geoffrey lay,"
2509,VI.,And at their feet the baleful Helm of Strife
2510,VI.,"Sword-cloven.  Hushed stood all the knights around,"
2511,VI.,"When spake the King, alighting: ""Come, O wife,"
2512,VI.,"And let us twain, with humble heads low-bowed,"
2513,VI.,"Even at the feet of love triumphant stand,"
2514,VI.,"A little while together, hand in hand."""
2515,VI.,"The Queen obeyed; but, fearfully, she shrank"
2516,VI.,"Before the eyes of death, and, quaking, cowed,"
2517,VI.,"With moaning cry, low in the dust she sank."
