140,_THRASEA._,
141,_THRASEA._,"IF you ask my advice then, it is silence. You are"
142,_THRASEA._,"yet new to the senate, and must learn to give"
143,_THRASEA._,your opinion with least offence.
144,_THRASEA._,
145,_PRISCUS._,_PRISCUS._
146,_PRISCUS._,
147,_PRISCUS._,Can you mean this?
148,_PRISCUS._,
149,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ Yes—it is my serious advice.
150,_PRISCUS._,
151,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._ Now, unless it were the silence of Brutus ..."
152,_PRISCUS._,
153,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._ Hush, hush! Were this repeated, there is no"
154,_PRISCUS._,greater peril than that word of yours.
155,_PRISCUS._,
156,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ But to you I know I may speak freely.
157,_PRISCUS._,
158,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ What know you of me?                                         10
159,_PRISCUS._,
160,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._ I know Thrasea is brave, and resents his country’s"
161,_PRISCUS._,wrongs; that he has insight to see that liberty
162,_PRISCUS._,was never more outraged than now.
163,_PRISCUS._,
164,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._ Believe me, sir, this tale of things being at their"
165,_PRISCUS._,worst is common to all times. Your judgment has gone
166,_PRISCUS._,"astray upon a contempt for Cæsar’s follies, or a hatred"
167,_PRISCUS._,of his mother’s crimes. Measure Nero but by what he
168,_PRISCUS._,"has already done, and you may even find cause for"
169,_PRISCUS._,congratulation.                                                       19
170,_PRISCUS._,
171,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ We shall be ruled like the Britons by a Queen.
172,_PRISCUS._,
173,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ O nay. It is not possible that Nero will suffer
174,_PRISCUS._,Agrippina’s ambition to take such a place. ’Tis already
175,_PRISCUS._,"a quarrel between them, and Seneca declares for him."
176,_PRISCUS._,
177,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._ Then, I ask you, may there not be found in this"
178,_PRISCUS._,quarrel an opportunity to bring in Britannicus? Now
179,_PRISCUS._,"he is of age, he can no longer be held disqualified."
180,_PRISCUS._,
181,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ There is no question of qualification or of
182,_PRISCUS._,claim.                                                                28
183,_PRISCUS._,
184,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ How so? The late emperor Claudius in his will
185,_PRISCUS._,"mentioned Britannicus for his successor, as being his"
186,_PRISCUS._,own son....
187,_PRISCUS._,
188,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._ May be. But then, sir, his empress made away"
189,_PRISCUS._,with both him and his will; and the Roman people chose
190,_PRISCUS._,"for Cæsar the son of the murderess, rather than the heir"
191,_PRISCUS._,of the idiot they were glad to be rid of. Since which
192,_PRISCUS._,day Nero is as truly our Cæsar as Britannicus could
193,_PRISCUS._,ever have been. Those who swore to Nero will remain
194,_PRISCUS._,"by him; as ’tis well they should, else were no stability."
195,_PRISCUS._,
196,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ Shall we then do nothing?                                     39
197,_PRISCUS._,
198,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ You take things by the wrong handle. Let us
199,_PRISCUS._,make the best of what we have. Our Cæsar is the pupil
200,_PRISCUS._,of a philosopher and guided in everything by his
201,_PRISCUS._,master’s counsels.
202,_PRISCUS._,
203,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ You are very tolerant and hopeful.
204,_PRISCUS._,
205,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._ Try and be so too, and I shall wish to see"
206,_PRISCUS._,"more of you. If you will visit my house, you will indeed"
207,_PRISCUS._,be most welcome and may find congenial company.
208,_PRISCUS._,Only no more of Brutus.
209,_PRISCUS._,
210,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._ Thank you for your kindness, if it is an earnest"
211,_PRISCUS._,of your confidence—On another occasion...                            50
212,_PRISCUS._,
213,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ O we will find many. (_Shouts heard._) What is
214,_PRISCUS._,that? (_More shouts._) It must be Cæsar: he is coming
215,_PRISCUS._,this way. Be not seen talking with me: go you that
216,_PRISCUS._,way: I will remain. Farewell.
217,_PRISCUS._,
218,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._ Farewell, Thrasea. [_Exit._"
219,_PRISCUS._,
220,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._ Young blood, hot blood and true:"
221,_PRISCUS._,Yet is his energetic patriotism
222,_PRISCUS._,"Useless,—nay, like a weapon out of date,"
223,_PRISCUS._,Looks not to be a warlike weapon more.
224,_PRISCUS._,"I think in me it had been truer wisdom,                           60"
225,_PRISCUS._,"Knowing the forces of this drowning time,"
226,_PRISCUS._,"To have said outright—Good, honest Priscus,"
227,_PRISCUS._,"Be good no longer, let thine honesty"
228,_PRISCUS._,"Rot, it can stead thee nothing; there’s no man"
229,_PRISCUS._,Will be the better for it; there’s no field
230,_PRISCUS._,"Where thou canst exercise it, not a place"
231,_PRISCUS._,In all the world where in secure possession
232,_PRISCUS._,Thou mayst retire with it: cast it away;
233,_PRISCUS._,For ’tis a burden far beyond thy freight.
234,_PRISCUS._,"If thou wilt swim at all, swim with the times,                    70"
235,_PRISCUS._,An empty bottom on a shallow tide:
236,_PRISCUS._,Be that thy seamanship—No; I am bold to say
237,_PRISCUS._,Our virtue hath the topmost vaunt of honour;
238,_PRISCUS._,"Seeing we are true to it in spite of shame,"
239,_PRISCUS._,When its incompetence before the world
240,_PRISCUS._,"Gives it the lie; nor can the fawning curs,"
241,_PRISCUS._,"That bask in Cæsar’s sunshine, when they mock us,"
242,_PRISCUS._,Dream that we wish them other than they are.
243,_PRISCUS._,"I give them joy. See here is folly’s king,"
244,_PRISCUS._,The hare-brained boy to whom injurious fortune                    80
245,_PRISCUS._,Has given the throne and grandeur of the world:
246,_PRISCUS._,"Now if I bow my head ’tis in thy game,"
247,_PRISCUS._,Ridiculous fate; and my soul laughs at thee.
248,_PRISCUS._,
249,_PRISCUS._,[_Retires aside._
250,_PRISCUS._,
251,_PRISCUS._,"_Enter Nero, Otho, Lucan, Tigellinus, and Paris._"

253,_NERO._,_NERO._
254,_NERO._,
255,_NERO._,This is the place: enlarge it on this side
256,_NERO._,To take in all the hill. That house of Rufus
257,_NERO._,"That blocks the way must down, and all the piles"
258,_NERO._,"On the south slope. Now say, is’t fine or no?"

270,_TIGELLINUS._,Splendid.
271,_TIGELLINUS._,
272,_TIGELLINUS._,_Ner._    At least the best: we still regret
273,_TIGELLINUS._,A better than the best; and I can see                             90
274,_TIGELLINUS._,These possibilities. Think if the hill
275,_TIGELLINUS._,"Were raised some hundred feet, till it o’ertopped"
276,_TIGELLINUS._,The Capitol—eh! lords. And so ’twere best;
277,_TIGELLINUS._,But still ’twill pass for good.
278,_TIGELLINUS._,
279,_TIGELLINUS._,_Luc._                        ’Twill be a palace
280,_TIGELLINUS._,For site and size the first in all the world.
281,_TIGELLINUS._,
282,_TIGELLINUS._,_Ner._ To kill the Jews’ brag of Jerusalem?
283,_TIGELLINUS._,
284,_TIGELLINUS._,_Oth._ I think it.
285,_TIGELLINUS._,
286,_TIGELLINUS._,"_Ner._             You, my friends, who know my scheme,"
287,_TIGELLINUS._,"May mete and judge my general scope in this,"
288,_TIGELLINUS._,A sample of my temper coined and uttered                          99
289,_TIGELLINUS._,"For the world’s model, that all men’s endeavours"
290,_TIGELLINUS._,"May rise with mine to have all things at best,"
291,_TIGELLINUS._,Not only for myself but for the world;
292,_TIGELLINUS._,Riches and joy and heart’s content for all.
293,_TIGELLINUS._,"It may be done, and who should do it but I?"
294,_TIGELLINUS._,"See now my years at best, my youth and strength"
295,_TIGELLINUS._,"With form and gifts agreeing, and my power,...."
296,_TIGELLINUS._,"Know’st thou my power?—Oh! Otho, I tell thee"
297,_TIGELLINUS._,The Cæsars which have been have never known
298,_TIGELLINUS._,What ’tis to be full Cæsar. Dost thou think?
299,_TIGELLINUS._,There’s nothing good on earth but may be won                     110
300,_TIGELLINUS._,With power and money; and I have them both;
301,_TIGELLINUS._,"Ay, and the will."
302,_TIGELLINUS._,
303,_TIGELLINUS._,"_Oth._            Much may be done, no doubt."
304,_TIGELLINUS._,
305,_TIGELLINUS._,"_Ner._ Much! Why there’s nothing, man, may not be done."
306,_TIGELLINUS._,"The curse of life is of our own devising,"
307,_TIGELLINUS._,Born of man’s ignorance and selfishness.
308,_TIGELLINUS._,He wounds his happiness against a cage
309,_TIGELLINUS._,"Of his own make, and only waits the word"
310,_TIGELLINUS._,"For one to set his door open,—and look,"
311,_TIGELLINUS._,Having his liberty is he not glad
312,_TIGELLINUS._,As heaven’s birds are?—Now when fate’s ordinance
313,_TIGELLINUS._,"Sends him a liberator, ay, and one                               121"
314,_TIGELLINUS._,"Not to cajole or preach, but, will or nill,"
315,_TIGELLINUS._,"Who’ll force him forth and crush up his old cage,"
316,_TIGELLINUS._,"With all who would hang back and skulk therein,"
317,_TIGELLINUS._,How shall he not be happy?
318,_TIGELLINUS._,
319,_TIGELLINUS._,_Luc._                     This shall be
320,_TIGELLINUS._,"The world’s last crown, by man with utmost power"
321,_TIGELLINUS._,Endowed to drive him to the good he shuns.
322,_TIGELLINUS._,
323,_TIGELLINUS._,_Ner._ Ay. Be all human hopes summed up in mine
324,_TIGELLINUS._,"And reach their goal. I say there shall be peace,"
325,_TIGELLINUS._,"There shall be plenty, pleasure, and content:                    130"
326,_TIGELLINUS._,The god on earth shall work the good whereof
327,_TIGELLINUS._,The folly of man hath baulked the gods in heaven:
328,_TIGELLINUS._,And good that men desire shall be as common
329,_TIGELLINUS._,As ills they now repine at. When I say
330,_TIGELLINUS._,"There shall be justice, see, even at my word"
331,_TIGELLINUS._,Injustice is no more.

339,_PARIS._,And need thy house.—Says he—It cost my sire
340,_PARIS._,"Ten million sesterces.—A trifle that,                            140"

346,_PARIS._,"_Ner._ Thou quibbling meddler, learn this point of wit,"
347,_PARIS._,To keep thy sphere; answer in that: last night
348,_PARIS._,Sang I divinely? Wert thou envious
349,_PARIS._,"When I put on the lion’s skin, and did"
350,_PARIS._,The choice of Hercules?
351,_PARIS._,
352,_PARIS._,"_Par._                Most mighty Cæsar,"
353,_PARIS._,I wished that I had asses ears to hear;
354,_PARIS._,Mine are not long enough.
355,_PARIS._,
356,_PARIS._,_Ner._                 Plague on thy jesting.
357,_PARIS._,See static virtue stalks with folded arm                         150

364,_PARIS._,If I extend my palace to take in
365,_PARIS._,The hill whereon we stand?
366,_PARIS._,
367,_PARIS._,_Thr._                    The plan no doubt
368,_PARIS._,"Is worthy of the site, and for the site,"
369,_PARIS._,"Why, ’tis the darling spot of Rome."
370,_PARIS._,
371,_PARIS._,_Ner._                            Well said.
372,_PARIS._,Stay. I would ask my fellow senator
373,_PARIS._,Wherefore he left the house three days ago
374,_PARIS._,Without his voice or vote.
375,_PARIS._,
376,_PARIS._,_Thr._                   I judged the time                     159
377,_PARIS._,"Unmeet to speak; and, for my vote, the senate"
378,_PARIS._,Was of one mind: a vote was of no count.
379,_PARIS._,
380,_PARIS._,_Ner._ Thou show’dst a sense against us in not voting.
381,_PARIS._,
382,_PARIS._,"_Thr._ That must thou look for, Cæsar, in the senate."
383,_PARIS._,
384,_PARIS._,"_Ner._ Well, I would have thee speak. We are not full"
385,_PARIS._,"Without thy voice: nay more, such conduct makes"
386,_PARIS._,The senate but a name; for times have been
387,_PARIS._,When silence was well justified by fear.
388,_PARIS._,"Now we court criticism, ay, and look ill"
389,_PARIS._,On those that grudge their approbation.                          169
390,_PARIS._,
391,_PARIS._,_Thr._ Cæsar commands my service and my praise;
392,_PARIS._,I shall not lack.
393,_PARIS._,
394,_PARIS._,_Ner._          We look for much from thee.
395,_PARIS._,
396,_PARIS._,_Thr._ Long live your majesty.      [_Exit._
397,_PARIS._,
398,_PARIS._,_Ner._                       There’s something good
399,_PARIS._,"In that man, Otho; spite of his dry mien"
400,_PARIS._,And Stoic fashion.
401,_PARIS._,
402,_PARIS._,"_Oth._           Nay, I like him not."
403,_PARIS._,He’s hardly flesh and blood. Old Seneca
404,_PARIS._,"Is stiff and prosy enough; but if you pinch him,"
405,_PARIS._,"You find he yields, shows softness here and there."
406,_PARIS._,"This man is merely stone, foursquare by rule."
407,_PARIS._,
408,_PARIS._,_Ner._ Do you despise divine philosophy?
409,_PARIS._,
410,_PARIS._,"_Oth._ Well, as I take it, all philosophy                      180"
411,_PARIS._,"Is questionable guessing, but the sense"
412,_PARIS._,A man grows up with bears the stamp of nature.
413,_PARIS._,
414,_PARIS._,_Ner._ How mean you that?
415,_PARIS._,
416,_PARIS._,_Oth._                    At best this fine-spun system
417,_PARIS._,Is but a part of man’s experience
418,_PARIS._,Drawn out to contradiction of the rest.
419,_PARIS._,’Tis a fool’s wisdom.
420,_PARIS._,
421,_PARIS._,_Luc._              ’Tis a form of pleasure.
422,_PARIS._,
423,_PARIS._,_Oth._ True. Though there be no theory of life
424,_PARIS._,"That’s worth a button, yet the search for one"
425,_PARIS._,Seems to content some men better than life.
426,_PARIS._,
427,_PARIS._,"_Ner._ Call him not fool, Otho!"
428,_PARIS._,
429,_PARIS._,"_Oth._                          Unless I wrong him,"
430,_PARIS._,I speak as well of him as he of me.                              191
431,_PARIS._,"Or if he say nothing, his guarded manner"
432,_PARIS._,"Covers, be sure, a more unkind contempt."
433,_PARIS._,
434,_PARIS._,"_Par._ (_apeing Thr._). That must thou look for, Cæsar, in the"
435,_PARIS._,senate.
436,_PARIS._,
437,_PARIS._,_Tig._ Ha! ha! Excellent!
438,_PARIS._,
439,_PARIS._,_Ner._                    Paris would make a senator.
440,_PARIS._,
441,_PARIS._,"_Oth._ Well, give me life."
442,_PARIS._,
443,_PARIS._,"_Ner._                    Ay, that is wisdom. Live."
444,_PARIS._,"Enjoy the hour; which minds me, for to-night"
445,_PARIS._,I have time well disposed: we sup with Actè;
446,_PARIS._,"She will inaugurate the new pavilion,"
447,_PARIS._,"And after, there are masks and clubs provided.                   200"
448,_PARIS._,"Thou’lt join us, eh!"
449,_PARIS._,
450,_PARIS._,_Oth._              With all my heart.
451,_PARIS._,
452,_PARIS._,_Ner._ (_to Tig. and Luc._).              And you.
453,_PARIS._,"And you. And, Paris, see Petronius comes,"
454,_PARIS._,"And Anicetus. Hence, and bid them now."
455,_PARIS._,
456,_PARIS._,[_Exit Paris._
457,_PARIS._,
458,_PARIS._,Good news for them I think; pleasure in store.
459,_PARIS._,"We’ll make a merry night. Now tell me, Otho,"
460,_PARIS._,"You’re a good judge, have you ever seen a woman"
461,_PARIS._,Fit to compare with Actè?
462,_PARIS._,
463,_PARIS._,_Oth._                    I say no.
464,_PARIS._,
465,_PARIS._,"_Ner._ I mean not, man, for what our grandsires praised,"
466,_PARIS._,Who knew no better; I mean the perfect art                       209
467,_PARIS._,Which makes each moment feverous.
468,_PARIS._,
469,_PARIS._,_Oth._                            I know none.
470,_PARIS._,
471,_PARIS._,_Ner._ ’Tis spoke as if thy judgment or thy envy
472,_PARIS._,Grudged me the word.
473,_PARIS._,
474,_PARIS._,"_Oth._             Nay, Cæsar."
475,_PARIS._,
476,_PARIS._,"_Ner._                        O, I know"
477,_PARIS._,"Thou’rt a good husband, thy good wife commands thee."
478,_PARIS._,
479,_PARIS._,"_Oth._ Say, my good fortune, Cæsar."
480,_PARIS._,
481,_PARIS._,_Ner._                            Now if thy boast
482,_PARIS._,"Be true as it is rare, thy lady’s presence"
483,_PARIS._,Would add much spirit to our gaieties.
484,_PARIS._,"I have never seen Poppæa, say that to-night"
485,_PARIS._,Thou bring her.
486,_PARIS._,
487,_PARIS._,"_Oth._          In this thing, for friendship’s sake,"
488,_PARIS._,Hold me excused.
489,_PARIS._,
490,_PARIS._,"_Ner._           Nay, no constraint; thy wish"
491,_PARIS._,"Is all in all. Wrong me not; I would not have,                   220"
492,_PARIS._,"And least to thee, my pleasures a command;"

506,_BRITANNICUS._,
507,_OCTAVIA._,_OCTAVIA._
508,_OCTAVIA._,
509,_OCTAVIA._,Most unkind.
510,_OCTAVIA._,
511,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._                 Weep not so.
512,_OCTAVIA._,"Octavia, weep not so."
513,_OCTAVIA._,"Count but my tears as thine, so shall my pity"
514,_OCTAVIA._,"Comfort thy wrongs. Nay, wert thou not my sister,"
515,_OCTAVIA._,How must I feel to see so base a rival
516,_OCTAVIA._,Honoured before thyself in Cæsar’s palace!
517,_OCTAVIA._,Why even his mother could not grant him that                     230
518,_OCTAVIA._,"Unmoved, but wept with rage: while he himself,"
519,_OCTAVIA._,"I saw, was touched with shame."
520,_OCTAVIA._,
521,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._                         Hush, hush! nay, ’tis not that;"
522,_OCTAVIA._,I mind not that: at least they tell me now
523,_OCTAVIA._,I must not mind; and since he never loved me
524,_OCTAVIA._,It matters little. ’Tis not that at all.
525,_OCTAVIA._,
526,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._ Then something fresh; what more?
527,_OCTAVIA._,
528,_OCTAVIA._,_Oct._                                 I scarce dare tell.
529,_OCTAVIA._,"What hast thou said or done, Britannicus,"
530,_OCTAVIA._,That so could anger him?
531,_OCTAVIA._,
532,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._                    Ah! is’t with me then
533,_OCTAVIA._,He is angry? Dost thou weep for me?
534,_OCTAVIA._,
535,_OCTAVIA._,_Oct._                              For both.
536,_OCTAVIA._,
537,_OCTAVIA._,"_Br._ Now tell me all, sister."
538,_OCTAVIA._,
539,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._                         O, ’tis the worst.              240"
540,_OCTAVIA._,"Here as I sat this morning strode he in,"
541,_OCTAVIA._,"More fired with rage than ever I have seen him,"
542,_OCTAVIA._,"More like his wicked mother, when her fury"
543,_OCTAVIA._,"Has made me tremble. All he said I heard not,"
544,_OCTAVIA._,"But this, that I, his wife, had turned against him"
545,_OCTAVIA._,"To plot with thee, and led thee on to boast"
546,_OCTAVIA._,"That being of age thou wert the rightful heir,"
547,_OCTAVIA._,And more: what is his meaning?
548,_OCTAVIA._,
549,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._                          ’Tis his spite
550,_OCTAVIA._,To seek my fault in thee.
551,_OCTAVIA._,
552,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._                    Nay, that were nothing."
553,_OCTAVIA._,"Brother, I fear thou wilt be sent from Rome.                     250"
554,_OCTAVIA._,He dare not face the truth. He cannot brook
555,_OCTAVIA._,"Thy title: thou must go, ay, thou wilt go"
556,_OCTAVIA._,And leave me in my prison.
557,_OCTAVIA._,
558,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._                      ’Twas last night
559,_OCTAVIA._,"I vexed him suddenly in his cups, but thought"

561,_OCTAVIA._,
562,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._                        Say, how was it?"
563,_OCTAVIA._,
564,_OCTAVIA._,"_Br_. It was the feast of Saturn,—and as it chanced"
565,_OCTAVIA._,"(Or rather, I should say, ’twas so arranged"
566,_OCTAVIA._,"To please him, at his own desire) he drew"
567,_OCTAVIA._,"The lot of king of the feast, and when the company"
568,_OCTAVIA._,Were drunk he used his silly privilege                           260
569,_OCTAVIA._,To have me be their fool.
570,_OCTAVIA._,
571,_OCTAVIA._,_Oct._                    Didst thou rebuke him?
572,_OCTAVIA._,
573,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._ It happened thus. When all the guests in turn
574,_OCTAVIA._,"Had answered to their forfeit, as his humour"
575,_OCTAVIA._,"Prescribed to each, he turned on me, and bade me"
576,_OCTAVIA._,"Show them a tragic scene, foreseeing how"
577,_OCTAVIA._,"The incongruence of time and place, the audience"
578,_OCTAVIA._,"Of drunken sots would turn my best to worst,"
579,_OCTAVIA._,And smother passion in a sea of laughter.
580,_OCTAVIA._,"But, for the wine I had been constrained to taste"
581,_OCTAVIA._,"Had mounted to my head, I felt at heart                          270"
582,_OCTAVIA._,"A force to wither up their sottish jeers,"
583,_OCTAVIA._,And ere I knew my purpose I was sitting
584,_OCTAVIA._,"Upright upon the couch, and with full passion"
585,_OCTAVIA._,Singing the old Greek song thou saidst so well
586,_OCTAVIA._,Suited our fortunes.
587,_OCTAVIA._,
588,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._               O, would I had been there!"
589,_OCTAVIA._,They could not laugh at thee.
590,_OCTAVIA._,
591,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._                         They did not laugh.
592,_OCTAVIA._,"The sadness and the sweetness of the music,"
593,_OCTAVIA._,"After their low hoarse songs, startled to sense"
594,_OCTAVIA._,"Their sodden, maudlin brains: they listened all"
595,_OCTAVIA._,"To the end, and then with daunted appetite                       280"
596,_OCTAVIA._,Sat in constraint and silence.
597,_OCTAVIA._,
598,_OCTAVIA._,_Oct._                         Oh! well done!
599,_OCTAVIA._,And what said Nero?
600,_OCTAVIA._,
601,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._               He but smiled until
602,_OCTAVIA._,The tale tells how the poor child disinherited
603,_OCTAVIA._,Was put to death by his usurping brother;
604,_OCTAVIA._,"Then his eye sank; and last, when Paris rose"
605,_OCTAVIA._,"At the end and praised my acting, he grew wild,"
606,_OCTAVIA._,"And said the feast was o’er, and bade us go."
607,_OCTAVIA._,
608,_OCTAVIA._,_Oct._ Alas! ’twas done too well.
609,_OCTAVIA._,
610,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._                             I mind it not:
611,_OCTAVIA._,I wear no mask: and manifold occasion
612,_OCTAVIA._,"Will oft surprise our closest guard, provoking                   290"
613,_OCTAVIA._,Unbidden motions that betray the heart:
614,_OCTAVIA._,"’Twere vain to seek to quell them: they are like our shadows,"
615,_OCTAVIA._,"Which, if the sun shine forth, appear and show"
616,_OCTAVIA._,Our form and figure. Such haps cannot be helped.

654,_AGRIPPINA._,Best call me mother. Thou hast need of me.
655,_AGRIPPINA._,I have heard all; what happed last night at supper.
656,_AGRIPPINA._,Thou hast offended Cæsar.
657,_AGRIPPINA._,
658,_AGRIPPINA._,_Br._                     He does wrong
659,_AGRIPPINA._,"To use the freedom of the feast to insult me,"

662,_AGRIPPINA._,
663,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                  True; the liberty

665,_AGRIPPINA._,"That which outcries thy speech; which, wert thou dumb,"
666,_AGRIPPINA._,"Would speak thee guilty, and being tongued proclaims"

708,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._ My dearest boy, believe me."
709,_AGRIPPINA._,
710,_AGRIPPINA._,_Br._                              The last time
711,_AGRIPPINA._,Thou call’dst me thus ’twas when my father died.
712,_AGRIPPINA._,"I thought then ’twas in kindness, afterwards"
713,_AGRIPPINA._,I found the meaning.
714,_AGRIPPINA._,
715,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._               Yea, I confess I wronged thee;"
716,_AGRIPPINA._,"That is my meaning now: had I not wronged thee,"
717,_AGRIPPINA._,My speech would have no sense at all: ’tis this
718,_AGRIPPINA._,I come to urge: in this thou must believe me.
719,_AGRIPPINA._,"Canst thou not see, had I no pity in me,"
720,_AGRIPPINA._,"No true remorseful pangs, yet still my wrongs                    360"
721,_AGRIPPINA._,"Would move me thus? Though thou trust not my love,"
722,_AGRIPPINA._,Read in these tears of anger and despair
723,_AGRIPPINA._,"The depth of my set purpose, my revenge."
724,_AGRIPPINA._,
725,_AGRIPPINA._,_Br._ I partly do believe thee.
726,_AGRIPPINA._,
727,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._                          Believe me wholly,"
728,_AGRIPPINA._,And my revenge is thine.
729,_AGRIPPINA._,
730,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Br._                    Nay, think not so."
731,_AGRIPPINA._,There’s blood in thy revenge; I’ll none of it.
732,_AGRIPPINA._,What are my private wrongs to Rome? If Cæsar
733,_AGRIPPINA._,"Stablish the empire, where’s the citizen"
734,_AGRIPPINA._,Will take exception that he hath wronged his brother?
735,_AGRIPPINA._,Since were I Cæsar I would vail my rights                        370
736,_AGRIPPINA._,"To theirs, I still will act as I were Cæsar."
737,_AGRIPPINA._,
738,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._ O could’st thou see this offer as thy last
739,_AGRIPPINA._,And only safety thou would’st not refuse me.
740,_AGRIPPINA._,
741,_AGRIPPINA._,_Br._ I rather hope to be forgiven the thing
742,_AGRIPPINA._,"I never thought, than win by doing it."
743,_AGRIPPINA._,
744,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                                 Thou wilt not join with me?
745,_AGRIPPINA._,
746,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Br._                          There’s nought to join,"
747,_AGRIPPINA._,Save to thy will to right me I might join
748,_AGRIPPINA._,"A hope of justice, to vain will vain hope."
749,_AGRIPPINA._,
750,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._ Think for thy sister, boy. She cannot long"
751,_AGRIPPINA._,"Be Cæsar’s wife. Then, were her brother Cæsar,"
752,_AGRIPPINA._,She might be matched with any excellence.                        381
753,_AGRIPPINA._,Octavia’s happiness lies on thy word.
754,_AGRIPPINA._,
755,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Br._ Octavia, dear Octavia—Now if thou’rt true"
756,_AGRIPPINA._,There is a way. This matter’s full presentment
757,_AGRIPPINA._,"Hath not been strange to me, though I have barred the thought"
758,_AGRIPPINA._,And held no purpose in it; there’s one way:
759,_AGRIPPINA._,Those that have wronged can right. If thou would’st speak
760,_AGRIPPINA._,"With Burrus, he is plain and honourable,"
761,_AGRIPPINA._,"And if he think there’s gain in the exchange,"
762,_AGRIPPINA._,"And his heart goes with it, he has the guards,—my name,          390"
763,_AGRIPPINA._,"The sense of right, the promise of a largess,"
764,_AGRIPPINA._,Will win them to a man. The senate follows:
765,_AGRIPPINA._,"In a day, an hour, without a drop of blood"
766,_AGRIPPINA._,My wrongs are righted. Wilt thou speak with Burrus?
767,_AGRIPPINA._,
768,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._ I dare not.
769,_AGRIPPINA._,
770,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Br._              Then do nothing. Or if thou canst,"
771,_AGRIPPINA._,Assure thy son that from my helpless state
772,_AGRIPPINA._,And suffering spirit he has nought to fear.
773,_AGRIPPINA._,
774,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._ Nay, thou wert right: and though ’tis difficult,"
775,_AGRIPPINA._,"I’ll speak with Burrus. ’Tis a most bold stroke,"
776,_AGRIPPINA._,But I can dare it. Good Burrus owes me much.      [_Exit._
777,_AGRIPPINA._,
778,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Br._ Strange, strange indeed. I have heard it said that murder   401"
779,_AGRIPPINA._,Falls on itself: that in the guilty breast
780,_AGRIPPINA._,The implacable crime ploughs up with rooting tusk
781,_AGRIPPINA._,The bleeding strings of nature: and in this woman
782,_AGRIPPINA._,Of no remorse hath fated vengeance stirred
783,_AGRIPPINA._,"Her heart to hate her son. O, I did wrong"
784,_AGRIPPINA._,"Yielding a little. Yet, since Burrus loves me,"
785,_AGRIPPINA._,That he should rule my fate is my best safety.
786,_AGRIPPINA._,"For her, if she’s my foe, he may work on her.—"
787,_AGRIPPINA._,These days have brought much change and food for fear.           410

800,_SENECA._,
801,_SENECA._,The Armenian papers came through me last evening;
802,_SENECA._,I sent them on at once.
803,_SENECA._,
804,_SENECA._,_BURRUS (refusing a seat)._
805,_SENECA._,
806,_SENECA._,"Nay, thank ye, Seneca:"
807,_SENECA._,I have been two hours in the saddle.
808,_SENECA._,
809,_SENECA._,_Sen._                               ’Tis a matter
810,_SENECA._,Of heavy import.
811,_SENECA._,
812,_SENECA._,_Bur._           I demanded audience.
813,_SENECA._,
814,_SENECA._,_Sen._ Well?
815,_SENECA._,
816,_SENECA._,_Bur._       All is settled.
817,_SENECA._,
818,_SENECA._,_Sen._                       And who has the commission
819,_SENECA._,To undertake the Parthian?
820,_SENECA._,
821,_SENECA._,_Bur._                     Corbulo.
822,_SENECA._,
823,_SENECA._,_Sen._ ’Tis good. I like the choice. And what said Nero?
824,_SENECA._,
825,_SENECA._,"_Bur._ He told me well and wisely what to do,"
826,_SENECA._,When I had shown him all that must be done.
827,_SENECA._,
828,_SENECA._,_Sen._ I wish his judgment were as tractable                   420
829,_SENECA._,With me. Took he your word?
830,_SENECA._,
831,_SENECA._,_Bur._                      The affair went pat.
832,_SENECA._,What luck for Corbulo!
833,_SENECA._,
834,_SENECA._,"_Sen._                 Pray sit, good Burrus,"
835,_SENECA._,And let us talk: my thought is most at ease
836,_SENECA._,When I am sitting.
837,_SENECA._,
838,_SENECA._,_Bur._             I pray you then be seated.
839,_SENECA._,
840,_SENECA._,"_Sen._ (_sitting_). Burrus, my difficulties day by day"
841,_SENECA._,Increase. The cares of empire are as nothing
842,_SENECA._,To managing an emperor.
843,_SENECA._,
844,_SENECA._,"_Bur._                  Why, what’s the matter?"
845,_SENECA._,
846,_SENECA._,_Sen._ Give but attention to me.
847,_SENECA._,
848,_SENECA._,_Bur._                           I attend.
849,_SENECA._,
850,_SENECA._,_Sen._ Do so most carefully: ’tis not a business
851,_SENECA._,That may be brushed aside.
852,_SENECA._,
853,_SENECA._,_Bur._                     I am all attention.                 430
854,_SENECA._,
855,_SENECA._,_Sen._ Nero has broken with Britannicus:
856,_SENECA._,Heard you of that?
857,_SENECA._,
858,_SENECA._,_Bur._             Heard of it? I was there.
859,_SENECA._,
860,_SENECA._,"_Sen._ Well, that has brought to head the jealous difference"
861,_SENECA._,"’Twixt Cæsar and his mother. Since he first,"
862,_SENECA._,"At our advice, as was most fit, denied her"
863,_SENECA._,"A place in power, she has striven to force a title"
864,_SENECA._,Out of her power for mischief: this you have seen:
865,_SENECA._,But now to hear how she hath edged her practice;
866,_SENECA._,She overskins her old accustomed hate
867,_SENECA._,"Of young Britannicus, speaks kindly of him,                      440"
868,_SENECA._,"Hints of his right; nay, even hath dared upbraid"
869,_SENECA._,Cæsar with usurpation. This was matched
870,_SENECA._,"With words from him, which she no sooner heard"
871,_SENECA._,Than in her rage disordered flew she hither
872,_SENECA._,To win me to her part; when seeing that I
873,_SENECA._,"Stood firm, she fled in furious passion, saying"
874,_SENECA._,That I should learn what temper she was of.
875,_SENECA._,
876,_SENECA._,_Bur._ I would that all the gods and goddesses
877,_SENECA._,Might burn them up to cinders.
878,_SENECA._,
879,_SENECA._,"_Sen._                         Peace, I say."
880,_SENECA._,Cannot you sit? I need your best advice.                         450
881,_SENECA._,
882,_SENECA._,_Bur._ Except the lad.—Advice concerning what?
883,_SENECA._,
884,_SENECA._,"_Sen_. Why this new phase of court affairs. See you,"
885,_SENECA._,
886,_SENECA._,[_Takes a paper._
887,_SENECA._,
888,_SENECA._,’Twas my just counterpoise of warring forces
889,_SENECA._,"Ensured stability. Here Agrippina,"
890,_SENECA._,Saved from her own ambition in the splendour
891,_SENECA._,"Of her son’s estate, serves in his interest"
892,_SENECA._,"To guard Britannicus, whom else he had feared."
893,_SENECA._,"The boy, in favour of his sister’s title,"
894,_SENECA._,"Sinks his own right. Then Nero’s youthful passions,"
895,_SENECA._,"Growing to hatred of Octavia’s bed,                              460"
896,_SENECA._,"Are stayed at equilibrium, as my judgment"
897,_SENECA._,And knowledge of the world enables me;
898,_SENECA._,"And all goes well, when an important factor,"
899,_SENECA._,"The empress, rounds, and plays me false to her motive,"
900,_SENECA._,"As here assumed, and vitiates with that flaw"
901,_SENECA._,The nice adjustment of each several item.—
902,_SENECA._,"I go to expound you this; you scarce attend,"
903,_SENECA._,Or answer with an oath.
904,_SENECA._,
905,_SENECA._,_Bur._                  A pious prayer
906,_SENECA._,To extricate you from a world of trouble.
907,_SENECA._,
908,_SENECA._,"_Sen._ O, I can do it, Burrus, trust to me.                    470"
909,_SENECA._,"I place them all as chessmen, and I find"
910,_SENECA._,"Delight in difficulty: but ’tis hard,"
911,_SENECA._,"When one has chosen, strengthened a position,"
912,_SENECA._,To change the value of a piece. I think
913,_SENECA._,"Much of your judgment, and I ask you now"
914,_SENECA._,What you would do. I must decide to-day.
915,_SENECA._,
916,_SENECA._,_Bur._ Why must?
917,_SENECA._,
918,_SENECA._,_Sen._           As if you knew not.
919,_SENECA._,
920,_SENECA._,_Bur._                               If your art
921,_SENECA._,Be to adapt yourself to every change....
922,_SENECA._,
923,_SENECA._,"_Sen._ You know ’tis not. I say, should Nero now"
924,_SENECA._,Banish his mother?
925,_SENECA._,
926,_SENECA._,"_Bur._             Hark ye, Seneca,                            480"
927,_SENECA._,"If you remember, I foresaw this trouble."
928,_SENECA._,"I know no remedy, nor is’t my office"
929,_SENECA._,"To arrange the affairs of the palace, gods be praised."
930,_SENECA._,"But this is clear to me, that our three friends"
931,_SENECA._,Will never live together: what I urge
932,_SENECA._,"Is, separate them: if you cannot that,"
933,_SENECA._,We must not stick in balance when they break.
934,_SENECA._,"Whene’er that happens, our pre-eminent duty"
935,_SENECA._,"Lies in our oath to Cæsar, and our second                        489"
936,_SENECA._,"May be his mother’s pleasure, to whose schemes"
937,_SENECA._,We owe our place.      [_Knocking heard._
938,_SENECA._,
939,_SENECA._,_Sen._            Who’s there? come in.
940,_SENECA._,
941,_SENECA._,_Enter Servant._
942,_SENECA._,
943,_SERVANT._,_SERVANT._
944,_SERVANT._,
945,_SERVANT._,The Augusta
946,_SERVANT._,"Has come in private, and desires an audience."
947,_SERVANT._,
948,_SERVANT._,"_Sen._ Again, you see, the Augusta."
949,_SERVANT._,
950,_SERVANT._,_Bur._                              Eh! I’ll be off.
951,_SERVANT._,
952,_SERVANT._,"_Sen._ One moment, pray. (_To Servt._) Beg her be"
953,_SERVANT._,pleased to enter.      [_Exit Servt._
954,_SERVANT._,
955,_SERVANT._,"Burrus, I adjure you not to go, your presence"
956,_SERVANT._,"May moderate her passion: or, if not,"
957,_SERVANT._,’Twere best you saw it.
958,_SERVANT._,
959,_SERVANT._,"_Bur._                  Well, all’s one to me."
960,_SERVANT._,
961,_SERVANT._,_Enter Agrippina._
962,_SERVANT._,
963,_AGRIPPINA._,_AGRIPPINA._
964,_AGRIPPINA._,
965,_AGRIPPINA._,Be not surprised that I so soon return:
966,_AGRIPPINA._,I have repented. Ha! the general here!
967,_AGRIPPINA._,"Thou seest me, Burrus, on a woman’s errand.                      500"
968,_AGRIPPINA._,"Nay, no apology; thou hast o’erheard"
969,_AGRIPPINA._,"My merit, not my fault."
970,_AGRIPPINA._,
971,_AGRIPPINA._,_Bur._                  I thank your majesty.
972,_AGRIPPINA._,I will withdraw.
973,_AGRIPPINA._,
974,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._           Nay, I desire thee stay."
975,_AGRIPPINA._,I came not here to find thee; but thy presence
976,_AGRIPPINA._,Mends my intention. Let us hold a council.
977,_AGRIPPINA._,"’Tis not the first time our triumvirate,"
978,_AGRIPPINA._,"Secretly gathered in the nick of time,"
979,_AGRIPPINA._,Hath preordained the changes which should fall
980,_AGRIPPINA._,"Upon the earth like fate. To-day’s decree,"
981,_AGRIPPINA._,"If we combine, will be as big with action                        510"
982,_AGRIPPINA._,As any we have uttered.
983,_AGRIPPINA._,
984,_AGRIPPINA._,_Bur._                  I fear I stand
985,_AGRIPPINA._,In ignorance of the question.
986,_AGRIPPINA._,
987,_AGRIPPINA._,_Sen._                        I will explain.
988,_AGRIPPINA._,
989,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._ Listen to me. We three who here are met
990,_AGRIPPINA._,"Stand in such place, that, if we but unite,"
991,_AGRIPPINA._,There’s none can say us nay. I do not ask
992,_AGRIPPINA._,"Who raised thee, Burrus, or thee, Seneca,"
993,_AGRIPPINA._,"To where ye are: nay, if I asked you that"
994,_AGRIPPINA._,I’d look for no more answer than if asking
995,_AGRIPPINA._,"What two and two make; ’tis self-evident,"
996,_AGRIPPINA._,Unquestioned; it was I; and if you owe                           520
997,_AGRIPPINA._,"Allegiance to another, ’tis to one"
998,_AGRIPPINA._,"Whom I made more than I made you; ay, one"
999,_AGRIPPINA._,"Who has nothing but what was mine, and is mine:"
1000,_AGRIPPINA._,"His body mine, his life and being mine,"
1001,_AGRIPPINA._,"His power, his place, his honour mine, my son,"
1002,_AGRIPPINA._,"My Nero, who, when my husband late deceased,"
1003,_AGRIPPINA._,"The honest Claudius, passed to join the gods,"
1004,_AGRIPPINA._,"Was raised and set by me under your guidance,"
1005,_AGRIPPINA._,To share with me the empire of the world.
1006,_AGRIPPINA._,Now what it may be that hath warped his heart                    530
1007,_AGRIPPINA._,Is from the matter: enough that so it is.
1008,_AGRIPPINA._,"I might blame one of you, sure not myself,"
1009,_AGRIPPINA._,Who have ever held in love and kindness towards him
1010,_AGRIPPINA._,"The same intention; nay, and from my kindness"
1011,_AGRIPPINA._,"I swerve not now, though for a wholesome end"
1012,_AGRIPPINA._,I mask that kindness in severity.
1013,_AGRIPPINA._,"There’s but this choice, I must withdraw my favour,"
1014,_AGRIPPINA._,"Or suffer my disgrace: ay, and for you,"
1015,_AGRIPPINA._,"Burrus and Seneca, be sure, the same."
1016,_AGRIPPINA._,"If I fall, ye will fall. Therefore being one                     540"
1017,_AGRIPPINA._,"In interest with me, I look to find you ready"
1018,_AGRIPPINA._,To stand by me in any scheme of action
1019,_AGRIPPINA._,"Which may preserve our station, while we may."
1020,_AGRIPPINA._,
1021,_AGRIPPINA._,_Sen._ Your majesty says well. We have hitherto
1022,_AGRIPPINA._,"All held one purpose, and if now we are foiled"
1023,_AGRIPPINA._,"Or thwarted, none is thwarted more than I."
1024,_AGRIPPINA._,"And since it is my pride, in the high place"
1025,_AGRIPPINA._,"Whereto your judgment called me, to exceed"
1026,_AGRIPPINA._,"The measure which might justify your choice,"
1027,_AGRIPPINA._,I shall not fail. In these new difficulties                      550
1028,_AGRIPPINA._,I would make no display of fresh resource;
1029,_AGRIPPINA._,"Full means there will be, yet what means it is"
1030,_AGRIPPINA._,I am not ripe to say.
1031,_AGRIPPINA._,
1032,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._                What say’st thou, Burrus?"
1033,_AGRIPPINA._,The matter Seneca avoids is this:
1034,_AGRIPPINA._,"Shall I be driven to exile, or will ye"
1035,_AGRIPPINA._,Join with me to forbid it?
1036,_AGRIPPINA._,
1037,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Bur._                     Hath your majesty,"
1038,_AGRIPPINA._,"In urging opposition, any scheme"
1039,_AGRIPPINA._,That might give life to policy?
1040,_AGRIPPINA._,
1041,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._                          Ay, something."
1042,_AGRIPPINA._,I would protect Britannicus: his claim
1043,_AGRIPPINA._,"And popularity being pressed, must drive                         560"
1044,_AGRIPPINA._,Nero upon my side.
1045,_AGRIPPINA._,
1046,_AGRIPPINA._,_Bur._             Such act were merely
1047,_AGRIPPINA._,"The boy’s destruction, were’t not done in earnest"
1048,_AGRIPPINA._,And backed by force.
1049,_AGRIPPINA._,
1050,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._               Then, since the case demands"
1051,_AGRIPPINA._,"All earnestness, and since we lack not force....."
1052,_AGRIPPINA._,
1053,_AGRIPPINA._,_Bur._ Between your son’s rule and your stepson’s claim
1054,_AGRIPPINA._,There lies no middle way.
1055,_AGRIPPINA._,
1056,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                    I never held
1057,_AGRIPPINA._,That a stout purpose chose a middle way.

1068,_AGRIPPINA._,
1069,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Bur._ Were this in earnest, yet my oath to Cæsar"
1070,_AGRIPPINA._,Forbids me even to think the thing you say.
1071,_AGRIPPINA._,
1072,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._ Thy oath to him! Rather to me ’twas sworn;
1073,_AGRIPPINA._,"Who raised thee up to swear, and made the Cæsar"
1074,_AGRIPPINA._,For thee to swear to? I can dispense your oaths:
1075,_AGRIPPINA._,"Or rather, since they were unjustly sworn,"
1076,_AGRIPPINA._,Justice dispenses them. ’Twould be a deed

1078,_AGRIPPINA._,
1079,_AGRIPPINA._,_Bur._ Justice is still against you. ’Twas unjust
1080,_AGRIPPINA._,To burn the will of Claudius; ’twas unjust
1081,_AGRIPPINA._,"To hide Britannicus, and to bring forth"
1082,_AGRIPPINA._,"Your own son in his place: these things were wrongs,"
1083,_AGRIPPINA._,And these old wrongs would you redub with new.
1084,_AGRIPPINA._,"For when upon your wrongs Rome set her seal,"
1085,_AGRIPPINA._,"Her choice made right of wrong, and we that swore,"
1086,_AGRIPPINA._,"Swore not to Nero or Britannicus,"

1090,_AGRIPPINA._,
1091,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Sen._ Burrus is right; and were he wrong, your scheme"
1092,_AGRIPPINA._,But complicates the mischief.
1093,_AGRIPPINA._,
1094,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                        Then ye desert me?
1095,_AGRIPPINA._,
1096,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Sen._ Nay, nay, in other ways I may do much."
1097,_AGRIPPINA._,I may win Nero back.
1098,_AGRIPPINA._,
1099,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._               The thought is folly;

1101,_AGRIPPINA._,
1102,_AGRIPPINA._,_Sen._                Oh! ’tis open treason.
1103,_AGRIPPINA._,
1104,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._ Eh! Why, I think my son’s ingratitude"
1105,_AGRIPPINA._,Is nought to this; he had the right to expect
1106,_AGRIPPINA._,"My favours: but for you, whom I chose out"
1107,_AGRIPPINA._,"And set above the rest because I chose,"
1108,_AGRIPPINA._,"Made you my friends because I chose, for you                     600"
1109,_AGRIPPINA._,"There is no excuse. Had ye no motive, yet"
1110,_AGRIPPINA._,"To see a woman in distress like mine,"
1111,_AGRIPPINA._,"Wronged by her son, and injured as no woman"
1112,_AGRIPPINA._,"Has ever been, should rouse a manly spirit,"
1113,_AGRIPPINA._,"Ay, make a coward burn to do me right."
1114,_AGRIPPINA._,"But ye stand there aloof, and not a word."
1115,_AGRIPPINA._,"O good Seneca,"

1117,_AGRIPPINA._,"The stoic letters of thine exile, writ"

1120,_AGRIPPINA._,"I have it still, the letter, superscribed"
1121,_AGRIPPINA._,_Your most devoted slave._ Was not that felt?
1122,_AGRIPPINA._,Had’st thou not cause? Now is the opportunity

1124,_AGRIPPINA._,"All that those hard times strove for, all they won."
1125,_AGRIPPINA._,"The faith thou owest me, still may make all mine;"

1127,_AGRIPPINA._,
1128,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Sen._                Alas, good lady!"
1129,_AGRIPPINA._,
1130,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                                 Alas!
1131,_AGRIPPINA._,Is this the vein? Think you I come to hear
1132,_AGRIPPINA._,"Your lamentations? Ah! ye dare, I see,                           620"
1133,_AGRIPPINA._,Pity me while ye wrong me: but the truth
1134,_AGRIPPINA._,"Ye dare not say. Ye dare not say, Lo, we,"
1135,_AGRIPPINA._,"Raised by your clemency, sworn to your service,"
1136,_AGRIPPINA._,"Seeing your fair wind is changed, and there’s no hope"
1137,_AGRIPPINA._,"Left to your following, do as all knaves do,"
1138,_AGRIPPINA._,"Leave you to perish. Ah, all’s lost, all’s lost!      [_Weeps._"

1152,_AGRIPPINA._,"Philosopher! Ay, thou that teachest youth"

1251,_SELEUCUS._,"If he held off yet he so far was right,"

1270,_SELEUCUS._,Her tampering with Britannicus is nought:
1271,_SELEUCUS._,"But if she speak with Burrus, there is matter                    700"

1387,_OTHO._,You bring your merriment; but at the door
1388,_OTHO._,"’Tis left, and in you come, in solemn glumness,"
1389,_OTHO._,To vent the sour reaction of your revels
1390,_OTHO._,Upon your housekeeper.
1391,_OTHO._,
1392,_OTHO._,"_Oth._                 Enough, Poppæa;"
1393,_OTHO._,I would be cheered.
1394,_OTHO._,
1395,_OTHO._,"_Pop._              Then I will cheer thee, love."
1396,_OTHO._,But what’s the matter?
1397,_OTHO._,
1398,_OTHO._,_Oth._                 Listen. Thou hast reproached me
1399,_OTHO._,With going forth alone. What else could be?                      760
1400,_OTHO._,"Would’st thou consent to sit there at my side,"
1401,_OTHO._,"Where I, a man, am oft ashamed to sit?"
1402,_OTHO._,"Would’st thou, could’st thou be one among the women"
1403,_OTHO._,Of Cæsar’s fancy?
1404,_OTHO._,
1405,_OTHO._,_Pop._            I spake not seriously.
1406,_OTHO._,
1407,_OTHO._,"_Oth._ See, but I do. I tell thee, love, this night"
1408,_OTHO._,Thou wert invited.
1409,_OTHO._,
1410,_OTHO._,_Pop._             I!
1411,_OTHO._,
1412,_OTHO._,_Oth._                He would have pressed it.
1413,_OTHO._,
1414,_OTHO._,_Pop._ Who would have pressed it?
1415,_OTHO._,
1416,_OTHO._,_Oth._                            Cæsar.
1417,_OTHO._,
1418,_OTHO._,_Pop._                                   What dost thou say?
1419,_OTHO._,
1420,_OTHO._,(_Aside._) He treads on prophecy.
1421,_OTHO._,
1422,_OTHO._,"_Oth._                            Knowing thy mind,"
1423,_OTHO._,"And mine, I begged him for our friendship’s sake"
1424,_OTHO._,Urge me no further.
1425,_OTHO._,
1426,_OTHO._,"_Pop._              Thou did’st well, and he?                  770"
1427,_OTHO._,
1428,_OTHO._,_Oth._ Again to-night he asked for thee. ’Twas this
1429,_OTHO._,Which made me sad and thoughtful.
1430,_OTHO._,
1431,_OTHO._,_Pop._                            Why be sad?
1432,_OTHO._,
1433,_OTHO._,"_Oth._ The meaning, love, the meaning: thou must guess it."
1434,_OTHO._,
1435,_OTHO._,"_Pop._ The very reason, Otho, which thou urgest"
1436,_OTHO._,"Against my going, is in truth the reason"
1437,_OTHO._,"Why such as I should go. As Cæsar’s friend,"
1438,_OTHO._,Thou would’st do well to save him from the slough
1439,_OTHO._,He daily sinks in.
1440,_OTHO._,
1441,_OTHO._,"_Oth._             Nay, but such a stake"
1442,_OTHO._,For such a flimsy hope.
1443,_OTHO._,
1444,_OTHO._,_Pop._                  I see a hope
1445,_OTHO._,"In the invitation. Otho, let us see                              780"
1446,_OTHO._,What may be done among his friends.
1447,_OTHO._,
1448,_OTHO._,"_Oth._                              Poppæa,"
1449,_OTHO._,"’Tis generously thought, but ’tis a thing"
1450,_OTHO._,"Must not be thought. Trust to my judgment, love."
1451,_OTHO._,’Tis Cæsar’s love of power that threats us here;
1452,_OTHO._,"He would have nought held from him. Thee I hold,"
1453,_OTHO._,And most because I know thou would’st be mine.
1454,_OTHO._,
1455,_OTHO._,"_Pop._ Then thou must trust me, Otho."
1456,_OTHO._,
1457,_OTHO._,_Oth._                                And so I do.
1458,_OTHO._,
1459,_OTHO._,"_Pop._ Why, I were well his match. Let us go in."

1475,_AGRIPPINA._,"Farewell, we still are friends: the debt I owe"
1476,_AGRIPPINA._,I shall remember: ’twas thy power that first
1477,_AGRIPPINA._,"Gave root to mine: for thee, I think my favours"

1608,_DOMITIA._,For banter or abuse. I am ill to-day.
1609,_DOMITIA._,
1610,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._ No wonder; ’tis you do too much. ’Twere better

1618,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                      My sickness will not pass.
1619,_DOMITIA._,To-morrow I shall leave thee; that last grief
1620,_DOMITIA._,Will soon engulph the rest: speak while thou may’st.

1623,_DOMITIA._,
1624,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                                  I would spare thee

1630,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                    ’Tis well resolved.
1631,_DOMITIA._,"I have been foolish; ’twas a mother’s fault,"
1632,_DOMITIA._,"A tender fault: forget it, and hereafter"
1633,_DOMITIA._,Know my love better. If my presence bred
1634,_DOMITIA._,"Dislike, thy kinder mind may yet return"

1637,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._          Why, what has happed, I pray?"

1643,_DOMITIA._,’Tis the old story told a thousand times.
1644,_DOMITIA._,

1646,_DOMITIA._,"I think, have dug my grave. Dost thou remember"
1647,_DOMITIA._,What answer once I made the sorcerer                             881
1648,_DOMITIA._,"Who prophesied thy fortune? Thy son, he said,"
1649,_DOMITIA._,"Shall reign, and kill his mother. Let him kill me,"
1650,_DOMITIA._,"So that he reign, I cried. He spake the truth,"
1651,_DOMITIA._,But ’tis by grief thou slay’st me.
1652,_DOMITIA._,
1653,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._                             That old rubbish

1655,_DOMITIA._,
1656,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._               Indeed, I had forgot it:"
1657,_DOMITIA._,But yesternight I dreamed it all again;
1658,_DOMITIA._,A frightful dream: plain as I see thee now

1661,_DOMITIA._,[_She acts._

1664,_DOMITIA._,"Did’st only laugh the more. Then ran I to thee,"
1665,_DOMITIA._,"And bared my breast, and cried, Kill me, O son!"
1666,_DOMITIA._,"And thou fastened’st thy snaky eyes upon me,"
1667,_DOMITIA._,So that I could not see what thy hand did.
1668,_DOMITIA._,"But, oh! I knew. I heard thy weapon grate"
1669,_DOMITIA._,"Leaving the scabbard, and a fiery pang"
1670,_DOMITIA._,Pierced through my heart. Ah!
1671,_DOMITIA._,
1672,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._ (_aside_). Heavens, is she mad?—"
1673,_DOMITIA._,"Mother, good mother, mother!                                     899"
1674,_DOMITIA._,
1675,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ ’Twas nothing. Nay, where am I? I was come"
1676,_DOMITIA._,To hear thy speech. What is’t thou hast to say?
1677,_DOMITIA._,
1678,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._ (_aside_). If this were trickery? Let the fact try.—
1679,_DOMITIA._,’Twas this: what speech you held the other morning
1680,_DOMITIA._,With young Britannicus.

1683,_DOMITIA._,"Thy spies are most alert. This time, at least,"
1684,_DOMITIA._,I praise their zeal: though thou art slow to thank me
1685,_DOMITIA._,For my kind service done to thee and him.
1686,_DOMITIA._,
1687,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._ Whether is it kinder, say you, to him to urge him"
1688,_DOMITIA._,"To embrace the desperate plot, of which already"
1689,_DOMITIA._,"He stood suspected, or more kind to me                           910"
1690,_DOMITIA._,To water this rebellion with the tears
1691,_DOMITIA._,Of your insidious passion?
1692,_DOMITIA._,
1693,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                     Your man’s a fool: I heard
1694,_DOMITIA._,"Your quarrel, and took pains to sound the boy."
1695,_DOMITIA._,
1696,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._ Next you saw Burrus.
1697,_DOMITIA._,
1698,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._                      Well, and what said he?"
1699,_DOMITIA._,

1701,_DOMITIA._,
1702,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                              ’Twas this: Britannicus
1703,_DOMITIA._,"Most truly said that nought could help his claim,"
1704,_DOMITIA._,Except the guards and Burrus: at which word
1705,_DOMITIA._,"I flew to Burrus, offered him the bait;"
1706,_DOMITIA._,"And when he showed the scruple of his oath,"
1707,_DOMITIA._,Three words from me confirmed him.                               920
1708,_DOMITIA._,
1709,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._                             If this were true!
1710,_DOMITIA._,
1711,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ How much you need me, Nero, will be plain"
1712,_DOMITIA._,When I am gone. Who has deceived you now?
1713,_DOMITIA._,"Who works this madness in you, to conceive"
1714,_DOMITIA._,That your disaster could be gain to me?
1715,_DOMITIA._,Have you believed what angry words I spoke
1716,_DOMITIA._,"Were born of purpose, that my threats against you"
1717,_DOMITIA._,"Were aught but passion? You count not the tears,"
1718,_DOMITIA._,"The bitter, secret tears, for every pang"
1719,_DOMITIA._,"Your wrongs have wrought in me; and bitterer far,"
1720,_DOMITIA._,The sharp remorse for each retaliation                           930
1721,_DOMITIA._,Of speech provoked in anger. Let it end;
1722,_DOMITIA._,’Tis best I go.
1723,_DOMITIA._,
1724,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._          See! if you had gone before

1726,_DOMITIA._,"By going, ’tis a quarrel that you go."
1727,_DOMITIA._,
1728,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ No quarrel, nay. ’Tis only this: I thought"
1729,_DOMITIA._,That in your love I held perpetual office.
1730,_DOMITIA._,’Tis not so. Now my time is out: I go
1731,_DOMITIA._,As Pallas goes.
1732,_DOMITIA._,
1733,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._          The sleek, extortionate Pallas,"
1734,_DOMITIA._,Dost thou defend the despicable Pallas?
1735,_DOMITIA._,
1736,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ I would be kind to friends; none will stand by you, 940"
1737,_DOMITIA._,If you cast off those to whom most you owe.
1738,_DOMITIA._,’Twas first through him I came to seize the power
1739,_DOMITIA._,That made you Cæsar. Look! you have lost a friend.
1740,_DOMITIA._,Be wiser when I am gone.
1741,_DOMITIA._,
1742,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._                   I have good friends,"
1743,_DOMITIA._,Burrus and Seneca: I trust them both.
1744,_DOMITIA._,
1745,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._ Cannot you read the cause why still they urge you
1746,_DOMITIA._,To cast me off?
1747,_DOMITIA._,
1748,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._          ’Tis the disgrace they feel
1749,_DOMITIA._,To see the empire managed by a woman.
1750,_DOMITIA._,
1751,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._ ’Tis the constraint they feel in all their actions
1752,_DOMITIA._,Being overruled by me. Do you not see                            950
1753,_DOMITIA._,"They are my ministers, and you are ruled"
1754,_DOMITIA._,"By them in all they counsel? Rid of me,"
1755,_DOMITIA._,"They rule the world. Think you, when they have cast"
1756,_DOMITIA._,"What was above them underneath their feet,"
1757,_DOMITIA._,They will have care to exalt what was below?
1758,_DOMITIA._,
1759,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._ They both are honest men; you chose them well.
1760,_DOMITIA._,
1761,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ You are too trustful, Nero. As you love"
1762,_DOMITIA._,"Your life, I say, be jealous of these men;"
1763,_DOMITIA._,These men that now would rule thee but to take
1764,_DOMITIA._,The empire from thy hands. They may speak ill                    960
1765,_DOMITIA._,"Of me,—believe that if thou list,—but oh!"
1766,_DOMITIA._,"If once they seem to encroach, delay not then;"
1767,_DOMITIA._,"Hear no excuse nor explanation; strike,"
1768,_DOMITIA._,"Kill them, I say, before they murder thee."
1769,_DOMITIA._,
1770,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._ But, mother, Seneca loves me."
1771,_DOMITIA._,
1772,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                               As a master
1773,_DOMITIA._,Will love a pupil while he takes instruction.
1774,_DOMITIA._,He’ll love you while you let him reign. Alas!
1775,_DOMITIA._,I scarce dare leave you to him. You are too kind;
1776,_DOMITIA._,Will shrink to use the sword as it is needful
1777,_DOMITIA._,For one who rules to wield.
1778,_DOMITIA._,
1779,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._                      You cannot think                   970
1780,_DOMITIA._,These men would serve me so.
1781,_DOMITIA._,
1782,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                       What is my purpose?
1783,_DOMITIA._,"My life’s one object, my supreme ambition?"
1784,_DOMITIA._,"Was’t not to raise thee where thou art, and now"
1785,_DOMITIA._,Is’t not to keep thee there?
1786,_DOMITIA._,
1787,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._                       So once I thought.
1788,_DOMITIA._,
1789,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ O think it yet. Look! there is none can love you,"
1790,_DOMITIA._,"Nero, as I must love you; there’s not one"
1791,_DOMITIA._,Can guard you as I can. Have I not proved
1792,_DOMITIA._,"My power? While I am by you, it is yours."
1793,_DOMITIA._,
1794,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._ Stay then.
1795,_DOMITIA._,
1796,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._            O that it might be!
1797,_DOMITIA._,
1798,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._                                Thou shalt not go.
1799,_DOMITIA._,Resign thy outward power; be in all else                         980
1800,_DOMITIA._,As heretofore. Forget what I suspected.
1801,_DOMITIA._,Be still my mother.
1802,_DOMITIA._,
1803,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._              Alas!
1804,_DOMITIA._,
1805,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._                    Yea, I will have it."
1806,_DOMITIA._,
1807,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._ It cannot be.
1808,_DOMITIA._,
1809,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._               Why not?
1810,_DOMITIA._,
1811,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._                        Seneca, my son,"
1812,_DOMITIA._,Will not permit it.
1813,_DOMITIA._,
1814,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._              Who is Seneca
1815,_DOMITIA._,To say me nay?
1816,_DOMITIA._,
1817,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._         Unless you join with me
1818,_DOMITIA._,He will o’errule you.
1819,_DOMITIA._,
1820,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._                He shall not o’errule me.
1821,_DOMITIA._,
1822,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._ For that I’d stay. I would give up all else
1823,_DOMITIA._,"To stand by you: ay, and be happy so."
1824,_DOMITIA._,
1825,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._ And so it shall be. Have thy private fortune,"
1826,_DOMITIA._,Remain in Rome.
1827,_DOMITIA._,
1828,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._          But can you trust me, Nero?                    990"
1829,_DOMITIA._,
1830,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._ Nay, I will never more suspect thee. Kiss me."
1831,_DOMITIA._,
1832,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ O, now you are good and kind. Tell me, who was it"
1833,_DOMITIA._,Did me this wrong?
1834,_DOMITIA._,
1835,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._             It was Domitia told me.
1836,_DOMITIA._,She spied on thee.
1837,_DOMITIA._,
1838,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._             My sister! ha! you know not
1839,_DOMITIA._,The grudge between us?
1840,_DOMITIA._,
1841,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._                 Yes, I know of that."
1842,_DOMITIA._,
1843,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._ And not suspect her slander? Did she also
1844,_DOMITIA._,Commit Britannicus?
1845,_DOMITIA._,
1846,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._              She cast all blame
1847,_DOMITIA._,On thee.
1848,_DOMITIA._,
1849,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._   I feared she might have wronged the boy.
1850,_DOMITIA._,
1851,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._ Is he, then, innocent?"
1852,_DOMITIA._,
1853,_DOMITIA._,_Agr._                        I went so far
1854,_DOMITIA._,In sounding him as even to risk my credit.                      1000
1855,_DOMITIA._,Let not unjust suspicion add a weight
1856,_DOMITIA._,To the just blame we bear. You must protect him.
1857,_DOMITIA._,Promise me that.
1858,_DOMITIA._,
1859,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._           I will ask Seneca.
1860,_DOMITIA._,
1861,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._ Forgive, at least, his foolish indiscretion."
1862,_DOMITIA._,He begged me make his peace. Now have I made it?
1863,_DOMITIA._,
1864,_DOMITIA._,_Ner._ I’ll think no more of that.
1865,_DOMITIA._,
1866,_DOMITIA._,"_Agr._                             My dearest son,"
1867,_DOMITIA._,The joy of a good action will be yours
1868,_DOMITIA._,"As well as mine. O, I am happy now—"
1869,_DOMITIA._,"Indeed, most happy now."
1870,_DOMITIA._,
1871,_DOMITIA._,"_Ner._                  Come then, dear mother."

1885,_SENECA._,_SENECA._
1886,_SENECA._,
1887,_SENECA._,"Burrus was right. The more I think of it,"
1888,_SENECA._,The time has come that one or both must go;
1889,_SENECA._,"So the more dangerous first, then are we quit"
1890,_SENECA._,At once of all our mischief and disgrace.                       1013
1891,_SENECA._,’Tis past belief that she who plunged in crime
1892,_SENECA._,To enthrone her son should now plot to dethrone him.
1893,_SENECA._,There is no bridle for a wicked woman.
1894,_SENECA._,Men may despise the venerable path
1895,_SENECA._,"Of virtue, and refuse the wholesome laws"
1896,_SENECA._,"Of plain philosophy, but still they lean"
1897,_SENECA._,"Towards reason, even in their wickedness.                       1020"
1898,_SENECA._,There’s an accountable consistency
1899,_SENECA._,Found in their actions; but if once a woman
1900,_SENECA._,"Throw off, as men soon do, the first restraints"
1901,_SENECA._,Of credulous childhood; if her nature lack
1902,_SENECA._,"Tenderness, modesty, and that respect"
1903,_SENECA._,To self which sees in self a thing to guard
1904,_SENECA._,"From passion and caprice, and in the pleasure"
1905,_SENECA._,"Of fitness finds a law,—if she lack that"
1906,_SENECA._,"Or overpass it,—there’s no further bound:"
1907,_SENECA._,"All things are mixed together; virtue, crime,                   1030"
1908,_SENECA._,Wisdom and folly. For they have a spirit
1909,_SENECA._,"Of infinite wrong genius. Rule, I say,"
1910,_SENECA._,Such women if you can; rule them with iron.

1912,_SENECA._,_Enter Nero._
1913,_SENECA._,
1914,_NERO._,_NERO._
1915,_NERO._,
1916,_NERO._,"Good-morrow, Seneca. Thou comest in time;"
1917,_NERO._,I need thy counsel.
1918,_NERO._,
1919,_NERO._,_Sen._              I am here to give it.
1920,_NERO._,
1921,_NERO._,"_Ner._ Then tell me: Where I have been lately threatened,"
1922,_NERO._,Am I in danger? I will use thy judgment.
1923,_NERO._,Is’t needful for my safety to remove
1924,_NERO._,Britannicus?
1925,_NERO._,
1926,_NERO._,_Sen._       I have well considered all.
1927,_NERO._,You must dismiss your mother.                                   1040
1928,_NERO._,
1929,_NERO._,"_Ner._                        Not so, Seneca."
1930,_NERO._,"She now resigns all power and sign of empire,"
1931,_NERO._,"And is content to live in quiet, retired"
1932,_NERO._,With few attendants and contracted state.
1933,_NERO._,
1934,_NERO._,_Sen._ She offered terms?
1935,_NERO._,
1936,_NERO._,"_Ner._                    See, since she now concedes"
1937,_NERO._,"All reasonable claims, my duty towards her"
1938,_NERO._,Patches our quarrel.
1939,_NERO._,
1940,_NERO._,_Sen._               Whence this newborn trust?
1941,_NERO._,
1942,_NERO._,_Ner._ She must remain. What of Britannicus?
1943,_NERO._,
1944,_NERO._,_Sen._ He need not trouble you.
1945,_NERO._,
1946,_NERO._,_Ner._                          So said my mother.
1947,_NERO._,"I had thought differently, and even had made"
1948,_NERO._,Full preparation for his going hence.                           1050
1949,_NERO._,Would’st thou too bid me think there is no danger?
1950,_NERO._,
1951,_NERO._,"_Sen._ None, if your mother goes."
1952,_NERO._,
1953,_NERO._,"_Ner._                            But nay, she stays."
1954,_NERO._,
1955,_NERO._,_Sen._ That makes him dangerous.
1956,_NERO._,
1957,_NERO._,"_Ner._                           Thy reason, Seneca?"
1958,_NERO._,
1959,_NERO._,"_Sen._ I well can guess, Nero, your mother’s vein"
1960,_NERO._,With you in private: but ’twould much divert
1961,_NERO._,"Your inclination from it, could you know"
1962,_NERO._,Her latest way with me.
1963,_NERO._,
1964,_NERO._,_Ner._                  What hath she said?
1965,_NERO._,
1966,_NERO._,_Sen._ Will you now think she hath urged Burrus and me
1967,_NERO._,To set our honoured oaths and firm allegiance
1968,_NERO._,"To you aside, as being unjustly sworn;                          1060"
1969,_NERO._,"To undo all she has done, and bring Britannicus"
1970,_NERO._,Back to the people as Rome’s rightful heir?
1971,_NERO._,
1972,_NERO._,"_Ner._ I knew this, Seneca; and if ’twere meant,"
1973,_NERO._,Where lies the danger?
1974,_NERO._,
1975,_NERO._,_Sen._                 True; but then she vows
1976,_NERO._,"Plainly that, rather than resign her power,"
1977,_NERO._,"She will make known her crimes, nor spare herself,"
1978,_NERO._,If in the implication of her ruin
1979,_NERO._,She may involve us too. Know you of that?
1980,_NERO._,
1981,_NERO._,_Ner._ She could not mean it.
1982,_NERO._,
1983,_NERO._,_Sen._                        Certainly ’twas in passion
1984,_NERO._,"Spoken, and fury: but ’tis such a thing                         1070"
1985,_NERO._,As might be done in passion.
1986,_NERO._,
1987,_NERO._,_Ner._                       And what says Burrus?
1988,_NERO._,
1989,_NERO._,"_Sen._ He too would urge, as I, the Augusta’s exile."
1990,_NERO._,
1991,_NERO._,_Ner._ Yet must she stay.
1992,_NERO._,
1993,_NERO._,"_Sen._                    Nay, Nero, she must go."
1994,_NERO._,
1995,_NERO._,"_Ner._ I bade thee, Seneca, to counsel me:"
1996,_NERO._,Call’st thou this counsel? ’Tis in the exigence
1997,_NERO._,Of such affairs that their necessity
1998,_NERO._,Precludes the true decision: this thou’st taught me:
1999,_NERO._,And that the man of counsel is but he
2000,_NERO._,"Who handles best the circumstance, most gently"
2001,_NERO._,"Resolves the knot, not cuts it. In this difficulty"
2002,_NERO._,Is there no course?                                             1081
2003,_NERO._,
2004,_NERO._,_Sen._              I go not back from this;
2005,_NERO._,If both remain there’s none.
2006,_NERO._,
2007,_NERO._,_Ner._                       Is my life threatened?
2008,_NERO._,
2009,_NERO._,_Sen._ Ay.
2010,_NERO._,
2011,_NERO._,"_Ner._     Then Britannicus must go, and shall go,"
2012,_NERO._,As first I purposed.
2013,_NERO._,
2014,_NERO._,_Sen._               Whither will you send him?
2015,_NERO._,
2016,_NERO._,_Ner._ Far out of hearing of his claim. ’Tis not
2017,_NERO._,A trifling matter.
2018,_NERO._,
2019,_NERO._,_Sen._             See now to the other extreme
2020,_NERO._,How you o’erleap the mean from wrong to wrong!
2021,_NERO._,
2022,_NERO._,_Ner._ Such wrongs the title of my power condones.
2023,_NERO._,Shall I at the outset of a world-wide policy
2024,_NERO._,"Stick at a household scruple, and for fear                      1090"
2025,_NERO._,To do a private wrong forfeit the power
2026,_NERO._,Which makes me Cæsar? See my glory trip
2027,_NERO._,At a little ill because I will not level
2028,_NERO._,My safety with the welfare of the world?
2029,_NERO._,
2030,_NERO._,"_Sen._ But what you must not, that you cannot do."
2031,_NERO._,
2032,_NERO._,"_Ner._ Rather what Cæsar must do, that he may."
2033,_NERO._,Rome understands not empire yet: we learned
2034,_NERO._,Something of Herod.
2035,_NERO._,
2036,_NERO._,"_Sen._              O the injustice, Nero!"
2037,_NERO._,The wrong! How! Will you sooner spill a life
2038,_NERO._,"So innocent, your creditor in kindness,                         1100"
2039,_NERO._,"Than do disgrace to another, one so guilty"
2040,_NERO._,"As to deserve, sinking all exigency,"
2041,_NERO._,The fearful penalty you now misplace?
2042,_NERO._,Think twice.
2043,_NERO._,
2044,_NERO._,"_Ner._       Why, if I think of it again,"
2045,_NERO._,Is not thy error fourfold more than mine?
2046,_NERO._,"This need is granted to all tyrannies,"
2047,_NERO._,"To slay pretenders, ay, and most of all"
2048,_NERO._,"Those of the family: but for a mother,"
2049,_NERO._,The very Persian or the unrivalled Jew
2050,_NERO._,Would shrink from her dishonour.                                1110
2051,_NERO._,
2052,_NERO._,_Sen._ (_aside_).       What to say?
2053,_NERO._,Being out of kinship ’twere the lesser blot—
2054,_NERO._,Yet there’s his innocence. Necessity
2055,_NERO._,Cannot suborn morality so far
2056,_NERO._,"As such confusion,—nor the alternative"
2057,_NERO._,"May yet be shunned,—and when the best is wrong..."
2058,_NERO._,
2059,_NERO._,_Ner._ What thinkest thou?
2060,_NERO._,
2061,_NERO._,_Sen._                     Wait: it shall be my office
2062,_NERO._,To find some better means.
2063,_NERO._,
2064,_NERO._,_Ner._                     ’Twill be thine office
2065,_NERO._,To show in such a speech as I may make
2066,_NERO._,"After his death, that, howsoe’er he died,—"
2067,_NERO._,"Which you shall know no more than shall my hearers,—"
2068,_NERO._,’Twas for the general good.                                     1121
2069,_NERO._,
2070,_NERO._,"_Sen._                      Be counselled, Nero."
2071,_NERO._,This is not my advice.
2072,_NERO._,
2073,_NERO._,_Ner._                 Thou offerest none
2074,_NERO._,Which can be taken.
2075,_NERO._,
2076,_NERO._,"_Sen._              See, I have brought your speech"
2077,_NERO._,Touching the Parthian war.
2078,_NERO._,
2079,_NERO._,_Ner._                     ’Tis long.

2081,_NERO._,_Sen._                                The matter
2082,_NERO._,"Being very weighty, ’twill be looked for from you"
2083,_NERO._,"To say thus much: but if it seem too long,"
2084,_NERO._,"’Tis so composed that with these brackets here,"
2085,_NERO._,"Skipped as you list, the speech is any length."
2086,_NERO._,
2087,_NERO._,_Ner._ I thank thee. I shall need that other speech.
2088,_NERO._,
2089,_NERO._,_Sen._ I pray you may not need it. My advice                  1130
2090,_NERO._,Is wait.
2091,_NERO._,
2092,_NERO._,"_Ner._  Is it? Stay—Seneca, dost thou think"
2093,_NERO._,My mother was in earnest when she urged
2094,_NERO._,Treason on thee and Burrus? And dost thou think
2095,_NERO._,She fooled me in saying that she made proposal
2096,_NERO._,To Burrus but to sound his honesty?
2097,_NERO._,
2098,_NERO._,_Sen._ Eh! with that tale she took you?
2099,_NERO._,
2100,_NERO._,_Ner._                                  Is’t not true?
2101,_NERO._,
2102,_NERO._,_Sen._ That true!
2103,_NERO._,
2104,_NERO._,_Ner._            She was in earnest though in passion?
2105,_NERO._,Answer me.
2106,_NERO._,
2107,_NERO._,"_Sen._      Ay, she was."
2108,_NERO._,
2109,_NERO._,_Ner._                   I pray thee leave me.
2110,_NERO._,I shall not wait.       [_Exit Seneca._
2111,_NERO._,I stand alone. Such officers as share                           1140
2112,_NERO._,The functions of tyrannic government
2113,_NERO._,Cannot be looked to for a policy
2114,_NERO._,Of personal security; they lack
2115,_NERO._,The motive that abates the fear of crime.
2116,_NERO._,"Britannicus must go, and ’tis my hand"
2117,_NERO._,Must aim his death. I have a medicine
2118,_NERO._,"Which he must drink for me, to save my life."
2119,_NERO._,"To-night shall do it. But for my other enemy,"
2120,_NERO._,"My mother, who with such dissimulation"
2121,_NERO._,"Won me, spite of foreknowledge of her deeds,                    1150"
2122,_NERO._,And judgment of her purpose—Ha! indeed;
2123,_NERO._,"Seneca’s laughing-stock! Now, what I do"
2124,_NERO._,Will much surprise her. If it kill her hope
2125,_NERO._,"And prove my temper towards her, ’twill be well."

2244,_SELEUCUS._,"_Sel._                 Ay, my lady,"
2245,_SELEUCUS._,I promised her two Cæsars.
2246,_SELEUCUS._,
2247,_SELEUCUS._,_Dom._                     Two! how two?
2248,_SELEUCUS._,
2249,_SELEUCUS._,_Sel._ A secret that of art; our divination
2250,_SELEUCUS._,Hath many such. The gods are favourable.
2251,_SELEUCUS._,
2252,_SELEUCUS._,_Dom._ Talk not to me of gods. One was enough;
2253,_SELEUCUS._,Yet the other matters not. Two Cæsars indeed!
2254,_SELEUCUS._,"Most favourable gods!—See, here I give you"

2378,_OTHO._,
2379,_OTHO._,"_Oth._ ’Tis death, ’tis death. I speak now but for thee:"

2381,_OTHO._,To quit thy place thou too wilt come to taste.
2382,_OTHO._,
2383,_OTHO._,_Pop._ That is my risk. The sport were tame without it:

2385,_OTHO._,
2386,_OTHO._,_Oth._                      Weigh well the danger:
2387,_OTHO._,Think of it thus; to live on a caprice
2388,_OTHO._,Whose jealousy is death; where for the reason
2389,_OTHO._,One seems to love thee will be ten to hate thee;
2390,_OTHO._,Where not to be beforehand with a treachery
2391,_OTHO._,Is to be victim.
2392,_OTHO._,
2393,_OTHO._,_Pop._           I can steer my way.
2394,_OTHO._,
2395,_OTHO._,_Oth._ And for this desperate venture wilt cast off
2396,_OTHO._,"My love, our love?"
2397,_OTHO._,
2398,_OTHO._,_Pop._             What is love?
2399,_OTHO._,
2400,_OTHO._,_Oth._                           Art thou Poppæa?
2401,_OTHO._,"Wer’t any else but thou that questioned thus,"
2402,_OTHO._,My answer then were ready: I should say
2403,_OTHO._,"Ask of Poppæa, ’tis the thing she knows;                        1270"
2404,_OTHO._,"Ask Otho’s wife what love is, she can tell."
2405,_OTHO._,And thou to ask! as if ’twere some strange matter
2406,_OTHO._,"Wide of experience, and to ask of me"
2407,_OTHO._,Who won thee for my teacher!
2408,_OTHO._,
2409,_OTHO._,_Pop._                       ’Tis true the impeachment
2410,_OTHO._,I make of love is that he hath exhausted
2411,_OTHO._,His treasure rather than denied us aught.
2412,_OTHO._,
2413,_OTHO._,_Oth._ Exhausted love! how mean you?
2414,_OTHO._,
2415,_OTHO._,_Pop._                               See! I am made
2416,_OTHO._,Of other stuff and passions besides love.
2417,_OTHO._,You cannot wish that all my life should move
2418,_OTHO._,"Pent in this narrow circle, day by day                          1280"
2419,_OTHO._,Keeping the pretty game up which I learned
2420,_OTHO._,When I was green: that I should ne’er do else
2421,_OTHO._,"Than this one thing, and that so constantly"
2422,_OTHO._,That even the habit and the practice of it
2423,_OTHO._,"Are scarce employment; that I should grow grey,"
2424,_OTHO._,And see the wide and seasonable field
2425,_OTHO._,Of life’s exertion and excitement fallow
2426,_OTHO._,With this one weed of love?
2427,_OTHO._,
2428,_OTHO._,"_Oth._                      A weed, you say!"
2429,_OTHO._,
2430,_OTHO._,_Pop._ I have other motions in me. I’ve an itch
2431,_OTHO._,"Men call ambition, and I see a prize                            1290"
2432,_OTHO._,Looks worth the having.
2433,_OTHO._,
2434,_OTHO._,_Oth._                  ’Tis not worth the having.
2435,_OTHO._,
2436,_OTHO._,"_Pop._ Why, what were I to thee, could’st thou be Cæsar?"

2438,_OTHO._,_Oth._ Even all thou art; I have no itch to rule
2439,_OTHO._,"Merely to see that game played out, and cry"
2440,_OTHO._,At the end—what is ambition?
2441,_OTHO._,
2442,_OTHO._,_Pop._                        It hath no end.
2443,_OTHO._,

2450,_OTHO._,
2451,_OTHO._,_Pop._ I thought your eye was open to perceive
2452,_OTHO._,The grandeur of my scheme.
2453,_OTHO._,
2454,_OTHO._,_Oth._                     Thou wert mistaken.

2457,_OTHO._,"I have no secrets from you: if I prosper,"
2458,_OTHO._,"Desert me if you will, but blame me not:"
2459,_OTHO._,For dared I combat Cæsar’s inclination
2460,_OTHO._,There were as much to lose. The thing I do
2461,_OTHO._,Will be your safety.
2462,_OTHO._,
2463,_OTHO._,"_Oth._               Rather would I die,"
2464,_OTHO._,"Ay, rather far that thou should’st die than do"
2465,_OTHO._,This baseness willingly.
2466,_OTHO._,
2467,_OTHO._,"_Pop._                   Nay, speak not so."
2468,_OTHO._,I shall do nothing base.
2469,_OTHO._,
2470,_OTHO._,_Oth._                   Thou must succeed.
2471,_OTHO._,Only before thou goest I’ll kiss thee once.      [_Kisses Pop._

2474,_OTHO._,_Pop._                      Good night. I go.
2475,_OTHO._,"Lesbia, my cloak! I shall have news ere morn.      [_Exit._"
2476,_OTHO._,
2477,_OTHO._,_Oth._ Gone! With a grace
2478,_OTHO._,"As firm, as pleasant, gay and self-possessed"
2479,_OTHO._,As that with which she hath come a thousand times
2480,_OTHO._,"To meet me, kiss me, and call me hers, she goes"
2481,_OTHO._,To change her husband .. gone! and not a sign
2482,_OTHO._,To show that leaving me was losing aught!
2483,_OTHO._,"Fool that I was! To the soul I knew her vain,"
2484,_OTHO._,"Self-seeking, light, petulant at the breath"
2485,_OTHO._,"Of contradiction, and yet I trusted. What,                      1320"
2486,_OTHO._,"Asks she, is love. Ay, what? I love my dog;"
2487,_OTHO._,"He is devoted beyond reason, pitiful"
2488,_OTHO._,In his dependence; he will scarce reproach me
2489,_OTHO._,"With some short wondering sorrow, if I strike him—"
2490,_OTHO._,"I love my horse; he bears me willingly,"
2491,_OTHO._,Answering spiritedly; with all his strength
2492,_OTHO._,"Generous and gentle. But woman, if man love her,—"
2493,_OTHO._,"Seeing she is less devoted than the hound,"
2494,_OTHO._,"Less noble than the horse,—’tis that we deem,"
2495,_OTHO._,That being human she can gauge the worth                        1330
2496,_OTHO._,"Of our intensity, and in kind somewhat"
2497,_OTHO._,"Repay it: ’tis a delusion; spite of shew,"
2498,_OTHO._,She hath not in her heart that which her eyes
2499,_OTHO._,Fondly declare. There is no passion possible
2500,_OTHO._,Which beauty can interpret or soft speech
2501,_OTHO._,"Express, which was not mine; ay, by that title"
2502,_OTHO._,O’er and o’er; yet I think no dog in Rome
2503,_OTHO._,"Would leave the meanest slave that fed him once,"
2504,_OTHO._,As hath this woman left the man that loved her.

2521,_PETRONIUS._,"You see the matter, maybe have foreseen it;"
2522,_PETRONIUS._,I was too blind. Spare me your condolence;

2764,_OCTAVIA._,"_Br._ (_reads_). _Britannicus, sup not to-day with Cæsar._"
2765,_OCTAVIA._,How came you by it?
2766,_OCTAVIA._,
2767,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._              ’Tis from Fulvia,"
2768,_OCTAVIA._,The maid that loves Seleucus; whence ’tis his.
2769,_OCTAVIA._,
2770,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._ Most like; I know the turbaned mountebank
2771,_OCTAVIA._,"Keeps an old kindness for me. Yet nay, nay—                     1500"
2772,_OCTAVIA._,"If this should now be found—nay, he’s too shrewd"
2773,_OCTAVIA._,To put himself in writing.
2774,_OCTAVIA._,
2775,_OCTAVIA._,_Oct._                     He might dare
2776,_OCTAVIA._,With Fulvia.
2777,_OCTAVIA._,
2778,_OCTAVIA._,_Br._        Nay. I cannot think ’tis his.
2779,_OCTAVIA._,"And were it, what’s his credit? I do not trust"
2780,_OCTAVIA._,"These fellows far. They trade in mystery,"
2781,_OCTAVIA._,"And love to thicken water,—and if there be"
2782,_OCTAVIA._,"A plot to poison me, to-day’s occasion"
2783,_OCTAVIA._,Offers no easier vantage than to-morrow’s.
2784,_OCTAVIA._,My safety lies elsewhere.
2785,_OCTAVIA._,
2786,_OCTAVIA._,_Oct._                    O do not go.
2787,_OCTAVIA._,
2788,_OCTAVIA._,"_Br._ Fear not, Octavia, I am very careful,                   1510"
2789,_OCTAVIA._,"And eat but sparingly of any dish,"
2790,_OCTAVIA._,Nor aught but what goes round. To stay away
2791,_OCTAVIA._,"Might show suspicion, and could serve no end."
2792,_OCTAVIA._,
2793,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._ Brother, be warned, go not to-night; to-morrow"
2794,_OCTAVIA._,We may learn more. I beg...
2795,_OCTAVIA._,
2796,_OCTAVIA._,"_Br._                        Nay, urge me not,"
2797,_OCTAVIA._,Since with this warning I am doubly safe.
2798,_OCTAVIA._,
2799,_OCTAVIA._,"_Oct._ Oh, I dread Nero’s anger; ’tis most certain"
2800,_OCTAVIA._,That ill will come of it.
2801,_OCTAVIA._,
2802,_OCTAVIA._,"_Br._                     Nay, fear him not."
2803,_OCTAVIA._,"Let us go sup. I will use all precaution,                       1519"
2804,_OCTAVIA._,"Thou may’st be sure, since for thy sake I do it:"
2805,_OCTAVIA._,And while thou livest I shall have both reason
2806,_OCTAVIA._,"And wish to live. Have care, too, for thyself;"
2807,_OCTAVIA._,I think thy peril is no less than mine.      [_Exeunt._

2824,_NERO._,
2825,_NERO._,I will propose a question to the table:
2826,_NERO._,"Which of the arts is greatest? Lucan, these sausages"
2827,_NERO._,Are something new: try them.
2828,_NERO._,
2829,_POPPÆA._,_POPPÆA._
2830,_POPPÆA._,
2831,_POPPÆA._,"You question, Cæsar,"
2832,_POPPÆA._,Which of the arts is greatest? I would answer
2833,_POPPÆA._,The one which Cæsar honours.
2834,_POPPÆA._,
2835,_TIGELLINUS._,_TIGELLINUS._
2836,_TIGELLINUS._,
2837,_TIGELLINUS._,But if Cæsar
2838,_TIGELLINUS._,Should honour more than one?

2841,_PETRONIUS._,
2842,_PETRONIUS._,The sausages                       1529
2843,_PETRONIUS._,"Are good enough. As for the arts, here’s Lucan"
2844,_PETRONIUS._,Can speak for poetry.
2845,_PETRONIUS._,
2846,_PETRONIUS._,_Ner._                If any man
2847,_PETRONIUS._,"Could prove one art beyond contention first,"
2848,_PETRONIUS._,I would reward him excellently. With me
2849,_PETRONIUS._,To know the best and follow it are one:
2850,_PETRONIUS._,"Success being easy in all, my difficulty"
2851,_PETRONIUS._,"Lies in distraction: show me then the best,"
2852,_PETRONIUS._,I’ll perfect that.
2853,_PETRONIUS._,
2854,_PETRONIUS._,_Pop._             What! Cæsar give up singing?
2855,_PETRONIUS._,
2856,_PETRONIUS._,_Ner._ For better things.
2857,_PETRONIUS._,
2858,_PETRONIUS._,_Tig._                    Which be the arts?
2859,_PETRONIUS._,
2860,_PETRONIUS._,"_Petr._ (_to servants_).                     Here, vermin,"
2861,_PETRONIUS._,This wine’s half-way to vinegar.
2862,_PETRONIUS._,
2863,_PETRONIUS._,_Ner._                           Who will name
2864,_PETRONIUS._,"The arts? There’s sculpture, painting, poetry,                  1540"
2865,_PETRONIUS._,Singing..
2866,_PETRONIUS._,
2867,_PARIS._,_PARIS._
2868,_PARIS._,
2869,_PARIS._,And acting.
2870,_PARIS._,
2871,_PARIS._,"_Ner._                  Well, what more?"
2872,_PARIS._,
2873,_PARIS._,_Tig._                                   Horse-racing.
2874,_PARIS._,
2875,_PARIS._,_Pop._ (_across_). Ruling I think’s an art.
2876,_PARIS._,
2877,_PARIS._,_AGRIPPINA_ (_across_).
2878,_PARIS._,
2879,_PARIS._,And making love.
2880,_PARIS._,
2881,_PARIS._,_Ner._ ’Tis of the fine arts we would speak.
2882,_PARIS._,"(_To servants_) Ho! fellows,"
2883,_PARIS._,"Pour out the wine! Ah, here’s a lovely mullet."
2884,_PARIS._,Has this been tasted?
2885,_PARIS._,
2886,_TASTER._,_TASTER._
2887,_TASTER._,
2888,_TASTER._,"Ay, Cæsar. ’Tis stuffed with truffles."
2889,_TASTER._,
2890,_TASTER._,"_Ner_. A mullet stuffed with truffles. Now, Poppæa,"
2891,_TASTER._,Will not this please?
2892,_TASTER._,
2893,_TASTER._,"_Pop._                I thank you.—(_aside_) Prithee, bid"
2894,_TASTER._,Lucan to speak for poetry.
2895,_TASTER._,
2896,_TASTER._,_BRITANNICUS_ (_to servant_).
2897,_TASTER._,
2898,_TASTER._,"Nay, the mullet."
2899,_TASTER._,
2900,_TASTER._,"_Ner._ Lucan, what say you for your art?"
2901,_TASTER._,
2902,_LUCAN._,_LUCAN._
2903,_LUCAN._,
2904,_LUCAN._,I claim
2905,_LUCAN._,"The first place for it, and I say ’tis proved                   1550"
2906,_LUCAN._,Nobler than any plastic art in this;
2907,_LUCAN._,"It needs not tools nor gross material,"
2908,_LUCAN._,"And hath twin doors to the mind, both eye and ear."
2909,_LUCAN._,"Nay, even of drama Aristotle held,"
2910,_LUCAN._,"Though a good play must act well, that ’tis perfect"
2911,_LUCAN._,Without the stage: which shows that poetry
2912,_LUCAN._,Stains not her excellence by being kind
2913,_LUCAN._,"To those encumbrances, which, in my judgment,"
2914,_LUCAN._,Are pushed to fetter fancy.—Then hath our art
2915,_LUCAN._,Such strong and universal mastery                               1560
2916,_LUCAN._,"O’er heart and mind, that here ’tis only music"
2917,_LUCAN._,"Competes, and she is second far in scope,"
2918,_LUCAN._,"Directness, and distinction."
2919,_LUCAN._,
2920,_LUCAN._,_Ner._                       You think that?
2921,_LUCAN._,
2922,_LUCAN._,"_Luc._ Ay, Cæsar."
2923,_LUCAN._,
2924,_LUCAN._,_Ner._            Do you! you who have ever been
2925,_LUCAN._,More gracious to my voice than to my pen!
2926,_LUCAN._,"Am I a better singer then than poet,"
2927,_LUCAN._,Think you?
2928,_LUCAN._,
2929,_LUCAN._,"_Luc._     Nay, Cæsar; but...."
2930,_LUCAN._,
2931,_LUCAN._,_Ner._                         Ha! then you are envious.
2932,_LUCAN._,"You would not have me write because, forsooth,"
2933,_LUCAN._,"You write yourself. Now, by the god, I swear"
2934,_LUCAN._,Thou shalt not publish nor recite a verse                       1570
2935,_LUCAN._,Within my empire till I give thee leave.
2936,_LUCAN._,One man to keep the muses to himself!
2937,_LUCAN._,Monstrous!
2938,_LUCAN._,
2939,_LUCAN._,_Pop._  And serve him right.
2940,_LUCAN._,
2941,_LUCAN._,_Luc._ (_aside_).     Monstrous indeed!
2942,_LUCAN._,
2943,_LUCAN._,_Ner._ (_to servants_). Heat me some wine.
2944,_LUCAN._,"Come, lords, ye drink not. Eh! what have we here?"
2945,_LUCAN._,
2946,_LUCAN._,"_Servant._ Cherubim, Cæsar."
2947,_LUCAN._,
2948,_LUCAN._,_Ner._                      What is Cherubim?
2949,_LUCAN._,
2950,_LUCAN._,_Petr._ The gods of the Jews.
2951,_LUCAN._,
2952,_LUCAN._,_Ner._                        Hoo! let us eat their gods.
2953,_LUCAN._,They are much like pheasants.
2954,_LUCAN._,
2955,_LUCAN._,"_Servt._                      ’Tis a pheasant, Cæsar,"
2956,_LUCAN._,And stuffed with woodcock.
2957,_LUCAN._,
2958,_LUCAN._,"_Petr._                    Cæsar, there’s one art"
2959,_LUCAN._,Has not been mentioned; though I think at table
2960,_LUCAN._,It should not be passed o’er.                                   1581
2961,_LUCAN._,
2962,_LUCAN._,_Ner._                        What art is that?
2963,_LUCAN._,
2964,_LUCAN._,_Petr._ I shall contend it is the first of all.
2965,_LUCAN._,
2966,_LUCAN._,_Ner._ Name it.
2967,_LUCAN._,
2968,_LUCAN._,_Petr._         It hath no name. It scarce exists.
2969,_LUCAN._,I think the goddess never walked the earth.
2970,_LUCAN._,
2971,_LUCAN._,_Par._ Ranks she with poetry?
2972,_LUCAN._,
2973,_LUCAN._,_Petr._                       I avouch above.
2974,_LUCAN._,
2975,_LUCAN._,"_Par._ Cæsar, if this be proved, thou must rescind"
2976,_LUCAN._,Thy poet’s sentence.
2977,_LUCAN._,
2978,_LUCAN._,_Ner._               Let him prove it first.
2979,_LUCAN._,
2980,_LUCAN._,_Petr._ I see in other arts some wit or fancy
2981,_LUCAN._,Extrinsical to nature. I can find
2982,_LUCAN._,"No ground of need in any, save maybe                            1590"
2983,_LUCAN._,"In architecture,—which ranks not so well"
2984,_LUCAN._,"As to be mentioned by you.—Now, if I"
2985,_LUCAN._,Show you an art whose matter every day
2986,_LUCAN._,"Is life’s necessity, which gives more scope"
2987,_LUCAN._,"To skill than any other, which delights"
2988,_LUCAN._,Among the senses one which the other arts
2989,_LUCAN._,"Wholly neglect, would you not say this art"
2990,_LUCAN._,"Hath the first claim? See, I could live without"
2991,_LUCAN._,"The joys of harmony, colour, or form,"
2992,_LUCAN._,But without this it were impossible                             1600
2993,_LUCAN._,To outlast the week.
2994,_LUCAN._,
2995,_LUCAN._,_Par._               Oh! Cookery.
2996,_LUCAN._,
2997,_LUCAN._,"_Several._                        Cookery, cookery!"
2998,_LUCAN._,
2999,_LUCAN._,_Petr._ There’s the mistake I gird at. None of you
3000,_LUCAN._,"But thinks this art I speak of, which includes"
3001,_LUCAN._,"Pleasures of entertainment, ease and elegance,"
3002,_LUCAN._,"The mind’s best recreation, the satisfaction"
3003,_LUCAN._,"Of the body’s nearest needs, the preservation"
3004,_LUCAN._,"Of health, and with all this, the gratifying"
3005,_LUCAN._,"Of that one sense, which above all the senses"
3006,_LUCAN._,"Is subtle, difficult, discerning, ticklish,"
3007,_LUCAN._,"And most importunate,—that this great art                       1610"
3008,_LUCAN._,Is a cook’s province.
3009,_LUCAN._,
3010,_LUCAN._,"_Ner._                True, Petronius, true;"
3011,_LUCAN._,There’s room for bettering these things.
3012,_LUCAN._,
3013,_LUCAN._,"_Petr._                                  Why, wine—"
3014,_LUCAN._,Just think of wine. A hundred vintages
3015,_LUCAN._,Lie in my cellar; by my taste I tell
3016,_LUCAN._,Each one; are eye or ear so delicate?
3017,_LUCAN._,
3018,_LUCAN._,_Par._ Here’s half a case already.
3019,_LUCAN._,
3020,_LUCAN._,"_Petr._                            Then again,"
3021,_LUCAN._,Look on this side. You bid your friends to supper:
3022,_LUCAN._,That is a promise; and hath all your life
3023,_LUCAN._,An hour more suitable for skilful kindness?                     1619
3024,_LUCAN._,"They come perturbed, fatigued, hungry and thirsty;"
3025,_LUCAN._,"Nature exhausts them for you, drains them empty"
3026,_LUCAN._,To take all kinds of pleasure; their grated nerves
3027,_LUCAN._,"Ask music, their wearied limbs soft cushioned couches,"
3028,_LUCAN._,"Their harassed mind wise cheerful conversation,"
3029,_LUCAN._,Their body’s appetites fawn at the word
3030,_LUCAN._,"Of food and wine: and yet we see these things,"
3031,_LUCAN._,"Which should be studied, ordered, suited, measured,"
3032,_LUCAN._,"All jumbled in confusion, till a feast,"
3033,_LUCAN._,"Instead of relaxation and renewal,"
3034,_LUCAN._,"Becomes, I say, for body and for mind                           1630"
3035,_LUCAN._,The worst discomfort and the stiffest trial
3036,_LUCAN._,That life can show.
3037,_LUCAN._,
3038,_LUCAN._,_Par._              Bravo! bravo!
3039,_LUCAN._,
3040,_LUCAN._,"_Ner._                            For one,"
3041,_LUCAN._,I am converted. Thou shalt be henceforth
3042,_LUCAN._,Arbiter of my table.
3043,_LUCAN._,
3044,_LUCAN._,_Br._ (_to servt._) ’Tis boiling hot;
3045,_LUCAN._,Taste it.
3046,_LUCAN._,
3047,_LUCAN._,_Ner._ (_to Petron._) Accept you the office?
3048,_LUCAN._,
3049,_LUCAN._,_Petr._                                 This would make me
3050,_LUCAN._,A Cæsar above Cæsar.
3051,_LUCAN._,
3052,_LUCAN._,_Ner._               In the province
3053,_LUCAN._,Of imperial æsthetics.
3054,_LUCAN._,
3055,_LUCAN._,"_Servt. to Brit._      Pardon, your highness,"
3056,_LUCAN._,I will add water to it: ’tis yet unmixed.
3057,_LUCAN._,
3058,_LUCAN._,[_They pour in the poison._
3059,_LUCAN._,
3060,_LUCAN._,"_Petr._ ’Twill be a tyranny. For look, I hold"
3061,_LUCAN._,Man’s stomach is not to be trifled with.                        1640
3062,_LUCAN._,Not only should your table give delight
3063,_LUCAN._,"Even to the ravishment of every palate,"
3064,_LUCAN._,But since the end and final cause of food
3065,_LUCAN._,"Is not to breed diseases in the flesh,"
3066,_LUCAN._,"Nor heat the spirits more than they can bear,"
3067,_LUCAN._,"But rather to build up and comfort health,"
3068,_LUCAN._,I’d order first that there be served at table
3069,_LUCAN._,Nothing but what is wholesome.
3070,_LUCAN._,
3071,_LUCAN._,_Br._ (_after drinking nubile Petr. speaks_). Ah!
3072,_LUCAN._,
3073,_LUCAN._,[_Falls back._
3074,_LUCAN._,
3075,_LUCAN._,"_Oct._ The wine, the wine!"

3078,_LUCAN._,
3079,_LUCAN._,_Oct._ He is dead. O dead! O dead!                            1650
3080,_LUCAN._,
3081,_LUCAN._,"_Lucan, Petronius and Paris go to Britannicus."
3082,_LUCAN._,Domitia follows.—All rising._
3083,_LUCAN._,
3084,_LUCAN._,_Agr._ What is this?
3085,_LUCAN._,
3086,_LUCAN._,_Ner._               He hath a fit.
3087,_LUCAN._,
3088,_LUCAN._,_Petr._                             He doth not breathe.
3089,_LUCAN._,
3090,_LUCAN._,"_Oct._ (_has come round to front_). Alas, alas! my brother; he is"
3091,_LUCAN._,dead.
3092,_LUCAN._,
3093,_LUCAN._,"_Ner._ Nay, sit you down; look not aghast, I say."
3094,_LUCAN._,"He hath the falling sickness, and will oft"
3095,_LUCAN._,"Faint on a sudden, as ye see. He lies"
3096,_LUCAN._,"An hour as dead, and then awakes again"
3097,_LUCAN._,With nought amiss. Best take him out in quiet.
3098,_LUCAN._,(_To servants._) Carry him from the room.
3099,_LUCAN._,
3100,_LUCAN._,"_Luc._                               Lift you his feet, Petronius."
3101,_LUCAN._,We two will take him.
3102,_LUCAN._,
3103,_LUCAN._,"_Ner._                Let him be, I say.                      1660"
3104,_LUCAN._,His servants will attend him. Return to table:
3105,_LUCAN._,We cannot spare you.
3106,_LUCAN._,
3107,_LUCAN._,"_Par._ (_to Oct._)          Honoured lady, be hopeful:"
3108,_LUCAN._,For hath your noble brother e’er been taken
3109,_LUCAN._,"Like this, he may recover."
3110,_LUCAN._,
3111,_LUCAN._,_Oct._ (_to Par._)  Never—
3112,_LUCAN._,Never! O never! he is dead! I knew it!      [_Going._
3113,_LUCAN._,
3114,_LUCAN._,"_Ner._ (_to Oct._) Heh, sit you down. What could you do, I pray?"
3115,_LUCAN._,He will come round.
3116,_LUCAN._,
3117,_LUCAN._,_Oct._              Oh! I will follow him.
3118,_LUCAN._,
3119,_LUCAN._,[_Exit with servants who are carrying Brit._
3120,_LUCAN._,
3121,_LUCAN._,_Petr._ (_to Par._) How happened it?
3122,_LUCAN._,

3124,_LUCAN._,"Fresh mixed, and then fell back just as you saw."
3125,_LUCAN._,What think you?
3126,_LUCAN._,
3127,_LUCAN._,_Petr._ (_to Par._) Think you ’twas aught?                    1670
3128,_LUCAN._,
3129,_LUCAN._,_Par._ (_to Luc._)                         What think you?
3130,_LUCAN._,
3131,_LUCAN._,_Luc._ Impossible.
3132,_LUCAN._,
3133,_LUCAN._,_Dom._ (_aside_). He is poisoned. Yet my sister
3134,_LUCAN._,Was nothing privy to it. She is pale.
3135,_LUCAN._,
3136,_LUCAN._,"_Ner._ Come, sit you down, aunt: come, Petronius,"
3137,_LUCAN._,"Lucan, be seated. Let not the horrid sight"
3138,_LUCAN._,Unwhet your appetites.
3139,_LUCAN._,
3140,_LUCAN._,_Petr._ (_to Luc._)    That was no fit.      [_To Par._
3141,_LUCAN._,He is dead. What if ’twere poison? Where’s the drink?
3142,_LUCAN._,
3143,_LUCAN._,_Par._ ’Twas hurried out.
3144,_LUCAN._,
3145,_LUCAN._,_Luc._                    O God!
3146,_LUCAN._,
3147,_LUCAN._,_Ner._ (_to servts._)     Serve out the wine.
3148,_LUCAN._,We all must need a bumper; ’tis most natural.
3149,_LUCAN._,I have known the mere revulsion to provoke
3150,_LUCAN._,In a strong man a seizure similar                               1680
3151,_LUCAN._,To that which frighted him.
3152,_LUCAN._,
3153,_LUCAN._,"_Par._ (_aside_).    ’Twould not amaze me,"

3156,_LUCAN._,_Pop._ (_to Nero_).      I will not drink.
3157,_LUCAN._,
3158,_LUCAN._,_Ner._ From my cup.
3159,_LUCAN._,
3160,_LUCAN._,"_Pop._              Well, from thine.      [_Drinks._"
3161,_LUCAN._,
3162,_LUCAN._,_Luc._ (_aside_).              He is self-betrayed.

3165,_LUCAN._,
3166,_LUCAN._,_Petr._               At the point where Cæsar made me
3167,_LUCAN._,Arbiter of his table. I shall ask
3168,_LUCAN._,To inaugurate my office.
3169,_LUCAN._,
3170,_LUCAN._,"_Ner._                   Do so, Petronius."
3171,_LUCAN._,
3172,_LUCAN._,"_Petr._ Then know you are all dismissed. Let all go home,"
3173,_LUCAN._,And for the prince’s safety offer up      [_All rise._
3174,_LUCAN._,"What vows ye may unto the gods. Myself,"
3175,_LUCAN._,"I set the example, and go first. Come, Lucan.      [_Going._"

3198,_THRASEA._,
3199,_THRASEA._,’Tis well we meet.
3200,_THRASEA._,How went it in the senate?
3201,_THRASEA._,
3202,_THRASEA._,_Pr._                      As you said.
3203,_THRASEA._,A message read from Nero.
3204,_THRASEA._,
3205,_THRASEA._,_Thr._                    Seneca?
3206,_THRASEA._,
3207,_THRASEA._,_Pr._ No doubt.

3209,_THRASEA._,_Thr._ And in what terms touched he the murder?
3210,_THRASEA._,
3211,_THRASEA._,"_Pr._ With double tongue, as being an ill which none,"
3212,_THRASEA._,"And Cæsar least, could have desired; and yet"
3213,_THRASEA._,A good none should lament.
3214,_THRASEA._,
3215,_THRASEA._,_Thr._                     He is very prompt.                 1700
3216,_THRASEA._,What glozing for the hasty burial?
3217,_THRASEA._,
3218,_THRASEA._,_Pr._ The speech was thus; that ’twas the better custom
3219,_THRASEA._,Of simple times to shun all vain parade:
3220,_THRASEA._,"That private grief was mocked by frigid pomp,"
3221,_THRASEA._,And public business and quiet thereby
3222,_THRASEA._,"Idly disturbed;—_Then for myself_, it ran,"
3223,_THRASEA._,_To have lost the aid and comfort of a brother
3224,_THRASEA._,Demands your sympathy. Of your goodwill
3225,_THRASEA._,I make no doubt; the more that my misfortune
3226,_THRASEA._,"Throws me upon it, seeing that all my hopes                     1710"
3227,_THRASEA._,Now anchor wholly on the commonwealth.
3228,_THRASEA._,"Wherefore to you, my lords, and to the people,"
3229,_THRASEA._,I look so much the more for maintenance
3230,_THRASEA._,"And favour, since I now am left alone"
3231,_THRASEA._,"Of all my family, to bear the cares"
3232,_THRASEA._,Your empire throws upon me._
3233,_THRASEA._,
3234,_THRASEA._,_Thr._                       This was well.
3235,_THRASEA._,
3236,_THRASEA._,_Pr._ Then were there gifts decreed to all his friends.
3237,_THRASEA._,
3238,_THRASEA._,_Thr._ Hush-money. Did none murmur?
3239,_THRASEA._,
3240,_THRASEA._,_Pr._                               There were none
3241,_THRASEA._,So much as frowned.
3242,_THRASEA._,
3243,_THRASEA._,"_Thr._              See, Lucan! let us speak with him."
3244,_THRASEA._,
3245,_THRASEA._,_Enter Lucan._
3246,_THRASEA._,
3247,_THRASEA._,"If now he be not shaken, I mistake                              1720"

3255,_LUCAN._,
3256,_LUCAN._,_Luc._ Comest thou from the house?
3257,_LUCAN._,
3258,_LUCAN._,"_Thr._                             Nay, more’s the pity."
3259,_LUCAN._,"There was a distribution, as I hear,"
3260,_LUCAN._,"To friends of order. Say, how didst thou fare?"
3261,_LUCAN._,
3262,_LUCAN._,"_Luc._ In many things, Thrasea, I hold not with thee,"
3263,_LUCAN._,Nor will pretend that I can see in virtue
3264,_LUCAN._,A self-sufficiency invulnerable
3265,_LUCAN._,Against the crime of others. I believe
3266,_LUCAN._,"The world is wronged, and burn to avenge the wrong."
3267,_LUCAN._,"But, as an honest man, I take thy hand.                         1730"
3268,_LUCAN._,
3269,_LUCAN._,"_Thr._ I looked for this, Lucan, and take thy hand."
3270,_LUCAN._,Frivolity and crime are most unworthy
3271,_LUCAN._,Of thy companionship.
3272,_LUCAN._,
3273,_LUCAN._,_Luc._                My uncle’s hope
3274,_LUCAN._,"Tainted my judgment. I have been blind, and wronged thee."
3275,_LUCAN._,
3276,_LUCAN._,_Thr._ Where I am misconceived I blame myself.
3277,_LUCAN._,
3278,_LUCAN._,_Luc._ Hear me abjure.
3279,_LUCAN._,
3280,_LUCAN._,_Thr._                 Spare words. There’s no more fear
3281,_LUCAN._,"Thou wilt be duped. Cæsar, in slaying his brother,"
3282,_LUCAN._,Has doffed the mask.
3283,_LUCAN._,
3284,_LUCAN._,_Luc._            The heart of Rome must swell
3285,_LUCAN._,To put the monster down.
3286,_LUCAN._,
3287,_LUCAN._,_Thr._                   We have our part:
3288,_LUCAN._,But in the sorry tragedy he makes                               1740
3289,_LUCAN._,We can be but spectators. On his stage
3290,_LUCAN._,There’s nought but folly. Come thou home with me:

3403,_POPPÆA._,To tell your sister that I willingly
3404,_POPPÆA._,"Retire, if she prevail upon her son"
3405,_POPPÆA._,Quite to forget his love and put me by?
3406,_POPPÆA._,

3427,_POPPÆA._,When Paris brings the news he’ll not believe it.
3428,_POPPÆA._,"But then a word from you might turn the scale,                  1820"

3489,_ATTENDANT._,_ATTENDANT._
3490,_ATTENDANT._,
3491,_ATTENDANT._,"’Tis a good custom, lady,"
3492,_ATTENDANT._,To honour thus the tombs of those we love.
3493,_ATTENDANT._,
3494,_ATTENDANT._,_Oct._ Custom! Is this a custom? Then I think
3495,_ATTENDANT._,I wrong my sorrow in such common shows.
3496,_ATTENDANT._,
3497,_ATTENDANT._,"_Att._ Nay, it doth ease affliction to be busy;"
3498,_ATTENDANT._,"And grief, that cannot reckon with a mystery,                   1850"
3499,_ATTENDANT._,Is comforted by trifles.
3500,_ATTENDANT._,
3501,_ATTENDANT._,"_Oct._                   Why, thou’rt wrong;"
3502,_ATTENDANT._,It brings no comfort.
3503,_ATTENDANT._,
3504,_ATTENDANT._,_Att._                And ’tis kindly done
3505,_ATTENDANT._,To hide the fresh-cut stone. Death is hard featured
3506,_ATTENDANT._,In a new-built tomb.
3507,_ATTENDANT._,
3508,_ATTENDANT._,"_Oct._               O, hold thy peace! I see"
3509,_ATTENDANT._,"Thou canst not be my comforter. Alas,"
3510,_ATTENDANT._,"I blame thee not. But yet, whate’er be said,"
3511,_ATTENDANT._,Think not our gracious deed finds its account
3512,_ATTENDANT._,In the honour done: the wreaths I bring were woven
3513,_ATTENDANT._,"More for myself; the tears I shed, I shed"
3514,_ATTENDANT._,The more abundantly that they are crimes                        1860
3515,_ATTENDANT._,In the sight of him that slew him.
3516,_ATTENDANT._,
3517,_ATTENDANT._,"_Att._                             Speak not so,"
3518,_ATTENDANT._,Lady; thou’rt o’er-distraught.
3519,_ATTENDANT._,
3520,_ATTENDANT._,_Oct._                         What would’st thou have me?
3521,_ATTENDANT._,"Knowing my sorrow thou should’st rather wonder,"
3522,_ATTENDANT._,And think it well that I speak sense at all.
3523,_ATTENDANT._,
3524,_ATTENDANT._,"_Att._ Let not such passion kill thy courage, lady;"
3525,_ATTENDANT._,"The greatest die. There stands the tomb of Julius,"
3526,_ATTENDANT._,Whose mighty march was no less foully stayed
3527,_ATTENDANT._,"At noon of power: there is Augustus’ tomb,"
3528,_ATTENDANT._,Wherein so many lie...
3529,_ATTENDANT._,
3530,_ATTENDANT._,"_Oct._                  Why, what are they"
3531,_ATTENDANT._,To me? Is’t not my brother that is dead?                        1870
3532,_ATTENDANT._,"Whose life was mine, as needful to my day"
3533,_ATTENDANT._,"As is the sun; as natural, old a want"
3534,_ATTENDANT._,To very life as is the bathing air
3535,_ATTENDANT._,That my blood battens on. Take these away
3536,_ATTENDANT._,And give him back; it then were likelier
3537,_ATTENDANT._,"I should not gasp, fret, pale, nor starve, nor pine."
3538,_ATTENDANT._,"He is gone! O miserably, suddenly,"
3539,_ATTENDANT._,"For ever; alas! alas!—See, who comes hither?"
3540,_ATTENDANT._,
3541,_ATTENDANT._,"_Att._ ’Tis Agrippina, lady; and she carries"
3542,_ATTENDANT._,Wreaths such as ours.                                           1880
3543,_ATTENDANT._,
3544,_ATTENDANT._,_Oct._                Let us begone in haste.
3545,_ATTENDANT._,
3546,_ATTENDANT._,"_Att._ Alas! she hath seen us, lady: ’tis too late."
3547,_ATTENDANT._,
3548,_ATTENDANT._,"_Oct._ I’ll but salute her. I pray you all keep back,"
3549,_ATTENDANT._,Nor speak with her attendants.
3550,_ATTENDANT._,
3551,_ATTENDANT._,"_Enter Agrippina, Fulvia, and Attendants._"

3554,_AGRIPPINA._,
3555,_AGRIPPINA._,"My dearest daughter,"
3556,_AGRIPPINA._,I have longed for this embrace. Where else but here
3557,_AGRIPPINA._,Beside this sacred tomb should we have met?
3558,_AGRIPPINA._,"I should have been much with thee in thy sorrow,"
3559,_AGRIPPINA._,But am forbidden the palace.
3560,_AGRIPPINA._,
3561,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._                       I must thank thee
3562,_AGRIPPINA._,Doing this grace to my unhappy brother.
3563,_AGRIPPINA._,The gods grant thee kind messages. Farewell.
3564,_AGRIPPINA._,
3565,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._ Nay, go not thus. See how I hang these garlands."
3566,_AGRIPPINA._,
3567,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Oct._ Not there, nay, not on mine; not there! thy grief      1891"
3568,_AGRIPPINA._,Must own a lower place; mix not its show
3569,_AGRIPPINA._,With mine. He was my brother.
3570,_AGRIPPINA._,
3571,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                        Thou art right.
3572,_AGRIPPINA._,"Set them here, Fulvia. If my heart is wronged,"
3573,_AGRIPPINA._,’Tis done unwittingly; thou canst not know.
3574,_AGRIPPINA._,
3575,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._ I leave thee.
3576,_AGRIPPINA._,
3577,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._               Grant one word.
3578,_AGRIPPINA._,
3579,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._                               Would’st thou be kind
3580,_AGRIPPINA._,’Twill be but one.
3581,_AGRIPPINA._,
3582,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._             ’Tis this then: I am kind.
3583,_AGRIPPINA._,In sum ’twas this I came to say.
3584,_AGRIPPINA._,
3585,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._                           If hither
3586,_AGRIPPINA._,"Thou didst but come to seek me, know I had chosen"
3587,_AGRIPPINA._,The hour to be alone.
3588,_AGRIPPINA._,
3589,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._                My dearest child,                       1900"
3590,_AGRIPPINA._,"My injured child! See, I would have thee trust"
3591,_AGRIPPINA._,"My friendship. ’Twas my constant, loving wish"
3592,_AGRIPPINA._,"To right thy brother’s wrongs, and now my heart"
3593,_AGRIPPINA._,Is wholly turned on thee.
3594,_AGRIPPINA._,
3595,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._                    Think not of me.
3596,_AGRIPPINA._,Am I not past all help? nor do I crave
3597,_AGRIPPINA._,The help that leads to death.
3598,_AGRIPPINA._,
3599,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                        O never dream
3600,_AGRIPPINA._,That I had hand in that accursèd deed.
3601,_AGRIPPINA._,The terror of it rather hath possessed
3602,_AGRIPPINA._,My purpose with the justice of revenge.                         1909
3603,_AGRIPPINA._,
3604,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Oct._ I cannot thank thee, and from thy messengers"
3605,_AGRIPPINA._,Have gathered all. There’s nought to say. Farewell.
3606,_AGRIPPINA._,
3607,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._ Thou dost not know Poppæa marries Cæsar.
3608,_AGRIPPINA._,
3609,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._ Ay.
3610,_AGRIPPINA._,
3611,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._ Thou consentest?
3612,_AGRIPPINA._,
3613,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Oct._                  Say, would my refusal"
3614,_AGRIPPINA._,Or my consent be counted?
3615,_AGRIPPINA._,
3616,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                    It shall not be.
3617,_AGRIPPINA._,
3618,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._ It matters not.
3619,_AGRIPPINA._,
3620,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._                 Thou lookest for divorce?
3621,_AGRIPPINA._,
3622,_AGRIPPINA._,_Oct._ Can I remain his wife who killed my brother?
3623,_AGRIPPINA._,
3624,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Agr._ Thou art the last branch of the house of Claudius,"
3625,_AGRIPPINA._,"And if thou wilt forget the hurt now done thee,"
3626,_AGRIPPINA._,"May’st yet retrieve thy blood; but being too proud,"
3627,_AGRIPPINA._,Wilt more dishonour what thou seemest to honour.
3628,_AGRIPPINA._,"If now thou’rt brave, and wilt join hands with me..."
3629,_AGRIPPINA._,
3630,_AGRIPPINA._,"_Oct._ O never, never! was it not that hand"
3631,_AGRIPPINA._,"That.... O my brother, with thy trait’rous foe"
3632,_AGRIPPINA._,"Make peace, and at thy tomb! Ask clemency"
3633,_AGRIPPINA._,Of him that murdered thee! O never.—
3634,_AGRIPPINA._,"Thou most dear shade, who wast too mild and kind,"
3635,_AGRIPPINA._,If death seal not thy spiritual sense
3636,_AGRIPPINA._,"To my loud sorrow, hear me! O thou my joy,"
3637,_AGRIPPINA._,"By whom the bitterness of life, my lot"
3638,_AGRIPPINA._,"Of horror, was quite sweetened,—cruelly,                        1930"
3639,_AGRIPPINA._,"Most cruelly slain. Ay, I will all forget"
3640,_AGRIPPINA._,When he who wrought this thing can bring again
3641,_AGRIPPINA._,Out of thy cold unmotionable ashes
3642,_AGRIPPINA._,The well-compacted body and grace of life.
3643,_AGRIPPINA._,"Ay, if he make one smile of thine, although"
3644,_AGRIPPINA._,"It last no time, I will forget: but else,"
3645,_AGRIPPINA._,"I say, the thing he hath done, since so ’tis done"
3646,_AGRIPPINA._,"That he cannot undo it, he must o’er-do"
3647,_AGRIPPINA._,Ere I forget.
3648,_AGRIPPINA._,
3649,_AGRIPPINA._,_Agr._        I will be yet thy friend—
3650,_AGRIPPINA._,
3651,_AGRIPPINA._,[_Exit Oct. with Attendants._
3652,_AGRIPPINA._,
3653,_AGRIPPINA._,There comes no help from her. Maybe her grief
3654,_AGRIPPINA._,"Is yet too fresh. Come, Fulvia, let us go.                      1941"
3655,_AGRIPPINA._,She would not speak with me. Now on all hands
3656,_AGRIPPINA._,"Thou seest I am set aside, and count for nought."
3657,_AGRIPPINA._,Yet not for this am I a whit discouraged;
3658,_AGRIPPINA._,I shall rise yet. Am I not Agrippina?      [_Exeunt._

3676,_POPPÆA._,
3677,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._ I’ll have it without bargain or not at all.
3678,_POPPÆA._,
3679,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ I grant it: ask.                                       1950
3680,_POPPÆA._,
3681,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._                  ’Tis that you give my husband
3682,_POPPÆA._,The post in Lusitania which he begs.
3683,_POPPÆA._,
3684,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ ’Tis his. Would he were there.
3685,_POPPÆA._,
3686,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._                                My thanks.

3692,_POPPÆA._,"Of generosity: why, when he goes"
3693,_POPPÆA._,I must go with him.
3694,_POPPÆA._,
3695,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._              Eh! if that’s the case
3696,_POPPÆA._,I grant not his commission.
3697,_POPPÆA._,
3698,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._                      ’Tis a promise.
3699,_POPPÆA._,
3700,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ I had a promise once.
3701,_POPPÆA._,
3702,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._                       That was conditioned.
3703,_POPPÆA._,

3708,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._                          Say, what have I lacked in?"
3709,_POPPÆA._,
3710,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._ Or did I dream ’twas promised me? ’Twas this;          1960
3711,_POPPÆA._,Marriage.
3712,_POPPÆA._,
3713,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._ By Juno, I will marry thee."
3714,_POPPÆA._,But come to Baiæ.
3715,_POPPÆA._,
3716,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._            Nay; thine oath is vain
3717,_POPPÆA._,Upon the point of honour. There are things
3718,_POPPÆA._,"Idle and ceremonial, and that count"
3719,_POPPÆA._,"In love as nought, but which alone can make"
3720,_POPPÆA._,"Divorce from Otho honourable, nay,"

3756,_TIGELLINUS._,More of my scheme anon; but for the present

3774,_ANICETUS._,To nature’s flush; to leave our memories
3775,_ANICETUS._,"With the din and smoke of Rome, and force a pageant"
3776,_ANICETUS._,"Upon the lazy mirror of the bay,—"
3777,_ANICETUS._,"One to make Venus jealous, and confound"

3790,_ANICETUS._,
3791,_ANICETUS._,_Ner._ Patience! I know his mood: he will be tragic;
3792,_ANICETUS._,And you shall see the severe and tearful muse

3830,_PARIS._,
3831,_PARIS._,_Ner._          Stand all aside. Art thou in earnest?
3832,_PARIS._,
3833,_PARIS._,"_Par._ Pardon me, Cæsar. Did this plot concern"
3834,_PARIS._,Less than thy life...
3835,_PARIS._,
3836,_PARIS._,"_Ner._                 My life! by all the gods,"
3837,_PARIS._,Speak but his name who dares.
3838,_PARIS._,
3839,_PARIS._,_Par._                        Will Cæsar’s ear
3840,_PARIS._,Grant me indulgence?
3841,_PARIS._,
3842,_PARIS._,"_Ner._               Speak, fool, or thou diest."
3843,_PARIS._,
3844,_PARIS._,_Par._ The matter is disclosed by certain freedmen
3845,_PARIS._,Engaged by the empress.
3846,_PARIS._,
3847,_PARIS._,_Ner._                  Ah!
3848,_PARIS._,
3849,_PARIS._,_Pop._ (_to Nero_).         Said I not so?
3850,_PARIS._,
3851,_PARIS._,"_Ner._ Be this proved, ’tis the last."
3852,_PARIS._,
3853,_PARIS._,"_Pop._ (_to Nero_).            Ay, till the next."
3854,_PARIS._,
3855,_PARIS._,"_Ner._ Paris, as thou would’st live another moment,"
3856,_PARIS._,Speak now but truth.
3857,_PARIS._,
3858,_PARIS._,_Par._ (_shows a paper_).   See here the evidence.
3859,_PARIS._,"If Cæsar read this, ’twill give certain colour                  2030"
3860,_PARIS._,To worst suspicion. Here are writ the names.
3861,_PARIS._,
3862,_PARIS._,_Ner._ Read me the names.
3863,_PARIS._,
3864,_PARIS._,_Par._                    Rubellius Plautus.
3865,_PARIS._,
3866,_PARIS._,_Ner._                                       Ha!
3867,_PARIS._,Enough. I know ’tis true the villain’s blood
3868,_PARIS._,Hath from Augustus equal claim with mine.
3869,_PARIS._,Who else?
3870,_PARIS._,
3871,_PARIS._,"_Par._    Balbillus and Arruntius Stella,"
3872,_PARIS._,"With Fænius Rufus, and your royal mother,"
3873,_PARIS._,And some who ’scape the crime disclosing it.
3874,_PARIS._,
3875,_PARIS._,_Ner._ I’ll have their lives to-night.
3876,_PARIS._,
3877,_PARIS._,"_Tig._                                 I pray now, Cæsar,"
3878,_PARIS._,Grant me this order.
3879,_PARIS._,
3880,_PARIS._,_Anic._              Or me.
3881,_PARIS._,
3882,_PARIS._,"_Ner._                      Nay, who are ye?"
3883,_PARIS._,"Go, Tigellinus, fetch me Burrus hither.                         2040"
3884,_PARIS._,
3885,_PARIS._,_Par._ I have his name set down with the conspiracy.
3886,_PARIS._,
3887,_PARIS._,_Ner._ Burrus?
3888,_PARIS._,
3889,_PARIS._,"_Par._         ’Tis question of him, nothing certain."
3890,_PARIS._,
3891,_PARIS._,_Ner._ Escort him here unarmed; I’ll speak with him.
3892,_PARIS._,
3893,_PARIS._,"_Tig._ Cæsar, I go.      [_Exit._"
3894,_PARIS._,
3895,_PARIS._,"_Ner._              Give me thy paper, sirrah."
3896,_PARIS._,
3897,_PARIS._,What have we here?      [_Reads._
3898,_PARIS._,
3899,_PARIS._,_Petr._ (_to Servt._) Call me my servant there.
3900,_PARIS._,
3901,_PARIS._,_Anic._ Wilt thou go?
3902,_PARIS._,
3903,_PARIS._,"_Petr._               Ay, ’tis sadly out of place,"
3904,_PARIS._,"This business at this time. Look, Anicetus,"
3905,_PARIS._,Thou’rt new to Cæsar’s suppers; let me tell thee
3906,_PARIS._,There’s ever something wrong. See how he takes it!
3907,_PARIS._,"Mad, mad!                                                       2050"
3908,_PARIS._,
3909,_PARIS._,_Ner._ (_aside_). I see. Plautus. This hits my life:
3910,_PARIS._,"Britannicus being dead, that hope cut off,"
3911,_PARIS._,She looks to Plautus’ claim: and I to be
3912,_PARIS._,Poisoned or what appears not: yet I doubt not
3913,_PARIS._,Poisoned. ’Tis found in time. Now ’tis plain war;
3914,_PARIS._,The strongest wins. Poison! ’Tis life for life.
3915,_PARIS._,"Nay, maybe already I have swallowed down"
3916,_PARIS._,"Some death-steeped morsel; ay, this very night"
3917,_PARIS._,"Have tasted of it, and the subtle drug"
3918,_PARIS._,"Runs in my veins concocting: my spirit sickens,"
3919,_PARIS._,I faint and tremble. What is it?
3920,_PARIS._,
3921,_PARIS._,"_Anic._ (_advancing_).           Cæsar, a word.               2060"
3922,_PARIS._,
3923,_PARIS._,_Ner._ What would’st thou say?
3924,_PARIS._,
3925,_PARIS._,_Anic._ (_to Ner._)            ’Tis I can do this thing.
3926,_PARIS._,None that be here lack will: I have the means.
3927,_PARIS._,"’Twere easy, would you give me the command."
3928,_PARIS._,
3929,_PARIS._,_Ner._ What would be easy?
3930,_PARIS._,
3931,_PARIS._,"_Anic._                    Why, this thing that hangs,"
3932,_PARIS._,"Which you for Rome so wisely, and for you"
3933,_PARIS._,Rome and your friends have wished. If but your foe
3934,_PARIS._,"Step on a ship of mine, I’ll beg my death"
3935,_PARIS._,"If it touch land again. We go to Baiæ,"
3936,_PARIS._,And there upon the hazard of the sea

3938,_PARIS._,
3939,_PARIS._,_Enter Burrus with Tigellinus._
3940,_PARIS._,
3941,_PARIS._,_Ner._ (_to Anic._)      I thank thy zeal;                    2070
3942,_PARIS._,
3943,_PARIS._,"There is no need; give way.—Burrus, thou’rt called"
3944,_PARIS._,Upon a stern occasion. Is’t not death
3945,_PARIS._,To any man or woman whosoe’er
3946,_PARIS._,That plots to murder Cæsar?
3947,_PARIS._,
3948,_BURRUS._,_BURRUS._
3949,_BURRUS._,
3950,_BURRUS._,Death deserved.
3951,_BURRUS._,
3952,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ Here be the names of some who thus offend.
3953,_BURRUS._,Thine is amongst them: of thine honesty
3954,_BURRUS._,I am too well persuaded to demand
3955,_BURRUS._,"More proof than this, that thou do execute"
3956,_BURRUS._,All these conspirators to-night.
3957,_BURRUS._,
3958,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                           —Cæsar
3959,_BURRUS._,Is not mistaken in me. Let me see                               2080

3966,_BURRUS._,
3967,_BURRUS._,"_Anic._ (_to Petr._)                 Nay, nay,"
3968,_BURRUS._,I’ll see it out.      [_Exit Petronius._
3969,_BURRUS._,
3970,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._ (_aside_). What’s this? Why, ’tis mere nonsense.—"
3971,_BURRUS._,What evidence hath Cæsar of this plot?
3972,_BURRUS._,
3973,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ Confession of the traitors. Paris brings it
3974,_BURRUS._,Fresh from Domitia.
3975,_BURRUS._,
3976,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._              Now, with your permission,"
3977,_BURRUS._,I’ll question Paris.
3978,_BURRUS._,
3979,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._               Question! why, is’t not plain?"
3980,_BURRUS._,"Question is treasonous; and thou to question,"
3981,_BURRUS._,Whose name the black suspicion pricks! wilt thou
3982,_BURRUS._,Question?—who hast the deepest cause of all                     2090
3983,_BURRUS._,For sure conviction? Is’t not horrible
3984,_BURRUS._,"That I, to whose security the empire"
3985,_BURRUS._,"Looks for stability, should most of all"
3986,_BURRUS._,"Live an uneasy and precarious life,"
3987,_BURRUS._,"And find no remedy because my ministers,"
3988,_BURRUS._,Who should be over-zealous to protect me
3989,_BURRUS._,"Even from imagined danger, shut their eyes"
3990,_BURRUS._,And ears to plots and perils which I hear
3991,_BURRUS._,My slaves and women prate of?
3992,_BURRUS._,
3993,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._                        Cæsar, the matter"
3994,_BURRUS._,Demands inquiry. That you have been much wronged
3995,_BURRUS._,Is clear: by whom is doubtful. Let me pray                      2101
3996,_BURRUS._,"You save your judgment from reproach of haste,"
3997,_BURRUS._,And hear what I advise.
3998,_BURRUS._,
3999,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                  Speak; I will hear.
4000,_BURRUS._,Speak.
4001,_BURRUS._,
4002,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ First dismiss the company: ’tis ill
4003,_BURRUS._,To have had this audience.
4004,_BURRUS._,
4005,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                     Friends, you are all dismissed."
4006,_BURRUS._,Begone without a word: this business presses.
4007,_BURRUS._,
4008,_BURRUS._,"_Pop._ (_to Nero_). Have some one with you, Nero; are you advised?"
4009,_BURRUS._,Keep a guard while you can.
4010,_BURRUS._,
4011,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._ (_to Pop._)          Nay, have no fear."
4012,_BURRUS._,
4013,_BURRUS._,_Pop._ I would not trust him. Did not Paris say
4014,_BURRUS._,His name was with the rest?
4015,_BURRUS._,
4016,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ (_to Pop._)   Be not afraid.—                          2110
4017,_BURRUS._,"Good night, my lords. (_To Bur._) Shall Paris stay?"
4018,_BURRUS._,
4019,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._                                              No, none."
4020,_BURRUS._,

4027,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ (_to Pop._)                             He’s not my enemy.
4028,_BURRUS._,
4029,_BURRUS._,_Pop._ I fear to leave thee with him.
4030,_BURRUS._,
4031,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                                Have no fear.
4032,_BURRUS._,
4033,_BURRUS._,_Pop._ Could he not kill thee?
4034,_BURRUS._,
4035,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                         Nay, nay."
4036,_BURRUS._,
4037,_BURRUS._,"_Pop._                                   Oh, he will."
4038,_BURRUS._,Alas! alas! Oh! oh!      [_Faints._
4039,_BURRUS._,
4040,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._              Why, thou must go."
4041,_BURRUS._,
4042,_BURRUS._,[_Exit Nero carrying out Poppæa._
4043,_BURRUS._,
4044,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ (_solus_). Be hanged! the fool’s gone too.
4045,_BURRUS._,
4046,_BURRUS._,_Re-enter Nero._
4047,_BURRUS._,
4048,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                          Now, Burrus, now."
4049,_BURRUS._,Art thou my friend?
4050,_BURRUS._,
4051,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._              —We are alone, and while"
4052,_BURRUS._,"There’s none to hear, you must excuse a soldier"
4053,_BURRUS._,"If he speak plainly, Cæsar."
4054,_BURRUS._,
4055,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                      Indeed, Burrus,                   2120"
4056,_BURRUS._,Thou art my only friend; speak as a friend.
4057,_BURRUS._,
4058,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._ I have heard it said the German warriors,"
4059,_BURRUS._,"Meet o’er their cups, and, hot with wine, resolve"
4060,_BURRUS._,Matters of state; but ere they put in act
4061,_BURRUS._,"Their midnight policy, they meet again"
4062,_BURRUS._,In morning hours to see if sober sense
4063,_BURRUS._,Approve what frenzied zeal inspired. The custom
4064,_BURRUS._,Has been applauded. Chance has given to you
4065,_BURRUS._,The one half of the method: use the other.
4066,_BURRUS._,
4067,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ I am not drunk.                                        2130
4068,_BURRUS._,
4069,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._                 Such wandering judgment, Cæsar,"
4070,_BURRUS._,Asks such excuse.
4071,_BURRUS._,
4072,_BURRUS._,_Ner._            My judgment wanders not.
4073,_BURRUS._,I am cool. My face is flushed?...
4074,_BURRUS._,
4075,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                            How will this look
4076,_BURRUS._,"If, sitting here at table, at a breath"
4077,_BURRUS._,Of hearsay you commit to instant death
4078,_BURRUS._,"Your mother and four noble citizens,"
4079,_BURRUS._,With others of less note?
4080,_BURRUS._,
4081,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                    Choose I the time?
4082,_BURRUS._,Shall the conspirators be pardoned then
4083,_BURRUS._,’Cause Cæsar sups? or say Cæsar must fast
4084,_BURRUS._,"And touch no wine, lest when his blood be warm"
4085,_BURRUS._,"Some treasonous practice creep into his ears,                   2140"
4086,_BURRUS._,And they who would befriend conspiracy
4087,_BURRUS._,May point suspicion on his judgment! Now
4088,_BURRUS._,"Is a good hour for treason; Cæsar sups,"
4089,_BURRUS._,And must not credit it.
4090,_BURRUS._,
4091,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                  I do not blame
4092,_BURRUS._,Your feast.
4093,_BURRUS._,
4094,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ No more then: let it be to-night.
4095,_BURRUS._,
4096,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ What! on a charge unproven?
4097,_BURRUS._,
4098,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                             Thou may’st prove it.
4099,_BURRUS._,
4100,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._ See, you acquit me; why not then the rest?"
4101,_BURRUS._,
4102,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._ Acquit my mother! would’st thou persuade me, Burrus,"
4103,_BURRUS._,She can be acquitted?
4104,_BURRUS._,
4105,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                Of the deeds she has done
4106,_BURRUS._,"She is guilty; for this action charged against her,"
4107,_BURRUS._,It is not hers.
4108,_BURRUS._,
4109,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._          Oh, more, much more is hers                   2151"
4110,_BURRUS._,"Than thou dost dream. The crime men charge on me,"
4111,_BURRUS._,"My brother’s death, Burrus, indeed, I swear,"
4112,_BURRUS._,"Though thou believe me not, yet if my part"
4113,_BURRUS._,In that were separate and weighed ’gainst hers ...
4114,_BURRUS._,"I would not tell thee... Oh, I had been happy had I"
4115,_BURRUS._,But heard thee then.
4116,_BURRUS._,
4117,_BURRUS._,_Bur._               Your peace even now as much
4118,_BURRUS._,"Hangs on good counsel. You are hot: be guided, Cæsar."
4119,_BURRUS._,
4120,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._ Nay, now thou’rt changed, thou’rt wrong: thou goest round"
4121,_BURRUS._,To the other side. If thou would’st give the advice
4122,_BURRUS._,"I need, I’d take it gladly. Listen, Burrus:                     2161"
4123,_BURRUS._,I have another secret; if I tell thee
4124,_BURRUS._,Thou may’st befriend me. I will tell thee. Hark!
4125,_BURRUS._,’Tis this: I fear my mother; I cannot sound
4126,_BURRUS._,Her heartlessness; my terror shames the shows
4127,_BURRUS._,And feeble efforts of my trust and love.
4128,_BURRUS._,I have read her eyes—
4129,_BURRUS._,"Oh, there’s no tenderness, no pious scruple"
4130,_BURRUS._,Writ in my favour there; nothing but hate.
4131,_BURRUS._,To think that I am her son but whets to fierceness
4132,_BURRUS._,"Her fury, and her hellish plots are laid                        2171"
4133,_BURRUS._,More recklessly and safely that she deems
4134,_BURRUS._,I am not knit of that obdurate nerve
4135,_BURRUS._,To sear the tender place of natural love.
4136,_BURRUS._,"I would not do it, Burrus, though I fear her"
4137,_BURRUS._,"And hate her, as I must; but let it end"
4138,_BURRUS._,"Ere it be worse. I pray thee do it, Burrus."
4139,_BURRUS._,
4140,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ The cause of fear is magnified by terror:
4141,_BURRUS._,The present circumstance were amply met
4142,_BURRUS._,"By Agrippina’s exile, which I urge,                             2180"
4143,_BURRUS._,"As ever, now. But let such sentence rest"
4144,_BURRUS._,On proven crime.
4145,_BURRUS._,
4146,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._           Oh, thus were ne’er an end."
4147,_BURRUS._,"Done, we stand clear."
4148,_BURRUS._,
4149,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._                Thus done, ’twere a foul crime:"
4150,_BURRUS._,And if you have found remorse in what before
4151,_BURRUS._,"Was schemed in fear and haste, consider, Cæsar,"
4152,_BURRUS._,If you would thank me for subserviency
4153,_BURRUS._,Did I obey; for your sake I refuse.
4154,_BURRUS._,
4155,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ Eh!
4156,_BURRUS._,
4157,_BURRUS._,_Bur._     I refuse.
4158,_BURRUS._,
4159,_BURRUS._,_Ner._               I have other friends.
4160,_BURRUS._,
4161,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                                     So be it.
4162,_BURRUS._,"Take my demission. But remember, Cæsar,"
4163,_BURRUS._,"That he who fills my place, handles the power                   2190"
4164,_BURRUS._,That holds you up; he that hath strength to help
4165,_BURRUS._,May find the will to hurt you.
4166,_BURRUS._,
4167,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                         I meant not that.
4168,_BURRUS._,"I trust thee, Burrus: I’ll be guided by thee."
4169,_BURRUS._,What wilt thou do?
4170,_BURRUS._,
4171,_BURRUS._,_Bur._             The wisest course is thus:
4172,_BURRUS._,To-morrow Seneca and I will go
4173,_BURRUS._,"With chosen witnesses to Agrippina,"
4174,_BURRUS._,"And lay the charge. If she draw quit of it,"
4175,_BURRUS._,"Well; but if not, I promise that her place"
4176,_BURRUS._,Shall not win favour of me.
4177,_BURRUS._,
4178,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                      Dost thou promise?
4179,_BURRUS._,
4180,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ I promise that.
4181,_BURRUS._,
4182,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                 And if there be a doubt,               2200"
4183,_BURRUS._,Thou’lt wrest it to my side?
4184,_BURRUS._,
4185,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                       I promise that.
4186,_BURRUS._,
4187,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ ’Tis death.
4188,_BURRUS._,
4189,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._             Ay, death."
4190,_BURRUS._,
4191,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                        If that be thy last word
4192,_BURRUS._,I am free. I would I had more such friends as thou.
4193,_BURRUS._,But bring it not back; take all my power. Thou saidst
4194,_BURRUS._,I had no cause for fear?
4195,_BURRUS._,
4196,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                   What should you fear?
4197,_BURRUS._,
4198,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ I think thou’rt right.
4199,_BURRUS._,
4200,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._                        Now, Cæsar, I will leave you."
4201,_BURRUS._,Your spirits are much moved.
4202,_BURRUS._,
4203,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                       Indeed I swear
4204,_BURRUS._,I am not moved. There was no need to blame
4205,_BURRUS._,"My supper, Burrus."
4206,_BURRUS._,
4207,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._             Nay, I blamed it not."
4208,_BURRUS._,
4209,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ I am not sensible to wine as others.                   2210
4210,_BURRUS._,"Of all I meet there’s none, no, not the best,"
4211,_BURRUS._,"Can eat and drink as I. There’s something, Burrus,"
4212,_BURRUS._,"In that. I think if I, who rule the world,"
4213,_BURRUS._,"Could not enjoy my wine, that were a blemish"
4214,_BURRUS._,Which scorn might hit.
4215,_BURRUS._,
4216,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                 I never blamed your supper.
4217,_BURRUS._,
4218,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._ Hadst thou been there, thou would’st have praised it well."
4219,_BURRUS._,"I have learned much lately in these things. Petronius,"
4220,_BURRUS._,"Ay, he’s the man—I’m blessed in this Petronius."
4221,_BURRUS._,Thou know’st him?
4222,_BURRUS._,
4223,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._            Ay, and would not keep his hours."
4224,_BURRUS._,"’Tis late, to bed."
4225,_BURRUS._,
4226,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._             Well, Burrus, I’ll to bed.                 2220"
4227,_BURRUS._,But thou must sup with me. I’d gladly have thee
4228,_BURRUS._,One of our party. I shall tell Petronius.
4229,_BURRUS._,
4230,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._ Cæsar, good night."
4231,_BURRUS._,
4232,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                    By heaven, I had forgot;"
4233,_BURRUS._,Where did I leave Poppæa? I remember.
4234,_BURRUS._,"Good night, Burrus, good night.      [_Exit._"
4235,_BURRUS._,
4236,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                          Now may brave Bacchus
4237,_BURRUS._,"Reclaim the field; for me, I’ll gather up"
4238,_BURRUS._,"This quenched brand, and be off. What must men think"
4239,_BURRUS._,"Of Cæsar, who would fetch him with such trash?"
4240,_BURRUS._,The Augusta marry Plautus! Master Paris
4241,_BURRUS._,For this will need his wit to save his skin.      [_Exit._

4252,_AGRIPPINA._,Some art to make time fly? another month
4253,_AGRIPPINA._,Of prison and neglect would kill me quite.

4256,_FULVIA._,
4257,_FULVIA._,Is’t not the change more than the solitude
4258,_FULVIA._,Vexes your majesty?
4259,_FULVIA._,
4260,_FULVIA._,"_Agr._              Nay, I was never made"
4261,_FULVIA._,"For isolation, and even by my friends"

4265,_FULVIA._,"Was very constant, tho’ we have not seen her"
4266,_FULVIA._,Now for four days.
4267,_FULVIA._,
4268,_FULVIA._,_Agr._             Bah! she’s my foe. I wronged her
4269,_FULVIA._,That way a woman ne’er forgives. ’Twas I                        2240
4270,_FULVIA._,"Broke off her match with Sextius, you remember."
4271,_FULVIA._,
4272,_FULVIA._,"_Ful._ Your true friends dare not come: they stand aloof,"
4273,_FULVIA._,"Watching the time to do you service, madam."
4274,_FULVIA._,
4275,_FULVIA._,_Agr._ You speak of Pallas: there’s none else.

4277,_FULVIA._,_Ful._                                         The lot
4278,_FULVIA._,Of late befallen your majesty is such
4279,_FULVIA._,"As all our sex have borne, who have not raised"
4280,_FULVIA._,Nor much demeaned themselves beyond the rest.
4281,_FULVIA._,
4282,_FULVIA._,_Agr._ True; but ’twas never mine; I made escape.
4283,_FULVIA._,"They that would lock us up in idleness,"
4284,_FULVIA._,"Shut us from all affairs, treat us as dolls                     2250"
4285,_FULVIA._,Appointed for their pleasure; these but make it
4286,_FULVIA._,The easier for a woman with a will
4287,_FULVIA._,To have her way. Life lacks machinery
4288,_FULVIA._,"To thwart us. Had I been a man, methinks"
4289,_FULVIA._,"I had done as well, but never with the means"
4290,_FULVIA._,"I have used. Nay, nay, ’tis easy for a woman,"

4297,_FULVIA._,"Fulvia, here’s one apiece: make your own choice;"

4303,_FULVIA._,"Look, Fulvia, now if Mercury have not heard"
4304,_FULVIA._,Our prayers and sent us noble visitors!
4305,_FULVIA._,"Pray you be seated. Alas, in this poor house"
4306,_FULVIA._,I fear I cannot show you the reception
4307,_FULVIA._,You and your gallant followers deserve.
4308,_FULVIA._,"’Tis not what thou’rt accustomed to at home,"
4309,_FULVIA._,"Seneca, I know: pardon it. Thou lookest cold."
4310,_FULVIA._,Come near the fire: pray heaven this bitter weather
4311,_FULVIA._,May not have touched thy chest. A Gallic winter!
4312,_FULVIA._,I can remember no such fall of snow                             2271
4313,_FULVIA._,"In March these twenty years; but looking back,"
4314,_FULVIA._,I find one noted in my journal then.

4322,_SENECA._,It cheers me much.

4324,_BURRUS._,_BURRUS._
4325,_BURRUS._,
4326,_BURRUS._,"The truth is, madam, we come"
4327,_BURRUS._,At Nero’s order.
4328,_BURRUS._,
4329,_BURRUS._,_Agr._           Ha! then I strike you off      [_Rising._
4330,_BURRUS._,My list of friends again. I thought as much;
4331,_BURRUS._,I wondered how you dared me this affront
4332,_BURRUS._,"In my last poor retreat, here where I sit                       2280"
4333,_BURRUS._,"Alone and friendless, in the worst disgrace"
4334,_BURRUS._,"Woman can suffer;—ay, and caused by you."
4335,_BURRUS._,"But learn that, if nought else, this house is mine;"
4336,_BURRUS._,"If ’tis so small that it can welcome little,"
4337,_BURRUS._,It can exclude the more. At Cæsar’s order
4338,_BURRUS._,"Ye have forgot your manners, now at mine"
4339,_BURRUS._,"Resume them. Ye have done his hest, begone!"
4340,_BURRUS._,Begone!
4341,_BURRUS._,
4342,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._  I pray you, madam, hear the message;"
4343,_BURRUS._,We may not leave without delivering it.
4344,_BURRUS._,Burrus will speak it.
4345,_BURRUS._,
4346,_BURRUS._,_Agr._                Oh—Burrus speak it.                     2290
4347,_BURRUS._,"If Burrus speak, the affair is mighty black."
4348,_BURRUS._,There’s none like him to break an ugly business.
4349,_BURRUS._,
4350,_BURRUS._,[_Sitting._
4351,_BURRUS._,
4352,_BURRUS._,"Hey! Well, we have nought to do, so let us hear"
4353,_BURRUS._,The last of the court. Octavia’s divorce?
4354,_BURRUS._,
4355,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._ Believe me, lady, I feel much aggrieved"
4356,_BURRUS._,In all that hurts you here.
4357,_BURRUS._,
4358,_BURRUS._,_Agr._                 Stranger than fiction.
4359,_BURRUS._,Now what’s the matter?
4360,_BURRUS._,
4361,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                 There has been information
4362,_BURRUS._,"To Cæsar of plots against his life, the which"
4363,_BURRUS._,"The informers charge on you. This the chief item,"
4364,_BURRUS._,That you have entered with Rubellius Plautus                    2300
4365,_BURRUS._,Into conspiracy to set him up
4366,_BURRUS._,"In Nero’s place, and to dethrone your son."
4367,_BURRUS._,I come with Seneca and these witnesses
4368,_BURRUS._,"To hear the answer, which your majesty"
4369,_BURRUS._,"No doubt hath very ready, and accordingly"
4370,_BURRUS._,To acquit you of the charge.
4371,_BURRUS._,
4372,_BURRUS._,_Agr._                       —Excellent!
4373,_BURRUS._,"Now, Seneca, ’s thy turn; or will these gentlemen?"
4374,_BURRUS._,"Fulvia, we have depositions to be made:"
4375,_BURRUS._,Fetch pens and paper; all shall be in order.
4376,_BURRUS._,
4377,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._ Madam, remember on what past occasions"
4378,_BURRUS._,"Cæsar hath shown suspicion, and believe,                        2311"
4379,_BURRUS._,"Whate’er your innocency, there is cause"
4380,_BURRUS._,To make it clear.
4381,_BURRUS._,
4382,_BURRUS._,"_Agr._            Thy prudence, Seneca,"
4383,_BURRUS._,"Is vanity, not kindness; spare it, pray."
4384,_BURRUS._,"Here is your paper, gentlemen: I’ll give you"
4385,_BURRUS._,Matter for Cæsar’s reading. Tell me first
4386,_BURRUS._,Who’s my accuser?
4387,_BURRUS._,
4388,_BURRUS._,_Bur._            There are two—the first
4389,_BURRUS._,"Junia Silana, the other is your sister"
4390,_BURRUS._,Domitia: they bring forth as evidence
4391,_BURRUS._,"The informers, certain freedmen, Atimetus,                      2320"
4392,_BURRUS._,"Iturius, and Calvisius, who affirm"
4393,_BURRUS._,"That you have lately been on terms with Plautus,"
4394,_BURRUS._,Stirring him up to make an enterprise
4395,_BURRUS._,"Against the state; that you, by marrying him"
4396,_BURRUS._,(Who by the mother’s side may claim a line
4397,_BURRUS._,"As rightly from Augustus as doth Nero),"
4398,_BURRUS._,"Might reinstate yourself, dethrone your son,"
4399,_BURRUS._,And bring disaster to the commonwealth.
4400,_BURRUS._,"That is the charge, of which we are come to hear"
4401,_BURRUS._,"The refutation, not to press the count.                         2330"
4402,_BURRUS._,
4403,_BURRUS._,"_Agr._ Pah! You’re a brace of idiots, if ye think"
4404,_BURRUS._,"This needs refuting. Who’s Silana, pray,"
4405,_BURRUS._,"That if she speak, the very bonds of nature"
4406,_BURRUS._,"And heaven must be repealed to give her credit,"
4407,_BURRUS._,Saying a mother plots to kill her son?
4408,_BURRUS._,"I marvel not that she, being childless, dares"
4409,_BURRUS._,"Avouch such madness, never having known"
4410,_BURRUS._,"How near the affections of all mothers are,"
4411,_BURRUS._,Nor that a mother cannot shift her love
4412,_BURRUS._,"Like an adulteress;—nay, nor do I wonder                        2340"
4413,_BURRUS._,"That she should find among her freedmen those,"
4414,_BURRUS._,"Who, having in luxury spent all their substance,"
4415,_BURRUS._,Will for the promise of the old lady’s purse
4416,_BURRUS._,Sustain the accusation: but that for this
4417,_BURRUS._,I should be seriously held suspect
4418,_BURRUS._,"Of the infamy of parricide, or Cæsar"
4419,_BURRUS._,"Of giving ear to it, this I marvel at."
4420,_BURRUS._,"As for Domitia, I would thank my sister"
4421,_BURRUS._,"Even for her jealousy, were but the strife                      2349"
4422,_BURRUS._,One of good will and kindness towards my Nero.
4423,_BURRUS._,"But now she wastes her time with her man Paris,"
4424,_BURRUS._,Composing as ’twere fables for the stage.
4425,_BURRUS._,Let her go back to Baiæ and her fishpools;
4426,_BURRUS._,"They kept her trifling spirit well employed,"
4427,_BURRUS._,"When by my efforts Nero’s first adoption,"
4428,_BURRUS._,"Proconsular authority, consulate,"
4429,_BURRUS._,And other steps to empire were procured.
4430,_BURRUS._,Are ye now answered?—
4431,_BURRUS._,Or is there any can be brought to show
4432,_BURRUS._,"That I have practised with the city cohorts,                    2360"
4433,_BURRUS._,"Corrupted the loyalty of the provinces,"
4434,_BURRUS._,Solicited the freedmen to rebellion?
4435,_BURRUS._,Or to what purpose think ye? Had Britannicus
4436,_BURRUS._,"Been Cæsar, then I grant I might have lived;"
4437,_BURRUS._,"But if ’tis Plautus, or whoever else"
4438,_BURRUS._,"Should get the power, how should I lack accusers"
4439,_BURRUS._,"To charge me, not with words escaped in passion,"
4440,_BURRUS._,"But deeds and crimes—crimes—ay, Seneca, crimes,"
4441,_BURRUS._,Of which I could not hope to be acquitted
4442,_BURRUS._,Save as a mother by her son? And ye                             2370
4443,_BURRUS._,Think I shall here defend myself to you!
4444,_BURRUS._,Send Cæsar to me. By the gods I swear
4445,_BURRUS._,I’ll be revenged on all who have had a hand
4446,_BURRUS._,In this most cowardly and senseless plot.
4447,_BURRUS._,I wait him here: tell him that to none other
4448,_BURRUS._,Will I resolve this matter.
4449,_BURRUS._,
4450,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                      Be content
4451,_BURRUS._,"To say so much in form, that our report"
4452,_BURRUS._,Suffice for your acquittal.
4453,_BURRUS._,
4454,_BURRUS._,_Agr._                      I bid you go.
4455,_BURRUS._,
4456,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ Cæsar shall hear your message.
4457,_BURRUS._,
4458,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._                                Madam, we go."
4459,_BURRUS._,
4460,_BURRUS._,"_Agr._ Ay, go, good fellows; though ye have roused my passion, 2380"
4461,_BURRUS._,Your coming here hath cheered me wondrously.
4462,_BURRUS._,"Nay, if ye have ever such another matter,"
4463,_BURRUS._,"Bring it again; be not abashed, but come;"
4464,_BURRUS._,"Or send your wives, and those two gentlemen,"
4465,_BURRUS._,"Whose names I know not. My lords, your humble servant."
4466,_BURRUS._,
4467,_BURRUS._,[_Exeunt Burrus and Seneca and two Gentlemen._
4468,_BURRUS._,
4469,_BURRUS._,Plautus! now is it possible I was wrong
4470,_BURRUS._,"Not to have thought of Plautus? No, I laugh,"
4471,_BURRUS._,’Tis merely laughable. At forty-five
4472,_BURRUS._,To marry a pretender; and Plautus too!
4473,_BURRUS._,"He would not have me. Fulvia, do you think                      2390"
4474,_BURRUS._,That Plautus wants to marry me? Ha! ha!
4475,_BURRUS._,"Is it my beauty, think you, or my virtue,"
4476,_BURRUS._,"Or my good fortune tempts the stoic? Oh,"
4477,_BURRUS._,"Domitia, oh, you are dull. I cannot fear"
4478,_BURRUS._,This plot. We shall retire with more than honour.
4479,_BURRUS._,"’Twas strange, I think, that Pallas was not struck;"
4480,_BURRUS._,His name escaped.
4481,_BURRUS._,
4482,_BURRUS._,"_Ful._            There is ample reason, madam."
4483,_BURRUS._,They say that in his house he holds such caution
4484,_BURRUS._,As not to speak before his slaves. His orders
4485,_BURRUS._,"Are given by nod and sign, or if there’s need                   2400"
4486,_BURRUS._,He writes: there’s none can say they have heard him speak.
4487,_BURRUS._,
4488,_BURRUS._,_Agr._ May good come of it. ’Twould be hard indeed
4489,_BURRUS._,If they should exile Plautus for a fear
4490,_BURRUS._,Lest I should marry him. That were a fate
4491,_BURRUS._,"Of irony. Why, give the man his choice"
4492,_BURRUS._,"Of marrying me and exile, would he not"
4493,_BURRUS._,Fly to the pole? Poor Plautus! marry Plautus!
4494,_BURRUS._,
4495,_BURRUS._,_Both._ Ha! ha! ha! he! he!
4496,_BURRUS._,
4497,_BURRUS._,_Enter Nero. Agrippina is seated._
4498,_BURRUS._,
4499,_NERO._,_NERO._
4500,_NERO._,
4501,_NERO._,"I find you merry, mother; the gods be praised"
4502,_NERO._,That you deny the impeachment.
4503,_NERO._,
4504,_NERO._,"_Agr._                         Really, Nero,"
4505,_NERO._,Burrus’ memory is getting very short
4506,_NERO._,If he said I denied it. I did not.
4507,_NERO._,
4508,_NERO._,_Ner._ You did not?
4509,_NERO._,
4510,_NERO._,"_Agr._              Nay, I’d not be at the pains."
4511,_NERO._,
4512,_NERO._,_Ner._ Called you me hither?
4513,_NERO._,
4514,_NERO._,"_Agr._                       Ay, you seem misled."
4515,_NERO._,I guess who ’tis. But let that pass. I hoped
4516,_NERO._,I might advise you privately; I knew
4517,_NERO._,"You would not wish it known. Now, was I wrong?"
4518,_NERO._,
4519,_NERO._,_Ner._ Do you deny what is affirmed against you?
4520,_NERO._,
4521,_NERO._,"_Agr._ No, son: for if you wished to take my life,"
4522,_NERO._,Why should I rob you of this grand pretence?                    2420
4523,_NERO._,"Yet since you cannot, and the charge itself"
4524,_NERO._,"But moves my laughter, as you overheard,"
4525,_NERO._,My only wish is you should now retire
4526,_NERO._,"With dignity, and act as Cæsar ought."
4527,_NERO._,
4528,_NERO._,_Ner._ (_aside_). This then is added to my shames.
4529,_NERO._,
4530,_NERO._,_Agr._                                            What say you?
4531,_NERO._,"Fulvia, await without. [_Exit Fulvia._] Who brought this to thee?"

4536,_NERO._,
4537,_NERO._,_Ner._                          Last night at supper.
4538,_NERO._,
4539,_NERO._,"_Agr._ Tell me, didst thou believe it? is it possible?"
4540,_NERO._,Thou didst! Whence gottest thou thy wits I wonder;
4541,_NERO._,"Certain they are not mine, no, nor thy father’s:"
4542,_NERO._,I think they came of Claudius by adoption.                      2431
4543,_NERO._,Dost thou believe it still?
4544,_NERO._,
4545,_NERO._,_Ner._                      Whate’er I have done
4546,_NERO._,Was on advice.
4547,_NERO._,
4548,_NERO._,_Agr._         A pious caution truly.
4549,_NERO._,"Is this thy trust? Yet, yet I must forgive thee."
4550,_NERO._,"See, I was angered. Nay, ’twas not thy judgment:"
4551,_NERO._,I know who leads. But for these foolish women
4552,_NERO._,I sentence exile.
4553,_NERO._,
4554,_NERO._,_Ner._            Sentence whom to exile?
4555,_NERO._,
4556,_NERO._,_Agr._ The two devisers. Yet I think my sister
4557,_NERO._,"Is harmless; but the other, that Silana—"
4558,_NERO._,
4559,_NERO._,_Ner._ Silana must be banished?                               2440

4561,_NERO._,"_Agr._                          Judge her, Nero,"
4562,_NERO._,When thou hast heard. She and thy aunt Domitia
4563,_NERO._,"Have been the two who, in my sad retirement,"
4564,_NERO._,Have visited me most. Day after day
4565,_NERO._,"They have made a show of kindness, finding joy"
4566,_NERO._,"In my disgrace, to view it; and have but left me"
4567,_NERO._,To try this trick.
4568,_NERO._,
4569,_NERO._,_Ner._ (_aside_).  ’Tis plain I have been fooled.
4570,_NERO._,
4571,_NERO._,"_Agr._ For those that brought the tale, thou knowest that they"
4572,_NERO._,Must taste the penalties they sought to inflict;
4573,_NERO._,That thou must know; but ’tis not all. The acquittal
4574,_NERO._,Of those accused will not be full without                       2450
4575,_NERO._,Some honour shown them. Best among the names
4576,_NERO._,"Stand Fænius Rufus and Arruntius Stella,"
4577,_NERO._,"Who may have city posts: gentle Balbillus,"
4578,_NERO._,"Who has long deserved it, must be paid at last"
4579,_NERO._,"With a proconsulate. For myself, thou knowest"
4580,_NERO._,I have taken all disgrace so patiently
4581,_NERO._,"That I expect some boon, though yet I fear"
4582,_NERO._,To ask; but when I have seen my slandered friends
4583,_NERO._,"Honoured, I’ll write it thee."
4584,_NERO._,
4585,_NERO._,_Ner._                        I shall be quick
4586,_NERO._,To punish and to make amends. ’Tis just                         2460
4587,_NERO._,"Towards Burrus, I should tell you from the first"
4588,_NERO._,He took your part.
4589,_NERO._,
4590,_NERO._,"_Agr._             What could he else? Now, Nero,"
4591,_NERO._,"I have done: go home, and there resolve the matter"
4592,_NERO._,With common sense; take Burrus into counsel
4593,_NERO._,As to what penalties and what promotions
4594,_NERO._,Shall be distributed. Before the people
4595,_NERO._,"Remember that some feeling must be shown,"
4596,_NERO._,And anger for effronteries attempted
4597,_NERO._,"Against your majesty. Now go, the affair"
4598,_NERO._,"Has somewhat tired me.—Nay, touch me not; farewell.             2470"
4599,_NERO._,
4600,_NERO._,_Ner._ I see you are right; farewell.
4601,_NERO._,
4602,_NERO._,"_Agr._                                I have more advice,"
4603,_NERO._,Which I will write to thee.      [_Exit Nero._
4604,_NERO._,Excellent this—I have not had my way
4605,_NERO._,"Thus for a long long while: ay, now is my time"
4606,_NERO._,To strike. I’ll venture with a letter to him
4607,_NERO._,"And claim my boon, that he dismiss Poppæa."
4608,_NERO._,There’s much to say on that which may seem aimed
4609,_NERO._,More at his good than mine; and if she have plunged
4610,_NERO._,"In this false step, his vanity being touched                    2479"
4611,_NERO._,May shake his liking. I will do it at once.      [_Exit._

4712,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._                     Nay, heaven forbid;"
4713,_POPPÆA._,I trust her not.

4721,_POPPÆA._,"To kill one’s husband, plot against one’s son,"
4722,_POPPÆA._,Should leave unsatisfied some tender feelings

4724,_POPPÆA._,"Those arts which manage you would not gull me,"
4725,_POPPÆA._,A woman not her child. Her whole design
4726,_POPPÆA._,Is bent to thwart our marriage; and she will.
4727,_POPPÆA._,I know it.

4729,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._     I swear that were this proved against her,"

4759,_MESSENGER._,When last we met thou wilt remember to have confessed
4760,_MESSENGER._,"some shame for wrong done to me. The wrong I forgive,"

4836,_SERVANT._,"I must be cool, lest I be foiled once more."
4837,_SERVANT._,Where lies my hindrance? not in her; she has twice
4838,_SERVANT._,Deceived me and escaped: now in my turn
4839,_SERVANT._,"I steal her weapon, and can use it better,"
4840,_SERVANT._,Having been plain before. Then Seneca...
4841,_SERVANT._,"He shall not know, so are his scruples quiet."
4842,_SERVANT._,"For mine, they are hushed already; but ’twere best"

4847,_SERVANT._,"Then there’s the ground of justice; Claudius’ death,"
4848,_SERVANT._,O’er which the executive too long hath slept
4849,_SERVANT._,In Cæsar’s piety: the sentence now
4850,_SERVANT._,"O’ertakes the murderess with a double score,"
4851,_SERVANT._,Since she by her conspiracy contrived
4852,_SERVANT._,"Britannicus should die ... ay, for his death                    2600"
4853,_SERVANT._,The heavy penalty hangs o’er some head;
4854,_SERVANT._,"Now let it fall on hers,—so I am quit."
4855,_SERVANT._,"All this condemns her, long-expected justice"
4856,_SERVANT._,"Cries, and occasion hurries on the hand."
4857,_SERVANT._,"Ay, ay, I am clear. Poppæa being my stake,"
4858,_SERVANT._,I cannot shrink nor swerve. What was’t she wrote?
4859,_SERVANT._,Why here is more.      [_Reads._

4875,_ANICETUS._,_Ner._ But were there one to whom it might be said
4876,_ANICETUS._,Cæsar owed life and fortune—dost thou take me?
4877,_ANICETUS._,
4878,_ANICETUS._,_Anic._ Cæsar would say the Augusta.
4879,_ANICETUS._,
4880,_ANICETUS._,"_Ner._                             Nay, thou’rt dull:"
4881,_ANICETUS._,’Twas thee I meant.
4882,_ANICETUS._,
4883,_ANICETUS._,"_Anic._           Me, Cæsar!"
4884,_ANICETUS._,
4885,_ANICETUS._,_Ner._                     Dost remember
4886,_ANICETUS._,Boasting to me that thou hadst sailor means
4887,_ANICETUS._,To do a certain thing?
4888,_ANICETUS._,
4889,_ANICETUS._,_Anic._              Ay.
4890,_ANICETUS._,
4891,_ANICETUS._,_Ner._                  Do it now.
4892,_ANICETUS._,I’ll owe thee life and fortune. Canst thou be trusted?
4893,_ANICETUS._,
4894,_ANICETUS._,_Anic._ My love for Cæsar follows hand in hand
4895,_ANICETUS._,With his command in this.
4896,_ANICETUS._,
4897,_ANICETUS._,"_Ner._                  Then do it, I say;                    2620"
4898,_ANICETUS._,"No words, no explanation. Agrippina"
4899,_ANICETUS._,Will come to Baiæ: there have thou thy ship.
4900,_ANICETUS._,
4901,_ANICETUS._,"_Anic._ I will have one at Bauli, one at Baiæ:"
4902,_ANICETUS._,If she take either it shall serve the turn.
4903,_ANICETUS._,
4904,_ANICETUS._,_Ner._ Go now contrive thy means; let nothing ’scape thee
4905,_ANICETUS._,To me or any other: when ’tis done
4906,_ANICETUS._,Hold thy head high.
4907,_ANICETUS._,
4908,_ANICETUS._,"_Anic._           Cæsar, I go to do it.      [_Exit._"
4909,_ANICETUS._,
4910,_ANICETUS._,"_Ner._ Now comes my part: ay, though it vex my soul"
4911,_ANICETUS._,"To stoop; tho’ this be Cæsar’s greatest wrong,"
4912,_ANICETUS._,"That he must patch his faultless power with guile,"
4913,_ANICETUS._,"And having all command, miss of his will                        2631"
4914,_ANICETUS._,But for a subterfuge .... yet for this once
4915,_ANICETUS._,"I’ll do it—’tis little; but to write a letter,"
4916,_ANICETUS._,"Feign to discard Poppæa, as mistrusting"
4917,_ANICETUS._,Her love and character; and from that vantage
4918,_ANICETUS._,I surely win my mother to come forth
4919,_ANICETUS._,And join the court at Baiæ—she will come.

4935,_AGRIPPINA._,"Is not this charming, Fulvia? what a day!"
4936,_AGRIPPINA._,I feel I have never breathed spring air before.
4937,_AGRIPPINA._,And how the people cheered! it did me good.                     2640
4938,_AGRIPPINA._,Here’s my old seat. The villa’s looking well.
4939,_AGRIPPINA._,Could but Domitia see us now! How smoothly
4940,_AGRIPPINA._,"Her little plot went off! My first suspicions,"
4941,_AGRIPPINA._,"Fulvia, I am sure were wrong: this invitation"
4942,_AGRIPPINA._,Was most well meant; and see the tenderness
4943,_AGRIPPINA._,Has even called up my tears. You cannot know
4944,_AGRIPPINA._,What fond associations make this house
4945,_AGRIPPINA._,A home indeed. I wish I had not refused
4946,_AGRIPPINA._,"To take the yacht at Bauli: ’twas an error,"
4947,_AGRIPPINA._,Over-precaution.

4952,_FULVIA._,The very words Seleucus....   [_A noise without._
4953,_FULVIA._,
4954,_FULVIA._,_Agr._                    What is that noise?
4955,_FULVIA._,
4956,_FULVIA._,_Ful._ ’Tis Cæsar coming with a company.
4957,_FULVIA._,
4958,_FULVIA._,"_Agr._ Oh, I will see. (_Looking forth._) And there is"
4959,_FULVIA._,Seneca
4960,_FULVIA._,And Burrus. There’s much meaning in this visit.
4961,_FULVIA._,How grand he looks with all his lords about him!
4962,_FULVIA._,There never was a Cæsar like him: others
4963,_FULVIA._,"Have been but Cæsars; he’s an emperor,"
4964,_FULVIA._,And wears the full magnificence of state
4965,_FULVIA._,"In beardless boyhood.—Fulvia, I do love splendour."
4966,_FULVIA._,To be so young and rule the world!                              2660
4967,_FULVIA._,
4968,_FULVIA._,"_Enter Nero, Seneca, and Burrus._"

4977,_NERO._,The season’s compliments.
4978,_NERO._,
4979,_NERO._,_Agr._                  A prompt return.
4980,_NERO._,"What pleasure ’tis, Nero, I cannot say."
4981,_NERO._,"Welcome, my lords."

4984,_SENECA._,
4985,_SENECA._,"My loving service, lady."
4986,_SENECA._,
4987,_SENECA._,_Ner._ Crossed you the bay from Bauli?
4988,_SENECA._,
4989,_SENECA._,"_Agr._                               Nay, you’ll laugh;"
4990,_SENECA._,’Twas foolish; but I wished the folk to see
4991,_SENECA._,"My joy and reconcilement, and in the thought"
4992,_SENECA._,To please so many friends I kept my litter.
4993,_SENECA._,
4994,_SENECA._,_Ner._ You’ll all sup with us?                                2670
4995,_SENECA._,
4996,_SENECA._,_Agr._                       I look for nothing better.
4997,_SENECA._,
4998,_SENECA._,_Ner._ Whom will you bring?
4999,_SENECA._,
5000,_SENECA._,_Agr._                     I have no one with me here
5001,_SENECA._,But Polla Acerronia.
5002,_SENECA._,
5003,_SENECA._,_Ner._             And where is she?
5004,_SENECA._,
5005,_SENECA._,"_Agr._ She took the yacht, and so arrived before us,"
5006,_SENECA._,"But has not left it: like the child she is,"
5007,_SENECA._,The new toy quite distracts her: she is there.
5008,_SENECA._,
5009,_SENECA._,_Ner._ Row you this afternoon upon the bay?
5010,_SENECA._,
5011,_SENECA._,"_Agr._ I had thought of it; and now, if you would come"
5012,_SENECA._,That were a double pleasure.
5013,_SENECA._,
5014,_SENECA._,"_Ner._                     I am sorry, I must go"
5015,_SENECA._,Order to-morrow’s games.
5016,_SENECA._,
5017,_SENECA._,_Agr._                 Your lords mayhap
5018,_SENECA._,Will join me. I can take them to your villa.                    2680
5019,_SENECA._,
5020,_SENECA._,_Sen._ I’ll gladly come: the dust the crowd treads up
5021,_SENECA._,Has filled my throat and set me coughing shrewdly.
5022,_SENECA._,
5023,_SENECA._,"_Ner._ Nay, I shall want you both."
5024,_SENECA._,
5025,_SENECA._,_Agr._                           Some other time
5026,_SENECA._,"I hope, my lords."
5027,_SENECA._,
5028,_BURRUS._,_BURRUS._
5029,_BURRUS._,
5030,_BURRUS._,I thank your majesty.
5031,_BURRUS._,
5032,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ Farewell till supper.
5033,_BURRUS._,
5034,_BURRUS._,_Agr._                     Why! so short a visit!
5035,_BURRUS._,
5036,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ We shall meet soon.
5037,_BURRUS._,
5038,_BURRUS._,"_Agr._                   Well, I will sail alone"
5039,_BURRUS._,"With Polla; ’tis her wish. Escort me, Nero?"
5040,_BURRUS._,
5041,_BURRUS._,_Ner._ Ay.
5042,_BURRUS._,
5043,_BURRUS._,_Agr._   For the sake of that I’ll go at once.
5044,_BURRUS._,I love the sea.
5045,_BURRUS._,
5046,_BURRUS._,"[_Exeunt Nero with Agr. and Fulv. down the quay,"
5047,_BURRUS._,where they are still seen._
5048,_BURRUS._,
5049,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._       Burrus, what say you now!"
5050,_BURRUS._,Has not the thing I looked for come to pass?                    2690
5051,_BURRUS._,
5052,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ There’s as you say a most astounding change;
5053,_BURRUS._,Can you explain it?
5054,_BURRUS._,
5055,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._            Well, you see it, Burrus."
5056,_BURRUS._,
5057,_BURRUS._,_Bur._ How came it all about?
5058,_BURRUS._,
5059,_BURRUS._,_Sen._                      See now how tenderly
5060,_BURRUS._,They both embrace.
5061,_BURRUS._,
5062,_BURRUS._,_Bur._           Who would have thought it?
5063,_BURRUS._,
5064,_BURRUS._,_Sen._                                        I;
5065,_BURRUS._,I should have thought it: and I point to this
5066,_BURRUS._,To justify my words those many times
5067,_BURRUS._,Our speech has come to difference.
5068,_BURRUS._,
5069,_BURRUS._,_Re-enter Nero. Fulvia goes into house._
5070,_BURRUS._,
5071,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                         Now, lords,"
5072,_BURRUS._,I go.
5073,_BURRUS._,
5074,_BURRUS._,"_Bur. and Sen._ We follow, Cæsar."
5075,_BURRUS._,
5076,_BURRUS._,_Ner._                   I have changed my mind;
5077,_BURRUS._,I want you not.      [_Going._
5078,_BURRUS._,
5079,_BURRUS._,_Bur._        Will Cæsar name the hour
5080,_BURRUS._,When we shall wait on him?                                      2700
5081,_BURRUS._,
5082,_BURRUS._,"_Ner._                   Why, come at once."
5083,_BURRUS._,I cannot tell what hour I may not want you.
5084,_BURRUS._,Attend me at my villa.      [_Exit._
5085,_BURRUS._,
5086,_BURRUS._,_Bur._               Of a sudden
5087,_BURRUS._,He is changed again.
5088,_BURRUS._,
5089,_BURRUS._,_Sen._             You see how easily
5090,_BURRUS._,He is overcome with kindness. Would you know
5091,_BURRUS._,The noble sacrifice he has made?
5092,_BURRUS._,
5093,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                         What’s that?
5094,_BURRUS._,
5095,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._ Why, he has renounced Poppæa."
5096,_BURRUS._,
5097,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                             Nay!
5098,_BURRUS._,
5099,_BURRUS._,_Sen._                                Ay.
5100,_BURRUS._,
5101,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                                  Who told you?
5102,_BURRUS._,
5103,_BURRUS._,_Sen._ I saw the letter.
5104,_BURRUS._,
5105,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                 How! Poppæa shows it?
5106,_BURRUS._,
5107,_BURRUS._,_Sen._ ’Twas writ his mother.
5108,_BURRUS._,
5109,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                      Then he has deceived her.
5110,_BURRUS._,
5111,_BURRUS._,_Sen._ Can you think that?
5112,_BURRUS._,
5113,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                   The letter makes all plain.
5114,_BURRUS._,Why did he write it?
5115,_BURRUS._,
5116,_BURRUS._,_Sen._             Why?
5117,_BURRUS._,
5118,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._                Well, well."
5119,_BURRUS._,
5120,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._                          Oh, Burrus,                   2710"
5121,_BURRUS._,I have every cause for hope; and here to-day
5122,_BURRUS._,The meeting in this house more than assures me
5123,_BURRUS._,He must redeem the promise of his youth.
5124,_BURRUS._,"’Twas in this very room, ten years ago,"
5125,_BURRUS._,"I first saw Nero—Ay, ’tis now ten years—"
5126,_BURRUS._,"I was arrived from Corsica at Rome,"
5127,_BURRUS._,And there found summons to attend the Augusta
5128,_BURRUS._,At Baiæ: hither in all haste I came.
5129,_BURRUS._,The yearnings and the miseries of exile
5130,_BURRUS._,"Would make a mean deliverer seem a god,                         2720"
5131,_BURRUS._,And my return drave me half mad with joy.
5132,_BURRUS._,"I entered: in that chair sat Agrippina,"
5133,_BURRUS._,"My kind deliverer, my friend, the empress."
5134,_BURRUS._,"Time had not marred her beauty, and as she spake"
5135,_BURRUS._,Impatience flushed her cheek—she shared my joy.
5136,_BURRUS._,"I knelt in tears there, nor ashamed of tears,"
5137,_BURRUS._,Though at her side I was aware was standing
5138,_BURRUS._,"A boy of some twelve years; whom, when I rose,"
5139,_BURRUS._,"She then presented as her son, and bade me"
5140,_BURRUS._,Take him for pupil. As I saw him then                           2730
5141,_BURRUS._,"In fullest grace of boyhood, apt in all"
5142,_BURRUS._,"Boys should be manly in, and gifted further"
5143,_BURRUS._,"Than boys are wont with insight, and the touch"
5144,_BURRUS._,"Of human sympathy and learned taste,"
5145,_BURRUS._,"Proficient in some arts and dull in none,"
5146,_BURRUS._,"But coy withal and generous, ’twas no wonder"
5147,_BURRUS._,If ere that evening passed I had admitted
5148,_BURRUS._,"The schemes his mother had laid, which in short time"
5149,_BURRUS._,Were brought to pass.
5150,_BURRUS._,
5151,_BURRUS._,_Bur._              ’Twas a black day.
5152,_BURRUS._,
5153,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._                               And yet,"
5154,_BURRUS._,"Burrus, if after you had seen how kindly                        2740"
5155,_BURRUS._,"He took instruction, how he came to love me,"
5156,_BURRUS._,"You would not wonder—nay, I can remember"
5157,_BURRUS._,"Claudius himself was shamed if his Britannicus,"
5158,_BURRUS._,"Being younger but by some two years, were by"
5159,_BURRUS._,Where Nero was: and had I been the father
5160,_BURRUS._,"I might have wished, I think, to have done as he,"
5161,_BURRUS._,And called the best my son.
5162,_BURRUS._,
5163,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                     He killed Britannicus.
5164,_BURRUS._,
5165,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._ Burrus, if as it seems you quite distrust him,"
5166,_BURRUS._,Why hold you still the office which establishes
5167,_BURRUS._,His power?
5168,_BURRUS._,
5169,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._   Because it is an office, Seneca,                     2750"
5170,_BURRUS._,"The top of my profession: yet, by the gods,"
5171,_BURRUS._,"Find you a better man, and I’ll be gone."
5172,_BURRUS._,"But, as a soldier, I’ll not see the guards"
5173,_BURRUS._,Commanded by some brute like Tigellinus.
5174,_BURRUS._,
5175,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._ Nay, be not angry."
5176,_BURRUS._,
5177,_BURRUS._,_Bur._                  Would not you be angry
5178,_BURRUS._,Thus to be questioned?
5179,_BURRUS._,
5180,_BURRUS._,"_Sen._               Nay, indeed, by habit"
5181,_BURRUS._,I question oft myself.
5182,_BURRUS._,
5183,_BURRUS._,"_Bur._               Then, for one question"
5184,_BURRUS._,"I’ll be appeased. I know you, Seneca,"
5185,_BURRUS._,"For a man of many parts, a scholar, poet,"
5186,_BURRUS._,"Lawyer, and politician, what you will;                          2760"
5187,_BURRUS._,"A courtier too besides, a man of business,"
5188,_BURRUS._,"A money-maker; in short, a man of the world,"
5189,_BURRUS._,"That like a ship lifting to every wave,"
5190,_BURRUS._,"Heeling to every blast, makes good her way"
5191,_BURRUS._,And leaves no track. Now what I ask is this:
5192,_BURRUS._,"How ride so lightly with the times, and yet"
5193,_BURRUS._,"Be the unbending stoic, the philosopher,"
5194,_BURRUS._,"The rock, I say, that planted in the deep"
5195,_BURRUS._,"Moves not a hair, but sees the buffeting breakers"
5196,_BURRUS._,"Boil and withdraw? Which is the matter, Seneca?"
5197,_BURRUS._,"Nay, ’tis a pertinent and friendly question—                    2771"
5198,_BURRUS._,I’ll take your answer as we go along.
5199,_BURRUS._,
5200,_BURRUS._,[_Exeunt Burrus and Seneca._
5201,_BURRUS._,
5202,_BURRUS._,_Re-enter Fulvia._
5203,_BURRUS._,
5204,_BURRUS._,_Ful._ Of all delights I think that liberty
5205,_BURRUS._,Is the prime element: nothing is pleasant
5206,_BURRUS._,"Joined with a must. Why, even this journey hither"
5207,_BURRUS._,"That has so cheered my mistress, all the talk"
5208,_BURRUS._,"Of sky and fields and trees, tired me to death."
5209,_BURRUS._,"I’m sick of servitude, with ’time for this’"
5210,_BURRUS._,And ’time for that’: I’d give my ears for freedom;
5211,_BURRUS._,
5212,_BURRUS._,[_She sits in Agrippina’s chair._
5213,_BURRUS._,
5214,_BURRUS._,"To have my servants, and say—Prithee, Fulvia,"
5215,_BURRUS._,What is o’clock?—Fetch me the little kerchief
5216,_BURRUS._,"I left upon my bed—Come, Fulvia, quick;                         2782"
5217,_BURRUS._,"I want you—Fulvia, go, order my litter—"
5218,_BURRUS._,"Fulvia, be gone; we’ve business—Fulvia, stay,"
5219,_BURRUS._,Amuse me for a while.—I would to heaven
5220,_BURRUS._,"I were in Rome again! (_Shouts heard._) Hey, what a noise!"
5221,_BURRUS._,Cheering my lady! here’s a change indeed.
5222,_BURRUS._,"Well, I shan’t lose by that. Gods, how they cheer!"
5223,_BURRUS._,She might have taken me with her. I know well
5224,_BURRUS._,I shan’t see the outside of these villa walls                   2790
5225,_BURRUS._,"Till bound for home. And here no visitors,"
5226,_BURRUS._,"At least for me. Cheer on, my lads! and yet"
5227,_BURRUS._,If I should get the chance I’d like to see
5228,_BURRUS._,These famous Neapolitans: I’m told
5229,_BURRUS._,"They’re wondrous saucy, and ingenious singers."
5230,_BURRUS._,What’s that? a boat! my lady! gracious heavens!
5231,_BURRUS._,
5232,_BURRUS._,[_A boat rows up to quay._
5233,_BURRUS._,
5234,_BURRUS._,"My lady, O my lady, what’s the matter?"
5235,_BURRUS._,
5236,_BURRUS._,"_Enter Agrippina up from the quay, clothes dripping; the"
5237,_BURRUS._,boat remains._
5238,_BURRUS._,
5239,_BURRUS._,"_Agr._ An accident, and I am escaped by swimming:"
5240,_BURRUS._,"Yet thou must know, Fulvia, ’twas a contrivance"
5241,_BURRUS._,To take my life—the kindness was all hollow—
5242,_BURRUS._,A dastardly contrivance: ’twas the ship                         2801
5243,_BURRUS._,"Seleucus spoke of. Look, I am hurt in the shoulder,"
5244,_BURRUS._,Yet ’tis not much.
5245,_BURRUS._,
5246,_BURRUS._,"_Ful._           Alack, alack, my lady!"
5247,_BURRUS._,
5248,_BURRUS._,_Agr._ I am cold and faint. I must at once go shift
5249,_BURRUS._,These dripping habits. When I am rested somewhat
5250,_BURRUS._,"Thou shalt hear all: meanwhile, call in the sailors"
5251,_BURRUS._,Who rowed me hither: get from them whate’er
5252,_BURRUS._,"They saw or know, and promise a reward"
5253,_BURRUS._,Worthy of my deliverance.      [_Going._
5254,_BURRUS._,
5255,_BURRUS._,"_Ful._                  Praised be the gods,"
5256,_BURRUS._,"My lady, that thou’rt safe."
5257,_BURRUS._,
5258,_BURRUS._,_ Agr._ (_turning_).         Polla is killed.      [_Exit._
5259,_BURRUS._,
5260,_BURRUS._,"_Ful._ What, Polla! Killed! she said killed. Polla killed!2811"
5261,_BURRUS._,"Ho! fellows, come within, nay, come within."
5262,_BURRUS._,
5263,_BURRUS._,_Sailors enter._
5264,_BURRUS._,
5265,_SAILOR._,_SAILOR._
5266,_SAILOR._,
5267,_SAILOR._,"We are not fit, my lady. By thy leave,"
5268,_SAILOR._,We are poor fishermen.
5269,_SAILOR._,
5270,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._               Come, fellows, come."
5271,_SAILOR._,Which is the captain?
5272,_SAILOR._,
5273,_SAILOR._,"_Sail._             Me, so please thee, lady."
5274,_SAILOR._,
5275,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._ Ye have brought the empress safe, and for that service"
5276,_SAILOR._,"Shall have a good reward. But, tell me now,"
5277,_SAILOR._,How came she in your boat?
5278,_SAILOR._,
5279,_SAILOR._,"_Sail._                   ’Twas thus, my lady."
5280,_SAILOR._,"It being the feast, we smartened up the boat"
5281,_SAILOR._,"And pulled her close along the shore, to find                   2820"
5282,_SAILOR._,"A party of landsmen, such as love to visit"
5283,_SAILOR._,"Misenum, or be rowed across the bay"
5284,_SAILOR._,"To Pausilypum, lady, and Virgil’s villa."
5285,_SAILOR._,"When, as we lay, the Augusta’s galley passed,"
5286,_SAILOR._,"Not half a cable’s length, and then we cheered,"
5287,_SAILOR._,"And after took no note of her, till Gripus,"
5288,_SAILOR._,"He cries, Look! see the galley. And there she was"
5289,_SAILOR._,Laid on her beam-ends in the offing. Ho!
5290,_SAILOR._,"We cried, and gave the alarm, and led the chase"
5291,_SAILOR._,"To reach her first: when presently she righted,                 2830"
5292,_SAILOR._,"Steadied, and trimmed her oars, and drew away."
5293,_SAILOR._,While we were wondering and talking of it
5294,_SAILOR._,"I spied a something floating, and again"
5295,_SAILOR._,"Putting about, saw ’twas a swimmer’s head."
5296,_SAILOR._,Four other boats with ours made for it too;
5297,_SAILOR._,"But we gave way with a will and held our own,"
5298,_SAILOR._,"And coming alongside, found ’twas the Augusta."
5299,_SAILOR._,"I reached her out an oar, and I and my mate"
5300,_SAILOR._,Lifted her in handsomely. Then she bad us
5301,_SAILOR._,"Straight row her hither. She’s a most brave lady,"
5302,_SAILOR._,"Ay, and can swim.                                               2841"
5303,_SAILOR._,
5304,_SAILOR._,_Ful._          Know you no more?
5305,_SAILOR._,
5306,_SAILOR._,"_Sail._                         No, lady."
5307,_SAILOR._,"We looked, but saw naught else, not even a spar."
5308,_SAILOR._,The Augusta told us there was none but she.
5309,_SAILOR._,
5310,_SAILOR._,_Ful._ What was the reason why the galley heeled?
5311,_SAILOR._,
5312,_SAILOR._,_Sail._ I cannot tell.
5313,_SAILOR._,
5314,_SAILOR._,_Ful._               What could it be?
5315,_SAILOR._,
5316,_SAILOR._,"_Sail._                              D’ye see,"
5317,_SAILOR._,"My lady, ’tis the Admiral’s boat, this galley."
5318,_SAILOR._,It’s not for me....
5319,_SAILOR._,
5320,_SAILOR._,_Ful._            There’s not a breath of wind.
5321,_SAILOR._,
5322,_SAILOR._,_Sail._ The mischief was aboard.
5323,_SAILOR._,
5324,_SAILOR._,_Ful._                         You know no more?
5325,_SAILOR._,
5326,_SAILOR._,"_Sail._ Nothing, my lady."
5327,_SAILOR._,
5328,_SAILOR._,_Ful._                  Then begone; to-morrow
5329,_SAILOR._,Come for your recompense. I know not yet                        2850
5330,_SAILOR._,The Augusta’s pleasure.
5331,_SAILOR._,
5332,_SAILOR._,"_The Sailors._ Thank thee, thank thee, my lady."
5333,_SAILOR._,
5334,_SAILOR._,[_Exeunt Sailors._
5335,_SAILOR._,
5336,_SAILOR._,_Ful._ ’Tis plain the men know nothing.
5337,_SAILOR._,
5338,_SAILOR._,"_Sailor_ (_returning_).    Please thee, lady,"
5339,_SAILOR._,"If not too bold, we’ll ask thee if the Augusta"
5340,_SAILOR._,Has taken harm from being so long in the water.
5341,_SAILOR._,
5342,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._ Thank you, my men. I pray she’s none the worse."
5343,_SAILOR._,
5344,_SAILOR._,"_Sail._ ’Tis bitter cold, indeed. But I can tell"
5345,_SAILOR._,"She’s of good stuff; ay, and can swim."
5346,_SAILOR._,
5347,_SAILOR._,_Ful._                               Be sure
5348,_SAILOR._,You are fortunate to have done her this good service.
5349,_SAILOR._,
5350,_SAILOR._,_Sail._ I make my humble duties.      [_Exit._
5351,_SAILOR._,
5352,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._                         Alas, alas!"
5353,_SAILOR._,What can this mystery mean? I die to hear.                      2860
5354,_SAILOR._,I must now go attend her; ah! here she comes.
5355,_SAILOR._,
5356,_SAILOR._,_Enter Agrippina._
5357,_SAILOR._,
5358,_SAILOR._,_Agr._ Fetch me some wine and a warm coverlet;
5359,_SAILOR._,The fur one from my bed.
5360,_SAILOR._,
5361,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._                 Ay, madam, quickly.      [_Exit._"
5362,_SAILOR._,
5363,_SAILOR._,_Agr._ I have no friend here but her and the few servants
5364,_SAILOR._,Upon the place: ’tis plotted well indeed
5365,_SAILOR._,To catch me thus alone: Mistress Poppæa
5366,_SAILOR._,"Is seen in this. Yet being escaped, I think"
5367,_SAILOR._,I yet will prove her match.
5368,_SAILOR._,
5369,_SAILOR._,_Re-enter Fulvia._
5370,_SAILOR._,
5371,_SAILOR._,"Ah, thank you, so."
5372,_SAILOR._,
5373,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._ Are you recovered, madam, from the shock?"
5374,_SAILOR._,
5375,_SAILOR._,_Agr._ I am warm again. I think too that my hurt
5376,_SAILOR._,Is very little: but I am somewhat shaken.                       2871
5377,_SAILOR._,
5378,_SAILOR._,_Ful._ What is it that hath happed? The sailors knew
5379,_SAILOR._,Nothing but that they found you.
5380,_SAILOR._,
5381,_SAILOR._,_Agr._                         Did they see
5382,_SAILOR._,Nothing?
5383,_SAILOR._,
5384,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._ They saw the galley lurch, and say"
5385,_SAILOR._,The Admiral must know.
5386,_SAILOR._,
5387,_SAILOR._,_Agr._               ’Tis likely enough
5388,_SAILOR._,"’Twas his contrivance. Now I’ll tell thee all,"
5389,_SAILOR._,"Fulvia, and thou must help me all thou canst"
5390,_SAILOR._,When thou hast heard: indeed I tell thee partly
5391,_SAILOR._,"To clear my judgment.—We had rowed about a mile,"
5392,_SAILOR._,"Polla and I, and sat upon the poop,                             2880"
5393,_SAILOR._,"Taking our pleasure, when, all on a sudden,"
5394,_SAILOR._,"Darkness; the awning fell, with such a crash"
5395,_SAILOR._,"As took away my spirits, and Polla and I"
5396,_SAILOR._,Were thrown down from our couches by the weight
5397,_SAILOR._,Of falling cloth and spars: one heavy beam
5398,_SAILOR._,"Grazed my left shoulder, and we lay crushed down"
5399,_SAILOR._,"Upon the deck. Then I heard Polla laugh,"
5400,_SAILOR._,"Finding we were not hurt, and she crept forth"
5401,_SAILOR._,"Forward, beneath the curtains; the oars stopped:"
5402,_SAILOR._,"I heard a rush of feet, and presently                           2890"
5403,_SAILOR._,"Came Polla’s voice, ’Hold, slay me not, ye villains,"
5404,_SAILOR._,"I am Agrippina.’ Then, ’Ah me, I am slain!’"
5405,_SAILOR._,"And one long deathly groan. This, when I heard,"
5406,_SAILOR._,"Taught me my part, and towards the other side,"
5407,_SAILOR._,"Crawling, I came to the window o’er the stern,"
5408,_SAILOR._,"Where lay my only escape; and silently,"
5409,_SAILOR._,"Feet foremost, I crept out, and by the ladder"
5410,_SAILOR._,Slipped down without a sound into the sea.
5411,_SAILOR._,"The galley still held way, and in few strokes"
5412,_SAILOR._,I saw that I was left and unperceived;                          2900
5413,_SAILOR._,And so swam on until the fishermen
5414,_SAILOR._,"Hailed me by name, and took me in their boat."
5415,_SAILOR._,
5416,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._ Who can have laid this plot to kill you, madam?"
5417,_SAILOR._,
5418,_SAILOR._,"_Agr._ ’Tis Nero, Fulvia, he who seemed but late"
5419,_SAILOR._,"So kind and dutiful: ’twas all hollowness,"
5420,_SAILOR._,"Part of the plot, to bring me here alone,"
5421,_SAILOR._,"Away from friends: ay, and perceive this too,"
5422,_SAILOR._,"To lay my death to charge of an accident,"
5423,_SAILOR._,"And hide, maybe, even my dead body, drowned"
5424,_SAILOR._,"And lost in the depths of the sea. Now, being alone,"
5425,_SAILOR._,I shall need thee to aid me.
5426,_SAILOR._,
5427,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._                     Dearest madam,                     2911"
5428,_SAILOR._,What can I do?
5429,_SAILOR._,
5430,_SAILOR._,_Agr._       Thou must be faithful to me
5431,_SAILOR._,"Whatever happens. Hearken, I said ’twas Nero"
5432,_SAILOR._,"Had done this: ’tis not so; my real enemy,"
5433,_SAILOR._,"The mover, is Poppæa. I blame not Nero:"
5434,_SAILOR._,I bade him to discard her: he was driven
5435,_SAILOR._,To choose between us: she hath carried it.
5436,_SAILOR._,"But being escaped, and she not here, I yet"
5437,_SAILOR._,Can right myself with him. ’Tis not too late;
5438,_SAILOR._,"Nay, I can amply trust those broad affections,                  2920"
5439,_SAILOR._,Which ’twixt a mother and her son remain
5440,_SAILOR._,"At bottom, spite of all. Ay, they remain."
5441,_SAILOR._,The common knowledge of this guilty attempt
5442,_SAILOR._,"Will clear the way: and when I show the path,"
5443,_SAILOR._,"He will be glad to escape. I have writ a letter,"
5444,_SAILOR._,"Which, if he read, will work. ’Tis pure submission."
5445,_SAILOR._,"Remember, we must ever speak of this"
5446,_SAILOR._,But as an accident. Here is the letter;
5447,_SAILOR._,Send Agerinus with it straight to Cæsar;
5448,_SAILOR._,Of all my servants he’s the one must bear it:                   2930
5449,_SAILOR._,"Nero has known him from a child, will trust him;"
5450,_SAILOR._,"Nay, he hath rid so oft upon his shoulders"
5451,_SAILOR._,"That he is half a brother, half a father."
5452,_SAILOR._,Send him at once: I have bidden him await:
5453,_SAILOR._,He should be here.
5454,_SAILOR._,
5455,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._           Alas, this is a day"
5456,_SAILOR._,Of sorrow indeed. I pray Minerva guard
5457,_SAILOR._,Her feast from ill.      [_Exit with letter._
5458,_SAILOR._,
5459,_SAILOR._,"_Agr._            Indeed I have little fear,"
5460,_SAILOR._,"If he but read. Yet now, after this warning,"
5461,_SAILOR._,I must beware. ’Tis plain the people love me;                   2939
5462,_SAILOR._,They cheered me so. My escape will add to favour.
5463,_SAILOR._,
5464,_SAILOR._,"_Ful._ (_re-entering_). He waited at the gate, and with full speed"
5465,_SAILOR._,Runs with the letter.
5466,_SAILOR._,
5467,_SAILOR._,_Agr._              Come; one business
5468,_SAILOR._,Must now be not neglected; there’s poor Polla.
5469,_SAILOR._,Bring pens and ink and wax: we will seal up
5470,_SAILOR._,"All her effects, and make an inventory"
5471,_SAILOR._,"In proper form, and do whate’er we may"
5472,_SAILOR._,While we have time. Let us go see to it.      [_Exeunt._

5498,_SENECA._,"What is the business, Cæsar?"
5499,_SENECA._,
5500,_SENECA._,_Ner._                     I am vexed
5501,_SENECA._,By the complaints against the imperial household
5502,_SENECA._,In the gathering of tolls.—Here in these papers
5503,_SENECA._,Are weighty charges ’gainst Pomponius
5504,_SENECA._,"Silvanus, and Sulpicius Camerinus:"
5505,_SENECA._,Read them at leisure. But I ask you first
5506,_SENECA._,Whether there be not cause for discontent                       2960
5507,_SENECA._,In present management?
5508,_SENECA._,
5509,_SENECA._,_Sen._               ’Tis a deep evil.
5510,_SENECA._,But never was the empire better governed;
5511,_SENECA._,"Nor is there more extortion now, I think,"
5512,_SENECA._,Than ever was.
5513,_SENECA._,
5514,_SENECA._,_Ner._       And were there no extortion?
5515,_SENECA._,
5516,_SENECA._,"_Sen._ Nay, while you farm the taxes there will be"
5517,_SENECA._,Extortion still.
5518,_SENECA._,

5527,_SENECA._,"Customs or duties levied: nay, not one"
5528,_SENECA._,Through all the empire. I will make this present
5529,_SENECA._,"To the human race: I say, their old vexation"

5541,_TIGELLINUS._,"_Sen._                   The treasury,"
5542,_TIGELLINUS._,"Eased of this sum, must fill the deficit"
5543,_TIGELLINUS._,"By other means. If you cut off the customs,"
5544,_TIGELLINUS._,"You must increase the tributes, rates, and rents."

5552,_TIGELLINUS._,

5555,_TIGELLINUS._,
5556,_TIGELLINUS._,_Ner._    Whence they seemed the price of empire.
5557,_TIGELLINUS._,

5569,_TIGELLINUS._,We’ll have the rents. The land....                              2990
5570,_TIGELLINUS._,
5571,_TIGELLINUS._,_Enter Messenger with Officer of the Guard._
5572,_TIGELLINUS._,
5573,_TIGELLINUS._,"Why, who is this?"
5574,_TIGELLINUS._,"Whence come you, man?"
5575,_TIGELLINUS._,
5576,_MESSENGER._,_MESSENGER._
5577,_MESSENGER._,
5578,_MESSENGER._,"Cæsar, from Anicetus."
5579,_MESSENGER._,He asks great Cæsar’s pardon ere I tell.
5580,_MESSENGER._,
5581,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._ Thou’rt free to speak.
5582,_MESSENGER._,
5583,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._                     There has an accident
5584,_MESSENGER._,Befallen the Augusta’s yacht.
5585,_MESSENGER._,
5586,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._                      Hey! what was that?
5587,_MESSENGER._,
5588,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._ At a lurch of the ship the awning fell and dragged
5589,_MESSENGER._,The Augusta overboard.
5590,_MESSENGER._,
5591,_MESSENGER._,"_Ner._               Speak, man, speak on."
5592,_MESSENGER._,
5593,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._ We thought her drowned.
5594,_MESSENGER._,
5595,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._                        Ha!
5596,_MESSENGER._,
5597,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._                         But by the grace of the gods
5598,_MESSENGER._,She is escaped.
5599,_MESSENGER._,
5600,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._        Escaped!
5601,_MESSENGER._,
5602,_MESSENGER._,_Mess._              She swam to shore unharmed.
5603,_MESSENGER._,
5604,_MESSENGER._,"_Ner._                                         Thou wretch,"
5605,_MESSENGER._,And comest thou here in thy master’s place                      2999
5606,_MESSENGER._,To bate mine anger? Forth and send him hither.
5607,_MESSENGER._,"Fly, or I kill thee."
5608,_MESSENGER._,
5609,_MESSENGER._,"_Mess._            Pardon, great Cæsar, pardon."
5610,_MESSENGER._,The Admiral follows and will straight be here.
5611,_MESSENGER._,
5612,_MESSENGER._,[_Runs out._
5613,_MESSENGER._,
5614,_MESSENGER._,"_Ner._ (_aside_). Escaped! after such boast, escaped! I am lost.—"
5615,_MESSENGER._,To have done this thing had tried me; to have attempted it
5616,_MESSENGER._,And failed is ruin.
5617,_MESSENGER._,
5618,_MESSENGER._,_Sen._ (_aside from Nero_). What is this?
5619,_MESSENGER._,
5620,_MESSENGER._,_Bur._ (_to Sen._)                      ’Tis clear
5621,_MESSENGER._,Cæsar knows what: and her escape not being
5622,_MESSENGER._,His pleasure tells us that ’twas not his purpose.
5623,_MESSENGER._,
5624,_MESSENGER._,"_Sen._ (_aloud_). Alas, alas!"
5625,_MESSENGER._,
5626,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._                           What friend there cries Alas?
5627,_MESSENGER._,Who now stands by me? who will aid me now?
5628,_MESSENGER._,
5629,_MESSENGER._,_Tig._ If Cæsar make his will but known...
5630,_MESSENGER._,
5631,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._                                    Thou dullard!
5632,_MESSENGER._,I need the brains of them that know my will.                    3011
5633,_MESSENGER._,"Now is no time for parley. Seneca,"
5634,_MESSENGER._,Speak what thou thinkest.
5635,_MESSENGER._,
5636,_MESSENGER._,"_Sen._ Cæsar, I am so much grieved that..."
5637,_MESSENGER._,
5638,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._                                    What’s thy pain
5639,_MESSENGER._,"To mine? Speak, man!"
5640,_MESSENGER._,
5641,_MESSENGER._,"_Sen._             Alas, what shall I say?"
5642,_MESSENGER._,
5643,_MESSENGER._,"_Ner._ How hast thou guessed this thing without a word,"
5644,_MESSENGER._,And yet hast not foreseen it?
5645,_MESSENGER._,
5646,_MESSENGER._,"_Sen._                      Oh, is’t then true?"
5647,_MESSENGER._,The letter false; the Augusta hither brought
5648,_MESSENGER._,But to be drowned!
5649,_MESSENGER._,
5650,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._           See if ye know it not.
5651,_MESSENGER._,
5652,_MESSENGER._,_Sen._ Let her escape belie thy guilty purpose.               3020
5653,_MESSENGER._,
5654,_MESSENGER._,"_Ner._ Why, nay, the failure damns a thousand-fold"
5655,_MESSENGER._,More than her death—I am henceforth the man
5656,_MESSENGER._,"Who would have killed his mother, and could not."
5657,_MESSENGER._,
5658,_MESSENGER._,"_Sen._ Alas, alas!"
5659,_MESSENGER._,
5660,_MESSENGER._,_Ner._           Hast thou no word but that?
5661,_MESSENGER._,"Thou that hast ever warned me, ay, and gone"
5662,_MESSENGER._,So far upon this path that thou hast sought
5663,_MESSENGER._,To dull the natural feeling which so long
5664,_MESSENGER._,"Held off my hand, hast argued ’gainst repugnance,"
5665,_MESSENGER._,"Crying, ’tis she that is the guilty one,                        3029"
5666,_MESSENGER._,"The dangerous one, there is no peace with her:"
5667,_MESSENGER._,"And now the day the thing thou hast foreseen,"
5668,_MESSENGER._,"Ay, and hast led me to, is done, thou’rt silent."
5669,_MESSENGER._,"Hast thou no word?—Thou that wast ever ready,"
5670,_MESSENGER._,Hast thou no word?—What strikes thee on a sudden
5671,_MESSENGER._,Dumb? Be my counsellor now that I need thee.
5672,_MESSENGER._,"Speak now! Why, thou dost weep! surely thou weepest!"
5673,_MESSENGER._,"Burrus, what sayest thou?"
5674,_MESSENGER._,
5675,_MESSENGER._,"_Bur._                  This mischief, Cæsar,"
5676,_MESSENGER._,Being thus arisen is the Augusta’s death.
5677,_MESSENGER._,"Though I bewail the occasion, yet I say"
5678,_MESSENGER._,’Twere most untimely justice to endanger                        3040
5679,_MESSENGER._,The public peace for her whose life hath been
5680,_MESSENGER._,So long the shame of justice. Since the sentence
5681,_MESSENGER._,"We know is just, and that necessity"
5682,_MESSENGER._,"O’errides the common forms, the less delay"
5683,_MESSENGER._,The better. Let her die.
5684,_MESSENGER._,
5685,_MESSENGER._,"_Ner._                 I thank thee, Burrus."
5686,_MESSENGER._,How were this best performed?
5687,_MESSENGER._,
5688,_MESSENGER._,"_Tig._                      Now, if none speak,"
5689,_MESSENGER._,"I’ll say that Burrus, being the advocate"
5690,_MESSENGER._,"Of what is planned, and as pretorian prefect"
5691,_MESSENGER._,"Possessed of means, is fittest for the work."
5692,_MESSENGER._,
5693,_MESSENGER._,"_Bur._ Look not on me, Seneca, as if to say                   3050"
5694,_MESSENGER._,’Tis well; as if ’twere thy thought that my office
5695,_MESSENGER._,"Covered this deed. I pardon Tigellinus,"
5696,_MESSENGER._,"That, unacquainted with a soldier’s honour,"
5697,_MESSENGER._,"He thinks it passable in time of peace,"
5698,_MESSENGER._,Entering in private houses there to slay
5699,_MESSENGER._,Defenceless citizens. But that the guards
5700,_MESSENGER._,Would thus lay hands on one that bears the name
5701,_MESSENGER._,"Of Agrippina, that they could forget"
5702,_MESSENGER._,"Their loved Germanicus, who would think this?"
5703,_MESSENGER._,"To such a deed they would not follow me,                        3060"
5704,_MESSENGER._,Far less another; and if Cæsar now
5705,_MESSENGER._,"Look for it from me, lo, I here throw down"
5706,_MESSENGER._,My prefecture to any man soe’er
5707,_MESSENGER._,Who durst with this condition take it up.
5708,_MESSENGER._,
5709,_MESSENGER._,"_Ner._ Nay, Burrus, I’ll not ask thee that. Thou’rt right."
5710,_MESSENGER._,"And yet, if thou could’st do it— See here the man."
5711,_MESSENGER._,
5712,_MESSENGER._,"_Enter Anicetus in haste, Paris following._"
5713,_MESSENGER._,
5714,_MESSENGER._,Thou hast been my ruin!
5715,_MESSENGER._,
5716,_ANICETUS._,_ANICETUS._
5717,_ANICETUS._,
5718,_ANICETUS._,"Pardon, Cæsar, pardon."
5719,_ANICETUS._,"I am strangely foiled. Give me one hour, and yet"
5720,_ANICETUS._,I’ll make amends.
5721,_ANICETUS._,
5722,_ANICETUS._,"_Ner._          If thou canst make amends,"
5723,_ANICETUS._,"Come hither, speak with me.      [_They go aside to front._"
5724,_ANICETUS._,
5725,_ANICETUS._,_Bur._               Is the thing known?
5726,_ANICETUS._,
5727,_PARIS._,_PARIS._
5728,_PARIS._,
5729,_PARIS._,Ay ay.
5730,_PARIS._,
5731,_PARIS._,_Ner._ (_to Anic._) What canst thou do?
5732,_PARIS._,
5733,_PARIS._,_Ani._                              I have set a guard        3071
5734,_PARIS._,"Around her villa, fearing lest the people"
5735,_PARIS._,"Should force their way within, or she escape."
5736,_PARIS._,Give me the word and I will slay her there.
5737,_PARIS._,
5738,_PARIS._,"_Ner._ Fool, I can give no word. Think when ’tis done,"
5739,_PARIS._,If I should punish thee less for that deed
5740,_PARIS._,Than for thy late misdoing. What is this?
5741,_PARIS._,
5742,_PARIS._,_Enter Officer of the Guard. Petronius follows._

5748,_OFFICER._,
5749,_OFFICER._,_Ner._ (_to Anic._)          Now
5750,_OFFICER._,What to do?
5751,_OFFICER._,
5752,_OFFICER._,_Ani._  Bid him enter: when he comes                          3080
5753,_OFFICER._,"I am prepared. Lend me thy dagger, friend (_to Tig._)."
5754,_OFFICER._,

5763,_AGERINUS._,_Ani._                 Ha! where’s thy hand?
5764,_AGERINUS._,"Ay, as I thought, a dagger well concealed"
5765,_AGERINUS._,Under his cloak.
5766,_AGERINUS._,
5767,_AGERINUS._,"_Age._         Indeed, indeed, good sir,"
5768,_AGERINUS._,I have no dagger.
5769,_AGERINUS._,
5770,_AGERINUS._,_Ani._          How no dagger? See!
5771,_AGERINUS._,"Had I not caught thee! Ho! the guard, the guard!"
5772,_AGERINUS._,Take him to prison till he can be questioned.
5773,_AGERINUS._,
5774,_AGERINUS._,_Age._ You do force treason on me. Cæsar! Cæsar!

5777,_AGERINUS._,
5778,_AGERINUS._,"_Ani._ This villain having come, as he confessed,"
5779,_AGERINUS._,"From the empress armed, will Cæsar leave the enquiry"
5780,_AGERINUS._,Now in my hands?
5781,_AGERINUS._,
5782,_AGERINUS._,_Ner._         I do.
5783,_AGERINUS._,
5784,_AGERINUS._,_Ani._             With me who will!                          3091

5793,_PETRONIUS._,What will they go to do?
5794,_PETRONIUS._,
5795,_PETRONIUS._,_Bur._                 ’Tis thus: the Admiral
5796,_PETRONIUS._,Has gone to kill the Augusta.
5797,_PETRONIUS._,
5798,_PETRONIUS._,_Petr._                     Gods forbid!
5799,_PETRONIUS._,His orders?
5800,_PETRONIUS._,
5801,_PETRONIUS._,_Bur._    Humph!
5802,_PETRONIUS._,
5803,_PETRONIUS._,"_Petr._        Why, men, what thing ye do!"
5804,_PETRONIUS._,He is shamed for ever.
5805,_PETRONIUS._,
5806,_PETRONIUS._,"_Bur._               Ay, and were’t not done"
5807,_PETRONIUS._,Were shamed no less.
5808,_PETRONIUS._,
5809,_PETRONIUS._,"_Sen._             Alas! ’tis true, ’tis true."
5810,_PETRONIUS._,"And thou wert right, Burrus; but dost thou well"
5811,_PETRONIUS._,Permitting this?
5812,_PETRONIUS._,
5813,_PETRONIUS._,"_Bur._         I see ’tis necessary,"
5814,_PETRONIUS._,And am not shamed to say I think the thing                      3100
5815,_PETRONIUS._,"Itself is good. As for the motives, Seneca,"
5816,_PETRONIUS._,"Ay, and the manner of it, to defend them"
5817,_PETRONIUS._,I shall not meddle.
5818,_PETRONIUS._,
5819,_PETRONIUS._,_Petr._ (_to Sen._) And thou wilt take thy share?
5820,_PETRONIUS._,
5821,_PETRONIUS._,_Sen._ ’Tis not my counsel.
5822,_PETRONIUS._,
5823,_PETRONIUS._,"_Petr._                   ’Twill be held as thine,"
5824,_PETRONIUS._,"And rightly, seeing that thou let it not."
5825,_PETRONIUS._,I could have stayed it.
5826,_PETRONIUS._,
5827,_PETRONIUS._,"_Bur._                Nay, be not so sure."
5828,_PETRONIUS._,"And if thou could’st have let it, could’st thou too"
5829,_PETRONIUS._,Prevent the consequences?
5830,_PETRONIUS._,
5831,_PETRONIUS._,"_Petr._                 But remember,"
5832,_PETRONIUS._,"She is his mother. Oh, I thought him better."
5833,_PETRONIUS._,"Is it too late now think you, if I ran...                       3110"
5834,_PETRONIUS._,
5835,_PETRONIUS._,_Bur._ They are there by now. Believe ’tis for the best.
5836,_PETRONIUS._,"If she should live but till to-morrow morn,"
5837,_PETRONIUS._,’Tis civil war. Consider what a party
5838,_PETRONIUS._,"Would stir upon the tale of Claudius’ death,"
5839,_PETRONIUS._,Or to revenge Britannicus. I say
5840,_PETRONIUS._,There’s nought to gain.
5841,_PETRONIUS._,
5842,_PETRONIUS._,"_Petr._               Why, ’tis his mother, Burrus,"
5843,_PETRONIUS._,His mother. I’ll be sworn he had not dared
5844,_PETRONIUS._,Thus to commit himself had I been by.
5845,_PETRONIUS._,"He that should be a model to the world,"
5846,_PETRONIUS._,"The mirror of good manners, to offend                           3120"
5847,_PETRONIUS._,Thus against taste!
5848,_PETRONIUS._,
5849,_PETRONIUS._,_Bur._            If ’twere no worse...
5850,_PETRONIUS._,
5851,_PETRONIUS._,"_Petr._                               Why, see,"
5852,_PETRONIUS._,"There are a hundred subtle ways by which,"
5853,_PETRONIUS._,"Had Cæsar done the thing, he had not been blamed."
5854,_PETRONIUS._,This vulgar butchery displays to all
5855,_PETRONIUS._,"The motive, which so hurts your sense of right"
5856,_PETRONIUS._,"That ye neglect the manner. Why, I say,"
5857,_PETRONIUS._,A just attention to the circumstance
5858,_PETRONIUS._,"Would hide the doing; but thus done, the doing"
5859,_PETRONIUS._,Proclaims the deed. And is’t not plain that ye
5860,_PETRONIUS._,"Must share the guilt? Seneca, look for that.                    3130"
5861,_PETRONIUS._,
5862,_PETRONIUS._,"_Sen._ ’Tis very well for you, Petronius,"
5863,_PETRONIUS._,To take upon yourself the criticism
5864,_PETRONIUS._,"And ordering of appearances, and say"
5865,_PETRONIUS._,"’If aught goes ill, blame me.’ You lay your hand"
5866,_PETRONIUS._,"On any object you mislike, remove it,"
5867,_PETRONIUS._,"Replace it as you will, can please yourself:"
5868,_PETRONIUS._,"Nay, you can blame their taste who are not pleased."
5869,_PETRONIUS._,"But he who deals with men, and seeks to mould"
5870,_PETRONIUS._,A character to that high rule of right
5871,_PETRONIUS._,"Which so few can attain, he works, I say,                       3140"
5872,_PETRONIUS._,"With different matter, nor can he be blamed"
5873,_PETRONIUS._,By any measure of his ill success.
5874,_PETRONIUS._,His best endeavours are like little dams
5875,_PETRONIUS._,"Built ’gainst the ocean, on a sinking shore."
5876,_PETRONIUS._,Nature asserts her force—and the wise man
5877,_PETRONIUS._,"Blames not himself for his defeat. For me,"
5878,_PETRONIUS._,"Much as my soul is grieved, ay, and my pride"
5879,_PETRONIUS._,"Wounded—tho’ yet, I thank philosophy,"
5880,_PETRONIUS._,"I can be glad for that,—my hopes—for this"
5881,_PETRONIUS._,"I mourn—my hopes blasted; yet, hear me say,"
5882,_PETRONIUS._,"I take unto myself no self-reproach,                            3151"
5883,_PETRONIUS._,"Nay, not a tittle of the part of mischief"
5884,_PETRONIUS._,A vulgar mind might credit to my score.
5885,_PETRONIUS._,"I have done my best, and that’s the utmost good"
5886,_PETRONIUS._,A man can do; and if a better man
5887,_PETRONIUS._,"Had in my place done more, ’tis perverse Fortune"
5888,_PETRONIUS._,"That placed me ill. Thus far I argue with you,"
5889,_PETRONIUS._,"Who look on me askance, and think my heart"
5890,_PETRONIUS._,Is tainted; as if I would in such case
5891,_PETRONIUS._,"Do such thing, as—poison my brother at table,"
5892,_PETRONIUS._,Contrive to kill my mother: ’Tis so far                         3161
5893,_PETRONIUS._,"From possible, that to my ears the words"
5894,_PETRONIUS._,"Carry no sense: nay, and I think such crimes"
5895,_PETRONIUS._,"May seem more horrible to other men,"
5896,_PETRONIUS._,"Whose passions make them fear them, than to me"
5897,_PETRONIUS._,"Who cannot think them mine. As for the rest,"
5898,_PETRONIUS._,"I stand with you, and never from this hour"
5899,_PETRONIUS._,Shall mix with Cæsar more with any hope
5900,_PETRONIUS._,"Of good. Indeed I have hoped too long, and yet"
5901,_PETRONIUS._,The end has come too soon.                                      3170

5919,_PETRONIUS._,_Petr._             And why wentest thou
5920,_PETRONIUS._,To soil thy hand?
5921,_PETRONIUS._,
5922,_PETRONIUS._,_Par._          I went not to take part:
5923,_PETRONIUS._,"But Fortune holding nature’s ruffians up,"
5924,_PETRONIUS._,I took their pattern.
5925,_PETRONIUS._,
5926,_PETRONIUS._,"_Sen._              Say, who did the deed?"
5927,_PETRONIUS._,
5928,_PETRONIUS._,"_Par._ I’ll tell thee what I saw. As forth we went,"
5929,_PETRONIUS._,"The coward Tigellinus, pale as death,"
5930,_PETRONIUS._,"In needless haste foremost where was no danger,"
5931,_PETRONIUS._,"Hurried us on so fast, that thro’ the street                    3181"
5932,_PETRONIUS._,"We scarce kept pace, but when he reached the wall"
5933,_PETRONIUS._,"Of the garden, and saw there the soldiers placed"
5934,_PETRONIUS._,"By Anicetus, knowing not their purpose,"
5935,_PETRONIUS._,He shrank behind. These men being bidden seized
5936,_PETRONIUS._,"The servants; then we entered, and with us"
5937,_PETRONIUS._,Came the centurion. Within the room
5938,_PETRONIUS._,"Sat Agrippina with a single maid,"
5939,_PETRONIUS._,Who seeing the Admiral’s sword fled past us out:
5940,_PETRONIUS._,"At which the Augusta called to her, ’Dost thou,"
5941,_PETRONIUS._,"Fulvia, desert me too?’ Then to the Admiral                     3191"
5942,_PETRONIUS._,She spoke. ’If here thou comest to enquire
5943,_PETRONIUS._,"From Cæsar of my health, know I am well,"
5944,_PETRONIUS._,"Recovered from my shock, and little hurt."
5945,_PETRONIUS._,"But if, as your men’s looks would mean, ye are come"
5946,_PETRONIUS._,Deeming that Cæsar wills that I should suffer
5947,_PETRONIUS._,"The like I late escaped, know you mistake."
5948,_PETRONIUS._,"’Twas not of his contrivance, and my foe"
5949,_PETRONIUS._,"In this is his.’ None answered, and awhile"
5950,_PETRONIUS._,Was such delay as makes the indivisible                         3200
5951,_PETRONIUS._,And smallest point of time various and broad;
5952,_PETRONIUS._,"For Agrippina, when she saw her lie"
5953,_PETRONIUS._,"Fail of its aim, ventured no more, as knowing"
5954,_PETRONIUS._,There was no wiser plea; but let her eyes
5955,_PETRONIUS._,"Indifferently wander round her foes,"
5956,_PETRONIUS._,Counting their strength. Then looked I to have seen
5957,_PETRONIUS._,"Her spring, for her cheek swelled, and ’neath her robe"
5958,_PETRONIUS._,"Her foot moved; ay, and had she been but armed,"
5959,_PETRONIUS._,One would have fallen. But if she had the thought
5960,_PETRONIUS._,"She set it by, choosing to take her death                       3210"
5961,_PETRONIUS._,With dignity. Then Anicetus raised
5962,_PETRONIUS._,"His sword, and I fled out beyond the door"
5963,_PETRONIUS._,"To see no more. First Tigellinus’ voice,"
5964,_PETRONIUS._,"’To death, thou wretch!’ then blows, but not a groan;"
5965,_PETRONIUS._,"Only she showed her spirit to the last,"
5966,_PETRONIUS._,"And made some choice of death, offering her body,"
5967,_PETRONIUS._,"’That bare the monster,’ crying with that curse,"
5968,_PETRONIUS._,"’Strike here, strike here!’"
5969,_PETRONIUS._,
5970,_PETRONIUS._,"_Sen._                    Alas, poor lady,"
5971,_PETRONIUS._,"Was that the end of thy unscrupulous,                           3219"
5972,_PETRONIUS._,Towering ambition? Thou didst win indeed
5973,_PETRONIUS._,The best and worst of Fortune.
5974,_PETRONIUS._,
5975,_PETRONIUS._,"_Bur._                       Give her her due,"
5976,_PETRONIUS._,"Such courage as deserved the best, such crimes"
5977,_PETRONIUS._,As make her death seem gentler than deserved.
5978,_PETRONIUS._,
5979,_PETRONIUS._,_Enter Nero between Anicetus and Tigellinus._
5980,_PETRONIUS._,
5981,_PETRONIUS._,"_Ner._ My lords, ’tis done. Nay, look not grieved. There’s none"
5982,_PETRONIUS._,Suffers as much as I; all share the good.
5983,_PETRONIUS._,And think not that to keep the world at peace
5984,_PETRONIUS._,I grudge this sacrifice: the general care
5985,_PETRONIUS._,"I set before my own, and therefore bid"
5986,_PETRONIUS._,"There be no public mourning, nay, to-morrow"
5987,_PETRONIUS._,"We shall attend the spectacles and games,                       3230"
5988,_PETRONIUS._,Appear as usual before the people:
5989,_PETRONIUS._,"Ay, and I partly look, my lords, to you"
5990,_PETRONIUS._,That I be well received. Good night to all!

6053,_THETIS._,"A long and easy life, the worse a death"

6160,_ULYSSES._,"Against his host, the Spartan Menelaus,"

6172,_ULYSSES._,"Of Scyros, in the court of Lycomedes.                            119"
6173,_ULYSSES._,"The king denied the charge, adding in challenge,"

6178,_ULYSSES._,"Why search we not the court if he be there,"

6180,_ULYSSES._,
6181,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._                   ’Tis that I come to.
6182,_ULYSSES._,King Lycomedes hath been one of those
6183,_ULYSSES._,"Who have held their arms aloof from our alliance,"
6184,_ULYSSES._,On the main plea of this Achilles’ absence.

6186,_ULYSSES._,And hide the lad lest they be forced to fight?
6187,_ULYSSES._,
6188,_ULYSSES._,"_Dio._ That well might be. And if the king would hide him, 130"
6189,_ULYSSES._,Thy hope would hit upon him thus at hazard?
6190,_ULYSSES._,
6191,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ Call me not fool. Attend and hear my plot:
6192,_ULYSSES._,"Nor marvel, Diomede, to learn that he,"
6193,_ULYSSES._,"Whom the high gods name champion of the Greeks,"
6194,_ULYSSES._,Lurks in the habit of a girl disguised
6195,_ULYSSES._,Amid the maidens of this island court.
6196,_ULYSSES._,
6197,_ULYSSES._,_Dio._ That were too strange. How guess you that?

6199,_ULYSSES._,"_Ul._                                             My spies,"
6200,_ULYSSES._,"Who have searched the isle, say there’s no youth thereon,"
6201,_ULYSSES._,"Having Achilles’ age of sixteen years,"
6202,_ULYSSES._,But is well known of native parentage.                           140
6203,_ULYSSES._,"Now Thetis’ son must be of wondrous beauty,"
6204,_ULYSSES._,That could not scape inquiry; we therefore look
6205,_ULYSSES._,"For what is hid, and not to be disguised"
6206,_ULYSSES._,Save as I guess.
6207,_ULYSSES._,
6208,_ULYSSES._,"_Dio._         If this be so, thy purpose"
6209,_ULYSSES._,Is darker still.
6210,_ULYSSES._,
6211,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._          I lead thee by the steps
6212,_ULYSSES._,"I came myself to take, slowly and surely..."
6213,_ULYSSES._,"And next this, that ’twere dull to ask the king"
6214,_ULYSSES._,To help to find the thing he goes to hide:
6215,_ULYSSES._,Therefore the search must be without his knowledge.
6216,_ULYSSES._,"’Twas thus I sent up Abas to the court,                          150"
6217,_ULYSSES._,"Idly to engage him in preliminaries,"
6218,_ULYSSES._,"The while I work; my only hope being this,"
6219,_ULYSSES._,To come myself to parley with the maidens;
6220,_ULYSSES._,Which to procure I brought with me aboard
6221,_ULYSSES._,"A pedlar’s gear, and with such gawds and trinkets"
6222,_ULYSSES._,"As tickle girlish fancies, I shall steal"
6223,_ULYSSES._,Upon them at their play; my hoary beard
6224,_ULYSSES._,And rags will set them at their ease; and while
6225,_ULYSSES._,"They come about me, and turn o’er my pack,"
6226,_ULYSSES._,"I spy. If then Achilles be among them,                           160"
6227,_ULYSSES._,The lad’s indifference soon will mark him out;
6228,_ULYSSES._,"When, watching my occasion, I’ll exhibit"
6229,_ULYSSES._,Something that should provoke his eye and tongue.
6230,_ULYSSES._,"If he betray himself, thou being at hand...."
6231,_ULYSSES._,
6232,_ULYSSES._,"_Dio._ Why, ’tis a dirty trick."
6233,_ULYSSES._,
6234,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._                         Not if it wins.

6238,_ULYSSES._,
6239,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._                    No better way.
6240,_ULYSSES._,
6241,_ULYSSES._,_Dio._ The better way were not to lose the hour
6242,_ULYSSES._,"Hearkening to oracles, while our good ships"
6243,_ULYSSES._,"Rot, and our men grow stale. Why, you may see"
6244,_ULYSSES._,Imperial Agamemnon in the eyes                                   171
6245,_ULYSSES._,Of all his armament walk daily forth
6246,_ULYSSES._,To take fresh note of sparrows and of snakes:
6247,_ULYSSES._,"And if he spy an eagle, ’twill make talk"
6248,_ULYSSES._,"For twenty days. Would you have oracles,"
6249,_ULYSSES._,Give me the whipping of the priests. Zeus help me!
6250,_ULYSSES._,"If half the chiefs knew but their minds as I,"
6251,_ULYSSES._,There’d be no parleying. I’ll to war alone
6252,_ULYSSES._,And with my eighty ships do what I may
6253,_ULYSSES._,"’Gainst gods and men. Ay, and the greater odds"
6254,_ULYSSES._,The better fighting.
6255,_ULYSSES._,
6256,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._              Now ’tis thou that talkest.                 181
6257,_ULYSSES._,
6258,_ULYSSES._,_Dio._ Tell me then why we are prowling on this hill.
6259,_ULYSSES._,
6260,_ULYSSES._,_Ul._ Excellent reasons. First that when I come
6261,_ULYSSES._,"I may know how to come, and where to hide"
6262,_ULYSSES._,"From them I would not meet: and thereto this,"
6263,_ULYSSES._,"That if Achilles fly, he should not take us"
6264,_ULYSSES._,"At too great disadvantage: thou mayst head him,"
6265,_ULYSSES._,"Knowing the ground about, while I pursue."
6266,_ULYSSES._,"He must not scape. But hark, ’tis time the plot"
6267,_ULYSSES._,Were put to proof; already it must be noon;                      190
6268,_ULYSSES._,And I hear steps and voices. Let us return
6269,_ULYSSES._,"To the ship. If they that come be those we seek, ..."
6270,_ULYSSES._,"Hark, and ’tis they,—we can look back upon them."
6271,_ULYSSES._,I’ll be amongst them soon.
6272,_ULYSSES._,
6273,_ULYSSES._,_Dio._                   ’Tis a girl’s game.
6274,_ULYSSES._,
6275,_ULYSSES._,[_Exeunt into the bushes._
6276,_ULYSSES._,
6277,_ULYSSES._,"_Enter Deidamia, Achilles as Pyrrha, with the chorus of"
6278,_ULYSSES._,maidens._
6279,_ULYSSES._,
6280,_ULYSSES._,_DEIDAMIA_ (_without_).
6281,_ULYSSES._,

6287,_CHORUS._,
6288,_CHORUS._,"_Deid._ Follow me, follow."
6289,_CHORUS._,
6290,_CHORUS._,"_Ch._ We come, we come."
6291,_CHORUS._,
6292,_CHORUS._,_Deid._ Here is my home;
6293,_CHORUS._,I choose this tree: this is the ground                           200
6294,_CHORUS._,"Where we will make our play. Stand all around,"
6295,_CHORUS._,And let us beg the dwellers in this glade
6296,_CHORUS._,"To bear us company. Be not afraid,"
6297,_CHORUS._,"(I will begin) sweet birds, whose flowery songs"
6298,_CHORUS._,"Sprinkle with joy the budding boughs above,"
6299,_CHORUS._,"The airy city where your light folk throngs,"
6300,_CHORUS._,"Each with his special exquisite of love,—"
6301,_CHORUS._,"Red-throat and white-throat, finch and golden-crest,"
6302,_CHORUS._,"Deep-murmuring pigeon, and soft-cooing dove,—"
6303,_CHORUS._,"Unto his mate addrest, that close in nest                        210"
6304,_CHORUS._,Sits on the dun and dappled eggs all day.
6305,_CHORUS._,"Come red-throat, white-throat, finch and golden-crest,"
6306,_CHORUS._,Let not our merry play drive you away.
6307,_CHORUS._,
6308,_CHORUS._,"_Ch._ And ye brown squirrels, up the rugged bark"
6309,_CHORUS._,"That fly, and leap from bending spray to spray,"
6310,_CHORUS._,"And bite the luscious shoots, if I should mark,"
6311,_CHORUS._,"Slip not behind the trunks, nor hide away.—"
6312,_CHORUS._,"Ye earthy moles, that burrowing in the dark"
6313,_CHORUS._,Your glossy velvet coats so much abuse;—                         219
6314,_CHORUS._,"Ye watchful dormice, and small skipping shrews,"
6315,_CHORUS._,Stay not from foraging; dive not from sight.—
6316,_CHORUS._,"Come moles and mice, squirrels and skipping shrews,"
6317,_CHORUS._,"Come all, come forth, and join in our delight."
6318,_CHORUS._,
6319,_CHORUS._,_Deid._ Enough. Now while the Dryads of the hill
6320,_CHORUS._,"Interpret to the creatures our good will,"
6321,_CHORUS._,"Listen, and I will tell you a new game"
6322,_CHORUS._,"That we can play together.—As hither I came,"
6323,_CHORUS._,"I marked that in the hazel copse below,"
6324,_CHORUS._,Where we so oft have hidden and loved to go
6325,_CHORUS._,"To hear the night-bird, or to take unseen                        230"
6326,_CHORUS._,"Our noontide walks beneath the tangled screen,"
6327,_CHORUS._,"The woodcutter hath been with cruel blade,"
6328,_CHORUS._,And of the tasselled plumes his strewage made:
6329,_CHORUS._,And by the mossy moots the covert shorn
6330,_CHORUS._,Now lieth low in swathe like autumn corn.
6331,_CHORUS._,"These ere he lop and into bundles bind,"
6332,_CHORUS._,"Let us go choose the fairest we may find,"
6333,_CHORUS._,And of their feathered orphan saplings weave
6334,_CHORUS._,"A bowery dome, until the birds believe"
6335,_CHORUS._,"We build a nest, and are come here to dwell.                     240"
6336,_CHORUS._,"Hie forth, ye Scyrian maids; do as I tell:"
6337,_CHORUS._,"And having built our bower amid the green,"
6338,_CHORUS._,"We will choose one among us for a queen,"
6339,_CHORUS._,"And be the Amazons, whose maiden clan"
6340,_CHORUS._,"By broad Thermodon dwells, apart from man;"
6341,_CHORUS._,"Who rule themselves, from his dominion free,"
6342,_CHORUS._,"And do all things he doth, better than he."
6343,_CHORUS._,"First, Amazons, your queen: to choose her now:"
6344,_CHORUS._,Who shall she be?
6345,_CHORUS._,
6346,_CHORUS._,"_Ch._           Thyself, thou. Who but thou?"
6347,_CHORUS._,Deidamia.
6348,_CHORUS._,
6349,_CHORUS._,"_Deid._   Where then were the play,                            250"
6350,_CHORUS._,"If I should still command, and ye obey?"
6351,_CHORUS._,
6352,_CHORUS._,_Ch._ Choose thou for all.
6353,_CHORUS._,
6354,_CHORUS._,"_Deid._                  Nor will I name her, lest"
6355,_CHORUS._,Ye say my favour sets one o’er the rest.
6356,_CHORUS._,
6357,_CHORUS._,_Ch._ Thy choice is ours.
6358,_CHORUS._,
6359,_CHORUS._,_Deid._                 If then I gave my voice
6360,_CHORUS._,For Pyrrha?
6361,_CHORUS._,
6362,_CHORUS._,"_Ch._     Pyrrha, Pyrrha is our choice."
6363,_CHORUS._,"Hail, Pyrrha, hail! Queen of the Amazons!"
6364,_CHORUS._,
6365,_CHORUS._,"_Deid._ (_To Ach._). To thee I abdicate my place, and give"
6366,_CHORUS._,"My wreath for crown. Long, my queen, mayst thou live!"
6367,_CHORUS._,"Now, fellow-subjects, hie we off at once."
6368,_CHORUS._,
6369,_ACHILLES._,_ACHILLES._
6370,_ACHILLES._,
6371,_ACHILLES._,"Stay, stay! Is this the privilege of the throne?                 260"
6372,_ACHILLES._,Am I preferred but to be left alone?
6373,_ACHILLES._,"No guard, no counsellor, no company!"
6374,_ACHILLES._,"Deidamia, stay!"
6375,_ACHILLES._,
6376,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._        Thy word must be
6377,_ACHILLES._,"My law, O queen: I will abide. But ye"
6378,_ACHILLES._,"Forth quickly, as I said; ye know the place."
6379,_ACHILLES._,
6380,_ACHILLES._,"_Ch._  Follow me, follow: I lead the race."
6381,_ACHILLES._,"Follow, we follow, we give thee chase."
6382,_ACHILLES._,"Follow me, follow."
6383,_ACHILLES._,"We come, we come.      [_Exeunt Chor._"
6384,_ACHILLES._,
6385,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._ I could not bear that thou shouldst strain thy hands270
6386,_ACHILLES._,Dragging those branches up the sunny hill;
6387,_ACHILLES._,"Nor for a thousand honours thou shouldst do me,"
6388,_ACHILLES._,"Making me here thy queen, would I consent"
6389,_ACHILLES._,"To lose thy company, even for an hour."
6390,_ACHILLES._,"See, while the maids warm in their busy play,"
6391,_ACHILLES._,"We may enjoy in quiet the sweet air,"
6392,_ACHILLES._,And thro’ the quivering golden green look up
6393,_ACHILLES._,"To the deep sky, and have high thoughts as idle"
6394,_ACHILLES._,"And bright, as are the small white clouds becalmed"
6395,_ACHILLES._,In disappointed voyage to the noon:                              280
6396,_ACHILLES._,There is no better pastime.
6397,_ACHILLES._,
6398,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._                   I will sit with thee
6399,_ACHILLES._,"In idleness, while idleness can please."
6400,_ACHILLES._,
6401,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._ It is not idleness to steep the soul
6402,_ACHILLES._,In nature’s beauty: rather every day
6403,_ACHILLES._,We are idle letting beauteous things go by
6404,_ACHILLES._,"Unheld, or scarce perceived. We cannot dream"
6405,_ACHILLES._,"Too deeply, nor o’erprize the mood of love,"
6406,_ACHILLES._,"When it comes on us strongly, and the hour"
6407,_ACHILLES._,Is ripe for thought.
6408,_ACHILLES._,
6409,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._            I have a thought, a dream;"
6410,_ACHILLES._,If thou canst keep it secret.
6411,_ACHILLES._,
6412,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._               I am thy slave.                           290
6413,_ACHILLES._,
6414,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._ Suppose—’tis more than that, yet I’ll but say"
6415,_ACHILLES._,Suppose—we played this game of Amazons
6416,_ACHILLES._,In earnest. What an isle this Scyros were;
6417,_ACHILLES._,"Rich and wellplanted, and its rocky coast"
6418,_ACHILLES._,Easy of defence: the women now upon it
6419,_ACHILLES._,"Could hold it. Nay, I have often thought it out:"
6420,_ACHILLES._,"The king my sire is threescore years and more,"
6421,_ACHILLES._,"And hath no heir: suppose that when he dies,—"
6422,_ACHILLES._,"The gods defer it long, but when he dies,"
6423,_ACHILLES._,"If thou and I should plan to seize this isle,                    300"
6424,_ACHILLES._,"Drive out the men, and rule it for our own ..."
6425,_ACHILLES._,"Wouldst thou work with me, Pyrrha, the thing could be."
6426,_ACHILLES._,Why shouldst thou smile? I do not say that I
6427,_ACHILLES._,Would rate my strength with men; but on the farms
6428,_ACHILLES._,Women are thicker sinewed; and in thee
6429,_ACHILLES._,I see what all might be. I am sure for speed
6430,_ACHILLES._,"No man could match thee, and thou hast an arm"
6431,_ACHILLES._,"To tug an oar or hurl the heaviest spear,"
6432,_ACHILLES._,Or wrestle with the best. Why dost thou smile?
6433,_ACHILLES._,
6434,_ACHILLES._,"_Ach._ When thou art queen, I’ll be thy general."
6435,_ACHILLES._,
6436,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._ That was my thought. What dost thou think?
6437,_ACHILLES._,
6438,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._                                           I think
6439,_ACHILLES._,That Fate hath marked me for a general.                          312
6440,_ACHILLES._,
6441,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._ Nay, but I jest not."
6442,_ACHILLES._,
6443,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._                     Then shall I forecast
6444,_ACHILLES._,And weigh impediments against thee? as men
6445,_ACHILLES._,"Will in like case, who think no scheme mature"
6446,_ACHILLES._,Till counsel hath forestalled all obstacles.
6447,_ACHILLES._,
6448,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._ If thou canst think of any.
6449,_ACHILLES._,
6450,_ACHILLES._,"_Ach._                            First is this,"
6451,_ACHILLES._,Whence shall we get our subjects when our isle
6452,_ACHILLES._,Is peopled but by women?
6453,_ACHILLES._,
6454,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._                Fairly asked,"
6455,_ACHILLES._,Had I not thought of it. We shall import them                    320
6456,_ACHILLES._,From other isles. Girl children everywhere
6457,_ACHILLES._,"Are held of small account: these we will buy,"
6458,_ACHILLES._,"Bartering for them our fruits and tapestries,"
6459,_ACHILLES._,And chiefly from the country whence thou comest;
6460,_ACHILLES._,For there I think the women must be taller
6461,_ACHILLES._,And stronger than with us.
6462,_ACHILLES._,
6463,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._                   And who will act
6464,_ACHILLES._,Persuader to the maidens of the isle
6465,_ACHILLES._,To banish all their lovers?
6466,_ACHILLES._,
6467,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._                   O Pyrrha, shame!"
6468,_ACHILLES._,Man’s love is nothing; what knowst thou of it
6469,_ACHILLES._,To magnify its folly? ’Tis a mischief                            330
6470,_ACHILLES._,To thwart our good: therefore I banish it.
6471,_ACHILLES._,A woman’s love may be as much to woman
6472,_ACHILLES._,As a man’s love can be. ’Tis reasonable
6473,_ACHILLES._,"This, and no dream. ’Tis my experience."
6474,_ACHILLES._,"When I am with thee, Pyrrha, I want nothing."
6475,_ACHILLES._,No woman sitting by her silly lover
6476,_ACHILLES._,Could take such pleasure from his flatteries
6477,_ACHILLES._,As I from thy speech. When thou lookest on me
6478,_ACHILLES._,"I am all joy; and if ’tis so with thee,"
6479,_ACHILLES._,"Why need we argue? Tell me, when I am with thee"
6480,_ACHILLES._,"Dost thou lack aught, or wish I were a man?                      341"
6481,_ACHILLES._,
6482,_ACHILLES._,"_Ach._ In truth nay, but..."
6483,_ACHILLES._,
6484,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._                    A wretched but: I know
6485,_ACHILLES._,What that would say; this thing cannot be done
6486,_ACHILLES._,Because ’twas never done. But that’s with me
6487,_ACHILLES._,The reason why it should be done.
6488,_ACHILLES._,
6489,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._                          I see.
6490,_ACHILLES._,Yet novelty hath no wear. Remember too
6491,_ACHILLES._,We must grow old. The spirit of such adventure
6492,_ACHILLES._,Tires as the body ages.
6493,_ACHILLES._,
6494,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._               For that I think
6495,_ACHILLES._,"I make the best provision. Nay, I have seen"
6496,_ACHILLES._,"Full many an old dame left in last neglect,                      350"
6497,_ACHILLES._,"Whose keen gray eye, peaked face, and silver hair"
6498,_ACHILLES._,Were god-like set beneath a helm of brass.
6499,_ACHILLES._,
6500,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._ Here be the maids: ask them their mind at once.
6501,_ACHILLES._,
6502,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._ Nay, for the world no word."
6503,_ACHILLES._,
6504,_ACHILLES._,"_Enter Chorus, with flowers._"
6505,_ACHILLES._,
6506,_ACHILLES._,Why run they breathlessly in merry fear?
6507,_ACHILLES._,What have ye seen? What now?
6508,_ACHILLES._,
6509,_ACHILLES._,"_Ch._                      The king. Fly, fly!"
6510,_ACHILLES._,
6511,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._ Why should we fly the king?
6512,_ACHILLES._,
6513,_ACHILLES._,"_Ch._ A man is with him, and they come this way."
6514,_ACHILLES._,
6515,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._ Who is it?
6516,_ACHILLES._,
6517,_ACHILLES._,"_Ch._            Nay, we know not."
6518,_ACHILLES._,
6519,_ACHILLES._,_Deid._                          What hath happed?
6520,_ACHILLES._,
6521,_ACHILLES._,"_Ch._ We went forth as ye bade, and all together"
6522,_ACHILLES._,"Ran down the hill, the straightest way we might,"
6523,_ACHILLES._,"Into the copse, and lo! ’twas as thou saidst;                    362"
6524,_ACHILLES._,"The hazels are all felled, but on the ground,"
6525,_ACHILLES._,That ’neath the straight trunks of the airy trees
6526,_ACHILLES._,"Lies in the spotted sunlight, are upsprung"
6527,_ACHILLES._,"Countless anemones, white, red, and blue,"
6528,_ACHILLES._,"In the bright glade. Forgetting why we came,"
6529,_ACHILLES._,"We fell to gathering these. I chose the blue,"
6530,_ACHILLES._,"As ye may see, loving blue blossoms best,"
6531,_ACHILLES._,That are content with heaven.
6532,_ACHILLES._,
6533,_ACHILLES._,"_2nd Speaker._              And I the red,                     370"
6534,_ACHILLES._,Love’s passionate colour; and the love in these
6535,_ACHILLES._,Is mixed with heavenly to a royal purple.
6536,_ACHILLES._,
6537,_ACHILLES._,"_3rd._ And I the white: whose praise I will not tell,"
6538,_ACHILLES._,Lest it should blush.
6539,_ACHILLES._,
6540,_ACHILLES._,_4th._              And I have mixed together
6541,_ACHILLES._,The red and white.
6542,_ACHILLES._,
6543,_ACHILLES._,_5th._           And I the red and blue.
6544,_ACHILLES._,
6545,_ACHILLES._,_6th._ And I the blue and white.
6546,_ACHILLES._,
6547,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._                        Well, but the matter."
6548,_ACHILLES._,"What happened next, tell me?"
6549,_ACHILLES._,
6550,_ACHILLES._,"_Ch._ (_1st._)             Still at this game,"
6551,_ACHILLES._,"Like to a hungry herd that stops and feeds,"
6552,_ACHILLES._,"Snatching what tempts it on, we made advance"
6553,_ACHILLES._,"To the entrance of the combe; and then one cried,"
6554,_ACHILLES._,"Look up! Look there! And from the open brow,"
6555,_ACHILLES._,"Whence we looked down upon the sea, we saw                       382"
6556,_ACHILLES._,"A great war-ship in the harbour: and one said,"
6557,_ACHILLES._,"She comes from Athens; and another, nay,"
6558,_ACHILLES._,"Her build is Rhodian: when as there we gazed,"
6559,_ACHILLES._,"Counting her ports, and wondering of her name,—"
6560,_ACHILLES._,We heard men’s voices and beheld the king
6561,_ACHILLES._,"Mounting the hill-side, with a stranger clad"
6562,_ACHILLES._,"In short Greek robes. Then ran we back to thee,"
6563,_ACHILLES._,"Ere we were seen, in haste; that we may hide,                    390"
6564,_ACHILLES._,And not be called within to attend the guests.
6565,_ACHILLES._,
6566,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._ So did ye well, whoe’er it be, and best"
6567,_ACHILLES._,"If ’tis the prince of Melos, as I fear:"
6568,_ACHILLES._,Who late my father said would come to woo me:
6569,_ACHILLES._,But he must find me first.      [_Going._
6570,_ACHILLES._,
6571,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._                   I’ll be thine eyes
6572,_ACHILLES._,"And take his measure. Let me lurk behind,"
6573,_ACHILLES._,"I’ll learn his height, the colour of his beard,"
6574,_ACHILLES._,And bring thee word.
6575,_ACHILLES._,
6576,_ACHILLES._,"_Deid._            I pray, no beards for me."
6577,_ACHILLES._,Those that love beards remain. The rest with me.
6578,_ACHILLES._,"Follow me, follow: I lead the race.      [_Exit._"
6579,_ACHILLES._,
6580,_ACHILLES._,"_Ch._ Follow, we follow. We give thee chase—"
6581,_ACHILLES._,"Follow me, follow—                                         402"
6582,_ACHILLES._,"—We come, we come.      [_Exeunt Chor._"
6583,_ACHILLES._,
6584,_ACHILLES._,_Ach._ I wish I had had Apollo for my sire;
6585,_ACHILLES._,"Or that old Cheiron, when he taught me arms,"
6586,_ACHILLES._,"Hunting the beasts on bushy Pelion,"
6587,_ACHILLES._,"Had led and trained me rather, as well he knew,"
6588,_ACHILLES._,"In that fair park of fancy and delight,"
6589,_ACHILLES._,Where but the Graces and the Muses come.
6590,_ACHILLES._,For he could sing: and oft took down at eve                      410
6591,_ACHILLES._,From the high pillar of his rocky cave
6592,_ACHILLES._,"The lyre or pipe, and whiled the darksome hours."
6593,_ACHILLES._,"Which would I had learned, to touch the stops and strings,"
6594,_ACHILLES._,"Nor only harked thereto: for nought he sang,"
6595,_ACHILLES._,"Whether of gods or men, of peace or war,"
6596,_ACHILLES._,Had any theme of sweetness to compare
6597,_ACHILLES._,"With my new world, here, where I am king, and rule"
6598,_ACHILLES._,The sweetest thing in nature. Had I skill
6599,_ACHILLES._,"To give translation to my joy, I think"
6600,_ACHILLES._,I could make music that should charm the world.
6601,_ACHILLES._,"O Deidamia, thou Queen of my heart,                              421"
6602,_ACHILLES._,I would enchant thee and thine isle. Alas!
6603,_ACHILLES._,How wilt thou learn thou art mine? How can I tell
6604,_ACHILLES._,And with the word not lose thee? Now this suitor
6605,_ACHILLES._,Threats my betrayal... He comes. I’ll watch. Yet not
6606,_ACHILLES._,"With jealous eyes, but heedful of my fate."
6607,_ACHILLES._,
6608,_ACHILLES._,[_Hides in bushes._
6609,_ACHILLES._,
6610,_ACHILLES._,_Enter Lycomedes and Abas._
6611,_ACHILLES._,
6612,_LYCOMEDES._,_LYCOMEDES._
6613,_LYCOMEDES._,
6614,_LYCOMEDES._,’Tis folly and impertinence. I say it
6615,_LYCOMEDES._,"With due respect unto the prince, thy master,"
6616,_LYCOMEDES._,Who am as much his elder as the king
6617,_LYCOMEDES._,"His father is. He ne’er would so have wronged me,—"
6618,_LYCOMEDES._,The mild and good Laertes.—In this isle                          431
6619,_LYCOMEDES._,"Think’st thou ’twere possible a man should hide,"
6620,_LYCOMEDES._,And I not know it?
6621,_LYCOMEDES._,
6622,_ABAS._,_ABAS._
6623,_ABAS._,
6624,_ABAS._,"My Lord Ulysses, sire,"
6625,_ABAS._,Bade me assure your majesty he came
6626,_ABAS._,"More with the purpose to acquit your honour,—"
6627,_ABAS._,"Which suffers greatly in the common tongue,—"
6628,_ABAS._,Than with a hope to find what he pretends
6629,_ABAS._,He comes to seek.
6630,_ABAS._,
6631,_ABAS._,_Lyc._          Why should he come at all?
6632,_ABAS._,
6633,_ABAS._,_Ab._ Taking your invitation in the sense
6634,_ABAS._,That I have spoken...
6635,_ABAS._,
6636,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._               Thinks he, if I chose                     440"
6637,_ABAS._,"To hide the man in Scyros, that a stranger"
6638,_ABAS._,From Ithaca could find him?
6639,_ABAS._,
6640,_ABAS._,_Ab._              Nay...
6641,_ABAS._,
6642,_ABAS._,_Lyc._                  It follows
6643,_ABAS._,"Your search can never quit my honesty,"
6644,_ABAS._,Where I am held accomplice; but no less
6645,_ABAS._,"Must put a slight upon my wits, implying"
6646,_ABAS._,Me the deceived.
6647,_ABAS._,
6648,_ABAS._,"_Ab._          Your invitation, sire,"
6649,_ABAS._,Covers that charge.
6650,_ABAS._,
6651,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._            My invitation, sir,"
6652,_ABAS._,"Was but my seal of full denial, a challenge"
6653,_ABAS._,"For honour’s eye, not to be taken up."
6654,_ABAS._,Your master hath slipped in manners: yet fear not
6655,_ABAS._,But I will meet and treat him as his birth                       451
6656,_ABAS._,And name require. Speak we no more of this.
6657,_ABAS._,What think’st thou of our isle?
6658,_ABAS._,
6659,_ABAS._,_Ab._                         The famed Ægean
6660,_ABAS._,Hath not a finer jewel on her breast.
6661,_ABAS._,
6662,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._ Come, come! you overpraise us: there’s no need."
6663,_ABAS._,We Scyrians are contented.—Now we are climbed
6664,_ABAS._,Above the town to the east; and you may see
6665,_ABAS._,"The western seaboard, and our other port."
6666,_ABAS._,"The island narrows here to twenty stades,"
6667,_ABAS._,Cut like a wasp; the shoulder where we stand                     460
6668,_ABAS._,"Is its best natured spot: It falls to the sun,"
6669,_ABAS._,And at this time of the year takes not too much.
6670,_ABAS._,
6671,_ABAS._,_Ab._ ’Tis strange how in all points the lie of the land
6672,_ABAS._,"Is like our Ithaca, but better clothed."
6673,_ABAS._,
6674,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._ And larger, is’t not?"
6675,_ABAS._,
6676,_ABAS._,_Ab._                      Past comparison.—
6677,_ABAS._,
6678,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ What navy bring ye to the war?
6679,_ABAS._,
6680,_ABAS._,"_Ab._                               Ah, sire!"
6681,_ABAS._,We have no ships to boast of—with our own
6682,_ABAS._,"Zakynthus, Cephallenia, and the rest,"
6683,_ABAS._,"Joining their numbers, raise but ten or twelve."
6684,_ABAS._,
6685,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ And these your prince commands?                         470
6686,_ABAS._,
6687,_ABAS._,_Ab._                                Such as they be.
6688,_ABAS._,
6689,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ Tidings come slowly to us here. I pray you
6690,_ABAS._,Tell me the latest of your preparations.
6691,_ABAS._,The thing must drag: there was some talk awhile
6692,_ABAS._,Of coldness ’twixt the chiefs: ’twould be no wonder.
6693,_ABAS._,They that combine upon one private grudge
6694,_ABAS._,May split upon another.
6695,_ABAS._,
6696,_ABAS._,_Ab._                 Still their zeal
6697,_ABAS._,Increases: ’tis as fire spread from a spark.
6698,_ABAS._,
6699,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ A spark? well—Menelaus. At this time
6700,_ABAS._,"What numbers hath he drawn, and whence?"
6701,_ABAS._,
6702,_ABAS._,_Ab._                          The ships
6703,_ABAS._,Number above a thousand: a tenth of these                        480
6704,_ABAS._,"Are sent by Corinth, Sicyon and Mycenæ;"
6705,_ABAS._,"Sixty are Spartan, and king Agamemnon"
6706,_ABAS._,Provides as many as these all told together.
6707,_ABAS._,"Then from Ægina, Epidaurus, Argos,"
6708,_ABAS._,And Tiryns Diomede brings eighty: Nestor
6709,_ABAS._,Ninety from Pylos; from Bœotia
6710,_ABAS._,Come eighty; Phocis and Phthiotis each
6711,_ABAS._,Send forty; Athens fifty; and Eubœa
6712,_ABAS._,Forty; from Salamis Ajax brings twelve;
6713,_ABAS._,Oilean Ajax with the Locrians                                    490
6714,_ABAS._,"Forty more; from our neighbours in the west,"
6715,_ABAS._,"Dulichium and Ætolia, eighty sail;"
6716,_ABAS._,Again as many from hundred-citied Crete
6717,_ABAS._,"Under the king Idomeneus, and nine"
6718,_ABAS._,"From Rhodes: All these, with others that escape"
6719,_ABAS._,"My hasty summing, lie drawn up at Aulis."
6720,_ABAS._,"’Tis such a sight as, I am bold to say,"
6721,_ABAS._,"If but your majesty could see it, would move you"
6722,_ABAS._,To make a part of the splendour.
6723,_ABAS._,
6724,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._                         Nay, I have seen them."
6725,_ABAS._,
6726,_ABAS._,_Ab._ Your majesty hath been at Aulis?
6727,_ABAS._,
6728,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._                               Nay,                      500"
6729,_ABAS._,Nor yet at Aulis: but the tale thou tellest
6730,_ABAS._,"Coming unto my ears a month ago,"
6731,_ABAS._,Some of my lords and I one idle morn
6732,_ABAS._,"Crossed to Eubœa,—’tis a pleasure trip,"
6733,_ABAS._,On a clear day scarce out of sight of home—
6734,_ABAS._,"We landed ’neath Œchalia by noon,"
6735,_ABAS._,"And, crossing o’er the isle on mules, were lodged"
6736,_ABAS._,That night at Chalcis. The next day at dawn
6737,_ABAS._,I played the spy. ’Twas such a breathless morning
6738,_ABAS._,When all the sound and motion of the sea                         510
6739,_ABAS._,"Is short and sullen, like a dreaming beast:"
6740,_ABAS._,Or as ’twere mixed of heavier elements
6741,_ABAS._,"Than the bright water, that obeys the wind."
6742,_ABAS._,Hiring a fishing-boat we bade the sailors
6743,_ABAS._,"Row us to Aulis; when midway the straits,"
6744,_ABAS._,"The morning mist lifted, and lo, a sight"
6745,_ABAS._,Unpicturable.—High upon our left
6746,_ABAS._,"Where we supposed was nothing, suddenly"
6747,_ABAS._,"A tall and shadowy figure loomed: then two,"
6748,_ABAS._,"And three, and four, and more towering above us:"
6749,_ABAS._,But whether poised upon the leaden sea                           521
6750,_ABAS._,"They stood, or floated in the misty air,"
6751,_ABAS._,That baffling our best vision held entangled
6752,_ABAS._,"The silver of the half-awakened sun,"
6753,_ABAS._,"Or whether near or far, we could not tell,"
6754,_ABAS._,"Nor what: at first I thought them rocks, but ere"
6755,_ABAS._,"That error could be told, they were upon us"
6756,_ABAS._,Bearing down swiftly athwart our course; and all
6757,_ABAS._,"Saw ’twas a fleet of ships, not three or four"
6758,_ABAS._,"Now, but unnumber’d: like a floating city,                       530"
6759,_ABAS._,"If such could be, with walls and battlements"
6760,_ABAS._,Spread on the wondering water: and now the sun
6761,_ABAS._,"Broke thro’ the haze, and from the shields outhung"
6762,_ABAS._,"Blazed back his dazzling beams, and round their prows"
6763,_ABAS._,On the divided water played; as still
6764,_ABAS._,"They rode the tide in silence, all their oars"
6765,_ABAS._,"Stretched out aloft, as are the balanced wings"
6766,_ABAS._,"Of storm-fowl, which returned from battling flight"
6767,_ABAS._,"Across the sea, steady their aching plumes"
6768,_ABAS._,And skim along the shuddering cliffs at ease:                    540
6769,_ABAS._,"So came they gliding on the sullen plain,"
6770,_ABAS._,"Out of the dark, in silent state, by force"
6771,_ABAS._,Yet unexpended of their nightlong speed.
6772,_ABAS._,"Those were the Cretan ships, who when they saw us"
6773,_ABAS._,"Hailed for a pilot, and of our native sailors"
6774,_ABAS._,"Took one aboard, and dipping all their oars"
6775,_ABAS._,"Passed on, and we with them, into the bay."
6776,_ABAS._,"Then from all round, where the dark hulls were moored"
6777,_ABAS._,"Against the shore, and from the tents above"
6778,_ABAS._,"A shout of joy went up, re-echoing                               550"
6779,_ABAS._,From point to point; and we too cheered and caught
6780,_ABAS._,The zeal of that great gathering.—Where man is met
6781,_ABAS._,The gods will come; or shall I say man’s spirit
6782,_ABAS._,Hath operative faculties to mix
6783,_ABAS._,"And make his gods at will? Howe’er that be,"
6784,_ABAS._,Soon a swift galley shot out from the rest
6785,_ABAS._,"To meet the comers. That was Agamemnon’s,"
6786,_ABAS._,"They told me; and I doubt not he was in it,"
6787,_ABAS._,"And gave his welcome to Idomeneus,"
6788,_ABAS._,And took him to his tent. On such a day                          560
6789,_ABAS._,Our little boat rowed where we would unmarked:
6790,_ABAS._,We were but Chalcian pilots. So I saw
6791,_ABAS._,"Whate’er I wished to see, and came away"
6792,_ABAS._,"Across the strait that night, and the next day"
6793,_ABAS._,Was home by sundown.
6794,_ABAS._,
6795,_ABAS._,_Ab._              All this could you see
6796,_ABAS._,Without the wish to join?
6797,_ABAS._,
6798,_ABAS._,_Lyc._                  I say not that;
6799,_ABAS._,For wish I did that I was young again.
6800,_ABAS._,"Then, sir, I would have left whate’er I had,"
6801,_ABAS._,"My kingdom to another, for the pride,"
6802,_ABAS._,Of high place in such war; now I am old.                         570
6803,_ABAS._,
6804,_ABAS._,"_Ab._ But older men than thou have joined us, sire."
6805,_ABAS._,War needs experience.
6806,_ABAS._,
6807,_ABAS._,_Lyc._              Concerning war
6808,_ABAS._,"I am divided in opinion, Abas:"
6809,_ABAS._,But lean to think it hath a wholesome root
6810,_ABAS._,Supportive to our earthly habit. I see
6811,_ABAS._,"The noblest beasts will love to fight, and man"
6812,_ABAS._,Is body as well as spirit: his mind that’s set
6813,_ABAS._,In judgment o’er those twain must oft admit
6814,_ABAS._,The grosser part hath a preponderant claim.
6815,_ABAS._,"But I regret this, and my discontent                             580"
6816,_ABAS._,"Puts me this question, Shall man never come"
6817,_ABAS._,To a better state with his desire? What think you?
6818,_ABAS._,What if our race yet young should with the time
6819,_ABAS._,"Throw off the baser passions, as I find"
6820,_ABAS._,Myself by age affected? I know not...
6821,_ABAS._,"I have a little statue in my house,"
6822,_ABAS._,"Which, if you look on’t long, begets belief"
6823,_ABAS._,Of absolute perfectionment; the artist
6824,_ABAS._,Should have been present when man’s clay was mixed.
6825,_ABAS._,"Prometheus, or whoever ’twas that made us,                       590"
6826,_ABAS._,Had his head turned with natural history:
6827,_ABAS._,"All excellent contrivance, but betraying"
6828,_ABAS._,Commonness and complexity. Well! well!
6829,_ABAS._,No need of my philosophies in Scyros—
6830,_ABAS._,"War must have motive, and the men I rule"
6831,_ABAS._,Are simple and contented with their lot.
6832,_ABAS._,None in my land would wish an atom changed:
6833,_ABAS._,Were even Achilles here ’twould be no wonder
6834,_ABAS._,If he had caught our temper.
6835,_ABAS._,
6836,_ABAS._,_Ab._                      All men witness
6837,_ABAS._,"To thy good rule, O king: but in the wars                        600"
6838,_ABAS._,Fame may be won.
6839,_ABAS._,
6840,_ABAS._,_Lyc._         Nor do I ask for fame.
6841,_ABAS._,"Come that to whom it will; to Agamemnon,"
6842,_ABAS._,To Ajax or Ulysses or Achilles.
6843,_ABAS._,
6844,_ABAS._,_Ab._ To Achilles no: ’tis not in the gods’ grace
6845,_ABAS._,"To succour pigritude. To him, a lad,"
6846,_ABAS._,The prize of honour above all the Greeks
6847,_ABAS._,Was offered: by the poor effeminacy
6848,_ABAS._,"With which he hath rejected it, he is judged"
6849,_ABAS._,Meanest of all. But since we cannot win
6850,_ABAS._,"Without him, we must have him. Little glory                      610"
6851,_ABAS._,"To him, except to be Fate’s dullest tool."
6852,_ABAS._,
6853,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ Maybe. Now come we on. I had thought to find
6854,_ABAS._,My daughter and her train. I’ll take thee round
6855,_ABAS._,Another way to the palace: thither no doubt
6856,_ABAS._,She is now returned.      [_Exeunt._
6857,_ABAS._,
6858,_ABAS._,_Enter Achilles from the bushes._
6859,_ABAS._,
6860,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Villain, I thank the gods that sent thee hither."
6861,_ABAS._,"But thou wast near thy death. Walk off secure,"
6862,_ABAS._,Not knowing that I heard. _Effeminate!
6863,_ABAS._,"The meanest of the Greeks!_ were he the best,"
6864,_ABAS._,I’d slay him in this garment. Yet he is but                      620
6865,_ABAS._,"A tongue to troll opinion of me, a slave,"
6866,_ABAS._,"Fetcher and carrier of others’ tales, and doth"
6867,_ABAS._,The drudgery honestly; for that I’ll thank him
6868,_ABAS._,"And profit by his slander. Ay, so I’ll do—"
6869,_ABAS._,Now in good time—I’ll get me a man’s dress
6870,_ABAS._,"And meet them here, ere they suspect me:—or, stay!"
6871,_ABAS._,"I can outwit them better. I’ll take a boat,"
6872,_ABAS._,"Cross o’er to Aulis, like good Lycomede,"
6873,_ABAS._,"This very night, and there to Agamemnon"
6874,_ABAS._,Declare myself; and men shall never know                         630
6875,_ABAS._,"How I was hid, nor whence I came."
6876,_ABAS._,
6877,_ABAS._,_Enter Thetis._
6878,_ABAS._,
6879,_ABAS._,_Th._                           My son!
6880,_ABAS._,
6881,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ My goddess mother, welcome! yet I am shamed"
6882,_ABAS._,That thou shouldst find me thus.
6883,_ABAS._,
6884,_ABAS._,_Th._                          How art thou shamed?
6885,_ABAS._,
6886,_ABAS._,_Ach._ This dress. O thou canst help me: thou art ready
6887,_ABAS._,At every need. And here hath been a man
6888,_ABAS._,"Who, thinking not I heard, spake to the king"
6889,_ABAS._,"Of thy Achilles with such scorn, that I"
6890,_ABAS._,"Should have leaped forth upon him in my rage,"
6891,_ABAS._,"And strangled him, but that he seemed to be"
6892,_ABAS._,Another’s servant.                                               640
6893,_ABAS._,
6894,_ABAS._,"_Th._            Then thou hast seen them, son?"
6895,_ABAS._,
6896,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Who are they?
6897,_ABAS._,
6898,_ABAS._,_Th._              Those I came to warn thee of;
6899,_ABAS._,Ulysses and his friends. Knowst thou ’tis they
6900,_ABAS._,Are come unto the isle to seek thee?
6901,_ABAS._,
6902,_ABAS._,_Ach._                             Ay.
6903,_ABAS._,But thou art ready to outwit their wile.
6904,_ABAS._,As thou didst bring me hither on that night
6905,_ABAS._,"When all thy nymphs, assembling ’neath the moon"
6906,_ABAS._,"Upon the Achæan shore, bore me away"
6907,_ABAS._,"Across the sea, even so to Aulis now"
6908,_ABAS._,"Convey me secretly, and set me there,"
6909,_ABAS._,Ere men know whence I come.
6910,_ABAS._,
6911,_ABAS._,"_Th._                     What hear I, son?                    650"
6912,_ABAS._,To Aulis? to thy foes?
6913,_ABAS._,
6914,_ABAS._,_Ach._               A thousand ships
6915,_ABAS._,Moored idle in the bay wait but for me:
6916,_ABAS._,And round the shore the captains of the Greeks
6917,_ABAS._,Impatient in their tents but call for me.
6918,_ABAS._,"Be they my foes to speak or wish me ill,"
6919,_ABAS._,’Tis only that I come not. I must go.
6920,_ABAS._,
6921,_ABAS._,_Th._ There let them tarry till the sea-worm bore
6922,_ABAS._,"Their ships to rottenness; or, sail they forth,"
6923,_ABAS._,"Let them be butchered by the sword of Hector,"
6924,_ABAS._,Ere thou be snared to serve their empty pride.                   660
6925,_ABAS._,
6926,_ABAS._,_Ach._ But louder than their need my honour calls:
6927,_ABAS._,Hast thou no thought of this in all thy love?
6928,_ABAS._,
6929,_ABAS._,_Th._ Who then is honoured more or more desired
6930,_ABAS._,"Than thou art now? but they, if once they had thee,"
6931,_ABAS._,"Would slight thee, and pretend they were the men."
6932,_ABAS._,
6933,_ABAS._,_Ach._ But those are honoured best that hear their praise.
6934,_ABAS._,
6935,_ABAS._,"_Th._ Is not high Zeus himself, holding aloof,"
6936,_ABAS._,"Worshipped the more? Let the world say of thee,"
6937,_ABAS._,"When these have perished, that they went their way"
6938,_ABAS._,Because the son of Thetis would not aid them.                    670
6939,_ABAS._,
6940,_ABAS._,_Ach._ But if ’twere said because he feared to die?
6941,_ABAS._,
6942,_ABAS._,_Th._ Fearst thou reproach of fear that fearst not death?
6943,_ABAS._,
6944,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ I fear not, but by proof would shun reproach."
6945,_ABAS._,
6946,_ABAS._,"_Th._ Men, son, are what they are; and thou art brave."
6947,_ABAS._,’Tis asked of poor and questionable spirits
6948,_ABAS._,To prove their worth.
6949,_ABAS._,
6950,_ABAS._,_Ach._              I prove myself a coward.
6951,_ABAS._,
6952,_ABAS._,"_Th._ How! when it needed heavenly prayers and tears,"
6953,_ABAS._,The force of duty and a goddess’ will
6954,_ABAS._,To keep thee back from death! when all the joys
6955,_ABAS._,"That I have set about thee, and a love                           680"
6956,_ABAS._,More beautiful than Helen’s cannot hold thee!
6957,_ABAS._,
6958,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Fate, that from men hideth her pitiless face,"
6959,_ABAS._,"Offered to me this kindness, that my will"
6960,_ABAS._,Should be of force in predetermined deeds:
6961,_ABAS._,Allowing me to take which life I would
6962,_ABAS._,Of two incomparable lots; I ever
6963,_ABAS._,"Leaned one way, the other thou; and still at heart"
6964,_ABAS._,I hold to my first choice.
6965,_ABAS._,
6966,_ABAS._,"_Th._                    O child of man,"
6967,_ABAS._,"Though child of mine, wouldst thou know wisdom’s way,"
6968,_ABAS._,Learn it of me. If I had said to thee                            690
6969,_ABAS._,Thou being a mortal shouldst love death and darkness;
6970,_ABAS._,For in the brief date of thy heedless term
6971,_ABAS._,’Tis vain to strive with evil: and since the end
6972,_ABAS._,"Cometh the same, and at the latest cometh"
6973,_ABAS._,"So soon, that there’s no difference to be told"
6974,_ABAS._,"’Twixt early and late, ’tis wisdom to despair:"
6975,_ABAS._,"Then would thy tongue have boldly answered me,"
6976,_ABAS._,"And said, Man hath his life; that it must end"
6977,_ABAS._,Condemns it not for nought. Are rivers salt
6978,_ABAS._,Because they travel to the bitter sea?                           700
6979,_ABAS._,Is the day dark because the gorgeous west
6980,_ABAS._,"Must fade in gloom, when the ungazeable sun"
6981,_ABAS._,Is fallen beneath the waves? Or hath the spring
6982,_ABAS._,"No charm in her pavilions, are her floors"
6983,_ABAS._,"Not starred, for that we see her birth is slow"
6984,_ABAS._,"Of niggard winter, and her blossoms smirched"
6985,_ABAS._,"By summer’s tyranny? Hadst thou said this,"
6986,_ABAS._,"And that Earth’s changeful pride, the life of man,"
6987,_ABAS._,Is exquisite in such a quality
6988,_ABAS._,To make the high gods envious could they guess:
6989,_ABAS._,Then had I found no answer: but when I                           711
6990,_ABAS._,"Told thee of joy, and set thee in the midst,"
6991,_ABAS._,That thou shouldst argue with me that ’tis best
6992,_ABAS._,"To die at once, and for an empty name"
6993,_ABAS._,Pass to the trivial shades; then must I fear
6994,_ABAS._,"I have as thankless and unwise a son,"
6995,_ABAS._,As disobedient.—Yet when first I taught thee
6996,_ABAS._,Thou gav’st me promise to be wise.
6997,_ABAS._,
6998,_ABAS._,_Ach._                           But never
6999,_ABAS._,Wilt thou then free me from my promise given?
7000,_ABAS._,
7001,_ABAS._,_Th._ Not to thy hurt.                                         720
7002,_ABAS._,
7003,_ABAS._,_Ach._               See now what shame I bear!
7004,_ABAS._,
7005,_ABAS._,_Th._ Why make so much of shame? If thou despise
7006,_ABAS._,"The pleasure of the earth, why not the shame?"
7007,_ABAS._,
7008,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ I wrong, too, this old king."
7009,_ABAS._,
7010,_ABAS._,"_Th._                             His daughter more,"
7011,_ABAS._,If thou desert her.
7012,_ABAS._,
7013,_ABAS._,_Ach._            But ’twould hurt her less
7014,_ABAS._,To lose me now than know me when disgraced.
7015,_ABAS._,
7016,_ABAS._,"_Th._ I plead not in her name, nor charge thee, son,"
7017,_ABAS._,With loving her in my contempt. A dream
7018,_ABAS._,Of mortal fancy or honour may becloud
7019,_ABAS._,"Thy mind awhile, but ne’er canst thou forget"
7020,_ABAS._,Thy bond to me; the care that never left thee                    730
7021,_ABAS._,Till thou wert out of hand; the love that dared
7022,_ABAS._,"To send thee from my sight when thou wast able,"
7023,_ABAS._,And to strange lands; my secret visitings
7024,_ABAS._,"There, and revisitings; the dreams I sent thee,"
7025,_ABAS._,"Warnings of ill, and ecstasies of pride;"
7026,_ABAS._,"The thousand miracles I wrought to save thee,"
7027,_ABAS._,And guard thee to thy prime;—and now men say
7028,_ABAS._,Thou art the first of the Greeks: their homaged kings
7029,_ABAS._,The gods condemn to death if thou withhold                       739
7030,_ABAS._,Thy single arm. Why so? What hast thou done?
7031,_ABAS._,Where have men seen thee? Hast thou ruled like Nestor?
7032,_ABAS._,"Conquered like Agamemnon, fought like Ajax?"
7033,_ABAS._,"What is thy prowess, what thy skill but this,"
7034,_ABAS._,"That thou art son of Thetis? Disobey not,"
7035,_ABAS._,"Nor question now my bidding. Must I kneel,"
7036,_ABAS._,"Embrace thy knees, or melt before thy face"
7037,_ABAS._,In supplicating tears? O if thy birth
7038,_ABAS._,"Did cost the tenderest tears that god e’er shed,"
7039,_ABAS._,Make not those bitter drops to have flowed in vain.
7040,_ABAS._,Whate’er fate portion thee my joy is this—                       750
7041,_ABAS._,"That thou dost love me. Dost thou cease to love,"
7042,_ABAS._,I am most miserable.
7043,_ABAS._,
7044,_ABAS._,"_Ach._             O fear not that,"
7045,_ABAS._,"Mother and goddess! Pardon me, weep not."
7046,_ABAS._,"Let all men curse me, be my name abhorred,"
7047,_ABAS._,Rather than thou be grieved. ’Twas anger moved me:
7048,_ABAS._,"I will forget this, and obey thee. Say"
7049,_ABAS._,"What I must do, how best avoid these men:"
7050,_ABAS._,And how refuse their call if I be found.
7051,_ABAS._,
7052,_ABAS._,"_Th._ Kiss me, my son. By the gods’ life, I love thee:"
7053,_ABAS._,My grief is to deny thee. But there’s need                       760
7054,_ABAS._,"Of counsel, for the day is critical"
7055,_ABAS._,"And glides apace. And first if they should find thee,"
7056,_ABAS._,Then ’tis thy fate to go: I cannot stay thee.
7057,_ABAS._,"And since to bear thee hence were sure betrayal,"
7058,_ABAS._,I urge thee to be true to thy disguise.
7059,_ABAS._,"And better to escape thy foes, learn now"
7060,_ABAS._,Whom most to dread. Of all the Argives shun
7061,_ABAS._,Ulysses; come not near him in the halls;
7062,_ABAS._,"And should he speak to thee, answer no word."
7063,_ABAS._,Him thou wilt know by his preëminence:                           770
7064,_ABAS._,"In person he is beardless yet, and smooth"
7065,_ABAS._,"Of face and tongue, alluring, gentle in voice"
7066,_ABAS._,"But sturdy of body, and ’neath his helm his locks"
7067,_ABAS._,O’er a wide brow and restless eye curl forth
7068,_ABAS._,In ruddy brown; nor less for his attire
7069,_ABAS._,"Notable is he, wearing the best of all,"
7070,_ABAS._,"His linen broidered, and broad jewels to hold"
7071,_ABAS._,A robe of gray and purple.
7072,_ABAS._,
7073,_ABAS._,_Ach._                   He shall not spy me.
7074,_ABAS._,But if by any warning from the gods
7075,_ABAS._,"He know and call to me, how then to escape                       780"
7076,_ABAS._,The shame of this Ionian skirt?
7077,_ABAS._,
7078,_ABAS._,_Th._                           That chance
7079,_ABAS._,"I can provide for, and shall give thee now"
7080,_ABAS._,"A magic garment fitting to thy body,"
7081,_ABAS._,Which worn beneath thy robe will seem as weft
7082,_ABAS._,"Of linen thread, but if it meet the light"
7083,_ABAS._,"’Twill be a gilded armour, and serve well"
7084,_ABAS._,"In proof as show. Come, I will set it on thee."
7085,_ABAS._,
7086,_ABAS._,[_Exeunt._
7087,_ABAS._,
7088,_ABAS._,_Enter Deidamia and Chorus._
7089,_ABAS._,
7090,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ The ground is clear, we have deceived them mightily,"
7091,_ABAS._,Running around.
7092,_ABAS._,
7093,_ABAS._,_Ch._         Where is our queen?
7094,_ABAS._,
7095,_ABAS._,(_2_)                             Not here.
7096,_ABAS._,
7097,_ABAS._,_Deid._ I’ll call her. Pyrrha!—Call all together.
7098,_ABAS._,
7099,_ABAS._,_Ch._                                           Pyrrha!
7100,_ABAS._,
7101,_ABAS._,_Deid._ She will come presently.—Did ye not mark
7102,_ABAS._,How resonant this glade is? that our voices                      792
7103,_ABAS._,"Neither return nor fly, but stay about us?"
7104,_ABAS._,It is the trunks of the trees that cage the sound;
7105,_ABAS._,"As in an open temple, where the pillars"
7106,_ABAS._,Enrich the music. In my father’s hall
7107,_ABAS._,The echo of each note burdens the next.
7108,_ABAS._,’Twould be well done to cut a theatre
7109,_ABAS._,"Deep in some wooded dale. Till Pyrrha come,"
7110,_ABAS._,"Alexia, sing thou here."
7111,_ABAS._,
7112,_ABAS._,_Ch._                 What shall I sing?                       800
7113,_ABAS._,
7114,_ABAS._,_Deid._ There is a Lydian chant I call to mind
7115,_ABAS._,In honour of music-makers: it beginneth
7116,_ABAS._,"With praise of the soft spring, and heavenly love—"
7117,_ABAS._,"’Twill suit our mood, if thou remember it."
7118,_ABAS._,
7119,_ABAS._,_Chorus._
7120,_ABAS._,
7121,_ABAS._,"The earth loveth the spring,"
7122,_ABAS._,"Nor of her coming despaireth,"
7123,_ABAS._,"Withheld by nightly sting,"
7124,_ABAS._,"Snow, and icy fling,"
7125,_ABAS._,The snarl of the North:
7126,_ABAS._,But nevertheless she prepareth                               810
7127,_ABAS._,"And setteth in order her nurselings to bring them forth,"
7128,_ABAS._,"The jewels of her delight,"
7129,_ABAS._,"What shall be blue, what yellow or white;"
7130,_ABAS._,"What softest above the rest,"
7131,_ABAS._,"The primrose, that loveth best"
7132,_ABAS._,Woodland skirts and the copses shorn.
7133,_ABAS._,
7134,_ABAS._,
7135,_ABAS._,2.
7136,_ABAS._,
7137,_ABAS._,And on the day of relenting she suddenly weareth
7138,_ABAS._,"Her budding crowns. O then, in the early morn,"
7139,_ABAS._,Is any song that compareth
7140,_ABAS._,"With the gaiety of birds, that thrill the gladdened air"
7141,_ABAS._,In inexhaustible chorus                                      821
7142,_ABAS._,To awake the sons of the soil
7143,_ABAS._,With music more than in brilliant halls sonorous
7144,_ABAS._,(—It cannot compare—)
7145,_ABAS._,Is fed to the ears of kings
7146,_ABAS._,From the reeds and hirèd strings?
7147,_ABAS._,For love maketh them glad;
7148,_ABAS._,"And if a soul be sad,"
7149,_ABAS._,"Or a heart oracle dumb,"
7150,_ABAS._,Here may it taste the promise of joy to come.                    830
7151,_ABAS._,
7152,_ABAS._,
7153,_ABAS._,3.
7154,_ABAS._,
7155,_ABAS._,"For the Earth knoweth the love which made her,"
7156,_ABAS._,"The omnipotent one desire,"
7157,_ABAS._,"Which burns at her heart like fire,"
7158,_ABAS._,And hath in gladness arrayed her.
7159,_ABAS._,"And man with the Maker shareth,"
7160,_ABAS._,"Him also to rival throughout the lands,"
7161,_ABAS._,To make a work with his hands
7162,_ABAS._,And have his children adore it:
7163,_ABAS._,The Creator smileth on him who is wise and dareth
7164,_ABAS._,In understanding with pride:                                 840
7165,_ABAS._,"For God, where’er he hath builded, dwelleth wide,—"
7166,_ABAS._,"And he careth,—"
7167,_ABAS._,"To set a task to the smallest atom,"
7168,_ABAS._,"The law-abiding grains,"
7169,_ABAS._,That hearken each and rejoice:
7170,_ABAS._,For he guideth the world as a horse with reins;
7171,_ABAS._,"It obeyeth his voice,"
7172,_ABAS._,And lo! he hath set a beautiful end before it:
7173,_ABAS._,
7174,_ABAS._,
7175,_ABAS._,4.
7176,_ABAS._,
7177,_ABAS._,"Whereto it leapeth and striveth continually,"
7178,_ABAS._,"And pitieth nought, nor spareth:                             850"
7179,_ABAS._,"The mother’s wail for her children slain,"
7180,_ABAS._,"The stain of disease,"
7181,_ABAS._,"The darts of pain,"
7182,_ABAS._,"The waste of the fruits of trees,"
7183,_ABAS._,"The slaughter of cattle,"
7184,_ABAS._,"Unbrotherly lust, the war"
7185,_ABAS._,"Of hunger, blood, and the yells of battle,"
7186,_ABAS._,It heedeth no more
7187,_ABAS._,Than a carver regardeth the wood that he cutteth away:
7188,_ABAS._,"The grainèd shavings fall at his feet,                       860"
7189,_ABAS._,But that which his tool hath spared shall stand
7190,_ABAS._,For men to praise the work of his hand;
7191,_ABAS._,"For he cutteth so far, and there it lay,"
7192,_ABAS._,And his work is complete.
7193,_ABAS._,
7194,_ABAS._,
7195,_ABAS._,5.
7196,_ABAS._,
7197,_ABAS._,But I will praise ’mong men the masters of mind
7198,_ABAS._,"In music and song,"
7199,_ABAS._,Who follow the love of God to bless their kind:
7200,_ABAS._,And I pray they find
7201,_ABAS._,A marriage of mirth—
7202,_ABAS._,And a life long                                              870
7203,_ABAS._,With the gaiety of the Earth.
7204,_ABAS._,
7205,_ABAS._,"_Ch._ There stands an old man down beneath the bank,"
7206,_ABAS._,"Gazing, and beckoning to us."
7207,_ABAS._,
7208,_ABAS._,"_Deid._                    He is a stranger,"
7209,_ABAS._,That burdened with some package to the palace
7210,_ABAS._,"Hath missed his way about, and fears to intrude."
7211,_ABAS._,Go some and show him.      [_Some run out._
7212,_ABAS._,Meanwhile what do we?
7213,_ABAS._,We have no sport when Pyrrha is away.
7214,_ABAS._,"Our game is broken. Come, a thought, a thought!"
7215,_ABAS._,Hath none a thought?
7216,_ABAS._,
7217,_ABAS._,_Ch._              We have never built the bower.
7218,_ABAS._,
7219,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Ye idled gathering flowers. Now ’tis too late.
7220,_ABAS._,
7221,_ABAS._,_Ch._ Let us play ball.
7222,_ABAS._,
7223,_ABAS._,_Deid._               The sun is still so high.                881
7224,_ABAS._,I shall go feed my doves.
7225,_ABAS._,
7226,_ABAS._,(_Re-enter one of Chorus._)
7227,_ABAS._,
7228,_ABAS._,_Ch._              The old man saith
7229,_ABAS._,"That he is a pedlar, and hath wares to sell"
7230,_ABAS._,If he may show them. Shall he come?
7231,_ABAS._,
7232,_ABAS._,"_Deid._                           Now Hermes,"
7233,_ABAS._,"The father of device and jugglery,"
7234,_ABAS._,Be thanked for this; ’tis he hath sent him.—Call him.
7235,_ABAS._,"His tales may be good hearing, tho’ his pack"
7236,_ABAS._,"Repay not search. But be advised: beware,"
7237,_ABAS._,Lest he bear off more than he bring: these fellows
7238,_ABAS._,Have fingers to unclasp a brooch or pin                          890
7239,_ABAS._,While the eye winks that watches. There was one
7240,_ABAS._,Who as he ran a race would steal the shoes
7241,_ABAS._,Of any that ran with him. The prince of all
7242,_ABAS._,Was merry Autolycus.
7243,_ABAS._,
7244,_ABAS._,"_Enter, with those who had gone out, Ulysses as a pedlar._"
7245,_ABAS._,
7246,_ABAS._,"Good day, old man."

7248,_ABAS._,
7249,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                     I have no breath left,"
7250,_ABAS._,"Wherewith to thank you, ladies; the little hill"
7251,_ABAS._,Has ta’en it from me.
7252,_ABAS._,
7253,_ABAS._,"_Deid._             Rest awhile, and tell us"
7254,_ABAS._,Whence thou art come.
7255,_ABAS._,
7256,_ABAS._,_Ul._               In a Greek ship this morn.
7257,_ABAS._,"I pray you, that I lack not courtesy,"
7258,_ABAS._,Art thou the princess of this isle?
7259,_ABAS._,
7260,_ABAS._,_Deid._                           I am.                        900
7261,_ABAS._,
7262,_ABAS._,_Ul._ My true and humble service to your highness.
7263,_ABAS._,
7264,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ In turn say who art thou, and whence thy ship."
7265,_ABAS._,
7266,_ABAS._,"_Ul._ Fair, honoured daughter of a famous king,"
7267,_ABAS._,"I have no story worthy of thine ear,"
7268,_ABAS._,"Being but a poor artificer of Smyrna,"
7269,_ABAS._,"Where many years I wrought, and ye shall see"
7270,_ABAS._,"Not without skill, in silver and in gold."
7271,_ABAS._,"But happiness hath wrecked me, and I say"
7272,_ABAS._,’Tis ill to marry young; for from that joy
7273,_ABAS._,"I gat a son, who as the time went on,                            910"
7274,_ABAS._,Grew to be old and gray and wise as I;
7275,_ABAS._,And bettering much the art which I had taught him
7276,_ABAS._,"Longed to be master in my place, for which"
7277,_ABAS._,"He grew unkind, and his sons hated me:"
7278,_ABAS._,"And when one day he wished me dead, I feared"
7279,_ABAS._,Lest I should kill myself; and so that night
7280,_ABAS._,I made me up a pack of little things
7281,_ABAS._,"He should not grieve for, and took ship for Greece."
7282,_ABAS._,"There have I trafficked, lady, a year and more,"
7283,_ABAS._,And kept myself alive hawking small ware                         920
7284,_ABAS._,"From place to place, and on occasion found"
7285,_ABAS._,"A market for my jewels, and be come here"
7286,_ABAS._,Making the round of the isles in any ship
7287,_ABAS._,That chances: and this last I came aboard
7288,_ABAS._,"At Andros, where I was: but whence she hailed"
7289,_ABAS._,I have even forgot. May it please thee see my wares?
7290,_ABAS._,
7291,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Thy tale is very sad. I am sorry for thee.
7292,_ABAS._,"Why would thy son, being as thou sayst so skilled,"
7293,_ABAS._,Not ply his trade apart?
7294,_ABAS._,
7295,_ABAS._,_Ul._                  My house in Smyrna
7296,_ABAS._,"Was head of all the goldsmiths: ’twas for that,                  930"
7297,_ABAS._,"Lady, he envied me. See now my wares."
7298,_ABAS._,
7299,_ABAS._,_Deid._ What beauteous work! I’m glad thou’rt come. I’ll buy
7300,_ABAS._,"A trinket for myself, and let my maids"
7301,_ABAS._,"Choose each what she may fancy. Hear ye, girls?"
7302,_ABAS._,I’ll make a gift to each.
7303,_ABAS._,
7304,_ABAS._,_Ch._                   O thanks.—To all?—
7305,_ABAS._,And may we choose?
7306,_ABAS._,
7307,_ABAS._,_Deid._          Yes.
7308,_ABAS._,
7309,_ABAS._,_Ch._               Anything we please?
7310,_ABAS._,
7311,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Why, that is choosing."
7312,_ABAS._,
7313,_ABAS._,_Ch._                        O we thank thee.
7314,_ABAS._,

7316,_ABAS._,"I see, princess, thou’rt of a bounteous blood,"
7317,_ABAS._,To make all round thee happy.
7318,_ABAS._,
7319,_ABAS._,_Deid._                     What is this brooch?
7320,_ABAS._,
7321,_ABAS._,"_Ul._ If for thyself thou fancy a brooch, I’ll show thee"
7322,_ABAS._,"The best jewel in my box, and not be shamed                      941"
7323,_ABAS._,To say I have no better.
7324,_ABAS._,
7325,_ABAS._,"_Ch._                  See, oh, see!"
7326,_ABAS._,What lovely things!—A rare old man!
7327,_ABAS._,
7328,_ABAS._,_Ul._                              Here ’tis.
7329,_ABAS._,What thinkest thou?
7330,_ABAS._,
7331,_ABAS._,_Deid._           Is’t not a ruby?
7332,_ABAS._,
7333,_ABAS._,_Ul._                            And fine!
7334,_ABAS._,
7335,_ABAS._,_Deid._ I think thy son will have missed this.
7336,_ABAS._,
7337,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                                          Nay, lady:"
7338,_ABAS._,"I had it of a sailor, who, poor fool,"
7339,_ABAS._,Knew not its worth; and thou mayst buy it of me
7340,_ABAS._,For half its value.
7341,_ABAS._,
7342,_ABAS._,_Deid._           May I take these two
7343,_ABAS._,To view them nearly?
7344,_ABAS._,
7345,_ABAS._,_Ul._              All take as ye will.
7346,_ABAS._,"Ye do me honour, ladies."
7347,_ABAS._,
7348,_ABAS._,"_Deid._                Hear ye, girls,                         950"
7349,_ABAS._,Make each her choice. I will o’erlook your taste
7350,_ABAS._,When all is done.
7351,_ABAS._,
7352,_ABAS._,"_Ul._           Come, buy my wares: come buy."
7353,_ABAS._,"Come, come buy; I’ve wares for all,"
7354,_ABAS._,Were ye each and all princesses.
7355,_ABAS._,"Clasps and brooches, large and small,"
7356,_ABAS._,Handy for holding your flowing dresses.
7357,_ABAS._,
7358,_ABAS._,_Ch._ What is this little box for?
7359,_ABAS._,
7360,_ABAS._,_Ul._                            Open it.
7361,_ABAS._,
7362,_ABAS._,_Ch._ What is this vial?
7363,_ABAS._,
7364,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                  Smell it. Buy, come buy!"
7365,_ABAS._,"Charms for lovers, charms to break,"

7369,_ABAS._,
7370,_ABAS._,_Ch._ O smell this scent.—Here be fine pins.—See this!
7371,_ABAS._,
7372,_ABAS._,_Ul._ (_aside_). I spy none here to match my notion yet.
7373,_ABAS._,
7374,_ABAS._,_Ch._ I have found amber beads.—What is it is tied
7375,_ABAS._,In little packets?
7376,_ABAS._,
7377,_ABAS._,"_Ul._            Toilet secrets those,"
7378,_ABAS._,"Perfumes, and rare cosmetics ’gainst decay."
7379,_ABAS._,
7380,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ (_to one apart_). Alexia, see. I will buy this for Pyrrha."
7381,_ABAS._,’Tis pity she is not here. What thinkest thou of it?
7382,_ABAS._,He said it was his best. This other one                          970
7383,_ABAS._,I’ll give to thee if thou find nothing better.
7384,_ABAS._,Go see. I will seek Pyrrha.      [_Exit._
7385,_ABAS._,
7386,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                     Buy, come buy!"
7387,_ABAS._,"Tassels, fringes, silken strings,"

7391,_ABAS._,
7392,_ABAS._,"_Ch._ Pray, what are these, good man?"
7393,_ABAS._,
7394,_ABAS._,_Ul._                               Of soft doe-skin
7395,_ABAS._,"These gilded thongs are made for dancers’ wear,"
7396,_ABAS._,To tie their sandals.
7397,_ABAS._,
7398,_ABAS._,"_Ch._               And is this a pin,"
7399,_ABAS._,This golden grasshopper?
7400,_ABAS._,
7401,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                  Ay, for the hair.                       980"
7402,_ABAS._,The Athenian ladies use nought else. See here
7403,_ABAS._,This little cup.
7404,_ABAS._,
7405,_ABAS._,_Ch._          Didst thou make that?
7406,_ABAS._,
7407,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                              Nay, ladies."
7408,_ABAS._,
7409,_ABAS._,_Ch._ Show us some work of thine which thou didst make
7410,_ABAS._,Thy very self.
7411,_ABAS._,
7412,_ABAS._,_Ul._        See then this silver snake.
7413,_ABAS._,"Fear not. Come near and mark him well: my trade is,"
7414,_ABAS._,"Or was, I should say, in such nice devices."
7415,_ABAS._,"’Twill coil and curl, uncoil, dart and recoil.      [_Showing._"
7416,_ABAS._,
7417,_ABAS._,"_The Chorus crowd about him, when enter unperceived"
7418,_ABAS._,by him Achilles and Deidamia._
7419,_ABAS._,
7420,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Come, come, there never hath been one like him here."
7421,_ABAS._,Hark! see the girls: they crowd and chatter round
7422,_ABAS._,As greedily as birds being fed. I bade them choose
7423,_ABAS._,"Each one a present, but I took the best,                         991"
7424,_ABAS._,This ruby brooch. Look at it: ’tis for thee.
7425,_ABAS._,Let me now put it on thee. I’ll unclasp
7426,_ABAS._,Thy robe and set it in the place of the other.
7427,_ABAS._,
7428,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Nay, Deidamia, unfasten not my robe!"
7429,_ABAS._,
7430,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Why, ’twould not matter if he looked this way."
7431,_ABAS._,
7432,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Nay, prithee.—"
7433,_ABAS._,
7434,_ABAS._,"_Deid._              Well, thou must take my gift."
7435,_ABAS._,
7436,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Then must I give thee somewhat in return.
7437,_ABAS._,
7438,_ABAS._,_Deid._ But ’tis my will to-day to give to all.
7439,_ABAS._,
7440,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Then let me take my choice, some smaller thing.        1000"
7441,_ABAS._,
7442,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Come then ere all is ransacked.
7443,_ABAS._,
7444,_ABAS._,_Ach._ (_aside_).                       I scarce escaped
7445,_ABAS._,The uncovering of my magic coat.—[_They go to Ulysses._
7446,_ABAS._,
7447,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                            Come buy,"
7448,_ABAS._,"Needles for your broideries rare,"
7449,_ABAS._,Dainty bodkins silver-hafted.
7450,_ABAS._,"Pins to fix your plaited hair,"
7451,_ABAS._,Ivory-headed and golden-shafted.
7452,_ABAS._,
7453,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ What hast thou in thy pack for me, old man?"
7454,_ABAS._,
7455,_ABAS._,"_Ul._ There’s nought but trifles left me, lady, now,"
7456,_ABAS._,As dice and dolls; the very dregs of the box.
7457,_ABAS._,
7458,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Athenian owls. And who’s this red-baked lady
7459,_ABAS._,Clothed in a net?
7460,_ABAS._,
7461,_ABAS._,"_Ul._           Princess, ’tis Britomartis,                   1011"
7462,_ABAS._,The Cretan goddess worshipped at Ægina.
7463,_ABAS._,
7464,_ABAS._,_Deid._ This little serpent too?
7465,_ABAS._,
7466,_ABAS._,_Ul._                          Nothing to thee:
7467,_ABAS._,But the Erechtheidæ use to fasten such
7468,_ABAS._,"About their children’s necks. Nay, not a babe"
7469,_ABAS._,"Is born but they must don him one of these,"
7470,_ABAS._,Or ever he be swaddled or have suck.
7471,_ABAS._,
7472,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ This blinking pygmy here, with a man’s body"
7473,_ABAS._,"And a dog’s head, squatting upon a button..."
7474,_ABAS._,What’s he?
7475,_ABAS._,
7476,_ABAS._,"_Ul._    ’Tis an Egyptian charm, to ban                       1020"
7477,_ABAS._,The evil spirits bred of Nilus’ slime.
7478,_ABAS._,
7479,_ABAS._,_Deid._ And this?
7480,_ABAS._,
7481,_ABAS._,"_Ul._           That. See, ’tis a Medusa, lady,"
7482,_ABAS._,"Cut in an oyster-shell, with flaming snakes."
7483,_ABAS._,
7484,_ABAS._,_Deid._ These are all nothings. Thou must have the brooch.
7485,_ABAS._,"See, now ’tis thine; thou hast it. (_Pins it upon Achilles’ robe._)"
7486,_ABAS._,(_To Ul._) What is its price?
7487,_ABAS._,"(_To Ach._) Nay, be content."
7488,_ABAS._,
7489,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                    To thee I’ll sell it, lady,"
7490,_ABAS._,For a tenfold weight of gold.
7491,_ABAS._,
7492,_ABAS._,_Ach._                      Oh! ’tis too much.
7493,_ABAS._,"Spend not such store on me. And for the ruby,"
7494,_ABAS._,’Tis dark and small.
7495,_ABAS._,
7496,_ABAS._,_Ul._              The purple is its merit:
7497,_ABAS._,"Were it three times the size and half the tint,                 1030"
7498,_ABAS._,’Twere of slight cost.
7499,_ABAS._,
7500,_ABAS._,_Ach._               So might I like it better.
7501,_ABAS._,"And that—what’s that, which thou dost put aside?"
7502,_ABAS._,Is that a toy?
7503,_ABAS._,
7504,_ABAS._,"_Ul._        Nay, lady; that is no toy."
7505,_ABAS._,’Tis a sharp sword. But I will show it thee
7506,_ABAS._,For its strange quality: the which methinks
7507,_ABAS._,"Might pass for magic, were’t not that an Arian,"
7508,_ABAS._,"Late come to Sardis, knows the art to make it."
7509,_ABAS._,"Tho’ wrought of iron, look ye, ’tis blue as flint,"
7510,_ABAS._,"And if I bend it, it springs back like a bow:"
7511,_ABAS._,"’Tis sharper too than flint; but the edge is straight,"
7512,_ABAS._,"And will not chip. Nay, touch it not; have care!"
7513,_ABAS._,
7514,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Pray, let me see it, and take it in my hand."
7515,_ABAS._,
7516,_ABAS._,[_Takes it and comes to front._
7517,_ABAS._,
7518,_ABAS._,_Ul._ (_aside_). This should be he.
7519,_ABAS._,
7520,_ABAS._,_Ach._ (_aside_).                 My arm writhes at the touch.
7521,_ABAS._,
7522,_ABAS._,"_Ul._ There is a hunter, with his game, a lion,"
7523,_ABAS._,Inlaid upon it: and on the other side                           1045
7524,_ABAS._,Two men that fight to death.
7525,_ABAS._,
7526,_ABAS._,_Ach._                     ’Tis light in the hand.
7527,_ABAS._,
7528,_ABAS._,_Deid._ (_to Ach._). Canst thou imagine any use for this?
7529,_ABAS._,
7530,_ABAS._,_Ach._ (_to Deid._). Not when thy father dies?
7531,_ABAS._,
7532,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                                             Ladies, have care."
7533,_ABAS._,"For if the sword should wound you, I were blamed."
7534,_ABAS._,
7535,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Why, thinkest thou ’tis only bearded men"
7536,_ABAS._,Can wield a sword? The queen of the Amazons
7537,_ABAS._,Could teach thee something maugre thy white hair.
7538,_ABAS._,
7539,_ABAS._,_Ul._ (_aside_). The game hath run into the snare;
7540,_ABAS._,He is mine.
7541,_ABAS._,
7542,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ See, Deidamia, here’s my choice; buy this"
7543,_ABAS._,If thou wilt give me something; thou dost like                  1055
7544,_ABAS._,"The ruby; if thou wilt let me give thee that,"
7545,_ABAS._,Thou in return buy me this little sword.
7546,_ABAS._,
7547,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Such presents are ill-omened, and ’tis said"
7548,_ABAS._,Will shrewdly cut in twain the love they pledge.
7549,_ABAS._,
7550,_ABAS._,_Ach._ But we may make a bond of this divider.
7551,_ABAS._,
7552,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Wilt thou in earnest take it for thy choice?
7553,_ABAS._,
7554,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ If thou wert late in earnest, thou couldst do"
7555,_ABAS._,No better than arm all thy girls with these.
7556,_ABAS._,"The weapon wins the battle, and I think"
7557,_ABAS._,With such advantage women might be feared.
7558,_ABAS._,"(_To Ul._) Old man, I like thy blade; and I will have it."
7559,_ABAS._,I see ’twould thrust well: tell me if ’tis mettle
7560,_ABAS._,"To give a stroke. Suppose I were thy foe,"
7561,_ABAS._,And standing o’er thee thus to cut thee down
7562,_ABAS._,Should choose to cleave thy pate. Would this sword do it?       1070
7563,_ABAS._,
7564,_ABAS._,_Ul._ (_aside_). He knows me!
7565,_ABAS._,
7566,_ABAS._,[_Pulling off his beard and head-dress and leaping up._
7567,_ABAS._,
7568,_ABAS._,Achilles!
7569,_ABAS._,
7570,_ABAS._,_Deid. and Ch._             Help! help! treachery!
7571,_ABAS._,
7572,_ABAS._,[_They fly._
7573,_ABAS._,
7574,_ABAS._,_Diomede comes out of bushes where he stands unseen
7575,_ABAS._,by Achilles._
7576,_ABAS._,
7577,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Beardless—and smooth of face as tongue:

7579,_ABAS._,"Gentle, but sturdy of body: ruddy locks,"
7580,_ABAS._,And restless eye .. Ulysses!
7581,_ABAS._,
7582,_ABAS._,_Ul._                       Thou hast it.
7583,_ABAS._,
7584,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ I knew that thou wert here, but looked to meet thee1075"
7585,_ABAS._,"Without disguises, as an honest man."
7586,_ABAS._,
7587,_ABAS._,"_Ul._ Thou needest a mirror, lady, for thyself."
7588,_ABAS._,
7589,_ABAS._,_Ach._ (_suddenly casts off his long robe and appears in
7590,_ABAS._,"shining armour, still holding the sword_)."
7591,_ABAS._,
7592,_ABAS._,Behold!.... Be thou my mirror!
7593,_ABAS._,
7594,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                       If I be not,"
7595,_ABAS._,"’Tis shame to thee, the cause of my disguise."
7596,_ABAS._,
7597,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ I own thee not. I knew thee for a prince,"
7598,_ABAS._,But seeing thee so vilely disfigured...
7599,_ABAS._,
7600,_ABAS._,_Ul._                                  Stay!                  1081
7601,_ABAS._,We both have used disguise: I call for judgment
7602,_ABAS._,"Upon the motive. Mine I donned for valour,"
7603,_ABAS._,And care for thy renown; thine was for fear.
7604,_ABAS._,
7605,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Fear! By the gods: take up thy beard again,"
7606,_ABAS._,And thy mock dotage shield thee.
7607,_ABAS._,
7608,_ABAS._,"_Ul._                          Nay, Achilles;"
7609,_ABAS._,If I spake wrong I will recall the word.
7610,_ABAS._,
7611,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Thou didst unutterably lie. Recall it.
7612,_ABAS._,
7613,_ABAS._,_Ul._ Wilt thou then sail to Aulis in my ship?
7614,_ABAS._,
7615,_ABAS._,_Ach._ I can sail thither and not sail with thee.
7616,_ABAS._,
7617,_ABAS._,_Ul._ But wilt thou come?
7618,_ABAS._,
7619,_ABAS._,_Ach._                  I answer not to thee
7620,_ABAS._,Because thou questionest me: but since I know
7621,_ABAS._,"What will be, and hear thee in ignorance"
7622,_ABAS._,"Slander fair names, I tell thee that Achilles"
7623,_ABAS._,Will come to Aulis.
7624,_ABAS._,
7625,_ABAS._,_Ul._             Wherefore now so long                       1095
7626,_ABAS._,Hast thou denied thyself to thy renown?
7627,_ABAS._,
7628,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Thou saidst for fear; nor hast recalled the word.
7629,_ABAS._,
7630,_ABAS._,_Ul._ ’Twas first thy taunt which drew my mind from me:
7631,_ABAS._,"But, if it wrong thee, I recall the word."
7632,_ABAS._,
7633,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ I think thou hast judged me by thyself, Ulysses."
7634,_ABAS._,"When thou wast summoned to the war,—who wert"
7635,_ABAS._,"Not free to choose as I, but bound by oath"
7636,_ABAS._,"To Menelaus to help him,—what didst thou?"
7637,_ABAS._,Why thou didst feign; and looking for disguise
7638,_ABAS._,Thy wit persuaded thee that they who knew thee
7639,_ABAS._,Would never deem that thou wouldst willingly
7640,_ABAS._,"Make mock of that: so thou didst put on madness,"
7641,_ABAS._,Babbling and scrabbling even before thy friends:
7642,_ABAS._,And hadst been slavering on thy native rocks
7643,_ABAS._,"Unto this day, had not one fellow there                         1110"
7644,_ABAS._,"Lightly unravelled thee, and in the furrow,"
7645,_ABAS._,"Which thou with dumb delusion, morn and eve,"
7646,_ABAS._,"Didst plough in the sea sand (that was thy trick),"
7647,_ABAS._,He placed thy new-born babe. That thou brok’st down
7648,_ABAS._,"Then in thine acting, that thou drav’st not on"
7649,_ABAS._,"The share thro’ thine own flesh, is the best praise"
7650,_ABAS._,I have to give thee.
7651,_ABAS._,
7652,_ABAS._,"_Ul._              Distinguish! if I feigned,"
7653,_ABAS._,"’Twas that I had a child and wife, whose ties"
7654,_ABAS._,Of tenderness I am not ashamed to own.
7655,_ABAS._,
7656,_ABAS._,_Ach._ I say thou wentest not unto this war                   1120
7657,_ABAS._,"But by compulsion, thou, that chargest me"
7658,_ABAS._,"With fear. ’Tis thou that art the stay-at-home,"
7659,_ABAS._,"Not I; my heart was ever for the war,"
7660,_ABAS._,And ’gainst my will I have been withheld: that thou
7661,_ABAS._,"Mistakest in this my duty for my leaning,"
7662,_ABAS._,"Is more impeachment of thy boasted wits,"
7663,_ABAS._,Than was thy empty husbandry. Are not
7664,_ABAS._,"The Argive chiefs more subject, one and all,"
7665,_ABAS._,To this reproach of fear? Why need they me
7666,_ABAS._,A boy of sixteen years to lead them on?                         1130
7667,_ABAS._,"Did they lack ships or men, what are my people"
7668,_ABAS._,In number? who am I in strength? what rank
7669,_ABAS._,Have I in Hellas? Where’s the burly Ajax?
7670,_ABAS._,Where is the son of Herakles? and Nestor
7671,_ABAS._,The aged? Teucer and Idomeneus?
7672,_ABAS._,"Menestheus, Menelaus? and not least"
7673,_ABAS._,Where’s Diomede?
7674,_ABAS._,
7675,_ABAS._,_Dio._ (_coming forward_). By chance he’s here.
7676,_ABAS._,
7677,_ABAS._,_Ach._                                       Ah! now
7678,_ABAS._,"I hear a soldier’s voice. Brave Diomede,"
7679,_ABAS._,"I give thee welcome, tho’ thou comest behind."
7680,_ABAS._,
7681,_ABAS._,"_Dio._ Hail, son of Thetis, champion of the Greeks!"
7682,_ABAS._,
7683,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Anon, anon. What dost thou here? Wert thou             1141"
7684,_ABAS._,"Sat in an ambush or arrived by chance,"
7685,_ABAS._,As thou didst say?
7686,_ABAS._,
7687,_ABAS._,_Dio._           By heaven I cannot tell.
7688,_ABAS._,"I serve Ulysses, and he serves the gods:"
7689,_ABAS._,"If thou’rt displeased with them, gibe not at me."
7690,_ABAS._,
7691,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ I see the plan—The pedlar here in front,"
7692,_ABAS._,The lion behind. And so ye thought to seize me.
7693,_ABAS._,
7694,_ABAS._,_Ul._ Have we not done it?
7695,_ABAS._,
7696,_ABAS._,_Ach._                   Nay.
7697,_ABAS._,
7698,_ABAS._,_Ul._                       Thou canst not scape.
7699,_ABAS._,
7700,_ABAS._,_Ach._ I give that back to thee.
7701,_ABAS._,
7702,_ABAS._,_Ul._                          What wilt thou now?
7703,_ABAS._,
7704,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Diomede and I have swords: thou mayst stand by         1150
7705,_ABAS._,Until ’tis time thou show me how to escape.
7706,_ABAS._,I’ll drive you to your ship.
7707,_ABAS._,
7708,_ABAS._,_Ul._ (_aside to Dio._).
7709,_ABAS._,Answer him not. He cannot leave the isle:
7710,_ABAS._,When the king learns of our discovery
7711,_ABAS._,He must deliver him up. Let’s to the palace.
7712,_ABAS._,
7713,_ABAS._,"_Dio._ (_to Ul._). Nay, I must speak—"
7714,_ABAS._,
7715,_ABAS._,_Ul._                               Thou wilt but anger him.
7716,_ABAS._,He will yield better if we cross him not.
7717,_ABAS._,
7718,_ABAS._,"_Dio._ (_to Ach._). Brave son of Thetis, I’d not yield"
7719,_ABAS._,to thee
7720,_ABAS._,"In any trial of strength, tho’ thou be clad"
7721,_ABAS._,In heavenly armour; but I came not here                         1160
7722,_ABAS._,"To fight, and least with thee: put up thy sword."
7723,_ABAS._,"And since I heard thee say thou wilt to Aulis,"
7724,_ABAS._,"Our mission is accomplished, nought remains"
7725,_ABAS._,"But to renounce our acting, and atone"
7726,_ABAS._,For what we have ventured. First I speak thee free
7727,_ABAS._,To follow thine own way. Unless the king
7728,_ABAS._,"Or other here be in thy secrecy,"
7729,_ABAS._,"None know but we, nor shall know: be it thy will,"
7730,_ABAS._,"My lips are sealed, and in whatever else"
7731,_ABAS._,"Thou wilt command me, I shall be glad to obey."
7732,_ABAS._,
7733,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Thank thee, good Diomede. What saith Ulysses?          1171"
7734,_ABAS._,
7735,_ABAS._,_Ul._ I’ll do whate’er will knit thee to our cause.
7736,_ABAS._,(_Aside._) Yet shall men hear I found thee.
7737,_ABAS._,
7738,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Return then to your ship; and when Ulysses
7739,_ABAS._,Is there restored proceed ye to the court.
7740,_ABAS._,But what in the surprise and consequence
7741,_ABAS._,"Of my discovery to the king, as well"
7742,_ABAS._,"As to some others may arise, I know not;"
7743,_ABAS._,Nor can instruct your good behaviours further.
7744,_ABAS._,Time grants me but short counsel for myself.                    1180
7745,_ABAS._,
7746,_ABAS._,_Ul._ We too should study how to meet the king.
7747,_ABAS._,
7748,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Stay yet, Ulysses. Thou hast parted here"
7749,_ABAS._,With goods appraised to them that meant to buy.
7750,_ABAS._,"I have a full purse with me. Be content,"
7751,_ABAS._,Take it. I’d give as much for the little sword.
7752,_ABAS._,Now let me do this favour to the ladies.
7753,_ABAS._,
7754,_ABAS._,"_Ul._ (_taking_). ’Tis fit, and fairly done. I did not think"
7755,_ABAS._,To go off robbed. The sword is worth the gold.
7756,_ABAS._,We part in honest dealing. Fare thee well.                      1189
7757,_ABAS._,
7758,_ABAS._,_Dio._ (_aside_). Thrashed like a witless cur!
7759,_ABAS._,"(_To Ach._)                                    Farewell, Achilles."
7760,_ABAS._,An hour hence we will meet thee at the palace.
7761,_ABAS._,
7762,_ABAS._,[_Exeunt Ul. and Dio._
7763,_ABAS._,
7764,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ In spite of warning taken in a silly trap,"
7765,_ABAS._,By the common plotter! Thus to be known Achilles—
7766,_ABAS._,To have my wish forced on me against my will
7767,_ABAS._,Hath rudely cleared my sight. Where lies the gain?
7768,_ABAS._,The dancing ship on which I sailed is wrecked
7769,_ABAS._,"On an unlovely shore, and I must climb"
7770,_ABAS._,"Out of the wreck upon a loveless shore,"
7771,_ABAS._,Saving what best I love. ’Tis so. I see
7772,_ABAS._,"I shall command these men, and in their service"
7773,_ABAS._,Find little solace. I have a harder task                        1201
7774,_ABAS._,"Than chieftainship, and how to wear my arms"
7775,_ABAS._,With as much nature as yon girlish robe:
7776,_ABAS._,To pass from that to this without reproach
7777,_ABAS._,"Of honour, and beneath my breastplate keep"
7778,_ABAS._,With the high generalship of all the Greeks
7779,_ABAS._,"My tenderest love. ’Tis now to unmask that,"
7780,_ABAS._,And hold uninjured. I’ll make no excuse
7781,_ABAS._,"To the old king but my necessity,"
7782,_ABAS._,And boldly appease him. Here by chance he comes.
7783,_ABAS._,
7784,_ABAS._,_Enter hurriedly Lycomedes and Abas._
7785,_ABAS._,
7786,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._ Was it not here, they said?                            1211"
7787,_ABAS._,An insolent ruffian: Let me come across him!
7788,_ABAS._,"By heav’n, still here! And armed from head to foot!"
7789,_ABAS._,"(_To Ach._) Young man,—as now thou’lt not deny to be—"
7790,_ABAS._,"Thou’st done—ay, tho’ thou seem of princely make—"
7791,_ABAS._,Dishonour and offence to me the king
7792,_ABAS._,In venturing here to parley with the princess
7793,_ABAS._,"In mock disguise, for whatsoever cause,"
7794,_ABAS._,"Strangely put on and suddenly cast off,"
7795,_ABAS._,I am amazed to think. I bid thee tell me                        1220
7796,_ABAS._,What was thy purpose hither.
7797,_ABAS._,
7798,_ABAS._,"_Ach._                     O honoured king,"
7799,_ABAS._,Tho’ I came here disguised I am not he
7800,_ABAS._,Thou thinkest.
7801,_ABAS._,
7802,_ABAS._,_Lyc._       Nay I think not who thou art.
7803,_ABAS._,All wonders that I have seen are lost in thee.
7804,_ABAS._,
7805,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Thou takest me for Ulysses.
7806,_ABAS._,
7807,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._                           Nay, not I."
7808,_ABAS._,
7809,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ I am Achilles, sire, the son of Thetis."
7810,_ABAS._,
7811,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ Achilles! Ah! Thou sayst at least a name
7812,_ABAS._,"That fits thy starlike presence, my rebuke"
7813,_ABAS._,Not knowing who thou wert. But now I see thee
7814,_ABAS._,"I need no witness, and forget my wonder                         1230"
7815,_ABAS._,Wherefore the Argives tarry on the shore
7816,_ABAS._,"And the gods speak thy praise. Welcome then hither,"
7817,_ABAS._,"Achilles, son of Thetis; welcome hither!"
7818,_ABAS._,"And be I first to honour thee, who was"
7819,_ABAS._,Most blamèd in thine absence.
7820,_ABAS._,
7821,_ABAS._,"_Ach._                      Gracious sire,"
7822,_ABAS._,"Thy welcome is all kingly, if it bear"
7823,_ABAS._,Forgiveness of offence.
7824,_ABAS._,
7825,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._                To speak of that,"
7826,_ABAS._,"Another might have wronged me, but not thou."
7827,_ABAS._,Tho’ much I crave to learn both how and why                     1239
7828,_ABAS._,Thou camest hither. Was’t in the Argive ship?
7829,_ABAS._,
7830,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ Nay, king, I came not in the Argive ship:"
7831,_ABAS._,Nor am I that false trespasser thou seekest.
7832,_ABAS._,
7833,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._ Whether then hast thou mounted from the deep,"
7834,_ABAS._,Where the sea nymphs till now have loved and held thee
7835,_ABAS._,From men’s desire; or whether from the sky
7836,_ABAS._,"Hath some god wrapt thee in a morning cloud,"
7837,_ABAS._,"And laid thee with the sunlight on this isle,"
7838,_ABAS._,Where they that seek should find thee?
7839,_ABAS._,
7840,_ABAS._,_Ach._                               A god it was
7841,_ABAS._,"Brought me, but not to-day: seven times the moon"
7842,_ABAS._,"Hath lost her lamp with loitering, since the night"
7843,_ABAS._,She shone upon my passage; and so long                          1251
7844,_ABAS._,"I have served thee in disguise, and won thy love."
7845,_ABAS._,
7846,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ So long hast thou been here! And I unknowing
7847,_ABAS._,Have pledged my kingly oath—The gods forbid—
7848,_ABAS._,
7849,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Yet was I here because a goddess bade.
7850,_ABAS._,
7851,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ Have I then ever seen thee?
7852,_ABAS._,
7853,_ABAS._,_Ach._                           Every hour
7854,_ABAS._,"Thou hast seen me, and sheltered me beneath thy roof."
7855,_ABAS._,"But since thou knewest me not, thy royal word"
7856,_ABAS._,Was hurt not by denial.
7857,_ABAS._,
7858,_ABAS._,_Lyc._                Who wert thou? Say.
7859,_ABAS._,
7860,_ABAS._,_Ach._ I was called Pyrrha.                                   1260
7861,_ABAS._,
7862,_ABAS._,_Lyc._                    O shame.
7863,_ABAS._,
7864,_ABAS._,"_Ach._                           Yet hearken, sire!"
7865,_ABAS._,
7866,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._ Wast thou the close attendant of my daughter,"
7867,_ABAS._,"Her favoured comrade, and she held it hid"
7868,_ABAS._,"’Neath a familiar countenance before me,"
7869,_ABAS._,So false unto her modesty and me?
7870,_ABAS._,Alas! alas!
7871,_ABAS._,
7872,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ O sire, she hath known me but as thou, and loved"
7873,_ABAS._,Not knowing whom.
7874,_ABAS._,
7875,_ABAS._,_Lyc._          Thou sayst she hath not known?
7876,_ABAS._,
7877,_ABAS._,_Ach._ For ’twas a goddess framed me this disguise.
7878,_ABAS._,
7879,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ And never guessed?
7880,_ABAS._,
7881,_ABAS._,"_Ach._                  Nay, sire. Nor blame the goddess"
7882,_ABAS._,"Whom I obeyed: nor where I have done no wrong,"
7883,_ABAS._,Make my necessity a crime against thee.                         1271
7884,_ABAS._,
7885,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ Can I believe?
7886,_ABAS._,
7887,_ABAS._,"_Ach._              ’Tis true I have loved her, sire:"
7888,_ABAS._,"And by strange wooing if I have won her love,"
7889,_ABAS._,And now in the discovery can but offer
7890,_ABAS._,"A soldier’s lot,—she is free to choose: but thee"
7891,_ABAS._,"First I implore, be gracious to my suit,"
7892,_ABAS._,Nor scorn me for thy son.
7893,_ABAS._,
7894,_ABAS._,_Lyc._                  My son! Achilles!
7895,_ABAS._,"This day shall be the feast-day of my year,"
7896,_ABAS._,Tho’ I be made to all men a rebuke
7897,_ABAS._,"For being thy shelter, when I swore to all                      1280"
7898,_ABAS._,Thou wert not here. Now I rejoice thou wert.
7899,_ABAS._,Come to my palace as thyself: be now
7900,_ABAS._,My guest in earnest: we will seal at once
7901,_ABAS._,This happy contract.
7902,_ABAS._,
7903,_ABAS._,_Ach._             Let me first be known
7904,_ABAS._,Unto the princess and bespeak her will.
7905,_ABAS._,
7906,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._ She is thine, I say she is thine. Stay yet; that pedlar,"
7907,_ABAS._,Was he Ulysses?
7908,_ABAS._,
7909,_ABAS._,_Ach._        So he stole upon us;
7910,_ABAS._,And when I bought this sword he marked me out.
7911,_ABAS._,
7912,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ I cannot brook his mastery in deceit.
7913,_ABAS._,Where is he now?
7914,_ABAS._,
7915,_ABAS._,"_Ach._         I sent him to the ship,                        1290"
7916,_ABAS._,To find a fit apparel for thy sight.
7917,_ABAS._,
7918,_ABAS._,_Lyc._ Would I had caught him in his mean disguise!
7919,_ABAS._,
7920,_ABAS._,_Ach._ So mayst thou yet. Come with me the short way
7921,_ABAS._,And we will intercept him.
7922,_ABAS._,
7923,_ABAS._,"_Lyc._                   Abas, follow."
7924,_ABAS._,Thou too hast played a part I cannot like.
7925,_ABAS._,
7926,_ABAS._,"_Ab._ My liege, I have but unwittingly obeyed."
7927,_ABAS._,I have no higher trust.
7928,_ABAS._,
7929,_ABAS._,_Lyc._                Now obey me.      [_Exeunt._
7930,_ABAS._,
7931,_ABAS._,_Enter Deidamia and Chorus._
7932,_ABAS._,
7933,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Pyrrha, where art thou, Pyrrha?"
7934,_ABAS._,
7935,_ABAS._,_Ch._                                 She turned not back.—
7936,_ABAS._,They are not here.—She would not fly.—
7937,_ABAS._,
7938,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Pyrrha, Pyrrha!                                       1300"
7939,_ABAS._,
7940,_ABAS._,_Ch._ She hath driven the ugly pedlar and his pack
7941,_ABAS._,Home to his ship—would we had all been by!
7942,_ABAS._,Would we had joined the chase!
7943,_ABAS._,
7944,_ABAS._,_Deid._ He was no pedlar: I could see his face
7945,_ABAS._,When he pulled off his beard.
7946,_ABAS._,
7947,_ABAS._,"_Ch._   There as she stood,"
7948,_ABAS._,"Waving the sword, I feared"
7949,_ABAS._,To see a mortal stroke—
7950,_ABAS._,He hath fled into the wood—
7951,_ABAS._,"Had he no sword too, did none spy,                      1310"
7952,_ABAS._,Beneath his ragged cloke?
7953,_ABAS._,
7954,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Alas, alas!"
7955,_ABAS._,
7956,_ABAS._,_Ch._  What hast thou found?
7957,_ABAS._,
7958,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Woe, woe! alas, alas!"
7959,_ABAS._,"Pyrrha’s robe torn, and trampled on the ground."
7960,_ABAS._,See! see! O misery!
7961,_ABAS._,
7962,_ABAS._,_Ch._    ’Tis hers—’tis true—we see.
7963,_ABAS._,
7964,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Misery, misery! help who can."
7965,_ABAS._,
7966,_ABAS._,_Ch._    I have no help to give.—
7967,_ABAS._,I have no word to say.                                  1320
7968,_ABAS._,
7969,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Gods! do I live
7970,_ABAS._,To see this woe? The man
7971,_ABAS._,"Like some wild beast hath dragged her body away,"
7972,_ABAS._,"And left her robe. Ah, see the gift she spurned,"
7973,_ABAS._,My ruby jewel to my hand returned;
7974,_ABAS._,When forcing my accord
7975,_ABAS._,She chose the fatal sword.
7976,_ABAS._,The fool hath quite mistook her play.
7977,_ABAS._,
7978,_ABAS._,"_Ch._ He will have harmed her, if she be not slain."
7979,_ABAS._,"Ah, Pyrrha, Pyrrha!                                       1330"
7980,_ABAS._,Why ran we away?
7981,_ABAS._,
7982,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Why stand we here?
7983,_ABAS._,To the rescue: follow me.
7984,_ABAS._,
7985,_ABAS._,_Ch._  Whither—our cries are vain.
7986,_ABAS._,Maybe she lieth now close by
7987,_ABAS._,And hears but cannot make reply.
7988,_ABAS._,’Tis told how men have bound
7989,_ABAS._,"The mouths of them they bore away,"
7990,_ABAS._,Lest by their cry
7991,_ABAS._,They should be found.—                                    1340
7992,_ABAS._,"Spread our company into the woods around,"
7993,_ABAS._,And shouting as we go keep within hail.—
7994,_ABAS._,Or banding in parties search the paths about:
7995,_ABAS._,If many together shout
7996,_ABAS._,The sound is of more avail.
7997,_ABAS._,"Once more, together call her name once more."
7998,_ABAS._,(_Calling._) Pyrrha—Pyrrha!
7999,_ABAS._,
8000,_ABAS._,_Thetis_ (_within_).         Ha!
8001,_ABAS._,
8002,_ABAS._,_Deid._ An answer. Heard ye not?
8003,_ABAS._,
8004,_ABAS._,"_Ch._ ’Twas but the nymph, that from her hidden grot"
8005,_ABAS._,Mocks men with the repeated syllables                           1350
8006,_ABAS._,"Of their own voice, and nothing tells."
8007,_ABAS._,Such sound the answer bore.
8008,_ABAS._,
8009,_ABAS._,"_Deid._                         Nay, nay."
8010,_ABAS._,"Hark, for if ’twere but echo as ye say"
8011,_ABAS._,’Twill answer if I call again.
8012,_ABAS._,"(_Calls._) Pyrrha, come! Pyrrha, come!"
8013,_ABAS._,
8014,_ABAS._,"_Thetis_ (_within_). I come, I come."
8015,_ABAS._,
8016,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Heard ye not then?
8017,_ABAS._,
8018,_ABAS._,_Ch._ I heard the selfsame sound.
8019,_ABAS._,
8020,_ABAS._,_Deid._ ’Twas Pyrrha. Why she is found.
8021,_ABAS._,I know her voice. I hear her footing stir.                      1360
8022,_ABAS._,
8023,_ABAS._,"_Ch._ True, some one comes."
8024,_ABAS._,
8025,_ABAS._,_Deid._                   ’Tis she.
8026,_ABAS._,
8027,_ABAS._,_Enter Thetis._
8028,_ABAS._,
8029,_ABAS._,Pyrrha! O joy.
8030,_ABAS._,
8031,_ABAS._,_Th._        Why call ye her?
8032,_ABAS._,
8033,_ABAS._,_Deid._                     Pyrrha! Nay.
8034,_ABAS._,"And yet so like. Alas, beseech thee, lady"
8035,_ABAS._,"Or goddess, for I think that such thou art,"
8036,_ABAS._,Who answering from the wood our sorrowing call
8037,_ABAS._,"Now to our sight appearest,—hast thou regard"
8038,_ABAS._,"For her, whom thou so much resemblest, speak"
8039,_ABAS._,And tell us of thy pity if yet she lives                        1368
8040,_ABAS._,"Safe and unhurt, whom we have lost and mourn."
8041,_ABAS._,
8042,_ABAS._,"_Th._ ’Tis vain to weep her, as ’twere vain to seek."
8043,_ABAS._,Whom think ye that ye have lost?
8044,_ABAS._,
8045,_ABAS._,"_Deid._                        Pyrrha, my Pyrrha."
8046,_ABAS._,"As late we all fled frighted by a man,"
8047,_ABAS._,"Who stole on us disguised, she stayed behind:"
8048,_ABAS._,"For when we were got safe, she was not with us."
8049,_ABAS._,So we returned to seek her; but alas!
8050,_ABAS._,"Our fear is turned to terror. Lady, see!"
8051,_ABAS._,This is her garment trampled on the ground.
8052,_ABAS._,
8053,_ABAS._,_Th._ And so ye have found her. There was never more
8054,_ABAS._,Of her ye have callèd Pyrrha than that robe.
8055,_ABAS._,"The golden-headed maiden, the enchantress,                      1380"
8056,_ABAS._,And laughter-loving idol of your hearts
8057,_ABAS._,Had in your empty thought her only being.
8058,_ABAS._,"When ye have played with her, chosen her for queen,"
8059,_ABAS._,"And leader of your games, or when ye have sat"
8060,_ABAS._,"Rapt by the music of her voice, that sang"
8061,_ABAS._,"Heroic songs and histories of the gods,"
8062,_ABAS._,"Or at brisk morn, or long-delaying eve,"
8063,_ABAS._,"Have paced the shores of sunlight hand in hand,"
8064,_ABAS._,’Twas but a robe ye held: ye were deceived;
8065,_ABAS._,There was no Pyrrha.                                            1390
8066,_ABAS._,
8067,_ABAS._,_Ch._              What strange speech is this?
8068,_ABAS._,Was there no Pyrrha? What shall we believe!
8069,_ABAS._,
8070,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Lady, thy speech troubles mine ear in vain."
8071,_ABAS._,
8072,_ABAS._,_Th._ ’Tis then thine ear is vain; and not my speech.
8073,_ABAS._,
8074,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ My ears and eyes and hands have I believed,"
8075,_ABAS._,But not thy words. A moment since I held her.
8076,_ABAS._,What wilt thou say?
8077,_ABAS._,
8078,_ABAS._,_Th._             That eyes and hands and ears
8079,_ABAS._,"Deceived thy trust, but now thou hearest truth."
8080,_ABAS._,
8081,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Have we then dreamed, deluded by a shade"
8082,_ABAS._,"Fashioned of air or cloud, and as it seems"
8083,_ABAS._,"Made in thy likeness, or hath some god chosen"
8084,_ABAS._,To dwell awhile with us in privity                              1401
8085,_ABAS._,And mutual share of all our petty deeds?
8086,_ABAS._,Say what thy dark words hint and who thou art.
8087,_ABAS._,
8088,_ABAS._,"_Th._ I Thetis am, daughter of that old god,"
8089,_ABAS._,Whose wisdom buried in the deep hath made
8090,_ABAS._,"The unfathomed water solemn, and I rule"
8091,_ABAS._,"The ocean-nymphs, who for their pastime play"
8092,_ABAS._,"In the blue glooms, and darting here and there"
8093,_ABAS._,Checquer the dark and widespread melancholy
8094,_ABAS._,With everlasting laughter and bright smiles.                    1410
8095,_ABAS._,"Of me thou hast heard, and of my son Achilles,"
8096,_ABAS._,By prescient fame renowned first of the Greeks:
8097,_ABAS._,He is on this island: for ’twas here I set him
8098,_ABAS._,"To hide him from his foes, and he was safe"
8099,_ABAS._,Till thou betray’dst him—for unwittingly
8100,_ABAS._,"That hast thou done to-day. The seeming pedlar,"
8101,_ABAS._,"To whom thou leddest Pyrrha, was Ulysses,"
8102,_ABAS._,"Who spied to find Achilles, and thro’ thee"
8103,_ABAS._,"Found him, alas! Thy Pyrrha was Achilles."
8104,_ABAS._,
8105,_ABAS._,_Chorus._
8106,_ABAS._,
8107,_ABAS._,"O daughter of Nereus old,                               1420"
8108,_ABAS._,Queen of the nymphs that swim
8109,_ABAS._,"By day in gleams of gold,"
8110,_ABAS._,"By night in the silver dim,"
8111,_ABAS._,"Forgive in pity, we pray,"
8112,_ABAS._,Forgive the ill we have done.
8113,_ABAS._,Why didst thou hide this thing from us?
8114,_ABAS._,For if we had known thy son
8115,_ABAS._,"We had guarded him well to-day,"
8116,_ABAS._,Nor ever betrayed him thus.
8117,_ABAS._,
8118,_ABAS._,For though we may not ride                              1430
8119,_ABAS._,Thy tall sea-horses nor play
8120,_ABAS._,"In the rainbow-tinted spray,"
8121,_ABAS._,Nor dive down under the tide
8122,_ABAS._,"To the secret caves of the main,"
8123,_ABAS._,Among thy laughing train;
8124,_ABAS._,"Yet had we served thee well as they,"
8125,_ABAS._,Had we thy secret shared:
8126,_ABAS._,Nor ever had lost from garden and hall
8127,_ABAS._,"Pyrrha the golden-haired,"
8128,_ABAS._,Pyrrha beloved of all.                                  1440
8129,_ABAS._,
8130,_ABAS._,_Th._ (_to Deid._). Dost thou say nought?
8131,_ABAS._,
8132,_ABAS._,"_Deid._                                 Alas, alas! my Pyrrha."
8133,_ABAS._,
8134,_ABAS._,_Th._ Art thou lamenting still to have lost thy maid?
8135,_ABAS._,
8136,_ABAS._,_Deid._ I need no tongue to cry my shame; and yet
8137,_ABAS._,Thy mockery doth not grieve me like my loss.
8138,_ABAS._,
8139,_ABAS._,"_Th._ I came not here to mock thee, and forbid"
8140,_ABAS._,"Thy grief, that doth dishonour to my son."
8141,_ABAS._,
8142,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Nay, nay, that word is mine: speak it no more."
8143,_ABAS._,
8144,_ABAS._,_Th._ Weepest thou at comfort? Is deceit so dear
8145,_ABAS._,"To mortals, that to know good cannot match"
8146,_ABAS._,The joy of a delusion whatsoe’er?                               1450
8147,_ABAS._,
8148,_ABAS._,_Deid._ What joy was mine shame must forbid to tell.
8149,_ABAS._,
8150,_ABAS._,_Th._ Gods count it shame to be deceived: but men
8151,_ABAS._,Are shamed not by delusion of the gods.
8152,_ABAS._,
8153,_ABAS._,_Deid._ Then ye know nothing or do not respect.
8154,_ABAS._,
8155,_ABAS._,_Th._ Why what is this thou makest? the more ye have loved
8156,_ABAS._,"The more have ye delighted, and the joy"
8157,_ABAS._,I never grudged thee; tho’ there was not one
8158,_ABAS._,"In all my company of sea-born nymphs,"
8159,_ABAS._,"Who did not daily pray me, with white arms"
8160,_ABAS._,"Raised in the blue, to let her guard my son.                    1460"
8161,_ABAS._,And for his birthright he might well have taken
8162,_ABAS._,"The service of their sportive train, and lived"
8163,_ABAS._,On some fair desert isle away from men
8164,_ABAS._,Like a young god in worship and gay love.
8165,_ABAS._,"But since he is mortal, for his mortal mate"
8166,_ABAS._,"I chose out thee; to whom now were he lost,"
8167,_ABAS._,I would not blame thy well-deservèd tears:
8168,_ABAS._,"But lo, I am come to give thee joy, to call"
8169,_ABAS._,"Thee daughter, and prepare thee for the sight"
8170,_ABAS._,"Of such a lover, as no lady yet                                 1470"
8171,_ABAS._,Hath sat to await in chamber or in bower
8172,_ABAS._,On any wallèd hill or isle of Greece;
8173,_ABAS._,"Nor yet in Asian cities, whose dark queens"
8174,_ABAS._,Look from the latticed casements over seas
8175,_ABAS._,Of hanging gardens; nor doth all the world
8176,_ABAS._,Hold a memorial; not where Ægypt mirrors
8177,_ABAS._,The great smile of her kings and sunsmit fanes
8178,_ABAS._,In timeless silence: none hath been like him;
8179,_ABAS._,"And all the giant stones, which men have piled"
8180,_ABAS._,"Upon the illustrious dead, shall crumble and join"
8181,_ABAS._,"The desert dust, ere his high dirging Muse                      1481"
8182,_ABAS._,Be dispossessèd of the throne of song.
8183,_ABAS._,Await him here. While I thy willing maids
8184,_ABAS._,"Will lead apart, that they may learn what share"
8185,_ABAS._,To take in thy rejoicing. Follow me!
8186,_ABAS._,
8187,_ABAS._,"_Ch._ Come, come—we follow—we obey thee gladly—"
8188,_ABAS._,"We long to learn, goddess, what thou canst teach."
8189,_ABAS._,
8190,_ABAS._,[_Exeunt Th. and Chor._
8191,_ABAS._,
8192,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ Rejoice, she bids me. Ah me, tho’ all heaven spake,"
8193,_ABAS._,"I should weep bitterly. My tears, my shame"
8194,_ABAS._,"Will never leave me. Never now, nevermore                       1490"
8195,_ABAS._,"Can I find credit of grace, nor as a rock"
8196,_ABAS._,Stand ’twixt my maids and evil; even not deserving
8197,_ABAS._,"My father’s smile. Why honour we the gods,"
8198,_ABAS._,"Who reck not of our honour? How hath she,"
8199,_ABAS._,"Self-styled a goddess, mocked me, not respecting"
8200,_ABAS._,Maidenly modesty; but in the path
8201,_ABAS._,"Of grace, wherein I thought to walk enstated"
8202,_ABAS._,"High as my rank without reproach, she hath set"
8203,_ABAS._,"A snare for every step; that day by day,"
8204,_ABAS._,"From morn to night, I might do nothing well;                    1500"
8205,_ABAS._,But by most innocent seeming be betrayed
8206,_ABAS._,"To what most wounds a shamefast life, yielding"
8207,_ABAS._,To a man’s unfeignèd feigning; nay nor stayed
8208,_ABAS._,"Until I had given,—alas, how oft!—"
8209,_ABAS._,"My cheek to his lips, my body to his arms;"
8210,_ABAS._,"And thinking him a maid as I myself,"
8211,_ABAS._,"Have loved, kissed, and embraced him as a maid."
8212,_ABAS._,"O wretched, not to have seen what was so plain!"
8213,_ABAS._,Here on this bank no later than this morn
8214,_ABAS._,"Was I beguiled. There is no cure, no cure.                      1510"
8215,_ABAS._,"I’ll close my eyes for ever, nor see again"
8216,_ABAS._,"The things I have seen, nor be what I have been."
8217,_ABAS._,
8218,_ABAS._,[_Covers her face weeping._
8219,_ABAS._,
8220,_ABAS._,_Enter Achilles._
8221,_ABAS._,
8222,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ The voices that were here have ceased. Ah, there!"
8223,_ABAS._,"Not gone. ’Tis she, and by my cast-off robe"
8224,_ABAS._,"Sitting alone. I must speak comfort to her,"
8225,_ABAS._,"Whoe’er I seem. O Deidamia, see!"
8226,_ABAS._,Pyrrha is found. Weep not for her. I tell thee
8227,_ABAS._,"Thy Pyrrha is safe. Despair not. Nay, look up."
8228,_ABAS._,Dost thou not know my voice? ’Tis I myself.                     1519
8229,_ABAS._,"Look up, I am Pyrrha.—Ah, now what prayer or plea"
8230,_ABAS._,Made on my knees can aid me—If thou knowst all
8231,_ABAS._,And wilt not look on me? Yet if thou hearest
8232,_ABAS._,"Thou wilt forgive. Nay, if thou lovedst me not,"
8233,_ABAS._,"Or if I had wronged thee, thou wouldst scorn me now."
8234,_ABAS._,Thou dost not look. I am not changed. I loved thee
8235,_ABAS._,As like a maiden as I knew: if more
8236,_ABAS._,Was that a fault? Now as I am Achilles
8237,_ABAS._,"Revealed to-day to lead the Greeks to Troy,"
8238,_ABAS._,I count that nothing and bow down to thee
8239,_ABAS._,"Who hast made me fear,—                                         1530"
8240,_ABAS._,"Let me unveil thy eyes: tho’ thou wouldst hide me,"
8241,_ABAS._,Hide not thyself from me. If gentle force
8242,_ABAS._,Should show me that ’tis love that thou wouldst hide ...
8243,_ABAS._,And love I see. Look on me.
8244,_ABAS._,
8245,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ (_embracing_).    Ah Pyrrha, Pyrrha!"
8246,_ABAS._,
8247,_ABAS._,_Ach._ Thou dost forgive.
8248,_ABAS._,
8249,_ABAS._,_Deid._                 I never dreamed the truth.
8250,_ABAS._,
8251,_ABAS._,_Ach._ And wilt not now look on me!
8252,_ABAS._,
8253,_ABAS._,_Deid._                           I dare not look.
8254,_ABAS._,
8255,_ABAS._,_Ach._ What dost thou fear? A monster! I am not changed
8256,_ABAS._,"Save but my dress, and that an Amazon"
8257,_ABAS._,Might wear.
8258,_ABAS._,
8259,_ABAS._,"_Deid._   O, I see all."
8260,_ABAS._,
8261,_ABAS._,_Ach._                But who hath told thee?
8262,_ABAS._,
8263,_ABAS._,"_Deid._ There came one here much like thee when we called,1540"
8264,_ABAS._,Who said she was a goddess and thy mother.
8265,_ABAS._,
8266,_ABAS._,"_Ach._ ’Twas she that hid me in my strange disguise,"
8267,_ABAS._,Fearing the oracle.
8268,_ABAS._,
8269,_ABAS._,"_Deid._           She praised thee well,"
8270,_ABAS._,And said that thou wouldst come...
8271,_ABAS._,
8272,_ABAS._,"_Ach._                            What didst thou fear,"
8273,_ABAS._,Hiding thine eyes?
8274,_ABAS._,
8275,_ABAS._,_Deid._          I cannot speak the name.
8276,_ABAS._,Be Pyrrha still.
8277,_ABAS._,
8278,_ABAS._,_Ach._         Be that my name with thee.
8279,_ABAS._,Yet hath thy father called me son Achilles.
8280,_ABAS._,
8281,_ABAS._,_Deid._ He knows?
8282,_ABAS._,
8283,_ABAS._,_Ach._          There’s nought to hide: but let us hence.
8284,_ABAS._,"He is coming hither, and with him my foe."
8285,_ABAS._,"Let them not find us thus, and thee in tears.                   1550"

8442,_ABAS._,
8443,_ABAS._,_Ach._                     It darkly boded
8444,_ABAS._,That glory should be death.
8445,_ABAS._,
8446,_ABAS._,_Lyc._                    And so may be:
8447,_ABAS._,"Nay, very like. Yet men who would live well,"
8448,_ABAS._,"Weigh not these riddles, but unfold their life"
8449,_ABAS._,"From day to day. Do thou as seemeth best,"
8450,_ABAS._,Nor fear mysterious warnings of the powers.
8451,_ABAS._,"But, if my voice can reckon with thee at all,"
8452,_ABAS._,I’ll tell thee what myself I have grown to think:
8453,_ABAS._,That the best life is oft inglorious.                           1670
8454,_ABAS._,"Since the perfecting of ourselves, which seems"

8467,_ABAS._,
8468,_ABAS._,"_Ul._ This speech is idle, thou art bound to me."
8469,_ABAS._,
8470,_ABAS._,_Ach._ I hear you all: and lest it should be said
8471,_ABAS._,"I once was harsh and heedless, where such wrong"
8472,_ABAS._,"Were worse than cowardice, I now recall"

8478,_ABAS._,Our good king here hath praised—I will do this
8479,_ABAS._,If my bride bid me. Let her choose for me;
8480,_ABAS._,Her word shall rule me. If she set our pleasure
8481,_ABAS._,"Above my honour, I will call that duty,"
8482,_ABAS._,"And make it honourable, and so do well."
8483,_ABAS._,"But, as I know her, if she bid me go"
8484,_ABAS._,"Where fate and danger call, then I will go,"
8485,_ABAS._,"And so do better: and very sure it is,                          1700"

8525,THE FIRST PART OF NERO,"This play was not intended for the stage, as the rest of my plays are."
8526,THE FIRST PART OF NERO,It was written as an exercise in dramatic qualities other than scenic;
8527,THE FIRST PART OF NERO,"and had its publication been contemplated, I should have been more"
8528,THE FIRST PART OF NERO,careful not to deserve censure in one or two places: these however
8529,THE FIRST PART OF NERO,I have not thought it worth while to erase or correct. Owing to its
8530,THE FIRST PART OF NERO,"inordinate length I have found it necessary, so that the volumes of"
8531,THE FIRST PART OF NERO,"this series might be of uniform size, to couple with it the shortest of"

8537,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"is here out of order. Instead of standing second it should come fifth,"
8538,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,that is after _The Christian Captives_. The following note is taken
8539,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,from the first edition.
8540,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,
8541,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,_Note to_ Achilles in Scyros.—After I had begun this play I came by
8542,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"chance on _Calderon’s_ play on the same subject, _El Monstruo de los"
8543,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,Jardines_. The monster is _Achilles_; the gardens the same. Excepting
8544,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"an expression or two I found nothing that it suited me to use, and"
8545,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"I should not have recorded the circumstance, if it were not that"
8546,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,_Calderon’s_ play seemed to me to contain strong evidence that he had
8547,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"read _The Tempest_. This observation cannot be new, but I have never"
8548,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"met with it; so I offer it to my readers, thinking it will interest"
8549,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,them as it did me.
8550,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,
8551,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"_El Monstruo de los Jardines_ opens with a storm at sea, and shipwreck"
8552,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"of royal persons, similar as it is inferior to _Shakespeare’s_ (but"
8553,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,compare also the Devil’s shipwreck in the second act of _El magicio
8554,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"prodigioso_, which may be read in _Shelley’s_ translation). _Stephano_"
8555,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"has his counterpart,"
8556,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,
8557,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"_Un cofrade de Baco, que ha salido, Por no hacerle traicion, del mar á"
8558,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"nado Pues el no beber agua le ha escapado,_"
8559,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,
8560,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"and the whole play is then on a supposed desert island, which turns"
8561,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"out to be strangely peopled. There is the monster _Achilles_, who in"
8562,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"many respects remembers _Caliban_, and is even addressed as _Señor"
8563,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"monstruo_: ’_Monsieur Monster_.’ There is _Thetis_, who is to her"
8564,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"nymphs as _Prospero_ to his spirits; with musical enchantments, and"
8565,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"voices in the air, and even a _fantastico bajél_. _Calderon_ has"
8566,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,moreover hit upon the same device of imitative fancy as tempted
8567,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"_Dryden_ in like sad case, and pictured a man who had never seen a"
8568,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"woman. The island is wandered on by the prince and his suite, and one"
8569,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"of them says of it _Republica es entera_, &c. A curious reader might"
8570,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,find more than I have here noticed: but _Calderon_ is as far from
8571,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"sympathy with _Shakespeare_, as he is from the Greek story, with his"
8572,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,drums and trumpets and _El gran Sofí_.
8573,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,
8574,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,There is a passage in my _Achilles_ (_l. 518 and foll._) which is
8575,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,copied from _Calderon_: but this is after _Muley’s_ well-known speech
8576,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,in the _Principe Constante_ (see note to _The Christian Captives_);
8577,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"which is quoted in most books on _Calderon_. In my short play, which"
8578,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,"runs on without change of scene or necessary pause, I have had the"
8579,ACHILLES IN SCYROS,act and scene divisions indicated by greater and lesser spaces in the
