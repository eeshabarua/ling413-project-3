47,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
48,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
49,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"Two daughters fair the Marshal had,"
50,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,O grievous was their fate and sad.
51,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
52,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,The eldest she took her sister’s hand
53,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,And away they went to Sweden’s land.
54,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
55,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Home from the Stevn King Byrgye rode;
56,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Up to him Marsk Stig’s daughters trode.
57,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
58,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,“What women ye who beset my gate?
59,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,What brings ye hither at eve so late?”
60,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
61,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Daughters of Stig, the Marshal brave,"
62,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,So earnestly thee for help we crave.”
63,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
64,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Hence, hence away, ye outcasts two,"
65,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Your sire accurst my uncle slew.”
66,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
67,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Guiltless are we of Erik’s blood,"
68,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,So wide we wander in quest of food.”
69,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
70,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"The eldest she takes her sister’s hand,"
71,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,And away they went into Norway’s land.
72,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
73,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Home from the Ting King Erik rode
74,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Up to him Marsk Stig’s daughters trode.
75,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
76,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“What women are ye whom here I view,"
77,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,And what may ye in my country do?”
78,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
79,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Daughters of Stig, the Marshal brave"
80,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,So earnestly thee for help we crave.”
81,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
82,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,“To brew and bake full well ye know”—
83,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Alas, Sir King, not so, not so."
84,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
85,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“To brew and bake we do not know,"
86,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,We never stoop’d to employ so low.
87,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
88,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“To spin red gold that is our pride,"
89,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Our mother taught us ere she died.
90,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
91,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,“And we can weave galloon as well
92,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,As the maidens with the Queen that dwell.
93,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
94,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“We can weave red gold with wool,"
95,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"But oh, our hearts with grief are full."
96,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
97,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Had Marsk Stig stay’d in Denmark green,"
98,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Different far our fate had been.
99,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
100,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Had Ingeborg not chanc’d to die,"
101,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,We had not borne this misery.”
102,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
103,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,King Erik replied in gentle tone:
104,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,“I knew your father like my own;
105,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
106,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“He was a man in heart and hand,"
107,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Whose like lives not in any land.”
108,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
109,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"O’er them he threw his mantle red,"
110,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,To the ladies’ chamber them he led.
111,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
112,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"He bade them no more tears to shed,"
113,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,For he would stand in their father’s stead.
114,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
115,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"The eldest sister began the weft,"
116,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,The youngest finished what she left.
117,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
118,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,In the first lace she wove so true
119,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,The Virgin Mary and Christ Jesu.
120,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
121,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,And in the second of Norway land
122,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,She wove the Queen and her maiden band.
123,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
124,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"Of the antler’d hart they wove the chase,"
125,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,They wove themselves with pallid face.
126,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
127,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,They wove with nimble fingers small
128,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Of God the holy Angels all.
129,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
130,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"The youngest sister the woof up caught,"
131,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,And that before the Queen she brought.
132,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
133,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"Then into her eyes the tears they came,"
134,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Thou art not our Mother, Queenly Dame."
135,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
136,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“Wert thou our mother or sister dear,"
137,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,With praises thou our hearts wouldst cheer.
138,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
139,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"“But in thine eye no praise I see,"
140,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,Misfortune is our destiny.”
141,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
142,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"The eldest sicken’d, and sick she lay,"
143,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,The youngest tended her night and day.
144,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,
145,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,"The eldest died of grief of heart,"
146,MARSK STIG’S DAUGHTERS,The youngest liv’d with sorrow and smart.

154,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"There are three for my death that now pine,"

163,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,
164,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"But there is not one of the three,"
165,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"To the others though kindly affected,"
166,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,For both of their shares would agree
167,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,To resign his own portion expected.
168,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,
169,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"The Devil, so harsh and austere,"
170,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"Who only in evil hath joy,"
171,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,Would scorn to take body and gear
172,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"For my soul, that sweet beautiful toy."
173,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,
174,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,My children would rather possess
175,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"The gear I have toil’d so to gather,"
176,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"Though for me fervent love they profess,"
177,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,Than the body and soul of their father.
178,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,
179,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"The worms, though my children will make"
180,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"A lament when I’m laid in the hole,"
181,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,Would my body in preference take
182,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,To my gear or my beautiful soul.
183,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,
184,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"Oh, Christ! who wast hung on a tree,"
185,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,And wast pierc’d by a fool in his madness;
186,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,"Since each of them plund’ring would be,"
187,THE THREE EXPECTANTS,Send each disappointment and sadness.
