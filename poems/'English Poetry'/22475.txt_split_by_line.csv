41,BABY TORTOISE,BABY TORTOISE
42,BABY TORTOISE,
43,BABY TORTOISE,
44,BABY TORTOISE,"You know what it is to be born alone,"
45,BABY TORTOISE,Baby tortoise!
46,BABY TORTOISE,The first day to heave your feet little by little
47,BABY TORTOISE,"from the shell,"
48,BABY TORTOISE,"Not yet awake,"
49,BABY TORTOISE,"And remain lapsed on earth,"
50,BABY TORTOISE,Not quite alive.
51,BABY TORTOISE,
52,BABY TORTOISE,"A tiny, fragile, half-animate bean."
53,BABY TORTOISE,
54,BABY TORTOISE,"To open your tiny beak-mouth, that looks as if"
55,BABY TORTOISE,"it would never open,"
56,BABY TORTOISE,Like some iron door;
57,BABY TORTOISE,To lift the upper hawk-beak from the lower base
58,BABY TORTOISE,And reach your skinny little neck
59,BABY TORTOISE,And take your first bite at some dim bit of
60,BABY TORTOISE,"herbage,"
61,BABY TORTOISE,"Alone, small insect,"
62,BABY TORTOISE,"Tiny bright-eye,"
63,BABY TORTOISE,Slow one.
64,BABY TORTOISE,
65,BABY TORTOISE,To take your first solitary bite
66,BABY TORTOISE,"And move on your slow, solitary hunt."
67,BABY TORTOISE,"Your bright, dark little eye,"
68,BABY TORTOISE,"Your eye of a dark disturbed night,"
69,BABY TORTOISE,"Under its slow lid, tiny baby tortoise,"
70,BABY TORTOISE,So indomitable.
71,BABY TORTOISE,
72,BABY TORTOISE,No one ever heard you complain.
73,BABY TORTOISE,
74,BABY TORTOISE,"You draw your head forward, slowly, from your"
75,BABY TORTOISE,little wimple
76,BABY TORTOISE,"And set forward, slow-dragging, on your four-"
77,BABY TORTOISE,"pinned toes,"
78,BABY TORTOISE,Rowing slowly forward.
79,BABY TORTOISE,"Whither away, small bird?"
80,BABY TORTOISE,
81,BABY TORTOISE,"Rather like a baby working its limbs,"
82,BABY TORTOISE,"Except that you make slow, ageless progress"
83,BABY TORTOISE,And a baby makes none.
84,BABY TORTOISE,
85,BABY TORTOISE,"The touch of sun excites you,"
86,BABY TORTOISE,"And the long ages, and the lingering chill"
87,BABY TORTOISE,"Make you pause to yawn,"
88,BABY TORTOISE,"Opening your impervious mouth,"
89,BABY TORTOISE,"Suddenly beak-shaped, and very wide, like some"
90,BABY TORTOISE,suddenly gaping pincers;
91,BABY TORTOISE,"Soft red tongue, and hard thin gums,"
92,BABY TORTOISE,Then close the wedge of your little mountain
93,BABY TORTOISE,"front,"
94,BABY TORTOISE,"Your face, baby tortoise."
95,BABY TORTOISE,
96,BABY TORTOISE,"Do you wonder at the world, as slowly you turn"
97,BABY TORTOISE,your head in its wimple
98,BABY TORTOISE,"And look with laconic, black eyes?"
99,BABY TORTOISE,"Or is sleep coming over you again,"
100,BABY TORTOISE,The non-life?
101,BABY TORTOISE,
102,BABY TORTOISE,You are so hard to wake.
103,BABY TORTOISE,
104,BABY TORTOISE,Are you able to wonder?
105,BABY TORTOISE,
106,BABY TORTOISE,Or is it just your indomitable will and pride of
107,BABY TORTOISE,the first life
108,BABY TORTOISE,Looking round
109,BABY TORTOISE,And slowly pitching itself against the inertia
110,BABY TORTOISE,Which had seemed invincible?
111,BABY TORTOISE,
112,BABY TORTOISE,"The vast inanimate,"
113,BABY TORTOISE,And the fine brilliance of your so tiny eye.
114,BABY TORTOISE,
115,BABY TORTOISE,Challenger.
116,BABY TORTOISE,
117,BABY TORTOISE,"Nay, tiny shell-bird,"
118,BABY TORTOISE,"What a huge vast inanimate it is, that you must"
119,BABY TORTOISE,"row against,"
120,BABY TORTOISE,What an incalculable inertia.
121,BABY TORTOISE,
122,BABY TORTOISE,Challenger.
123,BABY TORTOISE,
124,BABY TORTOISE,"Little Ulysses, fore-runner,"
125,BABY TORTOISE,"No bigger than my thumb-nail,"
126,BABY TORTOISE,Buon viaggio.
127,BABY TORTOISE,
128,BABY TORTOISE,"All animate creation on your shoulder,"
129,BABY TORTOISE,"Set forth, little Titan, under your battle-shield."
130,BABY TORTOISE,
131,BABY TORTOISE,"The ponderous, preponderate,"
132,BABY TORTOISE,Inanimate universe;
133,BABY TORTOISE,"And you are slowly moving, pioneer, you alone."
134,BABY TORTOISE,
135,BABY TORTOISE,"How vivid your travelling seems now, in the"
136,BABY TORTOISE,"troubled sunshine,"
137,BABY TORTOISE,"Stoic, Ulyssean atom;"
138,BABY TORTOISE,"Suddenly hasty, reckless, on high toes."
139,BABY TORTOISE,
140,BABY TORTOISE,"Voiceless little bird,"
141,BABY TORTOISE,Resting your head half out of your wimple
142,BABY TORTOISE,In the slow dignity of your eternal pause.
143,BABY TORTOISE,"Alone, with no sense of being alone,"
144,BABY TORTOISE,And hence six times more solitary;
145,BABY TORTOISE,Fulfilled of the slow passion of pitching through
146,BABY TORTOISE,immemorial ages
147,BABY TORTOISE,Your little round house in the midst of chaos.
148,BABY TORTOISE,
149,BABY TORTOISE,"Over the garden earth,"
150,BABY TORTOISE,"Small bird,"
151,BABY TORTOISE,Over the edge of all things.
152,BABY TORTOISE,
153,BABY TORTOISE,"Traveller,"
154,BABY TORTOISE,With your tail tucked a little on one side
155,BABY TORTOISE,Like a gentleman in a long-skirted coat.
156,BABY TORTOISE,
157,BABY TORTOISE,"All life carried on your shoulder,"
158,BABY TORTOISE,Invincible fore-runner.
159,BABY TORTOISE,
160,BABY TORTOISE,"The Cross, the Cross"
161,BABY TORTOISE,"Goes deeper in than we know,"
162,BABY TORTOISE,Deeper into life;
163,BABY TORTOISE,Right into the marrow
164,BABY TORTOISE,And through the bone.
165,BABY TORTOISE,
166,BABY TORTOISE,
167,BABY TORTOISE,
168,BABY TORTOISE,
169,TORTOISE-SHELL,TORTOISE-SHELL
170,TORTOISE-SHELL,
171,TORTOISE-SHELL,
172,TORTOISE-SHELL,Along the back of the baby tortoise
173,TORTOISE-SHELL,"The scales are locked in an arch like a bridge,"
174,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Scale-lapping, like a lobster's sections"
175,TORTOISE-SHELL,Or a bee's.
176,TORTOISE-SHELL,
177,TORTOISE-SHELL,Then crossways down his sides
178,TORTOISE-SHELL,Tiger-stripes and wasp-bands.
179,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Five, and five again, and five again,"
180,TORTOISE-SHELL,"And round the edges twenty-five little ones,"
181,TORTOISE-SHELL,The sections of the baby tortoise shell.
182,TORTOISE-SHELL,
183,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Four, and a keystone;"
184,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Four, and a keystone;"
185,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Four, and a keystone;"
186,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Then twenty-four, and a tiny little keystone."
187,TORTOISE-SHELL,
188,TORTOISE-SHELL,It needed Pythagoras  to see life placing her
189,TORTOISE-SHELL,counters on the living back
190,TORTOISE-SHELL,Of the baby tortoise;
191,TORTOISE-SHELL,Life establishing the first eternal mathematical
192,TORTOISE-SHELL,"tablet,"
193,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Not in stone, like the Judean Lord, or bronze, but"
194,TORTOISE-SHELL,"in life-clouded, life-rosy tortoise-shell."
195,TORTOISE-SHELL,
196,TORTOISE-SHELL,The first little mathematical gentleman
197,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Stepping, wee mite, in his loose trousers"
198,TORTOISE-SHELL,Under all the eternal dome of mathematical law.
199,TORTOISE-SHELL,
200,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Fives, and tens,"
201,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Threes and fours and twelves,"
202,TORTOISE-SHELL,"All the volte face of decimals,"
203,TORTOISE-SHELL,"The whirligig of dozens and the pinnacle of seven,"
204,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Turn him on his back,"
205,TORTOISE-SHELL,"The kicking little beetle,"
206,TORTOISE-SHELL,"And there again, on his shell-tender, earth-touching"
207,TORTOISE-SHELL,"belly,"
208,TORTOISE-SHELL,"The long cleavage of division, upright of the"
209,TORTOISE-SHELL,eternal cross.
210,TORTOISE-SHELL,
211,TORTOISE-SHELL,"And on either side count five,"
212,TORTOISE-SHELL,"On each side, two above, on each side, two below"
213,TORTOISE-SHELL,The dark bar horizontal.
214,TORTOISE-SHELL,
215,TORTOISE-SHELL,"It goes right through him, the sprottling insect,"
216,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Through his cross-wise cloven psyche,"
217,TORTOISE-SHELL,Through his five-fold complex-nature.
218,TORTOISE-SHELL,
219,TORTOISE-SHELL,So turn him over on his toes again;
220,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Four pin-point toes, and a problematical thumb-"
221,TORTOISE-SHELL,"piece,"
222,TORTOISE-SHELL,
223,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Four rowing limbs, and one wedge-balancing-"
224,TORTOISE-SHELL,"head,"
225,TORTOISE-SHELL,
226,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Four and one makes five, which is the clue to all"
227,TORTOISE-SHELL,mathematics.
228,TORTOISE-SHELL,
229,TORTOISE-SHELL,The Lord wrote it all down on the little slate
230,TORTOISE-SHELL,Of the baby tortoise.
231,TORTOISE-SHELL,
232,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Outward and visible indication of the plan within,"
233,TORTOISE-SHELL,"The complex, manifold involvedness of an"
234,TORTOISE-SHELL,individual creature
235,TORTOISE-SHELL,Blotted out
236,TORTOISE-SHELL,"On this small bird, this rudiment,"
237,TORTOISE-SHELL,"This little dome, this pediment"
238,TORTOISE-SHELL,"Of all creation,"
239,TORTOISE-SHELL,This slow one.
240,TORTOISE-SHELL,
241,TORTOISE-SHELL,
242,TORTOISE-SHELL,
243,TORTOISE-SHELL,
244,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS
245,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
246,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
247,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"On he goes, the little one,"
248,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Bud of the universe,"
249,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Pediment of life.
250,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
251,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Setting off somewhere, apparently."
252,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Whither away, brisk egg?"
253,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
254,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,His mother deposited him on the soil as if he were
255,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"no more than droppings,"
256,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,And now he scuffles tinily past her as if she were
257,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,an old rusty tin.
258,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
259,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"A mere obstacle,"
260,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,He veers round the slow great mound of her.
261,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
262,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Tortoises always foresee obstacles.
263,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
264,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,It is no use my saying to him in an emotional
265,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,voice:
266,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"""This is your Mother, she laid you when you were"
267,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"an egg."""
268,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
269,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"He does not even trouble to answer:   ""Woman,"
270,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"what have I to do with thee?"""
271,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"He wearily looks the other way,"
272,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,And she even more wearily looks another way
273,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"still,"
274,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Each with the utmost apathy,"
275,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Incognizant,"
276,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Unaware,"
277,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Nothing.
278,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
279,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"As for papa,"
280,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"He snaps when I offer him his offspring,"
281,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Just as he snaps when I poke a bit of stick at him,"
282,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Because he is irascible this morning, an irascible"
283,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,tortoise
284,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Being touched with love, and devoid of"
285,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,fatherliness.
286,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
287,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Father and mother,"
288,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And three little brothers,"
289,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And all rambling aimless, like little perambulating"
290,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"pebbles scattered in the garden,"
291,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Not knowing each other from bits of earth or old
292,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,tins.
293,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
294,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Except that papa and mama are old acquaintances,"
295,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"of course,"
296,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"But family feeling there is none, not even the"
297,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,beginnings.
298,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
299,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Fatherless, motherless, brotherless, sisterless"
300,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Little tortoise.
301,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
302,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Row on then, small pebble,"
303,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Over the clods of the autumn, wind-chilled"
304,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"sunshine,"
305,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Young gayety.
306,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
307,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Does he look for a companion?
308,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"No, no, don't think it."
309,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,He doesn't know he is alone;
310,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Isolation is his birthright,"
311,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,This atom.
312,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
313,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To row forward, and reach himself tall on spiny"
314,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"toes,"
315,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To travel, to burrow into a little loose earth,"
316,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"afraid of the night,"
317,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To crop a little substance,"
318,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To move, and to be quite sure that he is moving:"
319,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Basta!
320,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
321,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,To be a tortoise!
322,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Think of it, in a garden of inert clods"
323,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"A brisk, brindled little tortoise, all to himself--"
324,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Croesus!
325,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
326,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,In a garden of pebbles and insects
327,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"To roam, and feel the slow heart beat"
328,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Tortoise-wise, the first bell sounding"
329,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"From   the   warm  blood,   in   the   dark-creation"
330,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,morning.
331,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
332,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Moving, and being himself,"
333,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"Slow, and unquestioned,"
334,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And inordinately there, O stoic!"
335,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Wandering in the slow triumph of his own
336,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"existence,"
337,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Ringing the soundless bell of his presence in
338,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"chaos,"
339,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,"And biting the frail grass arrogantly,"
340,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,Decidedly arrogantly.
341,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
342,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
343,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
344,TORTOISE FAMILY CONNECTIONS,
345,LUI ET ELLE,LUI ET ELLE
346,LUI ET ELLE,
347,LUI ET ELLE,
348,LUI ET ELLE,She is large and matronly
349,LUI ET ELLE,"And rather dirty,"
350,LUI ET ELLE,"A little sardonic-looking, as if domesticity had"
351,LUI ET ELLE,driven her to it.
352,LUI ET ELLE,
353,LUI ET ELLE,"Though what she does, except lay four eggs at"
354,LUI ET ELLE,random in the garden once a year
355,LUI ET ELLE,"And put up with her husband,"
356,LUI ET ELLE,I don't know.
357,LUI ET ELLE,
358,LUI ET ELLE,She likes to eat.
359,LUI ET ELLE,
360,LUI ET ELLE,"She hurries up, striding reared on long uncanny"
361,LUI ET ELLE,"legs,"
362,LUI ET ELLE,When food is going.
363,LUI ET ELLE,"Oh yes, she can make haste when she likes."
364,LUI ET ELLE,
365,LUI ET ELLE,She snaps the soft bread from my hand in great
366,LUI ET ELLE,"mouthfuls,"
367,LUI ET ELLE,"Opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron,"
368,LUI ET ELLE,pristine face
369,LUI ET ELLE,Into an enormously wide-beaked mouth
370,LUI ET ELLE,"Like sudden curved scissors,"
371,LUI ET ELLE,"And gulping at more than she can swallow, and"
372,LUI ET ELLE,"working her thick, soft tongue,"
373,LUI ET ELLE,And having the bread hanging over her chin.
374,LUI ET ELLE,
375,LUI ET ELLE,"O Mistress, Mistress,"
376,LUI ET ELLE,"Reptile mistress,"
377,LUI ET ELLE,"Your eye is very dark, very bright,"
378,LUI ET ELLE,And it never softens
379,LUI ET ELLE,Although you watch.
380,LUI ET ELLE,
381,LUI ET ELLE,"She knows,"
382,LUI ET ELLE,"She knows well enough to come for food,"
383,LUI ET ELLE,Yet she sees me not;
384,LUI ET ELLE,"Her bright eye sees, but not me, not anything,"
385,LUI ET ELLE,"Sightful, sightless, seeing and visionless,"
386,LUI ET ELLE,Reptile mistress.
387,LUI ET ELLE,
388,LUI ET ELLE,"Taking bread in her curved, gaping, toothless"
389,LUI ET ELLE,"mouth,"
390,LUI ET ELLE,She has no qualm when she catches my finger in
391,LUI ET ELLE,"her steel overlapping gums,"
392,LUI ET ELLE,"But she hangs on, and my shout and my shrinking"
393,LUI ET ELLE,"are nothing to her,"
394,LUI ET ELLE,She does not even know she is nipping me with
395,LUI ET ELLE,her curved beak.
396,LUI ET ELLE,"Snake-like she draws at my finger, while I drag"
397,LUI ET ELLE,it in horror away.
398,LUI ET ELLE,
399,LUI ET ELLE,"Mistress, reptile mistress,"
400,LUI ET ELLE,"You are almost too large, I am almost frightened."
401,LUI ET ELLE,"He is much smaller,"
402,LUI ET ELLE,"Dapper beside her,"
403,LUI ET ELLE,And ridiculously small.
404,LUI ET ELLE,
405,LUI ET ELLE,"Her laconic eye has an earthy, materialistic look,"
406,LUI ET ELLE,"His, poor darling, is almost fiery."
407,LUI ET ELLE,
408,LUI ET ELLE,"His wimple, his blunt-prowed face,"
409,LUI ET ELLE,"His low forehead, his skinny neck, his long,"
410,LUI ET ELLE,"scaled, striving legs,"
411,LUI ET ELLE,"So striving, striving,"
412,LUI ET ELLE,"Are all more delicate than she,"
413,LUI ET ELLE,And he has a cruel scar on his shell.
414,LUI ET ELLE,
415,LUI ET ELLE,"Poor darling, biting at her feet,"
416,LUI ET ELLE,"Running beside her like a dog, biting her earthy,"
417,LUI ET ELLE,"splay feet,"
418,LUI ET ELLE,"Nipping her ankles,"
419,LUI ET ELLE,"Which she drags apathetic away, though without"
420,LUI ET ELLE,retreating into her shell.
421,LUI ET ELLE,
422,LUI ET ELLE,"Agelessly silent,"
423,LUI ET ELLE,"And with a grim, reptile determination,"
424,LUI ET ELLE,"Cold,  voiceless  age-after-age  behind him,"
425,LUI ET ELLE,serpents' long obstinacy
426,LUI ET ELLE,Of horizontal persistence.
427,LUI ET ELLE,
428,LUI ET ELLE,Little old man
429,LUI ET ELLE,"Scuffling beside her, bending down, catching his"
430,LUI ET ELLE,"opportunity,"
431,LUI ET ELLE,"Parting his steel-trap face, so suddenly, and"
432,LUI ET ELLE,"seizing her scaly ankle,"
433,LUI ET ELLE,"And hanging grimly on,"
434,LUI ET ELLE,"Letting go at last as she drags away,"
435,LUI ET ELLE,And closing his steel-trap face.
436,LUI ET ELLE,
437,LUI ET ELLE,"His steel-trap, stoic, ageless, handsome face."
438,LUI ET ELLE,"Alas, what a fool he looks in this scuffle."
439,LUI ET ELLE,
440,LUI ET ELLE,And how he feels it!
441,LUI ET ELLE,
442,LUI ET ELLE,"The lonely rambler, the stoic, dignified stalker"
443,LUI ET ELLE,"through chaos,"
444,LUI ET ELLE,"The immune, the animate,"
445,LUI ET ELLE,"Enveloped in isolation,"
446,LUI ET ELLE,Forerunner.
447,LUI ET ELLE,Now look at him!
448,LUI ET ELLE,
449,LUI ET ELLE,"Alas, the spear is through the side of his isolation."
450,LUI ET ELLE,"His adolescence saw him crucified into sex,"
451,LUI ET ELLE,"Doomed, in the long crucifixion of desire, to seek"
452,LUI ET ELLE,his consummation beyond himself.
453,LUI ET ELLE,"Divided into passionate duality,"
454,LUI ET ELLE,"He, so finished and immune, now broken into"
455,LUI ET ELLE,"desirous fragmentariness,"
456,LUI ET ELLE,Doomed to make an intolerable fool of himself
457,LUI ET ELLE,In his effort toward completion again.
458,LUI ET ELLE,
459,LUI ET ELLE,"Poor little earthy house-inhabiting Osiris,"
460,LUI ET ELLE,The mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into

464,LUI ET ELLE,
465,LUI ET ELLE,And so behold him following the tail
466,LUI ET ELLE,"Of that mud-hovel of his slowly-rambling spouse,"
467,LUI ET ELLE,"Like some unhappy bull at the tail of a cow,"
468,LUI ET ELLE,"But with more than bovine, grim,  earth-dank"
469,LUI ET ELLE,"persistence,"
470,LUI ET ELLE,Suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as she stretches
471,LUI ET ELLE,"out to walk,"
472,LUI ET ELLE,"Roaming over the sods,"
473,LUI ET ELLE,"Or, if it happen to show, at her pointed, heavy tail"
474,LUI ET ELLE,Beneath the low-dropping back-board of her shell.
475,LUI ET ELLE,
476,LUI ET ELLE,"Their two shells like doomed boats bumping,"
477,LUI ET ELLE,"Hers huge, his small;"
478,LUI ET ELLE,Their   splay   feet   rambling   and   rowing   like
479,LUI ET ELLE,"paddles,"
480,LUI ET ELLE,"And stumbling mixed up in one another,"
481,LUI ET ELLE,In the race of love--
482,LUI ET ELLE,"Two tortoises,"
483,LUI ET ELLE,"She huge, he small."
484,LUI ET ELLE,
485,LUI ET ELLE,"She seems earthily apathetic,"
486,LUI ET ELLE,And he has a reptile's awful persistence.
487,LUI ET ELLE,
488,LUI ET ELLE,"I heard a woman pitying her, pitying the Mère"
489,LUI ET ELLE,Tortue.
490,LUI ET ELLE,"While I, I pity Monsieur."
491,LUI ET ELLE,"""He pesters her and torments her,"" said the"

493,LUI ET ELLE,"How much more is _he_ pestered and tormented,"
494,LUI ET ELLE,say I.
495,LUI ET ELLE,
496,LUI ET ELLE,What can he do?
497,LUI ET ELLE,"He is dumb, he is visionless,"
498,LUI ET ELLE,Conceptionless.
499,LUI ET ELLE,
500,LUI ET ELLE,"His black, sad-lidded eye sees but beholds not"
501,LUI ET ELLE,"As her earthen mound moves on,"
502,LUI ET ELLE,"But he catches the folds of vulnerable, leathery"
503,LUI ET ELLE,"skin,"
504,LUI ET ELLE,"Nail-studded, that shake beneath her shell,"
505,LUI ET ELLE,"And drags at these with his beak,"
506,LUI ET ELLE,"Drags and drags and bites,"
507,LUI ET ELLE,"While she pulls herself free, and rows her dull"
508,LUI ET ELLE,mound along.

518,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank."
519,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
520,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
521,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,That work beneath her while she sprawls along
522,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"In her ungainly pace,"
523,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Her folds of skin that work and row
524,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Beneath  the   earth-soiled  hovel  in  which  she
525,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,moves.
526,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
527,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,And so he strains beneath her housey walls
528,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
529,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Suddenly, or her skinny limb,"
530,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,And strange and grimly drags at her
531,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Like a dog,"

533,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,persistency.
534,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
535,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed."
536,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
537,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"And doomed to partiality, partial being,"
538,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Ache, and want of being,"
539,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Want,"
540,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add"

547,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"This awkward, harrowing pursuit,"
548,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,This grim necessity from within.
549,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
550,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Does she know
551,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,As she moves eternally slowly away?
552,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird"

554,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,All knowledgeless?
555,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
556,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"The awful concussion,"

560,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"singleness and oneness,"
561,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,"
562,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Driven away from himself into her tracks,"
563,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,Forced to crash against her.
564,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,
565,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,"
566,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Little gentleman,"
567,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,"Sorry plight,"
568,TORTOISE GALLANTRY,We ought to look the other way.

583,TORTOISE SHOUT,"First faint scream,"

597,TORTOISE SHOUT,
598,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A far, was-it-audible scream,"
599,TORTOISE SHOUT,Or did it sound on the plasm direct?
600,TORTOISE SHOUT,
601,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Worse than the cry of the new-born,"
602,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A scream,"
603,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A yell,"
604,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A shout,"
605,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A pæan,"
606,TORTOISE SHOUT,"A death-agony,"

614,TORTOISE SHOUT,Why was the veil torn?
615,TORTOISE SHOUT,
616,TORTOISE SHOUT,The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?
617,TORTOISE SHOUT,The male soul's membrane
618,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Torn with a shriek half music, half horror."

631,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Reaching  and gripping  tense,  more  reaching"
632,TORTOISE SHOUT,anguish in uttermost tension
633,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping"

635,TORTOISE SHOUT,Opening its clenched face from his outstretched
636,TORTOISE SHOUT,neck
637,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And giving that fragile yell, that scream,"

639,TORTOISE SHOUT,"From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,"

659,TORTOISE SHOUT,
660,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember, when I was a boy,"
661,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught"

663,TORTOISE SHOUT,snake;
664,TORTOISE SHOUT,I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break

666,TORTOISE SHOUT,I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat
667,TORTOISE SHOUT,of night
668,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;"
669,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember the first time, out of a bush in the"
670,TORTOISE SHOUT,"darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and"
671,TORTOISE SHOUT,gurgles startled the depths of my soul;
672,TORTOISE SHOUT,I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went
673,TORTOISE SHOUT,through a wood at midnight;
674,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and"
675,TORTOISE SHOUT,"blorting through the hours, persistent and"
676,TORTOISE SHOUT,irrepressible;
677,TORTOISE SHOUT,I remember my first terror hearing the howl of
678,TORTOISE SHOUT,"weird, amorous cats;"
679,TORTOISE SHOUT,"I remember the scream of a terrified, injured"
680,TORTOISE SHOUT,"horse, the sheet-lightning"
681,TORTOISE SHOUT,And running away from the sound of a woman in
682,TORTOISE SHOUT,"labor, something like an owl whooing,"
683,TORTOISE SHOUT,And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a
684,TORTOISE SHOUT,"lamb,"
685,TORTOISE SHOUT,"The first wail of an infant,"
686,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And my mother singing to herself,"
687,TORTOISE SHOUT,And the first tenor singing of the passionate
688,TORTOISE SHOUT,"throat of a young collier, who has long since"
689,TORTOISE SHOUT,"drunk himself to death,"
690,TORTOISE SHOUT,The first elements of foreign speech

694,TORTOISE SHOUT,"And less than all these,"
695,TORTOISE SHOUT,"This last,"
696,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Strange, faint coition yell"
697,TORTOISE SHOUT,"Of the male tortoise at extremity,"
698,TORTOISE SHOUT,Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest
