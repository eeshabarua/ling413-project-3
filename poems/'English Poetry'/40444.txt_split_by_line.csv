45,PREFACE.,"As the mind of man is ever fond of variety, nothing seems better"
46,PREFACE.,"calculated to entertain, than a judicious collection of the smaller,"
47,PREFACE.,"though not on that account less laboured, productions of eminent poets:"
48,PREFACE.,"an entertainment, not unlike that which we receive from surveying a"
49,PREFACE.,"finished landschape, or well disposed piece of shell-work: where each"
50,PREFACE.,"particular object, tho' singly beautiful, and sufficiently striking by"
51,PREFACE.,"itself, receives an additional charm, thus, as Milton expresses it,"
52,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.
53,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,
54,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"The first miscellaneous collection of poems, that ever appeared in"
55,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"Great-Britain with any reputation, is that published by Dryden: which"
56,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,was afterwards continued by Tonson. There are many pieces of the highest
57,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"merit in this collection, by Dryden, Denham, Creech, Drayton, Garth,"
58,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"Marvell, and many others; yet the compilers, it is evident, were not"
59,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"always sufficiently scrupulous and cautious in their choice, as several"
60,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"pieces are admitted, among the rest, which would otherwise utterly have"
61,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"perished, and which had no other recommendation, than that they served"
62,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"to swell the volume. Since this, many miscellanies have been published"
63,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,both in Scotland and England: to enumerate which would be no less
64,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"tedious than useless. It will be sufficient to remark, that through want"
65,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"of care or judgment in their respective editors, they are all forgotten"
66,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,or neglected. From these the miscellany known by the name of Mr. Pope
67,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"perhaps ought to be excepted; tho' that, indeed, cannot properly be"
68,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"styled a collection of poems by different hands, which is such a one as"
69,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"we are speaking of at present, the greater part consisting of pieces by"
70,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"Mr. Pope only. The best miscellany at this day extant in our language,"
71,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"and the first complete one of the kind which we have seen, is that"
72,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"lately published by R. Dodsley, which boasts the greatest names of the"
73,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,present age among its contributors.
74,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,
75,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"As to the poetical collection here exhibited to the public, we apprehend"
76,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"it challenges no small degree of regard, as it was made under the"
77,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"immediate inspection and conduct of several very ingenious gentlemen,"
78,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,whose names it would do us the highest honour to mention; and as it
79,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,contains a variety not to be found even in the admirable collection last
80,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,spoken of; I mean the Intermixture of poems both Scotch and English. Nor
81,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,is this variety less agreeable than useful; as from it we have an
82,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,opportunity of forming a comparison and estimate of the taste and genius
83,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"of the two different nations, in their poetical compositions."
84,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,
85,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"It will be necessary to take notice, that our chief care has been to"
86,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"furnish out the following miscellany with those pieces, regard being"
87,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"first had to real merit, which have laid unknown and unobserved from"
88,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,their MANNER of publication; several of them having been printed by
89,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"themselves, and so perished as it were for want of bulk, and others lost"
90,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"amid the rubbish of collections injudiciously made, and perhaps not"
91,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"easily to be met with. Nor will it be improper to mention, that in order"
92,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"to render our volume still more compleat, we have had the favour of some"
93,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"original poems, written by a late member of the university of Aberdeen,"
94,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,whose modesty would not permit us to prefix his name: one of which in
95,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"this edition is printed with many improvements, from a corrected copy."
96,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"And from these ingenious essays, the public may be enabled to form some"
97,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"judgment beforehand of a poem of a nobler and more important nature,"
98,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,which he is now preparing. Nor must we forget to return our public
99,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"thanks to this gentleman, for the service he has been to us, not only in"
100,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"making this collection more excellent by his own contributions, but in"
101,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,selecting such pieces of others as were suitable to our design.
102,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,
103,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,It is hoped that the ancient Scottish poems (amongst which THE THISTLE
104,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"AND THE ROSE, and HARDYKNUTE are more particularly distinguished) will"
105,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,make no disagreeable figure amongst those of modern date; and that they
106,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"will produce the same effect here, as Mr. Pope observes a moderate use"
107,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"of old words may have in a poem; which, adds he, is like working old"
108,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"abbey-stones into a modern building, and which I have sometimes seen"
109,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,practised with good success.
110,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,
111,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"Upon the whole, as we have been favoured with the best assistance in"
112,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"compiling this volume, no further apology is necessary; and as the"
113,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,approbation of the public has been already secured to these poems
114,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,"separately, we hope they have no less reason to claim it, when thus"
115,SWEETLY INTERCHANGED.,published together.
