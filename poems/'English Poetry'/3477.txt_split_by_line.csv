136,PART I. INDOORS,
137,PART I. INDOORS,Some day of days! Some dawning
138,PART I. INDOORS,yet to be
139,PART I. INDOORS,I shall be clothed with immortality!
140,PART I. INDOORS,
141,PART I. INDOORS,"And, in that day, I shall not greatly care"
142,PART I. INDOORS,That Jane spilt candle grease upon the
143,PART I. INDOORS,stair.
144,PART I. INDOORS,
145,PART I. INDOORS,"It will not grieve me then, as once it did,"
146,PART I. INDOORS,That careless hands have chipped my
147,PART I. INDOORS,teapot lid.
148,PART I. INDOORS,
149,PART I. INDOORS,"I groan, being burdened. But, in that"
150,PART I. INDOORS,"glad day,"
151,PART I. INDOORS,I shall forget vexations of the way.
152,PART I. INDOORS,
153,PART I. INDOORS,"That needs were often great, when means"
154,PART I. INDOORS,"were small,"
155,PART I. INDOORS,Will not perplex me any more at all
156,PART I. INDOORS,"A few short years at most (it may be less),"
157,PART I. INDOORS,I shall have done with earthly storm and
158,PART I. INDOORS,stress.
159,PART I. INDOORS,
160,PART I. INDOORS,"So, for this day, I lay me at Thy feet."

168,PART I. INDOORS,Within my House
169,PART I. INDOORS,
170,PART I. INDOORS,"First, there's the entrance, narrow,"
171,PART I. INDOORS,"and so small,"
172,PART I. INDOORS,The hat-stand seems to fill the tiny hall;
173,PART I. INDOORS,"That staircase, too, has such an awkward"
174,PART I. INDOORS,"bend,"
175,PART I. INDOORS,"The carpet rucks, and rises up on end!"
176,PART I. INDOORS,"Then, all the rooms are cramped and close"
177,PART I. INDOORS,together;
178,PART I. INDOORS,And there's a musty smell in rainy weather.
179,PART I. INDOORS,"Yes, and it makes the daily work go hard"
180,PART I. INDOORS,To have the only tap across a yard.
181,PART I. INDOORS,"These creaking doors, these draughts, this"
182,PART I. INDOORS,"battered paint,"
183,PART I. INDOORS,"Would try, I think, the temper of a saint,"
184,PART I. INDOORS,
185,PART I. INDOORS,How often had I railed against these
186,PART I. INDOORS,"things,"
187,PART I. INDOORS,"With envies, and with bitter murmurings"
188,PART I. INDOORS,"For spacious rooms, and sunny garden"
189,PART I. INDOORS,plots!
190,PART I. INDOORS,"Until one day,"
191,PART I. INDOORS,"Washing the breakfast dishes, so I think,"
192,PART I. INDOORS,I paused a moment in my work to pray;
193,PART I. INDOORS,And then and there
194,PART I. INDOORS,All life seemed suddenly made new and
195,PART I. INDOORS,fair;
196,PART I. INDOORS,"For, like the Psalmist's dove among the"
197,PART I. INDOORS,pots
198,PART I. INDOORS,"(Those endless pots, that filled the tiny"
199,PART I. INDOORS,"sink!),"
200,PART I. INDOORS,My spirit found her wings.
201,PART I. INDOORS,
202,PART I. INDOORS,"""Lord"" (thus I prayed), ""it matters not"
203,PART I. INDOORS,at all
204,PART I. INDOORS,That my poor home is ill-arranged and
205,PART I. INDOORS,small:
206,PART I. INDOORS,"I, not the house, am straitened; Lord,"
207,PART I. INDOORS,'tis I!
208,PART I. INDOORS,"Enlarge my foolish heart, that by-and-by"
209,PART I. INDOORS,I may look up with such a radiant face
210,PART I. INDOORS,Thou shalt have glory even in this place.
211,PART I. INDOORS,"And when I trip, or stumble unawares"
212,PART I. INDOORS,"In carrying water up these awkward stairs,"
213,PART I. INDOORS,"Then keep me sweet, and teach me day"
214,PART I. INDOORS,by day
215,PART I. INDOORS,To tread with patience Thy appointed
216,PART I. INDOORS,way.
217,PART I. INDOORS,"As for the house . . . . Lord, let it be"
218,PART I. INDOORS,my part
219,PART I. INDOORS,"To walk within it with a perfect heart."""

226,PART I. INDOORS,
227,PART I. INDOORS,"See, I am cumbered, Lord,"
228,PART I. INDOORS,"With serving, and with small vexa-"
229,PART I. INDOORS,tious things.
230,PART I. INDOORS,"Upstairs, and down, my feet"
231,PART I. INDOORS,"Must hasten, sure and fleet."
232,PART I. INDOORS,So weary that I cannot heed Thy word;
233,PART I. INDOORS,"So tired, I cannot now mount up with"
234,PART I. INDOORS,wings.
235,PART I. INDOORS,I wrestle--how I wrestle!--through the
236,PART I. INDOORS,hours.
237,PART I. INDOORS,"Nay, not with principalities, nor powers--"
238,PART I. INDOORS,Dark spiritual foes of God's and man's--
239,PART I. INDOORS,But with antagonistic pots and pans:
240,PART I. INDOORS,"With footmarks in the hall,"
241,PART I. INDOORS,"With smears upon the wall,"
242,PART I. INDOORS,"With doubtful ears, and small unwashen"
243,PART I. INDOORS,"hands,"
244,PART I. INDOORS,And with a babe's innumerable demands.
245,PART I. INDOORS,
246,PART I. INDOORS,"I toil with feverish haste, while tear-drops"
247,PART I. INDOORS,"glisten,"
248,PART I. INDOORS,
249,PART I. INDOORS,"(O, child of mine, be still. And listen--"
250,PART I. INDOORS,listen!)
251,PART I. INDOORS,
252,PART I. INDOORS,"At last, I laid aside"
253,PART I. INDOORS,"Important work, no other hands could do"
254,PART I. INDOORS,"So well (I thought), no skill contrive so"
255,PART I. INDOORS,true.
256,PART I. INDOORS,And with my heart's door open--open
257,PART I. INDOORS,wide--
258,PART I. INDOORS,"With leisured feet, and idle hands, I sat."
259,PART I. INDOORS,"I, foolish, fussy, blind as any bat,"
260,PART I. INDOORS,"Sat down to listen, and to learn. And lo,"
261,PART I. INDOORS,My thousand tasks were done the better so.

264,PART I. INDOORS,
265,PART I. INDOORS,
266,PART I. INDOORS,
267,PART I. INDOORS,To Mother
268,PART I. INDOORS,
269,PART I. INDOORS,"I would that you should know,"
270,PART I. INDOORS,"Dear mother, that I love you--love"
271,PART I. INDOORS,you so!
272,PART I. INDOORS,That I remember other days and years;
273,PART I. INDOORS,Remember childish joys and childish fears.
274,PART I. INDOORS,"And this, because my baby's little hand"
275,PART I. INDOORS,Opened my own heart's door and made
276,PART I. INDOORS,me understand.
277,PART I. INDOORS,
278,PART I. INDOORS,I wonder how you could
279,PART I. INDOORS,Be always kind and good!
280,PART I. INDOORS,So quick to hear; to tend
281,PART I. INDOORS,My smallest ills; to lend
282,PART I. INDOORS,Such sympathising ears
283,PART I. INDOORS,Swifter than ancient seer's.
284,PART I. INDOORS,"I never yet knew hands so soft and kind,"
285,PART I. INDOORS,"Nor any cheek so smooth, nor any mind"
286,PART I. INDOORS,So full of tender thoughts. . . . Dear
287,PART I. INDOORS,"mother, now"
288,PART I. INDOORS,I think that I can guess a little how
289,PART I. INDOORS,"You must have looked for some response,"
290,PART I. INDOORS,"some sign,"
291,PART I. INDOORS,That all my tiresome wayward heart was
292,PART I. INDOORS,thine.
293,PART I. INDOORS,
294,PART I. INDOORS,And sure it was! You were my first dear
295,PART I. INDOORS,love!
296,PART I. INDOORS,You who first pointed me to God above;
297,PART I. INDOORS,You who seemed hearkening to my lightest
298,PART I. INDOORS,"word,"
299,PART I. INDOORS,And in the dark night seasons always
300,PART I. INDOORS,heard
301,PART I. INDOORS,"When I came trembling, knocking at your"
302,PART I. INDOORS,door.
303,PART I. INDOORS,"Forgive me, mother, if my whims outwore"
304,PART I. INDOORS,Your patient heart. Or if in later days
305,PART I. INDOORS,I sought out foolish unfamiliar ways;
306,PART I. INDOORS,"If ever, mother dear, I loosed my hold"
307,PART I. INDOORS,"Of your loved hand; or, headstrong,"
308,PART I. INDOORS,"thought you cold,"
309,PART I. INDOORS,"Forgive me, mother! Oh, forgive me,"
310,PART I. INDOORS,dear!
311,PART I. INDOORS,I am come back at last--you see me
312,PART I. INDOORS,"here,"
313,PART I. INDOORS,"Your loving child. . . . And, mother,"
314,PART I. INDOORS,on my knee
315,PART I. INDOORS,I pray that thus my child may think of
316,PART I. INDOORS,me!

319,PART I. INDOORS,
320,PART I. INDOORS,
321,PART I. INDOORS,
322,PART I. INDOORS,In Such an Hour
323,PART I. INDOORS,
324,PART I. INDOORS,"Sometimes, when everything goes"
325,PART I. INDOORS,wrong:
326,PART I. INDOORS,"When days are short, and nights are long;"
327,PART I. INDOORS,When wash-day brings so dull a sky
328,PART I. INDOORS,That not a single thing will dry.
329,PART I. INDOORS,"And when the kitchen chimney smokes,"
330,PART I. INDOORS,"And when there's naught so ""queer"" as"
331,PART I. INDOORS,folks!
332,PART I. INDOORS,"When friends deplore my faded youth,"
333,PART I. INDOORS,And when the baby cuts a tooth.
334,PART I. INDOORS,"While John, the baby last but one,"
335,PART I. INDOORS,Clings round my skirts till day is done;
336,PART I. INDOORS,"When fat, good-tempered Jane is glum,"
337,PART I. INDOORS,And butcher's man forgets to come.
338,PART I. INDOORS,
339,PART I. INDOORS,"Sometimes, I say, on days like these,"
340,PART I. INDOORS,I get a sudden gleam of bliss.
341,PART I. INDOORS,"""Not on some sunny day of ease,"
342,PART I. INDOORS,"He'll come . . but on a day like this!"""
343,PART I. INDOORS,"And, in the twinkling of an eye,"
344,PART I. INDOORS,These tiresome things will all go by!
345,PART I. INDOORS,
346,PART I. INDOORS,"And, 'tis a curious thing, but Jane"
347,PART I. INDOORS,"Is sure, just then, to smile again;"
348,PART I. INDOORS,"Or, out the truant sun will peep,"
349,PART I. INDOORS,And both the babies fall asleep.
350,PART I. INDOORS,"The fire burns up with roar sublime,"
351,PART I. INDOORS,And butcher's man is just in time.
352,PART I. INDOORS,And oh! My feeble faith grows strong
353,PART I. INDOORS,"Sometimes, when everything goes wrong!"

359,PART I. INDOORS,The Daily Interview
360,PART I. INDOORS,
361,PART I. INDOORS,Such a sensation Sunday's preacher
362,PART I. INDOORS,made.
363,PART I. INDOORS,"""Christian!"" he cried, ""what is your stock-"
364,PART I. INDOORS,in-trade?
365,PART I. INDOORS,Alas! Too often nil. No time to pray;
366,PART I. INDOORS,"No interview with Christ from day to day,"
367,PART I. INDOORS,"A hurried prayer, maybe, just gabbled"
368,PART I. INDOORS,through;
369,PART I. INDOORS,"A random text--for any one will do."""
370,PART I. INDOORS,"Then gently, lovingly, with look intense,"
371,PART I. INDOORS,He leaned towards us--
372,PART I. INDOORS,"""Is this common sense?"
373,PART I. INDOORS,No person in his rightful mind will try
374,PART I. INDOORS,"To run his business so, lest by-and-by"
375,PART I. INDOORS,"The thing collapses, smirching his good"
376,PART I. INDOORS,"name,"
377,PART I. INDOORS,"And he, insolvent, face the world with"
378,PART I. INDOORS,"shame."""
379,PART I. INDOORS,
380,PART I. INDOORS,I heard it all; and something inly said
381,PART I. INDOORS,That all was true. The daily toil and press
382,PART I. INDOORS,Had crowded out my hopes of holiness.
383,PART I. INDOORS,"Still, my old self rose, reasoning:"
384,PART I. INDOORS,"How can you,"
385,PART I. INDOORS,With strenuous work to do--
386,PART I. INDOORS,"Real slogging work--say, how can you"
387,PART I. INDOORS,keep pace
388,PART I. INDOORS,"With leisured folks? Why, you could"
389,PART I. INDOORS,grow in grace
390,PART I. INDOORS,If you had time . . . the daily Interview
391,PART I. INDOORS,Was never meant for those who wash and
392,PART I. INDOORS,bake.
393,PART I. INDOORS,
394,PART I. INDOORS,But yet a small Voice whispered:
395,PART I. INDOORS,"""For My sake"
396,PART I. INDOORS,Keep tryst with Me!
397,PART I. INDOORS,"There are so many minutes in a day,"
398,PART I. INDOORS,So spare Me ten.
399,PART I. INDOORS,"It shall be proven, then,"
400,PART I. INDOORS,Ten minutes set apart can well repay
401,PART I. INDOORS,You shall accomplish more
402,PART I. INDOORS,If you will shut your door
403,PART I. INDOORS,For ten short minutes just to watch and
404,PART I. INDOORS,"pray."""
405,PART I. INDOORS,
406,PART I. INDOORS,"""Lord, if I do"
407,PART I. INDOORS,"Set ten apart for You"""
408,PART I. INDOORS,"(I dared, yes dared, to reason thus with"
409,PART I. INDOORS,Him)
410,PART I. INDOORS,"""The baker's sure to come;"
411,PART I. INDOORS,Or Jane will call
412,PART I. INDOORS,To say some visitor is in the hall;
413,PART I. INDOORS,"Or I shall smell the porridge burning, yes,"
414,PART I. INDOORS,And run to stop it in my hastiness.
415,PART I. INDOORS,"There's not ten minutes, Lord, in all the"
416,PART I. INDOORS,day
417,PART I. INDOORS,I can be sure of peace in which to watch
418,PART I. INDOORS,"and pray."""
419,PART I. INDOORS,
420,PART I. INDOORS,"But all that night,"
421,PART I. INDOORS,"With calm insistent might,"
422,PART I. INDOORS,"That gentle Voice spake softly, lovingly--"
423,PART I. INDOORS,"""Keep tryst with Me!"
424,PART I. INDOORS,You have devised a dozen different ways
425,PART I. INDOORS,Of getting easy meals on washing days;
426,PART I. INDOORS,You spend much anxious thought on
427,PART I. INDOORS,hopeless socks;
428,PART I. INDOORS,On moving ironmould from tiny frocks;
429,PART I. INDOORS,'Twas you who found
430,PART I. INDOORS,A way to make the sugar lumps go round;
431,PART I. INDOORS,"You, who invented ways and means of"
432,PART I. INDOORS,making
433,PART I. INDOORS,"Nice spicy buns for tea, hot from the baking,"
434,PART I. INDOORS,When margarine was short . . . and can-
435,PART I. INDOORS,not you
436,PART I. INDOORS,Who made the time to join the butter queue
437,PART I. INDOORS,Make time again for Me?
438,PART I. INDOORS,"Yes, will you not, with all your daily"
439,PART I. INDOORS,"striving,"
440,PART I. INDOORS,Use woman's wit in scheming and con-
441,PART I. INDOORS,triving
442,PART I. INDOORS,"To keep that tryst with Me?"""
443,PART I. INDOORS,
444,PART I. INDOORS,Like ice long bound
445,PART I. INDOORS,"On powdered frosty ground,"
446,PART I. INDOORS,My erring will all suddenly gave way.
447,PART I. INDOORS,The kind soft wind of His sweet pleading
448,PART I. INDOORS,"blew,"
449,PART I. INDOORS,"And swiftly, silently, before I knew,"
450,PART I. INDOORS,The warm love loosed and ran.
451,PART I. INDOORS,"Life-giving floods began,"
452,PART I. INDOORS,And so most lovingly I answered Him:
453,PART I. INDOORS,"""Lord, yes, I will, and can."

628,ENVOY.,"And Jane's hands are so full, she'll never"

630,ENVOY.,And I'm quite sure the clean clothes won't
631,ENVOY.,be aired--
632,ENVOY.,"At least, not properly."

641,ENVOY.,"You are so weary, child, you are so weak."

643,ENVOY.,The darkness and the doubt;
644,ENVOY.,This torturing fear that tosses you about.
645,ENVOY.,

647,ENVOY.,And out of shortened lives I build the
648,ENVOY.,ages. . . .

650,ENVOY.,"But, Lord, while such high things Thy"

656,ENVOY.,Pass over my affairs as things of nought.
657,ENVOY.,There are so many houses just like mine.
658,ENVOY.,"And I so earth-bound, and Thyself Divine."
659,ENVOY.,It seems impossible that Thou shouldst
660,ENVOY.,care
661,ENVOY.,Just what my babies wear;
662,ENVOY.,And what John gets to eat; . . . and
663,ENVOY.,can it be
664,ENVOY.,A circumstance of great concern to Thee
665,ENVOY.,Whether I live or die?
666,ENVOY.,
667,ENVOY.,"Have you forgotten then, My child, that I,"
668,ENVOY.,"The Infinite, the Limitless, laid down"
669,ENVOY.,"The method of existence that I knew,"
670,ENVOY.,And took on Me a nature just like you?
671,ENVOY.,I laboured day by day
672,ENVOY.,In the same dogged way
673,ENVOY.,That you have tackled household tasks.
674,ENVOY.,"And then,"
675,ENVOY.,"Remember, child, remember once again"
676,ENVOY.,Your own beloveds . . . did you really
677,ENVOY.,think--
678,ENVOY.,(Those days you toiled to get their meat

681,ENVOY.,stand
682,ENVOY.,Their little ailments)--did you think your
683,ENVOY.,"hand,"
684,ENVOY.,"Your feeble hand, was keeping them from ill?"
685,ENVOY.,"I gave them life, and life is more than meat;"
686,ENVOY.,"Those little limbs, so comely and so sweet."
687,ENVOY.,"You can make raiment for them, and are glad,"
688,ENVOY.,But can you add
689,ENVOY.,One cubit to their stature? Yet they grow!
690,ENVOY.,"Oh, child, hands off! Hands off! And"
691,ENVOY.,leave them so.
692,ENVOY.,"I guarded hitherto, I guard them still."
693,ENVOY.,
694,ENVOY.,I have let go at last. I have let go.
695,ENVOY.,"And, oh, the rest it is, dear God, to know"
696,ENVOY.,"My dear ones are so safe, for Thou wilt"

1483,ENVOY.,"And while she made the beds, I found"

1488,ENVOY.,"I crawled along the kitchen floor,"

1492,ENVOY.,
1493,ENVOY.,"Oh, this HAS been a naughty day!"
