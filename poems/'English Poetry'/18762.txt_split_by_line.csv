66,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which"

190,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_
191,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,
192,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,
193,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,Byron was a rapid as well as a voluminous writer. His _Tales_ were
194,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"thrown off at lightning speed, and even his dramas were thought out and"
195,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,worked through with unhesitating energy and rapid achievement.
196,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Nevertheless, the composition of his two great poems was all but"
197,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,coextensive with his poetical life. He began the first canto of _Childe
198,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Harold_ in the autumn of 1809, and he did not complete the fourth canto"
199,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,till the spring of 1818. He began the first canto of _Don Juan_ in the
200,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"autumn of 1818, and he was still at work on a seventeenth canto in the"
201,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"spring of 1823. Both poems were issued in parts, and with long intervals"
202,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,of unequal duration between the parts; but the same result was brought
203,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,about by different causes and produced a dissimilar effect. _Childe
204,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,Harold_ consists of three distinct poems descriptive of three successive
205,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,travels or journeys in foreign lands. The adventures of the hero are but
206,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,the pretext for the shifting of the diorama; whereas in _Don Juan_ the
207,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"story is continuous, and the scenery is exhibited as a background for"
208,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,the dramatic evolution of the personality of the hero. _Childe Harold_
209,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"came out at intervals, because there were periods when the author was"
210,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,stationary; but the interruptions in the composition and publication of
211,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"_Don Juan_ were due to the disapproval and discouragement of friends,"
212,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,and the very natural hesitation and procrastination of the publisher.
213,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Canto I. was written in September, 1818; Canto II. in December-January,"
214,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"1818-1819. Both cantos were published on July 15, 1819. Cantos III., IV."
215,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"were written in the winter of 1819-1820; Canto V., after an interval of"
216,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"nine months, in October-November, 1820, but the publication of Cantos"
217,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"III., IV., V. was delayed till August 8, 1821. The next interval was"
218,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"longer still, but it was the last. In June, 1822, Byron began to work at"
219,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"a sixth, and by the end of March, 1823, he had completed a sixteenth"
220,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"canto. But the publication of these later cantos, which had been"
221,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"declined by Murray, and were finally entrusted to John Hunt, was spread"
222,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"over a period of several months. Cantos VI., VII., VIII., with a"
223,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Preface, were published July 15; Cantos IX., X., XI, August 29; Cantos"
224,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"XII., XIII., XIV., December 17, 1823; and, finally, Cantos XV., XVI.,"
225,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"March 26, 1824. The composition of _Don Juan_, considered as a whole,"
226,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,synchronized with the composition of all the dramas (except _Manfred_)
227,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"and the following poems: _The Prophecy of Dante_, (the translation of)"
228,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"_The Morgante Maggiore, The Vision of Judgment, The Age of Bronze_, and"
229,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,_The Island_.
230,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,
231,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"There is little to be said with regard to the ""Sources"" of _Don Juan_."
232,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Frere's _Whistlecraft_ had suggested _Beppo_, and, at the same time, had"
233,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"prompted and provoked a sympathetic study of Frere's Italian models,"
234,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Berni and Pulci (see ""Introduction to _Beppo_,"" _Poetical Works_, 1901,"
235,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"iv. 155-158; and ""Introduction to _The Morgante Maggiore_"" ibid., pp."
236,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"279-281); and, again, the success of _Beppo_, and, still more, a sense"
237,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,of inspiration and the conviction that he had found the path to
238,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"excellence, suggested another essay of the _ottava rima_, a humorous"
239,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"poem ""_à la Beppo_"" on a larger and more important scale. If Byron"
240,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"possessed more than a superficial knowledge of the legendary ""Don Juan,"""
241,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"he was irresponsive and unimpressed. He speaks (letter to Murray,"
242,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"February 16, 1821) of ""the Spanish tradition;"" but there is nothing to"
243,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,show that he had read or heard of Tirso de Molina's (Gabriel Tellez) _El
244,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,Burlador de Sevilla y Convidado de Piedra_ (_The Deceiver of Seville and
245,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"the Stone Guest_), 1626, which dramatized the ""ower true tale"" of the"
246,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,actual Don Juan Tenorio; or that he was acquainted with any of the
247,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Italian (e.g. _Convitato di Pietra_, del Dottor Giacinto Andrea"
248,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Cicognini, Fiorentino [see L. Allacci _Dramaturgia_, 1755, 4º, p. 862])"
249,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"or French adaptations of the legend (_e.g_. _Le Festin de Pierre, ou le"
250,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"fils criminel_, Tragi-comédie de De Villiers, 1659; and Molière's _Dom"
251,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Juan, ou Le Festin de Pierre_, 1665). He had seen (_vide post_, p. 11,"
252,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"note 2) Delpini's pantomime, which was based on Shadwell's"
253,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"_Libertine_, and he may have witnessed, at Milan or Venice, a"
254,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,performance of Mozart's _Don Giovanni_; but in taking Don Juan for his
255,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"""hero,"" he took the name only, and disregarded the ""terrible figure"" ""of"
256,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"the Titan of embodied evil, the likeness of sin made flesh"" (see"
257,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"_Selections from the Works of Lord Byron_, by A.C. Swinburne, 1885, p."
258,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"xxvi.), ""as something to his purpose nothing""!"
259,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,
260,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Why, then, did he choose the name, and what was the scheme or motif of"
261,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,his poem? Something is to be gathered from his own remarks and
262,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"reflections; but it must be borne in mind that he is on the defensive,"
263,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,and that his half-humorous paradoxes were provoked by advice and
264,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"opposition. Writing to Moore (September 19, 1818), he says, ""I have"
265,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,finished the first canto ... of a poem in the style and manner of
266,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"_Beppo_, encouraged by the good success of the same. It is ... meant to"
267,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,be a little quietly facetious upon every thing. But I doubt whether it
268,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,is not--at least as far as it has gone--too free for these very modest
269,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"days."" The critics before and after publication thought that _Don Juan_"
270,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"_was_ ""too free,"" and, a month after the two first cantos had been"
271,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"issued, he writes to Murray (August 12, 1819), ""You ask me for the plan"
272,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,of Donny Johnny; I _have_ no plan--I _had_ no plan; but I had or have
273,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,materials.... You are too earnest and eager about a work never intended
274,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,to be serious. Do you suppose that I could have any intention but to
275,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"giggle and make giggle?--a playful satire, with as little poetry as"
276,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"could be helped, was what I meant."" Again, after the completion but"
277,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"before the publication of Cantos III., IV., V., in a letter to Murray"
278,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"(February 16, 1821), he writes, ""The Fifth is so far from being the last"
279,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"of _Don Juan_, that it is hardly the beginning. I meant to take him the"
280,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"tour of Europe, with a proper mixture of siege, battle, and adventure,"
281,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,and to make him finish as Anacharsis Cloots in the French Revolution....
282,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"I meant to have made him a _Cavalier Servente_ in Italy, and a cause for"
283,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"a divorce in England, and a Sentimental 'Werther-faced' man in Germany,"
284,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,so as to show the different ridicules of the society in each of these
285,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"countries, and to have displayed him gradually _gâté_ and _blasé_, as he"
286,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"grew older, as is natural. But I had not quite fixed whether to make him"
287,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"end in Hell, or in an unhappy marriage, not knowing which would be the"
288,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"severest."""
289,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,
290,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Byron meant what he said, but he kept back the larger truth. Great"
291,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"works, in which the poet speaks _ex animo_, and the man lays bare the"
292,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"very pulse of the machine, are not conceived or composed unconsciously"
293,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"and at haphazard. Byron did not ""whistle"" _Don Juan_ ""for want of"
294,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"thought."" He had found a thing to say, and he meant to make the world"
295,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"listen. He had read with angry disapproval, but he had read, Coleridge's"
296,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"_Critique on_ [Maturin's] _Bertram_ (_vide post_, p. 4, note 1), and,"
297,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"it may be, had caught an inspiration from one brilliant sentence which"
298,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,depicts the Don Juan of the legend somewhat after the likeness of Childe
299,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Harold, if not of Lord Byron: ""Rank, fortune, wit, talent, acquired"
300,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"knowledge, and liberal accomplishments, with beauty of person, vigorous"
301,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"health, ... all these advantages, elevated by the habits and sympathies"
302,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"of noble birth and natural character, are ... combined in Don Juan, so"
303,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,as to give him the means of carrying into all its practical consequences
304,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,the doctrine of a godless nature ... Obedience to nature is the only
305,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"virtue."" Again, ""It is not the wickedness of Don Juan ... which"
306,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"constitutes the character an abstraction, ... but the rapid succession"
307,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"of the correspondent acts and incidents, his intellectual superiority,"
308,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,and the splendid accumulation of his gifts and desirable qualities as
309,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"coexistent with entire wickedness in one and the same person."" Here was"
310,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,at once a suggestion and a challenge.
311,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,
312,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Would it not be possible to conceive and to depict an ideal character,"
313,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"gifted, gracious, and delightful, who should ""carry into all its"
314,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"practical consequences"" the doctrine of a mundane, if not godless"
315,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"doctrine, and, at the same time, retain the charities and virtues of"
316,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,uncelestial but not devilish manhood? In defiance of monition and in
317,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"spite of resolution, the primrose path is trodden by all sorts and"
318,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"conditions of men, sinners no doubt, but not necessarily abstractions of"
319,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"sin, and to assert the contrary makes for cant and not for"
320,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,righteousness. The form and substance of the poem were due to the
321,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"compulsion of Genius and the determination of Art, but the argument is a"
322,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"vindication of the natural man. It is Byron's ""criticism of life."" _Don"
323,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,Juan_ was _taboo_ from the first. The earlier issues of the first five
324,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,cantos were doubly anonymous. Neither author nor publisher subscribed
325,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"their names on the title-page. The book was a monster, and, as its maker"
326,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"had foreseen, ""all the world"" shuddered. Immoral, in the sense that it"
327,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"advocates immoral tenets, or prefers evil to good, it is not, but it is"
328,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"unquestionably a dangerous book, which (to quote Kingsley's words used"
329,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"in another connection) ""the young and innocent will do well to leave"
330,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"altogether unread."" It is dangerous because it ignores resistance and"
331,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"presumes submission to passion; it is dangerous because, as Byron"
332,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"admitted, it is ""now and then voluptuous;"" and it is dangerous, in a"
333,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"lesser degree, because, here and there, the purport of the quips and"
334,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,allusions is gross and offensive. No one can take up the book without
335,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,being struck and arrested by these violations of modesty and decorum;
336,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,but no one can master its contents and become possessed of it as a whole
337,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"without perceiving that the mirror is held up to nature, that it"
338,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"reflects spots and blemishes which, on a survey of the vast and various"
339,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"orb, dwindle into _natural_ and so comparative insignificance. Byron was"
340,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,under no delusion as to the grossness of _Don Juan_. His plea or
341,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"pretence, that he was sheltered by the superior grossness of Ariosto and"
342,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"La Fontaine, of Prior and of Fielding, is _nihil ad rem_, if it is not"
343,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"insincere. When Murray (May 3, 1819) charges him with ""approximations to"
344,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"indelicacy,"" he laughs himself away at the euphemism, but when Hobhouse"
345,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"and ""the Zoili of Albemarle Street"" talked to him ""about morality,"" he"
346,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"flames out, ""I maintain that it is the most moral of poems."" He looked"
347,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"upon his great work as a whole, and he knew that the ""_raison d'être_ of"
348,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"his song"" was not only to celebrate, but, by the white light of truth,"
349,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"to represent and exhibit the great things of the world--Love and War,"
350,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"and Death by sea and land, and Man, half-angel, half-demon--the comedy"
351,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"of his fortunes, and the tragedy of his passions and his fate."
352,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,
353,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,_Don Juan_ has won great praise from the great. Sir Walter Scott
354,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"(_Edinburgh Weekly Journal_, May 19, 1824) maintained that its creator"
355,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"""has embraced every topic of human life, and sounded every string of the"
356,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"divine harp, from its slightest to its most powerful and"
357,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"heart-astounding tones."" Goethe (_Kunst und Alterthum_, 1821 [ed."
358,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Weimar, iii. 197, and _Sämmtliche Werke_, xiii. 637]) described _Don"
359,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Juan_ as ""a work of boundless genius."" Shelley (letter to Byron, October"
360,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"21, 1821), on the receipt of Cantos III., IV., V., bore testimony to his"
361,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"""wonder and delight:"" ""This poem carries with it at once the stamp of"
362,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,originality and defiance of imitation. Nothing has ever been written
363,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"like it in English, nor, if I may venture to prophesy, will there be,"
364,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,unless carrying upon it the mark of a secondary and borrowed light....
365,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"You are building up a drama,"" he adds, ""such as England has not yet"
366,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"seen, and the task is sufficiently noble and worthy of you."" Again, of"
367,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"the fifth canto he writes (Shelley's _Prose Works_, ed. H. Buxton"
368,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"Forman, iv. 219), ""Every word has the stamp of immortality.... It"
369,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"fulfils, in a certain degree, what I have long preached of"
370,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"producing--something wholly new and relative to the age, and yet"
371,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"surpassingly beautiful."" Finally, a living poet, neither a disciple nor"
372,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"encomiast of Byron, pays eloquent tribute to the strength and splendour"
373,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"of _Don Juan_: ""Across the stanzas ... we swim forward as over the"
374,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"'broad backs of the sea;' they break and glitter, hiss and laugh, murmur"
375,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,and move like waves that sound or that subside. There is in them a
376,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"delicious resistance, an elastic motion, which salt water has and fresh"
377,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"water has not. There is about them a wide wholesome air, full of vivid"
378,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"light and constant wind, which is only felt at sea. Life undulates and"
379,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,Death palpitates in the splendid verse.... This gift of life and variety
380,INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_,"is the supreme quality of Byron's chief poem"" (_A Selection, etc._, by"

1067,XXVII.,"Yet when they asked her for her depositions,"
1068,XXVII.,"No sort of explanation could be had,"
1069,XXVII.,Save that her duty both to man and God[36]

1071,XXVII.,
1072,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
1073,XXVIII.,
1074,XXVIII.,"She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,"

1076,XXVIII.,"All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;"
1077,XXVIII.,"And then she had all Seville for abettors,"
1078,XXVIII.,Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
1079,XXVIII.,"The hearers of her case became repeaters,"
1080,XXVIII.,"Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,"

1082,XXVIII.,
1083,XXIX.,XXIX.
1084,XXIX.,

1164,XXXVI.,Let's own--since it can do no good on earth--[h]

1166,XXXVI.,"Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,"
1167,XXXVI.,Where all his household gods lay shivered round him:[39]
1168,XXXVI.,"No choice was left his feelings or his pride,"

1188,XXXVIII.,"Then, for accomplishments of chivalry,"
1189,XXXVIII.,"In case our Lord the King should go to war again,"

1298,XLVIII.,"Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,"

1320,L.,"His natural spirit not in vain they toiled,"
1321,L.,At least it seemed so; and his mother's joy

1331,LI.,From sire to son to augur good or ill:
1332,LI.,He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--

1349,LIII.,"For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,"

1352,LIII.,"I say that there's the place--but ""_Verbum sat_,"""
1353,LIII.,"I think I picked up too, as well as most,"
1354,LIII.,Knowledge of matters--but no matter _what_--

1504,LXVII.,"Which Time had lately rendered much more chaste,"
1505,LXVII.,"She took his lady also in affection,"
1506,LXVII.,And certainly this course was much the best:
1507,LXVII.,"She flattered Julia with her sage protection,"
1508,LXVII.,And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
1509,LXVII.,"And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,"
1510,LXVII.,At least she left it a more slender handle.
1511,LXVII.,
1512,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
1513,LXVIII.,
1514,LXVIII.,I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
1515,LXVIII.,"With other people's eyes, or if her own"
1516,LXVIII.,"Discoveries made, but none could be aware"
1517,LXVIII.,"Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;"
1518,LXVIII.,"Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,"
1519,LXVIII.,"Indifferent from the first, or callous grown:"
1520,LXVIII.,"I'm really puzzled what to think or say,"
1521,LXVIII.,She kept her counsel in so close a way.
1522,LXVIII.,
1523,LXIX.,LXIX.
1524,LXIX.,
1525,LXIX.,"Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,"
1526,LXIX.,Caressed him often--such a thing might be
1527,LXIX.,"Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,"
1528,LXIX.,"When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;"
1529,LXIX.,But I am not so sure I should have smiled
1530,LXIX.,"When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;"
1531,LXIX.,"These few short years make wondrous alterations,"
1532,LXIX.,Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.
1533,LXIX.,
1534,LXX.,LXX.
1535,LXX.,
1536,LXX.,"Whate'er the cause might be, they had become"
1537,LXX.,"Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,"
1538,LXX.,"Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,"
1539,LXX.,And much embarrassment in either eye;
1540,LXX.,There surely will be little doubt with some
1541,LXX.,"That Donna Julia knew the reason why,"
1542,LXX.,"But as for Juan, he had no more notion"
1543,LXX.,Than he who never saw the sea of Ocean.
1544,LXX.,
1545,LXXI.,LXXI.
1546,LXXI.,
1547,LXXI.,"Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,"
1548,LXXI.,And tremulously gentle her small hand
1549,LXXI.,"Withdrew itself from his, but left behind"
1550,LXXI.,"A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland"
1551,LXXI.,"And slight, so very slight, that to the mind"
1552,LXXI.,'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
1553,LXXI.,Wrought change with all Armida's[48] fairy art
1554,LXXI.,Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.
1555,LXXI.,
1556,LXXII.,LXXII.
1557,LXXII.,
1558,LXXII.,"And if she met him, though she smiled no more,"
1559,LXXII.,"She looked a sadness sweeter than her smile,"
1560,LXXII.,As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
1561,LXXII.,"She must not own, but cherished more the while"
1562,LXXII.,For that compression in its burning core;
1563,LXXII.,"Even Innocence itself has many a wile,"
1564,LXXII.,"And will not dare to trust itself with truth,"
1565,LXXII.,And Love is taught hypocrisy from youth.
1566,LXXII.,
1567,LXXIII.,LXXIII.
1568,LXXIII.,
1569,LXXIII.,"But Passion most dissembles, yet betrays"
1570,LXXIII.,Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
1571,LXXIII.,"Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays"
1572,LXXIII.,"Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,"
1573,LXXIII.,And in whatever aspect it arrays
1574,LXXIII.,"Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;"
1575,LXXIII.,"Coldness or Anger, even Disdain or Hate,"
1576,LXXIII.,"Are masks it often wears, and still too late."
1577,LXXIII.,
1578,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
1579,LXXIV.,
1580,LXXIV.,"Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,"
1581,LXXIV.,"And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,"
1582,LXXIV.,"And burning blushes, though for no transgression,"
1583,LXXIV.,"Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;"
1584,LXXIV.,"All these are little preludes to possession,"
1585,LXXIV.,"Of which young Passion cannot be bereft,"
1586,LXXIV.,And merely tend to show how greatly Love is
1587,LXXIV.,Embarrassed at first starting with a novice.
1588,LXXIV.,
1589,LXXV.,LXXV.
1590,LXXV.,
1591,LXXV.,Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
1592,LXXV.,"She felt it going, and resolved to make"
1593,LXXV.,"The noblest efforts for herself and mate,"
1594,LXXV.,"For Honour's, Pride's, Religion's, Virtue's sake:"
1595,LXXV.,"Her resolutions were most truly great,"
1596,LXXV.,And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
1597,LXXV.,"She prayed the Virgin Mary for her grace,"
1598,LXXV.,As being the best judge of a lady's case.[49]
1599,LXXV.,
1600,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
1601,LXXVI.,
1602,LXXVI.,"She vowed she never would see Juan more,"
1603,LXXVI.,"And next day paid a visit to his mother,"
1604,LXXVI.,"And looked extremely at the opening door,"
1605,LXXVI.,"Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;"
1606,LXXVI.,"Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--"
1607,LXXVI.,"Again it opens, it can be no other,"
1608,LXXVI.,'T is surely Juan now--No! I'm afraid
1609,LXXVI.,That night the Virgin was no further prayed.[50]
1610,LXXVI.,
1611,LXXVII.,LXXVII.
1612,LXXVII.,
1613,LXXVII.,She now determined that a virtuous woman
1614,LXXVII.,"Should rather face and overcome temptation,"
1615,LXXVII.,"That flight was base and dastardly, and no man"
1616,LXXVII.,"Should ever give her heart the least sensation,"
1617,LXXVII.,"That is to say, a thought beyond the common"
1618,LXXVII.,"Preference, that we must feel, upon occasion,"
1619,LXXVII.,"For people who are pleasanter than others,"
1620,LXXVII.,But then they only seem so many brothers.
1621,LXXVII.,
1622,LXXVIII.,LXXVIII.
1623,LXXVIII.,
1624,LXXVIII.,And even if by chance--and who can tell?
1625,LXXVIII.,The Devil's so very sly--she should discover
1626,LXXVIII.,"That all within was not so very well,"
1627,LXXVIII.,"And, if still free, that such or such a lover"
1628,LXXVIII.,"Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell"
1629,LXXVIII.,"Such thoughts, and be the better when they're over;"
1630,LXXVIII.,"And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:"
1631,LXXVIII.,I recommend young ladies to make trial.
1632,LXXVIII.,
1633,LXXIX.,LXXIX.
1634,LXXIX.,
1635,LXXIX.,"And, then, there are such things as Love divine,"
1636,LXXIX.,"Bright and immaculate, unmixed and pure,"
1637,LXXIX.,"Such as the angels think so very fine,"
1638,LXXIX.,"And matrons, who would be no less secure,"
1639,LXXIX.,"Platonic, perfect, ""just such love as mine;"""
1640,LXXIX.,"Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;"
1641,LXXIX.,"And so I'd have her think, were _I_ the man"
1642,LXXIX.,On whom her reveries celestial ran.
1643,LXXIX.,
1644,LXXX.,LXXX.
1645,LXXX.,
1646,LXXX.,"Such love is innocent, and may exist"
1647,LXXX.,Between young persons without any danger.
1648,LXXX.,"A hand may first, and then a lip be kissed;"
1649,LXXX.,"For my part, to such doings I'm a stranger,"
1650,LXXX.,But _hear_ these freedoms form the utmost list
1651,LXXX.,Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
1652,LXXX.,"If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,"
1653,LXXX.,But not my fault--I tell them all in time.
1654,LXXX.,
1655,LXXXI.,LXXXI.
1656,LXXXI.,
1657,LXXXI.,"Love, then, but Love within its proper limits,"
1658,LXXXI.,Was Julia's innocent determination
1659,LXXXI.,"In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its"
1660,LXXXI.,Exertion might be useful on occasion;
1661,LXXXI.,"And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its"
1662,LXXXI.,"Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion"
1663,LXXXI.,"He might be taught, by Love and her together--"
1664,LXXXI.,"I really don't know what, nor Julia either."
1665,LXXXI.,
1666,LXXXII.,LXXXII.
1667,LXXXII.,
1668,LXXXII.,"Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced"
1669,LXXXII.,In mail of proof--her purity of soul[51]--
1670,LXXXII.,"She, for the future, of her strength convinced,"
1671,LXXXII.,"And that her honour was a rock, or mole,[n]"
1672,LXXXII.,Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
1673,LXXXII.,With any kind of troublesome control;
1674,LXXXII.,But whether Julia to the task was equal
1675,LXXXII.,Is that which must be mentioned in the sequel.
1676,LXXXII.,
1677,LXXXIII.,LXXXIII.
1678,LXXXIII.,
1679,LXXXIII.,"Her plan she deemed both innocent and feasible,"
1680,LXXXIII.,"And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen"
1681,LXXXIII.,"Not Scandal's fangs could fix on much that's seizable,"
1682,LXXXIII.,"Or if they did so, satisfied to mean"
1683,LXXXIII.,"Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--"
1684,LXXXIII.,A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
1685,LXXXIII.,"Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded"
1686,LXXXIII.,That all the Apostles would have done as they did.
1687,LXXXIII.,
1688,LXXXIV.,LXXXIV.
1689,LXXXIV.,
1690,LXXXIV.,"And if in the mean time her husband died,"
1691,LXXXIV.,But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
1692,LXXXIV.,"Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sighed)"
1693,LXXXIV.,Never could she survive that common loss;
1694,LXXXIV.,"But just suppose that moment should betide,"
1695,LXXXIV.,I only say suppose it--_inter nos_:
1696,LXXXIV.,"(This should be _entre nous_, for Julia thought"
1697,LXXXIV.,"In French, but then the rhyme would go for nought.)"
1698,LXXXIV.,
1699,LXXXV.,LXXXV.
1700,LXXXV.,
1701,LXXXV.,"I only say, suppose this supposition:"
1702,LXXXV.,Juan being then grown up to man's estate
1703,LXXXV.,"Would fully suit a widow of condition,"
1704,LXXXV.,Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
1705,LXXXV.,And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
1706,LXXXV.,"The mischief, after all, could not be great,"
1707,LXXXV.,"For he would learn the rudiments of Love,"

1714,LXXXVI.,"Of his own case, and never hit the true one;"
1715,LXXXVI.,"In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,[52]"
1716,LXXXVI.,"He puzzled over what he found a new one,"
1717,LXXXVI.,But not as yet imagined it could be a
1718,LXXXVI.,"Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,"

1721,LXXXVII.,LXXXVII.
1722,LXXXVII.,
1723,LXXXVII.,"Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,"

1725,LXXXVII.,"Tormented with a wound he could not know,"
1726,LXXXVII.,"His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:"
1727,LXXXVII.,"I'm fond myself of solitude or so,"
1728,LXXXVII.,"But then, I beg it may be understood,"

2350,CXLIV.,"Under the bed they searched, and there they found--"
2351,CXLIV.,No matter what--it was not that they sought;
2352,CXLIV.,"They opened windows, gazing if the ground"
2353,CXLIV.,"Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;"
2354,CXLIV.,And then they stared each others' faces round:
2355,CXLIV.,"'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,"
2356,CXLIV.,"And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,"
2357,CXLIV.,Of looking _in_ the bed as well as under.

2361,CXLV.,During this inquisition Julia's tongue[ad]

2363,CXLV.,"""Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!"
2364,CXLV.,It was for this that I became a bride!
2365,CXLV.,For this in silence I have suffered long
2366,CXLV.,A husband like Alfonso at my side;
2367,CXLV.,"But now I'll bear no more, nor here remain,"
2368,CXLV.,If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

2372,CXLVI.,"""Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,"
2373,CXLVI.,"If ever you indeed deserved the name,"
2374,CXLVI.,Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--
2375,CXLVI.,"Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--"
2376,CXLVI.,"Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore"
2377,CXLVI.,For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
2378,CXLVI.,"Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,"
2379,CXLVI.,How dare you think your lady would go on so?

2381,CXLVII.,CXLVII.
2382,CXLVII.,
2383,CXLVII.,"""Is it for this I have disdained to hold"
2384,CXLVII.,The common privileges of my sex?
2385,CXLVII.,That I have chosen a confessor so old
2386,CXLVII.,"And deaf, that any other it would vex,"
2387,CXLVII.,"And never once he has had cause to scold,"
2388,CXLVII.,But found my very innocence perplex
2389,CXLVII.,"So much, he always doubted I was married--"

2396,CXLVIII.,"Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,"
2397,CXLVIII.,"Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?"
2398,CXLVIII.,"Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,"
2399,CXLVIII.,"I favoured none--nay, was almost uncivil?"
2400,CXLVIII.,"Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,"
2401,CXLVIII.,"Who took Algiers,[75] declares I used him vilely?"

2409,CXLIX.,"Were there not also Russians, English, many?"
2410,CXLIX.,"The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,"
2411,CXLIX.,"And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,"

2415,CL.,
2416,CL.,"""Have I not had two bishops at my feet?"
2417,CL.,"The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez;"

2430,CLI.,"Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible"
2431,CLI.,"Of having played the fool? though both I spurn, he"
2432,CLI.,"Deserves the worst, his conduct's less defensible,"

2471,CLV.,"""At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,"

2474,CLV.,(Antonia! let me have a glass of water.)
2475,CLV.,"I am ashamed of having shed these tears,"
2476,CLV.,They are unworthy of my father's daughter;

2485,CLVI.,"Look where you please--we've nothing, sir, to hide;"
2486,CLVI.,"Only another time, I trust, you'll tell us,"
2487,CLVI.,Or for the sake of decency abide
2488,CLVI.,"A moment at the door, that we may be"

2504,CLVIII.,"She ceased, and turned upon her pillow; pale"
2505,CLVIII.,"She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,"
2506,CLVIII.,"Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,"
2507,CLVIII.,"Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears"
2508,CLVIII.,"Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail"
2509,CLVIII.,"To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears"
2510,CLVIII.,"Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,"
2511,CLVIII.,And louder than her breathing beats her heart.
2512,CLVIII.,
2513,CLIX.,CLIX.
2514,CLIX.,
2515,CLIX.,The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
2516,CLIX.,"Antonia bustled round the ransacked room,"
2517,CLIX.,"And, turning up her nose, with looks abused"
2518,CLIX.,"Her master, and his myrmidons, of whom"
2519,CLIX.,"Not one, except the attorney, was amused;"
2520,CLIX.,"He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,"
2521,CLIX.,"So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,"
2522,CLIX.,Knowing they must be settled by the laws.
2523,CLIX.,
2524,CLX.,CLX.
2525,CLX.,
2526,CLX.,"With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,"
2527,CLX.,"Following Antonia's motions here and there,"
2528,CLX.,With much suspicion in his attitude;
2529,CLX.,For reputations he had little care;
2530,CLX.,"So that a suit or action were made good,"
2531,CLX.,"Small pity had he for the young and fair,"
2532,CLX.,"And ne'er believed in negatives, till these"
2533,CLX.,Were proved by competent false witnesses.
2534,CLX.,
2535,CLXI.,CLXI.
2536,CLXI.,
2537,CLXI.,"But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,"
2538,CLXI.,"And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;"
2539,CLXI.,"When, after searching in five hundred nooks,"
2540,CLXI.,"And treating a young wife with so much rigour,"
2541,CLXI.,"He gained no point, except some self-rebukes,"
2542,CLXI.,Added to those his lady with such vigour
2543,CLXI.,"Had poured upon him for the last half-hour,"
2544,CLXI.,"Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower."
2545,CLXI.,
2546,CLXII.,CLXII.
2547,CLXII.,
2548,CLXII.,"At first he tried to hammer an excuse,"
2549,CLXII.,"To which the sole reply was tears, and sobs,"
2550,CLXII.,"And indications of hysterics, whose"
2551,CLXII.,"Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,"
2552,CLXII.,"Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:"
2553,CLXII.,"Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;[77]"
2554,CLXII.,"He saw too, in perspective, her relations,"
2555,CLXII.,And then he tried to muster all his patience.
2556,CLXII.,
2557,CLXIII.,CLXIII.
2558,CLXIII.,
2559,CLXIII.,"He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,"
2560,CLXIII.,But sage Antonia cut him short before
2561,CLXIII.,"The anvil of his speech received the hammer,"
2562,CLXIII.,"With ""Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,"
2563,CLXIII.,"Or madam dies.""--Alfonso muttered, ""D--n her,""[78]"
2564,CLXIII.,"But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;"
2565,CLXIII.,"He cast a rueful look or two, and did,"
2566,CLXIII.,"He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid."
2567,CLXIII.,
2568,CLXIV.,CLXIV.
2569,CLXIV.,
2570,CLXIV.,"With him retired his _""posse comitatus,""_"
2571,CLXIV.,"The attorney last, who lingered near the door"
2572,CLXIV.,"Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as"
2573,CLXIV.,Antonia let him--not a little sore
2574,CLXIV.,"At this most strange and unexplained ""_hiatus_"""
2575,CLXIV.,"In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore"
2576,CLXIV.,"An awkward look; as he revolved the case,"
2577,CLXIV.,The door was fastened in his legal face.
2578,CLXIV.,
2579,CLXV.,CLXV.
2580,CLXV.,
2581,CLXV.,"No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh Shame!"
2582,CLXV.,Oh Sin! Oh Sorrow! and Oh Womankind!
2583,CLXV.,"How can you do such things and keep your fame,"
2584,CLXV.,"Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?"
2585,CLXV.,Nothing so dear as an unfilched good name!
2586,CLXV.,But to proceed--for there is more behind:
2587,CLXV.,"With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,"
2588,CLXV.,"Young Juan slipped, half-smothered, from the bed."
2589,CLXV.,
2590,CLXVI.,CLXVI.
2591,CLXVI.,
2592,CLXVI.,He had been hid--I don't pretend to say
2593,CLXVI.,"How, nor can I indeed describe the where--"
2594,CLXVI.,"Young, slender, and packed easily, he lay,"
2595,CLXVI.,"No doubt, in little compass, round or square;"
2596,CLXVI.,But pity him I neither must nor may
2597,CLXVI.,His suffocation by that pretty pair;
2598,CLXVI.,"'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut"
2599,CLXVI.,With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.[ag]
2600,CLXVI.,
2601,CLXVII.,CLXVII.
2602,CLXVII.,
2603,CLXVII.,"And, secondly, I pity not, because"
2604,CLXVII.,"He had no business to commit a sin,"
2605,CLXVII.,"Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws;--"
2606,CLXVII.,"At least 't was rather early to begin,"
2607,CLXVII.,But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
2608,CLXVII.,So much as when we call our old debts in
2609,CLXVII.,"At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,"
2610,CLXVII.,And find a deuced balance with the Devil.[ah]
2611,CLXVII.,
2612,CLXVIII.,CLXVIII.
2613,CLXVIII.,
2614,CLXVIII.,Of his position I can give no notion:
2615,CLXVIII.,"'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,"
2616,CLXVIII.,"How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,"
2617,CLXVIII.,"Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,"
2618,CLXVIII.,"When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,"
2619,CLXVIII.,And that the medicine answered very well;
2620,CLXVIII.,"Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,"
2621,CLXVIII.,"For David lived, but Juan nearly died."
2622,CLXVIII.,
2623,CLXIX.,CLXIX.
2624,CLXIX.,
2625,CLXIX.,What's to be done? Alfonso will be back
2626,CLXIX.,The moment he has sent his fools away.
2627,CLXIX.,"Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,"
2628,CLXIX.,But no device could be brought into play--
2629,CLXIX.,And how to parry the renewed attack?
2630,CLXIX.,"Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:"
2631,CLXIX.,"Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,"
2632,CLXIX.,But pressed her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.
2633,CLXIX.,
2634,CLXX.,CLXX.
2635,CLXX.,
2636,CLXX.,"He turned his lip to hers, and with his hand"
2637,CLXX.,Called back the tangles of her wandering hair;
2638,CLXX.,"Even then their love they could not all command,"
2639,CLXX.,And half forgot their danger and despair:
2640,CLXX.,Antonia's patience now was at a stand--
2641,CLXX.,"""Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,"""
2642,CLXX.,"She whispered, in great wrath--""I must deposit"
2643,CLXX.,This pretty gentleman within the closet:
2644,CLXX.,
2645,CLXXI.,CLXXI.
2646,CLXXI.,
2647,CLXXI.,"""Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--"
2648,CLXXI.,_Who_ can have put my master in this mood?
2649,CLXXI.,"What will become on 't--I'm in such a fright,"
2650,CLXXI.,"The Devil's in the urchin, and no good--"
2651,CLXXI.,Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
2652,CLXXI.,"Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?"
2653,CLXXI.,"You'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,"
2654,CLXXI.,"My mistress all, for that half-girlish face."
2655,CLXXI.,
2656,CLXXII.,CLXXII.
2657,CLXXII.,
2658,CLXXII.,"""Had it but been for a stout cavalier[79]"
2659,CLXXII.,"Of twenty-five or thirty--(come, make haste)"
2660,CLXXII.,"But for a child, what piece of work is here!"
2661,CLXXII.,"I really, madam, wonder at your taste--"
2662,CLXXII.,"(Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:"
2663,CLXXII.,"There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,"
2664,CLXXII.,And if we can but till the morning keep
2665,CLXXII.,"Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep.)"""
2666,CLXXII.,
2667,CLXXIII.,CLXXIII.
2668,CLXXIII.,
2669,CLXXIII.,"Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,"
2670,CLXXIII.,Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
2671,CLXXIII.,"She loitered, and he told her to be gone,"
2672,CLXXIII.,An order somewhat sullenly obeyed;
2673,CLXXIII.,"However, present remedy was none,"
2674,CLXXIII.,And no great good seemed answered if she staid:
2675,CLXXIII.,"Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,"
2676,CLXXIII.,"She snuffed the candle, curtsied, and withdrew."
2677,CLXXIII.,
2678,CLXXIV.,CLXXIV.
2679,CLXXIV.,
2680,CLXXIV.,Alfonso paused a minute--then begun
2681,CLXXIV.,Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
2682,CLXXIV.,"He would not justify what he had done,"
2683,CLXXIV.,"To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;"
2684,CLXXIV.,"But there were ample reasons for it, none"
2685,CLXXIV.,Of which he specified in this his pleading:
2686,CLXXIV.,"His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,"
2687,CLXXIV.,"Of rhetoric, which the learned call ""_rigmarole._"""
2688,CLXXIV.,
2689,CLXXV.,CLXXV.
2690,CLXXV.,
2691,CLXXV.,Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
2692,CLXXV.,"A ready answer, which at once enables"
2693,CLXXV.,"A matron, who her husband's foible knows,"
2694,CLXXV.,"By a few timely words to turn the tables,"
2695,CLXXV.,"Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--"
2696,CLXXV.,Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
2697,CLXXV.,"'T is to retort with firmness, and when he"
2698,CLXXV.,"Suspects with _one_, do you reproach with _three_."
2699,CLXXV.,
2700,CLXXVI.,CLXXVI.
2701,CLXXVI.,
2702,CLXXVI.,"Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--"
2703,CLXXVI.,Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known;
2704,CLXXVI.,But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--
2705,CLXXVI.,"But that can't be, as has been often shown,"
2706,CLXXVI.,A lady with apologies abounds;--
2707,CLXXVI.,It might be that her silence sprang alone
2708,CLXXVI.,"From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,"
2709,CLXXVI.,To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.
2710,CLXXVI.,
2711,CLXXVII.,CLXXVII.
2712,CLXXVII.,
2713,CLXXVII.,"There might be one more motive, which makes two;"
2714,CLXXVII.,"Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--"
2715,CLXXVII.,"Mentioned his jealousy, but never who"
2716,CLXXVII.,"Had been the happy lover, he concluded,"
2717,CLXXVII.,"Concealed amongst his premises; 't is true,"
2718,CLXXVII.,His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
2719,CLXXVII.,"To speak of Inez now were, one may say,"
2720,CLXXVII.,Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.
2721,CLXXVII.,
2722,CLXXVIII.,CLXXVIII.
2723,CLXXVIII.,
2724,CLXXVIII.,"A hint, in tender cases, is enough;"
2725,CLXXVIII.,"Silence is best: besides, there is a _tact_[80]--"
2726,CLXXVIII.,"(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,"
2727,CLXXVIII.,But it will serve to keep my verse compact)--
2728,CLXXVIII.,"Which keeps, when pushed by questions rather rough,"
2729,CLXXVIII.,A lady always distant from the fact:
2730,CLXXVIII.,"The charming creatures lie with such a grace,"
2731,CLXXVIII.,There's nothing so becoming to the face.
2732,CLXXVIII.,
2733,CLXXIX.,CLXXIX.
2734,CLXXIX.,
2735,CLXXIX.,"They blush, and we believe them; at least I"
2736,CLXXIX.,"Have always done so; 't is of no great use,"
2737,CLXXIX.,"In any case, attempting a reply,"
2738,CLXXIX.,For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
2739,CLXXIX.,"And when at length they're out of breath, they sigh,"
2740,CLXXIX.,"And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose"
2741,CLXXIX.,"A tear or two, and then we make it up;"
2742,CLXXIX.,And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.
2743,CLXXIX.,
2744,CLXXX.,CLXXX.
2745,CLXXX.,
2746,CLXXX.,"Alfonso closed his speech, and begged her pardon,"
2747,CLXXX.,"Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,"
2748,CLXXX.,"And laid conditions he thought very hard on,"
2749,CLXXX.,Denying several little things he wanted:
2750,CLXXX.,"He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,"
2751,CLXXX.,With useless penitence perplexed and haunted;[ai]
2752,CLXXX.,"Beseeching she no further would refuse,"
2753,CLXXX.,"When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes."
2754,CLXXX.,
2755,CLXXXI.,CLXXXI.
2756,CLXXXI.,
2757,CLXXXI.,"A pair of shoes![81]--what then? not much, if they"
2758,CLXXXI.,"Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these"
2759,CLXXXI.,(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
2760,CLXXXI.,"Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,"
2761,CLXXXI.,Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!
2762,CLXXXI.,"My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze!"
2763,CLXXXI.,"Alfonso first examined well their fashion,"
2764,CLXXXI.,And then flew out into another passion.
2765,CLXXXI.,
2766,CLXXXII.,CLXXXII.

2781,CLXXXIII.,"Of all experience 't is the usual price,"
2782,CLXXXIII.,A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
2783,CLXXXIII.,"Juan had reached the room-door in a trice,"
2784,CLXXXIII.,"And might have done so by the garden-gate,"
2785,CLXXXIII.,"But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,"

2801,CLXXXV.,"Alfonso's sword had dropped ere he could draw it,"

2815,CLXXXVI.,"At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,"
2816,CLXXXVI.,"Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,"
2817,CLXXXVI.,And then his only garment quite gave way;

4577,XXX.,"And then the leak they reckoned to reduce,"
4578,XXX.,"And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet"
4579,XXX.,Kept two hand--and one chain-pump still in use.
4580,XXX.,The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
4581,XXX.,"A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,"
4582,XXX.,A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--
4583,XXX.,Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.
4584,XXX.,
4585,XXXI.,XXXI.
4586,XXXI.,
4587,XXXI.,"There she lay, motionless, and seemed upset;"
4588,XXXI.,"The water left the hold, and washed the decks,"
4589,XXXI.,And made a scene men do not soon forget;
4590,XXXI.,"For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,"
4591,XXXI.,Or any other thing that brings regret
4592,XXXI.,"Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:"
4593,XXXI.,"Thus drownings are much talked of by the divers,"
4594,XXXI.,"And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors."
4595,XXXI.,
4596,XXXII.,XXXII.
4597,XXXII.,
4598,XXXII.,"Immediately the masts were cut away,"
4599,XXXII.,"Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,"
4600,XXXII.,The main-mast followed: but the ship still lay
4601,XXXII.,"Like a mere log, and baffled our intent."
4602,XXXII.,"Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they"
4603,XXXII.,Eased her at last (although we never meant
4604,XXXII.,"To part with all till every hope was blighted),"
4605,XXXII.,And then with violence the old ship righted.[103]
4606,XXXII.,
4607,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
4608,XXXIII.,
4609,XXXIII.,"It may be easily supposed, while this"
4610,XXXIII.,"Was going on, some people were unquiet,"
4611,XXXIII.,That passengers would find it much amiss
4612,XXXIII.,"To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;"
4613,XXXIII.,"That even the able seaman, deeming his"
4614,XXXIII.,"Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,"
4615,XXXIII.,As upon such occasions tars will ask
4616,XXXIII.,"For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask."
4617,XXXIII.,
4618,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
4619,XXXIV.,
4620,XXXIV.,"There's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms"
4621,XXXIV.,"As rum and true religion: thus it was,"
4622,XXXIV.,"Some plundered, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,"
4623,XXXIV.,"The high wind made the treble, and as bass"
4624,XXXIV.,The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
4625,XXXIV.,Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
4626,XXXIV.,"Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,"
4627,XXXIV.,Clamoured in chorus to the roaring Ocean.
4628,XXXIV.,
4629,XXXV.,XXXV.
4630,XXXV.,
4631,XXXV.,"Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for[bc]"
4632,XXXV.,"Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,"
4633,XXXV.,"Got to the spirit-room, and stood before"
4634,XXXV.,"It with a pair of pistols;[104] and their fears,"
4635,XXXV.,As if Death were more dreadful by his door
4636,XXXV.,"Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,"
4637,XXXV.,"Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,"
4638,XXXV.,Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.
4639,XXXV.,
4640,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
4641,XXXVI.,
4642,XXXVI.,"""Give us more grog,"" they cried, ""for it will be"
4643,XXXVI.,"All one an hour hence."" Juan answered, ""No!"
4644,XXXVI.,"'T is true that Death awaits both you and me,"
4645,XXXVI.,"But let us die like men, not sink below"
4646,XXXVI.,"Like brutes:""--and thus his dangerous post kept he,"
4647,XXXVI.,And none liked to anticipate the blow;
4648,XXXVI.,"And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,"
4649,XXXVI.,Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.
4650,XXXVI.,
4651,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
4652,XXXVII.,
4653,XXXVII.,"The good old gentleman was quite aghast,"
4654,XXXVII.,And made a loud and pious lamentation;
4655,XXXVII.,"Repented all his sins, and made a last"
4656,XXXVII.,Irrevocable vow of reformation;
4657,XXXVII.,Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
4658,XXXVII.,"To quit his academic occupation,"
4659,XXXVII.,"In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,"
4660,XXXVII.,"To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca."
4661,XXXVII.,
4662,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
4663,XXXVIII.,
4664,XXXVIII.,But now there came a flash of hope once more;
4665,XXXVIII.,"Day broke, and the wind lulled: the masts were gone"
4666,XXXVIII.,"The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,"
4667,XXXVIII.,"The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.[105]"
4668,XXXVIII.,"They tried the pumps again, and though before"
4669,XXXVIII.,"Their desperate efforts seemed all useless grown,"
4670,XXXVIII.,A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--
4671,XXXVIII.,"The stronger pumped, the weaker thrummed a sail."
4672,XXXVIII.,
4673,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
4674,XXXIX.,
4675,XXXIX.,"Under the vessel's keel the sail was passed,"
4676,XXXIX.,And for the moment it had some effect;
4677,XXXIX.,"But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,"
4678,XXXIX.,"Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?"
4679,XXXIX.,"But still 't is best to struggle to the last,"
4680,XXXIX.,'T is never too late to be wholly wrecked:
4681,XXXIX.,"And though 't is true that man can only die once,"
4682,XXXIX.,'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.[bd]
4683,XXXIX.,
4684,XL.,XL.
4685,XL.,
4686,XL.,"There winds and waves had hurled them, and from thence,"
4687,XL.,"Without their will, they carried them away;"
4688,XL.,"For they were forced with steering to dispense,"
4689,XL.,And never had as yet a quiet day
4690,XL.,"On which they might repose, or even commence"
4691,XL.,"A jurymast or rudder, or could say"
4692,XL.,"The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,"
4693,XL.,Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.
4694,XL.,
4695,XLI.,XLI.
4696,XLI.,
4697,XLI.,"The wind, in fact, perhaps, was rather less,"
4698,XLI.,"But the ship laboured so, they scarce could hope"
4699,XLI.,To weather out much longer; the distress
4700,XLI.,Was also great with which they had to cope
4701,XLI.,"For want of water, and their solid mess"
4702,XLI.,Was scant enough: in vain the telescope
4703,XLI.,"Was used--nor sail nor shore appeared in sight,"
4704,XLI.,"Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night."
4705,XLI.,
4706,XLII.,XLII.
4707,XLII.,
4708,XLII.,"Again the weather threatened,--again blew"
4709,XLII.,"A gale, and in the fore and after hold"
4710,XLII.,"Water appeared; yet, though the people knew"
4711,XLII.,"All this, the most were patient, and some bold,"
4712,XLII.,Until the chains and leathers were worn through
4713,XLII.,"Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she rolled,"
4714,XLII.,"At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are"
4715,XLII.,Like human beings during civil war.
4716,XLII.,
4717,XLIII.,XLIII.
4718,XLIII.,
4719,XLIII.,"Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears"
4720,XLIII.,"In his rough eyes, and told the captain, he"
4721,XLIII.,"Could do no more: he was a man in years,"
4722,XLIII.,"And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,"
4723,XLIII.,And if he wept at length they were not fears
4724,XLIII.,"That made his eyelids as a woman's be,"
4725,XLIII.,"But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--"
4726,XLIII.,Two things for dying people quite bewildering.
4727,XLIII.,
4728,XLIV.,XLIV.
4729,XLIV.,
4730,XLIV.,The ship was evidently settling now
4731,XLIV.,"Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,"
4732,XLIV.,"Some went to prayers again, and made a vow"
4733,XLIV.,Of candles to their saints[106]--but there were none
4734,XLIV.,To pay them with; and some looked o'er the bow;
4735,XLIV.,Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
4736,XLIV.,"That begged Pedrillo for an absolution,"
4737,XLIV.,Who told him to be damned--in his confusion.[107]
4738,XLIV.,
4739,XLV.,XLV.
4740,XLV.,
4741,XLV.,Some lashed them in their hammocks; some put on
4742,XLV.,"Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;"
4743,XLV.,"Some cursed the day on which they saw the Sun,"
4744,XLV.,"And gnashed their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;"
4745,XLV.,"And others went on as they had begun,"
4746,XLV.,"Getting the boats out, being well aware"
4747,XLV.,"That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,"
4748,XLV.,Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.[108]
4749,XLV.,
4750,XLVI.,XLVI.
4751,XLVI.,
4752,XLVI.,"The worst of all was, that in their condition,"
4753,XLVI.,"Having been several days in great distress,"
4754,XLVI.,'T was difficult to get out such provision
4755,XLVI.,As now might render their long suffering less:
4756,XLVI.,"Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;[be]"
4757,XLVI.,Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
4758,XLVI.,"Two casks of biscuit, and a keg of butter,"
4759,XLVI.,Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.
4760,XLVI.,
4761,XLVII.,XLVII.
4762,XLVII.,
4763,XLVII.,But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
4764,XLVII.,"Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;"
4765,XLVII.,"Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;"
4766,XLVII.,Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get
4767,XLVII.,"A portion of their beef up from below,[109]"
4768,XLVII.,"And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,"
4769,XLVII.,But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--
4770,XLVII.,"Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon."
4771,XLVII.,
4772,XLVIII.,XLVIII.
4773,XLVIII.,
4774,XLVIII.,"The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had"
4775,XLVIII.,Been stove in the beginning of the gale;[110]
4776,XLVIII.,"And the long-boat's condition was but bad,"
4777,XLVIII.,"As there were but two blankets for a sail,[111]"
4778,XLVIII.,"And one oar for a mast, which a young lad"
4779,XLVIII.,Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
4780,XLVIII.,"And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,"
4781,XLVIII.,To save one half the people then on board.
4782,XLVIII.,
4783,XLIX.,XLIX.
4784,XLIX.,
4785,XLIX.,"'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down"
4786,XLIX.,"Over the waste of waters; like a veil,"
4787,XLIX.,"Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown[bf]"
4788,XLIX.,Of one whose hate is masked but to assail.
4789,XLIX.,"Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,"
4790,XLIX.,"And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,"
4791,XLIX.,And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear[bg]
4792,XLIX.,"Been their familiar, and now Death was here."
4793,XLIX.,
4794,L.,L.
4795,L.,
4796,L.,"Some trial had been making at a raft,"
4797,L.,"With little hope in such a rolling sea,"
4798,L.,"A sort of thing at which one would have laughed,[112]"
4799,L.,"If any laughter at such times could be,"
4800,L.,"Unless with people who too much have quaffed,"
4801,L.,"And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,"
4802,L.,"Half epileptical, and half hysterical:--"

4805,LI.,LI.
4806,LI.,
4807,LI.,"At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,"
4808,LI.,"And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,"
4809,LI.,"That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,[113]"
4810,LI.,"For yet they strove, although of no great use:"
4811,LI.,"There was no light in heaven but a few stars,"
4812,LI.,The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
4813,LI.,"She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,"
4814,LI.,"And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.[114]"
4815,LI.,
4816,LII.,LII.
4817,LII.,
4818,LII.,Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--
4819,LII.,"Then shrieked the timid, and stood still the brave,--"
4820,LII.,"Then some leaped overboard with dreadful yell,[115]"
4821,LII.,As eager to anticipate their grave;
4822,LII.,"And the sea yawned around her like a hell,"
4823,LII.,"And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,"
4824,LII.,"Like one who grapples with his enemy,"
4825,LII.,And strives to strangle him before he die.
4826,LII.,
4827,LIII.,LIII.
4828,LIII.,
4829,LIII.,"And first one universal shriek there rushed,"
4830,LIII.,"Louder than the loud Ocean, like a crash"
4831,LIII.,"Of echoing thunder; and then all was hushed,"
4832,LIII.,Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
4833,LIII.,"Of billows; but at intervals there gushed,"
4834,LIII.,"Accompanied by a convulsive splash,"
4835,LIII.,"A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry"
4836,LIII.,Of some strong swimmer in his agony.
4837,LIII.,
4838,LIV.,LIV.
4839,LIV.,
4840,LIV.,"The boats, as stated, had got off before,"
4841,LIV.,And in them crowded several of the crew;
4842,LIV.,And yet their present hope was hardly more
4843,LIV.,"Than what it had been, for so strong it blew"
4844,LIV.,There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
4845,LIV.,"And then they were too many, though so few--"
4846,LIV.,"Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,"
4847,LIV.,Were counted in them when they got afloat.
4848,LIV.,
4849,LV.,LV.
4850,LV.,
4851,LV.,All the rest perished; near two hundred souls
4852,LV.,"Had left their bodies; and what's worse, alas!"
4853,LV.,"When over Catholics the Ocean rolls,"
4854,LV.,They must wait several weeks before a mass
4855,LV.,"Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,"
4856,LV.,"Because, till people know what's come to pass,"
4857,LV.,They won't lay out their money on the dead--

4862,LVI.,"Juan got into the long-boat, and there"
4863,LVI.,Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
4864,LVI.,"It seemed as if they had exchanged their care,"
4865,LVI.,For Juan wore the magisterial face
4866,LVI.,"Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair"
4867,LVI.,Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
4868,LVI.,"Battista, though, (a name called shortly Tita),"
4869,LVI.,Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.
4870,LVI.,
4871,LVII.,LVII.
4872,LVII.,
4873,LVII.,"Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,"
4874,LVII.,"But the same cause, conducive to his loss,"
4875,LVII.,"Left him so drunk, he jumped into the wave,"
4876,LVII.,"As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,"
4877,LVII.,And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
4878,LVII.,"They could not rescue him although so close,"
4879,LVII.,"Because the sea ran higher every minute,"
4880,LVII.,And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.
4881,LVII.,
4882,LVIII.,LVIII.
4883,LVIII.,
4884,LVIII.,"A small old spaniel,--which had been Don José's,"
4885,LVIII.,"His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,"
4886,LVIII.,For on such things the memory reposes
4887,LVIII.,"With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,"
4888,LVIII.,"Knowing, (dogs have such intellectual noses!)"
4889,LVIII.,"No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;"
4890,LVIII.,"And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepped"
4891,LVIII.,"Off threw him in, then after him he leaped.[116]"
4892,LVIII.,
4893,LIX.,LIX.
4894,LIX.,
4895,LIX.,He also stuffed his money where he could
4896,LIX.,"About his person, and Pedrillo's too,"
4897,LIX.,"Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,"
4898,LIX.,"Not knowing what himself to say, or do,"
4899,LIX.,As every rising wave his dread renewed;
4900,LIX.,"But Juan, trusting they might still get through,"
4901,LIX.,"And deeming there were remedies for any ill,"
4902,LIX.,Thus re-embarked his tutor and his spaniel.

4905,LX.,
4906,LX.,"'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,"
4907,LX.,"That the sail was becalmed between the seas,[117]"
4908,LX.,"Though on the wave's high top too much to set,"
4909,LX.,They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
4910,LX.,"Each sea curled o'er the stern, and kept them wet,"
4911,LX.,"And made them bale without a moment's ease,[118]"
4912,LX.,"So that themselves as well as hopes were damped,"
4913,LX.,And the poor little cutter quickly swamped.
4914,LX.,
4915,LXI.,LXI.
4916,LXI.,
4917,LXI.,Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
4918,LXI.,"Kept above water, with an oar for mast,"
4919,LXI.,"Two blankets stitched together, answering ill"
4920,LXI.,"Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast;"
4921,LXI.,"Though every wave rolled menacing to fill,"
4922,LXI.,"And present peril all before surpassed,[119]"
4923,LXI.,"They grieved for those who perished with the cutter,"

4926,LXII.,LXII.
4927,LXII.,
4928,LXII.,"The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign"
4929,LXII.,Of the continuance of the gale: to run
4930,LXII.,"Before the sea until it should grow fine,"
4931,LXII.,Was all that for the present could be done:
4932,LXII.,A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
4933,LXII.,"Were served out to the people, who begun[120]"
4934,LXII.,"To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,"

4936,LXII.,
4937,LXIII.,LXIII.
4938,LXIII.,
4939,LXIII.,"They counted thirty, crowded in a space"
4940,LXIII.,Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
4941,LXIII.,"They did their best to modify their case,"
4942,LXIII.,"One half sate up, though numbed with the immersion,"
4943,LXIII.,"While t' other half were laid down in their place,"
4944,LXIII.,"At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian"
4945,LXIII.,"Ague in its cold fit, they filled their boat,"
4946,LXIII.,With nothing but the sky for a great coat.[121]
4947,LXIII.,
4948,LXIV.,LXIV.
4949,LXIV.,
4950,LXIV.,'T is very certain the desire of life

4952,LXIV.,"When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,"
4953,LXIV.,"Survive through very desperate conditions,"
4954,LXIV.,"Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife"

4964,LXV.,"That some, I really think, _do_ never die:"
4965,LXV.,"Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,"
4966,LXV.,And _that's_ their mode of furnishing supply:
4967,LXV.,"In my young days they lent me cash that way,"

4971,LXVI.,
4972,LXVI.,"'T is thus with people in an open boat,"
4973,LXVI.,"They live upon the love of Life, and bear"
4974,LXVI.,"More than can be believed, or even thought,"
4975,LXVI.,And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
4976,LXVI.,"And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,"
4977,LXVI.,Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
4978,LXVI.,"She had a curious crew as well as cargo,"

4981,LXVII.,LXVII.
4982,LXVII.,

4991,LXVII.,
4992,LXVIII.,LXVIII.

4996,LXVIII.,"And though at first their strength it might renew,"
4997,LXVIII.,"And lying on their weariness like balm,"
4998,LXVIII.,Lulled them like turtles sleeping on the blue
4999,LXVIII.,"Of Ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,"
5000,LXVIII.,"And fell all ravenously on their provision,"

5005,LXIX.,The consequence was easily foreseen--
5006,LXIX.,"They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,"
5007,LXIX.,"In spite of all remonstrances, and then"
5008,LXIX.,"On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?"
5009,LXIX.,"They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!"
5010,LXIX.,"And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,"
5011,LXIX.,"But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,"
5012,LXIX.,It would have been more wise to save their victual.

5016,LXX.,"The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,"
5017,LXX.,And Ocean slumbered like an unweaned child:
5018,LXX.,"The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,"
5019,LXX.,"The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--"
5020,LXX.,With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
5021,LXX.,What could they do? and Hunger's rage grew wild:
5022,LXX.,"So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,"
5023,LXX.,"Was killed, and portioned out for present eating.[123]"

5026,LXXI.,
5027,LXXI.,
5028,LXXI.,"On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,"

5030,LXXI.,"The creature was his father's dog that died,"
5031,LXXI.,"Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,"
5032,LXXI.,With some remorse received (though first denied)
5033,LXXI.,"As a great favour one of the fore-paws,[124]"
5034,LXXI.,"Which he divided with Pedrillo, who"
5035,LXXI.,"Devoured it, longing for the other too."

5039,LXXII.,"The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun"
5040,LXXII.,"Blistered and scorched, and, stagnant on the sea,"
5041,LXXII.,"They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,"
5042,LXXII.,Save in the breeze that came not: savagely
5043,LXXII.,"They glared upon each other--all was done,"
5044,LXXII.,"Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see"
5045,LXXII.,The longings of the cannibal arise
5046,LXXII.,(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.

5048,LXXIII.,LXXIII.
5049,LXXIII.,
5050,LXXIII.,"At length one whispered his companion, who"
5051,LXXIII.,"Whispered another, and thus it went round,"
5052,LXXIII.,"And then into a hoarser murmur grew,"
5053,LXXIII.,"An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;"
5054,LXXIII.,"And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,"
5055,LXXIII.,"'T was but his own, suppressed till now, he found:"
5056,LXXIII.,"And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,"
5057,LXXIII.,And who should die to be his fellow's food.
5058,LXXIII.,
5059,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
5060,LXXIV.,
5061,LXXIV.,"But ere they came to this, they that day shared"
5062,LXXIV.,"Some leathern caps, and what remained of shoes;"
5063,LXXIV.,"And then they looked around them, and despaired,"
5064,LXXIV.,And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
5065,LXXIV.,"At length the lots were torn up,[125] and prepared,"
5066,LXXIV.,But of materials that must shock the Muse--
5067,LXXIV.,"Having no paper, for the want of better,"
5068,LXXIV.,They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.
5069,LXXIV.,
5070,LXXV.,LXXV.
5071,LXXV.,
5072,LXXV.,"The lots were made, and marked, and mixed, and handed,"
5073,LXXV.,"In silent horror,[126] and their distribution"
5074,LXXV.,"Lulled even the savage hunger which demanded,"
5075,LXXV.,"Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;"
5076,LXXV.,"None in particular had sought or planned it,"
5077,LXXV.,"'T was Nature gnawed them to this resolution,"
5078,LXXV.,By which none were permitted to be neuter--
5079,LXXV.,And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.
5080,LXXV.,
5081,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
5082,LXXVI.,
5083,LXXVI.,He but requested to be bled to death:
5084,LXXVI.,"The surgeon had his instruments, and bled[127]"
5085,LXXVI.,"Pedrillo, and so gently ebbed his breath,"
5086,LXXVI.,You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
5087,LXXVI.,"He died as born, a Catholic in faith,"
5088,LXXVI.,"Like most in the belief in which they're bred,"
5089,LXXVI.,"And first a little crucifix he kissed,"
5090,LXXVI.,And then held out his jugular and wrist.
5091,LXXVI.,
5092,LXXVII.,LXXVII.
5093,LXXVII.,
5094,LXXVII.,"The surgeon, as there was no other fee,"
5095,LXXVII.,Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
5096,LXXVII.,"But being thirstiest at the moment, he"
5097,LXXVII.,Preferred a draught from the fast-flowing veins:[128]
5098,LXXVII.,"Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,"
5099,LXXVII.,And such things as the entrails and the brains
5100,LXXVII.,"Regaled two sharks, who followed o'er the billow--"
5101,LXXVII.,The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.
5102,LXXVII.,
5103,LXXVIII.,LXXVIII.
5104,LXXVIII.,
5105,LXXVIII.,"The sailors ate him, all save three or four,"
5106,LXXVIII.,Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
5107,LXXVIII.,"To these was added Juan, who, before"
5108,LXXVIII.,"Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could"
5109,LXXVIII.,Feel now his appetite increased much more;
5110,LXXVIII.,"'T was not to be expected that he should,"
5111,LXXVIII.,"Even in extremity of their disaster,"
5112,LXXVIII.,Dine with them on his pastor and his master.
5113,LXXVIII.,
5114,LXXIX.,LXXIX.
5115,LXXIX.,
5116,LXXIX.,"'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,"
5117,LXXIX.,The consequence was awful in the extreme;
5118,LXXIX.,"For they, who were most ravenous in the act,"
5119,LXXIX.,Went raging mad[129]--Lord! how they did blaspheme!
5120,LXXIX.,"And foam, and roll, with strange convulsions racked,"
5121,LXXIX.,"Drinking salt-water like a mountain-stream,"
5122,LXXIX.,"Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,"
5123,LXXIX.,"And, with hyæna-laughter, died despairing."

5126,LXXX.,
5127,LXXX.,"Their numbers were much thinned by this infliction,"

5129,LXXX.,"And some of them had lost their recollection,"
5130,LXXX.,Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
5131,LXXX.,"But others pondered on a new dissection,"
5132,LXXX.,As if not warned sufficiently by those
5133,LXXX.,"Who had already perished, suffering madly,"
5134,LXXX.,For having used their appetites so sadly.
5135,LXXX.,
5136,LXXXI.,LXXXI.
5137,LXXXI.,
5138,LXXXI.,"And next they thought upon the master's mate,"
5139,LXXXI.,"As fattest; but he saved himself, because,"
5140,LXXXI.,"Besides being much averse from such a fate,"
5141,LXXXI.,"There were some other reasons: the first was,"
5142,LXXXI.,He had been rather indisposed of late;
5143,LXXXI.,And--that which chiefly proved his saving clause--
5144,LXXXI.,"Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,"
5145,LXXXI.,By general subscription of the ladies.
5146,LXXXI.,
5147,LXXXII.,LXXXII.
5148,LXXXII.,
5149,LXXXII.,"Of poor Pedrillo something still remained,"
5150,LXXXII.,"But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,"
5151,LXXXII.,"And others still their appetites constrained,"
5152,LXXXII.,Or but at times a little supper made;
5153,LXXXII.,"All except Juan, who throughout abstained,"
5154,LXXXII.,"Chewing a piece of bamboo, and some lead:[130]"
5155,LXXXII.,"At length they caught two Boobies, and a Noddy,[131]"
5156,LXXXII.,And then they left off eating the dead body.
5157,LXXXII.,
5158,LXXXIII.,LXXXIII.

5171,LXXXIV.,"And the same night there fell a shower of rain,"

5174,LXXXIV.,Men really know not what good water's worth;
5175,LXXXIV.,"If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,"
5176,LXXXIV.,"Or with a famished boat's-crew had your berth,"

5184,LXXXV.,"Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,"
5185,LXXXV.,"And when they deemed its moisture was complete,"
5186,LXXXV.,"They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher[133]"
5187,LXXXV.,Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
5188,LXXXV.,"As a full pot of porter, to their thinking"

5195,LXXXVI.,"Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,"
5196,LXXXVI.,"As the rich man's in Hell, who vainly screamed"
5197,LXXXVI.,"To beg the beggar, who could not rain back"
5198,LXXXVI.,"A drop of dew, when every drop had seemed"

5218,LXXXVIII.,And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
5219,LXXXVIII.,"Little he said, and now and then he smiled,"
5220,LXXXVIII.,As if to win a part from off the weight
5221,LXXXVIII.,"He saw increasing on his father's heart,"

5223,LXXXVIII.,

5230,LXXXIX.,"And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,"
5231,LXXXIX.,"Brightened, and for a moment seemed to roam,"

5241,XC.,"He watched it wistfully, until away"

5307,XCVI.,"Some fancied they saw land, and some said ""No!"""
5308,XCVI.,The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--

5427,CVII.,And the hard wave o'erwhelmed him as 't was dashed
5428,CVII.,"Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore"
5429,CVII.,The waters beat while he thereto was lashed;
5430,CVII.,"At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he"
5431,CVII.,"Rolled on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:"
5432,CVII.,
5433,CVIII.,CVIII.
5434,CVIII.,
5435,CVIII.,"There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung"
5436,CVIII.,"Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,"
5437,CVIII.,"From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,"
5438,CVIII.,Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
5439,CVIII.,"And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,"
5440,CVIII.,"Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,"
5441,CVIII.,"With just enough of life to feel its pain,"
5442,CVIII.,"And deem that it was saved, perhaps, in vain."
5443,CVIII.,
5444,CIX.,CIX.
5445,CIX.,
5446,CIX.,"With slow and staggering effort he arose,"
5447,CIX.,But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
5448,CIX.,And quivering hand; and then he looked for those
5449,CIX.,Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
5450,CIX.,"But none of them appeared to share his woes,"
5451,CIX.,"Save one, a corpse, from out the famished three,"
5452,CIX.,"Who died two days before, and now had found"
5453,CIX.,An unknown barren beach for burial ground.
5454,CIX.,
5455,CX.,CX.
5456,CX.,
5457,CX.,"And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,"
5458,CX.,"And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand"
5459,CX.,"Swam round and round, and all his senses passed:"
5460,CX.,"He fell upon his side, and his stretched hand"
5461,CX.,"Drooped dripping on the oar (their jury-mast),"
5462,CX.,"And, like a withered lily, on the land"
5463,CX.,"His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,"
5464,CX.,As fair a thing as e'er was formed of clay.
5465,CX.,
5466,CXI.,CXI.
5467,CXI.,
5468,CXI.,How long in his damp trance young Juan lay[147]
5469,CXI.,"He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,"
5470,CXI.,And Time had nothing more of night nor day
5471,CXI.,"For his congealing blood, and senses dim;"
5472,CXI.,And how this heavy faintness passed away
5473,CXI.,"He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,"
5474,CXI.,"And tingling vein, seemed throbbing back to life,"
5475,CXI.,"For Death, though vanquished, still retired with strife."
5476,CXI.,
5477,CXII.,CXII.
5478,CXII.,
5479,CXII.,"His eyes he opened, shut, again unclosed,"
5480,CXII.,For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
5481,CXII.,"He still was in the boat, and had but dozed,"
5482,CXII.,"And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,"
5483,CXII.,"And wished it Death in which he had reposed,"
5484,CXII.,"And then once more his feelings back were brought,"
5485,CXII.,And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
5486,CXII.,A lovely female face of seventeen.
5487,CXII.,
5488,CXIII.,CXIII.
5489,CXIII.,
5490,CXIII.,"'T was bending close o'er his, and the small mouth"
5491,CXIII.,Seemed almost prying into his for breath;
5492,CXIII.,"And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth"
5493,CXIII.,Recalled his answering spirits back from Death:
5494,CXIII.,"And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe"
5495,CXIII.,"Each pulse to animation, till beneath"
5496,CXIII.,"Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh"
5497,CXIII.,To these kind efforts made a low reply.
5498,CXIII.,
5499,CXIV.,CXIV.
5500,CXIV.,
5501,CXIV.,"Then was the cordial poured, and mantle flung"
5502,CXIV.,Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
5503,CXIV.,Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
5504,CXIV.,"And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,"
5505,CXIV.,Pillowed his death-like forehead; then she wrung
5506,CXIV.,"His dewy curls, long drenched by every storm;"
5507,CXIV.,And watched with eagerness each throb that drew
5508,CXIV.,"A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too."
5509,CXIV.,
5510,CXV.,CXV.
5511,CXV.,
5512,CXV.,"And lifting him with care into the cave,"
5513,CXV.,"The gentle girl, and her attendant,--one"
5514,CXV.,"Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,"
5515,CXV.,"And more robust of figure,--then begun"
5516,CXV.,"To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave"
5517,CXV.,"Light to the rocks that roofed them, which the sun"
5518,CXV.,"Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er"
5519,CXV.,"She was, appeared distinct, and tall, and fair."
5520,CXV.,
5521,CXVI.,CXVI.
5522,CXVI.,
5523,CXVI.,"Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,"
5524,CXVI.,That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--
5525,CXVI.,"Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were rolled"
5526,CXVI.,In braids behind; and though her stature were
5527,CXVI.,"Even of the highest for a female mould,"
5528,CXVI.,They nearly reached her heel; and in her air
5529,CXVI.,"There was a something which bespoke command,"
5530,CXVI.,As one who was a Lady in the land.
5531,CXVI.,
5532,CXVII.,CXVII.
5533,CXVII.,
5534,CXVII.,"Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes"
5535,CXVII.,"Were black as Death, their lashes the same hue,"
5536,CXVII.,"Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies"
5537,CXVII.,Deepest attraction; for when to the view
5538,CXVII.,"Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,"
5539,CXVII.,Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
5540,CXVII.,"'T is as the snake late coiled, who pours his length,"
5541,CXVII.,And hurls at once his venom and his strength.
5542,CXVII.,
5543,CXVIII.,CXVIII.
5544,CXVIII.,
5545,CXVIII.,"Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye"
5546,CXVIII.,Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
5547,CXVIII.,Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh
5548,CXVIII.,Ever to have seen such; for she was one[bh]
5549,CXVIII.,Fit for the model of a statuary
5550,CXVIII.,"(A race of mere impostors, when all's done--"
5551,CXVIII.,"I've seen much finer women, ripe and real,"
5552,CXVIII.,Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).[bi][148]
5553,CXVIII.,
5554,CXIX.,CXIX.
5555,CXIX.,
5556,CXIX.,"I'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just"
5557,CXIX.,One should not rail without a decent cause:
5558,CXIX.,"There was an Irish lady,[149] to whose bust"
5559,CXIX.,"I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was"
5560,CXIX.,A frequent model; and if e'er she must
5561,CXIX.,"Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,"
5562,CXIX.,They will destroy a face which mortal thought
5563,CXIX.,"Ne'er compassed, nor less mortal chisel wrought."
5564,CXIX.,
5565,CXX.,CXX.
5566,CXX.,
5567,CXX.,"And such was she, the lady of the cave:"
5568,CXX.,"Her dress was very different from the Spanish,"
5569,CXX.,"Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;"
5570,CXX.,"For, as you know, the Spanish women banish"
5571,CXX.,"Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave"
5572,CXX.,Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
5573,CXX.,"The basquiña and the mantilla, they"
5574,CXX.,Seem at the same time mystical and gay.[150]
5575,CXX.,
5576,CXXI.,CXXI.
5577,CXXI.,
5578,CXXI.,But with our damsel this was not the case:
5579,CXXI.,"Her dress was many-coloured, finely spun;"
5580,CXXI.,"Her locks curled negligently round her face,"
5581,CXXI.,But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
5582,CXXI.,"Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace"
5583,CXXI.,"Flowed in her veil, and many a precious stone"
5584,CXXI.,"Flashed on her little hand; but, what was shocking,"
5585,CXXI.,"Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking."
5586,CXXI.,
5587,CXXII.,CXXII.
5588,CXXII.,
5589,CXXII.,"The other female's dress was not unlike,"
5590,CXXII.,But of inferior materials: she
5591,CXXII.,"Had not so many ornaments to strike,"
5592,CXXII.,"Her hair had silver only, bound to be"
5593,CXXII.,"Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,"
5594,CXXII.,"Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;"
5595,CXXII.,"Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes"
5596,CXXII.,"As black, but quicker, and of smaller size."
5597,CXXII.,
5598,CXXIII.,CXXIII.
5599,CXXIII.,
5600,CXXIII.,"And these two tended him, and cheered him both"
5601,CXXIII.,"With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,"
5602,CXXIII.,"Which are--as I must own--of female growth,"
5603,CXXIII.,And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
5604,CXXIII.,"They made a most superior mess of broth,"
5605,CXXIII.,"A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,"
5606,CXXIII.,But the best dish that e'er was cooked since Homer's
5607,CXXIII.,Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.[151]
5608,CXXIII.,
5609,CXXIV.,CXXIV.
5610,CXXIV.,
5611,CXXIV.,"I'll tell you who they were, this female pair,"
5612,CXXIV.,Lest they should seem Princesses in disguise;
5613,CXXIV.,"Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air"
5614,CXXIV.,"Of clap-trap, which your recent poets prize;"
5615,CXXIV.,"And so, in short, the girls they really were"
5616,CXXIV.,"They shall appear before your curious eyes,"
5617,CXXIV.,Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
5618,CXXIV.,"Of an old man, who lived upon the water."
5619,CXXIV.,
5620,CXXV.,CXXV.
5621,CXXV.,
5622,CXXV.,"A fisherman he had been in his youth,"
5623,CXXV.,And still a sort of fisherman was he;
5624,CXXV.,"But other speculations were, in sooth,"
5625,CXXV.,"Added to his connection with the sea,"
5626,CXXV.,"Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:"
5627,CXXV.,"A little smuggling, and some piracy,"
5628,CXXV.,"Left him, at last, the sole of many masters"
5629,CXXV.,Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.
5630,CXXV.,
5631,CXXVI.,CXXVI.
5632,CXXVI.,
5633,CXXVI.,"A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,"
5634,CXXVI.,"Like Peter the Apostle, and he fished"
5635,CXXVI.,"For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,"
5636,CXXVI.,And sometimes caught as many as he wished;
5637,CXXVI.,"The cargoes he confiscated, and gain"
5638,CXXVI.,"He sought in the slave-market too, and dished"
5639,CXXVI.,"Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,"
5640,CXXVI.,"By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made."
5641,CXXVI.,
5642,CXXVII.,CXXVII.
5643,CXXVII.,
5644,CXXVII.,"He was a Greek, and on his isle had built"
5645,CXXVII.,(One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
5646,CXXVII.,"A very handsome house from out his guilt,"
5647,CXXVII.,And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
5648,CXXVII.,"Heaven knows what cash he got, or blood he spilt,"
5649,CXXVII.,"A sad old fellow was he, if you please;"
5650,CXXVII.,"But this I know, it was a spacious building,"
5651,CXXVII.,"Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding."
5652,CXXVII.,
5653,CXXVIII.,CXXVIII.
5654,CXXVIII.,
5655,CXXVIII.,"He had an only daughter, called Haidée,"
5656,CXXVIII.,The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
5657,CXXVIII.,"Besides, so very beautiful was she,"
5658,CXXVIII.,Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
5659,CXXVIII.,"Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree"
5660,CXXVIII.,"She grew to womanhood, and between whiles"
5661,CXXVIII.,"Rejected several suitors, just to learn"
5662,CXXVIII.,How to accept a better in his turn.
5663,CXXVIII.,
5664,CXXIX.,CXXIX.
5665,CXXIX.,
5666,CXXIX.,"And walking out upon the beach, below"
5667,CXXIX.,"The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,"
5668,CXXIX.,"Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--"
5669,CXXIX.,"Don Juan, almost famished, and half drowned;"
5670,CXXIX.,"But being naked, she was shocked, you know,"
5671,CXXIX.,"Yet deemed herself in common pity bound,"
5672,CXXIX.,"As far as in her lay, ""to take him in,"
5673,CXXIX.,"A stranger"" dying--with so white a skin."
5674,CXXIX.,
5675,CXXX.,CXXX.
5676,CXXX.,
5677,CXXX.,But taking him into her father's house
5678,CXXX.,"Was not exactly the best way to save,"
5679,CXXX.,"But like conveying to the cat the mouse,"
5680,CXXX.,Or people in a trance into their grave;
5681,CXXX.,"Because the good old man had so much [Greek: ""nous""],"
5682,CXXX.,"Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,"
5683,CXXX.,"He would have hospitably cured the stranger,"
5684,CXXX.,And sold him instantly when out of danger.
5685,CXXX.,
5686,CXXXI.,CXXXI.
5687,CXXXI.,
5688,CXXXI.,"And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best"
5689,CXXXI.,(A virgin always on her maid relies)
5690,CXXXI.,To place him in the cave for present rest:
5691,CXXXI.,"And when, at last, he opened his black eyes,"
5692,CXXXI.,Their charity increased about their guest;
5693,CXXXI.,"And their compassion grew to such a size,"
5694,CXXXI.,It opened half the turnpike-gates to Heaven--
5695,CXXXI.,"(St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given)."
5696,CXXXI.,
5697,CXXXII.,CXXXII.
5698,CXXXII.,
5699,CXXXII.,"They made a fire,--but such a fire as they"
5700,CXXXII.,Upon the moment could contrive with such
5701,CXXXII.,"Materials as were cast up round the bay,--"
5702,CXXXII.,"Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch"
5703,CXXXII.,"Were nearly tinder, since, so long they lay,"
5704,CXXXII.,A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;
5705,CXXXII.,"But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,"
5706,CXXXII.,That there was fuel to have furnished twenty.
5707,CXXXII.,
5708,CXXXIII.,CXXXIII.
5709,CXXXIII.,
5710,CXXXIII.,"He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,[bj]"
5711,CXXXIII.,For Haidée stripped her sables off to make
5712,CXXXIII.,"His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,"
5713,CXXXIII.,"And warm, in case by chance he should awake,"
5714,CXXXIII.,"They also gave a petticoat apiece,"
5715,CXXXIII.,"She and her maid,--and promised by daybreak"
5716,CXXXIII.,"To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish"
5717,CXXXIII.,"For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish."
5718,CXXXIII.,
5719,CXXXIV.,CXXXIV.
5720,CXXXIV.,
5721,CXXXIV.,And thus they left him to his lone repose:
5722,CXXXIV.,"Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,"
5723,CXXXIV.,"Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),"
5724,CXXXIV.,Just for the present; and in his lulled head
5725,CXXXIV.,Not even a vision of his former woes
5726,CXXXIV.,"Throbbed in accurséd dreams, which sometimes spread[bk]"
5727,CXXXIV.,"Unwelcome visions of our former years,"
5728,CXXXIV.,"Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears."
5729,CXXXIV.,
5730,CXXXV.,CXXXV.
5731,CXXXV.,
5732,CXXXV.,"Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,"
5733,CXXXV.,"Who smoothed his pillow, as she left the den"
5734,CXXXV.,"Looked back upon him, and a moment stayed,"
5735,CXXXV.,"And turned, believing that he called again."
5736,CXXXV.,"He slumbered; yet she thought, at least she said"
5737,CXXXV.,"(The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),"
5738,CXXXV.,He had pronounced her name--but she forgot
5739,CXXXV.,That at this moment Juan knew it not.
5740,CXXXV.,
5741,CXXXVI.,CXXXVI.
5742,CXXXVI.,
5743,CXXXVI.,"And pensive to her father's house she went,"
5744,CXXXVI.,"Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who"
5745,CXXXVI.,"Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,"
5746,CXXXVI.,She being wiser by a year or two:
5747,CXXXVI.,"A year or two's an age when rightly spent,"
5748,CXXXVI.,"And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,"
5749,CXXXVI.,In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
5750,CXXXVI.,Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.
5751,CXXXVI.,
5752,CXXXVII.,CXXXVII.
5753,CXXXVII.,
5754,CXXXVII.,"The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still"
5755,CXXXVII.,"Fast in his cave, and nothing clashed upon"
5756,CXXXVII.,"His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,"
5757,CXXXVII.,"And the young beams of the excluded Sun,"
5758,CXXXVII.,"Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;"
5759,CXXXVII.,"And need he had of slumber yet, for none"
5760,CXXXVII.,Had suffered more--his hardships were comparative[bl]
5761,CXXXVII.,"To those related in my grand-dad's ""Narrative.""[152]"
5762,CXXXVII.,
5763,CXXXVIII.,CXXXVIII.
5764,CXXXVIII.,
5765,CXXXVIII.,"Not so Haidée: she sadly tossed and tumbled,"
5766,CXXXVIII.,"And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er,"
5767,CXXXVIII.,"Dreamed of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,"
5768,CXXXVIII.,And handsome corpses strewed upon the shore;
5769,CXXXVIII.,"And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,"
5770,CXXXVIII.,"And called her father's old slaves up, who swore"
5771,CXXXVIII.,"In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--"
5772,CXXXVIII.,They knew not what to think of such a freak.
5773,CXXXVIII.,
5774,CXXXIX.,CXXXIX.
5775,CXXXIX.,
5776,CXXXIX.,"But up she got, and up she made them get,"
5777,CXXXIX.,"With some pretence about the Sun, that makes"
5778,CXXXIX.,"Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;"
5779,CXXXIX.,"And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks"
5780,CXXXIX.,"Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet"
5781,CXXXIX.,"With mist, and every bird with him awakes,"
5782,CXXXIX.,And night is flung off like a mourning suit
5783,CXXXIX.,"Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.[bm]"
5784,CXXXIX.,
5785,CXL.,CXL.
5786,CXL.,
5787,CXL.,"I say, the Sun is a most glorious sight,"
5788,CXL.,"I've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late"
5789,CXL.,"I have sat up on purpose all the night,[bn][153]"
5790,CXL.,"Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;"
5791,CXL.,"And so all ye, who would be in the right"
5792,CXL.,"In health and purse, begin your day to date"
5793,CXL.,"From daybreak, and when coffined at fourscore,"
5794,CXL.,"Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four."
5795,CXL.,
5796,CXLI.,CXLI.
5797,CXLI.,
5798,CXLI.,And Haidée met the morning face to face;
5799,CXLI.,"Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush"
5800,CXLI.,"Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race"
5801,CXLI.,"From heart to cheek is curbed into a blush,"
5802,CXLI.,"Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,"
5803,CXLI.,"That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,"
5804,CXLI.,"Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;"
5805,CXLI.,Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.[154]
5806,CXLI.,
5807,CXLII.,CXLII.
5808,CXLII.,
5809,CXLII.,"And down the cliff the island virgin came,"
5810,CXLII.,"And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,"
5811,CXLII.,"While the Sun smiled on her with his first flame,"
5812,CXLII.,"And young Aurora kissed her lips with dew,"
5813,CXLII.,Taking her for a sister; just the same
5814,CXLII.,"Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,"
5815,CXLII.,"Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,"
5816,CXLII.,"Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.[bo]"
5817,CXLII.,
5818,CXLIII.,CXLIII.
5819,CXLIII.,
5820,CXLIII.,And when into the cavern Haidée stepped
5821,CXLIII.,"All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw"
5822,CXLIII.,That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
5823,CXLIII.,"And then she stopped, and stood as if in awe"
5824,CXLIII.,"(For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept"
5825,CXLIII.,"And wrapped him closer, lest the air, too raw,"
5826,CXLIII.,"Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as Death"
5827,CXLIII.,"Bent, with hushed lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath."
5828,CXLIII.,
5829,CXLIV.,CXLIV.
5830,CXLIV.,
5831,CXLIV.,And thus like to an Angel o'er the dying
5832,CXLIV.,"Who die in righteousness, she leaned; and there"
5833,CXLIV.,"All tranquilly the shipwrecked boy was lying,"
5834,CXLIV.,As o'er him lay the calm and stirless air:
5835,CXLIV.,"But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,"
5836,CXLIV.,"Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair"
5837,CXLIV.,"Must breakfast--and, betimes, lest they should ask it,"
5838,CXLIV.,She drew out her provision from the basket.
5839,CXLIV.,
5840,CXLV.,CXLV.
5841,CXLV.,
5842,CXLV.,"She knew that the best feelings must have victual,"
5843,CXLV.,And that a shipwrecked youth would hungry be;
5844,CXLV.,"Besides, being less in love, she yawned a little,"
5845,CXLV.,And felt her veins chilled by the neighbouring sea;
5846,CXLV.,"And so, she cooked their breakfast to a tittle;"
5847,CXLV.,"I can't say that she gave them any tea,"
5848,CXLV.,"But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,"
5849,CXLV.,"With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money."
5850,CXLV.,
5851,CXLVI.,CXLVI.
5852,CXLVI.,
5853,CXLVI.,"And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and"
5854,CXLVI.,"The coffee made, would fain have wakened Juan;"
5855,CXLVI.,"But Haidée stopped her with her quick small hand,"
5856,CXLVI.,"And without word, a sign her finger drew on"
5857,CXLVI.,"Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;"
5858,CXLVI.,"And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,"
5859,CXLVI.,Because her mistress would not let her break
5860,CXLVI.,That sleep which seemed as it would ne'er awake.
5861,CXLVI.,
5862,CXLVII.,CXLVII.
5863,CXLVII.,
5864,CXLVII.,"For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek"
5865,CXLVII.,A purple hectic played like dying day
5866,CXLVII.,On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
5867,CXLVII.,"Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,"
5868,CXLVII.,"Where the blue veins looked shadowy, shrunk, and weak;"
5869,CXLVII.,"And his black curls were dewy with the spray,"
5870,CXLVII.,"Which weighed upon them yet, all damp and salt,"
5871,CXLVII.,Mixed with the stony vapours of the vault.
5872,CXLVII.,
5873,CXLVIII.,CXLVIII.
5874,CXLVIII.,
5875,CXLVIII.,"And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,"
5876,CXLVIII.,"Hushed as the babe upon its mother's breast,"
5877,CXLVIII.,"Drooped as the willow when no winds can breathe,"
5878,CXLVIII.,"Lulled like the depth of Ocean when at rest,"
5879,CXLVIII.,"Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,"
5880,CXLVIII.,Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;[bp]
5881,CXLVIII.,"In short, he was a very pretty fellow,"
5882,CXLVIII.,Although his woes had turned him rather yellow.
5883,CXLVIII.,
5884,CXLIX.,CXLIX.
5885,CXLIX.,
5886,CXLIX.,"He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,"
5887,CXLIX.,But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
5888,CXLIX.,"Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain"
5889,CXLIX.,Had further sleep a further pleasure made:
5890,CXLIX.,For Woman's face was never formed in vain
5891,CXLIX.,"For Juan, so that even when he prayed"
5892,CXLIX.,"He turned from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,"
5893,CXLIX.,To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.
5894,CXLIX.,
5895,CL.,CL.
5896,CL.,
5897,CL.,"And thus upon his elbow he arose,"
5898,CL.,"And looked upon the lady, in whose cheek"
5899,CL.,"The pale contended with the purple rose,"
5900,CL.,As with an effort she began to speak;
5901,CL.,"Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,"
5902,CL.,"Although she told him, in good modern Greek,"
5903,CL.,"With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,"
5904,CL.,"That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat."
5905,CL.,
5906,CLI.,CLI.
5907,CLI.,
5908,CLI.,"Now Juan could not understand a word,"
5909,CLI.,"Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,"
5910,CLI.,"And her voice was the warble of a bird,[155]"
5911,CLI.,"So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,"
5912,CLI.,"That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;[bq]"
5913,CLI.,"The sort of sound we echo with a tear,"
5914,CLI.,"Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,"
5915,CLI.,Whence Melody descends as from a throne.
5916,CLI.,
5917,CLII.,CLII.
5918,CLII.,
5919,CLII.,And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
5920,CLII.,"By a distant organ, doubting if he be"
5921,CLII.,"Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke"
5922,CLII.,"By the watchman, or some such reality,"
5923,CLII.,Or by one's early valet's curséd knock;
5924,CLII.,"At least it is a heavy sound to me,"
5925,CLII.,Who like a morning slumber--for the night
5926,CLII.,Shows stars and women in a better light.
5927,CLII.,
5928,CLIII.,CLIII.
5929,CLIII.,
5930,CLIII.,"And Juan, too, was helped out from his dream,"
5931,CLIII.,"Or sleep, or whatsoe'er it was, by feeling"
5932,CLIII.,A most prodigious appetite; the steam
5933,CLIII.,Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
5934,CLIII.,"Upon his senses, and the kindling beam"
5935,CLIII.,"Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling,"
5936,CLIII.,"To stir her viands, made him quite awake"
5937,CLIII.,"And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak."
5938,CLIII.,
5939,CLIV.,CLIV.
5940,CLIV.,
5941,CLIV.,But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
5942,CLIV.,"Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton,"
5943,CLIV.,"And, when a holiday upon them smiles,"
5944,CLIV.,A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
5945,CLIV.,"But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,"
5946,CLIV.,For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
5947,CLIV.,"Others are fair and fertile, among which"
5948,CLIV.,"This, though not large, was one of the most rich."
5949,CLIV.,
5950,CLV.,CLV.
5951,CLV.,
5952,CLV.,"I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking"
5953,CLV.,That the old fable of the Minotaur--From
5954,CLV.,"which our modern morals, rightly shrinking,"
5955,CLV.,Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
5956,CLV.,A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking
5957,CLV.,"The allegory) a mere type, no more,"
5958,CLV.,"That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,"
5959,CLV.,To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.
5960,CLV.,
5961,CLVI.,CLVI.
5962,CLVI.,
5963,CLVI.,For we all know that English people are
5964,CLVI.,"Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,"
5965,CLVI.,"Because 't is liquor only, and being far"
5966,CLVI.,"From this my subject, has no business here;"
5967,CLVI.,"We know, too, they are very fond of war,"
5968,CLVI.,A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;
5969,CLVI.,"So were the Cretans--from which I infer,"
5970,CLVI.,That beef and battles both were owing to her.
5971,CLVI.,
5972,CLVII.,CLVII.
5973,CLVII.,
5974,CLVII.,But to resume. The languid Juan raised
5975,CLVII.,"His head upon his elbow, and he saw"
5976,CLVII.,"A sight on which he had not lately gazed,"
5977,CLVII.,"As all his latter meals had been quite raw,"
5978,CLVII.,"Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,"
5979,CLVII.,"And, feeling still the famished vulture gnaw,"
5980,CLVII.,"He fell upon whate'er was offered, like"
5981,CLVII.,"A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike."
5982,CLVII.,
5983,CLVIII.,CLVIII.
5984,CLVIII.,
5985,CLVIII.,"He ate, and he was well supplied; and she,"
5986,CLVIII.,"Who watched him like a mother, would have fed"
5987,CLVIII.,"Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see"
5988,CLVIII.,Such appetite in one she had deemed dead:
5989,CLVIII.,"But Zoe, being older than Haidée,"
5990,CLVIII.,"Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)"
5991,CLVIII.,"That famished people must be slowly nurst,"
5992,CLVIII.,"And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst."
5993,CLVIII.,
5994,CLIX.,CLIX.
5995,CLIX.,
5996,CLIX.,"And so she took the liberty to state,"
5997,CLIX.,"Rather by deeds than words, because the case"
5998,CLIX.,"Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate"
5999,CLIX.,Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
6000,CLIX.,"The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,"
6001,CLIX.,Unless he wished to die upon the place--
6002,CLIX.,"She snatched it, and refused another morsel,"
6003,CLIX.,"Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill."
6004,CLIX.,
6005,CLX.,CLX.
6006,CLX.,
6007,CLX.,"Next they--he being naked, save a tattered"
6008,CLX.,"Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,"
6009,CLX.,"And in the fire his recent rags they scattered,"
6010,CLX.,"And dressed him, for the present, like a Turk,"
6011,CLX.,"Or Greek--that is, although it not much mattered,"
6012,CLX.,"Omitting turban, slippers, pistol, dirk,--"
6013,CLX.,"They furnished him, entire, except some stitches,"
6014,CLX.,"With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches."
6015,CLX.,
6016,CLXI.,CLXI.
6017,CLXI.,
6018,CLXI.,"And then fair Haidée tried her tongue at speaking,"
6019,CLXI.,"But not a word could Juan comprehend,"
6020,CLXI.,Although he listened so that the young Greek in
6021,CLXI.,Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
6022,CLXI.,"And, as he interrupted not, went eking"
6023,CLXI.,"Her speech out to her protégé and friend,"
6024,CLXI.,"Till pausing at the last her breath to take,"
6025,CLXI.,She saw he did not understand Romaic.
6026,CLXI.,
6027,CLXII.,CLXII.
6028,CLXII.,
6029,CLXII.,"And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,"
6030,CLXII.,"And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,"
6031,CLXII.,And read (the only book she could) the lines
6032,CLXII.,"Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,"
6033,CLXII.,"The answer eloquent, where the Soul shines"
6034,CLXII.,And darts in one quick glance a long reply;
6035,CLXII.,And thus in every look she saw expressed
6036,CLXII.,"A world of words, and things at which she guessed."
6037,CLXII.,
6038,CLXIII.,CLXIII.
6039,CLXIII.,
6040,CLXIII.,"And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,"
6041,CLXIII.,"And words repeated after her, he took"
6042,CLXIII.,"A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,"
6043,CLXIII.,"No doubt, less of her language than her look:"
6044,CLXIII.,As he who studies fervently the skies
6045,CLXIII.,"Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,"
6046,CLXIII.,Thus Juan learned his _alpha beta_ better
6047,CLXIII.,From Haidée's glance than any graven letter.
6048,CLXIII.,
6049,CLXIV.,CLXIV.
6050,CLXIV.,
6051,CLXIV.,'T is pleasing to be schooled in a strange tongue
6052,CLXIV.,"By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,"
6053,CLXIV.,"When both the teacher and the taught are young,"
6054,CLXIV.,"As was the case, at least, where I have been;[156]"
6055,CLXIV.,"They smile so when one's right, and when one's wrong"
6056,CLXIV.,"They smile still more, and then there intervene"
6057,CLXIV.,"Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--[br]"
6058,CLXIV.,I learned the little that I know by this:
6059,CLXIV.,
6060,CLXV.,CLXV.
6061,CLXV.,
6062,CLXV.,"That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,"
6063,CLXV.,"Italian not at all, having no teachers;[bs]"
6064,CLXV.,"Much English I cannot pretend to speak,"
6065,CLXV.,"Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,"
6066,CLXV.,"Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week"
6067,CLXV.,"I study, also Blair--the highest reachers"
6068,CLXV.,Of eloquence in piety and prose--
6069,CLXV.,"I hate your poets, so read none of those."
6070,CLXV.,
6071,CLXVI.,CLXVI.
6072,CLXVI.,
6073,CLXVI.,"As for the ladies, I have nought to say,"
6074,CLXVI.,"A wanderer from the British world of Fashion,[157]"
6075,CLXVI.,"Where I, like other ""dogs, have had my day,"""
6076,CLXVI.,"Like other men, too, may have had my passion--"
6077,CLXVI.,"But that, like other things, has passed away,"
6078,CLXVI.,And all her fools whom I _could_ lay the lash on:
6079,CLXVI.,"Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me"
6080,CLXVI.,"But dreams of what has been, no more to be.[bt]"
6081,CLXVI.,
6082,CLXVII.,CLXVII.
6083,CLXVII.,
6084,CLXVII.,Return we to Don Juan. He begun[158]
6085,CLXVII.,"To hear new words, and to repeat them; but"
6086,CLXVII.,"Some feelings, universal as the Sun,"
6087,CLXVII.,Were such as could not in his breast be shut
6088,CLXVII.,More than within the bosom of a nun:
6089,CLXVII.,"He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,"
6090,CLXVII.,"With a young benefactress,--so was she,"
6091,CLXVII.,Just in the way we very often see.
6092,CLXVII.,
6093,CLXVIII.,CLXVIII.
6094,CLXVIII.,
6095,CLXVIII.,And every day by daybreak--rather early
6096,CLXVIII.,"For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--"
6097,CLXVIII.,"She came into the cave, but it was merely"
6098,CLXVIII.,To see her bird reposing in his nest;[159]
6099,CLXVIII.,"And she would softly stir his locks so curly,"
6100,CLXVIII.,"Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,"
6101,CLXVIII.,"Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,[bu]"
6102,CLXVIII.,As o'er a bed of roses the sweet South.
6103,CLXVIII.,
6104,CLXIX.,CLXIX.
6105,CLXIX.,
6106,CLXIX.,"And every morn his colour freshlier came,"
6107,CLXIX.,And every day helped on his convalescence;
6108,CLXIX.,"'T was well, because health in the human frame"
6109,CLXIX.,"Is pleasant, besides being true Love's essence,"
6110,CLXIX.,For health and idleness to Passion's flame
6111,CLXIX.,Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
6112,CLXIX.,"Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,"
6113,CLXIX.,Without whom Venus will not long attack us.[160]
6114,CLXIX.,
6115,CLXX.,CLXX.
6116,CLXX.,
6117,CLXX.,"While Venus fills the heart, (without heart really"
6118,CLXX.,"Love, though good always, is not quite so good,)"
6119,CLXX.,"Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--"
6120,CLXX.,"For Love must be sustained like flesh and blood,--While"
6121,CLXX.,"Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:"
6122,CLXX.,"Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;[bv]"
6123,CLXX.,But who is their purveyor from above
6124,CLXX.,"Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove."
6125,CLXX.,
6126,CLXXI.,CLXXI.
6127,CLXXI.,
6128,CLXXI.,"When Juan woke he found some good things ready,"
6129,CLXXI.,"A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes"
6130,CLXXI.,"That ever made a youthful heart less steady,"
6131,CLXXI.,"Besides her maid's, as pretty for their size;"
6132,CLXXI.,But I have spoken of all this already--
6133,CLXXI.,"A repetition's tiresome and unwise,--"
6134,CLXXI.,"Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,"
6135,CLXXI.,Came always back to coffee and Haidée.
6136,CLXXI.,
6137,CLXXII.,CLXXII.
6138,CLXXII.,
6139,CLXXII.,"Both were so young, and one so innocent,"
6140,CLXXII.,That bathing passed for nothing; Juan seemed
6141,CLXXII.,"To her, as 't were, the kind of being sent,"
6142,CLXXII.,"Of whom these two years she had nightly dreamed,"
6143,CLXXII.,"A something to be loved, a creature meant"
6144,CLXXII.,"To be her happiness, and whom she deemed"
6145,CLXXII.,To render happy; all who joy would win
6146,CLXXII.,"Must share it,--Happiness was born a Twin."
6147,CLXXII.,
6148,CLXXIII.,CLXXIII.
6149,CLXXIII.,
6150,CLXXIII.,"It was such pleasure to behold him, such"
6151,CLXXIII.,Enlargement of existence to partake
6152,CLXXIII.,"Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,"
6153,CLXXIII.,"To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:"
6154,CLXXIII.,To live with him for ever were too much;
6155,CLXXIII.,But then the thought of parting made her quake;
6156,CLXXIII.,"He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast"
6157,CLXXIII.,"Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.[bw]"
6158,CLXXIII.,
6159,CLXXIV.,CLXXIV.
6160,CLXXIV.,
6161,CLXXIV.,"And thus a moon rolled on, and fair Haidée"
6162,CLXXIV.,"Paid daily visits to her boy, and took"
6163,CLXXIV.,"Such plentiful precautions, that still he"
6164,CLXXIV.,Remained unknown within his craggy nook;
6165,CLXXIV.,"At last her father's prows put out to sea,"
6166,CLXXIV.,"For certain merchantmen upon the look,"
6167,CLXXIV.,"Not as of yore to carry off an Io,"
6168,CLXXIV.,"But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio."
6169,CLXXIV.,
6170,CLXXV.,CLXXV.
6171,CLXXV.,
6172,CLXXV.,"Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,"
6173,CLXXV.,"So that, her father being at sea, she was"
6174,CLXXV.,"Free as a married woman, or such other"
6175,CLXXV.,"Female, as where she likes may freely pass,"
6176,CLXXV.,"Without even the encumbrance of a brother,"
6177,CLXXV.,The freest she that ever gazed on glass:
6178,CLXXV.,"I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,"
6179,CLXXV.,"Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison."
6180,CLXXV.,
6181,CLXXVI.,CLXXVI.
6182,CLXXVI.,
6183,CLXXVI.,Now she prolonged her visits and her talk
6184,CLXXVI.,"(For they must talk), and he had learnt to say"
6185,CLXXVI.,"So much as to propose to take a walk,--"
6186,CLXXVI.,For little had he wandered since the day
6187,CLXXVI.,"On which, like a young flower snapped from the stalk,"
6188,CLXXVI.,"Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--"
6189,CLXXVI.,"And thus they walked out in the afternoon,"
6190,CLXXVI.,And saw the sun set opposite the moon.[bx]
6191,CLXXVI.,
6192,CLXXVII.,CLXXVII.
6193,CLXXVII.,
6194,CLXXVII.,"It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,"
6195,CLXXVII.,"With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,"
6196,CLXXVII.,"Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,"
6197,CLXXVII.,"With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore"
6198,CLXXVII.,A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
6199,CLXXVII.,"And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,"
6200,CLXXVII.,"Save on the dead long summer days, which make"
6201,CLXXVII.,The outstretched Ocean glitter like a lake.
6202,CLXXVII.,
6203,CLXXVIII.,CLXXVIII.
6204,CLXXVIII.,
6205,CLXXVIII.,And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
6206,CLXXVIII.,"Scarcely o'erpassed the cream of your champagne,"
6207,CLXXVIII.,"When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,"
6208,CLXXVIII.,That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
6209,CLXXVIII.,Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
6210,CLXXVIII.,"Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--"
6211,CLXXVIII.,"Let us have Wine and Woman,[161] Mirth and Laughter,"
6212,CLXXVIII.,Sermons and soda-water the day after.
6213,CLXXVIII.,
6214,CLXXIX.,CLXXIX.
6215,CLXXIX.,
6216,CLXXIX.,"Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;"
6217,CLXXIX.,The best of Life is but intoxication:
6218,CLXXIX.,"Glory, the Grape, Love, Gold, in these are sunk"
6219,CLXXIX.,"The hopes of all men, and of every nation;"
6220,CLXXIX.,"Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk"
6221,CLXXIX.,"Of Life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion!"
6222,CLXXIX.,"But to return,--Get very drunk, and when"

6225,CLXXX.,CLXXX.
6226,CLXXX.,
6227,CLXXX.,Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring
6228,CLXXX.,"Some hock and soda-water,[162] then you'll know"
6229,CLXXX.,A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
6230,CLXXX.,"For not the blest sherbet, sublimed with snow,[163]"
6231,CLXXX.,"Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,"
6232,CLXXX.,"Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,[by]"
6233,CLXXX.,"After long travel, Ennui, Love, or Slaughter,"

6238,CLXXXI.,The coast--I think it was the coast that I
6239,CLXXXI.,"Was just describing--Yes, it _was_ the coast--"
6240,CLXXXI.,"Lay at this period quiet as the sky,"
6241,CLXXXI.,"The sands untumbled, the blue waves untossed,"
6242,CLXXXI.,"And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,"
6243,CLXXXI.,"And dolphin's leap, and little billow crossed"
6244,CLXXXI.,"By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret"
6245,CLXXXI.,Against the boundary it scarcely wet.
6246,CLXXXI.,
6247,CLXXXII.,CLXXXII.
6248,CLXXXII.,
6249,CLXXXII.,"And forth they wandered, her sire being gone,"
6250,CLXXXII.,"As I have said, upon an expedition;"
6251,CLXXXII.,"And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,"
6252,CLXXXII.,"Save Zoe, who, although with due precision"
6253,CLXXXII.,"She waited on her lady with the Sun,"
6254,CLXXXII.,"Thought daily service was her only mission,"
6255,CLXXXII.,"Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,"
6256,CLXXXII.,And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.

6304,CLXXXVII.,By length I mean duration; theirs endured

6319,CLXXXVIII.,"The voiceless sands, and dropping caves, that lay"

6323,CLXXXVIII.,
6324,CLXXXIX.,CLXXXIX.
6325,CLXXXIX.,
6326,CLXXXIX.,They feared no eyes nor ears on that lone beach;
6327,CLXXXIX.,They felt no terrors from the night; they were
6328,CLXXXIX.,All in all to each other: though their speech
6329,CLXXXIX.,"Was broken words, they _thought_ a language there,--"
6330,CLXXXIX.,And all the burning tongues the Passions teach[cb]
6331,CLXXXIX.,Found in one sigh the best interpreter

6341,CXC.,"She was all which pure Ignorance allows,"
6342,CXC.,And flew to her young mate like a young bird;

6346,CXCI.,CXCI.

6351,CXCI.,"If souls could die, had perished in that passion,--"
6352,CXCI.,"But by degrees their senses were restored,"
6353,CXCI.,"Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;"
6354,CXCI.,"And, beating 'gainst _his_ bosom, Haidée's heart"

6358,CXCII.,
6359,CXCII.,"Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,"

6363,CXCII.,"Prompts deeds Eternity can not annul,"
6364,CXCII.,But pays off moments in an endless shower

6374,CXCIII.,"And Haidée, being devout as well as fair,"
6375,CXCIII.,"Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,"

6385,CXCIV.,"She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,"

7809,XLIX.,If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
7810,XLIX.,"For Haidée's sake, is more than I can say,"

7887,LVI.,A pleasure in the gentle stream that flowed
7888,LVI.,"Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,"

7895,LVII.,The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
7896,LVII.,"Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen,"
7897,LVII.,A lonely pure affection unopposed:

9355,VII.,"But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;"
9356,VII.,"This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:"
9357,VII.,"Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,"
9358,VII.,And tells me to resume my story here.[234]
9359,VII.,
9360,VIII.,VIII.
9361,VIII.,
9362,VIII.,Young Juan and his lady-love were left
9363,VIII.,To their own hearts' most sweet society;
9364,VIII.,Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
9365,VIII.,With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
9366,VIII.,"Sighed to behold them of their hours bereft,"
9367,VIII.,Though foe to Love; and yet they could not be
9368,VIII.,"Meant to grow old, but die in happy Spring,"
9369,VIII.,Before one charm or hope had taken wing.
9370,VIII.,
9371,IX.,IX.
9372,IX.,
9373,IX.,"Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their"
9374,IX.,"Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;"
9375,IX.,"The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,"
9376,IX.,"But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail,"
9377,IX.,They were all summer; lightning might assail
9378,IX.,"And shiver them to ashes, but to trail"
9379,IX.,A long and snake-like life of dull decay
9380,IX.,Was not for them--they had too little clay.
9381,IX.,
9382,X.,X.
9383,X.,
9384,X.,They were alone once more; for them to be
9385,X.,Thus was another Eden; they were never
9386,X.,"Weary, unless when separate: the tree"
9387,X.,Cut from its forest root of years--the river
9388,X.,Dammed from its fountain--the child from the knee
9389,X.,"And breast maternal weaned at once for ever,--"
9390,X.,Would wither less than these two torn apart;[dk]
9391,X.,Alas! there is no instinct like the Heart--
9392,X.,
9393,XI.,XI.
9394,XI.,
9395,XI.,The Heart--which may be broken: happy they!
9396,XI.,"Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,"
9397,XI.,"The precious porcelain of human clay,"
9398,XI.,Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
9399,XI.,"The long year linked with heavy day on day,"
9400,XI.,"And all which must be borne, and never told;"
9401,XI.,While Life's strange principle will often lie
9402,XI.,Deepest in those who long the most to die.
9403,XI.,
9404,XII.,XII.
9405,XII.,
9406,XII.,"""Whom the gods love die young,"" was said of yore,[235]"
9407,XII.,And many deaths do they escape by this:
9408,XII.,"The death of friends, and that which slays even more--"
9409,XII.,"The death of Friendship, Love, Youth, all that is,"
9410,XII.,Except mere breath; and since the silent shore
9411,XII.,Awaits at last even those who longest miss
9412,XII.,"The old Archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave[236]"
9413,XII.,Which men weep over may be meant to save.
9414,XII.,
9415,XIII.,XIII.
9416,XIII.,
9417,XIII.,Haidée and Juan thought not of the dead--
9418,XIII.,"The Heavens, and Earth, and Air, seemed made for them:"
9419,XIII.,"They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;"
9420,XIII.,They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
9421,XIII.,"Each was the other's mirror, and but read"
9422,XIII.,Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem.
9423,XIII.,And knew such brightness was but the reflection
9424,XIII.,Of their exchanging glances of affection.
9425,XIII.,
9426,XIV.,XIV.
9427,XIV.,
9428,XIV.,"The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,"
9429,XIV.,"The least glance better understood than words,"
9430,XIV.,"Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;"
9431,XIV.,"A language,[237] too, but like to that of birds,"
9432,XIV.,"Known but to them, at least appearing such"
9433,XIV.,As but to lovers a true sense affords;
9434,XIV.,"Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd"
9435,XIV.,"To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard--"
9436,XIV.,
9437,XV.,XV.
9438,XV.,
9439,XV.,"All these were theirs, for they were children still,"
9440,XV.,And children still they should have ever been;
9441,XV.,They were not made in the real world to fill
9442,XV.,"A busy character in the dull scene,"
9443,XV.,"But like two beings born from out a rill,"
9444,XV.,"A Nymph and her belovéd, all unseen"
9445,XV.,"To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,"
9446,XV.,And never know the weight of human hours.
9447,XV.,
9448,XVI.,XVI.
9449,XVI.,
9450,XVI.,"Moons changing had rolled on, and changeless found"
9451,XVI.,Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
9452,XVI.,As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
9453,XVI.,"And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,"
9454,XVI.,"For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound"
9455,XVI.,By the mere senses; and that which destroys[dl]
9456,XVI.,Most love--possession--unto them appeared
9457,XVI.,A thing which each endearment more endeared.
9458,XVI.,
9459,XVII.,XVII.
9460,XVII.,
9461,XVII.,Oh beautiful! and rare as beautiful!
9462,XVII.,But theirs was Love in which the Mind delights
9463,XVII.,"To lose itself, when the old world grows dull,"
9464,XVII.,"And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,"
9465,XVII.,"Intrigues, adventures of the common school,"
9466,XVII.,"Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,"
9467,XVII.,"Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,"
9468,XVII.,Whose husband only knows her not a whore.
9469,XVII.,
9470,XVIII.,XVIII.
9471,XVIII.,
9472,XVIII.,Hard words--harsh truth! a truth which many know.
9473,XVIII.,"Enough.--The faithful and the fairy pair,"
9474,XVIII.,"Who never found a single hour too slow,"
9475,XVIII.,What was it made them thus exempt from care?
9476,XVIII.,"Young innate feelings all have felt below,"
9477,XVIII.,"Which perish in the rest, but in them were"
9478,XVIII.,"Inherent--what we mortals call romantic,"
9479,XVIII.,"And always envy, though we deem it frantic."
9480,XVIII.,
9481,XIX.,XIX.
9482,XIX.,
9483,XIX.,"This is in others a factitious state,"
9484,XIX.,"An opium dream[238] of too much youth and reading,"
9485,XIX.,But was in them their nature or their fate:
9486,XIX.,"No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,[dm]"
9487,XIX.,"For Haidée's knowledge was by no means great,"
9488,XIX.,And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;
9489,XIX.,So that there was no reason for their loves
9490,XIX.,More than for those of nightingales or doves.
9491,XIX.,
9492,XX.,XX.
9493,XX.,
9494,XX.,They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
9495,XX.,"Dear unto all, but dearest to _their_ eyes,"
9496,XX.,For it had made them what they were: the power
9497,XX.,"Of Love had first o'erwhelmed them from such skies,"
9498,XX.,"When Happiness had been their only dower,"
9499,XX.,And Twilight saw them linked in Passion's ties;
9500,XX.,"Charmed with each other, all things charmed that brought"
9501,XX.,The past still welcome as the present thought.
9502,XX.,
9503,XXI.,XXI.
9504,XXI.,
9505,XXI.,"I know not why, but in that hour to-night,"
9506,XXI.,"Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,"
9507,XXI.,"And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,"
9508,XXI.,"Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,"
9509,XXI.,"When one is shook in sound, and one in sight:"
9510,XXI.,"And thus some boding flashed through either frame,"
9511,XXI.,"And called from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,"
9512,XXI.,While one new tear arose in Haidée's eye.
9513,XXI.,
9514,XXII.,XXII.
9515,XXII.,
9516,XXII.,That large black prophet eye seemed to dilate
9517,XXII.,"And follow far the disappearing sun,"
9518,XXII.,As if their last day of a happy date
9519,XXII.,"With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;"
9520,XXII.,Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate--
9521,XXII.,"He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,"
9522,XXII.,His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
9523,XXII.,"For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse."
9524,XXII.,
9525,XXIII.,XXIII.
9526,XXIII.,
9527,XXIII.,"She turned to him, and smiled, but in that sort"
9528,XXIII.,Which makes not others smile; then turned aside:
9529,XXIII.,"Whatever feeling shook her, it seemed short,"
9530,XXIII.,And mastered by her wisdom or her pride;
9531,XXIII.,"When Juan spoke, too--it might be in sport--"
9532,XXIII.,"Of this their mutual feeling, she replied--"
9533,XXIII.,"""If it should be so,--but--it cannot be--"
9534,XXIII.,"Or I at least shall not survive to see."""
9535,XXIII.,
9536,XXIV.,XXIV.
9537,XXIV.,
9538,XXIV.,"Juan would question further, but she pressed"
9539,XXIV.,"His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,"
9540,XXIV.,"And then dismissed the omen from her breast,"
9541,XXIV.,Defying augury with that fond kiss;
9542,XXIV.,And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
9543,XXIV.,Some people prefer wine--'t is not amiss;
9544,XXIV.,I have tried both--so those who would a part take
9545,XXIV.,May choose between the headache and the heartache.
9546,XXIV.,
9547,XXV.,XXV.
9548,XXV.,
9549,XXV.,"One of the two, according to your choice,"
9550,XXV.,"Woman or wine, you'll have to undergo;"
9551,XXV.,Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
9552,XXV.,"But which to choose, I really hardly know;"
9553,XXV.,"And if I had to give a casting voice,"
9554,XXV.,"For both sides I could many reasons show,"
9555,XXV.,"And then decide, without great wrong to either,"
9556,XXV.,It were much better to have both than neither.
9557,XXV.,
9558,XXVI.,XXVI.
9559,XXVI.,
9560,XXVI.,Juan and Haidée gazed upon each other
9561,XXVI.,"With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,"
9562,XXVI.,"Which mixed all feelings--friend, child, lover, brother--"
9563,XXVI.,All that the best can mingle and express
9564,XXVI.,"When two pure hearts are poured in one another,"
9565,XXVI.,"And love too much, and yet can not love less;"
9566,XXVI.,But almost sanctify the sweet excess
9567,XXVI.,By the immortal wish and power to bless.
9568,XXVI.,
9569,XXVII.,XXVII.
9570,XXVII.,
9571,XXVII.,"Mixed in each other's arms, and heart in heart,"
9572,XXVII.,Why did they not then die?--they had lived too long
9573,XXVII.,Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
9574,XXVII.,Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;
9575,XXVII.,The World was not for them--nor the World's art
9576,XXVII.,For beings passionate as Sappho's song;
9577,XXVII.,"Love was born _with_ them, _in_ them, so intense,"
9578,XXVII.,It was their very Spirit--not a sense.
9579,XXVII.,
9580,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
9581,XXVIII.,
9582,XXVIII.,"They should have lived together deep in woods,"
9583,XXVIII.,Unseen as sings the nightingale;[239] they were
9584,XXVIII.,Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes
9585,XXVIII.,"Called social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:[dn]"
9586,XXVIII.,How lonely every freeborn creature broods!
9587,XXVIII.,The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
9588,XXVIII.,The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow
9589,XXVIII.,"Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below."
9590,XXVIII.,
9591,XXIX.,XXIX.
9592,XXIX.,
9593,XXIX.,"Now pillowed cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,"
9594,XXIX.,"Haidée and Juan their siesta took,"
9595,XXIX.,"A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,"
9596,XXIX.,For ever and anon a something shook
9597,XXIX.,"Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;"
9598,XXIX.,And Haidée's sweet lips murmured like a brook
9599,XXIX.,"A wordless music, and her face so fair"
9600,XXIX.,"Stirred with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.[do]"
9601,XXIX.,
9602,XXX.,XXX.
9603,XXX.,
9604,XXX.,Or as the stirring of a deep clear stream
9605,XXX.,"Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind"
9606,XXX.,"Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,"
9607,XXX.,The mystical Usurper of the mind--
9608,XXX.,O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem
9609,XXX.,Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
9610,XXX.,Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
9611,XXX.,"Senseless to feel, and with sealed eyes to see.[dp]"
9612,XXX.,
9613,XXXI.,XXXI.
9614,XXXI.,
9615,XXXI.,"She dreamed of being alone on the sea-shore,"
9616,XXXI.,"Chained to a rock; she knew not how, but stir"
9617,XXXI.,"She could not from the spot, and the loud roar"
9618,XXXI.,"Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;"
9619,XXXI.,"And o'er her upper lip they seemed to pour,"
9620,XXXI.,"Until she sobbed for breath, and soon they were"
9621,XXXI.,"Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high--"
9622,XXXI.,"Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die."
9623,XXXI.,
9624,XXXII.,XXXII.
9625,XXXII.,
9626,XXXII.,"Anon--she was released, and then she strayed"
9627,XXXII.,"O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,"
9628,XXXII.,And stumbled almost every step she made:
9629,XXXII.,"And something rolled before her in a sheet,"
9630,XXXII.,Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
9631,XXXII.,"'T was white and indistinct, nor stopped to meet"
9632,XXXII.,"Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed and grasped,"
9633,XXXII.,"And ran, but it escaped her as she clasped."
9634,XXXII.,
9635,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
9636,XXXIII.,
9637,XXXIII.,"The dream changed:--in a cave[240] she stood, its walls"
9638,XXXIII.,Were hung with marble icicles; the work
9639,XXXIII.,"Of ages on its water-fretted halls,"
9640,XXXIII.,"Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;"
9641,XXXIII.,"Her hair was dripping, and the very balls"
9642,XXXIII.,"Of her black eyes seemed turned to tears, and mirk"
9643,XXXIII.,"The sharp rocks looked below each drop they caught,"
9644,XXXIII.,"Which froze to marble as it fell,--she thought.[dq]"
9645,XXXIII.,
9646,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
9647,XXXIV.,
9648,XXXIV.,"And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,"
9649,XXXIV.,"Pale as the foam that frothed on his dead brow,"
9650,XXXIV.,"Which she essayed in vain to clear, (how sweet"
9651,XXXIV.,"Were once her cares, how idle seemed they now!)"
9652,XXXIV.,"Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat"
9653,XXXIV.,Of his quenched heart: and the sea dirges low
9654,XXXIV.,"Rang in her sad ears like a Mermaid's song,"
9655,XXXIV.,And that brief dream appeared a life too long.
9656,XXXIV.,
9657,XXXV.,XXXV.
9658,XXXV.,
9659,XXXV.,"And gazing on the dead, she thought his face"
9660,XXXV.,"Faded, or altered into something new--"
9661,XXXV.,"Like to her Father's features, till each trace"
9662,XXXV.,More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew--
9663,XXXV.,With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
9664,XXXV.,"And starting, she awoke, and what to view?"
9665,XXXV.,Oh! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?
9666,XXXV.,'T is--'t is her Father's--fixed upon the pair!
9667,XXXV.,
9668,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
9669,XXXVI.,
9670,XXXVI.,"Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,"
9671,XXXVI.,"With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see"
9672,XXXVI.,Him whom she deemed a habitant where dwell
9673,XXXVI.,"The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be"
9674,XXXVI.,Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
9675,XXXVI.,"Dear as her father had been to Haidée,"
9676,XXXVI.,It was a moment of that awful kind--
9677,XXXVI.,I have seen such--but must not call to mind.
9678,XXXVI.,
9679,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
9680,XXXVII.,
9681,XXXVII.,"Up Juan sprang to Haidée's bitter shriek,"
9682,XXXVII.,"And caught her falling, and from off the wall"
9683,XXXVII.,"Snatched down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak"
9684,XXXVII.,Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:
9685,XXXVII.,"Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,"
9686,XXXVII.,"Smiled scornfully, and said, ""Within my call,"
9687,XXXVII.,A thousand scimitars await the word;
9688,XXXVII.,"Put up, young man, put up your silly sword."""
9689,XXXVII.,
9690,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
9691,XXXVIII.,
9692,XXXVIII.,"And Haidée clung around him; ""Juan, 't is--"
9693,XXXVIII.,'T is Lambro--'t is my father! Kneel with me--
9694,XXXVIII.,He will forgive us--yes--it must be--yes.
9695,XXXVIII.,"Oh! dearest father, in this agony"
9696,XXXVIII.,Of pleasure and of pain--even while I kiss
9697,XXXVIII.,"Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be"
9698,XXXVIII.,That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?
9699,XXXVIII.,"Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy."""
9700,XXXVIII.,
9701,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
9702,XXXIX.,
9703,XXXIX.,"High and inscrutable the old man stood,"
9704,XXXIX.,"Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye--"
9705,XXXIX.,Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
9706,XXXIX.,"He looked upon her, but gave no reply;"
9707,XXXIX.,"Then turned to Juan, in whose cheek the blood"
9708,XXXIX.,"Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;"
9709,XXXIX.,"In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring"
9710,XXXIX.,On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.
9711,XXXIX.,
9712,XL.,XL.
9713,XL.,
9714,XL.,"""Young man, your sword;"" so Lambro once more said:"
9715,XL.,"Juan replied, ""Not while this arm is free."""
9716,XL.,"The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,"
9717,XL.,And drawing from his belt a pistol he
9718,XL.,"Replied, ""Your blood be then on your own head."""
9719,XL.,"Then looked close at the flint, as if to see"
9720,XL.,'T was fresh--for he had lately used the lock--
9721,XL.,And next proceeded quietly to cock.
9722,XL.,
9723,XLI.,XLI.
9724,XLI.,
9725,XLI.,"It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,"
9726,XLI.,"That cocking of a pistol, when you know"
9727,XLI.,A moment more will bring the sight to bear
9728,XLI.,"Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;"
9729,XLI.,"A gentlemanly distance, not too near,"
9730,XLI.,If you have got a former friend for foe;
9731,XLI.,"But after being fired at once or twice,"
9732,XLI.,"The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice."
9733,XLI.,
9734,XLII.,XLII.
9735,XLII.,
9736,XLII.,"Lambro presented, and one instant more"
9737,XLII.,"Had stopped this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,"

9739,XLII.,"Stern as her sire: ""On me,"" she cried, ""let Death"
9740,XLII.,Descend--the fault is mine; this fatal shore
9741,XLII.,He found--but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
9742,XLII.,I love him--I will die with him: I knew

9744,XLII.,
9745,XLIII.,XLIII.
9746,XLIII.,
9747,XLIII.,"A minute past, and she had been all tears,"

9749,XLIII.,She stood as one who championed human fears--
9750,XLIII.,"Pale, statue-like, and stern, she wooed the blow;"
9751,XLIII.,"And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,"
9752,XLIII.,"She drew up to her height, as if to show"
9753,XLIII.,A fairer mark; and with a fixed eye scanned
9754,XLIII.,Her Father's face--but never stopped his hand.
9755,XLIII.,
9756,XLIV.,XLIV.
9757,XLIV.,
9758,XLIV.,"He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange"

9760,XLIV.,"Serenely savage, with a little change"
9761,XLIV.,In the large dark eye's mutual--darted flame;
9762,XLIV.,"For she, too, was as one who could avenge,"
9763,XLIV.,"If cause should be--a Lioness, though tame."
9764,XLIV.,Her Father's blood before her Father's face
9765,XLIV.,"Boiled up, and proved her truly of his race."

9774,XLV.,"In fixed ferocity, when joyous tears"

11731,LXIII.,Who give themselves to Architecture wholly;
11732,LXIII.,We know where things and men must end at best:
11733,LXIII.,"A moral (like all morals) melancholy,"
11734,LXIII.,"And ""Et sepulchri immemor struis domos"""
11735,LXIII.,Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.

11739,LXIV.,"At last they reached a quarter most retired,"
11740,LXIV.,Where Echo woke as if from a long slumber;
11741,LXIV.,"Though full of all things which could be desired,"
11742,LXIV.,One wondered what to do with such a number
11743,LXIV.,Of articles which nobody required;
11744,LXIV.,Here Wealth had done its utmost to encumber
11745,LXIV.,"With furniture an exquisite apartment,"
11746,LXIV.,Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.
11747,LXIV.,
11748,LXV.,LXV.
11749,LXV.,
11750,LXV.,"It seemed, however, but to open on"
11751,LXV.,"A range or suite of further chambers, which"
11752,LXV.,Might lead to Heaven knows where; but in this one
11753,LXV.,The moveables were prodigally rich:
11754,LXV.,"Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,"
11755,LXV.,So costly were they; carpets every stitch
11756,LXV.,"Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish"
11757,LXV.,You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.
11758,LXV.,
11759,LXVI.,LXVI.
11760,LXVI.,
11761,LXVI.,"The black, however, without hardly deigning"
11762,LXVI.,"A glance at that which wrapped the slaves in wonder,"
11763,LXVI.,"Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,"
11764,LXVI.,As if the milky way their feet was under
11765,LXVI.,With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining
11766,LXVI.,"A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder,"
11767,LXVI.,In that remote recess which you may see--
11768,LXVI.,"Or if you don't the fault is not in me,--"
11769,LXVI.,
11770,LXVII.,LXVII.
11771,LXVII.,
11772,LXVII.,"I wish to be perspicuous--and the black,"
11773,LXVII.,"I say, unlocking the recess, pulled forth"
11774,LXVII.,A quantity of clothes fit for the back
11775,LXVII.,"Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth:"
11776,LXVII.,And of variety there was no lack--
11777,LXVII.,"And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,--"
11778,LXVII.,He chose himself to point out what he thought
11779,LXVII.,Most proper for the Christians he had bought.
11780,LXVII.,
11781,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
11782,LXVIII.,
11783,LXVIII.,The suit he thought most suitable to each
11784,LXVIII.,"Was, for the elder and the stouter, first"
11785,LXVIII.,"A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,"
11786,LXVIII.,"And trousers not so tight that they would burst,"
11787,LXVIII.,But such as fit an Asiatic breech;
11788,LXVIII.,"A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nursed,"
11789,LXVIII.,"Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;"
11790,LXVIII.,"In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy."

11792,LXIX.,LXIX.
11793,LXIX.,
11794,LXIX.,"While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,"
11795,LXIX.,Hinted the vast advantages which they
11796,LXIX.,"Might probably attain both in the end,"
11797,LXIX.,If they would but pursue the proper way
11798,LXIX.,Which Fortune plainly seemed to recommend;
11799,LXIX.,"And then he added, that he needs must say,"
11800,LXIX.,"""'T would greatly tend to better their condition,"

11805,LXX.,"""For his own part, he really should rejoice"

11808,LXX.,"The other, thanking him for this excess"
11809,LXX.,"Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice"
11810,LXX.,"In such a trifle, scarcely could express"
11811,LXX.,"""Sufficiently"" (he said) ""his approbation"

11814,LXXI.,LXXI.
11815,LXXI.,
11816,LXXI.,"""For his own share--he saw but small objection"
11817,LXXI.,To so respectable an ancient rite;
11818,LXXI.,"And, after swallowing down a slight refection,"
11819,LXXI.,"For which he owned a present appetite,"
11820,LXXI.,He doubted not a few hours of reflection
11821,LXXI.,"Would reconcile him to the business quite."""
11822,LXXI.,"""Will it?"" said Juan, sharply: ""Strike me dead,"

11828,LXXII.,"Replied the other, ""do not interrupt:"
11829,LXXII.,You put me out in what I had to say.
11830,LXXII.,"Sir!--as I said, as soon as I have supped,"
11831,LXXII.,I shall perpend if your proposal may
11832,LXXII.,Be such as I can properly accept;

11836,LXXIII.,LXXIII.
11837,LXXIII.,
11838,LXXIII.,"Baba eyed Juan, and said, ""Be so good"
11839,LXXIII.,"As dress yourself--"" and pointed out a suit"
11840,LXXIII.,In which a Princess with great pleasure would
11841,LXXIII.,"Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,"
11842,LXXIII.,"As not being in a masquerading mood,"
11843,LXXIII.,Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;
11844,LXXIII.,"And when the old negro told him to ""Get ready,"""
11845,LXXIII.,"Replied, ""Old gentleman, I'm not a lady."""

11847,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
11848,LXXIV.,
11849,LXXIV.,"""What you may be, I neither know nor care,"""
11850,LXXIV.,"Said Baba; ""but pray do as I desire:"
11851,LXXIV.,"I have no more time nor many words to spare."""
11852,LXXIV.,"""At least,"" said Juan, ""sure I may inquire"
11853,LXXIV.,"The cause of this odd travesty?""--""Forbear,"""
11854,LXXIV.,"Said Baba, ""to be curious; 't will transpire,"
11855,LXXIV.,"No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:"
11856,LXXIV.,"I have no authority to tell the reason."""

11858,LXXV.,LXXV.
11859,LXXV.,
11860,LXXV.,"""Then if I do,"" said Juan, ""I'll be----""--""Hold!"""
11861,LXXV.,"Rejoined the negro, ""pray be not provoking;"
11862,LXXV.,"This spirit's well, but it may wax too bold,"
11863,LXXV.,"And you will find us not too fond of joking."""
11864,LXXV.,"""What, sir!"" said Juan, ""shall it e'er be told"
11865,LXXV.,"That I unsexed my dress?"" But Baba, stroking"
11866,LXXV.,"The things down, said, ""Incense me, and I call"
11867,LXXV.,Those who will leave you of no sex at all.
11868,LXXV.,
11869,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
11870,LXXVI.,
11871,LXXVI.,"""I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:"

11874,LXXVI.,"The effeminate garb?""--thus, after a short pause,"
11875,LXXVI.,"Sighed Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,"
11876,LXXVI.,"""What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?"""
11877,LXXVI.,Thus he profanely termed the finest lace
11878,LXXVI.,Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.
11879,LXXVI.,
11880,LXXVII.,LXXVII.
11881,LXXVII.,
11882,LXXVII.,"And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipped"
11883,LXXVII.,A pair of trousers of flesh-coloured silk;[ff]
11884,LXXVII.,"Next with a virgin zone he was equipped,"
11885,LXXVII.,Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;
11886,LXXVII.,"But tugging on his petticoat, he tripped,"
11887,LXXVII.,"Which--as we say--or as the Scotch say, _whilk_.[295]"
11888,LXXVII.,(The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
11889,LXXVII.,Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)--[fg]
11890,LXXVII.,
11891,LXXVIII.,LXXVIII.
11892,LXXVIII.,
11893,LXXVIII.,"Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to"
11894,LXXVIII.,"His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:"
11895,LXXVIII.,And yet at last he managed to get through
11896,LXXVIII.,"His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:"
11897,LXXVIII.,"The negro Baba helped a little too,"
11898,LXXVIII.,When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
11899,LXXVIII.,"And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,"
11900,LXXVIII.,"He paused, and took a survey up and down."
11901,LXXVIII.,
11902,LXXIX.,LXXIX.
11903,LXXIX.,
11904,LXXIX.,One difficulty still remained--his hair
11905,LXXIX.,Was hardly long enough; but Baba found
11906,LXXIX.,"So many false long tresses all to spare,"
11907,LXXIX.,"That soon his head was most completely crowned,"
11908,LXXIX.,After the manner then in fashion there;
11909,LXXIX.,And this addition with such gems was bound
11910,LXXIX.,"As suited the _ensemble_ of his toilet,"
11911,LXXIX.,While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.
11912,LXXIX.,
11913,LXXX.,LXXX.
11914,LXXX.,
11915,LXXX.,"And now being femininely all arrayed,"
11916,LXXX.,"With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,"
11917,LXXX.,"He looked in almost all respects a maid,[fh]"
11918,LXXX.,"And Baba smilingly exclaimed, ""You see, sirs,"
11919,LXXX.,A perfect transformation here displayed;
11920,LXXX.,"And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,"
11921,LXXX.,"That is--the Lady:"" clapping his hands twice,"
11922,LXXX.,Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.
11923,LXXX.,
11924,LXXXI.,LXXXI.
11925,LXXXI.,
11926,LXXXI.,"""You, sir,"" said Baba, nodding to the one,"
11927,LXXXI.,"""Will please to accompany those gentlemen"
11928,LXXXI.,"To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,"
11929,LXXXI.,"Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when"
11930,LXXXI.,"I say a thing, it must at once be done."
11931,LXXXI.,What fear you? think you this a lion's den?
11932,LXXXI.,"Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise"
11933,LXXXI.,Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.
11934,LXXXI.,
11935,LXXXII.,LXXXII.
11936,LXXXII.,
11937,LXXXII.,"""You fool! I tell you no one means you harm."""
11938,LXXXII.,"""So much the better,"" Juan said, ""for them;"
11939,LXXXII.,"Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,"
11940,LXXXII.,Which is not quite so light as you may deem.
11941,LXXXII.,"I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm,"
11942,LXXXII.,If any take me for that which I seem:
11943,LXXXII.,"So that I trust for every body's sake,"
11944,LXXXII.,"That this disguise may lead to no mistake."""
11945,LXXXII.,
11946,LXXXIII.,LXXXIII.
11947,LXXXIII.,
11948,LXXXIII.,"""Blockhead! come on, and see,"" quoth Baba; while"
11949,LXXXIII.,"Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who"
11950,LXXXIII.,"Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile"
11951,LXXXIII.,"Upon the metamorphosis in view,--"
11952,LXXXIII.,"""Farewell!"" they mutually exclaimed: ""this soil"
11953,LXXXIII.,Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;
11954,LXXXIII.,"One's turned half Mussulman, and one a maid,"
11955,LXXXIII.,"By this old black enchanter's unsought aid."""
11956,LXXXIII.,
11957,LXXXIV.,LXXXIV.
11958,LXXXIV.,
11959,LXXXIV.,"""Farewell!"" said Juan: ""should we meet no more,"
11960,LXXXIV.,"I wish you a good appetite.""--""Farewell!"""
11961,LXXXIV.,"Replied the other; ""though it grieves me sore:"
11962,LXXXIV.,"When we next meet, we'll have a tale to tell:"
11963,LXXXIV.,We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.
11964,LXXXIV.,"Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell."""
11965,LXXXIV.,"""Nay,"" quoth the maid, ""the Sultan's self shan't carry me,"
11966,LXXXIV.,"Unless his Highness promises to marry me."""
11967,LXXXIV.,
11968,LXXXV.,LXXXV.
11969,LXXXV.,
11970,LXXXV.,"And thus they parted, each by separate doors;"
11971,LXXXV.,"Baba led Juan onward, room by room,"
11972,LXXXV.,"Through glittering galleries, and o'er marble floors,"
11973,LXXXV.,"Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,"
11974,LXXXV.,"Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;"
11975,LXXXV.,And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
11976,LXXXV.,"It seemed as though they came upon a shrine,"
11977,LXXXV.,"For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine."
11978,LXXXV.,
11979,LXXXVI.,LXXXVI.
11980,LXXXVI.,
11981,LXXXVI.,"The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,"
11982,LXXXVI.,"Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;"
11983,LXXXVI.,Warriors thereon were battling furiously;
11984,LXXXVI.,"Here stalks the victor, there the vanquished lies;"
11985,LXXXVI.,"There captives led in triumph droop the eye,"
11986,LXXXVI.,And in perspective many a squadron flies:
11987,LXXXVI.,It seems the work of times before the line
11988,LXXXVI.,Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.
11989,LXXXVI.,
11990,LXXXVII.,LXXXVII.
11991,LXXXVII.,
11992,LXXXVII.,This massy portal stood at the wide close
11993,LXXXVII.,"Of a huge hall, and on its either side"
11994,LXXXVII.,"Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,"
11995,LXXXVII.,"Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied"
11996,LXXXVII.,In mockery to the enormous gate which rose
11997,LXXXVII.,O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:
11998,LXXXVII.,"The gate so splendid was in all its _features_,[296]"
11999,LXXXVII.,"You never thought about those little creatures,"
12000,LXXXVII.,
12001,LXXXVIII.,LXXXVIII.
12002,LXXXVIII.,
12003,LXXXVIII.,"Until you nearly trod on them, and then"
12004,LXXXVIII.,You started back in horror to survey
12005,LXXXVIII.,"The wondrous hideousness of those small men,"
12006,LXXXVIII.,"Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,"
12007,LXXXVIII.,"But an extraneous mixture, which no pen"
12008,LXXXVIII.,"Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;"
12009,LXXXVIII.,"They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb--"
12010,LXXXVIII.,"Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum."
12011,LXXXVIII.,
12012,LXXXIX.,LXXXIX.
12013,LXXXIX.,
12014,LXXXIX.,"Their duty was--for they were strong, and though"
12015,LXXXIX.,"They looked so little, did strong things at times--"
12016,LXXXIX.,"To ope this door, which they could really do,"
12017,LXXXIX.,The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;
12018,LXXXIX.,"And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,"
12019,LXXXIX.,"As is the custom of those Eastern climes,"
12020,LXXXIX.,To give some rebel Pacha a cravat--
12021,LXXXIX.,For mutes are generally used for that.
12022,LXXXIX.,
12023,XC.,XC.
12024,XC.,
12025,XC.,"They spoke by signs--that is, not spoke at all;"
12026,XC.,"And looking like two Incubi, they glared"
12027,XC.,As Baba with his fingers made them fall
12028,XC.,To heaving back the portal folds: it scared
12029,XC.,"Juan a moment, as this pair so small,"
12030,XC.,With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;[297]
12031,XC.,It was as if their little looks could poison
12032,XC.,Or fascinate whome'er they fixed their eyes on.
12033,XC.,
12034,XCI.,XCI.
12035,XCI.,
12036,XCI.,"Before they entered, Baba paused to hint"
12037,XCI.,To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:
12038,XCI.,"""If you could just contrive,"" he said, ""to stint"
12039,XCI.,"That somewhat manly majesty of stride,"
12040,XCI.,"'T would be as well, and--(though there's not much in 't)"
12041,XCI.,"To swing a little less from side to side,"
12042,XCI.,Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;--
12043,XCI.,"And also could you look a little modest,"
12044,XCI.,
12045,XCII.,XCII.
12046,XCII.,
12047,XCII.,"""'T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes"
12048,XCII.,"Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;"
12049,XCII.,"And if they should discover your disguise,"
12050,XCII.,You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;
12051,XCII.,"And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,"
12052,XCII.,"To find our way to Marmora without boats,"
12053,XCII.,Stitched up in sacks--a mode of navigation
12054,XCII.,"A good deal practised here upon occasion.""[298]"
12055,XCII.,
12056,XCIII.,XCIII.
12057,XCIII.,
12058,XCIII.,With this encouragement he led the way
12059,XCIII.,Into a room still nobler than the last;
12060,XCIII.,A rich confusion formed a disarray
12061,XCIII.,"In such sort, that the eye along it cast"
12062,XCIII.,"Could hardly carry anything away,"
12063,XCIII.,Object on object flashed so bright and fast;
12064,XCIII.,"A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,"
12065,XCIII.,Magnificently mingled in a litter.
12066,XCIII.,
12067,XCIV.,XCIV.
12068,XCIV.,
12069,XCIV.,Wealth had done wonders--taste not much; such things
12070,XCIV.,"Occur in Orient palaces, and even"
12071,XCIV.,In the more chastened domes of Western kings
12072,XCIV.,"(Of which I have also seen some six or seven),"
12073,XCIV.,Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings
12074,XCIV.,"Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;"
12075,XCIV.,"Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,"
12076,XCIV.,On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.

12080,XCV.,"In this imperial hall, at distance lay"
12081,XCV.,"Under a canopy, and there reclined"

12083,XCV.,"A lady; Baba stopped, and kneeling signed"
12084,XCV.,"To Juan, who though not much used to pray,"
12085,XCV.,"Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind"
12086,XCV.,What all this meant: while Baba bowed and bended

12089,XCVI.,XCVI.
12090,XCVI.,
12091,XCVI.,The lady rising up with such an air
12092,XCVI.,"As Venus rose with from the wave, on them"
12093,XCVI.,Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair[fi]
12094,XCVI.,"Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;"
12095,XCVI.,"And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,"
12096,XCVI.,"She signed to Baba, who first kissed the hem"
12097,XCVI.,"Of her deep purple robe, and, speaking low,"
12098,XCVI.,Pointed to Juan who remained below.
12099,XCVI.,
12100,XCVII.,XCVII.
12101,XCVII.,
12102,XCVII.,Her presence was as lofty as her state;
12103,XCVII.,"Her beauty of that overpowering kind,"
12104,XCVII.,Whose force Description only would abate:
12105,XCVII.,"I'd rather leave it much to your own mind,"
12106,XCVII.,Than lessen it by what I could relate
12107,XCVII.,Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
12108,XCVII.,Could I do justice to the full detail;
12109,XCVII.,"So, luckily for both, my phrases fail."

12113,XCVIII.,"Thus much however I may add,--her years"

12115,XCVIII.,"But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,"
12116,XCVIII.,And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things:[fj]
12117,XCVIII.,"Such as was Mary's, Queen of Scots; true--tears"
12118,XCVIII.,And Love destroy; and sapping Sorrow wrings
12119,XCVIII.,"Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow"

13974,XLV.,"Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;"
13975,XLV.,"And, looking at her steadfastly, she sighed,"
13976,XLV.,"As if she pitied her for being there,"
13977,XLV.,"A pretty stranger without friend or guide,"
13978,XLV.,"And all abashed, too, at the general stare"
13979,XLV.,"Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,"
13980,XLV.,With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.
13981,XLV.,
13982,XLVI.,XLVI.
13983,XLVI.,
13984,XLVI.,"But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,"
13985,XLVI.,"With ""Ladies, it is time to go to rest."
13986,XLVI.,"I'm puzzled what to do with _you_, my dear!"""
13987,XLVI.,"She added to Juanna, their new guest:"
13988,XLVI.,"""Your coming has been unexpected here,"
13989,XLVI.,And every couch is occupied; you had best
13990,XLVI.,Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early
13991,XLVI.,"We will have all things settled for you fairly."""
13992,XLVI.,
13993,XLVII.,XLVII.
13994,XLVII.,
13995,XLVII.,"Here Lolah interposed--""Mamma, you know"
13996,XLVII.,"You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear"
13997,XLVII.,That anybody should disturb you so;
13998,XLVII.,I'll take Juanna; we're a slenderer pair
13999,XLVII.,Than you would make the half of;--don't say no;
14000,XLVII.,"And I of your young charge will take due care."""
14001,XLVII.,"But here Katinka interfered, and said,"
14002,XLVII.,"""She also had compassion and a bed."""
14003,XLVII.,
14004,XLVIII.,XLVIII.
14005,XLVIII.,
14006,XLVIII.,"""Besides, I hate to sleep alone,"" quoth she."
14007,XLVIII.,"The matron frowned: ""Why so?""--""For fear of ghosts,"""
14008,XLVIII.,"Replied Katinka; ""I am sure I see"
14009,XLVIII.,A phantom upon each of the four posts;
14010,XLVIII.,"And then I have the worst dreams that can be,"
14011,XLVIII.,"Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts."""
14012,XLVIII.,"The dame replied, ""Between your dreams and you,"
14013,XLVIII.,I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.
14014,XLVIII.,
14015,XLIX.,XLIX.
14016,XLIX.,
14017,XLIX.,"""You, Lolah, must continue still to lie"
14018,XLIX.,"Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you"
14019,XLIX.,"The same, Katinka, until by and by:"
14020,XLIX.,"And I shall place Juanna with Dudù,"
14021,XLIX.,"Who's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,"
14022,XLIX.,And will not toss and chatter the night through.
14023,XLIX.,"What say you, child?""--Dudù said nothing, as"
14024,XLIX.,Her talents were of the more silent class;
14025,XLIX.,
14026,L.,L.
14027,L.,
14028,L.,"But she rose up, and kissed the matron's brow"
14029,L.,"Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,"
14030,L.,Katinka too; and with a gentle bow
14031,L.,(Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)
14032,L.,She took Juanna by the hand to show
14033,L.,"Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,"
14034,L.,The others pouting at the matron's preference
14035,L.,"Of Dudù, though they held their tongues from deference."
14036,L.,
14037,LI.,LI.
14038,LI.,
14039,LI.,It was a spacious chamber (Oda is
14040,LI.,"The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall"
14041,LI.,"Were couches, toilets--and much more than this"
14042,LI.,"I might describe, as I have seen it all,"
14043,LI.,But it suffices--little was amiss;
14044,LI.,"'T was on the whole a nobly furnished hall,"
14045,LI.,"With all things ladies want, save one or two,"
14046,LI.,And even those were nearer than they knew.
14047,LI.,
14048,LII.,LII.
14049,LII.,
14050,LII.,"Dudù, as has been said, was a sweet creature,"
14051,LII.,"Not very dashing, but extremely winning,"
14052,LII.,"With the most regulated charms of feature,"
14053,LII.,Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning
14054,LII.,Against proportion--the wild strokes of nature
14055,LII.,"Which they hit off at once in the beginning,"
14056,LII.,"Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,"
14057,LII.,"And pleasing, or unpleasing, still are like."
14058,LII.,
14059,LIII.,LIII.
14060,LIII.,
14061,LIII.,"But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,"
14062,LIII.,"Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,"
14063,LIII.,"Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,"
14064,LIII.,"Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it"
14065,LIII.,"Than are your mighty passions and so forth,"
14066,LIII.,"Which, some call ""the Sublime:"" I wish they'd try it:"
14067,LIII.,"I've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,"
14068,LIII.,And pity lovers rather more than seamen.
14069,LIII.,
14070,LIV.,LIV.
14071,LIV.,
14072,LIV.,"But she was pensive more than melancholy,"
14073,LIV.,"And serious more than pensive, and serene,"
14074,LIV.,"It may be, more than either--not unholy"
14075,LIV.,"Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been."
14076,LIV.,"The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly"
14077,LIV.,"Unconscious, albeit turned of quick seventeen,"
14078,LIV.,"That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;"
14079,LIV.,She never thought about herself at all.
14080,LIV.,
14081,LV.,LV.
14082,LV.,
14083,LV.,And therefore was she kind and gentle as
14084,LV.,"The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,"
14085,LV.,By which its nomenclature came to pass;[gv]
14086,LV.,Thus most appropriately has been shown
14087,LV.,"""Lucus à _non_ lucendo,"" _not_ what _was_,"
14088,LV.,But what _was not_; a sort of style that's grown
14089,LV.,"Extremely common in this age, whose metal"
14090,LV.,"The Devil may decompose, but never settle:[gw]"
14091,LV.,
14092,LVI.,LVI.
14093,LVI.,
14094,LVI.,"I think it may be of ""Corinthian Brass,""[351]"
14095,LVI.,"Which was a mixture of all metals, but"
14096,LVI.,The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass
14097,LVI.,This long parenthesis: I could not shut
14098,LVI.,"It sooner for the soul of me, and class"
14099,LVI.,"My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put"
14100,LVI.,A kind construction upon them and me:
14101,LVI.,But _that_ you won't--then don't--I am not less free.
14102,LVI.,
14103,LVII.,LVII.
14104,LVII.,
14105,LVII.,"'T is time we should return to plain narration,"
14106,LVII.,"And thus my narrative proceeds:--Dudù,"
14107,LVII.,"With every kindness short of ostentation,"
14108,LVII.,"Showed Juan, or Juanna, through and through"
14109,LVII.,"This labyrinth of females, and each station"
14110,LVII.,Described--what's strange--in words extremely few:
14111,LVII.,"I have but one simile, and that's a blunder,"
14112,LVII.,"For wordless woman, which is _silent_ thunder.[gx]"
14113,LVII.,
14114,LVIII.,LVIII.
14115,LVIII.,
14116,LVIII.,"And next she gave her (I say _her_, because"
14117,LVIII.,"The gender still was epicene, at least"
14118,LVIII.,"In outward show, which is a saving clause)"
14119,LVIII.,"An outline of the customs of the East,"
14120,LVIII.,"With all their chaste integrity of laws,"
14121,LVIII.,"By which the more a Harem is increased,"
14122,LVIII.,The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
14123,LVIII.,Of any supernumerary beauties.
14124,LVIII.,
14125,LIX.,LIX.
14126,LIX.,
14127,LIX.,And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
14128,LIX.,Dudú was fond of kissing--which I'm sure
14129,LIX.,"That nobody can ever take amiss,"
14130,LIX.,"Because 't is pleasant, so that it be pure,"
14131,LIX.,And between females means no more than this--
14132,LIX.,"That they have nothing better near, or newer."
14133,LIX.,"""Kiss"" rhymes to ""bliss"" in fact as well as verse--"
14134,LIX.,I wish it never led to something worse.
14135,LIX.,
14136,LX.,LX.
14137,LX.,
14138,LX.,In perfect innocence she then unmade
14139,LX.,"Her toilet, which cost little, for she was"
14140,LX.,"A child of Nature, carelessly arrayed:"
14141,LX.,"If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,"
14142,LX.,"'T was like the fawn, which, in the lake displayed,"
14143,LX.,"Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,"
14144,LX.,"When first she starts, and then returns to peep,"
14145,LX.,Admiring this new native of the deep.
14146,LX.,
14147,LXI.,LXI.
14148,LXI.,
14149,LXI.,And one by one her articles of dress
14150,LXI.,Were laid aside; but not before she offered
14151,LXI.,"Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess"
14152,LXI.,Of modesty declined the assistance proffered:
14153,LXI.,Which passed well off--as she could do no less;
14154,LXI.,"Though by this _politesse_ she rather suffered,"
14155,LXI.,"Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,"
14156,LXI.,"Which surely were invented for our sins,--"
14157,LXI.,
14158,LXII.,LXII.
14159,LXII.,
14160,LXII.,"Making a woman like a porcupine,"
14161,LXII.,"Not to be rashly touched. But still more dread,"
14162,LXII.,"Oh ye! whose fate it is, as once 't was mine,"
14163,LXII.,"In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;--"
14164,LXII.,I did my very boyish best to shine
14165,LXII.,In tricking her out for a masquerade:
14166,LXII.,"The pins were placed sufficiently, but not"
14167,LXII.,Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.
14168,LXII.,
14169,LXIII.,LXIII.
14170,LXIII.,
14171,LXIII.,"But these are foolish things to all the wise,"
14172,LXIII.,And I love Wisdom more than she loves me;
14173,LXIII.,My tendency is to philosophise
14174,LXIII.,"On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;"
14175,LXIII.,But still the spouseless virgin _Knowledge_ flies.
14176,LXIII.,What are we? and whence came we? what shall be
14177,LXIII.,Our _ultimate_ existence? what's our present?
14178,LXIII.,"Are questions answerless, and yet incessant."
14179,LXIII.,
14180,LXIV.,LXIV.
14181,LXIV.,
14182,LXIV.,There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
14183,LXIV.,"And distant from each other burned the lights,"
14184,LXIV.,And slumber hovered o'er each lovely limb
14185,LXIV.,"Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,"
14186,LXIV.,"They should have walked there in their sprightliest trim,"
14187,LXIV.,"By way of change from their sepulchral sites,"
14188,LXIV.,And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
14189,LXIV.,Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.
14190,LXIV.,
14191,LXV.,LXV.
14192,LXV.,
14193,LXV.,"Many and beautiful lay those around,"
14194,LXV.,"Like flowers of different hue, and clime, and root,"
14195,LXV.,"In some exotic garden sometimes found,"
14196,LXV.,"With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot."
14197,LXV.,"One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,"
14198,LXV.,"And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit"
14199,LXV.,"Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,"
14200,LXV.,"And lips apart, which showed the pearls beneath."
14201,LXV.,
14202,LXVI.,LXVI.
14203,LXVI.,
14204,LXVI.,"One with her flushed cheek laid on her white arm,"
14205,LXVI.,And raven ringlets gathered in dark crowd
14206,LXVI.,"Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;"
14207,LXVI.,"And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud"
14208,LXVI.,"The moon breaks, half unveiled each further charm,"
14209,LXVI.,"As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,"
14210,LXVI.,Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
14211,LXVI.,All bashfully to struggle into light.
14212,LXVI.,
14213,LXVII.,LXVII.
14214,LXVII.,
14215,LXVII.,"This is no bull, although it sounds so; for"
14216,LXVII.,"'T was night, but there were lamps, as hath been said."
14217,LXVII.,A third's all pallid aspect offered more
14218,LXVII.,"The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betrayed"
14219,LXVII.,Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
14220,LXVII.,Belovéd and deplored; while slowly strayed
14221,LXVII.,"(As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges"
14222,LXVII.,The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.
14223,LXVII.,
14224,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
14225,LXVIII.,
14226,LXVIII.,"A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,"
14227,LXVIII.,"Lay in a breathless, hushed, and stony sleep;"
14228,LXVIII.,"White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,"
14229,LXVIII.,"Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,"
14230,LXVIII.,"Or Lot's wife done in salt,--or what you will;--"
14231,LXVIII.,"My similes are gathered in a heap,"
14232,LXVIII.,So pick and choose--perhaps you'll be content

14234,LXVIII.,
14235,LXIX.,LXIX.
14236,LXIX.,
14237,LXIX.,And lo! a fifth appears;--and what is she?
14238,LXIX.,"A lady of a ""certain age,""[352] which means"
14239,LXIX.,Certainly agéd--what her years might be
14240,LXIX.,"I know not, never counting past their teens;"
14241,LXIX.,"But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,"
14242,LXIX.,As ere that awful period intervenes
14243,LXIX.,"Which lays both men and women on the shelf,"
14244,LXIX.,To meditate upon their sins and self.
14245,LXIX.,
14246,LXX.,LXX.
14247,LXX.,
14248,LXX.,"But all this time how slept, or dreamed, Dudú?"
14249,LXX.,"With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,"
14250,LXX.,And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
14251,LXX.,"But ere the middle watch was hardly over,"
14252,LXX.,"Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,"
14253,LXX.,"And phantoms hovered, or might seem to hover,"
14254,LXX.,"To those who like their company, about"
14255,LXX.,"The apartment, on a sudden she screamed out:"
14256,LXX.,
14257,LXXI.,LXXI.
14258,LXXI.,
14259,LXXI.,"And that so loudly, that upstarted all"
14260,LXXI.,"The Oda, in a general commotion:"
14261,LXXI.,"Matron and maids, and those whom you may call"
14262,LXXI.,"Neither, came crowding like the waves of Ocean,"
14263,LXXI.,"One on the other, throughout the whole hall,"
14264,LXXI.,"All trembling, wondering, without the least notion"
14265,LXXI.,More than I have myself of what could make
14266,LXXI.,The calm Dudù so turbulently wake.
14267,LXXI.,
14268,LXXII.,LXXII.
14269,LXXII.,
14270,LXXII.,"But wide awake she was, and round her bed."
14271,LXXII.,"With floating draperies and with flying hair,"
14272,LXXII.,"With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,"
14273,LXXII.,"And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,"
14274,LXXII.,And bright as any meteor ever bred
14275,LXXII.,"By the North Pole,--they sought her cause of care,"
14276,LXXII.,"For she seemed agitated, flushed, and frightened,"
14277,LXXII.,"Her eye dilated, and her colour heightened."
14278,LXXII.,
14279,LXXIII.,LXXIII.
14280,LXXIII.,
14281,LXXIII.,But what is strange--and a strong proof how great
14282,LXXIII.,A blessing is sound sleep--Juanna lay
14283,LXXIII.,As fast as ever husband by his mate
14284,LXXIII.,In holy matrimony snores away.
14285,LXXIII.,Not all the clamour broke her happy state
14286,LXXIII.,"Of slumber, ere they shook her,--so they say"
14287,LXXIII.,"At least,--and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,"
14288,LXXIII.,And yawned a good deal with discreet surprise.[gy]
14289,LXXIII.,
14290,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
14291,LXXIV.,
14292,LXXIV.,"And now commenced a strict investigation,"
14293,LXXIV.,"Which, as all spoke at once, and more than once"
14294,LXXIV.,"Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,"
14295,LXXIV.,Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce
14296,LXXIV.,To answer in a very clear oration.
14297,LXXIV.,"Dudú had never passed for wanting sense,"
14298,LXXIV.,"But being ""no orator as Brutus is,""[353]"
14299,LXXIV.,Could not at first expound what was amiss.

14301,LXXV.,LXXV.
14302,LXXV.,
14303,LXXV.,"At length she said, that in a slumber sound"
14304,LXXV.,"She dreamed a dream, of walking in a wood--"
14305,LXXV.,"A ""wood obscure,"" like that where Dante found[354]"
14306,LXXV.,Himself in at the age when all grow good;[gz]
14307,LXXV.,"Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crowned"
14308,LXXV.,Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;
14309,LXXV.,"And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,"

14311,LXXV.,
14312,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
14313,LXXVI.,
14314,LXXVI.,"And in the midst a golden apple grew,--"
14315,LXXVI.,A most prodigious pippin--but it hung
14316,LXXVI.,Rather too high and distant; that she threw
14317,LXXVI.,"Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung"
14318,LXXVI.,"Stones and whatever she could pick up, to"
14319,LXXVI.,"Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung"
14320,LXXVI.,"To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,"
14321,LXXVI.,But always at a most provoking height;[ha]
14322,LXXVI.,
14323,LXXVII.,LXXVII.
14324,LXXVII.,
14325,LXXVII.,"That on a sudden, when she least had hope,"
14326,LXXVII.,It fell down of its own accord before
14327,LXXVII.,Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
14328,LXXVII.,"And pick it up, and bite it to the core;"
14329,LXXVII.,That just as her young lip began to ope[hb]
14330,LXXVII.,"Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,"
14331,LXXVII.,"A bee flew out, and stung her to the heart,"
14332,LXXVII.,And so--she woke with a great scream and start.
14333,LXXVII.,
14334,LXXVIII.,LXXVIII.
14335,LXXVIII.,
14336,LXXVIII.,All this she told with some confusion and

14351,LXXIX.,"The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm"

14380,LXXXII.,Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;
14381,LXXXII.,"But poor Dudù, with large drops in her own,"
14382,LXXXII.,"Resulting from the scolding or the vision,"
14383,LXXXII.,Implored that present pardon might be shown
14384,LXXXII.,"For this first fault, and that on no condition"
14385,LXXXII.,(She added in a soft and piteous tone)
14386,LXXXII.,"Juanna should be taken from her, and"
14387,LXXXII.,Her future dreams should be all kept in hand.
14388,LXXXII.,
14389,LXXXIII.,LXXXIII.
14390,LXXXIII.,
14391,LXXXIII.,"She promised never more to have a dream,"
14392,LXXXIII.,At least to dream so loudly as just now;
14393,LXXXIII.,She wondered at herself how she could scream--
14394,LXXXIII.,"'T was foolish, nervous, as she must allow,"
14395,LXXXIII.,"A fond hallucination, and a theme"
14396,LXXXIII.,"For laughter--but she felt her spirits low,"
14397,LXXXIII.,And begged they would excuse her; she'd get over
14398,LXXXIII.,"This weakness in a few hours, and recover."
14399,LXXXIII.,
14400,LXXXIV.,LXXXIV.
14401,LXXXIV.,
14402,LXXXIV.,"And here Juanna kindly interposed,"
14403,LXXXIV.,And said she felt herself extremely well
14404,LXXXIV.,"Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed,"
14405,LXXXIV.,When all around rang like a tocsin bell;
14406,LXXXIV.,She did not find herself the least disposed
14407,LXXXIV.,"To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell"
14408,LXXXIV.,"Apart from one who had no sin to show,"
14409,LXXXIV.,"Save that of dreaming once ""mal-à-propos."""

14413,LXXXV.,"As thus Juanna spoke, Dudù turned round"
14414,LXXXV.,And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
14415,LXXXV.,"Her neck alone was seen, but that was found"
14416,LXXXV.,The colour of a budding rose's crest.[hc]
14417,LXXXV.,"I can't tell why she blushed, nor can expound"
14418,LXXXV.,The mystery of this rupture of their test;
14419,LXXXV.,"All that I know is, that the facts I state"
14420,LXXXV.,"Are true as Truth has ever been of late,"
14421,LXXXV.,
14422,LXXXVI.,LXXXVI.
14423,LXXXVI.,
14424,LXXXVI.,"And so good night to them,--or, if you will,"
14425,LXXXVI.,"Good morrow--for the cock had crown, and light"
14426,LXXXVI.,"Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,"
14427,LXXXVI.,And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
14428,LXXXVI.,"Of the long caravan, which in the chill"
14429,LXXXVI.,Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height
14430,LXXXVI.,"That stretches to the stony belt, which girds"

14434,LXXXVII.,
14435,LXXXVII.,"With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,"
14436,LXXXVII.,Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale
14437,LXXXVII.,"As Passion rises, with its bosom worn,"
14438,LXXXVII.,"Arrayed herself with mantle, gem, and veil."
14439,LXXXVII.,"The Nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,"
14440,LXXXVII.,"Which fable places in her breast of wail,"
14441,LXXXVII.,Is lighter far of heart and voice than those

14444,LXXXVIII.,LXXXVIII.
14445,LXXXVIII.,
14446,LXXXVIII.,"And that's the moral of this composition,"
14447,LXXXVIII.,If people would but see its real drift;--
14448,LXXXVIII.,"But _that_ they will not do without suspicion,"
14449,LXXXVIII.,Because all gentle readers have the gift
14450,LXXXVIII.,Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision:
14451,LXXXVIII.,While gentle writers also love to lift
14452,LXXXVIII.,"Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,"
14453,LXXXVIII.,The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.

14461,LXXXIX.,"So beautiful that Art could little mend her,"
14462,LXXXIX.,Though pale with conflicts between Love and Pride;--
14463,LXXXIX.,"So agitated was she with her error,"

14472,XC.,A thing of much less import in that clime--
14473,XC.,At least to those of incomes which afford
14474,XC.,The filling up their whole connubial cargo--

14482,XCI.,"At hand, as one may like to have a fan,"
14483,XCI.,"And therefore of Circassians had good store,"
14484,XCI.,As an amusement after the Divan;
14485,XCI.,"Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,"
14486,XCI.,Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.
14487,XCI.,

14493,XCII.,"He drank six cups of coffee at the least,"
14494,XCII.,"And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,"
14495,XCII.,Whose victories had recently increased

14592,CI.,And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
14593,CI.,"In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;"
14594,CI.,"And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,"
14595,CI.,"Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,"

14603,CII.,He could not help the thing which he related:
14604,CII.,"Then out it came at length, that to Dudù"
14605,CII.,"Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;"
14606,CII.,"But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on"

14637,CV.,"Her cheek turned ashes, ears rung, brain whirled round,"
14638,CV.,"As if she had received a sudden blow,"

14649,CVI.,When things beyond the common have occurred;--

14657,CVII.,"Of inspiration gathered from distress,"
14658,CVII.,When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull
14659,CVII.,"The heart asunder;--then, as more or less"
14660,CVII.,"Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,"
14661,CVII.,"She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,"
14662,CVII.,And bowed her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.
14663,CVII.,
14664,CVIII.,CVIII.
14665,CVIII.,
14666,CVIII.,Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
14667,CVIII.,"Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,"
14668,CVIII.,"Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,"
14669,CVIII.,"Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,"
14670,CVIII.,"A low, soft ottoman), and black Despair"
14671,CVIII.,"Stirred up and down her bosom like a billow,"
14672,CVIII.,Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check
14673,CVIII.,"Its farther course, but must receive its wreck."

14675,CIX.,CIX.
14676,CIX.,
14677,CIX.,"Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping"

14679,CIX.,"And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,"
14680,CIX.,"White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:"
14681,CIX.,Would that I were a painter! to be grouping
14682,CIX.,All that a poet drags into detail!

14692,CX.,"At length she rose up, and began to walk"

14703,CXI.,"A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed"

16663,XIV.,"A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,"

17388,LXXX.,"A word which little suits with Seraskiers,"
17389,LXXX.,Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.
17390,LXXX.,"He died, deserving well his country's tears,"
17391,LXXX.,A savage sort of military martyr:
17392,LXXX.,"An English naval officer, who wished"
17393,LXXX.,"To make him prisoner, was also dished:"

17395,LXXXI.,LXXXI.
17396,LXXXI.,
17397,LXXXI.,For all the answer to his proposition
17398,LXXXI.,Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;[458]
17399,LXXXI.,"On which the rest, without more intermission,"
17400,LXXXI.,Began to lay about with steel and lead--
17401,LXXXI.,The pious metals most in requisition
17402,LXXXI.,On such occasions: not a single head
17403,LXXXI.,"Was spared;--three thousand Moslems perished here,"

17410,LXXXII.,Where fights not to the last some desperate heart
17411,LXXXII.,For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.[460]
17412,LXXXII.,Here War forgot his own destructive art
17413,LXXXII.,In more destroying Nature; and the heat

17423,LXXXIII.,"In vain he kicked, and swore, and writhed, and bled,"
17424,LXXXIII.,And howled for help as wolves do for a meal--

17441,LXXXV.,"However this may be, 't is pretty sure"
17442,LXXXV.,"The Russian officer for life was lamed,"
17443,LXXXV.,"For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,"
17444,LXXXV.,And left him 'midst the invalid and maimed:
17445,LXXXV.,The regimental surgeon could not cure
17446,LXXXV.,"His patient, and, perhaps, was to be blamed"
17447,LXXXV.,"More than the head of the inveterate foe,"

17455,LXXXVI.,in leaving verse more free from the restriction
17456,LXXXVI.,"Of Truth than prose, unless to suit the mart"

17466,LXXXVII.,Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word
17467,LXXXVII.,Acknowledge aught of dread of Death or foe:
17468,LXXXVII.,In vain the yell of victory is roared
17469,LXXXVII.,By the advancing Muscovite--the groan
17470,LXXXVII.,Of the last foe is echoed by his own.

17534,XCIII.,"Because it might not solace ""ears polite;""[463]"

17629,CII.,"Johnson, who really loved him in his way,"
17630,CII.,Picked out amongst his followers with some skill

17637,CIII.,CIII.
17638,CIII.,
17639,CIII.,And all allowances besides of plunder

17641,CIII.,"Juan consented to march on through thunder,"
17642,CIII.,Which thinned at every step their ranks of men:
17643,CIII.,"And yet the rest rushed eagerly--no wonder,"
17644,CIII.,"For they were heated by the hope of gain,"

20329,XXXII.,"_Outward_ dislike, which don't look well abroad;"

20383,XXXVII.,Save such as Southey can afford to give.
20384,XXXVII.,Perhaps he longed in bitter frosts for climes
20385,XXXVII.,In which the Neva's ice would cease to live
20386,XXXVII.,"Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,"

20435,XLII.,"This is the way physicians mend or end us,"
20436,XLII.,_Secundum artem_: but although we sneer

20443,XLII.,
20444,XLIII.,XLIII.
20445,XLIII.,
20446,XLIII.,Juan demurred at this first notice to
20447,XLIII.,"Quit; and though Death had threatened an ejection,"
20448,XLIII.,"His youth and constitution bore him through,"
20449,XLIII.,And sent the doctors in a new direction.
20450,XLIII.,But still his state was delicate: the hue
20451,XLIII.,Of health but flickered with a faint reflection
20452,XLIII.,"Along his wasted cheek, and seemed to gravel"
20453,XLIII.,The faculty--who said that he must travel.
20454,XLIII.,
20455,XLIV.,XLIV.
20456,XLIV.,
20457,XLIV.,"The climate was too cold, they said, for him,"

20460,XLIV.,Who did not like at first to lose her minion:
20461,XLIV.,"But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,"
20462,XLIV.,"And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,"
20463,XLIV.,"She then resolved to send him on a mission,"
20464,XLIV.,But in a style becoming his condition.
20465,XLIV.,
20466,XLV.,XLV.
20467,XLV.,
20468,XLV.,"There was just then a kind of a discussion,"

20470,XLV.,"Between the British cabinet and Russian,"
20471,XLV.,Maintained with all the due prevarication
20472,XLV.,With which great states such things are apt to push on;
20473,XLV.,"Something about the Baltic's navigation,"
20474,XLV.,"Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,"
20475,XLV.,Which Britons deem their _uti possidetis_.
20476,XLV.,
20477,XLVI.,XLVI.
20478,XLVI.,
20479,XLVI.,"So Catherine, who had a handsome way"
20480,XLVI.,"Of fitting out her favourites, conferred"
20481,XLVI.,"This secret charge on Juan, to display"
20482,XLVI.,"At once her royal splendour, and reward"
20483,XLVI.,"His services. He kissed hands the next day,"
20484,XLVI.,"Received instructions how to play his card,"
20485,XLVI.,"Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,"
20486,XLVI.,Which showed what great discernment was the donor's.
20487,XLVI.,
20488,XLVII.,XLVII.
20489,XLVII.,
20490,XLVII.,"But she was lucky, and luck's all. Your Queens"
20491,XLVII.,Are generally prosperous in reigning--
20492,XLVII.,Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means:--
20493,XLVII.,"But to continue--though her years were waning,"
20494,XLVII.,Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
20495,XLVII.,"And though her dignity brooked no complaining,"
20496,XLVII.,"So much did Juan's setting off distress her,"
20497,XLVII.,She could not find at first a fit successor.

20500,XLVIII.,
20501,XLVIII.,"But Time, the comforter, will come at last;"

20503,XLVIII.,"Of candidates requesting to be placed,"
20504,XLVIII.,Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:--
20505,XLVIII.,"Not that she meant to fix again in haste,"
20506,XLVIII.,"Nor did she find the quantity encumber,"
20507,XLVIII.,"But always choosing with deliberation,"
20508,XLVIII.,Kept the place open for their emulation.

20512,XLIX.,"While this high post of honour's in abeyance,"
20513,XLIX.,"For one or two days, reader, we request"

20549,LII.,Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle
20550,LII.,"With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:"
20551,LII.,"But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore"

20553,LII.,
20554,LIII.,LIII.
20555,LIII.,
20556,LIII.,"Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as"
20557,LIII.,"Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.--I"
20558,LIII.,cannot tell exactly what it was;
20559,LIII.,He was not yet quite old enough to prove
20560,LIII.,"Parental feelings, and the other class,"
20561,LIII.,"Called brotherly affection, could not move"
20562,LIII.,"His bosom,--for he never had a sister:"

20564,LIII.,
20565,LIV.,LIV.

20576,LV.,LV.
20577,LV.,
20578,LV.,Just now there was no peril of temptation;

20580,LV.,As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;
20581,LV.,"His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved"

20587,LVI.,LVI.
20588,LVI.,
20589,LVI.,'T was strange enough she should retain the impression
20590,LVI.,"Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;"
20591,LVI.,"But though three Bishops told her the transgression,"
20592,LVI.,She showed a great dislike to holy water;
20593,LVI.,She also had no passion for confession;
20594,LVI.,"Perhaps she had nothing to confess:--no matter,"
20595,LVI.,"Whate'er the cause, the Church made little of it--"

20599,LVII.,
20600,LVII.,"In fact, the only Christian she could bear"

20602,LVII.,In place of what her home and friends once _were_.
20603,LVII.,_He_ naturally loved what he protected:
20604,LVII.,"And thus they formed a rather curious pair,"
20605,LVII.,"A guardian green in years, a ward connected"
20606,LVII.,"In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;"

20670,LXIII.,Senates and sages have condemned its use--

23261,LII.,According as their minds or backs are bent.
23262,LII.,Some waltz--some draw--some fathom the abyss

24212,XXIV.,"For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,"
24213,XXIV.,As in freemasonry a higher brother.
24214,XXIV.,Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;

24232,XXVI.,Also there bin[662] another pious reason

24234,XXVI.,"Which is, that there is scarce a single season"
24235,XXVI.,Which doth not shake some very splendid house
24236,XXVI.,With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason--
24237,XXVI.,A topic Scandal doth delight to rouse:

24247,XXVII.,"Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I"

24295,XXXI.,
24296,XXXII.,XXXII.
24297,XXXII.,
24298,XXXII.,To all she was polite without parade;

24300,XXXII.,"Which flatters, but is flattery conveyed"
24301,XXXII.,In such a sort as cannot leave behind
24302,XXXII.,A trace unworthy either wife or maid;--
24303,XXXII.,"A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,[lz]"
24304,XXXII.,"To those who were, or passed for meritorious,"
24305,XXXII.,Just to console sad Glory for being glorious;

24307,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
24308,XXXIII.,
24309,XXXIII.,"Which is in all respects, save now and then,"
24310,XXXIII.,A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze
24311,XXXIII.,Upon the shades of those distinguished men
24312,XXXIII.,"Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,"
24313,XXXIII.,The praise of persecution. Gaze again
24314,XXXIII.,On the most favoured; and amidst the blaze

24317,XXXIII.,
24318,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
24319,XXXIV.,
24320,XXXIV.,There also was of course in Adeline
24321,XXXIV.,"That calm patrician polish in the address,"
24322,XXXIV.,Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line
24323,XXXIV.,Of anything which Nature would express;
24324,XXXIV.,"Just as a Mandarin finds nothing fine,--"
24325,XXXIV.,"At least his manner suffers not to guess,"
24326,XXXIV.,That anything he views can greatly please:
24327,XXXIV.,Perhaps we have borrowed this from the Chinese--[ma]
24328,XXXIV.,
24329,XXXV.,XXXV.
24330,XXXV.,
24331,XXXV.,"Perhaps from Horace: his _""Nil admirari""_"
24332,XXXV.,"Was what he called the ""Art of Happiness""--"
24333,XXXV.,"An art on which the artists greatly vary,"
24334,XXXV.,And have not yet attained to much success.
24335,XXXV.,"However, 't is expedient to be wary:"
24336,XXXV.,"Indifference, certes, don't produce distress;"
24337,XXXV.,And rash Enthusiasm in good society

24339,XXXV.,
24340,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
24341,XXXVI.,
24342,XXXVI.,But Adeline was not indifferent: for
24343,XXXVI.,"(_Now_ for a common-place!) beneath the snow,"
24344,XXXVI.,As a Volcano holds the lava more
24345,XXXVI.,Within--_et cætera_. Shall I go on?--No!
24346,XXXVI.,"I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,"
24347,XXXVI.,So let the often-used Volcano go.
24348,XXXVI.,"Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,"

24350,XXXVI.,
24351,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
24352,XXXVII.,
24353,XXXVII.,I'll have another figure in a trice:--
24354,XXXVII.,What say you to a bottle of champagne?
24355,XXXVII.,"Frozen into a very vinous ice,"
24356,XXXVII.,"Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,"
24357,XXXVII.,"Yet in the very centre, past all price,"
24358,XXXVII.,About a liquid glassful will remain;
24359,XXXVII.,And this is stronger than the strongest grape
24360,XXXVII.,Could e'er express in its expanded shape:
24361,XXXVII.,
24362,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
24363,XXXVIII.,

24366,XXXVIII.,A hidden nectar under a cold presence.[mb]
24367,XXXVIII.,And such are many--though I only meant her

27182,XVII.,"'T is thus the Good will amiably err,"
27183,XVII.,"And eke the Wise, as has been often shown."
27184,XVII.,"Experience is the chief philosopher,"
27185,XVII.,But saddest when his science is well known:

27187,XVII.,Their folly in forgetting there are fools.

27191,XVIII.,"Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?"

27205,XIX.,But speculating as I cast mine eye
27206,XIX.,"On what may suit or may not suit my story,"
27207,XIX.,"And never straining hard to versify,"

27212,XX.,
27213,XX.,I don't know that there may be much ability

27226,XXI.,The first is rather more than mortal can do;
27227,XXI.,The second may be sadly done or gaily;
27228,XXI.,The third is still more difficult to stand to;
27229,XXI.,"The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily:"

27272,XXV.,The difficulty lies in colouring
27273,XXV.,(Keeping the due proportions still in sight)

27292,XXVII.,"And when you may not be sublime, be arch,"
27293,XXVII.,"Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter."
27294,XXVII.,We surely may find something worth research:
27295,XXVII.,"Columbus found a new world in a cutter,"

27318,XXIX.,"For Morals--Marriage; and, this question carried,"

27323,XXX.,"Juan replied, with all becoming deference,"

27337,XXXI.,There's nothing women love to dabble in
27338,XXXI.,More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)

27342,XXXI.,
27343,XXXII.,XXXII.

27346,XXXII.,"Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,"

27348,XXXII.,Was there chaste dame who had not in her head
27349,XXXII.,"Some drama of the marriage Unities,"
27350,XXXII.,"Observed as strictly both at board and bed,"
27351,XXXII.,"As those of Aristotle, though sometimes"

27359,XXXIII.,"Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end"
27360,XXXIII.,"A line, and leave Posterity undone,"
27361,XXXIII.,Unless a marriage was applied to mend
27362,XXXIII.,"The prospect and their morals: and besides,"

27367,XXXIV.,"From these they will be careful to select,"

27375,XXXIV.,
27376,XXXV.,XXXV.
27377,XXXV.,
27378,XXXV.,When Rapp the Harmonist embargoed Marriage[747]
27379,XXXV.,In his harmonious settlement--(which flourishes
27380,XXXV.,"Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,"
27381,XXXV.,"Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,"
27382,XXXV.,Without those sad expenses which disparage
27383,XXXV.,What Nature naturally most encourages)--
27384,XXXV.,"Why called he ""Harmony"" a state sans wedlock?"
27385,XXXV.,Now here I've got the preacher at a dead lock.
27386,XXXV.,
27387,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
27388,XXXVI.,
27389,XXXVI.,Because he either meant to sneer at Harmony
27390,XXXVI.,"Or Marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly."
27391,XXXVI.,But whether reverend Rapp learned this in Germany
27392,XXXVI.,"Or no, 't is said his sect is rich and godly,"
27393,XXXVI.,"Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any"
27394,XXXVI.,"Of ours, although they propagate more broadly."
27395,XXXVI.,"My objection's to his title, not his ritual."

27397,XXXVI.,
27398,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
27399,XXXVII.,
27400,XXXVII.,"But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,"

27402,XXXVII.,"Professors of that genial art, and patrons"
27403,XXXVII.,Of all the modest part of Propagation;
27404,XXXVII.,"Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,"
27405,XXXVII.,"That half its produce tends to Emigration,"
27406,XXXVII.,That sad result of passions and potatoes--

27408,XXXVII.,
27409,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
27410,XXXVIII.,
27411,XXXVIII.,Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
27412,XXXVIII.,"I wish she had: his book's the eleventh commandment,"
27413,XXXVIII.,"Which says, ""Thou shall not marry,"" unless _well_:"
27414,XXXVIII.,This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
27415,XXXVIII.,"'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell,"
27416,XXXVIII.,"Nor canvass what ""so eminent a hand"" meant;[748]"
27417,XXXVIII.,"But, certes, it conducts to lives ascetic,"
27418,XXXVIII.,Or turning Marriage into Arithmetic.
27419,XXXVIII.,
27420,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
27421,XXXIX.,
27422,XXXIX.,"But Adeline, who probably presumed"
27423,XXXIX.,"That Juan had enough of maintenance,"
27424,XXXIX.,"Or _separate_ maintenance, in case 't was doomed--"
27425,XXXIX.,As on the whole it is an even chance
27426,XXXIX.,"That bridegrooms, after they are fairly _groomed_,"
27427,XXXIX.,May retrograde a little in the Dance
27428,XXXIX.,"Of Marriage--(which might form a painter's fame,"

27430,XXXIX.,
27431,XL.,XL.
27432,XL.,
27433,XL.,But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
27434,XL.,"In her own mind, and that's enough for Woman:"
27435,XL.,"But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,"
27436,XL.,"Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman,[nu]"
27437,XL.,And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.
27438,XL.,She deemed his merits something more than common:
27439,XL.,"All these were unobjectionable matches,"
27440,XL.,"And might go on, if well wound up, like watches."
27441,XL.,
27442,XLI.,XLI.

27447,XLI.,"Till skimmed--and then there was some milk and water,"
27448,XLI.,"With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,"
27449,XLI.,Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?
27450,XLI.,"Love's riotous, but Marriage should have quiet,"
27451,XLI.,"And being consumptive, live on a milk diet."
27452,XLI.,
27453,XLII.,XLII.
27454,XLII.,
27455,XLII.,"And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,"
27456,XLII.,"A dashing _demoiselle_ of good estate,"
27457,XLII.,Whose heart was fixed upon a star or blue string;
27458,XLII.,"But whether English Dukes grew rare of late,"
27459,XLII.,"Or that she had not harped upon the true string,"
27460,XLII.,"By which such Sirens can attract our great,"
27461,XLII.,"She took up with some foreign younger brother,"
27462,XLII.,A Russ or Turk--the one's as good as t' other.
27463,XLII.,
27464,XLIII.,XLIII.
27465,XLIII.,
27466,XLIII.,"And then there was--but why should I go on,"
27467,XLIII.,Unless the ladies should go off?--there was
27468,XLIII.,"Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,"
27469,XLIII.,"Of the best class, and better than her class,--"
27470,XLIII.,"Aurora Raby, a young star who shone"
27471,XLIII.,"O'er Life, too sweet an image for such glass,"
27472,XLIII.,"A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded,"
27473,XLIII.,A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;

27475,XLIV.,XLIV.
27476,XLIV.,
27477,XLIV.,"Rich, noble, but an orphan--left an only"
27478,XLIV.,Child to the care of guardians good and kind--
27479,XLIV.,But still her aspect had an air so lonely;
27480,XLIV.,Blood is not water; and where shall we find
27481,XLIV.,Feelings of Youth like those which overthrown lie
27482,XLIV.,"By Death, when we are left, alas! behind,"
27483,XLIV.,"To feel, in friendless palaces, a home"
27484,XLIV.,"Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?"

27486,XLV.,XLV.
27487,XLV.,
27488,XLV.,"Early in years, and yet more infantine"
27489,XLV.,"In figure, she had something of Sublime"
27490,XLV.,"In eyes which sadly shone, as Seraphs' shine."
27491,XLV.,All Youth--but with an aspect beyond Time;
27492,XLV.,Radiant and grave--as pitying Man's decline;
27493,XLV.,"Mournful--but mournful of another's crime,"
27494,XLV.,"She looked as if she sat by Eden's door,"
27495,XLV.,And grieved for those who could return no more.
27496,XLV.,
27497,XLVI.,XLVI.
27498,XLVI.,
27499,XLVI.,"She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,"
27500,XLVI.,"As far as her own gentle heart allowed,"
27501,XLVI.,And deemed that fallen worship far more dear
27502,XLVI.,Perhaps because 't was fallen: her Sires were proud
27503,XLVI.,Of deeds and days when they had filled the ear
27504,XLVI.,"Of nations, and had never bent or bowed"
27505,XLVI.,"To novel power; and as she was the last,"
27506,XLVI.,She held their old faith and old feelings fast.
27507,XLVI.,
27508,XLVII.,XLVII.
27509,XLVII.,
27510,XLVII.,"She gazed upon a World she scarcely knew,"
27511,XLVII.,"As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,"
27512,XLVII.,"As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,"
27513,XLVII.,And kept her heart serene within its zone.
27514,XLVII.,There was awe in the homage which she drew;
27515,XLVII.,Her Spirit seemed as seated on a throne
27516,XLVII.,"Apart from the surrounding world, and strong"
27517,XLVII.,In its own strength--most strange in one so young!
27518,XLVII.,
27519,XLVIII.,XLVIII.
27520,XLVIII.,
27521,XLVIII.,"Now it so happened, in the catalogue"
27522,XLVIII.,"Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,"
27523,XLVIII.,"Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue,"
27524,XLVIII.,Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
27525,XLVIII.,Her beauty also seemed to form no clog
27526,XLVIII.,"Against her being mentioned as well fitted,"
27527,XLVIII.,"By many virtues, to be worth the trouble"
27528,XLVIII.,Of single gentlemen who would be double.
27529,XLVIII.,
27530,XLIX.,XLIX.
27531,XLIX.,
27532,XLIX.,"And this omission, like that of the bust"
27533,XLIX.,"Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,[750]"
27534,XLIX.,"Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must."
27535,XLIX.,This he expressed half smiling and half serious;
27536,XLIX.,"When Adeline replied with some disgust,"
27537,XLIX.,"And with an air, to say the least, imperious,"
27538,XLIX.,"She marvelled ""what he saw in such a baby"
27539,XLIX.,"As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?"""
27540,XLIX.,
27541,L.,L.
27542,L.,
27543,L.,"Juan rejoined--""She was a Catholic,"
27544,L.,"And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;"
27545,L.,"Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,"
27546,L.,"And the Pope thunder excommunication,"
27547,L.,"If--"" But here Adeline, who seemed to pique"
27548,L.,Herself extremely on the inoculation
27549,L.,"Of others with her own opinions, stated--"
27550,L.,As usual--the same reason which she late did.
27551,L.,
27552,LI.,LI.
27553,LI.,
27554,LI.,"And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,"
27555,LI.,"If good, is none the worse for repetition;"
27556,LI.,"If bad, the best way's certainly to tease on,"
27557,LI.,"And amplify: you lose much by concision,"
27558,LI.,Whereas insisting in or out of season
27559,LI.,"Convinces all men, even a politician;"
27560,LI.,Or--what is just the same--it wearies out.
27561,LI.,"So the end's gained, what signifies the route?"
27562,LI.,
27563,LII.,LII.
27564,LII.,
27565,LII.,_Why_ Adeline had this slight prejudice--
27566,LII.,For prejudice it was--against a creature
27567,LII.,"As pure, as Sanctity itself, from Vice,--"
27568,LII.,"With all the added charm of form and feature,--"
27569,LII.,"For me appears a question far too nice,"
27570,LII.,Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
27571,LII.,"But Nature's Nature, and has more caprices"
27572,LII.,"Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces."
27573,LII.,
27574,LIII.,LIII.
27575,LIII.,
27576,LIII.,Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
27577,LIII.,"With which Aurora on those baubles looked,"
27578,LIII.,Which charm most people in their earlier day:
27579,LIII.,"For there are few things by Mankind less brooked,"
27580,LIII.,"And Womankind too, if we so may say,"
27581,LIII.,"Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,"
27582,LIII.,"Like ""Antony's by Cæsar,""[751] by the few"
27583,LIII.,Who look upon them as they ought to do.
27584,LIII.,
27585,LIV.,LIV.
27586,LIV.,
27587,LIV.,It was not envy--Adeline had none;
27588,LIV.,"Her place was far beyond it, and her mind:"
27589,LIV.,It was not scorn--which could not light on one
27590,LIV.,Whose greatest _fault_ was leaving few to find:
27591,LIV.,"It was not jealousy, I think--but shun"
27592,LIV.,Following the _ignes fatui_ of Mankind:
27593,LIV.,"It was not----but 't is easier far, alas!"
27594,LIV.,To say what it was _not_ than what it was.
27595,LIV.,
27596,LV.,LV.

27598,LV.,Little Aurora deemed she was the theme
27599,LV.,Of such discussion. She was there a guest;
27600,LV.,A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
27601,LV.,"Of Rank and Youth, though purer than the rest,"
27602,LV.,Which flowed on for a moment in the beam
27603,LV.,Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.

27612,LVI.,Then turned unto the stars for loftier rays.
27613,LVI.,"Juan was something she could not divine,"
27614,LVI.,Being no Sibyl in the new world's ways;

27623,LVII.,Half virtues and whole vices being combined;

27625,LVII.,Follies tricked out so brightly that they blind:--
27626,LVII.,"These seals upon her wax made no impression,"

27634,LVIII.,"The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,"
27635,LVIII.,"More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,"
27636,LVIII.,"Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,"

27822,LXXV.,Also the conference which we have seen
27823,LXXV.,"Was not such as to encourage him to shine,"

27833,LXXVI.,"Like that same mystic music of the spheres,"
27834,LXXVI.,"Which no one hears, so loudly though it rings,"

27844,LXXVII.,"Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,"

27855,LXXVIII.,The Devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
27856,LXXVIII.,"Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?"

27861,LXXIX.,
27862,LXXIX.,"And looked as much as if to say, ""I said it;"""

27865,LXXIX.,"Both in the case of lover and of friend,"
27866,LXXIX.,"Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,"
27867,LXXIX.,To bring what was a jest to a serious end:
27868,LXXIX.,"For all men prophesy what _is_ or _was_,"
27869,LXXIX.,And hate those who won't let them come to pass.

27887,LXXXI.,Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--
27888,LXXXI.,"So very difficult, they say, it is"
27889,LXXXI.,"To keep extremes from meeting, when once set"
27890,LXXXI.,In motion; but she here too much refined--

27898,LXXXII.,As if each charming word were a decree.
27899,LXXXII.,"His tact, too, tempered him from grave to gay,"
27900,LXXXII.,And taught him when to be reserved or free:
27901,LXXXII.,"He had the art of drawing people out,"

27910,LXXXIII.,Commenced[759] (from such slight things will great commence)
27911,LXXXIII.,To feel that flattery which attracts the proud
27912,LXXXIII.,"Rather by deference than compliment,"

28607,XXII.,XXII.
28608,XXII.,
28609,XXII.,Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint

28613,XXII.,"Coined from surviving Superstition's mint,"
28614,XXII.,"Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,"

28620,XXIII.,"Once, twice, thrice passed, repassed--the thing of air,"

28623,XXIII.,"Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base"
28624,XXIII.,"As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair"
28625,XXIII.,Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;
28626,XXIII.,"He taxed his tongue for words, which were not granted,"

28629,XXIV.,XXIV.

28631,XXIV.,"The third time, after a still longer pause,"
28632,XXIV.,The shadow passed away--but where? the hall
28633,XXIV.,"Was long, and thus far there was no great cause"
28634,XXIV.,To think his vanishing unnatural:
28635,XXIV.,"Doors there were many, through which, by the laws"
28636,XXIV.,"Of physics, bodies whether short or tall"
28637,XXIV.,Might come or go; but Juan could not state
28638,XXIV.,Through which the Spectre seemed to evaporate.
28639,XXIV.,
28640,XXV.,XXV.
28641,XXV.,
28642,XXV.,"He stood--how long he knew not, but it seemed"
28643,XXV.,"An age--expectant, powerless, with his eyes"
28644,XXV.,Strained on the spot where first the figure gleamed
28645,XXV.,"Then by degrees recalled his energies,"
28646,XXV.,"And would have passed the whole off as a dream,"
28647,XXV.,"But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,"
28648,XXV.,"Waking already, and returned at length"

28650,XXV.,
28651,XXVI.,XXVI.
28652,XXVI.,
28653,XXVI.,All there was as he left it: still his taper
28654,XXVI.,"Burned, and not _blue_, as modest tapers use,"
28655,XXVI.,Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;
28656,XXVI.,"He rubbed his eyes, and they did not refuse"
28657,XXVI.,Their office: he took up an old newspaper;
28658,XXVI.,The paper was right easy to peruse;
28659,XXVI.,"He read an article the King attacking,"
28660,XXVI.,"And a long eulogy of ""Patent Blacking."""
28661,XXVI.,
28662,XXVII.,XXVII.
28663,XXVII.,
28664,XXVII.,This savoured of this world; but his hand shook:
28665,XXVII.,"He shut his door, and after having read"
28666,XXVII.,"A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,"
28667,XXVII.,"Undressed, and rather slowly went to bed."
28668,XXVII.,"There, couched all snugly on his pillow's nook,"
28669,XXVII.,With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;
28670,XXVII.,"And though it was no opiate, slumber crept"
28671,XXVII.,"Upon him by degrees, and so he slept."
28672,XXVII.,
28673,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
28674,XXVIII.,
28675,XXVIII.,"He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,"
28676,XXVIII.,"Pondered upon his visitant or vision,"
28677,XXVIII.,"And whether it ought not to be disclosed,"
28678,XXVIII.,At risk of being quizzed for superstition.
28679,XXVIII.,"The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:"
28680,XXVIII.,"In the mean time, his valet, whose precision"
28681,XXVIII.,"Was great, because his master brooked no less,"
28682,XXVIII.,Knocked to inform him it was time to dress.
28683,XXVIII.,
28684,XXIX.,XXIX.
28685,XXIX.,
28686,XXIX.,He dressed; and like young people he was wont
28687,XXIX.,"To take some trouble with his toilet, but"
28688,XXIX.,This morning rather spent less time upon 't;
28689,XXIX.,Aside his very mirror soon was put;
28690,XXIX.,"His curls fell negligently o'er his front,"
28691,XXIX.,"His clothes were not curbed to their usual cut,"
28692,XXIX.,His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
28693,XXIX.,Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.

28695,XXX.,XXX.
28696,XXX.,
28697,XXX.,"And when he walked down into the Saloon,"
28698,XXX.,"He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,"
28699,XXX.,"Which he perhaps had not discovered soon,"
28700,XXX.,"Had it not happened scalding hot to be,"
28701,XXX.,Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;
28702,XXX.,"So much _distrait_ he was, that all could see"

28706,XXXI.,XXXI.
28707,XXXI.,
28708,XXXI.,"She looked, and saw him pale, and turned as pale"

28710,XXXI.,"Something, but what's not stated in my tale."
28711,XXXI.,"Lord Henry said, his muffin was ill buttered;"
28712,XXXI.,"The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke played with her veil,"
28713,XXXI.,"And looked at Juan hard, but nothing uttered."
28714,XXXI.,Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes
28715,XXXI.,Surveyed him with a kind of calm surprise.
28716,XXXI.,
28717,XXXII.,XXXII.
28718,XXXII.,
28719,XXXII.,"But seeing him all cold and silent still,"
28720,XXXII.,"And everybody wondering more or less,"
28721,XXXII.,"Fair Adeline inquired, ""If he were ill?"""
28722,XXXII.,"He started, and said, ""Yes--no--rather--yes."""
28723,XXXII.,"The family physician had great skill,"
28724,XXXII.,"And being present, now began to express"
28725,XXXII.,His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
28726,XXXII.,"The cause, but Juan said, he was ""quite well."""
28727,XXXII.,
28728,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
28729,XXXIII.,
28730,XXXIII.,"""Quite well; yes,--no.""--These answers were mysterious,"
28731,XXXIII.,"And yet his looks appeared to sanction both,"
28732,XXXIII.,However they might savour of delirious;
28733,XXXIII.,Something like illness of a sudden growth
28734,XXXIII.,"Weighed on his spirit, though by no means serious:"
28735,XXXIII.,"But for the rest, as he himself seemed both"
28736,XXXIII.,"To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted"
28737,XXXIII.,It was not the physician that he wanted.
28738,XXXIII.,
28739,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
28740,XXXIV.,
28741,XXXIV.,"Lord Henry, who had now discussed his chocolate,"
28742,XXXIV.,"Also the muffin whereof he complained,"
28743,XXXIV.,"Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,"
28744,XXXIV.,"At which he marvelled, since it had not rained;"
28745,XXXIV.,Then asked her Grace what news were of the Duke of late?
28746,XXXIV.,"_Her_ Grace replied, _his_ Grace was rather pained"
28747,XXXIV.,"With some slight, light, hereditary twinges"
28748,XXXIV.,"Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges."
28749,XXXIV.,
28750,XXXV.,XXXV.
28751,XXXV.,
28752,XXXV.,"Then Henry turned to Juan, and addressed"

28754,XXXV.,"""You look,"" quoth he, ""as if you had had your rest"
28755,XXXV.,"Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late."""
28756,XXXV.,"""What Friar?"" said Juan; and he did his best"
28757,XXXV.,"To put the question with an air sedate,"
28758,XXXV.,Or careless; but the effort was not valid
28759,XXXV.,To hinder him from growing still more pallid.
28760,XXXV.,
28761,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
