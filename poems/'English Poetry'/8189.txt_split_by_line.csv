39,THE BRIDE,_Introductory Note_
40,THE BRIDE,
41,THE BRIDE,When the complete works of Samuel Rowlands were issued by the
42,THE BRIDE,"Hunterian Club in 1872-1880, in an edition of two hundred and ten copies,"
43,THE BRIDE,the Editor was obliged to omit from the collection the poem entitled
44,THE BRIDE,"""The Bride."" No copy of this tract was supposed to be extant. Twenty"
45,THE BRIDE,"years later, in the article on Rowlands in the Dictionary of National"
46,THE BRIDE,"Biography, Mr. Sidney Lee also names this poem as one of the author's"
47,THE BRIDE,lost works. All that was known of it was the entry in the Stationers'
48,THE BRIDE,"Register: [Footnote: _Arber's Transcript, vol. iii. p. 609_.]"
49,THE BRIDE,
50,THE BRIDE,"""22 [degrees] Maij 1617"
51,THE BRIDE,"""Master Pauier. Entred for his Copie vnder the handes"
52,THE BRIDE,"of master TAUERNOR and both the wardens, A Poeme"
53,THE BRIDE,"intituled _The Bride_, written by SAMUELL ROWLANDE vj'd."""
54,THE BRIDE,
55,THE BRIDE,"While all of Rowlands's works are classed by bibliographers as ""rare,"""
56,THE BRIDE,this one seemed to have disappeared entirely. No copy was to be
57,THE BRIDE,"found in any of the large libraries or private collections, nor was there"
58,THE BRIDE,any record of its sale.
59,THE BRIDE,
60,THE BRIDE,Last spring a copy was discovered in the catalogue of a bookseller in a
61,THE BRIDE,"small German town, and was secured for the Harvard College Library,"
62,THE BRIDE,"being purchased from the Child Memorial Fund. The copy is perfect,"
63,THE BRIDE,except that the inner corner at the top of the second and third leaves
64,THE BRIDE,"has been torn off, with the loss of parts of two words, which have"
65,THE BRIDE,been supplied in manuscript. From this copy the present reprint is
66,THE BRIDE,"made. As in the Hunterian Club edition of Rowlands's Works, to which"
67,THE BRIDE,"this may be considered a supplement, the reprint is exact. The general"
68,THE BRIDE,makeup of the book as to style and size of type has been followed as
69,THE BRIDE,closely as possible; and the text has been reproduced page for page
70,THE BRIDE,"and word for word. The misprints, which are unusually numerous, even"
71,THE BRIDE,"for a book of this period, have been left uncorrected. The title-page"
72,THE BRIDE,and the two head-pieces have been reproduced by photography.
73,THE BRIDE,
74,THE BRIDE,"Of the poem itself, since it is now before the reader, little need be"
75,THE BRIDE,said. It cannot be claimed that it presents great poetical merit.
76,THE BRIDE,"Rowlands at his best was but an indifferent poet,--hardly more"
77,THE BRIDE,"than a penny-a-liner. In his satirical pieces and epigrams, and in"
78,THE BRIDE,"that bit of genuine comedy, ""Tis Merrie vvhen Gossips meete,"" his"
79,THE BRIDE,"work does have a real literary value, and is distinctly interesting as"
80,THE BRIDE,presenting a vivid picture of London life at the beginning of the
81,THE BRIDE,"seventeenth century. In ""The Bride,"" it must be confessed, Rowlands"
82,THE BRIDE,falls below his own best work. Yet the poem is by no means wholly
83,THE BRIDE,"lacking in interest. If not his best work, ""The Bride"" is by no means"
84,THE BRIDE,"his worst. Like most of his poems, it is written in an heroic stanza"
85,THE BRIDE,"of six lines, and, as is not so common with him, is in dialogue form."
86,THE BRIDE,The dialogue for the most part is well sustained and sprightly. The
87,THE BRIDE,"story of the birth of Merlin, it is true, seems to have been inserted"
88,THE BRIDE,mainly to fill out the required number of pages; but this digression has an
89,THE BRIDE,"interest of its own, in that the name here given to Merlin's mother,"
90,THE BRIDE,"""Lady Adhan,"" does not appear in the ordinary versions of the legend."
91,THE BRIDE,
92,THE BRIDE,Of Rowlands's life almost nothing is known: that little is told in the
93,THE BRIDE,"Memoir by Mr. Gosse prefixed to the Hunterian Club edition, and by"
94,THE BRIDE,"Mr. Lee in the Dictionary of National Biography, and need not be"
95,THE BRIDE,repeated here. All that is known with certainty is that Samuel
96,THE BRIDE,"Rowlands was a writer of numerous poems and pamphlets, published"
97,THE BRIDE,between the years 1598 and 1628. During this period there appeared
98,THE BRIDE,"almost every year a pamphlet bearing his name or the well known initials,"
99,THE BRIDE,"""S. R."" Twenty-eight separate works, of which many passed through"
100,THE BRIDE,"several editions, are known to have been written by him. All of these"
101,THE BRIDE,early editions are rare; at least two of the works have been lost; several
102,THE BRIDE,"are extant only in the second or later editions; and of at least ten, only"
103,THE BRIDE,single copies are known to exist. Beside the edition of the Works already
104,THE BRIDE,"referred to, a number of Rowlands's tracts have been separately reprinted,"
105,THE BRIDE,"in limited editions, by Sir Walter Scott, by S. W. Singer, by"
106,THE BRIDE,"E. V. Utterson, by Halliwell-Phillipps, by J. P. Collier, and by"
107,THE BRIDE,E. F. Rimbault in the publications of the Percy Society; to this series
108,THE BRIDE,"of reprints, ""The Bride"" is now added."

818,THE BRIDE,"That Lady _Adhan_ giues vnto you all,"
819,THE BRIDE,"Were you not better marriage to allow,"
820,THE BRIDE,Then in a manner for a Midwife call:
821,THE BRIDE,"I thinke you were if I might iudge the cause,"
822,THE BRIDE,"How say you _Susan_, speake good _Doll_ and _Grace_."
823,THE BRIDE,
824,THE BRIDE,_Grace_.
825,THE BRIDE,
826,THE BRIDE,"This is a story that seemes very strange,"
827,THE BRIDE,"And for my part, it doth me full perswade,"
828,THE BRIDE,"My Mayden-head with some man to exchange,"
829,THE BRIDE,I will not liue in danger of a mayde:
830,THE BRIDE,"The world the flesh, the diuell tempts vs still,"
831,THE BRIDE,"Ile haue a husband, I protest I will."
832,THE BRIDE,
833,THE BRIDE,"If I were sure none of you here would blabbe,"

835,THE BRIDE,"And if I lye, count me the veriest drabbe,"
836,THE BRIDE,That euer any of you saw or knewe:
837,THE BRIDE,When a friend speakes in kindnes do not wrong her:
838,THE BRIDE,For I can keepe it (for my life) no longer.
839,THE BRIDE,
840,THE BRIDE,One night (I haue the day of moneth set downe)
841,THE BRIDE,"Because I will make serious matters sure,"
842,THE BRIDE,"Me thought I went a iourney out of towne,"
843,THE BRIDE,And with a propper man I was made sure:
844,THE BRIDE,"As sure as death, me thought we were assured,"
845,THE BRIDE,And all things for the businesse were procured.
846,THE BRIDE,
847,THE BRIDE,"We did agree, and faith and troath did plight,"
848,THE BRIDE,"And he gaue me, and I gaue him a Ring,"
849,THE BRIDE,"To doe as _Mistris Bride_ will doe at night,"
850,THE BRIDE,And I protest me thought he did the thing:
851,THE BRIDE,"The thing we stand so much vpon he tooke,"
852,THE BRIDE,And I vpon the matter bigge did looke.
853,THE BRIDE,
854,THE BRIDE,"Forsooth (in sadnes,) I was bigge with childe,"
855,THE BRIDE,"And had a belly, (marry God forbid,)"
856,THE BRIDE,"Then fell a weeping, but he laught and smil'd,"
857,THE BRIDE,"And boldly said, weele stand to what we did:"
858,THE BRIDE,"Fye, fye (quoth I) who euer stands I fall,"
859,THE BRIDE,"Farewell my credit, maydenhead and all."
860,THE BRIDE,
861,THE BRIDE,"Thus as I cry'd and wept and wrong my hands,"
862,THE BRIDE,"And said deare maydes and maydenhead adue,"
863,THE BRIDE,"Before my face me thought my mother stands,"
864,THE BRIDE,And question'd with me how this matter grew:
865,THE BRIDE,"With that I start awake as we are now,"
866,THE BRIDE,Yet feard my dreame had bin no dreame I vow.
867,THE BRIDE,
868,THE BRIDE,"I could not (for my life) tell how to take it,"
869,THE BRIDE,"For I was stricken in a mightie maze,"
870,THE BRIDE,"Therefore if marriage come Ile not forsake it,"
871,THE BRIDE,"Tis danger to liue virgin diuers wayes,"
872,THE BRIDE,"I would not in such feare againe be found,"
873,THE BRIDE,"Without a husband, for a thousand pound."
874,THE BRIDE,

880,THE BRIDE,"And would haue had me bin his turtle mate,"
881,THE BRIDE,"You cunningly did make me to forsake him,"
882,THE BRIDE,Because I thinke in conscience you will take him.
883,THE BRIDE,
884,THE BRIDE,"Ile trust your word another time againe,"
885,THE BRIDE,"That can dissemble so against your heart,"
886,THE BRIDE,"Wishing that I should earnestly refraine,"

902,THE BRIDE,"Must note eight duties doe concerne a wife,"
903,THE BRIDE,To vvhich vvith all endeuour she must frame:
904,THE BRIDE,"And so in peace possesse her husbands loue,"
905,THE BRIDE,And all distast from both their hearts remooue.
906,THE BRIDE,
907,THE BRIDE,"The first is that she haue domestique cares,"
908,THE BRIDE,"Of priuate businesse for the house vvithin,"
909,THE BRIDE,"Leauing her husband vnto his affaires,"
910,THE BRIDE,Of things abroad that out of doores haue bin:
911,THE BRIDE,"By him performed as his charge to doe,"
912,THE BRIDE,Not busie-body like inclin'd thereto.
913,THE BRIDE,
914,THE BRIDE,"Nor intermedling as a number will,"
915,THE BRIDE,"Of foolish gossips, such as doe neglect,"
916,THE BRIDE,"The things which doe concerne them, and too ill,"
917,THE BRIDE,Presume in matters vnto no effect:
918,THE BRIDE,"Beyond their element, when they should looke,"
919,THE BRIDE,To what is done in Kitchin by the Cooke.
920,THE BRIDE,
921,THE BRIDE,"Or vnto childrens vertuous education,"
922,THE BRIDE,"Or to their maides that they good huswiues be,"
923,THE BRIDE,"And carefully containe a decent fashion,"
924,THE BRIDE,That nothing passe the lymmits of degree:
925,THE BRIDE,"Knowing her husbands businesse from her own,"
926,THE BRIDE,"And diligent doe that, let his alone."
927,THE BRIDE,
928,THE BRIDE,"The second dutie of the wife is this,"
929,THE BRIDE,(Which shee in minde ought very carefull beare)
930,THE BRIDE,"To entertaine in house such friends of his,"
931,THE BRIDE,As she doth know haue husbands welcome there:
932,THE BRIDE,"Not her acquaintance without his consent,"
933,THE BRIDE,For that way Iealousie breeds discontent.
934,THE BRIDE,
935,THE BRIDE,"An honest woman will the scandall shun,"
936,THE BRIDE,"Of that report is made of wantonnesse,"
937,THE BRIDE,"And feare her credit will to ruine run,"
938,THE BRIDE,When euill speakers doe her shame expresse:
939,THE BRIDE,"And therefore from this rule a practise drawes,"
940,THE BRIDE,"That the effect may cease, remoue the cause."
941,THE BRIDE,
942,THE BRIDE,"Th'ird dutie is, that of no proude pretence,"
943,THE BRIDE,"She moue her husband to consume his meanes,"
944,THE BRIDE,"With vrging him to needlesse vaine expence,"

950,THE BRIDE,"And decently vnto her calling goe,"
951,THE BRIDE,"Not diuing in the frugall purse too deepe,"
952,THE BRIDE,By making to the world a pecocke showe:
953,THE BRIDE,"Though they seeme fooles, so yeelde vnto their wiues,"
954,THE BRIDE,Some poore men doe it to haue quiet liues.
955,THE BRIDE,
956,THE BRIDE,"Fourth dutie is, to loue her owne house best,"
957,THE BRIDE,"And be no gadding gossippe vp and downe,"
958,THE BRIDE,"To heare and carry tales amongst the rest,"
959,THE BRIDE,That are the newes reporters of the towne:
960,THE BRIDE,"A modest vvomans home is her delight,"
961,THE BRIDE,"Of businesse there, to haue the ouersight."
962,THE BRIDE,
963,THE BRIDE,"At publike playes she neuer will be knowne,"
964,THE BRIDE,"And to be tauerne guest she euer hates,"
965,THE BRIDE,"Shee scornes to be a streete-wife (Idle one,)"
966,THE BRIDE,Or field vvife ranging vvith her vvalking mates:
967,THE BRIDE,"She knows how wise men censure of such dames,"
968,THE BRIDE,And how with blottes they blemish their good names.
969,THE BRIDE,
970,THE BRIDE,"And therefore with the doue sheele rather choose,"
971,THE BRIDE,"To make aboade where she hath dwelling place,"
972,THE BRIDE,"Or like the snayle that shelly house doeth vse,"
973,THE BRIDE,"For shelter still, such is good-huswiues case:"
974,THE BRIDE,"Respecting residence where she doth loue,"
975,THE BRIDE,"As those good housholders, the snayle and doue."
976,THE BRIDE,
977,THE BRIDE,"Fift dutie of a wife vnto her head,"
978,THE BRIDE,"Is her ohedience to reforme his will,"
979,THE BRIDE,"And neuer with a selfe conceit be led,"
980,THE BRIDE,"That her aduise prooues good, his counsell ill:"
981,THE BRIDE,"In Iudgement being singular alone,"
982,THE BRIDE,"As hauing all the wit, her husband none."
983,THE BRIDE,
984,THE BRIDE,"She must not thinke her wisedome to be thus,"
985,THE BRIDE,(For we alasie are weakelings vnto men)
986,THE BRIDE,"What singular good thing remaines in vs,"
987,THE BRIDE,"Of wife ones in a thousand, show me ten,"
988,THE BRIDE,"Her stocke of wit, that hath the most (I say,)"
989,THE BRIDE,Hath scarse enough for spending euery day.
990,THE BRIDE,
991,THE BRIDE,"When as the husband bargaines hath to make,"
992,THE BRIDE,"In things that are depending on his trade,"
993,THE BRIDE,"Let not wifes boldnes, power vnto her take,"
994,THE BRIDE,As though no match were good but what she made
995,THE BRIDE,"For she that thus hath oare in husbands boate,"
996,THE BRIDE,"Let her take breech, and giue him petti-coate."
997,THE BRIDE,
998,THE BRIDE,"Sixt dutie is, to pacific his yre,"
999,THE BRIDE,"although she finde that he empatient be,"
1000,THE BRIDE,"For hasty words, like fuell adde to fire,"
1001,THE BRIDE,"And more, and more insenceth wraths degree:"
1002,THE BRIDE,"When she perceiues his choller in a fit,"
1003,THE BRIDE,"Let her forbeare, and that's a signe of wit."
1004,THE BRIDE,

1006,THE BRIDE,"Of aduerse crosses, woemen not conceiue,"
1007,THE BRIDE,"To find vs honny, they doe meete with gall,"
1008,THE BRIDE,"Their toyle for vs, doe their owne ioyes bereaue:"
1009,THE BRIDE,"Great shame it were, that we should ad their woe,"
1010,THE BRIDE,"That doe maintaine, and keepe, and loue vs so."
1011,THE BRIDE,
1012,THE BRIDE,"If that a hasty word sometime be spoke,"
1013,THE BRIDE,"Let vs not censure therefore they are foes,"
1014,THE BRIDE,"Say tis infirmitie that doth prouoke,"
1015,THE BRIDE,Their hearts are sorry for their tongues God knowes:
1016,THE BRIDE,"Since we by proofe each day and hower finde,"
1017,THE BRIDE,"For one harsh word, they giue ten thousand kind"
1018,THE BRIDE,
1019,THE BRIDE,"The seuenth dutie that she must endeauour,"

1038,THE BRIDE,Sould cause the wife to haue a blushing face.
1039,THE BRIDE,
1040,THE BRIDE,"The eight last dutie she must take vpon her,"
