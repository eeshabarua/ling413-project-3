57,THE CRANE,THE CRANE
58,THE CRANE,
59,THE CRANE,"The biggest crane on earth, it lifts"
60,THE CRANE,Two hundred ton more easily
61,THE CRANE,Than I can lift my heavy head:
62,THE CRANE,"And when it swings, the whole world shifts,"
63,THE CRANE,"Or so, at least, it seems to me,"
64,THE CRANE,"As, day and night, adream I lie"
65,THE CRANE,"Upon my crippled back in bed,"
66,THE CRANE,And watch it up against the sky.
67,THE CRANE,
68,THE CRANE,"My mother, hunching in her chair,"
69,THE CRANE,"Day-long, and stitching trousers there--"
70,THE CRANE,At three-and-three the dozen pair...
71,THE CRANE,"She’d sit all night, and stitch for me,"
72,THE CRANE,"Her son, if I could only wear..."
73,THE CRANE,She never lifts her eyes to see
74,THE CRANE,The big crane swinging through the air.
75,THE CRANE,
76,THE CRANE,"But, though she has no time to talk,"
77,THE CRANE,"She always cleans the window-pane,"
78,THE CRANE,"That I may see it, clear and plain:"
79,THE CRANE,"And, as I watch it move, I walk"
80,THE CRANE,Who never walked in all my days...
81,THE CRANE,"And, often, as I dream agaze,"
82,THE CRANE,I’m up and out: and it is I
83,THE CRANE,Who swing the crane across the sky.
84,THE CRANE,"Right up above the wharf I stand,"
85,THE CRANE,"And touch a lever with my hand,"
86,THE CRANE,"To lift a bunch of girders high,"
87,THE CRANE,"A truck of coal, a field of grain"
88,THE CRANE,"In sacks, a bundle of big trees,"
89,THE CRANE,"Or beasts, too frightened in my grip"
90,THE CRANE,To wonder at their skiey trip:
91,THE CRANE,And then I let the long arm dip
92,THE CRANE,"Without a hitch, without a slip,"
93,THE CRANE,To set them safely in the ship
94,THE CRANE,That waits to take them overseas.
95,THE CRANE,
96,THE CRANE,"My mother little dreams it’s I,"
97,THE CRANE,"Up there, as tiny as a fly,"
98,THE CRANE,"Who stand above the biggest crane,"
99,THE CRANE,And swing the ship-loads through the sky;
100,THE CRANE,"While she sits, hunching in her chair,"
101,THE CRANE,"Day-long, and stitching trousers there--"
102,THE CRANE,At three-and-three the dozen pair.
103,THE CRANE,
104,THE CRANE,"And sometimes when it turns me dizzy,"
105,THE CRANE,"I lie and watch her, ever busy;"
106,THE CRANE,And wonder at a lot of things
107,THE CRANE,I never speak to her about:
108,THE CRANE,I wonder why she never sings
109,THE CRANE,Like other people on the stair...
110,THE CRANE,"And why, whenever she goes out"
111,THE CRANE,"Upon a windy day, the air"
112,THE CRANE,Makes her sad eyes so strangely bright...
113,THE CRANE,And if the colour of her hair
114,THE CRANE,"Was brown like mine, or always white..."
115,THE CRANE,"And why, when through the noise of feet"
116,THE CRANE,"Of people passing in the street,"
117,THE CRANE,"She hears a dog yelp or sheep bleat,"
118,THE CRANE,"She always starts up in her chair,"
119,THE CRANE,"And looks before her with strange stare,"
120,THE CRANE,"Yet, seeing nothing anywhere:"
121,THE CRANE,"Though, right before her, through the sky,"
122,THE CRANE,The biggest crane goes swinging by.
123,THE CRANE,
124,THE CRANE,"But, it’s a lucky day and rare"
125,THE CRANE,When she’s the time to talk with me...
126,THE CRANE,"Though, only yesterday, when night"
127,THE CRANE,"Shut out, at last, the crane from sight..."
128,THE CRANE,"She, in her bed, and thinking I"
129,THE CRANE,"Was sleeping--though I watch the sky,"
130,THE CRANE,"At times, till it is morning-light,"
131,THE CRANE,And ships are waiting to unload--
132,THE CRANE,I heard her murmur drowsily:
133,THE CRANE,"""The pit-pat-pattering of feet,"
134,THE CRANE,"All night, along the moonlit road..."
135,THE CRANE,"A yelp, a whistle, and a bleat..."
136,THE CRANE,The bracken’s deep and soft and dry...
137,THE CRANE,"And safe and snug, and no one near..."
138,THE CRANE,"The little burn sings low and sweet,"
139,THE CRANE,The little burn sings shrill and clear...
140,THE CRANE,And loud all night the cock-grouse talks...
141,THE CRANE,There’s naught in heaven or earth to fear...
142,THE CRANE,The pit-pat-pattering of feet...
143,THE CRANE,"A yelp, a whistle, and a bleat..."""
144,THE CRANE,"And then, she started up in bed:"
145,THE CRANE,"I felt her staring, as she said:"
146,THE CRANE,"""I wonder if he ever hears"
147,THE CRANE,"The pit-pat-pattering of sheep,"
148,THE CRANE,Or smells the broken bracken stalks...
149,THE CRANE,While she is lying sound-asleep
150,THE CRANE,Beside him ... after all these years--
151,THE CRANE,"Just nineteen years, this very night--"
152,THE CRANE,"Remembering? ... and now, his son,"
153,THE CRANE,"A man ... and never stood upright!"""
154,THE CRANE,
155,THE CRANE,"And then, I heard a sound of tears;"
156,THE CRANE,"But dared not speak, or let her know"
157,THE CRANE,"I’d caught a single whisper, though"
158,THE CRANE,I wondered long what she had done
159,THE CRANE,That she should fear the pattering feet:
160,THE CRANE,And when those queer words in the night
161,THE CRANE,"Had fretted me half-dead with fright,"
162,THE CRANE,And set my throbbing head abeat...
163,THE CRANE,"Out of the darkness, suddenly,"
164,THE CRANE,"The crane’s long arm swung over me,"
165,THE CRANE,"Among the stars, high overhead..."
166,THE CRANE,"And then it dipped, and clutched my bed"
167,THE CRANE,"And I had not a breath to cry,"
168,THE CRANE,"Before it swung me through the sky,"
169,THE CRANE,"Above the sleeping city high,"
170,THE CRANE,Where blinding stars went blazing by...
171,THE CRANE,
172,THE CRANE,"My mother, hunching in her chair,"
173,THE CRANE,"Day-long, and stitching trousers there,"
174,THE CRANE,"At three-and-three the dozen pair,"
175,THE CRANE,With quiet eyes and smooth white hair...
176,THE CRANE,You’d little think a yelp or bleat
177,THE CRANE,Could start her; or that she was weeping
178,THE CRANE,"So sorely, when she thought me sleeping."
179,THE CRANE,She never tells me why she fears
180,THE CRANE,The pit-pat-pattering of feet
181,THE CRANE,All night along the moonlit road...
182,THE CRANE,Or what’s the wrong that she has done...
183,THE CRANE,"I wonder if ’twould bring her tears,"
184,THE CRANE,"If she could know that I, her son--"
185,THE CRANE,"A man, who never stood upright,"
186,THE CRANE,"But all the livelong day must lie,"
187,THE CRANE,"And watch, beyond the window-pane"
188,THE CRANE,The swaying of the biggest crane--
189,THE CRANE,"That I, within its clutch, last night,"
190,THE CRANE,Went whirling through the starry sky.
191,THE CRANE,

195,THE LIGHTHOUSE,THE LIGHTHOUSE
196,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
197,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Just as my watch was done, the fog had lifted;"
198,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And we could see the flashing of our light;
199,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And see, once more, the reef beyond the Head,"
200,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"O’er which, six days and nights, the mist had drifted--"
201,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Six days and nights in thick white mist had drifted,"
202,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Until it seemed all time to mist had drifted,"
203,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And day and night were but one blind white night.
204,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
205,THE LIGHTHOUSE,But on the seventh midnight the wind shifted:
206,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And I was glad to tumble into bed,"
207,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Thankful to hear no more the blaring horn,"
208,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"That ceaselessly had sounded, night and morn,"
209,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"With moaning echoes through the mist, to warn"
210,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The blind, bewildered ships at sea:"
211,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Yet, though as tired as any dog,"
212,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I lay awhile, and seemed to feel"
213,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Fog lying on my eyes still heavily;
214,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And still, the horn unceasingly"
215,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Sang through my head, till gradually"
216,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Through night’s strange stillness, over me"
217,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Sweet sleep began to steal,"
218,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Sleep, blind and thick and fleecy as the fog."
219,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
220,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"For all I knew, I might have slept"
221,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"A moment, or eternity;"
222,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"When, startled by a crash,"
223,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I waked to find I’d leapt
224,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Upright on the floor:
225,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And stood there, listening to the smash"
226,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Of falling glass ... and then a thud
227,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Of something heavy tumbling
228,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Into the next room...
229,THE LIGHTHOUSE,A pad of naked feet...
230,THE LIGHTHOUSE,A moan ... a sound of stumbling ...
231,THE LIGHTHOUSE,A heavier thud ... and then no more.
232,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And I stood shivering in the gloom,"
233,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"With creeping flesh, and tingling blood,"
234,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Until I gave myself a shake
235,THE LIGHTHOUSE,To bring my wits more wide awake;
236,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And lit a lantern, and flung wide the door."
237,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Half-dazed, and dazzled by the light,"
238,THE LIGHTHOUSE,At first it seemed I’d only find
239,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"A broken pane, a flapping blind:"
240,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But when I raised the lantern o’er my head,"
241,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I saw a naked boy upon the bed,"
242,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Who crouched and shuddered on the folded sheet;
243,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, on his face, before my feet,"
244,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"A naked man, who lay as if quite dead,"
245,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Though on his broken knuckles blood was red:
246,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And all my wits awakened at the sight.
247,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
248,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I set the lantern down; and took the child,"
249,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Who looked at me, with piteous eyes and wild;"
250,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And chafed his chill, wet body, till it glowed;"
251,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And forcing spirit ’twixt his chattering teeth,"
252,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I tucked him snugly in beneath
253,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The blankets, and soon left him warmly stowed:"
254,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And stooped to tend the man, who lay"
255,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Still senseless on the floor.
256,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
257,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I turned him off his face;
258,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And laid him on the other bed;
259,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And washed and staunched his wound.
260,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And yet for all that I could do,"
261,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I could not bring him to,"
262,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Or see a trace
263,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Of life returning to that heavy head.
264,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
265,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"It seemed he’d swooned,"
266,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"When through the window he’d made way,"
267,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Just having strength to lay
268,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The boy in safety.  Still as death,"
269,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"He lay, without a breath:"
270,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And seeing I could do no more
271,THE LIGHTHOUSE,To help him in the fight for life;
272,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I turned again to tend the lad;
273,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, as I looked on him, was glad"
274,THE LIGHTHOUSE,To find him sleeping quietly.
275,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
276,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"So, fetching fuel, I lit a fire:"
277,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And quickly had as big a blaze
278,THE LIGHTHOUSE,As any housewife could desire:
279,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Then, ’twixt the beds, I set a chair,"
280,THE LIGHTHOUSE,That I might watch until they stirred:
281,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And as I saw them lying there--
282,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The sleeping boy, and him who lay"
283,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"In that strange stiller sleep, ’twas plain"
284,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"That they were son and father, now"
285,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I’d time to look, and wonder how,"
286,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"In such a desperate plight,"
287,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Without a stitch or rag,"
288,THE LIGHTHOUSE,They’d taken refuge from the night.
289,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, as I wondered drowsily,"
290,THE LIGHTHOUSE,It seemed yet queerer and more queer;
291,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"For round the Head the rocks are sheer,"
292,THE LIGHTHOUSE,With scarce a foothold for a bird;
293,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And it seemed quite beyond belief
294,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"That any wrecked upon the reef,"
295,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Could swim ashore, and scale the crag,"
296,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"By daylight, let alone by night"
297,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
298,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But, they who live beside the sea"
299,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Know naught’s too wonderful to be:
300,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, as I sat, and heard"
301,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The quiet breathing of the child,"
302,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Great weariness came over me;
303,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, in a kind of daze,"
304,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I watched the blaze,"
305,THE LIGHTHOUSE,With nodding head:
306,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And must have slept, for, presently,"
307,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I found the man was sitting up in bed:
308,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And talking to himself, with wide, unseeing eyes."
309,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"At first, I hardly made out what he said:"
310,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But soon his voice, so hoarse and wild,"
311,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Grew calm: and, straining, I could hear"
312,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The broken words, that came with many sighs."
313,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
314,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"""Yes, lad: she’s going: but, there’s naught to fear:"
315,THE LIGHTHOUSE,For I can swim: and tow you in the belt.
316,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Come, let’s join hands together; and leap clear..."
317,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Aye, son: it’s dark and cold ... but you have felt"
318,THE LIGHTHOUSE,The cold and dark before...
319,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And you should scorn...
320,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And we must be near shore...
321,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"For, hark the horn!"
322,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Think of your mother, and your home, and leap..."
323,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"She thinks of us, lad, waking or asleep..."
324,THE LIGHTHOUSE,You would not leave her lonely?
325,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Nay! ... then ... go! ...
326,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Well done, lad! ... Nay!  I’m here..."
327,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Aye, son, it’s cold: but you’re too big to fear."
328,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Now then, you’re snug: I’ve got you safe in tow:"
329,THE LIGHTHOUSE,The worst is over: and we’ve only
330,THE LIGHTHOUSE,To make for land ... we’ve naught ... to do ... but steer...
331,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But steer ... but steer..."""
332,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
333,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"He paused; and sank down in the bed, quite done:"
334,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And lay a moment silent, while his son"
335,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Still slumbered in the other bed,"
336,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And on his quiet face the firelight shone.
337,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Then, once again, the father raised his head,"
338,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And rambled on...
339,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"""Say, lad, what cheer?"
340,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I thought you’d dropped asleep: but you’re all right.
341,THE LIGHTHOUSE,We’ll rest a moment ... I’m quite out of breath...
342,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"It’s further than ... Nay, son! there’s naught to fear..."
343,THE LIGHTHOUSE,The land must be quite near...
344,THE LIGHTHOUSE,The horn is loud enough!
345,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Aye, lad, it’s cold:"
346,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But, you’re too old"
347,THE LIGHTHOUSE,To cry for cold.
348,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Now ... keep ... tight hold:
349,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And we’ll be off again.
350,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I’ve got my breath..."""
351,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
352,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"He sank, once more, as still as death,"
353,THE LIGHTHOUSE,With hands that clutched the counterpane:
354,THE LIGHTHOUSE,But still the boy was sleeping quietly.
355,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And then, the father sat up suddenly:"
356,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And cried: ""See!  See!"
357,THE LIGHTHOUSE,The land! the land!
358,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"It’s near ... I touch it with my hand."""
359,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And now, ""Oh God!"" he moaned."
360,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Small wonder, when he saw what lay before--"
361,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The black, unbroken crags, so grim and high,"
362,THE LIGHTHOUSE,That must have seemed to him to soar
363,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Sheer from the sea’s edge to the sky.
364,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But, soon, he plucked up heart, once more:"
365,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"""We’re safe, lad--safe ashore!"
366,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"A narrow ledge, but land, firm land."
367,THE LIGHTHOUSE,We’ll soon be high and dry.
368,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Nay, son: we can’t stay here:"
369,THE LIGHTHOUSE,The waves would have us back;
370,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Or we should perish of the cold.
371,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Come, lad: there’s naught to fear..."
372,THE LIGHTHOUSE,You must be brave and bold.
373,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Perhaps, we’ll strike a track."
374,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Aye, son: it’s steep, and black,"
375,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And slimy to the hold:
376,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But we must climb, and see! the mist is gone."
377,THE LIGHTHOUSE,The stars are shining clear...
378,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Think, son, your mother’s at the top;"
379,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And you’ll be up in no time.  See, that star,"
380,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The brightest star that ever shone,"
381,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Just think it’s she who watches you;
382,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And knows that you’ll be brave and true.
383,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Come, lad: we may not stop..."
384,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Or, else, the cold..."
385,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Give me your hand...
386,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Your foot there, now ... just room to stand."
387,THE LIGHTHOUSE,It cannot be so far...
388,THE LIGHTHOUSE,We’ll soon be up ... this work should make us warm.
389,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Thank God, it’s not a storm,"
390,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Or we should scarce ... your foot, here, firm..."
391,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Nay, lad! you must not squirm."
392,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Come, be a man: you shall not fall:"
393,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I’ll hold you tight.
394,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"There: now, you are my own son, after all!"
395,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Your mother, lad,"
396,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Her star burns bright...
397,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And we’re already half-way up the height...
398,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Your mother will be glad,"
399,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Aye, she’ll be glad to hear"
400,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Of her brave boy who had no fear.
401,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
402,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Your foot ... your hand ... ’twas but a bird
403,THE LIGHTHOUSE,You startled out of bed:
404,THE LIGHTHOUSE,’Twould think it queer
405,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"To wake up, suddenly, and see your head!"
406,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, when you stirred..."
407,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Nay! steady, lad!"
408,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Or you will send your dad...
409,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Your hand ... your foot ... we’ll rest upon this ledge...
410,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Why, son, we’re at the top!  I feel the edge,"
411,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And grass, soft, dewy grass!"
412,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Let go, one moment; and I’ll draw you up..."
413,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Now, lad! ... Thank God! that’s past..."
414,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And you are safe, at last:"
415,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"You’re safe, you’re safe ... and now, my precious lass"
416,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Will see her son, her little son, again."
417,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
418,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I never thought to reach the top, to-night."
419,THE LIGHTHOUSE,God!  What a height!
420,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Nay! but you must not look: ’twould turn your head
421,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And we must not stand shivering here...
422,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And see ... a flashing light...
423,THE LIGHTHOUSE,It’s sweeping towards us: and now you stand bright.
424,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Ah, your poor, bleeding hands and feet!"
425,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"My little son, my sweet!"
426,THE LIGHTHOUSE,There’s nothing more to fear.
427,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"A lighthouse, lad!  And we must make for it."
428,THE LIGHTHOUSE,You’re tired; I’ll carry you a bit.
429,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Nay, son: ’twill warm me up..."
430,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And there will be a fire and bed;
431,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And ev’n perhaps a cup
432,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Of something hot to drink,"
433,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And something good to eat.
434,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And think, son, only think,"
435,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Your home ... and mother ... once again."""
436,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
437,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Once more, the weary head"
438,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Sank back upon the bed:
439,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, for a while, he hardly stirred;"
440,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"But only muttered, now and then,"
441,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"A broken word,"
442,THE LIGHTHOUSE,As though to cheer
443,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"His son, who still slept quietly,"
444,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Upon the other side of me.
445,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
446,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And then, my blood ran cold to hear"
447,THE LIGHTHOUSE,A sudden cry of fear:
448,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"""My son!  My son!"
449,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Ah, God, he’s done!"
450,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I thought I’d laid him on the bed...
451,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"I’ve laid him on white mist, instead:"
452,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"He’s fallen sheer..."""
453,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
454,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Then, I sprang up; and cried: ""Your son is here!"""
455,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, taking up the sleeping boy,"
456,THE LIGHTHOUSE,I bore him to his father’s arms:
457,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, as he nestled to his breast,"
458,THE LIGHTHOUSE,Kind life came back to those wild eyes;
459,THE LIGHTHOUSE,And filled them with deep joy:
460,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"And, free of all alarms,"
461,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"The son and father lay,"
462,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"Together, in sweet rest,"
463,THE LIGHTHOUSE,"While through the window stole the strange, clear light of day."
464,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
465,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
466,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
467,THE LIGHTHOUSE,
468,THE MONEY,THE MONEY
469,THE MONEY,
470,THE MONEY,They found her cold upon the bed.
471,THE MONEY,"The cause of death, the doctor said,"
472,THE MONEY,Was nothing save the lack of bread.
473,THE MONEY,
474,THE MONEY,Her clothes were but a sorry rag
475,THE MONEY,That barely hid the nakedness
476,THE MONEY,Of her poor body’s piteous wreck:
477,THE MONEY,"Yet, when they stripped her of her dress,"
478,THE MONEY,They found she was not penniless;
479,THE MONEY,"For, in a little silken bag,"
480,THE MONEY,"Tied with red ribbon round her neck,"
481,THE MONEY,Was four-pound-seventeen-and-five.
482,THE MONEY,
483,THE MONEY,"""It seems a strange and shameful thing"
484,THE MONEY,"That she should starve herself to death,"
485,THE MONEY,While she’d the means to keep alive.
486,THE MONEY,"Why, such a sum would keep the breath"
487,THE MONEY,Within her body till she’d found
488,THE MONEY,A livelihood; and it would bring...
489,THE MONEY,"But, there is very little doubt"
490,THE MONEY,She’d set her heart upon a grand
491,THE MONEY,And foolish funeral--for the pride
492,THE MONEY,"Of poor folk, who can understand!--"
493,THE MONEY,"And so, because she was too proud"
494,THE MONEY,"To meet death penniless, she died."""
495,THE MONEY,
496,THE MONEY,"And talking, talking, they trooped out:"
497,THE MONEY,"And, as they went, I turned about"
498,THE MONEY,To look upon her in her shroud;
499,THE MONEY,And saw again the quiet face
500,THE MONEY,"That filled with light that shameful place,"
501,THE MONEY,"Touched with the tender, youthful grace"
502,THE MONEY,Death brings the broken and outworn
503,THE MONEY,To comfort kind hearts left to mourn.
504,THE MONEY,
505,THE MONEY,"And as I stood, the sum they’d found"
506,THE MONEY,"Rang with a queer, familiar ring"
507,THE MONEY,"Of some uncouth, uncanny sound"
508,THE MONEY,Heard in dark ages underground;
509,THE MONEY,"And ""four-pound-seventeen-and-five"""
510,THE MONEY,"Through all my body seemed to sing,"
511,THE MONEY,Without recalling anything
512,THE MONEY,"To help me, strive as I might strive."
513,THE MONEY,
514,THE MONEY,"But, as I stumbled down the stairs"
515,THE MONEY,Into the alley’s gloom and stench--
516,THE MONEY,A whiff of burning oil
517,THE MONEY,That took me unawares--
518,THE MONEY,And I knew all there was to tell.
519,THE MONEY,"And, though the rain in torrents fell,"
520,THE MONEY,"I walked on, heedless, through the drench"
521,THE MONEY,"And, all the while, I seemed to sit"
522,THE MONEY,Upon a tub in Lansel pit;
523,THE MONEY,And in the candle-light to see
524,THE MONEY,"John Askerton, a ""deputy,"""
525,THE MONEY,"Who paused awhile to talk with me,"
526,THE MONEY,His kind face glistening black with toil.
527,THE MONEY,
528,THE MONEY,"""’Twas here I found him dead, beside"
529,THE MONEY,His engine.  All the other men
530,THE MONEY,Were up--for things were slack just then--
531,THE MONEY,And I’d one foot upon the cage;
532,THE MONEY,"When, all at once, I caught the smell"
533,THE MONEY,Of burning.  Even as I turned
534,THE MONEY,"To see what it could be that burned,"
535,THE MONEY,The seam behind was choked with stife.
536,THE MONEY,"And so I dropped on hands and knees,"
537,THE MONEY,"And crawled along the gallery,"
538,THE MONEY,"Beneath the smoke, that I might see"
539,THE MONEY,"What ailed: and as I crept, half-blind,"
540,THE MONEY,"With smarting eyes, and breath awheeze,"
541,THE MONEY,I scarcely knew what I should find.
542,THE MONEY,"At times, I thought I’d never know..."
543,THE MONEY,And ’twas already quite an age
544,THE MONEY,Since I set out ... I felt as though
545,THE MONEY,I had been crawling all my life
546,THE MONEY,Beneath the stifling cloud of smoke
547,THE MONEY,That clung about me fit to choke:
548,THE MONEY,"And when, at last, I’d struggled here,"
549,THE MONEY,’Twas long ere I could see things clear...
550,THE MONEY,That he was lying here ... and he
551,THE MONEY,Was dead ... and burning like a tree...
552,THE MONEY,"A tree-trunk soaked in oil ... No doubt,"
553,THE MONEY,"The engine had caught fire, somehow;"
554,THE MONEY,"And when he tried to put it out,"
555,THE MONEY,His greasy clothes had caught ... and now
556,THE MONEY,As fine a lad as you could see...
557,THE MONEY,And such a lad for singing ... I
558,THE MONEY,Had heard him when I worked hard by;
559,THE MONEY,And often quiet I would sit
560,THE MONEY,"To hear him, singing in the pit,"
561,THE MONEY,"As though his heart knew naught of it,"
562,THE MONEY,And life was nothing but a song.
563,THE MONEY,
564,THE MONEY,"""He’d not been working with us long:"
565,THE MONEY,And little of his ways I knew:
566,THE MONEY,"But, when I’d got him up, at last;"
567,THE MONEY,"And he was lying in the shed,"
568,THE MONEY,The sweet song silent in his breast;
569,THE MONEY,And there was nothing more to do:
570,THE MONEY,The notion came into my head
571,THE MONEY,That he had always been well-dressed;
572,THE MONEY,And seemed a neat and thrifty lad...
573,THE MONEY,"And lived in lodgings ... so, maybe,"
574,THE MONEY,Would carry on him all he had.
575,THE MONEY,"So, back into the cage I stepped:"
576,THE MONEY,"And, when it reached the bottom, crept"
577,THE MONEY,Along the gallery again
578,THE MONEY,"And, in the dust where he had lain,"
579,THE MONEY,"I rummaged, until I found all"
580,THE MONEY,That from his burning pockets fell.
581,THE MONEY,"And when it seemed there was no more,"
582,THE MONEY,"I thought how, happy and alive,"
583,THE MONEY,"And recking naught what might befall,"
584,THE MONEY,"He, too, for all that I could tell,"
585,THE MONEY,"Just where I stood, had reckoned o’er"
586,THE MONEY,That four-pound-seventeen-and-five.
587,THE MONEY,
588,THE MONEY,"""Aye, like enough ... for soon we heard"
589,THE MONEY,That in a week he’d looked to wed.
590,THE MONEY,He’d meant to give the girl that night
591,THE MONEY,The money to buy furniture.
592,THE MONEY,"She came, and watched till morning-light"
593,THE MONEY,Beside the body in the shed:
594,THE MONEY,"Then rose: and took, without a word,"
595,THE MONEY,"The money he had left for her."""
596,THE MONEY,
597,THE MONEY,*      *      *      *      *
598,THE MONEY,
599,THE MONEY,"Then, as I wandered through the rain,"
600,THE MONEY,I seemed to stand in awe again
601,THE MONEY,Beside that lonely garret-bed.
602,THE MONEY,And it was good to think the dead
603,THE MONEY,Had known the wealth she would not spend
604,THE MONEY,To keep a little while alive--
605,THE MONEY,His four-pound-seventeen-and-five--
606,THE MONEY,Would buy her houseroom in the end.
607,THE MONEY,
608,THE MONEY,
609,THE MONEY,
610,THE MONEY,
611,THE SNOW,THE SNOW
612,THE SNOW,
613,THE SNOW,"Just as the school came out,"
614,THE SNOW,The first white flakes were drifting round about:
615,THE SNOW,And all the children shouted with delight
616,THE SNOW,"To see such flakes, so big, so white,"
617,THE SNOW,"Tumbling from a cloud so black,"
618,THE SNOW,And whirling helter-skelter
619,THE SNOW,Across the windy moor:
620,THE SNOW,"And as they saw the light flakes race,"
621,THE SNOW,"Started off in headlong chase,"
622,THE SNOW,"Swooping on them with a shout,"
623,THE SNOW,When they seemed to drop for shelter
624,THE SNOW,Underneath the dry-stone wall.
625,THE SNOW,
626,THE SNOW,"And then the master, at the schoolhouse door,"
627,THE SNOW,"Called out to them to hurry home, before"
628,THE SNOW,The storm should come on worse: and watched till all
629,THE SNOW,Had started off by road or moorland track:
630,THE SNOW,"When, turning to his wife, he said:"
631,THE SNOW,It looked like dirty weather overhead:
632,THE SNOW,"He thought ’twould be a heavy fall,"
633,THE SNOW,And threatened for a roughish night;
634,THE SNOW,But they would all reach home in broad daylight.
635,THE SNOW,"’Twas early, yet; he’d let the school out soon;"
636,THE SNOW,As it had looked so lowering since forenoon;
637,THE SNOW,And many had a goodish step to go:
638,THE SNOW,And it was but ill-travelling in the snow.
639,THE SNOW,Then by the fire he settled down to read;
640,THE SNOW,And to the weather paid no further heed.
641,THE SNOW,
642,THE SNOW,"And, on their road home, full three miles away,"
643,THE SNOW,"John, and his little sister, Janey, started;"
644,THE SNOW,"And, at the setting out, were happy-hearted"
645,THE SNOW,"To be let loose into a world so gay,"
646,THE SNOW,With jolly winds and frisking flakes at play
647,THE SNOW,"That flicked your cheek, and whistled in your teeth:"
648,THE SNOW,And now hard on each other’s heels they darted
649,THE SNOW,"To catch a flake that floated like a feather,"
650,THE SNOW,Then dropt to nestle in a clump of heather;
651,THE SNOW,And often tumbled both together
652,THE SNOW,Into a deep delicious bed
653,THE SNOW,Of brown and springy heath.
654,THE SNOW,"But, when the sky grew blacker overhead,"
655,THE SNOW,"As if it were the coming on of night,"
656,THE SNOW,"And every little hill, well-known to sight,"
657,THE SNOW,Looked big and strange in its new fleece of white;
658,THE SNOW,And as yet faster and more thickly
659,THE SNOW,"The big flakes fell,"
660,THE SNOW,To John the thought came that it might be well
661,THE SNOW,"To hurry home; so, striding on before,"
662,THE SNOW,He set a steady face across the moor;
663,THE SNOW,And called to Janey she must come more quickly.
664,THE SNOW,
665,THE SNOW,The wind soon dropped: and fine and dry the snow
666,THE SNOW,"Came whispering down about them, as they trudged"
667,THE SNOW,"And, when they’d travelled for a mile or so,"
668,THE SNOW,They found it ankle-deep: for here the storm
669,THE SNOW,Had started long before it reached the school:
670,THE SNOW,"And, as he felt the dry flakes tingling warm"
671,THE SNOW,"Upon his cheek, and set him all aglow,"
672,THE SNOW,"John in his manly pride, a little grudged"
673,THE SNOW,That now and then he had to wait awhile
674,THE SNOW,"For Janey, lagging like a little fool:"
675,THE SNOW,"But, when they’d covered near another mile"
676,THE SNOW,"Through that bewildering white without a sound,"
677,THE SNOW,"Save rustling, rustling, rustling all around;"
678,THE SNOW,"And all his well-known world, so queer and dim,"
679,THE SNOW,He waited until she caught up to him;
680,THE SNOW,And felt quite glad that he was not alone.
681,THE SNOW,
682,THE SNOW,"And when they reached the low, half-buried stone"
683,THE SNOW,"That marked where some old shepherd had been found,"
684,THE SNOW,"Lost in the snow in seeking his lost sheep,"
685,THE SNOW,"One wild March night, full forty years ago,"
686,THE SNOW,"He wished, and wished, that they were safe and sound"
687,THE SNOW,"In their own house: and as the snow got deeper,"
688,THE SNOW,"And every little bank seemed strangely steeper,"
689,THE SNOW,"He thought, and thought of that lost sleeper;"
690,THE SNOW,"And saw him lying in the snow,"
691,THE SNOW,Till every fleecy clump of heath
692,THE SNOW,Seemed to shroud a man beneath;
693,THE SNOW,And now his blood went hot and cold
694,THE SNOW,Through very fear of that dread sight;
695,THE SNOW,"And then he felt that, in sheer fright,"
696,THE SNOW,"He must take to his heels in flight,"
697,THE SNOW,"He cared not whither, so that it might be"
698,THE SNOW,"Where there were no more bundles, cold and white,"
699,THE SNOW,"Like sheeted bodies, plain to see."
700,THE SNOW,"And, all on edge, he turned to chide"
701,THE SNOW,"His sister, dragging at his side:"
702,THE SNOW,"But, when he found that she was crying,"
703,THE SNOW,"Because her feet and hands were cold,"
704,THE SNOW,He quite forgot to scold:
705,THE SNOW,And spoke kind words of cheer to her:
706,THE SNOW,And saw no more dead shepherds lying
707,THE SNOW,In any snowy clump of heather.
708,THE SNOW,"So, hand in hand, they trudged together,"
709,THE SNOW,"Through that strange world of drifting gloam,"
710,THE SNOW,Sharp-set and longing sore for home.
711,THE SNOW,
712,THE SNOW,"And John remembered how that morning,"
713,THE SNOW,When they set out the sky was blue--
714,THE SNOW,"Clean, cloudless blue; and gave no warning;"
715,THE SNOW,"And how through air as clear as glass,"
716,THE SNOW,The far-off hills he knew
717,THE SNOW,Looked strangely near; and glittered brightly;
718,THE SNOW,Each sprig of heath and blade of grass
719,THE SNOW,"In the cold wind blowing lightly,"
720,THE SNOW,Each clump of green and crimson moss
721,THE SNOW,Sparkling in the wintry sun.
722,THE SNOW,
723,THE SNOW,"But now, as they toiled home, across"
724,THE SNOW,"These unfamiliar fells, nigh done,"
725,THE SNOW,The wind again began to blow;
726,THE SNOW,"And thicker, thicker fell the snow:"
727,THE SNOW,"Till Janey sank, too numb to stir:"
728,THE SNOW,"When John stooped down, and lifted her,"
729,THE SNOW,To carry her upon his back.
730,THE SNOW,And then his head began to tire:
731,THE SNOW,And soon he seemed to lose the track...
732,THE SNOW,And now the world was all afire...
733,THE SNOW,"Now dazzling white, now dazzling black..."
734,THE SNOW,"And then, through some strange land of light,"
735,THE SNOW,"Where clouds of butterflies all white,"
736,THE SNOW,"Fluttered and flickered all about,"
737,THE SNOW,"Dancing ever in and out,"
738,THE SNOW,"He wandered, blinded by white wings,"
739,THE SNOW,"That rustled, rustled in his ears"
740,THE SNOW,"With cold, uncanny whisperings..."
741,THE SNOW,And then it seemed his bones must crack
742,THE SNOW,With that dead weight upon his back...
743,THE SNOW,"When, on his cheek, he felt warm tears,"
744,THE SNOW,And a cold tangle of wet hair;
745,THE SNOW,And knew ’twas Janey weeping there:
746,THE SNOW,"And, taking heart, he stumbled on,"
747,THE SNOW,While in his breast the hearthlight shone:
748,THE SNOW,And it was all of his desire
749,THE SNOW,To sit once more before the fire;
750,THE SNOW,And feel the friendly glowing heat.
751,THE SNOW,"But, as he strove with fumbling feet,"
752,THE SNOW,It seemed that he would never find
753,THE SNOW,Again that cheery hearth and kind;
754,THE SNOW,"But wander ever, bent and blind,"
755,THE SNOW,Beneath his burden through the night
756,THE SNOW,"Of dreadful, spangly, whispering white."
757,THE SNOW,
758,THE SNOW,The wind rose; and the dry snow drifted
759,THE SNOW,In little eddies round the track:
760,THE SNOW,"And when, at last, the dark cloud rifted,"
761,THE SNOW,"He saw a strange lough, lying cold and black,"
762,THE SNOW,"’Mid unknown, ghostly hills; and knew"
763,THE SNOW,"That they were lost: and once again,"
764,THE SNOW,The snow closed in: and swept from view
765,THE SNOW,The dead black water and strange fells.
766,THE SNOW,
767,THE SNOW,"But still he struggled on: and then,"
768,THE SNOW,When he seemed climbing up an endless steep
769,THE SNOW,"And ever slipping, sliding back,"
770,THE SNOW,"With ankles aching like to crack,"
771,THE SNOW,And only longed for sleep;
772,THE SNOW,"He heard a tinkling sound of bells,"
773,THE SNOW,"That kept on ringing, ringing, ringing,"
774,THE SNOW,Until his dizzy head was singing;
775,THE SNOW,And he could think of nothing else:
776,THE SNOW,And then it seemed the weight was lifted
777,THE SNOW,From off his back; and on the ground
778,THE SNOW,"His sister stood, while, all around"
779,THE SNOW,"Were giants clad in coats of wool,"
780,THE SNOW,"With big, curled horns, and queer black faces,"
781,THE SNOW,"Who bobbed and curtsied in their places,"
782,THE SNOW,With blazing eyes and strange grimaces;
783,THE SNOW,But never made a sound;
784,THE SNOW,"Then nearly shook themselves to pieces,"
785,THE SNOW,"Shedding round a smell of warm, wet fleeces:"
786,THE SNOW,"Then one it seemed as if he knew,"
787,THE SNOW,"Looking like the old lame ewe,"
788,THE SNOW,"Began to bite his coat, and pull"
789,THE SNOW,Till he could hardly stand: its eyes
790,THE SNOW,"Glowing to a monstrous size,"
791,THE SNOW,Till they were like a lantern light
792,THE SNOW,Burning brightly through the night...
793,THE SNOW,"When someone stooped from out the sky,"
794,THE SNOW,To rescue him; and set him high:
795,THE SNOW,"And he was riding, snug and warm,"
796,THE SNOW,"In some king’s chariot through the storm,"
797,THE SNOW,Without a sound of wheel or hoof--
798,THE SNOW,"In some king’s chariot, filled with straw,"
799,THE SNOW,And he would nevermore be cold...
800,THE SNOW,
801,THE SNOW,And then with wondering eyes he saw
802,THE SNOW,Deep caverns of pure burning gold;
803,THE SNOW,And knew himself in fairyland:
804,THE SNOW,But when he stretched an eager hand
805,THE SNOW,"To touch the glowing walls, he felt"
806,THE SNOW,"A queer warm puff, as though of fire..."
807,THE SNOW,And suddenly he smelt
808,THE SNOW,"The reek of peat; and looking higher,"
809,THE SNOW,"He saw the old, black porridge-kettle,"
810,THE SNOW,"Hanging from the cavern roof,"
811,THE SNOW,Hanging on its own black crook:
812,THE SNOW,"And he was lying on the settle,"
813,THE SNOW,"While by his side,"
814,THE SNOW,"With tender look,"
815,THE SNOW,His mother knelt;
816,THE SNOW,And he had only one desire
817,THE SNOW,In all the world; and ’twas to fling
818,THE SNOW,"His arms about her neck, and hide"
819,THE SNOW,His happy tears upon her breast.
820,THE SNOW,"And as to her he closely pressed,"
821,THE SNOW,He heard his merry father sing:
822,THE SNOW,"""There was a silly sleepyhead,"
823,THE SNOW,Who thought he’d like to go to bed:
824,THE SNOW,"So in a stell he went to sleep,"
825,THE SNOW,"And snored among the other sheep."""
826,THE SNOW,
827,THE SNOW,And then his mother gently said:
828,THE SNOW,"""Nay, father: do not tease him now:"
829,THE SNOW,He’s quite worn out: and needs a deal
830,THE SNOW,"Of quiet sleep: and, after all,"
831,THE SNOW,"He brought his sister safe from school."""
832,THE SNOW,And now he felt her warm tears fall
833,THE SNOW,Upon his cheek: and thrilled to feel
834,THE SNOW,"His father’s hand on his hot brow,"
835,THE SNOW,"And hear him say: ""The lad’s no fool."""
836,THE SNOW,
837,THE SNOW,
838,THE SNOW,
839,THE SNOW,
840,RED FOX,RED FOX
841,RED FOX,
842,RED FOX,I hated him ... his beard was red...
843,RED FOX,"Red fox, red thief! ... Ah, God, that she--"
844,RED FOX,She with the proud and lifted head
845,RED FOX,That never stooped to glance at me--
846,RED FOX,"So fair and fancy-free, should wed"
847,RED FOX,A slinking dog-fox such as he!
848,RED FOX,
849,RED FOX,Was it last night I hated him?
850,RED FOX,Last night?  It seems an age ago...
851,RED FOX,"At whiles, my mind comes over dim"
852,RED FOX,"As if God’s breath ... yet, ever slow"
853,RED FOX,"And dull, too dull she ... limb from limb"
854,RED FOX,"Last night I could have torn him, so!"
855,RED FOX,
856,RED FOX,My lonely bed was fire and ice.
857,RED FOX,I could not sleep.  I could not lie.
858,RED FOX,I shut my hot eyes once or twice...
859,RED FOX,And saw a red fox slinking by...
860,RED FOX,A red dog-fox that turned back thrice
861,RED FOX,To mock me with a merry eye.
862,RED FOX,
863,RED FOX,And so I rose to pace the floor...
864,RED FOX,"And, ere I knew, my clothes were on..."
865,RED FOX,"And as I stood outside the door,"
866,RED FOX,Cold in the Summer moonlight shone
867,RED FOX,The gleaming barrel ... and no more
868,RED FOX,"I feared the fox, for fear was one."
869,RED FOX,
870,RED FOX,"""The best of friends,"" I said, ""must part..."""
871,RED FOX,"""The best of friends must part,"" I said:"
872,RED FOX,And like the creaking of a cart
873,RED FOX,The words went wheeling through my head.
874,RED FOX,"""The best of friends..."" and, in my heart,"
875,RED FOX,"Red fox, already lying dead!"
876,RED FOX,
877,RED FOX,I took the trackway through the wood.
878,RED FOX,"Red fox had sought a woodland den,"
879,RED FOX,"When she ... when she ... but, ’twas not good"
880,RED FOX,To think too much on her just then...
881,RED FOX,"The woman must beware, who stood"
882,RED FOX,Between two stark and fearless men.
883,RED FOX,
884,RED FOX,The pathway took a sudden turn...
885,RED FOX,And in a trice my steps were stayed.
886,RED FOX,"Before me, in the moonlit fern,"
887,RED FOX,A young dog-fox and vixen played
888,RED FOX,With their red cubs beside the burn...
889,RED FOX,And I stood trembling and afraid.
890,RED FOX,
891,RED FOX,They frolicked in the warm moonlight--
892,RED FOX,A scuffling heap of heads and heels...
893,RED FOX,A rascal rush ... a playful bite...
894,RED FOX,"A scuttling brush, and frightened squeals..."
895,RED FOX,A flash of teeth ... a show of fight...
896,RED FOX,Then lively as a bunch of eels
897,RED FOX,
898,RED FOX,"Once more they gambolled in the brake,"
899,RED FOX,"And tumbled headlong in the stream,"
900,RED FOX,Then scrambled gasping out to shake
901,RED FOX,"Their sleek, wet, furry coats agleam."
902,RED FOX,"I watched them, fearful and awake..."
903,RED FOX,"I watched them, hateless and adream."
904,RED FOX,
905,RED FOX,"The dog-fox gave a bark, and then"
906,RED FOX,"All ran to him: and, full of pride,"
907,RED FOX,"He took the trackway up the glen,"
908,RED FOX,His family trotting by his side:
909,RED FOX,"The young cubs nosing for the den,"
910,RED FOX,"With trailing brushes, sleepy-eyed."
911,RED FOX,
912,RED FOX,And then it seems I must have slept--
913,RED FOX,Dropt dead asleep ... dropt dead outworn.
914,RED FOX,"I wakened, as the first gleam crept"
915,RED FOX,"Among the fern, and it was morn..."
916,RED FOX,God’s eye about their home had kept
917,RED FOX,"Good watch, the night her son was born."
918,RED FOX,
919,RED FOX,
920,RED FOX,
921,RED FOX,
922,THE OVENS,THE OVENS
923,THE OVENS,
924,THE OVENS,He trailed along the cinder-track
925,THE OVENS,"Beside the sleek canal, whose black"
926,THE OVENS,"Cold, slinking waters shivered back"
927,THE OVENS,Each frosty spark of starry light;
928,THE OVENS,"And each star pricked, an icy pin,"
929,THE OVENS,Through his old jacket worn and thin:
930,THE OVENS,The raw wind rasped his shrinking skin
931,THE OVENS,As if stark naked to its bite;
932,THE OVENS,"Yet, cutting through him like a knife,"
933,THE OVENS,It would not cut the thread of life;
934,THE OVENS,But only turned his feet to stones
935,THE OVENS,"With red-hot soles, that weighed like lead"
936,THE OVENS,"In his old broken boots.  His head,"
937,THE OVENS,"Sunk low upon his sunken chest,"
938,THE OVENS,"Was but a burning, icy ache"
939,THE OVENS,That strained a skull which would not break
940,THE OVENS,To let him tumble down to rest.
941,THE OVENS,He felt the cold stars in his bones:
942,THE OVENS,"And only wished that he were dead,"
943,THE OVENS,With no curst searching wind to shred
944,THE OVENS,The very flesh from off his bones--
945,THE OVENS,"No wind to whistle through his bones,"
946,THE OVENS,"His naked, icy, burning bones:"
947,THE OVENS,"When, looking up, he saw, ahead,"
948,THE OVENS,The far coke-ovens’ glowing light
949,THE OVENS,That burnt a red hole in the night.
950,THE OVENS,And but to snooze beside that fire
951,THE OVENS,Was all the heaven of his desire...
952,THE OVENS,To tread no more this cursed track
953,THE OVENS,"Of crunching cinders, through a black"
954,THE OVENS,"And blasted world of cinder-heaps,"
955,THE OVENS,Beside a sleek canal that creeps
956,THE OVENS,"Like crawling ice through every bone,"
957,THE OVENS,"Beneath the cruel stars, alone"
958,THE OVENS,With this hell-raking wind that sets
959,THE OVENS,The cold teeth rattling castanets...
960,THE OVENS,"Yea, heaven, indeed, that core of red"
961,THE OVENS,In night’s black heart that seemed quite dead.
962,THE OVENS,"Though still far off, the crimson glow"
963,THE OVENS,"Through his chilled veins began to flow,"
964,THE OVENS,And fill his shrivelled heart with heat;
965,THE OVENS,"And, as he dragged his senseless feet,"
966,THE OVENS,That lagged as though to hold him back
967,THE OVENS,"In cold, eternal hell of black,"
968,THE OVENS,"With heaven before him, blazing red,"
969,THE OVENS,The set eyes staring in his head
970,THE OVENS,Were held by spell of fire quite blind
971,THE OVENS,"To that black world that fell behind,"
972,THE OVENS,A cindery wilderness of death;
973,THE OVENS,"As he drew slowly near and nearer,"
974,THE OVENS,And saw the ovens glowing clearer--
975,THE OVENS,Low-domed and humming hives of heat--
976,THE OVENS,And felt the blast of burning breath
977,THE OVENS,That quivered from each white-hot brick:
978,THE OVENS,"Till, blinded by the blaze, and sick"
979,THE OVENS,He dropped into a welcome seat
980,THE OVENS,"Of warm white ashes, sinking low"
981,THE OVENS,To soak his body in the glow
982,THE OVENS,"That shot him through with prickling pain,"
983,THE OVENS,"An eager agony of fire,"
984,THE OVENS,"Delicious after the cold ache,"
985,THE OVENS,"And scorched his tingling, frosted skin."
986,THE OVENS,Then gradually the anguish passed;
987,THE OVENS,"And blissfully he lay, at last,"
988,THE OVENS,"Without an unfulfilled desire,"
989,THE OVENS,His grateful body drinking in
990,THE OVENS,"Warm, blessed, snug forgetfulness."
991,THE OVENS,"And yet, with staring eyes awake,"
992,THE OVENS,As though no drench of heat could slake
993,THE OVENS,"His thirst for fire, he watched a red"
994,THE OVENS,Hot eye that burned within a chink
995,THE OVENS,Between the bricks: while overhead
996,THE OVENS,"The quivering stream of hot, gold air"
997,THE OVENS,Surged up to quench the cold starlight.
998,THE OVENS,"His brain, too numbed and dull to think"
999,THE OVENS,"Throughout the day, in that fierce glare"
1000,THE OVENS,"Awoke, at last, with startled stare"
1001,THE OVENS,"Of pitiless, insistent sight"
1002,THE OVENS,"That stript the stark, mean, bitter strife"
1003,THE OVENS,"Of his poor, broken, wasted life,"
1004,THE OVENS,"Crippled from birth, and struggling on,"
1005,THE OVENS,"The last, least shred of hope long gone,"
1006,THE OVENS,"To some unknown, black, bitter end."
1007,THE OVENS,"But, even as he looked, his brain"
1008,THE OVENS,Sank back to sightless sloth again;
1009,THE OVENS,"Then, all at once, he seemed to choke;"
1010,THE OVENS,And knew it was the stealthy stife
1011,THE OVENS,And deadly fume of burning coke
1012,THE OVENS,"That filled his lungs, and seemed to soak"
1013,THE OVENS,"Through every pore, until the blood"
1014,THE OVENS,"Grew thick and heavy in his veins,"
1015,THE OVENS,And he could scarcely draw a breath.
1016,THE OVENS,"He lay, and murmured drowsily,"
1017,THE OVENS,"With closing eyes: ""If this be death,"
1018,THE OVENS,It’s snug and easy ... let it come...
1019,THE OVENS,For life is cold and hard ... the flood
1020,THE OVENS,Is rising with the heavy rains
1021,THE OVENS,"That pour and pour ... that damned old drum,"
1022,THE OVENS,Why ever can’t they let it be...
1023,THE OVENS,"Beat-beating, beating, beating, beat..."""
1024,THE OVENS,"Then, suddenly, he sat upright,"
1025,THE OVENS,"For, close behind him in the night,"
1026,THE OVENS,"He heard a breathing loud and deep,"
1027,THE OVENS,And caught a whiff of burning leather.
1028,THE OVENS,"He shook himself alive, and turned;"
1029,THE OVENS,"And on a heap of ashes white,"
1030,THE OVENS,"O’ercome by the full blast of heat,"
1031,THE OVENS,"Where fieriest the dread blaze burned,"
1032,THE OVENS,He saw a young girl stretched in sleep.
1033,THE OVENS,He sat awhile with heavy gaze
1034,THE OVENS,"Fixed on her in a dull amaze,"
1035,THE OVENS,Until he saw her scorched boots smoking:
1036,THE OVENS,"Then, whispering huskily: ""She’s dying,"
1037,THE OVENS,"While I look on and watch her choking!"""
1038,THE OVENS,He roused: and pulled himself together:
1039,THE OVENS,"And rose, and went where she was lying:"
1040,THE OVENS,"And, bending o’er the senseless lass,"
1041,THE OVENS,In his weak arms he lifted her;
1042,THE OVENS,"And bore her out beyond the glare,"
1043,THE OVENS,"Beyond the stealthy, stifling gas,"
1044,THE OVENS,Into the fresh and eager air:
1045,THE OVENS,And laid her gently on the ground
1046,THE OVENS,Beneath the cold and starry sky:
1047,THE OVENS,And did his best to bring her round;
1048,THE OVENS,"Though still, for all that he could try,"
1049,THE OVENS,"She seemed, with each deep-labouring breath"
1050,THE OVENS,Just brought up on the brink of death.
1051,THE OVENS,"He sought, and found an icy pool,"
1052,THE OVENS,"Though he had but a cap to fill,"
1053,THE OVENS,"And bathed her hands and face, until"
1054,THE OVENS,"The troubled breath was quieter,"
1055,THE OVENS,And her flushed forehead felt quite cool:
1056,THE OVENS,And then he saw an eyelid stir;
1057,THE OVENS,"And shivering she sat up at last,"
1058,THE OVENS,And looked about her sullenly.
1059,THE OVENS,"""I’m cold ... I’m mortal cold,"" she said:"
1060,THE OVENS,"""What call had you to waken me?"
1061,THE OVENS,"I was so warm and happy, dead..."
1062,THE OVENS,"And still those staring stars!""  Her head"
1063,THE OVENS,Dropt in her hands: and thick and fast
1064,THE OVENS,The tears came with a heavy sobbing.
1065,THE OVENS,He stood quite helpless while she cried;
1066,THE OVENS,And watched her shaken bosom throbbing
1067,THE OVENS,"With passionate, wild, weak distress,"
1068,THE OVENS,Till it was spent.  And then she dried
1069,THE OVENS,Her eyes upon her singed black dress;
1070,THE OVENS,"Looked up, and saw him standing there,"
1071,THE OVENS,"Wondering, and more than half-afraid."
1072,THE OVENS,"But now, the nipping, hungry air"
1073,THE OVENS,"Took hold of her, and struck fear dead."
1074,THE OVENS,She only felt the starving sting
1075,THE OVENS,"That must, at any price, be stayed;"
1076,THE OVENS,"And cried out: ""I am famishing!"""
1077,THE OVENS,Then from his pocket he took bread
1078,THE OVENS,That he had been too weak and sick
1079,THE OVENS,"To eat o’ernight: and eager-eyed,"
1080,THE OVENS,She took it timidly; and said:
1081,THE OVENS,"""I have not tasted food two days."""
1082,THE OVENS,"And, as he waited by her side,"
1083,THE OVENS,He watched her with a quiet gaze;
1084,THE OVENS,And saw her munch the broken crust
1085,THE OVENS,"So gladly, seated in the dust"
1086,THE OVENS,"Of that black desert’s bitter night,"
1087,THE OVENS,"Beneath the freezing stars, so white"
1088,THE OVENS,And hunger-pinched: and at the sight
1089,THE OVENS,Keen pity touched him to the quick;
1090,THE OVENS,"Although he never said a word,"
1091,THE OVENS,Till she had finished every crumb.
1092,THE OVENS,And then he led her to a seat
1093,THE OVENS,"A little closer to the heat,"
1094,THE OVENS,But well beyond the deadly stife.
1095,THE OVENS,"And in the ashes, side by side,"
1096,THE OVENS,"They sat together, dazed and dumb,"
1097,THE OVENS,"With eyes upon the ovens’ glare,"
1098,THE OVENS,Each looking nakedly on life.
1099,THE OVENS,"And then, at length, she sighed, and stirred,"
1100,THE OVENS,Still staring deep and dreamy-eyed
1101,THE OVENS,"Into the whitening, steady glow."
1102,THE OVENS,"With jerky, broken words and slow,"
1103,THE OVENS,"And biting at her finger-ends,"
1104,THE OVENS,She talked at last: and spoke out all
1105,THE OVENS,"Quite open-heartedly, as though"
1106,THE OVENS,There were not any stranger there--
1107,THE OVENS,"The fire and he, both bosom-friends."
1108,THE OVENS,She’d left her home three months ago--
1109,THE OVENS,"She, country-born and country-bred,"
1110,THE OVENS,Had got the notion in her head
1111,THE OVENS,That she’d like city-service best...
1112,THE OVENS,And so no country place could please...
1113,THE OVENS,And she had worried without rest
1114,THE OVENS,"Until, at last, she got her ends;"
1115,THE OVENS,"And, wiser than her folk and friends,"
1116,THE OVENS,She left her home among the trees...
1117,THE OVENS,The trees grew thick for miles about
1118,THE OVENS,Her father’s house ... the forest spread
1119,THE OVENS,As far as ever you could see...
1120,THE OVENS,"And it was green, in Summer, green..."
1121,THE OVENS,"Since she had left her home, she’d seen"
1122,THE OVENS,No greenness could compare with it...
1123,THE OVENS,"And everything was fresh and clean,"
1124,THE OVENS,And not all smutched and smirched with smoke
1125,THE OVENS,"They burned no sooty coal and coke,"
1126,THE OVENS,"But only wood-logs, ash and oak..."
1127,THE OVENS,And by the fire at night they’d sit...
1128,THE OVENS,Ah! wouldn’t it be rare and good
1129,THE OVENS,"To smell the sappy, sizzling wood,"
1130,THE OVENS,Once more; and listen to the stream
1131,THE OVENS,That runs just by the garden-gate...
1132,THE OVENS,"And often, in a Winter spate,"
1133,THE OVENS,"She’d wakened from a troubled dream,"
1134,THE OVENS,"And lain in bed, and heard it roar;"
1135,THE OVENS,"And quaked to hear it, as a child..."
1136,THE OVENS,"It seemed so angry, and so wild--"
1137,THE OVENS,Just mad to sweep the house away!
1138,THE OVENS,"And now, it was three months or more"
1139,THE OVENS,"Since she had heard it, on the day..."
1140,THE OVENS,The day she left ... and Michael stood...
1141,THE OVENS,"He was a woodman, too, and he"
1142,THE OVENS,Worked with her father in the wood...
1143,THE OVENS,"And wanted her, she knew ... but she"
1144,THE OVENS,"Was proud, and thought herself too good"
1145,THE OVENS,To marry any country lad...
1146,THE OVENS,’Twas queer to think she’d once been proud--
1147,THE OVENS,And such a little while ago--
1148,THE OVENS,"A beggar, wolfing crusts! ... The pride"
1149,THE OVENS,That made her quit her countryside
1150,THE OVENS,Soon left her stranded in the crowd...
1151,THE OVENS,And precious little pride she had
1152,THE OVENS,To keep her warm these freezing days
1153,THE OVENS,Since she had fled the city-ways
1154,THE OVENS,To walk back home ... aye! home again:
1155,THE OVENS,"For, in the town, she’d tried in vain,"
1156,THE OVENS,For honest work to earn her bread...
1157,THE OVENS,"At one place, they’d nigh slaved her dead,"
1158,THE OVENS,"And starved her, too; and, when she left,"
1159,THE OVENS,Had cheated her of half her wage:
1160,THE OVENS,But she’d no means to stop the theft...
1161,THE OVENS,And she’d had no more work to do...
1162,THE OVENS,"Two months since, now ... it seemed an age!"
1163,THE OVENS,"How she had lived, she scarcely knew..."
1164,THE OVENS,"And still, poor fool, too proud to write"
1165,THE OVENS,"To home for help, until, at length,"
1166,THE OVENS,"She’d not a penny for a bite,"
1167,THE OVENS,Or pride enough to clothe her back...
1168,THE OVENS,"So, she was tramping home, too poor"
1169,THE OVENS,"To pay the train-fare ... she’d the strength,"
1170,THE OVENS,"If she’d the food ... but that hard track,"
1171,THE OVENS,"And that cold, cruel, bitter night"
1172,THE OVENS,Had taken all the heart from her...
1173,THE OVENS,"If Michael knew, she felt quite sure..."
1174,THE OVENS,For she would rather drop stone-dead
1175,THE OVENS,Than live as some ... if she had cared
1176,THE OVENS,"To feed upon the devil’s bread,"
1177,THE OVENS,She could have earned it easily...
1178,THE OVENS,"She’d pride enough to starve instead,"
1179,THE OVENS,"Aye, starve, than fare as some girls fared..."
1180,THE OVENS,"But, that was all behind ... and she"
1181,THE OVENS,"Was going home ... and yet, maybe,"
1182,THE OVENS,"If they’d a home like hers, they, too,"
1183,THE OVENS,Would be too proud ... she only knew
1184,THE OVENS,"The thought of home had kept her straight,"
1185,THE OVENS,And saved her ere it was too late.
1186,THE OVENS,She’d soon be home again...
1187,THE OVENS,And now
1188,THE OVENS,She sat with hand upon her brow;
1189,THE OVENS,And did not speak again nor stir.
1190,THE OVENS,
1191,THE OVENS,"And, as he heard her words, his gaze"
1192,THE OVENS,"Still set upon the steady glare,"
1193,THE OVENS,His thoughts turned back to city-ways:
1194,THE OVENS,And he remembered common sights
1195,THE OVENS,That he had seen in city nights:
1196,THE OVENS,"And, once again, in early June,"
1197,THE OVENS,He wandered through the midnight street;
1198,THE OVENS,And heard those ever-pacing feet
1199,THE OVENS,"Of young girls, children yet in years,"
1200,THE OVENS,"With gaudy ribbons in their hair,"
1201,THE OVENS,"And shameless fevered eyes astare,"
1202,THE OVENS,"And slack lips set in brazen leers,"
1203,THE OVENS,"Who walked the pavements of despair,"
1204,THE OVENS,Beneath the fair full Summer moon...
1205,THE OVENS,"Shadowed by worn-out, wizened hags,"
1206,THE OVENS,With claw-hands clutching filthy rags
1207,THE OVENS,"About old bosoms, shrunk and thin,"
1208,THE OVENS,"And mouths aleer without a tooth,"
1209,THE OVENS,"Who dogged them, cursing their sleek youth"
1210,THE OVENS,That filched their custom and their bread...
1211,THE OVENS,"Then, in a reek of hot gas light,"
1212,THE OVENS,"He stood where, through the Summer night,"
1213,THE OVENS,"Half-dozing in the stifling air,"
1214,THE OVENS,"The greasy landlord, fat with sin,"
1215,THE OVENS,"Sat, lolling in his easy chair,"
1216,THE OVENS,"Just half-way up the brothel stair,"
1217,THE OVENS,"To tax the earnings they brought in,"
1218,THE OVENS,And hearken for the policeman’s tread...
1219,THE OVENS,
1220,THE OVENS,"Then, shuddering back from that foul place"
1221,THE OVENS,"And turning from the ovens’ glare,"
1222,THE OVENS,He looked into her dreaming face;
1223,THE OVENS,"And saw green, sunlit woodlands there,"
1224,THE OVENS,And waters flashing in between
1225,THE OVENS,Low-drooping boughs of Summer green.
1226,THE OVENS,
1227,THE OVENS,"And as he looked, still in a dream"
1228,THE OVENS,"She murmured: ""Michael would, she knew..."
1229,THE OVENS,"Though she’d been foolish ... he was true,"
1230,THE OVENS,"As true as steel, and fond of her..."
1231,THE OVENS,And then she sat with eyes agleam
1232,THE OVENS,"In dreaming silence, till the stir"
1233,THE OVENS,Of cold dawn shivered through the air:
1234,THE OVENS,"When, twisting up her tumbled hair,"
1235,THE OVENS,"She rose; and said, she must be gone."
1236,THE OVENS,"Though she’d still far to go, the day"
1237,THE OVENS,Would see her well upon her way...
1238,THE OVENS,"And she had best be jogging on,"
1239,THE OVENS,"While she’d the strength ... and so, ""Good-bye."""
1240,THE OVENS,
1241,THE OVENS,"And as, beneath the paling sky,"
1242,THE OVENS,He trudged again the cinder-track
1243,THE OVENS,"That stretched before him, dead and black,"
1244,THE OVENS,"He muttered: ""It’s a chance the light"
1245,THE OVENS,Has found me living still ... and she--
1246,THE OVENS,"She, too ... and Michael ... and through me"
1247,THE OVENS,"God knows whom I may wake to-night."""
