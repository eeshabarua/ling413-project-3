861,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP
862,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,
863,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,
864,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,THE Snowdrop is the prophet of the flowers;
865,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,It lives and dies upon its bed of snows;
866,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"And like a thought of spring it comes and goes,"
867,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Hanging its head beside our leafless bowers.
868,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"The sun’s betrothing kiss it never knows,"
869,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Nor all the glowing joy of golden showers;
870,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"But ever in a placid, pure repose,"
871,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"More like a spirit with its look serene,"
872,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Droops its pale cheek veined thro’ with infant green.
873,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,
874,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Queen of her sisters is the sweet Wild Rose,"
875,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Sprung from the earnest sun and ripe young June;
876,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,The year’s own darling and the Summer’s Queen!
877,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Lustrous as the new-throned crescent moon.
878,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Much of that early prophet look she shows,"
879,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Mixed with her fair espoused blush which glows,"
880,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,As if the ethereal fairy blood were seen;
881,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Like a soft evening over sunset snows,"
882,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Half twilight violet shade, half crimson sheen."
883,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,
884,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Twin-born are both in beauteousness, most fair"
885,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,In all that glads the eye and charms the air;
886,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,In all that wakes emotions in the mind
887,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,And sows sweet sympathies for human kind.
888,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Twin-born, albeit their seasons are apart,"
889,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,They bloom together in the thoughtful heart;
890,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Fair symbols of the marvels of our state,"
891,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Mute speakers of the oracles of fate!
892,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,
893,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"For each, fulfilling nature’s law, fulfils"
894,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Itself and its own aspirations pure;
895,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Living and dying; letting faith ensure
896,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,New life when deathless Spring shall touch the hills.
897,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Each perfect in its place; and each content
898,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,With that perfection which its being meant:
899,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Divided not by months that intervene,"
900,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,But linked by all the flowers that bud between.
901,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Forever smiling thro’ its season brief,"
902,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,The one in glory and the one in grief:
903,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Forever painting to our museful sight,"
904,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,How lowlihead and loveliness unite.
905,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,
906,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Born from the first blind yearning of the earth
907,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"To be a mother and give happy birth,"
908,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Ere yet the northern sun such rapture brings,"
909,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Lo, from her virgin breast the Snowdrop springs;"
910,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"And ere the snows have melted from the grass,"
911,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"And not a strip of greensward doth appear,"
912,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Save the faint prophecy its cheeks declare,"
913,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Alone, unkissed, unloved, behold it pass!"
914,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"While in the ripe enthronement of the year,"
915,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Whispering the breeze, and wedding the rich air"
916,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"With her so sweet, delicious bridal breath,—"
917,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Odorous and exquisite beyond compare,"
918,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"And starr’d with dews upon her forehead clear,"
919,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Fresh-hearted as a Maiden Queen should be
920,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"Who takes the land’s devotion as her fee,—"
921,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,"The Wild Rose blooms, all summer for her dower,"
922,THE WILD ROSE AND THE SNOWDROP,Nature’s most beautiful and perfect flower.

929,THE DEATH OF WINTER,
930,THE DEATH OF WINTER,WHEN April with her wild blue eye
931,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"Comes dancing over the grass,"
932,THE DEATH OF WINTER,And all the crimson buds so shy
933,THE DEATH OF WINTER,Peep out to see her pass;
934,THE DEATH OF WINTER,As lightly she loosens her showery locks
935,THE DEATH OF WINTER,And flutters her rainy wings;
936,THE DEATH OF WINTER,Laughingly stoops
937,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"To the glass of the stream,"
938,THE DEATH OF WINTER,And loosens and loops
939,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"Her hair by the gleam,"
940,THE DEATH OF WINTER,While all the young villagers blithe as the flocks
941,THE DEATH OF WINTER,Go frolicking round in rings;—
942,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"Then Winter, he who tamed the fly,"
943,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"Turns on his back and prepares to die,"
944,THE DEATH OF WINTER,For he cannot live longer under the sky.
945,THE DEATH OF WINTER,
946,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"Down the valleys glittering green,"
947,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"Down from the hills in snowy rills,"
948,THE DEATH OF WINTER,He melts between the border sheen
949,THE DEATH OF WINTER,And leaps the flowery verges!
950,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"He cannot choose but brighten their hues,"
951,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"And tho’ he would creep, he fain must leap,"
952,THE DEATH OF WINTER,For the quick Spring spirit urges.
953,THE DEATH OF WINTER,Down the vale and down the dale
954,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"He leaps and lights, till his moments fail,"
955,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"Buried in blossoms red and pale,"
956,THE DEATH OF WINTER,While the sweet birds sing his dirges!
957,THE DEATH OF WINTER,
958,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"O Winter!  I’d live that life of thine,"
959,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"With a frosty brow and an icicle tongue,"
960,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"And never a song my whole life long,—"
961,THE DEATH OF WINTER,Were such delicious burial mine!
962,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"To die and be buried, and so remain"
963,THE DEATH OF WINTER,"A wandering brook in April’s train,"
964,THE DEATH OF WINTER,Fixing my dying eyes for aye
965,THE DEATH OF WINTER,On the dawning brows of maiden May.

1013,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1014,THE SLEEPING CITY,A PRINCESS in the eastern tale
1015,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Paced thro’ a marble city pale,"
1016,THE SLEEPING CITY,And saw in ghastly shapes of stone
1017,THE SLEEPING CITY,The sculptured life she breathed alone;
1018,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1019,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Saw, where’er her eye might range,"
1020,THE SLEEPING CITY,Herself the only child of change;
1021,THE SLEEPING CITY,And heard her echoed footfall chime
1022,THE SLEEPING CITY,Between Oblivion and Time;
1023,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1024,THE SLEEPING CITY,"And in the squares where fountains played,"
1025,THE SLEEPING CITY,"And up the spiral balustrade,"
1026,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Along the drowsy corridors,"
1027,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Even to the inmost sleeping floors,"
1028,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1029,THE SLEEPING CITY,Surveyed in wonder chilled with dread
1030,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The seemingness of Death, not dead;"
1031,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Life’s semblance but without its storm,"
1032,THE SLEEPING CITY,And silence frosting every form;
1033,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1034,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Crowned figures, cold and grouping slaves,"
1035,THE SLEEPING CITY,Like suddenly arrested waves
1036,THE SLEEPING CITY,"About to sink, about to rise,—"
1037,THE SLEEPING CITY,Strange meaning in their stricken eyes;
1038,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1039,THE SLEEPING CITY,And cloths and couches live with flame
1040,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Of leopards fierce and lions tame,"
1041,THE SLEEPING CITY,"And hunters in the jungle reed,"
1042,THE SLEEPING CITY,Thrown out by sombre glowing brede;
1043,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1044,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Dumb chambers hushed with fold on fold,"
1045,THE SLEEPING CITY,And cumbrous gorgeousness of gold;
1046,THE SLEEPING CITY,"White casements o’er embroidered seats,"
1047,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Looking on solitudes of streets,—"
1048,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1049,THE SLEEPING CITY,"On palaces and column’d towers,"
1050,THE SLEEPING CITY,Unconscious of the stony hours;
1051,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Harsh gateways startled at a sound,"
1052,THE SLEEPING CITY,With burning lamps all burnish’d round;—
1053,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1054,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Surveyed in awe this wealth and state,"
1055,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Touched by the finger of a Fate,"
1056,THE SLEEPING CITY,And drew with slow-awakening fear
1057,THE SLEEPING CITY,The sternness of the atmosphere;—
1058,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1059,THE SLEEPING CITY,"And gradually, with stealthier foot,"
1060,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Became herself a thing as mute,"
1061,THE SLEEPING CITY,"And listened,—while with swift alarm"
1062,THE SLEEPING CITY,Her alien heart shrank from the charm;
1063,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1064,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Yet as her thoughts dilating rose,"
1065,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Took glory in the great repose,"
1066,THE SLEEPING CITY,And over every postured form
1067,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Spread lava-like and brooded warm,—"
1068,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1069,THE SLEEPING CITY,And fixed on every frozen face
1070,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Beheld the record of its race,"
1071,THE SLEEPING CITY,And in each chiselled feature knew
1072,THE SLEEPING CITY,The stormy life that once blushed thro’;—
1073,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1074,THE SLEEPING CITY,The ever-present of the past
1075,THE SLEEPING CITY,"There written; all that lightened last,"
1076,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Love, anguish, hope, disease, despair,"
1077,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Beauty and rage, all written there;—"
1078,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1079,THE SLEEPING CITY,Enchanted Passions! whose pale doom
1080,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Is never flushed by blight or bloom,"
1081,THE SLEEPING CITY,"But sentinelled by silent orbs,"
1082,THE SLEEPING CITY,Whose light the pallid scene absorbs.—
1083,THE SLEEPING CITY,

1085,THE SLEEPING CITY,This City with its sleeping throng;

1087,THE SLEEPING CITY,"To rapture, and sublimely yearns;—"
1088,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1089,THE SLEEPING CITY,For now the quiet stars look down
1090,THE SLEEPING CITY,On lights as quiet as their own;
1091,THE SLEEPING CITY,The streets that groaned with traffic show
1092,THE SLEEPING CITY,As if with silence paved below;
1093,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1094,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The latest revellers are at peace,"
1095,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The signs of in-door tumult cease,"
1096,THE SLEEPING CITY,"From gay saloon and low resort,"
1097,THE SLEEPING CITY,Comes not one murmur or report:
1098,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1099,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The clattering chariot rolls not by,"
1100,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The windows show no waking eye,"
1101,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The houses smoke not, and the air"
1102,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Is clear, and all the midnight fair."
1103,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1104,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The centre of the striving world,"
1105,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Round which the human fate is curled,"
1106,THE SLEEPING CITY,"To which the future crieth wild,—"
1107,THE SLEEPING CITY,Is pillowed like a cradled child.
1108,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1109,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The palace roof that guards a crown,"
1110,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The mansion swathed in dreamy down,"
1111,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Hovel, court, and alley-shed,"
1112,THE SLEEPING CITY,Sleep in the calmness of the dead.
1113,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1114,THE SLEEPING CITY,Now while the many-motived heart
1115,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Lies hushed—fireside and busy mart,"
1116,THE SLEEPING CITY,And mortal pulses beat the tune
1117,THE SLEEPING CITY,That charms the calm cold ear o’ the moon
1118,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1119,THE SLEEPING CITY,Whose yellowing crescent down the West
1120,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Leans listening, now when every breast"
1121,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Its basest or its purest heaves,"
1122,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The soul that joys, the soul that grieves;—"
1123,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1124,THE SLEEPING CITY,While Fame is crowning happy brows
1125,THE SLEEPING CITY,"That day will blindly scorn, while vows"
1126,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Of anguished love, long hidden, speak"
1127,THE SLEEPING CITY,From faltering tongue and flushing cheek
1128,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1129,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The language only known to dreams,"
1130,THE SLEEPING CITY,Rich eloquence of rosy themes!
1131,THE SLEEPING CITY,While on the Beauty’s folded mouth
1132,THE SLEEPING CITY,Disdain just wrinkles baby youth;
1133,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1134,THE SLEEPING CITY,While Poverty dispenses alms
1135,THE SLEEPING CITY,"To outcasts, bread, and healing balms;"
1136,THE SLEEPING CITY,While old Mammon knows himself
1137,THE SLEEPING CITY,The greatest beggar for his pelf;
1138,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1139,THE SLEEPING CITY,"While noble things in darkness grope,"
1140,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The Statesman’s aim, the Poet’s hope;"
1141,THE SLEEPING CITY,"The Patriot’s impulse gathers fire,"
1142,THE SLEEPING CITY,And germs of future fruits aspire;—
1143,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1144,THE SLEEPING CITY,"Now while dumb nature owns its links,"
1145,THE SLEEPING CITY,"And from one common fountain drinks,"
1146,THE SLEEPING CITY,Methinks in all around I see
1147,THE SLEEPING CITY,This Picture in Eternity;—
1148,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1149,THE SLEEPING CITY,A marbled City planted there
1150,THE SLEEPING CITY,With all its pageants and despair;
1151,THE SLEEPING CITY,"A peopled hush, a Death not dead,"
1152,THE SLEEPING CITY,But stricken with Medusa’s head;—
1153,THE SLEEPING CITY,
1154,THE SLEEPING CITY,And in the Gorgon’s glance for aye
1155,THE SLEEPING CITY,The lifeless immortality
1156,THE SLEEPING CITY,Reveals in sculptured calmness all
1157,THE SLEEPING CITY,Its latest life beyond recall.

1536,THE RAPE OF AURORA,One finger just touching

1602,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Are whistling from the daggered gorse,"
1603,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And hurrying over fern and broom,"
1604,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Midway, far off, he feigns to halt"
1605,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And gather in his streaming train.
1606,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,
1607,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Now, whirring like an eagle’s wing"
1608,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,Preparing for a wide blue flight;

1610,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And chides the wet bewildered mast;
1611,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Now, screaming like an anguish’d thing"
1612,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,Chased close by some down-breathing beak;
1613,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Now, wailing like a breaking heart,"
1614,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"That will not wholly break, but hopes"
1615,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,With hope that knows itself in vain;
1616,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Now, threatening like a storm-charged cloud;"

1622,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,
1623,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Long waited there, for aspens frail"

1626,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"When danger is at hand, and wake"
1627,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"The neighbouring boughs, surrendering all"
1628,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Their prophet harmony of leaves,"
1629,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Had caught his earliest windward thought,"
1630,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And told it trembling; naked birk
1631,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Down showering her dishevelled hair,"
1632,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And like a beauty yielding up
1633,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Her fate to all the elements,"
1634,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Had swayed in answer; hazels close,"
1635,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Thick brambles and dark brushwood tufts,"
1636,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And briared brakes that line the dells
1637,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"With shaggy beetling brows, had sung"
1638,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Shrill music, while the tattered flaws"
1639,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Tore over them, and now the whole"
1640,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Tumultuous concords, seized at once"
1641,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"With savage inspiration,—pine,"
1642,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And larch, and beech, and fir, and thorn,"
1643,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And ash, and oak, and oakling, rave"
1644,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And shriek, and shout, and whirl, and toss,"
1645,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And stretch their arms, and split, and crack,"
1646,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And bend their stems, and bow their heads,"

1652,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"With mighty melodies, sublime,"
1653,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,From clumps of column’d pines that wave
1654,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"A lofty anthem to the sky,"
1655,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,Fit music for a prophet’s soul—
1656,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And like an ocean gathering power,"
1657,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And murmuring deep, while down below"
1658,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,Reigns calm profound;—not trembling now
1659,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"The aspens, but like freshening waves"
1660,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,That fall upon a shingly beach;—
1661,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And round the oak a solemn roll
1662,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Of organ harmony ascends,"
1663,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And in the upper foliage sounds
1664,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,A symphony of distant seas.
1665,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,
1666,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,The voice of nature is abroad
1667,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,This night; she fills the air with balm;
1668,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,Her mystery is o’er the land;
1669,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And who that hears her now and yields
1670,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"His being to her yearning tones,"
1671,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And seats his soul upon her wings,"
1672,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,And broadens o’er the wind-swept world
1673,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"With her, will gather in the flight"
1674,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"More knowledge of her secret, more"
1675,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Delight in her beneficence,"
1676,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Than hours of musing, or the lore"
1677,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,That lives with men could ever give!
1678,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,Nor will it pass away when morn
1679,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Shall look upon the lulling leaves,"
1680,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"And woodland sunshine, Eden-sweet,"
1681,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,Dreams o’er the paths of peaceful shade;—
1682,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,For every elemental power
1683,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Is kindred to our hearts, and once"
1684,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Acknowledged, wedded, once embraced,"
1685,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Once taken to the unfettered sense,"
1686,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,"Once claspt into the naked life,"
1687,SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND,The union is eternal.

1939,DAPHNE,
1940,DAPHNE,"Witless of the enamour’d presence,"
1941,DAPHNE,Like a dreamy lotus bud
1942,DAPHNE,"From its drowsy stem down-drooping,"

1949,DAPHNE,
1950,DAPHNE,"All the air was thrill’d with sunrise,"

1953,DAPHNE,Claspt her image ere she came.
1954,DAPHNE,
1955,DAPHNE,Richer for that glance unconscious!
1956,DAPHNE,Dearer for that soft dismay!
1957,DAPHNE,And the sudden self-possession!
1958,DAPHNE,And the smile as bright as day!
1959,DAPHNE,
1960,DAPHNE,"Plunging ’mid her scattered tresses,"
1961,DAPHNE,With her blue invoking eyes;
1962,DAPHNE,See her like a star descending!
1963,DAPHNE,Like a rosebud see her rise!
1964,DAPHNE,
1965,DAPHNE,Like a rosebud in the morning
1966,DAPHNE,"Dashing off its jewell’d dews,"
1967,DAPHNE,Ere unfolding all its fragrance
1968,DAPHNE,It is gathered by the muse!
1969,DAPHNE,
1970,DAPHNE,Beauteous in the foamy laughter
1971,DAPHNE,"Bubbling round her shrinking waist,"
1972,DAPHNE,Lo! from locks and lips and eyelids
1973,DAPHNE,Rain the glittering pearl-drops chaste!
1974,DAPHNE,
1975,DAPHNE,And about the maiden rapture
1976,DAPHNE,"Still the ruddy ripples play’d,"
1977,DAPHNE,Ebbing round in startled circlets
1978,DAPHNE,When her arms began to wade;
1979,DAPHNE,
1980,DAPHNE,Flowing in like tides attracted
1981,DAPHNE,To the glowing crescent shine!
1982,DAPHNE,Clasping her ambrosial whiteness
1983,DAPHNE,Like an Autumn-tinted vine!
1984,DAPHNE,
1985,DAPHNE,Sinking low with love’s emotion!
1986,DAPHNE,Levying with look and tone
1987,DAPHNE,All love’s rosy arts to mimic
1988,DAPHNE,Cytherea’s magic zone!
1989,DAPHNE,
1990,DAPHNE,Trembling up with adoration
1991,DAPHNE,To the crimson daisy tip
1992,DAPHNE,Budding from the snowy bosom—
1993,DAPHNE,Fainter than the rose-red lip!
1994,DAPHNE,
1995,DAPHNE,"Rising in a storm of wavelets,"
1996,DAPHNE,"That for shelter, feigning fright,"
1997,DAPHNE,"Prest to those twin-heaving havens,"
1998,DAPHNE,Harbour’d there beneath her light;
1999,DAPHNE,
2000,DAPHNE,Gleaming in a whirl of eddies
2001,DAPHNE,Round her lucid throat and neck;
2002,DAPHNE,Eddying in a gleam of dimples
2003,DAPHNE,Up against her bloomy cheek;
2004,DAPHNE,
2005,DAPHNE,Bribing all the breezy water
2006,DAPHNE,"With rich warmth, the nymph to keep"
2007,DAPHNE,"In a self-imprison’d plaisance,"
2008,DAPHNE,Tempting her from deep to deep.
2009,DAPHNE,
2010,DAPHNE,Till at last delirious passion
2011,DAPHNE,"Thrill’d the god to wild excess,"
2012,DAPHNE,And the fervour of a moment
2013,DAPHNE,Made divinity confess;
2014,DAPHNE,
2015,DAPHNE,And he stood in all his glory!
2016,DAPHNE,"But so radiant, being near,"
2017,DAPHNE,That her eyes were frozen on him
2018,DAPHNE,In a fascinated fear!
2019,DAPHNE,
2020,DAPHNE,"All with orient splendour shining,"
2021,DAPHNE,"All with roseate birth aglow,"
2022,DAPHNE,"Gleam’d the golden god before her,"
2023,DAPHNE,With his golden crescent bow.
2024,DAPHNE,
2025,DAPHNE,"Soon the dazzled light subsided,"
2026,DAPHNE,"And he seem’d a beauteous youth,"
2027,DAPHNE,"Form’d to gain the maiden’s murmurs,"
2028,DAPHNE,And to pledge the vows of truth.
2029,DAPHNE,
2030,DAPHNE,Ah! that thus he had continued!
2031,DAPHNE,"O, that such for her had been!"
2032,DAPHNE,"Graceful with all godlike beauty,"
2033,DAPHNE,But so humanly serene!
2034,DAPHNE,
2035,DAPHNE,"Cheeks, and mouth, and mellow ringlets,"
2036,DAPHNE,Bounteous as the mid-day beam;
2037,DAPHNE,"Pleading looks and wistful tremour,"
2038,DAPHNE,Tender as a maiden’s dream!
2039,DAPHNE,
2040,DAPHNE,Palms that like a bird’s throbb’d bosom
2041,DAPHNE,"Palpitate with eagerness,"
2042,DAPHNE,"Lips, the bridals of the roses,"
2043,DAPHNE,Dewy sweet from the caress!
2044,DAPHNE,
2045,DAPHNE,"Lips and limbs, and eyes and ringlets,"
2046,DAPHNE,"Swaying, praying to one prayer,"
2047,DAPHNE,"Like a lyre, swept by a spirit,"
2048,DAPHNE,"In the still, enraptur’d air."
2049,DAPHNE,
2050,DAPHNE,"Like a lyre in some far valley,"
2051,DAPHNE,Uttering ravishments divine!
2052,DAPHNE,All its strings to viewless fingers
2053,DAPHNE,"Yearning, modulations fine!"
2054,DAPHNE,
2055,DAPHNE,Yearning with melodious fervour!
2056,DAPHNE,"Like a beauteous maiden flower,"
2057,DAPHNE,When the young beloved three paces
2058,DAPHNE,Hovers from the bridal bower.
2059,DAPHNE,
2060,DAPHNE,Throbbing thro’ the dawning stillness!
2061,DAPHNE,"As a heart within a breast,"
2062,DAPHNE,When the young beloved is stepping
2063,DAPHNE,Radiant to the nuptial nest.
2064,DAPHNE,
2065,DAPHNE,O for Daphne! gentle Daphne
2066,DAPHNE,Ever warmer by degrees
2067,DAPHNE,Whispers full of hopes and visions
2068,DAPHNE,Throng her ears like honey bees!
2069,DAPHNE,
2070,DAPHNE,Never yet was lonely blossom
2071,DAPHNE,Woo’d with such delicious voice!
2072,DAPHNE,Never since hath mortal maiden
2073,DAPHNE,Dwelt on such celestial choice!
2074,DAPHNE,
2075,DAPHNE,"Love-suffused she quivers, falters—"
2076,DAPHNE,"Falters, sighs, but never speaks,"
2077,DAPHNE,All her rosy blood up-gushing
2078,DAPHNE,Overflows her ripe young cheeks.
2079,DAPHNE,
2080,DAPHNE,"Blushing, sweet with virgin blushes,"
2081,DAPHNE,"All her loveliness a-flame,"
2082,DAPHNE,"Stands she in the orient waters,"
2083,DAPHNE,Stricken o’er with speechless shame!
2084,DAPHNE,
2085,DAPHNE,"Ah! but lovelier, ever lovelier,"
2086,DAPHNE,"As more deep the colour glows,"
2087,DAPHNE,And the honey-laden lily
2088,DAPHNE,Changes to the fragrant rose.
2089,DAPHNE,
2090,DAPHNE,"While the god with meek embraces,"
2091,DAPHNE,"Whispering all his sacred charms,"
2092,DAPHNE,"Softly folds her, gently holds her,"
2093,DAPHNE,In his white encircling arms!
2094,DAPHNE,
2095,DAPHNE,"But, O Dian! veil not wholly"
2096,DAPHNE,Thy pale crescent from the morn!
2097,DAPHNE,"Vanish not, O virgin goddess,"
2098,DAPHNE,With that look of pallid scorn!
2099,DAPHNE,
2100,DAPHNE,Still thy pure protecting influence
2101,DAPHNE,Shed from those fair watchful eyes!—
2102,DAPHNE,"Lo! her angry orb has vanished,"
2103,DAPHNE,And the bright sun thrones the skies!
2104,DAPHNE,
2105,DAPHNE,Voicelessly the forest Virgin
2106,DAPHNE,Vanished! but one look she gave—
2107,DAPHNE,Keen as Niobean arrow
2108,DAPHNE,Thro’ the maiden’s heart it drave.
2109,DAPHNE,
2110,DAPHNE,Thus toward that throning bosom
2111,DAPHNE,"Where all earth is warmed,—each spot"
2112,DAPHNE,Nourished with autumnal blessings—
2113,DAPHNE,Icy chill was Daphne caught.
2114,DAPHNE,
2115,DAPHNE,Icy chill! but swift revulsion
2116,DAPHNE,"All her gentler self renewed,"
2117,DAPHNE,Even as icy Winter quickens
2118,DAPHNE,With bud-opening warmth imbued.
2119,DAPHNE,
2120,DAPHNE,"Even as a torpid brooklet,"
2121,DAPHNE,That to the night-gleaming moon
2122,DAPHNE,"Flashed in turn the frozen glances,"
2123,DAPHNE,Melts upon the breast of noon.
2124,DAPHNE,
2125,DAPHNE,"But no more—O never, never,"
2126,DAPHNE,"Turns she to that bosom bright,"
2127,DAPHNE,"Swiftly all her senses counsel,"
2128,DAPHNE,All her nerves are strung to flight.
2129,DAPHNE,
2130,DAPHNE,O’er the brows of radiant Pindus
2131,DAPHNE,"Rolls a shadow dark and cold,"
2132,DAPHNE,And a sound of lamentation
2133,DAPHNE,Issues from its mournful fold.
2134,DAPHNE,
2135,DAPHNE,Voice of the far-sighted Muses!
2136,DAPHNE,Cry of keen foreboding song!
2137,DAPHNE,Every cleft of startled Tempe
2138,DAPHNE,Tingles with it sharp and long.
2139,DAPHNE,
2140,DAPHNE,"Over bourn and bosk and dingle,"
2141,DAPHNE,"Over rivers, over rills,"
2142,DAPHNE,Runs the sad subservient Echo
2143,DAPHNE,Toward the dim blue distant hills!
2144,DAPHNE,
2145,DAPHNE,And another and another!
2146,DAPHNE,’Tis a cry more wild than all;
2147,DAPHNE,And the hills with muffled voices
2148,DAPHNE,Answer ‘Daphne!’ to the call.
2149,DAPHNE,
2150,DAPHNE,And another and another!
2151,DAPHNE,"’Tis a cry so wildly sweet,"
2152,DAPHNE,That her charmed heart turns rebel
2153,DAPHNE,To the instinct of her feet;
2154,DAPHNE,
2155,DAPHNE,And she pauses for an instant;
2156,DAPHNE,But his arms have scarcely slid
2157,DAPHNE,"Round her waist in cestian girdles,"
2158,DAPHNE,And his low voluptuous lid
2159,DAPHNE,
2160,DAPHNE,"Lifted pleading, and the honey"
2161,DAPHNE,"Of his mouth for hers athirst,"
2162,DAPHNE,"Ruby glistening, raised for moisture—"
2163,DAPHNE,Like a bud that waits to burst
2164,DAPHNE,
2165,DAPHNE,In the sweet espousing showers—
2166,DAPHNE,And his tongue has scarce begun
2167,DAPHNE,"With its inarticulate burthen,"
2168,DAPHNE,And the clouds scarce show the sun
2169,DAPHNE,
2170,DAPHNE,As it pierces thro’ a crevice
2171,DAPHNE,"Of the mass that closed it o’er,"
2172,DAPHNE,When again the horror flashes—
2173,DAPHNE,And she turns to flight once more!
2174,DAPHNE,
2175,DAPHNE,And again o’er radiant Pindus
2176,DAPHNE,"Rolls the shadow dark and cold,"
2177,DAPHNE,And the sound of lamentation
2178,DAPHNE,Issues from its sable fold!
2179,DAPHNE,
2180,DAPHNE,And again the light winds chide her
2181,DAPHNE,As she darts from his embrace—
2182,DAPHNE,And again the far-voiced echoes
2183,DAPHNE,Speak their tidings of the chase.
2184,DAPHNE,
2185,DAPHNE,"Loudly now as swiftly, swiftly,"
2186,DAPHNE,O’er the glimmering sands she speeds;
2187,DAPHNE,Wildly now as in the furzes
2188,DAPHNE,From the piercing spikes she bleeds.
2189,DAPHNE,
2190,DAPHNE,"Deeply and with direful anguish,"
2191,DAPHNE,As above each crimson drop
2192,DAPHNE,"Passion checks the god Apollo,"
2193,DAPHNE,And love bids him weep and stop.—
2194,DAPHNE,
2195,DAPHNE,He above each drop of crimson
2196,DAPHNE,Shadowing—like the laurel leaf
2197,DAPHNE,That above himself will shadow—
2198,DAPHNE,Sheds a fadeless look of grief.
2199,DAPHNE,
2200,DAPHNE,"Then with love’s remorseful discord,"
2201,DAPHNE,"With its own desire at war,"
2202,DAPHNE,"Sighing turns, while dimly fleeting"
2203,DAPHNE,Daphne flies the chase afar.
2204,DAPHNE,
2205,DAPHNE,But all nature is against her!
2206,DAPHNE,"Pan, with all his sylvan troop,"
2207,DAPHNE,Thro’ the vista’d woodland valleys
2208,DAPHNE,Blocks her course with cry and whoop!
2209,DAPHNE,
2210,DAPHNE,In the twilights of the thickets
2211,DAPHNE,"Trees bend down their gnarled boughs,"
2212,DAPHNE,Wild green leaves and low curved branches
2213,DAPHNE,Hold her hair and beat her brows.
2214,DAPHNE,
2215,DAPHNE,"Many a brake of brushwood covert,"
2216,DAPHNE,"Where cold darkness slumbers mute,"
2217,DAPHNE,"Slips a shrub to thwart her passage,"
2218,DAPHNE,Slides a hand to clutch her foot.
2219,DAPHNE,
2220,DAPHNE,Glens and glades of lushest verdure
2221,DAPHNE,"Toil her in their tawny mesh,"
2222,DAPHNE,Wilder-woofed ways and alleys
2223,DAPHNE,Lock her struggling limbs in leash.
2224,DAPHNE,
2225,DAPHNE,"Feathery grasses, flowery mosses,"
2226,DAPHNE,Knot themselves to make her trip;
2227,DAPHNE,Sprays and stubborn sprigs outstretching
2228,DAPHNE,Put a bridle on her lip;
2229,DAPHNE,
2230,DAPHNE,"Many a winding lane betrays her,"
2231,DAPHNE,"Many a sudden bosky shoot,"
2232,DAPHNE,And her knee makes many a stumble
2233,DAPHNE,"O’er some hidden damp old root,"
2234,DAPHNE,
2235,DAPHNE,Whose quaint face peers green and dusky
2236,DAPHNE,"’Mongst the matted growth of plants,"
2237,DAPHNE,"While she rises wild and weltering,"
2238,DAPHNE,Speeding on with many pants.
2239,DAPHNE,
2240,DAPHNE,Tangles of the wild red strawberry
2241,DAPHNE,Spread their freckled trammels frail;
2242,DAPHNE,In the pathway creeping brambles
2243,DAPHNE,Catch her in their thorny trail.
2244,DAPHNE,
2245,DAPHNE,All the widely sweeping greensward
2246,DAPHNE,Shifts and swims from knoll to knoll;
2247,DAPHNE,Grey rough-fingered oak and elm wood
2248,DAPHNE,Push her by from bole to bole.
2249,DAPHNE,
2250,DAPHNE,"Groves of lemon, groves of citron,"
2251,DAPHNE,"Tall high-foliaged plane and palm,"
2252,DAPHNE,"Bloomy myrtle, light-blue olive,"
2253,DAPHNE,Wave her back with gusts of balm.
2254,DAPHNE,
2255,DAPHNE,"Languid jasmine, scrambling briony,"
2256,DAPHNE,"Walls of close-festooning braid,"
2257,DAPHNE,"Fling themselves about her, mingling"
2258,DAPHNE,"With her wafted looks, waylaid."
2259,DAPHNE,
2260,DAPHNE,"Twisting bindweed, honey’d woodbine,"
2261,DAPHNE,"Cling to her, while, red and blue,"
2262,DAPHNE,On her rounded form ripe berries
2263,DAPHNE,Dash and die in gory dew.
2264,DAPHNE,
2265,DAPHNE,Running ivies dark and lingering
2266,DAPHNE,Round her light limbs drag and twine;
2267,DAPHNE,Round her waist with languorous tendrils
2268,DAPHNE,Reels and wreathes the juicy vine;
2269,DAPHNE,
2270,DAPHNE,Reining in the flying creature
2271,DAPHNE,With its arms about her mouth;
2272,DAPHNE,Bursting all its mellowing bunches
2273,DAPHNE,To seduce her husky drouth;
2274,DAPHNE,
2275,DAPHNE,Crowning her with amorous clusters;
2276,DAPHNE,Pouring down her sloping back
2277,DAPHNE,"Fresh-born wines in glittering rillets,"
2278,DAPHNE,Following her in crimson track.
2279,DAPHNE,
2280,DAPHNE,"Buried, drenched in dewy foliage,"
2281,DAPHNE,"Thus she glimmers from the dawn,"
2282,DAPHNE,"Watched by every forest creature,"
2283,DAPHNE,"Fleet-foot Oread, frolic Faun."
2284,DAPHNE,
2285,DAPHNE,Silver-sandalled Arethusa
2286,DAPHNE,"Not more swiftly fled the sands,"
2287,DAPHNE,"Fled the plains and fled the sunlights,"
2288,DAPHNE,Fled the murmuring ocean strands.
2289,DAPHNE,
2290,DAPHNE,"O, that now the earth would open!"
2291,DAPHNE,"O, that now the shades would hide!"
2292,DAPHNE,"O, that now the gods would shelter!"
2293,DAPHNE,Caverns lead and seas divide!
2294,DAPHNE,
2295,DAPHNE,Not more faint soft-lowing Io
2296,DAPHNE,"Panted in those starry eyes,"
2297,DAPHNE,When the sleepless midnight meadows
2298,DAPHNE,Piteously implored the skies!
2299,DAPHNE,
2300,DAPHNE,Still her breathless flight she urges
2301,DAPHNE,"By the sanctuary stream,"
2302,DAPHNE,And the god with golden swiftness
2303,DAPHNE,Follows like an eastern beam.
2304,DAPHNE,
2305,DAPHNE,Her the close bewildering greenery
2306,DAPHNE,"Darkens with its duskiest green,—"
2307,DAPHNE,"Him each little leaflet welcomes,"
2308,DAPHNE,Flushing with an orient sheen.
2309,DAPHNE,
2310,DAPHNE,"Thus he nears, and now all Tempe"
2311,DAPHNE,"Rings with his melodious cry,"
2312,DAPHNE,Avenues and blue expanses
2313,DAPHNE,Beam in his large lustrous eye!
2314,DAPHNE,
2315,DAPHNE,All the branches start to music!
2316,DAPHNE,As if from a secret spring
2317,DAPHNE,Thousands of sweet bills are bubbling
2318,DAPHNE,In the nest and on the wing.
2319,DAPHNE,
2320,DAPHNE,Gleams and shines the glassy river
2321,DAPHNE,And rich valleys every one;
2322,DAPHNE,But of all the throbbing beauty
2323,DAPHNE,Brightest! singled by the sun!
2324,DAPHNE,
2325,DAPHNE,"Ivy round her glimmering ancle,"
2326,DAPHNE,"Vine about her glowing brow,"
2327,DAPHNE,"Never sure was bride so beauteous,"
2328,DAPHNE,"Daphne, chosen nymph, as thou!"
2329,DAPHNE,
2330,DAPHNE,Thus he nears! and now she feels him
2331,DAPHNE,Breathing hot on every limb;
2332,DAPHNE,And he hears her own quick pantings—
2333,DAPHNE,Ah! that they might be for him.
2334,DAPHNE,
2335,DAPHNE,"O, that like the flower he tramples,"
2336,DAPHNE,"Bending from his golden tread,"
2337,DAPHNE,"Full of fair celestial ardours,"
2338,DAPHNE,She would bow her bridal head.
2339,DAPHNE,
2340,DAPHNE,"O, that like the flower she presses,"
2341,DAPHNE,"Nodding from her lily touch,"
2342,DAPHNE,"Light as in the harmless breezes,"
2343,DAPHNE,She would know the god for such!
2344,DAPHNE,
2345,DAPHNE,See! the golden arms are round her—
2346,DAPHNE,To the air she grasps and clings!
2347,DAPHNE,See! his glowing arms have wound her—
2348,DAPHNE,To the sky she shrieks and springs!
2349,DAPHNE,
2350,DAPHNE,See! the flushing chace of Tempe
2351,DAPHNE,Trembles with Olympian air—
2352,DAPHNE,See! green sprigs and buds are shooting
2353,DAPHNE,From those white raised arms of prayer!
2354,DAPHNE,
2355,DAPHNE,In the earth her feet are rooting!—
2356,DAPHNE,"Breasts and limbs and lifted eyes,"
2357,DAPHNE,"Hair and lips and stretching fingers,"
2358,DAPHNE,Fade away—and fadeless rise.
2359,DAPHNE,
2360,DAPHNE,And the god whose fervent rapture
2361,DAPHNE,Clasps her finds his close embrace
2362,DAPHNE,"Full of palpitating branches,"
2363,DAPHNE,"And new leaves that bud apace,"
2364,DAPHNE,
2365,DAPHNE,Bound his wonder-stricken forehead;—
2366,DAPHNE,While in ebbing measures slow
2367,DAPHNE,Sounds of softly dying pulses
2368,DAPHNE,"Pause and quiver, pause and go;"
2369,DAPHNE,
2370,DAPHNE,"Go, and come again, and flutter"
2371,DAPHNE,"On the verge of life,—then flee!"
2372,DAPHNE,All the white ambrosial beauty
2373,DAPHNE,Is a lustrous Laurel Tree!
2374,DAPHNE,
2375,DAPHNE,Still with the great panting love-chase
2376,DAPHNE,All its running sap is warmed;—
2377,DAPHNE,But from head to foot the virgin
2378,DAPHNE,Is transfigured and transformed.
2379,DAPHNE,
2380,DAPHNE,Changed!—yet the green Dryad nature
2381,DAPHNE,"Is instinct with human ties,"
2382,DAPHNE,And above its anguish’d lover
2383,DAPHNE,Breathes pathetic sympathies;
2384,DAPHNE,
2385,DAPHNE,Sympathies of love and sorrow;
2386,DAPHNE,Joy in her divine escape;
2387,DAPHNE,Breathing through her bursting foliage
2388,DAPHNE,Comfort to his bending shape.
2389,DAPHNE,
2390,DAPHNE,Vainly now the floating Naiads
2391,DAPHNE,"Seek to pierce the laurel maze,"
2392,DAPHNE,"Nought but laurel meets their glances,"
2393,DAPHNE,Laurel glistens as they gaze.
2394,DAPHNE,
2395,DAPHNE,Nought but bright prophetic laurel!
2396,DAPHNE,"Laurel over eyes and brows,"
2397,DAPHNE,"Over limbs and over bosom,"
2398,DAPHNE,Laurel leaves and laurel boughs!
2399,DAPHNE,
2400,DAPHNE,And in vain the listening Dryad
2401,DAPHNE,Shells her hand against her ear!—
2402,DAPHNE,All is silence—save the echo
2403,DAPHNE,Travelling in the distance drear.

2617,I,
2618,I,"Beneath a sky of summer blue,"

2678,II,
2679,II,"To others ’tis an Autumn trust,"

2683,II,A temple naked to the clouds;

2685,II,
2686,II,Heaving with adoration! there

2701,II,Sighs hush! and all the land is still;
2702,II,"When, from the lush empurpling East,"
2703,II,The twilight of the crowing cock
2704,II,"Peers on the drowsy village roofs,"
2705,II,Athwart the heavens that glimmering line is seen.
2706,II,
2707,II,"And now beneath the rising sun,"
2708,II,Whose shining chariot overpeers

2718,II,With gentle love directs him how
2719,II,To wed the willing earth and hope for fruits!

2728,II,"Whatever dim tradition tells,"
2729,II,"Whatever history may reveal,"
2730,II,"Or fancy, from her starry brows,"
2731,II,"Of light or dreamful lustre shed,"
2732,II,Could not at this sweet time increase
2733,II,The quiet consecration of the spot.
2734,II,
2735,II,"Blest with the sweat of labour, blest"
2736,II,"With the young sun’s first vigorous beams,"
2737,II,"Village hope and harvest prayer,—"
2738,II,The heart that throbs beneath it holds
2739,II,A bliss so perfect in itself
2740,II,Men’s thoughts must borrow rather than bestow.

2753,III,"Rises, like a fledgling,"
2754,III,"Whose wings are not mature, but still"
2755,III,Supported by its strong desire
2756,III,Beats up its native air and leaves
2757,III,The tender mother’s nest.

2786,IV,That dallies with dead leaves ev’n while the primrose peeps.
2787,IV,

2903,VII,"Mute with the cares of the nest; only known by a ‘chuck, chuck,’ and"

2909,VII,"Singing o’er hyacinths hid, and most honey’d of flowers, white"
2910,VII,field-rose.
2911,VII,Joy thus to revel all day in the grass of our own beloved country;
2912,VII,"Revel all day, till the lark mounts at eve with his sweet"
2913,VII,‘tirra-lirra’:
2914,VII,"Trilling delightfully.  See, on the river the slow-rippled surface"
2915,VII,Shining; the slow ripple broadens in circles; the bright surface
2916,VII,smoothens;
2917,VII,Now it is flat as the leaves of the yet unseen water-lily.
2918,VII,"There dart the lives of a day, ever-varying tactics fantastic."

2923,VII,
2924,VII,"Joy thus to revel all day, till the twilight turns us homeward!"
2925,VII,"Till all the lingering deep-blooming splendour of sunset is over,"
2926,VII,"And the one star shines mildly in mellowing hues, like a spirit"
2927,VII,"Sent to assure us that light never dieth, tho’ day is now buried."
2928,VII,"Saying: to-morrow, to-morrow, few hours intervening, that interval"
2929,VII,"Tuned by the woodlark in heaven, to-morrow my semblance, far eastward,"
2930,VII,Heralds the day ’tis my mission eternal to seal and to prophecy.
2931,VII,"Come then, and homeward; passing down the close path of the meadows."
2932,VII,Home like the bees stored with sweetness; each with a lark in the

3450,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Long distances, till with black shipwreck swoln,"
3451,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,It flings its angry mane about the sky.
3452,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And like that billow heaving ere it burst;
3453,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And like that cloud urged by impulsive storm
3454,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With charge of thunder, lightning, and the drench"
3455,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of torrents, thou in all thy majesty"
3456,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of mightiness didst fall upon the war!
3457,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Remember that great moment!  Nor forget
3458,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The aid I gave thee; how my ready spear
3459,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Flew swiftly seconding thy mortal stroke,"
3460,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Where’er the press was hottest; never slacked
3461,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"My arm its duty, nor mine eye its aim,"
3462,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Though terribly they compassed us, and stood"
3463,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Thick as an Autumn forest, whose brown hair,"
3464,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Lustrous with sunlight, by the still increase"
3465,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of heat to glowing heat conceives like zeal
3466,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of radiance, till at the pitch of noon"
3467,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,’Tis seized with conflagration and distends
3468,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Horridly over leagues of doom’d domain;
3469,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Mingling the screams of birds, the cries of brutes,"
3470,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The wail of creatures in the covert pent,"
3471,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Howls, yells, and shrieks of agony, the hiss"
3472,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of seething sap, and crash of falling boughs"
3473,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Together in its dull voracious roar.
3474,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"So closely and so fearfully they throng’d,"
3475,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Savage with phantasies of victory,"
3476,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,A sea of dusky shapes; for day had passed
3477,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And night fell on their darkened faces, red"
3478,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,With fight and torchflare; shrill the resonant air
3479,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With eager shouts, and hoarse with angry groans;"
3480,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"While over all the dense and sullen boom,"
3481,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The din and murmur of the myriads,"
3482,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Rolled with its awful intervals, as though"
3483,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The battle breathed, or as against the shore"
3484,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Waves gather back to heave themselves anew.
3485,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"That night sleep dropped not from the dreary skies,"
3486,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Nor could the prowess of our chiefs oppose
3487,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,That sea of raging men.  But what were they?
3488,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Or what is man opposed to thee?  Its hopes
3489,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Are wrecks, himself the drowning, drifting weed"
3490,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,That wanders on thy waters; such as I
3491,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Who see the scattered remnants of my fleet,"
3492,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Remembering the day when first we sailed,"
3493,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Each glad ship shining like the morning star
3494,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,With promise for the world.  Oh! such as I
3495,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Thus darkly drifting on the drowning waves.
3496,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,O God of waters! ’tis a dreadful thing
3497,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,To suffer for an evil unrevealed;
3498,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Dreadful it is to hear the perishing cry
3499,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of those we love; the silence that succeeds
3500,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,How dreadful!  Still my trust is fixed on thee
3501,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,For those that still remain and for myself.
3502,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And if I hear thy swift foam-snorting steeds
3503,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Drawing thy dusky chariot, as in"
3504,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The pauses of the wind I seem to hear,"
3505,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Deaf thou art not to my entreating prayer!
3506,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Haste then to give us help, for closely now"
3507,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Crete whispers in my ears, and all my blood"
3508,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Runs keen and warm for home, and I have yearning,"
3509,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Such yearning as I never felt before,"
3510,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"To see again my wife, my little son,"
3511,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"My Queen, my pretty nursling of five years,"
3512,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The darling of my hopes, our dearest pledge"
3513,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of marriage, and our brightest prize of love,"
3514,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Whose parting cry rings clearest in my heart.
3515,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"O lay this horror, much-offended God!"
3516,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And making all as fair and firm as when
3517,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"We trusted to thy mighty depths of old,—"
3518,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,I vow to sacrifice the first whom Zeus
3519,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Shall prompt to hail us from the white seashore
3520,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And welcome our return to royal Crete,"
3521,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"An offering, Poseidon, unto thee!"
3522,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,
3523,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Amid the din of elemental strife,"
3524,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,No voice may pierce but Deity supreme:
3525,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And Deity supreme alone can hear,"
3526,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Above the hurricane’s discordant shrieks,"
3527,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The cry of agonized humanity.
3528,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,
3529,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Not unappeased was He who smites the waves,"
3530,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,When to his stormy ears the warrior’s vow
3531,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Entered, and from his foamy pinnacle"
3532,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Tumultuous he beheld the prostrate form,"
3533,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And knew the mighty heart.  Awhile he gazed,"
3534,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"As doubtful of his purpose, and the storm,"
3535,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Conscious of that divine debate, withheld"
3536,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Its fierce emotion, in the luminous gloom"
3537,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of those so dark irradiating eyes!
3538,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Beneath whose wavering lustre shone revealed
3539,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The tumult of the purpling deeps, and all"
3540,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The throbbing of the tempest, as it paused,"
3541,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Slowly subsiding, seeming to await"
3542,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The sudden signal, as a faithful hound"
3543,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Pants with the forepaws stretched before its nose,"
3544,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Athwart the greensward, after an eager chase;"
3545,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Its hot tongue thrust to cool, its foamy jaws"
3546,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Open to let the swift breath come and go,"
3547,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Its quick interrogating eyes fixed keen
3548,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Upon the huntsman’s countenance, and ever"
3549,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Lashing its sharp impatient tail with haste:
3550,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Prompt at the slightest sign to scour away,"
3551,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And hang itself afresh by the bleeding fangs,"
3552,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Upon the neck of some death-singled stag,"
3553,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Whose royal antlers, eyes, and stumbling knees"
3554,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Will supplicate the Gods in mute despair.
3555,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"This time not mute, nor yet in vain this time!"
3556,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,For still the burden of the earnest voice
3557,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And all the vivid glories it revoked
3558,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Sank in the God, with that absorbed suspense"
3559,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Felt only by the Olympians, whose minds"
3560,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Unbounded like our mortal brain, perceive"
3561,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"All things complete, the end, the aim of all;"
3562,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,To whom the crown and consequence of deeds
3563,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Are ever present with the deed itself.
3564,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,
3565,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And now the pouring surges, vast and smooth,"
3566,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Grew weary of restraint, and heaved themselves"
3567,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Headlong beneath him, breaking at his feet"
3568,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,With wild importunate cries and angry wail;
3569,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Like crowds that shout for bread and hunger more.
3570,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And now the surface of their rolling backs
3571,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Was ridged with foam-topt furrows, rising high"
3572,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And dashing wildly, like to fiery steeds,"
3573,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Fresh from the Thracian or Thessalian plains,"
3574,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"High-blooded mares just tempering to the bit,"
3575,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Whose manes at full-speed stream upon the winds,"
3576,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And in whose delicate nostrils when the gust
3577,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Breathes of their native plains, they ramp and rear,"
3578,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Frothing the curb, and bounding from the earth,"
3579,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,As though the Sun-god’s chariot alone
3580,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Were fit to follow in their flashing track.
3581,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Anon with gathering stature to the height
3582,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of those colossal giants, doomed long since"
3583,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"To torturous grief and penance, that assailed"
3584,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The sky-throned courts of Zeus, and climbing, dared"
3585,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"For once in a world the Olympic wrath, and braved"
3586,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The electric spirit which from his clenching hand
3587,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Pierces the dark-veined earth, and with a touch"
3588,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Is death to mortals, fearfully they grew!"
3589,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And with like purpose of audacity
3590,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Threatened Titanic fury to the God.
3591,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Such was the agitation of the sea
3592,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Beneath Poseidon’s thought-revolving brows,"
3593,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Storming for signal.  But no signal came.
3594,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And as when men, who congregate to hear"
3595,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Some proclamation from the regal fount,"
3596,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,With eager questioning and anxious phrase
3597,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Betray the expectation of their hearts,"
3598,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Till after many hours of fretful sloth,"
3599,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Weary with much delay, they hold discourse"
3600,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"In sullen groups and cloudy masses, stirred"
3601,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With rage irresolute and whispering plot,"
3602,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Known more by indication than by word,"
3603,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And understood alone by those whose minds
3604,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Participate;—even so the restless waves
3605,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Began to lose all sense of servitude,"
3606,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And worked with rebel passions, bursting, now"
3607,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"To right, and now to left, but evermore"
3608,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Subdued with influence, and controlled with dread"
3609,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of that inviolate Authority.
3610,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Then, swiftly as he mused, the impetuous God"
3611,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Seized on the pausing reins, his coursers plunged,"
3612,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,His brows resumed the grandeur of their ire;
3613,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Throughout his vast divinity the deeps
3614,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Concurrent thrilled with action, and away,"
3615,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,As sweeps a thunder-cloud across the sky
3616,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"In harvest-time, preluded by dull blasts;"
3617,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Or some black-visaged whirlwind, whose wide folds"
3618,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Rush, wrestling on with all ’twixt heaven and earth,"
3619,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Darkling he hurried, and his distant voice,"
3620,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Not softened by delay, was heard in tones"
3621,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Distinctly terrible, still following up"
3622,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Its rapid utterance of tremendous wrath
3623,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,With hoarse reverberations; like the roar
3624,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of lions when they hunger, and awake"
3625,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The sullen echoes from their forest sleep,"
3626,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,To speed the ravenous noise from hill to hill
3627,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And startle victims; but more awful, He,"
3628,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Scudding across the hills that rise and sink,"
3629,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With foam, and splash, and cataracts of spray,"
3630,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Clothed in majestic splendour; girt about
3631,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,With Sea-gods and swift creatures of the sea;
3632,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Their briny eyes blind with the showering drops;
3633,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Their stormy locks, salt tongues, and scaly backs,"
3634,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Quivering in harmony with the tempest, fierce"
3635,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And eager with tempestuous delight;—
3636,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,He like a moving rock above them all
3637,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Solemnly towering while fitful gleams
3638,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Brake from his dense black forehead, which display’d"
3639,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The enduring chiefs as their distracted fleets
3640,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Tossed, toiling with the waters, climbing high,"
3641,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And plunging downward with determined beaks,"
3642,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,In lurid anguish; but the Cretan king
3643,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And all his crew were ’ware of under-tides,"
3644,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"That for the groaning vessel made a path,"
3645,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,On which the impending and precipitous waves
3646,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Fell not, nor suck’d to their abysmal gorge."
3647,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,
3648,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"O, happy they to feel the mighty God,"
3649,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Without his whelming presence near: to feel
3650,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Safety and sweet relief from such despair,"
3651,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And gushing of their weary hopes once more
3652,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Within their fond warm hearts, tired limbs, and eyes"
3653,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Heavy with much fatigue and want of sleep!
3654,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Prayers did not lack; like mountain springs they came,"
3655,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"After the earth has drunk the drenching rains,"
3656,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And throws her fresh-born jets into the sun
3657,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,With joyous sparkles;—for there needed not
3658,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Evidence more serene of instant grace,"
3659,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Immortal mercy! and the sense which follows
3660,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Divine interposition, when the shock"
3661,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of danger hath been thwarted by the Gods,"
3662,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Visibly, and through supplication deep,—"
3663,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Rose in them, chiefly in the royal mind"
3664,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of him whose interceding vow had saved.
3665,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Tears from that great heroic soul sprang up;
3666,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Not painful as in grief, nor smarting keen"
3667,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With shame of weeping; but calm, fresh, and sweet;"
3668,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Such as in lofty spirits rise, and wed"
3669,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The nature of the woman to the man;
3670,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,A sight most lovely to the Gods!  They fell
3671,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Like showers of starlight from his steadfast eyes,"
3672,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"As ever towards the prow he gazed, nor moved"
3673,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"One muscle, with firm lips and level lids,"
3674,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Motionless; while the winds sang in his ears,"
3675,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And took the length of his brown hair in streams
3676,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Behind him.  Thus the hours passed, and the oars"
3677,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Plied without pause, and nothing but the sound"
3678,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of the dull rowlocks and still watery sough,"
3679,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Far off, the carnage of the storm, was heard."
3680,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"For nothing spake the mariners in their toil,"
3681,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And all the captains of the war were dumb:
3682,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Too much oppressed with wonder, too much thrilled"
3683,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"By their great chieftain’s silence, to disturb"
3684,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Such meditation with poor human speech.
3685,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Meantime the moon through slips of driving cloud
3686,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Came forth, and glanced athwart the seas a path"
3687,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of dusky splendour, like the Hadean brows,"
3688,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,When with Elysian passion they behold
3689,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Persephone’s complacent hueless cheeks.
3690,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Soon gathering strength and lustre, as a ship"
3691,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,That swims into some blue and open bay
3692,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With bright full-bosomed sails, the radiant car"
3693,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of Artemis advanced, and on the waves"
3694,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Sparkled like arrows from her silver bow
3695,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The keenness of her pure and tender gaze.
3696,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,
3697,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Then, slowly, one by one the chiefs sought rest;"
3698,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The watches being set, and men to relieve"
3699,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The rowers at midseason.  Fair it was
3700,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"To see them as they lay!  Some up the prow,"
3701,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Some round the helm, in open-handed sleep;"
3702,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With casques unloosed, and bucklers put aside;"
3703,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The ten years’ tale of war upon their cheeks,"
3704,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Where clung the salt wet locks, and on their breasts"
3705,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Beards, the thick growth of many a proud campaign;"
3706,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And on their brows the bright invisible crown
3707,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Victory sheds from her own radiant form,"
3708,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,As o’er her favourites’ heads she sings and soars.
3709,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,But dreams came not so calmly; as around
3710,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Turbulent shores wild waves and swamping surf
3711,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Prevail, while seaward, on the tranquil deeps,"
3712,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Reign placid surfaces and solemn peace,"
3713,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"So, from the troubled strands of memory, they"
3714,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Launched and were tossed, long ere they found the tides"
3715,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,That lead to the gentle bosoms of pure rest.
3716,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And like to one who from a ghostly watch
3717,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"In a lone house where murder hath been done,"
3718,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And secret violations, pale with stealth"
3719,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Emerges, staggering on the first chill gust"
3720,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Wherewith the morning greets him, feeling not"
3721,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Its balmy freshness on his bloodless cheek,—"
3722,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"But swift to hide his midnight face afar,"
3723,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,’Mongst the old woods and timid-glancing flowers
3724,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Hastens, till on the fresh reviving breasts"
3725,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of tender Dryads folded he forgets
3726,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The pallid witness of those nameless things,"
3727,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"In renovated senses lapt, and joins"
3728,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The full, keen joyance of the day, so they"
3729,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"From sights and sounds of battle smeared with blood,"
3730,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And shrieking souls on Acheron’s bleak tides,"
3731,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And wail of execrating kindred, slid"
3732,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Into oblivious slumber and a sense
3733,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of satiate deliciousness complete.
3734,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,
3735,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Leave them, O Muse, in that so happy sleep!"
3736,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Leave them to reap the harvest of their toil,"
3737,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"While fast in moonlight the glad vessel glides,"
3738,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,As if instinctive to its forest home.
3739,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"O Muse, that in all sorrows and all joys,"
3740,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Rapturous bliss and suffering divine,"
3741,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Dwellest with equal fervour, in the calm"
3742,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Of thy serene philosophy, albeit"
3743,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Thy gentle nature is of joy alone,"
3744,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And loves the pipings of the happy fields,"
3745,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Better than all the great parade and pomp
3746,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Which forms the train of heroes and of kings,"

3748,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"That choke with sobs thy singing,—turn away"
3749,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Thy lustrous eyes back to the oath-bound man!

3751,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The lofty figure of the king is seen,"
3752,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Standing above his warriors as they sleep:

3759,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,In thy prophetic sympathy the thought
3760,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Of him whose destiny has heard its doom:
3761,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The Sacrifice thro’ whom the ship is saved.
3762,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Haply that Sacrifice is sleeping now,"
3763,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And dreams of glad tomorrows.  Haply now,"
3764,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"His hopes are keenest, and his fervent blood"
3765,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Richest with youth, and love, and fond regard!"
3766,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Round him the circle of affections blooms,"

3768,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"One name oft uttering in delighted ears,"
3769,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Mother! at which the heart of men are kin
3770,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"With reverence and yearning.  Haply, too,"
3771,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"That other name, twin holy, twin revered,"
3772,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,He whispers often to the passing winds
3773,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,That blow toward the Asiatic coasts;
3774,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"For Crete has sent her bravest to the war,"
3775,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"And multitudes pressed forward to that rank,"
3776,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Men with sad weeping wives and little ones.
3777,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"That other name—O Father! who art thou,"
3778,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Thus doomed to lose the star of thy last days?
3779,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"It may be the sole flower of thy life,"
3780,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,And that of all who now look up to thee!
3781,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"O Father, Father! unto thee even now"
3782,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Fate cries; the future with imploring voice
3783,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Cries ‘Save me,’ ‘Save me,’ though thou hearest not."

3785,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,Even now the dark inexorable deed
3786,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Is dealing its relentless stroke, and vain"
3787,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Are prayers, and tears, and struggles, and despair!"
3788,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"The mother’s tears, the nation’s stormful grief,"
3789,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,The people’s indignation and revenge!
3790,THE SHIPWRECK OF IDOMENEUS,"Vain the last childlike pleading voice for life,"

4161,TO A NIGHTINGALE,O NIGHTINGALE! how hast thou learnt
4162,TO A NIGHTINGALE,The note of the nested dove?
4163,TO A NIGHTINGALE,While under thy bower the fern hangs burnt
4164,TO A NIGHTINGALE,And no cloud hovers above!
4165,TO A NIGHTINGALE,Rich July has many a sky
4166,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"With splendour dim, that thou mightst hymn,"
4167,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"And make rejoice with thy wondrous voice,"
4168,TO A NIGHTINGALE,And the thrill of thy wild pervading tone!
4169,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"But instead of to woo, thou hast learnt to coo:"
4170,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"Thy song is mute at the mellowing fruit,"
4171,TO A NIGHTINGALE,And the dirge of the flowers is sung by the hours
4172,TO A NIGHTINGALE,In silence and twilight alone.
4173,TO A NIGHTINGALE,
4174,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"O nightingale! ’tis this, ’tis this"
4175,TO A NIGHTINGALE,That makes thee mock the dove!
4176,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"That thou hast past thy marriage bliss,"
4177,TO A NIGHTINGALE,To know a parent’s love.
4178,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"The waves of fern may fade and burn,"
4179,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"The grasses may fall, the flowers and all,"
4180,TO A NIGHTINGALE,And the pine-smells o’er the oak dells
4181,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"Float on their drowsy and odorous wings,"
4182,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"But thou wilt do nothing but coo,"
4183,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"Brimming the nest with thy brooding breast,"
4184,TO A NIGHTINGALE,"’Midst that young throng of future song,"
4185,TO A NIGHTINGALE,Round whom the Future sings!

4613,VIII,You danced bright as a bit o’ the sun.
4614,VIII,Birds in a May-bush we were! right merry!
4615,VIII,"All night we kiss’d, we juggled all day."

5093,XIV,"And have called themselves sinners, hate chaps to beg."
5094,XIV,I’ll wager they’ll all of ’em dine to-day!

6091,XXVI,"For Mary had sunk, and her body was shaking, as if in a fit."
6092,XXVI,"Tom’s letter she held, and her thumb-nail the month when the letter"
6093,XXVI,was writ
6094,XXVI,"Fast-dinted, while she hung sobbing: ‘O, see, Sir, the letter is old!"
6095,XXVI,"O, do not be too happy!’—‘If I understand you, I’m bowled!’"
6096,XXVI,"Said Grandfather Bridgeman, ‘and down go my wickets!—not happy! when"

6098,XXVI,Here’s Tom like to marry his General’s daughter—or widow—I’ll swear!

6107,XXVII,"Will ask him to Buckingham Palace, to say what he’s done and he’s"
6108,XXVII,seen.
6109,XXVII,Victoria’s fond of her soldiers: and she’s got a nose for a fight.
6110,XXVII,If Tom tells a cleverish story—there is such a thing as a knight!
6111,XXVII,And don’t he look roguish and handsome!—To see a girl snivelling
6112,XXVII,there—
6113,XXVII,"By George, Miss, it’s clear that you’re jealous’—‘I love him!’ she"
6114,XXVII,answered his stare.

6123,XXVIII,"‘And “now”’s just a bit too late, so it’s no use your piping your"

6125,XXVIII,The farmer added bluffly: ‘Old Lawyer Charlworth was rich;
6126,XXVIII,You followed his instructions in kicking Tom into the ditch.
6127,XXVIII,"If you’re such a dutiful daughter, that doesn’t prove Tom is a fool."

6137,XXIX,prevailed!
6138,XXIX,My heart has so bled for you!’  The old man burst on her speech:
6139,XXIX,"‘You’ve chosen a likely time, Miss! a pretty occasion to preach!’"
6140,XXIX,"And was it not outrageous, that now, of all times, one should come"
6141,XXIX,With incomprehensible pity!  Far better had Mary been dumb.

6165,XXXI,"The family pride of the Bridgemans was comforted; still, with"

6167,XXXI,They looked on a monied damsel of modesty quite so exempt.
6168,XXXI,"‘O give me force to tell them!’ cried Mary, and even as she spoke,"
6169,XXXI,A shout and a hush of the children: a vision on all of them broke.

6178,XXXII,The ghost of Tom drawn slow o’er the orchard’s shadowy green.
6179,XXXII,Could this be the martial darling they joyed in a moment ago?
6180,XXXII,"‘He knows it?’ to Mary Tom murmured, and closed his weak lids at her"
6181,XXXII,‘No.’
6182,XXXII,"‘Beloved!’ she said, falling by him, ‘I have been a coward: I thought"

6194,XXXIII,The letter brought by your comrade—he has but just read it aloud!

6196,XXXIII,bowed.

6272,I,BY this he knew she wept with waking eyes:
6273,I,"That, at his hand’s light quiver by her head,"
6274,I,The strange low sobs that shook their common bed
6275,I,"Were called into her with a sharp surprise,"
6276,I,"And strangled mute, like little gaping snakes,"
6277,I,Dreadfully venomous to him.  She lay
6278,I,"Stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away"
6279,I,"With muffled pulses.  Then, as midnight makes"
6280,I,Her giant heart of Memory and Tears
6281,I,"Drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat"
6282,I,"Sleep’s heavy measure, they from head to feet"
6283,I,"Were moveless, looking through their dead black years,"
6284,I,By vain regret scrawled over the blank wall.

6297,II,"Each sucked a secret, and each wore a mask."
6298,II,"But, oh, the bitter taste her beauty had!"
6299,II,He sickened as at breath of poison-flowers:
6300,II,"A languid humour stole among the hours,"
6301,II,"And if their smiles encountered, he went mad,"
6302,II,"And raged deep inward, till the light was brown"
6303,II,"Before his vision, and the world, forgot,"
6304,II,Looked wicked as some old dull murder-spot.
6305,II,"A star with lurid beams, she seemed to crown"
6306,II,The pit of infamy: and then again

6365,V,"Familiar was her shoulder in the glass,"
6366,V,Through that dark rain: yet it may come to pass
6367,V,That a changed eye finds such familiar sights
6368,V,More keenly tempting than new loveliness.
6369,V,The ‘What has been’ a moment seemed his own:

6391,VI,The love is here; it has but changed its aim.

6407,VII,How deftly that oiled barber lays his bloom!
6408,VII,That long-shanked dapper Cupid with frisked curls
6409,VII,Can make known women torturingly fair;

6411,VII,Awakes beneath his magic whisks and twirls.

6413,VII,Until I see with eyes of other men;
6414,VII,"While deeper knowledge crouches in its den,"
6415,VII,And sends a spark up:—is it true we are wed?
6416,VII,"Yea! filthiness of body is most vile,"
6417,VII,But faithlessness of heart I do hold worse.
6418,VII,"The former, it were not so great a curse"

6429,VIII,Where came the cleft between us? whose the fault?
6430,VIII,"My tears are on thee, that have rarely dropped"
6431,VIII,As balm for any bitter wound of mine:
6432,VIII,My breast will open for thee at a sign!
6433,VIII,"But, no: we are two reed-pipes, coarsely stopped:"
6434,VIII,The God once filled them with his mellow breath;
6435,VIII,"And they were music till he flung them down,"
6436,VIII,Used! used!  Hear now the discord-loving clown
6437,VIII,"Puff his gross spirit in them, worse than death!"
6438,VIII,I do not know myself without thee more:
6439,VIII,In this unholy battle I grow base:

6450,IX,To see the helpless delicate thing receive
6451,IX,His guardianship through certain dark defiles.
6452,IX,"Had he not teeth to rend, and hunger too?"
6453,IX,But still he spared her.  Once: ‘Have you no fear?’
6454,IX,He said: ’twas dusk; she in his grasp; none near.
6455,IX,"She laughed: ‘No, surely; am I not with you?’"
6456,IX,"And uttering that soft starry ‘you,’ she leaned"
6457,IX,"Her gentle body near him, looking up;"
6458,IX,"And from her eyes, as from a poison-cup,"
6459,IX,He drank until the flittering eyelids screened.
6460,IX,"Devilish malignant witch! and oh, young beam"
6461,IX,Of heaven’s circle-glory!  Here thy shape

6473,X,Drag on Love’s nerveless body thro’ all time?
6474,X,"I must have slept, since now I wake.  Prepare,"
6475,X,"You lovers, to know Love a thing of moods:"
6476,X,"Not, like hard life, of laws.  In Love’s deep woods,"
6477,X,I dreamt of loyal Life:—the offence is there!
6478,X,Love’s jealous woods about the sun are curled;
6479,X,"At least, the sun far brighter there did beam.—"
6480,X,"My crime is, that the puppet of a dream,"
6481,X,I plotted to be worthy of the world.
6482,X,"Oh, had I with my darling helped to mince"

6525,XII,"If the mad Past, on which my foot is based,"
6526,XII,"Were firm, or might be blotted: but the whole"

6539,XIII,"And lo, she wins, and of her harmonies"
6540,XIII,She is full sure!  Upon her dying rose
6541,XIII,"She drops a look of fondness, and goes by,"
6542,XIII,Scarce any retrospection in her eye;
6543,XIII,"For she the laws of growth most deeply knows,"
6544,XIII,"Whose hands bear, here, a seed-bag—there, an urn."
6545,XIII,"Pledged she herself to aught, ’twould mark her end!"
6546,XIII,This lesson of our only visible friend
6547,XIII,Can we not teach our foolish hearts to learn?
6548,XIII,"Yes! yes!—but, oh, our human rose is fair"
6549,XIII,"Surpassingly!  Lose calmly Love’s great bliss,"
6550,XIII,When the renewed for ever of a kiss
6551,XIII,Whirls life within the shower of loosened hair!

6558,XIV,What soul would bargain for a cure that brings
6559,XIV,Contempt the nobler agony to kill?
6560,XIV,"Rather let me bear on the bitter ill,"
6561,XIV,And strike this rusty bosom with new stings!
6562,XIV,"It seems there is another veering fit,"
6563,XIV,Since on a gold-haired lady’s eyeballs pure
6564,XIV,"I looked with little prospect of a cure,"
6565,XIV,The while her mouth’s red bow loosed shafts of wit.
6566,XIV,Just heaven! can it be true that jealousy
6567,XIV,Has decked the woman thus? and does her head
6568,XIV,Swim somewhat for possessions forfeited?
6569,XIV,"Madam, you teach me many things that be."
6570,XIV,"I open an old book, and there I find"
6571,XIV,That ‘Women still may love whom they deceive.’
6572,XIV,"Such love I prize not, madam: by your leave,"
6573,XIV,The game you play at is not to my mind.

6580,XV,"I think she sleeps: it must be sleep, when low"
6581,XV,Hangs that abandoned arm toward the floor;
6582,XV,The face turned with it.  Now make fast the door.
6583,XV,"Sleep on: it is your husband, not your foe."
6584,XV,The Poet’s black stage-lion of wronged love
6585,XV,Frights not our modern dames:—well if he did!
6586,XV,"Now will I pour new light upon that lid,"
6587,XV,"Full-sloping like the breasts beneath.  ‘Sweet dove,"
6588,XV,"Your sleep is pure.  Nay, pardon: I disturb."
6589,XV,I do not? good!’  Her waking infant-stare
6590,XV,Grows woman to the burden my hands bear:
6591,XV,Her own handwriting to me when no curb
6592,XV,Was left on Passion’s tongue.  She trembles through;
6593,XV,A woman’s tremble—the whole instrument:—
6594,XV,I show another letter lately sent.
6595,XV,The words are very like: the name is new.

6602,XVI,"In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour,"
6603,XVI,"When in the firelight steadily aglow,"
6604,XVI,"Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow"
6605,XVI,Among the clicking coals.  Our library-bower
6606,XVI,That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat
6607,XVI,As lovers to whom Time is whispering.
6608,XVI,From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:
6609,XVI,The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.
6610,XVI,Well knew we that Life’s greatest treasure lay
6611,XVI,"With us, and of it was our talk.  ‘Ah, yes!"
6612,XVI,Love dies!’ I said: I never thought it less.
6613,XVI,She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.
6614,XVI,"Then when the fire domed blackening, I found"
6615,XVI,"Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift"
6616,XVI,Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift:—
6617,XVI,Now am I haunted by that taste! that sound!

6625,XVII,Went the feast ever cheerfuller?  She keeps
6626,XVII,The Topic over intellectual deeps
6627,XVII,In buoyancy afloat.  They see no ghost.
6628,XVII,With sparkling surface-eyes we ply the ball:
6629,XVII,It is in truth a most contagious game:
6630,XVII,"HIDING THE SKELETON, shall be its name."
6631,XVII,Such play as this the devils might appal!
6632,XVII,"But here’s the greater wonder; in that we,"
6633,XVII,"Enamoured of an acting nought can tire,"
6634,XVII,"Each other, like true hypocrites, admire;"
6635,XVII,"Warm-lighted looks, Love’s ephemerioe,"
6636,XVII,Shoot gaily o’er the dishes and the wine.
6637,XVII,We waken envy of our happy lot.
6638,XVII,"Fast, sweet, and golden, shows the marriage-knot."
6639,XVII,"Dear guests, you now have seen Love’s corpse-light shine."

6646,XVIII,Here Jack and Tom are paired with Moll and Meg.
6647,XVIII,Curved open to the river-reach is seen
6648,XVIII,A country merry-making on the green.
6649,XVIII,Fair space for signal shakings of the leg.
6650,XVIII,"That little screwy fiddler from his booth,"
6651,XVIII,"Whence flows one nut-brown stream, commands the joints"
6652,XVIII,Of all who caper here at various points.
6653,XVIII,I have known rustic revels in my youth:
6654,XVIII,The May-fly pleasures of a mind at ease.
6655,XVIII,An early goddess was a country lass:
6656,XVIII,A charmed Amphion-oak she tripped the grass.
6657,XVIII,What life was that I lived?  The life of these?
6658,XVIII,Heaven keep them happy!  Nature they seem near.
6659,XVIII,"They must, I think, be wiser than I am;"
6660,XVIII,They have the secret of the bull and lamb.

6669,XIX,Of some few favoured men I would put claim.
6670,XIX,"I bleed, but her who wounds I will not blame."
6671,XIX,Have I not felt her heart as ’twere my own
6672,XIX,Beat thro’ me? could I hurt her? heaven and hell!
6673,XIX,But I could hurt her cruelly!  Can I let
6674,XIX,"My Love’s old time-piece to another set,"
6675,XIX,"Swear it can’t stop, and must for ever swell?"
6676,XIX,"Sure, that’s one way Love drifts into the mart"
6677,XIX,Where goat-legged buyers throng.  I see not plain:—
6678,XIX,"My meaning is, it must not be again."
6679,XIX,Great God! the maddest gambler throws his heart.
6680,XIX,"If any state be enviable on earth,"
6681,XIX,"’Tis yon born idiot’s, who, as days go by,"
6682,XIX,"Still rubs his hands before him, like a fly,"

6693,XX,Of all my deeds.  The wind that fills my sails
6694,XX,"Propels; but I am helmsman.  Am I wrecked,"
6695,XX,I know the devil has sufficient weight
6696,XX,"To bear: I lay it not on him, or fate."
6697,XX,"Besides, he’s damned.  That man I do suspect"
6698,XX,"A coward, who would burden the poor deuce"
6699,XX,With what ensues from his own slipperiness.
6700,XX,I have just found a wanton-scented tress
6701,XX,"In an old desk, dusty for lack of use."
6702,XX,"Of days and nights it is demonstrative,"
6703,XX,"That, like some aged star, gleam luridly."

6712,XXI,We three are on the cedar-shadowed lawn;
6713,XXI,My friend being third.  He who at love once laughed
6714,XXI,Is in the weak rib by a fatal shaft
6715,XXI,"Struck through, and tells his passion’s bashful dawn"
6716,XXI,"And radiant culmination, glorious crown,"
6717,XXI,When ‘this’ she said: went ‘thus’: most wondrous she.
6718,XXI,"Our eyes grow white, encountering: that we are three,"
6719,XXI,Forgetful; then together we look down.
6720,XXI,But he demands our blessing; is convinced
6721,XXI,That words of wedded lovers must bring good.
6722,XXI,We question; if we dare! or if we should!
6723,XXI,"And pat him, with light laugh.  We have not winced."
6724,XXI,"Next, she has fallen.  Fainting points the sign"
6725,XXI,"To happy things in wedlock.  When she wakes,"
6726,XXI,She looks the star that thro’ the cedar shakes:
6727,XXI,Her lost moist hand clings mortally to mine.

6734,XXII,What may the woman labour to confess?
6735,XXII,There is about her mouth a nervous twitch.
6736,XXII,"’Tis something to be told, or hidden:—which?"
6737,XXII,I get a glimpse of hell in this mild guess.
6738,XXII,"She has desires of touch, as if to feel"
6739,XXII,That all the household things are things she knew.
6740,XXII,She stops before the glass.  What sight in view?
6741,XXII,A face that seems the latest to reveal!
6742,XXII,"For she turns from it hastily, and tossed"
6743,XXII,Irresolute steals shadow-like to where
6744,XXII,"I stand; and wavering pale before me there,"
6745,XXII,Her tears fall still as oak-leaves after frost.
6746,XXII,She will not speak.  I will not ask.  We are
6747,XXII,League-sundered by the silent gulf between.
6748,XXII,"You burly lovers on the village green,"
6749,XXII,"Yours is a lower, and a happier star!"

6756,XXIII,"’Tis Christmas weather, and a country house"
6757,XXIII,Receives us: rooms are full: we can but get
6758,XXIII,An attic-crib.  Such lovers will not fret
6759,XXIII,"At that, it is half-said.  The great carouse"
6760,XXIII,"Knocks hard upon the midnight’s hollow door,"
6761,XXIII,"But when I knock at hers, I see the pit."
6762,XXIII,Why did I come here in that dullard fit?
6763,XXIII,"I enter, and lie couched upon the floor."
6764,XXIII,"Passing, I caught the coverlet’s quick beat:—"
6765,XXIII,"Come, Shame, burn to my soul! and Pride, and Pain—"
6766,XXIII,"Foul demons that have tortured me, enchain!"
6767,XXIII,Out in the freezing darkness the lambs bleat.
6768,XXIII,The small bird stiffens in the low starlight.
6769,XXIII,"I know not how, but shuddering as I slept,"
6770,XXIII,I dreamed a banished angel to me crept:
6771,XXIII,My feet were nourished on her breasts all night.

6779,XXIV,"To know her flesh so pure, so keen her sense,"
6780,XXIV,"That she does penance now for no offence,"
6781,XXIV,Save against Love.  The less can I forgive!
6782,XXIV,"The less can I forgive, though I adore"
6783,XXIV,That cruel lovely pallor which surrounds
6784,XXIV,Her footsteps; and the low vibrating sounds
6785,XXIV,"That come on me, as from a magic shore."
6786,XXIV,"Low are they, but most subtle to find out"
6787,XXIV,"The shrinking soul.  Madam, ’tis understood"
6788,XXIV,"When women play upon their womanhood,"
6789,XXIV,"It means, a Season gone.  And yet I doubt"
6790,XXIV,But I am duped.  That nun-like look waylays
6791,XXIV,My fancy.  Oh!  I do but wait a sign!
6792,XXIV,Pluck out the eyes of pride! thy mouth to mine!
6793,XXIV,Never! though I die thirsting.  Go thy ways!

6801,XXV,You think it quite unnatural.  Let us see.
6802,XXV,"The actors are, it seems, the usual three:"
6803,XXV,"Husband, and wife, and lover.  She—but fie!"
6804,XXV,"In England we’ll not hear of it.  Edmond,"
6805,XXV,"The lover, her devout chagrin doth share;"
6806,XXV,"Blanc-mange and absinthe are his penitent fare,"
6807,XXV,Till his pale aspect makes her over-fond:
6808,XXV,"So, to preclude fresh sin, he tries rosbif."
6809,XXV,Meantime the husband is no more abused:
6810,XXV,Auguste forgives her ere the tear is used.
6811,XXV,Then hangeth all on one tremendous IF:—
6812,XXV,_If_ she will choose between them.  She does choose;
6813,XXV,"And takes her husband, like a proper wife."
6814,XXV,"Unnatural?  My dear, these things are life:"
6815,XXV,"And life, some think, is worthy of the Muse."

6822,XXVI,"Love ere he bleeds, an eagle in high skies,"
6823,XXVI,Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened eve
6824,XXVI,He views the rosy dawn.  In vain they weave
6825,XXVI,The fatal web below while far he flies.
6826,XXVI,"But when the arrow strikes him, there’s a change."
6827,XXVI,"He moves but in the track of his spent pain,"
6828,XXVI,"Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain,"
6829,XXVI,"Binding him to the ground, with narrow range."
6830,XXVI,A subtle serpent then has Love become.
6831,XXVI,I had the eagle in my bosom erst:
6832,XXVI,Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.
6833,XXVI,I can interpret where the mouth is dumb.
6834,XXVI,"Speak, and I see the side-lie of a truth."
6835,XXVI,Perchance my heart may pardon you this deed:
6836,XXVI,"But be no coward:—you that made Love bleed,"
6837,XXVI,You must bear all the venom of his tooth!

6846,XXVII,Doctor! that same specific yesterday
6847,XXVII,"I tried, and the result will not deter"
6848,XXVII,A second trial.  Is the devil’s line
6849,XXVII,"Of golden hair, or raven black, composed?"
6850,XXVII,"And does a cheek, like any sea-shell rosed,"
6851,XXVII,"Or clear as widowed sky, seem most divine?"
6852,XXVII,"No matter, so I taste forgetfulness."
6853,XXVII,"And if the devil snare me, body and mind,"
6854,XXVII,"Here gratefully I score:—he seemëd kind,"
6855,XXVII,When not a soul would comfort my distress!
6856,XXVII,"O sweet new world, in which I rise new made!"
6857,XXVII,"O Lady, once I gave love: now I take!"
6858,XXVII,"Lady, I must be flattered.  Shouldst thou wake"

6867,XXVIII,"Desire speaks out.  Lady, I am content"
6868,XXVIII,"To play with you the game of Sentiment,"
6869,XXVIII,And with you enter on paths perilous;
6870,XXVIII,"But if across your beauty I throw light,"
6871,XXVIII,"To make it threefold, it must be all mine."
6872,XXVIII,First secret; then avowed.  For I must shine
6873,XXVIII,"Envied,—I, lessened in my proper sight!"
6874,XXVIII,"Be watchful of your beauty, Lady dear!"
6875,XXVIII,How much hangs on that lamp you cannot tell.
6876,XXVIII,"Most earnestly I pray you, tend it well:"
6877,XXVIII,And men shall see me as a burning sphere;
6878,XXVIII,"And men shall mark you eyeing me, and groan"
6879,XXVIII,To be the God of such a grand sunflower!
6880,XXVIII,"I feel the promptings of Satanic power,"

6890,XXIX,"Glory she wears, but springing from the mould;"
6891,XXIX,Not like the consecration of the Past!
6892,XXIX,Is my soul beggared?  Something more than earth
6893,XXIX,I cry for still: I cannot be at peace
6894,XXIX,In having Love upon a mortal lease.
6895,XXIX,I cannot take the woman at her worth!
6896,XXIX,Where is the ancient wealth wherewith I clothed
6897,XXIX,"Our human nakedness, and could endow"
6898,XXIX,With spiritual splendour a white brow
6899,XXIX,That else had grinned at me the fact I loathed?
6900,XXIX,A kiss is but a kiss now! and no wave
6901,XXIX,Of a great flood that whirls me to the sea.
6902,XXIX,"But, as you will! we’ll sit contentedly,"

6987,XXXIII,"And does he grow half human, all is right.’"
6988,XXXIII,"This to my Lady in a distant spot,"
6989,XXXIII,"Upon the theme: _While mind is mastering clay_,"
6990,XXXIII,"_Gross clay invades it_.  If the spy you play,"
6991,XXXIII,"My wife, read this!  Strange love talk, is it not?"

6999,XXXIV,The Deluge or else Fire!  She’s well; she thanks
7000,XXXIV,My husbandship.  Our chain on silence clanks.
7001,XXXIV,"Time leers between, above his twiddling thumbs."
7002,XXXIV,Am I quite well?  Most excellent in health!
7003,XXXIV,"The journals, too, I diligently peruse."
7004,XXXIV,Vesuvius is expected to give news:
7005,XXXIV,Niagara is no noisier.  By stealth
7006,XXXIV,Our eyes dart scrutinizing snakes.  She’s glad
7007,XXXIV,"I’m happy, says her quivering under-lip."
7008,XXXIV,‘And are not you?’  ‘How can I be?’  ‘Take ship!
7009,XXXIV,For happiness is somewhere to be had.’
7010,XXXIV,‘Nowhere for me!’  Her voice is barely heard.
7011,XXXIV,"I am not melted, and make no pretence."
7012,XXXIV,"With commonplace I freeze her, tongue and sense."
7013,XXXIV,Niagara or Vesuvius is deferred.

7022,XXXV,"Deep to her soul, as if the sense had swooned,"
7023,XXXV,And not a thought of vengeance had survived.
7024,XXXV,No confidences has she: but relief
7025,XXXV,Must come to one whose suffering is acute.
7026,XXXV,O have a care of natures that are mute!
7027,XXXV,They punish you in acts: their steps are brief.
7028,XXXV,What is she doing?  What does she demand
7029,XXXV,From Providence or me?  She is not one
7030,XXXV,"Long to endure this torpidly, and shun"
7031,XXXV,The drugs that crowd about a woman’s hand.
7032,XXXV,"At Forfeits during snow we played, and I"
7033,XXXV,Must kiss her.  ‘Well performed!’ I said: then she:

7043,XXXVI,"The charm of women is, that even while"
7044,XXXVI,"You’re probed by them for tears, you yet may smile,"
7045,XXXVI,"Nay, laugh outright, as I have done just now."
7046,XXXVI,The interview was gracious: they anoint
7047,XXXVI,(To me aside) each other with fine praise:
7048,XXXVI,"Discriminating compliments they raise,"
7049,XXXVI,That hit with wondrous aim on the weak point:
7050,XXXVI,My Lady’s nose of Nature might complain.
7051,XXXVI,It is not fashioned aptly to express
7052,XXXVI,Her character of large-browed steadfastness.
7053,XXXVI,But Madam says: Thereof she may be vain!
7054,XXXVI,"Now, Madam’s faulty feature is a glazed"
7055,XXXVI,"And inaccessible eye, that has soft fires,"
7056,XXXVI,"Wide gates, at love-time, only.  This admires"
7057,XXXVI,My Lady.  At the two I stand amazed.

7065,XXXVII,A purple valley (lighted at its edge
7066,XXXVII,By smoky torch-flame on the long cloud-ledge
7067,XXXVII,"Whereunder dropped the chariot) glimmers rich,"
7068,XXXVII,"A quiet company we pace, and wait"
7069,XXXVII,The dinner-bell in prae-digestive calm.
7070,XXXVII,So sweet up violet banks the Southern balm
7071,XXXVII,"Breathes round, we care not if the bell be late:"
7072,XXXVII,Though here and there grey seniors question Time
7073,XXXVII,In irritable coughings.  With slow foot
7074,XXXVII,"The low rosed moon, the face of Music mute,"
7075,XXXVII,Begins among her silent bars to climb.
7076,XXXVII,"As in and out, in silvery dusk, we thread,"
7077,XXXVII,"I hear the laugh of Madam, and discern"
7078,XXXVII,My Lady’s heel before me at each turn.

7089,XXXVIII,Imagination urging appetite!
7090,XXXVIII,"Thus fallen have earth’s greatest Gogmagogs,"
7091,XXXVIII,"Who dazzle us, whom we can not revere:"
7092,XXXVIII,Imagination is the charioteer
7093,XXXVIII,"That, in default of better, drives the hogs."
7094,XXXVIII,"So, therefore, my dear Lady, let me love!"
7095,XXXVIII,My soul is arrowy to the light in you.
7096,XXXVIII,You know me that I never can renew
7097,XXXVIII,The bond that woman broke: what would you have?
7098,XXXVIII,"’Tis Love, or Vileness! not a choice between,"
7099,XXXVIII,Save petrifaction!  What does Pity here?
7100,XXXVIII,"She killed a thing, and now it’s dead, ’tis dear."

7109,XXXIX,"Has yielded: she, my golden-crownëd rose!"
7110,XXXIX,The bride of every sense! more sweet than those
7111,XXXIX,Who breathe the violet breath of maidenhood.
7112,XXXIX,O visage of still music in the sky!
7113,XXXIX,"Soft moon!  I feel thy song, my fairest friend!"
7114,XXXIX,True harmony within can apprehend
7115,XXXIX,Dumb harmony without.  And hark! ’tis nigh!
7116,XXXIX,Belief has struck the note of sound: a gleam
7117,XXXIX,Of living silver shows me where she shook
7118,XXXIX,"Her long white fingers down the shadowy brook,"
7119,XXXIX,"That sings her song, half waking, half in dream."
7120,XXXIX,What two come here to mar this heavenly tune?
7121,XXXIX,"A man is one: the woman bears my name,"
7122,XXXIX,And honour.  Their hands touch!  Am I still tame?

7131,XL,"Know I my meaning, I?  Can I love one,"
7132,XL,And yet be jealous of another?  None
7133,XL,"Commits such folly.  Terrible Love, I ween,"
7134,XL,"Has might, even dead, half sighing to upheave"
7135,XL,The lightless seas of selfishness amain:
7136,XL,Seas that in a man’s heart have no rain
7137,XL,"To fall and still them.  Peace can I achieve,"
7138,XL,"By turning to this fountain-source of woe,"
7139,XL,"This woman, who’s to Love as fire to wood?"
7140,XL,She breathed the violet breath of maidenhood
7141,XL,"Against my kisses once! but I say, No!"
7142,XL,"The thing is mocked at!  Helplessly afloat,"
7143,XL,"I know not what I do, whereto I strive."
7144,XL,The dread that my old love may be alive
7145,XL,Has seized my nursling new love by the throat.

7153,XLI,When others pick it up becomes a gem!
7154,XLI,We grasp at all the wealth it is to them;
7155,XLI,And by reflected light its worth is found.
7156,XLI,Yet for us still ’tis nothing! and that zeal
7157,XLI,Of false appreciation quickly fades.
7158,XLI,"This truth is little known to human shades,"
7159,XLI,How rare from their own instinct ’tis to feel!
7160,XLI,"They waste the soul with spurious desire,"
7161,XLI,That is not the ripe flame upon the bough.
7162,XLI,We two have taken up a lifeless vow
7163,XLI,To rob a living passion: dust for fire!
7164,XLI,"Madam is grave, and eyes the clock that tells"
7165,XLI,Approaching midnight.  We have struck despair
7166,XLI,"Into two hearts.  O, look we like a pair"

7176,XLII,"They think that dignity of soul may come,"
7177,XLII,"Perchance, with dignity of body.  Base!"
7178,XLII,But I was taken by that air of cold
7179,XLII,"And statuesque sedateness, when she said"
7180,XLII,"‘I’m going’; lit a taper, bowed her head,"
7181,XLII,"And went, as with the stride of Pallas bold."
7182,XLII,Fleshly indifference horrible!  The hands
7183,XLII,"Of Time now signal: O, she’s safe from me!"
7184,XLII,Within those secret walls what do I see?
7185,XLII,Where first she set the taper down she stands:
7186,XLII,Not Pallas: Hebe shamed!  Thoughts black as death
7187,XLII,Like a stirred pool in sunshine break.  Her wrists
7188,XLII,"I catch: she faltering, as she half resists,"
7189,XLII,‘You love . . .? love . . .? love . . .?’ all on an indrawn breath.

7197,XLIII,Its skeleton shadow on the broad-backed wave!
7198,XLIII,Here is a fitting spot to dig Love’s grave;
7199,XLIII,"Here where the ponderous breakers plunge and strike,"
7200,XLIII,And dart their hissing tongues high up the sand:
7201,XLIII,"In hearing of the ocean, and in sight"
7202,XLIII,Of those ribbed wind-streaks running into white.
7203,XLIII,"If I the death of Love had deeply planned,"
7204,XLIII,"I never could have made it half so sure,"
7205,XLIII,As by the unblest kisses which upbraid
7206,XLIII,"The full-waked sense; or failing that, degrade!"
7207,XLIII,’Tis morning: but no morning can restore
7208,XLIII,What we have forfeited.  I see no sin:
7209,XLIII,"The wrong is mixed.  In tragic life, God wot,"
7210,XLIII,No villain need be!  Passions spin the plot:
7211,XLIII,We are betrayed by what is false within.

7219,XLIV,A porter at the rosy temple’s gate.
7220,XLIV,I missed him going: but it is my fate
7221,XLIV,To come upon him now beside his wells;
7222,XLIV,"Whereby I know that I Love’s temple leave,"
7223,XLIV,And that the purple doors have closed behind.
7224,XLIV,"Poor soul! if, in those early days unkind,"
7225,XLIV,"Thy power to sting had been but power to grieve,"
7226,XLIV,"We now might with an equal spirit meet,"
7227,XLIV,And not be matched like innocence and vice.
7228,XLIV,"She for the Temple’s worship has paid price,"
7229,XLIV,And takes the coin of Pity as a cheat.
7230,XLIV,She sees through simulation to the bone:
7231,XLIV,What’s best in her impels her to the worst:
7232,XLIV,"Never, she cries, shall Pity soothe Love’s thirst,"

7244,XLV,Mild as an evening heaven round Hesper bright!
7245,XLV,"I pluck the flower, and smell it, and revive"
7246,XLV,The time when in her eyes I stood alive.

7250,XLV,"As I proceed, I feel her sharply stop,"
7251,XLV,And crush it under heel with trembling limbs.
7252,XLV,"She joins me in a cat-like way, and talks"
7253,XLV,"Of company, and even condescends"

7264,XLVI,"About the sounding of the Matin-bell,"
7265,XLVI,"And lo! her place was vacant, and the hum"
7266,XLVI,"Of loneliness was round me.  Then I rose,"
7267,XLVI,And my disordered brain did guide my foot
7268,XLVI,To that old wood where our first love-salute
7269,XLVI,Was interchanged: the source of many throes!
7270,XLVI,"There did I see her, not alone.  I moved"
7271,XLVI,"Toward her, and made proffer of my arm."
7272,XLVI,"She took it simply, with no rude alarm;"
7273,XLVI,And that disturbing shadow passed reproved.

7287,XLVII,Or forward to a summer of bright dye:
7288,XLVII,But in the largeness of the evening earth
7289,XLVII,Our spirits grew as we went side by side.
7290,XLVII,The hour became her husband and my bride.
7291,XLVII,"Love, that had robbed us so, thus blessed our dearth!"
7292,XLVII,The pilgrims of the year waxed very loud
7293,XLVII,"In multitudinous chatterings, as the flood"
7294,XLVII,"Full brown came from the West, and like pale blood"
7295,XLVII,Expanded to the upper crimson cloud.
7296,XLVII,"Love, that had robbed us of immortal things,"
7297,XLVII,"This little moment mercifully gave,"

7310,XLVIII,"Behold!  I looked for peace, and thought it near."
7311,XLVIII,"Our inmost hearts had opened, each to each."
7312,XLVIII,We drank the pure daylight of honest speech.
7313,XLVIII,"Alas! that was the fatal draught, I fear."
7314,XLVIII,"For when of my lost Lady came the word,"
7315,XLVIII,"This woman, O this agony of flesh!"
7316,XLVIII,"Jealous devotion bade her break the mesh,"
7317,XLVIII,That I might seek that other like a bird.
7318,XLVIII,I do adore the nobleness! despise
7319,XLVIII,"The act!  She has gone forth, I know not where."

7418,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,I’ll kiss her with an artful wink.’
7419,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7420,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Fair flash’d the foreign landscape while
7421,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,We breath’d again our native Isle.
7422,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7423,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,‘—The geese may swim hard-by;
7424,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"They gabble, and you talk:"
7425,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,You’re sure there’s not a spy
7426,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,To mark your name with chalk.
7427,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"My heart’s an oak, and it won’t grow"
7428,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"In flower-pots, foreigners must know.’"
7429,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7430,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Pensive he stood: then shook his head
7431,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"Sadly; held out his fist, and said:"
7432,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7433,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,‘—You’ve heard that Hungary’s floor’d?
7434,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,They’ve got her on the ground.
7435,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,A traitor broke her sword:
7436,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Two despots held her bound.
7437,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,I’ve seen her gasping her last hope:
7438,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,I’ve seen her sons strung up b’ the rope.
7439,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7440,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,‘Nine gallant gentlemen
7441,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,In Arad they strung up!
7442,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,I work’d in peace till then:—
7443,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,That poison’d all my cup.
7444,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,A smell of corpses haunted me:
7445,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,My nostril sniff’d like life for sea.
7446,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7447,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,‘Take money for my hire
7448,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,From butchers?—not the man!
7449,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"I’ve got some natural fire,"
7450,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And don’t flash in the pan;—
7451,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,A few ideas I reveal’d:—
7452,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,’Twas well old England stood my shield!
7453,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7454,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"‘Said I, “The Lord of Hosts"
7455,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Have mercy on your land!
7456,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"I see those dangling ghosts,—"
7457,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"And you may keep command,"
7458,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"And hang, and shoot, and have your day:"
7459,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"They hold your bill, and you must pay."
7460,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7461,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"‘“You’ve sent them where they’re strong,"
7462,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,You carrion Double-Head!
7463,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,I hear them sound a gong
7464,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,In Heaven above!”—I said.
7465,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"“My God, what feathers won’t you moult"
7466,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,For this!” says I: and then I bolt.
7467,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7468,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"‘The Bird’s a beastly Bird,"
7469,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"And what is more, a fool."
7470,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,I shake hands with the herd
7471,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,That flock beneath his rule.
7472,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,They’re kindly; and their land is fine.
7473,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,I thought it rarer once than mine.
7474,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7475,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"‘And rare would be its lot,"
7476,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,But that he baulks its powers:
7477,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,It’s just an earthen pot
7478,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,For hearts of oak like ours.
7479,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"Think!  Think!—four days from those frontiers,"
7480,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And I’m a-head full fifty years.
7481,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7482,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"‘It tingles to your scalps,"
7483,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"To think of it, my boys!"
7484,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"Confusion on their Alps,"
7485,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And all their baby toys!
7486,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,The mountains Britain boasts are men:
7487,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"And scale you them, my brethren!’"
7488,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7489,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"Cluck, went his tongue; his fingers, snap."
7490,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Britons were proved all heights to cap.
7491,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7492,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"And we who worshipp’d crags,"
7493,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"Where purple splendours burn’d,"
7494,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"Our idol saw in rags,"
7495,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And right about were turn’d.
7496,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Horizons rich with trembling spires
7497,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,On violet twilights lost their fires.
7498,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7499,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And heights where morning wakes
7500,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,With one cheek over snow;—
7501,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And iron-wallèd lakes
7502,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Where sits the white moon low;—
7503,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"For us on youthful travel bent,"
7504,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,The robing picturesque was rent.
7505,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7506,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Wherever Beauty show’d
7507,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"The wonders of her face,"
7508,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"This man his Jackass rode,"
7509,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,High despot of the place.
7510,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Fair dreams of our enchanted life
7511,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Fled fast from his shrill island fife.
7512,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7513,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And yet we liked him well;
7514,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,We laugh’d with honest hearts:—
7515,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"He shock’d some inner spell,"
7516,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And rous’d discordant parts.
7517,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,We echoed what we half abjured:
7518,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"And hating, smilingly endured."
7519,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7520,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"Moreover, could we be"
7521,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,To our dear land disloyal?
7522,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,And were not also we
7523,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Of History’s blood-Royal?
7524,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,We glow’d to think how donkeys graze
7525,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,"In England, thrilling at their brays."
7526,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,
7527,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,For there a man may view
7528,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,An aspect more sublime
7529,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,Than Alps against the blue:—
7530,THE PATRIOT ENGINEER,The morning eyes of Time!

7913,IV,An hour before the chilly beam:
7914,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7915,IV,The bridegroom started out of a dream:
7916,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7917,IV,
7918,IV,"He went to the door, and there espied:"
7919,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7920,IV,The figure of his silent bride:
7921,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7922,IV,
7923,IV,"He went to the door, and let her in:"
7924,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7925,IV,Whiter looked she than a child of sin:
7926,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7927,IV,
7928,IV,"She looked so white, she looked so sweet:"
7929,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7930,IV,She looked so pure he fell at her feet:
7931,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7932,IV,
7933,IV,He fell at her feet with love and awe:
7934,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7935,IV,A stainless body of light he saw:
7936,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7937,IV,
7938,IV,"O Margaret, say you are not of the dead!"
7939,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7940,IV,My bride! by the angels at night are you led?
7941,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7942,IV,
7943,IV,I am not led by the angels about:
7944,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7945,IV,But I have a devil within to let out:
7946,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7947,IV,
7948,IV,O Margaret! my bride and saint!
7949,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7950,IV,There is on you no earthly taint:
7951,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7952,IV,
7953,IV,"I am no saint, and no bride can I be:"
7954,IV,_Red rose and while in the garden_;
7955,IV,Until I have opened my bosom to thee:
7956,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7957,IV,
7958,IV,To catch at her heart she laid one hand:
7959,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7960,IV,She told the tale where she did stand:
7961,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7962,IV,
7963,IV,She stood before him pale and tall:
7964,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7965,IV,"Her eyes between his, she told him all:"
7966,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7967,IV,
7968,IV,She saw how her body grow freckled and foul:
7969,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7970,IV,She heard from the woods the hooting owl:
7971,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7972,IV,
7973,IV,With never a quiver her mouth did speak:
7974,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7975,IV,O when she had done she stood so meek!
7976,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7977,IV,
7978,IV,The bridegroom stamped and called her vile:
7979,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7980,IV,He did but waken a little smile:
7981,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7982,IV,
7983,IV,The bridegroom raged and called her foul:
7984,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7985,IV,She heard from the woods the hooting owl:
7986,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7987,IV,
7988,IV,He muttered a name full bitter and sore:
7989,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7990,IV,She fell in a lump on the still dead floor:
7991,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7992,IV,
7993,IV,"O great was the wonder, and loud the wail:"
7994,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
7995,IV,When through the household flew the tale:
7996,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
7997,IV,
7998,IV,The old grey mother she dressed the bier:
7999,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
8000,IV,With a shivering chin and never a tear:
8001,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
8002,IV,
8003,IV,"O had you but done as I bade you, my child!"
8004,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
8005,IV,You would not have died and been reviled:
8006,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
8007,IV,
8008,IV,The bridegroom he hung at midnight by the bier:
8009,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
8010,IV,He eyed the white girl thro’ a dazzling tear:
8011,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.
8012,IV,
8013,IV,O had you been false as the women who stray:
8014,IV,_Red rose and white in the garden_;
8015,IV,You would not be now with the Angels of Day!
8016,IV,_And the bird sings over the roses_.

8111,SHEMSELNIHAR,"How I shuddered—I knew not that I was a slave,"
8112,SHEMSELNIHAR,Till I looked on thy face:—then I writhed in the net.
8113,SHEMSELNIHAR,"Then I felt like a thing caught by fire, that her star"

8318,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8319,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,But heard I a low swell that noised
8320,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Of far-off ocean, I was ’ware"

8327,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"And Peace, as in the hearts of saints"
8328,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Who chant unto the Lord their God;
8329,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Deep Peace below upon the muffled sod,"
8330,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"The stillness of the sea’s unswaying floor,"

8336,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"The Golden Harp is struck once more,"
8337,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,And all its music is for me!
8338,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Pour, let the wines of Heaven pour!"
8339,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"And, ho, for a night of Pagan glee!"
8340,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8341,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,There is a curtain o’er us.
8342,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"For once, good souls, we’ll not pretend"
8343,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"To be aught better than her who bore us,"
8344,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,And is our only visible friend.
8345,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Hark to her laughter! who laughs like this,"
8346,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Can she be dead, or rooted in pain?"
8347,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"She has been slain by the narrow brain,"

8349,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Can she die?  O, take her kiss!"
8350,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8351,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"The crimson-footed nymph is panting up the glade,"
8352,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"With the wine-jar at her arm-pit, and the drunken ivy-braid"

8355,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Hear the crushing of the leaves: hear the cracking of the bough!
8356,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"And the whistling of the bramble, the piping of the weed!"
8357,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8358,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,But the bull-voiced oak is battling now:
8359,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"The storm has seized him half-asleep,"
8360,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,And round him the wild woodland throngs

8373,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,The nymphs of the woodland are gathering there.
8374,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"They huddle the leaves, and trample, and toss;"
8375,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"They swing in the branches, they roll in the moss,"
8376,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,They blow the seed on the air.
8377,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Back to back they stand and blow
8378,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"The winged seed on the cradling air,"
8379,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,A fountain of leaves over bosom and back.
8380,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8381,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,The pipe of the Faun comes on their track
8382,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,And the weltering alleys overflow

8384,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,The riotous companies melt to a pair.
8385,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Bless them, mother of kindness!"
8386,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8387,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,A star has nodded through

8389,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Time only to plant the light
8390,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Of a memory in the blindness.

8394,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"With the onward-hurrying stream,"
8395,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Whose pressure is darkness to me;
8396,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Behind the curtain, fixed,"
8397,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Beams with endless beam
8398,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,That star on the changing sea.
8399,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8400,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Great Mother Nature! teach me, like thee,"
8401,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,To kiss the season and shun regrets.
8402,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"And am I more than the mother who bore,"

8404,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Teach me to blot regrets,"
8405,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Great Mother! me inspire
8406,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,With faith that forward sets
8407,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"But feeds the living fire,"
8408,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Faith that never frets
8409,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,For vagueness in the form.
8410,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"In life, O keep me warm!"
8411,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"For, what is human grief?"

8415,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Fixed am I and await the dark to-be
8416,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"And O, green bounteous Earth!"
8417,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,Bacchante Mother! stern to those

8419,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Death shall I shrink from, loving thee?"
8420,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"Into the breast that gives the rose,"

8436,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8437,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,She knows not loss:

8441,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,
8442,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,And may not men to this attain?
8443,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,"That the joy of motion, the rapture of being,"

8451,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,She smells regeneration
8452,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,In the moist breath of decay.
8453,ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF EARTH IN AUTUMN,

8487,I,I might just as well never have cobbled a shoe!
8488,I,I can’t understand it.  She talks like a song;

8501,II,His heart!—where’s the leg of the poor little maid!
8502,II,"Well, that’s not enough; they must push her downstairs,"
8503,II,To make her go crooked: but why count the list?
8504,II,If it’s right to suppose that our human affairs

8556,VI,Irreligious I’m not; but I look on this sphere
8557,VI,As a place where a man should just think like a man.
8558,VI,"It isn’t fair dealing!  But, contrariwise,"

8571,VII,It’s the very same lesson we get from the Book.
8572,VII,"Then, is Life but a trial?  Is that what is meant?"
8573,VII,"Some must toil, and some perish, for others below:"
