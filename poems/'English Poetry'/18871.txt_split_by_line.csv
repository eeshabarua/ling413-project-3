231,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,1855
232,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,
233,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,
234,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Forth from Calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn"
235,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"shone,"
236,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun
237,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,was gone:
238,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim"
239,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,sweet hour
240,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a"
241,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,field in flower.
242,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the
243,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,starbright air
244,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea,"
245,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,more fair.
246,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,
247,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Whence came change? Was the sweet night weary of rest? What anguish
248,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,awoke in the dark?
249,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as"
250,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,hounds that bark.
251,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings"
252,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"exalt the sky,"
253,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to
254,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,quicken and lighten and die.
255,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in
256,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,music and semblance in fire:
257,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the"
258,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,night's desire.
259,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,
260,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from
261,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,toils cast free:
262,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the
263,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,soul of the sea.
264,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"All the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death"
265,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,for fraught:
266,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or
267,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,things distraught.
268,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on
269,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,the wind:
270,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm
271,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,in the heart of Ind.
272,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the"
273,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"far fierce East,"
274,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar"
275,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,with death for priest.
276,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man
277,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,born free
278,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and
279,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,the wrath of a tropic sea.
280,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"As a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from"
281,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"a backward fall,"
282,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"The strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a"
283,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,sheer cliff's wall.
284,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a"
285,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"breath,"
286,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the
287,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,throat of death.
288,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal"
289,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"joy,"
290,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's
291,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,heart in a boy.
292,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and
293,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"flamed, sublime"
294,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the
295,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,pulse of time.
296,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"The glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light"
297,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"overheard,"
298,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"The rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the"
299,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"fire of a word,"
300,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"In the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of"
301,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"the sea,"
302,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but
303,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,when heaven breathed free.
304,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out"
305,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,into light
306,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that
307,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,were flowerlike and white.
308,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that
309,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,laugh as they fade
310,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,From the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in
311,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,the light they made.
312,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous"
313,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"tune,"
314,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast"
315,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,smile of the moon.
316,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams
317,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"may behold, and deep"
318,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the"
319,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,soul through sleep.
320,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it
321,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,yearns to know
322,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above"
323,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,and below.
324,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"The joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong"
325,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"sea's labour and rage,"
326,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the
327,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,soul to wage.
328,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths
329,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"that the night made bare,"
330,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of"
331,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,air--
332,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its
333,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"reign and the sea's,"
334,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that"
335,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,bows men's knees.
336,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in
337,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,dreams
338,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love"
339,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,for a breath's length seems--
340,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"One utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with"
341,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,love that subsides
342,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and"
343,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,released the tides.
344,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering,"
345,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,assailed and withheld
346,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"As a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is"
347,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,thwarted and quelled.
348,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,As the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a
349,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,boundless lawn
350,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a
351,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,light like dawn.
352,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"A thousand Phosphors, a thousand Hespers, awoke in the churning"
353,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"sea,"
354,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a
355,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,tune could be;
356,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of
357,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"life or of sleep,"
358,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep:"
359,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember"
360,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,awake:
361,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs"
362,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"in the live storm's wake,"
363,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"In the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of"
364,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"the labouring hour,"
365,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"A harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a"
366,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,star-shaped flower.
367,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of
368,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,tempest seemed
369,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"When the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as"
370,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,a dream half dreamed.
371,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"The glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a"
372,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"miracle, died,"
373,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"Not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power"
374,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,and of pride;
375,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"With strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of"
376,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"power upon earth,"
377,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"As a God that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a"
378,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"new God's birth,"
379,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,The might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness
380,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,fell:
381,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of
382,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,heaven and of hell.
383,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"The waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were"
384,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"wellnigh fain,"
385,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"For the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in"
386,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,"labour, to cease from her pain."
387,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad
388,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,loud strife;
389,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the
390,A CHANNEL PASSAGE,passage of life.

396,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,
397,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,
398,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"The sun is lord and god, sublime, serene,"
399,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,And sovereign on the mountains: earth and air
400,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Lie prone in passion, blind with bliss unseen"
401,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"By force of sight and might of rapture, fair"
402,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,As dreams that die and know not what they were.
403,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"The lawns, the gorges, and the peaks, are one"
404,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Glad glory, thrilled with sense of unison"
405,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,In strong compulsive silence of the sun.
406,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,
407,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Flowers dense and keen as midnight stars aflame
408,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,And living things of light like flames in flower
409,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,That glance and flash as though no hand might tame
410,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Lightnings whose life outshone their stormlit hour
411,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"And played and laughed on earth, with all their power"
412,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Gone, and with all their joy of life made long"
413,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"And harmless as the lightning life of song,"
414,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Shine sweet like stars when darkness feels them strong.
415,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,
416,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,The deep mild purple flaked with moonbright gold
417,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"That makes the scales seem flowers of hardened light,"
418,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"The flamelike tongue, the feet that noon leaves cold,"
419,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"The kindly trust in man, when once the sight"
420,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Grew less than strange, and faith bade fear take flight,"
421,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Outlive the little harmless life that shone
422,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"And gladdened eyes that loved it, and was gone"
423,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Ere love might fear that fear had looked thereon.
424,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,
425,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Fear held the bright thing hateful, even as fear,"
426,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Whose name is one with hate and horror, saith"
427,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"That heaven, the dark deep heaven of water near,"
428,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Is deadly deep as hell and dark as death.
429,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,The rapturous plunge that quickens blood and breath
430,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"With pause more sweet than passion, ere they strive"
431,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,To raise again the limbs that yet would dive
432,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Deeper, should there have slain the soul alive."
433,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,
434,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,As the bright salamander in fire of the noonshine exults and is
435,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"glad of his day,"
436,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,The spirit that quickens my body rejoices to pass from the sunlight
437,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"away,"
438,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"To pass from the glow of the mountainous flowerage, the high"
439,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"multitudinous bloom,"
440,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Far down through the fathomless night of the water, the gladness of"
441,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,silence and gloom.
442,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Death-dark and delicious as death in the dream of a lover and
443,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"dreamer may be,"
444,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,It clasps and encompasses body and soul with delight to be living
445,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,and free:
446,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Free utterly now, though the freedom endure but the space of a"
447,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"perilous breath,"
448,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"And living, though girdled about with the darkness and coldness and"
449,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,strangeness of death:
450,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Each limb and each pulse of the body rejoicing, each nerve of the"
451,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"spirit at rest,"
452,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"All sense of the soul's life rapture, a passionate peace in its"
453,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,blindness blest.
454,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"So plunges the downward swimmer, embraced of the water unfathomed"
455,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"of man,"
456,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"The darkness unplummeted, icier than seas in midwinter, for"
457,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,blessing or ban;
458,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"And swiftly and sweetly, when strength and breath fall short, and"
459,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"the dive is done,"
460,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Shoots up as a shaft from the dark depth shot, sped straight into"
461,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,sight of the sun;
462,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"And sheer through the snow-soft water, more dark than the roof of"
463,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"the pines above,"
464,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Strikes forth, and is glad as a bird whose flight is impelled and"
465,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,sustained of love.
466,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,As a sea-mew's love of the sea-wind breasted and ridden for
467,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,rapture's sake
468,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Is the love of his body and soul for the darkling delight of the
469,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,soundless lake:
470,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,As the silent speed of a dream too living to live for a thought's
471,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,space more
472,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Is the flight of his limbs through the still strong chill of the
473,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,darkness from shore to shore.
474,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Might life be as this is and death be as life that casts off time
475,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"as a robe,"
476,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,The likeness of infinite heaven were a symbol revealed of the lake
477,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,of Gaube.
478,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,
479,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Whose thought has fathomed and measured
480,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"The darkness of life and of death,"
481,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"The secret within them treasured,"
482,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,The spirit that is not breath?
483,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Whose vision has yet beholden
484,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,The splendour of death and of life?
485,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Though sunset as dawn be golden,"
486,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Is the word of them peace, not strife?"
487,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,Deep silence answers: the glory
488,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"We dream of may be but a dream,"
489,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,And the sun of the soul wax hoary
490,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,As ashes that show not a gleam.
491,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,But well shall it be with us ever
492,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"Who drive through the darkness here,"
493,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"If the soul that we live by never,"
494,THE LAKE OF GAUBE,"For aught that a lie saith, fear."

523,I,I
524,I,
525,I,"Dawn is alive in the world, and the darkness of heaven and of earth"
526,I,Subsides in the light of a smile more sweet than the loud noon's
527,I,"mirth,"
528,I,"Spring lives as a babe lives, glad and divine as the sun, and"
529,I,unsure
530,I,If aught so divine and so glad may be worshipped and loved and
531,I,endure.
532,I,"A soft green glory suffuses the love-lit earth with delight,"
533,I,And the face of the noon is fair as the face of the star-clothed
534,I,night.
535,I,Earth knows not and doubts not at heart of the glories again to be:
536,I,Sleep doubts not and dreams not how sweet shall the waking beyond
537,I,her be.
538,I,"A whole white world of revival awaits May's whisper awhile,"
539,I,Abides and exults in the bud as a soft hushed laugh in a smile.
540,I,As a maid's mouth laughing with love and subdued for the love's
541,I,"sake, May"
542,I,Shines and withholds for a little the word she revives to say.
543,I,
544,I,When the clouds and the winds and the sunbeams are warring and
545,I,"strengthening with joy that they live,"
546,I,"Spring, from reluctance enkindled to rapture, from slumber to"
547,I,"strife,"
548,I,"Stirs, and repents, and is winter, and weeps, and awakes as the"
549,I,"frosts forgive,"
550,I,"And the dark chill death of the woodland is troubled, and dies"
551,I,into life.
552,I,"And the honey of heaven, of the hives whence night feeds full on"
553,I,"the springtide's breath,"
554,I,Fills fuller the lips of the lustrous air with delight in the
555,I,dawn:
556,I,Each blossom enkindling with love that is life and subsides with a
557,I,smile into death
558,I,Arises and lightens and sets as a star from her sphere withdrawn.
559,I,"Not sleep, in the rapture of radiant dreams, when sundawn smiles on"
560,I,"the night,"
561,I,Shows earth so sweet with a splendour and fragrance of life that
562,I,is love:
563,I,"Each blade of the glad live grass, each bud that receives or"
564,I,"rejects the light,"
565,I,Salutes and responds to the marvel of Maytime around and above.
566,I,
567,I,"Joy gives thanks for the sight and the savour of heaven, and is"
568,I,humbled
569,I,With awe that exults in thanksgiving: the towers of the flowers
570,I,of the trees
571,I,Shine sweeter than snows that the hand of the season has melted and
572,I,"crumbled,"
573,I,And fair as the foam that is lesser of life than the loveliest of
574,I,these.
575,I,But the sense of a life more lustrous with joy and enkindled of
576,I,glory
577,I,"Than man's was ever or may be, and briefer than joys most brief,"
578,I,"Bids man's heart bend and adore, be the man's head golden or hoary,"
579,I,As it leapt but a breath's time since and saluted the flower and
580,I,the leaf.
581,I,The rapture that springs into love at the sight of the world's
582,I,exultation
583,I,Takes not a sense of rebuke from the sense of triumphant awe:
584,I,But the spirit that quickens the body fulfils it with mute
585,I,"adoration,"
586,I,And the knees would fain bow down as the eyes that rejoiced and
587,I,saw.
588,I,
589,I,
590,II,II
591,II,
592,II,"Fair and sublime as the face of the dawn is the splendour of May,"
593,II,But the sky's and the sea's joy fades not as earth's pride passes
594,II,away.
595,II,Yet hardly the sun's first lightning or laughter of love on the sea
596,II,So humbles the heart into worship that knows not or doubts if it be
597,II,As the first full glory beholden again of the life new-born
598,II,That hails and applauds with inaudible music the season of morn.
599,II,"A day's length since, and it was not: a night's length more, and"
600,II,the sun
601,II,Salutes and enkindles a world of delight as a strange world won.
602,II,A new life answers and thrills to the kiss of the young strong
603,II,"year,"
604,II,"And the glory we see is as music we hear not, and dream that we"
605,II,hear.
606,II,"From blossom to blossom the live tune kindles, from tree to tree,"
607,II,And we know not indeed if we hear not the song of the life we see.
608,II,
609,II,For the first blithe day that beholds it and worships and cherishes
610,II,cannot but sing
611,II,With a louder and lustier delight in the sun and the sunlit earth
612,II,Than the joy of the days that beheld but the soft green dawn of the
613,II,slow faint spring
614,II,"Glad and afraid to be glad, and subdued in a shamefast mirth."
615,II,When the first bright knoll of the woodland world laughs out into
616,II,"fragrant light,"
617,II,The year's heart changes and quickens with sense of delight in
618,II,"desire,"
619,II,And the kindling desire is one with thanksgiving for utter fruition
620,II,"of sight,"
621,II,For sight and for sense of a world that the sun finds meet for
622,II,his lyre.
623,II,Music made of the morning that smites from the chords of the mute
624,II,world song
625,II,"Trembles and quickens and lightens, unfelt, unbeholden, unheard,"
626,II,From blossom on blossom that climbs and exults in the strength of
627,II,"the sun grown strong,"
628,II,And answers the word of the wind of the spring with the sun's own
629,II,word.
630,II,
631,II,"Hard on the skirt of the deep soft copses that spring refashions,"
632,II,Triumphs and towers to the height of the crown of a wildwood tree
633,II,"One royal hawthorn, sublime and serene as the joy that impassions"
634,II,"Awe that exults in thanksgiving for sight of the grace we see,"
635,II,"The grace that is given of a god that abides for a season,"
636,II,mysterious
637,II,"And merciful, fervent and fugitive, seen and unknown and adored:"
638,II,"His presence is felt in the light and the fragrance, elate and"
639,II,"imperious,"
640,II,"His laugh and his breath in the blossom are love's, the beloved"
641,II,soul's lord.
642,II,For surely the soul if it loves is beloved of the god as a lover
643,II,"Whose love is not all unaccepted, a worship not utterly vain:"
644,II,"So full, so deep is the joy that revives for the soul to recover"
645,II,"Yearly, beholden of hope and of memory in sunshine and rain."
646,II,
647,II,
648,III,III
649,III,
650,III,"Wonder and love stand silent, stricken at heart and stilled."
651,III,But yet is the cup of delight and of worship unpledged and
652,III,unfilled.
653,III,"A handsbreadth hence leaps up, laughs out as an angel crowned,"
654,III,A strong full fountain of flowers overflowing above and around.
655,III,The boughs and the blossoms in triumph salute with adoring mirth
656,III,"The womb that bare them, the glad green mother, the sunbright"
657,III,earth.
658,III,"Downward sweeping, as song subsides into silence, none"
659,III,May hear what sound is the word's they speak to the brooding sun.
660,III,"None that hearken may hear: man may but pass and adore,"
661,III,And humble his heart in thanksgiving for joy that is now no more.
662,III,"And sudden, afront and ahead of him, joy is alive and aflame"
663,III,"On the shrine whose incense is given of the godhead, again the"
664,III,same.
665,III,
666,III,Pale and pure as a maiden secluded in secret and cherished with
667,III,"fear,"
668,III,"One sweet glad hawthorn smiles as it shrinks under shelter,"
669,III,screened
670,III,"By two strong brethren whose bounteous blossom outsoars it, year"
671,III,"after year,"
672,III,While earth still cleaves to the live spring's breast as a babe
673,III,unweaned.
674,III,"Never was amaranth fairer in fields where heroes of old found rest,"
675,III,"Never was asphodel sweeter: but here they endure not long,"
676,III,Though ever the sight that salutes them again and adores them
677,III,"awhile is blest,"
678,III,"And the heart is a hymn, and the sense is a soul, and the soul is"
679,III,a song.
680,III,"Alone on a dyke's trenched edge, and afar from the blossoming"
681,III,"wildwood's verge,"
682,III,"Laughs and lightens a sister, triumphal in love-lit pride;"
683,III,"Clothed round with the sun, and inviolate: her blossoms exult as"
684,III,"the springtide surge,"
685,III,When the wind and the dawn enkindle the snows of the shoreward
686,III,tide.
687,III,
688,III,Hardly the worship of old that rejoiced as it knelt in the vision
689,III,Shown of the God new-born whose breath is the spirit of spring
690,III,Hailed ever with love more strong and defiant of death's derision
691,III,A joy more perfect than here we mourn for as May takes wing.
692,III,"Time gives it and takes it again and restores it: the glory, the"
693,III,"wonder,"
694,III,The triumph of lustrous blossom that makes of the steep sweet
695,III,bank
696,III,"One visible marvel of music inaudible, over and under,"
697,III,"Attuned as in heaven, pass hence and return for the sun to thank."
698,III,The stars and the sun give thanks for the glory bestowed and
699,III,"beholden,"
700,III,"For the gladness they give and rejoice in, the night and the dawn"
701,III,and the day:
702,III,But nought they behold when the world is aflower and the season is
703,III,golden
704,III,Makes answer as meet and as sweet as the flower that itself is
705,III,May.

766,TO A BABY KINSWOMAN,"What nor faith nor hope may show,"

874,I,"Yet, ere faith, a wandering water, froze and curdled into creeds,"
875,I,"Earth, elate as heaven, adored the light that quickens dreams to"

881,I,of a limitless word.
882,I,And visible: none that hath eyes to behold what the spirit must
883,I,perish or see
884,I,Can choose but behold it and worship: a shrine that if light were

940,I,"sheds upon time,"
941,I,"All radiant and transient and awful and mortal, and leave it"
942,I,unmarred and sublime.
943,I,As the tides that return and recede are the fears and the hopes of
944,I,"the centuries that roll,"
945,I,Requenched and rekindled: but strong as the sun is the sense of it
946,I,shrined in the soul.

948,I,
949,II,II
950,II,
951,II,"In the days when time was not, in the time when days were none,"
952,II,"Ere sorrow had life to lot, ere earth gave thanks for the sun,"
953,II,"Ere man in his darkness waking adored what the soul in him could,"
954,II,"And the manifold God of his making was manifest evil and good,"
955,II,"One law from the dim beginning abode and abides in the end,"
956,II,In sight of him sorrowing and sinning with none but his faith for
957,II,friend.
958,II,"Dark were the shadows around him, and darker the glories above,"
959,II,"Ere light from beyond them found him, and bade him for love's sake"
960,II,love.
961,II,"About him was darkness, and under and over him darkness: the night"
962,II,That conceived him and bore him had thunder for utterance and
963,II,lightning for light.
964,II,The dust of death was the dust of the ways that the tribes of him
965,II,trod:
966,II,And he knew not if just or unjust were the might of the mystery of
967,II,God.
968,II,"Strange horror and hope, strange faith and unfaith, were his boon"
969,II,and his bane:
970,II,And the God of his trust was the wraith of the soul or the ghost of
971,II,it slain.
972,II,"A curse was on death as on birth, and a Presence that shone as a"
973,II,sword
974,II,"Shed menace from heaven upon earth that beheld him, and hailed him"
975,II,her Lord.
976,II,"Sublime and triumphant as fire or as lightning, he kindled the"
977,II,"skies,"
978,II,And withered with dread the desire that would look on the light of
979,II,his eyes.
980,II,"Earth shuddered with worship, and knew not if hell were not hot in"
981,II,her breath;
982,II,"If birth were not sin, and the dew of the morning the sweat of her"
983,II,death.
984,II,The watchwords of evil and good were unspoken of men and unheard:
985,II,"They were shadows that willed as he would, that were made and"
986,II,unmade by his word.
987,II,"His word was darkness and light, and a wisdom that makes men mad"
988,II,"Sent blindness upon them for sight, that they saw but and heard as"
989,II,he bade.
990,II,"Cast forth and corrupt from the birth by the crime of creation,"
991,II,they stood
992,II,Convicted of evil on earth by the grace of a God found good.
993,II,The grace that enkindled and quickened the darkness of hell with
994,II,flame
995,II,"Bade man, though the soul in him sickened, obey, and give praise to"
996,II,his name.
997,II,The still small voice of the spirit whose life is as plague's hot
998,II,breath
999,II,"Bade man shed blood, and inherit the life of the kingdom of death."
1000,II,
1001,II,"""Bring now for blood-offering thy son to mine altar, and bind him"
1002,II,"and slay,"
1003,II,"That the sin of my bidding be done"": and the soul in the slave"
1004,II,"said, ""Yea."""
1005,II,"Yea, not nay, was the word: and the sacrifice offered withal"
1006,II,"Was neither of beast nor of bird, but the soul of a man, God's"
1007,II,thrall.
1008,II,"And the word of his servant spoken was fire, and the light of a"
1009,II,"sword,"
1010,II,"When the bondage of Israel was broken, and Sinai shrank from the"
1011,II,Lord.
1012,II,With splendour of slaughter and thunder of song as the sound of the
1013,II,sea
1014,II,Were the foes of him stricken in sunder and silenced as storms that
1015,II,flee.
1016,II,"Terror and trust and the pride of the chosen, approved of his"
1017,II,"choice,"
1018,II,"Saw God in the whirlwind ride, and rejoiced as the winds rejoice."
1019,II,Subdued and exalted and kindled and quenched by the sense of his
1020,II,"might,"
1021,II,"Faith flamed and exulted and dwindled, and saw not, and clung to"
1022,II,the sight.
1023,II,The wastes of the wilderness brightened and trembled with rapture
1024,II,and dread
1025,II,When the word of him thundered and lightened and spake through the
1026,II,quick and the dead.
1027,II,"The chant of the prophetess, louder and loftier than tempest and"
1028,II,"wave,"
1029,II,"Rang triumph more ruthless and prouder than death, and profound as"
1030,II,the grave.
1031,II,And sweet as the moon's word spoken in smiles that the blown clouds
1032,II,mar
1033,II,The psalmist's witness in token arose as the speech of a star.
1034,II,"Starlight supreme, and the tender desire of the moon, were as one"
1035,II,To rebuke with compassion the splendour and strength of the godlike
1036,II,sun.
1037,II,"God softened and changed: and the word of his chosen, a fire at the"
1038,II,"first,"
1039,II,"Bade man, as a beast or a bird, now slake at the springs his"
1040,II,thirst.
1041,II,The souls that were sealed unto death as the bones of the dead lie
1042,II,sealed
1043,II,Rose thrilled and redeemed by the breath of the dawn on the
1044,II,flame-lit field.
1045,II,"The glories of darkness, cloven with music of thunder, shrank"
1046,II,"As the web of the word was unwoven that spake, and the soul's tide"
1047,II,sank.
1048,II,And the starshine of midnight that covered Arabia with light as a
1049,II,robe
1050,II,Waxed fiery with utterance that hovered and flamed through the
1051,II,whirlwind on Job.
1052,II,"And prophet to prophet and vision to vision made answer sublime,"
1053,II,Till the valley of doom and decision was merged in the tides of
1054,II,time.
1055,II,
1056,II,
1057,III,III
1058,III,
1059,III,"Then, soft as the dews of night,"
1060,III,"As the star of the sundawn bright,"
1061,III,"As the heart of the sea's hymn deep,"
1062,III,"And sweet as the balm of sleep,"
1063,III,Arose on the world a light
1064,III,Too pure for the skies to keep.
1065,III,
1066,III,With music sweeter and stranger than heaven had heard
1067,III,When the dark east thrilled with light from a saviour's word
1068,III,And a God grew man to endure as a man and abide
1069,III,"The doom of the will of the Lord of the loud world's tide,"
1070,III,"Whom thunders utter, and tempest and darkness hide,"
1071,III,With larger light than flamed from the peak whereon
1072,III,"Prometheus, bound as the sun to the world's wheel, shone,"
1073,III,"A presence passed and abode but on earth a span,"
1074,III,"And love's own light as a river before him ran,"
1075,III,And the name of God for awhile upon earth was man.
1076,III,
1077,III,"O star that wast not and wast for the world a sun,"
1078,III,"O light that was quenched of priests, and its work undone,"
1079,III,"O Word that wast not as man's or as God's, if God"
1080,III,Be Lord but of hosts whose tread was as death's that trod
1081,III,"On souls that felt but his wrath as an unseen rod,"
1082,III,"What word, what praise, what passion of hopeless prayer,"
1083,III,"May now rise up to thee, loud as in years that were,"
1084,III,From years that gaze on the works of thy servants wrought
1085,III,While strength was in them to satiate the lust of thought
1086,III,That craved in thy name for blood as the quest it sought?
1087,III,
1088,III,From the dark high places of Rome
1089,III,Far over the westward foam
1090,III,God's heaven and the sun saw swell
1091,III,"The fires of the high priest's hell,"
1092,III,And shrank as they curled and clomb
1093,III,And revelled and ravaged and fell.
1094,III,
1095,III,
1096,IV,IV
1097,IV,
1098,IV,Yet was not the work of thy word all withered with wasting flame
1099,IV,"By the sons of the priests that had slain thee, whose evil was"
1100,IV,wrought in thy name.
1101,IV,From the blood-sodden soil that was blasted with fires of the
1102,IV,Church and her creed
1103,IV,"Sprang rarely but surely, by grace of thy spirit, a flower for a"
1104,IV,weed.
1105,IV,"Thy spirit, unfelt of thy priests who blasphemed thee, enthralled"
1106,IV,and enticed
1107,IV,To deathward a child that was even as the child we behold in
1108,IV,Christ.
1109,IV,"The Moors, they told her, beyond bright Spain and the strait brief"
1110,IV,"sea,"
1111,IV,"Dwelt blind in the light that for them was as darkness, and knew"
1112,IV,not thee.
1113,IV,"But the blood of the martyrs whose mission was witness for God,"
1114,IV,"they said,"
1115,IV,"Might raise to redemption the souls that were here, in the sun's"
1116,IV,"sight, dead."
1117,IV,"And the child rose up in the night, when the stars were as friends"
1118,IV,"that smiled,"
1119,IV,"And sought her brother, and wakened the younger and tenderer child."
1120,IV,From the heaven of a child's glad sleep to the heaven of the sight
1121,IV,of her eyes
1122,IV,"He woke, and brightened and hearkened, and kindled as stars that"
1123,IV,rise.
1124,IV,"And forth they fared together to die for the stranger's sake,"
1125,IV,"For the souls of the slayers that should slay them, and turn from"
1126,IV,"their sins, and wake."
1127,IV,And the light of the love that lit them awhile on a brief blind
1128,IV,quest
1129,IV,"Shines yet on the tear-lit smile that salutes them, belated and"
1130,IV,blest.
1131,IV,
1132,IV,"And the girl, full-grown to the stature of godhead in womanhood,"
1133,IV,spake
1134,IV,The word that sweetens and lightens her creed for her great love's
1135,IV,sake.
1136,IV,From the godlike heart of Theresa the prayer above all prayers
1137,IV,"heard,"
1138,IV,"The cry as of God made woman, a sweet blind wonderful word,"
1139,IV,"Sprang sudden as flame, and kindled the darkness of faith with"
1140,IV,"love,"
1141,IV,"And the hollow of hell from beneath shone, quickened of heaven from"
1142,IV,above.
1143,IV,"Yea, hell at her word grew heaven, as she prayed that if God"
1144,IV,thought well
1145,IV,"She there might stand in the gateway, that none might pass into"
1146,IV,hell.
1147,IV,"Not Hermes, guardian and guide, God, herald, and comforter, shed"
1148,IV,Such lustre of hope from the life of his light on the night of the
1149,IV,dead.
1150,IV,"Not Pallas, wiser and mightier in mercy than Rome's God shone,"
1151,IV,Wore ever such raiment of love as the soul of a saint put on.
1152,IV,"So blooms as a flower of the darkness a star of the midnight born,"
1153,IV,"Of the midnight's womb and the blackness of darkness, and flames"
1154,IV,like morn.
1155,IV,"Nor yet may the dawn extinguish or hide it, when churches and"
1156,IV,creeds
1157,IV,Are withered and blasted with sunlight as poisonous and blossomless
1158,IV,weeds.
1159,IV,So springs and strives through the soil that the legions of
1160,IV,"darkness have trod,"
1161,IV,"From the root that is man, from the soul in the body, the flower"
1162,IV,that is God.
1163,IV,

1165,V,V
1166,V,
1167,V,Ages and creeds that drift
1168,V,Through change and cloud uplift
1169,V,"The soul that soars and seeks her sovereign shrine,"
1170,V,"Her faith's veiled altar, there"
1171,V,"To find, when praise and prayer"
1172,V,"Fall baffled, if the darkness be divine."
1173,V,Lights change and shift through star and sun:
1174,V,"Night, clothed with might of immemorial years, is one."
1175,V,
1176,V,"Day, born and slain of night,"
1177,V,Hath hardly life in sight
1178,V,"As she that bears and slays him and survives,"
1179,V,And gives us back for one
1180,V,Cloud-thwarted fiery sun
1181,V,The myriad mysteries of the lambent lives
1182,V,Whose starry soundless music saith
1183,V,That light and life wax perfect even through night and death.
1184,V,
1185,V,In vain had darkness heard
1186,V,Light speak the lustrous word
1187,V,That cast out faith in all save truth and love:
1188,V,In vain death's quickening rod
1189,V,"Bade man rise up as God,"
1190,V,Touched as with life unknown in heaven above:
1191,V,Fear turned his light of love to fire
1192,V,"That wasted earth, yet might not slay the soul's desire."
1193,V,
1194,V,"Though death seem life, and night"
1195,V,"Bid fear call darkness light,"
1196,V,"Time, faith, and hope keep trust, through sorrow and shame,"
1197,V,"Till Christ, by Paul cast out,"
1198,V,"Return, and all the rout"
1199,V,Of raging slaves whose prayer defiles his name
1200,V,"Rush headlong to the deep, and die,"
1201,V,And leave no sign to say that faith once heard them lie.
1202,V,
1203,V,
1204,VI,VI
1205,VI,
1206,VI,"Since man, with a child's pride proud, and abashed as a child and"
1207,VI,"afraid,"
1208,VI,"Made God in his likeness, and bowed him to worship the Maker he"
1209,VI,"made,"
1210,VI,No faith more dire hath enticed man's trust than the saint's whose
1211,VI,creed
1212,VI,"Made Caiaphas one with Christ, that worms on the cross might feed."
1213,VI,"Priests gazed upon God in the eyes of a babe new-born, and therein"
1214,VI,"Beheld not heaven, and the wise glad secret of love, but sin."
1215,VI,"Accursed of heaven, and baptized with the baptism of hatred and"
1216,VI,"hell,"
1217,VI,They spat on the name they despised and adored as a sign and a
1218,VI,spell.
1219,VI,"""Lord Christ, thou art God, and a liar: they were children of"
1220,VI,"wrath, not of grace,"
1221,VI,"Unbaptized, unredeemed from the fire they were born for, who smiled"
1222,VI,"in thy face."""
1223,VI,Of such is the kingdom--he said it--of heaven: and the heavenly
1224,VI,word
1225,VI,"Shall live when religion is dead, and when falsehood is dumb shall"
1226,VI,be heard.
1227,VI,And the message of James and of John was as Christ's and as love's
1228,VI,own call:
1229,VI,But wrath passed sentence thereon when Annas replied in Paul.
1230,VI,The dark old God who had slain him grew one with the Christ he
1231,VI,"slew,"
1232,VI,And poison was rank in the grain that with growth of his gospel
1233,VI,grew.
1234,VI,And the blackness of darkness brightened: and red in the heart of
1235,VI,the flame
1236,VI,"Shone down, as a blessing that lightened, the curse of a new God's"
1237,VI,name.
1238,VI,Through centuries of burning and trembling belief as a signal it
1239,VI,"shone,"
1240,VI,"Till man, soul-sick of dissembling, bade fear and her frauds"
1241,VI,begone.
1242,VI,"God Cerberus yelps from his throats triune: but his day, which was"
1243,VI,"night,"
1244,VI,"Is quenched, with its stars and the notes of its night-birds, in"
1245,VI,silence and light.
1246,VI,The flames of its fires and the psalms of their psalmists are
1247,VI,darkened and dumb:
1248,VI,"Strong winter has withered the palms of his angels, and stricken"
1249,VI,them numb.
1250,VI,"God, father of lies, God, son of perdition, God, spirit of ill,"
1251,VI,Thy will that for ages was done is undone as a dead God's will.
1252,VI,"Not Mahomet's sword could slay thee, nor Borgia's or Calvin's"
1253,VI,praise:
1254,VI,But the scales of the spirit that weigh thee are weighted with
1255,VI,"truth, and it slays."
1256,VI,"The song of the day of thy fury, when nature and death shall quail,"
1257,VI,"Rings now as the thunders of Jewry, the ghost of a dead world's"
1258,VI,tale.
1259,VI,"That day and its doom foreseen and foreshadowed on earth, when"
1260,VI,"thou,"
1261,VI,"Lord God, wast lord of the keen dark season, are sport for us now."
1262,VI,Thy claws were clipped and thy fangs plucked out by the hands that
1263,VI,slew
1264,VI,"Men, lovers of man, whose pangs bore witness if truth were true."
1265,VI,Man crucified rose again from the sepulchre builded to be
1266,VI,"No grave for the souls of the men who denied thee, but, Lord, for"
1267,VI,thee.
1268,VI,
1269,VI,"When Bruno's spirit aspired from the flames that thy servants fed,"
1270,VI,The spirit of faith was fired to consume thee and leave thee dead.
1271,VI,When the light of the sunlike eyes whence laughter lightened and
1272,VI,flamed
1273,VI,"Bade France and the world be wise, faith saw thee naked and shamed."
1274,VI,When wisdom deeper and sweeter than Rabelais veiled and revealed
1275,VI,Found utterance diviner and meeter for truth whence anguish is
1276,VI,"healed,"
1277,VI,"Whence fear and hate and belief in thee, fed by thy grace from"
1278,VI,"above,"
1279,VI,"Fall stricken, and utmost grief takes light from the lustre of"
1280,VI,"love,"
1281,VI,"When Shakespeare shone into birth, and the world he beheld grew"
1282,VI,"bright,"
1283,VI,"Thy kingdom was ended on earth, and the darkness it shed was light."
1284,VI,"In him all truth and the glory thereof and the power and the pride,"
1285,VI,"The song of the soul and her story, bore witness that fear had"
1286,VI,lied.
1287,VI,"All hope, all wonder, all trust, all doubt that knows not of fear,"
1288,VI,"The love of the body, the lust of the spirit to see and to hear,"
1289,VI,"All womanhood, fairer than love could conceive or desire or adore,"
1290,VI,"All manhood, radiant above all heights that it held of yore,"
1291,VI,"Lived by the life of his breath, with the speech of his soul's will"
1292,VI,"spake,"
1293,VI,And the light lit darkness to death whence never the dead shall
1294,VI,wake.
1295,VI,For the light that lived in the sound of the song of his speech was
1296,VI,one
1297,VI,With the light of the wisdom that found earth's tune in the song of
1298,VI,the sun;
1299,VI,"His word with the word of the lord most high of us all on earth,"
1300,VI,"Whose soul was a lyre and a sword, whose death was a deathless"
1301,VI,birth.
1302,VI,Him too we praise as we praise our own who as he stand strong;
1303,VI,"Him, Æschylus, ancient of days, whose word is the perfect song."
1304,VI,When Caucasus showed to the sun and the sea what a God could
1305,VI,"endure,"
1306,VI,"When wisdom and light were one, and the hands of the matricide"
1307,VI,"pure,"
1308,VI,"A song too subtle for psalmist or prophet of Jewry to know,"
1309,VI,"Elate and profound as the calmest or stormiest of waters that flow,"
1310,VI,"A word whose echoes were wonder and music of fears overcome,"
1311,VI,"Bade Sinai bow, and the thunder of godhead on Horeb be dumb."
1312,VI,"The childless children of night, strong daughters of doom and"
1313,VI,"dread,"
1314,VI,"The thoughts and the fears that smite the soul, and its life lies"
1315,VI,"dead,"
1316,VI,Stood still and were quelled by the sound of his word and the light
1317,VI,"of his thought,"
1318,VI,And the God that in man lay bound was unbound from the bonds he had
1319,VI,wrought.
1320,VI,Dark fear of a lord more dark than the dreams of his worshippers
1321,VI,knew
1322,VI,"Fell dead, and the corpse lay stark in the sunlight of truth shown"

1331,VII,"Light is here for souls to see, though the stars of faith be dead:"
1332,VII,All the sea that yearned and trembled receives the sun instead.
1333,VII,"All the shadows on the spirit when fears and dreams were strong,"
1334,VII,"All perdition, all redemption, blind rain-stars watched so long,"

1338,VII,All the names wherein the incarnate Lord lived his day and died
1339,VII,"Fade from suns to stars, from stars into darkness undescried."

1341,VII,"Christ the man lives yet, remembered of man as dreams that leave"
1342,VII,Light on eyes that wake and know not if memory bid them grieve.
1343,VII,"Fire sublime as lightning shines, and exults in thunder yet,"
1344,VII,Where the battle wields the name and the sword of Mahomet.
1345,VII,"Far above all wars and gospels, all ebb and flow of time,"
1346,VII,"Lives the soul that speaks in silence, and makes mute earth"
1347,VII,sublime.

3474,PROLOGUE TO DOCTOR FAUSTUS,"Earth, bright with flowers whose dew shone soft as tears,"

3889,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,He passed: but yet for many a lustrous year
3890,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,His light of song bade England shine and hear.
3891,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"As plague and fire and faith in falsehood spread,"
3892,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"So from the man of men, divine and dead,"
3893,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Contagious godhead, seen, unknown, and heard,"
3894,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Fulfilled and quickened England; thought and word,"
3895,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"When men would fain set life to music, grew"
3896,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,More sweet than years which knew not Shakespeare knew.
3897,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,The simplest soul that set itself to song
3898,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Sang, and may fear not time's or change's wrong."
3899,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,The lightest eye that glanced on life could see
3900,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Through grief and joy the God that man might be.
3901,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,All passion whence the living soul takes fire
3902,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Till death fulfil despair and quench desire,"
3903,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"All love that lightens through the cloud of chance,"
3904,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"All hate that lurks in hope and smites askance,"
3905,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"All holiness of sorrow, all divine"
3906,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Pity, whose tears are stars that save and shine,"
3907,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,All sunbright strength of laughter like the sea's
3908,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"When spring and autumn loose their lustrous breeze,"
3909,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"All sweet, all strange, all sad, all glorious things,"
3910,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Lived on his lips, and hailed him king of kings."
3911,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"All thought, all strife, all anguish, all delight,"
3912,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Spake all he bade, and speak till day be night."
3913,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"No soul that heard, no spirit that beheld,"
3914,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Knew not the God that lured them and compelled.
3915,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,On Beaumont's brow the sun arisen afar
3916,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Shed fire which lit through heaven the younger star
3917,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,That sank before the sunset: one dark spring
3918,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Slew first the kinglike subject, then the king."
3919,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,The glory left above their graves made strong
3920,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"The heart of Fletcher, till the flower-sweet song"
3921,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"That Shakespeare culled from Chaucer's field, and died,"
3922,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Found ending on his lips that smiled and sighed.
3923,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,From Dekker's eyes the light of tear-touched mirth
3924,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Shone as from Shakespeare's, mingling heaven and earth."
3925,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Wild witchcraft's lure and England's love made one
3926,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,With Shakespeare's heart the heart of Middleton.
3927,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Harsh, homely, true, and tragic, Rowley told"
3928,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,His heart's debt down in rough and radiant gold.
3929,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,The skies that Tourneur's lightning clove and rent
3930,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Flamed through the clouds where Shakespeare's thunder went.
3931,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Wise Massinger bade kings be wise in vain
3932,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Ere war bade song, storm-stricken, cower and wane."
3933,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Kind Heywood, simple-souled and single-eyed,"
3934,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Found voice for England's home-born praise and pride.
3935,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Strange grief, strange love, strange terror, bared the sword"
3936,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,That smote the soul by grace and will of Ford.
3937,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,The stern grim strength of Chapman's thought found speech
3938,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Loud as when storm at ebb-tide rends the beach:
3939,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,And all the honey brewed from flowers in May
3940,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Made sweet the lips and bright the dreams of Day.
3941,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,But even as Shakespeare caught from Marlowe's word
3942,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Fire, so from his the thunder-bearing third,"
3943,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Webster, took light and might whence none but he"
3944,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Hath since made song that sounded so the sea
3945,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Whose waves are lives of men--whose tidestream rolls
3946,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,From year to darkening year the freight of souls.
3947,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Alone above it, sweet, supreme, sublime,"
3948,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Shakespeare attunes the jarring chords of time;
3949,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,"Alone of all whose doom is death and birth,"
3950,THE AFTERGLOW OF SHAKESPEARE,Shakespeare is lord of souls alive on earth.
