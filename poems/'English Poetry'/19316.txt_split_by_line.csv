56,PREFACE,PREFACE
57,PREFACE,
58,PREFACE,
59,PREFACE,"This book of verse for boys is, I believe, the first of its"
60,PREFACE,"kind in English. Plainly, it were labour lost to go gleaning"
61,PREFACE,where so many experts have gone harvesting; and for what is
62,PREFACE,"rarest and best in English Poetry the world must turn, as"
63,PREFACE,"heretofore, to the several 'Golden Treasuries' of Professor"
64,PREFACE,"Palgrave and Mr. Coventry Patmore, and to the excellent 'Poets'"
65,PREFACE,Walk' of Mr. Mowbray Morris. My purpose has been to choose and
66,PREFACE,"sheave a certain number of those achievements in verse which,"
67,PREFACE,as expressing the simpler sentiments and the more elemental
68,PREFACE,"emotions, might fitly be addressed to such boys--and men, for"
69,PREFACE,that matter--as are privileged to use our noble English tongue.
70,PREFACE,
71,PREFACE,"To set forth, as only art can, the beauty and the joy of living,"
72,PREFACE,"the beauty and the blessedness of death, the glory of battle"
73,PREFACE,"and adventure, the nobility of devotion--to a cause, an ideal,"
74,PREFACE,"a passion even--the dignity of resistance, the sacred quality"
75,PREFACE,"of patriotism, that is my ambition here.  Now, to read poetry"
76,PREFACE,"at all is to have an ideal anthology of one's own, and in that"
77,PREFACE,possession to be incapable of content with the anthologies of all
78,PREFACE,"the world besides. That is, the personal equation is ever to be"
79,PREFACE,"reckoned withal, and I have had my preferences, as those that"
80,PREFACE,"went before me had theirs.  I have omitted much, as Aytoun's"
81,PREFACE,"'Lays,' whose absence many will resent; I have included much,"
82,PREFACE,"as that brilliant piece of doggerel of Frederick Marryat's,"
83,PREFACE,whose presence some will regard with distress. This without
84,PREFACE,reference to enforcements due to the very nature of my work.
85,PREFACE,
86,PREFACE,I have adopted the birth-day order: for that is the simplest.
87,PREFACE,"And I have begun with--not Chaucer, nor Spenser, nor the ballads,"
88,PREFACE,but--Shakespeare and Agincourt; for it seemed to me that a
89,PREFACE,book of heroism could have no better starting-point than that
90,PREFACE,"heroic pair of names. As for the ballads, I have placed them,"
91,PREFACE,"after much considering, in the gap between old and new, between"
92,PREFACE,"classic and romantic, in English verse. The witness of Sidney and"
93,PREFACE,"Drayton's example notwithstanding, it is not until 1765, when"
94,PREFACE,"Percy publishes the 'Reliques,' that the ballad spirit begins"
95,PREFACE,to be the master influence that Wordsworth confessed it was;
96,PREFACE,"while as for the history of the matter, there are who hold that"
97,PREFACE,"'Sir Patrick Spens,' for example, is the work of Lady Wardlaw,"
98,PREFACE,"which to others, myself among them, is a thing preposterous"
99,PREFACE,and distraught.
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,"It remains to add that, addressing myself to boys, I have not"
102,PREFACE,"scrupled to edit my authors where editing seemed desirable, and"
103,PREFACE,that I have broken up some of the longer pieces for convenience in
104,PREFACE,"reading. Also, the help I have received while this book of 'Noble"
105,PREFACE,"Numbers' was in course of growth--help in the way of counsel,"
106,PREFACE,"suggestion, remonstrance, permission to use--has been such that"
107,PREFACE,it taxes gratitude and makes complete acknowledgment impossible.

1322,LYCIDAS,Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
1323,LYCIDAS,(That last infirmity of noble mind)
1324,LYCIDAS,To scorn delights and live laborious days;
1325,LYCIDAS,"But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,"
1326,LYCIDAS,"And think to burst out into sudden blaze,"
1327,LYCIDAS,"Comes the blind Fury with the abhorrËd shears,"
1328,LYCIDAS,"And slits the thin-spun life. 'But not the praise,'"
1329,LYCIDAS,"Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears:"
1330,LYCIDAS,"'Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,"
1331,LYCIDAS,Nor in the glistering foil
1332,LYCIDAS,"Set off to the world nor in broad rumour lies,"
1333,LYCIDAS,But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
1334,LYCIDAS,And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;
1335,LYCIDAS,"As he pronounces lastly on each deed,"
1336,LYCIDAS,Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.'
1337,LYCIDAS,"O fountain Arethuse, and thou honoured flood,"
1338,LYCIDAS,"Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,"
1339,LYCIDAS,That strain I heard was of a higher mood!
1340,LYCIDAS,"But now my oat proceeds,"
1341,LYCIDAS,And listens to the Herald of the Sea
1342,LYCIDAS,That came in Neptune's plea.
1343,LYCIDAS,"He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,"
1344,LYCIDAS,What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?
1345,LYCIDAS,And questioned every gust of rugged wings
1346,LYCIDAS,That blows from off each beakËd promontory:
1347,LYCIDAS,"They knew not of his story,"
1348,LYCIDAS,"And sage Hippotades their answer brings,"
1349,LYCIDAS,That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed:
1350,LYCIDAS,"The air was calm, and on the level brine"
1351,LYCIDAS,Sleek Panope with all her sisters played.
1352,LYCIDAS,"It was that fatal and perfidious bark,"
1353,LYCIDAS,"Built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark,"
1354,LYCIDAS,That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
1355,LYCIDAS,"Next, Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,"
1356,LYCIDAS,"His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge,"
1357,LYCIDAS,"Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge"
1358,LYCIDAS,Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.
1359,LYCIDAS,"'Ah! who hath reft,' quoth he, 'my dearest pledge?'"
1360,LYCIDAS,"Last came, and last did go,"
1361,LYCIDAS,The Pilot of the Galilean Lake;
1362,LYCIDAS,Two massy keys he bore of metals twain
1363,LYCIDAS,"(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain)."
1364,LYCIDAS,"He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:"
1365,LYCIDAS,"'How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,"
1366,LYCIDAS,Enow of such as for their bellies' sake
1367,LYCIDAS,"Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold!"
1368,LYCIDAS,Of other care they little reckoning make
1369,LYCIDAS,"Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast,"
1370,LYCIDAS,And shove away the worthy bidden guest;
1371,LYCIDAS,Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold
1372,LYCIDAS,"A sheep-hook, or have learnt aught else the least"
1373,LYCIDAS,That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!
1374,LYCIDAS,What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;
1375,LYCIDAS,"And, when they list, their lean and flashy songs"
1376,LYCIDAS,Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;
1377,LYCIDAS,"The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,"
1378,LYCIDAS,"But, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,"
1379,LYCIDAS,"Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:"
1380,LYCIDAS,Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
1381,LYCIDAS,"Daily devours apace, and nothing said:"
1382,LYCIDAS,But that two-handed engine at the door
1383,LYCIDAS,"Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.'"
1384,LYCIDAS,"Return, Alpheus, the dread voice is past"
1385,LYCIDAS,"That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse,"
1386,LYCIDAS,"And call the vales, and bid them hither cast"
1387,LYCIDAS,Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.
1388,LYCIDAS,"Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use"
1389,LYCIDAS,"Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,"
1390,LYCIDAS,On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks;
1391,LYCIDAS,Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes
1392,LYCIDAS,"That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers,"
1393,LYCIDAS,And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
1394,LYCIDAS,"Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,"
1395,LYCIDAS,"The tufted crow-toe and pale jessamine,"
1396,LYCIDAS,"The white pink and the pansy freaked with jet,"
1397,LYCIDAS,"The glowing violet,"
1398,LYCIDAS,"The musk-rose and the well-attired woodbine,"
1399,LYCIDAS,"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,"
1400,LYCIDAS,And every flower that sad embroidery wears:
1401,LYCIDAS,"Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,"
1402,LYCIDAS,"And daffadillies fill their cups with tears,"
1403,LYCIDAS,To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.
1404,LYCIDAS,"For, so to interpose a little ease,"
1405,LYCIDAS,Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise;
1406,LYCIDAS,Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
1407,LYCIDAS,"Wash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled;"
1408,LYCIDAS,"Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,"
1409,LYCIDAS,Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
1410,LYCIDAS,Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;
1411,LYCIDAS,"Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,"
1412,LYCIDAS,"Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,"
1413,LYCIDAS,Where the great vision of the guarded mount
1414,LYCIDAS,Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold;
1415,LYCIDAS,"Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:"
1416,LYCIDAS,"And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth."
1417,LYCIDAS,"Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,"
1418,LYCIDAS,"For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,"
1419,LYCIDAS,Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.
1420,LYCIDAS,"So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,"
1421,LYCIDAS,"And yet anon repairs his drooping head,"
1422,LYCIDAS,"And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore"
1423,LYCIDAS,Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
1424,LYCIDAS,"So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,"
1425,LYCIDAS,"Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,"
1426,LYCIDAS,"Where, other groves and other streams along,"
1427,LYCIDAS,"With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,"
1428,LYCIDAS,"And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,"
1429,LYCIDAS,In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love
1430,LYCIDAS,"There entertain him all the Saints above,"
1431,LYCIDAS,In solemn troops and sweet societies
1432,LYCIDAS,"That sing, and singing in their glory move,"
1433,LYCIDAS,And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
1434,LYCIDAS,"Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;"
1435,LYCIDAS,Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore
1436,LYCIDAS,"In thy large recompense, and shalt be good"
1437,LYCIDAS,To all that wander in that perilous flood.
1438,LYCIDAS,"Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills,"
1439,LYCIDAS,While the still morn went out with sandals grey;
1440,LYCIDAS,"He touched the tender stops of various quills,"
1441,LYCIDAS,With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:
1442,LYCIDAS,"And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,"
1443,LYCIDAS,And now was dropt into the western bay:
1444,LYCIDAS,"At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue;"
1445,LYCIDAS,To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.

1734,TWO KINGS,The forward youth that would appear
1735,TWO KINGS,"Must now forsake his Muses dear,"
1736,TWO KINGS,Nor in the shadows sing
1737,TWO KINGS,His numbers languishing.
1738,TWO KINGS,
1739,TWO KINGS,"'Tis time to leave the books in dust,"
1740,TWO KINGS,"And oil the unusËd armour's rust,"
1741,TWO KINGS,Removing from the wall
1742,TWO KINGS,The corselet of the hall.
1743,TWO KINGS,
1744,TWO KINGS,So restless Cromwell could not cease
1745,TWO KINGS,"In the inglorious arts of peace,"
1746,TWO KINGS,But through adventurous war
1747,TWO KINGS,UrgËd his active star;
1748,TWO KINGS,
1749,TWO KINGS,"And, like the three-forked lightning, first"
1750,TWO KINGS,"Breaking the clouds where it was nurst,"
1751,TWO KINGS,Did thorough his own side
1752,TWO KINGS,His fiery way divide;
1753,TWO KINGS,
1754,TWO KINGS,"For 'tis all one to courage high,"
1755,TWO KINGS,"The emulous or enemy,"
1756,TWO KINGS,And with such to inclose
1757,TWO KINGS,Is more than to oppose;
1758,TWO KINGS,
1759,TWO KINGS,"Then burning through the air he went,"
1760,TWO KINGS,And palaces and temples rent;
1761,TWO KINGS,And CÊsar's head at last
1762,TWO KINGS,Did through his laurels blast.
1763,TWO KINGS,
1764,TWO KINGS,'Tis madness to resist or blame
1765,TWO KINGS,The face of angry Heaven's flame;
1766,TWO KINGS,"And if we would speak true,"
1767,TWO KINGS,"Much to the man is due,"
1768,TWO KINGS,
1769,TWO KINGS,"Who from his private gardens, where"
1770,TWO KINGS,"He lived reservËd and austere,"
1771,TWO KINGS,As if his highest plot
1772,TWO KINGS,"To plant the bergamot,"
1773,TWO KINGS,
1774,TWO KINGS,Could by industrious valour climb
1775,TWO KINGS,"To ruin the great work of Time,"
1776,TWO KINGS,And cast the kingdoms old
1777,TWO KINGS,Into another mould.
1778,TWO KINGS,
1779,TWO KINGS,"Though Justice against Fate complain,"
1780,TWO KINGS,And plead the ancient rights in vain
1781,TWO KINGS,"(But those do hold or break,"
1782,TWO KINGS,"As men are strong or weak),"
1783,TWO KINGS,
1784,TWO KINGS,"Nature, that hated emptiness,"
1785,TWO KINGS,"Allows of penetration less,"
1786,TWO KINGS,And therefore must make room
1787,TWO KINGS,Where greater spirits come.
1788,TWO KINGS,
1789,TWO KINGS,"What field of all the civil war,"
1790,TWO KINGS,Where his were not the deepest scar?
1791,TWO KINGS,And Hampton shows what part
1792,TWO KINGS,"He had of wiser art,"
1793,TWO KINGS,
1794,TWO KINGS,"Where, twining subtile fears with hope,"
1795,TWO KINGS,He wove a net of such a scope
1796,TWO KINGS,That Charles himself might chase
1797,TWO KINGS,"To Carisbrook's narrow case,"
1798,TWO KINGS,
1799,TWO KINGS,That thence the royal actor borne
1800,TWO KINGS,The tragic scaffold might adorn:
1801,TWO KINGS,"While round the armËd bands,"
1802,TWO KINGS,Did clap their bloody hands.
1803,TWO KINGS,
1804,TWO KINGS,He nothing common did or mean
1805,TWO KINGS,"Upon that memorable scene,"
1806,TWO KINGS,But with his keener eye
1807,TWO KINGS,The axe's edge did try;
1808,TWO KINGS,
1809,TWO KINGS,Nor called the gods with vulgar spite
1810,TWO KINGS,"To vindicate his helpless right,"
1811,TWO KINGS,But bowed his comely head
1812,TWO KINGS,"Down, as upon a bed."
1813,TWO KINGS,
1814,TWO KINGS,This was that memorable hour
1815,TWO KINGS,Which first assured the forcËd power:
1816,TWO KINGS,"So, when they did design"
1817,TWO KINGS,"The Capitol's first line,"
1818,TWO KINGS,
1819,TWO KINGS,"A bleeding head, where they begun,"
1820,TWO KINGS,Did fright the architects to run;
1821,TWO KINGS,And yet in that the State
1822,TWO KINGS,Foresaw its happy fate!
1823,TWO KINGS,
1824,TWO KINGS,And now the Irish are ashamed
1825,TWO KINGS,To see themselves in one year tamed:
1826,TWO KINGS,So much one man can do
1827,TWO KINGS,That doth both act and know.
1828,TWO KINGS,
1829,TWO KINGS,"They can affirm his praises best,"
1830,TWO KINGS,"And have, though overcome, confessed"
1831,TWO KINGS,"How good he is, how just,"
1832,TWO KINGS,And fit for highest trust;
1833,TWO KINGS,
1834,TWO KINGS,"Nor yet grown stiffer with command,"
1835,TWO KINGS,But still in the Republic's hand
1836,TWO KINGS,"(How fit he is to sway,"
1837,TWO KINGS,"That can so well obey!),"
1838,TWO KINGS,
1839,TWO KINGS,He to the Commons' feet presents
1840,TWO KINGS,"A kingdom for his first year's rents,"
1841,TWO KINGS,And (what he may) forbears
1842,TWO KINGS,His fame to make it theirs:
1843,TWO KINGS,
1844,TWO KINGS,And has his sword and spoils ungirt
1845,TWO KINGS,To lay them at the public's skirt.
1846,TWO KINGS,So when the falcon high
1847,TWO KINGS,"Falls heavy from the sky,"
1848,TWO KINGS,
1849,TWO KINGS,"She, having killed, no more doth search"
1850,TWO KINGS,"But on the next green bough to perch,"
1851,TWO KINGS,"Where, when he first does lure,"
1852,TWO KINGS,The falconer has her sure.
1853,TWO KINGS,
1854,TWO KINGS,What may not then our isle presume
1855,TWO KINGS,While victory his crest does plume?
1856,TWO KINGS,What may not others fear
1857,TWO KINGS,If thus he crowns each year?
1858,TWO KINGS,
1859,TWO KINGS,"As CÊsar he, ere long, to Gaul,"
1860,TWO KINGS,"To Italy an Hannibal,"
1861,TWO KINGS,And to all states not free
1862,TWO KINGS,Shall climacteric be.
1863,TWO KINGS,
1864,TWO KINGS,The Pict no shelter now shall find
1865,TWO KINGS,"Within his party-coloured mind,"
1866,TWO KINGS,But from this valour sad
1867,TWO KINGS,Shrink underneath the plaid;
1868,TWO KINGS,
1869,TWO KINGS,Happy if in the tufted brake
1870,TWO KINGS,"The English hunter him mistake,"
1871,TWO KINGS,Nor lay his hounds in near
1872,TWO KINGS,The Caledonian deer.
1873,TWO KINGS,
1874,TWO KINGS,"But thou, the war's and fortune's son,"
1875,TWO KINGS,"March indefatigably on,"
1876,TWO KINGS,"And for the last effect,"
1877,TWO KINGS,Still keep the sword erect:
1878,TWO KINGS,
1879,TWO KINGS,Besides the force it has to fright
1880,TWO KINGS,"The spirits of the shady night,"
1881,TWO KINGS,"The same arts that did gain,"
1882,TWO KINGS,A power must it maintain.

1910,IN EXILE,He hangs in shades the orange bright

1944,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,
1945,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,'Twas at the royal feast for Persia won
1946,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,By Philip's warlike son:
1947,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Aloft in awful state
1948,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The godlike hero sate
1949,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,On his imperial throne;
1950,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"His valiant peers were placed around,"
1951,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound
1952,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,(So should desert in arms be crowned);
1953,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The lovely Thais by his side
1954,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Sate like a blooming Eastern bride
1955,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,In flower of youth and beauty's pride.
1956,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Happy, happy, happy pair!"
1957,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"None but the brave,"
1958,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"None but the brave,"
1959,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,None but the brave deserves the fair!
1960,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Timotheus, placed on high"
1961,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Amid the tuneful quire,"
1962,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,With flying fingers touched the lyre:
1963,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The trembling notes ascend the sky
1964,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And heavenly joys inspire.
1965,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The song began from Jove
1966,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Who left his blissful seats above,"
1967,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Such is the power of mighty love!
1968,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,A dragon's fiery form belied the god;
1969,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Sublime on radiant spires he rode
1970,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"When he to fair Olympia pressed,"
1971,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"And while he sought her snowy breast,"
1972,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Then round her slender waist he curled,"
1973,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the world."
1974,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The listening crowd admire the lofty sound;
1975,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,A present deity! they shout around:
1976,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound:
1977,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,With ravished ears
1978,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"The monarch hears,"
1979,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Assumes the god;
1980,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Affects to nod
1981,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And seems to shake the spheres.
1982,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,
1983,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung,"
1984,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:
1985,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The jolly god in triumph comes;
1986,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!"
1987,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Flushed with a purple grace
1988,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,He shows his honest face:
1989,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Now give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes!"
1990,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Bacchus, ever fair and young,"
1991,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Drinking joys did first ordain;
1992,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Bacchus' blessings are a treasure,"
1993,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Drinking is the soldier's pleasure:
1994,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Rich the treasure,"
1995,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Sweet the pleasure,"
1996,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Sweet is pleasure after pain.
1997,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,
1998,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Soothed with the sound the king grew vain;
1999,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Fought all his battles o'er again,"
2000,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain!"
2001,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"The master saw the madness rise,"
2002,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes;"
2003,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And while he heaven and earth defied
2004,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Changed his hand, and checked his pride."
2005,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,He chose a mournful Muse
2006,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Soft pity to infuse:
2007,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"He sung Darius great and good,"
2008,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,By too severe a fate
2009,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,"
2010,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Fallen from his high estate,"
2011,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And weltering in his blood;
2012,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Deserted at his utmost need
2013,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"By those his former bounty fed,"
2014,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,On the bare earth exposed he lies
2015,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,With not a friend to close his eyes.
2016,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"With downcast looks the joyless victor sate,"
2017,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Revolving in his altered soul
2018,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The various turns of Chance below
2019,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"And now and then a sigh he stole,"
2020,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And tears began to flow.
2021,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,
2022,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The mighty master smiled to see
2023,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,That love was in the next degree;
2024,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"'Twas but a kindred-sound to move,"
2025,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,For pity melts the mind to love.
2026,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Softly sweet, in Lydian measures"
2027,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures.
2028,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"War, he sang, is toil and trouble,"
2029,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Honour but an empty bubble;
2030,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Never ending, still beginning,"
2031,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Fighting still, and still destroying;"
2032,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"If the world be worth thy winning,"
2033,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Think, O think, it worth enjoying:"
2034,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Lovely Thais sits beside thee,"
2035,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Take the good the gods provide thee.
2036,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The many rend the skies with loud applause;
2037,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"So love was crowned, but Music won the cause."
2038,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"The prince, unable to conceal his pain,"
2039,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Gazed on the fair
2040,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Who caused his care,"
2041,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"And sighed and looked, sighed and looked,"
2042,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Sighed and looked, and sighed again:"
2043,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"At length, with love and wine at once oppressed,"
2044,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The vanquished victor sunk upon her breast.
2045,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,
2046,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Now strike the golden lyre again:
2047,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"A louder yet, and yet a louder strain!"
2048,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Break his bands of sleep asunder
2049,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder.
2050,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Hark, hark! the horrid sound"
2051,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Has raised up his head;
2052,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"As awaked from the dead,"
2053,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And amazed he stares around.
2054,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries,"
2055,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,See the Furies arise!
2056,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"See the snakes that they rear,"
2057,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"How they hiss in their hair,"
2058,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And the sparkles that flash from their eyes!
2059,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Behold a ghastly band,"
2060,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Each a torch in his hand!
2061,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain"
2062,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And unburied remain
2063,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Inglorious on the plain:
2064,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Give the vengeance due
2065,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,To the valiant crew!
2066,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Behold how they toss their torches on high,"
2067,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,How they point to the Persian abodes
2068,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And glittering temples of their hostile gods.
2069,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The princes applaud with a furious joy:
2070,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And the King seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy;
2071,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Thais led the way
2072,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"To light him to his prey,"
2073,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,And like another Helen fired another Troy!
2074,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,
2075,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Thus long ago,"
2076,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Ere heaving bellows learned to blow,"
2077,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"While organs yet were mute,"
2078,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Timotheus, to his breathing flute"
2079,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"And sounding lyre,"
2080,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Could swell the soul to rage or kindle soft desire.
2081,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"At last divine Cecilia came,"
2082,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Inventress of the vocal frame;
2083,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store
2084,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Enlarged the former narrow bounds,"
2085,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"And added length to solemn sounds,"
2086,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,With Nature's mother-wit and arts unknown before
2087,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,"Let old Timotheus yield the prize,"
2088,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,Or both divide the crown:
2089,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,He raised a mortal to the skies;
2090,ALEXANDER'S FEAST,She drew an angel down.

2170,THE HUNTING,"A vow to God did make,"
2171,THE HUNTING,His pleasure in the Scottish woods
2172,THE HUNTING,"Three summer's days to take,"
2173,THE HUNTING,
2174,THE HUNTING,The chiefest harts in Chevy-Chace
2175,THE HUNTING,To kill and bear away.
2176,THE HUNTING,"These tydings to Erle Douglas came,"
2177,THE HUNTING,In Scotland where he lay:
2178,THE HUNTING,
2179,THE HUNTING,"Who sent Erle Percy present word,"
2180,THE HUNTING,He wold prevent his sport.
2181,THE HUNTING,"The English Erle, not fearing that,"
2182,THE HUNTING,Did to the woods resort
2183,THE HUNTING,
2184,THE HUNTING,"With fifteen hundred bow-men bold,"
2185,THE HUNTING,"All chosen men of might,"
2186,THE HUNTING,Who knew full well in time of neede
2187,THE HUNTING,To ayme their shafts aright.
2188,THE HUNTING,
2189,THE HUNTING,"The gallant greyhounds swiftly ran,"
2190,THE HUNTING,To chase the fallow deere:
2191,THE HUNTING,"On Monday they began to hunt,"
2192,THE HUNTING,Ere daylight did appeare;
2193,THE HUNTING,
2194,THE HUNTING,And long before high noone they had
2195,THE HUNTING,An hundred fat buckes slaine;
2196,THE HUNTING,"Then having dined, the drovyers went"
2197,THE HUNTING,To rouse the deere againe.
2198,THE HUNTING,
2199,THE HUNTING,"The bow-men mustered on the hills,"
2200,THE HUNTING,Well able to endure;
2201,THE HUNTING,"Their backsides all, with special care"
2202,THE HUNTING,That day were guarded sure.
2203,THE HUNTING,
2204,THE HUNTING,"The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,"
2205,THE HUNTING,"The nimble deere to take,"
2206,THE HUNTING,And with their cryes the hills and dales
2207,THE HUNTING,An echo shrill did make.
2208,THE HUNTING,
2209,THE HUNTING,"Lord Percy to the quarry went,"
2210,THE HUNTING,To view the slaughtered deere:
2211,THE HUNTING,"Quoth he, 'Erle Douglas promisËd"
2212,THE HUNTING,"This day to meet me here,"
2213,THE HUNTING,
2214,THE HUNTING,"But if I thought he wold not come,"
2215,THE HUNTING,No longer wold I stay.'
2216,THE HUNTING,"With that, a brave younge gentleman"
2217,THE HUNTING,Thus to the Erle did say:
2218,THE HUNTING,
2219,THE HUNTING,"'Lo, yonder doth Erle Douglas come,"
2220,THE HUNTING,His men in armour bright;
2221,THE HUNTING,Full twenty hundred Scottish speares
2222,THE HUNTING,All marching in our sight;
2223,THE HUNTING,
2224,THE HUNTING,"All men of pleasant Tivydale,"
2225,THE HUNTING,Fast by the river Tweede':
2226,THE HUNTING,"'O, cease your sports,' Erle Percy said,"
2227,THE HUNTING,'And take your bowes with speede;
2228,THE HUNTING,
2229,THE HUNTING,"And now with me, my countrymen,"
2230,THE HUNTING,"Your courage forth advance,"
2231,THE HUNTING,"For there was never champion yet,"
2232,THE HUNTING,"In Scotland or in France,"
2233,THE HUNTING,
2234,THE HUNTING,"That ever did on horsebacke come,"
2235,THE HUNTING,"But if my hap it were,"
2236,THE HUNTING,"I durst encounter man for man,"
2237,THE HUNTING,And with him break a speare.'

2240,THE CHALLENGE,THE CHALLENGE
2241,THE CHALLENGE,
2242,THE CHALLENGE,"Erle Douglas on his milke-white steede,"
2243,THE CHALLENGE,"Most like a baron bold,"
2244,THE CHALLENGE,"Rode foremost of his company,"
2245,THE CHALLENGE,Whose armour shone like gold.
2246,THE CHALLENGE,
2247,THE CHALLENGE,"'Show me,' said he, 'whose men ye be,"
2248,THE CHALLENGE,"That hunt so boldly here,"
2249,THE CHALLENGE,"That, without my consent, do chase"
2250,THE CHALLENGE,And kill my fallow-deere.'
2251,THE CHALLENGE,
2252,THE CHALLENGE,"The first man that did answer make,"
2253,THE CHALLENGE,Was noble Percy he;
2254,THE CHALLENGE,"Who sayd, 'We list not to declare,"
2255,THE CHALLENGE,"Nor shew whose men we be,"
2256,THE CHALLENGE,
2257,THE CHALLENGE,"Yet we will spend our dearest blood,"
2258,THE CHALLENGE,Thy chiefest harts to slay.'
2259,THE CHALLENGE,"Then Douglas swore a solemn oath,"
2260,THE CHALLENGE,And thus in rage did say:
2261,THE CHALLENGE,
2262,THE CHALLENGE,"'Ere thus I will out-bravËd be,"
2263,THE CHALLENGE,One of us two shall dye:
2264,THE CHALLENGE,"I know thee well, an erle thou art;"
2265,THE CHALLENGE,"Lord Percy, so am I."
2266,THE CHALLENGE,
2267,THE CHALLENGE,"But trust me, Percy, pittye it were,"
2268,THE CHALLENGE,And great offence to kill
2269,THE CHALLENGE,"Any of these our guiltlesse men,"
2270,THE CHALLENGE,For they have done no ill.
2271,THE CHALLENGE,
2272,THE CHALLENGE,"Let thou and I the battell trye,"
2273,THE CHALLENGE,And set our men aside.'
2274,THE CHALLENGE,"'Accurst be he,' Erle Percy said,"
2275,THE CHALLENGE,'By whom this is denied.'
2276,THE CHALLENGE,
2277,THE CHALLENGE,"Then stept a gallant squier forth,"
2278,THE CHALLENGE,"Witherington was his name,"
2279,THE CHALLENGE,"Who said, 'I wold not have it told"
2280,THE CHALLENGE,"To Henry our king for shame,"
2281,THE CHALLENGE,
2282,THE CHALLENGE,"That ere my captaine fought on foote,"
2283,THE CHALLENGE,And I stood looking on.

2288,THE CHALLENGE,While I have power to stand:

2293,THE BATTLE,THE BATTLE
2294,THE BATTLE,
2295,THE BATTLE,"Our English archers bent their bowes,"
2296,THE BATTLE,"Their hearts were good and trew,"
2297,THE BATTLE,"At the first flight of arrowes sent,"
2298,THE BATTLE,Full fourscore Scots they slew.
2299,THE BATTLE,
2300,THE BATTLE,"Yet bides Erle Douglas on the bent,"
2301,THE BATTLE,As Chieftain stout and good.
2302,THE BATTLE,"As valiant Captain, all unmoved"
2303,THE BATTLE,The shock he firmly stood.
2304,THE BATTLE,
2305,THE BATTLE,"His host he parted had in three,"
2306,THE BATTLE,"As leader ware and try'd,"
2307,THE BATTLE,And soon his spearmen on their foes
2308,THE BATTLE,Bare down on every side.
2309,THE BATTLE,
2310,THE BATTLE,Throughout the English archery
2311,THE BATTLE,They dealt full many a wound;
2312,THE BATTLE,But still our valiant Englishmen
2313,THE BATTLE,"All firmly kept their ground,"
2314,THE BATTLE,
2315,THE BATTLE,"And, throwing strait their bowes away,"
2316,THE BATTLE,"They grasped their swords so bright,"
2317,THE BATTLE,"And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,"
2318,THE BATTLE,On shields and helmets light.
2319,THE BATTLE,
2320,THE BATTLE,"They closed full fast on every side,"
2321,THE BATTLE,No slackness there was found;
2322,THE BATTLE,And many a gallant gentleman
2323,THE BATTLE,Lay gasping on the ground.
2324,THE BATTLE,
2325,THE BATTLE,"O Christ! it was a griefe to see,"
2326,THE BATTLE,"And likewise for to heare,"
2327,THE BATTLE,"The cries of men lying in their gore,"
2328,THE BATTLE,And scattered here and there!
2329,THE BATTLE,
2330,THE BATTLE,"At last these two stout erles did meet,"
2331,THE BATTLE,Like captaines of great might:
2332,THE BATTLE,"Like lions wode, they laid on lode,"
2333,THE BATTLE,And made a cruel fight:
2334,THE BATTLE,
2335,THE BATTLE,They fought untill they both did sweat
2336,THE BATTLE,With swords of tempered steele;
2337,THE BATTLE,Until the blood like drops of rain
2338,THE BATTLE,They trickling downe did feele.
2339,THE BATTLE,
2340,THE BATTLE,"'Yield thee, Lord Percy,' Douglas said;"
2341,THE BATTLE,"'In faith I will thee bringe,"
2342,THE BATTLE,Where thou shalt high advancËd be
2343,THE BATTLE,By James our Scottish king:
2344,THE BATTLE,
2345,THE BATTLE,"Thy ransome I will freely give,"
2346,THE BATTLE,"And this report of thee,"
2347,THE BATTLE,"Thou art the most courageous knight,"
2348,THE BATTLE,That ever I did see.'
2349,THE BATTLE,
2350,THE BATTLE,"'No, Douglas,' quoth Erle Percy then,"
2351,THE BATTLE,'Thy proffer I do scorne;
2352,THE BATTLE,"I will not yield to any Scot,"
2353,THE BATTLE,That ever yet was borne.'
2354,THE BATTLE,
2355,THE BATTLE,"With that, there came an arrow keene"
2356,THE BATTLE,"Out of an English bow,"
2357,THE BATTLE,"Which struck Erle Douglas to the heart,"
2358,THE BATTLE,A deep and deadly blow:
2359,THE BATTLE,
2360,THE BATTLE,"Who never spake more words than these,"
2361,THE BATTLE,"'Fight on, my merry men all;"
2362,THE BATTLE,"For why, my life is at an end;"
2363,THE BATTLE,Lord Percy sees my fall.'
2364,THE BATTLE,
2365,THE BATTLE,"Then leaving life, Erle Percy tooke"
2366,THE BATTLE,The dead man by the hand;
2367,THE BATTLE,"And said, 'Erle Douglas, for thy life"
2368,THE BATTLE,Wold I had lost my land!
2369,THE BATTLE,
2370,THE BATTLE,O Christ! my very heart doth bleed
2371,THE BATTLE,"With sorrow for thy sake,"
2372,THE BATTLE,"For sure, a more redoubted knight"
2373,THE BATTLE,Mischance could never take.'
2374,THE BATTLE,
2375,THE BATTLE,"A knight amongst the Scots there was,"
2376,THE BATTLE,"Which saw Erle Douglas dye,"
2377,THE BATTLE,Who straight in wrath did vow revenge
2378,THE BATTLE,Upon the Lord Percye.
2379,THE BATTLE,
2380,THE BATTLE,Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he called
2381,THE BATTLE,"Who, with a speare most bright,"
2382,THE BATTLE,"Well-mounted on a gallant steed,"
2383,THE BATTLE,"Ran fiercely through the fight,"
2384,THE BATTLE,
2385,THE BATTLE,"And past the English archers all,"
2386,THE BATTLE,"Without or dread or feare,"
2387,THE BATTLE,And through Erle Percy's body then
2388,THE BATTLE,He thrust his hateful speare.
2389,THE BATTLE,
2390,THE BATTLE,With such a vehement force and might
2391,THE BATTLE,"He did his body gore,"
2392,THE BATTLE,The staff ran through the other side
2393,THE BATTLE,"A large cloth-yard, and more."
2394,THE BATTLE,
2395,THE BATTLE,"So thus did both these nobles dye,"
2396,THE BATTLE,Whose courage none could staine!
2397,THE BATTLE,An English archer then perceived
2398,THE BATTLE,The noble Erle was slaine:
2399,THE BATTLE,
2400,THE BATTLE,"He had a bow bent in his hand,"
2401,THE BATTLE,Made of a trusty tree;
2402,THE BATTLE,An arrow of a cloth-yard long
2403,THE BATTLE,Up to the head drew he;
2404,THE BATTLE,
2405,THE BATTLE,Against Sir Hugh Mountgomerye
2406,THE BATTLE,"So right the shaft he set,"
2407,THE BATTLE,The grey goose-winge that was thereon
2408,THE BATTLE,In his heart's bloode was wet.
2409,THE BATTLE,
2410,THE BATTLE,This fight did last from breake of day
2411,THE BATTLE,Till setting of the sun;
2412,THE BATTLE,"For when they rung the evening-bell,"
2413,THE BATTLE,The battle scarce was done.

2425,THE SLAIN,"Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slaine,"
2426,THE SLAIN,Whose prowesse did surmount.
2427,THE SLAIN,
2428,THE SLAIN,"For Witherington needs must I wayle,"
2429,THE SLAIN,As one in doleful dumpes;
2430,THE SLAIN,"For when his legs were smitten off,"
2431,THE SLAIN,He fought upon his stumpes.
2432,THE SLAIN,
2433,THE SLAIN,"And with Erle Douglas, there was slaine"
2434,THE SLAIN,"Sir Hugh Mountgomerye,"
2435,THE SLAIN,"Sir Charles Murray, that from the field"

2439,THE SLAIN,His sister's sonne was he;
2440,THE SLAIN,"Sir David Lamb, so well esteemed,"
2441,THE SLAIN,Yet saved he could not be;
2442,THE SLAIN,
2443,THE SLAIN,And the Lord Maxwell in like case
2444,THE SLAIN,Did with Erle Douglas dye:
2445,THE SLAIN,"Of twenty hundred Scottish speares,"
2446,THE SLAIN,Scarce fifty-five did flye.
2447,THE SLAIN,
2448,THE SLAIN,"Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,"
2449,THE SLAIN,Went home but fifty-three:
2450,THE SLAIN,"The rest were slaine in Chevy-Chace,"
2451,THE SLAIN,Under the greene woode tree.
2452,THE SLAIN,
2453,THE SLAIN,"Next day did many widdowes come,"
2454,THE SLAIN,Their husbands to bewayle;
2455,THE SLAIN,"They washt their wounds in brinish teares,"
2456,THE SLAIN,But all wold not prevayle;
2457,THE SLAIN,
2458,THE SLAIN,"Their bodyes, bathed in purple gore,"
2459,THE SLAIN,They bore with them away;
2460,THE SLAIN,"They kist them dead a thousand times,"
2461,THE SLAIN,Ere they were clad in clay.

2641,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2642,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"The fifteenth day of July,"
2643,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"With glistering spear and shield,"
2644,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,A famous fight in Flanders
2645,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Was foughten in the field:
2646,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,The most conspicuous officers
2647,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Were English captains three,"
2648,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,But the bravest man in battel
2649,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Was brave Lord Willoughby.
2650,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2651,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"The next was Captain Norris,"
2652,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,A valiant man was he:
2653,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"The other, Captain Turner,"
2654,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,From field would never flee.
2655,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"With fifteen hundred fighting men,"
2656,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Alas! there were no more,"
2657,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,They fought with forty thousand then
2658,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Upon the bloody shore.
2659,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2660,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"'Stand to it, noble pikeman,"
2661,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And look you round about:
2662,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And shoot you right, you bow-men,"
2663,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And we will keep them out:
2664,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"You musquet and cailiver men,"
2665,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Do you prove true to me,"
2666,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"I'll be the bravest man in fight,'"
2667,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Says brave Lord Willoughby.
2668,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2669,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And then the bloody enemy
2670,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"They fiercely did assail,"
2671,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And fought it out most furiously,"
2672,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Not doubting to prevail:
2673,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,The wounded men on both sides fell
2674,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Most piteous for to see,"
2675,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,But nothing could the courage quell
2676,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Of brave Lord Willoughby.
2677,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2678,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,For seven hours to all men's view
2679,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"This fight endurËd sore,"
2680,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Until our men so feeble grew
2681,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,That they could fight no more;
2682,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And then upon dead horses
2683,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Full savourly they eat,"
2684,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And drank the puddle water,"
2685,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,That could no better get.
2686,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2687,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"When they had fed so freely,"
2688,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"They kneelËd on the ground,"
2689,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And praisËd God devoutly
2690,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,For the favour they had found;
2691,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And bearing up their colours,"
2692,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"The fight they did renew,"
2693,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And cutting tow'rds the Spaniard,"
2694,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Five thousand more they slew.
2695,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2696,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,The sharp steel-pointed arrows
2697,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And bullets thick did fly;
2698,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Then did our valiant soldiers
2699,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Charge on most furiously:
2700,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Which made the Spaniards waver,"
2701,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,They thought it best to flee:
2702,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,They feared the stout behaviour
2703,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Of brave Lord Willoughby.
2704,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2705,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Then quoth the Spanish general,"
2706,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"'Come, let us march away,"
2707,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,I fear we shall be spoilËd all
2708,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,If that we longer stay:
2709,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,For yonder comes Lord Willoughby
2710,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"With courage fierce and fell,"
2711,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,He will not give one inch of ground
2712,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,For all the devils in hell.'
2713,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2714,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And when the fearful enemy
2715,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Was quickly put to flight,"
2716,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Our men pursued courageously
2717,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,To rout his forces quite;
2718,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And at last they gave a shout
2719,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Which echoed through the sky:
2720,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"'God, and St. George for England!'"
2721,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,The conquerors did cry.
2722,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2723,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,This news was brought to England
2724,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"With all the speed might be,"
2725,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And soon our gracious Queen was told
2726,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Of this same victory.
2727,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"'O! this is brave Lord Willoughby,"
2728,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,My love that ever won:
2729,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Of all the lords of honour
2730,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,'Tis he great deeds hath done!'
2731,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2732,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"To the soldiers that were maimËd,"
2733,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"And wounded in the fray,"
2734,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,The queen allowed a pension
2735,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Of fifteen pence a day,"
2736,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And from all costs and charges
2737,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,She quit and set them free:
2738,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And this she did all for the sake
2739,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Of brave Lord Willoughby.
2740,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,
2741,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"Then courage, noble Englishmen,"
2742,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And never be dismayed!
2743,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"If that we be but one to ten,"
2744,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,We will not be afraid
2745,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,"To fight with foreign enemies,"
2746,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And set our country free.
2747,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,And thus I end the bloody bout
2748,BRAVE LORD WILLOUGHBY,Of brave Lord Willoughby.

3046,THE RESCUE,
3047,THE RESCUE,Then shoulder high with shout and cry
3048,THE RESCUE,We bore him down the ladder lang;
3049,THE RESCUE,"At every stride Red Rowan made,"

3071,THE RESCUE,
3072,THE RESCUE,"He turned him on the other side,"
3073,THE RESCUE,And at Lord Scroope his glove flung he:
3074,THE RESCUE,"'If ye like na my visit in merrie England,"

3127,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Our stomachs to fulfil!
3128,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,We would play him fair a noble bout
3129,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,With our Angel Gabriel!'
3130,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3131,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,They had no sooner spoken
3132,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,But straight appeared in sight
3133,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Three lusty Spanish vessels
3134,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Of warlike trim and might;
3135,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,With bloody resolution
3136,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"They thought our men to spill,"
3137,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,And they vowed that they would make a prize
3138,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Of our Angel Gabriel.
3139,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3140,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Our gallant ship had in her
3141,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Full forty fighting men:
3142,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,With twenty piece of ordnance
3143,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"We played about them then,"
3144,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"With powder, shot, and bullets"
3145,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"Right well we worked our will,"

3157,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3158,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"We gave them such a broadside,"
3159,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"It smote their mast asunder,"
3160,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"And tore the bowsprit off their ship,"

3162,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"And causËd them in fear to cry,"
3163,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"With voices loud and shrill,"
3164,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"'Help, help, or sunken we shall be"
3165,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,By the Angel Gabriel!'
3166,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3167,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,So desperately they boarded us
3168,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"For all our valiant shot,"
3169,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Threescore of their best fighting men
3170,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Upon our decks were got;
3171,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,And lo! at their first entrances
3172,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"Full thirty did we kill,"
3173,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,And thus we cleared with speed the deck
3174,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Of our Angel Gabriel.
3175,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3176,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,With that their three ships boarded us
3177,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"Again with might and main,"
3178,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,But still our noble Englishmen
3179,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"Cried out, 'A fig for Spain!'"
3180,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Though seven times they boarded us
3181,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"At last we showed our skill,"
3182,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,And made them feel what men we were
3183,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,On the Angel Gabriel.
3184,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3185,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Seven hours this fight continued:
3186,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"So many men lay dead,"
3187,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,With Spanish blood for fathoms round
3188,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,The sea was coloured red.
3189,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Five hundred of their fighting men
3190,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"We there outright did kill,"
3191,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,And many more were hurt and maimed
3192,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,By our Angel Gabriel.
3193,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3194,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"Then, seeing of these bloody spoils,"
3195,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,The rest made haste away:
3196,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"For why, they said, it was no boot"
3197,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,The longer there to stay.
3198,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"Then they fled into CalËs,"
3199,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,Where lie they must and will
3200,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,For fear lest they should meet again
3201,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,With our Angel Gabriel.
3202,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,
3203,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,We had within our English ship
3204,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"But only three men slain,"
3205,THE HONOUR OF BRISTOL,"And five men hurt, the which I hope"

4315,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Where'er his country's foes were found
4316,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Was heard the fated thunder's sound,"
4317,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Till burst the bolt on yonder shore,"
4318,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Rolled, blazed, destroyed,--and was no more."
4319,NELSON: PITT: FOX,
4320,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Nor mourn ye less his perished worth,"
4321,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Who bade the conqueror go forth,"
4322,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And launched that thunderbolt of war
4323,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"On Egypt, Hafnia, Trafalgar;"
4324,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Who, born to guide such high emprise,"
4325,NELSON: PITT: FOX,For Britain's weal was early wise;
4326,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Alas! to whom the Almighty gave,"
4327,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"For Britain's sins, an early grave!"
4328,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"His worth, who in his mightiest hour"
4329,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"A bauble held the pride of power,"
4330,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Spurned at the sordid lust of pelf,"
4331,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And served his Albion for herself;
4332,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Who, when the frantic crowd amain"
4333,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Strained at subjection's bursting rein,"
4334,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"O'er their wild mood full conquest gained,"
4335,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"The pride he would not crush restrained,"
4336,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Showed their fierce zeal a worthier cause,"
4337,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And brought the freeman's arm to aid the freeman's laws.
4338,NELSON: PITT: FOX,
4339,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Hadst thou but lived, though stripped of power,"
4340,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"A watchman on the lonely tower,"
4341,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Thy thrilling trump had roused the land,"
4342,NELSON: PITT: FOX,When fraud or danger were at hand;
4343,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"By thee, as by the beacon-light,"
4344,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Our pilots had kept course aright;
4345,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"As some proud column, though alone,"
4346,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Thy strength had propped the tottering throne
4347,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Now is the stately column broke,"
4348,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"The beacon-light is quenched in smoke,"
4349,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"The trumpet's silver sound is still,"
4350,NELSON: PITT: FOX,The warder silent on the hill!
4351,NELSON: PITT: FOX,
4352,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"O think, how to his latest day,"
4353,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"When death, just hovering, claimed his prey,"
4354,NELSON: PITT: FOX,With Palinure's unaltered mood
4355,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Firm at his dangerous post he stood;
4356,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Each call for needful rest repelled,"
4357,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"With dying hand the rudder held,"
4358,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Till in his fall with fateful sway,"
4359,NELSON: PITT: FOX,The steerage of the realm gave way!
4360,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Then, while on Britain's thousand plains"
4361,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"One unpolluted church remains,"
4362,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Whose peaceful bells ne'er sent around
4363,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"The bloody tocsin's maddening sound,"
4364,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"But still, upon the hallowed day,"
4365,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Convoke the swains to praise and pray;
4366,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"While faith and civil peace are dear,"
4367,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Grace this cold marble with a tear,--"
4368,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"He, who preserved them, PITT, lies here!"
4369,NELSON: PITT: FOX,
4370,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Nor yet suppress the generous sigh,"
4371,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Because his rival slumbers nigh;
4372,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Nor be thy _requiescat_ dumb,"
4373,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Lest it be said o'er FOX's tomb.
4374,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"For talents mourn, untimely lost,"
4375,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"When best employed, and wanted most;"
4376,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Mourn genius high, and lore profound,"
4377,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"And wit that loved to play, not wound;"
4378,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"And all the reasoning powers divine,"
4379,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"To penetrate, resolve, combine;"

4381,NELSON: PITT: FOX,They sleep with him who sleeps below:
4382,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"And, if thou mourn'st they could not save"
4383,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"From error him who owns this grave,"
4384,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Be every harsher thought suppressed,"
4385,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And sacred be the last long rest.
4386,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"_Here_, where the end of earthly things"
4387,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Lays heroes, patriots, bards, and kings;"
4388,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Where stiff the hand, and still the tongue,"
4389,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Of those who fought, and spoke, and sung;"
4390,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"_Here_, where the fretted aisles prolong"
4391,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"The distant notes of holy song,"
4392,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"As if some angel spoke agen,"
4393,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"'All peace on earth, good-will to men';"
4394,NELSON: PITT: FOX,If ever from an English heart
4395,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"O, _here_ let prejudice depart,"
4396,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"And, partial feeling cast aside,"
4397,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Record, that FOX a Briton died!"
4398,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"When Europe crouched to France's yoke,"
4399,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"And Austria bent, and Prussia broke,"
4400,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And the firm Russian's purpose brave
4401,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Was bartered by a timorous slave,"
4402,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Even then dishonour's peace he spurned,"
4403,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"The sullied olive-branch returned,"
4404,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Stood for his country's glory fast,"
4405,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And nailed her colours to the mast!
4406,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Heaven, to reward his firmness, gave"
4407,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"A portion in this honoured grave,"
4408,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And ne'er held marble in its trust
4409,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Of two such wondrous men the dust.
4410,NELSON: PITT: FOX,
4411,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"With more than mortal powers endowed,"
4412,NELSON: PITT: FOX,How high they soared above the crowd!
4413,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Theirs was no common party race,"
4414,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Jostling by dark intrigue for place;
4415,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Like fabled Gods, their mighty war"
4416,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Shook realms and nations in its jar;
4417,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Beneath each banner proud to stand,"
4418,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Looked up the noblest of the land,"
4419,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Till through the British world were known
4420,NELSON: PITT: FOX,The names of PITT and FOX alone.
4421,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Spells of such force no wizard grave
4422,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"E'er framed in dark Thessalian cave,"
4423,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Though his could drain the ocean dry,"
4424,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And force the planets from the sky.
4425,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"These spells are spent, and, spent with these"
4426,NELSON: PITT: FOX,The wine of life is on the lees.
4427,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Genius, and taste, and talent gone,"
4428,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"For ever tombed beneath the stone,"
4429,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Where--taming thought to human pride!--
4430,NELSON: PITT: FOX,The mighty chiefs sleep side by side.
4431,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"Drop upon FOX's grave the tear,"
4432,NELSON: PITT: FOX,'Twill trickle to his rival's bier;
4433,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"O'er PITT's the mournful requiem sound,"
4434,NELSON: PITT: FOX,And FOX's shall the notes rebound.
4435,NELSON: PITT: FOX,"The solemn echo seems to cry,--"
4436,NELSON: PITT: FOX,'Here let their discord with them die.
4437,NELSON: PITT: FOX,Speak not for those a separate doom

4451,LOCHINVAR,
4452,LOCHINVAR,"O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,"
4453,LOCHINVAR,Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
4454,LOCHINVAR,"And save his good broadsword he weapons had none,"
4455,LOCHINVAR,"He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone."
4456,LOCHINVAR,"So faithful in love and so dauntless in war,"
4457,LOCHINVAR,There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
4458,LOCHINVAR,
4459,LOCHINVAR,"He staid not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,"
4460,LOCHINVAR,He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
4461,LOCHINVAR,"But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,"
4462,LOCHINVAR,"The bride had consented, the gallant came late;"
4463,LOCHINVAR,"For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,"
4464,LOCHINVAR,Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
4465,LOCHINVAR,
4466,LOCHINVAR,"So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall,"
4467,LOCHINVAR,"Among bride's-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:"
4468,LOCHINVAR,"Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,"
4469,LOCHINVAR,"(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,)"
4470,LOCHINVAR,"'O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,"
4471,LOCHINVAR,"Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?'"
4472,LOCHINVAR,
4473,LOCHINVAR,"'I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied;"
4474,LOCHINVAR,"Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide;"
4475,LOCHINVAR,And now am I come with this lost love of mine
4476,LOCHINVAR,"To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine."
4477,LOCHINVAR,There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far
4478,LOCHINVAR,That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.'
4479,LOCHINVAR,
4480,LOCHINVAR,"The bride kissed the goblet: the knight took it up,"
4481,LOCHINVAR,"He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup."
4482,LOCHINVAR,"She looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh,"
4483,LOCHINVAR,With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye.
4484,LOCHINVAR,"He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,"
4485,LOCHINVAR,'Now tread we a measure!' said young Lochinvar.
4486,LOCHINVAR,
4487,LOCHINVAR,"So stately his form, and so lovely her face,"
4488,LOCHINVAR,That never a hall such a galliard did grace;
4489,LOCHINVAR,"While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,"
4490,LOCHINVAR,And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
4491,LOCHINVAR,"And the bride-maidens whispered, ''Twere better by far,"
4492,LOCHINVAR,To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.'
4493,LOCHINVAR,
4494,LOCHINVAR,"One touch to her hand and one word in her ear,"
4495,LOCHINVAR,"When they reached the hall-door, and the charger stood near;"
4496,LOCHINVAR,"So light to the croup the fair lady he swung,"
4497,LOCHINVAR,So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
4498,LOCHINVAR,"'She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;"
4499,LOCHINVAR,"They'll have fleet steeds that follow,' quoth young Lochinvar."
4500,LOCHINVAR,
4501,LOCHINVAR,There was mounting 'mong GrÊmes of the Netherby clan;
4502,LOCHINVAR,"Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran:"
4503,LOCHINVAR,"There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,"
4504,LOCHINVAR,But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they see.

4519,THE MARCH,
4520,THE MARCH,"Next morn the Baron climbed the tower,"
4521,THE MARCH,To view afar the Scottish power
4522,THE MARCH,Encamped on Flodden edge:
4523,THE MARCH,"The white pavilions made a show,"
4524,THE MARCH,"Like remnants of the winter snow,"
4525,THE MARCH,Along the dusky ridge.
4526,THE MARCH,Long Marmion looked: at length his eye
4527,THE MARCH,Unusual movement might descry
4528,THE MARCH,Amid the shifting lines:
4529,THE MARCH,"The Scottish host drawn out appears,"
4530,THE MARCH,For flashing on the hedge of spears
4531,THE MARCH,The eastern sunbeam shines.
4532,THE MARCH,"Their front now deepening, now extending;"
4533,THE MARCH,"Their flank inclining, wheeling, bending,"
4534,THE MARCH,"Now drawing back, and now descending,"
4535,THE MARCH,"The skilful Marmion well could know,"
4536,THE MARCH,They watched the motions of some foe
4537,THE MARCH,Who traversed on the plain below.
4538,THE MARCH,
4539,THE MARCH,Even so it was. From Flodden ridge
4540,THE MARCH,The Scots beheld the English host
4541,THE MARCH,"Leave Barmore-wood, their evening post,"
4542,THE MARCH,And heedful watched them as they crossed
4543,THE MARCH,The Till by Twisel bridge.
4544,THE MARCH,"High sight it is and haughty, while"
4545,THE MARCH,They dive into the deep defile;
4546,THE MARCH,"Beneath the caverned cliff they fall,"
4547,THE MARCH,Beneath the castle's airy wall.
4548,THE MARCH,"By rock, by oak, by hawthorn-tree,"
4549,THE MARCH,Troop after troop are disappearing;
4550,THE MARCH,Troop after troop their banners rearing
4551,THE MARCH,Upon the eastern bank you see.
4552,THE MARCH,"Still pouring down the rocky den,"
4553,THE MARCH,"Where flows the sullen Till,"
4554,THE MARCH,"And rising from the dim-wood glen,"
4555,THE MARCH,"Standards on standards, men on men,"
4556,THE MARCH,"In slow succession still,"
4557,THE MARCH,"And sweeping o'er the Gothic arch,"
4558,THE MARCH,"And pressing on in ceaseless march,"
4559,THE MARCH,To gain the opposing hill.
4560,THE MARCH,"That morn to many a trumpet clang,"
4561,THE MARCH,Twisel! thy rocks deep echo rang;
4562,THE MARCH,"And many a chief of birth and rank,"
4563,THE MARCH,Saint Helen! at thy fountain drank.
4564,THE MARCH,"Thy hawthorn glade, which now we see"
4565,THE MARCH,"In spring-tide bloom so lavishly,"
4566,THE MARCH,"Had then from many an axe its doom,"
4567,THE MARCH,To give the marching columns room.
4568,THE MARCH,
4569,THE MARCH,"And why stands Scotland idly now,"
4570,THE MARCH,"Dark Flodden! on thy airy brow,"
4571,THE MARCH,"Since England gains the pass the while,"
4572,THE MARCH,And struggles through the deep defile?
4573,THE MARCH,What checks the fiery soul of James?
4574,THE MARCH,Why sits that champion of the dames
4575,THE MARCH,"Inactive on his steed,"
4576,THE MARCH,"And sees between him and his land,"
4577,THE MARCH,"Between him and Tweed's southern strand,"
4578,THE MARCH,His host Lord Surrey lead?
4579,THE MARCH,What 'vails the vain knight-errant's brand?
4580,THE MARCH,"O, Douglas, for thy leading wand!"
4581,THE MARCH,"Fierce Randolph, for thy speed!"
4582,THE MARCH,"O for one hour of Wallace wight,"
4583,THE MARCH,"Or well-skilled Bruce, to rule the fight,"
4584,THE MARCH,And cry 'Saint Andrew and our right!'
4585,THE MARCH,"Another sight had seen that morn,"
4586,THE MARCH,"From Fate's dark book a leaf been torn,"
4587,THE MARCH,And Flodden had been Bannockburn!
4588,THE MARCH,"The precious hour has passed in vain,"
4589,THE MARCH,And England's host has gained the plain;
4590,THE MARCH,"Wheeling their march, and circling still,"

4599,THE ATTACK,"From the sharp ridges of the hill,"
4600,THE ATTACK,All downward to the banks of Till
4601,THE ATTACK,Was wreathed in sable smoke.
4602,THE ATTACK,"Volumed and fast, and rolling far,"
4603,THE ATTACK,"The cloud enveloped Scotland's war,"
4604,THE ATTACK,As down the hill they broke;
4605,THE ATTACK,Nor martial shout nor minstrel tone
4606,THE ATTACK,"Announced their march; their tread alone,"
4607,THE ATTACK,"At times one warning trumpet blown,"
4608,THE ATTACK,"At times a stifled hum,"
4609,THE ATTACK,"Told England, from his mountain-throne"
4610,THE ATTACK,King James did rushing come.
4611,THE ATTACK,"Scarce could they hear, or see their foes,"
4612,THE ATTACK,Until at weapon-point they close.
4613,THE ATTACK,"They close in clouds of smoke and dust,"
4614,THE ATTACK,With sword-sway and with lance's thrust;
4615,THE ATTACK,And such a yell was there
4616,THE ATTACK,"Of sudden and portentous birth,"
4617,THE ATTACK,As if men fought upon the earth
4618,THE ATTACK,And fiends in upper air;
4619,THE ATTACK,"O life and death were in the shout,"
4620,THE ATTACK,"Recoil and rally, charge and rout,"

4625,THE ATTACK,At length the freshening western blast
4626,THE ATTACK,Aside the shroud of battle cast;
4627,THE ATTACK,And first the ridge of mingled spears
4628,THE ATTACK,Above the brightening cloud appears;
4629,THE ATTACK,"And in the smoke the pennons flew,"
4630,THE ATTACK,As in the storm the white sea-mew.
4631,THE ATTACK,"Then marked they, dashing broad and far,"
4632,THE ATTACK,"The broken billows of the war,"
4633,THE ATTACK,And plumËd crests of chieftains brave
4634,THE ATTACK,Floating like foam upon the wave;
4635,THE ATTACK,But nought distinct they see:
4636,THE ATTACK,Wide raged the battle on the plain;
4637,THE ATTACK,"Spears shook, and falchions flashed amain;"
4638,THE ATTACK,Fell England's arrow-flight like rain;
4639,THE ATTACK,"Crests rose, and stooped, and rose again,"
4640,THE ATTACK,Wild and disorderly.
4641,THE ATTACK,"Amid the scene of tumult, high"
4642,THE ATTACK,They saw Lord Marmion's falcon fly:
4643,THE ATTACK,And stainless Tunstall's banner white
4644,THE ATTACK,And Edmund Howard's lion bright
4645,THE ATTACK,Still bear them bravely in the fight:
4646,THE ATTACK,Although against them come
4647,THE ATTACK,"Of gallant Gordons many a one,"
4648,THE ATTACK,"And many a stubborn Badenoch-man,"
4649,THE ATTACK,"And many a rugged Border clan,"
4650,THE ATTACK,With Huntly and with Home.
4651,THE ATTACK,
4652,THE ATTACK,"Far on the left, unseen the while,"
4653,THE ATTACK,Stanley broke Lennox and Argyle;
4654,THE ATTACK,Though there the western mountaineer
4655,THE ATTACK,"Rushed with bare bosom on the spear,"
4656,THE ATTACK,"And flung the feeble targe aside,"
4657,THE ATTACK,And with both hands the broadsword plied.
4658,THE ATTACK,"'Twas vain: but Fortune, on the right,"
4659,THE ATTACK,With fickle smile cheered Scotland's fight.
4660,THE ATTACK,"Then fell that spotless banner white,"
4661,THE ATTACK,The Howard's lion fell;
4662,THE ATTACK,Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew
4663,THE ATTACK,"With wavering flight, while fiercer grew"
4664,THE ATTACK,Around the battle-yell.
4665,THE ATTACK,The Border slogan rent the sky!
4666,THE ATTACK,A Home! a Gordon! was the cry:
4667,THE ATTACK,Loud were the clanging blows;
4668,THE ATTACK,"Advanced, forced back, now low, now high,"
4669,THE ATTACK,The pennon sank and rose;
4670,THE ATTACK,"As bends the bark's mast in the gale,"
4671,THE ATTACK,"When rent are rigging, shrouds, and sail,"
4672,THE ATTACK,It wavered 'mid the foes.

4693,THE LAST STAND,"Afar the Royal Standard flies,"
4694,THE LAST STAND,"And round it toils, and bleeds, and dies"

4700,THE LAST STAND,In headlong charge their horse assailed;
4701,THE LAST STAND,"Front, flank, and rear, the squadrons sweep"
4702,THE LAST STAND,To break the Scottish circle deep

4704,THE LAST STAND,"But yet, though thick the shafts as snow,"
4705,THE LAST STAND,"Though charging knights like whirlwinds go,"
4706,THE LAST STAND,"Though bill-men ply the ghastly blow,"
4707,THE LAST STAND,Unbroken was the ring;
4708,THE LAST STAND,The stubborn spear-men still made good
4709,THE LAST STAND,"Their dark impenetrable wood,"
4710,THE LAST STAND,"Each stepping where his comrade stood,"
4711,THE LAST STAND,The instant that he fell.
4712,THE LAST STAND,No thought was there of dastard flight;
4713,THE LAST STAND,"Linked in the serried phalanx tight,"
4714,THE LAST STAND,"Groom fought like noble, squire like knight,"
4715,THE LAST STAND,As fearlessly and well;
4716,THE LAST STAND,Till utter darkness closed her wing
4717,THE LAST STAND,O'er their thin host and wounded King.
4718,THE LAST STAND,Then skilful Surrey's sage commands
4719,THE LAST STAND,Led back from strife his shattered bands;
4720,THE LAST STAND,"And from the charge they drew,"
4721,THE LAST STAND,As mountain waves from wasted lands
4722,THE LAST STAND,Sweep back to ocean blue.
4723,THE LAST STAND,Then did their loss his foemen know;
4724,THE LAST STAND,"Their King, their Lords, their mightiest low,"
4725,THE LAST STAND,"They melted from the field, as snow,"
4726,THE LAST STAND,"When streams are swoln and south winds blow,"
4727,THE LAST STAND,Dissolves in silent dew.
4728,THE LAST STAND,"Tweed's echoes heard the ceaseless plash,"
4729,THE LAST STAND,While many a broken band
4730,THE LAST STAND,"Disordered through her currents dash,"
4731,THE LAST STAND,To gain the Scottish land;
4732,THE LAST STAND,"To town and tower, to town and dale,"
4733,THE LAST STAND,"To tell red Flodden's dismal tale,"
4734,THE LAST STAND,And raise the universal wail.
4735,THE LAST STAND,"Tradition, legend, tune, and song"
4736,THE LAST STAND,Shall many an age that wail prolong:
4737,THE LAST STAND,Still from the sire the son shall hear
4738,THE LAST STAND,Of the stern strife and carnage drear
4739,THE LAST STAND,"Of Flodden's fatal field,"
4740,THE LAST STAND,"Where shivered was fair Scotland's spear,"
4741,THE LAST STAND,And broken was her shield!

4751,THE CHASE,
4752,THE CHASE,
4753,THE CHASE,"The stag at eve had drunk his fill,"
4754,THE CHASE,"Where danced the moon on Monan's rill,"
4755,THE CHASE,And deep his midnight lair had made
4756,THE CHASE,In lone Glenartney's hazel shade;
4757,THE CHASE,"But, when the sun his beacon red"
4758,THE CHASE,"Had kindled on Benvoirlich's head,"
4759,THE CHASE,The deep-mouthed bloodhound's heavy bay
4760,THE CHASE,"Resounded up the rocky way,"
4761,THE CHASE,And faint from farther distance borne
4762,THE CHASE,Were heard the clanging hoof and horn.
4763,THE CHASE,
4764,THE CHASE,"As Chief, who hears his warder call,"
4765,THE CHASE,"'To arms! the foemen storm the wall,'"
4766,THE CHASE,The antlered monarch of the waste
4767,THE CHASE,Sprang from his heathery couch in haste.
4768,THE CHASE,"But, ere his fleet career he took,"
4769,THE CHASE,The dew-drops from his flanks he shook;
4770,THE CHASE,"Like crested leader proud and high,"
4771,THE CHASE,Tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky;
4772,THE CHASE,"A moment gazed adown the dale,"
4773,THE CHASE,"A moment snuffed the tainted gale,"
4774,THE CHASE,A moment listened to the cry
4775,THE CHASE,That thickened as the chase drew nigh;
4776,THE CHASE,"Then, as the headmost foes appeared,"
4777,THE CHASE,"With one brave bound the copse he cleared,"
4778,THE CHASE,"And, stretching forward free and far,"
4779,THE CHASE,Sought the wild heaths of Uam-Var.
4780,THE CHASE,
4781,THE CHASE,Yelled on the view the opening pack;
4782,THE CHASE,"Rock, glen, and cavern paid them back:"
4783,THE CHASE,To many a mingled sound at once
4784,THE CHASE,The awakened mountain gave response.
4785,THE CHASE,"A hundred dogs bayed deep and strong,"
4786,THE CHASE,"Clattered a hundred steeds along,"
4787,THE CHASE,"Their peal the merry horns rang out,"
4788,THE CHASE,A hundred voices joined the shout;
4789,THE CHASE,With hark and whoop and wild halloo
4790,THE CHASE,No rest Benvoirlich's echoes knew.
4791,THE CHASE,"Far from the tumult fled the roe,"
4792,THE CHASE,"Close in her covert cowered the doe,"
4793,THE CHASE,The falcon from her cairn on high
4794,THE CHASE,"Cast on the rout a wondering eye,"
4795,THE CHASE,Till far beyond her piercing ken
4796,THE CHASE,The hurricane had swept the glen.
4797,THE CHASE,"Faint and more faint, its failing din"
4798,THE CHASE,"Returned from cavern, cliff, and linn,"
4799,THE CHASE,And silence settled wide and still
4800,THE CHASE,On the lone wood and mighty hill.
4801,THE CHASE,
4802,THE CHASE,Less loud the sounds of silvan war
4803,THE CHASE,"Disturbed the heights of Uam-Var,"
4804,THE CHASE,"And roused the cavern where, 'tis told,"
4805,THE CHASE,A giant made his den of old;
4806,THE CHASE,"For ere that steep ascent was won,"
4807,THE CHASE,"High in his pathway hung the sun,"
4808,THE CHASE,"And many a gallant, stayed perforce,"
4809,THE CHASE,"Was fain to breathe his faltering horse,"
4810,THE CHASE,And of the trackers of the deer
4811,THE CHASE,Scarce half the lessening pack was near;
4812,THE CHASE,So shrewdly on the mountain-side
4813,THE CHASE,Had the bold burst their mettle tried.
4814,THE CHASE,
4815,THE CHASE,The noble stag was pausing now
4816,THE CHASE,"Upon the mountain's southern brow,"
4817,THE CHASE,"Where broad extended, far beneath,"
4818,THE CHASE,The varied realms of fair Menteith.
4819,THE CHASE,With anxious eye he wandered o'er
4820,THE CHASE,"Mountain and meadow, moss and moor,"
4821,THE CHASE,And pondered refuge from his toil
4822,THE CHASE,By far Lochard or Aberfoyle.
4823,THE CHASE,But nearer was the copsewood grey
4824,THE CHASE,"That waved and wept on Loch-Achray,"
4825,THE CHASE,And mingled with the pine-trees blue
4826,THE CHASE,On the bold cliffs of Benvenue.
4827,THE CHASE,"Fresh vigour with the hope returned,"
4828,THE CHASE,"With flying foot the heath he spurned,"
4829,THE CHASE,"Held westward with unwearied race,"
4830,THE CHASE,And left behind the panting chase.
4831,THE CHASE,
4832,THE CHASE,"'Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er,"
4833,THE CHASE,As swept the hunt through Cambus-more;
4834,THE CHASE,"What reins were tightened in despair,"
4835,THE CHASE,When rose Benledi's ridge in air;
4836,THE CHASE,"Who flagged upon Bochastle's heath,"
4837,THE CHASE,"Who shunned to stem the flooded Teith,"
4838,THE CHASE,For twice that day from shore to shore
4839,THE CHASE,The gallant stag swam stoutly o'er.
4840,THE CHASE,"Few were the stragglers, following far,"
4841,THE CHASE,That reached the lake of Vennachar;
4842,THE CHASE,"And when the Brigg of Turk was won,"
4843,THE CHASE,The headmost horseman rode alone.
4844,THE CHASE,
4845,THE CHASE,"Alone, but with unbated zeal,"
4846,THE CHASE,That horseman plied the scourge and steel;
4847,THE CHASE,"For jaded now and spent with toil,"
4848,THE CHASE,"Embossed with foam and dark with soil,"
4849,THE CHASE,"While every gasp with sobs he drew,"
4850,THE CHASE,The labouring stag strained full in view.
4851,THE CHASE,"Two dogs of black Saint Hubert's breed,"
4852,THE CHASE,"Unmatched for courage, breath, and speed,"
4853,THE CHASE,Fast on his flying traces came
4854,THE CHASE,And all but won that desperate game;
4855,THE CHASE,For scarce a spear's length from his haunch
4856,THE CHASE,Vindictive toiled the bloodhounds staunch;
4857,THE CHASE,"Nor nearer might the dogs attain,"
4858,THE CHASE,Nor farther might the quarry strain.
4859,THE CHASE,"Thus up the margin of the lake,"
4860,THE CHASE,"Between the precipice and brake,"
4861,THE CHASE,O'er stock and rock their race they take.
4862,THE CHASE,
4863,THE CHASE,"The Hunter marked that mountain high,"
4864,THE CHASE,"The lone lake's western boundary,"
4865,THE CHASE,And deemed the stag must turn to bay
4866,THE CHASE,Where that huge rampart barred the way;
4867,THE CHASE,"Already glorying in the prize,"
4868,THE CHASE,Measured his antlers with his eyes;
4869,THE CHASE,For the death-wound and death-halloo
4870,THE CHASE,"Mustered his breath, his whinyard drew;"
4871,THE CHASE,"But thundering as he came prepared,"
4872,THE CHASE,"With ready arm and weapon bared,"
4873,THE CHASE,"The wily quarry shunned the shock,"
4874,THE CHASE,And turned him from the opposing rock;
4875,THE CHASE,"Then, dashing down a darksome glen,"
4876,THE CHASE,"Soon lost to hound and hunter's ken,"
4877,THE CHASE,In the deep Trosach's wildest nook
4878,THE CHASE,His solitary refuge took.
4879,THE CHASE,"There, while close couched, the thicket shed"
4880,THE CHASE,"Cold dews and wild-flowers on his head,"
4881,THE CHASE,He heard the baffled dogs in vain
4882,THE CHASE,"Rave through the hollow pass amain,"
4883,THE CHASE,Chiding the rocks that yelled again.
4884,THE CHASE,
4885,THE CHASE,"Close on the hounds the hunter came,"
4886,THE CHASE,To cheer them on the vanished game;
4887,THE CHASE,"But, stumbling in the rugged dell,"
4888,THE CHASE,The gallant horse exhausted fell.
4889,THE CHASE,The impatient rider strove in vain
4890,THE CHASE,"To rouse him with the spur and rein,"
4891,THE CHASE,"For the good steed, his labours o'er,"
4892,THE CHASE,"Stretched his stiff limbs, to rise no more;"
4893,THE CHASE,Then touched with pity and remorse
4894,THE CHASE,He sorrowed o'er the expiring horse.
4895,THE CHASE,"'I little thought, when first thy rein"
4896,THE CHASE,"I slacked upon the banks of Seine,"
4897,THE CHASE,That Highland eagle e'er should feed
4898,THE CHASE,"On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed!"
4899,THE CHASE,"Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,"
4900,THE CHASE,"That costs thy life, my gallant grey!'"
4901,THE CHASE,
4902,THE CHASE,"Then through the dell his horn resounds,"
4903,THE CHASE,From vain pursuit to call the hounds.
4904,THE CHASE,Back limped with slow and crippled pace
4905,THE CHASE,The sulky leaders of the chase;
4906,THE CHASE,"Close to their master's side they pressed,"
4907,THE CHASE,With drooping tail and humbled crest;
4908,THE CHASE,But still the dingle's hollow throat
4909,THE CHASE,Prolonged the swelling bugle-note.
4910,THE CHASE,"The owlets started from their dream,"
4911,THE CHASE,"The eagles answered with their scream,"
4912,THE CHASE,"Round and around the sounds were cast,"
4913,THE CHASE,Till echoes seemed an answering blast;
4914,THE CHASE,"And on the hunter hied his way,"
4915,THE CHASE,To join some comrades of the day.

5207,BONNY DUNDEE,"As he rode down the sanctified bends of the Bow,"

5211,BONNY DUNDEE,

5236,BONNY DUNDEE,
5237,BONNY DUNDEE,There's brass on the target of barkened bull-hide;

5270,ROMANCE,Through caverns measureless to man
5271,ROMANCE,Down to a sunless sea.
5272,ROMANCE,So twice five miles of fertile ground
5273,ROMANCE,With walls and towers were girdled round:

5275,ROMANCE,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
5276,ROMANCE,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
5277,ROMANCE,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

5284,ROMANCE,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,"

5292,ROMANCE,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
5293,ROMANCE,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"

5303,ROMANCE,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
5304,ROMANCE,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
5305,ROMANCE,A damsel with a dulcimer
5306,ROMANCE,In a vision once I saw:
5307,ROMANCE,"It was an Abyssinian maid,"

5553,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"Sing the glorious day's renown,"
5554,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,When to battle fierce came forth
5555,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"All the might of Denmark's crown,"
5556,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,And her arms along the deep proudly shone;
5557,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,By each gun the lighted brand
5558,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"In a bold determined hand,"
5559,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,And the Prince of all the land
5560,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Led them on.
5561,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,
5562,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"Like leviathans afloat,"

5565,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,On the lofty British line:
5566,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,It was ten of April morn by the chime:
5567,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"As they drifted on their path,"
5568,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,There was silence deep as death;
5569,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"And the boldest held his breath,"
5570,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,For a time.
5571,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,
5572,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,But the might of England flushed
5573,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,To anticipate the scene;
5574,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,And her van the fleeter rushed
5575,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,O'er the deadly space between.
5576,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,'Hearts of oak!' our captains cried; when each gun
5577,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,From its adamantine lips
5578,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"Spread a death-shade round the ships,"
5579,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Like the hurricane eclipse
5580,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Of the sun.
5581,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,
5582,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Again! again! again!
5583,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"And the havoc did not slack,"
5584,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"Till a feeble cheer the Dane,"
5585,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,To our cheering sent us back;--
5586,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Their shots along the deep slowly boom:--
5587,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"Then cease--and all is wail,"
5588,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,As they strike the shattered sail;
5589,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"Or, in conflagration pale"
5590,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Light the gloom.
5591,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,
5592,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"Now joy, Old England, raise"
5593,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"For the tidings of thy might,"
5594,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"By the festal cities' blaze,"
5595,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Whilst the wine-cup shines in light;
5596,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"And yet amidst that joy and uproar,"
5597,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Let us think of them that sleep
5598,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Full many a fathom deep
5599,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,"By thy wild and stormy steep,"
5600,THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC,Elsinore!

5958,THE MAGAZINE,"Madonna's face upon him shone,"
5959,THE MAGAZINE,"Painted in heavenly hues above,"
5960,THE MAGAZINE,With eyes of light and looks of love;
5961,THE MAGAZINE,And placed upon that holy shrine
5962,THE MAGAZINE,"To fix our thoughts on things divine,"
5963,THE MAGAZINE,"When pictured there, we kneeling see"
5964,THE MAGAZINE,"Her, and the boy-God on her knee,"
5965,THE MAGAZINE,Smiling sweetly on each prayer
5966,THE MAGAZINE,"To heaven, as if to waft it there."
5967,THE MAGAZINE,"Still she smiled; even now she smiles,"
5968,THE MAGAZINE,Though slaughter streams along her aisles:
5969,THE MAGAZINE,"Minotti lifted his aged eye,"
5970,THE MAGAZINE,"And made the sign of a cross with a sigh,"
5971,THE MAGAZINE,Then seized a torch which blazed thereby;
5972,THE MAGAZINE,"And still he stood, while with steel and flame"
5973,THE MAGAZINE,Inward and onward the Mussulman came.
5974,THE MAGAZINE,
5975,THE MAGAZINE,The vaults beneath the mosaic stone
5976,THE MAGAZINE,Contained the dead of ages gone;
5977,THE MAGAZINE,"Their names were on the graven floor,"
5978,THE MAGAZINE,But now illegible with gore;
5979,THE MAGAZINE,"The carvËd crests, and curious hues"
5980,THE MAGAZINE,"The varied marble's veins diffuse,"
5981,THE MAGAZINE,"Were smeared, and slippery, stained, and strown"
5982,THE MAGAZINE,With broken swords and helms o'erthrown:
5983,THE MAGAZINE,"There were dead above, and the dead below"
5984,THE MAGAZINE,Lay cold in many a coffined row;
5985,THE MAGAZINE,"You might see them piled in sable state,"
5986,THE MAGAZINE,By a pale light through a gloomy grate;
5987,THE MAGAZINE,"But War had entered their dark caves,"
5988,THE MAGAZINE,And stored along the vaulted graves
5989,THE MAGAZINE,"Her sulphurous treasures, thickly spread"
5990,THE MAGAZINE,In masses by the fleshless dead:
5991,THE MAGAZINE,"Here, throughout the siege, had been"
5992,THE MAGAZINE,The Christians' chiefest magazine;
5993,THE MAGAZINE,"To these a late formed train now led,"
5994,THE MAGAZINE,Minotti's last and stern resource
5995,THE MAGAZINE,Against the foe's o'erwhelming force.
5996,THE MAGAZINE,
5997,THE MAGAZINE,"The foe came on, and few remain"
5998,THE MAGAZINE,"To strive, and those must strive in vain:"
5999,THE MAGAZINE,"For lack of further lives, to slake"
6000,THE MAGAZINE,"The thirst of vengeance now awake,"
6001,THE MAGAZINE,"With barbarous blows they gash the dead,"
6002,THE MAGAZINE,"And lop the already lifeless head,"
6003,THE MAGAZINE,"And fell the statues from their niche,"
6004,THE MAGAZINE,"And spoil the shrines of offerings rich,"
6005,THE MAGAZINE,And from each other's rude hands wrest
6006,THE MAGAZINE,The silver vessels saints had blessed.
6007,THE MAGAZINE,To the high altar on they go;
6008,THE MAGAZINE,"O, but it made a glorious show!"
6009,THE MAGAZINE,On its table still behold
6010,THE MAGAZINE,The cup of consecrated gold;
6011,THE MAGAZINE,"Massy and deep, a glittering prize,"
6012,THE MAGAZINE,Brightly it sparkles to plunderers' eyes:
6013,THE MAGAZINE,"That morn it held the holy wine,"
6014,THE MAGAZINE,"Converted by Christ to his blood so divine,"
6015,THE MAGAZINE,"Which his worshippers drank at the break of day,"
6016,THE MAGAZINE,To shrive their souls ere they joined in the fray.
6017,THE MAGAZINE,Still a few drops within it lay;
6018,THE MAGAZINE,And round the sacred table glow
6019,THE MAGAZINE,"Twelve lofty lamps, in splendid row,"
6020,THE MAGAZINE,From the purest metal cast;
6021,THE MAGAZINE,"A spoil--the richest, and the last."
6022,THE MAGAZINE,
6023,THE MAGAZINE,"So near they came, the nearest stretched"
6024,THE MAGAZINE,"To grasp the spoil he almost reached,"
6025,THE MAGAZINE,When old Minotti's hand
6026,THE MAGAZINE,Touched with the torch the train--
6027,THE MAGAZINE,'Tis fired!
6028,THE MAGAZINE,"Spire, vaults, the shrine, the spoil, the slain,"
6029,THE MAGAZINE,"The turbaned victors, the Christian band,"
6030,THE MAGAZINE,"All that of living or dead remain,"
6031,THE MAGAZINE,"Hurl'd on high with the shivered fane,"
6032,THE MAGAZINE,In one wild roar expired!
6033,THE MAGAZINE,The shattered town--the walls thrown down--
6034,THE MAGAZINE,The waves a moment backward bent--
6035,THE MAGAZINE,"The hills that shake, although unrent,"
6036,THE MAGAZINE,As if an earthquake passed--
6037,THE MAGAZINE,The thousand shapeless things all driven
6038,THE MAGAZINE,In cloud and flame athwart the heaven
6039,THE MAGAZINE,By that tremendous blast--
6040,THE MAGAZINE,Proclaimed the desperate conflict o'er
6041,THE MAGAZINE,On that too long afflicted shore:
6042,THE MAGAZINE,Up to the sky like rockets go
6043,THE MAGAZINE,All that mingled there below:
6044,THE MAGAZINE,"Many a tall and goodly man,"
6045,THE MAGAZINE,"Scorched and shrivelled to a span,"
6046,THE MAGAZINE,When he fell to earth again
6047,THE MAGAZINE,Like a cinder strewed the plain:
6048,THE MAGAZINE,Down the ashes shower like rain;
6049,THE MAGAZINE,"Some fell in the gulf, which received the sprinkles"
6050,THE MAGAZINE,With a thousand circling wrinkles;
6051,THE MAGAZINE,"Some fell on the shore, but far away"
6052,THE MAGAZINE,Scattered o'er the isthmus lay;
6053,THE MAGAZINE,"Christian or Moslem, which be they?"
6054,THE MAGAZINE,Let their mother say and say!
6055,THE MAGAZINE,"When in cradled rest they lay,"
6056,THE MAGAZINE,And each nursing mother smiled
6057,THE MAGAZINE,"On the sweet sleep of her child,"
6058,THE MAGAZINE,Little deemed she such a day
6059,THE MAGAZINE,Would rend those tender limbs away.
6060,THE MAGAZINE,Not the matrons that them bore
6061,THE MAGAZINE,Could discern their offspring more;
6062,THE MAGAZINE,That one moment left no trace
6063,THE MAGAZINE,More of human form or face
6064,THE MAGAZINE,Save a scattered scalp or bone:
6065,THE MAGAZINE,"And down came blazing rafters, strown"
6066,THE MAGAZINE,"Around, and many a falling stone,"
6067,THE MAGAZINE,"Deeply dinted in the clay,"
6068,THE MAGAZINE,All blackened there and reeking lay.
6069,THE MAGAZINE,All the living things that heard
6070,THE MAGAZINE,That deadly earth-shock disappeared:
6071,THE MAGAZINE,"The wild birds flew; the wild dogs fled,"
6072,THE MAGAZINE,And howling left the unburied dead;
6073,THE MAGAZINE,The camels from their keepers broke;
6074,THE MAGAZINE,The distant steer forsook the yoke--
6075,THE MAGAZINE,"The nearer steed plunged o'er the plain,"
6076,THE MAGAZINE,"And burst his girth, and tore his rein;"
6077,THE MAGAZINE,The bull-frog's note from out the marsh
6078,THE MAGAZINE,"Deep-mouthed arose, and doubly harsh;"
6079,THE MAGAZINE,The wolves yelled on the caverned hill
6080,THE MAGAZINE,Where echo rolled in thunder still;
6081,THE MAGAZINE,The jackals' troop in gathered cry
6082,THE MAGAZINE,"Bayed from afar complainingly,"
6083,THE MAGAZINE,"With a mixed and mournful sound,"
6084,THE MAGAZINE,"Like crying babe, and beaten hound:"
6085,THE MAGAZINE,With sudden wing and ruffled breast
6086,THE MAGAZINE,"The eagle left his rocky nest,"
6087,THE MAGAZINE,"And mounted nearer to the sun,"
6088,THE MAGAZINE,The clouds beneath him seemed so dun;
6089,THE MAGAZINE,"Their smoke assailed his startled beak,"
6090,THE MAGAZINE,And made him higher soar and shriek--
6091,THE MAGAZINE,Thus was Corinth lost and won!

6107,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6108,ALHAMA,
6109,ALHAMA,Letters to the monarch tell
6110,ALHAMA,How Alhama's city fell:
6111,ALHAMA,"In the fire the scroll he threw,"
6112,ALHAMA,And the messenger he slew.
6113,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6114,ALHAMA,

6124,ALHAMA,With the silver clarion round.
6125,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6126,ALHAMA,

6128,ALHAMA,"Beat the loud alarm afar,"
6129,ALHAMA,That the Moors of town and plain
6130,ALHAMA,Might answer to the martial strain--
6131,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!--"

6137,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"

6143,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"

6157,ALHAMA,"By thee were slain, in evil hour,"
6158,ALHAMA,"The Abencerrage, Granada's flower;"

6161,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6162,ALHAMA,
6163,ALHAMA,"And for this, O King! is sent"

6166,ALHAMA,One last wreck shall overwhelm.
6167,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6168,ALHAMA,
6169,ALHAMA,"He who holds no laws in awe,"
6170,ALHAMA,He must perish by the law;

6172,ALHAMA,And thyself with her undone.'
6173,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6174,ALHAMA,
6175,ALHAMA,"Fire flashed from out the old Moor's eyes,"
6176,ALHAMA,"The monarch's wrath began to rise,"

6187,ALHAMA,Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui!
6188,ALHAMA,"Though thy beard so hoary be,"

6217,ALHAMA,"I lost a damsel in that hour,"
6218,ALHAMA,Of all the land the loveliest flower;

6221,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6222,ALHAMA,
6223,ALHAMA,"And as these things the old Moor said,"
6224,ALHAMA,They severed from the trunk his head;
6225,ALHAMA,And to the Alhambra's wall with speed
6226,ALHAMA,"'Twas carried, as the King decreed."
6227,ALHAMA,"Woe is me, Alhama!"
6228,ALHAMA,
6229,ALHAMA,And men and infants therein weep

6780,THE TRYSTING,East and west and south and north
6781,THE TRYSTING,"The messengers ride fast,"
6782,THE TRYSTING,And tower and town and cottage
6783,THE TRYSTING,Have heard the trumpet's blast.
6784,THE TRYSTING,Shame on the false Etruscan
6785,THE TRYSTING,"Who lingers in his home,"
6786,THE TRYSTING,When Porsena of Clusium
6787,THE TRYSTING,Is on the march for Rome.
6788,THE TRYSTING,
6789,THE TRYSTING,The horsemen and the footmen
6790,THE TRYSTING,Are pouring in amain
6791,THE TRYSTING,"From many a stately market-place,"
6792,THE TRYSTING,From many a fruitful plain;
6793,THE TRYSTING,From many a lonely hamlet
6794,THE TRYSTING,"Which, hid by beech and pine,"
6795,THE TRYSTING,Like an eagle's nest hangs on the crest
6796,THE TRYSTING,Of purple Apennine;
6797,THE TRYSTING,
6798,THE TRYSTING,"From lordly VolaterrÊ,"
6799,THE TRYSTING,Where scowls the far-famed hold
6800,THE TRYSTING,Piled by the hands of giants
6801,THE TRYSTING,For godlike kings of old;
6802,THE TRYSTING,From sea-girt Populonia
6803,THE TRYSTING,Whose sentinels descry
6804,THE TRYSTING,Sardinia's snowy mountain-tops
6805,THE TRYSTING,Fringing the southern sky;
6806,THE TRYSTING,
6807,THE TRYSTING,"From the proud mart of PisÊ,"
6808,THE TRYSTING,"Queen of the western waves,"
6809,THE TRYSTING,Where ride Massilia's triremes
6810,THE TRYSTING,Heavy with fair-haired slaves;
6811,THE TRYSTING,From where sweet Clanis wanders
6812,THE TRYSTING,Through corn and vines and flowers;
6813,THE TRYSTING,From where Cortona lifts to heaven
6814,THE TRYSTING,Her diadem of towers.
6815,THE TRYSTING,
6816,THE TRYSTING,Tall are the oaks whose acorns
6817,THE TRYSTING,Drop in dark Auser's rill;
6818,THE TRYSTING,Fat are the stags that champ the boughs
6819,THE TRYSTING,Of the Ciminian hill;
6820,THE TRYSTING,Beyond all streams Clitumnus
6821,THE TRYSTING,Is to the herdsman dear;
6822,THE TRYSTING,Best of all pools the fowler loves
6823,THE TRYSTING,The great Volsinian mere.
6824,THE TRYSTING,
6825,THE TRYSTING,But now no stroke of woodman
6826,THE TRYSTING,Is heard by Auser's rill;
6827,THE TRYSTING,No hunter tracks the stag's green path
6828,THE TRYSTING,Up the Ciminian hill;
6829,THE TRYSTING,Unwatched along Clitumnus
6830,THE TRYSTING,Grazes the milk-white steer;
6831,THE TRYSTING,Unharmed the water-fowl may dip
6832,THE TRYSTING,In the Volsinian mere.
6833,THE TRYSTING,
6834,THE TRYSTING,The harvests of Arretium
6835,THE TRYSTING,This year old men shall reap;
6836,THE TRYSTING,This year young boys in Umbro
6837,THE TRYSTING,Shall plunge the struggling sheep;
6838,THE TRYSTING,And in the vats of Luna
6839,THE TRYSTING,This year the must shall foam
6840,THE TRYSTING,Round the white feet of laughing girls
6841,THE TRYSTING,Whose sires have marched to Rome.
6842,THE TRYSTING,
6843,THE TRYSTING,"There be thirty chosen prophets,"
6844,THE TRYSTING,"The wisest of the land,"
6845,THE TRYSTING,Who alway by Lars Porsena
6846,THE TRYSTING,Both morn and evening stand:
6847,THE TRYSTING,Evening and morn the Thirty
6848,THE TRYSTING,"Have turned the verses o'er,"
6849,THE TRYSTING,Traced from the right on linen white
6850,THE TRYSTING,By mighty seers of yore.
6851,THE TRYSTING,
6852,THE TRYSTING,And with one voice the Thirty
6853,THE TRYSTING,Have their glad answer given:
6854,THE TRYSTING,"'Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena;"
6855,THE TRYSTING,"Go forth, beloved of Heaven;"
6856,THE TRYSTING,"Go, and return in glory"
6857,THE TRYSTING,"To Clusium's royal dome,"
6858,THE TRYSTING,And hang round Nurscia's altars
6859,THE TRYSTING,The golden shields of Rome.'
6860,THE TRYSTING,
6861,THE TRYSTING,And now hath every city
6862,THE TRYSTING,Sent up her tale of men;
6863,THE TRYSTING,"The foot are fourscore thousand,"
6864,THE TRYSTING,The horse are thousands ten.
6865,THE TRYSTING,Before the gates of Sutrium
6866,THE TRYSTING,Is met the great array.
6867,THE TRYSTING,A proud man was Lars Porsena
6868,THE TRYSTING,Upon the trysting day!
6869,THE TRYSTING,
6870,THE TRYSTING,For all the Etruscan armies
6871,THE TRYSTING,"Were ranged beneath his eye,"
6872,THE TRYSTING,"And many a banished Roman,"
6873,THE TRYSTING,And many a stout ally;
6874,THE TRYSTING,And with a mighty following
6875,THE TRYSTING,To join the muster came
6876,THE TRYSTING,"The Tusculan Mamilius,"
6877,THE TRYSTING,Prince of the Latian name.
6878,THE TRYSTING,
6879,THE TRYSTING,
6880,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,THE TROUBLE IN ROME
6881,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6882,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,But by the yellow Tiber
6883,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Was tumult and affright:
6884,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,From all the spacious champaign
6885,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,To Rome men took their flight.
6886,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,A mile around the city
6887,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,The throng stopped up the ways;
6888,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,A fearful sight it was to see
6889,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Through two long nights and days.
6890,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6891,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"For aged folk on crutches,"
6892,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And women great with child,"
6893,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And mothers sobbing over babes
6894,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"That clung to them and smiled,"
6895,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And sick men borne in litters
6896,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"High on the necks of slaves,"
6897,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And troops of sun-burned husbandmen
6898,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"With reaping-hooks and staves,"
6899,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6900,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And droves of mules and asses
6901,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Laden with skins of wine,"
6902,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And endless flocks of goats and sheep,"
6903,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And endless herds of kine,"
6904,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And endless trains of waggons
6905,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,That creaked beneath the weight
6906,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Of corn-sacks and of household goods,"
6907,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Choked every roaring gate.
6908,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6909,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Now from the rock Tarpeian
6910,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Could the wan burghers spy
6911,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,The line of blazing villages
6912,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Red in the midnight sky.
6913,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"The Fathers of the City,"
6914,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"They sat all night and day,"
6915,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,For every hour some horseman came
6916,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,With tidings of dismay.
6917,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6918,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,To eastward and to westward
6919,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Have spread the Tuscan bands;
6920,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Nor house, nor fence, nor dovecote"
6921,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,In Crustumerium stands.
6922,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Verbenna down to Ostia
6923,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Hath wasted all the plain;
6924,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Astur hath stormed Janiculum,"
6925,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And the stout guards are slain.
6926,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6927,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"I wis, in all the Senate"
6928,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,There was no heart so bold
6929,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"But sore it ached, and fast it beat,"
6930,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,When that ill news was told.
6931,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Forthwith up rose the Consul,"
6932,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Up rose the Fathers all;
6933,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"In haste they girded up their gowns,"
6934,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And hied them to the wall.
6935,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6936,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,They held a council standing
6937,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Before the River-Gate;
6938,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Short time was there, ye well may guess,"
6939,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,For musing or debate.
6940,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Out spake the Consul roundly:
6941,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,'The bridge must straight go down;
6942,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"For, since Janiculum is lost,"
6943,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Nought else can save the town.'
6944,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6945,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Just then a scout came flying,"
6946,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,All wild with haste and fear:
6947,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,'To arms! to arms! Sir Consul:
6948,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Lars Porsena is here.'
6949,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,On the low hills to westward
6950,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"The Consul fixed his eye,"
6951,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And saw the swarthy storm of dust
6952,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Rise fast along the sky.
6953,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6954,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And nearer fast and nearer
6955,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Doth the red whirlwind come;
6956,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And louder still and still more loud,"
6957,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,From underneath that rolling cloud
6958,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Is heard the trumpet's war-note proud,"
6959,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"The trampling, and the hum."
6960,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And plainly and more plainly
6961,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Now through the gloom appears,"
6962,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Far to left and far to right,"
6963,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"In broken gleams of dark-blue light,"
6964,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"The long array of helmets bright,"
6965,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,The long array of spears.
6966,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6967,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And plainly and more plainly
6968,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Above that glimmering line
6969,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Now might ye see the banners
6970,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Of twelve fair cities shine;
6971,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,But the banner of proud Clusium
6972,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Was highest of them all,"
6973,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"The terror of the Umbrian,"
6974,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,The terror of the Gaul.
6975,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6976,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And plainly and more plainly
6977,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Now might the burghers know,"
6978,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"By port and vest, by horse and crest,"
6979,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Each warlike Lucumo.
6980,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,There Cilnius of Arretium
6981,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,On his fleet roan was seen;
6982,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And Astur of the fourfold shield,"
6983,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Girt with the brand none else may wield,"
6984,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Tolumnius with the belt of gold,"
6985,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And dark Verbenna from the hold
6986,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,By reedy Thrasymene.
6987,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6988,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Fast by the royal standard
6989,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"O'erlooking all the war,"
6990,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Lars Porsena of Clusium
6991,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Sate in his ivory car.
6992,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"By the right wheel rode Mamilius,"
6993,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Prince of the Latian name;
6994,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And by the left false Sextus,"
6995,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,That wrought the deed of shame.
6996,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
6997,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,But when the face of Sextus
6998,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Was seen among the foes,"
6999,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,A yell that rent the firmament
7000,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,From all the town arose.
7001,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,On the house-tops was no woman
7002,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"But spat towards him, and hissed;"
7003,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"No child but screamed out curses,"
7004,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And shook its little fist.
7005,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7006,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"But the Consul's brow was sad,"
7007,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And the Consul's speech was low,"
7008,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And darkly looked he at the wall,"
7009,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And darkly at the foe.
7010,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,'Their van will be upon us
7011,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Before the bridge goes down;
7012,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And if they once may win the bridge,"
7013,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,What hope to save the town?'
7014,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7015,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Then out spake brave Horatius,"
7016,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,The Captain of the gate:
7017,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,'To every man upon this earth
7018,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Death cometh soon or late;
7019,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And how can man die better
7020,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Than facing fearful odds,"
7021,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,For the ashes of his fathers
7022,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And the temples of his Gods,"
7023,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7024,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And for the tender mother
7025,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Who dandled him to rest,"
7026,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And for the wife who nurses
7027,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"His baby at her breast,"
7028,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And for the holy maidens
7029,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Who feed the eternal flame,"
7030,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,To save them from false Sextus
7031,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,That wrought the deed of shame?
7032,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7033,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,"
7034,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,With all the speed ye may;
7035,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"I, with two more to help me,"
7036,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Will hold the foe in play.
7037,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,In yon strait path a thousand
7038,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,May well be stopped by three.
7039,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Now who will stand on either hand,"
7040,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And keep the bridge with me?'
7041,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7042,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Then out spake Spurius Lartius,"
7043,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,A Ramnian proud was he:
7044,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"'Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,"
7045,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And keep the bridge with thee.'
7046,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And out spake strong Heminius,"
7047,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Of Titian blood was he:
7048,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"'I will abide on thy left side,"
7049,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And keep the bridge with thee.'
7050,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7051,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"'Horatius,' quoth the Consul,"
7052,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"'As thou sayest, so let it be.'"
7053,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And straight against that great array
7054,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Forth went the dauntless Three.
7055,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,For Romans in Rome's quarrel
7056,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Spared neither land nor gold,"
7057,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,"
7058,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,In the brave days of old.
7059,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7060,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Then none was for a party;
7061,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Then all were for the state;
7062,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"Then the great man helped the poor,"
7063,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And the poor man loved the great:
7064,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Then lands were fairly portioned;
7065,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Then spoils were fairly sold:
7066,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,The Romans were like brothers
7067,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,In the brave days of old.
7068,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7069,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Now Roman is to Roman
7070,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"More hateful than a foe,"
7071,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"And the Tribunes beard the high,"
7072,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,And the Fathers grind the low.
7073,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,"As we wax hot in faction,"
7074,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,In battle we wax cold:
7075,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,Wherefore men fight not as they fought
7076,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,In the brave days of old.
7077,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7078,THE TROUBLE IN ROME,
7079,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE
7080,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7081,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Now while the Three were tightening
7082,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Their harness on their backs,"
7083,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The Consul was the foremost man
7084,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To take in hand an axe:
7085,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And Fathers mixed with Commons
7086,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Seized hatchet, bar, and crow,"
7087,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And smote upon the planks above,"
7088,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And loosed the props below.
7089,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7090,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Meanwhile the Tuscan army,"
7091,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Right glorious to behold,"
7092,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Came flashing back the noonday light,"
7093,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Rank behind rank, like surges bright"
7094,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Of a broad sea of gold.
7095,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Four hundred trumpets sounded
7096,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"A peal of warlike glee,"
7097,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"As that great host, with measured tread,"
7098,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,"
7099,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Rolled slowly towards the bridge's head,"
7100,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Where stood the dauntless Three.
7101,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7102,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"The Three stood calm and silent,"
7103,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And looked upon the foes,"
7104,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And a great shout of laughter
7105,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,From all the vanguard rose:
7106,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And forth three chiefs came spurring
7107,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Before that deep array;
7108,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"To earth they sprang, their swords they drew,"
7109,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And lifted high their shields, and flew"
7110,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To win the narrow way;
7111,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7112,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Aunus from green Tifernum,"
7113,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Lord of the Hill of Vines;
7114,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves"
7115,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Sicken in Ilva's mines;
7116,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And Picus, long to Clusium"
7117,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Vassal in peace and war,"
7118,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Who led to fight his Umbrian powers
7119,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"From that grey crag where, girt with towers,"
7120,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The fortress of Nequinum lowers
7121,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,O'er the pale waves of Nar.
7122,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7123,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus
7124,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Into the stream beneath:
7125,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Herminius struck at Seius,"
7126,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And clove him to the teeth:
7127,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,At Picus brave Horatius
7128,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Darted one fiery thrust,"
7129,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And the proud Umbrian's gilded arms
7130,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Clashed in the bloody dust.
7131,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7132,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Then Ocnus of Falerii
7133,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Rushed on the Roman Three;
7134,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And Lausulus of Urgo,"
7135,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The rover of the sea;
7136,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And Aruns of Volsinium,"
7137,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Who slew the great wild boar,"
7138,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The great wild boar that had his den
7139,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Amidst the reeds of Cosa's fen,"
7140,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,"
7141,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Along Albinia's shore.
7142,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7143,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Herminius smote down Aruns:
7144,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Lartius laid Ocnus low:
7145,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Right to the heart of Lausulus
7146,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Horatius sent a blow.
7147,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"'Lie there,' he cried, 'fell pirate!"
7148,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"No more, aghast and pale,"
7149,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
7150,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The track of thy destroying bark.
7151,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,No more Campania's hinds shall fly
7152,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To woods and caverns when they spy
7153,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Thy thrice-accursed sail.'
7154,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7155,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,But now no sound of laughter
7156,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Was heard amongst the foes.
7157,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,A wild and wrathful clamour
7158,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,From all the vanguard rose.
7159,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Six spears' lengths from the entrance
7160,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Halted that deep array,"
7161,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And for a space no man came forth
7162,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To win the narrow way.
7163,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7164,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,But hark! the cry is Astur:
7165,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And lo! the ranks divide;
7166,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And the great Lord of Luna
7167,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Comes with his stately stride.
7168,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Upon his ample shoulders
7169,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Clangs loud the fourfold shield,"
7170,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And in his hand he shakes the brand
7171,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Which none but he can wield.
7172,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7173,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,He smiled on those bold Romans
7174,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,A smile serene and high;
7175,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"He eyed the flinching Tuscans,"
7176,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And scorn was in his eye.
7177,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Quoth he, 'The she-wolf's litter"
7178,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Stands savagely at bay:
7179,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"But will ye dare to follow,"
7180,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,If Astur clears the way?'
7181,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7182,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Then, whirling up his broadsword"
7183,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"With both hands to the height,"
7184,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"He rushed against Horatius,"
7185,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And smote with all his might.
7186,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,With shield and blade Horatius
7187,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Right deftly turned the blow.
7188,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;"
7189,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:"
7190,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The Tuscans raised a joyful cry
7191,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To see the red blood flow.
7192,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7193,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"He reeled, and on Herminius"
7194,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,He leaned one breathing-space;
7195,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Then, like a wild cat mad with wounds,"
7196,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Sprang right at Astur's face.
7197,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Through teeth, and skull, and helmet,"
7198,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,So fierce a thrust he sped
7199,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The good sword stood a handbreadth out
7200,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Behind the Tuscan's head.
7201,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7202,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And the great Lord of Luna
7203,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Fell at that deadly stroke,"
7204,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,As falls on Mount Alvernus
7205,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,A thunder-smitten oak:
7206,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Far o'er the crashing forest
7207,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The giant arms lie spread;
7208,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And the pale augurs, muttering low,"
7209,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Gaze on the blasted head.
7210,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7211,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,On Astur's throat Horatius
7212,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Right firmly pressed his heel,"
7213,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And thrice and four times tugged amain,"
7214,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Ere he wrenched out the steel.
7215,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"'And see,' he cried, 'the welcome,"
7216,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Fair guests, that waits you here!"
7217,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,What noble Lucumo comes next
7218,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To taste our Roman cheer?'
7219,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7220,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,But at his haughty challenge
7221,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"A sullen murmur ran,"
7222,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Mingled of wrath and shame and dread,"
7223,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Along that glittering van.
7224,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"There lacked not men of prowess,"
7225,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Nor men of lordly race;
7226,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,For all Etruria's noblest
7227,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Were round the fatal place.
7228,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7229,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,But all Etruria's noblest
7230,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Felt their hearts sink to see
7231,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"On the earth the bloody corpses,"
7232,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,In the path the dauntless Three:
7233,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And, from the ghastly entrance"
7234,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Where those bold Romans stood,"
7235,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"All shrank, like boys who unaware,"
7236,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Ranging the woods to start a hare,"
7237,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Come to the mouth of the dark lair
7238,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Where, growling low, a fierce old bear"
7239,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Lies amidst bones and blood.
7240,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7241,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Was none who would be foremost
7242,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To lead such dire attack;
7243,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,But those behind cried 'Forward!'
7244,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And those before cried 'Back!'
7245,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And backward now and forward
7246,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Wavers the deep array;
7247,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And on the tossing sea of steel,"
7248,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,To and fro the standards reel;
7249,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And the victorious trumpet-peal
7250,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Dies fitfully away.
7251,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7252,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Yet one man for one moment
7253,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Strode out before the crowd;
7254,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Well known was he to all the Three,"
7255,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And they gave him greeting loud.
7256,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"'Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!"
7257,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Now welcome to thy home!
7258,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Why dost thou stay, and turn away?"
7259,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Here lies the road to Rome.'
7260,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7261,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Thrice looked he at the city;
7262,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Thrice looked he at the dead;
7263,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And thrice came on in fury,"
7264,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And thrice turned back in dread:
7265,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And, white with fear and hatred,"
7266,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Scowled at the narrow way
7267,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Where, wallowing in a pool of blood,"
7268,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,The bravest Tuscans lay.
7269,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7270,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,But meanwhile axe and lever
7271,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Have manfully been plied;
7272,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And now the bridge hangs tottering
7273,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Above the boiling tide.
7274,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"'Come back, come back, Horatius!'"
7275,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Loud cried the Fathers all.
7276,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"'Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!"
7277,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Back, ere the ruin fall!'"
7278,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7279,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Back darted Spurius Lartius;
7280,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Herminius darted back:
7281,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And, as they passed, beneath their feet"
7282,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,They felt the timbers crack.
7283,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"But, when they turned their faces,"
7284,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And on the farther shore
7285,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Saw brave Horatius stand alone,"
7286,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,They would have crossed once more.
7287,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7288,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,But with a crash like thunder
7289,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Fell every loosened beam,"
7290,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And, like a dam, the mighty wreck"
7291,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Lay right athwart the stream:
7292,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And a long shout of triumph
7293,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Rose from the walls of Rome,"
7294,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,As to the highest turret-tops
7295,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Was splashed the yellow foam.
7296,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7297,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And, like a horse unbroken"
7298,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"When first he feels the rein,"
7299,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"The furious river struggled hard,"
7300,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,And tossed his tawny mane;
7301,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And burst the curb, and bounded,"
7302,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Rejoicing to be free;
7303,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"And whirling down, in fierce career,"
7304,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,"Battlement, and plank, and pier,"
7305,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,Rushed headlong to the sea.
7306,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7307,THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE,
7308,FATHER TIBER,FATHER TIBER
7309,FATHER TIBER,
7310,FATHER TIBER,"Alone stood brave Horatius,"
7311,FATHER TIBER,But constant still in mind;
7312,FATHER TIBER,"Thrice thirty thousand foes before,"
7313,FATHER TIBER,And the broad flood behind.
7314,FATHER TIBER,"'Down with him!' cried false Sextus,"
7315,FATHER TIBER,With a smile on his pale face.
7316,FATHER TIBER,"'Now yield thee,' cried Lars Porsena,"
7317,FATHER TIBER,'Now yield thee to our grace.'
7318,FATHER TIBER,
7319,FATHER TIBER,"Round turned he, as not deigning"
7320,FATHER TIBER,Those craven ranks to see;
7321,FATHER TIBER,"Nought spake he to Lars Porsena,"
7322,FATHER TIBER,To Sextus nought spake he;
7323,FATHER TIBER,But he saw on Palatinus
7324,FATHER TIBER,The white porch of his home;
7325,FATHER TIBER,And he spake to the noble river
7326,FATHER TIBER,That rolls by the towers of Rome.
7327,FATHER TIBER,
7328,FATHER TIBER,'O Tiber! father Tiber!
7329,FATHER TIBER,"To whom the Romans pray,"
7330,FATHER TIBER,"A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,"
7331,FATHER TIBER,Take thou in charge this day!'
7332,FATHER TIBER,"So he spake, and speaking sheathed"
7333,FATHER TIBER,"The good sword by his side,"
7334,FATHER TIBER,And with his harness on his back
7335,FATHER TIBER,Plunged headlong in the tide.
7336,FATHER TIBER,
7337,FATHER TIBER,No sound of joy or sorrow
7338,FATHER TIBER,Was heard from either bank;
7339,FATHER TIBER,"But friends and foes in dumb surprise,"
7340,FATHER TIBER,"With parted lips and straining eyes,"
7341,FATHER TIBER,Stood gazing where he sank;
7342,FATHER TIBER,And when above the surges
7343,FATHER TIBER,"They saw his crest appear,"
7344,FATHER TIBER,"All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,"
7345,FATHER TIBER,And even the ranks of Tuscany
7346,FATHER TIBER,Could scarce forbear to cheer.
7347,FATHER TIBER,
7348,FATHER TIBER,"But fiercely ran the current,"
7349,FATHER TIBER,Swollen high by months of rain:
7350,FATHER TIBER,And fast his blood was flowing;
7351,FATHER TIBER,"And he was sore in pain,"
7352,FATHER TIBER,"And heavy with his armour,"
7353,FATHER TIBER,And spent with changing blows:
7354,FATHER TIBER,"And oft they thought him sinking,"
7355,FATHER TIBER,But still again he rose.
7356,FATHER TIBER,
7357,FATHER TIBER,"Never, I ween, did swimmer,"
7358,FATHER TIBER,"In such an evil case,"
7359,FATHER TIBER,Struggle through such a raging flood
7360,FATHER TIBER,Safe to the landing-place:
7361,FATHER TIBER,But his limbs were borne up bravely
7362,FATHER TIBER,"By the brave heart within,"
7363,FATHER TIBER,And our good father Tiber
7364,FATHER TIBER,Bare bravely up his chin.
7365,FATHER TIBER,
7366,FATHER TIBER,'Curse on him!' quoth false Sextus;
7367,FATHER TIBER,'Will not the villain drown?
7368,FATHER TIBER,But for this stay ere close of day
7369,FATHER TIBER,We should have sacked the town!'
7370,FATHER TIBER,"'Heaven help him!' quoth Lars Porsena,"
7371,FATHER TIBER,'And bring him safe to shore;
7372,FATHER TIBER,For such a gallant feat of arms
7373,FATHER TIBER,Was never seen before.'
7374,FATHER TIBER,
7375,FATHER TIBER,And now he feels the bottom;
7376,FATHER TIBER,Now on dry earth he stands;
7377,FATHER TIBER,Now round him throng the Fathers
7378,FATHER TIBER,To press his gory hands;
7379,FATHER TIBER,"And now with shouts and clapping,"
7380,FATHER TIBER,"And noise of weeping loud,"
7381,FATHER TIBER,"He enters through the River-Gate,"
7382,FATHER TIBER,Borne by the joyous crowd.
7383,FATHER TIBER,
7384,FATHER TIBER,"They gave him of the corn-land,"
7385,FATHER TIBER,"That was of public right,"
7386,FATHER TIBER,As much as two strong oxen
7387,FATHER TIBER,Could plough from morn till night;
7388,FATHER TIBER,"And they made a molten image,"
7389,FATHER TIBER,"And set it up on high,"
7390,FATHER TIBER,And there it stands unto this day
7391,FATHER TIBER,To witness if I lie.
7392,FATHER TIBER,
7393,FATHER TIBER,It stands in the Comitium
7394,FATHER TIBER,Plain for all folk to see;
7395,FATHER TIBER,"Horatius in his harness,"
7396,FATHER TIBER,Halting upon one knee:
7397,FATHER TIBER,"And underneath is written,"
7398,FATHER TIBER,"In letters all of gold,"
7399,FATHER TIBER,How valiantly he kept the bridge
7400,FATHER TIBER,In the brave days of old.
7401,FATHER TIBER,
7402,FATHER TIBER,And still his name sounds stirring
7403,FATHER TIBER,"Unto the men of Rome,"
7404,FATHER TIBER,As the trumpet-blast that cries to them
7405,FATHER TIBER,To charge the Volscian home;
7406,FATHER TIBER,And wives still pray to Juno
7407,FATHER TIBER,For boys with hearts as bold
7408,FATHER TIBER,As his who kept the bridge so well
7409,FATHER TIBER,In the brave days of old.
7410,FATHER TIBER,
7411,FATHER TIBER,"And in the nights of winter,"
7412,FATHER TIBER,"When the cold north winds blow,"
7413,FATHER TIBER,And the long howling of the wolves
7414,FATHER TIBER,Is heard amidst the snow;
7415,FATHER TIBER,When round the lonely cottage
7416,FATHER TIBER,"Roars loud the tempest's din,"
7417,FATHER TIBER,And the good logs of Algidus
7418,FATHER TIBER,Roar louder yet within;
7419,FATHER TIBER,
7420,FATHER TIBER,"When the oldest cask is opened,"
7421,FATHER TIBER,And the largest lamp is lit;
7422,FATHER TIBER,"When the chestnuts glow in the embers,"
7423,FATHER TIBER,And the kid turns on the spit;
7424,FATHER TIBER,When young and old in circle
7425,FATHER TIBER,Around the firebrands close;
7426,FATHER TIBER,"When the girls are weaving baskets,"
7427,FATHER TIBER,And the lads are shaping bows;
7428,FATHER TIBER,
7429,FATHER TIBER,When the goodman mends his armour
7430,FATHER TIBER,And trims his helmet's plume;
7431,FATHER TIBER,When the goodwife's shuttle merrily
7432,FATHER TIBER,Goes flashing through the loom;
7433,FATHER TIBER,With weeping and with laughter
7434,FATHER TIBER,"Still is the story told,"
7435,FATHER TIBER,How well Horatius kept the bridge
7436,FATHER TIBER,In the brave days of old.

7451,THE ARMADA,"The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts of Spain."
7452,THE ARMADA,"It was about the lovely close of a warm summer day,"
7453,THE ARMADA,There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail to Plymouth Bay;
7454,THE ARMADA,"Her crew hath seen Castile's black fleet, beyond Aurigny's isle,"
7455,THE ARMADA,"At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile."
7456,THE ARMADA,"At sunrise she escaped their van, by God's especial grace;"
7457,THE ARMADA,"And the tall Pinta, till the noon, had held her close in chase."
7458,THE ARMADA,Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;
7459,THE ARMADA,The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe's lofty hall;
7460,THE ARMADA,"Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast,"
7461,THE ARMADA,And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post.
7462,THE ARMADA,"With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff comes;"
7463,THE ARMADA,Behind him march the halberdiers; before him sound the drums;
7464,THE ARMADA,His yeomen round the market cross make clear an ample space;
7465,THE ARMADA,For there behoves him to set up the standard of Her Grace.
7466,THE ARMADA,"And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells,"
7467,THE ARMADA,As slow upon the labouring wind the royal blazon swells.
7468,THE ARMADA,"Look how the Lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,"
7469,THE ARMADA,And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies down!
7470,THE ARMADA,"So stalked he when he turned to flight, on that famed Picard field,"

7472,THE ARMADA,"So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned to bay,"

7479,THE ARMADA,
7480,THE ARMADA,The freshening breeze of eve unfurled that banner's massy fold;
7481,THE ARMADA,The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty scroll of gold;
7482,THE ARMADA,"Night sank upon the dusky beach and on the purple sea,"
7483,THE ARMADA,"Such night in England ne'er had been, nor e'er again shall be."
7484,THE ARMADA,"From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,"
7485,THE ARMADA,That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day;
7486,THE ARMADA,"For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-flame spread,"
7487,THE ARMADA,High on St. Michael's Mount it shone: it shone on Beachy Head.
7488,THE ARMADA,"Far on the deep the Spaniard saw, along each southern shire,"
7489,THE ARMADA,"Cape beyond cape, in endless range, those twinkling points of fire."
7490,THE ARMADA,The fisher left his skiff to rock on Tamar's glittering waves:
7491,THE ARMADA,The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip's sunless caves!
7492,THE ARMADA,"O'er Longleat's towers, o'er Cranbourne's oaks, the fiery herald flew:"
7493,THE ARMADA,"He roused the shepherds of Stonehenge, the rangers of Beaulieu."
7494,THE ARMADA,"Right sharp and quick the bells all night rang out from Bristol town,"
7495,THE ARMADA,And ere the day three hundred horse had met on Clifton down;
7496,THE ARMADA,"The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night,"
7497,THE ARMADA,And saw o'erhanging Richmond Hill the streak of blood-red light:
7498,THE ARMADA,"Then bugle's note and cannon's roar the death-like silence broke,"
7499,THE ARMADA,"And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city woke."
7500,THE ARMADA,At once on all her stately gates arose the answering fires;
7501,THE ARMADA,At once the wild alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;
7502,THE ARMADA,From all the batteries of the Tower pealed loud the voice of fear;
7503,THE ARMADA,And all the thousand masts of Thames sent back a louder cheer;
7504,THE ARMADA,"And from the furthest wards was heard the rush of hurrying feet,"
7505,THE ARMADA,And the broad streams of pikes and flags rushed down each roaring street;
7506,THE ARMADA,"And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,"
7507,THE ARMADA,As fast from every village round the horse came spurring in.
7508,THE ARMADA,"And eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand went,"
7509,THE ARMADA,And roused in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent.
7510,THE ARMADA,Southward from Surrey's pleasant hills flew those bright couriers forth;
7511,THE ARMADA,High on bleak Hampstead's swarthy moor they started for the north;
7512,THE ARMADA,"And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still:"
7513,THE ARMADA,All night from tower to tower they sprang; they sprang from hill to hill:
7514,THE ARMADA,"Till the proud Peak unfurled the flag o'er Darwin's rocky dales,"
7515,THE ARMADA,"Till like volcanoes flared to heaven the stormy huts of Wales,"
7516,THE ARMADA,"Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern's lonely height,"

7518,THE ARMADA,"Till broad and fierce the star came forth on Ely's stately fane,"
7519,THE ARMADA,And tower and hamlet rose in arms o'er all the boundless plain;
7520,THE ARMADA,"Till Belvoir's lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,"
7521,THE ARMADA,And Lincoln sped the message on o'er the wide vale of Trent;
7522,THE ARMADA,"Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned on Gaunt's embattled pile,"
7523,THE ARMADA,And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle.

7741,THE BUILDERS,"The old man, in whose busy brain"
7742,THE BUILDERS,Many a ship that sailed the main

7748,THE BUILDERS,What the elder head had planned.
7749,THE BUILDERS,
7750,THE BUILDERS,"'Thus,' said he, 'will we build this ship!"
7751,THE BUILDERS,"Lay square the blocks upon the slip,"
7752,THE BUILDERS,And follow well this plan of mine.
7753,THE BUILDERS,Choose the timbers with greatest care;
7754,THE BUILDERS,Of all that is unsound beware;
7755,THE BUILDERS,For only what is sound and strong
7756,THE BUILDERS,To this vessel shall belong.
7757,THE BUILDERS,Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine
7758,THE BUILDERS,Here together shall combine.
7759,THE BUILDERS,"A goodly frame, and a goodly fame,"
7760,THE BUILDERS,And the UNION be her name!
7761,THE BUILDERS,For the day that gives her to the sea
7762,THE BUILDERS,Shall give my daughter unto thee!'
7763,THE BUILDERS,
7764,THE BUILDERS,The Master's word
7765,THE BUILDERS,EnrapturËd the young man heard;
7766,THE BUILDERS,"And as he turned his face aside,"
7767,THE BUILDERS,"With a look of joy and a thrill of pride,"
7768,THE BUILDERS,Standing before
7769,THE BUILDERS,"Her father's door,"
7770,THE BUILDERS,He saw the form of his promised bride.
7771,THE BUILDERS,"The sun shone on her golden hair,"
7772,THE BUILDERS,"And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,"
7773,THE BUILDERS,With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.
7774,THE BUILDERS,"Like a beauteous barge was she,"
7775,THE BUILDERS,"Still at rest on the sandy beach,"
7776,THE BUILDERS,Just beyond the billow's reach;
7777,THE BUILDERS,But he
7778,THE BUILDERS,"Was the restless, seething, stormy sea!"
7779,THE BUILDERS,
7780,THE BUILDERS,Ah! how skilful grows the hand
7781,THE BUILDERS,That obeyeth Love's command!
7782,THE BUILDERS,"It is the heart, and not the brain,"
7783,THE BUILDERS,"That to the highest doth attain,"
7784,THE BUILDERS,And he who followeth Love's behest
7785,THE BUILDERS,Far exceedeth all the rest!
7786,THE BUILDERS,Thus with the rising of the sun
7787,THE BUILDERS,"Was the noble task begun,"
7788,THE BUILDERS,And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds
7789,THE BUILDERS,Were heard the intermingled sounds
7790,THE BUILDERS,"Of axes and of mallets, plied"
7791,THE BUILDERS,With vigourous arms on every side;
7792,THE BUILDERS,"Plied so deftly and so well,"
7793,THE BUILDERS,"That ere the shadows of evening fell,"
7794,THE BUILDERS,"The keel of oak for a noble ship,"
7795,THE BUILDERS,"Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong,"
7796,THE BUILDERS,"Was lying ready, and stretched along"
7797,THE BUILDERS,"The blocks, well placed upon the slip."
7798,THE BUILDERS,"Happy, thrice happy, every one"
7799,THE BUILDERS,"Who sees his labour well begun,"
7800,THE BUILDERS,"And not perplexed and multiplied,"
7801,THE BUILDERS,By idly waiting for time and tide!
7802,THE BUILDERS,
7803,THE BUILDERS,"And when the hot, long day was o'er,"
7804,THE BUILDERS,The young man at the Master's door
7805,THE BUILDERS,Sat with the maiden calm and still.
7806,THE BUILDERS,"And within the porch, a little more"
7807,THE BUILDERS,"Removed beyond the evening chill,"
7808,THE BUILDERS,"The father sat, and told them tales"
7809,THE BUILDERS,"Of wrecks in the great September gales,"
7810,THE BUILDERS,"Of pirates upon the Spanish Main,"
7811,THE BUILDERS,And ships that never came back again;
7812,THE BUILDERS,"The chance and change of a sailor's life,"
7813,THE BUILDERS,"Want and plenty, rest and strife,"
7814,THE BUILDERS,"His roving fancy, like the wind,"
7815,THE BUILDERS,That nothing can stay and nothing can bind:
7816,THE BUILDERS,"And the magic charm of foreign lands,"
7817,THE BUILDERS,"With shadows of palms and shining sands,"
7818,THE BUILDERS,"Where the tumbling surf,"
7819,THE BUILDERS,"O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,"
7820,THE BUILDERS,"Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,"
7821,THE BUILDERS,As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.
7822,THE BUILDERS,
7823,THE BUILDERS,And the trembling maiden held her breath
7824,THE BUILDERS,"At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea,"
7825,THE BUILDERS,"With all its terror and mystery,"
7826,THE BUILDERS,"The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death,"
7827,THE BUILDERS,That divides and yet unites mankind!
7828,THE BUILDERS,"And whenever the old man paused, a gleam"
7829,THE BUILDERS,From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume
7830,THE BUILDERS,"The silent group in the twilight gloom,"
7831,THE BUILDERS,"And thoughtful faces, as in a dream;"
7832,THE BUILDERS,And for a moment one might mark
7833,THE BUILDERS,"What had been hidden by the dark,"
7834,THE BUILDERS,"That the head of the maiden lay at rest,"
7835,THE BUILDERS,"Tenderly, on the young man's breast!"

7838,IN THE SHIP-YARD,IN THE SHIP-YARD
7839,IN THE SHIP-YARD,

7841,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"With timbers fashioned strong and true,"
7842,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee,"
7843,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Till, framed with perfect symmetry,"
7844,IN THE SHIP-YARD,A skeleton ship rose up to view!
7845,IN THE SHIP-YARD,And round the bows and along the side
7846,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"The heavy hammers and mallets plied,"
7847,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Till after many a week, at length,"
7848,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Wonderful for form and strength,"
7849,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Sublime in its enormous bulk,"
7850,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!
7851,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing,"
7852,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething"
7853,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Caldron that glowed,"
7854,IN THE SHIP-YARD,And overflowed
7855,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"With the black tar, heated for the sheathing."
7856,IN THE SHIP-YARD,And amid the clamours
7857,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Of clattering hammers,"
7858,IN THE SHIP-YARD,He who listened heard now and then
7859,IN THE SHIP-YARD,The song of the Master and his men:--
7860,IN THE SHIP-YARD,
7861,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"'Build me straight, O worthy Master,"
7862,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel,"
7863,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"That shall laugh at all disaster,"
7864,IN THE SHIP-YARD,And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!'
7865,IN THE SHIP-YARD,
7866,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"With oaken brace and copper band,"
7867,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Lay the rudder on the sand,"
7868,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"That, like a thought, should have control"
7869,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Over the movement of the whole;
7870,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"And near it the anchor, whose giant hand"
7871,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Would reach down and grapple with the land,"
7872,IN THE SHIP-YARD,And immovable and fast
7873,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!
7874,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"And at the bows an image stood,"
7875,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"By a cunning artist carved in wood,"
7876,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"With robes of white, that far behind"
7877,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.
7878,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"It was not shaped in a classic mould,"
7879,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,"
7880,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Or Naiad rising from the water,"
7881,IN THE SHIP-YARD,But modelled from the Master's daughter!
7882,IN THE SHIP-YARD,On many a dreary and misty night
7883,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"'Twill be seen by the rays of the signal light,"
7884,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Speeding along through the rain and the dark,"
7885,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Like a ghost in its snow-white sark,"
7886,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"The pilot of some phantom bark,"
7887,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Guiding the vessel in its flight
7888,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"By a path none other knows aright,"
7889,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Behold, at last,"
7890,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Each tall and tapering mast
7891,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Is swung into its place;
7892,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Shrouds and stays
7893,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Holding it firm and fast!
7894,IN THE SHIP-YARD,
7895,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Long ago,"
7896,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"In the deer-haunted forests of Maine,"
7897,IN THE SHIP-YARD,When upon mountain and plain
7898,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Lay the snow,"
7899,IN THE SHIP-YARD,They fell--those lordly pines!
7900,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Those grand, majestic pines!"
7901,IN THE SHIP-YARD,'Mid shouts and cheers
7902,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"The jaded steers,"
7903,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Panting beneath the goad,"
7904,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Dragged down the weary, winding road"
7905,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Those captive kings so straight and tall,"
7906,IN THE SHIP-YARD,To be shorn of their streaming hair
7907,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"And, naked and bare,"
7908,IN THE SHIP-YARD,To feel the stress and the strain
7909,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Of the wind and the reeling main,"
7910,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Whose roar
7911,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Would remind them for evermore
7912,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Of their native forest they should not see again.
7913,IN THE SHIP-YARD,And everywhere
7914,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"The slender, graceful spars"
7915,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Poise aloft in the air,"
7916,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"And at the mast head,"
7917,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"White, blue, and red,"
7918,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"A flag unrolls the stripes and stars,"
7919,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,"
7920,IN THE SHIP-YARD,In foreign harbours shall behold
7921,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"That flag unrolled,"
7922,IN THE SHIP-YARD,'Twill be as a friendly hand
7923,IN THE SHIP-YARD,"Stretched out from his native land,"
7924,IN THE SHIP-YARD,Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless.
7925,IN THE SHIP-YARD,
7926,IN THE SHIP-YARD,
7927,THE TWO BRIDALS,THE TWO BRIDALS
7928,THE TWO BRIDALS,
7929,THE TWO BRIDALS,All is finished! and at length
7930,THE TWO BRIDALS,Has come the bridal day
7931,THE TWO BRIDALS,Of beauty and of strength.
7932,THE TWO BRIDALS,To-day the vessel shall be launched!
7933,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched,"
7934,THE TWO BRIDALS,"And o'er the bay,"
7935,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Slowly, in all his splendours dight,"
7936,THE TWO BRIDALS,The great sun rises to behold the sight.
7937,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The ocean old,"
7938,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Centuries old,"
7939,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,"
7940,THE TWO BRIDALS,Paces restless to and fro
7941,THE TWO BRIDALS,Up and down the sands of gold.
7942,THE TWO BRIDALS,His beating heart is not at rest;
7943,THE TWO BRIDALS,"And far and wide,"
7944,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With ceaseless flow,"
7945,THE TWO BRIDALS,His beard of snow
7946,THE TWO BRIDALS,Heaves with the heaving of his breast.
7947,THE TWO BRIDALS,
7948,THE TWO BRIDALS,He waits impatient for his bride.
7949,THE TWO BRIDALS,"There she stands,"
7950,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With her foot upon the sands,"
7951,THE TWO BRIDALS,Decked with flags and streamers gay
7952,THE TWO BRIDALS,"In honour of her marriage day,"
7953,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,"
7954,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Round her like a veil descending,"
7955,THE TWO BRIDALS,Ready to be
7956,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The bride of the grey, old sea."
7957,THE TWO BRIDALS,
7958,THE TWO BRIDALS,On the deck another bride
7959,THE TWO BRIDALS,Is standing by her lover's side.
7960,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Shadows from the flags and shrouds,"
7961,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Like the shadows cast by clouds,"
7962,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Broken by many a sunny fleck,"
7963,THE TWO BRIDALS,Fall around them on the deck.
7964,THE TWO BRIDALS,
7965,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The prayer is said,"
7966,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The service read,"
7967,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The joyous bridegroom bows his head,"
7968,THE TWO BRIDALS,And in tears the good old Master
7969,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Shakes the brown hand of his son,"
7970,THE TWO BRIDALS,Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek
7971,THE TWO BRIDALS,"In silence, for he cannot speak,"
7972,THE TWO BRIDALS,And ever faster
7973,THE TWO BRIDALS,Down his own the tears begin to run.
7974,THE TWO BRIDALS,The worthy pastor--
7975,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The shepherd of that wandering flock,"
7976,THE TWO BRIDALS,"That has the ocean for its wold,"
7977,THE TWO BRIDALS,"That has the vessel for its fold,"
7978,THE TWO BRIDALS,Leaping ever from rock to rock--
7979,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Spake, with accents mild and clear,"
7980,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Words of warning, words of cheer,"
7981,THE TWO BRIDALS,But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.
7982,THE TWO BRIDALS,"He knew the chart,"
7983,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Of the sailor's heart,"
7984,THE TWO BRIDALS,"All its pleasures and its griefs,"
7985,THE TWO BRIDALS,"All its shallows and rocky reefs,"
7986,THE TWO BRIDALS,All those secret currents that flow
7987,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With such resistless undertow,"
7988,THE TWO BRIDALS,"And lift and drift with terrible force,"
7989,THE TWO BRIDALS,The will from its moorings and its course.
7990,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Therefore he spake, and thus said he:"
7991,THE TWO BRIDALS,
7992,THE TWO BRIDALS,"'Like unto ships far off at sea,"
7993,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Outward or homeward bound, are we."
7994,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Before, behind, and all around,"
7995,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Floats and swings the horizon's bound,"
7996,THE TWO BRIDALS,Seems at its distant rim to rise
7997,THE TWO BRIDALS,"And climb the crystal wall of the skies,"
7998,THE TWO BRIDALS,"And then again to turn and sink,"
7999,THE TWO BRIDALS,As if we could slide from its outer brink.
8000,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Ah! it is not the sea,"
8001,THE TWO BRIDALS,"It is not the sea that sinks and shelves,"
8002,THE TWO BRIDALS,But ourselves
8003,THE TWO BRIDALS,That rock and rise
8004,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With endless and uneasy motion,"
8005,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Now touching the very skies,"
8006,THE TWO BRIDALS,Now sinking into the depths of ocean.
8007,THE TWO BRIDALS,Ah! if our souls but poise and swing
8008,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Like the compass in its brazen ring,"
8009,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Ever level, and ever true"
8010,THE TWO BRIDALS,"To the toil and the task we have to do,"
8011,THE TWO BRIDALS,"We shall sail securely, and safely reach"
8012,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach"
8013,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The sights we see, and the sounds we hear,"
8014,THE TWO BRIDALS,Will be those of joy and not of fear!'
8015,THE TWO BRIDALS,
8016,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Then the Master,"
8017,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With a gesture of command,"
8018,THE TWO BRIDALS,Waved his hand;
8019,THE TWO BRIDALS,"And at the word,"
8020,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Loud and sudden there was heard,"
8021,THE TWO BRIDALS,"All around them and below,"
8022,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The sound of hammers, blow on blow,"
8023,THE TWO BRIDALS,Knocking away the shores and spurs.
8024,THE TWO BRIDALS,And see! she stirs!
8025,THE TWO BRIDALS,She starts--she moves--she seems to feel
8026,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The thrill of life along her keel,"
8027,THE TWO BRIDALS,"And, spurning with her foot the ground,"
8028,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With one exulting, joyous bound,"
8029,THE TWO BRIDALS,She leaps into the ocean's arms!
8030,THE TWO BRIDALS,And lo! from the assembled crowd
8031,THE TWO BRIDALS,"There rose a shout, prolonged and loud,"
8032,THE TWO BRIDALS,"That to the ocean seemed to say,--"
8033,THE TWO BRIDALS,"'Take her, O bridegroom, old and grey,"
8034,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Take her to thy protecting arms,"
8035,THE TWO BRIDALS,With all her youth and all her charms!'
8036,THE TWO BRIDALS,
8037,THE TWO BRIDALS,How beautiful she is! How fair
8038,THE TWO BRIDALS,"She lies within those arms, that press"
8039,THE TWO BRIDALS,Her form with many a soft caress
8040,THE TWO BRIDALS,Of tenderness and watchful care!
8041,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Sail forth into the sea, O ship!"
8042,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Through wind and wave, right onward steer!"
8043,THE TWO BRIDALS,"The moistened eye, the trembling lip,"
8044,THE TWO BRIDALS,Are not the signs of doubt or fear.
8045,THE TWO BRIDALS,
8046,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Sail forth into the sea of life,"
8047,THE TWO BRIDALS,"O gentle, loving, trusting wife,"
8048,THE TWO BRIDALS,And safe from all adversity
8049,THE TWO BRIDALS,Upon the bosom of that sea
8050,THE TWO BRIDALS,Thy comings and thy goings be!
8051,THE TWO BRIDALS,For gentleness and love and trust
8052,THE TWO BRIDALS,Prevail o'er angry wave and gust;
8053,THE TWO BRIDALS,And in the wreck of noble lives
8054,THE TWO BRIDALS,Something immortal still survives!
8055,THE TWO BRIDALS,
8056,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Thou, too, sail on, O ship of State!"
8057,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Sail on, O Union, strong and great!"
8058,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Humanity with all its fears,"
8059,THE TWO BRIDALS,"With all the hopes of future years,"
8060,THE TWO BRIDALS,Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
8061,THE TWO BRIDALS,"We know what Master laid thy keel,"
8062,THE TWO BRIDALS,"What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,"
8063,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,"
8064,THE TWO BRIDALS,"What anvils rang, what hammers beat,"
8065,THE TWO BRIDALS,In what a forge and what a heat
8066,THE TWO BRIDALS,Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!
8067,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Fear not each sudden sound and shock,"
8068,THE TWO BRIDALS,'Tis of the wave and not the rock;
8069,THE TWO BRIDALS,"'Tis but the flapping of the sail,"
8070,THE TWO BRIDALS,And not a rent made by the gale!
8071,THE TWO BRIDALS,"In spite of rock and tempest's roar,"
8072,THE TWO BRIDALS,"In spite of false lights on the shore,"
8073,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!"
8074,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,"
8075,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,"
8076,THE TWO BRIDALS,"Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,"

8087,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8088,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8089,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Othere, the old sea-captain,"
8090,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Who dwelt in Helgoland,"
8091,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"To King Alfred, the Lover of Truth,"
8092,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Brought a snow-white walrus-tooth,"
8093,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Which he held in his brown right hand.
8094,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8095,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"His figure was tall and stately,"
8096,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Like a boy's his eye appeared;
8097,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"His hair was yellow as hay,"
8098,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,But threads of a silvery grey
8099,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Gleamed in his tawny beard.
8100,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8101,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Hearty and hale was Othere,"
8102,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,His cheek had the colour of oak;
8103,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"With a kind of laugh in his speech,"
8104,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Like the sea-tide on a beach,"
8105,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,As unto the king he spoke.
8106,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8107,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And Alfred, King of the Saxons,"
8108,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Had a book upon his knees,"
8109,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And wrote down the wondrous tale
8110,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Of him who was first to sail
8111,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Into the Arctic seas.
8112,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8113,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"'So far I live to the northward,"
8114,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,No man lives north of me;
8115,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"To the east are wild mountain-chains,"
8116,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And beyond them meres and plains;
8117,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,To the westward all is sea.
8118,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8119,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"So far I live to the northward,"
8120,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"From the harbour of Skeringes-hale,"
8121,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,If you only sailed by day
8122,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"With a fair wind all the way,"
8123,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,More than a month would you sail.
8124,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8125,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"I own six hundred reindeer,"
8126,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,With sheep and swine beside;
8127,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"I have tribute from the Finns,"
8128,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Whalebone and reindeer-skins,"
8129,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And ropes of walrus-hide.
8130,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8131,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"I ploughed the land with horses,"
8132,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"But my heart was ill at ease,"
8133,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,For the old seafaring men
8134,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Came to me now and then,"
8135,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,With their sagas of the seas;--
8136,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8137,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Of Iceland and of Greenland,"
8138,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And the stormy Hebrides,"
8139,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And the undiscovered deep;--
8140,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,I could not eat nor sleep
8141,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,For thinking of those seas.
8142,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8143,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"To the northward stretched the desert,"
8144,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,How far I fain would know;
8145,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"So at last I sallied forth,"
8146,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And three days sailed due north,"
8147,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,As far as the whale-ships go.
8148,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8149,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"To the west of me was the ocean,"
8150,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"To the right the desolate shore,"
8151,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,But I did not slacken sail
8152,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"For the walrus or the whale,"
8153,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Till after three days more.
8154,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8155,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"The days grew longer and longer,"
8156,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Till they became as one,"
8157,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And southward through the haze
8158,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,I saw the sullen blaze
8159,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Of the red midnight sun.
8160,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8161,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And then uprose before me,"
8162,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Upon the water's edge,"
8163,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,The huge and haggard shape
8164,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Of that unknown North Cape,"
8165,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Whose form is like a wedge.
8166,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8167,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"The sea was rough and stormy,"
8168,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"The tempest howled and wailed,"
8169,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And the sea-fog, like a ghost,"
8170,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Haunted that dreary coast,"
8171,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,But onward still I sailed.
8172,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8173,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Four days I steered to eastward,"
8174,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Four days without a night:
8175,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Round in a fiery ring
8176,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Went the great sun, O King,"
8177,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,With red and lurid light.'
8178,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8179,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Here Alfred, King of the Saxons,"
8180,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Ceased writing for a while;
8181,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And raised his eyes from his book,"
8182,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"With a strange and puzzled look,"
8183,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And an incredulous smile.
8184,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8185,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"But Othere, the old sea-captain,"
8186,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"He neither paused nor stirred,"
8187,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Till the King listened, and then"
8188,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Once more took up his pen,"
8189,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And wrote down every word.
8190,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8191,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"'And now the land,' said Othere,"
8192,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"'Bent southward suddenly,"
8193,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And I followed the curving shore,"
8194,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And ever southward bore
8195,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Into a nameless sea.
8196,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8197,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And there we hunted the walrus,"
8198,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"The narwhale, and the seal;"
8199,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Ha! 'twas a noble game!
8200,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And like the lightning's flame
8201,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Flew our harpoons of steel.
8202,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8203,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"There were six of us all together,"
8204,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Norsemen of Helgoland;
8205,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,In two days and no more
8206,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"We killed of them threescore,"
8207,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,And dragged them to the strand.'
8208,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8209,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Here Alfred, the Truth-Teller,"
8210,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Suddenly closed his book,"
8211,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And lifted his blue eyes,"
8212,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,With doubt and strange surmise
8213,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Depicted in their look.
8214,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8215,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And Othere, the old sea-captain,"
8216,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Stared at him wild and weird,"
8217,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Then smiled till his shining teeth
8218,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,Gleamed white from underneath
8219,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"His tawny, quivering beard."
8220,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,
8221,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"And to the King of the Saxons,"
8222,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"In witness of the truth,"
8223,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"Raising his noble head,"
8224,THE DISCOVERER OF THE NORTH CAPE,"He stretched his brown hand, and said,"

8393,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8394,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"Over the mountains winding down,"

8401,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"Of noon looked down, and saw not one."
8402,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8403,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,"
8404,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;
8405,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8406,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"Bravest of all in Frederick town,"
8407,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,She took up the flag the men hauled down;
8408,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8409,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"In her attic window the staff she set,"
8410,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,To show that one heart was loyal yet.
8411,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8412,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"Up the street came the rebel tread,"
8413,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
8414,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8415,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,Under his slouched hat left and right
8416,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,He glanced; the old flag met his sight.
8417,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8418,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,'Halt!'--the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
8419,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,'Fire!'--out blazed the rifle-blast.
8420,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8421,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"It shivered the window, pane and sash;"
8422,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,It rent the banner with seam and gash.
8423,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8424,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff"
8425,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;
8426,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,

8428,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,And shook it forth with a royal will.
8429,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,
8430,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"'Shoot, if you must, this old grey head,"

8433,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,"A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,"

8446,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,Over the heads of the rebel host.
8447,BARBARA FRIETCHIE,

8462,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8463,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8464,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,"
8465,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And a pinnace, like a fluttered bird, came flying from far away:"
8466,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,'Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!'
8467,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: ''Fore God I am no coward;
8468,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,"
8469,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick."
8470,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?'
8471,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8472,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: 'I know you are no coward;
8473,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.
8474,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.
8475,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,"
8476,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain.'
8477,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8478,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"So Lord Howard passed away with five ships of war that day,"
8479,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;
8480,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But Sir Richard bore in hand all the sick men from the land
8481,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Very carefully and slow,"
8482,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Men of Bideford in Devon,"
8483,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And we laid them on the ballast down below;
8484,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For we brought them all aboard,"
8485,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,"
8486,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord."
8487,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8488,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,"
8489,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,"
8490,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.
8491,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,'Shall we fight or shall we fly?
8492,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Good Sir Richard, tell us now,"
8493,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,For to fight is but to die!
8494,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set.'
8495,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And Sir Richard said again: 'We be all good English men.
8496,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Let us bang those dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,"
8497,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,For I never turned my back upon Don or devil yet.'
8498,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8499,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so"
8500,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,"
8501,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;"
8502,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For half their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,"
8503,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the little Revenge ran on through the long sea-lane between.
8504,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8505,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laughed,"
8506,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft
8507,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Running on and on, till delayed"
8508,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons,"
8509,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,"
8510,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Took the breath from our sails, and we stayed."
8511,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8512,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And while now the great San Philip hung above us like a cloud
8513,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Whence the thunderbolt will fall
8514,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Long and loud,"
8515,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Four galleons drew away
8516,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"From the Spanish fleet that day,"
8517,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,"
8518,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the battle thunder broke from them all.
8519,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8520,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But anon the great San Philip, she bethought herself and went,"
8521,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;
8522,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,"
8523,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,"
8524,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears
8525,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,When he leaps from the water to the land.
8526,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8527,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,"
8528,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.
8529,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,"
8530,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;"
8531,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her"
8532,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,shame.
8533,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For some were sunk and many were shattered, and so could fight us no"
8534,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,more--
8535,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?"
8536,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8537,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"For he said, 'Fight on! fight on!'"
8538,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Though his vessel was all but a wreck;
8539,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,"
8540,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,"
8541,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,"
8542,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,"
8543,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And he said, 'Fight on! fight on!'"
8544,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8545,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the night went down and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,"
8546,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;
8547,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But they dared not touch us again, for they feared that we still could"
8548,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"sting,"
8549,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,So they watched what the end would be.
8550,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And we had not fought them in vain,"
8551,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But in perilous plight were we,"
8552,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,"
8553,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And half of the rest of us maimed for life
8554,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;
8555,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,"
8556,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it"
8557,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,spent;
8558,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;
8559,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8560,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,But Sir Richard cried in his English pride:
8561,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,'We have fought such a fight for a day and a night
8562,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,As may never be fought again!
8563,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"We have won great glory, my men!"
8564,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And a day less or more
8565,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"At sea or ashore,"
8566,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,We die--does it matter when?
8567,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Sink me the ship, Master Gunner--sink her, split her in twain!"
8568,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!'"
8569,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8570,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the gunner said, 'Ay, ay,' but the seamen made reply:"
8571,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"'We have children, we have wives,"
8572,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the Lord hath spared our lives.
8573,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;"
8574,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow.'
8575,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe."
8576,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8577,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,"
8578,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,"
8579,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;
8580,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:"
8581,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,'I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;
8582,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do:
8583,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!'
8584,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And he fell upon their decks and he died.
8585,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,
8586,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,"
8587,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap
8588,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;
8589,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,"
8590,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"But they sank his body with honour down into the deep,"
8591,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And they manned the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,"
8592,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And away she sailed with her loss and longed for her own;
8593,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"When a wind from the lands they had ruined awoke from sleep,"
8594,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,"
8595,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,"
8596,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,"
8597,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their
8598,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"flags,"
8599,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,"And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shattered navy of Spain,"
8600,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags
8601,A BALLAD OF THE FLEET,To be lost evermore in the main.

8660,THE HEAVY BRIGADE,
8661,THE HEAVY BRIGADE,'Lost one and all' were the words

8726,THE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS,"With knee to man unbent,"
8727,THE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS,"Unfaltering on its dreadful brink,"
8728,THE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS,To his red grave he went.
8729,THE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS,
8730,THE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS,"Vain, mightiest fleets of iron frames;"

8734,THE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS,"So, let his name through Europe ring--"

8753,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Slain; but of foes that guarded
8754,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Their rock-built fortress well,"
8755,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Some twenty had been mastered,"
8756,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,When the last soldier fell.
8757,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8758,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Whilst Napier piloted his wondrous way

8760,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Then flashed at once, on each fierce clan, dismay,"
8761,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Lord of their wild Truckee.

8771,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Let Eblis blast for ever

8781,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Pierced through each Indian glen;

8784,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8785,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Still, when a chief dies bravely,"
8786,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,We bind with green _one_ wrist--
8787,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Green for the brave, for heroes"
8788,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,ONE crimson thread we twist.

8798,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8799,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Thus conquering hate, and steadfast to the right,"
8800,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Fresh from the heart that haughty verdict came;
8801,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Beneath a waning moon, each spectral height"
8802,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Rolled back its loud acclaim.
8803,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8804,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Once more the chief gazed keenly
8805,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Down on those daring dead;
8806,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,From his good sword their heart's blood
8807,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Crept to that crimson thread.
8808,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Once more he cried, 'The judgment,"

8812,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,

8816,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Nor did they look for gold.
8817,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,To them their leader's signal
8818,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Was as the voice of God:
8819,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Unmoved, and uncomplaining,"
8820,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,The path it showed they trod.
8821,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8822,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"As, without sound or struggle,"
8823,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"The stars unhurrying march,"
8824,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Where Allah's finger guides them,"
8825,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Through yonder purple arch,"
8826,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"These Franks, sublimely silent,"
8827,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Without a quickened breath,"
8828,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Went in the strength of duty
8829,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Straight to their goal of death.
8830,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8831,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,'If I were now to ask you
8832,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"To name our bravest man,"
8833,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Ye all at once would answer,"
8834,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,They called him Mehrab Khan.
8835,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"He sleeps among his fathers,"
8836,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Dear to our native land,"
8837,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,With the bright mark he bled for
8838,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Firm round his faithful hand.
8839,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8840,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,'The songs they sing of Rustum
8841,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Fill all the past with light;
8842,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"If truth be in their music,"
8843,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,He was a noble knight.
8844,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,But were those heroes living
8845,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"And strong for battle still,"
8846,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Would Mehrab Khan or Rustum
8847,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Have climbed, like these, the hill?'"
8848,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8849,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"And they replied, 'Though Mehrab Khan was brave,"
8850,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"As chief, he chose himself what risks to run;"
8851,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Prince Rustum lied, his forfeit life to save,"
8852,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Which these had never done.'
8853,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8854,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,'Enough!' he shouted fiercely;
8855,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"'Doomed though they be to hell,"
8856,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Bind fast the crimson trophy
8857,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Round BOTH wrists--bind it well.
8858,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Who knows but that great Allah

8862,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8863,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Then all those gallant robbers
8864,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Shouted a stern 'Amen!'
8865,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"They raised the slaughtered sergeant,"
8866,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,They raised his mangled ten.
8867,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,And when we found their bodies
8868,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Left bleaching in the wind,"
8869,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,Around BOTH wrists in glory
8870,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,That crimson thread was twined.
8871,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,
8872,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Then Napier's knightly heart, touched to the core,"
8873,THE RED THREAD OF HONOUR,"Rung, like an echo, to that knightly deed,"

8905,HERV… RIEL,"On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two,"
8906,HERV… RIEL,"Did the English fight the French,--woe to France!"
8907,HERV… RIEL,"And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter thro' the blue,"
8908,HERV… RIEL,"Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue,"
8909,HERV… RIEL,"Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Rance,"
8910,HERV… RIEL,With the English fleet in view.
8911,HERV… RIEL,
8912,HERV… RIEL,"'Twas the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase;"
8913,HERV… RIEL,"First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville;"
8914,HERV… RIEL,"Close on him fled, great and small,"
8915,HERV… RIEL,Twenty-two good ships in all;
8916,HERV… RIEL,And they signalled to the place
8917,HERV… RIEL,'Help the winners of a race!
8918,HERV… RIEL,"Get us guidance, give us harbour, take us quick--or, quicker still,"
8919,HERV… RIEL,Here's the English can and will!'
8920,HERV… RIEL,
8921,HERV… RIEL,Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board;
8922,HERV… RIEL,"'Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?' laughed they:"
8923,HERV… RIEL,"'Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,"
8924,HERV… RIEL,Shall the _Formidable_ here with her twelve and eighty guns
8925,HERV… RIEL,"Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way,"
8926,HERV… RIEL,"Trust to enter where 'tis ticklish for a craft of twenty tons,"
8927,HERV… RIEL,And with flow at full beside?
8928,HERV… RIEL,"Now, 'tis slackest ebb of tide."
8929,HERV… RIEL,"Reach the mooring? Rather say,"
8930,HERV… RIEL,"While rock stands or water runs,"
8931,HERV… RIEL,Not a ship will leave the bay!'
8932,HERV… RIEL,
8933,HERV… RIEL,Then was called a council straight.
8934,HERV… RIEL,Brief and bitter the debate:
8935,HERV… RIEL,'Here's the English at our heels; would you have them take in tow
8936,HERV… RIEL,"All that's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow,"
8937,HERV… RIEL,For a prize to Plymouth Sound?
8938,HERV… RIEL,Better run the ships aground!'
8939,HERV… RIEL,(Ended Damfreville his speech).
8940,HERV… RIEL,Not a minute more to wait!
8941,HERV… RIEL,'Let the Captains all and each
8942,HERV… RIEL,"Shove ashore, then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach!"
8943,HERV… RIEL,France must undergo her fate.
8944,HERV… RIEL,
8945,HERV… RIEL,Give the word!' But no such word
8946,HERV… RIEL,Was ever spoke or heard;
8947,HERV… RIEL,"For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these"
8948,HERV… RIEL,"--A Captain? A Lieutenant? A Mate--first, second, third?"
8949,HERV… RIEL,"No such man of mark, and meet"
8950,HERV… RIEL,With his betters to compete!
8951,HERV… RIEL,"But a simple Breton sailor pressed by Tourville for the fleet,"
8952,HERV… RIEL,"A poor coasting-pilot he, HervÈ Riel the Croisickese."
8953,HERV… RIEL,
8954,HERV… RIEL,"And, 'What mockery or malice have we here?' cries HervÈ Riel:"
8955,HERV… RIEL,"'Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues?"
8956,HERV… RIEL,"Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell"
8957,HERV… RIEL,"On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell"
8958,HERV… RIEL,'Twixt the offing here and GrËve where the river disembogues?
8959,HERV… RIEL,Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying's for?
8960,HERV… RIEL,"Morn and eve, night and day,"
8961,HERV… RIEL,"Have I piloted your bay,"
8962,HERV… RIEL,Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor.
8963,HERV… RIEL,
8964,HERV… RIEL,Burn the fleet and ruin France? That were worse than fifty Hogues!
8965,HERV… RIEL,"Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there's a way!"
8966,HERV… RIEL,"Only let me lead the line,"
8967,HERV… RIEL,"Have the biggest ship to steer,"
8968,HERV… RIEL,"Get this _Formidable_ clear,"
8969,HERV… RIEL,"Make the others follow mine,"
8970,HERV… RIEL,"And I lead them, most and least, by a passage I know well,"
8971,HERV… RIEL,"Right to Solidor past GrËve,"
8972,HERV… RIEL,And there lay them safe and sound;
8973,HERV… RIEL,"And if one ship misbehave,"
8974,HERV… RIEL,"--Keel so much as grate the ground,"
8975,HERV… RIEL,"Why, I've nothing but my life,--here's my head!' cries HervÈ Riel."
8976,HERV… RIEL,
8977,HERV… RIEL,Not a minute more to wait.
8978,HERV… RIEL,"'Steer us in, then, small and great!"
8979,HERV… RIEL,"Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!' cried his chief."
8980,HERV… RIEL,"'Captains, give the sailor place!"
8981,HERV… RIEL,"He is Admiral, in brief.'"
8982,HERV… RIEL,"Still the north-wind, by God's grace!"
8983,HERV… RIEL,"See the noble fellow's face,"
8984,HERV… RIEL,"As the big ship with a bound,"
8985,HERV… RIEL,"Clears the entry like a hound,"
8986,HERV… RIEL,Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide seas profound!
8987,HERV… RIEL,"See, safe thro' shoal and rock,"
8988,HERV… RIEL,"How they follow in a flock,"
8989,HERV… RIEL,"Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,"
8990,HERV… RIEL,Not a spar that comes to grief!
8991,HERV… RIEL,"The peril, see, is past,"
8992,HERV… RIEL,"All are harboured to the last,"
8993,HERV… RIEL,And just as HervÈ Riel hollas 'Anchor!'--sure as fate
8994,HERV… RIEL,"Up the English come, too late!"
8995,HERV… RIEL,
8996,HERV… RIEL,"So, the storm subsides to calm:"
8997,HERV… RIEL,They see the green trees wave
8998,HERV… RIEL,On the o'erlooking GrËve.
8999,HERV… RIEL,Hearts that bled are stanched with balm.
9000,HERV… RIEL,"'Just our rapture to enhance,"
9001,HERV… RIEL,"Let the English take the bay,"
9002,HERV… RIEL,"Gnash their teeth and glare askance,"
9003,HERV… RIEL,As they cannonade away!
9004,HERV… RIEL,'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Rance!'
9005,HERV… RIEL,How hope succeeds despair on each Captain's countenance!
9006,HERV… RIEL,"Out burst all with one accord,"
9007,HERV… RIEL,'This is Paradise for Hell!
9008,HERV… RIEL,"Let France, let France's King"
9009,HERV… RIEL,Thank the man that did the thing!'
9010,HERV… RIEL,"What a shout, and all one word,"
9011,HERV… RIEL,'HervÈ Riel!'
9012,HERV… RIEL,"As he stepped in front once more,"
9013,HERV… RIEL,Not a symptom of surprise
9014,HERV… RIEL,"In the frank blue Breton eyes,"
9015,HERV… RIEL,Just the same man as before.
9016,HERV… RIEL,
9017,HERV… RIEL,"Then said Damfreville, 'My friend,"
9018,HERV… RIEL,"I must speak out at the end,"
9019,HERV… RIEL,Though I find the speaking hard.
9020,HERV… RIEL,Praise is deeper than the lips:
9021,HERV… RIEL,"You have saved the King his ships,"
9022,HERV… RIEL,You must name your own reward.
9023,HERV… RIEL,'Faith our sun was near eclipse!
9024,HERV… RIEL,"Demand whate'er you will,"
9025,HERV… RIEL,France remains your debtor still.
9026,HERV… RIEL,Ask to heart's content and have! or my name's not Damfreville.'
9027,HERV… RIEL,
9028,HERV… RIEL,Then a beam of fun outbroke
9029,HERV… RIEL,"On the bearded mouth that spoke,"
9030,HERV… RIEL,As the honest heart laughed through
9031,HERV… RIEL,Those frank eyes of Breton blue:
9032,HERV… RIEL,"'Since I needs must say my say,"
9033,HERV… RIEL,"Since on board the duty's done,"
9034,HERV… RIEL,"And from Malo Roads to Croisic Point, what is it but a run?--"
9035,HERV… RIEL,"Since 'tis ask and have, I may--"
9036,HERV… RIEL,Since the others go ashore--
9037,HERV… RIEL,Come! A good whole holiday!
9038,HERV… RIEL,"Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!'"
9039,HERV… RIEL,"That he asked and that he got,--nothing more."
9040,HERV… RIEL,
9041,HERV… RIEL,Name and deed alike are lost:
9042,HERV… RIEL,Not a pillar nor a post
9043,HERV… RIEL,In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell;
9044,HERV… RIEL,Not a head in white and black
9045,HERV… RIEL,"On a single fishing smack,"
9046,HERV… RIEL,In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack
9047,HERV… RIEL,All that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell.
9048,HERV… RIEL,Go to Paris: rank on rank
9049,HERV… RIEL,Search the heroes flung pell-mell
9050,HERV… RIEL,"On the Louvre, face and flank!"
9051,HERV… RIEL,You shall look long enough ere you come to HervÈ Riel.
9052,HERV… RIEL,"So, for better and for worse,"
9053,HERV… RIEL,"HervÈ Riel, accept my verse!"
9054,HERV… RIEL,"In my verse, HervÈ Riel, do thou once more"

9517,THE DUEL,And in a sandy whirlwind wrapped the pair.
9518,THE DUEL,"In gloom they twain were wrapped, and they alone;"
9519,THE DUEL,For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
9520,THE DUEL,"Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,"
9521,THE DUEL,And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.
9522,THE DUEL,"But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes"
9523,THE DUEL,And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield
9524,THE DUEL,Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear
9525,THE DUEL,"Rent the tough plates, but failed to reach the skin,"
9526,THE DUEL,And Rustum plucked it back with angry groan.
9527,THE DUEL,"Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,"
9528,THE DUEL,Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest
9529,THE DUEL,"He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,"
9530,THE DUEL,"Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;"
9531,THE DUEL,And Rustum bowed his head; but then the gloom
9532,THE DUEL,"Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,"
9533,THE DUEL,"And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,"
9534,THE DUEL,"Who stood at hand, uttered a dreadful cry;--"
9535,THE DUEL,"No horse's cry was that, most like the roar"
9536,THE DUEL,"Of some pained desert-lion, who all day"
9537,THE DUEL,"Hath trailed the hunter's javelin in his side,"
9538,THE DUEL,And comes at night to die upon the sand.
9539,THE DUEL,"The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,"
9540,THE DUEL,And Oxus curdled as it crossed his stream.
9541,THE DUEL,"But Sohrab heard, and quailed not, but rushed on,"
9542,THE DUEL,And struck again; and again Rustum bowed
9543,THE DUEL,"His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,"
9544,THE DUEL,"Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,"
9545,THE DUEL,And in the hand the hilt remained alone.
9546,THE DUEL,Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes
9547,THE DUEL,"Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,"
9548,THE DUEL,"And shouted: _Rustum!_--Sohrab heard that shout,"
9549,THE DUEL,"And shrank amazed; back he recoiled one step,"
9550,THE DUEL,And scanned with blinking eyes the advancing form;
9551,THE DUEL,And then he stood bewildered; and he dropped
9552,THE DUEL,"His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side."
9553,THE DUEL,"He reeled, and staggering back, sank to the ground;"
9554,THE DUEL,"And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,"
9555,THE DUEL,"And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all"
9556,THE DUEL,The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair--
9557,THE DUEL,"Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,"
9558,THE DUEL,"And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand."
9559,THE DUEL,
9560,THE DUEL,
9561,SOHRAB,SOHRAB
9562,SOHRAB,
9563,SOHRAB,"Then with a bitter smile, Rustum began:--"
9564,SOHRAB,"'Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill"
9565,SOHRAB,"A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,"
9566,SOHRAB,And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.
9567,SOHRAB,Or else that the great Rustum would come down
9568,SOHRAB,"Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move"
9569,SOHRAB,"His heart to take a gift, and let thee go."
9570,SOHRAB,And then that all the Tartar host would praise
9571,SOHRAB,"Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,"
9572,SOHRAB,To glad thy father in his weak old age.
9573,SOHRAB,"Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!"
9574,SOHRAB,Dearer to the red jackels shalt thou be
9575,SOHRAB,"Than to thy friends, and to thy father old,'"
9576,SOHRAB,"And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:--"
9577,SOHRAB,'Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.
9578,SOHRAB,"Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!"
9579,SOHRAB,"No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart."
9580,SOHRAB,"For were I matched with ten such men as thee,"
9581,SOHRAB,"And I were that which till to-day I was,"
9582,SOHRAB,"They should be lying here, I standing there."
9583,SOHRAB,But that beloved name unnerved my arm--
9584,SOHRAB,"That name, and something, I confess, in thee,"
9585,SOHRAB,"Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield"
9586,SOHRAB,Fall; and thy spear transfix an unarmed foe.
9587,SOHRAB,"And now thou boastest, and insultest my fate."
9588,SOHRAB,"But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:"
9589,SOHRAB,The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!
9590,SOHRAB,"My father, whom I seek through all the world,"
9591,SOHRAB,"He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!'"
9592,SOHRAB,As when some hunter in the spring hath found
9593,SOHRAB,"A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,"
9594,SOHRAB,"Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,"
9595,SOHRAB,"And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,"
9596,SOHRAB,And followed her to find her where she fell
9597,SOHRAB,Far off;--anon her mate comes winging back
9598,SOHRAB,"From hunting, and a great way off decries"
9599,SOHRAB,His huddling young left-sole; at that he checks
9600,SOHRAB,"His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps"
9601,SOHRAB,"Circles above his eyry, with loud screams"
9602,SOHRAB,Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she
9603,SOHRAB,"Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,"
9604,SOHRAB,"In some far stony gorge out of his ken,"
9605,SOHRAB,A heap of fluttering feathers--never more
9606,SOHRAB,"Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;"
9607,SOHRAB,Never the black and dripping precipices
9608,SOHRAB,Echo her stormy scream as she sails by--
9609,SOHRAB,"As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,"
9610,SOHRAB,"So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood"
9611,SOHRAB,"Over his dying son, and knew him not."
9612,SOHRAB,"But, with a cold, incredulous voice he said:"
9613,SOHRAB,'What prate is this of fathers and revenge?
9614,SOHRAB,The mighty Rustum never had a son.'
9615,SOHRAB,And with a failing voice Sohrab replied:
9616,SOHRAB,"'Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I,"
9617,SOHRAB,"Surely the news will one day reach his ear,"
9618,SOHRAB,"Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,"
9619,SOHRAB,"Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;"
9620,SOHRAB,"And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap"
9621,SOHRAB,"To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee."
9622,SOHRAB,"Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!"
9623,SOHRAB,"What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?"
9624,SOHRAB,"O could I live, till I that grief had seen!"
9625,SOHRAB,"Yet him I pity not so much, but her,"
9626,SOHRAB,"My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells"
9627,SOHRAB,"With that old king, her father, who grows grey"
9628,SOHRAB,"With age, and rules over the valiant Koords."
9629,SOHRAB,"Her most I pity, who no more will see"
9630,SOHRAB,"Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,"
9631,SOHRAB,"With spoils and honour, when the war is done."
9632,SOHRAB,"But a dark rumour will be bruited up,"
9633,SOHRAB,"From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;"
9634,SOHRAB,And then will that defenceless woman learn
9635,SOHRAB,"That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,"
9636,SOHRAB,"But that in battle with a nameless foe,"
9637,SOHRAB,"By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.'"
9638,SOHRAB,
9639,SOHRAB,
9640,THE RECOGNITION,THE RECOGNITION
9641,THE RECOGNITION,
9642,THE RECOGNITION,"He spoke, and as he ceased he wept aloud,"
9643,THE RECOGNITION,"Thinking of her he left, and his own death."
9644,THE RECOGNITION,He spoke; but Rustum listened plunged in thought.
9645,THE RECOGNITION,Nor did he yet believe it was his son
9646,THE RECOGNITION,"Who spoke, although he called back names he knew;"
9647,THE RECOGNITION,"For he had had sure tidings that the babe,"
9648,THE RECOGNITION,"Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,"
9649,THE RECOGNITION,"Had been a puny girl, no boy at all--"
9650,THE RECOGNITION,"So that sad mother sent him word, for fear"
9651,THE RECOGNITION,"Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms."
9652,THE RECOGNITION,"And as he deemed that either Sohrab took,"
9653,THE RECOGNITION,"By a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;"
9654,THE RECOGNITION,"Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame."
9655,THE RECOGNITION,So deemed he; yet he listened plunged in thought;
9656,THE RECOGNITION,"And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide"
9657,THE RECOGNITION,Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore
9658,THE RECOGNITION,At the full moon; tears gathered in his eyes;
9659,THE RECOGNITION,"For he remembered his own early youth,"
9660,THE RECOGNITION,"And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,"
9661,THE RECOGNITION,The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
9662,THE RECOGNITION,"A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,"
9663,THE RECOGNITION,Through many rolling clouds--so Rustum saw
9664,THE RECOGNITION,"His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;"
9665,THE RECOGNITION,"And that old king, her father, who loved well"
9666,THE RECOGNITION,"His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child"
9667,THE RECOGNITION,"With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,"
9668,THE RECOGNITION,"They three, in that long-distant summer-time--"
9669,THE RECOGNITION,"The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt"
9670,THE RECOGNITION,"And hound, and morn on those delightful hills"
9671,THE RECOGNITION,"In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,"
9672,THE RECOGNITION,"Of age and looks to be his own dear son,"
9673,THE RECOGNITION,"Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,"
9674,THE RECOGNITION,Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe
9675,THE RECOGNITION,"Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,"
9676,THE RECOGNITION,"Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,"
9677,THE RECOGNITION,"And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,"
9678,THE RECOGNITION,"On the mown, dying grass--so Sohrab lay,"
9679,THE RECOGNITION,"Lovely in death, upon the common sand."
9680,THE RECOGNITION,"And Rustum gazed on him in grief, and said:"
9681,THE RECOGNITION,"'O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son"
9682,THE RECOGNITION,"Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved:"
9683,THE RECOGNITION,"Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men"
9684,THE RECOGNITION,Have told thee false--thou art not Rustum's son.
9685,THE RECOGNITION,For Rustum had no son; one child he had--
9686,THE RECOGNITION,But one--a girl; who with her mother now
9687,THE RECOGNITION,"Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us--"
9688,THE RECOGNITION,"Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.'"
9689,THE RECOGNITION,But Sohrab answered him in wrath; for now
9690,THE RECOGNITION,"The anguish of the deep-fixed spear grew fierce,"
9691,THE RECOGNITION,"And he desirËd to draw forth the steel,"
9692,THE RECOGNITION,"And let the blood flow free, and so to die--"
9693,THE RECOGNITION,But first he would convince his stubborn foe;
9694,THE RECOGNITION,"And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:"
9695,THE RECOGNITION,"'Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?"
9696,THE RECOGNITION,"Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,"
9697,THE RECOGNITION,"And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine."
9698,THE RECOGNITION,"I tell thee, pricked upon this arm I bear"
9699,THE RECOGNITION,"That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,"
9700,THE RECOGNITION,That she might prick it on the babe she bore.'
9701,THE RECOGNITION,"He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,"
9702,THE RECOGNITION,"And his knees tottered, and he smote his hand"
9703,THE RECOGNITION,"Against his breast, his heavy mailËd hand,"
9704,THE RECOGNITION,That the hard iron corselet clanked aloud;
9705,THE RECOGNITION,"And to his heart he pressed the other hand,"
9706,THE RECOGNITION,And in a hollow voice he spake and said:
9707,THE RECOGNITION,"'Sohrab, that were a proof that could not lie!"
9708,THE RECOGNITION,"If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son.'"
9709,THE RECOGNITION,Then with weak hasty fingers Sohrab loosed
9710,THE RECOGNITION,"His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,"
9711,THE RECOGNITION,And showed a sign in faint vermilion points
9712,THE RECOGNITION,"Pricked; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,"
9713,THE RECOGNITION,"Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,"
9714,THE RECOGNITION,"An emperor's gift--at early morn he paints,"
9715,THE RECOGNITION,"And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp"
9716,THE RECOGNITION,Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands--
9717,THE RECOGNITION,So delicately pricked the sign appeared
9718,THE RECOGNITION,"On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal."
9719,THE RECOGNITION,"It was that griffin, which of old reared Zal,"
9720,THE RECOGNITION,"Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,"
9721,THE RECOGNITION,"A helpless babe, among the mountain rocks;"
9722,THE RECOGNITION,"Him that kind creature found, and reared, and loved--"
9723,THE RECOGNITION,Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.
9724,THE RECOGNITION,"And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,"
9725,THE RECOGNITION,"And himself scanned it long with mournful eyes,"
9726,THE RECOGNITION,And then he touched it with his hand and said:--
9727,THE RECOGNITION,'How sayest thou? Is that sign the proper sign
9728,THE RECOGNITION,"Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?'"
9729,THE RECOGNITION,
9730,THE RECOGNITION,
9731,RUKSH THE HORSE,RUKSH THE HORSE
9732,RUKSH THE HORSE,
9733,RUKSH THE HORSE,"He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood"
9734,RUKSH THE HORSE,Speechless; and then he uttered one sharp cry:
9735,RUKSH THE HORSE,_O boy--thy father!_--and his voice choked there.
9736,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And then a dark cloud passed before his eyes,"
9737,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And his head swam, and he sank down to earth."
9738,RUKSH THE HORSE,"But Sohrab crawled to where he lay, and cast"
9739,RUKSH THE HORSE,"His arms about his neck, and kissed his lips,"
9740,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,"
9741,RUKSH THE HORSE,Trying to call him back to life; and life
9742,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,"
9743,RUKSH THE HORSE,And they stood wide with horror; and he seized
9744,RUKSH THE HORSE,"In both his hands the dust which lay around,"
9745,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And threw it on his head, and smirched his hair,--"
9746,RUKSH THE HORSE,"His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;"
9747,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,"
9748,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And his sobs choked him; and he clutched his sword,"
9749,RUKSH THE HORSE,"To draw it, and for ever let life out."
9750,RUKSH THE HORSE,"But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,"
9751,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:"
9752,RUKSH THE HORSE,"'Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day"
9753,RUKSH THE HORSE,The doom which at my birth was written down
9754,RUKSH THE HORSE,"In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand."
9755,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,"
9756,RUKSH THE HORSE,"When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,"
9757,RUKSH THE HORSE,I know it! but fate trod these promptings down
9758,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged"
9759,RUKSH THE HORSE,"The strife, and hurled me on my father's spear."
9760,RUKSH THE HORSE,But let us speak no more of this! I find
9761,RUKSH THE HORSE,My father; let me feel that I have found!
9762,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take"
9763,RUKSH THE HORSE,"My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,"
9764,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And wash them with thy tears, and say: _My son!_"
9765,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Quick! quick! for numbered are my sands of life,"
9766,RUKSH THE HORSE,And swift; for like the lightning to this field
9767,RUKSH THE HORSE,"I came, and like the wind I go away--"
9768,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind."
9769,RUKSH THE HORSE,But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.'
9770,RUKSH THE HORSE,"So said he, and his voice released the heart"
9771,RUKSH THE HORSE,Of Rustum and his tears broke forth; he cast
9772,RUKSH THE HORSE,"His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,"
9773,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And kissed him. And awe fell on both the hosts,"
9774,RUKSH THE HORSE,"When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh the horse,"
9775,RUKSH THE HORSE,With his head bowing to the ground and mane
9776,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe"
9777,RUKSH THE HORSE,"First to the one, then to the other moved"
9778,RUKSH THE HORSE,"His head, as if inquiring what their grief"
9779,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,"
9780,RUKSH THE HORSE,"The big warm tears rolled down, and caked the sand."
9781,RUKSH THE HORSE,"But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:--"
9782,RUKSH THE HORSE,"'Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet"
9783,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,"
9784,RUKSH THE HORSE,Or ere they brought thy master to this field!'
9785,RUKSH THE HORSE,But Sohrab looked upon the horse and said:
9786,RUKSH THE HORSE,"'Is this, then, Ruksh? How often in past days,"
9787,RUKSH THE HORSE,"My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,"
9788,RUKSH THE HORSE,"My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,"
9789,RUKSH THE HORSE,That I should one day find thy lord and thee.
9790,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!"
9791,RUKSH THE HORSE,"O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;"
9792,RUKSH THE HORSE,"For thou hast gone where I shall never go,"
9793,RUKSH THE HORSE,And snuffed the breezes of my father's home.
9794,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,"
9795,RUKSH THE HORSE,"And seen the river of Helmund, and the Lake"
9796,RUKSH THE HORSE,Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself
9797,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,"
9798,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Corn in a golden platter soaked with wine,"
9799,RUKSH THE HORSE,And said: _O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!_--but I
9800,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Have never known my grandsire's furrowed face,"
9801,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,"
9802,RUKSH THE HORSE,Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;
9803,RUKSH THE HORSE,"But lodged among my father's foes, and seen"
9804,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,"
9805,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,"
9806,RUKSH THE HORSE,And the black Toorkman tents; and only drunk
9807,RUKSH THE HORSE,"The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,"
9808,RUKSH THE HORSE,"Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,"
9809,RUKSH THE HORSE,"The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,"
9810,RUKSH THE HORSE,"The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.'"
9811,RUKSH THE HORSE,
9812,RUKSH THE HORSE,
9813,RUSTUM,RUSTUM
9814,RUSTUM,
9815,RUSTUM,"Then with a heavy groan, Rustum bewailed:"
9816,RUSTUM,'O that its waves were flowing over me!
9817,RUSTUM,O that I saw its grains of yellow silt
9818,RUSTUM,Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!'
9819,RUSTUM,"But with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:--"
9820,RUSTUM,"'Desire not that, my father! thou must live."
9821,RUSTUM,"For some are born to do great deeds, and live,"
9822,RUSTUM,"As some are born to be obscured, and die."
9823,RUSTUM,"Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,"
9824,RUSTUM,And reap a second glory in thine age;
9825,RUSTUM,"Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine."
9826,RUSTUM,But come! thou seest this great host of men
9827,RUSTUM,"Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!"
9828,RUSTUM,Let me entreat for them; what have they done?
9829,RUSTUM,"They followed me, my hope, my fame, my star."
9830,RUSTUM,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.
9831,RUSTUM,"But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,"
9832,RUSTUM,"But carry me with thee to Seistan,"
9833,RUSTUM,"And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,"
9834,RUSTUM,"Thou, and the snow-haired Zal, and all thy friends."
9835,RUSTUM,"And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,"
9836,RUSTUM,"And heap a stately mound above my bones,"
9837,RUSTUM,And plant a far-seen pillar over all.
9838,RUSTUM,That so the passing horseman on the waste
9839,RUSTUM,"May see my tomb a great way off, and cry;"
9840,RUSTUM,"_Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies here,"
9841,RUSTUM,Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!_
9842,RUSTUM,And I be not forgotten in my grave.'
9843,RUSTUM,"And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:"
9844,RUSTUM,"'Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,"
9845,RUSTUM,"So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,"
9846,RUSTUM,"And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,"
9847,RUSTUM,"And carry thee away to Seistan,"
9848,RUSTUM,"And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,"
9849,RUSTUM,"With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends."
9850,RUSTUM,"And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,"
9851,RUSTUM,"And heap a stately mound above thy bones,"
9852,RUSTUM,"And plant a far-seen pillar over all,"
9853,RUSTUM,And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.
9854,RUSTUM,"And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!"
9855,RUSTUM,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!
9856,RUSTUM,What should I do with slaying any more?
9857,RUSTUM,For would that all whom I have ever slain
9858,RUSTUM,"Might be once more alive--my bitterest foes,"
9859,RUSTUM,"And they who were called champions in their time,"
9860,RUSTUM,And through whose death I won that fame I have--
9861,RUSTUM,"And I were nothing but a common man,"
9862,RUSTUM,"A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,"
9863,RUSTUM,"So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!"
9864,RUSTUM,"Or rather would that I, even I myself,"
9865,RUSTUM,"Might now be lying on this bloody sand,"
9866,RUSTUM,"Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,"
9867,RUSTUM,"Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;"
9868,RUSTUM,"And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;"
9869,RUSTUM,"And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;"
9870,RUSTUM,"And say: _O Son, I weep thee not too sore,"
9871,RUSTUM,"For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!_"
9872,RUSTUM,"But now in blood and battles was my youth,"
9873,RUSTUM,"And full of blood and battles is my age,"
9874,RUSTUM,And I shall never end this life of blood.'
9875,RUSTUM,"Then at the point of death, Sohrab replied:"
9876,RUSTUM,"'A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!"
9877,RUSTUM,"But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,"
9878,RUSTUM,"Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,"
9879,RUSTUM,"When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,"
9880,RUSTUM,Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo
9881,RUSTUM,"Returning home over the salt blue sea,"
9882,RUSTUM,From laying thy dear master in his grave.'
9883,RUSTUM,
9884,RUSTUM,
9885,NIGHT,NIGHT
9886,NIGHT,
9887,NIGHT,"And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:"
9888,NIGHT,"'Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!"
9889,NIGHT,"Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure.'"
9890,NIGHT,"He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took"
9891,NIGHT,"The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased"
9892,NIGHT,His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood
9893,NIGHT,"Came welling from the open gash, and life"
9894,NIGHT,Flowed with the stream;--all down his cold white side
9895,NIGHT,"The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soiled,"
9896,NIGHT,Like the soiled tissue of white violets
9897,NIGHT,"Left, freshly gathered, on their native bank,"
9898,NIGHT,By children whom their nurses call with haste
9899,NIGHT,"Indoors from the sun's eye; his head dropped low,"
9900,NIGHT,"His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay--"
9901,NIGHT,"White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,"
9902,NIGHT,"Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,"
9903,NIGHT,"Convulsed him back to life, he opened them,"
9904,NIGHT,And fixed them feebly on his father's face;
9905,NIGHT,"Till now all strength was ebbed, and from his limbs"
9906,NIGHT,"Unwillingly the spirit fled away,"
9907,NIGHT,"Regretting the warm mansion which it left,"
9908,NIGHT,"And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world."
9909,NIGHT,"So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;"
9910,NIGHT,And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak
9911,NIGHT,"Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son."
9912,NIGHT,As those black granite pillars once high-reared
9913,NIGHT,"By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear"
9914,NIGHT,"His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps"
9915,NIGHT,"Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side,"
9916,NIGHT,So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.
9917,NIGHT,"And night came down over the solemn waste,"
9918,NIGHT,"And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,"
9919,NIGHT,"And darkened all; and a cold fog, with night,"
9920,NIGHT,"Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,"
9921,NIGHT,"As of a great assembly loosed, and fires"
9922,NIGHT,Began to twinkle through the fog; for now
9923,NIGHT,"Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;"
9924,NIGHT,The Persians took it on the open sands
9925,NIGHT,"Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;"
9926,NIGHT,And Rustum and his son were left alone.
9927,NIGHT,"But the majestic river floated on,"
9928,NIGHT,"Out of the mist and hum of that low land,"
9929,NIGHT,"Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,"
9930,NIGHT,"Rejoicing, through the hushed Chorasmian waste,"
9931,NIGHT,Under the solitary moon;--he flowed
9932,NIGHT,"Right for the polar star, past OrgunjË,"
9933,NIGHT,"Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin"
9934,NIGHT,"To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,"
9935,NIGHT,And split his currents; that for many a league
9936,NIGHT,The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along
9937,NIGHT,Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles--
9938,NIGHT,"Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had"
9939,NIGHT,In his high mountain cradle in Pamere
9940,NIGHT,A foiled circuitous wanderer--till at last
9941,NIGHT,"The longed-for dash of waves is heard, and wide"
9942,NIGHT,"His luminous home of waters opens, bright"
9943,NIGHT,"And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars"
9944,NIGHT,"Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea."

10077,THE TWO CAPTAINS,THE TWO CAPTAINS
10078,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10079,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10080,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"When George the Third was reigning a hundred years ago,"
10081,THE TWO CAPTAINS,He ordered Captain Farmer to chase the foreign foe.
10082,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"'You're not afraid of shot,' said he, 'you're not afraid of wreck,"
10083,THE TWO CAPTAINS,So cruise about the west of France in the frigate called _Quebec_.
10084,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10085,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Quebec was once a Frenchman's town, but twenty years ago"
10086,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"King George the Second sent a man called General Wolfe, you know,"
10087,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"To clamber up a precipice and look into Quebec,"
10088,THE TWO CAPTAINS,As you'd look down a hatchway when standing on the deck.
10089,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10090,THE TWO CAPTAINS,If Wolfe could beat the Frenchmen then so you can beat them now.
10091,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Before he got inside the town he died, I must allow."
10092,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"But since the town was won for us it is a lucky name,"
10093,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"And you'll remember Wolfe's good work, and you shall do the same.'"
10094,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10095,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Then Farmer said, 'I'll try, sir,' and Farmer bowed so low"
10096,THE TWO CAPTAINS,That George could see his pigtail tied in a velvet bow.
10097,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"George gave him his commission, and that it might be safer,"
10098,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Signed 'King of Britain, King of France,' and sealed it with a wafer."
10099,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10100,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Then proud was Captain Farmer in a frigate of his own,"
10101,THE TWO CAPTAINS,And grander on his quarter-deck than George upon the throne.
10102,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"He'd two guns in his cabin, and on the spar-deck ten,"
10103,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"And twenty on the gun-deck, and more than ten score men."
10104,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10105,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"And as a huntsman scours the brakes with sixteen brace of dogs,"
10106,THE TWO CAPTAINS,With two-and-thirty cannon the ship explored the fogs.
10107,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"From Cape la Hogue to Ushant, from Rochefort to Belleisle,"
10108,THE TWO CAPTAINS,She hunted game till reef and mud were rubbing on her keel.
10109,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10110,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"The fogs are dried, the frigate's side is bright with melting tar,"
10111,THE TWO CAPTAINS,The lad up in the foretop sees square white sails afar;
10112,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"The east wind drives three square-sailed masts from out the Breton bay,"
10113,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"And 'Clear for action!' Farmer shouts, and reefers yell 'Hooray!'"
10114,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10115,THE TWO CAPTAINS,The Frenchman's captain had a name I wish I could pronounce;
10116,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"A Breton gentleman was he, and wholly free from bounce,"
10117,THE TWO CAPTAINS,One like those famous fellows who died by guillotine
10118,THE TWO CAPTAINS,For honour and the fleurs-de-lys and Antoinette the Queen.
10119,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10120,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"The Catholic for Louis, the Protestant for George,"
10121,THE TWO CAPTAINS,Each captain drew as bright a sword as saintly smiths could forge;
10122,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"And both were simple seamen, but both could understand"
10123,THE TWO CAPTAINS,How each was bound to win or die for flag and native land.
10124,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10125,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"The French ship was _la Surveillante_, which means the watchful maid;"
10126,THE TWO CAPTAINS,She folded up her head-dress and began to cannonade.
10127,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Her hull was clean, and ours was foul; we had to spread more sail."
10128,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"On canvas, stays, and topsail yards her bullets came like hail."
10129,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10130,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Sore smitten were both captains, and many lads beside,"
10131,THE TWO CAPTAINS,And still to cut our rigging the foreign gunners tried.
10132,THE TWO CAPTAINS,A sail-clad spar came flapping down athwart a blazing gun;
10133,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"We could not quench the rushing flames, and so the Frenchman won."
10134,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10135,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Our quarter-deck was crowded, the waist was all aglow;"
10136,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Men hung upon the taffrail half scorched, but loth to go;"
10137,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Our captain sat where once he stood, and would not quit his chair."
10138,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"He bade his comrades leap for life, and leave him bleeding there."
10139,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10140,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"The guns were hushed on either side, the Frenchmen lowered boats,"
10141,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"They flung us planks and hencoops, and everything that floats."
10142,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"They risked their lives, good fellows! to bring their rivals aid."
10143,THE TWO CAPTAINS,'Twas by the conflagration the peace was strangely made.
10144,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10145,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"_La Surveillante_ was like a sieve; the victors had no rest,"
10146,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"They had to dodge the east wind to reach the port of Brest,"
10147,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"And where the waves leapt lower, and the riddled ship went slower,"
10148,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"In triumph, yet in funeral guise, came fisher-boats to tow her."
10149,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10150,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead;"
10151,THE TWO CAPTAINS,And as the wounded captives passed each Breton bowed the head.
10152,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Then spoke the French Lieutenant, ''Twas fire that won, not we."
10153,THE TWO CAPTAINS,You never struck your flag to us; you'll go to England free.'
10154,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10155,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"'Twas the sixth day of October, seventeen hundred seventy-nine,"
10156,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"A year when nations ventured against us to combine,"
10157,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"_Quebec_ was burnt and Farmer slain, by us remembered not;"
10158,THE TWO CAPTAINS,But thanks be to the French book wherein they're not forgot.
10159,THE TWO CAPTAINS,
10160,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Now you, if you've to fight the French, my youngster, bear in mind"
10161,THE TWO CAPTAINS,Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;
10162,THE TWO CAPTAINS,"Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to Brest,"
10163,THE TWO CAPTAINS,And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a guest.

10290,HOGNI,
10291,HOGNI,Ye shall know that in Atli's feast-hall on the side that joined the house
10292,HOGNI,Were many carven doorways whose work was glorious
10293,HOGNI,"With marble stones and gold-work, and their doors of beaten brass:"
10294,HOGNI,"Lo now, in the merry morning how the story cometh to pass!"
10295,HOGNI,"--While the echoes of the trumpet yet fill the people's ears,"
10296,HOGNI,"And Hogni casts by the war-horn, and his Dwarf-wrought sword uprears,"
10297,HOGNI,"All those doors aforesaid open, and in pour the streams of steel,"
10298,HOGNI,"The best of the Eastland champions, the bold men of Atli's weal:"
10299,HOGNI,"They raise no cry of battle nor cast forth threat of woe,"
10300,HOGNI,And their helmed and hidden faces from each other none may know:
10301,HOGNI,"Then a light in the hall ariseth, and the fire of battle runs"
10302,HOGNI,All adown the front of the Niblungs in the face of the mighty ones;
10303,HOGNI,"All eyes are set upon them, hard drawn is every breath,"
10304,HOGNI,Ere the foremost points be mingled and death be blent with death.
10305,HOGNI,"--All eyes save the eyes of Hogni; but e'en as the edges meet,"
10306,HOGNI,"He turneth about for a moment to the gold of the kingly seat,"
10307,HOGNI,"Then aback to the front of battle; there then, as the lightning-flash"
10308,HOGNI,"Through the dark night showeth the city when the clouds of heaven clash,"
10309,HOGNI,"And the gazer shrinketh backward, yet he seeth from end to end"
10310,HOGNI,"The street and the merry market, and the windows of his friend,"
10311,HOGNI,"And the pavement where his footsteps yester'en returning trod,"
10312,HOGNI,Now white and changed and dreadful 'neath the threatening voice of God;
10313,HOGNI,"So Hogni seeth Gudrun, and the face he used to know,"
10314,HOGNI,"Unspeakable, unchanging, with white unknitted brow"
10315,HOGNI,"With half-closed lips untrembling, with deedless hands and cold"
10316,HOGNI,"Laid still on knees that stir not, and the linen's moveless fold."
10317,HOGNI,
10318,HOGNI,"Turned Hogni unto the spear-wall, and smote from where he stood,"
10319,HOGNI,And hewed with his sword two-handed as the axe-man in a wood:
10320,HOGNI,"Before his sword was a champion, and the edges clave to the chin,"
10321,HOGNI,And the first man fell in the feast-hall of those that should fall
10322,HOGNI,therein.
10323,HOGNI,"Then man with man was dealing, and the Niblung host of war"
10324,HOGNI,"Was swept by the leaping iron, as the rock anigh the shore"
10325,HOGNI,By the ice-cold waves of winter: yet a moment Gunnar stayed
10326,HOGNI,As high in his hand unblooded he shook his awful blade;
10327,HOGNI,"And he cried: 'O Eastland champions, do ye behold it here,"
10328,HOGNI,"The sword of the ancient Giuki? Fall on and have no fear,"
10329,HOGNI,"But slay and be slain and be famous, if your master's will it be!"
10330,HOGNI,"Yet are we the blameless Niblungs, and bidden guests are we:"
10331,HOGNI,"So forbear, if ye wander hood-winked, nor for nothing slay and be slain;"
10332,HOGNI,For I know not what to tell you of the dead that live again.'
10333,HOGNI,
10334,HOGNI,"So he saith in the midst of the foemen with his war-flame reared on high,"
10335,HOGNI,But all about and around him goes up a bitter cry
10336,HOGNI,"From the iron men of Atli, and the bickering of the steel"
10337,HOGNI,"Sends a roar up to the roof-ridge, and the Niblung war-ranks reel"
10338,HOGNI,"Behind the steadfast Gunnar: but lo! have ye seen the corn,"
10339,HOGNI,"While yet men grind the sickle, by the wind-streak overborne"
10340,HOGNI,"When the sudden rain sweeps downward, and summer groweth black,"
10341,HOGNI,And the smitten wood-side roareth 'neath the driving thunder-wrack?
10342,HOGNI,"So before the wise-heart Hogni shrank the champions of the East,"
10343,HOGNI,As his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of Atli's feast.
10344,HOGNI,"There he smote, and beheld not the smitten, and by nought were his edges"
10345,HOGNI,stopped;
10346,HOGNI,"He smote, and the dead were thrust from him; a hand with its shield he"
10347,HOGNI,lopped;
10348,HOGNI,"There met him Atli's marshal, and his arm at the shoulder he shred;"
10349,HOGNI,Three swords were upreared against him of the best of the kin of the
10350,HOGNI,dead;
10351,HOGNI,"And he struck off a head to the rightward, and his sword through a throat"
10352,HOGNI,"he thrust,"
10353,HOGNI,"But the third stroke fell on his helm-crest, and he stooped to the ruddy"
10354,HOGNI,"dust,"
10355,HOGNI,"And uprose as the ancient Giant, and both his hands were wet:"
10356,HOGNI,"Red then was the world to his eyen, as his hand to the labour he set;"
10357,HOGNI,"Swords shook and fell in his pathway, huge bodies leapt and fell,"
10358,HOGNI,"Harsh grided shield and war-helm like the tempest-smitten bell,"
10359,HOGNI,"And the war-cries ran together, and no man his brother knew,"
10360,HOGNI,"And the dead men loaded the living, as he went the war-wood through;"
10361,HOGNI,"And man 'gainst man was huddled, till no sword rose to smite,"
10362,HOGNI,"And clear stood the glorious Hogni in an island of the fight,"
10363,HOGNI,"And there ran a river of death 'twixt the Niblung and his foes,"
10364,HOGNI,And therefrom the terror of men and the wrath of the Gods arose.

10368,GUNNAR,
10369,GUNNAR,"Now fell the sword of Gunnar, and rose up red in the air,"
10370,GUNNAR,"And hearkened the song of the Niblung, as his voice rang glad and clear,"
10371,GUNNAR,"And rejoiced and leapt at the Eastmen, and cried as it met the rings"
10372,GUNNAR,Of a Giant of King Atli and a murder-wolf of kings;
10373,GUNNAR,"But it quenched its thirst in his entrails, and knew the heart in his"
10374,GUNNAR,"breast,"
10375,GUNNAR,"And hearkened the praise of Gunnar, and lingered not to rest,"
10376,GUNNAR,"But fell upon Atli's brother, and stayed not in his brain;"
10377,GUNNAR,"Then he fell, and the King leapt over, and clave a neck atwain,"
10378,GUNNAR,"And leapt o'er the sweep of a pole-axe, and thrust a lord in the throat,"
10379,GUNNAR,And King Atli's banner-bearer through shield and hauberk smote;
10380,GUNNAR,"Then he laughed on the huddled East-folk, and against their war-shields"
10381,GUNNAR,drave
10382,GUNNAR,"While the white swords tossed about him, and that archer's skull he clave"
10383,GUNNAR,Whom Atli had bought in the Southlands for many a pound of gold;
10384,GUNNAR,"And the dark-skinned fell upon Gunnar, and over his war-shield rolled,"
10385,GUNNAR,"And cumbered his sword for a season, and the many blades fell on,"
10386,GUNNAR,"And sheared the cloudy helm-crest and rents in his hauberk won,"
10387,GUNNAR,"And the red blood ran from Gunnar; till that Giuki's sword outburst,"
10388,GUNNAR,"As the fire-tongue from the smoulder that the leafy heap hath nursed,"
10389,GUNNAR,"And unshielded smote King Gunnar, and sent the Niblung song"
10390,GUNNAR,Through the quaking stems of battle in the hall of Atli's wrong:
10391,GUNNAR,"Then he rent the knitted war-hedge till by Hogni's side he stood,"
10392,GUNNAR,"And kissed him amidst of the spear-hail, and their cheeks were wet with"
10393,GUNNAR,blood.
10394,GUNNAR,
10395,GUNNAR,"Then on came the Niblung bucklers, and they drave the East-folk home,"
10396,GUNNAR,As the bows of the oar-driven long-ship beat off the waves in foam:
10397,GUNNAR,"They leave their dead behind them, and they come to the doors and the"
10398,GUNNAR,"wall,"
10399,GUNNAR,And a few last spears from the fleeing amidst their shield-hedge fall:
10400,GUNNAR,"But the doors clash to in their faces, as the fleeing rout they drive,"
10401,GUNNAR,And fain would follow after; and none is left alive
10402,GUNNAR,"In the feast-hall of King Atli, save those fishes of the net,"
10403,GUNNAR,And the white and silent woman above the slaughter set.
10404,GUNNAR,
10405,GUNNAR,"Then biddeth the heart-wise Hogni, and men to the windows climb,"
10406,GUNNAR,"And uplift the war-grey corpses, dead drift of the stormy time,"
10407,GUNNAR,And cast them adown to their people: thence they come aback and say
10408,GUNNAR,"That scarce shall ye see the houses, and no whit the wheel-worn way"
10409,GUNNAR,For the spears and shields of the Eastlands that the merchant city
10410,GUNNAR,throng;
10411,GUNNAR,And back to the Niblung burg-gate the way seemed weary-long.
10412,GUNNAR,
10413,GUNNAR,"Yet passeth hour on hour, and the doors they watch and ward"
10414,GUNNAR,"But a long while hear no mail-clash, nor the ringing of the sword;"
10415,GUNNAR,"Then droop the Niblung children, and their wounds are waxen chill,"
10416,GUNNAR,"And they think of the burg by the river, and the builded holy hill,"
10417,GUNNAR,And their eyes are set on Gudrun as of men who would beseech;
10418,GUNNAR,"But unlearned are they in craving, and know not dastard's speech."
10419,GUNNAR,"Then doth Giuki's first-begotten a deed most fair to be told,"
10420,GUNNAR,"For his fair harp Gunnar taketh, and the warp of silver and gold;"
10421,GUNNAR,"With the hand of a cunning harper he dealeth with the strings,"
10422,GUNNAR,"And his voice in their midst goeth upward, as of ancient days he sings,"
10423,GUNNAR,"Of the days before the Niblungs, and the days that shall be yet;"
10424,GUNNAR,"Till the hour of toil and smiting the warrior hearts forget,"
10425,GUNNAR,"Nor hear the gathering foemen, nor the sound of swords aloof:"
10426,GUNNAR,"Then clear the song of Gunnar goes up to the dusky roof,"
10427,GUNNAR,"And the coming spear-host tarries, and the bearers of the woe"
10428,GUNNAR,Through the cloisters of King Atli with lingering footsteps go.
10429,GUNNAR,
10430,GUNNAR,"But Hogni looketh on Gudrun, and no change in her face he sees,"
10431,GUNNAR,And no stir in her folded linen and the deedless hands on her knees:
10432,GUNNAR,"Then from Gunnar's side he hasteneth; and lo! the open door,"
10433,GUNNAR,"And a foeman treadeth the pavement, and his lips are on Atli's floor,"
10434,GUNNAR,"For Hogni is death in the doorway: then the Niblungs turn on the foe,"
10435,GUNNAR,"And the hosts are mingled together, and blow cries out on blow."
10436,GUNNAR,
10437,GUNNAR,
10438,GUDRUN,GUDRUN
10439,GUDRUN,
10440,GUDRUN,"Still the song goeth up from Gunnar, though his harp to earth be laid;"
10441,GUDRUN,"But he fighteth exceeding wisely, and is many a warrior's aid,"
10442,GUDRUN,"And he shieldeth and delivereth, and his eyes search through the hall,"
10443,GUDRUN,"And woe is he for his fellows, as his battle-brethren fall;"
10444,GUDRUN,"For the turmoil hideth little from that glorious folk-king's eyes,"
10445,GUDRUN,"And o'er all he beholdeth Gudrun, and his soul is waxen wise,"
10446,GUDRUN,"And he saith: 'We shall look on Sigurd, and Sigmund of old days,"
10447,GUDRUN,And see the boughs of the Branstock o'er the ancient Volsung's praise.'
10448,GUDRUN,
10449,GUDRUN,Woe's me for the wrath of Hogni! From the door he giveth aback
10450,GUDRUN,That the Eastland slayers may enter to the murder and the wrack:
10451,GUDRUN,"Then he rageth and driveth the battle to the golden kingly seat,"
10452,GUDRUN,"And the last of the foes he slayeth by Gudrun's very feet,"
10453,GUDRUN,That the red blood splasheth her raiment; and his own blood therewithal
10454,GUDRUN,"He casteth aloft before her, and the drops on her white hands fall:"
10455,GUDRUN,"But nought she seeth or heedeth, and again he turns to fight,"
10456,GUDRUN,Nor heedeth stroke nor wounding so he a foe may smite:
10457,GUDRUN,"Then the battle opens before him, and the Niblungs draw to his side;"
10458,GUDRUN,"As death in the world first fashioned, through the feast-hall doth he"
10459,GUDRUN,stride.
10460,GUDRUN,And so once more do the Niblungs sweep that murder-flood of men
10461,GUDRUN,"From the hall of toils and treason, and the doors swing to again."
10462,GUDRUN,Then again is there peace for a little within the fateful fold;
10463,GUDRUN,"But the Niblungs look about them, and but few folk they behold"
10464,GUDRUN,"Upright on their feet for the battle: now they climb aloft no more,"
10465,GUDRUN,"Nor cast the dead from the windows; but they raise a rampart of war,"
10466,GUDRUN,"And its stones are the fallen East-folk, and no lowly wall is that."
10467,GUDRUN,
10468,GUDRUN,"Therein was Gunnar the mighty: on the shields of men he sat,"
10469,GUDRUN,"And the sons of his people hearkened, for his hand through the"
10470,GUDRUN,"harp-strings ran,"
10471,GUDRUN,"And he sang in the hall of his foeman of the Gods and the making of man,"
10472,GUDRUN,"And how season was sundered from season in the days of the fashioning,"
10473,GUDRUN,"And became the Summer and Autumn, and became the Winter and Spring;"
10474,GUDRUN,"He sang of men's hunger and labour, and their love and their breeding"
10475,GUDRUN,of broil.
10476,GUDRUN,"And their hope that is fostered of famine, and their rest that is"
10477,GUDRUN,fashioned of toil:
10478,GUDRUN,"Fame then and the sword he sang of, and the hour of the hardy and wise,"
10479,GUDRUN,"When the last of the living shall perish, and the first of the dead"
10480,GUDRUN,"shall arise,"
10481,GUDRUN,"And the torch shall be lit in the daylight, and God unto man shall pray,"
10482,GUDRUN,And the heart shall cry out for the hand in the fight of the uttermost
10483,GUDRUN,day.
10484,GUDRUN,"So he sang, and beheld not Gudrun, save as long ago he saw"
10485,GUDRUN,"His sister, the little maiden of the face without a flaw:"
10486,GUDRUN,"But wearily Hogni beheld her, and no change in her face there was,"
10487,GUDRUN,"And long thereon gazed Hogni, and set his brows as the brass,"
10488,GUDRUN,"Though the hands of the King were weary, and weak his knees were grown,"
10489,GUDRUN,And he felt as a man unholpen in a waste land wending alone.

10493,THE SONS OF GIUKI,
10494,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Now the noon was long passed over when again the rumour arose,"
10495,THE SONS OF GIUKI,And through the doors cast open flowed in the river of foes:
10496,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"They flooded the hall of the murder, and surged round that rampart of"
10497,THE SONS OF GIUKI,dead;
10498,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"No war-duke ran before them, no lord to the onset led,"
10499,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"But the thralls shot spears at adventure, and shot out shafts from afar,"
10500,THE SONS OF GIUKI,Till the misty hall was blinded with the bitter drift of war:
10501,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Few and faint were the Niblung children, and their wounds were waxen"
10502,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"acold,"
10503,THE SONS OF GIUKI,And they saw the Hell-gates open as they stood in their grimly hold:
10504,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Yet thrice stormed out King Hogni, thrice stormed out Gunnar the King,"
10505,THE SONS OF GIUKI,Thrice fell they aback yet living to the heart of the fated ring;
10506,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And they looked and their band was little, and no man but was wounded"
10507,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"sore,"
10508,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And the hall seemed growing greater, such hosts of foes it bore,"
10509,THE SONS OF GIUKI,So tossed the iron harvest from wall to gilded wall;
10510,THE SONS OF GIUKI,And they looked and the white-clad Gudrun sat silent over all.
10511,THE SONS OF GIUKI,
10512,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Then the churls and thralls of the Eastland howled out as wolves accurst,"
10513,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"But oft gaped the Niblungs voiceless, for they choked with anger and"
10514,THE SONS OF GIUKI,thirst;
10515,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And the hall grew hot as a furnace, and men drank their flowing blood,"
10516,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Men laughed and gnawed on their shield-rims, men knew not where they"
10517,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"stood,"
10518,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And saw not what was before them; as in the dark men smote,"
10519,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Men died heart-broken, unsmitten; men wept with the cry in the throat,"
10520,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Men lived on full of war-shafts, men cast their shields aside"
10521,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And caught the spears to their bosoms; men rushed with none beside,"
10522,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And fell unarmed on the foemen, and tore and slew in death:"
10523,THE SONS OF GIUKI,And still down rained the arrows as the rain across the heath;
10524,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Still proud o'er all the turmoil stood the Kings of Giuki born,"
10525,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Nor knit were the brows of Gunnar, nor his song-speech overworn;"
10526,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"But Hogni's mouth kept silence, and oft his heart went forth"
10527,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"To the long, long day of the darkness, and the end of worldly worth."
10528,THE SONS OF GIUKI,
10529,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Loud rose the roar of the East-folk, and the end was coming at last:"
10530,THE SONS OF GIUKI,Now the foremost locked their shield-rims and the hindmost over them
10531,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"cast,"
10532,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And nigher they drew and nigher, and their fear was fading away,"
10533,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"For every man of the Niblungs on the shaft-strewn pavement lay,"
10534,THE SONS OF GIUKI,Save Gunnar the King and Hogni: still the glorious King up-bore
10535,THE SONS OF GIUKI,The cloudy shield of the Niblungs set full of shafts of war;
10536,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"But Hogni's hands had fainted, and his shield had sunk adown,"
10537,THE SONS OF GIUKI,So thick with the Eastland spearwood was that rampart of renown;
10538,THE SONS OF GIUKI,And hacked and dull were the edges that had rent the wall of foes:
10539,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Yet he stood upright by Gunnar before that shielded close,"
10540,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Nor looked on the foeman's faces as their wild eyes drew anear,"
10541,THE SONS OF GIUKI,And their faltering shield-rims clattered with the remnant of their fear;
10542,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"But he gazed on the Niblung woman, and the daughter of his folk,"
10543,THE SONS OF GIUKI,Who sat o'er all unchanging ere the war-cloud over them broke.
10544,THE SONS OF GIUKI,
10545,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Now nothing might men hearken in the house of Atli's weal,"
10546,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Save the feet slow tramping onward, and the rattling of the steel,"
10547,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And the song of the glorious Gunnar, that rang as clearly now"
10548,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"As the speckled storm-cock singeth from the scant-leaved hawthorn-bough,"
10549,THE SONS OF GIUKI,When the sun is dusking over and the March snow pelts the land.
10550,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"There stood the mighty Gunnar with sword and shield in hand,"
10551,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"There stood the shieldless Hogni with set unangry eyes,"
10552,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And watched the wall of war-shields o'er the dead men's rampart rise,"
10553,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And the white blades flickering nigher, and the quavering points of war."
10554,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"Then the heavy air of the feast-hall was rent with a fearful roar,"
10555,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And the turmoil came and the tangle, as the wall together ran:"
10556,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"But aloft yet towered the Niblungs, and man toppled over man,"
10557,THE SONS OF GIUKI,And leapt and struggled to tear them; as whiles amidst the sea
10558,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"The doomed ship strives its utmost with mid-ocean's mastery,"
10559,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And the tall masts whip the cordage, while the welter whirls and leaps,"
10560,THE SONS OF GIUKI,"And they rise and reel and waver, and sink amid the deeps:"

10692,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Reading it all in my easy-chair.
10693,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10694,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Passionate prayer for a minute's life;
10695,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Tortured crying for death as rest;
10696,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Husband pleading for child or wife,"
10697,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Pitiless stroke upon tender breast.
10698,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Was it all real as that I lay there

10700,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10701,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Could I believe in those hard old times,"
10702,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Here in this safe luxurious age?
10703,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Were the horrors invented to season rhymes,"

10705,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"What could I suffer, and what could I dare?"
10706,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,I who was bred to that easy-chair.
10707,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10708,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"They were my fathers, the men of yore,"
10709,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Little they recked of a cruel death;
10710,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"They would dip their hands in a heretic's gore,"
10711,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,They stood and burnt for a rule of faith.
10712,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"What would I burn for, and whom not spare?"

10714,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,

10722,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Now have I tasted and understood

10725,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,They will kill us coolly--they do but wait;
10726,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"While I, I would sell ten lives, at least,"
10727,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,For one fair stroke at that devilish priest.
10728,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10729,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Just in return for the kick he gave,"

10731,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Even a dog by this may save

10733,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"My soul! if he can let the prophet burn it,"

10737,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Just one phrase, and a man gets off it;"
10738,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Look at that mongrel clerk in his tears
10739,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Whining aloud the name of the prophet;
10740,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Only a formula easy to patter,"
10741,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"And, God Almighty, what _can_ it matter?"
10742,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,

10749,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,

10754,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Death means Heaven, he longs to receive it,"

10756,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10757,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Life is pleasant, and friends may be nigh,"
10758,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Fain would I speak one word and be spared;

10768,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Who stoops not either to bless or ban,"
10769,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Weaving the woof of an endless plan.
10770,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10771,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"He is the Reaper, and binds the sheaf,"

10777,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10778,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Surely He pities who made the brain,"

10781,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Nerve shall quiver nor pulse shall beat;
10782,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Bitter the vision of vanishing joys;
10783,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Surely He pities when man destroys.
10784,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10785,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Here stand I on the ocean's brink,"
10786,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Who hath brought news of the further shore?

10791,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10792,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"They tell fair tales of a far-off land,"
10793,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Of love rekindled, of forms renewed;"
10794,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,There may I only touch one hand
10795,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Here life's ruin will little be rued;
10796,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"But the hand I have pressed and the voice I have heard,"
10797,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"To lose them for ever, and all for a word!"
10798,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10799,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Now do I feel that my heart must break
10800,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,All for one glimpse of a woman's face;
10801,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Swiftly the slumbering memories wake
10802,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Odour and shadow of hour and place;
10803,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,One bright ray through the darkening past
10804,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Leaps from the lamp as it brightens last,"
10805,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10806,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Showing me summer in western land
10807,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Now, as the cool breeze murmureth"
10808,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,In leaf and flower--And here I stand
10809,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,In this plain all bare save the shadow of death;
10810,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Leaving my life in its full noonday,"
10811,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,And no one to know why I flung it away.
10812,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10813,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Why? Am I bidding for glory's roll?
10814,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,I shall be murdered and clean forgot;
10815,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Is it a bargain to save my soul?
10816,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"God, whom I trust in, bargains not;"
10817,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Yet for the honour of English race,"
10818,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,May I not live or endure disgrace.
10819,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10820,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Ay, but the word, if I could have said it,"
10821,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,I by no terrors of hell perplext;
10822,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Hard to be silent and have no credit
10823,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"From man in this world, or reward in the next;"
10824,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,None to bear witness and reckon the cost
10825,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Of the name that is saved by the life that is lost.
10826,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,
10827,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,I must be gone to the crowd untold
10828,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Of men by the cause which they served unknown,"
10829,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Who moulder in myriad graves of old;
10830,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,Never a story and never a stone
10831,THEOLOGY IN EXTREMIS,"Tells of the martyrs who die like me,"

11018,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,That rings sae sweet as the winds that beat
11019,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,Round banks where Tyne is born.
11020,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,
11021,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,The Wansbeck sings with all her springs
11022,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,The bents and braes give ear;
11023,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,But the wood that rings wi' the sang she sings
11024,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,I may not see nor hear;
11025,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,"For far and far thae blithe burns are,"
11026,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,And strange is a' thing near.
11027,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,
11028,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,"The light there lightens, the day there brightens,"
11029,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,The loud wind there lives free:
11030,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,Nae light comes nigh me or wind blaws by me
11031,A JACOBITE IN EXILE,That I wad hear or see.

11331,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Jagai.
11332,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"But if he be passed the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,"
11333,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain are sown with
11334,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Kamal's men.'
11335,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,"
11336,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell and the head of the
11337,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,gallows-tree.
11338,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The Colonel's son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat--"
11339,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat."
11340,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,"
11341,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,"
11342,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,"
11343,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack."
11344,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide."
11345,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"'Ye shoot like a soldier,' Kamal said. 'Show now if ye can ride.'"
11346,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils go,"
11347,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe."
11348,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,"
11349,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars as a lady plays with a
11350,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,glove.
11351,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the"
11352,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"dawn,"
11353,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn."
11354,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The dun he fell at a water-course--in a woful heap fell he,--"
11355,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free."
11356,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,He has knocked the pistol out of his hand--small room was there to
11357,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,strive--
11358,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"''Twas only by favour of mine,' quoth he, 'ye rode so long alive;"
11359,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,"
11360,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.
11361,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,"
11362,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row;
11363,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,"
11364,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly.'
11365,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Lightly answered the Colonel's son:--'Do good to bird and beast,"
11366,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.
11367,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,"
11368,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.
11369,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"They will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the"
11370,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"garnered grain,"
11371,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are
11372,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,slain.
11373,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"But if thou thinkest the price be fair, and thy brethren wait to sup,"
11374,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn,--howl, dog, and call them up!"
11375,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,"
11376,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!'"
11377,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.
11378,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"'No talk shall be of dogs,' said he, 'when wolf and grey wolf meet."
11379,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath.
11380,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?'
11381,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Lightly answered the Colonel's son:--'I hold by the blood of my clan;
11382,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Take up the mare for my father's gift--By God she has carried a man!'
11383,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled her nose in his"
11384,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"breast,"
11385,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"'We be two strong men,' said Kamal then, 'but she loveth the younger"
11386,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,best.
11387,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise studded rein,"
11388,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.'"
11389,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,"
11390,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"'Ye have taken the one from a foe,' said he; 'will ye take the mate from"
11391,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,a friend?'
11392,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"'A gift for a gift,' said Kamal straight; 'a limb for the risk of a limb."
11393,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!'"
11394,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"With that he whistled his only son, who dropped from a mountain-crest--"
11395,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,He trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in
11396,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,rest.
11397,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"'Now here is thy master,' Kamal said, 'who leads a troop of the Guides,"
11398,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And thou must ride at his left side as shield to shoulder rides.
11399,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,"
11400,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Thy life is his--thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.
11401,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,"
11402,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,"
11403,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power--
11404,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.'
11405,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no"
11406,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"fault,"
11407,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and
11408,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,salt;
11409,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut
11410,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"sod,"
11411,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names"
11412,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,of God.
11413,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,"
11414,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.
11415,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,"And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear--"
11416,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the
11417,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,mountaineer.
11418,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,'Ha' done! ha' done!' said the Colonel's son. 'Put up the steel at your
11419,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,sides!
11420,A BALLAD OF EAST AND WEST,Last night ye had struck at a Border thief--to-night 'tis a man of the

11440,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,And what should they know of England who only England know?--
11441,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"The poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag,"
11442,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English
11443,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,Flag.
11444,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11445,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,Must we borrow a clout from the Boer--to plaster anew with dirt?
11446,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"An Irish liar's bandage, or an English coward's shirt?"
11447,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,We may not speak of England; her Flag's to sell or share.
11448,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"What is the Flag of England? Winds of the World, declare!"
11449,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11450,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,The North Wind blew:--'From Bergen my steel-shod vanguards go;
11451,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe;
11452,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God,"
11453,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,And the liner splits on the ice-fields or the Dogger fills with cod.
11454,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11455,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"I barred my gates with iron, I shuttered my doors with flame,"
11456,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,Because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came;

11458,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"And they died, but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed."
11459,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11460,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"The lean white bear hath seen it in the long, long Arctic night,"
11461,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,The musk-ox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light:
11462,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my bergs to dare,"
11463,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"Ye have but my drifts to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!'"
11464,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11465,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,The South Wind sighed:--'From the Virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en
11466,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main,"
11467,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,Where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed breakers
11468,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,croon
11469,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"Their endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon."
11470,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11471,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer keys,"
11472,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,I waked the palms to laughter--I tossed the scud in the breeze--
11473,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,"
11474,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,But over the scud and the palm trees an English flag was flown.
11475,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11476,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the
11477,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,Horn;
11478,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,I have chased it north to the Lizard--ribboned and rolled and torn;
11479,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"I have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea;"
11480,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"I have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free."
11481,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,

11488,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"And me men call the Home-Wind, for I bring the English home."
11489,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,Look--look well to your shipping! By the breath of my mad typhoon
11490,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,I swept your close-packed Praya and beached your best at Kowloon!
11491,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11492,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before,"
11493,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,I raped your richest roadstead--I plundered Singapore!
11494,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"I set my hand on the Hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose,"
11495,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,And I heaved your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows.
11496,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11497,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"Never the lotos closes, never the wild-fowl wake."
11498,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,But a soul goes out on the East Wind that died for England's sake--
11499,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"Man or woman or suckling, mother or bride or maid--"
11500,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,Because on the bones of the English the English Flag is stayed.
11501,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11502,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"The desert-dust hath dimmed it, the flying wild-ass knows,"

11506,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,
11507,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,The West Wind called:--'In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly

11509,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"They make my might their porter, they make my house their path,"

11517,THE FLAG OF ENGLAND,"But whether in calm or wrack-wreath, whether by dark or day"

11537,I,This descant upon one of the most glorious feats of arms that

11539,I,the magnificent verse assigned to the Chorus--'_Enter RUMOUR
11540,I,"painted full of tongues_'--to _King Henry V._, the noble piece of"
11541,I,"pageantry produced in 1598, and a famous number from the _Poems"
11542,I,"Lyrick and Pastorall_ (_circ._ 1605) of Michael Drayton. 'Look,'"

11550,I,
11551,I,"This, it is true, was in respect of another _Agincourt_, but"

11553,I,"of which--'To the Cambro-Britons and their Harp, His _Ballad"
11554,I,"of Agincourt_,' is the poet's own description--it is to note"
11555,I,that Drayton had no model for it; that it remains wellnigh
11556,I,"unique in English letters for over two hundred years; and that,"
11557,I,"despite such lapses into doggerel as the third stanza, and some"
11558,I,"curious infelicities of diction which need not here be specified,"
11559,I,"it remains, with a certain Sonnet, its author's chief title"
