101,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
102,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
103,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"He set his sail for Norroway,"
104,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Saint Olaf our good king;
105,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,For Hornelummer he shaped his course
106,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,To see what luck would bring.
107,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"(Red as the ruddy gold, the sun sets over Trondhjem.)"
108,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
109,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Up and spake the steersman bold,"
110,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Stood by the lading-gear:
111,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“At Hornelummer is no good haven,"
112,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,So grim a troll dwells there:
113,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
114,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,“Eyes he hath like a burning brand;
115,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,With his mouth he well can roar;
116,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"His nails stand out, like the horns of a buck,"
117,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,A good ell’s length and more;
118,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
119,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“A beard he hath like a horse’s mane,"
120,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Hangs downward to his knee;
121,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,A long and loathly tail he hath;
122,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,His claws they are ill to see.”
123,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
124,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Up and spake Saint Olaf the king,"
125,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,As the ship swung to and fro:
126,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“Cast off the ropes in the name of God,"
127,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,And let the vessel go!”
128,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
129,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"So soft she sank, so light she rose,"
130,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,O’er the billows she went a-striding;
131,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"And fast she made for Hornelummer,"
132,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Where the ugly troll was biding.
133,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
134,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Out he stalked from his hold i’ the hill,"
135,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"By the rocky rifts a-going,"
136,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,And there he saw Saint Olaf the king
137,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,In his vessel swiftly rowing.
138,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
139,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“Now who comes here, so overbold,"
140,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,My magic to defy it?
141,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Harken, thou with the ruddy beard!"
142,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Full sore thou shalt abye it!
143,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
144,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,“Now nor never by this my coast
145,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Dares any ship to linger!
146,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,I could drag thee into the rifts o’ the rocks
147,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,With the touch of my smallest finger!”
148,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
149,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“Hear now, Ara, thou ancient imp,"
150,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Nor anger thyself at all!
151,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Seize thou the ship as it liketh thee,"
152,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,And see what will befall.”
153,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
154,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"He took the ship by stem and stern,"
155,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"To work her dule and dree,"
156,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"When lo! he sank down into the stone,"
157,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,That held him by the knee.
158,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
159,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“Here stand I, sunken in the stone,"
160,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,To go no more a-roving!
161,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,At wrestling or at hand-play hard
162,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Thy strength I’d fain be proving.”
163,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
164,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“Now tarry thou there, thou wilful wight,"
165,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,All under my powerful charm--
166,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Tarry thou there till Doomsday dread,"
167,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,And work no Christian harm.”
168,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
169,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Out came running his evil mate,"
170,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,And stretched her neck so grim;
171,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Saint Olaf spake one little word,"
172,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Bade her stand still by him.
173,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
174,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Up and spake the little trolls
175,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Who sat i’ the hill down under--
176,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"They asked where the mother-troll might be,"
177,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,With mickle woe and wonder.
178,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
179,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,“Perchance this is the Red-beard’s work
180,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Who hath harried our race so long!
181,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"But come we forth with our brands of iron,"
182,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,To work him wrong for wrong.”
183,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
184,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Up and spake our goodly king--
185,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,He held it a game so merry:
186,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"“Stone to stone, and rock to rock,"
187,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Together ye all shall tarry!”
188,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
189,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Out they sailed from Hornelummer,"
190,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,Well-pleased with the fair adventure;
191,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"The hill he blocked with a mighty stone,"
192,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,That none therein might enter.
193,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
194,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Thanks, thanks to Olaf our gallant king!"
195,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,He wrought a goodly charm!
196,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Now men may sail by Hornelummer,"
197,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,And take no hurt nor harm.
198,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,
199,KING OLAF AND THE TROLLS,"Red as the ruddy gold, the sun sets over Trondhjem."

206,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
207,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"It was young Sir Karel,"
208,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,His mother’s rede did pray
209,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"If he should to the convent ride,"
210,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,And bear his love away.
211,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,(The roses and the lilies all a-blowing.)
212,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
213,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"“Lo, on a bier thou’lt lay thee down,"
214,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,A corse so white and wan--
215,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,And never a one shall ask of thee
216,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,If thou art a living man.”
217,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
218,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"Late, so late at even,"
219,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Sore sickness on him fell;
220,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,All in the early morning
221,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,They tolled for him the bell.
222,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
223,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"They took him, young Sir Karel,"
224,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,And streeked him for a corpse;
225,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"And all to bear the tidings round,"
226,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,His page has taken horse.
227,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
228,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Upon his bier they bore him
229,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,To the convent door so wide--
230,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,The Prioress came to meet them
231,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,With mickle pomp and pride.
232,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
233,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"Forth then went his little page,"
234,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Was clad in the scarlet red--
235,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,He bade the maidens come to watch--
236,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,“For young Sir Karl is dead.”
237,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
238,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,It was little Kirsten
239,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Who asked her mother dear:
240,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"“Mother, may I to the watching wend"
241,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Over the young knight’s bier?”
242,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
243,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"“Put thou on thy scarlet cloak,"
244,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,And deck thy head with gold;
245,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"But be thou ware of young Sir Karl,"
246,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,His wiles are manifold!”
247,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
248,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,She went in where the black bier stood
249,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Betwixt the tapers tall;
250,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,She could not see their burning flames
251,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,So fast her tears did fall.
252,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
253,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"Right soothly for his soul she prayed,"
254,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,All sitting at his head;
255,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,“Alas! thou wast my liefest love
256,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,In the days ere thou wast dead!”
257,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
258,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"She laid her face against his feet,"
259,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,All on the linen white--
260,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"“Oh, in the days ere thou wast dead"
261,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Thou wast my heart’s delight!”
262,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
263,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Right softly then to her he spake:
264,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"“Nay, cease thy bitter crying!"
265,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,For lo! ’tis all for love of thee
266,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,That on this bier I’m lying.
267,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
268,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,“My steed stands in the cloister-garth
269,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"A-tarrying all for thee,"
270,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,"If thou now, little Kirsten,"
271,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Wilt fare afar with me.”
272,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,
273,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,It was young Sir Karel
274,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,Rose up in his shroud so white--
275,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,And as they went from the convent-door
276,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,She bade them a gay good-night.
277,SIR KARL’S LYKEWAKE,

1093,THE KING’S HUNTING,“Thou hast taken a wife of alien life
1094,THE KING’S HUNTING,From far beyond the sea;
1095,THE KING’S HUNTING,And she’s brought in a foreign faith
1096,THE KING’S HUNTING,To flout thy gods and thee.
1097,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1098,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“The kirk-bell rings, the pale priest sings,"
1099,THE KING’S HUNTING,By thorpe and tower and town--
1100,THE KING’S HUNTING,The black rood stands with arms spread wide
1101,THE KING’S HUNTING,Where of old the blood ran down.
1102,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1103,THE KING’S HUNTING,“The carven stone stands drear and lone--
1104,THE KING’S HUNTING,And the old gods in their pain
1105,THE KING’S HUNTING,Rave high and wail in the winter gale
1106,THE KING’S HUNTING,And sob in the running rain.
1107,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1108,THE KING’S HUNTING,“Harken and hear--for I crouched this eve
1109,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Where thistle and dock grow tall,"
1110,THE KING’S HUNTING,And I saw her steal from the postern-gate
1111,THE KING’S HUNTING,And creep by the palace-wall.
1112,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1113,THE KING’S HUNTING,“She’s off and away to the lonely kirk
1114,THE KING’S HUNTING,To keep a cursèd tryst;
1115,THE KING’S HUNTING,"She’s taken thy son, to be bound for aye"
1116,THE KING’S HUNTING,A slave to the wan White Christ.”
1117,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1118,THE KING’S HUNTING,"The king he rides by holt and heath,"
1119,THE KING’S HUNTING,"The witch goes on before,"
1120,THE KING’S HUNTING,By the carven stone on the moorland lone
1121,THE KING’S HUNTING,Where the blood ran down of yore.
1122,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1123,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Oh, wan was the glint of the misty moon"
1124,THE KING’S HUNTING,"In the brimming burn, and shrill"
1125,THE KING’S HUNTING,The wind it wailed in the lean thorn-trees
1126,THE KING’S HUNTING,That crouch upon the hill.
1127,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1128,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“The font is dight, the taper bright,"
1129,THE KING’S HUNTING,I hear the sound of prayer--
1130,THE KING’S HUNTING,Lest I be banned with bell and book
1131,THE KING’S HUNTING,I dare not enter there.”
1132,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1133,THE KING’S HUNTING,All lily-white the fair queen stood--
1134,THE KING’S HUNTING,In strode the angry king--
1135,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“Thy God is thine, but my son is mine,"
1136,THE KING’S HUNTING,And I will not have this thing!”
1137,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1138,THE KING’S HUNTING,"White as a lily-flower, the queen"
1139,THE KING’S HUNTING,Fell down upon her knee--
1140,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“Have pity, have pity, thou cruel king,"
1141,THE KING’S HUNTING,On the souls of mine and me!”
1142,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1143,THE KING’S HUNTING,"The pale priest stood before the rood,"
1144,THE KING’S HUNTING,His look was proud and grim--
1145,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“Stand back, unshriven! the King of Heaven"
1146,THE KING’S HUNTING,Doth claim the babe for Him!”
1147,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1148,THE KING’S HUNTING,Most like the wail of a winter gale
1149,THE KING’S HUNTING,The grisly witch laughed loud--
1150,THE KING’S HUNTING,“The christening-robes are white enow
1151,THE KING’S HUNTING,To serve as a goodly shroud!”
1152,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1153,THE KING’S HUNTING,"She’s witched his arm, she’s witched his heart,"
1154,THE KING’S HUNTING,"She’s witched his blade so true,"
1155,THE KING’S HUNTING,"She’s cast the glamour o’er his eyes,"
1156,THE KING’S HUNTING,The deadly deed to do.
1157,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1158,THE KING’S HUNTING,"The king, he drew his trusty brand,"
1159,THE KING’S HUNTING,And clove him to the chin--
1160,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“Short shrift at least is thine, proud priest,"
1161,THE KING’S HUNTING,Thy God His grace to win!”
1162,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1163,THE KING’S HUNTING,Alas! alas! for the bloody chrism
1164,THE KING’S HUNTING,The king’s son got that day!
1165,THE KING’S HUNTING,For the queen fell down at the self-same stroke
1166,THE KING’S HUNTING,Nor turned not where she lay.
1167,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1168,THE KING’S HUNTING,"He’s seized his young son in his arms,"
1169,THE KING’S HUNTING,And busked his steed to flee;
1170,THE KING’S HUNTING,Like a crooked shadow the grisly witch
1171,THE KING’S HUNTING,Runs ever beside his knee.
1172,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1173,THE KING’S HUNTING,With laughter shrill she’s by him still
1174,THE KING’S HUNTING,While the misty moon grows dim--
1175,THE KING’S HUNTING,Ere he can cross the running burn
1176,THE KING’S HUNTING,She’s reft the babe from him.
1177,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1178,THE KING’S HUNTING,Where the priests of eld high worship held
1179,THE KING’S HUNTING,The witch-wife laughs alone;
1180,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“The babe she bore shall learn my lore,"
1181,THE KING’S HUNTING,And dance by the carven stone!”
1182,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1183,THE KING’S HUNTING,The tapers’ light is quenched in night--
1184,THE KING’S HUNTING,Hushed is the holy bell--
1185,THE KING’S HUNTING,The pale priest’s blood is on the rood--
1186,THE KING’S HUNTING,The old gods have their will.
1187,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1188,THE KING’S HUNTING,*       *       *       *       *
1189,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1190,THE KING’S HUNTING,Now on a day when years are gone
1191,THE KING’S HUNTING,The knights they rise apace--
1192,THE KING’S HUNTING,For the sound of the horn in the dim red morn
1193,THE KING’S HUNTING,Has called them to the chase.
1194,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1195,THE KING’S HUNTING,"The gaunt grey wolf-hounds growl and grin,"
1196,THE KING’S HUNTING,And the king is at their head--
1197,THE KING’S HUNTING,His face is white in the breaking light
1198,THE KING’S HUNTING,As the face of one new-dead;
1199,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1200,THE KING’S HUNTING,His voice is hollow as one that cries
1201,THE KING’S HUNTING,In a dreary vault of stone;
1202,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And, on thin lips, his smile is grim,"
1203,THE KING’S HUNTING,For the trampled branches sound to him
1204,THE KING’S HUNTING,Like the cracking of bare-bleached bone.
1205,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1206,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Ho, holla-ho! the game’s afoot!"
1207,THE KING’S HUNTING,He breaks for the open moor!
1208,THE KING’S HUNTING,"But hearts grow chill, as the pack cries shrill,"
1209,THE KING’S HUNTING,That ne’er felt fear before.
1210,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1211,THE KING’S HUNTING,"The horses sweat, they plunge and fret,"
1212,THE KING’S HUNTING,Tho’ the spur with blood drop fast--
1213,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Each man looks on his fellow’s face,"
1214,THE KING’S HUNTING,And sees it all aghast--
1215,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1216,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Aghast and pale, he knows not why--"
1217,THE KING’S HUNTING,But the king’s is red with wrath--
1218,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“How now, my masters! Shake like babes"
1219,THE KING’S HUNTING,To follow the grey wolfs path?”
1220,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1221,THE KING’S HUNTING,And none spake word but the eldest lord:
1222,THE KING’S HUNTING,“God shield us from the chase!
1223,THE KING’S HUNTING,"For the quarry crossed me as he ran,"
1224,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And the eyes I saw were the eyes of a man,"
1225,THE KING’S HUNTING,Tho’ they looked from a grey wolfs face.”
1226,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1227,THE KING’S HUNTING,Loud laughed the king; “A fitting tale
1228,THE KING’S HUNTING,For doting age to tell!
1229,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Who lists turn back, but I follow the track"
1230,THE KING’S HUNTING,Tho’ it lead to the fires of hell.”
1231,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1232,THE KING’S HUNTING,The king doth force his restless horse
1233,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Till like the deer he bounds,"
1234,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Like a flying breath, o’er the windy heath"
1235,THE KING’S HUNTING,Behind the calling hounds.
1236,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1237,THE KING’S HUNTING,The knightly train spur on amain
1238,THE KING’S HUNTING,As fast as they may flee--
1239,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And two are down by the broken bank,"
1240,THE KING’S HUNTING,And one by the fallen tree.
1241,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1242,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Their shadows run in the wan low sun,"
1243,THE KING’S HUNTING,Like ghosts they flit beside--
1244,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And one is down where the snow lies late,"
1245,THE KING’S HUNTING,And two where the marsh is wide.
1246,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1247,THE KING’S HUNTING,"“Stay, stay, oh king! of all thy train"
1248,THE KING’S HUNTING,Alone I am left to follow!”
1249,THE KING’S HUNTING,But the wind beat back the labouring breath
1250,THE KING’S HUNTING,That rattled hoarse and hollow.
1251,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1252,THE KING’S HUNTING,In the fearful flight each gallant knight
1253,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Lies cold, a broken corse;"
1254,THE KING’S HUNTING,"By two, by one, the hounds drop dead;"
1255,THE KING’S HUNTING,"But the king checks not, nor turns his head,"
1256,THE KING’S HUNTING,Nor curbs his foaming horse.
1257,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1258,THE KING’S HUNTING,Among the lines of the sombre pines
1259,THE KING’S HUNTING,He rides o’er moss and mire;
1260,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And lo! their boughs as a brooding smoke,"
1261,THE KING’S HUNTING,Their stems as a burning fire!
1262,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1263,THE KING’S HUNTING,And had the red sun scorched his sight
1264,THE KING’S HUNTING,Ere he entered the lonely wood?
1265,THE KING’S HUNTING,For he saw in the air but a shifting glare
1266,THE KING’S HUNTING,Like a floating pool of blood.
1267,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1268,THE KING’S HUNTING,And was it but the sighing bough
1269,THE KING’S HUNTING,That whispered in his ear
1270,THE KING’S HUNTING,"A boding thought, an evil breath?--"
1271,THE KING’S HUNTING,Till he could not tell for fear
1272,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Whether a fiend spake in his soul,"
1273,THE KING’S HUNTING,Or a voice spake in his ear.
1274,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1275,THE KING’S HUNTING,"In the heart of the wood, a darksome den"
1276,THE KING’S HUNTING,Where the lightning-blasted tree
1277,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Gleamed in the gloom like whitened bones,"
1278,THE KING’S HUNTING,"He saw the quarry flee,"
1279,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1280,THE KING’S HUNTING,"With lolling tongue and foaming jaws,"
1281,THE KING’S HUNTING,"With faint and faltering pace,"
1282,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And eyes like the eyes of a soul in pain,"
1283,THE KING’S HUNTING,Tho’ they looked from a grey wolf’s face.
1284,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1285,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Lo! with the crash of a falling tree,"
1286,THE KING’S HUNTING,The gallant steed drops dead!
1287,THE KING’S HUNTING,"But he loosed his foot from the stirrup-iron,"
1288,THE KING’S HUNTING,And fast and far he fled.
1289,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1290,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Thro’ grey twilight, thro’ falling night"
1291,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Rang the tireless steps and fleet,"
1292,THE KING’S HUNTING,And the throb of his heart kept feverish time
1293,THE KING’S HUNTING,To the falling of his feet.
1294,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1295,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Oh, thick and tall by the lone kirk-wall"
1296,THE KING’S HUNTING,Grew thistle and broom and bent;
1297,THE KING’S HUNTING,"The holy bell lay where it fell,"
1298,THE KING’S HUNTING,And the walls were riven and rent.
1299,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1300,THE KING’S HUNTING,Like a fair white shroud on the altar-stone
1301,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Lay the late-lingering snow,"
1302,THE KING’S HUNTING,And in the window towards the east
1303,THE KING’S HUNTING,The waning moon hung low.
1304,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1305,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Now, when the beast had reached the kirk,"
1306,THE KING’S HUNTING,"It moaned like one in pain,"
1307,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And swerved, but the hunter cried behind,"
1308,THE KING’S HUNTING,And drove it on again.
1309,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1310,THE KING’S HUNTING,"But when it came to the altar-stone,"
1311,THE KING’S HUNTING,"It started, and leapt, and fell--"
1312,THE KING’S HUNTING,And the shout of the king as he gripped its throat
1313,THE KING’S HUNTING,Mixed with its dying yell.
1314,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1315,THE KING’S HUNTING,And lo! some evil ban was loosed
1316,THE KING’S HUNTING,By the power of the holy place--
1317,THE KING’S HUNTING,And the glazing eyes with ghastly gleam
1318,THE KING’S HUNTING,Glared from a dead man’s face!
1319,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1320,THE KING’S HUNTING,Black as a pall did darkness fall
1321,THE KING’S HUNTING,As the moon hid in a cloud--
1322,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And still lay the king by that nameless thing,"
1323,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Nor knew that he cried aloud,"
1324,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1325,THE KING’S HUNTING,Till the white face glimmered thro’ the gloom
1326,THE KING’S HUNTING,As the moon stole out again;
1327,THE KING’S HUNTING,When he dashed from his eyes the reeking blood
1328,THE KING’S HUNTING,And stared upon the slain.
1329,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1330,THE KING’S HUNTING,"And who may tell, save those of hell,"
1331,THE KING’S HUNTING,Of the horror cold and grim
1332,THE KING’S HUNTING,"That he felt, who saw in that mirk midnight"
1333,THE KING’S HUNTING,His own face look at him?
1334,THE KING’S HUNTING,
1335,THE KING’S HUNTING,"His own dead face, with the haunting eyes"
1336,THE KING’S HUNTING,Of the wife his youth had won?
1337,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Woe, woe! in the were-wolf’s grisly guise,"
1338,THE KING’S HUNTING,"Oh king, thou hast slain thy son!"
1339,THE KING’S HUNTING,

1376,BALLAD OF SIR HERLUIN,"He hid his brow amid the grass,"

1459,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And bow their knees to pray;
1460,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"But the witless wife, she steeks her door,"
1461,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And keeps no holy-day.
1462,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1463,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Oh, the lasses and lads run up and down,"
1464,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Their gleeful games to tread,"
1465,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And they fleer and flout at the witless wife
1466,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,That goes with a shaking head.
1467,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1468,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"But when she turns on them, lasses and lads,"
1469,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"They take to their heels and flee,"
1470,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,For they fear the curse of the witless wife
1471,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And the look of her blinking e’e.
1472,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1473,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"When the owlet shrill called from the hill,"
1474,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"And night was dark and deep,"
1475,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,One came and knocked at her cottage door
1476,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And roused her from her sleep.
1477,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1478,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Oh, the clink I hear of a gallant’s gear,"
1479,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And the tread of steelèd shoon!
1480,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And he that knocks at my door so late
1481,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Is neither knave nor loon!”
1482,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1483,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Come forth, come forth, thou witless wife,"
1484,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And earn a goodly wage!
1485,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"There’s a rune to read, and a spell to speed,"
1486,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,In the hold of Hermitage!”
1487,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1488,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Now nay, now nay, thou black Bothwèll!"
1489,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,I dare not for deadly sin!
1490,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,There’s a heavy spell on that cursed cell
1491,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,That none may enter in.”
1492,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1493,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Oh, the walls are rent, and the roof is riven,"
1494,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And gone is the sealing stone;
1495,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"And the night is deep, and all men sleep,"
1496,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Save thou and I alone.”
1497,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1498,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,“There’s an echo aloof in the riven roof
1499,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Of grisly grammarye!
1500,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And one that doth sleep where the dust lies deep
1501,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,That brooks not a mortal’s eye!”
1502,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1503,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Black, black, I ween, grew Bothwell’s mien;"
1504,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,“If thou dost not my will

1510,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,The leaping lowe shall send a glow
1511,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,To the ships far out at sea!”
1512,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1513,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,The witch-wife goes with shaking head--
1514,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Black Bothwell goes before--
1515,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,To the secret cell where a heavy spell
1516,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Was laid by a lord of yore.
1517,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1518,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"No light was there in earth or air,"
1519,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"No light in all the land,"
1520,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Save the red torch, like an evil eye,"
1521,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,That glimmered in his hand.
1522,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1523,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"When the owlet shrill called from the hill,"
1524,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"And all men were asleep,"
1525,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Slow did they fare by the broken stair,"
1526,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And down to the dungeon deep.
1527,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1528,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,There was nought to see in the doleful vault
1529,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Save the mould and the mildew green--
1530,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,But the hair stood up on Bothwell’s head
1531,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,As he and the witch went in.
1532,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1533,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Oh, deep and still was the secret cell--"
1534,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,There was never a sound to hear
1535,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Save the echo aloof in the riven roof--
1536,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,But his knees were loosed for fear.
1537,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1538,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Oh, thrice she bent, and thrice she bowed,"
1539,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,As she muttered the secret spell--
1540,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,The grisly lore they learned of yore
1541,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,That loosens the fiends of hell.
1542,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1543,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"She rose on her feet, and she stood upright,"
1544,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And high she reared her head;
1545,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Oh, her face was wan to look upon"
1546,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,As the face of one that’s dead.
1547,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1548,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"And like the dead, in the torchlight red,"
1549,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Her eyes were bleared and dim,"
1550,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"And her lips were still, yet ghostly shrill"
1551,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,The voice came forth from them.
1552,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1553,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Like an echo aloof in the riven roof
1554,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,The eldritch voice made moan--
1555,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,“Alas for my sleep in the dust so deep!
1556,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Alas for the sealing stone!”
1557,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1558,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Now heed, now hark, thou spirit dark,"
1559,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And look thou tell me true.
1560,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Say, is it meet, for a lady sweet,"
1561,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,A philtre fine to brew?”
1562,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1563,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,“No philtre fine she needs o’ mine
1564,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,To turn her heart to thee--
1565,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Thou hast set the spell on her thysel
1566,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,With the glint o’ thy bold black e’e!”
1567,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1568,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Dost see her dight in bridal white,"
1569,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,In satin of shimmering fold?
1570,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Does she go like a queen, amid the sheen"
1571,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Of gems, and the red, red gold?”"
1572,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1573,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“I see her dight in lily-white,"
1574,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,But not for the bridal-day--
1575,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And the red round the neck of that shimmer sark
1576,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Is not of the gold so gay!
1577,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1578,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Oh, pay the fee that’s due to me,"
1579,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"The precious price of sin,"
1580,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"That I may dig a grave, a grave,"
1581,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And lay me down therein!”
1582,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1583,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Now hark, now heed! if thou indeed"
1584,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Dost bend her to my will,"
1585,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,Thou shalt ask what fee thou wilt of me
1586,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And take it to thy fill.”
1587,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1588,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“Oh, a fearful fee I ask of thee,"
1589,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And a bitter from thy bride--
1590,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,For pay she must in her people’s trust
1591,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,In pomp and place and pride.
1592,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1593,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,“The hue so fair of bonnie brown hair--
1594,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,The glint of gladsome e’e--
1595,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"And lightsome step, and pride of youth,"
1596,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,She must pay for the love of thee!
1597,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1598,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"“And as for thee, thou shalt know my fee"
1599,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"And curse me, in that day"
1600,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,When thou stretchest thine arms o’er the wan water
1601,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,To the land that’s far away.”
1602,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1603,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,His laughter rang in the riven roof--
1604,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,“I shall not pale nor pine!
1605,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Each dog, they say, must have its day,"
1606,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And shall I not have mine?”
1607,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1608,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"He’s up and out of the doleful vault,"
1609,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,In the misty dawn so dim
1610,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,That glimmers pale on his coat of mail--
1611,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And the witch steals after him.
1612,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1613,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"Oh, her look is cowed, and her back is bowed,"
1614,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And tottering is her tread--
1615,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,And she’s but a witless wife again
1616,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,That goes with a shaking head.
1617,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,
1618,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,The queen sits wan in Jethart town

1638,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,NOTE.--The vault referred to in this ballad is that beneath

1640,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"practised his sorceries--the custody of which, at his execution,"
1641,BOTHWELL’S SOOTHSAYING,"he committed to Redcap, his familiar demon. By the time (some"
