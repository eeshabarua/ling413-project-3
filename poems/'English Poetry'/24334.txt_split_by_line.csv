4260,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Behold our pair then (quite by chance!)
4261,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"In _Vauxhall's_ garden of romance,--"
4262,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"That paradise of nymphs and grottoes,"
4263,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Of fans, and fiddles, and ridottoes!"
4264,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"What wonder if, the lamps reviewed,"
4265,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"The song encored, the maze pursued,"
4266,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,No further feat could seem more pat
4267,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Than seek the Hermit after that?
4268,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Who then more keen her fate to see
4269,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Than this, the new LEUCONOË,"
4270,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,On fire to learn the lore forbidden
4271,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,In Babylonian numbers hidden?
4272,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Forthwith they took the darkling road
4273,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,To ALBUMAZAR his abode.
4274,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4275,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Arriving, they beheld the sage"
4276,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Intent on hieroglyphic page,"
4277,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,In high _Armenian_ cap arrayed
4278,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,And girt with engines of his trade;
4279,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"(As _Skeletons_, and _Spheres_, and _Cubes_;"
4280,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,As _Amulets_ and _Optic Tubes_;)
4281,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,With dusky depths behind revealing
4282,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Strange shapes that dangled from the ceiling,"
4283,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,While more to palsy the beholder
4284,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,A Black Cat sat upon his shoulder.
4285,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4286,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,The Hermit eyed the Lady o'er
4287,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,As one whose face he'd seen before;
4288,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"And then, with agitated looks,"
4289,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,He fell to fumbling at his books.
4290,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4291,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"CARDENIO felt his spouse was frightened,"
4292,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Her grasp upon his arm had tightened;
4293,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Judge then her horror and her dread
4294,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"When ""Vox Stellarum"" shook his head;"
4295,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Then darkly spake in phrase forlorn
4296,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Of _Taurus_ and of _Capricorn_;
4297,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Of stars averse, and stars ascendant,"
4298,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,And stars entirely independent;
4299,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"In fact, it seemed that all the Heavens"
4300,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Were set at sixes and at sevens,"
4301,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Portending, in her case, some fate"
4302,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Too fearful to prognosticate.
4303,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4304,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Meanwhile the Dame was well-nigh dead.
4305,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"""But is there naught,"" CARDENIO said,"
4306,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"""No sign or token, Sage, to show"
4307,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"From whence, or what, this dismal woe?"""
4308,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4309,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"The Sage, with circle and with plane,"
4310,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Betook him to his charts again.
4311,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"""It vaguely seems to threaten Speech:"
4312,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"No more (he said) the signs can teach."""
4313,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4314,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,But still CARDENIO tried once more:
4315,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"""Is there no potion in your store,"
4316,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,No charm by _Chaldee_ mage concerted
4317,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"By which this doom can be averted?"""
4318,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4319,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"The Sage, with motion doubly mystic,"
4320,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Resumed his juggling cabalistic.
4321,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,The aspects here again were various;
4322,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,But seemed to indicate _Aquarius_.
4323,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Thereat portentously he frowned;
4324,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Then frowned again, then smiled:--'twas found!"
4325,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,But 'twas too simple to be tried.
4326,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"""What is it, then?"" at once they cried."
4327,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4328,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"""Whene'er by chance you feel incited"

4331,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"(At times, we know, the softest will!),"
4332,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"This word oracular, my daughter,"
4333,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Bids you to fill your mouth with water:
4334,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Further, to hold it firm and fast,"
4335,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Until the danger be o'erpast."""
4336,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,
4337,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"The Dame, by this in part relieved"
4338,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"The prospect of escape perceived,"
4339,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,Rebelled a little at the diet.
4340,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"CARDENIO said discreetly, ""Try it,"
4341,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Try it, my Own. You have no choice,"
4342,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"What if you lose your charming voice!"""
4343,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"She tried, it seems. And whether then"
4344,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Some god stepped in, benign to men;"
4345,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Or Modesty, too long outlawed,"
4346,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,"Contrived to aid the pious fraud,"
4347,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,I know not:--but from that same day
4348,A TALE: IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR.,She talked in quite a different way.

4358,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4359,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"What is a _Patron_? JOHNSON knew,"
4360,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And well that lifelike portrait drew.
4361,THE NOBLE PATRON.,_He is a Patron who looks down
4362,THE NOBLE PATRON.,With careless eye on men who drown;
4363,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"But if they chance to reach the land,"

4365,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Ah! happy we whose artless rhyme
4366,THE NOBLE PATRON.,No longer now must creep to climb!
4367,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Ah! happy we of later days,"
4368,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Who 'scape those _Caudine Forks_ of praise!
4369,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Whose votive page may dare commend
4370,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"A Brother, or a private Friend!"

4374,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"DICK DOVECOT (this was long, be sure,"
4375,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Ere he attained his _Wiltshire_ cure,"
4376,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"And settled down, like humbler folks,"
4377,THE NOBLE PATRON.,To cowslip wine and country jokes)
4378,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Once hoped--as who will not?--for fame,"
4379,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And dreamed of honours and a Name.
4380,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4381,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"A fresh-cheek'd lad, he came to Town"
4382,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"In homespun hose and russet brown,"
4383,THE NOBLE PATRON.,But armed at point with every view
4384,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Enforced in RAPIN and BOSSU.
4385,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Besides a stout portfolio ripe
4386,THE NOBLE PATRON.,For LINTOT'S or for TONSON'S type.
4387,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"He went the rounds, saw all the sights,"
4388,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Dropped in at _Wills_ and _Tom's_ o' nights;
4389,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Heard BURNET preach, saw BICKNELL dance,"
4390,THE NOBLE PATRON.,E'en gained from ADDISON a glance;
4391,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Nay, once, to make his bliss complete,"
4392,THE NOBLE PATRON.,He supp'd with STEELE in _Bury Street_.
4393,THE NOBLE PATRON.,('Tis true the feast was half by stealth:
4394,THE NOBLE PATRON.,PRUE was in bed: they drank her health.)
4395,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4396,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"By this his purse was running low,"
4397,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And he must either print or go.
4398,THE NOBLE PATRON.,He went to TONSON. TONSON said--
4399,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Well! TONSON hummed and shook his head;
4400,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Deplor'd the times; abus'd the Town;
4401,THE NOBLE PATRON.,But thought--at length--it might go down;
4402,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"With aid, of course, of _Elzevir_,"
4403,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"And _Prologue_ to a Prince, or Peer."
4404,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Dick winced at this, for adulation"
4405,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Was scarce that candid youth's vocation:
4406,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Nor did he deem his rustic lays
4407,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Required a _Coronet_ for _Bays_.
4408,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4409,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"But there--the choice was that, or none."
4410,THE NOBLE PATRON.,The Lord was found; the thing was done.
4411,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"With HORACE and with TOOKE'S _Pantheon_,"
4412,THE NOBLE PATRON.,He penn'd his tributary pæan;
4413,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Despatched his gift, nor waited long"
4414,THE NOBLE PATRON.,The meed of his ingenuous song.
4415,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4416,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Ere two days pass'd, a hackney chair"
4417,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Brought a pert spark with languid air,"
4418,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"A lace cravat about his throat,--"
4419,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Brocaded gown,--en _papillotes_."
4420,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"(""My Lord himself,"" quoth DICK, ""at least!"""
4421,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"But no, 'twas that ""inferior priest,"""
4422,THE NOBLE PATRON.,His Lordship's man.) He held a card:
4423,THE NOBLE PATRON.,My Lord (it said) would see the Bard.
4424,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4425,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"The day arrived; DICK went, was shown"
4426,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Into an anteroom, alone--"
4427,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"A great gilt room with mirrored door,"
4428,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Festoons of flowers and marble floor,"
4429,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Whose lavish splendours made him look
4430,THE NOBLE PATRON.,More shabby than a sheepskin book.
4431,THE NOBLE PATRON.,(His own book--by the way--he spied
4432,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"On a far table, toss'd aside.)"
4433,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4434,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"DICK waited, as they only wait"
4435,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Who haunt the chambers of the Great.
4436,THE NOBLE PATRON.,He heard the chairmen come and go;
4437,THE NOBLE PATRON.,He heard the Porter yawn below;
4438,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Beyond him, in the Grand Saloon,"
4439,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"He heard the silver stroke of noon,"
4440,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And thought how at this very time
4441,THE NOBLE PATRON.,The old church clock at home would chime.
4442,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Dear heart, how plain he saw it all!"
4443,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"The lich-gate and the crumbling wall,"
4444,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"The stream, the pathway to the wood,"
4445,THE NOBLE PATRON.,The bridge where they so oft had stood.
4446,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Then, in a trice, both church and clock"
4447,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Vanish'd before ... a shuttlecock.
4448,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4449,THE NOBLE PATRON.,A shuttlecock! And following slow
4450,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"The zigzag of its to-and-fro,"
4451,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And so intent upon its flight
4452,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"She neither look'd to left nor right,"
4453,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Came a tall girl with floating hair,"
4454,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Light as a wood-nymph, and as fair."
4455,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4456,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"_O Dea certé!_--thought poor Dick,"
4457,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And thereupon his memories quick
4458,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Ran back to her who flung the ball
4459,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"In HOMER'S page, and next to all"
4460,THE NOBLE PATRON.,The dancing maids that bards have sung;
4461,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Lastly to One at home, as young,"
4462,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"As fresh, as light of foot, and glad,"
4463,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Who, when he went, had seem'd so sad."
4464,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"_O Dea certé!_ (Still, he stirred"
4465,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Nor hand nor foot, nor uttered word.)"
4466,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4467,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Meanwhile the shuttlecock in air
4468,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Went darting gaily here and there;
4469,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Now crossed a mirror's face, and next"
4470,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Shot up amidst the sprawl'd, perplex'd"
4471,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Olympus overhead. At last,"
4472,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Jerk'd sidelong by a random cast,"
4473,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"The striker miss'd it, and it fell"
4474,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Full on the book DICK knew so well.
4475,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4476,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"(If he had thought to speak or bow,"
4477,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Judge if he moved a muscle now!)
4478,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4479,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"The player paused, bent down to look,"
4480,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Lifted a cover of the book;
4481,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Pished at the Prologue, passed it o'er,"
4482,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Went forward for a page or more
4483,THE NOBLE PATRON.,(_Asem and Asa_: DICK could trace
4484,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Almost the passage and the place);
4485,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Then for a moment with bent head
4486,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Rested upon her hand and read.
4487,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4488,THE NOBLE PATRON.,(DICK thought once more how cousin CIS
4489,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Used when she read to lean like this;--
4490,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"""Used when she _read_,""--why, CIS could _say_"
4491,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"All he had written,--any day!)"
4492,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4493,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Sudden was heard a hurrying tread;
4494,THE NOBLE PATRON.,The great doors creaked. The reader fled.
4495,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Forth came a crowd with muffled laughter,"
4496,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"A waft of Bergamot, and after,"
4497,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"His Chaplain smirking at his side,"
4498,THE NOBLE PATRON.,My Lord himself in all his pride--
4499,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"A portly shape in stars and lace,"
4500,THE NOBLE PATRON.,With wine-bag cheeks and vacant face.
4501,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4502,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"DICK bowed and smiled. The Great Man stared,"
4503,THE NOBLE PATRON.,With look half puzzled and half scared;
4504,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Then seemed to recollect, turned round,"
4505,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And mumbled some imperfect sound:
4506,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"A moment more, his coach of state"
4507,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Dipped on its springs beneath his weight;
4508,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"And DICK, who followed at his heels,"
4509,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Heard but the din of rolling wheels.
4510,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4511,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Away, too, all his dreams had rolled;"
4512,THE NOBLE PATRON.,And yet they left him half consoled:
4513,THE NOBLE PATRON.,"Fame, after all, he thought might wait."
4514,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Would CIS? Suppose he were too late!
4515,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Ten months he'd lost in Town--an age!
4516,THE NOBLE PATRON.,
4517,THE NOBLE PATRON.,Next day he took the _Wiltshire_ Stage.

4527,INCOGNITA.,INCOGNITA.
4528,INCOGNITA.,
4529,INCOGNITA.,
4530,INCOGNITA.,Just for a space that I met her--
4531,INCOGNITA.,Just for a day in the train!
4532,INCOGNITA.,"It began when she feared it would wet her,"
4533,INCOGNITA.,That tiniest spurtle of rain:
4534,INCOGNITA.,"So we tucked a great rug in the sashes,"
4535,INCOGNITA.,And carefully padded the pane;
4536,INCOGNITA.,"And I sorrow in sackcloth and ashes,"
4537,INCOGNITA.,Longing to do it again!
4538,INCOGNITA.,
4539,INCOGNITA.,Then it grew when she begged me to reach her
4540,INCOGNITA.,A dressing-case under the seat;
4541,INCOGNITA.,"She was ""really so tiny a creature,"
4542,INCOGNITA.,"That she needed a stool for her feet!"""
4543,INCOGNITA.,Which was promptly arranged to her order
4544,INCOGNITA.,"With a care that was even minute,"
4545,INCOGNITA.,"And a glimpse--of an open-work border,"
4546,INCOGNITA.,And a glance--of the fairyest boot.
4547,INCOGNITA.,
4548,INCOGNITA.,"Then it drooped, and revived at some hovels--"
4549,INCOGNITA.,"""Were they houses for men or for pigs?"""
4550,INCOGNITA.,"Then it shifted to muscular novels,"
4551,INCOGNITA.,With a little digression on prigs:
4552,INCOGNITA.,"She thought ""Wives and Daughters"" ""so jolly;"""
4553,INCOGNITA.,"""Had I read it?"" She knew when I had,"
4554,INCOGNITA.,"Like the rest, I should dote upon ""Molly;"""
4555,INCOGNITA.,"And ""poor Mrs. Gaskell--how sad!"""
4556,INCOGNITA.,
4557,INCOGNITA.,"""Like Browning?"" ""But so-so."" His proof lay"
4558,INCOGNITA.,Too deep for her frivolous mood.
4559,INCOGNITA.,That preferred your mere metrical _soufflé_
4560,INCOGNITA.,To the stronger poetical food;
4561,INCOGNITA.,"Yet at times he was good--""as a tonic:"""
4562,INCOGNITA.,Was Tennyson writing just now?
4563,INCOGNITA.,"And was this new poet Byronic,"
4564,INCOGNITA.,"And clever, and naughty, or how?"
4565,INCOGNITA.,
4566,INCOGNITA.,"Then we trifled with concerts and croquêt,"
4567,INCOGNITA.,Then she daintily dusted her face;
4568,INCOGNITA.,"Then she sprinkled herself with ""Ess Bouquet,"""
4569,INCOGNITA.,Fished out from the foregoing case;
4570,INCOGNITA.,"And we chattered of Gassier and Grisi,"
4571,INCOGNITA.,And voted Aunt Sally a bore;
4572,INCOGNITA.,"Discussed if the tight rope were easy,"
4573,INCOGNITA.,Or Chopin much harder than Spohr.
4574,INCOGNITA.,
4575,INCOGNITA.,"And oh! the odd things that she quoted,"
4576,INCOGNITA.,"With the prettiest possible look,"
4577,INCOGNITA.,And the price of two buns that she noted
4578,INCOGNITA.,In the prettiest possible book;
4579,INCOGNITA.,While her talk like a musical rillet
4580,INCOGNITA.,"Flashed on with the hours that flew,"
4581,INCOGNITA.,"And the carriage, her smile seemed to fill it"
4582,INCOGNITA.,With just enough summer--for Two.
4583,INCOGNITA.,
4584,INCOGNITA.,"Till at last in her corner, peeping"
4585,INCOGNITA.,"From a nest of rugs and of furs,"
4586,INCOGNITA.,With the white shut eyelids sleeping
4587,INCOGNITA.,"On those dangerous looks of hers,"
4588,INCOGNITA.,"She seemed like a snow-drop breaking,"
4589,INCOGNITA.,"Not wholly alive nor dead,"
4590,INCOGNITA.,But with one blind impulse making
4591,INCOGNITA.,To the sounds of the spring overhead;
4592,INCOGNITA.,
4593,INCOGNITA.,And I watched in the lamplight's swerving
4594,INCOGNITA.,"The shade of the down-dropt lid,"
4595,INCOGNITA.,"And the lip-line's delicate curving,"
4596,INCOGNITA.,"Where a slumbering smile lay hid,"
4597,INCOGNITA.,"Till I longed that, rather than sever,"
4598,INCOGNITA.,"The train should shriek into space,"
4599,INCOGNITA.,"And carry us onward--for ever,--"
4600,INCOGNITA.,Me and that beautiful face.
4601,INCOGNITA.,
4602,INCOGNITA.,"But she suddenly woke in a fidget,"
4603,INCOGNITA.,"With fears she was ""nearly at home,"""
4604,INCOGNITA.,"And talk of a certain Aunt Bridget,"
4605,INCOGNITA.,"Whom I mentally wished--well, at Rome;"
4606,INCOGNITA.,"Got out at the very next station,"
4607,INCOGNITA.,"Looking back with a merry _Bon Soir_,"
4608,INCOGNITA.,"Adding, too, to my utter vexation,"
4609,INCOGNITA.,"A surplus, unkind _Au Revoir_."
4610,INCOGNITA.,
4611,INCOGNITA.,"So left me to muse on her graces,"
4612,INCOGNITA.,"To dose and to muse, till I dreamed"
4613,INCOGNITA.,That we sailed through the sunniest places
4614,INCOGNITA.,"In a glorified galley, it seemed;"
4615,INCOGNITA.,"But the cabin was made of a carriage,"
4616,INCOGNITA.,"And the ocean was Eau-de-Cologne,"
4617,INCOGNITA.,"And we split on a rock labelled MARRIAGE,"
