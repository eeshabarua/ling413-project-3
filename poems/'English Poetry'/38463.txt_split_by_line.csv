147,NOTES,
148,NOTES,
149,NOTES,Is human life a pleasant game
150,NOTES,That gives a palm to all?
151,NOTES,"A fight for fortune, or for fame?"
152,NOTES,"A struggle, and a fall?"
153,NOTES,"Who views the Past, and all he prized,"
154,NOTES,With tranquil exultation?
155,NOTES,"And who can say, I've realised"
156,NOTES,My fondest aspiration?
157,NOTES,
158,NOTES,"Alas, not one! for rest assured"
159,NOTES,That all are prone to quarrel
160,NOTES,"With Fate, when worms destroy their gourd,"
161,NOTES,Or mildew spoils their laurel:
162,NOTES,"The prize may come to cheer our lot,"
163,NOTES,But all too late--and granted
164,NOTES,'Tis even better--still 'tis not
165,NOTES,Exactly what we wanted.
166,NOTES,
167,NOTES,My school-boy time! I wish to praise
168,NOTES,"That bud of brief existence,"
169,NOTES,The vision of my youthful days
170,NOTES,Now trembles in the distance.
171,NOTES,"An envious vapour lingers here,"
172,NOTES,And there I find a chasm;
173,NOTES,"But much remains, distinct and clear,"
174,NOTES,To sink enthusiasm.
175,NOTES,
176,NOTES,Such thoughts just now disturb my soul
177,NOTES,With reason good--for lately
178,NOTES,"I took the train to Marley-knoll,"
179,NOTES,And crossed the fields to Mately.
180,NOTES,"I found old Wheeler at his gate,"
181,NOTES,Who used rare sport to show me:
182,NOTES,My Mentor once on snares and bait--
183,NOTES,But Wheeler did not know me.
184,NOTES,
185,NOTES,"""Goodlord!"" at last exclaimed the churl,"
186,NOTES,"""Are you the little chap, sir,"
187,NOTES,"What used to train his hair in curl,"
188,NOTES,"And wore a scarlet cap, sir?"""
189,NOTES,"And then he fell to fill in blanks,"
190,NOTES,And conjure up old faces;
191,NOTES,"And talk of well-remembered pranks,"
192,NOTES,In half forgotten places.
193,NOTES,
194,NOTES,It pleased the man to tell his brief
195,NOTES,"And somewhat mournful story,"
196,NOTES,Old Bliss's school had come to grief--
197,NOTES,"And Bliss had ""gone to glory."""
198,NOTES,"His trees were felled, his house was razed--"
199,NOTES,"And what less keenly pained me,"
200,NOTES,A venerable donkey grazed
201,NOTES,Exactly where he caned me.
202,NOTES,
203,NOTES,"And where have all my playmates sped,"
204,NOTES,Whose ranks were once so serried?
205,NOTES,"Why some are wed, and some are dead,"
206,NOTES,And some are only buried;
207,NOTES,"Frank Petre, erst so full of fun,"
208,NOTES,Is now St. Blaise's prior--
209,NOTES,"And Travers, the attorney's son,"
210,NOTES,Is member for the shire.
211,NOTES,
212,NOTES,"Dame Fortune, that inconstant jade,"
213,NOTES,"Can smile when least expected,"
214,NOTES,"And those who languish in the shade,"
215,NOTES,Need never be dejected.
216,NOTES,"Poor Pat, who once did nothing right,"
217,NOTES,Has proved a famous writer;
218,NOTES,"While Mat ""shirked prayers"" (with all his might!)"
219,NOTES,"And wears, withal, his mitre."
220,NOTES,
221,NOTES,Dull maskers we! Life's festival
222,NOTES,Enchants the blithe new-comer;
223,NOTES,"But seasons change, and where are all"
224,NOTES,These friendships of our summer?
225,NOTES,Wan pilgrims flit athwart our track--
226,NOTES,Cold looks attend the meeting--
227,NOTES,"We only greet them, glancing back,"
228,NOTES,Or pass without a greeting!
229,NOTES,
230,NOTES,"I owe old Bliss some rubs, but pride"
231,NOTES,"Constrains me to postpone 'em,"
232,NOTES,"He taught me something, 'ere he died,"
233,NOTES,About _nil nisi bonum_.
234,NOTES,"I've met with wiser, better men,"
235,NOTES,But I forgive him wholly;
236,NOTES,Perhaps his jokes were sad--but then
237,NOTES,He used to storm so drolly.
238,NOTES,
239,NOTES,"I still can laugh, is still my boast,"
240,NOTES,But mirth has sounded gayer;
241,NOTES,And which provokes my laughter most--
242,NOTES,"The preacher, or the player?"
243,NOTES,"Alack, I cannot laugh at what"
244,NOTES,"Once made us laugh so freely,"
245,NOTES,For Nestroy and Grassot are not--
246,NOTES,And where is Mr. Keeley?
247,NOTES,
248,NOTES,"O, shall I run away from hence,"
249,NOTES,And dress and shave like Crusoe?
250,NOTES,"Or join St. Blaise? No, Common Sense,"
251,NOTES,Forbid that I should do so.
252,NOTES,I'd sooner dress your Little Miss
253,NOTES,As Paulet shaves his poodles!
254,NOTES,As soon propose for Betsy Bliss--
255,NOTES,Or get proposed for Boodle's.
256,NOTES,
257,NOTES,"We prate of Life's illusive dyes,"
258,NOTES,Yet still fond Hope enchants us;
259,NOTES,"We all believe we near the prize,"
260,NOTES,Till some fresh dupe supplants us!
261,NOTES,"A bright reward, forsooth! And though"
262,NOTES,"No mortal has attained it,"
263,NOTES,"I still can hope, for well I know"
264,NOTES,That Love has so ordained it.

287,BRAMBLE-RISE.,"The thatch is slate, the plaster bricks,"

301,BRAMBLE-RISE.,That voice I have not heard for long!
302,BRAMBLE-RISE.,So Patty still can sing the song

306,BRAMBLE-RISE.,"But Patty,--Patty's daughter;"
307,BRAMBLE-RISE.,
308,BRAMBLE-RISE.,And has she too outlived the spells
309,BRAMBLE-RISE.,Of breezy hills and silent dells
310,BRAMBLE-RISE.,Where childhood loved to ramble?
311,BRAMBLE-RISE.,"Then Life was thornless to our ken,"
312,BRAMBLE-RISE.,"And, Bramble-Rise, thy hills were then"

314,BRAMBLE-RISE.,
315,BRAMBLE-RISE.,Whence comes the change? 'Twere easy told

321,BRAMBLE-RISE.,
322,BRAMBLE-RISE.,"And senseless too, for mistress Fate"

332,BRAMBLE-RISE.,Are dolls but bran? Can men be base?
333,BRAMBLE-RISE.,When gazing on thy blessed face
334,BRAMBLE-RISE.,I'm quite prepared to doubt it.

3690,BEGGARS.,"He has got a bad face, and a shocking bad hat,"

3695,BEGGARS.,"He eyes my gold chain, as if anxious to crib it;"

3709,BEGGARS.,
3710,BEGGARS.,Am I right? How I wish that our clerical guides

3715,BEGGARS.,A few minutes later--how pleasant for me!--
3716,BEGGARS.,I am seated by Sophy at five-o'clock tea:
3717,BEGGARS.,"Her table is loaded, for when a girl marries,"

3719,BEGGARS.,
3720,BEGGARS.,"""There's a present for you!"" Yes, my sweet Sophy's thrift"

3724,BEGGARS.,
3725,BEGGARS.,"""What a charming _cadeau_! and,"" says I, ""so well made;"
