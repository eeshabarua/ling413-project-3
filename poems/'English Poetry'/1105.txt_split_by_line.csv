5,THE SONNETS,
6,THE SONNETS,by William Shakespeare
7,THE SONNETS,
8,THE SONNETS,
9,THE SONNETS,
10,THE SONNETS,
11,THE SONNETS,1
12,THE SONNETS,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,"
13,THE SONNETS,"That thereby beauty's rose might never die,"
14,THE SONNETS,"But as the riper should by time decease,"
15,THE SONNETS,His tender heir might bear his memory:
16,THE SONNETS,"But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,"
17,THE SONNETS,"Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,"
18,THE SONNETS,"Making a famine where abundance lies,"
19,THE SONNETS,"Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:"
20,THE SONNETS,"Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,"
21,THE SONNETS,"And only herald to the gaudy spring,"
22,THE SONNETS,"Within thine own bud buriest thy content,"
23,THE SONNETS,And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
24,THE SONNETS,"Pity the world, or else this glutton be,"
25,THE SONNETS,"To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee."
26,THE SONNETS,
27,THE SONNETS,
28,THE SONNETS,2
29,THE SONNETS,"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,"
30,THE SONNETS,"And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,"
31,THE SONNETS,"Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,"
32,THE SONNETS,Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
33,THE SONNETS,"Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,"
34,THE SONNETS,Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
35,THE SONNETS,"To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,"
36,THE SONNETS,"Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise."
37,THE SONNETS,"How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,"
38,THE SONNETS,If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
39,THE SONNETS,"Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'"
40,THE SONNETS,Proving his beauty by succession thine.
41,THE SONNETS,"This were to be new made when thou art old,"
42,THE SONNETS,And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
43,THE SONNETS,
44,THE SONNETS,
45,THE SONNETS,3
46,THE SONNETS,"Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,"
47,THE SONNETS,"Now is the time that face should form another,"
48,THE SONNETS,"Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,"
49,THE SONNETS,"Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother."
50,THE SONNETS,For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
51,THE SONNETS,Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
52,THE SONNETS,"Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,"
53,THE SONNETS,Of his self-love to stop posterity?
54,THE SONNETS,Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
55,THE SONNETS,"Calls back the lovely April of her prime,"
56,THE SONNETS,"So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,"
57,THE SONNETS,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
58,THE SONNETS,"But if thou live remembered not to be,"
59,THE SONNETS,Die single and thine image dies with thee.
60,THE SONNETS,
61,THE SONNETS,
62,THE SONNETS,4
63,THE SONNETS,"Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,"
64,THE SONNETS,Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
65,THE SONNETS,"Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,"
66,THE SONNETS,And being frank she lends to those are free:
67,THE SONNETS,"Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,"
68,THE SONNETS,The bounteous largess given thee to give?
69,THE SONNETS,Profitless usurer why dost thou use
70,THE SONNETS,So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
71,THE SONNETS,"For having traffic with thy self alone,"
72,THE SONNETS,"Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,"
73,THE SONNETS,"Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,"
74,THE SONNETS,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
75,THE SONNETS,"Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,"
76,THE SONNETS,Which used lives th' executor to be.
77,THE SONNETS,
78,THE SONNETS,
79,THE SONNETS,5
80,THE SONNETS,Those hours that with gentle work did frame
81,THE SONNETS,The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
82,THE SONNETS,"Will play the tyrants to the very same,"
83,THE SONNETS,And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
84,THE SONNETS,For never-resting time leads summer on
85,THE SONNETS,"To hideous winter and confounds him there,"
86,THE SONNETS,"Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,"
87,THE SONNETS,Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
88,THE SONNETS,Then were not summer's distillation left
89,THE SONNETS,"A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
90,THE SONNETS,"Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,"
91,THE SONNETS,Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
92,THE SONNETS,"But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,"
93,THE SONNETS,"Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet."
94,THE SONNETS,
95,THE SONNETS,
96,THE SONNETS,6
97,THE SONNETS,"Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,"
98,THE SONNETS,In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
99,THE SONNETS,"Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,"
100,THE SONNETS,With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
101,THE SONNETS,"That use is not forbidden usury,"
102,THE SONNETS,Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
103,THE SONNETS,"That's for thy self to breed another thee,"
104,THE SONNETS,"Or ten times happier be it ten for one,"
105,THE SONNETS,"Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,"
106,THE SONNETS,If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
107,THE SONNETS,"Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,"
108,THE SONNETS,Leaving thee living in posterity?
109,THE SONNETS,"Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,"
110,THE SONNETS,To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
111,THE SONNETS,
112,THE SONNETS,
113,THE SONNETS,7
114,THE SONNETS,Lo in the orient when the gracious light
115,THE SONNETS,"Lifts up his burning head, each under eye"
116,THE SONNETS,"Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,"
117,THE SONNETS,"Serving with looks his sacred majesty,"
118,THE SONNETS,"And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,"
119,THE SONNETS,"Resembling strong youth in his middle age,"
120,THE SONNETS,"Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,"
121,THE SONNETS,Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
122,THE SONNETS,"But when from highmost pitch with weary car,"
123,THE SONNETS,"Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,"
124,THE SONNETS,The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
125,THE SONNETS,From his low tract and look another way:
126,THE SONNETS,"So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:"
127,THE SONNETS,Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
128,THE SONNETS,
129,THE SONNETS,
130,THE SONNETS,8
131,THE SONNETS,"Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?"
132,THE SONNETS,"Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:"
133,THE SONNETS,"Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,"
134,THE SONNETS,Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
135,THE SONNETS,"If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,"
136,THE SONNETS,"By unions married do offend thine ear,"
137,THE SONNETS,"They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds"
138,THE SONNETS,In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:
139,THE SONNETS,"Mark how one string sweet husband to another,"
140,THE SONNETS,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
141,THE SONNETS,"Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,"
142,THE SONNETS,"Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:"
143,THE SONNETS,"Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,"
144,THE SONNETS,"Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'."
145,THE SONNETS,
146,THE SONNETS,
147,THE SONNETS,9
148,THE SONNETS,"Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,"
149,THE SONNETS,That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
150,THE SONNETS,"Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,"
151,THE SONNETS,"The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,"
152,THE SONNETS,"The world will be thy widow and still weep,"
153,THE SONNETS,"That thou no form of thee hast left behind,"
154,THE SONNETS,"When every private widow well may keep,"
155,THE SONNETS,"By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:"
156,THE SONNETS,Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
157,THE SONNETS,"Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;"
158,THE SONNETS,"But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,"
159,THE SONNETS,And kept unused the user so destroys it:
160,THE SONNETS,No love toward others in that bosom sits
161,THE SONNETS,That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
162,THE SONNETS,
163,THE SONNETS,
164,THE SONNETS,10
165,THE SONNETS,For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
166,THE SONNETS,Who for thy self art so unprovident.
167,THE SONNETS,"Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,"
168,THE SONNETS,But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
169,THE SONNETS,"For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,"
170,THE SONNETS,"That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,"
171,THE SONNETS,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
172,THE SONNETS,Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
173,THE SONNETS,"O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,"
174,THE SONNETS,Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
175,THE SONNETS,"Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,"
176,THE SONNETS,"Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,"
177,THE SONNETS,"Make thee another self for love of me,"
178,THE SONNETS,That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
179,THE SONNETS,
180,THE SONNETS,
181,THE SONNETS,11
182,THE SONNETS,"As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,"
183,THE SONNETS,"In one of thine, from that which thou departest,"
184,THE SONNETS,"And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,"
185,THE SONNETS,"Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,"
186,THE SONNETS,"Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,"
187,THE SONNETS,"Without this folly, age, and cold decay,"
188,THE SONNETS,"If all were minded so, the times should cease,"
189,THE SONNETS,And threescore year would make the world away:
190,THE SONNETS,"Let those whom nature hath not made for store,"
191,THE SONNETS,"Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:"
192,THE SONNETS,"Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;"
193,THE SONNETS,Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
194,THE SONNETS,"She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,"
195,THE SONNETS,"Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die."
196,THE SONNETS,
197,THE SONNETS,
198,THE SONNETS,12
199,THE SONNETS,"When I do count the clock that tells the time,"
200,THE SONNETS,"And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,"
201,THE SONNETS,"When I behold the violet past prime,"
202,THE SONNETS,And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:
203,THE SONNETS,"When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,"
204,THE SONNETS,Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
205,THE SONNETS,And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
206,THE SONNETS,Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
207,THE SONNETS,Then of thy beauty do I question make
208,THE SONNETS,"That thou among the wastes of time must go,"
209,THE SONNETS,"Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,"
210,THE SONNETS,"And die as fast as they see others grow,"
211,THE SONNETS,And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
212,THE SONNETS,"Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence."
213,THE SONNETS,
214,THE SONNETS,
215,THE SONNETS,13
216,THE SONNETS,"O that you were your self, but love you are"
217,THE SONNETS,"No longer yours, than you your self here live,"
218,THE SONNETS,"Against this coming end you should prepare,"
219,THE SONNETS,And your sweet semblance to some other give.
220,THE SONNETS,So should that beauty which you hold in lease
221,THE SONNETS,"Find no determination, then you were"
222,THE SONNETS,"Your self again after your self's decease,"
223,THE SONNETS,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
224,THE SONNETS,"Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,"
225,THE SONNETS,"Which husbandry in honour might uphold,"
226,THE SONNETS,Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
227,THE SONNETS,And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
228,THE SONNETS,"O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,"
229,THE SONNETS,"You had a father, let your son say so."
230,THE SONNETS,
231,THE SONNETS,
232,THE SONNETS,14
233,THE SONNETS,"Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,"
234,THE SONNETS,"And yet methinks I have astronomy,"
235,THE SONNETS,"But not to tell of good, or evil luck,"
236,THE SONNETS,"Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,"
237,THE SONNETS,Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
238,THE SONNETS,"Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,"
239,THE SONNETS,Or say with princes if it shall go well
240,THE SONNETS,By oft predict that I in heaven find.
241,THE SONNETS,"But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,"
242,THE SONNETS,And constant stars in them I read such art
243,THE SONNETS,As truth and beauty shall together thrive
244,THE SONNETS,"If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:"
245,THE SONNETS,"Or else of thee this I prognosticate,"
246,THE SONNETS,Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
247,THE SONNETS,
248,THE SONNETS,
249,THE SONNETS,15
250,THE SONNETS,When I consider every thing that grows
251,THE SONNETS,Holds in perfection but a little moment.
252,THE SONNETS,That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
253,THE SONNETS,Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
254,THE SONNETS,"When I perceive that men as plants increase,"
255,THE SONNETS,Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
256,THE SONNETS,"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,"
257,THE SONNETS,And wear their brave state out of memory.
258,THE SONNETS,"Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,"
259,THE SONNETS,"Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
260,THE SONNETS,Where wasteful time debateth with decay
261,THE SONNETS,"To change your day of youth to sullied night,"
262,THE SONNETS,"And all in war with Time for love of you,"
263,THE SONNETS,"As he takes from you, I engraft you new."
264,THE SONNETS,
265,THE SONNETS,
266,THE SONNETS,16
267,THE SONNETS,But wherefore do not you a mightier way
268,THE SONNETS,Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?
269,THE SONNETS,And fortify your self in your decay
270,THE SONNETS,With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
271,THE SONNETS,"Now stand you on the top of happy hours,"
272,THE SONNETS,"And many maiden gardens yet unset,"
273,THE SONNETS,"With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,"
274,THE SONNETS,Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
275,THE SONNETS,So should the lines of life that life repair
276,THE SONNETS,Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen
277,THE SONNETS,Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
278,THE SONNETS,Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
279,THE SONNETS,"To give away your self, keeps your self still,"
280,THE SONNETS,And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
281,THE SONNETS,
282,THE SONNETS,
283,THE SONNETS,17
284,THE SONNETS,Who will believe my verse in time to come
285,THE SONNETS,If it were filled with your most high deserts?
286,THE SONNETS,Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
287,THE SONNETS,"Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:"
288,THE SONNETS,"If I could write the beauty of your eyes,"
289,THE SONNETS,"And in fresh numbers number all your graces,"
290,THE SONNETS,"The age to come would say this poet lies,"
291,THE SONNETS,Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.
292,THE SONNETS,So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
293,THE SONNETS,"Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,"
294,THE SONNETS,"And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,"
295,THE SONNETS,And stretched metre of an antique song.
296,THE SONNETS,"But were some child of yours alive that time,"
297,THE SONNETS,"You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme."
298,THE SONNETS,
299,THE SONNETS,
300,THE SONNETS,18
301,THE SONNETS,Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
302,THE SONNETS,Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
303,THE SONNETS,"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,"
304,THE SONNETS,And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
305,THE SONNETS,"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,"
306,THE SONNETS,"And often is his gold complexion dimmed,"
307,THE SONNETS,"And every fair from fair sometime declines,"
308,THE SONNETS,"By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:"
309,THE SONNETS,"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,"
310,THE SONNETS,"Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,"
311,THE SONNETS,"Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,"
312,THE SONNETS,"When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,"
313,THE SONNETS,"So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,"
314,THE SONNETS,"So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
315,THE SONNETS,
316,THE SONNETS,
317,THE SONNETS,19
318,THE SONNETS,"Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,"
319,THE SONNETS,"And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,"
320,THE SONNETS,"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,"
321,THE SONNETS,"And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,"
322,THE SONNETS,"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,"
323,THE SONNETS,And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
324,THE SONNETS,To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
325,THE SONNETS,"But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,"
326,THE SONNETS,"O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,"
327,THE SONNETS,"Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,"
328,THE SONNETS,"Him in thy course untainted do allow,"
329,THE SONNETS,For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
330,THE SONNETS,"Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,"
331,THE SONNETS,My love shall in my verse ever live young.
332,THE SONNETS,
333,THE SONNETS,
334,THE SONNETS,20
335,THE SONNETS,"A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,"
336,THE SONNETS,"Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,"
337,THE SONNETS,A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
338,THE SONNETS,"With shifting change as is false women's fashion,"
339,THE SONNETS,"An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:"
340,THE SONNETS,"Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,"
341,THE SONNETS,"A man in hue all hues in his controlling,"
342,THE SONNETS,Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
343,THE SONNETS,"And for a woman wert thou first created,"
344,THE SONNETS,"Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,"
345,THE SONNETS,"And by addition me of thee defeated,"
346,THE SONNETS,By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
347,THE SONNETS,"But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,"
348,THE SONNETS,Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
349,THE SONNETS,
350,THE SONNETS,
351,THE SONNETS,21
352,THE SONNETS,"So is it not with me as with that muse,"
353,THE SONNETS,"Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,"
354,THE SONNETS,"Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,"
355,THE SONNETS,"And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,"
356,THE SONNETS,Making a couplement of proud compare
357,THE SONNETS,"With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:"
358,THE SONNETS,"With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,"
359,THE SONNETS,That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
360,THE SONNETS,"O let me true in love but truly write,"
361,THE SONNETS,"And then believe me, my love is as fair,"
362,THE SONNETS,"As any mother's child, though not so bright"
363,THE SONNETS,As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
364,THE SONNETS,"Let them say more that like of hearsay well,"
365,THE SONNETS,I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
366,THE SONNETS,
367,THE SONNETS,
368,THE SONNETS,22
369,THE SONNETS,"My glass shall not persuade me I am old,"
370,THE SONNETS,"So long as youth and thou are of one date,"
371,THE SONNETS,"But when in thee time's furrows I behold,"
372,THE SONNETS,Then look I death my days should expiate.
373,THE SONNETS,"For all that beauty that doth cover thee,"
374,THE SONNETS,"Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,"
375,THE SONNETS,"Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,"
376,THE SONNETS,How can I then be elder than thou art?
377,THE SONNETS,"O therefore love be of thyself so wary,"
378,THE SONNETS,"As I not for my self, but for thee will,"
379,THE SONNETS,Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
380,THE SONNETS,As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
381,THE SONNETS,"Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,"
382,THE SONNETS,Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
383,THE SONNETS,
384,THE SONNETS,
385,THE SONNETS,23
386,THE SONNETS,"As an unperfect actor on the stage,"
387,THE SONNETS,"Who with his fear is put beside his part,"
388,THE SONNETS,"Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,"
389,THE SONNETS,Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
390,THE SONNETS,"So I for fear of trust, forget to say,"
391,THE SONNETS,"The perfect ceremony of love's rite,"
392,THE SONNETS,"And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,"
393,THE SONNETS,O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:
394,THE SONNETS,"O let my looks be then the eloquence,"
395,THE SONNETS,"And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,"
396,THE SONNETS,"Who plead for love, and look for recompense,"
397,THE SONNETS,More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
398,THE SONNETS,"O learn to read what silent love hath writ,"
399,THE SONNETS,To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
400,THE SONNETS,
401,THE SONNETS,
402,THE SONNETS,24
403,THE SONNETS,"Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,"
404,THE SONNETS,"Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,"
405,THE SONNETS,"My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,"
406,THE SONNETS,And perspective it is best painter's art.
407,THE SONNETS,"For through the painter must you see his skill,"
408,THE SONNETS,"To find where your true image pictured lies,"
409,THE SONNETS,"Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,"
410,THE SONNETS,That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
411,THE SONNETS,"Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,"
412,THE SONNETS,"Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me"
413,THE SONNETS,"Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun"
414,THE SONNETS,"Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;"
415,THE SONNETS,"Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,"
416,THE SONNETS,"They draw but what they see, know not the heart."
417,THE SONNETS,
418,THE SONNETS,
419,THE SONNETS,25
420,THE SONNETS,"Let those who are in favour with their stars,"
421,THE SONNETS,"Of public honour and proud titles boast,"
422,THE SONNETS,Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
423,THE SONNETS,Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
424,THE SONNETS,"Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,"
425,THE SONNETS,"But as the marigold at the sun's eye,"
426,THE SONNETS,"And in themselves their pride lies buried,"
427,THE SONNETS,For at a frown they in their glory die.
428,THE SONNETS,"The painful warrior famoused for fight,"
429,THE SONNETS,"After a thousand victories once foiled,"
430,THE SONNETS,"Is from the book of honour razed quite,"
431,THE SONNETS,And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
432,THE SONNETS,Then happy I that love and am beloved
433,THE SONNETS,Where I may not remove nor be removed.
434,THE SONNETS,
435,THE SONNETS,
436,THE SONNETS,26
437,THE SONNETS,"Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage"
438,THE SONNETS,Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
439,THE SONNETS,To thee I send this written embassage
440,THE SONNETS,"To witness duty, not to show my wit."
441,THE SONNETS,"Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine"
442,THE SONNETS,"May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;"
443,THE SONNETS,But that I hope some good conceit of thine
444,THE SONNETS,In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
445,THE SONNETS,"Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,"
446,THE SONNETS,"Points on me graciously with fair aspect,"
447,THE SONNETS,"And puts apparel on my tattered loving,"
448,THE SONNETS,"To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,"
449,THE SONNETS,"Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,"
450,THE SONNETS,"Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me."
451,THE SONNETS,
452,THE SONNETS,
453,THE SONNETS,27
454,THE SONNETS,"Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,"
455,THE SONNETS,"The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,"
456,THE SONNETS,But then begins a journey in my head
457,THE SONNETS,"To work my mind, when body's work's expired."
458,THE SONNETS,For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
459,THE SONNETS,"Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,"
460,THE SONNETS,"And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,"
461,THE SONNETS,Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
462,THE SONNETS,Save that my soul's imaginary sight
463,THE SONNETS,"Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,"
464,THE SONNETS,Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
465,THE SONNETS,"Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new."
466,THE SONNETS,"Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,"
467,THE SONNETS,"For thee, and for my self, no quiet find."
468,THE SONNETS,
469,THE SONNETS,
470,THE SONNETS,28
471,THE SONNETS,How can I then return in happy plight
472,THE SONNETS,That am debarred the benefit of rest?
473,THE SONNETS,"When day's oppression is not eased by night,"
474,THE SONNETS,But day by night and night by day oppressed.
475,THE SONNETS,And each (though enemies to either's reign)
476,THE SONNETS,"Do in consent shake hands to torture me,"
477,THE SONNETS,"The one by toil, the other to complain"
478,THE SONNETS,"How far I toil, still farther off from thee."
479,THE SONNETS,"I tell the day to please him thou art bright,"
480,THE SONNETS,And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
481,THE SONNETS,"So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,"
482,THE SONNETS,When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
483,THE SONNETS,"But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,"
484,THE SONNETS,And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
485,THE SONNETS,
486,THE SONNETS,
487,THE SONNETS,29
488,THE SONNETS,"When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,"
489,THE SONNETS,"I all alone beweep my outcast state,"
490,THE SONNETS,"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,"
491,THE SONNETS,"And look upon my self and curse my fate,"
492,THE SONNETS,"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,"
493,THE SONNETS,"Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,"
494,THE SONNETS,"Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,"
495,THE SONNETS,"With what I most enjoy contented least,"
496,THE SONNETS,"Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,"
497,THE SONNETS,"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,"
498,THE SONNETS,(Like to the lark at break of day arising
499,THE SONNETS,"From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,"
500,THE SONNETS,"For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,"
501,THE SONNETS,That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
502,THE SONNETS,
503,THE SONNETS,
504,THE SONNETS,30
505,THE SONNETS,"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,"
506,THE SONNETS,"I summon up remembrance of things past,"
507,THE SONNETS,"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,"
508,THE SONNETS,And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
509,THE SONNETS,Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
510,THE SONNETS,"For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,"
511,THE SONNETS,"And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,"
512,THE SONNETS,And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
513,THE SONNETS,"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,"
514,THE SONNETS,And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
515,THE SONNETS,"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,"
516,THE SONNETS,Which I new pay as if not paid before.
517,THE SONNETS,But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)
518,THE SONNETS,"All losses are restored, and sorrows end."
519,THE SONNETS,
520,THE SONNETS,
521,THE SONNETS,31
522,THE SONNETS,"Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,"
523,THE SONNETS,"Which I by lacking have supposed dead,"
524,THE SONNETS,"And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,"
525,THE SONNETS,And all those friends which I thought buried.
526,THE SONNETS,How many a holy and obsequious tear
527,THE SONNETS,"Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,"
528,THE SONNETS,"As interest of the dead, which now appear,"
529,THE SONNETS,But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
530,THE SONNETS,"Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,"
531,THE SONNETS,"Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,"
532,THE SONNETS,"Who all their parts of me to thee did give,"
533,THE SONNETS,"That due of many, now is thine alone."
534,THE SONNETS,"Their images I loved, I view in thee,"
535,THE SONNETS,And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.
536,THE SONNETS,
537,THE SONNETS,
538,THE SONNETS,32
539,THE SONNETS,"If thou survive my well-contented day,"
540,THE SONNETS,When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
541,THE SONNETS,And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
542,THE SONNETS,These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:
543,THE SONNETS,"Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,"
544,THE SONNETS,"And though they be outstripped by every pen,"
545,THE SONNETS,"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,"
546,THE SONNETS,Exceeded by the height of happier men.
547,THE SONNETS,"O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,"
548,THE SONNETS,"'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,"
549,THE SONNETS,A dearer birth than this his love had brought
550,THE SONNETS,To march in ranks of better equipage:
551,THE SONNETS,"But since he died and poets better prove,"
552,THE SONNETS,"Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'."
553,THE SONNETS,
554,THE SONNETS,
555,THE SONNETS,33
556,THE SONNETS,"Full many a glorious morning have I seen,"
557,THE SONNETS,"Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,"
558,THE SONNETS,Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
559,THE SONNETS,Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
560,THE SONNETS,"Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,"
561,THE SONNETS,"With ugly rack on his celestial face,"
562,THE SONNETS,And from the forlorn world his visage hide
563,THE SONNETS,Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
564,THE SONNETS,"Even so my sun one early morn did shine,"
565,THE SONNETS,"With all triumphant splendour on my brow,"
566,THE SONNETS,"But out alack, he was but one hour mine,"
567,THE SONNETS,The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
568,THE SONNETS,"Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,"
569,THE SONNETS,"Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth."
570,THE SONNETS,
571,THE SONNETS,
572,THE SONNETS,34
573,THE SONNETS,"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,"
574,THE SONNETS,"And make me travel forth without my cloak,"
575,THE SONNETS,"To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,"
576,THE SONNETS,Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?
577,THE SONNETS,"'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,"
578,THE SONNETS,"To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,"
579,THE SONNETS,"For no man well of such a salve can speak,"
580,THE SONNETS,"That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:"
581,THE SONNETS,"Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,"
582,THE SONNETS,"Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,"
583,THE SONNETS,Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
584,THE SONNETS,To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
585,THE SONNETS,"Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,"
586,THE SONNETS,"And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds."
587,THE SONNETS,
588,THE SONNETS,
589,THE SONNETS,35
590,THE SONNETS,"No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,"
591,THE SONNETS,"Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,"
592,THE SONNETS,"Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,"
593,THE SONNETS,And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
594,THE SONNETS,"All men make faults, and even I in this,"
595,THE SONNETS,"Authorizing thy trespass with compare,"
596,THE SONNETS,"My self corrupting salving thy amiss,"
597,THE SONNETS,Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
598,THE SONNETS,"For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,"
599,THE SONNETS,"Thy adverse party is thy advocate,"
600,THE SONNETS,And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
601,THE SONNETS,"Such civil war is in my love and hate,"
602,THE SONNETS,"That I an accessary needs must be,"
603,THE SONNETS,To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
604,THE SONNETS,
605,THE SONNETS,
606,THE SONNETS,36
607,THE SONNETS,"Let me confess that we two must be twain,"
608,THE SONNETS,Although our undivided loves are one:
609,THE SONNETS,"So shall those blots that do with me remain,"
610,THE SONNETS,"Without thy help, by me be borne alone."
611,THE SONNETS,"In our two loves there is but one respect,"
612,THE SONNETS,"Though in our lives a separable spite,"
613,THE SONNETS,"Which though it alter not love's sole effect,"
614,THE SONNETS,Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
615,THE SONNETS,"I may not evermore acknowledge thee,"
616,THE SONNETS,"Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,"
617,THE SONNETS,"Nor thou with public kindness honour me,"
618,THE SONNETS,Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
619,THE SONNETS,"But do not so, I love thee in such sort,"
620,THE SONNETS,"As thou being mine, mine is thy good report."
621,THE SONNETS,
622,THE SONNETS,
623,THE SONNETS,37
624,THE SONNETS,"As a decrepit father takes delight,"
625,THE SONNETS,"To see his active child do deeds of youth,"
626,THE SONNETS,"So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite"
627,THE SONNETS,Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
628,THE SONNETS,"For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,"
629,THE SONNETS,"Or any of these all, or all, or more"
630,THE SONNETS,"Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,"
631,THE SONNETS,I make my love engrafted to this store:
632,THE SONNETS,"So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,"
633,THE SONNETS,"Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,"
634,THE SONNETS,"That I in thy abundance am sufficed,"
635,THE SONNETS,And by a part of all thy glory live:
636,THE SONNETS,"Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,"
637,THE SONNETS,"This wish I have, then ten times happy me."
638,THE SONNETS,
639,THE SONNETS,
640,THE SONNETS,38
641,THE SONNETS,How can my muse want subject to invent
642,THE SONNETS,"While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,"
643,THE SONNETS,"Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,"
644,THE SONNETS,For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
645,THE SONNETS,"O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,"
646,THE SONNETS,"Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,"
647,THE SONNETS,"For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,"
648,THE SONNETS,When thou thy self dost give invention light?
649,THE SONNETS,"Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth"
650,THE SONNETS,"Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,"
651,THE SONNETS,"And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth"
652,THE SONNETS,Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
653,THE SONNETS,"If my slight muse do please these curious days,"
654,THE SONNETS,"The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise."
655,THE SONNETS,
656,THE SONNETS,
657,THE SONNETS,39
658,THE SONNETS,"O how thy worth with manners may I sing,"
659,THE SONNETS,When thou art all the better part of me?
660,THE SONNETS,What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
661,THE SONNETS,And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
662,THE SONNETS,"Even for this, let us divided live,"
663,THE SONNETS,"And our dear love lose name of single one,"
664,THE SONNETS,That by this separation I may give:
665,THE SONNETS,That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:
666,THE SONNETS,"O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,"
667,THE SONNETS,"Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,"
668,THE SONNETS,"To entertain the time with thoughts of love,"
669,THE SONNETS,Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.
670,THE SONNETS,"And that thou teachest how to make one twain,"
671,THE SONNETS,By praising him here who doth hence remain.
672,THE SONNETS,
673,THE SONNETS,
674,THE SONNETS,40
675,THE SONNETS,"Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,"
676,THE SONNETS,What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
677,THE SONNETS,"No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,"
678,THE SONNETS,"All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:"
679,THE SONNETS,"Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,"
680,THE SONNETS,"I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,"
681,THE SONNETS,"But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest"
682,THE SONNETS,By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
683,THE SONNETS,I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
684,THE SONNETS,Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
685,THE SONNETS,And yet love knows it is a greater grief
686,THE SONNETS,"To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury."
687,THE SONNETS,"Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,"
688,THE SONNETS,Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
689,THE SONNETS,
690,THE SONNETS,
691,THE SONNETS,41
692,THE SONNETS,"Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,"
693,THE SONNETS,"When I am sometime absent from thy heart,"
694,THE SONNETS,"Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,"
695,THE SONNETS,For still temptation follows where thou art.
696,THE SONNETS,"Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,"
697,THE SONNETS,"Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed."
698,THE SONNETS,"And when a woman woos, what woman's son,"
699,THE SONNETS,Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
700,THE SONNETS,"Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,"
701,THE SONNETS,"And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,"
702,THE SONNETS,Who lead thee in their riot even there
703,THE SONNETS,Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
704,THE SONNETS,"Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,"
705,THE SONNETS,Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
706,THE SONNETS,
707,THE SONNETS,
708,THE SONNETS,42
709,THE SONNETS,"That thou hast her it is not all my grief,"
710,THE SONNETS,"And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,"
711,THE SONNETS,"That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,"
712,THE SONNETS,A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
713,THE SONNETS,"Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,"
714,THE SONNETS,"Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,"
715,THE SONNETS,"And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,"
716,THE SONNETS,Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
717,THE SONNETS,"If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,"
718,THE SONNETS,"And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,"
719,THE SONNETS,"Both find each other, and I lose both twain,"
720,THE SONNETS,"And both for my sake lay on me this cross,"
721,THE SONNETS,"But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,"
722,THE SONNETS,"Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone."
723,THE SONNETS,
724,THE SONNETS,
725,THE SONNETS,43
726,THE SONNETS,"When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,"
727,THE SONNETS,"For all the day they view things unrespected,"
728,THE SONNETS,"But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,"
729,THE SONNETS,"And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed."
730,THE SONNETS,Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
731,THE SONNETS,"How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,"
732,THE SONNETS,"To the clear day with thy much clearer light,"
733,THE SONNETS,When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
734,THE SONNETS,"How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,"
735,THE SONNETS,"By looking on thee in the living day,"
736,THE SONNETS,"When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,"
737,THE SONNETS,Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
738,THE SONNETS,"All days are nights to see till I see thee,"
739,THE SONNETS,And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
740,THE SONNETS,
741,THE SONNETS,
742,THE SONNETS,44
743,THE SONNETS,"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,"
744,THE SONNETS,"Injurious distance should not stop my way,"
745,THE SONNETS,"For then despite of space I would be brought,"
746,THE SONNETS,"From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,"
747,THE SONNETS,No matter then although my foot did stand
748,THE SONNETS,"Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,"
749,THE SONNETS,"For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,"
750,THE SONNETS,As soon as think the place where he would be.
751,THE SONNETS,"But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought"
752,THE SONNETS,"To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,"
753,THE SONNETS,"But that so much of earth and water wrought,"
754,THE SONNETS,"I must attend, time's leisure with my moan."
755,THE SONNETS,"Receiving nought by elements so slow,"
756,THE SONNETS,"But heavy tears, badges of either's woe."
757,THE SONNETS,
758,THE SONNETS,
759,THE SONNETS,45
760,THE SONNETS,"The other two, slight air, and purging fire,"
761,THE SONNETS,"Are both with thee, wherever I abide,"
762,THE SONNETS,"The first my thought, the other my desire,"
763,THE SONNETS,These present-absent with swift motion slide.
764,THE SONNETS,For when these quicker elements are gone
765,THE SONNETS,"In tender embassy of love to thee,"
766,THE SONNETS,"My life being made of four, with two alone,"
767,THE SONNETS,"Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy."
768,THE SONNETS,"Until life's composition be recured,"
769,THE SONNETS,"By those swift messengers returned from thee,"
770,THE SONNETS,"Who even but now come back again assured,"
771,THE SONNETS,"Of thy fair health, recounting it to me."
772,THE SONNETS,"This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,"
773,THE SONNETS,I send them back again and straight grow sad.
774,THE SONNETS,
775,THE SONNETS,
776,THE SONNETS,46
777,THE SONNETS,"Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,"
778,THE SONNETS,"How to divide the conquest of thy sight,"
779,THE SONNETS,"Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,"
780,THE SONNETS,"My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,"
781,THE SONNETS,"My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,"
782,THE SONNETS,(A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)
783,THE SONNETS,"But the defendant doth that plea deny,"
784,THE SONNETS,And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
785,THE SONNETS,To side this title is impanelled
786,THE SONNETS,"A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,"
787,THE SONNETS,And by their verdict is determined
788,THE SONNETS,"The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part."
789,THE SONNETS,"As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,"
790,THE SONNETS,"And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart."
791,THE SONNETS,
792,THE SONNETS,
793,THE SONNETS,47
794,THE SONNETS,"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,"
795,THE SONNETS,"And each doth good turns now unto the other,"
796,THE SONNETS,"When that mine eye is famished for a look,"
797,THE SONNETS,Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;
798,THE SONNETS,"With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,"
799,THE SONNETS,And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
800,THE SONNETS,"Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,"
801,THE SONNETS,And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
802,THE SONNETS,"So either by thy picture or my love,"
803,THE SONNETS,"Thy self away, art present still with me,"
804,THE SONNETS,"For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,"
805,THE SONNETS,"And I am still with them, and they with thee."
806,THE SONNETS,"Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight"
807,THE SONNETS,"Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight."
808,THE SONNETS,
809,THE SONNETS,
810,THE SONNETS,48
811,THE SONNETS,"How careful was I when I took my way,"
812,THE SONNETS,"Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,"
813,THE SONNETS,That to my use it might unused stay
814,THE SONNETS,"From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!"
815,THE SONNETS,"But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,"
816,THE SONNETS,"Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,"
817,THE SONNETS,"Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,"
818,THE SONNETS,Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
819,THE SONNETS,"Thee have I not locked up in any chest,"
820,THE SONNETS,"Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,"
821,THE SONNETS,"Within the gentle closure of my breast,"
822,THE SONNETS,"From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,"
823,THE SONNETS,"And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,"
824,THE SONNETS,For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
825,THE SONNETS,
826,THE SONNETS,
827,THE SONNETS,49
828,THE SONNETS,Against that time (if ever that time come)
829,THE SONNETS,"When I shall see thee frown on my defects,"
830,THE SONNETS,"When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,"
831,THE SONNETS,"Called to that audit by advised respects,"
832,THE SONNETS,"Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,"
833,THE SONNETS,"And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,"
834,THE SONNETS,When love converted from the thing it was
835,THE SONNETS,Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
836,THE SONNETS,Against that time do I ensconce me here
837,THE SONNETS,"Within the knowledge of mine own desert,"
838,THE SONNETS,"And this my hand, against my self uprear,"
839,THE SONNETS,"To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,"
840,THE SONNETS,"To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,"
841,THE SONNETS,"Since why to love, I can allege no cause."
842,THE SONNETS,
843,THE SONNETS,
844,THE SONNETS,50
845,THE SONNETS,"How heavy do I journey on the way,"
846,THE SONNETS,When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
847,THE SONNETS,Doth teach that case and that repose to say
848,THE SONNETS,'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
849,THE SONNETS,"The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,"
850,THE SONNETS,"Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,"
851,THE SONNETS,As if by some instinct the wretch did know
852,THE SONNETS,His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
853,THE SONNETS,"The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,"
854,THE SONNETS,"That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,"
855,THE SONNETS,"Which heavily he answers with a groan,"
856,THE SONNETS,"More sharp to me than spurring to his side,"
857,THE SONNETS,"For that same groan doth put this in my mind,"
858,THE SONNETS,My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
859,THE SONNETS,
860,THE SONNETS,
861,THE SONNETS,51
862,THE SONNETS,"Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,"
863,THE SONNETS,"Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,"
864,THE SONNETS,"From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?"
865,THE SONNETS,Till I return of posting is no need.
866,THE SONNETS,"O what excuse will my poor beast then find,"
867,THE SONNETS,When swift extremity can seem but slow?
868,THE SONNETS,"Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,"
869,THE SONNETS,"In winged speed no motion shall I know,"
870,THE SONNETS,"Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,"
871,THE SONNETS,Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)
872,THE SONNETS,"Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,"
873,THE SONNETS,"But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,"
874,THE SONNETS,"Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,"
875,THE SONNETS,"Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go."
876,THE SONNETS,
877,THE SONNETS,
878,THE SONNETS,52
879,THE SONNETS,"So am I as the rich whose blessed key,"
880,THE SONNETS,"Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,"
881,THE SONNETS,"The which he will not every hour survey,"
882,THE SONNETS,For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
883,THE SONNETS,"Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,"
884,THE SONNETS,"Since seldom coming in that long year set,"
885,THE SONNETS,"Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,"
886,THE SONNETS,Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
887,THE SONNETS,So is the time that keeps you as my chest
888,THE SONNETS,"Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,"
889,THE SONNETS,"To make some special instant special-blest,"
890,THE SONNETS,By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
891,THE SONNETS,"Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,"
892,THE SONNETS,"Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope."
893,THE SONNETS,
894,THE SONNETS,
895,THE SONNETS,53
896,THE SONNETS,"What is your substance, whereof are you made,"
897,THE SONNETS,That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
898,THE SONNETS,"Since every one, hath every one, one shade,"
899,THE SONNETS,"And you but one, can every shadow lend:"
900,THE SONNETS,"Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,"
901,THE SONNETS,"Is poorly imitated after you,"
902,THE SONNETS,"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,"
903,THE SONNETS,And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
904,THE SONNETS,"Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,"
905,THE SONNETS,"The one doth shadow of your beauty show,"
906,THE SONNETS,"The other as your bounty doth appear,"
907,THE SONNETS,And you in every blessed shape we know.
908,THE SONNETS,"In all external grace you have some part,"
909,THE SONNETS,"But you like none, none you for constant heart."
910,THE SONNETS,
911,THE SONNETS,
912,THE SONNETS,54
913,THE SONNETS,"O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,"
914,THE SONNETS,By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
915,THE SONNETS,"The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem"
916,THE SONNETS,"For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:"
917,THE SONNETS,"The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,"
918,THE SONNETS,"As the perfumed tincture of the roses,"
919,THE SONNETS,"Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,"
920,THE SONNETS,When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
921,THE SONNETS,"But for their virtue only is their show,"
922,THE SONNETS,"They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,"
923,THE SONNETS,"Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,"
924,THE SONNETS,"Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:"
925,THE SONNETS,"And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,"
926,THE SONNETS,"When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth."
927,THE SONNETS,
928,THE SONNETS,
929,THE SONNETS,55
930,THE SONNETS,"Not marble, nor the gilded monuments"
931,THE SONNETS,"Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,"
932,THE SONNETS,But you shall shine more bright in these contents
933,THE SONNETS,"Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time."
934,THE SONNETS,"When wasteful war shall statues overturn,"
935,THE SONNETS,"And broils root out the work of masonry,"
936,THE SONNETS,"Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:"
937,THE SONNETS,The living record of your memory.
938,THE SONNETS,"'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity"
939,THE SONNETS,"Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,"
940,THE SONNETS,Even in the eyes of all posterity
941,THE SONNETS,That wear this world out to the ending doom.
942,THE SONNETS,"So till the judgment that your self arise,"
943,THE SONNETS,"You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes."
944,THE SONNETS,
945,THE SONNETS,
946,THE SONNETS,56
947,THE SONNETS,"Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said"
948,THE SONNETS,"Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,"
949,THE SONNETS,"Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,"
950,THE SONNETS,To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
951,THE SONNETS,"So love be thou, although to-day thou fill"
952,THE SONNETS,"Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,"
953,THE SONNETS,"To-morrow see again, and do not kill"
954,THE SONNETS,"The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:"
955,THE SONNETS,Let this sad interim like the ocean be
956,THE SONNETS,"Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,"
957,THE SONNETS,"Come daily to the banks, that when they see:"
958,THE SONNETS,"Return of love, more blest may be the view."
959,THE SONNETS,"Or call it winter, which being full of care,"
960,THE SONNETS,"Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare."
961,THE SONNETS,
962,THE SONNETS,
963,THE SONNETS,57
964,THE SONNETS,"Being your slave what should I do but tend,"
965,THE SONNETS,"Upon the hours, and times of your desire?"
966,THE SONNETS,I have no precious time at all to spend;
967,THE SONNETS,Nor services to do till you require.
968,THE SONNETS,"Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,"
969,THE SONNETS,"Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,"
970,THE SONNETS,"Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,"
971,THE SONNETS,When you have bid your servant once adieu.
972,THE SONNETS,"Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,"
973,THE SONNETS,"Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,"
974,THE SONNETS,But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
975,THE SONNETS,"Save where you are, how happy you make those."
976,THE SONNETS,"So true a fool is love, that in your will,"
977,THE SONNETS,(Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.
978,THE SONNETS,
979,THE SONNETS,
980,THE SONNETS,58
981,THE SONNETS,"That god forbid, that made me first your slave,"
982,THE SONNETS,"I should in thought control your times of pleasure,"
983,THE SONNETS,"Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,"
984,THE SONNETS,Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
985,THE SONNETS,O let me suffer (being at your beck)
986,THE SONNETS,"Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,"
987,THE SONNETS,"And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,"
988,THE SONNETS,Without accusing you of injury.
989,THE SONNETS,"Be where you list, your charter is so strong,"
990,THE SONNETS,That you your self may privilage your time
991,THE SONNETS,"To what you will, to you it doth belong,"
992,THE SONNETS,Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.
993,THE SONNETS,"I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,"
994,THE SONNETS,Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
995,THE SONNETS,
996,THE SONNETS,
997,THE SONNETS,59
998,THE SONNETS,"If there be nothing new, but that which is,"
999,THE SONNETS,"Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,"
1000,THE SONNETS,Which labouring for invention bear amis
1001,THE SONNETS,The second burthen of a former child!
1002,THE SONNETS,"O that record could with a backward look,"
1003,THE SONNETS,"Even of five hundred courses of the sun,"
1004,THE SONNETS,"Show me your image in some antique book,"
1005,THE SONNETS,Since mind at first in character was done.
1006,THE SONNETS,"That I might see what the old world could say,"
1007,THE SONNETS,"To this composed wonder of your frame,"
1008,THE SONNETS,"Whether we are mended, or whether better they,"
1009,THE SONNETS,Or whether revolution be the same.
1010,THE SONNETS,"O sure I am the wits of former days,"
1011,THE SONNETS,To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
1012,THE SONNETS,
1013,THE SONNETS,
1014,THE SONNETS,60
1015,THE SONNETS,"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,"
1016,THE SONNETS,"So do our minutes hasten to their end,"
1017,THE SONNETS,"Each changing place with that which goes before,"
1018,THE SONNETS,In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
1019,THE SONNETS,"Nativity once in the main of light,"
1020,THE SONNETS,"Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,"
1021,THE SONNETS,"Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,"
1022,THE SONNETS,"And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound."
1023,THE SONNETS,"Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,"
1024,THE SONNETS,"And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,"
1025,THE SONNETS,"Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,"
1026,THE SONNETS,And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
1027,THE SONNETS,"And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand"
1028,THE SONNETS,"Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand."
1029,THE SONNETS,
1030,THE SONNETS,
1031,THE SONNETS,61
1032,THE SONNETS,"Is it thy will, thy image should keep open"
1033,THE SONNETS,My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
1034,THE SONNETS,"Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,"
1035,THE SONNETS,While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
1036,THE SONNETS,Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
1037,THE SONNETS,"So far from home into my deeds to pry,"
1038,THE SONNETS,"To find out shames and idle hours in me,"
1039,THE SONNETS,The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
1040,THE SONNETS,"O no, thy love though much, is not so great,"
1041,THE SONNETS,"It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,"
1042,THE SONNETS,"Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,"
1043,THE SONNETS,To play the watchman ever for thy sake.
1044,THE SONNETS,"For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,"
1045,THE SONNETS,"From me far off, with others all too near."
1046,THE SONNETS,
1047,THE SONNETS,
1048,THE SONNETS,62
1049,THE SONNETS,"Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,"
1050,THE SONNETS,"And all my soul, and all my every part;"
1051,THE SONNETS,"And for this sin there is no remedy,"
1052,THE SONNETS,It is so grounded inward in my heart.
1053,THE SONNETS,"Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,"
1054,THE SONNETS,"No shape so true, no truth of such account,"
1055,THE SONNETS,"And for my self mine own worth do define,"
1056,THE SONNETS,As I all other in all worths surmount.
1057,THE SONNETS,But when my glass shows me my self indeed
1058,THE SONNETS,"beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,"
1059,THE SONNETS,Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
1060,THE SONNETS,"Self, so self-loving were iniquity."
1061,THE SONNETS,"'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,"
1062,THE SONNETS,Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
1063,THE SONNETS,
1064,THE SONNETS,
1065,THE SONNETS,63
1066,THE SONNETS,Against my love shall be as I am now
1067,THE SONNETS,"With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,"
1068,THE SONNETS,When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
1069,THE SONNETS,"With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn"
1070,THE SONNETS,"Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,"
1071,THE SONNETS,And all those beauties whereof now he's king
1072,THE SONNETS,"Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,"
1073,THE SONNETS,Stealing away the treasure of his spring:
1074,THE SONNETS,For such a time do I now fortify
1075,THE SONNETS,"Against confounding age's cruel knife,"
1076,THE SONNETS,That he shall never cut from memory
1077,THE SONNETS,"My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life."
1078,THE SONNETS,"His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,"
1079,THE SONNETS,"And they shall live, and he in them still green."
1080,THE SONNETS,
1081,THE SONNETS,
1082,THE SONNETS,64
1083,THE SONNETS,When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
1084,THE SONNETS,"The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,"
1085,THE SONNETS,"When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,"
1086,THE SONNETS,And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
1087,THE SONNETS,When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
1088,THE SONNETS,"Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
1089,THE SONNETS,"And the firm soil win of the watery main,"
1090,THE SONNETS,"Increasing store with loss, and loss with store."
1091,THE SONNETS,"When I have seen such interchange of State,"
1092,THE SONNETS,"Or state it self confounded, to decay,"
1093,THE SONNETS,Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
1094,THE SONNETS,That Time will come and take my love away.
1095,THE SONNETS,This thought is as a death which cannot choose
1096,THE SONNETS,"But weep to have, that which it fears to lose."
1097,THE SONNETS,
1098,THE SONNETS,
1099,THE SONNETS,65
1100,THE SONNETS,"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,"
1101,THE SONNETS,"But sad mortality o'ersways their power,"
1102,THE SONNETS,"How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,"
1103,THE SONNETS,Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
1104,THE SONNETS,"O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,"
1105,THE SONNETS,"Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,"
1106,THE SONNETS,"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,"
1107,THE SONNETS,Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
1108,THE SONNETS,"O fearful meditation, where alack,"
1109,THE SONNETS,Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
1110,THE SONNETS,"Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,"
1111,THE SONNETS,Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
1112,THE SONNETS,"O none, unless this miracle have might,"
1113,THE SONNETS,That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
1114,THE SONNETS,
1115,THE SONNETS,
1116,THE SONNETS,66
1117,THE SONNETS,"Tired with all these for restful death I cry,"
1118,THE SONNETS,"As to behold desert a beggar born,"
1119,THE SONNETS,"And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,"
1120,THE SONNETS,"And purest faith unhappily forsworn,"
1121,THE SONNETS,"And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,"
1122,THE SONNETS,"And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,"
1123,THE SONNETS,"And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,"
1124,THE SONNETS,And strength by limping sway disabled
1125,THE SONNETS,"And art made tongue-tied by authority,"
1126,THE SONNETS,"And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,"
1127,THE SONNETS,"And simple truth miscalled simplicity,"
1128,THE SONNETS,And captive good attending captain ill.
1129,THE SONNETS,"Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,"
1130,THE SONNETS,"Save that to die, I leave my love alone."
1131,THE SONNETS,
1132,THE SONNETS,
1133,THE SONNETS,67
1134,THE SONNETS,"Ah wherefore with infection should he live,"
1135,THE SONNETS,"And with his presence grace impiety,"
1136,THE SONNETS,"That sin by him advantage should achieve,"
1137,THE SONNETS,And lace it self with his society?
1138,THE SONNETS,"Why should false painting imitate his cheek,"
1139,THE SONNETS,And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
1140,THE SONNETS,"Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,"
1141,THE SONNETS,"Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?"
1142,THE SONNETS,"Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,"
1143,THE SONNETS,"Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,"
1144,THE SONNETS,"For she hath no exchequer now but his,"
1145,THE SONNETS,"And proud of many, lives upon his gains?"
1146,THE SONNETS,"O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,"
1147,THE SONNETS,"In days long since, before these last so bad."
1148,THE SONNETS,
1149,THE SONNETS,
1150,THE SONNETS,68
1151,THE SONNETS,"Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,"
1152,THE SONNETS,"When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,"
1153,THE SONNETS,"Before these bastard signs of fair were born,"
1154,THE SONNETS,Or durst inhabit on a living brow:
1155,THE SONNETS,"Before the golden tresses of the dead,"
1156,THE SONNETS,"The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,"
1157,THE SONNETS,"To live a second life on second head,"
1158,THE SONNETS,Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
1159,THE SONNETS,"In him those holy antique hours are seen,"
1160,THE SONNETS,"Without all ornament, it self and true,"
1161,THE SONNETS,"Making no summer of another's green,"
1162,THE SONNETS,"Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,"
1163,THE SONNETS,"And him as for a map doth Nature store,"
1164,THE SONNETS,To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
1165,THE SONNETS,
1166,THE SONNETS,
1167,THE SONNETS,69
1168,THE SONNETS,"Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,"
1169,THE SONNETS,Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
1170,THE SONNETS,"All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,"
1171,THE SONNETS,"Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend."
1172,THE SONNETS,"Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,"
1173,THE SONNETS,"But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,"
1174,THE SONNETS,In other accents do this praise confound
1175,THE SONNETS,By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
1176,THE SONNETS,"They look into the beauty of thy mind,"
1177,THE SONNETS,"And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,"
1178,THE SONNETS,Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
1179,THE SONNETS,To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
1180,THE SONNETS,"But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,"
1181,THE SONNETS,"The soil is this, that thou dost common grow."
1182,THE SONNETS,
1183,THE SONNETS,
1184,THE SONNETS,70
1185,THE SONNETS,"That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,"
1186,THE SONNETS,"For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,"
1187,THE SONNETS,"The ornament of beauty is suspect,"
1188,THE SONNETS,A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
1189,THE SONNETS,"So thou be good, slander doth but approve,"
1190,THE SONNETS,"Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,"
1191,THE SONNETS,"For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,"
1192,THE SONNETS,And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
1193,THE SONNETS,"Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,"
1194,THE SONNETS,"Either not assailed, or victor being charged,"
1195,THE SONNETS,"Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,"
1196,THE SONNETS,"To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,"
1197,THE SONNETS,"If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,"
1198,THE SONNETS,Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
1199,THE SONNETS,
1200,THE SONNETS,
1201,THE SONNETS,71
1202,THE SONNETS,"No longer mourn for me when I am dead,"
1203,THE SONNETS,Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
1204,THE SONNETS,Give warning to the world that I am fled
1205,THE SONNETS,From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
1206,THE SONNETS,"Nay if you read this line, remember not,"
1207,THE SONNETS,"The hand that writ it, for I love you so,"
1208,THE SONNETS,"That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,"
1209,THE SONNETS,If thinking on me then should make you woe.
1210,THE SONNETS,"O if (I say) you look upon this verse,"
1211,THE SONNETS,"When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,"
1212,THE SONNETS,Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
1213,THE SONNETS,But let your love even with my life decay.
1214,THE SONNETS,"Lest the wise world should look into your moan,"
1215,THE SONNETS,And mock you with me after I am gone.
1216,THE SONNETS,
1217,THE SONNETS,
1218,THE SONNETS,72
1219,THE SONNETS,"O lest the world should task you to recite,"
1220,THE SONNETS,What merit lived in me that you should love
1221,THE SONNETS,"After my death (dear love) forget me quite,"
1222,THE SONNETS,For you in me can nothing worthy prove.
1223,THE SONNETS,"Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,"
1224,THE SONNETS,"To do more for me than mine own desert,"
1225,THE SONNETS,"And hang more praise upon deceased I,"
1226,THE SONNETS,Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
1227,THE SONNETS,"O lest your true love may seem false in this,"
1228,THE SONNETS,"That you for love speak well of me untrue,"
1229,THE SONNETS,"My name be buried where my body is,"
1230,THE SONNETS,"And live no more to shame nor me, nor you."
1231,THE SONNETS,"For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,"
1232,THE SONNETS,"And so should you, to love things nothing worth."
1233,THE SONNETS,
1234,THE SONNETS,
1235,THE SONNETS,73
1236,THE SONNETS,"That time of year thou mayst in me behold,"
1237,THE SONNETS,"When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang"
1238,THE SONNETS,"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,"
1239,THE SONNETS,"Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang."
1240,THE SONNETS,"In me thou seest the twilight of such day,"
1241,THE SONNETS,"As after sunset fadeth in the west,"
1242,THE SONNETS,"Which by and by black night doth take away,"
1243,THE SONNETS,Death's second self that seals up all in rest.
1244,THE SONNETS,"In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,"
1245,THE SONNETS,"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,"
1246,THE SONNETS,"As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,"
1247,THE SONNETS,Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
1248,THE SONNETS,"This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,"
1249,THE SONNETS,"To love that well, which thou must leave ere long."
1250,THE SONNETS,
1251,THE SONNETS,
1252,THE SONNETS,74
1253,THE SONNETS,"But be contented when that fell arrest,"
1254,THE SONNETS,"Without all bail shall carry me away,"
1255,THE SONNETS,"My life hath in this line some interest,"
1256,THE SONNETS,Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
1257,THE SONNETS,"When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,"
1258,THE SONNETS,"The very part was consecrate to thee,"
1259,THE SONNETS,"The earth can have but earth, which is his due,"
1260,THE SONNETS,"My spirit is thine the better part of me,"
1261,THE SONNETS,"So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,"
1262,THE SONNETS,"The prey of worms, my body being dead,"
1263,THE SONNETS,"The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,"
1264,THE SONNETS,"Too base of thee to be remembered,"
1265,THE SONNETS,"The worth of that, is that which it contains,"
1266,THE SONNETS,"And that is this, and this with thee remains."
1267,THE SONNETS,
1268,THE SONNETS,
1269,THE SONNETS,75
1270,THE SONNETS,"So are you to my thoughts as food to life,"
1271,THE SONNETS,Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
1272,THE SONNETS,And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1273,THE SONNETS,As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
1274,THE SONNETS,"Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon"
1275,THE SONNETS,"Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,"
1276,THE SONNETS,"Now counting best to be with you alone,"
1277,THE SONNETS,"Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,"
1278,THE SONNETS,"Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,"
1279,THE SONNETS,"And by and by clean starved for a look,"
1280,THE SONNETS,Possessing or pursuing no delight
1281,THE SONNETS,"Save what is had, or must from you be took."
1282,THE SONNETS,"Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,"
1283,THE SONNETS,"Or gluttoning on all, or all away."
1284,THE SONNETS,
1285,THE SONNETS,
1286,THE SONNETS,76
1287,THE SONNETS,Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
1288,THE SONNETS,So far from variation or quick change?
1289,THE SONNETS,Why with the time do I not glance aside
1290,THE SONNETS,"To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?"
1291,THE SONNETS,"Why write I still all one, ever the same,"
1292,THE SONNETS,"And keep invention in a noted weed,"
1293,THE SONNETS,"That every word doth almost tell my name,"
1294,THE SONNETS,"Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?"
1295,THE SONNETS,"O know sweet love I always write of you,"
1296,THE SONNETS,And you and love are still my argument:
1297,THE SONNETS,"So all my best is dressing old words new,"
1298,THE SONNETS,Spending again what is already spent:
1299,THE SONNETS,"For as the sun is daily new and old,"
1300,THE SONNETS,So is my love still telling what is told.
1301,THE SONNETS,
1302,THE SONNETS,
1303,THE SONNETS,77
1304,THE SONNETS,"Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,"
1305,THE SONNETS,"Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,"
1306,THE SONNETS,"These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,"
1307,THE SONNETS,"And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste."
1308,THE SONNETS,"The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,"
1309,THE SONNETS,"Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,"
1310,THE SONNETS,"Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,"
1311,THE SONNETS,Time's thievish progress to eternity.
1312,THE SONNETS,"Look what thy memory cannot contain,"
1313,THE SONNETS,"Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find"
1314,THE SONNETS,"Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,"
1315,THE SONNETS,To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
1316,THE SONNETS,"These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,"
1317,THE SONNETS,"Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book."
1318,THE SONNETS,
1319,THE SONNETS,
1320,THE SONNETS,78
1321,THE SONNETS,"So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,"
1322,THE SONNETS,"And found such fair assistance in my verse,"
1323,THE SONNETS,"As every alien pen hath got my use,"
1324,THE SONNETS,And under thee their poesy disperse.
1325,THE SONNETS,"Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,"
1326,THE SONNETS,"And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,"
1327,THE SONNETS,"Have added feathers to the learned's wing,"
1328,THE SONNETS,And given grace a double majesty.
1329,THE SONNETS,"Yet be most proud of that which I compile,"
1330,THE SONNETS,"Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,"
1331,THE SONNETS,"In others' works thou dost but mend the style,"
1332,THE SONNETS,And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
1333,THE SONNETS,"But thou art all my art, and dost advance"
1334,THE SONNETS,"As high as learning, my rude ignorance."
1335,THE SONNETS,
1336,THE SONNETS,
1337,THE SONNETS,79
1338,THE SONNETS,"Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,"
1339,THE SONNETS,"My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,"
1340,THE SONNETS,"But now my gracious numbers are decayed,"
1341,THE SONNETS,And my sick muse doth give an other place.
1342,THE SONNETS,I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
1343,THE SONNETS,"Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,"
1344,THE SONNETS,"Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,"
1345,THE SONNETS,"He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,"
1346,THE SONNETS,"He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,"
1347,THE SONNETS,"From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give"
1348,THE SONNETS,And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
1349,THE SONNETS,"No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live."
1350,THE SONNETS,"Then thank him not for that which he doth say,"
1351,THE SONNETS,"Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay."
1352,THE SONNETS,
1353,THE SONNETS,
1354,THE SONNETS,80
1355,THE SONNETS,"O how I faint when I of you do write,"
1356,THE SONNETS,"Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,"
1357,THE SONNETS,"And in the praise thereof spends all his might,"
1358,THE SONNETS,To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
1359,THE SONNETS,But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
1360,THE SONNETS,"The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,"
1361,THE SONNETS,My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
1362,THE SONNETS,On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
1363,THE SONNETS,"Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,"
1364,THE SONNETS,"Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,"
1365,THE SONNETS,"Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,"
1366,THE SONNETS,"He of tall building, and of goodly pride."
1367,THE SONNETS,"Then if he thrive and I be cast away,"
1368,THE SONNETS,"The worst was this, my love was my decay."
1369,THE SONNETS,
1370,THE SONNETS,
1371,THE SONNETS,81
1372,THE SONNETS,"Or I shall live your epitaph to make,"
1373,THE SONNETS,"Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,"
1374,THE SONNETS,"From hence your memory death cannot take,"
1375,THE SONNETS,Although in me each part will be forgotten.
1376,THE SONNETS,"Your name from hence immortal life shall have,"
1377,THE SONNETS,"Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,"
1378,THE SONNETS,"The earth can yield me but a common grave,"
1379,THE SONNETS,"When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,"
1380,THE SONNETS,"Your monument shall be my gentle verse,"
1381,THE SONNETS,"Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,"
1382,THE SONNETS,"And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,"
1383,THE SONNETS,"When all the breathers of this world are dead,"
1384,THE SONNETS,You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
1385,THE SONNETS,"Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men."
1386,THE SONNETS,
1387,THE SONNETS,
1388,THE SONNETS,82
1389,THE SONNETS,"I grant thou wert not married to my muse,"
1390,THE SONNETS,And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
1391,THE SONNETS,The dedicated words which writers use
1392,THE SONNETS,"Of their fair subject, blessing every book."
1393,THE SONNETS,"Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,"
1394,THE SONNETS,"Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,"
1395,THE SONNETS,"And therefore art enforced to seek anew,"
1396,THE SONNETS,Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
1397,THE SONNETS,"And do so love, yet when they have devised,"
1398,THE SONNETS,"What strained touches rhetoric can lend,"
1399,THE SONNETS,"Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,"
1400,THE SONNETS,"In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend."
1401,THE SONNETS,"And their gross painting might be better used,"
1402,THE SONNETS,"Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused."
1403,THE SONNETS,
1404,THE SONNETS,
1405,THE SONNETS,83
1406,THE SONNETS,"I never saw that you did painting need,"
1407,THE SONNETS,"And therefore to your fair no painting set,"
1408,THE SONNETS,"I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,"
1409,THE SONNETS,That barren tender of a poet's debt:
1410,THE SONNETS,"And therefore have I slept in your report,"
1411,THE SONNETS,"That you your self being extant well might show,"
1412,THE SONNETS,"How far a modern quill doth come too short,"
1413,THE SONNETS,"Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow."
1414,THE SONNETS,"This silence for my sin you did impute,"
1415,THE SONNETS,"Which shall be most my glory being dumb,"
1416,THE SONNETS,"For I impair not beauty being mute,"
1417,THE SONNETS,"When others would give life, and bring a tomb."
1418,THE SONNETS,"There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,"
1419,THE SONNETS,Than both your poets can in praise devise.
1420,THE SONNETS,
1421,THE SONNETS,
1422,THE SONNETS,84
1423,THE SONNETS,"Who is it that says most, which can say more,"
1424,THE SONNETS,"Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?"
1425,THE SONNETS,"In whose confine immured is the store,"
1426,THE SONNETS,Which should example where your equal grew.
1427,THE SONNETS,"Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,"
1428,THE SONNETS,"That to his subject lends not some small glory,"
1429,THE SONNETS,"But he that writes of you, if he can tell,"
1430,THE SONNETS,"That you are you, so dignifies his story."
1431,THE SONNETS,"Let him but copy what in you is writ,"
1432,THE SONNETS,"Not making worse what nature made so clear,"
1433,THE SONNETS,"And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,"
1434,THE SONNETS,Making his style admired every where.
1435,THE SONNETS,"You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,"
1436,THE SONNETS,"Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse."
1437,THE SONNETS,
1438,THE SONNETS,
1439,THE SONNETS,85
1440,THE SONNETS,"My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,"
1441,THE SONNETS,"While comments of your praise richly compiled,"
1442,THE SONNETS,"Reserve their character with golden quill,"
1443,THE SONNETS,And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
1444,THE SONNETS,"I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,"
1445,THE SONNETS,"And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,"
1446,THE SONNETS,"To every hymn that able spirit affords,"
1447,THE SONNETS,In polished form of well refined pen.
1448,THE SONNETS,"Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,"
1449,THE SONNETS,"And to the most of praise add something more,"
1450,THE SONNETS,"But that is in my thought, whose love to you"
1451,THE SONNETS,"(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,"
1452,THE SONNETS,"Then others, for the breath of words respect,"
1453,THE SONNETS,"Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect."
1454,THE SONNETS,
1455,THE SONNETS,
1456,THE SONNETS,86
1457,THE SONNETS,"Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,"
1458,THE SONNETS,"Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,"
1459,THE SONNETS,"That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,"
1460,THE SONNETS,Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
1461,THE SONNETS,"Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,"
1462,THE SONNETS,"Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?"
1463,THE SONNETS,"No, neither he, nor his compeers by night"
1464,THE SONNETS,"Giving him aid, my verse astonished."
1465,THE SONNETS,He nor that affable familiar ghost
1466,THE SONNETS,"Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,"
1467,THE SONNETS,"As victors of my silence cannot boast,"
1468,THE SONNETS,I was not sick of any fear from thence.
1469,THE SONNETS,"But when your countenance filled up his line,"
1470,THE SONNETS,"Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine."
1471,THE SONNETS,
1472,THE SONNETS,
1473,THE SONNETS,87
1474,THE SONNETS,"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,"
1475,THE SONNETS,"And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,"
1476,THE SONNETS,The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
1477,THE SONNETS,My bonds in thee are all determinate.
1478,THE SONNETS,"For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,"
1479,THE SONNETS,And for that riches where is my deserving?
1480,THE SONNETS,"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,"
1481,THE SONNETS,And so my patent back again is swerving.
1482,THE SONNETS,"Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,"
1483,THE SONNETS,"Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,"
1484,THE SONNETS,"So thy great gift upon misprision growing,"
1485,THE SONNETS,"Comes home again, on better judgement making."
1486,THE SONNETS,"Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,"
1487,THE SONNETS,"In sleep a king, but waking no such matter."
1488,THE SONNETS,
1489,THE SONNETS,
1490,THE SONNETS,88
1491,THE SONNETS,"When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,"
1492,THE SONNETS,"And place my merit in the eye of scorn,"
1493,THE SONNETS,"Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,"
1494,THE SONNETS,"And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:"
1495,THE SONNETS,"With mine own weakness being best acquainted,"
1496,THE SONNETS,Upon thy part I can set down a story
1497,THE SONNETS,"Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:"
1498,THE SONNETS,"That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:"
1499,THE SONNETS,"And I by this will be a gainer too,"
1500,THE SONNETS,"For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,"
1501,THE SONNETS,"The injuries that to my self I do,"
1502,THE SONNETS,"Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me."
1503,THE SONNETS,"Such is my love, to thee I so belong,"
1504,THE SONNETS,"That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong."
1505,THE SONNETS,
1506,THE SONNETS,
1507,THE SONNETS,89
1508,THE SONNETS,"Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,"
1509,THE SONNETS,"And I will comment upon that offence,"
1510,THE SONNETS,"Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:"
1511,THE SONNETS,Against thy reasons making no defence.
1512,THE SONNETS,"Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,"
1513,THE SONNETS,"To set a form upon desired change,"
1514,THE SONNETS,"As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,"
1515,THE SONNETS,I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
1516,THE SONNETS,"Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,"
1517,THE SONNETS,"Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,"
1518,THE SONNETS,Lest I (too much profane) should do it wrong:
1519,THE SONNETS,And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
1520,THE SONNETS,"For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,"
1521,THE SONNETS,For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
1522,THE SONNETS,
1523,THE SONNETS,
1524,THE SONNETS,90
1525,THE SONNETS,"Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,"
1526,THE SONNETS,"Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,"
1527,THE SONNETS,"join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,"
1528,THE SONNETS,And do not drop in for an after-loss:
1529,THE SONNETS,"Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,"
1530,THE SONNETS,"Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,"
1531,THE SONNETS,"Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,"
1532,THE SONNETS,To linger out a purposed overthrow.
1533,THE SONNETS,"If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,"
1534,THE SONNETS,"When other petty griefs have done their spite,"
1535,THE SONNETS,"But in the onset come, so shall I taste"
1536,THE SONNETS,At first the very worst of fortune's might.
1537,THE SONNETS,"And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,"
1538,THE SONNETS,"Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so."
1539,THE SONNETS,
1540,THE SONNETS,
1541,THE SONNETS,91
1542,THE SONNETS,"Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,"
1543,THE SONNETS,"Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,"
1544,THE SONNETS,Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
1545,THE SONNETS,"Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse."
1546,THE SONNETS,"And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,"
1547,THE SONNETS,"Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,"
1548,THE SONNETS,"But these particulars are not my measure,"
1549,THE SONNETS,All these I better in one general best.
1550,THE SONNETS,"Thy love is better than high birth to me,"
1551,THE SONNETS,"Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,"
1552,THE SONNETS,Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
1553,THE SONNETS,"And having thee, of all men's pride I boast."
1554,THE SONNETS,"Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,"
1555,THE SONNETS,"All this away, and me most wretchcd make."
1556,THE SONNETS,
1557,THE SONNETS,
1558,THE SONNETS,92
1559,THE SONNETS,"But do thy worst to steal thy self away,"
1560,THE SONNETS,"For term of life thou art assured mine,"
1561,THE SONNETS,"And life no longer than thy love will stay,"
1562,THE SONNETS,For it depends upon that love of thine.
1563,THE SONNETS,"Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,"
1564,THE SONNETS,"When in the least of them my life hath end,"
1565,THE SONNETS,"I see, a better state to me belongs"
1566,THE SONNETS,"Than that, which on thy humour doth depend."
1567,THE SONNETS,"Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,"
1568,THE SONNETS,"Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,"
1569,THE SONNETS,"O what a happy title do I find,"
1570,THE SONNETS,"Happy to have thy love, happy to die!"
1571,THE SONNETS,But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
1572,THE SONNETS,"Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not."

1576,THE SONNETS,"So shall I live, supposing thou art true,"
1577,THE SONNETS,"Like a deceived husband, so love's face,"
1578,THE SONNETS,"May still seem love to me, though altered new:"
1579,THE SONNETS,"Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place."
1580,THE SONNETS,"For there can live no hatred in thine eye,"
1581,THE SONNETS,"Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,"
1582,THE SONNETS,"In many's looks, the false heart's history"
1583,THE SONNETS,Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
1584,THE SONNETS,"But heaven in thy creation did decree,"
1585,THE SONNETS,"That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,"
1586,THE SONNETS,"Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,"
1587,THE SONNETS,"Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell."
1588,THE SONNETS,"How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,"
1589,THE SONNETS,If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
1590,THE SONNETS,
1591,THE SONNETS,
1592,THE SONNETS,94
1593,THE SONNETS,"They that have power to hurt, and will do none,"
1594,THE SONNETS,"That do not do the thing, they most do show,"
1595,THE SONNETS,"Who moving others, are themselves as stone,"
1596,THE SONNETS,"Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:"
1597,THE SONNETS,"They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,"
1598,THE SONNETS,"And husband nature's riches from expense,"
1599,THE SONNETS,"Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,"
1600,THE SONNETS,"Others, but stewards of their excellence:"
1601,THE SONNETS,"The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,"
1602,THE SONNETS,"Though to it self, it only live and die,"
1603,THE SONNETS,"But if that flower with base infection meet,"
1604,THE SONNETS,The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
1605,THE SONNETS,"For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,"
1606,THE SONNETS,"Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds."
1607,THE SONNETS,
1608,THE SONNETS,
1609,THE SONNETS,95
1610,THE SONNETS,"How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,"
1611,THE SONNETS,"Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,"
1612,THE SONNETS,Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
1613,THE SONNETS,O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
1614,THE SONNETS,"That tongue that tells the story of thy days,"
1615,THE SONNETS,(Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
1616,THE SONNETS,"Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,"
1617,THE SONNETS,"Naming thy name, blesses an ill report."
1618,THE SONNETS,"O what a mansion have those vices got,"
1619,THE SONNETS,"Which for their habitation chose out thee,"
1620,THE SONNETS,"Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,"
1621,THE SONNETS,"And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!"
1622,THE SONNETS,"Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,"
1623,THE SONNETS,The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
1624,THE SONNETS,
1625,THE SONNETS,
1626,THE SONNETS,96
1627,THE SONNETS,"Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,"
1628,THE SONNETS,"Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,"
1629,THE SONNETS,Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
1630,THE SONNETS,"Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:"
1631,THE SONNETS,"As on the finger of a throned queen,"
1632,THE SONNETS,The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
1633,THE SONNETS,"So are those errors that in thee are seen,"
1634,THE SONNETS,"To truths translated, and for true things deemed."
1635,THE SONNETS,"How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,"
1636,THE SONNETS,If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
1637,THE SONNETS,"How many gazers mightst thou lead away,"
1638,THE SONNETS,if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
1639,THE SONNETS,"But do not so, I love thee in such sort,"
1640,THE SONNETS,"As thou being mine, mine is thy good report."
1641,THE SONNETS,
1642,THE SONNETS,
1643,THE SONNETS,97
1644,THE SONNETS,How like a winter hath my absence been
1645,THE SONNETS,"From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!"
1646,THE SONNETS,"What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!"
1647,THE SONNETS,What old December's bareness everywhere!
1648,THE SONNETS,"And yet this time removed was summer's time,"
1649,THE SONNETS,"The teeming autumn big with rich increase,"
1650,THE SONNETS,"Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,"
1651,THE SONNETS,Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:
1652,THE SONNETS,Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
1653,THE SONNETS,"But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,"
1654,THE SONNETS,"For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,"
1655,THE SONNETS,"And thou away, the very birds are mute."
1656,THE SONNETS,"Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,"
1657,THE SONNETS,"That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near."
1658,THE SONNETS,
1659,THE SONNETS,
1660,THE SONNETS,98
1661,THE SONNETS,"From you have I been absent in the spring,"
1662,THE SONNETS,When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
1663,THE SONNETS,Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:
1664,THE SONNETS,That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
1665,THE SONNETS,"Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell"
1666,THE SONNETS,"Of different flowers in odour and in hue,"
1667,THE SONNETS,Could make me any summer's story tell:
1668,THE SONNETS,Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
1669,THE SONNETS,"Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,"
1670,THE SONNETS,"Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,"
1671,THE SONNETS,"They were but sweet, but figures of delight:"
1672,THE SONNETS,"Drawn after you, you pattern of all those."
1673,THE SONNETS,"Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,"
1674,THE SONNETS,As with your shadow I with these did play.
1675,THE SONNETS,
1676,THE SONNETS,
1677,THE SONNETS,99
1678,THE SONNETS,"The forward violet thus did I chide,"
1679,THE SONNETS,"Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,"
1680,THE SONNETS,If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
1681,THE SONNETS,"Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,"
1682,THE SONNETS,In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
1683,THE SONNETS,"The lily I condemned for thy hand,"
1684,THE SONNETS,"And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,"
1685,THE SONNETS,"The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,"
1686,THE SONNETS,"One blushing shame, another white despair:"
1687,THE SONNETS,"A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,"
1688,THE SONNETS,"And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,"
1689,THE SONNETS,But for his theft in pride of all his growth
1690,THE SONNETS,A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
1691,THE SONNETS,"More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,"
1692,THE SONNETS,"But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee."
1693,THE SONNETS,
1694,THE SONNETS,
1695,THE SONNETS,100
1696,THE SONNETS,"Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,"
1697,THE SONNETS,To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
1698,THE SONNETS,"Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,"
1699,THE SONNETS,Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
1700,THE SONNETS,"Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,"
1701,THE SONNETS,"In gentle numbers time so idly spent,"
1702,THE SONNETS,"Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,"
1703,THE SONNETS,And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
1704,THE SONNETS,"Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,"
1705,THE SONNETS,"If time have any wrinkle graven there,"
1706,THE SONNETS,"If any, be a satire to decay,"
1707,THE SONNETS,And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
1708,THE SONNETS,"Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,"
1709,THE SONNETS,"So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife."
1710,THE SONNETS,
1711,THE SONNETS,
1712,THE SONNETS,101
1713,THE SONNETS,"O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,"
1714,THE SONNETS,For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
1715,THE SONNETS,Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
1716,THE SONNETS,"So dost thou too, and therein dignified:"
1717,THE SONNETS,"Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,"
1718,THE SONNETS,"'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,"
1719,THE SONNETS,"Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:"
1720,THE SONNETS,"But best is best, if never intermixed'?"
1721,THE SONNETS,"Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?"
1722,THE SONNETS,"Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,"
1723,THE SONNETS,To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
1724,THE SONNETS,And to be praised of ages yet to be.
1725,THE SONNETS,"Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,"
1726,THE SONNETS,"To make him seem long hence, as he shows now."
1727,THE SONNETS,
1728,THE SONNETS,
1729,THE SONNETS,102
1730,THE SONNETS,"My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,"
1731,THE SONNETS,"I love not less, though less the show appear,"
1732,THE SONNETS,"That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,"
1733,THE SONNETS,The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
1734,THE SONNETS,"Our love was new, and then but in the spring,"
1735,THE SONNETS,"When I was wont to greet it with my lays,"
1736,THE SONNETS,"As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,"
1737,THE SONNETS,And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
1738,THE SONNETS,Not that the summer is less pleasant now
1739,THE SONNETS,"Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,"
1740,THE SONNETS,"But that wild music burthens every bough,"
1741,THE SONNETS,And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
1742,THE SONNETS,"Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:"
1743,THE SONNETS,Because I would not dull you with my song.
1744,THE SONNETS,
1745,THE SONNETS,
1746,THE SONNETS,103
1747,THE SONNETS,"Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,"
1748,THE SONNETS,"That having such a scope to show her pride,"
1749,THE SONNETS,The argument all bare is of more worth
1750,THE SONNETS,Than when it hath my added praise beside.
1751,THE SONNETS,O blame me not if I no more can write!
1752,THE SONNETS,"Look in your glass and there appears a face,"
1753,THE SONNETS,"That over-goes my blunt invention quite,"
1754,THE SONNETS,"Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace."
1755,THE SONNETS,"Were it not sinful then striving to mend,"
1756,THE SONNETS,To mar the subject that before was well?
1757,THE SONNETS,"For to no other pass my verses tend,"
1758,THE SONNETS,Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
1759,THE SONNETS,"And more, much more than in my verse can sit,"
1760,THE SONNETS,"Your own glass shows you, when you look in it."
1761,THE SONNETS,
1762,THE SONNETS,
1763,THE SONNETS,104
1764,THE SONNETS,"To me fair friend you never can be old,"
1765,THE SONNETS,"For as you were when first your eye I eyed,"
1766,THE SONNETS,"Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,"
1767,THE SONNETS,"Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,"
1768,THE SONNETS,"Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,"
1769,THE SONNETS,"In process of the seasons have I seen,"
1770,THE SONNETS,"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,"
1771,THE SONNETS,Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.
1772,THE SONNETS,"Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,"
1773,THE SONNETS,"Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,"
1774,THE SONNETS,"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand"
1775,THE SONNETS,"Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived."
1776,THE SONNETS,"For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,"
1777,THE SONNETS,Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
1778,THE SONNETS,
1779,THE SONNETS,
1780,THE SONNETS,105
1781,THE SONNETS,"Let not my love be called idolatry,"
1782,THE SONNETS,"Nor my beloved as an idol show,"
1783,THE SONNETS,Since all alike my songs and praises be
1784,THE SONNETS,"To one, of one, still such, and ever so."
1785,THE SONNETS,"Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,"
1786,THE SONNETS,"Still constant in a wondrous excellence,"
1787,THE SONNETS,"Therefore my verse to constancy confined,"
1788,THE SONNETS,"One thing expressing, leaves out difference."
1789,THE SONNETS,"Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,"
1790,THE SONNETS,"Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,"
1791,THE SONNETS,"And in this change is my invention spent,"
1792,THE SONNETS,"Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords."
1793,THE SONNETS,"Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone."
1794,THE SONNETS,"Which three till now, never kept seat in one."
1795,THE SONNETS,
1796,THE SONNETS,
1797,THE SONNETS,106
1798,THE SONNETS,"When in the chronicle of wasted time,"
1799,THE SONNETS,"I see descriptions of the fairest wights,"
1800,THE SONNETS,"And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,"
1801,THE SONNETS,"In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,"
1802,THE SONNETS,"Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,"
1803,THE SONNETS,"Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,"
1804,THE SONNETS,"I see their antique pen would have expressed,"
1805,THE SONNETS,Even such a beauty as you master now.
1806,THE SONNETS,So all their praises are but prophecies
1807,THE SONNETS,"Of this our time, all you prefiguring,"
1808,THE SONNETS,"And for they looked but with divining eyes,"
1809,THE SONNETS,They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
1810,THE SONNETS,"For we which now behold these present days,"
1811,THE SONNETS,"Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise."
1812,THE SONNETS,
1813,THE SONNETS,
1814,THE SONNETS,107
1815,THE SONNETS,"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,"
1816,THE SONNETS,"Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,"
1817,THE SONNETS,"Can yet the lease of my true love control,"
1818,THE SONNETS,Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
1819,THE SONNETS,"The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,"
1820,THE SONNETS,"And the sad augurs mock their own presage,"
1821,THE SONNETS,"Incertainties now crown themselves assured,"
1822,THE SONNETS,And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
1823,THE SONNETS,"Now with the drops of this most balmy time,"
1824,THE SONNETS,"My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,"
1825,THE SONNETS,"Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,"
1826,THE SONNETS,While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.
1827,THE SONNETS,"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
1828,THE SONNETS,When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
1829,THE SONNETS,
1830,THE SONNETS,
1831,THE SONNETS,108
1832,THE SONNETS,"What's in the brain that ink may character,"
1833,THE SONNETS,"Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,"
1834,THE SONNETS,"What's new to speak, what now to register,"
1835,THE SONNETS,"That may express my love, or thy dear merit?"
1836,THE SONNETS,"Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,"
1837,THE SONNETS,"I must each day say o'er the very same,"
1838,THE SONNETS,"Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,"
1839,THE SONNETS,Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.
1840,THE SONNETS,"So that eternal love in love's fresh case,"
1841,THE SONNETS,"Weighs not the dust and injury of age,"
1842,THE SONNETS,"Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,"
1843,THE SONNETS,"But makes antiquity for aye his page,"
1844,THE SONNETS,"Finding the first conceit of love there bred,"
1845,THE SONNETS,Where time and outward form would show it dead.
1846,THE SONNETS,
1847,THE SONNETS,
1848,THE SONNETS,109
1849,THE SONNETS,"O never say that I was false of heart,"
1850,THE SONNETS,"Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,"
1851,THE SONNETS,"As easy might I from my self depart,"
1852,THE SONNETS,As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
1853,THE SONNETS,"That is my home of love, if I have ranged,"
1854,THE SONNETS,"Like him that travels I return again,"
1855,THE SONNETS,"Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,"
1856,THE SONNETS,"So that my self bring water for my stain,"
1857,THE SONNETS,"Never believe though in my nature reigned,"
1858,THE SONNETS,"All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,"
1859,THE SONNETS,"That it could so preposterously be stained,"
1860,THE SONNETS,To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:
1861,THE SONNETS,"For nothing this wide universe I call,"
1862,THE SONNETS,"Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all."
1863,THE SONNETS,
1864,THE SONNETS,
1865,THE SONNETS,110
1866,THE SONNETS,"Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,"
1867,THE SONNETS,"And made my self a motley to the view,"
1868,THE SONNETS,"Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,"
1869,THE SONNETS,Made old offences of affections new.
1870,THE SONNETS,"Most true it is, that I have looked on truth"
1871,THE SONNETS,"Askance and strangely: but by all above,"
1872,THE SONNETS,"These blenches gave my heart another youth,"
1873,THE SONNETS,And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
1874,THE SONNETS,"Now all is done, have what shall have no end,"
1875,THE SONNETS,Mine appetite I never more will grind
1876,THE SONNETS,"On newer proof, to try an older friend,"
1877,THE SONNETS,"A god in love, to whom I am confined."
1878,THE SONNETS,"Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,"
1879,THE SONNETS,Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
1880,THE SONNETS,
1881,THE SONNETS,
1882,THE SONNETS,111
1883,THE SONNETS,"O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,"
1884,THE SONNETS,"The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
1885,THE SONNETS,"That did not better for my life provide,"
1886,THE SONNETS,Than public means which public manners breeds.
1887,THE SONNETS,"Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,"
1888,THE SONNETS,And almost thence my nature is subdued
1889,THE SONNETS,"To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:"
1890,THE SONNETS,"Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,"
1891,THE SONNETS,"Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,"
1892,THE SONNETS,"Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,"
1893,THE SONNETS,"No bitterness that I will bitter think,"
1894,THE SONNETS,Nor double penance to correct correction.
1895,THE SONNETS,"Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,"
1896,THE SONNETS,Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
1897,THE SONNETS,
1898,THE SONNETS,
1899,THE SONNETS,112
1900,THE SONNETS,"Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,"
1901,THE SONNETS,"Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,"
1902,THE SONNETS,"For what care I who calls me well or ill,"
1903,THE SONNETS,"So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?"
1904,THE SONNETS,"You are my all the world, and I must strive,"
1905,THE SONNETS,"To know my shames and praises from your tongue,"
1906,THE SONNETS,"None else to me, nor I to none alive,"
1907,THE SONNETS,That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
1908,THE SONNETS,In so profound abysm I throw all care
1909,THE SONNETS,"Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,"
1910,THE SONNETS,To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
1911,THE SONNETS,Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
1912,THE SONNETS,"You are so strongly in my purpose bred,"
1913,THE SONNETS,That all the world besides methinks are dead.
1914,THE SONNETS,
1915,THE SONNETS,
1916,THE SONNETS,113
1917,THE SONNETS,"Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,"
1918,THE SONNETS,"And that which governs me to go about,"
1919,THE SONNETS,"Doth part his function, and is partly blind,"
1920,THE SONNETS,"Seems seeing, but effectually is out:"
1921,THE SONNETS,For it no form delivers to the heart
1922,THE SONNETS,"Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,"
1923,THE SONNETS,"Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,"
1924,THE SONNETS,Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
1925,THE SONNETS,"For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,"
1926,THE SONNETS,"The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,"
1927,THE SONNETS,"The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:"
1928,THE SONNETS,"The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature."
1929,THE SONNETS,"Incapable of more, replete with you,"
1930,THE SONNETS,My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
1931,THE SONNETS,
1932,THE SONNETS,
1933,THE SONNETS,114
1934,THE SONNETS,Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
1935,THE SONNETS,Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?
1936,THE SONNETS,"Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,"
1937,THE SONNETS,And that your love taught it this alchemy?
1938,THE SONNETS,"To make of monsters, and things indigest,"
1939,THE SONNETS,"Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,"
1940,THE SONNETS,Creating every bad a perfect best
1941,THE SONNETS,As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
1942,THE SONNETS,"O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,"
1943,THE SONNETS,"And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,"
1944,THE SONNETS,"Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,"
1945,THE SONNETS,And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
1946,THE SONNETS,"If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,"
1947,THE SONNETS,That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
1948,THE SONNETS,
1949,THE SONNETS,
1950,THE SONNETS,115
1951,THE SONNETS,"Those lines that I before have writ do lie,"
1952,THE SONNETS,"Even those that said I could not love you dearer,"
1953,THE SONNETS,"Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,"
1954,THE SONNETS,"My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,"
1955,THE SONNETS,"But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents"
1956,THE SONNETS,"Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,"
1957,THE SONNETS,"Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,"
1958,THE SONNETS,Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:
1959,THE SONNETS,"Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,"
1960,THE SONNETS,"Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'"
1961,THE SONNETS,"When I was certain o'er incertainty,"
1962,THE SONNETS,"Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?"
1963,THE SONNETS,"Love is a babe, then might I not say so"
1964,THE SONNETS,To give full growth to that which still doth grow.
1965,THE SONNETS,
1966,THE SONNETS,
1967,THE SONNETS,116
1968,THE SONNETS,Let me not to the marriage of true minds
1969,THE SONNETS,"Admit impediments, love is not love"
1970,THE SONNETS,"Which alters when it alteration finds,"
1971,THE SONNETS,Or bends with the remover to remove.
1972,THE SONNETS,"O no, it is an ever-fixed mark"
1973,THE SONNETS,That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
1974,THE SONNETS,"It is the star to every wand'ring bark,"
1975,THE SONNETS,"Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
1976,THE SONNETS,"Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
1977,THE SONNETS,"Within his bending sickle's compass come,"
1978,THE SONNETS,"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
1979,THE SONNETS,But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
1980,THE SONNETS,"If this be error and upon me proved,"
1981,THE SONNETS,"I never writ, nor no man ever loved."
1982,THE SONNETS,
1983,THE SONNETS,
1984,THE SONNETS,117
1985,THE SONNETS,"Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,"
1986,THE SONNETS,"Wherein I should your great deserts repay,"
1987,THE SONNETS,"Forgot upon your dearest love to call,"
1988,THE SONNETS,"Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,"
1989,THE SONNETS,"That I have frequent been with unknown minds,"
1990,THE SONNETS,"And given to time your own dear-purchased right,"
1991,THE SONNETS,That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
1992,THE SONNETS,Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
1993,THE SONNETS,"Book both my wilfulness and errors down,"
1994,THE SONNETS,"And on just proof surmise, accumulate,"
1995,THE SONNETS,"Bring me within the level of your frown,"
1996,THE SONNETS,But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
1997,THE SONNETS,Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
1998,THE SONNETS,The constancy and virtue of your love.
1999,THE SONNETS,
2000,THE SONNETS,
2001,THE SONNETS,118
2002,THE SONNETS,Like as to make our appetite more keen
2003,THE SONNETS,"With eager compounds we our palate urge,"
2004,THE SONNETS,"As to prevent our maladies unseen,"
2005,THE SONNETS,We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
2006,THE SONNETS,"Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,"
2007,THE SONNETS,To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
2008,THE SONNETS,"And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,"
2009,THE SONNETS,To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
2010,THE SONNETS,Thus policy in love t' anticipate
2011,THE SONNETS,"The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,"
2012,THE SONNETS,And brought to medicine a healthful state
2013,THE SONNETS,Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
2014,THE SONNETS,"But thence I learn and find the lesson true,"
2015,THE SONNETS,Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.
2016,THE SONNETS,
2017,THE SONNETS,
2018,THE SONNETS,119
2019,THE SONNETS,What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
2020,THE SONNETS,"Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,"
2021,THE SONNETS,"Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,"
2022,THE SONNETS,Still losing when I saw my self to win!
2023,THE SONNETS,"What wretched errors hath my heart committed,"
2024,THE SONNETS,Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
2025,THE SONNETS,How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
2026,THE SONNETS,In the distraction of this madding fever!
2027,THE SONNETS,"O benefit of ill, now I find true"
2028,THE SONNETS,"That better is, by evil still made better."
2029,THE SONNETS,And ruined love when it is built anew
2030,THE SONNETS,"Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater."
2031,THE SONNETS,"So I return rebuked to my content,"
2032,THE SONNETS,And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
2033,THE SONNETS,
2034,THE SONNETS,
2035,THE SONNETS,120
2036,THE SONNETS,"That you were once unkind befriends me now,"
2037,THE SONNETS,"And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,"
2038,THE SONNETS,"Needs must I under my transgression bow,"
2039,THE SONNETS,Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
2040,THE SONNETS,For if you were by my unkindness shaken
2041,THE SONNETS,"As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,"
2042,THE SONNETS,And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
2043,THE SONNETS,To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
2044,THE SONNETS,O that our night of woe might have remembered
2045,THE SONNETS,"My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,"
2046,THE SONNETS,"And soon to you, as you to me then tendered"
2047,THE SONNETS,"The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!"
2048,THE SONNETS,"But that your trespass now becomes a fee,"
2049,THE SONNETS,"Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me."
2050,THE SONNETS,
2051,THE SONNETS,
2052,THE SONNETS,121
2053,THE SONNETS,"'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,"
2054,THE SONNETS,"When not to be, receives reproach of being,"
2055,THE SONNETS,"And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,"
2056,THE SONNETS,"Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing."
2057,THE SONNETS,For why should others' false adulterate eyes
2058,THE SONNETS,Give salutation to my sportive blood?
2059,THE SONNETS,"Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,"
2060,THE SONNETS,Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
2061,THE SONNETS,"No, I am that I am, and they that level"
2062,THE SONNETS,"At my abuses, reckon up their own,"
2063,THE SONNETS,I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
2064,THE SONNETS,"By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown"
2065,THE SONNETS,"Unless this general evil they maintain,"
2066,THE SONNETS,All men are bad and in their badness reign.

2068,THE SONNETS,
2069,THE SONNETS,122
2070,THE SONNETS,"Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain"
2071,THE SONNETS,"Full charactered with lasting memory,"
2072,THE SONNETS,Which shall above that idle rank remain
2073,THE SONNETS,Beyond all date even to eternity.
2074,THE SONNETS,"Or at the least, so long as brain and heart"
2075,THE SONNETS,"Have faculty by nature to subsist,"
2076,THE SONNETS,Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
2077,THE SONNETS,"Of thee, thy record never can be missed:"
2078,THE SONNETS,"That poor retention could not so much hold,"
2079,THE SONNETS,"Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,"
2080,THE SONNETS,"Therefore to give them from me was I bold,"
2081,THE SONNETS,To trust those tables that receive thee more:
2082,THE SONNETS,To keep an adjunct to remember thee
2083,THE SONNETS,Were to import forgetfulness in me.
2084,THE SONNETS,
2085,THE SONNETS,
2086,THE SONNETS,123
2087,THE SONNETS,"No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,"
2088,THE SONNETS,Thy pyramids built up with newer might
2089,THE SONNETS,"To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,"
2090,THE SONNETS,They are but dressings Of a former sight:
2091,THE SONNETS,"Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,"
2092,THE SONNETS,"What thou dost foist upon us that is old,"
2093,THE SONNETS,"And rather make them born to our desire,"
2094,THE SONNETS,Than think that we before have heard them told:
2095,THE SONNETS,"Thy registers and thee I both defy,"
2096,THE SONNETS,"Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,"
2097,THE SONNETS,"For thy records, and what we see doth lie,"
2098,THE SONNETS,Made more or less by thy continual haste:
2099,THE SONNETS,"This I do vow and this shall ever be,"
2100,THE SONNETS,I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.
2101,THE SONNETS,
2102,THE SONNETS,
2103,THE SONNETS,124
2104,THE SONNETS,"If my dear love were but the child of state,"
2105,THE SONNETS,"It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,"
2106,THE SONNETS,"As subject to time's love or to time's hate,"
2107,THE SONNETS,"Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered."
2108,THE SONNETS,"No it was builded far from accident,"
2109,THE SONNETS,"It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls"
2110,THE SONNETS,"Under the blow of thralled discontent,"
2111,THE SONNETS,Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
2112,THE SONNETS,"It fears not policy that heretic,"
2113,THE SONNETS,"Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,"
2114,THE SONNETS,"But all alone stands hugely politic,"
2115,THE SONNETS,"That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers."
2116,THE SONNETS,"To this I witness call the fools of time,"
2117,THE SONNETS,"Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime."
2118,THE SONNETS,
2119,THE SONNETS,
2120,THE SONNETS,125
2121,THE SONNETS,"Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,"
2122,THE SONNETS,"With my extern the outward honouring,"
2123,THE SONNETS,"Or laid great bases for eternity,"
2124,THE SONNETS,Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
2125,THE SONNETS,Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
2126,THE SONNETS,"Lose all, and more by paying too much rent"
2127,THE SONNETS,"For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,"
2128,THE SONNETS,Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
2129,THE SONNETS,"No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,"
2130,THE SONNETS,"And take thou my oblation, poor but free,"
2131,THE SONNETS,"Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,"
2132,THE SONNETS,"But mutual render, only me for thee."
2133,THE SONNETS,"Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul"
2134,THE SONNETS,"When most impeached, stands least in thy control."

2136,THE SONNETS,
2137,THE SONNETS,126
2138,THE SONNETS,"O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,"
2139,THE SONNETS,Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:
2140,THE SONNETS,"Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,"
2141,THE SONNETS,"Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st."
2142,THE SONNETS,If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
2143,THE SONNETS,"As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,"
2144,THE SONNETS,"She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill"
2145,THE SONNETS,"May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill."
2146,THE SONNETS,"Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,"
2147,THE SONNETS,"She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!"
2148,THE SONNETS,"Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,"
2149,THE SONNETS,And her quietus is to render thee.
2150,THE SONNETS,
2151,THE SONNETS,
2152,THE SONNETS,127
2153,THE SONNETS,"In the old age black was not counted fair,"
2154,THE SONNETS,Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:
2155,THE SONNETS,"But now is black beauty's successive heir,"
2156,THE SONNETS,"And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,"
2157,THE SONNETS,"For since each hand hath put on nature's power,"
2158,THE SONNETS,"Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,"
2159,THE SONNETS,"Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,"
2160,THE SONNETS,"But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace."
2161,THE SONNETS,"Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,"
2162,THE SONNETS,"Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,"
2163,THE SONNETS,"At such who not born fair no beauty lack,"
2164,THE SONNETS,"Slandering creation with a false esteem,"
2165,THE SONNETS,"Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,"
2166,THE SONNETS,That every tongue says beauty should look so.
2167,THE SONNETS,
2168,THE SONNETS,
2169,THE SONNETS,128
2170,THE SONNETS,"How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,"
2171,THE SONNETS,Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
2172,THE SONNETS,With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
2173,THE SONNETS,"The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,"
2174,THE SONNETS,"Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,"
2175,THE SONNETS,"To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,"
2176,THE SONNETS,"Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,"
2177,THE SONNETS,At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
2178,THE SONNETS,To be so tickled they would change their state
2179,THE SONNETS,"And situation with those dancing chips,"
2180,THE SONNETS,"O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,"
2181,THE SONNETS,"Making dead wood more blest than living lips,"
2182,THE SONNETS,"Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,"
2183,THE SONNETS,"Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss."
2184,THE SONNETS,
2185,THE SONNETS,
2186,THE SONNETS,129
2187,THE SONNETS,Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
2188,THE SONNETS,"Is lust in action, and till action, lust"
2189,THE SONNETS,"Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,"
2190,THE SONNETS,"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,"
2191,THE SONNETS,"Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,"
2192,THE SONNETS,"Past reason hunted, and no sooner had"
2193,THE SONNETS,"Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,"
2194,THE SONNETS,On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
2195,THE SONNETS,"Mad in pursuit and in possession so,"
2196,THE SONNETS,"Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,"
2197,THE SONNETS,"A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,"
2198,THE SONNETS,Before a joy proposed behind a dream.
2199,THE SONNETS,"All this the world well knows yet none knows well,"
2200,THE SONNETS,To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
2201,THE SONNETS,
2202,THE SONNETS,
2203,THE SONNETS,130
2204,THE SONNETS,"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,"
2205,THE SONNETS,"Coral is far more red, than her lips red,"
2206,THE SONNETS,"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:"
2207,THE SONNETS,"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:"
2208,THE SONNETS,"I have seen roses damasked, red and white,"
2209,THE SONNETS,"But no such roses see I in her cheeks,"
2210,THE SONNETS,"And in some perfumes is there more delight,"
2211,THE SONNETS,Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
2212,THE SONNETS,"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,"
2213,THE SONNETS,That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
2214,THE SONNETS,"I grant I never saw a goddess go,"
2215,THE SONNETS,My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
2216,THE SONNETS,"And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,"
2217,THE SONNETS,As any she belied with false compare.
2218,THE SONNETS,
2219,THE SONNETS,
2220,THE SONNETS,131
2221,THE SONNETS,"Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,"
2222,THE SONNETS,As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
2223,THE SONNETS,For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
2224,THE SONNETS,Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
2225,THE SONNETS,"Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,"
2226,THE SONNETS,Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
2227,THE SONNETS,"To say they err, I dare not be so bold,"
2228,THE SONNETS,Although I swear it to my self alone.
2229,THE SONNETS,"And to be sure that is not false I swear,"
2230,THE SONNETS,"A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,"
2231,THE SONNETS,One on another's neck do witness bear
2232,THE SONNETS,Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
2233,THE SONNETS,"In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,"
2234,THE SONNETS,And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
2235,THE SONNETS,
2236,THE SONNETS,
2237,THE SONNETS,132
2238,THE SONNETS,"Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,"
2239,THE SONNETS,"Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,"
2240,THE SONNETS,"Have put on black, and loving mourners be,"
2241,THE SONNETS,Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
2242,THE SONNETS,And truly not the morning sun of heaven
2243,THE SONNETS,"Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,"
2244,THE SONNETS,Nor that full star that ushers in the even
2245,THE SONNETS,Doth half that glory to the sober west
2246,THE SONNETS,As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
2247,THE SONNETS,O let it then as well beseem thy heart
2248,THE SONNETS,"To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,"
2249,THE SONNETS,And suit thy pity like in every part.
2250,THE SONNETS,"Then will I swear beauty herself is black,"
2251,THE SONNETS,And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
2252,THE SONNETS,
2253,THE SONNETS,
2254,THE SONNETS,133
2255,THE SONNETS,Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
2256,THE SONNETS,For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
2257,THE SONNETS,"Is't not enough to torture me alone,"
2258,THE SONNETS,But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
2259,THE SONNETS,"Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,"
2260,THE SONNETS,"And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,"
2261,THE SONNETS,"Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,"
2262,THE SONNETS,A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
2263,THE SONNETS,"Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,"
2264,THE SONNETS,"But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,"
2265,THE SONNETS,"Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,"
2266,THE SONNETS,Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
2267,THE SONNETS,"And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,"
2268,THE SONNETS,Perforce am thine and all that is in me.
2269,THE SONNETS,
2270,THE SONNETS,
2271,THE SONNETS,134
2272,THE SONNETS,"So now I have confessed that he is thine,"
2273,THE SONNETS,"And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,"
2274,THE SONNETS,"My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,"
2275,THE SONNETS,Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
2276,THE SONNETS,"But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,"
2277,THE SONNETS,"For thou art covetous, and he is kind,"
2278,THE SONNETS,"He learned but surety-like to write for me,"
2279,THE SONNETS,Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
2280,THE SONNETS,"The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,"
2281,THE SONNETS,"Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,"
2282,THE SONNETS,"And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,"
2283,THE SONNETS,So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
2284,THE SONNETS,"Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,"
2285,THE SONNETS,"He pays the whole, and yet am I not free."
2286,THE SONNETS,
2287,THE SONNETS,
2288,THE SONNETS,135
2289,THE SONNETS,"Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,"
2290,THE SONNETS,"And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,"
2291,THE SONNETS,"More than enough am I that vex thee still,"
2292,THE SONNETS,To thy sweet will making addition thus.
2293,THE SONNETS,"Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,"
2294,THE SONNETS,Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
2295,THE SONNETS,"Shall will in others seem right gracious,"
2296,THE SONNETS,And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
2297,THE SONNETS,"The sea all water, yet receives rain still,"
2298,THE SONNETS,"And in abundance addeth to his store,"
2299,THE SONNETS,So thou being rich in will add to thy will
2300,THE SONNETS,One will of mine to make thy large will more.
2301,THE SONNETS,"Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,"
2302,THE SONNETS,"Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'"
2303,THE SONNETS,
2304,THE SONNETS,
2305,THE SONNETS,136
2306,THE SONNETS,"If thy soul check thee that I come so near,"
2307,THE SONNETS,"Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',"
2308,THE SONNETS,"And will thy soul knows is admitted there,"
2309,THE SONNETS,"Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil."
2310,THE SONNETS,"'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,"
2311,THE SONNETS,"Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,"
2312,THE SONNETS,"In things of great receipt with case we prove,"
2313,THE SONNETS,Among a number one is reckoned none.
2314,THE SONNETS,"Then in the number let me pass untold,"
2315,THE SONNETS,"Though in thy store's account I one must be,"
2316,THE SONNETS,"For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,"
2317,THE SONNETS,"That nothing me, a something sweet to thee."
2318,THE SONNETS,"Make but my name thy love, and love that still,"
2319,THE SONNETS,And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
2320,THE SONNETS,
2321,THE SONNETS,
2322,THE SONNETS,137
2323,THE SONNETS,"Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,"
2324,THE SONNETS,That they behold and see not what they see?
2325,THE SONNETS,"They know what beauty is, see where it lies,"
2326,THE SONNETS,"Yet what the best is, take the worst to be."
2327,THE SONNETS,"If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,"
2328,THE SONNETS,"Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,"
2329,THE SONNETS,"Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,"
2330,THE SONNETS,Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
2331,THE SONNETS,"Why should my heart think that a several plot,"
2332,THE SONNETS,Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
2333,THE SONNETS,"Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not"
2334,THE SONNETS,To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
2335,THE SONNETS,"In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,"
2336,THE SONNETS,And to this false plague are they now transferred.
2337,THE SONNETS,
2338,THE SONNETS,
2339,THE SONNETS,138
2340,THE SONNETS,"When my love swears that she is made of truth,"
2341,THE SONNETS,"I do believe her though I know she lies,"
2342,THE SONNETS,"That she might think me some untutored youth,"
2343,THE SONNETS,Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
2344,THE SONNETS,"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,"
2345,THE SONNETS,"Although she knows my days are past the best,"
2346,THE SONNETS,"Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,"
2347,THE SONNETS,On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
2348,THE SONNETS,But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
2349,THE SONNETS,And wherefore say not I that I am old?
2350,THE SONNETS,"O love's best habit is in seeming trust,"
2351,THE SONNETS,"And age in love, loves not to have years told."
2352,THE SONNETS,"Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,"
2353,THE SONNETS,And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
2354,THE SONNETS,
2355,THE SONNETS,
2356,THE SONNETS,139
2357,THE SONNETS,"O call not me to justify the wrong,"
2358,THE SONNETS,"That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,"
2359,THE SONNETS,"Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,"
2360,THE SONNETS,"Use power with power, and slay me not by art,"
2361,THE SONNETS,"Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,"
2362,THE SONNETS,"Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,"
2363,THE SONNETS,What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
2364,THE SONNETS,Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
2365,THE SONNETS,"Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,"
2366,THE SONNETS,"Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,"
2367,THE SONNETS,"And therefore from my face she turns my foes,"
2368,THE SONNETS,That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
2369,THE SONNETS,"Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,"
2370,THE SONNETS,"Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain."
2371,THE SONNETS,
2372,THE SONNETS,
2373,THE SONNETS,140
2374,THE SONNETS,"Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press"
2375,THE SONNETS,My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
2376,THE SONNETS,"Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,"
2377,THE SONNETS,The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
2378,THE SONNETS,"If I might teach thee wit better it were,"
2379,THE SONNETS,"Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,"
2380,THE SONNETS,"As testy sick men when their deaths be near,"
2381,THE SONNETS,No news but health from their physicians know.
2382,THE SONNETS,"For if I should despair I should grow mad,"
2383,THE SONNETS,"And in my madness might speak ill of thee,"
2384,THE SONNETS,"Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,"
2385,THE SONNETS,Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
2386,THE SONNETS,"That I may not be so, nor thou belied,"
2387,THE SONNETS,"Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide."
2388,THE SONNETS,
2389,THE SONNETS,
2390,THE SONNETS,141
2391,THE SONNETS,"In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,"
2392,THE SONNETS,"For they in thee a thousand errors note,"
2393,THE SONNETS,"But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,"
2394,THE SONNETS,Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
2395,THE SONNETS,"Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,"
2396,THE SONNETS,"Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,"
2397,THE SONNETS,"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited"
2398,THE SONNETS,To any sensual feast with thee alone:
2399,THE SONNETS,"But my five wits, nor my five senses can"
2400,THE SONNETS,"Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,"
2401,THE SONNETS,"Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,"
2402,THE SONNETS,Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
2403,THE SONNETS,"Only my plague thus far I count my gain,"
2404,THE SONNETS,"That she that makes me sin, awards me pain."
2405,THE SONNETS,
2406,THE SONNETS,
2407,THE SONNETS,142
2408,THE SONNETS,"Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,"
2409,THE SONNETS,"Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,"
2410,THE SONNETS,"O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,"
2411,THE SONNETS,"And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,"
2412,THE SONNETS,"Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,"
2413,THE SONNETS,"That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,"
2414,THE SONNETS,"And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,"
2415,THE SONNETS,Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
2416,THE SONNETS,"Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,"
2417,THE SONNETS,"Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,"
2418,THE SONNETS,"Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,"
2419,THE SONNETS,Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
2420,THE SONNETS,"If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,"
2421,THE SONNETS,By self-example mayst thou be denied.
2422,THE SONNETS,
2423,THE SONNETS,
2424,THE SONNETS,143
2425,THE SONNETS,"Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,"
2426,THE SONNETS,"One of her feathered creatures broke away,"
2427,THE SONNETS,Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
2428,THE SONNETS,In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
2429,THE SONNETS,"Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,"
2430,THE SONNETS,"Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,"
2431,THE SONNETS,To follow that which flies before her face:
2432,THE SONNETS,Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
2433,THE SONNETS,"So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,"
2434,THE SONNETS,"Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,"
2435,THE SONNETS,But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
2436,THE SONNETS,"And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind."
2437,THE SONNETS,"So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,"
2438,THE SONNETS,If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
2439,THE SONNETS,
2440,THE SONNETS,
2441,THE SONNETS,144
2442,THE SONNETS,"Two loves I have of comfort and despair,"
2443,THE SONNETS,"Which like two spirits do suggest me still,"
2444,THE SONNETS,The better angel is a man right fair:
2445,THE SONNETS,The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
2446,THE SONNETS,"To win me soon to hell my female evil,"
2447,THE SONNETS,"Tempteth my better angel from my side,"
2448,THE SONNETS,And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
2449,THE SONNETS,Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
2450,THE SONNETS,"And whether that my angel be turned fiend,"
2451,THE SONNETS,"Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,"
2452,THE SONNETS,"But being both from me both to each friend,"
2453,THE SONNETS,I guess one angel in another's hell.
2454,THE SONNETS,"Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,"
2455,THE SONNETS,Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
2456,THE SONNETS,
2457,THE SONNETS,
2458,THE SONNETS,145
2459,THE SONNETS,"Those lips that Love's own hand did make,"
2460,THE SONNETS,"Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',"
2461,THE SONNETS,To me that languished for her sake:
2462,THE SONNETS,"But when she saw my woeful state,"
2463,THE SONNETS,"Straight in her heart did mercy come,"
2464,THE SONNETS,"Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,"
2465,THE SONNETS,Was used in giving gentle doom:
2466,THE SONNETS,And taught it thus anew to greet:
2467,THE SONNETS,"'I hate' she altered with an end,"
2468,THE SONNETS,"That followed it as gentle day,"
2469,THE SONNETS,Doth follow night who like a fiend
2470,THE SONNETS,From heaven to hell is flown away.
2471,THE SONNETS,"'I hate', from hate away she threw,"
2472,THE SONNETS,And saved my life saying 'not you'.
2473,THE SONNETS,
2474,THE SONNETS,
2475,THE SONNETS,146
2476,THE SONNETS,"Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,"
2477,THE SONNETS,"My sinful earth these rebel powers array,"
2478,THE SONNETS,Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
2479,THE SONNETS,Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
2480,THE SONNETS,"Why so large cost having so short a lease,"
2481,THE SONNETS,Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
2482,THE SONNETS,Shall worms inheritors of this excess
2483,THE SONNETS,Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
2484,THE SONNETS,"Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,"
2485,THE SONNETS,And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
2486,THE SONNETS,Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
2487,THE SONNETS,"Within be fed, without be rich no more,"
2488,THE SONNETS,"So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,"
2489,THE SONNETS,"And death once dead, there's no more dying then."
2490,THE SONNETS,
2491,THE SONNETS,
2492,THE SONNETS,147
2493,THE SONNETS,"My love is as a fever longing still,"
2494,THE SONNETS,"For that which longer nurseth the disease,"
2495,THE SONNETS,"Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,"
2496,THE SONNETS,Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:
2497,THE SONNETS,"My reason the physician to my love,"
2498,THE SONNETS,Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
2499,THE SONNETS,"Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,"
2500,THE SONNETS,"Desire is death, which physic did except."
2501,THE SONNETS,"Past cure I am, now reason is past care,"
2502,THE SONNETS,"And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,"
2503,THE SONNETS,"My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,"
2504,THE SONNETS,At random from the truth vainly expressed.
2505,THE SONNETS,"For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,"
2506,THE SONNETS,"Who art as black as hell, as dark as night."
2507,THE SONNETS,
2508,THE SONNETS,
2509,THE SONNETS,148
2510,THE SONNETS,"O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,"
2511,THE SONNETS,"Which have no correspondence with true sight,"
2512,THE SONNETS,"Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,"
2513,THE SONNETS,That censures falsely what they see aright?
2514,THE SONNETS,"If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,"
2515,THE SONNETS,What means the world to say it is not so?
2516,THE SONNETS,"If it be not, then love doth well denote,"
2517,THE SONNETS,"Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,"
2518,THE SONNETS,"How can it? O how can love's eye be true,"
2519,THE SONNETS,That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
2520,THE SONNETS,"No marvel then though I mistake my view,"
2521,THE SONNETS,"The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears."
2522,THE SONNETS,"O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,"
2523,THE SONNETS,Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
2524,THE SONNETS,
2525,THE SONNETS,
2526,THE SONNETS,149
2527,THE SONNETS,"Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,"
2528,THE SONNETS,When I against my self with thee partake?
2529,THE SONNETS,Do I not think on thee when I forgot
2530,THE SONNETS,"Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?"
2531,THE SONNETS,"Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,"
2532,THE SONNETS,"On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,"
2533,THE SONNETS,Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
2534,THE SONNETS,Revenge upon my self with present moan?
2535,THE SONNETS,"What merit do I in my self respect,"
2536,THE SONNETS,"That is so proud thy service to despise,"
2537,THE SONNETS,"When all my best doth worship thy defect,"
2538,THE SONNETS,Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
2539,THE SONNETS,"But love hate on for now I know thy mind,"
2540,THE SONNETS,"Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind."
2541,THE SONNETS,
2542,THE SONNETS,
2543,THE SONNETS,150
2544,THE SONNETS,"O from what power hast thou this powerful might,"
2545,THE SONNETS,"With insufficiency my heart to sway,"
2546,THE SONNETS,"To make me give the lie to my true sight,"
2547,THE SONNETS,And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
2548,THE SONNETS,"Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,"
2549,THE SONNETS,"That in the very refuse of thy deeds,"
2550,THE SONNETS,"There is such strength and warrantise of skill,"
2551,THE SONNETS,That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
2552,THE SONNETS,"Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,"
2553,THE SONNETS,The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
2554,THE SONNETS,"O though I love what others do abhor,"
2555,THE SONNETS,With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
2556,THE SONNETS,"If thy unworthiness raised love in me,"
2557,THE SONNETS,More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
2558,THE SONNETS,
2559,THE SONNETS,
2560,THE SONNETS,151
2561,THE SONNETS,"Love is too young to know what conscience is,"
2562,THE SONNETS,Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
2563,THE SONNETS,"Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,"
2564,THE SONNETS,Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
2565,THE SONNETS,"For thou betraying me, I do betray"
2566,THE SONNETS,"My nobler part to my gross body's treason,"
2567,THE SONNETS,"My soul doth tell my body that he may,"
2568,THE SONNETS,"Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,"
2569,THE SONNETS,"But rising at thy name doth point out thee,"
2570,THE SONNETS,"As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,"
2571,THE SONNETS,"He is contented thy poor drudge to be,"
2572,THE SONNETS,"To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side."
2573,THE SONNETS,"No want of conscience hold it that I call,"
2574,THE SONNETS,"Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall."
2575,THE SONNETS,
2576,THE SONNETS,
2577,THE SONNETS,152
2578,THE SONNETS,"In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,"
2579,THE SONNETS,"But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,"
2580,THE SONNETS,"In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,"
2581,THE SONNETS,In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
2582,THE SONNETS,"But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,"
2583,THE SONNETS,"When I break twenty? I am perjured most,"
2584,THE SONNETS,For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
2585,THE SONNETS,And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
2586,THE SONNETS,For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
2587,THE SONNETS,"Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,"
2588,THE SONNETS,"And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,"
2589,THE SONNETS,Or made them swear against the thing they see.
2590,THE SONNETS,"For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,"
2591,THE SONNETS,To swear against the truth so foul a be.

2595,THE SONNETS,"Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,"
2596,THE SONNETS,"A maid of Dian's this advantage found,"
2597,THE SONNETS,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
2598,THE SONNETS,In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
2599,THE SONNETS,"Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,"
2600,THE SONNETS,"A dateless lively heat still to endure,"
2601,THE SONNETS,"And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,"
2602,THE SONNETS,Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:
2603,THE SONNETS,"But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,"
2604,THE SONNETS,"The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,"
2605,THE SONNETS,"I sick withal the help of bath desired,"
2606,THE SONNETS,And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
2607,THE SONNETS,"But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,"
2608,THE SONNETS,Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

2612,THE SONNETS,"The little Love-god lying once asleep,"
2613,THE SONNETS,"Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,"
2614,THE SONNETS,"Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,"
2615,THE SONNETS,"Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,"
2616,THE SONNETS,"The fairest votary took up that fire,"
2617,THE SONNETS,"Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,"
2618,THE SONNETS,"And so the general of hot desire,"
2619,THE SONNETS,Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
2620,THE SONNETS,"This brand she quenched in a cool well by,"
2621,THE SONNETS,"Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,"
2622,THE SONNETS,"Growing a bath and healthful remedy,"
2623,THE SONNETS,"For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,"
2624,THE SONNETS,"Came there for cure and this by that I prove,"
2625,THE SONNETS,"Love's fire heats water, water cools not love."
