17,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,This etext is a Latin-1 file. The original work contained a few phrases
18,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,or lines of Greek text. These are represented here as Beta-code
19,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"transliterations, for example [Greek: tragos]. The original text used a"
20,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,few other characters not found in the Latin-1 character set. These have
21,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"been represented using bracket notation, as follows: [)a], [)e], [)s]"
22,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,and [)z] represent letters with a breve (curved line) above; [=a] and
23,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,[=u] represent letters with a macron (straight line) above. In a few
24,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"places, a single superscript is shown by a caret, and two superscript"
25,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"letters by carets, as in J^n 10^th^."
26,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
27,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
28,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"indexed with arabic numbers (as [17], [221]) are informational. Note"
29,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,text in square brackets is the work of editor E. H. Coleridge.
30,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,Unbracketed note text is from earlier editions and is by a preceding
31,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"editor or Byron himself. Footnotes indexed with letters (as [c], [bf])"
32,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,document variant forms of the text from manuscripts and other sources.
33,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
34,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"In the original, footnotes are printed at the foot of the page on which"
35,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"they are referenced, and their indices start over on each page. Here,"
36,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"footnotes are collected at the ends of each play or poem, and are"
37,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,numbered consecutively throughout. Within the blocks of footnotes are
38,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,numbers in braces: {321}. These represent the page number on which
39,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,following notes originally appeared. To find a note that was originally
40,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"printed on page 27, search for {27}."

74,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.
75,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,
76,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,The plays and poems contained in this volume were written within the
77,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,space of two years--the last two years of Byron's career as a poet. But
78,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"that was not all. Cantos VI.-XV. of _Don Juan_, _The Vision of"
79,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"Judgment_, _The Blues_, _The Irish Avatar_, and other minor poems,"
80,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"belong to the same period. The end was near, and, as though he had"
81,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"received a warning, he hastened to make the roll complete."
82,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,
83,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"Proof is impossible, but the impression remains that the greater part of"
84,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,this volume has been passed over and left unread by at least two
85,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"generations of readers. Old play-goers recall Macready as ""Werner,"" and"
86,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"many persons have read _Cain_; but apart from students of literature,"
87,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,readers of _Sardanapalus_ and of _The Two Foscari_ are rare; of _The Age
88,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,of Bronze_ and _The Island_ rarer still. A few of Byron's later poems
89,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"have shared the fate of Southey's epics; and, yet, with something of"
90,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"Southey's persistence, Byron believed that posterity would weigh his"
91,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"""regular dramas"" in a fresh balance, and that his heedless critics"
92,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"would kick the beam. But ""can these bones live""? Can dramas which"
93,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,excited the wondering admiration of Goethe and Lamartine and Sir Walter
94,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,Scott touch or lay hold of the more adventurous reader of the present
95,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,day? It is certain that even the half-forgotten works of a great and
96,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"still popular poet, which have left their mark on the creative"
97,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"imagination of the poets and playwrights of three quarters of a century,"
98,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"will always be studied by the few from motives of curiosity, or for"
99,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"purposes of reference; but it is improbable, though not impossible, that"
100,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"in the revolution of taste and sentiment, moribund or extinct poetry"
101,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,will be born again into the land of the living. Poetry which has never
102,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"had its day, such as Blake's _Songs of Innocence_, the _Lyrical"
103,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"Ballads_, or Fitzgerald's _Omar Khayyám_, may come, in due time, to be"
104,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,recognized at its full worth; but it is a harder matter for a poem which
105,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,has lost its vogue to recapture the interest and enthusiasm of the many.
106,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,
107,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,Byron is only an instance in point. Bygone poetry has little or no
108,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,attraction for modern readers. This poem or that drama may be referred
109,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"to, and occasionally examined in the interests of general culture, or in"
110,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"support of a particular belief or line of conduct, as a classical or"
111,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"quasi-scriptural authority; but, with the rarest exceptions, plays and"
112,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,narrative poems are not read spontaneously or with any genuine
113,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,satisfaction or delight. An old-world poem which will not yield up its
114,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"secret to the idle _reader_ ""of an empty day"" is more or less ""rudely"
115,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"dismissed,"" without even a show of favour or hospitality."
116,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,
117,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,And yet these forgotten works of the imagination are full of hidden
118,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"treasures! There is not one of Byron's ""impressionist studies"" of"
119,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"striking episodes of history or historical legend, flung, as it were,"
120,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"with a ""Take it or leave it"" in the face of friend or foe, which does"
121,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"not transform names and shadows into persons and substance, which does"
122,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,not contain lines and passages of unquestionable beauty and distinction.
123,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,
124,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"But some would have it that Byron's plays, as a whole, are dull and"
125,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"uninspiring, monotonous harpings on worn-out themes, which every one has"
126,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"mastered or wishes to forget. A close study of the text, together with"
127,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,some knowledge of the subject as it presented itself to the author and
128,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"arrested _his_ attention, may compel these impatient critics to a"
129,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,different conclusion. Byron did not scruple to refer the reader to his
130,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"""sources,"" and was at pains to publish, in the notes and appendices to"
131,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"his dramas and poems, long extracts from old chronicles, from Plutarch's"
132,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"_Lives_, from French and Italian histories, which he had read himself,"
133,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"and, as he fondly believed, would be read by others, who were willing to"
134,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,submit themselves to his guidance. He expected his readers to take some
135,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,trouble and to display some intelligence.
136,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,
137,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,Poetry is successful only so far as it is intelligible. To a clear cry
138,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"an answer comes, but not to a muffled call. The reader who comes within"
139,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"speaking distance of his author can hear him, and to bring the living"
140,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"within speaking distance of the dead, the living must know the facts,"
141,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,and understand the ideas which informed and inspired the dead. Thought
142,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"and attention are scarcely to be reckoned among necromantic arts, but"
143,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"thought and knowledge ""can make these bones live,"" and stand upon their"
144,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"feet, if they do not leap and sing."
145,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,
146,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,I desire to renew my acknowledgments of the generous assistance of the
147,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"officials of the British Museum, and, more especially, of Mr. Ernest"
148,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"Wallis Budge, Litt.D., M.A., _Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian"
149,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"Antiquities_; of Mr. Leonard W. King, M.A., of the same department; and"

152,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"To Dr. Garnett, C.B., I am greatly indebted for invaluable hints and"
153,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure passages
154,PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.,"in _The Age of Bronze_ and other parts of the volume, and for reading"

429,PREFACE,"In publishing the following Tragedies[3] I have only to repeat, that"
430,PREFACE,they were not composed with the most remote view to the stage. On the
431,PREFACE,"attempt made by the managers in a former instance, the public opinion"
432,PREFACE,"has been already expressed. With regard to my own private feelings, as"
433,PREFACE,"it seems that they are to stand for nothing, I shall say nothing."

438,PREFACE,"The Author has in one instance attempted to preserve, and in the other"
439,PREFACE,"to approach, the ""unities;"" conceiving that with any very distant"
440,PREFACE,"departure from them, there may be poetry, but can be no drama. He is"
441,PREFACE,aware of the unpopularity of this notion in present English literature;
442,PREFACE,"but it is not a system of his own, being merely an opinion, which, not"
443,PREFACE,"very long ago, was the law of literature throughout the world, and is"
444,PREFACE,"still so in the more civilised parts of it. But ""nous avons changé tout"
445,PREFACE,"cela,"" and are reaping the advantages of the change. The writer is far"
446,PREFACE,from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or
447,PREFACE,"example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular predecessors:"
448,PREFACE,he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation
449,PREFACE,"of a structure, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules"
450,PREFACE,"whatsoever. Where he has failed, the failure is in the architect,--and"
451,PREFACE,not in the art.
452,PREFACE,
453,PREFACE,In this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of
454,PREFACE,"Diodorus Siculus;[4] reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity"
455,PREFACE,"as I best could, and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose"
456,PREFACE,"the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy,"
457,PREFACE,instead of the long war of the history.

584,SCENE II.,_Sar._ My Lord!--my Life! why answerest thou so coldly?
585,SCENE II.,It is the curse of kings to be so answered.
586,SCENE II.,"Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine--say, wouldst thou"
587,SCENE II.,"Accompany our guests, or charm away"
588,SCENE II.,The moments from me?
589,SCENE II.,
590,SCENE II.,_Myr._              The King's choice is mine.
591,SCENE II.,
592,SCENE II.,_Sar._ I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy                      20
593,SCENE II.,Is to contribute to thine every wish.
594,SCENE II.,"I do not dare to breathe my own desire,"
595,SCENE II.,Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still
596,SCENE II.,Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.
597,SCENE II.,
598,SCENE II.,_Myr._ I would remain: I have no happiness
599,SCENE II.,Save in beholding thine; yet--
600,SCENE II.,
601,SCENE II.,_Sar._                         Yet! what YET?
602,SCENE II.,Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier
603,SCENE II.,Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.
604,SCENE II.,
605,SCENE II.,_Myr._ I think the present is the wonted hour
606,SCENE II.,Of council; it were better I retire.                                30
607,SCENE II.,
608,SCENE II.,_Sal._ (_comes forward and says_)
609,SCENE II.,The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.
610,SCENE II.,
611,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Who answers? How now, brother?"
612,SCENE II.,
613,SCENE II.,"_Sal._                               The _Queen's_ brother,"
614,SCENE II.,"And your most faithful vassal, royal Lord."
615,SCENE II.,
616,SCENE II.,_Sar._ (_addressing his train_).
617,SCENE II.,"As I have said, let all dispose their hours"
618,SCENE II.,"Till midnight, when again we pray your presence."
619,SCENE II.,[_The court retiring_.
620,SCENE II.,"(_To_ MYRRHA,[c] _who is going_.)"
621,SCENE II.,Myrrha! I thought _thou_ wouldst remain.
622,SCENE II.,
623,SCENE II.,"_Myr._                                  Great King,"
624,SCENE II.,Thou didst not say so.
625,SCENE II.,
626,SCENE II.,_Sar._                 But _thou_ looked'st it:
627,SCENE II.,"I know each glance of those Ionic eyes,[d]"
628,SCENE II.,Which said thou wouldst not leave me.
629,SCENE II.,
630,SCENE II.,_Myr._                               Sire! your brother----
631,SCENE II.,
632,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ His _Consort's_ brother, minion of Ionia!                    40"
633,SCENE II.,How darest _thou_ name _me_ and not blush?
634,SCENE II.,
635,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                    Not blush!
636,SCENE II.,Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson
637,SCENE II.,"Like to the dying day on Caucasus,"
638,SCENE II.,"Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows,"
639,SCENE II.,"And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness,"
640,SCENE II.,"Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?"
641,SCENE II.,
642,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one,"
643,SCENE II.,And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.
644,SCENE II.,
645,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Curséd be he who caused those tears to flow!
646,SCENE II.,
647,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Curse not thyself--millions do that already.                 50
648,SCENE II.,
649,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember
650,SCENE II.,I am a monarch.
651,SCENE II.,
652,SCENE II.,_Sal._          Would thou couldst!
653,SCENE II.,
654,SCENE II.,"_Myr._                               My sovereign,"
655,SCENE II.,"I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence."
656,SCENE II.,
657,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Since it must be so, and this churl has checked"
658,SCENE II.,"Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect"
659,SCENE II.,That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose
660,SCENE II.,An empire than thy presence.                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.
661,SCENE II.,
662,SCENE II.,"_Sal._                       It may be,"
663,SCENE II.,Thou wilt lose both--and both for ever!
664,SCENE II.,
665,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                  Brother!
666,SCENE II.,"I can at least command myself, who listen"
667,SCENE II.,To language such as this: yet urge me not                           60
668,SCENE II.,Beyond my easy nature.
669,SCENE II.,
670,SCENE II.,_Sal._                 'Tis beyond
671,SCENE II.,"That easy--far too easy--idle nature,"
672,SCENE II.,Which I would urge thee. O that I could rouse thee!
673,SCENE II.,Though 'twere against myself.
674,SCENE II.,
675,SCENE II.,_Sar._                        By the god Baal!
676,SCENE II.,The man would make me tyrant.
677,SCENE II.,
678,SCENE II.,_Sal._                        So thou art.
679,SCENE II.,Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that
680,SCENE II.,"Of blood and chains? The despotism of vice,"
681,SCENE II.,"The weakness and the wickedness of luxury,"
682,SCENE II.,"The negligence, the apathy, the evils"
683,SCENE II.,"Of sensual sloth--produce ten thousand tyrants,                     70"
684,SCENE II.,Whose delegated cruelty surpasses
685,SCENE II.,"The worst acts of one energetic master,"
686,SCENE II.,However harsh and hard in his own bearing.
687,SCENE II.,The false and fond examples of thy lusts
688,SCENE II.,"Corrupt no less than they oppress, and sap"
689,SCENE II.,In the same moment all thy pageant power
690,SCENE II.,And those who should sustain it; so that whether
691,SCENE II.,"A foreign foe invade, or civil broil"
692,SCENE II.,"Distract within, both will alike prove fatal:"
693,SCENE II.,The first thy subjects have no heart to conquer;                    80
694,SCENE II.,The last they rather would assist than vanquish.
695,SCENE II.,
696,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Why, what makes thee the mouth-piece of the people?"
697,SCENE II.,
698,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ Forgiveness of the Queen, my sister wrongs;"
699,SCENE II.,A natural love unto my infant nephews;
700,SCENE II.,"Faith to the King, a faith he may need shortly,"
701,SCENE II.,In more than words; respect for Nimrod's line;
702,SCENE II.,"Also, another thing thou knowest not."
703,SCENE II.,
704,SCENE II.,_Sar._ What's that?
705,SCENE II.,
706,SCENE II.,_Sal._               To thee an unknown word.
707,SCENE II.,
708,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                        Yet speak it;
709,SCENE II.,I love to learn.
710,SCENE II.,
711,SCENE II.,_Sal._           Virtue.
712,SCENE II.,
713,SCENE II.,_Sar._                  Not know the word!
714,SCENE II.,Never was word yet rung so in my ears--                             90
715,SCENE II.,"Worse than the rabble's shout, or splitting trumpet:"
716,SCENE II.,I've heard thy sister talk of nothing else.
717,SCENE II.,
718,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ To change the irksome theme, then, hear of vice."
719,SCENE II.,
720,SCENE II.,_Sar._ From whom?
721,SCENE II.,
722,SCENE II.,"_Sal._             Even from the winds, if thou couldst listen"
723,SCENE II.,Unto the echoes of the Nation's voice.
724,SCENE II.,
725,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Come, I'm indulgent, as thou knowest, patient,"
726,SCENE II.,"As thou hast often proved--speak out, what moves thee?"
727,SCENE II.,
728,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Thy peril.
729,SCENE II.,
730,SCENE II.,_Sar._             Say on.
731,SCENE II.,
732,SCENE II.,"_Sal._                     Thus, then: all the nations,"
733,SCENE II.,"For they are many, whom thy father left"
734,SCENE II.,"In heritage, are loud in wrath against thee.                       100"
735,SCENE II.,
736,SCENE II.,_Sar._ 'Gainst _me!!_ What would the slaves?
737,SCENE II.,
738,SCENE II.,_Sal._                                         A king.
739,SCENE II.,
740,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                                 And what
741,SCENE II.,Am I then?
742,SCENE II.,
743,SCENE II.,_Sal._     In their eyes a nothing; but
744,SCENE II.,In mine a man who might be something still.
745,SCENE II.,
746,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ The railing drunkards! why, what would they have?"
747,SCENE II.,Have they not peace and plenty?
748,SCENE II.,
749,SCENE II.,_Sal._                          Of the first
750,SCENE II.,"More than is glorious: of the last, far less"
751,SCENE II.,Than the King recks of.
752,SCENE II.,
753,SCENE II.,"_Sar._                  Whose then is the crime,"
754,SCENE II.,"But the false satraps, who provide no better?"
755,SCENE II.,
756,SCENE II.,_Sal._ And somewhat in the Monarch who ne'er looks
757,SCENE II.,"Beyond his palace walls, or if he stirs                            110"
758,SCENE II.,"Beyond them, 'tis but to some mountain palace,"
759,SCENE II.,Till summer heats wear down. O glorious Baal!
760,SCENE II.,"Who built up this vast empire, and wert made"
761,SCENE II.,"A God, or at the least shinest like a God"
762,SCENE II.,"Through the long centuries of thy renown,"
763,SCENE II.,"This, thy presumed descendant, ne'er beheld"
764,SCENE II.,"As king the kingdoms thou didst leave as hero,"
765,SCENE II.,"Won with thy blood, and toil, and time, and peril!"
766,SCENE II.,"For what? to furnish imposts for a revel,"
767,SCENE II.,Or multiplied extortions for a minion.                             120
768,SCENE II.,
769,SCENE II.,_Sar._ I understand thee--thou wouldst have me go
770,SCENE II.,Forth as a conqueror. By all the stars
771,SCENE II.,Which the Chaldeans read--the restless slaves[e]
772,SCENE II.,"Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes,"
773,SCENE II.,And lead them forth to glory.
774,SCENE II.,
775,SCENE II.,_Sal._                       Wherefore not?
776,SCENE II.,Semiramis--a woman only--led
777,SCENE II.,These our Assyrians to the solar shores
778,SCENE II.,Of Ganges.
779,SCENE II.,
780,SCENE II.,_Sar._    Tis most true. And _how_ returned?
781,SCENE II.,
782,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ Why, like a _man_--a hero; baffled, but"
783,SCENE II.,"Not vanquished. With but twenty guards, she made                   130"
784,SCENE II.,Good her retreat to Bactria.
785,SCENE II.,
786,SCENE II.,_Sar._                       And how many
787,SCENE II.,Left she behind in India to the vultures?
788,SCENE II.,
789,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Our annals say not.
790,SCENE II.,
791,SCENE II.,_Sar._                    Then I will say for them--
792,SCENE II.,That she had better woven within her palace
793,SCENE II.,"Some twenty garments, than with twenty guards"
794,SCENE II.,"Have fled to Bactria, leaving to the ravens,"
795,SCENE II.,"And wolves, and men--the fiercer of the three,"
796,SCENE II.,Her myriads of fond subjects. Is _this_ Glory?
797,SCENE II.,Then let me live in ignominy ever.
798,SCENE II.,
799,SCENE II.,_Sal._ All warlike spirits have not the same fate.                 140
800,SCENE II.,"Semiramis, the glorious parent of"
801,SCENE II.,"A hundred kings, although she failed in India,"
802,SCENE II.,Brought Persia--Media--Bactria--to the realm
803,SCENE II.,Which she once swayed--and thou _mightst_ sway.
804,SCENE II.,
805,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                         _I sway_ them--
806,SCENE II.,She but subdued them.
807,SCENE II.,
808,SCENE II.,_Sal._                It may be ere long
809,SCENE II.,That they will need her sword more than your sceptre.
810,SCENE II.,
811,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ There was a certain Bacchus, was there not?"
812,SCENE II.,I've heard my Greek girls speak of such--they say
813,SCENE II.,"He was a God, that is, a Grecian god,"
814,SCENE II.,"An idol foreign to Assyria's worship,                              150"
815,SCENE II.,Who conquered this same golden realm of Ind
816,SCENE II.,"Thou prat'st of, where Semiramis was vanquished."
817,SCENE II.,
818,SCENE II.,_Sal._ I have heard of such a man; and thou perceiv'st
819,SCENE II.,That he is deemed a God for what he did.
820,SCENE II.,
821,SCENE II.,_Sar._ And in his godship I will honour him--
822,SCENE II.,"Not much as man. What, ho! my cupbearer!"
823,SCENE II.,
824,SCENE II.,_Sal._ What means the King?
825,SCENE II.,
826,SCENE II.,_Sar._                     To worship your new God
827,SCENE II.,"And ancient conqueror. Some wine, I say."
828,SCENE II.,
829,SCENE II.,_Enter Cupbearer_.
830,SCENE II.,
831,SCENE II.,_Sar._ (_addressing the Cupbearer_).
832,SCENE II.,"Bring me the golden goblet thick with gems,"
833,SCENE II.,"Which bears the name of Nimrod's chalice. Hence,                   160"
834,SCENE II.,"Fill full, and bear it quickly.                     [_Exit Cupbearer_."
835,SCENE II.,
836,SCENE II.,_Sal._                         Is this moment
837,SCENE II.,A fitting one for the resumption of
838,SCENE II.,Thy yet unslept-off revels?
839,SCENE II.,
840,SCENE II.,"_Re-enter Cupbearer, with wine_."
841,SCENE II.,
842,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ (_taking the cup from him_). Noble kinsman,"
843,SCENE II.,If these barbarian Greeks of the far shores
844,SCENE II.,"And skirts of these our realms lie not, this Bacchus"
845,SCENE II.,"Conquered the whole of India,[8] did he not?"
846,SCENE II.,
847,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ He did, and thence was deemed a Deity.[f]"
848,SCENE II.,
849,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Not so:--of all his conquests a few columns.[9]
850,SCENE II.,"Which may be his, and might be mine, if I"
851,SCENE II.,"Thought them worth purchase and conveyance, are                    170"
852,SCENE II.,"The landmarks of the seas of gore he shed,"
853,SCENE II.,"The realms he wasted, and the hearts he broke."
854,SCENE II.,But here--here in this goblet is his title
855,SCENE II.,To immortality--the immortal grape
856,SCENE II.,"From which he first expressed the soul, and gave"
857,SCENE II.,"To gladden that of man, as some atonement"
858,SCENE II.,For the victorious mischiefs he had done.
859,SCENE II.,"Had it not been for this, he would have been"
860,SCENE II.,A mortal still in name as in his grave;
861,SCENE II.,"And, like my ancestor Semiramis,                                   180"
862,SCENE II.,A sort of semi-glorious human monster.
863,SCENE II.,Here's that which deified him--let it now
864,SCENE II.,"Humanise thee; my surly, chiding brother,"
865,SCENE II.,Pledge me to the Greek God!
866,SCENE II.,
867,SCENE II.,_Sal._                      For all thy realms
868,SCENE II.,I would not so blaspheme our country's creed.
869,SCENE II.,
870,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ That is to say, thou thinkest him a hero,"
871,SCENE II.,"That he shed blood by oceans; and no God,"
872,SCENE II.,"Because he turned a fruit to an enchantment,"
873,SCENE II.,"Which cheers the sad, revives the old, inspires"
874,SCENE II.,"The young, makes Weariness forget his toil,                        190"
875,SCENE II.,And Fear her danger; opens a new world
876,SCENE II.,"When this, the present, palls. Well, then _I_ pledge thee"
877,SCENE II.,"And _him_ as a true man, who did his utmost"
878,SCENE II.,In good or evil to surprise mankind.                        [_Drinks_.
879,SCENE II.,
880,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Wilt thou resume a revel at this hour?
881,SCENE II.,
882,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ And if I did, 'twere better than a trophy,"
883,SCENE II.,Being bought without a tear. But that is not
884,SCENE II.,"My present purpose: since thou wilt not pledge me,"
885,SCENE II.,Continue what thou pleasest.
886,SCENE II.,"(_To the Cupbearer_.)       Boy, retire.            [_Exit Cupbearer_."
887,SCENE II.,
888,SCENE II.,_Sal._ I would but have recalled thee from thy dream;              200
889,SCENE II.,Better by me awakened than rebellion.
890,SCENE II.,
891,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Who should rebel? or why? what cause? pretext?
892,SCENE II.,"I am the lawful King, descended from"
893,SCENE II.,A race of Kings who knew no predecessors.
894,SCENE II.,"What have I done to thee, or to the people,"
895,SCENE II.,"That thou shouldst rail, or they rise up against me?"
896,SCENE II.,
897,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ Of what thou hast done to me, I speak not."
898,SCENE II.,
899,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                             But
900,SCENE II.,Thou think'st that I have wronged the Queen: is't not so?
901,SCENE II.,
902,SCENE II.,_Sal._ _Think!_ Thou hast wronged her!
903,SCENE II.,
904,SCENE II.,"_Sar._                                 Patience, Prince, and hear me."
905,SCENE II.,"She has all power and splendour of her station,                    210"
906,SCENE II.,"Respect, the tutelage of Assyria's heirs,"
907,SCENE II.,The homage and the appanage of sovereignty.
908,SCENE II.,"I married her as monarchs wed--for state,"
909,SCENE II.,And loved her as most husbands love their wives.
910,SCENE II.,If she or thou supposedst I could link me
911,SCENE II.,"Like a Chaldean peasant to his mate,"
912,SCENE II.,Ye knew nor me--nor monarchs--nor mankind.
913,SCENE II.,
914,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ I pray thee, change the theme: my blood disdains"
915,SCENE II.,"Complaint, and Salemenes' sister seeks not"
916,SCENE II.,Reluctant love even from Assyria's lord!                           220
917,SCENE II.,Nor would she deign to accept divided passion
918,SCENE II.,With foreign strumpets and Ionian slaves.
919,SCENE II.,The Queen is silent.
920,SCENE II.,
921,SCENE II.,_Sar._               And why not her brother?
922,SCENE II.,
923,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ I only echo thee the voice of empires,"
924,SCENE II.,Which he who long neglects not long will govern.
925,SCENE II.,
926,SCENE II.,_Sar._ The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur
927,SCENE II.,"Because I have not shed their blood, nor led them"
928,SCENE II.,"To dry into the desert's dust by myriads,"
929,SCENE II.,Or whiten with their bones the banks of Ganges;
930,SCENE II.,"Nor decimated them with savage laws,                               230"
931,SCENE II.,"Nor sweated them to build up Pyramids,"
932,SCENE II.,Or Babylonian walls.
933,SCENE II.,
934,SCENE II.,_Sal._               Yet these are trophies
935,SCENE II.,More worthy of a people and their prince
936,SCENE II.,"Than songs, and lutes, and feasts, and concubines,"
937,SCENE II.,"And lavished treasures, and contemnéd virtues."
938,SCENE II.,
939,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Or for my trophies I have founded cities:
940,SCENE II.,"There's Tarsus and Anchialus, both built"
941,SCENE II.,"In one day--what could that blood-loving beldame,"
942,SCENE II.,"My martial grandam, chaste Semiramis,"
943,SCENE II.,"Do more, except destroy them?"
944,SCENE II.,
945,SCENE II.,_Sal._                        'Tis most true;                      240
946,SCENE II.,"I own thy merit in those founded cities,"
947,SCENE II.,"Built for a whim, recorded with a verse"
948,SCENE II.,Which shames both them and thee to coming ages.
949,SCENE II.,
950,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Shame me! By Baal, the cities, though well built,"
951,SCENE II.,Are not more goodly than the verse! Say what
952,SCENE II.,"Thou wilt 'gainst me, my mode of life or rule,"
953,SCENE II.,But nothing 'gainst the truth of that brief record.
954,SCENE II.,"Why, those few lines contain the history"
955,SCENE II.,"Of all things human: hear--""Sardanapalus,"
956,SCENE II.,"The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,                                250"
957,SCENE II.,In one day built Anchialus and Tarsus.
958,SCENE II.,"Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth a fillip.""[10]"
959,SCENE II.,
960,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ A worthy moral, and a wise inscription,"
961,SCENE II.,For a king to put up before his subjects!
962,SCENE II.,
963,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Oh, thou wouldst have me doubtless set up edicts--"
964,SCENE II.,"""Obey the king--contribute to his treasure--"
965,SCENE II.,Recruit his phalanx--spill your blood at bidding--
966,SCENE II.,"Fall down and worship, or get up and toil."""
967,SCENE II.,"Or thus--""Sardanapalus on this spot"
968,SCENE II.,Slew fifty thousand of his enemies.                                260
969,SCENE II.,"These are their sepulchres, and this his trophy."""
970,SCENE II.,I leave such things to conquerors; enough
971,SCENE II.,"For me, if I can make my subjects feel"
972,SCENE II.,"The weight of human misery less, and glide"
973,SCENE II.,Ungroaning to the tomb: I take no license
974,SCENE II.,Which I deny to them. We all are men.
975,SCENE II.,
976,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Thy Sires have been revered as Gods--
977,SCENE II.,
978,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                        In dust
979,SCENE II.,"And death, where they are neither Gods nor men."
980,SCENE II.,Talk not of such to me! the worms are Gods;[11]
981,SCENE II.,"At least they banqueted upon your Gods,                            270"
982,SCENE II.,And died for lack of farther nutriment.
983,SCENE II.,Those Gods were merely men; look to their issue--
984,SCENE II.,"I feel a thousand mortal things about me,"
985,SCENE II.,"But nothing godlike,--unless it may be"
986,SCENE II.,"The thing which you condemn, a disposition"
987,SCENE II.,"To love and to be merciful, to pardon"
988,SCENE II.,"The follies of my species, and (that's human)"
989,SCENE II.,To be indulgent to my own.
990,SCENE II.,
991,SCENE II.,_Sal._                    Alas!
992,SCENE II.,The doom of Nineveh is sealed.--Woe--woe
993,SCENE II.,To the unrivalled city!
994,SCENE II.,
995,SCENE II.,_Sar._                  What dost dread?                           280
996,SCENE II.,
997,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Thou art guarded by thy foes: in a few hours
998,SCENE II.,"The tempest may break out which overwhelms thee,"
999,SCENE II.,And thine and mine; and in another day
1000,SCENE II.,What _is_ shall be the past of Belus' race.
1001,SCENE II.,
1002,SCENE II.,_Sar._ What must we dread?
1003,SCENE II.,
1004,SCENE II.,"_Sal._                    Ambitious treachery,"
1005,SCENE II.,Which has environed thee with snares; but yet
1006,SCENE II.,There is resource: empower me with thy signet
1007,SCENE II.,"To quell the machinations, and I lay"
1008,SCENE II.,The heads of thy chief foes before thy feet.
1009,SCENE II.,
1010,SCENE II.,_Sar._ The heads--how many?
1011,SCENE II.,
1012,SCENE II.,_Sal._                     Must I stay to number             290
1013,SCENE II.,When even thine own's in peril? Let me go;
1014,SCENE II.,Give me thy signet--trust me with the rest.
1015,SCENE II.,
1016,SCENE II.,_Sar._ I will trust no man with unlimited lives.
1017,SCENE II.,"When we take those from others, we nor know"
1018,SCENE II.,"What we have taken, nor the thing we give."
1019,SCENE II.,
1020,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Wouldst thou not take their lives who seek for thine?
1021,SCENE II.,
1022,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ That's a hard question--But I answer, Yes."
1023,SCENE II.,Cannot the thing be done without? Who are they
1024,SCENE II.,Whom thou suspectest?--Let them be arrested.
1025,SCENE II.,
1026,SCENE II.,_Sal._ I would thou wouldst not ask me; the next moment            300
1027,SCENE II.,Will send my answer through thy babbling troop
1028,SCENE II.,"Of paramours, and thence fly o'er the palace,"
1029,SCENE II.,"Even to the city, and so baffle all.--"
1030,SCENE II.,Trust me.
1031,SCENE II.,
1032,SCENE II.,_Sar._      Thou knowest I have done so ever;
1033,SCENE II.,Take thou the signet.                             [_Gives the signet_.
1034,SCENE II.,
1035,SCENE II.,_Sal._                I have one more request.
1036,SCENE II.,
1037,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Name it.
1038,SCENE II.,
1039,SCENE II.,_Sal._           That thou this night forbear the banquet
1040,SCENE II.,In the pavilion over the Euphrates.
1041,SCENE II.,
1042,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Forbear the banquet! Not for all the plotters
1043,SCENE II.,"That ever shook a kingdom! Let them come,"
1044,SCENE II.,And do their worst: I shall not blench for them;                   310
1045,SCENE II.,Nor rise the sooner; nor forbear the goblet;
1046,SCENE II.,Nor crown me with a single rose the less;
1047,SCENE II.,Nor lose one joyous hour.--I fear them not.
1048,SCENE II.,
1049,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ But thou wouldst arm thee, wouldst thou not, if needful?"
1050,SCENE II.,
1051,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Perhaps. I have the goodliest armour, and"
1052,SCENE II.,"A sword of such a temper, and a bow,"
1053,SCENE II.,"And javelin, which might furnish Nimrod forth:"
1054,SCENE II.,"A little heavy, but yet not unwieldy."
1055,SCENE II.,"And now I think on't, 'tis long since I've used them,"
1056,SCENE II.,"Even in the chase. Hast ever seen them, brother?                   320"
1057,SCENE II.,
1058,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Is this a time for such fantastic trifling?--
1059,SCENE II.,"If need be, wilt thou wear them?"
1060,SCENE II.,
1061,SCENE II.,_Sar._                           Will I not?
1062,SCENE II.,"Oh! if it must be so, and these rash slaves"
1063,SCENE II.,"Will not be ruled with less, I'll use the sword"
1064,SCENE II.,Till they shall wish it turned into a distaff.
1065,SCENE II.,
1066,SCENE II.,_Sal._ They say thy Sceptre's turned to that already.
1067,SCENE II.,
1068,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ That's false! but let them say so: the old Greeks,"
1069,SCENE II.,"Of whom our captives often sing, related"
1070,SCENE II.,"The same of their chief hero, Hercules,"
1071,SCENE II.,Because he loved a Lydian queen: thou seest                        330
1072,SCENE II.,The populace of all the nations seize
1073,SCENE II.,Each calumny they can to sink their sovereigns.
1074,SCENE II.,
1075,SCENE II.,_Sal._ They did not speak thus of thy fathers.
1076,SCENE II.,
1077,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                         No;
1078,SCENE II.,They dared not. They were kept to toil and combat;
1079,SCENE II.,And never changed their chains but for their armour:
1080,SCENE II.,"Now they have peace and pastime, and the license"
1081,SCENE II.,To revel and to rail; it irks me not.
1082,SCENE II.,I would not give the smile of one fair girl
1083,SCENE II.,For all the popular breath[12] that e'er divided
1084,SCENE II.,A name from nothing. What are the rank tongues[13]                 340
1085,SCENE II.,"Of this vile herd, grown insolent with feeding,"
1086,SCENE II.,"That I should prize their noisy praise, or dread"
1087,SCENE II.,Their noisome clamour?
1088,SCENE II.,
1089,SCENE II.,_Sal._                 You have said they are men;
1090,SCENE II.,As such their hearts are something.
1091,SCENE II.,
1092,SCENE II.,_Sar._                              So my dogs' are;
1093,SCENE II.,"And better, as more faithful:--but, proceed;"
1094,SCENE II.,"Thou hast my signet:--since they are tumultuous,"
1095,SCENE II.,"Let them be tempered, yet not roughly, till"
1096,SCENE II.,"Necessity enforce it. I hate all pain,"
1097,SCENE II.,"Given or received; we have enough within us,"
1098,SCENE II.,"The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch,                        350"
1099,SCENE II.,Not to add to each other's natural burthen
1100,SCENE II.,"Of mortal misery, but rather lessen,"
1101,SCENE II.,"By mild reciprocal alleviation,"
1102,SCENE II.,The fatal penalties imposed on life:
1103,SCENE II.,"But this they know not, or they will not know."
1104,SCENE II.,"I have, by Baal! done all I could to soothe them:"
1105,SCENE II.,"I made no wars, I added no new imposts,"
1106,SCENE II.,"I interfered not with their civic lives,"
1107,SCENE II.,"I let them pass their days as best might suit them,"
1108,SCENE II.,Passing my own as suited me.
1109,SCENE II.,
1110,SCENE II.,_Sal._                       Thou stopp'st                         360
1111,SCENE II.,Short of the duties of a king; and therefore
1112,SCENE II.,They say thou art unfit to be a monarch.
1113,SCENE II.,
1114,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ They lie.--Unhappily, I am unfit"
1115,SCENE II.,To be aught save a monarch; else for me
1116,SCENE II.,The meanest Mede might be the king instead.
1117,SCENE II.,
1118,SCENE II.,"_Sal._ There is one Mede, at least, who seeks to be so."
1119,SCENE II.,
1120,SCENE II.,_Sar._ What mean'st thou!--'tis thy secret; thou desirest
1121,SCENE II.,"Few questions, and I'm not of curious nature."
1122,SCENE II.,"Take the fit steps; and, since necessity"
1123,SCENE II.,"Requires, I sanction and support thee. Ne'er                       370"
1124,SCENE II.,Was man who more desired to rule in peace
1125,SCENE II.,"The peaceful only: if they rouse me, better"
1126,SCENE II.,"They had conjured up stern Nimrod from his ashes,"
1127,SCENE II.,"""The Mighty Hunter!"" I will turn these realms"
1128,SCENE II.,"To one wide desert chase of brutes, who _were_,"
1129,SCENE II.,"But _would_ no more, by their own choice, be human."
1130,SCENE II.,"_What_ they have found me, they belie; _that which_"
1131,SCENE II.,They yet may find me--shall defy their wish
1132,SCENE II.,To speak it worse; and let them thank themselves.
1133,SCENE II.,
1134,SCENE II.,_Sal._ Then thou at last canst feel?
1135,SCENE II.,
1136,SCENE II.,_Sar._                              Feel! who feels not            380
1137,SCENE II.,Ingratitude?[14]
1138,SCENE II.,
1139,SCENE II.,_Sal._      I will not pause to answer
1140,SCENE II.,"With words, but deeds. Keep thou awake that energy"
1141,SCENE II.,"Which sleeps at times, but is not dead within thee,"
1142,SCENE II.,"And thou may'st yet be glorious in thy reign,"
1143,SCENE II.,As powerful in thy realm. Farewell!                 [_Exit_ SALEMENES.
1144,SCENE II.,
1145,SCENE II.,_Sar._ (_solus_).                 Farewell!
1146,SCENE II.,"He's gone; and on his finger bears my signet,"
1147,SCENE II.,Which is to him a sceptre. He is stern
1148,SCENE II.,As I am heedless; and the slaves deserve
1149,SCENE II.,"To feel a master. What may be the danger,"
1150,SCENE II.,"I know not: he hath found it, let him quell it.                    390"
1151,SCENE II.,Must I consume my life--this little life--
1152,SCENE II.,In guarding against all may make it less?
1153,SCENE II.,It is not worth so much! It were to die
1154,SCENE II.,"Before my hour, to live in dread of death,"
1155,SCENE II.,"Tracing revolt; suspecting all about me,"
1156,SCENE II.,"Because they are near; and all who are remote,"
1157,SCENE II.,Because they are far. But if it should be so--
1158,SCENE II.,"If they should sweep me off from Earth and Empire,"
1159,SCENE II.,"Why, what is Earth or Empire of the Earth?"
1160,SCENE II.,"I have loved, and lived, and multiplied my image;                  400"
1161,SCENE II.,To die is no less natural than those
1162,SCENE II.,Acts of this clay! 'Tis true I have not shed
1163,SCENE II.,"Blood as I might have done, in oceans, till"
1164,SCENE II.,My name became the synonyme of Death--
1165,SCENE II.,A terror and a trophy. But for this
1166,SCENE II.,I feel no penitence; my life is love:
1167,SCENE II.,"If I must shed blood, it shall be by force."
1168,SCENE II.,"Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein"
1169,SCENE II.,"Hath flowed for me, nor hath the smallest coin"
1170,SCENE II.,Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavished                     410
1171,SCENE II.,On objects which could cost her sons a tear:
1172,SCENE II.,"If then they hate me, 'tis because I hate not:"
1173,SCENE II.,"If they rebel, 'tis because I oppress not."
1174,SCENE II.,"Oh, men! ye must be ruled with scythes, not sceptres,"
1175,SCENE II.,"And mowed down like the grass, else all we reap"
1176,SCENE II.,"Is rank abundance, and a rotten harvest"
1177,SCENE II.,"Of discontents infecting the fair soil,"
1178,SCENE II.,Making a desert of fertility.--
1179,SCENE II.,"I'll think no more.--Within there, ho!"
1180,SCENE II.,
1181,SCENE II.,_Enter an_ ATTENDANT.
1182,SCENE II.,
1183,SCENE II.,"_Sar._                                Slave, tell"
1184,SCENE II.,The Ionian Myrrha we would crave her presence.                     420
1185,SCENE II.,
1186,SCENE II.,"_Attend._ King, she is here."
1187,SCENE II.,
1188,SCENE II.,MYRRHA _enters_.
1189,SCENE II.,
1190,SCENE II.,_Sar._ (_apart to Attendant_). Away!
1191,SCENE II.,
1192,SCENE II.,(_Addressing_ MYRRHA.)              Beautiful being!
1193,SCENE II.,Thou dost almost anticipate my heart;
1194,SCENE II.,"It throbbed for thee, and here thou comest: let me"
1195,SCENE II.,"Deem that some unknown influence, some sweet oracle,"
1196,SCENE II.,"Communicates between us, though unseen,"
1197,SCENE II.,"In absence, and attracts us to each other."
1198,SCENE II.,
1199,SCENE II.,_Myr._ There doth.
1200,SCENE II.,
1201,SCENE II.,"_Sar._             I know there doth, but not its name:"
1202,SCENE II.,What is it?
1203,SCENE II.,
1204,SCENE II.,"_Myr._       In my native land a God,"
1205,SCENE II.,"And in my heart a feeling like a God's,"
1206,SCENE II.,Exalted; yet I own 'tis only mortal;                               430
1207,SCENE II.,"For what I feel is humble, and yet happy--"
1208,SCENE II.,"That is, it would be happy; but----                  [MYRRHA _pauses_."
1209,SCENE II.,
1210,SCENE II.,_Sar._                              There comes
1211,SCENE II.,For ever something between us and what
1212,SCENE II.,We deem our happiness: let me remove
1213,SCENE II.,The barrier which that hesitating accent
1214,SCENE II.,"Proclaims to thine, and mine is sealed."
1215,SCENE II.,
1216,SCENE II.,_Myr._                                  My Lord!--
1217,SCENE II.,
1218,SCENE II.,_Sar._ My Lord--my King--Sire--Sovereign; thus it is--
1219,SCENE II.,"For ever thus, addressed with awe. I ne'er"
1220,SCENE II.,"Can see a smile, unless in some broad banquet's"
1221,SCENE II.,"Intoxicating glare, when the buffoons                              440"
1222,SCENE II.,"Have gorged themselves up to equality,"
1223,SCENE II.,Or I have quaffed me down to their abasement.
1224,SCENE II.,"Myrrha, I can hear all these things, these names,"
1225,SCENE II.,"Lord--King--Sire--Monarch--nay, time was I prized them;"
1226,SCENE II.,"That is, I suffered them--from slaves and nobles;"
1227,SCENE II.,"But when they falter from the lips I love,"
1228,SCENE II.,"The lips which have been pressed to mine, a chill"
1229,SCENE II.,"Comes o'er my heart, a cold sense of the falsehood"
1230,SCENE II.,"Of this my station, which represses feeling"
1231,SCENE II.,"In those for whom I have felt most, and makes me                   450"
1232,SCENE II.,"Wish that I could lay down the dull tiara,"
1233,SCENE II.,And share a cottage on the Caucasus
1234,SCENE II.,With thee--and wear no crowns but those of flowers.
1235,SCENE II.,
1236,SCENE II.,_Myr._ Would that we could!
1237,SCENE II.,
1238,SCENE II.,_Sar._                     And dost _thou_ feel this?--Why?
1239,SCENE II.,
1240,SCENE II.,_Myr._ Then thou wouldst know what thou canst never know.
1241,SCENE II.,
1242,SCENE II.,_Sar._ And that is----
1243,SCENE II.,
1244,SCENE II.,_Myr._                  The true value of a heart;
1245,SCENE II.,"At least, a woman's."
1246,SCENE II.,
1247,SCENE II.,_Sar._               I have proved a thousand--A
1248,SCENE II.,"thousand, and a thousand."
1249,SCENE II.,
1250,SCENE II.,_Myr._                   Hearts?
1251,SCENE II.,
1252,SCENE II.,_Sar._                          I think so.
1253,SCENE II.,
1254,SCENE II.,_Myr._ Not one! the time may come thou may'st.
1255,SCENE II.,
1256,SCENE II.,_Sar._                                          It will.
1257,SCENE II.,"Hear, Myrrha; Salemenes has declared--                             460"
1258,SCENE II.,"Or why or how he hath divined it, Belus,"
1259,SCENE II.,"Who founded our great realm, knows more than I--"
1260,SCENE II.,But Salemenes hath declared my throne
1261,SCENE II.,In peril.
1262,SCENE II.,
1263,SCENE II.,_Myr._    He did well.
1264,SCENE II.,
1265,SCENE II.,_Sar._                And say'st _thou_ so?
1266,SCENE II.,"Thou whom he spurned so harshly, and now dared[g]"
1267,SCENE II.,"Drive from our presence with his savage jeers,"
1268,SCENE II.,And made thee weep and blush?
1269,SCENE II.,
1270,SCENE II.,_Myr._                        I should do both
1271,SCENE II.,"More frequently, and he did well to call me"
1272,SCENE II.,Back to my duty. But thou spakest of peril
1273,SCENE II.,Peril to thee----
1274,SCENE II.,
1275,SCENE II.,"_Sar._            Aye, from dark plots and snares                  470"
1276,SCENE II.,From Medes--and discontented troops and nations.
1277,SCENE II.,I know not what--a labyrinth of things--
1278,SCENE II.,A maze of muttered threats and mysteries:
1279,SCENE II.,Thou know'st the man--it is his usual custom.
1280,SCENE II.,"But he is honest. Come, we'll think no more on't--"
1281,SCENE II.,But of the midnight festival.
1282,SCENE II.,
1283,SCENE II.,_Myr._                       'Tis time
1284,SCENE II.,To think of aught save festivals. Thou hast not
1285,SCENE II.,Spurned his sage cautions?
1286,SCENE II.,
1287,SCENE II.,_Sar._                     What?--and dost thou fear?
1288,SCENE II.,
1289,SCENE II.,"_Myr._ Fear!--I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death?"
1290,SCENE II.,"A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom?                  480"
1291,SCENE II.,
1292,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Then wherefore dost thou turn so pale?
1293,SCENE II.,
1294,SCENE II.,_Myr._                                         I love.
1295,SCENE II.,
1296,SCENE II.,_Sar._ And do not I? I love thee far--far more
1297,SCENE II.,"Than either the brief life or the wide realm,"
1298,SCENE II.,"Which, it may be, are menaced;--yet I blench not."
1299,SCENE II.,
1300,SCENE II.,_Myr._ That means thou lovest nor thyself nor me;
1301,SCENE II.,"For he who loves another loves himself,"
1302,SCENE II.,Even for that other's sake. This is too rash:
1303,SCENE II.,Kingdoms and lives are not to be so lost.
1304,SCENE II.,
1305,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Lost!--why, who is the aspiring chief who dared"
1306,SCENE II.,Assume to win them?
1307,SCENE II.,
1308,SCENE II.,_Myr._             Who is he should dread                          490
1309,SCENE II.,To try so much? When he who is their ruler
1310,SCENE II.,Forgets himself--will they remember him?
1311,SCENE II.,
1312,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Myrrha!
1313,SCENE II.,
1314,SCENE II.,_Myr._        Frown not upon me: you have smiled
1315,SCENE II.,Too often on me not to make those frowns
1316,SCENE II.,Bitterer to bear than any punishment
1317,SCENE II.,"Which they may augur.--King, I am your subject!"
1318,SCENE II.,"Master, I am your slave! Man, I have loved you!--"
1319,SCENE II.,"Loved you, I know not by what fatal weakness,"
1320,SCENE II.,"Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs--"
1321,SCENE II.,"A slave, and hating fetters--an Ionian,                            500"
1322,SCENE II.,"And, therefore, when I love a stranger, more"
1323,SCENE II.,Degraded by that passion than by chains!
1324,SCENE II.,Still I have loved you. If that love were strong
1325,SCENE II.,"Enough to overcome all former nature,"
1326,SCENE II.,Shall it not claim the privilege to save you?
1327,SCENE II.,
1328,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ _Save_ me, my beauty! Thou art very fair,"
1329,SCENE II.,And what I seek of thee is love--not safety.
1330,SCENE II.,
1331,SCENE II.,_Myr._ And without love where dwells security?
1332,SCENE II.,
1333,SCENE II.,_Sar._ I speak of woman's love.
1334,SCENE II.,
1335,SCENE II.,_Myr._                         The very first
1336,SCENE II.,"Of human life must spring from woman's breast,                     510"
1337,SCENE II.,"Your first small words are taught you from her lips,"
1338,SCENE II.,"Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs"
1339,SCENE II.,"Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,"
1340,SCENE II.,When men have shrunk from the ignoble care
1341,SCENE II.,Of watching the last hour of him who led them.
1342,SCENE II.,
1343,SCENE II.,_Sar._ My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music:
1344,SCENE II.,The very chorus of the tragic song
1345,SCENE II.,I have heard thee talk of as the favourite pastime
1346,SCENE II.,"Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not--calm thee."
1347,SCENE II.,
1348,SCENE II.,"_Myr._ I weep not.--But I pray thee, do not speak                  520"
1349,SCENE II.,About my fathers or their land.
1350,SCENE II.,
1351,SCENE II.,_Sar._                          Yet oft
1352,SCENE II.,Thou speakest of them.
1353,SCENE II.,
1354,SCENE II.,_Myr._                 True--true: constant thought
1355,SCENE II.,Will overflow in words unconsciously;
1356,SCENE II.,"But when another speaks of Greeks, it wounds me."
1357,SCENE II.,
1358,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Well, then, how wouldst thou _save_ me, as thou saidst?"
1359,SCENE II.,
1360,SCENE II.,"_Myr._ By teaching thee to save thyself, and not"
1361,SCENE II.,"Thyself alone, but these vast realms, from all"
1362,SCENE II.,The rage of the worst war--the war of brethren.
1363,SCENE II.,
1364,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Why, child, I loathe all war, and warriors;"
1365,SCENE II.,I live in peace and pleasure: what can man                         530
1366,SCENE II.,Do more?
1367,SCENE II.,
1368,SCENE II.,"_Myr._       Alas! my Lord, with common men"
1369,SCENE II.,There needs too oft the show of war to keep
1370,SCENE II.,"The substance of sweet peace; and, for a king,"
1371,SCENE II.,'Tis sometimes better to be feared than loved.
1372,SCENE II.,
1373,SCENE II.,_Sar._ And I have never sought but for the last.
1374,SCENE II.,
1375,SCENE II.,_Myr._ And now art neither.
1376,SCENE II.,
1377,SCENE II.,"_Sar._                      Dost _thou_ say so, Myrrha?"
1378,SCENE II.,
1379,SCENE II.,"_Myr._ I speak of civic popular love, _self_-love,"
1380,SCENE II.,"Which means that men are kept in awe and law,"
1381,SCENE II.,"Yet not oppressed--at least they must not think so,"
1382,SCENE II.,"Or, if they think so, deem it necessary,                           540"
1383,SCENE II.,"To ward off worse oppression, their own passions."
1384,SCENE II.,"A King of feasts, and flowers, and wine, and revel,"
1385,SCENE II.,"And love, and mirth, was never King of Glory."
1386,SCENE II.,
1387,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Glory! what's that?
1388,SCENE II.,
1389,SCENE II.,_Myr._                     Ask of the Gods thy fathers.
1390,SCENE II.,
1391,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ They cannot answer; when the priests speak for them,"
1392,SCENE II.,'Tis for some small addition to the temple.
1393,SCENE II.,
1394,SCENE II.,_Myr._ Look to the annals of thine Empire's founders.
1395,SCENE II.,
1396,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ They are so blotted o'er with blood, I cannot."
1397,SCENE II.,But what wouldst have? the Empire _has been_ founded.
1398,SCENE II.,I cannot go on multiplying empires.                                550
1399,SCENE II.,
1400,SCENE II.,_Myr._ Preserve thine own.
1401,SCENE II.,
1402,SCENE II.,"_Sar._                     At least, I will enjoy it."
1403,SCENE II.,"Come, Myrrha, let us go on to the Euphrates:"
1404,SCENE II.,"The hour invites, the galley is prepared,"
1405,SCENE II.,"And the pavilion, decked for our return,"
1406,SCENE II.,"In fit adornment for the evening banquet,"
1407,SCENE II.,"Shall blaze with beauty and with light, until"
1408,SCENE II.,It seems unto the stars which are above us
1409,SCENE II.,Itself an opposite star; and we will sit
1410,SCENE II.,Crowned with fresh flowers like----
1411,SCENE II.,
1412,SCENE II.,_Myr._                             Victims.
1413,SCENE II.,
1414,SCENE II.,"_Sar._                                     No, like sovereigns,"
1415,SCENE II.,"The Shepherd Kings of patriarchal times,                           560"
1416,SCENE II.,"Who knew no brighter gems than summer wreaths,[h]"
1417,SCENE II.,And none but tearless triumphs. Let us on.
1418,SCENE II.,
1419,SCENE II.,_Enter_ PANIA.
1420,SCENE II.,
1421,SCENE II.,_Pan._ May the King live for ever!
1422,SCENE II.,
1423,SCENE II.,_Sar._                           Not an hour
1424,SCENE II.,Longer than he can love. How my soul hates
1425,SCENE II.,"This language, which makes life itself a lie,"
1426,SCENE II.,"Flattering dust with eternity.[i] Well, Pania!"
1427,SCENE II.,Be brief.
1428,SCENE II.,
1429,SCENE II.,_Pan._      I am charged by Salemenes to
1430,SCENE II.,"Reiterate his prayer unto the King,"
1431,SCENE II.,"That for this day, at least, he will not quit"
1432,SCENE II.,"The palace: when the General returns,                              570"
1433,SCENE II.,He will adduce such reasons as will warrant
1434,SCENE II.,"His daring, and perhaps obtain the pardon"
1435,SCENE II.,Of his presumption.
1436,SCENE II.,
1437,SCENE II.,_Sar._               What! am I then cooped?
1438,SCENE II.,Already captive? can I not even breathe
1439,SCENE II.,"The breath of heaven? Tell prince Salemenes,"
1440,SCENE II.,Were all Assyria raging round the walls
1441,SCENE II.,"In mutinous myriads, I would still go forth."
1442,SCENE II.,
1443,SCENE II.,"_Pan._ I must obey, and yet----"
1444,SCENE II.,
1445,SCENE II.,"_Myr._                        Oh, Monarch, listen.--"
1446,SCENE II.,How many a day and moon thou hast reclined
1447,SCENE II.,"Within these palace walls in silken dalliance,                     580"
1448,SCENE II.,And never shown thee to thy people's longing;
1449,SCENE II.,"Leaving thy subjects' eyes ungratified,"
1450,SCENE II.,"The satraps uncontrolled, the Gods unworshipped,"
1451,SCENE II.,"And all things in the anarchy of sloth,"
1452,SCENE II.,"Till all, save evil, slumbered through the realm!"
1453,SCENE II.,"And wilt thou not now tarry for a day,--"
1454,SCENE II.,A day which may redeem thee? Wilt thou not
1455,SCENE II.,"Yield to the few still faithful a few hours,"
1456,SCENE II.,"For them, for thee, for thy past fathers' race,"
1457,SCENE II.,And for thy sons' inheritance?
1458,SCENE II.,
1459,SCENE II.,_Pan._                         'Tis true!                          590
1460,SCENE II.,From the deep urgency with which the Prince
1461,SCENE II.,"Despatched me to your sacred presence, I"
1462,SCENE II.,Must dare to add my feeble voice to that
1463,SCENE II.,Which now has spoken.
1464,SCENE II.,
1465,SCENE II.,"_Sar._               No, it must not be."
1466,SCENE II.,
1467,SCENE II.,_Myr._ For the sake of thy realm!
1468,SCENE II.,
1469,SCENE II.,_Sar._                             Away!
1470,SCENE II.,
1471,SCENE II.,_Pan._                                 For that
1472,SCENE II.,"Of all thy faithful subjects, who will rally"
1473,SCENE II.,Round thee and thine.
1474,SCENE II.,
1475,SCENE II.,_Sar._               These are mere fantasies:
1476,SCENE II.,There is no peril:--'tis a sullen scheme
1477,SCENE II.,"Of Salemenes, to approve his zeal,"
1478,SCENE II.,And show himself more necessary to us.                             600
1479,SCENE II.,
1480,SCENE II.,_Myr._ By all that's good and glorious take this counsel.
1481,SCENE II.,
1482,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Business to-morrow.
1483,SCENE II.,
1484,SCENE II.,_Myr._                    Aye--or death to-night.
1485,SCENE II.,
1486,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ Why let it come then unexpectedly,"
1487,SCENE II.,"'Midst joy and gentleness, and mirth and love;"
1488,SCENE II.,So let me fall like the plucked rose!--far better
1489,SCENE II.,Thus than be withered.
1490,SCENE II.,
1491,SCENE II.,"_Myr._                 Then thou wilt not yield,"
1492,SCENE II.,Even for the sake of all that ever stirred
1493,SCENE II.,"A monarch into action, to forego"
1494,SCENE II.,A trifling revel.
1495,SCENE II.,
1496,SCENE II.,_Sar._            No.
1497,SCENE II.,
1498,SCENE II.,_Myr._               Then yield for _mine_;
1499,SCENE II.,For my sake!
1500,SCENE II.,
1501,SCENE II.,"_Sar._      Thine, my Myrrha!"
1502,SCENE II.,
1503,SCENE II.,_Myr._                      'Tis the first                         610
1504,SCENE II.,Boon which I ever asked Assyria's king.
1505,SCENE II.,
1506,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ That's true, and, wer't my kingdom, must be granted."
1507,SCENE II.,"Well, for thy sake, I yield me. Pania, hence!"
1508,SCENE II.,Thou hear'st me.
1509,SCENE II.,
1510,SCENE II.,_Pan._           And obey.                              [_Exit_ PANIA.
1511,SCENE II.,
1512,SCENE II.,_Sar._                     I marvel at thee.
1513,SCENE II.,"What is thy motive, Myrrha, thus to urge me?"
1514,SCENE II.,
1515,SCENE II.,_Myr._ Thy safety; and the certainty that nought
1516,SCENE II.,Could urge the Prince thy kinsman to require
1517,SCENE II.,"Thus much from thee, but some impending danger."
1518,SCENE II.,
1519,SCENE II.,"_Sar._ And if I do not dread it, why shouldst thou?"
1520,SCENE II.,
1521,SCENE II.,"_Myr._ Because _thou_ dost not fear, I fear for _thee_.            620"
1522,SCENE II.,
1523,SCENE II.,_Sar._ To-morrow thou wilt smile at these vain fancies.
1524,SCENE II.,
1525,SCENE II.,"_Myr._ If the worst come, I shall be where none weep,"
1526,SCENE II.,And that is better than the power to smile.
1527,SCENE II.,And thou?
1528,SCENE II.,
1529,SCENE II.,"_Sar._    I shall be King, as heretofore."
1530,SCENE II.,
1531,SCENE II.,_Myr._ Where?
1532,SCENE II.,
1533,SCENE II.,"_Sar._         With Baal, Nimrod, and Semiramis,"
1534,SCENE II.,"Sole in Assyria, or with them elsewhere."
1535,SCENE II.,Fate made me what I am--may make me nothing--
1536,SCENE II.,But either that or nothing must I be:
1537,SCENE II.,I will not live degraded.
1538,SCENE II.,
1539,SCENE II.,_Myr._                    Hadst thou felt
1540,SCENE II.,"Thus always, none would ever dare degrade thee.                    630"
1541,SCENE II.,
1542,SCENE II.,_Sar._ And who will do so now?
1543,SCENE II.,
1544,SCENE II.,_Myr._                        Dost thou suspect none?
1545,SCENE II.,
1546,SCENE II.,_Sar._ Suspect!--that's a spy's office. Oh! we lose
1547,SCENE II.,"Ten thousand precious moments in vain words,"
1548,SCENE II.,"And vainer fears. Within there!--ye slaves, deck"
1549,SCENE II.,The Hall of Nimrod for the evening revel;
1550,SCENE II.,"If I must make a prison of our palace,"
1551,SCENE II.,At least we'll wear our fetters jocundly;
1552,SCENE II.,"If the Euphrates be forbid us, and"
1553,SCENE II.,"The summer-dwelling on its beauteous border,"
1554,SCENE II.,Here we are still unmenaced. Ho! within there!                     640
1555,SCENE II.,[_Exit_ SARDANAPALUS.
1556,SCENE II.,
1557,SCENE II.,_Myr._ (_solus_).
1558,SCENE II.,Why do I love this man? My country's daughters
1559,SCENE II.,Love none but heroes. But I have no country!
1560,SCENE II.,The slave hath lost all save her bonds. I love him;
1561,SCENE II.,And that's the heaviest link of the long chain--
1562,SCENE II.,To love whom we esteem not. Be it so:
1563,SCENE II.,"The hour is coming when he'll need all love,"
1564,SCENE II.,And find none. To fall from him now were baser
1565,SCENE II.,Than to have stabbed him on his throne when highest
1566,SCENE II.,Would have been noble in my country's creed:
1567,SCENE II.,"I was not made for either. Could I save him,                       650"
1568,SCENE II.,"I should not love _him_ better, but myself;"
1569,SCENE II.,"And I have need of the last, for I have fallen"
1570,SCENE II.,"In my own thoughts, by loving this soft stranger:"
1571,SCENE II.,"And yet, methinks, I love him more, perceiving"
1572,SCENE II.,"That he is hated of his own barbarians,"
1573,SCENE II.,The natural foes of all the blood of Greece.
1574,SCENE II.,Could I but wake a single thought like those
1575,SCENE II.,Which even the Phrygians felt when battling long
1576,SCENE II.,"'Twixt Ilion and the sea, within his heart,"
1577,SCENE II.,"He would tread down the barbarous crowds, and triumph.             660"
1578,SCENE II.,"He loves me, and I love him; the slave loves"
1579,SCENE II.,"Her master, and would free him from his vices."
1580,SCENE II.,"If not, I have a means of freedom still,"
1581,SCENE II.,"And if I cannot teach him how to reign,"
1582,SCENE II.,May show him how alone a King can leave
1583,SCENE II.,His throne. I must not lose him from my sight.                [_Exit_.

1659,ACT II.,Is issued for the feast in the pavilion.
1660,ACT II.,The first cup which he drains will be the last
1661,ACT II.,Quaffed by the line of Nimrod.
1662,ACT II.,
1663,ACT II.,_Bel._                         'Twas a brave one.
1664,ACT II.,
1665,ACT II.,_Arb._ And is a weak one--'tis worn out--we'll mend it.
1666,ACT II.,
1667,ACT II.,_Bel._ Art sure of that?
1668,ACT II.,
1669,ACT II.,_Arb._                    Its founder was a hunter--
1670,ACT II.,I am a soldier--what is there to fear?
1671,ACT II.,
1672,ACT II.,_Bel._ The soldier.
1673,ACT II.,
1674,ACT II.,"_Arb._              And the priest, it may be: but"
1675,ACT II.,"If you thought thus, or think, why not retain"
1676,ACT II.,Your king of concubines? why stir me up?
1677,ACT II.,Why spur me to this enterprise? your own                            60
1678,ACT II.,No less than mine?
1679,ACT II.,
1680,ACT II.,_Bel._            Look to the sky!
1681,ACT II.,
1682,ACT II.,_Arb._                            I look.
1683,ACT II.,
1684,ACT II.,_Bel._ What seest thou?
1685,ACT II.,
1686,ACT II.,"_Arb._                  A fair summer's twilight, and"
1687,ACT II.,The gathering of the stars.
1688,ACT II.,
1689,ACT II.,"_Bel._                      And midst them, mark"
1690,ACT II.,"Yon earliest, and the brightest, which so quivers,"
1691,ACT II.,As it would quit its place in the blue ether.
1692,ACT II.,
1693,ACT II.,_Arb._ Well?
1694,ACT II.,
1695,ACT II.,_Bel._      'Tis thy natal ruler--thy birth planet.
1696,ACT II.,
1697,ACT II.,_Arb._ (_touching his scabbard_).
1698,ACT II.,"My star is in this scabbard: when it shines,"
1699,ACT II.,It shall out-dazzle comets. Let us think
1700,ACT II.,Of what is to be done to justify
1701,ACT II.,"Thy planets and their portents. When we conquer,                    70"
1702,ACT II.,"They shall have temples--aye, and priests--and thou"
1703,ACT II.,Shalt be the pontiff of--what Gods thou wilt;
1704,ACT II.,"For I observe that they are ever just,"
1705,ACT II.,And own the bravest for the most devout.
1706,ACT II.,
1707,ACT II.,"_Bel._ Aye, and the most devout for brave--thou hast not"
1708,ACT II.,Seen me turn back from battle.
1709,ACT II.,
1710,ACT II.,_Arb._                         No; I own thee
1711,ACT II.,"As firm in fight as Babylonia's captain,"
1712,ACT II.,"As skilful in Chaldea's worship: now,"
1713,ACT II.,"Will it but please thee to forget the priest,"
1714,ACT II.,And be the warrior?
1715,ACT II.,
1716,ACT II.,_Bel._              Why not both?
1717,ACT II.,
1718,ACT II.,_Arb._                           The better;                        80
1719,ACT II.,"And yet it almost shames me, we shall have"
1720,ACT II.,So little to effect. This woman's warfare
1721,ACT II.,Degrades the very conqueror. To have plucked
1722,ACT II.,"A bold and bloody despot from his throne,"
1723,ACT II.,"And grappled with him, clashing steel with steel,"
1724,ACT II.,That were heroic or to win or fall;
1725,ACT II.,"But to upraise my sword against this silkworm,[15]"
1726,ACT II.,"And hear him whine, it may be----"
1727,ACT II.,
1728,ACT II.,_Bel._                           Do not deem it:
1729,ACT II.,He has that in him which may make you strife yet;
1730,ACT II.,"And were he all you think, his guards are hardy,                    90"
1731,ACT II.,"And headed by the cool, stern Salemenes."
1732,ACT II.,
1733,ACT II.,_Arb._ They'll not resist.
1734,ACT II.,
1735,ACT II.,_Bel._                     Why not? they are soldiers.
1736,ACT II.,
1737,ACT II.,"_Arb._                                                True,"
1738,ACT II.,And therefore need a soldier to command them.
1739,ACT II.,
1740,ACT II.,_Bel._ That Salemenes is.
1741,ACT II.,
1742,ACT II.,_Arb._                    But not their King.
1743,ACT II.,"Besides, he hates the effeminate thing that governs,"
1744,ACT II.,"For the Queen's sake, his sister. Mark you not"
1745,ACT II.,He keeps aloof from all the revels?
1746,ACT II.,
1747,ACT II.,_Bel._                              But
1748,ACT II.,Not from the council--there he is ever constant.
1749,ACT II.,
1750,ACT II.,_Arb._ And ever thwarted: what would you have more
1751,ACT II.,"To make a rebel out of? A fool reigning,                           100"
1752,ACT II.,"His blood dishonoured, and himself disdained:"
1753,ACT II.,"Why, it is _his_ revenge we work for."
1754,ACT II.,
1755,ACT II.,_Bel._                                Could
1756,ACT II.,He but be brought to think so: this I doubt of.
1757,ACT II.,
1758,ACT II.,"_Arb._ What, if we sound him?"
1759,ACT II.,
1760,ACT II.,_Bel._                       Yes--if the time served.
1761,ACT II.,
1762,ACT II.,_Enter_ BALEA.
1763,ACT II.,
1764,ACT II.,_Bal._ Satraps! The king commands your presence at
1765,ACT II.,The feast to-night.
1766,ACT II.,
1767,ACT II.,_Bel._              To hear is to obey.
1768,ACT II.,In the pavilion?
1769,ACT II.,
1770,ACT II.,_Bal._           No; here in the palace.
1771,ACT II.,
1772,ACT II.,_Arb._ How! in the palace? it was not thus ordered.
1773,ACT II.,
1774,ACT II.,_Bal._ It is so ordered now.
1775,ACT II.,
1776,ACT II.,_Arb._                        And why?
1777,ACT II.,
1778,ACT II.,_Bal._                                I know not.
1779,ACT II.,May I retire?
1780,ACT II.,
1781,ACT II.,_Arb._       Stay.
1782,ACT II.,
1783,ACT II.,_Bel._ (_to Arb. aside_). Hush! let him go his way.                110
1784,ACT II.,"(_Alternately to Bal._) Yes, Balea, thank the Monarch, kiss the hem"
1785,ACT II.,"Of his imperial robe, and say, his slaves"
1786,ACT II.,Will take the crumbs he deigns to scatter from
1787,ACT II.,His royal table at the hour--was't midnight?
1788,ACT II.,
1789,ACT II.,"_Bal._ It was: the place, the hall of Nimrod. Lords,"
1790,ACT II.,"I humble me before you, and depart.                     [_Exit_ BALEA."
1791,ACT II.,
1792,ACT II.,_Arb._ I like not this same sudden change of place;
1793,ACT II.,There is some mystery: wherefore should he change it?
1794,ACT II.,
1795,ACT II.,_Bel._ Doth he not change a thousand times a day?
1796,ACT II.,Sloth is of all things the most fanciful--                         120
1797,ACT II.,And moves more parasangs in its intents
1798,ACT II.,"Than generals in their marches, when they seek"
1799,ACT II.,To leave their foe at fault.--Why dost thou muse?
1800,ACT II.,
1801,ACT II.,"_Arb._ He loved that gay pavilion,--it was ever"
1802,ACT II.,His summer dotage.
1803,ACT II.,
1804,ACT II.,_Bel._             And he loved his Queen--
1805,ACT II.,And thrice a thousand harlotry besides--
1806,ACT II.,"And he has loved all things by turns, except"
1807,ACT II.,Wisdom and Glory.
1808,ACT II.,
1809,ACT II.,_Arb._            Still--I like it not.
1810,ACT II.,"If he has changed--why, so must we: the attack"
1811,ACT II.,"Were easy in the isolated bower,                                   130"
1812,ACT II.,Beset with drowsy guards and drunken courtiers;
1813,ACT II.,But in the hall of Nimrod----
1814,ACT II.,
1815,ACT II.,_Bel._                         Is it so?
1816,ACT II.,Methought the haughty soldier feared to mount
1817,ACT II.,A throne too easily--does it disappoint thee
1818,ACT II.,To find there is a slipperier step or two
1819,ACT II.,Than what was counted on?
1820,ACT II.,
1821,ACT II.,"_Arb._                    When the hour comes,"
1822,ACT II.,Thou shall perceive how far I fear or no.
1823,ACT II.,Thou hast seen my life at stake--and gaily played for:
1824,ACT II.,But here is more upon the die--a kingdom.
1825,ACT II.,
1826,ACT II.,_Bel._ I have foretold already--thou wilt win it:                  140
1827,ACT II.,"Then on, and prosper."
1828,ACT II.,
1829,ACT II.,"_Arb._                Now were I a soothsayer,"
1830,ACT II.,I would have boded so much to myself.
1831,ACT II.,But be the stars obeyed--I cannot quarrel
1832,ACT II.,"With them, nor their interpreter. Who's here?"
1833,ACT II.,
1834,ACT II.,_Enter_ SALEMENES.
1835,ACT II.,
1836,ACT II.,_Sal._ Satraps!
1837,ACT II.,
1838,ACT II.,_Bel._            My Prince!
1839,ACT II.,
1840,ACT II.,"_Sal._                     Well met--I sought ye both,"
1841,ACT II.,But elsewhere than the palace.
1842,ACT II.,
1843,ACT II.,_Arb._                         Wherefore so?
1844,ACT II.,
1845,ACT II.,_Sal._ 'Tis not the hour.
1846,ACT II.,
1847,ACT II.,_Arb._                    The hour!--what hour?
1848,ACT II.,
1849,ACT II.,_Sal._                                         Of midnight.
1850,ACT II.,
1851,ACT II.,"_Bel._ Midnight, my Lord!"
1852,ACT II.,
1853,ACT II.,"_Sal._                     What, are you not invited?"
1854,ACT II.,
1855,ACT II.,_Bel._ Oh! yes--we had forgotten.
1856,ACT II.,
1857,ACT II.,_Sal._                             Is it usual
1858,ACT II.,Thus to forget a Sovereign's invitation?
1859,ACT II.,
1860,ACT II.,_Arb._ Why--we but now received it.                                150
1861,ACT II.,
1862,ACT II.,_Sal._                              Then why here?
1863,ACT II.,
1864,ACT II.,_Arb._ On duty.
1865,ACT II.,
1866,ACT II.,_Sal._           On what duty?
1867,ACT II.,
1868,ACT II.,_Bel._                         On the state's.
1869,ACT II.,We have the privilege to approach the presence;
1870,ACT II.,But found the Monarch absent.[k]
1871,ACT II.,
1872,ACT II.,_Sal._                        And I too
1873,ACT II.,Am upon duty.
1874,ACT II.,
1875,ACT II.,_Arb._       May we crave its purport?
1876,ACT II.,
1877,ACT II.,_Sal._ To arrest two traitors. Guards! Within there!
1878,ACT II.,
1879,ACT II.,_Enter Guards_.
1880,ACT II.,
1881,ACT II.,"_Sal._ (_continuing_).                               Satraps,"
1882,ACT II.,Your swords.
1883,ACT II.,
1884,ACT II.,"_Bel._ (_delivering his_). My lord, behold my scimitar."
1885,ACT II.,
1886,ACT II.,_Arb._ (_drawing his sword_). Take mine.
1887,ACT II.,
1888,ACT II.,_Sal._ (_advancing_).                     I will.
1889,ACT II.,
1890,ACT II.,_Arb._                             But in your heart the blade--
1891,ACT II.,The hilt quits not this hand.[l]
1892,ACT II.,
1893,ACT II.,_Sal._ (_drawing_).         How! dost thou brave me?
1894,ACT II.,"Tis well--this saves a trial, and false mercy.                     160"
1895,ACT II.,"Soldiers, hew down the rebel!"
1896,ACT II.,
1897,ACT II.,_Arb._                        Soldiers! Aye--
1898,ACT II.,"_Alone, you_ dare not."
1899,ACT II.,
1900,ACT II.,_Sal._                Alone! foolish slave--
1901,ACT II.,What is there in thee that a Prince should shrink from
1902,ACT II.,"Of open force? We dread thy treason, not"
1903,ACT II.,Thy strength: thy tooth is nought without its venom--
1904,ACT II.,"The serpent's, not the lion's. Cut him down."
1905,ACT II.,
1906,ACT II.,_Bel._ (_interposing_). Arbaces! Are you mad? Have I not rendered
1907,ACT II.,_My_ sword? Then trust like me our Sovereign's justice.
1908,ACT II.,
1909,ACT II.,"_Arb._   No--I will sooner trust the stars thou prat'st of,"
1910,ACT II.,"And this slight arm, and die a king at least                       170"
1911,ACT II.,Of my own breath and body--so far that
1912,ACT II.,None else shall chain them.
1913,ACT II.,
1914,ACT II.,_Sal._ (_to the Guards_).     You hear _him_ and _me_.
1915,ACT II.,"Take him not,--kill."
1916,ACT II.,
1917,ACT II.,"[_The Guards attack_ ARBACES, _who defends himself"
1918,ACT II.,valiantly and dexterously till they waver_.
1919,ACT II.,
1920,ACT II.,_Sal._                   Is it even so; and must
1921,ACT II.,I do the hangman's office? Recreants! see
1922,ACT II.,How you should fell a traitor.
1923,ACT II.,[SALEMENES _attacks_ ARBACES.
1924,ACT II.,
1925,ACT II.,_Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and Train_.
1926,ACT II.,
1927,ACT II.,_Sar._                         Hold your hands--
1928,ACT II.,"Upon your lives, I say. What, deaf or drunken?"
1929,ACT II.,"My sword! O fool, I wear no sword: here, fellow,"
1930,ACT II.,Give me thy weapon.                                     [_To a Guard_.

1932,ACT II.,"[SARDANAPALUS _snatches a sword from one of the soldiers,"
1933,ACT II.,and rushes between the combatants--they separate_.

1936,ACT II.,"What hinders me from cleaving you in twain,"
1937,ACT II.,Audacious brawlers?
1938,ACT II.,
1939,ACT II.,"_Bel._              Sire, your justice."
1940,ACT II.,
1941,ACT II.,_Sal._                                 Or--                        180
1942,ACT II.,Your weakness.
1943,ACT II.,
1944,ACT II.,_Sar._ (_raising the sword_). How?
1945,ACT II.,
1946,ACT II.,_Sal._             Strike! so the blow's repeated
1947,ACT II.,"Upon yon traitor--whom you spare a moment,"
1948,ACT II.,"I trust, for torture--I'm content."
1949,ACT II.,
1950,ACT II.,_Sar._                             What--him!
1951,ACT II.,Who dares assail Arbaces?
1952,ACT II.,
1953,ACT II.,_Sal._                    I!
1954,ACT II.,
1955,ACT II.,_Sar._                      Indeed!
1956,ACT II.,"Prince, you forget yourself. Upon what warrant?"
1957,ACT II.,
1958,ACT II.,_Sal._ (_showing the signet_). Thine.
1959,ACT II.,
1960,ACT II.,_Arb._ (_confused_).               The King's!
1961,ACT II.,
1962,ACT II.,_Sal._ Yes! and let the King confirm it.
1963,ACT II.,
1964,ACT II.,_Sar._ I parted not from this for such a purpose.
1965,ACT II.,
1966,ACT II.,_Sal._ You parted with it for your safety--I
1967,ACT II.,Employed it for the best. Pronounce in person.
1968,ACT II.,Here I am but your slave--a moment past                            190
1969,ACT II.,I was your representative.
1970,ACT II.,
1971,ACT II.,_Sar._                     Then sheathe
1972,ACT II.,Your swords.
1973,ACT II.,[ARBACES _and_ SALEMENES _return their swords to the scabbards_.

1977,ACT II.,
1978,ACT II.,"_Sar._ A heavy one; the hilt, too, hurts my hand."
1979,ACT II.,"(_To a Guard_.) Here, fellow, take thy weapon back. Well, sirs,"
1980,ACT II.,What doth this mean?
1981,ACT II.,
1982,ACT II.,_Bel._               The Prince must answer that.
1983,ACT II.,
1984,ACT II.,"_Sal._ Truth upon my part, treason upon theirs."
1985,ACT II.,
1986,ACT II.,_Sar._ Treason--Arbaces! treachery and Beleses!
1987,ACT II.,That were an union I will not believe.
1988,ACT II.,
1989,ACT II.,_Bel._ Where is the proof?
1990,ACT II.,
1991,ACT II.,"_Sal._                          I'll answer that, if once          200"
1992,ACT II.,The king demands your fellow-traitor's sword.
1993,ACT II.,
1994,ACT II.,_Arb._ (_to Sal._). A sword which hath been drawn as oft as thine
1995,ACT II.,Against his foes.
1996,ACT II.,
1997,ACT II.,"_Sal._          And now against his brother,"
1998,ACT II.,And in an hour or so against himself.
1999,ACT II.,
2000,ACT II.,_Sar._ That is not possible: he dared not; no--
2001,ACT II.,No--I'll not hear of such things. These vain bickerings
2002,ACT II.,"Are spawned in courts by base intrigues, and baser"
2003,ACT II.,"Hirelings, who live by lies on good men's lives."

2014,ACT II.,"Of all who discipline our nations----No,"
2015,ACT II.,"I'll not insult him thus, to bid him render"
2016,ACT II.,The scimitar to me he never yielded
2017,ACT II.,"Unto our enemies. Chief, keep your weapon."
2018,ACT II.,
2019,ACT II.,_Sal._ (_delivering back the signet_).
2020,ACT II.,"Monarch, take back your signet."
2021,ACT II.,
2022,ACT II.,"_Sar._                          No, retain it;"
2023,ACT II.,But use it with more moderation.
2024,ACT II.,
2025,ACT II.,"_Sal._                          Sire,                             200"
2026,ACT II.,"I used it for your honour, and restore it"
2027,ACT II.,Because I cannot keep it with my own.
2028,ACT II.,Bestow it on Arbaces.
2029,ACT II.,
2030,ACT II.,_Sar._                So I should:
2031,ACT II.,He never asked it.
2032,ACT II.,
2033,ACT II.,"_Sal._             Doubt not, he will have it,"
2034,ACT II.,Without that hollow semblance of respect.
2035,ACT II.,
2036,ACT II.,_Bel._ I know not what hath prejudiced the Prince
2037,ACT II.,"So strongly 'gainst two subjects, than whom none"
2038,ACT II.,Have been more zealous for Assyria's weal.
2039,ACT II.,
2040,ACT II.,"_Sal._ Peace, factious priest, and faithless soldier! thou"
2041,ACT II.,Unit'st in thy own person the worst vices                          230
2042,ACT II.,Of the most dangerous orders of mankind.
2043,ACT II.,Keep thy smooth words and juggling homilies
2044,ACT II.,For those who know thee not. Thy fellow's sin
2045,ACT II.,"Is, at the least, a bold one, and not tempered"
2046,ACT II.,By the tricks taught thee in Chaldea.
2047,ACT II.,
2048,ACT II.,"_Bel._                                Hear him,"
2049,ACT II.,My liege--the son of Belus! he blasphemes
2050,ACT II.,"The worship of the land, which bows the knee"
2051,ACT II.,Before your fathers.
2052,ACT II.,
2053,ACT II.,_Sar._               Oh! for that I pray you
2054,ACT II.,Let him have absolution. I dispense with
2055,ACT II.,The worship of dead men; feeling that I                            240
2056,ACT II.,"Am mortal, and believing that the race"
2057,ACT II.,From whence I sprung are--what I see them--ashes.
2058,ACT II.,
2059,ACT II.,"_Bel._ King! Do not deem so: they are with the stars,"
2060,ACT II.,And----
2061,ACT II.,
2062,ACT II.,"_Sar._   You shall join them ere they will rise,"
2063,ACT II.,"If you preach farther--Why, _this_ is rank treason."
2064,ACT II.,
2065,ACT II.,_Sal._ My lord!
2066,ACT II.,
2067,ACT II.,_Sar._          To school me in the worship of
2068,ACT II.,Assyria's idols! Let him be released--
2069,ACT II.,Give him his sword.
2070,ACT II.,
2071,ACT II.,"_Sal._              My Lord, and King, and Brother,"
2072,ACT II.,I pray ye pause.
2073,ACT II.,
2074,ACT II.,"_Sar._           Yes, and be sermonised,"
2075,ACT II.,"And dinned, and deafened with dead men and Baal,                   250"
2076,ACT II.,And all Chaldea's starry mysteries.
2077,ACT II.,
2078,ACT II.,_Bel._ Monarch! respect them.
2079,ACT II.,
2080,ACT II.,_Sar._                       Oh! for that--I love them;
2081,ACT II.,"I love to watch them in the deep blue vault,"
2082,ACT II.,And to compare them with my Myrrha's eyes;
2083,ACT II.,I love to see their rays redoubled in
2084,ACT II.,"The tremulous silver of Euphrates' wave,"
2085,ACT II.,As the light breeze of midnight crisps the broad
2086,ACT II.,"And rolling water, sighing through the sedges"
2087,ACT II.,Which fringe his banks: but whether they may be
2088,ACT II.,"Gods, as some say, or the abodes of Gods,                          260"
2089,ACT II.,"As others hold, or simply lamps of night,"
2090,ACT II.,Worlds--or the lights of Worlds--I know nor care not.
2091,ACT II.,There's something sweet in my uncertainty
2092,ACT II.,I would not change for your Chaldean lore;
2093,ACT II.,"Besides, I know of these all clay can know"
2094,ACT II.,"Of aught above it, or below it--nothing."
2095,ACT II.,I see their brilliancy and feel their beauty[m]--
2096,ACT II.,When they shine on my grave I shall know neither.
2097,ACT II.,
2098,ACT II.,"_Bel._ For _neither_, Sire, say _better_."
2099,ACT II.,
2100,ACT II.,"_Sar._                                    I will wait,"
2101,ACT II.,"If it so please you, Pontiff, for that knowledge.                  270"
2102,ACT II.,"In the mean time receive your sword, and know"
2103,ACT II.,That I prefer your service militant
2104,ACT II.,Unto your ministry--not loving either.
2105,ACT II.,
2106,ACT II.,"_Sal._ (_aside_). His lusts have made him mad. Then must I save him,"
2107,ACT II.,Spite of himself.
2108,ACT II.,
2109,ACT II.,"_Sar._            Please you to hear me, Satraps!"
2110,ACT II.,"And chiefly thou, my priest, because I doubt thee"
2111,ACT II.,More than the soldier; and would doubt thee all
2112,ACT II.,Wert thou not half a warrior: let us part
2113,ACT II.,In peace--I'll not say pardon--which must be
2114,ACT II.,"Earned by the guilty; this I'll not pronounce ye,                  280"
2115,ACT II.,Although upon this breath of mine depends
2116,ACT II.,"Your own; and, deadlier for ye, on my fears."
2117,ACT II.,"But fear not--for that I am soft, not fearful--"
2118,ACT II.,"And so live on. Were I the thing some think me,"
2119,ACT II.,Your heads would now be dripping the last drops
2120,ACT II.,Of their attainted gore from the high gates
2121,ACT II.,"Of this our palace, into the dry dust,"
2122,ACT II.,Their only portion of the coveted kingdom
2123,ACT II.,They would be crowned to reign o'er--let that pass.
2124,ACT II.,"As I have said, I will not _deem_ ye guilty,                       290"
2125,ACT II.,Nor _doom_ ye guiltless. Albeit better men
2126,ACT II.,Than ye or I stand ready to arraign you;
2127,ACT II.,"And should I leave your fate to sterner judges,"
2128,ACT II.,"And proofs of all kinds, I might sacrifice"
2129,ACT II.,"Two men, who, whatsoe'er they now are, were"
2130,ACT II.,"Once honest. Ye are free, sirs."
2131,ACT II.,
2132,ACT II.,"_Arb._                          Sire, this clemency----"
2133,ACT II.,
2134,ACT II.,_Bel._ (_interrupting him_).
2135,ACT II.,"Is worthy of yourself; and, although innocent,"
2136,ACT II.,We thank----
2137,ACT II.,
2138,ACT II.,_Sar._      Priest! keep your thanksgivings for Belus;
2139,ACT II.,His offspring needs none.
2140,ACT II.,
2141,ACT II.,_Bel._                    But being innocent----
2142,ACT II.,
2143,ACT II.,"_Sar._ Be silent.--Guilt is loud. If ye are loyal,                 300"
2144,ACT II.,"Ye are injured men, and should be sad, not grateful."
2145,ACT II.,
2146,ACT II.,"_Bel._ So we should be, were justice always done"
2147,ACT II.,By earthly power omnipotent; but Innocence
2148,ACT II.,Must oft receive her right as a mere favour.
2149,ACT II.,
2150,ACT II.,"_Sar._ That's a good sentence for a homily,"
2151,ACT II.,Though not for this occasion. Prithee keep it
2152,ACT II.,To plead thy Sovereign's cause before his people.
2153,ACT II.,
2154,ACT II.,_Bel._ I trust there is no cause.
2155,ACT II.,
2156,ACT II.,"_Sar._                             No _cause_, perhaps;"
2157,ACT II.,But many causers:--if ye meet with such
2158,ACT II.,In the exercise of your inquisitive function                       310
2159,ACT II.,"On earth, or should you read of it in heaven"
2160,ACT II.,"In some mysterious twinkle of the stars,"
2161,ACT II.,"Which are your chronicles, I pray you note,"
2162,ACT II.,That there are worse things betwixt earth and heaven
2163,ACT II.,Than him who ruleth many and slays none;
2164,ACT II.,"And, hating not himself, yet loves his fellows"
2165,ACT II.,Enough to spare even those who would not spare him
2166,ACT II.,Were they once masters--but that's doubtful. Satraps!
2167,ACT II.,Your swords and persons are at liberty
2168,ACT II.,To use them as ye will--but from this hour                         320
2169,ACT II.,I have no call for either. Salemenes!
2170,ACT II.,Follow me.
2171,ACT II.,
2172,ACT II.,"[_Exeunt_ SARDANAPALUS, SALEMENES, _and the Train, etc.,"
2173,ACT II.,leaving_ ARBACES _and_ BELESES.
2174,ACT II.,
2175,ACT II.,_Arb._        Beleses!
2176,ACT II.,
2177,ACT II.,"_Bel._                 Now, what think you?"
2178,ACT II.,
2179,ACT II.,_Arb._ That we are lost.
2180,ACT II.,
2181,ACT II.,_Bel._                 That we have won the kingdom.
2182,ACT II.,
2183,ACT II.,_Arb._ What? thus suspected--with the sword slung o'er us
2184,ACT II.,"But by a single hair, and that still wavering,"
2185,ACT II.,To be blown down by his imperious breath
2186,ACT II.,"Which spared us--why, I know not."
2187,ACT II.,
2188,ACT II.,_Bel._                            Seek not why;
2189,ACT II.,But let us profit by the interval.[n]
2190,ACT II.,The hour is still our own--our power the same--
2191,ACT II.,The night the same we destined. He hath changed                    330
2192,ACT II.,Nothing except our ignorance of all
2193,ACT II.,Suspicion into such a certainty
2194,ACT II.,As must make madness of delay.
2195,ACT II.,
2196,ACT II.,_Arb._                        And yet--
2197,ACT II.,
2198,ACT II.,"_Bel._ What, doubting still?"
2199,ACT II.,
2200,ACT II.,"_Arb._                       He spared our lives, nay, more,"
2201,ACT II.,Saved them from Salemenes.
2202,ACT II.,
2203,ACT II.,_Bel._                     And how long
2204,ACT II.,Will he so spare? till the first drunken minute.
2205,ACT II.,
2206,ACT II.,"_Arb._ Or sober, rather. Yet he did it nobly;"
2207,ACT II.,Gave royally what we had forfeited
2208,ACT II.,Basely----
2209,ACT II.,
2210,ACT II.,_Bel._    Say bravely.
2211,ACT II.,
2212,ACT II.,"_Arb._                 Somewhat of both, perhaps--"
2213,ACT II.,"But it has touched me, and, whate'er betide,                       340"
2214,ACT II.,I will no further on.
2215,ACT II.,
2216,ACT II.,_Bel._                And lose the world!
2217,ACT II.,
2218,ACT II.,_Arb._ Lose any thing except my own esteem.
2219,ACT II.,
2220,ACT II.,_Bel._ I blush that we should owe our lives to such
2221,ACT II.,A king of distaffs!
2222,ACT II.,
2223,ACT II.,_Arb._              But no less we owe them;
2224,ACT II.,And I should blush far more to take the grantor's![16]
2225,ACT II.,
2226,ACT II.,_Bel._ Thou may'st endure whate'er thou wilt--the stars
2227,ACT II.,Have written otherwise.
2228,ACT II.,
2229,ACT II.,"_Arb._                  Though they came down,"
2230,ACT II.,"And marshalled me the way in all their brightness,"
2231,ACT II.,I would not follow.
2232,ACT II.,
2233,ACT II.,_Bel._             This is weakness--worse
2234,ACT II.,"Than a scared beldam's dreaming of the dead,                       350"
2235,ACT II.,And waking in the dark.--Go to--go to.
2236,ACT II.,
2237,ACT II.,"_Arb._ Methought he looked like Nimrod as he spoke,"
2238,ACT II.,Even as the proud imperial statue stands
2239,ACT II.,"Looking the monarch of the kings around it,"
2240,ACT II.,"And sways, while they but ornament, the temple."
2241,ACT II.,
2242,ACT II.,"_Bel._ I told you that you had too much despised him,"
2243,ACT II.,And that there was some royalty within him--What
2244,ACT II.,then? he is the nobler foe.
2245,ACT II.,
2246,ACT II.,_Arb._                     But we
2247,ACT II.,The meaner.--Would he had not spared us!
2248,ACT II.,
2249,ACT II.,_Bel._                                   So--
2250,ACT II.,Wouldst thou be sacrificed thus readily?                           360
2251,ACT II.,
2252,ACT II.,_Arb._ No--but it had been better to have died
2253,ACT II.,Than live ungrateful.
2254,ACT II.,
2255,ACT II.,"_Bel._                Oh, the souls of some men!"
2256,ACT II.,"Thou wouldst digest what some call treason, and"
2257,ACT II.,"Fools treachery--and, behold, upon the sudden,"
2258,ACT II.,"Because for something or for nothing, this"
2259,ACT II.,"Rash reveller steps, ostentatiously,"
2260,ACT II.,"'Twixt thee and Salemenes, thou art turned"
2261,ACT II.,Into--what shall I say?--Sardanapalus!
2262,ACT II.,I know no name more ignominious.
2263,ACT II.,
2264,ACT II.,_Arb._                           But
2265,ACT II.,"An hour ago, who dared to term me such                             370"
2266,ACT II.,"Had held his life but lightly--as it is,"
2267,ACT II.,"I must forgive you, even as he forgave us--"
2268,ACT II.,Semiramis herself would not have done it.
2269,ACT II.,
2270,ACT II.,"_Bel._ No--the Queen liked no sharers of the kingdom,"
2271,ACT II.,Not even a husband.[17]
2272,ACT II.,
2273,ACT II.,_Arb._              I must serve him truly----
2274,ACT II.,
2275,ACT II.,_Bel._ And humbly?
2276,ACT II.,
2277,ACT II.,"_Arb._               No, sir, proudly--being honest."
2278,ACT II.,I shall be nearer thrones than you to heaven;
2279,ACT II.,"And if not quite so haughty, yet more lofty."
2280,ACT II.,"You may do your own deeming--you have codes,"
2281,ACT II.,"And mysteries, and corollaries of                                  380"
2282,ACT II.,"Right and wrong, which I lack for my direction,"
2283,ACT II.,And must pursue but what a plain heart teaches.
2284,ACT II.,And now you know me.
2285,ACT II.,
2286,ACT II.,_Bel._               Have you finished?
2287,ACT II.,
2288,ACT II.,_Arb._                                 Yes--
2289,ACT II.,With you.
2290,ACT II.,
2291,ACT II.,"_Bel._    And would, perhaps, betray as well"
2292,ACT II.,As quit me?
2293,ACT II.,
2294,ACT II.,"_Arb._       That's a sacerdotal thought,"
2295,ACT II.,And not a soldier's.
2296,ACT II.,
2297,ACT II.,_Bel._               Be it what you will--
2298,ACT II.,"Truce with these wranglings, and but hear me."
2299,ACT II.,
2300,ACT II.,_Arb._                                        No--
2301,ACT II.,There is more peril in your subtle spirit
2302,ACT II.,Than in a phalanx.
2303,ACT II.,
2304,ACT II.,_Bel._            If it must be so--
2305,ACT II.,I'll on alone.
2306,ACT II.,
2307,ACT II.,_Arb._         Alone!
2308,ACT II.,
2309,ACT II.,_Bel._               Thrones hold but one.                         390
2310,ACT II.,
2311,ACT II.,_Arb._ But this is filled.
2312,ACT II.,
2313,ACT II.,_Bel._                      With worse than vacancy--
2314,ACT II.,"A despised monarch. Look to it, Arbaces:"
2315,ACT II.,"I have still aided, cherished, loved, and urged you;"
2316,ACT II.,"Was willing even to serve you, in the hope"
2317,ACT II.,To serve and save Assyria. Heaven itself
2318,ACT II.,"Seemed to consent, and all events were friendly,"
2319,ACT II.,"Even to the last, till that your spirit shrunk"
2320,ACT II.,"Into a shallow softness; but now, rather"
2321,ACT II.,"Than see my country languish, I will be"
2322,ACT II.,Her saviour or the victim of her tyrant--                          400
2323,ACT II.,Or one or both--for sometimes both are one;
2324,ACT II.,And if I win--Arbaces is my servant.
2325,ACT II.,
2326,ACT II.,_Arb._ _Your_ servant!
2327,ACT II.,
2328,ACT II.,"_Bel._                Why not? better than be slave,"
2329,ACT II.,The _pardoned_ slave of _she_ Sardanapalus!
2330,ACT II.,
2331,ACT II.,_Enter_ PANIA.
2332,ACT II.,
2333,ACT II.,"_Pan._ My Lords, I bear an order from the king."
2334,ACT II.,
2335,ACT II.,_Arb._ It is obeyed ere spoken.
2336,ACT II.,
2337,ACT II.,"_Bel._                          Notwithstanding,"
2338,ACT II.,Let's hear it.
2339,ACT II.,
2340,ACT II.,"_Pan._         Forthwith, on this very night,"
2341,ACT II.,Repair to your respective satrapies
2342,ACT II.,Of Babylon and Media.
2343,ACT II.,
2344,ACT II.,_Bel._                With our troops?
2345,ACT II.,
2346,ACT II.,_Pan._ My order is unto the Satraps and                            410
2347,ACT II.,Their household train.
2348,ACT II.,
2349,ACT II.,_Arb._                But----
2350,ACT II.,
2351,ACT II.,_Bel._                        It must be obeyed:
2352,ACT II.,"Say, we depart."
2353,ACT II.,
2354,ACT II.,_Pan._          My order is to see you
2355,ACT II.,"Depart, and not to bear your answer."
2356,ACT II.,
2357,ACT II.,_Bel._ (_aside_).                   Aye[o]!
2358,ACT II.,"Well, Sir--we will accompany you hence."
2359,ACT II.,
2360,ACT II.,_Pan._ I will retire to marshal forth the guard
2361,ACT II.,"Of honour which befits your rank, and wait"
2362,ACT II.,"Your leisure, so that it the hour exceeds not."
2363,ACT II.,[_Exit_ PANIA.
2364,ACT II.,
2365,ACT II.,_Bel._ Now then obey!
2366,ACT II.,
2367,ACT II.,_Arb._                Doubtless.
2368,ACT II.,
2369,ACT II.,"_Bel._                           Yes, to the gates"
2370,ACT II.,"That grate the palace, which is now our prison--"
2371,ACT II.,No further.
2372,ACT II.,
2373,ACT II.,_Arb._   Thou hast harped the truth indeed!                        420
2374,ACT II.,"The realm itself, in all its wide extension,"
2375,ACT II.,Yawns dungeons at each step for thee and me.
2376,ACT II.,
2377,ACT II.,_Bel._ Graves!
2378,ACT II.,
2379,ACT II.,"_Arb._         If I thought so, this good sword should dig"
2380,ACT II.,One more than mine.
2381,ACT II.,
2382,ACT II.,_Bel._              It shall have work enough.
2383,ACT II.,Let me hope better than thou augurest;
2384,ACT II.,"At present, let us hence as best we may."
2385,ACT II.,Thou dost agree with me in understanding
2386,ACT II.,This order as a sentence?
2387,ACT II.,
2388,ACT II.,"_Arb._                    Why, what other"
2389,ACT II.,Interpretation should it bear? it is
2390,ACT II.,The very policy of Orient monarchs--                               430
2391,ACT II.,Pardon and poison--favours and a sword--
2392,ACT II.,"A distant voyage, and an eternal sleep."
2393,ACT II.,How many Satraps in his father's time--
2394,ACT II.,"For he I own is, or at least _was_, bloodless--"
2395,ACT II.,
2396,ACT II.,_Bel._ But _will_ not--_can_ not be so now.
2397,ACT II.,
2398,ACT II.,_Arb._                                     I doubt it.
2399,ACT II.,How many Satraps have I seen set out
2400,ACT II.,"In his Sire's day for mighty Vice-royalties,"
2401,ACT II.,"Whose tombs are on their path! I know not how,"
2402,ACT II.,"But they all sickened by the way, it was"
2403,ACT II.,So long and heavy.
2404,ACT II.,
2405,ACT II.,_Bel._             Let us but regain                               440
2406,ACT II.,"The free air of the city, and we'll shorten"
2407,ACT II.,The journey.
2408,ACT II.,
2409,ACT II.,"_Arb._      'Twill be shortened at the gates,"
2410,ACT II.,It may be.
2411,ACT II.,
2412,ACT II.,_Bel._    No; they hardly will risk that.
2413,ACT II.,"They mean us to die privately, but not"
2414,ACT II.,"Within the palace or the city walls,"
2415,ACT II.,"Where we are known, and may have partisans:"
2416,ACT II.,"If they had meant to slay us here, we were"
2417,ACT II.,No longer with the living. Let us hence.
2418,ACT II.,
2419,ACT II.,_Arb._ If I but thought he did not mean my life--
2420,ACT II.,
2421,ACT II.,_Bel._ Fool! hence--what else should despotism alarmed             450
2422,ACT II.,"Mean? Let us but rejoin our troops, and march."
2423,ACT II.,
2424,ACT II.,_Arb._ Towards our provinces?
2425,ACT II.,
2426,ACT II.,_Bel._                        No; towards your kingdom.
2427,ACT II.,"There's time--there's heart, and hope, and power, and means--"
2428,ACT II.,Which their half measures leave us in full scope.--
2429,ACT II.,Away!
2430,ACT II.,
2431,ACT II.,_Arb._ And I even yet repenting must
2432,ACT II.,Relapse to guilt!
2433,ACT II.,
2434,ACT II.,"_Bel._            Self-defence is a virtue,"
2435,ACT II.,"Sole bulwark of all right. Away, I say!"
2436,ACT II.,"Let's leave this place, the air grows thick and choking,"
2437,ACT II.,And the walls have a scent of night-shade--hence!
2438,ACT II.,Let us not leave them time for further council.                    460
2439,ACT II.,Our quick departure proves our civic zeal;
2440,ACT II.,"Our quick departure hinders our good escort,"
2441,ACT II.,"The worthy Pania, from anticipating"
2442,ACT II.,The orders of some parasangs from hence:
2443,ACT II.,"Nay, there's no other choice, but----hence, I say[p]."
2444,ACT II.,"[_Exit with_ ARBACES, _who follows reluctantly_."
2445,ACT II.,
2446,ACT II.,_Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SALEMENES.
2447,ACT II.,
2448,ACT II.,"_Sar._ Well, all is remedied, and without bloodshed,"
2449,ACT II.,That worst of mockeries of a remedy;
2450,ACT II.,We are now secure by these men's exile.
2451,ACT II.,
2452,ACT II.,"_Sal._                                  Yes,"
2453,ACT II.,As he who treads on flowers is from the adder
2454,ACT II.,Twined round their roots.
2455,ACT II.,
2456,ACT II.,"_Sar._                    Why, what wouldst have me do?            470"
2457,ACT II.,
2458,ACT II.,_Sal._ Undo what you have done.
2459,ACT II.,
2460,ACT II.,_Sar._                           Revoke my pardon?
2461,ACT II.,
2462,ACT II.,_Sal._ Replace the crown now tottering on your temples.
2463,ACT II.,
2464,ACT II.,_Sar._ That were tyrannical.
2465,ACT II.,
2466,ACT II.,_Sal._                       But sure.
2467,ACT II.,
2468,ACT II.,_Sar._                                 We are so.
2469,ACT II.,What danger can they work upon the frontier?
2470,ACT II.,
2471,ACT II.,"_Sal._ They are not there yet--never should they be so,"
2472,ACT II.,Were I well listened to.
2473,ACT II.,
2474,ACT II.,"_Sar._                   Nay, I _have_ listened"
2475,ACT II.,Impartially to thee--why not to them?
2476,ACT II.,
2477,ACT II.,"_Sal._ You may know that hereafter; as it is,"
2478,ACT II.,I take my leave to order forth the guard.
2479,ACT II.,
2480,ACT II.,_Sar._ And you will join us at the banquet?
2481,ACT II.,
2482,ACT II.,"_Sal._                                      Sire,                  480"
2483,ACT II.,Dispense with me--I am no wassailer:
2484,ACT II.,Command me in all service save the Bacchant's.
2485,ACT II.,
2486,ACT II.,"_Sar._ Nay, but 'tis fit to revel now and then."
2487,ACT II.,
2488,ACT II.,_Sal._ And fit that some should watch for those who revel
2489,ACT II.,Too oft. Am I permitted to depart?
2490,ACT II.,
2491,ACT II.,"_Sar._ Yes----Stay a moment, my good Salemenes,"
2492,ACT II.,My brother--my best subject--better Prince
2493,ACT II.,"Than I am King. You should have been the monarch,"
2494,ACT II.,"And I--I know not what, and care not; but"
2495,ACT II.,Think not I am insensible to all                                   490
2496,ACT II.,"Thine honest wisdom, and thy rough yet kind,"
2497,ACT II.,Though oft-reproving sufferance of my follies.
2498,ACT II.,"If I have spared these men against thy counsel,"
2499,ACT II.,"That is, their lives--it is not that I doubt"
2500,ACT II.,"The advice was sound; but, let them live: we will not"
2501,ACT II.,Cavil about their lives--so let them mend them.
2502,ACT II.,"Their banishment will leave me still sound sleep,"
2503,ACT II.,Which their death had not left me.
2504,ACT II.,
2505,ACT II.,_Sal._                             Thus you run
2506,ACT II.,"The risk to sleep for ever, to save traitors--"
2507,ACT II.,A moment's pang now changed for years of crime.                    500
2508,ACT II.,Still let them be made quiet.
2509,ACT II.,
2510,ACT II.,_Sar._                        Tempt me not;
2511,ACT II.,My word is past.
2512,ACT II.,
2513,ACT II.,_Sal._           But it may be recalled.
2514,ACT II.,
2515,ACT II.,_Sar._ 'Tis royal.
2516,ACT II.,
2517,ACT II.,_Sal._              And should therefore be decisive.
2518,ACT II.,This half-indulgence of an exile serves
2519,ACT II.,"But to provoke--a pardon should be full,"
2520,ACT II.,Or it is none.
2521,ACT II.,
2522,ACT II.,_Sar._         And who persuaded me
2523,ACT II.,"After I had repealed them, or at least"
2524,ACT II.,"Only dismissed them from our presence, who"
2525,ACT II.,Urged me to send them to their satrapies?
2526,ACT II.,
2527,ACT II.,"_Sal._ True; that I had forgotten; that is, Sire,                  510"
2528,ACT II.,"If they e'er reached their Satrapies--why, then,"
2529,ACT II.,Reprove me more for my advice.
2530,ACT II.,
2531,ACT II.,_Sar._                        And if
2532,ACT II.,"They do not reach them--look to it!--in safety,"
2533,ACT II.,"In safety, mark me--and security--"
2534,ACT II.,Look to thine own.
2535,ACT II.,
2536,ACT II.,_Sal._             Permit me to depart;
2537,ACT II.,Their _safety_ shall be cared for.
2538,ACT II.,
2539,ACT II.,"_Sar._                            Get thee hence, then;"
2540,ACT II.,"And, prithee, think more gently of thy brother."
2541,ACT II.,
2542,ACT II.,"_Sal._ Sire, I shall ever duly serve my sovereign."
2543,ACT II.,[_Exit_ SALEMENES.
2544,ACT II.,
2545,ACT II.,_Sar._ (_solus_). That man is of a temper too severe;
2546,ACT II.,"Hard but as lofty as the rock, and free                            520"
2547,ACT II.,From all the taints of common earth--while I
2548,ACT II.,"Am softer clay, impregnated with flowers:"
2549,ACT II.,"But as our mould is, must the produce be."
2550,ACT II.,"If I have erred this time, 'tis on the side"
2551,ACT II.,"Where Error sits most lightly on that sense,"
2552,ACT II.,I know not what to call it; but it reckons
2553,ACT II.,"With me ofttimes for pain, and sometimes pleasure;"
2554,ACT II.,A spirit which seems placed about my heart
2555,ACT II.,"To count its throbs, not quicken them, and ask"
2556,ACT II.,"Questions which mortal never dared to ask me,                      530"
2557,ACT II.,"Nor Baal, though an oracular deity--[q]"
2558,ACT II.,Albeit his marble face majestical
2559,ACT II.,Frowns as the shadows of the evening dim
2560,ACT II.,"His brows to changed expression, till at times"
2561,ACT II.,I think the statue looks in act to speak.
2562,ACT II.,"Away with these vain thoughts, I will be joyous--"
2563,ACT II.,And here comes Joy's true herald.
2564,ACT II.,
2565,ACT II.,_Enter_ MYRRHA.
2566,ACT II.,
2567,ACT II.,_Myr._                           King! the sky
2568,ACT II.,"Is overcast, and musters muttering thunder,"
2569,ACT II.,"In clouds that seem approaching fast, and show"
2570,ACT II.,In forkéd flashes a commanding tempest.[r]                         540
2571,ACT II.,Will you then quit the palace?
2572,ACT II.,
2573,ACT II.,"_Sar._                        Tempest, say'st thou?"
2574,ACT II.,
2575,ACT II.,"_Myr._ Aye, my good lord."
2576,ACT II.,
2577,ACT II.,"_Sar._                    For my own part, I should be"
2578,ACT II.,"Not ill content to vary the smooth scene,"
2579,ACT II.,And watch the warring elements; but this
2580,ACT II.,Would little suit the silken garments and
2581,ACT II.,"Smooth faces of our festive friends. Say, Myrrha,"
2582,ACT II.,Art thou of those who dread the roar of clouds?
2583,ACT II.,
2584,ACT II.,_Myr._ In my own country we respect their voices
2585,ACT II.,As auguries of Jove.[s]
2586,ACT II.,
2587,ACT II.,"_Sar._              Jove!--aye, your Baal--"
2588,ACT II.,"Ours also has a property in thunder,                               550"
2589,ACT II.,And ever and anon some falling bolt
2590,ACT II.,"Proves his divinity,--and yet sometimes"
2591,ACT II.,Strikes his own altars.
2592,ACT II.,
2593,ACT II.,_Myr._                  That were a dread omen.
2594,ACT II.,
2595,ACT II.,"_Sar._ Yes--for the priests. Well, we will not go forth"
2596,ACT II.,"Beyond the palace walls to-night, but make"
2597,ACT II.,Our feast within.
2598,ACT II.,
2599,ACT II.,"_Myr._             Now, Jove be praised! that he"
2600,ACT II.,Hath heard the prayer thou wouldst not hear. The Gods
2601,ACT II.,"Are kinder to thee than thou to thyself,"
2602,ACT II.,"And flash this storm between thee and thy foes,"
2603,ACT II.,To shield thee from them.
2604,ACT II.,
2605,ACT II.,"_Sar._                   Child, if there be peril,                 560"
2606,ACT II.,Methinks it is the same within these walls
2607,ACT II.,As on the river's brink.
2608,ACT II.,
2609,ACT II.,_Myr._                   Not so; these walls
2610,ACT II.,"Are high and strong, and guarded. Treason has"
2611,ACT II.,"To penetrate through many a winding way,"
2612,ACT II.,And massy portal; but in the pavilion
2613,ACT II.,There is no bulwark.
2614,ACT II.,
2615,ACT II.,"_Sar._               No, nor in the palace,"
2616,ACT II.,"Nor in the fortress, nor upon the top"
2617,ACT II.,"Of cloud-fenced Caucasus, where the eagle sits"
2618,ACT II.,"Nested in pathless clefts, if treachery be:"
2619,ACT II.,"Even as the arrow finds the airy king,                             570"
2620,ACT II.,The steel will reach the earthly. But be calm;
2621,ACT II.,"The men, or innocent or guilty, are"
2622,ACT II.,"Banished, and far upon their way."
2623,ACT II.,
2624,ACT II.,"_Myr._                            They live, then?"
2625,ACT II.,
2626,ACT II.,_Sar._ So sanguinary? _Thou!_
2627,ACT II.,
2628,ACT II.,_Myr._                      I would not shrink
2629,ACT II.,From just infliction of due punishment
2630,ACT II.,"On those who seek your life: were't otherwise,"
2631,ACT II.,"I should not merit mine. Besides, you heard"
2632,ACT II.,The princely Salemenes.
2633,ACT II.,
2634,ACT II.,_Sar._                  This is strange;
2635,ACT II.,"The gentle and the austere are both against me,"
2636,ACT II.,And urge me to revenge.
2637,ACT II.,
2638,ACT II.,_Myr._                 'Tis a Greek virtue.                        580
2639,ACT II.,
2640,ACT II.,_Sar._ But not a kingly one--I'll none on't; or
2641,ACT II.,"If ever I indulge in't, it shall be"
2642,ACT II.,With kings--my equals.
2643,ACT II.,
2644,ACT II.,_Myr._                 These men sought to be so.
2645,ACT II.,
2646,ACT II.,"_Sar._ Myrrha, this is too feminine, and springs"
2647,ACT II.,From fear----
2648,ACT II.,
2649,ACT II.,_Myr._       For you.
2650,ACT II.,
2651,ACT II.,"_Sar._               No matter, still 'tis fear."
2652,ACT II.,"I have observed your sex, once roused to wrath,"
2653,ACT II.,Are timidly vindictive to a pitch
2654,ACT II.,"Of perseverance, which I would not copy."
2655,ACT II.,"I thought you were exempt from this, as from"
2656,ACT II.,The childish helplessness of Asian women[t].                       590
2657,ACT II.,
2658,ACT II.,"_Myr._ My Lord, I am no boaster of my love,"
2659,ACT II.,"Nor of my attributes; I have shared your splendour,"
2660,ACT II.,And will partake your fortunes. You may live
2661,ACT II.,To find one slave more true than subject myriads:
2662,ACT II.,But this the Gods avert! I am content
2663,ACT II.,"To be beloved on trust for what I feel,"
2664,ACT II.,"Rather than prove it to you in your griefs[u],"
2665,ACT II.,Which might not yield to any cares of mine.
2666,ACT II.,
2667,ACT II.,"_Sar._ Grief cannot come where perfect love exists,"
2668,ACT II.,"Except to heighten it, and vanish from                             600"
2669,ACT II.,That which it could not scare away. Let's in--
2670,ACT II.,"The hour approaches, and we must prepare"
2671,ACT II.,To meet the invited guests who grace our feast.
2672,ACT II.,[_Exeunt_.

2680,ACT III.,SCENE I.--_The Hall of the Palace illuminated_--SARDANAPALUS
2681,ACT III.,"_and his Guests at Table.--A storm without, and Thunder"
2682,ACT III.,occasionally heard during the Banquet_.
2683,ACT III.,
2684,ACT III.,_Sar._ Fill full! why this is as it should be: here
2685,ACT III.,"Is my true realm, amidst bright eyes and faces"
2686,ACT III.,Happy as fair! Here sorrow cannot reach.
2687,ACT III.,
2688,ACT III.,"_Zam._ Nor elsewhere--where the King is, pleasure sparkles."
2689,ACT III.,
2690,ACT III.,"_Sar._ Is not this better now than Nimrod's huntings,"
2691,ACT III.,Or my wild Grandam's chase in search of kingdoms
2692,ACT III.,She could not keep when conquered?
2693,ACT III.,
2694,ACT III.,_Alt._                            Mighty though
2695,ACT III.,"They were, as all thy royal line have been,"
2696,ACT III.,Yet none of those who went before have reached
2697,ACT III.,"The acmé of Sardanapalus, who                                       10"
2698,ACT III.,Has placed his joy in peace--the sole true glory.
2699,ACT III.,
2700,ACT III.,"_Sar._ And pleasure, good Altada, to which glory"
2701,ACT III.,Is but the path. What is it that we seek?
2702,ACT III.,"Enjoyment! We have cut the way short to it,"
2703,ACT III.,"And not gone tracking it through human ashes,"
2704,ACT III.,Making a grave with every footstep.
2705,ACT III.,
2706,ACT III.,_Zam._                              No;
2707,ACT III.,"All hearts are happy, and all voices bless"
2708,ACT III.,The King of peace--who holds a world in jubilee.
2709,ACT III.,
2710,ACT III.,_Sar._ Art sure of that? I have heard otherwise;
2711,ACT III.,Some say that there be traitors.
2712,ACT III.,
2713,ACT III.,_Zam._                           Traitors they                      20
2714,ACT III.,Who dare to say so!--'Tis impossible.
2715,ACT III.,What cause?
2716,ACT III.,
2717,ACT III.,"_Sar._      What cause? true,--fill the goblet up;"
2718,ACT III.,"We will not think of them: there are none such,"
2719,ACT III.,"Or if there be, they are gone."
2720,ACT III.,
2721,ACT III.,"_Alt._                         Guests, to my pledge!"
2722,ACT III.,"Down on your knees, and drink a measure to"
2723,ACT III.,"The safety of the King--the monarch, say I?"
2724,ACT III.,The God Sardanapalus!
2725,ACT III.,"[ZAMES _and the Guests kneel, and exclaim_--"
2726,ACT III.,Mightier than
2727,ACT III.,"His father Baal, the God Sardanapalus!"
2728,ACT III.,[_It thunders as they kneel; some start up in confusion_.
2729,ACT III.,
2730,ACT III.,"_Zam._ Why do you rise, my friends? in that strong peal"
2731,ACT III.,His father gods consented.
2732,ACT III.,
2733,ACT III.,"_Myr._                     Menaced, rather.                         30"
2734,ACT III.,"King, wilt thou bear this mad impiety?"
2735,ACT III.,
2736,ACT III.,"_Sar._ Impiety!--nay, if the sires who reigned"
2737,ACT III.,"Before me can be Gods, I'll not disgrace"
2738,ACT III.,"Their lineage. But arise, my pious friends;"
2739,ACT III.,Hoard your devotion for the Thunderer there:
2740,ACT III.,"I seek but to be loved, not worshipped."
2741,ACT III.,
2742,ACT III.,_Alt._                                 Both--
2743,ACT III.,Both you must ever be by all true subjects.
2744,ACT III.,
2745,ACT III.,_Sar._ Methinks the thunders still increase: it is
2746,ACT III.,An awful night.
2747,ACT III.,
2748,ACT III.,"_Myr._          Oh yes, for those who have"
2749,ACT III.,No palace to protect their worshippers.                             40
2750,ACT III.,
2751,ACT III.,"_Sar._ That's true, my Myrrha; and could I convert"
2752,ACT III.,"My realm to one wide shelter for the wretched,"
2753,ACT III.,I'd do it.
2754,ACT III.,
2755,ACT III.,"_Myr._   Thou'rt no God, then--not to be"
2756,ACT III.,"Able to work a will so good and general,"
2757,ACT III.,As thy wish would imply.
2758,ACT III.,
2759,ACT III.,"_Sar._                   And your Gods, then,"
2760,ACT III.,"Who can, and do not?"
2761,ACT III.,
2762,ACT III.,"_Myr._               Do not speak of that,"
2763,ACT III.,Lest we provoke them.
2764,ACT III.,
2765,ACT III.,"_Sar._                True--, they love not censure"
2766,ACT III.,"Better than mortals. Friends, a thought has struck me:"
2767,ACT III.,"Were there no temples, would there, think ye, be"
2768,ACT III.,"Air worshippers?[v] that is, when it is angry,                      50"
2769,ACT III.,And pelting as even now.
2770,ACT III.,
2771,ACT III.,_Myr._                 The Persian prays
2772,ACT III.,Upon his mountain.
2773,ACT III.,
2774,ACT III.,"_Sar._             Yes, when the Sun shines."
2775,ACT III.,
2776,ACT III.,_Myr._ And I would ask if this your palace were
2777,ACT III.,"Unroofed and desolate, how many flatterers"
2778,ACT III.,Would lick the dust in which the King lay low?
2779,ACT III.,
2780,ACT III.,_Alt._ The fair Ionian is too sarcastic
2781,ACT III.,Upon a nation whom she knows not well;
2782,ACT III.,"The Assyrians know no pleasure but their King's,"
2783,ACT III.,And homage is their pride.
2784,ACT III.,
2785,ACT III.,"_Sar._                     Nay, pardon, guests,"
2786,ACT III.,The fair Greek's readiness of speech.
2787,ACT III.,
2788,ACT III.,_Alt._                               _Pardon!_ sire:                60
2789,ACT III.,We honour her of all things next to thee.
2790,ACT III.,Hark! what was that?
2791,ACT III.,
2792,ACT III.,_Zam._               That! nothing but the jar
2793,ACT III.,Of distant portals shaken by the wind.
2794,ACT III.,
2795,ACT III.,_Alt._ It sounded like the clash of--hark again!
2796,ACT III.,
2797,ACT III.,_Zam._ The big rain pattering on the roof.
2798,ACT III.,
2799,ACT III.,_Sar._                                      No more.
2800,ACT III.,"Myrrha, my love, hast thou thy shell in order?"
2801,ACT III.,"Sing me a song of Sappho[18]; her, thou know'st,"
2802,ACT III.,Who in thy country threw----
2803,ACT III.,
2804,ACT III.,"_Enter_ PANIA, _with his sword and garments bloody, and"
2805,ACT III.,disordered. The guests rise in confusion_.
2806,ACT III.,
2807,ACT III.,_Pan._ (_to the Guards_).   Look to the portals;
2808,ACT III.,And with your best speed to the walls without.
2809,ACT III.,Your arms! To arms! The King's in danger. Monarch                   70
2810,ACT III.,"Excuse this haste,--'tis faith."
2811,ACT III.,
2812,ACT III.,_Sar._                          Speak on.
2813,ACT III.,
2814,ACT III.,_Pan._                                   It is
2815,ACT III.,As Salemenes feared; the faithless Satraps----
2816,ACT III.,
2817,ACT III.,"_Sar._ You are wounded--give some wine. Take breath, good Pania."
2818,ACT III.,
2819,ACT III.,_Pan._ 'Tis nothing--a mere flesh wound. I am worn
2820,ACT III.,"More with my speed to warn my sovereign,"
2821,ACT III.,Than hurt in his defence.
2822,ACT III.,
2823,ACT III.,"_Myr._                    Well, Sir, the rebels?"
2824,ACT III.,
2825,ACT III.,_Pan._ Soon as Arbaces and Beleses reached
2826,ACT III.,"Their stations in the city, they refused"
2827,ACT III.,To march; and on my attempt to use the power
2828,ACT III.,"Which I was delegated with, they called                             80"
2829,ACT III.,"Upon their troops, who rose in fierce defiance."
2830,ACT III.,
2831,ACT III.,_Myr._ All?
2832,ACT III.,
2833,ACT III.,_Pan._     Too many.
2834,ACT III.,
2835,ACT III.,"_Sar._              Spare not of thy free speech,"
2836,ACT III.,To spare mine ears--the truth.
2837,ACT III.,
2838,ACT III.,_Pan._                       My own slight guard
2839,ACT III.,"Were faithful, and what's left of it is still so."
2840,ACT III.,
2841,ACT III.,_Myr._ And are these all the force still faithful?
2842,ACT III.,
2843,ACT III.,_Pan._                                            No--
2844,ACT III.,"The Bactrians, now led on by Salemenes,"
2845,ACT III.,"Who even then was on his way, still urged"
2846,ACT III.,"By strong suspicion of the Median chiefs,"
2847,ACT III.,"Are numerous, and make strong head against"
2848,ACT III.,"The rebels, fighting inch by inch, and forming                      90"
2849,ACT III.,"An orb around the palace, where they mean"
2850,ACT III.,"To centre all their force, and save the King."
2851,ACT III.,(_He hesitates_.) I am charged to----
2852,ACT III.,
2853,ACT III.,_Myr._                            'Tis no time for hesitation.
2854,ACT III.,
2855,ACT III.,_Pan._ Prince Salemenes doth implore the King
2856,ACT III.,"To arm himself, although but for a moment,"
2857,ACT III.,And show himself unto the soldiers: his
2858,ACT III.,Sole presence in this instant might do more
2859,ACT III.,Than hosts can do in his behalf.
2860,ACT III.,
2861,ACT III.,"_Sar._                           What, ho!"
2862,ACT III.,My armour there.
2863,ACT III.,
2864,ACT III.,_Myr._           And wilt thou?
2865,ACT III.,
2866,ACT III.,_Sar._                         Will I not?
2867,ACT III.,"Ho, there!--but seek not for the buckler: 'tis                     100"
2868,ACT III.,Too heavy:--a light cuirass and my sword.
2869,ACT III.,Where are the rebels?
2870,ACT III.,
2871,ACT III.,_Pan._                Scarce a furlong's length
2872,ACT III.,From the outward wall the fiercest conflict rages.
2873,ACT III.,
2874,ACT III.,"_Sar._ Then I may charge on horseback. Sfero, ho!"
2875,ACT III.,Order my horse out.--There is space enough
2876,ACT III.,"Even in our courts, and by the outer gate,"
2877,ACT III.,To marshal half the horsemen of Arabia.
2878,ACT III.,[_Exit_ SFERO _for the armour_.
2879,ACT III.,
2880,ACT III.,_Myr._ How I do love thee!
2881,ACT III.,
2882,ACT III.,_Sar._                     I ne'er doubted it.
2883,ACT III.,
2884,ACT III.,_Myr._ But now I know thee.
2885,ACT III.,
2886,ACT III.,_Sar._ (_to his Attendant_). Bring down my spear too--
2887,ACT III.,Where's Salemenes?
2888,ACT III.,
2889,ACT III.,"_Pan._             Where a soldier should be,                      110"
2890,ACT III.,In the thick of the fight.
2891,ACT III.,
2892,ACT III.,_Sar._                     Then hasten to him----Is
2893,ACT III.,"The path still open, and communication"
2894,ACT III.,Left 'twixt the palace and the phalanx?
2895,ACT III.,
2896,ACT III.,_Pan._                                  'Twas
2897,ACT III.,"When I late left him, and I have no fear;"
2898,ACT III.,"Our troops were steady, and the phalanx formed."
2899,ACT III.,
2900,ACT III.,"_Sar._ Tell him to spare his person for the present,"
2901,ACT III.,"And that I will not spare my own--and say,"
2902,ACT III.,I come.
2903,ACT III.,
2904,ACT III.,_Pan._ There's victory in the very word.                [_Exit_ PANIA.
2905,ACT III.,
2906,ACT III.,"_Sar._ Altada--Zames--forth, and arm ye! There"
2907,ACT III.,Is all in readiness in the armoury.                                120
2908,ACT III.,See that the women are bestowed in safety
2909,ACT III.,In the remote apartments: let a guard
2910,ACT III.,"Be set before them, with strict charge to quit"
2911,ACT III.,"The post but with their lives--command it, Zames."
2912,ACT III.,"Altada, arm yourself, and return here;"
2913,ACT III.,Your post is near our person.
2914,ACT III.,"[_Exeunt_ ZAMES, ALTADA, _and all save_ MYRRHA."
2915,ACT III.,
2916,ACT III.,"_Enter_ SFERO _and others with the King's Arms, etc._"
2917,ACT III.,
2918,ACT III.,_Sfe._                     King! your armour.
2919,ACT III.,
2920,ACT III.,_Sar._ (_arming himself_). Give me the cuirass--so: my baldric; now
2921,ACT III.,My sword: I had forgot the helm--where is it?
2922,ACT III.,"That's well--no, 'tis too heavy; you mistake, too--"
2923,ACT III.,"It was not this I meant, but that which bears                      130"
2924,ACT III.,A diadem around it.
2925,ACT III.,
2926,ACT III.,"_Sfe._              Sire, I deemed"
2927,ACT III.,That too conspicuous from the precious stones
2928,ACT III.,"To risk your sacred brow beneath--and trust me,"
2929,ACT III.,"This is of better metal, though less rich."
2930,ACT III.,
2931,ACT III.,_Sar._ You deemed! Are you too turned a rebel? Fellow!
2932,ACT III.,"Your part is to obey: return, and--no--"
2933,ACT III.,It is too late--I will go forth without it.
2934,ACT III.,
2935,ACT III.,"_Sfe._ At least, wear this."
2936,ACT III.,
2937,ACT III.,"_Sar._                       Wear Caucasus! why, 'tis"
2938,ACT III.,A mountain on my temples.
2939,ACT III.,
2940,ACT III.,"_Sfe._                    Sire, the meanest"
2941,ACT III.,Soldier goes not forth thus exposed to battle.                     140
2942,ACT III.,All men will recognise you--for the storm
2943,ACT III.,"Has ceased, and the moon breaks forth in her brightness."
2944,ACT III.,
2945,ACT III.,"_Sar._ I go forth to be recognised, and thus"
2946,ACT III.,Shall be so sooner. Now--my spear! I'm armed.
2947,ACT III.,"[_In going stops short, and turns to_ SFERO."
2948,ACT III.,Sfero--I had forgotten--bring the mirror[19].
2949,ACT III.,
2950,ACT III.,"_Sfe._ The mirror, Sire?"
2951,ACT III.,
2952,ACT III.,"_Sar._                   Yes, sir, of polished brass,"
2953,ACT III.,Brought from the spoils of India--but be speedy.
2954,ACT III.,[_Exit_ SFERO.
2955,ACT III.,
2956,ACT III.,"_Sar._ Myrrha, retire unto a place of safety."
2957,ACT III.,Why went you not forth with the other damsels?
2958,ACT III.,
2959,ACT III.,_Myr._ Because my place is here.
2960,ACT III.,
2961,ACT III.,_Sar._                           And when I am gone----            150
2962,ACT III.,
2963,ACT III.,_Myr._ I follow.
2964,ACT III.,
2965,ACT III.,_Sar._           _You!_ to battle?
2966,ACT III.,
2967,ACT III.,"_Myr._                             If it were so,"
2968,ACT III.,'Twere not the first Greek girl had trod the path.
2969,ACT III.,I will await here your _return_.
2970,ACT III.,
2971,ACT III.,_Sar._                        The place
2972,ACT III.,"Is spacious, and the first to be sought out,"
2973,ACT III.,"If they prevail; and, if it be so,"
2974,ACT III.,And I return not----
2975,ACT III.,
2976,ACT III.,_Myr._               Still we meet again.
2977,ACT III.,
2978,ACT III.,_Sar._ How?
2979,ACT III.,
2980,ACT III.,_Myr._      In the spot where all must meet at last--
2981,ACT III.,"In Hades! if there be, as I believe,"
2982,ACT III.,"A shore beyond the Styx; and if there be not,"
2983,ACT III.,In ashes.
2984,ACT III.,
2985,ACT III.,_Sar._    Darest thou so much?
2986,ACT III.,
2987,ACT III.,_Myr._                         I dare all things                   160
2988,ACT III.,"Except survive what I have loved, to be"
2989,ACT III.,"A rebel's booty: forth, and do your bravest."
2990,ACT III.,
2991,ACT III.,_Re-enter_ SFERO _with the mirror_.
2992,ACT III.,
2993,ACT III.,_Sar._ (_looking at himself_).
2994,ACT III.,"This cuirass fits me well, the baldric better,"
2995,ACT III.,And the helm not at all. Methinks I seem
2996,ACT III.,[_Flings away the helmet after trying it again_.
2997,ACT III.,Passing well in these toys; and now to prove them.
2998,ACT III.,Altada! Where's Altada?
2999,ACT III.,
3000,ACT III.,"_Sfe._                  Waiting, Sire,"
3001,ACT III.,Without: he has your shield in readiness.
3002,ACT III.,
3003,ACT III.,_Sar._ True--I forgot--he is my shield-bearer
3004,ACT III.,"By right of blood, derived from age to age."
3005,ACT III.,"Myrrha, embrace me;--yet once more--once more--                    170"
3006,ACT III.,"Love me, whate'er betide. My chiefest glory"
3007,ACT III.,Shall be to make me worthier of your love.
3008,ACT III.,
3009,ACT III.,"_Myr._ Go forth, and conquer!"
3010,ACT III.,[_Exeunt_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SFERO.
3011,ACT III.,"Now, I am alone:"
3012,ACT III.,"All are gone forth, and of that all how few"
3013,ACT III.,"Perhaps return! Let him but vanquish, and"
3014,ACT III.,"Me perish! If he vanquish not, I perish;"
3015,ACT III.,For I will not outlive him. He has wound
3016,ACT III.,"About my heart, I know not how nor why."
3017,ACT III.,Not for that he is King; for now his kingdom
3018,ACT III.,"Rocks underneath his throne, and the earth yawns                   180"
3019,ACT III.,To yield him no more of it than a grave;
3020,ACT III.,"And yet I love him more. Oh, mighty Jove!"
3021,ACT III.,"Forgive this monstrous love for a barbarian,"
3022,ACT III.,"Who knows not of Olympus! yes, I love him"
3023,ACT III.,Now--now--far more than----Hark--to the war shout!
3024,ACT III.,"Methinks it nears me. If it should be so,"
3025,ACT III.,[_She draws forth a small vial_.
3026,ACT III.,"This cunning Colchian poison, which my father"
3027,ACT III.,"Learned to compound on Euxine shores, and taught me"
3028,ACT III.,"How to preserve, shall free me! It had freed me"
3029,ACT III.,"Long ere this hour, but that I loved until                         190"
3030,ACT III.,I half forgot I was a slave:--where all
3031,ACT III.,"Are slaves save One, and proud of servitude,"
3032,ACT III.,So they are served in turn by something lower
3033,ACT III.,In the degree of bondage: we forget
3034,ACT III.,That shackles worn like ornaments no less
3035,ACT III.,Are chains. Again that shout! and now the clash
3036,ACT III.,Of arms--and now--and now----
3037,ACT III.,
3038,ACT III.,_Enter_ ALTADA.
3039,ACT III.,
3040,ACT III.,"_Alt._                        Ho, Sfero, ho!"
3041,ACT III.,
3042,ACT III.,_Myr._ He is not here; what wouldst thou with him? How
3043,ACT III.,Goes on the conflict?
3044,ACT III.,
3045,ACT III.,_Alt._                Dubiously and fiercely.
3046,ACT III.,
3047,ACT III.,_Myr._ And the King?
3048,ACT III.,
3049,ACT III.,"_Alt._              Like a king. I must find Sfero,                200"
3050,ACT III.,And bring him a new spear with his own helmet.[w]
3051,ACT III.,"He fights till now bare-headed, and by far"
3052,ACT III.,"Too much exposed. The soldiers knew his face,"
3053,ACT III.,"And the foe too; and in the moon's broad light,"
3054,ACT III.,His silk tiara and his flowing hair
3055,ACT III.,Make him a mark too royal. Every arrow
3056,ACT III.,"Is pointed at the fair hair and fair features,"
3057,ACT III.,And the broad fillet which crowns both.
3058,ACT III.,
3059,ACT III.,"_Myr._                                 Ye Gods,"
3060,ACT III.,"Who fulminate o'er my father's land, protect him!"
3061,ACT III.,Were you sent by the King?
3062,ACT III.,
3063,ACT III.,"_Alt._                     By Salemenes,                           210"
3064,ACT III.,"Who sent me privily upon this charge,"
3065,ACT III.,Without the knowledge of the careless sovereign.
3066,ACT III.,The King! the King fights as he revels! ho!
3067,ACT III.,"What, Sfero! I will seek the armoury--"
3068,ACT III.,He must be there.                                      [_Exit_ ALTADA.
3069,ACT III.,
3070,ACT III.,_Myr._           'Tis no dishonour--no--
3071,ACT III.,'Tis no dishonour to have loved this man.
3072,ACT III.,"I almost wish now, what I never wished"
3073,ACT III.,Before--that he were Grecian. If Alcides
3074,ACT III.,Were shamed in wearing Lydian Omphale's
3075,ACT III.,"She-garb, and wielding her vile distaff; surely                    220"
3076,ACT III.,"He, who springs up a Hercules at once,"
3077,ACT III.,"Nursed in effeminate arts from youth to manhood,"
3078,ACT III.,"And rushes from the banquet to the battle,"
3079,ACT III.,"As though it were a bed of love, deserves"
3080,ACT III.,"That a Greek girl should be his paramour,"
3081,ACT III.,And a Greek bard his minstrel--a Greek tomb
3082,ACT III.,"His monument. How goes the strife, sir?"
3083,ACT III.,
3084,ACT III.,_Enter an Officer_.
3085,ACT III.,
3086,ACT III.,"_Officer_.                            Lost,"
3087,ACT III.,Lost almost past recovery. Zames! Where
3088,ACT III.,Is Zames?

3093,ACT III.,
3094,ACT III.,_Myr._ (_sola_). He's gone; and told no more than that all's lost!
3095,ACT III.,"What need have I to know more? In those words,"
3096,ACT III.,"Those little words, a kingdom and a king,"
3097,ACT III.,"A line of thirteen ages, and the lives"
3098,ACT III.,"Of thousands, and the fortune of all left"
3099,ACT III.,"With life, are merged; and I, too, with the great,"
3100,ACT III.,Like a small bubble breaking with the wave
3101,ACT III.,"Which bore it, shall be nothing. At the least,"
3102,ACT III.,My fate is in my keeping: no proud victor
3103,ACT III.,Shall count me with his spoils.
3104,ACT III.,
3105,ACT III.,_Enter_ PANIA.
3106,ACT III.,
3107,ACT III.,"_Pan._                         Away with me,                       240"

3112,ACT III.,
3113,ACT III.,"_Pan._ Sent me here to conduct you hence, beyond"

3115,ACT III.,
3116,ACT III.,_Myr._                          Then

3118,ACT III.,
3119,ACT III.,"_Pan._         And charged me to secure your life,"
3120,ACT III.,"And beg you to live on for his sake, till"
3121,ACT III.,He can rejoin you.
3122,ACT III.,
3123,ACT III.,_Myr._             Will he then give way?
3124,ACT III.,
3125,ACT III.,"_Pan._ Not till the last. Still, still he does whate'er"
3126,ACT III.,Despair can do; and step by step disputes
3127,ACT III.,The very palace.
3128,ACT III.,
3129,ACT III.,"_Myr._           They are here, then:--aye,                        250"
3130,ACT III.,"Their shouts come ringing through the ancient halls,"
3131,ACT III.,Never profaned by rebel echoes till
3132,ACT III.,"This fatal night. Farewell, Assyria's line!"
3133,ACT III.,Farewell to all of Nimrod! Even the name

3137,ACT III.,
3138,ACT III.,"_Myr._ No: I'll die here!--Away, and tell your King"
3139,ACT III.,I loved him to the last.

3156,ACT III.,"My faithful Bactrians, I will henceforth be"

3161,ACT III.,
3162,ACT III.,_Enter_ BELESES _and_ ARBACES _with the Rebels_.
3163,ACT III.,
3164,ACT III.,"_Arb._ Set on, we have them in the toil. Charge!"
3165,ACT III.,charge!
3166,ACT III.,
3167,ACT III.,"_Bel._ On! on!--Heaven fights for us, and with us--On!"
3168,ACT III.,
3169,ACT III.,"[_They charge the King and_ SALEMENES _with their troops,"
3170,ACT III.,who defend themselves till the arrival of_
3171,ACT III.,ZAMES _with the Guard before mentioned.

3173,ACT III.,"SALEMENES, _etc. As the King is going to join the"

3177,ACT III.,
3178,ACT III.,"_Sar._                                   Even so,                  270"

3184,ACT III.,_Bel._ Thine hour is come.
3185,ACT III.,
3186,ACT III.,"_Sar._                    No, thine.--I've lately read,"

3191,ACT III.,
3192,ACT III.,_Bel._                        But not by thee.
3193,ACT III.,[_They fight;_ BELESES _is wounded and disarmed_.

3195,ACT III.,"_Sar._ (_raising his sword to despatch him, exclaims_)--"

3199,ACT III.,[_A party of Rebels enter and rescue_ BELESES.
3200,ACT III.,"_They assail the King, who in turn, is"

3203,ACT III.,
3204,ACT III.,The villain was a prophet after all.
3205,ACT III.,Upon them--ho! there--victory is ours.

3215,ACT III.,Think not of me--a single soldier's arm
3216,ACT III.,"Must not be wanting now. I ask no guard,"
3217,ACT III.,"I need no guard: what, with a world at stake,"
3218,ACT III.,"Keep watch upon a woman? Hence, I say,                             290"

3235,ACT III.,_Alt._                       Myrrha!
3236,ACT III.,"What, gone? yet she was here when the fight raged,"
3237,ACT III.,And Pania also. Can aught have befallen them?
3238,ACT III.,
3239,ACT III.,"_Sfe._ I saw both safe, when late the rebels fled;"
3240,ACT III.,They probably are but retired to make
3241,ACT III.,Their way back to the harem.
3242,ACT III.,
3243,ACT III.,_Alt._                      If the King
3244,ACT III.,"Prove victor, as it seems even now he must,"

3247,ACT III.,
3248,ACT III.,_Sfe._                       Let us trace them:
3249,ACT III.,"She cannot be fled far; and, found, she makes                      310"
3250,ACT III.,A richer prize to our soft sovereign
3251,ACT III.,Than his recovered kingdom.

3254,ACT III.,"Ne'er fought more fiercely to win empire, than"
3255,ACT III.,His silken son to save it: he defies
3256,ACT III.,All augury of foes or friends; and like
3257,ACT III.,"The close and sultry summer's day, which bodes"
3258,ACT III.,"A twilight tempest, bursts forth in such thunder"
3259,ACT III.,As sweeps the air and deluges the earth.

3274,ACT III.,"Euphrates, who may still be true; nay, must be,"
3275,ACT III.,When they hear of our victory. But where
3276,ACT III.,Is the chief victor? where's the King?

3282,ACT III.,"_Sal._ Unhurt, I hope."
3283,ACT III.,
3284,ACT III.,_Sar._                 Not quite; but let it pass.                 330

3286,ACT III.,
3287,ACT III.,_Sal._                        And I trust the city.
3288,ACT III.,Our numbers gather; and I've ordered onward
3289,ACT III.,"A cloud of Parthians, hitherto reserved,"
3290,ACT III.,"All fresh and fiery, to be poured upon them"
3291,ACT III.,"In their retreat, which soon will be a flight."
3292,ACT III.,
3293,ACT III.,"_Sar._ It is already, or at least they marched"
3294,ACT III.,"Faster than I could follow with my Bactrians,"
3295,ACT III.,Who spared no speed. I am spent: give me a seat.
3296,ACT III.,
3297,ACT III.,"_Sal._ There stands the throne, Sire."
3298,ACT III.,
3299,ACT III.,"_Sar._                                Tis no place to rest on,"
3300,ACT III.,"For mind nor body: let me have a couch,                            340"
3301,ACT III.,[_They place a seat_.
3302,ACT III.,"A peasant's stool, I care not what: so--now"
3303,ACT III.,I breathe more freely.
3304,ACT III.,
3305,ACT III.,_Sal._                 This great hour has proved
3306,ACT III.,The brightest and most glorious of your life.
3307,ACT III.,
3308,ACT III.,_Sar._ And the most tiresome. Where's my cupbearer?
3309,ACT III.,Bring me some water.
3310,ACT III.,
3311,ACT III.,_Sal._ (_smiling_) 'Tis the first time he
3312,ACT III.,"Ever had such an order: even I,[z]"
3313,ACT III.,"Your most austere of counsellors, would now"
3314,ACT III.,Suggest a purpler beverage.
3315,ACT III.,
3316,ACT III.,_Sar._                    Blood--doubtless.
3317,ACT III.,"But there's enough of that shed; as for wine,"
3318,ACT III.,I have learned to-night the price of the pure element:             350
3319,ACT III.,"Thrice have I drank of it, and thrice renewed,"
3320,ACT III.,"With greater strength than the grape ever gave me,"
3321,ACT III.,My charge upon the rebels. Where's the soldier
3322,ACT III.,Who gave me water in his helmet?[20]
3323,ACT III.,
3324,ACT III.,"_One of the Guards_.              Slain, Sire!"
3325,ACT III.,"An arrow pierced his brain, while, scattering[aa]"
3326,ACT III.,"The last drops from his helm, he stood in act"
3327,ACT III.,To place it on his brows.
3328,ACT III.,
3329,ACT III.,_Sar._                   Slain! unrewarded!
3330,ACT III.,"And slain to serve my thirst: that's hard, poor slave!"
3331,ACT III.,"Had he but lived, I would have gorged him with"
3332,ACT III.,Gold: all the gold of earth could ne'er repay                      360
3333,ACT III.,The pleasure of that draught; for I was parched
3334,ACT III.,As I am now.                           [_They bring water--he drinks_.
3335,ACT III.,I live again--from henceforth
3336,ACT III.,"The goblet I reserve for hours of love,"
3337,ACT III.,But war on water.
3338,ACT III.,
3339,ACT III.,"_Sal._            And that bandage, Sire,"
3340,ACT III.,Which girds your arm?
3341,ACT III.,
3342,ACT III.,_Sar._                A scratch from brave Beleses.
3343,ACT III.,
3344,ACT III.,_Myr._ Oh! he is wounded![ab]
3345,ACT III.,
3346,ACT III.,_Sar._                        Not too much of that;
3347,ACT III.,"And yet it feels a little stiff and painful,"
3348,ACT III.,Now I am cooler.
3349,ACT III.,
3350,ACT III.,_Myr._           You have bound it with----
3351,ACT III.,
3352,ACT III.,_Sar._ The fillet of my diadem: the first time
3353,ACT III.,"That ornament was ever aught to me,                                370"
3354,ACT III.,Save an incumbrance.
3355,ACT III.,
3356,ACT III.,_Myr._ (_to the Attendants_). Summon speedily
3357,ACT III.,"A leech of the most skilful: pray, retire:"
3358,ACT III.,I will unbind your wound and tend it.
3359,ACT III.,
3360,ACT III.,"_Sar._                                Do so,"
3361,ACT III.,For now it throbs sufficiently: but what
3362,ACT III.,Know'st thou of wounds? yet wherefore do I ask?
3363,ACT III.,"Know'st thou, my brother, where I lighted on"
3364,ACT III.,This minion?
3365,ACT III.,
3366,ACT III.,"_Sal._       Herding with the other females,"
3367,ACT III.,Like frightened antelopes.
3368,ACT III.,
3369,ACT III.,_Sar._                     No: like the dam
3370,ACT III.,"Of the young lion, femininely raging"
3371,ACT III.,"(And femininely meaneth furiously,                                 380"
3372,ACT III.,"Because all passions in excess are female,)"
3373,ACT III.,"Against the hunter flying with her cub,"
3374,ACT III.,"She urged on with her voice and gesture, and"
3375,ACT III.,"Her floating hair and flashing eyes,[21] the soldiers,"
3376,ACT III.,In the pursuit.
3377,ACT III.,
3378,ACT III.,_Sal._         Indeed!
3379,ACT III.,
3380,ACT III.,"_Sar._                You see, this night"
3381,ACT III.,Made warriors of more than me. I paused
3382,ACT III.,"To look upon her, and her kindled cheek;"
3383,ACT III.,"Her large black eyes, that flashed through her long hair"
3384,ACT III.,As it streamed o'er her; her blue veins that rose
3385,ACT III.,Along her most transparent brow; her nostril                       390
3386,ACT III.,Dilated from its symmetry; her lips
3387,ACT III.,"Apart; her voice that clove through all the din,"
3388,ACT III.,"As a lute pierceth through the cymbal's clash,"
3389,ACT III.,Jarred but not drowned by the loud brattling; her
3390,ACT III.,"Waved arms, more dazzling with their own born whiteness"
3391,ACT III.,"Than the steel her hand held, which she caught up"
3392,ACT III.,From a dead soldier's grasp;--all these things made
3393,ACT III.,Her seem unto the troops a prophetess
3394,ACT III.,"Of victory, or Victory herself,"
3395,ACT III.,Come down to hail us hers.[22]
3396,ACT III.,
3397,ACT III.,_Sal._ (_aside_).           This is too much.                      400
3398,ACT III.,"Again the love-fit's on him, and all's lost,"
3399,ACT III.,"Unless we turn his thoughts. (_Aloud_.) But pray thee, Sire,"
3400,ACT III.,Think of your wound--you said even now 'twas painful.
3401,ACT III.,
3402,ACT III.,"_Sar._ That's true, too; but I must not think of it."
3403,ACT III.,
3404,ACT III.,"_Sal._ I have looked to all things needful, and will now"
3405,ACT III.,Receive reports of progress made in such
3406,ACT III.,"Orders as I had given, and then return"
3407,ACT III.,To hear your further pleasure.
3408,ACT III.,
3409,ACT III.,_Sar._                         Be it so.
3410,ACT III.,
3411,ACT III.,_Sal._ (_in retiring_). Myrrha!
3412,ACT III.,
3413,ACT III.,_Myr._                         Prince!
3414,ACT III.,
3415,ACT III.,"_Sal._         You have shown a soul to-night,"
3416,ACT III.,"Which, were he not my sister's lord----But now                     410"
3417,ACT III.,I have no time: thou lovest the King?
3418,ACT III.,
3419,ACT III.,_Myr._                               I love
3420,ACT III.,Sardanapalus.
3421,ACT III.,
3422,ACT III.,_Sal._         But wouldst have him King still?
3423,ACT III.,
3424,ACT III.,_Myr._ I would not have him less than what he should be.
3425,ACT III.,
3426,ACT III.,"_Sal._ Well then, to have him King, and yours, and all"
3427,ACT III.,"He should, or should not be; to have him _live_,"
3428,ACT III.,Let him not sink back into luxury.
3429,ACT III.,You have more power upon his spirit than
3430,ACT III.,"Wisdom within these walls, or fierce rebellion"
3431,ACT III.,Raging without: look well that he relapse not.
3432,ACT III.,
3433,ACT III.,_Myr._ There needed not the voice of Salemenes                     420
3434,ACT III.,To urge me on to this: I will not fail.
3435,ACT III.,All that a woman's weakness can----
3436,ACT III.,
3437,ACT III.,_Sal._                               Is power
3438,ACT III.,Omnipotent o'er such a heart as his:
3439,ACT III.,Exert it wisely.                                    [_Exit_ SALEMENES.
3440,ACT III.,
3441,ACT III.,"_Sar._           Myrrha! what, at whispers"
3442,ACT III.,With my stern brother? I shall soon be jealous.
3443,ACT III.,
3444,ACT III.,_Myr._ (_smiling_).
3445,ACT III.,"You have cause, Sire; for on the earth there breathes not"
3446,ACT III.,"A man more worthy of a woman's love,"
3447,ACT III.,"A soldier's trust, a subject's reverence,"
3448,ACT III.,A king's esteem--the whole world's admiration!
3449,ACT III.,
3450,ACT III.,"_Sar._ Praise him, but not so warmly. I must not                   430"
3451,ACT III.,Hear those sweet lips grow eloquent in aught
3452,ACT III.,That throws me into shade; yet you speak truth.
3453,ACT III.,
3454,ACT III.,"_Myr._ And now retire, to have your wound looked to,"
3455,ACT III.,Pray lean on me.
3456,ACT III.,
3457,ACT III.,"_Sar._          Yes, love! but not from pain."
3458,ACT III.,[_Exeunt omnes_.

3462,ACT III.,
3463,ACT IV.,ACT IV.
3464,ACT IV.,
3465,ACT IV.,SCENE I.--SARDANAPALUS _discovered sleeping upon a
3466,ACT IV.,"Couch, and occasionally disturbed in his slumbers,"
3467,ACT IV.,with_ MYRRHA _watching_.
3468,ACT IV.,
3469,ACT IV.,"_Myr._ (_sola, gazing_)."
3470,ACT IV.,"I have stolen upon his rest, if rest it be,"
3471,ACT IV.,Which thus convulses slumber: shall I wake him?
3472,ACT IV.,"No, he seems calmer. Oh, thou God of Quiet!"
3473,ACT IV.,"Whose reign is o'er sealed eyelids and soft dreams,"
3474,ACT IV.,"Or deep, deep sleep, so as to be unfathomed,"
3475,ACT IV.,"Look like thy brother, Death,[23]--so still, so stirless--"
3476,ACT IV.,"For then we are happiest, as it may be, we"
3477,ACT IV.,Are happiest of all within the realm
3478,ACT IV.,"Of thy stern, silent, and unwakening Twin."
3479,ACT IV.,Again he moves--again the play of pain                              10
3480,ACT IV.,"Shoots o'er his features, as the sudden gust"
3481,ACT IV.,Crisps the reluctant lake that lay so calm[ac]
3482,ACT IV.,Beneath the mountain shadow; or the blast
3483,ACT IV.,"Ruffles the autumn leaves, that drooping cling"
3484,ACT IV.,Faintly and motionless to their loved boughs.
3485,ACT IV.,I must awake him--yet not yet; who knows
3486,ACT IV.,From what I rouse him? It seems pain; but if
3487,ACT IV.,I quicken him to heavier pain? The fever
3488,ACT IV.,"Of this tumultuous night, the grief too of"
3489,ACT IV.,"His wound, though slight, may cause all this, and shake            20"
3490,ACT IV.,Me more to see than him to suffer. No:
3491,ACT IV.,"Let Nature use her own maternal means,"
3492,ACT IV.,"And I await to second, not disturb her."
3493,ACT IV.,
3494,ACT IV.,_Sar._ (_awakening_).
3495,ACT IV.,"Not so--although he multiplied the stars,"
3496,ACT IV.,And gave them to me as a realm to share
3497,ACT IV.,From you and with you! I would not so purchase
3498,ACT IV.,The empire of Eternity. Hence--hence--
3499,ACT IV.,"Old Hunter of the earliest brutes! and ye,[ad]"
3500,ACT IV.,Who hunted fellow-creatures as if brutes!
3501,ACT IV.,"Once bloody mortals--and now bloodier idols,                        30"
3502,ACT IV.,"If your priests lie not! And thou, ghastly Beldame!"
3503,ACT IV.,"Dripping with dusky gore, and trampling on"
3504,ACT IV.,The carcasses of Inde--away! away!
3505,ACT IV.,Where am I? Where the spectres? Where--No--that
3506,ACT IV.,Is no false phantom: I should know it 'midst
3507,ACT IV.,All that the dead dare gloomily raise up
3508,ACT IV.,From their black gulf to daunt the living. Myrrha!
3509,ACT IV.,
3510,ACT IV.,"_Myr._ Alas! thou art pale, and on thy brow the drops"
3511,ACT IV.,"Gather like night dew. My beloved, hush--"
3512,ACT IV.,"Calm thee. Thy speech seems of another world,                       40"
3513,ACT IV.,And thou art lord of this. Be of good cheer;
3514,ACT IV.,All will go well.
3515,ACT IV.,
3516,ACT IV.,_Sar._            Thy _hand_--so--'tis thy hand;
3517,ACT IV.,"'Tis flesh; grasp--clasp--yet closer, till I feel"
3518,ACT IV.,Myself that which I was.
3519,ACT IV.,
3520,ACT IV.,_Myr._                   At least know me
3521,ACT IV.,"For what I am, and ever must be--thine."
3522,ACT IV.,
3523,ACT IV.,_Sar._ I know it now. I know this life again.
3524,ACT IV.,"Ah, Myrrha! I have been where we shall be."
3525,ACT IV.,
3526,ACT IV.,_Myr._ My lord!
3527,ACT IV.,
3528,ACT IV.,_Sar._          I've been i' the grave--where worms are lords
3529,ACT IV.,And kings are----But I did not deem it so;
3530,ACT IV.,I thought 'twas nothing.
3531,ACT IV.,
3532,ACT IV.,_Myr._                   So it is; except                           50
3533,ACT IV.,"Unto the timid, who anticipate"
3534,ACT IV.,That which may never be.
3535,ACT IV.,
3536,ACT IV.,"_Sar._                   Oh, Myrrha! if"
3537,ACT IV.,"Sleep shows such things, what may not Death disclose?"
3538,ACT IV.,
3539,ACT IV.,"_Myr._ I know no evil Death can show, which Life"
3540,ACT IV.,Has not already shown to those who live
3541,ACT IV.,Embodied longest. If there be indeed
3542,ACT IV.,"A shore where Mind survives, 'twill be as Mind"
3543,ACT IV.,All unincorporate: or if there flits
3544,ACT IV.,A shadow of this cumbrous clog of clay.
3545,ACT IV.,"Which stalks, methinks, between our souls and heaven,               60"
3546,ACT IV.,"And fetters us to earth--at least the phantom,"
3547,ACT IV.,"Whate'er it have to fear, will not fear Death."
3548,ACT IV.,
3549,ACT IV.,_Sar._ I fear it not; but I have felt--have seen--
3550,ACT IV.,A legion of the dead.
3551,ACT IV.,
3552,ACT IV.,_Myr._                And so have I.
3553,ACT IV.,"The dust we tread upon was once alive,"
3554,ACT IV.,And wretched. But proceed: what hast thou seen?
3555,ACT IV.,"Speak it, 'twill lighten thy dimmed mind."
3556,ACT IV.,
3557,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                    Methought----
3558,ACT IV.,
3559,ACT IV.,"_Myr._ Yet pause, thou art tired--in pain--exhausted; all"
3560,ACT IV.,Which can impair both strength and spirit: seek
3561,ACT IV.,Rather to sleep again.
3562,ACT IV.,
3563,ACT IV.,_Sar._                 Not now--I would not                         70
3564,ACT IV.,Dream; though I know it now to be a dream
3565,ACT IV.,What I have dreamt:--and canst thou bear to hear it?
3566,ACT IV.,
3567,ACT IV.,"_Myr._ I can bear all things, dreams of life or death,"
3568,ACT IV.,Which I participate with you in semblance
3569,ACT IV.,Or full reality.
3570,ACT IV.,
3571,ACT IV.,"_Sar._           And this looked real,"
3572,ACT IV.,"I tell you: after that these eyes were open,"
3573,ACT IV.,I saw them in their flight--for then they fled.
3574,ACT IV.,
3575,ACT IV.,_Myr._ Say on.
3576,ACT IV.,
3577,ACT IV.,"_Sar._           I saw, that is, I dreamed myself"
3578,ACT IV.,"Here--here--even where we are, guests as we were,"
3579,ACT IV.,"Myself a host that deemed himself but guest,                        80"
3580,ACT IV.,Willing to equal all in social freedom;
3581,ACT IV.,"But, on my right hand and my left, instead"
3582,ACT IV.,"Of thee and Zames, and our customed meeting,"
3583,ACT IV.,"Was ranged on my left hand a haughty, dark,"
3584,ACT IV.,"And deadly face; I could not recognise it,"
3585,ACT IV.,"Yet I had seen it, though I knew not where:"
3586,ACT IV.,"The features were a Giant's, and the eye"
3587,ACT IV.,"Was still, yet lighted; his long locks curled down"
3588,ACT IV.,"On his vast bust, whence a huge quiver rose"
3589,ACT IV.,"With shaft-heads feathered from the eagle's wing,                   90"
3590,ACT IV.,That peeped up bristling through his serpent hair.[ae]
3591,ACT IV.,I invited him to fill the cup which stood
3592,ACT IV.,"Between us, but he answered not; I filled it;"
3593,ACT IV.,"He took it not, but stared upon me, till"
3594,ACT IV.,I trembled at the fixed glare of his eye:
3595,ACT IV.,I frowned upon him as a king should frown;
3596,ACT IV.,"He frowned not in his turn, but looked upon me"
3597,ACT IV.,"With the same aspect, which appalled me more,"
3598,ACT IV.,Because it changed not; and I turned for refuge
3599,ACT IV.,"To milder guests, and sought them on the right,                    100"
3600,ACT IV.,Where thou wert wont to be. But----                      [_He pauses_.
3601,ACT IV.,
3602,ACT IV.,_Myr._                           What instead?
3603,ACT IV.,
3604,ACT IV.,_Sar._ In thy own chair--thy own place in the banquet--
3605,ACT IV.,I sought thy sweet face in the circle--but
3606,ACT IV.,"Instead--a grey-haired, withered, bloody-eyed,"
3607,ACT IV.,"And bloody-handed, ghastly, ghostly thing,"
3608,ACT IV.,"Female in garb, and crowned upon the brow,"
3609,ACT IV.,"Furrowed with years, yet sneering with the passion"
3610,ACT IV.,"Of vengeance, leering too with that of lust,"
3611,ACT IV.,Sate:--my veins curdled.[24]
3612,ACT IV.,
3613,ACT IV.,_Myr._                Is this all?
3614,ACT IV.,
3615,ACT IV.,_Sar._                              Upon
3616,ACT IV.,"Her right hand--her lank, bird-like, right hand--stood             110"
3617,ACT IV.,"A goblet, bubbling o'er with blood; and on"
3618,ACT IV.,"Her left, another, filled with--what I saw not,"
3619,ACT IV.,But turned from it and her. But all along
3620,ACT IV.,"The table sate a range of crownéd wretches,"
3621,ACT IV.,"Of various aspects, but of one expression."
3622,ACT IV.,
3623,ACT IV.,_Myr._ And felt you not this a mere vision?
3624,ACT IV.,
3625,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                        No:
3626,ACT IV.,"It was so palpable, I could have touched them."
3627,ACT IV.,"I turned from one face to another, in"
3628,ACT IV.,The hope to find at last one which I knew
3629,ACT IV.,"Ere I saw theirs: but no--all turned upon me,                      120"
3630,ACT IV.,"And stared, but neither ate nor drank, but stared,"
3631,ACT IV.,"Till I grew stone, as they seemed half to be,"
3632,ACT IV.,"Yet breathing stone, for I felt life in them,"
3633,ACT IV.,And life in me: there was a horrid kind
3634,ACT IV.,"Of sympathy between us, as if they"
3635,ACT IV.,"Had lost a part of death to come to me,"
3636,ACT IV.,And I the half of life to sit by them.
3637,ACT IV.,We were in an existence all apart
3638,ACT IV.,From heaven or earth----And rather let me see
3639,ACT IV.,Death all than such a being!
3640,ACT IV.,
3641,ACT IV.,_Myr._                       And the end?                          130
3642,ACT IV.,
3643,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ At last I sate, marble, as they, when rose"
3644,ACT IV.,The Hunter and the Crone; and smiling on me--
3645,ACT IV.,"Yes, the enlarged but noble aspect of"
3646,ACT IV.,"The Hunter smiled upon me--I should say,"
3647,ACT IV.,"His lips, for his eyes moved not--and the woman's"
3648,ACT IV.,Thin lips relaxed to something like a smile.
3649,ACT IV.,"Both rose, and the crowned figures on each hand"
3650,ACT IV.,"Rose also, as if aping their chief shades--"
3651,ACT IV.,Mere mimics even in death--but I sate still:
3652,ACT IV.,"A desperate courage crept through every limb,                      140"
3653,ACT IV.,"And at the last I feared them not, but laughed"
3654,ACT IV.,Full in their phantom faces. But then--then
3655,ACT IV.,"The Hunter laid his hand on mine: I took it,"
3656,ACT IV.,And grasped it--but it melted from my own;
3657,ACT IV.,"While he too vanished, and left nothing but"
3658,ACT IV.,"The memory of a hero, for he looked so."
3659,ACT IV.,
3660,ACT IV.,"_Myr._ And was: the ancestor of heroes, too,"
3661,ACT IV.,And thine no less.
3662,ACT IV.,
3663,ACT IV.,"_Sar._             Aye, Myrrha, but the woman,"
3664,ACT IV.,"The female who remained, she flew upon me,"
3665,ACT IV.,And burnt my lips up with her noisome kisses;                      150
3666,ACT IV.,"And, flinging down the goblets on each hand,"
3667,ACT IV.,"Methought their poisons flowed around us, till"
3668,ACT IV.,Each formed a hideous river. Still she clung;
3669,ACT IV.,"The other phantoms, like a row of statues,"
3670,ACT IV.,"Stood dull as in our temples, but she still"
3671,ACT IV.,"Embraced me, while I shrunk from her, as if,"
3672,ACT IV.,"In lieu of her remote descendant, I"
3673,ACT IV.,Had been the son who slew her for her incest.[25]
3674,ACT IV.,Then--then--a chaos of all loathsome things
3675,ACT IV.,"Thronged thick and shapeless: I was dead, yet feeling--            160"
3676,ACT IV.,"Buried, and raised again--consumed by worms,"
3677,ACT IV.,"Purged by the flames, and withered in the air!"
3678,ACT IV.,"I can fix nothing further of my thoughts,"
3679,ACT IV.,"Save that I longed for thee, and sought for thee,"
3680,ACT IV.,"In all these agonies,--and woke and found thee."
3681,ACT IV.,
3682,ACT IV.,"_Myr._ So shalt thou find me ever at thy side,"
3683,ACT IV.,"Here and hereafter, if the last may be."
3684,ACT IV.,But think not of these things--the mere creations
3685,ACT IV.,"Of late events, acting upon a frame"
3686,ACT IV.,"Unused by toil, yet over-wrought by toil--                         170"
3687,ACT IV.,Such as might try the sternest.
3688,ACT IV.,
3689,ACT IV.,_Sar._                          I am better.
3690,ACT IV.,"Now that I see thee once more, _what was seen_"
3691,ACT IV.,Seems nothing.
3692,ACT IV.,
3693,ACT IV.,_Enter_ SALEMENES.
3694,ACT IV.,
3695,ACT IV.,_Sal._             Is the king so soon awake?
3696,ACT IV.,
3697,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ Yes, brother, and I would I had not slept;"
3698,ACT IV.,For all the predecessors of our line
3699,ACT IV.,"Rose up, methought, to drag me down to them."
3700,ACT IV.,"My father was amongst them, too; but he,"
3701,ACT IV.,"I know not why, kept from me, leaving me"
3702,ACT IV.,"Between the hunter-founder of our race,"
3703,ACT IV.,"And her, the homicide and husband-killer,                          180"
3704,ACT IV.,Whom you call glorious.
3705,ACT IV.,
3706,ACT IV.,"_Sal._                  So I term you also,"
3707,ACT IV.,Now you have shown a spirit like to hers.
3708,ACT IV.,"By day-break I propose that we set forth,"
3709,ACT IV.,"And charge once more the rebel crew, who still"
3710,ACT IV.,"Keep gathering head, repulsed, but not quite quelled."
3711,ACT IV.,
3712,ACT IV.,_Sar._ How wears the night?
3713,ACT IV.,
3714,ACT IV.,_Sal._                     There yet remain some hours
3715,ACT IV.,Of darkness: use them for your further rest.
3716,ACT IV.,
3717,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ No, not to-night, if 'tis not gone: methought"
3718,ACT IV.,I passed hours in that vision.
3719,ACT IV.,
3720,ACT IV.,_Myr._                         Scarcely one;
3721,ACT IV.,"I watched by you: it was a heavy hour,                             190"
3722,ACT IV.,But an hour only.
3723,ACT IV.,
3724,ACT IV.,_Sar._             Let us then hold council;
3725,ACT IV.,To-morrow we set forth.
3726,ACT IV.,
3727,ACT IV.,"_Sal._                 But ere that time,"
3728,ACT IV.,I had a grace to seek.
3729,ACT IV.,
3730,ACT IV.,_Sar._                'Tis granted.
3731,ACT IV.,
3732,ACT IV.,_Sal._                             Hear it
3733,ACT IV.,Ere you reply too readily; and 'tis
3734,ACT IV.,For _your_ ear only.
3735,ACT IV.,
3736,ACT IV.,"_Myr._              Prince, I take my leave."
3737,ACT IV.,[Exit MYRRHA.
3738,ACT IV.,
3739,ACT IV.,_Sal._ That slave deserves her freedom.
3740,ACT IV.,
3741,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                 Freedom only!
3742,ACT IV.,That slave deserves to share a throne.
3743,ACT IV.,
3744,ACT IV.,_Sal._                                 Your patience--
3745,ACT IV.,"'Tis not yet vacant, and 'tis of its partner"
3746,ACT IV.,I come to speak with you.
3747,ACT IV.,
3748,ACT IV.,_Sar._                   How! of the Queen?
3749,ACT IV.,
3750,ACT IV.,"_Sal._ Even so. I judged it fitting for their safety,              200"
3751,ACT IV.,"That, ere the dawn, she sets forth with her children"
3752,ACT IV.,"For Paphlagonia, where our kinsman Cotta[26]"
3753,ACT IV.,"Governs; and there, at all events, secure"
3754,ACT IV.,"My nephews and your sons their lives, and with them"
3755,ACT IV.,Their just pretensions to the crown in case----
3756,ACT IV.,
3757,ACT IV.,_Sar._ I perish--as is probable: well thought--
3758,ACT IV.,Let them set forth with a sure escort.
3759,ACT IV.,
3760,ACT IV.,_Sal._                                That
3761,ACT IV.,"Is all provided, and the galley ready"
3762,ACT IV.,To drop down the Euphrates; but ere they
3763,ACT IV.,"Depart, will you not see----"
3764,ACT IV.,
3765,ACT IV.,_Sar._                       My sons? It may                       210
3766,ACT IV.,"Unman my heart, and the poor boys will weep;"
3767,ACT IV.,"And what can I reply to comfort them,"
3768,ACT IV.,"Save with some hollow hopes, and ill-worn smiles?"
3769,ACT IV.,You know I cannot feign.
3770,ACT IV.,
3771,ACT IV.,_Sal._                  But you can feel!
3772,ACT IV.,"At least, I trust so: in a word, the Queen"
3773,ACT IV.,Requests to see you ere you part--for ever.
3774,ACT IV.,
3775,ACT IV.,_Sar._ Unto what end? what purpose? I will grant
3776,ACT IV.,Aught--all that she can ask--but such a meeting.
3777,ACT IV.,
3778,ACT IV.,"_Sal._ You know, or ought to know, enough of women,"
3779,ACT IV.,"Since you have studied them so steadily[af],                       220"
3780,ACT IV.,That what they ask in aught that touches on
3781,ACT IV.,"The heart, is dearer to their feelings or"
3782,ACT IV.,"Their fancy, than the whole external world."
3783,ACT IV.,I think as you do of my sister's wish;
3784,ACT IV.,But 'twas her wish--she is my sister--you
3785,ACT IV.,Her husband--will you grant it?
3786,ACT IV.,
3787,ACT IV.,_Sar._                         'Twill be useless:
3788,ACT IV.,But let her come.
3789,ACT IV.,
3790,ACT IV.,_Sal._            I go.                             [_Exit_ SALEMENES.
3791,ACT IV.,
3792,ACT IV.,_Sar._                 We have lived asunder
3793,ACT IV.,Too long to meet again--and _now_ to meet!
3794,ACT IV.,"Have I not cares enow, and pangs enow,"
3795,ACT IV.,"To bear alone, that we must mingle sorrows,                        230"
3796,ACT IV.,Who have ceased to mingle love?
3797,ACT IV.,
3798,ACT IV.,_Re-enter_ SALEMENES _and_ ZARINA.
3799,ACT IV.,
3800,ACT IV.,_Sal._                          My sister! Courage:
3801,ACT IV.,"Shame not our blood with trembling, but remember"
3802,ACT IV.,"From whence we sprung. The Queen is present, Sire."
3803,ACT IV.,
3804,ACT IV.,"_Zar._ I pray thee, brother, leave me."
3805,ACT IV.,
3806,ACT IV.,_Sal._                                Since you ask it.
3807,ACT IV.,[_Exit_ SALEMENES.
3808,ACT IV.,
3809,ACT IV.,"_Zar._ Alone with him! How many a year has passed[27],"
3810,ACT IV.,"Though we are still so young, since we have met,"
3811,ACT IV.,Which I have worn in widowhood of heart.
3812,ACT IV.,He loved me not: yet he seems little changed--
3813,ACT IV.,Changed to me only--would the change were mutual!
3814,ACT IV.,"He speaks not--scarce regards me--not a word,                      240"
3815,ACT IV.,"Nor look--yet he _was_ soft of voice and aspect,"
3816,ACT IV.,"Indifferent, not austere. My Lord!"
3817,ACT IV.,
3818,ACT IV.,_Sar._                            Zarina!
3819,ACT IV.,
3820,ACT IV.,"_Zar._ No, _not_ Zarina--do not say Zarina."
3821,ACT IV.,"That tone--That word--annihilate long years,"
3822,ACT IV.,And things which make them longer.
3823,ACT IV.,
3824,ACT IV.,_Sar._                             'Tis too late
3825,ACT IV.,To think of these past dreams. Let's not reproach--
3826,ACT IV.,"That is, reproach me not--for the _last_ time----"
3827,ACT IV.,
3828,ACT IV.,"_Zar._ And _first_, I ne'er reproached you."
3829,ACT IV.,
3830,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                     'Tis most true;
3831,ACT IV.,And that reproof comes heavier on my heart
3832,ACT IV.,Than----But our hearts are not in our own power.                  250
3833,ACT IV.,
3834,ACT IV.,_Zar._ Nor hands; but I gave both.
3835,ACT IV.,
3836,ACT IV.,_Sar._                            Your brother said
3837,ACT IV.,"It was your will to see me, ere you went"
3838,ACT IV.,From Nineveh with----(_He hesitates_.)
3839,ACT IV.,
3840,ACT IV.,_Zar._               Our children: it is true.
3841,ACT IV.,I wish to thank you that you have not divided
3842,ACT IV.,My heart from all that's left it now to love--
3843,ACT IV.,"Those who are yours and mine, who look like you,"
3844,ACT IV.,And look upon me as you looked upon me
3845,ACT IV.,Once----but _they_ have not changed.
3846,ACT IV.,
3847,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                Nor ever will.
3848,ACT IV.,I fain would have them dutiful.
3849,ACT IV.,
3850,ACT IV.,_Zar._                         I cherish
3851,ACT IV.,"Those infants, not alone from the blind love                       260"
3852,ACT IV.,"Of a fond mother, but as a fond woman."
3853,ACT IV.,They are now the only tie between us.
3854,ACT IV.,
3855,ACT IV.,_Sar._                               Deem not
3856,ACT IV.,I have not done you justice: rather make them
3857,ACT IV.,Resemble your own line than their own Sire.
3858,ACT IV.,I trust them with you--to you: fit them for
3859,ACT IV.,"A throne, or, if that be denied----You have heard"
3860,ACT IV.,Of this night's tumults?
3861,ACT IV.,
3862,ACT IV.,"_Zar._                  I had half forgotten,"
3863,ACT IV.,"And could have welcomed any grief save yours,"
3864,ACT IV.,Which gave me to behold your face again.
3865,ACT IV.,
3866,ACT IV.,_Sar._ The throne--I say it not in fear--but 'tis                  270
3867,ACT IV.,In peril: they perhaps may never mount it:
3868,ACT IV.,But let them not for this lose sight of it.
3869,ACT IV.,I will dare all things to bequeath it them;
3870,ACT IV.,"But if I fail, then they must win it back"
3871,ACT IV.,"Bravely--and, won, wear it wisely, not as I[ag]"
3872,ACT IV.,Have wasted down my royalty.
3873,ACT IV.,
3874,ACT IV.,_Zar._                      They ne'er
3875,ACT IV.,Shall know from me of aught but what may honour
3876,ACT IV.,Their father's memory.
3877,ACT IV.,
3878,ACT IV.,_Sar._                 Rather let them hear
3879,ACT IV.,The truth from you than from a trampling world.
3880,ACT IV.,"If they be in adversity, they'll learn                             280"
3881,ACT IV.,"Too soon the scorn of crowds for crownless Princes,"
3882,ACT IV.,And find that all their father's sins are theirs.
3883,ACT IV.,My boys!--I could have borne it were I childless.
3884,ACT IV.,
3885,ACT IV.,_Zar._ Oh! do not say so--do not poison all
3886,ACT IV.,"My peace left, by unwishing that thou wert"
3887,ACT IV.,"A father. If thou conquerest, they shall reign,"
3888,ACT IV.,"And honour him who saved the realm for them,"
3889,ACT IV.,So little cared for as his own; and if----
3890,ACT IV.,
3891,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ 'Tis lost, all Earth will cry out, ""thank your father!"""
3892,ACT IV.,And they will swell the echo with a curse.                         290
3893,ACT IV.,
3894,ACT IV.,_Zar._ That they shall never do; but rather honour
3895,ACT IV.,"The name of him, who, dying like a king,"
3896,ACT IV.,In his last hours did more for his own memory
3897,ACT IV.,"Than many monarchs in a length of days,"
3898,ACT IV.,"Which date the flight of time, but make no annals."
3899,ACT IV.,
3900,ACT IV.,_Sar._ Our annals draw perchance unto their close;
3901,ACT IV.,"But at the least, whate'er the past, their end"
3902,ACT IV.,Shall be like their beginning--memorable.
3903,ACT IV.,
3904,ACT IV.,"_Zar._ Yet, be not rash--be careful of your life,"
3905,ACT IV.,Live but for those who love.
3906,ACT IV.,
3907,ACT IV.,_Sar._                       And who are they?                     300
3908,ACT IV.,"A slave, who loves from passion--I'll not say"
3909,ACT IV.,"Ambition--she has seen thrones shake, and loves;"
3910,ACT IV.,A few friends who have revelled till we are
3911,ACT IV.,"As one, for they are nothing if I fall;"
3912,ACT IV.,A brother I have injured--children whom
3913,ACT IV.,"I have neglected, and a spouse----"
3914,ACT IV.,
3915,ACT IV.,_Zar._                             Who loves.
3916,ACT IV.,
3917,ACT IV.,_Sar._ And pardons?
3918,ACT IV.,
3919,ACT IV.,"_Zar._               I have never thought of this,"
3920,ACT IV.,And cannot pardon till I have condemned.
3921,ACT IV.,
3922,ACT IV.,_Sar._ My wife!
3923,ACT IV.,
3924,ACT IV.,_Zar._          Now blessings on thee for that word!
3925,ACT IV.,I never thought to hear it more--from thee.                        310
3926,ACT IV.,
3927,ACT IV.,_Sar._ Oh! thou wilt hear it from my subjects. Yes--
3928,ACT IV.,"These slaves whom I have nurtured, pampered, fed,"
3929,ACT IV.,"And swoln with peace, and gorged with plenty, till"
3930,ACT IV.,They reign themselves--all monarchs in their mansions--
3931,ACT IV.,"Now swarm forth in rebellion, and demand"
3932,ACT IV.,"His death, who made their lives a jubilee;"
3933,ACT IV.,While the few upon whom I have no claim
3934,ACT IV.,"Are faithful! This is true, yet monstrous."
3935,ACT IV.,
3936,ACT IV.,_Zar._                                    'Tis
3937,ACT IV.,Perhaps too natural; for benefits
3938,ACT IV.,Turn poison in bad minds.
3939,ACT IV.,
3940,ACT IV.,_Sar._                    And good ones make                       320
3941,ACT IV.,"Good out of evil. Happier than the bee,"
3942,ACT IV.,Which hives not but from wholesome flowers.
3943,ACT IV.,
3944,ACT IV.,_Zar._                                     Then reap
3945,ACT IV.,"The honey, nor inquire whence 'tis derived."
3946,ACT IV.,Be satisfied--you are not all abandoned.
3947,ACT IV.,
3948,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ My life insures me that. How long, bethink you,"
3949,ACT IV.,"Were not I yet a king, should I be mortal;"
3950,ACT IV.,"That is, where mortals _are_, not where they must be?"
3951,ACT IV.,
3952,ACT IV.,"_Zar._ I know not. But yet live for my--that is,"
3953,ACT IV.,Your children's sake!
3954,ACT IV.,
3955,ACT IV.,"_Sar._                My gentle, wronged Zarina!"
3956,ACT IV.,I am the very slave of Circumstance                                330
3957,ACT IV.,And Impulse--borne away with every breath!
3958,ACT IV.,Misplaced upon the throne--misplaced in life.
3959,ACT IV.,"I know not what I could have been, but feel"
3960,ACT IV.,I am not what I should be--let it end.
3961,ACT IV.,But take this with thee: if I was not formed
3962,ACT IV.,"To prize a love like thine, a mind like thine,"
3963,ACT IV.,Nor dote even on thy beauty--as I've doted
3964,ACT IV.,"On lesser charms, for no cause save that such"
3965,ACT IV.,"Devotion was a duty, and I hated"
3966,ACT IV.,All that looked like a chain for me or others                      340
3967,ACT IV.,(This even Rebellion must avouch); yet hear
3968,ACT IV.,"These words, perhaps among my last--that none"
3969,ACT IV.,"E'er valued more thy virtues, though he knew not"
3970,ACT IV.,To profit by them--as the miner lights
3971,ACT IV.,"Upon a vein of virgin ore, discovering"
3972,ACT IV.,"That which avails him nothing: he hath found it,"
3973,ACT IV.,"But 'tis not his--but some superior's, who"
3974,ACT IV.,"Placed him to dig, but not divide the wealth"
3975,ACT IV.,Which sparkles at his feet; nor dare he lift
3976,ACT IV.,"Nor poise it, but must grovel on, upturning                        350"
3977,ACT IV.,The sullen earth.
3978,ACT IV.,
3979,ACT IV.,_Zar._            Oh! if thou hast at length
3980,ACT IV.,"Discovered that my love is worth esteem,"
3981,ACT IV.,"I ask no more--but let us hence together,"
3982,ACT IV.,And _I_--let me say _we_--shall yet be happy.
3983,ACT IV.,Assyria is not all the earth--we'll find
3984,ACT IV.,A world out of our own--and be more blessed
3985,ACT IV.,"Than I have ever been, or thou, with all"
3986,ACT IV.,An empire to indulge thee.
3987,ACT IV.,
3988,ACT IV.,_Enter_ SALEMENES.
3989,ACT IV.,
3990,ACT IV.,_Sal._                    I must part ye--
3991,ACT IV.,"The moments, which must not be lost, are passing."
3992,ACT IV.,
3993,ACT IV.,_Zar._ Inhuman brother! wilt thou thus weigh out                   360
3994,ACT IV.,Instants so high and blest?
3995,ACT IV.,
3996,ACT IV.,_Sal._                      Blest!
3997,ACT IV.,
3998,ACT IV.,_Zar._                             He hath been
3999,ACT IV.,"So gentle with me, that I cannot think"
4000,ACT IV.,Of quitting.
4001,ACT IV.,
4002,ACT IV.,_Sal._       So--this feminine farewell
4003,ACT IV.,"Ends as such partings end, in _no_ departure."
4004,ACT IV.,"I thought as much, and yielded against all"
4005,ACT IV.,My better bodings. But it must not be.
4006,ACT IV.,
4007,ACT IV.,_Zar._ Not be?
4008,ACT IV.,
4009,ACT IV.,"_Sal._         Remain, and perish----"
4010,ACT IV.,
4011,ACT IV.,_Zar._                               With my husband----
4012,ACT IV.,
4013,ACT IV.,_Sal._ And children.
4014,ACT IV.,
4015,ACT IV.,_Zar._                Alas!
4016,ACT IV.,
4017,ACT IV.,"_Sal._                       Hear me, sister, like"
4018,ACT IV.,_My_ sister:--all's prepared to make your safety
4019,ACT IV.,"Certain, and of the boys too, our last hopes;                      370"
4020,ACT IV.,"'Tis not a single question of mere feeling,"
4021,ACT IV.,Though that were much--but 'tis a point of state:
4022,ACT IV.,The rebels would do more to seize upon
4023,ACT IV.,"The offspring of their sovereign, and so crush----"
4024,ACT IV.,
4025,ACT IV.,_Zar._ Ah! do not name it.
4026,ACT IV.,
4027,ACT IV.,"_Sal._                      Well, then, mark me: when"
4028,ACT IV.,"They are safe beyond the Median's grasp, the rebels"
4029,ACT IV.,Have missed their chief aim--the extinction of
4030,ACT IV.,The line of Nimrod. Though the present King
4031,ACT IV.,"Fall, his sons live--for victory and vengeance."
4032,ACT IV.,
4033,ACT IV.,"_Zar._ But could not I remain, alone?"
4034,ACT IV.,
4035,ACT IV.,_Sal._                                What! leave                  380
4036,ACT IV.,"Your children, with two parents and yet orphans--"
4037,ACT IV.,"In a strange land--so young, so distant?"
4038,ACT IV.,
4039,ACT IV.,_Zar._                                   No--
4040,ACT IV.,My heart will break.
4041,ACT IV.,
4042,ACT IV.,_Sal._               Now you know all--decide.
4043,ACT IV.,
4044,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ Zarina, he hath spoken well, and we"
4045,ACT IV.,Must yield awhile to this necessity.
4046,ACT IV.,"Remaining here, you may lose all; departing,"
4047,ACT IV.,"You save the better part of what is left,"
4048,ACT IV.,"To both of us, and to such loyal hearts"
4049,ACT IV.,As yet beat in these kingdoms.
4050,ACT IV.,
4051,ACT IV.,_Sal._                         The time presses.
4052,ACT IV.,
4053,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ Go, then. If e'er we meet again, perhaps                    390"
4054,ACT IV.,"I may be worthier of you--and, if not,"
4055,ACT IV.,"Remember that my faults, though not atoned for,"
4056,ACT IV.,"Are _ended_. Yet, I dread thy nature will"
4057,ACT IV.,Grieve more above the blighted name and ashes
4058,ACT IV.,Which once were mightiest in Assyria--than----
4059,ACT IV.,"But I grow womanish again, and must not;"
4060,ACT IV.,I must learn sternness now. My sins have all
4061,ACT IV.,Been of the softer order----_hide_ thy tears--
4062,ACT IV.,I do not bid thee _not_ to shed them--'twere
4063,ACT IV.,Easier to stop Euphrates at its source                             400
4064,ACT IV.,Than one tear of a true and tender heart--
4065,ACT IV.,But let me not behold them; they unman me
4066,ACT IV.,"Here when I had remanned myself. My brother,"
4067,ACT IV.,Lead her away.
4068,ACT IV.,
4069,ACT IV.,"_Zar._         Oh, God! I never shall"
4070,ACT IV.,Behold him more!
4071,ACT IV.,
4072,ACT IV.,_Sal._ (_striving to conduct her_).
4073,ACT IV.,"Nay, sister, I _must_ be obeyed."
4074,ACT IV.,
4075,ACT IV.,_Zar._ I must remain--away! you shall not hold me.
4076,ACT IV.,"What, shall he die alone?--_I_ live alone?"
4077,ACT IV.,
4078,ACT IV.,_Sal._ He shall _not die alone_; but lonely you
4079,ACT IV.,Have lived for years.
4080,ACT IV.,
4081,ACT IV.,"_Zar._                That's false! I knew _he_ lived,"
4082,ACT IV.,And lived upon his image--let me go!                               410
4083,ACT IV.,
4084,ACT IV.,_Sal._ (_conducting her off the stage_).
4085,ACT IV.,"Nay, then, I must use some fraternal force,"
4086,ACT IV.,Which you will pardon.
4087,ACT IV.,
4088,ACT IV.,_Zar._                 Never. Help me! Oh!
4089,ACT IV.,"Sardanapalus, wilt thou thus behold me"
4090,ACT IV.,Torn from thee?
4091,ACT IV.,
4092,ACT IV.,"_Sal._          Nay--then all is lost again,"
4093,ACT IV.,If that this moment is not gained.
4094,ACT IV.,
4095,ACT IV.,_Zar._                             My brain turns--
4096,ACT IV.,My eyes fail--where is he?                              [_She faints_.
4097,ACT IV.,
4098,ACT IV.,_Sar._ (_advancing_).     No--set her down;
4099,ACT IV.,She's dead--and you have slain her.
4100,ACT IV.,
4101,ACT IV.,_Sal._                             'Tis the mere
4102,ACT IV.,Faintness of o'erwrought passion: in the air
4103,ACT IV.,"She will recover. Pray, keep back.--[_Aside_.] I must"
4104,ACT IV.,Avail myself of this sole moment to                                420
4105,ACT IV.,"Bear her to where her children are embarked,"
4106,ACT IV.,I' the royal galley on the river.
4107,ACT IV.,[SALEMENES _bears her off_.
4108,ACT IV.,
4109,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ (_solus_).               This, too--"
4110,ACT IV.,"And this too must I suffer--I, who never"
4111,ACT IV.,Inflicted purposely on human hearts
4112,ACT IV.,A voluntary pang! But that is false--
4113,ACT IV.,"She loved me, and I loved her.--Fatal passion!"
4114,ACT IV.,Why dost thou not expire at _once_ in hearts
4115,ACT IV.,Which thou hast lighted up at once? Zarina![ah]
4116,ACT IV.,I must pay dearly for the desolation
4117,ACT IV.,Now brought upon thee. Had I never loved                           430
4118,ACT IV.,"But thee, I should have been an unopposed"
4119,ACT IV.,Monarch of honouring nations. To what gulfs
4120,ACT IV.,A single deviation from the track
4121,ACT IV.,Of human duties leads even those who claim
4122,ACT IV.,"The homage of mankind as their born due,"
4123,ACT IV.,"And find it, till they forfeit it themselves!"
4124,ACT IV.,
4125,ACT IV.,_Enter_ MYRRHA.
4126,ACT IV.,
4127,ACT IV.,_Sar._ _You_ here! Who called you?
4128,ACT IV.,
4129,ACT IV.,_Myr._                             No one--but I heard
4130,ACT IV.,"Far off a voice of wail and lamentation,"
4131,ACT IV.,And thought----
4132,ACT IV.,
4133,ACT IV.,_Sar._           It forms no portion of your duties
4134,ACT IV.,To enter here till sought for.
4135,ACT IV.,
4136,ACT IV.,"_Myr._                        Though I might,                      440"
4137,ACT IV.,"Perhaps, recall some softer words of yours"
4138,ACT IV.,"(Although they _too were chiding_), which reproved me,"
4139,ACT IV.,Because I ever dreaded to intrude;
4140,ACT IV.,Resisting my own wish and your injunction
4141,ACT IV.,"To heed no time nor presence, but approach you"
4142,ACT IV.,Uncalled for:--I retire.
4143,ACT IV.,
4144,ACT IV.,_Sar._                   Yet stay--being here.
4145,ACT IV.,I pray you pardon me: events have soured me
4146,ACT IV.,Till I wax peevish--heed it not: I shall
4147,ACT IV.,Soon be myself again.
4148,ACT IV.,
4149,ACT IV.,"_Myr._                I wait with patience,"
4150,ACT IV.,What I shall see with pleasure.
4151,ACT IV.,
4152,ACT IV.,_Sar._                          Scarce a moment                    450
4153,ACT IV.,"Before your entrance in this hall, Zarina,"
4154,ACT IV.,"Queen of Assyria, departed hence."
4155,ACT IV.,
4156,ACT IV.,_Myr._ Ah!
4157,ACT IV.,
4158,ACT IV.,_Sar._     Wherefore do you start?
4159,ACT IV.,
4160,ACT IV.,_Myr._                             Did I do so?
4161,ACT IV.,
4162,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ 'Twas well you entered by another portal,"
4163,ACT IV.,Else you had met. That pang at least is spared her!
4164,ACT IV.,
4165,ACT IV.,_Myr._ I know to feel for her.
4166,ACT IV.,
4167,ACT IV.,"_Sar._                          That is too much,"
4168,ACT IV.,And beyond nature--'tis nor mutual[ai]
4169,ACT IV.,"Nor possible. You cannot pity her,"
4170,ACT IV.,Nor she aught but----
4171,ACT IV.,
4172,ACT IV.,_Myr._                Despise the favourite slave?
4173,ACT IV.,Not more than I have ever scorned myself.                          460
4174,ACT IV.,
4175,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ Scorned! what, to be the envy of your sex,"
4176,ACT IV.,And lord it o'er the heart of the World's lord?
4177,ACT IV.,
4178,ACT IV.,_Myr._ Were you the lord of twice ten thousand worlds--
4179,ACT IV.,As you are like to lose the one you swayed--
4180,ACT IV.,I did abase myself as much in being
4181,ACT IV.,"Your paramour, as though you were a peasant--"
4182,ACT IV.,"Nay, more, if that the peasant were a Greek."
4183,ACT IV.,
4184,ACT IV.,_Sar._ You talk it well----
4185,ACT IV.,
4186,ACT IV.,_Myr._                      And truly.
4187,ACT IV.,
4188,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                In the hour
4189,ACT IV.,Of man's adversity all things grow daring
4190,ACT IV.,Against the falling; but as I am not                               470
4191,ACT IV.,"Quite fall'n, nor now disposed to bear reproaches,"
4192,ACT IV.,"Perhaps because I merit them too often,"
4193,ACT IV.,Let us then part while peace is still between us.
4194,ACT IV.,
4195,ACT IV.,_Myr._ Part!
4196,ACT IV.,
4197,ACT IV.,"_Sar._       Have not all past human beings parted,"
4198,ACT IV.,And must not all the present one day part?
4199,ACT IV.,
4200,ACT IV.,_Myr._ Why?
4201,ACT IV.,
4202,ACT IV.,"_Sar._     For your safety, which I will have looked to,"
4203,ACT IV.,With a strong escort to your native land;
4204,ACT IV.,"And such gifts, as, if you had not been all"
4205,ACT IV.,"A Queen, shall make your dowry worth a kingdom."
4206,ACT IV.,
4207,ACT IV.,_Myr._ I pray you talk not thus.
4208,ACT IV.,
4209,ACT IV.,_Sar._                          The Queen is gone:                 480
4210,ACT IV.,You need not shame to follow. I would fall
4211,ACT IV.,Alone--I seek no partners but in pleasure.
4212,ACT IV.,
4213,ACT IV.,_Myr._ And I no pleasure but in parting not.
4214,ACT IV.,You shall not force me from you.
4215,ACT IV.,
4216,ACT IV.,_Sar._                           Think well of it--
4217,ACT IV.,It soon may be too late.
4218,ACT IV.,
4219,ACT IV.,_Myr._                   So let it be;
4220,ACT IV.,For then you cannot separate me from you.
4221,ACT IV.,
4222,ACT IV.,_Sar._ And will not; but I thought you wished it.
4223,ACT IV.,
4224,ACT IV.,_Myr._                                             I!
4225,ACT IV.,
4226,ACT IV.,_Sar._ You spoke of your abasement.
4227,ACT IV.,
4228,ACT IV.,_Myr._                              And I feel it
4229,ACT IV.,Deeply--more deeply than all things but love.
4230,ACT IV.,
4231,ACT IV.,_Sar._ Then fly from it.
4232,ACT IV.,
4233,ACT IV.,_Myr._                  'Twill not recall the past--               490
4234,ACT IV.,"'Twill not restore my honour, nor my heart."
4235,ACT IV.,"No--here I stand or fall. If that you conquer,"
4236,ACT IV.,I live to joy in your great triumph: should
4237,ACT IV.,"Your lot be different, I'll not weep, but share it."
4238,ACT IV.,You did not doubt me a few hours ago.
4239,ACT IV.,
4240,ACT IV.,_Sar._ Your courage never--nor your love till now;
4241,ACT IV.,And none could make me doubt it save yourself.
4242,ACT IV.,Those words----
4243,ACT IV.,
4244,ACT IV.,"_Myr._            Were words. I pray you, let the proofs"
4245,ACT IV.,Be in the past acts you were pleased to praise
4246,ACT IV.,"This very night, and in my further bearing,                        500"
4247,ACT IV.,"Beside, wherever you are borne by fate."
4248,ACT IV.,
4249,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ I am content: and, trusting in my cause,"
4250,ACT IV.,Think we may yet be victors and return
4251,ACT IV.,To peace--the only victory I covet.
4252,ACT IV.,To me war is no glory--conquest no
4253,ACT IV.,Renown. To be forced thus to uphold my right
4254,ACT IV.,Sits heavier on my heart than all the wrongs[aj]
4255,ACT IV.,"These men would bow me down with. Never, never"
4256,ACT IV.,"Can I forget this night, even should I live"
4257,ACT IV.,To add it to the memory of others.                                 510
4258,ACT IV.,I thought to have made mine inoffensive rule
4259,ACT IV.,"An era of sweet peace 'midst bloody annals,"
4260,ACT IV.,"A green spot amidst desert centuries,"
4261,ACT IV.,"On which the Future would turn back and smile,"
4262,ACT IV.,"And cultivate, or sigh when it could not"
4263,ACT IV.,Recall Sardanapalus' golden reign.
4264,ACT IV.,"I thought to have made my realm a paradise,"
4265,ACT IV.,And every moon an epoch of new pleasures.
4266,ACT IV.,I took the rabble's shouts for love--the breath
4267,ACT IV.,Of friends for truth--the lips of woman for                        520
4268,ACT IV.,"My only guerdon--so they are, my Myrrha:             [_He kisses her_."
4269,ACT IV.,Kiss me. Now let them take my realm and life!
4270,ACT IV.,"They shall have both, but never _thee!_"
4271,ACT IV.,
4272,ACT IV.,"_Myr._                                 No, never!"
4273,ACT IV.,Man may despoil his brother man of all
4274,ACT IV.,"That's great or glittering--kingdoms fall, hosts yield,"
4275,ACT IV.,"Friends fail--slaves fly--and all betray--and, more"
4276,ACT IV.,"Than all, the most indebted--but a heart"
4277,ACT IV.,That loves without self-love! 'Tis here--now prove it.
4278,ACT IV.,
4279,ACT IV.,_Enter_ SALEMENES.
4280,ACT IV.,
4281,ACT IV.,_Sal._ I sought you--How! _she_ here again?
4282,ACT IV.,
4283,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                     Return not
4284,ACT IV.,_Now_ to reproof: methinks your aspect speaks                      530
4285,ACT IV.,Of higher matter than a woman's presence.
4286,ACT IV.,
4287,ACT IV.,_Sal._ The only woman whom it much imports me
4288,ACT IV.,At such a moment now is safe in absence--
4289,ACT IV.,The Queen's embarked.
4290,ACT IV.,
4291,ACT IV.,_Sar._                And well? say that much.
4292,ACT IV.,
4293,ACT IV.,_Sal._                                         Yes.
4294,ACT IV.,"Her transient weakness has passed o'er; at least,"
4295,ACT IV.,It settled into tearless silence: her
4296,ACT IV.,"Pale face and glittering eye, after a glance"
4297,ACT IV.,"Upon her sleeping children, were still fixed"
4298,ACT IV.,Upon the palace towers as the swift galley
4299,ACT IV.,Stole down the hurrying stream beneath the starlight;              540
4300,ACT IV.,But she said nothing.
4301,ACT IV.,
4302,ACT IV.,_Sar._                Would I felt no more
4303,ACT IV.,Than she has said!
4304,ACT IV.,
4305,ACT IV.,_Sal._             'Tis now too late to feel.
4306,ACT IV.,Your feelings cannot cancel a sole pang:
4307,ACT IV.,"To change them, my advices bring sure tidings"
4308,ACT IV.,"That the rebellious Medes and Chaldees, marshalled"
4309,ACT IV.,"By their two leaders, are already up"
4310,ACT IV.,"In arms again; and, serrying their ranks,"
4311,ACT IV.,Prepare to attack: they have apparently
4312,ACT IV.,Been joined by other Satraps.
4313,ACT IV.,
4314,ACT IV.,_Sar._                        What! more rebels?
4315,ACT IV.,"Let us be first, then."
4316,ACT IV.,
4317,ACT IV.,_Sal._                 That were hardly prudent                    550
4318,ACT IV.,"Now, though it was our first intention. If"
4319,ACT IV.,By noon to-morrow we are joined by those
4320,ACT IV.,"I've sent for by sure messengers, we shall be"
4321,ACT IV.,"In strength enough to venture an attack,"
4322,ACT IV.,"Aye, and pursuit too; but, till then, my voice"
4323,ACT IV.,Is to await the onset.
4324,ACT IV.,
4325,ACT IV.,_Sar._                 I detest
4326,ACT IV.,That waiting; though it seems so safe to fight
4327,ACT IV.,"Behind high walls, and hurl down foes into"
4328,ACT IV.,"Deep fosses, or behold them sprawl on spikes"
4329,ACT IV.,"Strewed to receive them, still I like it not--                     560"
4330,ACT IV.,"My soul seems lukewarm; but when I set on them,"
4331,ACT IV.,"Though they were piled on mountains, I would have"
4332,ACT IV.,"A pluck at them, or perish in hot blood!--"
4333,ACT IV.,Let me then charge.
4334,ACT IV.,
4335,ACT IV.,_Sal._ You talk like a young soldier.
4336,ACT IV.,
4337,ACT IV.,"_Sar._ I am no soldier, but a man: speak not"
4338,ACT IV.,"Of soldiership, I loathe the word, and those"
4339,ACT IV.,Who pride themselves upon it; but direct me
4340,ACT IV.,Where I may pour upon them.
4341,ACT IV.,
4342,ACT IV.,_Sal._                     You must spare
4343,ACT IV.,To expose your life too hastily; 'tis not
4344,ACT IV.,Like mine or any other subject's breath:                           570
4345,ACT IV.,The whole war turns upon it--with it; this
4346,ACT IV.,"Alone creates it, kindles, and may quench it--"
4347,ACT IV.,Prolong it--end it.
4348,ACT IV.,
4349,ACT IV.,_Sar._             Then let us end both!
4350,ACT IV.,"'Twere better thus, perhaps, than prolong either;"
4351,ACT IV.,"I'm sick of one, perchance of both."
4352,ACT IV.,[_A trumpet sounds without_.
4353,ACT IV.,
4354,ACT IV.,_Sal._                             Hark!
4355,ACT IV.,
4356,ACT IV.,_Sar._                                  Let us
4357,ACT IV.,"Reply, not listen."
4358,ACT IV.,
4359,ACT IV.,_Sal._             And your wound!
4360,ACT IV.,
4361,ACT IV.,_Sar._                            'Tis bound--
4362,ACT IV.,'Tis healed--I had forgotten it. Away!
4363,ACT IV.,A leech's lancet would have scratched me deeper;[ak]
4364,ACT IV.,The slave that gave it might be well ashamed
4365,ACT IV.,To have struck so weakly.
4366,ACT IV.,
4367,ACT IV.,"_Sal._                   Now, may none this hour                   580"
4368,ACT IV.,Strike with a better aim!
4369,ACT IV.,
4370,ACT IV.,"_Sar._                    Aye, if we conquer;"
4371,ACT IV.,"But if not, they will only leave to me"
4372,ACT IV.,A task they might have spared their king. Upon them!
4373,ACT IV.,[_Trumpet sounds again_.
4374,ACT IV.,
4375,ACT IV.,_Sal._ I am with you.
4376,ACT IV.,
4377,ACT IV.,"_Sar._               Ho, my arms! again, my arms!"
4378,ACT IV.,[_Exeunt_.
4379,ACT IV.,
4380,ACT IV.,
4381,ACT IV.,
4382,ACT IV.,
4383,ACT V.,ACT V.
4384,ACT V.,
4385,ACT V.,SCENE I.-_The same Hall in the Palace_.
4386,ACT V.,
4387,ACT V.,MYRRHA _and_ BALEA.
4388,ACT V.,
4389,ACT V.,_Myr._ (_at a window_)[28]
4390,ACT V.,The day at last has broken. What a night
4391,ACT V.,Hath ushered it! How beautiful in heaven!
4392,ACT V.,"Though varied with a transitory storm,"
4393,ACT V.,More beautiful in that variety!
4394,ACT V.,"How hideous upon earth! where Peace and Hope,"
4395,ACT V.,"And Love and Revel, in an hour were trampled"
4396,ACT V.,"By human passions to a human chaos,"
4397,ACT V.,Not yet resolved to separate elements--
4398,ACT V.,"'Tis warring still! And can the sun so rise,"
4399,ACT V.,"So bright, so rolling back the clouds into                          10"
4400,ACT V.,"Vapours more lovely than the unclouded sky,"
4401,ACT V.,"With golden pinnacles, and snowy mountains,"
4402,ACT V.,"And billows purpler than the Ocean's, making"
4403,ACT V.,"In heaven a glorious mockery of the earth,"
4404,ACT V.,So like we almost deem it permanent;
4405,ACT V.,"So fleeting, we can scarcely call it aught"
4406,ACT V.,"Beyond a vision, 'tis so transiently"
4407,ACT V.,Scattered along the eternal vault: and yet
4408,ACT V.,"It dwells upon the soul, and soothes the soul,"
4409,ACT V.,"And blends itself into the soul, until                              20"
4410,ACT V.,Sunrise and sunset form the haunted epoch
4411,ACT V.,"Of Sorrow and of Love; which they who mark not,"
4412,ACT V.,Know not the realms where those twin genii[al]
4413,ACT V.,"(Who chasten and who purify our hearts,"
4414,ACT V.,So that we would not change their sweet rebukes
4415,ACT V.,For all the boisterous joys that ever shook
4416,ACT V.,The air with clamour) build the palaces
4417,ACT V.,Where their fond votaries repose and breathe
4418,ACT V.,Briefly;--but in that brief cool calm inhale
4419,ACT V.,Enough of heaven to enable them to bear                             30
4420,ACT V.,"The rest of common, heavy, human hours,"
4421,ACT V.,"And dream them through in placid sufferance,"
4422,ACT V.,Though seemingly employed like all the rest
4423,ACT V.,Of toiling breathers in allotted tasks[am]
4424,ACT V.,"Of pain or pleasure, _two_ names for _one_ feeling,"
4425,ACT V.,"Which our internal, restless agony"
4426,ACT V.,"Would vary in the sound, although the sense"
4427,ACT V.,Escapes our highest efforts to be happy.
4428,ACT V.,
4429,ACT V.,_Bal._ You muse right calmly: and can you so watch
4430,ACT V.,The sunrise which may be our last?
4431,ACT V.,
4432,ACT V.,_Myr._                             It is                            40
4433,ACT V.,"Therefore that I so watch it, and reproach"
4434,ACT V.,"Those eyes, which never may behold it more,"
4435,ACT V.,"For having looked upon it oft, too oft,"
4436,ACT V.,Without the reverence and the rapture due
4437,ACT V.,To that which keeps all earth from being as fragile
4438,ACT V.,"As I am in this form. Come, look upon it,"
4439,ACT V.,"The Chaldee's God, which, when I gaze upon,"
4440,ACT V.,I grow almost a convert to your Baal.
4441,ACT V.,
4442,ACT V.,"_Bal._ As now he reigns in heaven, so once on earth"
4443,ACT V.,He swayed.
4444,ACT V.,
4445,ACT V.,"_Myr._    He sways it now far more, then; never                     50"
4446,ACT V.,Had earthly monarch half the power and glory
4447,ACT V.,Which centres in a single ray of his.
4448,ACT V.,
4449,ACT V.,_Bal._ Surely he is a God!
4450,ACT V.,
4451,ACT V.,_Myr._                      So we Greeks deem too;
4452,ACT V.,And yet I sometimes think that gorgeous orb
4453,ACT V.,Must rather be the abode of Gods than one
4454,ACT V.,Of the immortal sovereigns. Now he breaks
4455,ACT V.,"Through all the clouds, and fills my eyes with light"
4456,ACT V.,That shuts the world out. I can look no more.
4457,ACT V.,
4458,ACT V.,_Bal._ Hark! heard you not a sound?
4459,ACT V.,
4460,ACT V.,"_Myr._                            No, 'twas mere fancy;"
4461,ACT V.,"They battle it beyond the wall, and not                             60"
4462,ACT V.,As in late midnight conflict in the very
4463,ACT V.,Chambers: the palace has become a fortress
4464,ACT V.,"Since that insidious hour; and here, within"
4465,ACT V.,"The very centre, girded by vast courts"
4466,ACT V.,"And regal halls of pyramid proportions,"
4467,ACT V.,Which must be carried one by one before
4468,ACT V.,"They penetrate to where they then arrived,"
4469,ACT V.,We are as much shut in even from the sound
4470,ACT V.,Of peril as from glory.
4471,ACT V.,
4472,ACT V.,_Bal._                  But they reached
4473,ACT V.,Thus far before.
4474,ACT V.,
4475,ACT V.,"_Myr._           Yes, by surprise, and were                         70"
4476,ACT V.,Beat back by valour: now at once we have
4477,ACT V.,Courage and vigilance to guard us.
4478,ACT V.,
4479,ACT V.,_Bal._                              May they
4480,ACT V.,Prosper!
4481,ACT V.,
4482,ACT V.,"_Myr._    That is the prayer of many, and"
4483,ACT V.,The dread of more: it is an anxious hour;
4484,ACT V.,I strive to keep it from my thoughts. Alas!
4485,ACT V.,How vainly!
4486,ACT V.,
4487,ACT V.,_Bal._      It is said the King's demeanour
4488,ACT V.,In the late action scarcely more appalled
4489,ACT V.,The rebels than astonished his true subjects.
4490,ACT V.,
4491,ACT V.,_Myr._ 'Tis easy to astonish or appal
4492,ACT V.,The vulgar mass which moulds a horde of slaves;                     80
4493,ACT V.,But he did bravely.
4494,ACT V.,
4495,ACT V.,_Bal._              Slew he not Beleses?
4496,ACT V.,I heard the soldiers say he struck him down.
4497,ACT V.,
4498,ACT V.,"_Myr._ The wretch was overthrown, but rescued to"
4499,ACT V.,"Triumph, perhaps, o'er one who vanquished him"
4500,ACT V.,"In fight, as he had spared him in his peril;"
4501,ACT V.,And by that heedless pity risked a crown.
4502,ACT V.,
4503,ACT V.,_Bal._                                    Hark!
4504,ACT V.,
4505,ACT V.,"_Myr._ You are right; some steps approach, but slowly."
4506,ACT V.,
4507,ACT V.,"_Enter Soldiers, bearing in_ SALEMENES _wounded, with"
4508,ACT V.,a broken javelin in his side: they seat him upon one of
4509,ACT V.,the couches which furnish the Apartment_.
4510,ACT V.,
4511,ACT V.,"_Myr._ Oh, Jove!"
4512,ACT V.,
4513,ACT V.,_Bal._            Then all is over.
4514,ACT V.,
4515,ACT V.,_Sal._                              That is false.
4516,ACT V.,"Hew down the slave who says so, if a soldier."
4517,ACT V.,
4518,ACT V.,"_Myr._ Spare him--he's none: a mere court butterfly,                90"
4519,ACT V.,That flutter in the pageant of a monarch.
4520,ACT V.,
4521,ACT V.,"_Sal._ Let him live on, then."
4522,ACT V.,
4523,ACT V.,"_Myr._                       So wilt thou, I trust."
4524,ACT V.,
4525,ACT V.,"_Sal._ I fain would live this hour out, and the event,"
4526,ACT V.,But doubt it. Wherefore did ye bear me here?
4527,ACT V.,
4528,ACT V.,"_Sol._ By the King's order. When the javelin struck you,"
4529,ACT V.,You fell and fainted: 'twas his strict command
4530,ACT V.,To bear you to this hall.
4531,ACT V.,
4532,ACT V.,_Sal._                    'Twas not ill done:
4533,ACT V.,"For seeming slain in that cold dizzy trance,"
4534,ACT V.,"The sight might shake our soldiers--but--'tis vain,"
4535,ACT V.,I feel it ebbing!
4536,ACT V.,
4537,ACT V.,_Myr._            Let me see the wound;                            100
4538,ACT V.,I am not quite skilless: in my native land
4539,ACT V.,"'Tis part of our instruction. War being constant,"
4540,ACT V.,We are nerved to look on such things.[an]
4541,ACT V.,
4542,ACT V.,_Sol._                               Best extract
4543,ACT V.,The javelin.
4544,ACT V.,
4545,ACT V.,"_Myr._       Hold! no, no, it cannot be."
4546,ACT V.,
4547,ACT V.,"_Sal._ I am sped, then!"
4548,ACT V.,
4549,ACT V.,_Myr._                   With the blood that fast must follow
4550,ACT V.,"The extracted weapon, I do fear thy life."
4551,ACT V.,
4552,ACT V.,_Sal._ And I _not_ death. Where was the King when you
4553,ACT V.,Conveyed me from the spot where I was stricken?
4554,ACT V.,
4555,ACT V.,"_Sol._ Upon the same ground, and encouraging"
4556,ACT V.,With voice and gesture the dispirited troops                       110
4557,ACT V.,"Who had seen you fall, and faltered back."
4558,ACT V.,
4559,ACT V.,_Sal._                                    Whom heard ye
4560,ACT V.,Named next to the command?
4561,ACT V.,
4562,ACT V.,_Sol._                     I did not hear.
4563,ACT V.,
4564,ACT V.,"_Sal._ Fly, then, and tell him, 'twas my last request"
4565,ACT V.,"That Zames take my post until the junction,"
4566,ACT V.,"So hoped for, yet delayed, of Ofratanes,"
4567,ACT V.,Satrap of Susa. Leave me here: our troops
4568,ACT V.,Are not so numerous as to spare your absence.
4569,ACT V.,
4570,ACT V.,_Sol._ But Prince----
4571,ACT V.,
4572,ACT V.,"_Sal._               Hence, I say! Here's a courtier and"
4573,ACT V.,"A woman, the best chamber company."
4574,ACT V.,As you would not permit me to expire                               120
4575,ACT V.,"Upon the field, I'll have no idle soldiers"
4576,ACT V.,About my sick couch. Hence! and do my bidding!
4577,ACT V.,[_Exeunt the Soldiers_.
4578,ACT V.,
4579,ACT V.,_Myr._ Gallant and glorious Spirit! must the earth
4580,ACT V.,So soon resign thee?
4581,ACT V.,
4582,ACT V.,"_Sal._               Gentle Myrrha, 'tis"
4583,ACT V.,"The end I would have chosen, had I saved"
4584,ACT V.,The monarch or the monarchy by this;
4585,ACT V.,"As 'tis, I have not outlived them."
4586,ACT V.,
4587,ACT V.,_Myr._                             You wax paler.
4588,ACT V.,
4589,ACT V.,_Sal._ Your hand; this broken weapon but prolongs
4590,ACT V.,"My pangs, without sustaining life enough"
4591,ACT V.,To make me useful: I would draw it forth                           130
4592,ACT V.,"And my life with it, could I but hear how"
4593,ACT V.,The fight goes.
4594,ACT V.,
4595,ACT V.,_Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and Soldiers_.
4596,ACT V.,
4597,ACT V.,_Sar._         My best brother!
4598,ACT V.,
4599,ACT V.,_Sal._                          And the battle
4600,ACT V.,Is lost?
4601,ACT V.,
4602,ACT V.,_Sar._ (_despondingly_). You see _me here_.
4603,ACT V.,
4604,ACT V.,_Sal._                                    I'd rather see you _thus!_
4605,ACT V.,"[_He draws out the weapon from the wound, and dies_."
4606,ACT V.,
4607,ACT V.,"_Sar._ And _thus_ I will be seen; unless the succour,"
4608,ACT V.,"The last frail reed of our beleagured hopes,"
4609,ACT V.,Arrive with Ofratanes.
4610,ACT V.,
4611,ACT V.,_Myr._                 Did you not
4612,ACT V.,"Receive a token from your dying brother,"
4613,ACT V.,Appointing Zames chief?
4614,ACT V.,
4615,ACT V.,_Sar._                  I did.
4616,ACT V.,
4617,ACT V.,_Myr._                        Where's Zames?
4618,ACT V.,
4619,ACT V.,_Sar._ Dead.
4620,ACT V.,
4621,ACT V.,_Myr._       And Altada?
4622,ACT V.,
4623,ACT V.,_Sar._                   Dying.
4624,ACT V.,
4625,ACT V.,_Myr._                          Pania? Sfero?
4626,ACT V.,
4627,ACT V.,_Sar._ Pania yet lives; but Sfero's fled or captive.               140
4628,ACT V.,I am alone.
4629,ACT V.,
4630,ACT V.,_Myr._      And is all lost?
4631,ACT V.,
4632,ACT V.,"_Sar._                      Our walls,"
4633,ACT V.,"Though thinly manned, may still hold out against"
4634,ACT V.,"Their present force, or aught save treachery:"
4635,ACT V.,But i' the field----
4636,ACT V.,
4637,ACT V.,_Myr._                I thought 'twas the intent
4638,ACT V.,Of Salemenes not to risk a sally
4639,ACT V.,Till ye were strengthened by the expected succours.
4640,ACT V.,
4641,ACT V.,_Sar._ _I_ over-ruled him.
4642,ACT V.,
4643,ACT V.,"_Myr._                   Well, the _fault's_ a brave one."
4644,ACT V.,
4645,ACT V.,"_Sar._ But fatal. Oh, my brother! I would give"
4646,ACT V.,"These realms, of which thou wert the ornament,"
4647,ACT V.,"The sword and shield, the sole-redeeming honour,                   150"
4648,ACT V.,To call back----But I will not weep for thee;
4649,ACT V.,Thou shall be mourned for as thou wouldst be mourned.
4650,ACT V.,It grieves me most that thou couldst quit this life
4651,ACT V.,Believing that I could survive what thou
4652,ACT V.,Hast died for--our long royalty of race.
4653,ACT V.,"If I redeem it, I will give thee blood"
4654,ACT V.,"Of thousands, tears of millions, for atonement,"
4655,ACT V.,(The tears of all the good are thine already).
4656,ACT V.,"If not, we meet again soon,--if the spirit"
4657,ACT V.,"Within us lives beyond:--thou readest mine,                        160"
4658,ACT V.,And dost me justice now. Let me once clasp
4659,ACT V.,"That yet warm hand, and fold that throbless heart"
4660,ACT V.,[_Embraces the body_.
4661,ACT V.,"To this which beats so bitterly. Now, bear"
4662,ACT V.,The body hence.
4663,ACT V.,
4664,ACT V.,_Sol._          Where?
4665,ACT V.,
4666,ACT V.,_Sar._              To my proper chamber.
4667,ACT V.,"Place it beneath my canopy, as though"
4668,ACT V.,"The King lay there: when this is done, we will"
4669,ACT V.,Speak further of the rites due to such ashes.
4670,ACT V.,[_Exeunt Soldiers with the body of_ SALEMENES.
4671,ACT V.,
4672,ACT V.,_Enter_ PANIA.
4673,ACT V.,
4674,ACT V.,"_Sar._ Well, Pania! have you placed the guards, and issued"
4675,ACT V.,The orders fixed on?
4676,ACT V.,
4677,ACT V.,"_Pan._              Sire, I have obeyed."
4678,ACT V.,
4679,ACT V.,_Sar._ And do the soldiers keep their hearts up?
4680,ACT V.,
4681,ACT V.,_Pan._                                            Sire?            170
4682,ACT V.,
4683,ACT V.,"_Sar._ I am answered! When a king asks twice, and has"
4684,ACT V.,"A question as an answer to _his_ question,"
4685,ACT V.,It is a portent. What! they are disheartened?
4686,ACT V.,
4687,ACT V.,"_Pan._ The death of Salemenes, and the shouts"
4688,ACT V.,"Of the exulting rebels on his fall,"
4689,ACT V.,Have made them----
4690,ACT V.,
4691,ACT V.,_Sar._           _Rage_--not droop--it should have been.
4692,ACT V.,We'll find the means to rouse them.
4693,ACT V.,
4694,ACT V.,_Pan._                              Such a loss
4695,ACT V.,Might sadden even a victory.
4696,ACT V.,
4697,ACT V.,_Sar._                       Alas!
4698,ACT V.,"Who can so feel it as I feel? but yet,"
4699,ACT V.,"Though cooped within these walls, they are strong, and we          180"
4700,ACT V.,"Have those without will break their way through hosts,"
4701,ACT V.,To make their sovereign's dwelling what it was--
4702,ACT V.,"A palace, not a prison--nor a fortress."
4703,ACT V.,
4704,ACT V.,"_Enter an Officer, hastily_."
4705,ACT V.,
4706,ACT V.,_Sar._ Thy face seems ominous. Speak!
4707,ACT V.,
4708,ACT V.,_Offi._                               I dare not.
4709,ACT V.,
4710,ACT V.,_Sar._                                           Dare not?
4711,ACT V.,While millions dare revolt with sword in hand!
4712,ACT V.,That's strange. I pray thee break that loyal silence
4713,ACT V.,Which loathes to shock its sovereign; we can hear
4714,ACT V.,Worse than thou hast to tell.
4715,ACT V.,
4716,ACT V.,_Pan._                        Proceed--thou hearest.
4717,ACT V.,
4718,ACT V.,_Offi._ The wall which skirted near the river's brink
4719,ACT V.,Is thrown down by the sudden inundation                            190
4720,ACT V.,"Of the Euphrates, which now rolling, swoln"
4721,ACT V.,"From the enormous mountains where it rises,"
4722,ACT V.,"By the late rains of that tempestuous region,"
4723,ACT V.,"O'erfloods its banks, and hath destroyed the bulwark."
4724,ACT V.,
4725,ACT V.,_Pan._ That's a black augury! it has been said
4726,ACT V.,"For ages, ""That the City ne'er should yield"
4727,ACT V.,"To man, until the River grew its foe."""
4728,ACT V.,
4729,ACT V.,"_Sar._ I can forgive the omen, not the ravage."
4730,ACT V.,How much is swept down of the wall?
4731,ACT V.,
4732,ACT V.,_Offi._                             About
4733,ACT V.,Some twenty stadia.[29]
4734,ACT V.,
4735,ACT V.,_Sar._              And all this is left                          200
4736,ACT V.,Pervious to the assailants?
4737,ACT V.,
4738,ACT V.,_Offi._                     For the present
4739,ACT V.,The River's fury must impede the assault;
4740,ACT V.,"But when he shrinks into his wonted channel,"
4741,ACT V.,"And may be crossed by the accustomed barks,"
4742,ACT V.,The palace is their own.
4743,ACT V.,
4744,ACT V.,_Sar._                   That shall be never.
4745,ACT V.,"Though men, and gods, and elements, and omens,"
4746,ACT V.,"Have risen up 'gainst one who ne'er provoked them,"
4747,ACT V.,My father's house shall never be a cave
4748,ACT V.,For wolves to horde and howl in.
4749,ACT V.,
4750,ACT V.,"_Pan._                           With your sanction,"
4751,ACT V.,"I will proceed to the spot, and take such measures                 210"
4752,ACT V.,For the assurance of the vacant space
4753,ACT V.,As time and means permit.
4754,ACT V.,
4755,ACT V.,"_Sar._                    About it straight,"
4756,ACT V.,"And bring me back, as speedily as full"
4757,ACT V.,"And fair investigation may permit,"
4758,ACT V.,Report of the true state of this irruption
4759,ACT V.,Of waters.                          [_Exeunt_ PANIA _and the Officer_.
4760,ACT V.,
4761,ACT V.,_Myr._    Thus the very waves rise up
4762,ACT V.,Against you.
4763,ACT V.,
4764,ACT V.,"_Sar._      They are not my subjects, girl,"
4765,ACT V.,"And may be pardoned, since they can't be punished."
4766,ACT V.,
4767,ACT V.,_Myr._ I joy to see this portent shakes you not.
4768,ACT V.,
4769,ACT V.,_Sar._ I am past the fear of portents: they can tell me            220
4770,ACT V.,Nothing I have not told myself since midnight:
4771,ACT V.,Despair anticipates such things.
4772,ACT V.,
4773,ACT V.,_Myr._                           Despair!
4774,ACT V.,
4775,ACT V.,_Sar._ No; not despair precisely. When we know
4776,ACT V.,"All that can come, and how to meet it, our"
4777,ACT V.,"Resolves, if firm, may merit a more noble"
4778,ACT V.,Word than this is to give it utterance.
4779,ACT V.,But what are words to us? we have well nigh done
4780,ACT V.,With them and all things.
4781,ACT V.,
4782,ACT V.,_Myr._                    Save _one deed_--the last
4783,ACT V.,And greatest to all mortals; crowning act
4784,ACT V.,"Of all that was, or is, or is to be--                              230"
4785,ACT V.,"The only thing common to all mankind,"
4786,ACT V.,"So different in their births, tongues, sexes, natures,"
4787,ACT V.,"Hues, features, climes, times, feelings, intellects,[ao]"
4788,ACT V.,Without one point of union save in this--
4789,ACT V.,"To which we tend, for which we're born, and thread"
4790,ACT V.,"The labyrinth of mystery, called life."
4791,ACT V.,
4792,ACT V.,"_Sar._ Our clue being well nigh wound out, let's be cheerful."
4793,ACT V.,They who have nothing more to fear may well
4794,ACT V.,Indulge a smile at that which once appalled;
4795,ACT V.,As children at discovered bugbears.
4796,ACT V.,
4797,ACT V.,_Re-enter_ PANIA.
4798,ACT V.,
4799,ACT V.,_Pan._                              'Tis                           240
4800,ACT V.,As was reported: I have ordered there
4801,ACT V.,"A double guard, withdrawing from the wall,"
4802,ACT V.,"Where it was strongest, the required addition"
4803,ACT V.,To watch the breach occasioned by the waters.
4804,ACT V.,
4805,ACT V.,"_Sar._ You have done your duty faithfully, and as"
4806,ACT V.,My worthy Pania! further ties between us
4807,ACT V.,Draw near a close--I pray you take this key:
4808,ACT V.,[_Gives a key_.
4809,ACT V.,"It opens to a secret chamber, placed"
4810,ACT V.,Behind the couch in my own chamber--(Now
4811,ACT V.,Pressed by a nobler weight than e'er it bore--                     250
4812,ACT V.,Though a long line of sovereigns have lain down
4813,ACT V.,Along its golden frame--as bearing for
4814,ACT V.,A time what late was Salemenes.)--Search
4815,ACT V.,The secret covert to which this will lead you;
4816,ACT V.,'Tis full of treasure;[30] take it for yourself
4817,ACT V.,"And your companions:[ap] there's enough to load ye,"
4818,ACT V.,"Though ye be many. Let the slaves be freed, too;"
4819,ACT V.,"And all the inmates of the palace, of"
4820,ACT V.,"Whatever sex, now quit it in an hour."
4821,ACT V.,"Thence launch the regal barks, once formed for pleasure,           260"
4822,ACT V.,"And now to serve for safety, and embark."
4823,ACT V.,"The river's broad and swoln, and uncommanded,"
4824,ACT V.,(More potent than a king) by these besiegers.
4825,ACT V.,Fly! and be happy!
4826,ACT V.,
4827,ACT V.,_Pan._             Under your protection!
4828,ACT V.,So you accompany your faithful guard.
4829,ACT V.,
4830,ACT V.,"_Sar._ No, Pania! that must not be; get thee hence,"
4831,ACT V.,And leave me to my fate.
4832,ACT V.,
4833,ACT V.,_Pan._                   'Tis the first time
4834,ACT V.,I ever disobeyed: but now----
4835,ACT V.,
4836,ACT V.,_Sar._                      So all men
4837,ACT V.,"Dare beard me now, and Insolence within"
4838,ACT V.,Apes Treason from without. Question no further;                    270
4839,ACT V.,"'Tis my command, my last command. Wilt _thou_"
4840,ACT V.,Oppose it? _thou!_
4841,ACT V.,
4842,ACT V.,_Pan._              But yet--not yet.
4843,ACT V.,
4844,ACT V.,"_Sar._                               Well, then,"
4845,ACT V.,Swear that you will obey when I shall give
4846,ACT V.,The signal.
4847,ACT V.,
4848,ACT V.,"_Pan._     With a heavy but true heart,"
4849,ACT V.,I promise.
4850,ACT V.,
4851,ACT V.,_Sar._      'Tis enough. Now order here
4852,ACT V.,"Faggots, pine-nuts, and withered leaves, and such"
4853,ACT V.,Things as catch fire and blaze with one sole spark;
4854,ACT V.,"Bring cedar, too, and precious drugs, and spices,"

4861,ACT V.,
4862,ACT V.,"_Sar._                                   I have said it,"
4863,ACT V.,And _you_ have sworn.
4864,ACT V.,
4865,ACT V.,_Pan._               And could keep my faith

4867,ACT V.,
4868,ACT V.,_Myr._        What mean you?
4869,ACT V.,
4870,ACT V.,_Sar._                      You shall know
4871,ACT V.,Anon--what the whole earth shall ne'er forget.
4872,ACT V.,
4873,ACT V.,"PANIA, _returning with a Herald_."
4874,ACT V.,
4875,ACT V.,"_Pan._ My King, in going forth upon my duty,"
4876,ACT V.,"This herald has been brought before me, craving"
4877,ACT V.,An audience.
4878,ACT V.,
4879,ACT V.,_Sar._      Let him speak.
4880,ACT V.,
4881,ACT V.,_Her._                     The _King_ Arbaces----
4882,ACT V.,
4883,ACT V.,"_Sar._ What, crowned already?--But, proceed."
4884,ACT V.,
4885,ACT V.,"_Her._                                       Beleses,"
4886,ACT V.,The anointed High-priest----
4887,ACT V.,
4888,ACT V.,_Sar._                      Of what god or demon?                  290
4889,ACT V.,"With new kings rise new altars. But, proceed;"
4890,ACT V.,"You are sent to prate your master's will, and not"
4891,ACT V.,Reply to mine.
4892,ACT V.,
4893,ACT V.,_Her._        And Satrap Ofratanes----
4894,ACT V.,
4895,ACT V.,"_Sar._ Why, _he_ is _ours_."
4896,ACT V.,
4897,ACT V.,_Her._ (_showing a ring_). Be sure that he is now
4898,ACT V.,In the camp of the conquerors; behold
4899,ACT V.,His signet ring.
4900,ACT V.,
4901,ACT V.,_Sar._          'Tis his. A worthy triad!
4902,ACT V.,Poor Salemenes! thou hast died in time
4903,ACT V.,To see one treachery the less: this man
4904,ACT V.,Was thy true friend and my most trusted subject.
4905,ACT V.,Proceed.
4906,ACT V.,
4907,ACT V.,"_Her._   They offer thee thy life, and freedom                     300"
4908,ACT V.,Of choice to single out a residence
4909,ACT V.,"In any of the further provinces,"
4910,ACT V.,"Guarded and watched, but not confined in person,"
4911,ACT V.,Where thou shalt pass thy days in peace; but on
4912,ACT V.,Condition that the three young princes are
4913,ACT V.,Given up as hostages.
4914,ACT V.,
4915,ACT V.,_Sar._ (_ironically_). The generous Victors!
4916,ACT V.,
4917,ACT V.,_Her._ I wait the answer.
4918,ACT V.,
4919,ACT V.,"_Sar._                    Answer, slave! How long"
4920,ACT V.,Have slaves decided on the doom of kings?
4921,ACT V.,
4922,ACT V.,_Her._ Since they were free.
4923,ACT V.,
4924,ACT V.,_Sar._                       Mouthpiece of mutiny!
4925,ACT V.,Thou at the least shalt learn the penalty                          310
4926,ACT V.,"Of treason, though its proxy only. Pania!"
4927,ACT V.,Let his head be thrown from our walls within
4928,ACT V.,"The rebels' lines, his carcass down the river."
4929,ACT V.,Away with him!                    [PANIA _and the Guards seizing him_.
4930,ACT V.,
4931,ACT V.,_Pan._        I never yet obeyed
4932,ACT V.,Your orders with more pleasure than the present.
4933,ACT V.,"Hence with him, soldiers! do not soil this hall"
4934,ACT V.,Of royalty with treasonable gore;
4935,ACT V.,Put him to rest without.
4936,ACT V.,
4937,ACT V.,_Her._                  A single word:
4938,ACT V.,"My office, King, is sacred."
4939,ACT V.,
4940,ACT V.,_Sar._                     And what's _mine_?
4941,ACT V.,That thou shouldst come and dare to ask of me                      320
4942,ACT V.,To lay it down?
4943,ACT V.,
4944,ACT V.,"_Her._         I but obeyed my orders,"
4945,ACT V.,"At the same peril if refused, as now"
4946,ACT V.,Incurred by my obedience.
4947,ACT V.,
4948,ACT V.,_Sar._                   So there are
4949,ACT V.,New monarchs of an hour's growth as despotic
4950,ACT V.,"As sovereigns swathed in purple, and enthroned"
4951,ACT V.,From birth to manhood!
4952,ACT V.,
4953,ACT V.,_Her._                My life waits your breath.
4954,ACT V.,Yours (I speak humbly)--but it may be--yours
4955,ACT V.,May also be in danger scarce less imminent:
4956,ACT V.,Would it then suit the last hours of a line
4957,ACT V.,"Such as is that of Nimrod, to destroy                              330"
4958,ACT V.,"A peaceful herald, unarmed, in his office;"
4959,ACT V.,And violate not only all that man
4960,ACT V.,Holds sacred between man and man--but that
4961,ACT V.,More holy tie which links us with the Gods?
4962,ACT V.,
4963,ACT V.,_Sar._ He's right.--Let him go free.--My life's last act
4964,ACT V.,"Shall not be one of wrath. Here, fellow, take"
4965,ACT V.,[_Gives him a golden cup from a table near_.
4966,ACT V.,"This golden goblet, let it hold your wine,"
4967,ACT V.,"And think of _me_; or melt it into ingots,"
4968,ACT V.,And think of nothing but their weight and value.
4969,ACT V.,
4970,ACT V.,"_Her._ I thank you doubly for my life, and this                    340"
4971,ACT V.,"Most gorgeous gift, which renders it more precious."
4972,ACT V.,But must I bear no answer?
4973,ACT V.,
4974,ACT V.,"_Sar._                    Yes,--I ask"
4975,ACT V.,An hour's truce to consider.
4976,ACT V.,
4977,ACT V.,_Her._                      But an hour's?
4978,ACT V.,
4979,ACT V.,_Sar._ An hour's: if at the expiration of
4980,ACT V.,"That time your masters hear no further from me,"
4981,ACT V.,"They are to deem that I reject their terms,"
4982,ACT V.,And act befittingly.
4983,ACT V.,
4984,ACT V.,_Her._              I shall not fail
4985,ACT V.,To be a faithful legate of your pleasure.
4986,ACT V.,
4987,ACT V.,_Sar._ And hark! a word more.
4988,ACT V.,
4989,ACT V.,"_Her._                        I shall not forget it,"
4990,ACT V.,Whate'er it be.
4991,ACT V.,
4992,ACT V.,_Sar._         Commend me to Beleses;                              350
4993,ACT V.,"And tell him, ere a year expire, I summon"
4994,ACT V.,Him hence to meet me.
4995,ACT V.,
4996,ACT V.,_Her._               Where?
4997,ACT V.,
4998,ACT V.,_Sar._                     At Babylon.
4999,ACT V.,At least from thence he will depart to meet me.
5000,ACT V.,
5001,ACT V.,_Her._ I shall obey you to the letter.                 [_Exit Herald_.
5002,ACT V.,
5003,ACT V.,_Sar._                                Pania!--
5004,ACT V.,"Now, my good Pania!--quick--with what I ordered."
5005,ACT V.,
5006,ACT V.,"_Pan._ My Lord,--the soldiers are already charged."
5007,ACT V.,And see! they enter.
5008,ACT V.,
5009,ACT V.,"_Soldiers enter, and form a Pile about the Throne, etc._[31]"
5010,ACT V.,
5011,ACT V.,"_Sar._             Higher, my good soldiers,"
5012,ACT V.,And thicker yet; and see that the foundation
5013,ACT V.,Be such as will not speedily exhaust
5014,ACT V.,Its own too subtle flame; nor yet be quenched                      360
5015,ACT V.,With aught officious aid would bring to quell it.
5016,ACT V.,Let the throne form the _core_ of it; I would not
5017,ACT V.,"Leave that, save fraught with fire unquenchable,"
5018,ACT V.,To the new comers. Frame the whole as if
5019,ACT V.,'Twere to enkindle the strong tower of our
5020,ACT V.,Inveterate enemies. Now it bears an aspect!
5021,ACT V.,"How say you, Pania, will this pile suffice"
5022,ACT V.,For a King's obsequies?
5023,ACT V.,
5024,ACT V.,"_Pan._                 Aye, for a kingdom's."
5025,ACT V.,"I understand you, now."
5026,ACT V.,
5027,ACT V.,_Sar._                And blame me?
5028,ACT V.,
5029,ACT V.,_Pan._                             No--
5030,ACT V.,"Let me but fire the pile, and share it with you.                   370"
5031,ACT V.,
5032,ACT V.,_Myr._ That _duty's_ mine.
5033,ACT V.,
5034,ACT V.,_Pan._                    A woman's!
5035,ACT V.,
5036,ACT V.,_Myr._                              'Tis the soldier's
5037,ACT V.,"Part to die _for_ his sovereign, and why not"
5038,ACT V.,The woman's with her lover?
5039,ACT V.,
5040,ACT V.,_Pan._                     'Tis most strange!
5041,ACT V.,
5042,ACT V.,"_Myr._ But not so rare, my Pania, as thou think'st it."
5043,ACT V.,"In the mean time, live thou.--Farewell! the pile"
5044,ACT V.,Is ready.
5045,ACT V.,
5046,ACT V.,_Pan._     I should shame to leave my sovereign
5047,ACT V.,With but a single female to partake
5048,ACT V.,His death.
5049,ACT V.,
5050,ACT V.,_Sar._     Too many far have heralded
5051,ACT V.,Me to the dust already. Get thee hence;
5052,ACT V.,Enrich thee.
5053,ACT V.,
5054,ACT V.,_Pan._      And live wretched!
5055,ACT V.,
5056,ACT V.,_Sar._                        Think upon                           380
5057,ACT V.,Thy vow:--'tis sacred and irrevocable.
5058,ACT V.,
5059,ACT V.,"_Pan._ Since it is so, farewell."
5060,ACT V.,
5061,ACT V.,"_Sar._                            Search well my chamber,"
5062,ACT V.,Feel no remorse at bearing off the gold;
5063,ACT V.,"Remember, what you leave you leave the slaves"
5064,ACT V.,Who slew me: and when you have borne away
5065,ACT V.,"All safe off to your boats, blow one long blast"
5066,ACT V.,Upon the trumpet as you quit the palace.
5067,ACT V.,"The river's brink is too remote, its stream"
5068,ACT V.,Too loud at present to permit the echo
5069,ACT V.,"To reach distinctly from its banks. Then fly,--                    390"
5070,ACT V.,"And as you sail, turn back; but still keep on"
5071,ACT V.,Your way along the Euphrates: if you reach
5072,ACT V.,"The land of Paphlagonia, where the Queen"
5073,ACT V.,"Is safe with my three sons in Cotta's court,"
5074,ACT V.,"Say what you _saw_ at parting, and request"
5075,ACT V.,That she remember what I _said_ at one
5076,ACT V.,Parting more mournful still.
5077,ACT V.,
5078,ACT V.,_Pan._                      That royal hand!
5079,ACT V.,Let me then once more press it to my lips;
5080,ACT V.,"And these poor soldiers who throng round you, and"
5081,ACT V.,Would fain die with you!
5082,ACT V.,
5083,ACT V.,"[_The Soldiers and_ PANIA _throng round him,"
5084,ACT V.,kissing his hand and the hem of his robe_.
5085,ACT V.,
5086,ACT V.,_Sar._                    My best! my last friends!                400
5087,ACT V.,Let's not unman each other: part at once:
5088,ACT V.,"All farewells should be sudden, when for ever,"
5089,ACT V.,"Else they make an eternity of moments,"
5090,ACT V.,And clog the last sad sands of life with tears.
5091,ACT V.,"Hence, and be happy: trust me, I am not"
5092,ACT V.,_Now_ to be pitied; or far more for what
5093,ACT V.,"Is past than present;--for the future, 'tis"
5094,ACT V.,"In the hands of the deities, if such"
5095,ACT V.,There be: I shall know soon. Farewell--Farewell.
5096,ACT V.,[_Exeunt_ PANIA _and Soldiers_.
5097,ACT V.,
5098,ACT V.,_Myr._ These men were honest: it is comfort still                  410
5099,ACT V.,That our last looks should be on loving faces.
5100,ACT V.,
5101,ACT V.,"_Sar._ And _lovely_ ones, my beautiful!--but hear me!"
5102,ACT V.,"If at this moment,--for we now are on"
5103,ACT V.,"The brink,--thou feel'st an inward shrinking from"
5104,ACT V.,"This leap through flame into the future, say it:"
5105,ACT V.,"I shall not love thee less; nay, perhaps more,"
5106,ACT V.,For yielding to thy nature: and there's time
5107,ACT V.,Yet for thee to escape hence.
5108,ACT V.,
5109,ACT V.,_Myr._                      Shall I light
5110,ACT V.,One of the torches which lie heaped beneath
5111,ACT V.,"The ever-burning lamp that burns without,                          420"
5112,ACT V.,"Before Baal's shrine, in the adjoining hall?"
5113,ACT V.,
5114,ACT V.,_Sar._ Do so. Is that thy answer?
5115,ACT V.,
5116,ACT V.,_Myr._                             Thou shalt see.
5117,ACT V.,[_Exit_ MYRRHA.
5118,ACT V.,
5119,ACT V.,"_Sar._ (_solus_). She's firm. My fathers! whom I will rejoin,"
5120,ACT V.,"It may be, purified by death from some"
5121,ACT V.,"Of the gross stains of too material being,"
5122,ACT V.,I would not leave your ancient first abode
5123,ACT V.,To the defilement of usurping bondmen;
5124,ACT V.,If I have not kept your inheritance
5125,ACT V.,"As ye bequeathed it, this bright part of it,"
5126,ACT V.,Your treasure--your abode--your sacred relics                      430
5127,ACT V.,"Of arms, and records--monuments, and spoils,"
5128,ACT V.,"In which _they_ would have revelled, I bear with me"
5129,ACT V.,"To you in that absorbing element,"
5130,ACT V.,Which most personifies the soul as leaving
5131,ACT V.,The least of matter unconsumed before
5132,ACT V.,Its fiery workings:--and the light of this
5133,ACT V.,Most royal of funereal pyres shall be[aq]
5134,ACT V.,"Not a mere pillar formed of cloud and flame,"
5135,ACT V.,"A beacon in the horizon for a day,"
5136,ACT V.,And then a mount of ashes--but a light[ar]                         440
5137,ACT V.,"To lesson ages, rebel nations, and"
5138,ACT V.,Voluptuous princes. Time shall quench full many
5139,ACT V.,"A people's records, and a hero's acts;"
5140,ACT V.,"Sweep empire after empire, like this first"
5141,ACT V.,"Of empires, into nothing; but even then"
5142,ACT V.,"Shall spare this deed of mine, and hold it up"
5143,ACT V.,"A problem few dare imitate, and none"
5144,ACT V.,"Despise--but, it may be, avoid the life"
5145,ACT V.,Which led to such a consummation.
5146,ACT V.,
5147,ACT V.,"MYRRHA _returns with a lighted Torch in one Hand,"
5148,ACT V.,and a Cup in the other_.

5150,ACT V.,_Myr._                           Lo!
5151,ACT V.,I've lit the lamp which lights us to the stars.                    450
5152,ACT V.,
5153,ACT V.,_Sar._ And the cup?
5154,ACT V.,
5155,ACT V.,_Myr._              'Tis my country's custom to
5156,ACT V.,Make a libation to the Gods.
5157,ACT V.,
5158,ACT V.,_Sar._                     And mine
5159,ACT V.,To make libations amongst men. I've not
5160,ACT V.,"Forgot the custom; and although alone,"
5161,ACT V.,Will drain one draught in memory of many
5162,ACT V.,A joyous banquet past.
5163,ACT V.,
5164,ACT V.,
5165,ACT V.,"[SARDANAPALUS _takes the cup, and after drinking"

5167,ACT V.,exclaims_--
5168,ACT V.,
5169,ACT V.,And this libation
5170,ACT V.,Is for the excellent Beleses.
5171,ACT V.,
5172,ACT V.,_Myr._                       Why
5173,ACT V.,Dwells thy mind rather upon that man's name
5174,ACT V.,Than on his mate's in villany?
5175,ACT V.,
5176,ACT V.,_Sar._                        The other
5177,ACT V.,"Is a mere soldier, a mere tool, a kind                             460"
5178,ACT V.,Of human sword in a friend's hand; the other
5179,ACT V.,Is master-mover of his warlike puppet;
5180,ACT V.,"But I dismiss them from my mind.--Yet pause,"
5181,ACT V.,"My Myrrha! dost thou truly follow me,"
5182,ACT V.,Freely and fearlessly?
5183,ACT V.,
5184,ACT V.,_Myr._                And dost thou think

5187,ACT V.,
5188,ACT V.,_Sar._                                Then
5189,ACT V.,We but await the signal.
5190,ACT V.,
5191,ACT V.,_Myr._                  It is long
5192,ACT V.,In sounding.
5193,ACT V.,
5194,ACT V.,"_Sar._      Now, farewell; one last embrace."
5195,ACT V.,
5196,ACT V.,"_Myr._ Embrace, but _not_ the last; there is one more.             470"
5197,ACT V.,
5198,ACT V.,"_Sar._ True, the commingling fire will mix our ashes."
5199,ACT V.,
5200,ACT V.,"_Myr._ And pure as is my love to thee, shall they,"
5201,ACT V.,"Purged from the dross of earth, and earthly passion,"
5202,ACT V.,Mix pale with thine. A single thought yet irks me.
5203,ACT V.,
5204,ACT V.,_Sar._ Say it.
5205,ACT V.,
5206,ACT V.,_Myr._         It is that no kind hand will gather
5207,ACT V.,The dust of both into one urn.
5208,ACT V.,
5209,ACT V.,_Sar._                     The better:
5210,ACT V.,Rather let them be borne abroad upon
5211,ACT V.,"The winds of heaven, and scattered into air,"

5875,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"Ten, supported by a giunta of ten, on their own authority and"

5879,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,that this sentence was never carried into effect. At the end of four
5880,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"months, thanks to the intervention of five members of the Ten, he was"
5881,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"removed from Trieste to Treviso, and, two years later (September 13,"
5882,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"1447), out of consideration to the Doge, who pleaded that the exile of"
5883,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,his only son prevented him from giving his whole heart and soul to the
5884,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"Republic, permitted to return to Venice. So ends the first chapter of"
5885,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"Jacopo's misadventures. He stands charged with unlawful, if not"
5886,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"criminal, appropriation of gifts and moneys. He had been punished, but"
5887,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"less than he deserved, and, for his father's sake, the sentence of exile"
5888,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,had been altogether remitted.
5889,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,
5890,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"Three years went by, and once again, January, 1451, a charge was"
5891,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"preferred against Jacopo Foscari, and on this occasion he was arrested"
5892,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,and brought before the Ten. He was accused of being implicated in the
5893,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"murder of Ermolao Donato, who was assassinated November 5, 1450, on"
5894,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"leaving the Ducal Palace, where he had been attending the Council of the"

5897,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,happening to accost a servant of Jacopo's who was loading a barge with
5898,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"wood, asked for the latest news from Venice, and got as answer, ""Donato"
5899,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"has been murdered!"" The possession of the news some hours before it had"
5900,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"been made public, and the fact that the newsmonger had been haunting"
5901,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"the purlieus of the Ducal Palace on the previous afternoon, enabled the"
5902,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"Ten to convict Jacopo. They alleged (Decree of X., March 26, 1451) that"
5903,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"other evidence (""_testificationes et scripturæ_"") was in their"
5904,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"possession, and they pointed to the prisoner's obstinate silence on the"
5905,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"rack--a silence unbroken save by ""several incantations and magic words"
5906,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"which fell from him,"" as a confirmation of his guilt. Moreover, it was"
5907,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"""for the advantage of the State from many points of view"" that convicted"
5908,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,and condemned he should be. The question of his innocence or guilt
5909,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,(complicated by the report or tradition that one Nicolò Erizzo confessed
5910,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,on his death-bed that he had assassinated Donato for reasons of his own)

5912,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"sums up against him. It may, however, be urged in favour of Jacopo that"
5913,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,the Ten did not produce or quote the _scripturæ et testificationes_
5914,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,which convinced them of his guilt; that they stopped short of the
5915,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"death-penalty, and pronounced a sentence inadequate to the crime; and,"
5916,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"lastly, that not many years before they had taken into consideration the"
5917,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"possibility and advisability of poisoning Filippo Visconti, an event"
5918,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"which would, no doubt, have been ""to the advantage of the State from"

5920,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,
5921,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"Innocent or guilty, he was sentenced to perpetual banishment to the city"
5922,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"of Candia, on the north coast of the island of Crete; and, guilty or"
5923,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"innocent, Jacopo was not the man to make the best of what remained to"
5924,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"him and submit to fate. Intrigue he must, and, five years later (June,"
5925,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"1456), a report reached Venice that papers had been found in his"
5926,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"possession, some relating to the Duke of Milan, calculated to excite"
5927,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"""nuovi scandali e disordini,"" and others in cypher, which the Ten"
5928,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,could not read. Over and above these papers there was direct evidence
5929,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"that Jacopo had written to the _Imperatore dei Turchi_, imploring him to"
5930,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,send his galley and take him away from Candia. Here was a fresh instance
5931,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"of treachery to the Republic, and, July 21, 1456, Jacopo returned to"
5932,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,Venice under the custody of Lorenzo Loredano.
5933,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,
5934,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"According to Romanin (_Storia, etc._, iv. 284), he was not put to the"

5951,INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_,"retired to his own apartments, and refused to preside at Councils of"

6517,ACT I.,"And yet they wrung me till I _could_ have shrieked,"

6545,ACT I.,I know that none who enter there return
6546,ACT I.,As they have entered--many never; but
6547,ACT I.,They shall not balk my entrance.
6548,ACT I.,
6549,ACT I.,_Mem._                          Alas! this
6550,ACT I.,"Is but to expose yourself to harsh repulse,"
6551,ACT I.,And worse suspense.

6561,ACT I.,The fiends who will one day requite them in
6562,ACT I.,Variety of torturing! Yet I'll pass.
6563,ACT I.,
6564,ACT I.,_Mem._ It is impossible.
6565,ACT I.,
6566,ACT I.,_Mar._                 That shall be tried.[ay]
6567,ACT I.,Despair defies even despotism: there is
6568,ACT I.,That in my heart would make its way through hosts
6569,ACT I.,With levelled spears; and think you a few jailors

6575,ACT I.,_Mem._                   It will only serve
6576,ACT I.,More to exasperate his judges.

6578,ACT I.,_Mar._                         What

6582,ACT I.,_Sen._ Poor lady!
6583,ACT I.,
6584,ACT I.,_Mem._            'Tis mere desperation: she

6586,ACT I.,
6587,ACT I.,_Sen._                                  And

6593,ACT I.,"Thought that ""the Ten"" had even this touch of pity,"
6594,ACT I.,Or would permit assistance to this sufferer.
6595,ACT I.,
6596,ACT I.,_Sen._ Pity! Is't pity to recall to feeling
6597,ACT I.,The wretch too happy to escape to Death
6598,ACT I.,"By the compassionate trance, poor Nature's last"
6599,ACT I.,Resource against the tyranny of pain?
6600,ACT I.,
6601,ACT I.,_Mem._ I marvel they condemn him not at once.
6602,ACT I.,
6603,ACT I.,"_Sen._ That's not their policy: they'd have him live,"
6604,ACT I.,"Because he fears not death; and banish him,"
6605,ACT I.,"Because all earth, except his native land,                         290"
6606,ACT I.,"To him is one wide prison, and each breath"

6609,ACT I.,
6610,ACT I.,_Mem._                    Circumstance

6620,ACT I.,"_Sen._                  Yes, but to his country;"

6623,ACT I.,_Mem._ The accusation of the bribes was proved.
6624,ACT I.,
6625,ACT I.,"_Sen._ Not clearly, and the charge of homicide"

6630,ACT I.,_Mem._            Then why not clear him?

6632,ACT I.,_Sen._                                    That

6636,ACT I.,
6637,ACT I.,_Mem._ There must be more in this strange process than

6652,ACT I.,"_Bar._                         No,"
6653,ACT I.,That's not the cause; you saw the prisoner's state.
6654,ACT I.,
6655,ACT I.,_Lor._ And had he not recovered?
6656,ACT I.,
6657,ACT I.,_Bar._                           To relapse
6658,ACT I.,Upon the least renewal.

6660,ACT I.,_Lor._                 'Twas not tried.

6664,ACT I.,
6665,ACT I.,"_Lor._                      Thanks to _you_, sir,"
6666,ACT I.,"And the old ducal dotard, who combined"
6667,ACT I.,The worthy voices which o'er-ruled my own.
6668,ACT I.,
6669,ACT I.,_Bar._ I am a judge; but must confess that part
6670,ACT I.,"Of our stern duty, which prescribes the Question,[47]"
6671,ACT I.,"And bids us sit and see its sharp infliction,"
6672,ACT I.,Makes me wish--
6673,ACT I.,
6674,ACT I.,_Lor._          What?
6675,ACT I.,
6676,ACT I.,"_Bar._               That _you_ would _sometimes_ feel,"
6677,ACT I.,As I do always.
6678,ACT I.,
6679,ACT I.,"_Lor._        Go to, you're a child,"
6680,ACT I.,"Infirm of feeling as of purpose, blown"
6681,ACT I.,"About by every breath, shook[48] by a sigh,                        330"
6682,ACT I.,And melted by a tear--a precious judge
6683,ACT I.,For Venice! and a worthy statesman to
6684,ACT I.,Be partner in my policy.
6685,ACT I.,
6686,ACT I.,_Bar._                  He shed
6687,ACT I.,No tears.
6688,ACT I.,
6689,ACT I.,_Lor._   He cried out twice.
6690,ACT I.,
6691,ACT I.,"_Bar._                      A Saint had done so,"
6692,ACT I.,"Even with the crown of Glory in his eye,"
6693,ACT I.,At such inhuman artifice of pain
6694,ACT I.,As was forced on him; but he did not cry[az]
6695,ACT I.,"For pity; not a word nor groan escaped him,"
6696,ACT I.,"And those two shrieks were not in supplication,"
6697,ACT I.,"But wrung from pangs, and followed by no prayers.                  340"
6698,ACT I.,
6699,ACT I.,"_Lor._ He muttered many times between his teeth,"
6700,ACT I.,But inarticulately.[49]
6701,ACT I.,
6702,ACT I.,_Bar._              That I heard not:
6703,ACT I.,You stood more near him.
6704,ACT I.,
6705,ACT I.,_Lor._                   I did so.
6706,ACT I.,
6707,ACT I.,"_Bar._                            Methought,"
6708,ACT I.,"To my surprise too, you were touched with mercy,"
6709,ACT I.,And were the first to call out for assistance
6710,ACT I.,When he was failing.
6711,ACT I.,
6712,ACT I.,_Lor._              I believed that swoon
6713,ACT I.,His last.
6714,ACT I.,
6715,ACT I.,_Bar._    And have I not oft heard thee name
6716,ACT I.,His and his father's death your nearest wish?
6717,ACT I.,
6718,ACT I.,"_Lor._ If he dies innocent, that is to say,"
6719,ACT I.,"With his guilt unavowed, he'll be lamented.                        350"

6722,ACT I.,
6723,ACT I.,_Lor._                                    Wouldst thou have

6725,ACT I.,If he die unattainted?
6726,ACT I.,
6727,ACT I.,_Bar._                War with _them_ too?
6728,ACT I.,
6729,ACT I.,"_Lor._ With all their house, till theirs or mine are nothing."
6730,ACT I.,
6731,ACT I.,"_Bar._ And the deep agony of his pale wife,"
6732,ACT I.,And the repressed convulsion of the high
6733,ACT I.,"And princely brow of his old father, which"
6734,ACT I.,"Broke forth in a slight shuddering, though rarely,"
6735,ACT I.,"Or in some clammy drops, soon wiped away"
6736,ACT I.,In stern serenity; these moved you not?                            360
6737,ACT I.,[_Exit_ LOREDANO.
6738,ACT I.,"He's silent in his hate, as Foscari"
6739,ACT I.,Was in his suffering; and the poor wretch moved me
6740,ACT I.,More by his silence than a thousand outcries
6741,ACT I.,Could have effected. 'Twas a dreadful sight
6742,ACT I.,When his distracted wife broke through into
6743,ACT I.,"The hall of our tribunal, and beheld"
6744,ACT I.,"What we could scarcely look upon, long used"
6745,ACT I.,"To such sights. I must think no more of this,"
6746,ACT I.,Lest I forget in this compassion for
6747,ACT I.,"Our foes, their former injuries, and lose                          370"
6748,ACT I.,The hold of vengeance Loredano plans
6749,ACT I.,For him and me; but mine would be content
6750,ACT I.,"With lesser retribution than he thirsts for,"
6751,ACT I.,And I would mitigate his deeper hatred
6752,ACT I.,"To milder thoughts; but, for the present, Foscari"
6753,ACT I.,"Has a short hourly respite, granted at"
6754,ACT I.,"The instance of the elders of the Council,"
6755,ACT I.,Moved doubtless by his wife's appearance in
6756,ACT I.,"The hall, and his own sufferings.--Lo! they come:"
6757,ACT I.,How feeble and forlorn! I cannot bear                              380
6758,ACT I.,To look on them again in this extremity:
6759,ACT I.,"I'll hence, and try to soften Loredano.[ba]"

6768,ACT II.,
6769,ACT II.,_The_ DOGE _and a Senator_.
6770,ACT II.,
6771,ACT II.,_Sen._ Is it your pleasure to sign the report
6772,ACT II.,"Now, or postpone it till to-morrow?"
6773,ACT II.,
6774,ACT II.,_Doge_.                            Now;
6775,ACT II.,I overlooked it yesterday: it wants
6776,ACT II.,Merely the signature. Give me the pen--
6777,ACT II.,[_The_ DOGE _sits down and signs the paper_.
6778,ACT II.,"There, Signor."
6779,ACT II.,
6780,ACT II.,_Sen._ (_looking at the paper_). You have forgot; it is not signed.
6781,ACT II.,
6782,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Not signed? Ah, I perceive my eyes begin"
6783,ACT II.,To wax more weak with age. I did not see
6784,ACT II.,That I had dipped the pen without effect.[bb]
6785,ACT II.,
6786,ACT II.,"_Sen._ (_dipping the pen into the ink, and placing the paper"
6787,ACT II.,"before the_ DOGE). Your hand, too, shakes, my Lord: allow me, thus--"
6788,ACT II.,
6789,ACT II.,"_Doge_. 'Tis done, I thank you."
6790,ACT II.,
6791,ACT II.,_Sen._                          Thus the act confirmed              10
6792,ACT II.,"By you and by ""the Ten"" gives peace to Venice."
6793,ACT II.,

6796,ACT II.,
6797,ACT II.,_Sen._                          'Tis almost
6798,ACT II.,Thirty-four years of nearly ceaseless warfare
6799,ACT II.,"With the Turk, or the powers of Italy;"
6800,ACT II.,The state had need of some repose.
6801,ACT II.,
6802,ACT II.,_Doge_.                            No doubt:
6803,ACT II.,"I found her Queen of Ocean, and I leave her"
6804,ACT II.,Lady of Lombardy; it is a comfort[bc]
6805,ACT II.,That I have added to her diadem
6806,ACT II.,The gems of Brescia and Ravenna; Crema[50]                          20
6807,ACT II.,And Bergamo no less are hers; her realm
6808,ACT II.,"By land has grown by thus much in my reign,"
6809,ACT II.,While her sea-sway has not shrunk.
6810,ACT II.,
6811,ACT II.,"_Sen._                           'Tis most true,"
6812,ACT II.,And merits all our country's gratitude.
6813,ACT II.,
6814,ACT II.,_Doge_. Perhaps so.
6815,ACT II.,
6816,ACT II.,_Sen._              Which should be made manifest.
6817,ACT II.,
6818,ACT II.,"_Doge_. I have not complained, sir."
6819,ACT II.,
6820,ACT II.,"_Sen._                              My good Lord, forgive me."
6821,ACT II.,
6822,ACT II.,_Doge_. For what?
6823,ACT II.,
6824,ACT II.,_Sen._            My heart bleeds for you.
6825,ACT II.,
6826,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                                  For me, Signor?"

6832,ACT II.,"_Sen._                        It must have way, my Lord:"
6833,ACT II.,I have too many duties towards you
6834,ACT II.,"And all your house, for past and present kindness,                  30"
6835,ACT II.,Not to feel deeply for your son.
6836,ACT II.,
6837,ACT II.,_Doge_.                         Was this
6838,ACT II.,In your commission?
6839,ACT II.,
6840,ACT II.,"_Sen._             What, my Lord?"
6841,ACT II.,
6842,ACT II.,_Doge_.                          This prattle
6843,ACT II.,Of things you know not: but the treaty's signed;

6851,ACT II.,If it so please them: I am the State's servant.
6852,ACT II.,
6853,ACT II.,_Sen._ They would accord some time for your repose.
6854,ACT II.,
6855,ACT II.,"_Doge_. I have no repose, that is, none which shall cause           40"
6856,ACT II.,The loss of an hour's time unto the State.
6857,ACT II.,"Let them meet when they will, I shall be found"

6897,ACT II.,_Mar._                'Tis revoked.
6898,ACT II.,
6899,ACT II.,_Doge_.                             By whom?
6900,ACT II.,
6901,ACT II.,"_Mar._ ""The Ten.""--When we had reached ""the Bridge of Sighs,""[51]"
6902,ACT II.,"Which I prepared to pass with Foscari,"
6903,ACT II.,The gloomy guardian of that passage first
6904,ACT II.,Demurred: a messenger was sent back to
6905,ACT II.,"""The Ten;""--but as the Court no longer sate,"
6906,ACT II.,"And no permission had been given in writing,"
6907,ACT II.,"I was thrust back, with the assurance that                          60"
6908,ACT II.,Until that high tribunal reassembled
6909,ACT II.,The dungeon walls must still divide us.
6910,ACT II.,
6911,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                                True,"
6912,ACT II.,The form has been omitted in the haste
6913,ACT II.,"With which the court adjourned; and till it meets,"
6914,ACT II.,'Tis dubious.
6915,ACT II.,
6916,ACT II.,"_Mar._       Till it meets! and when it meets,"
6917,ACT II.,They'll torture him again; and he and I
6918,ACT II.,Must purchase by renewal of the rack
6919,ACT II.,"The interview of husband and of wife,"
6920,ACT II.,The holiest tie beneath the Heavens!--Oh God!
6921,ACT II.,Dost thou see this?
6922,ACT II.,
6923,ACT II.,_Doge_.            Child--child----
6924,ACT II.,
6925,ACT II.,"_Mar._ (_abruptly_).        Call _me_ not ""child!""                  70"
6926,ACT II.,You soon will have no children--you deserve none--
6927,ACT II.,"You, who can talk thus calmly of a son"
6928,ACT II.,In circumstances which would call forth tears
6929,ACT II.,Of blood from Spartans! Though these did not weep
6930,ACT II.,"Their boys who died in battle, is it written"
6931,ACT II.,"That they beheld them perish piecemeal, nor"
6932,ACT II.,Stretched forth a hand to save them?
6933,ACT II.,
6934,ACT II.,_Doge_.                             You behold me:
6935,ACT II.,I cannot weep--I would I could; but if
6936,ACT II.,"Each white hair on this head were a young life,"
6937,ACT II.,"This ducal cap the Diadem of earth,                                 80"
6938,ACT II.,This ducal ring with which I wed the waves
6939,ACT II.,A talisman to still them--I'd give all
6940,ACT II.,For him.
6941,ACT II.,
6942,ACT II.,_Mar._   With less he surely might be saved.
6943,ACT II.,
6944,ACT II.,_Doge_. That answer only shows you know not Venice.
6945,ACT II.,"Alas! how should you? she knows not herself,"
6946,ACT II.,In all her mystery. Hear me--they who aim
6947,ACT II.,"At Foscari, aim no less at his father;"
6948,ACT II.,The sire's destruction would not save the son;
6949,ACT II.,"They work by different means to the same end,"
6950,ACT II.,And that is--but they have not conquered yet.                       90
6951,ACT II.,
6952,ACT II.,_Mar._ But they have crushed.
6953,ACT II.,
6954,ACT II.,_Doge_.                        Nor crushed as yet--I live.
6955,ACT II.,
6956,ACT II.,"_Mar._ And your son,--how long will he live?"
6957,ACT II.,
6958,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                                       I trust,"
6959,ACT II.,"For all that yet is past, as many years"
6960,ACT II.,"And happier than his father. The rash boy,"
6961,ACT II.,"With womanish impatience to return,"
6962,ACT II.,Hath ruined all by that detected letter:
6963,ACT II.,"A high crime, which I neither can deny"
6964,ACT II.,"Nor palliate, as parent or as Duke:"
6965,ACT II.,"Had he but borne a little, little longer"
6966,ACT II.,"His Candiote exile, I had hopes--he has quenched them--            100"
6967,ACT II.,He must return.
6968,ACT II.,
6969,ACT II.,_Mar._         To exile?
6970,ACT II.,
6971,ACT II.,_Doge_.                 I have said it.
6972,ACT II.,
6973,ACT II.,_Mar._ And can I not go with him?
6974,ACT II.,
6975,ACT II.,_Doge_.                            You well know
6976,ACT II.,This prayer of yours was twice denied before
6977,ACT II.,"By the assembled ""Ten,"" and hardly now"
6978,ACT II.,"Will be accorded to a third request,"
6979,ACT II.,Since aggravated errors on the part
6980,ACT II.,Of your Lord renders them still more austere.
6981,ACT II.,
6982,ACT II.,"_Mar._ Austere? Atrocious! The old human fiends,"
6983,ACT II.,"With one foot in the grave, with dim eyes, strange"
6984,ACT II.,"To tears save drops of dotage, with long white[bd]                 110"
6985,ACT II.,"And scanty hairs, and shaking hands, and heads"
6986,ACT II.,"As palsied as their hearts are hard, they counsel,"
6987,ACT II.,"Cabal, and put men's lives out, as if Life"
6988,ACT II.,Were no more than the feelings long extinguished
6989,ACT II.,In their accurséd bosoms.
6990,ACT II.,
6991,ACT II.,_Doge_.                  You know not----
6992,ACT II.,
6993,ACT II.,"_Mar._ I do--I do--and so should you, methinks--"
6994,ACT II.,That these are demons: could it be else that
6995,ACT II.,"Men, who have been of women born and suckled--"
6996,ACT II.,"Who have loved, or talked at least of Love--have given"
6997,ACT II.,Their hands in sacred vows--have danced their babes                120
6998,ACT II.,"Upon their knees, perhaps have mourned above them--"
6999,ACT II.,"In pain, in peril, or in death--who are,"
7000,ACT II.,"Or were, at least in seeming, human, could"
7001,ACT II.,"Do as they have done by yours, and you yourself--"
7002,ACT II.,"_You_, who abet them?"
7003,ACT II.,
7004,ACT II.,"_Doge_.              I forgive this, for"
7005,ACT II.,You know not what you say.
7006,ACT II.,
7007,ACT II.,"_Mar._                    _You_ know it well,"
7008,ACT II.,And feel it nothing.
7009,ACT II.,
7010,ACT II.,"_Doge_.             I have borne so much,"
7011,ACT II.,That words have ceased to shake me.
7012,ACT II.,
7013,ACT II.,"_Mar._                             Oh, no doubt!"
7014,ACT II.,"You have seen your son's blood flow, and your flesh shook not;"
7015,ACT II.,"And after that, what are a woman's words?                          130"
7016,ACT II.,"No more than woman's tears, that they should shake you."
7017,ACT II.,
7018,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Woman, this clamorous grief of thine, I tell thee,"
7019,ACT II.,Is no more in the balance weighed with that
7020,ACT II.,"Which----but I pity thee, my poor Marina!"
7021,ACT II.,
7022,ACT II.,"_Mar._ Pity my husband, or I cast it from me;"
7023,ACT II.,Pity thy son! _Thou_ pity!--'tis a word
7024,ACT II.,Strange to thy heart--how came it on thy lips?
7025,ACT II.,
7026,ACT II.,"_Doge_. I must bear these reproaches, though they wrong me."
7027,ACT II.,Couldst thou but read----
7028,ACT II.,
7029,ACT II.,"_Mar._                   'Tis not upon thy brow,"
7030,ACT II.,"Nor in thine eyes, nor in thine acts,--where then                  140"
7031,ACT II.,Should I behold this sympathy? or shall?
7032,ACT II.,
7033,ACT II.,_Doge_ (_pointing downwards_). There.
7034,ACT II.,
7035,ACT II.,_Mar._                               In the earth?
7036,ACT II.,
7037,ACT II.,_Doge_.                                 To which I am tending: when
7038,ACT II.,"It lies upon this heart, far lightlier, though"
7039,ACT II.,"Loaded with marble, than the thoughts which press it"
7040,ACT II.,"Now, you will know me better."
7041,ACT II.,
7042,ACT II.,"_Mar._                       Are you, then,"
7043,ACT II.,"Indeed, thus to be pitied?"
7044,ACT II.,
7045,ACT II.,_Doge_.                   Pitied! None
7046,ACT II.,"Shall ever use that base word, with which men"
7047,ACT II.,"Cloak their soul's hoarded triumph, as a fit one"
7048,ACT II.,"To mingle with my name; that name shall be,"
7049,ACT II.,"As far as _I_ have borne it, what it was                           150"
7050,ACT II.,When I received it.
7051,ACT II.,
7052,ACT II.,_Mar._             But for the poor children
7053,ACT II.,"Of him thou canst not, or thou wilt not save,"
7054,ACT II.,You were the last to bear it.
7055,ACT II.,
7056,ACT II.,_Doge_.                      Would it were so!
7057,ACT II.,Better for him he never had been born;
7058,ACT II.,Better for me.--I have seen our house dishonoured.
7059,ACT II.,
7060,ACT II.,"_Mar._ That's false! A truer, nobler, trustier heart,"
7061,ACT II.,"More loving, or more loyal, never beat"
7062,ACT II.,Within a human breast. I would not change
7063,ACT II.,"My exiled, persecuted, mangled husband,"
7064,ACT II.,"Oppressed but not disgraced, crushed, overwhelmed,                 160"
7065,ACT II.,"Alive, or dead, for Prince or Paladin"
7066,ACT II.,"In story or in fable, with a world"
7067,ACT II.,To back his suit. Dishonoured!--_he_ dishonoured!
7068,ACT II.,"I tell thee, Doge, 'tis Venice is dishonoured;"
7069,ACT II.,"His name shall be her foulest, worst reproach,"
7070,ACT II.,"For what he suffers, not for what he did."
7071,ACT II.,"'Tis ye who are all traitors, Tyrant!--ye!"
7072,ACT II.,Did you but love your Country like this victim
7073,ACT II.,"Who totters back in chains to tortures, and"
7074,ACT II.,"Submits to all things rather than to exile,                        170"
7075,ACT II.,"You'd fling yourselves before him, and implore"
7076,ACT II.,His grace for your enormous guilt.
7077,ACT II.,
7078,ACT II.,_Doge_.                            He was
7079,ACT II.,Indeed all you have said. I better bore
7080,ACT II.,"The deaths of the two sons[52] Heaven took from me,"
7081,ACT II.,Than Jacopo's disgrace.
7082,ACT II.,
7083,ACT II.,_Mar._                 That word again?
7084,ACT II.,
7085,ACT II.,_Doge_. Has he not been condemned?
7086,ACT II.,
7087,ACT II.,_Mar._                            Is none but guilt so?
7088,ACT II.,
7089,ACT II.,_Doge_. Time may restore his memory--I would hope so.
7090,ACT II.,"He was my pride, my----but 'tis useless now--"
7091,ACT II.,"I am not given to tears, but wept for joy"
7092,ACT II.,When he was born: those drops were ominous.                        180
7093,ACT II.,
7094,ACT II.,"_Mar._ I say he's innocent! And were he not so,"
7095,ACT II.,Is our own blood and kin to shrink from us
7096,ACT II.,In fatal moments?
7097,ACT II.,
7098,ACT II.,_Doge_.          I shrank not from him:
7099,ACT II.,But I have other duties than a father's;
7100,ACT II.,The state would not dispense me from those duties;
7101,ACT II.,"Twice I demanded it, but was refused:[53]"
7102,ACT II.,They must then be fulfilled.
7103,ACT II.,
7104,ACT II.,_Enter an Attendant_.
7105,ACT II.,
7106,ACT II.,_Att._                     A message from
7107,ACT II.,"""The Ten."""
7108,ACT II.,
7109,ACT II.,_Doge_.   Who bears it?
7110,ACT II.,
7111,ACT II.,_Att._                 Noble Loredano.
7112,ACT II.,
7113,ACT II.,_Doge_. He!--but admit him.                         [_Exit Attendant_.
7114,ACT II.,
7115,ACT II.,_Mar._                      Must I then retire?
7116,ACT II.,
7117,ACT II.,"_Doge_. Perhaps it is not requisite, if this                       190"
7118,ACT II.,"Concerns your husband, and if not----Well, Signor,"
7119,ACT II.,[_To_ LOREDANO _entering_.
7120,ACT II.,Your pleasure?
7121,ACT II.,
7122,ACT II.,"_Lor._        I bear that of ""the Ten."""
7123,ACT II.,
7124,ACT II.,_Doge_.                                They
7125,ACT II.,Have chosen well their envoy.
7126,ACT II.,
7127,ACT II.,_Lor._                       'Tis _their_ choice
7128,ACT II.,Which leads me here.
7129,ACT II.,
7130,ACT II.,"_Doge_.            It does their wisdom honour,"
7131,ACT II.,And no less to their courtesy.--Proceed.
7132,ACT II.,
7133,ACT II.,_Lor._ We have decided.
7134,ACT II.,
7135,ACT II.,_Doge_.                  We?
7136,ACT II.,
7137,ACT II.,"_Lor._                       ""The Ten"" in council."
7138,ACT II.,
7139,ACT II.,"_Doge_. What! have they met again, and met without"
7140,ACT II.,Apprising me?
7141,ACT II.,
7142,ACT II.,"_Lor._       They wished to spare your feelings,"
7143,ACT II.,No less than age.
7144,ACT II.,
7145,ACT II.,_Doge_.          That's new--when spared they either?
7146,ACT II.,"I thank them, notwithstanding."
7147,ACT II.,
7148,ACT II.,_Lor._                        You know well                         200
7149,ACT II.,"That they have power to act at their discretion,"
7150,ACT II.,With or without the presence of the Doge.
7151,ACT II.,
7152,ACT II.,"_Doge_. 'Tis some years since I learned this, long before"
7153,ACT II.,"I became Doge, or dreamed of such advancement."
7154,ACT II.,"You need not school me, Signor; I sate in"
7155,ACT II.,That Council when you were a young patrician.
7156,ACT II.,
7157,ACT II.,"_Lor._ True, in my father's time; I have heard him and"
7158,ACT II.,"The Admiral, his brother, say as much."
7159,ACT II.,Your Highness may remember them; they both
7160,ACT II.,Died suddenly.[54]
7161,ACT II.,
7162,ACT II.,"_Doge_.       And if they did so, better                           210"
7163,ACT II.,So die than live on lingeringly in pain.
7164,ACT II.,
7165,ACT II.,_Lor._ No doubt: yet most men like to live their days out.
7166,ACT II.,
7167,ACT II.,_Doge_. And did not they?
7168,ACT II.,
7169,ACT II.,"_Lor._                   The Grave knows best: they died,"
7170,ACT II.,"As I said, suddenly."
7171,ACT II.,
7172,ACT II.,"_Doge_.             Is that so strange,"
7173,ACT II.,That you repeat the word emphatically?
7174,ACT II.,
7175,ACT II.,"_Lor._ So far from strange, that never was there death"
7176,ACT II.,In my mind half so natural as theirs.
7177,ACT II.,Think _you_ not so?
7178,ACT II.,
7179,ACT II.,_Doge_.              What should I think of mortals?
7180,ACT II.,
7181,ACT II.,_Lor._ That they have mortal foes.
7182,ACT II.,
7183,ACT II.,_Doge_.                           I understand you;
7184,ACT II.,"Your sires were mine, and you are heir in all things.              220"
7185,ACT II.,
7186,ACT II.,_Lor._ You best know if I should be so.
7187,ACT II.,
7188,ACT II.,_Doge_.                                  I do.
7189,ACT II.,"Your fathers were my foes, and I have heard"
7190,ACT II.,Foul rumours were abroad; I have also read
7191,ACT II.,"Their epitaph, attributing their deaths"
7192,ACT II.,To poison. 'Tis perhaps as true as most
7193,ACT II.,"Inscriptions upon tombs, and yet no less"
7194,ACT II.,A fable.
7195,ACT II.,
7196,ACT II.,_Lor._   Who dares say so?
7197,ACT II.,
7198,ACT II.,_Doge_.                   I!----'Tis true
7199,ACT II.,"Your fathers were mine enemies, as bitter"
7200,ACT II.,"As their son e'er can be, and I no less"
7201,ACT II.,Was theirs; but I was _openly_ their foe:                          230
7202,ACT II.,"I never worked by plot in Council, nor"
7203,ACT II.,"Cabal in commonwealth, nor secret means"
7204,ACT II.,Of practice against life by steel or drug.
7205,ACT II.,The proof is--your existence.
7206,ACT II.,
7207,ACT II.,_Lor._                       I fear not.
7208,ACT II.,
7209,ACT II.,"_Doge_. You have no cause, being what I am; but were I"
7210,ACT II.,"That you would have me thought, you long ere now"
7211,ACT II.,Were past the sense of fear. Hate on; I care not.
7212,ACT II.,
7213,ACT II.,_Lor._ I never yet knew that a noble's life
7214,ACT II.,"In Venice had to dread a Doge's frown,"
7215,ACT II.,"That is, by open means."
7216,ACT II.,
7217,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                But I, good Signor,                         240"
7218,ACT II.,"Am, or at least _was_, more than a mere duke,"
7219,ACT II.,"In blood, in mind, in means; and that they know"
7220,ACT II.,"Who dreaded to elect me, and have since"
7221,ACT II.,"Striven all they dare to weigh me down: be sure,"
7222,ACT II.,"Before or since that period, had I held you"
7223,ACT II.,"At so much price as to require your absence,"
7224,ACT II.,A word of mine had set such spirits to work
7225,ACT II.,As would have made you nothing. But in all things
7226,ACT II.,I have observed the strictest reverence;
7227,ACT II.,"Not for the laws alone, for those _you_ have strained              250"
7228,ACT II.,(I do not speak of _you_ but as a single
7229,ACT II.,Voice of the many) somewhat beyond what
7230,ACT II.,"I could enforce for my authority,"
7231,ACT II.,"Were I disposed to brawl; but, as I said,"
7232,ACT II.,"I have observed with veneration, like"
7233,ACT II.,"A priest's for the High Altar, even unto"
7234,ACT II.,"The sacrifice of my own blood and quiet,"
7235,ACT II.,"Safety, and all save honour, the decrees,"
7236,ACT II.,"The health, the pride, and welfare of the State."
7237,ACT II.,"And now, sir, to your business."
7238,ACT II.,
7239,ACT II.,"_Lor._                        'Tis decreed,                        260"
7240,ACT II.,"That, without further repetition of"
7241,ACT II.,"The Question, or continuance of the trial,"
7242,ACT II.,"Which only tends to show how stubborn guilt is,"
7243,ACT II.,"(""The Ten,"" dispensing with the stricter law"
7244,ACT II.,Which still prescribes the Question till a full
7245,ACT II.,"Confession, and the prisoner partly having"
7246,ACT II.,Avowed his crime in not denying that
7247,ACT II.,"The letter to the Duke of Milan's his),"
7248,ACT II.,"James Foscari return to banishment,"
7249,ACT II.,And sail in the same galley which conveyed him.                    270
7250,ACT II.,
7251,ACT II.,_Mar._ Thank God! At least they will not drag him more
7252,ACT II.,Before that horrible tribunal. Would he
7253,ACT II.,"But think so, to my mind the happiest doom,"
7254,ACT II.,"Not he alone, but all who dwell here, could"
7255,ACT II.,"Desire, were to escape from such a land."
7256,ACT II.,
7257,ACT II.,"_Doge_. That is not a Venetian thought, my daughter."
7258,ACT II.,
7259,ACT II.,"_Mar._ No, 'twas too human. May I share his exile?"
7260,ACT II.,
7261,ACT II.,"_Lor._ Of this ""the Ten"" said nothing."
7262,ACT II.,
7263,ACT II.,_Mar._                                 So I thought!
7264,ACT II.,"That were too human, also. But it was not"
7265,ACT II.,Inhibited?
7266,ACT II.,
7267,ACT II.,_Lor._    It was not named.
7268,ACT II.,
7269,ACT II.,"_Mar. (to the Doge_).      Then, father,                           280"
7270,ACT II.,Surely you can obtain or grant me thus much:
7271,ACT II.,[_To_ LOREDANO.
7272,ACT II.,"And you, sir, not oppose my prayer to be"
7273,ACT II.,Permitted to accompany my husband.
7274,ACT II.,
7275,ACT II.,_Doge_. I will endeavour.
7276,ACT II.,
7277,ACT II.,"_Mar._                   And you, Signor?"
7278,ACT II.,
7279,ACT II.,_Lor._                                   Lady!
7280,ACT II.,'Tis not for me to anticipate the pleasure
7281,ACT II.,Of the tribunal.
7282,ACT II.,
7283,ACT II.,_Mar._          Pleasure! what a word
7284,ACT II.,To use for the decrees of----
7285,ACT II.,
7286,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                   Daughter, know you"
7287,ACT II.,In what a presence you pronounce these things?
7288,ACT II.,
7289,ACT II.,_Mar._ A Prince's and his subject's.
7290,ACT II.,
7291,ACT II.,_Lor._                               Subject!
7292,ACT II.,
7293,ACT II.,_Mar._                                       Oh!
7294,ACT II.,"It galls you:--well, you are his equal, as                         290"
7295,ACT II.,"You think; but that you are not, nor would be,"
7296,ACT II.,"Were he a peasant:--well, then, you're a Prince,"
7297,ACT II.,A princely noble; and what then am I?
7298,ACT II.,
7299,ACT II.,_Lor._ The offspring of a noble house.
7300,ACT II.,
7301,ACT II.,_Mar._                                And wedded
7302,ACT II.,"To one as noble. What, or whose, then, is"
7303,ACT II.,The presence that should silence my free thoughts?
7304,ACT II.,
7305,ACT II.,_Lor._ The presence of your husband's Judges.
7306,ACT II.,
7307,ACT II.,_Doge_.                                       And
7308,ACT II.,The deference due even to the lightest word
7309,ACT II.,That falls from those who rule in Venice.
7310,ACT II.,
7311,ACT II.,_Mar._                                    Keep
7312,ACT II.,"Those maxims for your mass of scared mechanics,                    300"
7313,ACT II.,"Your merchants, your Dalmatian and Greek slaves,"
7314,ACT II.,"Your tributaries, your dumb citizens,"
7315,ACT II.,"And masked nobility, your sbirri, and"
7316,ACT II.,"Your spies, your galley and your other slaves,"
7317,ACT II.,"To whom your midnight carryings off and drownings,"
7318,ACT II.,"Your dungeons next the palace roofs, or under"
7319,ACT II.,"The water's level;[55] your mysterious meetings,"
7320,ACT II.,"And unknown dooms, and sudden executions,"
7321,ACT II.,"Your ""Bridge of Sighs,"" your strangling chamber, and"
7322,ACT II.,"Your torturing instruments, have made ye seem                      310"
7323,ACT II.,The beings of another and worse world!
7324,ACT II.,Keep such for them: I fear ye not. I know ye;[be]
7325,ACT II.,"Have known and proved your worst, in the infernal"
7326,ACT II.,Process of my poor husband! Treat me as
7327,ACT II.,"Ye treated him:--you did so, in so dealing"
7328,ACT II.,"With him. Then what have I to fear _from_ you,"
7329,ACT II.,"Even if I were of fearful nature, which"
7330,ACT II.,I trust I am not?
7331,ACT II.,
7332,ACT II.,"_Doge_.          You hear, she speaks wildly."
7333,ACT II.,
7334,ACT II.,"_Mar._ Not wisely, yet not wildly."
7335,ACT II.,
7336,ACT II.,_Lor._                             Lady! words
7337,ACT II.,Uttered within these walls I bear no further                       320
7338,ACT II.,"Than to the threshold, saving such as pass"
7339,ACT II.,Between the Duke and me on the State's service.
7340,ACT II.,Doge! have you aught in answer?
7341,ACT II.,
7342,ACT II.,_Doge_.                        Something from
7343,ACT II.,The Doge; it may be also from a parent.
7344,ACT II.,
7345,ACT II.,_Lor._ My mission _here_ is to the _Doge_.
7346,ACT II.,
7347,ACT II.,_Doge_.                                   Then say
7348,ACT II.,"The Doge will choose his own ambassador,"
7349,ACT II.,Or state in person what is meet; and for
7350,ACT II.,The father----
7351,ACT II.,
7352,ACT II.,_Lor._        I remember _mine_.--Farewell!
7353,ACT II.,"I kiss the hands of the illustrious Lady,"
7354,ACT II.,And bow me to the Duke.                              [_Exit_ LOREDANO.
7355,ACT II.,
7356,ACT II.,_Mar._                 Are you content?                           330
7357,ACT II.,
7358,ACT II.,_Doge_. I am what you behold.
7359,ACT II.,
7360,ACT II.,_Mar._                       And that's a mystery.
7361,ACT II.,
7362,ACT II.,_Doge_. All things are so to mortals; who can read them
7363,ACT II.,"Save he who made? or, if they can, the few"
7364,ACT II.,"And gifted spirits, who have studied long"
7365,ACT II.,"That loathsome volume--man, and pored upon"
7366,ACT II.,"Those black and bloody leaves, his heart and brain,[bf]"
7367,ACT II.,But learn a magic which recoils upon
7368,ACT II.,The adept who pursues it: all the sins
7369,ACT II.,"We find in others, Nature made our own;"
7370,ACT II.,All our advantages are those of Fortune;                           340
7371,ACT II.,"Birth, wealth, health, beauty, are her accidents,"
7372,ACT II.,"And when we cry out against Fate, 'twere well"
7373,ACT II.,We should remember Fortune can take nought
7374,ACT II.,"Save what she _gave_--the rest was nakedness,"
7375,ACT II.,"And lusts, and appetites, and vanities,"
7376,ACT II.,"The universal heritage, to battle"
7377,ACT II.,"With as we may, and least in humblest stations,[bg]"
7378,ACT II.,"Where Hunger swallows all in one low want,[bh]"
7379,ACT II.,"And the original ordinance, that man"
7380,ACT II.,"Must sweat for his poor pittance, keeps all passions               350"
7381,ACT II.,"Aloof, save fear of famine! All is low,"
7382,ACT II.,"And false, and hollow--clay from first to last,"
7383,ACT II.,The Prince's urn no less than potter's vessel.
7384,ACT II.,"Our Fame is in men's breath, our lives upon"
7385,ACT II.,Less than their breath; our durance upon days[bi]
7386,ACT II.,Our days on seasons; our whole being on
7387,ACT II.,"Something which is not _us_![56]--So, we are slaves,"
7388,ACT II.,The greatest as the meanest--nothing rests
7389,ACT II.,Upon our will; the will itself no less[bj]
7390,ACT II.,Depends upon a straw than on a storm;                              360
7391,ACT II.,"And when we think we lead, we are most led,[57]"
7392,ACT II.,"And still towards Death, a thing which comes as much"
7393,ACT II.,"Without our act or choice as birth, so that"
7394,ACT II.,"Methinks we must have sinned in some old world,"
7395,ACT II.,"And _this_ is Hell: the best is, that it is not"
7396,ACT II.,Eternal.
7397,ACT II.,
7398,ACT II.,_Mar._ These are things we cannot judge
7399,ACT II.,On earth.
7400,ACT II.,
7401,ACT II.,"_Doge_. And how then shall we judge each other,"
7402,ACT II.,"Who are all earth, and I, who am called upon"
7403,ACT II.,To judge my son? I have administered
7404,ACT II.,My country faithfully--victoriously--                              370
7405,ACT II.,"I dare them to the proof, the _chart_ of what"
7406,ACT II.,She was and is: my reign has doubled realms;
7407,ACT II.,"And, in reward, the gratitude of Venice"
7408,ACT II.,"Has left, or is about to leave, _me_ single."
7409,ACT II.,
7410,ACT II.,"_Mar._ And Foscari? I do not think of such things,"
7411,ACT II.,So I be left with him.
7412,ACT II.,
7413,ACT II.,_Doge_.               You shall be so;
7414,ACT II.,Thus much they cannot well deny.
7415,ACT II.,
7416,ACT II.,_Mar._                          And if
7417,ACT II.,"They should, I will fly with him."
7418,ACT II.,
7419,ACT II.,_Doge_.                         That can ne'er be.
7420,ACT II.,And whither would you fly?
7421,ACT II.,
7422,ACT II.,"_Mar._                    I know not, reck not--"
7423,ACT II.,"To Syria, Egypt, to the Ottoman--                                  380"
7424,ACT II.,"Any where, where we might respire unfettered,"
7425,ACT II.,"And live nor girt by spies, nor liable"
7426,ACT II.,To edicts of inquisitors of state.
7427,ACT II.,
7428,ACT II.,"_Doge_. What, wouldst thou have a renegade for husband,"
7429,ACT II.,And turn him into traitor?
7430,ACT II.,
7431,ACT II.,_Mar._                    He is none!
7432,ACT II.,"The Country is the traitress, which thrusts forth"
7433,ACT II.,Her best and bravest from her. Tyranny
7434,ACT II.,Is far the worst of treasons. Dost thou deem
7435,ACT II.,None rebels except subjects? The Prince who
7436,ACT II.,Neglects or violates his trust is more                             390
7437,ACT II.,A brigand than the robber-chief.
7438,ACT II.,
7439,ACT II.,_Doge_.                          I cannot
7440,ACT II.,Charge me with such a breach of faith.
7441,ACT II.,
7442,ACT II.,_Mar_                                 No; thou
7443,ACT II.,"Observ'st, obey'st such laws as make old Draco's"
7444,ACT II.,A code of mercy by comparison.
7445,ACT II.,
7446,ACT II.,_Doge_. I found the law; I did not make it. Were I
7447,ACT II.,"A subject, still I might find parts and portions"
7448,ACT II.,"Fit for amendment; but as Prince, I never"
7449,ACT II.,"Would change, for the sake of my house, the charter"
7450,ACT II.,Left by our fathers.
7451,ACT II.,
7452,ACT II.,_Mar._              Did they make it for
7453,ACT II.,The ruin of their children?
7454,ACT II.,
7455,ACT II.,"_Doge_.                    Under such laws, Venice                 400"
7456,ACT II.,Has risen to what she is--a state to rival
7457,ACT II.,"In deeds, and days, and sway, and, let me add,"
7458,ACT II.,In glory (for we have had Roman spirits
7459,ACT II.,"Amongst us), all that history has bequeathed"
7460,ACT II.,"Of Rome and Carthage in their best times, when"
7461,ACT II.,The people swayed by Senates.
7462,ACT II.,
7463,ACT II.,"_Mar._                       Rather say,"
7464,ACT II.,Groaned under the stern Oligarchs.
7465,ACT II.,
7466,ACT II.,_Doge_.                           Perhaps so;
7467,ACT II.,But yet subdued the World: in such a state
7468,ACT II.,"An individual, be he richest of"
7469,ACT II.,"Such rank as is permitted, or the meanest,                         410"
7470,ACT II.,"Without a name, is alike nothing, when"
7471,ACT II.,"The policy, irrevocably tending"
7472,ACT II.,"To one great end, must be maintained in vigour."
7473,ACT II.,
7474,ACT II.,_Mar._ This means that you are more a Doge than father.
7475,ACT II.,
7476,ACT II.,"_Doge_. It means, I am more citizen than either."
7477,ACT II.,If we had not for many centuries
7478,ACT II.,"Had thousands of such citizens, and shall,"
7479,ACT II.,"I trust, have still such, Venice were no city."
7480,ACT II.,
7481,ACT II.,_Mar._ Accurséd be the city where the laws
7482,ACT II.,Would stifle Nature's!
7483,ACT II.,
7484,ACT II.,_Doge_.               Had I as many sons                           420
7485,ACT II.,"As I have years, I would have given them all,"
7486,ACT II.,"Not without feeling, but I would have given them"
7487,ACT II.,"To the State's service, to fulfil her wishes,"
7488,ACT II.,"On the flood, in the field, or, if it must be,"
7489,ACT II.,"As it, alas! has been, to ostracism,"
7490,ACT II.,"Exile, or chains, or whatsoever worse"
7491,ACT II.,She might decree.
7492,ACT II.,
7493,ACT II.,_Mar._           And this is Patriotism?
7494,ACT II.,To me it seems the worst barbarity.
7495,ACT II.,"Let me seek out my husband: the sage ""Ten,"""
7496,ACT II.,"With all its jealousy, will hardly war                             430"
7497,ACT II.,So far with a weak woman as deny me
7498,ACT II.,A moment's access to his dungeon.
7499,ACT II.,
7500,ACT II.,_Doge_.                          I'll
7501,ACT II.,"So far take on myself, as order that"
7502,ACT II.,You may be admitted.
7503,ACT II.,
7504,ACT II.,_Mar._              And what shall I say
7505,ACT II.,To Foscari from his father?
7506,ACT II.,
7507,ACT II.,_Doge_.                    That he obey
7508,ACT II.,The laws.
7509,ACT II.,
7510,ACT II.,_Mar._   And nothing more? Will you not see him
7511,ACT II.,Ere he depart? It may be the last time.
7512,ACT II.,
7513,ACT II.,_Doge_. The last!--my boy!--the last time I shall see
7514,ACT II.,My last of children! Tell him I will come.                  [_Exeunt_.
7515,ACT II.,

7518,ACT III.,ACT III.
7519,ACT III.,
7520,ACT III.,
7521,ACT III.,SCENE I.--_The prison of_ JACOPO FOSCARI.
7522,ACT III.,
7523,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ (_solus_).
7524,ACT III.,"No light, save yon faint gleam which shows me walls"
7525,ACT III.,"Which never echoed but to Sorrow's sounds,[58]"
7526,ACT III.,"The sigh of long imprisonment, the step"
7527,ACT III.,Of feet on which the iron clanked the groan
7528,ACT III.,"Of Death, the imprecation of Despair!"
7529,ACT III.,"And yet for this I have returned to Venice,"
7530,ACT III.,"With some faint hope, 'tis true, that Time, which wears"
7531,ACT III.,"The marble down, had worn away the hate"
7532,ACT III.,"Of men's hearts; but I knew them not, and here"
7533,ACT III.,"Must I consume my own, which never beat                             10"
7534,ACT III.,For Venice but with such a yearning as
7535,ACT III.,"The dove has for her distant nest, when wheeling"
7536,ACT III.,High in the air on her return to greet
7537,ACT III.,Her callow brood. What letters are these which
7538,ACT III.,[_Approaching the wall_.
7539,ACT III.,Are scrawled along the inexorable wall?
7540,ACT III.,Will the gleam let me trace them? Ah! the names
7541,ACT III.,"Of my sad predecessors in this place,[59]"
7542,ACT III.,"The dates of their despair, the brief words of"
7543,ACT III.,A grief too great for many. This stone page
7544,ACT III.,Holds like an epitaph their history;                                20
7545,ACT III.,And the poor captive's tale is graven on
7546,ACT III.,"His dungeon barrier, like the lover's record"
7547,ACT III.,"Upon the bark of some tall tree,[60] which bears"
7548,ACT III.,His own and his belovéd's name. Alas!
7549,ACT III.,"I recognise some names familiar to me,"
7550,ACT III.,"And blighted like to mine, which I will add,"
7551,ACT III.,"Fittest for such a chronicle as this,"
7552,ACT III.,"Which only can be read, as writ, by wretches.[bk]"
7553,ACT III.,[_He engraves his name_.
7554,ACT III.,
7555,ACT III.,"_Enter a Familiar of ""the Ten.""_"
7556,ACT III.,
7557,ACT III.,_Fam._ I bring you food.
7558,ACT III.,
7559,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._             I pray you set it down;
7560,ACT III.,I am past hunger: but my lips are parched--                         30
7561,ACT III.,The water!
7562,ACT III.,
7563,ACT III.,_Fam._    There.
7564,ACT III.,
7565,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ (_after drinking_). I thank you: I am better.
7566,ACT III.,
7567,ACT III.,_Fam._ I am commanded to inform you that
7568,ACT III.,Your further trial is postponed.
7569,ACT III.,
7570,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                     Till when?
7571,ACT III.,
7572,ACT III.,_Fam._ I know not.--It is also in my orders
7573,ACT III.,That your illustrious lady be admitted.
7574,ACT III.,
7575,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ Ah! they relent, then--I had ceased to hope it:"
7576,ACT III.,'Twas time.
7577,ACT III.,
7578,ACT III.,_Enter_ MARINA.
7579,ACT III.,
7580,ACT III.,_Mar._     My best belovéd!
7581,ACT III.,
7582,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ (_embracing her_). My true wife,"
7583,ACT III.,And only friend! What happiness!
7584,ACT III.,
7585,ACT III.,_Mar._                       We'll part
7586,ACT III.,No more.
7587,ACT III.,
7588,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ How! would'st thou share a dungeon?
7589,ACT III.,
7590,ACT III.,"_Mar._                                         Aye,"
7591,ACT III.,"The rack, the grave, all--any thing with thee,                      40"
7592,ACT III.,"But the tomb last of all, for there we shall"
7593,ACT III.,"Be ignorant of each other, yet I will"
7594,ACT III.,Share that--all things except new separation;
7595,ACT III.,It is too much to have survived the first.
7596,ACT III.,How dost thou? How are those worn limbs? Alas!
7597,ACT III.,Why do I ask? Thy paleness----
7598,ACT III.,
7599,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._               'Tis the joy
7600,ACT III.,"Of seeing thee again so soon, and so"
7601,ACT III.,"Without expectancy, has sent the blood"

7604,ACT III.,
7605,ACT III.,_Mar._                           'Tis                              50
7606,ACT III.,"The gloom of this eternal cell, which never"
7607,ACT III.,"Knew sunbeam, and the sallow sullen glare"
7608,ACT III.,"Of the familiar's torch, which seems akin[bl]"
7609,ACT III.,"To darkness more than light, by lending to"
7610,ACT III.,"The dungeon vapours its bituminous smoke,"
7611,ACT III.,"Which cloud whate'er we gaze on, even thine eyes--"
7612,ACT III.,"No, not thine eyes--they sparkle--how they sparkle!"
7613,ACT III.,
7614,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ And thine!--but I am blinded by the torch.
7615,ACT III.,
7616,ACT III.,_Mar._ As I had been without it. Couldst thou see here?
7617,ACT III.,
7618,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ Nothing at first; but use and time had taught me        60
7619,ACT III.,Familiarity with what was darkness;
7620,ACT III.,And the grey twilight of such glimmerings as
7621,ACT III.,Glide through the crevices made by the winds
7622,ACT III.,"Was kinder to mine eyes than the full Sun,"
7623,ACT III.,When gorgeously o'ergilding any towers
7624,ACT III.,Save those of Venice; but a moment ere
7625,ACT III.,Thou earnest hither I was busy writing.
7626,ACT III.,
7627,ACT III.,_Mar._ What?
7628,ACT III.,
7629,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._   My name: look, 'tis there--recorded next"
7630,ACT III.,"The name of him who here preceded me,--"
7631,ACT III.,If dungeon dates say true.
7632,ACT III.,
7633,ACT III.,_Mar._                    And what of him?                          70
7634,ACT III.,
7635,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ These walls are silent of men's ends; they only
7636,ACT III.,Seem to hint shrewdly of them. Such stern walls
7637,ACT III.,"Were never piled on high save o'er the dead,"
7638,ACT III.,Or those who soon must be so.--_What of him?_
7639,ACT III.,"Thou askest.--What of me? may soon be asked,"
7640,ACT III.,With the like answer--doubt and dreadful surmise--
7641,ACT III.,Unless thou tell'st my tale.
7642,ACT III.,
7643,ACT III.,_Mar._                     _I speak_ of thee!
7644,ACT III.,
7645,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ And wherefore not? All then shall speak of me:
7646,ACT III.,"The tyranny of silence is not lasting,"
7647,ACT III.,"And, though events be hidden, just men's groans                     80"
7648,ACT III.,"Will burst all cerement, even a living grave's!"
7649,ACT III.,"I do not _doubt_ my memory, but my life;"
7650,ACT III.,And neither do I fear.
7651,ACT III.,
7652,ACT III.,_Mar._                Thy life is safe.
7653,ACT III.,
7654,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ And liberty?
7655,ACT III.,
7656,ACT III.,_Mar._                  The mind should make its own!
7657,ACT III.,
7658,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ That has a noble sound; but 'tis a sound,"
7659,ACT III.,"A music most impressive, but too transient:"
7660,ACT III.,"The Mind is much, but is not all. The Mind"
7661,ACT III.,"Hath nerved me to endure the risk of death,"
7662,ACT III.,"And torture positive, far worse than death"
7663,ACT III.,"(If death be a deep sleep), without a groan,                        90"
7664,ACT III.,Or with a cry which rather shamed my judges
7665,ACT III.,"Than me; but 'tis not all, for there are things"
7666,ACT III.,"More woful--such as this small dungeon, where"
7667,ACT III.,I may breathe many years.
7668,ACT III.,
7669,ACT III.,_Mar._                 Alas! and this
7670,ACT III.,Small dungeon is all that belongs to thee
7671,ACT III.,"Of this wide realm, of which thy sire is Prince."
7672,ACT III.,
7673,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ That thought would scarcely aid me to endure it.
7674,ACT III.,"My doom is common; many are in dungeons,"
7675,ACT III.,"But none like mine, so near their father's palace;"
7676,ACT III.,"But then my heart is sometimes high, and hope                      100"
7677,ACT III.,Will stream along those moted rays of light
7678,ACT III.,"Peopled with dusty atoms, which afford"
7679,ACT III.,"Our only day; for, save the gaoler's torch,"
7680,ACT III.,"And a strange firefly, which was quickly caught"
7681,ACT III.,"Last night in yon enormous spider's net,"
7682,ACT III.,I ne'er saw aught here like a ray. Alas!
7683,ACT III.,"I know if mind may bear us up, or no,"
7684,ACT III.,"For I have such, and shown it before men;"
7685,ACT III.,It sinks in solitude: my soul is social.
7686,ACT III.,
7687,ACT III.,_Mar._ I will be with thee.
7688,ACT III.,
7689,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._              Ah! if it were so!                        110
7690,ACT III.,"But _that_ they never granted--nor will grant,"
7691,ACT III.,And I shall be alone: no men; no books--
7692,ACT III.,Those lying likenesses of lying men.
7693,ACT III.,"I asked for even those outlines of their kind,"
7694,ACT III.,"Which they term annals, history, what you will,"
7695,ACT III.,"Which men bequeath as portraits, and they were"
7696,ACT III.,"Refused me,--so these walls have been my study,"
7697,ACT III.,"More faithful pictures of Venetian story,"
7698,ACT III.,"With all their blank, or dismal stains, than is"
7699,ACT III.,"The Hall not far from hence, which bears on high                   120"
7700,ACT III.,"Hundreds of Doges, and their deeds and dates."
7701,ACT III.,
7702,ACT III.,_Mar._ I come to tell thee the result of their
7703,ACT III.,Last council on thy doom.
7704,ACT III.,
7705,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._            I know it--look!
7706,ACT III.,
7707,ACT III.,"[_He points to his limbs, as referring to the Question"
7708,ACT III.,which he had undergone_.
7709,ACT III.,
7710,ACT III.,_Mar._ No--no--no more of that: even they relent
7711,ACT III.,From that atrocity.
7712,ACT III.,
7713,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._      What then?
7714,ACT III.,
7715,ACT III.,_Mar._                       That you
7716,ACT III.,Return to Candia.
7717,ACT III.,
7718,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._      Then my last hope's gone.
7719,ACT III.,"I could endure my dungeon, for 'twas Venice;"
7720,ACT III.,"I could support the torture, there was something"
7721,ACT III.,In my native air that buoyed my spirits up
7722,ACT III.,"Like a ship on the Ocean tossed by storms,                         130"
7723,ACT III.,"But proudly still bestriding[61] the high waves,"
7724,ACT III.,"And holding on its course; but _there_, afar,"
7725,ACT III.,"In that accurséd isle of slaves and captives,"
7726,ACT III.,"And unbelievers, like a stranded wreck,"
7727,ACT III.,"My very soul seemed mouldering in my bosom,"
7728,ACT III.,"And piecemeal I shall perish, if remanded."
7729,ACT III.,
7730,ACT III.,_Mar._ And _here_?
7731,ACT III.,
7732,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._         At once--by better means, as briefer.[bm]"
7733,ACT III.,"What! would they even deny me my Sire's sepulchre,"
7734,ACT III.,As well as home and heritage?
7735,ACT III.,
7736,ACT III.,_Mar._                       My husband!
7737,ACT III.,"I have sued to accompany thee hence,                               140"
7738,ACT III.,And not so hopelessly. This love of thine
7739,ACT III.,For an ungrateful and tyrannic soil
7740,ACT III.,"Is Passion, and not Patriotism; for me,"
7741,ACT III.,"So I could see thee with a quiet aspect,"
7742,ACT III.,"And the sweet freedom of the earth and air,"
7743,ACT III.,I would not cavil about climes or regions.
7744,ACT III.,This crowd of palaces and prisons is not
7745,ACT III.,A Paradise; its first inhabitants
7746,ACT III.,Were wretched exiles.
7747,ACT III.,
7748,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._           Well I know _how_ wretched!
7749,ACT III.,
7750,ACT III.,"_Mar._ And yet you see how, from their banishment                  150"
7751,ACT III.,"Before the Tartar into these salt isles,"
7752,ACT III.,"Their antique energy of mind, all that"
7753,ACT III.,"Remained of Rome for their inheritance,"
7754,ACT III.,Created by degrees an ocean Rome;[62]
7755,ACT III.,"And shall an evil, which so often leads"
7756,ACT III.,"To good, depress thee thus?"
7757,ACT III.,
7758,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                Had I gone forth
7759,ACT III.,"From my own land, like the old patriarchs, seeking"
7760,ACT III.,"Another region, with their flocks and herds;"
7761,ACT III.,"Had I been cast out like the Jews from Zion,"
7762,ACT III.,"Or like our fathers, driven by Attila[63]                          160"
7763,ACT III.,"From fertile Italy, to barren islets,"
7764,ACT III.,I would have given some tears to my late country
7765,ACT III.,And many thoughts; but afterwards addressed
7766,ACT III.,"Myself, with those about me, to create"
7767,ACT III.,A new home and fresh state: perhaps I could
7768,ACT III.,Have borne this--though I know not.
7769,ACT III.,
7770,ACT III.,_Mar._                             Wherefore not?
7771,ACT III.,"It was the lot of millions, and must be"
7772,ACT III.,The fate of myriads more.
7773,ACT III.,
7774,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._              Aye--we but hear
7775,ACT III.,"Of the survivors' toil in their new lands,"
7776,ACT III.,Their numbers and success; but who can number                      170
7777,ACT III.,"The hearts which broke in silence at that parting,"
7778,ACT III.,Or after their departure; of that malady[64]
7779,ACT III.,Which calls up green and native fields to view
7780,ACT III.,"From the rough deep, with such identity"
7781,ACT III.,"To the poor exile's fevered eye, that he"
7782,ACT III.,Can scarcely be restrained from treading them?
7783,ACT III.,"That melody,[65] which out of tones and tunes[bn]"
7784,ACT III.,Collects such pasture for the longing sorrow
7785,ACT III.,"Of the sad mountaineer, when far away"
7786,ACT III.,"From his snow canopy of cliffs and clouds,                         180"
7787,ACT III.,"That he feeds on the sweet, but poisonous thought,"
7788,ACT III.,"And dies.[66] You call this _weakness_! It is strength,"
7789,ACT III.,"I say,--the parent of all honest feeling."
7790,ACT III.,"He who loves not his Country, can love nothing."
7791,ACT III.,
7792,ACT III.,"_Mar._ Obey her, then: 'tis she that puts thee forth."
7793,ACT III.,
7794,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ Aye, there it is; 'tis like a mother's curse"
7795,ACT III.,Upon my soul--the mark is set upon me.
7796,ACT III.,"The exiles you speak of went forth by nations,"
7797,ACT III.,"Their hands upheld each other by the way,"
7798,ACT III.,Their tents were pitched together--I'm alone.                      190
7799,ACT III.,
7800,ACT III.,_Mar._ You shall be so no more--I will go with thee.
7801,ACT III.,
7802,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ My best Marina!--and our children?
7803,ACT III.,
7804,ACT III.,"_Mar._                                        They,"
7805,ACT III.,"I fear, by the prevention of the state's"
7806,ACT III.,"Abhorrent policy, (which holds all ties"
7807,ACT III.,"As threads, which may be broken at her pleasure),"
7808,ACT III.,Will not be suffered to proceed with us.
7809,ACT III.,
7810,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ And canst thou leave them?
7811,ACT III.,
7812,ACT III.,_Mar._                                Yes--with many a pang!
7813,ACT III.,"But--I _can_ leave them, children as they are,"
7814,ACT III.,To teach you to be less a child. From this
7815,ACT III.,"Learn you to sway your feelings, when exacted                      200"
7816,ACT III.,By duties paramount; and 'tis our first
7817,ACT III.,On earth to bear.
7818,ACT III.,
7819,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._      Have I not borne?
7820,ACT III.,
7821,ACT III.,_Mar._                            Too much
7822,ACT III.,"From tyrannous injustice, and enough"
7823,ACT III.,"To teach you not to shrink now from a lot,"
7824,ACT III.,"Which, as compared with what you have undergone"
7825,ACT III.,"Of late, is mercy."
7826,ACT III.,
7827,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._       Ah! you never yet
7828,ACT III.,"Were far away from Venice, never saw"
7829,ACT III.,"Her beautiful towers in the receding distance,"
7830,ACT III.,While every furrow of the vessel's track
7831,ACT III.,Seemed ploughing deep into your heart; you never                   210
7832,ACT III.,Saw day go down upon your native spires[bo]
7833,ACT III.,"So calmly with its gold and crimson glory,"
7834,ACT III.,And after dreaming a disturbéd vision
7835,ACT III.,"Of them and theirs, awoke and found them not."
7836,ACT III.,
7837,ACT III.,_Mar._ I will divide this with you. Let us think
7838,ACT III.,"Of our departure from this much-loved city,"
7839,ACT III.,"(Since you must _love_ it, as it seems,) and this"
7840,ACT III.,"Chamber of state, her gratitude allots you."
7841,ACT III.,"Our children will be cared for by the Doge,"
7842,ACT III.,And by my uncles; we must sail ere night.                          220
7843,ACT III.,
7844,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ That's sudden. Shall I not behold my father?
7845,ACT III.,
7846,ACT III.,_Mar._ You will.
7847,ACT III.,
7848,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._     Where?
7849,ACT III.,
7850,ACT III.,"_Mar._                Here, or in the ducal chamber--"
7851,ACT III.,He said not which. I would that you could bear
7852,ACT III.,Your exile as he bears it.
7853,ACT III.,
7854,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._               Blame him not.
7855,ACT III.,I sometimes murmur for a moment; but
7856,ACT III.,He could not now act otherwise. A show
7857,ACT III.,Of feeling or compassion on his part
7858,ACT III.,Would have but drawn upon his agéd head
7859,ACT III.,"Suspicion from ""the Ten,"" and upon mine"
7860,ACT III.,Accumulated ills.
7861,ACT III.,
7862,ACT III.,_Mar._           Accumulated!                                      230
7863,ACT III.,What pangs are those they have spared you?
7864,ACT III.,
7865,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                               That of leaving
7866,ACT III.,"Venice without beholding him or you,"
7867,ACT III.,"Which might have been forbidden now, as 'twas"
7868,ACT III.,Upon my former exile.
7869,ACT III.,
7870,ACT III.,"_Mar._               That is true,"
7871,ACT III.,"And thus far I am also the State's debtor,"
7872,ACT III.,And shall be more so when I see us both
7873,ACT III.,Floating on the free waves--away--away--
7874,ACT III.,"Be it to the earth's end, from this abhorred,"
7875,ACT III.,"Unjust, and----"
7876,ACT III.,
7877,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._    Curse it not. If I am silent,"
7878,ACT III.,Who dares accuse my Country?
7879,ACT III.,
7880,ACT III.,_Mar._                     Men and Angels!                         240
7881,ACT III.,"The blood of myriads reeking up to Heaven,"
7882,ACT III.,"The groans of slaves in chains, and men in dungeons,"
7883,ACT III.,"Mothers, and wives, and sons, and sires, and subjects,"
7884,ACT III.,Held in the bondage of ten bald-heads; and
7885,ACT III.,"Though last, not least, _thy silence! Couldst thou_ say"
7886,ACT III.,"Aught in its favour, who would praise like _thee_?"
7887,ACT III.,
7888,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ Let us address us then, since so it must be,"
7889,ACT III.,To our departure. Who comes here?
7890,ACT III.,
7891,ACT III.,_Enter_ LOREDANO _attended by Familiars_.
7892,ACT III.,
7893,ACT III.,"_Lor._ (_to the Familiars_).       Retire,"
7894,ACT III.,But leave the torch.                      [_Exeunt the two Familiars_.
7895,ACT III.,
7896,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._         Most welcome, noble Signor."
7897,ACT III.,I did not deem this poor place could have drawn                    250
7898,ACT III.,Such presence hither.
7899,ACT III.,
7900,ACT III.,_Lor._               'Tis not the first time
7901,ACT III.,I have visited these places.
7902,ACT III.,
7903,ACT III.,_Mar._                      Nor would be
7904,ACT III.,"The last, were all men's merits well rewarded."
7905,ACT III.,"Came you here to insult us, or remain[bp]"
7906,ACT III.,"As spy upon us, or as hostage for us?"
7907,ACT III.,
7908,ACT III.,"_Lor._ Neither are of my office, noble Lady!"
7909,ACT III.,"I am sent hither to your husband, to"
7910,ACT III.,"Announce ""the Ten's"" decree."
7911,ACT III.,
7912,ACT III.,_Mar._                      That tenderness
7913,ACT III.,Has been anticipated: it is known.
7914,ACT III.,
7915,ACT III.,_Lor._ As how?
7916,ACT III.,
7917,ACT III.,"_Mar._         I have informed him, not so gently,                 260"
7918,ACT III.,"Doubtless, as your nice feelings would prescribe,"
7919,ACT III.,The indulgence of your colleagues; but he knew it.
7920,ACT III.,"If you come for our thanks, take them, and hence!"
7921,ACT III.,"The dungeon gloom is deep enough without you,"
7922,ACT III.,"And full of reptiles, not less loathsome, though"
7923,ACT III.,Their sting is honester.
7924,ACT III.,
7925,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._             I pray you, calm you:"
7926,ACT III.,What can avail such words?
7927,ACT III.,
7928,ACT III.,_Mar._                   To let him know
7929,ACT III.,That he is known.
7930,ACT III.,
7931,ACT III.,_Lor._           Let the fair dame preserve
7932,ACT III.,Her sex's privilege.
7933,ACT III.,
7934,ACT III.,"_Mar._              I have some sons, sir,"
7935,ACT III.,Will one day thank you better.
7936,ACT III.,
7937,ACT III.,_Lor._                        You do well                          270
7938,ACT III.,To nurse them wisely. Foscari--you know
7939,ACT III.,"Your sentence, then?"
7940,ACT III.,
7941,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._        Return to Candia?
7942,ACT III.,
7943,ACT III.,_Lor._                               True--
7944,ACT III.,For life.
7945,ACT III.,
7946,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ Not long.
7947,ACT III.,
7948,ACT III.,_Lor._               I said--for _life_.
7949,ACT III.,
7950,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                              And I
7951,ACT III.,Repeat--not long.
7952,ACT III.,
7953,ACT III.,_Lor._        A year's imprisonment
7954,ACT III.,In Canea--afterwards the freedom of
7955,ACT III.,The whole isle.
7956,ACT III.,
7957,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._      Both the same to me: the after
7958,ACT III.,Freedom as is the first imprisonment.
7959,ACT III.,Is't true my wife accompanies me?
7960,ACT III.,
7961,ACT III.,"_Lor._                           Yes,"
7962,ACT III.,If she so wills it.
7963,ACT III.,
7964,ACT III.,_Mar._             Who obtained that justice?
7965,ACT III.,
7966,ACT III.,_Lor._ One who wars not with women.
7967,ACT III.,
7968,ACT III.,_Mar._                              But oppresses                  280
7969,ACT III.,Men: howsoever let him have _my_ thanks
7970,ACT III.,For the only boon I would have asked or taken
7971,ACT III.,From him or such as he is.
7972,ACT III.,
7973,ACT III.,_Lor._                     He receives them
7974,ACT III.,As they are offered.
7975,ACT III.,
7976,ACT III.,_Mar._              May they thrive with him
7977,ACT III.,So much!--no more.
7978,ACT III.,
7979,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._        Is this, sir, your whole mission?"
7980,ACT III.,"Because we have brief time for preparation,"
7981,ACT III.,And you perceive your presence doth disquiet
7982,ACT III.,"This lady, of a house noble as yours."
7983,ACT III.,
7984,ACT III.,_Mar._ Nobler!
7985,ACT III.,
7986,ACT III.,_Lor._          How nobler?
7987,ACT III.,
7988,ACT III.,_Mar._                     As more generous!
7989,ACT III.,"We say the ""generous steed"" to express the purity 290"
7990,ACT III.,"Of his high blood. Thus much I've learnt, although"
7991,ACT III.,"Venetian (who see few steeds save of bronze),[67]"
7992,ACT III.,From those Venetians who have skirred[68] the coasts
7993,ACT III.,Of Egypt and her neighbour Araby:
7994,ACT III.,"And why not say as soon the ""_generous man_?"""
7995,ACT III.,"If race be aught, it is in qualities"
7996,ACT III.,"More than in years; and mine, which is as old"
7997,ACT III.,"As yours, is better in its product, nay--"
7998,ACT III.,"Look not so stern--but get you back, and pore"
7999,ACT III.,Upon your genealogic tree's most green                             300
8000,ACT III.,"Of leaves and most mature of fruits, and there"
8001,ACT III.,"Blush to find ancestors, who would have blushed"
8002,ACT III.,For such a son--thou cold inveterate hater!
8003,ACT III.,
8004,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ Again, Marina!"
8005,ACT III.,
8006,ACT III.,"_Mar._                       Again! _still_, Marina."
8007,ACT III.,"See you not, he comes here to glut his hate"
8008,ACT III.,With a last look upon our misery?
8009,ACT III.,Let him partake it!
8010,ACT III.,
8011,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._       That were difficult.
8012,ACT III.,
8013,ACT III.,_Mar._ Nothing more easy. He partakes it now--
8014,ACT III.,"Aye, he may veil beneath a marble brow"
8015,ACT III.,"And sneering lip the pang, but he partakes it.                     310"
8016,ACT III.,A few brief words of truth shame the Devil's servants
8017,ACT III.,No less than Master; I have probed his soul
8018,ACT III.,"A moment, as the Eternal Fire, ere long,"
8019,ACT III.,Will reach it always. See how he shrinks from me!
8020,ACT III.,"With death, and chains, and exile in his hand,"
8021,ACT III.,To scatter o'er his kind as he thinks fit;
8022,ACT III.,"They are his weapons, not his armour, for"
8023,ACT III.,I have pierced him to the core of his cold heart.
8024,ACT III.,"I care not for his frowns! We can but die,"
8025,ACT III.,"And he but live, for him the very worst                            320"
8026,ACT III.,Of destinies: each day secures him more
8027,ACT III.,His tempter's.
8028,ACT III.,
8029,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._     This is mere insanity.
8030,ACT III.,
8031,ACT III.,_Mar._ It may be so; and _who_ hath made us _mad_?
8032,ACT III.,
8033,ACT III.,_Lor._ Let her go on; it irks not me.
8034,ACT III.,
8035,ACT III.,_Mar._                                 That's false!
8036,ACT III.,You came here to enjoy a heartless triumph
8037,ACT III.,Of cold looks upon manifold griefs! You came
8038,ACT III.,"To be sued to in vain--to mark our tears,"
8039,ACT III.,And hoard our groans--to gaze upon the wreck
8040,ACT III.,Which you have made a Prince's son--my husband;
8041,ACT III.,"In short, to trample on the fallen--an office                      330"
8042,ACT III.,"The hangman shrinks from, as all men from him!"
8043,ACT III.,"How have you sped? We are wretched, Signor, as"
8044,ACT III.,"Your plots could make, and vengeance could desire us,"
8045,ACT III.,And how _feel you_?
8046,ACT III.,
8047,ACT III.,_Lor._             As rocks.
8048,ACT III.,
8049,ACT III.,_Mar._                       By thunder blasted:
8050,ACT III.,"They feel not, but no less are shivered. Come,"
8051,ACT III.,"Foscari; now let us go, and leave this felon,"
8052,ACT III.,"The sole fit habitant of such a cell,"
8053,ACT III.,"Which he has peopled often, but ne'er fitly"
8054,ACT III.,Till he himself shall brood in it alone.
8055,ACT III.,
8056,ACT III.,_Enter the_ DOGE.
8057,ACT III.,
8058,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ My father!
8059,ACT III.,
8060,ACT III.,_Doge_ (_embracing him_). Jacopo! my son--my son!                  340
8061,ACT III.,
8062,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ My father still! How long it is since I
8063,ACT III.,Have heard thee name my name--_our_ name!
8064,ACT III.,
8065,ACT III.,_Doge_.                                  My boy!
8066,ACT III.,Couldst thou but know----
8067,ACT III.,
8068,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._               I rarely, sir, have murmured."
8069,ACT III.,
8070,ACT III.,_Doge_. I feel too much thou hast not.
8071,ACT III.,
8072,ACT III.,"_Mar._                                Doge, look there!"
8073,ACT III.,[_She points to_ LOREDANO.
8074,ACT III.,
8075,ACT III.,_Doge_. I see the man--what mean'st thou?
8076,ACT III.,
8077,ACT III.,_Mar._                                   Caution!
8078,ACT III.,
8079,ACT III.,_Lor._                                            Being
8080,ACT III.,The virtue which this noble lady most[bq]
8081,ACT III.,"May practise, she doth well to recommend it."
8082,ACT III.,
8083,ACT III.,"_Mar._ Wretch! 'tis no virtue, but the policy"
8084,ACT III.,Of those who fain must deal perforce with vice:
8085,ACT III.,"As such I recommend it, as I would                                 350"
8086,ACT III.,To one whose foot was on an adder's path.
8087,ACT III.,
8088,ACT III.,"_Doge_. Daughter, it is superfluous; I have long"
8089,ACT III.,Known Loredano.
8090,ACT III.,
8091,ACT III.,_Lor._         You may know him better.
8092,ACT III.,
8093,ACT III.,_Mar._ Yes; _worse_ he could not.
8094,ACT III.,
8095,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._                      Father, let not these"
8096,ACT III.,Our parting hours be lost in listening to
8097,ACT III.,"Reproaches, which boot nothing. Is it--is it,"
8098,ACT III.,"Indeed, our last of meetings?"
8099,ACT III.,
8100,ACT III.,_Doge_.                      You behold
8101,ACT III.,These white hairs!
8102,ACT III.,
8103,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._     And I feel, besides, that mine"
8104,ACT III.,"Will never be so white. Embrace me, father!"
8105,ACT III.,I loved you ever--never more than now.                             360
8106,ACT III.,Look to my children--to your last child's children:
8107,ACT III.,"Let them be all to you which he was once,"
8108,ACT III.,And never be to you what I am now.
8109,ACT III.,May I not see _them_ also?
8110,ACT III.,
8111,ACT III.,_Mar._                    No--not _here_.
8112,ACT III.,
8113,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ They might behold their parent any where.
8114,ACT III.,
8115,ACT III.,_Mar._ I would that they beheld their father in
8116,ACT III.,"A place which would not mingle fear with love,"
8117,ACT III.,To freeze their young blood in its natural current.
8118,ACT III.,"They have fed well, slept soft, and knew not that"
8119,ACT III.,"Their sire was a mere hunted outlaw. Well,                         370"
8120,ACT III.,"I know his fate may one day be their heritage,"
8121,ACT III.,"But let it only be their _heritage_,"
8122,ACT III.,"And not their present fee. Their senses, though"
8123,ACT III.,"Alive to love, are yet awake to terror;"
8124,ACT III.,"And these vile damps, too, and yon _thick green_ wave"
8125,ACT III.,Which floats above the place where we now stand--
8126,ACT III.,"A cell so far below the water's level,"
8127,ACT III.,"Sending its pestilence through every crevice,"
8128,ACT III.,"Might strike them: _this is not their_ atmosphere,"
8129,ACT III.,"However you--and you--and most of all,                             380"
8130,ACT III.,"As worthiest--_you_, sir, noble Loredano!"
8131,ACT III.,May breathe it without prejudice.
8132,ACT III.,
8133,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                      I had not
8134,ACT III.,"Reflected upon this, but acquiesce."
8135,ACT III.,"I shall depart, then, without meeting them?"
8136,ACT III.,
8137,ACT III.,_Doge_. Not so: they shall await you in my chamber.
8138,ACT III.,
8139,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ And must I leave them--_all_?
8140,ACT III.,
8141,ACT III.,_Lor._                                    You must.
8142,ACT III.,
8143,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                                         Not one?
8144,ACT III.,
8145,ACT III.,_Lor._ They are the State's.
8146,ACT III.,
8147,ACT III.,_Mar._                      I thought they had been mine.
8148,ACT III.,
8149,ACT III.,"_Lor._ They are, in all maternal things."
8150,ACT III.,
8151,ACT III.,"_Mar._                                   That is,"
8152,ACT III.,"In all things painful. If they're sick, they will"
8153,ACT III.,"Be left to me to tend them; should they die,                       390"
8154,ACT III.,To me to bury and to mourn; but if
8155,ACT III.,"They live, they'll make you soldiers, senators,"
8156,ACT III.,"Slaves, exiles--what _you_ will; or if they are"
8157,ACT III.,"Females with portions, brides and _bribes_ for nobles!"
8158,ACT III.,Behold the State's care for its sons and mothers!
8159,ACT III.,
8160,ACT III.,"_Lor._ The hour approaches, and the wind is fair."
8161,ACT III.,
8162,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ How know you that here, where the genial wind"
8163,ACT III.,Ne'er blows in all its blustering freedom?
8164,ACT III.,
8165,ACT III.,_Lor._                                 'Twas so
8166,ACT III.,When I came here. The galley floats within
8167,ACT III.,"A bow-shot of the ""Riva di Schiavoni."" 400"
8168,ACT III.,
8169,ACT III.,"_Jac. Fos._ Father! I pray you to precede me, and"
8170,ACT III.,Prepare my children to behold their father.
8171,ACT III.,
8172,ACT III.,"_Doge_. Be firm, my son!"
8173,ACT III.,
8174,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._             I will do my endeavour.
8175,ACT III.,
8176,ACT III.,"_Mar._ Farewell! at least to this detested dungeon,"
8177,ACT III.,And him to whose good offices you owe
8178,ACT III.,In part your past imprisonment.
8179,ACT III.,
8180,ACT III.,_Lor._                         And present
8181,ACT III.,Liberation.
8182,ACT III.,
8183,ACT III.,_Doge_.    He speaks truth.
8184,ACT III.,
8185,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                No doubt! but 'tis
8186,ACT III.,Exchange of chains for heavier chains I owe him.
8187,ACT III.,"He knows this, or he had not sought to change them,"
8188,ACT III.,But I reproach not.
8189,ACT III.,
8190,ACT III.,"_Lor._           The time narrows, Signor.                         410"
8191,ACT III.,
8192,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._ Alas! I little thought so lingeringly
8193,ACT III.,To leave abodes like this: but when I feel
8194,ACT III.,"That every step I take, even from this cell,"
8195,ACT III.,"Is one away from Venice, I look back"
8196,ACT III.,"Even on these dull damp walls, and----"
8197,ACT III.,
8198,ACT III.,_Doge_.                               Boy! no tears.
8199,ACT III.,
8200,ACT III.,_Mar._ Let them flow on: he wept not on the rack
8201,ACT III.,"To shame him, and they cannot shame him now."
8202,ACT III.,They will relieve his heart--that too kind heart--
8203,ACT III.,And I will find an hour to wipe away
8204,ACT III.,"Those tears, or add my own. I could weep now,                      420"
8205,ACT III.,But would not gratify yon wretch so far.
8206,ACT III.,"Let us proceed. Doge, lead the way."
8207,ACT III.,
8208,ACT III.,"_Lor._ (_to the Familiar_).        The torch, there!"
8209,ACT III.,
8210,ACT III.,"_Mar._ Yes, light us on, as to a funeral pyre,"
8211,ACT III.,With Loredano mourning like an heir.
8212,ACT III.,
8213,ACT III.,"_Doge_. My son, you are feeble; take this hand."
8214,ACT III.,
8215,ACT III.,_Jac. Fos._                                    Alas!
8216,ACT III.,"Must youth support itself on age, and I"
8217,ACT III.,Who ought to be the prop of yours?
8218,ACT III.,
8219,ACT III.,_Lor._                            Take mine.
8220,ACT III.,
8221,ACT III.,"_Mar._ Touch it not, Foscari; 'twill sting you. Signor,"
8222,ACT III.,"Stand off! be sure, that if a grasp of yours"
8223,ACT III.,"Would raise us from the gulf wherein we are plunged,               430"
8224,ACT III.,No hand of ours would stretch itself to meet it.
8225,ACT III.,"Come, Foscari, take the hand the altar gave you;"
8226,ACT III.,"It could not save, but will support you ever.               [_Exeunt_."
8227,ACT III.,
8228,ACT III.,
8229,ACT III.,
8230,ACT III.,
8231,ACT IV.,ACT IV.
8232,ACT IV.,
8233,ACT IV.,SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Ducal Palace_.
8234,ACT IV.,
8235,ACT IV.,_Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.
8236,ACT IV.,
8237,ACT IV.,_Bar._ And have you confidence in such a project?
8238,ACT IV.,
8239,ACT IV.,_Lor._ I have.
8240,ACT IV.,
8241,ACT IV.,_Bar._         'Tis hard upon his years.
8242,ACT IV.,
8243,ACT IV.,_Lor._                                  Say rather
8244,ACT IV.,Kind to relieve him from the cares of State.
8245,ACT IV.,
8246,ACT IV.,_Bar._ 'Twill break his heart.
8247,ACT IV.,
8248,ACT IV.,_Lor._                        Age has no heart to break.
8249,ACT IV.,"He has seen his son's half broken, and, except"
8250,ACT IV.,"A start of feeling in his dungeon, never"
8251,ACT IV.,Swerved.
8252,ACT IV.,
8253,ACT IV.,"_Bar._   In his countenance, I grant you, never;"
8254,ACT IV.,But I have seen him sometimes in a calm
8255,ACT IV.,"So desolate, that the most clamorous grief"
8256,ACT IV.,Had nought to envy him within. Where is he?                         10
8257,ACT IV.,
8258,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ In his own portion of the palace, with"
8259,ACT IV.,"His son, and the whole race of Foscaris."
8260,ACT IV.,
8261,ACT IV.,_Bar._ Bidding farewell.
8262,ACT IV.,
8263,ACT IV.,"_Lor._                   A last! as, soon, he shall"
8264,ACT IV.,Bid to his Dukedom.
8265,ACT IV.,
8266,ACT IV.,_Bar._             When embarks the son?
8267,ACT IV.,
8268,ACT IV.,_Lor._ Forthwith--when this long leave is taken. 'Tis
8269,ACT IV.,Time to admonish them again.
8270,ACT IV.,
8271,ACT IV.,_Bar._                      Forbear;
8272,ACT IV.,Retrench not from their moments.
8273,ACT IV.,
8274,ACT IV.,"_Lor._                          Not I, now"
8275,ACT IV.,We have higher business for our own. This day
8276,ACT IV.,"Shall be the last of the old Doge's reign,"
8277,ACT IV.,"As the first of his son's last banishment,                          20"
8278,ACT IV.,And that is vengeance.
8279,ACT IV.,
8280,ACT IV.,"_Bar._                In my mind, too deep."
8281,ACT IV.,
8282,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ 'Tis moderate--not even life for life, the rule"
8283,ACT IV.,Denounced of retribution from all time;
8284,ACT IV.,They owe me still my father's and my uncle's.
8285,ACT IV.,
8286,ACT IV.,_Bar._ Did not the Doge deny this strongly?
8287,ACT IV.,
8288,ACT IV.,_Lor._                                      Doubtless.
8289,ACT IV.,
8290,ACT IV.,_Bar._ And did not this shake your suspicion?
8291,ACT IV.,
8292,ACT IV.,_Lor._                                        No.
8293,ACT IV.,
8294,ACT IV.,_Bar._ But if this deposition should take place
8295,ACT IV.,"By our united influence in the Council,"
8296,ACT IV.,It must be done with all the deference
8297,ACT IV.,"Due to his years, his station, and his deeds.                       30"
8298,ACT IV.,
8299,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ As much of ceremony as you will,"
8300,ACT IV.,"So that the thing be done. You may, for aught"
8301,ACT IV.,"I care, depute the Council on their knees,"
8302,ACT IV.,"(Like Barbarossa to the Pope,) to beg him"
8303,ACT IV.,To have the courtesy to abdicate.
8304,ACT IV.,
8305,ACT IV.,_Bar._ What if he will not?
8306,ACT IV.,
8307,ACT IV.,"_Lor._                      We'll elect another,"
8308,ACT IV.,And make him null.
8309,ACT IV.,
8310,ACT IV.,_Bar._            But will the laws uphold us?[69]
8311,ACT IV.,
8312,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ What laws?--""The Ten"" are laws; and if they were not,"
8313,ACT IV.,I will be legislator in this business.
8314,ACT IV.,
8315,ACT IV.,_Bar._ At your own peril?
8316,ACT IV.,
8317,ACT IV.,"_Lor._                   There is none, I tell you,                 40"
8318,ACT IV.,Our powers are such.
8319,ACT IV.,
8320,ACT IV.,_Bar._              But he has twice already
8321,ACT IV.,"Solicited permission to retire,"
8322,ACT IV.,And twice it was refused.
8323,ACT IV.,
8324,ACT IV.,_Lor._                  The better reason
8325,ACT IV.,To grant it the third time.
8326,ACT IV.,
8327,ACT IV.,_Bar._                     Unasked?
8328,ACT IV.,
8329,ACT IV.,_Lor._                             It shows
8330,ACT IV.,The impression of his former instances:
8331,ACT IV.,"If they were from his heart, he may be thankful:"
8332,ACT IV.,"If not, 'twill punish his hypocrisy."
8333,ACT IV.,"Come, they are met by this time; let us join them,"
8334,ACT IV.,And be _thou_ fixed in purpose for this once.
8335,ACT IV.,I have prepared such arguments as will not                          50
8336,ACT IV.,"Fail to move them, and to remove him: since"
8337,ACT IV.,"Their thoughts, their objects, have been sounded, do not"
8338,ACT IV.,"_You_, with your wonted scruples, teach us pause,"
8339,ACT IV.,And all will prosper.
8340,ACT IV.,
8341,ACT IV.,_Bar._               Could I but be certain
8342,ACT IV.,This is no prelude to such persecution
8343,ACT IV.,"Of the sire as has fallen upon the son,"
8344,ACT IV.,I would support you.
8345,ACT IV.,
8346,ACT IV.,"_Lor._              He is safe, I tell you;"
8347,ACT IV.,His fourscore years and five may linger on
8348,ACT IV.,As long as he can drag them: 'tis his throne
8349,ACT IV.,Alone is aimed at.
8350,ACT IV.,
8351,ACT IV.,_Bar._            But discarded Princes                              60
8352,ACT IV.,Are seldom long of life.
8353,ACT IV.,
8354,ACT IV.,_Lor._                  And men of eighty
8355,ACT IV.,More seldom still.
8356,ACT IV.,
8357,ACT IV.,_Bar._            And why not wait these few years?
8358,ACT IV.,
8359,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ Because we have waited long enough, and he"
8360,ACT IV.,Lived longer than enough. Hence! in to council!
8361,ACT IV.,[_Exeunt_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.
8362,ACT IV.,
8363,ACT IV.,_Enter_ MEMMO[70] _and a Senator_.
8364,ACT IV.,
8365,ACT IV.,"_Sen._ A summons to ""the Ten!"" why so?"
8366,ACT IV.,
8367,ACT IV.,"_Mem._                                ""The Ten"""
8368,ACT IV.,Alone can answer; they are rarely wont
8369,ACT IV.,To let their thoughts anticipate their purpose
8370,ACT IV.,By previous proclamation. We are summoned--
8371,ACT IV.,That is enough.
8372,ACT IV.,
8373,ACT IV.,"_Sen._        For them, but not for us;"
8374,ACT IV.,I would know why.
8375,ACT IV.,
8376,ACT IV.,"_Mem._          You will know why anon,                             70"
8377,ACT IV.,"If you obey: and, if not, you no less"
8378,ACT IV.,Will know why you should have obeyed.
8379,ACT IV.,
8380,ACT IV.,_Sen._                               I mean not
8381,ACT IV.,"To oppose them, _but_----"
8382,ACT IV.,
8383,ACT IV.,"_Mem._                  In Venice ""_but_""'s a traitor."
8384,ACT IV.,"But me no ""_buts_"" unless you would pass o'er"
8385,ACT IV.,The Bridge which few repass.[71]
8386,ACT IV.,
8387,ACT IV.,_Sen._                      I am silent.
8388,ACT IV.,
8389,ACT IV.,_Mem._                                   Why
8390,ACT IV.,"Thus hesitate? ""The Ten"" have called in aid"
8391,ACT IV.,Of their deliberation five and twenty
8392,ACT IV.,"Patricians of the Senate--you are one,"
8393,ACT IV.,And I another; and it seems to me
8394,ACT IV.,Both honoured by the choice or chance which leads us                80
8395,ACT IV.,To mingle with a body so august.
8396,ACT IV.,
8397,ACT IV.,_Sen._ Most true. I say no more.
8398,ACT IV.,
8399,ACT IV.,"_Mem._                          As we hope, Signor,"
8400,ACT IV.,"And all may honestly, (that is, all those"
8401,ACT IV.,"Of noble blood may,) one day hope to be"
8402,ACT IV.,"Decemvir, it is surely for the Senate's[br]"
8403,ACT IV.,"Chosen delegates, a school of wisdom, to"
8404,ACT IV.,"Be thus admitted, though as novices,"
8405,ACT IV.,To view the mysteries.
8406,ACT IV.,
8407,ACT IV.,"_Sen._                Let us view them: they,"
8408,ACT IV.,"No doubt, are worth it."
8409,ACT IV.,
8410,ACT IV.,_Mem._                 Being worth our lives
8411,ACT IV.,"If we divulge them, doubtless they are worth                        90"
8412,ACT IV.,"Something, at least to you or me."
8413,ACT IV.,
8414,ACT IV.,_Sen._                           I sought not
8415,ACT IV.,A place within the sanctuary; but being
8416,ACT IV.,"Chosen, however reluctantly so chosen,"
8417,ACT IV.,I shall fulfil my office.
8418,ACT IV.,
8419,ACT IV.,_Mem._                   Let us not
8420,ACT IV.,"Be latest in obeying ""the Ten's"" summons."
8421,ACT IV.,
8422,ACT IV.,"_Sen._ All are not met, but I am of your thought"
8423,ACT IV.,So far--let's in.
8424,ACT IV.,
8425,ACT IV.,_Mem._          The earliest are most welcome
8426,ACT IV.,In earnest councils--we will not be least so.               [_Exeunt_.
8427,ACT IV.,
8428,ACT IV.,"_Enter the_ DOGE, JACOPO FOSCARI, _and_ MARINA."
8429,ACT IV.,
8430,ACT IV.,"_Jac. Fos._ Ah, father! though I must and will depart,"
8431,ACT IV.,Yet--yet--I pray you to obtain for me                              100
8432,ACT IV.,"That I once more return unto my home,"
8433,ACT IV.,Howe'er remote the period. Let there be
8434,ACT IV.,"A point of time, as beacon to my heart,"
8435,ACT IV.,"With any penalty annexed they please,"
8436,ACT IV.,But let me still return.
8437,ACT IV.,
8438,ACT IV.,"_Doge_.                 Son Jacopo,"
8439,ACT IV.,Go and obey our Country's will:[72] 'tis not
8440,ACT IV.,For us to look beyond.
8441,ACT IV.,
8442,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._        But still I must
8443,ACT IV.,Look back. I pray you think of me.
8444,ACT IV.,
8445,ACT IV.,_Doge_.                           Alas!
8446,ACT IV.,"You ever were my dearest offspring, when"
8447,ACT IV.,"They were more numerous, nor can be less so                        110"
8448,ACT IV.,Now you are last; but did the State demand
8449,ACT IV.,The exile of the disinterréd ashes
8450,ACT IV.,"Of your three goodly brothers, now in earth,[73]"
8451,ACT IV.,And their desponding shades came flitting round
8452,ACT IV.,"To impede the act, I must no less obey"
8453,ACT IV.,"A duty, paramount to every duty."
8454,ACT IV.,
8455,ACT IV.,_Mar._ My husband! let us on: this but prolongs
8456,ACT IV.,Our sorrow.
8457,ACT IV.,
8458,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._ But we are not summoned yet;
8459,ACT IV.,The galley's sails are not unfurled:--who knows?
8460,ACT IV.,The wind may change.
8461,ACT IV.,
8462,ACT IV.,"_Mar._              And if it do, it will not                      120"
8463,ACT IV.,"Change _their_ hearts, or your lot: the galley's oars"
8464,ACT IV.,Will quickly clear the harbour.
8465,ACT IV.,
8466,ACT IV.,"_Jac. Fos._                    O, ye Elements!"
8467,ACT IV.,Where are your storms?
8468,ACT IV.,
8469,ACT IV.,_Mar._                In human breasts. Alas!
8470,ACT IV.,Will nothing calm you?
8471,ACT IV.,
8472,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._           Never yet did mariner
8473,ACT IV.,Put up to patron saint such prayers for prosperous
8474,ACT IV.,"And pleasant breezes, as I call upon you,"
8475,ACT IV.,Ye tutelar saints of my own city! which
8476,ACT IV.,"Ye love not with more holy love than I,"
8477,ACT IV.,"To lash up from the deep the Adrian waves,"
8478,ACT IV.,"And waken Auster, sovereign of the Tempest!                        130"
8479,ACT IV.,Till the sea dash me back on my own shore
8480,ACT IV.,"A broken corse upon the barren Lido,"
8481,ACT IV.,Where I may mingle with the sands which skirt
8482,ACT IV.,"The land I love, and never shall see more!"
8483,ACT IV.,
8484,ACT IV.,_Mar._ And wish you this with _me_ beside you?
8485,ACT IV.,
8486,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._                                   No--
8487,ACT IV.,"No--not for thee, too good, too kind! May'st thou"
8488,ACT IV.,Live long to be a mother to those children
8489,ACT IV.,Thy fond fidelity for a time deprives
8490,ACT IV.,"Of such support! But for myself alone,"
8491,ACT IV.,"May all the winds of Heaven howl down the Gulf,                    140"
8492,ACT IV.,"And tear the vessel, till the mariners,"
8493,ACT IV.,"Appalled, turn their despairing eyes on me,"
8494,ACT IV.,"As the Phenicians did on Jonah, then"
8495,ACT IV.,"Cast me out from amongst them, as an offering"
8496,ACT IV.,To appease the waves. The billow which destroys me
8497,ACT IV.,"Will be more merciful than man, and bear me"
8498,ACT IV.,"Dead, but _still bear_ me to a native grave,"
8499,ACT IV.,"From fishers' hands, upon the desolate strand,"
8500,ACT IV.,"Which, of its thousand wrecks, hath ne'er received"
8501,ACT IV.,One lacerated like the heart which then                            150
8502,ACT IV.,Will be.--But wherefore breaks it not? why live I?
8503,ACT IV.,
8504,ACT IV.,"_Mar._ To man thyself, I trust, with time, to master"
8505,ACT IV.,Such useless passion. Until now thou wert
8506,ACT IV.,"A sufferer, but not a loud one: why"
8507,ACT IV.,What is this to the things thou hast borne in silence--
8508,ACT IV.,Imprisonment and actual torture?
8509,ACT IV.,
8510,ACT IV.,"_Jac. Fos._                     Double,"
8511,ACT IV.,"Triple, and tenfold torture! But you are right,"
8512,ACT IV.,"It must be borne. Father, your blessing."
8513,ACT IV.,
8514,ACT IV.,_Doge_.                             Would
8515,ACT IV.,It could avail thee! but no less thou hast it.
8516,ACT IV.,
8517,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._ Forgive----
8518,ACT IV.,
8519,ACT IV.,_Doge_.                What?
8520,ACT IV.,
8521,ACT IV.,"_Jac. Fos._                  My poor mother, for my birth,         160"
8522,ACT IV.,"And me for having lived, and you yourself"
8523,ACT IV.,"(As I forgive you), for the gift of life,"
8524,ACT IV.,Which you bestowed upon me as my sire.
8525,ACT IV.,
8526,ACT IV.,_Mar._   What hast thou done?
8527,ACT IV.,
8528,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._                  Nothing. I cannot charge
8529,ACT IV.,My memory with much save sorrow: but
8530,ACT IV.,I have been so beyond the common lot
8531,ACT IV.,"Chastened and visited, I needs must think"
8532,ACT IV.,"That I was wicked. If it be so, may"
8533,ACT IV.,What I have undergone here keep me from
8534,ACT IV.,A like hereafter!
8535,ACT IV.,
8536,ACT IV.,_Mar._           Fear not: _that's_ reserved                       170
8537,ACT IV.,For your oppressors.
8538,ACT IV.,
8539,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._         Let me hope not.
8540,ACT IV.,
8541,ACT IV.,_Mar._                               Hope not?
8542,ACT IV.,
8543,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._ I cannot wish them _all_ they have inflicted.
8544,ACT IV.,
8545,ACT IV.,_Mar._ _All!_ the consummate fiends! A thousandfold
8546,ACT IV.,May the worm which never dieth feed upon them!
8547,ACT IV.,
8548,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._ They may repent.
8549,ACT IV.,
8550,ACT IV.,"_Mar._                       And if they do, Heaven will not"
8551,ACT IV.,Accept the tardy penitence of demons.
8552,ACT IV.,
8553,ACT IV.,_Enter an Officer and Guards_.
8554,ACT IV.,
8555,ACT IV.,_Offi._ Signor! the boat is at the shore--the wind
8556,ACT IV.,Is rising--we are ready to attend you.
8557,ACT IV.,
8558,ACT IV.,"_Jac. Fos._ And I to be attended. Once more, father,"
8559,ACT IV.,Your hand!
8560,ACT IV.,
8561,ACT IV.,_Doge_.   Take it. Alas! how thine own trembles!                   180
8562,ACT IV.,
8563,ACT IV.,"_Jac. Fos._ No--you mistake; 'tis yours that shakes, my father."
8564,ACT IV.,Farewell!
8565,ACT IV.,
8566,ACT IV.,_Doge_.  Farewell! Is there aught else?
8567,ACT IV.,
8568,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._                            No--nothing.
8569,ACT IV.,[_To the Officer_.
8570,ACT IV.,"Lend me your arm, good Signor."
8571,ACT IV.,
8572,ACT IV.,_Offi._                       You turn pale--
8573,ACT IV.,Let me support you--paler--ho! some aid there!
8574,ACT IV.,Some water!
8575,ACT IV.,
8576,ACT IV.,"_Mar._      Ah, he is dying!"
8577,ACT IV.,
8578,ACT IV.,"_Jac. Fos._                  Now, I'm ready--"
8579,ACT IV.,My eyes swim strangely--where's the door?
8580,ACT IV.,
8581,ACT IV.,_Mar._                               Away!
8582,ACT IV.,"Let me support him--my best love! Oh, God!"
8583,ACT IV.,How faintly beats this heart--this pulse!
8584,ACT IV.,
8585,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._                              The light!
8586,ACT IV.,_Is_ it the light?--I am faint.
8587,ACT IV.,[_Officer presents him with water_.
8588,ACT IV.,
8589,ACT IV.,"_Offi._                       He will be better,"
8590,ACT IV.,"Perhaps, in the air."
8591,ACT IV.,
8592,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._          I doubt not. Father--wife--                   190
8593,ACT IV.,Your hands!
8594,ACT IV.,
8595,ACT IV.,"_Mar._      There's death in that damp, clammy grasp.[74]"
8596,ACT IV.,"Oh, God!--My Foscari, how fare you?"
8597,ACT IV.,
8598,ACT IV.,_Jac. Fos._                         Well!                  [_He dies_.
8599,ACT IV.,
8600,ACT IV.,_Offi._ He's gone!
8601,ACT IV.,
8602,ACT IV.,_Doge_.            He's free.
8603,ACT IV.,
8604,ACT IV.,"_Mar._                       No--no, he is not dead;"
8605,ACT IV.,There must be life yet in that heart--he could not[bs]
8606,ACT IV.,Thus leave me.
8607,ACT IV.,
8608,ACT IV.,_Doge_.        Daughter!
8609,ACT IV.,
8610,ACT IV.,"_Mar._                  Hold thy peace, old man!"
8611,ACT IV.,I am no daughter now--thou hast no son.
8612,ACT IV.,"Oh, Foscari!"
8613,ACT IV.,
8614,ACT IV.,_Offi._       We must remove the body.
8615,ACT IV.,
8616,ACT IV.,"_Mar._ Touch it not, dungeon miscreants! your base office"
8617,ACT IV.,"Ends with his life, and goes not beyond murder,"
8618,ACT IV.,Even by your murderous laws. Leave his remains                     200
8619,ACT IV.,To those who know to honour them.
8620,ACT IV.,
8621,ACT IV.,_Offi._                           I must
8622,ACT IV.,"Inform the Signory, and learn their pleasure."
8623,ACT IV.,
8624,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. Inform the Signory from _me_, the Doge,"
8625,ACT IV.,They have no further power upon those ashes:
8626,ACT IV.,"While he lived, he was theirs, as fits a subject--"
8627,ACT IV.,Now he is _mine_--my broken-hearted boy!              [_Exit Officer_.
8628,ACT IV.,
8629,ACT IV.,_Mar._ And I must live!
8630,ACT IV.,
8631,ACT IV.,"_Doge_.                 Your children live, Marina."
8632,ACT IV.,
8633,ACT IV.,"_Mar._ My children! true--they live, and I must live"
8634,ACT IV.,"To bring them up to serve the State, and die"
8635,ACT IV.,As died their father. Oh! what best of blessings                   210
8636,ACT IV.,Were barrenness in Venice! Would my mother
8637,ACT IV.,Had been so!
8638,ACT IV.,
8639,ACT IV.,_Doge_.      My unhappy children!
8640,ACT IV.,
8641,ACT IV.,_Mar._                           What!
8642,ACT IV.,_You_ feel it then at last--_you!_--Where is now
8643,ACT IV.,The Stoic of the State?
8644,ACT IV.,
8645,ACT IV.,_Doge_ (_throwing himself down by the body_). _Here!_
8646,ACT IV.,
8647,ACT IV.,"_Mar._                                         Aye, weep on!"
8648,ACT IV.,I thought you had no tears--you hoarded them
8649,ACT IV.,Until they are useless; but weep on! he never
8650,ACT IV.,"Shall weep more--never, never more."
8651,ACT IV.,
8652,ACT IV.,_Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.
8653,ACT IV.,
8654,ACT IV.,_Lor._                          What's here?
8655,ACT IV.,
8656,ACT IV.,_Mar._ Ah! the Devil come to insult the dead! Avaunt!
8657,ACT IV.,Incarnate Lucifer! 'tis holy ground.
8658,ACT IV.,"A martyr's ashes now lie there, which make it                      220"
8659,ACT IV.,A shrine. Get thee back to thy place of torment!
8660,ACT IV.,
8661,ACT IV.,"_Bar._ Lady, we knew not of this sad event,"
8662,ACT IV.,But passed here merely on our path from council.
8663,ACT IV.,
8664,ACT IV.,_Mar._ Pass on.
8665,ACT IV.,
8666,ACT IV.,_Lor._          We sought the Doge.
8667,ACT IV.,
8668,ACT IV.,"_Mar._ (_pointing to the Doge, who is still on the ground"
8669,ACT IV.,"by his son's body_)                 He's busy, look,"
8670,ACT IV.,About the business _you_ provided for him.
8671,ACT IV.,Are ye content?
8672,ACT IV.,
8673,ACT IV.,_Bar._         We will not interrupt
8674,ACT IV.,A parent's sorrows.
8675,ACT IV.,
8676,ACT IV.,"_Mar._             No, ye only make them,"
8677,ACT IV.,Then leave them.
8678,ACT IV.,
8679,ACT IV.,"_Doge_ (_rising_). Sirs, I am ready."
8680,ACT IV.,
8681,ACT IV.,_Bar._                              No--not now.
8682,ACT IV.,
8683,ACT IV.,_Lor._ Yet 'twas important.
8684,ACT IV.,
8685,ACT IV.,"_Doge_.                     If 'twas so, I can"
8686,ACT IV.,Only repeat--I am ready.
8687,ACT IV.,
8688,ACT IV.,_Bar._                  It shall not be                            230
8689,ACT IV.,"Just now, though Venice tottered o'er the deep"
8690,ACT IV.,Like a frail vessel. I respect your griefs.
8691,ACT IV.,
8692,ACT IV.,_Doge_. I thank you. If the tidings which you bring
8693,ACT IV.,"Are evil, you may say them; nothing further"
8694,ACT IV.,Can touch me more than him thou look'st on there;
8695,ACT IV.,"If they be good, say on; you need not _fear_"
8696,ACT IV.,That they can _comfort_ me.
8697,ACT IV.,
8698,ACT IV.,_Bar._                      I would they could!
8699,ACT IV.,
8700,ACT IV.,"_Doge_. I spoke not to _you_, but to Loredano."
8701,ACT IV.,_He_ understands me.
8702,ACT IV.,
8703,ACT IV.,_Mar._               Ah! I thought it would be so.
8704,ACT IV.,
8705,ACT IV.,_Doge_. What mean you?
8706,ACT IV.,
8707,ACT IV.,_Mar._                 Lo! there is the blood beginning            240
8708,ACT IV.,To flow through the dead lips of Foscari--
8709,ACT IV.,The body bleeds in presence of the assassin.
8710,ACT IV.,[_To_ LOREDANO.
8711,ACT IV.,"Thou cowardly murderer by law, behold"
8712,ACT IV.,How Death itself bears witness to thy deeds!
8713,ACT IV.,
8714,ACT IV.,_Doge_. My child! this is a phantasy of grief.
8715,ACT IV.,"Bear hence the body. [_To his attendants_] Signors, if it please you,"
8716,ACT IV.,Within an hour I'll hear you.
8717,ACT IV.,
8718,ACT IV.,"[_Exeunt_ DOGE, MARINA, _and attendants with the"
8719,ACT IV.,body_. _Manent_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.
8720,ACT IV.,
8721,ACT IV.,_Bar._                       He must not
8722,ACT IV.,Be troubled now.
8723,ACT IV.,
8724,ACT IV.,
8725,ACT IV.,_Lor._            He said himself that nought
8726,ACT IV.,Could give him trouble farther.
8727,ACT IV.,
8728,ACT IV.,_Bar._                         These are words;
8729,ACT IV.,"But Grief is lonely, and the breaking in                           250"
8730,ACT IV.,Upon it barbarous.
8731,ACT IV.,
8732,ACT IV.,_Lor._             Sorrow preys upon
8733,ACT IV.,"Its solitude, and nothing more diverts it"
8734,ACT IV.,"From its sad visions of the other world,"
8735,ACT IV.,Than calling it at moments back to this.
8736,ACT IV.,The busy have no time for tears.
8737,ACT IV.,
8738,ACT IV.,_Bar._                           And therefore
8739,ACT IV.,You would deprive this old man of all business?
8740,ACT IV.,
8741,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ The thing's decreed. The Giunta[75] and ""the Ten"""
8742,ACT IV.,Have made it law--who shall oppose that law?
8743,ACT IV.,
8744,ACT IV.,_Bar._ Humanity!
8745,ACT IV.,
8746,ACT IV.,_Lor._           Because his son is dead?
8747,ACT IV.,
8748,ACT IV.,_Bar._ And yet unburied.
8749,ACT IV.,
8750,ACT IV.,_Lor._                  Had we known this when                     260
8751,ACT IV.,"The act was passing, it might have suspended"
8752,ACT IV.,"Its passage, but impedes it not--once passed."
8753,ACT IV.,
8754,ACT IV.,_Bar._ I'll not consent.
8755,ACT IV.,
8756,ACT IV.,_Lor._                  You have consented to
8757,ACT IV.,All that's essential--leave the rest to me.
8758,ACT IV.,
8759,ACT IV.,_Bar._ Why press his abdication now?
8760,ACT IV.,
8761,ACT IV.,_Lor._                              The feelings
8762,ACT IV.,Of private passion may not interrupt
8763,ACT IV.,The public benefit; and what the State
8764,ACT IV.,Decides to-day must not give way before
8765,ACT IV.,To-morrow for a natural accident.
8766,ACT IV.,
8767,ACT IV.,_Bar._ You have a son.
8768,ACT IV.,
8769,ACT IV.,_Lor._                 I _have_--and _had_ a father.               270
8770,ACT IV.,
8771,ACT IV.,_Bar._ Still so inexorable?
8772,ACT IV.,
8773,ACT IV.,_Lor._                      Still.
8774,ACT IV.,
8775,ACT IV.,_Bar._                            But let him
8776,ACT IV.,Inter his son before we press upon him
8777,ACT IV.,This edict.
8778,ACT IV.,
8779,ACT IV.,_Lor._     Let him call up into life
8780,ACT IV.,"My sire and uncle--I consent. Men may,"
8781,ACT IV.,"Even agéd men, be, or appear to be,"
8782,ACT IV.,"Sires of a hundred sons, but cannot kindle"
8783,ACT IV.,An atom of their ancestors from earth.
8784,ACT IV.,The victims are not equal; he has seen
8785,ACT IV.,"His sons expire by natural deaths, and I"
8786,ACT IV.,My sires by violent and mysterious maladies.                       280
8787,ACT IV.,"I used no poison, bribed no subtle master"
8788,ACT IV.,"Of the destructive art of healing, to"
8789,ACT IV.,Shorten the path to the eternal cure.
8790,ACT IV.,"His sons--and he had four--are dead, without"
8791,ACT IV.,_My_ dabbling in vile drugs.
8792,ACT IV.,
8793,ACT IV.,_Bar._                       And art thou sure
8794,ACT IV.,He dealt in such?
8795,ACT IV.,
8796,ACT IV.,_Lor._           Most sure.
8797,ACT IV.,
8798,ACT IV.,_Bar._                     And yet he seems
8799,ACT IV.,All openness.
8800,ACT IV.,
8801,ACT IV.,_Lor._         And so he seemed not long
8802,ACT IV.,Ago to Carmagnuola.
8803,ACT IV.,
8804,ACT IV.,_Bar._              The attainted
8805,ACT IV.,And foreign traitor?
8806,ACT IV.,
8807,ACT IV.,"_Lor._               Even so: when _he_,"
8808,ACT IV.,"After the very night in which ""the Ten"" 290"
8809,ACT IV.,"(Joined with the Doge) decided his destruction,"
8810,ACT IV.,"Met the great Duke at daybreak with a jest,"
8811,ACT IV.,Demanding whether he should augur him
8812,ACT IV.,"""The good day or good night?"" his Doge-ship answered,"
8813,ACT IV.,"""That he in truth had passed a night of vigil,"
8814,ACT IV.,"In which"" (he added with a gracious smile)"
8815,ACT IV.,"""There often has been question about you.""[76]"
8816,ACT IV.,'Twas true; the question was the death resolved
8817,ACT IV.,"Of Carmagnuola, eight months ere he died;"
8818,ACT IV.,"And the old Doge, who knew him doomed, smiled on him               300"
8819,ACT IV.,"With deadly cozenage, eight long months beforehand--"
8820,ACT IV.,Eight months of such hypocrisy as is
8821,ACT IV.,Learnt but in eighty years. Brave Carmagnuola
8822,ACT IV.,Is dead; so is young Foscari and his brethren--
8823,ACT IV.,I never _smiled_ on _them_.
8824,ACT IV.,
8825,ACT IV.,_Bar._                        Was Carmagnuola
8826,ACT IV.,Your friend?
8827,ACT IV.,
8828,ACT IV.,_Lor._      He was the safeguard of the city.
8829,ACT IV.,"In early life its foe, but in his manhood,"
8830,ACT IV.,"Its saviour first, then victim."
8831,ACT IV.,
8832,ACT IV.,_Bar._                          Ah! that seems
8833,ACT IV.,The penalty of saving cities. He
8834,ACT IV.,Whom we now act against not only saved                             310
8835,ACT IV.,"Our own, but added others to her sway."
8836,ACT IV.,
8837,ACT IV.,_Lor._ The Romans (and we ape them) gave a crown
8838,ACT IV.,To him who took a city: and they gave
8839,ACT IV.,A crown to him who saved a citizen
8840,ACT IV.,"In battle: the rewards are equal. Now,"
8841,ACT IV.,If we should measure forth the cities taken
8842,ACT IV.,"By the Doge Foscari, with citizens"
8843,ACT IV.,"Destroyed by him, or _through_ him, the account"
8844,ACT IV.,"Were fearfully against him, although narrowed"
8845,ACT IV.,"To private havoc, such as between him                              320"
8846,ACT IV.,And my dead father.
8847,ACT IV.,
8848,ACT IV.,_Bar._               Are you then thus fixed?
8849,ACT IV.,
8850,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ Why, what should change me?"
8851,ACT IV.,
8852,ACT IV.,_Bar._                            That which changes me.
8853,ACT IV.,"But you, I know, are marble to retain"
8854,ACT IV.,"A feud. But when all is accomplished, when"
8855,ACT IV.,"The old man is deposed, his name degraded,"
8856,ACT IV.,"His sons all dead, his family depressed,"
8857,ACT IV.,"And you and yours triumphant, shall you sleep?"
8858,ACT IV.,
8859,ACT IV.,_Lor._ More soundly.
8860,ACT IV.,
8861,ACT IV.,"_Bar._               That's an error, and you'll find it"
8862,ACT IV.,Ere you sleep with your fathers.
8863,ACT IV.,
8864,ACT IV.,_Lor._                          They sleep not
8865,ACT IV.,"In their accelerated graves, nor will                              330"
8866,ACT IV.,Till Foscari fills his. Each night I see them
8867,ACT IV.,"Stalk frowning round my couch, and, pointing towards"
8868,ACT IV.,"The ducal palace, marshal me to vengeance."
8869,ACT IV.,
8870,ACT IV.,_Bar._ Fancy's distemperature! There is no passion
8871,ACT IV.,More spectral or fantastical than Hate;
8872,ACT IV.,"Not even its opposite, Love, so peoples air"
8873,ACT IV.,"With phantoms, as this madness of the heart."
8874,ACT IV.,
8875,ACT IV.,_Enter an Officer_.
8876,ACT IV.,
8877,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ Where go you, sirrah?"
8878,ACT IV.,
8879,ACT IV.,_Offi._                      By the ducal order
8880,ACT IV.,To forward the preparatory rites
8881,ACT IV.,For the late Foscari's interment.
8882,ACT IV.,
8883,ACT IV.,_Bar._                           Their                             340
8884,ACT IV.,Vault has been often opened of late years.
8885,ACT IV.,
8886,ACT IV.,"_Lor._ 'Twill be full soon, and may be closed for ever!"
8887,ACT IV.,
8888,ACT IV.,_Offi._ May I pass on?
8889,ACT IV.,
8890,ACT IV.,_Lor._                 You may.
8891,ACT IV.,
8892,ACT IV.,_Bar._                         How bears the Doge
8893,ACT IV.,This last calamity?
8894,ACT IV.,
8895,ACT IV.,_Offi._             With desperate firmness.
8896,ACT IV.,"In presence of another he says little,"
8897,ACT IV.,But I perceive his lips move now and then;
8898,ACT IV.,"And once or twice I heard him, from the adjoining"
8899,ACT IV.,"Apartment, mutter forth the words--""My son!"""
8900,ACT IV.,Scarce audibly. I must proceed.                       [_Exit Officer_.
8901,ACT IV.,
8902,ACT IV.,_Bar._                          This stroke
8903,ACT IV.,Will move all Venice in his favour.
8904,ACT IV.,
8905,ACT IV.,_Lor._                              Right!                         350
8906,ACT IV.,We must be speedy: let us call together
8907,ACT IV.,The delegates appointed to convey
8908,ACT IV.,The Council's resolution.
8909,ACT IV.,
8910,ACT IV.,_Bar._                    I protest
8911,ACT IV.,Against it at this moment.
8912,ACT IV.,
8913,ACT IV.,_Lor._                     As you please--
8914,ACT IV.,"I'll take their voices on it ne'ertheless,"
8915,ACT IV.,"And see whose most may sway them, yours or mine."
8916,ACT IV.,[_Exeunt_ BARBARIGO _and_ LOREDANO.

8924,ACT V.,SCENE I.--_The_ DOGE'S _Apartment_.
8925,ACT V.,
8926,ACT V.,_The_ DOGE _and Attendants_.
8927,ACT V.,
8928,ACT V.,"_Att._ My Lord, the deputation is in waiting;"
8929,ACT V.,"But add, that if another hour would better"
8930,ACT V.,"Accord with your will, they will make it theirs."
8931,ACT V.,
8932,ACT V.,_Doge_. To me all hours are like. Let them approach.
8933,ACT V.,[_Exit Attendant_.
8934,ACT V.,
8935,ACT V.,_An Officer_. Prince! I have done your bidding.
8936,ACT V.,
8937,ACT V.,_Doge_.                                          What command?
8938,ACT V.,
8939,ACT V.,_Offi._ A melancholy one--to call the attendance
8940,ACT V.,Of----
8941,ACT V.,
8942,ACT V.,_Doge_. True--true--true: I crave your pardon. I
8943,ACT V.,"Begin to fail in apprehension, and"
8944,ACT V.,Wax very old--old almost as my years.
8945,ACT V.,"Till now I fought them off, but they begin                          10"
8946,ACT V.,To overtake me.
8947,ACT V.,
8948,ACT V.,"_Enter the Deputation, consisting of six of the Signory"
8949,ACT V.,and the Chief of the Ten_.
8950,ACT V.,
8951,ACT V.,"Noble men, your pleasure!"
8952,ACT V.,
8953,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_. In the first place, the Council doth condole"
8954,ACT V.,With the Doge on his late and private grief.
8955,ACT V.,
8956,ACT V.,_Doge_. No more--no more of that.
8957,ACT V.,
8958,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.                Will not the Duke
8959,ACT V.,Accept the homage of respect?
8960,ACT V.,
8961,ACT V.,_Doge_.                       I do
8962,ACT V.,Accept it as 'tis given--proceed.
8963,ACT V.,
8964,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_.              ""The Ten,"""
8965,ACT V.,With a selected giunta from the Senate
8966,ACT V.,"Of twenty-five of the best born patricians,"
8967,ACT V.,Having deliberated on the state
8968,ACT V.,"Of the Republic, and the o'erwhelming cares                         20"
8969,ACT V.,"Which, at this moment, doubly must oppress"
8970,ACT V.,"Your years, so long devoted to your Country,"
8971,ACT V.,"Have judged it fitting, with all reverence,"
8972,ACT V.,Now to solicit from your wisdom (which
8973,ACT V.,"Upon reflection must accord in this),"
8974,ACT V.,"The resignation of the ducal ring,"
8975,ACT V.,Which you have worn so long and venerably:
8976,ACT V.,"And to prove that they are not ungrateful, nor"
8977,ACT V.,"Cold to your years and services, they add"
8978,ACT V.,An appanage of twenty hundred golden                                30
8979,ACT V.,"Ducats, to make retirement not less splendid"
8980,ACT V.,Than should become a Sovereign's retreat.
8981,ACT V.,
8982,ACT V.,_Doge_. Did I hear rightly?
8983,ACT V.,
8984,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.          Need I say again?
8985,ACT V.,
8986,ACT V.,_Doge_. No.--Have you done?
8987,ACT V.,
8988,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.         I have spoken. Twenty four[77]
8989,ACT V.,Hours are accorded you to give an answer.
8990,ACT V.,
8991,ACT V.,_Doge_. I shall not need so many seconds.
8992,ACT V.,
8993,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.                        We
8994,ACT V.,Will now retire.
8995,ACT V.,
8996,ACT V.,_Doge_.          Stay! four and twenty hours
8997,ACT V.,Will alter nothing which I have to say.
8998,ACT V.,
8999,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. Speak!
9000,ACT V.,
9001,ACT V.,_Doge_.                    When I twice before reiterated
9002,ACT V.,"My wish to abdicate, it was refused me:                             40"
9003,ACT V.,"And not alone refused, but ye exacted"
9004,ACT V.,An oath from me that I would never more
9005,ACT V.,Renew this instance. I have sworn to die
9006,ACT V.,"In full exertion of the functions, which"
9007,ACT V.,"My Country called me here to exercise,"
9008,ACT V.,According to my honour and my conscience--
9009,ACT V.,I cannot break _my_ oath.
9010,ACT V.,
9011,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.      Reduce us not
9012,ACT V.,"To the alternative of a decree,"
9013,ACT V.,Instead of your compliance.
9014,ACT V.,
9015,ACT V.,_Doge_.                    Providence
9016,ACT V.,Prolongs my days to prove and chasten me;                           50
9017,ACT V.,But ye have no right to reproach my length
9018,ACT V.,"Of days, since every hour has been the Country's."
9019,ACT V.,"I am ready to lay down my life for her,"
9020,ACT V.,As I have laid down dearer things than life:
9021,ACT V.,But for my dignity--I hold it of
9022,ACT V.,The _whole_ Republic: when the _general_ will
9023,ACT V.,"Is manifest, then you shall all be answered."
9024,ACT V.,
9025,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. We grieve for such an answer; but it cannot
9026,ACT V.,Avail you aught.
9027,ACT V.,
9028,ACT V.,"_Doge_.         I can submit to all things,"
9029,ACT V.,"But nothing will advance; no, not a moment.                         60"
9030,ACT V.,What you decree--decree.
9031,ACT V.,
9032,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_.       With this, then, must we"
9033,ACT V.,Return to those who sent us?
9034,ACT V.,
9035,ACT V.,_Doge_.                     You have heard me.
9036,ACT V.,
9037,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. With all due reverence we retire.
9038,ACT V.,"[_Exeunt the Deputation, etc._"
9039,ACT V.,
9040,ACT V.,_Enter an Attendant_.
9041,ACT V.,
9042,ACT V.,"_Att._                                                My Lord,"
9043,ACT V.,The noble dame Marina craves an audience.
9044,ACT V.,
9045,ACT V.,_Doge_. My time is hers.
9046,ACT V.,
9047,ACT V.,_Enter_ MARINA.
9048,ACT V.,
9049,ACT V.,"_Mar._                    My Lord, if I intrude--"
9050,ACT V.,Perhaps you fain would be alone?
9051,ACT V.,
9052,ACT V.,_Doge_.                          Alone!
9053,ACT V.,"Alone, come all the world around me, I"
9054,ACT V.,Am now and evermore. But we will bear it.
9055,ACT V.,
9056,ACT V.,"_Mar._ We will, and for the sake of those who are,"
9057,ACT V.,"Endeavour----Oh, my husband!"
9058,ACT V.,
9059,ACT V.,_Doge_.                      Give it way:                           70
9060,ACT V.,I cannot comfort thee.
9061,ACT V.,
9062,ACT V.,"_Mar._                  He might have lived,"
9063,ACT V.,"So formed for gentle privacy of life,"
9064,ACT V.,"So loving, so beloved; the native of"
9065,ACT V.,"Another land, and who so blest and blessing"
9066,ACT V.,As my poor Foscari? Nothing was wanting
9067,ACT V.,Unto his happiness and mine save not
9068,ACT V.,To be Venetian.
9069,ACT V.,
9070,ACT V.,_Doge_.          Or a Prince's son.
9071,ACT V.,
9072,ACT V.,_Mar._ Yes; all things which conduce to other men's
9073,ACT V.,"Imperfect happiness or high ambition,"
9074,ACT V.,"By some strange destiny, to him proved deadly.                      80"
9075,ACT V.,"The Country and the People whom he loved,"
9076,ACT V.,"The Prince of whom he was the elder born,"
9077,ACT V.,And----
9078,ACT V.,
9079,ACT V.,_Doge_.   Soon may be a Prince no longer.
9080,ACT V.,
9081,ACT V.,_Mar._                                    How?
9082,ACT V.,
9083,ACT V.,"_Doge_. They have taken my son from me, and now aim"
9084,ACT V.,At my too long worn diadem and ring.
9085,ACT V.,Let them resume the gewgaws!
9086,ACT V.,
9087,ACT V.,"_Mar._                       Oh, the tyrants!"
9088,ACT V.,In such an hour too!
9089,ACT V.,
9090,ACT V.,_Doge_.              'Tis the fittest time;
9091,ACT V.,An hour ago I should have felt it.
9092,ACT V.,
9093,ACT V.,_Mar._                             And
9094,ACT V.,"Will you not now resent it?--Oh, for vengeance!"
9095,ACT V.,"But he, who, had he been enough protected,                          90"
9096,ACT V.,"Might have repaid protection in this moment,"
9097,ACT V.,Cannot assist his father.
9098,ACT V.,
9099,ACT V.,_Doge_.                   Nor should do so
9100,ACT V.,"Against his Country, had he a thousand lives"
9101,ACT V.,Instead of that----
9102,ACT V.,
9103,ACT V.,_Mar._            They tortured from him. This
9104,ACT V.,May be pure patriotism. I am a woman:
9105,ACT V.,To me my husband and my children were
9106,ACT V.,Country and home. I loved _him_--how I loved him!
9107,ACT V.,I have seen him pass through such an ordeal as
9108,ACT V.,"The old martyrs would have shrunk from: he is gone,"
9109,ACT V.,"And I, who would have given my blood for him,                      100"
9110,ACT V.,Have nought to give but tears! But could I compass
9111,ACT V.,"The retribution of his wrongs!--Well, well!"
9112,ACT V.,"I have sons, who shall be men."
9113,ACT V.,
9114,ACT V.,_Doge_.                       Your grief distracts you.
9115,ACT V.,
9116,ACT V.,"_Mar._ I thought I could have borne it, when I saw him"
9117,ACT V.,"Bowed down by such oppression; yes, I thought"
9118,ACT V.,That I would rather look upon his corse
9119,ACT V.,Than his prolonged captivity:--I am punished
9120,ACT V.,For that thought now. Would I were in his grave!
9121,ACT V.,
9122,ACT V.,_Doge_. I must look on him once more.
9123,ACT V.,
9124,ACT V.,_Mar._                                 Come with me!
9125,ACT V.,
9126,ACT V.,_Doge_. Is he----
9127,ACT V.,
9128,ACT V.,"_Mar._            Our bridal bed is now his bier,                  110"
9129,ACT V.,
9130,ACT V.,_Doge_. And he is in his shroud!
9131,ACT V.,
9132,ACT V.,"_Mar._                           Come, come, old man!"
9133,ACT V.,[_Exeunt the_ DOGE _and_ MARINA.
9134,ACT V.,
9135,ACT V.,_Enter_ BARBARIGO _and_ LOREDANO.
9136,ACT V.,
9137,ACT V.,_Bar._ (_to an Attendant_). Where is the Doge?
9138,ACT V.,
9139,ACT V.,"_Att._                                    This instant retired hence,"
9140,ACT V.,With the illustrious lady his son's widow.
9141,ACT V.,
9142,ACT V.,_Lor._ Where?
9143,ACT V.,
9144,ACT V.,_Att._        To the chamber where the body lies.
9145,ACT V.,
9146,ACT V.,"_Bar._ Let us return, then."
9147,ACT V.,
9148,ACT V.,"_Lor._                      You forget, you cannot."
9149,ACT V.,We have the implicit order of the Giunta
9150,ACT V.,"To await their coming here, and join them in"
9151,ACT V.,Their office: they'll be here soon after us.
9152,ACT V.,
9153,ACT V.,_Bar._ And will they press their answer on the Doge?
9154,ACT V.,
9155,ACT V.,_Lor._ 'Twas his own wish that all should be done promptly.        120
9156,ACT V.,"He answered quickly, and must so be answered;"
9157,ACT V.,"His dignity is looked to, his estate"
9158,ACT V.,Cared for--what would he more?
9159,ACT V.,
9160,ACT V.,_Bar._                         Die in his robes:
9161,ACT V.,He could not have lived long; but I have done
9162,ACT V.,"My best to save his honours, and opposed"
9163,ACT V.,"This proposition to the last, though vainly."
9164,ACT V.,Why would the general vote compel me hither?
9165,ACT V.,
9166,ACT V.,_Lor._ 'Twas fit that some one of such different thoughts
9167,ACT V.,"From ours should be a witness, lest false tongues"
9168,ACT V.,Should whisper that a harsh majority                               130
9169,ACT V.,Dreaded to have its acts beheld by others.
9170,ACT V.,
9171,ACT V.,"_Bar._ And not less, I must needs think, for the sake"
9172,ACT V.,Of humbling me for my vain opposition.
9173,ACT V.,"You are ingenious, Loredano, in"
9174,ACT V.,"Your modes of vengeance, nay, poetical,"
9175,ACT V.,A very Ovid in the art of _hating_;
9176,ACT V.,"'Tis thus (although a secondary object,"
9177,ACT V.,"Yet hate has microscopic eyes), to you"
9178,ACT V.,"I owe, by way of foil to the more zealous,"
9179,ACT V.,This undesired association in                                      140
9180,ACT V.,Your Giunta's duties.
9181,ACT V.,
9182,ACT V.,_Lor._                How!--_my_ Giunta!
9183,ACT V.,
9184,ACT V.,_Bar._                                 _Yours!_
9185,ACT V.,"They speak your language, watch your nod, approve"
9186,ACT V.,"Your plans, and do your work. Are they not _yours?_"
9187,ACT V.,
9188,ACT V.,_Lor._ You talk unwarily. 'Twere best they hear not
9189,ACT V.,This from you.
9190,ACT V.,
9191,ACT V.,_Bar._          Oh! they'll hear as much one day
9192,ACT V.,From louder tongues than mine; they have gone beyond
9193,ACT V.,Even their exorbitance of power: and when
9194,ACT V.,This happens in the most contemned and abject
9195,ACT V.,"States, stung humanity will rise to check it."
9196,ACT V.,
9197,ACT V.,_Lor._ You talk but idly.
9198,ACT V.,
9199,ACT V.,_Bar._                   That remains for proof.                   150
9200,ACT V.,Here come our colleagues.
9201,ACT V.,
9202,ACT V.,_Enter the Deputation as before_.
9203,ACT V.,
9204,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.      Is the Duke aware
9205,ACT V.,We seek his presence?
9206,ACT V.,
9207,ACT V.,_Att._               He shall be informed.
9208,ACT V.,[_Exit Attendant_.
9209,ACT V.,
9210,ACT V.,_Bar._ The Duke is with his son.
9211,ACT V.,
9212,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_.                  If it be so,"
9213,ACT V.,We will remit him till the rites are over.
9214,ACT V.,Let us return. 'Tis time enough to-morrow.
9215,ACT V.,
9216,ACT V.,"_Lor._ (_aside to Bar_.) Now the rich man's hell-fire upon your tongue,"
9217,ACT V.,"Unquenched, unquenchable! I'll have it torn"
9218,ACT V.,"From its vile babbling roots, till you shall utter"
9219,ACT V.,"Nothing but sobs through blood, for this! Sage Signors,"
9220,ACT V.,I pray ye be not hasty.                        [_Aloud to the others_.
9221,ACT V.,
9222,ACT V.,_Bar._                  But be human!                              160
9223,ACT V.,
9224,ACT V.,"_Lor._ See, the Duke comes!"
9225,ACT V.,
9226,ACT V.,_Enter the_ DOGE.
9227,ACT V.,
9228,ACT V.,_Doge_.                     I have obeyed your summons.
9229,ACT V.,
9230,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. We come once more to urge our past request.
9231,ACT V.,
9232,ACT V.,_Doge_. And I to answer.
9233,ACT V.,
9234,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.       What?
9235,ACT V.,
9236,ACT V.,_Doge_.                        My only answer.
9237,ACT V.,You have heard it.
9238,ACT V.,
9239,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_. Hear _you_ then the last decree,"
9240,ACT V.,Definitive and absolute!
9241,ACT V.,
9242,ACT V.,_Doge_.                 To the point--
9243,ACT V.,"To the point! I know of old the forms of office,"
9244,ACT V.,And gentle preludes to strong acts.--Go on!
9245,ACT V.,
9246,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. You are no longer Doge; you are released
9247,ACT V.,From your imperial oath as Sovereign;
9248,ACT V.,Your ducal robes must be put off; but for                          170
9249,ACT V.,"Your services, the State allots the appanage"
9250,ACT V.,Already mentioned in our former congress.
9251,ACT V.,"Three days are left you to remove from hence,"
9252,ACT V.,Under the penalty to see confiscated
9253,ACT V.,All your own private fortune.
9254,ACT V.,
9255,ACT V.,"_Doge_.                      That last clause,"
9256,ACT V.,"I am proud to say, would not enrich the treasury."
9257,ACT V.,
9258,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_. Your answer, Duke!"
9259,ACT V.,
9260,ACT V.,"_Lor._                                 Your answer, Francis Foscari!"
9261,ACT V.,
9262,ACT V.,_Doge_. If I could have foreseen that my old age
9263,ACT V.,"Was prejudicial to the State, the Chief"
9264,ACT V.,Of the Republic never would have shown                             180
9265,ACT V.,"Himself so far ungrateful, as to place"
9266,ACT V.,His own high dignity before his Country;
9267,ACT V.,But this _life_ having been so many years
9268,ACT V.,"_Not_ useless to that Country, I would fain"
9269,ACT V.,Have consecrated my last moments to her.
9270,ACT V.,"But the decree being rendered, I obey.[bt][78]"
9271,ACT V.,
9272,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_. If you would have the three days named extended,"
9273,ACT V.,"We willingly will lengthen them to eight,"
9274,ACT V.,As sign of our esteem.
9275,ACT V.,
9276,ACT V.,"_Doge_.                Not eight hours, Signor,"
9277,ACT V.,"Not even eight minutes--there's the ducal ring,                    190"
9278,ACT V.,[_Taking off his ring and cap_.
9279,ACT V.,And there the ducal diadem! And so
9280,ACT V.,The Adriatic's free to wed another.
9281,ACT V.,
9282,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. Yet go not forth so quickly.
9283,ACT V.,
9284,ACT V.,"_Doge_.                                        I am old, sir,"
9285,ACT V.,And even to move but slowly must begin
9286,ACT V.,To move betimes. Methinks I see amongst you
9287,ACT V.,"A face I know not.--Senator! your name,"
9288,ACT V.,"You, by your garb, Chief of the Forty!"
9289,ACT V.,
9290,ACT V.,"_Mem._                                Signor,"
9291,ACT V.,I am the son of Marco Memmo.
9292,ACT V.,
9293,ACT V.,_Doge_.                      Ah!
9294,ACT V.,Your father was my friend.--But _sons_ and _fathers!_--
9295,ACT V.,"What, ho! my servants there!"
9296,ACT V.,
9297,ACT V.,_Atten._                     My Prince!
9298,ACT V.,
9299,ACT V.,_Doge_.                                No Prince--                 200
9300,ACT V.,There are the princes of the Prince!
9301,ACT V.,[_Pointing to the Ten's Deputation_
9302,ACT V.,--Prepare
9303,ACT V.,To part from hence upon the instant.
9304,ACT V.,
9305,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_.                  Why
9306,ACT V.,So rashly? 'twill give scandal.
9307,ACT V.,
9308,ACT V.,_Doge_ (_to the Ten_).         Answer that;
9309,ACT V.,It is your province.
9310,ACT V.,[_To the Servants_.
9311,ACT V.,"--Sirs, bestir yourselves:"
9312,ACT V.,There is one burthen which I beg you bear
9313,ACT V.,"With care, although 'tis past all farther harm--"
9314,ACT V.,But I will look to that myself.
9315,ACT V.,
9316,ACT V.,_Bar._                         He means
9317,ACT V.,The body of his son.
9318,ACT V.,
9319,ACT V.,"_Doge_.              And call Marina,"
9320,ACT V.,My daughter!
9321,ACT V.,
9322,ACT V.,_Enter_ MARINA.
9323,ACT V.,
9324,ACT V.,"_Doge_.      Get thee ready, we must mourn"
9325,ACT V.,Elsewhere.
9326,ACT V.,
9327,ACT V.,_Mar._     And everywhere.
9328,ACT V.,
9329,ACT V.,"_Doge_.                  True; but in freedom,                     210"
9330,ACT V.,Without these jealous spies upon the great.
9331,ACT V.,"Signers, you may depart: what would you more?"
9332,ACT V.,We are going; do you fear that we shall bear
9333,ACT V.,"The palace with us? Its _old_ walls, ten times"
9334,ACT V.,"As _old_ as I am, and I'm very old,"
9335,ACT V.,"Have served you, so have I, and I and they"
9336,ACT V.,Could tell a tale; but I invoke them not
9337,ACT V.,"To fall upon you! else they would, as erst"
9338,ACT V.,The pillars of stone Dagon's temple on
9339,ACT V.,The Israelite and his Philistine foes.                             220
9340,ACT V.,Such power I do believe there might exist
9341,ACT V.,"In such a curse as mine, provoked by such"
9342,ACT V.,"As you; but I curse not. Adieu, good Signers!"
9343,ACT V.,May the next Duke be better than the present!
9344,ACT V.,
9345,ACT V.,_Lor._ The _present_ Duke is Paschal Malipiero.
9346,ACT V.,
9347,ACT V.,_Doge_. Not till I pass the threshold of these doors.
9348,ACT V.,
9349,ACT V.,_Lor._ Saint Mark's great bell is soon about to toll
9350,ACT V.,For his inauguration.
9351,ACT V.,
9352,ACT V.,_Doge_.               Earth and Heaven!
9353,ACT V.,Ye will reverberate this peal; and I
9354,ACT V.,Live to hear this!--the first Doge who e'er heard                  230
9355,ACT V.,"Such sound for his successor: happier he,"
9356,ACT V.,"My attainted predecessor, stern Faliero--"
9357,ACT V.,This insult at the least was spared him.
9358,ACT V.,
9359,ACT V.,_Lor._                                   What!
9360,ACT V.,Do you regret a traitor?
9361,ACT V.,
9362,ACT V.,_Doge_.                   No--I merely
9363,ACT V.,Envy the dead.
9364,ACT V.,
9365,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_.   My Lord, if you indeed"
9366,ACT V.,Are bent upon this rash abandonment
9367,ACT V.,"Of the State's palace, at the least retire"
9368,ACT V.,"By the private staircase, which conducts you towards"
9369,ACT V.,The landing-place of the canal.
9370,ACT V.,
9371,ACT V.,_Doge_.                         No. I
9372,ACT V.,Will now descend the stairs by which I mounted                     240
9373,ACT V.,"To sovereignty--the Giants' Stairs, on whose"
9374,ACT V.,Broad eminence I was invested Duke.
9375,ACT V.,"My services have called me up those steps,"
9376,ACT V.,The malice of my foes will drive me down them.[79]
9377,ACT V.,_There_ five and thirty years ago was I
9378,ACT V.,"Installed, and traversed these same halls, from which"
9379,ACT V.,I never thought to be divorced except
9380,ACT V.,"A corse--a corse, it might be, fighting for them--"
9381,ACT V.,But not pushed hence by fellow-citizens.
9382,ACT V.,But come; my son and I will go together--                          250
9383,ACT V.,"He to his grave, and I to pray for mine."
9384,ACT V.,
9385,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. What! thus in public?
9386,ACT V.,
9387,ACT V.,_Doge_.                                  I was publicly
9388,ACT V.,"Elected, and so will I be deposed."
9389,ACT V.,Marina! art thou willing?
9390,ACT V.,
9391,ACT V.,_Mar._                   Here's my arm!
9392,ACT V.,
9393,ACT V.,_Doge_. And here my _staff_: thus propped will I go forth.
9394,ACT V.,
9395,ACT V.,_Chief of the Ten_. It must not be--the people will perceive it.
9396,ACT V.,
9397,ACT V.,"_Doge_. The people,--There's no people, you well know it,"
9398,ACT V.,Else you dare not deal thus by them or me.
9399,ACT V.,"There is a _populace_, perhaps, whose looks"
9400,ACT V.,"May shame you; but they dare not groan nor curse you,              260"
9401,ACT V.,Save with their hearts and eyes.
9402,ACT V.,
9403,ACT V.,"_Chief of the Ten_.               You speak in passion,"
9404,ACT V.,Else----
9405,ACT V.,
9406,ACT V.,_Doge_. You have reason. I have spoken much
9407,ACT V.,More than my wont: it is a foible which
9408,ACT V.,"Was not of mine, but more excuses you,"
9409,ACT V.,"Inasmuch as it shows, that I approach"
9410,ACT V.,A dotage which may justify this deed
9411,ACT V.,"Of yours, although the law does not, nor will."
9412,ACT V.,"Farewell, sirs!"
9413,ACT V.,

10143,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,
10144,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,Goethe's comment on reading and reviewing _Cain_ was that he should be
10145,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such ""biblical"
10146,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"subjects,"" as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (_Conversations,"

10148,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"(_Diary_, 1869, ii. 435) that Byron should have lived ""to execute his"
10149,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament."" He was better equipped for"
10150,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"such a task than might have been imagined. A Scottish schoolboy, ""from a"
10151,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"child he had known the Scriptures,"" and, as his _Hebrew Melodies_"
10152,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"testify, he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic"
10153,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"inspiration. Moreover, he was born with the religious temperament."
10154,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Questions ""of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,"" exercised his"
10155,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit.
10156,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who
10157,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"challenged or rebuked him, Hodgson, for instance, or Dallas; and he"
10158,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of
10159,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy. He was, no"
10160,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"doubt, from first to last a _heretic_, impatient, not to say"
10161,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"contemptuous, of authority, but he was by no means indifferent to"
10162,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"religion altogether. To ""argue about it and about"" was a necessity, if"
10163,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"not an agreeable relief, to his intellectual energies. It would appear"
10164,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"from the Ravenna diary (January 28, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 190,191),"
10165,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the
10166,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"""tragedy of Cain"" was actually begun. He had been recording a ""thought"""
10167,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"which had come to him, that ""at the very height of human desire and"
10168,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"pleasure, a certain sense of doubt and sorrow""--an _amari aliquid_ which"
10169,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"links the future to the past, and so blots out the present--""mingles"
10170,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"with our bliss,"" making it of none effect, and, by way of moral or"
10171,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"corollary to his soliloquy, he adds three lines of verse headed,"
10172,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"""Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of _Cain_""--"

10181,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,eternally postponed fruition. With a being capable of infinite
10182,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"satisfaction, he is doomed to realize failure in attainment. In all that"
10183,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"is best and most enjoyable, ""the rapturous moment and the placid hour,"""
10184,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"there is a foretaste of ""Death the Unknown""! The tragedy of _Manfred_"
10185,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"lies in remorse for the inevitable past; the tragedy of _Cain_, in"
10186,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present.

10188,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"The investigation of the ""sources"" of _Cain_ does not lead to any very"
10189,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"definite conclusion (see _Lord Byron's Cain und Seine Quellen_, von"
10190,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Alfred Schaffner, 1880). He was pleased to call his play ""a Mystery,"""
10191,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"and, in his Preface (_vide post_, p. 207), Byron alludes to the Old"
10192,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Mysteries as ""those very profane productions, whether in English,"
10193,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"French, Italian, or Spanish."" The first reprint of the _Chester Plays_"
10194,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818, but Byron's knowledge of"
10195,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Mystery Plays was probably derived from _Dodsley's Plays_ (ed. 1780, l.,"
10196,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"xxxiii.-xlii.), or from John Stevens's Continuation of Dugdale's"
10197,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"_Monasticon_ (_vide post_, p. 207), or possibly, as Herr Schaffner"
10198,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"suggests, from Warton's _History of English Poetry_, ed. 1871, ii."
10199,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"222-230. He may, too, have witnessed some belated _Rappresentazione_ of"
10200,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"the Creation and Fall at Ravenna, or in one of the remoter towns or"
10201,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,villages of Italy. There is a superficial resemblance between the
10202,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel, and the conventional"
10203,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"rendering of the same incident in the _Ludus Coventriæ_, and in the"
10204,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,_Mistère du Viel Testament_; but it is unlikely that he had closely
10205,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"studied any one Mystery Play at first hand. On the other hand, his"
10206,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"recollections of Gessner's _Death of Abel_ which ""he had never read"
10207,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"since he was eight years old,"" were clearer than he imagined. Not only"
10208,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain's altar by a whirlwind,"
10209,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the _Deus_ of the
10210,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Mysteries, but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah, and the"
10211,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"evangelical piety of Adam and Abel, there is a reflection, if not an"
10212,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"imitation, of the German idyll (see Gessner's _Death of Abel_, ed. 1797,"
10213,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"pp. 80, 102)."
10214,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,
10215,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Of his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment, but he"
10216,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton's shield when he was
10217,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity. ""If _Cain_ be"
10218,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"blasphemous, _Paradise Lost_ is blasphemous"" (letter to Murray, Pisa,"
10219,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"February 8, 1822), was, he would fain believe, a conclusive answer to"
10220,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"his accusers. But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences, there is"
10221,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"a genuine affinity between Byron's Lucifer and Milton's Satan. Lucifer,"
10222,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"like Satan, is ""not less than Archangel ruined,"" a repulsed but"
10223,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"""unvanquished Titan,"" marred by a demonic sorrow, a confessor though a"
10224,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"rival of Omnipotence. He is a majestic and, as a rule, a serious and"
10225,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"solemn spirit, who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of"
10226,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"the reader. There is, however, another strain in his ghostly attributes,"
10227,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,which betrays a more recent consanguinity: now and again he gives token
10228,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles. He is sometimes, though"
10229,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"rarely, a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit, and occasionally"
10230,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,indulges in a grim _persiflage_ beneath the dignity if not the capacity
10231,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,of Satan. It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike
10232,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,personality of his own. The conception of the spirit of evil justifying
10233,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior
10234,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"morality, may, perhaps, be traced to a Manichean source, but it has been"
10235,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,touched with a new emotion. Milton's devil is an abstraction of infernal
10236,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,pride--
10237,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,
10238,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"""Sole Positive of Night!"
10239,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,Antipathist of Light!
10240,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,Fate's only essence! primal scorpion rod--
10241,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"The one permitted opposite of God!"""
10242,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,
10243,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Goethe's devil is an abstraction of scorn. He ""maketh a mock"" alike of"
10244,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"good and evil! But Byron's devil is a spirit, yet a mortal too--the"
10245,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"traducer, because he has suffered for his sins; the deceiver, because he"
10246,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,is self-deceived; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the
10247,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice. Byron did
10248,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"not uphold Lucifer, but he ""had passed that way,"" and could imagine a"
10249,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,spiritual warfare not only against the _Deus_ of the Mysteries or of the
10250,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Book of Genesis, but against what he believed and acknowledged to be"
10251,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,the Author and Principle of good.
10252,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,
10253,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"_Autres temps, autres m[oe]urs!_ It is all but impossible for the modern"
10254,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"reader to appreciate the audacity of _Cain_, or to realize the alarm and"
10255,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,indignation which it aroused by its appearance. Byron knew that he was
10256,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"raising a tempest, and pleads, in his Preface, ""that with regard to the"
10257,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"language of Lucifer, it was difficult for me to make him talk like a"
10258,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"clergyman,"" and again and again he assures his correspondents (_e.g._ to"
10259,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Murray, November 23, 1821, ""_Cain_ is nothing more than a drama;"" to"
10260,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Moore, March 4, 1822, ""With respect to Religion, can I never convince"
10261,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"you that _I_ have no such opinions as the characters in that drama,"
10262,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"which seems to have frightened everybody?"" _Letters_, 1901, v. 469; vi."
10263,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,30) that it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions
10264,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"with regard to the ""politics of paradise"" and the origin of evil. Nobody"
10265,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,seems to have believed him. It was taken for granted that Lucifer was
10266,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"the mouthpiece of Byron, that the author of _Don Juan_ was not ""on the"
10267,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"side of the angels."""
10268,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,
10269,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Little need be said of the ""literature,"" the pamphlets and poems which"
10270,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,were evoked by the publication of _Cain: A Mystery_. One of the most
10271,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"prominent assailants (said to be the Rev. H. J. Todd (1763-1845),"
10272,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Archdeacon of Cleveland, 1832, author _inter alia_ of _Original Sin_,"
10273,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"_Free Will_, etc., 1818) issued _A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray,"
10274,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"respecting a Recent Publication_, 1822, signed ""Oxoniensis."" The sting"
10275,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,of the _Remonstrance_ lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was
10276,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"indebted to Bayle's _Dictionary_ for his rabbinical legends, and that he"
10277,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the _Two
10278,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Principles, etc._, and other ""often-refuted sophisms"" with regard to the"
10279,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,origin of evil. Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman
10280,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material, but it cannot be denied"
10281,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle's ""most"
10282,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"objectionable articles"" (_e.g._ ""Adam,"" ""Eve,"" ""Abel,"" ""Manichees,"""
10283,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"""Paulicians,"" etc.). The _Remonstrance_ was answered in _A Letter to Sir"
10284,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"Walter Scott, etc._, by ""Harroviensis."" Byron welcomed such a ""Defender"
10285,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"of the Faith,"" and was anxious that Murray should print the letter"
10286,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"together with the poem. But Murray belittled the ""defender,"" and was"
10287,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"upbraided in turn for his slowness of heart (letter to Murray, June 6,"

10328,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"question for a jury. A jury might decide that _Cain_ was blasphemous,"
10329,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,and void of copyright; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind
10330,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"as to the character of the book, and a doubt as to the conclusion at"
10331,INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.,"which a jury would arrive, he was compelled to refuse the injunction."

10400,PREFACE,
10401,PREFACE,
10402,PREFACE,"The following scenes are entitled ""A Mystery,"" in conformity with the"
10403,PREFACE,"ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects, which were styled"
10404,PREFACE,"""Mysteries, or Moralities.""[87] The author has by no means taken the"
10405,PREFACE,"same liberties with his subject which were common formerly, as may be"
10406,PREFACE,seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane
10407,PREFACE,"productions, whether in English, French, Italian, or Spanish. The author"
10408,PREFACE,has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters; and
10409,PREFACE,"where it is (and this is but rarely) taken from actual _Scripture_, he"
10410,PREFACE,"has made as little alteration, even of words, as the rhythm would"
10411,PREFACE,permit. The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not
10412,PREFACE,"state that Eve was tempted by a demon, but by ""the Serpent[88];"" and"
10413,PREFACE,"that only because he was ""the most subtil of all the beasts of the"
10414,PREFACE,"field."" Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put"
10415,PREFACE,"upon this, I take the words as I find them, and reply, with Bishop"
10416,PREFACE,"Watson[89] upon similar occasions, when the Fathers were quoted to him"
10417,PREFACE,"as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge, ""Behold the Book!""--holding up"
10418,PREFACE,"the Scripture. It is to be recollected, that my present subject has"
10419,PREFACE,"nothing to do with the _New Testament_, to which no reference can be"
10420,PREFACE,here made without anachronism.[90] With the poems upon similar topics I
10421,PREFACE,have not been recently familiar. Since I was twenty I have never read
10422,PREFACE,"Milton; but I had read him so frequently before, that this may make"
10423,PREFACE,"little difference. Gesner's ""Death of Abel"" I have never read since I"
10424,PREFACE,"was eight years of age, at Aberdeen. The general impression of my"
10425,PREFACE,recollection is delight; but of the contents I remember only that Cain's
10426,PREFACE,"wife was called Mahala, and Abel's Thirza; in the following pages I have"
10427,PREFACE,"called them ""Adah"" and ""Zillah,"" the earliest female names which occur"
10428,PREFACE,in Genesis. They were those of Lamech's wives: those of Cain and Abel
10429,PREFACE,"are not called by their names. Whether, then, a coincidence of subject"
10430,PREFACE,"may have caused the same in expression, I know nothing, and care as"
10431,PREFACE,"little. [I[91] am prepared to be accused of Manicheism,[92] or some"
10432,PREFACE,"other hard name ending in _ism_, which makes a formidable figure and"
10433,PREFACE,awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled
10434,PREFACE,"to explain the terms so bandied about, as the liberal and pious"
10435,PREFACE,"indulgers in such epithets. Against such I can defend myself, or, if"
10436,PREFACE,"necessary, I can attack in turn. ""Claw for claw, as Conan said to Satan"
10437,PREFACE,"and the deevil take the shortest nails"" (Waverley).[93]]"
10438,PREFACE,
10439,PREFACE,"The reader will please to bear in mind (what few choose to recollect),"
10440,PREFACE,that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of
10441,PREFACE,"Moses, nor indeed in the Old Testament. For a reason for this"
10442,PREFACE,"extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton's ""Divine"
10443,PREFACE,"Legation;""[94] whether satisfactory or not, no better has yet been"
10444,PREFACE,"assigned. I have therefore supposed it new to Cain, without, I hope, any"
10445,PREFACE,perversion of Holy Writ.
10446,PREFACE,
10447,PREFACE,"With regard to the language of Lucifer, it was difficult for me to make"
10448,PREFACE,him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects; but I have done what I
10449,PREFACE,could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness. If he
10450,PREFACE,"disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent, it is only"
10451,PREFACE,because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to
10452,PREFACE,"anything of the kind, but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine"
10453,PREFACE,capacity.
10454,PREFACE,
10455,PREFACE,_Note_.--The reader will perceive that the author has partly adopted in
10456,PREFACE,"this poem the notion of Cuvier,[95] that the world had been destroyed"
10457,PREFACE,"several times before the creation of man. This speculation, derived from"
10458,PREFACE,the different strata and the bones of enormous and unknown animals found
10459,PREFACE,"in them, is not contrary to the Mosaic account, but rather confirms it;"
10460,PREFACE,"as no human bones have yet been discovered in those strata, although"
10461,PREFACE,those of many known animals are found near the remains of the unknown.
10462,PREFACE,"The assertion of Lucifer, that the pre-Adamite world was also peopled by"
10463,PREFACE,"rational beings much more intelligent than man, and proportionably"
10464,PREFACE,"powerful to the mammoth, etc., etc., is, of course, a poetical fiction"
10465,PREFACE,to help him to make out his case.
10466,PREFACE,
10467,PREFACE,"I ought to add, that there is a ""tramelogedia"" of Alfieri, called"
10468,PREFACE,"""Abele.""[96] I have never read that, nor any other of the posthumous"
10469,PREFACE,"works of the writer, except his Life."

10583,ACT I.,The snake spoke _truth_; it _was_ the Tree of Knowledge;

10629,ACT I.,_Cain_ (_solus_).           And this is
10630,ACT I.,Life?--Toil! and wherefore should I toil?--because
10631,ACT I.,My father could not keep his place in Eden?
10632,ACT I.,What had _I_ done in this?--I was unborn:
10633,ACT I.,I sought not to be born; nor love the state
10634,ACT I.,To which that birth has brought me. Why did he
10635,ACT I.,Yield to the Serpent and the woman? or                              70
10636,ACT I.,Yielding--why suffer? What was there in this?
10637,ACT I.,"The tree was planted, and why not for him?"
10638,ACT I.,"If not, why place him near it, where it grew"
10639,ACT I.,The fairest in the centre? They have but
10640,ACT I.,"One answer to all questions, ""'Twas _his_ will,"
10641,ACT I.,"And _he_ is good."" How know I that? Because"
10642,ACT I.,"He is all-powerful, must all-good, too, follow?"
10643,ACT I.,I judge but by the fruits--and they are bitter--
10644,ACT I.,Which I must feed on for a fault not mine.
10645,ACT I.,Whom have we here?--A shape like to the angels                      80
10646,ACT I.,Yet of a sterner and a sadder aspect
10647,ACT I.,Of spiritual essence: why do I quake?
10648,ACT I.,"Why should I fear him more than other spirits,"
10649,ACT I.,Whom I see daily wave their fiery swords
10650,ACT I.,"Before the gates round which I linger oft,"

10656,ACT I.,"If I shrink not from these, the fire-armed angels,"
10657,ACT I.,Why should I quail from him who now approaches?
10658,ACT I.,"Yet--he seems mightier far than them, nor less"

10660,ACT I.,"As he hath been, and might be: sorrow seems"

10681,ACT I.,
10682,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.            They are the thoughts of all

10685,ACT I.,
10686,ACT I.,_Cain_.                   What immortal part?
10687,ACT I.,This has not been revealed: the Tree of Life
10688,ACT I.,"Was withheld from us by my father's folly,"

10702,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Thou livest--and must live for ever. Think not
10703,ACT I.,"The Earth, which is thine outward cov'ring, is"
10704,ACT I.,Existence--it will cease--and thou wilt be--
10705,ACT I.,No less than thou art now.
10706,ACT I.,
10707,ACT I.,_Cain_.                    No _less_! and why
10708,ACT I.,No more?
10709,ACT I.,
10710,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.    It may be thou shalt be as we.                       120
10711,ACT I.,
10712,ACT I.,_Cain_. And ye?
10713,ACT I.,
10714,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.      Are everlasting.
10715,ACT I.,
10716,ACT I.,_Cain_.                         Are ye happy?
10717,ACT I.,
10718,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. We are mighty.
10719,ACT I.,
10720,ACT I.,_Cain_.                    Are ye happy?
10721,ACT I.,
10722,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                               No: art thou?
10723,ACT I.,
10724,ACT I.,_Cain_. How should I be so? Look on me!
10725,ACT I.,
10726,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                               Poor clay!
10727,ACT I.,And thou pretendest to be wretched! Thou!
10728,ACT I.,
10729,ACT I.,"_Cain_. I am:--and thou, with all thy might, what art thou?"
10730,ACT I.,
10731,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. One who aspired to be what made thee, and"
10732,ACT I.,Would not have made thee what thou art.
10733,ACT I.,
10734,ACT I.,_Cain_.                                 Ah!
10735,ACT I.,Thou look'st almost a god; and----
10736,ACT I.,
10737,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                        I am none:
10738,ACT I.,"And having failed to be one, would be nought"
10739,ACT I.,Save what I am. He conquered; let him reign!                       130
10740,ACT I.,
10741,ACT I.,_Cain_. Who?
10742,ACT I.,
10743,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.   Thy Sire's maker--and the Earth's.
10744,ACT I.,
10745,ACT I.,"_Cain_.                                        And Heaven's,"
10746,ACT I.,And all that in them is. So I have heard
10747,ACT I.,His Seraphs sing; and so my father saith.
10748,ACT I.,
10749,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. They say--what they must sing and say, on pain"
10750,ACT I.,"Of being that which I am,--and thou art--"
10751,ACT I.,Of spirits and of men.
10752,ACT I.,
10753,ACT I.,_Cain_.                And what is that?
10754,ACT I.,
10755,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Souls who dare use their immortality--
10756,ACT I.,Souls who dare look the Omnipotent tyrant in
10757,ACT I.,"His everlasting face, and tell him that"
10758,ACT I.,"His evil is not good! If he has made,                              140"
10759,ACT I.,"As he saith--which I know not, nor believe--"
10760,ACT I.,"But, if he made us--he cannot unmake:"
10761,ACT I.,"We are immortal!--nay, he'd _have_ us so,"
10762,ACT I.,That he may torture:--let him! He is great--
10763,ACT I.,"But, in his greatness, is no happier than"
10764,ACT I.,We in our conflict! Goodness would not make
10765,ACT I.,Evil; and what else hath he made? But let him
10766,ACT I.,Sit on his vast and solitary throne--
10767,ACT I.,"Creating worlds, to make eternity"
10768,ACT I.,Less burthensome to his immense existence                          150
10769,ACT I.,And unparticipated solitude;[99]
10770,ACT I.,Let him crowd orb on orb: he is alone
10771,ACT I.,"Indefinite, Indissoluble Tyrant;"
10772,ACT I.,"Could he but crush himself, 'twere the best boon"
10773,ACT I.,He ever granted: but let him reign on!
10774,ACT I.,And multiply himself in misery!
10775,ACT I.,"Spirits and Men, at least we sympathise--"
10776,ACT I.,"And, suffering in concert, make our pangs"
10777,ACT I.,"Innumerable, more endurable,"
10778,ACT I.,By the unbounded sympathy of all                                   160
10779,ACT I.,"With all! But _He_! so wretched in his height,"
10780,ACT I.,"So restless in his wretchedness, must still"
10781,ACT I.,"Create, and re-create--perhaps he'll make[100]"
10782,ACT I.,One day a Son unto himself--as he
10783,ACT I.,"Gave you a father--and if he so doth,"
10784,ACT I.,Mark me! that Son will be a sacrifice!
10785,ACT I.,
10786,ACT I.,_Cain_. Thou speak'st to me of things which long have swum
10787,ACT I.,In visions through my thought: I never could
10788,ACT I.,Reconcile what I saw with what I heard.
10789,ACT I.,My father and my mother talk to me                                 170
10790,ACT I.,"Of serpents, and of fruits and trees: I see"
10791,ACT I.,The gates of what they call their Paradise
10792,ACT I.,"Guarded by fiery-sworded Cherubim,"
10793,ACT I.,Which shut them out--and me: I feel the weight
10794,ACT I.,"Of daily toil, and constant thought: I look"
10795,ACT I.,"Around a world where I seem nothing, with"
10796,ACT I.,"Thoughts which arise within me, as if they"
10797,ACT I.,Could master all things--but I thought alone
10798,ACT I.,This misery was _mine_. My father is
10799,ACT I.,Tamed down; my mother has forgot the mind                          180
10800,ACT I.,Which made her thirst for knowledge at the risk
10801,ACT I.,Of an eternal curse; my brother is
10802,ACT I.,"A watching shepherd boy,[101] who offers up"
10803,ACT I.,The firstlings of the flock to him who bids
10804,ACT I.,The earth yield nothing to us without sweat;[by]
10805,ACT I.,My sister Zillah sings an earlier hymn
10806,ACT I.,Than the birds' matins; and my Adah--my
10807,ACT I.,"Own and belovéd--she, too, understands not"
10808,ACT I.,The mind which overwhelms me: never till
10809,ACT I.,Now met I aught to sympathise with me.                             190
10810,ACT I.,'Tis well--I rather would consort with spirits.
10811,ACT I.,
10812,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. And hadst thou not been fit by thine own soul
10813,ACT I.,"For such companionship, I would not now"
10814,ACT I.,Have stood before thee as I am: a serpent
10815,ACT I.,"Had been enough to charm ye, as before.[bz]"
10816,ACT I.,
10817,ACT I.,_Cain_. Ah! didst _thou_ tempt my mother?
10818,ACT I.,
10819,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.                                I tempt none,"
10820,ACT I.,"Save with the truth: was not the Tree, the Tree"
10821,ACT I.,Of Knowledge? and was not the Tree of Life
10822,ACT I.,Still fruitful? Did _I_ bid her pluck them not?
10823,ACT I.,Did I plant things prohibited within                               200
10824,ACT I.,"The reach of beings innocent, and curious"
10825,ACT I.,By their own innocence? I would have made ye
10826,ACT I.,"Gods; and even He who thrust ye forth, so thrust ye"
10827,ACT I.,"Because ""ye should not eat the fruits of life,"
10828,ACT I.,"And become gods as we."" Were those his words?"
10829,ACT I.,
10830,ACT I.,"_Cain_.   They were, as I have heard from those who heard them,"
10831,ACT I.,In thunder.
10832,ACT I.,
10833,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.    Then who was the Demon? He
10834,ACT I.,"Who would not let ye live, or he who would"
10835,ACT I.,"Have made ye live for ever, in the joy"
10836,ACT I.,And power of Knowledge?
10837,ACT I.,
10838,ACT I.,_Cain_.                Would they had snatched both                210
10839,ACT I.,"The fruits, or neither!"
10840,ACT I.,
10841,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.              One is yours already,"
10842,ACT I.,The other may be still.
10843,ACT I.,
10844,ACT I.,_Cain_.                  How so?
10845,ACT I.,
10846,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                      By being
10847,ACT I.,"Yourselves, in your resistance. Nothing can"
10848,ACT I.,"Quench the mind, if the mind will be itself"
10849,ACT I.,And centre of surrounding things--'tis made
10850,ACT I.,To sway.
10851,ACT I.,
10852,ACT I.,_Cain_.   But didst thou tempt my parents?
10853,ACT I.,
10854,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                                  I?
10855,ACT I.,"Poor clay--what should I tempt them for, or how?"
10856,ACT I.,
10857,ACT I.,_Cain_. They say the Serpent was a spirit.
10858,ACT I.,
10859,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                                   Who
10860,ACT I.,Saith that? It is not written so on high:
10861,ACT I.,"The proud One will not so far falsify,                             220"
10862,ACT I.,Though man's vast fears and little vanity
10863,ACT I.,Would make him cast upon the spiritual nature
10864,ACT I.,His own low failing. The snake _was_ the snake--
10865,ACT I.,"No more;[102] and yet not less than those he tempted,"
10866,ACT I.,"In nature being earth also--_more_ in _wisdom_,"
10867,ACT I.,"Since he could overcome them, and foreknew"
10868,ACT I.,The knowledge fatal to their narrow joys.
10869,ACT I.,Think'st thou I'd take the shape of things that die?
10870,ACT I.,
10871,ACT I.,_Cain_. But the thing had a demon?
10872,ACT I.,
10873,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                         He but woke one
10874,ACT I.,In those he spake to with his forky tongue.                        230
10875,ACT I.,I tell thee that the Serpent was no more
10876,ACT I.,Than a mere serpent: ask the Cherubim
10877,ACT I.,Who guard the tempting tree. When thousand ages
10878,ACT I.,"Have rolled o'er your dead ashes, and your seed's,"
10879,ACT I.,The seed of the then world may thus array
10880,ACT I.,"Their earliest fault in fable, and attribute"
10881,ACT I.,"To me a shape I scorn, as I scorn all"
10882,ACT I.,"That bows to him, who made things but to bend"
10883,ACT I.,"Before his sullen, sole eternity;"
10884,ACT I.,"But we, who see the truth, must speak it. Thy                      240"
10885,ACT I.,"Fond parents listened to a creeping thing,"
10886,ACT I.,And fell. For what should spirits tempt them? What
10887,ACT I.,Was there to envy in the narrow bounds
10888,ACT I.,"Of Paradise, that spirits who pervade"
10889,ACT I.,"Space----but I speak to thee of what thou know'st not,"
10890,ACT I.,With all thy Tree of Knowledge.
10891,ACT I.,
10892,ACT I.,_Cain_.                         But thou canst not
10893,ACT I.,"Speak aught of Knowledge which I would not know,"
10894,ACT I.,"And do not thirst to know, and bear a mind"
10895,ACT I.,To know.
10896,ACT I.,
10897,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.   And heart to look on?
10898,ACT I.,
10899,ACT I.,_Cain_.                           Be it proved.
10900,ACT I.,
10901,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Darest thou look on Death?
10902,ACT I.,
10903,ACT I.,_Cain_.                                He has not yet              250
10904,ACT I.,Been seen.
10905,ACT I.,
10906,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. But must be undergone.
10907,ACT I.,
10908,ACT I.,_Cain_.                            My father
10909,ACT I.,"Says he is something dreadful, and my mother"
10910,ACT I.,Weeps when he's named; and Abel lifts his eyes
10911,ACT I.,"To Heaven, and Zillah casts hers to the earth,"
10912,ACT I.,"And sighs a prayer; and Adah looks on me,"
10913,ACT I.,And speaks not.
10914,ACT I.,
10915,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.     And thou?
10916,ACT I.,
10917,ACT I.,_Cain_.                 Thoughts unspeakable
10918,ACT I.,"Crowd in my breast to burning, when I hear"
10919,ACT I.,"Of this almighty Death, who is, it seems,"
10920,ACT I.,Inevitable. Could I wrestle with him?
10921,ACT I.,"I wrestled with the lion, when a boy,                              260"
10922,ACT I.,"In play, till he ran roaring from my gripe."
10923,ACT I.,
10924,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. It has no shape; but will absorb all things
10925,ACT I.,That bear the form of earth-born being.
10926,ACT I.,
10927,ACT I.,_Cain_.                                 Ah!
10928,ACT I.,I thought it was a being: who could do
10929,ACT I.,Such evil things to beings save a being?
10930,ACT I.,
10931,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Ask the Destroyer.
10932,ACT I.,
10933,ACT I.,_Cain_.                       Who?
10934,ACT I.,
10935,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                        The Maker--Call him
10936,ACT I.,Which name thou wilt: he makes but to destroy.
10937,ACT I.,
10938,ACT I.,"_Cain_. I knew not that, yet thought it, since I heard"
10939,ACT I.,Of Death: although I know not what it is--
10940,ACT I.,Yet it seems horrible. I have looked out                           270
10941,ACT I.,In the vast desolate night in search of him;
10942,ACT I.,And when I saw gigantic shadows in
10943,ACT I.,"The umbrage of the walls of Eden, chequered"
10944,ACT I.,"By the far-flashing of the Cherubs' swords,"
10945,ACT I.,I watched for what I thought his coming; for
10946,ACT I.,With fear rose longing in my heart to know
10947,ACT I.,What 'twas which shook us all--but nothing came.
10948,ACT I.,And then I turned my weary eyes from off
10949,ACT I.,"Our native and forbidden Paradise,"
10950,ACT I.,"Up to the lights above us, in the azure,                           280"
10951,ACT I.,"Which are so beautiful: shall they, too, die?"
10952,ACT I.,
10953,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Perhaps--but long outlive both thine and thee.
10954,ACT I.,
10955,ACT I.,_Cain_. I'm glad of that: I would not have them die--
10956,ACT I.,"They are so lovely. What is Death? I fear,"
10957,ACT I.,"I feel, it is a dreadful thing; but what,"
10958,ACT I.,"I cannot compass: 'tis denounced against us,"
10959,ACT I.,"Both them who sinned and sinned not, as an ill--"
10960,ACT I.,What ill?
10961,ACT I.,
10962,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. To be resolved into the earth.
10963,ACT I.,
10964,ACT I.,_Cain_. But shall I know it?
10965,ACT I.,
10966,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.                   As I know not death,"
10967,ACT I.,I cannot answer.[103]
10968,ACT I.,
10969,ACT I.,"_Cain_.              Were I quiet earth,                           290"
10970,ACT I.,That were no evil: would I ne'er had been
10971,ACT I.,Aught else but dust!
10972,ACT I.,
10973,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.           That is a _grovelling_ wish,"
10974,ACT I.,Less than thy father's--for he wished to know!
10975,ACT I.,
10976,ACT I.,_Cain_. But not to live--or wherefore plucked he not
10977,ACT I.,The Life-tree?
10978,ACT I.,
10979,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.    He was hindered.
10980,ACT I.,
10981,ACT I.,_Cain_.                       Deadly error!
10982,ACT I.,Not to snatch first that fruit:--but ere he plucked
10983,ACT I.,"The knowledge, he was ignorant of Death."
10984,ACT I.,"Alas! I scarcely now know what it is,"
10985,ACT I.,And yet I fear it--fear I know not what!
10986,ACT I.,
10987,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. And I, who know all things, fear nothing; see           300"
10988,ACT I.,What is true knowledge.
10989,ACT I.,
10990,ACT I.,_Cain_.                 Wilt thou teach me all?
10991,ACT I.,
10992,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. Aye, upon one condition."
10993,ACT I.,
10994,ACT I.,_Cain_.                              Name it.
10995,ACT I.,
10996,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                                    That
10997,ACT I.,Thou dost fall down and worship me--thy Lord.
10998,ACT I.,
10999,ACT I.,_Cain_. Thou art not the Lord my father worships.
11000,ACT I.,
11001,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                                         No.
11002,ACT I.,
11003,ACT I.,_Cain_. His equal?
11004,ACT I.,
11005,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.        No;--I have nought in common with him!
11006,ACT I.,Nor would: I would be aught above--beneath--
11007,ACT I.,Aught save a sharer or a servant of
11008,ACT I.,His power. I dwell apart; but I am great:--
11009,ACT I.,"Many there are who worship me, and more"
11010,ACT I.,Who shall--be thou amongst the first.
11011,ACT I.,
11012,ACT I.,_Cain_.                              I never                       310
11013,ACT I.,As yet have bowed unto my father's God.
11014,ACT I.,Although my brother Abel oft implores
11015,ACT I.,That I would join with him in sacrifice:--
11016,ACT I.,Why should I bow to thee?
11017,ACT I.,
11018,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                 Hast thou ne'er bowed
11019,ACT I.,To him?
11020,ACT I.,
11021,ACT I.,_Cain_. Have I not said it?--need I say it?
11022,ACT I.,Could not thy mighty knowledge teach thee that?
11023,ACT I.,
11024,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. He who bows not to him has bowed to me.[104]
11025,ACT I.,
11026,ACT I.,_Cain_. But I will bend to neither.
11027,ACT I.,
11028,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.                          Ne'er the less,"
11029,ACT I.,Thou art my worshipper; not worshipping
11030,ACT I.,Him makes thee mine the same.
11031,ACT I.,
11032,ACT I.,_Cain_.                       And what is that?                    320
11033,ACT I.,
11034,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Thou'lt know here--and hereafter.
11035,ACT I.,
11036,ACT I.,_Cain_.                                      Let me but
11037,ACT I.,Be taught the mystery of my being.
11038,ACT I.,
11039,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                        Follow
11040,ACT I.,Where I will lead thee.
11041,ACT I.,
11042,ACT I.,_Cain_.                 But I must retire
11043,ACT I.,To till the earth--for I had promised----
11044,ACT I.,
11045,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                                What?
11046,ACT I.,
11047,ACT I.,_Cain_. To cull some first-fruits.
11048,ACT I.,
11049,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                        Why?
11050,ACT I.,
11051,ACT I.,_Cain_.                               To offer up
11052,ACT I.,With Abel on an altar.
11053,ACT I.,
11054,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.            Said'st thou not
11055,ACT I.,Thou ne'er hadst bent to him who made thee?
11056,ACT I.,
11057,ACT I.,_Cain_.                                     Yes--
11058,ACT I.,But Abel's earnest prayer has wrought upon me;
11059,ACT I.,The offering is more his than mine--and Adah----
11060,ACT I.,
11061,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Why dost thou hesitate?
11062,ACT I.,
11063,ACT I.,"_Cain_.                           She is my sister,                330"
11064,ACT I.,"Born on the same day, of the same womb; and"
11065,ACT I.,"She wrung from me, with tears, this promise; and"
11066,ACT I.,"Rather than see her weep, I would, methinks,"
11067,ACT I.,Bear all--and worship aught.
11068,ACT I.,
11069,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                   Then follow me!
11070,ACT I.,
11071,ACT I.,_Cain_. I will.
11072,ACT I.,
11073,ACT I.,_Enter_ ADAH.
11074,ACT I.,
11075,ACT I.,"_Adah_.         My brother, I have come for thee;"
11076,ACT I.,It is our hour of rest and joy--and we
11077,ACT I.,Have less without thee. Thou hast laboured not
11078,ACT I.,This morn; but I have done thy task: the fruits
11079,ACT I.,"Are ripe, and glowing as the light which ripens:"
11080,ACT I.,Come away.
11081,ACT I.,
11082,ACT I.,_Cain_.    Seest thou not?
11083,ACT I.,
11084,ACT I.,_Adah_.                    I see an angel;                         340
11085,ACT I.,We have seen many: will he share our hour
11086,ACT I.,Of rest?--he is welcome.
11087,ACT I.,
11088,ACT I.,_Cain_.                  But he is not like
11089,ACT I.,The angels we have seen.
11090,ACT I.,
11091,ACT I.,"_Adah_.                  Are there, then, others?"
11092,ACT I.,"But he is welcome, as they were: they deigned"
11093,ACT I.,To be our guests--will he?
11094,ACT I.,
11095,ACT I.,_Cain_ (_to Lucifer_).    Wilt thou?
11096,ACT I.,
11097,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                          I ask
11098,ACT I.,Thee to be mine.
11099,ACT I.,
11100,ACT I.,_Cain_.          I must away with him.
11101,ACT I.,
11102,ACT I.,_Adah_. And leave us?
11103,ACT I.,
11104,ACT I.,_Cain_.                Aye.
11105,ACT I.,
11106,ACT I.,_Adah_.                     And _me_?
11107,ACT I.,
11108,ACT I.,_Cain_.                              Belovéd Adah!
11109,ACT I.,
11110,ACT I.,_Adah_. Let me go with thee.
11111,ACT I.,
11112,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.                   No, she must not."
11113,ACT I.,
11114,ACT I.,_Adah_.                                       Who
11115,ACT I.,Art thou that steppest between heart and heart?
11116,ACT I.,
11117,ACT I.,_Cain_. He is a God.
11118,ACT I.,
11119,ACT I.,_Adah_.              How know'st thou?
11120,ACT I.,
11121,ACT I.,_Cain_.                               He speaks like               350
11122,ACT I.,A God.
11123,ACT I.,
11124,ACT I.,"_Adah_. So did the Serpent, and it lied."
11125,ACT I.,
11126,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. Thou errest, Adah!--was not the Tree that"
11127,ACT I.,Of Knowledge?
11128,ACT I.,
11129,ACT I.,_Adah_.      Aye--to our eternal sorrow.
11130,ACT I.,
11131,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. And yet that grief is knowledge--so he lied not:
11132,ACT I.,"And if he did betray you, 'twas with Truth;"
11133,ACT I.,And Truth in its own essence cannot be
11134,ACT I.,But good.
11135,ACT I.,
11136,ACT I.,_Adah_.    But all we know of it has gathered
11137,ACT I.,"Evil on ill; expulsion from our home,"
11138,ACT I.,"And dread, and toil, and sweat, and heaviness;"
11139,ACT I.,Remorse of that which was--and hope of that                        360
11140,ACT I.,Which cometh not. Cain! walk not with this Spirit.
11141,ACT I.,"Bear with what we have borne, and love me--I"
11142,ACT I.,Love thee.
11143,ACT I.,
11144,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. More than thy mother, and thy sire?"
11145,ACT I.,
11146,ACT I.,"_Adah_. I do. Is that a sin, too?"
11147,ACT I.,
11148,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.                         No, not yet;"
11149,ACT I.,It one day will be in your children.
11150,ACT I.,
11151,ACT I.,_Adah_.                              What!
11152,ACT I.,Must not my daughter love her brother Enoch?
11153,ACT I.,
11154,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Not as thou lovest Cain.
11155,ACT I.,
11156,ACT I.,"_Adah_.                             Oh, my God!"
11157,ACT I.,Shall they not love and bring forth things that love
11158,ACT I.,Out of their love? have they not drawn their milk
11159,ACT I.,"Out of this bosom? was not he, their father,                       370"
11160,ACT I.,"Born of the same sole womb,[105] in the same hour"
11161,ACT I.,With me? did we not love each other? and
11162,ACT I.,In multiplying our being multiply
11163,ACT I.,Things which will love each other as we love
11164,ACT I.,"Them?--And as I love thee, my Cain! go not"
11165,ACT I.,Forth with this spirit; he is not of ours.
11166,ACT I.,
11167,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. The sin I speak of is not of my making,"
11168,ACT I.,And cannot be a sin in you--whate'er
11169,ACT I.,It seem in those who will replace ye in
11170,ACT I.,Mortality[106].
11171,ACT I.,
11172,ACT I.,_Adah_. What is the sin which is not                               380
11173,ACT I.,Sin in itself? Can circumstance make sin
11174,ACT I.,"Or virtue?--if it doth, we are the slaves"
11175,ACT I.,Of----
11176,ACT I.,
11177,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Higher things than ye are slaves: and higher
11178,ACT I.,"Than them or ye would be so, did they not"
11179,ACT I.,Prefer an independency of torture
11180,ACT I.,"To the smooth agonies of adulation,"
11181,ACT I.,"In hymns and harpings, and self-seeking prayers,"
11182,ACT I.,"To that which is omnipotent, because"
11183,ACT I.,"It is omnipotent, and not from love,"
11184,ACT I.,But terror and self-hope.
11185,ACT I.,
11186,ACT I.,_Adah_.                   Omnipotence                              390
11187,ACT I.,Must be all goodness.
11188,ACT I.,
11189,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.            Was it so in Eden?
11190,ACT I.,
11191,ACT I.,_Adah_. Fiend! tempt me not with beauty; thou art fairer
11192,ACT I.,"Than was the Serpent, and as false."
11193,ACT I.,
11194,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                          As true.
11195,ACT I.,"Ask Eve, your mother: bears she not the knowledge"
11196,ACT I.,Of good and evil?
11197,ACT I.,
11198,ACT I.,"_Adah_.          Oh, my mother! thou"
11199,ACT I.,Hast plucked a fruit more fatal to thine offspring
11200,ACT I.,Than to thyself; thou at the least hast passed
11201,ACT I.,"Thy youth in Paradise, in innocent"
11202,ACT I.,And happy intercourse with happy spirits:
11203,ACT I.,"But we, thy children, ignorant of Eden,                            400"
11204,ACT I.,"Are girt about by demons, who assume"
11205,ACT I.,"The words of God, and tempt us with our own"
11206,ACT I.,Dissatisfied and curious thoughts--as thou
11207,ACT I.,"Wert worked on by the snake, in thy most flushed"
11208,ACT I.,"And heedless, harmless wantonness of bliss."
11209,ACT I.,I cannot answer this immortal thing
11210,ACT I.,Which stands before me; I cannot abhor him;
11211,ACT I.,"I look upon him with a pleasing fear,"
11212,ACT I.,And yet I fly not from him: in his eye
11213,ACT I.,There is a fastening attraction which                              410
11214,ACT I.,Fixes my fluttering eyes on his; my heart
11215,ACT I.,"Beats quick; he awes me, and yet draws me near,"
11216,ACT I.,Nearer and nearer:--Cain--Cain--save me from him!
11217,ACT I.,
11218,ACT I.,_Cain_. What dreads my Adah? This is no ill spirit.
11219,ACT I.,
11220,ACT I.,_Adah_. He is not God--nor God's: I have beheld
11221,ACT I.,The Cherubs and the Seraphs; he looks not
11222,ACT I.,Like them.
11223,ACT I.,
11224,ACT I.,_Cain_.   But there are spirits loftier still--
11225,ACT I.,The archangels.
11226,ACT I.,
11227,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.     And still loftier than the archangels.
11228,ACT I.,
11229,ACT I.,_Adah_. Aye--but not blesséd.
11230,ACT I.,
11231,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                    If the blessedness
11232,ACT I.,Consists in slavery--no.
11233,ACT I.,
11234,ACT I.,"_Adah_.                 I have heard it said,                      420"
11235,ACT I.,The Seraphs _love most_--Cherubim _know most_[107]--
11236,ACT I.,And this should be a Cherub--since he loves not.
11237,ACT I.,
11238,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. And if the higher knowledge quenches love,"
11239,ACT I.,What must _he be_ you cannot love when known?[ca]
11240,ACT I.,"Since the all-knowing Cherubim love least,"
11241,ACT I.,The Seraphs' love can be but ignorance:
11242,ACT I.,"That they are not compatible, the doom"
11243,ACT I.,"Of thy fond parents, for their daring, proves."
11244,ACT I.,Choose betwixt Love and Knowledge--since there is
11245,ACT I.,No other choice: your sire hath chosen already:                    430
11246,ACT I.,His worship is but fear.
11247,ACT I.,
11248,ACT I.,"_Adah_.                 Oh, Cain! choose Love."
11249,ACT I.,
11250,ACT I.,"_Cain_. For thee, my Adah, I choose not--It was"
11251,ACT I.,Born with me--but I love nought else.
11252,ACT I.,
11253,ACT I.,_Adah_.                              Our parents?
11254,ACT I.,
11255,ACT I.,_Cain_. Did they love us when they snatched from the Tree
11256,ACT I.,That which hath driven us all from Paradise?
11257,ACT I.,
11258,ACT I.,"_Adah_. We were not born then--and if we had been,"
11259,ACT I.,"Should we not love them--and our children, Cain?"
11260,ACT I.,
11261,ACT I.,_Cain_. My little Enoch! and his lisping sister!
11262,ACT I.,"Could I but deem them happy, I would half"
11263,ACT I.,Forget----but it can never be forgotten                            440
11264,ACT I.,Through thrice a thousand generations! never
11265,ACT I.,Shall men love the remembrance of the man
11266,ACT I.,Who sowed the seed of evil and mankind
11267,ACT I.,In the same hour! They plucked the tree of science
11268,ACT I.,"And sin--and, not content with their own sorrow,"
11269,ACT I.,"Begot _me_--_thee_--and all the few that are,"
11270,ACT I.,And all the unnumbered and innumerable
11271,ACT I.,"Multitudes, millions, myriads, which may be,"
11272,ACT I.,To inherit agonies accumulated
11273,ACT I.,By ages!--and _I_ must be sire of such things!                     450
11274,ACT I.,"Thy beauty and thy love--my love and joy,"
11275,ACT I.,"The rapturous moment and the placid hour,"
11276,ACT I.,"All we love in our children and each other,"
11277,ACT I.,But lead them and ourselves through many years
11278,ACT I.,"Of sin and pain--or few, but still of sorrow,"
11279,ACT I.,"Interchecked with an instant of brief pleasure,"
11280,ACT I.,To Death--the unknown! Methinks the Tree of Knowledge
11281,ACT I.,"Hath not fulfilled its promise:--if they sinned,"
11282,ACT I.,At least they ought to have known all things that are
11283,ACT I.,Of knowledge--and the mystery of Death[cb].                        460
11284,ACT I.,What do they know?--that they are miserable.
11285,ACT I.,What need of snakes and fruits to teach us that?
11286,ACT I.,
11287,ACT I.,"_Adah_. I am not wretched, Cain, and if thou"
11288,ACT I.,Wert happy----
11289,ACT I.,
11290,ACT I.,"_Cain_.       Be thou happy, then, alone--"
11291,ACT I.,"I will have nought to do with happiness,"
11292,ACT I.,Which humbles me and mine.
11293,ACT I.,
11294,ACT I.,"_Adah_.                    Alone I could not,"
11295,ACT I.,Nor _would_ be happy; but with those around us
11296,ACT I.,"I think I could be so, despite of Death,"
11297,ACT I.,"Which, as I know it not, I dread not, though"
11298,ACT I.,It seems an awful shadow--if I may                                 470
11299,ACT I.,Judge from what I have heard.
11300,ACT I.,
11301,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                    And thou couldst not
11302,ACT I.,"_Alone_, thou say'st, be happy?"
11303,ACT I.,
11304,ACT I.,"_Adah_.                         Alone! Oh, my God!"
11305,ACT I.,"Who could be happy and alone, or good?"
11306,ACT I.,To me my solitude seems sin; unless
11307,ACT I.,"When I think how soon I shall see my brother,"
11308,ACT I.,"His brother, and our children, and our parents."
11309,ACT I.,
11310,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Yet thy God is alone; and is he happy?
11311,ACT I.,"Lonely, and good?"
11312,ACT I.,
11313,ACT I.,_Adah_.           He is not so; he hath
11314,ACT I.,"The angels and the mortals to make happy,"
11315,ACT I.,And thus becomes so in diffusing joy.                              480
11316,ACT I.,"What else can joy be, but the spreading joy?[cc]"
11317,ACT I.,
11318,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_. Ask of your sire, the exile fresh from Eden;"
11319,ACT I.,Or of his first-born son: ask your own heart;
11320,ACT I.,It is not tranquil.
11321,ACT I.,
11322,ACT I.,_Adah_.            Alas! no! and you--
11323,ACT I.,Are you of Heaven?
11324,ACT I.,
11325,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.         If I am not, enquire"
11326,ACT I.,The cause of this all-spreading happiness
11327,ACT I.,(Which you proclaim) of the all-great and good
11328,ACT I.,Maker of life and living things; it is
11329,ACT I.,"His secret, and he keeps it. _We_ must bear,"
11330,ACT I.,"And some of us resist--and both in vain,                           490"
11331,ACT I.,"His Seraphs say: but it is worth the trial,"
11332,ACT I.,Since better may not be without: there is
11333,ACT I.,"A wisdom in the spirit, which directs"
11334,ACT I.,"To right, as in the dim blue air the eye"
11335,ACT I.,"Of you, young mortals, lights at once upon"
11336,ACT I.,"The star which watches, welcoming the morn."
11337,ACT I.,
11338,ACT I.,_Adah_. It is a beautiful star; I love it for
11339,ACT I.,Its beauty.
11340,ACT I.,
11341,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.    And why not adore?
11342,ACT I.,
11343,ACT I.,_Adah_.                         Our father
11344,ACT I.,Adores the Invisible only.
11345,ACT I.,
11346,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                But the symbols
11347,ACT I.,Of the Invisible are the loveliest                                 500
11348,ACT I.,Of what is visible; and yon bright star
11349,ACT I.,Is leader of the host of Heaven.
11350,ACT I.,
11351,ACT I.,_Adah_.                         Our father
11352,ACT I.,Saith that he has beheld the God himself
11353,ACT I.,Who made him and our mother.
11354,ACT I.,
11355,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                  Hast _thou_ seen him?
11356,ACT I.,
11357,ACT I.,_Adah_. Yes--in his works.
11358,ACT I.,
11359,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                 But in his being?
11360,ACT I.,
11361,ACT I.,_Adah_.                                     No--
11362,ACT I.,"Save in my father, who is God's own image;"
11363,ACT I.,"Or in his angels, who are like to thee--"
11364,ACT I.,"And brighter, yet less beautiful and powerful"
11365,ACT I.,"In seeming: as the silent sunny noon,"
11366,ACT I.,"All light, they look upon us; but thou seem'st                     510"
11367,ACT I.,"Like an ethereal night[108], where long white clouds"
11368,ACT I.,"Streak the deep purple, and unnumbered stars"
11369,ACT I.,Spangle the wonderful mysterious vault
11370,ACT I.,With things that look as if they would be suns;
11371,ACT I.,"So beautiful, unnumbered, and endearing,"
11372,ACT I.,"Not dazzling, and yet drawing us to them,"
11373,ACT I.,"They fill my eyes with tears, and so dost thou."
11374,ACT I.,"Thou seem'st unhappy: do not make us so,"
11375,ACT I.,And I will weep for thee.
11376,ACT I.,
11377,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                Alas! those tears!
11378,ACT I.,Couldst thou but know what oceans will be shed----                 520
11379,ACT I.,
11380,ACT I.,_Adah_. By me?
11381,ACT I.,
11382,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.     By all.
11383,ACT I.,
11384,ACT I.,_Adah_.               What all?
11385,ACT I.,
11386,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                     The million millions--
11387,ACT I.,The myriad myriads--the all-peopled earth--
11388,ACT I.,"The unpeopled earth--and the o'er-peopled Hell,"
11389,ACT I.,Of which thy bosom is the germ.
11390,ACT I.,
11391,ACT I.,_Adah_.                        O Cain!
11392,ACT I.,This spirit curseth us.
11393,ACT I.,
11394,ACT I.,_Cain_.                Let him say on;
11395,ACT I.,Him will I follow.
11396,ACT I.,
11397,ACT I.,_Adah_.            Whither?
11398,ACT I.,
11399,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                 To a place
11400,ACT I.,_Whence_ he shall come back to thee in an hour;
11401,ACT I.,But in that hour see things of many days.
11402,ACT I.,
11403,ACT I.,_Adah_. How can that be?
11404,ACT I.,
11405,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.               Did not your Maker make
11406,ACT I.,Out of old worlds this new one in few days?                        530
11407,ACT I.,"And cannot I, who aided in this work,"
11408,ACT I.,"Show in an hour what he hath made in many,"
11409,ACT I.,Or hath destroyed in few?
11410,ACT I.,
11411,ACT I.,_Cain_.                  Lead on.
11412,ACT I.,
11413,ACT I.,"_Adah_.                          Will he,"
11414,ACT I.,"In sooth, return within an hour?"
11415,ACT I.,
11416,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                       He shall.
11417,ACT I.,"With us acts are exempt from time, and we"
11418,ACT I.,"Can crowd eternity into an hour,"
11419,ACT I.,Or stretch an hour into eternity:
11420,ACT I.,We breathe not by a mortal measurement--
11421,ACT I.,"But that's a mystery. Cain, come on with me."
11422,ACT I.,
11423,ACT I.,_Adah_. Will he return?
11424,ACT I.,
11425,ACT I.,"_Lucifer_.              Aye, woman! he alone                       540"
11426,ACT I.,Of mortals from that place (the first and last
11427,ACT I.,"Who shall return, save ONE), shall come back to thee,"
11428,ACT I.,To make that silent and expectant world
11429,ACT I.,As populous as this: at present there
11430,ACT I.,Are few inhabitants.
11431,ACT I.,
11432,ACT I.,_Adah_.             Where dwellest thou?
11433,ACT I.,
11434,ACT I.,_Lucifer_. Throughout all space. Where should I dwell? Where are
11435,ACT I.,Thy God or Gods--there am I: all things are
11436,ACT I.,Divided with me: Life and Death--and Time--
11437,ACT I.,Eternity--and heaven and earth--and that
11438,ACT I.,"Which is not heaven nor earth, but peopled with                    550"
11439,ACT I.,Those who once peopled or shall people both--
11440,ACT I.,These are my realms! so that I do divide
11441,ACT I.,"_His_, and possess a kingdom which is not"
11442,ACT I.,"_His_[109]. If I were not that which I have said,"
11443,ACT I.,Could I stand here? His angels are within
11444,ACT I.,Your vision.
11445,ACT I.,
11446,ACT I.,_Adah_.      So they were when the fair Serpent
11447,ACT I.,Spoke with our mother first.
11448,ACT I.,
11449,ACT I.,_Lucifer_.                  Cain! thou hast heard.
11450,ACT I.,"If thou dost long for knowledge, I can satiate"
11451,ACT I.,That thirst; nor ask thee to partake of fruits
11452,ACT I.,Which shall deprive thee of a single good                          560
11453,ACT I.,The Conqueror has left thee. Follow me.
11454,ACT I.,
11455,ACT I.,"_Cain_. Spirit, I have said it."
11456,ACT I.,[_Exeunt_ LUCIFER _and_ CAIN.
11457,ACT I.,
11458,ACT I.,_Adah_ (_follows exclaiming_). Cain! my brother! Cain!
11459,ACT I.,
11460,ACT I.,
11461,ACT I.,
11462,ACT I.,
11463,ACT II.,ACT II.
11464,ACT II.,
11465,ACT II.,
11466,ACT II.,SCENE I.--_The Abyss of Space_.
11467,ACT II.,
11468,ACT II.,"_Cain_. I tread on air, and sink not--yet I fear"
11469,ACT II.,To sink.
11470,ACT II.,
11471,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Have faith in me, and thou shalt be"
11472,ACT II.,"Borne on the air[110], of which I am the Prince."
11473,ACT II.,
11474,ACT II.,_Cain_. Can I do so without impiety?
11475,ACT II.,
11476,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Believe--and sink not! doubt--and perish! thus
11477,ACT II.,"Would run the edict of the other God,"
11478,ACT II.,Who names me Demon to his angels; they
11479,ACT II.,"Echo the sound to miserable things,"
11480,ACT II.,"Which, knowing nought beyond their shallow senses,"
11481,ACT II.,"Worship the _word_ which strikes their ear, and deem                10"
11482,ACT II.,Evil or good what is proclaimed to them
11483,ACT II.,In their abasement. I will have none such:
11484,ACT II.,"Worship or worship not, thou shalt behold"
11485,ACT II.,"The worlds beyond thy little world, nor be"
11486,ACT II.,"Amerced for doubts beyond thy little life,"
11487,ACT II.,With torture of _my_ dooming. There will come
11488,ACT II.,"An hour, when, tossed upon some water-drops[cd],"
11489,ACT II.,"A man shall say to a man, ""Believe in me,"
11490,ACT II.,"And walk the waters;"" and the man shall walk"
11491,ACT II.,"The billows and be safe. _I_ will not say,                          20"
11492,ACT II.,"Believe in _me_, as a conditional creed"
11493,ACT II.,To save thee; but fly with me o'er the gulf
11494,ACT II.,"Of space an equal flight, and I will show"
11495,ACT II.,"What thou dar'st not deny,--the history"
11496,ACT II.,"Of past--and present, and of future worlds."
11497,ACT II.,
11498,ACT II.,"_Cain_. Oh God! or Demon! or whate'er thou art,"
11499,ACT II.,Is yon our earth?
11500,ACT II.,
11501,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.        Dost thou not recognise
11502,ACT II.,The dust which formed your father?
11503,ACT II.,
11504,ACT II.,_Cain_.                            Can it be?
11505,ACT II.,"Yon small blue circle, swinging in far ether[ce],"
11506,ACT II.,"With an inferior circlet purpler it still[111],                     30"
11507,ACT II.,Which looks like that which lit our earthly night?
11508,ACT II.,"Is this our Paradise? Where are its walls,"
11509,ACT II.,And they who guard them?
11510,ACT II.,
11511,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.               Point me out the site
11512,ACT II.,Of Paradise.
11513,ACT II.,
11514,ACT II.,_Cain_.      How should I? As we move
11515,ACT II.,"Like sunbeams onward, it grows small and smaller,"
11516,ACT II.,"And as it waxes little, and then less,"
11517,ACT II.,"Gathers a halo round it, like the light"
11518,ACT II.,"Which shone the roundest of the stars, when I"
11519,ACT II.,Beheld them from the skirts of Paradise:
11520,ACT II.,"Methinks they both, as we recede from them,                         40"
11521,ACT II.,Appear to join the innumerable stars
11522,ACT II.,"Which are around us; and, as we move on,"
11523,ACT II.,Increase their myriads.
11524,ACT II.,
11525,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.              And if there should be
11526,ACT II.,Worlds greater than thine own--inhabited
11527,ACT II.,By greater things--and they themselves far more
11528,ACT II.,"In number than the dust of thy dull earth,"
11529,ACT II.,"Though multiplied to animated atoms,"
11530,ACT II.,"All living--and all doomed to death--and wretched,"
11531,ACT II.,What wouldst thou think?
11532,ACT II.,
11533,ACT II.,_Cain_.                  I should be proud of thought
11534,ACT II.,Which knew such things.
11535,ACT II.,
11536,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.              But if that high thought were               50
11537,ACT II.,"Linked to a servile mass of matter--and,"
11538,ACT II.,"Knowing such things, aspiring to such things,"
11539,ACT II.,"And science still beyond them, were chained down"
11540,ACT II.,"To the most gross and petty paltry wants,"
11541,ACT II.,All foul and fulsome--and the very best
11542,ACT II.,"Of thine enjoyments a sweet degradation,"
11543,ACT II.,A most enervating and filthy cheat
11544,ACT II.,To lure thee on to the renewal of
11545,ACT II.,"Fresh souls and bodies[112], all foredoomed to be"
11546,ACT II.,"As frail, and few so happy----"
11547,ACT II.,
11548,ACT II.,_Cain_.                        Spirit! I                            60
11549,ACT II.,"Know nought of Death, save as a dreadful thing"
11550,ACT II.,"Of which I have heard my parents speak, as of"
11551,ACT II.,A hideous heritage I owe to them
11552,ACT II.,"No less than life--a heritage not happy,"
11553,ACT II.,"If I may judge, till now. But, Spirit! if"
11554,ACT II.,It be as thou hast said (and I within
11555,ACT II.,"Feel the prophetic torture of its truth),"
11556,ACT II.,Here let me die: for to give birth to those
11557,ACT II.,"Who can but suffer many years, and die--"
11558,ACT II.,"Methinks is merely propagating Death,                               70"
11559,ACT II.,And multiplying murder.
11560,ACT II.,
11561,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.              Thou canst not
11562,ACT II.,_All_ die--there is what must survive.
11563,ACT II.,
11564,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                The Other
11565,ACT II.,"Spake not of this unto my father, when"
11566,ACT II.,"He shut him forth from Paradise, with death"
11567,ACT II.,Written upon his forehead. But at least
11568,ACT II.,"Let what is mortal of me perish, that"
11569,ACT II.,I may be in the rest as angels are.
11570,ACT II.,
11571,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. _I_ am angelic: wouldst thou be as I am?
11572,ACT II.,
11573,ACT II.,"_Cain_. I know not what thou art: I see thy power,"
11574,ACT II.,"And see thou show'st me things beyond _my_ power,                   80"
11575,ACT II.,"Beyond all power of my born faculties,"
11576,ACT II.,Although inferior still to my desires
11577,ACT II.,And my conceptions.
11578,ACT II.,
11579,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.          What are they which dwell
11580,ACT II.,"So humbly in their pride, as to sojourn"
11581,ACT II.,With worms in clay?
11582,ACT II.,
11583,ACT II.,_Cain_.            And what art thou who dwellest
11584,ACT II.,"So haughtily in spirit, and canst range"
11585,ACT II.,Nature and immortality--and yet
11586,ACT II.,Seem'st sorrowful?
11587,ACT II.,
11588,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.         I seem that which I am;
11589,ACT II.,"And therefore do I ask of thee, if thou"
11590,ACT II.,Wouldst be immortal?
11591,ACT II.,
11592,ACT II.,"_Cain_.             Thou hast said, I must be                       90"
11593,ACT II.,Immortal in despite of me. I knew not
11594,ACT II.,"This until lately--but since it must be,"
11595,ACT II.,"Let me, or happy or unhappy, learn"
11596,ACT II.,To anticipate my immortality.
11597,ACT II.,
11598,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Thou didst before I came upon thee.
11599,ACT II.,
11600,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                        How?
11601,ACT II.,
11602,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. By suffering.
11603,ACT II.,
11604,ACT II.,_Cain_.                  And must torture be immortal?
11605,ACT II.,
11606,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. We and thy sons will try. But now, behold!"
11607,ACT II.,Is it not glorious?
11608,ACT II.,
11609,ACT II.,_Cain_.             Oh thou beautiful
11610,ACT II.,And unimaginable ether! and
11611,ACT II.,Ye multiplying masses of increased                                 100
11612,ACT II.,And still-increasing lights! what are ye? what
11613,ACT II.,Is this blue wilderness of interminable
11614,ACT II.,"Air, where ye roll along, as I have seen"
11615,ACT II.,The leaves along the limpid streams of Eden?
11616,ACT II.,Is your course measured for ye? Or do ye
11617,ACT II.,Sweep on in your unbounded revelry
11618,ACT II.,Through an aërial universe of endless
11619,ACT II.,Expansion--at which my soul aches to think--
11620,ACT II.,Intoxicated with eternity[113]?
11621,ACT II.,Oh God! Oh Gods! or whatsoe'er ye are!                             110
11622,ACT II.,How beautiful ye are! how beautiful
11623,ACT II.,"Your works, or accidents, or whatsoe'er"
11624,ACT II.,"They may be! Let me die, as atoms die,"
11625,ACT II.,"(If that they die), or know ye in your might"
11626,ACT II.,And knowledge! My thoughts are not in this hour
11627,ACT II.,"Unworthy what I see, though my dust is;"
11628,ACT II.,"Spirit! let me expire, or see them nearer."
11629,ACT II.,
11630,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Art thou not nearer? look back to thine earth!
11631,ACT II.,
11632,ACT II.,_Cain_. Where is it? I see nothing save a mass
11633,ACT II.,Of most innumerable lights.
11634,ACT II.,
11635,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                  Look there!                            120
11636,ACT II.,
11637,ACT II.,_Cain_. I cannot see it.
11638,ACT II.,
11639,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.               Yet it sparkles still.
11640,ACT II.,
11641,ACT II.,_Cain_. That!--yonder!
11642,ACT II.,
11643,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.            Yea.
11644,ACT II.,
11645,ACT II.,_Cain_.                   And wilt thou tell me so?
11646,ACT II.,"Why, I have seen the fire-flies and fire-worms"
11647,ACT II.,Sprinkle the dusky groves and the green banks
11648,ACT II.,"In the dim twilight, brighter than yon world"
11649,ACT II.,Which bears them.
11650,ACT II.,
11651,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.        Thou hast seen both worms and worlds,"
11652,ACT II.,Each bright and sparkling--what dost think of them?
11653,ACT II.,
11654,ACT II.,"_Cain_. That they are beautiful in their own sphere,"
11655,ACT II.,"And that the night, which makes both beautiful,"
11656,ACT II.,"The little shining fire-fly in its flight,                         130"
11657,ACT II.,"And the immortal star in its great course,"
11658,ACT II.,Must both be guided.
11659,ACT II.,
11660,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.           But by whom or what?
11661,ACT II.,
11662,ACT II.,_Cain_. Show me.
11663,ACT II.,
11664,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.       Dar'st thou behold?
11665,ACT II.,
11666,ACT II.,_Cain_.                            How know I what
11667,ACT II.,"I _dare_ behold? As yet, thou hast shown nought"
11668,ACT II.,I dare not gaze on further.
11669,ACT II.,
11670,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.                  On, then, with me."
11671,ACT II.,Wouldst thou behold things mortal or immortal?
11672,ACT II.,
11673,ACT II.,"_Cain_. Why, what are things?"
11674,ACT II.,
11675,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                  _Both_ partly: but what doth
11676,ACT II.,Sit next thy heart?
11677,ACT II.,
11678,ACT II.,_Cain_.            The things I see.
11679,ACT II.,
11680,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                          But what
11681,ACT II.,_Sate_ nearest it?
11682,ACT II.,
11683,ACT II.,"_Cain_.           The things I have not seen,"
11684,ACT II.,Nor ever shall--the mysteries of Death.                            140
11685,ACT II.,
11686,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. What, if I show to thee things which have died,"
11687,ACT II.,As I have shown thee much which cannot die?
11688,ACT II.,
11689,ACT II.,_Cain_. Do so.
11690,ACT II.,
11691,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.     Away, then! on our mighty wings!"
11692,ACT II.,
11693,ACT II.,_Cain_. Oh! how we cleave the blue! The stars fade from us!
11694,ACT II.,"The earth! where is my earth? Let me look on it,"
11695,ACT II.,For I was made of it.
11696,ACT II.,
11697,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.           'Tis now beyond thee,"
11698,ACT II.,"Less, in the universe, than thou in it;"
11699,ACT II.,Yet deem not that thou canst escape it; thou
11700,ACT II.,"Shalt soon return to earth, and all its dust:"
11701,ACT II.,"'Tis part of thy eternity, and mine.                               150"
11702,ACT II.,
11703,ACT II.,_Cain_. Where dost thou lead me?
11704,ACT II.,
11705,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                      To what was before thee!
11706,ACT II.,The phantasm of the world; of which thy world
11707,ACT II.,Is but the wreck.
11708,ACT II.,
11709,ACT II.,_Cain_.           What! is it not then new?
11710,ACT II.,
11711,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. No more than life is; and that was ere thou
11712,ACT II.,"Or _I_ were, or the things which seem to us"
11713,ACT II.,Greater than either: many things will have
11714,ACT II.,"No end; and some, which would pretend to have"
11715,ACT II.,"Had no beginning, have had one as mean"
11716,ACT II.,As thou; and mightier things have been extinct
11717,ACT II.,To make way for much meaner than we can                            160
11718,ACT II.,Surmise; for _moments_ only and the _space_
11719,ACT II.,Have been and must be all _unchangeable_.
11720,ACT II.,"But changes make not death, except to clay;"
11721,ACT II.,But thou art clay--and canst but comprehend
11722,ACT II.,"That which was clay, and such thou shall behold."
11723,ACT II.,
11724,ACT II.,_Cain_. Clay--Spirit--what thou wilt--I can survey.
11725,ACT II.,
11726,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Away, then!"
11727,ACT II.,
11728,ACT II.,"_Cain_.                But the lights fade from me fast,"
11729,ACT II.,"And some till now grew larger as we approached,"
11730,ACT II.,And wore the look of worlds.
11731,ACT II.,
11732,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                   And such they are.
11733,ACT II.,
11734,ACT II.,_Cain_. And Edens in them?
11735,ACT II.,
11736,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                 It may be.
11737,ACT II.,
11738,ACT II.,_Cain_.                              And men?                      170
11739,ACT II.,
11740,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Yea, or things higher."
11741,ACT II.,
11742,ACT II.,_Cain_.                           Aye! and serpents too?[cf]
11743,ACT II.,
11744,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Wouldst thou have men without them? must no reptiles
11745,ACT II.,"Breathe, save the erect ones?"
11746,ACT II.,
11747,ACT II.,_Cain_.                       How the lights recede!
11748,ACT II.,Where fly we?
11749,ACT II.,
11750,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.    To the world of phantoms, which"
11751,ACT II.,"Are beings past, and shadows still to come."
11752,ACT II.,
11753,ACT II.,"_Cain_. But it grows dark, and dark--the stars are gone!"
11754,ACT II.,
11755,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And yet thou seest.
11756,ACT II.,
11757,ACT II.,_Cain_.                       'Tis a fearful light!
11758,ACT II.,No sun--no moon--no lights innumerable--
11759,ACT II.,The very blue of the empurpled night
11760,ACT II.,Fades to a dreary twilight--yet I see                              180
11761,ACT II.,Huge dusky masses; but unlike the worlds
11762,ACT II.,"We were approaching, which, begirt with light,"
11763,ACT II.,Seemed full of life even when their atmosphere
11764,ACT II.,"Of light gave way, and showed them taking shapes"
11765,ACT II.,"Unequal, of deep valleys and vast mountains;"
11766,ACT II.,"And some emitting sparks, and some displaying"
11767,ACT II.,"Enormous liquid plains, and some begirt"
11768,ACT II.,"With luminous belts, and floating moons, which took,"
11769,ACT II.,"Like them, the features of fair earth:--instead,"
11770,ACT II.,All here seems dark and dreadful.
11771,ACT II.,
11772,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                         But distinct.                   190
11773,ACT II.,"Thou seekest to behold Death, and dead things?"
11774,ACT II.,
11775,ACT II.,_Cain_. I seek it not; but as I know there are
11776,ACT II.,"Such, and that my sire's sin makes him and me,"
11777,ACT II.,"And all that we inherit, liable"
11778,ACT II.,"To such, I would behold, at once, what I"
11779,ACT II.,Must one day see perforce.
11780,ACT II.,
11781,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                  Behold!
11782,ACT II.,
11783,ACT II.,_Cain_.                            'Tis darkness!
11784,ACT II.,
11785,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And so it shall be ever--but we will
11786,ACT II.,Unfold its gates!
11787,ACT II.,
11788,ACT II.,_Cain_.           Enormous vapours roll
11789,ACT II.,Apart--what's this?
11790,ACT II.,
11791,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.          Enter!
11792,ACT II.,
11793,ACT II.,_Cain_.                   Can I return?
11794,ACT II.,
11795,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Return! be sure: how else should Death be peopled?      200
11796,ACT II.,"Its present realm is thin to what it will be,"
11797,ACT II.,Through thee and thine.
11798,ACT II.,
11799,ACT II.,_Cain_.                 The clouds still open wide
11800,ACT II.,"And wider, and make widening circles round us!"
11801,ACT II.,
11802,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Advance!
11803,ACT II.,
11804,ACT II.,_Cain_.             And thou!
11805,ACT II.,
11806,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                   Fear not--without me thou
11807,ACT II.,Couldst not have gone beyond thy world. On! on!
11808,ACT II.,[_They disappear through the clouds_.
11809,ACT II.,
11810,ACT II.,
11811,ACT II.,SCENE II.--_Hades_.
11812,ACT II.,
11813,ACT II.,
11814,ACT II.,_Enter_ LUCIFER _and_ CAIN.
11815,ACT II.,
11816,ACT II.,_Cain_. How silent and how vast are these dim worlds!
11817,ACT II.,"For they seem more than one, and yet more peopled"
11818,ACT II.,Than the huge brilliant luminous orbs which swung
11819,ACT II.,"So thickly in the upper air, that I"
11820,ACT II.,Had deemed them rather the bright populace
11821,ACT II.,"Of some all unimaginable Heaven,"
11822,ACT II.,"Than things to be inhabited themselves,[cg]"
11823,ACT II.,But that on drawing near them I beheld
11824,ACT II.,Their swelling into palpable immensity
11825,ACT II.,"Of matter, which seemed made for life to dwell on,                  10"
11826,ACT II.,"Rather than life itself. But here, all is"
11827,ACT II.,"So shadowy, and so full of twilight, that"
11828,ACT II.,It speaks of a day past.
11829,ACT II.,
11830,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.              It is the realm
11831,ACT II.,Of Death.--Wouldst have it present?
11832,ACT II.,
11833,ACT II.,_Cain_.                             Till I know
11834,ACT II.,"That which it really is, I cannot answer."
11835,ACT II.,But if it be as I have heard my father
11836,ACT II.,"Deal out in his long homilies, 'tis a thing--"
11837,ACT II.,Oh God! I dare not think on't! Curséd be
11838,ACT II.,He who invented Life that leads to Death!
11839,ACT II.,"Or the dull mass of life, that, being life,                         20"
11840,ACT II.,"Could not retain, but needs must forfeit it--"
11841,ACT II.,Even for the innocent!
11842,ACT II.,
11843,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.             Dost thou curse thy father?
11844,ACT II.,
11845,ACT II.,_Cain_. Cursed he not me in giving me my birth?
11846,ACT II.,"Cursed he not me before my birth, in daring"
11847,ACT II.,To pluck the fruit forbidden?
11848,ACT II.,
11849,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                    Thou say'st well:
11850,ACT II.,The curse is mutual 'twixt thy sire and thee--
11851,ACT II.,But for thy sons and brother?
11852,ACT II.,
11853,ACT II.,_Cain_.                       Let them share it
11854,ACT II.,"With me, their sire and brother! What else is"
11855,ACT II.,Bequeathed to me? I leave them my inheritance!
11856,ACT II.,"Oh, ye interminable gloomy realms                                   30"
11857,ACT II.,"Of swimming shadows and enormous shapes,"
11858,ACT II.,"Some fully shown, some indistinct, and all"
11859,ACT II.,Mighty and melancholy--what are ye?
11860,ACT II.,"Live ye, or have ye lived?"
11861,ACT II.,
11862,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                 Somewhat of both.
11863,ACT II.,
11864,ACT II.,_Cain_. Then what is Death?
11865,ACT II.,
11866,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                  What? Hath not he who made ye
11867,ACT II.,Said 'tis another life?
11868,ACT II.,
11869,ACT II.,_Cain_.                 Till now he hath
11870,ACT II.,"Said nothing, save that all shall die."
11871,ACT II.,
11872,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                             Perhaps
11873,ACT II.,He one day will unfold that further secret.
11874,ACT II.,
11875,ACT II.,_Cain_. Happy the day!
11876,ACT II.,
11877,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.             Yes; happy! when unfolded,"
11878,ACT II.,"Through agonies unspeakable, and clogged                            40"
11879,ACT II.,"With agonies eternal, to innumerable"
11880,ACT II.,"Yet unborn myriads of unconscious atoms,"
11881,ACT II.,All to be animated for this only!
11882,ACT II.,
11883,ACT II.,_Cain_. What are these mighty phantoms which I see
11884,ACT II.,Floating around me?--They wear not the form
11885,ACT II.,Of the Intelligences I have seen
11886,ACT II.,Round our regretted and unentered Eden;
11887,ACT II.,Nor wear the form of man as I have viewed it
11888,ACT II.,"In Adam's and in Abel's, and in mine,"
11889,ACT II.,"Nor in my sister-bride's, nor in my children's:                     50"
11890,ACT II.,"And yet they have an aspect, which, though not"
11891,ACT II.,"Of men nor angels, looks like something, which,"
11892,ACT II.,"If not the last, rose higher than the first,"
11893,ACT II.,"Haughty, and high, and beautiful, and full"
11894,ACT II.,"Of seeming strength, but of inexplicable"
11895,ACT II.,Shape; for I never saw such. They bear not
11896,ACT II.,"The wing of Seraph, nor the face of man,"
11897,ACT II.,"Nor form of mightiest brute, nor aught that is"
11898,ACT II.,Now breathing; mighty yet and beautiful
11899,ACT II.,As the most beautiful and mighty which                              60
11900,ACT II.,"Live, and yet so unlike them, that I scarce"
11901,ACT II.,Can call them living.[114]
11902,ACT II.,
11903,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.               Yet they lived.
11904,ACT II.,
11905,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                  Where?
11906,ACT II.,
11907,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                                      Where
11908,ACT II.,Thou livest.
11909,ACT II.,
11910,ACT II.,_Cain_.      When?
11911,ACT II.,
11912,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.         On what thou callest earth
11913,ACT II.,They did inhabit.
11914,ACT II.,
11915,ACT II.,_Cain_.           Adam is the first.
11916,ACT II.,
11917,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Of thine, I grant thee--but too mean to be"
11918,ACT II.,The last of these.
11919,ACT II.,
11920,ACT II.,_Cain_.            And what are they?
11921,ACT II.,
11922,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                           That which
11923,ACT II.,Thou shalt be.
11924,ACT II.,
11925,ACT II.,_Cain_.        But what _were_ they?
11926,ACT II.,
11927,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.                          Living, high,"
11928,ACT II.,"Intelligent, good, great, and glorious things,"
11929,ACT II.,As much superior unto all thy sire
11930,ACT II.,"Adam could e'er have been in Eden, as                               70"
11931,ACT II.,"The sixty-thousandth generation shall be,"
11932,ACT II.,"In its dull damp degeneracy, to"
11933,ACT II.,"Thee and thy son;--and how weak they are, judge"
11934,ACT II.,By thy own flesh.
11935,ACT II.,
11936,ACT II.,_Cain_.           Ah me! and did _they_ perish?
11937,ACT II.,
11938,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Yes, from their earth, as thou wilt fade from thine."
11939,ACT II.,
11940,ACT II.,_Cain_. But was _mine_ theirs?
11941,ACT II.,
11942,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                      It was.
11943,ACT II.,
11944,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                But not as now.
11945,ACT II.,It is too little and too lowly to
11946,ACT II.,Sustain such creatures.
11947,ACT II.,
11948,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.              True, it was more glorious."
11949,ACT II.,
11950,ACT II.,_Cain_. And wherefore did it fall?
11951,ACT II.,
11952,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                         Ask him who fells.[115]
11953,ACT II.,
11954,ACT II.,_Cain_. But how?
11955,ACT II.,
11956,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.        By a most crushing and inexorable                 80
11957,ACT II.,"Destruction and disorder of the elements,"
11958,ACT II.,"Which struck a world to chaos, as a chaos"
11959,ACT II.,"Subsiding has struck out a world: such things,"
11960,ACT II.,"Though rare in time, are frequent in eternity.--"
11961,ACT II.,"Pass on, and gaze upon the past."
11962,ACT II.,
11963,ACT II.,_Cain_.                          'Tis awful!
11964,ACT II.,
11965,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And true. Behold these phantoms! they were once
11966,ACT II.,Material as thou art.
11967,ACT II.,
11968,ACT II.,_Cain_.               And must I be
11969,ACT II.,Like them?
11970,ACT II.,
11971,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Let He[116] who made thee answer that.
11972,ACT II.,"I show thee what thy predecessors are,"
11973,ACT II.,"And what they _were_ thou feelest, in degree                        90"
11974,ACT II.,Inferior as thy petty feelings and
11975,ACT II.,Thy pettier portion of the immortal part
11976,ACT II.,Of high intelligence and earthly strength.
11977,ACT II.,What ye in common have with what they had
11978,ACT II.,"Is Life, and what ye _shall_ have--Death: the rest"
11979,ACT II.,Of your poor attributes is such as suits
11980,ACT II.,Reptiles engendered out of the subsiding
11981,ACT II.,"Slime of a mighty universe, crushed into"
11982,ACT II.,"A scarcely-yet shaped planet, peopled with"
11983,ACT II.,Things whose enjoyment was to be in blindness--                    100
11984,ACT II.,"A Paradise of Ignorance, from which"
11985,ACT II.,Knowledge was barred as poison. But behold
11986,ACT II.,What these superior beings are or were;
11987,ACT II.,"Or, if it irk thee, turn thee back and till"
11988,ACT II.,"The earth, thy task--I'll waft thee there in safety."
11989,ACT II.,
11990,ACT II.,_Cain_. No: I'll stay here.
11991,ACT II.,
11992,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                   How long?
11993,ACT II.,
11994,ACT II.,_Cain_.                               For ever! Since
11995,ACT II.,"I must one day return here from the earth,"
11996,ACT II.,I rather would remain; I am sick of all
11997,ACT II.,That dust has shown me--let me dwell in shadows.
11998,ACT II.,
11999,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. It cannot be: thou now beholdest as                     110
12000,ACT II.,A vision that which is reality.
12001,ACT II.,"To make thyself fit for this dwelling, thou"
12002,ACT II.,Must pass through what the things thou seest have passed--
12003,ACT II.,The gates of Death.
12004,ACT II.,
12005,ACT II.,_Cain_.             By what gate have we entered
12006,ACT II.,Even now?
12007,ACT II.,
12008,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. By mine! But, plighted to return,"
12009,ACT II.,My spirit buoys thee up to breathe in regions
12010,ACT II.,Where all is breathless save thyself. Gaze on;
12011,ACT II.,But do not think to dwell here till thine hour
12012,ACT II.,Is come!
12013,ACT II.,
12014,ACT II.,"_Cain_. And these, too--can they ne'er repass"
12015,ACT II.,To earth again?
12016,ACT II.,
12017,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.      _Their_ earth is gone for ever--                   120
12018,ACT II.,"So changed by its convulsion, they would not"
12019,ACT II.,Be conscious to a single present spot
12020,ACT II.,Of its new scarcely hardened surface--'twas--
12021,ACT II.,"Oh, what a beautiful world it _was_!"
12022,ACT II.,
12023,ACT II.,_Cain_.                               And is!
12024,ACT II.,"It is not with the earth, though I must till it,"
12025,ACT II.,I feel at war--but that I may not profit
12026,ACT II.,"By what it bears of beautiful, untoiling,"
12027,ACT II.,Nor gratify my thousand swelling thoughts
12028,ACT II.,"With knowledge, nor allay my thousand fears"
12029,ACT II.,Of Death and Life.
12030,ACT II.,
12031,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.       What thy world is, thou see'st,                   130"
12032,ACT II.,But canst not comprehend the shadow of
12033,ACT II.,That which it was.
12034,ACT II.,
12035,ACT II.,"_Cain_.            And those enormous creatures,"
12036,ACT II.,Phantoms inferior in intelligence
12037,ACT II.,"(At least so seeming) to the things we have passed,"
12038,ACT II.,Resembling somewhat the wild habitants
12039,ACT II.,"Of the deep woods of earth, the hugest which"
12040,ACT II.,"Roar nightly in the forest, but ten-fold"
12041,ACT II.,In magnitude and terror; taller than
12042,ACT II.,The cherub-guarded walls of Eden--with
12043,ACT II.,Eyes flashing like the fiery swords which fence them--             140
12044,ACT II.,And tusks projecting like the trees stripped of
12045,ACT II.,Their bark and branches--what were they?
12046,ACT II.,
12047,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                               That which
12048,ACT II.,The Mammoth is in thy world;--but these lie
12049,ACT II.,By myriads underneath its surface.
12050,ACT II.,
12051,ACT II.,_Cain_.                            But
12052,ACT II.,None on it?
12053,ACT II.,
12054,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.   No: for thy frail race to war
12055,ACT II.,With them would render the curse on it useless--
12056,ACT II.,'Twould be destroyed so early.
12057,ACT II.,
12058,ACT II.,_Cain_.                        But why _war_?
12059,ACT II.,
12060,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. You have forgotten the denunciation
12061,ACT II.,"Which drove your race from Eden--war with all things,"
12062,ACT II.,"And death to all things, and disease to most things,               150"
12063,ACT II.,"And pangs, and bitterness; these were the fruits"
12064,ACT II.,Of the forbidden tree.
12065,ACT II.,
12066,ACT II.,_Cain_.                But animals--
12067,ACT II.,"Did they, too, eat of it, that they must die?"
12068,ACT II.,
12069,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Your Maker told ye, _they_ were made for you,"
12070,ACT II.,As you for him.--You would not have their doom
12071,ACT II.,Superior to your own? Had Adam not
12072,ACT II.,"Fallen, all had stood."
12073,ACT II.,
12074,ACT II.,_Cain_.                 Alas! the hopeless wretches!
12075,ACT II.,"They too must share my sire's fate, like his sons;"
12076,ACT II.,"Like them, too, without having shared the apple;"
12077,ACT II.,"Like them, too, without the so dear-bought _knowledge_!            160"
12078,ACT II.,It was a lying tree--for we _know_ nothing.
12079,ACT II.,At least it _promised knowledge_ at the _price_
12080,ACT II.,Of death--but _knowledge_ still: but what _knows_ man?
12081,ACT II.,
12082,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. It may be death leads to the _highest_ knowledge;
12083,ACT II.,"And being of all things the sole thing certain,[ch]"
12084,ACT II.,At least leads to the _surest_ science: therefore
12085,ACT II.,"The Tree was true, though deadly."
12086,ACT II.,
12087,ACT II.,_Cain_.                          These dim realms!
12088,ACT II.,"I see them, but I know them not."
12089,ACT II.,
12090,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                    Because
12091,ACT II.,"Thy hour is yet afar, and matter cannot"
12092,ACT II.,Comprehend spirit wholly--but 'tis something                       170
12093,ACT II.,To know there are such realms.
12094,ACT II.,
12095,ACT II.,_Cain_.                        We knew already
12096,ACT II.,That there was Death.
12097,ACT II.,
12098,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.            But not what was beyond it.
12099,ACT II.,
12100,ACT II.,_Cain_. Nor know I now.
12101,ACT II.,
12102,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.             Thou knowest that there is
12103,ACT II.,"A state, and many states beyond thine own--"
12104,ACT II.,And this thou knewest not this morn.
12105,ACT II.,
12106,ACT II.,_Cain_.                              But all
12107,ACT II.,Seems dim and shadowy.
12108,ACT II.,
12109,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.             Be content; it will
12110,ACT II.,Seem clearer to thine immortality.
12111,ACT II.,
12112,ACT II.,_Cain_. And yon immeasurable liquid space
12113,ACT II.,"Of glorious azure which floats on beyond us,"
12114,ACT II.,"Which looks like water, and which I should deem[ci]                180"
12115,ACT II.,The river which flows out of Paradise
12116,ACT II.,"Past my own dwelling, but that it is bankless"
12117,ACT II.,"And boundless, and of an ethereal hue--"
12118,ACT II.,What is it?
12119,ACT II.,
12120,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.   There is still some such on earth,"
12121,ACT II.,"Although inferior, and thy children shall"
12122,ACT II.,Dwell near it--'tis the phantasm of an Ocean.
12123,ACT II.,
12124,ACT II.,_Cain_. 'Tis like another world; a liquid sun--
12125,ACT II.,And those inordinate creatures sporting o'er
12126,ACT II.,Its shining surface?
12127,ACT II.,
12128,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.           Are its inhabitants,"
12129,ACT II.,The past Leviathans.
12130,ACT II.,
12131,ACT II.,_Cain_.               And yon immense                              190
12132,ACT II.,"Serpent, which rears his dripping mane and vasty"
12133,ACT II.,"Head, ten times higher than the haughtiest cedar,"
12134,ACT II.,"Forth from the abyss, looking as he could coil"
12135,ACT II.,Himself around the orbs we lately looked on--
12136,ACT II.,Is he not of the kind which basked beneath
12137,ACT II.,The Tree in Eden?
12138,ACT II.,
12139,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.         Eve, thy mother, best"
12140,ACT II.,Can tell what shape of serpent tempted her.
12141,ACT II.,
12142,ACT II.,_Cain_. This seems too terrible. No doubt the other
12143,ACT II.,Had more of beauty.
12144,ACT II.,
12145,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.           Hast thou ne'er beheld him?
12146,ACT II.,
12147,ACT II.,_Cain_. Many of the same kind (at least so called)                 200
12148,ACT II.,"But never that precisely, which persuaded"
12149,ACT II.,"The fatal fruit, nor even of the same aspect."
12150,ACT II.,
12151,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Your father saw him not?
12152,ACT II.,
12153,ACT II.,_Cain_.                             No: 'twas my mother
12154,ACT II.,Who tempted him--she tempted by the serpent.
12155,ACT II.,
12156,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Good man! whene'er thy wife, or thy sons' wives,"
12157,ACT II.,"Tempt thee or them to aught that's new or strange,"
12158,ACT II.,Be sure thou seest first who hath tempted _them_!
12159,ACT II.,
12160,ACT II.,_Cain_. Thy precept comes too late: there is no more
12161,ACT II.,For serpents to tempt woman to.
12162,ACT II.,
12163,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                      But there
12164,ACT II.,"Are some things still which woman may tempt man to,                210"
12165,ACT II.,And man tempt woman:--let thy sons look to it!
12166,ACT II.,My counsel is a kind one; for 'tis even
12167,ACT II.,"Given chiefly at my own expense; 'tis true,"
12168,ACT II.,"'Twill not be followed, so there's little lost.[117]"
12169,ACT II.,
12170,ACT II.,_Cain_. I understand not this.
12171,ACT II.,
12172,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                     The happier thou!--
12173,ACT II.,Thy world and thou are still too young! Thou thinkest
12174,ACT II.,Thyself most wicked and unhappy--is it
12175,ACT II.,Not so?
12176,ACT II.,
12177,ACT II.,"_Cain_. For crime, I know not; but for pain,"
12178,ACT II.,I have felt much.
12179,ACT II.,
12180,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.        First-born of the first man!
12181,ACT II.,"Thy present state of sin--and thou art evil,                       220"
12182,ACT II.,"Of sorrow--and thou sufferest, are both Eden"
12183,ACT II.,In all its innocence compared to what
12184,ACT II.,"_Thou_ shortly may'st be; and that state again,"
12185,ACT II.,"In its redoubled wretchedness, a Paradise"
12186,ACT II.,"To what thy sons' sons' sons, accumulating"
12187,ACT II.,In generations like to dust (which they
12188,ACT II.,"In fact but add to), shall endure and do.--"
12189,ACT II.,Now let us back to earth!
12190,ACT II.,
12191,ACT II.,_Cain_.                   And wherefore didst thou
12192,ACT II.,Lead me here only to inform me this?
12193,ACT II.,
12194,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Was not thy quest for knowledge?
12195,ACT II.,
12196,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                     Yes--as being          230
12197,ACT II.,The road to happiness!
12198,ACT II.,
12199,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.             If truth be so,"
12200,ACT II.,Thou hast it.
12201,ACT II.,
12202,ACT II.,_Cain_.       Then my father's God did well
12203,ACT II.,When he prohibited the fatal Tree.
12204,ACT II.,
12205,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. But had done better in not planting it.
12206,ACT II.,But ignorance of evil doth not save
12207,ACT II.,"From evil; it must still roll on the same,"
12208,ACT II.,A part of all things.
12209,ACT II.,
12210,ACT II.,_Cain_.               Not of all things. No--
12211,ACT II.,I'll not believe it--for I thirst for good.
12212,ACT II.,
12213,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And who and what doth not? _Who_ covets evil
12214,ACT II.,For its own bitter sake?--_None_--nothing! 'tis                    240
12215,ACT II.,"The leaven of all life, and lifelessness."
12216,ACT II.,
12217,ACT II.,"_Cain_. Within those glorious orbs which we behold,"
12218,ACT II.,"Distant, and dazzling, and innumerable,"
12219,ACT II.,"Ere we came down into this phantom realm,"
12220,ACT II.,Ill cannot come: they are too beautiful.
12221,ACT II.,
12222,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Thou hast seen them from afar.
12223,ACT II.,
12224,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                   And what of that?
12225,ACT II.,"Distance can but diminish glory--they,"
12226,ACT II.,"When nearer, must be more ineffable."
12227,ACT II.,
12228,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Approach the things of earth most beautiful,"
12229,ACT II.,And judge their beauty near.
12230,ACT II.,
12231,ACT II.,_Cain_.                      I have done this--                    250
12232,ACT II.,The loveliest thing I know is loveliest nearest.
12233,ACT II.,
12234,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Then there must be delusion.--What is that
12235,ACT II.,Which being nearest to thine eyes is still
12236,ACT II.,More beautiful than beauteous things remote?
12237,ACT II.,
12238,ACT II.,"_Cain_. My sister Adah.--All the stars of heaven,"
12239,ACT II.,"The deep blue noon of night, lit by an orb"
12240,ACT II.,"Which looks a spirit, or a spirit's world--"
12241,ACT II.,The hues of twilight--the Sun's gorgeous coming--
12242,ACT II.,"His setting indescribable, which fills"
12243,ACT II.,My eyes with pleasant tears as I behold                            260
12244,ACT II.,"Him sink, and feel my heart float softly with him"
12245,ACT II.,Along that western paradise of clouds--
12246,ACT II.,"The forest shade, the green bough, the bird's voice--"
12247,ACT II.,"The vesper bird's, which seems to sing of love,"
12248,ACT II.,"And mingles with the song of Cherubim,"
12249,ACT II.,As the day closes over Eden's walls;--
12250,ACT II.,"All these are nothing, to my eyes and heart,"
12251,ACT II.,Like Adah's face: I turn from earth and heaven
12252,ACT II.,To gaze on it.
12253,ACT II.,
12254,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.      'Tis fair as frail mortality,"
12255,ACT II.,"In the first dawn and bloom of young creation,                     270"
12256,ACT II.,"And earliest embraces of earth's parents,"
12257,ACT II.,Can make its offspring; still it is delusion.
12258,ACT II.,
12259,ACT II.,"_Cain_. You think so, being not her brother."
12260,ACT II.,
12261,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                                    Mortal!
12262,ACT II.,My brotherhood's with those who have no children.
12263,ACT II.,
12264,ACT II.,_Cain_. Then thou canst have no fellowship with us.
12265,ACT II.,
12266,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. It may be that thine own shall be for me.
12267,ACT II.,But if thou dost possess a beautiful
12268,ACT II.,"Being beyond all beauty in thine eyes,"
12269,ACT II.,Why art thou wretched?
12270,ACT II.,
12271,ACT II.,_Cain_.                Why do I exist?
12272,ACT II.,Why art _thou_ wretched? why are all things so?                    280
12273,ACT II.,"Ev'n he who made us must be, as the maker"
12274,ACT II.,Of things unhappy! To produce destruction
12275,ACT II.,"Can surely never be the task of joy,"
12276,ACT II.,And yet my sire says he's omnipotent:
12277,ACT II.,Then why is Evil--he being Good? I asked
12278,ACT II.,"This question of my father; and he said,"
12279,ACT II.,Because this Evil only was the path
12280,ACT II.,"To Good. Strange Good, that must arise from out"
12281,ACT II.,Its deadly opposite. I lately saw
12282,ACT II.,A lamb stung by a reptile: the poor suckling                       290
12283,ACT II.,"Lay foaming on the earth, beneath the vain"
12284,ACT II.,And piteous bleating of its restless dam;
12285,ACT II.,"My father plucked some herbs, and laid them to"
12286,ACT II.,The wound; and by degrees the helpless wretch
12287,ACT II.,"Resumed its careless life, and rose to drain"
12288,ACT II.,"The mother's milk, who o'er it tremulous"
12289,ACT II.,Stood licking its reviving limbs with joy.
12290,ACT II.,"Behold, my son! said Adam, how from Evil"
12291,ACT II.,Springs Good![118]
12292,ACT II.,
12293,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.     What didst thou answer?
12294,ACT II.,
12295,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                Nothing; for
12296,ACT II.,"He is my father: but I thought, that 'twere                        300"
12297,ACT II.,A better portion for the animal
12298,ACT II.,"Never to have been _stung at all_, than to"
12299,ACT II.,Purchase renewal of its little life
12300,ACT II.,"With agonies unutterable, though"
12301,ACT II.,Dispelled by antidotes.
12302,ACT II.,
12303,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.             But as thou saidst
12304,ACT II.,Of all belovéd things thou lovest her
12305,ACT II.,"Who shared thy mother's milk, and giveth hers"
12306,ACT II.,Unto thy children----
12307,ACT II.,
12308,ACT II.,_Cain_.               Most assuredly:
12309,ACT II.,What should I be without her?
12310,ACT II.,
12311,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                    What am I?
12312,ACT II.,
12313,ACT II.,_Cain_. Dost thou love nothing?
12314,ACT II.,
12315,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                      What does thy God love?            310
12316,ACT II.,
12317,ACT II.,"_Cain_. All things, my father says; but I confess"
12318,ACT II.,I see it not in their allotment here.
12319,ACT II.,
12320,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. And, therefore, thou canst not see if _I_ love"
12321,ACT II.,"Or no--except some vast and general purpose,"
12322,ACT II.,To which particular things must melt like snows.
12323,ACT II.,
12324,ACT II.,_Cain_. Snows! what are they?
12325,ACT II.,
12326,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                    Be happier in not knowing
12327,ACT II.,What thy remoter offspring must encounter;
12328,ACT II.,But bask beneath the clime which knows no winter.
12329,ACT II.,
12330,ACT II.,_Cain_. But dost thou not love something like thyself?
12331,ACT II.,
12332,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And dost thou love _thyself_?
12333,ACT II.,
12334,ACT II.,"_Cain_.                                 Yes, but love more         320"
12335,ACT II.,"What makes my feelings more endurable,"
12336,ACT II.,"And is more than myself, because I love it!"
12337,ACT II.,
12338,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. Thou lovest it, because 'tis beautiful,"
12339,ACT II.,As was the apple in thy mother's eye;
12340,ACT II.,"And when it ceases to be so, thy love"
12341,ACT II.,"Will cease, like any other appetite.[119]"
12342,ACT II.,
12343,ACT II.,_Cain_. Cease to be beautiful! how can that be?
12344,ACT II.,
12345,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. With time.
12346,ACT II.,
12347,ACT II.,"_Cain_.               But time has passed, and hitherto"
12348,ACT II.,Even Adam and my mother both are fair:
12349,ACT II.,Not fair like Adah and the Seraphim--                              330
12350,ACT II.,But very fair.
12351,ACT II.,
12352,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.     All that must pass away
12353,ACT II.,In them and her.
12354,ACT II.,
12355,ACT II.,_Cain_.          I'm sorry for it; but
12356,ACT II.,Cannot conceive my love for her the less:
12357,ACT II.,"And when her beauty disappears, methinks"
12358,ACT II.,He who creates all beauty will lose more
12359,ACT II.,Than me in seeing perish such a work.
12360,ACT II.,
12361,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. I pity thee who lovest what must perish.
12362,ACT II.,
12363,ACT II.,_Cain_. And I thee who lov'st nothing.
12364,ACT II.,
12365,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                             And thy brother--
12366,ACT II.,Sits he not near thy heart?
12367,ACT II.,
12368,ACT II.,_Cain_.                    Why should he not?
12369,ACT II.,
12370,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Thy father loves him well--so does thy God.             340
12371,ACT II.,
12372,ACT II.,_Cain_. And so do I.
12373,ACT II.,
12374,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.           'Tis well and meekly done.
12375,ACT II.,
12376,ACT II.,_Cain_. Meekly!
12377,ACT II.,
12378,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.      He is the second born of flesh,"
12379,ACT II.,And is his mother's favourite.
12380,ACT II.,
12381,ACT II.,_Cain_.                        Let him keep
12382,ACT II.,"Her favour, since the Serpent was the first"
12383,ACT II.,To win it.
12384,ACT II.,
12385,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And his father's?
12386,ACT II.,
12387,ACT II.,_Cain_.                      What is that
12388,ACT II.,To me? should I not love that which all love?
12389,ACT II.,
12390,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. And the Jehovah--the indulgent Lord,"
12391,ACT II.,And bounteous planter of barred Paradise--
12392,ACT II.,"He, too, looks smilingly on Abel."
12393,ACT II.,
12394,ACT II.,_Cain_.                           I
12395,ACT II.,"Ne'er saw him, and I know not if he smiles.                        350"
12396,ACT II.,
12397,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. But you have seen his angels.
12398,ACT II.,
12399,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                  Rarely.
12400,ACT II.,
12401,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                                       But
12402,ACT II.,Sufficiently to see they love your brother:
12403,ACT II.,_His_ sacrifices are acceptable.
12404,ACT II.,
12405,ACT II.,_Cain_. So be they! wherefore speak to me of this?
12406,ACT II.,
12407,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Because thou hast thought of this ere now.
12408,ACT II.,
12409,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                               And if
12410,ACT II.,"I _have_ thought, why recall a thought that----"
12411,ACT II.,(_he pauses as agitated_)--Spirit!
12412,ACT II.,_Here_ we are in _thy_ world; speak not of _mine_.
12413,ACT II.,Thou hast shown me wonders: thou hast shown me those
12414,ACT II.,Mighty Pre-Adamites who walked the earth
12415,ACT II.,Of which ours is the wreck: thou hast pointed out                  360
12416,ACT II.,"Myriads of starry worlds, of which our own"
12417,ACT II.,"Is the dim and remote companion, in"
12418,ACT II.,Infinity of life: thou hast shown me shadows
12419,ACT II.,Of that existence with the dreaded name
12420,ACT II.,Which my sire brought us--Death;[cj] thou hast shown me much
12421,ACT II.,"But not all: show me where Jehovah dwells,"
12422,ACT II.,In his especial Paradise--or _thine_:
12423,ACT II.,Where is it?
12424,ACT II.,
12425,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.     _Here_, and o'er all space."
12426,ACT II.,
12427,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                    But ye
12428,ACT II.,Have some allotted dwelling--as all things;
12429,ACT II.,"Clay has its earth, and other worlds their tenants;                370"
12430,ACT II.,All temporary breathing creatures their
12431,ACT II.,Peculiar element; and things which have
12432,ACT II.,"Long ceased to breathe _our_ breath, have theirs, thou say'st;"
12433,ACT II.,And the Jehovah and thyself have thine--
12434,ACT II.,Ye do not dwell together?
12435,ACT II.,
12436,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.                No, we reign"
12437,ACT II.,Together; but our dwellings are asunder.
12438,ACT II.,
12439,ACT II.,_Cain_. Would there were only one of ye! perchance
12440,ACT II.,An unity of purpose might make union
12441,ACT II.,In elements which seem now jarred in storms.
12442,ACT II.,"How came ye, being Spirits wise and infinite,                      380"
12443,ACT II.,To separate? Are ye not as brethren in
12444,ACT II.,"Your essence--and your nature, and your glory?"
12445,ACT II.,
12446,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Art not thou Abel's brother?
12447,ACT II.,
12448,ACT II.,"_Cain_.                                 We are brethren,"
12449,ACT II.,"And so we shall remain; but were it not so,"
12450,ACT II.,Is spirit like to flesh? can it fall out--
12451,ACT II.,Infinity with Immortality?
12452,ACT II.,Jarring and turning space to misery--
12453,ACT II.,For what?
12454,ACT II.,
12455,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. To reign.
12456,ACT II.,
12457,ACT II.,_Cain_.              Did ye not tell me that
12458,ACT II.,Ye are both eternal?
12459,ACT II.,
12460,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.           Yea!
12461,ACT II.,
12462,ACT II.,
12463,ACT II.,_Cain_.                  And what I have seen--
12464,ACT II.,"Yon blue immensity, is boundless?"
12465,ACT II.,
12466,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                        Aye.                             390
12467,ACT II.,"_Cain_. And cannot ye both _reign_, then?--is there not"
12468,ACT II.,Enough?--why should ye differ?
12469,ACT II.,
12470,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                     We _both_ reign.
12471,ACT II.,
12472,ACT II.,_Cain_. But one of you makes evil.
12473,ACT II.,
12474,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                         Which?
12475,ACT II.,
12476,ACT II.,_Cain_.                                  Thou! for
12477,ACT II.,"If thou canst do man good, why dost thou not?"
12478,ACT II.,
12479,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And why not he who made? _I_ made ye not;
12480,ACT II.,"Ye are _his_ creatures, and not mine."
12481,ACT II.,
12482,ACT II.,_Cain_.                              Then leave us
12483,ACT II.,"_His_ creatures, as thou say'st we are, or show me"
12484,ACT II.,"Thy dwelling, or _his_ dwelling."
12485,ACT II.,
12486,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                      I could show thee
12487,ACT II.,Both; but the time will come thou shalt see one
12488,ACT II.,Of them for evermore.[120]
12489,ACT II.,
12490,ACT II.,_Cain_.                And why not now?                            400
12491,ACT II.,
12492,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. Thy human mind hath scarcely grasp to gather
12493,ACT II.,The little I have shown thee into calm
12494,ACT II.,And clear thought: and _thou_ wouldst go on aspiring
12495,ACT II.,To the great double Mysteries! the _two Principles_![121]
12496,ACT II.,And gaze upon them on their secret thrones!
12497,ACT II.,Dust! limit thy ambition; for to see
12498,ACT II.,Either of these would be for thee to perish!
12499,ACT II.,
12500,ACT II.,"_Cain_. And let me perish, so I see them!"
12501,ACT II.,
12502,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                                There
12503,ACT II.,The son of her who snatched the apple spake!
12504,ACT II.,"But thou wouldst only perish, and not see them;                    410"
12505,ACT II.,That sight is for the other state.
12506,ACT II.,
12507,ACT II.,_Cain_.                            Of Death?
12508,ACT II.,
12509,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. That is the prelude.
12510,ACT II.,
12511,ACT II.,"_Cain_.                         Then I dread it less,"
12512,ACT II.,Now that I know it leads to something definite.
12513,ACT II.,
12514,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_. And now I will convey thee to thy world,"
12515,ACT II.,"Where thou shall multiply the race of Adam,"
12516,ACT II.,"Eat, drink, toil, tremble, laugh, weep, sleep--and die!"
12517,ACT II.,
12518,ACT II.,_Cain_. And to what end have I beheld these things
12519,ACT II.,Which thou hast shown me?
12520,ACT II.,
12521,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                Didst thou not require
12522,ACT II.,"Knowledge? And have I not, in what I showed,"
12523,ACT II.,Taught thee to know thyself?
12524,ACT II.,
12525,ACT II.,_Cain_.                      Alas! I seem                          420
12526,ACT II.,Nothing.[122]
12527,ACT II.,
12528,ACT II.,_Lucifer_. And this should be the human sum
12529,ACT II.,"Of knowledge, to know mortal nature's nothingness;"
12530,ACT II.,"Bequeath that science to thy children, and"
12531,ACT II.,'Twill spare them many tortures.
12532,ACT II.,
12533,ACT II.,_Cain_.                          Haughty spirit!
12534,ACT II.,"Thou speak'st it proudly; but thyself, though proud,"
12535,ACT II.,Hast a superior.
12536,ACT II.,
12537,ACT II.,"_Lucifer_.       No! By heaven, which he"
12538,ACT II.,"Holds, and the abyss, and the immensity"
12539,ACT II.,"Of worlds and life, which I hold with him--No!"
12540,ACT II.,I have a Victor--true; but no superior.[123]
12541,ACT II.,Homage he has from all--but none from me:                          430
12542,ACT II.,"I battle it against him, as I battled"
12543,ACT II.,"In highest Heaven--through all Eternity,"
12544,ACT II.,"And the unfathomable gulfs of Hades,"
12545,ACT II.,"And the interminable realms of space,"
12546,ACT II.,"And the infinity of endless ages,"
12547,ACT II.,"All, all, will I dispute! And world by world,"
12548,ACT II.,"And star by star, and universe by universe,"
12549,ACT II.,"Shall tremble in the balance, till the great"
12550,ACT II.,"Conflict shall cease, if ever it shall cease,"
12551,ACT II.,"Which it ne'er shall, till he or I be quenched!                    440"
12552,ACT II.,"And what can quench our immortality,"
12553,ACT II.,Or mutual and irrevocable hate?
12554,ACT II.,He as a conqueror will call the conquered
12555,ACT II.,_Evil_; but what will be the _Good_ he gives?
12556,ACT II.,"Were I the victor, _his_ works would be deemed"
12557,ACT II.,"The only evil ones. And you, ye new"
12558,ACT II.,"And scarce-born mortals, what have been his gifts"
12559,ACT II.,"To you already, in your little world?"
12560,ACT II.,
12561,ACT II.,_Cain_. But few; and some of those but bitter.
12562,ACT II.,
12563,ACT II.,_Lucifer_.                                     Back
12564,ACT II.,"With me, then, to thine earth, and try the rest                    450"
12565,ACT II.,Of his celestial boons to you and yours.
12566,ACT II.,"Evil and Good are things in their own essence,"
12567,ACT II.,And not made good or evil by the Giver;
12568,ACT II.,But if he gives you good--so call him; if
12569,ACT II.,"Evil springs from _him_, do not name it _mine_,"
12570,ACT II.,Till ye know better its true fount; and judge
12571,ACT II.,"Not by words, though of Spirits, but the fruits"
12572,ACT II.,"Of your existence, such as it must be."
12573,ACT II.,"_One good_ gift has the fatal apple given,--"
12574,ACT II.,Your _reason_:--let it not be overswayed                           460
12575,ACT II.,By tyrannous threats to force you into faith
12576,ACT II.,'Gainst all external sense and inward feeling:
12577,ACT II.,"Think and endure,--and form an inner world"
12578,ACT II.,In your own bosom--where the outward fails;
12579,ACT II.,So shall you nearer be the spiritual
12580,ACT II.,"Nature, and war triumphant with your own."
12581,ACT II.,[_They disappear_.
12582,ACT II.,
12583,ACT II.,
12584,ACT II.,
12585,ACT II.,
12586,ACT III.,ACT III.
12587,ACT III.,
12588,ACT III.,
12589,ACT III.,"SCENE I.--_The Earth, near Eden, as in Act I_."
12590,ACT III.,
12591,ACT III.,_Enter_ CAIN _and_ ADAH.
12592,ACT III.,
12593,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Hush! tread softly, Cain!"
12594,ACT III.,
12595,ACT III.,_Cain_.                           I will--but wherefore?
12596,ACT III.,
12597,ACT III.,_Adah_. Our little Enoch sleeps upon yon bed
12598,ACT III.,"Of leaves, beneath the cypress."
12599,ACT III.,
12600,ACT III.,_Cain_.                         Cypress! 'tis
12601,ACT III.,"A gloomy tree, which looks as if it mourned"
12602,ACT III.,O'er what it shadows; wherefore didst thou choose it
12603,ACT III.,For our child's canopy?
12604,ACT III.,
12605,ACT III.,_Adah_.                 Because its branches
12606,ACT III.,"Shut out the sun like night, and therefore seemed"
12607,ACT III.,Fitting to shadow slumber.
12608,ACT III.,
12609,ACT III.,"_Cain_.                    Aye, the last--"
12610,ACT III.,And longest; but no matter--lead me to him.
12611,ACT III.,[_They go up to the child_.
12612,ACT III.,"How lovely he appears! his little cheeks,                           10"
12613,ACT III.,"In their pure incarnation,[124] vying with"
12614,ACT III.,The rose leaves strewn beneath them.
12615,ACT III.,
12616,ACT III.,"_Adah_.                              And his lips, too,"
12617,ACT III.,How beautifully parted! No; you shall not
12618,ACT III.,"Kiss him, at least not now: he will awake soon--"
12619,ACT III.,His hour of mid-day rest is nearly over;
12620,ACT III.,But it were pity to disturb him till
12621,ACT III.,'Tis closed.
12622,ACT III.,
12623,ACT III.,_Cain_.     You have said well; I will contain
12624,ACT III.,"My heart till then. He smiles, and sleeps!--sleep on,"
12625,ACT III.,"And smile, thou little, young inheritor"
12626,ACT III.,"Of a world scarce less young: sleep on, and smile!                  20"
12627,ACT III.,Thine are the hours and days when both are cheering
12628,ACT III.,And innocent! _thou_ hast not plucked the fruit--
12629,ACT III.,Thou know'st not thou art naked! Must the time
12630,ACT III.,"Come thou shalt be amerced for sins unknown,"
12631,ACT III.,Which were not thine nor mine? But now sleep on!
12632,ACT III.,"His cheeks are reddening into deeper smiles,"
12633,ACT III.,And shining lids are trembling o'er his long
12634,ACT III.,"Lashes,[125] dark as the cypress which waves o'er them;"
12635,ACT III.,"Half open, from beneath them the clear blue"
12636,ACT III.,"Laughs out, although in slumber. He must dream--                    30"
12637,ACT III.,"Of what? Of Paradise!--Aye! dream of it,"
12638,ACT III.,My disinherited boy! 'Tis but a dream;
12639,ACT III.,"For never more thyself, thy sons, nor fathers,"
12640,ACT III.,Shall walk in that forbidden place of joy!
12641,ACT III.,
12642,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Dear Cain! Nay, do not whisper o'er our son"
12643,ACT III.,Such melancholy yearnings o'er the past:
12644,ACT III.,Why wilt thou always mourn for Paradise?
12645,ACT III.,Can we not make another?
12646,ACT III.,
12647,ACT III.,_Cain_.                  Where?
12648,ACT III.,
12649,ACT III.,"_Adah_.                        Here, or"
12650,ACT III.,"Where'er thou wilt: where'er thou art, I feel not"
12651,ACT III.,The want of this so much regretted Eden.                            40
12652,ACT III.,"Have I not thee--our boy--our sire, and brother,"
12653,ACT III.,"And Zillah--our sweet sister, and our Eve,"
12654,ACT III.,To whom we owe so much besides our birth?
12655,ACT III.,
12656,ACT III.,"_Cain_. Yes--Death, too, is amongst the debts we owe her."
12657,ACT III.,
12658,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Cain! that proud Spirit, who withdrew thee hence,"
12659,ACT III.,Hath saddened thine still deeper. I had hoped
12660,ACT III.,"The promised wonders which thou hast beheld,"
12661,ACT III.,"Visions, thou say'st, of past and present worlds,"
12662,ACT III.,Would have composed thy mind into the calm
12663,ACT III.,Of a contented knowledge; but I see                                 50
12664,ACT III.,"Thy guide hath done thee evil: still I thank him,"
12665,ACT III.,"And can forgive him all, that he so soon"
12666,ACT III.,Hath given thee back to us.
12667,ACT III.,
12668,ACT III.,_Cain_.                     So soon?
12669,ACT III.,
12670,ACT III.,_Adah_.                            'Tis scarcely
12671,ACT III.,Two hours since ye departed: two _long_ hours
12672,ACT III.,"To _me_, but only _hours_ upon the sun."
12673,ACT III.,
12674,ACT III.,"_Cain_. And yet I have approached that sun, and seen"
12675,ACT III.,"Worlds which he once shone on, and never more"
12676,ACT III.,Shall light; and worlds he never lit: methought
12677,ACT III.,Years had rolled o'er my absence.
12678,ACT III.,
12679,ACT III.,_Adah_.                           Hardly hours.
12680,ACT III.,
12681,ACT III.,"_Cain_. The mind then hath capacity of time,                        60"
12682,ACT III.,"And measures it by that which it beholds,"
12683,ACT III.,Pleasing or painful[126]; little or almighty.
12684,ACT III.,I had beheld the immemorial works
12685,ACT III.,Of endless beings; skirred extinguished worlds;
12686,ACT III.,"And, gazing on eternity, methought"
12687,ACT III.,I had borrowed more by a few drops of ages
12688,ACT III.,From its immensity: but now I feel
12689,ACT III.,"My littleness again. Well said the Spirit,"
12690,ACT III.,That I was nothing!
12691,ACT III.,
12692,ACT III.,_Adah_.             Wherefore said he so?
12693,ACT III.,Jehovah said not that.
12694,ACT III.,
12695,ACT III.,_Cain_.                No: _he_ contents him                        70
12696,ACT III.,With making us the _nothing_ which we are;
12697,ACT III.,And after flattering dust with glimpses of
12698,ACT III.,"Eden and Immortality, resolves"
12699,ACT III.,It back to dust again--for what?
12700,ACT III.,
12701,ACT III.,_Adah_.                          Thou know'st--
12702,ACT III.,Even for our parents' error.
12703,ACT III.,
12704,ACT III.,_Cain_.                      What is that
12705,ACT III.,"To us? they sinned, then _let them_ die!"
12706,ACT III.,
12707,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Thou hast not spoken well, nor is that thought"
12708,ACT III.,"Thy own, but of the Spirit who was with thee."
12709,ACT III.,"Would _I_ could die for them, so _they_ might live!"
12710,ACT III.,
12711,ACT III.,"_Cain_. Why, so say I--provided that one victim                     80"
12712,ACT III.,"Might satiate the Insatiable of life,"
12713,ACT III.,And that our little rosy sleeper there
12714,ACT III.,"Might never taste of death nor human sorrow,"
12715,ACT III.,Nor hand it down to those who spring from him.
12716,ACT III.,
12717,ACT III.,_Adah_. How know we that some such atonement one day
12718,ACT III.,May not redeem our race?
12719,ACT III.,
12720,ACT III.,_Cain_.                   By sacrificing
12721,ACT III.,The harmless for the guilty? what atonement[127]
12722,ACT III.,"Were there? why, _we_ are innocent: what have we"
12723,ACT III.,"Done, that we must be victims for a deed"
12724,ACT III.,"Before our birth, or need have victims to                           90"
12725,ACT III.,"Atone for this mysterious, nameless sin--"
12726,ACT III.,If it be such a sin to seek for knowledge?
12727,ACT III.,
12728,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Alas! thou sinnest now, my Cain: thy words"
12729,ACT III.,Sound impious in mine ears.
12730,ACT III.,
12731,ACT III.,_Cain_.                     Then leave me!
12732,ACT III.,
12733,ACT III.,"_Adah_.                                   Never,"
12734,ACT III.,Though thy God left thee.
12735,ACT III.,
12736,ACT III.,"_Cain_.                   Say, what have we here?"
12737,ACT III.,
12738,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Two altars, which our brother Abel made"
12739,ACT III.,"During thine absence, whereupon to offer"
12740,ACT III.,A sacrifice to God on thy return.
12741,ACT III.,
12742,ACT III.,"_Cain_. And how knew _he_, that _I_ would be so ready"
12743,ACT III.,"With the burnt offerings, which he daily brings                    100"
12744,ACT III.,"With a meek brow, whose base humility"
12745,ACT III.,Shows more of fear than worship--as a bribe
12746,ACT III.,To the Creator?
12747,ACT III.,
12748,ACT III.,"_Adah_.         Surely, 'tis well done."
12749,ACT III.,
12750,ACT III.,_Cain_. One altar may suffice; _I_ have no offering.
12751,ACT III.,
12752,ACT III.,"_Adah_. The fruits of the earth,[128] the early, beautiful,"
12753,ACT III.,Blossom and bud--and bloom of flowers and fruits--
12754,ACT III.,"These are a goodly offering to the Lord,"
12755,ACT III.,Given with a gentle and a contrite spirit.
12756,ACT III.,
12757,ACT III.,"_Cain_. I have toiled, and tilled, and sweaten in the sun,"
12758,ACT III.,According to the curse:--must I do more?                           110
12759,ACT III.,For what should I be gentle? for a war
12760,ACT III.,With all the elements ere they will yield
12761,ACT III.,The bread we eat? For what must I be grateful?
12762,ACT III.,"For being dust, and grovelling in the dust,"
12763,ACT III.,Till I return to dust? If I am nothing--
12764,ACT III.,"For nothing shall I be an hypocrite,"
12765,ACT III.,And seem well-pleased with pain? For what should I
12766,ACT III.,"Be contrite? for my father's sin, already"
12767,ACT III.,"Expiate with what we all have undergone,"
12768,ACT III.,And to be more than expiated by                                    120
12769,ACT III.,"The ages prophesied, upon our seed."
12770,ACT III.,"Little deems our young blooming sleeper, there,"
12771,ACT III.,The germs of an eternal misery
12772,ACT III.,To myriads is within him! better 'twere
12773,ACT III.,"I snatched him in his sleep, and dashed him 'gainst"
12774,ACT III.,"The rocks, than let him live to----"
12775,ACT III.,
12776,ACT III.,"_Adah_.                            Oh, my God!"
12777,ACT III.,"Touch not the child--my child! _thy_ child! Oh, Cain!"
12778,ACT III.,
12779,ACT III.,"_Cain_. Fear not! for all the stars, and all the power"
12780,ACT III.,"Which sways them, I would not accost yon infant"
12781,ACT III.,With ruder greeting than a father's kiss.                          130
12782,ACT III.,
12783,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Then, why so awful in thy speech?"
12784,ACT III.,
12785,ACT III.,"_Cain_.                                  I said,"
12786,ACT III.,"'Twere better that he ceased to live, than give"
12787,ACT III.,Life to so much of sorrow as he must
12788,ACT III.,"Endure, and, harder still, bequeath; but since"
12789,ACT III.,"That saying jars you, let us only say--"
12790,ACT III.,'Twere better that he never had been born.
12791,ACT III.,
12792,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Oh, do not say so! Where were then the joys,"
12793,ACT III.,"The mother's joys of watching, nourishing,"
12794,ACT III.,And loving him? Soft! he awakes. Sweet Enoch!
12795,ACT III.,[_She goes to the child_.
12796,ACT III.,"Oh, Cain! look on him; see how full of life,                       140"
12797,ACT III.,"Of strength, of bloom, of beauty, and of joy--"
12798,ACT III.,"How like to me--how like to thee, when gentle--"
12799,ACT III.,"For _then_ we are _all_ alike; is't not so, Cain?"
12800,ACT III.,"Mother, and sire, and son, our features are"
12801,ACT III.,Reflected in each other; as they are
12802,ACT III.,"In the clear waters, when _they_ are _gentle_, and"
12803,ACT III.,"When _thou_ art _gentle_. Love us, then, my Cain!"
12804,ACT III.,"And love thyself for our sakes, for we love thee."
12805,ACT III.,"Look! how he laughs and stretches out his arms,"
12806,ACT III.,"And opens wide his blue eyes upon thine,                           150"
12807,ACT III.,To hail his father; while his little form
12808,ACT III.,Flutters as winged with joy. Talk not of pain!
12809,ACT III.,The childless cherubs well might envy thee
12810,ACT III.,"The pleasures of a parent! Bless him, Cain!"
12811,ACT III.,"As yet he hath no words to thank thee, but"
12812,ACT III.,"His heart will, and thine own too."
12813,ACT III.,
12814,ACT III.,"_Cain_.                            Bless thee, boy!"
12815,ACT III.,"If that a mortal blessing may avail thee,"
12816,ACT III.,To save thee from the Serpent's curse!
12817,ACT III.,
12818,ACT III.,_Adah_.                              It shall.
12819,ACT III.,Surely a father's blessing may avert
12820,ACT III.,A reptile's subtlety.
12821,ACT III.,
12822,ACT III.,_Cain_.             Of that I doubt;                               160
12823,ACT III.,But bless him ne'er the less.
12824,ACT III.,
12825,ACT III.,_Adah_.                       Our brother comes.
12826,ACT III.,
12827,ACT III.,_Cain_. Thy brother Abel.
12828,ACT III.,
12829,ACT III.,_Enter_ ABEL.
12830,ACT III.,
12831,ACT III.,"_Abel_.                   Welcome, Cain! My brother,"
12832,ACT III.,The peace of God be on thee!
12833,ACT III.,
12834,ACT III.,"_Cain_.                      Abel, hail!"
12835,ACT III.,
12836,ACT III.,"_Abel_. Our sister tells me that thou hast been wandering,"
12837,ACT III.,"In high communion with a Spirit, far"
12838,ACT III.,Beyond our wonted range. Was he of those
12839,ACT III.,"We have seen and spoken with, like to our father?"
12840,ACT III.,
12841,ACT III.,_Cain_. No.
12842,ACT III.,
12843,ACT III.,_Abel_.     Why then commune with him? he may be
12844,ACT III.,A foe to the Most High.
12845,ACT III.,
12846,ACT III.,_Cain_.                 And friend to man.
12847,ACT III.,Has the Most High been so--if so you term him?                     170
12848,ACT III.,
12849,ACT III.,"_Abel_. _Term him!_ your words are strange to-day, my brother."
12850,ACT III.,"My sister Adah, leave us for awhile--"
12851,ACT III.,We mean to sacrifice[129].
12852,ACT III.,
12853,ACT III.,"_Adah_.                  Farewell, my Cain;"
12854,ACT III.,"But first embrace thy son. May his soft spirit,"
12855,ACT III.,"And Abel's pious ministry, recall thee"
12856,ACT III.,"To peace and holiness!                 [_Exit_ ADAH, _with her child_."
12857,ACT III.,
12858,ACT III.,_Abel_.                Where hast thou been?
12859,ACT III.,
12860,ACT III.,_Cain_. I know not.
12861,ACT III.,
12862,ACT III.,_Abel_.             Nor what thou hast seen?
12863,ACT III.,
12864,ACT III.,_Cain_.                                     The dead--
12865,ACT III.,The Immortal--the Unbounded--the Omnipotent--
12866,ACT III.,The overpowering mysteries of space--
12867,ACT III.,The innumerable worlds that were and are--                         180
12868,ACT III.,"A whirlwind of such overwhelming things,"
12869,ACT III.,"Suns, moons, and earths, upon their loud-voiced spheres"
12870,ACT III.,"Singing in thunder round me, as have made me"
12871,ACT III.,"Unfit for mortal converse: leave me, Abel."
12872,ACT III.,
12873,ACT III.,_Abel_. Thine eyes are flashing with unnatural light--
12874,ACT III.,Thy cheek is flushed with an unnatural hue--
12875,ACT III.,Thy words are fraught with an unnatural sound--
12876,ACT III.,What may this mean?
12877,ACT III.,
12878,ACT III.,"_Cain_.            It means--I pray thee, leave me."
12879,ACT III.,
12880,ACT III.,_Abel_. Not till we have prayed and sacrificed together.
12881,ACT III.,
12882,ACT III.,"_Cain_. Abel, I pray thee, sacrifice alone--                       190"
12883,ACT III.,Jehovah loves thee well.
12884,ACT III.,
12885,ACT III.,"_Abel_.                  _Both_ well, I hope."
12886,ACT III.,
12887,ACT III.,_Cain_. But thee the better: I care not for that;
12888,ACT III.,Thou art fitter for his worship than I am;
12889,ACT III.,"Revere him, then--but let it be alone--"
12890,ACT III.,"At least, without me."
12891,ACT III.,
12892,ACT III.,"_Abel_.               Brother, I should ill"
12893,ACT III.,"Deserve the name of our great father's son,"
12894,ACT III.,"If, as my elder, I revered thee not,"
12895,ACT III.,"And in the worship of our God, called not"
12896,ACT III.,"On thee to join me, and precede me in"
12897,ACT III.,Our priesthood--'tis thy place.
12898,ACT III.,
12899,ACT III.,_Cain_.                         But I have ne'er                   200
12900,ACT III.,Asserted it.
12901,ACT III.,
12902,ACT III.,_Abel_.      The more my grief; I pray thee
12903,ACT III.,To do so now: thy soul seems labouring in
12904,ACT III.,Some strong delusion; it will calm thee.
12905,ACT III.,
12906,ACT III.,_Cain_.                                  No;
12907,ACT III.,Nothing can calm me more. _Calm!_ say I? Never
12908,ACT III.,"Knew I what calm was in the soul, although"
12909,ACT III.,"I have seen the elements stilled. My Abel, leave me!"
12910,ACT III.,Or let me leave thee to thy pious purpose.
12911,ACT III.,
12912,ACT III.,_Abel_. Neither; we must perform our task together.
12913,ACT III.,Spurn me not.
12914,ACT III.,
12915,ACT III.,"_Cain_.       If it must be so----well, then,"
12916,ACT III.,What shall I do?
12917,ACT III.,
12918,ACT III.,_Abel_.          Choose one of those two altars.                   210
12919,ACT III.,
12920,ACT III.,_Cain_. Choose for me: they to me are so much turf
12921,ACT III.,And stone.
12922,ACT III.,
12923,ACT III.,_Abel_.    Choose thou!
12924,ACT III.,
12925,ACT III.,_Cain_.                I have chosen.
12926,ACT III.,
12927,ACT III.,"_Abel_.                              'Tis the highest,"
12928,ACT III.,"And suits thee, as the elder. Now prepare"
12929,ACT III.,Thine offerings.
12930,ACT III.,
12931,ACT III.,_Cain_.         Where are thine?
12932,ACT III.,
12933,ACT III.,_Abel_.                         Behold them here--
12934,ACT III.,"The firstlings of the flock, and fat thereof--"
12935,ACT III.,A shepherd's humble offering.
12936,ACT III.,
12937,ACT III.,_Cain_.                      I have no flocks;
12938,ACT III.,"I am a tiller of the ground, and must"
12939,ACT III.,Yield what it yieldeth to my toil--its fruit:
12940,ACT III.,[_He gathers fruits_.
12941,ACT III.,Behold them in their various bloom and ripeness.
12942,ACT III.,"[_They dress their altars, and kindle aflame upon them_[130]."
12943,ACT III.,
12944,ACT III.,"_Abel_. My brother, as the elder, offer first                      220"
12945,ACT III.,Thy prayer and thanksgiving with sacrifice.
12946,ACT III.,
12947,ACT III.,"_Cain_. No--I am new to this; lead thou the way,"
12948,ACT III.,And I will follow--as I may.
12949,ACT III.,
12950,ACT III.,"_Abel_ (_kneeling_).       Oh, God!"
12951,ACT III.,"Who made us, and who breathed the breath of life"
12952,ACT III.,"Within our nostrils, who hath blessed us,"
12953,ACT III.,"And spared, despite our father's sin, to make"
12954,ACT III.,"His children all lost, as they might have been,"
12955,ACT III.,Had not thy justice been so tempered with
12956,ACT III.,"The mercy which is thy delight, as to"
12957,ACT III.,"Accord a pardon like a Paradise,                                   230"
12958,ACT III.,Compared with our great crimes:--Sole Lord of light!
12959,ACT III.,"Of good, and glory, and eternity!"
12960,ACT III.,"Without whom all were evil, and with whom"
12961,ACT III.,"Nothing can err, except to some good end"
12962,ACT III.,Of thine omnipotent benevolence!
12963,ACT III.,"Inscrutable, but still to be fulfilled!"
12964,ACT III.,Accept from out thy humble first of shepherds'
12965,ACT III.,"First of the first-born flocks--an offering,"
12966,ACT III.,In itself nothing--as what offering can be
12967,ACT III.,Aught unto thee?--but yet accept it for                            240
12968,ACT III.,The thanksgiving of him who spreads it in
12969,ACT III.,The face of thy high heaven--bowing his own
12970,ACT III.,"Even to the dust, of which he is--in honour"
12971,ACT III.,"Of thee, and of thy name, for evermore!"
12972,ACT III.,
12973,ACT III.,_Cain_ (_standing erect during this speech_).
12974,ACT III.,"Spirit whate'er or whosoe'er thou art,"
12975,ACT III.,"Omnipotent, it may be--and, if good,"
12976,ACT III.,Shown in the exemption of thy deeds from evil;
12977,ACT III.,Jehovah upon earth! and God in heaven!
12978,ACT III.,"And it may be with other names, because"
12979,ACT III.,"Thine attributes seem many, as thy works:--                        250"
12980,ACT III.,"If thou must be propitiated with prayers,"
12981,ACT III.,"Take them! If thou must be induced with altars,"
12982,ACT III.,"And softened with a sacrifice, receive them;"
12983,ACT III.,Two beings here erect them unto thee.
12984,ACT III.,"If thou lov'st blood, the shepherd's shrine, which smokes"
12985,ACT III.,"On my right hand, hath shed it for thy service"
12986,ACT III.,"In the first of his flock, whose limbs now reek"
12987,ACT III.,In sanguinary incense to thy skies;
12988,ACT III.,"Or, if the sweet and blooming fruits of earth,"
12989,ACT III.,"And milder seasons, which the unstained turf                       260"
12990,ACT III.,I spread them on now offers in the face
12991,ACT III.,"Of the broad sun which ripened them, may seem"
12992,ACT III.,Good to thee--inasmuch as they have not
12993,ACT III.,Suffered in limb or life--and rather form
12994,ACT III.,"A sample of thy works, than supplication"
12995,ACT III.,"To look on ours! If a shrine without victim,"
12996,ACT III.,"And altar without gore, may win thy favour,"
12997,ACT III.,"Look on it! and for him who dresseth it,"
12998,ACT III.,He is--such as thou mad'st him; and seeks nothing
12999,ACT III.,"Which must be won by kneeling: if he's evil[ck],                   270"
13000,ACT III.,"Strike him! thou art omnipotent, and may'st--"
13001,ACT III.,"For what can he oppose? If he be good,"
13002,ACT III.,"Strike him, or spare him, as thou wilt! since all"
13003,ACT III.,Rests upon thee; and Good and Evil seem
13004,ACT III.,"To have no power themselves, save in thy will--"
13005,ACT III.,"And whether that be good or ill I know not,"
13006,ACT III.,"Not being omnipotent, nor fit to judge"
13007,ACT III.,Omnipotence--but merely to endure
13008,ACT III.,Its mandate; which thus far I have endured.
13009,ACT III.,
13010,ACT III.,[_The fire upon the altar of_ ABEL _kindles into a column
13011,ACT III.,"of the brightest flame, and ascends to heaven;"
13012,ACT III.,while a whirlwind throws down the altar of_
13013,ACT III.,"CAIN, _and scatters the fruits abroad"
13014,ACT III.,upon the earths_[131]
13015,ACT III.,
13016,ACT III.,_Abel_ (_kneeling_).
13017,ACT III.,"Oh, brother, pray! Jehovah's wroth with thee.                      280"
13018,ACT III.,
13019,ACT III.,_Cain_. Why so?
13020,ACT III.,
13021,ACT III.,_Abel_.         Thy fruits are scattered on the earth.
13022,ACT III.,
13023,ACT III.,"_Cain_. From earth they came, to earth let them return;"
13024,ACT III.,Their seed will bear fresh fruit there ere the summer:
13025,ACT III.,Thy burnt flesh-offering prospers better; see
13026,ACT III.,"How Heaven licks up the flames, when thick with blood!"
13027,ACT III.,
13028,ACT III.,"_Abel_. Think not upon my offering's acceptance,"
13029,ACT III.,But make another of thine own--before
13030,ACT III.,It is too late.
13031,ACT III.,
13032,ACT III.,"_Cain_.        I will build no more altars,"
13033,ACT III.,Nor suffer any----
13034,ACT III.,
13035,ACT III.,_Abel_ (_rising_). Cain! what meanest thou?
13036,ACT III.,
13037,ACT III.,"_Cain_. To cast down yon vile flatterer of the clouds,             290"
13038,ACT III.,The smoky harbinger of thy dull prayers--
13039,ACT III.,"Thine altar, with its blood of lambs and kids,"
13040,ACT III.,"Which fed on milk, to be destroyed in blood."
13041,ACT III.,
13042,ACT III.,_Abel_ (_opposing him_).
13043,ACT III.,Thou shalt not:--add not impious works to impious
13044,ACT III.,Words! let that altar stand--'tis hallowed now
13045,ACT III.,"By the immortal pleasure of Jehovah,"
13046,ACT III.,In his acceptance of the victims.
13047,ACT III.,
13048,ACT III.,_Cain_.                         _His_!
13049,ACT III.,_His pleasure!_ what was his high pleasure in
13050,ACT III.,"The fumes of scorching flesh and smoking blood,"
13051,ACT III.,"To the pain of the bleating mothers, which                         300"
13052,ACT III.,Still yearn for their dead offspring? or the pangs
13053,ACT III.,Of the sad ignorant victims underneath
13054,ACT III.,Thy pious knife? Give way! this bloody record
13055,ACT III.,"Shall not stand in the sun, to shame creation!"
13056,ACT III.,
13057,ACT III.,"_Abel_. Brother, give back! thou shalt not touch my altar"
13058,ACT III.,"With violence: if that thou wilt adopt it,"
13059,ACT III.,"To try another sacrifice, 'tis thine."
13060,ACT III.,
13061,ACT III.,"_Cain_. Another sacrifice! Give way, or else"
13062,ACT III.,That sacrifice may be----
13063,ACT III.,
13064,ACT III.,_Abel_.                   What mean'st thou?
13065,ACT III.,
13066,ACT III.,_Cain_.                                     Give--
13067,ACT III.,Give way!--thy God loves blood!--then look to it:--                310
13068,ACT III.,"Give way, ere he hath _more_!"
13069,ACT III.,
13070,ACT III.,"_Abel_.                      In _his_ great name,"
13071,ACT III.,I stand between thee and the shrine which hath
13072,ACT III.,Had his acceptance.
13073,ACT III.,
13074,ACT III.,"_Cain_.            If thou lov'st thyself,"
13075,ACT III.,Stand back till I have strewed this turf along
13076,ACT III.,Its native soil:--else----
13077,ACT III.,
13078,ACT III.,_Abel_ (_opposing him_).   I love God far more
13079,ACT III.,Than life.
13080,ACT III.,
13081,ACT III.,"_Cain_ (_striking him with a brand, on the temples, which"
13082,ACT III.,"he snatches from the altar_). Then take thy life unto thy God,"
13083,ACT III.,Since he loves lives.
13084,ACT III.,
13085,ACT III.,_Abel_ (_falls_). What hast thou done--my brother?
13086,ACT III.,
13087,ACT III.,_Cain_. Brother!
13088,ACT III.,
13089,ACT III.,"_Abel_.          Oh, God! receive thy servant! and"
13090,ACT III.,"Forgive his slayer, for he knew not what"
13091,ACT III.,"He did--Cain, give me--give me thy hand; and tell                  320"
13092,ACT III.,Poor Zillah--
13093,ACT III.,
13094,ACT III.,_Cain_ (_after a moment's stupefaction_).
13095,ACT III.,"_My_ hand! 'tis all red, and with----"
13096,ACT III.,What?                          [_A long pause.--Looking slowly round_.
13097,ACT III.,Where am I? alone! Where's Abel? where
13098,ACT III.,"Cain? Can it be that I am he? My brother,"
13099,ACT III.,Awake!--why liest thou so long on the green earth?
13100,ACT III.,'Tis not the hour of slumber:--why so pale?
13101,ACT III.,What hast thou!--thou wert full of life this morn!
13102,ACT III.,"Abel! I pray thee, mock me not! I smote"
13103,ACT III.,"Too fiercely, but not fatally. Ah, why"
13104,ACT III.,Wouldst thou oppose me? This is mockery;
13105,ACT III.,And only done to daunt me:--'twas a blow--                         330
13106,ACT III.,"And but a blow. Stir--stir--nay, only stir!"
13107,ACT III.,"Why, so--that's well!--thou breathest! breathe upon me!"
13108,ACT III.,Oh God! Oh God!
13109,ACT III.,
13110,ACT III.,_Abel_ (_very faintly_). What's he who speaks of God?
13111,ACT III.,
13112,ACT III.,_Cain_. Thy murderer.
13113,ACT III.,
13114,ACT III.,"_Abel_.               Then may God forgive him! Cain,"
13115,ACT III.,Comfort poor Zillah:--she has but one brother
13116,ACT III.,Now.                                                     [ABEL _dies_.
13117,ACT III.,
13118,ACT III.,_Cain_. And I none!--Who makes me brotherless?
13119,ACT III.,His eyes are open! then he is not dead!
13120,ACT III.,Death is like sleep[132]; and sleep shuts down our lids.
13121,ACT III.,"His lips, too, are apart; why then he breathes;"
13122,ACT III.,And yet I feel it not.--His heart!--his heart!--                   340
13123,ACT III.,"Let me see, doth it beat? methinks----No!--no!"
13124,ACT III.,"This is a vision, else I am become"
13125,ACT III.,The native of another and worse world.
13126,ACT III.,The earth swims round me:--what is this?--'tis wet;
13127,ACT III.,"[_Puts his hand to his brow, and then looks at it_."
13128,ACT III.,And yet there are no dews! 'Tis blood--my blood--
13129,ACT III.,My brother's and my own! and shed by me!
13130,ACT III.,"Then what have I further to do with life,"
13131,ACT III.,Since I have taken life from my own flesh?
13132,ACT III.,But he can not be dead!--Is silence death?
13133,ACT III.,No; he will wake; then let me watch by him.                        350
13134,ACT III.,"Life cannot be so slight, as to be quenched"
13135,ACT III.,Thus quickly!--he hath spoken to me since--
13136,ACT III.,What shall I say to him?--My brother!--No:
13137,ACT III.,He will not answer to that name; for brethren
13138,ACT III.,Smite not each other. Yet--yet--speak to me.
13139,ACT III.,"Oh! for a word more of that gentle voice,"
13140,ACT III.,That I may bear to hear my own again!
13141,ACT III.,
13142,ACT III.,_Enter_ ZILLAH.
13143,ACT III.,
13144,ACT III.,_Zillah_. I heard a heavy sound; what can it be?
13145,ACT III.,'Tis Cain; and watching by my husband. What
13146,ACT III.,"Dost thou there, brother? Doth he sleep? Oh, Heaven!               360"
13147,ACT III.,"What means this paleness, and yon stream?--No, no!"
13148,ACT III.,It is not blood; for who would shed his blood?
13149,ACT III.,Abel! what's this?--who hath done this? He moves not;
13150,ACT III.,He breathes not: and his hands drop down from mine
13151,ACT III.,With stony lifelessness! Ah! cruel Cain!
13152,ACT III.,Why camest thou not in time to save him from
13153,ACT III.,"This violence? Whatever hath assailed him,"
13154,ACT III.,"Thou wert the stronger, and shouldst have stepped in"
13155,ACT III.,Between him and aggression! Father!--Eve!--
13156,ACT III.,Adah!--come hither! Death is in the world!                         370
13157,ACT III.,"[_Exit_ ZILLAH, _calling on her Parents, etc._"
13158,ACT III.,
13159,ACT III.,_Cain_ (_solus_). And who hath brought him there?--I--who abhor
13160,ACT III.,"The name of Death so deeply, that the thought"
13161,ACT III.,"Empoisoned all my life, before I knew"
13162,ACT III.,"His aspect--I have led him here, and given"
13163,ACT III.,"My brother to his cold and still embrace,"
13164,ACT III.,As if he would not have asserted his
13165,ACT III.,Inexorable claim without my aid.
13166,ACT III.,I am awake at last--a dreary dream
13167,ACT III.,Had maddened me;--but _he_ shall ne'er awake!
13168,ACT III.,
13169,ACT III.,"_Enter_ ADAM, EVE, ADAH, _and_ ZILLAH."
13170,ACT III.,
13171,ACT III.,_Adam_. A voice of woe from Zillah brings me here--                380
13172,ACT III.,What do I see?--'Tis true!--My son!--my son!
13173,ACT III.,"Woman, behold the Serpent's work, and thine!                [_To_ EVE."
13174,ACT III.,
13175,ACT III.,_Eve_. Oh! speak not of it now: the Serpent's fangs
13176,ACT III.,"Are in my heart! My best beloved, Abel!"
13177,ACT III.,Jehovah! this is punishment beyond
13178,ACT III.,"A mother's sin, to take _him_ from me!"
13179,ACT III.,
13180,ACT III.,"_Adam_.                                     Who,"
13181,ACT III.,"Or what hath done this deed?--speak, Cain, since thou"
13182,ACT III.,"Wert present; was it some more hostile angel,"
13183,ACT III.,Who walks not with Jehovah? or some wild
13184,ACT III.,Brute of the forest?
13185,ACT III.,
13186,ACT III.,_Eve_.               Ah! a livid light                             390
13187,ACT III.,"Breaks through, as from a thunder-cloud! yon brand"
13188,ACT III.,"Massy and bloody! snatched from off the altar,"
13189,ACT III.,"And black with smoke, and red with----"
13190,ACT III.,
13191,ACT III.,"_Adam_.                               Speak, my son!"
13192,ACT III.,"Speak, and assure us, wretched as we are,"
13193,ACT III.,That we are not more miserable still.
13194,ACT III.,
13195,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Speak, Cain! and say it was not _thou_!"
13196,ACT III.,
13197,ACT III.,_Eve_.                                          It was!
13198,ACT III.,"I see it now--he hangs his guilty head,"
13199,ACT III.,And covers his ferocious eye with hands
13200,ACT III.,Incarnadine!
13201,ACT III.,
13202,ACT III.,"_Adah_.      Mother, thou dost him wrong--"
13203,ACT III.,"Cain! clear thee from this horrible accusal,                       400"
13204,ACT III.,Which grief wrings from our parent.
13205,ACT III.,
13206,ACT III.,"_Eve_.                              Hear, Jehovah!"
13207,ACT III.,May the eternal Serpent's curse be on him!
13208,ACT III.,For he was fitter for his seed than ours.
13209,ACT III.,May all his days be desolate! May----
13210,ACT III.,
13211,ACT III.,_Adah_.                              Hold!
13212,ACT III.,"Curse him not, mother, for he is thy son--"
13213,ACT III.,"Curse him not, mother, for he is my brother,"
13214,ACT III.,And my betrothed.
13215,ACT III.,
13216,ACT III.,_Eve_.           He hath left thee no brother--
13217,ACT III.,Zillah no husband--me _no son!_ for thus
13218,ACT III.,I curse him from my sight for evermore!
13219,ACT III.,"All bonds I break between us, as he broke                          410"
13220,ACT III.,"That of his nature, _in yon_----Oh Death! Death!"
13221,ACT III.,"Why didst thou not take _me_, who first incurred thee?"
13222,ACT III.,Why dost thou not so now?
13223,ACT III.,
13224,ACT III.,"_Adam_.                   Eve! let not this,"
13225,ACT III.,"Thy natural grief, lead to impiety!"
13226,ACT III.,A heavy doom was long forespoken to us;
13227,ACT III.,"And now that it begins, let it be borne"
13228,ACT III.,"In such sort as may show our God, that we"
13229,ACT III.,Are faithful servants to his holy will.
13230,ACT III.,
13231,ACT III.,_Eve_ (_pointing to Cain_).
13232,ACT III.,_His will!_ the will of yon Incarnate Spirit
13233,ACT III.,"Of Death, whom I have brought upon the earth                       420"
13234,ACT III.,To strew it with the dead. May all the curses
13235,ACT III.,Of life be on him! and his agonies
13236,ACT III.,"Drive him forth o'er the wilderness, like us"
13237,ACT III.,"From Eden, till his children do by him"
13238,ACT III.,As he did by his brother! May the swords
13239,ACT III.,And wings of fiery Cherubim pursue him
13240,ACT III.,By day and night--snakes spring up in his path--
13241,ACT III.,Earth's fruits be ashes in his mouth--the leaves
13242,ACT III.,On which he lays his head to sleep be strewed
13243,ACT III.,With scorpions! May his dreams be of his victim!                   430
13244,ACT III.,His waking a continual dread of Death!
13245,ACT III.,May the clear rivers turn to blood as he[133]
13246,ACT III.,Stoops down to stain them with his raging lip!
13247,ACT III.,May every element shun or change to him!
13248,ACT III.,May he live in the pangs which others die with!
13249,ACT III.,And Death itself wax something worse than Death
13250,ACT III.,To him who first acquainted him with man!
13251,ACT III.,"Hence, fratricide! henceforth that word is _Cain_,"
13252,ACT III.,"Through all the coming myriads of mankind,"
13253,ACT III.,"Who shall abhor thee, though thou wert their sire!                 440"
13254,ACT III.,May the grass wither from thy feet! the woods
13255,ACT III.,Deny thee shelter! earth a home! the dust
13256,ACT III.,A grave! the sun his light! and heaven her God[134]!
13257,ACT III.,[_Exit_ EVE.
13258,ACT III.,
13259,ACT III.,_Adam_. Cain! get thee forth: we dwell no more together.
13260,ACT III.,Depart! and leave the dead to me--I am
13261,ACT III.,Henceforth alone--we never must meet more.
13262,ACT III.,
13263,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Oh, part not with him thus, my father: do not"
13264,ACT III.,Add thy deep curse to Eve's upon his head!
13265,ACT III.,
13266,ACT III.,_Adam_. I curse him not: his spirit be his curse.
13267,ACT III.,"Come, Zillah!"
13268,ACT III.,
13269,ACT III.,_Zillah_.       I must watch my husband's corse[135].              450
13270,ACT III.,
13271,ACT III.,"_Adam_. We will return again, when he is gone"
13272,ACT III.,Who hath provided for us this dread office.
13273,ACT III.,"Come, Zillah!"
13274,ACT III.,
13275,ACT III.,"_Zillah_.    Yet one kiss on yon pale clay,"
13276,ACT III.,And those lips once so warm--my heart! my heart!
13277,ACT III.,[_Exeunt_ ADAM _and_ ZILLAH _weeping_.
13278,ACT III.,
13279,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Cain! thou hast heard, we must go forth. I am ready,"
13280,ACT III.,"So shall our children be. I will bear Enoch,"
13281,ACT III.,And you his sister. Ere the sun declines
13282,ACT III.,"Let us depart, nor walk the wilderness"

13286,ACT III.,_Cain_.             Leave me!
13287,ACT III.,
13288,ACT III.,"_Adah_.                      Why, all have left thee.              460"
13289,ACT III.,
13290,ACT III.,_Cain_. And wherefore lingerest thou? Dost thou not fear
13291,ACT III.,To dwell with one who hath done this?
13292,ACT III.,
13293,ACT III.,_Adah_.                               I fear
13294,ACT III.,"Nothing except to leave thee, much as I"
13295,ACT III.,Shrink from the deed which leaves thee brotherless.
13296,ACT III.,I must not speak of this--it is between thee
13297,ACT III.,And the great God.
13298,ACT III.,
13299,ACT III.,_A Voice from within exclaims_. Cain! Cain!
13300,ACT III.,
13301,ACT III.,_Adah_.                    Hear'st thou that voice?
13302,ACT III.,
13303,ACT III.,_The Voice within_. Cain! Cain!
13304,ACT III.,
13305,ACT III.,_Adah_.                        It soundeth like an angel's tone.
13306,ACT III.,
13307,ACT III.,_Enter the_ ANGEL _of the Lord_.[136]
13308,ACT III.,
13309,ACT III.,_Angel_. Where is thy brother Abel?
13310,ACT III.,
13311,ACT III.,_Cain_.                              Am I then
13312,ACT III.,My brother's keeper?
13313,ACT III.,
13314,ACT III.,_Angel_.            Cain! what hast thou done?
13315,ACT III.,"The voice of thy slain brother's blood cries out,                  470"
13316,ACT III.,"Even from the ground, unto the Lord!--Now art thou"
13317,ACT III.,"Cursed from the earth, which opened late her mouth"
13318,ACT III.,To drink thy brother's blood from thy rash hand.
13319,ACT III.,"Henceforth, when thou shalt till the ground, it shall not"
13320,ACT III.,Yield thee her strength; a fugitive shalt thou
13321,ACT III.,"Be from this day, and vagabond on earth!"
13322,ACT III.,
13323,ACT III.,_Adah_. This punishment is more than he can bear.
13324,ACT III.,"Behold thou drivest him from the face of earth,"
13325,ACT III.,And from the face of God shall he be hid.
13326,ACT III.,"A fugitive and vagabond on earth,                                  480"
13327,ACT III.,"'Twill come to pass, that whoso findeth him"
13328,ACT III.,Shall slay him.
13329,ACT III.,
13330,ACT III.,_Cain_.         Would they could! but who are they
13331,ACT III.,Shall slay me? Where are these on the lone earth
13332,ACT III.,As yet unpeopled?
13333,ACT III.,
13334,ACT III.,"_Angel_.         Thou hast slain thy brother,"
13335,ACT III.,And who shall warrant thee against thy son?
13336,ACT III.,
13337,ACT III.,"_Adah_. Angel of Light! be merciful, nor say"
13338,ACT III.,That this poor aching breast now nourishes
13339,ACT III.,"A murderer in my boy, and of his father."
13340,ACT III.,
13341,ACT III.,_Angel_. Then he would but be what his father is.
13342,ACT III.,Did not the milk of Eve give nutriment                             490
13343,ACT III.,To him thou now seest so besmeared with blood?
13344,ACT III.,The fratricide might well engender parricides.--
13345,ACT III.,But it shall not be so--the Lord thy God

13347,ACT III.,"On Cain, so that he may go forth in safety."
13348,ACT III.,"Who slayeth Cain, a sevenfold vengeance shall"
13349,ACT III.,Be taken on his head. Come hither!
13350,ACT III.,
13351,ACT III.,_Cain_.                            What
13352,ACT III.,Wouldst thou with me?
13353,ACT III.,
13354,ACT III.,_Angel_.              To mark upon thy brow[cl]
13355,ACT III.,Exemption from such deeds as thou hast done.
13356,ACT III.,
13357,ACT III.,"_Cain_. No, let me die!"
13358,ACT III.,

13360,ACT III.,[_The_ ANGEL _sets the mark on_ CAIN'S _brow_.
13361,ACT III.,
13362,ACT III.,_Cain_.                                It burns                    500
13363,ACT III.,"My brow, but nought to that which is within it!"
13364,ACT III.,Is there more? let me meet it as I may.
13365,ACT III.,
13366,ACT III.,"_Angel_. Stern hast thou been and stubborn from the womb,"
13367,ACT III.,As the ground thou must henceforth till; but he
13368,ACT III.,Thou slew'st was gentle as the flocks he tended.
13369,ACT III.,
13370,ACT III.,_Cain_. After the fall too soon was I begotten;
13371,ACT III.,Ere yet my mother's mind subsided from
13372,ACT III.,"The Serpent, and my sire still mourned for Eden."
13373,ACT III.,"That which I am, I am; I did not seek"

13375,ACT III.,With my own death redeem him from the dust--
13376,ACT III.,"And why not so? let him return to day,"
13377,ACT III.,And I lie ghastly! so shall be restored
13378,ACT III.,By God the life to him he loved; and taken
13379,ACT III.,From me a being I ne'er loved to bear.
13380,ACT III.,
13381,ACT III.,"_Angel_. Who shall heal murder? what is done, is done;"
13382,ACT III.,Go forth! fulfil thy days! and be thy deeds

13391,ACT III.,But the four rivers[137] would not cleanse my soul.

13398,ACT III.,Go to our children--I will follow thee.
13399,ACT III.,
13400,ACT III.,_Adah_. I will not leave thee lonely with the dead--
13401,ACT III.,Let us depart together.
13402,ACT III.,

14047,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"1853, iv. 28) was published December 23, 1822. None the less, lyric and"
14048,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,drama were destined to run in double harness. Critics found it
14049,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"convenient to review the two poems in the same article, and were at"
14050,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,pains to draw a series of more or less pointed and pungent comparisons
14051,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,between the unwilling though not unwitting rivals.

14060,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"There is, indeed, apart from the subject, nothing in common between"
14061,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,Moore's tender and alluring lyric and Byron's gloomy and tumultuous
14062,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"rhapsody, while contrast is to be sought rather in the poets than in"
14063,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,their poems. The _Loves of the Angels_ is the finished composition of an

14067,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,
14068,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,Both the one and the other have passed out of the ken of readers of
14069,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"poetry, but, on the whole, the _Loves of the Angels_ has suffered the"
14070,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,greater injustice. It is opined that there may be possibilities in a
14071,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"half-forgotten work of Byron, but it is taken for granted that nothing"
14072,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"worthy of attention is to be found in Moore. At the time, however, Moore"
14073,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"scored a success, and Byron hardly escaped a failure. It is to be noted"
14074,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"that within a month of publication (January 18, 1823) Moore was at work"
14075,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"upon a revise for a fifth edition--consulting D'Herbelot ""for the"
14076,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"project of turning the poor 'Angels' into Turks,"" and so ""getting rid of"
14077,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"that connection with the Scriptures,"" which, so the Longmans feared,"

14079,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"(_Memoirs, etc._, 1853, iv. 41). It was no wonder that Murray was"
14080,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"""timorous"" with regard to Byron and his ""scriptural dramas,"" when the"
14081,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,Longmans started at the shadow of a scriptural allusion.
14082,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,
14083,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"Byron, in his innocence, had taken for his motto the verse in _Genesis_"
14084,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"(ch. vi. 2), which records the intermarriage of the ""sons of God"" with"
14085,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"the ""daughters of men."" In _Heaven and Earth_ the angels _are_ angels,"
14086,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"members, though erring members, of Jehovah's ""thundering choir,"" and the"
14087,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,daughters of men are the descendants of Cain. The question had come up
14088,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,for debate owing to the recent appearance of a translation of the _Book
14089,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"of Enoch_ (by Richard Laurence, LL.D., Oxford, 1821); and Moore, by way"
14090,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,of safeguarding himself against any suspicion of theological
14091,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"irregularity, is careful to assure his readers (""Preface"" to _Loves of"
14092,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"the Angels_, 1823, p. viii. and note, pp. 125-127) that the ""sons of"
14093,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"God"" were the descendants of Seth, and not beings of a supernatural"
14094,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"order, as a mis-translation by the LXX., assisted by Philo and the"
14095,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"""rhapsodical fictions of the _Book of Enoch_"" had induced the ignorant"

14098,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,saved Byron from straying from the path of orthodoxy.
14099,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,
14100,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,It is impossible to say for certain whether Laurence's translation of
14101,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,the whole of the _Book of Enoch_ had come under Byron's notice before he
14102,INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.,"planned his new ""Mystery,"" but it is plain that he was, at any rate,"

14352,PART I.,
14353,PART I.,_Anah_. But if our father see the sight!
14354,PART I.,
14355,PART I.,_Aho._ He would but deem it was the moon                           140
14356,PART I.,Rising unto some sorcerer's tune
14357,PART I.,An hour too soon.[141]

14363,PART I.,"My spirit, while they hover there,"
14364,PART I.,To Samiasa's breast!
14365,PART I.,
14366,PART I.,"_Anah_. Lo! they have kindled all the west,"
14367,PART I.,Like a returning sunset;--lo!
14368,PART I.,On Ararat's late secret crest
14369,PART I.,"A mild and many-coloured bow,                                      150"
14370,PART I.,"The remnant of their flashing path,"
14371,PART I.,"Now shines! and now, behold! it hath"
14372,PART I.,"Returned to night, as rippling foam,"
14373,PART I.,Which the Leviathan hath lashed
14374,PART I.,"From his unfathomable home,"
14375,PART I.,"When sporting on the face of the calm deep,"
14376,PART I.,Subsides soon after he again hath dashed

14387,PART I.,_Irad_. Despond not: wherefore wilt thou wander thus
14388,PART I.,"To add thy silence to the silent night,"
14389,PART I.,And lift thy tearful eye unto the stars?
14390,PART I.,They cannot aid thee.
14391,PART I.,
14392,PART I.,_Japh._               But they soothe me--now
14393,PART I.,Perhaps she looks upon them as I look.
14394,PART I.,Methinks a being that is beautiful
14395,PART I.,"Becometh more so as it looks on beauty,"
14396,PART I.,The eternal beauty of undying things.
14397,PART I.,"Oh, Anah!"
14398,PART I.,
14399,PART I.,_Irad_.    But she loves thee not.
14400,PART I.,
14401,PART I.,_Japh._                           Alas!
14402,PART I.,
14403,PART I.,_Irad_. And proud Aholibamah spurns me also.                        10
14404,PART I.,

14406,PART I.,
14407,PART I.,"_Irad_.                      Let her keep her pride,"
14408,PART I.,Mine hath enabled me to bear her scorn:
14409,PART I.,"It may be, time too will avenge it."
14410,PART I.,
14411,PART I.,_Japh._                            Canst thou
14412,PART I.,Find joy in such a thought?
14413,PART I.,
14414,PART I.,_Irad_.                     Nor joy nor sorrow.
14415,PART I.,"I loved her well; I would have loved her better,"
14416,PART I.,"Had love been met with love: as 'tis, I leave her"

14418,PART I.,
14419,PART I.,_Japh._ What destinies?
14420,PART I.,
14421,PART I.,_Irad_.                 I have some cause to think
14422,PART I.,She loves another.
14423,PART I.,
14424,PART I.,_Japh._             Anah!
14425,PART I.,
14426,PART I.,_Irad_.                  No; her sister.
14427,PART I.,
14428,PART I.,_Japh._ What other?
14429,PART I.,
14430,PART I.,"_Irad_.             That I know not; but her air,                   20"
14431,PART I.,"If not her words, tells me she loves another."
14432,PART I.,
14433,PART I.,"_Japh._ Aye, but not Anah: she but loves her God."
14434,PART I.,
14435,PART I.,"_Irad_. Whate'er she loveth, so she loves thee not,"

14437,PART I.,
14438,PART I.,"_Japh._                  True, nothing; but"
14439,PART I.,I love.
14440,PART I.,
14441,PART I.,_Irad_. And so did I.
14442,PART I.,
14443,PART I.,"_Japh._               And now thou lov'st not,"
14444,PART I.,"Or think'st thou lov'st not, art thou happier?"

14446,PART I.,_Irad_.                                       Yes.
14447,PART I.,
14448,PART I.,_Japh._ I pity thee.

14451,PART I.,
14452,PART I.,"_Japh._                      For being happy,"
14453,PART I.,Deprived of that which makes my misery.
14454,PART I.,
14455,PART I.,"_Irad_. I take thy taunt as part of thy distemper,"
14456,PART I.,And would not feel as thou dost for more shekels                    30
14457,PART I.,"Than all our father's herds would bring, if weighed"
14458,PART I.,Against the metal of the sons of Cain--[142]

14463,PART I.,"Our flocks and wilderness afford.--Go, Japhet,"
14464,PART I.,"Sigh to the stars, as wolves howl to the moon--"
14465,PART I.,I must back to my rest.
14466,PART I.,
14467,PART I.,_Japh._                  And so would I
14468,PART I.,If I could rest.
14469,PART I.,
14470,PART I.,_Irad_.          Thou wilt not to our tents then?                   40
14471,PART I.,
14472,PART I.,"_Japh._ No, Irad; I will to the cavern,[143] whose"
14473,PART I.,"Mouth they say opens from the internal world,"
14474,PART I.,To let the inner spirits of the earth
14475,PART I.,Forth when they walk its surface.
14476,PART I.,
14477,PART I.,_Irad_.                            Wherefore so?
14478,PART I.,What wouldst thou there?
14479,PART I.,
14480,PART I.,_Japh._                   Soothe further my sad spirit
14481,PART I.,"With gloom as sad: it is a hopeless spot,"
14482,PART I.,And I am hopeless.
14483,PART I.,
14484,PART I.,_Irad_.            But 'tis dangerous;
14485,PART I.,Strange sounds and sights have peopled it with terrors.
14486,PART I.,I must go with thee.
14487,PART I.,
14488,PART I.,"_Japh._               Irad, no; believe me"
14489,PART I.,"I feel no evil thought, and fear no evil.                           50"
14490,PART I.,
14491,PART I.,_Irad_. But evil things will be thy foe the more
14492,PART I.,"As not being of them: turn thy steps aside,"
14493,PART I.,Or let mine be with thine.
14494,PART I.,
14495,PART I.,"_Japh._                    No, neither, Irad;"
14496,PART I.,I must proceed alone.
14497,PART I.,
14498,PART I.,_Irad_.                Then peace be with thee!
14499,PART I.,[_Exit_ IRAD.

14502,PART I.,"Peace! I have sought it where it should be found,"
14503,PART I.,"In love--with love, too, which perhaps deserved it;"
14504,PART I.,"And, in its stead, a heaviness of heart,"
14505,PART I.,"A weakness of the spirit, listless days,"
14506,PART I.,And nights inexorable to sweet sleep
14507,PART I.,Have come upon me. Peace! what peace? the calm                      60
14508,PART I.,"Of desolation, and the stillness of"
14509,PART I.,"The untrodden forest, only broken by"
14510,PART I.,The sweeping tempest through its groaning boughs;
14511,PART I.,Such is the sullen or the fitful state
14512,PART I.,"Of my mind overworn. The Earth's grown wicked,"
14513,PART I.,And many signs and portents have proclaimed
14514,PART I.,"A change at hand, and an o'erwhelming doom"

14544,PART I.,_Noah_. What doth he there? It is an evil spot

14547,PART I.,"Still loves this daughter of a fated race,"

15255,PART I.,But ignorance must ever be
15256,PART I.,A part of sin;
15257,PART I.,And even the Spirits' knowledge shall grow less
15258,PART I.,As they wax proud within;                            540
15259,PART I.,For Blindness is the first-born of Excess.
15260,PART I.,"When all good angels left the world, ye stayed,"

15288,PART I.,Our brother Satan fell; his burning will

16050,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"mind that this unprinted first act of _Werner_, which synchronizes with"
16051,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"the _Siege of Corinth_ and _Parisina_, was written when Byron was a"
16052,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"member of the sub-committee of management of Drury Lane Theatre, and, as"
16053,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"the numerous stage directions testify, with a view to"
16054,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"stage-representation. The MS. is scored with corrections, and betrays an"
16055,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"unusual elaboration, and, perhaps, some difficulty and hesitation in the"
16056,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,choice of words and the construction of sentences. In the opening scene
16057,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"the situation is not caught and gripped, while the melancholy squalor of"

16077,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Byron's, and the ""conveyance"" of incidents occasional and insignificant."
16078,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Much, too, was imported into the play (_e.g._ almost the whole of the"

16092,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,The original story may be briefly retold. The prodigal and outlawed son
16093,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"of a Bohemian noble, Count Siegendorf, after various adventures,"
16094,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"marries, under the assumed name of Friedrich Kruitzner, the daughter of"
16095,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"an Italian scholar and man of science, of noble birth, but in narrow"
16096,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"circumstances. A son, Conrad, is born to him, who, at eight years of"
16097,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"age, is transferred to the charge of his grandfather. Twelve years go"
16098,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"by, and, when the fortunes of the younger Siegendorf are at their lowest"
16099,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"ebb, he learns, at the same moment, that his father is dead, and that a"
16100,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"distant kinsman, the Baron Stralenheim, is meditating an attack on his"
16101,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"person, with a view to claiming his inheritance. Of Conrad, who has"
16102,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"disappeared, he hears nothing."

16104,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,An accident compels the count and the baron to occupy adjoining quarters
16105,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"in a small town on the northern frontier of Silesia; and, again, another"
16106,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,accident places the usurping and intriguing baron at the mercy of his
16107,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,poverty-stricken and exiled kinsman. Stralenheim has fallen asleep near
16108,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,the fire in his easy-chair. Papers and several rouleaux of gold are
16109,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"ranged on a cabinet beside the bed. Kruitzner, who is armed with ""a"
16110,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"large and sharp knife,"" is suddenly confronted with his unarmed and"
16111,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"slumbering foe, and though habit and conscience conspire to make murder"
16112,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"impossible, he yields to a sudden and irresistible impulse, and snatches"
16113,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"up ""the portion of gold which is nearest."" He has no sooner returned to"
16114,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"his wife and confessed his deed, than Conrad suddenly appears on the"
16115,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"scene, and at the very moment of an unexpected and joyous reunion with"
16116,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"his parents, learns that his father is a thief. Kruitzner pleads ""guilty"
16117,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"with extenuating circumstances,"" and Conrad, who either is or pretends"
16118,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"to be disgusted at his father's sophistries, makes the best of a bad"
16119,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"business, and undertakes to conceal his father's dishonour and rescue"
16120,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,him from the power of Stralenheim. The plot hinges on the unlooked-for
16121,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"and unsuspected action of Conrad. Unlike his father, he is not the man"
16122,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"to let ""I dare not wait upon I would,"" but murders Stralenheim in cold"
16123,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"blood, and, at the same time, diverts suspicion from his father and"
16124,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"himself to the person of his comrade, a Hungarian soldier of fortune,"
16125,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"who is already supposed to be the thief, and who had sought and obtained"
16126,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,shelter in the apartments of the conscience-stricken Kruitzner.
16127,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16128,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"The scene changes to Prague. Siegendorf, no longer Kruitzner, has"
16129,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"regained his inheritance, and is once more at the height of splendour"
16130,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,and prosperity. A service of thanksgiving is being held in the cathedral
16131,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"to commemorate the signature of the Treaty of Prague (1635), and the"
16132,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"count is present in state. Suddenly he catches sight of the Hungarian,"
16133,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"and, ""like a flash of lightning"" feels and remembers that he _is_ a"
16134,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"thief, and that he might, however unjustly, be suspected if not accused"
16135,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"of the murder of Stralenheim. The service is over, and the count is"
16136,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"recrossing ""Muldau's Bridge,"" when he hears the fatal word _Kruitzner_,"
16137,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"""the seal of his shame,"" spoken in his ear. He returns to his castle,"
16138,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,and issues orders that the Hungarian should be arrested and
16139,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"interrogated. An interview takes place, at which the Hungarian denounces"
16140,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Conrad as the murderer of Stralenheim. The son acknowledges the deed,"
16141,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,and upbraids the father for his weakness and credulity in supposing that
16142,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,his escape from Stralenheim's machinations could have been effected by
16143,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"any other means. If, he argues, circumstances can palliate dishonesty,"
16144,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,they can compel and justify murder. Common sense even now demands the
16145,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"immediate slaughter of the Hungarian, as it compelled and sanctioned the"
16146,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"effectual silencing of Stralenheim. But Siegendorf knows not ""thorough,"""
16147,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"and shrinks at assassination. He repudiates and denounces his son, and"
16148,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"connives at the escape of the Hungarian. Conrad, who is banished from"
16149,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Prague, rejoins his former associates, the ""black bands,"" which were the"
16150,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"scandal and terror of the neighbouring provinces, and is killed in a"
16151,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,skirmish with the regular troops. Siegendorf dies of a broken heart.
16152,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16153,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"The conception of _The German's Tale_, as Byron perceived, is superior"
16154,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"to the execution. The style is laboured and involved, and the narrative"
16155,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"long-winded and tiresome. It is, perhaps, an adaptation, though not a"
16156,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"literal translation, of a German historical romance. But the _motif_--a"
16157,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"son predestined to evil by the weakness and sensuality of his father, a"
16158,INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,father punished for his want of rectitude by the passionate criminality

16182,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"to the effect that their grandmother, the duchess, ""wrote the poem and"

16186,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"in 1822 by his mother, Lady Granville, to her sister, Lady Carlisle,"
16187,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"which asserts that their mother, the duchess, ""wrote an entire tragedy"
16188,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"from Miss Lee's _Kreutzner the Hungarian_ (_sic_),"" and that the MS. had"
16189,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"been sent to her by Lady Caroline's brother, Mr. William Ponsonby, and"
16190,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"was in her possession; (3) another letter of Lady Granville's, dated"
16191,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"December 3, 1822, in which she informs her sister that her husband, Lord"
16192,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Granville, had promised to read _Werner_ aloud to her (i.e. Byron's"
16193,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"_Werner_, published November 23, 1822), a promise which, if fulfilled,"
16194,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,must have revealed one of two things--the existence of two dramas based
16195,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"on Miss Lee's _Kruitzner_, or the identity of Byron's version with that"
16196,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"of the duchess. Now, argues Mr. Leveson Gower, if Lady Granville had"
16197,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"known that two dramas were in existence, she would not have allowed her"
16198,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"daughter, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, to believe ""that the duchess was the"
16199,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"author of the published poem."""
16200,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16201,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,I will deal with the external evidence first. Practically it amounts to
16202,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"this: (1) that Lady Granville knew that her mother, the Duchess of"
16203,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Devonshire, dramatized Miss Lee's _Kruitzner_; and (2) that Lady"
16204,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,Georgiana Fullerton believed that the duchess gave the MS. of her play
16205,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"to Lady Caroline Ponsonby, and that, many years after, Lady Caroline"
16206,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,handed it over to Byron.
16207,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16208,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,The external evidence establishes the fact that the Duchess of
16209,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Devonshire dramatized _Kruitzner_, but it does not prove that Byron"
16210,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,purloined her adaptation. It records an unverified impression on the
16211,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"part of the duchess's granddaughter, that the MS. of a play written"
16212,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"between the years 1801-1806, passed into Byron's hands about the year"
16213,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,1813; that he took a copy of the MS.; and that in 1821-22 he caused his
16214,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,copy to be retranscribed and published under his own name.
16215,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16216,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"But Mr. Leveson Gower appeals to internal as well as external evidence,"
16217,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,(1) He regards the great inferiority of _Werner_ to Byron's published
16218,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"plays, and to the genuine (hitherto) unpublished first act, together"
16219,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"with the wholesale plagiarisms from Miss Lee's story, as an additional"
16220,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"proof that the work was none of his. (2) He notes, as a suspicious"
16221,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"circumstance, that ""while the rough copies of his other poems have been"
16222,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"preserved, no rough copy of _Werner_ is to be found."""
16223,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16224,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"In conclusion, he deals with two possible objections which may be"
16225,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,brought against his theory: (1) that Byron would not have incurred the
16226,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,risk of detection at the hands of the owners of the duchess's MS.; and
16227,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,(2) that a great poet of assured fame and reputation could have had no
16228,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,possible motive for perpetrating a literary fraud. The first objection
16229,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,he answers by assuming that Byron would have counted on the reluctance
16230,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"of the ""Ponsonby family and the daughters of the Duchess"" to rake up the"
16231,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"ashes of old scandals; the second, by pointing out that, in 1822, he was"
16232,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"making ""frantic endeavours to obtain money, not for himself, but to help"
16233,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"the cause of Greece."""
16234,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16235,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,(1) With regard to the marked inferiority of _Werner_ to Byron's other
16236,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"plays, and the relative proportion of adapted to original matter, Mr."
16237,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,Leveson Gower appears to have been misled by the disingenuous criticism
16238,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"of Maginn and other contemporary reviewers (_vide_ the Introduction,"
16239,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"etc., p. 326). There is no such inferiority, and the plagiarisms, which"
16240,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"were duly acknowledged, are confined to certain limited portions of the"
16241,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,play. (2) There is nothing unusual in the fact that the rough draft of
16242,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"_Werner_ cannot be found. In fact, but few of the early drafts of the"
16243,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,dramas and other poems written in the later Italian days ever reached
16244,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Murray's hands, or are still in existence. The fair copy for the printer"
16245,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"alone was sent home. The time had gone by when Byron's publisher, who"
16246,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"was also his friend, would stipulate that ""all the original MSS.,"
16247,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"copies and scraps"" should fall to his share. But no argument can be"
16248,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,founded on so insignificant a circumstance.
16249,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16250,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Finally, the argument on which Mr. Leveson Gower dwells at some length,"
16251,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"that Byron's ""motive"" for perpetrating a literary fraud was the"
16252,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"necessity for raising money for the cause of Greek independence, is"
16253,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"refuted by the fact that _Werner_ was begun in December, 1821, and"
16254,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"finished in January, 1822, and that it was not till the spring of 1823"
16255,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"that he was elected a member of the Greek Committee, or had any occasion"
16256,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,to raise funds for the maintenance of troops or the general expenses of
16257,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"the war. So far from attempting to raise money by _Werner_, in letters"
16258,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"to Murray, dated March 6, October 24, November 18, 1822, he emphatically"
16259,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"waives the question of ""terms,"" and makes no demand or request for money"
16260,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"whatever. It was not till December 23, 1823 (_Letters_, 1901, vi. 287),"
16261,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"two years after the play had been written, that he speaks of applying"
16262,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,the two or three hundred pounds which the copyright of _Werner_ might be
16263,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"worth, to the maintenance of armed men in the service of the"
16264,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"_Provisional Government_. He could not have ""purloined"" and palmed off"
16265,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,as his own the duchess's version of Miss Lee's story in order to raise
16266,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,money for a purpose which had not arisen. He had no intention at first
16267,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"or last of presenting the copyright of _Werner_ to Murray or Hunt, but"
16268,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"he was willing to wait for his money, and had no motive for raising"
16269,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,funds by an illegal and dishonourable trick.
16270,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16271,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"That Byron did _not_ write _Werner_ is, surely, non-proven on the"
16272,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,external and internal evidence adduced by Mr. Leveson Gower. On the
16273,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"other hand, there is abundant evidence, both external and internal,"

16291,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,
16292,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Again, in an unpublished diary of the same period it is recorded that"
16293,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Mrs. Shelley was engaged in the task of copying on January 17, 1822, and"
16294,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"the eight following days, and that on January 25 she finished her"

16297,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Again, Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824, p. 409) records the fact that"
16298,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Byron told him ""that he had almost finished another play ... called"

16300,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"and one entire act at a sitting."" It is almost incredible that Byron"
16301,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,should have recopied a copy of the duchess's play in order to impose on
16302,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,Mrs. Shelley and Williams and Medwin; and it is quite incredible that
16303,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"they were in the plot, and lent themselves to the deception. It is"
16304,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,certain that both Williams and Medwin believed that Byron was the author
16305,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"of _Werner_, and it is certain that nothing would have induced Mrs."
16306,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,Shelley to be _particeps criminis_--to copy a play which was not
16307,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,"Byron's, to be published as Byron's, and to suffer her copy to be"

16310,NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.,The internal evidence of the genuineness of _Werner_ is still more

16421,PREFACE,
16422,PREFACE,"The following drama is taken entirely from the _German's Tale,"
16423,PREFACE,"Kruitzner_, published many years ago in ""Lee's _Canterbury Tales_"""
16424,PREFACE,"written (I believe) by two sisters, of whom one furnished only this"
16425,PREFACE,"story and another, both of which are considered superior to the"
16426,PREFACE,"remainder of the collection.[159] I have adopted the characters, plan,"
16427,PREFACE,and even the language of many parts of this story. Some of the
16428,PREFACE,"characters are modified or altered, a few of the names changed, and one"
16429,PREFACE,character (Ida of Stralenheim) added by myself: but in the rest the
16430,PREFACE,"original is chiefly followed. When I was young (about fourteen, I"
16431,PREFACE,"think,) I first read this tale, which made a deep impression upon me;"
16432,PREFACE,"and may, indeed, be said to contain the germ of much that I have since"
16433,PREFACE,"written. I am not sure that it ever was very popular; or, at any rate,"
16434,PREFACE,its popularity has since been eclipsed by that of other great writers in
16435,PREFACE,the same department. But I have generally found that those who _had_
16436,PREFACE,"read it, agreed with me in their estimate of the singular power of mind"
16437,PREFACE,"and conception which it developes. I should also add _conception_,"
16438,PREFACE,"rather than execution; for the story might, perhaps, have been developed"
16439,PREFACE,with greater advantage. Amongst those whose opinions agreed with mine
16440,PREFACE,"upon this story, I could mention some very high names: but it is not"
16441,PREFACE,"necessary, nor indeed of any use; for every one must judge according to"
16442,PREFACE,"his own feelings. I merely refer the reader to the original story, that"
16443,PREFACE,he may see to what extent I have borrowed from it; and am not unwilling
16444,PREFACE,that he should find much greater pleasure in perusing it than the drama
16445,PREFACE,which is founded upon its contents.
16446,PREFACE,
16447,PREFACE,"I had begun a drama upon this tale so far back as 1815, (the first I"
16448,PREFACE,"ever attempted, except one at thirteen years old, called ""Ulric and"
16449,PREFACE,"Ilvina,"" which I had sense enough to burn,) and had nearly completed an"
16450,PREFACE,"act, when I was interrupted by circumstances. This is somewhere amongst"
16451,PREFACE,"my papers in England; but as it has not been found, I have re-written"
16452,PREFACE,"the first, and added the subsequent acts."

16612,ACT I.,_Jos._                  Lonely! my dear husband?
16613,ACT I.,
16614,ACT I.,"_Wer._ Or worse--involving all I love, in this"
16615,ACT I.,"Far worse than solitude. _Alone_, I had died,"
16616,ACT I.,And all been over in a nameless grave.
16617,ACT I.,
16618,ACT I.,_Jos._ And I had not outlived thee; but pray take

16628,ACT I.,_Jos._                  We are not baffled.
16629,ACT I.,

16631,ACT I.,
16632,ACT I.,_Jos._                       We ne'er were wealthy.
16633,ACT I.,

16680,ACT I.,_Jos._                           Alas!

16692,ACT I.,"Pondered not thus upon these worldly things,"
16693,ACT I.,My Werner! when you deigned to choose for bride

16695,ACT I.,
16696,ACT I.,"_Wer._ An exile's daughter with an outcast son,"

16698,ACT I.,To lift thee to the state we both were born for.
16699,ACT I.,"Your father's house was noble, though decayed;"

16701,ACT I.,
16702,ACT I.,"_Jos._ Your father did not think so, though 'twas noble;"

16704,ACT I.,"With thee, I should have deemed it what it is."
16705,ACT I.,

16713,ACT I.,_Jos._ Or worse; for it has been a canker in
16714,ACT I.,"Thy heart from the beginning: but for this,"
16715,ACT I.,We had not felt our poverty but as

16722,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_ironically_). And been an Hanseatic burgher? Excellent!

16733,ACT I.,Ne'er raised a thought to injure thee or thine.
16734,ACT I.,Thou didst not mar my fortunes: my own nature
16735,ACT I.,"In youth was such as to unmake an empire,"
16736,ACT I.,"Had such been my inheritance; but now,"
16737,ACT I.,"Chastened, subdued, out-worn, and taught to know"
16738,ACT I.,"Myself,--to lose this for our son and thee!"
16739,ACT I.,"Trust me, when, in my two-and-twentieth spring,"
16740,ACT I.,"My father barred me from my father's house,"

16751,ACT I.,
16752,ACT I.,_Wer._                                  A knocking!

16756,ACT I.,
16757,ACT I.,"_Wer._        And poverty hath none,"

16777,ACT I.,
16778,ACT I.,_Iden._                  Not afraid?
16779,ACT I.,Egad! I am afraid. You look as if

16782,ACT I.,
16783,ACT I.,"_Wer._                    Better, sir!"
16784,ACT I.,
16785,ACT I.,"_Iden._ Better or worse, like matrimony: what"
16786,ACT I.,Shall I say more? You have been a guest this month                 180
16787,ACT I.,"Here in the prince's palace--(to be sure,"
16788,ACT I.,His Highness had resigned it to the ghosts

16792,ACT I.,
16793,ACT I.,_Wer._                    My name is Werner[162].
16794,ACT I.,
16795,ACT I.,"_Iden._ A goodly name, a very worthy name,"
16796,ACT I.,As e'er was gilt upon a trader's board:
16797,ACT I.,I have a cousin in the lazaretto
16798,ACT I.,"Of Hamburgh, who has got a wife who bore"
16799,ACT I.,"The same. He is an officer of trust,                               190"
16800,ACT I.,"Surgeon's assistant (hoping to be surgeon),"
16801,ACT I.,And has done miracles i' the way of business.
16802,ACT I.,Perhaps you are related to my relative?

16804,ACT I.,_Wer._ To yours?
16805,ACT I.,
16806,ACT I.,"_Jos._           Oh, yes; we are, but distantly."
16807,ACT I.,(_Aside to_ WERNER.) Cannot you humour the dull gossip till
16808,ACT I.,We learn his purpose?
16809,ACT I.,
16810,ACT I.,"_Iden._               Well, I'm glad of that;"
16811,ACT I.,"I thought so all along, such natural yearnings"
16812,ACT I.,"Played round my heart:--blood is not water, cousin;"
16813,ACT I.,"And so let's have some wine, and drink unto"
16814,ACT I.,Our better acquaintance: relatives should be                       200
16815,ACT I.,Friends.
16816,ACT I.,
16817,ACT I.,_Wer._ You appear to have drunk enough already;
16818,ACT I.,"And if you have not, I've no wine to offer,"
16819,ACT I.,"Else it were yours: but this you know, or should know:"
16820,ACT I.,"You see I am poor, and sick, and will not see"

16822,ACT I.,What brings you here?

16824,ACT I.,"_Iden._              Why, what should bring me here?"

16835,ACT I.,_Iden._ The river has o'erflowed.
16836,ACT I.,
16837,ACT I.,_Jos._                            Alas! we have known              210

16839,ACT I.,It keeps us here.
16840,ACT I.,

16847,ACT I.,_Jos._ Poor creatures! are you sure?
16848,ACT I.,
16849,ACT I.,"_Iden._                              Yes, of the monkey,"
16850,ACT I.,"And the valet, and the cattle; but as yet"
16851,ACT I.,We know not if his Excellency's dead

16853,ACT I.,As it is fit that men in office should be;
16854,ACT I.,"But what is certain is, that he has swallowed"

16856,ACT I.,"And now a Saxon and Hungarian traveller,"

16861,ACT I.,
16862,ACT I.,"_Jos._ And where will you receive him? here, I hope,"
16863,ACT I.,If we can be of service--say the word.                             230
16864,ACT I.,
16865,ACT I.,"_Iden._ Here? no; but in the Prince's own apartment,"
16866,ACT I.,"As fits a noble guest:--'tis damp, no doubt,"
16867,ACT I.,Not having been inhabited these twelve years;
16868,ACT I.,"But then he comes from a much damper place,"

16872,ACT I.,I have ordered fire and all appliances
16873,ACT I.,"To be got ready for the worst--that is,"

16901,ACT I.,"_Gab._ Wetly and wearily, but out of peril:"
16902,ACT I.,He paused to change his garments in a cottage
16903,ACT I.,"(Where I doffed mine for these, and came on hither),"
16904,ACT I.,And has almost recovered from his drenching.

16945,ACT I.,"Good friend, and who may you be?"
16946,ACT I.,
16947,ACT I.,"_Gab._                          By my family,"
16948,ACT I.,Hungarian.
16949,ACT I.,
16950,ACT I.,_Iden._    Which is called?
16951,ACT I.,
16952,ACT I.,_Gab._                    It matters little.
16953,ACT I.,
16954,ACT I.,"_Iden._ (_aside_). I think that all the world are grown anonymous,"
16955,ACT I.,Since no one cares to tell me what he's called!
16956,ACT I.,"Pray, has his Excellency a large suite?"
16957,ACT I.,
16958,ACT I.,_Gab._                                  Sufficient.
16959,ACT I.,
16960,ACT I.,_Iden._ How many?
16961,ACT I.,
16962,ACT I.,_Gab._            I did not count them.
16963,ACT I.,"We came up by mere accident, and just"
16964,ACT I.,In time to drag him through his carriage window.
16965,ACT I.,
16966,ACT I.,"_Iden._ Well, what would I give to save a great man!               290"
16967,ACT I.,No doubt you'll have a swingeing sum as recompense.
16968,ACT I.,
16969,ACT I.,_Gab._ Perhaps.
16970,ACT I.,
16971,ACT I.,"_Iden._         Now, how much do you reckon on?"
16972,ACT I.,
16973,ACT I.,_Gab._ I have not yet put up myself to sale:
16974,ACT I.,"In the mean time, my best reward would be"
16975,ACT I.,"A glass of your[166] Hockcheimer--a _green_ glass,"
16976,ACT I.,"Wreathed with rich grapes and Bacchanal devices,"
16977,ACT I.,O'erflowing with the oldest of your vintage:
16978,ACT I.,"For which I promise you, in case you e'er"
16979,ACT I.,"Run hazard of being drowned, (although I own"
16980,ACT I.,"It seems, of all deaths, the least likely for you,)                300"
16981,ACT I.,"I'll pull you out for nothing. Quick, my friend,"
16982,ACT I.,"And think, for every bumper I shall quaff,"
16983,ACT I.,A wave the less may roll above your head.
16984,ACT I.,
16985,ACT I.,_Iden._ (_aside_). I don't much like this fellow--close and dry
16986,ACT I.,"He seems,--two things which suit me not; however,"
16987,ACT I.,"Wine he shall have; if that unlocks him not,"
16988,ACT I.,I shall not sleep to-night for curiosity.           [_Exit_ IDENSTEIN.
16989,ACT I.,
16990,ACT I.,_Gab._ (_to_ WERNER). This master of the ceremonies is
16991,ACT I.,"The intendant of the palace, I presume:"
16992,ACT I.,"'Tis a fine building, but decayed."
16993,ACT I.,
16994,ACT I.,_Wer._                             The apartment                   310
16995,ACT I.,Designed for him you rescued will be found
16996,ACT I.,In fitter order for a sickly guest.
16997,ACT I.,
16998,ACT I.,"_Gab._ I wonder then you occupied it not,"
16999,ACT I.,For you seem delicate in health.
17000,ACT I.,
17001,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_quickly_).              Sir!
17002,ACT I.,
17003,ACT I.,_Gab._                               Pray
17004,ACT I.,Excuse me: have I said aught to offend you?
17005,ACT I.,
17006,ACT I.,_Wer._ Nothing: but we are strangers to each other.
17007,ACT I.,
17008,ACT I.,_Gab._ And that's the reason I would have us less so:
17009,ACT I.,I thought our bustling guest without had said
17010,ACT I.,"You were a chance and passing guest, the counterpart"
17011,ACT I.,Of me and my companions.
17012,ACT I.,
17013,ACT I.,_Wer._                   Very true.                                320
17014,ACT I.,
17015,ACT I.,"_Gab._ Then, as we never met before, and never,"
17016,ACT I.,"It may be, may again encounter, why,"
17017,ACT I.,I thought to cheer up this old dungeon here
17018,ACT I.,(At least to me) by asking you to share
17019,ACT I.,The fare of my companions and myself.
17020,ACT I.,
17021,ACT I.,"_Wer._ Pray, pardon me; my health----"
17022,ACT I.,
17023,ACT I.,_Gab._                             Even as you please.
17024,ACT I.,"I have been a soldier, and perhaps am blunt"
17025,ACT I.,In bearing.
17026,ACT I.,
17027,ACT I.,"_Wer._      I have also served, and can"
17028,ACT I.,Requite a soldier's greeting.
17029,ACT I.,
17030,ACT I.,_Gab._                        In what service?
17031,ACT I.,The Imperial?
17032,ACT I.,
17033,ACT I.,"_Wer._ (_quickly, and then interrupting himself_)."
17034,ACT I.,I commanded--no--I mean                               330
17035,ACT I.,"I served; but it is many years ago,"
17036,ACT I.,When first Bohemia[167] raised her banner 'gainst
17037,ACT I.,The Austrian.
17038,ACT I.,
17039,ACT I.,"_Gab._        Well, that's over now, and peace"
17040,ACT I.,Has turned some thousand gallant hearts adrift
17041,ACT I.,"To live as they best may: and, to say truth,"
17042,ACT I.,Some take the shortest.
17043,ACT I.,
17044,ACT I.,_Wer._                  What is that?
17045,ACT I.,
17046,ACT I.,_Gab._                                Whate'er
17047,ACT I.,They lay their hands on. All Silesia and
17048,ACT I.,Lusatia's woods are tenanted by bands
17049,ACT I.,"Of the late troops, who levy on the country"
17050,ACT I.,Their maintenance: the Chatelains must keep                        340
17051,ACT I.,Their castle walls--beyond them 'tis but doubtful
17052,ACT I.,Travel for your rich Count or full-blown Baron.
17053,ACT I.,"My comfort is that, wander where I may,"
17054,ACT I.,I've little left to lose now.
17055,ACT I.,
17056,ACT I.,_Wer._                        And I--nothing.
17057,ACT I.,
17058,ACT I.,_Gab._ That's harder still. You say you were a soldier.
17059,ACT I.,
17060,ACT I.,_Wer._ I was.
17061,ACT I.,
17062,ACT I.,_Gab._        You look one still. All soldiers are
17063,ACT I.,"Or should be comrades, even though enemies."
17064,ACT I.,"Our swords when drawn must cross, our engines aim"
17065,ACT I.,(While levelled) at each other's hearts; but when
17066,ACT I.,"A truce, a peace, or what you will, remits                         350"
17067,ACT I.,"The steel into its scabbard, and lets sleep"
17068,ACT I.,"The spark which lights the matchlock, we are brethren."
17069,ACT I.,"You are poor and sickly--I am not rich, but healthy;"
17070,ACT I.,I want for nothing which I cannot want;
17071,ACT I.,You seem devoid of this--wilt share it?
17072,ACT I.,[GABOR _pulls out his purse_.
17073,ACT I.,
17074,ACT I.,_Wer._                                  Who
17075,ACT I.,Told you I was a beggar?
17076,ACT I.,
17077,ACT I.,"_Gab._                   You yourself,"
17078,ACT I.,In saying you were a soldier during peace-time.
17079,ACT I.,
17080,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_looking at him with suspicion_). You know me not.
17081,ACT I.,
17082,ACT I.,"_Gab._      I know no man, not even"
17083,ACT I.,Myself: how should I then know one I ne'er
17084,ACT I.,Beheld till half an hour since?
17085,ACT I.,
17086,ACT I.,"_Wer._                          Sir, I thank you.                  360"
17087,ACT I.,"Your offer's noble were it to a friend,"
17088,ACT I.,"And not unkind as to an unknown stranger,"
17089,ACT I.,Though scarcely prudent; but no less I thank you.
17090,ACT I.,I am a beggar in all save his trade;
17091,ACT I.,"And when I beg of any one, it shall be"
17092,ACT I.,Of him who was the first to offer what
17093,ACT I.,Few can obtain by asking. Pardon me.                   [_Exit_ WERNER.
17094,ACT I.,
17095,ACT I.,"_Gab._ (_solus_). A goodly fellow by his looks, though worn"
17096,ACT I.,"As most good fellows are, by pain or pleasure,"
17097,ACT I.,Which tear life out of us before our time;                         370
17098,ACT I.,I scarce know which most quickly: but he seems
17099,ACT I.,"To have seen better days, as who has not"
17100,ACT I.,Who has seen yesterday?--But here approaches
17101,ACT I.,"Our sage intendant, with the wine: however,"
17102,ACT I.,For the cup's sake I'll bear the cupbearer.
17103,ACT I.,
17104,ACT I.,_Enter_ IDENSTEIN.
17105,ACT I.,
17106,ACT I.,_Iden._ 'Tis here! the _supernaculum!_[168] twenty years
17107,ACT I.,"Of age, if 'tis a day."
17108,ACT I.,
17109,ACT I.,_Gab._                 Which epoch makes
17110,ACT I.,"Young women and old wine; and 'tis great pity,"
17111,ACT I.,"Of two such excellent things, increase of years,"
17112,ACT I.,"Which still improves the one, should spoil the other.              380"
17113,ACT I.,Fill full--Here's to our hostess!--your fair wife!
17114,ACT I.,[_Takes the glass_.
17115,ACT I.,
17116,ACT I.,"_Iden._ Fair!--Well, I trust your taste in wine is equal"
17117,ACT I.,To that you show for beauty; but I pledge you
17118,ACT I.,Nevertheless.
17119,ACT I.,
17120,ACT I.,_Gab._        Is not the lovely woman
17121,ACT I.,"I met in the adjacent hall, who, with"
17122,ACT I.,"An air, and port, and eye, which would have better"
17123,ACT I.,Beseemed this palace in its brightest days
17124,ACT I.,(Though in a garb adapted to its present
17125,ACT I.,"Abandonment), returned my salutation--"
17126,ACT I.,Is not the same your spouse?
17127,ACT I.,
17128,ACT I.,_Iden._                     I would she were!                      390
17129,ACT I.,But you're mistaken:--that's the stranger's wife.
17130,ACT I.,
17131,ACT I.,_Gab._ And by her aspect she might be a Prince's;
17132,ACT I.,"Though time hath touched her too, she still retains"
17133,ACT I.,"Much beauty, and more majesty."
17134,ACT I.,
17135,ACT I.,_Iden._                        And that
17136,ACT I.,"Is more than I can say for Madame Idenstein,"
17137,ACT I.,"At least in beauty: as for majesty,"
17138,ACT I.,She has some of its properties which might
17139,ACT I.,Be spared--but never mind!
17140,ACT I.,
17141,ACT I.,_Gab._                     I don't. But who
17142,ACT I.,May be this stranger? He too hath a bearing
17143,ACT I.,Above his outward fortunes.
17144,ACT I.,
17145,ACT I.,_Iden._                     There I differ.                        400
17146,ACT I.,"He's poor as Job, and not so patient; but"
17147,ACT I.,"Who he may be, or what, or aught of him,"
17148,ACT I.,Except his name (and that I only learned
17149,ACT I.,"To-night), I know not."
17150,ACT I.,
17151,ACT I.,_Gab._                 But how came he here?
17152,ACT I.,
17153,ACT I.,"_Iden._ In a most miserable old caleche,"
17154,ACT I.,"About a month since, and immediately"
17155,ACT I.,"Fell sick, almost to death. He should have died."
17156,ACT I.,
17157,ACT I.,_Gab._ Tender and true!--but why?
17158,ACT I.,
17159,ACT I.,"_Iden._                           Why, what is life"
17160,ACT I.,Without a living? He has not a stiver.[co]
17161,ACT I.,
17162,ACT I.,"_Gab._ In that case, I much wonder that a person                   410"
17163,ACT I.,Of your apparent prudence should admit
17164,ACT I.,Guests so forlorn into this noble mansion.
17165,ACT I.,
17166,ACT I.,"_Iden._ That's true: but pity, as you know, _does_ make"
17167,ACT I.,"One's heart commit these follies; and besides,"
17168,ACT I.,"They had some valuables left at that time,"
17169,ACT I.,Which paid their way up to the present hour;
17170,ACT I.,And so I thought they might as well be lodged
17171,ACT I.,"Here as at the small tavern, and I gave them"
17172,ACT I.,The run of some of the oldest palace rooms.
17173,ACT I.,"They served to air them, at the least as long                      420"
17174,ACT I.,As they could pay for firewood.
17175,ACT I.,
17176,ACT I.,_Gab._                          Poor souls!
17177,ACT I.,
17178,ACT I.,"_Iden._                                    Aye,"
17179,ACT I.,Exceeding poor.
17180,ACT I.,
17181,ACT I.,"_Gab._          And yet unused to poverty,"
17182,ACT I.,If I mistake not. Whither were they going?
17183,ACT I.,
17184,ACT I.,"_Iden._ Oh! Heaven knows where, unless to Heaven itself."
17185,ACT I.,Some days ago that looked the likeliest journey
17186,ACT I.,For Werner.
17187,ACT I.,
17188,ACT I.,_Gab._      Werner! I have heard the name.
17189,ACT I.,But it may be a feigned one.
17190,ACT I.,
17191,ACT I.,_Iden._                      Like enough!
17192,ACT I.,"But hark! a noise of wheels and voices, and"
17193,ACT I.,A blaze of torches from without. As sure
17194,ACT I.,"As destiny, his Excellency's come.                                 430"
17195,ACT I.,"I must be at my post; will you not join me,"
17196,ACT I.,"To help him from his carriage, and present"
17197,ACT I.,Your humble duty at the door?
17198,ACT I.,
17199,ACT I.,_Gab._                        I dragged him
17200,ACT I.,From out that carriage when he would have given
17201,ACT I.,His barony or county to repel
17202,ACT I.,The rushing river from his gurgling throat.
17203,ACT I.,"He has valets now enough: they stood aloof then,"
17204,ACT I.,"Shaking their dripping ears upon the shore,"
17205,ACT I.,"All roaring ""Help!"" but offering none; and as"
17206,ACT I.,"For _duty_ (as you call it)--I did mine _then_,                    440"
17207,ACT I.,"Now do _yours_. Hence, and bow and cringe him here!"
17208,ACT I.,
17209,ACT I.,_Iden._ _I_ cringe!--but I shall lose the opportunity--
17210,ACT I.,"Plague take it! he'll be _here_, and I _not there!_"
17211,ACT I.,[_Exit_ IDENSTEIN _hastily_.
17212,ACT I.,
17213,ACT I.,_Re-enter_ WERNER.
17214,ACT I.,
17215,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_to himself_). I heard a noise of wheels and voices. How
17216,ACT I.,All sounds now jar me!                            [_Perceiving_ GABOR.
17217,ACT I.,Still here! Is he not
17218,ACT I.,A spy of my pursuer's? His frank offer
17219,ACT I.,"So suddenly, and to a stranger, wore"
17220,ACT I.,The aspect of a secret enemy;
17221,ACT I.,For friends are slow at such.
17222,ACT I.,
17223,ACT I.,"_Gab._                       Sir, you seem rapt;"
17224,ACT I.,And yet the time is not akin to thought.                           450
17225,ACT I.,"These old walls will be noisy soon. The baron,"
17226,ACT I.,Or count (or whatsoe'er this half drowned noble
17227,ACT I.,"May be), for whom this desolate village and"
17228,ACT I.,Its lone inhabitants show more respect
17229,ACT I.,"Than did the elements, is come."
17230,ACT I.,
17231,ACT I.,_Iden._ (_without_).            This way--
17232,ACT I.,"This way, your Excellency:--have a care,"
17233,ACT I.,"The staircase is a little gloomy, and"
17234,ACT I.,Somewhat decayed; but if we had expected
17235,ACT I.,"So high a guest--Pray take my arm, my Lord!"
17236,ACT I.,
17237,ACT I.,"_Enter_ STRALENHEIM, IDENSTEIN, _and Attendants--partly"

17270,ACT I.,
17271,ACT I.,"_Iden._ He!--no, my Lord! he rather wants for rescue"

17275,ACT I.,
17276,ACT I.,_Stral._                              Methought

17278,ACT I.,
17279,ACT I.,"_Gab._               There were, in company;"
17280,ACT I.,"But, in the service rendered to your Lordship,"
17281,ACT I.,"I needs must say but _one_, and he is absent."
17282,ACT I.,The chief part of whatever aid was rendered
17283,ACT I.,Was _his_: it was his fortune to be first.                         480
17284,ACT I.,"My will was not inferior, but his strength"
17285,ACT I.,And youth outstripped me; therefore do not waste
17286,ACT I.,Your thanks on me. I was but a glad second
17287,ACT I.,Unto a nobler principal.
17288,ACT I.,
17289,ACT I.,_Stral._                 Where is he?
17290,ACT I.,
17291,ACT I.,"_An Atten._ My Lord, he tarried in the cottage where"
17292,ACT I.,"Your Excellency rested for an hour,"
17293,ACT I.,And said he would be here to-morrow.
17294,ACT I.,
17295,ACT I.,_Stral._                             Till
17296,ACT I.,"That hour arrives, I can but offer thanks,"
17297,ACT I.,And then----
17298,ACT I.,
17299,ACT I.,"_Gab._      I seek no more, and scarce deserve"
17300,ACT I.,So much. My comrade may speak for himself.                         490
17301,ACT I.,
17302,ACT I.,_Stral._ (_fixing his eyes upon_ WERNER: _then aside_).
17303,ACT I.,It cannot be! and yet he must be looked to.
17304,ACT I.,'Tis twenty years since I beheld him with
17305,ACT I.,"These eyes; and, though my agents still have kept"
17306,ACT I.,"_Theirs_ on him, policy has held aloof"
17307,ACT I.,"My own from his, not to alarm him into"
17308,ACT I.,Suspicion of my plan. Why did I leave
17309,ACT I.,At Hamburgh those who would have made assurance
17310,ACT I.,"If this be he or no? I thought, ere now,"
17311,ACT I.,"To have been lord of Siegendorf, and parted"
17312,ACT I.,"In haste, though even the elements appear                          500"
17313,ACT I.,"To fight against me, and this sudden flood"
17314,ACT I.,May keep me prisoner here till----
17315,ACT I.,[_He pauses and looks at_ WERNER: _then resumes_.
17316,ACT I.,This man must
17317,ACT I.,"Be watched. If it is he, he is so changed,"
17318,ACT I.,"His father, rising from his grave again,"
17319,ACT I.,Would pass by him unknown. I must be wary:
17320,ACT I.,An error would spoil all.
17321,ACT I.,
17322,ACT I.,_Iden._                   Your Lordship seems
17323,ACT I.,Pensive. Will it not please you to pass on?
17324,ACT I.,
17325,ACT I.,"_Stral._ 'Tis past fatigue, which gives my weighed-down spirit"
17326,ACT I.,An outward show of thought. I will to rest.
17327,ACT I.,
17328,ACT I.,"_Iden._ The Prince's chamber is prepared, with all                 510"
17329,ACT I.,The very furniture the Prince used when
17330,ACT I.,"Last here, in its full splendour."
17331,ACT I.,"(_Aside_). Somewhat tattered,"
17332,ACT I.,"And devilish damp, but fine enough by torch-light;"
17333,ACT I.,And that's enough for your right noble blood
17334,ACT I.,Of twenty quarterings upon a hatchment;
17335,ACT I.,So let their bearer sleep 'neath something like one
17336,ACT I.,"Now, as he one day will for ever lie."
17337,ACT I.,
17338,ACT I.,_Stral._ (_rising and turning to_ GABOR).
17339,ACT I.,"Good night, good people! Sir, I trust to-morrow"
17340,ACT I.,Will find me apter to requite your service.
17341,ACT I.,In the meantime I crave your company                               520
17342,ACT I.,A moment in my chamber.
17343,ACT I.,
17344,ACT I.,_Gab._                  I attend you.
17345,ACT I.,
17346,ACT I.,"_Stral_, (_after a few steps, pauses, and calls_ WERNER)."
17347,ACT I.,Friend!
17348,ACT I.,
17349,ACT I.,_Wer._ Sir!
17350,ACT I.,
17351,ACT I.,_Iden._ _Sir!_ Lord--oh Lord! Why don't you say
17352,ACT I.,"His Lordship, or his Excellency? Pray,"
17353,ACT I.,"My Lord, excuse this poor man's want of breeding:"
17354,ACT I.,He hath not been accustomed to admission
17355,ACT I.,To such a presence.
17356,ACT I.,
17357,ACT I.,"_Stral._ (_to_ IDENSTEIN). Peace, intendant!"
17358,ACT I.,
17359,ACT I.,_Iden._                                           Oh!
17360,ACT I.,I am dumb.
17361,ACT I.,
17362,ACT I.,_Stral._ (_to_ WERNER). Have you been long here?
17363,ACT I.,
17364,ACT I.,_Wer._                                          Long?
17365,ACT I.,
17366,ACT I.,_Stral._                                             I sought
17367,ACT I.,"An answer, not an echo."
17368,ACT I.,
17369,ACT I.,_Wer._                  You may seek
17370,ACT I.,Both from the walls. I am not used to answer
17371,ACT I.,Those whom I know not.
17372,ACT I.,
17373,ACT I.,"_Stral._                Indeed! Ne'er the less,                    530"
17374,ACT I.,You might reply with courtesy to what
17375,ACT I.,Is asked in kindness.
17376,ACT I.,
17377,ACT I.,_Wer._                When I know it such
17378,ACT I.,"I will requite--that is, _reply_--in unison."
17379,ACT I.,
17380,ACT I.,"_Stral._ The intendant said, you had been detained by sickness--"
17381,ACT I.,If I could aid you--journeying the same way?
17382,ACT I.,
17383,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_quickly_). I am not journeying the same way!
17384,ACT I.,
17385,ACT I.,_Stral._                                             How know ye
17386,ACT I.,"That, ere you know my route?"
17387,ACT I.,
17388,ACT I.,_Wer._                      Because there is
17389,ACT I.,But one way that the rich and poor must tread
17390,ACT I.,Together. You diverged from that dread path
17391,ACT I.,"Some hours ago, and I some days: henceforth                        540"
17392,ACT I.,"Our roads must lie asunder, though they tend"
17393,ACT I.,All to one home.
17394,ACT I.,
17395,ACT I.,_Stral._         Your language is above
17396,ACT I.,Your station.
17397,ACT I.,
17398,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_bitterly_). Is it?
17399,ACT I.,
17400,ACT I.,"_Stral._                    Or, at least, beyond"
17401,ACT I.,Your garb.
17402,ACT I.,
17403,ACT I.,"_Wer._ 'Tis well that it is not beneath it,"
17404,ACT I.,As sometimes happens to the better clad.
17405,ACT I.,"But, in a word, what would you with me?"
17406,ACT I.,
17407,ACT I.,_Stral._ (_startled_).                  I?
17408,ACT I.,
17409,ACT I.,"_Wer._ Yes--you! You know me not, and question me,"
17410,ACT I.,And wonder that I answer not--not knowing
17411,ACT I.,"My inquisitor. Explain what you would have,"
17412,ACT I.,"And then I'll satisfy yourself, or me.                             550"
17413,ACT I.,
17414,ACT I.,_Stral._ I knew not that you had reasons for reserve.
17415,ACT I.,
17416,ACT I.,_Wer._ Many have such:--Have you none?
17417,ACT I.,
17418,ACT I.,_Stral._                               None which can
17419,ACT I.,Interest a mere stranger.
17420,ACT I.,
17421,ACT I.,_Wer._                    Then forgive
17422,ACT I.,"The same unknown and humble stranger, if"
17423,ACT I.,He wishes to remain so to the man
17424,ACT I.,Who can have nought in common with him.
17425,ACT I.,
17426,ACT I.,"_Stral._                                Sir,"
17427,ACT I.,"I will not balk your humour, though untoward:"
17428,ACT I.,I only meant you service--but good night!
17429,ACT I.,"Intendant, show the way! (_To_ GABOR.) Sir, you will with me?"
17430,ACT I.,[_Exeunt_ STRALENHEIM _and Attendants_; IDENSTEIN _and_ GABOR.
17431,ACT I.,
17432,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_solus_). 'Tis he! I am taken in the toils. Before         560
17433,ACT I.,"I quitted Hamburg, Giulio, his late steward,"
17434,ACT I.,"Informed me, that he had obtained an order"
17435,ACT I.,"From Brandenburg's elector, for the arrest"
17436,ACT I.,Of Kruitzner (such the name I then bore) when
17437,ACT I.,I came upon the frontier; the free city
17438,ACT I.,Alone preserved my freedom--till I left
17439,ACT I.,Its walls--fool that I was to quit them! But
17440,ACT I.,"I deemed this humble garb, and route obscure,"
17441,ACT I.,Had baffled the slow hounds in their pursuit.
17442,ACT I.,What's to be done? He knows me not by person;                      570
17443,ACT I.,"Nor could aught, save the eye of apprehension,"
17444,ACT I.,"Have recognised _him_, after twenty years--"
17445,ACT I.,We met so rarely and so coldly in
17446,ACT I.,Our youth. But those about him! Now I can
17447,ACT I.,"Divine the frankness of the Hungarian, who"
17448,ACT I.,"No doubt is a mere tool and spy of Stralenheim's,"
17449,ACT I.,To sound and to secure me. Without means!
17450,ACT I.,"Sick, poor--begirt too with the flooding rivers,"
17451,ACT I.,"Impassable even to the wealthy, with"
17452,ACT I.,All the appliances which purchase modes                            580
17453,ACT I.,"Of overpowering peril, with men's lives,--"
17454,ACT I.,How can I hope! An hour ago methought
17455,ACT I.,"My state beyond despair; and now, 'tis such,"
17456,ACT I.,"The past seems paradise. Another day,"
17457,ACT I.,"And I'm detected,--on the very eve"
17458,ACT I.,"Of honours, rights, and my inheritance,"
17459,ACT I.,When a few drops of gold might save me still
17460,ACT I.,In favouring an escape.
17461,ACT I.,
17462,ACT I.,_Enter_ IDENSTEIN _and_ FRITZ _in conversation_.
17463,ACT I.,
17464,ACT I.,_Fritz_.                Immediately.
17465,ACT I.,
17466,ACT I.,"_Iden._ I tell you, 'tis impossible."
17467,ACT I.,
17468,ACT I.,_Fritz_.                             It must
17469,ACT I.,"Be tried, however; and if one express                              590"
17470,ACT I.,"Fail, you must send on others, till the answer"
17471,ACT I.,"Arrives from Frankfort, from the commandant."
17472,ACT I.,
17473,ACT I.,_Iden._ I will do what I can.
17474,ACT I.,
17475,ACT I.,_Fritz_.                      And recollect
17476,ACT I.,To spare no trouble; you will be repaid
17477,ACT I.,Tenfold.
17478,ACT I.,
17479,ACT I.,_Iden._ The Baron is retired to rest?
17480,ACT I.,
17481,ACT I.,_Fritz_. He hath thrown himself into an easy chair
17482,ACT I.,"Beside the fire, and slumbers; and has ordered"
17483,ACT I.,"He may not be disturbed until eleven,"
17484,ACT I.,When he will take himself to bed.
17485,ACT I.,
17486,ACT I.,_Iden._                           Before
17487,ACT I.,An hour is past I'll do my best to serve him.                      600
17488,ACT I.,
17489,ACT I.,_Fritz_. Remember!                                      [_Exit_ FRITZ.
17490,ACT I.,
17491,ACT I.,_Iden._            The devil take these great men! they
17492,ACT I.,Think all things made for them. Now here must I
17493,ACT I.,Rouse up some half a dozen shivering vassals
17494,ACT I.,"From their scant pallets, and, at peril of"
17495,ACT I.,"Their lives, despatch them o'er the river towards"
17496,ACT I.,Frankfort. Methinks the Baron's own experience
17497,ACT I.,Some hours ago might teach him fellow-feeling:
17498,ACT I.,"But no, ""it _must_"" and there's an end. How now?"
17499,ACT I.,"Are you there, Mynheer Werner?"
17500,ACT I.,
17501,ACT I.,_Wer._                         You have left
17502,ACT I.,Your noble guest right quickly.
17503,ACT I.,
17504,ACT I.,"_Iden._                         Yes--he's dozing,                  610"
17505,ACT I.,And seems to like that none should sleep besides.
17506,ACT I.,Here is a packet for the Commandant
17507,ACT I.,"Of Frankfort, at all risks and all expenses;"
17508,ACT I.,But I must not lose time: Good night!                    [_Exit_ IDEN.
17509,ACT I.,
17510,ACT I.,"_Wer._                               ""To Frankfort!"""
17511,ACT I.,"So, so, it thickens! Aye, ""the Commandant!"""
17512,ACT I.,This tallies well with all the prior steps
17513,ACT I.,"Of this cool, calculating fiend, who walks"
17514,ACT I.,Between me and my father's house. No doubt
17515,ACT I.,He writes for a detachment to convey me
17516,ACT I.,Into some secret fortress.--Sooner than                            620
17517,ACT I.,This----
17518,ACT I.,"[WERNER _looks around, and snatches up a knife lying"
17519,ACT I.,on a table in a recess_.
17520,ACT I.,Now I am master of myself at least.
17521,ACT I.,"Hark,--footsteps! How do I know that Stralenheim"
17522,ACT I.,Will wait for even the show of that authority
17523,ACT I.,Which is to overshadow usurpation?
17524,ACT I.,That he suspects me 's certain. I'm alone--
17525,ACT I.,He with a numerous train: I weak--he strong
17526,ACT I.,"In gold, in numbers, rank, authority."
17527,ACT I.,"I nameless, or involving in my name"
17528,ACT I.,"Destruction, till I reach my own domain;"
17529,ACT I.,"He full-blown with his titles, which impose                        630"
17530,ACT I.,Still further on these obscure petty burghers
17531,ACT I.,Than they could do elsewhere. Hark! nearer still!
17532,ACT I.,"I'll to the secret passage, which communicates"
17533,ACT I.,With the----No! all is silent--'twas my fancy!--
17534,ACT I.,Still as the breathless interval between
17535,ACT I.,The flash and thunder:--I must hush my soul
17536,ACT I.,"Amidst its perils. Yet I will retire,"
17537,ACT I.,To see if still be unexplored the passage
17538,ACT I.,I wot of: it will serve me as a den
17539,ACT I.,"Of secrecy for some hours, at the worst.                           640"
17540,ACT I.,"[WERNER _draws a panel, and exit, closing it after him_."
17541,ACT I.,
17542,ACT I.,_Enter_ GABOR _and_ JOSEPHINE.
17543,ACT I.,
17544,ACT I.,_Gab._ Where is your husband?
17545,ACT I.,
17546,ACT I.,"_Jos._                        _Here_, I thought: I left him"
17547,ACT I.,Not long since in his chamber. But these rooms
17548,ACT I.,"Have many outlets, and he may be gone"
17549,ACT I.,To accompany the Intendant.
17550,ACT I.,
17551,ACT I.,_Gab._                      Baron Stralenheim
17552,ACT I.,Put many questions to the Intendant on
17553,ACT I.,"The subject of your lord, and, to be plain,"
17554,ACT I.,I have my doubts if he means well.
17555,ACT I.,
17556,ACT I.,_Jos._                             Alas!
17557,ACT I.,What can there be in common with the proud
17558,ACT I.,"And wealthy Baron, and the unknown Werner?"
17559,ACT I.,
17560,ACT I.,_Gab._ That you know best.
17561,ACT I.,
17562,ACT I.,"_Jos._                     Or, if it were so, how                  650"
17563,ACT I.,"Come you to stir yourself in his behalf,"
17564,ACT I.,Rather than that of him whose life you saved?
17565,ACT I.,
17566,ACT I.,"_Gab._ I helped to save him, as in peril; but"
17567,ACT I.,I did not pledge myself to serve him in
17568,ACT I.,"Oppression. I know well these nobles, and"
17569,ACT I.,Their thousand modes of trampling on the poor.
17570,ACT I.,I have proved them; and my spirit boils up when
17571,ACT I.,I find them practising against the weak:--
17572,ACT I.,This is my only motive.
17573,ACT I.,
17574,ACT I.,_Jos._                  It would be
17575,ACT I.,Not easy to persuade my consort of                                 660
17576,ACT I.,Your good intentions.
17577,ACT I.,
17578,ACT I.,_Gab._                Is he so suspicious?
17579,ACT I.,
17580,ACT I.,_Jos._ He was not once; but time and troubles have
17581,ACT I.,Made him what you beheld.
17582,ACT I.,
17583,ACT I.,_Gab._                    I'm sorry for it.
17584,ACT I.,"Suspicion is a heavy armour, and"
17585,ACT I.,With its own weight impedes more than protects.
17586,ACT I.,Good night! I trust to meet with him at day-break.
17587,ACT I.,[_Exit_ GABOR.

17589,ACT I.,_Re-enter_ IDENSTEIN _and some Peasants_.
17590,ACT I.,JOSEPHINE _retires up the Hall_.
17591,ACT I.,
17592,ACT I.,_First Peasant_. But if I'm drowned?
17593,ACT I.,
17594,ACT I.,"_Iden._                      Why, you will be well paid for 't,"
17595,ACT I.,"And have risked more than drowning for as much,"
17596,ACT I.,I doubt not.
17597,ACT I.,
17598,ACT I.,_Second Peasant_. But our wives and families?
17599,ACT I.,
17600,ACT I.,"_Iden._ Cannot be worse off than they are, and may                 670"
17601,ACT I.,Be better.
17602,ACT I.,
17603,ACT I.,"_Third Peasant_. I have neither, and will venture."
17604,ACT I.,
17605,ACT I.,"_Iden._ That's right. A gallant carle, and fit to be"
17606,ACT I.,A soldier. I'll promote you to the ranks
17607,ACT I.,In the Prince's body-guard--if you succeed:
17608,ACT I.,"And you shall have besides, in sparkling coin,"
17609,ACT I.,Two thalers.
17610,ACT I.,
17611,ACT I.,_Third Peasant_. No more!
17612,ACT I.,
17613,ACT I.,_Iden._                   Out upon your avarice!
17614,ACT I.,Can that low vice alloy so much ambition?
17615,ACT I.,"I tell thee, fellow, that two thalers in"
17616,ACT I.,Small change will subdivide into a treasure.
17617,ACT I.,Do not five hundred thousand heroes daily                          680
17618,ACT I.,Risk lives and souls for the tithe of one thaler?
17619,ACT I.,When had you half the sum?

17624,ACT I.,_Iden._                     Have you forgot
17625,ACT I.,"Whose vassal you were born, knave?"
17626,ACT I.,
17627,ACT I.,"_Third Peasant_.                   No--the Prince's,"

17629,ACT I.,
17630,ACT I.,_Iden._                 Sirrah! in the Prince's
17631,ACT I.,"Absence, I am sovereign; and the Baron is"
17632,ACT I.,"My intimate connection;--""Cousin Idenstein!"
17633,ACT I.,"(Quoth he) you'll order out a dozen villains."""
17634,ACT I.,"And so, you villains! troop--march--march, I say;"

17637,ACT I.,"For every page of paper, shall a hide"

17639,ACT I.,"Like Ziska's skin,[169] to beat alarm to all"

17651,ACT I.,O'er something poorer still--the pride of rank
17652,ACT I.,"In servitude, o'er something still more servile;"
17653,ACT I.,And vice in misery affecting still
17654,ACT I.,A tattered splendour. What a state of being!
17655,ACT I.,"In Tuscany, my own dear sunny land,"
17656,ACT I.,"Our nobles were but citizens and merchants,[170]"
17657,ACT I.,"Like Cosmo. We had evils, but not such"
17658,ACT I.,As these; and our all-ripe and gushing valleys                     710
17659,ACT I.,"Made poverty more cheerful, where each herb"
17660,ACT I.,"Was in itself a meal, and every vine"
17661,ACT I.,"Rained, as it were, the beverage which makes glad"
17662,ACT I.,The heart of man; and the ne'er unfelt sun
17663,ACT I.,"(But rarely clouded, and when clouded, leaving"
17664,ACT I.,His warmth behind in memory of his beams)
17665,ACT I.,"Makes the worn mantle, and the thin robe, less"

17667,ACT I.,"But, here! the despots of the north appear"

17669,ACT I.,"Searching the shivering vassal through his rags,"
17670,ACT I.,To wring his soul--as the bleak elements
17671,ACT I.,His form. And 'tis to be amongst these sovereigns
17672,ACT I.,My husband pants! and such his pride of birth--
17673,ACT I.,"That twenty years of usage, such as no"

17675,ACT I.,"His soul to persecute a son withal,"

17677,ACT I.,"But I, born nobly also, from my father's"

17686,ACT I.,
17687,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_not at first recognising her_).
17688,ACT I.,Discovered! then I'll stab--(_recognising her_). Ah! Josephine
17689,ACT I.,Why art thou not at rest?
17690,ACT I.,
17691,ACT I.,_Jos._                    What rest? My God!
17692,ACT I.,What doth this mean?
17693,ACT I.,
17694,ACT I.,_Wer._ (_showing a rouleau_).
17695,ACT I.,"Here's _gold_--_gold_, Josephine,"
17696,ACT I.,Will rescue us from this detested dungeon.
17697,ACT I.,
17698,ACT I.,_Jos._ And how obtained?--that knife!
17699,ACT I.,
17700,ACT I.,_Wer._                              'Tis bloodless--_yet_.

17702,ACT I.,
17703,ACT I.,_Jos._                         But whence comest thou?             740
17704,ACT I.,
17705,ACT I.,_Wer._ Ask not! but let us think where we shall go--
17706,ACT I.,This--this will make us way--(_showing the gold_)--I'll fit them now.
17707,ACT I.,
17708,ACT I.,_Jos._ I dare not think thee guilty of dishonour.
17709,ACT I.,
17710,ACT I.,_Wer._ Dishonour!
17711,ACT I.,
17712,ACT I.,_Jos._            I have said it.
17713,ACT I.,
17714,ACT I.,_Wer._                           Let us hence:
17715,ACT I.,"'Tis the last night, I trust, that we need pass here."
17716,ACT I.,
17717,ACT I.,"_Jos._ And not the worst, I hope."
17718,ACT I.,
17719,ACT I.,_Wer._                            Hope! I make _sure_.
17720,ACT I.,But let us to our chamber.
17721,ACT I.,
17722,ACT I.,_Jos._                     Yet one question--
17723,ACT I.,What hast thou _done_?
17724,ACT I.,
17725,ACT I.,"_Wer._ (_fiercely_). Left one thing _undone_, which"
17726,ACT I.,Had made all well: let me not think of it!
17727,ACT I.,Away!
17728,ACT I.,
17729,ACT I.,_Jos._ Alas that I should doubt of thee!                           750

17736,ACT II.,
17737,ACT II.,SCENE I.--_A Hall in the same Palace_.
17738,ACT II.,
17739,ACT II.,_Enter_ IDENSTEIN _and Others_.
17740,ACT II.,
17741,ACT II.,_Iden._ Fine doings! goodly doings! honest doings!
17742,ACT II.,A Baron pillaged in a Prince's palace!
17743,ACT II.,"Where, till this hour, such a sin ne'er was heard of."
17744,ACT II.,
17745,ACT II.,"_Fritz_. It hardly could, unless the rats despoiled"
17746,ACT II.,The mice of a few shreds of tapestry.
17747,ACT II.,
17748,ACT II.,_Iden._ Oh! that I e'er should live to see this day!
17749,ACT II.,The honour of our city's gone for ever.
17750,ACT II.,
17751,ACT II.,"_Fritz_. Well, but now to discover the delinquent:"
17752,ACT II.,The Baron is determined not to lose
17753,ACT II.,This sum without a search.
17754,ACT II.,
17755,ACT II.,_Iden._                    And so am I.                             10
17756,ACT II.,
17757,ACT II.,_Fritz_. But whom do you suspect?
17758,ACT II.,
17759,ACT II.,_Iden._                           Suspect! all people
17760,ACT II.,Without--within--above--below--Heaven help me!
17761,ACT II.,
17762,ACT II.,_Fritz_. Is there no other entrance to the chamber?
17763,ACT II.,
17764,ACT II.,_Iden._   None whatsoever.
17765,ACT II.,
17766,ACT II.,_Fritz_.                  Are you sure of that?
17767,ACT II.,
17768,ACT II.,"_Iden._ Certain. I have lived and served here since my birth,"
17769,ACT II.,"And if there were such, must have heard of such,"
17770,ACT II.,Or seen it.
17771,ACT II.,
17772,ACT II.,_Fritz_.   Then it must be some one who
17773,ACT II.,Had access to the antechamber.
17774,ACT II.,
17775,ACT II.,_Iden._                        Doubtless.
17776,ACT II.,
17777,ACT II.,_Fritz_. The man called _Werner's_ poor!
17778,ACT II.,
17779,ACT II.,_Iden._                                 Poor as a miser[171].
17780,ACT II.,"But lodged so far off, in the other wing,                           20"
17781,ACT II.,By which there's no communication with
17782,ACT II.,"The baron's chamber, that it can't be he."
17783,ACT II.,"Besides, I bade him ""good night"" in the hall,"
17784,ACT II.,"Almost a mile off, and which only leads"
17785,ACT II.,"To his own apartment, about the same time"
17786,ACT II.,"When this burglarious, larcenous felony"
17787,ACT II.,Appears to have been committed.
17788,ACT II.,
17789,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                        There's another,"
17790,ACT II.,The stranger----
17791,ACT II.,
17792,ACT II.,_Iden._          The Hungarian?
17793,ACT II.,
17794,ACT II.,_Fritz_.                      He who helped
17795,ACT II.,To fish the baron from the Oder.
17796,ACT II.,
17797,ACT II.,_Iden._                          Not
17798,ACT II.,"Unlikely. But, hold--might it not have been                         30"
17799,ACT II.,One of the suite?
17800,ACT II.,
17801,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.          How? _We_, sir!"
17802,ACT II.,
17803,ACT II.,"_Iden._                          No--not _you_,"
17804,ACT II.,But some of the inferior knaves. You say
17805,ACT II.,The Baron was asleep in the great chair--
17806,ACT II.,The velvet chair--in his embroidered night-gown;
17807,ACT II.,"His toilet spread before him, and upon it"
17808,ACT II.,"A cabinet with letters, papers, and"
17809,ACT II.,Several rouleaux of gold; of which _one_ only
17810,ACT II.,"Has disappeared:--the door unbolted, with"
17811,ACT II.,No difficult access to any.
17812,ACT II.,
17813,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                    Good sir,"
17814,ACT II.,Be not so quick; the honour of the corps                            40
17815,ACT II.,Which forms the Baron's household's unimpeached
17816,ACT II.,"From steward to scullion, save in the fair way"
17817,ACT II.,"Of peculation; such as in accompts,"
17818,ACT II.,"Weights, measures, larder, cellar, buttery,"
17819,ACT II.,Where all men take their prey; as also in
17820,ACT II.,"Postage of letters, gathering of rents,"
17821,ACT II.,"Purveying feasts, and understanding with"
17822,ACT II.,The honest trades who furnish noble masters[cq];
17823,ACT II.,"But for your petty, picking, downright thievery,"
17824,ACT II.,We scorn it as we do board wages. Then                              50
17825,ACT II.,"Had one of our folks done it, he would not"
17826,ACT II.,Have been so poor a spirit as to hazard
17827,ACT II.,"His neck for _one_ rouleau, but have swooped all;"
17828,ACT II.,"Also the cabinet, if portable."
17829,ACT II.,
17830,ACT II.,_Iden._ There is some sense in that----
17831,ACT II.,
17832,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                                No, Sir, be sure"
17833,ACT II.,"'Twas none of our corps; but some petty, trivial"
17834,ACT II.,"Picker and stealer, without art or genius."
17835,ACT II.,The only question is--Who else could have
17836,ACT II.,"Access, save the Hungarian and yourself?"
17837,ACT II.,
17838,ACT II.,_Iden._ You don't mean me?
17839,ACT II.,
17840,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                   No, sir; I honour more                   60"
17841,ACT II.,Your talents----
17842,ACT II.,
17843,ACT II.,"_Iden._          And my principles, I hope."
17844,ACT II.,
17845,ACT II.,_Fritz_. Of course. But to the point: What's to be done?
17846,ACT II.,
17847,ACT II.,_Iden._ Nothing--but there's a good deal to be said.
17848,ACT II.,"We'll offer a reward; move heaven and earth,"
17849,ACT II.,And the police (though there's none nearer than
17850,ACT II.,Frankfort); post notices in manuscript
17851,ACT II.,(For we've no printer); and set by my clerk
17852,ACT II.,"To read them (for few can, save he and I)."
17853,ACT II.,"We'll send out villains to strip beggars, and"
17854,ACT II.,"Search empty pockets; also, to arrest                               70"
17855,ACT II.,"All gipsies, and ill-clothed and sallow people."
17856,ACT II.,"Prisoners we'll have at least, if not the culprit;"
17857,ACT II.,"And for the Baron's gold--if 'tis not found,"
17858,ACT II.,At least he shall have the full satisfaction
17859,ACT II.,Of melting twice its substance in the raising
17860,ACT II.,The ghost of this rouleau. Here's alchemy
17861,ACT II.,For your Lord's losses!
17862,ACT II.,
17863,ACT II.,_Fritz_.                He hath found a better.
17864,ACT II.,
17865,ACT II.,_Iden._ _Where?_
17866,ACT II.,
17867,ACT II.,_Fritz_.         In a most immense inheritance.
17868,ACT II.,"The late Count Siegendorf, his distant kinsman,"
17869,ACT II.,"Is dead near Prague, in his castle, and my Lord                     80"
17870,ACT II.,Is on his way to take possession.
17871,ACT II.,
17872,ACT II.,_Iden._                           Was there
17873,ACT II.,No heir?
17874,ACT II.,
17875,ACT II.,"_Fritz_. Oh, yes; but he has disappeared"
17876,ACT II.,"Long from the world's eye, and, perhaps, the world."
17877,ACT II.,"A prodigal son, beneath his father's ban"
17878,ACT II.,For the last twenty years; for whom his sire
17879,ACT II.,"Refused to kill the fatted calf; and, therefore,"
17880,ACT II.,"If living, he must chew the husks still. But"
17881,ACT II.,"The Baron would find means to silence him,"
17882,ACT II.,"Were he to re-appear: he's politic,"
17883,ACT II.,And has much influence with a certain court.                        90
17884,ACT II.,
17885,ACT II.,_Iden._ He's fortunate.
17886,ACT II.,
17887,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                'Tis true, there is a grandson,"
17888,ACT II.,"Whom the late Count reclaimed from his son's hands,"
17889,ACT II.,"And educated as his heir; but, then,"
17890,ACT II.,His birth is doubtful.
17891,ACT II.,
17892,ACT II.,_Iden._                How so?
17893,ACT II.,
17894,ACT II.,_Fritz_.                      His sire made
17895,ACT II.,"A left-hand, love, imprudent sort of marriage,"
17896,ACT II.,With an Italian exile's dark-eyed daughter:
17897,ACT II.,"Noble, they say, too; but no match for such"
17898,ACT II.,A house as Siegendorf's. The grandsire ill
17899,ACT II.,Could brook the alliance; and could ne'er be brought
17900,ACT II.,"To see the parents, though he took the son.                        100"
17901,ACT II.,
17902,ACT II.,"_Iden._ If he's a lad of mettle, he may yet"
17903,ACT II.,"Dispute your claim, and weave a web that may"
17904,ACT II.,Puzzle your Baron to unravel.
17905,ACT II.,
17906,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                      Why,"
17907,ACT II.,"For mettle, he has quite enough: they say,"
17908,ACT II.,He forms a happy mixture of his sire
17909,ACT II.,"And grandsire's qualities,--impetuous as"
17910,ACT II.,"The former, and deep as the latter; but"
17911,ACT II.,"The strangest is, that he too disappeared"
17912,ACT II.,Some months ago.
17913,ACT II.,
17914,ACT II.,_Iden._          The devil he did!
17915,ACT II.,
17916,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                          Why, yes:"
17917,ACT II.,"It must have been at _his_ suggestion, at                          110"
17918,ACT II.,An hour so critical as was the eve
17919,ACT II.,"Of the old man's death, whose heart was broken by it."
17920,ACT II.,
17921,ACT II.,_Iden._ Was there no cause assigned?
17922,ACT II.,
17923,ACT II.,"_Fritz_.                             Plenty, no doubt,"
17924,ACT II.,"And none, perhaps, the true one. Some averred"
17925,ACT II.,It was to seek his parents; some because
17926,ACT II.,The old man held his spirit in so strictly
17927,ACT II.,"(But that could scarce be, for he doted on him);"
17928,ACT II.,"A third believed he wished to serve in war,"
17929,ACT II.,"But, peace being made soon after his departure,"
17930,ACT II.,"He might have since returned, were that the motive;                120"
17931,ACT II.,"A fourth set charitably have surmised,"
17932,ACT II.,"As there was something strange and mystic in him,"
17933,ACT II.,That in the wild exuberance of his nature
17934,ACT II.,"He had joined the black bands[172], who lay waste Lusatia,"
17935,ACT II.,"The mountains of Bohemia and Silesia,"
17936,ACT II.,Since the last years of war had dwindled into
17937,ACT II.,A kind of general condottiero system
17938,ACT II.,"Of bandit-warfare; each troop with its chief,"
17939,ACT II.,And all against mankind.
17940,ACT II.,
17941,ACT II.,_Iden._                 That cannot be.
17942,ACT II.,"A young heir, bred to wealth and luxury,                           130"
17943,ACT II.,To risk his life and honours with disbanded
17944,ACT II.,Soldiers and desperadoes!
17945,ACT II.,
17946,ACT II.,_Fritz_.                  Heaven best knows!
17947,ACT II.,But there are human natures so allied
17948,ACT II.,"Unto the savage love of enterprise,"
17949,ACT II.,That they will seek for peril as a pleasure.
17950,ACT II.,"I've heard that nothing can reclaim your Indian,"
17951,ACT II.,"Or tame the tiger, though their infancy"
17952,ACT II.,"Were fed on milk and honey. After all,"
17953,ACT II.,"Your Wallenstein, your Tilly and Gustavus,"
17954,ACT II.,"Your Bannier, and your Torstenson and Weimar[173],                 140"
17955,ACT II.,Were but the same thing upon a grand scale;
17956,ACT II.,"And now that they are gone, and peace proclaimed,"
17957,ACT II.,They who would follow the same pastime must
17958,ACT II.,Pursue it on their own account. Here comes
17959,ACT II.,"The Baron, and the Saxon stranger, who"
17960,ACT II.,"Was his chief aid in yesterday's escape,"
17961,ACT II.,But did not leave the cottage by the Oder
17962,ACT II.,Until this morning.
17963,ACT II.,
17964,ACT II.,_Enter_ STRALENHEIM _and_ ULRIC.
17965,ACT II.,
17966,ACT II.,_Stral._            Since you have refused
17967,ACT II.,"All compensation, gentle stranger, save"
17968,ACT II.,"Inadequate thanks, you almost check even them,                     150"
17969,ACT II.,"Making me feel the worthlessness of words,"
17970,ACT II.,"And blush at my own barren gratitude,"
17971,ACT II.,"They seem so niggardly, compared with what"
17972,ACT II.,Your courteous courage did in my behalf----
17973,ACT II.,
17974,ACT II.,_Ulr._ I pray you press the theme no further.
17975,ACT II.,
17976,ACT II.,_Stral._                                      But
17977,ACT II.,"Can I not serve you? You are young, and of"
17978,ACT II.,That mould which throws out heroes; fair in favour;
17979,ACT II.,"Brave, I know, by my living now to say so;"
17980,ACT II.,"And, doubtlessly, with such a form and heart,"
17981,ACT II.,"Would look into the fiery eyes of War,                             160"
17982,ACT II.,As ardently for glory as you dared
17983,ACT II.,"An obscure death to save an unknown stranger,"
17984,ACT II.,"In an as perilous, but opposite, element."
17985,ACT II.,You are made for the service: I have served;
17986,ACT II.,"Have rank by birth and soldiership, and friends,"
17987,ACT II.,Who shall be yours. 'Tis true this pause of peace
17988,ACT II.,Favours such views at present scantily;
17989,ACT II.,"But 'twill not last, men's spirits are too stirring;"
17990,ACT II.,"And, after thirty years of conflict, peace"
17991,ACT II.,"Is but a petty war, as the time shows us                           170"
17992,ACT II.,"In every forest, or a mere armed truce."
17993,ACT II.,"War will reclaim his own; and, in the meantime,"
17994,ACT II.,"You might obtain a post, which would ensure"
17995,ACT II.,"A higher soon, and, by my influence, fail not"
17996,ACT II.,"To rise. I speak of Brandenburgh, wherein"
17997,ACT II.,"I stand well with the Elector[174]; in Bohemia,"
17998,ACT II.,"Like you, I am a stranger, and we are now"
17999,ACT II.,Upon its frontier.
18000,ACT II.,
18001,ACT II.,_Ulr._             You perceive my garb
18002,ACT II.,"Is Saxon, and, of course, my service due"
18003,ACT II.,To my own Sovereign. If I must decline                             180
18004,ACT II.,"Your offer, 'tis with the same feeling which"
18005,ACT II.,Induced it.
18006,ACT II.,
18007,ACT II.,"_Stral._    Why, this is mere usury!"
18008,ACT II.,"I owe my life to you, and you refuse"
18009,ACT II.,"The acquittance of the interest of the debt,"
18010,ACT II.,"To heap more obligations on me, till"
18011,ACT II.,I bow beneath them.
18012,ACT II.,
18013,ACT II.,_Ulr._              You shall say so when
18014,ACT II.,I claim the payment.
18015,ACT II.,
18016,ACT II.,"_Stral._             Well, sir, since you will not--"
18017,ACT II.,You are nobly born?
18018,ACT II.,
18019,ACT II.,_Ulr._              I have heard my kinsmen say so.
18020,ACT II.,
18021,ACT II.,_Stral._ Your actions show it. Might I ask your name?
18022,ACT II.,
18023,ACT II.,_Ulr._ Ulric.
18024,ACT II.,
18025,ACT II.,_Stral._      Your house's?
18026,ACT II.,
18027,ACT II.,"_Ulr._                     When I'm worthy of it,                  190"
18028,ACT II.,I'll answer you.
18029,ACT II.,
18030,ACT II.,"_Stral._ (_aside_). Most probably an Austrian,"
18031,ACT II.,Whom these unsettled times forbid to boast
18032,ACT II.,"His lineage on these wild and dangerous frontiers,"
18033,ACT II.,Where the name of his country is abhorred.
18034,ACT II.,[_Aloud to_ FRITZ _and_ IDENSTEIN.
18035,ACT II.,"So, sirs! how have ye sped in your researches?"
18036,ACT II.,
18037,ACT II.,"_Iden._ Indifferent well, your Excellency."
18038,ACT II.,
18039,ACT II.,_Stral._                                   Then
18040,ACT II.,I am to deem the plunderer is caught?
18041,ACT II.,
18042,ACT II.,_Iden._ Humph!--not exactly.
18043,ACT II.,
18044,ACT II.,"_Stral._                     Or, at least, suspected?"
18045,ACT II.,
18046,ACT II.,"_Iden._ Oh! for that matter, very much suspected."
18047,ACT II.,
18048,ACT II.,_Stral._ Who may he be?
18049,ACT II.,
18050,ACT II.,"_Iden._                 Why, don't _you_ know, my Lord?            200"
18051,ACT II.,
18052,ACT II.,_Stral._ How should I? I was fast asleep.
18053,ACT II.,
18054,ACT II.,_Iden._                                   And so
18055,ACT II.,Was I--and that's the cause I know no more
18056,ACT II.,Than does your Excellency.
18057,ACT II.,
18058,ACT II.,_Stral._                   Dolt!
18059,ACT II.,
18060,ACT II.,"_Iden._                         Why, if"
18061,ACT II.,"Your Lordship, being robbed, don't recognise"
18062,ACT II.,"The rogue; how should I, not being robbed, identify"
18063,ACT II.,"The thief among so many? In the crowd,"
18064,ACT II.,"May it please your Excellency, your thief looks"
18065,ACT II.,"Exactly like the rest, or rather better:"
18066,ACT II.,"'Tis only at the bar and in the dungeon,"
18067,ACT II.,That wise men know your felon by his features;                     210
18068,ACT II.,"But I'll engage, that if seen there but once,"
18069,ACT II.,"Whether he be found criminal or no,"
18070,ACT II.,His face shall be so.
18071,ACT II.,
18072,ACT II.,"_Stral._ (_to_ FRITZ). Prithee, Fritz, inform me"
18073,ACT II.,What hath been done to trace the fellow?
18074,ACT II.,
18075,ACT II.,_Fritz_.                                 Faith!
18076,ACT II.,"My Lord, not much as yet, except conjecture."
18077,ACT II.,
18078,ACT II.,"_Stral._ Besides the loss (which, I must own, affects me"
18079,ACT II.,"Just now materially), I needs would find"
18080,ACT II.,The villain out of public motives; for
18081,ACT II.,"So dexterous a spoiler, who could creep"
18082,ACT II.,"Through my attendants, and so many peopled                         220"
18083,ACT II.,"And lighted chambers, on my rest, and snatch"
18084,ACT II.,"The gold before my scarce-closed eyes, would soon"
18085,ACT II.,"Leave bare your borough, Sir Intendant!"
18086,ACT II.,
18087,ACT II.,_Iden._                                True;
18088,ACT II.,"If there were aught to carry off, my Lord."
18089,ACT II.,
18090,ACT II.,_Ulr._ What is all this?
18091,ACT II.,
18092,ACT II.,"_Stral._                 You joined us but this morning,"
18093,ACT II.,And have not heard that I was robbed last night.
18094,ACT II.,
18095,ACT II.,_Ulr._ Some rumour of it reached me as I passed
18096,ACT II.,"The outer chambers of the palace, but"
18097,ACT II.,I know no further.
18098,ACT II.,
18099,ACT II.,_Stral._           It is a strange business:
18100,ACT II.,The Intendant can inform you of the facts.                         230
18101,ACT II.,
18102,ACT II.,_Iden._ Most willingly. You see----
18103,ACT II.,
18104,ACT II.,"_Stral._ (_impatiently_).          Defer your tale,"
18105,ACT II.,Till certain of the hearer's patience.
18106,ACT II.,
18107,ACT II.,_Iden._                                That
18108,ACT II.,Can only be approved by proofs. You see----
18109,ACT II.,
18110,ACT II.,"_Stral._ (_again interrupting him, and addressing_ ULRIC)."
18111,ACT II.,"In short, I was asleep upon my chair,"
18112,ACT II.,"My cabinet before me, with some gold"
18113,ACT II.,"Upon it (more than I much like to lose,"
18114,ACT II.,Though in part only): some ingenious person
18115,ACT II.,"Contrived to glide through all my own attendants,"
18116,ACT II.,"Besides those of the place, and bore away"
18117,ACT II.,"A hundred golden ducats, which to find                             240"
18118,ACT II.,"I would be fain, and there's an end. Perhaps"
18119,ACT II.,You (as I still am rather faint) would add
18120,ACT II.,"To yesterday's great obligation, this,"
18121,ACT II.,"Though slighter, yet not slight, to aid these men"
18122,ACT II.,(Who seem but lukewarm) in recovering it?
18123,ACT II.,
18124,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ Most willingly, and without loss of time--"
18125,ACT II.,"(_To_ IDENSTEIN.) Come hither, mynheer!"
18126,ACT II.,
18127,ACT II.,_Iden._                               But so much haste bodes
18128,ACT II.,"Right little speed, and----"
18129,ACT II.,
18130,ACT II.,_Ulr._                      Standing motionless
18131,ACT II.,None; so let's march: we'll talk as we go on.
18132,ACT II.,
18133,ACT II.,_Iden._ But----
18134,ACT II.,
18135,ACT II.,"_Ulr._          Show the spot, and then I'll answer you.           250"
18136,ACT II.,
18137,ACT II.,"_Fritz_. I will, sir, with his Excellency's leave."
18138,ACT II.,
18139,ACT II.,"_Stral._ Do so, and take yon old ass with you."
18140,ACT II.,
18141,ACT II.,_Fritz_.                                       Hence!
18142,ACT II.,
18143,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ Come on, old oracle, expound thy riddle!"
18144,ACT II.,[_Exit with_ IDENSTEIN _and_ FRITZ.
18145,ACT II.,
18146,ACT II.,"_Stral._ (_solus_). A stalwart, active, soldier-looking stripling,"
18147,ACT II.,"Handsome as Hercules ere his first labour,"
18148,ACT II.,And with a brow of thought beyond his years
18149,ACT II.,"When in repose, till his eye kindles up"
18150,ACT II.,In answering yours. I wish I could engage him:
18151,ACT II.,"I have need of some such spirits near me now,"
18152,ACT II.,For this inheritance is worth a struggle.                          260
18153,ACT II.,"And though I am not the man to yield without one,"
18154,ACT II.,Neither are they who now rise up between me
18155,ACT II.,"And my desire. The boy, they say, 's a bold one;"
18156,ACT II.,But he hath played the truant in some hour
18157,ACT II.,"Of freakish folly, leaving fortune to"
18158,ACT II.,"Champion his claims. That's well. The father, whom"
18159,ACT II.,"For years I've tracked, as does the blood-hound, never"
18160,ACT II.,"In sight, but constantly in scent, had put me"
18161,ACT II.,"To fault; but _here_ I _have_ him, and that's better."
18162,ACT II.,It must be _he_! All circumstance proclaims it;                    270
18163,ACT II.,"And careless voices, knowing not the cause"
18164,ACT II.,"Of my enquiries, still confirm it.--Yes!"
18165,ACT II.,"The man, his bearing, and the mystery"
18166,ACT II.,"Of his arrival, and the time; the account, too,"
18167,ACT II.,The Intendant gave (for I have not beheld her)
18168,ACT II.,Of his wife's dignified but foreign aspect;
18169,ACT II.,"Besides the antipathy with which we met,"
18170,ACT II.,As snakes and lions shrink back from each other
18171,ACT II.,By secret instinct that both must be foes
18172,ACT II.,"Deadly, without being natural prey to either;                      280"
18173,ACT II.,"All--all--confirm it to my mind. However,"
18174,ACT II.,"We'll grapple, ne'ertheless. In a few hours"
18175,ACT II.,"The order comes from Frankfort, if these waters"
18176,ACT II.,Rise not the higher (and the weather favours
18177,ACT II.,"Their quick abatement), and I'll have him safe"
18178,ACT II.,"Within a dungeon, where he may avouch"
18179,ACT II.,"His real estate and name; and there's no harm done,"
18180,ACT II.,Should he prove other than I deem. This robbery
18181,ACT II.,(Save for the actual loss) is lucky also;
18182,ACT II.,"He's poor, and that's suspicious--he's unknown,                    290"
18183,ACT II.,"And that's defenceless.--True, we have no proofs"
18184,ACT II.,Of guilt--but what hath he of innocence?
18185,ACT II.,"Were he a man indifferent to my prospects,"
18186,ACT II.,"In other bearings, I should rather lay"
18187,ACT II.,"The inculpation on the Hungarian, who"
18188,ACT II.,Hath something which I like not; and alone
18189,ACT II.,"Of all around, except the Intendant, and"
18190,ACT II.,"The Prince's household and my own, had ingress"
18191,ACT II.,Familiar to the chamber.
18192,ACT II.,
18193,ACT II.,_Enter_ GABOR.
18194,ACT II.,
18195,ACT II.,"Friend, how fare you?"
18196,ACT II.,
18197,ACT II.,"_Gab._ As those who fare well everywhere, when they                300"
18198,ACT II.,"Have supped and slumbered, no great matter how--"
18199,ACT II.,"And you, my Lord?"
18200,ACT II.,
18201,ACT II.,_Stral._          Better in rest than purse:
18202,ACT II.,Mine inn is like to cost me dear.
18203,ACT II.,
18204,ACT II.,_Gab._                           I heard
18205,ACT II.,Of your late loss; but 'tis a trifle to
18206,ACT II.,One of your order.
18207,ACT II.,
18208,ACT II.,"_Stral._           You would hardly think so,"
18209,ACT II.,Were the loss yours.
18210,ACT II.,
18211,ACT II.,_Gab._               I never had so much
18212,ACT II.,"(At once) in my whole life, and therefore am not"
18213,ACT II.,Fit to decide. But I came here to seek you.
18214,ACT II.,"Your couriers are turned back--I have outstripped them,"
18215,ACT II.,In my return.
18216,ACT II.,
18217,ACT II.,_Stral._      You!--Why?
18218,ACT II.,
18219,ACT II.,"_Gab._                  I went at daybreak,                        310"
18220,ACT II.,"To watch for the abatement of the river,"
18221,ACT II.,As being anxious to resume my journey.
18222,ACT II.,Your messengers were all checked like myself;
18223,ACT II.,"And, seeing the case hopeless, I await"
18224,ACT II.,The current's pleasure.
18225,ACT II.,
18226,ACT II.,_Stral._                Would the dogs were in it!
18227,ACT II.,"Why did they not, at least, attempt the passage?"
18228,ACT II.,I ordered this at all risks.
18229,ACT II.,
18230,ACT II.,_Gab._                       Could you order
18231,ACT II.,"The Oder to divide, as Moses did"
18232,ACT II.,The Red Sea (scarcely redder than the flood
18233,ACT II.,"Of the swoln stream), and be obeyed, perhaps                       320"
18234,ACT II.,They might have ventured.
18235,ACT II.,
18236,ACT II.,_Stral._                 I must see to it:
18237,ACT II.,The knaves! the slaves!--but they shall smart for this.
18238,ACT II.,[_Exit_ STRALENHEIM.
18239,ACT II.,
18240,ACT II.,"_Gab._ (_solus_). There goes my noble, feudal, self-willed Baron!"
18241,ACT II.,Epitome of what brave chivalry
18242,ACT II.,The preux Chevaliers of the good old times
18243,ACT II.,Have left us. Yesterday he would have given
18244,ACT II.,"His lands[175] (if he hath any), and, still dearer,"
18245,ACT II.,"His sixteen quarterings, for as much fresh air"
18246,ACT II.,"As would have filled a bladder, while he lay"
18247,ACT II.,Gurgling and foaming half way through the window                   330
18248,ACT II.,Of his o'erset and water-logged conveyance;
18249,ACT II.,And now he storms at half a dozen wretches
18250,ACT II.,"Because they love their lives too! Yet, he's right:"
18251,ACT II.,"'Tis strange they should, when such as he may put them"
18252,ACT II.,"To hazard at his pleasure. Oh, thou world!"
18253,ACT II.,Thou art indeed a melancholy jest!                      [_Exit_ GABOR.

18306,ACT II.,_Wer._ (_starting_).          Hush! boy--
18307,ACT II.,The walls may hear that name!
18308,ACT II.,
18309,ACT II.,_Ulr._                        What then?
18310,ACT II.,
18311,ACT II.,"_Wer._                                  Why, then--"
18312,ACT II.,"But we will talk of that anon. Remember,"
18313,ACT II.,I must be known here but as Werner. Come!
18314,ACT II.,"Come to my arms again! Why, thou look'st all"
18315,ACT II.,"I should have been, and was not. Josephine!"
18316,ACT II.,Sure 'tis no father's fondness dazzles me;
18317,ACT II.,"But, had I seen that form amid ten thousand"
18318,ACT II.,"Youth of the choicest, my heart would have chosen"
18319,ACT II.,This for my son!
18320,ACT II.,
18321,ACT II.,_Ulr._           And yet you knew me not!                           30
18322,ACT II.,
18323,ACT II.,_Wer._ Alas! I have had that upon my soul
18324,ACT II.,Which makes me look on all men with an eye
18325,ACT II.,That only knows the evil at first glance.
18326,ACT II.,
18327,ACT II.,_Ulr._ My memory served me far more fondly: I
18328,ACT II.,Have not forgotten aught; and oft-times in
18329,ACT II.,"The proud and princely halls of--(I'll not name them,"
18330,ACT II.,As you say that 'tis perilous)--but i' the pomp
18331,ACT II.,"Of your sire's feudal mansion, I looked back"
18332,ACT II.,"To the Bohemian mountains many a sunset,"
18333,ACT II.,And wept to see another day go down                                 40
18334,ACT II.,"O'er thee and me, with those huge hills between us."
18335,ACT II.,They shall not part us more.
18336,ACT II.,
18337,ACT II.,_Wer._                      I know not that.
18338,ACT II.,Are you aware my father is no more?
18339,ACT II.,
18340,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ Oh, Heavens! I left him in a green old age,"
18341,ACT II.,"And looking like the oak, worn, but still steady"
18342,ACT II.,"Amidst the elements, whilst younger trees"
18343,ACT II.,Fell fast around him. 'Twas scarce three months since.
18344,ACT II.,
18345,ACT II.,_Wer._ Why did you leave him?
18346,ACT II.,
18347,ACT II.,_Jos._ (_embracing_ ULRIC). Can you ask that question?
18348,ACT II.,Is he not _here_?
18349,ACT II.,
18350,ACT II.,"_Wer._           True; he hath sought his parents,"
18351,ACT II.,"And found them; but, oh! _how_, and in what state!                  50"
18352,ACT II.,
18353,ACT II.,_Ulr._ All shall be bettered. What we have to do
18354,ACT II.,"Is to proceed, and to assert our rights,"
18355,ACT II.,"Or rather yours; for I waive all, unless"
18356,ACT II.,Your father has disposed in such a sort
18357,ACT II.,"Of his broad lands as to make mine the foremost,"
18358,ACT II.,So that I must prefer my claim for form:
18359,ACT II.,"But I trust better, and that all is yours."
18360,ACT II.,
18361,ACT II.,_Wer._ Have you not heard of Stralenheim?
18362,ACT II.,
18363,ACT II.,_Ulr._                                   I saved
18364,ACT II.,His life but yesterday: he's here.
18365,ACT II.,
18366,ACT II.,_Wer._                             You saved
18367,ACT II.,The serpent who will sting us all!
18368,ACT II.,
18369,ACT II.,_Ulr._                             You speak                        60
18370,ACT II.,Riddles: what is this Stralenheim to us?
18371,ACT II.,
18372,ACT II.,_Wer._ Every thing. One who claims our father's lands:
18373,ACT II.,"Our distant kinsman, and our nearest foe."
18374,ACT II.,
18375,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ I never heard his name till now. The Count,"
18376,ACT II.,"Indeed, spoke sometimes of a kinsman, who,"
18377,ACT II.,"If his own line should fail, might be remotely"
18378,ACT II.,Involved in the succession; but his titles
18379,ACT II.,Were never named before me--and what then?
18380,ACT II.,His right must yield to ours.
18381,ACT II.,
18382,ACT II.,"_Wer._                       Aye, if at Prague:"
18383,ACT II.,But here he is all-powerful; and has spread                         70
18384,ACT II.,"Snares for thy father, which, if hitherto"
18385,ACT II.,"He hath escaped them, is by fortune, not"
18386,ACT II.,By favour.
18387,ACT II.,
18388,ACT II.,_Ulr._      Doth he personally know you?
18389,ACT II.,
18390,ACT II.,"_Wer._ No; but he guesses shrewdly at my person,"
18391,ACT II.,"As he betrayed last night; and I, perhaps,"
18392,ACT II.,But owe my temporary liberty
18393,ACT II.,To his uncertainty.
18394,ACT II.,
18395,ACT II.,_Ulr._             I think you wrong him
18396,ACT II.,(Excuse me for the phrase); but Stralenheim
18397,ACT II.,"Is not what you prejudge him, or, if so,"
18398,ACT II.,He owes me something both for past and present.                     80
18399,ACT II.,"I saved his life, he therefore trusts in me."
18400,ACT II.,"He hath been plundered too, since he came hither:"
18401,ACT II.,"Is sick, a stranger, and as such not now"
18402,ACT II.,Able to trace the villain who hath robbed him:
18403,ACT II.,I have pledged myself to do so; and the business
18404,ACT II.,Which brought me here was chiefly that:[176] but I
18405,ACT II.,"Have found, in searching for another's dross,"
18406,ACT II.,"My own whole treasure--you, my parents!"
18407,ACT II.,
18408,ACT II.,_Wer._ (_agitatedly_).                   Who
18409,ACT II.,"Taught you to mouth that name of ""villain?"""
18410,ACT II.,
18411,ACT II.,_Ulr._                                      What
18412,ACT II.,More noble name belongs to common thieves?                          90
18413,ACT II.,
18414,ACT II.,_Wer._ Who taught you thus to brand an unknown being
18415,ACT II.,With an infernal stigma?
18416,ACT II.,
18417,ACT II.,_Ulr._                  My own feelings
18418,ACT II.,Taught me to name a ruffian from his deeds.
18419,ACT II.,
18420,ACT II.,"_Wer._ Who taught you, long-sought and ill-found boy! that"
18421,ACT II.,It would be safe for my own son to insult me?
18422,ACT II.,
18423,ACT II.,_Ulr._ I named a villain. What is there in common
18424,ACT II.,With such a being and my father?
18425,ACT II.,
18426,ACT II.,_Wer._                          Every thing!
18427,ACT II.,That ruffian is thy father![177]
18428,ACT II.,
18429,ACT II.,"_Jos._                      Oh, my son!"
18430,ACT II.,Believe him not--and yet!--(_her voice falters_.)
18431,ACT II.,
18432,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ (_starts, looks earnestly at_ WERNER"
18433,ACT II.,_and then says slowly_) And you avow it?
18434,ACT II.,
18435,ACT II.,"_Wer._ Ulric, before you dare despise your father,                 100"
18436,ACT II.,"Learn to divine and judge his actions. Young,"
18437,ACT II.,"Rash, new to life, and reared in Luxury's lap,"
18438,ACT II.,"Is it for you to measure Passion's force,"
18439,ACT II.,"Or Misery's temptation? Wait--(not long,"
18440,ACT II.,"It cometh like the night, and quickly)--Wait!--"
18441,ACT II.,"Wait till, like me, your hopes are blighted[178] till"
18442,ACT II.,Sorrow and Shame are handmaids of your cabin--
18443,ACT II.,Famine and Poverty your guests at table;
18444,ACT II.,"Despair your bed-fellow--then rise, but not"
18445,ACT II.,"From sleep, and judge! Should that day e'er arrive--               110"
18446,ACT II.,"Should you see then the Serpent, who hath coiled"
18447,ACT II.,Himself around all that is dear and noble
18448,ACT II.,"Of you and yours, lie slumbering in your path,"
18449,ACT II.,"With but _his_ folds between your steps and happiness,"
18450,ACT II.,"When _he_, who lives but to tear from you name,"
18451,ACT II.,"Lands, life itself, lies at your mercy, with"
18452,ACT II.,Chance your conductor--midnight for your mantle--
18453,ACT II.,"The bare knife in your hand, and earth asleep,"
18454,ACT II.,Even to your deadliest foe; and he as 'twere
18455,ACT II.,"Inviting death, by looking like it, while                          120"
18456,ACT II.,His death alone can save you:--Thank your God!
18457,ACT II.,"If then, like me, content with petty plunder,"
18458,ACT II.,You turn aside----I did so.
18459,ACT II.,
18460,ACT II.,_Ulr._                     But----
18461,ACT II.,
18462,ACT II.,_Wer._ (_abruptly_).               Hear me!
18463,ACT II.,I will not brook a human voice--scarce dare
18464,ACT II.,Listen to my own (if that be human still)--
18465,ACT II.,Hear me! you do not know this man--I do.[179]
18466,ACT II.,"He's mean, deceitful, avaricious. You"
18467,ACT II.,"Deem yourself safe, as young and brave; but learn"
18468,ACT II.,"None are secure from desperation, few"
18469,ACT II.,"From subtilty. My worst foe, Stralenheim,                          130"
18470,ACT II.,"Housed in a Prince's palace, couched within"
18471,ACT II.,"A Prince's chamber, lay below my knife!"
18472,ACT II.,An instant--a mere motion--the least impulse--
18473,ACT II.,Had swept him and all fears of mine from earth.
18474,ACT II.,He was within my power--my knife was raised--
18475,ACT II.,Withdrawn--and I'm in his:--are you not so?
18476,ACT II.,Who tells you that he knows you _not?_ Who says
18477,ACT II.,He hath not lured you here to end you? or
18478,ACT II.,"To plunge you, with your parents, in a dungeon?"
18479,ACT II.,[_He pauses_.
18480,ACT II.,
18481,ACT II.,_Ulr._ Proceed--proceed!
18482,ACT II.,

18484,ACT II.,And hunted through each change of time--name--fortune--
18485,ACT II.,And why not _you?_ Are you more versed in men?
18486,ACT II.,He wound snares round me; flung along my path

18488,ACT II.,"Even from my presence; but, in spurning now,"
18489,ACT II.,Fill only with fresh venom. Will you be
18490,ACT II.,More patient? Ulric!--Ulric!--there are crimes
18491,ACT II.,"Made venial by the occasion, and temptations"
18492,ACT II.,Which nature cannot master or forbear.[180]
18493,ACT II.,
18494,ACT II.,_Ulr._ (_who looks first at him and then at_ JOSEPHINE).
18495,ACT II.,My mother!
18496,ACT II.,
18497,ACT II.,_Wer._     Ah! I thought so: you have now                          150
18498,ACT II.,Only one parent. I have lost alike
18499,ACT II.,"Father and son, and stand alone."
18500,ACT II.,
18501,ACT II.,_Ulr._                          But stay!
18502,ACT II.,[WERNER _rushes out of the chamber_.
18503,ACT II.,
18504,ACT II.,"_Jos._ (_to_ ULRIC). Follow him not, until this storm of passion"

18506,ACT II.,I had not followed?
18507,ACT II.,
18508,ACT II.,"_Ulr._             I obey you, mother,"
18509,ACT II.,Although reluctantly. My first act shall not
18510,ACT II.,Be one of disobedience.

18513,ACT II.,"Condemn him not from his own mouth, but trust"

18515,ACT II.,"That this is but the surface of his soul,                          160"
18516,ACT II.,And that the depth is rich in better things.
18517,ACT II.,
18518,ACT II.,_Ulr._ These then are but my father's principles[181]?
18519,ACT II.,My mother thinks not with him?
18520,ACT II.,
18521,ACT II.,_Jos._                         Nor doth he
18522,ACT II.,Think as he speaks. Alas! long years of grief
18523,ACT II.,Have made him sometimes thus.
18524,ACT II.,
18525,ACT II.,_Ulr._                        Explain to me
18526,ACT II.,"More clearly, then, these claims of Stralenheim,"
18527,ACT II.,"That, when I see the subject in its bearings,"
18528,ACT II.,"I may prepare to face him, or at least"
18529,ACT II.,To extricate you from your present perils.
18530,ACT II.,I pledge myself to accomplish this--but would                      170
18531,ACT II.,I had arrived a few hours sooner!

18552,ACT II.,
18553,ACT II.,_Iden._ I thank you for the respite: but there are

18564,ACT II.,_Iden._              Wouldst have me suspect

18643,ACT II.,"I do not ask for hints, and surmises,                              220"
18644,ACT II.,"And circumstance, and proof: I know enough"
18645,ACT II.,"Of what I have done for you, and what you owe me,"
18646,ACT II.,To have at least waited your payment rather
18647,ACT II.,"Than paid myself, had I been eager of"
18648,ACT II.,"Your gold. I also know, that were I even"
18649,ACT II.,"The villain I am deemed, the service rendered"
18650,ACT II.,So recently would not permit you to
18651,ACT II.,"Pursue me to the death, except through shame,"
18652,ACT II.,Such as would leave your scutcheon but a blank.
18653,ACT II.,But this is nothing: I demand of you                               230
18654,ACT II.,"Justice upon your unjust servants, and"
18655,ACT II.,From your own lips a disavowal of
18656,ACT II.,All sanction of their insolence: thus much
18657,ACT II.,"You owe to the unknown, who asks no more,"
18658,ACT II.,And never thought to have asked so much.
18659,ACT II.,
18660,ACT II.,_Stral._                                This tone
18661,ACT II.,May be of innocence.
18662,ACT II.,
18663,ACT II.,"_Gab._              'Sdeath! who dare doubt it,"
18664,ACT II.,Except such villains as ne'er had it?
18665,ACT II.,
18666,ACT II.,_Stral._                              You
18667,ACT II.,"Are hot, sir."
18668,ACT II.,
18669,ACT II.,_Gab._        Must I turn an icicle
18670,ACT II.,"Before the breath of menials, and their master[cr]?"
18671,ACT II.,
18672,ACT II.,_Stral._ Ulric! you know this man; I found him in                  240
18673,ACT II.,_Your_ company.
18674,ACT II.,
18675,ACT II.,_Gab._         We found _you_ in the Oder;
18676,ACT II.,Would we had left you there!
18677,ACT II.,
18678,ACT II.,"_Stral._                    I give you thanks, sir."
18679,ACT II.,
18680,ACT II.,"_Gab._ I've earned them; but might have earned more from others,"
18681,ACT II.,"Perchance, if I had left you to your fate."
18682,ACT II.,
18683,ACT II.,_Stral._ Ulric! you know this man?
18684,ACT II.,
18685,ACT II.,_Gab._                             No more than you do
18686,ACT II.,If he avouches not my honour.
18687,ACT II.,
18688,ACT II.,_Ulr._                        I
18689,ACT II.,"Can vouch your courage, and, as far as my"
18690,ACT II.,"Own brief connection led me, honour."
18691,ACT II.,
18692,ACT II.,_Stral._                             Then
18693,ACT II.,I'm satisfied.
18694,ACT II.,
18695,ACT II.,"_Gab._ (_ironically_). Right easily, methinks."
18696,ACT II.,What is the spell in his asseveration                              250
18697,ACT II.,More than in mine?
18698,ACT II.,
18699,ACT II.,_Stral._          I merely said that _I_
18700,ACT II.,Was satisfied--not that you are absolved.
18701,ACT II.,
18702,ACT II.,_Gab._ Again! Am I accused or no?
18703,ACT II.,
18704,ACT II.,_Stral._                          Go to!
18705,ACT II.,You wax too insolent. If circumstance
18706,ACT II.,"And general suspicion be against you,"
18707,ACT II.,Is the fault mine? Is't not enough that I
18708,ACT II.,Decline all question of your guilt or innocence?
18709,ACT II.,
18710,ACT II.,"_Gab._ My Lord, my Lord, this is mere cozenage[183],"
18711,ACT II.,A vile equivocation; you well know
18712,ACT II.,Your doubts are certainties to all around you--                    260
18713,ACT II.,Your looks a voice--your frowns a sentence; you
18714,ACT II.,Are practising your power on me--because
18715,ACT II.,You have it; but beware! you know not whom
18716,ACT II.,You strive to tread on.
18717,ACT II.,
18718,ACT II.,_Stral._               Threat'st thou?
18719,ACT II.,
18720,ACT II.,_Gab._                                Not so much
18721,ACT II.,"As you accuse. You hint the basest injury,"
18722,ACT II.,And I retort it with an open warning.
18723,ACT II.,
18724,ACT II.,"_Stral._ As you have said, 'tis true I owe you something,"
18725,ACT II.,For which you seem disposed to pay yourself.
18726,ACT II.,
18727,ACT II.,_Gab._ Not with your gold.
18728,ACT II.,
18729,ACT II.,_Stral._                   With bootless insolence.
18730,ACT II.,[_To his Attendants and_ IDENSTEIN.
18731,ACT II.,"You need not further to molest this man,                           270"
18732,ACT II.,"But let him go his way. Ulric, good morrow!"
18733,ACT II.,"[_Exit_ STRALENHEIM, IDENSTEIN, _and Attendants_."
18734,ACT II.,
18735,ACT II.,_Gab._ (_following_). I'll after him and----
18736,ACT II.,
18737,ACT II.,_Ulr._ (_stopping him_).                    Not a step.
18738,ACT II.,
18739,ACT II.,_Gab._                                                 Who shall
18740,ACT II.,Oppose me?
18741,ACT II.,
18742,ACT II.,"_Ulr._    Your own reason, with a moment's"
18743,ACT II.,Thought.
18744,ACT II.,
18745,ACT II.,_Gab._   Must I bear this?
18746,ACT II.,
18747,ACT II.,_Ulr._                   Pshaw! we all must bear
18748,ACT II.,The arrogance of something higher than
18749,ACT II.,"Ourselves--the highest cannot temper Satan,"
18750,ACT II.,Nor the lowest his vicegerents upon earth.
18751,ACT II.,"I've seen you brave the elements, and bear"
18752,ACT II.,Things which had made this silkworm[184] cast his skin--
18753,ACT II.,And shrink you from a few sharp sneers and words?                  280
18754,ACT II.,
18755,ACT II.,_Gab._ Must I bear to be deemed a thief? If 'twere
18756,ACT II.,"A bandit of the woods, I could have borne it--"
18757,ACT II.,There's something daring in it:--but to steal
18758,ACT II.,The moneys of a slumbering man!--
18759,ACT II.,
18760,ACT II.,"_Ulr._                            It seems, then,"
18761,ACT II.,You are _not_ guilty.
18762,ACT II.,
18763,ACT II.,_Gab._                Do I hear aright?
18764,ACT II.,_You_ too!
18765,ACT II.,
18766,ACT II.,_Ulr._     I merely asked a simple question.
18767,ACT II.,
18768,ACT II.,"_Gab._ If the judge asked me, I would answer ""No""--"
18769,ACT II.,To you I answer _thus_.                                   [_He draws_.
18770,ACT II.,
18771,ACT II.,_Ulr._ (_drawing_).     With all my heart!
18772,ACT II.,
18773,ACT II.,"_Jos._ Without there! Ho! help! help!--Oh, God!"
18774,ACT II.,"here's murder!                         [_Exit_ JOSEPHINE, _shrieking_."
18775,ACT II.,
18776,ACT II.,GABOR _and_ ULRIC _fight_. GABOR _is disarmed just as_
18777,ACT II.,"STRALENHEIM, JOSEPHINE, IDENSTEIN, _etc., re-enter_."
18778,ACT II.,
18779,ACT II.,_Jos._ Oh! glorious Heaven! He's safe!
18780,ACT II.,
18781,ACT II.,_Stral._ (_to_ JOSEPHINE).           _Who's_ safe!
18782,ACT II.,
18783,ACT II.,_Jos._                                            My----
18784,ACT II.,
18785,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ (_interrupting her with a stern look, and turning"
18786,ACT II.,afterwards to_ STRALENHEIM).                              Both!    290
18787,ACT II.,Here's no great harm done.
18788,ACT II.,
18789,ACT II.,_Stral._                  What hath caused all this?
18790,ACT II.,
18791,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ _You_, Baron, I believe; but as the effect"
18792,ACT II.,"Is harmless, let it not disturb you.--Gabor!"
18793,ACT II.,"There is your sword; and when you bare it next,"
18794,ACT II.,Let it not be against your _friends_.
18795,ACT II.,
18796,ACT II.,[ULRIC _pronounces the last words slowly and emphatically
18797,ACT II.,in a low voice to_ GABOR.
18798,ACT II.,
18799,ACT II.,_Gab._                               I thank you
18800,ACT II.,Less for my life than for your counsel.
18801,ACT II.,
18802,ACT II.,_Stral._                                These
18803,ACT II.,Brawls must end here.
18804,ACT II.,
18805,ACT II.,"_Gab._ (_taking his sword_). They _shall_. You've wronged me, Ulric,"
18806,ACT II.,More with your unkind thoughts than sword: I would
18807,ACT II.,The last were in my bosom rather than
18808,ACT II.,The first in yours. I could have borne yon noble's                 300
18809,ACT II.,Absurd insinuations--ignorance
18810,ACT II.,And dull suspicion are a part of his
18811,ACT II.,Entail will last him longer than his lands--
18812,ACT II.,But I may fit _him_ yet:--you have vanquished me.
18813,ACT II.,I was the fool of passion to conceive
18814,ACT II.,"That I could cope with you, whom I had seen"
18815,ACT II.,Already proved by greater perils than
18816,ACT II.,"Rest in this arm. We may meet by and by,"
18817,ACT II.,However--but in friendship.                             [_Exit_ GABOR.
18818,ACT II.,
18819,ACT II.,_Stral._                    I will brook
18820,ACT II.,"No more! This outrage following upon his insults,                  310"
18821,ACT II.,"Perhaps his guilt, has cancelled all the little"
18822,ACT II.,I owed him heretofore for the so-vaunted
18823,ACT II.,Aid which he added to your abler succour.
18824,ACT II.,"Ulric, you are not hurt?--"
18825,ACT II.,
18826,ACT II.,_Ulr._                     Not even by a scratch.
18827,ACT II.,
18828,ACT II.,_Stral._ (_to_ IDENSTEIN). Intendant! take your measures to secure
18829,ACT II.,Yon fellow: I revoke my former lenity.
18830,ACT II.,"He shall be sent to Frankfort with an escort,"
18831,ACT II.,The instant that the waters have abated.
18832,ACT II.,
18833,ACT II.,_Iden._ Secure him! He hath got his sword again----
18834,ACT II.,"And seems to know the use on't; 'tis his trade,                    320"
18835,ACT II.,Belike;--_I'm_ a civilian.
18836,ACT II.,
18837,ACT II.,_Stral._                   Fool! are not
18838,ACT II.,Yon score of vassals dogging at your heels
18839,ACT II.,Enough to seize a dozen such? Hence! after him!
18840,ACT II.,
18841,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ Baron, I do beseech you!"
18842,ACT II.,
18843,ACT II.,_Stral._                        I must be
18844,ACT II.,Obeyed. No words!
18845,ACT II.,
18846,ACT II.,"_Iden._           Well, if it must be so--"
18847,ACT II.,"March, vassals! I'm your leader, and will bring"
18848,ACT II.,The rear up: a wise general never should
18849,ACT II.,Expose his precious life--on which all rests.
18850,ACT II.,I like that article of war.
18851,ACT II.,[_Exit_ IDENSTEIN _and Attendants_.
18852,ACT II.,
18853,ACT II.,"_Stral._                    Come hither,"
18854,ACT II.,Ulric; what does that woman here? Oh! now                          330
18855,ACT II.,"I recognise her, 'tis the stranger's wife"
18856,ACT II.,"Whom they _name_ ""Werner."""
18857,ACT II.,
18858,ACT II.,_Ulr._                    'Tis his name.
18859,ACT II.,
18860,ACT II.,_Stral._                                Indeed!
18861,ACT II.,"Is not your husband visible, fair dame?--"
18862,ACT II.,
18863,ACT II.,_Jos._ Who seeks him?
18864,ACT II.,
18865,ACT II.,_Stral._             No one--for the present: but
18866,ACT II.,"I fain would parley, Ulric, with yourself"
18867,ACT II.,Alone.
18868,ACT II.,
18869,ACT II.,_Ulr._ I will retire with you.
18870,ACT II.,
18871,ACT II.,_Jos._                         Not so:
18872,ACT II.,"You are the latest stranger, and command"
18873,ACT II.,All places here.
18874,ACT II.,"(_Aside to_ ULRIC, _as she goes out_.) O Ulric! have a care--"

18878,ACT II.,[_Exit_ JOSEPHINE.
18879,ACT II.,
18880,ACT II.,"_Stral._ Ulric, I think that I may trust you;                      340"
18881,ACT II.,You saved my life--and acts like these beget
18882,ACT II.,Unbounded confidence.
18883,ACT II.,
18884,ACT II.,_Ulr._                Say on.
18885,ACT II.,
18886,ACT II.,_Stral._                     Mysterious
18887,ACT II.,And long-engendered circumstances (not
18888,ACT II.,To be now fully entered on) have made
18889,ACT II.,This man obnoxious--perhaps fatal to me.
18890,ACT II.,
18891,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ Who? Gabor, the Hungarian?"
18892,ACT II.,
18893,ACT II.,"_Stral._                         No--this ""Werner""--"
18894,ACT II.,With the false name and habit.
18895,ACT II.,
18896,ACT II.,_Ulr._                       How can this be?
18897,ACT II.,He is the poorest of the poor--and yellow
18898,ACT II.,Sickness sits caverned in his hollow eye[cs]:
18899,ACT II.,The man is helpless.
18900,ACT II.,
18901,ACT II.,_Stral._            He is--'tis no matter;--                       350
18902,ACT II.,But if he be the man I deem (and that
18903,ACT II.,"He is so, all around us here--and much"
18904,ACT II.,That is not here--confirm my apprehension)
18905,ACT II.,He must be made secure ere twelve hours further.
18906,ACT II.,
18907,ACT II.,_Ulr._ And what have I to do with this?
18908,ACT II.,
18909,ACT II.,_Stral._                                I have sent
18910,ACT II.,"To Frankfort, to the Governor, my friend,"
18911,ACT II.,(I have the authority to do so by
18912,ACT II.,"An order of the house of Brandenburgh),"
18913,ACT II.,For a fit escort--but this curséd flood
18914,ACT II.,"Bars all access, and may do for some hours.                        360"
18915,ACT II.,
18916,ACT II.,_Ulr._ It is abating.
18917,ACT II.,
18918,ACT II.,_Stral._              That is well.
18919,ACT II.,
18920,ACT II.,_Ulr._                             But how
18921,ACT II.,Am I concerned?
18922,ACT II.,
18923,ACT II.,_Stral._        As one who did so much
18924,ACT II.,"For me, you cannot be indifferent to"
18925,ACT II.,That which is of more import to me than
18926,ACT II.,The life you rescued.--Keep your eye on _him_!
18927,ACT II.,"The man avoids me, knows that I now know him.--"
18928,ACT II.,Watch him!--as you would watch the wild boar when
18929,ACT II.,He makes against you in the hunter's gap--
18930,ACT II.,Like him he must be speared.
18931,ACT II.,
18932,ACT II.,_Ulr._                       Why so?
18933,ACT II.,
18934,ACT II.,_Stral._                            He stands
18935,ACT II.,Between me and a brave inheritance!                                370
18936,ACT II.,Oh! could you see it! But you shall.
18937,ACT II.,
18938,ACT II.,_Ulr._                               I hope so.
18939,ACT II.,
18940,ACT II.,"_Stral._ It is the richest of the rich Bohemia,"
18941,ACT II.,Unscathed by scorching war. It lies so near
18942,ACT II.,"The strongest city, Prague, that fire and sword"
18943,ACT II.,"Have skimmed it lightly: so that now, besides"
18944,ACT II.,"Its own exuberance, it bears double value"
18945,ACT II.,Confronted with whole realms far and near
18946,ACT II.,Made deserts.
18947,ACT II.,
18948,ACT II.,_Ulr._       You describe it faithfully.
18949,ACT II.,
18950,ACT II.,"_Stral._ Aye--could you see it, you would say so--but,"
18951,ACT II.,"As I have said, you shall."
18952,ACT II.,
18953,ACT II.,_Ulr._                     I accept the omen.                      380
18954,ACT II.,
18955,ACT II.,"_Stral._ Then claim a recompense from it and me,"
18956,ACT II.,Such as _both_ may make worthy your acceptance
18957,ACT II.,And services to me and mine for ever.
18958,ACT II.,
18959,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ And this sole, sick, and miserable wretch--"
18960,ACT II.,This way-worn stranger--stands between you and
18961,ACT II.,This Paradise?--(As Adam did between

18963,ACT II.,
18964,ACT II.,_Stral._                      He doth.
18965,ACT II.,
18966,ACT II.,_Ulr._                               Hath he no right?
18967,ACT II.,
18968,ACT II.,"_Stral._ Right! none. A disinherited prodigal,"
18969,ACT II.,Who for these twenty years disgraced his lineage
18970,ACT II.,"In all his acts--but chiefly by his marriage,                      390"
18971,ACT II.,"And living amidst commerce-fetching burghers,"
18972,ACT II.,"And dabbling merchants, in a mart of Jews."

18974,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ He has a wife, then?"
18975,ACT II.,
18976,ACT II.,_Stral._                    You'd be sorry to
18977,ACT II.,Call such your mother. You have seen the woman
18978,ACT II.,He _calls_ his wife.
18979,ACT II.,
18980,ACT II.,_Ulr._               Is she not so?
18981,ACT II.,
18982,ACT II.,_Stral._                           No more
18983,ACT II.,"Than he's your father:--an Italian girl,"
18984,ACT II.,"The daughter of a banished man, who lives"
18985,ACT II.,On love and poverty with this same Werner.
18986,ACT II.,
18987,ACT II.,"_Ulr._ They are childless, then?"
18988,ACT II.,
18989,ACT II.,"_Stral._                        There is or was a bastard,"
18990,ACT II.,Whom the old man--the grandsire (as old age                        400
18991,ACT II.,"Is ever doting) took to warm his bosom,"
18992,ACT II.,As it went chilly downward to the grave:
18993,ACT II.,"But the imp stands not in my path--he has fled,"
18994,ACT II.,"No one knows whither; and if he had not,"
18995,ACT II.,His claims alone were too contemptible
18996,ACT II.,To stand.--Why do you smile?
18997,ACT II.,
18998,ACT II.,_Ulr._                      At your vain fears:
18999,ACT II.,A poor man almost in his grasp--a child
19000,ACT II.,Of doubtful birth--can startle a grandee!
19001,ACT II.,
19002,ACT II.,"_Stral._ All's to be feared, where all is to be gained."
19003,ACT II.,
19004,ACT II.,_Ulr._ True; and aught done to save or to obtain it.               410
19005,ACT II.,
19006,ACT II.,_Stral._ You have harped the very string next to my heart[185].
19007,ACT II.,I may depend upon you?
19008,ACT II.,
19009,ACT II.,_Ulr._                'Twere too late
19010,ACT II.,To doubt it.
19011,ACT II.,
19012,ACT II.,_Stral._ Let no foolish pity shake
19013,ACT II.,Your bosom (for the appearance of the man
19014,ACT II.,"Is pitiful)--he is a wretch, as likely"
19015,ACT II.,"To have robbed me as the fellow more suspected,"
19016,ACT II.,Except that circumstance is less against him;
19017,ACT II.,"He being lodged far off, and in a chamber"
19018,ACT II.,"Without approach to mine; and, to say truth,"
19019,ACT II.,"I think too well of blood allied to mine,                          420"
19020,ACT II.,To deem he would descend to such an act:
19021,ACT II.,"Besides, he was a soldier, and a brave one"
19022,ACT II.,Once--though too rash.
19023,ACT II.,
19024,ACT II.,"_Ulr._                And they, my Lord, we know"
19025,ACT II.,"By our experience, never plunder till"
19026,ACT II.,"They knock the brains out first--which makes them heirs,"
19027,ACT II.,"Not thieves. The dead, who feel nought, can lose nothing,"
19028,ACT II.,Nor e'er be robbed: their spoils are a bequest--
19029,ACT II.,No more.
19030,ACT II.,
19031,ACT II.,_Stral._ Go to! you are a wag. But say
19032,ACT II.,"I may be sure you'll keep an eye on this man,"
19033,ACT II.,And let me know his slightest movement towards                     430
19034,ACT II.,Concealment or escape.
19035,ACT II.,
19036,ACT II.,_Ulr._                You may be sure
19037,ACT II.,You yourself could not watch him more than I
19038,ACT II.,Will be his sentinel.
19039,ACT II.,
19040,ACT II.,_Stral._             By this you make me
19041,ACT II.,"Yours, and for ever."
19042,ACT II.,
19043,ACT II.,_Ulr._               Such is my intention.                  [_Exeunt_.

19051,ACT III.,secret Passage leads_.
19052,ACT III.,
19053,ACT III.,_Enter_ WERNER _and_ GABOR.
19054,ACT III.,
19055,ACT III.,"_Gab._ Sir, I have told my tale: if it so please you"
19056,ACT III.,"To give me refuge for a few hours, well--"
19057,ACT III.,"If not, I'll try my fortune elsewhere."
19058,ACT III.,
19059,ACT III.,_Wer._                                 How
19060,ACT III.,"Can I, so wretched, give to Misery"
19061,ACT III.,A shelter?--wanting such myself as much
19062,ACT III.,As e'er the hunted deer a covert----
19063,ACT III.,
19064,ACT III.,_Gab._                               Or
19065,ACT III.,The wounded lion his cool cave. Methinks
19066,ACT III.,"You rather look like one would turn at bay,"
19067,ACT III.,And rip the hunter's entrails.
19068,ACT III.,
19069,ACT III.,_Wer._                         Ah!
19070,ACT III.,
19071,ACT III.,_Gab._                            I care not
19072,ACT III.,"If it be so, being much disposed to do                              10"
19073,ACT III.,The same myself. But will you shelter me?
19074,ACT III.,I am oppressed like you--and poor like you--
19075,ACT III.,Disgraced----
19076,ACT III.,
19077,ACT III.,_Wer._ (_abruptly_). Who told you that I was disgraced?
19078,ACT III.,
19079,ACT III.,_Gab._ No one; nor did I say _you_ were so: with
19080,ACT III.,Your poverty my likeness ended; but
19081,ACT III.,"I said _I_ was so--and would add, with truth,"
19082,ACT III.,As undeservedly as _you_.
19083,ACT III.,
19084,ACT III.,_Wer._                    Again!
19085,ACT III.,As _I_?
19086,ACT III.,
19087,ACT III.,_Gab._ Or any other honest man.
19088,ACT III.,What the devil would you have? You don't believe me
19089,ACT III.,Guilty of this base theft?
19090,ACT III.,
19091,ACT III.,"_Wer._                     No, no--I cannot.                        20"
19092,ACT III.,
19093,ACT III.,_Gab._ Why that's my heart of honour! yon young gallant--
19094,ACT III.,Your miserly Intendant and dense noble--
19095,ACT III.,All--all suspected me; and why? because
19096,ACT III.,"I am the worst clothed, and least named amongst them;"
19097,ACT III.,"Although, were Momus'[186] lattice in your breasts,"
19098,ACT III.,My soul might brook to open it more widely
19099,ACT III.,Than theirs: but thus it is--you poor and helpless--
19100,ACT III.,Both still more than myself.
19101,ACT III.,
19102,ACT III.,_Wer._                      How know you that?
19103,ACT III.,
19104,ACT III.,_Gab._ You're right: I ask for shelter at the hand
19105,ACT III.,"Which I call helpless; if you now deny it,                          30"
19106,ACT III.,"I were well paid. But you, who seem to have proved"
19107,ACT III.,"The wholesome bitterness of life, know well,"
19108,ACT III.,"By sympathy, that all the outspread gold"
19109,ACT III.,Of the New World the Spaniard boasts about
19110,ACT III.,"Could never tempt the man who knows its worth,"
19111,ACT III.,"Weighed at its proper value in the balance,"
19112,ACT III.,"Save in such guise (and there I grant its power,"
19113,ACT III.,"Because I feel it,) as may leave no nightmare"
19114,ACT III.,Upon his heart o' nights.
19115,ACT III.,
19116,ACT III.,_Wer._                    What do you mean?
19117,ACT III.,
19118,ACT III.,_Gab._ Just what I say; I thought my speech was plain:              40
19119,ACT III.,"You are no thief--nor I--and, as true men,"
19120,ACT III.,Should aid each other.
19121,ACT III.,
19122,ACT III.,"_Wer._                 It is a damned world, sir."
19123,ACT III.,
19124,ACT III.,"_Gab._ So is the nearest of the two next, as"
19125,ACT III.,"The priests say (and no doubt they should know best),"
19126,ACT III.,Therefore I'll stick by this--as being both
19127,ACT III.,"To suffer martyrdom, at least with such"
19128,ACT III.,An epitaph as larceny upon my tomb.
19129,ACT III.,It is but a night's lodging which I crave;
19130,ACT III.,"To-morrow I will try the waters, as"
19131,ACT III.,The dove did--trusting that they have abated.                       50
19132,ACT III.,
19133,ACT III.,_Wer._ Abated? Is there hope of that?
19134,ACT III.,
19135,ACT III.,_Gab._                                There was
19136,ACT III.,At noontide.
19137,ACT III.,
19138,ACT III.,_Wer._       Then we may be safe.
19139,ACT III.,
19140,ACT III.,_Gab._                           Are _you_
19141,ACT III.,In peril?
19142,ACT III.,
19143,ACT III.,_Wer._    Poverty is ever so.
19144,ACT III.,
19145,ACT III.,_Gab._ That I know by long practice. Will you not
19146,ACT III.,Promise to make mine less?
19147,ACT III.,
19148,ACT III.,_Wer._                     Your poverty?
19149,ACT III.,
19150,ACT III.,_Gab._ No--you don't look a leech for that disorder;
19151,ACT III.,"I meant my peril only: you've a roof,"
19152,ACT III.,And I have none; I merely seek a covert.
19153,ACT III.,
19154,ACT III.,_Wer._ Rightly; for how should such a wretch as I
19155,ACT III.,Have gold?
19156,ACT III.,
19157,ACT III.,"_Gab._    Scarce honestly, to say the truth on't,                   60"
19158,ACT III.,Although I almost wish you had the Baron's.
19159,ACT III.,
19160,ACT III.,_Wer._ Dare you insinuate?
19161,ACT III.,
19162,ACT III.,_Gab._                     What?
19163,ACT III.,
19164,ACT III.,_Wer._                          Are you aware
19165,ACT III.,To whom you speak?
19166,ACT III.,
19167,ACT III.,_Gab._             No; and I am not used
19168,ACT III.,Greatly to care. (_A noise heard without_.) But hark! they come!
19169,ACT III.,
19170,ACT III.,_Wer._                                                  Who come?
19171,ACT III.,
19172,ACT III.,_Gab._ The Intendant and his man-hounds after me:
19173,ACT III.,I'd face them--but it were in vain to expect
19174,ACT III.,Justice at hands like theirs. Where shall I go?
19175,ACT III.,"But show me any place. I do assure you,"
19176,ACT III.,"If there be faith in man, I am most guiltless:"
19177,ACT III.,Think if it were your own case!
19178,ACT III.,
19179,ACT III.,"_Wer._ (_aside_).              Oh, just God!                        70"
19180,ACT III.,Thy hell is not hereafter! Am I dust still?
19181,ACT III.,
19182,ACT III.,_Gab._ I see you're moved; and it shows well in you:
19183,ACT III.,I may live to requite it.
19184,ACT III.,
19185,ACT III.,_Wer._                    Are you not
19186,ACT III.,A spy of Stralenheim's?
19187,ACT III.,
19188,ACT III.,_Gab._                   Not I! and if
19189,ACT III.,"I were, what is there to espy in you?"
19190,ACT III.,"Although, I recollect, his frequent question"
19191,ACT III.,About you and your spouse might lead to some
19192,ACT III.,Suspicion; but you best know--what--and why.
19193,ACT III.,I am his deadliest foe.
19194,ACT III.,
19195,ACT III.,_Wer._                   _You?_
19196,ACT III.,
19197,ACT III.,_Gab._                         After such
19198,ACT III.,A treatment for the service which in part                           80
19199,ACT III.,"I rendered him, I am his enemy:"
19200,ACT III.,If you are not his friend you will assist me.
19201,ACT III.,
19202,ACT III.,_Wer._ I will.
19203,ACT III.,
19204,ACT III.,_Gab._         But how?
19205,ACT III.,
19206,ACT III.,_Wer._ (_showing the panel_). There is a secret spring:
19207,ACT III.,"Remember, I discovered it by chance,"
19208,ACT III.,And used it but for safety.
19209,ACT III.,
19210,ACT III.,"_Gab._                     Open it,"
19211,ACT III.,And I will use it for the same.
19212,ACT III.,
19213,ACT III.,"_Wer._                          I found it,"
19214,ACT III.,"As I have said: it leads through winding walls,"
19215,ACT III.,"(So thick as to bear paths within their ribs,"
19216,ACT III.,"Yet lose no jot of strength or stateliness,)"
19217,ACT III.,"And hollow cells, and obscure niches, to                            90"
19218,ACT III.,I know not whither; you must not advance:
19219,ACT III.,Give me your word.
19220,ACT III.,
19221,ACT III.,_Gab._             It is unecessary:
19222,ACT III.,How should I make my way in darkness through
19223,ACT III.,A Gothic labyrinth of unknown windings?
19224,ACT III.,
19225,ACT III.,"_Wer._ Yes, but who knows to what place it may lead?"
19226,ACT III.,_I_ know not--(mark you!)--but who knows it might not
19227,ACT III.,Lead even into the chamber of your foe?
19228,ACT III.,So strangely were contrived these galleries
19229,ACT III.,"By our Teutonic fathers in old days,"
19230,ACT III.,When man built less against the elements                           100
19231,ACT III.,Than his next neighbour. You must not advance
19232,ACT III.,Beyond the two first windings; if you do
19233,ACT III.,"(Albeit I never passed them,) I'll not answer"
19234,ACT III.,For what you may be led to.
19235,ACT III.,
19236,ACT III.,_Gab._                      But I will.
19237,ACT III.,A thousand thanks!
19238,ACT III.,
19239,ACT III.,_Wer._             You'll find the spring more obvious
19240,ACT III.,"On the other side; and, when you would return,"
19241,ACT III.,It yields to the least touch.
19242,ACT III.,
19243,ACT III.,_Gab._                        I'll in--farewell!
19244,ACT III.,[GABOR _goes in by the secret panel_.
19245,ACT III.,
19246,ACT III.,_Wer._ (_solus_). What have I done? Alas! what _had_ I done
19247,ACT III.,Before to make this fearful? Let it be
19248,ACT III.,"Still some atonement that I save the man,                          110"
19249,ACT III.,Whose sacrifice had saved perhaps my own--
19250,ACT III.,They come! to seek elsewhere what is before them!
19251,ACT III.,
19252,ACT III.,_Enter_ IDENSTEIN _and Others_.
19253,ACT III.,
19254,ACT III.,_Iden._ Is he not here? He must have vanished then
19255,ACT III.,Through the dim Gothic glass by pious aid
19256,ACT III.,Of pictured saints upon the red and yellow
19257,ACT III.,"Casements, through which the sunset streams like sunrise"
19258,ACT III.,On long pearl-coloured beards and crimson crosses.
19259,ACT III.,"And gilded crosiers, and crossed arms, and cowls,"
19260,ACT III.,"And helms, and twisted armour, and long swords,"
19261,ACT III.,All the fantastic furniture of windows                             120
19262,ACT III.,"Dim with brave knights and holy hermits, whose"
19263,ACT III.,Likeness and fame alike rest in some panes
19264,ACT III.,"Of crystal, which each rattling wind proclaims"
19265,ACT III.,As frail as any other life or glory.
19266,ACT III.,"He's gone, however."
19267,ACT III.,
19268,ACT III.,_Wer._              Whom do you seek?
19269,ACT III.,
19270,ACT III.,_Iden._                              A villain.
19271,ACT III.,
19272,ACT III.,"_Wer._ Why need you come so far, then?"
19273,ACT III.,
19274,ACT III.,_Iden._                               In the search
19275,ACT III.,Of him who robbed the Baron.
19276,ACT III.,
19277,ACT III.,_Wer._                       Are you sure
19278,ACT III.,You have divined the man?
19279,ACT III.,
19280,ACT III.,_Iden._                   As sure as you
19281,ACT III.,Stand there: but where's he gone?
19282,ACT III.,
19283,ACT III.,_Wer._                            Who?
19284,ACT III.,
19285,ACT III.,_Iden._                               He we sought.
19286,ACT III.,
19287,ACT III.,_Wer._ You see he is not here.
19288,ACT III.,
19289,ACT III.,_Iden._                        And yet we traced him               130
19290,ACT III.,Up to this hall. Are you accomplices?
19291,ACT III.,Or deal you in the black art?
19292,ACT III.,
19293,ACT III.,"_Wer._                        I deal plainly,"
19294,ACT III.,To many men the blackest.
19295,ACT III.,
19296,ACT III.,_Iden._                   It may be
19297,ACT III.,I have a question or two for yourself
19298,ACT III.,Hereafter; but we must continue now
19299,ACT III.,Our search for t'other.
19300,ACT III.,
19301,ACT III.,_Wer._                  You had best begin
19302,ACT III.,Your inquisition now: I may not be
19303,ACT III.,So patient always.
19304,ACT III.,
19305,ACT III.,"_Iden._            I should like to know,"
19306,ACT III.,"In good sooth, if you really are the man"
19307,ACT III.,That Stralenheim's in quest of.
19308,ACT III.,
19309,ACT III.,_Wer._                          Insolent!                          140
19310,ACT III.,Said you not that he was not here?
19311,ACT III.,
19312,ACT III.,"_Iden._                           Yes, _one_;"
19313,ACT III.,"But there's another whom he tracks more keenly,"
19314,ACT III.,"And soon, it may be, with authority"
19315,ACT III.,Both paramount to his and mine. But come!
19316,ACT III.,"Bustle, my boys! we are at fault."
19317,ACT III.,[_Exit_ IDENSTEIN _and Attendants_.

19319,ACT III.,_Wer._                            In what
19320,ACT III.,A maze hath my dim destiny involved me!
19321,ACT III.,And one base sin hath done me less ill than
19322,ACT III.,"The leaving undone one far greater. Down,"
19323,ACT III.,"Thou busy devil, rising in my heart!"
19324,ACT III.,Thou art too late! I'll nought to do with blood.                   150
19325,ACT III.,
19326,ACT III.,_Enter_ ULRIC.
19327,ACT III.,
19328,ACT III.,"_Ulr._ I sought you, father."
19329,ACT III.,
19330,ACT III.,_Wer._                       Is't not dangerous?
19331,ACT III.,
19332,ACT III.,_Ulr._ No; Stralenheim is ignorant of all
19333,ACT III.,Or any of the ties between us: more--
19334,ACT III.,"He sends me here a spy upon your actions,"
19335,ACT III.,Deeming me wholly his.
19336,ACT III.,
19337,ACT III.,_Wer._                 I cannot think it:
19338,ACT III.,"'Tis but a snare he winds about us both,"
19339,ACT III.,To swoop the sire and son at once.
19340,ACT III.,
19341,ACT III.,_Ulr._                             I cannot
19342,ACT III.,"Pause in each petty fear, and stumble at"
19343,ACT III.,"The doubts that rise like briers in our path,"
19344,ACT III.,"But must break through them, as an unarmed carle                   160"
19345,ACT III.,"Would, though with naked limbs, were the wolf rustling"
19346,ACT III.,In the same thicket where he hewed for bread.
19347,ACT III.,"Nets are for thrushes, eagles are not caught so:"
19348,ACT III.,We'll overfly or rend them.
19349,ACT III.,
19350,ACT III.,_Wer._                      Show me _how?_
19351,ACT III.,
19352,ACT III.,_Ulr._ Can you not guess?
19353,ACT III.,
19354,ACT III.,_Wer._                    I cannot.
19355,ACT III.,
19356,ACT III.,_Ulr._                            That is strange.
19357,ACT III.,Came the thought ne'er into your mind _last night_?
19358,ACT III.,
19359,ACT III.,_Wer._ I understand you not.
19360,ACT III.,
19361,ACT III.,_Ulr._                      Then we shall never
19362,ACT III.,More understand each other. But to change
19363,ACT III.,The topic----
19364,ACT III.,
19365,ACT III.,"_Wer._        You mean to _pursue_ it, as"
19366,ACT III.,'Tis of our safety.
19367,ACT III.,
19368,ACT III.,_Ulr._              Right; I stand corrected.                      170
19369,ACT III.,"I see the subject now more clearly, and"
19370,ACT III.,Our general situation in its bearings.
19371,ACT III.,The waters are abating; a few hours
19372,ACT III.,"Will bring his summoned myrmidons from Frankfort,"
19373,ACT III.,"When you will be a prisoner, perhaps worse,"
19374,ACT III.,"And I an outcast, bastardised by practice"
19375,ACT III.,Of this same Baron to make way for him.
19376,ACT III.,
19377,ACT III.,_Wer._ And now your remedy! I thought to escape
19378,ACT III.,By means of this accurséd gold; but now
19379,ACT III.,"I dare not use it, show it, scarce look on it.                     180"
19380,ACT III.,Methinks it wears upon its face my guilt
19381,ACT III.,"For motto, not the mintage of the state;"
19382,ACT III.,"And, for the sovereign's head, my own begirt"
19383,ACT III.,"With hissing snakes, which curl around my temples,"
19384,ACT III.,"And cry to all beholders, Lo! a villain!"
19385,ACT III.,
19386,ACT III.,"_Ulr._ You must not use it, at least now; but take"
19387,ACT III.,This ring.                               [_He gives_ WERNER _a jewel_.
19388,ACT III.,
19389,ACT III.,_Wer._     A gem! It was my father's!
19390,ACT III.,
19391,ACT III.,_Ulr._                               And
19392,ACT III.,As such is now your own. With this you must
19393,ACT III.,Bribe the Intendant for his old caleche
19394,ACT III.,"And horses to pursue your route at sunrise,                        190"
19395,ACT III.,Together with my mother.
19396,ACT III.,
19397,ACT III.,"_Wer._                   And leave you,"
19398,ACT III.,"So lately found, in peril too?"
19399,ACT III.,
19400,ACT III.,_Ulr._                         Fear nothing!
19401,ACT III.,"The only fear were if we fled together,"
19402,ACT III.,For that would make our ties beyond all doubt.
19403,ACT III.,The waters only lie in flood between
19404,ACT III.,This burgh and Frankfort: so far's in our favour
19405,ACT III.,"The route on to Bohemia, though encumbered,"
19406,ACT III.,Is not impassable; and when you gain
19407,ACT III.,"A few hours' start, the difficulties will be"
19408,ACT III.,The same to your pursuers. Once beyond                             200
19409,ACT III.,"The frontier, and you're safe."
19410,ACT III.,
19411,ACT III.,_Wer._                         My noble boy!
19412,ACT III.,
19413,ACT III.,_Ulr._ Hush! hush! no transports: we'll indulge in them
19414,ACT III.,In Castle Siegendorf! Display no gold:
19415,ACT III.,"Show Idenstein the gem (I know the man,"
19416,ACT III.,And have looked through him): it will answer thus
19417,ACT III.,A double purpose. Stralenheim lost _gold_--
19418,ACT III.,_No_ jewel: therefore it could _not_ be his;
19419,ACT III.,And then the man who was possest of this
19420,ACT III.,Can hardly be suspected of abstracting
19421,ACT III.,"The Baron's coin, when he could thus convert                       210"
19422,ACT III.,This ring to more than Stralenheim has lost
19423,ACT III.,By his last night's slumber. Be not over timid
19424,ACT III.,"In your address, nor yet too arrogant,"
19425,ACT III.,And Idenstein will serve you.
19426,ACT III.,
19427,ACT III.,_Wer._                        I will follow
19428,ACT III.,In all things your direction.
19429,ACT III.,
19430,ACT III.,_Ulr._                       I would have
19431,ACT III.,Spared you the trouble; but had I appeared
19432,ACT III.,"To take an interest in you, and still more"
19433,ACT III.,"By dabbling with a jewel in your favour,"
19434,ACT III.,All had been known at once.
19435,ACT III.,
19436,ACT III.,_Wer._                      My guardian angel!
19437,ACT III.,This overpays the past. But how wilt thou                          220
19438,ACT III.,Fare in our absence?
19439,ACT III.,
19440,ACT III.,_Ulr._                Stralenheim knows nothing
19441,ACT III.,Of me as aught of kindred with yourself.
19442,ACT III.,I will but wait a day or two with him
19443,ACT III.,"To lull all doubts, and then rejoin my father."
19444,ACT III.,
19445,ACT III.,_Wer._ To part no more!
19446,ACT III.,
19447,ACT III.,_Ulr._                  I know not that; but at
19448,ACT III.,The least we'll meet again once more.
19449,ACT III.,
19450,ACT III.,_Wer._                                My boy!
19451,ACT III.,"My friend! my only child, and sole preserver!"
19452,ACT III.,"Oh, do not hate me!"
19453,ACT III.,
19454,ACT III.,_Ulr._             Hate my father!
19455,ACT III.,
19456,ACT III.,"_Wer._                            Aye,"
19457,ACT III.,My father hated me. Why not my son?
19458,ACT III.,
19459,ACT III.,_Ulr._ Your father knew you not as I do.
19460,ACT III.,
19461,ACT III.,_Wer._                                   Scorpions                 230
19462,ACT III.,Are in thy words! Thou know me? in this guise
19463,ACT III.,"Thou canst not know me, I am not myself;"
19464,ACT III.,Yet (hate me not) I will be soon.
19465,ACT III.,
19466,ACT III.,_Ulr._                            I'll _wait!_
19467,ACT III.,In the mean time be sure that all a son
19468,ACT III.,Can do for parents shall be done for mine.
19469,ACT III.,
19470,ACT III.,"_Wer._ I see it, and I feel it; yet I feel"
19471,ACT III.,Further--that you despise me.
19472,ACT III.,
19473,ACT III.,_Ulr._                        Wherefore should I?
19474,ACT III.,
19475,ACT III.,_Wer._ Must I repeat my humiliation?
19476,ACT III.,
19477,ACT III.,_Ulr._                                No!
19478,ACT III.,I have fathomed it and you. But let us talk
19479,ACT III.,"Of this no more. Or, if it must be ever,                           240"
19480,ACT III.,Not _now_. Your error has redoubled all
19481,ACT III.,The present difficulties of our house
19482,ACT III.,At secret war with that of Stralenheim:
19483,ACT III.,All we have now to think of is to baffle
19484,ACT III.,HIM. I have shown _one_ way.
19485,ACT III.,
19486,ACT III.,"_Wer._                      The only one,"
19487,ACT III.,"And I embrace it, as I did my son,"
19488,ACT III.,Who showed _himself_ and father's _safety_ in
19489,ACT III.,One day.
19490,ACT III.,
19491,ACT III.,_Ulr._   You _shall_ be safe; let that suffice.
19492,ACT III.,Would Stralenheim's appearance in Bohemia
19493,ACT III.,"Disturb your right, or mine, if once we were                       250"
19494,ACT III.,Admitted to our lands?
19495,ACT III.,
19496,ACT III.,"_Wer._                  Assuredly,"
19497,ACT III.,Situate as we are now; although the first
19498,ACT III.,"Possessor might, as usual, prove the strongest--"
19499,ACT III.,Especially the next in blood.
19500,ACT III.,
19501,ACT III.,_Ulr._                        _Blood_! 'tis
19502,ACT III.,"A word of many meanings; in the veins,"
19503,ACT III.,"And out of them, it is a different thing--"
19504,ACT III.,"And so it should be, when the same in blood"
19505,ACT III.,"(As it is called) are aliens to each other,"
19506,ACT III.,"Like Theban brethren:[187] when a part is bad,"
19507,ACT III.,A few spilt ounces purify the rest.                                260
19508,ACT III.,
19509,ACT III.,_Wer._ I do not apprehend you.
19510,ACT III.,
19511,ACT III.,_Ulr._                         That may be--
19512,ACT III.,"And should, perhaps--and yet--but get ye ready;"
19513,ACT III.,You and my mother must away to-night.
19514,ACT III.,Here comes the Intendant: sound him with the gem;
19515,ACT III.,'Twill sink into his venal soul like lead
19516,ACT III.,"Into the deep, and bring up slime and mud,"
19517,ACT III.,"And ooze, too, from the bottom, as the lead doth"
19518,ACT III.,With its greased understratum;[188] but no less
19519,ACT III.,Will serve to warn our vessels through these shoals.
19520,ACT III.,"The freight is rich, so heave the line in time!                    270"
19521,ACT III.,"Farewell! I scarce have time, but yet your _hand_,"
19522,ACT III.,My father!----
19523,ACT III.,
19524,ACT III.,_Wer._         Let me embrace thee!
19525,ACT III.,
19526,ACT III.,_Ulr._                             We may be
19527,ACT III.,Observed: subdue your nature to the hour!
19528,ACT III.,Keep off from me as from your foe!
19529,ACT III.,
19530,ACT III.,_Wer._                            Accursed
19531,ACT III.,Be he who is the stifling cause which smothers
19532,ACT III.,The best and sweetest feeling of our hearts;
19533,ACT III.,At such an hour too!
19534,ACT III.,
19535,ACT III.,"_Ulr._              Yes, curse--it will ease you!"
19536,ACT III.,Here is the Intendant.
19537,ACT III.,
19538,ACT III.,_Enter_ IDENSTEIN.
19539,ACT III.,
19540,ACT III.,"_Ulr._                 Master Idenstein,"
19541,ACT III.,How fare you in your purpose? Have you caught
19542,ACT III.,The rogue?
19543,ACT III.,
19544,ACT III.,"_Iden._     No, faith!"
19545,ACT III.,
19546,ACT III.,"_Ulr._                Well, there are plenty more:                 280"
19547,ACT III.,You may have better luck another chase.
19548,ACT III.,Where is the Baron?
19549,ACT III.,
19550,ACT III.,_Iden._             Gone back to his chamber:
19551,ACT III.,"And now I think on't, asking after you"
19552,ACT III.,With nobly-born impatience.
19553,ACT III.,
19554,ACT III.,_Ulr._                     Your great men
19555,ACT III.,"Must be answered on the instant, as the bound"
19556,ACT III.,Of the stung steed replies unto the spur:
19557,ACT III.,"'Tis well they have horses, too; for if they had not,"
19558,ACT III.,"I fear that men must draw their chariots, as"
19559,ACT III.,They say kings did Sesostris[189].
19560,ACT III.,
19561,ACT III.,_Iden._                        Who was he?
19562,ACT III.,
19563,ACT III.,_Ulr._ An old Bohemian--an imperial gipsy.                         290
19564,ACT III.,
19565,ACT III.,"_Iden._ A gipsy or Bohemian, 'tis the same,"
19566,ACT III.,For they pass by both names. And was he one?
19567,ACT III.,
19568,ACT III.,"_Ulr._ I've heard so; but I must take leave. Intendant,"
19569,ACT III.,"Your servant!--Werner (_to_ WERNER _slightly_), if that be your name,"
19570,ACT III.,Yours.                                                  [_Exit_ ULRIC.
19571,ACT III.,
19572,ACT III.,"_Iden._ A well-spoken, pretty-faced young man!"
19573,ACT III.,"And prettily behaved! He knows his station,"
19574,ACT III.,"You see, sir: how he gave to each his due"
19575,ACT III.,Precedence!
19576,ACT III.,
19577,ACT III.,"_Wer._      I perceived it, and applaud"
19578,ACT III.,His just discernment and your own.
19579,ACT III.,
19580,ACT III.,_Iden._                            That's well--
19581,ACT III.,"That's very well. You also know your place, too;                   300"
19582,ACT III.,And yet I don't know that _I_ know your place.
19583,ACT III.,
19584,ACT III.,_Wer._ (_showing the ring_).
19585,ACT III.,Would this assist your knowledge?
19586,ACT III.,
19587,ACT III.,_Iden._                           How!--What!--Eh!
19588,ACT III.,A jewel!
19589,ACT III.,
19590,ACT III.,_Wer._   'Tis your own on one condition.
19591,ACT III.,
19592,ACT III.,_Iden._ Mine!--Name it!
19593,ACT III.,
19594,ACT III.,_Wer._                  That hereafter you permit me
19595,ACT III.,At thrice its value to redeem it: 'tis
19596,ACT III.,A family ring.
19597,ACT III.,
19598,ACT III.,_Iden._        A family!--_yours!_--a gem!
19599,ACT III.,I'm breathless!
19600,ACT III.,
19601,ACT III.,"_Wer._          You must also furnish me,"
19602,ACT III.,"An hour ere daybreak, with all means to quit"
19603,ACT III.,This place.
19604,ACT III.,
19605,ACT III.,_Iden._      But is it real? Let me look on it:
19606,ACT III.,"_Diamond_, by all that's glorious!"
19607,ACT III.,
19608,ACT III.,"_Wer._                             Come, I'll trust you:           310"
19609,ACT III.,"You have guessed, no doubt, that I was born above"
19610,ACT III.,My present seeming.
19611,ACT III.,
19612,ACT III.,"_Iden._            I can't say I did,"
19613,ACT III.,Though this looks like it: this is the true breeding
19614,ACT III.,Of gentle blood!
19615,ACT III.,
19616,ACT III.,_Wer._           I have important reasons
19617,ACT III.,For wishing to continue privily
19618,ACT III.,My journey hence.
19619,ACT III.,
19620,ACT III.,_Iden._           So then _you are_ the man
19621,ACT III.,Whom Stralenheim's in quest of?
19622,ACT III.,
19623,ACT III.,_Wer._                          I am not;
19624,ACT III.,But being taken for him might conduct
19625,ACT III.,"So much embarrassment to me just now,"
19626,ACT III.,And to the Baron's self hereafter--'tis                            320
19627,ACT III.,To spare both that I would avoid all bustle.
19628,ACT III.,
19629,ACT III.,"_Iden._ Be you the man or no, 'tis not my business;"
19630,ACT III.,"Besides, I never could obtain the half"
19631,ACT III.,"From this proud, niggardly noble, who would raise"
19632,ACT III.,"The country for some missing bits of coin,"
19633,ACT III.,And never offer a precise reward--[ct]
19634,ACT III.,But _this!_--another look!
19635,ACT III.,
19636,ACT III.,_Wer._                     Gaze on it freely;
19637,ACT III.,At day-dawn it is yours.
19638,ACT III.,
19639,ACT III.,"_Iden._                  Oh, thou sweet sparkler!"
19640,ACT III.,Thou more than stone of the philosopher!
19641,ACT III.,Thou touch-stone of Philosophy herself!                            330
19642,ACT III.,Thou bright eye of the Mine! thou loadstar of
19643,ACT III.,The soul! the true magnetic Pole to which
19644,ACT III.,"All hearts point duly north, like trembling needles!"
19645,ACT III.,"Thou flaming Spirit of the Earth! which, sitting"
19646,ACT III.,"High on the Monarch's Diadem, attractest"
19647,ACT III.,More worship than the majesty who sweats
19648,ACT III.,"Beneath the crown which makes his head ache, like"
19649,ACT III.,Millions of hearts which bleed to lend it lustre!

19658,ACT III.,
19659,ACT III.,_Iden._ I do believe in thee! thou art the spirit
19660,ACT III.,Of whom I long have dreamed in a low garb.--
19661,ACT III.,"But come, I'll serve thee; thou shalt be as free"

19679,ACT III.,"_Stral._                            I am not sleepy,"
19680,ACT III.,And yet I must to bed: I fain would say
19681,ACT III.,"To rest, but something heavy on my spirit,"
19682,ACT III.,"Too dull for wakefulness, too quick for slumber,"
19683,ACT III.,"Sits on me as a cloud along the sky,"

19692,ACT III.,"_Stral._ I feel, and fear, I shall."
19693,ACT III.,
19694,ACT III.,_Fritz_.                            And wherefore fear?
19695,ACT III.,
19696,ACT III.,"_Stral._ I know not why, and therefore do fear more,"
19697,ACT III.,Because an undescribable----but 'tis
19698,ACT III.,All folly. Were the locks as I desired

19729,ACT III.,"Of outposts, on the never-merry clock,"
19730,ACT III.,"That hollow tongue[190] of time, which, even when"
19731,ACT III.,"It sounds for joy, takes something from enjoyment"
19732,ACT III.,"With every clang. 'Tis a perpetual knell,"
19733,ACT III.,Though for a marriage-feast it rings: each stroke
19734,ACT III.,Peals for a hope the less; the funeral note
19735,ACT III.,"Of Love deep-buried, without resurrection,"
19736,ACT III.,In the grave of Possession; while the knoll[191]                    10
19737,ACT III.,Of long-lived parents finds a jovial echo
19738,ACT III.,To triple time in the son's ear.
19739,ACT III.,I'm cold--
19740,ACT III.,I'm dark;--I've blown my fingers--numbered o'er
19741,ACT III.,And o'er my steps--and knocked my head against
19742,ACT III.,Some fifty buttresses--and roused the rats
19743,ACT III.,"And bats in general insurrection, till"

19745,ACT III.,Leave me scarce hearing for another sound.
19746,ACT III.,A light! It is at distance (if I can
19747,ACT III.,Measure in darkness distance): but it blinks                        20
19748,ACT III.,"As through a crevice or a key-hole, in"

19750,ACT III.,"Nevertheless, from curiosity."
19751,ACT III.,A distant lamp-light is an incident

19754,ACT III.,To obtain or to escape it! Shining still!
19755,ACT III.,"Were it the star of Lucifer himself,"
19756,ACT III.,"Or he himself girt with its beams, I could"
19757,ACT III.,Contain no longer. Softly: mighty well!                             30
19758,ACT III.,That corner's turned--so--ah! no;--right! it draws
19759,ACT III.,"Nearer. Here is a darksome angle--so,"
19760,ACT III.,That's weathered.--Let me pause.--Suppose it leads
19761,ACT III.,Into some greater danger than that which
19762,ACT III.,"I have escaped--no matter, 'tis a new one;"

19775,ACT III.,
19776,ACT III.,_Wer._ I could not sleep--and now the hour's at hand!
19777,ACT III.,All's ready. Idenstein has kept his word;
19778,ACT III.,"And stationed in the outskirts of the town,"
19779,ACT III.,"Upon the forest's edge, the vehicle"
19780,ACT III.,Awaits us. Now the dwindling stars begin
19781,ACT III.,To pale in heaven; and for the last time I
19782,ACT III.,"Look on these horrible walls. Oh! never, never"
19783,ACT III.,"Shall I forget them. Here I came most poor,"
19784,ACT III.,But not dishonoured: and I leave them with

19786,ACT III.,"My heart!--a never-dying canker-worm,"
19787,ACT III.,"Which all the coming splendour of the lands,"
19788,ACT III.,"And rights, and sovereignty of Siegendorf"
19789,ACT III.,Can scarcely lull a moment. I must find
19790,ACT III.,"Some means of restitution, which would ease"
19791,ACT III.,"My soul in part: but how, without discovery?--"
19792,ACT III.,"It must be done, however; and I'll pause"
19793,ACT III.,Upon the method the first hour of safety.
19794,ACT III.,The madness of my misery led to this
19795,ACT III.,Base infamy; repentance must retrieve it:                           20
19796,ACT III.,I will have nought of Stralenheim's upon
19797,ACT III.,"My spirit, though he would grasp all of mine;"

19800,ACT III.,"Spread for his canopy, o'er silken pillows,"
19801,ACT III.,Such as when----Hark! what noise is that? Again!
19802,ACT III.,The branches shake; and some loose stones have fallen
19803,ACT III.,From yonder terrace.
19804,ACT III.,[ULRIC _leaps down from the terrace_.

19815,ACT III.,
19816,ACT III.,_Wer._                   What?
19817,ACT III.,
19818,ACT III.,_Ulr._                        An assassin?
19819,ACT III.,

19830,ACT III.,
19831,ACT III.,_Wer._          I never was as yet
19832,ACT III.,The murderer of any man. What mean you?
19833,ACT III.,
19834,ACT III.,_Ulr._ Did not you _this_ night (as the night before)
19835,ACT III.,Retrace the secret passage? Did you not
19836,ACT III.,_Again_ revisit Stralenheim's chamber? and----
19837,ACT III.,[ULRIC _pauses_.
19838,ACT III.,
19839,ACT III.,_Wer._ Proceed.

19841,ACT III.,_Ulr._         _Died_ he not by your hand?
19842,ACT III.,
19843,ACT III.,_Wer._                                    Great God!                40

19848,ACT III.,
19849,ACT III.,"_Wer._        If I e'er, in heart or mind,"
19850,ACT III.,"Conceived deliberately such a thought,"
19851,ACT III.,But rather strove to trample back to hell
19852,ACT III.,Such thoughts--if e'er they glared a moment through
19853,ACT III.,The irritation of my oppressed spirit--
19854,ACT III.,"May Heaven be shut for ever from my hopes,"
19855,ACT III.,As from mine eyes!
19856,ACT III.,
19857,ACT III.,_Ulr._            But Stralenheim is dead.
19858,ACT III.,
19859,ACT III.,"_Wer._ 'Tis horrible! 'tis hideous, as 'tis hateful!--              50"
19860,ACT III.,But what have I to do with this?

19862,ACT III.,_Ulr._                           No bolt
19863,ACT III.,"Is forced; no violence can be detected,"
19864,ACT III.,Save on his body. Part of his own household
19865,ACT III.,Have been alarmed; but as the Intendant is
19866,ACT III.,"Absent, I took upon myself the care"
19867,ACT III.,"Of mustering the police. His chamber has,"
19868,ACT III.,"Past doubt, been entered secretly. Excuse me,"

19882,ACT III.,_Ulr._                                   Yet

19900,ACT III.,"Open, and the doors which lead from that hall"
19901,ACT III.,Which masks it: I but thought he had snatched the silent
19902,ACT III.,And favourable moment to escape
19903,ACT III.,"The myrmidons of Idenstein, who were"
19904,ACT III.,Dogging him yester-even.
19905,ACT III.,
19906,ACT III.,_Ulr._                  You reclosed
19907,ACT III.,The panel?

19909,ACT III.,_Wer._     Yes; and not without reproach
19910,ACT III.,(And inner trembling for the avoided peril)

19917,ACT III.,_Wer._ Certain.
19918,ACT III.,
19919,ACT III.,"_Ulr._         That's well; but had been better, if"

19926,ACT III.,"_Ulr._      No, father; do not speak of this:"

19931,ACT III.,_Wer._                          Could I shun it?
19932,ACT III.,A man pursued by my chief foe; disgraced
19933,ACT III.,"For my own crime: a victim to _my_ safety,"
19934,ACT III.,Imploring a few hours' concealment from                             90
19935,ACT III.,The very wretch who was the cause he needed
19936,ACT III.,"Such refuge. Had he been a wolf, I could not"
19937,ACT III.,Have in such circumstances thrust him forth.
19938,ACT III.,
19939,ACT III.,_Ulr._ And like the wolf he hath repaid you. But
19940,ACT III.,It is too late to ponder thus:--you must
19941,ACT III.,Set out ere dawn. I will remain here to
19942,ACT III.,"Trace the murderer, if 'tis possible."
19943,ACT III.,
19944,ACT III.,_Wer._ But this my sudden flight will give the Moloch

19952,ACT III.,"_Wer._     Not _I_, though just now you doubted--"

19957,ACT III.,
19958,ACT III.,_Wer._        Boy! since I fell into
19959,ACT III.,"The abyss of crime (though not of _such_ crime), I,"
19960,ACT III.,"Having seen the innocent oppressed for me,"
19961,ACT III.,May doubt even of the guilty's guilt. Your heart
19962,ACT III.,"Is free, and quick with virtuous wrath to accuse"
19963,ACT III.,Appearances; and views a criminal

19990,ACT III.,_Ulr._                I will provide against
19991,ACT III.,Aught that can touch you. No one knows you here
19992,ACT III.,As heir of Siegendorf: if Idenstein
19993,ACT III.,"Suspects, 'tis _but suspicion_, and he is"
19994,ACT III.,"A fool: his folly shall have such employment,                      130"
19995,ACT III.,"Too, that the unknown Werner shall give way"
19996,ACT III.,To nearer thoughts of self. The laws (if e'er
19997,ACT III.,Laws reached this village) are all in abeyance
19998,ACT III.,"With the late general war of thirty years,"
19999,ACT III.,"Or crushed, or rising slowly from the dust,"
20000,ACT III.,To which the march of armies trampled them.
20001,ACT III.,"Stralenheim, although noble, is unheeded"
20002,ACT III.,"_Here_, save as _such_--without lands, influence,"
20003,ACT III.,Save what hath perished with him. Few prolong
20004,ACT III.,A week beyond their funeral rites their sway                       140
20005,ACT III.,"O'er men, unless by relatives, whose interest"
20006,ACT III.,Is roused: such is not here the case; he died
20007,ACT III.,"Alone, unknown,--a solitary grave,"
20008,ACT III.,"Obscure as his deserts, without a scutcheon,"
20009,ACT III.,"Is all he'll have, or wants. If _I_ discover"
20010,ACT III.,"The assassin, 'twill be well--if not, believe me,"
20011,ACT III.,None else; though all the full-fed train of menials
20012,ACT III.,May howl above his ashes (as they did
20013,ACT III.,"Around him in his danger on the Oder),"
20014,ACT III.,Will no more stir a finger _now_ than _then_.                      150
20015,ACT III.,Hence! hence! I must not hear your answer.--Look!
20016,ACT III.,"The stars are almost faded, and the grey"
20017,ACT III.,Begins to grizzle the black hair of night.
20018,ACT III.,You shall not answer:--Pardon me that I
20019,ACT III.,"Am peremptory: 'tis your son that speaks,"
20020,ACT III.,"Your long-lost, late-found son.--Let's call my mother!"
20021,ACT III.,"Softly and swiftly step, and leave the rest"
20022,ACT III.,To me: I'll answer for the event as far
20023,ACT III.,"As regards _you_, and that is the chief point,"
20024,ACT III.,"As my first duty, which shall be observed.                         160"
20025,ACT III.,We'll meet in Castle Siegendorf--once more
20026,ACT III.,Our banners shall be glorious! Think of that
20027,ACT III.,"Alone, and leave all other thoughts to me,"
20028,ACT III.,Whose youth may better battle with them--Hence!
20029,ACT III.,And may your age be happy!--I will kiss
20030,ACT III.,"My mother once more, then Heaven's speed be with you!"
20031,ACT III.,
20032,ACT III.,_Wer._ This counsel's safe--but is it honourable?
20033,ACT III.,
20034,ACT III.,_Ulr._ To save a father is a child's chief honour.
20035,ACT III.,[_Exeunt_.

20043,ACT IV.,"SCENE I.--_A Gothic Hall in the Castle of Siegendorf, near Prague_."
20044,ACT IV.,
20045,ACT IV.,"_Enter_ ERIC _and_ HENRICK, _Retainers of the Count_."
20046,ACT IV.,
20047,ACT IV.,"_Eric_. So, better times are come at last; to these"
20048,ACT IV.,Old walls new masters and high wassail--both
20049,ACT IV.,A long desideratum.
20050,ACT IV.,
20051,ACT IV.,"_Hen._              Yes, for _masters_,"
20052,ACT IV.,"It might be unto those who long for novelty,"
20053,ACT IV.,"Though made by a new grave: but, as for wassail,"
20054,ACT IV.,Methinks the old Count Siegendorf maintained
20055,ACT IV.,His feudal hospitality as high
20056,ACT IV.,As e'er another Prince of the empire.
20057,ACT IV.,
20058,ACT IV.,_Eric_.                               Why
20059,ACT IV.,"For the mere cup and trencher, we no doubt"
20060,ACT IV.,Fared passing well; but as for merriment                            10
20061,ACT IV.,"And sport, without which salt and sauces season"
20062,ACT IV.,"The cheer but scantily, our sizings were"
20063,ACT IV.,Even of the narrowest.
20064,ACT IV.,
20065,ACT IV.,_Hen._                 The old count loved not
20066,ACT IV.,The roar of revel; are you sure that _this_ does?
20067,ACT IV.,
20068,ACT IV.,"_Eric_. As yet he hath been courteous as he's bounteous,"
20069,ACT IV.,And we all love him.
20070,ACT IV.,
20071,ACT IV.,_Hen._               His reign is as yet
20072,ACT IV.,"Hardly a year o'erpast its honeymoon,"
20073,ACT IV.,And the first year of sovereigns is bridal:
20074,ACT IV.,"Anon, we shall perceive his real sway"
20075,ACT IV.,And moods of mind.
20076,ACT IV.,
20077,ACT IV.,_Eric_.            Pray Heaven he keep the present!                 20
20078,ACT IV.,"Then his brave son, Count Ulric--there's a knight!"
20079,ACT IV.,Pity the wars are o'er!
20080,ACT IV.,
20081,ACT IV.,_Hen._                  Why so?
20082,ACT IV.,
20083,ACT IV.,_Eric_.                        Look on him!
20084,ACT IV.,And answer that yourself.
20085,ACT IV.,
20086,ACT IV.,"_Hen._                    He's very youthful,"
20087,ACT IV.,And strong and beautiful as a young tiger.
20088,ACT IV.,
20089,ACT IV.,_Eric_. That's not a faithful vassal's likeness.
20090,ACT IV.,
20091,ACT IV.,_Hen._                                           But
20092,ACT IV.,Perhaps a true one.
20093,ACT IV.,
20094,ACT IV.,"_Eric_.              Pity, as I said,"
20095,ACT IV.,"The wars are over: in the hall, who like"
20096,ACT IV.,"Count Ulric for a well-supported pride,"
20097,ACT IV.,"Which awes, but yet offends not? in the field,"
20098,ACT IV.,"Who like him with his spear in hand, when gnashing                  30"
20099,ACT IV.,"His tusks, and ripping up, from right to left,"
20100,ACT IV.,"The howling hounds, the boar makes for the thicket?"
20101,ACT IV.,"Who backs a horse, or bears a hawk, or wears"
20102,ACT IV.,A sword like him? Whose plume nods knightlier?
20103,ACT IV.,
20104,ACT IV.,"_Hen._ No one's, I grant you. Do not fear, if war"
20105,ACT IV.,"Be long in coming, he is of that kind"
20106,ACT IV.,"Will make it for himself, if he hath not"
20107,ACT IV.,Already done as much.
20108,ACT IV.,
20109,ACT IV.,_Eric_.               What do you mean?
20110,ACT IV.,
20111,ACT IV.,_Hen._ You can't deny his train of followers
20112,ACT IV.,(But few our native fellow-vassals born                             40
20113,ACT IV.,On the domain) are such a sort of knaves
20114,ACT IV.,As----                                                      [_Pauses_.
20115,ACT IV.,
20116,ACT IV.,_Eric_. What?
20117,ACT IV.,
20118,ACT IV.,_Hen._       The war (you love so much) leaves living.
20119,ACT IV.,"Like other parents, she spoils her worst children."
20120,ACT IV.,
20121,ACT IV.,"_Eric_. Nonsense! they are all brave iron-visaged fellows,"
20122,ACT IV.,Such as old Tilly loved.
20123,ACT IV.,
20124,ACT IV.,_Hen._                   And who loved Tilly?
20125,ACT IV.,"Ask that at Magdebourg[194]--or, for that matter,"
20126,ACT IV.,Wallenstein either;--they are gone to----
20127,ACT IV.,
20128,ACT IV.,_Eric_.                                   Rest!
20129,ACT IV.,But what beyond 'tis not ours to pronounce.
20130,ACT IV.,
20131,ACT IV.,_Hen._ I wish they had left us something of their rest:
20132,ACT IV.,The country (nominally now at peace)                                50
20133,ACT IV.,Is over-run with--God knows who: they fly
20134,ACT IV.,"By night, and disappear with sunrise; but"
20135,ACT IV.,"Leave us no less desolation, nay, even more,"
20136,ACT IV.,Than the most open warfare.
20137,ACT IV.,
20138,ACT IV.,_Eric_.                    But Count Ulric--
20139,ACT IV.,What has all this to do with him?
20140,ACT IV.,
20141,ACT IV.,_Hen._                            With him!
20142,ACT IV.,He----might prevent it. As you say he's fond
20143,ACT IV.,"Of war, why makes he it not on those marauders?"
20144,ACT IV.,
20145,ACT IV.,_Eric_. You'd better ask himself.
20146,ACT IV.,
20147,ACT IV.,_Hen._                            I would as soon
20148,ACT IV.,Ask the lion why he laps not milk.
20149,ACT IV.,
20150,ACT IV.,_Eric_. And here he comes!
20151,ACT IV.,
20152,ACT IV.,_Hen._                    The devil! you'll hold your tongue?       60
20153,ACT IV.,
20154,ACT IV.,_Eric_. Why do you turn so pale?
20155,ACT IV.,
20156,ACT IV.,_Hen._                          'Tis nothing--but
20157,ACT IV.,Be silent.
20158,ACT IV.,
20159,ACT IV.,"_Eric_.    I will, upon what you have said."
20160,ACT IV.,
20161,ACT IV.,"_Hen._ I assure you I meant nothing,--a mere sport"
20162,ACT IV.,"Of words, no more; besides, had it been otherwise,"
20163,ACT IV.,He is to espouse the gentle Baroness
20164,ACT IV.,"Ida of Stralenheim, the late Baron's heiress;"
20165,ACT IV.,"And she, no doubt, will soften whatsoever"
20166,ACT IV.,Of fierceness the late long intestine wars
20167,ACT IV.,"Have given all natures, and most unto those"
20168,ACT IV.,"Who were born in them, and bred up upon                             70"
20169,ACT IV.,"The knees of Homicide; sprinkled, as it were,"
20170,ACT IV.,"With blood even at their baptism. Prithee, peace"
20171,ACT IV.,On all that I have said!
20172,ACT IV.,
20173,ACT IV.,_Enter_ ULRIC _and_ RODOLPH.
20174,ACT IV.,
20175,ACT IV.,"Good morrow, count."
20176,ACT IV.,
20177,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ Good morrow, worthy Henrick. Eric, is"
20178,ACT IV.,All ready for the chase?
20179,ACT IV.,
20180,ACT IV.,_Eric_.                 The dogs are ordered
20181,ACT IV.,"Down to the forest, and the vassals out"
20182,ACT IV.,"To beat the bushes, and the day looks promising."
20183,ACT IV.,Shall I call forth your Excellency's suite?
20184,ACT IV.,What courser will you please to mount?
20185,ACT IV.,
20186,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                                 The dun,"
20187,ACT IV.,Walstein.
20188,ACT IV.,
20189,ACT IV.,_Eric_.   I fear he scarcely has recovered                          80
20190,ACT IV.,The toils of Monday: 'twas a noble chase:
20191,ACT IV.,You speared _four_ with your own hand.
20192,ACT IV.,
20193,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                                 True, good Eric;"
20194,ACT IV.,"I had forgotten--let it be the grey, then,"
20195,ACT IV.,Old Ziska: he has not been out this fortnight.
20196,ACT IV.,
20197,ACT IV.,_Eric_. He shall be straight caparisoned. How many
20198,ACT IV.,Of your immediate retainers shall
20199,ACT IV.,Escort you?
20200,ACT IV.,
20201,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._      I leave that to Weilburgh, our"
20202,ACT IV.,Master of the horse.                                     [_Exit_ ERIC.
20203,ACT IV.,Rodolph!
20204,ACT IV.,
20205,ACT IV.,_Rod._                      My Lord!
20206,ACT IV.,
20207,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                              The news
20208,ACT IV.,Is awkward from the----                  [RODOLPH _points to_ HENRICK.
20209,ACT IV.,"How now, Henrick? why"
20210,ACT IV.,Loiter you here?
20211,ACT IV.,
20212,ACT IV.,"_Hen._          For your commands, my Lord.                         90"
20213,ACT IV.,
20214,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ Go to my father, and present my duty,"
20215,ACT IV.,And learn if he would aught with me before
20216,ACT IV.,I mount.                                              [_Exit_ HENRICK.
20217,ACT IV.,"Rodolph, our friends have had a check"
20218,ACT IV.,"Upon the frontiers of Franconia[195], and"
20219,ACT IV.,'Tis rumoured that the column sent against them
20220,ACT IV.,Is to be strengthened. I must join them soon.
20221,ACT IV.,
20222,ACT IV.,_Rod._ Best wait for further and more sure advices.
20223,ACT IV.,
20224,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ I mean it--and indeed it could not well
20225,ACT IV.,Have fallen out at a time more opposite
20226,ACT IV.,To all my plans.
20227,ACT IV.,
20228,ACT IV.,_Rod._            It will be difficult                             100
20229,ACT IV.,To excuse your absence to the Count your father.
20230,ACT IV.,
20231,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ Yes, but the unsettled state of our domain"
20232,ACT IV.,In high Silesia will permit and cover
20233,ACT IV.,"My journey. In the mean time, when we are"
20234,ACT IV.,"Engaged in the chase, draw off the eighty men"
20235,ACT IV.,Whom Wolffe leads--keep the forests on your route:
20236,ACT IV.,You know it well?
20237,ACT IV.,
20238,ACT IV.,_Rod._           As well as on that night
20239,ACT IV.,When we----
20240,ACT IV.,
20241,ACT IV.,_Ulr._     We will not speak of that until
20242,ACT IV.,We can repeat the same with like success:
20243,ACT IV.,"And when you have joined, give Rosenberg this letter.              110"
20244,ACT IV.,[_Gives a letter_.
20245,ACT IV.,"Add further, that I have sent this slight addition"
20246,ACT IV.,"To our force with you and Wolffe, as herald of"
20247,ACT IV.,"My coming, though I could but spare them ill"
20248,ACT IV.,"At this time, as my father loves to keep"
20249,ACT IV.,"Full numbers of retainers round the castle,"
20250,ACT IV.,"Until this marriage, and its feasts and fooleries,"
20251,ACT IV.,Are rung out with its peal of nuptial nonsense.
20252,ACT IV.,
20253,ACT IV.,_Rod._ I thought you loved the lady Ida?
20254,ACT IV.,
20255,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                                   Why,"
20256,ACT IV.,I do so--but it follows not from that
20257,ACT IV.,"I would bind in my youth and glorious years,                       120"
20258,ACT IV.,"So brief and burning, with a lady's zone,"
20259,ACT IV.,"Although 'twere that of Venus:--but I love her,"
20260,ACT IV.,As woman should be loved--fairly and solely.
20261,ACT IV.,
20262,ACT IV.,_Rod._ And constantly?
20263,ACT IV.,
20264,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                 I think so; for I love
20265,ACT IV.,Nought else.--But I have not the time to pause
20266,ACT IV.,Upon these gewgaws of the heart. Great things
20267,ACT IV.,We have to do ere long. Speed! speed! good Rodolph!
20268,ACT IV.,
20269,ACT IV.,"_Rod._ On my return, however, I shall find"
20270,ACT IV.,The Baroness Ida lost in Countess Siegendorf?
20271,ACT IV.,
20272,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ Perhaps: my father wishes it, and, sooth,                   130"
20273,ACT IV.,'Tis no bad policy: this union with
20274,ACT IV.,The last bud of the rival branch at once
20275,ACT IV.,Unites the future and destroys the past.
20276,ACT IV.,
20277,ACT IV.,_Rod._ Adieu.
20278,ACT IV.,
20279,ACT IV.,_Ulr._        Yet hold--we had better keep together
20280,ACT IV.,"Until the chase begins; then draw thou off,"
20281,ACT IV.,And do as I have said.
20282,ACT IV.,
20283,ACT IV.,_Rod._                 I will. But to
20284,ACT IV.,Return--'twas a most kind act in the count
20285,ACT IV.,Your father to send up to Konigsberg
20286,ACT IV.,"For this fair orphan of the Baron, and"
20287,ACT IV.,To hail her as his daughter.
20288,ACT IV.,
20289,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                       Wondrous kind!                        140
20290,ACT IV.,Especially as little kindness till
20291,ACT IV.,Then grew between them.
20292,ACT IV.,
20293,ACT IV.,_Rod._                  The late Baron died
20294,ACT IV.,"Of a fever, did he not?"
20295,ACT IV.,
20296,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                 How should I know?
20297,ACT IV.,
20298,ACT IV.,_Rod._ I have heard it whispered there was something strange
20299,ACT IV.,About his death--and even the place of it
20300,ACT IV.,Is scarcely known.
20301,ACT IV.,
20302,ACT IV.,_Ulr._             Some obscure village on
20303,ACT IV.,The Saxon or Silesian frontier.
20304,ACT IV.,
20305,ACT IV.,_Rod._                           He
20306,ACT IV.,Has left no testament--no farewell words?
20307,ACT IV.,
20308,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ I am neither confessor nor notary,"
20309,ACT IV.,So cannot say.
20310,ACT IV.,
20311,ACT IV.,_Rod._         Ah! here's the lady Ida.                            150
20312,ACT IV.,
20313,ACT IV.,_Enter_ IDA STRALENHEIM.
20314,ACT IV.,
20315,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ You are early, my sweet cousin!"
20316,ACT IV.,
20317,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                                 Not _too_ early,"
20318,ACT IV.,"Dear Ulric, if I do not interrupt you."
20319,ACT IV.,"Why do you call me ""_Cousin?_"""
20320,ACT IV.,
20321,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ (_smiling_).            Are we not so?
20322,ACT IV.,
20323,ACT IV.,"_Ida._ Yes, but I do not like the name; methinks"
20324,ACT IV.,"It sounds so cold, as if you thought upon"
20325,ACT IV.,"Our pedigree, and only weighed our blood."
20326,ACT IV.,
20327,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ (_starting_).                       Blood!
20328,ACT IV.,
20329,ACT IV.,_Ida._ Why does yours start from your cheeks?
20330,ACT IV.,
20331,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                                        Aye! doth it?
20332,ACT IV.,
20333,ACT IV.,_Ida._ It doth--but no! it rushes like a torrent
20334,ACT IV.,Even to your brow again.
20335,ACT IV.,
20336,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ (_recovering himself_). And if it fled,"
20337,ACT IV.,It only was because your presence sent it                          160
20338,ACT IV.,"Back to my heart, which beats for you, sweet Cousin!"
20339,ACT IV.,
20340,ACT IV.,"_Ida._   ""Cousin"" again."
20341,ACT IV.,
20342,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                  Nay, then, I'll call you sister."
20343,ACT IV.,
20344,ACT IV.,_Ida._ I like that name still worse.--Would we had ne'er
20345,ACT IV.,Been aught of kindred!
20346,ACT IV.,
20347,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ (_gloomily_). Would we never had!
20348,ACT IV.,
20349,ACT IV.,"_Ida._ Oh, heavens! and can _you wish that?_"
20350,ACT IV.,
20351,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                                       Dearest Ida!
20352,ACT IV.,Did I not echo your own wish?
20353,ACT IV.,
20354,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                        Yes, Ulric,"
20355,ACT IV.,"But then I wished it not with such a glance,"
20356,ACT IV.,And scarce knew what I said; but let me be
20357,ACT IV.,"Sister, or cousin, what you will, so that"
20358,ACT IV.,I still to you am something.
20359,ACT IV.,
20360,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                      You shall be                           170
20361,ACT IV.,All--all----
20362,ACT IV.,
20363,ACT IV.,_Ida._        And you to _me are_ so already;
20364,ACT IV.,But I can wait.
20365,ACT IV.,
20366,ACT IV.,_Ulr._          Dear Ida!
20367,ACT IV.,
20368,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                  Call me Ida,"
20369,ACT IV.,"_Your_ Ida, for I would be yours, none else's--"
20370,ACT IV.,"Indeed I have none else left, since my poor father--"
20371,ACT IV.,[_She pauses_.
20372,ACT IV.,
20373,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ You have _mine_--you have _me_.
20374,ACT IV.,
20375,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                                 Dear Ulric, how I wish"
20376,ACT IV.,"My father could but view my happiness,"
20377,ACT IV.,Which wants but this!
20378,ACT IV.,
20379,ACT IV.,_Ulr._               Indeed!
20380,ACT IV.,
20381,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                       You would have loved him,"
20382,ACT IV.,He you; for the brave ever love each other:
20383,ACT IV.,"His manner was a little cold, his spirit"
20384,ACT IV.,Proud (as is birth's prerogative); but under                       180
20385,ACT IV.,This grave exterior----Would you had known each other!
20386,ACT IV.,"Had such as you been near him on his journey,"
20387,ACT IV.,He had not died without a friend to soothe
20388,ACT IV.,His last and lonely moments.
20389,ACT IV.,
20390,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                       Who says _that?_
20391,ACT IV.,
20392,ACT IV.,_Ida._ What?
20393,ACT IV.,
20394,ACT IV.,_Ulr._       That he _died alone_.
20395,ACT IV.,
20396,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                            The general rumour,"
20397,ACT IV.,"And disappearance of his servants, who"
20398,ACT IV.,Have ne'er returned: that fever was most deadly
20399,ACT IV.,Which swept them all away.
20400,ACT IV.,
20401,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                     If they were near him,"
20402,ACT IV.,He could not die neglected or alone.
20403,ACT IV.,
20404,ACT IV.,"_Ida._ Alas! what is a menial to a death-bed,                      190"
20405,ACT IV.,When the dim eye rolls vainly round for what
20406,ACT IV.,It loves?--They say he died of a fever.
20407,ACT IV.,
20408,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                                _Say!_
20409,ACT IV.,It _was_ so.
20410,ACT IV.,
20411,ACT IV.,_Ida._       I sometimes dream otherwise.
20412,ACT IV.,
20413,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ All dreams are false.
20414,ACT IV.,
20415,ACT IV.,_Ida._                       And yet I see him as
20416,ACT IV.,I see you.
20417,ACT IV.,
20418,ACT IV.,_Ulr._    _Where?_
20419,ACT IV.,
20420,ACT IV.,_Ida._            In sleep--I see him lie
20421,ACT IV.,"Pale, bleeding, and a man with a raised knife"
20422,ACT IV.,Beside him.
20423,ACT IV.,
20424,ACT IV.,_Ulr._       But you do not see his _face?_
20425,ACT IV.,
20426,ACT IV.,"_Ida_ (_looking at him_). No! Oh, my God! do _you?_"
20427,ACT IV.,
20428,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                                              Why do you ask?
20429,ACT IV.,
20430,ACT IV.,_Ida._ Because you look as if you saw a murderer!
20431,ACT IV.,
20432,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ (_agitatedly_).
20433,ACT IV.,"Ida, this is mere childishness; your weakness                      200"
20434,ACT IV.,"Infects me, to my shame: but as all feelings"
20435,ACT IV.,"Of yours are common to me, it affects me."
20436,ACT IV.,"Prithee, sweet child, change----"
20437,ACT IV.,
20438,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                           Child, indeed! I have"
20439,ACT IV.,Full fifteen summers!                               [_A bugle sounds_.
20440,ACT IV.,
20441,ACT IV.,"_Rod._                Hark, my Lord, the bugle!"
20442,ACT IV.,
20443,ACT IV.,_Ida_ (_peevishly to_ RODOLPH).
20444,ACT IV.,Why need you tell him that? Can he not hear it
20445,ACT IV.,Without your echo?
20446,ACT IV.,
20447,ACT IV.,"_Rod._            Pardon me, fair Baroness!"
20448,ACT IV.,
20449,ACT IV.,"_Ida._ I will not pardon you, unless you earn it"
20450,ACT IV.,By aiding me in my dissuasion of
20451,ACT IV.,Count Ulric from the chase to-day.
20452,ACT IV.,
20453,ACT IV.,"_Rod._                             You will not,"
20454,ACT IV.,"Lady, need aid of mine."
20455,ACT IV.,
20456,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                  I must not now                             210
20457,ACT IV.,Forgo it.
20458,ACT IV.,
20459,ACT IV.,_Ida._    But you shall!
20460,ACT IV.,
20461,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                  _Shall!_
20462,ACT IV.,
20463,ACT IV.,"_Ida._                          Yes, or be"
20464,ACT IV.,"No true knight.--Come, dear Ulric! yield to me"
20465,ACT IV.,"In this, for this one day: the day looks heavy,"
20466,ACT IV.,And you are turned so pale and ill.
20467,ACT IV.,
20468,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                              You jest.
20469,ACT IV.,
20470,ACT IV.,_Ida._ Indeed I do not:--ask of Rodolph.
20471,ACT IV.,
20472,ACT IV.,"_Rod._                                   Truly,"
20473,ACT IV.,"My Lord, within this quarter of an hour"
20474,ACT IV.,You have changed more than e'er I saw you change
20475,ACT IV.,In years.
20476,ACT IV.,
20477,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._    'Tis nothing; but if 'twere, the air"
20478,ACT IV.,"Would soon restore me. I'm the true cameleon,"
20479,ACT IV.,And live but on the atmosphere;[196] your feasts                   220
20480,ACT IV.,"In castle halls, and social banquets, nurse not"
20481,ACT IV.,My spirit--I'm a forester and breather
20482,ACT IV.,"Of the steep mountain-tops,[197] where I love all"
20483,ACT IV.,The eagle loves.
20484,ACT IV.,
20485,ACT IV.,"_Ida._          Except his prey, I hope."
20486,ACT IV.,
20487,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ Sweet Ida, wish me a fair chase, and I"
20488,ACT IV.,Will bring you six boars' heads for trophies home.
20489,ACT IV.,
20490,ACT IV.,"_Ida._ And will you not stay, then? You shall not go!"
20491,ACT IV.,Come! I will sing to you.
20492,ACT IV.,
20493,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                    Ida, you scarcely"
20494,ACT IV.,Will make a soldier's wife.
20495,ACT IV.,
20496,ACT IV.,_Ida._                      I do not wish
20497,ACT IV.,"To be so; for I trust these wars are over,                         230"
20498,ACT IV.,And you will live in peace on your domains.
20499,ACT IV.,
20500,ACT IV.,_Enter_ WERNER _as_ COUNT SIEGENDORF.
20501,ACT IV.,
20502,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ My father, I salute you, and it grieves me"
20503,ACT IV.,With such brief greeting.--You have heard our bugle;
20504,ACT IV.,The vassals wait.
20505,ACT IV.,
20506,ACT IV.,_Sieg._           So let them.--You forget
20507,ACT IV.,To-morrow is the appointed festival
20508,ACT IV.,In Prague[198] for peace restored. You are apt to follow
20509,ACT IV.,The chase with such an ardour as will scarce
20510,ACT IV.,"Permit you to return to-day, or if"
20511,ACT IV.,"Returned, too much fatigued to join to-morrow"
20512,ACT IV.,The nobles in our marshalled ranks.
20513,ACT IV.,
20514,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                             You, Count,                     240"
20515,ACT IV.,Will well supply the place of both--I am not
20516,ACT IV.,A lover of these pageantries.
20517,ACT IV.,
20518,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._                       No, Ulric;"
20519,ACT IV.,It were not well that you alone of all
20520,ACT IV.,Our young nobility----
20521,ACT IV.,
20522,ACT IV.,_Ida._                 And far the noblest
20523,ACT IV.,In aspect and demeanour.
20524,ACT IV.,
20525,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ (_to_ IDA).     True, dear child,"
20526,ACT IV.,Though somewhat frankly said for a fair damsel.--
20527,ACT IV.,"But, Ulric, recollect too our position,"
20528,ACT IV.,So lately reinstated in our honours.
20529,ACT IV.,"Believe me, 'twould be marked in any house,"
20530,ACT IV.,"But most in _ours_, that ONE should be found wanting               250"
20531,ACT IV.,"At such a time and place. Besides, the Heaven"
20532,ACT IV.,"Which gave us back our own, in the same moment"
20533,ACT IV.,"It spread its peace o'er all, hath double claims"
20534,ACT IV.,"On us for thanksgiving: first, for our country;"
20535,ACT IV.,"And next, that we are here to share its blessings."
20536,ACT IV.,
20537,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ (_aside_). Devout, too! Well, sir, I obey at once."
20538,ACT IV.,(_Then aloud to a servant_.)
20539,ACT IV.,"Ludwig, dismiss the train without!"
20540,ACT IV.,[_Exit_ LUDWIG.
20541,ACT IV.,_Ida._                             And so
20542,ACT IV.,"You yield, at once, to him what I for hours"
20543,ACT IV.,Might supplicate in vain.
20544,ACT IV.,
20545,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ (_smiling_).      You are not jealous
20546,ACT IV.,"Of me, I trust, my pretty rebel! who                               260"
20547,ACT IV.,Would sanction disobedience against all
20548,ACT IV.,Except thyself? But fear not; thou shalt rule him
20549,ACT IV.,Hereafter with a fonder sway and firmer.
20550,ACT IV.,
20551,ACT IV.,_Ida._ But I should like to govern _now_.
20552,ACT IV.,
20553,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._                                   You shall,"
20554,ACT IV.,"Your _harp_, which by the way awaits you with"
20555,ACT IV.,The Countess in her chamber. She complains
20556,ACT IV.,That you are a sad truant to your music:
20557,ACT IV.,She attends you.
20558,ACT IV.,
20559,ACT IV.,"_Ida._           Then good morrow, my kind kinsmen!"
20560,ACT IV.,"Ulric, you'll come and hear me?"
20561,ACT IV.,
20562,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                          By and by.
20563,ACT IV.,
20564,ACT IV.,_Ida._ Be sure I'll sound it better than your bugles;              270
20565,ACT IV.,Then pray you be as punctual to its notes:
20566,ACT IV.,I'll play you King Gustavus' march.
20567,ACT IV.,
20568,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                              And why not
20569,ACT IV.,Old Tilly's?
20570,ACT IV.,
20571,ACT IV.,_Ida._       Not that monster's! I should think
20572,ACT IV.,"My harp-strings rang with groans, and not with music,"
20573,ACT IV.,Could aught of _his_ sound on it:--but come quickly;
20574,ACT IV.,Your mother will be eager to receive you.                 [_Exit_ IDA.
20575,ACT IV.,
20576,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ Ulric, I wish to speak with you alone."
20577,ACT IV.,
20578,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ My time's your vassal.--
20579,ACT IV.,"(_Aside to_ RODOLPH.) Rodolph, hence! and do"
20580,ACT IV.,As I directed: and by his best speed
20581,ACT IV.,And readiest means let Rosenberg reply.                            280
20582,ACT IV.,
20583,ACT IV.,"_Rod._ Count Siegendorf, command you aught? I am bound"
20584,ACT IV.,Upon a journey past the frontier.
20585,ACT IV.,
20586,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ (_starts_).                Ah!--
20587,ACT IV.,Where? on _what_ frontier?
20588,ACT IV.,
20589,ACT IV.,"_Rod._                    The Silesian, on"
20590,ACT IV.,My way--(_Aside to_ ULRIC.)--_Where_ shall I say?
20591,ACT IV.,
20592,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ (_aside to_ RODOLPH).         To Hamburgh.
20593,ACT IV.,(_Aside to himself_). That
20594,ACT IV.,"Word will, I think, put a firm padlock on"
20595,ACT IV.,His further inquisition.
20596,ACT IV.,
20597,ACT IV.,"_Rod._                   Count, to Hamburgh."
20598,ACT IV.,
20599,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ (_agitated_). Hamburgh! No, I have nought to do there, nor"
20600,ACT IV.,Am aught connected with that city. Then
20601,ACT IV.,God speed you!
20602,ACT IV.,
20603,ACT IV.,"_Rod._         Fare ye well, Count Siegendorf!"
20604,ACT IV.,[_Exit_ RODOLPH.
20605,ACT IV.,
20606,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ Ulric, this man, who has just departed, is                 290"
20607,ACT IV.,One of those strange companions whom I fain
20608,ACT IV.,Would reason with you on.
20609,ACT IV.,
20610,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                    My Lord, he is"
20611,ACT IV.,"Noble by birth, of one of the first houses"
20612,ACT IV.,In Saxony.
20613,ACT IV.,
20614,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._    I talk not of his birth,"
20615,ACT IV.,But of his bearing. Men speak lightly of him.
20616,ACT IV.,
20617,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ So they will do of most men. Even the monarch
20618,ACT IV.,"Is not fenced from his chamberlain's slander, or"
20619,ACT IV.,The sneer of the last courtier whom he has made
20620,ACT IV.,Great and ungrateful.
20621,ACT IV.,
20622,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._               If I must be plain,"
20623,ACT IV.,The world speaks more than lightly of this Rodolph:                300
20624,ACT IV.,"They say he is leagued with the ""black bands"" who still"
20625,ACT IV.,Ravage the frontier.
20626,ACT IV.,
20627,ACT IV.,_Ulr._               And will you believe
20628,ACT IV.,The world?
20629,ACT IV.,
20630,ACT IV.,_Sieg._    In this case--yes.
20631,ACT IV.,
20632,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                       In _any_ case,"
20633,ACT IV.,I thought you knew it better than to take
20634,ACT IV.,An accusation for a sentence.
20635,ACT IV.,
20636,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                       Son!
20637,ACT IV.,I understand you: you refer to----but
20638,ACT IV.,My destiny has so involved about me
20639,ACT IV.,"Her spider web, that I can only flutter"
20640,ACT IV.,"Like the poor fly, but break it not. Take heed,"
20641,ACT IV.,Ulric; you have seen to what the passions led me:                  310
20642,ACT IV.,Twenty long years of misery and famine
20643,ACT IV.,"Quenched them not--twenty thousand more, perchance,"
20644,ACT IV.,Hereafter (or even here in _moments_ which
20645,ACT IV.,"Might date for years, did Anguish make the dial),"
20646,ACT IV.,May not obliterate or expiate
20647,ACT IV.,The madness and dishonour of an instant.
20648,ACT IV.,"Ulric, be warned by a father!--I was not"
20649,ACT IV.,"By mine, and you behold me!"
20650,ACT IV.,
20651,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                     I behold
20652,ACT IV.,"The prosperous and belovéd Siegendorf,"
20653,ACT IV.,"Lord of a Prince's appanage, and honoured                          320"
20654,ACT IV.,By those he rules and those he ranks with.
20655,ACT IV.,
20656,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                                    Ah!
20657,ACT IV.,"Why wilt thou call me prosperous, while I fear"
20658,ACT IV.,"For thee? Belovéd, when thou lovest me not!"
20659,ACT IV.,All hearts but one may beat in kindness for me--
20660,ACT IV.,But if my son's is cold!----
20661,ACT IV.,
20662,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                       Who _dare_ say that?
20663,ACT IV.,
20664,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ None else but I, who see it--_feel_ it--keener"
20665,ACT IV.,"Than would your adversary, who dared say so,"
20666,ACT IV.,Your sabre in his heart! But mine survives
20667,ACT IV.,The wound.
20668,ACT IV.,
20669,ACT IV.,_Ulr._     You err. My nature is not given
20670,ACT IV.,"To outward fondling: how should it be so,                          330"
20671,ACT IV.,After twelve years' divorcement from my parents?
20672,ACT IV.,
20673,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ And did not _I_ too pass those twelve torn years
20674,ACT IV.,In a like absence? But 'tis vain to urge you--
20675,ACT IV.,Nature was never called back by remonstrance.
20676,ACT IV.,Let's change the theme. I wish you to consider
20677,ACT IV.,"That these young violent nobles of high name,"
20678,ACT IV.,"But dark deeds (aye, the darkest, if all Rumour"
20679,ACT IV.,"Reports be true), with whom thou consortest,"
20680,ACT IV.,Will lead thee----
20681,ACT IV.,
20682,ACT IV.,_Ulr._ (_impatiently_). I'll be _led_ by no man.
20683,ACT IV.,
20684,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                                         Nor
20685,ACT IV.,"Be leader of such, I would hope: at once                           340"
20686,ACT IV.,To wean thee from the perils of thy youth
20687,ACT IV.,"And haughty spirit, I have thought it well"
20688,ACT IV.,That thou shouldst wed the lady Ida--more
20689,ACT IV.,As thou appear'st to love her.
20690,ACT IV.,
20691,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                        I have said
20692,ACT IV.,"I will obey your orders, were they to"
20693,ACT IV.,Unite with Hecate--can a son say more?
20694,ACT IV.,
20695,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ He says too much in saying this. It is not
20696,ACT IV.,"The nature of thine age, nor of thy blood,"
20697,ACT IV.,"Nor of thy temperament, to talk so coolly,"
20698,ACT IV.,"Or act so carelessly, in that which is                             350"
20699,ACT IV.,"The bloom or blight of all men's happiness,"
20700,ACT IV.,"(For Glory's pillow is but restless, if"
20701,ACT IV.,"Love lay not down his cheek there): some strong bias,"
20702,ACT IV.,"Some master fiend is in thy service, to"
20703,ACT IV.,"Misrule the mortal who believes him slave,"
20704,ACT IV.,And makes his every thought subservient; else
20705,ACT IV.,"Thou'dst say at once--""I love young Ida, and"
20706,ACT IV.,"Will wed her;"" or, ""I love her not, and all"
20707,ACT IV.,"The powers on earth shall never make me.""--So"
20708,ACT IV.,Would _I_ have answered.
20709,ACT IV.,
20710,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                  Sir, _you_ wed for love.                   360"
20711,ACT IV.,
20712,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ I did, and it has been my only refuge"
20713,ACT IV.,In many miseries.
20714,ACT IV.,
20715,ACT IV.,_Ulr._            Which miseries
20716,ACT IV.,Had never been but for this love-match.
20717,ACT IV.,
20718,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                                 Still
20719,ACT IV.,Against your age and nature! Who at twenty
20720,ACT IV.,E'er answered thus till now?
20721,ACT IV.,
20722,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                       Did you not warn me
20723,ACT IV.,Against your own example?
20724,ACT IV.,
20725,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                  Boyish sophist!
20726,ACT IV.,"In a word, do you love, or love not, Ida?"
20727,ACT IV.,
20728,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ What matters it, if I am ready to"
20729,ACT IV.,Obey you in espousing her?
20730,ACT IV.,
20731,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                    As far
20732,ACT IV.,"As you feel, nothing--but all life for her.                        370"
20733,ACT IV.,She's young--all-beautiful--adores you--is
20734,ACT IV.,"Endowed with qualities to give happiness,"
20735,ACT IV.,Such as rounds common life into a dream
20736,ACT IV.,"Of something which your poets cannot paint,"
20737,ACT IV.,"And (if it were not wisdom to love virtue),"
20738,ACT IV.,For which Philosophy might barter Wisdom;
20739,ACT IV.,"And giving so much happiness, deserves"
20740,ACT IV.,A little in return. I would not have her
20741,ACT IV.,Break her heart with a man who has none to break!
20742,ACT IV.,Or wither on her stalk like some pale rose                         380
20743,ACT IV.,"Deserted by the bird she thought a nightingale,"
20744,ACT IV.,According to the Orient tale.[199] She is----
20745,ACT IV.,
20746,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ The daughter of dead Stralenheim, your foe:"
20747,ACT IV.,"I'll wed her, ne'ertheless; though, to say truth,"
20748,ACT IV.,Just now I am not violently transported
20749,ACT IV.,In favour of such unions.
20750,ACT IV.,
20751,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                   But she loves you.
20752,ACT IV.,
20753,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ And I love her, and therefore would think _twice_."
20754,ACT IV.,
20755,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ Alas! Love never did so.
20756,ACT IV.,
20757,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                           Then 'tis time
20758,ACT IV.,"He should begin, and take the bandage from"
20759,ACT IV.,"His eyes, and look before he leaps; till now                       390"
20760,ACT IV.,He hath ta'en a jump i' the dark.
20761,ACT IV.,
20762,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                           But you consent?
20763,ACT IV.,
20764,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ I did, and do."
20765,ACT IV.,
20766,ACT IV.,_Sieg._               Then fix the day.
20767,ACT IV.,
20768,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._                                 Tis usual,"
20769,ACT IV.,"And, certes, courteous, to leave that to the lady."
20770,ACT IV.,
20771,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ _I_ will engage for _her_.
20772,ACT IV.,
20773,ACT IV.,_Ulr._                            So will not _I_
20774,ACT IV.,"For any woman: and as what I fix,"
20775,ACT IV.,"I fain would see unshaken, when she gives"
20776,ACT IV.,"Her answer, I'll give mine."
20777,ACT IV.,
20778,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                     But 'tis your office
20779,ACT IV.,To woo.
20780,ACT IV.,
20781,ACT IV.,"_Ulr._ Count, 'tis a marriage of your making,"
20782,ACT IV.,"So be it of your wooing; but to please you,"
20783,ACT IV.,"I will now pay my duty to my mother,                               400"
20784,ACT IV.,"With whom, you know, the lady Ida is.--"
20785,ACT IV.,What would you have? You have forbid my stirring
20786,ACT IV.,"For manly sports beyond the castle walls,"
20787,ACT IV.,"And I obey; you bid me turn a chamberer,"
20788,ACT IV.,"To pick up gloves, and fans, and knitting-needles,"
20789,ACT IV.,"And list to songs and tunes, and watch for smiles,"
20790,ACT IV.,"And smile at pretty prattle, and look into"
20791,ACT IV.,"The eyes of feminine, as though they were"
20792,ACT IV.,The stars receding early to our wish
20793,ACT IV.,Upon the dawn of a world-winning battle--                          410
20794,ACT IV.,What can a son or man do more?                          [_Exit_ ULRIC.
20795,ACT IV.,
20796,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ (_solus_).             Too much!--
20797,ACT IV.,"Too much of duty, and too little love!"
20798,ACT IV.,He pays me in the coin he owes me not:
20799,ACT IV.,"For such hath been my wayward fate, I could not"
20800,ACT IV.,Fulfil a parent's duties by his side
20801,ACT IV.,"Till now; but love he owes me, for my thoughts"
20802,ACT IV.,"Ne'er left him, nor my eyes longed without tears"
20803,ACT IV.,"To see my child again,--and now I have found him!"
20804,ACT IV.,"But how! obedient, but with coldness; duteous"
20805,ACT IV.,"In my sight, but with carelessness; mysterious--                   420"
20806,ACT IV.,"Abstracted--distant--much given to long absence,"
20807,ACT IV.,And where--none know--in league with the most riotous
20808,ACT IV.,"Of our young nobles; though, to do him justice,"
20809,ACT IV.,He never stoops down to their vulgar pleasures;
20810,ACT IV.,Yet there's some tie between them which I can not
20811,ACT IV.,Unravel. They look up to him--consult him--
20812,ACT IV.,Throng round him as a leader: but with me
20813,ACT IV.,He hath no confidence! Ah! can I hope it
20814,ACT IV.,After--what! doth my father's curse descend
20815,ACT IV.,Even to my child? Or is the Hungarian near                         430
20816,ACT IV.,To shed more blood? or--Oh! if it should be!
20817,ACT IV.,"Spirit of Stralenheim, dost thou walk these walls"
20818,ACT IV.,"To wither him and his--who, though they slew not,"
20819,ACT IV.,Unlatched the door of Death for thee? 'Twas not
20820,ACT IV.,"Our fault, nor is our sin: thou wert our foe,"
20821,ACT IV.,And yet I spared thee when my own destruction
20822,ACT IV.,"Slept with thee, to awake with thine awakening!"
20823,ACT IV.,And only took--Accurséd gold! thou liest
20824,ACT IV.,"Like poison in my hands; I dare not use thee,"
20825,ACT IV.,"Nor part from thee; thou camest in such a guise,                   440"
20826,ACT IV.,Methinks thou wouldst contaminate all hands
20827,ACT IV.,"Like mine. Yet I have done, to atone for thee,"
20828,ACT IV.,"Thou villanous gold! and thy dead master's doom,"
20829,ACT IV.,"Though he died not by me or mine, as much"
20830,ACT IV.,As if he were my brother! I have ta'en
20831,ACT IV.,His orphan Ida--cherished her as one
20832,ACT IV.,Who will be mine.
20833,ACT IV.,
20834,ACT IV.,_Enter an_ ATTENDANT.
20835,ACT IV.,
20836,ACT IV.,"_Atten._          The abbot, if it please"
20837,ACT IV.,"Your Excellency, whom you sent for, waits"
20838,ACT IV.,Upon you.                                           [_Exit_ ATTENDANT.
20839,ACT IV.,
20840,ACT IV.,_Enter the_ PRIOR ALBERT.
20841,ACT IV.,
20842,ACT IV.,"_Prior_. Peace be with these walls, and all"
20843,ACT IV.,Within them!
20844,ACT IV.,
20845,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._      Welcome, welcome, holy father!                        450"
20846,ACT IV.,And may thy prayer be heard!--all men have need
20847,ACT IV.,"Of such, and I----"
20848,ACT IV.,
20849,ACT IV.,_Prior_.            Have the first claim to all
20850,ACT IV.,"The prayers of our community. Our convent,"
20851,ACT IV.,"Erected by your ancestors, is still"
20852,ACT IV.,Protected by their children.
20853,ACT IV.,
20854,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._                      Yes, good father;"
20855,ACT IV.,Continue daily orisons for us
20856,ACT IV.,"In these dim days of heresies and blood,"
20857,ACT IV.,"Though the schismatic Swede, Gustavus, is"
20858,ACT IV.,Gone home.
20859,ACT IV.,
20860,ACT IV.,"_Prior_.    To the endless home of unbelievers,"
20861,ACT IV.,"Where there is everlasting wail and woe,                           460"
20862,ACT IV.,"Gnashing of teeth, and tears of blood, and fire"
20863,ACT IV.,Eternal and the worm which dieth not!
20864,ACT IV.,
20865,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ True, father: and to avert those pangs from one,"
20866,ACT IV.,"Who, though of our most faultless holy Church,"
20867,ACT IV.,"Yet died without its last and dearest offices,"
20868,ACT IV.,"Which smooth the soul through purgatorial pains,"
20869,ACT IV.,I have to offer humbly this donation
20870,ACT IV.,In masses for his spirit.
20871,ACT IV.,[SIEGENDORF _offers the gold which he had taken from_ STRALENHEIM.
20872,ACT IV.,
20873,ACT IV.,"_Prior_.                 Count, if I"
20874,ACT IV.,"Receive it, 'tis because I know too well"
20875,ACT IV.,Refusal would offend you. Be assured                               470
20876,ACT IV.,"The largess shall be only dealt in alms,"
20877,ACT IV.,And every mass no less sung for the dead.
20878,ACT IV.,"Our House needs no donations, thanks to yours,"
20879,ACT IV.,Which has of old endowed it; but from you
20880,ACT IV.,And yours in all meet things 'tis fit we obey.
20881,ACT IV.,For whom shall mass be said?
20882,ACT IV.,
20883,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ (_faltering_).       For--for--the dead.
20884,ACT IV.,
20885,ACT IV.,_Prior_. His name?
20886,ACT IV.,
20887,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._           'Tis from a soul, and not a name,"
20888,ACT IV.,I would avert perdition.
20889,ACT IV.,
20890,ACT IV.,_Prior_.                 I meant not
20891,ACT IV.,To pry into your secret. We will pray
20892,ACT IV.,"For one unknown, the same as for the proudest.                     480"
20893,ACT IV.,
20894,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ Secret! I have none: but, father, he who's gone"
20895,ACT IV.,"Might _have_ one; or, in short, he did bequeath--"
20896,ACT IV.,"No, not bequeath--but I bestow this sum"
20897,ACT IV.,For pious purposes.
20898,ACT IV.,
20899,ACT IV.,_Prior_.            A proper deed
20900,ACT IV.,In the behalf of our departed friends.
20901,ACT IV.,
20902,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ But he who's gone was not my friend, but foe,"
20903,ACT IV.,The deadliest and the stanchest.
20904,ACT IV.,
20905,ACT IV.,_Prior_.                         Better still!
20906,ACT IV.,To employ our means to obtain Heaven for the souls
20907,ACT IV.,Of our dead enemies is worthy those
20908,ACT IV.,Who can forgive them living.
20909,ACT IV.,
20910,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                      But I did not                         490
20911,ACT IV.,"Forgive this man. I loathed him to the last,"
20912,ACT IV.,"As he did me. I do not love him now,"
20913,ACT IV.,But----
20914,ACT IV.,
20915,ACT IV.,_Prior_. Best of all! for this is pure religion!
20916,ACT IV.,You fain would rescue him you hate from hell--
20917,ACT IV.,An evangelical compassion--with
20918,ACT IV.,Your own gold too!
20919,ACT IV.,
20920,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._           Father, 'tis not my gold."
20921,ACT IV.,
20922,ACT IV.,"_Prior_. Whose, then? You said it was no legacy."
20923,ACT IV.,
20924,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._ No matter whose--of this be sure, that he"
20925,ACT IV.,"Who owned it never more will need it, save"
20926,ACT IV.,In that which it may purchase from your altars:                    500
20927,ACT IV.,"'Tis yours, or theirs."
20928,ACT IV.,
20929,ACT IV.,_Prior_.               Is there no blood upon it?
20930,ACT IV.,
20931,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ No; but there's worse than blood--eternal shame!
20932,ACT IV.,
20933,ACT IV.,_Prior_. Did he who owned it die in his _bed?_
20934,ACT IV.,
20935,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                                        Alas!
20936,ACT IV.,He did.
20937,ACT IV.,
20938,ACT IV.,"_Prior_. Son! you relapse into revenge,"
20939,ACT IV.,If you regret your enemy's bloodless death.
20940,ACT IV.,
20941,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ His death was fathomlessly deep in blood.
20942,ACT IV.,
20943,ACT IV.,"_Prior_. You said he died in his bed, not battle."
20944,ACT IV.,
20945,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                                           He
20946,ACT IV.,"Died, I scarce know--but--he was stabbed i' the dark,"
20947,ACT IV.,And now you have it--perished on his pillow
20948,ACT IV.,By a cut-throat!--Aye!--you may look upon me!                      510
20949,ACT IV.,"_I_ am _not_ the man. I'll meet your eye on that point,"
20950,ACT IV.,As I can one day God's.
20951,ACT IV.,
20952,ACT IV.,_Prior_.                Nor did he die
20953,ACT IV.,"By means, or men, or instrument of yours?"
20954,ACT IV.,
20955,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ No! by the God who sees and strikes!
20956,ACT IV.,
20957,ACT IV.,_Prior_.                                     Nor know you
20958,ACT IV.,Who slew him?
20959,ACT IV.,
20960,ACT IV.,"_Sieg._       I could only guess at _one_,"
20961,ACT IV.,"And he to me a stranger, unconnected,"
20962,ACT IV.,"As unemployed. Except by one day's knowledge,"
20963,ACT IV.,I never saw the man who was suspected.
20964,ACT IV.,
20965,ACT IV.,_Prior_. Then you are free from guilt.
20966,ACT IV.,
20967,ACT IV.,_Sieg._ (_eagerly_).                  Oh! _am_ I?--say!
20968,ACT IV.,
20969,ACT IV.,"_Prior_. You have said so, and know best."
20970,ACT IV.,
20971,ACT IV.,_Sieg._                                   Father! I have spoken    520
20972,ACT IV.,"The truth, and nought but truth, if _not_ the _whole_;"
20973,ACT IV.,Yet say I am _not_ guilty! for the blood
20974,ACT IV.,"Of this man weighs on me, as if I shed it,"
20975,ACT IV.,"Though, by the Power who abhorreth human blood,"
20976,ACT IV.,"I did not!--nay, once spared it, when I might"
20977,ACT IV.,"And _could_--aye, perhaps, _should_ (if our self-safety"
20978,ACT IV.,Be e'er excusable in such defences
20979,ACT IV.,Against the attacks of over-potent foes):
20980,ACT IV.,"But pray for him, for me, and all my house;"
20981,ACT IV.,"For, as I said, though I be innocent,"
20982,ACT IV.,"I know not why, a like remorse is on me,"
20983,ACT IV.,"As if he had fallen by me or mine. Pray for me,"
20984,ACT IV.,Father! I have prayed myself in vain.
20985,ACT IV.,
20986,ACT IV.,_Prior_.                              I will.
20987,ACT IV.,"Be comforted! You are innocent, and should"
20988,ACT IV.,Be calm as innocence.
20989,ACT IV.,
20990,ACT IV.,_Sieg._               But calmness is not
20991,ACT IV.,Always the attribute of innocence.
20992,ACT IV.,I feel it is not.
20993,ACT IV.,
20994,ACT IV.,"_Prior_.          But it will be so,"
20995,ACT IV.,When the mind gathers up its truth within it.
20996,ACT IV.,"Remember the great festival to-morrow,"
20997,ACT IV.,"In which you rank amidst our chiefest nobles,"
20998,ACT IV.,"As well as your brave son; and smooth your aspect,"
20999,ACT IV.,Nor in the general orison of thanks
21000,ACT IV.,"For bloodshed stopt, let blood you shed not rise,"
21001,ACT IV.,"A cloud, upon your thoughts. This were to be"
21002,ACT IV.,"Too sensitive. Take comfort, and forget"
21003,ACT IV.,"Such things, and leave remorse unto the guilty.             [_Exeunt_."
21004,ACT IV.,
21005,ACT IV.,
21006,ACT IV.,
21007,ACT IV.,
21008,ACT V.,ACT V.
21009,ACT V.,
21010,ACT V.,
21011,ACT V.,SCENE I.--_A large and magnificent Gothic Hall in the
21012,ACT V.,"Castle of Siegendorf, decorated with Trophies, Banners,"
21013,ACT V.,and Arms of that Family_.
21014,ACT V.,
21015,ACT V.,"_Enter_ ARNHEIM _and_ MEISTER, _attendants of_ COUNT SIEGENDORF."
21016,ACT V.,
21017,ACT V.,_Arn._ Be quick! the Count will soon return: the ladies
21018,ACT V.,Already are at the portal. Have you sent
21019,ACT V.,The messengers in search of him he seeks for?
21020,ACT V.,
21021,ACT V.,"_Meis._ I have, in all directions, over Prague,"
21022,ACT V.,As far as the man's dress and figure could
21023,ACT V.,By your description track him. The devil take
21024,ACT V.,These revels and processions! All the pleasure
21025,ACT V.,"(If such there be) must fall to the spectators,--"
21026,ACT V.,I'm sure none doth to us who make the show.
21027,ACT V.,
21028,ACT V.,_Arn._ Go to! my Lady Countess comes.
21029,ACT V.,
21030,ACT V.,_Meis._                              I'd rather                     10
21031,ACT V.,"Ride a day's hunting on an outworn jade,"
21032,ACT V.,"Than follow in the train of a great man,"
21033,ACT V.,In these dull pageantries.
21034,ACT V.,
21035,ACT V.,_Arn._                     Begone! and rail
21036,ACT V.,Within.                                                     [_Exeunt_.
21037,ACT V.,
21038,ACT V.,_Enter the_ COUNTESS JOSEPHINE SIEGENDORF _and_ IDA STRALENHEIM.
21039,ACT V.,
21040,ACT V.,"_Jos._ Well, Heaven be praised! the show is over."
21041,ACT V.,
21042,ACT V.,_Ida._ How can you say so? Never have I dreamt
21043,ACT V.,"Of aught so beautiful. The flowers, the boughs,"
21044,ACT V.,"The banners, and the nobles, and the knights,"
21045,ACT V.,"The gems, the robes, the plumes, the happy faces,"
21046,ACT V.,"The coursers, and the incense, and the sun"
21047,ACT V.,"Streaming through the stained windows, even the _tombs_,            20"
21048,ACT V.,"Which looked so calm, and the celestial hymns,"
21049,ACT V.,Which seemed as if they rather came from Heaven
21050,ACT V.,Than mounted there--the bursting organ's peal
21051,ACT V.,Rolling on high like an harmonious thunder;
21052,ACT V.,The white robes and the lifted eyes; the world
21053,ACT V.,At peace! and all at peace with one another!
21054,ACT V.,"Oh, my sweet mother!                           [_Embracing_ JOSEPHINE."
21055,ACT V.,
21056,ACT V.,_Jos._               My belovéd child!
21057,ACT V.,"For such, I trust, thou shalt be shortly."
21058,ACT V.,
21059,ACT V.,_Ida._                                   Oh!
21060,ACT V.,I am so already. Feel how my heart beats!
21061,ACT V.,
21062,ACT V.,"_Jos._ It does, my love; and never may it throb                     30"
21063,ACT V.,With aught more bitter.
21064,ACT V.,
21065,ACT V.,_Ida._                 Never shall it do so!
21066,ACT V.,How should it? What should make us grieve? I hate
21067,ACT V.,"To hear of sorrow: how can we be sad,"
21068,ACT V.,"Who love each other so entirely? You,"
21069,ACT V.,"The Count, and Ulric, and your daughter Ida."
21070,ACT V.,
21071,ACT V.,_Jos._ Poor child!
21072,ACT V.,
21073,ACT V.,_Ida._             Do you pity me?
21074,ACT V.,
21075,ACT V.,"_Jos._                            No: I but envy,"
21076,ACT V.,"And that in sorrow, not in the world's sense"
21077,ACT V.,"Of the universal vice, if one vice be"
21078,ACT V.,More general than another.
21079,ACT V.,
21080,ACT V.,_Ida._                     I'll not hear
21081,ACT V.,A word against a world which still contains                         40
21082,ACT V.,You and my Ulric. Did you ever see
21083,ACT V.,Aught like him? How he towered amongst them all!
21084,ACT V.,How all eyes followed him! The flowers fell faster--
21085,ACT V.,"Rained from each lattice at his feet, methought,"
21086,ACT V.,Than before all the rest; and where he trod
21087,ACT V.,"I dare be sworn that they grow still, nor e'er"
21088,ACT V.,Will wither.
21089,ACT V.,
21090,ACT V.,"_Jos._       You will spoil him, little flatterer,"
21091,ACT V.,If he should hear you.
21092,ACT V.,
21093,ACT V.,_Ida._                 But he never will.
21094,ACT V.,I dare not say so much to him--I fear him.
21095,ACT V.,
21096,ACT V.,_Jos._ Why so? he loves you well.
21097,ACT V.,
21098,ACT V.,_Ida._                            But I can never                   50
21099,ACT V.,Shape my thoughts _of_ him into words _to_ him:
21100,ACT V.,"Besides, he sometimes frightens me."
21101,ACT V.,
21102,ACT V.,_Jos._                         How so?
21103,ACT V.,"_Ida._ A cloud comes o'er his blue eyes suddenly,"
21104,ACT V.,Yet he says nothing.
21105,ACT V.,
21106,ACT V.,"_Jos._               It is nothing: all men,"
21107,ACT V.,"Especially in these dark troublous times,"
21108,ACT V.,Have much to think of.
21109,ACT V.,
21110,ACT V.,_Ida._                 But I cannot think
21111,ACT V.,Of aught save him.
21112,ACT V.,
21113,ACT V.,"_Jos._             Yet there are other men,"
21114,ACT V.,"In the world's eye, as goodly. There's, for instance,"
21115,ACT V.,"The young Count Waldorf, who scarce once withdrew"
21116,ACT V.,His eyes from yours to-day.
21117,ACT V.,
21118,ACT V.,"_Ida._                      I did not see him,                      60"
21119,ACT V.,But Ulric. Did you not see at the moment
21120,ACT V.,"When all knelt, and I wept? and yet, methought,"
21121,ACT V.,"Through my fast tears, though they were thick and warm,"
21122,ACT V.,I saw him smiling on me.
21123,ACT V.,
21124,ACT V.,_Jos._                    I could not
21125,ACT V.,"See aught save Heaven, to which my eyes were raised,"
21126,ACT V.,Together with the people's.
21127,ACT V.,
21128,ACT V.,_Ida._                     I thought too
21129,ACT V.,"Of Heaven, although I looked on Ulric."
21130,ACT V.,
21131,ACT V.,"_Jos._                                Come,"
21132,ACT V.,"Let us retire! they will be here anon,"
21133,ACT V.,Expectant of the banquet. We will lay
21134,ACT V.,Aside these nodding plumes and dragging trains.                     70
21135,ACT V.,
21136,ACT V.,"_Ida._ And, above all, these stiff and heavy jewels,"
21137,ACT V.,"Which make my head and heart ache, as both throb"
21138,ACT V.,Beneath their glitter o'er my brow and zone.
21139,ACT V.,"Dear mother, I am with you."
21140,ACT V.,
21141,ACT V.,"_Enter_ COUNT SIEGENDORF, _in full dress, from the"
21142,ACT V.,"solemnity_, and LUDWIG."
21143,ACT V.,
21144,ACT V.,_Sieg._                     Is he not found?
21145,ACT V.,
21146,ACT V.,_Lud._ Strict search is making every where; and if
21147,ACT V.,"The man be in Prague, be sure he will be found."
21148,ACT V.,
21149,ACT V.,_Sieg._ Where's Ulric?
21150,ACT V.,
21151,ACT V.,_Lud._                He rode round the other way
21152,ACT V.,With some young nobles; but he left them soon;
21153,ACT V.,"And, if I err not, not a minute since"
21154,ACT V.,"I heard his Excellency, with his train,                             80"
21155,ACT V.,Gallop o'er the west drawbridge.
21156,ACT V.,
21157,ACT V.,"_Enter ULRIC, splendidly dressed_."
21158,ACT V.,
21159,ACT V.,_Sieg._ (_to_ LUDWIG).            See they cease not
21160,ACT V.,Their quest of him I have described.                   [_Exit_ LUDWIG.
21161,ACT V.,"Oh, Ulric!"
21162,ACT V.,How have I longed for thee!
21163,ACT V.,
21164,ACT V.,_Ulr._                     Your wish is granted--
21165,ACT V.,Behold me!
21166,ACT V.,
21167,ACT V.,_Sieg._   I have seen the murderer.
21168,ACT V.,
21169,ACT V.,_Ulr._ Whom? Where?
21170,ACT V.,
21171,ACT V.,"_Sieg._             The Hungarian, who slew Stralenheim."
21172,ACT V.,
21173,ACT V.,_Ulr._ You dream.
21174,ACT V.,
21175,ACT V.,"_Sieg._           I live! and as I live, I saw him--"
21176,ACT V.,Heard him! he dared to utter even my name.
21177,ACT V.,
21178,ACT V.,_Ulr._ What name?
21179,ACT V.,
21180,ACT V.,_Sieg._            Werner! _'twas_ mine.
21181,ACT V.,
21182,ACT V.,_Ulr._                                  It must be so
21183,ACT V.,No more: forget it.
21184,ACT V.,
21185,ACT V.,_Sieg._             Never! never! all
21186,ACT V.,My destinies were woven in that name:                               90
21187,ACT V.,"It will not be engraved upon my tomb,"
21188,ACT V.,But it may lead me there.
21189,ACT V.,
21190,ACT V.,_Ulr._                   To the point----the Hungarian?
21191,ACT V.,
21192,ACT V.,_Sieg._ Listen!--The church was thronged: the hymn was raised;
21193,ACT V.,"""_Te Deum_"" pealed from nations rather than"
21194,ACT V.,"From choirs, in one great cry of ""God be praised"""
21195,ACT V.,"For one day's peace, after thrice ten dread years,"
21196,ACT V.,"Each bloodier than the former: I arose,"
21197,ACT V.,"With all the nobles, and as I looked down"
21198,ACT V.,"Along the lines of lifted faces,--from"
21199,ACT V.,"Our bannered and escutcheoned gallery, I                           100"
21200,ACT V.,"Saw, like a flash of lightning (for I saw"
21201,ACT V.,"A moment and no more), what struck me sightless"
21202,ACT V.,To all else--the Hungarian's face! I grew
21203,ACT V.,Sick; and when I recovered from the mist
21204,ACT V.,"Which curled about my senses, and again"
21205,ACT V.,"Looked down, I saw him not. The thanksgiving"
21206,ACT V.,"Was over, and we marched back in procession."
21207,ACT V.,
21208,ACT V.,_Ulr._ Continue.
21209,ACT V.,
21210,ACT V.,"_Sieg._          When we reached the Muldau's bridge,"
21211,ACT V.,"The joyous crowd above, the numberless"
21212,ACT V.,"Barks manned with revellers in their best garbs,                   110"
21213,ACT V.,"Which shot along the glancing tide below,"
21214,ACT V.,"The decorated street, the long array,"
21215,ACT V.,"The clashing music, and the thundering"
21216,ACT V.,"Of far artillery, which seemed to bid"
21217,ACT V.,"A long and loud farewell to its great doings,"
21218,ACT V.,"The standards o'er me, and the tramplings round,"
21219,ACT V.,"The roar of rushing thousands,--all--all could not"
21220,ACT V.,"Chase this man from my mind, although my senses"
21221,ACT V.,No longer held him palpable.
21222,ACT V.,
21223,ACT V.,_Ulr._                       You saw him
21224,ACT V.,"No more, then?"
21225,ACT V.,
21226,ACT V.,"_Sieg._        I looked, as a dying soldier                        120"
21227,ACT V.,"Looks at a draught of water, for this man;"
21228,ACT V.,But still I saw him not; but in his stead----
21229,ACT V.,
21230,ACT V.,_Ulr._ What in his stead?
21231,ACT V.,
21232,ACT V.,_Sieg._                  My eye for ever fell
21233,ACT V.,Upon your dancing crest; the loftiest.
21234,ACT V.,"As on the loftiest and the loveliest head,"
21235,ACT V.,"It rose the highest of the stream of plumes,"
21236,ACT V.,Which overflowed the glittering streets of Prague.
21237,ACT V.,
21238,ACT V.,_Ulr._ What's this to the Hungarian?
21239,ACT V.,
21240,ACT V.,_Sieg._                              Much! for I
21241,ACT V.,Had almost then forgot him in my son;
21242,ACT V.,"When just as the artillery ceased, and paused                      130"
21243,ACT V.,"The music, and the crowd embraced in lieu"
21244,ACT V.,"Of shouting, I heard in a deep, low voice,"
21245,ACT V.,Distinct and keener far upon my ear
21246,ACT V.,"Than the late cannon's volume, this word--""_Werner!_"""
21247,ACT V.,
21248,ACT V.,_Ulr._ Uttered by----
21249,ACT V.,
21250,ACT V.,_Sieg._                HIM! I turned--and saw--and fell.
21251,ACT V.,
21252,ACT V.,_Ulr._ And wherefore? Were you seen?
21253,ACT V.,
21254,ACT V.,_Sieg._                              The officious care
21255,ACT V.,"Of those around me dragged me from the spot,"
21256,ACT V.,"Seeing my faintness, ignorant of the cause:"
21257,ACT V.,"You, too, were too remote in the procession"
21258,ACT V.,(The old nobles being divided from their children)                 140
21259,ACT V.,To aid me.
21260,ACT V.,
21261,ACT V.,_Ulr._    But I'll aid you now.
21262,ACT V.,
21263,ACT V.,_Sieg._                        In what?
21264,ACT V.,
21265,ACT V.,"_Ulr._ In searching for this man, or----When he's found,"
21266,ACT V.,What shall we do with him?
21267,ACT V.,
21268,ACT V.,_Sieg._                   I know not that.
21269,ACT V.,
21270,ACT V.,_Ulr._ Then wherefore seek?
21271,ACT V.,
21272,ACT V.,_Sieg._                     Because I cannot rest
21273,ACT V.,"Till he is found. His fate, and Stralenheim's,"
21274,ACT V.,"And ours, seem intertwisted! nor can be"
21275,ACT V.,"Unravelled, till----"
21276,ACT V.,
21277,ACT V.,_Enter an_ ATTENDANT.
21278,ACT V.,
21279,ACT V.,_Atten._            A stranger to wait on
21280,ACT V.,Your Excellency.
21281,ACT V.,
21282,ACT V.,_Sieg._         Who?
21283,ACT V.,
21284,ACT V.,_Atten._            He gave no name.
21285,ACT V.,
21286,ACT V.,"_Sieg._ Admit him, ne'ertheless."
21287,ACT V.,"[_The_ ATTENDANT _introduces_ GABOR, _and afterwards exit_."
21288,ACT V.,Ah!
21289,ACT V.,
21290,ACT V.,_Gab._                             'Tis then Werner!
21291,ACT V.,
21292,ACT V.,_Sieg._ (_haughtily_).
21293,ACT V.,"The same you knew, sir, by that name; and _you!_                   150"
21294,ACT V.,
21295,ACT V.,_Gab._ (_looking round_).
21296,ACT V.,"I recognise you both: father and son,"
21297,ACT V.,"It seems. Count, I have heard that you, or yours,"
21298,ACT V.,Have lately been in search of me: I am here.
21299,ACT V.,
21300,ACT V.,"_Sieg._ I have sought you, and have found you: you are charged"
21301,ACT V.,(Your own heart may inform you why) with such
21302,ACT V.,A crime as----                                           [_He pauses_.
21303,ACT V.,
21304,ACT V.,"_Gab._       Give it utterance, and then"
21305,ACT V.,I'll meet the consequences.
21306,ACT V.,
21307,ACT V.,_Sieg._                    You shall do so--
21308,ACT V.,Unless----
21309,ACT V.,
21310,ACT V.,"_Gab._ First, who accuses me?"
21311,ACT V.,
21312,ACT V.,"_Sieg._                       All things,"
21313,ACT V.,If not all men: the universal rumour--
21314,ACT V.,My own presence on the spot--the place--the time--                 160
21315,ACT V.,And every speck of circumstance unite
21316,ACT V.,To fix the blot on you.
21317,ACT V.,
21318,ACT V.,_Gab._                 And on _me only?_
21319,ACT V.,"Pause ere you answer: is no other name,"
21320,ACT V.,"Save mine, stained in this business?"
21321,ACT V.,
21322,ACT V.,_Sieg._                             Trifling villain!
21323,ACT V.,Who play'st with thine own guilt! Of all that breathe
21324,ACT V.,Thou best dost know the innocence of him
21325,ACT V.,'Gainst whom thy breath would blow thy bloody slander.
21326,ACT V.,"But I will talk no further with a wretch,"
21327,ACT V.,"Further than justice asks. Answer at once,"
21328,ACT V.,"And without quibbling, to my charge."
21329,ACT V.,
21330,ACT V.,_Gab._                              'Tis false!                    170
21331,ACT V.,
21332,ACT V.,_Sieg._ Who says so?
21333,ACT V.,
21334,ACT V.,_Gab._               I.
21335,ACT V.,
21336,ACT V.,_Sieg._                And how disprove it?
21337,ACT V.,
21338,ACT V.,_Gab._                                     By
21339,ACT V.,The presence of the murderer.
21340,ACT V.,
21341,ACT V.,_Sieg._                      Name him.
21342,ACT V.,
21343,ACT V.,_Gab._                                He
21344,ACT V.,May have more names than one. Your Lordship had so
21345,ACT V.,Once on a time.
21346,ACT V.,
21347,ACT V.,"_Sieg._         If you mean me, I dare"
21348,ACT V.,Your utmost.
21349,ACT V.,
21350,ACT V.,"_Gab._       You may do so, and in safety;"
21351,ACT V.,I know the assassin.
21352,ACT V.,
21353,ACT V.,_Sieg._              Where is he?
21354,ACT V.,
21355,ACT V.,_Gab._ (_pointing to_ ULRIC).         Beside you!
21356,ACT V.,[ULRIC _rushes forward to attack_ GABOR; SIEGENDORF _interposes_.
21357,ACT V.,
21358,ACT V.,_Sieg._ Liar and fiend! but you shall not be slain;
21359,ACT V.,"These walls are mine, and you are safe within them."
21360,ACT V.,"Ulric, repel this calumny, as I                  [_He turns to_ ULRIC."
21361,ACT V.,"Will do. I avow it is a growth so monstrous,                       180"
21362,ACT V.,I could not deem it earth-born: but be calm;
21363,ACT V.,It will refute itself. But touch him not.
21364,ACT V.,[ULRIC _endeavours to compose himself_.
21365,ACT V.,
21366,ACT V.,"_Gab._ Look at _him_, Count, and then _hear me_."
21367,ACT V.,
21368,ACT V.,"_Sieg._ (_first to_ GABOR, _and then looking at_ ULRIC)."
21369,ACT V.,I hear thee.
21370,ACT V.,My God! you look----
21371,ACT V.,
21372,ACT V.,_Ulr._              How?
21373,ACT V.,
21374,ACT V.,"_Sieg._                 As on that dread night,"
21375,ACT V.,When we met in the garden.
21376,ACT V.,
21377,ACT V.,_Ulr._ (_composing himself_). It is nothing.
21378,ACT V.,
21379,ACT V.,"_Gab._ Count, you are bound to hear me. I came hither"
21380,ACT V.,"Not seeking you, but sought. When I knelt down"
21381,ACT V.,"Amidst the people in the church, I dreamed not"
21382,ACT V.,To find the beggared Werner in the seat
21383,ACT V.,"Of Senators and Princes; but you have called me,                   190"
21384,ACT V.,And we have met.
21385,ACT V.,
21386,ACT V.,"_Sieg._          Go on, sir."
21387,ACT V.,
21388,ACT V.,"_Gab._                      Ere I do so,"
21389,ACT V.,"Allow me to inquire, who profited"
21390,ACT V.,By Stralenheim's death? Was't I--as poor as ever;
21391,ACT V.,And poorer by suspicion on my name!
21392,ACT V.,The Baron lost in that last outrage neither
21393,ACT V.,Jewels nor gold; his life alone was sought.--
21394,ACT V.,A life which stood between the claims of others
21395,ACT V.,To honours and estates scarce less than princely.
21396,ACT V.,
21397,ACT V.,"_Sieg._ These hints, as vague as vain, attach no less"
21398,ACT V.,To me than to my son.
21399,ACT V.,
21400,ACT V.,_Gab._                I can't help that.                           200
21401,ACT V.,But let the consequence alight on him
21402,ACT V.,Who feels himself the guilty one amongst us.
21403,ACT V.,"I speak to you, Count Siegendorf, because"
21404,ACT V.,"I know you innocent, and deem you just."
21405,ACT V.,But ere I can proceed--_dare_ you protect me?
21406,ACT V.,_Dare_ you command me?
21407,ACT V.,
21408,ACT V.,"[SIEGENDORF _first looks at the Hungarian, and then at_"
21409,ACT V.,"ULRIC, _who has unbuckled his sabre, and is drawing"
21410,ACT V.,lines with it on the floor--still in its sheath_.
21411,ACT V.,
21412,ACT V.,"_Ulr._ (_looks at his father, and says_,) Let the man go on!"
21413,ACT V.,
21414,ACT V.,"_Gab._ I am unarmed, Count, bid your son lay down"
21415,ACT V.,His sabre.
21416,ACT V.,
21417,ACT V.,_Ulr._ (_offers it to him contemptuously_). Take it.
21418,ACT V.,
21419,ACT V.,"_Gab._                                            No, sir, 'tis enough"
21420,ACT V.,That we are both unarmed--I would not choose
21421,ACT V.,To wear a steel which may be stained with more                     210
21422,ACT V.,Blood than came there in battle.
21423,ACT V.,
21424,ACT V.,_Ulr._ (_casts the sabre from him in contempt_). It--or some
21425,ACT V.,Such other weapon in my hand--spared yours
21426,ACT V.,"Once, when disarmed and at my mercy."
21427,ACT V.,
21428,ACT V.,_Gab._                              True--
21429,ACT V.,I have not forgotten it: you spared me for
21430,ACT V.,Your own especial purpose--to sustain
21431,ACT V.,An ignominy not my own.
21432,ACT V.,
21433,ACT V.,_Ulr._                  Proceed.
21434,ACT V.,The tale is doubtless worthy the relater.
21435,ACT V.,But is it of my father to hear further?              [_To_ SIEGENDORF.
21436,ACT V.,
21437,ACT V.,_Sieg._ (_takes his son by the hand_).
21438,ACT V.,"My son, I know my own innocence, and doubt not"
21439,ACT V.,Of yours--but I have promised this man patience;                   220
21440,ACT V.,Let him continue.
21441,ACT V.,
21442,ACT V.,"_Gab._            I will not detain you,"
21443,ACT V.,By speaking of myself much: I began
21444,ACT V.,Life early--and am what the world has made me.
21445,ACT V.,"At Frankfort on the Oder, where I passed"
21446,ACT V.,"A winter in obscurity, it was"
21447,ACT V.,My chance at several places of resort
21448,ACT V.,"(Which I frequented sometimes, but not often)"
21449,ACT V.,To hear related a strange circumstance
21450,ACT V.,"In February last. A martial force,"
21451,ACT V.,"Sent by the state, had, after strong resistance,                   230"
21452,ACT V.,"Secured a band of desperate men, supposed"
21453,ACT V.,"Marauders from the hostile camp.--They proved,"
21454,ACT V.,"However, not to be so--but banditti,"
21455,ACT V.,Whom either accident or enterprise
21456,ACT V.,Had carried from their usual haunt--the forests
21457,ACT V.,Which skirt Bohemia--even into Lusatia.
21458,ACT V.,Many amongst them were reported of
21459,ACT V.,High rank--and martial law slept for a time.
21460,ACT V.,"At last they were escorted o'er the frontiers,"
21461,ACT V.,And placed beneath the civil jurisdiction                          240
21462,ACT V.,Of the free town of Frankfort. Of _their_ fate
21463,ACT V.,I know no more.
21464,ACT V.,
21465,ACT V.,_Sieg._         And what is this to Ulric?
21466,ACT V.,
21467,ACT V.,_Gab._ Amongst them there was said to be one man
21468,ACT V.,"Of wonderful endowments:--birth and fortune,"
21469,ACT V.,"Youth, strength, and beauty, almost superhuman,"
21470,ACT V.,"And courage as unrivalled, were proclaimed"
21471,ACT V.,"His by the public rumour; and his sway,"
21472,ACT V.,"Not only over his associates, but"
21473,ACT V.,"His judges, was attributed to witchcraft,"
21474,ACT V.,Such was his influence:--I have no great faith                     250
21475,ACT V.,In any magic save that of the mine--
21476,ACT V.,I therefore deemed him wealthy.--But my soul
21477,ACT V.,Was roused with various feelings to seek out
21478,ACT V.,"This prodigy, if only to behold him."
21479,ACT V.,
21480,ACT V.,_Sieg._ And did you so?
21481,ACT V.,
21482,ACT V.,_Gab._                  You'll hear. Chance favoured me:
21483,ACT V.,A popular affray in the public square
21484,ACT V.,Drew crowds together--it was one of those
21485,ACT V.,"Occasions where men's souls look out of them,"
21486,ACT V.,And show them as they are--even in their faces:
21487,ACT V.,"The moment my eye met his, I exclaimed,                            260"
21488,ACT V.,"""This is the man!"" though he was then, as since,"
21489,ACT V.,With the nobles of the city. I felt sure
21490,ACT V.,"I had not erred, and watched him long and nearly;"
21491,ACT V.,"I noted down his form--his gesture--features,"
21492,ACT V.,"Stature, and bearing--and amidst them all,"
21493,ACT V.,"'Midst every natural and acquired distinction,"
21494,ACT V.,"I could discern, methought, the assassin's eye"
21495,ACT V.,And gladiator's heart.
21496,ACT V.,
21497,ACT V.,_Ulr._ (_smiling_). The tale sounds well.
21498,ACT V.,
21499,ACT V.,_Gab._ And may sound better.--He appeared to me
21500,ACT V.,"One of those beings to whom Fortune bends,                         270"
21501,ACT V.,As she doth to the daring--and on whom
21502,ACT V.,"The fates of others oft depend; besides,"
21503,ACT V.,An indescribable sensation drew me
21504,ACT V.,"Near to this man, as if my point of fortune"
21505,ACT V.,Was to be fixed by him.--There I was wrong.
21506,ACT V.,
21507,ACT V.,_Sieg._ And may not be right now.
21508,ACT V.,
21509,ACT V.,"_Gab._                            I followed him,"
21510,ACT V.,Solicited his notice--and obtained it--
21511,ACT V.,Though not his friendship:--it was his intention
21512,ACT V.,To leave the city privately--we left it
21513,ACT V.,Together--and together we arrived                                  280
21514,ACT V.,"In the poor town where Werner was concealed,"
21515,ACT V.,And Stralenheim was succoured----Now we are on
21516,ACT V.,The verge--_dare_ you hear further?
21517,ACT V.,
21518,ACT V.,_Sieg._                             I must do so--
21519,ACT V.,Or I have heard too much.
21520,ACT V.,
21521,ACT V.,_Gab._                   I saw in you
21522,ACT V.,A man above his station--and if not
21523,ACT V.,"So high, as now I find you, in my then"
21524,ACT V.,"Conceptions, 'twas that I had rarely seen"
21525,ACT V.,"Men such as you appeared in height of mind,"
21526,ACT V.,In the most high of worldly rank; you were
21527,ACT V.,"Poor, even to all save rags: I would have shared                   290"
21528,ACT V.,"My purse, though slender, with you--you refused it."
21529,ACT V.,
21530,ACT V.,"_Sieg._ Doth my refusal make a debt to you,"
21531,ACT V.,That thus you urge it?
21532,ACT V.,
21533,ACT V.,"_Gab._                 Still you owe me something,"
21534,ACT V.,"Though not for that; and I owed you my safety,"
21535,ACT V.,"At least my seeming safety, when the slaves"
21536,ACT V.,Of Stralenheim pursued me on the grounds
21537,ACT V.,That _I_ had robbed him.
21538,ACT V.,
21539,ACT V.,"_Sieg._                  _I_ concealed you--I,"
21540,ACT V.,"Whom and whose house you arraign, reviving viper!"
21541,ACT V.,
21542,ACT V.,_Gab._ I accuse no man--save in my defence.
21543,ACT V.,"You, Count, have made yourself accuser--judge:                     300"
21544,ACT V.,"Your hall's my court, your heart is my tribunal."
21545,ACT V.,"Be just, and _I'll_ be merciful!"
21546,ACT V.,
21547,ACT V.,_Sieg._                          You merciful?--
21548,ACT V.,You! Base calumniator!
21549,ACT V.,
21550,ACT V.,_Gab._                 I. 'Twill rest
21551,ACT V.,With me at last to be so. You concealed me--
21552,ACT V.,"In secret passages known to yourself,"
21553,ACT V.,"You said, and to none else. At dead of night,"
21554,ACT V.,"Weary with watching in the dark, and dubious"
21555,ACT V.,"Of tracing back my way, I saw a glimmer,"
21556,ACT V.,"Through distant crannies, of a twinkling light:"
21557,ACT V.,"I followed it, and reached a door--a secret                        310"
21558,ACT V.,"Portal--which opened to the chamber, where,"
21559,ACT V.,"With cautious hand and slow, having first undone"
21560,ACT V.,"As much as made a crevice of the fastening,"
21561,ACT V.,"I looked through and beheld a purple bed,"
21562,ACT V.,And on it Stralenheim!--
21563,ACT V.,
21564,ACT V.,_Sieg._                  Asleep! And yet
21565,ACT V.,You slew him!--Wretch!
21566,ACT V.,
21567,ACT V.,"_Gab._                He was already slain,"
21568,ACT V.,And bleeding like a sacrifice. My own
21569,ACT V.,Blood became ice.
21570,ACT V.,
21571,ACT V.,_Sieg._           But he was all alone!
21572,ACT V.,You saw none else? You did not see the----
21573,ACT V.,[_He pauses from agitation_.
21574,ACT V.,
21575,ACT V.,"_Gab._                                    No,"
21576,ACT V.,"_He_, whom you dare not name, nor even I                           320"
21577,ACT V.,"Scarce dare to recollect, was not then in"
21578,ACT V.,The chamber.
21579,ACT V.,
21580,ACT V.,"_Sieg._ (_to_ ULRIC). Then, my boy! thou art guiltless still--"
21581,ACT V.,Thou bad'st me say _I_ was so once.--Oh! now
21582,ACT V.,Do thou as much.
21583,ACT V.,
21584,ACT V.,_Gab._           Be patient! I can _not_
21585,ACT V.,"Recede now, though it shake the very walls"
21586,ACT V.,"Which frown above us. You remember,--or"
21587,ACT V.,"If not, your son does,--that the locks were changed"
21588,ACT V.,Beneath _his_ chief inspection on the morn
21589,ACT V.,Which led to this same night: how he had entered
21590,ACT V.,"He best knows--but within an antechamber,                          330"
21591,ACT V.,"The door of which was half ajar, I saw"
21592,ACT V.,"A man who washed his bloody hands, and oft"
21593,ACT V.,With stern and anxious glance gazed back upon--
21594,ACT V.,The bleeding body--but it moved no more.
21595,ACT V.,
21596,ACT V.,_Sieg._ Oh! God of fathers!
21597,ACT V.,
21598,ACT V.,_Gab._                      I beheld his features
21599,ACT V.,"As I see yours--but yours they were not, though"
21600,ACT V.,Resembling them--behold them in Count Ulric's!
21601,ACT V.,"Distinct as I beheld them, though the expression"
21602,ACT V.,Is not now what it then was!--but it was so
21603,ACT V.,When I first charged him with the crime--so lately.                340
21604,ACT V.,
21605,ACT V.,_Sieg._ This is so--
21606,ACT V.,
21607,ACT V.,_Gab._ (_interrupting him_). Nay--but hear me to the end!
21608,ACT V.,_Now_ you must do so.--I conceived myself
21609,ACT V.,Betrayed by you and _him_ (for now I saw
21610,ACT V.,There was some tie between you) into this
21611,ACT V.,"Pretended den of refuge, to become"
21612,ACT V.,The victim of your guilt; and my first thought
21613,ACT V.,Was vengeance: but though armed with a short poniard
21614,ACT V.,"(Having left my sword without), I was no match"
21615,ACT V.,"For him at any time, as had been proved"
21616,ACT V.,That morning--either in address or force.                          350
21617,ACT V.,I turned and fled--i' the dark: chance rather than
21618,ACT V.,"Skill made me gain the secret door of the hall,"
21619,ACT V.,And thence the chamber where you slept: if I
21620,ACT V.,"Had found you _waking_, Heaven alone can tell"
21621,ACT V.,What vengeance and suspicion might have prompted;
21622,ACT V.,But ne'er slept guilt as Werner slept that night.
21623,ACT V.,
21624,ACT V.,"_Sieg._ And yet I had horrid dreams! and such brief sleep,"
21625,ACT V.,The stars had not gone down when I awoke.
21626,ACT V.,Why didst thou spare me? I dreamt of my father--
21627,ACT V.,And now my dream is out!
21628,ACT V.,
21629,ACT V.,"_Gab._                  'Tis not my fault,                         360"
21630,ACT V.,If I have read it.--Well! I fled and hid me--
21631,ACT V.,Chance led me here after so many moons--
21632,ACT V.,And showed me Werner in Count Siegendorf!
21633,ACT V.,"Werner, whom I had sought in huts in vain,"
21634,ACT V.,Inhabited the palace of a sovereign!
21635,ACT V.,You sought me and have found me--now you know
21636,ACT V.,"My secret, and may weigh its worth."
21637,ACT V.,
21638,ACT V.,_Sieg._ (_after a pause_).           Indeed!
21639,ACT V.,
21640,ACT V.,_Gab._ Is it revenge or justice which inspires
21641,ACT V.,Your meditation?
21642,ACT V.,
21643,ACT V.,_Sieg._         Neither--I was weighing
21644,ACT V.,The value of your secret.
21645,ACT V.,
21646,ACT V.,_Gab._                    You shall know it                        370
21647,ACT V.,"At once:--When you were poor, and I, though poor,"
21648,ACT V.,Rich enough to relieve such poverty
21649,ACT V.,"As might have envied mine, I offered you"
21650,ACT V.,My purse--you would not share it:--I'll be franker
21651,ACT V.,"With you: you are wealthy, noble, trusted by"
21652,ACT V.,The imperial powers--you understand me?
21653,ACT V.,
21654,ACT V.,_Sieg._                                 Yes.
21655,ACT V.,
21656,ACT V.,"_Gab._ Not quite. You think me venal, and scarce true:"
21657,ACT V.,"'Tis no less true, however, that my fortunes"
21658,ACT V.,Have made me both at present. You shall aid me:
21659,ACT V.,I would have aided you--and also have                              380
21660,ACT V.,Been somewhat damaged in my name to save
21661,ACT V.,Yours and your son's. Weigh well what I have said.
21662,ACT V.,
21663,ACT V.,_Sieg._ Dare you await the event of a few minutes'
21664,ACT V.,Deliberation?
21665,ACT V.,
21666,ACT V.,"_Gab._ (_casts his eyes on_ ULRIC, _who is"
21667,ACT V.,leaning against a pillar_).   If I should do so?
21668,ACT V.,
21669,ACT V.,_Sieg._ I pledge my life for yours. Withdraw into
21670,ACT V.,This tower.                                    [_Opens a turret-door_.
21671,ACT V.,
21672,ACT V.,_Gab._ (_hesitatingly_). This is the second _safe_ asylum
21673,ACT V.,You have offered me.
21674,ACT V.,
21675,ACT V.,_Sieg._             And was not the first so?
21676,ACT V.,
21677,ACT V.,_Gab._ I know not that even now--but will approve
21678,ACT V.,The second. I have still a further shield.--
21679,ACT V.,I did not enter Prague alone; and should I                         390
21680,ACT V.,"Be put to rest with Stralenheim, there are"
21681,ACT V.,Some tongues without will wag in my behalf.
21682,ACT V.,Be brief in your decision![200]
21683,ACT V.,
21684,ACT V.,_Sieg._                   I will be so.--
21685,ACT V.,My word is sacred and irrevocable

21772,ACT V.,With right and wrong; and now must only ponder
21773,ACT V.,"Upon effects, not causes. Stralenheim,"

21775,ACT V.,"I would have saved a peasant's or a dog's, I slew"

21793,ACT V.,And have within these very walls men who
21794,ACT V.,(Although you know them not) dare venture all things.

22348,ACT I.,SCENE I.--_A ruinous chateau on the Silesian frontier of Bohemia_.
22349,ACT I.,
22350,ACT I.,"_Josepha_. THE storm is at it's height--how the wind howls,"
22351,ACT I.,"Like an unearthly voice, through these lone chambers!"
22352,ACT I.,And the rain patters on the flapping casement
22353,ACT I.,Which quivers in it's frame--the night is starless--
22354,ACT I.,Yet cheerly Werner! still our hearts are warm:
22355,ACT I.,"The tempest is without, or should be so--"
22356,ACT I.,For we are sheltered here where Fortune's clouds
22357,ACT I.,May roll all harmless o'er us as the wrath
22358,ACT I.,"Of these wild elements that menace now,"
22359,ACT I.,Yet do not reach us.
22360,ACT I.,
22361,ACT I.,"_Werner_ (_without attending, and walking disturbedly,"
22362,ACT I.,"speaking to himself_). No--'Tis past--'tis blighted,                10"
22363,ACT I.,The last faint hope to which my withered fortune
22364,ACT I.,"Clung with a feeble and a fluttering grasp,"
22365,ACT I.,Yet clung convulsively--for twas the _last_--
22366,ACT I.,Is broken with the rest: would that my heart were!
22367,ACT I.,"But there is pride, and passion's war within,"
22368,ACT I.,"Which give my breast vitality to suffer,"
22369,ACT I.,As it hath suffered through long years till now.
22370,ACT I.,"My father's wrath extends beyond the grave,"
22371,ACT I.,And haunts me in the shape of Stralenheim!
22372,ACT I.,He revels in my fathers palace--I--                                 20
22373,ACT I.,Exiled--disherited--a nameless outcast!
22374,ACT I.,[_Werner pauses_.
22375,ACT I.,"My boy, too, where and what is he?--my father"
22376,ACT I.,Might well have limited his curse to me.
22377,ACT I.,"If that my heritage had passed to Ulric,"
22378,ACT I.,I had not mourned my own less happy lot.
22379,ACT I.,No--No--all's past--all torn away.
22380,ACT I.,
22381,ACT I.,"_Josepha_.                        Dear Werner,"
22382,ACT I.,Oh banish these discomfortable thoughts
22383,ACT I.,"That thus contend within you: we are poor,"
22384,ACT I.,So we have ever been--but I remember
22385,ACT I.,The time when thy Josepha's smile could turn                        30
22386,ACT I.,Thy heart to hers--despite of every ill.
22387,ACT I.,So let it now--alas! you hear me not.
22388,ACT I.,
22389,ACT I.,_Werner_. What said you?--let it pass--no matter what--
22390,ACT I.,"Think me not churlish, Sweet, I am not well."
22391,ACT I.,My brain is hot and busy--long fatigue
22392,ACT I.,And last night's watching have oppressed me much.
22393,ACT I.,
22394,ACT I.,_Josepha_. Then get thee to thy couch. I do perceive
22395,ACT I.,In thy pale cheek and in thy bloodshot eye
22396,ACT I.,"A strange distemperature--nay, as a boon,"
22397,ACT I.,I do entreat thee to thy rest.
22398,ACT I.,
22399,ACT I.,_Werner_.                      My _rest!_                           40
22400,ACT I.,Well--be it so--Good Night!
22401,ACT I.,
22402,ACT I.,_Josepha_.                 Thy hand is burning;
22403,ACT I.,I will prepare a potion:--peace be with thee--
22404,ACT I.,Tomorrow's dawn I trust will find thee healthful;
22405,ACT I.,"And, then, our Ulric may perchance--"
22406,ACT I.,
22407,ACT I.,_Werner_. _Our_ Ulric--thine and mine--our only boy--
22408,ACT I.,Curse on his father and his father's Sire!
22409,ACT I.,"(For, if it is so, I will render back"
22410,ACT I.,"A curse that Heaven will hear as well as his),"
22411,ACT I.,"Our Ulric by his father's fault or folly,"

22413,ACT I.,"Is at this hour, perchance, undone. This night"
22414,ACT I.,That shelters us may shower it's wrath on him--

22417,ACT I.,Our Ulric--Woman!--I'll to no bed to-night--
22418,ACT I.,There is no pillow for my thoughts.
22419,ACT I.,
22420,ACT I.,"_Josepha_.                         What words,"
22421,ACT I.,What fearful words are these! what may they mean?
22422,ACT I.,
22423,ACT I.,"_Werner_. Look on me--thou hast known me, hitherto,"
22424,ACT I.,"As an oppressed, but yet a humble creature;"
22425,ACT I.,By birth predestined to the yoke I've borne.                        60
22426,ACT I.,"Till now I've borne it patiently, at least,"
22427,ACT I.,"In bitter silence--but the hour is come,"
22428,ACT I.,"That should and shall behold me as I was,"
22429,ACT I.,And ought again to be--
22430,ACT I.,
22431,ACT I.,_Josepha_.               I know not what
22432,ACT I.,"Thy mystery may tend to, but my fate--"
22433,ACT I.,"My heart--my will--my love are linked with thine,"
22434,ACT I.,And I would share thy sorrow: lay it open.
22435,ACT I.,
22436,ACT I.,_Werner_. Thou see'st the son of Count--but let it pass--
22437,ACT I.,I forfeited the name in wedding thee:
22438,ACT I.,That fault of many faults a father's pride                          70
22439,ACT I.,"Proclaimed the last and worst--and, from that hour,"
22440,ACT I.,"He disavowed, disherited, debased"
22441,ACT I.,A wayward son----tis a long tale--too long--
22442,ACT I.,And I am heartsick of the heavy thought.
22443,ACT I.,
22444,ACT I.,"_Josepha_. Oh, I could weep--but that were little solace:"
22445,ACT I.,"Yet tell the rest--or, if thou wilt not, say--"
22446,ACT I.,"Yet say--why, through long years, from me withheld,"
22447,ACT I.,This fearful secret that hath gnawed thy soul?
22448,ACT I.,
22449,ACT I.,_Werner_. Why? had it not been base to call on thee
22450,ACT I.,For patience and for pity--to awake                                 80
22451,ACT I.,The thirst of grandeur in thy gentle spirit--
22452,ACT I.,To tell thee what thou shouldst have been--the wife
22453,ACT I.,"Of one, in power--birth--wealth, preeminent--"
22454,ACT I.,"Then, sudden quailing in that lofty tone,"
22455,ACT I.,To bid thee soothe thy husband--peasant Werner?
22456,ACT I.,
22457,ACT I.,"_Josepha_. I would thou wert, indeed, the peasant Werner;"
22458,ACT I.,"For then thy soul had been of calmer mould,"
22459,ACT I.,And suited to thy lot----
22460,ACT I.,
22461,ACT I.,_Werner_.                 Was it not so?
22462,ACT I.,Beneath a humble name and garb--the which
22463,ACT I.,"My youthful riot and a father's frown,                              90"
22464,ACT I.,"Too justly fixed upon me, had compelled"
22465,ACT I.,My bowed down spirit to assume too well--
22466,ACT I.,"Since it deceived the world, myself, and thee:"
22467,ACT I.,I linked my lot irrevocably with thine--
22468,ACT I.,And I have loved thee deeply--long and dearly--
22469,ACT I.,"Even as I love thee still--but these late crosses,"
22470,ACT I.,"And most of all the last,--have maddened me;"
22471,ACT I.,"And I am wild and wayward as in youth,"
22472,ACT I.,Ere I beheld thee--
22473,ACT I.,
22474,ACT I.,_Josepha_.          Would thou never hadst!
22475,ACT I.,"Since I have been a blight upon thy hope,                          100"
22476,ACT I.,And marred alike the present and the future.
22477,ACT I.,
22478,ACT I.,_Werner_. Yet say not so--for all that I have known
22479,ACT I.,Of true and calm content--of love--of peace--
22480,ACT I.,"Has been with thee and from thee: wert thou not,"
22481,ACT I.,I were a lonely and self-loathing thing.
22482,ACT I.,"Ulric has left us! all, save thou, have left me!"
22483,ACT I.,Father and son--Fortune--Fame--Power--Ambition--
22484,ACT I.,The ties of being--the high soul of man--
22485,ACT I.,"All save the long remorse--the consciousness,"
22486,ACT I.,"The curse of living on, regretting life                            110"
22487,ACT I.,"Mispent in miserably gazing upward,"
22488,ACT I.,"While others soared--Away, I'll think no more."
22489,ACT I.,
22490,ACT I.,_Josepha_. But Ulric--wherefore didst thou let him leave
22491,ACT I.,His home and us? tis now three weary years.
22492,ACT I.,
22493,ACT I.,_Werner_ (_interrupting her quickly_).
22494,ACT I.,"Since my hard father, half-relenting, sent"
22495,ACT I.,The offer of a scanty stipend which
22496,ACT I.,I needs must earn by rendering up my son--
22497,ACT I.,"Fool that I was--I thought this quick compliance,"
22498,ACT I.,And never more assuming in myself
22499,ACT I.,The haught name of my house would soften him--                     120
22500,ACT I.,And for our child secure the heritage
22501,ACT I.,"Forfeit in me forever. Since that hour,"
22502,ACT I.,"Till the last year, the wretched pittance came--"
22503,ACT I.,Then ceased with every tidings of my son
22504,ACT I.,And Sire--till late I heard the last had ceased
22505,ACT I.,To live--and unforgiving died--Oh God!
22506,ACT I.,
22507,ACT I.,_Josepha_. Was it for this our Ulric left us so?
22508,ACT I.,Thou dids't deceive me then--he went not forth
22509,ACT I.,To join the legions of Count Tilly's war?
22510,ACT I.,
22511,ACT I.,"_Werner_. I know not--he had left my father's castle,              130"
22512,ACT I.,Some months before his death--but why?--but why?
22513,ACT I.,"Left it as I did ere his birth, perchance,"
22514,ACT I.,Like me an outcast. Old age had not made
22515,ACT I.,"My father meeker--and my son, Alas!"
22516,ACT I.,Too much his Sire resembled----
22517,ACT I.,
22518,ACT I.,_Josepha_.                     Yet there's comfort.
22519,ACT I.,Restrain thy wandering Spirit--Ulric cannot
22520,ACT I.,"Have left his native land--thou dost not know,"
22521,ACT I.,"Though it looks strangely, thy Sire and he"
22522,ACT I.,In anger parted--Hope is left us still.
22523,ACT I.,
22524,ACT I.,"_Werner_. The best hope that I ever held in youth,                 140"
22525,ACT I.,"When every pulse was life, each thought a joy,"
22526,ACT I.,"(Yet not irrationally sanguine, since"
22527,ACT I.,"My birth bespoke high thoughts,) hath lured and left me."
22528,ACT I.,I will not be a dreamer in mine age--
22529,ACT I.,The hunter of a shadow--let _boys hope_:
22530,ACT I.,Of Hope I now know nothing but the name--
22531,ACT I.,And that's a sound which jars upon my heart.
22532,ACT I.,I've wearied thee--Good night--my patient Love!
22533,ACT I.,
22534,ACT I.,_Josepha_. I must not leave thee thus--my husband--friend--
22535,ACT I.,My heart is rent in twain for thee--I scarce                       150
22536,ACT I.,"Dare greet thee as I would, lest that my love"
22537,ACT I.,Should seem officious and ill timed:--'tis early--
22538,ACT I.,Yet rest were as a healing balm to thee--
22539,ACT I.,Then once again--Good night!
22540,ACT I.,
22541,ACT I.,_Voice Without_.             What Ho--lights ho!

22547,SCENE II.,[_A knocking heard at the gate_--WERNER _starts_.
22548,SCENE II.,
22549,SCENE II.,"_Werner_ (_aside_). It may be that the bloodhounds of the villain,"
22550,SCENE II.,"Who long has tracked me, have approached at last:"
22551,SCENE II.,I'll not be taken tamely.
22552,SCENE II.,
22553,SCENE II.,"_Josepha_.                'Twas the voice,"
22554,SCENE II.,The single voice of some lone traveller.
22555,SCENE II.,I'll to the door.
22556,SCENE II.,
22557,SCENE II.,_Werner_.         No--stay thou here--again!
22558,SCENE II.,[_Knocking repeated. Opens the door_.
22559,SCENE II.,Well--Sir--your pleasure?
22560,SCENE II.,
22561,SCENE II.,_Enter_ CARL _the Bavarian_.
22562,SCENE II.,
22563,SCENE II.,_Carl_.                   Thanks most worthy Sir!
22564,SCENE II.,"My pleasure, for to-night, depends on yours--"
22565,SCENE II.,"I'm weary, wet, and wayworn--without shelter,"
22566,SCENE II.,Unless you please to grant it.
22567,SCENE II.,
22568,SCENE II.,"_Josepha_.                    You shall have it,                    10"
22569,SCENE II.,Such as this ruinous mansion may afford:
22570,SCENE II.,"Tis spacious, but too cold and crazy now"
22571,SCENE II.,For Hospitality's more cordial welcome:
22572,SCENE II.,But as it is 'tis yours.
22573,SCENE II.,
22574,SCENE II.,_Werner_ (_to his wife_).   Why say ye so?
22575,SCENE II.,At once such hearty greeting to a stranger?
22576,SCENE II.,"At such a lonely hour, too--"
22577,SCENE II.,
22578,SCENE II.,_Josepha_ (_in reply to Werner_). Nay--he's honest.
22579,SCENE II.,There is trust-worthiness in his blunt looks.
22580,SCENE II.,
22581,SCENE II.,_Werner_ (_to Josepha_).
22582,SCENE II.,"""Trustworthiness in looks!"" I'll trust no looks!"
22583,SCENE II.,"I look into men's faces for their age,"
22584,SCENE II.,"Not for their actions--had he Adam's brow,                          20"
22585,SCENE II.,"Open and goodly as before the fall,"
22586,SCENE II.,I've lived too long to trust the frankest aspect.
22587,SCENE II.,(_To Carl_) Whence come you Sir?
22588,SCENE II.,
22589,SCENE II.,"_Carl_.                         From Frankfort, on my way"
22590,SCENE II.,To my own country--I've a companion too--
22591,SCENE II.,"He tarries now behind:--an hour ago,"
22592,SCENE II.,"On reaching that same river on your frontier,"
22593,SCENE II.,"We found it swoln by storms--a stranger's carriage,"
22594,SCENE II.,"Despite the current, drawn by sturdy mules,"
22595,SCENE II.,"Essayed to pass, and nearly reached the middle"
22596,SCENE II.,"Of that which was the _ford_ in gentler weather,                    30"
22597,SCENE II.,"When down came driver, carriage, mules, and all--"
22598,SCENE II.,You may suppose the worthy Lord within
22599,SCENE II.,"Fared ill enough:--worse still he might have suffered,"
22600,SCENE II.,"But that my comrade and myself rushed in,"
22601,SCENE II.,"And with main strength and some good luck beside,"
22602,SCENE II.,Dislodged and saved him: he'll be here anon.
22603,SCENE II.,His equipage by this time is at Dresden--
22604,SCENE II.,I left it floating that way.
22605,SCENE II.,
22606,SCENE II.,_Werner_.                   Where is he?
22607,SCENE II.,
22608,SCENE II.,"_Carl_. Hitherward on his way, even like myself--"
22609,SCENE II.,We saw the light and made for the nearest shelter:                  40
22610,SCENE II.,You'll not deny us for a single night?
22611,SCENE II.,"You've room enough, methinks--and this vast ruin"
22612,SCENE II.,Will not be worse for three more guests.
22613,SCENE II.,
22614,SCENE II.,_Werner_.                               Two more:
22615,SCENE II.,And thou?--well--be it so--(_aside_) (tonight will soon
22616,SCENE II.,Be overpast: they shall not stay tomorrow)--
22617,SCENE II.,Know you the name of him you saved?
22618,SCENE II.,
22619,SCENE II.,_Carl_.                             Not I!
22620,SCENE II.,I think I heard him called a Baron Something--
22621,SCENE II.,But was too chill to stay and hear his titles:
22622,SCENE II.,"You know they are sometimes tedious in the reckoning,"
22623,SCENE II.,If counted over by the noble wearer.                                50
22624,SCENE II.,"Has't any wine? I'm wet, stung to the marrow--"
22625,SCENE II.,My comrade waited to escort the Baron:
22626,SCENE II.,"They will be here, anon--they, too, want cheering:"
22627,SCENE II.,"I'll taste for them, if it please you, courteous host!"
22628,SCENE II.,
22629,SCENE II.,_Josepha_. Such as our vintage is shall give you welcome:
22630,SCENE II.,I'll bring you some anon.                                 [_goes out_.
22631,SCENE II.,
22632,SCENE II.,_Carl_ (_looking round_). A goodly mansion!
22633,SCENE II.,"And has been nobly tenanted, I doubt not."
22634,SCENE II.,This worn magnificence some day has shone
22635,SCENE II.,On light hearts and long revels--those torn banners
22636,SCENE II.,Have waved o'er courtly guests--and yon huge lamp                   60
22637,SCENE II.,High blazed through many a midnight--I could wish
22638,SCENE II.,My lot had led me here in those gay times!
22639,SCENE II.,"Your days, my host, must pass but heavily."
22640,SCENE II.,"Are you the vassal of these antient chiefs,"
22641,SCENE II.,"Whose heir wastes elsewhere their fast melting hoards,"
22642,SCENE II.,And placed to keep their cobwebs company?
22643,SCENE II.,
22644,SCENE II.,_Werner_ (_who has been absorbed in thought till the latter
22645,SCENE II.,part of his speech_). A Vassal!--I a vassal!--_who_ accosts me
22646,SCENE II.,With such familiar question?--(_checks himself and says
22647,SCENE II.,aside_)--Down startled pride!
22648,SCENE II.,"Have not long years of wretchedness yet quenched thee,"
22649,SCENE II.,"And, suffering evil, wilt thou start at scorn?                      70"
22650,SCENE II.,"(_To Carl_.) Sir! if I boast no birth--and, as you see,"
22651,SCENE II.,"My state bespeaks none--still, no being breathes"
22652,SCENE II.,Who calls me slave or servant.--Like yourself
22653,SCENE II.,I am a stranger here--a lonely guest--
22654,SCENE II.,"But, for a time, on sufferance. On my way,"
22655,SCENE II.,"From--a far distant city--Sickness seized,"
22656,SCENE II.,And long detained me in the neighbouring hamlet.
22657,SCENE II.,"The Intendant of the owner of this castle,"
22658,SCENE II.,"Then uninhabited, with kind intent,"
22659,SCENE II.,Permitted me to wait returning health                               80
22660,SCENE II.,Within these walls--more sheltered than the cot
22661,SCENE II.,Of humble peasants.
22662,SCENE II.,
22663,SCENE II.,"_Carl_.             Worthy Sir, your mercy!"
22664,SCENE II.,"I meant not to offend you--plain of speech,"
22665,SCENE II.,"And blunt in apprehension, I do judge"
22666,SCENE II.,Men's station from their seeming--but themselves
22667,SCENE II.,"From acts alone. You bid me share your shelter,"
22668,SCENE II.,And I am bound to you; and had you been
22669,SCENE II.,"The lowliest vassal had not thanked you less,"
22670,SCENE II.,"Than I do now, believing you his better,"
22671,SCENE II.,Perhaps my own superior--
22672,SCENE II.,
22673,SCENE II.,_Werner_.                 What imports it?                          90
22674,SCENE II.,What--who I am--or whence--you are welcome--sit--
22675,SCENE II.,You shall have cheer anon. (_walks disturbedly aside_)
22676,SCENE II.,
22677,SCENE II.,_Carl_ (_to himself_). Here's a strange fellow!
22678,SCENE II.,"Wild, churlish, angry--_why_, I know not, seek not."
22679,SCENE II.,"Would that the wine were come! my doublet's wet,"
22680,SCENE II.,But my throat dry as Summer's drought in desarts.
22681,SCENE II.,Ah--here it sparkles!
22682,SCENE II.,
22683,SCENE II.,_Enter_ JOSEPHA _with wine in flask--and a cup. As she pours
22684,SCENE II.,it out a Voice is heard without calling at a distance_.
22685,SCENE II.,WERNER _starts_--JOSEPHA _listens tremulously_.
22686,SCENE II.,
22687,SCENE II.,_Werner_.            That voice--that voice--Hark!
22688,SCENE II.,No--no--tis silent--Sir--I say--that voice--
22689,SCENE II.,Whose is it--speak--
22690,SCENE II.,
22691,SCENE II.,_Carl_ (_drinking unconcernedly_).
22692,SCENE II.,"Whose is it? faith, I know not--"
22693,SCENE II.,"And, yet, 'tis my companion's: he's like you,"
22694,SCENE II.,And does not care to tell his name and station.                    100
22695,SCENE II.,[_The voice again and nearer_.
22696,SCENE II.,
22697,SCENE II.,_Josepha_. 'Tis his--I knew it--Ulric!--Ulric!--Ulric!
22698,SCENE II.,[_She drops the wine and rushes out_.
22699,SCENE II.,
22700,SCENE II.,_Carl_. The flask's unhurt--but every drop is spilt.
22701,SCENE II.,Confound the voice! I say--would he were dumb!
22702,SCENE II.,"And faith! to me, he has been nearly so--"
22703,SCENE II.,A silent and unsocial travelling mate.
22704,SCENE II.,
22705,SCENE II.,_Werner_ (_stands in agitation gazing towards the door_).
22706,SCENE II.,If it be he--I cannot move to meet him.
22707,SCENE II.,Yes--it must be so--there is no such voice
22708,SCENE II.,"That so could sound and shake me: he is here,"
22709,SCENE II.,And I am--
22710,SCENE II.,
22711,SCENE II.,_Enter_ STRALENHEIM.
22712,SCENE II.,
22713,SCENE II.,"_Werner_ (_turns and sees him_). A curse upon thee, stranger!"
22714,SCENE II.,Where dids't thou learn a tone so like my boy's?                   110
22715,SCENE II.,Thou mock bird of my hopes--a curse upon thee!
22716,SCENE II.,Out! Out! I say. Thou shalt not harbour here.
22717,SCENE II.,
22718,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_. What means the peasant? knows he unto whom
22719,SCENE II.,He dares address this language?
22720,SCENE II.,
22721,SCENE II.,_Carl_.                         Noble Sir!
22722,SCENE II.,"Pray heed him not--he's Phrenzy's next door neighbour,"
22723,SCENE II.,And full of these strange starts and causeless jarrings.
22724,SCENE II.,
22725,SCENE II.,"_Werner_. Oh, that long wished for voice!--I dreamed of it--"
22726,SCENE II.,And then it did elude me--then--and now.
22727,SCENE II.,
22728,SCENE II.,_Enter_ ULRIC _and_ JOSEPHA. WERNER _falls on his neck_.
22729,SCENE II.,
22730,SCENE II.,"Oh God! forgive, for thou dids't not forget me."
22731,SCENE II.,Although I murmured--tis--it is my Son!                            120
22732,SCENE II.,
22733,SCENE II.,"_Josepha_. Aye, 'tis dear Ulric--yet, methinks, he's changed, too:"
22734,SCENE II.,"His cheek is tanned, his frame more firmly knit!"
22735,SCENE II.,"That scar, too, dearest Ulric--I do fear me--"
22736,SCENE II.,"Thou hast been battling with these heretics,"
22737,SCENE II.,And that's a Swedish token on thy brow.
22738,SCENE II.,
22739,SCENE II.,_Ulric_. My heart is glad with yours--we meet like those
22740,SCENE II.,Who never would have parted:--of the past
22741,SCENE II.,"You shall know more anon--but, here's a guest"
22742,SCENE II.,"That asks a gentle welcome. Noble Baron,"
22743,SCENE II.,My father's silence looks discourtesy:                             130
22744,SCENE II.,Yet must I plead his pardon--'tis his love
22745,SCENE II.,"Of a long truant that has rapt him, thus,"
22746,SCENE II.,From hospitable greeting--you'll be seated--
22747,SCENE II.,"And, Father, we will sup like famished hunters."
22748,SCENE II.,
22749,SCENE II.,JOSEPHA _goes out here_.
22750,SCENE II.,
22751,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_. I have much need of rest: no more refreshment!
22752,SCENE II.,"Were all my people housed within the hamlet,"
22753,SCENE II.,Or can they follow?
22754,SCENE II.,
22755,SCENE II.,_Ulric_.           Not to night I fear.
22756,SCENE II.,They staid in hope the damaged Cabriole
22757,SCENE II.,"Might, with the dawn of day, have such repairs,"
22758,SCENE II.,As circumstance admits of.
22759,SCENE II.,
22760,SCENE II.,_Carl_.                    Nay--that's hopeless.                   140
22761,SCENE II.,They must not only mend but draw it too.
22762,SCENE II.,The mules are drowned--a murrain on them both!
22763,SCENE II.,One kicked me as I would have helped him on.
22764,SCENE II.,
22765,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_. It is most irksome to me--this delay.
22766,SCENE II.,I was for Prague on business of great moment.
22767,SCENE II.,
22768,SCENE II.,_Werner_. For Prague--Sir--Say you?--
22769,SCENE II.,
22770,SCENE II.,"_Stralenheim_.                        Yes, my host! for Prague."
22771,SCENE II.,And these vile floods and villainous cross roads
22772,SCENE II.,Steal my time from it's uses--but--my people?
22773,SCENE II.,Where do they shelter?
22774,SCENE II.,
22775,SCENE II.,"_Ulric_.               In the boatman's shed,"
22776,SCENE II.,Near to the ferry: you mistook the ford--                          150
22777,SCENE II.,Tis higher to the right:--their entertainment
22778,SCENE II.,"Will be but rough--but 'tis a single night,"
22779,SCENE II.,And they had best be guardians of the baggage.
22780,SCENE II.,"The shed will hold the weather from their sleep,"
22781,SCENE II.,"The woodfire warm them--and, for beds, a cloak"
22782,SCENE II.,Is swansdown to a seasoned traveller:
22783,SCENE II.,"It has been mine for many a moon, and may"
22784,SCENE II.,"Tonight, for aught it recks me."
22785,SCENE II.,
22786,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_.                  And tomorrow
22787,SCENE II.,I must be on my journey--and betimes.
22788,SCENE II.,"It is not more than three days travel, hence,                      160"
22789,SCENE II.,To Mansfeldt Castle.
22790,SCENE II.,
22791,SCENE II.,_Werner and Ulric_. Mansfeldt Castle!--
22792,SCENE II.,
22793,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_.                           Aye!
22794,SCENE II.,"For thither tends my progress--so, betimes,"
22795,SCENE II.,Mine host I would be stirring--think of that!
22796,SCENE II.,And let me find my couch of rest at present.
22797,SCENE II.,
22798,SCENE II.,_Werner_. You shall Sir--but--to Mansfeldt!--
22799,SCENE II.,"[ULRIC _stops his father and says aside to him_,"
22800,SCENE II.,_Silence--father--_
22801,SCENE II.,Whate'er it be that shakes you thus--_tread down_--
22802,SCENE II.,"(_To Stralenheim_) My father, Sir, was born not far from Prague,"
22803,SCENE II.,"And knows it's environs--and, when he hears,"
22804,SCENE II.,"The name endeared to him by native thoughts,"
22805,SCENE II.,"He would ask of it, and it's habitants--                           170"
22806,SCENE II.,You will excuse his plain blunt mode of question.
22807,SCENE II.,
22808,SCENE II.,"_Stralenheim_. Indeed, perchance, then, he may aid my search."
22809,SCENE II.,"Pray, know you aught of one named Werner? who"
22810,SCENE II.,"(But he no doubt has passed through many names),"
22811,SCENE II.,Lived long in Hamburgh--and has thence been traced
22812,SCENE II.,Into Silesia--and not far from hence--
22813,SCENE II.,But there we lost him; he who can disclose
22814,SCENE II.,"Aught of him, or his hiding-place, will find"
22815,SCENE II.,Advantage in revealing it.
22816,SCENE II.,
22817,SCENE II.,_Ulric_.                  Why so--Sir?
22818,SCENE II.,
22819,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_. There are strong reasons to suspect this man        180
22820,SCENE II.,Of crimes against the State--league with Swedes--
22821,SCENE II.,And other evil acts of moment:--he
22822,SCENE II.,"Who shall deliver him, bound hand and foot,"
22823,SCENE II.,Will benefit his country and himself:
22824,SCENE II.,I will reward him doubly too.
22825,SCENE II.,
22826,SCENE II.,_Ulric_.                      You know him?
22827,SCENE II.,
22828,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_. He never met my eyes--but Circumstance
22829,SCENE II.,Has led me to near knowledge of the man.
22830,SCENE II.,He is a villain--and an enemy
22831,SCENE II.,"To all men--most to me! If earth contain him,"
22832,SCENE II.,"He shall be found and fettered: I have hopes,                      190"
22833,SCENE II.,"By traces which tomorrow will unravel,"
22834,SCENE II.,A fresh clue to his lurking spot is nigh.
22835,SCENE II.,
22836,SCENE II.,"_Carl_. And, if I find it, I will break the thread."
22837,SCENE II.,"What, all the world against one luckless wight!"
22838,SCENE II.,And he a fugitive--I would I knew him!
22839,SCENE II.,
22840,SCENE II.,_Ulric_. You'd help him to escape--is it not so?
22841,SCENE II.,
22842,SCENE II.,"_Carl_. I would, indeed!"
22843,SCENE II.,
22844,SCENE II.,_Ulric_.                 The greater greenhorn you!
22845,SCENE II.,I would secure him--nay--I will do so.
22846,SCENE II.,
22847,SCENE II.,"_Stralenheim_. If it be so--my gratitude for aid,"
22848,SCENE II.,"And rescue of my life from the wild waters,                        200"
22849,SCENE II.,Will double in it's strength and it's requital.
22850,SCENE II.,"Your father, too, perhaps can help our search?"
22851,SCENE II.,
22852,SCENE II.,"_Werner_. _I_ turn a spy--no--not for _Mansfeldt Castle_,"
22853,SCENE II.,And all the broad domain it frowns upon.
22854,SCENE II.,
22855,SCENE II.,"_Stralenheim_. Mansfeldt again!--you know it then? perchance,"
22856,SCENE II.,You also know the story of it's lords?
22857,SCENE II.,
22858,SCENE II.,"_Werner_. Whate'er I know, there is no bribe of thine"
22859,SCENE II.,Can swerve me to the crooked path thou pointest.
22860,SCENE II.,"The chamber's ready, which your rest demands."
22861,SCENE II.,
22862,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_ (_aside_).
22863,SCENE II.,"'Tis strange--this peasant's tone is wondrous high,                210"
22864,SCENE II.,His air imperious--and his eye shines out
22865,SCENE II.,As wont to look command with a quick glance--
22866,SCENE II.,"His garb befits him not--why, he may be"
22867,SCENE II.,"The man I look for! now, I look again,"
22868,SCENE II.,There is the very lip--short curling lip--
22869,SCENE II.,"And the oerjutting eye-brow dark and large,"
22870,SCENE II.,And the peculiar wild variety
22871,SCENE II.,"Of feature, even unto the Viper's eye,"
22872,SCENE II.,"Of that detested race, and it's descendant"
22873,SCENE II.,"Who stands alone between me and a power,                           220"
22874,SCENE II.,Which Princes gaze at with unquiet eyes!
22875,SCENE II.,"This is no peasant--but, whate'er he be,"
22876,SCENE II.,Tomorrow shall secure him and unfold.
22877,SCENE II.,
22878,SCENE II.,"_Ulric_. It will not please you, Sir, then to remain"
22879,SCENE II.,With us beyond tomorrow?
22880,SCENE II.,
22881,SCENE II.,_Stralenheim_. Nay--I do not say so--there is no haste.
22882,SCENE II.,And now I think again--I'll tarry here--
22883,SCENE II.,Perhaps until the floods abate--we'll see--
22884,SCENE II.,In the mean time--to my chamber--so--Good Night!
22885,SCENE II.,[_Exit with_ WERNER.
22886,SCENE II.,
22887,SCENE II.,"_Werner_. This way, Sir."
22888,SCENE II.,
22889,SCENE II.,"_Carl_. And I to mine: pray, where are we to rest?                 230"
22890,SCENE II.,We'll sup within--
22891,SCENE II.,
22892,SCENE II.,_Ulric_.          What matter where--there's room.
22893,SCENE II.,
22894,SCENE II.,_Carl_. I would fain see my way through this vast ruin;
22895,SCENE II.,"Come take the lamp, and we'll explore together."
22896,SCENE II.,
22897,SCENE II.,_Josepha_ (_meeting them_). And I will with my son.
22898,SCENE II.,
22899,SCENE II.,_Ulric_.                          Nay--stay--dear mother!
22900,SCENE II.,These chilly damps and the cold rush of winds
22901,SCENE II.,Fling a rough paleness o'er thy delicate cheek--
22902,SCENE II.,And thou seem'st lovely in thy sickliness
22903,SCENE II.,Of most transparent beauty:--but it grieves me.
22904,SCENE II.,Nay! tarry here by the blaze of the bright hearth:--
22905,SCENE II.,I will return anon--and we have much                               240
22906,SCENE II.,"To listen and impart. Come, Carl, we'll find"
22907,SCENE II.,"Some gorgeous canopy, and, thence, unroost"
22908,SCENE II.,It's present bedfellows the bats--and thou
22909,SCENE II.,Shalt slumber underneath a velvet cloud
22910,SCENE II.,That mantles o'er the couch of some dead Countess.
22911,SCENE II.,[_Exit_ CARL _and_ ULRIC.
22912,SCENE II.,
22913,SCENE II.,_Josepha_ (_sola_). It was my joy to see him--nothing more
22914,SCENE II.,I should have said--which sent my gush of blood
22915,SCENE II.,Back on my full heart with a dancing tide:
22916,SCENE II.,"It was my weary hope's unthought fulfilment,"
22917,SCENE II.,My agony of mother-feelings curdled                                250
22918,SCENE II.,At once in gathered rapture--which did change
22919,SCENE II.,My cheek into the hue of fainting Nature.
22920,SCENE II.,I should have answered thus--and yet I could not:
22921,SCENE II.,For though 'twas true--it was not all the truth.
22922,SCENE II.,I have much suffered in the thought of Werner's
22923,SCENE II.,"Late deep distemperature of mind and fortunes,"
22924,SCENE II.,Which since have almost driven him into phrenzy:--
22925,SCENE II.,"And though that I would soothe, not share, such passions,"
22926,SCENE II.,"And show not how they shake me:--when alone,"
22927,SCENE II.,"I feel them prey upon me by reflection,                            260"
22928,SCENE II.,And want the very solace I bestowed;
22929,SCENE II.,"And which, it seems, I cannot give and have."
22930,SCENE II.,Ulric must be my comforter--his father's
22931,SCENE II.,Hath long been the most melancholy soul
22932,SCENE II.,That ever hovered o'er the verge of Madness:
22933,SCENE II.,"And, better, had he leapt into it's gulph:"
22934,SCENE II.,"Though to the Mad thoughts are realities,"
22935,SCENE II.,Yet they can play with sorrow--and live on.
22936,SCENE II.,But with the mind of consciousness and care
22937,SCENE II.,"The body wears to ruin, and the struggle,                          270"
22938,SCENE II.,"However long, is deadly----He is lost,"
22939,SCENE II.,And all around him tasteless:--in his mirth
22940,SCENE II.,"His very laughter moves me oft to tears,"
22941,SCENE II.,"And I have turned to hide them--for, in him,"
22942,SCENE II.,As Sunshine glittering o'er unburied bones----
22943,SCENE II.,Soft--he is here.----
22944,SCENE II.,
22945,SCENE II.,_Werner_.            Josepha--where is Ulric?
22946,SCENE II.,
22947,SCENE II.,_Josepha_. Gone with the other stranger to gaze o'er
22948,SCENE II.,"These shattered corridors, and spread themselves"
22949,SCENE II.,"A pillow with their mantles, in the least ruinous:"
22950,SCENE II.,I must replenish the diminished hearth                             280
22951,SCENE II.,"In the inner chamber--the repast is ready,"
22952,SCENE II.,And Ulric will be here again.--

23011,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,but by Joshua Pickersgill. A fellow-feeling lent an intimate and
23012,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,peculiar interest to the theme. He had suffered all his life from a
23013,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"painful and inconvenient defect, which his proud and sensitive spirit"
23014,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,had magnified into a deformity. He had been stung to the quick by his
23015,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"mother's taunts and his sweetheart's ridicule, by the jeers of the base"
23016,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"and thoughtless, by slanderous and brutal paragraphs in newspapers. He"
23017,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,could not forget that he was lame. If his enemies had but possessed the

23019,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"(letter to Moore, April 2, 1823, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 179). It was no"

23022,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"such a ""thorn in the flesh"" should picture to itself a mysterious and"
23023,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"unhallowed miracle of healing. It is true, as Moore says (_Life_, pp."
23024,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"45, 306), that ""the trifling deformity of his foot"" was the embittering"
23025,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"circumstance of his life, that it ""haunted him like a curse;"" but it by"
23026,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,no means follows that he seriously regarded his physical peculiarity as

23030,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"doubt he indulged himself in morbid fancies, played with the"
23031,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"extravagances of a restless imagination, and wedded them to verse; but"
23032,INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.,"his intellect, ""brooding like the day, a master o'er a slave,"" kept"

23261,PART I.,This knife! now let me prove if it will sever
23262,PART I.,This withered slip of Nature's nightshade--my

23274,PART I.,"So let them, for I would not be lamented:"
23275,PART I.,But let their merriest notes be Arnold's knell;
23276,PART I.,The fallen leaves my monument; the murmur

23280,PART I.,"[_As he rushes to throw himself upon the knife,"

23285,PART I.,The ripple of a spring change my resolve?
23286,PART I.,"No. Yet it moves again! The waters stir,"

23288,PART I.,And rocking Power of the internal world.

23300,PART I.,
23301,PART I.,"_Arn._          Your form is man's, and yet"
23302,PART I.,You may be devil.
23303,PART I.,
23304,PART I.,_Stran._         So many men are that
23305,PART I.,"Which is so called or thought, that you may add me"
23306,PART I.,"To which you please, without much wrong to either."
23307,PART I.,But come: you wish to kill yourself;--pursue

23309,PART I.,
23310,PART I.,_Arn._       You have interrupted me.
23311,PART I.,
23312,PART I.,_Stran._ What is that resolution which can e'er                     90

23322,PART I.,_Stran._      Unless you keep company
23323,PART I.,With him (and you seem scarce used to such high
23324,PART I.,Society) you can't tell how he approaches;
23325,PART I.,"And for his aspect, look upon the fountain,"
23326,PART I.,"And then on me, and judge which of us twain                        100"

23329,PART I.,
23330,PART I.,_Arn._                      Do you--dare _you_

23339,PART I.,And all the fierce and fair of the same kind                       110
23340,PART I.,With thee. Thy form is natural: 'twas only
23341,PART I.,Nature's mistaken largess to bestow
23342,PART I.,The gifts which are of others upon man.

23344,PART I.,"_Arn._ Give me the strength then of the buffalo's foot,[cw]"

23349,PART I.,Thy fiendish sarcasm with a saintly patience.
23350,PART I.,
23351,PART I.,_Stran._ I will.
23352,PART I.,
23353,PART I.,_Arn._ (_with surprise_). Thou _canst?_
23354,PART I.,
23355,PART I.,_Stran._                          Perhaps. Would you aught else?   120
23356,PART I.,
23357,PART I.,_Arn._ Thou mockest me.
23358,PART I.,
23359,PART I.,_Stran._                Not I. Why should I mock
23360,PART I.,"What all are mocking? That's poor sport, methinks."
23361,PART I.,To talk to thee in human language (for
23362,PART I.,"Thou canst not yet speak mine), the forester"

23369,PART I.,
23370,PART I.,_Arn._                           Then waste not                    130
23371,PART I.,Thy time on me: I seek thee not.
23372,PART I.,
23373,PART I.,_Stran._                         Your thoughts
23374,PART I.,Are not far from me. Do not send me back:

23377,PART I.,
23378,PART I.,_Arn._        What wilt thou do for me?
23379,PART I.,

23383,PART I.,
23384,PART I.,"_Arn._ Oh! then you are indeed the Demon, for"
23385,PART I.,Nought else would wittingly wear mine.
23386,PART I.,
23387,PART I.,_Stran._                               I'll show thee

23389,PART I.,Thy choice.
23390,PART I.,
23391,PART I.,_Arn._       On what condition?
23392,PART I.,
23393,PART I.,_Stran._                       There's a question!                 140
23394,PART I.,An hour ago you would have given your soul
23395,PART I.,"To look like other men, and now you pause"
23396,PART I.,To wear the form of heroes.
23397,PART I.,
23398,PART I.,_Arn._                     No; I will not.
23399,PART I.,I must not compromise my soul.
23400,PART I.,
23401,PART I.,"_Stran._                       What soul,"
23402,PART I.,"Worth naming so, would dwell in such a carcase?"
23403,PART I.,
23404,PART I.,"_Arn._ 'Tis an aspiring one, whate'er the tenement"

23408,PART I.,_Stran._                   Not in your own.
23409,PART I.,
23410,PART I.,_Arn._ Whose blood then?
23411,PART I.,
23412,PART I.,_Stran._                 We will talk of that hereafter.

23415,PART I.,"But your own will, no contract save your deeds."
23416,PART I.,Are you content?
23417,PART I.,
23418,PART I.,_Arn._           I take thee at thy word.
23419,PART I.,

23429,PART I.,
23430,PART I.,_Arn._ (_holding out his wounded arm_). Take it all.
23431,PART I.,
23432,PART I.,_Stran._ Not now. A few drops will suffice for this.

23481,PART I.,"You see his aspect--choose it, or reject."
23482,PART I.,I can but promise you his form; his fame
23483,PART I.,Must be long sought and fought for.
23484,PART I.,
23485,PART I.,"_Arn._                              I will fight, too,"
23486,PART I.,But not as a mock Cæsar. Let him pass:
23487,PART I.,"His aspect may be fair, but suits me not."
23488,PART I.,
23489,PART I.,_Stran._ Then you are far more difficult to please
23490,PART I.,"Than Cato's sister, or than Brutus's mother,                       200"

23498,PART I.,And left no footstep?
23499,PART I.,
23500,PART I.,_Stran._             There you err. His substance

23607,PART I.,
23608,PART I.,_Stran._                         I must commend

23631,PART I.,_Stran._       You have done well. The greatest

23645,PART I.,_Stran._ No; that were a pity. But a word or two:
23646,PART I.,His stature is twelve cubits; would you so far
23647,PART I.,"Outstep these times, and be a Titan? Or"
23648,PART I.,(To talk canonically) wax a son

23686,PART I.,
23687,PART I.,_Stran._ Well spoken! And thou doubtless wilt remain
23688,PART I.,Formed as thou art. I may dismiss the mould
23689,PART I.,"Of shadow, which must turn to flesh, to incase"

23937,PART I.,But bear with me: indeed you'll find me useful
23938,PART I.,"Upon your pilgrimage. But come, pronounce"
23939,PART I.,Where shall we now be errant?
23940,PART I.,
23941,PART I.,_Arn._                       Where the World
23942,PART I.,"Is thickest, that I may behold it in"
23943,PART I.,Its workings.
23944,PART I.,
23945,PART I.,"_Stran._     That's to say, where there is War"
23946,PART I.,And Woman in activity. Let's see!
23947,PART I.,Spain--Italy--the new Atlantic world[225]--
23948,PART I.,"Afric with all its Moors. In very truth,"
23949,PART I.,There is small choice: the whole race are just now                 500
23950,PART I.,Tugging as usual at each other's hearts.
23951,PART I.,
23952,PART I.,_Arn._ I have heard great things of Rome.
23953,PART I.,
23954,PART I.,_Stran._                                  A goodly choice--
23955,PART I.,"And scarce a better to be found on earth,"
23956,PART I.,Since Sodom was put out. The field is wide too;
23957,PART I.,"For now the Frank, and Hun, and Spanish scion"
23958,PART I.,"Of the old Vandals, are at play along"
23959,PART I.,The sunny shores of the World's garden.
23960,PART I.,
23961,PART I.,_Arn._                                 How
23962,PART I.,Shall we proceed?
23963,PART I.,
23964,PART I.,"_Stran._         Like gallants, on good coursers."
23965,PART I.,"What, ho! my chargers! Never yet were better,"
23966,PART I.,Since Phaeton was upset into the Po[226].                          510
23967,PART I.,Our pages too!
23968,PART I.,
23969,PART I.,"_Enter two Pages, with four coal-black horses_."
23970,PART I.,
23971,PART I.,_Arn._          A noble sight!
23972,PART I.,
23973,PART I.,_Stran._                      And of
23974,PART I.,"A nobler breed. Match me in Barbary,"
23975,PART I.,"Or your Kochlini race of Araby[de][227],"
23976,PART I.,With these!
23977,PART I.,
23978,PART I.,"_Arn._     The mighty steam, which volumes high"
23979,PART I.,"From their proud nostrils, burns the very air;"
23980,PART I.,"And sparks of flame, like dancing fire-flies wheel"
23981,PART I.,"Around their manes, as common insects swarm"
23982,PART I.,Round common steeds towards sunset.
23983,PART I.,
23984,PART I.,"_Stran._                           Mount, my lord:"
23985,PART I.,They and I are your servitors.
23986,PART I.,
23987,PART I.,_Arn._                        And these
23988,PART I.,Our dark-eyed pages--what may be their names?                      520
23989,PART I.,
23990,PART I.,_Stran._ You shall baptize them.
23991,PART I.,
23992,PART I.,_Arn._                           What! in holy water?
23993,PART I.,
23994,PART I.,"_Stran._ Why not? The deeper sinner, better saint."
23995,PART I.,
23996,PART I.,"_Arn._ They are beautiful, and cannot, sure, be demons."
23997,PART I.,
23998,PART I.,_Stran._ True; the devil's always ugly: and your beauty
23999,PART I.,Is never diabolical.
24000,PART I.,
24001,PART I.,_Arn._               I'll call him
24002,PART I.,"Who bears the golden horn, and wears such bright"
24003,PART I.,"And blooming aspect, _Huon_;[228] for he looks"
24004,PART I.,"Like to the lovely boy lost in the forest,"
24005,PART I.,And never found till now. And for the other
24006,PART I.,"And darker, and more thoughtful, who smiles not,                   530"
24007,PART I.,"But looks as serious though serene as night,"
24008,PART I.,"He shall be _Memnon_[229], from the Ethiop king"
24009,PART I.,Whose statue turns a harper once a day.
24010,PART I.,And you?
24011,PART I.,
24012,PART I.,"_Stran._ I have ten thousand names, and twice"
24013,PART I.,As many attributes; but as I wear
24014,PART I.,"A human shape, will take a human name."
24015,PART I.,
24016,PART I.,_Arn._ More human than the shape (though it was mine once)
24017,PART I.,I trust.
24018,PART I.,
24019,PART I.,_Stran._ Then call me Cæsar.
24020,PART I.,
24021,PART I.,"_Arn._                       Why, that name"
24022,PART I.,"Belongs to Empire, and has been but borne"
24023,PART I.,By the World's lords.
24024,PART I.,
24025,PART I.,_Stran._             And therefore fittest for                     540
24026,PART I.,"The Devil in disguise--since so you deem me,"
24027,PART I.,Unless you call me Pope instead.
24028,PART I.,
24029,PART I.,"_Arn._                           Well, then,"
24030,PART I.,"Cæsar thou shalt be. For myself, my name"
24031,PART I.,Shall be plain Arnold still.
24032,PART I.,
24033,PART I.,_Cæs._                      We'll add a title[df]--
24034,PART I.,"""Count Arnold:"" it hath no ungracious sound,"
24035,PART I.,And will look well upon a billet-doux.
24036,PART I.,
24037,PART I.,_Arn._ Or in an order for a battle-field.
24038,PART I.,
24039,PART I.,_Cæs._ (_sings_).
24040,PART I.,To horse! to horse! my coal-black steed
24041,PART I.,Paws the ground and snuffs the air!
24042,PART I.,There's not a foal of Arab's breed                             550
24043,PART I.,More knows whom he must bear;
24044,PART I.,"On the hill he will not tire,"
24045,PART I.,Swifter as it waxes higher;
24046,PART I.,"In the marsh he will not slacken,"
24047,PART I.,On the plain be overtaken;
24048,PART I.,"In the wave he will not sink,"
24049,PART I.,Nor pause at the brook's side to drink;
24050,PART I.,"In the race he will not pant,"
24051,PART I.,In the combat he'll not faint;
24052,PART I.,"On the stones he will not stumble,                           560"
24053,PART I.,Time nor toil shall make him humble;
24054,PART I.,"In the stall he will not stiffen,"
24055,PART I.,"But be wingèd as a Griffin,"
24056,PART I.,Only flying with his feet:
24057,PART I.,And will not such a voyage be sweet?
24058,PART I.,"Merrily! merrily! never unsound,"
24059,PART I.,Shall our bonny black horses skim over the ground!
24060,PART I.,"From the Alps to the Caucasus, ride we, or fly!"
24061,PART I.,For we'll leave them behind in the glance of an eye.
24062,PART I.,"[_They mount their horses, and disappear_."
24063,PART I.,
24064,PART I.,
24065,PART I.,SCENE II.--_A Camp before the walls of Rome_.
24066,PART I.,
24067,PART I.,ARNOLD _and_ CÆSAR.
24068,PART I.,
24069,PART I.,_Cæs._ You are well entered now.
24070,PART I.,
24071,PART I.,_Arn._                           Aye; but my path
24072,PART I.,Has been o'er carcasses: mine eyes are full[dg]
24073,PART I.,Of blood.
24074,PART I.,
24075,PART I.,"_Cæs._    Then wipe them, and see clearly. Why!"
24076,PART I.,Thou art a conqueror; the chosen knight
24077,PART I.,"And free companion of the gallant Bourbon,"
24078,PART I.,Late constable of France[230]; and now to be
24079,PART I.,Lord of the city which hath been Earth's Lord
24080,PART I.,"Under its emperors, and--changing sex,"
24081,PART I.,"Not sceptre, an Hermaphrodite of Empire--"
24082,PART I.,_Lady_ of the old world[231].
24083,PART I.,
24084,PART I.,_Arn._                       How _old?_ What! are there             10
24085,PART I.,_New_ worlds?
24086,PART I.,
24087,PART I.,"_Cæs._       To _you_. You'll find there are such shortly,"
24088,PART I.,"By its rich harvests, new disease, and gold;"
24089,PART I.,"From one _half_ of the world named a _whole_ new one,"
24090,PART I.,Because you know no better than the dull
24091,PART I.,And dubious notice of your eyes and ears.
24092,PART I.,
24093,PART I.,_Arn._ I'll trust them.
24094,PART I.,
24095,PART I.,"_Cæs._                  Do! They will deceive you sweetly,"
24096,PART I.,And that is better than the bitter truth.
24097,PART I.,
24098,PART I.,_Arn._ Dog!
24099,PART I.,
24100,PART I.,_Cæs._       Man!
24101,PART I.,
24102,PART I.,_Arn._            Devil!
24103,PART I.,
24104,PART I.,_Cæs._                  Your obedient humble servant.
24105,PART I.,
24106,PART I.,"_Arn._ Say _master_ rather. Thou hast lured me on,"
24107,PART I.,"Through scenes of blood and lust, till I am here.                   20"
24108,PART I.,
24109,PART I.,_Cæs._ And where wouldst thou be?
24110,PART I.,
24111,PART I.,"_Arn._                           Oh, _at_ peace--_in_ peace!"
24112,PART I.,
24113,PART I.,_Cæs._ And where is that which is so? From the star
24114,PART I.,"To the winding worm, all life is motion; and"
24115,PART I.,In life _commotion_ is the extremest point
24116,PART I.,Of life. The planet wheels till it becomes
24117,PART I.,"A comet, and destroying as it sweeps"
24118,PART I.,"The stars, goes out. The poor worm winds its way,"
24119,PART I.,"Living upon the death of other things,"
24120,PART I.,"But still, like them, must live and die, the subject"
24121,PART I.,Of something which has made it live and die.                        30
24122,PART I.,"You must obey what all obey, the rule"
24123,PART I.,Of fixed Necessity: against her edict
24124,PART I.,Rebellion prospers not.
24125,PART I.,
24126,PART I.,_Arn._                  And when it prospers----
24127,PART I.,
24128,PART I.,_Cæs._ 'Tis no rebellion.
24129,PART I.,
24130,PART I.,_Arn._                     Will it prosper now?
24131,PART I.,
24132,PART I.,"_Cæs._ The Bourbon hath given orders for the assault,"
24133,PART I.,And by the dawn there will be work.
24134,PART I.,
24135,PART I.,_Arn._                              Alas!
24136,PART I.,And shall the city yield? I see the giant
24137,PART I.,"Abode of the true God, and his true saint,"
24138,PART I.,"Saint Peter, rear its dome and cross into"
24139,PART I.,"That sky whence Christ ascended from the cross,                     40"
24140,PART I.,Which his blood made a badge of glory and
24141,PART I.,"Of joy (as once of torture unto him),--"
24142,PART I.,"God and God's Son, man's sole and only refuge!"
24143,PART I.,
24144,PART I.,"_Cæs._ 'Tis there, and shall be."
24145,PART I.,
24146,PART I.,_Arn._                            What?
24147,PART I.,
24148,PART I.,_Cæs._                                The Crucifix
24149,PART I.,"Above, and many altar shrines below."
24150,PART I.,"Also some culverins upon the walls,"
24151,PART I.,"And harquebusses, and what not; besides"
24152,PART I.,The men who are to kindle them to death
24153,PART I.,Of other men.
24154,PART I.,
24155,PART I.,"_Arn._        And those scarce mortal arches,[232]"
24156,PART I.,"Pile above pile of everlasting wall,                                50"
24157,PART I.,The theatre where Emperors and their subjects
24158,PART I.,(Those subjects _Romans_) stood at gaze upon
24159,PART I.,The battles of the monarchs of the wild
24160,PART I.,And wood--the lion and his tusky rebels
24161,PART I.,"Of the then untamed desert, brought to joust"
24162,PART I.,"In the arena--as right well they might,"
24163,PART I.,When they had left no human foe unconquered--
24164,PART I.,Made even the forest pay its tribute of
24165,PART I.,"Life to their amphitheatre, as well"
24166,PART I.,As Dacia men to die the eternal death                               60
24167,PART I.,"For a sole instant's pastime, and ""Pass on"
24168,PART I.,"To a new gladiator!""--Must it fall?"
24169,PART I.,
24170,PART I.,"_Cæs._ The city, or the amphitheatre?"
24171,PART I.,"The church, or one, or all? for you confound"
24172,PART I.,Both them and me.
24173,PART I.,
24174,PART I.,_Arn._            To-morrow sounds the assault
24175,PART I.,With the first cock-crow.
24176,PART I.,
24177,PART I.,"_Cæs._                   Which, if it end with"
24178,PART I.,"The evening's first nightingale, will be"
24179,PART I.,Something new in the annals of great sieges;
24180,PART I.,For men must have their prey after long toil.
24181,PART I.,
24182,PART I.,"_Arn._ The sun goes down as calmly, and perhaps                     70"
24183,PART I.,"More beautifully, than he did on Rome"
24184,PART I.,On the day Remus leapt her wall.
24185,PART I.,
24186,PART I.,_Cæs._                          I saw him.
24187,PART I.,
24188,PART I.,_Arn._ You!
24189,PART I.,
24190,PART I.,"_Cæs._      Yes, Sir! You forget I am or was"
24191,PART I.,"Spirit, till I took up with your cast shape,"
24192,PART I.,And a worse name. I'm Cæsar and a hunch-back
24193,PART I.,"Now. Well! the first of Cæsars was a bald-head,"
24194,PART I.,And loved his laurels better as a wig
24195,PART I.,(So history says) than as a glory.[233] Thus
24196,PART I.,"The world runs on, but we'll be merry still."
24197,PART I.,I saw your Romulus (simple as I am)                                 80
24198,PART I.,"Slay his own twin, quick-born of the same womb,"
24199,PART I.,"Because he leapt a ditch ('twas then no wall,"
24200,PART I.,Whate'er it now be); and Rome's earliest cement
24201,PART I.,Was brother's blood; and if its native blood
24202,PART I.,Be spilt till the choked Tiber be as red
24203,PART I.,"As e'er 'twas yellow, it will never wear"
24204,PART I.,"The deep hue of the Ocean and the Earth,"
24205,PART I.,Which the great robber sons of fratricide
24206,PART I.,"Have made their never-ceasing scene of slaughter,"
24207,PART I.,For ages.
24208,PART I.,
24209,PART I.,"_Arn._    But what have these done, their far                       90"
24210,PART I.,"Remote descendants, who have lived in peace,"
24211,PART I.,"The peace of Heaven, and in her sunshine of"
24212,PART I.,Piety?
24213,PART I.,
24214,PART I.,"_Cæs._ And what had _they_ done, whom the old"
24215,PART I.,Romans o'erswept?--Hark!
24216,PART I.,
24217,PART I.,_Arn._                   They are soldiers singing
24218,PART I.,"A reckless roundelay, upon the eve"
24219,PART I.,"Of many deaths, it may be of their own."
24220,PART I.,
24221,PART I.,_Cæs._ And why should they not sing as well as swans?
24222,PART I.,"They are black ones, to be sure."
24223,PART I.,
24224,PART I.,"_Arn._                          So, you are learned,"
24225,PART I.,"I see, too?"
24226,PART I.,
24227,PART I.,"_Cæs._     In my grammar, certes. I"
24228,PART I.,"Was educated for a monk of all times,                              100"
24229,PART I.,And once I was well versed in the forgotten
24230,PART I.,"Etruscan letters, and--were I so minded--"
24231,PART I.,Could make their hieroglyphics plainer than
24232,PART I.,Your alphabet.
24233,PART I.,
24234,PART I.,_Arn._         And wherefore do you not?
24235,PART I.,
24236,PART I.,_Cæs._ It answers better to resolve the alphabet
24237,PART I.,"Back into hieroglyphics. Like your statesman,"
24238,PART I.,"And prophet, pontiff, doctor, alchymist,"
24239,PART I.,"Philosopher, and what not, they have built"
24240,PART I.,"More Babels, without new dispersion, than"

24242,PART I.,"Who failed and fled each other. Why? why, marry,"

24244,PART I.,"They are wiser now, and will not separate"
24245,PART I.,"For nonsense. Nay, it is their brotherhood,"
24246,PART I.,Their Shibboleth--their Koran--Talmud--their

24248,PART I.,They build more----
24249,PART I.,
24250,PART I.,"_Arn._ (_interrupting him_). Oh, thou everlasting sneerer!"
24251,PART I.,Be silent! How the soldier's rough strain seems
24252,PART I.,Softened by distance to a hymn-like cadence!
24253,PART I.,Listen!
24254,PART I.,
24255,PART I.,_Cæs._ Yes. I have heard the angels sing.                          120
24256,PART I.,
24257,PART I.,_Arn._ And demons howl.
24258,PART I.,
24259,PART I.,"_Cæs._                 And man, too. Let us listen:"
24260,PART I.,I love all music.
24261,PART I.,
24262,PART I.,_Song of the Soldiers within_.
24263,PART I.,
24264,PART I.,The black bands came over

24266,PART I.,"With Bourbon, the rover,"
24267,PART I.,They passed the broad Po.
24268,PART I.,"We have beaten all foemen,"
24269,PART I.,"We have captured a King[234],"
24270,PART I.,"We have turned back on no men,"

24272,PART I.,Here's the Bourbon for ever!
24273,PART I.,"Though penniless all,"
24274,PART I.,We'll have one more endeavour
24275,PART I.,At yonder old wall.
24276,PART I.,With the Bourbon we'll gather
24277,PART I.,At day-dawn before
24278,PART I.,"The gates, and together"
24279,PART I.,Or break or climb o'er
24280,PART I.,"The wall: on the ladder,"
24281,PART I.,"As mounts each firm foot[dh],                        140"
24282,PART I.,"Our shout shall grow gladder,"
24283,PART I.,And Death only be mute[235].
24284,PART I.,With the Bourbon we'll mount o'er
24285,PART I.,"The walls of old Rome,"
24286,PART I.,And who then shall count o'er[di]
24287,PART I.,The spoils of each dome?
24288,PART I.,Up! up with the Lily!
24289,PART I.,And down with the Keys!
24290,PART I.,"In old Rome, the seven-hilly,"
24291,PART I.,We'll revel at ease.                                 150
24292,PART I.,"Her streets shall be gory,"
24293,PART I.,"Her Tiber all red,"
24294,PART I.,And her temples so hoary
24295,PART I.,Shall clang with our tread.
24296,PART I.,"Oh, the Bourbon! the Bourbon[236]!"
24297,PART I.,The Bourbon for aye!
24298,PART I.,Of our song bear the burden!
24299,PART I.,"And fire, fire away!"
24300,PART I.,"With Spain for the vanguard,"
24301,PART I.,Our varied host comes;                               160
24302,PART I.,And next to the Spaniard
24303,PART I.,Beat Germany's drums;
24304,PART I.,And Italy's lances
24305,PART I.,Are couched at their mother;
24306,PART I.,"But our leader from France is,"
24307,PART I.,Who warred with his brother.
24308,PART I.,"Oh, the Bourbon! the Bourbon!"
24309,PART I.,"Sans country or home,"
24310,PART I.,"We'll follow the Bourbon,"
24311,PART I.,To plunder old Rome.                                 170
24312,PART I.,
24313,PART I.,_Cæs._           An indifferent song

24315,PART I.,
24316,PART I.,"_Arn._ Yes, if they keep to their chorus. But here comes"
24317,PART I.,The general with his chiefs and men of trust[dj].
24318,PART I.,A goodly rebel.
24319,PART I.,
24320,PART I.,"_Enter the Constable_ BOURBON _""cum suis,"" etc., etc._"
24321,PART I.,
24322,PART I.,"_Phil._          How now, noble Prince,"
24323,PART I.,You are not cheerful?
24324,PART I.,
24325,PART I.,_Bourb._             Why should I be so?
24326,PART I.,
24327,PART I.,"_Phil._ Upon the eve of conquest, such as ours,"
24328,PART I.,Most men would be so.
24329,PART I.,
24330,PART I.,_Bourb._               If I were secure!
24331,PART I.,
24332,PART I.,"_Phil._ Doubt not our soldiers. Were the walls of adamant,"
24333,PART I.,They'd crack them. Hunger is a sharp artillery.                    180
24334,PART I.,
24335,PART I.,_Bourb._ That they will falter is my least of fears.
24336,PART I.,"That they will be repulsed, with Bourbon for"
24337,PART I.,"Their chief, and all their kindled appetites"
24338,PART I.,To marshal them on--were those hoary walls
24339,PART I.,"Mountains, and those who guard them like the gods"
24340,PART I.,"Of the old fables, I would trust my Titans;--"
24341,PART I.,But now----
24342,PART I.,
24343,PART I.,_Phil._    They are but men who war with mortals.
24344,PART I.,
24345,PART I.,"_Bourb._ True: but those walls have girded in great ages,"
24346,PART I.,And sent forth mighty spirits. The past earth
24347,PART I.,And present phantom of imperious Rome[dk]                          190
24348,PART I.,Is peopled with those warriors; and methinks
24349,PART I.,"They flit along the eternal City's rampart,"
24350,PART I.,"And stretch their glorious, gory, shadowy hands,"
24351,PART I.,And beckon me away!
24352,PART I.,
24353,PART I.,_Phil._            So let them! Wilt thou
24354,PART I.,Turn back from shadowy menaces of shadows?
24355,PART I.,
24356,PART I.,"_Bourb._ They do not menace me. I could have faced,"
24357,PART I.,"Methinks, a Sylla's menace; but they clasp,"
24358,PART I.,"And raise, and wring their dim and deathlike hands,"
24359,PART I.,And with their thin aspen faces and fixed eyes
24360,PART I.,Fascinate mine. Look there!
24361,PART I.,
24362,PART I.,_Phil._                    I look upon                             200
24363,PART I.,A lofty battlement.
24364,PART I.,
24365,PART I.,_Bourb._            And there!
24366,PART I.,
24367,PART I.,_Phil._                       Not even
24368,PART I.,"A guard in sight; they wisely keep below,"
24369,PART I.,Sheltered by the grey parapet from some
24370,PART I.,"Stray bullet of our lansquenets, who might"
24371,PART I.,Practise in the cool twilight.
24372,PART I.,
24373,PART I.,_Bourb._                      You are blind.
24374,PART I.,
24375,PART I.,_Phil._ If seeing nothing more than may be seen
24376,PART I.,Be so.
24377,PART I.,
24378,PART I.,_Bourb._ A thousand years have manned the walls
24379,PART I.,"With all their heroes,--the last Cato[237] stands"
24380,PART I.,"And tears his bowels, rather than survive"
24381,PART I.,The liberty of that I would enslave.                               210
24382,PART I.,And the first Cassar with his triumphs flits
24383,PART I.,From battlement to battlement.
24384,PART I.,
24385,PART I.,_Phil._                        Then conquer
24386,PART I.,The walls for which he conquered and be greater!
24387,PART I.,
24388,PART I.,"_Bourb._ True: so I will, or perish."
24389,PART I.,
24390,PART I.,_Phil._                              You can _not_.
24391,PART I.,In such an enterprise to die is rather
24392,PART I.,"The dawn of an eternal day, than death."
24393,PART I.,[_Count_ ARNOLD _and_ CÆSAR _advance_.
24394,PART I.,
24395,PART I.,"_Cæs._ And the mere men--do they, too, sweat beneath"
24396,PART I.,The noon of this same ever-scorching glory?
24397,PART I.,
24398,PART I.,_Bourb._                                   Ah!
24399,PART I.,"Welcome the bitter Hunchback! and his master,"
24400,PART I.,"The beauty of our host, and brave as beauteous,                    220"
24401,PART I.,And generous as lovely. We shall find
24402,PART I.,Work for you both ere morning.
24403,PART I.,
24404,PART I.,"_Cæs._                        You will find,"
24405,PART I.,"So please your Highness, no less for yourself."
24406,PART I.,
24407,PART I.,"_Bourb._ And if I do, there will not be a labourer"
24408,PART I.,"More forward, Hunchback!"
24409,PART I.,
24410,PART I.,"_Cæs._                  You may well say so,"
24411,PART I.,"For _you_ have seen that back--as general,"
24412,PART I.,Placed in the rear in action--but your foes
24413,PART I.,Have never seen it.
24414,PART I.,
24415,PART I.,"_Bourb._           That's a fair retort,"
24416,PART I.,For I provoked it:--but the Bourbon's breast
24417,PART I.,"Has been, and ever shall be, far advanced                          230"
24418,PART I.,"In danger's face as yours, were you the _devil_."
24419,PART I.,
24420,PART I.,"_Cæs._ And if I were, I might have saved myself"
24421,PART I.,The toil of coming here.
24422,PART I.,
24423,PART I.,_Phil._                 Why so?
24424,PART I.,
24425,PART I.,_Cæs._                         One half
24426,PART I.,Of your brave bands of their own bold accord
24427,PART I.,"Will go to him, the other half be sent,"
24428,PART I.,"More swiftly, not less surely."
24429,PART I.,
24430,PART I.,"_Bourb._                      Arnold, your"
24431,PART I.,Slight crooked _friend's_ as snake-like in his words
24432,PART I.,As his deeds.
24433,PART I.,
24434,PART I.,_Cæs._        Your Highness much mistakes me.
24435,PART I.,The first snake was a flatterer--I am none;
24436,PART I.,"And for my deeds, I only sting when stung.                         240"
24437,PART I.,
24438,PART I.,"_Bourb._ You are brave, and _that's_ enough for me; and quick"
24439,PART I.,In speech as sharp in action--and that's more.
24440,PART I.,"I am not alone the soldier, but the soldiers'"
24441,PART I.,Comrade.
24442,PART I.,
24443,PART I.,"_Cæs._   They are but bad company, your Highness;"
24444,PART I.,"And worse even for their friends than foes, as being"
24445,PART I.,More permanent acquaintance.
24446,PART I.,
24447,PART I.,"_Phil._                      How now, fellow!"
24448,PART I.,"Thou waxest insolent, beyond the privilege"
24449,PART I.,Of a buffoon.
24450,PART I.,
24451,PART I.,_Cæs._       You mean I speak the truth.
24452,PART I.,I'll lie--it is as easy: then you'll praise me
24453,PART I.,For calling you a hero.
24454,PART I.,
24455,PART I.,_Bourb._               Philibert!                                  250
24456,PART I.,"Let him alone; he's brave, and ever has"
24457,PART I.,"Been first, with that swart face and mountain shoulder,"
24458,PART I.,"In field or storm, and patient in starvation;"
24459,PART I.,"And for his tongue, the camp is full of licence,"
24460,PART I.,And the sharp stinging of a lively rogue
24461,PART I.,"Is, to my mind, far preferable to"
24462,PART I.,"The gross, dull, heavy, gloomy execration"
24463,PART I.,"Of a mere famished sullen grumbling slave,[dl]"
24464,PART I.,"Whom nothing can convince save a full meal,"

24470,PART I.,
24471,PART I.,_Bourb._                             Be silent!
24472,PART I.,
24473,PART I.,"_Cæs._ Aye, but not idle. Work yourself with words![dm]"
24474,PART I.,You have few to speak.
24475,PART I.,
24476,PART I.,_Phil._                What means the audacious prater?
24477,PART I.,
24478,PART I.,"_Cæs._ To prate, like other prophets."
24479,PART I.,
24480,PART I.,_Bourb._                              Philibert!
24481,PART I.,Why will you vex him? Have we not enough
24482,PART I.,To think on? Arnold! I will lead the attack
24483,PART I.,To-morrow.
24484,PART I.,
24485,PART I.,"_Arn._     I have heard as much, my Lord."
24486,PART I.,

24488,PART I.,
24489,PART I.,_Arn._                        Since I must not lead.
24490,PART I.,
24491,PART I.,_Bourb._ 'Tis necessary for the further daring

24494,PART I.,First step.
24495,PART I.,

24505,PART I.,"Still the world's masters! Civilised, barbarian,"

24509,PART I.,"That we will fight as well, and rule much better."
24510,PART I.,
24511,PART I.,"_Cæs._ No doubt, the camp's the school of civic rights."
24512,PART I.,What would you make of Rome?
24513,PART I.,
24514,PART I.,_Bourb._                    That which it was.
24515,PART I.,

24517,PART I.,
24518,PART I.,"_Bourb._                 No, slave! in the first Cæsar's,"

24520,PART I.,
24521,PART I.,_Cæs._                             And kings!
24522,PART I.,'Tis a great name for blood-hounds.
24523,PART I.,
24524,PART I.,_Bourb._                           There's a demon

24527,PART I.,
24528,PART I.,"_Cæs._      On the eve of battle, no;--"
24529,PART I.,That were not soldier-like. 'Tis for the general

26253,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"parade of power and magnificence, and had dispersed with little or"
26254,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"nothing accomplished. It was ""impar Achilli"" (_vide ante_, p. 535,"
26255,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"note 1), an empty menace, ill-matched with the revolutionary spirit,"

26259,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,The immediate and efficient cause of the Congress of Verona was the

26267,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"government was established under the name of the ""Supreme Regency of"

26288,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"not, as she was pleased to determine. There was one dissentient, the"
26289,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"Duke of Wellington, who refused to sign the _procès verbaux_. His"
26290,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"Britannic Majesty had been advised to let the Spaniards alone, and not"

26292,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"Congress, the French invasion of Spain, could not be foreseen; and,"
26293,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"apparently, all that the Congress had accomplished was to refuse to"

26312,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,
26313,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,The point of Byron's diatribe is that Squire Dives had enjoyed good

26334,INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.,"With regard to the style and quality of his new satire, Byron was under"

28298,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"that need be said with regard to the ""sources"" of the poem."
28299,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28300,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,Two separate works were consulted: (1) _A Narrative of the Mutiny on

28305,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"and Arranged from the Extensive Communications of Mr. William Mariner,"
28306,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"by John Martin, M.D., 1817."
28307,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28308,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"According to George Clinton (_Life and Writings of Lord Byron_, 1824, p."
28309,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"656), Byron was profoundly impressed by Mariner's report of the scenery"
28310,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"and folklore of the _Friendly Islands_, was ""never tired of talking of"
28311,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"it to his friends,"" and, in order to turn this poetic material to"
28312,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"account, finally bethought him that Bligh's _Narrative_ of the mutiny of"
28313,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"the _Bounty_ would serve as a framework or structure ""for an embroidery"
28314,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"of rare device""--the figures and foliage of a tropical pattern. That, at"
28315,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"least, is the substance of Clinton's analysis of the ""sources"" of _The"
28316,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Island_, and whether he spoke, or only feigned to speak, with authority,"
28317,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,his criticism is sound and to the point. The story of the mutiny of the
28318,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"_Bounty_, which is faithfully related in the first canto, is not, as the"
28319,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"second title implies, a prelude to the ""Adventures of Christian and his"
28320,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Comrades,"" but to a description of ""The Island,"" an Ogygia of the South"
28321,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,Seas.
28322,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28323,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,It must be borne in mind that Byron's acquaintance with the details of
28324,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,the mutiny of the _Bounty_ was derived exclusively from Bligh's
28325,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,_Narrative_; that he does not seem to have studied the minutes of the
28326,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"court-martial on Peter Heywood and the other prisoners (September,"
28327,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"1792), or to have possessed the information that in 1809, and, again, in"
28328,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"1815, the Admiralty received authentic information with regard to the"
28329,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,final settlement of Christian and his comrades on Pitcairn Island.
28330,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Articles, however, had appeared in the _Quarterly Review_, February,"
28331,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"1810, vol. iii. pp. 23, 24, and July, 1815, vol. xiii. pp. 376-378,"
28332,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"which contained an extract from the log-book of Captain Mayhew Folger,"
28333,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"of the American ship _Topaz_, dated September 29, 1808, and letters from"
28334,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Folger (March 1, 1813), and Sir Thomas Staines, October 18, 1814, which"
28335,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"solved the mystery. Moreover, the article of February, 1810, is quoted"
28336,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"in the notes (pp. 313-318) affixed to Miss Mitford's _Christina, the"
28337,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Maid of the South Seas_, 1811, a poem founded on Bligh's _Narrative_, of"
28338,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,which neither Byron or his reviewers seem to have heard.
28339,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28340,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,But whatever may have been his opportunities of ascertaining the facts
28341,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"of the case, it is certain (see his note to Canto IV. section vi. line"
28342,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"122) that he did not know what became of Christian, and that whereas in"
28343,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"the first canto he follows the text of Bligh's _Narrative_, in the three"
28344,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"last cantos he draws upon his imagination, turning Tahiti into Toobonai"
28345,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"(Tubuai), and transporting Toobonai from one archipelago to"
28346,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,another--from the Society to the Friendly Islands.
28347,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28348,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,Another and still more surprising feature of _The Island_ is that Byron
28349,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"accepts, without qualification or reserve, the guilt of the mutineers"
28350,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,and the innocence and worth of Lieutenant Bligh. It is true that by
28351,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"inheritance he was imbued with the traditions of the service, and from"
28352,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,personal experience understood the necessity of discipline on board
28353,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,ship; but it may be taken for granted that if he had known that the
28354,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"sympathy, if not the esteem, of the public had been transferred from"
28355,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Bligh to Christian, that in the opinion of grave and competent writers,"
28356,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,the guilt of mutiny on the high seas had been almost condoned by the
28357,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"violence and brutality of the commanding officer, he would have sided"
28358,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"with the oppressed rather than the oppressor. As it is, he takes Bligh"
28359,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"at his own valuation, and carefully abstains from ""eulogizing mutiny."""
28360,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"(Letter to L. Hunt, January 25, 1823.)"
28361,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28362,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"The story of the ""mutiny of the _Bounty_"" happened in this wise. In 1787"
28363,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"it occurred to certain West India planters and merchants, resident in"
28364,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"London, that it would benefit the natives, and perhaps themselves, if"
28365,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"the bread-fruit tree, which flourished in Tahiti (the Otaheite of"
28366,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks, see _Poetical Works_, 1899, ii. 7,"
28367,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"note 2) and other islands of the South Seas, could be acclimatized in"
28368,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"the West Indies. A petition was addressed to the king, with the result"
28369,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"that a vessel, with a burden of 215 tons, which Banks christened the"
28370,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"_Bounty_, sailed from Spithead December 23, 1787. Lieutenant William"
28371,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Bligh, who had sailed with Cook in the _Resolution_, acted as commanding"
28372,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"officer, and under him were five midshipmen, a master, two master's"
28373,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"mates, etc.--forty-four persons all told. The _Bounty_ arrived at Tahiti"
28374,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"October 26, 1788, and there for six delightful months the ship's company"

28421,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"confined in ""Pandora's box,"" perished in the wreck, and the remaining"
28422,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"ten were brought back to England, and tried by court-martial. (See _The"
28423,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Eventful History of the Mutiny, etc._ (by Sir John Barrow), 1831, pp."
28424,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,205-244.)
28425,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28426,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"The story, which runs through the second, third, and fourth cantos, may"
28427,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,possibly owe some of its details to a vague recollection of incidents
28428,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"which happened, or were supposed to happen, at Tahiti, in the interval"
28429,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"between the final departure of the _Bounty_, September 21, 1789, and the"
28430,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"arrival of the _Pandora_, March 23, 1791; but, as a whole, it is a work"
28431,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,of fiction.
28432,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28433,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"With the exception of the fifteenth and sixteenth cantos of _Don Juan_,"
28434,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,_The Island_ was the last poem of any importance which Byron lived to
28435,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"write, and the question naturally suggests itself--Is the new song as"
28436,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,good as the old? Byron answers the question himself. He tells Leigh Hunt
28437,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"(January 25, 1823) that he hopes the ""poem will be a little above the"
28438,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"ordinary run of periodical poesy,"" and that, though portions of the"
28439,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"Toobonai (_sic_) islanders are ""pamby,"" he intends ""to scatter some"
28440,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"_un_common places here and there nevertheless."" On the whole, in point"
28441,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"of conception and execution, _The Island_ is weaker and less coherent"
28442,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,than the _Corsair_; but it contains lines and passages (_e.g._ Canto I.
28443,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"lines 107-124, 133-140; Canto II. lines 272-297; Canto IV. lines 94-188)"
28444,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"which display a finer feeling and a more ""exalted wit"" than the ""purple"
28445,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"patches"" of _The Turkish Tales_."
28446,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,
28447,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,"The poetic faculty is somewhat exhausted, but the poetic vision has been"
28448,INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_,purged and heightened by suffering and self-knowledge.

29498,IV.,Not mortally:--his worst wound was within;
29499,IV.,"His brow was pale, his blue eyes sunken in,                        100"
29500,IV.,"And blood-drops, sprinkled o'er his yellow hair,"
29501,IV.,"Showed that his faintness came not from despair,"
29502,IV.,"But Nature's ebb. Beside him was another,"
29503,IV.,"Rough as a bear, but willing as a brother,--"
29504,IV.,"Ben Bunting, who essayed to wash, and wipe,"
29505,IV.,"And bind his wound--then calmly lit his pipe,"
29506,IV.,"A trophy which survived a hundred fights,"
29507,IV.,A beacon which had cheered ten thousand nights.
29508,IV.,The fourth and last of this deserted group
29509,IV.,"Walked up and down--at times would stand, then stoop               110"
29510,IV.,To pick a pebble up--then let it drop--
29511,IV.,Then hurry as in haste--then quickly stop--
29512,IV.,Then cast his eyes on his companions--then
29513,IV.,"Half whistle half a tune, and pause again--"
29514,IV.,"And then his former movements would redouble,"
29515,IV.,With something between carelessness and trouble.
29516,IV.,"This is a long description, but applies"
29517,IV.,To scarce five minutes passed before the eyes;
29518,IV.,But yet _what_ minutes! Moments like to these
