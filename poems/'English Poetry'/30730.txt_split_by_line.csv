77,INTRODUCTION,
78,INTRODUCTION,"The Rev. Mark J. McNeal, S. J., who was one of the successors of"
79,INTRODUCTION,Lafcadio Hearn in the chair of English Literature at the Tokyo Imperial
80,INTRODUCTION,"University, in an interesting article recounts the following incident"
81,INTRODUCTION,"of his experience in that institution.  ""I was seated on the examining"
82,INTRODUCTION,"board with Professor Ichikawa, the dean of the English department..."
83,INTRODUCTION,There entered the room a student whom I recognized as among the best in
84,INTRODUCTION,"the class, a sharp young chap with big Mongolian eyes, and one who had"
85,INTRODUCTION,never to my knowledge given any hint of even a leaning toward
86,INTRODUCTION,"Christianity.  I remembered, however, that his thesis submitted for a"
87,INTRODUCTION,degree had been a study of Francis Thompson.  Following the usual
88,INTRODUCTION,"custom, I began to question him about his thesis."
89,INTRODUCTION,
90,INTRODUCTION,"""'Why did you choose Thompson?'"
91,INTRODUCTION,
92,INTRODUCTION,"""'Well, he is quite a famous poet.'"
93,INTRODUCTION,
94,INTRODUCTION,"""'What kind of poet is he?'"
95,INTRODUCTION,
96,INTRODUCTION,"""'We might call him a mystic.'"
97,INTRODUCTION,
98,INTRODUCTION,"""'Is he a mystic of the orthodox sort, like Cynewulf or Crashaw; or an"
99,INTRODUCTION,"unorthodox mystic, like Blake or Shelley?'"
100,INTRODUCTION,
101,INTRODUCTION,"""'Oh, he's orthodox.'"
102,INTRODUCTION,
103,INTRODUCTION,"""'Well, now, what do you consider his greatest production?'"
104,INTRODUCTION,
105,INTRODUCTION,"""'Why, I should say ""The Hound of Heaven."""
106,INTRODUCTION,
107,INTRODUCTION,"""'Well, what on earth does Thompson mean by that Hound?'"
108,INTRODUCTION,
109,INTRODUCTION,"""'He means God.'"
110,INTRODUCTION,
111,INTRODUCTION,"""'But is not that a rather irreverent way for Thompson to be talking"
112,INTRODUCTION,"about God, calling Him a hound?  What does he mean by comparing God to"
113,INTRODUCTION,a hound?'
114,INTRODUCTION,
115,INTRODUCTION,"""'Well, he means the pursuit of God.'"
116,INTRODUCTION,
117,INTRODUCTION,"""'Oh, I see, Thompson is pursuing God, is he?'"
118,INTRODUCTION,
119,INTRODUCTION,"""'Oh, no.  He is rather running away from God.'"
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,"""'Well, then, God is pursuing Thompson, is that it?'"
122,INTRODUCTION,
123,INTRODUCTION,"""'Yes, that's it.'"
124,INTRODUCTION,
125,INTRODUCTION,[Illustration: Titanic glooms of chasm√®d fears  _Page 45_]
126,INTRODUCTION,
127,INTRODUCTION,"'""But, see here; according to Thompson's belief God is everywhere,"
128,INTRODUCTION,isn't He?'
129,INTRODUCTION,
130,INTRODUCTION,"""'Yes.'"
131,INTRODUCTION,
132,INTRODUCTION,"""'Well, then, how can God be going after Thompson?  Is it a physical"
133,INTRODUCTION,pursuit?'
134,INTRODUCTION,
135,INTRODUCTION,"""'No.  It is a moral pursuit.'"
136,INTRODUCTION,
137,INTRODUCTION,"""'A moral pursuit!  What's that?  What is God after?'"
138,INTRODUCTION,
139,INTRODUCTION,"""'He is after Thompson's love.'"
140,INTRODUCTION,
141,INTRODUCTION,"""And then we, the Jesuit and the Buddhist, began to follow the windings"
142,INTRODUCTION,"and turnings of that wondrous poem, the most mystic and spiritual thing"
143,INTRODUCTION,that has been written since St. Teresa laid down her pen.  What the
144,INTRODUCTION,other member of the examining board thought of it all I never heard.
145,INTRODUCTION,But I think I acquired a satisfactory answer to that question so often
146,INTRODUCTION,put to me: Can the Japanese really grasp a spiritual truth?  Do they
147,INTRODUCTION,"really get at the meaning of Christianity?  This, of a race that has"
148,INTRODUCTION,produced more martyrs than any other nation since the fall of Rome and
149,INTRODUCTION,that kept the Faith for two centuries without a visible symbol or
150,INTRODUCTION,"document!"""
151,INTRODUCTION,
152,INTRODUCTION,The incident supplies matter for other conclusions more germane to the
153,INTRODUCTION,"subject of this essay.  The late Bert Leston Taylor, a journalist whose"
154,INTRODUCTION,"journalism had a literary facet of critical brilliance, once declared"
155,INTRODUCTION,that he could not perceive the excellence of Francis Thompson's poetry.
156,INTRODUCTION,When someone suggested that it might be that he was not spiritual
157,INTRODUCTION,"enough, the retort was laconic and crushing, ""Or, perhaps, not"
158,INTRODUCTION,"ecclesiastical enough.""  Like most good retorts Taylor's had more wit"
159,INTRODUCTION,"than truth.  He was obsessed by the notion, prevalent among a certain"
160,INTRODUCTION,"class of literary critics, that Francis Thompson's fame was the"
161,INTRODUCTION,"artificially stimulated applause of a Catholic coterie, whose"
162,INTRODUCTION,enthusiasm could hardly be shared by readers with no particular
163,INTRODUCTION,curiosity about Catholic ideas or modes of religion.  It was probably
164,INTRODUCTION,"this obsession which prompted that able critic, Mr. H. D. Traill, to"
165,INTRODUCTION,"write to Mr. Wilfrid Meynell when the ""Hound of Heaven"" first appeared:"
166,INTRODUCTION,"""I quite agree with you in thinking him a remarkable poet, but, if he"
167,INTRODUCTION,is ever to become other than a 'poet's poet' or 'critic's poet'--if
168,INTRODUCTION,indeed it is worth anyone's ambition to be other than that--it will
169,INTRODUCTION,only be by working in a different manner.  A 'public' to appreciate the
170,INTRODUCTION,"'Hound of Heaven' is to me inconceivable.""  Mr. William Archer, an"
171,INTRODUCTION,"experienced judge of popular likes, was of the same opinion.  ""Yet,"""
172,INTRODUCTION,"Francis Thompson's biographer tells us, ""in the three years after"
173,INTRODUCTION,Thompson's death the separate edition of the 'Hound of Heaven' sold
174,INTRODUCTION,"fifty thousand copies; and, apart from anthologies, many more thousands"
175,INTRODUCTION,"were sold of the books containing it.""  When the ""Hound of Heaven"" is"
176,INTRODUCTION,"selected for study, and explained in words of one syllable, by a young"
177,INTRODUCTION,Japanese student in the Tokyo Imperial University almost thirty years
178,INTRODUCTION,"after the poem was published, one can hardly maintain that it calls for"
179,INTRODUCTION,certain ecclesiastical affiliations before it can be understood and
180,INTRODUCTION,"felt, or that its ""public"" is necessarily circumscribed."
181,INTRODUCTION,
182,INTRODUCTION,It must be owned indeed that Francis Thompson was a puzzle to his
183,INTRODUCTION,contemporaries of the nineties.  He paid the usual penalty of vaulting
184,INTRODUCTION,originality.  The decade is famous for its bold experiments and shining
185,INTRODUCTION,"successes in the art of poetry.  One might expect that a public, grown"
186,INTRODUCTION,accustomed to exquisitely wrought novelties and eager to extend them a
187,INTRODUCTION,"welcome, would have been preordained to recognize and hail the genius"
188,INTRODUCTION,"of Thompson.  But it was not so.  The estheticism of the nineties, for"
189,INTRODUCTION,"all its sweet and fragile flowers, was rooted in the dark passions of"
190,INTRODUCTION,the flesh.  Its language was the language of death and despair and
191,INTRODUCTION,annihilation and the Epicurean need of exhausting the hedonistic
192,INTRODUCTION,possibilities of life ere the final engulfing in darkness and silence.
193,INTRODUCTION,"When the speech of Thompson, laden with religion and spirituality and"
194,INTRODUCTION,"Christian mystery, broke with golden turbulence upon the world of the"
195,INTRODUCTION,"nineties, the critics were abashed and knew not what to think of it."
196,INTRODUCTION,"The effect was somewhat like that produced by Attwater, in Stevenson's"
197,INTRODUCTION,"""The Ebb-Tide,"" when he began suddenly to discourse on Divine Grace to"
198,INTRODUCTION,the amazement of Herrick and his crew of scoundrels from the stolen
199,INTRODUCTION,"_Farallone_.  ""Oh,"" exclaimed the unspeakable Huish, when they had"
200,INTRODUCTION,"recovered breath, ""Oh, look 'ere, turn down the lights at once, and the"
201,INTRODUCTION,"Band of 'Ope will oblige!  This ain't a spiritual s√©ance.""  It had"
202,INTRODUCTION,something akin to the madness of poor Christopher Smart when he fell
203,INTRODUCTION,into the habit of dropping on his knees and praying in the crowded
204,INTRODUCTION,"London streets.  There was incongruity, verging on the indecent, in"
205,INTRODUCTION,"this intrusion of religion into art, as if an archangel were to attend"
206,INTRODUCTION,an afternoon tea in Mayfair or an absinthe session in a Bohemian cafe.
207,INTRODUCTION,"It was, in Dr. Johnson's phrase, ""an unnecessary deviation from the"
208,INTRODUCTION,"usual modes of the world"" which struck the world dumb."
209,INTRODUCTION,
210,INTRODUCTION,The poetry of Francis Thompson appeared in three small volumes:
211,INTRODUCTION,"""Poems,"" published in 1893; ""Sister Songs,"" in 1895; and ""New Poems,"""
212,INTRODUCTION,"in 1897.  The first of these volumes contained the ""Hound of Heaven"";"
213,INTRODUCTION,"though it staggered reviewers at large, they yielded dubious and"
214,INTRODUCTION,carefully measured praise and waited for developments.  The pack was
215,INTRODUCTION,"unleashed and the hue-and-cry raised on the coming of ""Sister Songs"""
216,INTRODUCTION,"and ""New Poems.""  Andrew Lang and Mr. Arthur Symons led the chorus of"
217,INTRODUCTION,"disapproval.  It is amusing to read now that Francis Thompson's ""faults"
218,INTRODUCTION,"are fundamental.  Though he uses the treasure of the Temple, he is not"
219,INTRODUCTION,a religious poet.  The note of a true spiritual passion never once
220,INTRODUCTION,"sounds in his book.""  Another critic of the poet declares that ""nothing"
221,INTRODUCTION,"could be stronger than his language, nothing weaker than the impression"
222,INTRODUCTION,it leaves on the mind.  It is like a dictionary of obsolete English
223,INTRODUCTION,"suffering from a severe fit of delirium tremens.""  A prominent literary"
224,INTRODUCTION,"periodical saw, in the attempt to foist Thompson on the public as a"
225,INTRODUCTION,"genuine poet, a sectarian effort to undermine the literary press of"
226,INTRODUCTION,"England.  In the course of a year the sale of ""Sister Songs"" amounted"
227,INTRODUCTION,"to 349 copies.  The ""New Poems"" fared worse; its sale, never large,"
228,INTRODUCTION,"practically ceased a few years after its appearance, three copies being"
229,INTRODUCTION,sold during the first six months of 1902.
230,INTRODUCTION,
231,INTRODUCTION,[Illustration: Across the margent of the world I fled  _Page 47_]
232,INTRODUCTION,
233,INTRODUCTION,And all this despite strong recommendations from fastidious quarters.
234,INTRODUCTION,George Meredith's recognition was instantaneous and unreserved.
235,INTRODUCTION,Henley's was accompanied by reproofs.  Mr. Richard LeGallienne was
236,INTRODUCTION,"enthusiastic.  Mr. William Archer said to a friend, ""This is not work"
237,INTRODUCTION,which can possibly be _popular_ in the wide sense; but it is work that
238,INTRODUCTION,will be read and treasured centuries hence by those who really care for
239,INTRODUCTION,"poetry.""  And he wrote to Thompson, ""I assure you no conceivable"
240,INTRODUCTION,reaction can wipe out or overlay such work as yours.  It is firm-based
241,INTRODUCTION,on the rock of absolute beauty; and this I say all the more confidently
242,INTRODUCTION,"because it does not happen to appeal to my own speculative, or even my"
243,INTRODUCTION,"own literary, prejudices.""  The most extravagant admirer of all, and"
244,INTRODUCTION,the one who will probably turn out to have come nearer the mark than
245,INTRODUCTION,"any of Francis Thompson's contemporaries, was Mr. J. L. Garvin, the"
246,INTRODUCTION,"well known English leader-writer in politics and literature.  ""After"
247,INTRODUCTION,"the publication of his second volume,"" he wrote in the English"
248,INTRODUCTION,"_Bookman_, March 1897, ""when it became clear that the 'Hound of Heaven'"
249,INTRODUCTION,and 'Sister Songs' should be read together as a strict lyrical
250,INTRODUCTION,"sequence, there was no longer any comparison possible except the"
251,INTRODUCTION,"highest, the inevitable comparison with even Shakespeare's Sonnets."
252,INTRODUCTION,The Sonnets are the greatest soliloquy in literature.  The 'Hound of
253,INTRODUCTION,Heaven' and 'Sister Songs' are the second greatest; and there is no
254,INTRODUCTION,third.  In each case it is rather consciousness imaged in the magic
255,INTRODUCTION,mirror of poetry than explicit autobiography....  Even with the
256,INTRODUCTION,"greatest pages of 'Sister Songs' sounding in one's ears, one is"
257,INTRODUCTION,sometimes tempted to think the 'Hound of Heaven' Mr. Thompson's
258,INTRODUCTION,high-water mark for unimaginable beauty and tremendous import--if we do
259,INTRODUCTION,"damnably iterate Mr. Thompson's tremendousness, we cannot help it, he"
260,INTRODUCTION,thrusts the word upon us.  We do not think we forget any of the
261,INTRODUCTION,splendid things of an English anthology when we say that the 'Hound of
262,INTRODUCTION,"Heaven' seems to us, on the whole, the most wonderful lyric (if we"
263,INTRODUCTION,consider 'Sister Songs' as a sequence of lyrics) in the language.  It
264,INTRODUCTION,"fingers all the stops of the spirit, and we hear now a thrilling and"
265,INTRODUCTION,dolorous note of doom and now the quiring of the spheres and now the
266,INTRODUCTION,"very pipes of Pan, but under all the still sad music of humanity.  It"
267,INTRODUCTION,is the return of the nineteenth century to Thomas √† Kempis....  The
268,INTRODUCTION,"regal air, the prophetic ardors, the apocalyptic vision, Mr. Thompson"
269,INTRODUCTION,"has them all.  A rarer, more intense, more strictly predestinate genius"
270,INTRODUCTION,has never been known to poetry.  To many this will seem the simple
271,INTRODUCTION,"delirium of over-emphasis.  The writer signs for those others, nowise"
272,INTRODUCTION,"ashamed, who range after Shakespeare's very Sonnets the poetry of a"
273,INTRODUCTION,"living poet, Francis Thompson."""
274,INTRODUCTION,
275,INTRODUCTION,We do not associate Mr. Arnold Bennett with any of the ideas in
276,INTRODUCTION,religion or literature which supplied impulse to Francis Thompson.  It
277,INTRODUCTION,is a surprise of the first magnitude to find him carried away into the
278,INTRODUCTION,"rapture of prophecy by the ""Sister Songs.""  ""I declare,"" he says in an"
279,INTRODUCTION,"article appearing in July, 1895, ""that for three days after this book"
280,INTRODUCTION,appeared I read nothing else.  I went about repeating snatches of
281,INTRODUCTION,it--snatches such as--
282,INTRODUCTION,
283,INTRODUCTION,"'The innocent moon, that nothing does but shine,"
284,INTRODUCTION,Moves all the labouring surges of the world.'
285,INTRODUCTION,
286,INTRODUCTION,"My belief is that Francis Thompson has a richer natural genius, a finer"
287,INTRODUCTION,"poetical equipment, than any poet save Shakespeare.  Show me the"
288,INTRODUCTION,"divinest glories of Shelley and Keats, even of Tennyson, who wrote the"
289,INTRODUCTION,"'Lotus Eaters' and the songs in the 'Princess,' and I think I can match"
290,INTRODUCTION,"them all out of this one book, this little book that can be bought at"
291,INTRODUCTION,an ordinary bookseller's shop for an ordinary prosaic crown.  I fear
292,INTRODUCTION,"that in thus extolling Francis Thompson's work, I am grossly outraging"
293,INTRODUCTION,"the canons of criticism.  For the man is alive, he gets up of a morning"
294,INTRODUCTION,"like common mortals, not improbably he eats bacon for breakfast; and"
295,INTRODUCTION,every critic with an atom of discretion knows that a poet must not be
296,INTRODUCTION,"called great until he is dead or very old.  Well, please yourself what"
297,INTRODUCTION,"you think.  But, in time to come, don't say I didn't tell you.""  A"
298,INTRODUCTION,whole generation of men has passed away since these words appeared; but
299,INTRODUCTION,they do not seem to be so fantastic and whimsical now as they seemed to
300,INTRODUCTION,be then.
301,INTRODUCTION,
302,INTRODUCTION,[Illustration: I said to dawn: Be sudden  _Page 47_]
303,INTRODUCTION,
304,INTRODUCTION,"It can scarcely be claimed that the prophecies of Meredith, Mr. Garvin,"
305,INTRODUCTION,and Mr. Arnold Bennett were of the kind which ultimately assures the
306,INTRODUCTION,event.  The reading-world dipped curiously into the pages about which
307,INTRODUCTION,there was so much conflict of opinion; it was startled and bewildered
308,INTRODUCTION,by a novel and difficult form of verse; and finally it agreed with the
309,INTRODUCTION,majority of critics that it was mostly nonsense--too Catholic to be
310,INTRODUCTION,"catholic.  The poems sold badly, the 'Hound of Heaven' faring best.  It"
311,INTRODUCTION,is a common mark of genius to be ahead of its time.  Even Thompson's
312,INTRODUCTION,"coreligionists were cold.  Indeed, it may be said they were the"
313,INTRODUCTION,coldest.  If the general reading-public of the nineties suspected
314,INTRODUCTION,"Thompson of being a Victorian reactionary of ultra-montane mould, the"
315,INTRODUCTION,Catholic public feared him for his art.  It was a wild unfettered thing
316,INTRODUCTION,which took strange liberties with Catholic pieties and could not be
317,INTRODUCTION,trusted to run in divine grooves.  One can afford to extenuate the
318,INTRODUCTION,attitude of reserve.  It was a period when brilliant heterodoxies and
319,INTRODUCTION,"flaunting decadence were in the air.  The fact is, that critics and"
320,INTRODUCTION,public delivered Thompson over to the Catholics; and the Catholics
321,INTRODUCTION,would have nothing to do with him.  Canon Sheehan could write of
322,INTRODUCTION,Thompson in 1898:
323,INTRODUCTION,
324,INTRODUCTION,"""Only two Catholics--literary Catholics--have noticed this surprising"
325,INTRODUCTION,genius--Coventry Patmore and Wilfrid Meynell.  The vast bulk of our
326,INTRODUCTION,"coreligionists have not even heard his name, although it is already"
327,INTRODUCTION,"bruited amongst the Immortals; and the great Catholic poet, for whose"
328,INTRODUCTION,"advent we have been straining our vision, has passed beneath our eyes,"
329,INTRODUCTION,"sung his immortal songs, and vanished.""  This was written almost ten"
330,INTRODUCTION,"years before Thompson died, but after his resolve to write no more"
331,INTRODUCTION,poetry.
332,INTRODUCTION,
333,INTRODUCTION,"It is easily within the probabilities that, small as was Thompson's"
334,INTRODUCTION,"audience during his lifetime, it would have been still smaller but for"
335,INTRODUCTION,the extraneous interest excited by the strange story of his life.  He
336,INTRODUCTION,"was born on December 16, 1859, in Preston, Lancashire, whence he went"
337,INTRODUCTION,"at the age of eleven to Ushaw College, a Catholic boarding school for"
338,INTRODUCTION,boys.  This is the college where Lafcadio Hearn received his education;
339,INTRODUCTION,he had left the school a year or two before young Thompson's arrival.
340,INTRODUCTION,Both boys were designed for the priesthood.  Hearn lost his faith then
341,INTRODUCTION,or shortly afterwards: Thompson's irregular habits of dreamy
342,INTRODUCTION,abstraction rendered him unfit for a sacerdotal career.  When he had
343,INTRODUCTION,"completed his course at college, where he had distinguished himself in"
344,INTRODUCTION,"English composition and attained respectable standing in the classics,"
345,INTRODUCTION,"his father, a hard-working physician, entered the lad, now eighteen, as"
346,INTRODUCTION,"a student of medicine in Owen College, Manchester.  The Thompson family"
347,INTRODUCTION,"had moved from Preston to Ashton-under-Lyne, where proximity to"
348,INTRODUCTION,Manchester made it possible for the young medical student to spend his
349,INTRODUCTION,nights at home.
350,INTRODUCTION,
351,INTRODUCTION,Francis was of the silent and secretive sort where he could not hope to
352,INTRODUCTION,"find intelligent sympathy.  This, and some cloudy compromise with his"
353,INTRODUCTION,"sense of filial dutifulness, will perhaps explain why he passed six"
354,INTRODUCTION,years as a student of medicine without any serious purpose of becoming
355,INTRODUCTION,a physician and without informing his father of his disinclination.
356,INTRODUCTION,Three examinations and three failures at intervals of a year were
357,INTRODUCTION,necessary to convince the father of the true state of affairs.  Stern
358,INTRODUCTION,"measures were adopted; and, although the consequences were pitifully"
359,INTRODUCTION,"tragical, it is hard to blame the father of Francis.  How are we to"
360,INTRODUCTION,discover the extraordinary seal in a case that requires special and
361,INTRODUCTION,extraordinary treatment?
362,INTRODUCTION,
363,INTRODUCTION,Francis was twenty-four years old with no more idea than a child's of
364,INTRODUCTION,how life is planned on practical lines of prosperity.  The senior
365,INTRODUCTION,Thompson thought it time for him to learn and issued orders to find
366,INTRODUCTION,employment of some remunerative kind.  Accordingly during the next two
367,INTRODUCTION,years Francis served indifferently for brief periods as a clerk in the
368,INTRODUCTION,shop of a maker of surgical instruments and as a canvasser of an
369,INTRODUCTION,encyclopedia.  Both experiments in the art of making a living were
370,INTRODUCTION,"failures, increasing paternal dissatisfaction.  The desperate young man"
371,INTRODUCTION,"then enlisted in the army, and after a few weeks' of drilling was"
372,INTRODUCTION,rejected on the score of physical weakness.

378,INTRODUCTION,
379,INTRODUCTION,During these shiftless and unhappy years as a listless medical student
380,INTRODUCTION,and laggard apprentice the poet's chief solace was the public library
381,INTRODUCTION,of Manchester.  In his daily absences from home his misery suggested
382,INTRODUCTION,another solace of a sinister kind.  After a severe illness during his
383,INTRODUCTION,"second year of medicine his mother, says his biographer, presented him"
384,INTRODUCTION,"with a copy of De Quincey's ""Confessions of an Opium Eater.""  It is"
385,INTRODUCTION,"incredible that a _helluo librorum_, like Thompson, should have reached"
386,INTRODUCTION,the age of twenty without ever having read a book which is one of the
387,INTRODUCTION,first to attract every bright school-boy.  This would be particularly
388,INTRODUCTION,"true of a school-boy who lived near Manchester, De Quincey's own town."
389,INTRODUCTION,But the evidence seems to be against probabilities.  Thompson succumbed
390,INTRODUCTION,completely to the influence of the great genius whose temper and
391,INTRODUCTION,circumstances of life were singularly like his own.  Experiments in
392,INTRODUCTION,laudanum were made and habits contracted which accentuated a natural
393,INTRODUCTION,unfitness to wrestle with the practical problems of getting on and
394,INTRODUCTION,rendered family intercourse drearier than ever.
395,INTRODUCTION,
396,INTRODUCTION,"In 1885, when he was twenty-six years old, Francis decided to leave"
397,INTRODUCTION,home.  After a week in Manchester he requested and received from his
398,INTRODUCTION,father the price of a railway ticket for London.  The trip to the vast
399,INTRODUCTION,and strange city must have been made with only the vaguest of plans for
400,INTRODUCTION,the future.  The despairing youth seemed to have no other purpose than
401,INTRODUCTION,to rid his father of his vexatious presence.  There were friends in
402,INTRODUCTION,"London, on one of whom Francis was directed to call for a weekly"
403,INTRODUCTION,allowance from home.  But a temperamental reluctance kept the young man
404,INTRODUCTION,"away from those who could help him, and even the weekly allowance after"
405,INTRODUCTION,"a while came to be unclaimed.  The rough, cyclonic forces of the huge"
406,INTRODUCTION,city caught this helpless child of a man's years in the full swing of
407,INTRODUCTION,their blind sweep and played sad tricks with him.  In a period
408,INTRODUCTION,extending over nearly three years Francis Thompson led the life of a
409,INTRODUCTION,vagrant in the streets and alleys.  He made one or two brave essays at
410,INTRODUCTION,"regular work of the most commonplace character, but without success."
411,INTRODUCTION,The worn copies of Aeschylus and Blake in the pockets of this ragged
412,INTRODUCTION,and gaunt roustabout contained no useful hints for the difficulties of
413,INTRODUCTION,the peculiar situation; its harshness could be transmuted into
414,INTRODUCTION,temporary and blessed oblivion by a drug whenever the means for
415,INTRODUCTION,purchase could be acquired.  The Guildhall Library was much frequented
416,INTRODUCTION,"until shabbiness was excluded by the policeman.  This outcast poet,"
417,INTRODUCTION,"approaching thirty years of age, was at various times a bootblack, a"
418,INTRODUCTION,"newsboy, a vendor of matches, a nocturnal denizen of wharves and"
419,INTRODUCTION,lounger on the benches of city-parks.  His cough-racked frame was the
420,INTRODUCTION,exposed target of cold and rain and winds.  He became used to hunger.
421,INTRODUCTION,"At one time a six-pence, for holding a horse, was his only earnings for"
422,INTRODUCTION,a week.  It was while he was aimlessly roaming the streets one night
423,INTRODUCTION,"almost delirious from starvation that a prosperous shoe-merchant,"
424,INTRODUCTION,"benevolently engaged in religious rescue-work, came across Thompson,"
425,INTRODUCTION,"and, struck by the incongruity of his gentle speech, induced him to"
426,INTRODUCTION,accept employment in his shop.  But one cannot allow business to suffer
427,INTRODUCTION,"on account of an inveterate blunderer, even though the blunderer wear"
428,INTRODUCTION,"wings and has endeared himself to the family.  Mr. McMaster, kindly"
429,INTRODUCTION,"Anglican lay-missionary, who deserves grateful remembrance for"
430,INTRODUCTION,recognizing and temporarily helping merit under the most deceptive
431,INTRODUCTION,"disguise, was obliged much against his inclination to dismiss Francis"
432,INTRODUCTION,and to allow him to fall back into the pit of squalor and vagabondage.
433,INTRODUCTION,
434,INTRODUCTION,But the few months of reprieve had supplied Thompson with the impulse
435,INTRODUCTION,to write.  Shortly after he was dropped from the McMaster establishment
436,INTRODUCTION,"Mr. Wilfrid Meynell, the editor of _Merry England_, a Catholic"
437,INTRODUCTION,"magazine, received the following letter: ""_Feb. 23rd, '87_--Dear"
438,INTRODUCTION,"Sir,--In enclosing the accompanying article for your inspection, I must"
439,INTRODUCTION,"ask pardon for the soiled state of the manuscript.  It is due, not to"
440,INTRODUCTION,"slovenliness, but to the strange places and circumstances under which"
441,INTRODUCTION,"it has been written.  For me, no less than Parolles, the dirty nurse"
442,INTRODUCTION,experience has something fouled.  I enclose stamped envelope for a
443,INTRODUCTION,"reply, since I do not desire the return of the manuscript, regarding"
444,INTRODUCTION,your judgment of its worthlessness as quite final.  I can hardly expect
445,INTRODUCTION,"that where my prose fails my verse will succeed.  Nevertheless, on the"
446,INTRODUCTION,"principle of 'Yet will I try the last,' I have added a few specimens of"
447,INTRODUCTION,"it, with the off chance that one may be less poor than the rest."

463,INTRODUCTION,"The unpromising aspect of the manuscript, thus introduced, was the"
464,INTRODUCTION,occasion of editorial neglect for some months.  When at last Mr.
465,INTRODUCTION,Meynell gave it his attention he was electrified into action.  He wrote
466,INTRODUCTION,to the address given by Thompson.  The letter was returned from the
467,INTRODUCTION,dead-letter office after many days.  Then he published one of the poems
468,INTRODUCTION,"mentioned in the letter, ""The Passion of Mary,"" in the hope that the"
469,INTRODUCTION,author would disclose his whereabouts.  The plan succeeded and brought
470,INTRODUCTION,a letter from Thompson with a new address.  Mr. Meynell tried to waylay
471,INTRODUCTION,"him at the new address, a chemist's shop in Drury Lane, but with"
472,INTRODUCTION,characteristic shiftlessness the poet forgot to call there for possible
473,INTRODUCTION,letters.  But the seller of drugs finally established communications
474,INTRODUCTION,"between the editor and the poet, and one day, more than a year after"
475,INTRODUCTION,"Thompson's first literary venture had been sent, he visited the office"
476,INTRODUCTION,"of _Merry England_.  Mr. Everard Meynell, the poet's biographer, thus"
477,INTRODUCTION,"describes the entrance of the poet into his father's sanctum.  ""My"
478,INTRODUCTION,"father was told that Mr. Thompson wished to see him.  'Show him up,' he"
479,INTRODUCTION,"said, and was left alone.  Then the door opened, and a strange hand was"
480,INTRODUCTION,"thrust in.  The door closed, but Thompson had not entered.  Again it"
481,INTRODUCTION,"opened, again it shut.  At the third attempt a waif of a man came in."
482,INTRODUCTION,No such figure had been looked for; more ragged and unkempt than the
483,INTRODUCTION,"average beggar, with no shirt beneath his coat and bare feet in broken"
484,INTRODUCTION,"shoes, he found my father at a loss for words.  'You must have had"
485,INTRODUCTION,"access to many books when you wrote that essay,' was what he said."
486,INTRODUCTION,"'That,' said Thompson, his shyness at once replaced by an acerbity that"
487,INTRODUCTION,afterwards became one of the most familiar of his never-to-be-resented
488,INTRODUCTION,"mannerisms, 'that is precisely where the essay fails.  I had no books"
489,INTRODUCTION,by me at the time save Aeschylus and Blake.' There was little to be
490,INTRODUCTION,done for him at that interview save the extraction of a promise to call
491,INTRODUCTION,again.  He made none of the confidences characteristic of a man seeking
492,INTRODUCTION,sympathy and alms.  He was secretive and with no eagerness for plans
493,INTRODUCTION,"for his benefit, and refused the offer of a small weekly sum that would"
494,INTRODUCTION,"enable him to sleep in a bed and sit at a table."""
495,INTRODUCTION,
496,INTRODUCTION,By patience and delicately offered kindnesses Mr. and Mrs. Meynell at
497,INTRODUCTION,"length won the difficult privilege of helping the shy, nervous,"
498,INTRODUCTION,"high-strung spirit wandering in pain, hunger and exile amid the"
499,INTRODUCTION,indecencies of extreme penury in a great city.  They were helped by the
500,INTRODUCTION,friendly sympathy and care of Premonstratensian and Franciscan monks.
501,INTRODUCTION,"Thompson had sounded, and become familiar with, the depths of social"
502,INTRODUCTION,degradation in all its external aspects of sordidness.  The most
503,INTRODUCTION,extraordinary part of his singular experience is that he affords a
504,INTRODUCTION,striking instance of the triumph of soul and mind over beleaguering
505,INTRODUCTION,circumstance.  The nightmare of his environment failed to subdue him.
506,INTRODUCTION,"He preserved his spiritual sensitiveness, and literary ideals of a most"
507,INTRODUCTION,"exalted kind, through the most depressing and demoralizing experiences."
508,INTRODUCTION,"The following passage in that first essay offered to Mr. Meynell,"
509,INTRODUCTION,"entitled ""Paganism: Old and New,"" a vindication of Christian over pagan"
510,INTRODUCTION,"ideals in art, shows the rich, colorful tone of mind of one who could"
511,INTRODUCTION,"walk unstained among the world's impurities.  ""Bring back then, I say,"
512,INTRODUCTION,"in conclusion, even the best age of Paganism, and you smite beauty on"
513,INTRODUCTION,"the cheek.  But you _cannot_ bring back the best age of Paganism, the"
514,INTRODUCTION,age when Paganism was a faith.  None will again behold Apollo in the
515,INTRODUCTION,"forefront of the morning, or see Aphrodite in the upper air loose the"
516,INTRODUCTION,long lustre of her golden locks.  But you _may_ bring back--_dii
517,INTRODUCTION,"avertant omen_--the Paganism of the days of Pliny, and Statius, and"
518,INTRODUCTION,"Juvenal; of much philosophy, and little belief; of superb villas and"
519,INTRODUCTION,"superb taste; of banquets for the palate in the shape of cookery, and"
520,INTRODUCTION,banquets for the eye in the shape of art; of poetry singing dead songs
521,INTRODUCTION,on dead themes with the most polished and artistic vocalisation; of
522,INTRODUCTION,"everything most polished, from the manners to the marble floors; of"
523,INTRODUCTION,"vice carefully drained out of sight, and large fountains of virtue"
524,INTRODUCTION,"springing in the open air;--in one word, a most shining Paganism"
525,INTRODUCTION,"indeed--as putrescence also shines.""  Unlike George Gissing and so many"
526,INTRODUCTION,others who had to wade to celebrity through sloughs of bitter
527,INTRODUCTION,"destitution, Francis Thompson felt no inclination to capitalize his"
528,INTRODUCTION,expert knowledge of back streets and alleys for profit and the morbid
529,INTRODUCTION,entertainment of the curious.  His single failing in yielding to the
530,INTRODUCTION,attraction of an insidious drug seemed to be impotent to affect his
531,INTRODUCTION,high admirations and his clear perceptions in the regions of honor and
532,INTRODUCTION,religion.

539,INTRODUCTION,It is surely one of the literary glories of a distinguished family that
540,INTRODUCTION,Mr. and Mrs. Meynell succeeded in helping Thompson to emancipate
541,INTRODUCTION,himself from the enslavement of a tyrannic habit.  His poetic genius
542,INTRODUCTION,began to flower in the new liberty.  For the next ten years interest in
543,INTRODUCTION,"his poetry and literary friends and connections, few and select, made"
544,INTRODUCTION,his life comparatively happy.  But he maintained a large measure of
545,INTRODUCTION,independence to the last.  That he was never ungrateful to those who
546,INTRODUCTION,"befriended him, his poems are ample proof.  But in London he always had"
547,INTRODUCTION,his own lodgings in a cheap but respectable quarter of the city.  His
548,INTRODUCTION,unpunctual and preoccupied manner sometimes created small distresses
549,INTRODUCTION,for his devoted friends to relieve.  During the last ten years of his
550,INTRODUCTION,"life he wrote little poetry.  His vitality, never vigorous, was ebbing"
551,INTRODUCTION,and unequal to the demands of inspired verse.  But during these years
552,INTRODUCTION,of decline he wrote much golden prose.  He was a regular and highly
553,INTRODUCTION,"valued contributor to the _Academy_, the _Athenaeum_, the _Nation_, and"
554,INTRODUCTION,the _Daily Chronicle_.  One can hardly fail to be impressed by the mere
555,INTRODUCTION,industry of a writer of reputed slack habits of work.  The published
556,INTRODUCTION,"volume of his selected essays is literary criticism, as learned and"
557,INTRODUCTION,"allusive as Matthew Arnold's, and as nicely poised, with the advantage"
558,INTRODUCTION,of being poised in more rarified heights than Arnold's wings could hope
559,INTRODUCTION,to scale.  In this book is his classic and most wonderful essay on
560,INTRODUCTION,"Shelley, written before his strength began to flag, in which prose"
561,INTRODUCTION,"seems to be carried off its feet, as it were, in a very storm of poetic"
562,INTRODUCTION,impulse.  The published essays are not a tithe of Thompson's writings
563,INTRODUCTION,"for the press.  Moreover, we have a study of Blessed John de la Salle,"
564,INTRODUCTION,"a little volume on ""Health and Holiness,"" and a large ""Life of St."
565,INTRODUCTION,"Ignatius Loyola,"" none of them suggesting even remotely the plantigrade"

576,INTRODUCTION,"The ""Hound of Heaven"" has been called the greatest ode in the English"
577,INTRODUCTION,language.  Such was the contemporary verdict of some of the most
578,INTRODUCTION,"respected critics of the time, and the conviction of its justness"
579,INTRODUCTION,"deepens with the passing of years.  Recall the writers of great odes,"
580,INTRODUCTION,"Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Collins, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley,"
581,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge,--the best they have done will not outstare the ""Hound of"
582,INTRODUCTION,"Heaven.""  Where shall we find its equal for exaltation of mood that"
583,INTRODUCTION,knows no fatigue from the first word to the last?  The motion of
584,INTRODUCTION,"angelic hosts must be like the movement of this ode, combining in some"
585,INTRODUCTION,marvellous and mysterious way the swiftness of lightning with the
586,INTRODUCTION,stately progress of a pageant white with the blinding white light of an
587,INTRODUCTION,awful Presence.  The note of modernness is the quality which is most
588,INTRODUCTION,likely to mislead us in forecasting favorably the durability of
589,INTRODUCTION,"contemporary poetry, appealing as it does to so many personal issues"
590,INTRODUCTION,irrelevant to the standards of immortal art.  This is precisely the
591,INTRODUCTION,"note which is least conspicuous in the ""Hound of Heaven.""  The poem"
592,INTRODUCTION,"might have been written in the days of Shakespeare, or, in a different"
593,INTRODUCTION,"speech, by Dante or Calderon.  The Rev. Francis P. LeBuffe, S. J., has"
594,INTRODUCTION,"written an interesting book on the ""Hound of Heaven,"" pointing out the"

596,INTRODUCTION,"the late Rev. J. F. X. O'Connor, in a published ""Study"" of the poem,"
597,INTRODUCTION,"says that in it Francis Thompson ""seems to sing, in verse, the thought"
598,INTRODUCTION,"of St. Ignatius in the spiritual exercises,--the thought of St. Paul in"

616,INTRODUCTION,"speech.  He strove after an enfranchisement of utterance, devoid of"

618,INTRODUCTION,"understood of all.  A soul-shaking thought, prevalent throughout"
619,INTRODUCTION,"Christendom, was felt imaginatively by a highly endowed poet, and, like"

621,INTRODUCTION,"boulders of mountain in their red release, found magnificent expression"

644,INTRODUCTION,"seem to have over-reached Himself in disclosing His power and majesty,"

646,INTRODUCTION,weight of the evidences of His Infinity.  We have modern thinkers
647,INTRODUCTION,regarding Christian notions of the Godhead as impossible to a mind
648,INTRODUCTION,acquainted with the paralyzing revelations of scientific knowledge.
649,INTRODUCTION,The late John Fiske used to deride what he called the anthromorphism of
650,INTRODUCTION,"the Christian idea of God, as of a venerable, white-bearded man.  And"
651,INTRODUCTION,these philosophers deem it more reverent to deny any personal
652,INTRODUCTION,relationship between God and man for the reason that God is too great

654,INTRODUCTION,
655,INTRODUCTION,"Before indicating the essential error of this attitude, it is necessary"

657,INTRODUCTION,"Christian conception of the Godhead, as expressed by St. Thomas"
658,INTRODUCTION,"Aquinas, Dante, Lessius, and a host of Christian writers, has never"
659,INTRODUCTION,been approached in its sublime suggestions of Infinite and Eternal
660,INTRODUCTION,power and glory by any modern philosopher.  In the second and third
661,INTRODUCTION,"Lectures of Cardinal Newman's, ""Scope and Nature of University"

688,INTRODUCTION,prepare us to expect equally tremendous manifestations of His
689,INTRODUCTION,attributes of love.  The more prodigal God is discovered to be in
690,INTRODUCTION,"lavish expenditures of omnipotence in the material universe, the more"
691,INTRODUCTION,alert the soul becomes to look for and to detect overwhelming surprises
692,INTRODUCTION,"of Divine Love.  Hence, to Thompson there was nothing irrational in the"
693,INTRODUCTION,"special revelation of God to man, in His Incarnation, His death on the"

695,INTRODUCTION,"God's love, as displayed in the supernatural revelation of Himself,"
696,INTRODUCTION,seems to be even vaster and more intense than the Divine energy of
697,INTRODUCTION,creation displayed in the revelation of nature.  Every new revelation
698,INTRODUCTION,of God's power and wisdom which science unfolds serves only to restore

705,INTRODUCTION,and completely as if there were no one else and nothing else to see
706,INTRODUCTION,"except us.  Practically speaking, God gives each one of us His"
707,INTRODUCTION,undivided attention.  And through this spacious channel of His Divine
708,INTRODUCTION,and exclusive attention pour the ocean-tides of His love.  The weak
709,INTRODUCTION,soul is afraid of the terrible excess of Divine Love.  It tries to
710,INTRODUCTION,"elude it; but Love meets it at every cross-road and by-path, down which"
711,INTRODUCTION,"it would run and hide itself, and gently turns it back."

713,INTRODUCTION,"Francis Thompson, in an interpretation of ""A Narrow Vessel,"" has left"

716,INTRODUCTION,"the ""Hound of Heaven."" ""Though God,"" he says, ""asks of the soul but to"
717,INTRODUCTION,"love Him what it may, and is ready to give an increased love for a poor"
718,INTRODUCTION,"little, the soul feels that this infinite love demands naturally its"
719,INTRODUCTION,"whole self, that if it begin to love God it may not stop short of all"
720,INTRODUCTION,"it has to yield.  It is troubled, even if it did go a brief way, on the"
721,INTRODUCTION,"upward path; it fears and recoils from the whole great surrender, the"
722,INTRODUCTION,constant effort beyond itself which is sensibly laid on it.  It falls
723,INTRODUCTION,"back with relieved contentment on some human love, a love on its own"
724,INTRODUCTION,"plane, where somewhat short of total surrender may go to requital,"
725,INTRODUCTION,where no upward effort is needful.  And it ends by giving for the
726,INTRODUCTION,"meanest, the most unsufficing and half-hearted return, that utter"
727,INTRODUCTION,self-surrender and self-effacement which it denied to God.  Even (how
728,INTRODUCTION,"rarely) if the return be such as mortal may render, how empty and"
729,INTRODUCTION,unsatiated it leaves the soul.  One always is less generous to love
730,INTRODUCTION,"than the other."""
731,INTRODUCTION,
732,INTRODUCTION,"God walks morning, noon and eve in the garden of the soul, calling it"
733,INTRODUCTION,to a happiness which affrights it.  And the timid and self-seeking soul
734,INTRODUCTION,"strives to hide itself under the stars, under the clouds of heaven,"
735,INTRODUCTION,"under human love, under the distractions of work and pleasure and"
736,INTRODUCTION,"study, offers itself as a wistful servitor to child and man and nature,"
737,INTRODUCTION,if they will but afford it a refuge from the persistent and gentle
738,INTRODUCTION,"accents of pursuivant Love.  But all things are in league with God, Who"
739,INTRODUCTION,made and rules them.  They cannot conspire against Him.  They betray
740,INTRODUCTION,"the refugee.  He turns in abject surrender, and is astonished to find"

742,INTRODUCTION,thwartings which had harassed the soul become a tender mystery of
743,INTRODUCTION,Infinite Love forcing itself upon an unworthy and unwilling creature.

848,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,
849,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I pleaded, out law-wise,"
850,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"By many a hearted casement, curtained red,"
851,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Trellised with intertwining charities
852,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"(For, though I knew His love Who follow√®d,"
853,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Yet was I sore adread
854,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Lest, having Him, I must have naught beside);"
855,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But, if one little casement parted wide,"
856,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,The gust of His approach would clash it to.
857,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.
858,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Across the margent of the world I fled,"
859,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,"
860,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Smiting for shelter on their clang√®d bars;
861,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Fretted to dulcet jars
862,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And silvern chatter the pale ports o' the moon.
863,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I said to dawn: Be sudden; to eve: Be soon--
864,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,With thy young skyey blossoms heap me over
865,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From this tremendous Lover!
866,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Float thy vague veil about me, lest He see!"
867,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I tempted all His servitors, but to find"
868,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"My own betrayal in their constancy,"
869,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"In faith to Him their fickleness to me,"
870,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Their traitorous trueness, and their loyal deceit."
871,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,To all swift things for swiftness did I sue;
872,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Clung to the whistling mane of every wind.
873,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But whether they swept, smoothly fleet,"
874,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,The long savannahs of the blue;
875,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Or whether, Thunder-driven,"
876,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,They clanged His chariot 'thwart a heaven
877,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn o' their feet:--
878,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.
879,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Still with unhurrying chase,"
880,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And unperturb√®d pace,"

896,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I sought no more that after which I strayed
897,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,In face of man or maid;
898,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,But still within the little children's eyes
899,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Seems something, something that replies,"
900,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"_They_ at least are for me, surely for me!"
901,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I turned me to them very wistfully;
902,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair
903,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With dawning answers there,"
904,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.

913,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Let me greet you lip to lip,"
914,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Let me twine with you caresses,"
915,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Wantoning
916,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With our Lady-Mother's vagrant tresses,"
917,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Banqueting
918,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With her in her wind-walled palace,"
919,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Underneath her azured da√Øs,"
920,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Quaffing, as your taintless way is,"
921,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From a chalice
922,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Lucent-weeping out of the dayspring."""
923,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,So it was done;
924,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,_I_ in their delicate fellowship was one--
925,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Drew the bolt of Nature's secrecies.
926,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,_I_ knew all the swift importings
927,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,On the wilful face of skies;
928,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I knew how the clouds arise,"
929,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Spum√®d of the wild sea-snortings;
930,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,All that's born or dies
931,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Rose and drooped with; made them shapers
932,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Of mine own moods, or wailful or divine--"
933,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,With them joyed and was bereaven.
934,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I was heavy with the even,"
935,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,When she lit her glimmering tapers
936,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Round the day's dead sanctities.
937,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I laughed in the morning's eyes.
938,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,"
939,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Heaven and I wept together,"
940,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine;
941,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Against the red throb of its sunset-heart
942,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I laid my own to beat,"
943,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And share commingling heat;
944,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But not by that, by that, was eased my human smart."
945,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,In vain my tears were wet on Heaven's grey cheek.
946,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"For ah! we know not what each other says,"
947,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,These things and I; in sound _I_ speak--
948,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"_Their_ sound is but their stir, they speak by silences."
949,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Nature, poor stepdame, cannot slake by drouth;"
950,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Let her, if she would owe me,"
951,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Drop yon blue bosom-veil of sky, and show me"
952,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,The breasts o' her tenderness:
953,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Never did any milk of hers once bless
954,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,My thirsting mouth.
955,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Nigh and nigh draws the chase,"
956,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With unperturb√®d pace,"
957,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,"
958,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And past those nois√®d Feet
959,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,A Voice comes yet more fleet--

974,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Naked I wait Thy love's uplifted stroke!
975,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"My harness piece by piece Thou hast hewn from me,"
976,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And smitten me to my knee;
977,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I am defenceless utterly.
978,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I slept, methinks, and woke,"
979,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And, slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep."
980,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"In the rash lustihead of my young powers,"
981,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I shook the pillaring hours
982,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And pulled my life upon me; grimed with smears,"
983,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I stand amid the dust o' the mounded years--
984,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.
985,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,"
986,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.
987,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Yea, faileth now even dream"
988,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"The dreamer, and the lute the lutanist;"
989,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Even the linked fantasies, in whose blossomy twist"
990,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I swung the earth a trinket at my wrist,"
991,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Are yielding; cords of all too weak account
992,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"For earth, with heavy griefs so overplussed."
993,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Ah! is Thy love indeed
994,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"A weed, albeit an amaranthine weed,"
995,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?
996,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Ah! must--
997,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Designer infinite!--
998,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Ah! must Thou char the wood ere Thou canst limn with it?
999,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,My freshness spent its wavering shower i' the dust;
1000,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And now my heart is as a broken fount,"
1001,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever"
1002,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From the dank thoughts that shiver
1003,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Upon the sighful branches of my mind.
1004,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Such is; what is to be?
1005,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind?"
1006,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds;
1007,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Yet ever and anon a trumpet sounds
1008,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From the hid battlements of Eternity:

1010,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Round the half-glimps√®d turrets slowly wash again;
1011,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,But not ere Him who summoneth
1012,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I first have seen, enwound"
1013,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And now my heart is as a broken fount,"
1014,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever"
1015,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From the dank thoughts that shiver
1016,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With glooming robes purpureal, cypress-crowned;"
1017,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"His name I know, and what his trumpet saith."
1018,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Whether man's heart or life it be which yields

1040,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest Me!"
1041,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Strange, piteous, futile thing,"
1042,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Wherefore should any set thee love apart?
1043,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Seeing none but I makes much of naught"" (He said),"
1044,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""And human love needs human meriting:"
1045,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,How hast thou merited--
1046,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Of all man's clotted clay the dingiest clot?
1047,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Alack, thou knowest not"
1048,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,How little worthy of any love thou art!
1049,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee,"

1051,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"All which I took from thee I did but take,"
1052,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Not for thy harms,"
1053,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,But just that thou might'st seek it in My arms.
1054,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,All which thy child's mistake
1055,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Fancies as lost, I have stored for thee at home:"
