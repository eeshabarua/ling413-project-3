54,FOREWORD,
55,FOREWORD,"How many of us are conscious of the subtle melodies, ""through which the"
56,FOREWORD,"myriad lispings of the earth find perfect speech""?"
57,FOREWORD,
58,FOREWORD,Our poets are listeners; their ears are tuned to the magic call of
59,FOREWORD,secret voices that we who are not singers may never hear. They capture
60,FOREWORD,"the ""Melody"" in chalices of song, and their message is: that whosoever"
61,FOREWORD,"will bend his ear to earth, may hear from field and furrow, from the"
62,FOREWORD,many-bladed grass and the soft-petalled flowers--in the soughing of the
63,FOREWORD,pine tree or the rustle of leaves--an immortal music that revivifies the
64,FOREWORD,soul.
65,FOREWORD,
66,FOREWORD,"In the quiet tilled spots of earth, from time immemorial, men have sown"
67,FOREWORD,rare seeds of poetic thought that have flowered into song. Amiel wrote
68,FOREWORD,"in his _Journal_: ""All seed-sowing is a mysterious thing whether the"
69,FOREWORD,"seed fall into earth or into souls; man is a husbandman, and his work"
70,FOREWORD,"rightly understood is to develop life, to sow it everywhere."" The poets"
71,FOREWORD,"are our seed-sowers, and _their_ work is to develop life and to enrich"
72,FOREWORD,it. They are never happier than when writing about gardens and the
73,FOREWORD,growing things of earth--at once their symbol and their solace. In turn
74,FOREWORD,gardens have in the poets their happiest interpreters.
75,FOREWORD,
76,FOREWORD,Here I have culled and gathered together songs and poems that reflect
77,FOREWORD,the melody and harmony of Nature's forces. In these days of the world's
78,FOREWORD,"travail, let us seek inspiration and content within the delightful"
79,FOREWORD,confines of these Gardens of Poetry.

2099,JUNE,Among the alders by the stream I heard a partridge drumming;
2100,JUNE,"I heard a partridge drumming, June, a welcome with his wings,"
2101,JUNE,And felt a softness in the air half Summer's and half Spring's.
2102,JUNE,
2103,JUNE,"I knew that you were nearing, June, I knew that you were nearing--"
2104,JUNE,I saw it in the bursting buds of roses in the clearing;
2105,JUNE,"The roses in the clearing, June, were blushing pink and red,"
2106,JUNE,For they had heard upon the hills the echo of your tread.
2107,JUNE,
2108,JUNE,"I knew that you were coming, June, I knew that you were coming,"
2109,JUNE,For ev'ry warbler in the wood a song of joy was humming.

2119,JUNE RAPTURE,"Panting for beauty long denied,"
2120,JUNE RAPTURE,Leaps in a passion of high gratitude
2121,JUNE RAPTURE,To meet the wild embraces of the wood;
2122,JUNE RAPTURE,Rushes and flings itself upon the whole
2123,JUNE RAPTURE,"Mad miracle of green, with senses wide,"
2124,JUNE RAPTURE,"Clings to the glory, hugs and holds it fast,"
2125,JUNE RAPTURE,As one who finds a long-lost love at last.
2126,JUNE RAPTURE,Billows of green that break upon the sight
2127,JUNE RAPTURE,"In bounteous crescendos of delight,"
2128,JUNE RAPTURE,Wind-hurried verdure hastening up the hills
2129,JUNE RAPTURE,To where the sun its highest rapture spills;
2130,JUNE RAPTURE,Cascades of color tumbling down the height
2131,JUNE RAPTURE,In golden gushes of delicious light--
2132,JUNE RAPTURE,"God! Can I bear the beauty of this day,"
2133,JUNE RAPTURE,Or shall I be swept utterly away?
2134,JUNE RAPTURE,
2135,JUNE RAPTURE,"Hush--here are deeps of green, where rapture stills,"
2136,JUNE RAPTURE,Sheathing itself in veils of amber dusk;
2137,JUNE RAPTURE,"Breathing a silence suffocating, sweet,"
2138,JUNE RAPTURE,Wherein a million hidden pulses beat.
2139,JUNE RAPTURE,Look! How the very air takes fire and thrills
2140,JUNE RAPTURE,With hint of heaven pushing through her husk.
2141,JUNE RAPTURE,"Ah, joy's not stopped! 'Tis only more intense,"
2142,JUNE RAPTURE,Here where Creation's ardors all condense;
2143,JUNE RAPTURE,"Here where I crush me to the radiant sod,"
2144,JUNE RAPTURE,Close-folded to the very nerves of God.
2145,JUNE RAPTURE,See now--I hold my heart against this tree.
2146,JUNE RAPTURE,The life that thrills its trembling leaves thrills me.
2147,JUNE RAPTURE,There's not a pleasure pulsing through its veins
2148,JUNE RAPTURE,That does not sting me with ecstatic pains.
2149,JUNE RAPTURE,"No twig or tracery, however fine,"
2150,JUNE RAPTURE,Can bear a tale of joy exceeding mine.
2151,JUNE RAPTURE,
2152,JUNE RAPTURE,Praised be the gods that made my spirit mad;
2153,JUNE RAPTURE,Kept me aflame and raw to beauty's touch.
2154,JUNE RAPTURE,Lashed me and scourged me with the whip of fate;
2155,JUNE RAPTURE,Gave me so often agony for mate;
2156,JUNE RAPTURE,Tore from my heart the things that make men glad--
2157,JUNE RAPTURE,"Praised be the gods! If I at last, by such"
2158,JUNE RAPTURE,"Relentless means may know the sacred bliss,"
2159,JUNE RAPTURE,The anguished rapture of an hour like this.
2160,JUNE RAPTURE,"Smite me, O Life, and bruise me if thou must;"
2161,JUNE RAPTURE,"Mock me and starve me with thy bitter crust,"
2162,JUNE RAPTURE,"But keep me thus aquiver and awake,"
2163,JUNE RAPTURE,Enamoured of my life for living's sake!
2164,JUNE RAPTURE,"_This were the tragedy_--that I should pass,"
2165,JUNE RAPTURE,Dull and indifferent through the glowing grass.
2166,JUNE RAPTURE,"And this the reason I was born, I say--"

3699,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Always with vague suggestions of delight.
3700,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Stairways and Gardens. Mystery and grace
3701,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Seem part of their environment; they fill all space
3702,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,With memories of things veiled from my sight
3703,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,In some far place.
3704,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,
3705,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Gardens. The word is overcharged with meaning;
3706,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,"It speaks of moonlight, and a closing door;"
3707,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Of birds at dawn--of sultry afternoons.
3708,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Gardens. I seem to see low branches screening
3709,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,A vine-roofed arbor with a leaf-tiled floor
3710,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Where sunlight swoons.
3711,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,
3712,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,"Stairways. The word winds upward to a landing,"
3713,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Then curves and vanishes in space above.
3714,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,"Lights fall, lights rise; soft lights that meet and blend."
3715,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Stairways; and some one at the bottom standing
3716,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Expectantly with lifted looks of love.
3717,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Then steps descend.
3718,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,
3719,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,Gardens and Stairways. They belong with song--
3720,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,"With subtle scents of perfume, myrrh and musk--"
3721,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,"With dawn and dusk--with youth, romance, and mystery,"
3722,STAIRWAYS AND GARDENS,And times that were and times that are to be.

8464,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden;
8465,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,and in the garden a new sepulchre.... The first day of the
8466,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,week cometh Mary Magdalene early ... unto the sepulchre....
8467,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"And ... she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing...."
8468,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith"

8470,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,
8471,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"From silvering mid-sea to the Syrian sand,"

8473,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"On field and hill and down the steep ravine,"
8474,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Ran foam and fire of bloom and ripple of green.
8475,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"The Sepulchre was open wide, and thrown"
8476,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"Among the crushed, hurt lilies lay the Stone."
8477,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,A light wind stirred the Garden: everywhere
8478,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,The smell of myrrh was out upon the air.
8479,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"For three days He had traveled with the dead,"
8480,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,And now was risen to go with stiller tread
8481,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"The old earth ways again,"
8482,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,To stay the heart and build the hope of men.
8483,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"He made a luster in that leafy place,"

8487,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,
8488,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,The cold gray east was warming into rose

8490,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Now suddenly on the morning faint with flame
8491,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Jerusalem with all her clamors came--
8492,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"A snarl of noises from the far-off street,"
8493,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Dispute and barter and the clack of feet.
8494,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,A moment it brawled upward and was gone--
8495,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"Faded, forgotten in the deep still dawn."
8496,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"He passed across the morning: felt the cool,"
8497,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"Keen, kindling air blown upward from the pool."
8498,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,A busy wind brought little tender smells
8499,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,From barley fields and weeds by April wells.
8500,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Up in the tree-tops where the breezes ran
8501,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,The old sweet noises in the nests began;
8502,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,And once He paused to listen while a bird
8503,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Shouted the joy till all the Garden heard.
8504,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,
8505,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"There in the morning, on the old worn ways--"
8506,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,New-risen from the sacrament of death--
8507,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,He looked toward Olivet with tender gaze:
8508,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Old things of the heart came back from other days--
8509,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"The happy, homely shop in Nazareth;"
8510,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,The noonday shadow of a wayside tree
8511,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,That had befriended Him in Galilee;
8512,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"Sweet talks in Bethany by the chimney stone,"
8513,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,And night-long lingering talks with John alone.
8514,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,And then He thought of all the weary men
8515,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,He would have gathered as a mother hen
8516,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Gathers her brood under her wings at night.
8517,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"And then He saw the ages in one flight,"
8518,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,And heard as a great sea
8519,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,All of the griefs that had been and must be....
8520,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,
8521,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"As He stood looking on the endless sky,"
8522,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,Over the Garden went a sobbing cry.
8523,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"He turned, and saw where the tall almonds are"
8524,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"His Mary of Magdala, wildly pale,"
8525,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,"Fast-fleeting down the trail,"
8526,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,And suddenly His face was like a star!
8527,BEFORE MARY OF MAGDALA CAME,He spoke; she knew--a blaze of happy tears;
