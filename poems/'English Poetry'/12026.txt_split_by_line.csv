19,PRESS NOTICES,Mr. Freeman's landscapes have an individuality which entitles him to his
20,PRESS NOTICES,"own place as a poet of nature.... The appreciation of his lofty ardours,"
21,PRESS NOTICES,"his desolate landscapes and his strange, though beautiful, rhythms and"
22,PRESS NOTICES,"forms of verse, is not one which springs up instantly in the mind; but"
23,PRESS NOTICES,once it has arisen it does not diminish.--_New Statesman_.
24,PRESS NOTICES,
25,PRESS NOTICES,"I think that whatever limitations our age and our poetry may have, Mr."
26,PRESS NOTICES,"Freeman's poetry, and much else that is now being written, will find in"
27,PRESS NOTICES,all succeeding generations readers to whom it will give companionship
28,PRESS NOTICES,"and comfort.--Mr. J.C. Squire, in _Land and Water_."
29,PRESS NOTICES,
30,PRESS NOTICES,This book must be read steadily through; quotation can reveal little of
31,PRESS NOTICES,"its scope, its richness.... When a man, in poems that are clearly"
32,PRESS NOTICES,"fragments of autobiography, thus surrenders to the world the life of his"
33,PRESS NOTICES,"spirit, the beauty of what he writes is inseparable from its truth."
34,PRESS NOTICES,"Truth endures, and a prophet would have a sad foreboding of posterity if"
35,PRESS NOTICES,he did not believe that of this day's poets Mr. Freeman will not be
36,PRESS NOTICES,among the forgotten.--_Times Literary Supplement_.
37,PRESS NOTICES,
38,PRESS NOTICES,This rarefied air is something to which the reader must adjust himself;
39,PRESS NOTICES,but he finds the process of adjustment made easy by a peculiar
40,PRESS NOTICES,fascination in the atmosphere which Mr. Freeman creates. If it is aloof
41,PRESS NOTICES,"from ordinary experience, it is by so much the more individual; and in"
42,PRESS NOTICES,"it there are to be found thrills and feelings, an understanding of a"
43,PRESS NOTICES,"particular aspect of nature, which have not hitherto been reported in"
44,PRESS NOTICES,poetry--_Westminster Gazette_.

75,NOTE.,With the exception of two or three poems which have appeared in
76,NOTE.,"newspapers, or in an anthology entitled _Twelve Poets_, the verses in"
77,NOTE.,the first part of this volume have not hitherto been printed. The second
78,NOTE.,"part contains _Memories of Childhood and Other Poems_, and the third"
79,NOTE.,"part retrieves many verses from _Presage of Victory_ (1916), _Stone"
80,NOTE.,"Trees_ (1916), _Fifty Poems_ (1911) and _Twenty Poems_ (1909)."
81,NOTE.,"Chronological order has not been carefully observed, or avoided, in the"
82,NOTE.,"arrangement of the third part, but the earlier pieces will easily be"
83,NOTE.,distinguished by those who may wish to distinguish them.

310,THE EVENING SKY,
311,THE EVENING SKY,
312,THE EVENING SKY,Rose-bosom'd and rose-limb'd
313,THE EVENING SKY,With eyes of dazzling bright
314,THE EVENING SKY,Shakes Venus mid the twinèd boughs of the night;
315,THE EVENING SKY,"Rose-limb'd, soft-stepping"
316,THE EVENING SKY,From low bough to bough
317,THE EVENING SKY,Shaking the wide-hung starry fruitage--dimmed
318,THE EVENING SKY,Its bloom of snow
319,THE EVENING SKY,By that sole planetary glow.
320,THE EVENING SKY,
321,THE EVENING SKY,"Venus, avers the astronomer,"
322,THE EVENING SKY,Not thus idly dancing goes
323,THE EVENING SKY,Flushing the eternal orchard with wild rose.
324,THE EVENING SKY,She through ether burns
325,THE EVENING SKY,"Outpacing planetary earth,"
326,THE EVENING SKY,"And ere two years triumphantly returns,"
327,THE EVENING SKY,"And again wave-like swelling flows,"
328,THE EVENING SKY,And again her flashing apparition comes and goes.
329,THE EVENING SKY,
330,THE EVENING SKY,"This we have not seen,"
331,THE EVENING SKY,"No heavenly courses set,"
332,THE EVENING SKY,No flight unpausing through a void serene:
333,THE EVENING SKY,"But when eve clears,"
334,THE EVENING SKY,Arises Venus as she first uprose
335,THE EVENING SKY,"Stepping the shaken boughs among,"
336,THE EVENING SKY,And in her bosom glows
337,THE EVENING SKY,The warm light hidden in sunny snows.
338,THE EVENING SKY,
339,THE EVENING SKY,She shakes the clustered stars
340,THE EVENING SKY,"Lightly, as she goes"
341,THE EVENING SKY,"Amid the unseen branches of the night,"
342,THE EVENING SKY,"Rose-limb'd, rose-bosom'd bright."
343,THE EVENING SKY,She leaps: they shake and pale; she glows--
344,THE EVENING SKY,And who but knows
345,THE EVENING SKY,How the rejoiced heart aches
346,THE EVENING SKY,When Venus all his starry vision shakes;
347,THE EVENING SKY,
348,THE EVENING SKY,When through his mind
349,THE EVENING SKY,"Tossing with random airs of an unearthly wind,"
350,THE EVENING SKY,"Rose-bosom'd, rose-limb'd,"
351,THE EVENING SKY,"The mistress of his starry vision arises,"
352,THE EVENING SKY,And the boughs glittering sway
353,THE EVENING SKY,"And the stars pale away,"
354,THE EVENING SKY,And the enlarging heaven glows
355,THE EVENING SKY,As Venus light-foot mid the twinèd branches goes.

361,BEECHWOOD,
362,BEECHWOOD,
363,BEECHWOOD,"Hear me, O beeches! You"
364,BEECHWOOD,That have with ageless anguish slowly risen
365,BEECHWOOD,From earth's still secret prison
366,BEECHWOOD,Into the ampler prison of aery blue.
367,BEECHWOOD,"Your voice I hear, flowing the valleys through"
368,BEECHWOOD,After the wind that tramples from the west.
369,BEECHWOOD,After the wind your boughs in new unrest
370,BEECHWOOD,"Shake, and your voice--one voice uniting voices"
371,BEECHWOOD,A thousand or a thousand thousand--flows
372,BEECHWOOD,Like the wind's moody; glad when he rejoices
373,BEECHWOOD,"In swift-succeeding and diminishing blows,"
374,BEECHWOOD,And drooping when declines death's ardour in his breast;
375,BEECHWOOD,Then over him exhausted weaving the soft fan-like noises
376,BEECHWOOD,Of gentlest creaking stems and soothing leaves
377,BEECHWOOD,"Until he rest,"
378,BEECHWOOD,And silent too your easied bosom heaves.
379,BEECHWOOD,
380,BEECHWOOD,That high and noble wind is rootless nor
381,BEECHWOOD,"From stable earth sucks nurture, but roams on"
382,BEECHWOOD,"Childless as fatherless, wild, unconfined,"
383,BEECHWOOD,"So that men say, ""As homeless as the wind!"""
384,BEECHWOOD,Rising and falling and rising evermore
385,BEECHWOOD,"With years like ticks, æons as centuries gone;"
386,BEECHWOOD,Only within impalpable ether bound
387,BEECHWOOD,And blindly with the green globe spinning round.
388,BEECHWOOD,"He, noble wind,"
389,BEECHWOOD,"Most ancient creature of imprisoned Time,"
390,BEECHWOOD,"From high to low may fall, and low to high may climb,"
391,BEECHWOOD,"Andean peak to deep-caved southern sea,"
392,BEECHWOOD,"With lifted hand and voice of gathered sound,"
393,BEECHWOOD,And echoes in his tossing quiver bound
394,BEECHWOOD,And loosed from height into immensity;
395,BEECHWOOD,"Yet of his freedom tires, remaining free."
396,BEECHWOOD,"--Moulding and remoulding imponderable cloud,"
397,BEECHWOOD,Uplifting skiey archipelagian isles
398,BEECHWOOD,"Sunnier than ocean's, blue seas and white isles"
399,BEECHWOOD,Aflush with blossom where late sunlight glowed;--
400,BEECHWOOD,"Still of his freedom tiring yet still free,"
401,BEECHWOOD,"Homelessly roaming between sky, earth and sea."
402,BEECHWOOD,
403,BEECHWOOD,"But you, O beeches, even as men, have root"
404,BEECHWOOD,Deep in apparent and substantial things--
405,BEECHWOOD,"Earth, sun, air, water, and the chemic fruit"
406,BEECHWOOD,Wise Time of these has made. What laughing Springs
407,BEECHWOOD,Your branches sprinkle young leaf-shadows o'er
408,BEECHWOOD,That wanting the leaf-shadows were no Springs
409,BEECHWOOD,Of seasonable sweet and freshness! nor
410,BEECHWOOD,If Summer of your murmur gathered not
411,BEECHWOOD,"Increase of music as your leaves grow dense,"
412,BEECHWOOD,Might even kine and birds and general noise of wings
413,BEECHWOOD,"Of summer make full Summer, but the hot"
414,BEECHWOOD,Slow moons would pass and leave unsatisfied the sense.
415,BEECHWOOD,Nor Autumn's waste were dear if your gold snow
416,BEECHWOOD,Of leaves whirled not upon the gold below;
417,BEECHWOOD,Nor Winter's snow were loveliness complete
418,BEECHWOOD,Wanting the white drifts round your breasts and feet.
419,BEECHWOOD,To hills how many has your tossed green given
420,BEECHWOOD,Likeness of an inverted cloudy heaven;
421,BEECHWOOD,How many English hills enlarge their pride
422,BEECHWOOD,Of shape and solitude
423,BEECHWOOD,By beechwoods darkening the steepest side!
424,BEECHWOOD,I know a Mount--let there my longing brood
425,BEECHWOOD,"Again, as oft my eyes--a Mount I know"
426,BEECHWOOD,Where beeches stand arrested in the throe
427,BEECHWOOD,Of that last onslaught when the gods swept low
428,BEECHWOOD,Against the gods inhabiting the wood.
429,BEECHWOOD,"Gods into trees did pass and disappear,"
430,BEECHWOOD,"Then closing, body and huge members heaved"
431,BEECHWOOD,With energy and agony and fear.
432,BEECHWOOD,"See how the thighs were strained, how tortured here."
433,BEECHWOOD,"See, limb from limb sprung, pain too sore to bear."
434,BEECHWOOD,Eyes once looked from those sockets that no eyes
435,BEECHWOOD,"Have worn since--oh, with what desperate surprise!"
436,BEECHWOOD,"These arms, uplifted still, were raised in vain"
437,BEECHWOOD,Against alien triumph and the inward pain.
438,BEECHWOOD,"Unlock your arms, and be no more distressed,"
439,BEECHWOOD,Let the wind glide over you easily again.
440,BEECHWOOD,"It is a dream you fight, a memory"
441,BEECHWOOD,Of battle lost. And how should dreaming be
442,BEECHWOOD,Still a renewed agony?
443,BEECHWOOD,"But O, when that wind comes up out of the west"
444,BEECHWOOD,New-winged with Autumn from the distant sea
445,BEECHWOOD,"And springs upon you, how should not dreaming be"
446,BEECHWOOD,A remembered and renewing agony?
447,BEECHWOOD,"Then are your breasts, O unleaved beeches, again"
448,BEECHWOOD,"Torn, and your thighs and arms with the old strain"
449,BEECHWOOD,Stretched past endurance; and your groans I hear
450,BEECHWOOD,Low bent beneath the hoofs by that fierce charioteer
451,BEECHWOOD,Driven clashing over; till even dreaming is
452,BEECHWOOD,Less of a present agony than this.
453,BEECHWOOD,
454,BEECHWOOD,"Fall gentler sleep upon you now, while soft"
455,BEECHWOOD,Airs circle swallow-like from hedge to croft
456,BEECHWOOD,Below your lowest naked-rooted troop.
457,BEECHWOOD,Let evening slowly droop
458,BEECHWOOD,Into the middle of your boughs and stoop
459,BEECHWOOD,Quiet breathing down to your scarce-quivering side
460,BEECHWOOD,And rest there satisfied.
461,BEECHWOOD,
462,BEECHWOOD,Yet sleep herself may wake
463,BEECHWOOD,"And through your heavy unlit dome, O Mount of beeches, shake."
464,BEECHWOOD,Then shall your massy columns yield
465,BEECHWOOD,Again the company all day concealed....
466,BEECHWOOD,Is it their shapes that sweep
467,BEECHWOOD,Serene within the ambit of the Moon
468,BEECHWOOD,Sentinel'd by shades slow-marching with moss-footed hours that creep
469,BEECHWOOD,"From dusk of night to dusk of day--slow-marching, yet too soon"
470,BEECHWOOD,Approaching morn? Are these their grave
471,BEECHWOOD,Remembering ghosts?
472,BEECHWOOD,"... Already your full-foliaged branches wave,"
473,BEECHWOOD,And the thin failing hosts
474,BEECHWOOD,Into your secrecies are swift withdrawn
475,BEECHWOOD,Before the certain footsteps of the dawn.
476,BEECHWOOD,
477,BEECHWOOD,"But you, O beeches, even as men have root"
478,BEECHWOOD,Deep in apparent and substantial things.
479,BEECHWOOD,"Birds on your branches leap and shake their wings,"
480,BEECHWOOD,Long ere night falls the soft owl loosens her slow hoot
481,BEECHWOOD,From the unfathomed fountains of your gloom.
482,BEECHWOOD,"Late western sunbeams on your broad trunks bloom,"
483,BEECHWOOD,"Levelled from the low opposing hill, and fold"
484,BEECHWOOD,Your inmost conclave with a burning gold.
485,BEECHWOOD,"... Than those night-ghosts awhile more solid, men"
486,BEECHWOOD,Pass within your sharp shade that makes an arctic night
487,BEECHWOOD,"Of common light,"
488,BEECHWOOD,"And pause, swift measuring tree by tree; and then"
489,BEECHWOOD,"Paint their vivid mark,"
490,BEECHWOOD,Ciphering fatality on each unwrinkled bark
491,BEECHWOOD,Across the sunken stain
492,BEECHWOOD,That every season's gathered streaming rain
493,BEECHWOOD,Has deepened to a darker grain.
494,BEECHWOOD,You of this fatal sign unconscious lift
495,BEECHWOOD,"Your branches still, each tree her lofty tent;"
496,BEECHWOOD,Still light and twilight drift
497,BEECHWOOD,"Between, and lie in wan pools silver sprent."
498,BEECHWOOD,"But comes a day, a step, a voice, and now"
499,BEECHWOOD,"The repeated stroke, the noosed and tethered bough,"
500,BEECHWOOD,The sundered trunk upon the enormous wain
501,BEECHWOOD,"Bound kinglike with chain over chain,"
502,BEECHWOOD,New wounded and exposed with each old stain.
503,BEECHWOOD,And here small pools of doubtful light are lakes
504,BEECHWOOD,Shadowless and no more that rude bough-music wakes.
505,BEECHWOOD,
506,BEECHWOOD,"So on men too the indifferent woodman, Time,"
507,BEECHWOOD,"Servant of unseen Master, nearing sets"
508,BEECHWOOD,His unread symbol--or who reads forgets;
509,BEECHWOOD,"And suns and seasons fall and climb,"
510,BEECHWOOD,"Leaves fall, snows fall, Spring flutters after Spring,"
511,BEECHWOOD,A generation a generation begets.
512,BEECHWOOD,But comes a day--though dearly the tough roots cling
513,BEECHWOOD,"To common earth, branches with branches sing--"
514,BEECHWOOD,"And that obscure sign's read, or swift misread,"
515,BEECHWOOD,By the indifferent woodman or his slave
516,BEECHWOOD,"Disease, night-wandered from a fever-dripping cave."
517,BEECHWOOD,"No chain's then needed for no fearful king,"
518,BEECHWOOD,But light earth-fall on foot and hand and head.
519,BEECHWOOD,
520,BEECHWOOD,Now thick as stars leaves shake within the dome
521,BEECHWOOD,Of faintly-glinting dusking monochrome;
522,BEECHWOOD,And stars thick hung as leaves shake unseen in the round
523,BEECHWOOD,"Of darkening blue: the heavenly branches wave without a sound,"
524,BEECHWOOD,Only betrayed by fine vibration of thin air.
525,BEECHWOOD,"Gleam now the nearer stars and ghosts of farther stars that bare,"
526,BEECHWOOD,"Trembling and gradual, brightness everywhere...."
527,BEECHWOOD,"When leaves fall wildly and your beechen dome is thinned,"
528,BEECHWOOD,Showered glittering down under the sudden wind;
529,BEECHWOOD,"And when you, crowded stars, are shaken from your tree"
530,BEECHWOOD,"In time's late season stripped, and each bough nakedly"
531,BEECHWOOD,Rocks in those gleamless shallows of infinity;
532,BEECHWOOD,"When star-fall follows leaf-fall, will long Winter pass away"
533,BEECHWOOD,And new stars as new leaves dance through their hasty May?
534,BEECHWOOD,--But as a leaf falls so falls weightless thought
535,BEECHWOOD,"Eddying, and with a myriad dead leaves lies"
536,BEECHWOOD,"Bewildered, or in a little air awhile is caught"
537,BEECHWOOD,"Idly, then drops and dies."
538,BEECHWOOD,
539,BEECHWOOD,"Look at the stars, the stars! But in this wood"
540,BEECHWOOD,All I can understand is understood.
541,BEECHWOOD,Gentler than stars your beeches speak; I hear
542,BEECHWOOD,Syllables more simple and intimately clear
543,BEECHWOOD,"To earth-taught sense, than the heaven-singing word"
544,BEECHWOOD,Of that intemperate wisdom which the sky
545,BEECHWOOD,"Shakes down upon each unregarding century,"
546,BEECHWOOD,"There lying like snow unstirred,"
547,BEECHWOOD,"Unmelting, on the loftiest peak"
548,BEECHWOOD,Above our human and green valley ways.
549,BEECHWOOD,Lowlier and friendlier your beechen branches speak
550,BEECHWOOD,To men of mortal days
551,BEECHWOOD,"With hearts too fond, too weak"
552,BEECHWOOD,For solitude or converse with that starry race.
553,BEECHWOOD,"Their shaken lights,"
554,BEECHWOOD,Their lonely splendours and uncomprehended
555,BEECHWOOD,Dream-distance and long circlings 'mid the heights
556,BEECHWOOD,And deeps remotely neighboured and attended
557,BEECHWOOD,By spheres that spill their fire through these estranging nights:--
558,BEECHWOOD,"Ah, were they less dismaying, or less splendid!"
559,BEECHWOOD,But as one deaf and mute sees the lips shape
560,BEECHWOOD,"And quiver as men talk, or marks the throat"
561,BEECHWOOD,"Of rising song that he can never hear,"
562,BEECHWOOD,"Though in the singer's eyes her joy may dimly peer,"
563,BEECHWOOD,And song and word his hopeless sense escape--
564,BEECHWOOD,Sweet common word and lifted heavenly note--
565,BEECHWOOD,"So, beneath that bright rain,"
566,BEECHWOOD,"While stars rise, soar and stoop,"
567,BEECHWOOD,Dazzled and dismayed I look and droop
568,BEECHWOOD,"And, blinded, look again."
569,BEECHWOOD,
570,BEECHWOOD,"""Return, return!"" O beeches sing you then."
571,BEECHWOOD,"I like a tree wave all my thoughts with you,"
572,BEECHWOOD,As your boughs wave to other tossed boughs when
573,BEECHWOOD,First in the windy east the dawn looks through
574,BEECHWOOD,Night's soon-dissolving bars.
575,BEECHWOOD,"Return, return? But I have never strayed:"
576,BEECHWOOD,"Hush, thoughts, that for a moment played"
577,BEECHWOOD,In that enchanted forest of the stars
578,BEECHWOOD,Where the mind grows numb.
579,BEECHWOOD,"Return, return?"
580,BEECHWOOD,"Back, thoughts, from heights that freeze and deeps that burn,"
581,BEECHWOOD,Where sight fails and song's dumb.
582,BEECHWOOD,"And as, after long absence, a child stands"
583,BEECHWOOD,In each familiar room
584,BEECHWOOD,And with fond hands
585,BEECHWOOD,"Touches the table, casement, bed,"
586,BEECHWOOD,"Anon each sleeping, half-forgotten toy;"
587,BEECHWOOD,So I to your sharp light and friendly gloom
588,BEECHWOOD,"Returning, with first pale leaves round me shed,"
589,BEECHWOOD,Recover the old joy
590,BEECHWOOD,"Since here the long-acquainted hill-path lies,"
591,BEECHWOOD,"Steeps I have clambered up, and spaces where"
592,BEECHWOOD,The Mount opens her bosom to the air
593,BEECHWOOD,And all around gigantic beeches rise.

666,THE CAVES,In the cave's night to keep
667,THE CAVES,Eternal motion grave and deep;--
668,THE CAVES,

670,THE CAVES,Its answered knocking and with bruised hand beats
671,THE CAVES,"Again, again, again,"
672,THE CAVES,Tossed between ecstasy and pain;
673,THE CAVES,
674,THE CAVES,"Still in the folded hollow darkness swells,"
675,THE CAVES,"Sinks, swells, and every green-hung hollow fills,"
676,THE CAVES,Till there's no room for sound
677,THE CAVES,Save that old anger rolled around;
678,THE CAVES,
679,THE CAVES,"So into every hollow cliff of life,"
680,THE CAVES,"Into this heart's deep cave so loud with strife,"
681,THE CAVES,"In tunnels I knew not,"

687,THE CAVES,Muted those time-breathing airs.
688,THE CAVES,

733,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"In those old days you were called beautiful,"
734,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,But I have worn the beauty from your face;
735,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,The flowerlike bloom has withered on your cheek
736,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"With the harsh years, and the fire in your eyes"
737,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Burns darker now and deeper, feeding on"
738,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Beauty and the remembrance of things gone.

746,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Deepens slowly into blood-like light:--
747,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"So did you flame and in flame take delight,"
748,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,So are you hollow'd now with aching fire.
749,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"But I still warm me and make there my home,"
750,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,Still beauty and youth burn there invisibly
751,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,For me.
752,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,
753,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Now my lips falling on your silver'd skull,"
754,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"My fingers in the valleys of your cheeks,"
755,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Or my hands in your thin strong hands fast caught,"
756,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Your body clutched to mine, mine bent to yours:"
757,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Now love undying feeds on love beautiful,"
758,IN THOSE OLD DAYS,"Now, now I am but thought kissing your thought ..."

769,THE ASH,The undecaying yew has shed his flowers
770,THE ASH,Long since in golden showers.
771,THE ASH,The elm has robed her height
772,THE ASH,"In green, and hangs maternal o'er the bright"
773,THE ASH,"Starred meadows, and her full-contented breast"
774,THE ASH,Lifts and sinks to rest.
775,THE ASH,Shades drowsing in the grass
776,THE ASH,Beneath the hedge move but as the hours pass.
777,THE ASH,"Beech, oak and beam have all put beauty on"
778,THE ASH,In the eye of the sun.
779,THE ASH,Because the hawthorn's sweet
780,THE ASH,"All the earth is sweet and the air, and the wind's feet."
781,THE ASH,"In the wood's green hollows the earth is sweet and wet,"
782,THE ASH,For scarce one shaft may get
783,THE ASH,The sudden green between:
784,THE ASH,Only that warm sweet creeps between the green;
785,THE ASH,Or in the clearing the bluebells lifting high
786,THE ASH,Make another azure sky.
787,THE ASH,
788,THE ASH,All's leaf and flower except
789,THE ASH,"The sluggish ash that all night long has slept,"
790,THE ASH,And all the morning of this lingering spring.
791,THE ASH,"Every tree else may sing,"
792,THE ASH,Every bough laugh and shake;
793,THE ASH,But the ash like an old man does not wake
794,THE ASH,Even though draws near the season's poise and noon
795,THE ASH,Of heavy-poppied swoon ...
796,THE ASH,"Still the ash is asleep,"
797,THE ASH,Or from his lower upraised palms now creep
798,THE ASH,"First green leaves, promising that even those gaunt"
799,THE ASH,Tossed boughs shall be the haunt
800,THE ASH,Of Autumn starlings shrill
801,THE ASH,Mid his full-leaved high branches never still.
802,THE ASH,
803,THE ASH,"If to any tree,"
804,THE ASH,'Tis to the ash that I might likened be--
805,THE ASH,"Masculine, unamenable, delaying,"
806,THE ASH,With palms uplifted praying
807,THE ASH,For another life and Spring
808,THE ASH,Yet unforeshadowed; but content to swing

930,THE VISIT,
931,THE VISIT,I reached the cottage. I knew it from the card
932,THE VISIT,"He had given me--the low door heavily barred,"
933,THE VISIT,"Steep roof, and two yews whispering on guard."
934,THE VISIT,
935,THE VISIT,"Dusk thickened as I came, but I could smell"
936,THE VISIT,"First red wallflower and an early hyacinth bell,"
937,THE VISIT,"And see dim primroses. ""O, I can tell,"""
938,THE VISIT,
939,THE VISIT,"I thought, ""they love the flowers he loved."" The rain"

942,THE VISIT,
943,THE VISIT,"Bare was the window yet, and the lamp bright."
944,THE VISIT,"I saw them sitting there, streamed with the light"

947,THE VISIT,"""Poor things, I wonder why they've lit up so,"""
948,THE VISIT,"A voice said, passing on the road below."
949,THE VISIT,"""Who are they?"" asked another. ""Don't you know?"""
950,THE VISIT,
951,THE VISIT,Their voices crept away. I heard no more
952,THE VISIT,As I crossed the garden and knocked at the door.
953,THE VISIT,"I waited, then knocked louder than before,"
954,THE VISIT,
955,THE VISIT,"And thrice, and still in vain. So on the grass"
956,THE VISIT,"I stepped, and tap-tapped on the rainy glass."
957,THE VISIT,Then did a girl without turning towards me pass
958,THE VISIT,
959,THE VISIT,"From the room. I heard the heavy barred door creak,"
960,THE VISIT,"And a voice entreating from the doorway speak,"
961,THE VISIT,"""Will you come this way?""--a voice childlike and quick."
962,THE VISIT,
963,THE VISIT,"The way was dark. I followed her white frock,"
964,THE VISIT,"Past the now-chiming, sweet-tongued unseen clock,"
965,THE VISIT,Into the room. One figure like a rock
966,THE VISIT,
967,THE VISIT,Draped in an unstarred night--his mother--bowed
968,THE VISIT,Unrising and unspeaking. His aunt stood
969,THE VISIT,"And took my hand, murmuring, ""So good, so good!"""
970,THE VISIT,
971,THE VISIT,Never such quiet people had I known.
972,THE VISIT,"Voices they scarcely needed, they had grown"
973,THE VISIT,To talk less by the word than muted tone.
974,THE VISIT,
975,THE VISIT,"""We'll soon have tea,"" the girl said. ""Please sit here."""
976,THE VISIT,She pushed a heavy low deep-seated chair
977,THE VISIT,I knew at once was his; and I sat there.
978,THE VISIT,
979,THE VISIT,I could not look at them. It seemed I made
980,THE VISIT,Noise in that quietness. I was afraid
981,THE VISIT,"To look or speak until the aunt's voice said,"
982,THE VISIT,
983,THE VISIT,"""You were his friend."" And that ""You were!"" awoke"
984,THE VISIT,"My sense, and nervousness found voice and spoke"
985,THE VISIT,"Of what he had been, until a bullet broke"
986,THE VISIT,
987,THE VISIT,A too-brief friendship. The rock-like mother kept
988,THE VISIT,"Night still around her. The aunt silently wept,"
989,THE VISIT,And the girl into the screen's low shadow stept.
990,THE VISIT,
991,THE VISIT,"""You were great friends,"" said with calm voice the mother."
992,THE VISIT,"I answered, ""Never friend had such another."""
993,THE VISIT,"Then the girl's lips, ""Nor sister such a brother."""
994,THE VISIT,
995,THE VISIT,Her words were like a sounding pebble cast
996,THE VISIT,Into a hollow silence; but at last
997,THE VISIT,She moved and bending to my low chair passed
998,THE VISIT,
999,THE VISIT,"Swift leaf-like fingers o'er my face and said,"
1000,THE VISIT,"""You are not like him."" And as she turned her head"
1001,THE VISIT,Into full light beneath the lamp's green shade
1002,THE VISIT,
1003,THE VISIT,I saw the sunken spaces of her eyes.
1004,THE VISIT,Then her face listening to my dumb surprise.
1005,THE VISIT,"""Forgive,"" she said, ""a blind girl's liberties."""
1006,THE VISIT,
1007,THE VISIT,"""You were his friend; I wanted so to see"
1008,THE VISIT,"The friends my brother had. Now let's have tea."""
1009,THE VISIT,"She poured, and passed a cup and cakes to me."
1010,THE VISIT,
1011,THE VISIT,"""These are my cakes,"" she smiled; and as I ate"
1012,THE VISIT,"She talked, and to the others cup and plate"
1013,THE VISIT,Passed as they in their shadow and silence sat.
1014,THE VISIT,
1015,THE VISIT,"""Thanks, we are used to each other,"" she said when I"
1016,THE VISIT,"Rose in the awkwardness of seeing, shy"
1017,THE VISIT,Of helping and of watching helplessly.
1018,THE VISIT,
1019,THE VISIT,And from the manner of their hands 'twas clear
1020,THE VISIT,They too were blind; but I knew they could hear
1021,THE VISIT,My pitiful thoughts as I sat aching there.
1022,THE VISIT,
1023,THE VISIT,"... I needs must talk, until the girl was gone"
1024,THE VISIT,"A while out of the room. The lamp shone on,"
1025,THE VISIT,But the true light out of the room was gone.
1026,THE VISIT,
1027,THE VISIT,"""Rose loved him so!"" her mother said, and sighed."
1028,THE VISIT,"""He was our eyes, he was our joy and pride,"
1029,THE VISIT,"And all that's left is but to say he died."""
1030,THE VISIT,
1031,THE VISIT,She ceased as Rose returned. Then as before
1032,THE VISIT,"We talked and paused until, ""Tell me once more,"
1033,THE VISIT,"What was it he said?"" And I told her once more."
1034,THE VISIT,
1035,THE VISIT,She listened: in her face was pride and pain
1036,THE VISIT,As in her mind's eye near he stood and plain....
1037,THE VISIT,Then the thin leaves fell on my cheek again
1038,THE VISIT,
1039,THE VISIT,"And on my hands. ""He must have loved you well,"""
1040,THE VISIT,"She whispered, as her hands from my hands fell."
1041,THE VISIT,Silence flowed back with thoughts unspeakable.
1042,THE VISIT,
1043,THE VISIT,It was a painful thing to leave them there
1044,THE VISIT,Within the useless light and stirless air.
1045,THE VISIT,"""Let me show you the way. Mind, there's a stair"
1046,THE VISIT,
1047,THE VISIT,"""Here, then another stair ten paces on...."
1048,THE VISIT,"Isn't there a moon? Good-bye."""
1049,THE VISIT,And she was gone.
1050,THE VISIT,Full moon upon the drenched fruit garden shone.

1143,IV,What hope to the old inheritance restored!
1144,IV,Thy praise it is that men at last are glad.
1145,IV,Long unaccustomed brightness in their eyes
1146,IV,"Needs must seem beautiful in thine, bright Lord,"
1147,IV,And to forget the part that sorrow had
1148,IV,"In every shadowed breast, where still it lies,"

1249,OUT OF THE EAST,"And speech knew, and the company of speech,"

1262,OUT OF THE EAST,Thinning with time and thirst and so were gone
1263,OUT OF THE EAST,Forgotten; when between each wandered host

1266,OUT OF THE EAST,"In those old days, upon the soft dew'd sward"
1267,OUT OF THE EAST,"That held its green between the thicket's cloud,"
1268,OUT OF THE EAST,Walked two men musing ere the wide moon poured
1269,OUT OF THE EAST,Her full-girthed weightless flood. And one was bowed
1270,OUT OF THE EAST,"With years past knowledge, and his face was scored"
1271,OUT OF THE EAST,Where light or deep had every long year ploughed--
1272,OUT OF THE EAST,"Pain, labour, present peril, distant dread"
1273,OUT OF THE EAST,Scored in his brow and bending his shagged head.
1274,OUT OF THE EAST,
1275,OUT OF THE EAST,Palsy his frame shook as a harsh wind shakes
1276,OUT OF THE EAST,Complaining reeds fringing a frozen river;

1278,OUT OF THE EAST,Whereunder the foiled waters swirl and quiver;
1279,OUT OF THE EAST,His voice the deep note that the north wind takes
1280,OUT OF THE EAST,Drawn through bare beechwoods where forlorn birds shiver--

1288,OUT OF THE EAST,Confused with other blood; and what will be
1289,OUT OF THE EAST,"I groping cannot tell, and grope in vain."

1297,OUT OF THE EAST,In generations reaped; and near and near
1298,OUT OF THE EAST,Age leads on Death--I hear his husky sigh.

1313,OUT OF THE EAST,Down the steep valley from the barren hill
1314,OUT OF THE EAST,A herd of deer with antlered leader made
1315,OUT OF THE EAST,Brief apparition. Mist brimmed up until
1316,OUT OF THE EAST,Only the great round heights yet solid stayed--
1317,OUT OF THE EAST,"Then they too changed to spectral, and upon"

1320,OUT OF THE EAST,"""Standing to-day your father's grave beside,"

1324,OUT OF THE EAST,Save for the body of a prince that died
1325,OUT OF THE EAST,"As princes die; there was none whispered, 'Where"

1333,OUT OF THE EAST,"As though the gods of men when Time began,"
1334,OUT OF THE EAST,"Fathers of fathers of old humankind,"
1335,OUT OF THE EAST,"Startled, heard now the changeful future knock;"
1336,OUT OF THE EAST,And their lament it was from rock to rock

1338,OUT OF THE EAST,"""Tossed with the wind's long echo ... O, speak not,"
1339,OUT OF THE EAST,"Nor tell me with my loss I am so dazed,"
1340,OUT OF THE EAST,That my tongue speaks unfaithfully my thought;
1341,OUT OF THE EAST,"That you, you too, within his shadow raised,"
1342,OUT OF THE EAST,"Stand bare now, wanting all you held or thought,"
1343,OUT OF THE EAST,By aimless love or prisoned grief amazed.
1344,OUT OF THE EAST,"Tell me not: let me out of silence speak,"
1345,OUT OF THE EAST,"Or let me still my thoughts in silence break."""
1346,OUT OF THE EAST,
1347,OUT OF THE EAST,"And so both stood, and not a word to say,"
1348,OUT OF THE EAST,"By silence overborne, until at last"
1349,OUT OF THE EAST,"The young man breathed, ""Look how the end of day"
1350,OUT OF THE EAST,"Falls heavily, as though the earth were cast"
1351,OUT OF THE EAST,"Into a shapeless soundless pit, where ray"
1352,OUT OF THE EAST,Of heavenly light never the verge has past.
1353,OUT OF THE EAST,"Yet will the late moon's light anon shine here,"
1354,OUT OF THE EAST,"And then gray light, and then the sun's light clear."
1355,OUT OF THE EAST,
1356,OUT OF THE EAST,"""Sire, 'twas my father died, and like night's pit"
1357,OUT OF THE EAST,Soundless and shapeless yawn my orphaned years.
1358,OUT OF THE EAST,And yet I know morn comes and brings with it
1359,OUT OF THE EAST,"Old tasks again, and new joys, hopes and fears."
1360,OUT OF THE EAST,"Or sword or plough these fingers will find fit,"
1361,OUT OF THE EAST,"And morrows end with other cries and tears,"
1362,OUT OF THE EAST,With women's arms and children's voices and

1365,OUT OF THE EAST,"""But look, upon your beard the dew is bright,"
1366,OUT OF THE EAST,"Chill is the winter fall: let us go in."""
1367,OUT OF THE EAST,Then moved they slowly downward till a light
1368,OUT OF THE EAST,Shining the door-post and thonged door between
1369,OUT OF THE EAST,Showed the square Prince's House. Out of the night
1370,OUT OF THE EAST,They passed the sudden rubied warmth within.
1371,OUT OF THE EAST,Curled shadowy by the wall a servant slept:
1372,OUT OF THE EAST,A sleepy hound from the same corner crept.
1373,OUT OF THE EAST,
1374,OUT OF THE EAST,Soon were they couched. The young man fell asleep;
1375,OUT OF THE EAST,"While the old Prince drowsing uneasily,"
1376,OUT OF THE EAST,"Tossing on the crest of agitations deep,"
1377,OUT OF THE EAST,"Dreamed waking, waking dreamed. Then memory"
1378,OUT OF THE EAST,"The unseen hound, did from her corner creep"
1379,OUT OF THE EAST,Into his bosom and stirred him with her sigh
1380,OUT OF THE EAST,Soundless. And he arose and answering pressed
1381,OUT OF THE EAST,Her beloved head yet closer to his breast....
1382,OUT OF THE EAST,
1383,OUT OF THE EAST,Happy those years returned when first he strode
1384,OUT OF THE EAST,"Beside his father's knees, or climbed and felt"
1385,OUT OF THE EAST,"The warm strength of those arms, or singing rode"
1386,OUT OF THE EAST,High on his shoulders; or in winter pelt
1387,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of dread beasts wrapt, set as his father showed"
1388,OUT OF THE EAST,"Snares in the frosty grass, and at dawn knelt"
1389,OUT OF THE EAST,"Beside the snares, and shouting homeward tore,"
1390,OUT OF THE EAST,Winged with such pride as seldom manhood wore.
1391,OUT OF THE EAST,
1392,OUT OF THE EAST,"--How many, many, many years ago!"
1393,OUT OF THE EAST,There was no older man now walked the earth.
1394,OUT OF THE EAST,"Had all those years sunk to a bitter glow,"
1395,OUT OF THE EAST,Like the fire lingering yet upon the hearth?
1396,OUT OF THE EAST,"Ah, he might warm his hands there still, and so"
1397,OUT OF THE EAST,"Must warm his heart now in this wintry dearth,"
1398,OUT OF THE EAST,Till the reluming sunken fire should give
1399,OUT OF THE EAST,Warmth to his ageing wits and bid him live.
1400,OUT OF THE EAST,
1401,OUT OF THE EAST,Even this house! It was his father told
1402,OUT OF THE EAST,How in the days half lost in icy time
1403,OUT OF THE EAST,Men first forsook their wormy caves and cold
1404,OUT OF THE EAST,To build where the wind-footed cattle climb;
1405,OUT OF THE EAST,And noise of labour broke the silence old
1406,OUT OF THE EAST,By such unbroken since the sparkling prime
1407,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of the world's spring. And so the house arose,"
1408,OUT OF THE EAST,"A builded cave, perpetual as the snows"
1409,OUT OF THE EAST,
1410,OUT OF THE EAST,On the remotest summits of the range
1411,OUT OF THE EAST,Hemming the north. Then house by house appeared
1412,OUT OF THE EAST,"'Neath valley-eaves, and change following on change"
1413,OUT OF THE EAST,Unnoted tamed earth's shaggy front. Men heard
1414,OUT OF THE EAST,"Strange voices syllabling with accents strange,"
1415,OUT OF THE EAST,"By travellers breathed who, startled, paused and feared"
1416,OUT OF THE EAST,Seeing the smoke of habitations curled
1417,OUT OF THE EAST,Above this hollow of an unrumoured world.
1418,OUT OF THE EAST,
1419,OUT OF THE EAST,"Startled, they paused and spoke by doubtful sign,"
1420,OUT OF THE EAST,"Answered by hesitating sign, until"
1421,OUT OF THE EAST,"Moved one with aspect fearless and benign,"
1422,OUT OF THE EAST,"And met one fearless, while all else hung still."
1423,OUT OF THE EAST,"And then was welcome, rest, and meat and wine"
1424,OUT OF THE EAST,"And intercourse of uncouth word, as shrill"
1425,OUT OF THE EAST,Voice with deep voice was mingled. So they stayed
1426,OUT OF THE EAST,And to astonished eyes strange arts betrayed.
1427,OUT OF THE EAST,
1428,OUT OF THE EAST,"By them the oarage of the wind was taught,"
1429,OUT OF THE EAST,And how the quick tail steered the cockled boat.
1430,OUT OF THE EAST,"They netted fruitful streams, and smiling brought"
1431,OUT OF THE EAST,"Their breaking wickers home, too full to float."
1432,OUT OF THE EAST,And opening the earth's rich womb they wrought
1433,OUT OF THE EAST,Arms from the sullied ore; and labouring smote
1434,OUT OF THE EAST,"The mountain's bosom, till a path was seen"
1435,OUT OF THE EAST,Stony amid the flushed snow and flushed green.
1436,OUT OF THE EAST,
1437,OUT OF THE EAST,Then first upon earth's wave the silver share
1438,OUT OF THE EAST,"Floated, by the teamed oxen drawn; then first"
1439,OUT OF THE EAST,"Were seed-time rites, and harvest rites when bare"
1440,OUT OF THE EAST,"The cropped fields lay, and gathered tumult--nurst"
1441,OUT OF THE EAST,Long in the breasts of men that laboured there--
1442,OUT OF THE EAST,Now in the broad ease of fulfilment burst;
1443,OUT OF THE EAST,"And when the winter tasks failed in days chill,"
1444,OUT OF THE EAST,"Weaving of bright-hued yarn, and chattering shrill;"
1445,OUT OF THE EAST,
1446,OUT OF THE EAST,And the loved tones of music sounded sweet
1447,OUT OF THE EAST,"Unwonted, when the new-stopped pipe was heard"
1448,OUT OF THE EAST,"Rising and falling, and the falling feet"
1449,OUT OF THE EAST,Of sudden dancers. And old men were stirred
1450,OUT OF THE EAST,With old men's memories of ancient heat
1451,OUT OF THE EAST,When youth sang in their bosoms like a bird....
1452,OUT OF THE EAST,"Sweet that divine musician, Memory,"
1453,OUT OF THE EAST,Fingering her many-reeded melody.
1454,OUT OF THE EAST,
1455,OUT OF THE EAST,Then as he stared into the wasting glow
1456,OUT OF THE EAST,"And watched the fire faint in the whitening wood,"
1457,OUT OF THE EAST,"Came starker shadows moving vast and slow,"
1458,OUT OF THE EAST,"And echoes of wild strife and smell of blood,"
1459,OUT OF THE EAST,"Twitching of slain men, cries of parting woe,"
1460,OUT OF THE EAST,Bruised bodies ghastly in the mountain flood;
1461,OUT OF THE EAST,"Burials and burnings, triumph with terrors blent,"
1462,OUT OF THE EAST,And widowed languors and night-long lament.
1463,OUT OF THE EAST,
1464,OUT OF THE EAST,"Like seeds long buried, these dead memories"
1465,OUT OF THE EAST,Upthrust in their new green and spread to flower:
1466,OUT OF THE EAST,An eager child against his father's knees
1467,OUT OF THE EAST,"Leaning, he had listened many an evening hour."
1468,OUT OF THE EAST,Now these remote reworded histories
1469,OUT OF THE EAST,"Entangled with his own renewed their power,"
1470,OUT OF THE EAST,"Breathing an antique virtue through his mind,"
1471,OUT OF THE EAST,As through dense yew boughs breathes the undying wind.
1472,OUT OF THE EAST,
1473,OUT OF THE EAST,"Sighing, he rose up softly. On the wall"
1474,OUT OF THE EAST,A dark shape shambled aimless to and fro;
1475,OUT OF THE EAST,"Head bent, eyes inward-seeing, rugged, tall,"
1476,OUT OF THE EAST,Himself a shadow moved with musings slow
1477,OUT OF THE EAST,"Amid his cumbered past, and heard sweet call"
1478,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of mother voice, and mother folk, and flow"
1479,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of gentle and proud speech and tender laughter,"
1480,OUT OF THE EAST,"Story and song, fault and forgiveness after;"
1481,OUT OF THE EAST,
1482,OUT OF THE EAST,"And a voice graver, gentler than a man"
1483,OUT OF THE EAST,"Might hear from any but a woman beloved,"
1484,OUT OF THE EAST,Stilling and awakening the blood that ran
1485,OUT OF THE EAST,"Like ocean tide, as neared she or removed ..."
1486,OUT OF THE EAST,Faded that music. Then a voice began
1487,OUT OF THE EAST,"Paining within his heart, yet unreproved;"
1488,OUT OF THE EAST,For dear the anguish is that steals upon
1489,OUT OF THE EAST,A father's spirit lamenting his lost son.
1490,OUT OF THE EAST,
1491,OUT OF THE EAST,--The latest born and latest lost of those
1492,OUT OF THE EAST,Of his strong and her gentle being born.
1493,OUT OF THE EAST,"By earthquake, pestilence, by human foes"
1494,OUT OF THE EAST,Long were they dead; and yet not all forlorn
1495,OUT OF THE EAST,"He grieved, for at his side the youngest rose"
1496,OUT OF THE EAST,Bright as a willow gilded by dewy morn....
1497,OUT OF THE EAST,"Felled now the tree, silent that music, still"
1498,OUT OF THE EAST,The motion that did all the vale-air fill.
1499,OUT OF THE EAST,
1500,OUT OF THE EAST,Once more they bore the body from the hunt
1501,OUT OF THE EAST,Where he alone had died. Once more he heard
1502,OUT OF THE EAST,"The wail and sigh, and saw once more their front"
1503,OUT OF THE EAST,Of drooping grief; once more the wailing stirred
1504,OUT OF THE EAST,Old hounds to baying wilder than was wont;
1505,OUT OF THE EAST,"Fell once more like slow, sullen rain each word"
1506,OUT OF THE EAST,"Reluctant, telling to his senses strayed,"
1507,OUT OF THE EAST,How while the gods drowsed and men hung afraid.
1508,OUT OF THE EAST,
1509,OUT OF THE EAST,Slain was the Prince unwary by the paw
1510,OUT OF THE EAST,Of a springing beast that died in giving death.
1511,OUT OF THE EAST,"Again the featureless torn face he saw,"
1512,OUT OF THE EAST,The ribboned bosom emptied of warm breath;
1513,OUT OF THE EAST,"Again the circle sudden hush'd with awe,"
1514,OUT OF THE EAST,And smothered moaning heard the hush beneath.
1515,OUT OF THE EAST,"Again, again, and every night again,"
1516,OUT OF THE EAST,Vision renewed and voice recalled in vain.
1517,OUT OF THE EAST,
1518,OUT OF THE EAST,Again those dear and lamentable rites
1519,OUT OF THE EAST,"Within the winter stems of forest shade,"
1520,OUT OF THE EAST,"The pile, the smokeless flame, the thousand lights,"
1521,OUT OF THE EAST,The one light that in all the thousand played;
1522,OUT OF THE EAST,"Deep burthened voices while, around the heights"
1523,OUT OF THE EAST,"Lifting, young trebles their wild echo made;"
1524,OUT OF THE EAST,Then the returning torches at the pyre
1525,OUT OF THE EAST,"Lit, when the eye glowed faint within the fire."
1526,OUT OF THE EAST,
1527,OUT OF THE EAST,*       *       *       *       *
1528,OUT OF THE EAST,
1529,OUT OF THE EAST,Even as a man that by slow steps may climb
1530,OUT OF THE EAST,An unknown mountain path with tired tread
1531,OUT OF THE EAST,"By ice-fringed brook and close herb white with rime,"
1532,OUT OF THE EAST,Sees sudden far below a strange land spread
1533,OUT OF THE EAST,Immense; so from his lonely crag of Time
1534,OUT OF THE EAST,"The Prince, his eye bewildered and adread,"
1535,OUT OF THE EAST,"Gazed at the vast, with mist and storm confused,"
1536,OUT OF THE EAST,"Cloud-racked, and changing even while he mused."
1537,OUT OF THE EAST,
1538,OUT OF THE EAST,Ending were the old wise and stable ways.
1539,OUT OF THE EAST,"Adventurers into distant lands had fared,"
1540,OUT OF THE EAST,From distant lands adventurers with gaze
1541,OUT OF THE EAST,"Proud and unenvying on his kingdom stared,"
1542,OUT OF THE EAST,And sojourning had shaken quiet days
1543,OUT OF THE EAST,"With restless knowledge, and strange worship reared"
1544,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of foreign altars, idols, prayers and songs"
1545,OUT OF THE EAST,And sacrifice as to such gods belongs.
1546,OUT OF THE EAST,
1547,OUT OF THE EAST,And all unsatisfied his people grown
1548,OUT OF THE EAST,Would move from this rejected mountain range
1549,OUT OF THE EAST,"By yearlong valley journeys slowly down,"
1550,OUT OF THE EAST,"Sun-following, till surfeited with change,"
1551,OUT OF THE EAST,"Mid idle pastures pitched or fabled town,"
1552,OUT OF THE EAST,"Subdued to climes and kings and customs strange,"
1553,OUT OF THE EAST,At length their very name should die away
1554,OUT OF THE EAST,"And all their remnant be a vague ""Men say."""
1555,OUT OF THE EAST,
1556,OUT OF THE EAST,"""Men say!"" he sighed, and from that lofty verge"
1557,OUT OF THE EAST,Of inward seeing drooped his doubtful sight.
1558,OUT OF THE EAST,Sweet was it from such reverie to emerge
1559,OUT OF THE EAST,"And breathe once more the thoughtless air of night,"
1560,OUT OF THE EAST,And watch the fire-slave through fresh billets urge
1561,OUT OF THE EAST,"The sleeping flame, until the vivid light"
1562,OUT OF THE EAST,And toothed shadows wearied.... And then crept
1563,OUT OF THE EAST,"The hounds a little nearer, and all slept."
1564,OUT OF THE EAST,
1565,OUT OF THE EAST,*       *       *       *       *
1566,OUT OF THE EAST,
1567,OUT OF THE EAST,"But the young man still lay in quiet sleep,"
1568,OUT OF THE EAST,"Or half-sleep, and a dream-born cloud enwreathed"
1569,OUT OF THE EAST,"With memories, hopes and longings hidden deep"
1570,OUT OF THE EAST,"In his flown mind. Another air he breathed,"
1571,OUT OF THE EAST,Saw from an unsubstantial mountain sweep
1572,OUT OF THE EAST,"In purest light, soon in low shadow sheathed,"
1573,OUT OF THE EAST,"Semblance of faint-known faces, or beloved"
1574,OUT OF THE EAST,"Daily-acquainted still, or long removed."
1575,OUT OF THE EAST,
1576,OUT OF THE EAST,Even as sacred fire in fennel stalks
1577,OUT OF THE EAST,"Through windy ways is borne and densest night,"
1578,OUT OF THE EAST,Till where the outpost shivering sentry walks
1579,OUT OF THE EAST,"Beating the minutes into hours, the light"
1580,OUT OF THE EAST,"Touches the guarded pile and, flaring, balks"
1581,OUT OF THE EAST,Beasts padding near and each unvisioned sprite
1582,OUT OF THE EAST,By old dread apprehended; and new gladness
1583,OUT OF THE EAST,Shakes in the village prone in winter sadness:--
1584,OUT OF THE EAST,
1585,OUT OF THE EAST,So through the young man's dream the kingly flame
1586,OUT OF THE EAST,In his own breast was undiminished borne.
1587,OUT OF THE EAST,And other peoples catching from his fame
1588,OUT OF THE EAST,"A noble heat, in neighbouring lands forlorn,"
1589,OUT OF THE EAST,Would glow with new power and the ancient name
1590,OUT OF THE EAST,"Bless, that had brightened through their narrow morn."
1591,OUT OF THE EAST,And purer yet and steadier would pass on
1592,OUT OF THE EAST,The sacred flame to son and son and son.
1593,OUT OF THE EAST,
1594,OUT OF THE EAST,Or with contracting mind he saw the host
1595,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of mountain warriors banded, moving down"
1596,OUT OF THE EAST,"Untrodden ways, as on young buds a frost"
1597,OUT OF THE EAST,"Falls, and the spring lies stiff. The air was sown"
1598,OUT OF THE EAST,"With strife, the fields with blood, the night with ghost"
1599,OUT OF THE EAST,"Wandering by ghost, and wounded men were strown"
1600,OUT OF THE EAST,"Surprised, unweaponed; and chill air congealed"
1601,OUT OF THE EAST,"Each hurt, and with the blood their breath was sealed."
1602,OUT OF THE EAST,
1603,OUT OF THE EAST,And the loved tones of music sounded fierce
1604,OUT OF THE EAST,When the returning files with aspect proud
1605,OUT OF THE EAST,"Approached, and brandished their rich trophied spears."
1606,OUT OF THE EAST,"Sweet the pipes' spearlike music, sweet and loud,"
1607,OUT OF THE EAST,And music of smitten arms was sweet to tears;
1608,OUT OF THE EAST,"Sweet the dance unto smiling gods new vowed,"
1609,OUT OF THE EAST,"Sweet the recounting song and choral cries,"
1610,OUT OF THE EAST,And age's quaverings and girls' envious sighs.
1611,OUT OF THE EAST,
1612,OUT OF THE EAST,"--So of himself, a father-king, he dreamed,"
1613,OUT OF THE EAST,Holding an equal nation in his eye.
1614,OUT OF THE EAST,O with what golden points the future gleamed!
1615,OUT OF THE EAST,"Rustled the years like laden mule-trains by,"
1616,OUT OF THE EAST,Each with its burthen of old time redeemed....
1617,OUT OF THE EAST,"Splendour on splendour poured, and so would lie"
1618,OUT OF THE EAST,"Unnoted and unmeasured:--metals, herds,"
1619,OUT OF THE EAST,"Distant-sought wonders, strange growths, beasts and birds."
1620,OUT OF THE EAST,
1621,OUT OF THE EAST,Within the summer of that splendid shade
1622,OUT OF THE EAST,"Might men live happy and nought left to fear,"
1623,OUT OF THE EAST,Or if an antique restless spirit played
1624,OUT OF THE EAST,"Fretful within their bones, and change drew near"
1625,OUT OF THE EAST,"Drumming wild airs, and another music made,"
1626,OUT OF THE EAST,"A father-king, speaking assured and clear,"
1627,OUT OF THE EAST,Bidding them follow he would lead them forth
1628,OUT OF THE EAST,Through the yet undiscovered frowning north.
1629,OUT OF THE EAST,
1630,OUT OF THE EAST,"And the last fire on the warm stones would burn,"
1631,OUT OF THE EAST,And the smoke linger on the mountain skies.
1632,OUT OF THE EAST,"And seeing, they would muse yet of return"
1633,OUT OF THE EAST,And then forget their sadness in the cries
1634,OUT OF THE EAST,Confused of the great caravan; and so turn
1635,OUT OF THE EAST,Towards the next sun-setting and the next sunrise
1636,OUT OF THE EAST,Many and many a day and wind and wind
1637,OUT OF THE EAST,"Through foreign earth, as a dream through the mind."
1638,OUT OF THE EAST,
1639,OUT OF THE EAST,Flowing on with the changes of its thought.
1640,OUT OF THE EAST,And doubtful kings entreating them to stay
1641,OUT OF THE EAST,Would sleep the easier when they lingered not;
1642,OUT OF THE EAST,"And sullen tribes menacing would make way,"
1643,OUT OF THE EAST,"And broad slow rivers in their tide be caught,"
1644,OUT OF THE EAST,And the long caravan o'er the ford all day
1645,OUT OF THE EAST,And all day and all day pass; while the tide slept
1646,OUT OF THE EAST,"In sluggish shallows, or through marsh-reeds crept."
1647,OUT OF THE EAST,
1648,OUT OF THE EAST,"So would they on and on, with death and birth"
1649,OUT OF THE EAST,"For wayfellows and nightly stars for guide,"
1650,OUT OF THE EAST,"While seasons bloomed and faded on the earth,"
1651,OUT OF THE EAST,And jealous gods their wandering gods would chide.
1652,OUT OF THE EAST,"Until, weary of endless going forth"
1653,OUT OF THE EAST,"Dark-locust-like, the old fret would subside,"
1654,OUT OF THE EAST,"And young men with aged men and women cry,"
1655,OUT OF THE EAST,"""In this full-rivered pasture let us lie!"
1656,OUT OF THE EAST,
1657,OUT OF THE EAST,"""Here let us lie, and wanderings be at rest!"""
1658,OUT OF THE EAST,Midmost a cedar grove high sacrifice
1659,OUT OF THE EAST,"Needs then be made, that gods be manifest;"
1660,OUT OF THE EAST,"And while the smoke spread in long twilit skies,"
1661,OUT OF THE EAST,"""Here let us lie, and wanderings be at rest,"""
1662,OUT OF THE EAST,Would old men breathe repeated between sighs.
1663,OUT OF THE EAST,"""In this green world and cool,"" would mothers say,"
1664,OUT OF THE EAST,"""Rest we, nor with thin babes yet longer stray."""
1665,OUT OF THE EAST,
1666,OUT OF THE EAST,--So stealing from the mind of the old King
1667,OUT OF THE EAST,"Exhausted, into the sleeping young man's brain"
1668,OUT OF THE EAST,Crept the same dream and lifted on new wing
1669,OUT OF THE EAST,"And took from his swift passions a new stain,"
1670,OUT OF THE EAST,"Sanguine and azure, and first fluttering"
1671,OUT OF THE EAST,Rose then on easy vans that bore again
1672,OUT OF THE EAST,The sleeper past his common thought's confine:--
1673,OUT OF THE EAST,"So borne, so soaring, in that air divine,"
1674,OUT OF THE EAST,
1675,OUT OF THE EAST,"He saw his people stayed, their journeys ended...."
1676,OUT OF THE EAST,"There should they, no more fretful, dwell for ever"
1677,OUT OF THE EAST,In the full-nourished pasture where untended
1678,OUT OF THE EAST,"Herds multiplied, and famine threatened never,"
1679,OUT OF THE EAST,And where high border-hills glittered with splendid
1680,OUT OF THE EAST,Sparse-covered veins washed by the hill-born river.
1681,OUT OF THE EAST,"So stead by stead arose, and men there moved"
1682,OUT OF THE EAST,"Satisfied, and no more vain longings roved."
1683,OUT OF THE EAST,
1684,OUT OF THE EAST,"Again the silver plough gleamed in the sod,"
1685,OUT OF THE EAST,And seed from old fields slept in furrows new.
1686,OUT OF THE EAST,Then when Spring's rain and sun together trod
1687,OUT OF THE EAST,"And interweaved swift steps the meadow through,"
1688,OUT OF THE EAST,Old rites revived; they bore the shapen god
1689,OUT OF THE EAST,"With green stalks and first-budded boughs, and drew"
1690,OUT OF THE EAST,Together youth and age. And sowers leapt
1691,OUT OF THE EAST,High o'er the seed in earth's cold bosom wrapt:--
1692,OUT OF THE EAST,
1693,OUT OF THE EAST,So in the golden-hued and burning hours
1694,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of harvest, leapt on high the full-eared corn."
1695,OUT OF THE EAST,Friendly to pious hands those imaged Powers
1696,OUT OF THE EAST,Of rain and sun. And when the grain was borne
1697,OUT OF THE EAST,"By oxen trailing tangled straws and flowers,"
1698,OUT OF THE EAST,"With leaves and dying blossoms on each horn,"
1699,OUT OF THE EAST,Friendly the gods commingling in the shades
1700,OUT OF THE EAST,Of moon and torch and smoke-delaying glades.
1701,OUT OF THE EAST,
1702,OUT OF THE EAST,Fell slowly sunset; the starred evening cool
1703,OUT OF THE EAST,"Drooped round as mid his people the king rode,"
1704,OUT OF THE EAST,"Blessing and blessed, and in the faithful pool"
1705,OUT OF THE EAST,Of their old loves his clear reflection glowed
1706,OUT OF THE EAST,"Like summer's golden moon:--in wise and fool,"
1707,OUT OF THE EAST,"Noble and mean, accustomed reverence showed"
1708,OUT OF THE EAST,Clear-shining; so he reached the unbarred hall
1709,OUT OF THE EAST,"Where lamps, lords, servitors flashed festival,"
1710,OUT OF THE EAST,
1711,OUT OF THE EAST,Remembering old journeys and their end.
1712,OUT OF THE EAST,"Bright-throned he sat there, with those lords around"
1713,OUT OF THE EAST,"Snow-polled, co-eval, as with friends their friend"
1714,OUT OF THE EAST,Feasting. Arose at length the awaited sound
1715,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of bardic chanting, bidding their thoughts descend"
1716,OUT OF THE EAST,"Into the chamber where the Past lay bound,"
1717,OUT OF THE EAST,"Wanting but music's finger; so upspringing,"
1718,OUT OF THE EAST,The Past stormed all their minds in that loud singing.
1719,OUT OF THE EAST,
1720,OUT OF THE EAST,"And strangers, furred and tawny, seated there,"
1721,OUT OF THE EAST,"Far travellers from the sunrise, looking on"
1722,OUT OF THE EAST,"The feasting and the splendour, and with ear"
1723,OUT OF THE EAST,Uncertain listening to the solemn tone
1724,OUT OF THE EAST,"Of most dear Memory, envied all and sware"
1725,OUT OF THE EAST,A sudden fealty. But the bard sang on
1726,OUT OF THE EAST,While silver beakers brimmed untouched; and darkened
1727,OUT OF THE EAST,The proud remembering eyes of men that hearkened.
1728,OUT OF THE EAST,
1729,OUT OF THE EAST,Then came once more those strangers leading long
1730,OUT OF THE EAST,Migration of their subject folk. They stayed
1731,OUT OF THE EAST,"And medley'd and were mingled, and their throng"
1732,OUT OF THE EAST,"Melted in his like snows, and so were made"
1733,OUT OF THE EAST,"One with them, and forgot their useless tongue,"
1734,OUT OF THE EAST,Nor now their ancient bloody worship paid
1735,OUT OF THE EAST,"To painted gods:--name, language, story died"
1736,OUT OF THE EAST,When their last faithless exile parting sighed.
1737,OUT OF THE EAST,
1738,OUT OF THE EAST,"So year on year, century on century"
1739,OUT OF THE EAST,In his imagination of delight
1740,OUT OF THE EAST,"Followed, in a new world all innocency"
1741,OUT OF THE EAST,"And simpleness, and made for beings bright,"
1742,OUT OF THE EAST,"Where man to man was friend, unfearful, free,"
1743,OUT OF THE EAST,"And natural griefs alone darkened their night,"
1744,OUT OF THE EAST,"And natural joys as the wide air were common,"
1745,OUT OF THE EAST,And kindness was the bond of all kin human.
1746,OUT OF THE EAST,
1747,OUT OF THE EAST,*       *       *       *       *
1748,OUT OF THE EAST,
1749,OUT OF THE EAST,--When the loved reeds of music sounded clear
1750,OUT OF THE EAST,From birds' breasts quivering in tall woodland trees
1751,OUT OF THE EAST,"That rustled leafless in the winter air,"
1752,OUT OF THE EAST,And with morn's new voice shrilled the western breeze:
1753,OUT OF THE EAST,Folding her wings the dream crept from his ear
1754,OUT OF THE EAST,To hang where bats drowse until daylight dies.
1755,OUT OF THE EAST,Then he from sleep's dear vanity awaking
1756,OUT OF THE EAST,Watched a sole sunbeam the roof-shadows raking.
1757,OUT OF THE EAST,
1758,OUT OF THE EAST,
1759,OUT OF THE EAST,
1760,OUT OF THE EAST,

1769,THE WAKERS,The joyous morning ran and kissed the grass
1770,THE WAKERS,"And drew his fingers through her sleeping hair,"
1771,THE WAKERS,"And cried, ""Before thy flowers are well awake"
1772,THE WAKERS,"Rise, and the lingering darkness from thee shake."

1792,THE WAKERS,Her dews for happiness to hear morning call....

1847,THE FIRST HOUSE,
1848,THE FIRST HOUSE,
1849,THE FIRST HOUSE,That is the earliest thing that I remember--
1850,THE FIRST HOUSE,"The narrow house in the long narrow street,"
1851,THE FIRST HOUSE,Dark rooms within and darkness out of doors
1852,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Where grasses in the garden lift in the wind,"
1853,THE FIRST HOUSE,Long grasses clinging round unsteady feet.
1854,THE FIRST HOUSE,"The sunlight through one narrow passage pours,"
1855,THE FIRST HOUSE,"As through the keyhole into a dusty room,"
1856,THE FIRST HOUSE,Striking with a golden rod the greening gloom.
1857,THE FIRST HOUSE,"The tall, tall timber-stacks have yet been kind,"
1858,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Letting the sun fling his rod clear between,"
1859,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Lest there should be no gold upon the green,"
1860,THE FIRST HOUSE,"And no light then for a child to dream upon,"
1861,THE FIRST HOUSE,And day be of day's brightness all forlorn.
1862,THE FIRST HOUSE,"I saw those timber piles first dark and tall,"
1863,THE FIRST HOUSE,"And then men clambered up, and stumbled down,"
1864,THE FIRST HOUSE,Each with a heavy and long timber borne
1865,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Upon broad shoulders, leather-covered, bent."
1866,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Hour after hour, day after day they went,"
1867,THE FIRST HOUSE,Until the piles were gone and a new sky
1868,THE FIRST HOUSE,Stretched high and white above the garden wall.
1869,THE FIRST HOUSE,"And then fresh piles crept slowly up and up,"
1870,THE FIRST HOUSE,"The strong men staggering, more cruelly bowed,"
1871,THE FIRST HOUSE,Till at last they lay idle on the top
1872,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Looking down from their height on things so small,"
1873,THE FIRST HOUSE,While I looked wondering and fearful up
1874,THE FIRST HOUSE,At the strong men at rest on the new-built cloud.
1875,THE FIRST HOUSE,But there was other gold than the sun's sparse gold--
1876,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Florence's hair, its brightness lying still"
1877,THE FIRST HOUSE,Upon my mind as then upon the grass.
1878,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Now the grass covers it and I am old,"
1879,THE FIRST HOUSE,"Remembering but her hair and that long grass,"
1880,THE FIRST HOUSE,And the great wood-stacks threatening to fall--
1881,THE FIRST HOUSE,When all dark things will.

1892,THE OTHER HOUSE,And a bewildering garden all of light and heat.
1893,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1894,THE OTHER HOUSE,"Only that red floor and garden now remain,"
1895,THE OTHER HOUSE,"One glowing firelike in my glowing brain,"
1896,THE OTHER HOUSE,"One with smell, colour, sun and cloud revived again."
1897,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1898,THE OTHER HOUSE,"Yet in the garden the sky was very small,"
1899,THE OTHER HOUSE,Closed by some darkness beyond the low brown wall;
1900,THE OTHER HOUSE,But from the west the gold could long unhindered fall.
1901,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1902,THE OTHER HOUSE,Of human faces I remember none
1903,THE OTHER HOUSE,Amid the garden; but myself alone
1904,THE OTHER HOUSE,"With creeping-jenny, sunflower, marigold, snapdragon--"
1905,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1906,THE OTHER HOUSE,"These all my love, these now all my light,"

1908,THE OTHER HOUSE,The sun brushed all their brightness with his skirt more bright.
1909,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1910,THE OTHER HOUSE,"And I was happy when I knew it not,"
1911,THE OTHER HOUSE,"Dreaming of nothing more than that small plot,"
1912,THE OTHER HOUSE,And the high sky and sun that floated bright and hot.
1913,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1914,THE OTHER HOUSE,"But what night was, save dark, I did not know."
1915,THE OTHER HOUSE,The blind shut out the stars: the moon would go
1916,THE OTHER HOUSE,"Staring, unstared at, moon and stars unnoted flow."
1917,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1918,THE OTHER HOUSE,"Until one night, into the strange street led,"
1919,THE OTHER HOUSE,"To stare at a strange light from the Factory shed,"
1920,THE OTHER HOUSE,"Wheeling and darting, withdrawn, and sudden again outsped--"
1921,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1922,THE OTHER HOUSE,"No one knew why--but I knew darkness then,"
1923,THE OTHER HOUSE,And saw the stars that hung so still; but when
1924,THE OTHER HOUSE,I lay abed the old starless dark came back again.
1925,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1926,THE OTHER HOUSE,Night is not night without the stars and moon.
1927,THE OTHER HOUSE,"I knew them not, or I forgot too soon,"
1928,THE OTHER HOUSE,"And now remember only the glowing sun of noon,"
1929,THE OTHER HOUSE,
1930,THE OTHER HOUSE,"The red floor, and yellow flowers, and a lonely child,"
1931,THE OTHER HOUSE,"And a whistle morn and noon and evening shrilled,"
1932,THE OTHER HOUSE,And darkness when the household murmurs even were stilled.

1940,THE FIRE,
1941,THE FIRE,"Near the house flowed, or paused, the black Canal,"
1942,THE FIRE,Edged by the timber piles so black and tall.
1943,THE FIRE,From the rotten fence I watched the horses pull
1944,THE FIRE,"Along the footpath, slow and beautiful,"
1945,THE FIRE,"Moving with strength and ease, in their great size"
1946,THE FIRE,And untired movement wonderful to my eyes;
1947,THE FIRE,Their dull brass clanking as each shaggy foot
1948,THE FIRE,Stamped the soft cinder track as fine as soot.
1949,THE FIRE,"The driver lurched old and forbidding by,"
1950,THE FIRE,Not seeing the child that feared to meet his eye.
1951,THE FIRE,"I watched the rope dip, tighten, and the water flash"
1952,THE FIRE,"In falling, and then heard the hiss and splash;"
1953,THE FIRE,"I watched the barge drag slowly on and on,"
1954,THE FIRE,"Not dreaming how lovely a ship could ride the water upon,"
1955,THE FIRE,"Not dreaming how lovely flowing water was,"
1956,THE FIRE,"Sung to by trees and fingered by long grass,"
1957,THE FIRE,Or running from the bosom of a hill
1958,THE FIRE,"Down, where it flows so deep that it seems still."
1959,THE FIRE,But it was by that rotten fence one night
1960,THE FIRE,"I saw the timber piles break into light,"
1961,THE FIRE,Suddenly leaping into a heavenly flame
1962,THE FIRE,That played with the wind and one with the wind became.
1963,THE FIRE,"Pile to pile gave its fire, till they were like"
1964,THE FIRE,"Bright angels with flashing swords before they strike,"
1965,THE FIRE,"Terrible and lovely. But men those angels fought,"
1966,THE FIRE,"Small and humble and patient all night wrought,"
1967,THE FIRE,"And all day wrought and night and day again,"
1968,THE FIRE,"And night and day, pouring their hissing rain,"
1969,THE FIRE,Until the angels tired and one by one died.
1970,THE FIRE,"Then their black spectres haunted the waterside,"
1971,THE FIRE,"Charred ruins, broken-limbed, no more erect,"
1972,THE FIRE,"Or heaped black dust, with cold white ashes flecked."
1973,THE FIRE,"But I had seen the angel-quelling men,"
1974,THE FIRE,"With blackened and bruised face, the horses thin,"
1975,THE FIRE,"The glittering harness, the leaky, bubbling mains,"
1976,THE FIRE,"The broad smoke, and the steam from the leaping rains:--"
1977,THE FIRE,"O I had seen what I should not forget,"
1978,THE FIRE,Men that defeated ruinous angels and shall still defeat.

1988,THE KITE,"All blue and lifting white,"

1990,THE KITE,To fly his kite.
1991,THE KITE,
1992,THE KITE,"The fields were aged, bare,"
1993,THE KITE,Shut between houses everywhere.
1994,THE KITE,All the way there
1995,THE KITE,The wind tugged at the kite to take it
1996,THE KITE,"Untethered, toss and break it;"
1997,THE KITE,"But Frank held fast, and I"
1998,THE KITE,Walked with him admiringly;
1999,THE KITE,In his light brave and fine
2000,THE KITE,How bright was mine!
2001,THE KITE,
2002,THE KITE,We tailed the kite

2006,THE KITE,"Was scarcely higher, and not so bright."
2007,THE KITE,"""Let go!"" he cried, and I let go"
2008,THE KITE,And watched the kite
2009,THE KITE,Swaying and rising so
2010,THE KITE,"That I was rooted to the place,"
2011,THE KITE,Watching the kite
2012,THE KITE,"Rise into the blue,"
2013,THE KITE,Lifting its head against the white
2014,THE KITE,"Against the sun,"
2015,THE KITE,Against the height
2016,THE KITE,"That far-off, farther drew;"
2017,THE KITE,Shivering there

2022,THE KITE,There it floated
2023,THE KITE,Among the birds and clouds at ease
2024,THE KITE,"Of others all unnoted,"
2025,THE KITE,Swimming above the ranked stiff trees.
2026,THE KITE,"And I lay down, looking up at the sky,"
2027,THE KITE,The clouds and birds that floated
2028,THE KITE,"By others still unnoted,"
2029,THE KITE,And that swaying kite
2030,THE KITE,Specking the light:
2031,THE KITE,"Looking up at the sky,"
2032,THE KITE,The birds and clouds that drew
2033,THE KITE,"Nearer, leaving the blue,"
2034,THE KITE,"Stooping, and then brushing me,"
2035,THE KITE,With such tenderness touching me
2036,THE KITE,That I had still lain there
2037,THE KITE,"In those fields bare,"
2038,THE KITE,Forgetting the kite;

2058,THE CHAIR,

2060,THE CHAIR,"The flame's snake-eyes,"
2061,THE CHAIR,Up the black-bearded chimney leap;
2062,THE CHAIR,Then on my shoulder my dull head would drop.

2078,THE CHAIR,

2093,THE CHAIR,

2107,THE CHAIR,"Myself your chief care, sitting by the hearth"
2108,THE CHAIR,
2109,THE CHAIR,"Propped in the pillowed chair,"

2121,THE SWING,It was like floating in a blessed dream to roam
2122,THE SWING,"Across green meadows, far from home,"
2123,THE SWING,"With only trees and quivering sky to hedge the sight,"
2124,THE SWING,Dazzling the eyes with strange delight.
2125,THE SWING,"Such wide, wide fields I had never seen, and never dreamed"
2126,THE SWING,Could be; and wonderful it seemed
2127,THE SWING,To wander over green and under green and run
2128,THE SWING,Unwatched even of the shining sun.
2129,THE SWING,
2130,THE SWING,One tree there was that held a wrinkled creaking bough
2131,THE SWING,"Far over the grass, hanging low;"
2132,THE SWING,And a swing from it hanging drew us near and made
2133,THE SWING,New brightness beneath that doming shade.
2134,THE SWING,"For there my sisters swung long hours delightedly,"
2135,THE SWING,And there delighted clambered I;
2136,THE SWING,And all our voices shrilled as one when up we flung
2137,THE SWING,And into the stinging sharp leaves swung.
2138,THE SWING,
2139,THE SWING,Then in a garden dense with bramble and sweet flowers
2140,THE SWING,"Where honeysuckle a new sweetness pours,"
2141,THE SWING,We sat and ate and drank. Well I remember how
2142,THE SWING,We were all shaded by one bough
2143,THE SWING,"Bending with red fruit over our uplifted eyes,"
2144,THE SWING,Teasing our well-watched covetousness.
2145,THE SWING,
2146,THE SWING,"And then we went back happy to the empty swing,"
2147,THE SWING,But I was tired of everything
2148,THE SWING,Except the grass and trees and the wide shadows there
2149,THE SWING,Widening slowly everywhere.
2150,THE SWING,It was like swinging in a solemn dream to roam
2151,THE SWING,"In a strange air, far from home--"
2152,THE SWING,"Until I saw the shadows suddenly wake and move,"
2153,THE SWING,"And float, float down from above."
2154,THE SWING,"Then I ran quickly back, round the large gloomy trees,"
2155,THE SWING,O with what shivering unease!
2156,THE SWING,"And stumbled where they waited, and was far too glad,"
2157,THE SWING,"Finding them, to be afraid or sad."
2158,THE SWING,--Then waited an unforgetting year once more to see
2159,THE SWING,"So wide a sky, so great a tree."

2222,THE STREETS,"Of all those hundreds, narrow, skyless, straight?)--"
2223,THE STREETS,
2224,THE STREETS,"Early and late, they were my woods and meadows;"
2225,THE STREETS,The rain upon their dust my summer smell;
2226,THE STREETS,Their scant herb and brown sparrows and harsh shadows
2227,THE STREETS,
2228,THE STREETS,Were all my spring. Was there another spring?
2229,THE STREETS,"I knew their noisy desolation well,"
2230,THE STREETS,"Drinking it up as a child drinks everything,"
2231,THE STREETS,
2232,THE STREETS,"Knowing no other world than brick and stone,"
2233,THE STREETS,With one rich memory of the earth all bright.
2234,THE STREETS,Now all is fallen into oblivion--
2235,THE STREETS,
2236,THE STREETS,"All that I was, in years of school and play,"
2237,THE STREETS,"Things that I hated, things that were delight,"
2238,THE STREETS,"Are all forgotten, or shut all away"
2239,THE STREETS,
2240,THE STREETS,Behind a creaking door that opens slow.
2241,THE STREETS,"But there's a child that walks those streets of war,"
2242,THE STREETS,Hearing his running footsteps as they go
2243,THE STREETS,
2244,THE STREETS,"Echoed from house to house, and wondering"
2245,THE STREETS,"At Marlboro', Waterloo and Trafalgar;"
2246,THE STREETS,"And at night, when the yellow gas lamps fling"
2247,THE STREETS,
2248,THE STREETS,"Unsteady shadows, singing for company;"
2249,THE STREETS,"Yet loving the lighted dark, and any star"
2250,THE STREETS,Caught by sharp roofs in a narrow net of sky.

2257,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2258,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2259,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,I can recall the day
2260,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,When childhood died.
2261,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,I had grown thin and tall
2262,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,And eager-eyed.
2263,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2264,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Such a false happiness
2265,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Had seized me then;
2266,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,"A child, I saw myself"
2267,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Man among men.
2268,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2269,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Now I see that I was
2270,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,"Ignorant, surprised,"
2271,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,As one for the surgeon's knife
2272,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Anæsthetized.
2273,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2274,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,So that I did not know
2275,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,"What loomed before,"
2276,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,"Nor how, a child, I became"
2277,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,A child no more.
2278,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2279,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,The world's sharpened knife
2280,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Cut round my heart;
2281,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Then something was taken
2282,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,And flung apart.
2283,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2284,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,"I did not, could not know"
2285,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,What had been done.
2286,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Under some evil drag
2287,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,I lived as one
2288,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2289,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,At home in the seeming world;
2290,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Then slowly came
2291,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Through years and years to myself
2292,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,And was no more the same.
2293,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2294,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,I know now an ill thing was done
2295,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,To a young child
2296,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,By the world's wary knife
2297,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,Maimed and defiled.
2298,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,
2299,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,I can recall the day
2300,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,"Almost without anger or pain,"
2301,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,When childhood did not die
2302,WHEN CHILDHOOD DIED,But was slain.

2332,THE SHOCK,"Of things that are of sense and spirit made,"
2333,THE SHOCK,"Of meadow flowers, dense hedges and dark bushes"
2334,THE SHOCK,With roses trailing over nests of thrushes;
2335,THE SHOCK,
2336,THE SHOCK,"Of dews so pure and bright and flush'd and cool,"
2337,THE SHOCK,And like the flowers as brief as beautiful;
2338,THE SHOCK,Thinking of the tall grass and daisies tall
2339,THE SHOCK,And whispered music of the waving bents;
2340,THE SHOCK,
2341,THE SHOCK,Of these that like a simple child I love
2342,THE SHOCK,Since they are life and life is flowers and grass;
2343,THE SHOCK,"Thinking of trees, and water at their feet"
2344,THE SHOCK,Answering the trees with murmur childlike sweet;
2345,THE SHOCK,
2346,THE SHOCK,Thinking of those high thoughts that passed like the wind
2347,THE SHOCK,"Yet left their brightness lying on the mind,"
2348,THE SHOCK,As the white blossoms the raw airs shake down
2349,THE SHOCK,That lie awhile yet lovely on the chill grass;
2350,THE SHOCK,
2351,THE SHOCK,"Thinking of the dark, where all these end like cloud,"
2352,THE SHOCK,"And the stars watch like Knights to Honour vowed,"
2353,THE SHOCK,"Of those too lovely colours of the East,"
2354,THE SHOCK,And the too tender loveliness of grey:
2355,THE SHOCK,
2356,THE SHOCK,"Thinking of all, I was as one that stands"
2357,THE SHOCK,'Neath the bewildering shock of breaking seas;
2358,THE SHOCK,"Mortal-immortal things had lost their power,"
2359,THE SHOCK,I knew no more than sweetness in the flower;
2360,THE SHOCK,
2361,THE SHOCK,"No more than colour in the changing light,"
2362,THE SHOCK,No more than order in the stars of night;
2363,THE SHOCK,A breathing tree was but gaunt wood and leaves;
2364,THE SHOCK,All these had lost their old power over me.
2365,THE SHOCK,
2366,THE SHOCK,I had forgotten that ever such things were:
2367,THE SHOCK,"Immortal-mortal, I had been but blind ..."
2368,THE SHOCK,O the wild sweetness of the renewing sense
2369,THE SHOCK,That swept me and drove all but sweetness hence!
2370,THE SHOCK,
2371,THE SHOCK,"... As beautiful as brief--ah! lovelier,"
2372,THE SHOCK,Being but mortal. Yet I had great fear--
2373,THE SHOCK,"That I should die ere these sweet things were dead,"

2380,THE UNLOOSENING,
2381,THE UNLOOSENING,
2382,THE UNLOOSENING,Winter was weary. All his snows were failing--
2383,THE UNLOOSENING,Still from his stiff grey head he shook the rime
2384,THE UNLOOSENING,"Upon the grasses, bushes and broad hedges,"
2385,THE UNLOOSENING,But all was lost in the new touch of Time.
2386,THE UNLOOSENING,
2387,THE UNLOOSENING,"And the bright-globèd hedges were all ruddy,"
2388,THE UNLOOSENING,As though warm sunset glowed perpetual.
2389,THE UNLOOSENING,"The myriad swinging tassels of first hazel,"
2390,THE UNLOOSENING,"From purple to pale gold, were swinging all"
2391,THE UNLOOSENING,
2392,THE UNLOOSENING,"In the soft wind, no more afraid of Winter."
2393,THE UNLOOSENING,"Nor chaffinch, wren, nor lark was now afraid."
2394,THE UNLOOSENING,"And Winter heard, or (ears too hard of hearing)"
2395,THE UNLOOSENING,Snuffed the South-West that in his cold hair played.
2396,THE UNLOOSENING,
2397,THE UNLOOSENING,And his hands trembled. Then with voice a-quaver
2398,THE UNLOOSENING,"He called the East Wind, and the black East ran,"
2399,THE UNLOOSENING,"Roofing the sky with iron, and in the darkness"
2400,THE UNLOOSENING,Winter crept out and chilled the earth again.
2401,THE UNLOOSENING,
2402,THE UNLOOSENING,"And while men slept the still pools were frozen,"
2403,THE UNLOOSENING,"Mosses were white, with ice the long grasses bowed;"
2404,THE UNLOOSENING,The hawthorn buds and the greening honeysuckle
2405,THE UNLOOSENING,"Froze, and the birds were dumb under that cloud."
2406,THE UNLOOSENING,
2407,THE UNLOOSENING,"And men and beasts were dulled, and children even"
2408,THE UNLOOSENING,"Less merry, under that low iron dome."
2409,THE UNLOOSENING,Early the patient rooks and starlings gathered;
2410,THE UNLOOSENING,Any warm narrow place for men was home.
2411,THE UNLOOSENING,
2412,THE UNLOOSENING,"And Winter laughed, but the third night grew weary,"
2413,THE UNLOOSENING,"And slept all heavy, till the East Wind thought him dead."
2414,THE UNLOOSENING,Then the returning South West in his nostrils
2415,THE UNLOOSENING,"Breathed, and his snows melted. And his head"
2416,THE UNLOOSENING,
2417,THE UNLOOSENING,"Uplifting, he saw all the laughing valley,"
2418,THE UNLOOSENING,Heard the unloosened waters leaping down
2419,THE UNLOOSENING,Broadening over the meadows; saw the sun running
2420,THE UNLOOSENING,From hill to hill and glittering upon the town.
2421,THE UNLOOSENING,
2422,THE UNLOOSENING,"All day he stared. But his head drooped at evening,"
2423,THE UNLOOSENING,Bent and slow he stumbled into the white
2424,THE UNLOOSENING,"Cavern of a great chalk hill, hedged with tall bushes,"
2425,THE UNLOOSENING,And in its darkness found a darker night
2426,THE UNLOOSENING,
2427,THE UNLOOSENING,"Among the broken cliff and falling water,"
2428,THE UNLOOSENING,Freezing or falling quietly everywhere;
2429,THE UNLOOSENING,"Locked in a long, long sleep, his brain undreaming,"
2430,THE UNLOOSENING,With only water moving anywhere.
2431,THE UNLOOSENING,
2432,THE UNLOOSENING,"Old men at night dreamed that they saw him going,"
2433,THE UNLOOSENING,"And looked, and dared not look, lest he should turn."
2434,THE UNLOOSENING,"And young men felt the air beating on their bodies,"
2435,THE UNLOOSENING,And the young women woke from dreams that burn.
2436,THE UNLOOSENING,
2437,THE UNLOOSENING,And children going through the fields at morning
2438,THE UNLOOSENING,"Saw the unloosened waters leaping down,"
2439,THE UNLOOSENING,And broke the hazel boughs and wore the tassels
2440,THE UNLOOSENING,Above their eyes--a pale and shaking crown.

2668,THE KESTREL,"Till it seemed the very earth could not be still,"
2669,THE KESTREL,"Nor could our hearts be still, nor could we think"
2670,THE KESTREL,"Our hearts could ever be still, our thought less fleet"
2671,THE KESTREL,"Than the dizzy clouds, less than the flying wind."
2672,THE KESTREL,Eastward the valley and the dark steep hill
2673,THE KESTREL,And other hills and valleys lost behind
2674,THE KESTREL,In mist and light. The hedges were not yet bare
2675,THE KESTREL,Though the wind picked at them as he went by.
2676,THE KESTREL,"The woods were fire, a fire that dense or clear"
2677,THE KESTREL,"Burned steady, but could not burn up the shadows"
2678,THE KESTREL,"Rooted where the trees' roots entangled lie,"
2679,THE KESTREL,In darkness; or a flame burned solitary
2680,THE KESTREL,"In the middle of the highest of brown meadows,"
2681,THE KESTREL,Burned solitary and unconsuming where
2682,THE KESTREL,A red tree stooped to its black shadow and
2683,THE KESTREL,The kestrel's shadow hunted the kestrel up the hill.
2684,THE KESTREL,"We climbed, and as we stood (where yet we stand"
2685,THE KESTREL,And of the visioned sun and shadow still drink)
2686,THE KESTREL,Happiness like a shadow chased our thought
2687,THE KESTREL,That tossed on free wings up and down the world;
2688,THE KESTREL,Till by that wild swift-darting shadow caught
2689,THE KESTREL,Our free spirits their free pinions furled.
2690,THE KESTREL,Then as the kestrel began once more the heavens to climb
2691,THE KESTREL,A new-winged spirit rose clear above the hills of time.

2710,THE IMAGE,"With those high clouds, quiet and white as snow--"
2711,THE IMAGE,Spiritual company; and when day's gone

2837,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Unless first in the dark night of the mind
2838,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Love had fulfilled what Love had well designed.
2839,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,
2840,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"Was it in thought or flesh we walked, when low"
2841,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"The sun dropped, and the white scar on the hill"
2842,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Sank into the dark trees?
2843,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Could we indeed so quietly go
2844,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Body by body into that heavenly glow?
2845,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,
2846,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,The elms that rose so vast above the mill
2847,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Near leafless were and still;
2848,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,But from the branches with such loud unease
2849,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Black flocking starlings mixed their warring cries
2850,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,That seemed the greater noise of the creaking mill;
2851,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,And every branch and extreme twig was black
2852,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"With birds that whistled and heard and whistled back,"
2853,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Filling with noise as late with wings the skies.
2854,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"Was it their noise we heard,"
2855,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Or clamour of other thoughts in our quiet mind that stirred?
2856,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,
2857,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Then through the climbing hazel hedge new thinned
2858,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"By the early and rapacious wind,"
2859,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,We saw the silver birches gleam with light
2860,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Of frozen masts in seas all wild and green.
2861,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"O, were they truly trees, or some unseen"
2862,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Thought taking on an image dark and bright?
2863,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"And did those bodies see them, or the mind?"
2864,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,And did those bodies face once more the hill
2865,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,"To bathe in night, or on a darker road"
2866,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Our spirits unseeing unwearying rise and rise
2867,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,Where these feet never trod?
2868,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,
2869,THE DARK NIGHT OF THE MIND,From that familiar outer darkness I

2878,THE BODY,
2879,THE BODY,
2880,THE BODY,"When I had dreamed and dreamed what woman's beauty was,"
2881,THE BODY,"And how that beauty seen from unseen surely flowed,"
2882,THE BODY,"I turned and dreamed again, but sleeping now no more:"
2883,THE BODY,My eyes shut and my mind with inward vision glowed.
2884,THE BODY,
2885,THE BODY,"""I did not think!"" I cried, seeing that wavering shape"
2886,THE BODY,"That steadied and then wavered, as a cherry bough in June"
2887,THE BODY,Lifts and falls in the wind--each fruit a fruit of light;
2888,THE BODY,And then she stood as clear as an unclouded moon.
2889,THE BODY,
2890,THE BODY,"As clear and still she stood, moonlike remotely near;"
2891,THE BODY,"I saw and heard her breathe, I years and years away."
2892,THE BODY,"Her light streamed through the years, I saw her clear and still,"
2893,THE BODY,Shape and spirit together mingling night with day.
2894,THE BODY,
2895,THE BODY,"Water falling, falling with the curve of time"
2896,THE BODY,"Over green-hued rock, then plunging to its pool"
2897,THE BODY,"Far, far below, a falling spear of light;"
2898,THE BODY,Water falling golden from the sun but moonlike cool:
2899,THE BODY,
2900,THE BODY,"Water has the curve of her shoulder and breast,"
2901,THE BODY,"Water falls as straight as her body rose,"
2902,THE BODY,"Water her brightness has from neck to still feet,"
2903,THE BODY,Water crystal-cold as her cold body flows.
2904,THE BODY,
2905,THE BODY,"But not water has the colour I saw when I dreamed,"
2906,THE BODY,Nor water such strength has. I joyed to behold
2907,THE BODY,How the blood lit her body with lamps of fire
2908,THE BODY,And made the flesh glow that like water gleamed cold.
2909,THE BODY,
2910,THE BODY,"A flame in her arms and in each finger flame,"
2911,THE BODY,"And flame in her bosom, flame above, below,"
2912,THE BODY,The curve of climbing flame in her waist and her thighs;
2913,THE BODY,From foot to head did flame into red flame flow.
2914,THE BODY,
2915,THE BODY,"I knew how beauty seen from unseen must rise,"
2916,THE BODY,How the body's joy for more than body's use was made.
2917,THE BODY,"I knew then how the body is the body of the mind,"
2918,THE BODY,And how the mind's own fire beneath the cool skin played.
2919,THE BODY,
2920,THE BODY,"O shape that once to have seen is to see evermore,"
2921,THE BODY,"Falling stream that falls to the deeps of the mind,"
2922,THE BODY,"Fire that once lit burns while aught burns in the world,"
2923,THE BODY,Foot to head a flame moving in the spirit's wind!
2924,THE BODY,
2925,THE BODY,If these eyes could see what these eyes have not seen--
2926,THE BODY,"The inward vision clear--how should I look for joy,"
2927,THE BODY,Knowing that beauty's self rose visible in the world
2928,THE BODY,"Over age that darkens, and griefs that destroy?"

2937,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,A sad old God had dreamed in loneliness of power.
2938,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,They were like dreams that in his drowsy mind
2939,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"Rose slowly and then, darkening, made him wise and blind--"
2940,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"So that he saw no more the level sun,"
2941,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Nor the small solid shadow of unclouded noon.
2942,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,The dark green heights rose slowly from the green
2943,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Of the dark water till the sky was narrowly seen;
2944,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"Only at night the lifting walls were still,"
2945,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,And stars were bright and calm above each calm dark hill.
2946,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,... I could not think but that a God grown old
2947,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Saw in a dream or waking all this round of bold
2948,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"And wavelike hills, and knew them but a thought,"
2949,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Or but a wave uptost and poised awhile then caught
2950,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Back to the sea with waves a million more
2951,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,That rise and pause and break at last upon the shore.
2952,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"A God, a God saw first those hills that I"
2953,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Saw now immense upholding the starry crowded sky:
2954,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"His breath the mist that clung their shoulders round,"
2955,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,His slow unconscious sigh that easeless floating sound.
2956,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Ere mine his thought failed under each rough height
2957,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"And then was brave, seeing the stars climb calm and bright."
2958,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"Ere they were named he named them in his mood,"
2959,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Like varying children of one giant warring brood--
2960,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"Broad-Foot, Cloud-Gatherer, Long-Back, Winter-Head,"
2961,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Bravery and Bright-Face and that long Home of the Dead;
2962,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,And their still waters glittering in his glance
2963,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"Named Buckler, Silver Dish, Two Eyes and Shining Lance,"
2964,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"Names unrecorded, but the circling wind"
2965,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Remembers and repeats them to the listening mind....
2966,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,That mind was mine. At Shining Lance I stared
2967,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Between Long-Back and Winter-Head as the new sun bared
2968,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,The Lake and heights of shadow and the wan gold
2969,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Deepened and new warmth came into the light's sharp cold.
2970,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,And the near trees shivered no more but shook
2971,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Their music over Shining Lance; and the excited brook
2972,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Freshened in the sun's eye and tossed his spray
2973,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"High and sparkling, and then sprang dancing, dancing away."
2974,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"But Winter-Head and Long-Back, gravely bright,"
2975,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,Stood firm as if for ever and a day and a night--
2976,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,As they were more than a wave before 'tis caught
2977,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,"Back to the tossing tide, more than a flying thought,"
2978,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,More than a dream that an old God once dreamed
2979,THE TOSSING MOUNTAINS,When visionary not at all visionary seemed.

3012,THE POND,And mingling that most sweet thing
3013,THE POND,With the sweet note of thrushes.
3014,THE POND,
3015,THE POND,"That sweetness rose all round me,"

3496,THE WREN,As I go out

3498,THE WREN,

3509,THE WREN,Like stars in broken sleep.

3555,THE WINDS,"And look down on the new earth in flight,"
3556,THE WINDS,Shadow-like cast my thought's thin shroud
3557,THE WINDS,Back upon these fields of light;
3558,THE WINDS,And hear the winds of day and night
3559,THE WINDS,"Meet, singing loud!"

3565,THE WANDERER,
3566,THE WANDERER,
3567,THE WANDERER,Over the pool of sleep
3568,THE WANDERER,"The night mists creep,"
3569,THE WANDERER,"Then faint thin light and then clear day,"
3570,THE WANDERER,"Noontide, and lingering afternoon;"
3571,THE WANDERER,"Then that Wanderer, the Moon"
3572,THE WANDERER,Wandering her old wild way.
3573,THE WANDERER,
3574,THE WANDERER,How many spirits follow
3575,THE WANDERER,Her in that dark hollow!
3576,THE WANDERER,Like a lost lamb she roams on high
3577,THE WANDERER,"Through the cold and soundless sky,"
3578,THE WANDERER,And stares down into her deep
3579,THE WANDERER,Reflection in the pool of sleep.
3580,THE WANDERER,
3581,THE WANDERER,How many follow
3582,THE WANDERER,Her in that lone hollow!
3583,THE WANDERER,She sees them not nor would she hear
3584,THE WANDERER,"Though both shape and sound were clear,"
3585,THE WANDERER,"But stares, stares into the pool"
3586,THE WANDERER,Of her fear and beauty full.
3587,THE WANDERER,
3588,THE WANDERER,Far in strange gay skies
3589,THE WANDERER,"She pales and dies,"
3590,THE WANDERER,Forgetting that bright transitory
3591,THE WANDERER,"Reflection of astonished glory,"
3592,THE WANDERER,Nor heeds the spirits that follow
3593,THE WANDERER,Her into day's bright hollow.

3599,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3600,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3601,MERRILL'S GARDEN,There is a garden where the seeded stems of thin long grass are bowed
3602,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Beneath July's slow rains and heat and tired children's trailing feet;
3603,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"And the trees' neglected branches droop and make a cloud beneath the cloud,"
3604,MERRILL'S GARDEN,And in that dark the crimson dew of raspberries shines more sweet than
3605,MERRILL'S GARDEN,sweet.
3606,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3607,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"The flower of the tall acacia's gone, the acacia's flower is white no more,"
3608,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"The aspen lifts his pithless arms, the aspen leaves are close and still;"
3609,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"The wind that tossed the clouds along, gray clouds and white like feathers"
3610,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"bore,"
3611,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Lets even a feather faintly fall and smoke spread hugely where it will.
3612,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3613,MERRILL'S GARDEN,But though the acacia's flower is gone and raspberries bear bright fruit
3614,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"untasted,"
3615,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Beauty lives there, oh rich and rare, past the sum of eager June."
3616,MERRILL'S GARDEN,The lime tree's pyramid of flower and leaf and yellow flower unwasted
3617,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Rises at eve and bars the breast wild-heaving of the timid moon.
3618,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3619,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Now the tall pear-trees unrebuked lift their green fingers to the sky;
3620,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Their lower boughs are crossed like arms of templars in long stony sleep.
3621,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Their arms are crossed as though the wind, returning from wild war on high,"
3622,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Had touched them with an angry breath, or whispered from his cavern deep."
3623,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3624,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"A foxglove lifts her bells and bells silent above the singing grass,"
3625,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Still the old marigold her light sprinkles like riches to the poor.
3626,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Snapdragon still his changeling blossom shakes with the burden of the bees,"
3627,MERRILL'S GARDEN,And the strong bindweed creeps and winds and springs on high a conqueror.
3628,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3629,MERRILL'S GARDEN,*       *       *       *       *
3630,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3631,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Would now her eyes grieve to behold snapdragon, foxglove, marigold"
3632,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Daily diminish in their sweet and bindweed wreathing over all--
3633,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Weed and grass and weed and grass, friendless, melancholy, cold,"
3634,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Wreathing the earth like wreathing snow from bare wall to low greening
3635,MERRILL'S GARDEN,wall?
3636,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3637,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Old were her eyes that lingered on old trees and grass and flowers trim.
3638,MERRILL'S GARDEN,She smelt the ripe pears when they drooped and fell and broke upon the
3639,MERRILL'S GARDEN,path.
3640,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Old were her thoughts of things of old; her present thoughts were few and
3641,MERRILL'S GARDEN,dim;
3642,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Her eyes saw not the things she saw; she listened, to no living breath."
3643,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3644,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Her youth and prime and autumn time bloomed in her thought all light and
3645,MERRILL'S GARDEN,sweet:
3646,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"No wallflower more of sweet could hold, of sunny light no marigold."
3647,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Fruit on her mind's boughs ripened full, in summer's and calm autumn's"
3648,MERRILL'S GARDEN,heat:
3649,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Then fell, for there came none to pick; but winter came, and she was old."
3650,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3651,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Now if her sons come they will find--not her: her empty garden only,"
3652,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"The wallflower done and snapdragon still swinging with the greedy bees,"
3653,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Marigold glittering in the grass, scant foxglove ringing faintly, lonely,"
3654,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Close red fruit beading the long boughs and bindweed wreathing where it
3655,MERRILL'S GARDEN,please.
3656,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3657,MERRILL'S GARDEN,A tawny lean cat _Marmalade_ slinks like a panther through the tall
3658,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Thin bending grass and watches long a scholar thrush rehearsing song;
3659,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Or children running in the sun hunt and hunt a well lost ball;
3660,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"But most the garden sleeps away the day, but still, when eves are long,"
3661,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3662,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"When eves are long and no moon rises, and nervous, still, is all the air,"
3663,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"That small stiff figure moves again, silent amid the hushing grass;"
3664,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"In the firm-carven lime tree's shade she moves, and meets her old thoughts"
3665,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"there,"
3666,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Then in the deepening dark is lost, or her light steps unnoted pass."
3667,MERRILL'S GARDEN,
3668,MERRILL'S GARDEN,"Only that careless garden keeps secure her memory though it sleeps,"
3669,MERRILL'S GARDEN,And the bright flowers and tyrant weed and tall grass shaking its loud seed
3670,MERRILL'S GARDEN,Less lovely were if wanting her who like a living thought still creeps
3671,MERRILL'S GARDEN,And sees what once she saw and music hears of her living sons and dead.

3680,THE LIME TREE,(If it was a lime tree) showed her yellow leaves
3681,THE LIME TREE,Above the renewed green of wet August grass--
3682,THE LIME TREE,First Autumn yellow that on first Autumn eves
3683,THE LIME TREE,Too soon was found.
3684,THE LIME TREE,
3685,THE LIME TREE,Comfortless lime tree! Scarce an aspen leaf
3686,THE LIME TREE,Like a green butterfly flitted to the ground;
3687,THE LIME TREE,There was no sign of Autumn in the grass.
3688,THE LIME TREE,Even the long garden beds their beauty brief--
3689,THE LIME TREE,"Their mignonette,"
3690,THE LIME TREE,
3691,THE LIME TREE,"Nasturtium and sweet-william and red stocks,"
3692,THE LIME TREE,"And clover crouching in the border grass,"
3693,THE LIME TREE,"And blood-like fuschia, eve's primrose and white phlox"
3694,THE LIME TREE,And honeysuckle--waved all their smell and hue
3695,THE LIME TREE,Morn and eve anew.
3696,THE LIME TREE,
3697,THE LIME TREE,"But that far lime tree yellowing by the oak,"
3698,THE LIME TREE,"Warning oak, elm and poplar and each fresh tree"
3699,THE LIME TREE,"Shaking in the south wind delightedly,"
3700,THE LIME TREE,"And clover in the closeness of the grass,"
3701,THE LIME TREE,Warns also me.
3702,THE LIME TREE,
3703,THE LIME TREE,And now when all the trees are standing still
3704,THE LIME TREE,"Beneath the purple and white of the west sky,"
3705,THE LIME TREE,And time is standing still--as stand it will--
3706,THE LIME TREE,That early yellowing lime with palsied fingers
3707,THE LIME TREE,Cannot be still.

3722,DARK CHESTNUT,"O, darker, softer fall her thoughts"
3723,DARK CHESTNUT,"Upon the cold fields of my mind,"

3725,DARK CHESTNUT,Like leaf-shapes trembling in least wind:

3730,DARK CHESTNUT,"Dark chestnut, though you see her not;"

3756,THE CREEPER,
3757,THE CREEPER,
3758,THE CREEPER,It covered all
3759,THE CREEPER,"The cold east wall,"
3760,THE CREEPER,"Its green, thin gold, purple, brown,"
3761,THE CREEPER,And flame running up and down;
3762,THE CREEPER,Lifting its quiet bosom to every wind that crept
3763,THE CREEPER,Up the high wall and in its darkness slept.
3764,THE CREEPER,Then when the wind slept all the creeper turned
3765,THE CREEPER,To undiminishing fire that burned and burned and burned.
3766,THE CREEPER,
3767,THE CREEPER,But one black night
3768,THE CREEPER,(For not in the light
3769,THE CREEPER,May such treacheries be done)
3770,THE CREEPER,Came with dishonoured weapon one
3771,THE CREEPER,And cut the stem just where the branches thin
3772,THE CREEPER,Their million-leaf'd wild wandering begin:
3773,THE CREEPER,"Cut the firm stem quite through, and so it bled,"
3774,THE CREEPER,And all the million leaves shivered and hung there dead.
3775,THE CREEPER,
3776,THE CREEPER,"The wall how cold,"
3777,THE CREEPER,The house how old
3778,THE CREEPER,"Became when that warm bright fire died,"
3779,THE CREEPER,And the fond wind could no more hide.
3780,THE CREEPER,And it was strange that so much death could be
3781,THE CREEPER,From one dark night-hour's darker felony;
3782,THE CREEPER,And how the leaves being dead could not cast down
3783,THE CREEPER,Their colours in bright pools of red and gold and brown.
3784,THE CREEPER,
3785,THE CREEPER,"--It did not die,"
3786,THE CREEPER,But flamed on high
3787,THE CREEPER,"Morn after morn, even when white snow"
3788,THE CREEPER,"Covered all brightness, high and low;"
3789,THE CREEPER,And in the night when the snow glimmered wan
3790,THE CREEPER,Still beautiful as a fire its brightness shone:
3791,THE CREEPER,"Its million quiet leaves quivering in my mind,"
3792,THE CREEPER,When from no earthly meadows crept the remembered wind.

3838,QUEENS,"And all those lances vail'd, and solemn Knights"

3862,THE RED HOUSE,By the tossed foam of the not yet frozen brook
3863,THE RED HOUSE,Black pigs go straggling over fields of snow;

4412,THE PIGEONS,"Though still the frost-flower blinded the window-pane,"
4413,THE PIGEONS,"And touched their mother and touched her hand in vain,"
4414,THE PIGEONS,And wondered why she woke not when they woke;
4415,THE PIGEONS,And wondered what it was their sleep that broke
4416,THE PIGEONS,"When hand in hand they stared and stared, so frightened;"
4417,THE PIGEONS,"They feared and waited, and waited all day long"
4418,THE PIGEONS,"While all the shadows went and the day brightened,"
4419,THE PIGEONS,All the ill shadows but one shadow strong.
4420,THE PIGEONS,
4421,THE PIGEONS,Outside were busy feet and human speech
4422,THE PIGEONS,"And daily cries and horns. Maybe they heard,"
4423,THE PIGEONS,"Painfully wondering still, and each to each"
4424,THE PIGEONS,"Leaning, and listening if their mother stirred--"
4425,THE PIGEONS,"Cold, cold,"
4426,THE PIGEONS,"Hungering as the long slow hours grew old,"
4427,THE PIGEONS,Though food within the cupboard idle lay
4428,THE PIGEONS,"Beyond their thought, or but beyond their reach."
4429,THE PIGEONS,The soft blue pigeons all the afternoon
4430,THE PIGEONS,"Sunned themselves on the roof or rose at play,"
4431,THE PIGEONS,Then with the shrinking light fluttered away;
4432,THE PIGEONS,"And once more came the icy hearted moon,"
4433,THE PIGEONS,Staring down at the frightened children there
4434,THE PIGEONS,That could but shiver and stare.
4435,THE PIGEONS,
4436,THE PIGEONS,"... How many hours, how many days, who knows?"
4437,THE PIGEONS,Neighbours there were who thought they had gone away
4438,THE PIGEONS,To return some luckier or luckless day.
4439,THE PIGEONS,No sound came from the room: the cold air froze
4440,THE PIGEONS,The very echo of the children's sighs.
4441,THE PIGEONS,"And what they saw within each other's eyes,"
4442,THE PIGEONS,Or heard each other's heart say as they peered
4443,THE PIGEONS,"At the dead mother lying there, and feared"
4444,THE PIGEONS,"That she might wake, and then might never wake,"
4445,THE PIGEONS,"Who knows, who knows?"
4446,THE PIGEONS,None heard a living sound their silence break.
4447,THE PIGEONS,
4448,THE PIGEONS,In those cold days and nights how many birds
4449,THE PIGEONS,Flittering above the fields and streams all frozen
4450,THE PIGEONS,Watched hungrily the tended flocks and herds--
4451,THE PIGEONS,Earth's chosen nourished by earth's wise self-chosen!
4452,THE PIGEONS,How many birds suddenly stiffened and died
4453,THE PIGEONS,"With no plaint cried,"
4454,THE PIGEONS,The starved heart ceasing when the pale sun ceased!
4455,THE PIGEONS,And when the new day stepped from the same cold East
4456,THE PIGEONS,"The dead birds lay in the light on the snow-flecked field,"
4457,THE PIGEONS,Their song and beautiful free winging stilled.
4458,THE PIGEONS,
4459,THE PIGEONS,"I walked under snow-sprinkled hills at night,"
4460,THE PIGEONS,"And starry sprinkled, skies deep blue and bright."
4461,THE PIGEONS,The keen wind thrust with his knife against the thin
4462,THE PIGEONS,Breast of the wood as I went tingling by
4463,THE PIGEONS,And heard a weak cheep-cheep--no more--the cry
4464,THE PIGEONS,Of a bird that crouched the smitten wood within....
4465,THE PIGEONS,But no one heeded that sharp spiritual cry
4466,THE PIGEONS,"Of the two children in their misery,"
4467,THE PIGEONS,When in the cold and famished night death's shade
4468,THE PIGEONS,More terrible the moon's cold shadows made.
4469,THE PIGEONS,How was it none could hear
4470,THE PIGEONS,"That bodiless crying, birdlike, sharp and clear?"
4471,THE PIGEONS,
4472,THE PIGEONS,"I cannot think what they, unanswered, thought"
4473,THE PIGEONS,When the night came again and shadows moved
4474,THE PIGEONS,"As the moon through the ice-flower stared and roved,"
4475,THE PIGEONS,And that unyielding Shadow came again.
4476,THE PIGEONS,That Shadow came again unseen and caught
4477,THE PIGEONS,"The children as they sat listening in vain,"
4478,THE PIGEONS,Their starved hearts failing ere the Shadow removed.
4479,THE PIGEONS,And when the new morn stepped from the same cold East
4480,THE PIGEONS,"They lay unawakening in the barren light,"
4481,THE PIGEONS,"Their song and their imaginations bright,"
4482,THE PIGEONS,Their pains and fears and all bewilderment ceased....
4483,THE PIGEONS,While the brief sun gave
4484,THE PIGEONS,"New beauty to the death-flower of the frost,"
4485,THE PIGEONS,"And pigeons in the frore air swooped and tossed,"
4486,THE PIGEONS,And glad eyes were more glad and grave less grave.
4487,THE PIGEONS,
4488,THE PIGEONS,"There is not pity enough in heaven or earth,"
4489,THE PIGEONS,"There is not love enough, if children die"
4490,THE PIGEONS,"Like famished birds--oh, less mercifully."
4491,THE PIGEONS,A great wrong's done when such as these go forth
4492,THE PIGEONS,"Into the starless dark, broken and bruised,"
4493,THE PIGEONS,"With mind and sweet affection all confused,"
4494,THE PIGEONS,And horror closing round them as they go.
4495,THE PIGEONS,There is not pity enough!
4496,THE PIGEONS,
4497,THE PIGEONS,"And I have made, children, these verses for you,"
4498,THE PIGEONS,"Lasting a little longer than your breath,"
4499,THE PIGEONS,Because I have been haunted with your death;
4500,THE PIGEONS,So men are driven to things they hate to do.
4501,THE PIGEONS,"Jesus, forgive us all our happiness,"
4502,THE PIGEONS,As Thou dost blot out all our miseries.

4879,THE HUMAN MUSIC,THE HUMAN MUSIC
4880,THE HUMAN MUSIC,
4881,THE HUMAN MUSIC,
4882,THE HUMAN MUSIC,At evening when the aspens rustled soft
4883,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And the last blackbird by the hedge-nest laughed,"
4884,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And through the leaves the moon's unmeaning face
4885,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Looked, and then rose in dark-blue leafless space;"
4886,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Watching the trees and moon she could not bear
4887,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The silence and the presence everywhere.
4888,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The blackbird called the silence and it came
4889,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Closing and closing round like smoke round flame.
4890,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Into her heart it crept and the heart was numb,"
4891,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Even wishes died, and all but fear was dumb--"
4892,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Fear and its phantoms. Then the trees were enlarged,"
4893,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And from their roundness unguessed shapes emerged,"
4894,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Or no shape but the image of her fear
4895,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Creeping forth from her mind and hovering near.
4896,THE HUMAN MUSIC,If a bat flitted it was an evil thing;
4897,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Sadder the trees grew with every shadowy wing--
4898,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Their shape enlarged, their arms quivered, their thought"
4899,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Stirring in the leaves a silent anguish wrought.
4900,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"""What are they thinking of, the evil trees,"
4901,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Nod-nodding, standing in malignant ease?"
4902,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Something against man's mortal heart was sworn
4903,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Once, when their dark Powers were conceived and born;"
4904,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And in such fading or such lightless hours
4905,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"The world is delivered to these plotting Powers."""
4906,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"No physical swift blow she dreaded, not"
4907,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Lightning's quick mercy; but her heart grew hot
4908,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And cold and hot with uncomprehended sense
4909,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Of an assassin spiritual influence
4910,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Moving in the unmoving trees....
4911,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Till, as she stared,"
4912,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Her eyes turned cowards at last, and no more dared."
4913,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Yet could she never rise and shut the door:
4914,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Perhaps those Powers would batter at the door,"
4915,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And that were madness. So right through the house
4916,THE HUMAN MUSIC,She set the doors all wide when she could arouse
4917,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The body's energy to serve the mind.
4918,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Then the air would move, and any little wind"
4919,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Would cleanse awhile the darkness and diminish
4920,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Her fear, and the dumb shadow-war would finish."
4921,THE HUMAN MUSIC,
4922,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"But it was not the trees, the birds, the moon;"
4923,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Birds cease, months fly, green seasons wither soon:"
4924,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Nature was constant all the seasons through,"
4925,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Sinister, watchful, and a thick cloud drew"
4926,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Over the mind when its simplicity
4927,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Challenged what seemed with thought of what must be....
4928,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She wondered, seeing how a child could play"
4929,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Lightly in a shady field all day:
4930,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"For in that golden, brief, benignant weather"
4931,THE HUMAN MUSIC,When spring and summer calling run together
4932,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And the sun's fresh and hot, she saw deep guile"
4933,THE HUMAN MUSIC,In the sweetness of that unconditioned smile.
4934,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Sweetness not sweetness was but indifference
4935,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Or wantonness disguised, to her grave sense;"
4936,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And if she could have seen the things she felt
4937,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She'd looked for darkness, and lit shapes that knelt"
4938,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Appealing, unregarded, at a high"
4939,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Altar uprising from the pit to the sky....
4940,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Had the trees consciousness, with flowers and clouds"
4941,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And winds that hung like thin clouds in the woods,"
4942,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And stars and silence:--had they each a mind
4943,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Bending on hers, clear eyes on her eyes blind?"
4944,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"In the green dense heights--elm, oak, ash, yew or beech"
4945,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She scarce saw--was there not a brain in each,"
4946,THE HUMAN MUSIC,An undiscovered centre of quick nerves
4947,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"By which (like man) the tree lives, masters, serves,"
4948,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Waxes and wanes? Oppressed her mind would shrink
4949,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"From thought, and into her trembling body sink."
4950,THE HUMAN MUSIC,
4951,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Something of this had childhood taught her when
4952,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Sickly she lay and peered again and again
4953,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"At gray skies and white skies and void bright blue,"
4954,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And watched the sun the bare town-tree boughs through,"
4955,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And then through leafy boughs and once more bare.
4956,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Or in the west country's heavy hill-drawn air
4957,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Had felt the green grass pushing within her veins,"
4958,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Tangling and strangling: and the warm spring rains
4959,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Tapping all night upon her childish head:
4960,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She shivered, lying lonely on her bed,"
4961,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"With all that life all round and she so weak,"
4962,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Longing to speak--yet what was there to speak?
4963,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And as she grew and health came and love came
4964,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And life was happier, happier, still the same"
4965,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Inhuman spirit rose whenever she
4966,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Held in her thoughts more than her eyes could see.
4967,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Behind the happiest hours the dark cloud hung
4968,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Distant or nearing, and its dullness flung"
4969,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"On the south meadows of her thought, the fairest"
4970,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Shrinking in shadow; aspirations rarest
4971,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Falling, like shot birds in a reedy fen,"
4972,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Slain by the old Enemy of men.
4973,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Life ebbed while men strove for the means of life;
4974,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The grudging earth turned labour into strife.
4975,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The moving hosts within the heavy clod
4976,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Seemed infinite in malice; frost and flood,"
4977,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Season and inter-season, were conspired"
4978,THE HUMAN MUSIC,In smiling or sour mockery; and untired
4979,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And undelighted, man scratched and scratched on,"
4980,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And what he did, by Nature was undone."
4981,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She saw men twisted more than rocks or trees,"
4982,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Bruised, numbed, by age and labour and the disease"
4983,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Of labour in the cold fields; women worn
4984,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"By many child-bearings, and their self-scorn"
4985,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Because of time and their lost woman's powers.
4986,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Bitter was Nature to women; for those hours
4987,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Of the spirit's and the body's first delight
4988,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Passed soon, and the long day, evening, night"
4989,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Of life uncherished; bitterest when even
4990,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"That brief hour was denied, of dancing heaven,"
4991,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Dewy love, and fulfilled desires."
4992,THE HUMAN MUSIC,But age
4993,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Of all ills made her pity and anger rage.
4994,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"To see and smell the calm months bud and bloom,"
4995,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"April's first warmth, June's hues and slow perfume,"
4996,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The sweetness drifting by in those long hours
4997,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"While, out of her she nursed, the vital powers"
4998,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Were pressed by pain and pressed by pain renewed,"
4999,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Till, closing the life-long vicissitude,"
5000,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Came starving death with full-heaped summer, and"
5001,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Wrung the last pangs that spirit could withstand ...
5002,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Or to see age in its prison slowly freeze
5003,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"With impotence more disastrous than disease,"
5004,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"While trees flowered on, or all the winter through"
5005,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Upheld brave arms and with spring flowered anew
5006,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Above those living graves and graves of the dead;--
5007,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"'Twas all such bitterness, but she nothing said."
5008,THE HUMAN MUSIC,She saw men as courageous boats that sailed
5009,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"On all the seas, and some a far port hailed"
5010,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Perhaps to sail again, or anchor there"
5011,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Forever; some would quietly disappear
5012,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"In stormless waters, and some in storms be broken"
5013,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And all be hidden and no clear meaning spoken,"
5014,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Nor any trace upon the waters linger.
5015,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Where the boat went the wind with hasty finger,"
5016,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Savage and sly as aught of land could be,"
5017,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Erased the little wrinkling of the sea.
5018,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"O, in such enmity was man enisled,"
5019,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Such loneliness, by foolish shades beguiled,"
5020,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"That it was bravery to see and live,"
5021,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"But cowardice to see and to forgive,"
5022,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"The wrong of evil, the wrong of death to life,"
5023,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"The defeat of innocence, the waste of strife,--"
5024,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"The heavy ills of time, injustice, pain--"
5025,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"In field and forest and flood rose huge and plain,"
5026,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Brushing her mind with darkness, till she thought"
5027,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Not with her brain, but all her nerves were wrought"
5028,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Into an apprehension burning strong,"
5029,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Unslackening, of mortality's old wrong."
5030,THE HUMAN MUSIC,But if her eyes she raised to those clear lonely
5031,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Altitudes of stars and ether only,"
5032,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Her eyes fell and rebuked her as forbidden
5033,THE HUMAN MUSIC,With human mind to question what was hidden.
5034,THE HUMAN MUSIC,At summer dusk the broad moon rising high
5035,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Put gentleness in the vast strength of the sky,"
5036,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Easing its weight; or the hot summer sun
5037,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Made noonday kind, and the hours lightly run."
5038,THE HUMAN MUSIC,But in those blazing midnights of the stars
5039,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Gathered and brightening for immortal wars
5040,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"With spears and darts and arrows of sharp light,"
5041,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She read the indifference of the infinite,"
5042,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The high strife flashing through eternity
5043,THE HUMAN MUSIC,While on the earth stared mortals but as she.
5044,THE HUMAN MUSIC,
5045,THE HUMAN MUSIC,O 'twas a living world that rose around
5046,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And in her sentience burned a hollow wound.
5047,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Such easy brightness as the poets see,"
5048,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Or easy gloom, or hues of faerie,"
5049,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She never saw, but into her own heart peered"
5050,THE HUMAN MUSIC,To find what spirit indeed it was she feared:--
5051,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Whether in antique days a divine foe
5052,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Sprung branchlike from dense woods had wrought her woe;
5053,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Whether in antique days a pagan rite
5054,THE HUMAN MUSIC,(Herself a pagan still) unfilmed her sight
5055,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"And taught her secrets never to be forgot,"
5056,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And by man's generation pardoned not....
5057,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The same blood in ancestral veins ran fleet
5058,THE HUMAN MUSIC,As now made hers a road for pain's quick feet.
5059,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Into the marrow of her hidden life
5060,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Had poured the agony of their termless strife
5061,THE HUMAN MUSIC,With immaterial and material things;
5062,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And as a bird an unlearned music sings
5063,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Because a million generations sang,"
5064,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"So in her breast the old alarum rang,"
5065,THE HUMAN MUSIC,So the old sorrowfulness in her thought
5066,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Renewed, and apprehensions all untaught;"
5067,THE HUMAN MUSIC,As if indeed a creature primitive
5068,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Still did she in the world's dim morning live,"
5069,THE HUMAN MUSIC,That wanted human warmth and gentleness
5070,THE HUMAN MUSIC,To make its solitude a little less.
5071,THE HUMAN MUSIC,
5072,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Kindness gave solitude the lovely light
5073,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"She loved, and made less terrible black midnight."
5074,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Even as a bird its unlearned music pours
5075,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Though windows all be blind and shut the doors,"
5076,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And sings on still though no faint sound be heard
5077,THE HUMAN MUSIC,But wind and leaves and another lonely bird:
5078,THE HUMAN MUSIC,So poured she untaught kindness all around
5079,THE HUMAN MUSIC,And in that human music comfort found--
5080,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Music her own and music heard from others,"
5081,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Prime music of all lovers, children, mothers,"
5082,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Precarious music between all men sounding,"
5083,THE HUMAN MUSIC,The horror of silent and dark Powers confounding.
5084,THE HUMAN MUSIC,Singing that music she could bravely live;
5085,THE HUMAN MUSIC,"Hearing it, find less sorrow to forgive."

5214,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Sleep like water or cool cider;
5215,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Life flowed over and I sank
5216,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Down below the night of clouds....
5217,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Then on a pale horse was rider
5218,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Through long brushing woods
5219,THE BRIGHT RIDER,"Where the owl in silence broods,"
5220,THE BRIGHT RIDER,"Quavers, and is quiet again;"
5221,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Where the grass dark and rank
5222,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Breathes on the still air its rain.
5223,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Rain and dark and green and sound
5224,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Closing slowly round
5225,THE BRIGHT RIDER,"Swept me as I rode,"
5226,THE BRIGHT RIDER,And rode on until I came
5227,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Where a white cold river flowed
5228,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Under woods thin and bare
5229,THE BRIGHT RIDER,In the moon's long candle flame.
5230,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Through the woods the wind crawled
5231,THE BRIGHT RIDER,"Leviathan, and here and there"
5232,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Branches creaked and old winds howled
5233,THE BRIGHT RIDER,Sick for home.

5236,THE BRIGHT RIDER,"Love, between fear and fear"
5237,THE BRIGHT RIDER,"Riding, and is dumb."
5238,THE BRIGHT RIDER,"The white horse turned to cross the river,"

5255,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER
5256,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5257,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5258,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,When this burning flesh
5259,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Burns down in Time's slow fire to a glowing ash;
5260,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,When these lips have uttered
5261,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"The last word, and the ears' last echoes fluttered;"
5262,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And crumbled these firm bones
5263,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,As in the chemic air soft blackened stones;
5264,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,When all that was mortal made
5265,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Owns its mortality, proud yet afraid;"
5266,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5267,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Then when I stumble in
5268,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"The broad light, from this twilight weak and thin,"
5269,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"What of me will change,"
5270,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,What of that brightness will be new and strange?
5271,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Shall I indeed endure
5272,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"New solitude in that high air and pure,"
5273,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Aching for these fingers
5274,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,On which my assurèd hand now shuts and lingers?
5275,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5276,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Now when I look back
5277,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"On manhood's and on childhood's far-stretched track,"
5278,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,I see but a little child
5279,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,In a green sunny world-home; there enisled
5280,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"By another, cloudy world"
5281,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Of unsailed waters all around him curled,"
5282,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And he at home content
5283,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,With the small sky of wonders over him bent:--
5284,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5285,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Lonely, yet not alone"
5286,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Since all was friendly being all unknown;
5287,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"To-day yesterday forgetting,"
5288,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And never with to-morrow's sorrow fretting;
5289,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Not seeing good from ill
5290,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Since but to breathe and run and sleep was well;
5291,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Asking nor fearing nought
5292,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Since the body's nerves and veins held all his thought....
5293,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5294,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Such a child again shall I
5295,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Stray in some valley of infinity,"
5296,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Where infinite finite seems
5297,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And nothing more immortal than my dreams?
5298,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Where earthly seasons play
5299,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Still with their snows and blossoms and night and day,"
5300,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And no unsetting sun
5301,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Brightens the white cloud and awakes the moon?
5302,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5303,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,In such half-life's half-light
5304,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,To cloak with mortal an immortal sight?
5305,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"With uninformed desire,"
5306,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Shorn passion, gentle mind, contented fire,"
5307,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Ignorant love; to run
5308,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"But with the little journeys of the sun,"
5309,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And at evening sleep
5310,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"With birds and beasts, and stars rocked in the deep?"
5311,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5312,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,But maybe this man's mind
5313,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Will leave not its maturity behind,"
5314,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And nothing will forget
5315,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Of all that teased or eased it here, while yet"
5316,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,A mortal dress it wore;
5317,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And these quick-darting thoughts and probings sore
5318,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,More sharply then will turn;
5319,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And lonelier and yet hungrier the heart burn.
5320,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5321,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"O, I would not forget"
5322,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Earth is too rich, too dark, too sour, too sweet:--"
5323,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Nor be divorcèd quite
5324,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,From the late tingling of the nerves' delight.
5325,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Less I would never be
5326,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Than the deep-graving years have made of me--
5327,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"A memory, pulse, mind,"
5328,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Seed and harvest, a reaper and sower blind."
5329,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5330,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,I shall no more be I
5331,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,If I forget the world's joy and agony;
5332,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,If I forget how strong
5333,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Is the assault of scarce-rebukèd wrong.
5334,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,I shall no more be I
5335,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,If my ears hear not earth's embittered cry
5336,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Perpetual; and forget
5337,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,The unrighteous shackles on man's ankle set;
5338,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5339,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,If no more my heart beat
5340,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Quicker because on earth is something sweet;
5341,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,I shall no more be I
5342,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,If the ancestral voices no more sigh
5343,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Familiar in my brain,"
5344,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"And leave me to cold silence and its pain,"
5345,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And the bewildered stare
5346,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,On an unhomely land in biting air:
5347,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5348,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,If the blood no more vex
5349,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"The heart with the importunities of sex,"
5350,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,If indeed marriage bind
5351,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"No more body to body, mind to mind,"
5352,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"And love be powerless, cold,"
5353,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"That once by love's strength only was controlled,"
5354,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And that chief spiritual force
5355,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Be dam'd back and stretch frozen to its source....
5356,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5357,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"To the Heavenly Power I cry,"
5358,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Foiled by these dreams of immortality,"
5359,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"""Let all be as Thou wilt,"
5360,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,And the foundations in Thy dark mind built;
5361,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Even infinity
5362,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Be but imagination's dream of Thee;
5363,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"And let thought still, still"
5364,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Vainly its waves on night's cliff break and spill.
5365,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,
5366,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"""But, Heavenly Power,"" I'd cry,"
5367,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Knowing how, near or far, He still is nigh,"
5368,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"""When this burning flesh"
5369,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Is burnt away to a little driven ash,"
5370,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,What thing soever shall rise
5371,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"From that cold ash unseen to unseen skies,"
5372,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,Grant that so much of me
5373,TO THE HEAVENLY POWER,"Shall rise as may remember Thy world, and Thee."""

5382,SNOWS,Over the green fields sweeps his cloak and leaves
5383,SNOWS,"Its whiteness there. It caught on the wild trees,"
5384,SNOWS,Shook whiteness on the hedges and left bare
5385,SNOWS,South-sloping corners and south-fronting smooth
5386,SNOWS,Barks of tall beeches swaying 'neath their whiteness
5387,SNOWS,So gently that the whiteness does not fall.
5388,SNOWS,"The ash copse shows all white between gray poles,"
5389,SNOWS,The oaks spread arms to catch the wandering snow.
5390,SNOWS,"But the yews--I wondered to see their dark all white,"
5391,SNOWS,"To see the soft flakes fallen on those grave deeps,"
5392,SNOWS,"Lying there, not burnt up by the yews' slow fire."
5393,SNOWS,"Could Time so whiten all the trembling senses,"
5394,SNOWS,"The youth, the fairness, the all-challenging strength,"
5395,SNOWS,And load even Love's grave deeps with his barren snows?
5396,SNOWS,Even so. And what remains?
5397,SNOWS,The hills of thought
5398,SNOWS,That shape Time's snows and melt them and lift up
5399,SNOWS,Green and unchanging to the wandering stars.

5407,THE THORN,The days of these two years like busy ants
5408,THE THORN,"Have gone, confused and happy and distressed,"
5409,THE THORN,"Rich, yet sad with aching wants,"
5410,THE THORN,"Crowded, yet lonely and unblessed."
5411,THE THORN,
5412,THE THORN,"I stare back as they vanish in a swarm,"
5413,THE THORN,"Seeming how purposeless, how mean and vain,"
5414,THE THORN,Till creeping joy and brief alarm
5415,THE THORN,Are gone and prick me not again.
5416,THE THORN,
5417,THE THORN,"The days are gone, yet still this heart of fire"
5418,THE THORN,"Smouldering, smoulders on with ancient love;"
5419,THE THORN,And the red embers of desire
5420,THE THORN,"I would not, oh, nor dare remove!"
5421,THE THORN,
5422,THE THORN,"Where is the bosom my head rested on,"
5423,THE THORN,"The arms that caught my boy's head, the soft kiss?"
5424,THE THORN,Where is the light of your eyes gone?--
5425,THE THORN,For now I know what darkness is....
5426,THE THORN,
5427,THE THORN,"It is the loneliness, the loneliness,"
5428,THE THORN,Since she that brought me here has left me here
5429,THE THORN,With the sharp need of her to press
5430,THE THORN,Sudden upon the nerve of fear;
5431,THE THORN,
5432,THE THORN,"It is the loneliness that wounds me still,"
5433,THE THORN,"Shut from the generations that are past,"
5434,THE THORN,That with their blood my warm veins fill
5435,THE THORN,And on my spirit their spirit cast;
5436,THE THORN,
5437,THE THORN,That haunt me so and yet how strangely keep
5438,THE THORN,"Beyond communion, alone, alone,"
5439,THE THORN,"Like that huge ancient hill asleep,"
5440,THE THORN,With to-day's noisy winds o'erblown.
5441,THE THORN,
5442,THE THORN,"There from the hill is sprung a single thorn,"
5443,THE THORN,"Wind-twisted, straining from the earth to the skies,"
5444,THE THORN,Thin branches pleading with wild morn
5445,THE THORN,And root that pressed in darkness lies.
5446,THE THORN,
5447,THE THORN,From the unknown of earth and heaven are brought
5448,THE THORN,"Her strength, her weakness, death and bravest life;"
5449,THE THORN,Shadow and light and wind have wrought
5450,THE THORN,"Beauty from change, calm out of strife."
5451,THE THORN,

5453,THE THORN,Alone upon the dark unwhispering hill:--
5454,THE THORN,"You in the stirless cold past lie,"
5455,THE THORN,But I ache warm and lonely still.
5456,THE THORN,
5457,THE THORN,"There's not a storm tossing among my boughs,"
5458,THE THORN,"Nor gentle air drawn under quiet skies,"
5459,THE THORN,There's not an idle cloud that flows
5460,THE THORN,"Across the mind, nor bird that cries,"
5461,THE THORN,
5462,THE THORN,"But says (if I have eyes, or ears to hear),"
5463,THE THORN,"""You in this mortal being are alone."""
5464,THE THORN,And morn and noon and night-stars clear
5465,THE THORN,"Repeat, ""Alone, alone, alone."""
5466,THE THORN,
5467,THE THORN,"Yet the tree in wild storm her dark boughs shakes,"
5468,THE THORN,"Thrusting her roots in the earth, her arms to heaven,"
5469,THE THORN,Fresh washed with dew when morning breaks;
5470,THE THORN,And new light back to the light is given.

5475,THE THORN,Is it that I that looked have yet been blind?
5476,THE THORN,"Longing, have yet remembered not"
5477,THE THORN,Nor heard you whispering in my mind?
5478,THE THORN,
5479,THE THORN,But at a word you are nearer now than when
5480,THE THORN,"We sat and spoke, or merely looked and thought,"
5481,THE THORN,"Knowing all speech superfluous then,"
5482,THE THORN,"Since what we needed, silence brought;--"
5483,THE THORN,
5484,THE THORN,"And your warm bosom my head rested on,"
5485,THE THORN,"The arms that caught my boy's head, the soft kiss,"
5486,THE THORN,The brown grave eyes that gently shone--
5487,THE THORN,"Are here again, and brightness is."
5488,THE THORN,
5489,THE THORN,"Two years have gone, but nearer now are you,"
5490,THE THORN,Being dearer now; and this false loneliness
5491,THE THORN,"Is but a dream that cloudlike grew,"
5492,THE THORN,Then growing cloudlike less and less
5493,THE THORN,
5494,THE THORN,"Passes away, leaving me like the tree"
5495,THE THORN,Bright with the sun and wind and lingering dew;
5496,THE THORN,Homely is all the world for me
5497,THE THORN,Being sweeter with the sense of you.

5528,BEYOND THE BARN,And shadows run
5529,BEYOND THE BARN,Down into hollow woods.

5596,TALK,"Until from this man's gibe and that keen word,"
5597,TALK,"Another's chilly smile or peevish frown,"
5598,TALK,I caught their talk--but added none of mine.
5599,TALK,"They said how she still fumbled with her fate,"
5600,TALK,"How she had banished visitants divine,"
5601,TALK,"How long her sleep had been, her sloth how great,"
5602,TALK,"How others had drawn near and passed her by,"
5603,TALK,"While she luxuriously had dreamed, dreamed on,"
5604,TALK,"She, she her own eternal enemy,"
5605,TALK,"And wanting brain, brain, brain would be undone."
5606,TALK,"The glasses tinkled as they talked and laughed,"
5607,TALK,And if the door a moment hung ajar
5608,TALK,"The noises of the street, remotely soft,"
5609,TALK,Crept in as from a world sunken afar.
5610,TALK,"And still they talked, and then well pleased were pleased"
5611,TALK,"To talk of other things--another's wife,"
5612,TALK,"Money that ministers to a mind diseased,"
5613,TALK,And queer extravagant whims of death and life....
5614,TALK,"But I rose up, flushed at the careless slander,"
5615,TALK,"Heedless what other laughing things were said,"
5616,TALK,And my bruised thoughts began to lift and wander
5617,TALK,"Far off, as from that jargoning I fled."
5618,TALK,"I saw the sharp green hills, the silver clouds"
5619,TALK,"At rest upon the hills, the silver streams"
5620,TALK,Creeping between prone shoulders of dark woods.
5621,TALK,I saw wide marshlands laved with level beams
5622,TALK,Of the last light; I saw ships on the sea
5623,TALK,"That foamed hard by, stinging the fretful shore;"
5624,TALK,I smelt old ships on the deserted quay
5625,TALK,"That English sailors sailed, and will no more;"
5626,TALK,"I thought of men I loved, and of dead men"
5627,TALK,I had longed to know--and each heroic ghost
5628,TALK,"Rose and moved on, and left me alone again"
5629,TALK,Aching for love and splendour glimpsed and lost.
5630,TALK,
5631,TALK,God knows what things I thought when anger broke
5632,TALK,Her narrow dam and swept my spirit clean.
5633,TALK,"Yet I for very shame not a word spoke,"
5634,TALK,"But to my heart's heart caught the things I had seen,"
5635,TALK,"And _England, England!_ murmuring, stood and stared,"
5636,TALK,Swept like a lover with sweet influence

5671,THE UNDYING,But now to see their shapes go lightly by
5672,THE UNDYING,"On those vast fields, clear 'neath the hueless sky,"
5673,THE UNDYING,"With not one furious gesture, and (when seen"
5674,THE UNDYING,With but the broad dark hedgerow space between)
5675,THE UNDYING,"No eye's disdain, no thin drawn face of grief,"
5676,THE UNDYING,But pondering calm or lightened look and brief
5677,THE UNDYING,Smile almost gay;--yet all seen in the air
5678,THE UNDYING,That driv'n mist makes unreal everywhere--
5679,THE UNDYING,"""So strange,"" I breathed, ""How can you English dead"
5680,THE UNDYING,"Forget them for whose life your life was shed?"""
5681,THE UNDYING,
5682,THE UNDYING,"It was no voice that answered, yet plain word"
5683,THE UNDYING,"Less plain is than the unspoken that I heard,"
5684,THE UNDYING,As I lay there on the dry heap of fern
5685,THE UNDYING,"And watched them pass, mix, disappear and return,"
5686,THE UNDYING,And felt their mute speech into empty senses burn:
5687,THE UNDYING,"""Earth's is the strife. The Heavenly Powers that sent"
5688,THE UNDYING,"The gray globe spinning in the firmament,"
5689,THE UNDYING,The Heavenly Powers that soon or late will stay
5690,THE UNDYING,"The spinning, as a child that tires of play,"
5691,THE UNDYING,And globe by spent globe put forgot away
5692,THE UNDYING,In some vast airless hollow: could they see
5693,THE UNDYING,Or seeing endure immortal misery
5694,THE UNDYING,"Made out of mortal, and undying hate"
5695,THE UNDYING,Earth's perishing agonies perpetuate?
5696,THE UNDYING,"O spirits unhappy, if from earth men brought"
5697,THE UNDYING,"The mind's disease, the sickness of mad thought!"
5698,THE UNDYING,Sooner the Heavenly Powers would let them lie
5699,THE UNDYING,Eternally unrising 'neath a sky
5700,THE UNDYING,"Arctic and lonely, where death's starven wind"
5701,THE UNDYING,Raged full-delighted:--sooner would those kind
5702,THE UNDYING,Serenities man's generation cast
5703,THE UNDYING,"Back into nothingness, than heaven should waste"
5704,THE UNDYING,With finite anguish infinitely prolonged
5705,THE UNDYING,Until the Eternal Spring were stained and wronged.
5706,THE UNDYING,"O, even the Heavenly Powers at such a breath"
5707,THE UNDYING,"From mortal shores would fade and fade to death."""
5708,THE UNDYING,
5709,THE UNDYING,"--Was it a voice or but a thought I heard,"
5710,THE UNDYING,"Mine or another's, in my boughs that stirred"
5711,THE UNDYING,Waking the leafy darkness of the mind?
5712,THE UNDYING,"Was it a voice, or but a new-roused wind"
5713,THE UNDYING,"That answered--""O, I know, I know, I know!"
5714,THE UNDYING,The oldest rivers into the full sea flow
5715,THE UNDYING,"And there are lost: so everything is lost,"
5716,THE UNDYING,On midnight waves into oblivion tost.
5717,THE UNDYING,"Yet--the high passion, the pity, the joy and pride,"
5718,THE UNDYING,"The righteousness for which these men have died,"
5719,THE UNDYING,"The courage, the uncounted sacrifice,"
5720,THE UNDYING,"The love and beauty, all that's beyond all price;"
5721,THE UNDYING,"That this, the immortal heart of mortal man,"
5722,THE UNDYING,"Should be--O tell me what, tell me again, again--"
5723,THE UNDYING,Petals lost on the river of the years
5724,THE UNDYING,"When April sweetness pauses, fades and disappears!"
5725,THE UNDYING,That this high Quarrel should be quenched in death
5726,THE UNDYING,As some vexed petty plaint unworthy breath;
5727,THE UNDYING,That the blood and the tears should never rise
5728,THE UNDYING,"Renewed, accusing in grave judgment skies ..."
5729,THE UNDYING,"Tell me again--O, rather tell me not"
5730,THE UNDYING,"Lest that ill telling never be forgot."""
5731,THE UNDYING,
5732,THE UNDYING,And then I rose from that warm ferny heap
5733,THE UNDYING,And my thoughts climbed from the abyss of sleep.
5734,THE UNDYING,"No more in human guise did cloud-shapes pass,"
5735,THE UNDYING,Nor sighed with sad intelligence the grass.
5736,THE UNDYING,"I saw the hueless sky break into blue,"
5737,THE UNDYING,And I remembered how that heaven I knew
5738,THE UNDYING,"When, a small child, I gazed at the great height,"
5739,THE UNDYING,"And thought of nothing but the blue and white,"
5740,THE UNDYING,Pools of sweet blue swimming in fields of light.
5741,THE UNDYING,And as tired men from mine and stithy turn
5742,THE UNDYING,While still the midnight fires unslackened burn
5743,THE UNDYING,"Flushing their road, and so reach home and then"
5744,THE UNDYING,Dream of old childhood's days and dream again;
5745,THE UNDYING,So I forgot those inward fires and found
5746,THE UNDYING,Old happiness like dew lying all around.
5747,THE UNDYING,Under the hedge I stood and far below
5748,THE UNDYING,Saw on the Worcester Plain the swift clouds flow
5749,THE UNDYING,Like ships on seas no greener than the Plain
5750,THE UNDYING,That shone between October sun and rain;
5751,THE UNDYING,And thinking how time's plenteousness would bring
5752,THE UNDYING,"Back and more bright the young delicious Spring,"
5753,THE UNDYING,"Between wet brambles thrust my hand, and tasted"
5754,THE UNDYING,Ripe berries on neglected boughs that wasted.

5762,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Where is that country? The unresting mind
5763,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Like a lapwing nears and leaves it and returns.
5764,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"I know those unknown hill-springs where they rise,"
5765,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,I know the answer of the elms to the wind
5766,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,When the wind on their heaving bosom lies
5767,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,And sleeps. I know the grouping pines that crown
5768,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"The long green hill and fling their darkness down,"
5769,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,A never-dying shadow; and well I know
5770,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,How in the late months the whole wide woodland burns
5771,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"Unsmoking, and the earth hangs still as still."
5772,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"I know the town, the hamlets and the lone"
5773,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Shelterless cottage where the wind's least tone
5774,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"Is magnified, and his far-flung thundering shout"
5775,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Brings near the incredible end of the world. I know!
5776,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Even in sleep-walk I should linger about
5777,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"Those lanes, those streets sure-footed, and by the unfenced stream go,"
5778,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Hearing the swift waters past the locked mill flow.
5779,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"Where is that country? It lies in my mind,"
5780,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Its trees and grassy shape and white-gashed hill
5781,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,And springs and wind and weather; its village stone
5782,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,And solitary stone are in my mind;
5783,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,And every thought familiarly returns
5784,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"To find its home, and birdlike circling still"
5785,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Above the smouldering beeches of November
5786,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,And the bare elms and rattled hedgerows of December.
5787,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,That native country lies deep in my mind
5788,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,For every thought and true affection's home.
5789,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"And like that mental land are you become,"
5790,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"Part of that land, and I the thought that turns"
5791,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Towards home. And as in that familiar land I find
5792,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"Myself among each tree, spring, road and hill,"
5793,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,And at each present step my past footsteps remember;
5794,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"So you in all my inward being lies,"
5795,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"In you my history, my earth and stream and skies."
5796,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,"Your late fire is it that in my boughs yet burns,"
5797,THE NATIVE COUNTRY,Your stone that to my passing footfall cries.

5810,STONE TREES,Last night a sword-light in the sky
5811,STONE TREES,Flashed a swift terror on the dark.
5812,STONE TREES,In that sharp light the fields did lie
5813,STONE TREES,Naked and stone-like; each tree stood
5814,STONE TREES,"Like a tranced woman, bound and stark."
5815,STONE TREES,Far off the wood
5816,STONE TREES,With darkness ridged the riven dark.
5817,STONE TREES,
5818,STONE TREES,"And cows astonished stared with fear,"
5819,STONE TREES,"And sheep crept to the knees of cows,"
5820,STONE TREES,"And conies to their burrows slid,"
5821,STONE TREES,"And rooks were still in rigid boughs,"
5822,STONE TREES,And all things else were still or hid.
5823,STONE TREES,From all the wood
5824,STONE TREES,"Came but the owl's hoot, ghostly, clear."
5825,STONE TREES,
5826,STONE TREES,In that cold trance the earth was held
5827,STONE TREES,"It seemed an age, or time was nought."
5828,STONE TREES,Sure never from that stone-like field
5829,STONE TREES,"Sprang golden corn, nor from those chill"
5830,STONE TREES,Gray granite trees was music wrought.
5831,STONE TREES,In all the wood
5832,STONE TREES,Even the tall poplar hung stone still.
5833,STONE TREES,
5834,STONE TREES,"It seemed an age, or time was none ..."
5835,STONE TREES,Slowly the earth heaved out of sleep
5836,STONE TREES,"And shivered, and the trees of stone"
5837,STONE TREES,"Bent and sighed in the gusty wind,"
5838,STONE TREES,And rain swept as birds flocking sweep.
5839,STONE TREES,Far off the wood
5840,STONE TREES,Rolled the slow thunders on the wind.
5841,STONE TREES,
5842,STONE TREES,"From all the wood came no brave bird,"
5843,STONE TREES,"No song broke through the close-fall'n night,"
5844,STONE TREES,Nor any sound from cowering herd:
5845,STONE TREES,Only a dog's long lonely howl
5846,STONE TREES,When from the window poured pale light.
5847,STONE TREES,And from the wood
5848,STONE TREES,The hoot came ghostly of the owl.

6111,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,It stands there
6112,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Tall and solitary on the edge
6113,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"Of the last hill, green on the green hill."
6114,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"Ten o'clock the tree's called, no one knows why."
6115,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Perhaps it was planted there at ten o'clock
6116,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Or someone was hanged there at ten o'clock--
6117,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"A hundred such good reasons might be found,"
6118,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"But no one knows. It vexed me that none knew,"
6119,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Seeing it miles and miles off and then nearer
6120,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"And nearer yet until, beneath the hill,"
6121,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"I looked up, up, and saw it nodding there,"
6122,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"A single tree upon the sharp-edged hill,"
6123,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Holding its leaves though in the orchard all
6124,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Leaves and fruit were stripped or hung but few
6125,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Red and yellow over the littered grass.
6126,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"--It vexed me, the brave tree and senseless name,"
6127,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,As I went through the valley looking up
6128,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,And then looked round on elm and beech and chestnut
6129,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,And all that lingering flame amid the hedge
6130,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,That marked the miles and miles.
6131,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Then I forgot:
6132,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,For through the apple-orchard's shadow I saw
6133,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Between the dark boughs of the cherry-orchard
6134,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,A great slow fire which Time had lit to burn
6135,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,"The mortal seasons up, and leave bare black"
6136,TEN O'CLOCK AND FOUR O'CLOCK,Unchanging Winter.

6594,RAPTURE,If thou hast grief
6595,RAPTURE,And passion vex the spirit that is in thee--
6596,RAPTURE,
6597,RAPTURE,There was a stony beach
6598,RAPTURE,Where the heat flickered and the little waves
6599,RAPTURE,Whispered each to each.
6600,RAPTURE,"Dove-coloured was that stony beach,"
6601,RAPTURE,And white birds hungering hovered over
6602,RAPTURE,The shining waves;
6603,RAPTURE,And men had kindled there
6604,RAPTURE,A great fierce heap of golden flame--
6605,RAPTURE,Spoiled grasses with dead buttercups and pale clover.
6606,RAPTURE,The agonising flame
6607,RAPTURE,Yearned in its vitals towards the quiet air
6608,RAPTURE,And died in a little smoke.
6609,RAPTURE,And on the coloured beach the black warm ash
6610,RAPTURE,Remained.
6611,RAPTURE,
6612,RAPTURE,Then on that warm ash
6613,RAPTURE,"Another heap of grasses was outpoured,"
6614,RAPTURE,And instant came
6615,RAPTURE,Another knot of struggling yellow smoke
6616,RAPTURE,"That burst into new agonies of flame,"
6617,RAPTURE,Dying into a drift of smoke;
6618,RAPTURE,And on the coloured beach the black cold ash
6619,RAPTURE,Remained.
6620,RAPTURE,
6621,RAPTURE,"Or is thy grief too deep,"
6622,RAPTURE,"Passion too dear, the spirit in thee asleep?--"
6623,RAPTURE,
6624,RAPTURE,"Twelve deep and sombre, still,"
6625,RAPTURE,"Expectant, hushed,"
6626,RAPTURE,The miles-long crowd stood--and then listening.
6627,RAPTURE,"The nervous drums,"
6628,RAPTURE,"The unendurable, low reeds:"
6629,RAPTURE,Silence--and then the nearing drums
6630,RAPTURE,"Again, again the thrilling reeds,"
6631,RAPTURE,And then
6632,RAPTURE,(The deep crowd hushed)
6633,RAPTURE,Following an almightier King
6634,RAPTURE,"That rode unseen,"
6635,RAPTURE,Drew near the tributary magnificence....
6636,RAPTURE,"Hushed, hushed,"
6637,RAPTURE,"The deep crowd stood, devouring, listening;"
6638,RAPTURE,"But a child on his father's shoulder cried,"

6678,MUSIC COMES,Was it the wind in the reeds?
6679,MUSIC COMES,Did the wind range
6680,MUSIC COMES,Over the trembling string;

6754,THE MOUSE,In the quiet house.
6755,THE MOUSE,
6756,THE MOUSE,"Don't you hear it,"
6757,THE MOUSE,That furious mouse?
6758,THE MOUSE,How can you sleep so deep
6759,THE MOUSE,And that noise in the house?
6760,THE MOUSE,Won't you stir
6761,THE MOUSE,At the furious scratching
6762,THE MOUSE,In the cupboard there?
6763,THE MOUSE,
6764,THE MOUSE,No! a sharper sound

6783,HAPPINESS,HAPPINESS
6784,HAPPINESS,
6785,HAPPINESS,
6786,HAPPINESS,I have found happiness who looked not for it.
6787,HAPPINESS,"There was a green fresh hedge,"
6788,HAPPINESS,"And willows by the river side,"
6789,HAPPINESS,And whistling sedge.
6790,HAPPINESS,
6791,HAPPINESS,The heaviness I felt was all around.
6792,HAPPINESS,No joy sang in the wind.
6793,HAPPINESS,"Only dull slow life everywhere,"
6794,HAPPINESS,And in my mind.
6795,HAPPINESS,
6796,HAPPINESS,Then from the sedge a bird cried; and all changed.
6797,HAPPINESS,Heaviness turned to mirth:
6798,HAPPINESS,"The willows the stream's cheek caressed,"
6799,HAPPINESS,The sun the earth.
6800,HAPPINESS,
6801,HAPPINESS,What was it in the bird's song worked such change?
6802,HAPPINESS,The grass was wonderful.
6803,HAPPINESS,I did not dream such beauty was
6804,HAPPINESS,In things so dull.
6805,HAPPINESS,
6806,HAPPINESS,What was it in the bird's song gave the water
6807,HAPPINESS,"That living, sentient look?"
6808,HAPPINESS,Lent the rare brightness to the hedge?
6809,HAPPINESS,That sweetness shook
6810,HAPPINESS,
6811,HAPPINESS,Down on the green path by the running water?
6812,HAPPINESS,Or the small daisies lit
6813,HAPPINESS,With light of the white northern stars
6814,HAPPINESS,In dark skies set?
6815,HAPPINESS,
6816,HAPPINESS,What was it made the whole world marvellous?
6817,HAPPINESS,Mere common things were joys.
6818,HAPPINESS,"The cloud running upon the grass,"
6819,HAPPINESS,"Children's faint noise,"
6820,HAPPINESS,
6821,HAPPINESS,"The trees that grow straight up and stretch wide arms,"
6822,HAPPINESS,"The snow heaped in the skies,"
6823,HAPPINESS,The light falling so simply on all;
6824,HAPPINESS,My lifted eyes
6825,HAPPINESS,
6826,HAPPINESS,That all this startling aching beauty saw?
6827,HAPPINESS,I felt the sharp excess
6828,HAPPINESS,Of joy like the strong sun at noon--
6829,HAPPINESS,Insupportable bliss!

6840,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Pure golden perfect spark;
6841,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6842,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Or sudden wind-bright flame,"
6843,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,That but the strong-handed wind can urge or tame;

6851,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6852,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Sensitive, single"
6853,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Points in the dark inane that purely tingle
6854,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"With eager fire, pouring night's circles through"
6855,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Their living blue;
6856,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6857,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Dark light still waters hold;
6858,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Broad silver moonpath trodden into gold:

6860,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Most comfortable light....
6861,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6862,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"And lovelier, the eye"
6863,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Where light from darkness shines unfathomably,"
6864,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Light secret, clear, shallow, profound, known, strange,"
6865,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Constant alone in change:--
6866,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6867,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Not that wild light that turns
6868,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Hunted from dying eyes when the last fire burns;
6869,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"O, not that bitter light of wounded things,"
6870,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,When bony anguish springs
6871,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6872,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Sudden, intolerable;"
6873,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Nor light of mad eyes gleaming up from hell....
6874,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Come not again, wild light! Shine not again,"
6875,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Hill-flare of pain!
6876,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6877,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"But thou, most holy light...."
6878,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Not the noon blaze that stings, too fiercely bright,"
6879,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Not that unwinking stare of shameless day;
6880,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"But thou, the gray,"
6881,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6882,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Nun-like and silent, still,"
6883,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Fine-breathed on many an eastern bare green hill;
6884,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Keen light of gray eyes, cool rain, and stern spears;"
6885,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Sad light, but not to tears:--"
6886,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,
6887,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"--O, comfort thou of eyes"
6888,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,"Watching expectant from chill northern skies,"
6889,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Excellent joy for lids heavy with night--
6890,COMFORTABLE LIGHT,Strange with delight!

6929,FEAR,
6930,FEAR,"Who knows? for she knew not, but was afraid,"
6931,FEAR,"And then angry with fear,"
6932,FEAR,And then it seemed afraid of all the voices

6934,FEAR,"And then afraid again of that drip, drip"
6935,FEAR,Of water somewhere near.
6936,FEAR,

6938,FEAR,Scream out at hell.

6943,FEAR,Upon the naked anguish of the soul.
6944,FEAR,

6947,FEAR,"Little of terror, little of consciousness,"

6949,FEAR,"Narrowing silences,"

6959,FEAR,Lamps and familiar voices bring.
6960,FEAR,She needs must sing
6961,FEAR,"Now that sharp, spiny agony thrust no more,"
6962,FEAR,"Nor water fell, drip, drip by quivering drip;"

6970,WAKING,
6971,WAKING,
6972,WAKING,Lying beneath a hundred seas of sleep
6973,WAKING,"With all those heavy waves flowing over me,"
6974,WAKING,And I unconscious of the rolling night
6975,WAKING,"Until, slowly, from deep to lesser deep"
6976,WAKING,"Risen, I felt the wandering seas no longer cover me"
6977,WAKING,But only air and light....
6978,WAKING,
6979,WAKING,It was a sleep
6980,WAKING,So dark and so bewilderingly deep
6981,WAKING,"That only death's were deeper or completer,"
6982,WAKING,And none when I awoke stranger or sweeter.
6983,WAKING,"Awake, the strangeness still hung over me"
6984,WAKING,As I with far-strayed senses stared at the light.
6985,WAKING,
6986,WAKING,I--and who was I?
6987,WAKING,"Saw--oh, with what unaccustomed eye!"
6988,WAKING,The room was strange and everything was strange
6989,WAKING,Like a strange room entered by wild moonlight;
6990,WAKING,And yet familiar as the light swept over me
6991,WAKING,And I rose from the night.
6992,WAKING,
6993,WAKING,Strange--yet stranger I.
6994,WAKING,And as one climbs from water up to land
6995,WAKING,"Fumbling for weedy steps with foot and hand,"
6996,WAKING,So I for yesterdays whereon to climb
6997,WAKING,To this remote and new-struck isle of time.
6998,WAKING,But I found not myself nor yesterday--
6999,WAKING,
7000,WAKING,"Until, slowly, from deep to lesser deep"
7001,WAKING,"Risen, I felt the seas no longer over me"
7002,WAKING,But only air and light.
7003,WAKING,"Yes, like one clutching at a ring I heard"
7004,WAKING,"The household noises as they stirred,"
7005,WAKING,And holding fast I wondered. What were they?
7006,WAKING,
7007,WAKING,"I felt a strange hand lying at my side,"
7008,WAKING,Limp and cool. I touched it and knew it mine.
7009,WAKING,"A murmur, and I remembered how the wind died"
7010,WAKING,In the near aspens. Then
7011,WAKING,Strange things were no more strange.
7012,WAKING,I travelled among common thoughts again;
7013,WAKING,
7014,WAKING,And felt the new forged links of that strong chain
7015,WAKING,"That binds me to myself, and this to-day"
7016,WAKING,To yesterday. I heard it rattling near
7017,WAKING,With a no more astonished ear.
7018,WAKING,"And I had lost the strangeness of that sleep,"
7019,WAKING,No more the long night rolled its great seas over me.
7020,WAKING,
7021,WAKING,"--O, too anxious I!"
7022,WAKING,For in this press of things familiar
7023,WAKING,I have lost all that clung
7024,WAKING,Round me awaking of strangeness and such sweetness
7025,WAKING,Nothing now is strange
7026,WAKING,Except the man that woke and then was I.

7905,THE ESCAPE,"Leaves gladly the large, cool"
7906,THE ESCAPE,Night for that serviceable spark;
7907,THE ESCAPE,
7908,THE ESCAPE,And thankful then
7909,THE ESCAPE,"To have 'scaped the peril of the way,"
7910,THE ESCAPE,Turns not his timid steps again
7911,THE ESCAPE,"That night, but waits the common day;--"
7912,THE ESCAPE,
7913,THE ESCAPE,"So I, as weak,"
7914,THE ESCAPE,"Have fled the great hills of Thy love,"
7915,THE ESCAPE,"Too faint to hear what Thou dost speak,"
7916,THE ESCAPE,"Too feeble with fear to look above,"
7917,THE ESCAPE,
7918,THE ESCAPE,And hasten to win
7919,THE ESCAPE,"Some flickering, brief security,"

7964,LAMBOURN TOWN,"The rain beat on me as I walked,"
7965,LAMBOURN TOWN,In the roadside it ran and muttered.
7966,LAMBOURN TOWN,It seemed the rain to the wind talked
7967,LAMBOURN TOWN,Of storm: in the wind the wild cloud fluttered.
7968,LAMBOURN TOWN,
7969,LAMBOURN TOWN,"Across the down, now bleak and loud,"
7970,LAMBOURN TOWN,I went and the rain ran with me.
7971,LAMBOURN TOWN,"How swift the rain, how low the cloud!"
7972,LAMBOURN TOWN,"No heavenly comfort could I see,"
7973,LAMBOURN TOWN,
7974,LAMBOURN TOWN,Nor comfort of low beaming light
7975,LAMBOURN TOWN,From any casement creeping out.
7976,LAMBOURN TOWN,The swift rain on the patient night
7977,LAMBOURN TOWN,"Swept, and anon would great winds shout."
7978,LAMBOURN TOWN,
7979,LAMBOURN TOWN,"Rain, rain, nought else, until I turned"
7980,LAMBOURN TOWN,"The thrusting shoulder of the down,"
7981,LAMBOURN TOWN,And through the mist of rain there burned
7982,LAMBOURN TOWN,The few green lanterns of the town.
7983,LAMBOURN TOWN,
7984,LAMBOURN TOWN,And in the rain the night was lit
7985,LAMBOURN TOWN,With my love's eyes burning for me;
7986,LAMBOURN TOWN,"Her white face in the dark was sweet,"
7987,LAMBOURN TOWN,Her hands like moonflowers quiveringly
7988,LAMBOURN TOWN,
7989,LAMBOURN TOWN,"Fell upon mine, and each was dashed"
7990,LAMBOURN TOWN,"With rain blown in from streaming eaves,"
7991,LAMBOURN TOWN,While overhead the broad flood plashed
7992,LAMBOURN TOWN,Noisily on the broad plane leaves.
7993,LAMBOURN TOWN,
7994,LAMBOURN TOWN,Within we heard the gurgle-glock
7995,LAMBOURN TOWN,"In the pipe, the tip-tap on the sill"
7996,LAMBOURN TOWN,Like the same ticking of the clock;
7997,LAMBOURN TOWN,"We heard the water-butt o'erspill,"
7998,LAMBOURN TOWN,
7999,LAMBOURN TOWN,"The wind come blustering at the door,"
8000,LAMBOURN TOWN,The whipped white lilac thrash the wall;
8001,LAMBOURN TOWN,The candle flame upon the floor
8002,LAMBOURN TOWN,Crept between shadows magical....
8003,LAMBOURN TOWN,
8004,LAMBOURN TOWN,In the black east a pallid ray
8005,LAMBOURN TOWN,Rose high; and sweeping o'er the down
8006,LAMBOURN TOWN,The slow increase of stormless day
8007,LAMBOURN TOWN,Lit the wet roofs of Lambourn town.

8018,THE LAMP,Save when a long sigh crept
8019,THE LAMP,Between her lips.
8020,THE LAMP,
8021,THE LAMP,"Her hair spread dark in that faint light,"

8032,THE LAMP,
8033,THE LAMP,"Sleeping she murmured, stirred and sighed,"

8040,THE LAMP,Her beauty's lamp with cunning fingers.

8170,YOUR SHADOW,
8171,YOUR SHADOW,"Over the wide green downs and bleak,"
8172,YOUR SHADOW,"Unthinking, free I walked,"

8389,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,
8390,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,I heard a voice upon the window beat
8391,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,"And then grow dim, grow still."
8392,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Opening I saw the snowy sill
8393,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Marked with the robin's feet.
8394,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Chill was the air and chill
8395,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,The thoughts that in my bosom beat.
8396,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,
8397,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,I thought of all that wide and hopeless snow
8398,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Crusting the frozen lands.
8399,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Of small birds that in famished bands
8400,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,A-chill and silent grow.
8401,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,And how Earth's myriad hands
8402,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Clutched only hills of frosted snow.
8403,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,
8404,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,And then I thought of Love that beat and cried
8405,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Famishing at my breast;
8406,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,"How I, by chilling care distrest,"
8407,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,"Denied him, and Love died...."
8408,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,"O, with what sore unrest"
8409,I HEARD A VOICE UPON THE WINDOW BEAT,Love's ghost woke with the bird that cried!

8423,I,"""Thou foolish dear, but call not dark this hour;"
8424,I,"What night doth lour?"""
8425,I,"And nought did she reply,"
8426,I,But in her eye
8427,I,"The clamorous trouble spoke, and then was still."
8428,I,
8429,I,"O that I heard her once more speak,"
8430,I,Or even with troubled eye
8431,I,"Teach me her fear, that I might seek"
8432,I,Poppies for misery.
8433,I,"The hour was dark, although I knew it not,"
8434,I,"But when the livid dawn broke then I knew,"
8435,I,How while I slept the dense night through
8436,I,Treachery's worm her fainting fealty slew.
8437,I,
8438,I,O that I heard her once more speak
8439,I,As then--so weak--
8440,I,"""No, no! Leave me not in this dark hour."""

8453,II,By all that's most divine
8454,II,"In your frank human beauty, come and cover"
8455,II,With that deceiving smile the love your lover
8456,II,"Has taught you, and the light that in your eyes"

8466,II,The very sharpness of remembered rapture:--
8467,II,"So it may seem, by exquisite deceit,"
8468,II,"You are yet mine, I yours, and life yet rare and sweet."
8469,II,
8470,II,"Come back--no, come not back now, come back never;"
8471,II,That day you went I knew it was for ever.
8472,II,"I know you, how the spectre of cold shame"
8473,II,Would chill you if you came.
8474,II,"Lo, here first love's first memory abideth;"
8475,II,Here in my heart the image of you yet hideth.
8476,II,"But though you should come back and hope thrilled me anew,"

8487,III,The aspen leaves that sigh
8488,III,"""My dear!"" with your true voice when I pass by...."
8489,III,"O, and that too-long-dying flush of tender sky"
8490,III,"That minds me, and with sense too grave for tears,"
8491,III,Of those forever dead too-blissful years.
8492,III,
8493,III,"Yet 'twere a miracle could I forget you,"
8494,III,"Since even dead things, once sensible of you,"
8495,III,Yield up your ghost; as all the garden through
8496,III,"Murmurs the rose, ""'Twas she"
8497,III,"Shook in her palm the dew that shone in me;"""
8498,III,And on the stairs your recent footstep echoingly
8499,III,"Sounds yet again, and each dark doorway speaks"
8500,III,Of you toward whom my sharpened longing seeks.
8501,III,
8502,III,O that I could forget or not regret you!
8503,III,Could I but see you as I have seen a fair
8504,III,Child under apple-burdened boughs that bear
8505,III,"Morn's autumn beauty, and"
8506,III,"Seeing her saw all heaven at my hand,"
8507,III,And all day long that happy child before me stand....

8615,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Venus, that brushes with her shining lips"
8616,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,(Surely!) the wakeful edge of the world and mocks
8617,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,With hers its all ungentle wantonness?--
8618,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Or the large moon (pricked by the spars of ships
8619,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Creeping and creeping in their restlessness),"
8620,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The moon pouring strange light on things more strange,"
8621,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Looks she unheedfully on seas and lands

8623,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
8624,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"O, not earth trembles, but the stars, the stars!"
8625,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The sky is shaken and the cool air is quivering.
8626,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,I cannot look up to the crowded height
8627,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And see the fair stars trembling in their light,"
8628,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,For thinking of the starlike spirits of men
8629,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Crowding the earth and with great passion quivering:--
8630,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Stars quenched in anger and hate, stars sick with pity."
8631,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,I cannot look up to the naked skies
8632,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Because a sorrow on dark midnight lies,"
8633,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Death, on the living world of sense;"
8634,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Because on my own land a shadow lies

8637,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Streams of uncomprehending sadness pour,"

8639,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars
8640,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"On these magnificent, cruel wars?"
8641,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
8642,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Stars trembled in broad heaven, faint with pity."
8643,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,An hour to dawn I looked. Beside the trees
8644,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Wet mist shaped other trees that branching rose,"
8645,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Covering the woods and putting out the stars.
8646,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"There was no murmur on the seas,"
8647,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,No wind blew--only the wandering air that grows
8648,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"With dawn, then murmurs, sighs,"
8649,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And dies.
8650,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The mist climbed slowly, putting out the stars,"
8651,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And the earth trembled when the stars were gone;
8652,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And moving strangely everywhere upon
8653,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The trembling earth, thickened the watery mist."
8654,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
8655,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And for a time the holy things are veiled.
8656,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,England's wise thoughts are swords; her quiet hours
8657,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Are trodden underfoot like wayside flowers,"
8658,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And every English heart is England's wholly.
8659,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,In starless night
8660,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,A serious passion streams the heaven with light.
8661,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,A common beating is in the air--
8662,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The heart of England throbbing everywhere.
8663,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And all her roads are nerves of noble thought,"
8664,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And all her people's brain is but her brain;
8665,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"And all her history, less her shame,"
8666,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Is part of her requickened consciousness.
8667,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Her courage rises clean again.
8668,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
8669,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Even in victory there hides defeat;
8670,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The spirit's murdered though the body survives,"
8671,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Except the cause for which, a people strives"
8672,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Burn with no covetous, foul heat."
8673,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Fights she against herself who infamously draws
8674,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The sword against man's secret spiritual laws.
8675,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"But thou, England, because a bitter heel"
8676,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Hath sought to bruise the brain, the sensitive will,"
8677,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The conscience of the world,"
8678,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"For this, England, art risen, and shalt fight"
8679,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Purely through long profoundest night,"
8680,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Making their quarrel thine who are grieved like thee;
8681,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,And (if to thee the stars yield victory)
8682,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Tempering their hate of the great foe that hurled
8683,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Vainly her strength against the conscience of the world.
8684,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,
8685,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"I looked again, or dreamed I looked, and saw"

8687,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"The moving mist had gone, and shining still"
8688,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,The moon went high and pale above the hill.
8689,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,Not now those lights were trembling in the vast
8690,THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES,"Ways of the nervy heaven, nor trembled earth:"

8703,SWEET ENGLAND,
8704,SWEET ENGLAND,
8705,SWEET ENGLAND,I heard a boy that climbed up Dover's Hill
8706,SWEET ENGLAND,"Singing _Sweet England_, sweeter for his song."
8707,SWEET ENGLAND,"The notes crept muffled through the copse, but still"
8708,SWEET ENGLAND,"Sharply recalled the things forgotten long,"
8709,SWEET ENGLAND,"The music that my own boy's lips had known,"
8710,SWEET ENGLAND,"Singing, and old airs on a wild flute blown;"
8711,SWEET ENGLAND,
8712,SWEET ENGLAND,"And other hills, more grim and lonely far,"
8713,SWEET ENGLAND,And valleys empty of these orchard trees;
8714,SWEET ENGLAND,"A sheep-pond filled with the moon, a single star"
8715,SWEET ENGLAND,I had watched by night searching the wreckful seas;
8716,SWEET ENGLAND,And all the streets and streets that childhood knew
8717,SWEET ENGLAND,In years when London streets were all my view.
8718,SWEET ENGLAND,
8719,SWEET ENGLAND,"And I remembered how that song I heard,"
8720,SWEET ENGLAND,"_Sweet England_, sung by children on May-day,"
8721,SWEET ENGLAND,Nor any song was sweeter of a bird
8722,SWEET ENGLAND,Than that half-grievous air from children gay--
8723,SWEET ENGLAND,"For then, as now, youth made the sadness bright,"
8724,SWEET ENGLAND,"Till the words, _Sweet, Sweet England_, shone with light."
8725,SWEET ENGLAND,
8726,SWEET ENGLAND,"Now, listening, I forgot how men yet fought"
8727,SWEET ENGLAND,"For this same England, till the song was done"
8728,SWEET ENGLAND,"And no sound lingered but the lark's, that brought"
8729,SWEET ENGLAND,"New music down from fields of cloud and sun,"
8730,SWEET ENGLAND,Or the sad lapwing's over fields of green
8731,SWEET ENGLAND,"Crying beneath the copse, near but unseen."
8732,SWEET ENGLAND,
8733,SWEET ENGLAND,Then I remembered. All wide England spread
8734,SWEET ENGLAND,"Before me, hill and wood and meadow and stream"
8735,SWEET ENGLAND,"And ancient roads and homes of men long dead,"
8736,SWEET ENGLAND,And all the beauty a familiar dream.
8737,SWEET ENGLAND,On the green hills a cloud of silver grey
8738,SWEET ENGLAND,Gave gentle light stranger than light of day.
8739,SWEET ENGLAND,
8740,SWEET ENGLAND,"And clear between the hills, past the near crest"
8741,SWEET ENGLAND,"And many hills, the hungry cities crept,"
8742,SWEET ENGLAND,"Noble and mean, oppressive and oppressed,"
8743,SWEET ENGLAND,Where dreams unrealized of England slept:
8744,SWEET ENGLAND,"And they too England, packed in dusty street"
8745,SWEET ENGLAND,With men that half forgot England was sweet.
8746,SWEET ENGLAND,
8747,SWEET ENGLAND,"Now men were far, but like a living brain"
8748,SWEET ENGLAND,"Quick with their thought, the earth, hills, air and light"
8749,SWEET ENGLAND,Were quivering as though a shining rain
8750,SWEET ENGLAND,Falling all round made even the light more bright;
8751,SWEET ENGLAND,And trees and water and heath and hedge-flowers fair
8752,SWEET ENGLAND,With more than natural sweetness washed the air.
8753,SWEET ENGLAND,
8754,SWEET ENGLAND,"From hill to hill a sparkling web it swung,"
8755,SWEET ENGLAND,"A snare for happiness, lit with lovely dews."
8756,SWEET ENGLAND,The very smoke of cities now was hung
8757,SWEET ENGLAND,But like a grave girl's dress of tranquil hues:
8758,SWEET ENGLAND,"And how (I thought) can England, seen thus bright,"
8759,SWEET ENGLAND,"Lifting her clear frank head, but love the light?--"
8760,SWEET ENGLAND,
8761,SWEET ENGLAND,"No, not her brain! that bright web was the shadow"
8762,SWEET ENGLAND,Of the high spirit in their spirit shining
8763,SWEET ENGLAND,Who on scarred foreign hill and trenchèd meadow
8764,SWEET ENGLAND,"Kept the faith yet, unfearful, unrepining;--"
8765,SWEET ENGLAND,Her faith that with the dark world's liberty
8766,SWEET ENGLAND,Mingles as earth's great rivers with the sea.
8767,SWEET ENGLAND,
8768,SWEET ENGLAND,O with what gilding ray was the land agleam!
8769,SWEET ENGLAND,"It was not sun and dew, bush, bough and leaf,"
8770,SWEET ENGLAND,But human spirits visible as in a dream
8771,SWEET ENGLAND,"That turns from glad to aching, being too brief:"
8772,SWEET ENGLAND,Courage and beauty shining in such brightness
8773,SWEET ENGLAND,That all the thoughtful woods were no more lightless.
8774,SWEET ENGLAND,
8775,SWEET ENGLAND,But most the hills a splendour had put on
8776,SWEET ENGLAND,"Of golden honour, bright and high and calm"
8777,SWEET ENGLAND,And like old heroes young men dream upon
8778,SWEET ENGLAND,When midnight stirs with magic sword and palm;--
8779,SWEET ENGLAND,With the fled mist all meanness put away
8780,SWEET ENGLAND,And the air clear and keen as salt sea-spray....
8781,SWEET ENGLAND,
8782,SWEET ENGLAND,"And yet no dream; no dream! I saw the whole,"
8783,SWEET ENGLAND,"The reap'd fields, idle kine and wandering sheep."
8784,SWEET ENGLAND,"A weak wind through the near tall hedge-tree stole,"
8785,SWEET ENGLAND,And died where Dover's Hill rose bare and steep;
8786,SWEET ENGLAND,"I saw yet what I saw an hour ago,"
8787,SWEET ENGLAND,But knew what save by dreams I did not know--
8788,SWEET ENGLAND,
8789,SWEET ENGLAND,_Sweet England!_--wild proud heart of things unspoken
8790,SWEET ENGLAND,Spirit that men bear shyly and love purely;
8791,SWEET ENGLAND,That dies to live anew a life unbroken
8792,SWEET ENGLAND,As spring from every winter rising surely:
8793,SWEET ENGLAND,"_Sweet England_ unto generations sped,"
8794,SWEET ENGLAND,Now bitter-sweetest for her daily dead.

8807,I,
8808,I,"Then first I knew, seeing that bent grey head,"
8809,I,How England honours all her thousand dead.
8810,I,"Then first I knew how faith through black grief burns,"
8811,I,Until the ruined heart glows while it yearns
8812,I,For one that never more returns--
8813,I,Glows in the spent embers of its pride
8814,I,For one that careless lived and fearless died.
8815,I,"And then I knew, then first,"
8816,I,How everywhere Hope from her prison had burst--
8817,I,"On every hill, wide dale, soft valley's lap,"
8818,I,"In lonely cottage clutch'd between huge downs,"
8819,I,And streets confused with streets in clanging towns--
8820,I,Like spring from winter's jail pouring her sap
8821,I,Into the idle wood of last year's trees.
8822,I,Then first I knew how the vast world-disease
8823,I,"Would die away, and England upon her seas"
8824,I,Shake every scab of sickness; toward new skies
8825,I,"Lifting a little holier her head,"
8826,I,"With honesty the brighter in her eyes,"
8827,I,"And all that urgent horror well forgot,"
8828,I,The dark remembered not;
8829,I,"Only remembered then, with bosom yet hot,"
8830,I,"The blood that on how many a far field lies,"
8831,I,The bones enriching not our English earth
8832,I,That brought them to such splendid birth
8833,I,And the last sacrifice.

8838,II,
8839,II,
8840,II,"Then first I knew, seeing that head bent low,"
8841,II,"How gravely all her days she needs must go,"
8842,II,Bearing an image in her faded breast....
8843,II,
8844,II,"O, the dark unrest"
8845,II,"Of thoughts that never cease their flight,"
8846,II,"Never vanishing, yet never still,"
8847,II,Like birds that wail round the bewildering nest!
8848,II,"But other nestlings never shall be hers,"
8849,II,"Only a painful image his place fill,"
8850,II,Only a memory remain for her thin bosom to nurse
8851,II,In all that dark unrest
8852,II,Of sleepless and tormented night.
8853,II,
8854,II,
8855,II,
8856,III,III
8857,III,
8858,III,
8859,III,Yet from _her_ eyes presage of victory
8860,III,Looked steadfast out at mine.
8861,III,It is not to be thought of (said her eyes)
8862,III,That only a foul blotch the sun may shine
8863,III,"On England, through low poisonous thick skies!"
8864,III,"Never, O never again"
8865,III,"This pain, this pain!"
8866,III,Else from that foreign earth his bones would rise
8867,III,And thrust in anger at the bitter skies.
8868,III,It is not to be thought of that such prayer
8869,III,Should fall unheeded back through heavy air.
8870,III,"But I have heard, in the night I have heard,"
8871,III,"When not a leaf in all the orchard stirred,"
8872,III,"And even the water of the bourne hung still,"
8873,III,"And the old twitching, creaking house was still,"
8874,III,"And all was still,"
8875,III,What was it I heard?
8876,III,"It could not be his voice, come from so far;"
8877,III,I know 'twas not a bird.
8878,III,"It _was_ his voice, or that lone watchful star"
8879,III,"Creeping above the casement bar,"
8880,III,"Saying: Fear thou no ill,"
8881,III,No ill!
8882,III,"Then all the silence was an echoing round,"
8883,III,"The water and dumb trees their antique murmur found,"
8884,III,And clear as music came the repeated Sound:
8885,III,"Fear thou no ill, no ill!"
8886,III,
8887,III,Was it her eyes or her tongue told me this?
8888,III,
8889,III,
8890,III,
8891,IV,IV
8892,IV,
8893,IV,
8894,IV,Yet but sad comfort from such pain is caught....
8895,IV,"I went out from the house and climbed the coombe,"
8896,IV,And where the first light of sweet morning hung
8897,IV,I found the light I sought.
8898,IV,"From somewhere south a bugle's note was flung,"
8899,IV,From somewhere north a sombre boom;
8900,IV,On the opposing hills white flecks and grey
8901,IV,"Spotted the misty green,"
8902,IV,And blue smoke wraiths around the tall trees clung.
8903,IV,Presently rose thick dust clouds from the green:
8904,IV,"Came up, or seemed to come, the instant beat"
8905,IV,Of marching feet;
8906,IV,"Then with the clouds the beating died away,"
8907,IV,And nothing was seen
8908,IV,But broken hills and the new flush of day.
8909,IV,
8910,IV,
8911,IV,
8912,V,V
8913,V,
8914,V,
8915,V,"All round the folding hills were like green waves,"
8916,V,Tossing awhile together ere they fall
8917,V,And fling their salt on the steep stony beach.
8918,V,The sound I heard was sound of Roman feet--
8919,V,"I saw the sparkling light on Roman glaives,"
8920,V,I heard the Roman speech
8921,V,Answering the wild Iberian battle-call:
8922,V,They passed from sight on the long street.
8923,V,And I saw then the Mercian Kings that strode
8924,V,Proudly from the small city of grey stone
8925,V,"And climbed the folding hills,"
8926,V,Past the full springs that bubbled and flowed
8927,V,Through the soft valley and on to Avon stream.
8928,V,They passed--as all things pass and seem
8929,V,"No other than a dream,"
8930,V,All but the shining and the echo gone.
8931,V,But still I listened and looked. Their voice it was
8932,V,Blown through the valley grass;
8933,V,Their dust it was that sprang from the hard road
8934,V,"Where now these English legions flowed,"
8935,V,Waking the quiet like a steady wind.
8936,V,That ancient soldiery before me passed
8937,V,"With all that followed them, and these the last"
8938,V,"Of my own generation, my own mind;"
8939,V,Their strength and courage rooted deep in the earth
8940,V,That brings men to such splendid birth
8941,V,And no vain sacrifice ...
8942,V,"It was as when the land all darkness lies,"
8943,V,"And shades, nor only shades, move freely out"
8944,V,And through the trees are heard and all about
8945,V,"Their ancient ways, 'neath the old stars and skies."
8946,V,So now in morning's light I knew them there
8947,V,"Leading the men that marched and marched away,"
8948,V,"And mounted up the hill, and down the hill"
8949,V,"Passed from my eyes and ears, and left the air"
8950,V,"Trembling everywhere,"
8951,V,And then how still!
8952,V,
8953,V,
8954,V,
8955,VI,VI
8956,VI,
8957,VI,
8958,VI,Then first I knew the joy that yet should be
8959,VI,Ringing from camped hill and guarded sea
8960,VI,With England's victory.
8961,VI,"The dust had stirred, the infinite dust had stirred,"
8962,VI,"It was the courage of the past I heard,"
8963,VI,The virtue of those buried bones again
8964,VI,Animate in these marching Englishmen;
8965,VI,And nothing wanted if the dead but nerved
8966,VI,The living hands that the same England served.
8967,VI,With new-washed eyes I saw as I went down
8968,VI,"On the hill crest the oak-grove's crown,"
8969,VI,With new delighted ear heard the lark sing--
8970,VI,That mad delighted thing;
8971,VI,"The very smoke that rose was strangely blue,"
8972,VI,"But most the orchard brightened wonderfully new,"
8973,VI,"Where the wild spring, ere winter snow well gone,"
8974,VI,"Scattered her whiter, briefer snow-cloud down."
8975,VI,And England lovelier looked than when
8976,VI,Her dead roused not her living men.

8987,THE RETURN,"The unintelligible shock of hosts that still,"
8988,THE RETURN,"Far off, unseeing, strove and strove again:"
8989,THE RETURN,And Beauty flying naked down the hill.
8990,THE RETURN,
8991,THE RETURN,From morn to eve: and then stern night cried Peace!
8992,THE RETURN,And shut the strife in darkness; all was still.
8993,THE RETURN,Then slowly crept a triumph on the dark--
8994,THE RETURN,And I heard Beauty singing up the hill.

9039,HOMECOMING,"In a tall chattering ship,"

9043,HOMECOMING,
9044,HOMECOMING,The tall ship moved how slowly on
9045,HOMECOMING,"With me and hundreds more,"

9047,HOMECOMING,"But of unwhispered, longed-for things,"
9048,HOMECOMING,Familiar things of home.
9049,HOMECOMING,
9050,HOMECOMING,For not in miles seemed other lands
9051,HOMECOMING,"Far off, but in long years"
9052,HOMECOMING,As we came near to England then;
9053,HOMECOMING,Even the tall ship heard secret things
9054,HOMECOMING,As she moved trembling home.
9055,HOMECOMING,
9056,HOMECOMING,It was at dawn. The chattering ship
9057,HOMECOMING,Was strangely hushed; faint mist
9058,HOMECOMING,"Crept everywhere, and we crept on,"
9059,HOMECOMING,And every eye was creeping on
9060,HOMECOMING,"The mist, as we moved home...."
9061,HOMECOMING,
9062,HOMECOMING,"Until we saw, far, very far,"
9063,HOMECOMING,"Or dreamed we saw, her cliffs,"
