100,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,As Easy as A.B.C.
101,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
102,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,(1912)
103,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
104,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"_The A.B.C., that semi-elected, semi-nominated body of a few score"
105,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"persons, controls the Planet. Transportation is Civilisation, our motto"
106,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"runs. Theoretically we do what we please, so long as we do not interfere"
107,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"with the traffic_ and all it implies. _Practically, the A.B.C. confirms"
108,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"or annuls all international arrangements, and, to judge from its last"
109,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"report, finds our tolerant, humorous, lazy little Planet only too ready"
110,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,to shift the whole burden of public administration on its shoulders_.

112,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'With the Night Mail[1].'
113,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
114,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,[Footnote 1: _Actions and Reactions_.]
115,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
116,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Isn't it almost time that our Planet took some interest in the
117,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,proceedings of the AÃ«rial Board of Control? One knows that easy
118,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"communications nowadays, and lack of privacy in the past, have killed"
119,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"all curiosity among mankind, but as the Board's Official Reporter I am"
120,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,bound to tell my tale.
121,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
122,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"At 9.30 A.M., August 26, A.D. 2065, the Board, sitting in London, was"
123,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,informed by De Forest that the District of Northern Illinois had
124,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,riotously cut itself out of all systems and would remain disconnected
125,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,till the Board should take over and administer it direct.
126,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
127,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Every Northern Illinois freight and passenger tower was, he reported,"
128,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"out of action; all District main, local, and guiding lights had been"
129,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"extinguished; all General Communications were dumb, and through traffic"
130,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"had been diverted. No reason had been given, but he gathered"
131,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,unofficially from the Mayor of Chicago that the District complained of
132,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'crowd-making and invasion of privacy.'
133,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
134,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"As a matter of fact, it is of no importance whether Northern Illinois"
135,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"stay in or out of planetary circuit; as a matter of policy, any"
136,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"complaint of invasion of privacy needs immediate investigation, lest"
137,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,worse follow.
138,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
139,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"By 9-45 A.M. De Forest, Dragomiroff (Russia), Takahira (Japan), and"
140,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Pirolo (Italy) were empowered to visit Illinois and 'to take such steps
141,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,as might be necessary for the resumption of traffic and _all that that
142,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"implies.'_ By 10 A.M. the Hall was empty, and the four Members and I"
143,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,were aboard what Pirolo insisted on calling 'my leetle godchild'--that
144,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"is to say, the new _Victor Pirolo_. Our Planet prefers to know Victor"
145,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Pirolo as a gentle, grey-haired enthusiast who spends his time near"
146,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Foggia, inventing or creating new breeds of Spanish-Italian olive-trees;"
147,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,but there is another side to his nature--the manufacture of quaint
148,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"inventions, of which the _Victor Pirolo_ is, perhaps, not the least"
149,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,surprising. She and a few score sister-craft of the same type embody his
150,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,latest ideas. But she is not comfortable. An A.B.C. boat does not take
151,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the air with the level-keeled lift of a liner, but shoots up"
152,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"rocket-fashion like the 'aeroplane' of our ancestors, and makes her"
153,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,height at top-speed from the first. That is why I found myself sitting
154,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"suddenly on the large lap of Eustace Arnott, who commands the A.B.C."
155,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Fleet. One knows vaguely that there is such a thing as a Fleet somewhere
156,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"on the Planet, and that, theoretically, it exists for the purposes of"
157,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"what used to be known as 'war.' Only a week before, while visiting a"
158,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"glacier sanatorium behind Gothaven, I had seen some squadrons making"
159,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,false auroras far to the north while they manoeuvred round the Pole;
160,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"but, naturally, it had never occurred to me that the things could be"
161,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,used in earnest.
162,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
163,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Said Arnott to De Forest as I staggered to a seat on the chart-room
164,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,divan: 'We're tremendously grateful to 'em in Illinois. We've never had
165,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,a chance of exercising all the Fleet together. I've turned in a General
166,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Call, and I expect we'll have at least two hundred keels aloft"
167,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,this evening.'
168,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
169,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Well aloft?' De Forest asked.
170,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
171,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Of course, sir. Out of sight till they're called for.'"
172,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
173,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Arnott laughed as he lolled over the transparent chart-table where the
174,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"map of the summer-blue Atlantic slid along, degree by degree, in exact"
175,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,answer to our progress. Our dial already showed 320 m.p.h. and we were
176,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,two thousand feet above the uppermost traffic lines.
177,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
178,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Now, where is this Illinois District of yours?' said Dragomiroff. 'One"
179,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"travels so much, one sees so little. Oh, I remember! It is in"
180,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,North America.'
181,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
182,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"De Forest, whose business it is to know the out districts, told us that"
183,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"it lay at the foot of Lake Michigan, on a road to nowhere in particular,"
184,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"was about half an hour's run from end to end, and, except in one corner,"
185,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"as flat as the sea. Like most flat countries nowadays, it was heavily"
186,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,guarded against invasion of privacy by forced timber--fifty-foot spruce
187,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"and tamarack, grown in five years. The population was close on two"
188,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"millions, largely migratory between Florida and California, with a"
189,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,backbone of small farms (they call a thousand acres a farm in Illinois)
190,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,whose owners come into Chicago for amusements and society during the
191,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"winter. They were, he said, noticeably kind, quiet folk, but a little"
192,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"exacting, as all flat countries must be, in their notions of privacy."
193,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"There had, for instance, been no printed news-sheet in Illinois for"
194,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,twenty-seven years. Chicago argued that engines for printed news sooner
195,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"or later developed into engines for invasion of privacy, which in turn"
196,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,might bring the old terror of Crowds and blackmail back to the Planet.
197,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,So news-sheets were not.
198,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
199,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'And that's Illinois,' De Forest concluded. 'You see, in the Old Days,"
200,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"she was in the forefront of what they used to call ""progress,"" and"
201,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Chicago--'
202,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
203,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Chicago?' said Takahira. 'That's the little place where there is
204,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Salati's Statue of the Nigger in Flames? A fine bit of old work.'
205,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
206,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'When did you see it?' asked De Forest quickly. 'They only unveil it
207,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,once a year.'
208,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
209,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I know. At Thanksgiving. It was then,' said Takahira, with a shudder."
210,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'And they sang MacDonough's Song, too.'"
211,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
212,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Whew!' De Forest whistled. 'I did not know that! I wish you'd told me
213,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"before. MacDonough's Song may have had its uses when it was composed,"
214,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,but it was an infernal legacy for any man to leave behind.'
215,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
216,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'It's protective instinct, my dear fellows,' said Pirolo, rolling a"
217,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"cigarette. 'The Planet, she has had her dose of popular government. She"
218,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,suffers from inherited agoraphobia. She has no--ah--use for Crowds.'
219,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
220,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Dragomiroff leaned forward to give him a light. 'Certainly,' said the"
221,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"white-bearded Russian, 'the Planet has taken all precautions against"
222,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Crowds for the past hundred years. What is our total population to-day?
223,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Six hundred million, we hope; five hundred, we think; but--but if next"
224,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"year's census shows more than four hundred and fifty, I myself will eat"
225,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,all the extra little babies. We have cut the birth-rate out--right out!
226,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"For a long time we have said to Almighty God, ""Thank You, Sir, but we do"
227,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"not much like Your game of life, so we will not play.""'"
228,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
229,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Anyhow,' said Arnott defiantly, 'men live a century apiece on the"
230,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,average now.'
231,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
232,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, that is quite well! I am rich--you are rich--we are all rich and"
233,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,happy because we are so few and we live so long. Only _I_ think Almighty
234,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,God He will remember what the Planet was like in the time of Crowds and
235,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the Plague. Perhaps He will send us nerves. Eh, Pirolo?'"
236,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
237,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The Italian blinked into space. 'Perhaps,' he said, 'He has sent them"
238,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"already. Anyhow, you cannot argue with the Planet. She does not forget"
239,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the Old Days, and--what can you do?'"
240,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
241,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'For sure we can't remake the world.' De Forest glanced at the map
242,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,flowing smoothly across the table from west to east. 'We ought to be
243,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,over our ground by nine to-night. There won't be much sleep afterwards.'
244,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
245,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"On which hint we dispersed, and I slept till Takahira waked me for"
246,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,dinner. Our ancestors thought nine hours' sleep ample for their little
247,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"lives. We, living thirty years longer, feel ourselves defrauded with"
248,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,less than eleven out of the twenty-four.
249,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
250,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"By ten o'clock we were over Lake Michigan. The west shore was lightless,"
251,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"except for a dull ground-glare at Chicago, and a single"
252,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,traffic-directing light--its leading beam pointing north--at Waukegan on
253,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,our starboard bow. None of the Lake villages gave any sign of life; and
254,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"inland, westward, so far as we could see, blackness lay unbroken on the"
255,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"level earth. We swooped down and skimmed low across the dark, throwing"
256,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,calls county by county. Now and again we picked up the faint glimmer of
257,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"a house-light, or heard the rasp and rend of a cultivator being played"
258,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"across the fields, but Northern Illinois as a whole was one inky,"
259,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"apparently uninhabited, waste of high, forced woods. Only our"
260,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"illuminated map, with its little pointer switching from county to county"
261,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"as we wheeled and twisted, gave us any idea of our position. Our calls,"
262,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"urgent, pleading, coaxing or commanding, through the General"
263,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Communicator brought no answer. Illinois strictly maintained her own
264,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,privacy in the timber which she grew for that purpose.
265,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
266,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, this is absurd!' said De Forest. 'We're like an owl trying to work"
267,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"a wheat-field. Is this Bureau Creek? Let's land, Arnott, and get hold of"
268,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,some one.'
269,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
270,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,We brushed over a belt of forced woodland--fifteen-year-old maple sixty
271,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"feet high--grounded on a private meadow-dock, none too big, where we"
272,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"moored to our own grapnels, and hurried out through the warm dark night"
273,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,towards a light in a verandah. As we neared the garden gate I could have
274,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"sworn we had stepped knee-deep in quicksand, for we could scarcely drag"
275,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,our feet against the prickling currents that clogged them. After five
276,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"paces we stopped, wiping our foreheads, as hopelessly stuck on dry"
277,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,smooth turf as so many cows in a bog.
278,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
279,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Pest!' cried Pirolo angrily. 'We are ground-circuited. And it is my own
280,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,system of ground-circuits too! I know the pull.'
281,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
282,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Good evening,' said a girl's voice from the verandah. 'Oh, I'm sorry!"
283,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,We've locked up. Wait a minute.'
284,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
285,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"We heard the click of a switch, and almost fell forward as the currents"
286,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,round our knees were withdrawn.
287,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
288,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The girl laughed, and laid aside her knitting. An old-fashioned"
289,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Controller stood at her elbow, which she reversed from time to time, and"
290,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,we could hear the snort and clank of the obedient cultivator half a mile
291,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"away, behind the guardian woods."
292,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
293,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Come in and sit down,' she said. 'I'm only playing a plough. Dad's"
294,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,gone to Chicago to--Ah! Then it was _your_ call I heard just now!'
295,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
296,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"She had caught sight of Arnott's Board uniform, leaped to the switch,"
297,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,and turned it full on.
298,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
299,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"We were checked, gasping, waist-deep in current this time, three yards"
300,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,from the verandah.
301,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
302,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'We only want to know what's the matter with Illinois,' said De Forest"
303,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,placidly.
304,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
305,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Then hadn't you better go to Chicago and find out?' she answered.
306,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'There's nothing wrong here. We own ourselves.'
307,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
308,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'How can we go anywhere if you won't loose us?' De Forest went on, while"
309,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Arnott scowled. Admirals of Fleets are still quite human when their
310,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,dignity is touched.
311,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
312,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Stop a minute--you don't know how funny you look!' She put her hands on
313,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,her hips and laughed mercilessly.
314,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
315,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Don't worry about that,' said Arnott, and whistled. A voice answered"
316,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,from the _Victor Pirolo_ in the meadow.
317,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
318,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Only a single-fuse ground-circuit!' Arnott called. 'Sort it out gently,"
319,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,please.'
320,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
321,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,We heard the ping of a breaking lamp; a fuse blew out somewhere in the
322,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"verandah roof, frightening a nestful of birds. The ground-circuit was"
323,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,open. We stooped and rubbed our tingling ankles.
324,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
325,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'How rude--how very rude of you!' the maiden cried.
326,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
327,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"''Sorry, but we haven't time to look funny,' said Arnott. 'We've got to"
328,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"go to Chicago; and if I were you, young lady, I'd go into the cellars"
329,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"for the next two hours, and take mother with me.'"
330,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
331,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Off he strode, with us at his heels, muttering indignantly, till the"
332,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,humour of the thing struck and doubled him up with laughter at the foot
333,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,of the gang-way ladder.
334,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
335,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'The Board hasn't shown what you might call a fat spark on this
336,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"occasion,' said De Forest, wiping his eyes. 'I hope I didn't look as big"
337,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"a fool as you did, Arnott! Hullo! What on earth is that? Dad coming home"
338,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,from Chicago?'
339,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
340,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"There was a rattle and a rush, and a five-plough cultivator, blades in"
341,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"air like so many teeth, trundled itself at us round the edge of the"
342,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"timber, fuming and sparking furiously."
343,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
344,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Jump!' said Arnott, as we bundled ourselves through the none-too-wide"
345,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,door. 'Never mind about shutting it. Up!'
346,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
347,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The _Victor Pirolo_ lifted like a bubble, and the vicious machine shot"
348,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"just underneath us, clawing high as it passed."
349,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
350,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'There's a nice little spit-kitten for you!' said Arnott, dusting his"
351,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,knees. 'We ask her a civil question. First she circuits us and then she
352,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,plays a cultivator at us!'
353,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
354,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'And then we fly,' said Dragomiroff. 'If I were forty years more young,"
355,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,I would go back and kiss her. Ho! Ho!'
356,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
357,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I,' said Pirolo, 'would smack her! My pet ship has been chased by a"
358,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,dirty plough; a--how do you say?--agricultural implement.'
359,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
360,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, that is Illinois all over,' said De Forest. 'They don't content"
361,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"themselves with talking about privacy. They arrange to have it. And now,"
362,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"where's your alleged fleet, Arnott? We must assert ourselves against"
363,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,this wench.'
364,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
365,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Arnott pointed to the black heavens.
366,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
367,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Waiting on--up there,' said he. 'Shall I give them the whole"
368,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"installation, sir?'"
369,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
370,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, I don't think the young lady is quite worth that,' said De Forest."
371,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Get over Chicago, and perhaps we'll see something.'"
372,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
373,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,In a few minutes we were hanging at two thousand feet over an oblong
374,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,block of incandescence in the centre of the little town.
375,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
376,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'That looks like the old City Hall. Yes, there's Salati's Statue in"
377,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"front of it,' said Takahira. 'But what on earth are they doing to the"
378,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,place? I thought they used it for a market nowadays! Drop a
379,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"little, please.'"
380,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
381,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,We could hear the sputter and crackle of road-surfacing machines--the
382,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,cheap Western type which fuse stone and rubbish into lava-like ribbed
383,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,glass for their rough country roads. Three or four surfacers worked on
384,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"each side of a square of ruins. The brick and stone wreckage crumbled,"
385,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"slid forward, and presently spread out into white-hot pools of sticky"
386,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"slag, which the levelling-rods smoothed more or less flat. Already a"
387,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"third of the big block had been so treated, and was cooling to dull red"
388,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,before our astonished eyes.
389,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
390,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'It is the Old Market,' said De Forest. 'Well, there's nothing to"
391,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,prevent Illinois from making a road through a market. It doesn't
392,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"interfere with traffic, that I can see.'"
393,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
394,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Hsh!' said Arnott, gripping me by the shoulder. 'Listen! They're"
395,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,singing. Why on the earth are they singing?'
396,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
397,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,We dropped again till we could see the black fringe of people at the
398,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,edge of that glowing square.
399,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
400,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,At first they only roared against the roar of the surfacers and
401,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,levellers. Then the words came up clearly--the words of the Forbidden
402,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Song that all men knew, and none let pass their lips--poor Pat"
403,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"MacDonough's Song, made in the days of the Crowds and the Plague--every"
404,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,silly word of it loaded to sparking-point with the Planet's inherited
405,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"memories of horror, panic, fear and cruelty. And Chicago--innocent,"
406,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,contented little Chicago--was singing it aloud to the infernal tune that
407,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"carried riot, pestilence and lunacy round our Planet a few"
408,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,generations ago!
409,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
410,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Once there was The People--Terror gave it birth;
411,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Once there was The People, and it made a hell of earth!'"
412,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
413,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,(Then the stamp and pause):
414,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
415,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Earth arose and crushed it. Listen, oh, ye slain!"
416,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Once there was The People--it shall never be again!'
417,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
418,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,The levellers thrust in savagely against the ruins as the song renewed
419,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"itself again, again and again, louder than the crash of the"
420,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,melting walls.
421,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
422,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,De Forest frowned.
423,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
424,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I don't like that,' he said. 'They've broken back to the Old Days!"
425,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,They'll be killing somebody soon. I think we'd better divert
426,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'em, Arnott.'"
427,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
428,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Ay, ay, sir.' Arnott's hand went to his cap, and we heard the hull of"
429,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,the _Victor Pirolo_ ring to the command: 'Lamps! Both watches stand by!
430,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Lamps! Lamps! Lamps!'
431,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
432,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Keep still!' Takahira whispered to me. 'Blinkers, please,"
433,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,quartermaster.'
434,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
435,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'It's all right--all right!' said Pirolo from behind, and to my horror"
436,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,slipped over my head some sort of rubber helmet that locked with a snap.
437,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"I could feel thick colloid bosses before my eyes, but I stood in"
438,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,absolute darkness.
439,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
440,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'To save the sight,' he explained, and pushed me on to the chart-room"
441,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,divan. 'You will see in a minute.'
442,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
443,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"As he spoke I became aware of a thin thread of almost intolerable light,"
444,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,let down from heaven at an immense distance--one vertical hairsbreadth
445,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,of frozen lightning.
446,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
447,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Those are our flanking ships,' said Arnott at my elbow. 'That one is"
448,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,over Galena. Look south--that other one's over Keithburg. Vincennes is
449,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"behind us, and north yonder is Winthrop Woods. The Fleet's in position,"
450,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,sir'--this to De Forest. 'As soon as you give the word.'
451,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
452,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Ah no! No!' cried Dragomiroff at my side. I could feel the old man
453,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"tremble. 'I do not know all that you can do, but be kind! I ask you to"
454,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,be a little kind to them below! This is horrible--horrible!'
455,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
456,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'When a Woman kills a Chicken,"
457,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Dynasties and Empires sicken,'"
458,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
459,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Takahira quoted. 'It is too late to be gentle now.'
460,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
461,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Then take off my helmet! Take off my helmet!' Dragomiroff began
462,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,hysterically.
463,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
464,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Pirolo must have put his arm round him.
465,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
466,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Hush,' he said, 'I am here. It is all right, Ivan, my dear fellow.'"
467,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
468,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I'll just send our little girl in Bureau County a warning,' said"
469,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Arnott. 'She don't deserve it, but we'll allow her a minute or two to"
470,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,take mamma to the cellar.'
471,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
472,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,In the utter hush that followed the growling spark after Arnott had
473,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"linked up his Service Communicator with the invisible Fleet, we heard"
474,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,MacDonough's Song from the city beneath us grow fainter as we rose to
475,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"position. Then I clapped my hand before my mask lenses, for it was as"
476,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,though the floor of Heaven had been riddled and all the inconceivable
477,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,blaze of suns in the making was poured through the manholes.
478,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
479,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'You needn't count,' said Arnott. I had had no thought of such a thing."
480,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'There are two hundred and fifty keels up there, five miles apart. Full"
481,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"power, please, for another twelve seconds.'"
482,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
483,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The firmament, as far as eye could reach, stood on pillars of white"
484,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"fire. One fell on the glowing square at Chicago, and turned it black."
485,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
486,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh! Oh! Oh! Can men be allowed to do such things?' Dragomiroff cried,"
487,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,and fell across our knees.
488,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
489,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Glass of water, please,' said Takahira to a helmeted shape that leaped"
490,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,forward. 'He is a little faint.'
491,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
492,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The lights switched off, and the darkness stunned like an avalanche. We"
493,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,could hear Dragomiroff's teeth on the glass edge.
494,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
495,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Pirolo was comforting him.
496,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
497,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'All right, all ra-ight,' he repeated. 'Come and lie down. Come below"
498,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"and take off your mask. I give you my word, old friend, it is all right."
499,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,They are my siege-lights. Little Victor Pirolo's leetle lights. You know
500,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,_me_! I do not hurt people.'
501,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
502,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Pardon!' Dragomiroff moaned. 'I have never seen Death. I have never
503,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"seen the Board take action. Shall we go down and burn them alive, or is"
504,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,that already done?'
505,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
506,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, hush,' said Pirolo, and I think he rocked him in his arms."
507,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
508,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Do we repeat, sir?' Arnott asked De Forest."
509,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
510,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Give 'em a minute's break,' De Forest replied. 'They may need it.'"
511,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
512,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"We waited a minute, and then MacDonough's Song, broken but defiant, rose"
513,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,from undefeated Chicago.
514,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
515,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'They seem fond of that tune,' said De Forest. 'I should let 'em have"
516,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"it, Arnott.'"
517,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
518,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Very good, sir,' said Arnott, and felt his way to the Communicator"
519,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,keys.
520,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
521,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"No lights broke forth, but the hollow of the skies made herself the"
522,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,mouth for one note that touched the raw fibre of the brain. Men hear
523,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"such sounds in delirium, advancing like tides from horizons beyond the"
524,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,ruled foreshores of space.
525,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
526,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'That's our pitch-pipe,' said Arnott. 'We may be a bit ragged. I've"
527,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,never conducted two hundred and fifty performers before.' He pulled out
528,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the couplers, and struck a full chord on the Service Communicators."
529,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
530,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The beams of light leaped down again, and danced, solemnly and awfully,"
531,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"a stilt-dance, sweeping thirty or forty miles left and right at each"
532,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"stiff-legged kick, while the darkness delivered itself--there is no"
533,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,scale to measure against that utterance--of the tune to which they kept
534,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,time. Certain notes--one learnt to expect them with terror--cut through
535,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"one's marrow, but, after three minutes, thought and emotion passed in"
536,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,indescribable agony.
537,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
538,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"We saw, we heard, but I think we were in some sort swooning. The two"
539,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"hundred and fifty beams shifted, re-formed, straddled and split,"
540,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"narrowed, widened, rippled in ribbons, broke into a thousand white-hot"
541,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"parallel lines, melted and revolved in interwoven rings like"
542,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"old-fashioned engine-turning, flung up to the zenith, made as if to"
543,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"descend and renew the torment, halted at the last instant, twizzled"
544,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"insanely round the horizon, and vanished, to bring back for the"
545,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,hundredth time darkness more shattering than their instantly renewed
546,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"light over all Illinois. Then the tune and lights ceased together, and"
547,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,we heard one single devastating wail that shook all the horizon as a
548,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,rubbed wet finger shakes the rim of a bowl.
549,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
550,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Ah, that is my new siren,' said Pirolo. 'You can break an iceberg in"
551,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"half, if you find the proper pitch. They will whistle by squadrons now."
552,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,It is the wind through pierced shutters in the bows.'
553,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
554,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"I had collapsed beside Dragomiroff, broken and snivelling feebly,"
555,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,because I had been delivered before my time to all the terrors of
556,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Judgment Day, and the Archangels of the Resurrection were hailing me"
557,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,naked across the Universe to the sound of the music of the spheres.
558,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
559,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Then I saw De Forest smacking Arnott's helmet with his open hand. The
560,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"wailing died down in a long shriek as a black shadow swooped past us,"
561,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,and returned to her place above the lower clouds.
562,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
563,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I hate to interrupt a specialist when he's enjoying himself,' said De"
564,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Forest. 'But, as a matter of fact, all Illinois has been asking us to"
565,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,stop for these last fifteen seconds.'
566,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
567,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'What a pity.' Arnott slipped off his mask. 'I wanted you to hear us
568,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,really hum. Our lower C can lift street-paving.'
569,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
570,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'It is Hell--Hell!' cried Dragomiroff, and sobbed aloud."
571,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
572,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Arnott looked away as he answered:
573,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
574,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'It's a few thousand volts ahead of the old shoot-'em-and-sink-'em game,"
575,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"but I should scarcely call it _that_. What shall I tell the Fleet, sir?'"
576,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
577,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Tell 'em we're very pleased and impressed. I don't think they need wait
578,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,on any longer. There isn't a spark left down there.' De Forest pointed.
579,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'They'll be deaf and blind.'
580,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
581,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, I think not, sir. The demonstration lasted less than ten minutes.'"
582,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
583,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Marvellous!' Takahira sighed. 'I should have said it was half a night.
584,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Now, shall we go down and pick up the pieces?'"
585,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
586,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'But first a small drink,' said Pirolo. 'The Board must not arrive"
587,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,weeping at its own works.'
588,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
589,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I am an old fool--an old fool!' Dragomiroff began piteously. 'I did not
590,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,know what would happen. It is all new to me. We reason with them in
591,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Little Russia.'
592,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
593,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Chicago North landing-tower was unlighted, and Arnott worked his ship"
594,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,into the clips by her own lights. As soon as these broke out we heard
595,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,groanings of horror and appeal from many people below.
596,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
597,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'All right,' shouted Arnott into the darkness. 'We aren't beginning"
598,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"again!' We descended by the stairs, to find ourselves knee-deep in a"
599,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"grovelling crowd, some crying that they were blind, others beseeching us"
600,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"not to make any more noises, but the greater part writhing face"
601,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"downward, their hands or their caps before their eyes."
602,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
603,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,It was Pirolo who came to our rescue. He climbed the side of a
604,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"surfacing-machine, and there, gesticulating as though they could see,"
605,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,made oration to those afflicted people of Illinois.
606,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
607,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'You stchewpids!' he began. 'There is nothing to fuss for. Of course,"
608,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,your eyes will smart and be red to-morrow. You will look as if you and
609,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"your wives had drunk too much, but in a little while you will see again"
610,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"as well as before. I tell you this, and I--I am Pirolo. Victor Pirolo!'"
611,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
612,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The crowd with one accord shuddered, for many legends attach to Victor"
613,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Pirolo of Foggia, deep in the secrets of God."
614,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
615,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Pirolo?' An unsteady voice lifted itself. 'Then tell us was there
616,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,anything except light in those lights of yours just now?'
617,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
618,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,The question was repeated from every corner of the darkness.
619,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
620,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Pirolo laughed.
621,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
622,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'No!' he thundered. (Why have small men such large voices?) 'I give you
623,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,my word and the Board's word that there was nothing except light--just
624,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,light! You stchewpids! Your birth-rate is too low already as it is. Some
625,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"day I must invent something to send it up, but send it down--never!'"
626,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
627,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Is that true?--We thought--somebody said--'
628,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
629,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,One could feel the tension relax all round.
630,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
631,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'You too big fools,' Pirolo cried. 'You could have sent us a call and we"
632,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,would have told you.'
633,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
634,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Send you a call!' a deep voice shouted. 'I wish you had been at our end
635,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,of the wire.'
636,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
637,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I'm glad I wasn't,' said De Forest. 'It was bad enough from behind the"
638,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,lamps. Never mind! It's over now. Is there any one here I can talk
639,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,business with? I'm De Forest--for the Board.'
640,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
641,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'You might begin with me, for one--I'm Mayor,' the bass voice replied."
642,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
643,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"A big man rose unsteadily from the street, and staggered towards us"
644,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"where we sat on the broad turf-edging, in front of the garden fences."
645,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
646,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I ought to be the first on my feet. Am I?' said he.
647,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
648,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Yes,' said De Forest, and steadied him as he dropped down beside us."
649,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
650,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Hello, Andy. Is that you?' a voice called."
651,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
652,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Excuse me,' said the Mayor; 'that sounds like my Chief of Police,"
653,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Bluthner!'
654,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
655,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Bluthner it is; and here's Mulligan and Keefe--on their feet.'
656,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
657,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Bring 'em up please, Blut. We're supposed to be the Four in charge of"
658,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"this hamlet. What we says, goes. And, De Forest, what do you say?'"
659,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
660,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Nothing--yet,' De Forest answered, as we made room for the panting,"
661,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,reeling men. '_You've_ cut out of system. Well?'
662,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
663,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Tell the steward to send down drinks, please,' Arnott whispered to an"
664,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,orderly at his side.
665,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
666,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Good!' said the Mayor, smacking his dry lips. 'Now I suppose we can"
667,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"take it, De Forest, that henceforward the Board will administer"
668,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,us direct?'
669,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
670,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Not if the Board can avoid it,' De Forest laughed. 'The A.B.C. is"
671,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,responsible for the planetary traffic only.'
672,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
673,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'_And all that that implies_.' The big Four who ran Chicago chanted
674,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,their Magna Charta like children at school.
675,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
676,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Well, get on,' said De Forest wearily. 'What is your silly trouble"
677,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,anyway?'
678,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
679,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Too much dam' Democracy,' said the Mayor, laying his hand on De"
680,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Forest's knee.
681,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
682,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'So? I thought Illinois had had her dose of that.'
683,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
684,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'She has. That's why. Blut, what did you do with our prisoners last"
685,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,night?'
686,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
687,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Locked 'em in the water-tower to prevent the women killing 'em,' the"
688,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Chief of Police replied. 'I'm too blind to move just yet, but--'"
689,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
690,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Arnott, send some of your people, please, and fetch 'em along,' said De"
691,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Forest.
692,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
693,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'They're triple-circuited,' the Mayor called. 'You'll have to blow out"
694,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"three fuses.' He turned to De Forest, his large outline just visible in"
695,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,the paling darkness. 'I hate to throw any more work on the Board. I'm an
696,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"administrator myself, but we've had a little fuss with our Serviles."
697,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,What? In a big city there's bound to be a few men and women who can't
698,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"live without listening to themselves, and who prefer drinking out of"
699,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,pipes they don't own both ends of. They inhabit flats and hotels all the
700,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"year round. They say it saves 'em trouble. Anyway, it gives 'em more"
701,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,time to make trouble for their neighbours. We call 'em Serviles locally.
702,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,And they are apt to be tuberculous.'
703,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
704,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Just so!' said the man called Mulligan. Transportation is Civilisation.
705,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Democracy is Disease. I've proved it by the blood-test, every time.'"
706,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
707,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Mulligan's our Health Officer, and a one-idea man,' said the Mayor,"
708,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,laughing. 'But it's true that most Serviles haven't much control. They
709,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"_will_ talk; and when people take to talking as a business, anything may"
710,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"arrive--mayn't it, De Forest?'"
711,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
712,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Anything--except the facts of the case,' said De Forest, laughing."
713,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
714,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I'll give you those in a minute,' said the Mayor. 'Our Serviles got to"
715,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"talking--first in their houses and then on the streets, telling men and"
716,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,women how to manage their own affairs. (You can't teach a Servile not to
717,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"finger his neighbour's soul.) That's invasion of privacy, of course, but"
718,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,in Chicago we'll suffer anything sooner than make Crowds. Nobody took
719,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"much notice, and so I let 'em alone. My fault! I was warned there would"
720,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"be trouble, but there hasn't been a Crowd or murder in Illinois for"
721,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,nineteen years.'
722,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
723,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Twenty-two,' said his Chief of Police."
724,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
725,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Likely. Anyway, we'd forgot such things. So, from talking in the houses"
726,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"and on the streets, our Serviles go to calling a meeting at the Old"
727,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Market yonder.' He nodded across the square where the wrecked buildings
728,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,heaved up grey in the dawn-glimmer behind the square-cased statue of The
729,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Negro in Flames. 'There's nothing to prevent any one calling meetings
730,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"except that it's against human nature to stand in a Crowd, besides being"
731,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,bad for the health. I ought to have known by the way our men and women
732,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,attended that first meeting that trouble was brewing. There were as many
733,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"as a thousand in the market-place, touching each other. Touching! Then"
734,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the Serviles turned in all tongue-switches and talked, and we--'"
735,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
736,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'What did they talk about?' said Takahira.
737,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
738,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'First, how badly things were managed in the city. That pleased us"
739,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Four--we were on the platform--because we hoped to catch one or two
740,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,good men for City work. You know how rare executive capacity is. Even if
741,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,we didn't it's--it's refreshing to find any one interested enough in our
742,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"job to damn our eyes. You don't know what it means to work, year in,"
743,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"year out, without a spark of difference with a living soul.'"
744,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
745,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, don't we!' said De Forest. 'There are times on the Board when we'd"
746,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,give our positions if any one would kick us out and take hold of things
747,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,themselves.'
748,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
749,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'But they won't,' said the Mayor ruefully. 'I assure you, sir, we Four"
750,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"have done things in Chicago, in the hope of rousing people, that would"
751,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"have discredited Nero. But what do they say? ""Very good, Andy. Have it"
752,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"your own way. Anything's better than a Crowd. I'll go back to my land."""
753,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"You _can't_ do anything with folk who can go where they please, and"
754,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,don't want anything on God's earth except their own way. There isn't a
755,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,kick or a kicker left on the Planet.'
756,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
757,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Then I suppose that little shed yonder fell down by itself?' said De
758,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Forest. We could see the bare and still smoking ruins, and hear the"
759,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,slag-pools crackle as they hardened and set.
760,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
761,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, that's only amusement. 'Tell you later. As I was saying, our"
762,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Serviles held the meeting, and pretty soon we had to ground-circuit the"
763,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,platform to save 'em from being killed. And that didn't make our people
764,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,any more pacific.'
765,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
766,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'How d'you mean?' I ventured to ask.
767,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
768,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'If you've ever been ground-circuited,' said the Mayor, 'you'll know it"
769,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,don't improve any man's temper to be held up straining against nothing.
770,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"No, sir! Eight or nine hundred folk kept pawing and buzzing like flies"
771,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"in treacle for two hours, while a pack of perfectly safe Serviles"
772,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"invades their mental and spiritual privacy, may be amusing to watch, but"
773,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,they are not pleasant to handle afterwards.'
774,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
775,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Pirolo chuckled.
776,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
777,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Our folk own themselves. They were of opinion things were going too far
778,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,and too fiery. I warned the Serviles; but they're born house-dwellers.
779,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Unless a fact hits 'em on the head they cannot see it. Would you believe
780,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"me, they went on to talk of what they called ""popular government""? They"
781,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,did! They wanted us to go back to the old Voodoo-business of voting with
782,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"papers and wooden boxes, and word-drunk people and printed formulas, and"
783,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,news-sheets! They said they practised it among themselves about what
784,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"they'd have to eat in their flats and hotels. Yes, sir! They stood up"
785,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"behind Bluthner's doubled ground-circuits, and they said that, in this"
786,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"present year of grace, _to_ self-owning men and women, _on_ that very"
787,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,spot! Then they finished'--he lowered his voice cautiously--'by talking
788,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"about ""The People."" And then Bluthner he had to sit up all night in"
789,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,charge of the circuits because he couldn't trust his men to keep
790,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'em shut.'
791,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
792,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'It was trying 'em too high,' the Chief of Police broke in. 'But we"
793,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,couldn't hold the Crowd ground-circuited for ever. I gathered in all the
794,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Serviles on charge of Crowd-making, and put 'em in the water-tower, and"
795,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,then I let things cut loose. I had to! The District lit like a sparked
796,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,gas-tank!'
797,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
798,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'The news was out over seven degrees of country,' the Mayor continued;"
799,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'and when once it's a question of invasion of privacy, good-bye to right"
800,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,and reason in Illinois! They began turning out traffic-lights and
801,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"locking up landing-towers on Thursday night. Friday, they stopped all"
802,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,traffic and asked for the Board to take over. Then they wanted to clean
803,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Chicago off the side of the Lake and rebuild elsewhere--just for a
804,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"souvenir of ""The People"" that the Serviles talked about. I suggested"
805,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"that they should slag the Old Market where the meeting was held, while I"
806,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,turned in a call to you all on the Board. That kept 'em quiet till you
807,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,came along. And--and now _you_ can take hold of the situation.'
808,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
809,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Any chance of their quieting down?' De Forest asked.
810,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
811,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'You can try,' said the Mayor."
812,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
813,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,De Forest raised his voice in the face of the reviving Crowd that had
814,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,edged in towards us. Day was come.
815,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
816,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Don't you think this business can be arranged?' he began. But there was
817,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,a roar of angry voices:
818,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
819,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'We've finished with Crowds! We aren't going back to the Old Days! Take
820,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,us over! Take the Serviles away! Administer direct or we'll kill 'em!
821,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Down with The People!'
822,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
823,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,An attempt was made to begin MacDonough's Song. It got no further than
824,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the first line, for the _Victor Pirolo_ sent down a warning drone on one"
825,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,stopped horn. A wrecked side-wall of the Old Market tottered and fell
826,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,inwards on the slag-pools. None spoke or moved till the last of the dust
827,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"had settled down again, turning the steel case of Salati's Statue"
828,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,ashy grey.
829,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
830,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'You see you'll just _have_ to take us over,' the Mayor whispered."
831,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
832,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,De Forest shrugged his shoulders.
833,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
834,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'You talk as if executive capacity could be snatched out of the air like
835,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,so much horse-power. Can't you manage yourselves on any terms?' he said.
836,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
837,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'We can, if you say so. It will only cost those few lives to begin"
838,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"with,'"
839,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
840,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The Mayor pointed across the square, where Arnott's men guided a"
841,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,stumbling group of ten or twelve men and women to the lake front and
842,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,halted them under the Statue.
843,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
844,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Now I think,' said Takahira under his breath, 'there will be trouble.'"
845,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
846,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,The mass in front of us growled like beasts.
847,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
848,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"At that moment the sun rose clear, and revealed the blinking assembly to"
849,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,itself. As soon as it realized that it was a crowd we saw the shiver of
850,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,horror and mutual repulsion shoot across it precisely as the steely
851,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"flaws shot across the lake outside. Nothing was said, and, being half"
852,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"blind, of course it moved slowly. Yet in less than fifteen minutes most"
853,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,of that vast multitude--three thousand at the lowest count--melted away
854,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,like frost on south eaves. The remnant stretched themselves on the
855,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"grass, where a crowd feels and looks less like a crowd."
856,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
857,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'These mean business,' the Mayor whispered to Takahira. 'There are a"
858,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,goodish few women there who've borne children. I don't like it.'
859,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
860,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,The morning draught off the lake stirred the trees round us with promise
861,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,of a hot day; the sun reflected itself dazzlingly on the canister-shaped
862,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"covering of Salati's Statue; cocks crew in the gardens, and we could"
863,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,hear gate-latches clicking in the distance as people stumblingly
864,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,resought their homes.
865,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
866,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I'm afraid there won't be any morning deliveries,' said De Forest. 'We"
867,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,rather upset things in the country last night.'
868,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
869,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'That makes no odds,' the Mayor returned. 'We're all provisioned for six"
870,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,months. _We_ take no chances.'
871,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
872,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Nor, when you come to think of it, does any one else. It must be"
873,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,three-quarters of a generation since any house or city faced a food
874,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,shortage. Yet is there house or city on the Planet to-day that has not
875,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,half a year's provisions laid in? We are like the shipwrecked seamen in
876,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the old books, who, having once nearly starved to death, ever afterwards"
877,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"hide away bits of food and biscuit. Truly we trust no Crowds, nor system"
878,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,based on Crowds!
879,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
880,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,De Forest waited till the last footstep had died away. Meantime the
881,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"prisoners at the base of the Statue shuffled, posed, and fidgeted, with"
882,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,the shamelessness of quite little children. None of them were more than
883,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"six feet high, and many of them were as grey-haired as the ravaged,"
884,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"harassed heads of old pictures. They huddled together in actual touch,"
885,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"while the crowd, spaced at large intervals, looked at them with"
886,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,congested eyes.
887,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
888,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Suddenly a man among them began to talk. The Mayor had not in the least
889,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,exaggerated. It appeared that our Planet lay sunk in slavery beneath the
890,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,heel of the AÃ«rial Board of Control. The orator urged us to arise in our
891,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"might, burst our prison doors and break our fetters (all his metaphors,"
892,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"by the way, were of the most mediÃ¦val). Next he demanded that every"
893,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"matter of daily life, including most of the physical functions, should"
894,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"be submitted for decision at any time of the week, month, or year to, I"
895,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"gathered, anybody who happened to be passing by or residing within a"
896,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"certain radius, and that everybody should forthwith abandon his concerns"
897,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"to settle the matter, first by crowd-making, next by talking to the"
898,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"crowds made, and lastly by describing crosses on pieces of paper, which"
899,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,rubbish should later be counted with certain mystic ceremonies and
900,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"oaths. Out of this amazing play, he assured us, would automatically"
901,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"arise a higher, nobler, and kinder world, based--he demonstrated this"
902,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,with the awful lucidity of the insane--based on the sanctity of the
903,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Crowd and the villainy of the single person. In conclusion, he called"
904,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,loudly upon God to testify to his personal merits and integrity. When
905,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the flow ceased, I turned bewildered to Takahira, who was"
906,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,nodding solemnly.
907,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
908,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Quite correct,' said he. 'It is all in the old books. He has left"
909,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"nothing out, not even the war-talk.'"
910,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
911,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'But I don't see how this stuff can upset a child, much less a"
912,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"district,' I replied."
913,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
914,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Ah, you are too young,' said Dragomiroff. 'For another thing, you are"
915,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,not a mamma. Please look at the mammas.'
916,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
917,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Ten or fifteen women who remained had separated themselves from the
918,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"silent men, and were drawing in towards the prisoners. It reminded one"
919,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"of the stealthy encircling, before the rush in at the quarry, of wolves"
920,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"round musk-oxen in the North. The prisoners saw, and drew together more"
921,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,closely. The Mayor covered his face with his hands for an instant. De
922,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Forest, bareheaded, stepped forward between the prisoners, and the"
923,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"slowly, stiffly moving line."
924,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
925,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'That's all very interesting,' he said to the dry-lipped orator. 'But"
926,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,the point seems that you've been making crowds and invading privacy.'
927,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
928,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"A woman stepped forward, and would have spoken, but there was a quick"
929,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"assenting murmur from the men, who realised that De Forest was trying to"
930,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,pull the situation down to ground-line.
931,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
932,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Yes! Yes!' they cried. 'We cut out because they made crowds and invaded
933,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,privacy! Stick to that! Keep on that switch! Lift the Serviles out of
934,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,this! The Board's in charge! Hsh!'
935,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
936,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Yes, the Board's in charge,' said De Forest. 'I'll take formal evidence"
937,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"of crowd-making if you like, but the Members of the Board can testify to"
938,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,it. Will that do?'
939,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
940,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The women had closed in another pace, with hands that clenched and"
941,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,unclenched at their sides.
942,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
943,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Good! Good enough!' the men cried. 'We're content. Only take them away
944,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,quickly.'
945,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
946,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Come along up!' said De Forest to the captives, 'Breakfast is quite"
947,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,ready.'
948,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
949,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"It appeared, however, that they did not wish to go. They intended to"
950,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,remain in Chicago and make crowds. They pointed out that De Forest's
951,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,proposal was gross invasion of privacy.
952,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
953,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'My dear fellow,' said Pirolo to the most voluble of the leaders, 'you"
954,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"hurry, or your crowd that can't be wrong will kill you!'"
955,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
956,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'But that would be murder,' answered the believer in crowds; and there"
957,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,was a roar of laughter from all sides that seemed to show the crisis
958,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,had broken.
959,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
960,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"A woman stepped forward from the line of women, laughing, I protest, as"
961,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"merrily as any of the company. One hand, of course, shaded her eyes, the"
962,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,other was at her throat.
963,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
964,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, they needn't be afraid of being killed!' she called."
965,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
966,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Not in the least,' said De Forest. 'But don't you think that, now the"
967,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Board's in charge, you might go home while we get these people away?'"
968,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
969,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I shall be home long before that. It--it has been rather a trying day.'
970,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
971,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"She stood up to her full height, dwarfing even De Forest's"
972,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"six-foot-eight, and smiled, with eyes closed against the fierce light."
973,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
974,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Yes, rather,' said De Forest. 'I'm afraid you feel the glare a little."
975,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,We'll have the ship down.'
976,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
977,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"He motioned to the _Pirolo_ to drop between us and the sun, and at the"
978,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"same time to loop-circuit the prisoners, who were a trifle unsteady. We"
979,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,saw them stiffen to the current where they stood. The woman's voice went
980,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"on, sweet and deep and unshaken:"
981,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
982,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I don't suppose you men realise how much this--this sort of thing means
983,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,to a woman. I've borne three. We women don't want our children given to
984,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Crowds. It must be an inherited instinct. Crowds make trouble. They
985,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"bring back the Old Days. Hate, fear, blackmail, publicity, ""The"
986,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"People""--_That! That! That_!' She pointed to the Statue, and the crowd"
987,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,growled once more.
988,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
989,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Yes, if they are allowed to go on,' said De Forest. 'But this little"
990,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,affair--'
991,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
992,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'It means so much to us women that this--this little affair should never
993,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"happen again. Of course, never's a big word, but one feels so strongly"
994,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,that it is important to stop crowds at the very beginning. Those
995,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,creatures'--she pointed with her left hand at the prisoners swaying like
996,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,seaweed in a tideway as the circuit pulled them--'those people have
997,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,friends and wives and children in the city and elsewhere. One doesn't
998,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"want anything done to _them_, you know. It's terrible to force a human"
999,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,being out of fifty or sixty years of good life. I'm only forty myself.
1000,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"_I_ know. But, at the same time, one feels that an example should be"
1001,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"made, because no price is too heavy to pay if--if these people and _all"
1002,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"that they imply_ can be put an end to. Do you quite understand, or would"
1003,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,you be kind enough to tell your men to take the casing off the Statue?
1004,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,It's worth looking at.'
1005,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1006,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I understand perfectly. But I don't think anybody here wants to see
1007,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,the Statue on an empty stomach. Excuse me one moment.' De Forest called
1008,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"up to the ship, 'A flying loop ready on the port side, if you please.'"
1009,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Then to the woman he said with some crispness, 'You might leave us a"
1010,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,little discretion in the matter.'
1011,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1012,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Oh, of course. Thank you for being so patient. I know my arguments are"
1013,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"silly, but--' She half turned away and went on in a changed voice,"
1014,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Perhaps this will help you to decide.'
1015,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1016,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,She threw out her right arm with a knife in it. Before the blade could
1017,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"be returned to her throat or her bosom it was twitched from her grip,"
1018,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"sparked as it flew out of the shadow of the ship above, and fell"
1019,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,flashing in the sunshine at the foot of the Statue fifty yards away. The
1020,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"outflung arm was arrested, rigid as a bar for an instant, till the"
1021,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,releasing circuit permitted her to bring it slowly to her side. The
1022,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,other women shrank back silent among the men.
1023,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1024,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Pirolo rubbed his hands, and Takahira nodded."
1025,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1026,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'That was clever of you, De Forest,' said he."
1027,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1028,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'What a glorious pose!' Dragomiroff murmured, for the frightened woman"
1029,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,was on the edge of tears.
1030,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1031,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Why did you stop me? I would have done it!' she cried.
1032,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1033,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I have no doubt you would,' said De Forest. 'But we can't waste a life"
1034,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,like yours on these people. I hope the arrest didn't sprain your wrist;
1035,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,it's so hard to regulate a flying loop. But I think you are quite right
1036,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,about those persons' women and children. We'll take them all away with
1037,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,us if you promise not to do anything stupid to yourself.'
1038,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1039,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I promise--I promise.' She controlled herself with an effort. 'But it
1040,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,is so important to us women. We know what it means; and I thought if you
1041,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,saw I was in earnest--'
1042,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1043,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I saw you were, and you've gained your point. I shall take all your"
1044,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Serviles away with me at once. The Mayor will make lists of their
1045,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"friends and families in the city and the district, and he'll ship them"
1046,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,after us this afternoon.'
1047,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1048,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Sure,' said the Mayor, rising to his feet. 'Keefe, if you can see,"
1049,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,hadn't you better finish levelling off the Old Market? It don't look
1050,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"sightly the way it is now, and we shan't use it for crowds any more.'"
1051,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1052,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I think you had better wipe out that Statue as well, Mr. Mayor,' said"
1053,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"De Forest. 'I don't question its merits as a work of art, but I believe"
1054,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,it's a shade morbid.'
1055,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1056,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Certainly, sir. Oh, Keefe! Slag the Nigger before you go on to fuse the"
1057,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Market. I'll get to the Communicators and tell the District that the
1058,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Board is in charge. Are you making any special appointments, sir?'"
1059,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1060,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'None. We haven't men to waste on these back-woods. Carry on as before,"
1061,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"but under the Board. Arnott, run your Serviles aboard, please. Ground"
1062,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,ship and pass them through the bilge-doors. We'll wait till we've
1063,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,finished with this work of art.'
1064,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1065,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"The prisoners trailed past him, talking fluently, but unable to"
1066,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"gesticulate in the drag of the current. Then the surfacers rolled up,"
1067,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,two on each side of the Statue. With one accord the spectators looked
1068,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"elsewhere, but there was no need. Keefe turned on full power, and the"
1069,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,thing simply melted within its case. All I saw was a surge of white-hot
1070,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"metal pouring over the plinth, a glimpse of Salati's inscription, 'To the"
1071,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Eternal Memory of the Justice of the People,' ere the stone base itself"
1072,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,cracked and powdered into finest lime. The crowd cheered.
1073,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1074,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Thank you,' said De Forest; 'but we want our break-fasts, and I expect"
1075,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"you do too. Good-bye, Mr. Mayor! Delighted to see you at any time, but I"
1076,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"hope I shan't have to, officially, for the next thirty years. Good-bye,"
1077,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,madam. Yes. We're all given to nerves nowadays. I suffer from them
1078,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"myself. Good-bye, gentlemen all! You're under the tyrannous heel of the"
1079,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Board from this moment, but if ever you feel like breaking your fetters"
1080,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,you've only to let us know. This is no treat to us. Good luck!'
1081,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1082,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"We embarked amid shouts, and did not check our lift till they had"
1083,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,dwindled into whispers. Then De Forest flung himself on the chart-room
1084,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,divan and mopped his forehead.
1085,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1086,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I don't mind men,' he panted, 'but women are the devil!'"
1087,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1088,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Still the devil,' said Pirolo cheerfully. 'That one would have"
1089,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,suicided.'
1090,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1091,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I know it. That was why I signalled for the flying loop to be clapped
1092,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"on her. I owe you an apology for that, Arnott. I hadn't time to catch"
1093,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"your eye, and you were busy with our caitiffs. By the way, who actually"
1094,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,answered my signal? It was a smart piece of work.'
1095,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1096,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Ilroy,' said Arnott; 'but he overloaded the wave. It may be pretty"
1097,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"gallery-work to knock a knife out of a lady's hand, but didn't you"
1098,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"notice how she rubbed 'em? He scorched her fingers. Slovenly, I"
1099,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,call it.'
1100,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1101,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Far be it from me to interfere with Fleet discipline, but don't be too"
1102,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,hard on the boy. If that woman had killed herself they would have killed
1103,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,every Servile and everything related to a Servile throughout the
1104,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,district by nightfall.'
1105,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1106,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'That was what she was playing for,' Takahira said. 'And with our Fleet"
1107,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,gone we could have done nothing to hold them.'
1108,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1109,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I may be ass enough to walk into a ground-circuit,' said Arnott, 'but I"
1110,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,don't dismiss my Fleet till I'm reasonably sure that trouble is over.
1111,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"They're in position still, and I intend to keep 'em there till the"
1112,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Serviles are shipped out of the district. That last little crowd meant
1113,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"murder, my friends.'"
1114,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1115,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Nerves! All nerves!' said Pirolo. 'You cannot argue with agoraphobia.'
1116,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1117,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'And it is not as if they had seen much dead--or _is_ it?' said
1118,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Takahira.
1119,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1120,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'In all my ninety years I have never seen Death.' Dragomiroff spoke as
1121,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,one who would excuse himself. 'Perhaps that was why--last night--'
1122,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1123,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Then it came out as we sat over breakfast, that, with the exception of"
1124,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Arnott and Pirolo, none of us had ever seen a corpse, or knew in what"
1125,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,manner the spirit passes.
1126,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1127,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'We're a nice lot to flap about governing the Planet,' De Forest"
1128,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"laughed. 'I confess, now it's all over, that my main fear was I mightn't"
1129,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,be able to pull it off without losing a life.'
1130,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1131,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I thought of that too,' said Arnott; 'but there's no death reported,"
1132,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,and I've inquired everywhere. What are we supposed to do with our
1133,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,passengers? I've fed 'em.'
1134,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1135,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'We're between two switches,' De Forest drawled. 'If we drop them in any"
1136,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,place that isn't under the Board the natives will make their presence an
1137,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"excuse for cutting out, same as Illinois did, and forcing the Board to"
1138,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,take over. If we drop them in any place under the Board's control
1139,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,they'll be killed as soon as our backs are turned.'
1140,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1141,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'If you say so,' said Pirolo thoughtfully, 'I can guarantee that they"
1142,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"will become extinct in process of time, quite happily. What is their"
1143,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,birth-rate now?'
1144,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1145,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Go down and ask 'em,' said De Forest."
1146,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1147,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I think they might become nervous and tear me to bits,' the philosopher"
1148,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,of Foggia replied.
1149,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1150,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Not really? Well?'
1151,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1152,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Open the bilge-doors,' said Takahira with a downward jerk of the thumb."
1153,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1154,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Scarcely--after all the trouble we've taken to save 'em,' said De"
1155,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Forest.
1156,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1157,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Try London,' Arnott suggested. 'You could turn Satan himself loose"
1158,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"there, and they'd only ask him to dinner.'"
1159,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1160,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Good man! You've given me an idea. Vincent! Oh, Vincent!' He threw the"
1161,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"General Communicator open so that we could all hear, and in a few"
1162,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"minutes the chart-room filled with the rich, fruity voice of Leopold"
1163,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Vincent, who has purveyed all London her choicest amusements for the"
1164,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"last thirty years. We answered with expectant grins, as though we were"
1165,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"actually in the stalls of, say, the Combination on a first night."
1166,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1167,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'We've picked up something in your line,' De Forest began."
1168,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1169,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'That's good, dear man. If it's old enough. There's nothing to beat the"
1170,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"old things for business purposes. Have you seen _London, Chatham, and"
1171,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Dover_ at Earl's Court? No? I thought I missed you there. Immense! I've
1172,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,had the real steam locomotive engines built from the old designs and the
1173,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"iron rails cast specially by hand. Cloth cushions in the carriages, too!"
1174,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Immense! And paper railway tickets. And Polly Milton.'
1175,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1176,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Polly Milton back again!' said Arnott rapturously. 'Book me two stalls
1177,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"for to-morrow night. What's she singing now, bless her?'"
1178,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1179,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'The old songs. Nothing comes up to the old touch. Listen to this, dear"
1180,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,men.' Vincent carolled with flourishes:
1181,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1182,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Oh, cruel lamps of London,"
1183,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"If tears your light could drown,"
1184,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Your victims' eyes would weep them,"
1185,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Oh, lights of London Town!"
1186,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1187,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Then they weep.'
1188,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1189,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'You see?' Pirolo waved his hands at us. 'The old world always weeped
1190,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"when it saw crowds together. It did not know why, but it weeped. We know"
1191,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"why, but we do not weep, except when we pay to be made to by fat, wicked"
1192,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,old Vincent.'
1193,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1194,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Old, yourself!' Vincent laughed. 'I'm a public benefactor, I keep the"
1195,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,world soft and united.'
1196,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1197,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'And I'm De Forest of the Board,' said De Forest acidly, 'trying to get"
1198,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"a little business done. As I was saying, I've picked up a few people"
1199,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,in Chicago.'
1200,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1201,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I cut out. Chicago is--'
1202,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1203,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Do listen! They're perfectly unique.'
1204,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1205,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Do they build houses of baked mudblocks while you wait--eh? That's an
1206,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,old contact.'
1207,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1208,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'They're an untouched primitive community, with all the old ideas.'"
1209,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1210,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Sewing-machines and maypole-dances? Cooking on coal-gas stoves,"
1211,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"lighting pipes with matches, and driving horses? Gerolstein tried that"
1212,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,last year. An absolute blow-out!'
1213,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1214,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"De Forest plugged him wrathfully, and poured out the story of our doings"
1215,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,for the last twenty-four hours on the top-note.
1216,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1217,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'And they do it _all_ in public,' he concluded. 'You can't stop 'em. The"
1218,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"more public, the better they are pleased. They'll talk for hours--like"
1219,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,you! Now you can come in again!'
1220,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1221,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Do you really mean they know how to vote?' said Vincent. 'Can they act
1222,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,it?'
1223,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1224,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Act? It's their life to 'em! And you never saw such faces! Scarred
1225,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"like volcanoes. Envy, hatred, and malice in plain sight. Wonderfully"
1226,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"flexible voices. They weep, too.'"
1227,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1228,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Aloud? In public?'
1229,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1230,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'I guarantee. Not a spark of shame or reticence in the entire
1231,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,installation. It's the chance of your career.'
1232,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1233,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'D'you say you've brought their voting props along--those papers and
1234,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,ballot-box things?'
1235,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1236,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'No, confound you! I'm not a luggage-lifter. Apply direct to the Mayor"
1237,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,of Chicago. He'll forward you everything. Well?'
1238,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1239,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Wait a minute. Did Chicago want to kill 'em? That 'ud look well on the
1240,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Communicators.'
1241,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1242,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Yes! They were only rescued with difficulty from a howling mob--if you
1243,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,know what that is.'
1244,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1245,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'But I don't,' answered the Great Vincent simply."
1246,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1247,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Well then, they'll tell you themselves. They can make speeches hours"
1248,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,long.'
1249,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1250,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'How many are there?'
1251,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1252,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'By the time we ship 'em all over they'll be perhaps a hundred, counting"
1253,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,children. An old world in miniature. Can't you see it?'
1254,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1255,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'M-yes; but I've got to pay for it if it's a blow-out, dear man.'"
1256,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1257,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'They can sing the old war songs in the streets. They can get
1258,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"word-drunk, and make crowds, and invade privacy in the genuine"
1259,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,old-fashioned way; and they'll do the voting trick as often as you ask
1260,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'em a question.'
1261,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1262,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Too good!' said Vincent.
1263,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1264,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'You unbelieving Jew! I've got a dozen head aboard here. I'll put you
1265,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,through direct. Sample 'em yourself.'
1266,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1267,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,He lifted the switch and we listened. Our passengers on the lower deck
1268,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"at once, but not less than five at a time, explained themselves to"
1269,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Vincent. They had been taken from the bosom of their families, stripped"
1270,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"of their possessions, given food without finger-bowls, and cast into"
1271,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,captivity in a noisome dungeon.
1272,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1273,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'But look here,' said Arnott aghast; 'they're saying what isn't true. My"
1274,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"lower deck isn't noisome, and I saw to the finger-bowls myself.'"
1275,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1276,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'My people talk like that sometimes in Little Russia,' said Dragomiroff."
1277,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'We reason with them. We never kill. No!'
1278,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1279,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'But it's not true,' Arnott insisted. 'What can you do with people who"
1280,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,don't tell facts? They're mad!'
1281,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1282,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Hsh!' said Pirolo, his hand to his ear. 'It is such a little time since"
1283,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,all the Planet told lies.'
1284,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1285,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"We heard Vincent silkily sympathetic. Would they, he asked, repeat their"
1286,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,assertions in public--before a vast public? Only let Vincent give them a
1287,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"chance, and the Planet, they vowed, should ring with their wrongs. Their"
1288,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,aim in life--two women and a man explained it together--was to reform
1289,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the world. Oddly enough, this also had been Vincent's life-dream. He"
1290,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"offered them an arena in which to explain, and by their living example"
1291,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,to raise the Planet to loftier levels. He was eloquent on the moral
1292,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"uplift of a simple, old-world life presented in its entirety to a"
1293,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,deboshed civilisation.
1294,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1295,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Could they--would they--for three months certain, devote themselves"
1296,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"under his auspices, as missionaries, to the elevation of mankind at a"
1297,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"place called Earl's Court, which he said, with some truth, was one of"
1298,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the intellectual centres of the Planet? They thanked him, and demanded"
1299,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,(we could hear his chuckle of delight) time to discuss and to vote on
1300,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"the matter. The vote, solemnly managed by counting heads--one head, one"
1301,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"vote--was favourable. His offer, therefore, was accepted, and they moved"
1302,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,a vote of thanks to him in two speeches--one by what they called the
1303,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'proposer' and the other by the 'seconder.'
1304,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1305,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"Vincent threw over to us, his voice shaking with gratitude:"
1306,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1307,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'I've got 'em! Did you hear those speeches? That's Nature, dear men. Art"
1308,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,can't teach _that._ And they voted as easily as lying. I've never had a
1309,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"troupe of natural liars before. Bless you, dear men! Remember, you're on"
1310,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"my free lists for ever, anywhere--all of you. Oh, Gerolstein will be"
1311,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,sick--sick!'
1312,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1313,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Then you think they'll do?' said De Forest.
1314,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1315,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Do? The Little Village'll go crazy! I'll knock up a series of old-world
1316,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"plays for 'em. Their voices will make you laugh and cry. My God, dear"
1317,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"men, where _do_ you suppose they picked up all their misery from, on"
1318,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"this sweet earth? I'll have a pageant of the world's beginnings, and"
1319,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,Mosenthal shall do the music. I'll--'
1320,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1321,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Go and knock up a village for 'em by to-night. We'll meet you at No. 15
1322,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"West Landing Tower,' said De Forest. 'Remember the rest will be coming"
1323,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,along to-morrow.'
1324,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1325,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,'Let 'em all come!' said Vincent. 'You don't know how hard it is
1326,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"nowadays even for me, to find something that really gets under the"
1327,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,public's damned iridium-plated hide. But I've got it at last. Good-bye!'
1328,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,
1329,A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES,"'Well,' said De Forest when we had finished laughing, 'if any one"

1416,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1417,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,The valley was so choked with fog that one could scarcely see a cow's
1418,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"length across a field. Every blade, twig, bracken-frond, and hoof-print"
1419,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"carried water, and the air was filled with the noise of rushing ditches"
1420,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"and field-drains, all delivering to the brook below. A week's November"
1421,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"rain on water-logged land had gorged her to full flood, and she"
1422,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,proclaimed it aloud.
1423,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1424,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,Two men in sackcloth aprons were considering an untrimmed hedge that ran
1425,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,down the hillside and disappeared into mist beside those roarings. They
1426,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"stood back and took stock of the neglected growth, tapped an elbow of"
1427,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"hedge-oak here, a mossed beech-stub there, swayed a stooled ash back and"
1428,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"forth, and looked at each other."
1429,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1430,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'I reckon she's about two rod thick,' said Jabez the younger, 'an' she"
1431,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"hasn't felt iron since--when has she, Jesse?'"

1433,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Call it twenty-five year, Jabez, an' you won't be far out.'"
1434,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1435,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'Umm!' Jabez rubbed his wet handbill on his wetter coat-sleeve. 'She
1436,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,ain't a hedge. She's all manner o' trees. We'll just about have to--' He
1437,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"paused, as professional etiquette required."
1438,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1439,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'Just about have to side her up an' see what she'll bear. But hadn't we

1441,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1442,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'Get some kind o' line to go by.' Jabez ranged up and down till he found
1443,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"a thinner place, and with clean snicks of the handbill revealed the"
1444,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,original face of the fence. Jesse took over the dripping stuff as it
1445,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"fell forward, and, with a grasp and a kick, made it to lie orderly on"
1446,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,the bank till it should be faggoted.
1447,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1448,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,By noon a length of unclean jungle had turned itself into a cattle-proof
1449,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"barrier, tufted here and there with little plumes of the sacred holly"
1450,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,which no woodman touches without orders.
1451,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1452,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'Now we've a witness-board to go by!' said Jesse at last.
1453,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1454,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'She won't be as easy as this all along,' Jabez answered. 'She'll need"
1455,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,plenty stakes and binders when we come to the brook.'
1456,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1457,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Well, ain't we plenty?' Jesse pointed to the ragged perspective ahead"
1458,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,of them that plunged downhill into the fog. 'I lay there's a cord an' a
1459,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"half o' firewood, let alone faggots, 'fore we get anywheres anigh"
1460,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,the brook.'
1461,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1462,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'The brook's got up a piece since morning,' said Jabez. 'Sounds like's"
1463,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,if she was over Wickenden's door-stones.'
1464,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1465,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"Jesse listened, too. There was a growl in the brook's roar as though she"
1466,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,worried something hard.
1467,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1468,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Yes. She's over Wickenden's door-stones,' he replied. 'Now she'll flood"
1469,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,acrost Alder Bay an' that'll ease her.'
1470,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1471,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'She won't ease Jim Wickenden's hay none if she do,' Jabez grunted. 'I"
1472,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,told Jim he'd set that liddle hay-stack o' his too low down in the
1473,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,medder. I _told_ him so when he was drawin' the bottom for it.'
1474,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1475,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'I told him so, too,' said Jesse. 'I told him 'fore ever you did. I told"
1476,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,him when the County Council tarred the roads up along.' He pointed
1477,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"uphill, where unseen automobiles and road-engines droned past"
1478,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"continually. 'A tarred road, she shoots every drop o' water into a"
1479,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"valley same's a slate roof. 'Tisn't as 'twas in the old days, when the"
1480,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,waters soaked in and soaked out in the way o' nature. It rooshes off
1481,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"they tarred roads all of a lump, and naturally every drop is bound to"
1482,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,descend into the valley. And there's tar roads both two sides this
1483,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,valley for ten mile. That's what I told Jim Wickenden when they tarred
1484,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,the roads last year. But he's a valley-man. He don't hardly ever
1485,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,journey uphill.'
1486,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1487,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'What did he say when you told him that?' Jabez demanded, with a little"
1488,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,change of voice.
1489,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1490,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'Why? What did he say to you when _you_ told him?' was the answer.
1491,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1492,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'What he said to you, I reckon, Jesse.'"
1493,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1494,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Then, you don't need me to say it over again, Jabez.'"
1495,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1496,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Well, let be how 'twill, what was he gettin' _after_ when he said what"
1497,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,he said to me?' Jabez insisted.
1498,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1499,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'I dunno; unless you tell me what manner o' words he said to _you_.'
1500,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1501,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,Jabez drew back from the hedge--all hedges are nests of treachery and
1502,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,eavesdropping--and moved to an open cattle-lodge in the centre of
1503,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,the field.
1504,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1505,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'No need to go ferretin' around,' said Jesse. 'None can't see us here"
1506,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'fore we see them.'
1507,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1508,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'What was Jim Wickenden gettin' at when I said he'd set his stack too
1509,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,near anigh the brook?' Jabez dropped his voice. 'He was in his mind.'
1510,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1511,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'He ain't never been out of it yet to my knowledge,' Jesse drawled, and"
1512,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,uncorked his tea-bottle.
1513,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1514,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'But then Jim says: ""I ain't goin' to shift my stack a yard,"" he says."
1515,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"""The Brook's been good friends to me, and if she be minded,"" he says,"
1516,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"""to take a snatch at my hay, I ain't settin' out to withstand her."""
1517,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"That's what Jim Wickenden says to me last--last June-end 'twas,'"
1518,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,said Jabez.
1519,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1520,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Nor he hasn't shifted his stack, neither,' Jesse replied. 'An' if"
1521,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"there's more rain, the brook she'll shift it for him.'"
1522,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1523,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'No need tell _me_! But I want to know what Jim was gettin' _at_?'
1524,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1525,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,Jabez opened his clasp-knife very deliberately; Jesse as carefully
1526,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"opened his. They unfolded the newspapers that wrapped their dinners,"
1527,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"coiled away and pocketed the string that bound the packages, and sat"
1528,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,down on the edge of the lodge manger. The rain began to fall again
1529,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"through the fog, and the brook's voice rose."
1530,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1531,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,*       *       *       *       *
1532,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1533,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'But I always allowed Mary was his lawful child, like,' said Jabez,"
1534,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,after Jesse had spoken for a while.
1535,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1536,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,''Tain't so.... Jim Wickenden's woman she never made nothing. She come

1541,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1542,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'They was valley-folk,' said Jabez apologetically. 'I'd no call to go in"
1543,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"among 'em, but I always allowed Mary--'"
1544,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1545,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'No. Mary come out o' one o' those Lunnon Childern Societies. After his
1546,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"woman died, Jim got his mother back from his sister over to Peasmarsh,"
1547,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,which she'd gone to house with when Jim married. His mother kept house
1548,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,for Jim after his woman died. They do say 'twas his mother led him on
1549,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"toward adoptin' of Mary--to furnish out the house with a child, like,"
1550,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,and to keep him off of gettin' a noo woman. He mostly done what his
1551,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"mother contrived. 'Cardenly, twixt 'em, they asked for a child from one"
1552,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,o' those Lunnon societies--same as it might ha' been these Barnardo
1553,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"children--an' Mary was sent down to 'em, in a candle-box, I've heard.'"
1554,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1555,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Then Mary is chance-born. I never knowed that,' said Jabez. 'Yet I must"
1556,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,ha' heard it some time or other ...'
1557,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1558,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'No. She ain't. 'Twould ha' been better for some folk if she had been.
1559,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,She come to Jim in a candle-box with all the proper papers--lawful child

1561,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,_And_ there was that Lunnon society's five shillin's a week for her.
1562,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"Jim's mother she wouldn't despise week-end money, but I never heard Jim"

1564,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"no bounds, till it looked at last like they'd forgot she wasn't their"
1565,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"own flesh an' blood. Yes, I reckon they forgot Mary wasn't their'n"
1566,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,by rights.'
1567,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1568,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'That's no new thing,' said Jabez. 'There's more'n one or two in this"
1569,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,parish wouldn't surrender back their Bernarders. You ask Mark Copley an'
1570,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,his woman an' that Bernarder cripple-babe o' theirs.'
1571,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1572,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Maybe they need the five shillin',' Jesse suggested."
1573,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1574,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'It's handy,' said Jabez. 'But the child's more. ""Dada"" he says, an'"
1575,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"""Mumma"" he says, with his great rollin' head-piece all hurdled up in"
1576,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"that iron collar. _He_ won't live long--his backbone's rotten, like. But"
1577,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,they Copleys do just about set store by him--five bob or no five bob.'
1578,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1579,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Same way with Jim an' his mother,' Jesse went on. 'There was talk"
1580,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,betwixt 'em after a few years o' not takin' any more week-end money for
1581,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,Mary; but let alone _she_ never passed a farden in the mire 'thout
1582,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"longin's, Jim didn't care, like, to push himself forward into the"
1583,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,Society's remembrance. So naun came of it. The week-end money would ha'
1584,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,made no odds to Jim--not after his uncle willed him they four cottages
1585,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,at Eastbourne _an'_ money in the bank.'
1586,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1587,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'That was true, too, then? I heard something in a scadderin'"
1588,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"word-o'-mouth way,' said Jabez."
1589,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1590,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'I'll answer for the house property, because Jim he requested my signed"
1591,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,name at the foot o' some papers concernin' it. Regardin' the money in
1592,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"the bank, he nature-ally wouldn't like such things talked about all"
1593,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"round the parish, so he took strangers for witnesses.'"
1594,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1595,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'Then 'twill make Mary worth seekin' after?'
1596,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1597,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'She'll need it. Her Maker ain't done much for her outside nor yet in.'
1598,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1599,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'That ain't no odds.' Jabez shook his head till the water showered off
1600,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"his hat-brim. 'If Mary has money, she'll be wed before any likely pore"
1601,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,maid. She's cause to be grateful to Jim.'
1602,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1603,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'She hides it middlin' close, then,' said Jesse. 'It don't sometimes"
1604,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,look to me as if Mary has her natural rightful feelin's. She don't put
1605,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,on an apron o' Mondays 'thout being druv to it--in the kitchen _or_ the

1607,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,I never knowed her show any sort o' kindness to nobody--not even when
1608,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,Jim's mother was took dumb. No! 'Twadn't no stroke. It stifled the old
1609,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,lady in the throat here. First she couldn't shape her words no shape;
1610,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"then she clucked, like, an' lastly she couldn't more than suck down"
1611,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"spoon-meat an' hold her peace. Jim took her to Doctor Harding, an'"
1612,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"Harding he bundled her off to Brighton Hospital on a ticket, but they"
1613,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,couldn't make no stay to her afflictions there; and she was bundled off
1614,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"to Lunnon, an' they lit a great old lamp inside her, and Jim told me"
1615,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"they couldn't make out nothing in no sort there; and, along o' one thing"
1616,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"an' another, an' all their spyin's and pryin's, she come back a hem"
1617,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,sight worse than when she started. Jim said he'd have no more
1618,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"hospitalizin', so he give her a slate, which she tied to her"
1619,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"waist-string, and what she was minded to say she writ on it.'"
1620,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1621,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Now, I never knowed that! But they're valley-folk,' Jabez repeated."
1622,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1623,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"''Twadn't particular noticeable, for she wasn't a talkin' woman any time"

1634,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"wasn't drunk--only a little concerned in liquor, like--an' his back was"
1635,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,a mask where he'd slipped in the muck comin' along. He went up the
1636,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"bricks past Jim's mother, which was feedin' the ducks, an' set himself"
1637,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,down at the table inside--Jim was just changin' his socks--an' the man
1638,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,let Jim know all his rights and aims regardin' Mary. Then there just
1639,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"about _was_ a hurly-bulloo? Jim's fust mind was to pitch him forth, but"
1640,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"he'd done that once in his young days, and got six months up to Lewes"
1641,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,jail along o' the man fallin' on his head. So he swallowed his spittle
1642,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,an' let him talk. The law about Mary _was_ on the man's side from fust
1643,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"to last, for he showed us all the papers. Then Mary come"
1644,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,downstairs--she'd been studyin' for an examination--an' the man tells
1645,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"her who he was, an' she says he had ought to have took proper care of"
1646,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"his own flesh and blood while he had it by him, an' not to think he"
1647,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"could ree-claim it when it suited. He says somethin' or other, but she"
1648,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"looks him up an' down, front an' backwent, an' she just tongues him"
1649,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"scadderin' out o' doors, and he went away stuffin' all the papers back"
1650,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"into his hat, talkin' most abusefully. Then she come back an' freed her"
1651,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,mind against Jim an' his mother for not havin' warned her of her
1652,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"upbringin's, which it come out she hadn't ever been told. They didn't"
1653,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,say naun to her. They never did. _I'd_ ha' packed her off with any man
1654,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,that would ha' took her--an' God's pity on him!'
1655,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1656,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Umm!' said Jabez, and sucked his pipe."
1657,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1658,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'So then, that was the beginnin.' The man come back again next week or"
1659,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"so, an' he catched Jim alone, 'thout his mother this time, an' he fair"
1660,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,beazled him with his papers an' his talk--for the law _was_ on his
1661,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,side--till Jim went down into his money-purse an' give him ten shillings
1662,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,hush-money--he told me--to withdraw away for a bit an' leave Mary
1663,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,with 'em.'
1664,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1665,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'But that's no way to get rid o' man or woman,' Jabez said."
1666,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1667,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'No more 'tis. I told Jim so. ""What can I do?"" Jim says. ""The law's"
1668,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,_with_ the man. I walk about daytimes thinkin' o' it till I sweats my
1669,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"underclothes wringin', an' I lie abed nights thinkin' o' it till I"
1670,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"sweats my sheets all of a sop. 'Tisn't as if I was a young man,"" he"
1671,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"says, ""nor yet as if I was a pore man. Maybe he'll drink hisself to"
1672,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"death."" I e'en a'most told him outright what foolishness he was enterin'"
1673,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"into, but he knowed it--he knowed it--because he said next time the man"
1674,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,come 'twould be fifteen shillin's. An' next time 'twas. Just fifteen
1675,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,shillin's!'
1676,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1677,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'An' _was_ the man her father?' asked Jabez.
1678,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1679,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'He had the proofs an' the papers. Jim showed me what that Lunnon
1680,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,Childern's Society had answered when Mary writ up to 'em an' taxed 'em
1681,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"with it. I lay she hadn't been proper polite in her letters to 'em, for"
1682,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,they answered middlin' short. They said the matter was out o' their
1683,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"hands, but--let's see if I remember--oh, yes,--they ree-gretted there"
1684,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,had been an oversight. I reckon they had sent Mary out in the candle-box
1685,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"as a orphan instead o' havin' a father. Terrible awkward! Then, when"
1686,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"he'd drinked up the money, the man come again--in his usuals--an' he"
1687,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"kept hammerin' on and hammerin' on about his duty to his pore dear wife,"
1688,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"an' what he'd do for his dear daughter in Lunnon, till the tears runned"
1689,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,down his two dirty cheeks an' he come away with more money. Jim used to
1690,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,slip it into his hand behind the door; but his mother she heard the
1691,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,chink. She didn't hold with hush-money. She'd write out all her feelin's
1692,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"on the slate, an' Jim 'ud be settin' up half the night answerin' back"
1693,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,an' showing that the man had the law with him.'
1694,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1695,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Hadn't that man no trade nor business, then?'"
1696,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1697,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'He told me he was a printer. I reckon, though, he lived on the rates"
1698,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,like the rest of 'em up there in Lunnon.'
1699,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1700,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'An' how did Mary take it?'
1701,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1702,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,'She said she'd sooner go into service than go with the man. I reckon a
1703,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,mistress 'ud be middlin' put to it for a maid 'fore she put Mary into
1704,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,cap an' gown. She was studyin' to be a schoo-ool-teacher. A beauty

1706,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,father kep' comin' an' comin' 'carden as he'd drinked out the money Jim

1709,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"to write her feelin's on the slate instead o' givin' 'em vent by mouth,"
1710,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,she was just about mad. Just about she _was_ mad!

1712,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Come November, I lodged with Jim in the outside room over 'gainst his"
1713,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,hen-house. I paid _her_ my rent. I was workin' for Dockett at

1715,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,this be--rain atop o' rain after a wet October. (An' I remember it ended
1716,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,in dry frostes right away up to Christmas.) Dockett he'd sent up to
1717,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"Perry Shaw for me--no, he comes puffin' up to me himself--because a big"
1718,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,corner-piece o' the bank had slipped into the brook where she makes that

1721,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"they'd slipped with the slip, an' the brook was comin' rooshin' down"
1722,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"atop of 'em, an' they'd just about back an' spill the waters over his"

1730,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,
1731,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"'Yes. I reckon I had ought to have drove my bargain, but the brook was"
1732,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,"backin' up on good bread-corn. So 'cardenly, I laid into the mess of it,"

1764,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,pullin' what we could get to o' the rubbish. There was a middlin' lot

1766,MACDONOUGH'S SONG,all poltin' down together; but they rooshed round the elber good shape

1903,THE LAND,"When Julius Fabricius, Sub-Prefect of the Weald,"
1904,THE LAND,"In the days of Diocletian owned our Lower River-field,"
1905,THE LAND,"He called to him Hobdenius--a Briton of the Clay,"
1906,THE LAND,Saying: 'What about that River-piece for layin' in to hay?'
1907,THE LAND,
1908,THE LAND,And the aged Hobden answered: 'I remember as a lad
1909,THE LAND,My father told your father that she wanted dreenin' bad.
1910,THE LAND,An' the more that you neeglect her the less you'll get her clean.
1911,THE LAND,"Have it jest _as_ you've a mind to, but, if I was you, I'd dreen.'"
1912,THE LAND,
1913,THE LAND,So they drained it long and crossways in the lavish Roman style.
1914,THE LAND,"Still we find among the river-drift their flakes of ancient tile,"
1915,THE LAND,"And in drouthy middle August, when the bones of meadows show,"
1916,THE LAND,We can trace the lines they followed sixteen hundred years ago.
1917,THE LAND,
1918,THE LAND,"Then Julius Fabricius died as even Prefects do,"
1919,THE LAND,"And after certain centuries, Imperial Rome died too."
1920,THE LAND,Then did robbers enter Britain from across the Northern main
1921,THE LAND,And our Lower River-field was won by Ogier the Dane.
1922,THE LAND,
1923,THE LAND,Well could Ogier work his war-boat--well could Ogier wield
1924,THE LAND,his brand--
1925,THE LAND,Much he knew of foaming waters--not so much of farming land.
1926,THE LAND,So he called to him a Hobden of the old unaltered blood.
1927,THE LAND,"Saying: 'What about that River-bit, she doesn't look no good?'"
1928,THE LAND,
1929,THE LAND,"And that aged Hobden answered: ''Tain't for _me_ to interfere,"
1930,THE LAND,But I've known that bit o' meadow now for five and fifty year.
1931,THE LAND,"Have it _jest_ as you've a mind to, but I've proved it time"
1932,THE LAND,"on time,"
1933,THE LAND,If you want to change her nature you have _got_ to give her lime!'
1934,THE LAND,
1935,THE LAND,"Ogier sent his wains to Lewes, twenty hours' solemn walk,"
1936,THE LAND,"And drew back great abundance of the cool, grey, healing chalk."
1937,THE LAND,"And old Hobden spread it broadcast, never heeding what was in't;"
1938,THE LAND,"Which is why in cleaning ditches, now and then we find a flint."
1939,THE LAND,
1940,THE LAND,"Ogier died. His sons grew English. Anglo-Saxon was their name,"
1941,THE LAND,Till out of blossomed Normandy another pirate came;
1942,THE LAND,"For Duke William conquered England and divided with his men,"
1943,THE LAND,And our Lower River-field he gave to William of Warenne.
1944,THE LAND,
1945,THE LAND,But the Brook (you know her habit) rose one rainy Autumn night
1946,THE LAND,And tore down sodden flitches of the bank to left and right.
1947,THE LAND,"So, said William to his Bailiff as they rode their dripping rounds:"
1948,THE LAND,"'Hob, what about that River-bit--the Brook's got up no bounds?'"
1949,THE LAND,
1950,THE LAND,"And that aged Hobden answered: ''Tain't my business to advise,"
1951,THE LAND,But ye might ha' known 'twould happen from the way the valley lies.
1952,THE LAND,When ye can't hold back the water you must try and save the sile.
1953,THE LAND,"Hev it jest as you've a _mind_ to, but, if I was you, I'd spile!'"
1954,THE LAND,
1955,THE LAND,They spiled along the water-course with trunks of willow-trees
1956,THE LAND,And planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees.
1957,THE LAND,And when the spates of Autumn whirl the gravel-beds away
1958,THE LAND,You can see their faithful fragments iron-hard in iron clay.

1986,THE LAND,
1987,THE LAND,"'Hob, what about that River-bit?' I turn to him again"

2000,THE LAND,
2001,THE LAND,'Then how do you account for my knowing when the thing is due?' Conroy's
2002,THE LAND,voice rose almost to a break.
2003,THE LAND,
2004,THE LAND,"'Of course, but you should have consulted a doctor before"
2005,THE LAND,using--palliatives.'
2006,THE LAND,
2007,THE LAND,'It was driving me mad. And now I can't give them up.'
2008,THE LAND,
2009,THE LAND,''Not so bad as that! One doesn't form fatal habits at twenty-five.
2010,THE LAND,Think again. Were you ever frightened as a child?'
2011,THE LAND,
2012,THE LAND,'I don't remember. It began when I was a boy.'
2013,THE LAND,
2014,THE LAND,"'With or without the spasm? By the way, do you mind describing the spasm"
2015,THE LAND,again?'
2016,THE LAND,
2017,THE LAND,"'Well,' said Conroy, twisting in the chair, 'I'm no musician, but"
2018,THE LAND,suppose you were a violin-string--vibrating--and some one put his finger
2019,THE LAND,on you? As if a finger were put on the naked soul! Awful!'
2020,THE LAND,
2021,THE LAND,'So's indigestion--so's nightmare--while it lasts.'
2022,THE LAND,
2023,THE LAND,'But the horror afterwards knocks me out for days. And the waiting for
2024,THE LAND,"it ... and then this drug habit! It can't go on!' He shook as he spoke,"
2025,THE LAND,and the chair creaked.
2026,THE LAND,
2027,THE LAND,"'My dear fellow,' said the doctor, 'when you're older you'll know what"

2029,THE LAND,
2030,THE LAND,"'That doesn't help _me_. I can't! I can't!' cried Conroy, and burst into"
2031,THE LAND,tears.
2032,THE LAND,
2033,THE LAND,"'Don't apologise,' said Gilbert, when the paroxysm ended. 'I'm used to"
2034,THE LAND,people coming a little--unstuck in this room.'
2035,THE LAND,
2036,THE LAND,'It's those tabloids!' Conroy stamped his foot feebly as he blew his
2037,THE LAND,"nose. 'They've knocked me out. I used to be fit once. Oh, I've tried"
2038,THE LAND,exercise and everything. But--if one sits down for a minute when it's
2039,THE LAND,due--even at four in the morning--it runs up behind one.'
2040,THE LAND,
2041,THE LAND,'Ye-es. Many things come in the quiet of the morning. You always know
2042,THE LAND,when the visitation is due?'
2043,THE LAND,
2044,THE LAND,'What would I give not to be sure!' he sobbed.
2045,THE LAND,
2046,THE LAND,'We'll put that aside for the moment. I'm thinking of a case where what
2047,THE LAND,we'll call anÃ¦mia of the brain was masked (I don't say cured) by
2048,THE LAND,"vibration. He couldn't sleep, or thought he couldn't, but a steamer"
2049,THE LAND,voyage and the thump of the screw--'
2050,THE LAND,
2051,THE LAND,'A steamer? After what I've told you!' Conroy almost shrieked. 'I'd
2052,THE LAND,sooner ...'
2053,THE LAND,
2054,THE LAND,"'Of course _not_ a steamer in your case, but a long railway journey the"
2055,THE LAND,"next time you think it will trouble you. It sounds absurd, but--'"
2056,THE LAND,
2057,THE LAND,"'I'd try anything. I nearly have,' Conroy sighed."
2058,THE LAND,
2059,THE LAND,'Nonsense! I've given you a tonic that will clear _that_ notion from
2060,THE LAND,"your head. Give the train a chance, and don't begin the journey by"
2061,THE LAND,"bucking yourself up with tabloids. Take them along, but hold them in"
2062,THE LAND,reserve--in reserve.'
2063,THE LAND,
2064,THE LAND,"'D'you think I've self-control enough, after what you've heard?' said"
2065,THE LAND,Conroy.
2066,THE LAND,
2067,THE LAND,"Dr. Gilbert smiled. 'Yes. After what I've seen,' he glanced round the"
2068,THE LAND,"room, 'I have no hesitation in saying you have quite as much"
2069,THE LAND,self-control as many other people. I'll write you later about your
2070,THE LAND,"journey. Meantime, the tonic,' and he gave some general directions"
2071,THE LAND,before Conroy left.
2072,THE LAND,
2073,THE LAND,"An hour later Dr. Gilbert hurried to the links, where the others of his"
2074,THE LAND,"regular week-end game awaited him. It was a rigid round, played as usual"
2075,THE LAND,"at the trot, for the tension of the week lay as heavy on the two King's"
2076,THE LAND,Counsels and Sir John Chartres as on Gilbert. The lawyers were old
2077,THE LAND,"enemies of the Admiralty Court, and Sir John of the frosty eyebrows and"
2078,THE LAND,"Abernethy manner was bracketed with, but before, Rutherford Gilbert"
2079,THE LAND,among nerve-specialists.
2080,THE LAND,
2081,THE LAND,At the Club-house afterwards the lawyers renewed their squabble over a
2082,THE LAND,"tangled collision case, and the doctors as naturally compared"
2083,THE LAND,professional matters.
2084,THE LAND,
2085,THE LAND,"'Lies--all lies,' said Sir John, when Gilbert had told him Conroy's"
2086,THE LAND,"trouble. '_Post hoc, propter hoc_. The man or woman who drugs is _ipso"
2087,THE LAND,facto_ a liar. You've no imagination.'
2088,THE LAND,
2089,THE LAND,''Pity you haven't a little--occasionally.'
2090,THE LAND,
2091,THE LAND,'I have believed a certain type of patient in my time. It's always the
2092,THE LAND,same. For reasons not given in the consulting-room they take to the
2093,THE LAND,"drug. Certain symptoms follow. They will swear to you, and believe it,"
2094,THE LAND,that they took the drug to mask the symptoms. What does your man use?
2095,THE LAND,Najdolene? I thought so. I had practically the duplicate of your case
2096,THE LAND,last Thursday. Same old Najdolene--same old lie.'
2097,THE LAND,
2098,THE LAND,"'Tell me the symptoms, and I'll draw my own inferences, Johnnie.'"
2099,THE LAND,
2100,THE LAND,"'Symptoms! The girl was rank poisoned with Najdolene. Ramping, stamping"
2101,THE LAND,"possession. Gad, I thought she'd have the chandelier down.'"
2102,THE LAND,
2103,THE LAND,"'Mine came unstuck too, and he has the physique of a bull,' said"
2104,THE LAND,Gilbert. 'What delusions had yours?'
2105,THE LAND,
2106,THE LAND,'Faces--faces with mildew on them. In any other walk of life we'd call
2107,THE LAND,"it the Horrors. She told me, of course, she took the drugs to mask the"
2108,THE LAND,"faces. _Post hoc, propter hoc_ again. All liars!'"
2109,THE LAND,
2110,THE LAND,'What's that?' said the senior K.C. quickly. 'Sounds professional.'
2111,THE LAND,
2112,THE LAND,"'Go away! Not for you, Sandy.' Sir John turned a shoulder against him"
2113,THE LAND,and walked with Gilbert in the chill evening.
2114,THE LAND,
2115,THE LAND,"To Conroy in his chambers came, one week later, this letter:"
2116,THE LAND,
2117,THE LAND,DEAR MR. CONROY--If your plan of a night's trip on the 17th
2118,THE LAND,"still holds good, and you have no particular destination in"
2119,THE LAND,"view, you could do me a kindness. A Miss Henschil, in whom I"
2120,THE LAND,"am interested, goes down to the West by the 10.8 from"
2121,THE LAND,Waterloo (Number 3 platform) on that night. She is not
2122,THE LAND,"exactly an invalid, but, like so many of us, a little shaken"
2123,THE LAND,"in her nerves. Her maid, of course, accompanies her, but if I"
2124,THE LAND,knew you were in the same train it would be an additional
2125,THE LAND,source of strength. Will you please write and let me know
2126,THE LAND,"whether the 10.8 from Waterloo, Number 3 platform, on the"
2127,THE LAND,"17th, suits you, and I will meet you there? Don't forget my"
2128,THE LAND,"caution, and keep up the tonic.--Yours sincerely,"

2130,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.
2131,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2132,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'He knows I'm scarcely fit to look after myself,' was Conroy's thought."
2133,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'And he wants me to look after a woman!'
2134,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2135,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Yet, at the end of half an hour's irresolution, he accepted."
2136,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2137,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Now Conroy's trouble, which had lasted for years, was this:"
2138,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2139,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"On a certain night, while he lay between sleep and wake, he would be"
2140,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"overtaken by a long shuddering sigh, which he learned to know was the"
2141,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"sign that his brain had once more conceived its horror, and in time--in"
2142,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,due time--would bring it forth.
2143,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2144,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Drugs could so well veil that horror that it shuffled along no worse
2145,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,than as a freezing dream in a procession of disorderly dreams; but over
2146,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,the return of the event drugs had no control. Once that sigh had passed
2147,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"his lips the thing was inevitable, and through the days granted before"
2148,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,its rebirth he walked in torment. For the first two years he had striven
2149,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"to fend it off by distractions, but neither exercise nor drink availed."
2150,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Then he had come to the tabloids of the excellent M. Najdol. These
2151,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"guarantee, on the label, 'Refreshing and absolutely natural sleep to the"
2152,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,soul-weary.' They are carried in a case with a spring which presses one
2153,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"scented tabloid to the end of the tube, whence it can be lipped off in"
2154,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,stroking the moustache or adjusting the veil.
2155,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2156,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Three years of M. Najdol's preparations do not fit a man for many
2157,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"careers. His friends, who knew he did not drink, assumed that Conroy had"
2158,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"strained his heart through valiant outdoor exercises, and Conroy had"
2159,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"with some care invented an imaginary doctor, symptoms, and regimen,"
2160,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,which he discussed with them and with his mother in Hereford. She
2161,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"maintained that he would grow out of it, and recommended nux vomica."
2162,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2163,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"When at last Conroy faced a real doctor, it was, he hoped, to be saved"
2164,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,from suicide by a strait-waistcoat. Yet Dr. Gilbert had but given him
2165,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"more drugs--a tonic, for instance, that would couple railway"
2166,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,carnages--and had advised a night in the train. Not alone the horrors of
2167,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,a railway journey (for which a man who dare keep no servant must e'en
2168,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"pack, label, and address his own bag), but the necessity for holding"
2169,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,himself in hand before a stranger 'a little shaken in her nerves.'
2170,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2171,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"He spent a long forenoon packing, because when he assembled and counted"
2172,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,things his mind slid off to the hours that remained of the day before
2173,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"his night, and he found himself counting minutes aloud. At such times"
2174,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,the injustice of his fate would drive him to revolts which no servant
2175,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"should witness, but on this evening Dr. Gilbert's tonic held him fairly"
2176,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,calm while he put up his patent razors.
2177,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2178,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Waterloo Station shook him into real life. The change for his ticket
2179,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"needed concentration, if only to prevent shillings and pence turning"
2180,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,into minutes at the booking-office; and he spoke quickly to a porter
2181,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,about the disposition of his bag. The old 10.8 from Waterloo to the West
2182,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"was an all-night caravan that halted, in the interests of the milk"
2183,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"traffic, at almost every station."
2184,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2185,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Dr. Gilbert stood by the door of the one composite corridor-coach; an
2186,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,older and stouter man behind him. 'So glad you're here!' he cried. 'Let
2187,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,me get your ticket.'
2188,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2189,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Certainly not,' Conroy answered. 'I got it myself--long ago. My bag's"
2190,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"in too,' he added proudly."
2191,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2192,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'I beg your pardon. Miss Henschil's here. I'll introduce you.'
2193,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2194,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'But--but,' he stammered--'think of the state I'm in. If anything"
2195,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,happens I shall collapse.'
2196,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2197,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Not you. You'd rise to the occasion like a bird. And as for the
2198,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,self-control you were talking of the other day'--Gilbert swung him
2199,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,round--'look!'
2200,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2201,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,A young man in an ulster over a silk-faced frock-coat stood by the
2202,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"carriage window, weeping shamelessly."
2203,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2204,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Oh, but that's only drink,' Conroy said. 'I haven't had one of my--my"
2205,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,things since lunch.'
2206,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2207,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Excellent!' said Gilbert. 'I knew I could depend on you. Come along.
2208,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Wait for a minute, Chartres.'"
2209,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2210,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"A tall woman, veiled, sat by the far window. She bowed her head as the"
2211,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,doctor murmured Conroy knew not what. Then he disappeared and the
2212,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,inspector came for tickets.
2213,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2214,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'My maid--next compartment,' she said slowly."
2215,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2216,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy showed his ticket, but in returning it to the sleeve-pocket of"
2217,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,his ulster the little silver Najdolene case slipped from his glove and
2218,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,fell to the floor. He snatched it up as the moving train flung him
2219,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,into his seat.
2220,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2221,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'How nice!' said the woman. She leisurely lifted her veil, unbottoned"
2222,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"the first button of her left glove, and pressed out from its palm a"
2223,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Najdolene-case.
2224,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2225,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Don't!' said Conroy, not realising he had spoken."
2226,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2227,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I beg your pardon.' The deep voice was measured, even, and low. Conroy"
2228,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,knew what made it so.
2229,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2230,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I said ""don't""! He wouldn't like you to do it!'"
2231,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2232,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No, he would not.' She held the tube with its ever-presented tabloid"
2233,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"between finger and thumb. 'But aren't you one of the--ah--""soul-weary"""
2234,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,too?'
2235,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2236,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'That's why. Oh, please don't! Not at first. I--I haven't had one since"
2237,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,morning. You--you'll set me off!'
2238,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2239,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'You? Are you so far gone as that?'
2240,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2241,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"He nodded, pressing his palms together. The train jolted through"
2242,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Vauxhall points, and was welcomed with the clang of empty milk-cans"
2243,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,for the West.
2244,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2245,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"After long silence she lifted her great eyes, and, with an innocence"
2246,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"that would have deceived any sound man, asked Conroy to call her maid to"
2247,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,bring her a forgotten book.
2248,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2249,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Conroy shook his head. 'No. Our sort can't read. Don't!'
2250,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2251,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Were you sent to watch me?' The voice never changed.
2252,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2253,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Me? I need a keeper myself much more--_this_ night of all!'
2254,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2255,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'This night? Have you a night, then? They disbelieved _me_ when I told"
2256,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"them of mine.' She leaned back and laughed, always slowly. 'Aren't"
2257,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,doctors stu-upid? They don't know.'
2258,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2259,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She leaned her elbow on her knee, lifted her veil that had fallen, and,"
2260,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"chin in hand, stared at him. He looked at her--till his eyes were"
2261,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,blurred with tears.
2262,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2263,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Have I been there, think you?' she said."
2264,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2265,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Surely--surely,' Conroy answered, for he had well seen the fear and the"
2266,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"horror that lived behind the heavy-lidded eyes, the fine tracing on the"
2267,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"broad forehead, and the guard set about the desirable mouth."
2268,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2269,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Then--suppose we have one--just one apiece? I've gone without since
2270,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,this afternoon.'
2271,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2272,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"He put up his hand, and would have shouted, but his voice broke."
2273,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2274,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Don't! Can't you see that it helps me to help you to keep it off? Don't
2275,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,let's both go down together.'
2276,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2277,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'But I want one. It's a poor heart that never rejoices. Just one. It's
2278,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,my night.'
2279,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2280,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'It's mine--too. My sixty-fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.' He shut his"
2281,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,lips firmly against the tide of visualised numbers that threatened to
2282,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,carry him along.
2283,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2284,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Ah, it's only my thirty-ninth.' She paused as he had done. 'I wonder if"
2285,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,I shall last into the sixties.... Talk to me or I shall go crazy. You're
2286,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,a man. You're the stronger vessel. Tell me when you went to pieces.'
2287,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2288,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven--eight--I beg your pardon.'"
2289,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2290,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Not in the least. I always pretend I've dropped a stitch of my
2291,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"knitting. I count the days till the last day, then the hours, then the"
2292,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,minutes. Do you?'
2293,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2294,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I don't think I've done very much else for the last--' said Conroy,"
2295,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"shivering, for the night was cold, with a chill he recognised."
2296,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2297,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Oh, how comforting to find some one who can talk sense! It's not always"
2298,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"the same date, is it?'"
2299,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2300,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'What difference would that make?' He unbuttoned his ulster with a jerk.
2301,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'You're a sane woman. Can't you see the wicked--wicked--wicked' (dust
2302,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,flew from the padded arm-rest as he struck it) unfairness of it? What
2303,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,have I done?'
2304,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2305,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,She laid her large hand on his shoulder very firmly.
2306,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2307,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'If you begin to think over that,' she said, 'you'll go to pieces and be"
2308,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"ashamed. Tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine. Only be quiet--be quiet,"
2309,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"lad, or you'll set me off!' She made shift to soothe him, though her"
2310,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,chin trembled.
2311,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2312,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Well,' said he at last, picking at the arm-rest between them, 'mine's"
2313,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"nothing much, of course.'"
2314,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2315,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Don't be a fool! That's for doctors--and mothers.'
2316,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2317,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'It's Hell,' Conroy muttered. 'It begins on a steamer--on a stifling hot"
2318,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,night. I come out of my cabin. I pass through the saloon where the
2319,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"stewards have rolled up the carpets, and the boards are bare and hot"
2320,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,and soapy.'
2321,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2322,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I've travelled too,' she said."
2323,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2324,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Ah! I come on deck. I walk down a covered alleyway. Butcher's meat,"
2325,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"bananas, oil, that sort of smell.'"
2326,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2327,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Again she nodded.
2328,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2329,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'It's a lead-coloured steamer, and the sea's lead-coloured. Perfectly"
2330,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"smooth sea--perfectly still ship, except for the engines running, and"
2331,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,her waves going off in lines and lines and lines--dull grey. All this
2332,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,time I know something's going to happen.'
2333,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2334,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I know. Something going to happen,' she whispered."
2335,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2336,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Then I hear a thud in the engine-room. Then the noise of machinery
2337,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,falling down--like fire-irons--and then two most awful yells. They're
2338,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"more like hoots, and I know--I know while I listen--that it means that"
2339,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,two men have died as they hooted. It was their last breath hooting out
2340,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,of them--in most awful pain. Do you understand?'
2341,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2342,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'I ought to. Go on.'
2343,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2344,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'That's the first part. Then I hear bare feet running along the
2345,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,alleyway. One of the scalded men comes up behind me and says quite
2346,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"distinctly, ""My friend! All is lost!"" Then he taps me on the shoulder"
2347,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,and I hear him drop down dead.' He panted and wiped his forehead.
2348,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2349,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'So that is your night?' she said.
2350,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2351,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'That is my night. It comes every few weeks--so many days after I get
2352,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,what I call sentence. Then I begin to count.'
2353,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2354,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Get sentence? D'you mean _this_?' She half closed her eyes, drew a"
2355,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"deep breath, and shuddered. '""Notice"" I call it. Sir John thought it was"
2356,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,all lies.'
2357,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2358,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She had unpinned her hat and thrown it on the seat opposite, showing the"
2359,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"immense mass of her black hair, rolled low in the nape of the columnar"
2360,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,neck and looped over the left ear. But Conroy had no eyes except for her
2361,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,grave eyes.
2362,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2363,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Listen now!' said she. 'I walk down a road, a white sandy road near the"
2364,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"sea. There are broken fences on either side, and Men come and look at me"
2365,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,over them.'
2366,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2367,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Just men? Do they speak?'
2368,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2369,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'They try to. Their faces are all mildewy--eaten away,' and she hid her"
2370,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,face for an instant with her left hand. 'It's the Faces--the Faces!'
2371,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2372,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Yes. Like my two hoots. I know.'
2373,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2374,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Ah! But the place itself--the bareness--and the glitter and the salt
2375,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"smells, and the wind blowing the sand! The Men run after me and I"
2376,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,run.... I know what's coming too. One of them touches me.'
2377,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2378,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Yes! What comes then? We've both shirked that.'
2379,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2380,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'One awful shock--not palpitation, but shock, shock, shock!'"
2381,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2382,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'As though your soul were being stopped--as you'd stop a finger-bowl
2383,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,humming?' he said.
2384,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2385,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Just that,' she answered. 'One's very soul--the soul that one lives"
2386,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,by--stopped. So!'
2387,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2388,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She drove her thumb deep into the arm-rest. 'And now,' she whined to"
2389,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"him, 'now that we've stirred each other up this way, mightn't we have"
2390,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,just one?'
2391,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2392,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No,' said Conroy, shaking. 'Let's hold on. We're past'--he peered out"
2393,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,of the black windows--'Woking. There's the Necropolis. How long
2394,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,till dawn?'
2395,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2396,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Oh, cruel long yet. If one dozes for a minute, it catches one.'"
2397,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2398,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'And how d'you find that this'--he tapped the palm of his glove--'helps
2399,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,you?'
2400,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2401,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'It covers up the thing from being too real--if one takes enough--you
2402,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,know. Only--only--one loses everything else. I've been no more than a
2403,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,bogie-girl for two years. What would you give to be real again? This
2404,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,lying's such a nuisance.'
2405,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2406,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'One must protect oneself--and there's one's mother to think of,' he"
2407,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,answered.
2408,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2409,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'True. I hope allowances are made for us somewhere. Our burden--can you
2410,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,hear?--our burden is heavy enough.'
2411,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2412,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She rose, towering into the roof of the carriage. Conroy's ungentle grip"
2413,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,pulled her back.
2414,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2415,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Now _you_ are foolish. Sit down,' said he."
2416,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2417,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'But the cruelty of it! Can't you see it? Don't you feel it? Let's take
2418,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,one now--before I--'
2419,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2420,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Sit down!' cried Conroy, and the sweat stood again on his forehead. He"
2421,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"had fought through a few nights, and had been defeated on more, and he"
2422,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,knew the rebellion that flares beyond control to exhaustion.
2423,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2424,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She smoothed her hair and dropped back, but for a while her head and"
2425,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,throat moved with the sickening motion of a captured wry-neck.
2426,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2427,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Once,' she said, spreading out her hands, 'I ripped my counterpane"
2428,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,from end to end. That takes strength. I had it then. I've little now.
2429,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"""All dorn,"" as my little niece says. And you, lad?'"
2430,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2431,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'""All dorn""! Let me keep your case for you till the morning.'"
2432,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2433,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'But the cold feeling is beginning.'
2434,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2435,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Lend it me, then.'"
2436,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2437,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'And the drag down my right side. I shan't be able to move in a minute.'
2438,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2439,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I can scarcely lift my arm myself,' said Conroy. 'We're in for it.'"
2440,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2441,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Then why are you so foolish? You know it'll be easier if we have only
2442,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,one--only one apiece.'
2443,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2444,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,She was lifting the case to her mouth. With tremendous effort Conroy
2445,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"caught it. The two moved like jointed dolls, and when their hands met it"
2446,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,was as wood on wood.
2447,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2448,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'You must--not!' said Conroy. His jaws stiffened, and the cold climbed"
2449,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,from his feet up.
2450,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2451,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Why--must--I--not?' She repeated the words idiotically.
2452,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2453,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy could only shake his head, while he bore down on the hand and the"
2454,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,case in it.
2455,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2456,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Her speech went from her altogether. The wonderful lips rested half over
2457,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"the even teeth, the breath was in the nostrils only, the eyes dulled,"
2458,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"the face set grey, and through the glove the hand struck like ice."
2459,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2460,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Presently her soul came back and stood behind her eyes--only thing that
2461,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,had life in all that place--stood and looked for Conroy's soul. He too
2462,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"was fettered in every limb, but somewhere at an immense distance he"
2463,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,heard his heart going about its work as the engine-room carries on
2464,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"through and beneath the all but overwhelming wave. His one hope, he"
2465,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"knew, was not to lose the eyes that clung to his, because there was an"
2466,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Evil abroad which would possess him if he looked aside by a
2467,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,hair-breadth.
2468,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2469,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,The rest was darkness through which some distant planet spun while
2470,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,cymbals clashed. (Beyond Farnborough the 10.8 rolls out many empty
2471,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,milk-cans at every halt.) Then a body came to life with intolerable
2472,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"pricklings. Limb by limb, after agonies of terror, that body returned to"
2473,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"him, steeped in most perfect physical weariness such as follows a long"
2474,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,day's rowing. He saw the heavy lids droop over her eyes--the watcher
2475,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"behind them departed--and, his soul sinking into assured peace,"
2476,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Conroy slept.
2477,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2478,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Light on his eyes and a salt breath roused him without shock. Her hand
2479,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"still held his. She slept, forehead down upon it, but the movement of"
2480,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"his waking waked her too, and she sneezed like a child."
2481,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2482,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I--I think it's morning,' said Conroy."
2483,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2484,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'And nothing has happened! Did you see your Men? I didn't see my Faces.
2485,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Does it mean we've escaped? Did--did you take any after I went to sleep?
2486,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"I'll swear I didn't,' she stammered."
2487,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2488,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No, there wasn't any need. We've slept through it.'"
2489,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2490,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No need! Thank God! There was no need! Oh, look!'"
2491,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2492,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,The train was running under red cliffs along a sea-wall washed by waves
2493,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,that were colourless in the early light. Southward the sun rose mistily
2494,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,upon the Channel.
2495,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2496,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She leaned out of the window and breathed to the bottom of her lungs,"
2497,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,while the wind wrenched down her dishevelled hair and blew it below
2498,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,her waist.
2499,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2500,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Well!' she said with splendid eyes. 'Aren't you still waiting for
2501,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,something to happen?'
2502,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2503,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No. Not till next time. We've been let off,' Conroy answered, breathing"
2504,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,as deeply as she.
2505,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2506,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Then we ought to say our prayers.'
2507,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2508,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'What nonsense! Some one will see us.'
2509,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2510,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'We needn't kneel. Stand up and say ""Our Father."" We _must_!'"
2511,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2512,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,It was the first time since childhood that Conroy had prayed. They
2513,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,laughed hysterically when a curve threw them against an arm-rest.
2514,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2515,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Now for breakfast!' she cried. 'My maid--Nurse Blaber--has the basket
2516,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,and things. It'll be ready in twenty minutes. Oh! Look at my hair!' and
2517,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,she went out laughing.
2518,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2519,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy's first discovery, made without fumbling or counting letters on"
2520,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"taps, was that the London and South Western's allowance of washing-water"
2521,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"is inadequate. He used every drop, rioting in the cold tingle on neck"
2522,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"and arms. To shave in a moving train balked him, but the next halt gave"
2523,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"him a chance, which, to his own surprise, he took. As he stared at"
2524,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,himself in the mirror he smiled and nodded. There were points about this
2525,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"person with the clear, if sunken, eye and the almost uncompressed mouth."
2526,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"But when he bore his bag back to his compartment, the weight of it on a"
2527,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,limp arm humbled that new pride.
2528,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2529,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'My friend,' he said, half aloud, 'you go into training. You're putty.'"
2530,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2531,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She met him in the spare compartment, where her maid had laid breakfast."
2532,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2533,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'By Jove!' he said, halting at the doorway, 'I hadn't realised how"
2534,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,beautiful you were!'
2535,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2536,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'The same to you, lad. Sit down. I could eat a horse.'"
2537,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2538,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I shouldn't,' said the maid quietly. 'The less you eat the better.' She"
2539,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"was a small, freckled woman, with light fluffy hair and pale-blue eyes"
2540,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,that looked through all veils.
2541,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2542,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'This is Miss Blaber,' said Miss Henschil. 'He's one of the soul-weary"
2543,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"too, Nursey.'"
2544,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2545,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'I know it. But when one has just given it up a full meal doesn't agree.
2546,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,That's why I've only brought you bread and butter.'
2547,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2548,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She went out quietly, and Conroy reddened."
2549,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2550,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'We're still children, you see,' said Miss Henschil. 'But I'm well"
2551,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,enough to feel some shame of it. D'you take sugar?'
2552,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2553,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"They starved together heroically, and Nurse Blaber was good enough to"
2554,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,signify approval when she came to clear away.
2555,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2556,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Nursey?' Miss Henschil insinuated, and flushed."
2557,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2558,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Do you smoke?' said the nurse coolly to Conroy.
2559,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2560,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I haven't in years. Now you mention it, I think I'd like a"
2561,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,cigarette--or something.'
2562,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2563,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'I used to. D'you think it would keep me quiet?' Miss Henschil said.
2564,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2565,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Perhaps. Try these.' The nurse handed them her cigarette-case.
2566,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2567,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Don't take anything else,' she commanded, and went away with the"
2568,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,tea-basket.
2569,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2570,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Good!' grunted Conroy, between mouthfuls of tobacco."
2571,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2572,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Better than nothing,' said Miss Henschil; but for a while they felt"
2573,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"ashamed, yet with the comfort of children punished together."
2574,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2575,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Now,' she whispered, 'who were you when you were a man?'"
2576,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2577,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy told her, and in return she gave him her history. It delighted"
2578,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"them both to deal once more in worldly concerns--families, names,"
2579,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"places, and dates--with a person of understanding."
2580,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2581,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She came, she said, of Lancashire folk--wealthy cotton-spinners, who"
2582,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,still kept the broadened _a_ and slurred aspirate of the old stock. She
2583,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,lived with an old masterful mother in an opulent world north of
2584,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Lancaster Gate, where people in Society gave parties at a Mecca called"
2585,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,the Langham Hotel.
2586,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2587,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She herself had been launched into Society there, and the flowers at the"
2588,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"ball had cost eighty-seven pounds; but, being reckoned peculiar, she had"
2589,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"made few friends among her own sex. She had attracted many men, for she"
2590,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"was a beauty--_the_ beauty, in fact, of Society, she said."
2591,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2592,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She spoke utterly without shame or reticence, as a life-prisoner tells"
2593,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,his past to a fellow-prisoner; and Conroy nodded across the smoke-rings.
2594,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2595,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Do you remember when you got into the carriage?' she asked. '(Oh, I"
2596,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"wish I had some knitting!) Did you notice aught, lad?'"
2597,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2598,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Conroy thought back. It was ages since. 'Wasn't there some one outside
2599,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,the door--crying?' he asked.
2600,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2601,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'He's--he's the little man I was engaged to,' she said. 'But I made him"
2602,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"break it off. I told him 'twas no good. But he won't, yo' see.'"
2603,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2604,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'_That_ fellow? Why, he doesn't come up to your shoulder.'"
2605,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2606,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'That's naught to do with it. I think all the world of him. I'm a
2607,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"foolish wench'--her speech wandered as she settled herself cosily, one"
2608,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,elbow on the arm-rest. 'We'd been engaged--I couldn't help that--and he
2609,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"worships the ground I tread on. But it's no use. I'm not responsible,"
2610,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"you see. His two sisters are against it, though I've the money. They're"
2611,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"right, but they think it's the dri-ink,' she drawled. 'They're"
2612,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Methody--the Skinners. You see, their grandfather that started the"
2613,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Patton Mills, he died o' the dri-ink.'"
2614,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2615,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I see,' said Conroy. The grave face before him under the lifted veil"
2616,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,was troubled.
2617,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2618,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'George Skinner.' She breathed it softly. 'I'd make him a good wife, by"
2619,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,God's gra-ace--if I could. But it's no use. I'm not responsible. But
2620,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"he'll not take ""No"" for an answer. I used to call him ""Toots."" He's of"
2621,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"no consequence, yo' see.'"
2622,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2623,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'That's in Dickens,' said Conroy, quite quickly. 'I haven't thought of"
2624,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Toots for years. He was at Doctor Blimber's.'
2625,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2626,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'And so--that's my trouble,' she concluded, ever so slightly wringing"
2627,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,her hands. 'But I--don't you think--there's hope now?'
2628,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2629,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Eh?' said Conroy. 'Oh yes! This is the first time I've turned my corner
2630,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"without help. With your help, I should say.'"
2631,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2632,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'It'll come back, though.'"
2633,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2634,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Then shall we meet it in the same way? Here's my card. Write me your
2635,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"train, and we'll go together.'"
2636,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2637,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Yes. We must do that. But between times--when we want--' She looked at
2638,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"her palm, the four fingers working on it. 'It's hard to give 'em up.'"
2639,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2640,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'But think what we have gained already, and let me have the case to"
2641,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,keep.'
2642,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2643,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She shook her head, and threw her cigarette out of the window. 'Not"
2644,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,yet.'
2645,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2646,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Then let's lend our cases to Nurse, and we'll get through to-day on"
2647,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,cigarettes. I'll call her while we feel strong.'
2648,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2649,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"She hesitated, but yielded at last, and Nurse accepted the offerings"
2650,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,with a smile.
2651,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2652,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'_You'll_ be all right,' she said to Miss Henschil. 'But if I were"
2653,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,you'--to Conroy--'I'd take strong exercise.'
2654,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2655,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,When they reached their destination Conroy set himself to obey Nurse
2656,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Blaber. He had no remembrance of that day, except one streak of blue sea"
2657,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"to his left, gorse-bushes to his right, and, before him, a coast-guard's"
2658,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,track marked with white-washed stones that he counted up to the far
2659,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,thousands. As he returned to the little town he saw Miss Henschil on the
2660,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"beach below the cliffs. She kneeled at Nurse Blaber's feet, weeping"
2661,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,and pleading.
2662,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2663,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,*       *       *       *       *
2664,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2665,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Twenty-five days later a telegram came to Conroy's rooms: '_Notice
2666,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,given. Waterloo again. Twenty-fourth.'_ That same evening he was wakened
2667,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,by the shudder and the sigh that told him his sentence had gone forth.
2668,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Yet he reflected on his pillow that he had, in spite of lapses, snatched"
2669,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"something like three weeks of life, which included several rides on a"
2670,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,horse before breakfast--the hour one most craves Najdolene; five
2671,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,consecutive evenings on the river at Hammersmith in a tub where he had
2672,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,well stretched the white arms that passing crews mocked at; a game of
2673,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"rackets at his club; three dinners, one small dance, and one human"
2674,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"flirtation with a human woman. More notable still, he had settled his"
2675,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"month's accounts, only once confusing petty cash with the days of grace"
2676,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,allowed him. Next morning he rode his hired beast in the park
2677,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"victoriously. He saw Miss Henschil on horse-back near Lancaster Gate,"
2678,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,talking to a young man at the railings.
2679,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2680,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,She wheeled and cantered toward him.
2681,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2682,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'By Jove! How well you look!' he cried, without salutation. 'I didn't"
2683,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,know you rode.'
2684,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2685,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I used to once,' she replied. 'I'm all soft now.'"
2686,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2687,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,They swept off together down the ride.
2688,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2689,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Your beast pulls,' he said."
2690,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2691,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Wa-ant him to. Gi-gives me something to think of. How've you been?'
2692,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,she panted. 'I wish chemists' shops hadn't red lights.'
2693,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2694,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Have you slipped out and bought some, then?'"
2695,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2696,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'You don't know Nursey. Eh, but it's good to be on a horse again! This"
2697,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,chap cost me two hundred.'
2698,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2699,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Then you've been swindled,' said Conroy."
2700,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2701,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I know it, but it's no odds. I must go back to Toots and send him away."
2702,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,He's neglecting his work for me.'
2703,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2704,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,She swung her heavy-topped animal on his none too sound hocks.
2705,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"''Sentence come, lad?'"
2706,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2707,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Yes. But I'm not minding it so much this time.'
2708,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2709,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Waterloo, then--and God help us!' She thundered back to the little"
2710,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,frock-coated figure that waited faithfully near the gate.
2711,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2712,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Conroy felt the spring sun on his shoulders and trotted home. That
2713,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"evening he went out with a man in a pair oar, and was rowed to a"
2714,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,standstill. But the other man owned he could not have kept the pace five
2715,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,minutes longer.
2716,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2717,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,*       *       *       *       *
2718,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2719,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"He carried his bag all down Number 3 platform at Waterloo, and hove it"
2720,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,with one hand into the rack.
2721,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2722,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Well done!' said Nurse Blaber, in the corridor. 'We've improved too.'"
2723,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2724,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Dr. Gilbert and an older man came out of the next compartment.
2725,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2726,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Hallo!' said Gilbert. 'Why haven't you been to see me, Mr. Conroy? Come"
2727,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"under the lamp. Take off your hat. No--no. Sit, you young giant. Ve-ry"
2728,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"good. Look here a minute, Johnnie.'"
2729,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2730,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"A little, round-bellied, hawk-faced person glared at him."
2731,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2732,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Gilbert was right about the beauty of the beast,' he muttered. 'D'you"
2733,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"keep it in your glove now?' he went on, and punched Conroy in the"
2734,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,short ribs.
2735,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2736,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No,' said Conroy meekly, but without coughing. 'Nowhere--on my honour!"
2737,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,I've chucked it for good.'
2738,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2739,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Wait till you are a sound man before you say _that_, Mr. Conroy.' Sir"
2740,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"John Chartres stumped out, saying to Gilbert in the corridor, 'It's all"
2741,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"very fine, but the question is shall I or we ""Sir Pandarus of Troy"
2742,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"become,"" eh? We're bound to think of the children.'"
2743,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2744,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Have you been vetted?' said Miss Henschil, a few minutes after the"
2745,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,train started. 'May I sit with you? I--I don't trust myself yet. I can't
2746,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"give up as easily as you can, seemingly.'"
2747,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2748,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Can't you? I never saw any one so improved in a month.'
2749,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2750,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Look here!' She reached across to the rack, single-handed lifted"
2751,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy's bag, and held it at arm's length. 'I counted ten slowly. And I"
2752,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"didn't think of hours or minutes,' she boasted."
2753,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2754,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Don't remind me,' he cried."
2755,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2756,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Ah! Now I've reminded myself. I wish I hadn't. Do you think it'll be
2757,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,easier for us to-night?'
2758,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2759,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Oh, don't.' The smell of the carriage had brought back all his last"
2760,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"trip to him, and Conroy moved uneasily."
2761,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2762,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I'm sorry. I've brought some games,' she went on. 'Draughts and"
2763,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"cards--but they all mean counting. I wish I'd brought chess, but I can't"
2764,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,play chess. What can we do? Talk about something.'
2765,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2766,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Well, how's Toots, to begin with?' said Conroy."
2767,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2768,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Why? Did you see him on the platform?'
2769,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2770,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'No. Was he there? I didn't notice.'
2771,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2772,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Oh yes. He doesn't understand. He's desperately jealous. I told him it
2773,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,doesn't matter. Will you please let me hold your hand? I believe I'm
2774,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,beginning to get the chill.'
2775,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2776,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Toots ought to envy me,' said Conroy."
2777,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2778,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'He does. He paid you a high compliment the other night. He's taken to
2779,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,calling again--in spite of all they say.'
2780,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2781,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy inclined his head. He felt cold, and knew surely he would be"
2782,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,colder.
2783,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2784,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'He said,' she yawned. '(Beg your pardon.) He said he couldn't see how I"
2785,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,could help falling in love with a man like you; and he called himself a
2786,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"damned little rat, and he beat his head on the piano last night.'"
2787,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2788,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'The piano? You play, then?'"
2789,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2790,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Only to him. He thinks the world of my accomplishments. Then I told him
2791,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,I wouldn't have you if you were the last man on earth instead of only
2792,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,the best-looking--not with a million in each stocking.'
2793,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2794,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No, not with a million in each stocking,' said Conroy vehemently."
2795,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Isn't that odd?'
2796,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2797,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I suppose so--to any one who doesn't know. Well, where was I? Oh,"
2798,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"George as good as told me I was deceiving him, and he wanted to go away"
2799,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"without saying good-night. He hates standing a-tiptoe, but he must if I"
2800,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,won't sit down.'
2801,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2802,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy would have smiled, but the chill that foreran the coming of the"
2803,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Lier-in-Wait was upon him, and his hand closed warningly on hers."
2804,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2805,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'And--and so--' she was trying to say, when her hour also overtook her,"
2806,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,leaving alive only the fear-dilated eyes that turned to Conroy. Hand
2807,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,froze on hand and the body with it as they waited for the horror in the
2808,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"blackness that heralded it. Yet through the worst Conroy saw, at an"
2809,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"uncountable distance, one minute glint of light in his night. Thither"
2810,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"would he go and escape his fear; and behold, that light was the light in"
2811,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"the watch-tower of her eyes, where her locked soul signalled to his"
2812,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,soul: 'Look at me!'
2813,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2814,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"In time, from him and from her, the Thing sheered aside, that each soul"
2815,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,might step down and resume its own concerns. He thought confusedly of
2816,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"people on the skirts of a thunderstorm, withdrawing from windows where"
2817,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"the torn night is, to their known and furnished beds. Then he dozed,"
2818,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,till in some drowsy turn his hand fell from her warmed hand.
2819,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2820,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'That's all. The Faces haven't come,' he heard her say. 'All--thank God!"
2821,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,I don't feel even I need what Nursey promised me. Do you?'
2822,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2823,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'No.' He rubbed his eyes. 'But don't make too sure.'
2824,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2825,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Certainly not. We shall have to try again next month. I'm afraid it
2826,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,will be an awful nuisance for you.'
2827,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2828,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Not to me, I assure you,' said Conroy, and they leaned back and"
2829,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"laughed at the flatness of the words, after the hells through which they"
2830,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,had just risen.
2831,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2832,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'And now,' she said, strict eyes on Conroy, '_why_ wouldn't you take"
2833,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,me--not with a million in each stocking?'
2834,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2835,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'I don't know. That's what I've been puzzling over.'
2836,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2837,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'So have I. We're as handsome a couple as I've ever seen. Are you well
2838,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"off, lad?'"
2839,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2840,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'They call me so,' said Conroy, smiling."
2841,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2842,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'That's North country.' She laughed again. Setting aside my good looks
2843,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"and yours, I've four thousand a year of my own, and the rents should"
2844,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,make it six. That's a match some old cats would lap tea all night to
2845,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,fettle up.'
2846,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2847,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'It is. Lucky Toots!' said Conroy.
2848,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2849,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Ay,' she answered, 'he'll be the luckiest lad in London if I win"
2850,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,through. Who's yours?'
2851,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2852,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No--no one, dear. I've been in Hell for years. I only want to get out"
2853,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,and be alive and--so on. Isn't that reason enough?'
2854,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2855,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Maybe, for a man. But I never minded things much till George came. I"
2856,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,was all stu-upid like.'
2857,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2858,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'So was I, but now I think I can live. It ought to be less next month,"
2859,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,oughtn't it?' he said.
2860,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2861,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I hope so. Ye-es. There's nothing much for a maid except to be married,"
2862,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"and I ask no more. Whoever yours is, when you've found her, she shall"
2863,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,have a wedding present from Mrs. George Skinner that--'
2864,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2865,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'But she wouldn't understand it any more than Toots.'
2866,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2867,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'He doesn't matter--except to me. I can't keep my eyes open, thank God!"
2868,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Good-night, lad.'"
2869,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2870,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy followed her with his eyes. Beauty there was, grace there was,"
2871,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"strength, and enough of the rest to drive better men than George Skinner"
2872,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,to beat their heads on piano-tops--but for the new-found life of him
2873,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Conroy could not feel one flutter of instinct or emotion that turned to
2874,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"herward. He put up his feet and fell asleep, dreaming of a joyous,"
2875,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,normal world recovered--with interest on arrears. There were many things
2876,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"in it, but no one face of any one woman."

2880,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Thrice afterward they took the same train, and each time their trouble"
2881,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"shrank and weakened. Miss Henschil talked of Toots, his multiplied"
2882,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"calls, the things he had said to his sisters, the much worse things his"
2883,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,sisters had replied; of the late (he seemed very dead to them) M.
2884,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Najdol's gifts for the soul-weary; of shopping, of house rents, and the"
2885,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,cost of really artistic furniture and linen.
2886,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2887,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Conroy explained the exercises in which he delighted--mighty labours of
2888,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"play undertaken against other mighty men, till he sweated and, having"
2889,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"bathed, slept. He had visited his mother, too, in Hereford, and he"
2890,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"talked something of her and of the home-life, which his body, cut out of"
2891,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"all clean life for five years, innocently and deeply enjoyed. Nurse"
2892,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Blaber was a little interested in Conroy's mother, but, as a rule, she"
2893,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,smoked her cigarette and read her paper-backed novels in her own
2894,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,compartment.
2895,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2896,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"On their last trip she volunteered to sit with them, and buried herself"
2897,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,in _The Cloister and the Hearth_ while they whispered together. On that
2898,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"occasion (it was near Salisbury) at two in the morning, when the"
2899,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Lier-in-Wait brushed them with his wing, it meant no more than that they"
2900,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"should cease talk for the instant, and for the instant hold hands, as"
2901,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,even utter strangers on the deep may do when their ship rolls underfoot.
2902,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2903,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'But still,' said Nurse Blaber, not looking up, 'I think your Mr."
2904,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Skinner might feel jealous of all this.'
2905,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2906,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'It would be difficult to explain,' said Conroy."
2907,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2908,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Then you'd better not be at my wedding,' Miss Henschil laughed."
2909,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2910,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'After all we've gone through, too. But I suppose you ought to leave me"
2911,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,out. Is the day fixed?' he cried.
2912,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2913,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Twenty-second of September--in spite of both his sisters. I can risk it
2914,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,now.' Her face was glorious as she flushed.
2915,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2916,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'My dear chap!' He shook hands unreservedly, and she gave back his grip"
2917,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,without flinching. 'I can't tell you how pleased I am!'
2918,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2919,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Gracious Heavens!' said Nurse Blaber, in a new voice. 'Oh, I beg your"
2920,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,pardon. I forgot I wasn't paid to be surprised.'
2921,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2922,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'What at? Oh, I see!' Miss Henschil explained to Conroy. 'She expected"
2923,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"you were going to kiss me, or I was going to kiss you, or something.'"
2924,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2925,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'After all you've gone through, as Mr. Conroy said,'"
2926,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2927,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'But I couldn't, could you?' said Miss Henschil, with a disgust as frank"
2928,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"as that on Conroy's face. 'It would be horrible--horrible. And yet, of"
2929,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"course, you're wonderfully handsome. How d'you account for it, Nursey?'"
2930,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2931,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Nurse Blaber shook her head. 'I was hired to cure you of a habit, dear."
2932,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,When you're cured I shall go on to the next case--that senile-decay one
2933,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,at Bourne-mouth I told you about.'
2934,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2935,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'And I shall be left alone with George! But suppose it isn't cured,'"
2936,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,said Miss Henschil of a sudden. Suppose it comes back again. What can I
2937,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,do? I can't send for _him_ in this way when I'm a married woman!' She
2938,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,pointed like an infant.
2939,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2940,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I'd come, of course,' Conroy answered. 'But, seriously, that is a"
2941,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,consideration.'
2942,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2943,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"They looked at each other, alarmed and anxious, and then toward Nurse"
2944,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Blaber, who closed her book, marked the place, and turned to face them."
2945,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2946,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Have you ever talked to your mother as you have to me?' she said.
2947,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2948,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'No. I might have spoken to dad--but mother's different. What d'you
2949,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,mean?'
2950,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2951,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'And you've never talked to your mother either, Mr. Conroy?'"
2952,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2953,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Not till I took Najdolene. Then I told her it was my heart. There's no
2954,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"need to say anything, now that I'm practically over it, is there?'"
2955,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2956,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Not if it doesn't come back, but--' She beckoned with a stumpy,"
2957,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,triumphant linger that drew their heads close together. 'You know I
2958,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"always go in and read a chapter to mother at tea, child.'"
2959,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2960,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I know you do. You're an angel,' Miss Henschil patted the blue"
2961,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"shoulder next her. 'Mother's Church of England now,' she explained. 'But"
2962,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,she'll have her Bible with her pikelets at tea every night like the
2963,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Skinners.'
2964,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2965,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'It was Naaman and Gehazi last Tuesday that gave me a clue. I said I'd
2966,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"never seen a case of leprosy, and your mother said she'd seen too many.'"
2967,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2968,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Where? She never told me,' Miss Henschil began."
2969,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2970,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'A few months before you were born--on her trip to Australia--at Mola or
2971,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Molo something or other. It took me three evenings to get it all out.'
2972,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2973,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Ay--mother's suspicious of questions,' said Miss Henschil to Conroy."
2974,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'She'll lock the door of every room she's in, if it's but for five"
2975,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"minutes. She was a Tackberry from Jarrow way, yo' see.'"
2976,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2977,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'She described your men to the life--men with faces all eaten away,"
2978,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,staring at her over the fence of a lepers' hospital in this Molo Island.
2979,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"They begged from her, and she ran, she told me, all down the street,"
2980,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,back to the pier. One touched her and she nearly fainted. She's ashamed
2981,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,of that still.'
2982,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2983,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'My men? The sand and the fences?' Miss Henschil muttered.
2984,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2985,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Yes. You know how tidy she is and how she hates wind. She remembered
2986,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,that the fences were broken--she remembered the wind blowing.
2987,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Sand--sun--salt wind--fences--faces--I got it all out of her, bit by"
2988,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,bit. You don't know what I know! And it all happened three or four
2989,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,months before you were born. There!' Nurse Blaber slapped her knee with
2990,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,her little hand triumphantly.
2991,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2992,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Would that account for it?' Miss Henschil shook from head to foot.
2993,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2994,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Absolutely. I don't care who you ask! You never imagined the thing. It
2995,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"was _laid_ on you. It happened on earth to _you_! Quick, Mr. Conroy,"
2996,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,she's too heavy for me! I'll get the flask.'
2997,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
2998,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Miss Henschil leaned forward and collapsed, as Conroy told her"
2999,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"afterwards, like a factory chimney. She came out of her swoon with teeth"
3000,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,that chattered on the cup.
3001,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3002,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'No--no,' she said, gulping. 'It's not hysterics. Yo' see I've no call"
3003,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,to hev 'em any more. No call--no reason whatever. God be praised! Can't
3004,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,yo' _feel_ I'm a right woman now?'
3005,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3006,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Stop hugging me!' said Nurse Blaber. 'You don't know your strength.
3007,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Finish the brandy and water. It's perfectly reasonable, and I'll lay"
3008,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,long odds Mr. Conroy's case is something of the same. I've been
3009,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,thinking--'
3010,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3011,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I wonder--' said Conroy, and pushed the girl back as she swayed again."
3012,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3013,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Nurse Blaber smoothed her pale hair. 'Yes. Your trouble, or something"
3014,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"like it, happened somewhere on earth or sea to the mother who bore you."
3015,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Ask her, child. Ask her and be done with it once for all.'"
3016,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3017,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I will,' said Conroy.... 'There ought to be--' He opened his bag and"
3018,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,hunted breathlessly.
3019,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3020,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Bless you! Oh, God bless you, Nursey!' Miss Henschil was sobbing. 'You"
3021,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,don't know what this means to me. It takes it all off--from the
3022,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,beginning.'
3023,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3024,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'But doesn't it make any difference to you now?' the nurse asked
3025,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,curiously. 'Now that you're rightfully a woman?'
3026,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3027,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Conroy, busy with his bag, had not heard. Miss Henschil stared across,"
3028,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"and her beauty, freed from the shadow of any fear, blazed up within her."
3029,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'I see what you mean,' she said. 'But it hasn't changed anything. I want"
3030,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Toots. _He_ has never been out of his mind in his life--except over
3031,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,silly me.'
3032,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3033,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'It's all right,' said Conroy, stooping under the lamp,"
3034,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Bradshaw in hand. 'If I change at Templecombe--for Bristol
3035,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,(Bristol--Hereford--yes)--I can be with mother for breakfast in her room
3036,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,and find out.'
3037,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3038,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Quick, then,' said Nurse Blaber. 'We've passed Gillingham quite a"
3039,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,while. You'd better take some of our sandwiches.' She went out to get
3040,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"them. Conroy and Miss Henschil would have danced, but there is no room"
3041,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,for giants in a South-Western compartment.
3042,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3043,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Good-bye, good luck, lad. Eh, but you've changed already--like me. Send"
3044,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"a wire to our hotel as soon as you're sure,' said Miss Henschil. 'What"
3045,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,should I have done without you?'
3046,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3047,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,'Or I?' said Conroy. 'But it's Nurse that's saving us really.'
3048,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3049,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Then thank her,' said Miss Henschil, looking straight at him. 'Yes, I"
3050,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,would. She'd like it.'
3051,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3052,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,When Nurse Blaber came back after the parting at Templecombe her nose
3053,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"and her eyelids were red, but, for all that, her face reflected a great"
3054,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,light even while she sniffed over _The Cloister and the Hearth_.
3055,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3056,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Miss Henschil, deep in a house furnisher's catalogue, did not speak for"
3057,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"twenty minutes. Then she said, between adding totals of best, guest, and"
3058,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"servants' sheets, 'But why should our times have been the same, Nursey?'"
3059,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3060,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Because a child is born somewhere every second of the clock,' Nurse"
3061,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"Blaber answered. 'And besides that, you probably set each other off by"
3062,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"talking and thinking about it. You shouldn't, you know.'"
3063,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3064,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'Ay, but you've never been in Hell,' said Miss Henschil."
3065,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3066,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,The telegram handed in at Hereford at 12.46 and delivered to Miss
3067,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Henschil on the beach of a certain village at 2.7 ran thus:
3068,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3069,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'""_Absolutely confirmed. She says she remembers hearing noise of"
3070,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"accident in engine-room returning from India eighty-five._""'"
3071,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3072,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'He means the year, not the thermometer,' said Nurse Blaber, throwing"
3073,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,pebbles at the cold sea.
3074,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3075,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'""_And two men scalded thus explaining my hoots._"" (The idea of telling"
3076,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"me that!) ""_Subsequently silly clergyman passenger ran up behind her"
3077,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"calling for joke, 'Friend, all is lost,' thus accounting very words._""'"
3078,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3079,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,Nurse Blaber purred audibly.
3080,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3081,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'""_She says only remembers being upset minute or two. Unspeakable"
3082,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"relief. Best love Nursey, who is jewel. Get out of her what she would"
3083,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"like best._"" Oh, I oughtn't to have read that,' said Miss Henschil."
3084,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,
3085,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,"'It doesn't matter. I don't want anything,' said Nurse Blaber, 'and if I"
3086,L. RUTHERFORD GILBERT.,did I shouldn't get it.'

3151,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3152,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Then I found Lieutenant-Colonel A.L. Corkran, I.A., who borrowed a"

3155,'HELEN ALL ALONE','And are your subalterns as good as ever?' I asked.
3156,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3157,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Amazin'--simply amazin'! All I've got to do is to find 'em jobs. They
3158,'HELEN ALL ALONE',keep touchin' their caps to me and askin' for more work. 'Come at me

3174,'HELEN ALL ALONE',D'you remember--'
3175,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3176,'HELEN ALL ALONE',We remembered together till close on seven o'clock. As we went out into
3177,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"the gallery that runs round the big hall, we saw The Infant, below,"
3178,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"talking to two deferential well-set-up lads whom I had known, on and"
3179,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"off, in the holidays, any time for the last ten years. One of them had a"
3180,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"bruised cheek, and the other a weeping left eye."
3181,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3182,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Yes, that's the style,' said Stalky below his breath. 'They're brought"
3183,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"up on lemon-squash and mobilisation text-books. I say, the girls we knew"
3184,'HELEN ALL ALONE',must have been much better than they pretended they were; for I'll swear
3185,'HELEN ALL ALONE',it isn't the fathers.'
3186,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3187,'HELEN ALL ALONE','But why on earth did you do it?' The Infant was shouting. 'You know
3188,'HELEN ALL ALONE',what it means nowadays.'
3189,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3190,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Well, sir,' said Bobby Trivett, the taller of the two, 'Wontner talks"
3191,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"too much, for one thing. He didn't join till he was twenty-three, and,"
3192,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"besides that, he used to lecture on tactics in the ante-room. He said"
3193,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Clausewitz was the only tactician, and he illustrated his theories with"
3194,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"cigar-ends. He was that sort of chap, sir.'"
3195,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3196,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'And he didn't much care whose cigar-ends they were,' said Eames, who"
3197,'HELEN ALL ALONE',was shorter and pinker.
3198,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3199,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'And then he _would_ talk about the 'Varsity,' said Bobby. 'He got a"
3200,'HELEN ALL ALONE',degree there. And he told us we weren't intellectual. He told the
3201,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Adjutant so, sir. He was just that kind of chap, sir, if you"
3202,'HELEN ALL ALONE',understand.'
3203,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3204,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Stalky and I backed behind a tall Japanese jar of chrysanthemums and
3205,'HELEN ALL ALONE',listened more intently.
3206,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3207,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Was all the Mess in it, or only you two?' The Infant demanded, chewing"
3208,'HELEN ALL ALONE',his moustache.
3209,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3210,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'The Adjutant went to bed, of course, sir, and the Senior Subaltern said"
3211,'HELEN ALL ALONE',he wasn't going to risk his commission--they're awfully down on ragging
3212,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"nowadays in the Service--but the rest of us--er--attended to him,'"
3213,'HELEN ALL ALONE',said Bobby.
3214,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3215,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Much?' The Infant asked. The boys smiled deprecatingly.
3216,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3217,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Not in the ante-room, sir,' said Eames. 'Then he called us silly"
3218,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"children, and went to bed, and we sat up discussin', and I suppose we"
3219,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"got a bit above ourselves, and we--er--'"
3220,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3221,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Went to his quarters and drew him?' The Infant suggested.
3222,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3223,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Well, we only asked him to get out of bed, and we put his helmet and"
3224,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"sword-belt on for him, and we sung him bits out of the Blue Fairy"
3225,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Book--the cram-book on Army organisation. Oh yes, and then we asked him"
3226,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"to drink old Clausewitz's health, as a brother-tactician, in milk-punch"
3227,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"and Worcester sauce, and so on. We had to help him a little there. He"
3228,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"bites. There wasn't much else that time; but, you know, the War Office"
3229,'HELEN ALL ALONE',is severe on ragging these days.' Bobby stopped with a lopsided smile.
3230,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3231,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'And then,' Eames went on, 'then Wontner said we'd done several pounds'"
3232,'HELEN ALL ALONE',worth of damage to his furniture.'
3233,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3234,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh,' said The Infant, 'he's that kind of man, is he? Does he brush his"
3235,'HELEN ALL ALONE',teeth?'
3236,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3237,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh yes, he's quite clean all over!' said Trivett; 'but his father's a"
3238,'HELEN ALL ALONE',wealthy barrister.'
3239,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3240,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Solicitor,' Eames corrected, 'and so this Mister Wontner is out for our"
3241,'HELEN ALL ALONE',blood. He's going to make a first-class row about it--appeal to the War
3242,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Office--court of inquiry--spicy bits in the papers, and songs in the"
3243,'HELEN ALL ALONE',music-halls. He told us so.'
3244,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3245,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'That's the sort of chap he is,' said Trivett. 'And that means old"
3246,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Dhurrah-bags, our Colonel, 'll be put on half-pay, same as that case in"
3247,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"the Scarifungers' Mess; and our Adjutant'll have to exchange, like it"
3248,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"was with that fellow in the 73rd Dragoons, and there'll be misery all"
3249,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"round. He means making it too hot for us, and his papa'll back him.'"
3250,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3251,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Yes, that's all very fine,' said The Infant; 'but I left the Service"
3252,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"about the time you were born, Bobby. What's it got to do with me?'"
3253,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3254,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Father told me I was always to go to you when I was in trouble, and"
3255,'HELEN ALL ALONE',you've been awfully good to me since he ...'
3256,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3257,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Better stay to dinner.' The Infant mopped his forehead.
3258,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3259,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Thank you very much, but the fact is--' Trivett halted."
3260,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3261,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'This afternoon, about four, to be exact--' Eames broke in."
3262,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3263,'HELEN ALL ALONE','We went over to Wontner's quarters to talk things over. The row only
3264,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"happened last night, and we found him writing letters as hard as he"
3265,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"could to his father--getting up his case for the War Office, you know."
3266,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"He read us some of 'em, but I'm not a good judge of style. We tried to"
3267,'HELEN ALL ALONE',ride him off quietly--apologies and so forth--but it was the milk-punch
3268,'HELEN ALL ALONE',and mayonnaise that defeated us.'
3269,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3270,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Yes, he wasn't taking anything except pure revenge,' said Eames."
3271,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3272,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'He said he'd make an example of the regiment, and he was particularly"
3273,'HELEN ALL ALONE',glad that he'd landed our Colonel. He told us so. Old Dhurrah-bags don't
3274,'HELEN ALL ALONE',sympathise with Wontner's tactical lectures. He says Wontner ought to
3275,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"learn manners first, but we thought--' Trivett turned to Eames, who was"
3276,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"less a son of the house than himself, Eames's father being still alive."
3277,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3278,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Then,' Eames went on, 'he became rather noisome, and we thought we"
3279,'HELEN ALL ALONE',might as well impound the correspondence'--he wrinkled his swelled left
3280,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"eye--'and after that, we got him to take a seat in my car.'"
3281,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3282,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'He was in a sack, you know,' Trivett explained. 'He wouldn't go any"
3283,'HELEN ALL ALONE',other way. But we didn't hurt him.'
3284,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3285,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh no! His head's sticking out quite clear, and'--Eames rushed the"
3286,'HELEN ALL ALONE',fence--'we've put him in your garage--er _pendente lite_.'
3287,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3288,'HELEN ALL ALONE','My garage!' Infant's voice nearly broke with horror.
3289,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3290,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Well, father always told me if I was in trouble, Uncle George--'"
3291,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3292,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Bobby's sentence died away as The Infant collapsed on a divan and said
3293,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"no more than, 'Your commissions!' There was a long, long silence."
3294,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3295,'HELEN ALL ALONE','What price your latter-day lime-juice subaltern?' I whispered to
3296,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Stalky behind my hand. His nostrils expanded, and he drummed on the edge"
3297,'HELEN ALL ALONE',of the Japanese jar with his knuckles.
3298,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3299,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Confound your father, Bobby!' The Infant groaned. 'Raggin's a criminal"
3300,'HELEN ALL ALONE',offence these days. It isn't as if--'
3301,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3302,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Come on,' said Stalky. 'That was my old Line battalion in Egypt. They"
3303,'HELEN ALL ALONE',nearly slung old Dhurrah-bags and me out of the Service in '85 for
3304,'HELEN ALL ALONE',ragging.' He descended the stairs and The Infant rolled appealing
3305,'HELEN ALL ALONE',eyes at him.
3306,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3307,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I heard what you youngsters have confessed,' he began; and in his"
3308,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"orderly-room voice, which is almost as musical as his singing one, he"
3309,'HELEN ALL ALONE',tongue-lashed those lads in such sort as was a privilege and a
3310,'HELEN ALL ALONE',revelation to listen to. Till then they had known him almost as a
3311,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"relative--we were all brevet, deputy, or acting uncles to The Infant's"
3312,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"friends' brood--a sympathetic elder brother, sound on finance. They had"
3313,'HELEN ALL ALONE',never met Colonel A.L. Corkran in the Chair of Justice. And while he
3314,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"flayed and rent and blistered, and wiped the floor with them, and while"
3315,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"they looked for hiding-places and found none on that floor, I remembered"
3316,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"(1) the up-ending of 'Dolly' Macshane at Dalhousie, which came"
3317,'HELEN ALL ALONE',perilously near a court-martial on Second-Lieutenant Corkran; (2) the
3318,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"burning of Captain Parmilee's mosquito-curtains on a hot Indian dawn,"
3319,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"when the captain slept in his garden, and Lieutenant Corkran, smoking,"
3320,'HELEN ALL ALONE',rode by after a successful whist night at the club; (3) the
3321,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"introduction of an ekka pony, with ekka attached, into a brother"
3322,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"captain's tent on a frosty night in Peshawur, and the removal of tent,"
3323,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"pole, cot, and captain all wrapped in chilly canvas; (4) the bath that"
3324,'HELEN ALL ALONE',was given to Elliot-Hacker on his own verandah--his lady-love saw it and
3325,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"broke off the engagement, which was what the Mess intended, she being an"
3326,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Eurasian--and the powdering all over of Elliot-Hacker with flour and
3327,'HELEN ALL ALONE',turmeric from the bazaar.
3328,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3329,'HELEN ALL ALONE',When he took breath I realised how only Satan can rebuke sin. The good
3330,'HELEN ALL ALONE',don't know enough.
3331,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3332,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Now,' said Stalky, 'get out! No, not out of the house. Go to your"
3333,'HELEN ALL ALONE',rooms.'
3334,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3335,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'll send your dinner, Bobby,' said The Infant. 'Ipps!'"
3336,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3337,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Nothing had ever been known to astonish Ipps, the butler. He entered and"
3338,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"withdrew with his charges. After all, he had suffered from Bobby since"
3339,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Bobby's twelfth year.
3340,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3341,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'They've done everything they could, short of murder,' said The Infant."
3342,'HELEN ALL ALONE','You know what this'll mean for the regiment. It isn't as if we were
3343,'HELEN ALL ALONE',dealing with Sahibs nowadays.'
3344,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3345,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Quite so.' Stalky turned on me. 'Go and release the bagman,' he said."
3346,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3347,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"''Tisn't my garage,' I pleaded. 'I'm company. Besides, he'll probably"
3348,'HELEN ALL ALONE',slay me. He's been in the sack for hours.'
3349,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3350,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Look here,' Stalky thundered--the years had fallen from us both--'is"
3351,'HELEN ALL ALONE',your--am I commandin' or are you? We've got to pull this thing off
3352,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"somehow or other. Cut over to the garage, make much of him, and bring"
3353,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"him over. He's dining with us. Be quick, you dithering ass!'"
3354,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3355,'HELEN ALL ALONE',I was quick enough; but as I ran through the shrubbery I wondered how
3356,'HELEN ALL ALONE',one extricates the subaltern of the present day from a sack without
3357,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"hurting his feelings. Anciently, one slit the end open, taking off his"
3358,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"boots first, and then fled."
3359,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3360,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Imagine a sumptuously-equipped garage, half-filled by The Infant's"
3361,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"cobalt-blue, grey-corded silk limousine and a mud-splashed, cheap,"
3362,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"hooded four-seater. In the back seat of this last, conceive a fiery"
3363,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"chestnut head emerging from a long oat-sack; an implacable white face,"
3364,'HELEN ALL ALONE',with blazing eyes and jaws that worked ceaselessly at the loop of the
3365,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"string that was drawn round its neck. The effect, under the electrics,"
3366,'HELEN ALL ALONE',was that of a demon caterpillar wrathfully spinning its own cocoon.
3367,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3368,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Good evening!' I said genially. 'Let me help you out of that.' The head
3369,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"glared. 'We've got 'em,' I went on. 'They came to quite the wrong shop"
3370,'HELEN ALL ALONE',for this sort of game--quite the wrong shop.'
3371,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3372,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Game!' said the head. 'We'll see about that. Let me out.'
3373,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3374,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"It was not a promising voice for one so young, and, as usual, I had no"
3375,'HELEN ALL ALONE',knife.
3376,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3377,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'You've chewed the string so I can't find the knot,' I said as I worked"
3378,'HELEN ALL ALONE',with trembling fingers at the cater-pillar's throat. Something untied
3379,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"itself, and Mr. Wontner wriggled out, collarless, tieless, his coat"
3380,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"split half down his back, his waistcoat unbuttoned, his watch-chain"
3381,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"snapped, his trousers rucked well above the knees."
3382,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3383,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Where,' he said grimly, as he pulled them down, 'are Master Trivett and"
3384,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Master Eames?'
3385,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3386,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Both arrested, of course,' I replied. 'Sir George'--I gave The Infant's"
3387,'HELEN ALL ALONE',full title as a baronet--'is a Justice of the Peace. He'd be very
3388,'HELEN ALL ALONE',pleased if you dined with us. There's a room ready for you.' I picked
3389,'HELEN ALL ALONE',up the sack.
3390,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3391,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'D'you know,' said Mr. Wontner through his teeth--but the car's bonnet"
3392,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"was between us, 'that this looks to me like--I won't say conspiracy"
3393,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"_yet_, but uncommonly like a confederacy.'"
3394,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3395,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"When injured souls begin to distinguish and qualify, danger is over. So"
3396,'HELEN ALL ALONE',I grew bold.
3397,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3398,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"''Sorry you take it that way,' I said. 'You come here in trouble--'"
3399,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3400,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'My good fool,' he interrupted, with a half-hysterical snort, 'let me"
3401,'HELEN ALL ALONE',assure you that the trouble will recoil on the other men!'
3402,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3403,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'As you please,' I went on. 'Anyhow, the chaps who got you into trouble"
3404,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"are arrested, and the magistrate who arrested 'em asks you to dinner."
3405,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Shall I tell him you're walking back to Aldershot?'
3406,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3407,'HELEN ALL ALONE',He picked some fluff off his waistcoat.
3408,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3409,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'm in no position to dictate terms yet,' he said. 'That will come"
3410,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"later. I must probe into this a little further. In the meantime, I"
3411,'HELEN ALL ALONE',accept your invitation without prejudice--if you understand what
3412,'HELEN ALL ALONE',that means.'
3413,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3414,'HELEN ALL ALONE',I understood and began to be happy again. Sub-alterns without
3415,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"prejudices were quite new to me. 'All right,' I replied; 'if you'll go"
3416,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"up to the house, I'll turn out the lights.'"
3417,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3418,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"He walked off stiffly, while I searched the sack and the car for the"
3419,'HELEN ALL ALONE',impounded correspondence that Bobby had talked of. I found nothing
3420,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"except, as the police reports say, the trace of a struggle. He had"
3421,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"kicked half the varnish off the back of the front seat, and had bitten"
3422,'HELEN ALL ALONE',the leather padding where he could reach it. Evidently a purposeful and
3423,'HELEN ALL ALONE',hard-mouthed young gentleman.
3424,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3425,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Well done!' said Stalky at the door. 'So he didn't slay you. Stop
3426,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"laughing. He's talking to The Infant now about depositions. Look here,"
3427,'HELEN ALL ALONE',you're nearest his size. Cut up to your rooms and give Ipps your dinner
3428,'HELEN ALL ALONE',things and a clean shirt for him.'
3429,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3430,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'But I haven't got another suit,' I said."
3431,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3432,'HELEN ALL ALONE','You! I'm not thinking of you! We've got to conciliate _him_. He's in
3433,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"filthy rags and a filthy temper, and he won't feel decent till he's"
3434,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"dressed. You're the sacrifice. Be quick! And clean socks, remember!'"
3435,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3436,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Once more I trotted up to my room, changed into unseasonable unbrushed"
3437,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"grey tweeds, put studs into a clean shirt, dug out fresh socks, handed"
3438,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"the whole garniture over to Ipps, and returned to the hall just in time"
3439,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"to hear Stalky say, 'I'm a stockbroker, but I have the honour to hold"
3440,'HELEN ALL ALONE',His Majesty's commission in a Territorial battalion.' Then I felt as
3441,'HELEN ALL ALONE',though I might be beginning to be repaid.
3442,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3443,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I have a very high opinion of the Territorials myself,' said Mr."
3444,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Wontner above a glass of sherry. (Infant never lets us put bitters into
3445,'HELEN ALL ALONE',anything above twenty years old.) 'But if you had any experience of the
3446,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Service, you would find that the Average Army Man--'"
3447,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3448,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Here The Infant suggested changing, and Ipps, before whom no human"
3449,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"passion can assert itself, led Mr. Wontner away."
3450,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3451,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Why the devil did you tell him I was on the Bench?' said Infant
3452,'HELEN ALL ALONE',wrathfully to me. 'You know I ain't now. Why didn't he stay in his
3453,'HELEN ALL ALONE',father's office? He's a raging blight!'
3454,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3455,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Not a bit of it,' said Stalky cheerfully. 'He's a little shaken and"
3456,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"excited. Probably Beetle annoyed him in the garage, but we must overlook"
3457,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"that. We've contained him so far, and I'm going to nibble round his"
3458,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"outposts at dinner. All you've got to do, Infant, is to remember you're"
3459,'HELEN ALL ALONE',a gentleman in your own house. Don't hop! You'll find it pretty
3460,'HELEN ALL ALONE',difficult before dinner's over. I don't want to hear anything at all
3461,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"from you, Beetle.'"
3462,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3463,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'But I'm just beginning to like him,' I said. 'Do let me play!'"
3464,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3465,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Not till I ask you. You'll overdo it. Poor old Dhurrah-bags! A scandal
3466,'HELEN ALL ALONE','ud break him up!'
3467,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3468,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'But as long as a regiment has no say as to who joins it, it's bound to"
3469,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"rag,' Infant began. 'Why--why, they varnished me when I joined!' He"
3470,'HELEN ALL ALONE',squirmed at the thought of it.
3471,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3472,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Don't be owls! We ain't discussing principles! We've got to save the
3473,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"court of inquiry if we can,' said Stalky."
3474,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3475,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Five minutes later--at 7.45 to be precise--we four sat down to such a
3476,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"dinner as, I hold, only The Infant's cook can produce, with wines worthy"
3477,'HELEN ALL ALONE',of pontifical banquets. A man in the extremity of rage and injured
3478,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"dignity is precisely like a typhoid patient. He asks no questions,"
3479,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"accepts what is put before him, and babbles in one key--very often of"
3480,'HELEN ALL ALONE',trifles. But food and drink are the very best of drugs. I think it was
3481,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Heidsieck Dry Monopole '92--Stalky as usual stuck to Burgundy--that
3482,'HELEN ALL ALONE',began to unlock Mr. Wontner's heart behind my shirt-front. Me he snubbed
3483,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"throughout, after the Oxford manner, because I had seen him in the sack,"
3484,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"and he did not intend me to presume; but to Stalky and The Infant, while"
3485,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"I admired the set of my dinner-jacket across his shoulders, he made his"
3486,'HELEN ALL ALONE',plans of revenge very clear indeed. He had even sketched out some of the
3487,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"paragraphs that were to appear in the papers, and if Stalky had allowed"
3488,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"me to speak, I would have told him that they were rather neatly phrased."
3489,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3490,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'You ought to be able to get whackin' damages out of 'em, into the"
3491,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"bargain,' said Stalky, after Mr. Wontner had outlined his"
3492,'HELEN ALL ALONE',position legally.
3493,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3494,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'My de-ah sir,' Mr. Wontner applied himself to his glass, 'it isn't a"
3495,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"matter that gentlemen usually discuss, but, I assure you, we"
3496,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Wontners'--he waved a well-kept hand--'do not stand in any need of
3497,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"filthy lucre.' In the next three minutes, we learned exactly what his"
3498,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"father was worth, which, as he pointed out, was a trifle no man of the"
3499,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"world dwelt on. Stalky envied aloud, and I delivered my first kick at"
3500,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"The Infant's ankle. Thence we drifted to education, and the Average Army"
3501,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Man, and the desolating vacuity--I remember these words--of Army"
3502,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Society, notably among its womenkind. It appeared there was some sort of"
3503,'HELEN ALL ALONE',narrow convention in the Army against mentioning a woman's name at Mess.
3504,'HELEN ALL ALONE',We were much surprised at this--Stalky would not let me express my
3505,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"surprise--but we took it from Mr. Wontner, who said we might, that it"
3506,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"was so. Next he touched on Colonels of the old school, and their"
3507,'HELEN ALL ALONE',cognisance of tactics. Not that he himself pretended to any skill in
3508,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"tactics, but after three years at the 'Varsity--none of us had had a"
3509,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Varsity education--a man insensibly contracted the habit of clear
3510,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"thinking. At least, he could automatically co-ordinate his ideas, and"
3511,'HELEN ALL ALONE',the jealousy of these muddle-headed Colonels was inconceivable. We would
3512,'HELEN ALL ALONE',understand that it was his duty to force on the retirement of his
3513,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Colonel, who had been in the conspiracy against him; to make his"
3514,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Adjutant resign or exchange; and to give the half-dozen childish
3515,'HELEN ALL ALONE',subalterns who had vexed his dignity a chance to retrieve themselves in
3516,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"other corps--West African ones, he hoped. For himself, after the case"
3517,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"was decided, he proposed to go on living in the regiment, just to"
3518,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"prove--for he bore no malice--that times had changed, _nosque mutamur in"
3519,'HELEN ALL ALONE',illis_--if we knew what that meant. Infant had curled his legs out of
3520,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"reach, so I was quite free to return thanks yet once more to Allah for"
3521,'HELEN ALL ALONE',the diversity of His creatures in His adorable world.
3522,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3523,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"And so, by way of an eighty-year-old liqueur brandy, to tactics and the"
3524,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"great General Clausewitz, unknown to the Average Army Man. Here The"
3525,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Infant, at a whisper from Ipps--whose face had darkened like a mulberry"
3526,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"while he waited--excused himself and went away, but Stalky, Colonel of"
3527,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Territorials, wanted some tips on tactics. He got them unbrokenly for"
3528,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"ten minutes--Wontner and Clausewitz mixed, but Wontner in a film of"
3529,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"priceless cognac distinctly on top. When The Infant came back, he"
3530,'HELEN ALL ALONE',renewed his clear-spoken demand that Infant should take his depositions.
3531,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"I supposed this to be a family trait of the Wontners, whom I had been"
3532,'HELEN ALL ALONE',visualising for some time past even to the third generation.
3533,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3534,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'But, hang it all, they're both asleep!' said Infant, scowling at me."
3535,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Ipps let 'em have the '81 port.'
3536,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3537,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Asleep!' said Stalky, rising at once. 'I don't see that makes any"
3538,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"difference. As a matter of form, you'd better identify them. I'll show"
3539,'HELEN ALL ALONE',you the way.'
3540,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3541,'HELEN ALL ALONE',We followed up the white stone side-staircase that leads to the
3542,'HELEN ALL ALONE',bachelors' wing. Mr. Wontner seemed surprised that the boys were not in
3543,'HELEN ALL ALONE',the coal-cellar.
3544,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3545,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh, a chap's assumed to be innocent until he's proved guilty,' said"
3546,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Stalky, mounting step by step. 'How did they get you into the sack,"
3547,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Mr. Wontner?'
3548,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3549,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Jumped on me from behind--two to one,' said Mr. Wontner briefly. 'I"
3550,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"think I handed each of them something first, but they roped my arms"
3551,'HELEN ALL ALONE',and legs.'
3552,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3553,'HELEN ALL ALONE','And did they photograph you in the sack?'
3554,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3555,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Good Heavens, no!' Mr. Wontner shuddered."
3556,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3557,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'That's lucky. Awful thing to live down--a photograph, isn't it?' said"
3558,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Stalky to me as we reached the landing. 'I'm thinking of the newspapers,"
3559,'HELEN ALL ALONE',of course.'
3560,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3561,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh, but you can easily have sketches in the illustrated papers from"
3562,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"accounts supplied by eye-witnesses,' I said."
3563,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3564,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Mr. Wontner turned him round. It was the first time he had honoured me
3565,'HELEN ALL ALONE',by his notice since our talk in the garage.
3566,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3567,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Ah,' said he, 'do you pretend to any special knowledge in these"
3568,'HELEN ALL ALONE',matters?'
3569,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3570,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'm a journalist by profession,' I answered simply but nobly. 'As soon"
3571,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"as you're at liberty, I'd like to have your account of the affair.'"
3572,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3573,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Now I thought he would have loved me for this, but he only replied in an"
3574,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"uncomfortable, uncoming-on voice, 'Oh, you would, would you?'"
3575,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3576,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Not if it's any trouble, of course,' I said. 'I can always get their"
3577,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"version from the defendants. Do either of 'em draw or sketch at all, Mr."
3578,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Wontner? Or perhaps your father might--'
3579,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3580,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Then he said quite hotly, 'I wish you to understand very clearly, my"
3581,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"good man, that a gentleman's name can't be dragged through the gutter to"
3582,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"bolster up the circulation of your wretched sheet, whatever it may be.'"
3583,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3584,'HELEN ALL ALONE','It is ----' I named a journal of enormous sales which specialises in
3585,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"scholastic, military, and other scandals. 'I don't know yet what it"
3586,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"can't do, Mr. Wontner.'"
3587,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3588,'HELEN ALL ALONE','I didn't know that I was dealing with a reporter' said Mr. Wontner.
3589,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3590,'HELEN ALL ALONE',We were all halted outside a shut door. Ipps had followed us.
3591,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3592,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'But surely you want it in the papers, don't you?' I urged. 'With a"
3593,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"scandal like this, one couldn't, in justice to the democracy, be"
3594,'HELEN ALL ALONE',exclusive. We'd syndicate it here and in the United States. I helped you
3595,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"out of the sack, if you remember.'"
3596,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3597,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I wish to goodness you'd stop talking!' he snapped, and sat down on a"
3598,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"chair. Stalky's hand on my shoulder quietly signalled me out of action,"
3599,'HELEN ALL ALONE',but I felt that my fire had not been misdirected.
3600,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3601,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'll answer for him,' said Stalky to Wontner, in an undertone that"
3602,'HELEN ALL ALONE',dropped to a whisper. I caught--'Not without my leave--dependent on me
3603,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"for market-tips,' and other gratifying tributes to my integrity."
3604,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3605,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Still Mr. Wontner sat in his chair, and still we waited on him. The"
3606,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Infant's face showed worry and heavy grief; Stalky's, a bright and"
3607,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"bird-like interest; mine was hidden behind his shoulders, but on the"
3608,'HELEN ALL ALONE',face of Ipps were written emotions that no butler should cherish towards
3609,'HELEN ALL ALONE',any guest. Contempt and wrath were the least of them. And Mr. Wontner
3610,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"was looking full at Ipps, as Ipps was looking at him. Mr. Wontner's"
3611,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"father, I understood, kept a butler and two footmen."
3612,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3613,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'D'you suppose they're shamming, in order to get off?' he said at last."
3614,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Ipps shook his head and noiselessly threw the door open. The boys had
3615,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"finished their dinner and were fast asleep--one on a sofa, one in a long"
3616,'HELEN ALL ALONE',chair--their faces fallen back to the lines of their childhood. They had
3617,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"had a wildish night, a hard day, that ended with a telling-off from an"
3618,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"artist, and the assurance they had wrecked their prospects for life."
3619,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"What else should youth do, then, but eat, and drink '81 port, and"
3620,'HELEN ALL ALONE',remember their sorrows no more?
3621,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3622,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Mr. Wontner looked at them severely, Ipps within easy reach, his hands"
3623,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"quite ready. 'Childish,' said Mr. Wontner at last. 'Childish but"
3624,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"necessary. Er--have you such a thing as a rope on the premises, and a"
3625,'HELEN ALL ALONE',sack--two sacks and two ropes? I'm afraid I can't resist the temptation.
3626,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"That man understands, doesn't he, that this is a private matter?'"
3627,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3628,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'That man,' who was me, was off to the basement like one of Infant's own"
3629,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"fallow-deer. The stables gave me what I wanted, and coming back with it"
3630,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"through a dark passage, I ran squarely into Ipps. 'Go on!' he grunted."
3631,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'The minute he lays hands on Master Bobby, Master Bobby's saved. But"
3632,'HELEN ALL ALONE',that person ought to be told how near he came to being assaulted. It was
3633,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"touch-and-go with me all the time from the soup down, I assure you.'"
3634,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3635,'HELEN ALL ALONE',I arrived breathless with the sacks and the ropes. 'They were two to one
3636,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"with me,' said Mr. Wontner, as he took them. 'If they wake--'"
3637,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3638,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'We'll stand by,' Stalky replied. 'Two to one is quite fair.'"
3639,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3640,'HELEN ALL ALONE',But the boys hardly grunted as Mr. Wontner roped first one and then the
3641,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"other. Even when they were slid into the sacks they only mumbled, with"
3642,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"rolling heads, through sticky lips, and snored on."
3643,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3644,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Port?' said Mr. Wontner virtuously.
3645,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3646,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Nervous exhaustion. They aren't much more than kids, after all. What's"
3647,'HELEN ALL ALONE',next?' said Stalky.
3648,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3649,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I want to take 'em away with me, please.'"
3650,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3651,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Stalky looked at him with respect.
3652,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3653,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'll have my car round in five minutes,' said The Infant. 'Ipps'll help"
3654,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"carry 'em downstairs,' and he shook Mr. Wontner by the hand."
3655,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3656,'HELEN ALL ALONE',We were all perfectly serious till the two bundles were dumped on a
3657,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"divan in the hall, and the boys waked and began to realise what"
3658,'HELEN ALL ALONE',had happened.
3659,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3660,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Yah!' said Mr. Wontner, with the simplicity of twelve years old. 'Who's"
3661,'HELEN ALL ALONE',scored now?' And he sat upon them. The tension broke in a storm of
3662,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"laughter, led, I think, by Ipps."
3663,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3664,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Asinine--absolutely asinine!' said Mr. Wontner, with folded arms from"
3665,'HELEN ALL ALONE',his lively chair. But he drank in the flattery and the fellowship of it
3666,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"all with quite a brainless grin, as we rolled and stamped round him, and"
3667,'HELEN ALL ALONE',wiped the tears from our cheeks.
3668,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3669,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Hang it!' said Bobby Trivett. 'We're defeated!'
3670,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3671,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'By tactics, too,' said Eames. 'I didn't think you knew 'em, Clausewitz."
3672,'HELEN ALL ALONE',It's a fair score. What are you going to do with us?'
3673,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3674,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Take you back to Mess,' said Mr. Wontner."
3675,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3676,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Not like this?'
3677,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3678,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Oh no. Worse--much worse! I haven't begun with you yet. And you
3679,'HELEN ALL ALONE',thought you'd scored! Yah!'
3680,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3681,'HELEN ALL ALONE',They had scored beyond their wildest dream. The man in whose hands it
3682,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"lay to shame them, their Colonel, their Adjutant, their Regiment, and"
3683,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"their Service, had cast away all shadow of his legal rights for the sake"
3684,'HELEN ALL ALONE',of a common or bear-garden rag--such a rag as if it came to the ears of
3685,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"the authorities, would cost him his commission. They were saved, and"
3686,'HELEN ALL ALONE',their saviour was their equal and their brother. So they chaffed and
3687,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"reviled him as such till he again squashed the breath out of them, and"
3688,'HELEN ALL ALONE',we others laughed louder than they.
3689,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3690,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Fall in!' said Stalky when the limousine came round. 'This is the score
3691,'HELEN ALL ALONE',of the century. I wouldn't miss it for a brigade! We shan't be
3692,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"long, Infant!'"
3693,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3694,'HELEN ALL ALONE',I hurried into a coat.
3695,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3696,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Is there any necessity for that reporter-chap to come too?' said Mr.
3697,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Wontner in an unguarded whisper. 'He isn't dressed for one thing.'
3698,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3699,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Bobby and Eames wriggled round to look at the reporter, began a joyous"
3700,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"bellow, and suddenly stopped."
3701,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3702,'HELEN ALL ALONE','What's the matter?' said Wontner with suspicion.
3703,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3704,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Nothing,' said Bobby. 'I die happy, Clausewitz. Take me up tenderly.'"
3705,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3706,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"We packed into the car, bearing our sheaves with us, and for half an"
3707,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"hour, as the cool night-air fanned his thoughtful brow, Mr. Wontner was"
3708,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"quite abreast of himself. Though he said nothing unworthy, he triumphed"
3709,'HELEN ALL ALONE',and trumpeted a little loudly over the sacks. I sat between them on the
3710,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"back seat, and applauded him servilely till he reminded me that what I"
3711,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"had seen and what he had said was not for publication. I hinted, while"
3712,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"the boys plunged with joy inside their trappings, that this might be a"
3713,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"matter for arrangement. 'Then a sovereign shan't part us,' said Mr."
3714,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Wontner cheerily, and both boys fell into lively hysterics. 'I don't see"
3715,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"where the joke comes in for you,' said Mr. Wontner. 'I thought it was my"
3716,'HELEN ALL ALONE',little jokelet to-night.'
3717,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3718,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'No, Clausewitz,' gasped Bobby. 'Some is, but not all. I'll be good now."
3719,'HELEN ALL ALONE',I'll give you my parole till we get to Mess. I wouldn't be out of this
3720,'HELEN ALL ALONE',for a fiver.'
3721,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3722,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Nor me,' said Eames, and he gave his parole to attempt no escape or"
3723,'HELEN ALL ALONE',evasion.
3724,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3725,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Now, I suppose,' said Mr. Wontner largely to Stalky, as we neared the"
3726,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"suburbs of Ash, 'you have a good deal of practical joking on the Stock"
3727,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Exchange, haven't you?'"
3728,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3729,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'And when were you on the Stock Exchange, Uncle Leonard?' piped Bobby,"
3730,'HELEN ALL ALONE',while Eames laid his sobbing head on my shoulder.
3731,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3732,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'm sorry,' said Stalky, 'but the fact is, I command a regiment myself"
3733,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"when I'm at home. Your Colonel knows me, I think.' He gave his name. Mr."
3734,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Wontner seemed to have heard of it. We had to pick Eames off the floor,"
3735,'HELEN ALL ALONE',where he had cast himself from excess of delight.
3736,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3737,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh, Heavens!' said Mr. Wontner after a long pause. 'What have I done?"
3738,'HELEN ALL ALONE',What haven't I done?' We felt the temperature in the car rise as
3739,'HELEN ALL ALONE',he blushed.
3740,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3741,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'You didn't talk tactics, Clausewitz?' said Bobby. 'Oh, say it wasn't"
3742,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"tactics, darling!'"
3743,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3744,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'It was,' said Wontner."
3745,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3746,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Eames was all among our feet again, crying, 'If you don't let me get my"
3747,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"arms up, I'll be sick. Let's hear what you said. Tell us.'"
3748,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3749,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"But Mr. Wontner turned to Stalky. 'It's no good my begging your pardon,"
3750,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"sir, I suppose,' he said."
3751,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3752,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Don't you notice 'em,' said Stalky. 'It was a fair rag all round, and"
3753,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"anyhow, you two youngsters haven't any right to talk tactics. You've"
3754,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"been rolled up, horse, foot, and guns.'"
3755,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3756,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'll make a treaty. If you'll let us go and change presently,' said"
3757,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Bobby, 'I'll promise we won't tell about you, Clausewitz. _You_ talked"
3758,'HELEN ALL ALONE',tactics to Uncle Len? Old Dhurrah-bags will like that. He don't love
3759,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"you, Claus.'"
3760,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3761,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'If I've made one ass of myself, I shall take extra care to make asses"
3762,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"of you!' said Wontner. 'I want to stop, please, at the next milliner's"
3763,'HELEN ALL ALONE',shop on the right. It ought to be close here.'
3764,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3765,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"He evidently knew the country even in the dark, for the car stopped at a"
3766,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"brilliantly-lighted millinery establishment, where--it was Saturday"
3767,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"evening--a young lady was clearing up the counter. I followed him, as a"
3768,'HELEN ALL ALONE',good reporter should.
3769,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3770,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Have you got--' he began. 'Ah, those'll do!' He pointed to two hairy"
3771,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"plush beehive bonnets, one magenta, the other a conscientious electric"
3772,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"blue. 'How much, please? I'll take them both, and that bunch of peacock"
3773,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"feathers, and that red feather thing.' It was a brilliant crimson-dyed"
3774,'HELEN ALL ALONE',pigeon's wing.
3775,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3776,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Now I want some yards of muslin with a nice, fierce pattern, please.'"
3777,'HELEN ALL ALONE',He got it--yellow with black tulips--and returned heavily laden.
3778,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3779,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Sorry to have kept you,' said he. 'Now we'll go to my quarters to"
3780,'HELEN ALL ALONE',change and beautify.'
3781,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3782,'HELEN ALL ALONE',We came to them--opposite a dun waste of parade-ground that might have
3783,'HELEN ALL ALONE',been Mian Mir--and bugles as they blew and drums as they rolled set
3784,'HELEN ALL ALONE',heart-strings echoing.
3785,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3786,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"We hoisted the boys out and arranged them on chairs, while Wontner"
3787,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"changed into uniform, but stopped when he saw me taking off my jacket."
3788,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3789,'HELEN ALL ALONE','What on earth's that for?' said he.
3790,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3791,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Because you've been wearing my evening things,' I said. 'I want to get"
3792,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"into 'em again, if you don't mind.'"
3793,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3794,'HELEN ALL ALONE','Then you aren't a reporter?' he said.
3795,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3796,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'No,' I said, 'but that shan't part us.'"
3797,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3798,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh, hurry!' cried Eames in desperate convulsions. 'We can't stand this"
3799,'HELEN ALL ALONE',much longer. 'Tisn't fair on the young.'
3800,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3801,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I'll attend to you in good time,' said Wontner; and when he had made"
3802,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"careful toilet, he unwrapped the bonnets, put the peacock's feather into"
3803,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"the magenta one, pinned the crimson wing on the blue one, set them"
3804,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"daintily on the boys' heads, and bade them admire the effect in his"
3805,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"shaving-glass while he ripped the muslin into lengths, bound it first,"
3806,'HELEN ALL ALONE',and draped it artistically afterwards a little below their knees. He
3807,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"finished off with a gigantic sash-bow, obi fashion. 'Hobble skirts,' he"
3808,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"explained to Stalky, who nodded approval."
3809,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3810,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Next he split open the bottom of each sack so that they could walk, but"
3811,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"with very short steps. 'I ought to have got you white satin slippers,'"
3812,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"he murmured, 'and I'm sorry there's no rouge.'"
3813,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3814,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Don't worry on our account, old man--you're doing us proud,' said Bobby"
3815,'HELEN ALL ALONE',from under his hat. 'This beats milk-punch and mayonnaise.'
3816,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3817,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Oh, why didn't we think of these things when we had him at our mercy?'"
3818,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Eames wailed. 'Never mind--we'll try it on the next chap. You've a
3819,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"mind, Claus.'"
3820,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3821,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Now we'll call on 'em at Mess,' said Wontner, as they minced towards"
3822,'HELEN ALL ALONE',the door.
3823,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3824,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'I think I'll call on your Colonel,' said Stalky. 'He oughtn't to miss"
3825,'HELEN ALL ALONE',this. Your first attempt? I assure you I couldn't have done it better
3826,'HELEN ALL ALONE',myself. Thank you!' He held out his hand.
3827,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3828,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Thank _you_, sir!' said Wontner, shaking it. 'I'm more grateful to you"
3829,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"than I can say, and--and I'd like you to believe some time that I'm not"
3830,'HELEN ALL ALONE',quite as big a--'
3831,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3832,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"'Not in the least,' Stalky interrupted. 'If I were writing a"
3833,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"confidential report on you, I should put you down as rather adequate."
3834,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Look after your geishas, or they'll fall!'"
3835,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3836,'HELEN ALL ALONE',We watched the three cross the road and disappear into the shadow of the
3837,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"Mess verandah. There was a noise. Then telephone bells rang, a sergeant"
3838,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"and a Mess waiter charged out, and the noise grew, till at last the Mess"
3839,'HELEN ALL ALONE',was a little noisy.
3840,'HELEN ALL ALONE',
3841,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"We came back, ten minutes later, with Colonel Dalziell, who had been"
3842,'HELEN ALL ALONE',taking his sorrows to bed with him. The ante-room was quite full and
3843,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"visitors were still arriving, but it was possible to hear oneself speak"
3844,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"occasionally. Trivett and Eames, in sack and sash, sat side by side on a"
3845,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"table, their hats at a ravishing angle, coquettishly twiddling their"
3846,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"tied feet. In the intervals of singing 'Put Me Among the Girls,' they"
3847,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"sipped whisky-and-soda held to their lips by, I regret to say, a Major."
3848,'HELEN ALL ALONE',Public opinion seemed to be against allowing them to change their
3849,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"costume till they should have danced in it. Wontner, lying more or less"
3850,'HELEN ALL ALONE',"gracefully at the level of the chandelier in the arms of six subalterns,"

3883,THE CHILDREN,The first felon-stroke of the sword he had long-time
3884,THE CHILDREN,prepared for us--
3885,THE CHILDREN,Their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences.
3886,THE CHILDREN,
3887,THE CHILDREN,"They bought us anew with their blood, forbearing to blame us,"
3888,THE CHILDREN,Those hours which we had not made good when the Judgment

3914,THE CHILDREN,(April 1914)
3915,THE CHILDREN,
3916,THE CHILDREN,"My friend Attley, who would give away his own head if you told him you"
3917,THE CHILDREN,"had lost yours, was giving away a six-months-old litter of Bettina's"
3918,THE CHILDREN,"pups, and half-a-dozen women were in raptures at the show on"
3919,THE CHILDREN,Mittleham lawn.
3920,THE CHILDREN,
3921,THE CHILDREN,"We picked by lot. Mrs. Godfrey drew first choice; her married daughter,"
3922,THE CHILDREN,"second. I was third, but waived my right because I was already owned by"
3923,THE CHILDREN,"Malachi, Bettina's full brother, whom I had brought over in the car to"
3924,THE CHILDREN,"visit his nephews and nieces, and he would have slain them all if I had"
3925,THE CHILDREN,"taken home one. Milly, Mrs. Godfrey's younger daughter, pounced on my"
3926,THE CHILDREN,"rejection with squeals of delight, and Attley turned to a dark,"
3927,THE CHILDREN,"sallow-skinned, slack-mouthed girl, who had come over for tennis, and"
3928,THE CHILDREN,invited her to pick. She put on a pince-nez that made her look like a
3929,THE CHILDREN,"camel, knelt clumsily, for she was long from the hip to the knee,"
3930,THE CHILDREN,"breathed hard, and considered the last couple."
3931,THE CHILDREN,
3932,THE CHILDREN,"'I think I'd like that sandy-pied one,' she said."
3933,THE CHILDREN,
3934,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, not him, Miss Sichliffe!' Attley cried. 'He was overlaid or had"
3935,THE CHILDREN,sunstroke or something. They call him The Looney in the kennels.
3936,THE CHILDREN,"Besides, he squints.'"
3937,THE CHILDREN,
3938,THE CHILDREN,"'I think that's rather fetching,' she answered. Neither Malachi nor I"
3939,THE CHILDREN,had ever seen a squinting dog before.
3940,THE CHILDREN,
3941,THE CHILDREN,"'That's chorea--St. Vitus's dance,' Mrs. Godfrey put in. 'He ought to"
3942,THE CHILDREN,have been drowned.'
3943,THE CHILDREN,
3944,THE CHILDREN,"'But I like his cast of countenance,' the girl persisted."
3945,THE CHILDREN,
3946,THE CHILDREN,"'He doesn't look a good life,' I said, 'but perhaps he can be patched"
3947,THE CHILDREN,up.' Miss Sichliffe turned crimson; I saw Mrs. Godfrey exchange a glance
3948,THE CHILDREN,"with her married daughter, and knew I had said something which would"
3949,THE CHILDREN,have to be lived down.
3950,THE CHILDREN,
3951,THE CHILDREN,"'Yes,' Miss Sichliffe went on, her voice shaking, 'he isn't a good life,"
3952,THE CHILDREN,"but perhaps I can--patch him up. Come here, sir.' The misshapen beast"
3953,THE CHILDREN,"lurched toward her, squinting down his own nose till he fell over his"
3954,THE CHILDREN,"own toes. Then, luckily, Bettina ran across the lawn and reminded"
3955,THE CHILDREN,Malachi of their puppyhood. All that family are as queer as Dick's
3956,THE CHILDREN,"hatband, and fight like man and wife. I had to separate them, and Mrs."
3957,THE CHILDREN,Godfrey helped me till they retired under the rhododendrons and had it
3958,THE CHILDREN,out in silence.
3959,THE CHILDREN,
3960,THE CHILDREN,'D'you know what that girl's father was?' Mrs. Godfrey asked.
3961,THE CHILDREN,
3962,THE CHILDREN,"'No,' I replied. 'I loathe her for her own sake. She breathes through"
3963,THE CHILDREN,her mouth.'
3964,THE CHILDREN,
3965,THE CHILDREN,"'He was a retired doctor,' she explained. 'He used to pick up stormy"
3966,THE CHILDREN,"young men in the repentant stage, take them home, and patch them up till"
3967,THE CHILDREN,"they were sound enough to be insured. Then he insured them heavily, and"
3968,THE CHILDREN,"let them out into the world again--with an appetite. Of course, no one"
3969,THE CHILDREN,"knew him while he was alive, but he left pots of money to his daughter.'"
3970,THE CHILDREN,
3971,THE CHILDREN,"'Strictly legitimate--highly respectable,' I said. 'But what a life for"
3972,THE CHILDREN,the daughter!'
3973,THE CHILDREN,
3974,THE CHILDREN,'Mustn't it have been! _Now_ d'you realise what you said just now?'
3975,THE CHILDREN,
3976,THE CHILDREN,"'Perfectly; and now you've made me quite happy, shall we go back to the"
3977,THE CHILDREN,house?'
3978,THE CHILDREN,
3979,THE CHILDREN,"When we reached it they were all inside, sitting in committee on names."
3980,THE CHILDREN,
3981,THE CHILDREN,'What shall you call yours?' I heard Milly ask Miss Sichliffe.
3982,THE CHILDREN,
3983,THE CHILDREN,"'Harvey,' she replied--'Harvey's Sauce, you know. He's going to be quite"
3984,THE CHILDREN,saucy when I've'--she saw Mrs. Godfrey and me coming through the French
3985,THE CHILDREN,window--'when he's stronger.'
3986,THE CHILDREN,
3987,THE CHILDREN,"Attley, the well-meaning man, to make me feel at ease, asked what I"
3988,THE CHILDREN,thought of the name.
3989,THE CHILDREN,
3990,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, splendid,' I said at random. 'H with an A, A with an R, R with a--'"
3991,THE CHILDREN,
3992,THE CHILDREN,"'But that's Little Bingo,' some one said, and they all laughed."
3993,THE CHILDREN,
3994,THE CHILDREN,"Miss Sichliffe, her hands joined across her long knees, drawled, 'You"
3995,THE CHILDREN,ought always to verify your quotations.'
3996,THE CHILDREN,
3997,THE CHILDREN,"It was not a kindly thrust, but something in the word 'quotation' set"
3998,THE CHILDREN,the automatic side of my brain at work on some shadow of a word or
3999,THE CHILDREN,phrase that kept itself out of memory's reach as a cat sits just beyond
4000,THE CHILDREN,"a dog's jump. When I was going home, Miss Sichliffe came up to me in the"
4001,THE CHILDREN,"twilight, the pup on a leash, swinging her big shoes at the end of her"
4002,THE CHILDREN,tennis-racket.
4003,THE CHILDREN,
4004,THE CHILDREN,"''Sorry,' she said in her thick schoolboy-like voice. 'I'm sorry for"
4005,THE CHILDREN,what I said to you about verifying quotations. I didn't know you well
4006,THE CHILDREN,"enough and--anyhow, I oughtn't to have.'"
4007,THE CHILDREN,
4008,THE CHILDREN,"'But you were quite right about Little Bingo,' I answered. 'The spelling"
4009,THE CHILDREN,ought to have reminded me.'
4010,THE CHILDREN,
4011,THE CHILDREN,"'Yes, of course. It's the spelling,' she said, and slouched off with the"
4012,THE CHILDREN,pup sliding after her. Once again my brain began to worry after
4013,THE CHILDREN,something that would have meant something if it had been properly
4014,THE CHILDREN,"spelled. I confided my trouble to Malachi on the way home, but Bettina"
4015,THE CHILDREN,"had bitten him in four places, and he was busy."
4016,THE CHILDREN,
4017,THE CHILDREN,"Weeks later, Attley came over to see me, and before his car stopped"
4018,THE CHILDREN,Malachi let me know that Bettina was sitting beside the chauffeur. He
4019,THE CHILDREN,greeted her by the scruff of the neck as she hopped down; and I greeted
4020,THE CHILDREN,"Mrs. Godfrey, Attley, and a big basket."
4021,THE CHILDREN,
4022,THE CHILDREN,"'You've got to help me,' said Attley tiredly. We took the basket into"
4023,THE CHILDREN,"the garden, and there staggered out the angular shadow of a sandy-pied,"
4024,THE CHILDREN,"broken-haired terrier, with one imbecile and one delirious ear, and two"
4025,THE CHILDREN,"most hideous squints. Bettina and Malachi, already at grips on the lawn,"
4026,THE CHILDREN,"saw him, let go, and fled in opposite directions."
4027,THE CHILDREN,
4028,THE CHILDREN,'Why have you brought that fetid hound here?' I demanded.
4029,THE CHILDREN,
4030,THE CHILDREN,"'Harvey? For you to take care of,' said Attley. 'He's had distemper, but"
4031,THE CHILDREN,_I_'m going abroad.'
4032,THE CHILDREN,
4033,THE CHILDREN,'Take him with you. I won't have him. He's mentally afflicted.'
4034,THE CHILDREN,
4035,THE CHILDREN,"'Look here,' Attley almost shouted, 'do I strike you as a fool?'"
4036,THE CHILDREN,
4037,THE CHILDREN,"'Always,' said I."
4038,THE CHILDREN,
4039,THE CHILDREN,"'Well, then, if you say so, and Ella says so, that proves I ought to go"
4040,THE CHILDREN,abroad.'
4041,THE CHILDREN,
4042,THE CHILDREN,"'Will's wrong, quite wrong,' Mrs. Godfrey interrupted; 'but you must"
4043,THE CHILDREN,take the pup.'
4044,THE CHILDREN,
4045,THE CHILDREN,"'My dear boy, my dear boy, don't you ever give anything to a woman,'"
4046,THE CHILDREN,Attley snorted.
4047,THE CHILDREN,
4048,THE CHILDREN,Bit by bit I got the story out of them in the quiet garden (never a sign
4049,THE CHILDREN,"from Bettina and Malachi), while Harvey stared me out of countenance,"
4050,THE CHILDREN,first with one cuttlefish eye and then with the other.
4051,THE CHILDREN,
4052,THE CHILDREN,"It appeared that, a month after Miss Sichliffe took him, the dog Harvey"
4053,THE CHILDREN,developed distemper. Miss Sichliffe had nursed him herself for some
4054,THE CHILDREN,"time; then she carried him in her arms the two miles to Mittleham, and"
4055,THE CHILDREN,"wept--actually wept--at Attley's feet, saying that Harvey was all she"
4056,THE CHILDREN,"had or expected to have in this world, and Attley must cure him. Attley,"
4057,THE CHILDREN,"being by wealth, position, and temperament guardian to all lame dogs,"
4058,THE CHILDREN,"had put everything aside for this unsavoury job, and, he asserted, Miss"
4059,THE CHILDREN,Sichliffe had virtually lived with him ever since.
4060,THE CHILDREN,
4061,THE CHILDREN,"'She went home at night, of course,' he exploded, 'but the rest of the"
4062,THE CHILDREN,"time she simply infested the premises. Goodness knows, I'm not"
4063,THE CHILDREN,"particular, but it was a scandal. Even the servants!... Three and four"
4064,THE CHILDREN,"times a day, and notes in between, to know how the beast was. Hang it"
4065,THE CHILDREN,"all, don't laugh! And wanting to send me flowers and goldfish. Do I look"
4066,THE CHILDREN,as if I wanted goldfish? Can't you two stop for a minute?' (Mrs. Godfrey
4067,THE CHILDREN,and I were clinging to each other for support.) 'And it isn't as if I
4068,THE CHILDREN,"was--was so alluring a personality, is it?'"
4069,THE CHILDREN,
4070,THE CHILDREN,"Attley commands more trust, goodwill, and affection than most men, for"
4071,THE CHILDREN,"he is that rare angel, an absolutely unselfish bachelor, content to be"
4072,THE CHILDREN,run by contending syndicates of zealous friends. His situation seemed
4073,THE CHILDREN,"desperate, and I told him so."
4074,THE CHILDREN,
4075,THE CHILDREN,"'Instant flight is your only remedy,' was my verdict. I'll take care of"
4076,THE CHILDREN,"both your cars while you're away, and you can send me over all the"
4077,THE CHILDREN,greenhouse fruit.'
4078,THE CHILDREN,
4079,THE CHILDREN,'But why should I be chased out of my house by a she-dromedary?' he
4080,THE CHILDREN,wailed.
4081,THE CHILDREN,
4082,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, stop! Stop!' Mrs. Godfrey sobbed. 'You're both wrong. I admit"
4083,THE CHILDREN,"you're right, but I _know_ you're wrong.'"
4084,THE CHILDREN,
4085,THE CHILDREN,"'Three _and_ four times a day,' said Attley, with an awful countenance."
4086,THE CHILDREN,"'I'm not a vain man, but--look here, Ella, I'm not sensitive, I hope,"
4087,THE CHILDREN,but if you persist in making a joke of it--'
4088,THE CHILDREN,
4089,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, be quiet!' she almost shrieked. 'D'you imagine for one instant that"
4090,THE CHILDREN,your friends would ever let Mittleham pass out of their hands? I quite
4091,THE CHILDREN,agree it is unseemly for a grown girl to come to Mittleham at all hours
4092,THE CHILDREN,of the day and night--'
4093,THE CHILDREN,
4094,THE CHILDREN,"'I told you she went home o' nights,' Attley growled."
4095,THE CHILDREN,
4096,THE CHILDREN,"'Specially if she goes home o' nights. Oh, but think of the life she"
4097,THE CHILDREN,"must have led, Will!'"
4098,THE CHILDREN,
4099,THE CHILDREN,'I'm not interfering with it; only she must leave me alone.'
4100,THE CHILDREN,
4101,THE CHILDREN,"'She may want to patch you up and insure you,' I suggested."
4102,THE CHILDREN,
4103,THE CHILDREN,'D'you know what _you_ are?' Mrs. Godfrey turned on me with the smile I
4104,THE CHILDREN,"have feared for the last quarter of a century. 'You're the nice, kind,"
4105,THE CHILDREN,"wise, doggy friend. You don't know how wise and nice you are supposed to"
4106,THE CHILDREN,be. Will has sent Harvey to you to complete the poor angel's
4107,THE CHILDREN,"convalescence. You know all about dogs, or Will wouldn't have done it."
4108,THE CHILDREN,He's written her that. You're too far off for her to make daily calls on
4109,THE CHILDREN,"you. P'r'aps she'll drop in two or three times a week, and write on"
4110,THE CHILDREN,"other days. But it doesn't matter what she does, because you don't own"
4111,THE CHILDREN,"Mittleham, don't you see?'"
4112,THE CHILDREN,
4113,THE CHILDREN,I told her I saw most clearly.
4114,THE CHILDREN,
4115,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, you'll get over that in a few days,' Mrs. Godfrey countered."
4116,THE CHILDREN,"'You're the sporting, responsible, doggy friend who--'"
4117,THE CHILDREN,
4118,THE CHILDREN,"'He used to look at me like that at first,' said Attley, with a visible"
4119,THE CHILDREN,"shudder, 'but he gave it up after a bit. It's only because you're new"
4120,THE CHILDREN,to him.'
4121,THE CHILDREN,
4122,THE CHILDREN,"'But, confound you! he's a ghoul--' I began."
4123,THE CHILDREN,
4124,THE CHILDREN,"'And when he gets quite well, you'll send him back to her direct with"
4125,THE CHILDREN,"your love, and she'll give you some pretty four-tailed goldfish,' said"
4126,THE CHILDREN,"Mrs. Godfrey, rising. 'That's all settled. Car, please. We're going to"
4127,THE CHILDREN,Brighton to lunch together.'
4128,THE CHILDREN,
4129,THE CHILDREN,"They ran before I could get into my stride, so I told the dog Harvey"
4130,THE CHILDREN,"what I thought of them and his mistress. He never shifted his position,"
4131,THE CHILDREN,"but stared at me, an intense, lopsided stare, eye after eye. Malachi"
4132,THE CHILDREN,"came along when he had seen his sister off, and from a distance"
4133,THE CHILDREN,counselled me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again. But
4134,THE CHILDREN,the dog Harvey never even cocked his cockable ear.
4135,THE CHILDREN,
4136,THE CHILDREN,"And so it continued as long as he was with me. Where I sat, he sat and"
4137,THE CHILDREN,"stared; where I walked, he walked beside, head stiffly slewed over one"
4138,THE CHILDREN,"shoulder in single-barrelled contemplation of me. He never gave tongue,"
4139,THE CHILDREN,"never closed in for a caress, seldom let me stir a step alone. And, to"
4140,THE CHILDREN,"my amazement, Malachi, who suffered no stranger to live within our"
4141,THE CHILDREN,"gates, saw this gaunt, growing, green-eyed devil wipe him out of my"
4142,THE CHILDREN,"service and company without a whimper. Indeed, one would have said the"
4143,THE CHILDREN,"situation interested him, for he would meet us returning from grim walks"
4144,THE CHILDREN,"together, and look alternately at Harvey and at me with the same"
4145,THE CHILDREN,quivering interest that he showed at the mouth of a rat-hole. Outside
4146,THE CHILDREN,"these inspections, Malachi withdrew himself as only a dog or a"
4147,THE CHILDREN,woman can.
4148,THE CHILDREN,
4149,THE CHILDREN,Miss Sichliffe came over after a few days (luckily I was out) with some
4150,THE CHILDREN,elaborate story of paying calls in the neighbourhood. She sent me a note
4151,THE CHILDREN,of thanks next day. I was reading it when Harvey and Malachi entered and
4152,THE CHILDREN,"disposed themselves as usual, Harvey close up to stare at me, Malachi"
4153,THE CHILDREN,"half under the sofa, watching us both. Out of curiosity I returned"
4154,THE CHILDREN,"Harvey's stare, then pulled his lopsided head on to my knee, and took"
4155,THE CHILDREN,"his eye for several minutes. Now, in Malachi's eye I can see at any hour"
4156,THE CHILDREN,"all that there is of the normal decent dog, flecked here and there with"
4157,THE CHILDREN,that strained half-soul which man's love and association have added to
4158,THE CHILDREN,"his nature. But with Harvey the eye was perplexed, as a tortured man's."
4159,THE CHILDREN,Only by looking far into its deeps could one make out the spirit of the
4160,THE CHILDREN,"proper animal, beclouded and cowering beneath some unfair burden."
4161,THE CHILDREN,
4162,THE CHILDREN,"Leggatt, my chauffeur, came in for orders."
4163,THE CHILDREN,
4164,THE CHILDREN,"'How d'you think Harvey's coming on?' I said, as I rubbed the brute's"
4165,THE CHILDREN,gulping neck. The vet had warned me of the possibilities of spinal
4166,THE CHILDREN,trouble following distemper.
4167,THE CHILDREN,
4168,THE CHILDREN,"'He ain't _my_ fancy,' was the reply. 'But _I_ don't question his"
4169,THE CHILDREN,comings and goings so long as I 'aven't to sit alone in a room
4170,THE CHILDREN,with him.'
4171,THE CHILDREN,
4172,THE CHILDREN,"'Why? He's as meek as Moses,' I said."
4173,THE CHILDREN,
4174,THE CHILDREN,'He fair gives me the creeps. P'r'aps he'll go out in fits.'
4175,THE CHILDREN,
4176,THE CHILDREN,"But Harvey, as I wrote his mistress from time to time, throve, and when"
4177,THE CHILDREN,"he grew better, would play by himself grisly games of spying, walking"
4178,THE CHILDREN,"up, hailing, and chasing another dog. From these he would break off of a"
4179,THE CHILDREN,"sudden and return to his normal stiff gait, with the air of one who had"
4180,THE CHILDREN,"forgotten some matter of life and death, which could be reached only by"
4181,THE CHILDREN,staring at me. I left him one evening posturing with the unseen on the
4182,THE CHILDREN,"lawn, and went inside to finish some letters for the post. I must have"
4183,THE CHILDREN,"been at work nearly an hour, for I was going to turn on the lights,"
4184,THE CHILDREN,"when I felt there was somebody in the room whom, the short hairs at the"
4185,THE CHILDREN,"back of my neck warned me, I was not in the least anxious to face. There"
4186,THE CHILDREN,was a mirror on the wall. As I lifted my eyes to it I saw the dog Harvey
4187,THE CHILDREN,reflected near the shadow by the closed door. He had reared himself
4188,THE CHILDREN,"full-length on his hind legs, his head a little one side to clear a sofa"
4189,THE CHILDREN,"between us, and he was looking at me. The face, with its knitted brows"
4190,THE CHILDREN,"and drawn lips, was the face of a dog, but the look, for the fraction of"
4191,THE CHILDREN,"time that I caught it, was human--wholly and horribly human. When the"
4192,THE CHILDREN,"blood in my body went forward again he had dropped to the floor, and was"
4193,THE CHILDREN,merely studying me in his usual one-eyed fashion. Next day I returned
4194,THE CHILDREN,him to Miss Sichliffe. I would not have kept him another day for the
4195,THE CHILDREN,"wealth of Asia, or even Ella Godfrey's approval."
4196,THE CHILDREN,
4197,THE CHILDREN,Miss Sichliffe's house I discovered to be a mid-Victorian mansion of
4198,THE CHILDREN,"peculiar villainy even for its period, surrounded by gardens of"
4199,THE CHILDREN,"conflicting colours, all dazzling with glass and fresh paint on"
4200,THE CHILDREN,"ironwork. Striped blinds, for it was a blazing autumn morning, covered"
4201,THE CHILDREN,"most of the windows, and a voice sang to the piano an almost forgotten"
4202,THE CHILDREN,song of Jean Ingelow's--
4203,THE CHILDREN,
4204,THE CHILDREN,"Methought that the stars were blinking bright,"
4205,THE CHILDREN,And the old brig's sails unfurled--
4206,THE CHILDREN,
4207,THE CHILDREN,"Down came the loud pedal, and the unrestrained cry swelled out across a"
4208,THE CHILDREN,bed of tritomas consuming in their own fires--
4209,THE CHILDREN,
4210,THE CHILDREN,When I said I will sail to my love this night
4211,THE CHILDREN,On the other side of the world.
4212,THE CHILDREN,
4213,THE CHILDREN,"I have no music, but the voice drew. I waited till the end:"
4214,THE CHILDREN,
4215,THE CHILDREN,"Oh, maid most dear, I am not here"
4216,THE CHILDREN,I have no place apart--
4217,THE CHILDREN,"No dwelling more on sea or shore,"
4218,THE CHILDREN,But only in thy heart.
4219,THE CHILDREN,
4220,THE CHILDREN,It seemed to me a poor life that had no more than that to do at eleven
4221,THE CHILDREN,o'clock of a Tuesday forenoon. Then Miss Sichliffe suddenly lumbered
4222,THE CHILDREN,"through a French window in clumsy haste, her brows contracted against"
4223,THE CHILDREN,the light.
4224,THE CHILDREN,
4225,THE CHILDREN,"'Well?' she said, delivering the word like a spear-thrust, with the full"
4226,THE CHILDREN,weight of a body behind it.
4227,THE CHILDREN,
4228,THE CHILDREN,"'I've brought Harvey back at last,' I replied. 'Here he is.'"
4229,THE CHILDREN,
4230,THE CHILDREN,"But it was at me she looked, not at the dog who had cast himself at her"
4231,THE CHILDREN,feet--looked as though she would have fished my soul out of my breast on
4232,THE CHILDREN,the instant.
4233,THE CHILDREN,
4234,THE CHILDREN,'Wha--what did you think of him? What did _you_ make of him?' she
4235,THE CHILDREN,panted. I was too taken aback for the moment to reply. Her voice broke
4236,THE CHILDREN,"as she stooped to the dog at her knees. 'O Harvey, Harvey! You utterly"
4237,THE CHILDREN,"worthless old devil!' she cried, and the dog cringed and abased himself"
4238,THE CHILDREN,in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon. I made to go.
4239,THE CHILDREN,
4240,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, but please, you mustn't!' She tugged at the car's side. 'Wouldn't"
4241,THE CHILDREN,"you like some flowers or some orchids? We've really splendid orchids,"
4242,THE CHILDREN,and'--she clasped her hands--'there are Japanese goldfish--real
4243,THE CHILDREN,"Japanese goldfish, with four tails. If you don't care for 'em, perhaps"
4244,THE CHILDREN,"your friends or somebody--oh, please!'"
4245,THE CHILDREN,
4246,THE CHILDREN,"Harvey had recovered himself, and I realised that this woman beyond the"
4247,THE CHILDREN,decencies was fawning on me as the dog had fawned on her.
4248,THE CHILDREN,
4249,THE CHILDREN,"'Certainly,' I said, ashamed to meet her eye. 'I'm lunching at"
4250,THE CHILDREN,"Mittleham, but--'"
4251,THE CHILDREN,
4252,THE CHILDREN,"'There's plenty of time,' she entreated. 'What do _you_ think of"
4253,THE CHILDREN,Harvey?'
4254,THE CHILDREN,
4255,THE CHILDREN,"'He's a queer beast,' I said, getting out. 'He does nothing but stare at"
4256,THE CHILDREN,me.'
4257,THE CHILDREN,
4258,THE CHILDREN,'Does he stare at you all the time he's with you?'
4259,THE CHILDREN,
4260,THE CHILDREN,'Always. He's doing it now. Look!'
4261,THE CHILDREN,
4262,THE CHILDREN,"We had halted. Harvey had sat down, and was staring from one to the"
4263,THE CHILDREN,other with a weaving motion of the head.
4264,THE CHILDREN,
4265,THE CHILDREN,"'He'll do that all day,' I said. 'What is it, Harvey?'"
4266,THE CHILDREN,
4267,THE CHILDREN,"'Yes, what _is_ it, Harvey?' she echoed. The dog's throat twitched, his"
4268,THE CHILDREN,body stiffened and shook as though he were going to have a fit. Then he
4269,THE CHILDREN,came back with a visible wrench to his unwinking watch.
4270,THE CHILDREN,
4271,THE CHILDREN,'Always so?' she whispered.
4272,THE CHILDREN,
4273,THE CHILDREN,"'Always,' I replied, and told her something of his life with me. She"
4274,THE CHILDREN,"nodded once or twice, and in the end led me into the house."
4275,THE CHILDREN,
4276,THE CHILDREN,There were unaging pitch-pine doors of Gothic design in it; there were
4277,THE CHILDREN,inlaid marble mantel-pieces and cut-steel fenders; there were stupendous
4278,THE CHILDREN,"wall-papers, and octagonal, medallioned Wedgwood what-nots, and"
4279,THE CHILDREN,"black-and-gilt Austrian images holding candelabra, with every other"
4280,THE CHILDREN,refinement that Art had achieved or wealth had bought between 1851 and
4281,THE CHILDREN,1878. And everything reeked of varnish.
4282,THE CHILDREN,
4283,THE CHILDREN,"'Now!' she opened a baize door, and pointed down a long corridor flanked"
4284,THE CHILDREN,with more Gothic doors. 'This was where we used to--to patch 'em up.
4285,THE CHILDREN,You've heard of us. Mrs. Godfrey told you in the garden the day I got
4286,THE CHILDREN,"Harvey given me. I'--she drew in her breath--'I live here by myself, and"
4287,THE CHILDREN,"I have a very large income. Come back, Harvey.'"
4288,THE CHILDREN,
4289,THE CHILDREN,"He had tiptoed down the corridor, as rigid as ever, and was sitting"
4290,THE CHILDREN,"outside one of the shut doors. 'Look here!' she said, and planted"
4291,THE CHILDREN,herself squarely in front of me. 'I tell you this because you--you've
4292,THE CHILDREN,"patched up Harvey, too. Now, I want you to remember that my name is"
4293,THE CHILDREN,Moira. Mother calls me Marjorie because it's more refined; but my real
4294,THE CHILDREN,"name is Moira, and I am in my thirty-fourth year.'"
4295,THE CHILDREN,
4296,THE CHILDREN,"'Very good,' I said. 'I'll remember all that.'"
4297,THE CHILDREN,
4298,THE CHILDREN,'Thank you.' Then with a sudden swoop into the humility of an abashed
4299,THE CHILDREN,boy--''Sorry if I haven't said the proper things. You see--there's
4300,THE CHILDREN,"Harvey looking at us again. Oh, I want to say--if ever you want anything"
4301,THE CHILDREN,in the way of orchids or goldfish or--or anything else that would be
4302,THE CHILDREN,"useful to you, you've only to come to me for it. Under the will I'm"
4303,THE CHILDREN,"perfectly independent, and we're a long-lived family, worse luck!' She"
4304,THE CHILDREN,"looked at me, and her face worked like glass behind driven flame. 'I may"
4305,THE CHILDREN,"reasonably expect to live another fifty years,' she said."
4306,THE CHILDREN,
4307,THE CHILDREN,"'Thank you, Miss Sichliffe,' I replied. 'If I want anything, you may be"
4308,THE CHILDREN,sure I'll come to you for it.' She nodded. 'Now I must get over to
4309,THE CHILDREN,"Mittleham,' I said."
4310,THE CHILDREN,
4311,THE CHILDREN,'Mr. Attley will ask you all about this.' For the first time she laughed
4312,THE CHILDREN,aloud. 'I'm afraid I frightened him nearly out of the county. I didn't
4313,THE CHILDREN,"think, of course. But I dare say he knows by this time he was wrong. Say"
4314,THE CHILDREN,good-bye to Harvey.'
4315,THE CHILDREN,
4316,THE CHILDREN,"'Good-bye, old man,' I said. 'Give me a farewell stare, so we shall know"
4317,THE CHILDREN,each other when we meet again.'
4318,THE CHILDREN,
4319,THE CHILDREN,"The dog looked up, then moved slowly toward me, and stood, head bowed to"
4320,THE CHILDREN,"the floor, shaking in every muscle as I patted him; and when I turned, I"
4321,THE CHILDREN,saw him crawl back to her feet.
4322,THE CHILDREN,
4323,THE CHILDREN,That was not a good preparation for the rampant boy-and-girl-dominated
4324,THE CHILDREN,"lunch at Mittleham, which, as usual, I found in possession of everybody"
4325,THE CHILDREN,except the owner.
4326,THE CHILDREN,
4327,THE CHILDREN,'But what did the dromedary say when you brought her beast back?' Attley
4328,THE CHILDREN,demanded.
4329,THE CHILDREN,
4330,THE CHILDREN,"'The usual polite things,' I replied. 'I'm posing as the nice doggy"
4331,THE CHILDREN,friend nowadays.'
4332,THE CHILDREN,
4333,THE CHILDREN,"'I don't envy you. She's never darkened my doors, thank goodness, since"
4334,THE CHILDREN,I left Harvey at your place. I suppose she'll run about the county now
4335,THE CHILDREN,swearing you cured him. That's a woman's idea of gratitude.' Attley
4336,THE CHILDREN,"seemed rather hurt, and Mrs. Godfrey laughed."
4337,THE CHILDREN,
4338,THE CHILDREN,"'That proves you were right about Miss Sichliffe, Ella,' I said. 'She"
4339,THE CHILDREN,had no designs on anybody.'
4340,THE CHILDREN,
4341,THE CHILDREN,'I'm always right in these matters. But didn't she even offer you a
4342,THE CHILDREN,goldfish?'
4343,THE CHILDREN,
4344,THE CHILDREN,"'Not a thing,' said I. 'You know what an old maid's like where her"
4345,THE CHILDREN,precious dog's concerned.' And though I have tried vainly to lie to Ella
4346,THE CHILDREN,"Godfrey for many years, I believe that in this case I succeeded."
4347,THE CHILDREN,
4348,THE CHILDREN,"When I turned into our drive that evening, Leggatt observed half aloud:"
4349,THE CHILDREN,
4350,THE CHILDREN,'I'm glad Zvengali's back where he belongs. It's time our Mike had a
4351,THE CHILDREN,look in.'
4352,THE CHILDREN,
4353,THE CHILDREN,"Sure enough, there was Malachi back again in spirit as well as flesh,"
4354,THE CHILDREN,but still with that odd air of expectation he had picked up from Harvey.
4355,THE CHILDREN,
4356,THE CHILDREN,*       *       *       *       *
4357,THE CHILDREN,
4358,THE CHILDREN,"It was in January that Attley wrote me that Mrs. Godfrey, wintering in"
4359,THE CHILDREN,"Madeira with Milly, her unmarried daughter, had been attacked with"
4360,THE CHILDREN,"something like enteric; that the hotel, anxious for its good name, had"
4361,THE CHILDREN,thrust them both out into a cottage annexe; that he was off with a
4362,THE CHILDREN,"nurse, and that I was not to leave England till I heard from him again."
4363,THE CHILDREN,"In a week he wired that Milly was down as well, and that I must bring"
4364,THE CHILDREN,"out two more nurses, with suitable delicacies."
4365,THE CHILDREN,
4366,THE CHILDREN,"Within seventeen hours I had got them all aboard the Cape boat, and had"
4367,THE CHILDREN,seen the women safely collapsed into sea-sickness. The next few weeks
4368,THE CHILDREN,"were for me, as for the invalids, a low delirium, clouded with fantastic"
4369,THE CHILDREN,memories of Portuguese officials trying to tax calves'-foot jelly;
4370,THE CHILDREN,voluble doctors insisting that true typhoid was unknown in the island;
4371,THE CHILDREN,"nurses who had to be exercised, taken out of themselves, and returned on"
4372,THE CHILDREN,"the tick of change of guard; night slides down glassy, cobbled streets,"
4373,THE CHILDREN,"smelling of sewage and flowers, between walls whose every stone and"
4374,THE CHILDREN,"patch Attley and I knew; vigils in stucco verandahs, watching the curve"
4375,THE CHILDREN,and descent of great stars or drawing auguries from the break of dawn;
4376,THE CHILDREN,"insane interludes of gambling at the local Casino, where we won heaps of"
4377,THE CHILDREN,unconsoling silver; blasts of steamers arriving and departing in the
4378,THE CHILDREN,"roads; help offered by total strangers, grabbed at or thrust aside; the"
4379,THE CHILDREN,long nightmare crumbling back into sanity one forenoon under a
4380,THE CHILDREN,"vine-covered trellis, where Attley sat hugging a nurse, while the others"
4381,THE CHILDREN,"danced a noiseless, neat-footed breakdown never learned at the Middlesex"
4382,THE CHILDREN,"Hospital. At last, as the tension came out all over us in aches and"
4383,THE CHILDREN,"tingles that we put down to the country wine, a vision of Mrs. Godfrey,"
4384,THE CHILDREN,"her grey hair turned to spun-glass, but her eyes triumphant over the"
4385,THE CHILDREN,"shadow of retreating death beneath them, with Milly, enormously grown,"
4386,THE CHILDREN,"and clutching life back to her young breast, both stretched out on cane"
4387,THE CHILDREN,"chairs, clamouring for food."
4388,THE CHILDREN,
4389,THE CHILDREN,In this ungirt hour there imported himself into our life a
4390,THE CHILDREN,"youngish-looking middle-aged man of the name of Shend, with a blurred"
4391,THE CHILDREN,"face and deprecating eyes. He said he had gambled with me at the Casino,"
4392,THE CHILDREN,"which was no recommendation, and I remember that he twice gave me a"
4393,THE CHILDREN,"basket of champagne and liqueur brandy for the invalids, which a sailor"
4394,THE CHILDREN,in a red-tasselled cap carried up to the cottage for me at 3 A.M. He
4395,THE CHILDREN,turned out to be the son of some merchant prince in the oil and colour
4396,THE CHILDREN,"line, and the owner of a four-hundred-ton steam yacht, into which, at"
4397,THE CHILDREN,"his gentle insistence, we later shifted our camp, staff, and equipage,"
4398,THE CHILDREN,Milly weeping with delight to escape from the horrible cottage. There we
4399,THE CHILDREN,"lay off Funchal for weeks, while Shend did miracles of luxury and"
4400,THE CHILDREN,"attendance through deputies, and never once asked how his guests were"
4401,THE CHILDREN,"enjoying themselves. Indeed, for several days at a time we would see"
4402,THE CHILDREN,"nothing of him. He was, he said, subject to malaria. Giving as they do"
4403,THE CHILDREN,"with both hands, I knew that Attley and Mrs. Godfrey could take nobly;"
4404,THE CHILDREN,but I never met a man who so nobly gave and so nobly received thanks as
4405,THE CHILDREN,Shend did.
4406,THE CHILDREN,
4407,THE CHILDREN,"'Tell us why you have been so unbelievably kind to us gipsies,' Mrs."
4408,THE CHILDREN,Godfrey said to him one day on deck.
4409,THE CHILDREN,
4410,THE CHILDREN,He looked up from a diagram of some Thames-mouth shoals which he was
4411,THE CHILDREN,"explaining to me, and answered with his gentle smile:"
4412,THE CHILDREN,
4413,THE CHILDREN,'I will. It's because it makes me happy--it makes me more than happy--to
4414,THE CHILDREN,be with you. It makes me comfortable. You know how selfish men are? If a
4415,THE CHILDREN,"man feels comfortable all over with certain people, he'll bore them to"
4416,THE CHILDREN,"death, just like a dog. You always make me feel as if pleasant things"
4417,THE CHILDREN,were going to happen to me.'
4418,THE CHILDREN,
4419,THE CHILDREN,'Haven't any ever happened before?' Milly asked.
4420,THE CHILDREN,
4421,THE CHILDREN,'This is the most pleasant thing that has happened to me in ever so many
4422,THE CHILDREN,"years,' he replied. 'I feel like the man in the Bible, ""It's good for me"
4423,THE CHILDREN,"to be here."" Generally, I don't feel that it's good for me to be"
4424,THE CHILDREN,"anywhere in particular.' Then, as one begging a favour. 'You'll let me"
4425,THE CHILDREN,"come home with you--in the same boat, I mean? I'd take you back in this"
4426,THE CHILDREN,"thing of mine, and that would save you packing your trunks, but she's"
4427,THE CHILDREN,too lively for spring work across the Bay.'
4428,THE CHILDREN,
4429,THE CHILDREN,"We booked our berths, and when the time came, he wafted us and ours"
4430,THE CHILDREN,aboard the Southampton mail-boat with the pomp of plenipotentiaries and
4431,THE CHILDREN,"the precision of the Navy. Then he dismissed his yacht, and became an"
4432,THE CHILDREN,"inconspicuous passenger in a cabin opposite to mine, on the port side."
4433,THE CHILDREN,
4434,THE CHILDREN,"We ran at once into early British spring weather, followed by sou'west"
4435,THE CHILDREN,"gales. Mrs. Godfrey, Milly, and the nurses disappeared. Attley stood it"
4436,THE CHILDREN,"out, visibly yellowing, till the next meal, and followed suit, and Shend"
4437,THE CHILDREN,and I had the little table all to ourselves. I found him even more
4438,THE CHILDREN,"attractive when the women were away. The natural sweetness of the man,"
4439,THE CHILDREN,"his voice, and bearing all fascinated me, and his knowledge of practical"
4440,THE CHILDREN,seamanship (he held an extra master's certificate) was a real joy. We
4441,THE CHILDREN,"sat long in the empty saloon and longer in the smoking-room, making"
4442,THE CHILDREN,dashes downstairs over slippery decks at the eleventh hour.
4443,THE CHILDREN,
4444,THE CHILDREN,"It was on Friday night, just as I was going to bed, that he came into my"
4445,THE CHILDREN,"cabin, after cleaning his teeth, which he did half a dozen times a day."
4446,THE CHILDREN,
4447,THE CHILDREN,"'I say,' he began hurriedly, 'do you mind if I come in here for a"
4448,THE CHILDREN,little? I'm a bit edgy.' I must have shown surprise. 'I'm ever so much
4449,THE CHILDREN,"better about liquor than I used to be, but--it's the whisky in the"
4450,THE CHILDREN,"suitcase that throws me. For God's sake, old man, don't go back on me"
4451,THE CHILDREN,to-night! Look at my hands!'
4452,THE CHILDREN,
4453,THE CHILDREN,They were fairly jumping at the wrists. He sat down on a trunk that had
4454,THE CHILDREN,"slid out with the roll. We had reduced speed, and were surging in"
4455,THE CHILDREN,confused seas that pounded on the black port-glasses. The night promised
4456,THE CHILDREN,to be a pleasant one!
4457,THE CHILDREN,
4458,THE CHILDREN,"'You understand, of course, don't you?' he chattered."
4459,THE CHILDREN,
4460,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh yes,' I said cheerily; 'but how about--'"
4461,THE CHILDREN,
4462,THE CHILDREN,"'No, no; on no account the doctor. 'Tell a doctor, tell the whole ship."
4463,THE CHILDREN,"Besides, I've only got a touch of 'em. You'd never have guessed it,"
4464,THE CHILDREN,would you? The tooth-wash does the trick. I'll give you the
4465,THE CHILDREN,prescription.'
4466,THE CHILDREN,
4467,THE CHILDREN,"I'll send a note to the doctor for a prescription, shall I?' I"
4468,THE CHILDREN,suggested.
4469,THE CHILDREN,
4470,THE CHILDREN,"'Right! I put myself unreservedly in your hands. 'Fact is, I always did."
4471,THE CHILDREN,"I said to myself--'sure I don't bore you?--the minute I saw you, I said,"
4472,THE CHILDREN,"""Thou art the man.""' He repeated the phrase as he picked at his knees."
4473,THE CHILDREN,"'All the same, you can take it from me that the ewe-lamb business is a"
4474,THE CHILDREN,rotten bad one. I don't care how unfaithful the shepherd may be. Drunk
4475,THE CHILDREN,"or sober, 'tisn't cricket.'"
4476,THE CHILDREN,
4477,THE CHILDREN,A surge of the trunk threw him across the cabin as the steward answered
4478,THE CHILDREN,my bell. I wrote my requisition to the doctor while Shend was struggling
4479,THE CHILDREN,to his feet.
4480,THE CHILDREN,
4481,THE CHILDREN,"'What's wrong?' he began. 'Oh, I know. We're slowing for soundings off"
4482,THE CHILDREN,"Ushant. It's about time, too. You'd better ship the dead-lights when you"
4483,THE CHILDREN,"come back, Matchem. It'll save you waking us later. This sea's going to"
4484,THE CHILDREN,"get up when the tide turns. That'll show you,' he said as the man left,"
4485,THE CHILDREN,'that I am to be trusted. You--you'll stop me if I say anything I
4486,THE CHILDREN,"shouldn't, won't you?'"
4487,THE CHILDREN,
4488,THE CHILDREN,"'Talk away,' I replied, 'if it makes you feel better.'"
4489,THE CHILDREN,
4490,THE CHILDREN,'That's it; you've hit it exactly. You always make me feel better. I can
4491,THE CHILDREN,rely on you. It's awkward soundings but you'll see me through it. We'll
4492,THE CHILDREN,"defeat him yet.... I may be an utterly worthless devil, but I'm not a"
4493,THE CHILDREN,"brawler.... I told him so at breakfast. I said, ""Doctor, I detest"
4494,THE CHILDREN,"brawling, but if ever you allow that girl to be insulted again as"
4495,THE CHILDREN,"Clements insulted her, I will break your neck with my own hands."" You"
4496,THE CHILDREN,think I was right?'
4497,THE CHILDREN,
4498,THE CHILDREN,"'Absolutely,' I agreed."
4499,THE CHILDREN,
4500,THE CHILDREN,'Then we needn't discuss the matter any further. That man was a murderer
4501,THE CHILDREN,"in intention--outside the law, you understand, as it was then. They've"
4502,THE CHILDREN,changed it since--but he never deceived _me_. I told him so. I said to
4503,THE CHILDREN,"him at the time, ""I don't know what price you're going to put on my"
4504,THE CHILDREN,"head, but if ever you allow Clements to insult her again, you'll never"
4505,THE CHILDREN,"live to claim it.""'"
4506,THE CHILDREN,
4507,THE CHILDREN,"'And what did he do?' I asked, to carry on the conversation, for Matchem"
4508,THE CHILDREN,entered with the bromide.
4509,THE CHILDREN,
4510,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, crumpled up at once. 'Lead still going, Matchem?'"
4511,THE CHILDREN,
4512,THE CHILDREN,"'I 'aven't 'eard,' said that faithful servant of the Union-Castle"
4513,THE CHILDREN,Company.
4514,THE CHILDREN,
4515,THE CHILDREN,"'Quite right. Never alarm the passengers. Ship the dead-light, will"
4516,THE CHILDREN,"you?' Matchem shipped it, for we were rolling very heavily. There were"
4517,THE CHILDREN,tramplings and gull-like cries from on deck. Shend looked at me with a
4518,THE CHILDREN,mariner's eye.
4519,THE CHILDREN,
4520,THE CHILDREN,"'That's nothing,' he said protectingly."
4521,THE CHILDREN,
4522,THE CHILDREN,"'Oh, it's all right for you,' I said, jumping at the idea. '_I_ haven't"
4523,THE CHILDREN,an extra master's certificate. I'm only a passenger. I confess it
4524,THE CHILDREN,funks me.'
4525,THE CHILDREN,
4526,THE CHILDREN,Instantly his whole bearing changed to answer the appeal.
4527,THE CHILDREN,
4528,THE CHILDREN,"'My dear fellow, it's as simple as houses. We're hunting for sixty-five"
4529,THE CHILDREN,"fathom water. Anything short of sixty, with a sou'west wind means--but"
4530,THE CHILDREN,I'll get my Channel Pilot out of my cabin and give you the general idea.
4531,THE CHILDREN,I'm only too grateful to do anything to put your mind at ease.'
4532,THE CHILDREN,
4533,THE CHILDREN,"And so, perhaps, for another hour--he declined the drink--Channel Pilot"
4534,THE CHILDREN,"in hand, he navigated us round Ushant, and at my request up-channel to"
4535,THE CHILDREN,"Southampton, light by light, with explanations and reminiscences. I"
4536,THE CHILDREN,"professed myself soothed at last, and suggested bed."
4537,THE CHILDREN,
4538,THE CHILDREN,"'In a second,' said he. 'Now, you wouldn't think, would you'--he glanced"
4539,THE CHILDREN,off the book toward my wildly swaying dressing-gown on the door--'that
4540,THE CHILDREN,"I've been seeing things for the last half-hour? 'Fact is, I'm just on"
4541,THE CHILDREN,"the edge of 'em, skating on thin ice round the corner--nor'east as near"
4542,THE CHILDREN,as nothing--where that dog's looking at me.'
4543,THE CHILDREN,
4544,THE CHILDREN,'What's the dog like?' I asked.
4545,THE CHILDREN,
4546,THE CHILDREN,"'Ah, that _is_ comforting of you! Most men walk through 'em to show me"
4547,THE CHILDREN,they aren't real. As if I didn't know! But _you're_ different. Anybody
4548,THE CHILDREN,could see that with half an eye.' He stiffened and pointed. 'Damn it
4549,THE CHILDREN,"all! The dog sees it too with half an--Why, he knows you! Knows you"
4550,THE CHILDREN,perfectly. D'you know _him_?'
4551,THE CHILDREN,
4552,THE CHILDREN,'How can I tell if he isn't real?' I insisted.
4553,THE CHILDREN,
4554,THE CHILDREN,'But you can! _You're_ all right. I saw that from the first. Don't go
4555,THE CHILDREN,back on me now or I shall go to pieces like the _Drummond Castle_. I beg
4556,THE CHILDREN,"your pardon, old man; but, you see, you _do_ know the dog. I'll prove"
4557,THE CHILDREN,"it. What's that dog doing? Come on! _You_ know.' A tremor shook him, and"
4558,THE CHILDREN,"he put his hand on my knee, and whispered with great meaning: 'I'll"
4559,THE CHILDREN,letter or halve it with you. There! You begin.'
4560,THE CHILDREN,
4561,THE CHILDREN,"'S,' said I to humour him, for a dog would most likely be standing or"
4562,THE CHILDREN,"sitting, or may be scratching or sniffling or staring."
4563,THE CHILDREN,
4564,THE CHILDREN,"'Q,' he went on, and I could feel the heat of his shaking hand."

4572,'N.',"'T-i-n-g,' he ran out. 'There! That proves it. I knew you knew him. You"
4573,'N.',"don't know what a relief that is. Between ourselves, old man, he--he's"
4574,'N.',been turning up lately a--a damn sight more often than I cared for. And
4575,'N.',a squinting dog--a dog that squints! I mean that's a bit _too_ much.
4576,'N.',"Eh? What?' He gulped and half rose, and I thought that the full tide of"
4577,'N.',delirium would be on him in another sentence.
4578,'N.',
4579,'N.',"'Not a bit of it,' I said as a last chance, with my hand over the"
4580,'N.',"bellpush. 'Why, you've just proved that I know him; so there are two of"
4581,'N.',"us in the game, anyhow.'"
4582,'N.',
4583,'N.','By Jove! that _is_ an idea! Of course there are. I knew you'd see me
4584,'N.',"through. We'll defeat them yet. Hi, pup!... He's gone. Absolutely"
4585,'N.',"disappeared!' He sighed with relief, and I caught the lucky moment."
4586,'N.',
4587,'N.',"'Good business! I expect he only came to have a look at me,' I said."
4588,'N.',"'Now, get this drink down and turn in to the lower bunk.'"
4589,'N.',
4590,'N.',"He obeyed, protesting that he could not inconvenience me, and in the"
4591,'N.',"midst of apologies sank into a dead sleep. I expected a wakeful night,"
4592,'N.',having a certain amount to think over; but no sooner had I scrambled
4593,'N.',into the top bunk than sleep came on me like a wave from the other side
4594,'N.',of the world.
4595,'N.',
4596,'N.',"In the morning there were apologies, which we got over at breakfast"
4597,'N.',before our party were about.
4598,'N.',
4599,'N.',"'I suppose--after this--well, I don't blame you. I'm rather a lonely"
4600,'N.',"chap, though.' His eyes lifted dog-like across the table."
4601,'N.',
4602,'N.',"'Shend,' I replied, 'I'm not running a Sunday school. You're coming home"
4603,'N.',with me in my car as soon as we land.'
4604,'N.',
4605,'N.','That is kind of you--kinder than you think.'
4606,'N.',
4607,'N.',"'That's because you're a little jumpy still. Now, I don't want to mix"
4608,'N.',up in your private affairs--'
4609,'N.',
4610,'N.',"'But I'd like you to,' he interrupted."
4611,'N.',
4612,'N.',"'Then, would you mind telling me the Christian name of a girl who was"
4613,'N.',insulted by a man called Clements?'
4614,'N.',
4615,'N.',"'Moira,' he whispered; and just then Mrs. Godfrey and Milly came to"
4616,'N.',table with their shore-going hats on.
4617,'N.',
4618,'N.',"We did not tie up till noon, but the faithful Leggatt had intrigued his"
4619,'N.',"way down to the dock-edge, and beside him sat Malachi, wearing his"
4620,'N.',"collar of gold, or Leggatt makes it look so, as eloquent as Demosthenes."
4621,'N.',Shend flinched a little when he saw him. We packed Mrs. Godfrey and
4622,'N.',"Milly into Attley's car--they were going with him to Mittleham, of"
4623,'N.',course--and drew clear across the railway lines to find England all lit
4624,'N.',and perfumed for spring. Shend sighed with happiness.
4625,'N.',
4626,'N.',"'D'you know,' he said, 'if--if you'd chucked me--I should have gone down"
4627,'N.',to my cabin after breakfast and cut my throat. And now--it's like a
4628,'N.',"dream--a good dream, you know.'"
4629,'N.',
4630,'N.',We lunched with the other three at Romsey. Then I sat in front for a
4631,'N.',"little while to talk to my Malachi. When I looked back, Shend was"
4632,'N.',"solidly asleep, and stayed so for the next two hours, while Leggatt"
4633,'N.',chased Attley's fat Daimler along the green-speckled hedges. He woke up
4634,'N.',"when we said good-bye at Mittleham, with promises to meet again"
4635,'N.',very soon.
4636,'N.',
4637,'N.',"'And I hope,' said Mrs. Godfrey, 'that everything pleasant will happen"
4638,'N.',to you.'
4639,'N.',
4640,'N.',"'Heaps and heaps--all at once,' cried long, weak Milly, waving her wet"
4641,'N.',handkerchief.
4642,'N.',
4643,'N.','I've just got to look in at a house near here for a minute to inquire
4644,'N.',"about a dog,' I said, 'and then we will go home.'"
4645,'N.',
4646,'N.',"'I used to know this part of the world,' he replied, and said no more"
4647,'N.',till Leggatt shot past the lodge at the Sichliffes's gate. Then I
4648,'N.',heard him gasp.
4649,'N.',
4650,'N.',"Miss Sichliffe, in a green waterproof, an orange jersey, and a pinkish"
4651,'N.',"leather hat, was working on a bulb-border. She straightened herself as"
4652,'N.',"the car stopped, and breathed hard. Shend got out and walked towards"
4653,'N.',"her. They shook hands, turned round together, and went into the house."
4654,'N.',Then the dog Harvey pranced out corkily from under the lee of a bench.
4655,'N.',"Malachi, with one joyous swoop, fell on him as an enemy and an equal."
4656,'N.',"Harvey, for his part, freed from all burden whatsoever except the"
4657,'N.',"obvious duty of a man-dog on his own ground, met Malachi without reserve"
4658,'N.',"or remorse, and with six months' additional growth to come and go on."
4659,'N.',
4660,'N.',"'Don't check 'em!' cried Leggatt, dancing round the flurry. 'They've"
4661,'N.',both been saving up for each other all this time. It'll do 'em worlds
4662,'N.',of good.'
4663,'N.',
4664,'N.',"'Leggatt,' I said, 'will you take Mr. Shend's bag and suitcase up to the"
4665,'N.',house and put them down just inside the door? Then we will go on.'
4666,'N.',
4667,'N.',"So I enjoyed the finish alone. It was a dead heat, and they licked each"
4668,'N.',"other's jaws in amity till Harvey, one imploring eye on me, leaped into"
4669,'N.',"the front seat, and Malachi backed his appeal. It was theft, but I took"
4670,'N.',"him, and we talked all the way home of r-rats and r-rabbits and bones"
4671,'N.',and baths and the other basic facts of life. That evening after dinner
4672,'N.',"they slept before the fire, with their warm chins across the hollows of"
4673,'N.',my ankles--to each chin an ankle--till I kicked them upstairs to bed.

4676,'N.',
4677,'N.',"I was not at Mittleham when she came over to announce her engagement,"
4678,'N.',"but I heard of it when Mrs. Godfrey and Attley came, forty miles an"
4679,'N.',"hour, over to me, and Mrs. Godfrey called me names of the worst for"
4680,'N.',suppression of information.
4681,'N.',
4682,'N.',"'As long as it wasn't me, I don't care,' said Attley."
4683,'N.',
4684,'N.',"'I believe you knew it all along,' Mrs. Godfrey repeated. 'Else what"
4685,'N.',made you drive that man literally into her arms?'
4686,'N.',
4687,'N.',"'To ask after the dog Harvey,' I replied."
4688,'N.',
4689,'N.',"'Then, what's the beast doing here?' Attley demanded, for Malachi and"
4690,'N.',"the dog Harvey were deep in a council of the family with Bettina, who"
4691,'N.',was being out-argued.
4692,'N.',
4693,'N.',"'Oh, Harvey seemed to think himself _de trop_ where he was,' I said."
4694,'N.','And she hasn't sent after him. You'd better save Bettina before they
4695,'N.',kill her.'
4696,'N.',
4697,'N.',"'There's been enough lying about that dog,' said Mrs. Godfrey to me. 'If"
4698,'N.',"he wasn't born in lies, he was baptized in 'em. D'you know why she"
4699,'N.',called him Harvey? It only occurred to me in those dreadful days when I
4700,'N.',"was ill, and one can't keep from thinking, and thinks everything. D'you"
4701,'N.',know your Boswell? What did Johnson say about Hervey--with an e?'
4702,'N.',
4703,'N.',"'Oh, _that's_ it, is it?' I cried incautiously. 'That was why I ought to"
4704,'N.',"have verified my quotations. The spelling defeated me. Wait a moment,"
4705,'N.',"and it will come back. Johnson said: ""He was a vicious man,""' I began."
4706,'N.',
4707,'N.',"'""But very kind to me,""' Mrs. Godfrey prompted. Then, both together,"
4708,'N.',"'""If you call a dog Hervey, I shall love him.""'"
4709,'N.',
4710,'N.',"'So you _were_ mixed up in it. At any rate, you had your suspicions from"
4711,'N.',"the first? Tell me,' she said."
4712,'N.',
4713,'N.',"'Ella,' I said, 'I don't know anything rational or reasonable about any"
4714,'N.',"of it. It was all--all woman-work, and it scared me horribly.'"
4715,'N.',
4716,'N.','Why?' she asked.
4717,'N.',
4718,'N.',That was six years ago. I have written this tale to let her
4719,'N.',know--wherever she may be.

4777,THE COMFORTERS,
4778,THE COMFORTERS,
4779,THE COMFORTERS,Our drive till then had been quite a success. The other men in the car
4780,THE COMFORTERS,"were my friend Woodhouse, young Ollyett, a distant connection of his,"
4781,THE COMFORTERS,"and Pallant, the M.P. Woodhouse's business was the treatment and cure of"
4782,THE COMFORTERS,sick journals. He knew by instinct the precise moment in a newspaper's
4783,THE COMFORTERS,life when the impetus of past good management is exhausted and it
4784,THE COMFORTERS,fetches up on the dead-centre between slow and expensive collapse and
4785,THE COMFORTERS,the new start which can be given by gold injections--and genius. He was
4786,THE COMFORTERS,wisely ignorant of journalism; but when he stooped on a carcase there
4787,THE COMFORTERS,"was sure to be meat. He had that week added a half-dead, halfpenny"
4788,THE COMFORTERS,"evening paper to his collection, which consisted of a prosperous London"
4789,THE COMFORTERS,"daily, one provincial ditto, and a limp-bodied weekly of commercial"
4790,THE COMFORTERS,"leanings. He had also, that very hour, planted me with a large block of"
4791,THE COMFORTERS,"the evening paper's common shares, and was explaining the whole art of"
4792,THE COMFORTERS,"editorship to Ollyett, a young man three years from Oxford, with"
4793,THE COMFORTERS,coir-matting-coloured hair and a face harshly modelled by harsh
4794,THE COMFORTERS,"experiences, who, I understood, was assisting in the new venture."
4795,THE COMFORTERS,"Pallant, the long, wrinkled M.P., whose voice is more like a crane's"
4796,THE COMFORTERS,"than a peacock's, took no shares, but gave us all advice."
4797,THE COMFORTERS,
4798,THE COMFORTERS,"'You'll find it rather a knacker's yard,' Woodhouse was saying. 'Yes, I"
4799,THE COMFORTERS,know they call me The Knacker; but it will pay inside a year. All my
4800,THE COMFORTERS,papers do. I've only one motto: Back your luck and back your staff.
4801,THE COMFORTERS,It'll come out all right.'
4802,THE COMFORTERS,
4803,THE COMFORTERS,"Then the car stopped, and a policeman asked our names and addresses for"
4804,THE COMFORTERS,exceeding the speed-limit. We pointed out that the road ran absolutely
4805,THE COMFORTERS,straight for half a mile ahead without even a side-lane. 'That's just
4806,THE COMFORTERS,"what we depend on,' said the policeman unpleasantly."
4807,THE COMFORTERS,
4808,THE COMFORTERS,"'The usual swindle,' said Woodhouse under his breath. 'What's the name"
4809,THE COMFORTERS,of this place?'
4810,THE COMFORTERS,
4811,THE COMFORTERS,"'Huckley,' said the policeman. 'H-u-c-k-l-e-y,' and wrote something in"
4812,THE COMFORTERS,his note-book at which young Ollyett protested. A large red man on a
4813,THE COMFORTERS,grey horse who had been watching us from the other side of the hedge
4814,THE COMFORTERS,shouted an order we could not catch. The policeman laid his hand on the
4815,THE COMFORTERS,"rim of the right driving-door (Woodhouse carries his spare tyres aft),"
4816,THE COMFORTERS,and it closed on the button of the electric horn. The grey horse at once
4817,THE COMFORTERS,"bolted, and we could hear the rider swearing all across the landscape."
4818,THE COMFORTERS,
4819,THE COMFORTERS,"'Damn it, man, you've got your silly fist on it! Take it off!' Woodhouse"
4820,THE COMFORTERS,shouted.
4821,THE COMFORTERS,
4822,THE COMFORTERS,"'Ho!' said the constable, looking carefully at his fingers as though we"
4823,THE COMFORTERS,"had trapped them. 'That won't do you any good either,' and he wrote once"
4824,THE COMFORTERS,more in his note-book before he allowed us to go.
4825,THE COMFORTERS,
4826,THE COMFORTERS,"This was Woodhouse's first brush with motor law, and since I expected"
4827,THE COMFORTERS,"no ill consequences to myself, I pointed out that it was very serious. I"
4828,THE COMFORTERS,"took the same view myself when in due time I found that I, too, was"
4829,THE COMFORTERS,summonsed on charges ranging from the use of obscene language to
4830,THE COMFORTERS,endangering traffic.
4831,THE COMFORTERS,
4832,THE COMFORTERS,"Judgment was done in a little pale-yellow market-town with a small,"
4833,THE COMFORTERS,Jubilee clock-tower and a large corn-exchange. Woodhouse drove us there
4834,THE COMFORTERS,"in his car. Pallant, who had not been included in the summons, came with"
4835,THE COMFORTERS,"us as moral support. While we waited outside, the fat man on the grey"
4836,THE COMFORTERS,horse rode up and entered into loud talk with his brother magistrates.
4837,THE COMFORTERS,He said to one of them--for I took the trouble to note it down--'It
4838,THE COMFORTERS,"falls away from my lodge-gates, dead straight, three-quarters of a mile."
4839,THE COMFORTERS,I'd defy any one to resist it. We rooked seventy pounds out of 'em last
4840,THE COMFORTERS,month. No car can resist the temptation. You ought to have one your side
4841,THE COMFORTERS,"the county, Mike. They simply can't resist it.'"
4842,THE COMFORTERS,
4843,THE COMFORTERS,'Whew!' said Woodhouse. 'We're in for trouble. Don't you say a word--or
4844,THE COMFORTERS,Ollyett either! I'll pay the fines and we'll get it over as soon as
4845,THE COMFORTERS,possible. Where's Pallant?'
4846,THE COMFORTERS,
4847,THE COMFORTERS,"'At the back of the court somewhere,' said Ollyett. 'I saw him slip in"
4848,THE COMFORTERS,just now.'
4849,THE COMFORTERS,
4850,THE COMFORTERS,"The fat man then took his seat on the Bench, of which he was chairman,"
4851,THE COMFORTERS,"and I gathered from a bystander that his name was Sir Thomas Ingell,"
4852,THE COMFORTERS,"Bart., M.P., of Ingell Park, Huckley. He began with an allocution"
4853,THE COMFORTERS,pitched in a tone that would have justified revolt throughout empires.
4854,THE COMFORTERS,"Evidence, when the crowded little court did not drown it with applause,"
4855,THE COMFORTERS,was given in the pauses of the address. They were all very proud of
4856,THE COMFORTERS,"their Sir Thomas, and looked from him to us, wondering why we did not"
4857,THE COMFORTERS,applaud too.
4858,THE COMFORTERS,
4859,THE COMFORTERS,"Taking its time from the chairman, the Bench rollicked with us for"
4860,THE COMFORTERS,seventeen minutes. Sir Thomas explained that he was sick and tired of
4861,THE COMFORTERS,"processions of cads of our type, who would be better employed breaking"
4862,THE COMFORTERS,stones on the road than in frightening horses worth more than themselves
4863,THE COMFORTERS,or their ancestors. This was after it had been proved that Woodhouse's
4864,THE COMFORTERS,"man had turned on the horn purposely to annoy Sir Thomas, who happened"
4865,THE COMFORTERS,"to be riding by'! There were other remarks too--primitive enough,--but"
4866,THE COMFORTERS,"it was the unspeakable brutality of the tone, even more than the quality"
4867,THE COMFORTERS,"of the justice, or the laughter of the audience that stung our souls out"
4868,THE COMFORTERS,of all reason. When we were dismissed--to the tune of twenty-three
4869,THE COMFORTERS,"pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence--we waited for Pallant to join us,"
4870,THE COMFORTERS,while we listened to the next case--one of driving without a licence.
4871,THE COMFORTERS,"Ollyett with an eye to his evening paper, had already taken very full"
4872,THE COMFORTERS,"notes of our own, but we did not wish to seem prejudiced."
4873,THE COMFORTERS,
4874,THE COMFORTERS,"'It's all right,' said the reporter of the local paper soothingly. 'We"
4875,THE COMFORTERS,never report Sir Thomas _in extenso_. Only the fines and charges.'
4876,THE COMFORTERS,
4877,THE COMFORTERS,"'Oh, thank you,' Ollyett replied, and I heard him ask who every one in"
4878,THE COMFORTERS,court might be. The local reporter was very communicative.
4879,THE COMFORTERS,
4880,THE COMFORTERS,"The new victim, a large, flaxen-haired man in somewhat striking"
4881,THE COMFORTERS,"clothes, to which Sir Thomas, now thoroughly warmed, drew public"
4882,THE COMFORTERS,"attention, said that he had left his licence at home. Sir Thomas asked"
4883,THE COMFORTERS,him if he expected the police to go to his home address at Jerusalem to
4884,THE COMFORTERS,find it for him; and the court roared. Nor did Sir Thomas approve of the
4885,THE COMFORTERS,"man's name, but insisted on calling him 'Mr. Masquerader,' and every"
4886,THE COMFORTERS,"time he did so, all his people shouted. Evidently this was their"
4887,THE COMFORTERS,established _auto-da-fÃ©_.
4888,THE COMFORTERS,
4889,THE COMFORTERS,"'He didn't summons me--because I'm in the House, I suppose. I think I"
4890,THE COMFORTERS,"shall have to ask a Question,' said Pallant, reappearing at the close"
4891,THE COMFORTERS,of the case.
4892,THE COMFORTERS,
4893,THE COMFORTERS,"'I think _I_ shall have to give it a little publicity too,' said"
4894,THE COMFORTERS,"Woodhouse. 'We can't have this kind of thing going on, you know.' His"
4895,THE COMFORTERS,"face was set and quite white. Pallant's, on the other hand, was black,"
4896,THE COMFORTERS,and I know that my very stomach had turned with rage. Ollyett was dum.
4897,THE COMFORTERS,
4898,THE COMFORTERS,"'Well, let's have lunch,' Woodhouse said at last. 'Then we can get away"
4899,THE COMFORTERS,before the show breaks up.'
4900,THE COMFORTERS,
4901,THE COMFORTERS,"We drew Ollyett from the arms of the local reporter, crossed the Market"
4902,THE COMFORTERS,Square to the Red Lion and found Sir Thomas's 'Mr. Masquerader' just
4903,THE COMFORTERS,"sitting down to beer, beef and pickles."
4904,THE COMFORTERS,
4905,THE COMFORTERS,"'Ah!' said he, in a large voice. 'Companions in misfortune. Won't you"
4906,THE COMFORTERS,gentlemen join me?'
4907,THE COMFORTERS,
4908,THE COMFORTERS,"'Delighted,' said Woodhouse. 'What did you get?'"
4909,THE COMFORTERS,
4910,THE COMFORTERS,"'I haven't decided. It might make a good turn, but--the public aren't"
4911,THE COMFORTERS,"educated up to it yet. It's beyond 'em. If it wasn't, that red dub on"
4912,THE COMFORTERS,the Bench would be worth fifty a week.'
4913,THE COMFORTERS,
4914,THE COMFORTERS,'Where?' said Woodhouse. The man looked at him with unaffected surprise.
4915,THE COMFORTERS,
4916,THE COMFORTERS,"'At any one of My places,' he replied. 'But perhaps you live here?'"
4917,THE COMFORTERS,
4918,THE COMFORTERS,"'Good heavens!' cried young Ollyett suddenly. 'You _are_ Masquerier,"
4919,THE COMFORTERS,then? I thought you were!'
4920,THE COMFORTERS,
4921,THE COMFORTERS,'Bat Masquerier.' He let the words fall with the weight of an
4922,THE COMFORTERS,"international ultimatum. 'Yes, that's all I am. But you have the"
4923,THE COMFORTERS,"advantage of me, gentlemen.'"
4924,THE COMFORTERS,
4925,THE COMFORTERS,"For the moment, while we were introducing ourselves, I was puzzled. Then"
4926,THE COMFORTERS,I recalled prismatic music-hall posters--of enormous acreage--that had
4927,THE COMFORTERS,been the unnoticed background of my visits to London for years past.
4928,THE COMFORTERS,"Posters of men and women, singers, jongleurs, impersonators and"
4929,THE COMFORTERS,"audacities of every draped and undraped brand, all moved on and off in"
4930,THE COMFORTERS,London and the Provinces by Bat Masquerier--with the long wedge-tailed
4931,THE COMFORTERS,flourish following the final 'r.'
4932,THE COMFORTERS,
4933,THE COMFORTERS,"'_I_ knew you at once,' said Pallant, the trained M.P., and I promptly"
4934,THE COMFORTERS,backed the lie. Woodhouse mumbled excuses. Bat Masquerier was not moved
4935,THE COMFORTERS,for or against us any more than the frontage of one of his own palaces.
4936,THE COMFORTERS,
4937,THE COMFORTERS,"'I always tell My people there's a limit to the size of the lettering,'"
4938,THE COMFORTERS,he said. 'Overdo that and the ret'na doesn't take it in. Advertisin' is
4939,THE COMFORTERS,the most delicate of all the sciences.'
4940,THE COMFORTERS,
4941,THE COMFORTERS,'There's one man in the world who is going to get a little of it if I
4942,THE COMFORTERS,"live for the next twenty-four hours,' said Woodhouse, and explained how"
4943,THE COMFORTERS,this would come about.
4944,THE COMFORTERS,
4945,THE COMFORTERS,Masquerier stared at him lengthily with gunmetal-blue eyes.
4946,THE COMFORTERS,
4947,THE COMFORTERS,'You mean it?' he drawled; the voice was as magnetic as the look.
4948,THE COMFORTERS,
4949,THE COMFORTERS,"'_I_ do,' said Ollyett. 'That business of the horn alone ought to have"
4950,THE COMFORTERS,him off the Bench in three months.' Masquerier looked at him even longer
4951,THE COMFORTERS,than he had looked at Woodhouse.
4952,THE COMFORTERS,
4953,THE COMFORTERS,"'He told _me_,' he said suddenly, 'that my home-address was Jerusalem."
4954,THE COMFORTERS,You heard that?'
4955,THE COMFORTERS,
4956,THE COMFORTERS,"'But it was the tone--the tone,' Ollyett cried."
4957,THE COMFORTERS,
4958,THE COMFORTERS,"'You noticed that, too, did you?' said Masquerier. 'That's the artistic"
4959,THE COMFORTERS,"temperament. You can do a lot with it. And I'm Bat Masquerier,' he went"
4960,THE COMFORTERS,on. He dropped his chin in his fists and scowled straight in front of
4961,THE COMFORTERS,him.... 'I made the Silhouettes--I made the Trefoil and the Jocunda. I
4962,THE COMFORTERS,"made 'Dal Benzaguen.' Here Ollyett sat straight up, for in common with"
4963,THE COMFORTERS,the youth of that year he worshipped Miss Vidal Benzaguen of the Trefoil
4964,THE COMFORTERS,"immensely and unreservedly. '""_Is_ that a dressing-gown or an ulster"
4965,THE COMFORTERS,"you're supposed to be wearing?"" You heard _that_?... ""And I suppose you"
4966,THE COMFORTERS,"hadn't time to brush your hair either?"" You heard _that_?... Now, you"
4967,THE COMFORTERS,"hear _me_!' His voice filled the coffee-room, then dropped to a whisper"
4968,THE COMFORTERS,as dreadful as a surgeon's before an operation. He spoke for several
4969,THE COMFORTERS,minutes. Pallant muttered 'Hear! hear!' I saw Ollyett's eye flash--it
4970,THE COMFORTERS,"was to Ollyett that Masquerier addressed himself chiefly,--and"
4971,THE COMFORTERS,Woodhouse leaned forward with joined hands.
4972,THE COMFORTERS,
4973,THE COMFORTERS,"'Are you _with_ me?' he went on, gathering us all up in one sweep of the"
4974,THE COMFORTERS,"arm. 'When I begin a thing I see it through, gentlemen. What Bat can't"
4975,THE COMFORTERS,"break, breaks him! But I haven't struck that thing yet. This is no"
4976,THE COMFORTERS,one-turn turn-it-down show. This is business to the dead finish. Are you
4977,THE COMFORTERS,"with me, gentlemen? Good! Now, we'll pool our assets. One London"
4978,THE COMFORTERS,"morning, and one provincial daily, didn't you say? One weekly commercial"
4979,THE COMFORTERS,ditto and one M.P.'
4980,THE COMFORTERS,
4981,THE COMFORTERS,"'Not much use, I'm afraid,' Pallant smirked."
4982,THE COMFORTERS,
4983,THE COMFORTERS,"'But privileged. _But_ privileged,' he returned. 'And we have also my"
4984,THE COMFORTERS,"little team--London, Blackburn, Liverpool, Leeds--I'll tell you about"
4985,THE COMFORTERS,Manchester later--and Me! Bat Masquerier.' He breathed the name
4986,THE COMFORTERS,"reverently into his tankard. 'Gentlemen, when our combination has"
4987,THE COMFORTERS,"finished with Sir Thomas Ingell, Bart., M.P., and everything else that"
4988,THE COMFORTERS,"is his, Sodom and Gomorrah will be a winsome bit of Merrie England"
4989,THE COMFORTERS,"beside 'em. I must go back to town now, but I trust you gentlemen will"
4990,THE COMFORTERS,give me the pleasure of your company at dinner to-night at the Chop
4991,THE COMFORTERS,Suey--the Red Amber Room--and we'll block out the scenario.' He laid his
4992,THE COMFORTERS,hand on young Ollyett's shoulder and added: 'It's your brains I want.'
4993,THE COMFORTERS,"Then he left, in a good deal of astrachan collar and nickel-plated"
4994,THE COMFORTERS,"limousine, and the place felt less crowded."
4995,THE COMFORTERS,
4996,THE COMFORTERS,"We ordered our car a few minutes later. As Woodhouse, Ollyett and I were"
4997,THE COMFORTERS,"getting in, Sir Thomas Ingell, Bart., M.P., came out of the Hall of"
4998,THE COMFORTERS,Justice across the square and mounted his horse. I have sometimes
4999,THE COMFORTERS,thought that if he had gone in silence he might even then have been
5000,THE COMFORTERS,"saved, but as he settled himself in the saddle he caught sight of us and"
5001,THE COMFORTERS,must needs shout: 'Not off yet? You'd better get away and you'd better
5002,THE COMFORTERS,"be careful.' At that moment Pallant, who had been buying"
5003,THE COMFORTERS,"picture-postcards, came out of the inn, took Sir Thomas's eye and very"
5004,THE COMFORTERS,leisurely entered the car. It seemed to me that for one instant there
5005,THE COMFORTERS,was a shade of uneasiness on the baronet's grey-whiskered face.
5006,THE COMFORTERS,
5007,THE COMFORTERS,"'I hope,' said Woodhouse after several miles, 'I hope he's a widower.'"
5008,THE COMFORTERS,
5009,THE COMFORTERS,"'Yes,' said Pallant. 'For his poor, dear wife's sake I hope that, very"
5010,THE COMFORTERS,"much indeed. I suppose he didn't see me in Court. Oh, here's the parish"
5011,THE COMFORTERS,history of Huckley written by the Rector and here's your share of the
5012,THE COMFORTERS,picture-postcards. Are we all dining with this Mr. Masquerier to-night?'
5013,THE COMFORTERS,
5014,THE COMFORTERS,'Yes!' said we all.
5015,THE COMFORTERS,
5016,THE COMFORTERS,*       *       *       *       *
5017,THE COMFORTERS,
5018,THE COMFORTERS,"If Woodhouse knew nothing of journalism, young Ollyett, who had"
5019,THE COMFORTERS,"graduated in a hard school, knew a good deal. Our halfpenny evening"
5020,THE COMFORTERS,"paper, which we will call _The Bun_ to distinguish her from her"
5021,THE COMFORTERS,"prosperous morning sister, _The Cake_, was not only diseased but"
5022,THE COMFORTERS,corrupt. We found this out when a man brought us the prospectus of a new
5023,THE COMFORTERS,oil-field and demanded sub-leaders on its prosperity. Ollyett talked
5024,THE COMFORTERS,pure Brasenose to him for three minutes. Otherwise he spoke and wrote
5025,THE COMFORTERS,trade-English--a toothsome amalgam of Americanisms and epigrams. But
5026,THE COMFORTERS,"though the slang changes the game never alters, and Ollyett and I and,"
5027,THE COMFORTERS,"in the end, some others enjoyed it immensely. It was weeks ere we could"
5028,THE COMFORTERS,"see the wood for the trees, but so soon as the staff realised that they"
5029,THE COMFORTERS,"had proprietors who backed them right or wrong, and specially when they"
5030,THE COMFORTERS,"were wrong (which is the sole secret of journalism), and that their fate"
5031,THE COMFORTERS,"did not hang on any passing owner's passing mood, they did miracles."
5032,THE COMFORTERS,
5033,THE COMFORTERS,But we did not neglect Huckley. As Ollyett said our first care was to
5034,THE COMFORTERS,create an 'arresting atmosphere' round it. He used to visit the village
5035,THE COMFORTERS,"of week-ends, on a motor-bicycle with a side-car; for which reason I"
5036,THE COMFORTERS,left the actual place alone and dealt with it in the abstract. Yet it
5037,THE COMFORTERS,was I who drew first blood. Two inhabitants of Huckley wrote to
5038,THE COMFORTERS,"contradict a small, quite solid paragraph in _The Bun_ that a hoopoe had"
5039,THE COMFORTERS,"been seen at Huckley and had, 'of course, been shot by the local"
5040,THE COMFORTERS,"sportsmen.' There was some heat in their letters, both of which we"
5041,THE COMFORTERS,published. Our version of how the hoopoe got his crest from King Solomon
5042,THE COMFORTERS,"was, I grieve to say, so inaccurate that the Rector himself--no"
5043,THE COMFORTERS,"sportsman as he pointed out, but a lover of accuracy--wrote to us to"
5044,THE COMFORTERS,correct it. We gave his letter good space and thanked him.
5045,THE COMFORTERS,
5046,THE COMFORTERS,"'This priest is going to be useful,' said Ollyett. 'He has the impartial"
5047,THE COMFORTERS,mind. I shall vitalise him.'
5048,THE COMFORTERS,
5049,THE COMFORTERS,"Forthwith he created M.L. Sigden, a recluse of refined tastes who in"
5050,THE COMFORTERS,_The Bun_ demanded to know whether this Huckley-of-the-Hoopoe was the
5051,THE COMFORTERS,"Hugly of his boyhood and whether, by any chance, the fell change of name"
5052,THE COMFORTERS,"had been wrought by collusion between a local magnate and the railway,"
5053,THE COMFORTERS,in the mistaken interests of spurious refinement. 'For I knew it and
5054,THE COMFORTERS,"loved it with the maidens of my day--_eheu ab angulo!_--as Hugly,' wrote"
5055,THE COMFORTERS,M.L. Sigden from Oxf.
5056,THE COMFORTERS,
5057,THE COMFORTERS,"Though other papers scoffed, _The Bun_ was gravely sympathetic. Several"
5058,THE COMFORTERS,people wrote to deny that Huckley had been changed at birth. Only the
5059,THE COMFORTERS,"Rector--no philosopher as he pointed out, but a lover of accuracy--had"
5060,THE COMFORTERS,"his doubts, which he laid publicly before Mr. M.L. Sigden who suggested,"
5061,THE COMFORTERS,"through _The Bun_, that the little place might have begun life in"
5062,THE COMFORTERS,"Anglo-Saxon days as 'Hogslea' or among the Normans as 'ArgilÃ©,' on"
5063,THE COMFORTERS,account of its much clay. The Rector had his own ideas too (he said it
5064,THE COMFORTERS,"was mostly gravel), and M.L. Sigden had a fund of reminiscences. Oddly"
5065,THE COMFORTERS,enough--which is seldom the case with free reading-matter--our
5066,THE COMFORTERS,"subscribers rather relished the correspondence, and contemporaries"
5067,THE COMFORTERS,quoted freely.
5068,THE COMFORTERS,
5069,THE COMFORTERS,"'The secret of power,' said Ollyett, 'is not the big stick. It's the"
5070,THE COMFORTERS,liftable stick.' (This means the 'arresting' quotation of six or seven
5071,THE COMFORTERS,"lines.) 'Did you see the _Spec._ had a middle on ""Rural Tenacities"" last"
5072,THE COMFORTERS,"week. That was all Huckley. I'm doing a ""Mobiquity"" on Huckley"
5073,THE COMFORTERS,next week.'
5074,THE COMFORTERS,
5075,THE COMFORTERS,Our 'Mobiquities' were Friday evening accounts of easy
5076,THE COMFORTERS,"motor-bike-_cum_-side-car trips round London, illustrated (we could"
5077,THE COMFORTERS,never get that machine to work properly) by smudgy maps. Ollyett wrote
5078,THE COMFORTERS,the stuff with a fervour and a delicacy which I always ascribed to the
5079,THE COMFORTERS,"side-car. His account of Epping Forest, for instance, was simply young"
5080,THE COMFORTERS,love with its soul at its lips. But his Huckley 'Mobiquity' would have
5081,THE COMFORTERS,"sickened a soap-boiler. It chemically combined loathsome familiarity,"
5082,THE COMFORTERS,"leering suggestion, slimy piety and rancid 'social service' in one"
5083,THE COMFORTERS,fuming compost that fairly lifted me off my feet.
5084,THE COMFORTERS,
5085,THE COMFORTERS,"'Yes,' said he, after compliments. 'It's the most vital, arresting and"
5086,THE COMFORTERS,dynamic bit of tump I've done up to date. _Non nobis gloria!_ I met Sir
5087,THE COMFORTERS,Thomas Ingell in his own park. He talked to me again. He inspired
5088,THE COMFORTERS,most of it.'
5089,THE COMFORTERS,
5090,THE COMFORTERS,"'Which? The ""glutinous native drawl,"" or ""the neglected adenoids of the"
5091,THE COMFORTERS,"village children""?' I demanded."
5092,THE COMFORTERS,
5093,THE COMFORTERS,"'Oh, no! That's only to bring in the panel doctor. It's the last flight"
5094,THE COMFORTERS,we--I'm proudest of.'
5095,THE COMFORTERS,
5096,THE COMFORTERS,This dealt with 'the crepuscular penumbra spreading her dim limbs over
5097,THE COMFORTERS,the boskage'; with 'jolly rabbits'; with a herd of 'gravid polled
5098,THE COMFORTERS,"Angus'; and with the 'arresting, gipsy-like face of their swart,"
5099,THE COMFORTERS,scholarly owner--as well known at the Royal Agricultural Shows as that
5100,THE COMFORTERS,of our late King-Emperor.'
5101,THE COMFORTERS,
5102,THE COMFORTERS,"'""Swart"" is good and so's ""gravid,""' said I, 'but the panel doctor will"
5103,THE COMFORTERS,be annoyed about the adenoids.'
5104,THE COMFORTERS,
5105,THE COMFORTERS,"'Not half as much as Sir Thomas will about his face,' said Ollyett. 'And"
5106,THE COMFORTERS,if you only knew what I've left out!'
5107,THE COMFORTERS,
5108,THE COMFORTERS,He was right. The panel doctor spent his week-end (this is the
5109,THE COMFORTERS,advantage of Friday articles) in overwhelming us with a professional
5110,THE COMFORTERS,"counterblast of no interest whatever to our subscribers. We told him so,"
5111,THE COMFORTERS,"and he, then and there, battered his way with it into the _Lancet_ where"
5112,THE COMFORTERS,"they are keen on glands, and forgot us altogether. But Sir Thomas Ingell"
5113,THE COMFORTERS,was of sterner stuff. He must have spent a happy week-end too. The
5114,THE COMFORTERS,letter which we received from him on Monday proved him to be a kinless
5115,THE COMFORTERS,"loon of upright life, for no woman, however remotely interested in a man"
5116,THE COMFORTERS,would have let it pass the home wastepaper-basket. He objected to our
5117,THE COMFORTERS,"references to his own herd, to his own labours in his own village, which"
5118,THE COMFORTERS,"he said was a Model Village, and to our infernal insolence; but he"
5119,THE COMFORTERS,objected most to our invoice of his features. We wrote him courtously to
5120,THE COMFORTERS,"ask whether the letter was meant for publication. He, remembering, I"
5121,THE COMFORTERS,"presume, the Duke of Wellington, wrote back, 'publish and be damned.'"
5122,THE COMFORTERS,
5123,THE COMFORTERS,"'Oh! This is too easy,' Ollyett said as he began heading the letter."
5124,THE COMFORTERS,
5125,THE COMFORTERS,"'Stop a minute,' I said. 'The game is getting a little beyond us."
5126,THE COMFORTERS,To-night's the Bat dinner.' (I may have forgotten to tell you that our
5127,THE COMFORTERS,dinner with Bat Masquerier in the Red Amber Room of the Chop Suey had
5128,THE COMFORTERS,come to be a weekly affair.) 'Hold it over till they've all seen it.'
5129,THE COMFORTERS,
5130,THE COMFORTERS,"'Perhaps you're right,' he said. 'You might waste it.'"
5131,THE COMFORTERS,
5132,THE COMFORTERS,"At dinner, then, Sir Thomas's letter was handed round. Bat seemed to be"
5133,THE COMFORTERS,"thinking of other matters, but Pallant was very interested."
5134,THE COMFORTERS,
5135,THE COMFORTERS,"'I've got an idea,' he said presently. 'Could you put something into"
5136,THE COMFORTERS,_The Bun_ to-morrow about foot-and-mouth disease in that fellow's herd?'
5137,THE COMFORTERS,
5138,THE COMFORTERS,"'Oh, plague if you like,' Ollyett replied. 'They're only five measly"
5139,THE COMFORTERS,Shorthorns. I saw one lying down in the park. She'll serve as a
5140,THE COMFORTERS,sub-stratum of fact.'
5141,THE COMFORTERS,
5142,THE COMFORTERS,"'Then, do that; and hold the letter over meanwhile. I think _I_ come in"
5143,THE COMFORTERS,"here,' said Pallant."
5144,THE COMFORTERS,
5145,THE COMFORTERS,'Why?' said I.
5146,THE COMFORTERS,
5147,THE COMFORTERS,"'Because there's something coming up in the House about foot-and-mouth,"
5148,THE COMFORTERS,and because he wrote me a letter after that little affair when he fined
5149,THE COMFORTERS,"you. 'Took ten days to think it over. Here you are,' said Pallant."
5150,THE COMFORTERS,"'House of Commons paper, you see.'"
5151,THE COMFORTERS,
5152,THE COMFORTERS,We read:
5153,THE COMFORTERS,
5154,THE COMFORTERS,DEAR PALLANT--Although in the past our paths have not lain
5155,THE COMFORTERS,"much together, I am sure you will agree with me that on the"
5156,THE COMFORTERS,floor of the House all members are on a footing of equality.
5157,THE COMFORTERS,"I make bold, therefore, to approach you in a matter which I"
5158,THE COMFORTERS,think capable of a very different interpretation from that
5159,THE COMFORTERS,which perhaps was put upon it by your friends. Will you let
5160,THE COMFORTERS,them know that that was the case and that I was in no way
5161,THE COMFORTERS,"swayed by animus in the exercise of my magisterial duties,"
5162,THE COMFORTERS,"which as you, as a brother magistrate, can imagine are"
5163,THE COMFORTERS,"frequently very distasteful to--Yours very sincerely,"
5164,THE COMFORTERS,
5165,T. INGELL.,T. INGELL.
5166,T. INGELL.,
5167,T. INGELL.,_P.S._--I have seen to it that the motor vigilance to which
5168,T. INGELL.,your friends took exception has been considerably relaxed in
5169,T. INGELL.,my district.
5170,T. INGELL.,
5171,T. INGELL.,"'What did you answer?' said Ollyett, when all our opinions had been"
5172,T. INGELL.,expressed.
5173,T. INGELL.,
5174,T. INGELL.,'I told him I couldn't do anything in the matter. And I couldn't--then.
5175,T. INGELL.,But you'll remember to put in that foot-and-mouth paragraph. I want
5176,T. INGELL.,something to work upon.'
5177,T. INGELL.,
5178,T. INGELL.,"'It seems to me _The Bun_ has done all the work up to date,' I"
5179,T. INGELL.,suggested. 'When does _The Cake_ come in?'
5180,T. INGELL.,
5181,T. INGELL.,"'_The Cake_,' said Woodhouse, and I remembered afterwards that he spoke"
5182,T. INGELL.,"like a Cabinet Minister on the eve of a Budget, 'reserves to itself the"
5183,T. INGELL.,fullest right to deal with situations as they arise.'
5184,T. INGELL.,
5185,T. INGELL.,"'Ye-eh!' Bat Masquerier shook himself out of his thoughts. '""Situations"
5186,T. INGELL.,"as they arise."" I ain't idle either. But there's no use fishing till the"
5187,T. INGELL.,swim's baited. You'--he turned to Ollyett--'manufacture very good
5188,T. INGELL.,ground-bait.... I always tell My people--What the deuce is that?'
5189,T. INGELL.,
5190,T. INGELL.,There was a burst of song from another private dining-room across the
5191,T. INGELL.,"landing. 'It ees some ladies from the Trefoil,' the waiter began."
5192,T. INGELL.,
5193,T. INGELL.,"'Oh, I know that. What are they singing, though?'"
5194,T. INGELL.,
5195,T. INGELL.,"He rose and went out, to be greeted by shouts of applause from that"
5196,T. INGELL.,"merry company. Then there was silence, such as one hears in the"
5197,T. INGELL.,form-room after a master's entry. Then a voice that we loved began
5198,T. INGELL.,again: 'Here we go gathering nuts in May--nuts in May--nuts in May!'
5199,T. INGELL.,
5200,T. INGELL.,"'It's only 'Dal--and some nuts,' he explained when he returned. 'She"
5201,T. INGELL.,"says she's coming in to dessert.' He sat down, humming the old tune to"
5202,T. INGELL.,"himself, and till Miss Vidal Benzaguen entered, he held us speechless"
5203,T. INGELL.,with tales of the artistic temperament.
5204,T. INGELL.,
5205,T. INGELL.,We obeyed Pallant to the extent of slipping into _The Bun_ a wary
5206,T. INGELL.,"paragraph about cows lying down and dripping at the mouth, which might"
5207,T. INGELL.,"be read either as an unkind libel or, in the hands of a capable lawyer,"
5208,T. INGELL.,as a piece of faithful nature-study.
5209,T. INGELL.,
5210,T. INGELL.,"'And besides,' said Ollyett, 'we allude to ""gravid polled Angus."" I am"
5211,T. INGELL.,advised that no action can lie in respect of virgin Shorthorns. Pallant
5212,T. INGELL.,wants us to come to the House to-night. He's got us places for the
5213,T. INGELL.,Strangers' Gallery. I'm beginning to like Pallant.'
5214,T. INGELL.,
5215,T. INGELL.,"'Masquerier seems to like you,' I said."
5216,T. INGELL.,
5217,T. INGELL.,"'Yes, but I'm afraid of him,' Ollyett answered with perfect sincerity."
5218,T. INGELL.,'I am. He's the Absolutely Amoral Soul. I've never met one yet.'
5219,T. INGELL.,
5220,T. INGELL.,"We went to the House together. It happened to be an Irish afternoon, and"
5221,T. INGELL.,"as soon as I had got the cries and the faces a little sorted out, I"
5222,T. INGELL.,"gathered there were grievances in the air, but how many of them was"
5223,T. INGELL.,beyond me.
5224,T. INGELL.,
5225,T. INGELL.,"'It's all right,' said Ollyett of the trained ear. 'They've shut their"
5226,T. INGELL.,ports against--oh yes--export of Irish cattle! Foot-and-mouth disease at
5227,T. INGELL.,Ballyhellion. _I_ see Pallant's idea!'
5228,T. INGELL.,
5229,T. INGELL.,"The House was certainly all mouth for the moment, but, as I could feel,"
5230,T. INGELL.,quite in earnest. A Minister with a piece of typewritten paper seemed to
5231,T. INGELL.,be fending off volleys of insults. He reminded me somehow of a nervous
5232,T. INGELL.,huntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds.
5233,T. INGELL.,
5234,T. INGELL.,"'It's question-time. They're asking questions,' said Ollyett. 'Look!"
5235,T. INGELL.,Pallant's up.'
5236,T. INGELL.,
5237,T. INGELL.,"There was no mistaking it. His voice, which his enemies said was his one"
5238,T. INGELL.,"parliamentary asset, silenced the hubbub as toothache silences mere"
5239,T. INGELL.,singing in the ears. He said:
5240,T. INGELL.,
5241,T. INGELL.,"'Arising out of that, may I ask if any special consideration has"
5242,T. INGELL.,recently been shown in regard to any suspected outbreak of this disease
5243,T. INGELL.,on _this_ side of the Channel?'
5244,T. INGELL.,
5245,T. INGELL.,He raised his hand; it held a noon edition of _The Bun_. We had thought
5246,T. INGELL.,it best to drop the paragraph out of the later ones. He would have
5247,T. INGELL.,"continued, but something in a grey frock-coat roared and bounded on a"
5248,T. INGELL.,"bench opposite, and waved another _Bun_. It was Sir Thomas Ingell."
5249,T. INGELL.,
5250,T. INGELL.,'As the owner of the herd so dastardly implicated--' His voice was
5251,T. INGELL.,drowned in shouts of 'Order!'--the Irish leading.
5252,T. INGELL.,
5253,T. INGELL.,"'What's wrong?' I asked Ollyett. 'He's got his hat on his head, hasn't"
5254,T. INGELL.,he?'
5255,T. INGELL.,
5256,T. INGELL.,"'Yes, but his wrath should have been put as a question.'"
5257,T. INGELL.,
5258,T. INGELL.,"'Arising out of that, Mr. Speaker, Sirrr!' Sir Thomas bellowed through a"
5259,T. INGELL.,"lull, 'are you aware that--that all this is a conspiracy--part of a"
5260,T. INGELL.,dastardly conspiracy to make Huckley ridiculous--to make _us_
5261,T. INGELL.,"ridiculous? Part of a deep-laid plot to make _me_ ridiculous, Mr."
5262,T. INGELL.,"Speaker, Sir!'"
5263,T. INGELL.,
5264,T. INGELL.,"The man's face showed almost black against his white whiskers, and he"
5265,T. INGELL.,struck out swimmingly with his arms. His vehemence puzzled and held the
5266,T. INGELL.,"House for an instant, and the Speaker took advantage of it to lift his"
5267,T. INGELL.,pack from Ireland to a new scent. He addressed Sir Thomas Ingell in
5268,T. INGELL.,"tones of measured rebuke, meant also, I imagine, for the whole House,"
5269,T. INGELL.,"which lowered its hackles at the word. Then Pallant, shocked and pained:"
5270,T. INGELL.,'I can only express my profound surprise that in response to my simple
5271,T. INGELL.,question the honourable member should have thought fit to indulge in a
5272,T. INGELL.,personal attack. If I have in any way offended--'
5273,T. INGELL.,
5274,T. INGELL.,"Again the Speaker intervened, for it appeared that he regulated these"
5275,T. INGELL.,matters.
5276,T. INGELL.,
5277,T. INGELL.,"He, too, expressed surprise, and Sir Thomas sat back in a hush of"
5278,T. INGELL.,reprobation that seemed to have the chill of the centuries behind it.
5279,T. INGELL.,The Empire's work was resumed.
5280,T. INGELL.,
5281,T. INGELL.,"'Beautiful!' said I, and I felt hot and cold up my back."
5282,T. INGELL.,
5283,T. INGELL.,"'And now we'll publish his letter,' said Ollyett."
5284,T. INGELL.,
5285,T. INGELL.,We did--on the heels of his carefully reported outburst. We made no
5286,T. INGELL.,comment. With that rare instinct for grasping the heart of a situation
5287,T. INGELL.,"which is the mark of the Anglo-Saxon, all our contemporaries and, I"
5288,T. INGELL.,"should say, two-thirds of our correspondents demanded how such a person"
5289,T. INGELL.,could be made more ridiculous than he had already proved himself to be.
5290,T. INGELL.,"But beyond spelling his name 'Injle,' we alone refused to hit a man when"
5291,T. INGELL.,he was down.
5292,T. INGELL.,
5293,T. INGELL.,"'There's no need,' said Ollyett. 'The whole press is on the huckle from"
5294,T. INGELL.,end to end.'
5295,T. INGELL.,
5296,T. INGELL.,Even Woodhouse was a little astonished at the ease with which it had
5297,T. INGELL.,"come about, and said as much."
5298,T. INGELL.,
5299,T. INGELL.,'Rot!' said Ollyett. 'We haven't really begun. Huckley isn't news yet.'
5300,T. INGELL.,
5301,T. INGELL.,"'What do you mean?' said Woodhouse, who had grown to have great respect"
5302,T. INGELL.,for his young but by no means distant connection.
5303,T. INGELL.,
5304,T. INGELL.,"'Mean? By the grace of God, Master Ridley, I mean to have it so that"
5305,T. INGELL.,"when Huckley turns over in its sleep, Reuters and the Press Association"
5306,T. INGELL.,jump out of bed to cable.' Then he went off at score about certain
5307,T. INGELL.,"restorations in Huckley Church which, he said--and he seemed to spend"
5308,T. INGELL.,his every week-end there--had been perpetrated by the Rector's
5309,T. INGELL.,"predecessor, who had abolished a 'leper-window' or a 'squinch-hole'"
5310,T. INGELL.,(whatever these may be) to institute a lavatory in the vestry. It did
5311,T. INGELL.,not strike me as stuff for which Reuters or the Press Association would
5312,T. INGELL.,"lose much sleep, and I left him declaiming to Woodhouse about a"
5313,T. INGELL.,"fourteenth-century font which, he said, he had unearthed in the sexton's"
5314,T. INGELL.,tool-shed.
5315,T. INGELL.,
5316,T. INGELL.,"My methods were more on the lines of peaceful penetration. An odd copy,"
5317,T. INGELL.,"in _The Bun's_ rag-and-bone library, of Hone's _Every-Day Book_ had"
5318,T. INGELL.,"revealed to me the existence of a village dance founded, like all"
5319,T. INGELL.,"village dances, on Druidical mysteries connected with the Solar Solstice"
5320,T. INGELL.,"(which is always unchallengeable) and Mid-summer Morning, which is dewy"
5321,T. INGELL.,and refreshing to the London eye. For this I take no credit--Hone being
5322,T. INGELL.,"a mine any one can work--but that I rechristened that dance, after I"
5323,T. INGELL.,"had revised it, 'The Gubby' is my title to immortal fame. It was still"
5324,T. INGELL.,"to be witnessed, I wrote, 'in all its poignant purity at Huckley, that"
5325,T. INGELL.,last home of significant mediÃ¦val survivals'; and I fell so in love with
5326,T. INGELL.,"my creation that I kept it back for days, enamelling and burnishing."
5327,T. INGELL.,
5328,T. INGELL.,"'You's better put it in,' said Ollyett at last. 'It's time we asserted"
5329,T. INGELL.,ourselves again. The other fellows are beginning to poach. You saw that
5330,T. INGELL.,thing in the _Pinnacle_ about Sir Thomas's Model Village? He must have
5331,T. INGELL.,got one of their chaps down to do it.'
5332,T. INGELL.,
5333,T. INGELL.,"''Nothing like the wounds of a friend,' I said. 'That account of the"
5334,T. INGELL.,non-alcoholic pub alone was--'
5335,T. INGELL.,
5336,T. INGELL.,'I liked the bit best about the white-tiled laundry and the Fallen
5337,T. INGELL.,Virgins who wash Sir Thomas's dress shirts. Our side couldn't come
5338,T. INGELL.,"within a mile of that, you know. We haven't the proper flair for"
5339,T. INGELL.,sexual slobber.'
5340,T. INGELL.,
5341,T. INGELL.,"'That's what I'm always saying,' I retorted. 'Leave 'em alone. The other"
5342,T. INGELL.,fellows are doing our work for us now. Besides I want to touch up my
5343,T. INGELL.,"""Gubby Dance"" a little more.'"
5344,T. INGELL.,
5345,T. INGELL.,'No. You'll spoil it. Let's shove it in to-day. For one thing it's
5346,T. INGELL.,"Literature. I don't go in for compliments as you know, but, etc. etc.'"
5347,T. INGELL.,
5348,T. INGELL.,"I had a healthy suspicion of young Ollyett in every aspect, but though I"
5349,T. INGELL.,"knew that I should have to pay for it, I fell to his flattery, and my"
5350,T. INGELL.,priceless article on the 'Gubby Dance' appeared. Next Saturday he asked
5351,T. INGELL.,"me to bring out _The Bun_ in his absence, which I naturally assumed"
5352,T. INGELL.,would be connected with the little maroon side-car. I was wrong.
5353,T. INGELL.,
5354,T. INGELL.,On the following Monday I glanced at _The Cake_ at breakfast-time to
5355,T. INGELL.,"make sure, as usual, of her inferiority to my beloved but unremunerative"
5356,T. INGELL.,_Bun_. I opened on a heading: 'The Village that Voted the Earth was
5357,T. INGELL.,Flat.' I read ... I read that the Geoplanarian Society--a society
5358,T. INGELL.,devoted to the proposition that the earth is flat--had held its Annual
5359,T. INGELL.,"Banquet and Exercises at Huckley on Saturday, when after convincing"
5360,T. INGELL.,"addresses, amid scenes of the greatest enthusiasm, Huckley village had"
5361,T. INGELL.,decided by an unanimous vote of 438 that the earth was flat. I do not
5362,T. INGELL.,remember that I breathed again till I had finished the two columns of
5363,T. INGELL.,description that followed. Only one man could have written them. They
5364,T. INGELL.,"were flawless--crisp, nervous, austere yet human, poignant, vital,"
5365,T. INGELL.,arresting--most distinctly arresting--dynamic enough to shift a
5366,T. INGELL.,"city--and quotable by whole sticks at a time. And there was a leader, a"
5367,T. INGELL.,"grave and poised leader, which tore me in two with mirth, until I"
5368,T. INGELL.,remembered that I had been left out--infamously and unjustifiably
5369,T. INGELL.,"dropped. I went to Ollyett's rooms. He was breakfasting, and, to do him"
5370,T. INGELL.,"justice, looked conscience-stricken."
5371,T. INGELL.,
5372,T. INGELL.,"'It wasn't my fault,' he began. 'It was Bat Masquerier. I swear _I_"
5373,T. INGELL.,would have asked you to come if--'
5374,T. INGELL.,
5375,T. INGELL.,"'Never mind that,' I said. 'It's the best bit of work you've ever done"
5376,T. INGELL.,or will do. Did any of it happen?'
5377,T. INGELL.,
5378,T. INGELL.,'Happen? Heavens! D'you think even _I_ could have invented it?'
5379,T. INGELL.,
5380,T. INGELL.,'Is it exclusive to _The Cake_?' I cried.
5381,T. INGELL.,
5382,T. INGELL.,"'It cost Bat Masquerier two thousand,' Ollyett replied. 'D'you think"
5383,T. INGELL.,he'd let any one else in on that? But I give you my sacred word I knew
5384,T. INGELL.,nothing about it till he asked me to come down and cover it. He had
5385,T. INGELL.,"Huckley posted in three colours, ""The Geoplanarians' Annual Banquet and"
5386,T. INGELL.,"Exercises."" Yes, he invented ""Geoplanarians."" He wanted Huckley to think"
5387,T. INGELL.,"it meant aeroplanes. Yes, I know that there is a real Society that"
5388,T. INGELL.,thinks the world's flat--they ought to be grateful for the lift--but Bat
5389,T. INGELL.,"made his own. He did! He created the whole show, I tell you. He swept"
5390,T. INGELL.,out half his Halls for the job. Think of that--on a Saturday! They--we
5391,T. INGELL.,"went down in motor char-Ã -bancs--three of 'em--one pink, one primrose,"
5392,T. INGELL.,"and one forget-me-not blue--twenty people in each one and ""The Earth"
5393,T. INGELL.,"_is_ Flat"" on each side and across the back. I went with Teddy Rickets"
5394,T. INGELL.,"and Lafone from the Trefoil, and both the Silhouette Sisters, and--wait"
5395,T. INGELL.,a minute!--the Crossleigh Trio. You know the Every-Day Dramas Trio at
5396,T. INGELL.,"the Jocunda--Ada Crossleigh, ""Bunt"" Crossleigh, and little Victorine?"
5397,T. INGELL.,"Them. And there was Hoke Ramsden, the lightning-change chap in _Morgiana"
5398,T. INGELL.,"and Drexel_--and there was Billy Turpeen. Yes, you know him! The North"
5399,T. INGELL.,"London Star. ""I'm the Referee that got himself disliked at Blackheath."""
5400,T. INGELL.,_That_ chap! And there was Mackaye--that one-eyed Scotch fellow that all
5401,T. INGELL.,Glasgow is crazy about. Talk of subordinating yourself for Art's sake!
5402,T. INGELL.,Mackaye was the earnest inquirer who got converted at the end of the
5403,T. INGELL.,"meeting. And there was quite a lot of girls I didn't know, and--oh,"
5404,T. INGELL.,"yes--there was 'Dal! 'Dal Benzaguen herself! We sat together, going and"
5405,T. INGELL.,"coming. She's all the darling there ever was. She sent you her love, and"
5406,T. INGELL.,she told me to tell you that she won't forget about Nellie Farren. She
5407,T. INGELL.,"says you've given her an ideal to work for. She? Oh, she was the Lady"
5408,T. INGELL.,"Secretary to the Geoplanarians, of course. I forget who were in the"
5409,T. INGELL.,other brakes--provincial stars mostly--but they played up gorgeously.
5410,T. INGELL.,The art of the music-hall's changed since your day. They didn't overdo
5411,T. INGELL.,"it a bit. You see, people who believe the earth is flat don't dress"
5412,T. INGELL.,quite like other people. You may have noticed that I hinted at that in
5413,T. INGELL.,"my account. It's a rather flat-fronted Ionic style--neo-Victorian,"
5414,T. INGELL.,"except for the bustles, 'Dal told me,--but 'Dal looked heavenly in it!"
5415,T. INGELL.,So did little Victorine. And there was a girl in the blue brake--she's a
5416,T. INGELL.,provincial--but she's coming to town this winter and she'll knock
5417,T. INGELL.,'em--Winnie Deans. Remember that! She told Huckley how she had suffered
5418,T. INGELL.,for the Cause as a governess in a rich family where they believed that
5419,T. INGELL.,"the world is round, and how she threw up her job sooner than teach"
5420,T. INGELL.,immoral geography. That was at the overflow meeting outside the
5421,T. INGELL.,Baptist chapel. She knocked 'em to sawdust! We must look out for
5422,T. INGELL.,"Winnie.... But Lafone! Lafone was beyond everything. Impact,"
5423,T. INGELL.,personality--conviction--the whole bag o' tricks! He sweated conviction.
5424,T. INGELL.,"Gad, he convinced _me_ while he was speaking! (Him? He was President of"
5425,T. INGELL.,"the Geoplanarians, of course. Haven't you read my account?) It _is_ an"
5426,T. INGELL.,"infernally plausible theory. After all, no one has actually proved the"
5427,T. INGELL.,"earth is round, have they?'"
5428,T. INGELL.,
5429,T. INGELL.,'Never mind the earth. What about Huckley?'
5430,T. INGELL.,
5431,T. INGELL.,"'Oh, Huckley got tight. That's the worst of these model villages if you"
5432,T. INGELL.,let 'em smell fire-water. There's one alcoholic pub in the place that
5433,T. INGELL.,Sir Thomas can't get rid of. Bat made it his base. He sent down the
5434,T. INGELL.,banquet in two motor lorries--dinner for five hundred and drinks for ten
5435,T. INGELL.,thousand. Huckley voted all right. Don't you make any mistake about
5436,T. INGELL.,"that. No vote, no dinner. A unanimous vote--exactly as I've said. At"
5437,T. INGELL.,"least, the Rector and the Doctor were the only dissentients. We didn't"
5438,T. INGELL.,"count them. Oh yes, Sir Thomas was there. He came and grinned at us"
5439,T. INGELL.,through his park gates. He'll grin worse to-day. There's an aniline dye
5440,T. INGELL.,that you rub through a stencil-plate that eats about a foot into any
5441,T. INGELL.,stone and wears good to the last. Bat had both the lodge-gates
5442,T. INGELL.,"stencilled ""The Earth _is_ flat!"" and all the barns and walls they could"
5443,T. INGELL.,"get at.... Oh Lord, but Huckley was drunk! We had to fill 'em up to make"
5444,T. INGELL.,'em forgive us for not being aeroplanes. Unthankful yokels! D'you
5445,T. INGELL.,realise that Emperors couldn't have commanded the talent Bat decanted on
5446,T. INGELL.,"'em? Why, 'Dal alone was.... And by eight o'clock not even a bit of"
5447,T. INGELL.,"paper left! The whole show packed up and gone, and Huckley hoo-raying"
5448,T. INGELL.,for the earth being flat.'
5449,T. INGELL.,
5450,T. INGELL.,"'Very good,' I began. 'I am, as you know, a one-third proprietor of"
5451,T. INGELL.,_The Bun_.'
5452,T. INGELL.,
5453,T. INGELL.,"'I didn't forget that,' Ollyett interrupted. 'That was uppermost in my"
5454,T. INGELL.,mind all the time. I've got a special account for _The Bun_ to-day--it's
5455,T. INGELL.,"an idyll--and just to show how I thought of you, I told 'Dal, coming"
5456,T. INGELL.,"home, about your Gubby Dance, and she told Winnie. Winnie came back in"
5457,T. INGELL.,our char-Ã -banc. After a bit we had to get out and dance it in a field.
5458,T. INGELL.,It's quite a dance the way we did it--and Lafone invented a sort of
5459,T. INGELL.,gorilla lockstep procession at the end. Bat had sent down a film-chap on
5460,T. INGELL.,the chance of getting something. He was the son of a clergyman--a most
5461,T. INGELL.,dynamic personality. He said there isn't anything for the cinema in
5462,T. INGELL.,meetings _qua_ meetings--they lack action. Films are a branch of art by
5463,T. INGELL.,themselves. But he went wild over the Gubby. He said it was like Peter's
5464,T. INGELL.,vision at Joppa. He took about a million feet of it. Then I photoed it
5465,T. INGELL.,"exclusive for _The Bun_. I've sent 'em in already, only remember we must"
5466,T. INGELL.,eliminate Winnie's left leg in the first figure. It's too arresting....
5467,T. INGELL.,And there you are! But I tell you I'm afraid of Bat. That man's the
5468,T. INGELL.,Personal Devil. He did it all. He didn't even come down himself. He said
5469,T. INGELL.,he'd distract his people.'
5470,T. INGELL.,
5471,T. INGELL.,'Why didn't he ask me to come?' I persisted.
5472,T. INGELL.,
5473,T. INGELL.,'Because he said you'd distract me. He said he wanted my brains on ice.
5474,T. INGELL.,He got 'em. I believe it's the best thing I've ever done.' He reached
5475,T. INGELL.,"for _The Cake_ and re-read it luxuriously. 'Yes, out and away the"
5476,T. INGELL.,"best--supremely quotable,' he concluded, and--after another survey--'By"
5477,T. INGELL.,"God, what a genius I was yesterday!'"
5478,T. INGELL.,
5479,T. INGELL.,"I would have been angry, but I had not the time. That morning, Press"
5480,T. INGELL.,agencies grovelled to me in _The Bun_ office for leave to use certain
5481,T. INGELL.,"photos, which, they understood, I controlled, of a certain village"
5482,T. INGELL.,"dance. When I had sent the fifth man away on the edge of tears, my"
5483,T. INGELL.,self-respect came back a little. Then there was _The Bun's_ poster to
5484,T. INGELL.,"get out. Art being elimination, I fined it down to two words (one too"
5485,T. INGELL.,"many, as it proved)--'The Gubby!' in red, at which our manager"
5486,T. INGELL.,protested; but by five o'clock he told me that I was _the_ Napoleon of
5487,T. INGELL.,Fleet Street. Ollyett's account in _The Bun_ of the Geoplanarians'
5488,T. INGELL.,Exercises and Love Feast lacked the supreme shock of his version in _The
5489,T. INGELL.,"Cake_, but it bruised more; while the photos of 'The Gubby' (which, with"
5490,T. INGELL.,"Winnie's left leg, was why I had set the doubtful press to work so"
5491,T. INGELL.,"early) were beyond praise and, next day, beyond price. But even then I"
5492,T. INGELL.,did not understand.
5493,T. INGELL.,
5494,T. INGELL.,"A week later, I think it was, Bat Masquerier telephoned to me to come to"
5495,T. INGELL.,the Trefoil.
5496,T. INGELL.,
5497,T. INGELL.,"'It's your turn now,' he said. 'I'm not asking Ollyett. Come to the"
5498,T. INGELL.,stage-box.'
5499,T. INGELL.,
5500,T. INGELL.,"I went, and, as Bat's guest, was received as Royalty is not. We sat well"
5501,T. INGELL.,back and looked out on the packed thousands. It was _Morgiana and
5502,T. INGELL.,"Drexel_, that fluid and electric review which Bat--though he gave Lafone"
5503,T. INGELL.,the credit--really created.
5504,T. INGELL.,
5505,T. INGELL.,"'Ye-es,' said Bat dreamily, after Morgiana had given 'the nasty jar' to"
5506,T. INGELL.,"the Forty Thieves in their forty oil 'combinations.' 'As you say, I've"
5507,T. INGELL.,got 'em and I can hold 'em. What a man does doesn't matter much; and how
5508,T. INGELL.,he does it don't matter either. It's the _when_--the psychological
5509,T. INGELL.,moment. 'Press can't make up for it; money can't; brains can't. A lot's
5510,T. INGELL.,"luck, but all the rest is genius. I'm not speaking about My people now."
5511,T. INGELL.,I'm talking of Myself.'
5512,T. INGELL.,
5513,T. INGELL.,Then 'Dal--she was the only one who dared--knocked at the door and stood
5514,T. INGELL.,behind us all alive and panting as Morgiana. Lafone was carrying the
5515,T. INGELL.,"police-court scene, and the house was ripped up crossways with laughter."
5516,T. INGELL.,
5517,T. INGELL.,"'Ah! Tell a fellow now,' she asked me for the twentieth time, 'did you"
5518,T. INGELL.,love Nellie Farren when you were young?'
5519,T. INGELL.,
5520,T. INGELL.,"'Did we love her?' I answered. '""If the earth and the sky and the"
5521,T. INGELL.,"sea""--There were three million of us, 'Dal, and we worshipped her.'"
5522,T. INGELL.,
5523,T. INGELL.,'How did she get it across?' Dal went on.
5524,T. INGELL.,
5525,T. INGELL.,'She was Nellie. The houses used to coo over her when she came on.'
5526,T. INGELL.,
5527,T. INGELL.,"'I've had a good deal, but I've never been cooed over yet,' said 'Dal"
5528,T. INGELL.,wistfully.
5529,T. INGELL.,
5530,T. INGELL.,"'It isn't the how, it's the when,' Bat repeated. 'Ah!'"
5531,T. INGELL.,
5532,T. INGELL.,He leaned forward as the house began to rock and peal full-throatedly.
5533,T. INGELL.,'Dal fled. A sinuous and silent procession was filing into the
5534,T. INGELL.,police-court to a scarcely audible accompaniment. It was dressed--but
5535,T. INGELL.,the world and all its picture-palaces know how it was dressed. It
5536,T. INGELL.,"danced and it danced, and it danced the dance which bit all humanity in"
5537,T. INGELL.,"the leg for half a year, and it wound up with the lockstep finale that"
5538,T. INGELL.,"mowed the house down in swathes, sobbing and aching. Somebody in the"
5539,T. INGELL.,"gallery moaned, 'Oh Gord, the Gubby!' and we heard the word run like a"
5540,T. INGELL.,"shudder, for they had not a full breath left among them. Then 'Dal came"
5541,T. INGELL.,"on, an electric star in her dark hair, the diamonds flashing in her"
5542,T. INGELL.,three-inch heels--a vision that made no sign for thirty counted seconds
5543,T. INGELL.,while the police-court scene dissolved behind her into Morgiana's
5544,T. INGELL.,"Manicure Palace, and they recovered themselves. The star on her forehead"
5545,T. INGELL.,"went out, and a soft light bathed her as she took--slowly, slowly to the"
5546,T. INGELL.,croon of adoring strings--the eighteen paces forward. We saw her first
5547,T. INGELL.,as a queen alone; next as a queen for the first time conscious of her
5548,T. INGELL.,"subjects, and at the end, when her hands fluttered, as a woman"
5549,T. INGELL.,"delighted, awed not a little, but transfigured and illuminated with"
5550,T. INGELL.,"sheer, compelling affection and goodwill. I caught the broken mutter of"
5551,T. INGELL.,welcome--the coo which is more than tornadoes of applause. It died and
5552,T. INGELL.,rose and died again lovingly.
5553,T. INGELL.,
5554,T. INGELL.,"'She's got it across,' Bat whispered. 'I've never seen her like this. I"
5555,T. INGELL.,"told her to light up the star, but I was wrong, and she knew it. She's"
5556,T. INGELL.,an artist.'
5557,T. INGELL.,
5558,T. INGELL.,"''Dal, you darling!' some one spoke, not loudly but it carried through"
5559,T. INGELL.,the house.
5560,T. INGELL.,
5561,T. INGELL.,"'Thank _you_!' 'Dal answered, and in that broken tone one heard the last"
5562,T. INGELL.,"fetter riveted. 'Good evening, boys! I've just come from--now--where the"
5563,T. INGELL.,dooce was it I have come from?' She turned to the impassive files of
5564,T. INGELL.,"the Gubby dancers, and went on: 'Ah, so good of you to remind me, you"
5565,T. INGELL.,"dear, bun-faced things. I've just come from the village--The Village"
5566,T. INGELL.,that Voted the Earth was Flat.'
5567,T. INGELL.,
5568,T. INGELL.,She swept into that song with the full orchestra. It devastated the
5569,T. INGELL.,"habitable earth for the next six months. Imagine, then, what its rage"
5570,T. INGELL.,and pulse must have been at the incandescent hour of its birth! She only
5571,T. INGELL.,"gave the chorus once. At the end of the second verse, 'Are you _with_"
5572,T. INGELL.,"me, boys?' she cried, and the house tore it clean away from"
5573,T. INGELL.,her--'_Earth_ was flat--_Earth_ was flat. Flat as my hat--Flatter than
5574,T. INGELL.,that'--drowning all but the bassoons and double-basses that marked
5575,T. INGELL.,the word.
5576,T. INGELL.,
5577,T. INGELL.,"'Wonderful,' I said to Bat. 'And it's only ""Nuts in May,"" with"
5578,T. INGELL.,variations.'
5579,T. INGELL.,
5580,T. INGELL.,"'Yes--but _I_ did the variations,' he replied."
5581,T. INGELL.,
5582,T. INGELL.,"At the last verse she gestured to Carlini the conductor, who threw her"
5583,T. INGELL.,up his baton. She caught it with a boy's ease. 'Are you _with_ me?' she
5584,T. INGELL.,"cried once more, and--the maddened house behind her--abolished all the"
5585,T. INGELL.,instruments except the guttural belch of the double-basses on
5586,T. INGELL.,'_Earth_'--'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat--_Earth_ was
5587,T. INGELL.,flat!' It was delirium. Then she picked up the Gubby dancers and led
5588,T. INGELL.,them in a clattering improvised lockstep thrice round the stage till her
5589,T. INGELL.,last kick sent her diamond-hiked shoe catherine-wheeling to the
5590,T. INGELL.,electrolier.
5591,T. INGELL.,
5592,T. INGELL.,"I saw the forest of hands raised to catch it, heard the roaring and"
5593,T. INGELL.,"stamping pass through hurricanes to full typhoon; heard the song, pinned"
5594,T. INGELL.,down by the faithful double-basses as the bull-dog pins down the
5595,T. INGELL.,"bellowing bull, overbear even those; till at last the curtain fell and"
5596,T. INGELL.,"Bat took me round to her dressing-room, where she lay spent after her"
5597,T. INGELL.,"seventh call. Still the song, through all those white-washed walls,"
5598,T. INGELL.,shook the reinforced concrete of the Trefoil as steam pile-drivers shake
5599,T. INGELL.,the flanks of a dock.
5600,T. INGELL.,
5601,T. INGELL.,"'I'm all out--first time in my life. Ah! Tell a fellow now, did I get it"
5602,T. INGELL.,across?' she whispered huskily.
5603,T. INGELL.,
5604,T. INGELL.,"'You know you did,' I replied as she dipped her nose deep in a beaker of"
5605,T. INGELL.,barley-water. 'They cooed over you.'
5606,T. INGELL.,
5607,T. INGELL.,"Bat nodded. 'And poor Nellie's dead--in Africa, ain't it?'"
5608,T. INGELL.,
5609,T. INGELL.,"'I hope I'll die before they stop cooing,' said 'Dal."
5610,T. INGELL.,
5611,T. INGELL.,"'""_Earth_ was flat--_Earth_ was flat!""' Now it was more like mine-pumps"
5612,T. INGELL.,in flood.
5613,T. INGELL.,
5614,T. INGELL.,"'They'll have the house down if you don't take another,' some one"
5615,T. INGELL.,called.
5616,T. INGELL.,
5617,T. INGELL.,"'Bless 'em!' said 'Dal, and went out for her eighth, when in the face of"
5618,T. INGELL.,"that cataract she said yawning, 'I don't know how _you_ feel, children,"
5619,T. INGELL.,but _I_'m dead. You be quiet.'
5620,T. INGELL.,
5621,T. INGELL.,"'Hold a minute,' said Bat to me. 'I've got to hear how it went in the"
5622,T. INGELL.,"provinces. Winnie Deans had it in Manchester, and Ramsden at"
5623,T. INGELL.,Glasgow--and there are all the films too. I had rather a heavy
5624,T. INGELL.,week-end.'
5625,T. INGELL.,
5626,T. INGELL.,The telephones presently reassured him.
5627,T. INGELL.,
5628,T. INGELL.,"'It'll do,' said he. 'And _he_ said my home address was Jerusalem.' He"
5629,T. INGELL.,left me humming the refrain of 'The Holy City.' Like Ollyett I found
5630,T. INGELL.,myself afraid of that man.
5631,T. INGELL.,
5632,T. INGELL.,When I got out into the street and met the disgorging picture-palaces
5633,T. INGELL.,capering on the pavements and humming it (for he had put the gramophones
5634,T. INGELL.,"on with the films), and when I saw far to the south the red electrics"
5635,T. INGELL.,"flash 'Gubby' across the Thames, I feared more than ever."
5636,T. INGELL.,
5637,T. INGELL.,*       *       *       *       *
5638,T. INGELL.,
5639,T. INGELL.,"A few days passed which were like nothing except, perhaps, a suspense of"
5640,T. INGELL.,fever in which the sick man perceives the searchlights of the world's
5641,T. INGELL.,assembled navies in act to converge on one minute fragment of
5642,T. INGELL.,wreckage--one only in all the black and agony-strewn sea. Then those
5643,T. INGELL.,beams focussed themselves. Earth as we knew it--the full circuit of our
5644,T. INGELL.,orb--laid the weight of its impersonal and searing curiosity on this
5645,T. INGELL.,Huckley which had voted that it was flat. It asked for news about
5646,T. INGELL.,"Huckley--where and what it might be, and how it talked--it knew how it"
5647,T. INGELL.,"danced--and how it thought in its wonderful soul. And then, in all the"
5648,T. INGELL.,"zealous, merciless press, Huckley was laid out for it to look at, as a"
5649,T. INGELL.,drop of pond water is exposed on the sheet of a magic-lantern show. But
5650,T. INGELL.,Huckley's sheet was only coterminous with the use of type among mankind.
5651,T. INGELL.,"For the precise moment that was necessary, Fate ruled it that there"
5652,T. INGELL.,should be nothing of first importance in the world's idle eye. One
5653,T. INGELL.,"atrocious murder, a political crisis, an incautious or heady"
5654,T. INGELL.,"continental statesman, the mere catarrh of a king, would have wiped out"
5655,T. INGELL.,"the significance of our message, as a passing cloud annuls the urgent"
5656,T. INGELL.,helio. But it was halcyon weather in every respect. Ollyett and I did
5657,T. INGELL.,not need to lift our little fingers any more than the Alpine climber
5658,T. INGELL.,whose last sentence has unkeyed the arch of the avalanche. The thing
5659,T. INGELL.,roared and pulverised and swept beyond eyesight all by itself--all by
5660,T. INGELL.,"itself. And once well away, the fall of kingdoms could not have"
5661,T. INGELL.,diverted it.
5662,T. INGELL.,
5663,T. INGELL.,"Ours is, after all, a kindly earth. While The Song ran and raped it with"
5664,T. INGELL.,"the cataleptic kick of 'Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,' multiplied by the West"
5665,T. INGELL.,"African significance of 'Everybody's doing it,' plus twice the infernal"
5666,T. INGELL.,elementality of a certain tune in _Dona et Gamma_; when for all
5667,T. INGELL.,"practical purposes, literary, dramatic, artistic, social, municipal,"
5668,T. INGELL.,"political, commercial, and administrative, the Earth _was_ flat, the"
5669,T. INGELL.,Rector of Huckley wrote to us--again as a lover of accuracy--to point
5670,T. INGELL.,out that the Huckley vote on 'the alleged flatness of this scene of our
5671,T. INGELL.,labours here below' was _not_ unanimous; he and the doctor having voted
5672,T. INGELL.,against it. And the great Baron Reuter himself (I am sure it could have
5673,T. INGELL.,"been none other) flashed that letter in full to the front, back, and"
5674,T. INGELL.,both wings of this scene of our labours. For Huckley was News. _The Bun_
5675,T. INGELL.,also contributed a photograph which cost me some trouble to fake.
5676,T. INGELL.,
5677,T. INGELL.,"'We are a vital nation,' said Ollyett while we were discussing affairs"
5678,T. INGELL.,at a Bat dinner. 'Only an Englishman could have written that letter at
5679,T. INGELL.,this present juncture.'
5680,T. INGELL.,
5681,T. INGELL.,'It reminded me of a tourist in the Cave of the Winds under Niagara.
5682,T. INGELL.,Just one figure in a mackintosh. But perhaps you saw our photo?' I
5683,T. INGELL.,said proudly.
5684,T. INGELL.,
5685,T. INGELL.,"'Yes,' Bat replied. 'I've been to Niagara, too. And how's Huckley taking"
5686,T. INGELL.,it?'
5687,T. INGELL.,
5688,T. INGELL.,"'They don't quite understand, of course,' said Ollyett. 'But it's"
5689,T. INGELL.,bringing pots of money into the place. Ever since the motor-bus
5690,T. INGELL.,excursions were started--'
5691,T. INGELL.,
5692,T. INGELL.,"'I didn't know they had been,' said Pallant."
5693,T. INGELL.,
5694,T. INGELL.,'Oh yes. Motor char-Ã -bancs--uniformed guides and key-bugles included.
5695,T. INGELL.,"They're getting a bit fed up with the tune there nowadays,'"
5696,T. INGELL.,Ollyett added.
5697,T. INGELL.,
5698,T. INGELL.,"'They play it under his windows, don't they?' Bat asked. 'He can't stop"
5699,T. INGELL.,the right of way across his park.'
5700,T. INGELL.,
5701,T. INGELL.,"'He cannot,' Ollyett answered. 'By the way, Woodhouse, I've bought that"
5702,T. INGELL.,font for you from the sexton. I paid fifteen pounds for it.'
5703,T. INGELL.,
5704,T. INGELL.,'What am I supposed to do with it?' asked Woodhouse.
5705,T. INGELL.,
5706,T. INGELL.,'You give it to the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is fourteenth-century
5707,T. INGELL.,work all right. You can trust me.'
5708,T. INGELL.,
5709,T. INGELL.,"'Is it worth it--now?' said Pallant. 'Not that I'm weakening, but merely"
5710,T. INGELL.,as a matter of tactics?'
5711,T. INGELL.,
5712,T. INGELL.,"'But this is true,' said Ollyett. 'Besides, it is my hobby, I always"
5713,T. INGELL.,wanted to be an architect. I'll attend to it myself. It's too serious
5714,T. INGELL.,for _The Bun_ and miles too good for _The Cake_.'
5715,T. INGELL.,
5716,T. INGELL.,"He broke ground in a ponderous architectural weekly, which had never"
5717,T. INGELL.,"heard of Huckley. There was no passion in his statement, but mere fact"
5718,T. INGELL.,backed by a wide range of authorities. He established beyond doubt that
5719,T. INGELL.,"the old font at Huckley had been thrown out, on Sir Thomas's"
5720,T. INGELL.,"instigation, twenty years ago, to make room for a new one of Bath stone"
5721,T. INGELL.,adorned with Limoges enamels; and that it had lain ever since in a
5722,T. INGELL.,"corner of the sexton's shed. He proved, with learned men to support him,"
5723,T. INGELL.,that there was only one other font in all England to compare with it. So
5724,T. INGELL.,Woodhouse bought it and presented it to a grateful South Kensington
5725,T. INGELL.,which said it would see the earth still flatter before it returned the
5726,T. INGELL.,treasure to purblind Huckley. Bishops by the benchful and most of the
5727,T. INGELL.,"Royal Academy, not to mention 'Margaritas ante Porcos,' wrote fervently"
5728,T. INGELL.,to the papers. _Punch_ based a political cartoon on it; the _Times_ a
5729,T. INGELL.,"third leader, 'The Lust of Newness'; and the _Spectator_ a scholarly and"
5730,T. INGELL.,"delightful middle, 'Village Hausmania.' The vast amused outside world"
5731,T. INGELL.,said in all its tongues and types: 'Of course! This is just what Huckley
5732,T. INGELL.,would do!' And neither Sir Thomas nor the Rector nor the sexton nor any
5733,T. INGELL.,one else wrote to deny it.
5734,T. INGELL.,
5735,T. INGELL.,"'You see,' said Ollyett, 'this is much more of a blow to Huckley than it"
5736,T. INGELL.,looks--because every word of it's true. Your Gubby dance was
5737,T. INGELL.,"inspiration, I admit, but it hadn't its roots in--'"
5738,T. INGELL.,
5739,T. INGELL.,"'Two hemispheres and four continents so far,' I pointed out."
5740,T. INGELL.,
5741,T. INGELL.,'Its roots in the hearts of Huckley was what I was going to say. Why
5742,T. INGELL.,don't you ever come down and look at the place? You've never seen it
5743,T. INGELL.,since we were stopped there.'
5744,T. INGELL.,
5745,T. INGELL.,"'I've only my week-ends free,' I said, 'and you seem to spend yours"
5746,T. INGELL.,there pretty regularly--with the side-car. I was afraid--'
5747,T. INGELL.,
5748,T. INGELL.,"'Oh, _that's_ all right,' he said cheerily. 'We're quite an old engaged"
5749,T. INGELL.,"couple now. As a matter of fact, it happened after ""the gravid polled"
5750,T. INGELL.,"Angus"" business. Come along this Saturday. Woodhouse says he'll run us"
5751,T. INGELL.,down after lunch. He wants to see Huckley too.'
5752,T. INGELL.,
5753,T. INGELL.,"Pallant could not accompany us, but Bat took his place."
5754,T. INGELL.,
5755,T. INGELL.,"'It's odd,' said Bat, 'that none of us except Ollyett has ever set eyes"
5756,T. INGELL.,on Huckley since that time. That's what I always tell My people. Local
5757,T. INGELL.,"colour is all right after you've got your idea. Before that, it's a mere"
5758,T. INGELL.,nuisance.' He regaled us on the way down with panoramic views of the
5759,T. INGELL.,success--geographical and financial--of 'The Gubby' and The Song.
5760,T. INGELL.,
5761,T. INGELL.,"'By the way,' said he, 'I've assigned 'Dal all the gramophone rights of"
5762,T. INGELL.,"""The Earth."" She's a born artist. 'Hadn't sense enough to hit me for"
5763,T. INGELL.,triple-dubs the morning after. She'd have taken it out in coos.'
5764,T. INGELL.,
5765,T. INGELL.,'Bless her! And what'll she make out of the gramophone rights?' I asked.
5766,T. INGELL.,
5767,T. INGELL.,'Lord knows!' he replied. 'I've made fifty-four thousand my little end
5768,T. INGELL.,"of the business, and it's only just beginning. Hear _that_!'"
5769,T. INGELL.,
5770,T. INGELL.,A shell-pink motor-brake roared up behind us to the music on a key-bugle
5771,T. INGELL.,of 'The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat.' In a few minutes we
5772,T. INGELL.,"overtook another, in natural wood, whose occupants were singing it"
5773,T. INGELL.,through their noses.
5774,T. INGELL.,
5775,T. INGELL.,"'I don't know that agency. It must be Cook's,' said Ollyett. 'They _do_"
5776,T. INGELL.,suffer.' We were never out of earshot of the tune the rest of the way
5777,T. INGELL.,to Huckley.
5778,T. INGELL.,
5779,T. INGELL.,"Though I knew it would be so, I was disappointed with the actual aspect"
5780,T. INGELL.,of the spot we had--it is not too much to say--created in the face of
5781,T. INGELL.,the nations. The alcoholic pub; the village green; the Baptist chapel;
5782,T. INGELL.,the church; the sexton's shed; the Rectory whence the so-wonderful
5783,T. INGELL.,letters had come; Sir Thomas's park gate-pillars still violently
5784,T. INGELL.,"declaring 'The Earth _is_ flat,' were as mean, as average, as ordinary"
5785,T. INGELL.,"as the photograph of a room where a murder has been committed. Ollyett,"
5786,T. INGELL.,"who, of course, knew the place specially well, made the most of it to"
5787,T. INGELL.,"us. Bat, who had employed it as a back-cloth to one of his own dramas,"
5788,T. INGELL.,"dismissed it as a thing used and emptied, but Woodhouse expressed my"
5789,T. INGELL.,feelings when he said: 'Is that all--after all we've done?'
5790,T. INGELL.,
5791,T. INGELL.,"'_I_ know,' said Ollyett soothingly. '""Like that strange song I heard"
5792,T. INGELL.,"Apollo sing: When Ilion like a mist rose into towers."" I've felt the"
5793,T. INGELL.,"same sometimes, though it has been Paradise for me. But they"
5794,T. INGELL.,_do_ suffer.'
5795,T. INGELL.,
5796,T. INGELL.,The fourth brake in thirty minutes had just turned into Sir Thomas's
5797,T. INGELL.,park to tell the Hall that 'The _Earth_ was flat'; a knot of obviously
5798,T. INGELL.,American tourists were kodaking his lodge-gates; while the tea-shop
5799,T. INGELL.,opposite the lych-gate was full of people buying postcards of the old
5800,T. INGELL.,font as it had lain twenty years in the sexton's shed. We went to the
5801,T. INGELL.,alcoholic pub and congratulated the proprietor.
5802,T. INGELL.,
5803,T. INGELL.,"'It's bringin' money to the place,' said he. 'But in a sense you can buy"
5804,T. INGELL.,money too dear. It isn't doin' us any good. People are laughin' at us.
5805,T. INGELL.,"That's what they're doin'.... Now, with regard to that Vote of ours you"
5806,T. INGELL.,may have heard talk about....'
5807,T. INGELL.,
5808,T. INGELL.,"'For Gorze sake, chuck that votin' business,' cried an elderly man at"
5809,T. INGELL.,"the door. 'Money-gettin' or no money-gettin', we're fed up with it.'"
5810,T. INGELL.,
5811,T. INGELL.,"'Well, I do think,' said the publican, shifting his ground, 'I do think"
5812,T. INGELL.,Sir Thomas might ha' managed better in some things.'
5813,T. INGELL.,
5814,T. INGELL.,"'He tole me,'--the elderly man shouldered his way to the bar--'he tole"
5815,T. INGELL.,me twenty years ago to take an' lay that font in my tool-shed. He _tole_
5816,T. INGELL.,"me so himself. An' now, after twenty years, me own wife makin' me out"
5817,T. INGELL.,little better than the common 'angman!'
5818,T. INGELL.,
5819,T. INGELL.,"'That's the sexton,' the publican explained. 'His good lady sells the"
5820,T. INGELL.,postcards--if you 'aven't got some. But we feel Sir Thomas might ha'
5821,T. INGELL.,done better.'
5822,T. INGELL.,
5823,T. INGELL.,'What's he got to do with it?' said Woodhouse.
5824,T. INGELL.,
5825,T. INGELL.,"'There's nothin' we can trace 'ome to 'im in so many words, but we think"
5826,T. INGELL.,"he might 'ave saved us the font business. Now, in regard to that votin'"
5827,T. INGELL.,business--'
5828,T. INGELL.,
5829,T. INGELL.,"'Chuck it! Oh, chuck it!' the sexton roared, 'or you'll 'ave me cuttin'"
5830,T. INGELL.,my throat at cock-crow. 'Ere's another parcel of fun-makers!'
5831,T. INGELL.,
5832,T. INGELL.,A motor-brake had pulled up at the door and a multitude of men and
5833,T. INGELL.,women immediately descended. We went out to look. They bore rolled
5834,T. INGELL.,"banners, a reading-desk in three pieces, and, I specially noticed, a"
5835,T. INGELL.,"collapsible harmonium, such as is used on ships at sea."
5836,T. INGELL.,
5837,T. INGELL.,"'Salvation Army?' I said, though I saw no uniforms."
5838,T. INGELL.,
5839,T. INGELL.,Two of them unfurled a banner between poles which bore the legend: 'The
5840,T. INGELL.,"Earth _is_ flat.' Woodhouse and I turned to Bat. He shook his head. 'No,"
5841,T. INGELL.,no! Not me.... If I had only seen their costumes in advance!'
5842,T. INGELL.,
5843,T. INGELL.,'Good Lord!' said Ollyett. 'It's the genuine Society!'
5844,T. INGELL.,
5845,T. INGELL.,The company advanced on the green with the precision of people well
5846,T. INGELL.,broke to these movements. Scene-shifters could not have been quicker
5847,T. INGELL.,"with the three-piece rostrum, nor stewards with the harmonium. Almost"
5848,T. INGELL.,"before its cross-legs had been kicked into their catches, certainly"
5849,T. INGELL.,"before the tourists by the lodge-gates had begun to move over, a woman"
5850,T. INGELL.,sat down to it and struck up a hymn:
5851,T. INGELL.,
5852,T. INGELL.,"Hear ther truth our tongues are telling,"
5853,T. INGELL.,"Spread ther light from shore to shore,"
5854,T. INGELL.,God hath given man a dwelling
5855,T. INGELL.,Flat and flat for evermore.
5856,T. INGELL.,
5857,T. INGELL.,"When ther Primal Dark retreated,"
5858,T. INGELL.,"When ther deeps were undesigned,"
5859,T. INGELL.,He with rule and level meted
5860,T. INGELL.,Habitation for mankind!
5861,T. INGELL.,
5862,T. INGELL.,"I saw sick envy on Bat's face. 'Curse Nature,' he muttered. 'She gets"
5863,T. INGELL.,ahead of you every time. To think _I_ forgot hymns and a harmonium!'
5864,T. INGELL.,
5865,T. INGELL.,Then came the chorus:
5866,T. INGELL.,
5867,T. INGELL.,"Hear ther truth our tongues are telling,"
5868,T. INGELL.,Spread ther light from shore to shore--
5869,T. INGELL.,"Oh, be faithful! Oh, be truthful!"
5870,T. INGELL.,Earth is flat for evermore.
5871,T. INGELL.,
5872,T. INGELL.,They sang several verses with the fervour of Christians awaiting their
5873,T. INGELL.,"lions. Then there were growlings in the air. The sexton, embraced by the"
5874,T. INGELL.,"landlord, two-stepped out of the pub-door. Each was trying to outroar"
5875,T. INGELL.,"the other. 'Apologising in advarnce for what he says,' the landlord"
5876,T. INGELL.,shouted: 'You'd better go away' (here the sexton began to speak words).
5877,T. INGELL.,'This isn't the time nor yet the place for--for any more o' this chat.'
5878,T. INGELL.,
5879,T. INGELL.,The crowd thickened. I saw the village police-sergeant come out of his
5880,T. INGELL.,cottage buckling his belt.
5881,T. INGELL.,
5882,T. INGELL.,"'But surely,' said the woman at the harmonium, 'there must be some"
5883,T. INGELL.,mistake. We are not suffragettes.'
5884,T. INGELL.,
5885,T. INGELL.,"'Damn it! They'd be a change,' cried the sexton. 'You get out of this!"
5886,T. INGELL.,"Don't talk! _I_ can't stand it for one! Get right out, or we'll"
5887,T. INGELL.,font you!'
5888,T. INGELL.,
5889,T. INGELL.,The crowd which was being recruited from every house in sight echoed the
5890,T. INGELL.,invitation. The sergeant pushed forward. A man beside the reading-desk
5891,T. INGELL.,said: 'But surely we are among dear friends and sympathisers. Listen to
5892,T. INGELL.,me for a moment.'
5893,T. INGELL.,
5894,T. INGELL.,It was the moment that a passing char-Ã -banc chose to strike into The
5895,T. INGELL.,"Song. The effect was instantaneous. Bat, Ollyett, and I, who by divers"
5896,T. INGELL.,"roads have learned the psychology of crowds, retreated towards the"
5897,T. INGELL.,"tavern door. Woodhouse, the newspaper proprietor, anxious, I presume, to"
5898,T. INGELL.,"keep touch with the public, dived into the thick of it. Every one else"
5899,T. INGELL.,told the Society to go away at once. When the lady at the harmonium (I
5900,T. INGELL.,began to understand why it is sometimes necessary to kill women) pointed
5901,T. INGELL.,at the stencilled park pillars and called them 'the cromlechs of our
5902,T. INGELL.,"common faith,' there was a snarl and a rush. The police-sergeant checked"
5903,T. INGELL.,"it, but advised the Society to keep on going. The Society withdrew into"
5904,T. INGELL.,"the brake fighting, as it were, a rear-guard action of oratory up each"
5905,T. INGELL.,"step. The collapsed harmonium was hauled in last, and with the perfect"
5906,T. INGELL.,"unreason of crowds, they cheered it loudly, till the chauffeur slipped"
5907,T. INGELL.,"in his clutch and sped away. Then the crowd broke up, congratulating all"
5908,T. INGELL.,"concerned except the sexton, who was held to have disgraced his office"
5909,T. INGELL.,by having sworn at ladies. We strolled across the green towards
5910,T. INGELL.,"Woodhouse, who was talking to the police-sergeant near the park-gates."
5911,T. INGELL.,We were not twenty yards from him when we saw Sir Thomas Ingell emerge
5912,T. INGELL.,"from the lodge and rush furiously at Woodhouse with an uplifted stick,"
5913,T. INGELL.,"at the same time shrieking: 'I'll teach you to laugh, you--' but Ollyett"
5914,T. INGELL.,"has the record of the language. By the time we reached them, Sir Thomas"
5915,T. INGELL.,"was on the ground; Woodhouse, very white, held the walking-stick and was"
5916,T. INGELL.,saying to the sergeant:
5917,T. INGELL.,
5918,T. INGELL.,'I give this person in charge for assault.'
5919,T. INGELL.,
5920,T. INGELL.,"'But, good Lord!' said the sergeant, whiter than Woodhouse. 'It's Sir"
5921,T. INGELL.,Thomas.'
5922,T. INGELL.,
5923,T. INGELL.,"'Whoever it is, it isn't fit to be at large,' said Woodhouse. The crowd"
5924,T. INGELL.,"suspecting something wrong began to reassemble, and all the English"
5925,T. INGELL.,"horror of a row in public moved us, headed by the sergeant, inside the"
5926,T. INGELL.,lodge. We shut both park-gates and lodge-door.
5927,T. INGELL.,
5928,T. INGELL.,"'You saw the assault, sergeant,' Woodhouse went on. 'You can testify I"
5929,T. INGELL.,used no more force than was necessary to protect myself. You can testify
5930,T. INGELL.,that I have not even damaged this person's property. (Here! take your
5931,T. INGELL.,"stick, you!) You heard the filthy language he used.'"
5932,T. INGELL.,
5933,T. INGELL.,"'I--I can't say I did,' the sergeant stammered."
5934,T. INGELL.,
5935,T. INGELL.,"'Oh, but _we_ did!' said Ollyett, and repeated it, to the apron-veiled"
5936,T. INGELL.,horror of the lodge-keeper's wife.
5937,T. INGELL.,
5938,T. INGELL.,Sir Thomas on a hard kitchen chair began to talk. He said he had 'stood
5939,T. INGELL.,"enough of being photographed like a wild beast,' and expressed loud"
5940,T. INGELL.,"regret that he had not killed 'that man,' who was 'conspiring with the"
5941,T. INGELL.,sergeant to laugh at him.'
5942,T. INGELL.,
5943,T. INGELL.,"''Ad you ever seen 'im before, Sir Thomas?' the sergeant asked."
5944,T. INGELL.,
5945,T. INGELL.,'No! But it's time an example was made here. I've never seen the sweep
5946,T. INGELL.,in my life.'
5947,T. INGELL.,
5948,T. INGELL.,I think it was Bat Masquerier's magnetic eye that recalled the past to
5949,T. INGELL.,"him, for his face changed and his jaw dropped. 'But I have!' he groaned."
5950,T. INGELL.,'I remember now.'
5951,T. INGELL.,
5952,T. INGELL.,"Here a writhing man entered by the back door. He was, he said, the"
5953,T. INGELL.,"village solicitor. I do not assert that he licked Woodhouse's boots, but"
5954,T. INGELL.,we should have respected him more if he had and been done with it. His
5955,T. INGELL.,"notion was that the matter could be accommodated, arranged and"
5956,T. INGELL.,"compromised for gold, and yet more gold. The sergeant thought so too."
5957,T. INGELL.,"Woodhouse undeceived them both. To the sergeant he said, 'Will you or"
5958,T. INGELL.,will you not enter the charge?' To the village solicitor he gave the
5959,T. INGELL.,"name of his lawyers, at which the man wrung his hands and cried, 'Oh,"
5960,T. INGELL.,"Sir T., Sir T.!' in a miserable falsetto, for it was a Bat Masquerier of"
5961,T. INGELL.,a firm. They conferred together in tragic whispers.
5962,T. INGELL.,
5963,T. INGELL.,"'I don't dive after Dickens,' said Ollyett to Bat and me by the window,"
5964,T. INGELL.,'but every time _I_ get into a row I notice the police-court always
5965,T. INGELL.,fills up with his characters.'
5966,T. INGELL.,
5967,T. INGELL.,"'I've noticed that too,' said Bat. 'But the odd thing is you mustn't"
5968,T. INGELL.,give the public straight Dickens--not in My business. I wonder why
5969,T. INGELL.,that is.'
5970,T. INGELL.,
5971,T. INGELL.,"Then Sir Thomas got his second wind and cursed the day that he, or it"
5972,T. INGELL.,"may have been we, were born. I feared that though he was a Radical he"
5973,T. INGELL.,"might apologise and, since he was an M.P., might lie his way out of the"
5974,T. INGELL.,difficulty. But he was utterly and truthfully beside himself. He asked
5975,T. INGELL.,"foolish questions--such as what we were doing in the village at all, and"
5976,T. INGELL.,how much blackmail Woodhouse expected to make out of him. But neither
5977,T. INGELL.,Woodhouse nor the sergeant nor the writhing solicitor listened. The
5978,T. INGELL.,"upshot of their talk, in the chimney-corner, was that Sir Thomas stood"
5979,T. INGELL.,engaged to appear next Monday before his brother magistrates on charges
5980,T. INGELL.,"of assault, disorderly conduct, and language calculated, etc. Ollyett"
5981,T. INGELL.,was specially careful about the language.
5982,T. INGELL.,
5983,T. INGELL.,Then we left. The village looked very pretty in the late light--pretty
5984,T. INGELL.,and tuneful as a nest of nightingales.
5985,T. INGELL.,
5986,T. INGELL.,"'You'll turn up on Monday, I hope,' said Woodhouse, when we reached"
5987,T. INGELL.,town. That was his only allusion to the affair.
5988,T. INGELL.,
5989,T. INGELL.,So we turned up--through a world still singing that the Earth was
5990,T. INGELL.,flat--at the little clay-coloured market-town with the large Corn
5991,T. INGELL.,Exchange and the small Jubilee memorial. We had some difficulty in
5992,T. INGELL.,getting seats in the court. Woodhouse's imported London lawyer was a man
5993,T. INGELL.,"of commanding personality, with a voice trained to convey blasting"
5994,T. INGELL.,"imputations by tone. When the case was called, he rose and stated his"
5995,T. INGELL.,"client's intention not to proceed with the charge. His client, he went"
5996,T. INGELL.,"on to say, had not entertained, and, of course, in the circumstances"
5997,T. INGELL.,"could not have entertained, any suggestion of accepting on behalf of"
5998,T. INGELL.,public charities any moneys that might have been offered to him on the
5999,T. INGELL.,"part of Sir Thomas's estate. At the same time, no one acknowledged more"
6000,T. INGELL.,sincerely than his client the spirit in which those offers had been made
6001,T. INGELL.,"by those entitled to make them. But, as a matter of fact--here he became"
6002,T. INGELL.,the man of the world colloguing with his equals--certain--er--details
6003,T. INGELL.,"had come to his client's knowledge _since_ the lamentable outburst,"
6004,T. INGELL.,which ... He shrugged his shoulders. Nothing was served by going into
6005,T. INGELL.,"them, but he ventured to say that, had those painful circumstances only"
6006,T. INGELL.,"been known earlier, his client would--again 'of course'--never have"
6007,T. INGELL.,"dreamed--A gesture concluded the sentence, and the ensnared Bench looked"
6008,T. INGELL.,"at Sir Thomas with new and withdrawing eyes. Frankly, as they could see,"
6009,T. INGELL.,it would be nothing less than cruelty to proceed further with
6010,T. INGELL.,"this--er-unfortunate affair. He asked leave, therefore, to withdraw the"
6011,T. INGELL.,"charge _in toto_, and at the same time to express his client's deepest"
6012,T. INGELL.,"sympathy with all who had been in any way distressed, as his client had"
6013,T. INGELL.,"been, by the fact and the publicity of proceedings which he could, of"
6014,T. INGELL.,"course, again assure them that his client would never have dreamed of"
6015,T. INGELL.,"instituting if, as he hoped he had made plain, certain facts had been"
6016,T. INGELL.,before his client at the time when.... But he had said enough. For his
6017,T. INGELL.,fee it seemed to me that he had.
6018,T. INGELL.,
6019,T. INGELL.,Heaven inspired Sir Thomas's lawyer--all of a sweat lest his client's
6020,T. INGELL.,"language should come out--to rise up and thank him. Then, Sir"
6021,T. INGELL.,"Thomas--not yet aware what leprosy had been laid upon him, but grateful"
6022,T. INGELL.,to escape on any terms--followed suit. He was heard in interested
6023,T. INGELL.,"silence, and people drew back a pace as Gehazi passed forth."
6024,T. INGELL.,
6025,T. INGELL.,"'You hit hard,' said Bat to Woodhouse afterwards. 'His own people think"
6026,T. INGELL.,he's mad.'
6027,T. INGELL.,
6028,T. INGELL.,'You don't say so? I'll show you some of his letters to-night at
6029,T. INGELL.,"dinner,' he replied."
6030,T. INGELL.,
6031,T. INGELL.,He brought them to the Red Amber Room of the Chop Suey. We forgot to be
6032,T. INGELL.,"amazed, as till then we had been amazed, over the Song or 'The Gubby,'"
6033,T. INGELL.,or the full tide of Fate that seemed to run only for our sakes. It did
6034,T. INGELL.,not even interest Ollyett that the verb 'to huckle' had passed into the
6035,T. INGELL.,English leader-writers' language. We were studying the interior of a
6036,T. INGELL.,"soul, flash-lighted to its grimiest corners by the dread of 'losing its"
6037,T. INGELL.,position.'
6038,T. INGELL.,
6039,T. INGELL.,"'And then it thanked you, didn't it, for dropping the case?' said"
6040,T. INGELL.,Pallant.
6041,T. INGELL.,
6042,T. INGELL.,"'Yes, and it sent me a telegram to confirm.' Woodhouse turned to Bat."
6043,T. INGELL.,'Now d'you think I hit too hard?' he asked.
6044,T. INGELL.,
6045,T. INGELL.,'No-o!' said Bat. 'After all--I'm talking of every one's business
6046,T. INGELL.,now--one can't ever do anything in Art that comes up to Nature in any
6047,T. INGELL.,game in life. Just think how this thing has--'
6048,T. INGELL.,
6049,T. INGELL.,"'Just let me run through that little case of yours again,' said Pallant,"
6050,T. INGELL.,and picked up _The Bun_ which had it set out in full.
6051,T. INGELL.,
6052,T. INGELL.,'Any chance of 'Dal looking in on us to-night?' Ollyett began.
6053,T. INGELL.,
6054,T. INGELL.,"'She's occupied with her Art too,' Bat answered bitterly. 'What's the"
6055,T. INGELL.,"use of Art? Tell me, some one!' A barrel-organ outside promptly pointed"
6056,T. INGELL.,"out that the _Earth_ was flat. 'The gramophone's killing street organs,"
6057,T. INGELL.,but I let loose a hundred-and-seventy-four of those hurdygurdys twelve
6058,T. INGELL.,"hours after The Song,' said Bat. 'Not counting the Provinces.' His face"
6059,T. INGELL.,brightened a little.
6060,T. INGELL.,
6061,T. INGELL.,'Look here!' said Pallant over the paper. 'I don't suppose you or those
6062,T. INGELL.,asinine J.P.'s knew it--but your lawyer ought to have known that you've
6063,T. INGELL.,all put your foot in it most confoundedly over this assault case.'
6064,T. INGELL.,
6065,T. INGELL.,'What's the matter?' said Woodhouse.
6066,T. INGELL.,
6067,T. INGELL.,'It's ludicrous. It's insane. There isn't two penn'orth of legality in
6068,T. INGELL.,"the whole thing. Of course, you could have withdrawn the charge, but the"
6069,T. INGELL.,way you went about it is childish--besides being illegal. What on earth
6070,T. INGELL.,was the Chief Constable thinking of?'
6071,T. INGELL.,
6072,T. INGELL.,"'Oh, he was a friend of Sir Thomas's. They all were for that matter,' I"
6073,T. INGELL.,replied.
6074,T. INGELL.,
6075,T. INGELL.,'He ought to be hanged. So ought the Chairman of the Bench. I'm talking
6076,T. INGELL.,as a lawyer now.'
6077,T. INGELL.,
6078,T. INGELL.,"'Why, what have we been guilty of? Misprision of treason or compounding"
6079,T. INGELL.,a felony--or what?' said Ollyett.
6080,T. INGELL.,
6081,T. INGELL.,'I'll tell you later.' Pallant went back to the paper with knitted
6082,T. INGELL.,"brows, smiling unpleasantly from time to time. At last he laughed."
6083,T. INGELL.,
6084,T. INGELL.,'Thank you!' he said to Woodhouse. 'It ought to be pretty useful--for
6085,T. INGELL.,us.'
6086,T. INGELL.,
6087,T. INGELL.,'What d'you mean?' said Ollyett.
6088,T. INGELL.,
6089,T. INGELL.,'For our side. They are all Rads who are mixed up in this--from the
6090,T. INGELL.,Chief Constable down. There must be a Question. There must be a
6091,T. INGELL.,Question.'
6092,T. INGELL.,
6093,T. INGELL.,"'Yes, but I wanted the charge withdrawn in my own way,' Woodhouse"
6094,T. INGELL.,insisted.
6095,T. INGELL.,
6096,T. INGELL.,'That's nothing to do with the case. It's the legality of your silly
6097,T. INGELL.,"methods. You wouldn't understand if I talked till morning,' He began to"
6098,T. INGELL.,"pace the room, his hands behind him. 'I wonder if I can get it through"
6099,T. INGELL.,our Whip's thick head that it's a chance.... That comes of stuffing the
6100,T. INGELL.,"Bench with radical tinkers,' he muttered."
6101,T. INGELL.,
6102,T. INGELL.,"'Oh, sit down!' said Woodhouse."
6103,T. INGELL.,
6104,T. INGELL.,'Where's your lawyer to be found now?' he jerked out.
6105,T. INGELL.,
6106,T. INGELL.,"'At the Trefoil,' said Bat promptly. 'I gave him the stage-box for"
6107,T. INGELL.,to-night. He's an artist too.'
6108,T. INGELL.,
6109,T. INGELL.,"'Then I'm going to see him,' said Pallant. 'Properly handled this ought"
6110,T. INGELL.,to be a godsend for our side.' He withdrew without apology.
6111,T. INGELL.,
6112,T. INGELL.,"'Certainly, this thing keeps on opening up, and up,' I remarked inanely."
6113,T. INGELL.,
6114,T. INGELL.,'It's beyond me!' said Bat. 'I don't think if I'd known I'd have
6115,T. INGELL.,"ever ... Yes, I would, though. He said my home address was--'"
6116,T. INGELL.,
6117,T. INGELL.,'It was his tone--his tone!' Ollyett almost shouted. Woodhouse said
6118,T. INGELL.,"nothing, but his face whitened as he brooded."
6119,T. INGELL.,
6120,T. INGELL.,"'Well, any way,' Bat went on, 'I'm glad I always believed in God and"
6121,T. INGELL.,Providence and all those things. Else I should lose my nerve. We've put
6122,T. INGELL.,it over the whole world--the full extent of the geographical globe. We
6123,T. INGELL.,couldn't stop it if we wanted to now. It's got to burn itself out. I'm
6124,T. INGELL.,not in charge any more. What d'you expect'll happen next. Angels?'
6125,T. INGELL.,
6126,T. INGELL.,I expected nothing. Nothing that I expected approached what I got.
6127,T. INGELL.,"Politics are not my concern, but, for the moment, since it seemed that"
6128,T. INGELL.,"they were going to 'huckle' with the rest, I took an interest in them."
6129,T. INGELL.,"They impressed me as a dog's life without a dog's decencies, and I was"
6130,T. INGELL.,confirmed in this when an unshaven and unwashen Pallant called on me at
6131,T. INGELL.,"ten o'clock one morning, begging for a bath and a couch."
6132,T. INGELL.,
6133,T. INGELL.,'Bail too?' I asked. He was in evening dress and his eyes were sunk feet
6134,T. INGELL.,in his head.
6135,T. INGELL.,
6136,T. INGELL.,"'No,' he said hoarsely. 'All night sitting. Fifteen divisions. 'Nother"
6137,T. INGELL.,"to-night. Your place was nearer than mine, so--' He began to undress"
6138,T. INGELL.,in the hall.
6139,T. INGELL.,
6140,T. INGELL.,When he awoke at one o'clock he gave me lurid accounts of what he said
6141,T. INGELL.,"was history, but which was obviously collective hysteria. There had been"
6142,T. INGELL.,a political crisis. He and his fellow M.P.'s had 'done things'--I never
6143,T. INGELL.,"quite got at the things--for eighteen hours on end, and the pitiless"
6144,T. INGELL.,Whips were even then at the telephones to herd 'em up to another
6145,T. INGELL.,dog-fight. So he snorted and grew hot all over again while he might have
6146,T. INGELL.,been resting.
6147,T. INGELL.,
6148,T. INGELL.,'I'm going to pitch in my question about that miscarriage of justice at
6149,T. INGELL.,"Huckley this afternoon, if you care to listen to it,' he said. 'It'll be"
6150,T. INGELL.,absolutely thrown away--in our present state. I told 'em so; but it's my
6151,T. INGELL.,only chance for weeks. P'raps Woodhouse would like to come.'
6152,T. INGELL.,
6153,T. INGELL.,"'I'm sure he would. Anything to do with Huckley interests us,' I said."
6154,T. INGELL.,
6155,T. INGELL.,"'It'll miss fire, I'm afraid. Both sides are absolutely cooked. The"
6156,T. INGELL.,present situation has been working up for some time. You see the row was
6157,T. INGELL.,"bound to come, etc. etc.,' and he flew off the handle once more."
6158,T. INGELL.,
6159,T. INGELL.,"I telephoned to Woodhouse, and we went to the House together. It was a"
6160,T. INGELL.,"dull, sticky afternoon with thunder in the air. For some reason or"
6161,T. INGELL.,"other, each side was determined to prove its virtue and endurance to the"
6162,T. INGELL.,utmost. I heard men snarling about it all round me. 'If they won't spare
6163,T. INGELL.,"us, we'll show 'em no mercy,' 'Break the brutes up from the start. They"
6164,T. INGELL.,can't stand late hours.' 'Come on! No shirking! I know _you've_ had a
6165,T. INGELL.,"Turkish bath,' were some of the sentences I caught on our way. The House"
6166,T. INGELL.,"was packed already, and one could feel the negative electricity of a"
6167,T. INGELL.,"jaded crowd wrenching at one's own nerves, and depressing the"
6168,T. INGELL.,afternoon soul.
6169,T. INGELL.,
6170,T. INGELL.,'This is bad!' Woodhouse whispered. 'There'll be a row before they've
6171,T. INGELL.,finished. Look at the Front Benches!' And he pointed out little personal
6172,T. INGELL.,signs by which I was to know that each man was on edge. He might have
6173,T. INGELL.,spared himself. The House was ready to snap before a bone had been
6174,T. INGELL.,thrown. A sullen minister rose to reply to a staccato question. His
6175,T. INGELL.,supporters cheered defiantly. 'None o' that! None o' that!' came from
6176,T. INGELL.,the Back Benches. I saw the Speaker's face stiffen like the face of a
6177,T. INGELL.,helmsman as he humours a hard-mouthed yacht after a sudden following
6178,T. INGELL.,"sea. The trouble was barely met in time. There came a fresh, apparently"
6179,T. INGELL.,"causeless gust a few minutes later--savage, threatening, but futile. It"
6180,T. INGELL.,died out--one could hear the sigh--in sudden wrathful realisation of
6181,T. INGELL.,"the dreary hours ahead, and the ship of state drifted on."
6182,T. INGELL.,
6183,T. INGELL.,Then Pallant--and the raw House winced at the torture of his
6184,T. INGELL.,"voice--rose. It was a twenty-line question, studded with legal"
6185,T. INGELL.,technicalities. The gist of it was that he wished to know whether the
6186,T. INGELL.,appropriate Minister was aware that there had been a grave miscarriage
6187,T. INGELL.,"of justice on such and such a date, at such and such a place, before"
6188,T. INGELL.,"such and such justices of the peace, in regard to a case which arose--"
6189,T. INGELL.,
6190,T. INGELL.,"I heard one desperate, weary 'damn!' float up from the pit of that"
6191,T. INGELL.,torment. Pallant sawed on--'out of certain events which occurred at the
6192,T. INGELL.,village of Huckley.'
6193,T. INGELL.,
6194,T. INGELL.,"The House came to attention with a parting of the lips like a hiccough,"
6195,T. INGELL.,"and it flashed through my mind.... Pallant repeated, 'Huckley. The"
6196,T. INGELL.,village--'
6197,T. INGELL.,
6198,T. INGELL.,'That voted the _Earth_ was flat.' A single voice from a back Bench sang
6199,T. INGELL.,it once like a lone frog in a far pool.
6200,T. INGELL.,
6201,T. INGELL.,"'_Earth_ was flat,' croaked another voice opposite."
6202,T. INGELL.,
6203,T. INGELL.,'_Earth_ was flat.' There were several. Then several more.
6204,T. INGELL.,
6205,T. INGELL.,"It was, you understand, the collective, overstrained nerve of the House,"
6206,T. INGELL.,"snapping, strand by strand to various notes, as the hawser parts from"
6207,T. INGELL.,its moorings.
6208,T. INGELL.,
6209,T. INGELL.,'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat.' The tune was beginning to
6210,T. INGELL.,shape itself. More voices were raised and feet began to beat time. Even
6211,T. INGELL.,so it did not occur to me that the thing would--
6212,T. INGELL.,
6213,T. INGELL.,'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat!' It was easier now to see
6214,T. INGELL.,who were not singing. There were still a few. Of a sudden (and this
6215,T. INGELL.,proves the fundamental instability of the cross-bench mind) a
6216,T. INGELL.,cross-bencher leaped on his seat and there played an imaginary
6217,T. INGELL.,double-bass with tremendous maestro-like wagglings of the elbow.
6218,T. INGELL.,
6219,T. INGELL.,The last strand parted. The ship of state drifted out helpless on the
6220,T. INGELL.,rocking tide of melody.
6221,T. INGELL.,
6222,T. INGELL.,'The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat!
6223,T. INGELL.,The Village that voted the _Earth_ was flat!'
6224,T. INGELL.,
6225,T. INGELL.,The Irish first conceived the idea of using their order-papers as
6226,T. INGELL.,funnels wherewith to reach the correct '_vroom--vroom_' on '_Earth_.'
6227,T. INGELL.,"Labour, always conservative and respectable at a crisis, stood out"
6228,T. INGELL.,"longer than any other section, but when it came in it was howling"
6229,T. INGELL.,"syndicalism. Then, without distinction of Party, fear of constituents,"
6230,T. INGELL.,"desire for office, or hope of emolument, the House sang at the tops and"
6231,T. INGELL.,"at the bottoms of their voices, swaying their stale bodies and"
6232,T. INGELL.,epileptically beating with their swelled feet. They sang 'The Village
6233,T. INGELL.,"that voted the _Earth_ was flat': first, because they wanted to, and"
6234,T. INGELL.,secondly--which is the terror of that song--because they could not stop.
6235,T. INGELL.,For no consideration could they stop.
6236,T. INGELL.,
6237,T. INGELL.,Pallant was still standing up. Some one pointed at him and they laughed.
6238,T. INGELL.,"Others began to point, lunging, as it were, in time with the tune. At"
6239,T. INGELL.,this moment two persons came in practically abreast from behind the
6240,T. INGELL.,"Speaker's chair, and halted appalled. One happened to be the Prime"
6241,T. INGELL.,"Minister and the other a messenger. The House, with tears running down"
6242,T. INGELL.,"their cheeks, transferred their attention to the paralysed couple. They"
6243,T. INGELL.,"pointed six hundred forefingers at them. They rocked, they waved, and"
6244,T. INGELL.,"they rolled while they pointed, but still they sang. When they weakened"
6245,T. INGELL.,"for an instant, Ireland would yell: 'Are ye _with_ me, bhoys?' and they"
6246,T. INGELL.,all renewed their strength like Antaeus. No man could say afterwards
6247,T. INGELL.,"what happened in the Press or the Strangers' Gallery. It was the House,"
6248,T. INGELL.,"the hysterical and abandoned House of Commons that held all eyes, as it"
6249,T. INGELL.,"deafened all ears. I saw both Front Benches bend forward, some with"
6250,T. INGELL.,"their foreheads on their despatch-boxes, the rest with their faces in"
6251,T. INGELL.,their hands; and their moving shoulders jolted the House out of its last
6252,T. INGELL.,rag of decency. Only the Speaker remained unmoved. The entire press of
6253,T. INGELL.,Great Britain bore witness next day that he had not even bowed his head.
6254,T. INGELL.,"The Angel of the Constitution, for vain was the help of man, foretold"
6255,T. INGELL.,him the exact moment at which the House would have broken into 'The
6256,T. INGELL.,Gubby.' He is reported to have said: 'I heard the Irish beginning to
6257,T. INGELL.,shuffle it. So I adjourned.' Pallant's version is that he added: 'And I
6258,T. INGELL.,was never so grateful to a private member in all my life as I was to
6259,T. INGELL.,Mr. Pallant.'
6260,T. INGELL.,
6261,T. INGELL.,He made no explanation. He did not refer to orders or disorders. He
6262,T. INGELL.,simply adjourned the House till six that evening. And the House
6263,T. INGELL.,adjourned--some of it nearly on all fours.
6264,T. INGELL.,
6265,T. INGELL.,I was not correct when I said that the Speaker was the only man who did
6266,T. INGELL.,not laugh. Woodhouse was beside me all the time. His face was set and
6267,T. INGELL.,"quite white--as white, they told me, as Sir Thomas Ingell's when he"
6268,T. INGELL.,"went, by request, to a private interview with his Chief Whip."

6325,THE PRESS,
6326,THE PRESS,"'So the matter,' the Regimental Chaplain concluded, 'was correct; in"
6327,THE PRESS,every way correct. I am well pleased with Rutton Singh and Attar Singh.
6328,THE PRESS,They have gathered the fruit of their lives.'
6329,THE PRESS,
6330,THE PRESS,"He folded his arms and sat down on the verandah. The hot day had ended,"
6331,THE PRESS,"and there was a pleasant smell of cooking along the regimental lines,"
6332,THE PRESS,where half-clad men went back and forth with leaf platters and
6333,THE PRESS,"water-goglets. The Subadar-Major, in extreme undress, sat on a chair, as"
6334,THE PRESS,"befitted his rank; the Havildar-Major, his nephew, leaning respectfully"
6335,THE PRESS,against the wall. The Regiment was at home and at ease in its own
6336,THE PRESS,quarters in its own district which takes its name from the great
6337,THE PRESS,"Muhammadan saint Mian Mir, revered by Jehangir and beloved by Guru Har"
6338,THE PRESS,"Gobind, sixth of the great Sikh Gurus."
6339,THE PRESS,
6340,THE PRESS,"'Quite correct,' the Regimental Chaplain repeated."
6341,THE PRESS,
6342,THE PRESS,No Sikh contradicts his Regimental Chaplain who expounds to him the Holy
6343,THE PRESS,Book of the Grunth Sahib and who knows the lives and legends of all
6344,THE PRESS,the Gurus.
6345,THE PRESS,
6346,THE PRESS,The Subadar-Major bowed his grey head. The Havildar-Major coughed
6347,THE PRESS,respectfully to attract attention and to ask leave to speak. Though he
6348,THE PRESS,"was the Subadar-Major's nephew, and though his father held twice as"
6349,THE PRESS,"much land as his uncle, he knew his place in the scheme of things. The"
6350,THE PRESS,Subadar-Major shifted one hand with an iron bracelet on the wrist.
6351,THE PRESS,
6352,THE PRESS,'Was there by any chance any woman at the back of it?' the
6353,THE PRESS,Havildar-Major murmured. 'I was not here when the thing happened.'
6354,THE PRESS,
6355,THE PRESS,'Yes! Yes! Yes! We all know that thou wast in England eating and
6356,THE PRESS,drinking with the Sahibs. We are all surprised that thou canst still
6357,THE PRESS,speak Punjabi.' The Subadar-Major's carefully-tended beard bristled.
6358,THE PRESS,
6359,THE PRESS,"'There was no woman,' the Regimental Chaplain growled. 'It was land."
6360,THE PRESS,"Hear, you! Rutton Singh and Attar Singh were the elder of four brothers."
6361,THE PRESS,"These four held land in--what was the village's name?--oh, Pishapur,"
6362,THE PRESS,"near Thori, in the Banalu Tehsil of Patiala State, where men can still"
6363,THE PRESS,recognise right behaviour when they see it. The two younger brothers
6364,THE PRESS,"tilled the land, while Rutton Singh and Attar Singh took service with"
6365,THE PRESS,"the Regiment, according to the custom of the family.'"
6366,THE PRESS,
6367,THE PRESS,"'True, true,' said the Havildar-Major. 'There is the same arrangement in"
6368,THE PRESS,all good families.'
6369,THE PRESS,
6370,THE PRESS,"'Then, listen again,' the Regimental Chaplain went on. 'Their kin on"
6371,THE PRESS,their mother's side put great oppression and injustice upon the two
6372,THE PRESS,younger brothers who stayed with the land in Patiala State. Their
6373,THE PRESS,mother's kin loosened beasts into the four brothers' crops when the
6374,THE PRESS,crops were green; they cut the corn by force when it was ripe; they
6375,THE PRESS,broke down the water-courses; they defiled the wells; and they brought
6376,THE PRESS,false charges in the law-courts against all four brothers. They did not
6377,THE PRESS,"spare even the cotton-seed, as the saying is."
6378,THE PRESS,
6379,THE PRESS,'Their mother's kin trusted that the young men would thus be forced by
6380,THE PRESS,"weight of trouble, and further trouble and perpetual trouble, to quit"
6381,THE PRESS,their lands in Pishapur village in Banalu Tehsil in Patiala State. If
6382,THE PRESS,"the young men ran away, the land would come whole to their mother's kin."
6383,THE PRESS,"I am not a regimental school-master, but is it understood, child?'"
6384,THE PRESS,
6385,THE PRESS,"'Understood,' said the Havildar-Major grimly. 'Pishapur is not the only"
6386,THE PRESS,place where the fence eats the field instead of protecting it. But
6387,THE PRESS,perhaps there was a woman among their mother's kin?'
6388,THE PRESS,
6389,THE PRESS,"'God knows!' said the Regimental Chaplain. 'Woman, or man, or"
6390,THE PRESS,"law-courts, the young men would _not_ be driven off the land which was"
6391,THE PRESS,their own by inheritance. They made appeal to Rutton Singh and Attar
6392,THE PRESS,"Singh, their brethren who had taken service with _us_ in the Regiment,"
6393,THE PRESS,"and so knew the world, to help them in their long war against their"
6394,THE PRESS,"mother's kin in Pishapur. For that reason, because their own land and"
6395,THE PRESS,"the honour of their house was dear to them, Rutton Singh and Attar Singh"
6396,THE PRESS,needs must very often ask for leave to go to Patiala and attend to the
6397,THE PRESS,lawsuits and cattle-poundings there.
6398,THE PRESS,
6399,THE PRESS,"'It was not, look you, as though they went back to their own village and"
6400,THE PRESS,"sat, garlanded with jasmine, in honour, upon chairs before the elders"
6401,THE PRESS,"under the trees. They went back always to perpetual trouble, either of"
6402,THE PRESS,"lawsuits, or theft, or strayed cattle; and they sat on thorns.'"
6403,THE PRESS,
6404,THE PRESS,"'I knew it,' said the Subadar-Major. 'Life was bitter for them both. But"
6405,THE PRESS,they were well-conducted men. It was not hard to get them their leave
6406,THE PRESS,from the Colonel Sahib.'
6407,THE PRESS,
6408,THE PRESS,"'They spoke to me also,' said the Chaplain. '_""Let him who desires the"
6409,THE PRESS,"four great gifts apply himself to the words of holy men.""_ That is"
6410,THE PRESS,written. Often they showed me the papers of the false lawsuits brought
6411,THE PRESS,against them. Often they wept on account of the persecution put upon
6412,THE PRESS,them by their mother's kin. Men thought it was drugs when their eyes
6413,THE PRESS,showed red.'
6414,THE PRESS,
6415,THE PRESS,"'They wept in my presence too,' said the Subadar-Major. 'Well-conducted"
6416,THE PRESS,"men of nine years' service apiece. Rutton Singh was drill-Naik, too.'"
6417,THE PRESS,
6418,THE PRESS,"'They did all things correctly as Sikhs should,' said the Regimental"
6419,THE PRESS,"Chaplain. 'When the persecution had endured seven years, Attar Singh"
6420,THE PRESS,took leave to Pishapur once again (that was the fourth time in that year
6421,THE PRESS,"only) and he called his persecutors together before the village elders,"
6422,THE PRESS,and he cast his turban at their feet and besought them by his mother's
6423,THE PRESS,blood to cease from their persecutions. For he told them earnestly that
6424,THE PRESS,"he had marched to the boundaries of his patience, and that there could"
6425,THE PRESS,be but one end to the matter.
6426,THE PRESS,
6427,THE PRESS,"'They gave him abuse. They mocked him and his tears, which was the same"
6428,THE PRESS,as though they had mocked the Regiment. Then Attar Singh returned to the
6429,THE PRESS,"Regiment, and laid this last trouble before Rutton Singh, the eldest"
6430,THE PRESS,brother. But Rutton Singh could not get leave all at once.'
6431,THE PRESS,
6432,THE PRESS,'Because he was drill-Naik and the recruits were to be drilled. I myself
6433,THE PRESS,"told him so,' said the Subadar-Major. 'He was a well-conducted man. He"
6434,THE PRESS,said he could wait.'
6435,THE PRESS,
6436,THE PRESS,"'But when permission was granted, those two took four days' leave,' the"
6437,THE PRESS,Chaplain went on.
6438,THE PRESS,
6439,THE PRESS,'I do not think Attar Singh should have taken Baynes Sahib's revolver.
6440,THE PRESS,"He was Baynes Sahib's orderly, and all that Sahib's things were open to"
6441,THE PRESS,"him. It was, therefore, as I count it, shame to Attar Singh,' said the"
6442,THE PRESS,Subadar-Major.
6443,THE PRESS,
6444,THE PRESS,"'All the words had been said. There was need of arms, and how could"
6445,THE PRESS,soldiers use Government rifles upon mere cultivators in the fields?' the
6446,THE PRESS,"Regimental Chaplain replied. 'Moreover, the revolver was sent back,"
6447,THE PRESS,"together with a money-order for the cartridges expended. _""Borrow not;"
6448,THE PRESS,"but if thou borrowest, pay back soon!""_ That is written in the Hymns."
6449,THE PRESS,"Rutton Singh took a sword, and he and Attar Singh went to Pishapur and,"
6450,THE PRESS,"after word given, the four brethren fell upon their persecutors in"
6451,THE PRESS,"Pishapur village and slew seventeen, wounding ten. A revolver is better"
6452,THE PRESS,"than a lawsuit. I say that these four brethren, the two with _us_, and"
6453,THE PRESS,"the two mere cultivators, slew and wounded twenty-seven--all their"
6454,THE PRESS,"mother's kin, male and female."
6455,THE PRESS,
6456,THE PRESS,"'Then the four mounted to their housetop, and Attar Singh, who was"
6457,THE PRESS,"always one of the impetuous, said ""My work is done,"" and he made"
6458,THE PRESS,"_shinan_ (purification) in all men's sight, and he lent Rutton Singh"
6459,THE PRESS,"Baynes Sahib's revolver, and Rutton Singh shot him in the head."
6460,THE PRESS,
6461,THE PRESS,"'So Attar Singh abandoned his body, as an insect abandons a blade of"
6462,THE PRESS,"grass. But Rutton Singh, having more work to do, went down from the"
6463,THE PRESS,housetop and sought an enemy whom he had forgotten--a Patiala man of
6464,THE PRESS,this regiment who had sided with the persecutors. When he overtook the
6465,THE PRESS,"man, Rutton Singh hit him twice with bullets and once with the sword.'"
6466,THE PRESS,
6467,THE PRESS,"'But the man escaped and is now in the hospital here,' said the"
6468,THE PRESS,Subadar-Major. 'The doctor says he will live in spite of all.'
6469,THE PRESS,
6470,THE PRESS,'Not Rutton Singh's fault. Rutton Singh left him for dead. Then Rutton
6471,THE PRESS,"Singh returned to the housetop, and the three brothers together, Attar"
6472,THE PRESS,"Singh being dead, sent word by a lad to the police station for an army"
6473,THE PRESS,to be dispatched against them that they might die with honours. But none
6474,THE PRESS,came. And yet Patiala State is not under English law and they should
6475,THE PRESS,know virtue there when they see it!
6476,THE PRESS,
6477,THE PRESS,"'So, on the third day, Rutton Singh also made _shinan_, and the youngest"
6478,THE PRESS,"of the brethren shot him also in the head, and _he_ abandoned his body."
6479,THE PRESS,
6480,THE PRESS,"'Thus was all correct. There was neither heat, nor haste, nor abuse in"
6481,THE PRESS,the matter from end to end. There remained alive not one man or woman of
6482,THE PRESS,their mother's kin which had oppressed them. Of the other villagers of
6483,THE PRESS,"Pishapur, who had taken no part in the persecutions, not one was slain."
6484,THE PRESS,"Indeed, the villagers sent them food on the housetop for those three"
6485,THE PRESS,days while they waited for the police who would not dispatch that army.
6486,THE PRESS,
6487,THE PRESS,'Listen again! I know that Attar Singh and Rutton Singh omitted no
6488,THE PRESS,"ceremony of the purifications, and when all was done Baynes Sahib's"
6489,THE PRESS,"revolver was thrown down from the housetop, together with three rupees"
6490,THE PRESS,twelve annas; and order was given for its return by post.'
6491,THE PRESS,
6492,THE PRESS,'And what befell the two younger brethren who were not in the service?'
6493,THE PRESS,the Havildar-Major asked.
6494,THE PRESS,
6495,THE PRESS,"'Doubtless they too are dead, but since they were not in the Regiment"
6496,THE PRESS,"their honour concerns themselves only. So far as _we_ were touched, see"
6497,THE PRESS,how correctly we came out of the matter! I think the King should be
6498,THE PRESS,told; for where could you match such a tale except among us Sikhs? _Sri
6499,THE PRESS,wah guru ji ki Khalsa! Sri wah guru ji ki futteh!_' said the
6500,THE PRESS,Regimental Chaplain.
6501,THE PRESS,
6502,THE PRESS,'Would three rupees twelve annas pay for the used cartridges?' said the
6503,THE PRESS,Havildar-Major.
6504,THE PRESS,
6505,THE PRESS,'Attar Singh knew the just price. All Baynes Sahib's gear was in his
6506,THE PRESS,"charge. They expended one tin box of fifty cartouches, lacking two which"
6507,THE PRESS,were returned. As I said--as I say--the arrangement was made not with
6508,THE PRESS,heat nor blasphemies as a Mussulman would have made it; not with cries
6509,THE PRESS,nor caperings as an idolater would have made it; but conformably to the
6510,THE PRESS,"ritual and doctrine of the Sikhs. Hear you! _""Though hundreds of"
6511,THE PRESS,amusements are offered to a child it cannot live without milk. If a man
6512,THE PRESS,be divorced from his soul and his soul's desire he certainly will not
6513,THE PRESS,"stop to play upon the road, but he will make haste with his"
6514,THE PRESS,"pilgrimage_."" That is written. I rejoice in my disciples.'"
6515,THE PRESS,
6516,THE PRESS,'True! True! Correct! Correct!' said the Subadar-Major. There was a
6517,THE PRESS,"long, easy silence. One heard a water-wheel creaking somewhere and the"
6518,THE PRESS,nearer sound of meal being ground in a quern.
6519,THE PRESS,
6520,THE PRESS,'But he--' the Chaplain pointed a scornful chin at the
6521,THE PRESS,Havildar-Major--'_he_ has been so long in England that--'
6522,THE PRESS,
6523,THE PRESS,"'Let the lad alone,' said his uncle. 'He was but two months there, and"
6524,THE PRESS,he was chosen for good cause.'
6525,THE PRESS,
6526,THE PRESS,"Theoretically, all Sikhs are equal. Practically, there are differences,"
6527,THE PRESS,"as none know better than well-born, land-owning folk, or long-descended"
6528,THE PRESS,chaplains from Amritsar.
6529,THE PRESS,
6530,THE PRESS,'Hast thou heard anything in England to match my tale?' the Chaplain
6531,THE PRESS,sneered.
6532,THE PRESS,
6533,THE PRESS,"'I saw more than I could understand, so I have locked up my stories in"
6534,THE PRESS,"my own mouth,' the Havildar-Major replied meekly."
6535,THE PRESS,
6536,THE PRESS,"'Stories? What stories? I know all the stories about England,' said the"
6537,THE PRESS,"Chaplain. 'I know that _terains_ run underneath their bazaars there, and"
6538,THE PRESS,"as for their streets stinking with _mota kahars_, only this morning I"
6539,THE PRESS,was nearly killed by Duggan Sahib's _mota-kahar_. That young man is
6540,THE PRESS,a devil.'
6541,THE PRESS,
6542,THE PRESS,"'I expect Grunthi-jee,' said the Subadar-Major, 'you and I grow too old"
6543,THE PRESS,to care for the Kahar-ki-nautch--the Bearer's dance.' He named one of
6544,THE PRESS,"the sauciest of the old-time nautches, and smiled at his own pun. Then"
6545,THE PRESS,he turned to his nephew. 'When I was a lad and came back to my village
6546,THE PRESS,"on leave, I waited the convenient hour, and, the elders giving"
6547,THE PRESS,"permission, I spoke of what I had seen elsewhere.'"
6548,THE PRESS,
6549,THE PRESS,"'Ay, my father,' said the Havildar-Major, softly and affectionately. He"
6550,THE PRESS,"sat himself down with respect, as behoved a mere lad of thirty with a"
6551,THE PRESS,bare half-dozen campaigns to his credit.
6552,THE PRESS,
6553,THE PRESS,"'There were four men in this affair also,' he began, 'and it was an"
6554,THE PRESS,"affair that touched the honour, not of one regiment, nor two, but of all"
6555,THE PRESS,the Army in Hind. Some part of it I saw; some I heard; but _all_ the
6556,THE PRESS,"tale is true. My father's brother knows, and my priest knows, that I was"
6557,THE PRESS,"in England on business with my Colonel, when the King--the Great Queen's"
6558,THE PRESS,son--completed his life.
6559,THE PRESS,
6560,THE PRESS,"'First, there was a rumour that sickness was upon him. Next, we knew"
6561,THE PRESS,that he lay sick in the Palace. A very great multitude stood outside the
6562,THE PRESS,"Palace by night and by day, in the rain as well as the sun, waiting"
6563,THE PRESS,for news.
6564,THE PRESS,
6565,THE PRESS,"'Then came out one with a written paper, and set it upon a"
6566,THE PRESS,"gate-side--the word of the King's death--and they read, and groaned."
6567,THE PRESS,"This I saw with my own eyes, because the office where my Colonel Sahib"
6568,THE PRESS,went daily to talk with Colonel Forsyth Sahib was at the east end of the
6569,THE PRESS,very gardens where the Palace stood. They are larger gardens than
6570,THE PRESS,Shalimar here'--he pointed with his chin up the lines--'or Shahdera
6571,THE PRESS,across the river.
6572,THE PRESS,
6573,THE PRESS,"'Next day there was a darkness in the streets, because all the city's"
6574,THE PRESS,"multitude were clad in black garments, and they spoke as a man speaks in"
6575,THE PRESS,"the presence of his dead--all those multitudes. In the eyes, in the air,"
6576,THE PRESS,"and in the heart, there was blackness. I saw it. But that is not"
6577,THE PRESS,my tale.
6578,THE PRESS,
6579,THE PRESS,"'After ceremonies had been accomplished, and word had gone out to the"
6580,THE PRESS,"Kings of the Earth that they should come and mourn, the new King--the"
6581,THE PRESS,"dead King's son--gave commandment that his father's body should be laid,"
6582,THE PRESS,"coffined, in a certain Temple which is near the river. There are no"
6583,THE PRESS,"idols in that Temple; neither any carvings, nor paintings, nor gildings."
6584,THE PRESS,"It is all grey stone, of one colour as though it were cut out of the"
6585,THE PRESS,"live rock. It is larger than--yes, than the Durbar Sahib at Amritsar,"
6586,THE PRESS,even though the Akal Bunga and the Baba-Atal were added. How old it may
6587,THE PRESS,be God knows. It is the Sahibs' most sacred Temple.
6588,THE PRESS,
6589,THE PRESS,"'In that place, by the new King's commandment, they made, as it were, a"
6590,THE PRESS,"shrine for a saint, with lighted candles at the head and the feet of the"
6591,THE PRESS,"Dead, and duly appointed watchers for every hour of the day and the"
6592,THE PRESS,"night, until the dead King should be taken to the place of his fathers,"
6593,THE PRESS,which is at Wanidza.
6594,THE PRESS,
6595,THE PRESS,"'When all was in order, the new King said, ""Give entrance to all"
6596,THE PRESS,"people,"" and the doors were opened, and O my uncle! O my teacher! all"
6597,THE PRESS,"the world entered, walking through that Temple to take farewell of the"
6598,THE PRESS,"Dead. There was neither distinction, nor price, nor ranking in the host,"
6599,THE PRESS,except an order that they should walk by fours.
6600,THE PRESS,
6601,THE PRESS,"'As they gathered in the streets without--very, very far off--so they"
6602,THE PRESS,"entered the Temple, walking by fours: the child, the old man; mother,"
6603,THE PRESS,"virgin, harlot, trader, priest; of all colours and faiths and customs"
6604,THE PRESS,"under the firmament of God, from dawn till late at night. I saw it. My"
6605,THE PRESS,"Colonel gave me leave to go. I stood in the line, many hours, one"
6606,THE PRESS,"_koss_, two _koss_, distant from the temple.'"
6607,THE PRESS,
6608,THE PRESS,'Then why did the multitude not sit down under the trees?' asked the
6609,THE PRESS,priest.
6610,THE PRESS,
6611,THE PRESS,"'Because we were still between houses. The city is many _koss_ wide,'"
6612,THE PRESS,the Havildar-Major resumed. 'I submitted myself to that slow-moving
6613,THE PRESS,river and thus--thus--a pace at a time--I made pilgrimage. There were in
6614,THE PRESS,"my rank a woman, a cripple, and a lascar from the ships."
6615,THE PRESS,
6616,THE PRESS,"'When we entered the Temple, the coffin itself was as a shoal in the"
6617,THE PRESS,"Ravi River, splitting the stream into two branches, one on either side"
6618,THE PRESS,"of the Dead; and the watchers of the Dead, who were soldiers, stood"
6619,THE PRESS,"about It, moving no more than the still flame of the candles. Their"
6620,THE PRESS,heads were bowed; their hands were clasped; their eyes were cast upon
6621,THE PRESS,"the ground--thus. They were not men, but images, and the multitude went"
6622,THE PRESS,"past them in fours by day, and, except for a little while, by"
6623,THE PRESS,night also.
6624,THE PRESS,
6625,THE PRESS,"'No, there was no order that the people should come to pay respect. It"
6626,THE PRESS,was a free-will pilgrimage. Eight kings had been commanded to come--who
6627,THE PRESS,obeyed--but upon his own Sahibs the new King laid no commandment. Of
6628,THE PRESS,themselves they came.
6629,THE PRESS,
6630,THE PRESS,"'I made pilgrimage twice: once for my Salt's sake, and once again for"
6631,THE PRESS,wonder and terror and worship. But my mouth cannot declare one thing of
6632,THE PRESS,"a hundred thousand things in this matter. There were _lakhs_ of _lakhs_,"
6633,THE PRESS,_crores_ of _crores_ of people. I saw them.'
6634,THE PRESS,
6635,THE PRESS,'More than at our great pilgrimages?' the Regimental Chaplain demanded.
6636,THE PRESS,
6637,THE PRESS,'Yes. Those are only cities and districts coming out to pray. This was
6638,THE PRESS,"the world walking in grief. And now, hear you! It is the King's custom"
6639,THE PRESS,that four swords of Our Armies in Hind should stand always before the
6640,THE PRESS,Presence in case of need.'
6641,THE PRESS,
6642,THE PRESS,"'The King's custom, our right,' said the Subadar-Major curtly."
6643,THE PRESS,
6644,THE PRESS,'Also our right. These honoured ones are changed after certain months or
6645,THE PRESS,"years, that the honour may be fairly spread. Now it chanced that when"
6646,THE PRESS,"the old King--the Queen's son--completed his days, the four that stood"
6647,THE PRESS,"in the Presence were Goorkhas. Neither Sikhs alas, nor Pathans, Rajputs,"
6648,THE PRESS,"nor Jats. Goorkhas, my father.'"
6649,THE PRESS,
6650,THE PRESS,"'Idolaters,' said the Chaplain."
6651,THE PRESS,
6652,THE PRESS,'But soldiers; for I remember in the Tirah--' the Havildar-Major began.
6653,THE PRESS,
6654,THE PRESS,"'_But_ soldiers, for I remember fifteen campaigns. Go on,' said the"
6655,THE PRESS,Subadar-Major.
6656,THE PRESS,
6657,THE PRESS,'And it was their honour and right to furnish one who should stand in
6658,THE PRESS,the Presence by day and by night till It went out to burial. There were
6659,THE PRESS,no more than four all told--four old men to furnish that guard.'
6660,THE PRESS,
6661,THE PRESS,'Old? Old? What talk is this of old men?' said the Subadar-Major.
6662,THE PRESS,
6663,THE PRESS,'Nay. My fault! Your pardon!' The Havildar-Major spread a deprecating
6664,THE PRESS,"hand. 'They were strong, hot, valiant men, and the youngest was a lad of"
6665,THE PRESS,forty-five.'
6666,THE PRESS,
6667,THE PRESS,"'That is better,' the Subadar-Major laughed."
6668,THE PRESS,
6669,THE PRESS,'But for all their strength and heat they could not eat strange food
6670,THE PRESS,from the Sahibs' hands. There was no cooking place in the Temple; but a
6671,THE PRESS,"certain Colonel Forsyth Sahib, who had understanding, made arrangement"
6672,THE PRESS,whereby they should receive at least a little caste-clean parched grain;
6673,THE PRESS,"also cold rice maybe, and water which was pure. Yet, at best, this was"
6674,THE PRESS,"no more than a hen's mouthful, snatched as each came off his guard. They"
6675,THE PRESS,"lived on grain and were thankful, as the saying is."
6676,THE PRESS,
6677,THE PRESS,"'One hour's guard in every four was each man's burden, for, as I have"
6678,THE PRESS,"shown, they were but four all told; and the honour of Our Armies in Hind"
6679,THE PRESS,was on their heads. The Sahibs could draw upon all the armies in England
6680,THE PRESS,for the other watchers--thousands upon thousands of fresh men--if they
6681,THE PRESS,needed; but these four were but four.
6682,THE PRESS,
6683,THE PRESS,'The Sahibs drew upon the Granadeers for the other watchers. Granadeers
6684,THE PRESS,"be very tall men under very tall bearskins, such as Fusilier regiments"
6685,THE PRESS,"wear in cold weather. Thus, when a Granadeer bowed his head but a very"
6686,THE PRESS,"little over his stock, the bearskin sloped and showed as though he"
6687,THE PRESS,"grieved exceedingly. Now the Goorkhas wear flat, green caps--'"
6688,THE PRESS,
6689,THE PRESS,"'I see, I see,' said the Subadar-Major impatiently."
6690,THE PRESS,
6691,THE PRESS,"'They are bull-necked, too; and their stocks are hard, and when they"
6692,THE PRESS,bend deeply--deeply--to match the Granadeers--they come nigh to choking
6693,THE PRESS,"themselves. That was a handicap against them, when it came to the"
6694,THE PRESS,observance of ritual.
6695,THE PRESS,
6696,THE PRESS,"'Yet even with their tall, grief-declaring bearskins, the Granadeers"
6697,THE PRESS,could not endure the full hour's guard in the Presence. There was good
6698,THE PRESS,"cause, as I will show, why no man could endure that terrible hour. So"
6699,THE PRESS,for them the hour's guard was cut to one-half. What did it matter to the
6700,THE PRESS,"Sahibs? They could draw on ten thousand Granadeers. Forsyth Sahib, who"
6701,THE PRESS,"had comprehension, put this choice also before the four, and they said,"
6702,THE PRESS,"""No, ours is the Honour of the Armies of Hind. Whatever the Sahibs do,"
6703,THE PRESS,"we will suffer the full hour."""
6704,THE PRESS,
6705,THE PRESS,"'Forsyth Sahib, seeing that they were--knowing that they could neither"
6706,THE PRESS,"sleep long nor eat much, said, ""Is it great suffering?"" They said, ""It"
6707,THE PRESS,"is great honour. We will endure."""
6708,THE PRESS,
6709,THE PRESS,"'Forsyth Sahib, who loves us, said then to the eldest, ""Ho, father, tell"
6710,THE PRESS,me truly what manner of burden it is; for the full hour's watch breaks
6711,THE PRESS,"up our men like water."""
6712,THE PRESS,
6713,THE PRESS,"'The eldest answered, ""Sahib, the burden is the feet of the multitude"
6714,THE PRESS,"that pass us on either side. Our eyes being lowered and fixed, we see"
6715,THE PRESS,"those feet only from the knee down--a river of feet, Sahib, that"
6716,THE PRESS,never--never--never stops. It is not the standing without any motion; it
6717,THE PRESS,is not hunger; nor is it the dead part before the dawn when maybe a
6718,THE PRESS,single one comes here to weep. It is the burden of the unendurable
6719,THE PRESS,"procession of feet from the knee down, that never--never--never stops!"""
6720,THE PRESS,
6721,THE PRESS,"'Forsyth Sahib said, ""By God, I had not considered that! Now I know why"
6722,THE PRESS,"our men come trembling and twitching off that guard. But at least, my"
6723,THE PRESS,"father, ease the stock a little beneath the bent chin for that"
6724,THE PRESS,"one hour."""
6725,THE PRESS,
6726,THE PRESS,"'The eldest said, ""We are in the Presence. Moreover _He_ knew every"
6727,THE PRESS,"button and braid and hook of every uniform in all His armies."""
6728,THE PRESS,
6729,THE PRESS,"'Then Forsyth Sahib said no more, except to speak about their parched"
6730,THE PRESS,"grain, but indeed they could not eat much after their hour, nor could"
6731,THE PRESS,they sleep much because of eye-twitchings and the renewed procession of
6732,THE PRESS,the feet before the eyes. Yet they endured each his full hour--not half
6733,THE PRESS,an hour--his one full hour in each four hours.'
6734,THE PRESS,
6735,THE PRESS,'Correct! correct!' said the Subadar-Major and the Chaplain together.
6736,THE PRESS,'We come well out of this affair.'
6737,THE PRESS,
6738,THE PRESS,"'But seeing that they were old men,' said the Subadar-Major"
6739,THE PRESS,"reflectively, 'very old men, worn out by lack of food and sleep, could"
6740,THE PRESS,"not arrangements have been made, or influence have been secured, or a"
6741,THE PRESS,"petition presented, whereby a well-born Sikh might have eased them of"
6742,THE PRESS,"some portion of their great burden, even though his substantive rank--'"
6743,THE PRESS,
6744,THE PRESS,"'Then they would most certainly have slain me,' said the Havildar-Major"
6745,THE PRESS,with a smile.
6746,THE PRESS,
6747,THE PRESS,"'And they would have done correctly,' said the Chaplain. 'What befell"
6748,THE PRESS,the honourable ones later?'
6749,THE PRESS,
6750,THE PRESS,'This. The Kings of the earth and all the Armies sent flowers and
6751,THE PRESS,"such-like to the dead King's palace at Wanidza, where the funeral"
6752,THE PRESS,"offerings were accepted. There was no order given, but all the world"
6753,THE PRESS,made oblation. So the four took counsel--three at a time--and either
6754,THE PRESS,"they asked Forsyth Sahib to choose flowers, or themselves they went"
6755,THE PRESS,"forth and bought flowers--I do not know; but, however it was arranged,"
6756,THE PRESS,the flowers were bought and made in the shape of a great drum-like
6757,THE PRESS,circle weighing half a _maund_.
6758,THE PRESS,
6759,THE PRESS,"'Forsyth Sahib had said, ""Let the flowers be sent to Wanidza with the"
6760,THE PRESS,"other flowers which all the world is sending."" But they said among"
6761,THE PRESS,"themselves, ""It is not fit that these flowers, which are the offerings"
6762,THE PRESS,"of His Armies in Hind, should come to the Palace of the Presence by the"
6763,THE PRESS,"hands of hirelings or messengers, or of any man not in His service."""
6764,THE PRESS,
6765,THE PRESS,"'Hearing this, Forsyth Sahib, though he was much occupied with"
6766,THE PRESS,"office-work, said, ""Give me the flowers, and I will steal a time and"
6767,THE PRESS,"myself take them to Wanidza."""
6768,THE PRESS,
6769,THE PRESS,"'The eldest said, ""Since when has Forsyth Sahib worn sword?"""
6770,THE PRESS,
6771,THE PRESS,"'Forsyth Sahib said, ""But always. And I wear it in the Presence when I"
6772,THE PRESS,"put on uniform. I am a Colonel in the Armies of Hind."" The eldest said,"
6773,THE PRESS,"""Of what regiment?"" And Forsyth Sahib looked on the carpet and pulled"
6774,THE PRESS,the hair of his lip. He saw the trap.'
6775,THE PRESS,
6776,THE PRESS,'Forsyth Sahib's regiment was once the old Forty-sixth Pathans which
6777,THE PRESS,"was called--' the Subadar-Major gave the almost forgotten title, adding"
6778,THE PRESS,"that he had met them in such and such campaigns, when Forsyth Sahib was"
6779,THE PRESS,a young captain.
6780,THE PRESS,
6781,THE PRESS,"The Havildar-Major took up the tale, saying, 'The eldest knew that also,"
6782,THE PRESS,"my father. He laughed, and presently Forsyth Sahib laughed."
6783,THE PRESS,
6784,THE PRESS,"'""It is true,"" said Forsyth Sahib. ""I have no regiment. For twenty years"
6785,THE PRESS,I have been a clerk tied to a thick pen. Therefore I am the more fit to
6786,THE PRESS,"be your orderly and messenger in this business."""
6787,THE PRESS,
6788,THE PRESS,"'The eldest then said, ""If it were a matter of my life or the honour of"
6789,THE PRESS,"_any_ of my household, it would be easy."" And Forsyth Sahib joined his"
6790,THE PRESS,"hands together, half laughing, though he was ready to weep, and he said,"
6791,THE PRESS,"""Enough! I ask pardon. Which one of you goes with the offering?"""
6792,THE PRESS,
6793,THE PRESS,"'The eldest said, feigning not to have heard, ""Nor must they be"
6794,THE PRESS,delivered by a single sword--as though we were pressed for men in His
6795,THE PRESS,"service,"" and they saluted and went out.'"
6796,THE PRESS,
6797,THE PRESS,"'Were these things seen, or were they told thee?' said the"
6798,THE PRESS,Subadar-Major.
6799,THE PRESS,
6800,THE PRESS,'I both saw and heard in the office full of books and papers where my
6801,THE PRESS,Colonel Sahib consulted Forsyth Sahib upon the business that had brought
6802,THE PRESS,my Colonel Sahib to England.'
6803,THE PRESS,
6804,THE PRESS,"'And what was that business?' the Regimental Chaplain asked of a sudden,"
6805,THE PRESS,"looking full at the Havildar-Major, who returned the look without"
6806,THE PRESS,a quiver.
6807,THE PRESS,
6808,THE PRESS,"'That was not revealed to me,' said the Havildar-Major."
6809,THE PRESS,
6810,THE PRESS,'I heard it might have been some matter touching the integrity of
6811,THE PRESS,"certain regiments,' the Chaplain insisted."
6812,THE PRESS,
6813,THE PRESS,"'The matter was not in any way open to my ears,' said the"
6814,THE PRESS,Havildar-Major.
6815,THE PRESS,
6816,THE PRESS,'Humph!' The Chaplain drew his hard road-worn feet under his robe. 'Let
6817,THE PRESS,"us hear the tale that it is permitted thee to tell,' he said, and the"
6818,THE PRESS,Havildar-Major went on:
6819,THE PRESS,
6820,THE PRESS,"'So then the three, having returned to the Temple, called the fourth,"
6821,THE PRESS,"who had only forty-five years, when he came off guard, and said, ""We go"
6822,THE PRESS,to the Palace at Wanidza with the offerings. Remain thou in the
6823,THE PRESS,"Presence, and take all our guards, one after the other, till we return."""
6824,THE PRESS,
6825,THE PRESS,'Within that next hour they hired a large and strong _mota-kahar_ for
6826,THE PRESS,"the journey from the Temple to Wanidza, which is twenty _koss_ or more,"
6827,THE PRESS,"and they promised expedition. But he who took their guards said, ""It is"
6828,THE PRESS,not seemly that we should for any cause appear to be in haste. There are
6829,THE PRESS,eighteen medals with eleven clasps and three Orders to consider. Go at
6830,THE PRESS,"leisure. I can endure."""
6831,THE PRESS,
6832,THE PRESS,"'So the three with the offerings were absent three hours and a half, and"
6833,THE PRESS,having delivered the offering at Wanidza in the correct manner they
6834,THE PRESS,"returned and found the lad on guard, and they did not break his guard"
6835,THE PRESS,till his full hour was ended. So _he_ endured four hours in the
6836,THE PRESS,"Presence, not stirring one hair, his eyes abased, and the river of"
6837,THE PRESS,"feet, from the knee down, passing continually before his eyes. When he"
6838,THE PRESS,"was relieved, it was seen that his eyeballs worked like"
6839,THE PRESS,weavers' shuttles.
6840,THE PRESS,
6841,THE PRESS,"'And so it was done--not in hot blood, not for a little while, nor yet"
6842,THE PRESS,"with the smell of slaughter and the noise of shouting to sustain, but in"
6843,THE PRESS,"silence, for a very long time, rooted to one place before the Presence"
6844,THE PRESS,among the most terrible feet of the multitude.'
6845,THE PRESS,
6846,THE PRESS,'Correct!' the Chaplain chuckled.
6847,THE PRESS,
6848,THE PRESS,"'But the Goorkhas had the honour,' said the Subadar-Major sadly."
6849,THE PRESS,
6850,THE PRESS,"'Theirs was the Honour of His Armies in Hind, and that was Our Honour,'"
6851,THE PRESS,the nephew replied.
6852,THE PRESS,
6853,THE PRESS,'Yet I would one Sikh had been concerned in it--even one low-caste Sikh.
6854,THE PRESS,And after?'
6855,THE PRESS,
6856,THE PRESS,'They endured the burden until the end--until It went out of the Temple
6857,THE PRESS,to be laid among the older kings at Wanidza. When all was accomplished
6858,THE PRESS,"and It was withdrawn under the earth, Forsyth Sahib said to the four,"
6859,THE PRESS,"""The King gives command that you be fed here on meat cooked by your own"
6860,THE PRESS,"cooks. Eat and take ease, my fathers."""
6861,THE PRESS,
6862,THE PRESS,'So they loosed their belts and ate. They had not eaten food except by

6928,REGULUS,"next year defeated and taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, who sent him"
6929,REGULUS,to Rome with an embassy to ask for peace or an exchange of prisoners.
6930,REGULUS,Regulus strongly advised the Roman Senate to make no terms with the
6931,REGULUS,enemy. He then returned to Carthage and was put to death._
6932,REGULUS,
6933,REGULUS,"The Fifth Form had been dragged several times in its collective life,"
6934,REGULUS,from one end of the school Horace to the other. Those were the years
6935,REGULUS,"when Army examiners gave thousands of marks for Latin, and it was Mr."
6936,REGULUS,King's hated business to defeat them.
6937,REGULUS,
6938,REGULUS,"Hear him, then, on a raw November morning at second lesson."
6939,REGULUS,
6940,REGULUS,"'Aha!' he began, rubbing his hands. '_Cras ingens iterabimus aequor._"
6941,REGULUS,"Our portion to-day is the Fifth Ode of the Third Book, I"
6942,REGULUS,"believe--concerning one Regulus, a gentleman. And how often have we been"
6943,REGULUS,through it?'
6944,REGULUS,
6945,REGULUS,"'Twice, sir,' said Malpass, head of the Form."
6946,REGULUS,
6947,REGULUS,"Mr. King shuddered. 'Yes, twice, quite literally,' he said. 'To-day,"
6948,REGULUS,with an eye to your Army _viva-voce_ examinations--ugh!--I shall exact
6949,REGULUS,somewhat freer and more florid renditions. With feeling and
6950,REGULUS,comprehension if that be possible. I except'--here his eye swept the
6951,REGULUS,"back benches--'our friend and companion Beetle, from whom, now as"
6952,REGULUS,"always, I demand an absolutely literal translation.' The form laughed"
6953,REGULUS,subserviently.
6954,REGULUS,
6955,REGULUS,'Spare his blushes! Beetle charms us first.'
6956,REGULUS,
6957,REGULUS,"Beetle stood up, confident in the possession of a guaranteed construe,"
6958,REGULUS,"left behind by M'Turk, who had that day gone into the sick-house with a"
6959,REGULUS,cold. Yet he was too wary a hand to show confidence.
6960,REGULUS,
6961,REGULUS,"'_Credidimus_, we--believe--we have believed,' he opened in"
6962,REGULUS,"hesitating slow time, '_tonantem Joven_, thundering Jove--_regnare_,"
6963,REGULUS,"to reign--_caelo_, in heaven. _Augustus_, Augustus--_habebitur_,"
6964,REGULUS,"will be held or considered--_praesens divus_, a present"
6965,REGULUS,"God--_adjectis Britannis_, the Britons being added--_imperio_, to the"
6966,REGULUS,"Empire--_gravibusque Persis_, with the heavy--er, stern Persians.'"
6967,REGULUS,
6968,REGULUS,'What?'
6969,REGULUS,
6970,REGULUS,'The grave or stern Persians.' Beetle pulled up with the
6971,REGULUS,'Thank-God-I-have-done-my-duty' air of Nelson in the cockpit.
6972,REGULUS,
6973,REGULUS,"'I am quite aware,' said King, 'that the first stanza is about the"
6974,REGULUS,"extent of your knowledge, but continue, sweet one, continue. _Gravibus_,"
6975,REGULUS,"by the way, is usually translated as ""troublesome.""'"
6976,REGULUS,
6977,REGULUS,Beetle drew a long and tortured breath. The second stanza (which carries
6978,REGULUS,over to the third) of that Ode is what is technically called a
6979,REGULUS,'stinker.' But M'Turk had done him handsomely.
6980,REGULUS,
6981,REGULUS,"'_Milesne Crassi_, had--has the soldier of Crassus--_vixit_,"
6982,REGULUS,"lived--_turpis maritus_, a disgraceful husband--'"
6983,REGULUS,
6984,REGULUS,"'You slurred the quantity of the word after _turpis_,' said King. 'Let's"
6985,REGULUS,hear it.'
6986,REGULUS,
6987,REGULUS,"Beetle guessed again, and for a wonder hit the correct quantity. 'Er--a"
6988,REGULUS,"disgraceful husband--_conjuge barbara_, with a barbarous spouse.'"
6989,REGULUS,
6990,REGULUS,'Why do you select _that_ disgustful equivalent out of all the
6991,REGULUS,"dictionary?' King snapped. 'Isn't ""wife"" good enough for you?'"
6992,REGULUS,
6993,REGULUS,"'Yes, sir. But what do I do about this bracket, sir? Shall I take it"
6994,REGULUS,now?'
6995,REGULUS,
6996,REGULUS,'Confine yourself at present to the soldier of Crassus.'
6997,REGULUS,
6998,REGULUS,"'Yes, sir. _Et_, and--_consenuit_, has he grown old--_in armis_, in"
6999,REGULUS,"the--er--arms--_hositum socerorum_, of his father-in-law's enemies.'"
7000,REGULUS,
7001,REGULUS,'Who? How? Which?'
7002,REGULUS,
7003,REGULUS,"'Arms of his enemies' fathers-in-law, sir.'"
7004,REGULUS,
7005,REGULUS,"'Tha-anks. By the way, what meaning might you attach to _in armis_?'"
7006,REGULUS,
7007,REGULUS,"'Oh, weapons--weapons of war, sir.' There was a virginal note in"
7008,REGULUS,Beetle's voice as though he had been falsely accused of uttering
7009,REGULUS,"indecencies. 'Shall I take the bracket now, sir?'"
7010,REGULUS,
7011,REGULUS,'Since it seems to be troubling you.'
7012,REGULUS,
7013,REGULUS,"'_Pro Curia_, O for the Senate House--_inversique mores_, and manners"
7014,REGULUS,upset--upside down.'
7015,REGULUS,

7017,REGULUS,
7018,REGULUS,"'_Sub rege Medo_, under a Median King--_Marsus et Apulus_, he being a"
7019,REGULUS,Marsian and an Apulian.'
7020,REGULUS,
7021,REGULUS,'Who? The Median King?'
7022,REGULUS,
7023,REGULUS,"'No, sir. The soldier of Crassus. _Oblittus_ agrees with _milesne"
7024,REGULUS,"Crassi_, sir,' volunteered too-hasty Beetle."
7025,REGULUS,
7026,REGULUS,'Does it? It doesn't with _me_.'
7027,REGULUS,
7028,REGULUS,"'_Oh-blight-us_,' Beetle corrected hastily, 'forgetful--_anciliorum_, of"
7029,REGULUS,"the shields, or trophies--_et nominis_, and the--his name--_et togae_,"
7030,REGULUS,"and the toga--_eternaeque Vestae_, and eternal Vesta--_incolumi Jove_,"
7031,REGULUS,"Jove being safe--_et urbe Roma_, and the Roman city.' With an air of"
7032,REGULUS,"hardly restrained zeal--'Shall I go on, sir?'"
7033,REGULUS,
7034,REGULUS,"Mr. King winced. 'No, thank you. You have indeed given us a translation!"
7035,REGULUS,May I ask if it conveys any meaning whatever to your so-called mind?'
7036,REGULUS,
7037,REGULUS,"'Oh, I think so, sir.' This with gentle toleration for Horace and all"
7038,REGULUS,his works.
7039,REGULUS,
7040,REGULUS,'We envy you. Sit down.'
7041,REGULUS,
7042,REGULUS,"Beetle sat down relieved, well knowing that a reef of uncharted"
7043,REGULUS,"genitives stretched ahead of him, on which in spite of M'Turk's"
7044,REGULUS,sailing-directions he would infallibly have been wrecked.
7045,REGULUS,
7046,REGULUS,"Rattray, who took up the task, steered neatly through them and came"
7047,REGULUS,unscathed to port.
7048,REGULUS,
7049,REGULUS,"'Here we require drama,' said King. 'Regulus himself is speaking now."
7050,REGULUS,"Who shall represent the provident-minded Regulus? Winton, will you"
7051,REGULUS,kindly oblige?'
7052,REGULUS,
7053,REGULUS,"Winton of King's House, a long, heavy, tow-headed Second Fifteen"
7054,REGULUS,"forward, overdue for his First Fifteen colours, and in aspect like an"
7055,REGULUS,"earnest, elderly horse, rose up, and announced, among other things,"
7056,REGULUS,that he had seen 'signs affixed to Punic deluges.' Half the Form shouted
7057,REGULUS,"for joy, and the other half for joy that there was something to"
7058,REGULUS,shout about.
7059,REGULUS,
7060,REGULUS,Mr. King opened and shut his eyes with great swiftness. '_Signa adfixa
7061,REGULUS,"delubris_,' he gasped. 'So _delubris_ is ""deluges"" is it? Winton, in all"
7062,REGULUS,"our dealings, have I ever suspected you of a jest?'"
7063,REGULUS,
7064,REGULUS,"'No, sir,' said the rigid and angular Winton, while the Form rocked"
7065,REGULUS,about him.
7066,REGULUS,
7067,REGULUS,"'And yet you assert _delubris_ means ""deluges."" Whether I am a fit"
7068,REGULUS,"subject for such a jape is, of course, a matter of opinion, but...."
7069,REGULUS,"Winton, you are normally conscientious. May we assume you looked out"
7070,REGULUS,_delubris_?'
7071,REGULUS,
7072,REGULUS,"'No, sir.' Winton was privileged to speak that truth dangerous to all"
7073,REGULUS,who stand before Kings.
7074,REGULUS,
7075,REGULUS,''Made a shot at it then?'
7076,REGULUS,
7077,REGULUS,Every line of Winton's body showed he had done nothing of the sort.
7078,REGULUS,"Indeed, the very idea that 'Pater' Winton (and a boy is not called"
7079,REGULUS,'Pater' by companions for his frivolity) would make a shot at anything
7080,REGULUS,"was beyond belief. But he replied, 'Yes,' and all the while worked with"
7081,REGULUS,his right heel as though he were heeling a ball at punt-about.
7082,REGULUS,
7083,REGULUS,"Though none dared to boast of being a favourite with King, the taciturn,"
7084,REGULUS,three-cornered Winton stood high in his House-Master's opinion. It
7085,REGULUS,"seemed to save him neither rebuke nor punishment, but the two were in"
7086,REGULUS,some fashion sympathetic.
7087,REGULUS,
7088,REGULUS,"'Hm!' said King drily. 'I was going to say--_Flagito additis damnum_,"
7089,REGULUS,"but I think--I think I see the process. Beetle, the translation of"
7090,REGULUS,"_delubris_, please.'"
7091,REGULUS,
7092,REGULUS,Beetle raised his head from his shaking arm long enough to answer:
7093,REGULUS,"'Ruins, sir.'"
7094,REGULUS,
7095,REGULUS,There was an impressive pause while King checked off crimes on his
7096,REGULUS,fingers. Then to Beetle the much-enduring man addressed winged words:
7097,REGULUS,
7098,REGULUS,"'Guessing,' said he. 'Guessing, Beetle, as usual, from the look of"
7099,REGULUS,"_delubris_ that it bore some relation to _diluvium_ or deluge, you"
7100,REGULUS,imparted the result of your half-baked lucubrations to Winton who seems
7101,REGULUS,"to have been lost enough to have accepted it. Observing next, your"
7102,REGULUS,"companion's fall, from the presumed security of your undistinguished"
7103,REGULUS,"position in the rear-guard, you took another pot-shot. The turbid chaos"
7104,REGULUS,"of your mind threw up some memory of the word ""dilapidations"" which you"
7105,REGULUS,"have pitifully attempted to disguise under the synonym of ""ruins.""'"
7106,REGULUS,
7107,REGULUS,As this was precisely what Beetle had done he looked hurt but forgiving.
7108,REGULUS,"'We will attend to this later,' said King. 'Go on, Winton, and retrieve"
7109,REGULUS,yourself.'
7110,REGULUS,
7111,REGULUS,_Delubris_ happened to be the one word which Winton had not looked out
7112,REGULUS,"and had asked Beetle for, when they were settling into their places. He"
7113,REGULUS,forged ahead with no further trouble. Only when he rendered _scilicet_
7114,REGULUS,"as 'forsooth,' King erupted."
7115,REGULUS,
7116,REGULUS,"'Regulus,' he said, 'was not a leader-writer for the penny press, nor,"
7117,REGULUS,"for that matter, was Horace. Regulus says: ""The soldier ransomed by gold"
7118,REGULUS,"will come keener for the fight--will he by--by gum!"" _That's_ the"
7119,REGULUS,meaning of _scilicet_. It indicates contempt--bitter contempt.
7120,REGULUS,"""Forsooth,"" forsooth! You'll be talking about ""speckled beauties"" and"
7121,REGULUS,"""eventually transpire"" next. Howell, what do you make of that doubled"
7122,REGULUS,"""Vidi ego--ego vidi""? It wasn't put in to fill up the metre, you know.'"
7123,REGULUS,
7124,REGULUS,"'Isn't it intensive, sir?' said Howell, afflicted by a genuine interest"
7125,REGULUS,in what he read. 'Regulus was a bit in earnest about Rome making no
7126,REGULUS,"terms with Carthage--and he wanted to let the Romans understand it,"
7127,REGULUS,"didn't he, sir?'"
7128,REGULUS,
7129,REGULUS,"'Less than your usual grace, but the fact. Regulus _was_ in earnest. He"
7130,REGULUS,was also engaged at the same time in cutting his own throat with every
7131,REGULUS,word he uttered. He knew Carthage which (your examiners won't ask you
7132,REGULUS,this so you needn't take notes) was a sort of God-forsaken nigger
7133,REGULUS,Manchester. Regulus was not thinking about his own life. He was telling
7134,REGULUS,Rome the truth. He was playing for his side. Those lines from the
7135,REGULUS,eighteenth to the fortieth ought to be written in blood. Yet there are
7136,REGULUS,things in human garments which will tell you that Horace was a
7137,REGULUS,flÃ¢neur--a man about town. Avoid such beings. Horace knew a very great
7138,REGULUS,"deal. _He_ knew! _Erit ille fortis_--""will he be brave who once to"
7139,REGULUS,"faithless foes has knelt?"" And again (stop pawing with your hooves,"
7140,REGULUS,Thornton!) _hic unde vitam sumeret inscius_. That means roughly--but I
7141,REGULUS,"perceive I am ahead of my translators. Begin at _hic unde_, Vernon, and"
7142,REGULUS,let us see if you have the spirit of Regulus.'
7143,REGULUS,
7144,REGULUS,"Now no one expected fireworks from gentle Paddy Vernon, sub-prefect of"
7145,REGULUS,"Hartopp's House, but, as must often be the case with growing boys, his"
7146,REGULUS,"mind was in abeyance for the time being, and he said, all in a rush, on"
7147,REGULUS,"behalf of Regulus: '_O magna Carthago probrosis altior Italiae ruinis_,"
7148,REGULUS,"O Carthage, thou wilt stand forth higher than the ruins of Italy.'"
7149,REGULUS,
7150,REGULUS,"Even Beetle, most lenient of critics, was interested at this point,"
7151,REGULUS,though he did not join the half-groan of reprobation from the wiser
7152,REGULUS,heads of the Form.
7153,REGULUS,
7154,REGULUS,"'_Please_ don't mind me,' said King, and Vernon very kindly did not. He"
7155,REGULUS,ploughed on thus: 'He (Regulus) is related to have removed from himself
7156,REGULUS,the kiss of the shameful wife and of his small children as less by the
7157,REGULUS,"head, and, being stern, to have placed his virile visage on the ground.'"
7158,REGULUS,
7159,REGULUS,Since King loved 'virile' about as much as he did 'spouse' or 'forsooth'
7160,REGULUS,the Form looked up hopefully. But Jove thundered not.
7161,REGULUS,
7162,REGULUS,"'Until,' Vernon continued, 'he should have confirmed the sliding fathers"
7163,REGULUS,as being the author of counsel never given under an alias.'
7164,REGULUS,
7165,REGULUS,"He stopped, conscious of stillness round him like the dread calm of the"
7166,REGULUS,typhoon's centre. King's opening voice was sweeter than honey.
7167,REGULUS,
7168,REGULUS,'I am painfully aware by bitter experience that I cannot give you any
7169,REGULUS,"idea of the passion, the power, the--the essential guts of the lines"
7170,REGULUS,which you have so foully outraged in our presence. But--' the note
7171,REGULUS,"changed, 'so far as in me lies, I will strive to bring home to you,"
7172,REGULUS,"Vernon, the fact that there exist in Latin a few pitiful rules of"
7173,REGULUS,"grammar, of syntax, nay, even of declension, which were not created for"
7174,REGULUS,"your incult sport--your Boeotian diversion. You will, therefore, Vernon,"
7175,REGULUS,write out and bring to me to-morrow a word-for-word English-Latin
7176,REGULUS,"translation of the Ode, together with a full list of all adjectives--an"
7177,REGULUS,"adjective is not a verb, Vernon, as the Lower Third will tell you--all"
7178,REGULUS,"adjectives, their number, case, and gender. Even now I haven't begun to"
7179,REGULUS,deal with you faithfully.'
7180,REGULUS,
7181,REGULUS,"'I--I'm very sorry, sir,' Vernon stammered."
7182,REGULUS,
7183,REGULUS,"'You mistake the symptoms, Vernon. You are possibly discomfited by the"
7184,REGULUS,"imposition, but sorrow postulates some sort of mind, intellect, _nous_."
7185,REGULUS,Your rendering of _probrosis_ alone stamps you as lower than the beasts
7186,REGULUS,of the field. Will some one take the taste out of our mouths?
7187,REGULUS,And--talking of tastes--' He coughed. There was a distinct flavour of
7188,REGULUS,"chlorine gas in the air. Up went an eyebrow, though King knew perfectly"
7189,REGULUS,well what it meant.
7190,REGULUS,
7191,REGULUS,"'Mr. Hartopp's st--science class next door,' said Malpass."
7192,REGULUS,
7193,REGULUS,"'Oh yes. I had forgotten. Our newly established Modern Side, of course."
7194,REGULUS,"Perowne, open the windows; and Winton, go on once more from _interque"
7195,REGULUS,maerentes_.'
7196,REGULUS,
7197,REGULUS,"'And hastened away,' said Winton, 'surrounded by his mourning friends,"
7198,REGULUS,"into--into illustrious banishment. But I got that out of Conington,"
7199,REGULUS,"sir,' he added in one conscientious breath."
7200,REGULUS,
7201,REGULUS,"'I am aware. The master generally knows his ass's crib, though I acquit"
7202,REGULUS,_you_ of any intention that way. Can you suggest anything for _egregius
7203,REGULUS,"exul_? Only ""egregious exile""? I fear ""egregious"" is a good word ruined."
7204,REGULUS,No! You can't in this case improve on Conington. Now then for _atqui
7205,REGULUS,sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor pararet_. The whole force of it lies
7206,REGULUS,in the _atqui_.'
7207,REGULUS,
7208,REGULUS,"'Although he knew,' Winton suggested."
7209,REGULUS,
7210,REGULUS,"'Stronger than that, I think.'"
7211,REGULUS,
7212,REGULUS,"'He who knew well,' Malpass interpolated."
7213,REGULUS,
7214,REGULUS,"'Ye-es. ""Well though he knew."" I don't like Conington's ""well-witting."""
7215,REGULUS,It's Wardour Street.'
7216,REGULUS,
7217,REGULUS,'Well though he knew what the savage torturer was--was getting ready for
7218,REGULUS,"him,' said Winton."
7219,REGULUS,
7220,REGULUS,'Ye-es. Had in store for him.'
7221,REGULUS,
7222,REGULUS,'Yet he brushed aside his kinsmen and the people delaying his return.'
7223,REGULUS,
7224,REGULUS,'Ye-es; but then how do you render _obstantes_?'
7225,REGULUS,
7226,REGULUS,'If it's a free translation mightn't _obstantes_ and _morantem_ come to
7227,REGULUS,"about the same thing, sir?'"
7228,REGULUS,
7229,REGULUS,"'Nothing comes to ""about the same thing"" with Horace, Winton. As I have"
7230,REGULUS,"said, Horace was not a journalist. No, I take it that his kinsmen bodily"
7231,REGULUS,"withstood his departure, whereas the crowd--_populumque_--the democracy"
7232,REGULUS,stood about futilely pitying him and getting in the way. Now for that
7233,REGULUS,"noblest of endings--_quam si clientum_,' and King ran off into the"
7234,REGULUS,quotation:
7235,REGULUS,
7236,REGULUS,'As though some tedious business o'er
7237,REGULUS,"Of clients' court, his journey lay"
7238,REGULUS,Towards Venafrum's grassy floor
7239,REGULUS,Or Sparta-built Tarentum's bay.
7240,REGULUS,
7241,REGULUS,"All right, Winton. Beetle, when you've quite finished dodging the fresh"
7242,REGULUS,"air yonder, give me the meaning of _tendens_--and turn down"
7243,REGULUS,your collar.'
7244,REGULUS,
7245,REGULUS,"'Me, sir? _Tendens_, sir? Oh! Stretching away in the direction of, sir.'"
7246,REGULUS,
7247,REGULUS,"'Idiot! Regulus was not a feature of the landscape. He was a man,"
7248,REGULUS,"self-doomed to death by torture. _Atqui, sciebat_--knowing it--having"
7249,REGULUS,achieved it for his country's sake--can't you hear that _atqui_ cut like
7250,REGULUS,a knife?--he moved off with some dignity. That is why Horace out of the
7251,REGULUS,"whole golden Latin tongue chose the one word ""tendens""--which is utterly"
7252,REGULUS,untranslatable.'
7253,REGULUS,
7254,REGULUS,"The gross injustice of being asked to translate it, converted Beetle"
7255,REGULUS,"into a young Christian martyr, till King buried his nose in his"
7256,REGULUS,handkerchief again.
7257,REGULUS,
7258,REGULUS,"'I think they've broken another gas-bottle next door, sir,' said Howell."
7259,REGULUS,'They're always doing it.' The Form coughed as more chlorine came in.
7260,REGULUS,
7261,REGULUS,"'Well, I suppose we must be patient with the Modern Side,' said King."
7262,REGULUS,"'But it is almost insupportable for this Side. Vernon, what are you"
7263,REGULUS,grinning at?'
7264,REGULUS,
7265,REGULUS,Vernon's mind had returned to him glowing and inspired. He chuckled as
7266,REGULUS,he underlined his Horace.
7267,REGULUS,
7268,REGULUS,"'It appears to amuse you,' said King. 'Let us participate. What is it?'"
7269,REGULUS,
7270,REGULUS,"'The last two lines of the Tenth Ode, in this book, sir,' was Vernon's"
7271,REGULUS,amazing reply.
7272,REGULUS,
7273,REGULUS,"'What? Oh, I see. _Non hoc semper erit liminis aut aquae caelestis"
7274,REGULUS,patiens latus_[2].' King's mouth twitched to hide a grin. 'Was that
7275,REGULUS,done with intention?'
7276,REGULUS,
7277,REGULUS,[Footnote 2: 'This side will not always be patient of rain and waiting
7278,REGULUS,on the threshold.']
7279,REGULUS,
7280,REGULUS,"'I--I thought it fitted, sir.'"
7281,REGULUS,
7282,REGULUS,"'It does. It's distinctly happy. What put it into your thick head,"
7283,REGULUS,Paddy?'
7284,REGULUS,
7285,REGULUS,"'I don't know, sir, except we did the Ode last term.'"
7286,REGULUS,
7287,REGULUS,'And you remembered? The same head that minted _probrosis_ as a verb!
7288,REGULUS,"Vernon, you are an enigma. No! This Side will _not_ always be patient of"
7289,REGULUS,unheavenly gases and waters. I will make representations to our
7290,REGULUS,so-called Moderns. Meantime (who shall say I am not just?) I remit you
7291,REGULUS,"your accrued pains and penalties in regard to _probrosim, probrosis,"
7292,REGULUS,"probrosit_ and other enormities. I oughtn't to do it, but this Side is"
7293,REGULUS,"occasionally human. By no means bad, Paddy.'"
7294,REGULUS,
7295,REGULUS,"'Thank you, sir,' said Vernon, wondering how inspiration had visited"
7296,REGULUS,him.
7297,REGULUS,
7298,REGULUS,"Then King, with a few brisk remarks about Science, headed them back to"
7299,REGULUS,"Regulus, of whom and of Horace and Rome and evil-minded commercial"
7300,REGULUS,"Carthage and of the democracy eternally futile, he explained, in all"
7301,REGULUS,"ages and climes, he spoke for ten minutes; passing thence to the next"
7302,REGULUS,"Ode--_Delicta Majorum_--where he fetched up, full-voiced, upon--'_Dis te"
7303,REGULUS,minorem quod geris imperas_' (Thou rulest because thou bearest thyself
7304,REGULUS,"as lower than the Gods)--making it a text for a discourse on manners,"
7305,REGULUS,"morals, and respect for authority as distinct from bottled gases, which"
7306,REGULUS,"lasted till the bell rang. Then Beetle, concertinaing his books,"
7307,REGULUS,"observed to Winton, 'When King's really on tap he's an interestin' dog."
7308,REGULUS,Hartopp's chlorine uncorked him.'
7309,REGULUS,
7310,REGULUS,"'Yes; but why did you tell me _delubris_ was ""deluges,"" you silly ass?'"
7311,REGULUS,said Winton.
7312,REGULUS,
7313,REGULUS,"'Well, that uncorked him too. Look out, you hoof-handed old owl!' Winton"
7314,REGULUS,had cleared for action as the Form poured out like puppies at play and
7315,REGULUS,was scragging Beetle. Stalky from behind collared Winton low. The three
7316,REGULUS,fell in confusion.
7317,REGULUS,
7318,REGULUS,"'_Dis te minorem quod geris imperas_,' quoth Stalky, ruffling Winton's"
7319,REGULUS,lint-white locks. 'Mustn't jape with Number Five study. Don't be too
7320,REGULUS,virtuous. Don't brood over it. 'Twon't count against you in your future
7321,REGULUS,"caree-ah. Cheer up, Pater.'"
7322,REGULUS,
7323,REGULUS,"'Pull him off my--er--essential guts, will you?' said Beetle from"
7324,REGULUS,beneath. 'He's squashin' 'em.'
7325,REGULUS,
7326,REGULUS,They dispersed to their studies.
7327,REGULUS,
7328,REGULUS,*       *       *       *       *
7329,REGULUS,
7330,REGULUS,"No one, the owner least of all, can explain what is in a growing boy's"
7331,REGULUS,mind. It might have been the blind ferment of adolescence; Stalky's
7332,REGULUS,random remarks about virtue might have stirred him; like his betters he
7333,REGULUS,"might have sought popularity by way of clowning; or, as the Head"
7334,REGULUS,"asserted years later, the only known jest of his serious life might have"
7335,REGULUS,"worked on him, as a sober-sided man's one love colours and dislocates"
7336,REGULUS,"all his after days. But, at the next lesson, mechanical drawing with Mr."
7337,REGULUS,"Lidgett who as drawing-master had very limited powers of punishment,"
7338,REGULUS,Winton fell suddenly from grace and let loose a live mouse in the
7339,REGULUS,"form-room. The whole form, shrieking and leaping high, threw at it all"
7340,REGULUS,"the plaster cones, pyramids, and fruit in high relief--not to mention"
7341,REGULUS,ink-pots--that they could lay hands on. Mr. Lidgett reported at once to
7342,REGULUS,"the Head; Winton owned up to his crime, which, venial in the Upper"
7343,REGULUS,"Third, pardonable at a price in the Lower Fourth, was, of course, rank"
7344,REGULUS,"ruffianism on the part of a Fifth Form boy; and so, by graduated stages,"
7345,REGULUS,"he arrived at the Head's study just before lunch, penitent, perturbed,"
7346,REGULUS,annoyed with himself and--as the Head said to King in the corridor after
7347,REGULUS,the meal--more human than he had known him in seven years.
7348,REGULUS,
7349,REGULUS,"'You see,' the Head drawled on, 'Winton's only fault is a certain"
7350,REGULUS,costive and unaccommodating virtue. So this comes very happily.'
7351,REGULUS,
7352,REGULUS,"'I've never noticed any sign of it,' said King. Winton was in King's"
7353,REGULUS,"House, and though King as pro-consul might, and did, infernally oppress"
7354,REGULUS,"his own Province, once a black and yellow cap was in trouble at the"
7355,REGULUS,hands of the Imperial authority King fought for him to the very last
7356,REGULUS,steps of Caesar's throne.
7357,REGULUS,
7358,REGULUS,"'Well, you yourself admitted just now that a mouse was beneath the"
7359,REGULUS,"occasion,' the Head answered."
7360,REGULUS,
7361,REGULUS,'It was.' Mr. King did not love Mr. Lidgett. 'It should have been a rat.
7362,REGULUS,But--but--I hate to plead it--it's the lad's first offence.'
7363,REGULUS,
7364,REGULUS,"'Could you have damned him more completely, King?'"
7365,REGULUS,
7366,REGULUS,"'Hm. What is the penalty?' said King, in retreat, but keeping up a"
7367,REGULUS,rear-guard action.
7368,REGULUS,
7369,REGULUS,'Only my usual few lines of Virgil to be shown up by tea-time.'
7370,REGULUS,
7371,REGULUS,The Head's eyes turned slightly to that end of the corridor where
7372,REGULUS,"Mullins, Captain of the Games ('Pot,' 'old Pot,' or 'Potiphar' Mullins),"
7373,REGULUS,"was pinning up the usual Wednesday notice--'Big, Middle, and Little Side"
7374,REGULUS,"Football--A to K, L to Z, 3 to 4.45 P.M.'"
7375,REGULUS,
7376,REGULUS,You cannot write out the Head's usual few (which means five hundred)
7377,REGULUS,Latin lines and play football for one hour and three-quarters between
7378,REGULUS,the hours of 1.30 and 5 P.M. Winton had evidently no intention of trying
7379,REGULUS,"to do so, for he hung about the corridor with a set face and an uneasy"
7380,REGULUS,"foot. Yet it was law in the school, compared with which that of the"
7381,REGULUS,"Medes and Persians was no more than a non-committal resolution, that any"
7382,REGULUS,"boy, outside the First Fifteen, who missed his football for any reason"
7383,REGULUS,"whatever, and had not a written excuse, duly signed by competent"
7384,REGULUS,"authority to explain his absence, would receive not less than three"
7385,REGULUS,"strokes with a ground-ash from the Captain of the Games, generally a"
7386,REGULUS,"youth between seventeen and eighteen years, rarely under eleven stone"
7387,REGULUS,"('Pot' was nearer thirteen), and always in hard condition."
7388,REGULUS,
7389,REGULUS,King knew without inquiry that the Head had given Winton no such excuse.
7390,REGULUS,
7391,REGULUS,'But he is practically a member of the First Fifteen. He has played for
7392,REGULUS,"it all this term,' said King. 'I believe his Cap should have arrived"
7393,REGULUS,last week.'
7394,REGULUS,
7395,REGULUS,"'His Cap has not been given him. Officially, therefore, he is naught. I"
7396,REGULUS,rely on old Pot.'
7397,REGULUS,
7398,REGULUS,"'But Mullins is Winton's study-mate,' King persisted."
7399,REGULUS,
7400,REGULUS,Pot Mullins and Pater Winton were cousins and rather close friends.
7401,REGULUS,
7402,REGULUS,"'That will make no difference to Mullins--or Winton, if I know 'em,'"
7403,REGULUS,said the Head.
7404,REGULUS,
7405,REGULUS,"'But--but,' King played his last card desperately, 'I was going to"
7406,REGULUS,"recommend Winton for extra sub-prefect in my House, now Carton"
7407,REGULUS,has gone.'
7408,REGULUS,
7409,REGULUS,"'Certainly,' said the Head. 'Why not? He will be excellent by tea-time,"
7410,REGULUS,I hope.'
7411,REGULUS,
7412,REGULUS,"At that moment they saw Mr. Lidgett, tripping down the corridor, waylaid"
7413,REGULUS,by Winton.
7414,REGULUS,
7415,REGULUS,"'It's about that mouse-business at mechanical drawing,' Winton opened,"
7416,REGULUS,swinging across his path.
7417,REGULUS,
7418,REGULUS,"'Yes, yes, highly disgraceful,' Mr. Lidgett panted."
7419,REGULUS,
7420,REGULUS,"'I know it was,' said Winton. 'It--it was a cad's trick because--'"
7421,REGULUS,
7422,REGULUS,"'Because you knew I couldn't give you more than fifty lines,' said Mr."
7423,REGULUS,Lidgett.
7424,REGULUS,
7425,REGULUS,"'Well, anyhow I've come to apologise for it.'"
7426,REGULUS,
7427,REGULUS,"'Certainly,' said Mr. Lidgett, and added, for he was a kindly man, 'I"
7428,REGULUS,think that shows quite right feeling. I'll tell the Head at once I'm
7429,REGULUS,satisfied.'
7430,REGULUS,
7431,REGULUS,'No--no!' The boy's still unmended voice jumped from the growl to the
7432,REGULUS,squeak. 'I didn't mean _that_! I--I did it on principle. Please
7433,REGULUS,don't--er--do anything of that kind.'
7434,REGULUS,
7435,REGULUS,"Mr. Lidgett looked him up and down and, being an artist, understood."
7436,REGULUS,
7437,REGULUS,"'Thank you, Winton,' he said. 'This shall be between ourselves.'"
7438,REGULUS,
7439,REGULUS,"'You heard?' said King, indecent pride in his voice."
7440,REGULUS,
7441,REGULUS,'Of course. You thought he was going to get Lidgett to beg him off the
7442,REGULUS,impot.'
7443,REGULUS,
7444,REGULUS,King denied this with so much warmth that the Head laughed and King went
7445,REGULUS,away in a huff.
7446,REGULUS,
7447,REGULUS,"'By the way,' said the Head, 'I've told Winton to do his lines in your"
7448,REGULUS,form-room--not in his study.'
7449,REGULUS,
7450,REGULUS,"'Thanks,' said King over his shoulder, for the Head's orders had saved"
7451,REGULUS,"Winton and Mullins, who was doing extra Army work in the study, from an"
7452,REGULUS,embarrassing afternoon together.
7453,REGULUS,
7454,REGULUS,"An hour later, King wandered into his still form-room as though by"
7455,REGULUS,accident. Winton was hard at work.
7456,REGULUS,
7457,REGULUS,"'Aha!' said King, rubbing his hands. 'This does not look like games,"
7458,REGULUS,Winton. Don't let me arrest your facile pen. Whence this sudden love
7459,REGULUS,for Virgil?'
7460,REGULUS,
7461,REGULUS,"'Impot from the Head, sir, for that mouse-business this morning.'"
7462,REGULUS,
7463,REGULUS,'Rumours thereof have reached us. That was a lapse on your part into
7464,REGULUS,Lower Thirdery which I don't quite understand.'
7465,REGULUS,
7466,REGULUS,The 'tump-tump' of the puntabouts before the sides settled to games came
7467,REGULUS,"through the open window. Winton, like his House-Master, loved fresh air."
7468,REGULUS,"Then they heard Paddy Vernon, sub-prefect on duty, calling the roll in"
7469,REGULUS,the field and marking defaulters. Winton wrote steadily. King curled
7470,REGULUS,"himself up on a desk, hands round knees. One would have said that the"
7471,REGULUS,"man was gloating over the boy's misfortune, but the boy understood."
7472,REGULUS,
7473,REGULUS,"'_Dis te minorem quod geris imperas_,' King quoted presently. 'It is"
7474,REGULUS,necessary to bear oneself as lower than the local gods--even than
7475,REGULUS,drawing-masters who are precluded from effective retaliation. I _do_
7476,REGULUS,"wish you'd tried that mouse-game with me, Pater.'"
7477,REGULUS,
7478,REGULUS,"Winton grinned; then sobered 'It was a cad's trick, sir, to play on Mr."
7479,REGULUS,Lidgett.' He peered forward at the page he was copying.
7480,REGULUS,
7481,REGULUS,"'Well, ""the sin _I_ impute to each frustrate ghost""--' King stopped"
7482,REGULUS,himself. 'Why do you goggle like an owl? Hand me the Mantuan and I'll
7483,REGULUS,dictate. No matter. Any rich Virgilian measures will serve. I may
7484,REGULUS,peradventure recall a few.' He began:
7485,REGULUS,
7486,REGULUS,'Tu regere imperio populos Romane memento
7487,REGULUS,"Hae tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem,"
7488,REGULUS,Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos.
7489,REGULUS,
7490,REGULUS,"There you have it all, Winton. Write that out twice and yet once again.'"
7491,REGULUS,
7492,REGULUS,"For the next forty minutes, with never a glance at the book, King paid"
7493,REGULUS,out the glorious hexameters (and King could read Latin as though it were
7494,REGULUS,"alive), Winton hauling them in and coiling them away behind him as"
7495,REGULUS,trimmers in a telegraph-ship's hold coil away deep-sea cable. King broke
7496,REGULUS,"from the Aeneid to the Georgics and back again, pausing now and then to"
7497,REGULUS,translate some specially loved line or to dwell on the treble-shot
7498,REGULUS,texture of the ancient fabric. He did not allude to the coming interview
7499,REGULUS,"with Mullins except at the last, when he said, 'I think at this"
7500,REGULUS,"juncture, Pater, I need not ask you for the precise significance of"
7501,REGULUS,_atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus tortor_.'
7502,REGULUS,
7503,REGULUS,"The ungrateful Winton flushed angrily, and King loafed out to take five"
7504,REGULUS,"o'clock call-over, after which he invited little Hartopp to tea and a"
7505,REGULUS,"talk on chlorine-gas. Hartopp accepted the challenge like a bantam, and"
7506,REGULUS,the two went up to King's study about the same time as Winton returned
7507,REGULUS,to the form-room beneath it to finish his lines.
7508,REGULUS,
7509,REGULUS,"Then half a dozen of the Second Fifteen, who should have been washing,"
7510,REGULUS,"strolled in to condole with 'Pater' Winton, whose misfortune and its"
7511,REGULUS,"consequences were common talk. No one was more sincere than the long,"
7512,REGULUS,"red-headed, knotty-knuckled 'Paddy' Vernon, but, being a careless"
7513,REGULUS,"animal, he joggled Winton's desk."
7514,REGULUS,
7515,REGULUS,'Curse you for a silly ass!' said Winton. 'Don't do that.'
7516,REGULUS,
7517,REGULUS,"No one is expected to be polite while under punishment, so Vernon,"
7518,REGULUS,"sinking his sub-prefectship, replied peacefully enough:"
7519,REGULUS,
7520,REGULUS,"'Well, don't be wrathy, Pater.'"
7521,REGULUS,
7522,REGULUS,"'I'm not,' said Winton. 'Get out! This ain't your House form-room.'"
7523,REGULUS,
7524,REGULUS,''Form-room don't belong to you. Why don't you go to your own study?'
7525,REGULUS,Vernon replied.
7526,REGULUS,
7527,REGULUS,"'Because Mullins is there waitin' for the victim,' said Stalky"
7528,REGULUS,"delicately, and they all laughed. 'You ought to have shaken that mouse"
7529,REGULUS,"out of your trouser-leg, Pater. That's the way _I_ did in my youth."
7530,REGULUS,"Pater's revertin' to his second childhood. Never mind, Pater, we all"
7531,REGULUS,respect you and your future caree-ah.'
7532,REGULUS,
7533,REGULUS,"Winton, still writhing, growled. Vernon leaning on the desk somehow"
7534,REGULUS,shook it again. Then he laughed.
7535,REGULUS,
7536,REGULUS,'What are you grinning at?' Winton asked.
7537,REGULUS,
7538,REGULUS,'I was only thinkin' of _you_ being sent up to take a lickin' from Pot.
7539,REGULUS,I swear I don't think it's fair. You've never shirked a game in your
7540,REGULUS,"life, and you're as good as in the First Fifteen already. Your Cap ought"
7541,REGULUS,"to have been delivered last week, oughtn't it?'"
7542,REGULUS,
7543,REGULUS,It was law in the school that no man could by any means enjoy the
7544,REGULUS,privileges and immunities of the First Fifteen till the black velvet cap
7545,REGULUS,"with the gold tassel, made by dilatory Exeter outfitters, had been"
7546,REGULUS,"actually set on his head. Ages ago, a large-built and unruly Second"
7547,REGULUS,"Fifteen had attempted to change this law, but the prefects of that age"
7548,REGULUS,"were still larger, and the lively experiment had never been repeated."
7549,REGULUS,
7550,REGULUS,"'Will you,' said Winton very slowly, 'kindly mind your own damned"
7551,REGULUS,"business, you cursed, clumsy, fat-headed fool?'"
7552,REGULUS,
7553,REGULUS,The form-room was as silent as the empty field in the darkness outside.
7554,REGULUS,Vernon shifted his feet uneasily.
7555,REGULUS,
7556,REGULUS,"'Well, _I_ shouldn't like to take a lickin' from Pot,' he said."
7557,REGULUS,
7558,REGULUS,"'Wouldn't you?' Winton asked, as he paged the sheets of lines with hands"
7559,REGULUS,that shook.
7560,REGULUS,
7561,REGULUS,"'No, I shouldn't,' said Vernon, his freckles growing more distinct on"
7562,REGULUS,the bridge of his white nose.
7563,REGULUS,
7564,REGULUS,"'Well, I'm going to take it'--Winton moved clear of the desk as he"
7565,REGULUS,spoke. 'But _you're_ going to take a lickin' from me first.' Before any
7566,REGULUS,"one realised it, he had flung himself neighing against Vernon. No"
7567,REGULUS,"decencies were observed on either side, and the rest looked on amazed."
7568,REGULUS,"The two met confusedly, Vernon trying to do what he could with his"
7569,REGULUS,"longer reach; Winton, insensible to blows, only concerned to drive his"
7570,REGULUS,enemy into a corner and batter him to pulp. This he managed over against
7571,REGULUS,"the fire-place, where Vernon dropped half-stunned. 'Now I'm going to"
7572,REGULUS,"give you your lickin',' said Winton. 'Lie there till I get a ground-ash"
7573,REGULUS,"and I'll cut you to pieces. If you move, I'll chuck you out of the"
7574,REGULUS,"window.' He wound his hands into the boy's collar and waistband, and had"
7575,REGULUS,actually heaved him half off the ground before the others with one
7576,REGULUS,"accord dropped on his head, shoulders, and legs. He fought them crazily"
7577,REGULUS,in an awful hissing silence. Stalky's sensitive nose was rubbed along
7578,REGULUS,the floor; Beetle received a jolt in the wind that sent him whistling
7579,REGULUS,"and crowing against the wall; Perowne's forehead was cut, and Malpass"
7580,REGULUS,came out with an eye that explained itself like a dying rainbow through
7581,REGULUS,a whole week.
7582,REGULUS,
7583,REGULUS,"'Mad! Quite mad!' said Stalky, and for the third time wriggled back to"
7584,REGULUS,"Winton's throat. The door opened and King came in, Hartopp's little"
7585,REGULUS,figure just behind him. The mound on the floor panted and heaved but did
7586,REGULUS,"not rise, for Winton still squirmed vengefully. 'Only a little play,"
7587,REGULUS,"sir,' said Perowne. ''Only hit my head against a form.' This was"
7588,REGULUS,quite true.
7589,REGULUS,
7590,REGULUS,"'Oh,' said King. '_Dimovit obstantes propinquos._ You, I presume, are"
7591,REGULUS,"the _populus_ delaying Winton's return to--Mullins, eh?'"
7592,REGULUS,
7593,REGULUS,"'No, sir,' said Stalky behind his claret-coloured handkerchief. 'We're"
7594,REGULUS,the _maerentes amicos_.'
7595,REGULUS,
7596,REGULUS,"'Not bad! You see, some of it sticks after all,' King chuckled to"
7597,REGULUS,"Hartopp, and the two masters left without further inquiries."
7598,REGULUS,
7599,REGULUS,The boys sat still on the now-passive Winton.
7600,REGULUS,
7601,REGULUS,"'Well,' said Stalky at last, 'of all the putrid he-asses, Pater, you are"
7602,REGULUS,_the_--'
7603,REGULUS,
7604,REGULUS,"'I'm sorry. I'm awfully sorry,' Winton began, and they let him rise. He"
7605,REGULUS,"held out his hand to the bruised and bewildered Vernon. 'Sorry, Paddy."
7606,REGULUS,I--I must have lost my temper. I--I don't know what's the matter
7607,REGULUS,with me.'
7608,REGULUS,
7609,REGULUS,"''Fat lot of good that'll do my face at tea,' Vernon grunted. 'Why"
7610,REGULUS,couldn't you say there was something wrong with you instead of lamming
7611,REGULUS,out like a lunatic? Is my lip puffy?'
7612,REGULUS,
7613,REGULUS,"'Just a trifle. Look at my beak! Well, we got all these pretty marks at"
7614,REGULUS,"footer--owin' to the zeal with which we played the game,' said Stalky,"
7615,REGULUS,"dusting himself. 'But d'you think you're fit to be let loose again,"
7616,REGULUS,Pater? 'Sure you don't want to kill another sub-prefect? I wish _I_ was
7617,REGULUS,Pot. I'd cut your sprightly young soul out.'
7618,REGULUS,
7619,REGULUS,"'I s'pose I ought to go to Pot now,' said Winton."
7620,REGULUS,
7621,REGULUS,'And let all the other asses see you lookin' like this! Not much. We'll
7622,REGULUS,"all come up to Number Five Study and wash off in hot water. Beetle, you"
7623,REGULUS,aren't damaged. Go along and light the gas-stove.'
7624,REGULUS,
7625,REGULUS,"'There's a tin of cocoa in my study somewhere,' Perowne shouted after"
7626,REGULUS,"him. 'Rootle round till you find it, and take it up.'"
7627,REGULUS,
7628,REGULUS,"Separately, by different roads, Vernon's jersey pulled half over his"
7629,REGULUS,"head, the boys repaired to Number Five Study. Little Hartopp and King, I"
7630,REGULUS,"am sorry to say, leaned over the banisters of King's landing"
7631,REGULUS,and watched.
7632,REGULUS,
7633,REGULUS,"'Ve-ry human,' said little Hartopp. 'Your virtuous Winton, having got"
7634,REGULUS,"himself into trouble, takes it out of my poor old Paddy. I wonder what"
7635,REGULUS,precise lie Paddy will tell about his face.'
7636,REGULUS,
7637,REGULUS,'But surely you aren't going to embarrass him by asking?' said King.
7638,REGULUS,
7639,REGULUS,"'_Your_ boy won,' said Hartopp."
7640,REGULUS,
7641,REGULUS,"'To go back to what we were discussing,' said King quickly, 'do you"
7642,REGULUS,pretend that your modern system of inculcating unrelated facts about
7643,REGULUS,"chlorine, for instance, all of which may be proved fallacies by the time"
7644,REGULUS,"the boys grow up, can have any real bearing on education--even the low"
7645,REGULUS,type of it that examiners expect?'
7646,REGULUS,
7647,REGULUS,'I maintain nothing. But is it any worse than your Chinese reiteration
7648,REGULUS,of uncomprehended syllables in a dead tongue?'
7649,REGULUS,
7650,REGULUS,"'Dead, forsooth!' King fairly danced. 'The only living tongue on earth!"
7651,REGULUS,"Chinese! On my word, Hartopp!'"
7652,REGULUS,
7653,REGULUS,'And at the end of seven years--how often have I said it?' Hartopp went
7654,REGULUS,"on,--'seven years of two hundred and twenty days of six hours each, your"
7655,REGULUS,"victims go away with nothing, absolutely nothing, except, perhaps, if"
7656,REGULUS,"they've been very attentive, a dozen--no, I'll grant you twenty--one"
7657,REGULUS,score of totally unrelated Latin tags which any child of twelve could
7658,REGULUS,have absorbed in two terms.'
7659,REGULUS,
7660,REGULUS,'But--but can't you realise that if our system brings later--at any
7661,REGULUS,rate--at a pinch--a simple understanding--grammar and Latinity apart--a
7662,REGULUS,"mere glimpse of the significance (foul word!) of, we'll say, one Ode of"
7663,REGULUS,"Horace, one twenty lines of Virgil, we've got what we poor devils of"
7664,REGULUS,ushers are striving after?'
7665,REGULUS,
7666,REGULUS,'And what might that be?' said Hartopp.
7667,REGULUS,
7668,REGULUS,"'Balance, proportion, perspective--life. Your scientific man is the"
7669,REGULUS,unrelated animal--the beast without background. Haven't you ever
7670,REGULUS,realised _that_ in your atmosphere of stinks?'
7671,REGULUS,
7672,REGULUS,"'Meantime you make them lose life for the sake of living, eh?'"
7673,REGULUS,
7674,REGULUS,"'Blind again, Hartopp! I told you about Paddy's quotation this morning."
7675,REGULUS,"(But he made _probrosis_ a verb, he did!) You yourself heard young"
7676,REGULUS,Corkran's reference to _maerentes amicos_. It sticks--a little of it
7677,REGULUS,sticks among the barbarians.'
7678,REGULUS,
7679,REGULUS,"'Absolutely and essentially Chinese,' said little Hartopp, who, alone of"
7680,REGULUS,"the common-room, refused to be outfaced by King. 'But I don't yet"
7681,REGULUS,understand how Paddy came to be licked by Winton. Paddy's supposed to be
7682,REGULUS,something of a boxer.'
7683,REGULUS,
7684,REGULUS,"'Beware of vinegar made from honey,' King replied. 'Pater, like some"
7685,REGULUS,"other people, is patient and long-suffering, but he has his limits. The"
7686,REGULUS,"Head is oppressing him damnably, too. As I pointed out, the boy has"
7687,REGULUS,practically been in the First Fifteen since term began.'
7688,REGULUS,
7689,REGULUS,"'But, my dear fellow, I've known you give a boy an impot and refuse him"
7690,REGULUS,"leave off games, again and again.'"
7691,REGULUS,
7692,REGULUS,"'Ah, but that was when there was real need to get at some oaf who"
7693,REGULUS,"couldn't be sensitised in any other way. Now, in our esteemed Head's"
7694,REGULUS,action I see nothing but--'
7695,REGULUS,
7696,REGULUS,The conversation from this point does not concern us.
7697,REGULUS,
7698,REGULUS,"Meantime Winton, very penitent and especially polite towards Vernon, was"
7699,REGULUS,being cheered with cocoa in Number Five Study. They had some difficulty
7700,REGULUS,in stemming the flood of his apologies. He himself pointed out to Vernon
7701,REGULUS,"that he had attacked a sub-prefect for no reason whatever, and,"
7702,REGULUS,"therefore, deserved official punishment."
7703,REGULUS,
7704,REGULUS,"'I can't think what was the matter with me to-day,' he mourned. 'Ever"
7705,REGULUS,since that blasted mouse-business--'
7706,REGULUS,
7707,REGULUS,"'Well, then, don't think,' said Stalky. 'Or do you want Paddy to make a"
7708,REGULUS,row about it before all the school?'
7709,REGULUS,
7710,REGULUS,Here Vernon was understood to say that he would see Winton and all the
7711,REGULUS,school somewhere else.
7712,REGULUS,
7713,REGULUS,'And if you imagine Perowne and Malpass and me are goin' to give
7714,REGULUS,"evidence at a prefects' meeting just to soothe your beastly conscience,"
7715,REGULUS,"you jolly well err,' said Beetle. 'I know what you did.'"
7716,REGULUS,
7717,REGULUS,"'What?' croaked Pater, out of the valley of his humiliation."
7718,REGULUS,
7719,REGULUS,'You went Berserk. I've read all about it in _Hypatia_.'
7720,REGULUS,
7721,REGULUS,"'What's ""going Berserk""?' Winton asked."
7722,REGULUS,
7723,REGULUS,"'Never you mind,' was the reply. 'Now, don't you feel awfully weak and"
7724,REGULUS,seedy?'
7725,REGULUS,
7726,REGULUS,"'I _am_ rather tired,' said Winton, sighing."
7727,REGULUS,
7728,REGULUS,'That's what you ought to be. You've gone Berserk and pretty soon you'll
7729,REGULUS,"go to sleep. But you'll probably be liable to fits of it all your life,'"
7730,REGULUS,Beetle concluded. ''Shouldn't wonder if you murdered some one some day.'
7731,REGULUS,
7732,REGULUS,'Shut up--you and your Berserks!' said Stalky. 'Go to Mullins now and
7733,REGULUS,"get it over, Pater.'"
7734,REGULUS,
7735,REGULUS,"'I call it filthy unjust of the Head,' said Vernon. 'Anyhow, you've"
7736,REGULUS,"given me my lickin', old man. I hope Pot'll give you yours.'"
7737,REGULUS,
7738,REGULUS,"'I'm awfully sorry--awfully sorry,' was Winton's last word."
7739,REGULUS,
7740,REGULUS,It was the custom in that consulship to deal with games' defaulters
7741,REGULUS,"between five o'clock call-over and tea. Mullins, who was old enough to"
7742,REGULUS,"pity, did not believe in letting boys wait through the night till the"
7743,REGULUS,chill of the next morning for their punishments. He was finishing off
7744,REGULUS,the last of the small fry and their excuses when Winton arrived.
7745,REGULUS,
7746,REGULUS,"'But, please, Mullins'--this was Babcock tertius, a dear little"
7747,REGULUS,twelve-year-old mother's darling--'I had an awful hack on the knee. I've
7748,REGULUS,been to the Matron about it and she gave me some iodine. I've been
7749,REGULUS,rubbing it in all day. I thought that would be an excuse off.'
7750,REGULUS,
7751,REGULUS,"'Let's have a look at it,' said the impassive Mullins. 'That's a"
7752,REGULUS,shin-bruise--about a week old. Touch your toes. I'll give you
7753,REGULUS,the iodine.'
7754,REGULUS,
7755,REGULUS,"Babcock yelled loudly as he had many times before. The face of Jevons,"
7756,REGULUS,"aged eleven, a new boy that dark wet term, low in the House, low in the"
7757,REGULUS,"Lower School, and lowest of all in his home-sick little mind turned"
7758,REGULUS,white at the horror of the sight. They could hear his working lips part
7759,REGULUS,stickily as Babcock wailed his way out of hearing.
7760,REGULUS,
7761,REGULUS,"'Hullo, Jevons! What brings you here?' said Mullins."
7762,REGULUS,
7763,REGULUS,"'Pl-ease, sir, I went for a walk with Babcock tertius.'"
7764,REGULUS,
7765,REGULUS,"'Did you? Then I bet you went to the tuck-shop--and you paid, didn't"
7766,REGULUS,you?'
7767,REGULUS,
7768,REGULUS,A nod. Jevons was too terrified to speak.
7769,REGULUS,
7770,REGULUS,"'Of course, and I bet Babcock told you that old Pot 'ud let you off"
7771,REGULUS,because it was the first time.'
7772,REGULUS,
7773,REGULUS,Another nod with a ghost of a smile in it.
7774,REGULUS,
7775,REGULUS,'All right.' Mullins picked Jevons up before he could guess what was
7776,REGULUS,"coming, laid him on the table with one hand, with the other gave him"
7777,REGULUS,"three emphatic spanks, then held him high in air."
7778,REGULUS,
7779,REGULUS,"'Now you tell Babcock tertius that he's got you a licking from me, and"
7780,REGULUS,see you jolly well pay it back to him. And when you're prefect of games
7781,REGULUS,don't you let any one shirk his footer without a written excuse. Where
7782,REGULUS,d'you play in your game?'
7783,REGULUS,
7784,REGULUS,"'Forward, sir.'"
7785,REGULUS,
7786,REGULUS,'You can do better than that. I've seen you run like a young
7787,REGULUS,"buck-rabbit. Ask Dickson from me to try you as three-quarter next game,"
7788,REGULUS,will you? Cut along.'
7789,REGULUS,
7790,REGULUS,"Jevons left, warm for the first time that day, enormously set up in his"
7791,REGULUS,"own esteem, and very hot against the deceitful Babcock."
7792,REGULUS,
7793,REGULUS,"Mullins turned to Winton. 'Your name's on the list, Pater.' Winton"
7794,REGULUS,nodded.
7795,REGULUS,
7796,REGULUS,'I know it. The Head landed me with an impot for that mouse-business at
7797,REGULUS,mechanical drawing. No excuse.'
7798,REGULUS,
7799,REGULUS,'He meant it then?' Mullins jerked his head delicately towards the
7800,REGULUS,ground-ash on the table. 'I heard something about it.'
7801,REGULUS,
7802,REGULUS,"Winton nodded. 'A rotten thing to do,' he said. 'Can't think what I was"
7803,REGULUS,doing ever to do it. It counts against a fellow so; and there's some
7804,REGULUS,more too--'
7805,REGULUS,
7806,REGULUS,"'All right, Pater. Just stand clear of our photo-bracket, will you?'"
7807,REGULUS,
7808,REGULUS,"The little formality over, there was a pause. Winton swung round, yawned"
7809,REGULUS,in Pot's astonished face and staggered towards the window-seat.
7810,REGULUS,
7811,REGULUS,"'What's the matter with you, Dick? Ill?'"
7812,REGULUS,
7813,REGULUS,"'No. Perfectly all right, thanks. Only--only a little sleepy.' Winton"
7814,REGULUS,"stretched himself out, and then and there fell deeply and"
7815,REGULUS,placidly asleep.
7816,REGULUS,
7817,REGULUS,"'It isn't a faint,' said the experienced Mullins, 'or his pulse wouldn't"
7818,REGULUS,"act. 'Tisn't a fit or he'd snort and twitch. It can't be sunstroke, this"
7819,REGULUS,"term, and he hasn't been over-training for anything.' He opened Winton's"
7820,REGULUS,"collar, packed a cushion under his head, threw a rug over him and sat"
7821,REGULUS,"down to listen to the regular breathing. Before long Stalky arrived, on"
7822,REGULUS,pretence of borrowing a book. He looked at the window-seat.
7823,REGULUS,
7824,REGULUS,''Noticed anything wrong with Winton lately?' said Mullins.
7825,REGULUS,
7826,REGULUS,''Notice anything wrong with my beak?' Stalky replied. 'Pater went
7827,REGULUS,"Berserk after call-over, and fell on a lot of us for jesting with him"
7828,REGULUS,about his impot. You ought to see Malpass's eye.'
7829,REGULUS,
7830,REGULUS,'You mean that Pater fought?' said Mullins.
7831,REGULUS,
7832,REGULUS,'Like a devil. Then he nearly went to sleep in our study just now. I
7833,REGULUS,expect he'll be all right when he wakes up. Rummy business!
7834,REGULUS,Conscientious old bargee. You ought to have heard his apologies.'
7835,REGULUS,
7836,REGULUS,"'But Pater can't fight one little bit,' Mullins repeated."
7837,REGULUS,
7838,REGULUS,''Twasn't fighting. He just tried to murder every one.' Stalky described
7839,REGULUS,"the affair, and when he left Mullins went off to take counsel with the"
7840,REGULUS,"Head, who, out of a cloud of blue smoke, told him that all would yet"
7841,REGULUS,be well.
7842,REGULUS,
7843,REGULUS,"'Winton,' said he, 'is a little stiff in his moral joints. He'll get"
7844,REGULUS,over that. If he asks you whether to-day's doings will count against
7845,REGULUS,him in his--'
7846,REGULUS,
7847,REGULUS,"'But you know it's important to him, sir. His people aren't--very well"
7848,REGULUS,"off,' said Mullins."
7849,REGULUS,
7850,REGULUS,"'That's why I'm taking all this trouble. You must reassure him, Pot. I"
7851,REGULUS,"have overcrowded him with new experiences. Oh, by the way, has his"
7852,REGULUS,Cap come?'
7853,REGULUS,
7854,REGULUS,"'It came at dinner, sir.' Mullins laughed."
7855,REGULUS,
7856,REGULUS,"Sure enough, when he waked at tea-time, Winton proposed to take Mullins"
7857,REGULUS,"all through every one of his day's lapses from grace, and 'Do you think"
7858,REGULUS,it will count against me?' said he.
7859,REGULUS,
7860,REGULUS,"'Don't you fuss so much about yourself and your silly career,' said"
7861,REGULUS,Mullins. 'You're all right. And oh--here's your First Cap at last. Shove
7862,REGULUS,it up on the bracket and come on to tea.'
7863,REGULUS,
7864,REGULUS,"They met King on their way, stepping statelily and rubbing his hands. 'I"
7865,REGULUS,"have applied,' said he, 'for the services of an additional sub-prefect"
7866,REGULUS,"in Carton's unlamented absence. Your name, Winton, seems to have found"
7867,REGULUS,"favour with the powers that be, and--and all things considered--I am"
7868,REGULUS,disposed to give my support to the nomination. You are therefore a
7869,REGULUS,quasi-lictor.'
7870,REGULUS,
7871,REGULUS,"'Then it didn't count against me,' Winton gasped as soon as they were"
7872,REGULUS,out of hearing.
7873,REGULUS,
7874,REGULUS,A Captain of Games can jest with a sub-prefect publicly.
7875,REGULUS,
7876,REGULUS,"'You utter ass!' said Mullins, and caught him by the back of his stiff"
7877,REGULUS,"neck and ran him down to the hall where the sub-prefects, who sit below"
7878,REGULUS,"the salt, made him welcome with the economical bloater-paste"
7879,REGULUS,of mid-term.
7880,REGULUS,
7881,REGULUS,King and little Hartopp were sparring in the Reverend John Gillett's
7882,REGULUS,study at 10 P.M.--classical _versus_ modern as usual.
7883,REGULUS,
7884,REGULUS,"'Character--proportion--background,' snarled King. 'That is the essence"
7885,REGULUS,of the Humanities.'
7886,REGULUS,
7887,REGULUS,"'Analects of Confucius,' little Hartopp answered."
7888,REGULUS,
7889,REGULUS,"'Time,' said the Reverend John behind the soda-water. 'You men oppress"
7890,REGULUS,"me. Hartopp, what did you say to Paddy in your dormitories to-night?"
7891,REGULUS,Even _you_ couldn't have overlooked his face.'
7892,REGULUS,
7893,REGULUS,"'But I did,' said Hartopp calmly. 'I wasn't even humorous about it as"
7894,REGULUS,some clerics might have been. I went straight through and said naught.'
7895,REGULUS,
7896,REGULUS,"'Poor Paddy! Now, for my part,' said King, 'and you know I am not lavish"
7897,REGULUS,"in my praises, I consider Winton a first-class type; absolutely"
7898,REGULUS,first-class.'
7899,REGULUS,
7900,REGULUS,"'Ha-ardly,' said the Reverend John. 'First-class of the second class, I"
7901,REGULUS,admit. The very best type of second class but'--he shook his head--'it
7902,REGULUS,should have been a rat. Pater'll never be anything more than a Colonel
7903,REGULUS,of Engineers.'
7904,REGULUS,
7905,REGULUS,'What do you base that verdict on?' said King stiffly.
7906,REGULUS,
7907,REGULUS,'He came to me after prayers--with all his conscience.'
7908,REGULUS,
7909,REGULUS,'Poor old Pater. Was it the mouse?' said little Hartopp.
7910,REGULUS,
7911,REGULUS,"'That, and what he called his uncontrollable temper, and his"
7912,REGULUS,responsibilities as sub-prefect.'
7913,REGULUS,
7914,REGULUS,'And you?'
7915,REGULUS,
7916,REGULUS,'If we had had what is vulgarly called a pi-jaw he'd have had
7917,REGULUS,"hysterics. So I recommended a dose of Epsom salts. He'll take it,"
7918,REGULUS,"too--conscientiously. Don't eat me, King. Perhaps, he'll be a K.C.B.'"
7919,REGULUS,
7920,REGULUS,Ten o'clock struck and the Army class boys in the further studies coming
7921,REGULUS,to their houses after an hour's extra work passed along the gravel path
7922,REGULUS,"below. Some one was chanting, to the tune of 'White sand and grey sand,'"
7923,REGULUS,_Dis te minorem quod geris imperas_. He stopped outside Mullins' study.
7924,REGULUS,They heard Mullins' window slide up and then Stalky's voice:
7925,REGULUS,
7926,REGULUS,"'Ah! Good-evening, Mullins, my _barbarus tortor_. We're the waits. We"
7927,REGULUS,have come to inquire after the local Berserk. Is he doin' as well as can
7928,REGULUS,be expected in his new caree-ah?'
7929,REGULUS,
7930,REGULUS,"'Better than you will, in a sec, Stalky,' Mullins grunted."
7931,REGULUS,
7932,REGULUS,'Glad of that. We thought he'd like to know that Paddy has been carried
7933,REGULUS,to the sick-house in ravin' delirium. They think it's concussion of
7934,REGULUS,the brain.'
7935,REGULUS,
7936,REGULUS,"'Why, he was all right at prayers,' Winton began earnestly, and they"
7937,REGULUS,heard a laugh in the background as Mullins slammed down the window.
7938,REGULUS,
7939,REGULUS,"''Night, Regulus,' Stalky sang out, and the light footsteps went on."
7940,REGULUS,
7941,REGULUS,"'You see. It sticks. A little of it sticks among the barbarians,' said"
7942,REGULUS,King.
7943,REGULUS,
7944,REGULUS,"'Amen,' said the Reverend John. 'Go to bed.'"

7999,A TRANSLATION,'Hi! Hi! Hold your horses! Stop!... Well! Well!' A lean man in a
8000,A TRANSLATION,sable-lined overcoat leaped from a private car and barred my way up Pall
8001,A TRANSLATION,Mall. 'You don't know me? You're excusable. I wasn't wearing much of

8019,A TRANSLATION,
8020,A TRANSLATION,"He settled himself on the deep dove-colour pneumatic cushions, and his"
8021,A TRANSLATION,smile was like the turning on of all the electrics. His teeth were
8022,A TRANSLATION,whiter than the ivory fittings. He smelt of rare soap and
8023,A TRANSLATION,cigarettes--such cigarettes as he handed me from a golden box with an
8024,A TRANSLATION,"automatic lighter. On my side of the car was a gold-mounted mirror, card"
8025,A TRANSLATION,and toilette case. I looked at him inquiringly.
8026,A TRANSLATION,
8027,A TRANSLATION,"'Yes,' he nodded, 'two years after I quit the Cape. She's not an Ohio"
8028,A TRANSLATION,"girl, though. She's in the country now. Is that right? She's at our"

8033,A TRANSLATION,
8034,A TRANSLATION,"'I surrender,' I said meekly. 'Did the Zigler automatic gun do all"
8035,A TRANSLATION,this?' I pointed to the car fittings.
8036,A TRANSLATION,
8037,A TRANSLATION,"'Psha! Think of your rememberin' that! Well, no. The Zigler is a great"

8039,A TRANSLATION,squander on pushing her in military society. I've leased my rights in

8043,A TRANSLATION,

8046,A TRANSLATION,
8047,A TRANSLATION,'A very great lady!' said he. 'I have enjoyed her hospitality. She
8048,A TRANSLATION,represents one of the most wonderful institutions in the world. The next

8051,A TRANSLATION,
8052,A TRANSLATION,"'Oh, you mean the Stores?' I said."
8053,A TRANSLATION,
8054,A TRANSLATION,'Mrs. Zigler means it more. They are quite ambassadorial in their

8059,A TRANSLATION,
8060,A TRANSLATION,"'I owe it to you,' Zigler began as smoothly as the car, 'to tell you"
8061,A TRANSLATION,what I am now. I represent the business end of the American Invasion.
8062,A TRANSLATION,Not the blame cars themselves--I wouldn't be found dead in one--but the
8063,A TRANSLATION,tools that make 'em. I am the Zigler Higher-Speed Tool and Lathe Trust.
8064,A TRANSLATION,"The Trust, sir, is entirely my own--in my own inventions. I am the"
8065,A TRANSLATION,Renzalaer ten-cylinder aÃ«rial--the lightest aeroplane-engine on the

8071,A TRANSLATION,to your late Queen? I owe every cent I have to that great an' good Lady.
8072,A TRANSLATION,"Yes, sir, I came out of Africa, after my eighteen months' rest-cure and"
8073,A TRANSLATION,"open-air treatment and sea-bathing, as her prisoner of war, like a giant"
8074,A TRANSLATION,"refreshed. There wasn't anything could hold me, when I'd got my hooks"
8075,A TRANSLATION,"into it, after that experience. And to you as a representative British"
8076,A TRANSLATION,"citizen, I say here and now that I regard you as the founder of the"
8077,A TRANSLATION,family fortune--Tommy's and mine.'
8078,A TRANSLATION,
8079,A TRANSLATION,'But I only gave you some papers and tobacco.'
8080,A TRANSLATION,
8081,A TRANSLATION,'What more does any citizen need? The Cullinan diamond wouldn't have
8082,A TRANSLATION,"helped me as much then; an'--talking about South Africa, tell me--'"
8083,A TRANSLATION,
8084,A TRANSLATION,We talked about South Africa till the car stopped at the Georgian lodge
8085,A TRANSLATION,of a great park.
8086,A TRANSLATION,
8087,A TRANSLATION,"'We'll get out here. I want to show you a rather sightly view,' said"
8088,A TRANSLATION,Zigler.
8089,A TRANSLATION,
8090,A TRANSLATION,"We walked, perhaps, half a mile, across timber-dotted turf, past a lake,"
8091,A TRANSLATION,"entered a dark rhododendron-planted wood, ticking with the noise of"
8092,A TRANSLATION,"pheasants' feet, and came out suddenly, where five rides met, at a small"
8093,A TRANSLATION,classic temple between lichened stucco statues which faced a circle of
8094,A TRANSLATION,"turf, several acres in extent. Irish yews, of a size that I had never"
8095,A TRANSLATION,"seen before, walled the sunless circle like cliffs of riven obsidian,"
8096,A TRANSLATION,"except at the lower end, where it gave on to a stretch of undulating"
8097,A TRANSLATION,bare ground ending in a timbered slope half-a-mile away.
8098,A TRANSLATION,
8099,A TRANSLATION,"'That's where the old Marshalton race-course used to be,' said Zigler."
8100,A TRANSLATION,'That ice-house is called Flora's Temple. Nell Gwynne and Mrs. Siddons
8101,A TRANSLATION,an' Taglioni an' all that crowd used to act plays here for King George
8102,A TRANSLATION,"the Third. Wasn't it? Well, George is the only king I play. Let it go at"
8103,A TRANSLATION,"that. This circle was the stage, I guess. The kings an' the nobility sat"
8104,A TRANSLATION,in Flora's Temple. I forget who sculped these statues at the door.
8105,A TRANSLATION,"They're the Comic and Tragic Muse. But it's a sightly view, ain't it?'"
8106,A TRANSLATION,
8107,A TRANSLATION,The sunlight was leaving the park. I caught a glint of silver to the
8108,A TRANSLATION,southward beyond the wooded ridge.
8109,A TRANSLATION,
8110,A TRANSLATION,"'That's the ocean--the Channel, I mean,' said Zigler. 'It's twenty-three"
8111,A TRANSLATION,"miles as a man flies. A sightly view, ain't it?'"
8112,A TRANSLATION,
8113,A TRANSLATION,"I looked at the severe yews, the dumb yelling mouths of the two statues,"
8114,A TRANSLATION,"at the blue-green shadows on the unsunned grass, and at the still bright"
8115,A TRANSLATION,plain in front where some deer were feeding.
8116,A TRANSLATION,
8117,A TRANSLATION,"'It's a most dramatic contrast, but I think it would be better on a"
8118,A TRANSLATION,"summer's day,' I said, and we went on, up one of the noiseless rides, a"
8119,A TRANSLATION,"quarter of a mile at least, till we came to the porticoed front of an"
8120,A TRANSLATION,enormous Georgian pile. Four footmen revealed themselves in a hall hung
8121,A TRANSLATION,with pictures.
8122,A TRANSLATION,
8123,A TRANSLATION,"'I hired this off of my Lord Marshalton,' Zigler explained, while they"
8124,A TRANSLATION,helped us out of our coats under the severe eyes of ruffed and
8125,A TRANSLATION,"periwigged ancestors. 'Ya-as. They always look at _me_ too, as if I'd"
8126,A TRANSLATION,"blown in from the gutter. Which, of course, I have. That's Mary, Lady"
8127,A TRANSLATION,Marshalton. Old man Joshua painted her. Do you see any likeness to my
8128,A TRANSLATION,"Lord Marshalton? Why, haven't you ever met up with him? He was Captain"
8129,A TRANSLATION,Mankeltow--my Royal British Artillery captain that blew up my gun in the
8130,A TRANSLATION,"war, an' then tried to bury me against my religious principles[4]."
8131,A TRANSLATION,Ya-as. His father died and he got the lordship. That was about all he
8132,A TRANSLATION,got by the time that your British death-duties were through with him. So
8133,A TRANSLATION,he said I'd oblige him by hiring his ranch. It's a hell an' a half of a
8134,A TRANSLATION,"proposition to handle, but Tommy--Mrs. Laughton--understands it. Come"
8135,A TRANSLATION,right in to the parlour and be very welcome.'
8136,A TRANSLATION,
8137,A TRANSLATION,"[Footnote 4: ""The Captive"": _Traffics and Discoveries_.]"
8138,A TRANSLATION,
8139,A TRANSLATION,"He guided me, hand on shoulder, into a babble of high-pitched talk and"
8140,A TRANSLATION,laughter that filled a vast drawing-room. He introduced me as the
8141,A TRANSLATION,"founder of the family fortunes to a little, lithe, dark-eyed woman whose"
8142,A TRANSLATION,speech and greeting were of the soft-lipped South. She in turn presented
8143,A TRANSLATION,"me to her mother, a black-browed snowy-haired old lady with a cap of"
8144,A TRANSLATION,"priceless Venetian point, hands that must have held many hearts in their"
8145,A TRANSLATION,"time, and a dignity as unquestioned and unquestioning as an empress. She"
8146,A TRANSLATION,"was, indeed, a Burton of Savannah, who, on their own ground, out-rank"
8147,A TRANSLATION,"the Lees of Virginia. The rest of the company came from Buffalo,"
8148,A TRANSLATION,"Cincinnati, Cleveland and Chicago, with here and there a softening"
8149,A TRANSLATION,southern strain. A party of young folk popped corn beneath a mantelpiece
8150,A TRANSLATION,"surmounted by a Gainsborough. Two portly men, half hidden by a cased"
8151,A TRANSLATION,"harp, discussed, over sheaves of typewritten documents, the terms of"
8152,A TRANSLATION,some contract. A knot of matrons talked servants--Irish _versus_
8153,A TRANSLATION,"German--across the grand piano. A youth ravaged an old bookcase, while"
8154,A TRANSLATION,"beside him a tall girl stared at the portrait of a woman of many loves,"
8155,A TRANSLATION,"dead three hundred years, but now leaping to life and warning under the"
8156,A TRANSLATION,shaded frame-light. In a corner half-a-dozen girls examined the glazed
8157,A TRANSLATION,tables that held the decorations--English and foreign--of the late Lord
8158,A TRANSLATION,Marshalton.
8159,A TRANSLATION,
8160,A TRANSLATION,"'See heah! Would this be the Ordeh of the Gyartah?' one said, pointing."
8161,A TRANSLATION,
8162,A TRANSLATION,"'I presoom likely. No! The Garter has ""_Honey swore_""--I know that much."
8163,A TRANSLATION,"This is ""Tria juncta"" something.'"
8164,A TRANSLATION,
8165,A TRANSLATION,"'Oh, what's that cunning little copper cross with ""For Valurr""?' a third"
8166,A TRANSLATION,cried.
8167,A TRANSLATION,
8168,A TRANSLATION,'Say! Look at here!' said the young man at the bookcase. 'Here's a first
8169,A TRANSLATION,edition of _Handley Cross_ and a Beewick's _Birds_ right next to
8170,A TRANSLATION,"it--just like so many best sellers. Look, Maidie!'"
8171,A TRANSLATION,
8172,A TRANSLATION,The girl beneath the picture half turned her body but not her eyes.
8173,A TRANSLATION,
8174,A TRANSLATION,'You don't tell _me_!' she said slowly. 'Their women amounted to
8175,A TRANSLATION,something after all.'
8176,A TRANSLATION,
8177,A TRANSLATION,"'But Woman's scope, and outlook was vurry limmutted in those days,' one"
8178,A TRANSLATION,"of the matrons put in, from the piano."
8179,A TRANSLATION,
8180,A TRANSLATION,"'Limmutted? For _her_? If they whurr, I guess she was the limmut. Who"
8181,A TRANSLATION,"was she? Peters, whurr's the cat'log?'"
8182,A TRANSLATION,
8183,A TRANSLATION,"A thin butler, in charge of two footmen removing the tea-batteries, slid"
8184,A TRANSLATION,to a table and handed her a blue-and-qilt book. He was button-holed by
8185,A TRANSLATION,"one of the men behind the harp, who wished to get a telephone call"
8186,A TRANSLATION,through to Edinburgh.
8187,A TRANSLATION,
8188,A TRANSLATION,"'The local office shuts at six,' said Peters. 'But I can get through"
8189,A TRANSLATION,"to'--he named some town--'in ten minutes, sir.'"
8190,A TRANSLATION,
8191,A TRANSLATION,"'That suits me. You'll find me here when you've hitched up. Oh, say,"
8192,A TRANSLATION,Peters! We--Mister Olpherts an' me--ain't goin' by that early morning
8193,A TRANSLATION,train to-morrow--but the other one--on the other line--whatever
8194,A TRANSLATION,they call it.'
8195,A TRANSLATION,
8196,A TRANSLATION,"'The nine twenty-seven, sir. Yes, sir. Early breakfast will be at"
8197,A TRANSLATION,half-past eight and the car will be at the door at nine.'
8198,A TRANSLATION,
8199,A TRANSLATION,'Peters!' an imperious young voice called. 'What's the matteh with Lord
8200,A TRANSLATION,Marshalton's Ordeh of the Gyartah? We cyan't find it anyweah.'
8201,A TRANSLATION,
8202,A TRANSLATION,"'Well, miss, I _have_ heard that that Order is usually returned to His"
8203,A TRANSLATION,"Majesty on the death of the holder. Yes, miss.' Then in a whisper to a"
8204,A TRANSLATION,"footman, 'More butter for the pop-corn in King Charles's Corner.' He"
8205,A TRANSLATION,"stopped behind my chair. 'Your room is Number Eleven, sir. May I trouble"
8206,A TRANSLATION,you for your keys?'
8207,A TRANSLATION,
8208,A TRANSLATION,He left the room with a six-year-old maiden called Alice who had
8209,A TRANSLATION,"announced she would not go to bed ''less Peter, Peter, Punkin-eater"
8210,A TRANSLATION,takes me--so there!'
8211,A TRANSLATION,
8212,A TRANSLATION,He very kindly looked in on me for a moment as I was dressing for
8213,A TRANSLATION,"dinner. 'Not at all, sir,' he replied to some compliment I paid him. 'I"
8214,A TRANSLATION,valeted the late Lord Marshalton for fifteen years. He was very abrupt
8215,A TRANSLATION,"in his movements, sir. As a rule I never received more than an hour's"
8216,A TRANSLATION,notice of a journey. We used to go to Syria frequently. I have been
8217,A TRANSLATION,"twice to Babylon. Mr. and Mrs. Zigler's requirements are, comparatively"
8218,A TRANSLATION,"speaking, few.'"
8219,A TRANSLATION,
8220,A TRANSLATION,'But the guests?'
8221,A TRANSLATION,
8222,A TRANSLATION,'Very little out of the ordinary as soon as one knows their ordinaries.
8223,A TRANSLATION,"Extremely simple, if I may say so, sir.'"
8224,A TRANSLATION,
8225,A TRANSLATION,"I had the privilege of taking Mrs. Burton in to dinner, and was rewarded"
8226,A TRANSLATION,"with an entirely new, and to me rather shocking view, of Abraham"
8227,A TRANSLATION,"Lincoln, who, she said, had wasted the heritage of his land by blood and"
8228,A TRANSLATION,"fire, and had surrendered the remnant to aliens. 'My brother, suh,' she"
8229,A TRANSLATION,"said, 'fell at Gettysburg in order that Armenians should colonise New"
8230,A TRANSLATION,England to-day. If I took any interest in any dam-Yankee outside of my
8231,A TRANSLATION,"son-in-law Laughton yondah, I should say that my brother's death had"
8232,A TRANSLATION,been amply avenged.'
8233,A TRANSLATION,
8234,A TRANSLATION,"The man at her right took up the challenge, and the war spread. Her eyes"
8235,A TRANSLATION,twinkled over the flames she had lit.
8236,A TRANSLATION,
8237,A TRANSLATION,"'Don't these folk,' she said a little later, 'remind you of Arabs"
8238,A TRANSLATION,picnicking under the Pyramids?'
8239,A TRANSLATION,
8240,A TRANSLATION,"'I've never seen the Pyramids,' I replied."
8241,A TRANSLATION,
8242,A TRANSLATION,"'Hm! I didn't know you were as English as all that.' And when I laughed,"
8243,A TRANSLATION,'Are you?'
8244,A TRANSLATION,
8245,A TRANSLATION,'Always. It saves trouble.'
8246,A TRANSLATION,
8247,A TRANSLATION,'Now that's just what I find so significant among the English'--this was
8248,A TRANSLATION,"Alice's mother, I think, with one elbow well forward among the salted"
8249,A TRANSLATION,"almonds. 'Oh, I know how _you_ feel, Madam Burton, but a Northerner"
8250,A TRANSLATION,like myself--I'm Buffalo--even though we come over every year--notices
8251,A TRANSLATION,the desire for comfort in England. There's so little conflict or uplift
8252,A TRANSLATION,in British society.'
8253,A TRANSLATION,
8254,A TRANSLATION,"'But we like being comfortable,' I said."
8255,A TRANSLATION,
8256,A TRANSLATION,"'I know it. It's very characteristic. But ain't it a little, just a"
8257,A TRANSLATION,"little, lacking in adaptability an' imagination?'"
8258,A TRANSLATION,
8259,A TRANSLATION,"'They haven't any need for adaptability,' Madam Burton struck in. 'They"
8260,A TRANSLATION,haven't any Ellis Island standards to live up to.'
8261,A TRANSLATION,
8262,A TRANSLATION,"'But we can assimilate,' the Buffalo woman charged on."
8263,A TRANSLATION,
8264,A TRANSLATION,'Now you _have_ done it!' I whispered to the old lady as the blessed
8265,A TRANSLATION,word 'assimilation' woke up all the old arguments for and against.
8266,A TRANSLATION,
8267,A TRANSLATION,There was not a dull moment in that dinner for me--nor afterwards when
8268,A TRANSLATION,the boys and girls at the piano played the rag-time tunes of their own
8269,A TRANSLATION,"land, while their elders, inexhaustibly interested, replunged into the"
8270,A TRANSLATION,"discussion of that land's future, till there was talk of coon-can. When"
8271,A TRANSLATION,all the company had been set to tables Zigler led me into his book-lined
8272,A TRANSLATION,"study, where I noticed he kept his golf-clubs, and spoke simply as a"
8273,A TRANSLATION,"child, gravely as a bishop, of the years that were past since our"
8274,A TRANSLATION,last meeting.
8275,A TRANSLATION,
8276,A TRANSLATION,"'That's about all, I guess--up to date,' he said when he had unrolled"
8277,A TRANSLATION,the bright map of his fortunes across three continents. 'Bein' rich
8278,A TRANSLATION,"suits me. So does your country, sir. My own country? You heard what"
8279,A TRANSLATION,"that Detroit man said at dinner. ""A Government of the alien, by the"
8280,A TRANSLATION,"alien, for the alien."" Mother's right, too. Lincoln killed us. From the"
8281,A TRANSLATION,"highest motives--but he killed us. Oh, say, that reminds me. 'J'ever"
8282,A TRANSLATION,kill a man from the highest motives?'
8283,A TRANSLATION,
8284,A TRANSLATION,'Not from any motive--as far as I remember.'
8285,A TRANSLATION,
8286,A TRANSLATION,"'Well, I have. It don't weigh on my mind any, but it was interesting."
8287,A TRANSLATION,Life _is_ interesting for a rich--for any--man in England. Ya-as! Life
8288,A TRANSLATION,in England is like settin' in the front row at the theatre and never
8289,A TRANSLATION,knowin' when the whole blame drama won't spill itself into your lap. I
8290,A TRANSLATION,"didn't always know that. I lie abed now, and I blush to think of some of"
8291,A TRANSLATION,the breaks I made in South Africa. About the British. Not your official
8292,A TRANSLATION,"method of doin' business. But the Spirit. I was 'way, 'way off on the"
8293,A TRANSLATION,Spirit. Are you acquainted with any other country where you'd have to
8294,A TRANSLATION,kill a man or two to get at the National Spirit?'
8295,A TRANSLATION,
8296,A TRANSLATION,"'Well,' I answered, 'next to marrying one of its women, killing one of"
8297,A TRANSLATION,its men makes for pretty close intimacy with any country. I take it you
8298,A TRANSLATION,killed a British citizen.'
8299,A TRANSLATION,
8300,A TRANSLATION,"'Why, no. Our syndicate confined its operations to aliens--dam-fool"
8301,A TRANSLATION,aliens.... 'J'ever know an English lord called Lundie[5]? Looks like a
8302,A TRANSLATION,frame-food and soap advertisement. I imagine he was in your Supreme

8306,A TRANSLATION,

8309,A TRANSLATION,
8310,A TRANSLATION,'That's as much beyond me as _this_!' Zigler slapped a fat Debrett on
8311,A TRANSLATION,the table. 'But I presoom this unreal Law Lord Lundie is kind o' real in
8312,A TRANSLATION,his decisions? I judged so. And--one more question. 'Ever meet a man

8314,A TRANSLATION,
8315,A TRANSLATION,"'D'you mean Burton-Walen, the editor of--?' I mentioned the journal."

8319,A TRANSLATION,
8320,A TRANSLATION,"'He does,' I said. 'Burton-Walen knows all the crowned heads of Europe"

8322,A TRANSLATION,
8323,A TRANSLATION,"'Well, there's the whole outfit for you--exceptin' my Lord Marshalton,"
8324,A TRANSLATION,"_nÃ©_ Mankeltow, an' me. All active murderers--specially the Law Lord--or"

8327,A TRANSLATION,
8328,A TRANSLATION,"'Twenty years, I believe,' was my reply."
8329,A TRANSLATION,
8330,A TRANSLATION,He reflected a moment.
8331,A TRANSLATION,
8332,A TRANSLATION,"'No-o-o,' he said, and followed it with a smoke-ring. 'Twenty months at"
8333,A TRANSLATION,"the Cape is my limit. Say, murder ain't the soul-shatterin' event those"
8334,A TRANSLATION,nature-fakers in the magazines make out. It develops naturally like any
8335,A TRANSLATION,"other proposition.... Say, 'j'ever play this golf game? It's come up in"
8336,A TRANSLATION,"the States from Maine to California, an' we're prodoocin' all the"
8337,A TRANSLATION,"champions in sight. Not a business man's play, but interestin'. I've got"
8338,A TRANSLATION,a golf-links in the park here that they tell me is the finest inland
8339,A TRANSLATION,course ever. I had to pay extra for that when I hired the ranche--last
8340,A TRANSLATION,year. It was just before I signed the papers that our murder
8341,A TRANSLATION,eventuated. My Lord Marshalton he asked me down for the week-end to fix
8342,A TRANSLATION,"up something or other--about Peters and the linen, I think 'twas. Mrs."
8343,A TRANSLATION,Zigler took a holt of the proposition. She understood Peters from the
8344,A TRANSLATION,"word ""go."" There wasn't any house-party; only fifteen or twenty folk. A"
8345,A TRANSLATION,"full house is thirty-two, Tommy tells me. 'Guess we must be near on that"
8346,A TRANSLATION,"to-night. In the smoking-room here, my Lord Marshalton--Mankeltow that"
8347,A TRANSLATION,was--introduces me to this Walen man with the nose. He'd been in the War
8348,A TRANSLATION,"too, from start to finish. He knew all the columns and generals that I'd"
8349,A TRANSLATION,battled with in the days of my Zigler gun. We kinder fell into each
8350,A TRANSLATION,other's arms an' let the harsh world go by for a while.
8351,A TRANSLATION,
8352,A TRANSLATION,'Walen he introduces me to your Lord Lundie. _He_ was a new proposition
8353,A TRANSLATION,to me. If he hadn't been a lawyer he'd have made a lovely cattle-king. I
8354,A TRANSLATION,thought I had played poker some. Another of my breaks. Ya-as! It cost me
8355,A TRANSLATION,eleven hundred dollars besides what Tommy said when I retired. I have no
8356,A TRANSLATION,"fault to find with your hereditary aristocracy, or your judiciary, or"
8357,A TRANSLATION,your press.
8358,A TRANSLATION,
8359,A TRANSLATION,'Sunday we all went to Church across the Park here.... Psha! Think o'
8360,A TRANSLATION,your rememberin' my religion! I've become an Episcopalian since I
8361,A TRANSLATION,married. Ya-as.... After lunch Walen did his crowned-heads-of-Europe
8362,A TRANSLATION,stunt in the smokin'-room here. He was long on Kings. And Continental
8363,A TRANSLATION,"crises. I do not pretend to follow British domestic politics, but in the"
8364,A TRANSLATION,aeroplane business a man has to know something of international
8365,A TRANSLATION,"possibilities. At present, you British are settin' in kimonoes on"
8366,A TRANSLATION,dynamite kegs. Walen's talk put me wise on the location and size of some
8367,A TRANSLATION,of the kegs. Ya-as!
8368,A TRANSLATION,
8369,A TRANSLATION,"'After that, we four went out to look at those golf-links I was hirin'."
8370,A TRANSLATION,We each took a club. Mine'--he glanced at a great tan bag by the
8371,A TRANSLATION,"fire-place--'was the beginner's friend--the cleek. Well, sir, this golf"
8372,A TRANSLATION,proposition took a holt of me as quick as--quick as death. They had to
8373,A TRANSLATION,"prise me off the greens when it got too dark to see, and then we went"
8374,A TRANSLATION,back to the house. I was walkin' ahead with my Lord Marshalton talkin'
8375,A TRANSLATION,beginners' golf. (_I_ was the man who ought to have been killed by
8376,A TRANSLATION,rights.) We cut 'cross lots through the woods to Flora's Temple--that
8377,A TRANSLATION,"place I showed you this afternoon. Lundie and Walen were, maybe, twenty"
8378,A TRANSLATION,or thirty rod behind us in the dark. Marshalton and I stopped at the
8379,A TRANSLATION,theatre to admire at the ancestral yew-trees. He took me right under the
8380,A TRANSLATION,biggest--King Somebody's Yew--and while I was spannin' it with my
8381,A TRANSLATION,"handkerchief, he says, ""Look heah!"" just as if it was a rabbit--and down"
8382,A TRANSLATION,comes a bi-plane into the theatre with no more noise than the dead. My
8383,A TRANSLATION,Rush Silencer is the only one on the market that allows that sort of
8384,A TRANSLATION,gumshoe work.... What? A bi-plane--with two men in it. Both men jump out
8385,A TRANSLATION,and start fussin' with the engines. I was starting to tell Mankeltow--I
8386,A TRANSLATION,can't remember to call him Marshalton any more--that it looked as if the
8387,A TRANSLATION,Royal British Flying Corps had got on to my Rush Silencer at last; but
8388,A TRANSLATION,"he steps out from under the yew to these two Stealthy Steves and says,"
8389,A TRANSLATION,"""What's the trouble? Can I be of any service?"" He thought--so did"
8390,A TRANSLATION,"I--'twas some of the boys from Aldershot or Salisbury. Well, sir, from"
8391,A TRANSLATION,"there on, the situation developed like a motion-picture in Hell. The man"
8392,A TRANSLATION,"on the nigh side of the machine whirls round, pulls his gun and fires"
8393,A TRANSLATION,into Mankeltow's face. I laid him out with my cleek automatically. Any
8394,A TRANSLATION,one who shoots a friend of mine gets what's comin' to him if I'm within
8395,A TRANSLATION,reach. He drops. Mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief. The man
8396,A TRANSLATION,"the far side of the machine starts to run. Lundie down the ride, or it"
8397,A TRANSLATION,"might have been Walen, shouts, ""What's happened?"" Mankeltow says,"
8398,A TRANSLATION,"""Collar that chap."""
8399,A TRANSLATION,
8400,A TRANSLATION,"'The second man runs ring-a-ring-o'-roses round the machine, one hand"
8401,A TRANSLATION,reachin' behind him. Mankeltow heads him off to me. He breaks blind for
8402,A TRANSLATION,"Walen and Lundie, who are runnin' up the ride. There's some sort of"
8403,A TRANSLATION,"mix-up among 'em, which it's too dark to see, and a thud. Walen says,"
8404,A TRANSLATION,"""Oh, well collared!"" Lundie says, ""That's the only thing I never learned"

8416,A TRANSLATION,
8417,A TRANSLATION,"'""My God!"" says Lundie. ""Did I? I thought it was my suspenders""--no, he"
8418,A TRANSLATION,"said ""braces."""
8419,A TRANSLATION,
8420,A TRANSLATION,"'Right there I left them and sort o' tiptoed back to my man, hopin' he'd"
8421,A TRANSLATION,revived and quit. But he hadn't. That darned cleek had hit him on the
8422,A TRANSLATION,back of the neck just where his helmet stopped. He'd got _his_. I knew
8423,A TRANSLATION,it by the way the head rolled in my hands. Then the others came up the
8424,A TRANSLATION,ride totin' _their_ load. No mistakin' that shuffle on grass. D'you
8425,A TRANSLATION,remember it--in South Africa? Ya-as.
8426,A TRANSLATION,

8438,A TRANSLATION,"Flora's Temple."""
8439,A TRANSLATION,
8440,A TRANSLATION,We toted 'em again and laid 'em out on a stone bench. They were still
8441,A TRANSLATION,"dead in spite of our best attentions. We knew it, but we went through"
8442,A TRANSLATION,the motions till it was quite dark. 'Wonder if all murderers do that?

8765,REBIRTH,[Footnote 6: Now Viscount Haldane of Cloan.]
8766,REBIRTH,
8767,REBIRTH,"My instructions to Mr. Leggatt, my engineer, had been accurately obeyed."
8768,REBIRTH,"He was to bring my car on completion of annual overhaul, from Coventry"
8769,REBIRTH,"_via_ London, to Southampton Docks to await my arrival; and very pretty"
8770,REBIRTH,"she looked, under the steamer's side among the railway lines, at six in"
8771,REBIRTH,the morning. Next to her new paint and varnish I was most impressed by
8772,REBIRTH,her four brand-new tyres.
8773,REBIRTH,
8774,REBIRTH,"'But I didn't order new tyres,' I said as we moved away. 'These are"
8775,REBIRTH,"Irresilients, too.'"
8776,REBIRTH,
8777,REBIRTH,"'Treble-ribbed,' said Leggatt. 'Diamond-stud sheathing.'"
8778,REBIRTH,
8779,REBIRTH,'Then there has been a mistake.'
8780,REBIRTH,
8781,REBIRTH,"'Oh no, sir; they're gratis.'"
8782,REBIRTH,
8783,REBIRTH,The number of motor manufacturers who give away complete sets of
8784,REBIRTH,treble-ribbed Irresilient tyres is so limited that I believe I asked
8785,REBIRTH,Leggatt for an explanation.
8786,REBIRTH,
8787,REBIRTH,"'I don't know that I could very well explain, sir,' was the answer. 'It"
8788,REBIRTH,'ud come better from Mr. Pyecroft. He's on leaf at Portsmouth--staying
8789,REBIRTH,with his uncle. His uncle 'ad the body all night. I'd defy you to find a
8790,REBIRTH,scratch on her even with a microscope.'
8791,REBIRTH,
8792,REBIRTH,"'Then we will go home by the Portsmouth road,' I said."
8793,REBIRTH,
8794,REBIRTH,And we went at those speeds which are allowed before the working-day
8795,REBIRTH,begins or the police are thawed out. We were blocked near Portsmouth by
8796,REBIRTH,a battalion of Regulars on the move.
8797,REBIRTH,
8798,REBIRTH,"'Whitsuntide manoeuvres just ending,' said Leggatt. 'They've had a"
8799,REBIRTH,fortnight in the Downs.'
8800,REBIRTH,
8801,REBIRTH,He said no more until we were in a narrow street somewhere behind
8802,REBIRTH,"Portsmouth Town Railway Station, where he slowed at a green-grocery"
8803,REBIRTH,"shop. The door was open, and a small old man sat on three potato-baskets"
8804,REBIRTH,swinging his feet over a stooping blue back.
8805,REBIRTH,
8806,REBIRTH,'You call that shinin' 'em?' he piped. 'Can you see your face in 'em
8807,REBIRTH,"yet? No! Then shine 'em, or I'll give you a beltin' you'll remember!'"
8808,REBIRTH,
8809,REBIRTH,"'If you stop kickin' me in the mouth perhaps I'd do better,' said"
8810,REBIRTH,Pyecroft's voice meekly.
8811,REBIRTH,
8812,REBIRTH,We blew the horn.
8813,REBIRTH,
8814,REBIRTH,"Pyecroft arose, put away the brushes, and received us not otherwise than"
8815,REBIRTH,as a king in his own country.
8816,REBIRTH,
8817,REBIRTH,'Are you going to leave me up here all day?' said the old man.
8818,REBIRTH,
8819,REBIRTH,Pyecroft lifted him down and he hobbled into the back room.
8820,REBIRTH,
8821,REBIRTH,"'It's his corns,' Pyecroft explained. 'You can't shine corny feet--and"
8822,REBIRTH,he hasn't had his breakfast.'
8823,REBIRTH,
8824,REBIRTH,"'I haven't had mine either,' I said."
8825,REBIRTH,
8826,REBIRTH,"'Breakfast for two more, uncle,' Pyecroft sang out."
8827,REBIRTH,
8828,REBIRTH,"'Go out an' buy it then,' was the answer, 'or else it's half-rations.'"
8829,REBIRTH,
8830,REBIRTH,"Pyecroft turned to Leggatt, gave him his marketing orders, and"
8831,REBIRTH,despatched him with the coppers.
8832,REBIRTH,
8833,REBIRTH,"'I have got four new tyres on my car,' I began impressively."
8834,REBIRTH,
8835,REBIRTH,"'Yes,' said Mr. Pyecroft. 'You have, and I _will_ say'--he patted my"
8836,REBIRTH,car's bonnet--'you earned 'em.'
8837,REBIRTH,
8838,REBIRTH,"'I want to know why--,' I went on."
8839,REBIRTH,
8840,REBIRTH,"'Quite justifiable. You haven't noticed anything in the papers, have"
8841,REBIRTH,you?'
8842,REBIRTH,
8843,REBIRTH,'I've only just landed. I haven't seen a paper for weeks.'
8844,REBIRTH,
8845,REBIRTH,'Then you can lend me a virgin ear. There's been a scandal in the
8846,REBIRTH,"Junior Service--the Army, I believe they call 'em.'"
8847,REBIRTH,
8848,REBIRTH,"A bag of coffee-beans pitched on the counter. 'Roast that,' said the"
8849,REBIRTH,uncle from within.
8850,REBIRTH,
8851,REBIRTH,"Pyecroft rigged a small coffee-roaster, while I took down the shutters,"
8852,REBIRTH,and sold a young lady in curl-papers two bunches of mixed greens and one
8853,REBIRTH,soft orange.
8854,REBIRTH,
8855,REBIRTH,"'Sickly stuff to handle on an empty stomach, ain't it?' said Pyecroft."
8856,REBIRTH,
8857,REBIRTH,'What about my new tyres?' I insisted.
8858,REBIRTH,
8859,REBIRTH,"'Oh, any amount. But the question is'--he looked at me steadily--'is"
8860,REBIRTH,this what you might call a court-martial or a post-mortem inquiry?'
8861,REBIRTH,
8862,REBIRTH,"'Strictly a post-mortem,' said I."
8863,REBIRTH,
8864,REBIRTH,"'That being so,' said Pyecroft, 'we can rapidly arrive at facts. Last"
8865,REBIRTH,Thursday--the shutters go behind those baskets--last Thursday at five
8866,REBIRTH,"bells in the forenoon watch, otherwise ten-thirty A.M., your Mr. Leggatt"
8867,REBIRTH,was discovered on Westminster Bridge laying his course for the Old
8868,REBIRTH,Kent Road.'
8869,REBIRTH,
8870,REBIRTH,"'But that doesn't lead to Southampton,' I interrupted."
8871,REBIRTH,
8872,REBIRTH,"'Then perhaps he was swinging the car for compasses. Be that as it may,"
8873,REBIRTH,"we found him in that latitude, simultaneous as Jules and me was _ong"
8874,REBIRTH,route_ for Waterloo to rejoin our respective ships--or Navies I should
8875,REBIRTH,"say. Jules was a _permissionaire_, which meant being on leaf, same as"
8876,REBIRTH,"me, from a French cassowary-cruiser at Portsmouth. A party of her trusty"
8877,REBIRTH,"and well-beloved petty officers 'ad been seeing London, chaperoned by"
8878,REBIRTH,the R.C. Chaplain. Jules 'ad detached himself from the squadron and was
8879,REBIRTH,"cruisin' on his own when I joined him, in company of copious"
8880,REBIRTH,"lady-friends. _But_, mark you, your Mr. Leggatt drew the line at the"
8881,REBIRTH,girls. Loud and long he drew it.'
8882,REBIRTH,
8883,REBIRTH,"'I'm glad of that,' I said."
8884,REBIRTH,
8885,REBIRTH,"'You may be. He adopted the puristical formation from the first. ""Yes,"""
8886,REBIRTH,"he said, when we was annealing him at--but you wouldn't know the pub--""I"
8887,REBIRTH,"_am_ going to Southampton,"" he says, ""and I'll stretch a point to go"
8888,REBIRTH,"_via_ Portsmouth; _but_,"" says he, ""seeing what sort of one hell of a"
8889,REBIRTH,"time invariably trarnspires when we cruise together, Mr. Pyecroft, I do"
8890,REBIRTH,_not_ feel myself justified towards my generous and long-suffering
8891,REBIRTH,"employer in takin' on that kind of ballast as well."" I assure you he"
8892,REBIRTH,considered your interests.'
8893,REBIRTH,
8894,REBIRTH,'And the girls?' I asked.
8895,REBIRTH,
8896,REBIRTH,"'Oh, I left that to Jules. I'm a monogomite by nature. So we embarked"
8897,REBIRTH,"strictly _ong garÃ§ong_. But I should tell you, in case he didn't, that"
8898,REBIRTH,your Mr. Leggatt's care for your interests 'ad extended to sheathing the
8899,REBIRTH,car in matting and gunny-bags to preserve her paint-work. She was all
8900,REBIRTH,swathed up like an I-talian baby.'
8901,REBIRTH,
8902,REBIRTH,"'He _is_ careful about his paint-work,' I said."
8903,REBIRTH,
8904,REBIRTH,'For a man with no Service experience I should say he was fair homicidal
8905,REBIRTH,on the subject. If we'd been Marines he couldn't have been more pointed
8906,REBIRTH,"in his allusions to our hob-nailed socks. However, we reduced him to a"
8907,REBIRTH,"malleable condition, and embarked for Portsmouth. I'd seldom rejoined"
8908,REBIRTH,"my _vaisseau ong automobile, avec_ a fur coat and goggles. Nor"
8909,REBIRTH,'ad Jules.'
8910,REBIRTH,
8911,REBIRTH,"'Did Jules say much?' I asked, helplessly turning the handle of the"
8912,REBIRTH,coffee-roaster.
8913,REBIRTH,
8914,REBIRTH,"'That's where I pitied the pore beggar. He 'adn't the language, so to"
8915,REBIRTH,speak. He was confined to heavings and shruggin's and copious _Mong
8916,REBIRTH,Jews_! The French are very badly fitted with relief-valves. And then our
8917,REBIRTH,Mr. Leggatt drove. He drove.'
8918,REBIRTH,
8919,REBIRTH,'Was he in a very malleable condition?'
8920,REBIRTH,
8921,REBIRTH,'Not him! We recognised the value of his cargo from the outset. He
8922,REBIRTH,hadn't a chance to get more than moist at the edges. After which we went
8923,REBIRTH,to sleep; and now we'll go to breakfast.'
8924,REBIRTH,
8925,REBIRTH,"We entered the back room where everything was in order, and a screeching"
8926,REBIRTH,canary made us welcome. The uncle had added sausages and piles of
8927,REBIRTH,"buttered toast to the kippers. The coffee, cleared with a piece of"
8928,REBIRTH,"fish-skin, was a revelation."
8929,REBIRTH,
8930,REBIRTH,"Leggatt, who seemed to know the premises, had run the car into the tiny"
8931,REBIRTH,backyard where her mirror-like back almost blocked up the windows. He
8932,REBIRTH,minded shop while we ate. Pyecroft passed him his rations through a flap
8933,REBIRTH,"in the door. The uncle ordered him in, after breakfast, to wash up, and"
8934,REBIRTH,he jumped in his gaiters at the old man's commands as he has never
8935,REBIRTH,jumped to mine.
8936,REBIRTH,
8937,REBIRTH,"'To resoom the post-mortem,' said Pyecroft, lighting his pipe. 'My"
8938,REBIRTH,"slumbers were broken by the propeller ceasing to revolve, and by vile"
8939,REBIRTH,language from your Mr. Leggatt.'
8940,REBIRTH,
8941,REBIRTH,"'I--I--' Leggatt began, a blue-checked duster in one hand and a cup in"
8942,REBIRTH,the other.
8943,REBIRTH,
8944,REBIRTH,"'When you're wanted aft you'll be sent for, Mr. Leggatt,' said Pyecroft"
8945,REBIRTH,"amiably. 'It's clean mess decks for you now. Resooming once more, we was"
8946,REBIRTH,"on a lonely and desolate ocean near Portsdown, surrounded by gorse"
8947,REBIRTH,"bushes, and a Boy Scout was stirring my stomach with his little"
8948,REBIRTH,copper-stick.'
8949,REBIRTH,
8950,REBIRTH,"'""You count ten,"" he says."
8951,REBIRTH,
8952,REBIRTH,"'""Very good, Boy Jones,"" I says, ""count 'em,"" and I hauled him in over"
8953,REBIRTH,"the gunnel, and ten I gave him with my large flat hand. The remarks he"
8954,REBIRTH,"passed, lying face down tryin' to bite my leg, would have reflected"
8955,REBIRTH,"credit on any Service. Having finished I dropped him overboard again,"
8956,REBIRTH,which was my gross political error. I ought to 'ave killed him; because
8957,REBIRTH,he began signalling--rapid and accurate--in a sou'westerly direction.
8958,REBIRTH,Few equatorial calms are to be apprehended when B.P.'s little pets take
8959,REBIRTH,to signallin'. Make a note o' that! Three minutes later we were stopped
8960,REBIRTH,"and boarded by Scouts--up our backs, down our necks, and in our boots!"
8961,REBIRTH,"The last I heard from your Mr. Leggatt as he went under, brushin' 'em"
8962,REBIRTH,"off his cap, was thanking Heaven he'd covered up the new paint-work with"
8963,REBIRTH,mats. An 'eroic soul!'
8964,REBIRTH,
8965,REBIRTH,"'Not a scratch on her body,' said Leggatt, pouring out the"
8966,REBIRTH,coffee-grounds.
8967,REBIRTH,
8968,REBIRTH,'And Jules?' said I.
8969,REBIRTH,
8970,REBIRTH,"'Oh, Jules thought the much advertised Social Revolution had begun, but"
8971,REBIRTH,his mackintosh hampered him.
8972,REBIRTH,
8973,REBIRTH,"'You told me to bring the mackintosh,' Leggatt whispered to me."
8974,REBIRTH,
8975,REBIRTH,'And when I 'ad 'em half convinced he was a French vicomte coming down
8976,REBIRTH,"to visit the Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, he tried to take it off."
8977,REBIRTH,"Seeing his uniform underneath, some sucking Sherlock Holmes of the Pink"
8978,REBIRTH,Eye Patrol (they called him Eddy) deduced that I wasn't speaking
8979,REBIRTH,the truth. Eddy said I was tryin' to sneak into Portsmouth
8980,REBIRTH,unobserved--unobserved mark you!--and join hands with the enemy. It
8981,REBIRTH,trarnspired that the Scouts was conducting a field-day against opposin'
8982,REBIRTH,"forces, ably assisted by all branches of the Service, and they was so"
8983,REBIRTH,"afraid the car wouldn't count ten points to them in the fray, that"
8984,REBIRTH,"they'd have scalped us, but for the intervention of an umpire--also in"
8985,REBIRTH,short under-drawers. A fleshy sight!'
8986,REBIRTH,
8987,REBIRTH,"Here Mr. Pyecroft shut his eyes and nodded. 'That umpire,' he said"
8988,REBIRTH,"suddenly, 'was our Mr. Morshed--a gentleman whose acquaintance you have"
8989,REBIRTH,"already made _and_ profited by, if I mistake not[7].'"
8990,REBIRTH,
8991,REBIRTH,"[Footnote 7: 'Their Lawful Occasions,' _Traffics and Discoveries_.]"
8992,REBIRTH,
8993,REBIRTH,"'Oh, was the Navy in it too?' I said; for I had read of wild doings"
8994,REBIRTH,"occasionally among the Boy Scouts on the Portsmouth Road, in which Navy,"
8995,REBIRTH,"Army, and the world at large seemed to have taken part."
8996,REBIRTH,
8997,REBIRTH,'The Navy _was_ in it. I was the only one out of it--for several
8998,REBIRTH,"seconds. Our Mr. Morshed failed to recognise me in my fur boa, and my"
8999,REBIRTH,appealin' winks at 'im behind your goggles didn't arrive. But when Eddy
9000,REBIRTH,"darling had told his story, I saluted, which is difficult in furs, and I"
9001,REBIRTH,stated I was bringin' him dispatches from the North. My Mr. Morshed
9002,REBIRTH,cohered on the instant. I've never known his ethergram installations out
9003,REBIRTH,"of order yet. ""Go and guard your blessed road,"" he says to the Fratton"
9004,REBIRTH,"Orphan Asylum standing at attention all round him, and, when they was"
9005,REBIRTH,"removed--""Pyecroft,"" he says, still _sotte voce_, ""what in Hong-Kong are"
9006,REBIRTH,"you doing with this dun-coloured _sampan_?"""
9007,REBIRTH,
9008,REBIRTH,'It was your Mr. Leggatt's paint-protective matting which caught his
9009,REBIRTH,"eye. She _did_ resemble a _sampan_, especially about the stern-works. At"
9010,REBIRTH,"these remarks I naturally threw myself on 'is bosom, so far as Service"
9011,REBIRTH,"conditions permitted, and revealed him all, mentioning that the car was"
9012,REBIRTH,"yours. You know his way of working his lips like a rabbit? Yes, he was"
9013,REBIRTH,"quite pleased. ""_His_ car!"" he kept murmuring, working his lips like a"
9014,REBIRTH,"rabbit. ""I owe 'im more than a trifle for things he wrote about me. I'll"
9015,REBIRTH,"keep the car."""
9016,REBIRTH,
9017,REBIRTH,'Your Mr. Leggatt now injected some semi-mutinous remarks to the effect
9018,REBIRTH,"that he was your chauffeur in charge of your car, and, as such, capable"
9019,REBIRTH,of so acting. Mr. Morshed threw him a glarnce. It sufficed. Didn't it
9020,REBIRTH,"suffice, Mr. Leggatt?'"
9021,REBIRTH,
9022,REBIRTH,"'I knew if something didn't happen, something worse would,' said"
9023,REBIRTH,Leggatt. 'It never fails when you're aboard.'
9024,REBIRTH,
9025,REBIRTH,'And Jules?' I demanded.
9026,REBIRTH,
9027,REBIRTH,"'Jules was, so to speak, panicking in a water-tight flat through his"
9028,REBIRTH,unfortunate lack of language. I had to introduce him as part of the
9029,REBIRTH,"_entente cordiale_, and he was put under arrest, too. Then we sat on the"
9030,REBIRTH,"grass and smoked, while Eddy and Co. violently annoyed the traffic on"
9031,REBIRTH,"the Portsmouth Road, till the umpires, all in short panties, conferred"
9032,REBIRTH,"on the valuable lessons of the field-day and added up points, same as at"
9033,REBIRTH,"target-practice. I didn't hear their conclusions, but our Mr. Morshed"
9034,REBIRTH,"delivered a farewell address to Eddy and Co., tellin' 'em they ought to"
9035,REBIRTH,"have deduced from a hundred signs about me, that I was a friendly"
9036,REBIRTH,bringin' in dispatches from the North. We left 'em tryin' to find those
9037,REBIRTH,"signs in the Scout book, and we reached Mr. Morshed's hotel at"
9038,REBIRTH,Portsmouth at 6.27 P.M. _ong automobile_. Here endeth the
9039,REBIRTH,first chapter.'
9040,REBIRTH,
9041,REBIRTH,"'Begin the second,' I said."
9042,REBIRTH,
9043,REBIRTH,"The uncle and Leggatt had finished washing up and were seated, smoking,"
9044,REBIRTH,while the damp duster dried at the fire.
9045,REBIRTH,
9046,REBIRTH,"'About what time was it,' said Pyecroft to Leggatt, 'when our Mr."
9047,REBIRTH,Morshed began to talk about uncles?'
9048,REBIRTH,
9049,REBIRTH,"'When he came back to the bar, after he'd changed into those rat-catcher"
9050,REBIRTH,"clothes,' said Leggatt."
9051,REBIRTH,
9052,REBIRTH,"'That's right. ""Pye,"" said he, ""have you an uncle?"" ""I have,"" I says."
9053,REBIRTH,"""Here's santy to him,"" and I finished my sherry and bitters to"
9054,REBIRTH,"_you_, uncle.'"
9055,REBIRTH,
9056,REBIRTH,"'That's right,' said Pyecroft's uncle sternly. 'If you hadn't I'd have"
9057,REBIRTH,"belted you worth rememberin', Emmanuel. I had the body all night.'"
9058,REBIRTH,
9059,REBIRTH,"Pyecroft smiled affectionately. 'So you 'ad, uncle, an' beautifully you"
9060,REBIRTH,"looked after her. But as I was saying, ""I have an uncle, too,"" says Mr."
9061,REBIRTH,"Morshed, dark and lowering. ""Yet somehow I can't love him. I want to"
9062,REBIRTH,"mortify the beggar. Volunteers to mortify my uncle, one pace to"
9063,REBIRTH,"the front."""
9064,REBIRTH,
9065,REBIRTH,'I took Jules with me the regulation distance. Jules was getting
9066,REBIRTH,interested. Your Mr. Leggatt preserved a strictly nootral attitude.
9067,REBIRTH,
9068,REBIRTH,"'""You're a pressed man,"" says our Mr. Morshed. ""I owe your late employer"
9069,REBIRTH,"much, so to say. The car will manoeuvre all night, as requisite."""
9070,REBIRTH,
9071,REBIRTH,"'Mr. Leggatt come out noble as your employee, and, by 'Eaven's divine"
9072,REBIRTH,"grace, instead of arguing, he pleaded his new paint and varnish which"
9073,REBIRTH,was Mr. Morshed's one vital spot (he's lootenant on one of the new
9074,REBIRTH,"catch-'em-alive-o's now). ""True,"" says he, ""paint's an 'oly thing. I'll"
9075,REBIRTH,give you one hour to arrange a _modus vivendi_. Full bunkers and steam
9076,REBIRTH,"ready by 9 P.M. to-night, _if_ you please."""
9077,REBIRTH,
9078,REBIRTH,"'Even so, Mr. Leggatt was far from content. _I_ 'ad to arrange the"
9079,REBIRTH,details. We run her into the yard here.' Pyecroft nodded through the
9080,REBIRTH,window at my car's glossy back-panels. 'We took off the body with its
9081,REBIRTH,"mats and put it in the stable, substitooting (and that yard's a tight"
9082,REBIRTH,fit for extensive repairs) the body of uncle's blue delivery cart. It
9083,REBIRTH,"overhung a trifle, but after I'd lashed it I knew it wouldn't fetch"
9084,REBIRTH,"loose. Thus, in our composite cruiser, we repaired once more to the"
9085,REBIRTH,"hotel, and was immediately dispatched to the toy-shop in the High Street"
9086,REBIRTH,where we took aboard one rocking-horse which was waiting for us.'
9087,REBIRTH,
9088,REBIRTH,'Took aboard _what_?' I cried.
9089,REBIRTH,
9090,REBIRTH,"'One fourteen-hand dapple-grey rocking-horse, with pure green rockers"
9091,REBIRTH,"and detachable tail, pair gashly glass eyes, complete set 'orrible"
9092,REBIRTH,"grinnin' teeth, and two bloody-red nostrils which, protruding from the"
9093,REBIRTH,"brown papers, produced the _tout ensemble_ of a Ju-ju sacrifice in the"
9094,REBIRTH,Benin campaign. Do I make myself comprehensible?'
9095,REBIRTH,
9096,REBIRTH,'Perfectly. Did you say anything?' I asked.
9097,REBIRTH,
9098,REBIRTH,"'Only to Jules. To him, I says, wishing to try him. ""_Allez Ã  votre"
9099,REBIRTH,"bateau. Je say mon Lootenong. Eel voo donneray porkwor_."" To me, says"
9100,REBIRTH,"he, ""_Vous ong ate hurroo! Jamay de la vee_!"" and I saw by his eye he'd"
9101,REBIRTH,"taken on for the full term of the war. Jules was a blue-eyed,"
9102,REBIRTH,brindle-haired beggar of a useful make and inquirin' habits. Your Mr.
9103,REBIRTH,Leggatt he only groaned.'
9104,REBIRTH,
9105,REBIRTH,"Leggatt nodded. 'It was like nightmares,' he said. 'It was like"
9106,REBIRTH,nightmares.'
9107,REBIRTH,
9108,REBIRTH,"'Once more, then,' Pyecroft swept on, 'we returned to the hotel and"
9109,REBIRTH,"partook of a sumptuous repast, under the able and genial chairmanship of"
9110,REBIRTH,"our Mr. Morshed, who laid his projecks unreservedly before us. ""In the"
9111,REBIRTH,"first place,"" he says, opening out bicycle-maps, ""my uncle, who, I"
9112,REBIRTH,"regret to say, is a brigadier-general, has sold his alleged soul to"
9113,REBIRTH,"Dicky Bridoon for a feathery hat and a pair o' gilt spurs. Jules,"
9114,REBIRTH,"_conspuez l'oncle_!"" So Jules, you'll be glad to hear--'"
9115,REBIRTH,
9116,REBIRTH,"'One minute, Pye,' I said. 'Who is Dicky Bridoon?'"
9117,REBIRTH,
9118,REBIRTH,'I don't usually mingle myself up with the bickerings of the Junior
9119,REBIRTH,"Service, but it trarnspired that he was Secretary o' State for Civil"
9120,REBIRTH,"War, an' he'd been issuing mechanical leather-belly gee-gees which"
9121,REBIRTH,doctors recommend for tumour--to the British cavalry in loo of real meat
9122,REBIRTH,"horses, to learn to ride on. Don't you remember there was quite a stir"
9123,REBIRTH,in the papers owing to the cavalry not appreciatin' 'em? But that's a
9124,REBIRTH,"minor item. The main point was that our uncle, in his capacity of"
9125,REBIRTH,"brigadier-general, mark you, had wrote to the papers highly approvin' o'"
9126,REBIRTH,Dicky Bridoon's mechanical substitutes an 'ad thus obtained
9127,REBIRTH,promotion--all same as a agnosticle stoker psalm-singin' 'imself up the
9128,REBIRTH,Service under a pious captain. At that point of the narrative we caught
9129,REBIRTH,a phosphorescent glimmer why the rocking-horse might have been issued;
9130,REBIRTH,but none the less the navigation was intricate. Omitting the fact it was
9131,REBIRTH,"dark and cloudy, our brigadier-uncle lay somewhere in the South Downs"
9132,REBIRTH,"with his brigade, which was manoeuvrin' at Whitsum manoeuvres on a large"
9133,REBIRTH,"scale--Red Army _versus_ Blue, et cetera; an' all we 'ad to go by was"
9134,REBIRTH,those flapping bicycle-maps and your Mr. Leggatt's groans.'
9135,REBIRTH,
9136,REBIRTH,"'I was thinking what the Downs mean after dark,' said Leggatt angrily."
9137,REBIRTH,
9138,REBIRTH,"'They was worth thinkin' of,' said Pyecroft. 'When we had studied the"
9139,REBIRTH,"map till it fair spun, we decided to sally forth and creep for uncle by"
9140,REBIRTH,"hand in the dark, dark night, an' present 'im with the rocking-horse. So"
9141,REBIRTH,we embarked at 8.57 P.M.'
9142,REBIRTH,
9143,REBIRTH,"'One minute again, please. How much did Jules understand by that time?'"
9144,REBIRTH,I asked.
9145,REBIRTH,
9146,REBIRTH,"'Sufficient unto the day--or night, perhaps I should say. He told our"
9147,REBIRTH,"Mr. Morshed he'd follow him _more sang frays_, which is French for dead,"
9148,REBIRTH,"drunk, or damned. Barrin' 'is paucity o' language, there wasn't a"
9149,REBIRTH,"blemish on Jules. But what I wished to imply was, when we climbed into"
9150,REBIRTH,"the back parts of the car, our Lootenant Morshed says to me, ""I doubt if"
9151,REBIRTH,"I'd flick my cigar-ends about too lavish, Mr. Pyecroft. We ought to be"
9152,REBIRTH,"sitting on five pounds' worth of selected fireworks, and I think the"
9153,REBIRTH,"rockets are your end."" Not being able to smoke with my 'ead over the"
9154,REBIRTH,"side I threw it away; and then your Mr. Leggatt, 'aving been as nearly"
9155,REBIRTH,"mutinous as it pays to be with my Mr. Morshed, arched his back"
9156,REBIRTH,and drove.'
9157,REBIRTH,
9158,REBIRTH,"'Where did he drive to, please?' said I."
9159,REBIRTH,
9160,REBIRTH,"'Primerrily, in search of any or either or both armies; seconderrily, of"
9161,REBIRTH,"course, in search of our brigadier-uncle. Not finding him on the road,"
9162,REBIRTH,we ran about the grass looking for him. This took us to a great many
9163,REBIRTH,places in a short time. Ow 'eavenly that lilac did smell on top of that
9164,REBIRTH,first Down--stinkin' its blossomin' little heart out!'
9165,REBIRTH,
9166,REBIRTH,"'I 'adn't leesure to notice,' said Mr. Leggatt. 'The Downs were full o'"
9167,REBIRTH,"chalk-pits, and we'd no lights.'"
9168,REBIRTH,
9169,REBIRTH,'We 'ad the bicycle-lamp to look at the map by. Didn't you notice the
9170,REBIRTH,old lady at the window where we saw the man in the night-gown? I thought
9171,REBIRTH,"night-gowns as sleepin' rig was extinck, so to speak.'"
9172,REBIRTH,
9173,REBIRTH,"'I tell you I 'adn't leesure to notice,' Leggatt repeated."
9174,REBIRTH,
9175,REBIRTH,'That's odd. Then what might 'ave made you tell the sentry at the first
9176,REBIRTH,camp we found that you was the _Daily Express_ delivery-waggon?'
9177,REBIRTH,
9178,REBIRTH,"'You can't touch pitch without being defiled,' Leggatt answered. ''Oo"
9179,REBIRTH,told the officer in the bath we were umpires?'
9180,REBIRTH,
9181,REBIRTH,"'Well, he asked us. That was when we found the Territorial battalion"
9182,REBIRTH,"undressin' in slow time. It lay on the left flank o' the Blue Army, and"
9183,REBIRTH,"it cackled as it lay, too. But it gave us our position as regards the"
9184,REBIRTH,"respective armies. We wandered a little more, and at 11.7 P.M., not"
9185,REBIRTH,"having had a road under us for twenty minutes, we scaled the heights of"
9186,REBIRTH,something or other--which are about six hundred feet high. Here we
9187,REBIRTH,"'alted to tighten the lashings of the superstructure, and we smelt"
9188,REBIRTH,"leather and horses three counties deep all round. We was, as you might"
9189,REBIRTH,"say, in the thick of it.'"
9190,REBIRTH,
9191,REBIRTH,"'""Ah!"" says my Mr. Morshed. ""My 'orizon has indeed broadened. What a"
9192,REBIRTH,"little thing is an uncle, Mr. Pyecroft, in the presence o' these"
9193,REBIRTH,"glitterin' constellations! Simply ludicrous!"" he says, ""to waste a"
9194,REBIRTH,rocking-horse on an individual. We must socialise it. But we must get
9195,REBIRTH,"their 'eads up first. Touch off one rocket, if you please."""
9196,REBIRTH,
9197,REBIRTH,"'I touched off a green three-pounder which rose several thousand metres,"
9198,REBIRTH,"and burst into gorgeous stars. ""Reproduce the manoeuvre,"" he says, ""at"
9199,REBIRTH,"the other end o' this ridge--if it don't end in another cliff."" So we"
9200,REBIRTH,"steamed down the ridge a mile and a half east, and then I let Jules"
9201,REBIRTH,"touch off a pink rocket, or he'd ha' kissed me. That was his only way to"
9202,REBIRTH,"express his emotions, so to speak. Their heads come up then all around"
9203,REBIRTH,"us to the extent o' thousands. We hears bugles like cocks crowing below,"
9204,REBIRTH,and on the top of it a most impressive sound which I'd never enjoyed
9205,REBIRTH,"before because 'itherto I'd always been an inteegral part of it, so to"
9206,REBIRTH,say--the noise of 'ole armies gettin' under arms. They must 'ave
9207,REBIRTH,"anticipated a night attack, I imagine. Most impressive. Then we 'eard a"
9208,REBIRTH,"threshin'-machine. ""Tutt! Tutt! This is childish!"" says Lootenant"
9209,REBIRTH,"Morshed. ""We can't wait till they've finished cutting chaff for their"
9210,REBIRTH,horses. We must make 'em understand we're not to be trifled with.
9211,REBIRTH,"Expedite 'em with another rocket, Mr. Pyecroft."""
9212,REBIRTH,
9213,REBIRTH,"'""It's barely possible, sir,"" I remarks, ""that that's a searchlight"
9214,REBIRTH,"churnin' up,"" and by the time we backed into a providential chalk"
9215,REBIRTH,cutting (which was where our first tyre went pungo) she broke out to the
9216,REBIRTH,"northward, and began searching the ridge. A smart bit o' work.'"
9217,REBIRTH,
9218,REBIRTH,"''Twasn't a puncture. The inner tube had nipped because we skidded so,'"
9219,REBIRTH,Leggatt interrupted.
9220,REBIRTH,
9221,REBIRTH,"'While your Mr. Leggatt was effectin' repairs, another searchlight broke"
9222,REBIRTH,"out to the southward, and the two of 'em swept our ridge on both sides."
9223,REBIRTH,Right at the west end of it they showed us the ground rising into a
9224,REBIRTH,"hill, so to speak, crowned with what looked like a little fort. Morshed"
9225,REBIRTH,"saw it before the beams shut off. ""That's the key of the position!"" he"
9226,REBIRTH,"says. ""Occupy it at all hazards."""
9227,REBIRTH,
9228,REBIRTH,"'""I haven't half got occupation for the next twenty minutes,"" says your"
9229,REBIRTH,"Mr. Leggatt, rootin' and blasphemin' in the dark. Mark, now, 'ow"
9230,REBIRTH,"Morshed changed his tactics to suit 'is environment. ""Right!"" says he."
9231,REBIRTH,"""I'll stand by the ship. Mr. Pyecroft and Jules, oblige me by doubling"
9232,REBIRTH,along the ridge to the east with all the maroons and crackers you can
9233,REBIRTH,"carry without spilling. Read the directions careful for the maroons, Mr."
9234,REBIRTH,"Pyecroft, and touch them off at half-minute intervals. Jules represents"
9235,REBIRTH,"musketry an' maxim fire under your command. Remember, it's death or"
9236,REBIRTH,"Salisbury Gaol! Prob'ly both!"""
9237,REBIRTH,
9238,REBIRTH,"'By these means and some moderately 'ard runnin', we distracted 'em to"
9239,REBIRTH,"the eastward. Maroons, you may not be aware, are same as bombs, with the"
9240,REBIRTH,"anarchism left out. In confined spots like chalk-pits, they knock a"
9241,REBIRTH,four-point-seven silly. But you should read the directions before'and.
9242,REBIRTH,"In the intervals of the slow but well-directed fire of my cow-guns,"
9243,REBIRTH,"Jules, who had found a sheep-pond in the dark a little lower down, gave"
9244,REBIRTH,what you might call a cinematograph reproduction o' sporadic musketry.
9245,REBIRTH,"They was large size crackers, and he concluded with the dull, sickenin'"
9246,REBIRTH,thud o' blind shells burstin' on soft ground.'
9247,REBIRTH,
9248,REBIRTH,'How did he manage that?' I said.
9249,REBIRTH,
9250,REBIRTH,"'You throw a lighted squib into water and you'll see,' said Pyecroft."
9251,REBIRTH,"'Thus, then, we improvised till supplies was exhausted and the"
9252,REBIRTH,surrounding landscapes fair 'owled and 'ummed at us. The Jun or Service
9253,REBIRTH,might 'ave 'ad their doubts about the rockets but they couldn't overlook
9254,REBIRTH,our gunfire. Both sides tumbled out full of initiative. I told Jules no
9255,REBIRTH,"two flat-feet 'ad any right to be as happy as us, and we went back"
9256,REBIRTH,"along the ridge to the derelict, and there was our Mr. Morshed"
9257,REBIRTH,apostrophin' his 'andiwork over fifty square mile o' country with
9258,REBIRTH,"""Attend, all ye who list to hear!"" out of the Fifth Reader. He'd got as"
9259,REBIRTH,"far as ""And roused the shepherds o' Stonehenge, the rangers o' Beaulieu"""
9260,REBIRTH,"when we come up, and he drew our attention to its truth as well as its"
9261,REBIRTH,"beauty. That's rare in poetry, I'm told. He went right on to--""The red"
9262,REBIRTH,"glare on Skiddaw roused those beggars at Carlisle""--which he pointed out"
9263,REBIRTH,was poetic license for Leith Hill. This allowed your Mr. Leggatt time to
9264,REBIRTH,finish pumpin' up his tyres. I 'eard the sweat 'op off his nose.'
9265,REBIRTH,
9266,REBIRTH,"'You know what it is, sir,' said poor Leggatt to me."
9267,REBIRTH,
9268,REBIRTH,"'It warfted across my mind, as I listened to what was trarnspirin', that"
9269,REBIRTH,"it might be easier to make the mess than to wipe it up, but such"
9270,REBIRTH,considerations weighed not with our valiant leader.
9271,REBIRTH,
9272,REBIRTH,"'""Mr. Pyecroft,"" he says, ""it can't have escaped your notice that we"
9273,REBIRTH,"'ave one angry and 'ighly intelligent army in front of us, an' another"
9274,REBIRTH,'ighly angry and equally intelligent army in our rear. What 'ud you
9275,REBIRTH,"recommend?"""
9276,REBIRTH,
9277,REBIRTH,'Most men would have besought 'im to do a lateral glide while there was
9278,REBIRTH,"yet time, but all I said was: ""The rocking-horse isn't expended"
9279,REBIRTH,"yet, sir."""
9280,REBIRTH,
9281,REBIRTH,"'He laid his hand on my shoulder. ""Pye,"" says he, ""there's worse men"
9282,REBIRTH,"than you in loftier places. They shall 'ave it. None the less,"" he"
9283,REBIRTH,"remarks, ""the ice is undeniably packing."""
9284,REBIRTH,
9285,REBIRTH,'I may 'ave omitted to point out that at this juncture two large
9286,REBIRTH,"armies, both deprived of their night's sleep, was awake, as you might"
9287,REBIRTH,"say, and hurryin' into each other's arms. Here endeth the"
9288,REBIRTH,second chapter.'
9289,REBIRTH,
9290,REBIRTH,He filled his pipe slowly. The uncle had fallen asleep. Leggatt lit
9291,REBIRTH,another cigarette.
9292,REBIRTH,
9293,REBIRTH,'We then proceeded _ong automobile_ along the ridge in a westerly
9294,REBIRTH,direction towards the miniature fort which had been so kindly revealed
9295,REBIRTH,"by the searchlight, but which on inspection (your Mr. Leggatt bumped"
9296,REBIRTH,into an outlyin' reef of it) proved to be a wurzel-clump;
9297,REBIRTH,"_c'est-Ã -dire_, a parallelogrammatic pile of about three million"
9298,REBIRTH,"mangold-wurzels, brought up there for the sheep, I suppose. On all"
9299,REBIRTH,"sides, excep' the one we'd come by, the ground fell away moderately"
9300,REBIRTH,"quick, and down at the bottom there was a large camp lit up an' full of"
9301,REBIRTH,harsh words of command.
9302,REBIRTH,
9303,REBIRTH,"'""I said it was the key to the position,"" Lootenant Morshed remarks."
9304,REBIRTH,"""Trot out Persimmon!"" which we rightly took to read, ""Un-wrap the"
9305,REBIRTH,"rocking-horse."""
9306,REBIRTH,
9307,REBIRTH,"'""Houp la!"" says Jules in a insubordinate tone, an' slaps Persimmon on"
9308,REBIRTH,the flank.
9309,REBIRTH,
9310,REBIRTH,"'""Silence!"" says the Lootenant. ""This is the Royal Navy, not Newmarket"";"
9311,REBIRTH,and we carried Persimmon to the top of the mangel-wurzel clump
9312,REBIRTH,as directed.
9313,REBIRTH,
9314,REBIRTH,'Owing to the inequalities of the terrain (I _do_ think your Mr. Leggatt
9315,REBIRTH,might have had a spirit-level in his kit) he wouldn't rock free on the
9316,REBIRTH,"bed-plate, and while adjustin' him, his detachable tail fetched adrift."
9317,REBIRTH,Our Lootenant was quick to seize the advantage.
9318,REBIRTH,
9319,REBIRTH,"'""Remove that transformation,"" he says. ""Substitute one Roman candle."
9320,REBIRTH,"Gas-power is superior to manual propulsion."""
9321,REBIRTH,
9322,REBIRTH,'So we substituted. He arranged the _piÃ¨ce de resistarnce_ in the shape
9323,REBIRTH,"of large drums--not saucers, mark you--drums of coloured fire, with"
9324,REBIRTH,"printed instructions, at proper distances round Persimmon. There was a"
9325,REBIRTH,brief interregnum while we dug ourselves in among the wurzels by hand.
9326,REBIRTH,"Then he touched off the fires, _not_ omitting the Roman candle, and, you"
9327,REBIRTH,"may take it from me, all was visible. Persimmon shone out in his naked"
9328,REBIRTH,"splendour, red to port, green to starboard, and one white light at his"
9329,REBIRTH,"bows, as per Board o' Trade regulations. Only he didn't so much rock,"
9330,REBIRTH,"you might say, as shrug himself, in a manner of speaking, every time the"
9331,REBIRTH,candle went off. One can't have everything. But the rest surpassed our
9332,REBIRTH,highest expectations. I think Persimmon was noblest on the starboard or
9333,REBIRTH,"green side--more like when a man thinks he's seeing mackerel in hell,"
9334,REBIRTH,don't you know? And yet I'd be the last to deprecate the effect of the
9335,REBIRTH,"port light on his teeth, or that blood-shot look in his left eye. He"
9336,REBIRTH,knew there was something going on he didn't approve of. He
9337,REBIRTH,looked worried.'
9338,REBIRTH,
9339,REBIRTH,'Did you laugh?' I said.
9340,REBIRTH,
9341,REBIRTH,'I'm not much of a wag myself; nor it wasn't as if we 'ad time to allow
9342,REBIRTH,the spectacle to sink in. The coloured fires was supposed to burn ten
9343,REBIRTH,"minutes, whereas it was obvious to the meanest capacity that the Junior"
9344,REBIRTH,Service would arrive by forced marches in about two and a half. They
9345,REBIRTH,"grarsped our topical allusion as soon as it was across the foot-lights,"
9346,REBIRTH,"so to speak. They were quite chafed at it. Of course, 'ad we reflected,"
9347,REBIRTH,we might have known that exposin' illuminated rockin'-horses to an army
9348,REBIRTH,that was learnin' to ride on 'em partook of the nature of a _double
9349,REBIRTH,"entender_, as the French say--same as waggling the tiller lines at a man"
9350,REBIRTH,who's had a hanging in the family. I knew the cox of the
9351,REBIRTH,_Archimandrite's_ galley 'arf killed for a similar _plaisan-teree._ But
9352,REBIRTH,we never anticipated lobsters being so sensitive. That was why we
9353,REBIRTH,shifted. We could 'ardly tear our commandin' officer away. He put his
9354,REBIRTH,"head on one side, and kept cooin'. The only thing he 'ad neglected to"
9355,REBIRTH,provide was a line of retreat; but your Mr. Leggatt--an 'eroic soul in
9356,REBIRTH,"the last stage of wet prostration--here took command of the van, or,"
9357,REBIRTH,"rather, the rear-guard. We walked downhill beside him, holding on to the"
9358,REBIRTH,"superstructure to prevent her capsizing. These technical details,"
9359,REBIRTH,"'owever, are beyond me.' He waved his pipe towards Leggatt."
9360,REBIRTH,
9361,REBIRTH,"'I saw there was two deepish ruts leadin' down 'ill somewhere,' said"
9362,REBIRTH,"Leggatt. 'That was when the soldiers stopped laughin', and begun to"
9363,REBIRTH,run uphill.'
9364,REBIRTH,
9365,REBIRTH,"'Stroll, lovey, stroll!' Pyecroft corrected. 'The Dervish rush took"
9366,REBIRTH,place later.'
9367,REBIRTH,
9368,REBIRTH,'So I laid her in these ruts. That was where she must 'ave scraped her
9369,REBIRTH,silencer a bit. Then they turned sharp right--the ruts did--and then she
9370,REBIRTH,"stopped bonnet-high in a manure-heap, sir; but I'll swear it was all of"
9371,REBIRTH,"a one in three gradient. I think it was a barnyard. We waited there,'"
9372,REBIRTH,said Leggatt.
9373,REBIRTH,
9374,REBIRTH,"'But not for long,' said Pyecroft. 'The lights were towering out of the"
9375,REBIRTH,drums on the position we 'ad so valiantly abandoned; and the Junior
9376,REBIRTH,Service was escaladin' it _en masse_. When numerous bodies of 'ighly
9377,REBIRTH,trained men arrive simultaneous in the same latitude from opposite
9378,REBIRTH,"directions, each remarking briskly, ""What the 'ell did you do _that_"
9379,REBIRTH,"for?"" detonation, as you might say, is practically assured. They didn't"
9380,REBIRTH,ask for extraneous aids. If we'd come out with sworn affidavits of what
9381,REBIRTH,we'd done they wouldn't 'ave believed us. They wanted each other's
9382,REBIRTH,company exclusive. Such was the effect of Persimmon on their clarss
9383,REBIRTH,"feelings. Idol'try, _I_ call it! Events transpired with the utmost"
9384,REBIRTH,velocity and rapidly increasing pressures. There was a few remarks about
9385,REBIRTH,"Dicky Bridoon and mechanical horses, and then some one was smacked--hard"
9386,REBIRTH,by the sound--in the middle of a remark.'
9387,REBIRTH,
9388,REBIRTH,"'That was the man who kept calling for the Forty-fifth Dragoons,' said"
9389,REBIRTH,Leggatt. 'He got as far as Drag ...'
9390,REBIRTH,
9391,REBIRTH,"'Was it?' said Pyecroft dreamily. 'Well, he couldn't say they didn't"
9392,REBIRTH,"come. They all came, and they all fell to arguin' whether the Infantry"
9393,REBIRTH,should 'ave Persimmon for a regimental pet or the Cavalry should keep
9394,REBIRTH,him for stud purposes. Hence the issue was soon clouded with
9395,REBIRTH,"mangold-wurzels. Our commander said we 'ad sowed the good seed, and it"
9396,REBIRTH,was bearing abundant fruit. (They weigh between four and seven pounds
9397,REBIRTH,"apiece.) Seein' the children 'ad got over their shyness, and 'ad really"
9398,REBIRTH,"begun to play games, we backed out o' the pit and went down, by steps,"
9399,REBIRTH,"to the camp below, no man, as you might say, making us afraid. Here we"
9400,REBIRTH,"enjoyed a front view of the battle, which rolled with renewed impetus,"
9401,REBIRTH,owing to both sides receiving strong reinforcements every minute. All
9402,REBIRTH,"arms were freely represented; Cavalry, on this occasion only, acting in"
9403,REBIRTH,concert with Artillery. They argued the relative merits of horses
9404,REBIRTH,"_versus_ feet, so to say, but they didn't neglect Persimmon. The wounded"
9405,REBIRTH,rolling downhill with the wurzels informed us that he had long ago been
9406,REBIRTH,"socialised, and the smallest souvenirs were worth a man's life. Speaking"
9407,REBIRTH,"broadly, the Junior Service appeared to be a shade out of 'and, if I may"
9408,REBIRTH,venture so far. They did _not_ pay prompt and unhesitating obedience to
9409,REBIRTH,"the ""Retires"" or the ""Cease Fires"" or the ""For 'Eaven's sake come to"
9410,REBIRTH,"bed, ducky"" of their officers, who, I regret to say, were 'otly"
9411,REBIRTH,embroiled at the heads of their respective units.'
9412,REBIRTH,
9413,REBIRTH,'How did you find that out?' I asked.
9414,REBIRTH,
9415,REBIRTH,'On account of Lootenant Morshed going to the Mess tent to call on his
9416,REBIRTH,uncle and raise a drink; but all hands had gone to the front. We thought
9417,REBIRTH,"we 'eard somebody bathing behind the tent, and we found an oldish"
9418,REBIRTH,gentleman tryin' to drown a boy in knickerbockers in a horse-trough. He
9419,REBIRTH,"kept him under with a bicycle, so to speak. He 'ad nearly accomplished"
9420,REBIRTH,"his fell design, when we frustrated him. He was in a highly malleable"
9421,REBIRTH,"condition and full o' _juice de spree_. ""Arsk not what I am,"" he says."
9422,REBIRTH,"""My wife 'll tell me that quite soon enough. Arsk rather what I've"
9423,REBIRTH,"been,"" he says. ""I've been dinin' here,"" he says. ""I commanded 'em in"
9424,REBIRTH,"the Eighties,"" he says, ""and, Gawd forgive me,"" he says, sobbin'"
9425,REBIRTH,"'eavily, ""I've spent this holy evening telling their Colonel they was a"
9426,REBIRTH,"set of educated inefficients. Hark to 'em!"" We could, without strainin'"
9427,REBIRTH,ourselves; but how _he_ picked up the gentle murmur of his own corps in
9428,REBIRTH,"that on-the-knee party up the hill I don't know. ""They've marched and"
9429,REBIRTH,"fought thirty mile to-day,"" he shouts, ""and now they're tearin' the"
9430,REBIRTH,_intestines_ out of the Cavalry up yonder! They won't stop this side the
9431,REBIRTH,"gates o' Delhi,"" he says. ""I commanded their ancestors. There's nothing"
9432,REBIRTH,"wrong with the Service,"" he says, wringing out his trousers on his lap."
9433,REBIRTH,"""'Eaven pardon me for doubtin' 'em! Same old game--same young beggars."""
9434,REBIRTH,
9435,REBIRTH,"'The boy in the knickerbockers, languishing on a chair, puts in a claim"
9436,REBIRTH,"for one drink. ""Let him go dry,"" says our friend in shirt-tails. ""He's a"
9437,REBIRTH,reporter. He run into me on his filthy bicycle and he asked me if I
9438,REBIRTH,could furnish 'im with particulars about the mutiny in the Army. You
9439,REBIRTH,"false-'earted proletarian publicist,"" he says, shakin' his finger at"
9440,REBIRTH,"'im--for he was reelly annoyed--""I'll teach you to defile what you can't"
9441,REBIRTH,"comprebend! When my regiment's in a state o' mutiny, I'll do myself the"
9442,REBIRTH,honour of informing you personally. You particularly ignorant and very
9443,REBIRTH,"narsty little man,"" he says, ""you're no better than a dhobi's donkey! If"
9444,REBIRTH,"there wasn't dirty linen to wash, you'd starve,"" he says, ""and why I"
9445,REBIRTH,"haven't drowned you will be the lastin' regret of my life."""
9446,REBIRTH,
9447,REBIRTH,"'Well, we sat with 'em and 'ad drinks for about half-an-hour in front"
9448,REBIRTH,of the Mess tent. He'd ha' killed the reporter if there hadn't been
9449,REBIRTH,"witnesses, and the reporter might have taken notes of the battle; so we"
9450,REBIRTH,"acted as two-way buffers, in a sense. I don't hold with the Press"
9451,REBIRTH,"mingling up with Service matters. They draw false conclusions. Now, mark"
9452,REBIRTH,"you, at a moderate estimate, there were seven thousand men in the"
9453,REBIRTH,"fighting line, half of 'em hurt in their professional feelings, an' the"
9454,REBIRTH,"other half rubbin' in the liniment, as you might say. All due to"
9455,REBIRTH,"Persimmon! If you 'adn't seen it you wouldn't 'ave believed it. And yet,"
9456,REBIRTH,"mark you, not one single unit of 'em even resorted to his belt. They"
9457,REBIRTH,confined themselves to natural producks--hands and the wurzels. I
9458,REBIRTH,"thought Jules was havin' fits, till it trarnspired the same thought had"
9459,REBIRTH,"impressed him in the French language. He called it _incroyable_, I"
9460,REBIRTH,"believe. Seven thousand men, with seven thousand rifles, belts, and"
9461,REBIRTH,"bayonets, in a violently agitated condition, and not a ungenteel blow"
9462,REBIRTH,struck from first to last. The old gentleman drew our attention to it as
9463,REBIRTH,well. It was quite noticeable.
9464,REBIRTH,
9465,REBIRTH,'Lack of ammunition was the primerry cause of the battle ceasin'. A
9466,REBIRTH,"Brigade-Major came in, wipin' his nose on both cuffs, and sayin' he 'ad"
9467,REBIRTH,"'ad snuff. The brigadier-uncle followed. He was, so to speak, sneezin'."
9468,REBIRTH,We thought it best to shift our moorings without attractin' attention;
9469,REBIRTH,so we shifted. They 'ad called the cows 'ome by then. The Junior Service
9470,REBIRTH,"was going to bye-bye all round us, as happy as the ship's monkey when"
9471,REBIRTH,"he's been playin' with the paints, and Lootenant Morshed and Jules kept"
9472,REBIRTH,"bowin' to port and starboard of the superstructure, acknowledgin' the"
9473,REBIRTH,unstinted applause which the multitude would 'ave given 'em if they'd
9474,REBIRTH,"known the facts. On the other 'and, as your Mr. Leggatt observed, they"
9475,REBIRTH,might 'ave killed us.
9476,REBIRTH,
9477,REBIRTH,"'That would have been about five bells in the middle watch, say"
9478,REBIRTH,half-past two. A well-spent evening. There was but little to be gained
9479,REBIRTH,"by entering Portsmouth at that hour, so we turned off on the grass (this"
9480,REBIRTH,"was after we had found a road under us), and we cast anchors out at the"
9481,REBIRTH,stern and prayed for the day.
9482,REBIRTH,
9483,REBIRTH,'But your Mr. Leggatt he had to make and mend tyres all our watch below.
9484,REBIRTH,"It trarnspired she had been running on the rim o' two or three wheels,"
9485,REBIRTH,"which, very properly, he hadn't reported till the close of the action."
9486,REBIRTH,And that's the reason of your four new tyres. Mr. Morshed was of opinion
9487,REBIRTH,you'd earned 'em. Do you dissent?'
9488,REBIRTH,
9489,REBIRTH,"I stretched out my hand, which Pyecroft crushed to pulp. 'No, Pye,' I"
9490,REBIRTH,"said, deeply moved, 'I agree entirely. But what happened to Jules?'"
9491,REBIRTH,
9492,REBIRTH,'We returned him to his own Navy after breakfast. He wouldn't have kept
9493,REBIRTH,much longer without some one in his own language to tell it to. I don't
9494,REBIRTH,know any man I ever took more compassion on than Jules. 'Is sufferings
9495,REBIRTH,"swelled him up centimetres, and all he could do on the Hard was to kiss"
9496,REBIRTH,"Lootenant Morshed and me, _and_ your Mr. Leggatt. He deserved that much."
9497,REBIRTH,A cordial beggar.'
9498,REBIRTH,
9499,REBIRTH,"Pyecroft looked at the washed cups on the table, and the low sunshine"
9500,REBIRTH,on my car's back in the yard.
9501,REBIRTH,
9502,REBIRTH,"'Too early to drink to him,' he said. 'But I feel it just the same.'"
9503,REBIRTH,
9504,REBIRTH,"The uncle, sunk in his chair, snored a little; the canary answered with"
9505,REBIRTH,"a shrill lullaby. Pyecroft picked up the duster, threw it over the cage,"
9506,REBIRTH,"put his finger to his lips, and we tiptoed out into the shop, while"
9507,REBIRTH,Leggatt brought the car round.
9508,REBIRTH,
9509,REBIRTH,"'I'll look out for the news in the papers,' I said, as I got in."
9510,REBIRTH,
9511,REBIRTH,"'Oh, we short-circuited that! Nothing trarnspired excep' a statement to"
9512,REBIRTH,the effect that some Territorial battalions had played about with
9513,REBIRTH,turnips at the conclusion of the manoeuvres The taxpayer don't know all
9514,REBIRTH,he gets for his money. Farewell!'
9515,REBIRTH,
9516,REBIRTH,We moved off just in time to be blocked by a regiment coming towards the
9517,REBIRTH,station to entrain for London.
9518,REBIRTH,
9519,REBIRTH,"'Beg your pardon, sir,' said a sergeant in charge of the baggage, 'but"
9520,REBIRTH,would you mind backin' a bit till we get the waggons past?'
9521,REBIRTH,
9522,REBIRTH,"'Certainly,' I said. 'You don't happen to have a rocking-horse among"
9523,REBIRTH,"your kit, do you?'"
9524,REBIRTH,
9525,REBIRTH,"The rattle of our reverse drowned his answer, but I saw his eyes. One of"
9526,REBIRTH,"them was blackish-green, about four days old."

9579,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"This they permitting, he, emboldened thus,"

9648,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and before he was thirty he was heavily marked with it. He and a few
9649,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"friends had rearranged Heaven very comfortably, but the reorganisation"
9650,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"of Earth, which they called Society, was even greater fun. It demanded"
9651,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Work in the shape of many taxi-rides daily; hours of brilliant talk with
9652,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,brilliant talkers; some sparkling correspondence; a few silences (but on
9653,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the understanding that their own turn should come soon) while other
9654,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"people expounded philosophies; and a fair number of picture-galleries,"
9655,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"tea-fights, concerts, theatres, music-halls, and cinema shows; the whole"

9657,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Such strong days sent Frankwell Midmore back to his flat assured that he

9659,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and the New Order.
9660,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9661,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"His temperament, he said, led him more towards concrete data than"

9664,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,early attach himself to the Immoderate Left of his Cause in the capacity
9665,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,of an experimenter in Social Relations. And since the Immoderate Left

9668,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore's lot was far from contemptible.
9669,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9670,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"At that hour Fate chose to play with him. A widowed aunt, widely"

9672,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore's mother had ever been or desired to be, died and left him"

9674,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"denied the existence of death, naturally could not stoop to burial; but"
9675,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore had to leave London for the dank country at a season when Social
9676,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Regeneration works best through long, cushioned conferences, two by two,"
9677,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"after tea. There he faced the bracing ritual of the British funeral, and"
9678,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,was wept at across the raw grave by an elderly coffin-shaped female with

9684,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'So far as I can understand, she has left me between four and five"
9685,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"hundred a year. It all comes from Ther Land, as they call it down here."
9686,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"The unspeakable attorney, Sperrit, and a green-eyed daughter, who hums"
9687,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"to herself as she tramps but is silent on all subjects except ""huntin',"""
9688,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,insisted on taking me to see it. Ther Land is brown and green in
9689,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"alternate slabs like chocolate and pistachio cakes, speckled with"
9690,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,occasional peasants who do not utter. In case it should not be wet
9691,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,enough there is a wet brook in the middle of it. Ther House is by the
9692,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,brook. I shall look into it later. If there should be any little memento
9693,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"of Jenny that you care for, let me know. Didn't you tell me that"
9694,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,mid-Victorian furniture is coming into the market again? Jenny's old
9695,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,maid--it is called Rhoda Dolbie--tells me that Jenny promised it thirty
9696,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"pounds a year. The will does not. Hence, I suppose, the tears at the"
9697,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,funeral. But that is close on ten per cent of the income. I fancy Jenny
9698,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"has destroyed all her private papers and records of her _vie intime_,"
9699,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"if, indeed, life be possible in such a place. The Sperrit man told me"
9700,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,that if I had means of my own I might come and live on Ther Land. I
9701,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,didn't tell him how much I would pay not to! I cannot think it right
9702,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,that any human being should exercise mastery over others in the
9703,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"merciless fashion our tom-fool social system permits; so, as it is all"
9704,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"mine, I intend to sell it whenever the unholy Sperrit can find a"
9705,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,purchaser.'
9706,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9707,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"And he went to Mr. Sperrit with the idea next day, just before returning"
9708,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,to town.
9709,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9710,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Quite so,' said the lawyer. 'I see your point, of course. But the house"
9711,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,itself is rather old-fashioned--hardly the type purchasers demand
9712,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"nowadays. There's no park, of course, and the bulk of the land is let to"
9713,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"a life-tenant, a Mr. Sidney. As long as he pays his rent, he can't be"
9714,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"turned out, and even if he didn't'--Mr. Sperrit's face relaxed a"
9715,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,shade--'you might have a difficulty.'
9716,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9717,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'The property brings four hundred a year, I understand,' said Midmore."
9718,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9719,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Well, hardly--ha-ardly. Deducting land and income tax, tithes, fire"
9720,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"insurance, cost of collection and repairs of course, it returned two"
9721,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,hundred and eighty-four pounds last year. The repairs are rather a large
9722,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"item--owing to the brook. I call it Liris--out of Horace, you know.'"
9723,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9724,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore looked at his watch impatiently.
9725,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9726,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I suppose you can find somebody to buy it?' he repeated.
9727,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9728,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'We will do our best, of course, if those are your instructions. Then,"
9729,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"that is all except'--here Midmore half rose, but Mr. Sperrit's little"
9730,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"grey eyes held his large brown ones firmly--'except about Rhoda Dolbie,"
9731,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Mrs. Werf's maid. I may tell you that we did not draw up your aunt's
9732,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,last will. She grew secretive towards the last--elderly people often
9733,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"do--and had it done in London. I expect her memory failed her, or she"
9734,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,mislaid her notes. She used to put them in her spectacle-case.... My
9735,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"motor only takes eight minutes to get to the station, Mr. Midmore ..."
9736,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"but, as I was saying, whenever she made her will with _us_, Mrs. Werf"
9737,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"always left Rhoda thirty pounds per annum. Charlie, the wills!' A clerk"
9738,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,with a baldish head and a long nose dealt documents on to the table like
9739,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"cards, and breathed heavily behind Midmore. 'It's in no sense a legal"
9740,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"obligation, of course,' said Mr. Sperrit. 'Ah, that one is dated January"
9741,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the 11th, eighteen eighty-nine.'"
9742,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9743,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore looked at his watch again and found himself saying with no good
9744,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"grace: 'Well, I suppose she'd better have it--for the present at"
9745,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,any rate.'
9746,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9747,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,He escaped with an uneasy feeling that two hundred and fifty-four pounds
9748,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"a year was not exactly four hundred, and that Charlie's long nose"
9749,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"annoyed him. Then he returned, first-class, to his own affairs."
9750,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9751,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Of the two, perhaps three, experiments in Social Relations which he had"
9752,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"then in hand, one interested him acutely. It had run for some months and"
9753,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"promised most variegated and interesting developments, on which he dwelt"
9754,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,luxuriously all the way to town. When he reached his flat he was not
9755,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"well prepared for a twelve-page letter explaining, in the diction of the"
9756,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Immoderate Left which rubricates its I's and illuminates its T's, that"
9757,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the lady had realised greater attractions in another Soul. She
9758,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"re-stated, rather than pleaded, the gospel of the Immoderate Left as her"
9759,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"justification, and ended in an impassioned demand for her right to"
9760,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"express herself in and on her own life, through which, she pointed out,"
9761,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"she could pass but once. She added that if, later, she should discover"
9762,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore was 'essentially complementary to her needs,' she would tell him"
9763,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,so. That Midmore had himself written much the same sort of
9764,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,epistle--barring the hint of return--to a woman of whom his needs for
9765,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"self-expression had caused him to weary three years before, did not"
9766,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,assist him in the least. He expressed himself to the gas-fire in terms
9767,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,essential but not complimentary. Then he reflected on the detached
9768,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"criticism of his best friends and her best friends, male and female,"
9769,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,with whom he and she and others had talked so openly while their gay
9770,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"adventure was in flower. He recalled, too--this must have been about"
9771,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"midnight--her analysis from every angle, remote and most intimate, of"
9772,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the mate to whom she had been adjudged under the base convention which
9773,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"is styled marriage. Later, at that bad hour when the cattle wake for a"
9774,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"little, he remembered her in other aspects and went down into the hell"
9775,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"appointed; desolate, desiring, with no God to call upon. About eleven"
9776,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"o'clock next morning Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and"
9777,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Zophar the Naamathite called upon him 'for they had made appointment
9778,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,together' to see how he took it; but the janitor told them that Job had
9779,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"gone--into the country, he believed."
9780,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9781,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore's relief when he found his story was not written across his
9782,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"aching temples for Mr. Sperrit to read--the defeated lover, like the"
9783,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"successful one, believes all earth privy to his soul--was put down by"
9784,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Mr. Sperrit to quite different causes. He led him into a morning-room.
9785,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"The rest of the house seemed to be full of people, singing to a loud"
9786,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"piano idiotic songs about cows, and the hall smelt of damp cloaks."
9787,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9788,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It's our evening to take the winter cantata,' Mr. Sperrit explained."
9789,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It's ""High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire."" I hoped you'd come back."
9790,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"There are scores of little things to settle. As for the house, of"
9791,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"course, it stands ready for you at any time. I couldn't get Rhoda out of"
9792,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"it--nor could Charlie for that matter. She's the sister, isn't she, of"
9793,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the nurse who brought you down here when you were four, she says, to"
9794,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,recover from measles?'
9795,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9796,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Is she? Was I?' said Midmore through the bad tastes in his mouth.
9797,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'D'you suppose I could stay there the night?'
9798,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9799,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Thirty joyous young voices shouted appeal to some one to leave their
9800,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'pipes of parsley 'ollow--'ollow--'ollow!' Mr. Sperrit had to raise his
9801,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,voice above the din.
9802,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9803,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Well, if I asked you to stay _here_, I should never hear the last of it"
9804,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"from Rhoda. She's a little cracked, of course, but the soul of devotion"
9805,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"and capable of anything. _Ne sit ancillae_, you know.'"
9806,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9807,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Thank you. Then I'll go. I'll walk.' He stumbled out dazed and sick
9808,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"into the winter twilight, and sought the square house by the brook."
9809,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9810,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"It was not a dignified entry, because when the door was unchained and"
9811,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Rhoda exclaimed, he took two valiant steps into the hall and then"
9812,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,fainted--as men sometimes will after twenty-two hours of strong emotion
9813,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and little food.
9814,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9815,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I'm sorry,' he said when he could speak. He was lying at the foot of"
9816,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the stairs, his head on Rhoda's lap."
9817,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9818,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Your 'ome is your castle, sir,' was the reply in his hair. 'I smelt it"
9819,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,wasn't drink. You lay on the sofa till I get your supper.'
9820,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9821,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"She settled him in a drawing-room hung with yellow silk, heavy with the"
9822,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,smell of dead leaves and oil lamp. Something murmured soothingly in the
9823,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,background and overcame the noises in his head. He thought he heard
9824,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,horses' feet on wet gravel and a voice singing about ships and flocks
9825,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and grass. It passed close to the shuttered bay-window.
9826,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9827,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"But each will mourn his own, she saith,"
9828,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,And sweeter woman ne'er drew breath
9829,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Than my son's wife, Elizabeth ..."
9830,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Cusha--cusha--cusha--calling.
9831,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9832,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,The hoofs broke into a canter as Rhoda entered with the tray. 'And then
9833,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"I'll put you to bed,' she said. 'Sidney's coming in the morning.'"
9834,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore asked no questions. He dragged his poor bruised soul to bed and
9835,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"would have pitied it all over again, but the food and warm sherry and"
9836,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,water drugged him to instant sleep.
9837,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9838,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Rhoda's voice wakened him, asking whether he would have ''ip, foot, or"
9839,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"sitz,' which he understood were the baths of the establishment. 'Suppose"
9840,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you try all three,' she suggested. 'They're all yours, you know, sir.'"
9841,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9842,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"He would have renewed his sorrows with the daylight, but her words"
9843,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,struck him pleasantly. Everything his eyes opened upon was his very own
9844,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"to keep for ever. The carved four-post Chippendale bed, obviously worth"
9845,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,hundreds; the wavy walnut William and Mary chairs--he had seen worse
9846,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,ones labelled twenty guineas apiece; the oval medallion mirror; the
9847,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,delicate eighteenth-century wire fireguard; the heavy brocaded curtains
9848,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"were his--all his. So, too, a great garden full of birds that faced him"
9849,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"when he shaved; a mulberry tree, a sun-dial, and a dull, steel-coloured"
9850,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,brook that murmured level with the edge of a lawn a hundred yards away.
9851,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Peculiarly and privately his own was the smell of sausages and coffee
9852,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"that he sniffed at the head of the wide square landing, all set round"
9853,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,with mysterious doors and Bartolozzi prints. He spent two hours after
9854,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,breakfast in exploring his new possessions. His heart leaped up at such
9855,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"things as sewing-machines, a rubber-tyred bath-chair in a tiled passage,"
9856,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"a malachite-headed Malacca cane, boxes and boxes of unopened stationery,"
9857,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"seal-rings, bunches of keys, and at the bottom of a steel-net reticule a"
9858,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,little leather purse with seven pounds ten shillings in gold and eleven
9859,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,shillings in silver.
9860,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9861,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'You used to play with that when my sister brought you down here after
9862,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"your measles,' said Rhoda as he slipped the money into his pocket. 'Now,"
9863,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,this was your pore dear auntie's business-room.' She opened a low door.
9864,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, I forgot about Mr. Sidney! There he is.' An enormous old man with"
9865,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,rheumy red eyes that blinked under downy white eyebrows sat in an Empire
9866,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"chair, his cap in his hands. Rhoda withdrew sniffing. The man looked"
9867,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore over in silence, then jerked a thumb towards the door. 'I reckon"
9868,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"she told you who I be,' he began. 'I'm the only farmer you've got."
9869,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Nothin' goes off my place 'thout it walks on its own feet. What about my
9870,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,pig-pound?'
9871,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9872,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Well, what about it?' said Midmore."
9873,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9874,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'That's just what I be come about. The County Councils are getting more
9875,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,particular. Did ye know there was swine fever at Pashell's? There _be_.
9876,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,It'll 'ave to be in brick.'
9877,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9878,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Yes,' said Midmore politely."
9879,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9880,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I've bin at your aunt that was, plenty times about it. I don't say she"
9881,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"wasn't a just woman, but she didn't read the lease same way I did. I be"
9882,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"used to bein' put upon, but there's no doing any longer 'thout that"
9883,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,pig-pound.'
9884,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9885,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'When would you like it?' Midmore asked. It seemed the easiest road to
9886,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,take.
9887,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9888,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Any time or other suits me, I reckon. He ain't thrivin' where he is,"
9889,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,an' I paid eighteen shillin' for him.' He crossed his hands on his stick
9890,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and gave no further sign of life.
9891,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9892,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Is that all?' Midmore stammered.
9893,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9894,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'All now--excep''--he glanced fretfully at the table beside him--'excep'
9895,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,my usuals. Where's that Rhoda?'
9896,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9897,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore rang the bell. Rhoda came in with a bottle and a glass. The old
9898,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"man helped himself to four stiff fingers, rose in one piece, and stumped"
9899,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,out. At the door he cried ferociously: 'Don't suppose it's any odds to
9900,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you whether I'm drowned or not, but them floodgates want a wheel and"
9901,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"winch, they do. I be too old for liftin' 'em with the bar--my time"
9902,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,o' life.'
9903,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9904,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Good riddance if 'e was drowned,' said Rhoda. 'But don't you mind him."
9905,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,He's only amusin' himself. Your pore dear auntie used to give 'im 'is
9906,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,usual--'tisn't the whisky _you_ drink--an' send 'im about 'is business.'
9907,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9908,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I see. Now, is a pig-pound the same thing as a pig-sty?'"
9909,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9910,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Rhoda nodded. ''E needs one, too, but 'e ain't entitled to it. You look"
9911,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,at 'is lease--third drawer on the left in that Bombay cab'net--an' next
9912,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"time 'e comes you ask 'im to read it. That'll choke 'im off, because"
9913,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'e can't!'
9914,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9915,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,There was nothing in Midmore's past to teach him the message and
9916,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"significance of a hand-written lease of the late 'eighties, but Rhoda"
9917,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,interpreted.
9918,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9919,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It don't mean anything reelly,' was her cheerful conclusion, 'excep'"
9920,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you mustn't get rid of him anyhow, an' 'e can do what 'e likes always."
9921,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Lucky for us 'e _do_ farm; and if it wasn't for 'is woman--'
9922,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9923,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, there's a Mrs. Sidney, is there?'"
9924,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9925,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Lor, _no_!' The Sidneys don't marry. They keep. That's his fourth"
9926,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,since--to my knowledge. He was a takin' man from the first.'
9927,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9928,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Any families?'
9929,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9930,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'They'd be grown up by now if there was, wouldn't they? But you can't"
9931,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,spend all your days considerin' 'is interests. That's what gave your
9932,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,pore aunt 'er indigestion. 'Ave you seen the gun-room?'
9933,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9934,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore held strong views on the immorality of taking life for pleasure.
9935,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,But there was no denying that the late Colonel Werf's seventy-guinea
9936,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"breechloaders were good at their filthy job. He loaded one, took it out"
9937,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and pointed--merely pointed--it at a cock-pheasant which rose out of a
9938,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"shrubbery behind the kitchen, and the flaming bird came down in a long"
9939,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"slant on the lawn, stone dead. Rhoda from the scullery said it was a"
9940,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"lovely shot, and told him lunch was ready."
9941,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9942,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"He spent the afternoon gun in one hand, a map in the other, beating the"
9943,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"bounds of his lands. They lay altogether in a shallow, uninteresting"
9944,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"valley, flanked with woods and bisected by a brook. Up stream was his"
9945,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"own house; down stream, less than half a mile, a low red farm-house"
9946,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"squatted in an old orchard, beside what looked like small lock-gates on"
9947,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the Thames. There was no doubt as to ownership. Mr. Sidney saw him while
9948,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"yet far off, and bellowed at him about pig-pounds and floodgates. These"
9949,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"last were two great sliding shutters of weedy oak across the brook,"
9950,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,which were prised up inch by inch with a crowbar along a notched strip
9951,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"of iron, and when Sidney opened them they at once let out half the"
9952,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,water. Midmore watched it shrink between its aldered banks like some
9953,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"conjuring trick. This, too, was his very own."
9954,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9955,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I see,' he said. 'How interesting! Now, what's that bell for?' he went"
9956,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"on, pointing to an old ship's bell in a rude belfry at the end of an"
9957,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,outhouse. 'Was that a chapel once?' The red-eyed giant seemed to have
9958,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,difficulty in expressing himself for the moment and blinked savagely.
9959,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9960,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Yes,' he said at last. 'My chapel. When you 'ear that bell ring you'll"
9961,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'ear something. Nobody but me 'ud put up with it--but I reckon it don't
9962,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"make any odds to you.' He slammed the gates down again, and the brook"
9963,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,rose behind them with a suck and a grunt.
9964,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9965,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore moved off, conscious that he might be safer with Rhoda to hold"
9966,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,his conversational hand. As he passed the front of the farm-house a
9967,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"smooth fat woman, with neatly parted grey hair under a widow's cap,"
9968,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,curtsied to him deferentially through the window. By every teaching of
9969,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the Immoderate Left she had a perfect right to express herself in any
9970,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"way she pleased, but the curtsey revolted him. And on his way home he"
9971,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,was hailed from behind a hedge by a manifest idiot with no roof to his
9972,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"mouth, who hallooed and danced round him."
9973,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9974,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'What did that beast want?' he demanded of Rhoda at tea.
9975,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9976,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Jimmy? He only wanted to know if you 'ad any telegrams to send. 'E'll
9977,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,go anywhere so long as 'tisn't across running water. That gives 'im 'is
9978,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,seizures. Even talkin' about it for fun like makes 'im shake.'
9979,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9980,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'But why isn't he where he can be properly looked after?'
9981,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9982,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'What 'arm's 'e doing? E's a love-child, but 'is family can pay for 'im."
9983,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"If 'e was locked up 'e'd die all off at once, like a wild rabbit. Won't"
9984,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you, please, look at the drive, sir?'"
9985,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9986,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore looked in the fading light. The neat gravel was pitted with
9987,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"large roundish holes, and there was a punch or two of the same sort"
9988,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,on the lawn.
9989,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9990,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'That's the 'unt comin' 'ome,' Rhoda explained. 'Your pore dear auntie"
9991,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,always let 'em use our drive for a short cut after the Colonel died. The
9992,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Colonel wouldn't so much because he preserved; but your auntie was
9993,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,always an 'orsewoman till 'er sciatica.'
9994,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9995,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Isn't there some one who can rake it over or--or something?' said
9996,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore vaguely.
9997,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
9998,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh yes. You'll never see it in the morning, but--you was out when they"
9999,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,came 'ome an' Mister Fisher--he's the Master--told me to tell you with
10000,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'is compliments that if you wasn't preservin' and cared to 'old to the
10001,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"old understanding', is gravel-pit is at your service same as before. 'E"
10002,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"thought, perhaps, you mightn't know, and it 'ad slipped my mind to tell"
10003,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you. It's good gravel, Mister Fisher's, and it binds beautiful on the"
10004,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"drive. We 'ave to draw it, o' course, from the pit, but--'"
10005,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10006,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore looked at her helplessly.
10007,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10008,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Rhoda,' said he, 'what am I supposed to do?'"
10009,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10010,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, let 'em come through,' she replied. 'You never know. You may want"
10011,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,to 'unt yourself some day.'
10012,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10013,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"That evening it rained and his misery returned on him, the worse for"
10014,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,having been diverted. At last he was driven to paw over a few score
10015,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"books in a panelled room called the library, and realised with horror"
10016,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,what the late Colonel Werf's mind must have been in its prime. The
10017,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,volumes smelt of a dead world as strongly as they did of mildew. He
10018,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"opened and thrust them back, one after another, till crude coloured"
10019,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,illustrations of men on horses held his eye. He began at random and read
10020,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"a little, moved into the drawing-room with the volume, and settled down"
10021,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,by the fire still reading. It was a foul world into which he peeped for
10022,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the first time--a heavy-eating, hard-drinking hell of horse-copers,"
10023,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"swindlers, matchmaking mothers, economically dependent virgins selling"
10024,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"themselves blushingly for cash and lands: Jews, tradesmen, and an"
10025,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,ill-considered spawn of Dickens-and-horsedung characters (I give
10026,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore's own criticism), but he read on, fascinated, and behold, from"
10027,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the pages leaped, as it were, the brother to the red-eyed man of the"
10028,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"brook, bellowing at a landlord (here Midmore realised that _he_ was that"
10029,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"very animal) for new barns; and another man who, like himself again,"
10030,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,objected to hoof-marks on gravel. Outrageous as thought and conception
10031,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"were, the stuff seemed to have the rudiments of observation. He dug out"
10032,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"other volumes by the same author, till Rhoda came in with a silver"
10033,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,candlestick.
10034,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10035,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Rhoda,' said he, 'did you ever hear about a character called James"
10036,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Pigg--and Batsey?'
10037,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10038,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Why, o' course,' said she. 'The Colonel used to come into the kitchen"
10039,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,in 'is dressin'-gown an' read us all those Jorrockses.'
10040,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10041,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, Lord!' said Midmore, and went to bed with a book called _Handley"
10042,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Cross_ under his arm, and a lonelier Columbus into a stranger world the"
10043,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,wet-ringed moon never looked upon.
10044,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10045,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,*       *       *       *       *
10046,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10047,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Here we omit much. But Midmore never denied that for the epicure in
10048,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"sensation the urgent needs of an ancient house, as interpreted by Rhoda"
10049,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"pointing to daylight through attic-tiles held in place by moss, gives an"
10050,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,edge to the pleasure of Social Research elsewhere. Equally he found that
10051,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the reaction following prolonged research loses much of its grey terror
10052,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,if one knows one can at will bathe the soul in the society of plumbers
10053,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"(all the water-pipes had chronic appendicitis), village idiots (Jimmy"
10054,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,had taken Midmore under his weak wing and camped daily at the
10055,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"drive-gates), and a giant with red eyelids whose every action is an"
10056,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,unpredictable outrage.
10057,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10058,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Towards spring Midmore filled his house with a few friends of the
10059,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Immoderate Left. It happened to be the day when, all things and Rhoda"
10060,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"working together, a cartload of bricks, another of sand, and some bags"
10061,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,of lime had been despatched to build Sidney his almost daily-demanded
10062,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,pig-pound. Midmore took his friends across the flat fields with some
10063,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,idea of showing them Sidney as a type of 'the peasantry.' They hit the
10064,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"minute when Sidney, hoarse with rage, was ordering bricklayer, mate,"
10065,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,carts and all off his premises. The visitors disposed themselves
10066,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,to listen.
10067,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10068,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You never give me no notice about changin' the pig,' Sidney shouted."
10069,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,The pig--at least eighteen inches long--reared on end in the old sty and
10070,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,smiled at the company.
10071,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10072,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'But, my good man--' Midmore opened."
10073,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10074,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I ain't! For aught you know I be a dam' sight worse than you be. You
10075,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,can't come and be'ave arbit'ry with me. You _are_ be'avin' arbit'ry! All
10076,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,you men go clean away an' don't set foot on my land till I bid ye.'
10077,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10078,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'But you asked'--Midmore felt his voice jump up--'to have the pig-pound
10079,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,built.'
10080,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10081,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,''Spose I did. That's no reason you shouldn't send me notice to change
10082,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the pig. 'Comin' down on me like this 'thout warnin'! That pig's got to
10083,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,be got into the cowshed an' all.'
10084,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10085,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Then open the door and let him run in,' said Midmore."
10086,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10087,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Don't you be'ave arbit'ry with _me_! Take all your dam' men 'ome off my
10088,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,land. I won't be treated arbit'ry.'
10089,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10090,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"The carts moved off without a word, and Sidney went into the house and"
10091,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,slammed the door.
10092,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10093,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Now, I hold that is enormously significant,' said a visitor. 'Here you"
10094,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,have the logical outcome of centuries of feudal oppression--the frenzy
10095,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,of fear.' The company looked at Midmore with grave pain.
10096,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10097,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'But he _did_ worry my life out about his pig-sty,' was all Midmore"
10098,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,found to say.
10099,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10100,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Others took up the parable and proved to him if he only held true to the
10101,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,gospels of the Immoderate Left the earth would soon be covered with
10102,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'jolly little' pig-sties, built in the intervals of morris-dancing by"
10103,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'the peasant' himself.
10104,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10105,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore felt grateful when the door opened again and Mr. Sidney invited
10106,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"them all to retire to the road which, he pointed out, was public. As"
10107,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"they turned the corner of the house, a smooth-faced woman in a widow's"
10108,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,cap curtsied to each of them through the window.
10109,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10110,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Instantly they drew pictures of that woman's lot, deprived of all"
10111,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"vehicle for self-expression--'the set grey life and apathetic end,' one"
10112,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,quoted--and they discussed the tremendous significance of village
10113,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,theatricals. Even a month ago Midmore would have told them all that he
10114,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"knew and Rhoda had dropped about Sidney's forms of self-expression. Now,"
10115,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"for some strange reason, he was content to let the talk run on from"
10116,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,village to metropolitan and world drama.
10117,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10118,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Rhoda advised him after the visitors left that 'if he wanted to do that
10119,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,again' he had better go up to town.
10120,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10121,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'But we only sat on cushions on the floor,' said her master."
10122,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10123,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'They're too old for romps,' she retorted, 'an' it's only the beginning"
10124,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"of things. I've seen what _I've_ seen. Besides, they talked and laughed"
10125,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,in the passage going to their baths--such as took 'em.'
10126,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10127,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Don't be a fool, Rhoda,' said Midmore. No man--unless he has loved"
10128,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,her--will casually dismiss a woman on whose lap he has laid his head.
10129,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10130,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Very good,' she snorted, 'but that cuts both ways. An' now, you go down"
10131,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,to Sidney's this evenin' and put him where he ought to be. He was in his
10132,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"right about you givin' 'im notice about changin' the pig, but he 'adn't"
10133,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"any right to turn it up before your company. No manners, no pig-pound."
10134,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,He'll understand.'
10135,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10136,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore did his best to make him. He found himself reviling the old man
10137,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,in speech and with a joy quite new in all his experience. He wound
10138,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,up--it was a plagiarism from a plumber--by telling Mr. Sidney that he
10139,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"looked like a turkey-cock, had the morals of a parish bull, and need"
10140,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,never hope for a new pig-pound as long as he or Midmore lived.
10141,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10142,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Very good,' said the giant. 'I reckon you thought you 'ad something"
10143,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"against me, and now you've come down an' told it me like man to man."
10144,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Quite right. I don't bear malice. Now, you send along those bricks an'"
10145,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"sand, an' I'll make a do to build the pig-pound myself. If you look at"
10146,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,my lease you'll find out you're bound to provide me materials for the
10147,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,repairs. Only--only I thought there'd be no 'arm in my askin' you to do
10148,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,it throughout like.'
10149,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10150,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore fairly gasped. 'Then, why the devil did you turn my carts back"
10151,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,when--when I sent them up here to do it throughout for you?'
10152,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10153,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Mr. Sidney sat down on the floodgates, his eyebrows knitted in thought."
10154,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10155,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I'll tell you,' he said slowly. ''Twas too dam' like cheatin' a suckin'"
10156,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"baby. My woman, she said so too.'"
10157,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10158,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"For a few seconds the teachings of the Immoderate Left, whose humour is"
10159,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"all their own, wrestled with those of Mother Earth, who has her own"
10160,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,humours. Then Midmore laughed till he could scarcely stand. In due time
10161,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Mr. Sidney laughed too--crowing and wheezing crescendo till it broke
10162,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"from him in roars. They shook hands, and Midmore went home grateful that"
10163,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,he had held his tongue among his companions.
10164,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10165,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,When he reached his house he met three or four men and women on
10166,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"horse-back, very muddy indeed, coming down the drive. Feeling hungry"
10167,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"himself, he asked them if they were hungry. They said they were, and he"
10168,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"bade them enter. Jimmy took their horses, who seemed to know him. Rhoda"
10169,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"took their battered hats, led the women upstairs for hairpins, and"
10170,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"presently fed them all with tea-cakes, poached eggs, anchovy toast, and"
10171,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,drinks from a coromandel-wood liqueur case which Midmore had never known
10172,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,that he possessed.
10173,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10174,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'And I _will_ say,' said Miss Connie Sperrit, her spurred foot on the"
10175,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"fender and a smoking muffin in her whip hand, 'Rhoda does one top-hole."
10176,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,She always did since I was eight.'
10177,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10178,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Seven, Miss, was when you began to 'unt,' said Rhoda, setting down more"
10179,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,buttered toast.
10180,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10181,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'And so,' the M.F.H. was saying to Midmore, 'when he got to your brute"
10182,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Sidney's land, we had to whip 'em off. It's a regular Alsatia for 'em."
10183,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,They know it. Why'--he dropped his voice--'I don't want to say anything
10184,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"against Sidney as your tenant, of course, but I do believe the old"
10185,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,scoundrel's perfectly capable of putting down poison.'
10186,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10187,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Sidney's capable of anything,' said Midmore with immense feeling; but"
10188,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,once again he held his tongue. They were a queer community; yet when
10189,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"they had stamped and jingled out to their horses again, the house felt"
10190,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,hugely big and disconcerting.
10191,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10192,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,This may be reckoned the conscious beginning of his double life. It ran
10193,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"in odd channels that summer--a riding school, for instance, near Hayes"
10194,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Common and a shooting ground near Wormwood Scrubs. A man who has been
10195,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,saddle-galled or shoulder-bruised for half the day is not at his London
10196,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,best of evenings; and when the bills for his amusements come in he
10197,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,curtails his expenses in other directions. So a cloud settled on
10198,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore's name. His London world talked of a hardening of heart and a
10199,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,tightening of purse-strings which signified disloyalty to the Cause. One
10200,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"man, a confidant of the old expressive days, attacked him robustiously"
10201,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"and demanded account of his soul's progress. It was not furnished, for"
10202,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore was calculating how much it would cost to repave stables so
10203,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,dilapidated that even the village idiot apologised for putting visitors'
10204,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"horses into them. The man went away, and served up what he had heard of"
10205,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the pig-pound episode as a little newspaper sketch, calculated to annoy."
10206,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore read it with an eye as practical as a woman's, and since most of"
10207,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"his experiences had been among women, at once sought out a woman to whom"
10208,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,he might tell his sorrow at the disloyalty of his own familiar friend.
10209,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,She was so sympathetic that he went on to confide how his bruised
10210,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"heart--she knew all about it--had found so-lace, with a long O, in"
10211,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,another quarter which he indicated rather carefully in case it might be
10212,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,betrayed to other loyal friends. As his hints pointed directly towards
10213,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"facile Hampstead, and as his urgent business was the purchase of a horse"
10214,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"from a dealer, Beckenham way, he felt he had done good work. Later, when"
10215,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"his friend, the scribe, talked to him alluringly of 'secret gardens' and"
10216,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,those so-laces to which every man who follows the Wider Morality is
10217,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"entitled, Midmore lent him a five-pound note which he had got back on"
10218,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the price of a ninety-guinea bay gelding. So true it is, as he read in"
10219,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"one of the late Colonel Werf's books, that 'the young man of the present"
10220,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,day would sooner lie under an imputation against his morals than against
10221,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,his knowledge of horse-flesh.'
10222,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10223,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore desired more than he desired anything else at that moment to
10224,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"ride and, above all, to jump on a ninety-guinea bay gelding with black"
10225,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,points and a slovenly habit of hitting his fences. He did not wish many
10226,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"people except Mr. Sidney, who very kindly lent his soft meadow behind"
10227,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the floodgates, to be privy to the matter, which he rightly foresaw"
10228,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,would take him to the autumn. So he told such friends as hinted at
10229,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,country week-end visits that he had practically let his newly inherited
10230,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"house. The rent, he said, was an object to him, for he had lately lost"
10231,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"large sums through ill-considered benevolences. He would name no names,"
10232,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,but they could guess. And they guessed loyally all round the circle of
10233,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,his acquaintance as they spread the news that explained so much.
10234,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10235,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,There remained only one couple of his once intimate associates to
10236,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"pacify. They were deeply sympathetic and utterly loyal, of course, but"
10237,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,as curious as any of the apes whose diet they had adopted. Midmore met
10238,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"them in a suburban train, coming up to town, not twenty minutes after he"
10239,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,had come off two hours' advanced tuition (one guinea an hour) over
10240,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"hurdles in a hall. He had, of course, changed his kit, but his too heavy"
10241,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,bridle-hand shook a little among the newspapers. On the inspiration of
10242,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the moment, which is your natural liar's best hold, he told them that he"
10243,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,was condemned to a rest-cure. He would lie in semi-darkness drinking
10244,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"milk, for weeks and weeks, cut off even from letters. He was astonished"
10245,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and delighted at the ease with which the usual lie confounds the unusual
10246,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,intellect. They swallowed it as swiftly as they recommended him to live
10247,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,on nuts and fruit; but he saw in the woman's eyes the exact reason she
10248,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"would set forth for his retirement. After all, she had as much right to"
10249,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,express herself as he purposed to take for himself; and Midmore believed
10250,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,strongly in the fullest equality of the sexes.
10251,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10252,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,That retirement made one small ripple in the strenuous world. The lady
10253,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,who had written the twelve-page letter ten months before sent him
10254,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"another of eight pages, analysing all the motives that were leading her"
10255,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,back to him--should she come?--now that he was ill and alone. Much might
10256,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"yet be retrieved, she said, out of the waste of jarring lives and"
10257,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,piteous misunderstandings. It needed only a hand.
10258,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10259,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"But Midmore needed two, next morning very early, for a devil's"
10260,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"diversion, among wet coppices, called 'cubbing.'"
10261,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10262,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You haven't a bad seat,' said Miss Sperrit through the morning-mists."
10263,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'But you're worrying him.'
10264,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10265,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'He pulls so,' Midmore grunted."
10266,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10267,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Let him alone, then. Look out for the branches,' she shouted, as they"
10268,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,whirled up a splashy ride. Cubs were plentiful. Most of the hounds
10269,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,attached themselves to a straight-necked youngster of education who
10270,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,scuttled out of the woods into the open fields below.
10271,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10272,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Hold on!' some one shouted. 'Turn 'em, Midmore. That's your brute"
10273,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Sidney's land. It's all wire.'
10274,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10275,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, Connie, stop!' Mrs. Sperrit shrieked as her daughter charged at a"
10276,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,boundary-hedge.
10277,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10278,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Wire be damned! I had it all out a fortnight ago. Come on!' This was
10279,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore, buffeting into it a little lower down."
10280,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10281,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'_I_ knew that!' Connie cried over her shoulder, and she flitted across"
10282,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the open pasture, humming to herself."
10283,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10284,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, of course! If some people have private information, they can afford"
10285,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,to thrust.' This was a snuff-coloured habit into which Miss Sperrit had
10286,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,cannoned down the ride.
10287,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10288,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'What! 'Midmore got Sidney to heel? _You_ never did that, Sperrit.' This"
10289,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"was Mr. Fisher, M.F.H., enlarging the breach Midmore had made."
10290,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10291,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'No, confound him!' said the father testily. 'Go on, sir! _Injecto ter"
10292,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,pulvere_--you've kicked half the ditch into my eye already.'
10293,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10294,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,They killed that cub a little short of the haven his mother had told him
10295,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,to make for--a two-acre Alsatia of a gorse-patch to which the M.F.H. had
10296,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,been denied access for the last fifteen seasons. He expressed his
10297,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"gratitude before all the field and Mr. Sidney, at Mr. Sidney's"
10298,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,farm-house door.
10299,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10300,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'And if there should be any poultry claims--' he went on.
10301,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10302,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'There won't be,' said Midmore. 'It's too like cheating a sucking child,"
10303,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"isn't it, Mr. Sidney?'"
10304,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10305,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You've got me!' was all the reply. 'I be used to bein' put upon, but"
10306,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you've got me, Mus' Midmore.'"
10307,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10308,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore pointed to a new brick pig-pound built in strict disregard of
10309,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the terms of the life-tenant's lease. The gesture told the tale to the
10310,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"few who did not know, and they shouted."
10311,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10312,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Such pagan delights as these were followed by pagan sloth of evenings
10313,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,when men and women elsewhere are at their brightest. But Midmore
10314,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"preferred to lie out on a yellow silk couch, reading works of a debasing"
10315,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"vulgarity; or, by invitation, to dine with the Sperrits and savages of"
10316,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,their kidney. These did not expect flights of fancy or phrasing. They
10317,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"lied, except about horses, grudgingly and of necessity, not for art's"
10318,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"sake; and, men and women alike, they expressed themselves along their"
10319,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,chosen lines with the serene indifference of the larger animals. Then
10320,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore would go home and identify them, one by one, out of the"
10321,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"natural-history books by Mr. Surtees, on the table beside the sofa. At"
10322,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"first they looked upon him coolly, but when the tale of the removed wire"
10323,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"and the recaptured gorse had gone the rounds, they accepted him for a"
10324,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"person willing to play their games. True, a faction suspended judgment"
10325,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"for a while, because they shot, and hoped that Midmore would serve the"
10326,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,glorious mammon of pheasant-raising rather than the unkempt god of
10327,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"fox-hunting. But after he had shown his choice, they did not ask by what"
10328,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"intellectual process he had arrived at it. He hunted three, sometimes"
10329,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"four, times a week, which necessitated not only one bay gelding (Â£94:"
10330,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"10s.), but a mannerly white-stockinged chestnut (Â£114), and a black"
10331,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"mare, rather long in the back but with a mouth of silk (Â£150), who so"
10332,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,evidently preferred to carry a lady that it would have been cruel to
10333,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"have baulked her. Besides, with that handling she could be sold at a"
10334,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"profit. And besides, the hunt was a quiet, intimate, kindly little hunt,"
10335,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"not anxious for strangers, of good report in the _Field_, the servant of"
10336,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"one M.F.H., given to hospitality, riding well its own horses, and, with"
10337,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the exception of Midmore, not novices. But as Miss Sperrit observed,"
10338,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,after the M.F.H. had said some things to him at a gate: 'It _is_ a pity
10339,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you don't know as much as your horse, but you will in time. It takes"
10340,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,years and yee-ars. I've been at it for fifteen and I'm only just
10341,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,learning. But you've made a decent kick-off.'
10342,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10343,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"So he kicked off in wind and wet and mud, wondering quite sincerely why"
10344,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the bubbling ditches and sucking pastures held him from day to day, or"
10345,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,what so-lace he could find on off days in chasing grooms and
10346,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,brick-layers round outhouses.
10347,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10348,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"To make sure he up-rooted himself one week-end of heavy mid-winter rain,"
10349,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and re-entered his lost world in the character of Galahad fresh from a
10350,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"rest-cure. They all agreed, with an eye over his shoulder for the next"
10351,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"comer, that he was a different man; but when they asked him for the"
10352,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"symptoms of nervous strain, and led him all through their own, he"
10353,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,realised he had lost much of his old skill in lying. His three months'
10354,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"absence, too, had put him hopelessly behind the London field. The"
10355,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"movements, the allusions, the slang of the game had changed. The couples"
10356,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"had rearranged themselves or were re-crystallizing in fresh triangles,"
10357,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,whereby he put his foot in it badly. Only one great soul (he who had
10358,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,written the account of the pig-pound episode) stood untouched by the
10359,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"vast flux of time, and Midmore lent him another fiver for his integrity."
10360,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"A woman took him, in the wet forenoon, to a pronouncement on the Oneness"
10361,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"of Impulse in Humanity, which struck him as a polysyllabic _rÃ©sumÃ©_ of"
10362,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Mr. Sidney's domestic arrangements, plus a clarion call to 'shock"
10363,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,civilisation into common-sense.'
10364,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10365,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'And you'll come to tea with me to-morrow?' she asked, after lunch,"
10366,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,nibbling cashew nuts from a saucer. Midmore replied that there were
10367,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,great arrears of work to overtake when a man had been put away for
10368,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,so long.
10369,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10370,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'But you've come back like a giant refreshed.... I hope that
10371,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Daphne'--this was the lady of the twelve and the eight-page
10372,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"letter--'will be with us too. She has misunderstood herself, like so"
10373,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"many of us,' the woman murmured, 'but I think eventually ...' she flung"
10374,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"out her thin little hands. 'However, these are things that each lonely"
10375,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,soul must adjust for itself.'
10376,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10377,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Indeed, yes,' said Midmore with a deep sigh. The old tricks were"
10378,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,sprouting in the old atmosphere like mushrooms in a dung-pit. He passed
10379,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"into an abrupt reverie, shook his head, as though stung by tumultuous"
10380,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"memories, and departed without any ceremony of farewell to--catch a"
10381,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"mid-afternoon express where a man meets associates who talk horse, and"
10382,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"weather as it affects the horse, all the way down. What worried him most"
10383,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,was that he had missed a day with the hounds.
10384,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10385,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,He met Rhoda's keen old eyes without flinching; and the drawing-room
10386,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"looked very comfortable that wet evening at tea. After all, his visit to"
10387,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,town had not been wholly a failure. He had burned quite a bushel of
10388,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,letters at his flat. A flat--here he reached mechanically towards the
10389,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,worn volumes near the sofa--a flat was a consuming animal. As for
10390,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Daphne ... he opened at random on the words: 'His lordship then did as
10391,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,desired and disclosed a _tableau_ of considerable strength and variety.'
10392,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore reflected: 'And I used to think.... But she wasn't.... We were
10393,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,all babblers and skirters together.... I didn't babble much--thank
10394,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,goodness--but I skirted.' He turned the pages backward for more _Sortes
10395,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Surteesianae_, and read: 'When at length they rose to go to bed it"
10396,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"struck each man as he followed his neighbour upstairs, that the man"
10397,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,before him walked very crookedly.' He laughed aloud at the fire.
10398,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10399,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'What about to-morrow?' Rhoda asked, entering with garments over her"
10400,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,shoulder. 'It's never stopped raining since you left. You'll be
10401,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,plastered out of sight an' all in five minutes. You'd better wear your
10402,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"next best, 'adn't you? I'm afraid they've shrank. 'Adn't you best"
10403,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,try 'em on?'
10404,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10405,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Here?' said Midmore.
10406,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10407,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,''Suit yourself. I bathed you when you wasn't larger than a leg o'
10408,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"lamb,' said the ex-ladies'-maid."
10409,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10410,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Rhoda, one of these days I shall get a valet, and a married butler.'"
10411,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10412,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'There's many a true word spoke in jest. But nobody's huntin'
10413,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,to-morrow.'
10414,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10415,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Why? Have they cancelled the meet?'
10416,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10417,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'They say it only means slipping and over-reaching in the mud, and they"
10418,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,all 'ad enough of that to-day. Charlie told me so just now.'
10419,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10420,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Oh!' It seemed that the word of Mr. Sperrit's confidential clerk had
10421,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,weight.
10422,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10423,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Charlie came down to help Mr. Sidney lift the gates,' Rhoda continued."
10424,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10425,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'The floodgates? They are perfectly easy to handle now. I've put in a
10426,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,wheel and a winch.'
10427,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10428,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'When the brook's really up they must be took clean out on account of
10429,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the rubbish blockin' 'em. That's why Charlie came down.'
10430,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10431,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore grunted impatiently. 'Everybody has talked to me about that
10432,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,brook ever since I came here. It's never done anything yet.'
10433,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10434,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'This 'as been a dry summer. If you care to look now, sir, I'll get you"
10435,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,a lantern.'
10436,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10437,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,She paddled out with him into a large wet night. Half-way down the lawn
10438,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"her light was reflected on shallow brown water, pricked through with"
10439,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"grass blades at the edges. Beyond that light, the brook was strangling"
10440,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and kicking among hedges and tree-trunks.
10441,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10442,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'What on earth will happen to the big rose-bed?' was Midmore's first
10443,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,word.
10444,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10445,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'It generally 'as to be restocked after a flood. Ah!' she raised her
10446,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"lantern. 'There's two garden-seats knockin' against the sun-dial. Now,"
10447,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,that won't do the roses any good.'
10448,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10449,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'This is too absurd. There ought to be some decently thought-out
10450,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,system--for--for dealing with this sort of thing.' He peered into the
10451,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,rushing gloom. There seemed to be no end to the moisture and the racket.
10452,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,In town he had noticed nothing.
10453,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10454,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It can't be 'elped,' said Rhoda. 'It's just what it does do once in"
10455,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,just so often. We'd better go back.'
10456,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10457,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,All earth under foot was sliding in a thousand liquid noises towards
10458,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the hoarse brook. Somebody wailed from the house: ''Fraid o' the water!
10459,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Come 'ere! 'Fraid o' the water!'
10460,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10461,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'That's Jimmy. Wet always takes 'im that way,' she explained. The idiot"
10462,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"charged into them, shaking with terror."
10463,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10464,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Brave Jimmy! How brave of Jimmy! Come into the hall. What Jimmy got
10465,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,now?' she crooned. It was a sodden note which ran: 'Dear Rhoda--Mr.
10466,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Lotten, with whom I rode home this afternoon, told me that if this wet"
10467,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"keeps up, he's afraid the fish-pond he built last year, where Coxen's"
10468,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"old mill-dam was, will go, as the dam did once before, he says. If it"
10469,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"does it's bound to come down the brook. It may be all right, but perhaps"
10470,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,you had better look out. C.S.'
10471,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10472,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'If Coxen's dam goes, that means.... I'll 'ave the drawing-room carpet"
10473,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,up at once to be on the safe side. The claw-'ammer is in the libery.'
10474,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10475,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Wait a minute. Sidney's gates are out, you said?'"
10476,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10477,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Both. He'll need it if Coxen's pond goes.... I've seen it once.'
10478,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10479,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I'll just slip down and have a look at Sidney. Light the lantern again,"
10480,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"please, Rhoda.'"
10481,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10482,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'You won't get _him_ to stir. He's been there since he was born. But
10483,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,_she_ don't know anything. I'll fetch your waterproof and some
10484,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,top-boots.'
10485,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10486,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"''Fraid o' the water! 'Fraid o' the water!' Jimmy sobbed, pressed"
10487,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"against a corner of the hall, his hands to his eyes."
10488,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10489,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'All right, Jimmy. Jimmy can help play with the carpet,' Rhoda"
10490,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"answered, as Midmore went forth into the darkness and the roarings all"
10491,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,round. He had never seen such an utterly unregulated state of affairs.
10492,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,There was another lantern reflected on the streaming drive.
10493,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10494,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Hi! Rhoda! Did you get my note? I came down to make sure. I thought,"
10495,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"afterwards, Jimmy might funk the water!'"
10496,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10497,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It's me--Miss Sperrit,' Midmore cried. 'Yes, we got it, thanks.'"
10498,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10499,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You're back, then. Oh, good!... Is it bad down with you?'"
10500,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10501,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I'm going to Sidney's to have a look.'
10502,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10503,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'You won't get _him_ out. 'Lucky I met Bob Lotten. I told him he hadn't
10504,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,any business impounding water for his idiotic trout without
10505,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,rebuilding the dam.'
10506,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10507,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'How far up is it? I've only been there once.'
10508,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10509,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Not more than four miles as the water will come. He says he's opened
10510,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,all the sluices.'
10511,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10512,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"She had turned and fallen into step beside him, her hooded head bowed"
10513,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,against the thinning rain. As usual she was humming to herself.
10514,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10515,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Why on earth did you come out in this weather?' Midmore asked.
10516,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10517,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'It was worse when you were in town. The rain's taking off now. If it
10518,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"wasn't for that pond, I wouldn't worry so much. There's Sidney's bell."
10519,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Come on!' She broke into a run. A cracked bell was jangling feebly down
10520,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the valley.
10521,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10522,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Keep on the road!' Midmore shouted. The ditches were snorting
10523,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"bank-full on either side, and towards the brook-side the fields were"
10524,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,afloat and beginning to move in the darkness.
10525,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10526,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Catch me going off it! There's his light burning all right.' She halted
10527,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,undistressed at a little rise. 'But the flood's in the orchard. Look!'
10528,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,She swung her lantern to show a front rank of old apple-trees reflected
10529,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"in still, out-lying waters beyond the half-drowned hedge. They could"
10530,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"hear above the thud-thud of the gorged floodgates, shrieks in two keys"
10531,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,as monotonous as a steam-organ.
10532,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10533,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'The high one's the pig.' Miss Sperrit laughed.
10534,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10535,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'All right! I'll get _her_ out. You stay where you are, and I'll see you"
10536,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,home afterwards.'
10537,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10538,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'But the water's only just over the road,' she objected."
10539,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10540,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Never mind. Don't you move. Promise?'
10541,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10542,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'All right. You take my stick, then, and feel for holes in case"
10543,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,anything's washed out anywhere. This _is_ a lark!'
10544,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10545,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore took it, and stepped into the water that moved sluggishly as yet"
10546,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,across the farm road which ran to Sidney's front door from the raised
10547,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,and metalled public road. It was half way up to his knees when he
10548,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,knocked. As he looked back Miss Sperrit's lantern seemed to float in
10549,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,mid-ocean.
10550,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10551,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'You can't come in or the water'll come with you. I've bunged up all the
10552,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"cracks,' Mr. Sidney shouted from within. 'Who be ye?'"
10553,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10554,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Take me out! Take me out!' the woman shrieked, and the pig from his"
10555,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,sty behind the house urgently seconded the motion.
10556,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10557,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I'm Midmore! Coxen's old mill-dam is likely to go, they say. Come out!'"
10558,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10559,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I told 'em it would when they made a fish-pond of it. 'Twasn't ever
10560,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,puddled proper. But it's a middlin' wide valley. She's got room to
10561,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"spread.... Keep still, or I'll take and duck you in the cellar!... You"
10562,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"go 'ome, Mus' Midmore, an' take the law o' Mus' Lotten soon's you've"
10563,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,changed your socks.'
10564,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10565,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Confound you, aren't you coming out?'"
10566,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10567,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'To catch my death o' cold? I'm all right where I be. I've seen it
10568,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,before. But you can take _her_. She's no sort o' use or sense.... Climb
10569,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"out through the window. Didn't I tell you I'd plugged the door-cracks,"
10570,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you fool's daughter?' The parlour window opened, and the woman flung"
10571,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"herself into Midmore's arms, nearly knocking him down. Mr. Sidney leaned"
10572,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"out of the window, pipe in mouth."
10573,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10574,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Take her 'ome,' he said, and added oracularly:"
10575,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10576,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Two women in one house,"
10577,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Two cats an' one mouse,"
10578,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Two dogs an' one bone--
10579,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Which I will leave alone.
10580,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10581,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,I've seen it before.' Then he shut and fastened the window.
10582,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10583,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'A trap! A trap! You had ought to have brought a trap for me. I'll be
10584,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"drowned in this wet,' the woman cried."
10585,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10586,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Hold up! You can't be any wetter than you are. Come along!' Midmore
10587,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,did not at all like the feel of the water over his boot-tops.
10588,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10589,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Hooray! Come along!' Miss Sperrit's lantern, not fifty yards away,"
10590,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,waved cheerily.
10591,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10592,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"The woman threshed towards it like a panic-stricken goose, fell on her"
10593,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"knees, was jerked up again by Midmore, and pushed on till she collapsed"
10594,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,at Miss Sperrit's feet.
10595,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10596,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'But you won't get bronchitis if you go straight to Mr. Midmore's
10597,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"house,' said the unsympathetic maiden."
10598,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10599,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'O Gawd! O Gawd! I wish our 'eavenly Father 'ud forgive me my sins an'
10600,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"call me 'ome,' the woman sobbed. 'But I won't go to _'is_ 'ouse!"
10601,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,I won't.'
10602,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10603,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'All right, then. Stay here. Now, if we run,' Miss Sperrit whispered to"
10604,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore, 'she'll follow us. Not too fast!'"
10605,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10606,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"They set off at a considerable trot, and the woman lumbered behind them,"
10607,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"bellowing, till they met a third lantern--Rhoda holding Jimmy's hand."
10608,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"She had got the carpet up, she said, and was escorting Jimmy past the"
10609,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,water that he dreaded.
10610,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10611,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'That's all right,' Miss Sperrit pronounced. 'Take Mrs. Sidney back with"
10612,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"you, Rhoda, and put her to bed. I'll take Jimmy with me. You aren't"
10613,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"afraid of the water now, are you, Jimmy?'"
10614,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10615,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Not afraid of anything now.' Jimmy reached for her hand. 'But get away
10616,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,from the water quick.'
10617,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10618,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I'm coming with you,' Midmore interrupted."
10619,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10620,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'You most certainly are not. You're drenched. She threw you twice. Go
10621,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,home and change. You may have to be out again all night. It's only
10622,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,half-past seven now. I'm perfectly safe.' She flung herself lightly over
10623,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"a stile, and hurried uphill by the foot-path, out of reach of all but"
10624,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,the boasts of the flood below.
10625,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10626,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Rhoda, dead silent, herded Mrs. Sidney to the house."
10627,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10628,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You'll find your things laid out on the bed,' she said to Midmore as he"
10629,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,came up. I'll attend to--to this. _She's_ got nothing to cry for.'
10630,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10631,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Midmore raced into dry kit, and raced uphill to be rewarded by the sight"
10632,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,of the lantern just turning into the Sperrits' gate. He came back by way
10633,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"of Sidney's farm, where he saw the light twinkling across three acres of"
10634,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"shining water, for the rain had ceased and the clouds were stripping"
10635,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"overhead, though the brook was noisier than ever. Now there was only"
10636,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,that doubtful mill-pond to look after--that and his swirling world
10637,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,abandoned to himself alone.
10638,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10639,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'We shall have to sit up for it,' said Rhoda after dinner. And as the"
10640,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"drawing-room commanded the best view of the rising flood, they watched"
10641,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"it from there for a long time, while all the clocks of the house bore"
10642,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,them company.
10643,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10644,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"''Tisn't the water, it's the mud on the skirting-board after it goes"
10645,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"down that I mind,' Rhoda whispered. 'The last time Coxen's mill broke, I"
10646,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"remember it came up to the second--no, third--step o' Mr."
10647,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Sidney's stairs.'
10648,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10649,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'What did Sidney do about it?'
10650,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10651,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'He made a notch on the step. 'E said it was a record. Just like 'im.'
10652,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10653,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It's up to the drive now,' said Midmore after another long wait. 'And"
10654,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the rain stopped before eight, you know.'"
10655,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10656,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Then Coxen's dam _'as_ broke, and that's the first of the flood-water.'"
10657,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,She stared out beside him. The water was rising in sudden pulses--an
10658,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"inch or two at a time, with great sweeps and lagoons and a sudden"
10659,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,increase of the brook's proper thunder.
10660,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10661,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You can't stand all the time. Take a chair,' Midmore said presently."
10662,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10663,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Rhoda looked back into the bare room. 'The carpet bein' up _does_ make a
10664,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"difference. Thank you, sir, I _will_ 'ave a set-down.'"
10665,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10666,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"''Right over the drive now,' said Midmore. He opened the window and"
10667,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"leaned out. 'Is that wind up the valley, Rhoda?'"
10668,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10669,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'No, that's _it_! But I've seen it before.'"
10670,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10671,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,There was not so much a roar as the purposeful drive of a tide across a
10672,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"jagged reef, which put down every other sound for twenty minutes. A wide"
10673,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,sheet of water hurried up to the little terrace on which the house
10674,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"stood, pushed round either corner, rose again and stretched, as it were,"
10675,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"yawning beneath the moonlight, joined other sheets waiting for them in"
10676,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"unsuspected hollows, and lay out all in one. A puff of wind followed."
10677,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10678,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'It's right up to the wall now. I can touch it with my finger.' Midmore
10679,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,bent over the window-sill.
10680,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10681,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I can 'ear it in the cellars,' said Rhoda dolefully. 'Well, we've done"
10682,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,what we can! I think I'll 'ave a look.' She left the room and was absent
10683,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"half an hour or more, during which time he saw a full-grown tree"
10684,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,hauling itself across the lawn by its naked roots. Then a hurdle knocked
10685,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"against the wall, caught on an iron foot-scraper just outside, and made"
10686,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,a square-headed ripple. The cascade through the cellar-windows
10687,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,diminished.
10688,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10689,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It's dropping,' Rhoda cried, as she returned. 'It's only tricklin' into"
10690,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,my cellars now.'
10691,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10692,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Wait a minute. I believe--I believe I can see the scraper on the edge
10693,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,of the drive just showing!'
10694,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10695,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,In another ten minutes the drive itself roughened and became gravel
10696,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"again, tilting all its water towards the shrubbery."
10697,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10698,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'The pond's gone past,' Rhoda announced. 'We shall only 'ave the common"
10699,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,flood to contend with now. You'd better go to bed.'
10700,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10701,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I ought to go down and have another look at Sidney before daylight.'
10702,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10703,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'No need. You can see 'is light burnin' from all the upstairs windows.'
10704,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10705,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'By the way. I forgot about _her_. Where've you put her?'
10706,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10707,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'In my bed.' Rhoda's tone was ice. 'I wasn't going to undo a room for
10708,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,_that_ stuff.'
10709,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10710,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'But it--it couldn't be helped,' said Midmore. 'She was half drowned."
10711,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"One mustn't be narrow-minded, Rhoda, even if her position isn't"
10712,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,quite--er--regular.'
10713,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10714,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Pfff! I wasn't worryin' about that.' She leaned forward to the window.
10715,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'There's the edge of the lawn showin' now. It falls as fast as it rises.
10716,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Dearie'--the change of tone made Midmore jump--'didn't you know that I
10717,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,was 'is first? _That's_ what makes it so hard to bear.' Midmore looked
10718,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,at the long lizard-like back and had no words.
10719,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10720,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"She went on, still talking through the black window-pane:"
10721,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10722,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Your pore dear auntie was very kind about it. She said she'd make all
10723,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"allowances for one, but no more. Never any more.... Then, you didn't"
10724,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,know 'oo Charlie was all this time?'
10725,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10726,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Your nephew, I always thought.'"
10727,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10728,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Well, well,' she spoke pityingly. 'Everybody's business being nobody's"
10729,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"business, I suppose no one thought to tell you. But Charlie made 'is own"
10730,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"way for 'imself from the beginnin'!... But _her_ upstairs, she never"
10731,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"produced anything. Just an 'ousekeeper, as you might say. 'Turned over"
10732,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,an' went to sleep straight off. She 'ad the impudence to ask me for 'ot
10733,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,sherry-gruel.'
10734,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10735,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Did you give it to her,' said Midmore."
10736,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10737,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Me? Your sherry? No!'
10738,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10739,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"The memory of Sidney's outrageous rhyme at the window, and Charlie's"
10740,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,long nose (he thought it looked interested at the time) as he passed the
10741,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"copies of Mrs. Werf's last four wills, overcame Midmore without warning."
10742,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10743,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'This damp is givin' you a cold,' said Rhoda, rising. 'There you go"
10744,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,again! Sneezin's a sure sign of it. Better go to bed. You can't do any
10745,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"thin' excep''--she stood rigid, with crossed arms--'about me.'"
10746,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10747,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Well. What about you?' Midmore stuffed the handkerchief into his
10748,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,pocket.
10749,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10750,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Now you know about it, what are you goin' to do--sir?'"
10751,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10752,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,She had the answer on her lean cheek before the sentence was finished.
10753,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10754,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Go and see if you can get us something to eat, Rhoda. And beer.'"
10755,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10756,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I expec' the larder'll be in a swim,' she replied, 'but old bottled"
10757,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"stuff don't take any harm from wet.' She returned with a tray, all in"
10758,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"order, and they ate and drank together, and took observations of the"
10759,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,falling flood till dawn opened its bleared eyes on the wreck of what had
10760,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"been a fair garden. Midmore, cold and annoyed, found himself humming:"
10761,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10762,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'That flood strewed wrecks upon the grass,"
10763,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,That ebb swept out the flocks to sea.
10764,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10765,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"There isn't a rose left, Rhoda!"
10766,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10767,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,An awesome ebb and flow it was
10768,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,To many more than mine and me.
10769,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,But each will mourn his ...
10770,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10771,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,It'll cost me a hundred.'
10772,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10773,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Now we know the worst,' said Rhoda, 'we can go to bed. I'll lay on the"
10774,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,kitchen sofa. His light's burnin' still.'
10775,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10776,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'And _she_?'
10777,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10778,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Dirty old cat! You ought to 'ear 'er snore!'
10779,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10780,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"At ten o'clock in the morning, after a maddening hour in his own garden"
10781,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"on the edge of the retreating brook, Midmore went off to confront more"
10782,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"damage at Sidney's. The first thing that met him was the pig, snowy"
10783,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"white, for the water had washed him out of his new sty, calling on high"
10784,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"heaven for breakfast. The front door had been forced open, and the flood"
10785,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,had registered its own height in a brown dado on the walls. Midmore
10786,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,chased the pig out and called up the stairs.
10787,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10788,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I be abed o' course. Which step 'as she rose to?' Sidney cried from
10789,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,above. 'The fourth? Then it's beat all records. Come up.'
10790,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10791,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Are you ill?' Midmore asked as he entered the room. The red eyelids
10792,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"blinked cheerfully. Mr. Sidney, beneath a sumptuous patch-work quilt,"
10793,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,was smoking.
10794,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10795,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Nah! I'm only thankin' God I ain't my own landlord. Take that cheer.
10796,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,What's she done?'
10797,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10798,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'It hasn't gone down enough for me to make sure.'
10799,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10800,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Them floodgates o' yourn'll be middlin' far down the brook by now; an'
10801,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"your rose-garden have gone after 'em. I saved my chickens, though. You'd"
10802,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,better get Mus' Sperrit to take the law o' Lotten an' 'is fish-pond.'
10803,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10804,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'No, thanks. I've trouble enough without that.'"
10805,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10806,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Hev ye?' Mr. Sidney grinned. 'How did ye make out with those two women
10807,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,o' mine last night? I lay they fought.'
10808,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10809,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'You infernal old scoundrel!' Midmore laughed.
10810,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10811,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I be--an' then again I bain't,' was the placid answer. 'But, Rhoda,"
10812,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"_she_ wouldn't ha' left me last night. Fire or flood, she wouldn't.'"
10813,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10814,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Why didn't you ever marry her?' Midmore asked.
10815,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10816,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Waste of good money. She was willin' without.'
10817,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10818,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"There was a step on the gritty mud below, and a voice humming. Midmore"
10819,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"rose quickly saying: 'Well, I suppose you're all right now.'"
10820,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10821,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I be. I ain't a landlord, nor I ain't young--nor anxious. Oh, Mus'"
10822,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore! Would it make any odds about her thirty pounds comin' regular
10823,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,if I married her? Charlie said maybe 'twould.'
10824,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10825,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Did he?' Midmore turned at the door. 'And what did Jimmy say about it?'
10826,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10827,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Jimmy?' Mr. Sidney chuckled as the joke took him. 'Oh, _he's_ none o'"
10828,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,mine. He's Charlie's look-out.'
10829,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10830,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,Midmore slammed the door and ran downstairs.
10831,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10832,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Well, this is a--sweet--mess,' said Miss Sperrit in shortest skirts and"
10833,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"heaviest riding-boots. 'I had to come down and have a look at it. ""The"
10834,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"old mayor climbed the belfry tower."" 'Been up all night nursing"
10835,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,your family?'
10836,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10837,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Nearly that! Isn't it cheerful?' He pointed through the door to the
10838,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,stairs with small twig-drift on the last three treads.
10839,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10840,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It's a record, though,' said she, and hummed to herself:"
10841,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10842,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'That flood strewed wrecks upon the grass,"
10843,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,That ebb swept out the flocks to sea.'
10844,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10845,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You're always singing that, aren't you?' Midmore said suddenly as she"
10846,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,passed into the parlour where slimy chairs had been stranded at
10847,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,all angles.
10848,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10849,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Am I? Now I come to think of it I believe I do. They say I always hum
10850,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,when I ride. Have you noticed it?'
10851,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10852,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Of course I have. I notice every--'
10853,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10854,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh,' she went on hurriedly. 'We had it for the village cantata last"
10855,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"winter--""The Brides of Enderby.""'"
10856,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10857,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'No! ""High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire.""' For some reason Midmore"
10858,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,spoke sharply.
10859,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10860,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Just like that.' She pointed to the befouled walls. 'I say.... Let's
10861,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,get this furniture a little straight.... You know it too?'
10862,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10863,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Every word, since you sang it of course.'"
10864,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10865,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'When?'
10866,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10867,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'The first night I ever came down. You rode past the drawing-room window
10868,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"in the dark singing it--""And sweeter woman--""'"
10869,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10870,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I thought the house was empty then. Your aunt always let us use that
10871,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,short cut. Ha-hadn't we better get this out into the passage? It'll all
10872,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,have to come out anyhow. You take the other side.' They began to lift a
10873,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,heavyish table. Their words came jerkily between gasps and their faces
10874,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,were as white as--a newly washed and very hungry pig.
10875,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10876,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Look out!' Midmore shouted. His legs were whirled from under him, as"
10877,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"the table, grunting madly, careened and knocked the girl out of sight."
10878,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10879,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,The wild boar of Asia could not have cut down a couple more
10880,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"scientifically, but this little pig lacked his ancestor's nerve and fled"
10881,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,shrieking over their bodies.
10882,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10883,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Are you hurt, darling?' was Midmore's first word, and 'No--I'm only"
10884,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"winded--dear,' was Miss Sperrit's, as he lifted her out of her corner,"
10885,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,her hat over one eye and her right cheek a smear of mud.
10886,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10887,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,They fed him a little later on some chicken-feed that they found in
10888,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Sidney's quiet barn, a pail of buttermilk out of the dairy, and a"
10889,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,quantity of onions from a shelf in the back-kitchen.
10890,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10891,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Seed-onions, most likely,' said Connie. 'You'll hear about this.'"
10892,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10893,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'What does it matter? They ought to have been gilded. We must buy him.'
10894,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10895,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'And keep him as long as he lives,' she agreed. 'But I think I ought to"
10896,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"go home now. You see, when I came out I didn't expect ... Did you?'"
10897,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10898,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'No! Yes.... It had to come.... But if any one had told me an hour
10899,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,ago!... Sidney's unspeakable parlour--and the mud on the carpet.'
10900,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10901,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, I say! Is my cheek clean now?'"
10902,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10903,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Not quite. Lend me your hanky again a minute, darling.... What a purler"
10904,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,you came!'
10905,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10906,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'You can't talk. 'Remember when your chin hit that table and you said
10907,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"""blast""! I was just going to laugh.'"
10908,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10909,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'You didn't laugh when I picked you up. You were going ""oo-oo-oo"" like a"
10910,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,little owl.'
10911,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10912,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'My dear child--'
10913,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10914,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'Say that again!'
10915,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10916,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'My dear child. (Do you really like it? I keep it for my best friends.)
10917,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"My _dee-ar_ child, I thought I was going to be sick there and then. He"
10918,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,knocked every ounce of wind out of me--the angel! But I must really go.'
10919,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10920,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"They set off together, very careful not to join hands or take arms."
10921,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10922,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Not across the fields,' said Midmore at the stile. 'Come round by--by"
10923,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,your own place.'
10924,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10925,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,She flushed indignantly.
10926,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10927,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'It will be yours in a little time,' he went on, shaken with his own"
10928,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,audacity.
10929,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10930,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Not so much of your little times, if you please!' She shied like a colt"
10931,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"across the road; then instantly, like a colt, her eyes lit with new"
10932,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,curiosity as she came in sight of the drive-gates.
10933,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10934,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'And not quite so much of your airs and graces, Madam,' Midmore"
10935,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"returned, 'or I won't let you use our drive as a short cut any more.'"
10936,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10937,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'Oh, I'll be good. I'll be good.' Her voice changed suddenly. 'I swear"
10938,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"I'll try to be good, dear. I'm not much of a thing at the best. What"
10939,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,made _you_....'
10940,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10941,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,'I'm worse--worse! Miles and oceans worse. But what does it matter now?'
10942,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10943,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,They halted beside the gate-pillars.
10944,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10945,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"'I see!' she said, looking up the sodden carriage sweep to the front"
10946,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,door porch where Rhoda was slapping a wet mat to and fro. '_I_ see....
10947,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,"Now, I really must go home. No! Don't you come. I must speak to Mother"
10948,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,first all by myself.'
10949,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,
10950,THE LEGEND OF MIRTH,He watched her up the hill till she was out of sight.

11050,AL KORAN.,AL KORAN.
11051,AL KORAN.,
11052,AL KORAN.,"I have, to my grief and loss, suppressed several notable stories of my"
11053,AL KORAN.,"friend, the Hon. A.M. Penfentenyou[8], once Minister of Woods and"
11054,AL KORAN.,"Waysides in De Thouar's first administration; later, Premier in all but"
11055,AL KORAN.,"name of one of Our great and growing Dominions; and now, as always, the"
11056,AL KORAN.,"idol of his own Province, which is two and one-half the size of England."
11057,AL KORAN.,
11058,AL KORAN.,"[Footnote 8: See 'The Puzzler,' _Actions and Reactions_.]"
11059,AL KORAN.,
11060,AL KORAN.,For this reason I hold myself at liberty to deal with some portion of
11061,AL KORAN.,the truth concerning Penfentenyou's latest visit to Our shores. He
11062,AL KORAN.,"arrived at my house by car, on a hot summer day, in a white waistcoat"
11063,AL KORAN.,"and spats, sweeping black frock-coat and glistening top-hat--a little"
11064,AL KORAN.,"rounded, perhaps, at the edges, but agile as ever in mind and body."
11065,AL KORAN.,
11066,AL KORAN.,"'What is the trouble now?' I asked, for the last time we had met,"
11067,AL KORAN.,Penfentenyou was floating a three-million pound loan for his beloved but
11068,AL KORAN.,"unscrupulous Province, and I did not wish to entertain any more of his"
11069,AL KORAN.,financial friends.
11070,AL KORAN.,
11071,AL KORAN.,"'We,' Penfentenyou replied ambassadorially, 'have come to have a Voice"
11072,AL KORAN.,"in Your Councils. By the way, the Voice is coming down on the evening"
11073,AL KORAN.,train with my Agent-General. I thought you wouldn't mind if I invited
11074,AL KORAN.,'em. You know We're going to share Your burdens henceforward. You'd
11075,AL KORAN.,better get into training.'
11076,AL KORAN.,
11077,AL KORAN.,"'Certainly,' I replied. 'What's the Voice like?'"
11078,AL KORAN.,
11079,AL KORAN.,"'He's in earnest,' said Penfentenyou. 'He's got It, and he's got It bad."
11080,AL KORAN.,"He'll give It to you,' he said."
11081,AL KORAN.,
11082,AL KORAN.,'What's his name?'
11083,AL KORAN.,
11084,AL KORAN.,"'We call him all sorts of names, but I think you'd better call him Mr."
11085,AL KORAN.,Lingnam. You won't have to do it more than once.'
11086,AL KORAN.,
11087,AL KORAN.,'What's he suffering from?'
11088,AL KORAN.,
11089,AL KORAN.,'The Empire. He's pretty nearly cured us all of Imperialism at home.
11090,AL KORAN.,P'raps he'll cure you.'
11091,AL KORAN.,
11092,AL KORAN.,'Very good. What am I to do with him?'
11093,AL KORAN.,
11094,AL KORAN.,"'Don't you worry,' said Penfentenyou. 'He'll do it.'"
11095,AL KORAN.,
11096,AL KORAN.,And when Mr. Lingnam appeared half-an-hour later with the Agent-General
11097,AL KORAN.,"for Penfentenyou's Dominion, he did just that."
11098,AL KORAN.,
11099,AL KORAN.,He advanced across the lawn eloquent as all the tides. He said he had
11100,AL KORAN.,been observing to the Agent-General that it was both politically immoral
11101,AL KORAN.,and strategically unsound that forty-four million people should bear the
11102,AL KORAN.,"entire weight of the defences of Our mighty Empire, but, as he had"
11103,AL KORAN.,"observed (here the Agent-General evaporated), we stood now upon the"
11104,AL KORAN.,threshold of a new era in which the self-governing _and_ self-respecting
11105,AL KORAN.,"(bis) Dominions would rightly and righteously, as co-partners in Empery,"
11106,AL KORAN.,shoulder their share of any burden which the Pan-Imperial Council of
11107,AL KORAN.,the Future should allot. The Agent-General was already arranging for
11108,AL KORAN.,drinks with Penfentenyou at the other end of the garden. Mr. Lingnam
11109,AL KORAN.,swept me on to the most remote bench and settled to his theme.
11110,AL KORAN.,
11111,AL KORAN.,We dined at eight. At nine Mr. Lingnam was only drawing abreast of
11112,AL KORAN.,"things Imperial. At ten the Agent-General, who earns his salary, was"
11113,AL KORAN.,shamelessly dozing on the sofa. At eleven he and Penfentenyou went to
11114,AL KORAN.,bed. At midnight Mr. Lingnam brought down his big-bellied despatch box
11115,AL KORAN.,with the newspaper clippings and set to federating the Empire in
11116,AL KORAN.,earnest. I remember that he had three alternative plans. As a dealer in
11117,AL KORAN.,"words, I plumped for the resonant third--'Reciprocally co-ordinated"
11118,AL KORAN.,Senatorial Hegemony'--which he then elaborated in detail for
11119,AL KORAN.,three-quarters of an hour. At half-past one he urged me to have faith
11120,AL KORAN.,and to remember that nothing mattered except the Idea. Then he retired
11121,AL KORAN.,"to his room, accompanied by one glass of cold water, and I went into the"
11122,AL KORAN.,dawn-lit garden and prayed to any Power that might be off duty for the
11123,AL KORAN.,"blood of Mr. Lingnam, Penfentenyou, and the Agent-General."
11124,AL KORAN.,
11125,AL KORAN.,"To me, as I have often observed elsewhere, the hour of earliest dawn is"
11126,AL KORAN.,"fortunate, and the wind that runs before it has ever been my most"
11127,AL KORAN.,comfortable counsellor.
11128,AL KORAN.,
11129,AL KORAN.,"'Wait!' it said, all among the night's expectant rosebuds. 'To-morrow is"
11130,AL KORAN.,also a day. Wait upon the Event!'
11131,AL KORAN.,
11132,AL KORAN.,I went to bed so at peace with God and Man and Guest that when I waked I
11133,AL KORAN.,"visited Mr. Lingnam in pyjamas, and he talked to me Pan-Imperially for"
11134,AL KORAN.,"half-an-hour before his bath. Later, the Agent-General said he had"
11135,AL KORAN.,"letters to write, and Penfentenyou invented a Cabinet crisis in his"
11136,AL KORAN.,adored Dominion which would keep him busy with codes and cables all the
11137,AL KORAN.,"forenoon. But I said firmly, 'Mr. Lingnam wishes to see a little of the"
11138,AL KORAN.,country round here. You are coming with us in your own car.'
11139,AL KORAN.,
11140,AL KORAN.,"'It's a hired one,' Penfentenyou objected."
11141,AL KORAN.,
11142,AL KORAN.,"'Yes. Paid for by me as a taxpayer,' I replied."
11143,AL KORAN.,
11144,AL KORAN.,"'And yours has a top, and the weather looks thundery,' said the"
11145,AL KORAN.,Agent-General. 'Ours hasn't a wind-screen. Even our goggles were hired.'
11146,AL KORAN.,
11147,AL KORAN.,"'I'll lend you goggles,' I said. 'My car is under repairs.'"
11148,AL KORAN.,
11149,AL KORAN.,The hireling who had looked to be returned to London spat and growled on
11150,AL KORAN.,"the drive. She was an open car, capable of some eighteen miles on the"
11151,AL KORAN.,"flat, with tetanic gears and a perpetual palsy."
11152,AL KORAN.,
11153,AL KORAN.,"'It won't make the least difference,' sighed the Agent-General. 'He'll"
11154,AL KORAN.,only raise his voice. He did it all the way coming down.'
11155,AL KORAN.,
11156,AL KORAN.,"'I say,' said Penfentenyou suspiciously, 'what are you doing all this"
11157,AL KORAN.,_for_?'
11158,AL KORAN.,
11159,AL KORAN.,"'Love of the Empire,' I answered, as Mr. Lingnam tripped up in dust-coat"
11160,AL KORAN.,"and binoculars. 'Now, Mr. Lingnam will tell us exactly what he wants to"
11161,AL KORAN.,see. He probably knows more about England than the rest of us put
11162,AL KORAN.,together.'
11163,AL KORAN.,
11164,AL KORAN.,"'I read it up yesterday,' said Mr. Lingnam simply. While we stowed the"
11165,AL KORAN.,lunch-basket (one can never make too sure with a hired car) he outlined
11166,AL KORAN.,a very pretty and instructive little day's run.
11167,AL KORAN.,
11168,AL KORAN.,"'You'll drive, of course?' said Penfentenyou to him. 'It's the only"
11169,AL KORAN.,thing you know anything about.'
11170,AL KORAN.,
11171,AL KORAN.,"This astonished me, for your greater Federationists are rarely"
11172,AL KORAN.,"mechanicians, but Mr. Lingnam said he would prefer to be inside for the"
11173,AL KORAN.,present and enjoy our conversation.
11174,AL KORAN.,
11175,AL KORAN.,"Well settled on the back seat, he did not once lift his eyes to the"
11176,AL KORAN.,"mellow landscape around him, or throw a word at the life of the English"
11177,AL KORAN.,road which to me is one renewed and unreasoned orgy of delight. The
11178,AL KORAN.,mustard-coloured scouts of the Automobile Association; their natural
11179,AL KORAN.,"enemies, the unjust police; our natural enemies, the deliberate"
11180,AL KORAN.,"market-day cattle, broadside-on at all corners, the bicycling"
11181,AL KORAN.,"butcher-boy a furlong behind; road-engines that pulled giddy-go-rounds,"
11182,AL KORAN.,"rifle galleries, and swings, and sucked snortingly from wayside ponds in"
11183,AL KORAN.,"defiance of the notice-board; traction-engines, their trailers piled"
11184,AL KORAN.,"high with road metal; uniformed village nurses, one per seven statute"
11185,AL KORAN.,"miles, flitting by on their wheels; governess-carts full of pink"
11186,AL KORAN.,"children jogging unconcernedly past roaring, brazen touring-cars; the"
11187,AL KORAN.,"wayside rector with virgins in attendance, their faces screwed up"
11188,AL KORAN.,against our dust; motor-bicycles of every shape charging down at every
11189,AL KORAN.,angle; red flags of rifle-ranges; detachments of dusty-putteed
11190,AL KORAN.,"Territorials; coveys of flagrant children playing in mid-street, and the"
11191,AL KORAN.,"wise, educated English dog safe and quite silent on the pavement if his"
11192,AL KORAN.,"fool-mistress would but cease from trying to save him, passed and"
11193,AL KORAN.,repassed us in sunlit or shaded settings. But Mr. Lingnam only talked.
11194,AL KORAN.,He talked--we all sat together behind so that we could not escape
11195,AL KORAN.,him--and he talked above the worn gears and a certain maddening swish of
11196,AL KORAN.,one badly patched tire--_and_ he talked of the Federation of the Empire
11197,AL KORAN.,against all conceivable dangers except himself. Yet I was neither
11198,AL KORAN.,"brutally rude like Penfentenyou, nor swooningly bored like the"
11199,AL KORAN.,Agent-General. I remembered a certain Joseph Finsbury who delighted the
11200,AL KORAN.,Tregonwell Arms on the borders of the New Forest with nine'--it should
11201,AL KORAN.,have been ten--'versions of a single income of two hundred pounds'
11202,AL KORAN.,placing the imaginary person in--but I could not recall the list of
11203,AL KORAN.,"towns further than 'London, Paris, Bagdad, and Spitsbergen.' This last I"
11204,AL KORAN.,"must have murmured aloud, for the Agent-General suddenly became human"
11205,AL KORAN.,"and went on: 'Bussorah, Heligoland, and the Scilly Islands--'"
11206,AL KORAN.,
11207,AL KORAN.,'What?' growled Penfentenyou.
11208,AL KORAN.,
11209,AL KORAN.,"'Nothing,' said the Agent-General, squeezing my hand affectionately."
11210,AL KORAN.,'Only we have just found out that we are brothers.'
11211,AL KORAN.,
11212,AL KORAN.,"'Exactly,' said Mr. Lingnam. 'That's what I've been trying to lead up"
11213,AL KORAN.,to. We're _all_ brothers. D'you realise that fifteen years ago such a
11214,AL KORAN.,conversation as we're having would have been unthinkable? The Empire
11215,AL KORAN.,"wouldn't have been ripe for it. To go back, even ten years--'"
11216,AL KORAN.,
11217,AL KORAN.,"'I've got it,' cried the Agent-General. '""Brighton, Cincinnati, and"
11218,AL KORAN.,"Nijni-Novgorod!"" God bless R.L.S.! Go on, Uncle Joseph. I can endure"
11219,AL KORAN.,much now.'
11220,AL KORAN.,
11221,AL KORAN.,"Mr. Lingnam went on like our shandrydan, slowly and loudly. He admitted"
11222,AL KORAN.,"that a man obsessed with a Central Idea--and, after all, the only thing"
11223,AL KORAN.,"that mattered was the Idea--might become a bore, but the World's Work,"
11224,AL KORAN.,"he pointed out, had been done by bores. So he laid his bones down to"
11225,AL KORAN.,that work till we abandoned ourselves to the passage of time and the
11226,AL KORAN.,"Mercy of Allah, Who Alone closes the Mouths of His Prophets. And we"
11227,AL KORAN.,wasted more than fifty miles of summer's vivid own England upon him
11228,AL KORAN.,the while.
11229,AL KORAN.,
11230,AL KORAN.,About two o'clock we topped Sumtner Rising and looked down on the
11231,AL KORAN.,"village of Sumtner Barton, which lies just across a single railway line,"
11232,AL KORAN.,"spanned by a red brick bridge. The thick, thunderous June airs brought"
11233,AL KORAN.,us gusts of melody from a giddy-go-round steam-organ in full blast near
11234,AL KORAN.,"the pond on the village green. Drums, too, thumped and banners waved and"
11235,AL KORAN.,regalia flashed at the far end of the broad village street. Mr. Lingnam
11236,AL KORAN.,asked why.
11237,AL KORAN.,
11238,AL KORAN.,"'Nothing Imperial, I'm afraid. It looks like a Foresters' FÃªte--one of"
11239,AL KORAN.,"our big Mutual Benefit Societies,' I explained."
11240,AL KORAN.,
11241,AL KORAN.,'The Idea only needs to be co-ordinated to Imperial scale--' he began.
11242,AL KORAN.,
11243,AL KORAN.,"'But it means that the pub. will be crowded,' I went on."
11244,AL KORAN.,
11245,AL KORAN.,'What's the matter with lunching by the roadside here?' said
11246,AL KORAN.,Penfentenyou. 'We've got the lunch-basket.'
11247,AL KORAN.,
11248,AL KORAN.,"'Haven't you ever heard of Sumtner Barton ales?' I demanded, and be"
11249,AL KORAN.,"became the administrator at once, saying, '_I_ see! Lingnam can drive us"
11250,AL KORAN.,"in and we'll get some, while Holford'--this was the hireling chauffeur,"
11251,AL KORAN.,whose views on beer we knew not--'lays out lunch here. That'll be better
11252,AL KORAN.,"than eating at the pub. We can take in the Foresters' FÃªte as well, and"
11253,AL KORAN.,perhaps I can buy some newspapers at the station.'
11254,AL KORAN.,
11255,AL KORAN.,"'True,' I answered. 'The railway station is just under that bridge, and"
11256,AL KORAN.,we'll come back and lunch here.'
11257,AL KORAN.,
11258,AL KORAN.,I indicated a terrace of cool clean shade beneath kindly beeches at the
11259,AL KORAN.,"head of Sumtner Rise. As Holford got out the lunch-basket, a detachment"
11260,AL KORAN.,of Regular troops on manoeuvres swung down the baking road.
11261,AL KORAN.,
11262,AL KORAN.,"'Ah!' said Mr. Lingnam, the monthly-magazine roll in his voice. 'All"
11263,AL KORAN.,"Europe is an armed camp, groaning, as I remember I once wrote, under the"
11264,AL KORAN.,weight of its accoutrements.'
11265,AL KORAN.,
11266,AL KORAN.,"'Oh, hop in and drive,' cried Penfentenyou. 'We want that beer!'"
11267,AL KORAN.,
11268,AL KORAN.,It made no difference. Mr. Lingnam could have federated the Empire from
11269,AL KORAN.,a tight rope. He continued his oration at the wheel as we trundled.
11270,AL KORAN.,
11271,AL KORAN.,'The danger to the Younger Nations is of being drawn into this vortex of
11272,AL KORAN.,"Militarism,' he went on, dodging the rear of the soldiery."
11273,AL KORAN.,
11274,AL KORAN.,"'Slow past troops,' I hinted. 'It saves 'em dust. And we overtake on the"
11275,AL KORAN.,right as a rule in England.'
11276,AL KORAN.,
11277,AL KORAN.,'Thanks!' Mr. Lingnam slued over. 'That's another detail which needs to
11278,AL KORAN.,be co-ordinated throughout the Empire. But to go back to what I was
11279,AL KORAN.,saying. My idea has always been that the component parts of the Empire
11280,AL KORAN.,"should take counsel among themselves on the approach of war, so that,"
11281,AL KORAN.,"after we have decided on the merits of the _casus belli_, we can"
11282,AL KORAN.,"co-ordinate what part each Dominion shall play whenever war is,"
11283,AL KORAN.,"unfortunately, a possibility.'"
11284,AL KORAN.,
11285,AL KORAN.,"We neared the hog-back railway bridge, and the hireling knocked"
11286,AL KORAN.,"piteously at the grade. Mr. Lingnam changed gears, and she hoisted"
11287,AL KORAN.,herself up to a joyous _Youp-i-addy-i-ay!_ from the steam-organ. As we
11288,AL KORAN.,topped the arch we saw a Foresters' band with banners marching down
11289,AL KORAN.,the street.
11290,AL KORAN.,
11291,AL KORAN.,"'That's all very fine,' said the Agent-General, 'but in real life things"
11292,AL KORAN.,have a knack of happening without approaching--'
11293,AL KORAN.,
11294,AL KORAN.,*       *       *       *       *
11295,AL KORAN.,
11296,AL KORAN.,(Some schools of Thought hold that Time is not; and that when we attain
11297,AL KORAN.,"complete enlightenment we shall behold past, present, and future as One"
11298,AL KORAN.,Awful Whole. I myself have nearly achieved this.)
11299,AL KORAN.,
11300,AL KORAN.,*       *       *       *       *
11301,AL KORAN.,
11302,AL KORAN.,"We dipped over the bridge into the village. A boy on a bicycle, loaded"
11303,AL KORAN.,"with four paper bonnet-boxes, pedalled towards us, out of an alley on"
11304,AL KORAN.,"our right. He bowed his head the better to overcome the ascent, and"
11305,AL KORAN.,naturally took his left. Mr. Lingnam swerved frantically to the right.
11306,AL KORAN.,"Penfentenyou shouted. The boy looked up, saw the car was like to squeeze"
11307,AL KORAN.,"him against the bridge wall, flung himself off his machine and across"
11308,AL KORAN.,the narrow pavement into the nearest house. He slammed the door at the
11309,AL KORAN.,"precise moment when the car, all brakes set, bunted the abandoned"
11310,AL KORAN.,"bicycle, shattering three of the bonnet-boxes and jerking the fourth"
11311,AL KORAN.,over the unscreened dashboard into Mr. Lingnam's arms.
11312,AL KORAN.,
11313,AL KORAN.,"There was a dead stillness, then a hiss like that of escaping steam, and"
11314,AL KORAN.,a man who had been running towards us ran the other way.
11315,AL KORAN.,
11316,AL KORAN.,"'Why! I think that those must be bees,' said Mr. Lingnam."
11317,AL KORAN.,
11318,AL KORAN.,They were--four full swarms--and the first living objects which he had
11319,AL KORAN.,remarked upon all day.
11320,AL KORAN.,
11321,AL KORAN.,"Some one said, 'Oh, God!' The Agent-General went out over the back of"
11322,AL KORAN.,"the car, crying resolutely: 'Stop the traffic! Stop the traffic, there!'"
11323,AL KORAN.,"Penfentenyou was already on the pavement ringing a door-bell, so I had"
11324,AL KORAN.,"both their rugs, which--for I am an apiarist--I threw over my head."
11325,AL KORAN.,While I was tucking my trousers into my socks--for I am an apiarist of
11326,AL KORAN.,experience--Mr. Lingnam picked up the unexploded bonnet-box and with a
11327,AL KORAN.,single magnificent gesture (he told us afterwards he thought there was a
11328,AL KORAN.,"river beneath) hurled it over the parapet of the bridge, ere he ran"
11329,AL KORAN.,"across the road towards the village green. Now, the station platform"
11330,AL KORAN.,immediately below was crowded with Foresters and their friends waiting
11331,AL KORAN.,to welcome a delegation from a sister Court. I saw the box burst on the
11332,AL KORAN.,flint edging of the station garden and the contents sweep forward
11333,AL KORAN.,cone-wise like shrapnel. But the result was stimulating rather than
11334,AL KORAN.,sedative. All those well-dressed people below shouted like Sodom and
11335,AL KORAN.,"Gomorrah. Then they moved as a unit into the booking-office, the"
11336,AL KORAN.,"waiting-rooms, and other places, shut doors and windows and declaimed"
11337,AL KORAN.,"aloud, while the incoming train whistled far down the line."
11338,AL KORAN.,
11339,AL KORAN.,"I pivoted round cross-legged on the back seat, like a Circassian beauty"
11340,AL KORAN.,"beneath her veil, and saw Penfentenyou, his coat-collar over his ears,"
11341,AL KORAN.,dancing before a shut door and holding up handfuls of currency to a
11342,AL KORAN.,"silver-haired woman at an upper window, who only mouthed and shook her"
11343,AL KORAN.,"head. A little child, carrying a kitten, came smiling round a corner."
11344,AL KORAN.,Suddenly (but these things moved me no more than so many yards of
11345,AL KORAN.,three-penny cinematograph-film) the kitten leaped spitting from her
11346,AL KORAN.,"arms, the child burst into tears, Penfentenyou, still dancing, snatched"
11347,AL KORAN.,"her up and tucked her under his coat, the woman's countenance blanched,"
11348,AL KORAN.,"the front door opened, Penfentenyou and the child pressed through, and I"
11349,AL KORAN.,was alone in an inhospitable world where every one was shutting windows
11350,AL KORAN.,and calling children home.
11351,AL KORAN.,
11352,AL KORAN.,A voice cried: 'You've frowtened 'em! You've frowtened 'em! Throw dust
11353,AL KORAN.,on 'em and they'll settle!'
11354,AL KORAN.,
11355,AL KORAN.,I did not desire to throw dust on any created thing. I needed both hands
11356,AL KORAN.,"for my draperies and two more for my stockings. Besides, the bees were"
11357,AL KORAN.,doing me no hurt. They recognised me as a member of the County
11358,AL KORAN.,Bee-keepers' Association who had paid his annual subscription and was
11359,AL KORAN.,entitled to a free seat at all apicultural exhibitions. The quiver and
11360,AL KORAN.,"the churn of the hireling car, or it might have been the lurching"
11361,AL KORAN.,"banners and the arrogant big drum, inclined many of them to go up"
11362,AL KORAN.,"street, and pay court to the advancing Foresters' band. So they went,"
11363,AL KORAN.,"such as had not followed Mr. Lingnam in his flight toward the green, and"
11364,AL KORAN.,I looked out of two goggled eyes instead of half a one at the
11365,AL KORAN.,"approaching musicians, while I listened with both ears to the delayed"
11366,AL KORAN.,train's second whistle down the line beneath me.
11367,AL KORAN.,
11368,AL KORAN.,The Forester's band no more knew what was coming than do troops under
11369,AL KORAN.,"sudden fire. Indeed, there were the same extravagant gestures and"
11370,AL KORAN.,contortions as attend wounds and deaths in war; the very same uncanny
11371,AL KORAN.,"cessations of speech--for the trombone was cut off at midslide, even as"
11372,AL KORAN.,"a man drops with a syllable on his tongue. They clawed, they slapped,"
11373,AL KORAN.,"they fled, leaving behind them a trophy of banners and brasses crudely"
11374,AL KORAN.,arranged round the big drum. Then that end of the street also shut its
11375,AL KORAN.,"windows, and the village, stripped of life, lay round me like a reef at"
11376,AL KORAN.,"low tide. Though I am, as I have said, an apiarist in good standing, I"
11377,AL KORAN.,never realised that there were so many bees in the world. When they had
11378,AL KORAN.,"woven a flashing haze from one end of the desert street to the other,"
11379,AL KORAN.,there remained reserves enough to form knops and pendules on all
11380,AL KORAN.,"window-sills and gutter-ends, without diminishing the multitudes in the"
11381,AL KORAN.,"three oozing bonnet-boxes, or drawing on the Fourth (Railway) Battalion"
11382,AL KORAN.,in charge of the station below. The prisoners in the waiting-rooms and
11383,AL KORAN.,other places there cried out a great deal (I argued that they were dying
11384,AL KORAN.,"of the heat), and at regular intervals the stationmaster called and"
11385,AL KORAN.,"called to a signalman who was not on duty, and the train whistled as it"
11386,AL KORAN.,drew nearer.
11387,AL KORAN.,
11388,AL KORAN.,"Then Penfentenyou, venal and adaptable politician of the type that"
11389,AL KORAN.,"survives at the price of all the higher emotions, appeared at the window"
11390,AL KORAN.,"of the house on my right, broken and congested with mirth, the woman"
11391,AL KORAN.,"beside him, and the child in his arms. I saw his mouth open and shut, he"
11392,AL KORAN.,"hollowed his hands round it, but the churr of the motor and the bees"
11393,AL KORAN.,drowned his words. He pointed dramatically across the street many times
11394,AL KORAN.,"and fell back, tears running down his face. I turned like a hooded"
11395,AL KORAN.,barbette in a heavy seaway (not knowing when my trousers would come out
11396,AL KORAN.,"of my socks again) through one hundred and eighty degrees, and in due"
11397,AL KORAN.,"time bore on the village green. There was a salmon in the pond, rising"
11398,AL KORAN.,short at a cloud of midges to the tune of _Yip-i-addy_; but there was
11399,AL KORAN.,"none to gaff him. The swing-boats were empty, cocoa-nuts sat still on"
11400,AL KORAN.,"their red sticks before white screens, and the gay-painted horses of the"
11401,AL KORAN.,"giddy-go-rounds revolved riderless. All was melody, green turf, bright"
11402,AL KORAN.,"water, and this greedy gambolling fish. When I had identified it by its"
11403,AL KORAN.,"grey gills and binoculars as Lingnam, I prostrated myself before Allah"
11404,AL KORAN.,in that mirth which is more truly labour than any prayer. Then I turned
11405,AL KORAN.,"to the purple Penfentenyou at the window, and wiped my eyes on the"
11406,AL KORAN.,rug edge.
11407,AL KORAN.,
11408,AL KORAN.,He raised the window half one cautious inch and bellowed through the
11409,AL KORAN.,crack: 'Did you see _him_? Have they got _you_? I can see lots of
11410,AL KORAN.,things from here. It's like a three-ring circus!'
11411,AL KORAN.,
11412,AL KORAN.,"'Can you see the station?' I replied, nodding toward the right rear"
11413,AL KORAN.,mudguard.
11414,AL KORAN.,
11415,AL KORAN.,"He twisted and craned sideways, but could not command that beautiful"
11416,AL KORAN.,view.
11417,AL KORAN.,
11418,AL KORAN.,'No! What's it like?' he cried.
11419,AL KORAN.,
11420,AL KORAN.,"'Hell!' I shouted. The silver-haired woman frowned; so did Penfentenyou,"
11421,AL KORAN.,"and, I think, apologised to her for my language."
11422,AL KORAN.,
11423,AL KORAN.,"'You're always so extreme,' he fluted reproachfully. 'You forget that"
11424,AL KORAN.,"nothing matters except the Idea. Besides, they are this lady's bees.'"
11425,AL KORAN.,
11426,AL KORAN.,"He closed the window, and introduced us through it in dumb show; but he"
11427,AL KORAN.,contrived to give the impression that _I_ was the specimen under glass.
11428,AL KORAN.,
11429,AL KORAN.,A spurt of damp steam saved me from apoplexy. The train had lost
11430,AL KORAN.,"patience at last, and was coming into the station directly beneath me to"
11431,AL KORAN.,see what was the matter. Happy voices sang and heads were thrust out all
11432,AL KORAN.,"along the compartments, but none answered their songs or greetings. She"
11433,AL KORAN.,"halted, and the people began to get out. Then they began to get in"
11434,AL KORAN.,"again, as their friends in the waiting-rooms advised. All did not catch"
11435,AL KORAN.,"the warning, so there was congestion at the doors, but those whom the"
11436,AL KORAN.,bees caught got in first.
11437,AL KORAN.,
11438,AL KORAN.,"Still the bees, more bent on their own business than wanton torture,"
11439,AL KORAN.,"kept to the south end of the platform by the bookstall, and that was why"
11440,AL KORAN.,the completely exposed engine-driver at the north end of the train did
11441,AL KORAN.,not at first understand the hermetically sealed stationmaster when the
11442,AL KORAN.,latter shouted to him many times to 'get on out o' this.'
11443,AL KORAN.,
11444,AL KORAN.,'Where are you?' was the reply. 'And what for?'
11445,AL KORAN.,
11446,AL KORAN.,"'It don't matter where I am, an' you'll get what-for in a minute if you"
11447,AL KORAN.,"don't shift,' said the stationmaster. 'Drop 'em at Parson's Meadow and"
11448,AL KORAN.,they can walk up over the fields.'
11449,AL KORAN.,
11450,AL KORAN.,"That bare-armed, thin-shirted idiot, leaning out of the cab, took the"
11451,AL KORAN.,"stationmaster's orders as an insult to his dignity, and roared at the"
11452,AL KORAN.,"shut offices: 'You'll give me what-for, will you? Look 'ere, I'm not in"
11453,AL KORAN.,the 'abit of--' His outstretched hand flew to his neck.... Do you know
11454,AL KORAN.,that if you sting an engine-driver it is the same as stinging his train?
11455,AL KORAN.,"She starts with a jerk that nearly smashes the couplings, and runs,"
11456,AL KORAN.,"barking like a dog, till she is out of sight. Nor does she think about"
11457,AL KORAN.,spilled people and parted families on the platform behind her. I had to
11458,AL KORAN.,"do all that. There was a man called Fred, and his wife Harriet--a"
11459,AL KORAN.,"cheery, full-blooded couple--who interested me immensely before they"
11460,AL KORAN.,"battered their way into a small detached building, already densely"
11461,AL KORAN.,occupied. There was also a nameless bachelor who sat under a half-opened
11462,AL KORAN.,"umbrella and twirled it dizzily, which was so new a game that I"
11463,AL KORAN.,applauded aloud.
11464,AL KORAN.,
11465,AL KORAN.,"When they had thoroughly cleared the ground, the bees set about making"
11466,AL KORAN.,comb for publication at the bookstall counter. Presently some bold
11467,AL KORAN.,hearts tiptoed out of the waiting-rooms over the loud gravel with the
11468,AL KORAN.,"consciously modest air of men leaving church, climbed the wooden"
11469,AL KORAN.,"staircase to the bridge, and so reached my level, where the"
11470,AL KORAN.,inexhaustible bonnet-boxes were still vomiting squadrons and platoons.
11471,AL KORAN.,There was little need to bid them descend. They had wrapped their heads
11472,AL KORAN.,"in handkerchiefs, so that they looked like the disappointed dead"
11473,AL KORAN.,"scuttling back to Purgatory. Only one old gentleman, pontifically draped"
11474,AL KORAN.,"in a banner embroidered 'Temperance and Fortitude,' ran the gauntlet"
11475,AL KORAN.,"up-street, shouting as he passed me, 'It's night or BlÃ¼cher, Mister.'"
11476,AL KORAN.,"They let him in at the White Hart, the pub. where I should have"
11477,AL KORAN.,bought the beer.
11478,AL KORAN.,
11479,AL KORAN.,After this the day sagged. I fell to reckoning how long a man in a
11480,AL KORAN.,"Turkish bath, weakened by excessive laughter, could live without food,"
11481,AL KORAN.,and specially drink; and how long a disenfranchised bee could hold out
11482,AL KORAN.,under the same conditions.
11483,AL KORAN.,
11484,AL KORAN.,"Obviously, since her one practical joke costs her her life, the bee can"
11485,AL KORAN.,have but small sense of humour; but her fundamentally dismal and
11486,AL KORAN.,ungracious outlook on life impressed me beyond words. She had paralysed
11487,AL KORAN.,"locomotion, wiped out trade, social intercourse, mutual trust, love,"
11488,AL KORAN.,"friendship, sport, music (the lonely steam-organ had run down at last),"
11489,AL KORAN.,"all that gives substance, colour or savour to life, and yet, in the"
11490,AL KORAN.,"barren desert she had created, was not one whit more near to the"
11491,AL KORAN.,evolution of a saner order of things. The Heavens were darkened with the
11492,AL KORAN.,swarms' divided counsels; the street shimmered with their purposeless
11493,AL KORAN.,"sallies. They clotted on tiles and gutter-pipes, and began frenziedly to"
11494,AL KORAN.,build a cell or two of comb ere they discovered that their queen was
11495,AL KORAN.,"not with them; then flung off to seek her, or whirled, dishevelled and"
11496,AL KORAN.,"insane, into another hissing nebula on the false rumour that she was"
11497,AL KORAN.,"there. I scowled upon them with disfavour, and a massy, blue"
11498,AL KORAN.,thunder-head rose majestically from behind the elm-trees of Sumtner
11499,AL KORAN.,"Barton Rectory, arched over and scowled with me. Then I realised that it"
11500,AL KORAN.,"was not bees nor locusts that had darkened the skies, but the on-coming"
11501,AL KORAN.,of the malignant English thunderstorm--the one thing before which even
11502,AL KORAN.,Deborah the bee cannot express her silly little self.
11503,AL KORAN.,
11504,AL KORAN.,"'Aha! _Now_ you'll catch it,' I said, as the herald gusts set the big"
11505,AL KORAN.,drum rolling down the street like a box-kite. Up and up yearned the dark
11506,AL KORAN.,"cloud, till the first lightning quivered and cut. Deborah cowered. Where"
11507,AL KORAN.,"she flew, there she fled; where she was, there she sat still; and the"
11508,AL KORAN.,solid rain closed in on her as a book that is closed when the chapter is
11509,AL KORAN.,"finished. By the time it had soaked to my second rug, Penfentenyou"
11510,AL KORAN.,"appeared at the window, wiping his false mouth on a napkin."
11511,AL KORAN.,
11512,AL KORAN.,'Are you all right?' he inquired. 'Then _that's_ all right! Mrs. Bellamy
11513,AL KORAN.,says that her bees don't sting in the wet. You'd better fetch Lingnam
11514,AL KORAN.,over. He's got to pay for them and the bicycle.'
11515,AL KORAN.,
11516,AL KORAN.,"I had no words which the silver-haired lady could listen to, but paddled"
11517,AL KORAN.,across the flooded street between flashes to the pond on the green. Mr.
11518,AL KORAN.,"Lingnam, scarcely visible through the sheeting downpour, trotted round"
11519,AL KORAN.,"the edge. He bore himself nobly, and lied at the mere sight of me."
11520,AL KORAN.,
11521,AL KORAN.,'Isn't this wet?' he cried. 'It has drenched me to the skin. I shall
11522,AL KORAN.,need a change.'
11523,AL KORAN.,
11524,AL KORAN.,"'Come along,' I said. 'I don't know what you'll get, but you deserve"
11525,AL KORAN.,more.'
11526,AL KORAN.,
11527,AL KORAN.,"Penfentenyou, dry, fed, and in command, let us in. 'You,' he whispered"
11528,AL KORAN.,"to me, 'are to wait in the scullery. Mrs. Bellamy didn't like the way"
11529,AL KORAN.,you talked about her bees. Hsh! Hsh! She's a kind-hearted lady. She's a
11530,AL KORAN.,"widow, Lingnam, but she's kept _his_ clothes, and as soon as you've paid"
11531,AL KORAN.,for the damage she'll rent you a suit. I've arranged it all!'
11532,AL KORAN.,
11533,AL KORAN.,"'Then tell him he mustn't undress in my hall,' said a voice from the"
11534,AL KORAN.,stair-head.
11535,AL KORAN.,
11536,AL KORAN.,'Tell _her_--' Lingnam began.
11537,AL KORAN.,
11538,AL KORAN.,"'Come and look at the pretty suit I've chosen,' Penfentenyou cooed, as"
11539,AL KORAN.,one cajoling a maniac.
11540,AL KORAN.,
11541,AL KORAN.,"I staggered out-of-doors again, and fell into the car, whose"
11542,AL KORAN.,ever-running machinery masked my yelps and hiccups. When I raised my
11543,AL KORAN.,"forehead from the wheel, I saw that traffic through the village had been"
11544,AL KORAN.,"resumed, after, as my watch showed, one and one-half hour's suspension."
11545,AL KORAN.,"There were two limousines, one landau, one doctor's car, three"
11546,AL KORAN.,"touring-cars, one patent steam-laundry van, three tricars, one"
11547,AL KORAN.,"traction-engine, some motor-cycles, one with a side-car, and one brewery"
11548,AL KORAN.,"lorry. It was the allegory of my own imperturbable country, delayed for"
11549,AL KORAN.,a short time by unforeseen external events but now going about her
11550,AL KORAN.,"business, and I blessed Her with tears in my eyes, even though I knew"
11551,AL KORAN.,She looked upon me as drunk and incapable.
11552,AL KORAN.,
11553,AL KORAN.,Then troops came over the bridge behind me--a company of dripping wet
11554,AL KORAN.,"Regulars without any expression. In their rear, carrying the"
11555,AL KORAN.,"lunch-basket, marched the Agent-General and Holford the hired chauffeur."
11556,AL KORAN.,
11557,AL KORAN.,"'I say,' said the Agent-General, nodding at the darkened khaki backs."
11558,AL KORAN.,'If _that's_ what we've got to depend on in event of war they're a
11559,AL KORAN.,"broken reed. They ran like hares--ran like hares, I tell you.'"
11560,AL KORAN.,
11561,AL KORAN.,'And you?' I asked.
11562,AL KORAN.,
11563,AL KORAN.,"'Oh, I just sauntered back over the bridge and stopped the traffic that"
11564,AL KORAN.,"end. Then I had lunch. 'Pity about the beer, though. I say--these"
11565,AL KORAN.,cushions are sopping wet!'
11566,AL KORAN.,
11567,AL KORAN.,"'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I haven't had time to turn 'em.'"
11568,AL KORAN.,
11569,AL KORAN.,'Nor there wasn't any need to 'ave kept the engine runnin' all this
11570,AL KORAN.,"time,' said Holford sternly. 'I'll 'ave to account for the expenditure"
11571,AL KORAN.,"of petrol. It exceeds the mileage indicated, you see.'"
11572,AL KORAN.,
11573,AL KORAN.,"'I'm sorry,' I repeated. After all, that is the way that taxpayers"
11574,AL KORAN.,regard most crises.
11575,AL KORAN.,
11576,AL KORAN.,The house-door opened and Penfentenyou and another came out into the now
11577,AL KORAN.,thinning rain.
11578,AL KORAN.,
11579,AL KORAN.,"'Ah! There you both are! Here's Lingnam,' he cried. 'He's got a little"
11580,AL KORAN.,wet. He's had to change.'
11581,AL KORAN.,
11582,AL KORAN.,"'We saw that. I was too sore and weak to begin another laugh, but the"
11583,AL KORAN.,Agent-General crumpled up where he stood. The late Mr. Bellamy must have
11584,AL KORAN.,"been a man of tremendous personality, which he had impressed on every"
11585,AL KORAN.,angle of his garments. I was told later that he had died in delirium
11586,AL KORAN.,"tremens, which at once explained the pattern, and the reason why Mr."
11587,AL KORAN.,"Lingnam, writhing inside it, swore so inspiredly. Of the deliberate and"
11588,AL KORAN.,"diffuse Federationist there remained no trace, save the binoculars and"
11589,AL KORAN.,"two damp whiskers. We stood on the pavement, before Elemental Man"
11590,AL KORAN.,calling on Elemental Powers to condemn and incinerate Creation.
11591,AL KORAN.,
11592,AL KORAN.,"'Well, hadn't we better be getting back?' said the Agent-General."
11593,AL KORAN.,
11594,AL KORAN.,'Look out!' I remarked casually. 'Those bonnet-boxes are full of bees
11595,AL KORAN.,still!'
11596,AL KORAN.,
11597,AL KORAN.,"'Are they?' said the livid Mr. Lingnam, and tilted them over with the"
11598,AL KORAN.,late Mr. Bellamy's large boots. Deborah rolled out in drenched lumps
11599,AL KORAN.,into the swilling gutter. There was a muffled shriek at the window where
11600,AL KORAN.,Mrs. Bellamy gesticulated.
11601,AL KORAN.,
11602,AL KORAN.,"'It's all right. I've paid for them,' said Mr. Lingnam. He dumped out"
11603,AL KORAN.,the last dregs like mould from a pot-bound flower-pot.
11604,AL KORAN.,
11605,AL KORAN.,'What? Are you going to take 'em home with you?' said the Agent-General.
11606,AL KORAN.,
11607,AL KORAN.,'No!' He passed a wet hand over his streaky forehead. 'Wasn't there a
11608,AL KORAN.,bicycle that was the beginning of this trouble?' said he.
11609,AL KORAN.,
11610,AL KORAN.,"'It's under the fore-axle, sir,' said Holford promptly. 'I can fish it"
11611,AL KORAN.,out from 'ere.'
11612,AL KORAN.,
11613,AL KORAN.,"'Not till I've done with it, please.' Before we could stop him, he had"
11614,AL KORAN.,jumped into the car and taken charge. The hireling leaped into her
11615,AL KORAN.,"collar, surged, shrieked (less loudly than Mrs. Bellamy at the window),"
11616,AL KORAN.,"and swept on. That which came out behind her was, as Holford truly"
11617,AL KORAN.,"observed, no joy-wheel. Mr. Lingnam swung round the big drum in the"
11618,AL KORAN.,"market-place and thundered back, shouting: 'Leave it alone. It's"
11619,AL KORAN.,my meat!'
11620,AL KORAN.,
11621,AL KORAN.,"'Mince-meat, 'e means,' said Holford after this second trituration. 'You"
11622,AL KORAN.,"couldn't say now it 'ad ever _been_ one, could you?'"
11623,AL KORAN.,
11624,AL KORAN.,Mrs. Bellamy opened the window and spoke. It appears she had only
11625,AL KORAN.,"charged for damage to the bicycle, not for the entire machine which Mr."
11626,AL KORAN.,"Lingnam was ruthlessly gleaning, spoke by spoke, from the highway and"
11627,AL KORAN.,"cramming into the slack of the hood. At last he answered, and I have"
11628,AL KORAN.,"never seen a man foam at the mouth before. 'If you don't stop, I shall"
11629,AL KORAN.,come into your house--in this car--and drive upstairs and--kill you!'
11630,AL KORAN.,
11631,AL KORAN.,"She stopped; he stopped. Holford took the wheel, and we got away. It was"
11632,AL KORAN.,"time, for the sun shone after the storm, and Deborah beneath the tiles"
11633,AL KORAN.,and the eaves already felt its reviving influence compel her to her
11634,AL KORAN.,interrupted labours of federation. We warned the village policeman at
11635,AL KORAN.,the far end of the street that he might have to suspend traffic again.
11636,AL KORAN.,"The proprietor of the giddy-go-round, swings, and cocoanut-shies wanted"
11637,AL KORAN.,"to know from whom, in this world or another, he could recover damages."
11638,AL KORAN.,Mr. Lingnam referred him most directly to Mrs. Bellamy.... Then we
11639,AL KORAN.,went home.
11640,AL KORAN.,
11641,AL KORAN.,After dinner that evening Mr. Lingnam rose stiffly in his place to make
11642,AL KORAN.,a few remarks on the Federation of the Empire on the lines of
11643,AL KORAN.,"Co-ordinated, Offensive Operations, backed by the Entire Effective"
11644,AL KORAN.,"Forces, Moral, Military, and Fiscal, of Permanently Mobilised"
11645,AL KORAN.,"Communities, the whole brought to bear, without any respect to the"
11646,AL KORAN.,"merits of any _casus belli_, instantaneously, automatically, and"
11647,AL KORAN.,remorselessly at the first faint buzz of war.
11648,AL KORAN.,
11649,AL KORAN.,"'The trouble with Us,' said he, 'is that We take such an infernally long"
11650,AL KORAN.,time making sure that We are right that We don't go ahead when things
11651,AL KORAN.,"happen. For instance, I ought to have gone ahead instead of pulling up"
11652,AL KORAN.,when I hit that bicycle.'
11653,AL KORAN.,
11654,AL KORAN.,"'But you were in the wrong, Lingnam, when you turned to the right,' I"
11655,AL KORAN.,put in.
11656,AL KORAN.,
11657,AL KORAN.,"'I don't want to hear any more of your damned, detached, mugwumping"
11658,AL KORAN.,"excuses for the other fellow,' he snapped."
11659,AL KORAN.,
11660,AL KORAN.,"'Now you're beginning to see things,' said Penfentenyou. 'I hope you"
11661,AL KORAN.,won't backslide when the swellings go down.'

11667,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,I was Lord of Cities very sumptuously builded.
11668,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Seven roaring Cities paid me tribute from afar.
11669,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Ivory their outposts were--the guardrooms of them
11670,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"gilded,"
11671,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,And garrisoned with Amazons invincible in war.
11672,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11673,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,All the world went softly when it walked before my
11674,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Cities--
11675,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Neither King nor Army vexed my peoples at their toil.
11676,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Never horse nor chariot irked or overbore my Cities,"
11677,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Never Mob nor Ruler questioned whence they drew
11678,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,their spoil.
11679,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11680,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Banded, mailed and arrogant from sunrise unto sunset,"
11681,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Singing while they sacked it, they possessed the land"

11683,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Yet when men would rob them, they resisted, they"
11684,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,made onset
11685,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,And pierced the smoke of battle with a thousand-sabred

11687,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11688,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"So they warred and trafficked only yesterday, my Cities."
11689,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,To-day there is no mark or mound of where my Cities
11690,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,stood.
11691,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,For the River rose at midnight and it washed away my
11692,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Cities.
11693,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,They are evened with Atlantis and the towns before the
11694,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Flood.
11695,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11696,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Rain on rain-gorged channels raised the water-levels
11697,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"round them,"
11698,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Freshet backed on freshet swelled and swept their
11699,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"world from sight,"
11700,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Till the emboldened floods linked arms and flashing forward
11701,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,drowned them--
11702,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Drowned my Seven Cities and their peoples in one
11703,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,night!
11704,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11705,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Low among the alders lie their derelict foundations,"
11706,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,The beams wherein they trusted and the plinths whereon
11707,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,they built--
11708,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"My rulers and their treasure and their unborn populations,"
11709,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Dead, destroyed, aborted, and defiled with mud and"

11711,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11712,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,The Daughters of the Palace whom they cherished in
11713,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"my Cities,"
11714,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"My silver-tongued Princesses, and the promise of their"
11715,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,May--
11716,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Their bridegrooms of the June-tide--all have perished
11717,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"in my Cities,"
11718,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,With the harsh envenomed virgins that can neither

11720,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11721,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"I was Lord of Cities--I will build anew my Cities,"
11722,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Seven, set on rocks, above the wrath of any flood."
11723,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Nor will I rest from search till I have filled anew my Cities

11733,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Swept and Garnished'
11734,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11735,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,(January 1915)
11736,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11737,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,When the first waves of feverish cold stole over Frau Ebermann she very
11738,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,wisely telephoned for the doctor and went to bed. He diagnosed the
11739,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"attack as mild influenza, prescribed the appropriate remedies, and left"
11740,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her to the care of her one servant in her comfortable Berlin flat. Frau
11741,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Ebermann, beneath the thick coverlet, curled up with what patience she"
11742,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"could until the aspirin should begin to act, and Anna should come back"
11743,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"from the chemist with the formamint, the ammoniated quinine, the"
11744,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"eucalyptus, and the little tin steam-inhaler. Meantime, every bone in"
11745,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"her body ached; her head throbbed; her hot, dry hands would not stay the"
11746,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"same size for a minute together; and her body, tucked into the smallest"
11747,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"possible compass, shrank from the chill of the well-warmed sheets."
11748,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11749,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Of a sudden she noticed that an imitation-lace cover which should have
11750,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,lain mathematically square with the imitation-marble top of the radiator
11751,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,behind the green plush sofa had slipped away so that one corner hung
11752,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,over the bronze-painted steam pipes. She recalled that she must have
11753,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,rested her poor head against the radiator-top while she was taking off
11754,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"her boots. She tried to get up and set the thing straight, but the"
11755,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"radiator at once receded toward the horizon, which, unlike true"
11756,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"horizons, slanted diagonally, exactly parallel with the dropped lace"
11757,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,edge of the cover. Frau Ebermann groaned through sticky lips and
11758,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,lay still.
11759,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11760,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Certainly, I have a temperature,' she said. 'Certainly, I have a grave"
11761,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,temperature. I should have been warned by that chill after dinner.'
11762,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11763,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"She resolved to shut her hot-lidded eyes, but opened them in a little"
11764,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,while to torture herself with the knowledge of that ungeometrical thing
11765,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"against the far wall. Then she saw a child--an untidy, thin-faced little"
11766,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"girl of about ten, who must have strayed in from the adjoining flat."
11767,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,This proved--Frau Ebermann groaned again at the way the world falls to
11768,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,bits when one is sick--proved that Anna had forgotten to shut the outer
11769,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,door of the flat when she went to the chemist. Frau Ebermann had had
11770,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"children of her own, but they were all grown up now, and she had never"
11771,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,been a child-lover in any sense. Yet the intruder might be made to serve
11772,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her scheme of things.
11773,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11774,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Make--put,' she muttered thickly, 'that white thing straight on the top"
11775,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,of that yellow thing.'
11776,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11777,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"The child paid no attention, but moved about the room, investigating"
11778,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,everything that came in her way--the yellow cut-glass handles of the
11779,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"chest of drawers, the stamped bronze hook to hold back the heavy puce"
11780,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"curtains, and the mauve enamel, New Art finger-plates on the door. Frau"
11781,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Ebermann watched indignantly.
11782,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11783,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Aie! That is bad and rude. Go away!' she cried, though it hurt her to"
11784,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,raise her voice. 'Go away by the road you came!' The child passed
11785,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"behind the bed-foot, where she could not see her. 'Shut the door as you"
11786,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"go. I will speak to Anna, but--first, put that white thing straight.'"
11787,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11788,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"She closed her eyes in misery of body and soul. The outer door clicked,"
11789,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"and Anna entered, very penitent that she had stayed so long at the"
11790,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,chemist's. But it had been difficult to find the proper type of
11791,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"inhaler, and--"
11792,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11793,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Where did the child go?' moaned Frau Ebermann--'the child that was
11794,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,here?'
11795,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11796,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'There was no child,' said startled Anna. 'How should any child come in"
11797,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,when I shut the door behind me after I go out? All the keys of the flats
11798,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,are different.'
11799,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11800,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'No, no! You forgot this time. But my back is aching, and up my legs"
11801,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"also. Besides, who knows what it may have fingered and upset? Look"
11802,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and see.'
11803,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11804,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Nothing is fingered, nothing is upset,' Anna replied, as she took the"
11805,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,inhaler from its paper box.
11806,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11807,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes, there is. Now I remember all about it. Put--put that white thing,"
11808,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"with the open edge--the lace, I mean--quite straight on that--' she"
11809,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"pointed. Anna, accustomed to her ways, understood and went to it."
11810,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11811,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Now, is it quite straight?' Frau Ebermann demanded."
11812,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11813,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Perfectly,' said Anna. 'In fact, in the very centre of the radiator.'"
11814,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Anna measured the equal margins with her knuckle, as she had been told"
11815,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,to do when she first took service.
11816,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11817,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'And my tortoise-shell hair brushes?' Frau Ebermann could not command
11818,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her dressing-table from where she lay.
11819,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11820,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Perfectly straight, side by side in the big tray, and the comb laid"
11821,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,across them. Your watch also in the coralline watch-holder.
11822,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Everything'--she moved round the room to make sure--'everything is as
11823,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you have it when you are well.' Frau Ebermann sighed with relief. It
11824,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,seemed to her that the room and her head had suddenly grown cooler.
11825,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11826,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Good!' said she. 'Now warm my night-gown in the kitchen, so it will be"
11827,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,ready when I have perspired. And the towels also. Make the inhaler
11828,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"steam, and put in the eucalyptus; that is good for the larynx. Then sit"
11829,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"you in the kitchen, and come when I ring. But, first, my"
11830,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,hot-water bottle.'
11831,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11832,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,It was brought and scientifically tucked in.
11833,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11834,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'What news?' said Frau Ebermann drowsily. She had not been out that day.
11835,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11836,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Another victory,' said Anna. 'Many more prisoners and guns.'"
11837,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11838,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Frau Ebermann purred, one might almost say grunted, contentedly."
11839,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11840,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'That is good too,' she said; and Anna, after lighting the inhaler-lamp,"
11841,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,went out.
11842,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11843,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Frau Ebermann reflected that in an hour or so the aspirin would begin to
11844,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"work, and all would be well. To-morrow--no, the day after--she would"
11845,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,take up life with something to talk over with her friends at coffee. It
11846,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,was rare--every one knew it--that she should be overcome by any
11847,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,ailment. Yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest
11848,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,deviation from daily routine and ritual. She would tell her friends--she
11849,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,ran over their names one by one--exactly what measures she had taken
11850,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,against the lace cover on the radiator-top and in regard to her two
11851,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,tortoise-shell hair brushes and the comb at right angles. How she had
11852,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,set everything in order--everything in order. She roved further afield
11853,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,as she wriggled her toes luxuriously on the hot-water bottle. If it
11854,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"pleased our dear God to take her to Himself, and she was not so young as"
11855,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,she had been--there was that plate of the four lower ones in the blue
11856,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"tooth-glass, for instance--He should find all her belongings fit to meet"
11857,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,His eye. 'Swept and garnished' were the words that shaped themselves in
11858,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her intent brain. 'Swept and garnished for--'
11859,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11860,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"No, it was certainly not for the dear Lord that she had swept; she would"
11861,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"have her room swept out to-morrow or the day after, and garnished. Her"
11862,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,hands began to swell again into huge pillows of nothingness. Then they
11863,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"shrank, and so did her head, to minute dots. It occurred to her that she"
11864,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"was waiting for some event, some tremendously important event, to come"
11865,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,to pass. She lay with shut eyes for a long time till her head and hands
11866,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,should return to their proper size.
11867,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11868,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,She opened her eyes with a jerk.
11869,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11870,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'How stupid of me,' she said aloud, 'to set the room in order for a"
11871,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,parcel of dirty little children!'
11872,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11873,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"They were there--five of them, two little boys and three girls--headed"
11874,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,by the anxious-eyed ten-year-old whom she had seen before. They must
11875,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"have entered by the outer door, which Anna had neglected to shut behind"
11876,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her when she returned with the inhaler. She counted them backward and
11877,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"forward as one counts scales--one, two, three, four, five."
11878,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11879,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"They took no notice of her, but hung about, first on one foot then on"
11880,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the other, like strayed chickens, the smaller ones holding by the"
11881,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,larger. They had the air of utterly wearied passengers in a railway
11882,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"waiting-room, and their clothes were disgracefully dirty."
11883,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11884,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Go away!' cried Frau Ebermann at last, after she had struggled, it"
11885,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"seemed to her, for years to shape the words."
11886,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11887,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'You called?' said Anna at the living-room door.
11888,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11889,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'No,' said her mistress. 'Did you shut the flat door when you came in?'"
11890,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11891,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Assuredly,' said Anna. 'Besides, it is made to catch shut of itself.'"
11892,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11893,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Then go away,' said she, very little above a whisper. If Anna pretended"
11894,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"not to see the children, she would speak to Anna later on."
11895,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11896,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'And now,' she said, turning toward them as soon as the door closed. The"
11897,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"smallest of the crowd smiled at her, and shook his head before he buried"
11898,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,it in his sister's skirts.
11899,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11900,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Why--don't--you--go--away?' she whispered earnestly.
11901,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11902,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Again they took no notice, but, guided by the elder girl, set themselves"
11903,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"to climb, boots and all, on to the green plush sofa in front of the"
11904,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"radiator. The little boys had to be pushed, as they could not compass"
11905,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the stretch unaided. They settled themselves in a row, with small gasps"
11906,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"of relief, and pawed the plush approvingly."
11907,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11908,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'I ask you--I ask you why do you not go away--why do you not go away?'
11909,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Frau Ebermann found herself repeating the question twenty times. It
11910,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,seemed to her that everything in the world hung on the answer. 'You know
11911,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you should not come into houses and rooms unless you are invited. Not
11912,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"houses and bedrooms, you know.'"
11913,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11914,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'No,' a solemn little six-year-old repeated, 'not houses nor bedrooms,"
11915,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"nor dining-rooms, nor churches, nor all those places. Shouldn't come in."
11916,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,It's rude.'
11917,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11918,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes, he said so,' the younger girl put in proudly. 'He said it. He told"
11919,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,them only pigs would do that.' The line nodded and dimpled one to
11920,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"another with little explosive giggles, such as children use when they"
11921,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,tell deeds of great daring against their elders.
11922,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11923,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'If you know it is wrong, that makes it much worse,' said Frau Ebermann."
11924,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11925,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Oh yes; much worse,' they assented cheerfully, till the smallest boy"
11926,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,changed his smile to a baby wail of weariness.
11927,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11928,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'When will they come for us?' he asked, and the girl at the head of the"
11929,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,row hauled him bodily into her square little capable lap.
11930,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11931,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'He's tired,' she explained. 'He is only four. He only had his first"
11932,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"breeches this spring.' They came almost under his armpits, and were held"
11933,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"up by broad linen braces, which, his sorrow diverted for the moment, he"
11934,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,patted proudly.
11935,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11936,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes, beautiful, dear,' said both girls."
11937,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11938,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Go away!' said Frau Ebermann. 'Go home to your father and mother!'
11939,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11940,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Their faces grew grave at once.
11941,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11942,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'H'sh! We _can't_,' whispered the eldest. 'There isn't anything left.'"
11943,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11944,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'All gone,' a boy echoed, and he puffed through pursed lips. 'Like"
11945,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"_that_, uncle told me. Both cows too.'"
11946,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11947,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'And my own three ducks,' the boy on the girl's lap said sleepily."
11948,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11949,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'So, you see, we came here.' The elder girl leaned forward a little,"
11950,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,caressing the child she rocked.
11951,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11952,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I--I don't understand,' said Frau Ebermann 'Are you lost, then? You"
11953,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,must tell our police.'
11954,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11955,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Oh no; we are only waiting.'
11956,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11957,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'But what are you waiting _for?_'
11958,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11959,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'We are waiting for our people to come for us. They told us to come here
11960,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"and wait for them. So we are waiting till they come,' the eldest"
11961,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,girl replied.
11962,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11963,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes. We are waiting till our people come for us,' said all the others"
11964,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,in chorus.
11965,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11966,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But,' said Frau Ebermann very patiently--'but now tell me, for I tell"
11967,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"you that I am not in the least angry, where do you come from? Where do"
11968,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you come from?'
11969,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11970,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,The five gave the names of two villages of which she had read in the
11971,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"papers,"
11972,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11973,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'That is silly,' said Frau Ebermann. 'The people fired on us, and they"
11974,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"were punished. Those places are wiped out, stamped flat.'"
11975,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11976,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes, yes, wiped out, stamped flat. That is why and--I have lost the"
11977,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"ribbon off my pigtail,' said the younger girl. She looked behind her"
11978,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,over the sofa-back.
11979,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11980,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'It is not here,' said the elder. 'It was lost before. Don't you"
11981,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,remember?'
11982,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11983,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Now, if you are lost, you must go and tell our police. They will take"
11984,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"care of you and give you food,' said Frau Ebermann. 'Anna will show you"
11985,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the way there.'
11986,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11987,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'No,'--this was the six-year-old with the smile,--'we must wait here"
11988,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"till our people come for us. Mustn't we, sister?'"
11989,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11990,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Of course. We wait here till our people come for us. All the world
11991,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"knows that,' said the eldest girl."
11992,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11993,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes.' The boy in her lap had waked again. 'Little children, too--as"
11994,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"little as Henri, and _he_ doesn't wear trousers yet. As little as"
11995,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,all that.'
11996,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
11997,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I don't understand,' said Frau Ebermann, shivering. In spite of the"
11998,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"heat of the room and the damp breath of the steam-inhaler, the aspirin"
11999,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,was not doing its duty.
12000,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12001,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,The girl raised her blue eyes and looked at the woman for an instant.
12002,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12003,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'You see,' she said, emphasising her statements with her ringers,"
12004,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'_they_ told _us_ to wait _here_ till _our_ people came for us. So we
12005,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,came. We wait till our people come for us.'
12006,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12007,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'That is silly again,' said Frau Ebermann. 'It is no good for you to"
12008,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,wait here. Do you know what this place is? You have been to school? It
12009,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"is Berlin, the capital of Germany.'"
12010,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12011,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes, yes,' they all cried; 'Berlin, capital of Germany. We know that."
12012,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,That is why we came.'
12013,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12014,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'So, you see, it is no good,' she said triumphantly, 'because your"
12015,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,people can never come for you here.'
12016,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12017,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'They told us to come here and wait till our people came for us.' They
12018,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"delivered this as if it were a lesson in school. Then they sat still,"
12019,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"their hands orderly folded on their laps, smiling as sweetly as ever."
12020,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12021,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Go away! Go away!' Frau Ebermann shrieked.
12022,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12023,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'You called?' said Anna, entering."
12024,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12025,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'No. Go away! Go away!'
12026,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12027,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Very good, old cat,' said the maid under her breath. 'Next time you"
12028,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"_may_ call,' and she returned to her friend in the kitchen."
12029,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12030,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I ask you--ask you, _please_ to go away,' Frau Ebermann pleaded. 'Go to"
12031,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"my Anna through that door, and she will give you cakes and sweeties. It"
12032,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,is not kind of you to come into my room and behave so badly.'
12033,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12034,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Where else shall we go now?' the elder girl demanded, turning to her"
12035,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,little company. They fell into discussion. One preferred the broad
12036,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"street with trees, another the railway station; but when she suggested"
12037,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"an Emperor's palace, they agreed with her."
12038,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12039,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'We will go then,' she said, and added half apologetically to Frau"
12040,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Ebermann, 'You see, they are so little they like to meet all"
12041,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the others.'
12042,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12043,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'What others?' said Frau Ebermann.
12044,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12045,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'The others--hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of the
12046,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,others.'
12047,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12048,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'That is a lie. There cannot be a hundred even, much less a thousand,'"
12049,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,cried Frau Ebermann.
12050,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12051,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'So?' said the girl politely.
12052,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12053,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Yes. _I_ tell you; and I have very good information. I know how it
12054,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,happened. You should have been more careful. You should not have run out
12055,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,to see the horses and guns passing. That is how it is done when our
12056,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,troops pass through. My son has written me so.'
12057,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12058,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"They had clambered down from the sofa, and gathered round the bed with"
12059,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"eager, interested eyes."
12060,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12061,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Horses and guns going by--how fine!' some one whispered.
12062,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12063,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes, yes; believe me, _that_ is how the accidents to the children"
12064,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,happen. You must know yourself that it is true. One runs out to look--'
12065,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12066,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But I never saw any at all,' a boy cried sorrowfully. 'Only one noise I"
12067,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,heard. That was when Aunt Emmeline's house fell down.'
12068,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12069,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But listen to me. _I_ am telling you! One runs out to look, because one"
12070,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"is little and cannot see well. So one peeps between the man's legs, and"
12071,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,then--you know how close those big horses and guns turn the
12072,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,corners--then one's foot slips and one gets run over. That's how it
12073,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"happens. Several times it had happened, but not many times; certainly"
12074,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"not a hundred, perhaps not twenty. So, you see, you _must_ be all. Tell"
12075,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"me now that you are all that there are, and Anna shall give you"
12076,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the cakes.'
12077,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12078,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Thousands,' a boy repeated monotonously. 'Then we all come here to"
12079,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,wait till our people come for us.'
12080,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12081,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But now we will go away from here. The poor lady is tired,' said the"
12082,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"elder girl, plucking his sleeve."
12083,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12084,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Oh, you hurt, you hurt!' he cried, and burst into tears."
12085,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12086,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'What is that for?' said Frau Ebermann. 'To cry in a room where a poor
12087,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,lady is sick is very inconsiderate.'
12088,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12089,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Oh, but look, lady!' said the elder girl."
12090,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12091,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Frau Ebermann looked and saw.
12092,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12093,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'_Au revoir_, lady.' They made their little smiling bows and curtseys"
12094,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"undisturbed by her loud cries. '_Au revoir,_ lady. We will wait till our"
12095,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,people come for us.'
12096,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12097,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"When Anna at last ran in, she found her mistress on her knees, busily"
12098,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"cleaning the floor with the lace cover from the radiator, because, she"
12099,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"explained, it was all spotted with the blood of five children--she was"
12100,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,perfectly certain there could not be more than five in the whole
12101,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"world--who had gone away for the moment, but were now waiting round the"
12102,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"corner, and Anna was to find them and give them cakes to stop the"
12103,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"bleeding, while her mistress swept and garnished that Our dear Lord when"
12104,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,He came might find everything as it should be.
12105,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12106,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12107,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12108,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Mary Postgate
12109,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12110,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,(1915)
12111,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12112,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Of Miss Mary Postgate, Lady McCausland wrote that she was 'thoroughly"
12113,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"conscientious, tidy, companionable, and ladylike. I am very sorry to"
12114,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"part with her, and shall always be interested in her welfare.'"
12115,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12116,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Miss Fowler engaged her on this recommendation, and to her surprise, for"
12117,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"she had had experience of companions, found that it was true. Miss"
12118,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Fowler was nearer sixty than fifty at the time, but though she needed"
12119,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"care she did not exhaust her attendant's vitality. On the contrary, she"
12120,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"gave out, stimulatingly and with reminiscences. Her father had been a"
12121,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,minor Court official in the days when the Great Exhibition of 1851 had
12122,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,just set its seal on Civilisation made perfect. Some of Miss Fowler's
12123,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"tales, none the less, were not always for the young. Mary was not young,"
12124,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"and though her speech was as colourless as her eyes or her hair, she was"
12125,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"never shocked. She listened unflinchingly to every one; said at the end,"
12126,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'How interesting!' or 'How shocking!' as the case might be, and never"
12127,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"again referred to it, for she prided herself on a trained mind, which"
12128,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'did not dwell on these things.' She was, too, a treasure at domestic"
12129,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"accounts, for which the village tradesmen, with their weekly books,"
12130,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,loved her not. Otherwise she had no enemies; provoked no jealousy even
12131,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,among the plainest; neither gossip nor slander had ever been traced to
12132,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her; she supplied the odd place at the Rector's or the Doctor's table at
12133,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,half an hour's notice; she was a sort of public aunt to very many small
12134,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"children of the village street, whose parents, while accepting"
12135,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"everything, would have been swift to resent what they called"
12136,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'patronage'; she served on the Village Nursing Committee as Miss
12137,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Fowler's nominee when Miss Fowler was crippled by rheumatoid arthritis,"
12138,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and came out of six months' fortnightly meetings equally respected by
12139,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,all the cliques.
12140,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12141,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"And when Fate threw Miss Fowler's nephew, an unlovely orphan of eleven,"
12142,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"on Miss Fowler's hands, Mary Postgate stood to her share of the business"
12143,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,of education as practised in private and public schools. She checked
12144,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"printed clothes-lists, and unitemised bills of extras; wrote to Head and"
12145,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"House masters, matrons, nurses and doctors, and grieved or rejoiced over"
12146,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,half-term reports. Young Wyndham Fowler repaid her in his holidays by
12147,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"calling her 'Gatepost,' 'Postey,' or 'Packthread,' by thumping her"
12148,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"between her narrow shoulders, or by chasing her bleating, round the"
12149,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"garden, her large mouth open, her large nose high in air, at a"
12150,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,stiff-necked shamble very like a camel's. Later on he filled the house
12151,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"with clamour, argument, and harangues as to his personal needs, likes"
12152,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"and dislikes, and the limitations of 'you women,' reducing Mary to tears"
12153,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"of physical fatigue, or, when he chose to be humorous, of helpless"
12154,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"laughter. At crises, which multiplied as he grew older, she was his"
12155,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"ambassadress and his interpretress to Miss Fowler, who had no large"
12156,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,sympathy with the young; a vote in his interest at the councils on his
12157,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"future; his sewing-woman, strictly accountable for mislaid boots and"
12158,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,garments; always his butt and his slave.
12159,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12160,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"And when he decided to become a solicitor, and had entered an office in"
12161,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"London; when his greeting had changed from 'Hullo, Postey, you old"
12162,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"beast,' to Mornin', Packthread,' there came a war which, unlike all wars"
12163,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"that Mary could remember, did not stay decently outside England and in"
12164,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the newspapers, but intruded on the lives of people whom she knew. As"
12165,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"she said to Miss Fowler, it was 'most vexatious.' It took the Rector's"
12166,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,son who was going into business with his elder brother; it took the
12167,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Colonel's nephew on the eve of fruit-farming in Canada; it took Mrs.
12168,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Grant's son who, his mother said, was devoted to the ministry; and, very"
12169,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"early indeed, it took Wynn Fowler, who announced on a postcard that he"
12170,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,had joined the Flying Corps and wanted a cardigan waistcoat.
12171,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12172,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'He must go, and he must have the waistcoat,' said Miss Fowler. So Mary"
12173,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"got the proper-sized needles and wool, while Miss Fowler told the men of"
12174,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"her establishment--two gardeners and an odd man, aged sixty--that those"
12175,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"who could join the Army had better do so. The gardeners left. Cheape,"
12176,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the odd man, stayed on, and was promoted to the gardener's cottage. The"
12177,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"cook, scorning to be limited in luxuries, also left, after a spirited"
12178,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"scene with Miss Fowler, and took the housemaid with her. Miss Fowler"
12179,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"gazetted Nellie, Cheape's seventeen-year-old daughter, to the vacant"
12180,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"post; Mrs. Cheape to the rank of cook, with occasional cleaning bouts;"
12181,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and the reduced establishment moved forward smoothly.
12182,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12183,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Wynn demanded an increase in his allowance. Miss Fowler, who always"
12184,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"looked facts in the face, said, 'He must have it. The chances are he"
12185,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"won't live long to draw it, and if three hundred makes him happy--'"
12186,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12187,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Wynn was grateful, and came over, in his tight-buttoned uniform, to say"
12188,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"so. His training centre was not thirty miles away, and his talk was so"
12189,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,technical that it had to be explained by charts of the various types of
12190,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,machines. He gave Mary such a chart.
12191,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12192,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'And you'd better study it, Postey,' he said. 'You'll be seeing a lot of"
12193,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'em soon.' So Mary studied the chart, but when Wynn next arrived to"
12194,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"swell and exalt himself before his womenfolk, she failed badly in"
12195,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"cross-examination, and he rated her as in the old days."
12196,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12197,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'You _look_ more or less like a human being,' he said in his new Service"
12198,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,voice. 'You _must_ have had a brain at some time in your past. What have
12199,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you done with it? Where d'you keep it? A sheep would know more than you
12200,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"do, Postey. You're lamentable. You are less use than an empty tin can,"
12201,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you dowey old cassowary.'
12202,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12203,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'I suppose that's how your superior officer talks to _you_?' said Miss
12204,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Fowler from her chair.
12205,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12206,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But Postey doesn't mind,' Wynn replied. 'Do you, Packthread?'"
12207,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12208,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Why? Was Wynn saying anything? I shall get this right next time you
12209,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"come,' she muttered, and knitted her pale brows again over the diagrams"
12210,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"of Taubes, Farmans, and Zeppelins."
12211,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12212,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,In a few weeks the mere land and sea battles which she read to Miss
12213,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Fowler after breakfast passed her like idle breath. Her heart and her
12214,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"interest were high in the air with Wynn, who had finished 'rolling'"
12215,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,(whatever that might be) and had gone on from a 'taxi' to a machine more
12216,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"or less his own. One morning it circled over their very chimneys,"
12217,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"alighted on Vegg's Heath, almost outside the garden gate, and Wynn came"
12218,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"in, blue with cold, shouting for food. He and she drew Miss Fowler's"
12219,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"bath-chair, as they had often done, along the Heath foot-path to look at"
12220,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the bi-plane. Mary observed that 'it smelt very badly.'
12221,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12222,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Postey, I believe you think with your nose,' said Wynn. 'I know you"
12223,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"don't with your mind. Now, what type's that?'"
12224,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12225,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I'll go and get the chart,' said Mary."
12226,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12227,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'You're hopeless! You haven't the mental capacity of a white mouse,' he"
12228,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"cried, and explained the dials and the sockets for bomb-dropping till it"
12229,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,was time to mount and ride the wet clouds once more.
12230,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12231,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Ah!' said Mary, as the stinking thing flared upward. 'Wait till our"
12232,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Flying Corps gets to work! Wynn says it's much safer than in the
12233,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,trenches.'
12234,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12235,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I wonder,' said Miss Fowler. 'Tell Cheape to come and tow me home"
12236,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,again.'
12237,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12238,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'It's all downhill. I can do it,' said Mary, 'if you put the brake on.'"
12239,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,She laid her lean self against the pushing-bar and home they trundled.
12240,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12241,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Now, be careful you aren't heated and catch a chill,' said overdressed"
12242,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Miss Fowler.
12243,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12244,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Nothing makes me perspire,' said Mary. As she bumped the chair under"
12245,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the porch she straightened her long back. The exertion had given her a
12246,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"colour, and the wind had loosened a wisp of hair across her forehead."
12247,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Miss Fowler glanced at her.
12248,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12249,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'What do you ever think of, Mary?' she demanded suddenly."
12250,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12251,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Oh, Wynn says he wants another three pairs of stockings--as thick as we"
12252,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,can make them.'
12253,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12254,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes. But I mean the things that women think about. Here you are, more"
12255,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,than forty--'
12256,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12257,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Forty-four,' said truthful Mary."
12258,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12259,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Well?'
12260,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12261,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Well?' Mary offered Miss Fowler her shoulder as usual.
12262,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12263,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'And you've been with me ten years now.'
12264,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12265,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Let's see,' said Mary. 'Wynn was eleven when he came. He's twenty now,"
12266,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and I came two years before that. It must be eleven.'
12267,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12268,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Eleven! And you've never told me anything that matters in all that
12269,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"while. Looking back, it seems to me that _I_'ve done all the talking.'"
12270,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12271,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I'm afraid I'm not much of a conversationalist. As Wynn says, I haven't"
12272,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the mind. Let me take your hat.'
12273,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12274,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Miss Fowler, moving stiffly from the hip, stamped her rubber-tipped"
12275,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"stick on the tiled hall floor. 'Mary, aren't you _anything_ except a"
12276,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,companion? Would you _ever_ have been anything except a companion?'
12277,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12278,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Mary hung up the garden hat on its proper peg. 'No,' she said after"
12279,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"consideration. 'I don't imagine I ever should. But I've no imagination,"
12280,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,I'm afraid.'
12281,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12282,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,She fetched Miss Fowler her eleven-o'clock glass of ContrexÃ©ville.
12283,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12284,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"That was the wet December when it rained six inches to the month, and"
12285,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the women went abroad as little as might be. Wynn's flying chariot
12286,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"visited them several times, and for two mornings (he had warned her by"
12287,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,postcard) Mary heard the thresh of his propellers at dawn. The second
12288,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"time she ran to the window, and stared at the whitening sky. A little"
12289,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,blur passed overhead. She lifted her lean arms towards it.
12290,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12291,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,That evening at six o'clock there came an announcement in an official
12292,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,envelope that Second Lieutenant W. Fowler had been killed during a trial
12293,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,flight. Death was instantaneous. She read it and carried it to
12294,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Miss Fowler.
12295,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12296,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I never expected anything else,' said Miss Fowler; 'but I'm sorry it"
12297,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,happened before he had done anything.'
12298,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12299,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"The room was whirling round Mary Postgate, but she found herself quite"
12300,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,steady in the midst of it.
12301,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12302,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes,' she said. 'It's a great pity he didn't die in action after he had"
12303,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,killed somebody.'
12304,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12305,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'He was killed instantly. That's one comfort,' Miss Fowler went on."
12306,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12307,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'But Wynn says the shock of a fall kills a man at once--whatever happens
12308,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"to the tanks,' quoted Mary."
12309,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12310,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"The room was coming to rest now. She heard Miss Fowler say impatiently,"
12311,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But why can't we cry, Mary?' and herself replying, 'There's nothing to"
12312,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,cry for. He has done his duty as much as Mrs. Grant's son did.'
12313,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12314,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'And when he died, _she_ came and cried all the morning,' said Miss"
12315,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Fowler. 'This only makes me feel tired--terribly tired. Will you help me
12316,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"to bed, please, Mary?--And I think I'd like the hot-water bottle.'"
12317,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12318,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"So Mary helped her and sat beside, talking of Wynn in his riotous youth."
12319,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12320,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I believe,' said Miss Fowler suddenly, 'that old people and young"
12321,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,people slip from under a stroke like this. The middle-aged feel
12322,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,it most.'
12323,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12324,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I expect that's true,' said Mary, rising. 'I'm going to put away the"
12325,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,things in his room now. Shall we wear mourning?'
12326,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12327,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Certainly not,' said Miss Fowler. 'Except, of course, at the funeral. I"
12328,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,can't go. You will. I want you to arrange about his being buried here.
12329,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,What a blessing it didn't happen at Salisbury!'
12330,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12331,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Every one, from the Authorities of the Flying Corps to the Rector, was"
12332,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,most kind and sympathetic. Mary found herself for the moment in a world
12333,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,where bodies were in the habit of being despatched by all sorts of
12334,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,conveyances to all sorts of places. And at the funeral two young men in
12335,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,buttoned-up uniforms stood beside the grave and spoke to her afterwards.
12336,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12337,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'You're Miss Postgate, aren't you?' said one. 'Fowler told me about you."
12338,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,He was a good chap--a first-class fellow--a great loss.'
12339,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12340,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Great loss!' growled his companion. 'We're all awfully sorry.'
12341,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12342,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'How high did he fall from?' Mary whispered.
12343,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12344,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Pretty nearly four thousand feet, I should think, didn't he? You were"
12345,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"up that day, Monkey?'"
12346,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12347,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'All of that,' the other child replied. 'My bar made three thousand, and"
12348,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,I wasn't as high as him by a lot.'
12349,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12350,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Then _that's_ all right,' said Mary. 'Thank you very much.'"
12351,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12352,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,They moved away as Mrs. Grant flung herself weeping on Mary's flat
12353,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"chest, under the lych-gate, and cried, '_I_ know how it feels! _I_ know"
12354,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,how it feels!'
12355,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12356,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But both his parents are dead,' Mary returned, as she fended her off."
12357,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Perhaps they've all met by now,' she added vaguely as she escaped"
12358,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,towards the coach.
12359,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12360,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I've thought of that too,' wailed Mrs. Grant; 'but then he'll be"
12361,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,practically a stranger to them. Quite embarrassing!'
12362,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12363,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Mary faithfully reported every detail of the ceremony to Miss Fowler,"
12364,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"who, when she described Mrs. Grant's outburst, laughed aloud."
12365,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12366,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Oh, how Wynn would have enjoyed it! He was always utterly unreliable at"
12367,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"funerals. D'you remember--' And they talked of him again, each piecing"
12368,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"out the other's gaps. 'And now,' said Miss Fowler, 'we'll pull up the"
12369,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,blinds and we'll have a general tidy. That always does us good. Have you
12370,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,seen to Wynn's things?'
12371,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12372,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Everything--since he first came,' said Mary. 'He was never"
12373,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,destructive--even with his toys.'
12374,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12375,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,They faced that neat room.
12376,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12377,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'It can't be natural not to cry,' Mary said at last. 'I'm _so_ afraid"
12378,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you'll have a reaction.'
12379,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12380,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'As I told you, we old people slip from under the stroke. It's you I'm"
12381,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,afraid for. Have you cried yet?'
12382,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12383,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'I can't. It only makes me angry with the Germans.'
12384,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12385,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'That's sheer waste of vitality,' said Miss Fowler. 'We must live till"
12386,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the war's finished.' She opened a full wardrobe. 'Now, I've been"
12387,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,thinking things over. This is my plan. All his civilian clothes can be
12388,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"given away--Belgian refugees, and so on.'"
12389,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12390,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Mary nodded. 'Boots, collars, and gloves?'"
12391,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12392,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Yes. We don't need to keep anything except his cap and belt.'
12393,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12394,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'They came back yesterday with his Flying Corps clothes'--Mary pointed
12395,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,to a roll on the little iron bed.
12396,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12397,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Ah, but keep his Service things. Some one may be glad of them later. Do"
12398,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you remember his sizes?'
12399,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12400,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Five feet eight and a half; thirty-six inches round the chest. But he
12401,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,told me he's just put on an inch and a half. I'll mark it on a label and
12402,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,tie it on his sleeping-bag.'
12403,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12404,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'So that disposes of _that_,' said Miss Fowler, tapping the palm of one"
12405,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,hand with the ringed third finger of the other. 'What waste it all is!
12406,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,We'll get his old school trunk to-morrow and pack his civilian clothes.'
12407,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12408,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'And the rest?' said Mary. 'His books and pictures and the games and the
12409,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,toys--and--and the rest?'
12410,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12411,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'My plan is to burn every single thing,' said Miss Fowler. 'Then we"
12412,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,shall know where they are and no one can handle them afterwards. What do
12413,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,you think?'
12414,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12415,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I think that would be much the best,' said Mary. 'But there's such a"
12416,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,lot of them.'
12417,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12418,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'We'll burn them in the destructor,' said Miss Fowler."
12419,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12420,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,This was an open-air furnace for the consumption of refuse; a little
12421,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,circular four-foot tower of pierced brick over an iron grating. Miss
12422,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Fowler had noticed the design in a gardening journal years ago, and had"
12423,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"had it built at the bottom of the garden. It suited her tidy soul, for"
12424,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"it saved unsightly rubbish-heaps, and the ashes lightened the stiff"
12425,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,clay soil.
12426,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12427,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Mary considered for a moment, saw her way clear, and nodded again. They"
12428,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"spent the evening putting away well-remembered civilian suits,"
12429,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"underclothes that Mary had marked, and the regiments of very gaudy socks"
12430,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"and ties. A second trunk was needed, and, after that, a little"
12431,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"packing-case, and it was late next day when Cheape and the local carrier"
12432,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"lifted them to the cart. The Rector luckily knew of a friend's son,"
12433,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"about five feet eight and a half inches high, to whom a complete Flying"
12434,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Corps outfit would be most acceptable, and sent his gardener's son down"
12435,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,with a barrow to take delivery of it. The cap was hung up in Miss
12436,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Fowler's bedroom, the belt in Miss Postgate's; for, as Miss Fowler said,"
12437,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,they had no desire to make tea-party talk of them.
12438,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12439,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'That disposes of _that_,' said Miss Fowler. 'I'll leave the rest to"
12440,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"you, Mary. I can't run up and down the garden. You'd better take the big"
12441,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,clothes-basket and get Nellie to help you.'
12442,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12443,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I shall take the wheel-barrow and do it myself,' said Mary, and for"
12444,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,once in her life closed her mouth.
12445,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12446,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Miss Fowler, in moments of irritation, had called Mary deadly"
12447,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,methodical. She put on her oldest waterproof and gardening-hat and her
12448,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"ever-slipping goloshes, for the weather was on the edge of more rain."
12449,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"She gathered fire-lighters from the kitchen, a half-scuttle of coals,"
12450,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and a faggot of brushwood. These she wheeled in the barrow down the
12451,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,mossed paths to the dank little laurel shrubbery where the destructor
12452,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,stood under the drip of three oaks. She climbed the wire fence into the
12453,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Rector's glebe just behind, and from his tenant's rick pulled two large"
12454,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"armfuls of good hay, which she spread neatly on the fire-bars. Next,"
12455,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"journey by journey, passing Miss Fowler's white face at the morning-room"
12456,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"window each time, she brought down in the towel-covered clothes-basket,"
12457,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"on the wheel-barrow, thumbed and used Hentys, Marryats, Levers,"
12458,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Stevensons, Baroness Orczys, Garvices, schoolbooks, and atlases,"
12459,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"unrelated piles of the _Motor Cyclist_, the _Light Car_, and catalogues"
12460,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,of Olympia Exhibitions; the remnants of a fleet of sailing-ships from
12461,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,ninepenny cutters to a three-guinea yacht; a prep.-school dressing-gown;
12462,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,bats from three-and-sixpence to twenty-four shillings; cricket and
12463,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,tennis balls; disintegrated steam and clockwork locomotives with their
12464,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,twisted rails; a grey and red tin model of a submarine; a dumb
12465,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,gramophone and cracked records; golf-clubs that had to be broken across
12466,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the knee, like his walking-sticks, and an assegai; photographs of"
12467,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"private and public school cricket and football elevens, and his O.T.C."
12468,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"on the line of march; kodaks, and film-rolls; some pewters, and one real"
12469,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"silver cup, for boxing competitions and Junior Hurdles; sheaves of"
12470,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,school photographs; Miss Fowler's photograph; her own which he had borne
12471,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,off in fun and (good care she took not to ask!) had never returned; a
12472,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"playbox with a secret drawer; a load of flannels, belts, and jerseys,"
12473,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and a pair of spiked shoes unearthed in the attic; a packet of all the
12474,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"letters that Miss Fowler and she had ever written to him, kept for some"
12475,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,absurd reason through all these years; a five-day attempt at a diary;
12476,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"framed pictures of racing motors in full Brooklands career, and load"
12477,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"upon load of undistinguishable wreckage of tool-boxes, rabbit-hutches,"
12478,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"electric batteries, tin soldiers, fret-saw outfits, and jig-saw puzzles."
12479,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12480,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Miss Fowler at the window watched her come and go, and said to herself,"
12481,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Mary's an old woman. I never realised it before.'
12482,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12483,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,After lunch she recommended her to rest.
12484,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12485,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I'm not in the least tired,' said Mary. 'I've got it all arranged. I'm"
12486,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,going to the village at two o'clock for some paraffin. Nellie hasn't
12487,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"enough, and the walk will do me good.'"
12488,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12489,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"She made one last quest round the house before she started, and found"
12490,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,that she had overlooked nothing. It began to mist as soon as she had
12491,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"skirted Vegg's Heath, where Wynn used to descend--it seemed to her that"
12492,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"she could almost hear the beat of his propellers overhead, but there was"
12493,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,nothing to see. She hoisted her umbrella and lunged into the blind wet
12494,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,till she had reached the shelter of the empty village. As she came out
12495,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,of Mr. Kidd's shop with a bottle full of paraffin in her string
12496,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"shopping-bag, she met Nurse Eden, the village nurse, and fell into talk"
12497,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"with her, as usual, about the village children. They were just parting"
12498,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"opposite the 'Royal Oak,' when a gun, they fancied, was fired"
12499,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,immediately behind the house. It was followed by a child's shriek dying
12500,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,into a wail.
12501,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12502,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Accident!' said Nurse Eden promptly, and dashed through the empty bar,"
12503,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"followed by Mary. They found Mrs. Gerritt, the publican's wife, who"
12504,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"could only gasp and point to the yard, where a little cart-lodge was"
12505,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,sliding sideways amid a clatter of tiles. Nurse Eden snatched up a sheet
12506,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"drying before the fire, ran out, lifted something from the ground, and"
12507,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,flung the sheet round it. The sheet turned scarlet and half her uniform
12508,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"too, as she bore the load into the kitchen. It was little Edna Gerritt,"
12509,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"aged nine, whom Mary had known since her perambulator days."
12510,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12511,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Am I hurted bad?' Edna asked, and died between Nurse Eden's dripping"
12512,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"hands. The sheet fell aside and for an instant, before she could shut"
12513,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"her eyes, Mary saw the ripped and shredded body."
12514,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12515,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'It's a wonder she spoke at all,' said Nurse Eden. 'What in God's name"
12516,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,was it?'
12517,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12518,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'A bomb,' said Mary."
12519,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12520,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'One o' the Zeppelins?'
12521,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12522,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'No. An aeroplane. I thought I heard it on the Heath, but I fancied it"
12523,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,was one of ours. It must have shut off its engines as it came down.
12524,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,That's why we didn't notice it.'
12525,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12526,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'The filthy pigs!' said Nurse Eden, all white and shaken. 'See the"
12527,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"pickle I'm in! Go and tell Dr. Hennis, Miss Postgate.' Nurse looked at"
12528,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the mother, who had dropped face down on the floor. 'She's only in a"
12529,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,fit. Turn her over.'
12530,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12531,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Mary heaved Mrs. Gerritt right side up, and hurried off for the doctor."
12532,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"When she told her tale, he asked her to sit down in the surgery till he"
12533,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,got her something.
12534,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12535,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'But I don't need it, I assure you,' said she. 'I don't think it would"
12536,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"be wise to tell Miss Fowler about it, do you? Her heart is so irritable"
12537,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,in this weather.'
12538,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12539,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Dr. Hennis looked at her admiringly as he packed up his bag.
12540,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12541,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'No. Don't tell anybody till we're sure,' he said, and hastened to the"
12542,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Royal Oak,' while Mary went on with the paraffin. The village behind"
12543,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"her was as quiet as usual, for the news had not yet spread. She frowned"
12544,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"a little to herself, her large nostrils expanded uglily, and from time"
12545,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"to time she muttered a phrase which Wynn, who never restrained himself"
12546,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"before his womenfolk, had applied to the enemy. 'Bloody pagans! They"
12547,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"_are_ bloody pagans. But,' she continued, falling back on the teaching"
12548,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"that had made her what she was, 'one mustn't let one's mind dwell on"
12549,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,these things.'
12550,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12551,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Before she reached the house Dr. Hennis, who was also a special"
12552,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"constable, overtook her in his car."
12553,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12554,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Oh, Miss Postgate,' he said, 'I wanted to tell you that that accident"
12555,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"at the ""Royal Oak"" was due to Gerritt's stable tumbling down. It's been"
12556,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,dangerous for a long time. It ought to have been condemned.'
12557,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12558,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I thought I heard an explosion too,' said Mary."
12559,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12560,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'You might have been misled by the beams snapping. I've been looking at
12561,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'em. They were dry-rotted through and through. Of course, as they broke,"
12562,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,they would make a noise just like a gun.'
12563,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12564,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'Yes?' said Mary politely.
12565,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12566,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Poor little Edna was playing underneath it,' he went on, still holding"
12567,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"her with his eyes, 'and that and the tiles cut her to pieces, you see?'"
12568,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12569,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I saw it,' said Mary, shaking her head. 'I heard it too.'"
12570,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12571,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Well, we cannot be sure.' Dr. Hennis changed his tone completely. 'I"
12572,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,know both you and Nurse Eden (I've been speaking to her) are perfectly
12573,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"trustworthy, and I can rely on you not to say anything--yet at least. It"
12574,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,is no good to stir up people unless--'
12575,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12576,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Oh, I never do--anyhow,' said Mary, and Dr. Hennis went on to the"
12577,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,county town.
12578,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12579,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"After all, she told herself, it might, just possibly, have been the"
12580,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,collapse of the old stable that had done all those things to poor little
12581,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Edna. She was sorry she had even hinted at other things, but Nurse Eden"
12582,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,was discretion itself. By the time she reached home the affair seemed
12583,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"increasingly remote by its very monstrosity. As she came in, Miss Fowler"
12584,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,told her that a couple of aeroplanes had passed half an hour ago.
12585,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12586,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'I thought I heard them,' she replied, 'I'm going down to the garden"
12587,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,now. I've got the paraffin.'
12588,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12589,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Yes, but--what _have_ you got on your boots? They're soaking wet."
12590,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Change them at once.'
12591,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12592,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Not only did Mary obey but she wrapped the boots in a newspaper, and"
12593,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"put them into the string bag with the bottle. So, armed with the longest"
12594,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"kitchen poker, she left."
12595,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12596,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'It's raining again,' was Miss Fowler's last word, 'but--I know you"
12597,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,won't be happy till that's disposed of.'
12598,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12599,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'It won't take long. I've got everything down there, and I've put the"
12600,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,lid on the destructor to keep the wet out.'
12601,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12602,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,The shrubbery was filling with twilight by the time she had completed
12603,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her arrangements and sprinkled the sacrificial oil. As she lit the match
12604,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"that would burn her heart to ashes, she heard a groan or a grunt behind"
12605,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the dense Portugal laurels.
12606,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12607,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Cheape?' she called impatiently, but Cheape, with his ancient lumbago,"
12608,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,in his comfortable cottage would be the last man to profane the
12609,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"sanctuary. 'Sheep,' she concluded, and threw in the fusee. The pyre went"
12610,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"up in a roar, and the immediate flame hastened night around her."
12611,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12612,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'How Wynn would have loved this!' she thought, stepping back from the"
12613,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,blaze.
12614,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12615,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"By its light she saw, half hidden behind a laurel not five paces away, a"
12616,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,bareheaded man sitting very stiffly at the foot of one of the oaks. A
12617,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,broken branch lay across his lap--one booted leg protruding from beneath
12618,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"it. His head moved ceaselessly from side to side, but his body was as"
12619,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,still as the tree's trunk. He was dressed--she moved sideways to look
12620,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"more closely--in a uniform something like Wynn's, with a flap buttoned"
12621,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"across the chest. For an instant, she had some idea that it might be"
12622,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,one of the young flying men she had met at the funeral. But their heads
12623,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"were dark and glossy. This man's was as pale as a baby's, and so closely"
12624,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,cropped that she could see the disgusting pinky skin beneath. His
12625,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,lips moved.
12626,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12627,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'What do you say?' Mary moved towards him and stooped.
12628,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12629,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Laty! Laty! Laty!' he muttered, while his hands picked at the dead wet"
12630,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,leaves. There was no doubt as to his nationality. It made her so angry
12631,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"that she strode back to the destructor, though it was still too hot to"
12632,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,use the poker there. Wynn's books seemed to be catching well. She looked
12633,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,up at the oak behind the man; several of the light upper and two or
12634,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,three rotten lower branches had broken and scattered their rubbish on
12635,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"the shrubbery path. On the lowest fork a helmet with dependent strings,"
12636,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,showed like a bird's-nest in the light of a long-tongued flame.
12637,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Evidently this person had fallen through the tree. Wynn had told her
12638,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,that it was quite possible for people to fall out of aeroplanes. Wynn
12639,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"told her too, that trees were useful things to break an aviator's fall,"
12640,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,but in this case the aviator must have been broken or he would have
12641,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,moved from his queer position. He seemed helpless except for his
12642,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"horrible rolling head. On the other hand, she could see a pistol case at"
12643,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"his belt--and Mary loathed pistols. Months ago, after reading certain"
12644,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Belgian reports together, she and Miss Fowler had had dealings with"
12645,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"one--a huge revolver with flat-nosed bullets, which latter, Wynn said,"
12646,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,were forbidden by the rules of war to be used against civilised
12647,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"enemies. 'They're good enough for us,' Miss Fowler had replied. 'Show"
12648,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Mary how it works.' And Wynn, laughing at the mere possibility of any"
12649,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"such need, had led the craven winking Mary into the Rector's disused"
12650,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"quarry, and had shown her how to fire the terrible machine. It lay now"
12651,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,in the top-left-hand drawer of her toilet-table--a memento not included
12652,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,in the burning. Wynn would be pleased to see how she was not afraid.
12653,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12654,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"She slipped up to the house to get it. When she came through the rain,"
12655,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,the eyes in the head were alive with expectation. The mouth even tried
12656,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,to smile. But at sight of the revolver its corners went down just like
12657,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Edna Gerritt's. A tear trickled from one eye, and the head rolled from"
12658,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,shoulder to shoulder as though trying to point out something.
12659,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12660,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'CassÃ©e. Tout cassÃ©e,' it whimpered."
12661,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12662,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'What do you say?' said Mary disgustedly, keeping well to one side,"
12663,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,though only the head moved.
12664,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12665,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'CassÃ©e,' it repeated. 'Che me rends. Le mÃ©dicin! Toctor!'"
12666,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12667,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Nein!' said she, bringing all her small German to bear with the big"
12668,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,pistol. 'Ich haben der todt Kinder gesehn.'
12669,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12670,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,The head was still. Mary's hand dropped. She had been careful to keep
12671,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her finger off the trigger for fear of accidents. After a few moments'
12672,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"waiting, she returned to the destructor, where the flames were falling,"
12673,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and churned up Wynn's charring books with the poker. Again the head
12674,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,groaned for the doctor.
12675,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12676,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Stop that!' said Mary, and stamped her foot. 'Stop that, you bloody"
12677,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,pagan!'
12678,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12679,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"The words came quite smoothly and naturally. They were Wynn's own words,"
12680,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,and Wynn was a gentleman who for no consideration on earth would have
12681,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,torn little Edna into those vividly coloured strips and strings. But
12682,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,this thing hunched under the oak-tree had done that thing. It was no
12683,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,question of reading horrors out of newspapers to Miss Fowler. Mary had
12684,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,seen it with her own eyes on the 'Royal Oak' kitchen table. She must not
12685,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"allow her mind to dwell upon it. Now Wynn was dead, and everything"
12686,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,connected with him was lumping and rustling and tinkling under her busy
12687,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,poker into red black dust and grey leaves of ash. The thing beneath the
12688,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,oak would die too. Mary had seen death more than once. She came of a
12689,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"family that had a knack of dying under, as she told Miss Fowler, 'most"
12690,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,distressing circumstances.' She would stay where she was till she was
12691,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,entirely satisfied that It was dead--dead as dear papa in the late
12692,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,'eighties; aunt Mary in eighty-nine; mamma in 'ninety-one; cousin Dick
12693,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,in ninety-five; Lady McCausland's housemaid in 'ninety-nine; Lady
12694,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,McCausland's sister in nineteen hundred and one; Wynn buried five days
12695,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,ago; and Edna Gerritt still waiting for decent earth to hide her. As she
12696,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"thought--her underlip caught up by one faded canine, brows knit and"
12697,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,nostrils wide--she wielded the poker with lunges that jarred the grating
12698,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"at the bottom, and careful scrapes round the brick-work above. She"
12699,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"looked at her wrist-watch. It was getting on to half-past four, and the"
12700,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,rain was coming down in earnest. Tea would be at five. If It did not die
12701,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"before that time, she would be soaked and would have to change."
12702,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"Meantime, and this occupied her, Wynn's things were burning well in"
12703,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"spite of the hissing wet, though now and again a book-back with a quite"
12704,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,distinguishable title would be heaved up out of the mass. The exercise
12705,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,of stoking had given her a glow which seemed to reach to the marrow of
12706,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her bones. She hummed--Mary never had a voice--to herself. She had never
12707,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,believed in all those advanced views--though Miss Fowler herself leaned
12708,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,a little that way--of woman's work in the world; but now she saw there
12709,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"was much to be said for them. This, for instance, was _her_ work--work"
12710,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"which no man, least of all Dr. Hennis, would ever have done. A man, at"
12711,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"such a crisis, would be what Wynn called a 'sportsman'; would leave"
12712,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"everything to fetch help, and would certainly bring It into the house."
12713,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Now a woman's business was to make a happy home for--for a husband and
12714,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,children. Failing these--it was not a thing one should allow one's mind
12715,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,to dwell upon--but--
12716,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12717,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Stop it!' Mary cried once more across the shadows. 'Nein, I tell you!"
12718,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Ich haben der todt Kinder gesehn.'
12719,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12720,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,_But_ it was a fact. A woman who had missed these things could still be
12721,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,useful--more useful than a man in certain respects. She thumped like a
12722,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,pavior through the settling ashes at the secret thrill of it. The rain
12723,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"was damping the fire, but she could feel--it was too dark to see--that"
12724,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,her work was done. There was a dull red glow at the bottom of the
12725,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"destructor, not enough to char the wooden lid if she slipped it half"
12726,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"over against the driving wet. This arranged, she leaned on the poker and"
12727,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"waited, while an increasing rapture laid hold on her. She ceased to"
12728,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,think. She gave herself up to feel. Her long pleasure was broken by a
12729,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,sound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life. She
12730,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"leaned forward and listened, smiling. There could be no mistake. She"
12731,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,closed her eyes and drank it in. Once it ceased abruptly.
12732,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12733,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"'Go on,' she murmured, half aloud. 'That isn't the end.'"
12734,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,
12735,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Then the end came very distinctly in a lull between two rain-gusts. Mary
12736,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,Postgate drew her breath short between her teeth and shivered from head
12737,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"to foot. '_That's_ all right,' said she contentedly, and went up to the"
12738,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"house, where she scandalised the whole routine by taking a luxurious hot"
12739,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"bath before tea, and came down looking, as Miss Fowler said when she saw"
12740,THE SONG OF SEVEN CITIES,"her lying all relaxed on the other sofa, 'quite handsome!'"
