232,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,WILLIAM HABINGTON.
233,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
234,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
235,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,This poet might have been expected to have belonged to the 'Spasmodic
236,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"school,' judging by his parental antecedents. His father was accused of"
237,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"having a share in Babington's conspiracy, but was released because he"
238,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"was godson to Queen Elizabeth. Soon after, however, he was imprisoned a"
239,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"second time, and condemned to death on the charge of having concealed"
240,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,some of the Gunpowder-plot conspirators; but was pardoned through the
241,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"interest of Lord Morley. His uncle, however, was less fortunate,"
242,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"suffering death for his complicity with Babington. The poet's mother,"
243,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"the daughter of Lord Morley, was more loyal than her husband or his"
244,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"brother, and is said to have written the celebrated letter to Lord"
245,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Monteagle, in consequence of which the execution of the Gunpowder-plot"
246,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,was arrested.
247,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
248,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Our poet was born at Hindlip, Worcestershire, on the very day of the"
249,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"discovery of the plot, 5th November 1605. The family were Papists, and"
250,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,William was sent to St Omers to be educated. He was pressed to become
251,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"a Jesuit, but declined. On his return to England, his father became"
252,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"preceptor to the poet. As he grew up, instead of displaying any taste"
253,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"for 'treasons, stratagems, and spoils,' he chose the better part, and"
254,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"lived a private and happy life. He fell in love with Lucia, daughter of"
255,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"William Herbert, the first Lord Powis, and celebrated her in his long"
256,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"and curious poem entitled 'Castara.' This lady he afterwards married,"
257,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"and from her society appears to have derived much happiness. In 1634,"
258,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"he published 'Castara.' He also, at different times, produced 'The Queen"
259,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"of Arragon,' a tragedy; a History of Edward IV.; and 'Observations upon"
260,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"History.' He died in 1654, (not as Southey, by a strange oversight,"
261,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"says, 'when he had just completed his fortieth year,') forty-nine years"
262,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"of age, and was buried in the family vault at Hindlip."
263,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
264,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"'Castara' is not a consecutive poem, but consists of a great variety of"
265,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"small pieces, in all sorts of style and rhythm, and of all varieties of"
266,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"merit; many of them addressed to his mistress under the name of Castara,"
267,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"and many to his friends; with reflective poems, elegies, and panegyrics,"
268,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,intermingled with verses sacred to love. Habington is distinguished by
269,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"purity of tone if not of taste. He has many conceits, but no obscenities."
270,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"His love is as holy as it is ardent. He has, besides, a vein of sentiment"
271,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"which sometimes approaches the moral sublime. To prove this, in addition"
272,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"to the 'Selections' below, we copy some verses entitled--"
273,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
274,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
275,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,'NOX NOCTI INDICAT SCIENTIAM.'--_David_.
276,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
277,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,When I survey the bright
278,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Celestial sphere,"
279,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"So rich with jewels hung, that Night"
280,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Doth like an Ethiop bride appear,"
281,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
282,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"My soul her wings doth spread,"
283,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And heavenward flies,"
284,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,The Almighty's mysteries to read
285,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,In the large volume of the skies;
286,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
287,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,For the bright firmament
288,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Shoots forth no flame
289,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"So silent, but is eloquent"
290,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,In speaking the Creator's name.
291,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
292,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,No unregarded star
293,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Contracts its light
294,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Into so small a character,"
295,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Removed far from our human sight,"
296,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
297,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"But if we steadfast look,"
298,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,We shall discern
299,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"In it, as in some holy book,"
300,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,How man may heavenly knowledge learn.
301,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
302,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,It tells the conqueror
303,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"That far-stretch'd power,"
304,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Which his proud dangers traffic for,"
305,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Is but the triumph of an hour;
306,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
307,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"That, from the furthest North,"
308,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Some nation may,"
309,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Yet undiscover'd, issue forth,"
310,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And o'er his new-got conquest sway,--"
311,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
312,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Some nation, yet shut in"
313,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"With hills of ice,"
314,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,May be let out to scourge his sin
315,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Till they shall equal him in vice;
316,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
317,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,And then they likewise shall
318,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,Their ruin brave;
319,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"For, as yourselves, your empires fall,"
320,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,_And every kingdom hath a grave_.
321,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
322,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Thus those celestial fires,"
323,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"Though seeming mute,"
324,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"The fallacy of our desires,"
325,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And all the pride of life, confute;"
326,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
327,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,For they have watch'd since first
328,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"The world had birth,"
329,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"And found sin in itself accurst,"
330,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,And nothing permanent on earth.
331,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
332,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,
333,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,There is something to us particularly interesting in the history of this
334,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,poet. Even as it is pleasant to see the sides of a volcano covered with
335,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"verdure, and its mouth filled with flowers, so we like to find the"
336,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"fierce elements, which were inherited by Habington from his fathers,"
337,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"softened and subdued in him,--the blood of the conspirator mellowed into"
338,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,"that of the gentle bard, who derived all his inspiration from a pure"
339,WILLIAM HABINGTON.,love and a mild and thoughtful religion.

360,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,What should we covet here? Why interpose
361,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,A cloud 'twixt us and heaven? Kind Nature chose
362,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,"Man's soul the exchequer where to hoard her wealth,"

367,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,"A gentle season, when the seas and winds"
368,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,"Are silenced by a calm, and then brings forth"
369,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,"The happy miracle of her rare birth,"
370,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,"Leaving with wonder all our arts possess'd,"
371,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,That view the architecture of her nest.

376,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,Folly! what dost thou in thy power contain

379,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,By avarice in the possession poor.
380,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,And yet that idol wealth we all admit

382,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,"Invents new orgies, fancy frames new rites"

384,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,Are watch'd to win its favour: while the beast

386,EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE W.E.,"Let man then boast no more a soul, since he"

549,THE MORNING STAR.,"John's more celebrated namesake, Joseph, was born at Bristowe Park,"
550,THE MORNING STAR.,"parish of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, in 1574. He studied and"
551,THE MORNING STAR.,took orders at Cambridge. He acted for some time as master of the school
552,THE MORNING STAR.,"of Tiverton, in Devonshire. It is said that the accidental preaching of"
553,THE MORNING STAR.,a sermon before Prince Henry first attracted attention to this eminent
554,THE MORNING STAR.,divine. Promotion followed with a sure and steady course. He was chosen
555,THE MORNING STAR.,"to accompany King James to Scotland as one of his chaplains, and"
556,THE MORNING STAR.,subsequently attended the famous Synod of Dort as a representative of
557,THE MORNING STAR.,"the English Church. He had before this, while quite a young man, (in"
558,THE MORNING STAR.,"1597,) published, under the title of 'Virgidemiarum,' his Satires. In"
559,THE MORNING STAR.,"the year 1600 he produced a satirical fiction, entitled, 'Mundus alter"
560,THE MORNING STAR.,"et idem;' in which, while pretending to describe a certain _terra"
561,THE MORNING STAR.,"australis incognita_, he hits hard at the existent evils of the actual"
562,THE MORNING STAR.,"world. Hall was subsequently created Bishop of Exeter, where he exposed"
563,THE MORNING STAR.,"himself to obloquy by his mildness to the Puritans. 'Had,' Campbell"
564,THE MORNING STAR.,"justly remarked, 'such conduct been, at this critical period, pursued by"
565,THE MORNING STAR.,"the High Churchmen in general, the history of a bloody age might have"
566,THE MORNING STAR.,been changed into that of peace; but the violence of Laud prevailed over
567,THE MORNING STAR.,"the milder counsels of a Hall, an Usher, and a Corbet.' Yet Hall was a"
568,THE MORNING STAR.,"zealous Episcopalian, and defended that form of government in a variety"
569,THE MORNING STAR.,of pamphlets. In the course of this controversy he carne in collision
570,THE MORNING STAR.,"with the mighty Milton himself, who, unable to deny the ability and"
571,THE MORNING STAR.,"learning of his opponent, tried to cover him with a deluge of derision."
572,THE MORNING STAR.,
573,THE MORNING STAR.,"Besides these pamphlets, the Bishop produced a number of Epistles"
574,THE MORNING STAR.,"in prose, of Sermons, of Paraphrases, and a remarkable series of"
575,THE MORNING STAR.,"'Occasional Meditations,' which became soon, and continue to be,"
576,THE MORNING STAR.,popular.
577,THE MORNING STAR.,
578,THE MORNING STAR.,"Hall, who had in his early days struggled hard with narrow circumstances"
579,THE MORNING STAR.,"and neglect, seemed to reach the climax of prosperity when he was, in"
580,THE MORNING STAR.,"1641, created by the King Bishop of Norwich. But having, soon after,"
581,THE MORNING STAR.,unfortunately added his name to the Protest of the twelve prelates
582,THE MORNING STAR.,against the authority of any laws which should be passed during their
583,THE MORNING STAR.,"compulsory absence from Parliament, he was thrown into the Tower, and"
584,THE MORNING STAR.,subsequently threatened with sequestration. After enduring great
585,THE MORNING STAR.,"privations, he at last was permitted to retire to Higham, near Norwich,"
586,THE MORNING STAR.,"where, reduced to a very miserable allowance, he continued to labour as"
587,THE MORNING STAR.,"a pastor, with unwearied assiduity, till, in 1656, death closed his"
588,THE MORNING STAR.,"eyes, at the advanced age of eighty-two. Bishop Hall, if not fully"
589,THE MORNING STAR.,"competent to mate with Milton, was nevertheless a giant, conspicuous"
590,THE MORNING STAR.,even in an age when giants were rife. He has been called the Christian
591,THE MORNING STAR.,"Seneca, from the pith and clear sententiousness of his prose style. His"
592,THE MORNING STAR.,"'Meditations,' ranging over almost the whole compass of Scripture, as"
593,THE MORNING STAR.,"well as an incredible variety of ordinary topics, are distinguished by"
594,THE MORNING STAR.,"their fertile fancy, their glowing language, and by thought which, if"
595,THE MORNING STAR.,"seldom profound, is never commonplace, and seems always the spontaneous"
596,THE MORNING STAR.,and easy outcome of the author's mind. In no form of composition does
597,THE MORNING STAR.,excellence depend more on spontaneity than in the meditation. The ruin
598,THE MORNING STAR.,"of such writers as Hervey, and, to some extent, Boyle, has been, that"
599,THE MORNING STAR.,they seem to have set themselves elaborately and convulsively to extract
600,THE MORNING STAR.,"sentiment out of every object which met their eye. They seem to say,"
601,THE MORNING STAR.,"'We will, and we must meditate, whether the objects be interesting or"
602,THE MORNING STAR.,"not, and whether our own moods be propitious to the exercise, or the"
603,THE MORNING STAR.,"reverse.' Hence have come exaggeration, extravagance, and that shape"
604,THE MORNING STAR.,"of the ridiculous which mimics the sublime, and has been so admirably"
605,THE MORNING STAR.,"exposed in Swift's 'Meditation on a Broomstick.' Hall's method is, in"
606,THE MORNING STAR.,"general, the opposite of this. The objects on which he muses seem to"
607,THE MORNING STAR.,"have sought him, and not he them. He surrounds himself with his thoughts"
608,THE MORNING STAR.,"unconsciously, as one gathers burs and other herbage about him by the"
609,THE MORNING STAR.,"mere act of walking in the woods. Sometimes, indeed, he is quaint and"
610,THE MORNING STAR.,"fantastic, as in his meditation"

639,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',Hall fulfilled one test of lofty genius: he was in several departments
640,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',an originator. He first gave an example of epistolary composition in
641,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"prose,--an example the imitation of which has produced many of the most"
642,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"interesting, instructive, and beautiful writings in the language. He"
643,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"is our first popular author of Meditations and Contemplations, and a"
644,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"large school has followed in his path--too often, in truth, _passibus"
645,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',iniquis_. And he is unquestionably the father of British satire. It is
646,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',remarkable that all his satires were written in youth. Too often the
647,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',satirical spirit grows in authors with the advance of life; and it is a
648,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"pitiful sight, that of those who have passed the meridian of years and"
649,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"reputation, grinning back in helpless mockery and toothless laughter"
650,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"upon the brilliant way they have traversed, but to which they can return"
651,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"no more. Hall, on the other hand, exhausted long ere he was thirty the"
652,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"sarcastic material that was in him; and during the rest of his career,"
653,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',wielded his powers with as much lenity as strength.
654,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',
655,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',Perhaps no satirist had a more thorough conception than our author of
656,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',what is the real mission of satire in the moral history of mankind;
657,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"--_that_ is, to shew vice its own image--to scourge impudent imposture"
658,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',--to expose hypocrisy--to laugh down solemn quackery of every kind--to
659,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',create blushes on brazen brows and fears of scorn in hollow hearts--to
660,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"make iniquity, as ashamed, hide its face--to apply caustic, nay cautery,"
661,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',to the sores of society--and to destroy sin by shewing both the ridicule
662,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',which attaches to its progress and the wretched consequences which are
663,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',its end. But various causes prevented him from fully realising his own
664,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"ideal, and thus becoming the best as well as the first of our satirical"
665,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"poets. His style--imitated from Persius and Juvenal--is too elliptical,"
666,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',and it becomes true of him as well as of Persius that his points are
667,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',often sheathed through the remoteness of his allusions and the perplexity
668,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"of his diction. He is very recondite in his images, and you are sometimes"
669,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"reminded of one storming in English at a Hindoo--it is pointless fury,"
670,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',boltless thunder. At other times the stream of his satiric vein flows
671,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"on with a blended clearness and energy, which has commanded the warm"
672,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"encomium of Campbell, and which prompted the diligent study of Pope."
673,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',There is more courage required in attacking the follies than the vices of
674,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"an age, and Hall shews a peculiar daring when he derides the vulgar forms"
675,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"of astrology and alchymy which were then prevalent, and the wretched"
676,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',fustian which infected the language both of literature and the stage.
677,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"Whatever be the merits or defects of Hall's satires, the world is"
678,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',indebted to him as the founder of a school which were itself sufficient
679,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"to cover British literature with glory, and which, in the course of ages,"
680,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"has included such writers as Samuel Butler, with his keen sense of the"

683,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"form of versification, seemingly shaped by the Genius of Satire for his"
684,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"own purposes, and resembling heroic rhyme broken off in the middle by"
685,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"shouts of laughter;--Dryden, with the ease, the _animus_, and the"
686,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',masterly force of his satirical dissections--the vein of humour which
687,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',is stealthily visible at times in the intervals of his wrathful  mood
688,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"--and the occasional passing and profound touches, worthy of Juvenal,"
689,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"and reminding one of the fires of Egypt, which ran along the ground,"
690,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',scorching all things while they pursued their unabated speed;--the
691,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"spirit of satire, strong as death, and cruel as the grave, which became"
692,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"incarnate in Swift;--Pope,  with his minute and microscopic vision"
693,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"of human infirmities, his polish, delicate strokes, damning hints,"
694,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"and annihilating whispers, where 'more is meant than meets the ear;'"

699,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',and genius--the spirit of a _caird_ with that of a poet--which marked all
700,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"his satirical pieces;--Crabbe, with his caustic vein and sternly-literal"
701,'UPON HEARING OF MUSIC BY NIGHT.',"descriptions, behind which are seen, half-skulking from view, kindness,"

873,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
874,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
875,RICHARD LOVELACE.,This unlucky cavalier and bard was born in 1618. He was the son of Sir
876,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"William Lovelace, of Woolwich, in Kent. He was educated some say at"
877,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Oxford, and others at Cambridge--took a master's degree, and was"
878,RICHARD LOVELACE.,afterwards presented at Court. Anthony Wood thus describes his personal
879,RICHARD LOVELACE.,appearance at the age of sixteen:--'He was the most amiable and
880,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"beautiful person that eye ever beheld,--a person also of innate modesty,"
881,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"virtue, and courtly deportment, which made him then, but especially"
882,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"after when he retired to the great city, much admired and adored by the"
883,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"fair sex.' Soon after this, he was chosen by the county of Kent to"
884,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"deliver a petition from the inhabitants to the House of Commons, praying"
885,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"them to restore the King to his rights, and to settle the government."
886,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Such offence was given by this to the Long Parliament, that Lovelace was"
887,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"thrown into prison, and only liberated on heavy bail. His paternal"
888,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"estate, which amounted to £500 a-year, was soon exhausted in his efforts"
889,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"to promote the royal cause. In 1646, he formed a regiment for the"
890,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"service of the King of France, became its colonel, and was wounded at"
891,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Dunkirk. Ere leaving England, he had formed a strong attachment to a"
892,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Miss Lucy Sacheverell, and had written much poetry in her praise,"
893,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"designating her as _Lux-Casta_. Unfortunately, hearing a report that"
894,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Lovelace had died at Dunkirk of his wounds, she married another, so"
895,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"that, on his return home in 1648, he met a deep disappointment; and to"
896,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"complete his misery, the ruling powers cast him again into prison, where"
897,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"he lay till the death of Charles. Like some other men of genius, he"
898,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"beguiled his confinement by literary employment; and in 1649, he"
899,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"published a book under the title of 'Lucasta,' consisting of odes,"
900,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"sonnets, songs, and miscellaneous poems, most of which had been"
901,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"previously composed. After the execution of the King, he was liberated;"
902,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"but his funds were exhausted, his heart broken, and his constitution"
903,RICHARD LOVELACE.,probably injured. He gradually sunk; and Wood says that he became very
904,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"poor in body and purse, was the object of charity, 'went in ragged"
905,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"clothes, and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty places.' Alas for the"
906,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Adonis of sixteen, the beloved of Lucasta, and the envied of all! Some"
907,RICHARD LOVELACE.,have doubted these stories about his extreme poverty; and one of his
908,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"biographers asserts, that his daughter and sole heir (but who, pray, was"
909,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"his wife and her mother?) married the son of Lord Chief-Justice Coke,"
910,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"and brought to her husband the estates of her father at Kingsdown, in"
911,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Kent. Aubrey however, corroborates the statements of Wood; and, at all"
912,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"events, Lovelace seems to have died, in 1658, in a wretched alley near"
913,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Shoe Lane.
914,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
915,RICHARD LOVELACE.,There is not much to be said about his poetry. It may be compared to his
916,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"person--beautiful, but dressed in a stiff mode. We do not, in every"
917,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"point, homologate the opinions of Prynne, as to the 'unloveliness of"
918,RICHARD LOVELACE.,love-locks;' but we do certainly look with a mixture of contempt and
919,RICHARD LOVELACE.,pity on the self-imposed trammels of affectation in style and manner
920,RICHARD LOVELACE.,which bound many of the poets of that period. The wits of Charles II.
921,RICHARD LOVELACE.,were more disgustingly licentious; but their very carelessness saved
922,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"them from the conceits of their predecessors; and, while lowering the"
923,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"tone of morality, they raised unwittingly the standard of taste. Some of"
924,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"the songs of Lovelace, however, such as 'To Althea, from Prison,' are"
925,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"exquisitely simple, as well as pure. Sir Egerton Brydges has found out"
926,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"that Byron, in one of his be-praised  paradoxical beauties, either"
927,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"copied, or coincided with, our poet. In the 'Bride of Abydos' he says of"
928,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Zuleika--
929,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
930,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"'The mind, the _music_ breathing from her face.'"
931,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
932,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Lovelace had, long before, in the song of 'Orpheus Mourning for his"
933,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Wife,' employed the words--"
934,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
935,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"'Oh, could you view the melody"
936,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"Of every grace,"
937,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"And _music of her face_,"
938,RICHARD LOVELACE.,You'd drop a tear;
939,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Seeing more harmony
940,RICHARD LOVELACE.,In her bright eye
941,RICHARD LOVELACE.,Than now you hear.'
942,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
943,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"While many have praised, others have called this idea nonsense;"
944,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"although, if we are permitted to speak of the harmony of the tones of a"
945,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"cloud, why not of the harmony produced by the consenting lines of a"
946,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"countenance, where every grace melts into another, and the various"
947,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"features and expressions fluctuate into a fine whole? Whatever, whether"
948,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"it be the beauty of the human face, or the quiet lustre of statuary, or"
949,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"the mild glory of moonlight, gives the effects of music, and, like that"
950,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"divine art,"
951,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
952,RICHARD LOVELACE.,"'Pours on mortals a beautiful disdain,'"
953,RICHARD LOVELACE.,
954,RICHARD LOVELACE.,may surely become music's metaphor and poetic analogy.

1085,ROBERT HERRICK.,
1086,ROBERT HERRICK.,"This poet--a bird with tropical plumage, and norland sweetness of song"
1087,ROBERT HERRICK.,"--was born in Cheapside, London, in 1591. His father, was an eminent"
1088,ROBERT HERRICK.,goldsmith. Herrick was sent to Cambridge; and having entered into holy
1089,ROBERT HERRICK.,"orders, and being patronised by the Earl of Exeter, he was, in 1629,"
1090,ROBERT HERRICK.,"presented by Charles I. to the vicarage of Dean Prior, in Devonshire."
1091,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Here he resided for twenty years, till ejected by the civil war. He"
1092,ROBERT HERRICK.,seems all this time to have felt little relish either for his profession
1093,ROBERT HERRICK.,"or parishioners. In the former, the cast of his poems shews that he must"
1094,ROBERT HERRICK.,have been 'detained before the Lord;' and the latter he describes as a
1095,ROBERT HERRICK.,"'wild, amphibious race,' rude almost as 'salvages,' and 'churlish as the"
1096,ROBERT HERRICK.,"seas.' When he quitted his charge, he became an author at the mature age"
1097,ROBERT HERRICK.,"of fifty-six--publishing first, in 1647, his 'Noble Numbers; or, Pious"
1098,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Pieces;' and next, in 1648, his 'Hesperides; or, Works both Human and"
1099,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Divine of Robert Herrick, Esq.'--his ministerial prefix being now laid"
1100,ROBERT HERRICK.,aside. Some of these poems were sufficiently unclerical--being wild and
1101,ROBERT HERRICK.,"licentious in cast--although he himself alleges that his life was,"
1102,ROBERT HERRICK.,"sexually at least, blameless. Till the Restoration he lived in Westminster,"
1103,ROBERT HERRICK.,"supported by the rich among the Royalists, and keeping company with the"
1104,ROBERT HERRICK.,popular dramatists and poets. It would seem that he had been in the habit
1105,ROBERT HERRICK.,"of visiting London previously, while still acting as a clergyman, and had"
1106,ROBERT HERRICK.,become a boon companion of Ben Jonson. Hence his well-known lines--
1107,ROBERT HERRICK.,

1131,ROBERT HERRICK.,"replaced in his old charge, and seems to have spent the rest of his life"
1132,ROBERT HERRICK.,"quietly in the country, enjoying the fresh air and the old English"
1133,ROBERT HERRICK.,"sports--'repenting at leisure moments,' as Shakspeare has it, of the"
1134,ROBERT HERRICK.,"early pruriencies of his muse; or, as the same immortal bard says of"
1135,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Falstaff, 'patching up his old body' for a better place. The date of his"
1136,ROBERT HERRICK.,death is not exactly ascertained; but he seems to have got considerably
1137,ROBERT HERRICK.,to the shady side of seventy years of age.
1138,ROBERT HERRICK.,
1139,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Herrick's poetry was for a long time little known, till worthy Nathan"
1140,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Drake, in his 'Literary Hours,' performed to him, as to some others,"
1141,ROBERT HERRICK.,the part of a friendly resurrectionist. He may be called the English
1142,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Anacreon, and resembles the Greek poet, not only in graceful, lively,"
1143,ROBERT HERRICK.,"and voluptuous elegance and richness, but also in that deeper sentiment"
1144,ROBERT HERRICK.,which often underlies the lighter surface of his verse. It is a great
1145,ROBERT HERRICK.,mistake to suppose that Anacreon was a mere contented sensualist and
1146,ROBERT HERRICK.,"shallow songster of love and wine. Some of his odes shew that, if he"
1147,ROBERT HERRICK.,"yielded to the destiny of being a Cicada, singing amidst the vines of"
1148,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Bacchus, it was despair--the despair produced by a degraded age and a"
1149,ROBERT HERRICK.,bad religion--which reduced him to the necessity. He was by nature an
1150,ROBERT HERRICK.,eagle; but he was an eagle in a sky where there was no sun. The cry of
1151,ROBERT HERRICK.,"a noble being, placed in the most untoward circumstances, is here and"
1152,ROBERT HERRICK.,"there heard in his verses, and reminds you of the voice of one of the"
1153,ROBERT HERRICK.,"transmuted victims of Circe, or of Ariel from that cloven pine, where he"
1154,ROBERT HERRICK.,
1155,ROBERT HERRICK.,'howl'd away twelve winters.'
1156,ROBERT HERRICK.,
1157,ROBERT HERRICK.,"Herrick might be by constitution a voluptuary,--and he has unquestionably"
1158,ROBERT HERRICK.,"degraded his genius in not a few of his rhymes,--but in him, as well as"
1159,ROBERT HERRICK.,"in Anacreon, Horace, and Burns, there lay a better and a higher nature,"
1160,ROBERT HERRICK.,"which the critics have ignored, because it has not found a frequent or"
1161,ROBERT HERRICK.,full utterance in his poetry. In proof that our author possessed profound
1162,ROBERT HERRICK.,"sentiment, mingling and sometimes half-lost in the loose, luxuriant"
1163,ROBERT HERRICK.,"leafage of his imagery, we need only refer our readers to his 'Blossoms'"
1164,ROBERT HERRICK.,"and his 'Daffodils.' Besides gaiety and gracefulness, his verse is"
1165,ROBERT HERRICK.,exceedingly musical--his lines not only move but dance.

1812,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"son's education, and influence to get him admitted as a king's scholar"
1813,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"into Westminster. His mind was almost preternaturally precocious, and"
1814,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,received early a strong and peculiar stimulus. A copy of Spenser lay in
1815,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the window of his mother's apartment, and in it he delighted to read,"
1816,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,and became the devoted slave of poetry ever after. When only ten he
1817,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"wrote 'The Tragical History of Pyramus and Thisbe,' and at twelve"
1818,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,'Constantia and Philetus.' Pope wrote a lampoon about the same age as
1819,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Cowley these romantic narratives; and we have seen a pretty good copy of
1820,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"verses on Napoleon, written at the age of seven, by one of the most"
1821,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,distinguished rising poets of our own day. When fifteen (Johnson calls
1822,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"it thirteen, but he and some other biographers were misled by the"
1823,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"portrait of the poet being, by mistake, marked thirteen) Cowley"
1824,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"published some of his early effusions, under the title of 'Poetical"
1825,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Blossoms.' While at school he produced a comedy of a pastoral kind,"
1826,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"entitled, 'Love's Riddle,' but it was not published till he went to"
1827,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Cambridge. To that university he proceeded in 1636, and two years after,"
1828,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"there appeared the above-mentioned comedy, with a poetical dedication to"
1829,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Sir Kenelm Digby, one of the marvellous men of that age; and also"
1830,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Naufragium Joculare,' a comedy in Latin, inscribed to Dr Comber, master"
1831,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"of the college. When the Prince of Wales afterwards visited Cambridge,"
1832,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the fertile Cowley got up the rough draft of another comedy, called 'The"
1833,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Guardian,' which was repeated to His Royal Highness by the scholars."
1834,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"This was afterwards, to the poet's great annoyance, printed during his"
1835,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"absence from the country. In 1643 he took his degree of A.M., and was,"
1836,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the same year, through the prevailing influence of the Parliament,"
1837,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"ejected, with many others, from Cambridge. He took refuge in St John's"
1838,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"College, Oxford, where he published a satire, entitled 'The Puritan and"
1839,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Papist,' and where, by his loyalty and genius, he gained the favour of"
1840,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,such distinguished courtiers as Lord Falkland. During this agitated
1841,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,period he resided a good deal in the family of the Lord St Albans; and
1842,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,when Oxford fell into the hands of the Parliament he followed the Queen
1843,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to Paris, and there acted as Secretary to the same noble lord. He"
1844,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"remained abroad about ten years, and during that period made various"
1845,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"journeys in the furtherance of the Royal cause, visiting Flanders,"
1846,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Holland, Jersey, Scotland, &c. His chief employment, however, was"
1847,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,carrying on a correspondence in cipher between the King and the Queen.
1848,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Sprat says, 'he ciphered and deciphered with his own hand the greatest"
1849,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"part of the letters that passed between their Majesties, and managed a"
1850,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"vast intelligence in other parts, which, for some years together, took"
1851,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,up all his days and two or three nights every week.' This does not seem
1852,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"employment very suitable to a man of genius. He seems, however, to have"
1853,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"found time for more congenial avocations; and, in 1647, he published his"
1854,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Mistress,' a work which seems to glow with amorous fire, although"
1855,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Barnes relates of the author that he was never in love but once, and"
1856,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,then had not resolution to reveal his passion. And yet he wrote 'The
1857,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Chronicle,' from which we might infer that his heart was completely"
1858,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"tinder, and that his series of love attachments had been an infinite"
1859,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,one!
1860,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
1861,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"In 1556, being of no more use in Paris, Cowley was sent back to England,"
1862,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,that 'under pretence of privacy and retirement he might take occasion of
1863,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,giving notice of the posture of things in this nation.' For some time he
1864,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"lay concealed in London, but was at length seized by mistake for another"
1865,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"gentleman of the Royal party; and being thus discovered, he was continued"
1866,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"in confinement, was several times examined, and ultimately succeeded,"
1867,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"although with some difficulty, in obtaining his liberation, Dr Scarborough"
1868,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,becoming his bail for a thousand pounds. In the same year he published a
1869,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"collection of his poems, with a querulous preface, in which he expresses"
1870,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"a strong desire to 'retire to some of the American plantations, and to"
1871,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,forsake the world for ever.' Meanwhile he gave himself out as a physician
1872,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"till the death of Cromwell, when he returned to France, resumed his former"
1873,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"occupation, and remained till the Restoration. In 1657 he was created"
1874,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Doctor of Medicine at Oxford. Having studied botany to qualify himself for
1875,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"his physician's degree, he was induced to publish in Latin some books on"
1876,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"plants, flowers, and trees."
1877,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
1878,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,The Restoration brought him less advantage than he had anticipated.
1879,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Probably he expected too much, and had expressed his sanguine hopes in a"
1880,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"song of triumph on the occasion. He had been promised, both by Charles"
1881,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"I. and Charles II., the Mastership of the Savoy, (a forgotten sinecure"
1882,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"office;) but lost it, says Wood, 'by certain persons, enemies to the"
1883,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Muses.' He brought on the stage at this time his old comedy of 'The
1884,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Guardian,' under the title of 'Cutter of Coleman Street;' but it was"
1885,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"thought a satire on the debauchery of the King's party, and was received"
1886,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"with coldness. Cowley, according to Dryden, 'received the news of his"
1887,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,ill success not with so much firmness as might have been expected from
1888,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"so great a man.' There are few who, like Dr Johnson, have been able to"
1889,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"declare, after the rejection of a play or poem, that they felt 'like the"
1890,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Monument.' Cowley not only entertained, but printed his dissatisfaction,"
1891,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"in the form of a poem called 'The Complaint,' which, like all selfish"
1892,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"complaints, attracted little sympathy or attention. In this he calls"
1893,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"himself the 'melancholy Cowley,' an epithet which has stuck to his"
1894,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,memory.
1895,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
1896,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"He had always, according to his own statement, loved retirement. When he"
1897,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"was a young boy at school, instead of running about on holidays, and"
1898,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"playing with his fellows, he was wont to steal from them, and walk into"
1899,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the fields alone with a book. This passion had been overlaid, but not"
1900,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"extinguished, during his public life; and now, swelled by disgust, it"
1901,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"came back upon him in great strength. He seems, too, if we can believe"
1902,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Sprat, to have had an extraordinary attachment to Nature, as it 'was"
1903,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"God's;' to the whole 'compass of the creation, and all the wonderful"
1904,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"effects of the Divine wisdom.' At all events, he retired first to Barn"
1905,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Elms, and then to Chertsey in Surrey. He had obtained, through Lord St"
1906,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Albans and the Duke of Buckingham, the lease of some lands belonging to"
1907,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the Queen, which brought him in an income of £300 a year. Here, then,"
1908,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"having, at the age of forty-two, reached the peaceful hermitage,' he set"
1909,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"himself with all his might to enjoy it. He cultivated his fields, and"
1910,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,renewed his botanical studies in his woods and garden. He wrote letters
1911,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to his friends, which are said to have been admirable, and might have"
1912,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"ranked with those of Gray and Cowper, but unfortunately they have not"
1913,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"been preserved. He renewed his intimacy with the Greek and Latin poets,"
1914,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"and he set himself to retouch the 'Davideis,' which he had begun in"
1915,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"early youth, but which he never lived to finish, and to compose his"
1916,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"beautiful prose essays. But he soon found that Chertsey, no more than"
1917,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Paris, was Paradise. He had no wife nor children. He had sweet solitude,"
1918,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,but no one near him to whom to whisper 'how sweet this solitude is!' The
1919,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"peasants were boors. His tenants would pay him no rent, and the cattle"
1920,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,of his neighbours devoured his meadows. He was troubled with rheums and
1921,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"colds. He met a severe fall when he first came to Chertsey, of which he"
1922,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"says, half in jest and half in earnest--'What this signifies, or may"
1923,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"come to in time, God knows; if it be ominous, it can end in nothing less"
1924,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,than hanging.' Robert Hall said of Bishop Watson that he seemed to have
1925,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"wedded political integrity in early life, and to have spent all the rest"
1926,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,of his days in quarrelling with his wife. So Cowley wedded his long-
1927,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"sought-for bride, Solitude, and led a miserable life with her ever"
1928,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"after. Fortunately for him, if not for the world, his career soon came"
1929,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,to a close.
1930,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
1931,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"One hot day in summer, he stayed too long among his labourers in the"
1932,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"meadows, and was seized with a cold, which, being neglected, carried him"
1933,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,off on the 28th of July 1667. He was not forty-nine years old. He died
1934,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"at the Porch House, Chertsey, and his remains were buried with great"
1935,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"pomp near Chaucer and Spenser; and King Charles, who had neglected him"
1936,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"during life, pronounced his panegyric after death, declaring that 'Mr"
1937,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Cowley had not left behind him a better man in England.' It was in
1938,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,keeping with the character of Charles to make up for his deficiency in
1939,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"action, by his felicity of phrase."
1940,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
1941,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"If we may differ from such a high authority as 'Old Rowley,' we would"
1942,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,venture to doubt whether Cowley was the best--certainly he was not the
1943,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"greatest--man then in England. Milton was alive, and the 'Paradise Lost'"
1944,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,appeared in the very year when the author of the 'Davideis' departed.
1945,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Cowley gives us the impression of having been an amiable and blameless,"
1946,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"rather than a good or great man. At all events, there was nothing"
1947,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"_active_ in his goodness, and his greatness could not be called"
1948,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,magnanimity. He was a scholar and a poet misplaced during early life;
1949,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"and when he gained that retirement for which he sighed, he had, by his"
1950,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"habits of life, lost his capacity of relishing it. 'He that would enjoy"
1951,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"solitude,' it has been said, 'must either be a wild beast or a god;' and"
1952,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,Cowley was neither. How different his grounds of dissatisfaction with
1953,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"the world from those of Milton! Cowley was wearied of ciphering, and his"
1954,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,'Cutter of Coleman Street' had been cut; that was nearly the whole
1955,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,matter of his complaint; while Milton had fallen from being the second
1956,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"man in England into poverty, blindness, contempt, danger, and the"
1957,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,disappointment of the most glorious hopes which ever heaved the bosom of
1958,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,patriot or saint.
1959,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
1960,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,We find the want of greatness which marked the man characterising the
1961,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"poet. Infinite ingenuity, a charming flexibility and abundance of fancy,"
1962,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"a perception of remote analogies almost unrivalled, great command of"
1963,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"versification and language, learning without bounds, and an occasional"
1964,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,gracefulness and sparkling ease (as in 'The Chronicle') superior to even
1965,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Herrick or Suckling, are qualities that must be conceded to Cowley. But"
1966,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,the most of his writings are cold and glittering as the sun-smitten
1967,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"glacier. He is seldom warm, except when he is proclaiming his own"
1968,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"merits, or bewailing his own misfortunes. Hence his 'Wish,' and even his"
1969,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Complaint,' are very pleasing and natural specimens of poetry. But his"
1970,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"'Pindaric Odes,' his 'Hymn to Light,' and most of his 'Davideis,' while"
1971,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"displaying great power, shew at least equal perversion, and are more"
1972,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"memorable for their faults than for their beauties. In the 'Davideis,'"
1973,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,he describes the attire of Gabriel in the spirit and language of a
1974,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,tailor; and there is no path so sacred or so lofty but he must sow it
1975,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"with conceits,--forced, false, and chilly. His 'Anacreontics,' on the"
1976,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"other hand, are in general felicitous in style and aerial in motion. And"
1977,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"in his Translations, although too free, he is uniformly graceful and"
1978,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,spirited; and his vast command of language and imagery enables him often
1979,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to improve his author--to gild the refined gold, to paint the lily, and"
1980,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"to throw a new perfume on the violet, of the Grecian and Roman masters."
1981,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,
1982,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"In prose, Cowley is uniformly excellent. The prefaces to his poems,"
1983,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"especially his defence of sacred song in the prefix to the 'Davideis,'"
1984,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"his short autobiography, the fragments of his letters which remain, and"
1985,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"his posthumous essays, are all distinguished by a rich simplicity of"
1986,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,style and by a copiousness of matter which excite in equal measure
1987,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"delight and surprise. He had written, it appears, three books on the"
1988,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"Civil War, to the time of the battle of Newbury, which he destroyed. It"
1989,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"is a pity, perhaps, that he had not preserved and completed the work."
1990,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,His intimacy with many of the leading characters and the secret springs
1991,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"of that remarkable period,--his clear and solid judgment, always so"
1992,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,except when he was following the Daedalus Pindar upon waxen Icarian
1993,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"wings, or competing with Dr Donne in the number of conceits which he"
1994,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"could stuff, like cloves, into his subject-matter,--and the bewitching"
1995,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"ease and elegance of his prose style, would have combined to render it"
1996,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,"an important contribution to English history, and a worthy monument of"
1997,ABRAHAM COWLEY.,its author's highly-accomplished and diversified powers.

2919,THE CONTENTS.,And covered half the plain; still hears the sound
2920,THE CONTENTS.,"How that vast monster fell, and strook the around:"
2921,THE CONTENTS.,"The dance, and, David his ten thousand slew,"
2922,THE CONTENTS.,"Still wound his sickly soul, and still are new."
2923,THE CONTENTS.,"Great acts t' ambitious princes treason grow,"
2924,THE CONTENTS.,So much they hate that safety which they owe.
2925,THE CONTENTS.,Tyrants dread all whom they raise high in place;
2926,THE CONTENTS.,"From the good danger, from the bad disgrace."
2927,THE CONTENTS.,"They doubt the lords, mistrust the people's hate,"
2928,THE CONTENTS.,Till blood become a principle of state.
2929,THE CONTENTS.,"Secured not by their guards nor by their right,"
2930,THE CONTENTS.,"But still they fear even more than they affright,"
2931,THE CONTENTS.,"Pardon me, sir; your father's rough and stern;"
2932,THE CONTENTS.,"His will too strong to bend, too proud to learn."
2933,THE CONTENTS.,"Remember, sir, the honey's deadly sting!"
2934,THE CONTENTS.,"Think on that savage justice of the King,"
2935,THE CONTENTS.,When the same day that saw you do before
2936,THE CONTENTS.,"Things above man, should see you man no more."
2937,THE CONTENTS.,"'Tis true, the accursed Agag moved his ruth;"
2938,THE CONTENTS.,He pitied his tall limbs and comely youth;
2939,THE CONTENTS.,"Had seen, alas! the proof of Heaven's fierce hate,"
2940,THE CONTENTS.,And feared no mischief from his powerless fate;
2941,THE CONTENTS.,"Remember how the old seer came raging down,"
2942,THE CONTENTS.,And taught him boldly to suspect his crown.
2943,THE CONTENTS.,"Since then, his pride quakes at the Almighty's rod,"
2944,THE CONTENTS.,Nor dares he love the man beloved by God.
2945,THE CONTENTS.,Hence his deep rage and trembling envy springs;
2946,THE CONTENTS.,Nothing so wild as jealousy of kings.
2947,THE CONTENTS.,"Whom should he counsel ask, with whom advise,"
2948,THE CONTENTS.,Who reason and God's counsel does despise?
2949,THE CONTENTS.,"Whose headstrong will no law or conscience daunt,"
2950,THE CONTENTS.,"Dares he not sin, do you think, without your grant?"
2951,THE CONTENTS.,"Yes, if the truth of our fixed love he knew,"
2952,THE CONTENTS.,"He would not doubt, believe it, to kill even you.'"
2953,THE CONTENTS.,
2954,THE CONTENTS.,"The prince is moved, and straight prepares to find"
2955,THE CONTENTS.,The deep resolves of his grieved father's mind.
2956,THE CONTENTS.,"The danger now appears, love can soon show it,"
2957,THE CONTENTS.,And force his stubborn piety to know it.
2958,THE CONTENTS.,"They agree that David should concealed abide,"
2959,THE CONTENTS.,Till his great friend had the Court's temper tried;
2960,THE CONTENTS.,"Till he had Saul's most sacred purpose found,"
2961,THE CONTENTS.,And searched the depth and rancour of his wound.
2962,THE CONTENTS.,
2963,THE CONTENTS.,"'Twas the year's seventh-born moon; the solemn feast,"
2964,THE CONTENTS.,That with most noise its sacred mirth express'd.
2965,THE CONTENTS.,"From opening morn till night shuts in the day,"
2966,THE CONTENTS.,On trumpets and shrill horns the Levites play:
2967,THE CONTENTS.,Whether by this in mystic type we see
2968,THE CONTENTS.,"The new-year's day of great eternity,"
2969,THE CONTENTS.,"When the changed moon shall no more changes make,"
2970,THE CONTENTS.,And scattered death's by trumpets' sound awake;
2971,THE CONTENTS.,"Or that the law be kept in memory still,"
2972,THE CONTENTS.,Given with like noise on Sinai's shining hill;
2973,THE CONTENTS.,Or that (as some men teach) it did arise
2974,THE CONTENTS.,"From faithful Abram's righteous sacrifice,"
2975,THE CONTENTS.,"Who, whilst the ram on Isaac's fire did fry,"
2976,THE CONTENTS.,His horn with joyful tunes stood sounding by;
2977,THE CONTENTS.,"Obscure the cause, but God his will declared,"
2978,THE CONTENTS.,And all nice knowledge then with ease is spared.
2979,THE CONTENTS.,"At the third hour Saul to the hallowed tent,"
2980,THE CONTENTS.,"'Midst a large train of priests and courtiers, went;"
2981,THE CONTENTS.,"The sacred herd marched proud and softly by,"
2982,THE CONTENTS.,Too fat and gay to think their deaths so nigh.
2983,THE CONTENTS.,Hard fate of beasts more innocent than we!
2984,THE CONTENTS.,Prey to our luxury and our piety!
2985,THE CONTENTS.,"Whose guiltless blood on boards and altars spilt,"
2986,THE CONTENTS.,"Serves both to make and expiate, too, our guilt!"
2987,THE CONTENTS.,"Three bullocks of free neck, two gilded rams,"
2988,THE CONTENTS.,"Two well-washed goats, and fourteen spotless lambs,"
2989,THE CONTENTS.,"With the three vital fruits, wine, oil, and bread,"
2990,THE CONTENTS.,(Small fees to Heaven of all by which we're fed)
2991,THE CONTENTS.,"Are offered up: the hallowed flames arise,"
2992,THE CONTENTS.,And faithful prayers mount with them to the skies.
2993,THE CONTENTS.,"From thence the King to the utmost court is brought,"
2994,THE CONTENTS.,"Where heavenly things an inspired prophet taught,"
2995,THE CONTENTS.,"And from the sacred tent to his palace gates,"
2996,THE CONTENTS.,With glad kind shouts the assembly on him waits;
2997,THE CONTENTS.,"The cheerful horns before him loudly play,"
2998,THE CONTENTS.,And fresh-strewed flowers paint his triumphant way.
2999,THE CONTENTS.,"Thus in slow pace to the palace-hall they go,"
3000,THE CONTENTS.,Rich dressed for solemn luxury and show:
3001,THE CONTENTS.,"Ten pieces of bright tapestry hung the room,"
3002,THE CONTENTS.,"The noblest work e'er stretched on Syrian loom,"
3003,THE CONTENTS.,"For wealthy Adriel in proud Sidon wrought,"
3004,THE CONTENTS.,"And given to Saul when Saul's best gift he sought,"
3005,THE CONTENTS.,The bright-eyed Merab; for that mindful day
3006,THE CONTENTS.,No ornament so proper seemed as they.
3007,THE CONTENTS.,
3008,THE CONTENTS.,"There all old Abram's story you might see,"
3009,THE CONTENTS.,And still some angel bore him company.
3010,THE CONTENTS.,His painful but well-guided travels show
3011,THE CONTENTS.,"The fate of all his sons, the church below."
3012,THE CONTENTS.,Here beauteous Sarah to great Pharaoh came;
3013,THE CONTENTS.,"He blushed with sudden passion, she with shame:"
3014,THE CONTENTS.,"Troubled she seemed, and labouring in the strife,"
3015,THE CONTENTS.,'Twixt her own honour and her husband's life.
3016,THE CONTENTS.,"Here on a conquering host, that careless lay,"
3017,THE CONTENTS.,"Drowned in the joys of their new-gotten prey,"
3018,THE CONTENTS.,The patriarch falls; well-mingled might you see
3019,THE CONTENTS.,The confused marks of death and luxury.
3020,THE CONTENTS.,In the next piece bless'd Salem's mystic king
3021,THE CONTENTS.,Does sacred presents to the victor bring;
3022,THE CONTENTS.,"Like Him whose type he bears, his rights receives,"
3023,THE CONTENTS.,"Strictly requires his due, yet freely gives:"
3024,THE CONTENTS.,"Even in his port, his habit, and his face,"
3025,THE CONTENTS.,"The mild and great, the priest and prince, had place."
3026,THE CONTENTS.,Here all their starry host the heavens display;
3027,THE CONTENTS.,"And, lo! a heavenly youth, more fair than they,"
3028,THE CONTENTS.,"Leads Abram forth; points upwards; 'Such,' said he,"
3029,THE CONTENTS.,'So bright and numberless thy seed shall be.'
3030,THE CONTENTS.,"Here he with God a new alliance makes,"
3031,THE CONTENTS.,And in his flesh the marks of homage takes:
3032,THE CONTENTS.,"Here he the three mysterious persons feasts,"
3033,THE CONTENTS.,Well paid with joyful tidings by his guests:
3034,THE CONTENTS.,"Here for the wicked town he prays, and near,"
3035,THE CONTENTS.,Scarce did the wicked town through flames appear:
3036,THE CONTENTS.,"And all his fate, and all his deeds, were wrought,"
3037,THE CONTENTS.,Since he from Ur to Ephron's cave was brought.
3038,THE CONTENTS.,But none 'mongst all the forms drew then their eyes
3039,THE CONTENTS.,Like faithful Abram's righteous sacrifice:
3040,THE CONTENTS.,"The sad old man mounts slowly to the place,"
3041,THE CONTENTS.,With Nature's power triumphant in his face
3042,THE CONTENTS.,"O'er the mind's courage; for, in spite of all,"
3043,THE CONTENTS.,From his swoln eyes resistless waters fall.
3044,THE CONTENTS.,The innocent boy his cruel burden bore
3045,THE CONTENTS.,"With smiling looks, and sometimes walked before,"
3046,THE CONTENTS.,And sometimes turned to talk: above was made
3047,THE CONTENTS.,"The altar's fatal pile, and on it laid"
3048,THE CONTENTS.,"The hope of mankind: patiently he lay,"
3049,THE CONTENTS.,"And did his sire, as he his God, obey."
3050,THE CONTENTS.,"The mournful sire lifts up at last the knife,"
3051,THE CONTENTS.,"And on one moment's string depends his life,"
3052,THE CONTENTS.,In whose young loins such brooding wonders lie.
3053,THE CONTENTS.,"A thousand sp'rits peeped from the affrighted sky,"
3054,THE CONTENTS.,"Amazed at this strange scene, and almost fear'd,"
3055,THE CONTENTS.,For all those joyful prophecies they'd heard;
3056,THE CONTENTS.,"Till one leaped nimbly forth, by God's command,"
3057,THE CONTENTS.,"Like lightning from a cloud, and stopped his hand."
3058,THE CONTENTS.,The gentle sp'rit smiled kindly as he spoke;
3059,THE CONTENTS.,New beams of joy through Abram's wonder broke
3060,THE CONTENTS.,"The angel points to a tuft of bushes near,"
3061,THE CONTENTS.,"Where an entangled ram does half appear,"
3062,THE CONTENTS.,"And struggles vainly with that fatal net,"
3063,THE CONTENTS.,"Which, though but slightly wrought, was firmly set:"
3064,THE CONTENTS.,"For, lo! anon, to this sad glory doomed,"
3065,THE CONTENTS.,The useful beast on Isaac's pile consumed;
3066,THE CONTENTS.,"Whilst on his horns the ransomed couple played,"
3067,THE CONTENTS.,And the glad boy danced to the tunes he made.
3068,THE CONTENTS.,
3069,THE CONTENTS.,"Near this hall's end a shittim table stood,"
3070,THE CONTENTS.,Yet well-wrought plate strove to conceal the wood;
3071,THE CONTENTS.,"For from the foot a golden vine did sprout,"
3072,THE CONTENTS.,And cast his fruitful riches all about.
3073,THE CONTENTS.,"Well might that beauteous ore the grape express,"
3074,THE CONTENTS.,Which does weak man intoxicate no less.
3075,THE CONTENTS.,"Of the same wood the gilded beds were made,"
3076,THE CONTENTS.,"And on them large embroidered carpets laid,"
3077,THE CONTENTS.,"From Egypt, the rich shop of follies, brought;"
3078,THE CONTENTS.,But arts of pride all nations soon are taught.
3079,THE CONTENTS.,"Behold seven comely blooming youths appear,"
3080,THE CONTENTS.,"And in their hands seven silver washpots bear,"
3081,THE CONTENTS.,"Curled, and gay clad, the choicest sons that be"
3082,THE CONTENTS.,"Of Gibeon's race, and slaves of high degree."
3083,THE CONTENTS.,"Seven beauteous maids marched softly in behind,"
3084,THE CONTENTS.,"Bright scarves their clothes, their hair fresh garlands bind,"
3085,THE CONTENTS.,"And whilst the princes wash, they on them shed"
3086,THE CONTENTS.,"Rich ointments, which their costly odours spread"
3087,THE CONTENTS.,"O'er the whole room; from their small prisons free,"
3088,THE CONTENTS.,With such glad haste through the wide air they flee.
3089,THE CONTENTS.,"The King was placed alone, and o'er his head"
3090,THE CONTENTS.,"A well-wrought heaven of silk and gold was spread,"
3091,THE CONTENTS.,"Azure the ground, the sun in gold shone bright,"
3092,THE CONTENTS.,But pierced the wandering clouds with silver light.
3093,THE CONTENTS.,"The right-hand bed the King's three sons did grace,"
3094,THE CONTENTS.,"The third was Abner's, Adriel's, David's place:"
3095,THE CONTENTS.,"And twelve large tables more were filled below,"
3096,THE CONTENTS.,With the prime men Saul's court and camp could show.
3097,THE CONTENTS.,"The palace did with mirth and music sound,"
3098,THE CONTENTS.,And the crowned goblets nimbly moved around:
3099,THE CONTENTS.,"But though bright joy in every guest did shine,"
3100,THE CONTENTS.,"The plenty, state, music, and sprightful wine,"
3101,THE CONTENTS.,Were lost on Saul: an angry care did dwell
3102,THE CONTENTS.,"In his dark breast, and all gay forms expel."
3103,THE CONTENTS.,"David's unusual absence from the feast,"
3104,THE CONTENTS.,To his sick sp'rit did jealous thoughts suggest:
3105,THE CONTENTS.,"Long lay he still, nor drank, nor ate, nor spoke,"
3106,THE CONTENTS.,And thus at last his troubled silence broke.
3107,THE CONTENTS.,
3108,THE CONTENTS.,'Where can he be?' said he. 'It must be so.'
3109,THE CONTENTS.,With that he paused awhile. 'Too well we know
3110,THE CONTENTS.,"His boundless pride: he grieves, and hates to see"
3111,THE CONTENTS.,The solemn triumphs of my court and me.
3112,THE CONTENTS.,"Believe me, friends! and trust what I can show"
3113,THE CONTENTS.,From thousand proofs; the ambitious David now
3114,THE CONTENTS.,"Does those vast things in his proud soul design,"
3115,THE CONTENTS.,That too much business give for mirth or wine.
3116,THE CONTENTS.,"He's kindling now, perhaps, rebellious fire"
3117,THE CONTENTS.,"Among the tribes, and does even now conspire"
3118,THE CONTENTS.,"Against my crown, and all our lives, whilst we"
3119,THE CONTENTS.,Are loth even to suspect what we might see.
3120,THE CONTENTS.,By the Great Name 'tis true.'
3121,THE CONTENTS.,"With that he strook the board, and no man there,"
3122,THE CONTENTS.,"But Jonathan, durst undertake to clear"
3123,THE CONTENTS.,"The blameless prince: and scarce ten words he spoke,"
3124,THE CONTENTS.,When thus his speech the enraged tyrant broke:
3125,THE CONTENTS.,
3126,THE CONTENTS.,'Disloyal wretch! thy gentle mother's shame!
3127,THE CONTENTS.,"Whose cold, pale ghost even blushes at thy name!"
3128,THE CONTENTS.,"Who fears lest her chaste bed should doubted be,"
3129,THE CONTENTS.,And her white fame stained by black deeds of thee!
3130,THE CONTENTS.,Canst thou be mine? A crown sometimes does hire
3131,THE CONTENTS.,Even sons against their parents to conspire;
3132,THE CONTENTS.,"But ne'er did story yet, or fable, tell"
3133,THE CONTENTS.,"Of one so wild who, merely to rebel,"
3134,THE CONTENTS.,"Quitted the unquestioned birthright of a throne,"
3135,THE CONTENTS.,And bought his father's ruin with his own.
3136,THE CONTENTS.,Thou need'st not plead the ambitious youth's defence;
3137,THE CONTENTS.,"Thy crime clears his, and makes that innocence:"
3138,THE CONTENTS.,"Nor can his foul ingratitude appear,"
3139,THE CONTENTS.,Whilst thy unnatural guilt is placed so near.
3140,THE CONTENTS.,Is this that noble friendship you pretend?
3141,THE CONTENTS.,"Mine, thine own foe, and thy worst enemy's friend?"
3142,THE CONTENTS.,"If thy low spirit can thy great birthright quit,"
3143,THE CONTENTS.,"The thing's but just, so ill deserv'st thou it."
3144,THE CONTENTS.,"I, and thy brethren here, have no such mind,"
3145,THE CONTENTS.,"Nor such prodigious worth in David find,"
3146,THE CONTENTS.,"That we to him should our just rights resign,"
3147,THE CONTENTS.,Or think God's choice not made so well as thine.
3148,THE CONTENTS.,Shame of thy house and tribe! hence from mine eye;
3149,THE CONTENTS.,To thy false friend and servile master fly;
3150,THE CONTENTS.,He's ere this time in arms expecting thee;
3151,THE CONTENTS.,"Haste, for those arms are raised to ruin me."
3152,THE CONTENTS.,"Thy sin that way will nobler much appear,"
3153,THE CONTENTS.,Than to remain his spy and agent here.
3154,THE CONTENTS.,"When I think this, Nature, by thee forsook,"
3155,THE CONTENTS.,Forsakes me too.' With that his spear he took
3156,THE CONTENTS.,To strike at him: the mirth and music cease;
3157,THE CONTENTS.,The guests all rise this sudden storm t' appease.
3158,THE CONTENTS.,"The prince his danger and his duty knew,"
3159,THE CONTENTS.,"And low he bowed, and silently withdrew."
3160,THE CONTENTS.,
3161,THE CONTENTS.,"To David straight, who in a forest nigh"
3162,THE CONTENTS.,"Waits his advice, the royal friend does fly."
3163,THE CONTENTS.,"The sole advice, now, like the danger clear,"
3164,THE CONTENTS.,Was in some foreign land this storm t' outwear.
3165,THE CONTENTS.,"All marks of comely grief in both are seen,"
3166,THE CONTENTS.,And mournful kind discourses passed between.
3167,THE CONTENTS.,Now generous tears their hasty tongues restrain;
3168,THE CONTENTS.,"Now they begin, and talk all o'er again:"
3169,THE CONTENTS.,"A reverent oath of constant love they take,"
3170,THE CONTENTS.,And God's high name their dreaded witness make:
3171,THE CONTENTS.,"Not that at all their faiths could doubtful prove,"
3172,THE CONTENTS.,But 'twas the tedious zeal of endless love.
3173,THE CONTENTS.,"Thus, ere they part, they the short time bestow"
3174,THE CONTENTS.,In all the pomp friendship and grief could show.
3175,THE CONTENTS.,"And David now, with doubtful cares oppressed,"
3176,THE CONTENTS.,Beneath a shade borrows some little rest;
3177,THE CONTENTS.,"When by command divine thick mists arise,"
3178,THE CONTENTS.,"And stop the sense, and close the conquered eyes."
3179,THE CONTENTS.,"There is a place which man most high doth rear,"
3180,THE CONTENTS.,"The small world's heaven, where reason moves the sphere;"
3181,THE CONTENTS.,"Here in a robe which does all colours show,"
3182,THE CONTENTS.,"(The envy of birds, and the clouds' gaudy bow,)"
3183,THE CONTENTS.,"Fancy, wild dame, with much lascivious pride,"
3184,THE CONTENTS.,"By twin-chameleons drawn, does gaily ride:"
3185,THE CONTENTS.,"Her coach there follows, and throngs round about"
3186,THE CONTENTS.,Of shapes and airy forms an endless rout.
3187,THE CONTENTS.,A sea rolls on with harmless fury here;
3188,THE CONTENTS.,"Straight 'tis a field, and trees and herbs appear."
3189,THE CONTENTS.,"Here in a moment are vast armies made,"
3190,THE CONTENTS.,And a quick scene of war and blood displayed.
3191,THE CONTENTS.,"Here sparkling wines, and brighter maids come in,"
3192,THE CONTENTS.,"The bawds for Sense, and lying baits of sin."
3193,THE CONTENTS.,"Some things arise of strange and quarrelling kind,"
3194,THE CONTENTS.,"The forepart lion, and a snake behind."
3195,THE CONTENTS.,"Here golden mountains swell the covetous place,"
3196,THE CONTENTS.,"And Centaurs ride themselves, a painted race."
3197,THE CONTENTS.,"Of these slight wonders Nature sees the store,"
3198,THE CONTENTS.,And only then accounts herself but poor.
3199,THE CONTENTS.,"Hither an angel comes in David's trance,"
3200,THE CONTENTS.,And finds them mingled in an antique dance;
3201,THE CONTENTS.,"Of all the numerous forms fit choice he takes,"
3202,THE CONTENTS.,"And joins them wisely, and this vision makes."
3203,THE CONTENTS.,
3204,THE CONTENTS.,"First, David there appears in kingly state,"
3205,THE CONTENTS.,Whilst the Twelve Tribes his dread commands await:
3206,THE CONTENTS.,"Straight to the wars with his joined strength he goes,"
3207,THE CONTENTS.,"Settles new friends, and frights his ancient foes."
3208,THE CONTENTS.,"To Solima, Canaan's old head, they came,"
3209,THE CONTENTS.,"(Since high in note, then not unknown to Fame,)"
3210,THE CONTENTS.,"The blind and lame the undoubted wall defend,"
3211,THE CONTENTS.,And no new wounds or dangers apprehend.
3212,THE CONTENTS.,The busy image of great Joab there
3213,THE CONTENTS.,"Disdains the mock, and teaches them to fear:"
3214,THE CONTENTS.,"He climbs the airy walls, leaps raging down,"
3215,THE CONTENTS.,New-minted shapes of slaughter fill the town.
3216,THE CONTENTS.,"They curse the guards their mirth and bravery chose,"
3217,THE CONTENTS.,"All of them now are slain, or made like those."
3218,THE CONTENTS.,"Far through an inward scene an army lay,"
3219,THE CONTENTS.,Which with full banners a fair Fish display.
3220,THE CONTENTS.,From Sidon plains to happy Egypt's coast
3221,THE CONTENTS.,"They seem all met, a vast and warlike host."
3222,THE CONTENTS.,"Thither hastes David to his destined prey,"
3223,THE CONTENTS.,Honour and noble danger lead the way.
3224,THE CONTENTS.,The conscious trees shook with a reverent fear
3225,THE CONTENTS.,Their unblown tops: God walked before him there.
3226,THE CONTENTS.,"Slaughter the wearied Rephaims' bosom fills,"
3227,THE CONTENTS.,Dead corpse emboss the vale with little hills.
3228,THE CONTENTS.,"On the other side, Sophenes' mighty king"
3229,THE CONTENTS.,Numberless troops of the bless'd East does bring:
3230,THE CONTENTS.,"Twice are his men cut off, and chariots ta'en;"
3231,THE CONTENTS.,Damascus and rich Adad help in vain;
3232,THE CONTENTS.,"Here Nabathaean troops in battle stand,"
3233,THE CONTENTS.,With all the lusty youth of Syrian land;
3234,THE CONTENTS.,"Undaunted Joab rushes on with speed,"
3235,THE CONTENTS.,Gallantly mounted on his fiery steed;
3236,THE CONTENTS.,"He hews down all, and deals his deaths around;"
3237,THE CONTENTS.,"The Syrians leave, or possess, dead, the ground."
3238,THE CONTENTS.,"On the other wing does brave Abishai ride,"
3239,THE CONTENTS.,Reeking in blood and dust: on every side
3240,THE CONTENTS.,The perjured sons of Ammon quit the field;
3241,THE CONTENTS.,"Some basely die, and some more basely yield."
3242,THE CONTENTS.,"Through a thick wood the wretched Hanun flies,"
3243,THE CONTENTS.,And far more justly then fears Hebrew spies.
3244,THE CONTENTS.,"Moloch, their bloody god, thrusts out his head,"
3245,THE CONTENTS.,Grinning through a black cloud: him they'd long fed
3246,THE CONTENTS.,"In his seven chambers, and he still did eat"
3247,THE CONTENTS.,"New-roasted babes, his dear delicious meat."
3248,THE CONTENTS.,"Again they rise, more angered and dismayed;"
3249,THE CONTENTS.,Euphrates and swift Tigris sends them aid:
3250,THE CONTENTS.,"In vain they send it, for again they're slain,"
3251,THE CONTENTS.,And feast the greedy birds on Healy plain.
3252,THE CONTENTS.,"Here Rabba with proud towers affronts the sky,"
3253,THE CONTENTS.,And round about great Joab's trenches lie:
3254,THE CONTENTS.,"They force the walls, and sack the helpless town;"
3255,THE CONTENTS.,On David's head shines Ammon's massy crown.
3256,THE CONTENTS.,'Midst various torments the cursed race expires;
3257,THE CONTENTS.,David himself his severe wrath admires.
3258,THE CONTENTS.,
3259,THE CONTENTS.,Next upon Israel's throne does bravely sit
3260,THE CONTENTS.,"A comely youth, endowed with wondrous wit:"
3261,THE CONTENTS.,"Far, from the parched line, a royal dame,"
3262,THE CONTENTS.,"To hear his tongue and boundless wisdom, came:"
3263,THE CONTENTS.,She carried back in her triumphant womb
3264,THE CONTENTS.,The glorious stock of thousand kings to come.
3265,THE CONTENTS.,Here brightest forms his pomp and wealth display;
3266,THE CONTENTS.,Here they a temple's vast foundations lay;
3267,THE CONTENTS.,"A mighty work; and with fit glories filled,"
3268,THE CONTENTS.,"For God to inhabit, and that King to build."
3269,THE CONTENTS.,"Some from the quarries hew out massy stone,"
3270,THE CONTENTS.,Some draw it up with cranes; some breathe and groan
3271,THE CONTENTS.,In order o'er the anvil; some cut down
3272,THE CONTENTS.,"Tall cedars, the proud mountain's ancient crown;"
3273,THE CONTENTS.,"Some carve the trunks, and breathing shapes bestow,"
3274,THE CONTENTS.,Giving the trees more life than when they grow.
3275,THE CONTENTS.,"But, oh! alas! what sudden cloud is spread"
3276,THE CONTENTS.,About this glorious King's eclipsed head?
3277,THE CONTENTS.,"It all his fame benights, and all his store,"
3278,THE CONTENTS.,Wrapping him round; and now he's seen no more.
3279,THE CONTENTS.,
3280,THE CONTENTS.,"When straight his son appears at Sichem crown'd,"
3281,THE CONTENTS.,With young and heedless council circled round;
3282,THE CONTENTS.,Unseemly object! but a falling state
3283,THE CONTENTS.,Has always its own errors joined with Fate.
3284,THE CONTENTS.,"Ten tribes at once forsake the Jessian throne,"
3285,THE CONTENTS.,And bold Adoram at his message stone;
3286,THE CONTENTS.,"'Brethren of Israel!'--More he fain would say,"
3287,THE CONTENTS.,"But a flint stopped his mouth, and speech in the way."
3288,THE CONTENTS.,Here this fond king's disasters but begin;
3289,THE CONTENTS.,He's destined to more shame by his father's sin.
3290,THE CONTENTS.,"Susac comes up, and under his command"
3291,THE CONTENTS.,"A dreadful army from scorched Afric's sand,"
3292,THE CONTENTS.,As numberless as that: all is his prey;
3293,THE CONTENTS.,The temple's sacred wealth they bear away;
3294,THE CONTENTS.,Adrazar's shields and golden loss they take;
3295,THE CONTENTS.,Even David in his dream does sweat and shake.
3296,THE CONTENTS.,Thus fails this wretched prince; his loins appear
3297,THE CONTENTS.,Of less weight now than Solomon's fingers were.
3298,THE CONTENTS.,

3562,THE CONTENTS.,Where the most sprightly azure please the eyes;

3570,THE CONTENTS.,Caught gliding o'er pure streams on which he plays.
3571,THE CONTENTS.,
3572,THE CONTENTS.,"Thus dressed, the joyful Gabriel posts away,"
3573,THE CONTENTS.,And carries with him his own glorious day
3574,THE CONTENTS.,Through the thick woods; the gloomy shades a while
3575,THE CONTENTS.,"Put on fresh, looks, and wonder why they smile;"
3576,THE CONTENTS.,The trembling serpents close and silent lie;
3577,THE CONTENTS.,The birds obscene far from his passage fly;
3578,THE CONTENTS.,"A sudden spring waits on him as he goes,"
3579,THE CONTENTS.,Sudden as that which by creation rose.
3580,THE CONTENTS.,Thus he appears to David; at first sight

3703,III.,"With half a smile and half a frown,"
3704,III.,'But what God can to Egypt be unknown?
3705,III.,"What sign, what powers, what credence do you bring?'"
3706,III.,'Behold his seal! behold his hand!'
3707,III.,"Cries Moses, and casts down the almighty wand:"
3708,III.,"The almighty wand scarce touched the earth,"
3709,III.,"When, with an undiscerned birth,"
3710,III.,"The almighty wand a serpent grew,"
3711,III.,And his long half in painted folds behind him drew:
3712,III.,"Upwards his threatening tail he threw,"
3713,III.,"Upwards he cast his threatening head,"
3714,III.,"He gaped and hissed aloud,"
3715,III.,"With flaming eyes surveyed the trembling crowd,"
3716,III.,"And, like a basilisk, almost looked the assembly dead:"
3717,III.,"Swift fled the amazed king, the guards before him fled."
3718,III.,
3719,IV.,IV.
3720,IV.,
3721,IV.,"Jannes and Jambres stopped their flight,"
3722,IV.,And with proud words allayed the affright.
3723,IV.,"'The God of slaves!' said they, 'how can he be"
3724,IV.,More powerful than their master's deity?'
3725,IV.,"And down they cast their rods,"
3726,IV.,"And muttered secret sounds that charm the servile gods,"
3727,IV.,"The evil spirits their charms obey,"
3728,IV.,"And in a subtle cloud they snatch the rods away,"
3729,IV.,And serpents in their place the airy jugglers lay:
3730,IV.,Serpents in Egypt's monstrous land
3731,IV.,"Were ready still at hand,"
3732,IV.,And all at the Old Serpent's first command:
3733,IV.,"And they, too, gaped, and they, too, hissed,"
3734,IV.,And they their threatening tails did twist;
3735,IV.,"But straight on both the Hebrew serpent flew,"
3736,IV.,"Broke both their active backs, and both it slew,"
3737,IV.,And both almost at once devoured;
3738,IV.,So much was overpowered
3739,IV.,By God's miraculous creation
3740,IV.,His servant Nature's slightly wrought and feeble generation.
3741,IV.,
3742,V.,V.
3743,V.,
3744,V.,"On the famed bank the prophets stood,"
3745,V.,"Touched with their rod, and wounded all the flood;"
3746,V.,"Flood now no more, but a long vein of putrid blood;"
3747,V.,The helpless fish were found
3748,V.,In their strange current drowned;
3749,V.,The herbs and trees washed by the mortal tide
3750,V.,About it blushed and died:
3751,V.,The amazed crocodiles made haste to ground;
3752,V.,"From their vast trunks the dropping gore they spied,"
3753,V.,"Thought it their own, and dreadfully aloud they cried:"
3754,V.,"Nor all thy priests, nor thou,"
3755,V.,O King! couldst ever show
3756,V.,From whence thy wandering Nile begins his course;
3757,V.,"Of this new Nile thou seest the sacred source,"
3758,V.,"And as thy land that does o'erflow,"
3759,V.,Take heed lest this do so.
3760,V.,What plague more just could on thy waters fall?
3761,V.,The Hebrew infants' murder stains them all.
3762,V.,"The kind, instructing punishment enjoy;"
3763,V.,"Whom the red river cannot mend, the Red Sea shall destroy."
3764,V.,
3765,VI.,VI.
3766,VI.,
3767,VI.,"The river yet gave one instruction more,"
3768,VI.,"And from the rotting fish and unconcocted gore,"
3769,VI.,"Which was but water just before,"
3770,VI.,"A loathsome host was quickly made,"
3771,VI.,"That scaled the banks, and with loud noise did all the country invade;"
3772,VI.,"As Nilus when he quits his sacred bed,"
3773,VI.,(But like a friend he visits all the land
3774,VI.,"With welcome presents in his hand,)"
3775,VI.,So did this living tide the fields o'erspread.
3776,VI.,In vain the alarmed country tries
3777,VI.,"To kill their noisome enemies,"
3778,VI.,From the unexhausted source still new recruits arise:
3779,VI.,Nor does the earth these greedy troops suffice;
3780,VI.,"The towns and houses they possess,"
3781,VI.,"The temples and the palaces,"
3782,VI.,"Nor Pharaoh nor his gods they fear,"
3783,VI.,Both their importune croakings hear:
3784,VI.,"Unsatiate yet they mount up higher,"
3785,VI.,"Where never sun-born frog durst to aspire,"
3786,VI.,"And in the silken beds their slimy members place,"
3787,VI.,A luxury unknown before to all the watery race.
3788,VI.,
3789,VII.,VII.
3790,VII.,
3791,VII.,"The water thus her wonders did produce,"
3792,VII.,But both were to no use:
3793,VII.,As yet the sorcerer's mimic power served for excuse.
3794,VII.,"Try what the earth will do, said God, and lo!"
3795,VII.,"They struck the earth a fertile blow,"
3796,VII.,"And all the dust did straight to stir begin,"
3797,VII.,"One would have thought some sudden wind had been,"
3798,VII.,"But, lo! 'twas nimble life was got within!"
3799,VII.,"And all the little springs did move,"
3800,VII.,"And every dust did an armed vermin prove,"
3801,VII.,"Of an unknown and new-created kind,"
3802,VII.,Such as the magic gods could neither make or find.
3803,VII.,The wretched shameful foe allowed no rest
3804,VII.,Either to man or beast;
3805,VII.,"Not Pharaoh from the unquiet plague could be,"
3806,VII.,"With all his change of raiments, free;"
3807,VII.,The devils themselves confessed
3808,VII.,This was God's hand; and 'twas but just

3811,VIII.,VIII.
3812,VIII.,
3813,VIII.,"Lo! the third element does his plagues prepare,"

3816,VIII.,And march in bodies infinite;
3817,VIII.,"In vain 'tis day above, 'tis still beneath them night;"
3818,VIII.,Of harmful flies the nations numberless
3819,VIII.,Composed this mighty army's spacious boast;
3820,VIII.,"Of different manners, different languages,"
3821,VIII.,"And different habits, too, they wore,"
3822,VIII.,And different arms they bore:
3823,VIII.,"And some, like Scythians, lived on blood,"
3824,VIII.,"And some on green, and some on flowery food,"
3825,VIII.,"And Accaron, the airy prince, led on this various host."
3826,VIII.,Houses secure not men; the populous ill
3827,VIII.,Did all the houses fill:
3828,VIII.,"The country all around,"
3829,VIII.,Did with the cries of tortured cattle sound;
3830,VIII.,"About the fields enraged they flew,"
3831,VIII.,And wished the plague that was t' ensue.

3838,IX.,"And with just hands the sad composure make,"
3839,IX.,And over all the land did the full viol shake.
3840,IX.,"Thirst, giddiness, faintness, and putrid heats,"
3841,IX.,"And pining pains, and shivering sweats,"
3842,IX.,"On all the cattle, all the beasts, did fall;"
3843,IX.,With deformed death the country's covered all.
3844,IX.,The labouring ox drops down before the plough;
3845,IX.,The crowned victims to the altar led
3846,IX.,"Sink, and prevent the lifted blow:"
3847,IX.,"The generous horse from the full manger turns his head,"
3848,IX.,"Does his loved floods and pastures scorn,"
3849,IX.,"Hates the shrill trumpet and the horn,"
3850,IX.,Nor can his lifeless nostril please
3851,IX.,With the once-ravishing smell of all his dappled mistresses;
3852,IX.,"The starving sheep refuse to feed,"
3853,IX.,They bleat their innocent souls out into air;
3854,IX.,The faithful dogs lie gasping by them there;

3857,X.,X.
3858,X.,
3859,X.,Thus did the beasts for man's rebellion die;
3860,X.,"God did on man a gentler medicine try,"
3861,X.,And a disease for physic did apply.
3862,X.,"Warm ashes from the furnace Moses took,"
3863,X.,"The sorcerers did with wonder on him look,"
3864,X.,And smiled at the unaccustomed spell
3865,X.,Which no Egyptian rituals tell.
3866,X.,"He flings the pregnant ashes through the air,"
3867,X.,"And speaks a mighty prayer,"
3868,X.,Both which the minist'ring winds around all Egypt bear;
3869,X.,"As gentle western blasts, with downy wings"
3870,X.,"Hatching the tender springs,"
3871,X.,"To the unborn buds with vital whispers say,"
3872,X.,"Ye living buds, why do ye stay?"
3873,X.,The passionate buds break through the bark their way;
3874,X.,"So wheresoe'er this tainted wind but blew,"
3875,X.,Swelling pains and ulcers grew;
3876,X.,"It from the body called all sleeping poisons out,"
3877,X.,And to them added new;
3878,X.,A noisome spring of sores as thick as leaves did sprout.
3879,X.,
3880,XI.,XI.
3881,XI.,
3882,XI.,Heaven itself is angry next;
3883,XI.,Woe to man when Heaven is vexed;
3884,XI.,"With sullen brow it frowned,"
3885,XI.,And murmured first in an imperfect sound;
3886,XI.,"Till Moses, lifting up his hand,"
3887,XI.,"Waves the expected signal of his wand,"
3888,XI.,"And all the full-charged clouds in ranged squadrons move,"
3889,XI.,And fill the spacious plains above;
3890,XI.,"Through which the rolling thunder first does play,"
3891,XI.,And opens wide the tempest's noisy way:
3892,XI.,And straight a stony shower
3893,XI.,"Of monstrous hail does downward pour,"
3894,XI.,"Such as ne'er Winter yet brought forth,"
3895,XI.,From all her stormy magazines of the north:
3896,XI.,"It all the beasts and men abroad did slay,"
3897,XI.,"O'er the defaced corpse, like monuments, lay;"
3898,XI.,"The houses and strong-bodied trees it broke,"
3899,XI.,Nor asked aid from the thunder's stroke:
3900,XI.,"The thunder but for terror through it flew,"
3901,XI.,The hail alone the work could do.
3902,XI.,"The dismal lightnings all around,"
3903,XI.,"Some flying through the air, some running on the ground,"
3904,XI.,"Some swimming o'er the waters' face,"
3905,XI.,Filled with bright horror every place;
3906,XI.,"One would have thought, their dreadful day to have seen,"
3907,XI.,The very hail and rain itself had kindled been.
3908,XI.,
3909,XII.,XII.
3910,XII.,
3911,XII.,"The infant corn, which yet did scarce appear,"
3912,XII.,Escaped this general massacre
3913,XII.,"Of every thing that grew,"
3914,XII.,And the well-stored Egyptian year
3915,XII.,Began to clothe her fields and trees anew;
3916,XII.,"When, lo! a scorching wind from the burnt countries blew,"
3917,XII.,And endless legions with it drew
3918,XII.,"Of greedy locusts, who, where'er"
3919,XII.,"With sounding wings they flew,"
3920,XII.,"Left all the earth depopulate and bare,"
3921,XII.,"As if Winter itself had marched by there,"
3922,XII.,Whate'er the sun and Nile
3923,XII.,"Gave with large bounty to the thankful soil,"
3924,XII.,"The wretched pillagers bore away,"
3925,XII.,And the whole Summer was their prey;
3926,XII.,"Till Moses with a prayer,"
3927,XII.,"Breathed forth a violent western wind,"
3928,XII.,Which all these living clouds did headlong bear
3929,XII.,(No stragglers left behind)
3930,XII.,"Into the purple sea, and there bestow"
3931,XII.,On the luxurious fish a feast they ne'er did know.
3932,XII.,"With untaught joy Pharaoh the news does hear,"
3933,XII.,And little thinks their fate attends on him and his so near.

3936,XIII.,
3937,XIII.,What blindness and what darkness did there e'er
3938,XIII.,Like this undocile king's appear?
3939,XIII.,Whate'er but that which now does represent
3940,XIII.,And paint the crime out in the punishment?
3941,XIII.,"From the deep baleful caves of hell below,"
3942,XIII.,"Where the old mother Night does grow,"
3943,XIII.,"Substantial Night, that does disclaim"
3944,XIII.,"Privation's empty name,"
3945,XIII.,"Through secret conduits monstrous shapes arose,"
3946,XIII.,Such as the sun's whole force could not oppose;
3947,XIII.,They with a solid cloud
3948,XIII.,All heaven's eclipsed face did shroud;
3949,XIII.,"Seemed with large wings spread o'er the sea and earth,"
3950,XIII.,To brood up a new Chaos his deformed birth;
3951,XIII.,"And every lamp, and every fire,"
3952,XIII.,"Did, at the dreadful sight, wink and expire,"
3953,XIII.,To the empyrean source all streams of light seemed to retire.
3954,XIII.,"The living men were in their standing houses buried,"
3955,XIII.,"But the long night no slumber knows,"
3956,XIII.,But the short death finds no repose.
3957,XIII.,"Ten thousand terrors through the darkness fled,"
3958,XIII.,"And ghosts complained, and spirits murmured,"
3959,XIII.,And fancy's multiplying sight
3960,XIII.,Viewed all the scenes invisible of night.
3961,XIII.,
3962,XIV.,XIV.
3963,XIV.,
3964,XIV.,Of God's dreadful anger these
3965,XIV.,Were but the first light skirmishes;
3966,XIV.,"The shock and bloody battle now begins,"
3967,XIV.,The plenteous harvest of full-ripened sins.
3968,XIV.,It was the time when the still moon
3969,XIV.,"Was mounted softly to her noon,"
3970,XIV.,"And dewy sleep, which from Night's secret springs arose,"
3971,XIV.,Gently as Nile the land o'erflows;
3972,XIV.,"When, lo! from the high countries of refined day,"
3973,XIV.,"The golden heaven without allay,"
3974,XIV.,"Whose dross, in the creation purged away,"
3975,XIV.,"Made up the sun's adulterate ray,"
3976,XIV.,"Michael, the warlike prince, does downwards fly,"
3977,XIV.,"Swift as the journeys of the sight,"
3978,XIV.,"Swift as the race of light,"
3979,XIV.,And with his winged will cuts through the yielding sky.
3980,XIV.,"He passed through many a star, and as he passed"
3981,XIV.,Shone (like a star in them) more brightly there
3982,XIV.,Than they did in their sphere:
3983,XIV.,"On a tall pyramid's pointed head he stopped at last,"
3984,XIV.,And a mild look of sacred pity cast
3985,XIV.,Down on the sinful land where he was sent
3986,XIV.,To inflict the tardy punishment.
3987,XIV.,"'Ah! yet,' said he, 'yet, stubborn King! repent,"
3988,XIV.,"Whilst thus unarmed I stand,"
3989,XIV.,Ere the keen sword of God fill my commanded hand;

3991,XIV.,"Who would, alas! believe"
3992,XIV.,"That it for man,' said he,"

3994,XIV.,And yet for God so easy to forgive!'
3995,XIV.,
3996,XV.,XV.
3997,XV.,
3998,XV.,"He spoke, and downwards flew,"
3999,XV.,"And o'er his shining form a well-cut cloud he threw,"
4000,XV.,"Made of the blackest fleece of night,"
4001,XV.,And close-wrought to keep in the powerful light;
4002,XV.,"Yet, wrought so fine, it hindered not his flight,"
4003,XV.,"But through the key-holes and the chinks of doors,"
4004,XV.,"And through the narrowest walks of crooked pores,"
4005,XV.,He passed more swift and free
4006,XV.,Than in wide air the wanton swallows flee:
4007,XV.,"He took a pointed pestilence in his hand,"
4008,XV.,The spirits of thousand mortal poisons made
4009,XV.,"The strongly-tempered blade,"
4010,XV.,The sharpest sword that e'er was laid
4011,XV.,Up in the magazines of God to scourge a wicked land:
4012,XV.,"Through Egypt's wicked land his march he took,"
4013,XV.,And as he marched the sacred first-born struck
4014,XV.,Of every womb; none did he spare;
4015,XV.,None from the meanest beast to Cenchre's purple heir.

4019,XVI.,The swift approach of endless night
4020,XVI.,Breaks ope the wounded sleepers' rolling eyes;
4021,XVI.,"They awake the rest with dying cries,"
4022,XVI.,And darkness doubles the affright.
4023,XVI.,"The mixed sounds of scattered deaths they hear,"
4024,XVI.,And lose their parted souls 'twixt grief and fear.
4025,XVI.,"Louder than all, the shrieking women's voice"
4026,XVI.,Pierces this chaos of confused noise;
4027,XVI.,"As brighter lightning cuts a way,"
4028,XVI.,Clear and distinguished through the day:
4029,XVI.,With less complaints the Zoan temples sound
4030,XVI.,"When the adored heifer's drowned,"
4031,XVI.,And no true marked successor to be found:
4032,XVI.,"While health, and strength, and gladness does possess"
4033,XVI.,The festal Hebrew cottages;
4034,XVI.,"The bless'd destroyer comes not there,"
4035,XVI.,"To interrupt the sacred cheer,"
4036,XVI.,That new begins their well-reformed year.
4037,XVI.,Upon their doors he read and understood
4038,XVI.,God's protection writ in blood;
4039,XVI.,"Well was he skilled i' th' character divine,"
4040,XVI.,"And though he passed by it in haste,"
4041,XVI.,"He bowed, and worshipped as he passed"

4049,XVII.,"To haste the Hebrews now away,"
4050,XVII.,Pharaoh himself chides their delay;
4051,XVII.,So kind and bountiful is fear!
4052,XVII.,"But, oh! the bounty which to fear we owe,"
4053,XVII.,"Is but like fire struck out of stone,"
4054,XVII.,"So hardly got, and quickly gone,"
4055,XVII.,That it scarce outlives the blow.
4056,XVII.,"Sorrow and fear soon quit the tyrant's breast,"
4057,XVII.,Rage and revenge their place possess'd:
4058,XVII.,"With a vast host of chariots and of horse,"
4059,XVII.,"And all his powerful kingdom's ready force,"
4060,XVII.,"The travelling nation he pursues,"
4061,XVII.,"Ten times o'ercome, he still the unequal war renews."
4062,XVII.,"Filled with proud hopes, 'At least,' said he,"
4063,XVII.,"'The Egyptian gods, from Syrian magic free,"
4064,XVII.,Will now revenge themselves and me;
4065,XVII.,"Behold what passless rocks on either hand,"
4066,XVII.,"Like prison walls, about them stand!"
4067,XVII.,"Whilst the sea bounds their flight before,"
4068,XVII.,And in our injured justice they must find
4069,XVII.,A far worse stop than rocks and seas behind;
4070,XVII.,Which shall with crimson gore

4072,XVII.,
4073,XVIII.,XVIII.

4075,XVIII.,He spoke; and all his host
4076,XVIII.,Approved with shouts the unhappy boast;
4077,XVIII.,"A bidden wind bore his vain words away,"
4078,XVIII.,And drowned them in the neighbouring sea.
4079,XVIII.,"No means to escape the faithless travellers spy,"
4080,XVIII.,"And with degenerous fear to die,"
4081,XVIII.,Curse their new-gotten liberty:
4082,XVIII.,"But the great Guide well knew he led them right,"
4083,XVIII.,And saw a path hid yet from human sight:
4084,XVIII.,He strikes the raging waves; the waves on either side
4085,XVIII.,"Unloose their close embraces, and divide,"
4086,XVIII.,"And backwards press, as in some solemn show"
4087,XVIII.,"The crowding people do,"
4088,XVIII.,"(Though just before no space was seen,)"
4089,XVIII.,To let the admired triumph pass between.
4090,XVIII.,"The wondering army saw, on either hand,"
4091,XVIII.,The no less wondering waves like rocks of crystal stand.
4092,XVIII.,"They marched betwixt, and boldly trod"

4094,XVIII.,"And here and there, all scattered in their way,"
4095,XVIII.,The sea's old spoils and gaping fishes lay
4096,XVIII.,Deserted on the sandy plain:
4097,XVIII.,The sun did with astonishment behold
4098,XVIII.,"The inmost chambers of the opened main,"
4099,XVIII.,For whatsoe'er of old

4104,XIX.,
4105,XIX.,"Led cheerfully by a bright captain, Flame,"
4106,XIX.,"To the other shore at morning-dawn they came,"
4107,XIX.,And saw behind the unguided foe
4108,XIX.,March disorderly and slow:
4109,XIX.,The prophet straight from the Idumean strand
4110,XIX.,Shakes his imperious wand;
4111,XIX.,"The upper waves, that highest crowded lie,"
4112,XIX.,The beckoning wand espy;
4113,XIX.,"Straight their first right-hand files begin to move,"
4114,XIX.,And with a murmuring wind
4115,XIX.,Give the word march to all behind;
4116,XIX.,"The left-hand squadrons no less ready prove,"
4117,XIX.,"But with a joyful, louder noise,"
4118,XIX.,"Answer their distant fellows' voice,"
4119,XIX.,"And haste to meet them make,"
4120,XIX.,As several troops do all at once a common signal take.
4121,XIX.,"What tongue the amazement and the affright can tell,"
4122,XIX.,"Which on the Chamian army fell,"
4123,XIX.,When on both sides they saw the roaring main
4124,XIX.,Broke loose from his invisible chain?
4125,XIX.,They saw the monstrous death and watery war
4126,XIX.,Come rolling down loud ruin from afar;
4127,XIX.,In vain some backward and some forwards fly

4130,XIX.,"In vain their guilty king they upbraid,"
4131,XIX.,"In vain on Moses he, and Moses' God, does call,"

4149,GEORGE WITHER,"indispensable, and determined not to flatter, he, in 1613, published his"
4150,GEORGE WITHER,"'Abuses Whipt and Stript,' for which he was committed for some months"
4151,GEORGE WITHER,"to the Marshalsea. Here he wrote his beautiful poem, 'The Shepherd's"
4152,GEORGE WITHER,Hunting;' and is said to have gained his manumission by a satire to
4153,GEORGE WITHER,"the King, in which he defends his former writings. Soon after his"
4154,GEORGE WITHER,"liberation, he published his 'Hymns and Songs of the Church,' a book"
4155,GEORGE WITHER,"which embroiled him with the clergy, but procured him the favour of King"
4156,GEORGE WITHER,"James, who encouraged him to finish a translation of the Psalms. He"
4157,GEORGE WITHER,"travelled to the court of the Queen of Bohemia, (James's daughter,) in"
4158,GEORGE WITHER,"fulfilment of a vow, and presented her with a copy of his completed"
4159,GEORGE WITHER,translation.
4160,GEORGE WITHER,
4161,GEORGE WITHER,"In 1639, he was a captain of horse in the expedition against the Scotch."
4162,GEORGE WITHER,"When the Civil War broke out, he sold his estate to raise a troop of"
4163,GEORGE WITHER,"horse on the Parliamentary side, and soon after was made a major. In"
4164,GEORGE WITHER,"1642, he was appointed captain and commander of Farnham Castle, in"
4165,GEORGE WITHER,"Surrey; but owing to some neglect or cowardice on his part, it was ceded"
4166,GEORGE WITHER,the same year to Sir William Waller. He was made prisoner by the
4167,GEORGE WITHER,"Royalists some time after this, and would have been put to death had not"
4168,GEORGE WITHER,"Denham interfered, alleging that as long as Wither survived, he (Denham)"
4169,GEORGE WITHER,could not be accounted the worst poet in England. He was afterwards
4170,GEORGE WITHER,appointed Cromwell's major-general of all the horse and foot in the
4171,GEORGE WITHER,"county of Surrey. He made money at this time by Royalist sequestrations,"
4172,GEORGE WITHER,"but lost it all at the Restoration. He had, on the death of Cromwell,"
4173,GEORGE WITHER,"hailed Richard with enthusiasm, and predicted him a happy reign; which"
4174,GEORGE WITHER,"makes Campbell remark, 'He never but once in his life foreboded good,"
4175,GEORGE WITHER,and in that prophecy he was mistaken.' Wither was by no means pleased
4176,GEORGE WITHER,"with the loss of his fortune, and remonstrated bitterly; but for so"
4177,GEORGE WITHER,doing he was thrown into prison again. Here his mind continued as active
4178,GEORGE WITHER,"as ever, and he poured out treatises, poems, and satires--sometimes,"
4179,GEORGE WITHER,"when pen and ink were denied him, inscribing his thoughts with red ochre"
4180,GEORGE WITHER,"upon a trencher. After three years, he was, in 1663, released from"
4181,GEORGE WITHER,"Newgate, under bond for good behaviour; and four years afterwards he"
4182,GEORGE WITHER,died in London. This was on the 2d of May 1667. He was buried between
4183,GEORGE WITHER,"the east door and the south end of the Savoy church, in the Strand."
4184,GEORGE WITHER,
4185,GEORGE WITHER,"Wither was a man of real genius, but seems to have been partially"
4186,GEORGE WITHER,insane. His political zeal was a frenzy; and his religion was deeply
4187,GEORGE WITHER,tinged with puritanic gloom. His 'Collection of Emblems' never became so
4188,GEORGE WITHER,"popular as those of Quarles, and are now nearly as much forgotten as his"
4189,GEORGE WITHER,"satires, his psalms, and his controversial treatises. But his early"
4190,GEORGE WITHER,"poems are delightful--full of elegant and playful fancy, ease of"
4191,GEORGE WITHER,"language, and delicacy of sentiment. Some passages in 'The Shepherd's"
4192,GEORGE WITHER,"Hunting,' and in the 'Address to Poetry,' resemble the style of Milton"
4193,GEORGE WITHER,in his 'L'Allegro' and 'Penseroso.' His 'Christmas' catches the full
4194,GEORGE WITHER,"spirit of that joyous carnival of Christian England. Altogether, it is"
4195,GEORGE WITHER,refreshing to turn from the gnarled oak of Wither's struggling and
4196,GEORGE WITHER,"unhappy life, to the beautiful flowers, nodding over it, of his poesy."

4483,CUDDY.,"Yea, many that did never see thee too."
4484,CUDDY.,"Some deem thee in a fault, and most in none;"
4485,CUDDY.,So divers ways do divers rumours go:
4486,CUDDY.,"And at all meetings where our shepherds be,"
4487,CUDDY.,Now the main news that's extant is of thee.
4488,CUDDY.,
4489,ROGET.,ROGET.
4490,ROGET.,
4491,ROGET.,"Why, this is somewhat yet: had I but kept"
4492,ROGET.,"Sheep on the mountains till the day of doom,"
4493,ROGET.,"My name should in obscurity have slept,"
4494,ROGET.,"In brakes, in briars, shrubbed furze and broom."
4495,ROGET.,"Into the world's wide care it had not crept,"
4496,ROGET.,Nor in so many men's thoughts found a room:
4497,ROGET.,But what cause of my sufferings do they know?
4498,ROGET.,"Good Cuddy, tell me how doth rumour go?"
4499,ROGET.,
4500,CUDDY.,CUDDY.
4501,CUDDY.,
4502,CUDDY.,"Faith, 'tis uncertain; some speak this, some that:"
4503,CUDDY.,"Some dare say nought, yet seem to think a cause,"
4504,CUDDY.,"And many a one, prating he knows not what,"
4505,CUDDY.,"Comes out with proverbs and old ancient saws,"
4506,CUDDY.,"As if he thought thee guiltless, and yet not:"
4507,CUDDY.,"Then doth he speak half-sentences, then pause:"
4508,CUDDY.,"That what the most would say, we may suppose:"
4509,CUDDY.,"But what to say, the rumour is, none knows."
4510,CUDDY.,
4511,ROGET.,ROGET.
4512,ROGET.,
4513,ROGET.,"Nor care I greatly, for it skills not much"
4514,ROGET.,What the unsteady common-people deems;
4515,ROGET.,"His conscience doth not always feel least touch,"
4516,ROGET.,That blameless in the sight of others seems:
4517,ROGET.,"My cause is honest, and because 'tis such"
4518,ROGET.,"I hold it so, and not for men's esteems:"
4519,ROGET.,"If they speak justly well of me, I'm glad;"
4520,ROGET.,"If falsely evil, it ne'er makes me sad."
4521,ROGET.,
4522,WILLY.,WILLY.
4523,WILLY.,
4524,WILLY.,"I like that mind; but, Roget, you are quite"
4525,WILLY.,Beside the matter that I long to hear:
4526,WILLY.,"Remember what you promised yesternight,"
4527,WILLY.,"You'd put us off with other talk, I fear;"
4528,WILLY.,"Thou know'st that honest Cuddy's heart's upright,"
4529,WILLY.,"And none but he, except myself, is near:"
4530,WILLY.,"Come therefore, and betwixt us two relate,"
4531,WILLY.,The true occasion of thy present state.
4532,WILLY.,
4533,ROGET.,ROGET.
4534,ROGET.,
4535,ROGET.,"My friends, I will; you know I am a swain,"
4536,ROGET.,That keep a poor flock here upon this plain:
4537,ROGET.,"Who, though it seems I could do nothing less,"
4538,ROGET.,"Can make a song, and woo a shepherdess;"
4539,ROGET.,And not alone the fairest where I live
4540,ROGET.,"Have heard me sing, and favours deigned to give;"
4541,ROGET.,"But though I say't, the noblest nymph of Thame,"
4542,ROGET.,Hath graced my verse unto my greater fame.
4543,ROGET.,"Yet being young, and not much seeking praise,"
4544,ROGET.,"I was not noted out for shepherds' lays,"
4545,ROGET.,"Nor feeding flocks, as you know others be:"
4546,ROGET.,For the delight that most possessed me
4547,ROGET.,"Was hunting foxes, wolves, and beasts of prey;"
4548,ROGET.,"That spoil our folds, and bear our lambs away."
4549,ROGET.,"For this, as also for the love I bear"
4550,ROGET.,"Unto my country, I laid by all care"
4551,ROGET.,"Of gain, or of preferment, with desire"
4552,ROGET.,"Only to keep that state I had entire,"
4553,ROGET.,And like a true-grown huntsman sought to speed
4554,ROGET.,"Myself with hounds of rare and choicest breed,"
4555,ROGET.,"Whose names and natures ere I further go,"
4556,ROGET.,"Because you are my friends, I'll let you know."
4557,ROGET.,"My first esteemed dog that I did find,"
4558,ROGET.,Was by descent of old Actaeon's kind;
4559,ROGET.,"A brach, which if I do not aim amiss,"
4560,ROGET.,For all the world is just like one of his:
4561,ROGET.,"She's named Love, and scarce yet knows her duty;"
4562,ROGET.,"Her dam's my lady's pretty beagle Beauty,"
4563,ROGET.,"I bred her up myself with wondrous charge,"
4564,ROGET.,"Until she grew to be exceeding large,"
4565,ROGET.,"And waxed so wanton that I did abhor it,"
4566,ROGET.,And put her out amongst my neighbours for it.
4567,ROGET.,"The next is Lust, a hound that's kept abroad,"
4568,ROGET.,"'Mongst some of mine acquaintance, but a toad"
4569,ROGET.,Is not more loathsome: 'tis a cur will range
4570,ROGET.,"Extremely, and is ever full of mange;"
4571,ROGET.,"And 'cause it is infectious, she's not wont"
4572,ROGET.,"To come among the rest, but when they hunt."
4573,ROGET.,"Hate is the third, a hound both deep and long."
4574,ROGET.,His sire is true or else supposed Wrong.
4575,ROGET.,"He'll have a snap at all that pass him by,"
4576,ROGET.,And yet pursues his game most eagerly.
4577,ROGET.,"With him goes Envy coupled, a lean cur,"
4578,ROGET.,"And she'll hold out, hunt we ne'er so far:"
4579,ROGET.,"She pineth much, and feedeth little too,"
4580,ROGET.,Yet stands and snarleth at the rest that do.
4581,ROGET.,"Then there's Revenge, a wondrous deep-mouthed dog,"
4582,ROGET.,"So fleet, I'm fain to hunt him with a clog,"
4583,ROGET.,"Yet many times he'll much outstrip his bounds,"
4584,ROGET.,And hunts not closely with the other hounds:
4585,ROGET.,He'll venture on a lion in his ire;
4586,ROGET.,"Curst Choler was his dam, and Wrong his sire."
4587,ROGET.,"This Choler is a brach that's very old,"
4588,ROGET.,And spends her mouth too much to have it hold:
4589,ROGET.,"She's very testy, an unpleasing cur,"
4590,ROGET.,"That bites the very stones, if they but stur:"
4591,ROGET.,"Or when that ought but her displeasure moves,"
4592,ROGET.,She'll bite and snap at any one she loves:
4593,ROGET.,"But my quick-scented'st dog is Jealousy,"
4594,ROGET.,The truest of this breed's in Italy:
4595,ROGET.,"The dam of mine would hardly fill a glove,"
4596,ROGET.,"It was a lady's little dog, called Love:"
4597,ROGET.,"The sire, a poor deformed cur, named Fear,"
4598,ROGET.,As shagged and as rough as is a bear:
4599,ROGET.,"And yet the whelp turned after neither kind,"
4600,ROGET.,"For he is very large, and near-hand blind;"
4601,ROGET.,"At the first sight he hath a pretty colour,"
4602,ROGET.,"But doth not seem so, when you view him fuller;"
4603,ROGET.,"A vile suspicious beast, his looks are bad,"
4604,ROGET.,And I do fear in time he will grow mad.
4605,ROGET.,"To him I couple Avarice, still poor;"
4606,ROGET.,Yet she devours as much as twenty more:
4607,ROGET.,"A thousand horse she in her paunch can put,"
4608,ROGET.,Yet whine as if she had an empty gut:
4609,ROGET.,"And having gorged what might a land have found,"
4610,ROGET.,"She'll catch for more, and hide it in the ground."
4611,ROGET.,Ambition is a hound as greedy full;
4612,ROGET.,But he for all the daintiest bits doth cull:
4613,ROGET.,"He scorns to lick up crumbs beneath the table,"
4614,ROGET.,"He'll fetch 't from boards and shelves, if he be able:"
4615,ROGET.,"Nay, he can climb if need be; and for that,"
4616,ROGET.,With him I hunt the martin and the cat:
4617,ROGET.,"And yet sometimes in mounting he's so quick,"
4618,ROGET.,He fetches falls are like to break his neck.
4619,ROGET.,"Fear is well-mouth'd, but subject to distrust;"
4620,ROGET.,A stranger cannot make him take a crust:
4621,ROGET.,"A little thing will soon his courage quail,"
4622,ROGET.,And 'twixt his legs he ever claps his tail;
4623,ROGET.,"With him Despair now often coupled goes,"
4624,ROGET.,Which by his roaring mouth each huntsman knows.
4625,ROGET.,"None hath a better mind unto the game,"
4626,ROGET.,"But he gives off, and always seemeth lame."
4627,ROGET.,"My bloodhound Cruelty, as swift as wind,"
4628,ROGET.,"Hunts to the death, and never comes behind;"
4629,ROGET.,"Who but she's strapp'd and muzzled too withal,"
4630,ROGET.,"Would eat her fellows, and the prey and all;"
4631,ROGET.,"And yet she cares not much for any food,"
4632,ROGET.,Unless it be the purest harmless blood.
4633,ROGET.,"All these are kept abroad at charge of many,"
4634,ROGET.,They do not cost me in a year a penny.
4635,ROGET.,"But there's two couple of a middling size,"
4636,ROGET.,That seldom pass the sight of my own eyes.
4637,ROGET.,"Hope, on whose head I've laid my life to pawn;"
4638,ROGET.,"Compassion, that on every one will fawn."
4639,ROGET.,"This would, when 'twas a whelp, with rabbits play"
4640,ROGET.,"Or lambs, and let them go unhurt away:"
4641,ROGET.,"Nay, now she is of growth, she'll now and then"
4642,ROGET.,"Catch you a hare, and let her go again."
4643,ROGET.,"The two last, Joy and Sorrow, 'tis a wonder,"
4644,ROGET.,"Can ne'er agree, nor ne'er bide far asunder."
4645,ROGET.,"Joy's ever wanton, and no order knows:"
4646,ROGET.,"She'll run at larks, or stand and bark at crows."
4647,ROGET.,"Sorrow goes by her, and ne'er moves his eye;"
4648,ROGET.,Yet both do serve to help make up the cry.
4649,ROGET.,"Then comes behind all these to bear the base,"
4650,ROGET.,"Two couple more of a far larger race,"
4651,ROGET.,"Such wide-mouth'd trollops, that 'twould do you good"
4652,ROGET.,To hear their loud loud echoes tear the wood.
4653,ROGET.,"There's Vanity, who, by her gaudy hide,"
4654,ROGET.,"May far away from all the rest be spied,"
4655,ROGET.,"Though huge, yet quick, for she's now here, now there;"
4656,ROGET.,"Nay, look about you, and she's everywhere:"
4657,ROGET.,"Yet ever with the rest, and still in chase."
4658,ROGET.,"Right so, Inconstancy fills every place;"
4659,ROGET.,"And yet so strange a fickle-natured hound,"
4660,ROGET.,"Look for her, and she's nowhere to be found."
4661,ROGET.,"Weakness is no fair dog unto the eye,"
4662,ROGET.,And yet she hath her proper quality;
4663,ROGET.,"But there's Presumption, when he heat hath got,"
4664,ROGET.,He drowns the thunder and the cannon-shot:
4665,ROGET.,"And when at start he his full roaring makes,"
4666,ROGET.,"The earth doth tremble, and the heaven shakes."
4667,ROGET.,"These were my dogs, ten couple just in all,"
4668,ROGET.,Whom by the name of Satyrs I do call:
4669,ROGET.,"Mad curs they be, and I can ne'er come nigh them,"
4670,ROGET.,But I'm in danger to be bitten by them.
4671,ROGET.,"Much pains I took, and spent days not a few,"
4672,ROGET.,"To make them keep together, and hunt true:"
4673,ROGET.,"Which yet I do suppose had never been,"
4674,ROGET.,But that I had a scourge to keep them in.
4675,ROGET.,"Now when that I this kennel first had got,"
4676,ROGET.,"Out of my own demesnes I hunted not,"
4677,ROGET.,"Save on these downs, or among yonder rocks,"
4678,ROGET.,After those beasts that spoiled our parish flocks;
4679,ROGET.,Nor during that time was I ever wont
4680,ROGET.,With all my kennel in one day to hunt:
4681,ROGET.,"Nor had done yet, but that this other year,"
4682,ROGET.,"Some beasts of prey, that haunt the deserts here,"
4683,ROGET.,Did not alone for many nights together
4684,ROGET.,"Devour, sometime a lamb, sometime a wether,"
4685,ROGET.,"And so disquiet many a poor man's herd,"
4686,ROGET.,But that of losing all they were afeard:
4687,ROGET.,"Yea, I among the rest did fare as bad,"
4688,ROGET.,"Or rather worse, for the best ewes[1] I had"
4689,ROGET.,(Whose breed should be my means of life and gain)
4690,ROGET.,Were in one evening by these monsters slain:
4691,ROGET.,"Which mischief I resolved to repay,"
4692,ROGET.,"Or else grow desperate, and hunt all away;"
4693,ROGET.,For in a fury (such as you shall see
4694,ROGET.,Huntsmen in missing of their sport will be)
4695,ROGET.,"I vowed a monster should not lurk about,"
4696,ROGET.,"In all this province, but I'd find him out,"
4697,ROGET.,"And thereupon, without respect or care,"
4698,ROGET.,"How lame, how full, or how unfit they were,"
4699,ROGET.,"In haste unkennell'd all my roaring crew,"
4700,ROGET.,"Who were as mad as if my mind they knew,"
4701,ROGET.,"And ere they trail'd a flight-shot, the fierce curs"
4702,ROGET.,"Had roused a hart, and thorough brakes and furs"
4703,ROGET.,"Follow'd at gaze so close, that Love and Fear"
4704,ROGET.,"Got in together, so had surely there"
4705,ROGET.,"Quite overthrown him, but that Hope thrust in"
4706,ROGET.,"'Twixt both, and saved the pinching of his skin,"
4707,ROGET.,"Whereby he 'scaped, till coursing o'erthwart,"
4708,ROGET.,"Despair came in, and griped him to the heart:"
4709,ROGET.,"I hallowed in the res'due to the fall,"
4710,ROGET.,"And for an entrance, there I fleshed them all:"
4711,ROGET.,"Which having done, I dipped my staff in blood,"
4712,ROGET.,And onward led my thunder to the wood;
4713,ROGET.,"Where what they did, I'll tell you out anon,"
4714,ROGET.,"My keeper calls me, and I must be gone."
4715,ROGET.,"Go if you please a while, attend your flocks,"
4716,ROGET.,"And when the sun is over yonder rocks,"
4717,ROGET.,"Come to this cave again, where I will be,"
4718,ROGET.,If that my guardian so much favour me.

4799,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
4800,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
4801,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","The author of 'Gondibert,' was the son of a vintner in Oxford, and born"
4802,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",in February 1605. Gossip says--but says with her usual carelessness about
4803,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","truth--that he was the son of no less a person than William Shakspeare,"
4804,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","who used, in his journeys between London and Stratford, to stop at the"
4805,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Crown, an inn kept by Davenant's reputed father. This story is hinted at"
4806,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","by Wood, was told to Pope by Betterton the player, and believed by Malone,"
4807,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",but seems to be a piece of mere scandal. It is true that Davenant had a
4808,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","great veneration for Shakspeare, and expressed it, when only ten years"
4809,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","old, in lines 'In remembrance of Master William Shakspeare,' beginning"
4810,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",thus:--
4811,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
4812,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","'Beware, delighted poets, when you sing,"
4813,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","To welcome nature in the early spring,"
4814,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Your numerous feet not tread
4815,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","The banks of Avon, for each flower"
4816,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",(As it ne'er knew a sun or shower)
4817,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Hangs there the pensive head.'
4818,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
4819,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Southey says--'The father was a man of melancholy temperament, the mother"
4820,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",handsome and lively; and as Shakspeare used to put up at the house on his
4821,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","journeys between Stratford and London, Davenant is said to have affected"
4822,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","the reputation of being Shakspeare's son. If he really did this, there"
4823,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","was a levity, or rather a want of feeling, in the boast, for which social"
4824,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","pleasantry, and the spirits which are induced by wine, afford but little"
4825,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",excuse.'
4826,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",
4827,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",He was entered at Lincoln College; he next became page to the Duchess of
4828,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Richmond; and we find him afterwards in the family of Fulk Greville, Lord"
4829,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Brooke--famous as the friend of Sir Philip Sidney. He began to write for
4830,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",the stage in 1628; and on the death of Ben Jonson he was made Poet Laureate
4831,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","--to the disappointment of Thomas May, so much praised by Johnson and"
4832,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","others for his proficiency in Latin poetry, as displayed in his supplement"
4833,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",to Lucan's 'Pharsalia.' He became afterwards manager of Drury Lane; but
4834,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","owing to his connexion with the intrigues of that unhappy period, he was"
4835,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","imprisoned in the Tower, and subsequently made his escape to France. On his"
4836,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","return to England, he distinguished himself greatly in the Royal cause; and"
4837,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","when that became desperate, he again took refuge in France, and wrote part"
4838,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",of his 'Gondibert.' He projected a scheme for carrying over a colony to
4839,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",Virginia; but his vessel was seized by one of the Parliamentary ships--he
4840,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","himself was conveyed a prisoner to Cowes Castle, in the Isle of Wight, and"
4841,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","thence to the Tower, preparatory to being tried by the High Commission. But"
4842,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","a giant hand, worthy of having saved him had he been Shakspeare's veritable"
4843,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","son, was now stretched forth to his rescue--the hand of Milton. In this"
4844,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","generous act Milton was seconded by Whitelocke, and by two aldermen of"
4845,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","York, to whom our poet had rendered some services. Liberated from the"
4846,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Tower, Davenant was also permitted, through the influence of Whitelocke,"
4847,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","to open, in defiance of Puritanic prohibition, a kind of theatre at Rutland"
4848,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","House, and by enacting his own plays there, he managed to support himself"
4849,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","till the Restoration. He then, it is supposed, repaid to Milton his"
4850,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","friendly service, and shielded him from the wrath of the Court. From this"
4851,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",period Davenant continued to write for the stage--having received the
4852,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","patent of the Duke's Theatre, in Lincoln's Inn--till his death. This event"
4853,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","took place on April 7, 1668. His last play, written in conjunction with"
4854,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","Dryden, was an alteration and pollution of Shakspeare's 'Tempest,' which"
4855,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",was more worthy of Trincula than of the authors of 'Absalom and Ahithophel'
4856,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","and of 'Gondibert.' Supposing Davenant the son of Shakspeare, his act to"
4857,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,","his father's masterpiece reminds us, in the excess of its filial impiety,"
4858,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",of Ham's conduct to Noah.
4859,"SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT,",

4876,THE ARGUMENT.,How calm in peace and tempest-like in war.
4877,THE ARGUMENT.,"The stag is by the numerous chase subdued,"
4878,THE ARGUMENT.,And straight his hunters are as hard pursued.
4879,THE ARGUMENT.,
4880,THE ARGUMENT.,1  Small are the seeds Fate does unheeded sow
4881,THE ARGUMENT.,Of slight beginnings to important ends;

4884,THE ARGUMENT.,
4885,THE ARGUMENT.,"2  For from a day's brief pleasure did proceed,"

4890,THE ARGUMENT.,"3  In a fair forest, near Verona's plain,"

4892,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Duke, with many lovers in his train,"
4893,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loyal and young, a solemn hunting made."
4894,THE ARGUMENT.,
4895,THE ARGUMENT.,4  Much was his train enlarged by their resort
4896,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who much his grandsire loved, and hither came"
4897,THE ARGUMENT.,"To celebrate this day with annual sport,"
4898,THE ARGUMENT.,"On which by battle here he earned his fame,"
4899,THE ARGUMENT.,
4900,THE ARGUMENT.,5  And many of these noble hunters bore
4901,THE ARGUMENT.,Command amongst the youth at Bergamo;
4902,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose fathers gathered here the wreaths they wore,"
4903,THE ARGUMENT.,When in this forest they interred the foe.
4904,THE ARGUMENT.,
4905,THE ARGUMENT.,"6  Count Hurgonil, a youth of high descent,"

4907,THE ARGUMENT.,"He followed honour, when towards death it went;"
4908,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce in a charge, but temperate in retreat."
4909,THE ARGUMENT.,
4910,THE ARGUMENT.,"7  His wondrous beauty, which the world approved,"
4911,THE ARGUMENT.,"He blushing hid, and now no more would own"
4912,THE ARGUMENT.,(Since he the Duke's unequalled sister loved)
4913,THE ARGUMENT.,Than an old wreath when newly overthrown.
4914,THE ARGUMENT.,
4915,THE ARGUMENT.,"8  And she, Orna the shy! did seem in life"
4916,THE ARGUMENT.,"So bashful too, to have her beauty shown,"
4917,THE ARGUMENT.,"As I may doubt her shade with Fame at strife,"
4918,THE ARGUMENT.,That in these vicious times would make it known.
4919,THE ARGUMENT.,
4920,THE ARGUMENT.,9  Not less in public voice was Arnold here;
4921,THE ARGUMENT.,He that on Tuscan tombs his trophies raised;
4922,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now Love's power so willingly did bear,"
4923,THE ARGUMENT.,That even his arbitrary reign he praised.
4924,THE ARGUMENT.,
4925,THE ARGUMENT.,"10 Laura, the Duke's fair niece, enthralled his heart,"
4926,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who was in court the public morning glass,"

4935,THE ARGUMENT.,"12 In gentle sonnets he for Laura pined,"

4950,THE ARGUMENT.,"15 If love's just power he did not early see,"
4951,THE ARGUMENT.,Some small excuse we may his error give;
4952,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since few, though learn'd, know yet blest love to be"
4953,THE ARGUMENT.,That secret vital heat by which we live:
4954,THE ARGUMENT.,
4955,THE ARGUMENT.,16 But such it is; and though we may be thought
4956,THE ARGUMENT.,"To have in childhood life, ere love we know,"
4957,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet life is useless till by reason taught,"
4958,THE ARGUMENT.,And love and reason up together grow.
4959,THE ARGUMENT.,
4960,THE ARGUMENT.,"17 Nor more the old show they outlive their love,"
4961,THE ARGUMENT.,"If, when their love's decayed, some signs they give"
4962,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of life, because we see them pained and move,"

4965,THE ARGUMENT.,"18 If we call living, life, when love is gone,"

4980,THE ARGUMENT.,"21 Public his valour was, but not his love,"
4981,THE ARGUMENT.,"One filled the world, the other he contained;"

4990,THE ARGUMENT.,23 New like a giant lover rose the sun
4991,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the ocean queen, fine in his fires and great;"

4998,THE ARGUMENT.,"With daily fire, now for the chase prepare."
4999,THE ARGUMENT.,
5000,THE ARGUMENT.,"25 All were, like hunters, clad in cheerful green,"

5005,THE ARGUMENT.,"26 These martial favours on their waists they wear,"

5014,THE ARGUMENT.,
5015,THE ARGUMENT.,"28 Cheered as the woods, where new-waked choirs they meet,"
5016,THE ARGUMENT.,Are all; and now dispose their choice relays
5017,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of horse and hounds, each like each other fleet;"
5018,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which best, when with themselves compared, we praise."
5019,THE ARGUMENT.,
5020,THE ARGUMENT.,"29 To them old forest spies, the harbourers,"
5021,THE ARGUMENT.,"With haste approach, wet as still weeping night,"

5025,THE ARGUMENT.,"30 And dogs, such whose cold secrecy was meant"

5027,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wise, temperate lime-hounds that proclaim no scent,"
5028,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor harb'ring will their mouths in boasting spend.
5029,THE ARGUMENT.,
5030,THE ARGUMENT.,"31 Yet vainlier far than traitors boast their prize,"
5031,THE ARGUMENT.,"On which their vehemence vast rates does lay,"
5032,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since in that worth their treason's credit lies,"
5033,THE ARGUMENT.,These harb'rers praise that which they now betray.
5034,THE ARGUMENT.,
5035,THE ARGUMENT.,"32 Boast they have lodged a stag, that all the race"
5036,THE ARGUMENT.,"Outruns of Croton horse, or Rhegian hounds;"
5037,THE ARGUMENT.,"A stag made long since royal in the chase,"
5038,THE ARGUMENT.,If kings can honour give by giving wounds.
5039,THE ARGUMENT.,
5040,THE ARGUMENT.,"33 For Aribert had pierced him at a bay,"
5041,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet 'scaped he by the vigour of his head;
5042,THE ARGUMENT.,"And many a summer since has won the day,"
5043,THE ARGUMENT.,And often left his Rhegian followers dead.
5044,THE ARGUMENT.,
5045,THE ARGUMENT.,"34 His spacious beam, that even the rights outgrew,"
5046,THE ARGUMENT.,"From antler to his troch had all allowed,"
5047,THE ARGUMENT.,"By which his age the aged woodmen knew,"
5048,THE ARGUMENT.,Who more than he were of that beauty proud.
5049,THE ARGUMENT.,
5050,THE ARGUMENT.,"35 Now each relay a several station finds,"
5051,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere the triumphant train the copse surrounds;
5052,THE ARGUMENT.,"Relays of horse, long breathed as winter winds,"
5053,THE ARGUMENT.,And their deep cannon-mouthed experienced hounds.
5054,THE ARGUMENT.,
5055,THE ARGUMENT.,"36 The huntsmen, busily concerned in show,"
5056,THE ARGUMENT.,"As if the world were by this beast undone,"
5057,THE ARGUMENT.,"And they against him hired as Nature's foe,"

5059,THE ARGUMENT.,
5060,THE ARGUMENT.,"37 Now wind they a recheat, the roused deer's knell,"

5065,THE ARGUMENT.,38 Tyrannic man! thy subjects' enemy!
5066,THE ARGUMENT.,"And more through wantonness than need or hate,"

5069,THE ARGUMENT.,
5070,THE ARGUMENT.,"39 So this, the most successful of his kind,"
5071,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose forehead's force oft his opposers pressed,"
5072,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose swiftness left pursuers' shafts behind,"
5073,THE ARGUMENT.,Is now of all the forest most distressed!
5074,THE ARGUMENT.,
5075,THE ARGUMENT.,"40 The herd deny him shelter, as if taught"
5076,THE ARGUMENT.,To know their safety is to yield him lost;

5079,THE ARGUMENT.,
5080,THE ARGUMENT.,"41 We blush to see our politics in beasts,"

5085,THE ARGUMENT.,"42 His rivals, that his fury used to fear"

5088,THE ARGUMENT.,(O mighty love!) his hunters were undone.
5089,THE ARGUMENT.,
5090,THE ARGUMENT.,"43 From thence, well blown, he comes to the relay,"
5091,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where man's famed reason proves but cowardice,"
5092,THE ARGUMENT.,And only serves him meanly to betray;
5093,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even for the flying, man in ambush lies."
5094,THE ARGUMENT.,
5095,THE ARGUMENT.,"44 But now, as his last remedy to live,"
5096,THE ARGUMENT.,"(For every shift for life kind Nature makes,"
5097,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since life the utmost is which she can give,)"
5098,THE ARGUMENT.,Cool Adice from the swoln bank he takes.
5099,THE ARGUMENT.,
5100,THE ARGUMENT.,"45 But this fresh bath the dogs will make him leave,"
5101,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom he sure-nosed as fasting tigers found;
5102,THE ARGUMENT.,Their scent no north-east wind could e'er deceive
5103,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which drives the air, nor flocks that soil the ground."
5104,THE ARGUMENT.,
5105,THE ARGUMENT.,46 Swift here the fliers and pursuers seem;
5106,THE ARGUMENT.,"The frighted fish swim from their Adice,"
5107,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dogs pursue the deer, he the fleet stream,"
5108,THE ARGUMENT.,And that hastes too to the Adriatic sea.
5109,THE ARGUMENT.,
5110,THE ARGUMENT.,"47 Refreshed thus in this fleeting element,"
5111,THE ARGUMENT.,He up the steadfast shore did boldly rise;
5112,THE ARGUMENT.,"And soon escaped their view, but not their scent,"
5113,THE ARGUMENT.,"That faithful guide, which even conducts their eyes."
5114,THE ARGUMENT.,
5115,THE ARGUMENT.,"48 This frail relief was like short gales of breath,"
5116,THE ARGUMENT.,Which oft at sea a long dead calm prepare;
5117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or like our curtains drawn at point of death,"
5118,THE ARGUMENT.,"When all our lungs are spent, to give us air."
5119,THE ARGUMENT.,
5120,THE ARGUMENT.,49 For on the shore the hunters him attend:
5121,THE ARGUMENT.,"And whilst the chase grew warm as is the day,"
5122,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Which now from the hot zenith does descend,)"
5123,THE ARGUMENT.,"He is embossed, and wearied to a bay."
5124,THE ARGUMENT.,
5125,THE ARGUMENT.,"50 The jewel, life, he must surrender here,"
5126,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which the world's mistress, Nature, does not give,"
5127,THE ARGUMENT.,"But like dropped favours suffers us to wear,"
5128,THE ARGUMENT.,Such as by which pleased lovers think they live.
5129,THE ARGUMENT.,
5130,THE ARGUMENT.,"51 Yet life he so esteems, that he allows"
5131,THE ARGUMENT.,It all defence his force and rage can make;
5132,THE ARGUMENT.,"And to the eager dogs such fury shows,"
5133,THE ARGUMENT.,As their last blood some unrevenged forsake.
5134,THE ARGUMENT.,
5135,THE ARGUMENT.,"52 But now the monarch murderer comes in,"
5136,THE ARGUMENT.,"Destructive man! whom Nature would not arm,"
5137,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when in madness mischief is foreseen,"
5138,THE ARGUMENT.,We leave it weaponless for fear of harm.
5139,THE ARGUMENT.,
5140,THE ARGUMENT.,"53 For she defenceless made him, that he might"
5141,THE ARGUMENT.,"Less readily offend; but art arms all,"
5142,THE ARGUMENT.,From single strife makes us in numbers fight;
5143,THE ARGUMENT.,And by such art this royal stag did fall.
5144,THE ARGUMENT.,
5145,THE ARGUMENT.,54 He weeps till grief does even his murderers pierce;
5146,THE ARGUMENT.,"Grief which so nobly through his anger strove,"
5147,THE ARGUMENT.,"That it deserved the dignity of verse,"
5148,THE ARGUMENT.,"And had it words, as humanly would move."
5149,THE ARGUMENT.,
5150,THE ARGUMENT.,"55 Thrice from the ground his vanquished head he reared,"
5151,THE ARGUMENT.,And with last looks his forest walks did view;
5152,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where sixty summers he had ruled the herd,"
5153,THE ARGUMENT.,And where sharp dittany now vainly grew:
5154,THE ARGUMENT.,
5155,THE ARGUMENT.,56 Whose hoary leaves no more his wounds shall heal;
5156,THE ARGUMENT.,For with a sigh (a blast of all his breath)
5157,THE ARGUMENT.,"That viewless thing, called life, did from him steal,"
5158,THE ARGUMENT.,And with their bugle-horns they wind his death.
5159,THE ARGUMENT.,
5160,THE ARGUMENT.,"57 Then with their annual wanton sacrifice,"
5161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Taught by old custom, whose decrees are vain,"
5162,THE ARGUMENT.,"And we, like humorous antiquaries, that prize"
5163,THE ARGUMENT.,"Age, though deformed, they hasten to the plain."
5164,THE ARGUMENT.,
5165,THE ARGUMENT.,"58 Thence homeward bend as westward as the sun,"
5166,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where Gondibert's allies proud feasts prepare,"
5167,THE ARGUMENT.,That day to honour which his grandsire won;
5168,THE ARGUMENT.,Though feasts the eyes to funerals often are.
5169,THE ARGUMENT.,
5170,THE ARGUMENT.,"59 One from the forest now approached their sight,"
5171,THE ARGUMENT.,Who them did swiftly on the spur pursue;
5172,THE ARGUMENT.,"One there still resident as day and night,"
5173,THE ARGUMENT.,And known as the eldest oak which in it grew:
5174,THE ARGUMENT.,
5175,THE ARGUMENT.,"60 Who, with his utmost breath advancing, cries,"
5176,THE ARGUMENT.,"(And such a vehemence no heart could feign,)"
5177,THE ARGUMENT.,'Away! happy the man that fastest flies!
5178,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fly, famous Duke! fly with thy noble train!'"
5179,THE ARGUMENT.,
5180,THE ARGUMENT.,"61 The Duke replied: 'Though with thy fears disguised,"
5181,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou dost my sire's old ranger's image bear,"
5182,THE ARGUMENT.,And for thy kindness shalt not be despised;
5183,THE ARGUMENT.,Though counsels are but weak which come from fear.
5184,THE ARGUMENT.,
5185,THE ARGUMENT.,"62 'Were dangers here, great as thy love can shape,"
5186,THE ARGUMENT.,"And love with fear can danger multiply,"
5187,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet when by flight thou bidst us meanly 'scape,"
5188,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bid trees take wings, and rooted forests fly.'"
5189,THE ARGUMENT.,
5190,THE ARGUMENT.,63 Then said the ranger: 'You are bravely lost!'
5191,THE ARGUMENT.,(And like high anger his complexion rose.)
5192,THE ARGUMENT.,'As little know I fear as how to boast;
5193,THE ARGUMENT.,But shall attend you through your many foes.
5194,THE ARGUMENT.,
5195,THE ARGUMENT.,64 'See where in ambush mighty Oswald lay!
5196,THE ARGUMENT.,"And see, from yonder lawn he moves apace,"
5197,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lances armed to intercept thy way,"
5198,THE ARGUMENT.,Now thy sure steeds are wearied with the chase.
5199,THE ARGUMENT.,
5200,THE ARGUMENT.,"65 'His purple banners you may there behold,"
5201,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, proudly spread, the fatal raven bear;"
5202,THE ARGUMENT.,"And full five hundred I by rank have told,"
5203,THE ARGUMENT.,Who in their gilded helms his colours wear.'
5204,THE ARGUMENT.,
5205,THE ARGUMENT.,66 The Duke this falling storm does now discern;
5206,THE ARGUMENT.,Bids little Hugo fly! but 'tis to view
5207,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foe, and timely their first count'nance learn,"
5208,THE ARGUMENT.,Whilst firm he in a square his hunters drew.
5209,THE ARGUMENT.,
5210,THE ARGUMENT.,"67 And Hugo soon, light as his courser's heels,"
5211,THE ARGUMENT.,Was in their faces troublesome as wind;
5212,THE ARGUMENT.,"And like to it so wingedly he wheels,"
5213,THE ARGUMENT.,"No one could catch, what all with trouble find."
5214,THE ARGUMENT.,
5215,THE ARGUMENT.,68 But everywhere the leaders and the led
5216,THE ARGUMENT.,He temperately observed with a slow sight;
5217,THE ARGUMENT.,"Judged by their looks how hopes and fears were fed,"
5218,THE ARGUMENT.,And by their order their success in fight.
5219,THE ARGUMENT.,
5220,THE ARGUMENT.,"69 Their number, 'mounting to the ranger's guess,"
5221,THE ARGUMENT.,In three divisions evenly was disposed;
5222,THE ARGUMENT.,"And that their enemies might judge it less,"
5223,THE ARGUMENT.,It seemed one gross with all the spaces closed.
5224,THE ARGUMENT.,
5225,THE ARGUMENT.,"70 The van fierce Oswald led, where Paradine"
5226,THE ARGUMENT.,"And manly Dargonet, both of his blood,"
5227,THE ARGUMENT.,"Outshined the noon, and their minds' stock within"
5228,THE ARGUMENT.,Promised to make that outward glory good.
5229,THE ARGUMENT.,
5230,THE ARGUMENT.,"71 The next, bold, but unlucky Hubert led,"
5231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Brother to Oswald, and no less allied"
5232,THE ARGUMENT.,To the ambitions which his soul did wed;
5233,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lowly without, but lined with costly pride."
5234,THE ARGUMENT.,
5235,THE ARGUMENT.,"72 Most to himself his valour fatal was,"
5236,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose glories oft to others dreadful were;
5237,THE ARGUMENT.,"So comets, though supposed destruction's cause,"
5238,THE ARGUMENT.,But waste themselves to make their gazers fear.
5239,THE ARGUMENT.,
5240,THE ARGUMENT.,"73 And though his valour seldom did succeed,"
5241,THE ARGUMENT.,His speech was such as could in storms persuade;
5242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sweet as the hopes on which starved lovers feed,"
5243,THE ARGUMENT.,Breathed in the whispers of a yielding maid.
5244,THE ARGUMENT.,
5245,THE ARGUMENT.,"74 The bloody Borgio did conduct the rear,"
5246,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom sullen Vasco heedfully attends;
5247,THE ARGUMENT.,"To all but to themselves they cruel were,"
5248,THE ARGUMENT.,And to themselves chiefly by mischief friends.
5249,THE ARGUMENT.,
5250,THE ARGUMENT.,"75 War, the world's art, nature to them became;"
5251,THE ARGUMENT.,"In camps begot, born, and in anger bred;"
5252,THE ARGUMENT.,"The living vexed till death, and then their fame,"

5254,THE ARGUMENT.,
5255,THE ARGUMENT.,"76 Cities, wise statesmen's folds for civil sheep,"
5256,THE ARGUMENT.,"They sacked, as painful shearers of the wise;"

5258,THE ARGUMENT.,When others' prosperous toils might be their prize.
5259,THE ARGUMENT.,
5260,THE ARGUMENT.,"77 Hugo amongst these troops spied many more,"
5261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who had, as brave destroyers, got renown;"
5262,THE ARGUMENT.,"And many forward wounds in boast they wore,"

5270,THE ARGUMENT.,"79 Back to his Duke the dexterous Hugo flies,"
5271,THE ARGUMENT.,What he observed he cheerfully declares;
5272,THE ARGUMENT.,With noble pride did what he liked despise;

5666,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"This author was of the age of Spenser, and is said to have been an"
5667,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"acquaintance and friend of that poet. It was not, however, till 1683"
5668,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"that good old Izaak Walton published 'Thealma and Clearchus,' a pas-"
5669,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"toral romance, which, he stated, had been written long since by John"
5670,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"Chalkhill, Esq. He says of the author, 'that he was in his time a man"
5671,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"generally known, and as well beloved; for he was humble and obliging"
5672,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"in his behaviour--a gentleman, a scholar, very innocent and prudent,"
5673,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"and indeed his whole life was useful, quiet, and virtuous.' Some have"
5674,JOHN CHALKHILL.,suspected that this production proceeded from the pen of Walton himself.
5675,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"This, however, is rendered extremely unlikely--first, by the fact that"
5676,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"Walton, when he printed 'Thealma,' was ninety years of age; and,"
5677,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"secondly, by the difference in style and purpose between that poem and"
5678,JOHN CHALKHILL.,Walton's avowed productions. The mind of Walton was quietly ingenious;
5679,JOHN CHALKHILL.,that of the author of 'Thealma' is adventurous and fantastic. Walton
5680,JOHN CHALKHILL.,loved 'the green pastures and the still waters' of the Present; the
5681,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"other, the golden groves and ideal wildernesses of the Golden Age in"
5682,JOHN CHALKHILL.,the Past.
5683,JOHN CHALKHILL.,
5684,JOHN CHALKHILL.,'Thealma and Clearchus' may be called an 'Arcadia' in rhyme. It
5685,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"resembles that work of Sir Philip Sidney, not only in subject, but in"
5686,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"execution. Its plot is dark and puzzling, its descriptions are rich to"
5687,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"luxuriance, its narrative is tedious, and its characters are mere"
5688,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"shadows. But although a dream, it is a dream of genius, and brings"
5689,JOHN CHALKHILL.,beautifully before our imagination that early period in the world's
5690,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"history, in which poets and painters have taught us to believe, when the"
5691,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"heavens were nearer, the skies clearer, the fat of the earth richer, the"
5692,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"foam of the sea brighter, than in our degenerate days;--when shepherds,"
5693,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"reposing under broad, umbrageous oaks, saw, or thought they saw, in the"
5694,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"groves the shadow of angels, and on the mountain-summits the descending"
5695,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"footsteps of God. Chalkhill resembles, of all our modern poets, perhaps"
5696,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"Shelley most, in the ideality of his conception, the enthusiasm of his"
5697,JOHN CHALKHILL.,"spirit, and the unmitigated gorgeousness of his imagination."

6241,THOMAS STANLEY.,"poetical. He was the only son of Sir Thomas Stanley of Camberlow Green,"
6242,THOMAS STANLEY.,"in Hertfordshire, and was born in 1620. He received his education at"
6243,THOMAS STANLEY.,"Pembroke College, Oxford; and after travelling for some years abroad,"
6244,THOMAS STANLEY.,he took up his abode in the Middle Temple. Here he seems to have spent
6245,THOMAS STANLEY.,the rest of his life in patient and multifarious studies. He made
6246,THOMAS STANLEY.,"translations of some merit from Anacreon, Bion, Moschus, and the"
6247,THOMAS STANLEY.,"'Kisses' of Secundus, as well as from Marino, Boscan, Tristan, and"
6248,THOMAS STANLEY.,"Gongora. He wrote a work of great pretensions as a compilation, entitled"
6249,THOMAS STANLEY.,"'The History of Philosophy,' containing the lives, opinions, actions,"
6250,THOMAS STANLEY.,"and discourses of philosophers of every sect, of which he published the"
6251,THOMAS STANLEY.,"first volume in 1655, and completed it in a fourth in 1662. It is rather"
6252,THOMAS STANLEY.,"a vast collection of the materials for a history, than a history itself."
6253,THOMAS STANLEY.,"He is a Cudworth in magnitude and learning, but not in strength and"
6254,THOMAS STANLEY.,"comprehension, and is destitute of precision and clearness of style."
6255,THOMAS STANLEY.,"Stanley also wrote some poems, which discover powers that might have"
6256,THOMAS STANLEY.,been better employed in original composition than in translation.
6257,THOMAS STANLEY.,"His style, rich of itself, is enriched to repletion by conceits, and"
6258,THOMAS STANLEY.,sometimes by voluptuous sentiments and language. He adds a new flush to
6259,THOMAS STANLEY.,"the cheek of Anacreon himself; and his grapes are so heavy, that not a"
6260,THOMAS STANLEY.,"staff, but a wain were required to bear them. Stanley died in 1678."

6434,ANDREW MARVELL.,
6435,ANDREW MARVELL.,
6436,ANDREW MARVELL.,"This noble-minded patriot and poet, the friend of Milton, the Abdiel of a"
6437,ANDREW MARVELL.,"dark and corrupt age,--'faithful found among the faithless, faithful only"
6438,ANDREW MARVELL.,"he,'--was born in Hull in 1620. He was sent to Cambridge, and is said"
6439,ANDREW MARVELL.,"there to have nearly fallen a victim to the proselytising Jesuits, who"
6440,ANDREW MARVELL.,"enticed him to London. His father, however, a clergyman in Hull, went"
6441,ANDREW MARVELL.,"in search of and brought him back to his university, where speedily, by"
6442,ANDREW MARVELL.,"extensive culture and the vigorous exercise of his powerful faculties,"
6443,ANDREW MARVELL.,"he emancipated himself for ever from the dominion, and the danger of the"
6444,ANDREW MARVELL.,"dominion, of superstition and bigotry. We know little more about the early"
6445,ANDREW MARVELL.,"days of our poet. When only twenty, he lost his father in remarkable"
6446,ANDREW MARVELL.,"circumstances. In 1640, he had embarked on the Humber in company with a"
6447,ANDREW MARVELL.,"youthful pair whom he was to marry at Barrow, in Lincolnshire. The weather"
6448,ANDREW MARVELL.,"was calm; but Marvell, seized with a sudden presentiment of danger, threw"
6449,ANDREW MARVELL.,"his staff ashore, and cried out, 'Ho for heaven!' A storm came on, and the"
6450,ANDREW MARVELL.,"whole company perished. In consequence of this sad event, the gentleman,"
6451,ANDREW MARVELL.,"whose daughter was to have been married, conceiving that the father had"
6452,ANDREW MARVELL.,"sacrificed his life while performing an act of friendship, adopted young"
6453,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Marvell as his son. Owing to this, he received a better education, and"
6454,ANDREW MARVELL.,was sent abroad to travel. It is said that at Rome he met and formed a
6455,ANDREW MARVELL.,"friendship with Milton, then engaged on his immortal continental tour."
6456,ANDREW MARVELL.,"We find Marvell next at Constantinople, as Secretary to the English"
6457,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Embassy at that Court. We then lose sight of him till 1653, when he was"
6458,ANDREW MARVELL.,engaged by the Protector to superintend the education of a Mr Dutton at
6459,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Eton. For a year and a half after Cromwell's death, Marvell assisted"
6460,ANDREW MARVELL.,Milton as Latin Secretary to the Protector. Our readers are all familiar
6461,ANDREW MARVELL.,"with the print of Cromwell and Milton seated together at the council-table,"
6462,ANDREW MARVELL.,"--the one the express image of active power and rugged grandeur, the other"
6463,ANDREW MARVELL.,of thoughtful majesty and ethereal grace. Marvell might have been added as
6464,ANDREW MARVELL.,"a third, and become the emblem of strong English sense and incorruptible"
6465,ANDREW MARVELL.,"integrity. A letter of Milton's was, not long since, discovered, dated"
6466,ANDREW MARVELL.,"February 1652, in which he speaks of Marvell as fitted, by his knowledge"
6467,ANDREW MARVELL.,"of Latin and his experience of teaching, to be his assistant. He was not"
6468,ANDREW MARVELL.,"appointed, however, till 1657. In 1660, he became member for Hull, and was"
6469,ANDREW MARVELL.,"re-elected as long as he lived. He was absent, however, from England for"
6470,ANDREW MARVELL.,"two years, in the beginning of the reign, in Germany and Holland. After-"
6471,ANDREW MARVELL.,wards he sought leave from his constituents to act as Ambassador's
6472,ANDREW MARVELL.,Secretary to Lord Carlisle at the Northern Courts; but from the year 1665
6473,ANDREW MARVELL.,"to his death, his attention to his parliamentary duties was unremitting."
6474,ANDREW MARVELL.,He constantly corresponded with his constituents; and after the longest
6475,ANDREW MARVELL.,"sittings, he used to write out for their use a minute account of public"
6476,ANDREW MARVELL.,"proceedings ere he went to bed, or took any refreshment. He was one of"
6477,ANDREW MARVELL.,the last members who received pay from the town he represented; (2s.
6478,ANDREW MARVELL.,"a-day was probably the sum;) and his constituents were wont, besides, to"
6479,ANDREW MARVELL.,send him barrels of ale as tokens of their regard. Marvell spoke little
6480,ANDREW MARVELL.,in the House; but his heart and vote were always in the right place. Even
6481,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Prince Eupert continually consulted him, and was sometimes persuaded by"
6482,ANDREW MARVELL.,him to support the popular side; and King Charles having met him once in
6483,ANDREW MARVELL.,"private, was so delighted with his wit and agreeable manners, that he"
6484,ANDREW MARVELL.,thought him worth trying to bribe. He sent Lord Danby to offer him a mark
6485,ANDREW MARVELL.,"of his Majesty's consideration. Marvell, who was seated in a dingy room"
6486,ANDREW MARVELL.,"up several flights of stairs, declined the proffer, and, it is said,"
6487,ANDREW MARVELL.,called his servant to witness that he had dined for three successive days
6488,ANDREW MARVELL.,"on the same shoulder of mutton, and was not likely, therefore, to care"
6489,ANDREW MARVELL.,"for or need a bribe. When the Treasurer was gone, he had to send to a"
6490,ANDREW MARVELL.,"friend to borrow a guinea. Although, a silent senator, Marvell was a"
6491,ANDREW MARVELL.,copious and popular writer. He attacked Bishop Parker for his slavish
6492,ANDREW MARVELL.,"principles, in a piece entitled 'The Rehearsal Transposed,' in which he"
6493,ANDREW MARVELL.,takes occasion to vindicate and panegyrise his old colleague Milton. His
6494,ANDREW MARVELL.,anonymous 'Account of the Growth of Arbitrary Power and Popery in England'
6495,ANDREW MARVELL.,"excited a sensation, and a reward was offered for the apprehension of the"
6496,ANDREW MARVELL.,author and printer. Marvell had many of the elements of a first-rate
6497,ANDREW MARVELL.,"political pamphleteer. He had wit of a most pungent kind, great though"
6498,ANDREW MARVELL.,"coarse fertility of fancy, and a spirit of independence that nothing could"
6499,ANDREW MARVELL.,"subdue or damp. He was the undoubted ancestor of the Defoes, Swifts,"
6500,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Steeles, Juniuses, and Burkes, in whom this kind of authorship reached its"
6501,ANDREW MARVELL.,"perfection, ceased to be fugitive, and assumed classical rank."
6502,ANDREW MARVELL.,
6503,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Marvell had been repeatedly threatened with assassination, and hence,"
6504,ANDREW MARVELL.,"when he died suddenly on the 16th of August 1678, it was surmised that"
6505,ANDREW MARVELL.,he had been removed by poison. The Corporation of Hull voted a sum to
6506,ANDREW MARVELL.,"defray his funeral expenses, and for raising a monument to his memory;"
6507,ANDREW MARVELL.,"but owing to the interference of the Court, through the rector of the"
6508,ANDREW MARVELL.,"parish, this votive tablet was not at the time erected. He was buried in"
6509,ANDREW MARVELL.,St Giles-in-the-Fields.
6510,ANDREW MARVELL.,
6511,ANDREW MARVELL.,"'Out of the strong came forth sweetness,' saith the Hebrew record. And"
6512,ANDREW MARVELL.,so from the sturdy Andrew Marvell have proceeded such soft and lovely
6513,ANDREW MARVELL.,"strains as 'The Emigrants,' 'The Nymph complaining for the Death of her"
6514,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Fawn,' 'Young Love,' &c. The statue of Memnon became musical at the dawn;"
6515,ANDREW MARVELL.,"and the stern patriot, whom no bribe could buy and no flattery melt, is"
6516,ANDREW MARVELL.,found sympathising in song with a boatful of banished Englishmen in the
6517,ANDREW MARVELL.,"remote Bermudas, and inditing 'Thoughts in a Garden,' from which you might"
6518,ANDREW MARVELL.,"suppose that he had spent his life more with melons than with men, and was"
6519,ANDREW MARVELL.,better acquainted with the motions of a bee-hive than with the contests of
6520,ANDREW MARVELL.,"Parliament, and the distractions of a most distracted age. It was said"
6521,ANDREW MARVELL.,"(not with thorough truth) of Milton, that he could cut out a Colossus from"
6522,ANDREW MARVELL.,"a rock, but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones--a task which his"
6523,ANDREW MARVELL.,"assistant may be said to have performed in his stead, in his small but"
6524,ANDREW MARVELL.,delectable copies of verse.

6587,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Inconstant Sylvio, when yet"
6588,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"I had not found him counterfeit,"
6589,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,One morning (I remember well)
6590,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Tied in this silver chain and bell,"
6591,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Gave it to me: nay, and I know"
6592,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,What he said then: I'm sure I do.
6593,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Said he, 'Look how your huntsman here"
6594,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Hath taught a fawn to hunt his deer.'
6595,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,But Sylvio soon had me beguiled.
6596,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"This waxed tame while he grew wild,"
6597,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"And, quite regardless of my smart,"
6598,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Left me his fawn, but took his heart."
6599,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Thenceforth I set myself to play
6600,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,My solitary time away
6601,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"With this, and very well content"
6602,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Could so my idle life have spent;
6603,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"For it was full of sport, and light"
6604,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Of foot and heart; and did invite
6605,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Me to its game; it seemed to bless
6606,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Itself in me. How could I less
6607,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Than love it? Oh, I cannot be"
6608,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Unkind to a beast that loveth me!
6609,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Had it lived long, I do not know"
6610,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Whether it too might have done so
6611,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,As Sylvio did; his gifts might be
6612,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Perhaps as false, or more, than he."
6613,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"But I am sure, for aught that I"
6614,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Could in so short a time espy,"
6615,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Thy love was far more better than
6616,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,The love of false and cruel man.
6617,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,With sweetest milk and sugar first
6618,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,I it at my own fingers nursed;
6619,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"And as it grew, so every day"
6620,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,It waxed more white and sweet than they:
6621,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,It had so sweet a breath; and oft
6622,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,I blushed to see its foot more soft
6623,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"And white, shall I say, than my hand?"
6624,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Nay, any lady's of the land."
6625,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,It is a wondrous thing how fleet
6626,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,'Twas on those little silver feet;
6627,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,With what a pretty skipping grace
6628,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,It oft would challenge me the race;
6629,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"And when't had left me far away,"
6630,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;"
6631,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"For it was nimbler much than hinds,"
6632,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,And trod as if on the four winds.
6633,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"I have a garden of my own,"
6634,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"But so with roses overgrown,"
6635,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"And lilies, that you would it guess"
6636,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"To be a little wilderness,"
6637,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,And all the spring-time of the year
6638,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,It only loved to be there.
6639,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Among the beds of lilies I
6640,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Have sought it oft where it should lie,"
6641,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Yet could not, till itself would rise,"
6642,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Find it, although before mine eyes;"
6643,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,For in the flaxen lilies' shade
6644,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,It like a bank of lilies laid;
6645,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Upon the roses it would feed,"
6646,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,Until its lips e'en seemed to bleed;
6647,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"And then to me 'twould boldly trip,"
6648,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,And print those roses on my lip.
6649,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,But all its chief delight was still
6650,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"On roses thus itself to fill,"
6651,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,And its pure virgin limbs to fold
6652,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,In whitest sheets of lilies cold.
6653,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Had it lived long, it would have been"
6654,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN.,"Lilies without, roses within. * * *"

6881,IZAAK WALTON.,"This amiable enemy of the finny tribe was born in Stafford, in August"
6882,IZAAK WALTON.,"1593. We hear of him first as settled in London, following the trade"
6883,IZAAK WALTON.,"of a sempster, or linen-draper, having a shop in the Royal Burse, in"
6884,IZAAK WALTON.,"Cornhill, which was 'seven feet and a half long, and five wide,' and"
6885,IZAAK WALTON.,where he became possessed of a moderate fortune. He spent his leisure
6886,IZAAK WALTON.,"time in fishing 'with honest Nat and R. Roe.' From the Royal Burse, he"
6887,IZAAK WALTON.,"removed to Fleet Street, where he had 'one half of a shop,' a hosier"
6888,IZAAK WALTON.,"occupying the other half. In 1632, he married Anne, the daughter of"
6889,IZAAK WALTON.,"Thomas Ken of Furnival's Inn, and sister of Dr Ken, the celebrated"
6890,IZAAK WALTON.,"Bishop of Bath and Wells. Through her and her kindred, he became"
6891,IZAAK WALTON.,"acquainted with many eminent men of the day. His wife, 'a woman of"
6892,IZAAK WALTON.,"remarkable prudence and primitive piety,' died long before him. He"
6893,IZAAK WALTON.,"retired from business in 1643, and lived, for forty years after, a life"
6894,IZAAK WALTON.,"of leisure and quiet enjoyment, spending much of his time in the houses"
6895,IZAAK WALTON.,"of his friends, and much of it by the still waters, which he so dearly"
6896,IZAAK WALTON.,loved. Walton commenced his literary career by writing a Life of Dr
6897,IZAAK WALTON.,"Donne, and followed with another of Sir Henry Wotton, prefixed to his"
6898,IZAAK WALTON.,"literary remains. In 1653 appeared his 'Complete Angler,' four editions"
6899,IZAAK WALTON.,"of which were called for before his decease. He wrote, in 1662, a Life"
6900,IZAAK WALTON.,"of Richard Hooker; in 1670, a Life of George Herbert; and, in 1678, a"
6901,IZAAK WALTON.,Life of Bishop Sanderson--all distinguished by _naïveté_ and heart. In
6902,IZAAK WALTON.,"1680, he published an anonymous discourse on the 'Distempers of the"
6903,IZAAK WALTON.,"Times.' In 1683, he printed, as we have seen, Chalkhill's 'Thealma and"
6904,IZAAK WALTON.,"Clearchus;' and on the 15th of December in the same year, he died at"
6905,IZAAK WALTON.,"Winchester, while residing with his son-in-law, Dr Hawkins, Prebendary"

6973,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","We hear of the Spirit of Evil on one occasion entering into swine, but,"
6974,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","if possible, a stranger sight is that of the Spirit of Poesy finding a"
6975,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",similar incarnation. Certainly the connexion of genius in the Earl of
6976,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",Rochester with a life of the most degrading and desperate debauchery is
6977,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",one of the chief marvels of this marvellous world.
6978,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
6979,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","John Wilmot was the son of Henry, Lord Rochester, and was born April 10,"
6980,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","1647, at Ditchley in Oxfordshire. He was taught grammar at the school of"
6981,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Burford. He then 'entered a nobleman' into Wadham College, when twelve"
6982,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","years old, and at 1661, when only fourteen, he was, in conjunction with"
6983,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","some others of rank, made M.A. by Lord Clarendon in person. Pursuing his"
6984,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","travels in France and Italy, he went in 1665 to sea with the Earl of"
6985,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Sandwich, and distinguished himself at Bergen in an attack on the Dutch"
6986,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","fleet. Next year, while serving under Sir Edward Spragge, his commander"
6987,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",sent him in the heat of an engagement with a reproof to one of his
6988,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",captains--a duty which Wilmot gallantly accomplished amidst a storm of
6989,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",shot. With this early courage some of his biographers have contrasted
6990,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","his subsequent reputation for cowardice, his slinking away out of"
6991,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","street-quarrels, his refusing to fight the Duke of Buckingham, &c. This"
6992,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",diversity at different periods may perhaps be accounted for on the
6993,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","ground of the nervousness which continued dissipation produces, and"
6994,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","perhaps from his poetical temperament. A poet, we are persuaded, is"
6995,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","often the bravest, and often the most pusillanimous of men. Byron was"
6996,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","unquestionably in general a brave, almost a pugnacious man; and yet he"
6997,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","confesses that at certain times, had one proceeded to horsewhip him,"
6998,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","he would not have had the hardihood to resist. Shelley, who, in a"
6999,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","tremendous storm, behaved with dauntless heroism, and who would at any"
7000,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","time have acted on the example of his own character in 'Prometheus,'"
7001,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","who, in a shipwreck,"
7002,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
7003,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",'gave an enemy
7004,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","His plank, then plunged aside to die,'"
7005,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
7006,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","was yet subject to paroxysms of nervous horror, which made him perspire"
7007,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",and tremble like a spirit-seeing steed. Rochester had the same
7008,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","temperament, and a similar creed, with these men, although inferior to"
7009,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",them both in _morale_ and in genius.
7010,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
7011,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",His character was certainly very depraved. He told Burnet on his
7012,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","deathbed that for five years he had not known the sensation of sobriety,"
7013,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","having been all that time either totally drunk, or mad through the dregs"
7014,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","of drunkenness. He on one occasion, while in this state, erected a stage"
7015,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","on Tower Hill, and addressed the mob as a naked mountebank. Even after"
7016,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","he became more temperate, he continued and even increased his"
7017,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","licentiousness--one devil went out, and seven entered in. He pursued low"
7018,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",amours in disguise; he practised occasionally as a quack doctor; and at
7019,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","other times he retired to the country, and, like Byron, amused himself"
7020,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",by libelling all his acquaintances--every line in each libel being a
7021,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","lie. Notwithstanding all this, he was a favourite with Charles II., who"
7022,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","made him one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber, and comptroller of"
7023,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Woodstock Park. In his lucid intervals he recurred to his studies, wrote"
7024,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","occasional verses, read in French Boileau and in English Cowley, and is"
7025,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",called by Wood the best scholar among all the nobility.
7026,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
7027,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","At last, ere he was thirty-one, the 'dreary old sort of feel,' and the"
7028,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","'rigid fibre and stiffening limbs,' of which Byron and Burns, when"
7029,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","scarcely older, complained, began to assail Rochester. He had exhausted"
7030,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","his capacity of enjoyment by excess, and had deprived himself of the"
7031,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",consolations of religion by infidelity. His unbelief was not like
7032,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Shelley's--the growth of his own mind, and the fruit of unbridled,"
7033,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","though earnest, speculation;--it was merely a drug which he snatched"
7034,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","from the laboratories of others to deaden his remorse, and enable him to"
7035,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",look with desperate calmness to the blotted Past and the lowering
7036,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Future. At this stage of his career, he became acquainted with Bishop"
7037,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Burnet, who has recorded his conversion and edifying end in a book"
7038,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","which, says Johnson, 'the critic ought to read for its elegance, the"
7039,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","philosopher for its arguments, and the saint for its piety.' To this,"
7040,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","after Johnson's example, we refer our readers. Eochester died July 26,"
7041,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","1680, before he had completed his thirty-fourth year. He was married,"
7042,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","and left three daughters and a son named Charles, who did not long"
7043,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","survive his father. With him the male line ceased, and the title was"
7044,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",conferred on a younger son of Lord Clarendon. His poems appeared in the
7045,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","year of his death, professing on the title-page to be printed at"
7046,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Antwerp. They contain much that is spurious, but some productions that"
7047,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","are undoubtedly Rochester's. They are at the best, poor fragmentary"
7048,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","exhibitions of a vigorous, but undisciplined mind. His songs are rather"
7049,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",easy than lively. His imitations are distinguished by grace and spirit.
7050,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","His 'Nothing' is a tissue of clever conceits, like gaudy weeds growing"
7051,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","on a sterile soil, but here and there contains a grand and gloomy image,"
7052,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",such as--
7053,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
7054,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",'And rebel Light obscured thy reverend dusky face.'
7055,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
7056,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","His 'Satire against Man' might be praised for its vigorous misanthropy,"
7057,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",but is chiefly copied from Boileau.
7058,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",
7059,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",Rochester may be signalised as the first thoroughly depraved and vicious
7060,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","person, so far as we remember, who assumed the office of the satirist,"
7061,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","--the first, although not, alas! the last human imitator of 'Satan"
7062,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","accusing Sin.' Some satirists before him had been faulty characters,"
7063,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","while rather inconsistently assailing the faults of others; but here,"
7064,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","for the first time, was a man of no virtue, or belief in virtue whatever,"
7065,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","(his tenderness to his family, revealed in his letters, is just that of"
7066,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","the tiger fondling his cubs, and seeming, perhaps, to _them_ a 'much-"
7067,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","misrepresented character,') and whose life was one mass of wounds,"
7068,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","bruises, and putrefying sores,--a naked satyr who gloried in his shame,"
7069,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",--becoming a severe castigator of public morals and of private character.
7070,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER","Surely there was a gross anomaly implied in this, which far greater"
7071,"JOHN WILMOT, EARL OF ROCHESTER",genius than Rochester's could never have redeemed.

7112,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
7113,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Wentworth Dillon, Earl of Roscommon, was the son of James Dillon and"
7114,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Elizabeth Wentworth. She was the sister of the infamous Strafford, who"
7115,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,was at once uncle and godfather to our poet. In what exact year Dillon
7116,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"was born is uncertain, but it was some time about 1633. His father had"
7117,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,been converted from Popery by Usher; and when the Irish Rebellion broke
7118,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"out, Strafford, afraid of the fury of the Irish, sent for his godson,"
7119,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"and took him to his own seat in Yorkshire, where he was taught Latin"
7120,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"with great care. He was sent afterwards to Caen, where he studied under"
7121,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,Bochart. It is said that while playing extravagantly there at the
7122,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"customary games of boys, he suddenly paused, became grave, and cried"
7123,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"out, 'My father is dead,' and that a fortnight after arrived tidings"
7124,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,from Ireland confirming his impression. Johnson is inclined to believe
7125,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"this story, and we are more than inclined. Since the lexicographer's"
7126,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"day, many of what used to be called his 'superstitions' have been"
7127,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"established as certain facts, although their explanation is still"
7128,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,shrouded in darkness. Roscommon was then only ten years of age.
7129,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
7130,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"From Caen he travelled to Italy, where he obtained a profound knowledge"
7131,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"of medals. At the Restoration he returned to England, where he was made"
7132,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Captain of the Band of Pensioners, and subsequently Master of the Horse"
7133,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"to the Duchess of York. He became unfortunately addicted to gambling,"
7134,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"and, through this miserable habit, he got embroiled in endless quarrels,"
7135,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,as well as in pecuniary embarassments.
7136,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
7137,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Business compelled him to visit Ireland, where the Duke of Orrnond made"
7138,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"him Captain of the Guards. On his return to England in 1662, he married"
7139,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"the Lady Frances, daughter of the Earl of Burlington. By her he had no"
7140,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"issue. His second wife, whom he married in 1674, was Isabella, daughter"
7141,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"of Matthew Beynton of Barmister, in Yorkshire."
7142,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
7143,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,Roscommon now began to meditate and execute literary projects. He
7144,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"produced an 'Essay on Translated Verse,' (in 1681,) a translation of"
7145,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Horace's 'Art of Poetry,' and other pieces. He projected, in conjunction"
7146,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"with his friend Dryden, a plan for refining our language and fixing its"
7147,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"standard, as if Time were not the great refiner, fixer, and enricher of"
7148,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"a tongue. While busy with these schemes and occupations, the troubles of"
7149,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"James II.'s reign commenced. Roscommon determined to retire to Rome,"
7150,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"saying, 'It is best to sit near the chimney when the chamber smokes.'"
7151,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Death, however, prevented him from reaching the beloved and desired"
7152,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"focus of Roman Catholic darkness. He was assailed by gout, and an"
7153,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"ignorant French empiric, whom he consulted, contrived to drive the"
7154,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"disease into the bowels. Roscommon expired, uttering with great fervour"
7155,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"two lines from his own translation of the 'Dies Irae,'--"
7156,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
7157,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"'My God, my Father, and my Friend,"
7158,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,Do not forsake me in my end.'
7159,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,
7160,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,This was in 1684. He received a pompous interment in Westminster Abbey.

7165,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,brilliant production. In one point he went before his age. He praises
7166,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,"Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' although unfortunately he selects for encomium"
7167,THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON.,the passage in the sixth book describing the angels fighting against

7397,CHARLES COTTON.,"Hearty, careless 'Charley Cotton' was born in 1630. His father, Sir"
7398,CHARLES COTTON.,"George Cotton, was improvident and intemperate in his latter days, and"
7399,CHARLES COTTON.,"left the poet an encumbered estate situated at Ashbourne, in Derbyshire,"
7400,CHARLES COTTON.,near the river Dove. This place will recall the words quoted by O'Connell
7401,CHARLES COTTON.,in Parliament in reference to the present Lord Derby:--
7402,CHARLES COTTON.,
7403,CHARLES COTTON.,"'Down thy fair banks, romantic Ashbourne, glides"
7404,CHARLES COTTON.,"The Derby dilly, with its six insides.'"
7405,CHARLES COTTON.,
7406,CHARLES COTTON.,"Charles studied at Cambridge; and after travelling abroad, married the"
7407,CHARLES COTTON.,"daughter of Sir Thomas Owthorp in Nottinghamshire, who does not appear"
7408,CHARLES COTTON.,"to have lived long. His extravagance keeping him poor, he was compelled"
7409,CHARLES COTTON.,"to eke out his means by translating works from the French and Italian,"
7410,CHARLES COTTON.,including those of a spirit somewhat kindred to his own--Montaigne. At
7411,CHARLES COTTON.,"the age of forty, he obtained a captain's commission in the army, and"
7412,CHARLES COTTON.,"went to Ireland. There he met with his second wife, Mary, Countess"
7413,CHARLES COTTON.,"Dowager of Ardglass, the widow of Lord Cornwall. She possessed a"
7414,CHARLES COTTON.,"jointure of £1500 a-year, secured, however, after marriage, from her"
7415,CHARLES COTTON.,husband's imprudent and reckless management. He returned to his English
7416,CHARLES COTTON.,"estate, where he became passionately fond of fishing,--intimate with"
7417,CHARLES COTTON.,"Izaak Walton, whom he invited in a poem, although now eighty-three years"
7418,CHARLES COTTON.,"old, to visit him in the country--and where he built a fishing-house,"
7419,CHARLES COTTON.,with the initials of Izaak's name and his own united in ciphers over
7420,CHARLES COTTON.,"the door; the walls, too, being painted with fishing scenes, and the"
7421,CHARLES COTTON.,portraits of Cotton and Walton appearing upon the beaufet. Poor Charles
7422,CHARLES COTTON.,"had a less fortunate career than his friend, dying insolvent at"
7423,CHARLES COTTON.,Westminster in 1687.
7424,CHARLES COTTON.,
7425,CHARLES COTTON.,"Careless gaiety and reckless extravagance, blended with heart, sense,"
7426,CHARLES COTTON.,"and sincerity, were the characteristics of Cotton as a man, and were, as"
7427,CHARLES COTTON.,"is usually the case, transferred to his poetry. He squandered his pence"
7428,CHARLES COTTON.,and his powers with equal profusion. His travestie of the 'Aeneid' is
7429,CHARLES COTTON.,"pronounced by Christopher North (who must have read it, however,) a"
7430,CHARLES COTTON.,"beastly book. Campbell says, with striking justice, of another of"
7431,CHARLES COTTON.,"Cotton's productions, 'His imitations of Lucian betray the grossest"
7432,CHARLES COTTON.,"misconception of humorous effect, when he attempts to burlesque that"
7433,CHARLES COTTON.,which is ludicrous already.' It is like trying to turn the 'Tale of
7434,CHARLES COTTON.,"a Tub' into ridicule. But Cotton's own vein, as exhibited in his"
7435,CHARLES COTTON.,"'Invitation to Walton,' his 'New Year,' and his 'Voyage to Ireland,'"
7436,CHARLES COTTON.,(which anticipates in some measure the style of Anstey in the 'New Bath
7437,CHARLES COTTON.,"Guide,') is very rich and varied, full of ease, picturesque spirit, and"
7438,CHARLES COTTON.,"humour, and stamps him a genuine, if not a great poet."

7524,CANTO I.,I know then you'll presently ask me for what?
7525,CANTO I.,"Why, faith, it was that makes the old woman trot;"
7526,CANTO I.,And therefore I think I'm not much to be blamed
7527,CANTO I.,If I went to the place whereof Nick was ashamed.
7528,CANTO I.,
7529,CANTO I.,"O Coryate! thou traveller famed as Ulysses,"
7530,CANTO I.,"In such a stupendous labour as this is,"
7531,CANTO I.,"Come lend me the aids of thy hands and thy feet,"
7532,CANTO I.,"Though the first be pedantic, the other not sweet,"
7533,CANTO I.,"Yet both are so restless in peregrination,"
7534,CANTO I.,"They'll help both my journey, and eke my relation."
7535,CANTO I.,
7536,CANTO I.,"'Twas now the most beautiful time of the year,"
7537,CANTO I.,"The days were now long, and the sky was now clear,"
7538,CANTO I.,"And May, that fair lady of splendid renown,"
7539,CANTO I.,"Had dressed herself fine, in her flowered tabby gown,"
7540,CANTO I.,"When about some two hours and an half after noon,"
7541,CANTO I.,"When it grew something late, though I thought it too soon,"
7542,CANTO I.,"With a pitiful voice, and a most heavy heart,"
7543,CANTO I.,I tuned up my pipes to sing _'loth to depart;_'
7544,CANTO I.,"The ditty concluded, I called for my horse,"
7545,CANTO I.,"And with a good pack did the jument endorse,"
7546,CANTO I.,"Till he groaned and he f----d under the burden,"
7547,CANTO I.,For sorrow had made me a cumbersome lurden:
7548,CANTO I.,"And now farewell, Dove, where I've caught such brave dishes"
7549,CANTO I.,"Of over-grown, golden, and silver-scaled fishes;"
7550,CANTO I.,"Thy trout and thy grayling may now feed securely,"
7551,CANTO I.,I've left none behind me can take 'em so surely;
7552,CANTO I.,"Feed on then, and breed on, until the next year,"
7553,CANTO I.,But if I return I expect my arrear.
7554,CANTO I.,
7555,CANTO I.,"By pacing and trotting betimes in the even,"
7556,CANTO I.,"Ere the sun had forsaken one half of the heaven,"
7557,CANTO I.,"We all at fair Congerton took up our inn,"
7558,CANTO I.,Where the sign of a king kept a King and his queen:
7559,CANTO I.,But who do you think came to welcome me there'?
7560,CANTO I.,"No worse a man, marry, than good master mayor,"
7561,CANTO I.,"With his staff of command, yet the man was not lame,"
7562,CANTO I.,"But he needed it more when he went, than he came;"
7563,CANTO I.,"After three or four hours of friendly potation,"
7564,CANTO I.,"We took leave each of other in courteous fashion,"
7565,CANTO I.,"When each one, to keep his brains fast in his head,"
7566,CANTO I.,"Put on a good nightcap, and straightway to bed."
7567,CANTO I.,
7568,CANTO I.,"Next morn, having paid for boiled, roasted, and bacon,"
7569,CANTO I.,"And of sovereign hostess our leaves kindly taken,"
7570,CANTO I.,"(For her king, as 'twas rumoured, by late pouring down,"
7571,CANTO I.,"This morning had got a foul flaw in his crown,)"
7572,CANTO I.,"We mounted again, and full soberly riding,"
7573,CANTO I.,Three miles we had rid ere we met with a biding;
7574,CANTO I.,"But there, having over-night plied the tap well,"
7575,CANTO I.,We now must needs water at a place called Holmes Chapel:
7576,CANTO I.,"'A hay!' quoth the foremost, 'ho! who keeps the house?'"
7577,CANTO I.,"Which said, out an host comes as brisk as a louse;"
7578,CANTO I.,"His hair combed as sleek as a barber he'd been,"
7579,CANTO I.,A cravat with black ribbon tied under his chin;
7580,CANTO I.,"Though by what I saw in him, I straight 'gan to fear"
7581,CANTO I.,That knot would be one day slipped under his ear.
7582,CANTO I.,"Quoth he (with low conge), 'What lack you, my lord?'"
7583,CANTO I.,"'The best liquor,' quoth I, 'that the house will afford.'"
7584,CANTO I.,"'You shall straight,' quoth he; and then calls out, 'Mary?"
7585,CANTO I.,"Come quickly, and bring us a quart of Canary.'"
7586,CANTO I.,"'Hold, hold, my spruce host! for i' th' morning so early,"
7587,CANTO I.,I never drink liquor but what's made of barley.'
7588,CANTO I.,"Which words were scarce out, but, which made me admire,"
7589,CANTO I.,My lordship was presently turned into 'squire:
7590,CANTO I.,
7591,CANTO I.,"'Ale, 'squire, you mean?' quoth he nimbly again,"
7592,CANTO I.,"'What, must it be purled'--'No, I love it best plain.'"
7593,CANTO I.,"'Why, if you'll drink ale, sir, pray take my advice,"
7594,CANTO I.,"Here's the best ale i' th' land, if you'll go to the price;"
7595,CANTO I.,"Better, I sure am, ne'er blew out a stopple;"
7596,CANTO I.,"But then, in plain truth, it is sixpence a bottle.'"
7597,CANTO I.,"'Why, faith,' quoth I, 'friend, if your liquor be such,"
7598,CANTO I.,"For the best ale in England, it is not too much:"
7599,CANTO I.,"Let's have it, and quickly.'--'o sir! you may stay;"
7600,CANTO I.,A pot in your pate is a mile in your way:
7601,CANTO I.,"Come, bring out a bottle here presently, wife,"
7602,CANTO I.,Of the best Cheshire hum he e'er drank in his life.'
7603,CANTO I.,"Straight out comes the mistress in waistcoat of silk,"
7604,CANTO I.,"As clear as a milkmaid, as white as her milk,"
7605,CANTO I.,"With visage as oval and sleek as an egg,"
7606,CANTO I.,"As straight as an arrow, as right as my leg:"
7607,CANTO I.,"A curtsey she made, as demure as a sister,"
7608,CANTO I.,"I could not forbear, but alighted and kissed her:"
7609,CANTO I.,"Then ducking another, with most modest mien,"
7610,CANTO I.,"The first word she said was, 'Will 't please you walk in?"
7611,CANTO I.,"I thanked her; but told her, I then could not stay,"
7612,CANTO I.,For the haste of my business did call me away.
7613,CANTO I.,"She said, she was sorry it fell out so odd,"
7614,CANTO I.,"But if, when again I should travel that road,"
7615,CANTO I.,"I would stay there a night, she assured me the nation"
7616,CANTO I.,Should nowhere afford better accommodation:
7617,CANTO I.,"Meanwhile my spruce landlord has broken the cork,"
7618,CANTO I.,"And called for a bodkin, though he had a fork;"
7619,CANTO I.,"But I showed him a screw, which I told my brisk gull"
7620,CANTO I.,A trepan was for bottles had broken their skull;
7621,CANTO I.,"Which, as it was true, he believed without doubt,"
7622,CANTO I.,"But 'twas I that applied it, and pulled the cork out."
7623,CANTO I.,"Bounce, quoth the bottle, the work being done,"
7624,CANTO I.,"It roared, and it smoked, like a new-fired gun;"
7625,CANTO I.,"But the shot missed us all, or else we'd been routed,"
7626,CANTO I.,"Which yet was a wonder, we were so about it."
7627,CANTO I.,"Mine host poured and filled, till he could fill no fuller:"
7628,CANTO I.,"'Look here, sir,' quoth he, 'both for nap and for colour,"
7629,CANTO I.,"Sans bragging, I hate it, nor will I e'er do 't;"
7630,CANTO I.,"I defy Leek, and Lambhith, and Sandwich, to boot.'"
7631,CANTO I.,"By my troth, he said true, for I speak it with tears,"
7632,CANTO I.,"Though I have been a toss-pot these twenty good years,"
7633,CANTO I.,"And have drank so much liquor has made me a debtor,"
7634,CANTO I.,"In my days, that I know of, I never drank better:"
7635,CANTO I.,"We found it so good and we drank so profoundly,"
7636,CANTO I.,That four good round shillings were whipt away roundly;
7637,CANTO I.,"And then I conceived it was time to be jogging,"
7638,CANTO I.,"For our work had been done, had we stay'd t' other noggin."
7639,CANTO I.,
7640,CANTO I.,"From thence we set forth with more metal and spright,"
7641,CANTO I.,"Our horses were empty, our coxcombs were light;"
7642,CANTO I.,"O'er Dellamore forest we, tantivy, posted,"
7643,CANTO I.,Till our horses were basted as if they were roasted:
7644,CANTO I.,"In truth, we pursued might have been by our haste,"
7645,CANTO I.,"And I think Sir George Booth did not gallop so fast,"
7646,CANTO I.,"Till about two o'clock after noon, God be blest,"
7647,CANTO I.,"We came, safe and sound, all to Chester i' th' west."
7648,CANTO I.,
7649,CANTO I.,"And now in high time 'twas to call for some meat,"
7650,CANTO I.,"Though drinking does well, yet some time we must eat:"
7651,CANTO I.,"And i' faith we had victuals both plenty and good,"
7652,CANTO I.,Where we all laid about us as if we were wood:
7653,CANTO I.,"Go thy ways, Mistress Anderton, for a good woman,"
7654,CANTO I.,Thy guests shall by thee ne'er be turned to a common;
7655,CANTO I.,"And whoever of thy entertainment complains,"
7656,CANTO I.,"Let him lie with a drab, and be poxed for his pains."
7657,CANTO I.,
7658,CANTO I.,"And here I must stop the career of my Muse,"
7659,CANTO I.,"The poor jade is weary, 'las! how should she choose?"
7660,CANTO I.,"And if I should further here spur on my course,"
7661,CANTO I.,"I should, questionless, tire both my wits and my horse:"
7662,CANTO I.,"To-night let us rest, for 'tis good Sunday's even,"
7663,CANTO I.,"To-morrow to church, and ask pardon of Heaven."
7664,CANTO I.,"Thus far we our time spent, as here I have penned it,"
7665,CANTO I.,"An odd kind of life, and 'tis well if we mend it:"
7666,CANTO I.,"But to-morrow (God willing) we'll have t' other bout,"
7667,CANTO I.,"And better or worse be 't, for murder will out,"
7668,CANTO I.,"Our future adventures we'll lay down before ye,"
7669,CANTO I.,For my Muse is deep sworn to use truth of the story.
7670,CANTO I.,
7671,CANTO I.,
7672,CANTO II,CANTO II
7673,CANTO II,
7674,CANTO II,"After seven hours' sleep, to commute for pains taken,"
7675,CANTO II,"A man of himself, one would think, might awaken;"
7676,CANTO II,"But riding, and drinking hard, were two such spells,"
7677,CANTO II,"I doubt I'd slept on, but for jangling of bells,"
7678,CANTO II,"Which, ringing to matins all over the town,"
7679,CANTO II,"Made me leap out of bed, and put on my gown."
7680,CANTO II,"With intent (so God mend me) t' have gone to the choir,"
7681,CANTO II,When straight I perceived myself all on a fire;
7682,CANTO II,"For the two forenamed things had so heated my blood,"
7683,CANTO II,That a little phlebotomy would do me good:
7684,CANTO II,"I sent for chirurgeon, who came in a trice,"
7685,CANTO II,"And swift to shed blood, needed not be called twice,"
7686,CANTO II,"But tilted stiletto quite thorough the vein,"
7687,CANTO II,From whence issued out the ill humours amain;
7688,CANTO II,"When having twelve ounces, he bound up my arm,"
7689,CANTO II,"And I gave him two Georges, which did him no harm:"
7690,CANTO II,"But after my bleeding, I soon understood"
7691,CANTO II,It had cooled my devotion as well as my blood;
7692,CANTO II,"For I had no more mind to look on my psalter,"
7693,CANTO II,Than (saving your presence) I had to a halter;
7694,CANTO II,"But, like a most wicked and obstinate sinner,"
7695,CANTO II,Then sat in my chamber till folks came to dinner:
7696,CANTO II,"I dined with good stomach, and very good cheer,"
7697,CANTO II,"With a very fine woman, and good ale and beer;"
7698,CANTO II,"When myself having stuffed than a bagpipe more full,"
7699,CANTO II,I fell to my smoking until I grew dull;
7700,CANTO II,"And, therefore, to take a fine nap thought it best,"
7701,CANTO II,"For when belly full is, bones would be at rest:"
7702,CANTO II,"I tumbled me down on my bed like a swad,"
7703,CANTO II,"Where, oh! the delicious dream that I had!"
7704,CANTO II,"Till the bells, that had been my morning molesters,"
7705,CANTO II,"Now waked me again, chiming all in to vespers:"
7706,CANTO II,"With that starting up, for my man I did whistle,"
7707,CANTO II,And combed out and powdered my locks that were grizzle;
7708,CANTO II,"Had my clothes neatly brushed, and then put on my sword,"
7709,CANTO II,Resolved now to go and attend on the word.
7710,CANTO II,
7711,CANTO II,"Thus tricked, and thus trim, to set forth I begin,"
7712,CANTO II,"Neat and cleanly without, but scarce cleanly within;"
7713,CANTO II,"For why, Heaven knows it, I long time had been"
7714,CANTO II,A most humble obedient servant to sin;
7715,CANTO II,"And now in devotion was even so proud,"
7716,CANTO II,I scorned forsooth to join prayer with the crowd;
7717,CANTO II,"For though courted by all the bells as I went,"
7718,CANTO II,"I was deaf, and regarded not the compliment,"
7719,CANTO II,"But to the cathedral still held on my pace,"
7720,CANTO II,"As't were, scorning to kneel but in the best place."
7721,CANTO II,"I there made myself sure of good music at least,"
7722,CANTO II,"But was something deceived, for 'twas none of the best:"
7723,CANTO II,But however I stay'd at the church's commanding
7724,CANTO II,"Till we came to the 'Peace passes all understanding,'"
7725,CANTO II,"Which no sooner was ended, but whir and away,"
7726,CANTO II,Like boys in a school when they've leave got to play;
7727,CANTO II,"All save master mayor, who still gravely stays"
7728,CANTO II,Till the rest had made room for his worship and's mace:
7729,CANTO II,"Then he and his brethren in order appear,"
7730,CANTO II,"I out of my stall, and fell into his rear;"
7731,CANTO II,"For why, 'tis much safer appearing, no doubt,"
7732,CANTO II,"In authority's tail, than the head of a rout."
7733,CANTO II,
7734,CANTO II,In this rev'rend order we marched from prayer;
7735,CANTO II,The mace before me borne as well as the mayor;
7736,CANTO II,"Who looking behind him, and seeing most plain"
7737,CANTO II,"A glorious gold belt in the rear of his train,"
7738,CANTO II,"Made such a low congé, forgetting his place,"
7739,CANTO II,I was never so honoured before in my days:
7740,CANTO II,"But then off went my scalp-case, and down went my fist,"
7741,CANTO II,"Till the pavement, too hard, by my knuckles was kissed;"
7742,CANTO II,"By which, though thick-skulled, he must understand this,"
7743,CANTO II,That I was a most humble servant of his;
7744,CANTO II,"Which also so wonderful kindly he took,"
7745,CANTO II,"(As I well perceived both b' his gesture and look,)"
7746,CANTO II,"That to have me dogg'd home he straightway appointed,"
7747,CANTO II,"Resolving, it seems, to be better acquainted."
7748,CANTO II,"I was scarce in my quarters, and set down on crupper,"
7749,CANTO II,"But his man was there too, to invite me to supper:"
7750,CANTO II,"I start up, and after most respective fashion"
7751,CANTO II,Gave his worship much thanks for his kind invitation;
7752,CANTO II,"But begged his excuse, for my stomach was small,"
7753,CANTO II,And I never did eat any supper at all;
7754,CANTO II,"But that after supper I would kiss his hands,"
7755,CANTO II,And would come to receive his worship's commands.
7756,CANTO II,"Sure no one will say, but a patron of slander,"
7757,CANTO II,That this was not pretty well for a Moorlander:
7758,CANTO II,"And since on such reasons to sup I refused,"
7759,CANTO II,I nothing did doubt to be holden excused;
7760,CANTO II,But my quaint repartee had his worship possess'd
7761,CANTO II,"With so wonderful good a conceit of the rest,"
7762,CANTO II,That with mere impatience he hoped in his breeches
7763,CANTO II,To see the fine fellow that made such fine speeches:
7764,CANTO II,"'Go, sirrah!' quoth he, 'get you to him again,"
7765,CANTO II,"And will and require, in his Majesty's name,"
7766,CANTO II,"That he come; and tell him, obey he were best, or"
7767,CANTO II,I'll teach him to know that he's now in West-Chester.'
7768,CANTO II,"The man, upon this, comes me running again,"
7769,CANTO II,"But yet minced his message, and was not so plain;"
7770,CANTO II,"Saying to me only, 'Good sir, I am sorry"
7771,CANTO II,To tell you my master has sent again for you;
7772,CANTO II,"And has such a longing to have you his guest,"
7773,CANTO II,"That I, with these ears, heard him swear and protest,"
7774,CANTO II,"He would neither say grace, nor sit down on his bum,"
7775,CANTO II,"Nor open his napkin, until you do come.'"
7776,CANTO II,"With that I perceived no excuse would avail,"
7777,CANTO II,"And, seeing there was no defence for a flail,"
7778,CANTO II,"I said I was ready master may'r to obey,"
7779,CANTO II,And therefore desired him to lead me the way.
7780,CANTO II,"We went, and ere Malkin could well lick her ear,"
7781,CANTO II,"(For it but the next door was, forsooth) we were there;"
7782,CANTO II,"Where lights being brought me, I mounted the stairs,"
7783,CANTO II,The worst I e'er saw in my life at a mayor's:
7784,CANTO II,But everything else must be highly commended.
7785,CANTO II,"I there found his worship most nobly attended,"
7786,CANTO II,"Besides such a supper as well did convince,"
7787,CANTO II,A may'r in his province to be a great prince;
7788,CANTO II,"As he sat in his chair, he did not much vary,"
7789,CANTO II,"In state nor in face, from our eighth English Harry;"
7790,CANTO II,"But whether his face was swelled up with fat,"
7791,CANTO II,"Or puffed up with glory, I cannot tell that."
7792,CANTO II,"Being entered the chamber half length of a pike,"
7793,CANTO II,And cutting of faces exceedingly like
7794,CANTO II,"One of those little gentlemen brought from the Indies,"
7795,CANTO II,"And screwing myself into congés and cringes,"
7796,CANTO II,"By then I was half-way advanced in the room,"
7797,CANTO II,"His worship most rev'rendly rose from his bum,"
7798,CANTO II,"And with the more honour to grace and to greet me,"
7799,CANTO II,Advanced a whole step and a half for to meet me;
7800,CANTO II,"Where leisurely doffing a hat worth a tester,"
7801,CANTO II,He bade me most heartily welcome to Chester.
7802,CANTO II,"I thanked him in language the best I was able,"
7803,CANTO II,And so we forthwith sat us all down to table.
7804,CANTO II,
7805,CANTO II,"Now here you must note, and 'tis worth observation,"
7806,CANTO II,That as his chair at one end o' th' table had station;
7807,CANTO II,"So sweet mistress may'ress, in just such another,"
7808,CANTO II,"Like the fair queen of hearts, sat in state at the other;"
7809,CANTO II,"By which I perceived, though it seemed a riddle,"
7810,CANTO II,The lower end of this must be just in the middle:
7811,CANTO II,"But perhaps 'tis a rule there, and one that would mind it"
7812,CANTO II,Amongst the town-statutes 'tis likely might find it.
7813,CANTO II,"But now into the pottage each deep his spoon claps,"
7814,CANTO II,"As in truth one might safely for burning one's chaps,"
7815,CANTO II,"When straight, with the look and the tone of a scold,"
7816,CANTO II,Mistress may'ress complained that the pottage was cold;
7817,CANTO II,"'And all 'long of your fiddle-faddle,' quoth she."
7818,CANTO II,"'Why, what then, Goody Two-Shoes, what if it be?"
7819,CANTO II,"Hold you, if you can, your tittle-tattle,' quoth he."
7820,CANTO II,"I was glad she was snapped thus, and guessed by th' discourse,"
7821,CANTO II,"The may'r, not the gray mare, was the better horse,"
7822,CANTO II,"And yet for all that, there is reason to fear,"
7823,CANTO II,She submitted but out of respect to his year:
7824,CANTO II,"However 'twas well she had now so much grace,"
7825,CANTO II,"Though not to the man, to submit to his place;"
7826,CANTO II,"For had she proceeded, I verily thought"
7827,CANTO II,"My turn would the next be, for I was in fault:"
7828,CANTO II,"But this brush being past, we fell to our diet,"
7829,CANTO II,And every one there filled his belly in quiet.
7830,CANTO II,"Supper being ended, and things away taken,"
7831,CANTO II,Master mayor's curiosity 'gan to awaken;
7832,CANTO II,"Wherefore making me draw something nearer his chair,"
7833,CANTO II,He willed and required me there to declare
7834,CANTO II,"My country, my birth, my estate, and my parts,"
7835,CANTO II,And whether I was not a master of arts;
7836,CANTO II,"And eke what the business was had brought me thither,"
7837,CANTO II,"With what I was going about now, and whither:"
7838,CANTO II,"Giving me caution, no lie should escape me,"
7839,CANTO II,"For if I should trip, he should certainly trap me."
7840,CANTO II,"I answered, my country was famed Staffordshire;"
7841,CANTO II,"That in deeds, bills, and bonds, I was ever writ squire;"
7842,CANTO II,"That of land I had both sorts, some good, and some evil,"
7843,CANTO II,But that a great part on't was pawned to the devil;
7844,CANTO II,"That as for my parts, they were such as he saw;"
7845,CANTO II,"That, indeed, I had a small smatt'ring of law,"
7846,CANTO II,"Which I lately had got more by practice than reading,"
7847,CANTO II,"By sitting o' th' bench, whilst others were pleading;"
7848,CANTO II,"But that arms I had ever more studied than arts,"
7849,CANTO II,And was now to a captain raised by my deserts;
7850,CANTO II,That the business which led me through Palatine ground
7851,CANTO II,"Into Ireland was, whither now I was bound;"
7852,CANTO II,"Where his worship's great favour I loud will proclaim,"
7853,CANTO II,And in all other places wherever I came.
7854,CANTO II,"He said, as to that, I might do what I list,"
7855,CANTO II,"But that I was welcome, and gave me his fist;"
7856,CANTO II,"When having my fingers made crack with his gripes,"
7857,CANTO II,He called to his man for some bottles and pipes.
7858,CANTO II,
7859,CANTO II,To trouble you here with a longer narration
7860,CANTO II,"Of the several parts of our confabulation,"
7861,CANTO II,Perhaps would be tedious; I'll therefore remit ye
7862,CANTO II,"Even to the most rev'rend records of the city,"
7863,CANTO II,"Where, doubtless, the acts of the may'rs are recorded,"
7864,CANTO II,"And if not more truly, yet much better worded."
7865,CANTO II,
7866,CANTO II,"In short, then, we piped and we tippled Canary,"
7867,CANTO II,Till my watch pointed one in the circle horary;
7868,CANTO II,"When thinking it now was high time to depart,"
7869,CANTO II,His worship I thanked with a most grateful heart;
7870,CANTO II,"And because to great men presents are acceptable,"
7871,CANTO II,"I presented the may'r, ere I rose from the table,"
7872,CANTO II,With a certain fantastical box and a stopper;
7873,CANTO II,"And he having kindly accepted my offer,"

7878,CANTO III.,CANTO III.
7879,CANTO III.,
7880,CANTO III.,"The sun in the morning disclosed his light,"
7881,CANTO III.,With complexion as ruddy as mine over night;
7882,CANTO III.,"And o'er th' eastern mountains peeping up's head,"
7883,CANTO III.,"The casement being open, espied me in bed;"
7884,CANTO III.,"With his rays he so tickled my lids that I waked,"
7885,CANTO III.,"And was half ashamed, for I found myself naked;"
7886,CANTO III.,"But up I soon start, and was dressed in a trice,"
7887,CANTO III.,"And called for a draught of ale, sugar, and spice;"
7888,CANTO III.,"Which having turned off, I then call to pay,"
7889,CANTO III.,"And packing my nawls, whipt to horse, and away."
7890,CANTO III.,"A guide I had got, who demanded great vails,"
7891,CANTO III.,For conducting me over the mountains of Wales:
7892,CANTO III.,"Twenty good shillings, which sure very large is;"
7893,CANTO III.,"Yet that would not serve, but I must bear his charges;"
7894,CANTO III.,"And yet for all that, rode astride on a beast,"
7895,CANTO III.,"The worst that e'er went on three legs, I protest:"
7896,CANTO III.,"It certainly was the most ugly of jades,"
7897,CANTO III.,His hips and his rump made a right ace of spades;
7898,CANTO III.,"His sides were two ladders, well spur-galled withal;"
7899,CANTO III.,"His neck was a helve, and his head was a mall;"
7900,CANTO III.,"For his colour, my pains and your trouble I'll spare,"
7901,CANTO III.,For the creature was wholly denuded of hair;
7902,CANTO III.,"And, except for two things, as bare as my nail,"
7903,CANTO III.,"A tuft of a mane, and a sprig of a tail;"
7904,CANTO III.,"And by these the true colour one can no more know,"
7905,CANTO III.,"Than by mouse-skins above stairs, the merkin below."
7906,CANTO III.,"Now such as the beast was, even such was the rider,"
7907,CANTO III.,"With a head like a nutmeg, and legs like a spider;"
7908,CANTO III.,"A voice like a cricket, a look like a rat,"
7909,CANTO III.,"The brains of a goose, and the heart of a cat:"
7910,CANTO III.,"Even such was my guide and his beast; let them pass,"
7911,CANTO III.,"The one for a horse, and the other an ass."
7912,CANTO III.,"But now with our horses, what sound and what rotten,"
7913,CANTO III.,"Down to the shore, you must know, we were gotten;"
7914,CANTO III.,"And there we were told, it concerned us to ride,"
7915,CANTO III.,Unless we did mean to encounter the tide;
7916,CANTO III.,"And then my guide lab'ring with heels and with hands,"
7917,CANTO III.,"With two up and one down, hopped over the sands,"
7918,CANTO III.,"Till his horse, finding the labour for three legs too sore,"
7919,CANTO III.,"Foaled out a new leg, and then he had four:"
7920,CANTO III.,"And now by plain dint of hard spurring and whipping,"
7921,CANTO III.,Dry-shod we came where folks sometimes take shipping;
7922,CANTO III.,"And where the salt sea, as the devil were in 't,"
7923,CANTO III.,Came roaring t' have hindered our journey to Flint;
7924,CANTO III.,"But we, by good luck, before him got thither,"
7925,CANTO III.,"He else would have carried us, no man knows whither."
7926,CANTO III.,
7927,CANTO III.,"And now her in Wales is, Saint Taph be her speed,"
7928,CANTO III.,"Gott splutter her taste, some Welsh ale her had need;"
7929,CANTO III.,"For her ride in great haste, and    *     *"
7930,CANTO III.,For fear of her being catched up by the fishes:
7931,CANTO III.,"But the lord of Flint castle's no lord worth a louse,"
7932,CANTO III.,For he keeps ne'er a drop of good drink in his house;
7933,CANTO III.,But in a small house near unto 't there was store
7934,CANTO III.,"Of such ale as, thank God, I ne'er tasted before;"
7935,CANTO III.,"And surely the Welsh are not wise of their fuddle,"
7936,CANTO III.,For this had the taste and complexion of puddle.
7937,CANTO III.,"From thence then we marched, full as dry as we came,"
7938,CANTO III.,"My guide before prancing, his steed no more lame,"
7939,CANTO III.,"O'er hills and o'er valleys uncouth and uneven,"
7940,CANTO III.,"Until 'twixt the hours of twelve and eleven,"
7941,CANTO III.,"More hungry and thirsty than tongue can well tell,"
7942,CANTO III.,We happily came to Saint Winifred's well:
7943,CANTO III.,"I thought it the pool of Bethesda had been,"
7944,CANTO III.,By the cripples lay there; but I went to my inn
7945,CANTO III.,"To speak for some meat, for so stomach did motion,"
7946,CANTO III.,Before I did further proceed in devotion:
7947,CANTO III.,"I went into th' kitchen, where victuals I saw,"
7948,CANTO III.,"Both beef, veal, and mutton, but all on 't was raw;"
7949,CANTO III.,"And some on't alive, but soon went to slaughter,"
7950,CANTO III.,For four chickens were slain by my dame and her daughter;
7951,CANTO III.,"Of which to Saint Win. ere my vows I had paid,"
7952,CANTO III.,They said I should find a rare fricasée made:
7953,CANTO III.,"I thanked them, and straight to the well did repair,"
7954,CANTO III.,"Where some I found cursing, and others at prayer;"
7955,CANTO III.,"Some dressing, some stripping, some out and some in,"
7956,CANTO III.,"Some naked, where botches and boils might be seen;"
7957,CANTO III.,"Of which some were fevers of Venus I'm sure,"
7958,CANTO III.,And therefore unfit for the virgin to cure:
7959,CANTO III.,"But the fountain, in truth, is well worth the sight,"
7960,CANTO III.,The beautiful virgin's own tears not more bright;
7961,CANTO III.,"Nay, none but she ever shed such a tear,"
7962,CANTO III.,"Her conscience, her name, nor herself, were more clear."
7963,CANTO III.,"In the bottom there lie certain stones that look white,"
7964,CANTO III.,"But streaked with pure red, as the morning with light,"
7965,CANTO III.,"Which they say is her blood, and so it may be,"
7966,CANTO III.,"But for that, let who shed it look to it for me."
7967,CANTO III.,"Over the fountain a chapel there stands,"
7968,CANTO III.,Which I wonder has 'scaped master Oliver's hands;
7969,CANTO III.,"The floor's not ill paved, and the margin o' th' spring"
7970,CANTO III.,Is inclosed with a certain octagonal ring;
7971,CANTO III.,"From each angle of which a pillar does rise,"
7972,CANTO III.,Of strength and of thickness enough to suffice
7973,CANTO III.,To support and uphold from falling to ground
7974,CANTO III.,A cupola wherewith the virgin is crowned.
7975,CANTO III.,"Now 'twixt the two angles that fork to the north,"
7976,CANTO III.,"And where the cold nymph does her basin pour forth,"
7977,CANTO III.,"Under ground is a place where they bathe, as 'tis said,"
7978,CANTO III.,"And 'tis true, for I heard folks' teeth hack in their head;"
7979,CANTO III.,"For you are to know, that the rogues and the * *"
7980,CANTO III.,Are not let to pollute the spring-head with their sores.
7981,CANTO III.,"But one thing I chiefly admired in the place,"
7982,CANTO III.,"That a saint and a virgin endued with such grace,"
7983,CANTO III.,Should yet be so wonderful kind a well-willer
7984,CANTO III.,"To that whoring and filching trade of a miller,"
7985,CANTO III.,As within a few paces to furnish the wheels
7986,CANTO III.,Of I cannot tell how many water-mills:
7987,CANTO III.,"I've studied that point much, you cannot guess why,"
7988,CANTO III.,"But the virgin was, doubtless, more righteous than I."
7989,CANTO III.,"And now for my welcome, four, five, or six lasses,"
7990,CANTO III.,"With as many crystalline liberal glasses,"
7991,CANTO III.,Did all importune me to drink of the water
7992,CANTO III.,"Of Saint Winifreda, good Thewith's fair daughter."
7993,CANTO III.,"A while I was doubtful, and stood in a muse,"
7994,CANTO III.,"Not knowing, amidst all that choice, where to choose."
7995,CANTO III.,"Till a pair of black eyes, darting full in my sight,"
7996,CANTO III.,From the rest o' th' fair maidens did carry me quite;
7997,CANTO III.,"I took the glass from her, and whip, off it went,"
7998,CANTO III.,I half doubt I fancied a health to the saint:
7999,CANTO III.,"But he was a great villain committed the slaughter,"
8000,CANTO III.,For Saint Winifred made most delicate water.
8001,CANTO III.,"I slipped a hard shilling into her soft hand,"
8002,CANTO III.,Which had like to have made me the place have profaned;
8003,CANTO III.,"And giving two more to the poor that were there,"
8004,CANTO III.,"Did, sharp as a hawk, to my quarters repair."
8005,CANTO III.,
8006,CANTO III.,"My dinner was ready, and to it I fell,"
8007,CANTO III.,"I never ate better meat, that I can tell;"
8008,CANTO III.,"When having half dined, there comes in my host,"
8009,CANTO III.,"A catholic good, and a rare drunken toast;"
8010,CANTO III.,"This man, by his drinking, inflamed the scot,"
8011,CANTO III.,"And told me strange stories, which I have forgot;"
8012,CANTO III.,"But this I remember, 'twas much on's own life,"
8013,CANTO III.,"And one thing, that he had converted his wife."
8014,CANTO III.,
8015,CANTO III.,"But now my guide told me, it time was to go,"
8016,CANTO III.,For that to our beds we must both ride and row;
8017,CANTO III.,"Wherefore calling to pay, and having accounted,"
8018,CANTO III.,"I soon was down-stairs, and as suddenly mounted:"
8019,CANTO III.,"On then we travelled, our guide still before,"
8020,CANTO III.,"Sometimes on three legs, and sometimes on four,"
8021,CANTO III.,"Coasting the sea, and over hills crawling,"
8022,CANTO III.,"Sometimes on all four, for fear we should fall in;"
8023,CANTO III.,"For underneath Neptune lay skulking to watch us,"
8024,CANTO III.,"And, had we but slipped once, was ready to catch us."
8025,CANTO III.,"Thus in places of danger taking more heed,"
8026,CANTO III.,And in safer travelling mending our speed:
8027,CANTO III.,"Redland Castle and Abergoney we past,"
8028,CANTO III.,And o'er against Connoway came at the last:
8029,CANTO III.,"Just over against a castle there stood,"
8030,CANTO III.,"O' th' right hand the town, and o' th' left hand a wood;"
8031,CANTO III.,'Twixt the wood and the castle they see at high water
8032,CANTO III.,"The storm, the place makes it a dangerous matter;"
8033,CANTO III.,"And besides, upon such a steep rock it is founded,"
8034,CANTO III.,"As would break a man's neck, should he'scape being drowned:"
8035,CANTO III.,"Perhaps though in time one may make them to yield,"
8036,CANTO III.,But 'tis prettiest Cob-castle e'er I beheld.
8037,CANTO III.,
8038,CANTO III.,"The sun now was going t' unharness his steeds,"
8039,CANTO III.,"When the ferry-boat brasking her sides 'gainst the weeds,"
8040,CANTO III.,"Came in as good time as good time could be,"
8041,CANTO III.,To give us a cast o'er an arm of the sea;
8042,CANTO III.,"And bestowing our horses before and abaft,"
8043,CANTO III.,O'er god Neptune's wide cod-piece gave us a waft;
8044,CANTO III.,"Where scurvily landing at foot of the fort,"
8045,CANTO III.,"Within very few paces we entered the port,"
8046,CANTO III.,"Where another King's Head invited me down,"
8047,CANTO III.,For indeed I have ever been true to the crown.

8052,DR HENRY MORE.,DR HENRY MORE.
8053,DR HENRY MORE.,
8054,DR HENRY MORE.,
8055,DR HENRY MORE.,This eminent man was the son of a gentleman of good family and estate
8056,DR HENRY MORE.,"in Grantham, Lincolnshire. He was born in 1614. His father sent him to"
8057,DR HENRY MORE.,"study at Eton, and thence, in 1631, he repaired to Cambridge, where he"
8058,DR HENRY MORE.,was destined to spend the most of his life. Philosophy attracted him
8059,DR HENRY MORE.,"early, in preference to science or literature, and he became a follower"
8060,DR HENRY MORE.,"of Plato, so decided and enthusiastic as to gain for himself the title"
8061,DR HENRY MORE.,"of 'The Platonist' _par excellence_. In 1639, he graduated M.A.; and the"
8062,DR HENRY MORE.,"next year, he published the first part of 'Psychozoia; or, The Song of"
8063,DR HENRY MORE.,"the Soul,' containing a Christiano-Platonical account of Man and Life."
8064,DR HENRY MORE.,"In preparing the materials of this poem, he had studied all the"
8065,DR HENRY MORE.,"principal Platonists and mystical writers, and is said to have read"
8066,DR HENRY MORE.,"himself almost to a shadow. And not only was his body emaciated, but"
8067,DR HENRY MORE.,"his mind was so overstrung, that he imagined himself to see spiritual"
8068,DR HENRY MORE.,"beings, to hear supernatural voices, and to converse, like Socrates,"
8069,DR HENRY MORE.,"with a particular genius. He thought, too, that his body 'exhaled the"
8070,DR HENRY MORE.,"perfume of violets!' Notwithstanding these little peculiarities, his"
8071,DR HENRY MORE.,"genius and his learning, the simplicity of his character, and the"
8072,DR HENRY MORE.,"innocence of his life, rendered him a general favourite; he was made"
8073,DR HENRY MORE.,"a fellow of his college, and became a tutor to various persons of"
8074,DR HENRY MORE.,"distinguished rank. One of these was Sir John Finch, whose sister, Lady"
8075,DR HENRY MORE.,"Conway, an enthusiast herself, brought More acquainted with the famous"
8076,DR HENRY MORE.,"John Baptist Van Helment, a man after whom, in the beginning of the"
8077,DR HENRY MORE.,"seventeenth century, the whole of Europe wondered. He was a follower and"
8078,DR HENRY MORE.,"imitator of Paracelsus, like him affected universal knowledge, aspired"
8079,DR HENRY MORE.,"to revolutionise the science of medicine, and died with the reputation"
8080,DR HENRY MORE.,"of one who, with great powers and acquirements, instead of becoming a"
8081,DR HENRY MORE.,"great man, ended as a brilliant pretender, and was rather an 'architect"
8082,DR HENRY MORE.,"of ruin' to the systems of others, than the founder of a solid fabric of"
8083,DR HENRY MORE.,"his own. More admired, of course, not the quackery, but the adventurous"
8084,DR HENRY MORE.,"boldness of Helment's genius, and his devotion to chemistry; which is"
8085,DR HENRY MORE.,"certainly the most spiritual of all the sciences, and must, especially"
8086,DR HENRY MORE.,"in its transcendental forms, have had a great charm for a Platonic"
8087,DR HENRY MORE.,"thinker. Our author was entirely devoted to study, and resisted every"
8088,DR HENRY MORE.,inducement to leave what he called his 'Paradise' at Cambridge. His
8089,DR HENRY MORE.,"friends once tried to decoy him into a bishopric, and got him the length"
8090,DR HENRY MORE.,of Whitehall to kiss the king's hand on the occasion; but when he
8091,DR HENRY MORE.,"understood their purpose, he refused to go a single step further. His"
8092,DR HENRY MORE.,"life was a long, learned, happy, and holy dream. He was of the most"
8093,DR HENRY MORE.,"benevolent disposition; and once observed to a friend, 'that he was"
8094,DR HENRY MORE.,"thought by some to have a soft head, but he thanked God he had a soft"
8095,DR HENRY MORE.,"heart.' In the heat of the Rebellion, the Republicans spared More,"
8096,DR HENRY MORE.,"although he had refused to take the Covenant. Campbell says of him,"
8097,DR HENRY MORE.,"'He corresponded with Descartes, was the friend of Cudworth, and, as a"
8098,DR HENRY MORE.,"divine and a moralist, was not only popular in his own time, but has"
8099,DR HENRY MORE.,been mentioned with admiration both by Addison and Blair.' One is rather
8100,DR HENRY MORE.,"amused at the latter clause. That a man of More's massive learning,"
8101,DR HENRY MORE.,"noble eloquence, and divine genius should need the testimony of a mere"
8102,DR HENRY MORE.,"elegant wordmonger like Blair, seems ludicrous enough; and Addison"
8103,DR HENRY MORE.,"himself, except in wit and humour, was not worthy to have untied the"
8104,DR HENRY MORE.,shoelatchets of the old Platonist. We were first introduced to this
8105,DR HENRY MORE.,"writer by good Dr John Brown, late of Broughton Place, Edinburgh, and"
8106,DR HENRY MORE.,"shall never forget hearing him, in his library, read some splendid"
8107,DR HENRY MORE.,"passages from More's work, in those deep, mellow, antique tones which"
8108,DR HENRY MORE.,"flavoured whatever he read, like the crust on old wine. His chief works"
8109,DR HENRY MORE.,"are, 'A Discourse on the Immortality of the Soul,' 'The Mystery of"
8110,DR HENRY MORE.,"Godliness,' 'The Mystery of Iniquity,' 'Divine Dialogues,' 'An Antidote"
8111,DR HENRY MORE.,"against Atheism,' 'Ethical and Metaphysical Manuals,' &c. In writing"
8112,DR HENRY MORE.,"such books, and pursuing the recondite studies of which they were the"
8113,DR HENRY MORE.,"fruit, More spent his life happily. In 1661, he became a Fellow of"
8114,DR HENRY MORE.,"the Royal Society. For twenty years after the Restoration, his works"
8115,DR HENRY MORE.,are said to have sold better than any of their day--a curious and
8116,DR HENRY MORE.,"unaccountable fact, considering the levity and licentiousness of the"
8117,DR HENRY MORE.,"period. In September 1687, the fine old spiritualist, aged seventy-"
8118,DR HENRY MORE.,"three, went away to that land of 'ideas' to which his heart had been"
8119,DR HENRY MORE.,translated long before.
8120,DR HENRY MORE.,
8121,DR HENRY MORE.,"More's prose writings give us, on the whole, a higher idea of his powers"
8122,DR HENRY MORE.,"than his poem. This is not exactly, as a recent critic calls it, 'dull"
8123,DR HENRY MORE.,"and tedious,' but it is in some parts prosaic, and in others obscure."
8124,DR HENRY MORE.,"The gleams of fancy in it are genuine, but few and far between. But his"
8125,DR HENRY MORE.,"prose works constitute, like those of Cudworth, Charnock, Jeremy Taylor,"
8126,DR HENRY MORE.,"and John Scott, a vast old quarry, abounding both in blocks and in gems"
8127,DR HENRY MORE.,"--blocks of granite solidity, and gems of starry lustre. The peculiarity"
8128,DR HENRY MORE.,"of More is in that poetico-philosophic mist which, like the autumnal"
8129,DR HENRY MORE.,"gossamer, hangs in light and beautiful festoons over his thoughts, and"
8130,DR HENRY MORE.,which suggests pleasing memories of Plato and the Alexandrian school.
8131,DR HENRY MORE.,"Like all the followers of the Grecian sage, he dwells in a region of"
8132,DR HENRY MORE.,"'ideas,' which are to him the only realities, and are not cold, but"
8133,DR HENRY MORE.,warm; he sees all things in Divine solution; the visible is lost in the
8134,DR HENRY MORE.,"invisible, and nature retires before her God. Surely they are splendid"
8135,DR HENRY MORE.,reveries those of the Platonic school; but it is sad to reflect that
8136,DR HENRY MORE.,"they have not cast the slightest gleam of light on the dark, frightful,"
8137,DR HENRY MORE.,faith-shattering mysteries which perplex all inquirers. The old shadows
8138,DR HENRY MORE.,"of sin, death, damnation, evil, and hell, are found to darken the 'ideas'"
8139,DR HENRY MORE.,"of Plato's world quite as deeply as they do the actualities of this weary,"
8140,DR HENRY MORE.,"work-day earth, into which men have, for some inscrutable purpose, been"
8141,DR HENRY MORE.,"sent to be, on the whole, miserable,--so often to toil without compen-"
8142,DR HENRY MORE.,"sation, to suffer without benefit, and to hope without fulfilment."

8465,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"Vaughan was torn in Wales, on the banks of the Uske, in Brecknockshire,"
8466,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"in 1614. His father was a gentleman, but, we presume, poor, as his son"
8467,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"was bred to a profession. Young Vaughan became first a lawyer, and then"
8468,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"a physician; and we suppose, had it not been for his advanced life, he"
8469,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"would have become latterly a clergyman, since he grew, when old,"
8470,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"exceedingly devout. In life, he was not fortunate, and we find him, like"
8471,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"Chamberlayne, complaining bitterly of the poverty of the poetical tribe."
8472,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"In 1651, he published a volume of verse, in which nascent excellence"
8473,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"struggles with dim obscurities, like a young moon with heavy clouds. But"
8474,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"his 'Silex Scintillans,' or 'Sacred Poems,' produced in later life,"
8475,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"attests at once the depth of his devotion, and the truth and originality"
8476,HENRY VAUGHAN.,of his genius. He died in 1695.
8477,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
8478,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"Campbell, always prone to be rather severe on pious poets, and whose"
8479,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"taste, too, was finical at times, says of Vaughan--'He is one of the"
8480,HENRY VAUGHAN.,harshest even of the inferior order of the school of conceit; but he has
8481,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"some few scattered thoughts that meet the eye amidst his harsh pages,"
8482,HENRY VAUGHAN.,like wild flowers on a barren heath.' Surely this is rather 'harsh'
8483,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"judgment. At the same time, it is not a little laughable to find that"
8484,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Campbell has himself appropriated one of these 'wild flowers.' In his
8485,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"beautiful 'Rainbow,' he cries--"
8486,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
8487,HENRY VAUGHAN.,'How came the world's gray fathers forth
8488,HENRY VAUGHAN.,To mark thy sacred sign!'
8489,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
8490,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Vaughan had said--
8491,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
8492,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"'How bright wert thou, when Shem's admiring eye,"
8493,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"Thy burnished, flaming arch did first descry;"
8494,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"When Terah, Nahor, Haran, Abram, Lot,"
8495,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"The youthful world's gray fathers in one knot,"
8496,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Did with intentive looks watch every hour
8497,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"For thy new light, and trembled at each shower!'"
8498,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
8499,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"Indeed, all Campbell's 'Rainbow' is just a reflection of Vaughan's, and"
8500,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"reminds you of those faint, pale shadows of the heavenly bow you"
8501,HENRY VAUGHAN.,sometimes see in the darkened and disarranged skies of spring. To steal
8502,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"from, and then strike down the victim, is more suitable to robbers than"
8503,HENRY VAUGHAN.,to poets.
8504,HENRY VAUGHAN.,
8505,HENRY VAUGHAN.,Perhaps the best criticism on Vaughan may be found in the title of his
8506,HENRY VAUGHAN.,"own poems, 'Silex Scintillans.' He had a good deal of the dulness and"

9645,THE DAWNING.,Shall it in the evening run
9646,THE DAWNING.,When our words and works are done?
9647,THE DAWNING.,Or will thy all-surprising light
9648,THE DAWNING.,"Break at midnight,"
9649,THE DAWNING.,When either sleep or some dark pleasure
9650,THE DAWNING.,Possesseth mad man without measure?
9651,THE DAWNING.,"Or shall these early, fragrant hours"
9652,THE DAWNING.,"Unlock thy bowers,"
9653,THE DAWNING.,And with their blush of light descry
9654,THE DAWNING.,Thy locks crowned with eternity?
9655,THE DAWNING.,"Indeed, it is the only time"
9656,THE DAWNING.,That with thy glory doth best chime;
9657,THE DAWNING.,"All now are stirring, every field"
9658,THE DAWNING.,Full hymns doth yield;
9659,THE DAWNING.,"The whole creation shakes off night,"

9676,THE DAWNING.,"But as this restless, vocal spring"
9677,THE DAWNING.,"All day and night doth run and sing,"
9678,THE DAWNING.,"And though here born, yet is acquainted"
9679,THE DAWNING.,"Elsewhere, and flowing keeps untainted;"
9680,THE DAWNING.,So let me all my busy age
9681,THE DAWNING.,In thy free services engage;
9682,THE DAWNING.,"And though, while here, of force I must"
9683,THE DAWNING.,"Have commerce sometimes with poor dust,"
9684,THE DAWNING.,"And in my flesh, though vile and low,"

10417,PSALM CIV.,With thy least touch; lightnings and winds that rage
10418,PSALM CIV.,At thy rebuke are broke.
10419,PSALM CIV.,
10420,PSALM CIV.,23 Therefore as long as thou wilt give me breath
10421,PSALM CIV.,I will in songs to thy great name employ

10424,PSALM CIV.,
10425,PSALM CIV.,"24 I'll spice my thoughts with thee, and from thy word"

10432,THE TIMBER.,
10433,THE TIMBER.,"1  Sure thou didst flourish once! and many springs,"
10434,THE TIMBER.,"Many bright mornings, much dew, many showers"
10435,THE TIMBER.,"Passed o'er thy head; many light hearts and wings,"
10436,THE TIMBER.,"Which now are dead, lodged in thy living bowers."
10437,THE TIMBER.,
10438,THE TIMBER.,2  And still a new succession sings and flies;
10439,THE TIMBER.,"Fresh groves grow up, and their green branches shoot"
10440,THE TIMBER.,"Towards the old and still-enduring skies,"
10441,THE TIMBER.,While the low violet thrives at their root.
10442,THE TIMBER.,
10443,THE TIMBER.,"3  But thou, beneath the sad and heavy line"
10444,THE TIMBER.,"Of death, doth waste all senseless, cold, and dark;"
10445,THE TIMBER.,"Where not so much as dreams of light may shine,"
10446,THE TIMBER.,"Nor any thought of greenness, leaf, or bark."
10447,THE TIMBER.,
10448,THE TIMBER.,"4  And yet, as if some deep hate and dissent,"
10449,THE TIMBER.,"Bred in thy growth betwixt high winds and thee,"
10450,THE TIMBER.,"Were still alive, thou dost great storms resent,"
10451,THE TIMBER.,"Before they come, and know'st how near they be."
10452,THE TIMBER.,
10453,THE TIMBER.,"5  Else all at rest thou liest, and the fierce breath"
10454,THE TIMBER.,Of tempests can no more disturb thy ease;
10455,THE TIMBER.,But this thy strange resentment after death
10456,THE TIMBER.,Means only those who broke in life thy peace.
10457,THE TIMBER.,
10458,THE TIMBER.,"6  So murdered man, when lovely life is done,"
10459,THE TIMBER.,"And his blood freezed, keeps in the centre still"
10460,THE TIMBER.,"Some secret sense, which makes the dead blood run"
10461,THE TIMBER.,At his approach that did the body kill.
10462,THE TIMBER.,
10463,THE TIMBER.,7  And is there any murderer worse than sin?
10464,THE TIMBER.,Or any storms more foul than a lewd life?
10465,THE TIMBER.,Or what resentient can work more within
10466,THE TIMBER.,"Than true remorse, when with past sins at strife?"
10467,THE TIMBER.,
10468,THE TIMBER.,"8  He that hath left life's vain joys and vain care,"
10469,THE TIMBER.,"And truly hates to be detained on earth,"
10470,THE TIMBER.,"Hath got an house where many mansions are,"
10471,THE TIMBER.,And keeps his soul unto eternal mirth.
10472,THE TIMBER.,
10473,THE TIMBER.,"9  But though thus dead unto the world, and ceased"
10474,THE TIMBER.,"From sin, he walks a narrow, private way;"
10475,THE TIMBER.,"Yet grief and old wounds make him sore displeased,"
10476,THE TIMBER.,"And all his life a rainy, weeping day."
10477,THE TIMBER.,
10478,THE TIMBER.,"10 For though he should forsake the world, and live"
10479,THE TIMBER.,As mere a stranger as men long since dead;
10480,THE TIMBER.,Yet joy itself will make a right soul grieve
10481,THE TIMBER.,To think he should be so long vainly led.
10482,THE TIMBER.,
10483,THE TIMBER.,"11 But as shades set off light, so tears and grief,"
10484,THE TIMBER.,"Though of themselves but a sad blubbered story,"
10485,THE TIMBER.,"By showing the sin great, show the relief"
10486,THE TIMBER.,"Far greater, and so speak my Saviour's glory."
10487,THE TIMBER.,
10488,THE TIMBER.,"12 If my way lies through deserts and wild woods,"
10489,THE TIMBER.,Where all the land with scorching heat is cursed;
10490,THE TIMBER.,Better the pools should flow with rain and floods
10491,THE TIMBER.,"To fill my bottle, than I die with thirst."
10492,THE TIMBER.,
10493,THE TIMBER.,"13 Blest showers they are, and streams sent from above;"
10494,THE TIMBER.,Begetting virgins where they use to flow;
10495,THE TIMBER.,"The trees of life no other waters love,"
10496,THE TIMBER.,"Than upper springs, and none else make them grow."
10497,THE TIMBER.,
10498,THE TIMBER.,14 But these chaste fountains flow not till we die.
10499,THE TIMBER.,Some drops may fall before; but a clear spring
10500,THE TIMBER.,"And ever running, till we leave to fling"
10501,THE TIMBER.,"Dirt in her way, will keep above the sky."

10526,THE JEWS.,"And, without root and sap, decay;"
10527,THE JEWS.,Cast by the husbandman away.

10540,THE JEWS.,Towards old Mamre and Eshcol's brook.
10541,THE JEWS.,For surely he
10542,THE JEWS.,Who loved the world so as to give
10543,THE JEWS.,"His only Son to make it free,"
10544,THE JEWS.,Whose Spirit too doth mourn and grieve
10545,THE JEWS.,"To see man lost, will for old love"

10547,THE JEWS.,
10548,THE JEWS.,"4 Faith sojourned first on earth in you,"
10549,THE JEWS.,You were the dear and chosen stock:

11252,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
11253,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"This writer, though little known, appears to us to stand as high almost"
11254,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"as any name in the present volume, and we are proud to reprint here some"
11255,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,considerable specimens of his magnificent poetry.
11256,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
11257,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,Joseph Beaumont was sprung from a collateral branch of the ancient
11258,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"family of the Beaumonts, that family from which sprung Sir John Beaumont,"
11259,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"the author of 'Bosworth Field,' and Francis Beaumont, the celebrated"
11260,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"dramatist. He was born at Hadleigh, in Suffolk. Of his early life nothing"
11261,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"is known. He received his education at Cambridge, where, during the Civil"
11262,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"War, he was fellow and tutor of Peterhouse. Ejected by the Republicans"
11263,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"from his offices, he retired to Hadleigh, and spent his time in the com-"
11264,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"position of his _magnum opus_, 'Psyche.' This poem appeared in 1648; and"
11265,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"in 1702, three years after the author's death, his son published a second"
11266,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"edition, with numerous corrections, and the addition of four cantos by the"
11267,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"author. Beaumont also wrote several minor pieces in English and Latin, a"
11268,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"controversial tract in reply to Henry More's 'Mystery of Godliness,' and"
11269,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"several theological works which are still in MS., according to a provision"
11270,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,in his will to that effect. Peace and perpetuity to their slumbers!
11271,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
11272,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"After the Restoration, our author was not only reinstated in his former"
11273,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"situations, but received from his patron, Bishop Wren, several valuable"
11274,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"pieces of preferment besides. Afterwards, he exercised successively the"
11275,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"offices of Master of Jesus and of Peterhouse, and was King's Professor"
11276,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,of Divinity from 1670 to 1699. In the latter year he died.
11277,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
11278,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"While praising the genius of Beaumont, we are far from commending his"
11279,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"'Psyche,' either as an artistic whole, or as a readable book. It is,"
11280,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"sooth to say, a dull allegory, in twenty-four immense cantos, studded"
11281,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,with the rarest beauties. It is considerably longer than the 'Faery
11282,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Queen,' nearly four times the length of the 'Paradise Lost,' and five or"
11283,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,six times as long as the 'Excursion.' To read it through now-a-days were
11284,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,to perform a purgatorial penance. But the imagination and fancy are
11285,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Spenserian, his colouring is often Titianesque in gorgeousness, and his"
11286,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"pictures of shadows, abstractions, and all fantastic forms, are so"
11287,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"forcible as to seem to start from the canvas. In painting the beautiful,"
11288,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,his verse becomes careless and flowing as a loosened zone; in painting
11289,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"the frightful and the infernal, his language, like his feeling, seems to"
11290,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"curdle and stiffen in horror, as where, speaking of Satan, he says--"
11291,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
11292,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,'His tawny teeth
11293,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Were ragged grown, by endless _gnashing at"
11294,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,The dismal riddle of his living death._'
11295,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,
11296,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"The 'Psyche' may be compared to a palace of Fairyland, where successive"
11297,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,doors fly open to the visitor--one revealing a banqueting-room filled
11298,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"with the materials of exuberant mirth; another, an enchanted garden,"
11299,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"with streams stealing from grottos, and nymphs gliding through groves;"
11300,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,a third conducting you to a dungeon full of dead men's bones and all
11301,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"uncleanness; a fourth, to a pit which seems the mouth of hell, and"
11302,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"whence cries of torture come up, shaking the smoke that ascendeth up for"
11303,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"ever and ever; and a fifth, to the open roof, over which the stars are"
11304,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"seen bending, and the far-off heavens are opening in glory; and of these"
11305,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"doors there is no end. We saw, when lately in Copenhagen, the famous"
11306,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"tower of the Trinity Church, remarkable for the grand view commanded"
11307,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"from the summit, and for the broad spiral ascent winding within it"
11308,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"almost to the top, up which it is said Peter the Great, in 1716, used to"
11309,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,drive himself and his Empress in a coach-and-four. It was curious to
11310,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"feel ourselves ascending on a path nearly level, and without the"
11311,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"slightest perspiration or fatigue; and here, we thought, is the"
11312,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,desiderated 'royal road' to difficulties fairly found. Large poems
11313,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"should be constructed on the same principle; their quiet, broad interest"
11314,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,should beguile their readers alike to their length and their loftiness.
11315,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,It is exactly the reverse with 'Psyche.' But if any reader is wearied of
11316,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"some of the extracts we have given, such as his verses on 'Eve,' on"
11317,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"'Paradise,' on 'End,' on 'The Death of his Wife,' and on 'Imperial"
11318,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,"Rome,' we shall be very much disposed to question his capacity for"
11319,DR JOSEPH BEAUMONT.,appreciating true poetry.

11380,JOSEPH'S DREAM.,

11537,EVE.,"Pomegranate fragments, which rejoiced to lie"
11538,EVE.,"In dainty ambush, and peep through their cover"
11539,EVE.,Of amber-locks whose volume curled over.
11540,EVE.,
11541,EVE.,2  The fuller stream of her luxuriant hair
11542,EVE.,Poured down itself upon her ivory back:
11543,EVE.,In which soft flood ten thousand graces were
11544,EVE.,Sporting and dallying with every lock;
11545,EVE.,"The rival winds for kisses fell to fight,"
11546,EVE.,And raised a ruffling tempest of delight.
11547,EVE.,
11548,EVE.,"3  Two princely arches, of most equal measures,"
11549,EVE.,"Held up the canopy above her eyes,"
11550,EVE.,"And opened to the heavens far richer treasures,"
11551,EVE.,Than with their stars or sun e'er learn'd to rise:
11552,EVE.,"Those beams can ravish but the body's sight,"
11553,EVE.,These dazzle stoutest souls with mystic light.
11554,EVE.,
11555,EVE.,4  Two garrisons were these of conquering love;
11556,EVE.,"Two founts of life, of spirit, of joy, of grace;"
11557,EVE.,"Two easts in one fair heaven, no more above,"
11558,EVE.,But in the hemisphere of her own face;
11559,EVE.,Two thrones of gallantry; two shops of miracles;
11560,EVE.,Two shrines of deities; two silent oracles.
11561,EVE.,
11562,EVE.,5  For silence here could eloquently plead;
11563,EVE.,Here might the unseen soul be clearly read:
11564,EVE.,"Though gentle humours their mild mixture made,"
11565,EVE.,They proved a double burning-glass which shed
11566,EVE.,"Those living flames which, with enlivening darts,"
11567,EVE.,Shoot deaths of love into spectators' hearts.
11568,EVE.,
11569,EVE.,"6  'Twixt these, an alabaster promontory"
11570,EVE.,Sloped gently down to part each cheek from other;
11571,EVE.,"Where white and red strove for the fairer glory,"
11572,EVE.,Blending in sweet confusion together.
11573,EVE.,The rose and lily never joined were
11574,EVE.,In so divine a marriage as there.
11575,EVE.,
11576,EVE.,7  Couchant upon these precious cushionets
11577,EVE.,"Were thousand beauties, and as many smiles,"
11578,EVE.,"Chaste blandishments, and modest cooling heats,"
11579,EVE.,"Harmless temptations, and honest guiles."
11580,EVE.,"For heaven, though up betimes the maid to deck,"
11581,EVE.,Ne'er made Aurora's cheeks so fair and sleek.
11582,EVE.,
11583,EVE.,"8  Enamouring neatness, softness, pleasure, at"
11584,EVE.,Her gracious mouth in full retinue stood;
11585,EVE.,"For, next the eyes' bright glass, the soul at that"
11586,EVE.,Takes most delight to look and walk abroad.
11587,EVE.,"But at her lips two threads of scarlet lay,"
11588,EVE.,"Or two warm corals, to adorn the way,--"
11589,EVE.,
11590,EVE.,"9  The precious way whereby her breath and tongue,"
11591,EVE.,"Her odours and her honey, travelled,"
11592,EVE.,Which nicest critics would have judged among
11593,EVE.,Arabian or Hyblaean mountains bred.
11594,EVE.,"Indeed, the richer Araby in her"

11596,EVE.,
11597,EVE.,10 More gracefully its golden chapiter
11598,EVE.,No column of white marble e'er sustained
11599,EVE.,Than her round polished neck supported her
11600,EVE.,"Illustrious head, which there in triumph reigned."
11601,EVE.,"Yet neither would this pillar hardness know,"
11602,EVE.,Nor suffer cold to dwell amongst its snow.
11603,EVE.,
11604,EVE.,11 Her blessed bosom moderately rose
11605,EVE.,"With two soft mounts of lilies, whose fair top"
11606,EVE.,"A pair of pretty sister cherries chose,"
11607,EVE.,And there their living crimson lifted up.
11608,EVE.,The milky countenance of the hills confessed
11609,EVE.,What kind of springs within had made their nest.
11610,EVE.,
11611,EVE.,12 So leggiadrous were her snowy hands
11612,EVE.,That pleasure moved as any finger stirred:
11613,EVE.,Her virgin waxen arms were precious bands
11614,EVE.,And chains of love: her waist itself did gird
11615,EVE.,"With its own graceful slenderness, and tie"
11616,EVE.,Up delicacy's best epitome.
11617,EVE.,
11618,EVE.,"13 Fair politure walked all her body over,"
11619,EVE.,And symmetry rejoiced in every part;
11620,EVE.,"Soft and white sweetness was her native cover,"
11621,EVE.,From every member beauty shot a dart:
11622,EVE.,"From heaven to earth, from head to foot I mean,"
11623,EVE.,No blemish could by envy's self be seen.
11624,EVE.,
11625,EVE.,14 This was the first-born queen of gallantry;
11626,EVE.,"All gems compounded into one rich stone,"
11627,EVE.,All sweets knit into one conspiracy;
11628,EVE.,A constellation of all stars in one;
11629,EVE.,"Who, when she was presented to their view,"
11630,EVE.,Both paradise and nature dazzled grew.
11631,EVE.,
11632,EVE.,"15 Phoebus, who rode in glorious scorn's career"
11633,EVE.,"About the world, no sooner spied her face,"
11634,EVE.,"But fain he would have lingered, from his sphere"
11635,EVE.,"On this, though less, yet sweeter, heaven, to gaze"
11636,EVE.,"Till shame enforced him to lash on again,"
11637,EVE.,And clearer wash him in the western main.

11641,EVE.,Embracing with entirest liberty
11642,EVE.,"A body soft, and sweet, and chaste as his."
11643,EVE.,All odorous gales that had but strength to stir
11644,EVE.,Came flocking in to beg perfumes of her.
11645,EVE.,
11646,EVE.,"17 The marigold her garish love forgot,"
11647,EVE.,And turned her homage to these fairer eyes;

11649,EVE.,"Their wonder hither, whence they saw arise"
11650,EVE.,"Unparching courteous lustre, which instead"
