43,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.
44,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,
45,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,
46,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"In preparing the following pages, my aim has been, to produce a book"
47,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"alike entertaining and instructive;--one which, in the reading, should"
48,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"afford an amusement to the mind, pleasant as the spring-blossoms on the"
49,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"tree; and, in its influences on the heart in after life, be like the"
50,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"good fruits that succeed and ripen, to refresh and nourish us, when the"
51,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"vernal season is over and gone, and the voices of the singing-birds are"
52,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,lost in the distance.
53,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,
54,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"Choosing an appropriate title for such a presentation, I have borrowed"
55,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"my idea from the words of the wise king of Israel:--""Hear the"
56,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother; for"
57,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,"" &c., and other"
58,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"Scripture passages of similar figurative meaning; for, though often"
59,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"given in a sportive way, it is my design that no moral shall be"
60,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"conveyed in the volume, but such as a good and judicious parent would"
61,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,wish a child to imbibe.
62,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,
63,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"Accept, then, my young Friends, this new CORONAL of the little flowers"
64,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,of poesy which I have woven for you. When you shall have examined and
65,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"scented it, and found no thorn to pierce--no juice or odor to poison you"
66,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"in its whole circle, wear it for the giver's sake; and enjoy it and"
67,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"profit by its healthful influences, for your own."
68,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,
69,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"Gladly would I feel assured that, in some future years,--when I shall"
70,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"have done with earthly flowers, and you will be engaged in the busy"
71,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"scenes and arduous duties of mature life,--the import of these leaves"
72,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"may from time to time arise to your memory, in all its dewy freshness,"
73,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"like the fragrance which the summer-breeze wafts after us, from the"
74,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"lilies and violets we have passed and left far behind us, in our morning"
75,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"rambles. Then, if not to-day, you will be convinced that I was--as now I"
76,TO THE YOUTH OF MY COUNTRY.,"am,"

204,CONTENTS,
205,CONTENTS,"And these would sometimes come, and cheer"
206,CONTENTS,"The widow with a song,"
207,CONTENTS,"To let her feel a neighbor near,"
208,CONTENTS,And wing an hour along.
209,CONTENTS,
210,CONTENTS,"A pond, supplied by hidden springs,"
211,CONTENTS,"With lilies bordered round,"
212,CONTENTS,"Was found among the richest things,"
213,CONTENTS,That blessed the widow's ground.
214,CONTENTS,
215,CONTENTS,"She had, besides, a gentle brook,"
216,CONTENTS,"That wound the meadow through,"
217,CONTENTS,"Which from the pond its being took,"
218,CONTENTS,And had its treasures too.
219,CONTENTS,
220,CONTENTS,Her eldest orphan was a son;
221,CONTENTS,"For, children she had three;"
222,CONTENTS,"She called him, though a little one,"
223,CONTENTS,Her hope for days to be.
224,CONTENTS,
225,CONTENTS,And well he might be reckoned so;
226,CONTENTS,"If, from the tender shoot,"
227,CONTENTS,We know the way the branch will grow;
228,CONTENTS,"Or, by the flower, the fruit."
229,CONTENTS,
230,CONTENTS,"His tongue was true, his mind was bright;"
231,CONTENTS,His temper smooth and mild:
232,CONTENTS,He was--the parent's chief delight--
233,CONTENTS,A good and pleasant child.
234,CONTENTS,
235,CONTENTS,He'd gather chips and sticks of wood
236,CONTENTS,The winter fire to make;
237,CONTENTS,"And help his mother dress their food,"
238,CONTENTS,Or tend the baking cake.
239,CONTENTS,
240,CONTENTS,In summer time he'd kindly lead
241,CONTENTS,"His little sisters out,"
242,CONTENTS,"To pick wild berries on the mead,"
243,CONTENTS,And fish the brook for trout.
244,CONTENTS,
245,CONTENTS,He stirred his thoughts for ways to earn
246,CONTENTS,"Some little gain; and hence,"
247,CONTENTS,Contrived the silver pond to turn.
248,CONTENTS,"In part, to silver pence."
249,CONTENTS,
250,CONTENTS,He found the lilies blooming there
251,CONTENTS,"So spicy sweet to smell,"
252,CONTENTS,"And to the eye so pure and fair,"
253,CONTENTS,He plucked them up to sell.
254,CONTENTS,
255,CONTENTS,He could not to the market go:
256,CONTENTS,"He had too young a head,"
257,CONTENTS,The distant city's ways to know;
258,CONTENTS,The route he could not tread.
259,CONTENTS,
260,CONTENTS,"But, when the coming coach-wheels rolled"
261,CONTENTS,"To pass his humble cot,"
262,CONTENTS,His bunch of lilies to be sold
263,CONTENTS,Was ready on the spot.
264,CONTENTS,
265,CONTENTS,"He'd stand beside the way, and hold"
266,CONTENTS,"His treasures up to show,"
267,CONTENTS,That looked like yellow stars of gold
268,CONTENTS,Just set in leaves of snow.
269,CONTENTS,
270,CONTENTS,"""O buy my lilies!"" he would say;"
271,CONTENTS,"""You'll find them new and sweet:"
272,CONTENTS,"So fresh from out the pond are they,"
273,CONTENTS,"I haven't dried my feet!"""
274,CONTENTS,
275,CONTENTS,And then he showed the dust that clung
276,CONTENTS,"Upon his garment's hem,"
277,CONTENTS,"Where late the water-drops had hung,"
278,CONTENTS,When he had gathered them.
279,CONTENTS,
280,CONTENTS,"And while the carriage checked its pace,"
281,CONTENTS,"To take the lilies in,"
282,CONTENTS,His artless orphan tongue and face
283,CONTENTS,Some bright return would win.
284,CONTENTS,
285,CONTENTS,"For many a noble stranger's hand,"
286,CONTENTS,"With open purse, was seen,"
287,CONTENTS,"To cast a coin upon the sand,"
288,CONTENTS,Or on the sloping green.
289,CONTENTS,
290,CONTENTS,And many a smiling lady threw
291,CONTENTS,The child a silver piece;
292,CONTENTS,"And thus, as fast as lilies grew,"
293,CONTENTS,He saw his wealth increase.
294,CONTENTS,
295,CONTENTS,"While little more--and little more,"
296,CONTENTS,"Was gathered by their sale,"
297,CONTENTS,His widowed mother's frugal store
298,CONTENTS,Would never wholly fail.
299,CONTENTS,
300,CONTENTS,"For He, who made, and feeds the bird,"
301,CONTENTS,Her little children fed.
302,CONTENTS,He knew her trust: her cry he heard;
303,CONTENTS,And answered it with bread.
304,CONTENTS,
305,CONTENTS,"And thus, protected by the Power,"
306,CONTENTS,"Who made the lily fair,"
307,CONTENTS,"Her orphans, like the meadow flower,"
308,CONTENTS,Grew up in beauty there.
309,CONTENTS,
310,CONTENTS,"Her son, the good and prudent boy,"
311,CONTENTS,"Who wisely thus began,"
312,CONTENTS,Was long the aged widow's joy;
313,CONTENTS,And lived an honored man.
314,CONTENTS,
315,CONTENTS,"He had a ship, for which he chose"
316,CONTENTS,"""The LILY"" as a name,"
317,CONTENTS,"To keep in memory whence he rose,"
318,CONTENTS,And how his fortune came.'
319,CONTENTS,
320,CONTENTS,"He had a lily carved, and set,"
321,CONTENTS,"Her emblem, on her stem;"
322,CONTENTS,"And she was called, by all she met,"
323,CONTENTS,A beauteous ocean gem.
324,CONTENTS,
325,CONTENTS,"She bore sweet spices, treasures bright;"
326,CONTENTS,"And, on the waters wide,"
327,CONTENTS,Her sails as lily-leaves were white:
328,CONTENTS,Her name was well applied.
329,CONTENTS,
330,CONTENTS,Her feeling owner never spurned
331,CONTENTS,The presence of the poor;
332,CONTENTS,And found that all he gave returned
333,CONTENTS,In blessings rich and sure.
334,CONTENTS,
335,CONTENTS,The God who by the lily-pond
336,CONTENTS,"Had drawn his heart above,"
337,CONTENTS,In after life preserved the bond
338,CONTENTS,"Of grateful, holy love."
339,CONTENTS,
340,CONTENTS,
341,CONTENTS,
342,CONTENTS,
343,CONTENTS,=The Humming-Bird's Anger=
344,CONTENTS,
345,CONTENTS,"""Small as the humming-bird is, it has great courage and violent"
346,CONTENTS,"passions. If it find a flower that has been deprived of its honey, it"
347,CONTENTS,"will pluck it off, throw it on the ground, and sometimes tear it to"
348,CONTENTS,"pieces."" BUFFON."
349,CONTENTS,
350,CONTENTS,"On light little wings as the humming-birds fly,"
351,CONTENTS,"With plumes many-hued as the bow of the sky,"
352,CONTENTS,"Suspended in ether, they shine to the light"
353,CONTENTS,As jewels of nature high-finished and bright.
354,CONTENTS,
355,CONTENTS,Their vision-like forms are so buoyant and small
356,CONTENTS,"They hang o'er the flowers, as too airy to fall,"
357,CONTENTS,"Up-borne by their beautiful pinions, that seem"
358,CONTENTS,"Like glittering vapor, or parts of a dream."
359,CONTENTS,
360,CONTENTS,"The humming-bird feeds upon honey; and so,"
361,CONTENTS,"Of course, 'tis a sweet little creature, you know."
362,CONTENTS,"But sweet little creatures have sometimes, they say,"
363,CONTENTS,"A great deal that's bitter, or sour, to betray!"
364,CONTENTS,
365,CONTENTS,And often the humming-bird's delicate breast
366,CONTENTS,Is found of a very high temper possessed.
367,CONTENTS,"Such essence of anger within it is pent,"
368,CONTENTS,'Twould burst did no safety-valve give it a vent.
369,CONTENTS,
370,CONTENTS,"Displeased, it will seem a bright vial of wrath,"
371,CONTENTS,"Uncorked by its heat, the offender to scath;"
372,CONTENTS,"And, taking occasion to let off its ire,"
373,CONTENTS,'Tis startling to witness how high it will fire.
374,CONTENTS,
375,CONTENTS,"A humming-bird once o'er a trumpet-flower hung,"
376,CONTENTS,"And darted that sharp little member, the tongue,"
377,CONTENTS,"At once to the nectarine cell, for the sweet"
378,CONTENTS,She felt at the bottom most certain to meet.
379,CONTENTS,
380,CONTENTS,"But, finding some other light child of the air"
381,CONTENTS,"To rifle its store, had already been there;"
382,CONTENTS,"And no drop of honey for her to draw up,"
383,CONTENTS,Her vengeance broke forth on the destitute cup.
384,CONTENTS,
385,CONTENTS,"She flew in a passion, that heightened her power;"
386,CONTENTS,"And cuffing, and shaking the innocent flower,"
387,CONTENTS,Its tender corolla in shred after shred
388,CONTENTS,She hastily stripped; then she snapped off its head.
389,CONTENTS,
390,CONTENTS,"A delicate ruin, on earth as it lay,"
391,CONTENTS,"That bright little fury went, humming, away,"
392,CONTENTS,"With gossamer softness, and fair to the eye,"
393,CONTENTS,"Like some living brilliant, just dropped from the sky."
394,CONTENTS,
395,CONTENTS,"And since, when that curious bird I behold"
396,CONTENTS,"Arrayed in rich colors, and dusted with gold,"
397,CONTENTS,I cannot but think of the wrath and the spite
398,CONTENTS,"She has in reserve, though they're now out of sight."
399,CONTENTS,
400,CONTENTS,"Ye two-footed, beautiful, passionate things,"
401,CONTENTS,"If plumy or plumeless--without, or with wings,"
402,CONTENTS,"Beware, lest ye break, in some hazardous hour,"
403,CONTENTS,"Your vials of wrath, hot, or bitter, or sour!"
404,CONTENTS,
405,CONTENTS,And would ye but know how at times ye do seem
406,CONTENTS,"Transformed to bright furies, or frights in a dream,"
407,CONTENTS,"Go, stand at the glass--to the painter go sit,"
408,CONTENTS,When anger is just at the height of its fit!
409,CONTENTS,
410,CONTENTS,
411,CONTENTS,
412,CONTENTS,
413,CONTENTS,=The Butterfly's Dream=
414,CONTENTS,
415,CONTENTS,"A tulip, just opened, had offered to hold"
416,CONTENTS,A butterfly gaudy and gay;
417,CONTENTS,"And rocked in his cradle of crimson and gold,"
418,CONTENTS,The careless young slumberer lay.
419,CONTENTS,
420,CONTENTS,"For the butterfly slept;--as such thoughtless ones will,"
421,CONTENTS,"At ease, and reclining on flowers;--"
422,CONTENTS,"If ever they study, 'tis how they may kill"
423,CONTENTS,The best of their mid-summer hours!
424,CONTENTS,
425,CONTENTS,"And the butterfly dreamed, as is often the case"
426,CONTENTS,"With _indolent_ lovers of change,"
427,CONTENTS,"Who, keeping the body at ease in its place,"
428,CONTENTS,Give fancy permission to range.
429,CONTENTS,
430,CONTENTS,"He dreamed that he saw, what he could but despise,"
431,CONTENTS,The swarm from a neighboring hive;
432,CONTENTS,"Which, having come out for their winter supplies,"
433,CONTENTS,Had made the whole garden alive.
434,CONTENTS,
435,CONTENTS,"He looked with disgust, as the proud often do,"
436,CONTENTS,"On the diligent movements of those,"
437,CONTENTS,"Who, keeping both present and future in view,"
438,CONTENTS,Improve every hour as it goes.
439,CONTENTS,
440,CONTENTS,"As the brisk little alchymists passed to and fro,"
441,CONTENTS,With anger the butterfly swelled;
442,CONTENTS,And called them mechanics--a rabble too low
443,CONTENTS,To come near the station he held.
444,CONTENTS,
445,CONTENTS,"""Away from my presence!"" said he, in his sleep,"
446,CONTENTS,"""Ye humble plebeians! nor dare"
447,CONTENTS,Come here with your colorless winglets to sweep
448,CONTENTS,"The king of this brilliant parterre!"""
449,CONTENTS,
450,CONTENTS,"He thought, at these words, that together they flew,"
451,CONTENTS,"And, facing about, made a stand;"
452,CONTENTS,"And then, to a terrible army they grew,"
453,CONTENTS,And fenced him on every hand.
454,CONTENTS,
455,CONTENTS,"Like hosts of huge giants, his numberless foes"
456,CONTENTS,Seemed spreading to measureless size:
457,CONTENTS,"Their wings with a mighty expansion arose,"
458,CONTENTS,And stretched like a veil o'er the skies.
459,CONTENTS,
460,CONTENTS,"Their eyes seemed like little volcanoes, for fire,--"
461,CONTENTS,"Their hum, to a cannon-peal grown,--"
462,CONTENTS,"Farina to bullets was rolled in their ire,"
463,CONTENTS,"And, he thought, hurled at him and his throne."
464,CONTENTS,
465,CONTENTS,"He tried to cry quarter! his voice would not sound,"
466,CONTENTS,His head ached--his throne reeled and fell;
467,CONTENTS,"His enemy cheered, as he came to the ground,"
468,CONTENTS,"And cried, ""King Papilio, farewell!"""
469,CONTENTS,
470,CONTENTS,"His fall chased the vision--the sleeper awoke,"
471,CONTENTS,The wonderful dream to expound;
472,CONTENTS,"The lightning's bright flash from the thunder-cloud broke,"
473,CONTENTS,And hail-stones were rattling around.
474,CONTENTS,
475,CONTENTS,"He'd slumbered so long, that now, over his head,"
476,CONTENTS,The tempest's artillery rolled;
477,CONTENTS,"The tulip was shattered--the whirl-blast had fled,"
478,CONTENTS,And borne off its crimson and gold.
479,CONTENTS,
480,CONTENTS,"'Tis said, for the fall and the pelting, combined"
481,CONTENTS,With suppressed ebullitions of pride.
482,CONTENTS,"This vain son of summer no balsam could find,"
483,CONTENTS,But he crept under covert and died!
484,CONTENTS,
485,CONTENTS,
486,CONTENTS,
487,CONTENTS,
488,CONTENTS,=The Boy and the Cricket=
489,CONTENTS,
490,CONTENTS,"At length I have thee! my brisk new-comer,"
491,CONTENTS,Sounding thy lay to departing summer;
492,CONTENTS,"And I'll take thee up from thy bed of grass,"
493,CONTENTS,And carry thee home to a house of glass;
494,CONTENTS,"Where thy slender limbs, and the faded green"
495,CONTENTS,"Of thy close-made coat, can all be seen."
496,CONTENTS,"For I long to know if the cricket _sings_,"
497,CONTENTS,Or _plays_ the tune with his gauzy wings;--
498,CONTENTS,To bring that shrill-toned pipe to light
499,CONTENTS,"Which kept me awake so long last night,"
500,CONTENTS,"That I told the hours by the lazy clock,"
501,CONTENTS,Till I heard the crow of the noisy cock;
502,CONTENTS,"When, tossing and turning, at length I fell"
503,CONTENTS,"In a sleep so strange, that the dream I'll tell."
504,CONTENTS,
505,CONTENTS,"Methought, on a flowery bank I lay,"
506,CONTENTS,By a beautiful stream; and watched the play
507,CONTENTS,"Of the sparkling wavelets, that fled so fast,"
508,CONTENTS,I could not number them as they passed.
509,CONTENTS,But I marked the things which they carried by;
510,CONTENTS,And a neat little skiff first caught my eye.
511,CONTENTS,"'Twas woven of reeds, and its sides were bound"
512,CONTENTS,"By a tender vine, that had clasped it round;"
513,CONTENTS,"And spreading within, had made it seem"
514,CONTENTS,"A basket of leaves, borne down the stream."
515,CONTENTS,And the skiff had neither a sail nor oar;
516,CONTENTS,"But a bright little boy stood up, and bore,"
517,CONTENTS,"On his outstretched hands, a wreath so gay,"
518,CONTENTS,It looked like a crown for the Queen of May.
519,CONTENTS,"And while he was going, I heard him sing,"
520,CONTENTS,"""O seize the garland of passing _Spring!_"""
521,CONTENTS,"But I dared not reach, for the bank was steep;"
522,CONTENTS,"And he bore it away, to the far off deep!"
523,CONTENTS,

558,CONTENTS,A whitened branch that the blast had broke
559,CONTENTS,From the lifeless trunk of an aged oak.

3646,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,But their delicate heads by the frost had been nipped;
3647,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Their stalks by the blast were all twisted and stripped;
3648,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And nothing but ruin was there.
3649,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3650,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""Oh! how the rude autumn has spoiled the green hills!"""
3651,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Exclaimed little Charles, ""and has choked the bright rills"
3652,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,With leaves that are faded and dead!
3653,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,The few on the trees are fast losing their hold.

3660,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"But then, it has opened the chestnut-burr too,"
3661,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,The walnut released from the case where it grew;
3662,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And now our _Thanksgiving_ is nigh!

3664,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""Oh! what do you think we shall do on that day?"""
3665,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""I guess,"" answered Charles, ""we shall all go away"

3668,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"For Grandpa' and Grandma', aunts, uncles and cousins;"
3669,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And at night we'll all play blind-man's-buff.
3670,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3671,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""Perhaps we'll get Grandpa' to tell us some stories"
3672,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"About the old times, with their _Whigs_ and their _Tories_;"
3673,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And what sort of men they could be;
3674,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"When some spread their tables without any cloth,"
3675,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"With basins and spoons, and the fuming bean-broth,"
3676,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Which they took for their coffee and tea.
3677,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3678,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""They'd queer kind of sights, I have heard Grandma' say,"
3679,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"About in their streets; for, if not every day,"
3680,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"At least it was nothing uncommon,"
3681,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To see them pile on the poor back of one horse
3682,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"A saddle and _pillion_; and what was still worse,"
3683,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Up mounted a man and a woman!
3684,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3685,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""The lady held on by the driver; and so,"
3686,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Away about town at full trot would they go;

3688,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"To Thanksgiving-supper--to husking, or ball;"
3689,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Or quilting; for thus did they take nearly all
3690,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Their rides, on an _animal_ carriage!"
3691,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3692,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""I know not what _huskings_ and _quiltings_ maybe;"

3695,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"That stiff damask gown, with its sharp-pointed waist,"
3696,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The hoop, the craped, cushion, and buckles of paste,"

3706,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""Oh! a glorious time we shall have! If they knew"
3707,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"At the south, what it is, I guess they'd have one too;"
3708,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"But I have heard somebody say,"
3709,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"That, there, they call all the New England folks _Bumpkins,_"
3710,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Because we eat puddings, and pies made of pumpkins,"
3711,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And have our good Thanksgiving-day."""
3712,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3713,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""I think, brother Charles,"" returned Edward ""at least,"
3714,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"That they might go to church, if they don't like the feast;"
3715,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"For to me it is much the best part,"
3716,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"To hear the sweet anthems of praise, that we give"
3717,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"To Him, on whose bounty we constantly live:--"

3726,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3727,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""I'm glad,"" said their father, ""to hear such a wish;"

3730,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And now I will give you the money, my sons,"
3731,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Which I promised, you know, for your drum and your guns,"
3732,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"To spend in the way you desire."""
3733,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3734,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The brothers went home, thinking o'er by the way,"
3735,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"For how many comforts this money might pay,"
3736,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,In something for clothing or food:
3737,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"At length they resolved, if their mother would spend it,"
3738,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"For what she thought best, they would get her to send it"

3748,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Once I sat, a shepherd-boy,"
3749,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Watching o'er my father's flock.
3750,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3751,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"We'd a happy cottage-home,"
3752,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Peaceful as the sparrow's nest,"
3753,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Where, at evening, we could come"
3754,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,From our roamings to our rest.
3755,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3756,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I'd a minstrel's voice and ear:
3757,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I could whistle, pipe and sing,"
3758,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"While I roving, seemed to hear"
3759,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Music stir in every thing.
3760,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3761,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"But misfortune, like a blast."
3762,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Swift upon my father rushed;
3763,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,From our dwelling we were cast--
3764,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,At a stroke our peace was crushed.
3765,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3766,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,All we had was seized for debt:
3767,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"In the sudden overthrow,"
3768,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Even my fond, fleecy pet,"
3769,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"My white cosset, too, must go."
3770,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3771,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Then I wandered, sad and lone,"
3772,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Where I'd once a flock to feed;
3773,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,All the treasure now my own
3774,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Was my simple pipe of reed.
3775,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3776,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"But a noble, pitying friend,"
3777,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Who had seen me sadly stray,"
3778,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Made me to his lute attend;
3779,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And he taught me how to play.
3780,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3781,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Then his lute to me he gave;
3782,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And abroad he bade me roam,"
3783,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Till the earnings I could save
3784,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Would redeem our cottage-home.
3785,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3786,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Glad, his counsel straight I took--"
3787,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I received his gift with joy;
3788,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"All my former ways forsook,"
3789,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And became a minstrel-boy.
3790,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3791,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"With my mountain airs to sing,"
3792,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Forward then I roamed afar,"
3793,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Sweeping still the tuneful string--
3794,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Having hope my leading star.
3795,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3796,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"In the hamlets where I've gone,"
3797,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Groups would gather--music-bound:
3798,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,In the cities I have drawn
3799,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,List'ners till my hopes were crowned.
3800,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3801,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Ever saving as I earned,"
3802,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I of one dear object dreamed;
3803,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"To my mountain then returned,"
3804,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And our cottage-home redeemed.

3858,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3859,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"""Dost now ask me, child, since thou hear'st here I've been,"
3860,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Why my brow is so furrowed, my locks white and thin--"

3877,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3878,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,There's many a one who oft has heard
3879,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The name of Robert Kidd,"
3880,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Who cannot tell, perhaps, a word"
3881,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Of him, or what he did."
3882,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3883,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"So, though I never saw the man,"
3884,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And lived not in his day;
3885,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I'll tell you how his guilt began--
3886,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To what it paved the way.
3887,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3888,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,'Twas in New York Kidd had his home;
3889,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And there he left his wife
3890,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And children, when he went to roam,"
3891,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And lead a seaman's life.
3892,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3893,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Now Robert had as firm a hand,"
3894,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"A heart as stern and brave,"
3895,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"As ever met in one on land,"
3896,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Or on the briny wave.
3897,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3898,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"'Twas in the third king William's time,"
3899,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,When many a pirate bold
3900,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Committed on the seas the crime
3901,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Of shedding blood for gold.
3902,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3903,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,So Captain Kidd was singled out
3904,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"As one devoid of fears,"
3905,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To take a ship and cruise about
3906,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Against the Bucaniers.
3907,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3908,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The ship was armed with many a gun,"
3909,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And manned with many a man,"
3910,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Across the southern seas to run
3911,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To foil the pirate's plan.
3912,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3913,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"But when she long, from isle to isle,"
3914,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Without success had sailed,"
3915,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And made no capture all the while,"
3916,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Her master's patience failed.
3917,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3918,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The prizes he so oft had sought,"
3919,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,He found he sought in vain;
3920,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And soon a wicked, bloody thought,"
3921,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Came into Robert's brain!
3922,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3923,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,His mind he opened to his men;
3924,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And found his guilty crew
3925,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Agreed with him, that they, from then,"
3926,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Would all turn pirates too!
3927,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3928,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"He threw his Bible in the deep,"
3929,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Defied its Author's will;
3930,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And, with his conscience put to sleep,"
3931,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Began to rob and kill.
3932,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3933,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And now the desperado reigned,"
3934,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,A tyrant on the waves;
3935,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"While they whose blood his hands had stained,"
3936,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Went down to watery graves.
3937,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3938,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"No merchant ship could near him go,"
3939,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Which he would not annoy;
3940,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"For Kidd was passing to and fro,"
3941,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And seeking to destroy.
3942,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3943,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"He seized the vessel, plunged the knife"
3944,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Within the seamen's breast:
3945,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And by a cruel waste of life,"
3946,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,His evil gains possessed.
3947,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3948,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,He then would make the nearest isle.
3949,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And go at night by stealth,"
3950,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To hide within the earth awhile
3951,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,His last ill-gotten wealth.
3952,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3953,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Thus, many a shining wedge of gold"
3954,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,This modern Achan hid;
3955,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And many a frightful tale was told
3956,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"About the pirate, Kidd."
3957,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3958,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,But Justice does not slumber long;
3959,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"If slow, she's ever sure."
3960,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"There's none too artful, quick, or strong"
3961,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,For her to make secure!
3962,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3963,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"To Boston, with a brazen face,"
3964,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The pirate boldly went,"
3965,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Where he was seized; and in disgrace
3966,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And chains, to England sent."
3967,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3968,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The captain and his crew were there,"
3969,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"A solemn, fearful sight;"
3970,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Resigning life high up in air,"
3971,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,E'en at the gibbet's height!
3972,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3973,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,For many a year their bodies hung
3974,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Along the river side;
3975,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"As beacons, showing old and young"
3976,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,How they had lived and died.
3977,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3978,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,The wealth they hid was never found.
3979,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Though often sought of men.
3980,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"'Tis where they placed it in the ground,"
3981,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Till they should come again!
3982,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
3983,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,The earth has seemed by Heaven constrained.
3984,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,The treasures to withhold
3985,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"That price of blood has none obtained,"
3986,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Or used the pirate's gold!

3994,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And my wings are nearly furled.
3995,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I have caused a scene so dreary,"
3996,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I am glad to quit the world.
3997,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,While with bitterness I'm thinking
3998,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"On the evil I have done,"
3999,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To my caverns deep I'm sinking
4000,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,From the coming of the sun.
4001,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4002,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Oh! the heart of man will sicken
4003,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"In that pure and holy light,"
4004,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,When he feels the hopes I've stricken
4005,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,With an everlasting blight!
4006,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"For, so wildly in my madness"
4007,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Have I poured abroad my wrath,"
4008,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I've been changing joy to sadness;
4009,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And with ruins strewed my path.
4010,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4011,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Earth has shuddered at my motion:--
4012,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,She my power in silence owns;
4013,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"While the troubled, roaring ocean"
4014,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,O'er my deeds of horror moans.
4015,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I have sunk the dearest treasure--
4016,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I've destroyed the fairest form:
4017,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Sadly have I filled my measure;
4018,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And I'm now a dying Storm!
4019,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4020,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Yet, to man among the living,"
4021,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"With my final gasp and sigh,"
4022,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I, a solemn caution giving,"
4023,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Fain would serve him while I die.
4024,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Not like me, shall he, descending"
4025,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Swift to death, from being cease."
4026,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,He's a spirit!--fleetly tending
4027,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To eternal pain or peace!

4030,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4031,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4032,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,=The Little Traveller=.
4033,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4034,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I am the tiniest child of earth!
4035,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"But still, I would like to be known to fame;"
4036,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Though next to nothing I had my birth,"
4037,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And lowest of all in my lowly name.
4038,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4039,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Yet, if so humble my native place,"
4040,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"This I can say, in family pride--"
4041,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"That I'm of the world's most numerous race,"
4042,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And made by the Maker of all beside.
4043,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4044,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Although I'm so poor, I naught to lose;"
4045,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Still I'm so little I can't be lost!
4046,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I journey about, wherever I choose,"
4047,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And those who carry me bear the cost.
4048,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4049,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The most forgiving of earthly things,"
4050,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I often cling to my deadly foe;
4051,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And, spite of the cruellest flirts and flings,"
4052,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Arise by the force that has cast me low.
4053,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4054,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"When beauty has trodden me under foot,"
4055,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I've quietly risen, her face to seek,--"
4056,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Embraced her forehead, and calmly put"
4057,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Myself to rest in her dimpled cheek.
4058,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4059,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I've ridden to war on the soldier's plume;
4060,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"But startled and sprung, at the wild affray,--"
4061,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,The sights of horror--of fire and fume;
4062,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And fled on the wings of the wind away.
4063,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4064,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I've visited courts, and been ushered in"
4065,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,By the proudest guest of the stately scene;
4066,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I've touched his majesty's bosom-pin,"
4067,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,And the nuptial ring of his lofty queen.
4068,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4069,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"At the royal board, in the grand parade,"
4070,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,I've oft been one familiar and free:
4071,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"The fairest lady has smiled, and laid"
4072,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Her delicate, gloveless hand on me."
4073,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4074,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Philosopher, poet, the learned, the sage,"
4075,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Never declines a call from me;
4076,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And all, of every rank and age."
4077,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Admit me into their _coteri_.
4078,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4079,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I visit the lions of every where,"
4080,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"If human, or brute, and can testify"
4081,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"To what they do, to what they wear,"
4082,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,To wonders none ever beheld but I!
4083,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4084,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"And now, reviewing the things I've done,"
4085,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Forgetting my name, my rank and birth,"
4086,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I begin to think I am number ONE,"
4087,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Of the great and manifold things of earth.
4088,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,
4089,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"I've still much more, I yet might tell,"
4090,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,Which modesty bids me here withhold;
4091,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"For fear with my travels I seem to swell,"
4092,CHILDHOOD'S RURAL SONG.,"Or grow, for an ATOM OF DUST, too bold!"
