577,LOVE ONE ANOTHER,"Yet dearly she loved to ponder it o’er,"
578,LOVE ONE ANOTHER,And every day she prized it more;
579,LOVE ONE ANOTHER,For it said--and she looked at her smiling mother--

581,LOVE ONE ANOTHER,
582,LOVE ONE ANOTHER,"She thought it was beautiful in the book,"

645,WE ARE SEVEN,"I met a little cottage girl,"
646,WE ARE SEVEN,"She was eight years old, she said;"
647,WE ARE SEVEN,Her hair was thick with many a curl
648,WE ARE SEVEN,That clustered round her head.
649,WE ARE SEVEN,
650,WE ARE SEVEN,"“Sisters and brothers, little maid,"
651,WE ARE SEVEN,How many may you be?”
652,WE ARE SEVEN,"“How many? seven in all,” she said,"
653,WE ARE SEVEN,And wondering looked at me.
654,WE ARE SEVEN,
655,WE ARE SEVEN,“And where are they? I pray you tell;”
656,WE ARE SEVEN,"She answered, “Seven are we;"
657,WE ARE SEVEN,"And two of us at Conway dwell,"
658,WE ARE SEVEN,And two are gone to sea.
659,WE ARE SEVEN,
660,WE ARE SEVEN,"“Two of us in the churchyard lie,"
661,WE ARE SEVEN,My sister and my brother;
662,WE ARE SEVEN,And in the churchyard cottage I
663,WE ARE SEVEN,Dwell near them with my mother.”
664,WE ARE SEVEN,
665,WE ARE SEVEN,"“You say that two at Conway dwell,"
666,WE ARE SEVEN,"And two are gone to sea,"
667,WE ARE SEVEN,"Yet you are seven; I pray you tell,"
668,WE ARE SEVEN,"Sweet maid, how this may be.”"
669,WE ARE SEVEN,
670,WE ARE SEVEN,"Then did the little maid reply,"
671,WE ARE SEVEN,“Seven boys and girls are we;
672,WE ARE SEVEN,"Two of us in the churchyard lie,"
673,WE ARE SEVEN,Beneath the churchyard tree.”
674,WE ARE SEVEN,
675,WE ARE SEVEN,"“You run about, my little maid,"
676,WE ARE SEVEN,Your limbs they are alive;
677,WE ARE SEVEN,"If two are in the churchyard laid,"
678,WE ARE SEVEN,Then you are only five.”
679,WE ARE SEVEN,
680,WE ARE SEVEN,"“Their graves are green, they may be seen,”"
681,WE ARE SEVEN,"The little maid replied,"
682,WE ARE SEVEN,"“Twelve steps or more from mother’s door,"
683,WE ARE SEVEN,And they are side by side.
684,WE ARE SEVEN,
685,WE ARE SEVEN,“My stockings there I often knit;
686,WE ARE SEVEN,My ’kerchief there I hem;
687,WE ARE SEVEN,And there upon the ground I sit--
688,WE ARE SEVEN,I sit and sing to them.
689,WE ARE SEVEN,
690,WE ARE SEVEN,"“And often after sunset, sir,"
691,WE ARE SEVEN,"When it is light and fair,"
692,WE ARE SEVEN,"I take my little porringer,"
693,WE ARE SEVEN,And eat my supper there.
694,WE ARE SEVEN,
695,WE ARE SEVEN,“The first that died was little Jane;
696,WE ARE SEVEN,"In bed she moaning lay,"
697,WE ARE SEVEN,"Till God released her from her pain,"
698,WE ARE SEVEN,And then she went away.
699,WE ARE SEVEN,
700,WE ARE SEVEN,“So in the churchyard she was laid;

702,WE ARE SEVEN,"Together round her grave we played,"
703,WE ARE SEVEN,My brother John and I.
704,WE ARE SEVEN,
705,WE ARE SEVEN,"“And when the ground was white with snow,"
706,WE ARE SEVEN,"And I could run and slide,"
707,WE ARE SEVEN,My brother John was forced to go
708,WE ARE SEVEN,And he lies by her side.”
709,WE ARE SEVEN,
710,WE ARE SEVEN,"“How many are you, then,” said I,"
711,WE ARE SEVEN,“If those two are in heaven?”
712,WE ARE SEVEN,"The little maiden did reply,"

714,WE ARE SEVEN,
715,WE ARE SEVEN,"“But they are dead--those two are dead,"
716,WE ARE SEVEN,Their spirits are in heaven.”
717,WE ARE SEVEN,"’Twas throwing words away, for still"
718,WE ARE SEVEN,"The little maid would have her will,"

864,A BOY’S FAITH,
865,A BOY’S FAITH,"To labor, she would leave her home,"

1389,HAPPY HELEN,
1390,HAPPY HELEN,"She said, “I should like to be happy to-day,"
1391,HAPPY HELEN,If I could but tell which was the easiest way;
1392,HAPPY HELEN,But then I don’t know any pretty new play:
1393,HAPPY HELEN,
1394,HAPPY HELEN,"“And as to the old ones, why, which is the best?"
1395,HAPPY HELEN,"There’s old blind man’s buff, hide-and-seek, and the rest--"
1396,HAPPY HELEN,"Or pretending it’s tea-time, when dollies are dressed."
1397,HAPPY HELEN,
1398,HAPPY HELEN,“But no; let me see--now I’ve thought of a way
1399,HAPPY HELEN,"Which would really, I think, be still better than play:"
1400,HAPPY HELEN,"I’ll try to be good, if I can, the _whole_ day,"
1401,HAPPY HELEN,
1402,HAPPY HELEN,"“Without any fretting or crying: Oh, no,"
1403,HAPPY HELEN,For _that_ makes me wretched wherever I go;
1404,HAPPY HELEN,And it _would_ be a pity to spoil the day so.
1405,HAPPY HELEN,
1406,HAPPY HELEN,"“I don’t choose to be such a baby, not I,"
1407,HAPPY HELEN,"To be peevish and cross, and just ready to cry;"

1416,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,I will be good all day.”
1417,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,
1418,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,"She lifted up her bright young eyes,"
1419,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,With a soft and pleasing smile;
1420,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,"Then a mother’s kiss was on her lips,"
1421,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,So pure and free from guile.
1422,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,
1423,I WILL BE GOOD TO-DAY,"And when night came, that little one,"

1435,THE HONEST BOY,
1436,THE HONEST BOY,Once there was a little boy
1437,THE HONEST BOY,"With curly hair and pleasant eye,"
1438,THE HONEST BOY,"A boy who always told the truth,"
1439,THE HONEST BOY,"And never, never told a lie."
1440,THE HONEST BOY,
1441,THE HONEST BOY,"And when he trotted off to school,"
1442,THE HONEST BOY,"The children all about would cry,"
1443,THE HONEST BOY,"“There goes the curly-headed boy,"
1444,THE HONEST BOY,The boy that never tells a lie.”
1445,THE HONEST BOY,
1446,THE HONEST BOY,"And everybody loved him so,"
1447,THE HONEST BOY,"Because he always told the truth,"
1448,THE HONEST BOY,"That every day, as he grew up,"
1449,THE HONEST BOY,"’Twas said, “There goes the honest youth.”"
1450,THE HONEST BOY,
1451,THE HONEST BOY,And when the people that stood near
1452,THE HONEST BOY,"Would turn to ask the reason why,"
1453,THE HONEST BOY,"The answer would be always this,"
1454,THE HONEST BOY,“Because he never tells a lie.”

1461,THE LIE,"That God who saw the thing she did,"
1462,THE LIE,From whom no action can be hid?
1463,THE LIE,Did she forget that God could see

1465,THE LIE,
1466,THE LIE,"He made our eyes, and can discern"
1467,THE LIE,Whichever way you think to turn;
1468,THE LIE,"He made our ears, and he can hear"
1469,THE LIE,Whene’er you think no one is near:
1470,THE LIE,"In every place, by night or day,"
1471,THE LIE,He watches all you do or say.
1472,THE LIE,
1473,THE LIE,"You thought because you were alone,"
1474,THE LIE,Your falsehood never could be known;
1475,THE LIE,"But liars always are found out,"
1476,THE LIE,Whatever way they wind about:
1477,THE LIE,"Then always be afraid, my dear,"

1508,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"Matilda was a pleasant child,"
1509,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"But one bad trick she had,"
1510,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,That e’en when all around her smiled
1511,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,Oft made her friends feel sad.
1512,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,
1513,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,Sometimes she’d lift the teapot-lid
1514,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,To peep at what was in it;
1515,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"Or tilt the kettle, if you did"
1516,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,But turn your head a minute.
1517,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,
1518,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"As grandmamma went out one day,"
1519,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,Her snuff-box and her specs
1520,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"She down upon the table lay,"
1521,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,Forgetting Tilly’s tricks.
1522,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,
1523,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,Immediately upon her nose
1524,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"She placed the glasses wide,"
1525,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"Then looking round, as I suppose,"
1526,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"The snuff-box, too, she spied."
1527,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,
1528,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"So thumb and finger went to work,"
1529,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,To move the stubborn lid;
1530,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"And as she gave it quite a jerk,"
1531,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,Much mischief then she did.
1532,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,
1533,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,The snuff came puffing in her face
1534,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"And eyes and nose and chin,"
1535,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"And as she ran about for ease,"
1536,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,The snuff got farther in.
1537,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,
1538,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,She dashed the spectacles away
1539,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,To wipe her tingling eyes;
1540,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"And there in twenty bits they lay,"
1541,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,As grandmamma she spies.
1542,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,
1543,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"She then, while smarting with the pain,"
1544,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,"Sneezing, and sick and sore,"
1545,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,Made many a promise to refrain
1546,MEDDLESOME MATTIE,From meddling any more.

2591,THE TURTLE-DOVES,The little turtle-dove
2592,THE TURTLE-DOVES,Made a pretty little nursery
2593,THE TURTLE-DOVES,To please her little love.
2594,THE TURTLE-DOVES,
2595,THE TURTLE-DOVES,"She was gentle, she was soft,"

2610,THE TURTLE-DOVES,The young turtle-doves
2611,THE TURTLE-DOVES,"Never quarreled in the nest,"

2663,THE PEACOCK,Although you can boast such a train;
2664,THE PEACOCK,For many a bird far more highly endowed
2665,THE PEACOCK,Is not half so conceited and vain.
2666,THE PEACOCK,
2667,THE PEACOCK,"Let me tell you, gay bird, that a suit of fine clothes"
2668,THE PEACOCK,"Is a sorry distinction at most,"

2671,THE PEACOCK,
2672,THE PEACOCK,"The nightingale certainly wears a plain coat,"
2673,THE PEACOCK,But she cheers and delights with her song;

2676,THE PEACOCK,
2677,THE PEACOCK,"The hawk cannot boast of a plumage so gay,"
2678,THE PEACOCK,But piercing and clear is her eye;

2681,THE PEACOCK,
2682,THE PEACOCK,"The dove may be clad in a plainer attire,"

2685,THE PEACOCK,Than all your fine purple and gold.
2686,THE PEACOCK,
2687,THE PEACOCK,"So you see, Mister Peacock, you must not be proud,"

2742,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,“Will you walk into my parlor?”
2743,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Said a spider to a fly;
2744,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,“’Tis the prettiest little parlor
2745,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,That ever you did spy.
2746,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,The way into my parlor
2747,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Is up a winding stair,"
2748,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And I have many pretty things
2749,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,To show when you are there.”
2750,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"“Oh, no, no,” said the little fly,"
2751,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,“To ask me is in vain;
2752,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"For who goes up your winding stair,"

2755,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,“I’m sure you must be weary

2757,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Will you rest upon my little bed?”
2758,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Said the spider to the fly.
2759,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"“There are pretty curtains drawn around,"
2760,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,The sheets are fine and thin;
2761,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And if you like to rest a while,"
2762,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,I’ll snugly tuck you in.”

2771,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,I’ve always felt for you?
2772,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"I have, within my pantry,"
2773,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Good store of all that’s nice;
2774,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,I’m sure you’re very welcome--
2775,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Will you please to take a slice?”
2776,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"“Oh, no, no,” said the little fly,"
2777,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"“Kind sir, that cannot be;"
2778,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"I’ve heard what’s in your pantry,"
2779,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And I do not wish to see.”

2794,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,The spider turned him round about
2795,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And went into his den,"
2796,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,For well he knew the silly fly
2797,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Would soon be back again;
2798,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,So he wove a subtle web
2799,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"In a little corner sly,"
2800,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And set his table ready
2801,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,To dine upon the fly.
2802,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"He went out to his door again,"
2803,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And merrily did sing,"

2805,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,With pearl and silver wing;
2806,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Your robes are green and purple,"
2807,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,There’s a crest upon your head;
2808,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Your eyes are like the diamond bright,"
2809,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,But mine are dull as lead.”
2810,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
2811,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Alas, alas! how very soon"
2812,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"This silly little fly,"
2813,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Hearing his wily, flattering words,"
2814,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Came slowly flitting by.
2815,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"With buzzing wings she hung aloft,"
2816,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Then near and nearer drew--
2817,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Thought only of her brilliant eyes
2818,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And green and purple hue;
2819,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Thought only of her crested head--
2820,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Poor foolish thing! At last
2821,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Up jumped the cunning spider
2822,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And fiercely held her fast.
2823,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
2824,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"He dragged her up his winding stair,"
2825,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Into his dismal den
2826,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Within his little parlor--but
2827,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,She ne’er came out again!
2828,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And now, dear little children"
2829,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Who may this story read,"

3060,MARY AND HER LAMB,"Then he ran to her, and laid"

3164,THE PET LAMB,"And looking o’er the hedge, before me I espied"
3165,THE PET LAMB,A snow-white mountain lamb with a maiden by its side.
3166,THE PET LAMB,
3167,THE PET LAMB,"Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone,"
3168,THE PET LAMB,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;
3169,THE PET LAMB,"With one knee on the grass did the little maiden kneel,"
3170,THE PET LAMB,While to that mountain lamb she gave its evening meal.
3171,THE PET LAMB,
3172,THE PET LAMB,"The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,"
3173,THE PET LAMB,Seemed to feast with head and ears; his tail with pleasure shook.
3174,THE PET LAMB,"“Drink, pretty creature, drink,” she said in such a tone"
3175,THE PET LAMB,That I almost received her heart into my own.
3176,THE PET LAMB,
3177,THE PET LAMB,"’Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!"
3178,THE PET LAMB,I watched them with delight; they were a lovely pair.
3179,THE PET LAMB,"Now with her empty can the maiden turned away,"
3180,THE PET LAMB,"But ere ten yards were gone, her footsteps did she stay."
3181,THE PET LAMB,
3182,THE PET LAMB,Right toward the lamb she looked; and from a shady place
3183,THE PET LAMB,"I, unobserved, could see the workings of her face."
3184,THE PET LAMB,"If nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,"
3185,THE PET LAMB,"Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little maid might sing:—"
3186,THE PET LAMB,
3187,THE PET LAMB,"“What ails thee, young one, what? Why pull so at thy cord?"
3188,THE PET LAMB,Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?
3189,THE PET LAMB,"Thy plot of grass is soft, as green as grass can be;"
3190,THE PET LAMB,"Rest, little young one, rest; what is’t that aileth thee?"
3191,THE PET LAMB,
3192,THE PET LAMB,“What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart?
3193,THE PET LAMB,"Thy limbs, are they not strong? and beautiful thou art."
3194,THE PET LAMB,"This grass is tender grass, these flowers they have no peers,"
3195,THE PET LAMB,And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears.
3196,THE PET LAMB,
3197,THE PET LAMB,"“If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woolen chain--"

3200,THE PET LAMB,The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.
3201,THE PET LAMB,
3202,THE PET LAMB,"“Rest, little young one, rest; thou hast forgot the day"
3203,THE PET LAMB,When my father found thee first in places far away;
3204,THE PET LAMB,"Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,"
3205,THE PET LAMB,And thy mother from thy side forevermore was gone.
3206,THE PET LAMB,
3207,THE PET LAMB,"He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home--"
3208,THE PET LAMB,A blessèd day for thee!--then whither wouldst thou roam?
3209,THE PET LAMB,A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean
3210,THE PET LAMB,Upon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been.
3211,THE PET LAMB,
3212,THE PET LAMB,“Thou knowst that twice a day I have brought thee in this can
3213,THE PET LAMB,"Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;"
3214,THE PET LAMB,"And twice within the day, when the ground is wet with dew,"

3217,THE PET LAMB,“Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now;

3220,THE PET LAMB,"Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold."
3221,THE PET LAMB,
3222,THE PET LAMB,"“It will not, cannot rest!--Poor creature, can it be"
3223,THE PET LAMB,That ’tis thy mother’s heart which is working so in thee?
3224,THE PET LAMB,"Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear,"
3225,THE PET LAMB,And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear.
3226,THE PET LAMB,
3227,THE PET LAMB,“Alas! the mountain-tops that look so green and fair!
3228,THE PET LAMB,I’ve heard of fearful winds and darkness that come there.
3229,THE PET LAMB,"The little brooks, that seem all pastime and all play,"
3230,THE PET LAMB,"When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey."
3231,THE PET LAMB,
3232,THE PET LAMB,“Here thou needst not dread the raven in the sky;
3233,THE PET LAMB,Both night and day thou’rt safe--our cottage is hard by.
3234,THE PET LAMB,Why bleat so after me? Why pull so at thy chain?
3235,THE PET LAMB,Sleep--and at break of day I will come to thee again.”

5468,CRADLE HYMN,Holy angels guard thy bed;
5469,CRADLE HYMN,Heavenly blessings without number
5470,CRADLE HYMN,Gently falling on thy head.
5471,CRADLE HYMN,
5472,CRADLE HYMN,Soft and easy is thy cradle;
5473,CRADLE HYMN,Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay
5474,CRADLE HYMN,"When his birthplace was a stable,"
5475,CRADLE HYMN,And his softest bed was hay.
5476,CRADLE HYMN,
5477,CRADLE HYMN,"See the kindly shepherds round him,"
5478,CRADLE HYMN,Telling wonders from the sky;
5479,CRADLE HYMN,"Where they sought him, there they found him,"
5480,CRADLE HYMN,With his virgin mother by.
5481,CRADLE HYMN,
5482,CRADLE HYMN,"Lo, he slumbers in the manger"
5483,CRADLE HYMN,Where the hornèd oxen fed!
5484,CRADLE HYMN,"Peace, my darling, here’s no danger,"
5485,CRADLE HYMN,Oxen stand not near thy bed.
5486,CRADLE HYMN,
5487,CRADLE HYMN,"Mayst thou live to know and fear him,"
5488,CRADLE HYMN,Trust and love him all thy days;
5489,CRADLE HYMN,"Then go dwell forever near him,"
5490,CRADLE HYMN,See his face and sing his praise!

5514,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"Oh, were you ne’er a schoolboy?"
5515,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"And did you never train,"
5516,YOUNG SOLDIERS,And feel the swelling of the heart
5517,YOUNG SOLDIERS,You ne’er will feel again?
5518,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"Did you never meet, far down the street,"
5519,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"With plumes and banners gay,"
5520,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"While the kettle, for the kettledrum,"
5521,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"Played your march, march away?"
5522,YOUNG SOLDIERS,
5523,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"It seems to me but yesterday,"
5524,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"Nor scarce so long ago,"
5525,YOUNG SOLDIERS,Since all our school their muskets took
5526,YOUNG SOLDIERS,To charge the fearful foe.
5527,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"Our muskets were of cedar-wood,"
5528,YOUNG SOLDIERS,With ramrod bright and new;
5529,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"With bayonet forever set,"
5530,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"And painted barrel, too."
5531,YOUNG SOLDIERS,
5532,YOUNG SOLDIERS,We charged upon a flock of geese
5533,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"And put them all to flight,"
5534,YOUNG SOLDIERS,
5535,YOUNG SOLDIERS,Except one sturdy gander
5536,YOUNG SOLDIERS,That thought to show us fight.
5537,YOUNG SOLDIERS,But ah! we knew a thing or two--
5538,YOUNG SOLDIERS,Our captain wheeled the van;
5539,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"We routed him, we scouted him,"
5540,YOUNG SOLDIERS,Nor lost a single man!
5541,YOUNG SOLDIERS,
5542,YOUNG SOLDIERS,Our captain was as brave a lad
5543,YOUNG SOLDIERS,As e’er commission bore;
5544,YOUNG SOLDIERS,And brightly shone his new tin sword;
5545,YOUNG SOLDIERS,A paper cap he wore.
5546,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"He led us up the steep hillside,"
5547,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"Against the western wind,"
5548,YOUNG SOLDIERS,While the cockerel plume which decked his head
5549,YOUNG SOLDIERS,Streamed bravely out behind.
5550,YOUNG SOLDIERS,
5551,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"We shouldered arms, we carried arms,"
5552,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"We charged the bayonet,"
5553,YOUNG SOLDIERS,And woe unto the mullein-stalk
5554,YOUNG SOLDIERS,That in our course we met.
5555,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"At two o’clock the roll we called,"
5556,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"And till the close of day,"
5557,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"With fearless hearts though tired limbs,"
5558,YOUNG SOLDIERS,We fought the mimic fray
5559,YOUNG SOLDIERS,"Till the supper-bell, from out the dell,"

5594,"HOW BIG WAS ALEXANDER, PA?",
5595,"HOW BIG WAS ALEXANDER, PA?","“And thousands of her people slew,"

5599,"HOW BIG WAS ALEXANDER, PA?",
5600,"HOW BIG WAS ALEXANDER, PA?",“A hundred conquered cities shone

5614,"HOW BIG WAS ALEXANDER, PA?",
5615,"HOW BIG WAS ALEXANDER, PA?","“Well, then, if I should kill a man,"
5616,"HOW BIG WAS ALEXANDER, PA?",I’d kill a hundred more;

5648,THE HEROIC BOY,"The boy stood on the burning deck,"
5649,THE HEROIC BOY,Whence all but him had fled;
5650,THE HEROIC BOY,The flames that lit the battled wreck
5651,THE HEROIC BOY,Shone round him o’er the dead.
5652,THE HEROIC BOY,
5653,THE HEROIC BOY,"Yet beautiful and bright he stood,"
5654,THE HEROIC BOY,As born to rule the storm;
5655,THE HEROIC BOY,"A creature of heroic blood,"
5656,THE HEROIC BOY,A brave though childlike form.
5657,THE HEROIC BOY,
5658,THE HEROIC BOY,The flames rolled on--he would not go
5659,THE HEROIC BOY,Without his father’s word;
5660,THE HEROIC BOY,"That father, faint in death below,"
5661,THE HEROIC BOY,His voice no longer heard.
5662,THE HEROIC BOY,
5663,THE HEROIC BOY,"He called aloud--“Say, father, say"
5664,THE HEROIC BOY,If yet my task is done!”
5665,THE HEROIC BOY,He knew not that the chieftain lay
5666,THE HEROIC BOY,Unconscious of his son.
5667,THE HEROIC BOY,
5668,THE HEROIC BOY,"“Speak, father!” once again he cried,"
5669,THE HEROIC BOY,“If I may yet be gone;”
5670,THE HEROIC BOY,"And but the booming shots replied,"
5671,THE HEROIC BOY,And fast the flames rolled on.
5672,THE HEROIC BOY,
5673,THE HEROIC BOY,"Upon his brow he felt their breath,"
5674,THE HEROIC BOY,"And in his waving hair,"
5675,THE HEROIC BOY,And looked from that lone post of death
5676,THE HEROIC BOY,In still yet brave despair;
5677,THE HEROIC BOY,
5678,THE HEROIC BOY,"And shouted but once more aloud,"
5679,THE HEROIC BOY,"“My father, must I stay?”"
5680,THE HEROIC BOY,"While o’er him fast, through sail and shroud,"
5681,THE HEROIC BOY,The wreathing fires made way.
5682,THE HEROIC BOY,
5683,THE HEROIC BOY,"They wrapped the ship in splendor wild,"
5684,THE HEROIC BOY,"They caught the flag on high,"
5685,THE HEROIC BOY,And streamed above the gallant child
5686,THE HEROIC BOY,Like banners in the sky.
5687,THE HEROIC BOY,
5688,THE HEROIC BOY,There came a burst of thunder-sound--
5689,THE HEROIC BOY,"The boy--oh, where was he?"
5690,THE HEROIC BOY,Ask of the winds that far around
5691,THE HEROIC BOY,"With fragments strewed the sea,"
5692,THE HEROIC BOY,
5693,THE HEROIC BOY,With mast and helm and pennon fair
5694,THE HEROIC BOY,That well had borne their part--
5695,THE HEROIC BOY,But the noblest thing that perished there
5696,THE HEROIC BOY,Was that young faithful heart.

5706,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"At the close of the pleasant day,"

5708,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Outside the door at play:
5709,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5710,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"“Come, Peter, come! I want you to go,"
5711,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"While there is light to see,"
5712,A STORY OF HOLLAND,To the hut of the blind old man who lives
5713,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Across the dike, for me."
5714,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And take these cakes I made for him--
5715,A STORY OF HOLLAND,They are hot and smoking yet;
5716,A STORY OF HOLLAND,You have time enough to go and come
5717,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Before the sun is set.”
5718,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5719,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Then the good wife turned to her labor,"
5720,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Humming a simple song,"
5721,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And thought of her husband, working hard"
5722,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"At the sluices all day long,"
5723,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And set the turf ablazing
5724,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And brought the coarse black bread,"
5725,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"That he might find a fire at night,"
5726,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And find the table spread.
5727,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5728,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And Peter left the brother
5729,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"With whom all day he had played,"
5730,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And the sister who had watched their sports
5731,A STORY OF HOLLAND,In the willow’s tender shade;
5732,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And told them they’d see him back before
5733,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"They saw a star in sight,"
5734,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Though he wouldn’t be afraid to go
5735,A STORY OF HOLLAND,In the very darkest night!
5736,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"For he was a brave, bright fellow,"
5737,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"With eye and conscience clear,"
5738,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"He could do whatever a boy might do,"
5739,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And he had not learned to fear.
5740,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Why, he wouldn’t have robbed a bird’s"
5741,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"nest,"
5742,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Nor brought a stork to harm,"
5743,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Though never a law in Holland
5744,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Had stood to stay his arm.
5745,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5746,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And now with his face all glowing,"
5747,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And eyes as bright as the day
5748,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"With the thoughts of his pleasant errand,"
5749,A STORY OF HOLLAND,He trudged along the way;
5750,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And soon his joyous prattle
5751,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Made glad a lonesome place;
5752,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Alas! if only the old blind man
5753,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Could have seen that happy face!
5754,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Yet he somehow caught the brightness
5755,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Which his voice and presence lent,"
5756,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And he felt the sunshine come and go
5757,A STORY OF HOLLAND,As Peter came and went.
5758,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5759,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And now, as the day was sinking"
5760,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And the winds began to rise,"
5761,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"The mother looked from her door again,"
5762,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Shading her anxious eyes.
5763,A STORY OF HOLLAND,She saw the shadows deepen
5764,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And birds to their homes come back,"
5765,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But never a sign of Peter
5766,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Along the level track.
5767,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"But she said: “He will come at morning,"
5768,A STORY OF HOLLAND,So I need not fret or grieve;
5769,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Though it isn’t like my boy at all
5770,A STORY OF HOLLAND,To stay without my leave.”
5771,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5772,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But where was the child delaying?
5773,A STORY OF HOLLAND,On the homeward way was he
5774,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And across the dike while the sun was up
5775,A STORY OF HOLLAND,An hour above the sea.
5776,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"He was stopping now to gather flowers,"
5777,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Now listening to the sound
5778,A STORY OF HOLLAND,As the angry waters dashed themselves
5779,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Against their narrow bound.
5780,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5781,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"“Oh, well for us,” said Peter,"
5782,A STORY OF HOLLAND,“That the gates are good and strong
5783,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And my father tends them carefully,"
5784,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Or they would not hold you long.
5785,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"You’re a wicked sea,” said Peter;"
5786,A STORY OF HOLLAND,“I know why you fret and chafe;
5787,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"You would like to spoil our lands and homes,"
5788,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But our sluices keep you safe.”
5789,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5790,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But hark! through the noise of waters
5791,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Comes a low, clear, trickling sound;"
5792,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And the child’s face pales with terror
5793,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And his blossoms drop to the ground.
5794,A STORY OF HOLLAND,He is up the bank in a moment
5795,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And, stealing through the sand,"
5796,A STORY OF HOLLAND,He sees a stream not yet so large
5797,A STORY OF HOLLAND,As his slender childish hand.
5798,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5799,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"‘_Tis a leak in the dike!_ He is but a boy,"
5800,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Unused to fearful scenes;
5801,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But young as he is he has learned to know
5802,A STORY OF HOLLAND,The dreadful thing that means.
5803,A STORY OF HOLLAND,A leak in the dike! The stoutest heart
5804,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Grows faint that cry to hear,"
5805,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And the bravest man in all the land
5806,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Turns white with mortal fear;
5807,A STORY OF HOLLAND,For he knows that the smallest leak may grow
5808,A STORY OF HOLLAND,To a flood in a single night;
5809,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And he knows the strength of the cruel sea
5810,A STORY OF HOLLAND,When loosed in its angry might.
5811,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5812,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And the boy! He has seen the danger,"
5813,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And shouting a wild alarm,"
5814,A STORY OF HOLLAND,He forces back the weight of the sea
5815,A STORY OF HOLLAND,With the strength of his single arm
5816,A STORY OF HOLLAND,He listens for the joyful sound
5817,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Of a footstep passing nigh;
5818,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"He lays his ear to the ground, to catch"
5819,A STORY OF HOLLAND,The answer to his cry.
5820,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And he hears the rough winds blowing
5821,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And the waters rise and fall,"
5822,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But never an answer comes to him
5823,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Save the echo of his call.
5824,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5825,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"He sees no hope, no succor,"
5826,A STORY OF HOLLAND,His feeble voice is lost;
5827,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Yet what shall he do but watch and wait
5828,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Though he perish at his post?
5829,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"So, faintly calling and crying"
5830,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Till the sun is under the sea,"
5831,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Crying and moaning till the stars
5832,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Come out for company,"
5833,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5834,A STORY OF HOLLAND,He thinks of his brother and sister
5835,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Asleep in their safe warm bed;
5836,A STORY OF HOLLAND,He thinks of his father and mother;
5837,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Of himself as dying--and dead;
5838,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And of how, when the night is over,"
5839,A STORY OF HOLLAND,They must come and find him at last;
5840,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But he never thinks he can leave the place
5841,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Where duty holds him fast.
5842,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5843,A STORY OF HOLLAND,The good dame in the cottage
5844,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Is up and astir with the light,"
5845,A STORY OF HOLLAND,For the thought of her little Peter
5846,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Has been with her all the night.
5847,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And now she watches the pathway
5848,A STORY OF HOLLAND,As yester eve she had done;
5849,A STORY OF HOLLAND,But what does she see so strange and black
5850,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Against the rising sun?
5851,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Her neighbors are bearing between them
5852,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Something straight to her door;
5853,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"Her child is coming home, but not"
5854,A STORY OF HOLLAND,As he ever came before.
5855,A STORY OF HOLLAND,
5856,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"“He is dead,” she cries, “my darling!”"
5857,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"And the startled father hears,"
5858,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And comes and looks the way she looks
5859,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And fears the thing she fears:
5860,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Till a glad shout from the hearers
5861,A STORY OF HOLLAND,Thrills the stricken man and wife--
5862,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"“Give thanks, for your son has saved our land"
5863,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And God has saved his life!”
5864,A STORY OF HOLLAND,So there in the morning sunshine
5865,A STORY OF HOLLAND,They knelt about the boy;
5866,A STORY OF HOLLAND,And every head was bared and bent
5867,A STORY OF HOLLAND,"In tearful, reverent joy."
