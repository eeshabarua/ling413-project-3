52,“HOW MAMA USED TO PLAY.”,_There was once a very happy little girl who spent her childhood on an

63,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,
64,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"One of my pet playhouses was an old stump, out in the pasture. Such a"
65,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"dear, old stump as it was, and so large I could not put my arms more"
66,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,than half way round it!
67,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,
68,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,Some of its roots were partly bare of earth for quite a little distance
69,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"from the stump, and between these roots were great green velvety moss"
70,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,cushions.
71,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,
72,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"On the side, above the largest moss cushion, was a little shelf where a"
73,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,bit of the stump had fallen away. On this little shelf I used to place a
74,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,little old brass candlestick. I used to play that that part of the stump
75,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,was my parlor.
76,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,
77,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,Above the next moss cushion were a number of shelves where I laid pieces
78,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,of dark-blue broken china I had found and washed clean in the brook.
79,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,That was my dining-room.
80,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,
81,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,There were two or three little bedrooms where the puffy moss beds were
82,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"as soft as down. My rag dolly had many a nap on those little green beds,"
83,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,all warmly covered up with big sweet-smelling ferns.
84,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,
85,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,Then there was the kitchen! Hardly any moss grew there. I brought little
86,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"white pebbles from the brook, and made a pretty, white floor. Into the"
87,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"side of the stump above this shining floor, I drove a large nail. On"
88,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,this nail hung the little tin pan and iron spoon with which I used to
89,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,mix up my mud pies.
90,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,
91,I.—THE LITTLE STUMP-HOUSE.,"My sister had a stump much like mine, and such fine times as the owners"

132,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.
133,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,
134,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,There was an old apple-tree in the orchard that was the oldest tree in
135,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"the town. It overtopped the house, and the trunk was very big and brown"
136,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"and rough; but O, the millions of fine green leaves, as soft and smooth"
137,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"as silk, that it held up in the summer air!"
138,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,
139,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"In the spring it was gay with pink and white blossoms, and then for days"
140,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"the tree would be all alive with the great, black-belted bees. A little"
141,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"later those sweet blossoms would fall off in a rosy rain, and Myra and I"
142,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"would stand under the old apple-tree and try to catch the little,"
143,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"fluttering things in our apron! And then, later still, came little"
144,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"apples, very sour at first, but slowly sweetening until it seemed to me"
145,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"that those juicy, golden-green apples tasted the best of any fruit in"
146,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,all the world! My apron-pockets were always bursting with them!
147,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,
148,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,There was a famous horse up in the old tree. It could only be reached by
149,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,means of a ladder placed against the old tree’s stout trunk! A strange
150,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"horse, you would call him, but O, the famous rides that I have had on"
151,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"that horse’s broad, brown back! The name of the horse was “General.”"
152,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,
153,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,Up among the leaves where the sunshine played hide-and-seek was one dear
154,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,bough that was just broad enough and just crooked enough to form a nice
155,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,seat. Another bough bent round just in the very place to form a most
156,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"comfortable back to that seat. A pair of stirrups made of rope, some"
157,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"rope reins tied to the trunk of the tree, and there was my horse, “all"
158,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,saddled and all bridled!”
159,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,
160,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"I put my feet into the stirrups, shake my bridle-reins and cry, “Get up,"
161,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,General!”
162,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,
163,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"The bough would sway a little, and I and the birds would be off"
164,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"together, swinging and singing, up in a fair green world where there was"
165,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"no one to disturb nest or little rider! The birds would sing to me, and"
166,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"I would sing to them, and which of those little singers was the"
167,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,"happiest, I do not know!"
168,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,
169,II.-THE OLD APPLE-TREE.,But I do know that my little heart was full of glee and joy to the brim!

183,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,
184,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,Little Mary had had a volume of Hans Andersen’s Fairy Stories given her
185,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"at Christmas. The story she liked best was “The Princess and the Pea,”"
186,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"for, like all little girls, little Mary had a natural desire to be a"
187,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,Princess.
188,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,
189,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,When she went to bed at night with her doll little Mary would think to
190,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"herself, “Oh, how beautiful to be a real princess of such very fine"
191,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,blood as to feel a little bit of a pea under twenty mattresses!”
192,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,
193,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"One morning a comforting idea came to little Mary. “Who knows,” she said"
194,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"to herself, “with all my very many great grandfathers and grandmothers,"
195,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,but p’raps I am related to some King or Queen way back?”
196,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,
197,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"Thereupon, she went to her mother’s pantry and took a bean from the"
198,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"jar—as large a one as she could find—and, going to her room, put it"
199,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"carefully under the hair mattress. That night she went to bed happy,"
200,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,with joyful hopes.
201,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,
202,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,In the morning little Mary’s elder sister found her with her head buried
203,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"in her pillow crying. “Oh,” little Mary sobbed, “I did think I might"
204,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"have just a little speck of royal blood in my veins, but I couldn’t feel"
205,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,even that big bean under just one mattress!”
206,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,
207,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,Nothing would comfort little Mary until her mama explained to her that
208,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,even princesses were not happy unless they had good hearts; and _she_
209,SHE WISHED TO BE A PRINCESS.,"could have, if she tried, just as good and royal a heart as any Princess"

221,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
222,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"Out in the pasture, was a little pond. This little pond was quite deep"
223,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,in the time of the spring and autumn rains. At such seasons Myra and I
224,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"would take our little raft made of boards, and by means of some stout"
225,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,sticks would push the raft around on that little pond for hours. The
226,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"wind would raise little waves, and these waves would splash up against"
227,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,the sides of our little raft with a delicious sort of noise.
228,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
229,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,We used to dress a smooth stick of wood in doll’s clothes. We used to
230,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,call this wooden dolly by the name of Mrs. Pippy. We would take Mrs.
231,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"Pippy on board our ship as passenger. Somehow, Mrs. Pippy always"
232,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"contrived to fall overboard. And then, such screaming, such frantic"
233,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"pushing of that raft as there would he, before that calmly-floating Mrs."
234,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,Pippy was rescued!
235,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
236,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,Just beyond the further edge of the pond was a little swampy place where
237,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,great clumps of sweet-flag used to grow. Sweet-flag is a water-plant
238,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"whose leaves are very long and slender and their stem-ends, where they"
239,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"wrap about each other, are good to eat. In summer this little sweet-flag"
240,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,swamp was perfectly dry. But when the rains had come and the little pond
241,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"was full, this little sweet-flag swamp was covered with water."
242,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
243,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"Right between the pond and the swamp lay a big timber, stretching away"
244,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"like a narrow bridge, with the pond-water lapping it on one side and the"
245,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,swamp-water lapping it on the other. Such exciting times as we used to
246,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,have running across that little bridge after sweet-flag!
247,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
248,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"“Run! run!” we would cry to each other; and then, away we would go,"
249,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"running like the wind, yet very carefully, for the least misstep was"
250,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,sure to plump us into the water!
251,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
252,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"When the water in the swamp had nearly dried up, a bed of the very"
253,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"nicest kind of mud was left. Taking off our shoes and stockings, we"
254,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,would dance in that sticky mud until we were tired. Then we would hop
255,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,over the timber and wash our small toes clean in the pond.

268,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,See how funnily he is drinking the milk with his paw. Did you know this
269,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"cat, mamma?”"
270,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
271,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"“Yes, my dear, I was staying at the house when his mistress found him"
272,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"out. We used to wonder sometimes why there was so little milk for tea,"
273,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"and my friend would say ‘They must drink it in the kitchen, for the neck"
274,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"of the milk jug is so narrow, Tom could not get his great head in.’"
275,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
276,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,“But Tom was too clever to be troubled at the narrow neck of the milk or
277,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"cream jug, and one day when his mistress was coming towards the parlor"
278,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"through the garden, she saw Tom on the table from the window, dipping"
279,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,his paw into the jug like a spoon and carrying the milk to his mouth.
280,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"Did he not jump down quickly, and hide himself when she walked in, for"

288,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,“Did you ever see Tom drink the milk in this way?”
289,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,
290,III.—THE LITTLE POND.,"“Yes, for his mistress was proud of his cleverness, and she would place"

334,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,
335,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,We had a merry playmate in a little brook that ran down through the

339,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,

351,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,up on one of its little mossy stones. Once I did slip and sat right down

354,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,
355,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,"Now and then, I would fasten a bent pin to a string and tie the string"

360,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,
361,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,"Sometimes, I would take a big white chip and load it with pebbles or"

368,IV.—THE LITTLE BROOK.,"A great green frog with big, staring eyes watched from the side of the"

386,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,Another place where I played was out on the meadow-rocks. Right down in
387,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,a level spot in the meadow were three great rocks. Each one of these
388,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,rocks was as large as a dining-room table. Right through this little
389,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"flat place ran the brook I have told you about, bubbling round our three"
390,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,great rocks.
391,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,
392,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"0, what splendid playhouses those rocks were! We each owned one. The"
393,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"third was owned by that wooden doll, Mrs. Pippy. In order to get to"
394,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,either one of the houses you had to cross a little bridge that spanned a
395,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,tiny river. Also there were dear little steps up the sides of the rocks
396,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,which it was such a pleasure to go up and down.
397,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,
398,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"On the top of the rocks, which were almost as flat as the top of a"
399,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"table, were little closely-clinging patches of moss that we called our"
400,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,rugs. There were queer-shaped hollows in the tops of these rocks. In one
401,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,little moss-lined hollow I used to cradle my baby-doll. Another hollow
402,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,was my kitchen sink. I used to fill up my sink with bits of broken
403,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"dishes, turn on some water from the brook, and then such a scrubbing as"
404,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,my dishes got!
405,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,
406,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"At the rocks, kneeling down on the planks that formed our bridges, we"
407,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,used to wash our dollies’ clothes. Then we would spread them on the
408,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,grass to dry. Didn’t we use to keep our babies clean and sweet!
409,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,
410,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"Afterwards, pinning our short skirts up about us, we would wash the"
411,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,floors of our little rock houses until they shone. When everything was
412,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"spick-and-span, we would unpin our skirts, pull down our sleeves, rub"
413,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"our rosy cheeks with a mullein leaf to make them rosier, and with a big"
414,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,burdock leaf tied on with a couple of strings for a bonnet we would go
415,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,"calling on our lazy neighbor, Mrs. Pippy, and give her a serious"
416,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,“talking-to.”
417,V.—THE MEADOW-ROCKS.,

447,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
448,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
449,_THE SNOW WITCH._,There was skating on the ponds where the snow had been cleared; there
450,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"were icicles on the trees, nice blue, clear skies in the daytime, cold,"
451,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"bright, wintry moonlight at night."
452,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
453,_THE SNOW WITCH._,Lovely weather for Christmas holidays! But to one little five-year-old
454,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"man, nothing had seemed lovely this Christmas, though he was spending it"
455,_THE SNOW WITCH._,with his Father and Mother and his big sisters at Grandpapa’s beautiful
456,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"old country house, where everybody did all that could be done to make"
457,_THE SNOW WITCH._,Grandpapa’s guests happy. For poor little Roger was pining for his elder
458,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"brother, Lawson, whom he had not seen for more than four months. Lawson"
459,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"was eight, and had been at school since Michaelmas, and there he had"
460,_THE SNOW WITCH._,caught a fever which had made it not safe for him to join the rest of
461,_THE SNOW WITCH._,the family till the middle of January. But he was coming to-morrow.
462,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
463,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"Why, then, did Roger still look sad and gloomy?"
464,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
465,_THE SNOW WITCH._,“Stupid little boy!” said Mabel. “I’m sure we’ve tried to amuse him.
466,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"Why, Mamma let him sit up an hour later than usual last night, to hear"
467,_THE SNOW WITCH._,all those funny old fairy tales and legends Uncle Bob was telling.”
468,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
469,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"“Yes, and weren’t they fun?” answered Pansy. “I did shiver at the witch"
470,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"ones, though, didn’t you?”"
471,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
472,_THE SNOW WITCH._,Poor little Roger! Pansy’s shivering was nothing to his! They had all
473,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"walked home from the vicarage, tempted by the clear, frosty moonlight"
474,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"and the hard, dry ground; and trotting along, a little behind the"
475,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"others, a strange thing had happened to the boy. Fancy—in the field by"
476,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"the Primrose Lane, through the gateway, right in a bright band of"
477,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"moonlight, _he had seen a witch_. Just such a witch as Uncle Bob had"
478,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"described—with shadowy garments, and outstretched arms, and a"
479,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"queer-shaped head, on all of which the icicles were sparkling, just as"
480,_THE SNOW WITCH._,Uncle Bob had said. For it was a winter-witch he had told the story
481,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"about, whose dwelling was up in the frozen northern seas—“the Snow"
482,_THE SNOW WITCH._,Witch” they called her.
483,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
484,_THE SNOW WITCH._,[Illustration]
485,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
486,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"Cold as it was, Roger was in a bath of heat, his heart beating wildly,"
487,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"his legs shaking, when he overtook his sisters. And the night that"
488,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"followed was full of terrible dreams and starts and misery, even though"
489,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"nurse and baby were next door, and he could see the night-light through"
490,_THE SNOW WITCH._,the chinks. If it had not been that Lawson was coming—Lawson who never
491,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"laughed at him or called him “stupid little goose,” Lawson who listened"
492,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"to all his griefs—Roger could not have borne it. For, strange to say,"
493,_THE SNOW WITCH._,the little fellow told no one of his trouble; he felt as if he could
494,_THE SNOW WITCH._,_only_ tell Lawson.
495,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
496,_THE SNOW WITCH._,No wonder he looked pale and sad and spiritless; there was still another
497,_THE SNOW WITCH._,dreadful night to get through before Lawson came.
498,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
499,_THE SNOW WITCH._,But things sometimes turn out better than our fears. Late that
500,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"afternoon, when nursery tea was over and bedtime not far off, there came"
501,_THE SNOW WITCH._,the sound of wheels and then a joyful hubbub. Lawson had come! Uncle Bob
502,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"had been passing near the school where he was, and had gone a little out"
503,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"of his way to pick him up. Every one was delighted—oh, of them all,"
504,_THE SNOW WITCH._,_none_ so thankful as Roger.
505,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
506,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"“Though I wont tell him to-night,” decided the unselfish little fellow,"
507,_THE SNOW WITCH._,“not to spoil his first night. I sha’n’t mind when I know he’s in his
508,_THE SNOW WITCH._,cot beside me.” And even when Lawson lovingly asked him if anything was
509,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"the matter, he kept to his resolution."
510,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
511,_THE SNOW WITCH._,But he woke in the middle of the night from a terrible dream; Lawson
512,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"woke too, and then—out it all came."
513,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
514,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"“I thought she was coming in at the window,” Roger ended. “If—if you"
515,_THE SNOW WITCH._,look out—it’s moonlight—I think _p’r’aps_ you’ll see where she stands.
516,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"But no, no! Don’t, _don’t_! She might see you.”"
517,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
518,_THE SNOW WITCH._,So Lawson agreed to wait till to-morrow.
519,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
520,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"“I have an idea,” said Lawson. “Roger, darling, go to sleep. _I’m_ here,"
521,_THE SNOW WITCH._,and you can say your prayers again if you like.”
522,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
523,_THE SNOW WITCH._,Lawson was up very early next morning. And as soon as breakfast was over
524,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"he told Roger to come out with him. Down the Primrose Lane they went, in"
525,_THE SNOW WITCH._,spite of Roger’s trembling.
526,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
527,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"“Now, shut your eyes,” said Lawson, when they got to the gate. He opened"
528,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"it, and led his brother through."
529,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
530,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"“Look, now!” he said, with a merry laugh. And what do you think Roger"
531,_THE SNOW WITCH._,saw?
532,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
533,_THE SNOW WITCH._,[Illustration]
534,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
535,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"An old scarecrow, forgotten since last year. There she stood, the “Snow"
536,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"Witch,” an apron and ragged shawl, two sticks for arms, a bit of"
537,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"Grandpapa’s hat, to crown all—that was the witch!"
538,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
539,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"“Shake hands with her, Roger,” said Lawson. And shake hands they both"
540,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"did, till the old scarecrow tumbled to pieces, never more to frighten"
541,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"either birds or little boys. “Dear Lawson,” said Roger, lovingly, as he"
542,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"held up his little face for a kiss. And happy, indeed, were the rest of"
543,_THE SNOW WITCH._,the Christmas holidays.
544,_THE SNOW WITCH._,
545,_THE SNOW WITCH._,"May they never love each other less, these two; may they be true"

556,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
557,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Well, first of all, I must tell you that I am a Brownie, and although I"
558,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"am ever and ever so old, I look as young to-day as I did when I was but"
559,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"one year old. Well, it was about seven hundred years ago, and I used to"
560,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"be a great deal with some other Brownies, cousins of mine, visiting at"
561,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"the same farm-houses as they did, and helping them with their work. And"
562,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"it was in this way that I got to know the Three Blind Mice,—Purrin,"
563,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Furrin, and Tod."
564,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
565,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Pretty, pleasant little fellows they were; and they were not blind"

568,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
569,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Such merry supper-parties as never were, I think, before or since, we"
570,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,used to have then. We would think nothing of finishing a round of apple
571,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"and a walnut-shell full of honey between us, in one evening, to say"
572,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,nothing of scraps of cheese-rind and the crumbs we stole from the birds.
573,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Purrin had a most melodious voice, and could sing a good song, while Tod"
574,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"was never at a loss for an amusing story. As to Furrin, he was almost as"
575,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"quaint as our Mr. Puck, and, though perhaps it is not for _me_ to say"
576,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"so, when those in high places do encourage him, not one-tenth as"
577,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,mischievous.
578,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
579,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"When Angelina, the old stable cat, had kittens, he would get into all"
580,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"sorts of out-of-the-way places, and imitate their squeaky little voices,"
581,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"so that she was always on the fidget, thinking she must have mislaid one"
582,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"somewhere, and never able to find it. For you see, as she could not"
583,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"count, she never knew whether they were all beside her or no. Often he"
584,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"would coax a whole hazel-nut out of Rudge, the Squirrel, who lived on"
585,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"the Hanger, just above, and whom every one believed to be a miser. And"
586,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"then his Toasting-fork Dance was so sprightly and graceful, it did your"
587,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"heart good to see it. Ah, me! those days are gone, and Furrin is gone"
588,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"too; and the Moon, when she looks through that chink in the barn roof,"
589,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,no longer sees us feasting and making merry on the great beam.
590,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
591,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,And this is how they became blind:
592,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
593,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,[Illustration]
594,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
595,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"They were very fond of Gilliflower, Dame Marjoram’s little daughter, and"
596,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"after the nurse had put her to bed, Furrin, Purrin, and Tod used to"
597,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"creep up into her room, and read her some of the funny little tales from"
598,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,Mouse-land till she went to sleep. She would lie there with her eyes
599,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"shut, and perhaps imagined that it was her own thoughts that made her"
600,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,fancy all about the fairy tales that came into her head; but really it
601,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"was the mice who read them to her, but in such a low voice that"
602,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,Gilliflower never thought of opening her eyes to see if any one was
603,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"there. I must tell you that the print in Mouse-land is very, very small"
604,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,and hard to read. This did not matter so much during the long Summer
605,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"evenings, when there was plenty of light to see to read by; but when the"
606,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Winter came on, and the mice had only the firelight to read by, then"
607,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,reading the small print began to tell its tale. You know how bad it is
608,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"for the eyesight to read any print by firelight, and it must be very"
609,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,much worse when the print is very small; and so Furrin would say to
610,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Purrin, “My eyes are getting quite dim, so now you must read;” and"
611,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"before Purrin had read a page he would say the same thing to Tod, and"
612,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,then Tod would try; but after a time their eyes became so dim they
613,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"couldn’t see at all, and so they had to invent stories to tell little"
614,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Gilliflower; so the poor little mice went quite blind, trying to amuse"
615,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,their little girl friend.
616,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
617,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,I took what care of them I could; but their blindness was very sad for
618,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,them. No longer had Purrin the heart to sing or Furrin to dance and
619,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"jest. Only they would sit close together, each holding one of Tod’s"
620,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"hands, and listening to his stories, for he kept his spirits best, and"
621,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"did all he could to cheer the others. All the marketing fell to me then,"
622,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"and it gave me plenty to do; for, poor souls, the only amusement left"
623,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"them was a dainty morsel, now and then."
624,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
625,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"And, by and by, they became so tired of sitting still, when Tod had"
626,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"exhausted all his stock of stories, that they got reckless, and would go"
627,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"blundering about the house after Dame Marjoram, whom they knew by the"
628,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"rustle of her silken skirt, and the tapping of her high-heeled shoes."
629,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"They all ran after her, forgetting, that although they could not see"
630,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"her, still she could see them, and trying to follow her into her"
631,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"store-room, where the almonds, and raisins, and sugar, and candied-peel"

638,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"I told them she would get angry, and that harm would come of it; but I"
639,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"think their unhappiness and dulness made them quite foolhardy, for they"
640,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"still went on, getting under her feet, and well-nigh tripping her up;"
641,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"clambering into the lard-pot before her very eyes; in short, doing a"
642,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"thousand irritating and injudicious things day by day, until her"
643,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"patience was quite worn out. And at last, when they scrambled on to the"
644,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"dinner-table, thinking it to be the store-room shelf, and sat all in a"
645,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"row, quietly eating out of Miss Gilliflower’s plate, Dame Marjoram, who"
646,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"had the carving-knife in her hand, thought it high time for them to have"
647,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"a lesson in manners. So, thinking the knife was turned blunt side"
648,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"downwards, she rapped them smartly across their three tails. What was"
649,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"her horror and their dismay, to find them cut off quite cleanly. The"
650,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"little tails lay still on the table, and the three little mice,"
651,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"well-nigh crazed with terror and pain, groped their way off the table"
652,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,and out of the room.
653,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
654,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"I was returning from the cheese-room, and met them crossing the great"
655,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,hall.
656,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
657,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"Of course, I took in at a glance all that had occurred, and I must say"
658,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"that I felt but little surprise, though much sorrow. I guided them to"
659,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,our old haunt in the loft-roof and then sat down to prepare a Memorial
660,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"for Dame Marjoram, giving a full account of all that they had suffered"

663,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,[Illustration]
664,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,
665,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,This I placed on the top of the key-basket; and while she was reading
666,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"it, with my usual tact I silently brought in Purrin, Furrin, and Tod,"
667,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,and pushed them forward in front of her.

669,_THE STORY TOLD BY A BROWNIE._,"The tears stood in her eyes as she finished reading my scroll, and from"

696,VI—THE LILACS.,There was a great clump of lilac bushes out by the garden wall. These
697,VI—THE LILACS.,lilacs grew close together and made a thick hedge nearly around a little
698,VI—THE LILACS.,"plot of ground, where the grass grew so thick and velvety that it was"
699,VI—THE LILACS.,"like a great green rug, and they bent their tall heads over this little"
700,VI—THE LILACS.,"green plot, and so formed a lovely summer-house."
701,VI—THE LILACS.,
702,VI—THE LILACS.,"Here we used to sew for our dolls, and here we used to give tea-parties."
703,VI—THE LILACS.,Raspberry shortcake was one of the dainties we used to have. This is the
704,VI—THE LILACS.,"way we made it: Take a nice clean raspberry leaf, heap it with"
705,VI—THE LILACS.,"raspberries, and put another leaf on top. Eat at once."
706,VI—THE LILACS.,
707,VI—THE LILACS.,In this lovely summer-house I used to keep school. I had a row of bricks
708,VI—THE LILACS.,for scholars. Each brick had its own name. Two or three of the bricks
709,VI—THE LILACS.,were nice and red and new. I named those new bricks after my dearest
710,VI—THE LILACS.,little school-friends.
711,VI—THE LILACS.,
712,VI—THE LILACS.,The rest of the bricks were either broken or blackened a little. Those
713,VI—THE LILACS.,"bricks were my naughty, idle scholars. I used to stand them up in a row"
714,VI—THE LILACS.,to learn their lessons. The first thing I knew those bad bricks would
715,VI—THE LILACS.,all tumble down in a heap. Numbers of little lilac-switches grew about
716,VI—THE LILACS.,"my schoolhouse, and I fear I was a severe teacher."
717,VI—THE LILACS.,
718,VI—THE LILACS.,"When the lilacs were in bloom, that dear little summer-house was a very"
719,VI—THE LILACS.,"gay little place. The great, purple plumes would nod in every little"
720,VI—THE LILACS.,wind that blew. The air was full of sweetness. Butterflies made the
721,VI—THE LILACS.,trees bright with their slowly-waving wings. There was a drowsy hum of
722,VI—THE LILACS.,many bees. Sometimes we would catch hold of one of the slender trunks of
723,VI—THE LILACS.,"the lilac trees, and give it a smart shake. Away would flash a bright"
724,VI—THE LILACS.,"cloud of butterflies, and a swarm of angry, buzzing bees!"
725,VI—THE LILACS.,
726,VI—THE LILACS.,"Pleasant Sabbath afternoons, we used to take our Sunday-school books out"
727,VI—THE LILACS.,under the lilacs to read. And as we read about good deeds and unselfish
728,VI—THE LILACS.,"lives, our own choir of birds would sing sweet hymns. Then we would look"
729,VI—THE LILACS.,"up and smile, and say, “They have good singing at the lilac church,"
730,VI—THE LILACS.,don’t they?”

797,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"There was neither dust nor dirt in it—nothing but clean, fine sand, with"
798,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"now and then a pebble. It was not high, so there was no danger of a"
799,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,great mass of sand falling down on us two children.
800,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,
801,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,The sand-bank was not very far from the little brook. Myra and I would
802,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"carry pailful after pailful of water from the brook to it, until we had"
803,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,moistened a large quantity of sand. Sometimes we would cover our little
804,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"bare feet with the cool, wet sand, packing it just as close as we could."
805,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"Then gently, O, so gently, we would pull our feet out from under the"
806,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"sand. The little “five-toed caves” as we used to call them, would show"
807,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"just as plain as could be, where our little feet had been! We used to"
808,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"catch little toads and put them into those little damp caves, but they"
809,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,would soon hop out.
810,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,
811,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,We used to make the nicest pies and cakes and cookies out of that lovely
812,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,wet sand. We used to wish our sand-dainties were fit to eat!
813,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,
814,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"Oftentimes, when we were tired of cooking, we would go to work and lay"
815,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"out a wonderful garden with tiny flower-beds and winding paths, out of"
816,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"that wet sand. Some of those flower-beds were star-shaped, some were"
817,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"round as a wheel, and some were square. We used to gather handfuls of"
818,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"wild-flowers and stick them down in, until every tiny bed blossomed into"
819,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,pink and blue and white and gold!
820,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,
821,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,We used to make sand-preserves out there. The time and the patience that
822,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,we used up in filling narrow-necked bottles with sand! After a bottle
823,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"was well-filled and shaken down, we would catch up that bottle and run"
824,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,down to the brook. We would wash the outside of that bottle until it
825,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,"shone like cut-glass, and then we would pack it away in a hollow stump"
826,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,that we called our preserve-closet.
827,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,
828,VII.—THE SAND-BANK.,We used to play a game that we called “Hop-scotch” out in the old

845,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,I used to play a great deal out in the old pasture. It had a clump of
846,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,cradle-knolls in it. A cradle-knoll is a little mound of moss.
847,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,
848,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,"On these mossy little cradle-knolls, checkerberry leaves and berries"
849,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,used to grow. How delicious those spicy young checkerberry leaves
850,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,tasted! And we hunted those red plums as a cat hunts a mouse!
851,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,
852,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,"The pasture had two or three well-beaten paths in it, that the cows had"
853,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,made by their sober steady tramping back and forth from the barnyard
854,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,lane to the growth of little trees and bushes and tender grass at the
855,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,"back. At sunset-time, two little barefooted girls would “spat” along"
856,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,those cool smooth winding paths after those cows.
857,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,
858,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,As long as we kept in the paths our little feet were all right. But
859,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,"sometimes a clump of bright wild-flowers tempted us, and then two sorry"
860,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,little girls with thistle-prickles in their feet would come limping
861,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,"back. But out where the tender grasses grew there were no thistles, and"
862,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,such fun as hide-and-seek used to be among the bushes!
863,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,
864,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,Sometimes we could not find the cows very readily; and then we would

867,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,
868,VIII.—THE OLD PASTURE.,"In the spring, we would go a-maying out in the old pasture, and O, such"

1047,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"children delighted in them, and picked them in baskets-full, and made"
1048,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,daisy-chains to their hearts’ content. There were several children who
1049,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"lived in this pleasant farmhouse, for Tic-tac-too had many brothers and"
1050,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,sisters. The old-fashioned nursery was all that a modern nursery should
1051,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"be; it had deep cupboards for toys, and each child had his or her wide"
1052,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,shelf to keep special treasures on; and the window-ledges were cosey
1053,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"places to curl up in on wet days, when the rain beat outside, and the"
1054,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"wind sighed, and even the daisies looked as if they did not like to be"
1055,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,washed so much.

1059,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Some of the children at Daisy Farm were old enough to have governesses
1060,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"and masters, to have a schoolroom for themselves, and, in short, to have"
1061,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,very little to say to the nursery; but still there were four nursery
1062,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,little ones; and one day mother electrified the children by telling them
1063,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,that another little boy was coming to pay them a visit.
1064,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1065,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“He is coming to-morrow,” said mother; “he is a year younger than Alec"
1066,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"here, but his mother has asked us to take care of him. You must all be"
1067,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"kind to the little baby stranger, children, and try your very best to"
1068,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"make him feel at home. Poor little man, I trust he will be happy with"
1069,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,us.”
1070,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1071,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,[Illustration]
1072,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1073,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Mother sighed as she spoke; and when she did this, Rosie, the eldest"
1074,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"nursery child, looked up at her quickly. Rosie had dark gray eyes, and a"
1075,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,very sympathetic face; she was the kind of child who felt everybody’s
1076,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"troubles, and nurse said she did this far more than was good for her."
1077,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1078,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"The moment her mother left the room, Rosie ran up to her nurse, and"
1079,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,spoke eagerly—
1080,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1081,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Why did mother sigh when she said a new little boy was coming here,"
1082,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,nursie?”
1083,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1084,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Oh, my love, how can I tell? People sigh most likely from habit, and"
1085,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"from no reason whatever. There’s nothing to fret anybody in a sigh, Miss"
1086,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Rosie.”
1087,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1088,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“But mother doesn’t sigh from habit,” answered Rosie; “I expect there’s"
1089,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"going to be something sad about the new little boy, and I wonder what it"
1090,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"is. Harry, shall we collect some of our very nicest toys to have ready"
1091,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,for the poor little new boy?”
1092,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1093,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Harry was six; he had a determined face, and was not so generous as"
1094,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Rosie.
1095,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1096,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“I’ll not give away my skin-horse,” he said, “so you needn’t think it,"
1097,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,nor my white dog with the joints; there are some broken things down in
1098,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,that corner that he can have. But I don’t see why a new baby should have
1099,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"my best toys. Gee-up, Alec! you’re a horse, you know, and I’m going to"
1100,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,race you from one end of the nursery to the other—now trot!”
1101,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1102,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Fat little curly-headed Alec started off good-humoredly, and Rosie"
1103,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,surveyed her own shelf to see which toys would most distract the
1104,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,attention of the little stranger.
1105,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1106,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"She was standing on a hassock, and counting her treasures over"
1107,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"carefully, when she was startled by a loud exclamation from nurse."
1108,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1109,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,“Mercy me! If that ain’t the telegraph boy coming up the drive!”
1110,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1111,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Nurse was old-fashioned enough still to regard telegrams with
1112,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,apprehension. She often said she could never look at one of those awful
1113,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"yellow envelopes, without her heart jumping into her mouth; and these"
1114,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"fears she had, to a certain extent, infected the children with."
1115,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1116,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Harry dropped Alec’s reins, and rushed to the window; Rosie forgot her"
1117,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"toys, and did likewise; Jack and Alec both pressed for a view from"
1118,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,behind.
1119,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1120,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Me, me, me, me want to see!” screamed baby Alec from the back."
1121,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1122,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Nurse lifted him into her arms; as she did so, she murmured under her"
1123,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"breath,—"
1124,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1125,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,“God preserve us! I hope that awful boy isn’t bringing us anything bad.”
1126,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1127,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Rosie heard the words, and felt a sudden sense of chill and anxiety; she"
1128,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"pressed her little hand into nurse’s, and longed more than ever to give"
1129,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,all the nicest toys to the new little boy.
1130,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1131,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Just then the nursery door was opened, and Kate, the housemaid,"
1132,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"appeared, carrying the yellow envelope daintily between her finger and"
1133,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,thumb.
1134,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1135,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“There, nurse,” she said, “it’s for you; and I hope, I’m sure, it’s no"
1136,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,ill-luck I’m bringing you.”
1137,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1138,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Oh, sake’s alive!” said nurse. “Children, dears, let me sit down. That"
1139,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"awful boy to bring it to me! Well, the will of the Lord must be done;"
1140,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"whatever’s inside this ugly thing? Miss Rosie, my dear, could you hunt"
1141,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,round somewhere for my spectacles?”
1142,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1143,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"It always took a long time to find nurse’s spectacles; and Rosie, after"
1144,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"a frantic search, in which she was joined by all the other nursery"
1145,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"children, discovered them at last at the bottom of Alec’s cot. She"
1146,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"rushed with them to the old woman, who put them on her nose, and began"
1147,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,deliberately to read the contents of her telegram.
1148,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1149,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,The children stood round her as she did so. They were all breathless and
1150,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,excited; and Rosie looked absolutely white from anxiety.
1151,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1152,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Well, my dears,” said nurse at last, when she had spelt through the"
1153,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"words, “it ain’t exactly a trouble; far from me to say that; but all the"
1154,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"same, it’s mighty contrary, and a new child coming here, and all.”"
1155,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1156,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“What is it, nurse?” said Harry. “_Do_ tell us what it’s all about.”"
1157,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1158,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“It’s my daughter, dears,” said nurse; “she’ll be in London to-morrow,"
1159,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,on her way back to America.”
1160,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1161,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Oh, nurse!” said Rosie, “not your daughter Ann?”"
1162,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1163,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,[Illustration]
1164,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1165,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“The same, my love; she that has eight children, and four of them with"
1166,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"carrotty hair. She wants me to go up to London, to see her to-morrow;"
1167,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"that’s the news the telegraph boy has brought, Miss Rosie. My daughter"
1168,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Ann says, ‘Mother, meet me to-morrow at aunt’s, at two o’clock.’ Well,"
1169,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"well, it’s mighty contrary; and that new child coming, and all!”"
1170,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1171,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“But you’ll have to go, nurse. It would be dreadful for your daughter"
1172,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Ann not to see you again.”
1173,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1174,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Yes, dear, that’s all very fine; but what’s to become of all you"
1175,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,children? How is this blessed baby to get on without his old Nan?”
1176,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1177,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Oh, nurse, you _must_ go! It would be so cruel if you didn’t,”"
1178,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,exclaimed Rosie.
1179,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1180,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Nurse sat thinking hard for a minute or two; then saying she would go
1181,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"and consult her mistress, she left the room."
1182,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1183,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"The upshot of all this was, that at an early hour the following morning"
1184,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"nurse started for London, and a girl, of the name of Patience, from the"
1185,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"village, came up to take her place in the nursery."
1186,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1187,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Mrs. Rogers was particularly busy during these days. She had some
1188,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"friends staying with her, and in addition to this her eldest daughter,"
1189,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Ethel, was ill, and took up a good deal of her mother’s time; in"
1190,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,consequence of these things the nursery children were left entirely to
1191,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,the tender mercies of Patience.
1192,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1193,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Not that that mattered much, for they were independent children, and"
1194,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"always found their own amusements. The first day of nurse’s absence,"
1195,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"too, was fine, and they spent the greater part of it in the open air;"
1196,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,but the second day was wet—a hopelessly wet day—a dull day with a
1197,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"drizzling fog, and no prospect whatever of clearing up."
1198,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1199,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,The morning’s post brought a letter from nurse to ask for further leave
1200,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"of absence; and this, in itself, would have depressed the spirits of the"
1201,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"nursery children, for they were looking forward to a gay supper with"
1202,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"her, and a long talk about her daughter Ann, and all her London"
1203,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,adventures.
1204,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1205,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,[Illustration]
1206,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1207,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,But this was not the real trouble which pressed so heavily on Rosie’s
1208,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,motherly heart; the real anxiety which made her little face look so
1209,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"careworn was caused by the new baby, the little boy of two years old,"
1210,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"who had arrived late the night before, and now sat with a shadow on his"
1211,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"face, absolutely refusing to make friends with any one."
1212,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1213,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"He must have been a petted little boy at home, for he was beautifully"
1214,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"dressed, and his curly hair was nicely cared for, and his fair face had"
1215,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"a delicate peach bloom about it; but if he was petted, he was also,"
1216,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"perhaps, spoilt, for he certainly would not make advances to any of his"
1217,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"new comrades, nor exert himself to be agreeable, nor to overcome the"
1218,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"strangeness which was filling his baby mind. Had nurse been at home, she"
1219,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,would have known how to manage; she would have coaxed smiles from little
1220,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Fred, and taken him up in her arms, and “mothered” him a good bit."
1221,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Babies of two require a great lot of “mothering,” and it is surprising"
1222,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,what desolation fills their little souls when it is denied them.
1223,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1224,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Fred cried while Patience was dressing him; he got almost into a passion
1225,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"when she washed his face, and he sulked over his breakfast. Patience was"
1226,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,not at all the sort of girl to manage a child like Fred; she was rough
1227,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"in every sense of the word; and when rough petting failed, she tried the"
1228,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,effect of rough scolding.
1229,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1230,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Come, baby, come, you _must_ eat your bread and milk. No nonsense now,"
1231,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"open your mouth and gobble it down. Come, come, I’ll slap you if you"
1232,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,don’t.”
1233,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1234,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"But baby Fred, though sorrowful, was not a coward; he pushed the bowl of"
1235,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"bread and milk away, upset its contents over the clean tablecloth, and"
1236,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,raised two sorrowful big eyes to the new nurse’s face.
1237,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1238,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Naughty dirl, do away,” he said; “Fred don’t ’ove ’oo. Fred won’t eat"
1239,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,bekfus’.”
1240,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1241,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,[Illustration]
1242,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1243,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Oh, Miss Rosie, what a handful he is!” said Patience."
1244,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1245,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,“Let me try him!” said Rosie; “I’ll make him eat something. Come Freddy
1246,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"darling, you love Rosie, don’t you?”"
1247,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1248,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“No, I don’t,” said Fred."
1249,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1250,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Well, you’ll eat some breakfast; come now.”"
1251,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1252,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,“I won’t eat none bekfus’—do away.”
1253,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1254,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Rosie turned round and looked in a despairing way at her own three
1255,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,brothers.
1256,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1257,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,“If only nurse were at home!” she said.
1258,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1259,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Master Fred,” said Patience, “if you won’t eat, you must get down from"
1260,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"the breakfast-table. I have got to clear up, you know.”"
1261,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1262,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,She popped the little boy on the floor. He looked round in a bewildered
1263,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,fashion.
1264,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1265,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Let’s have a very exciting kind of play, and perhaps he’ll join in,”"
1266,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"said Rosie, in a whisper. “Let’s play at kittens—that’s the loveliest of"
1267,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,all our games.”
1268,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1269,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Kittens” was by no means a quiet pastime. It consisted, indeed, in wild"
1270,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"romps on all-fours, each child assuming for the time the character of a"
1271,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"kitten, and jumping after balls of paper, which they caught in their"
1272,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,mouths.
1273,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1274,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“It’s the happiest of all our games, and perhaps he’ll like it,” said"
1275,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Rosie.
1276,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1277,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Patie,” said Alec, going up to the new nurse, “does ’oo know"
1278,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,_Tic-tac-too_?”
1279,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1280,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Of course I do, master Baby—a silly game that.”"
1281,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1282,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“I ’ike it,” said little Alec."
1283,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1284,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"He tripped across the nursery to the younger baby, and sat down by his"
1285,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,side.
1286,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1287,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Take off ’oo shoe,” he said."
1288,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1289,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Fred was very tired of being cross and miserable. He could not say he
1290,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"was too little to Alec, for Alec was scarcely bigger than himself."
1291,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Besides he understood about taking off his shoe. It was a performance he
1292,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"particularly liked. He looked at Baby Alec, and obeyed him."
1293,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1294,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Take off ’oo other shoe,” said Alec."
1295,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1296,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Fred did so.
1297,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1298,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Pull off ’oo ’tocks,” ordered the eldest baby."
1299,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1300,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Fred absolutely chuckled as he tugged away at his white socks, and"
1301,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,revealed his pink toes.
1302,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1303,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Now, come to Patie.”"
1304,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1305,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Fred scrambled to his feet, and holding Alec’s hand, trotted down the"
1306,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,long nursery.
1307,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1308,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Patie,” said Alec, “take F’ed on ’our lap, and play _Tic-tac-too_ for"
1309,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,him?”
1310,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1311,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,[Illustration]
1312,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1313,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,Patience was busy sewing; she raised her eyes. Two smiling little
1314,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"baby-boys were standing by her knee. Could this child, whose blue eyes"
1315,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"were full of sunshine, be the miserable little Fred?"
1316,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1317,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Well, master Alec,” she said, kissing the older baby, “you’re a perfect"
1318,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"little darling. Well, I never! to think of you finding out a way to"
1319,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,please that poor child.”
1320,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1321,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Tic-tac-too!” said Fred, in a loud and vigorous voice. He was fast"
1322,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"getting over his shyness, and Alec’s game suited him to perfection."
1323,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1324,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,But the little stranger did _not_ like the game of kittens. He marched
1325,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"in a fat, solid sort of way across the nursery, and sat down in a"
1326,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"corner, with his back to the company. Here he really looked a most"
1327,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,dismal little figure. The view of his back was heart-rending; his curly
1328,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"head drooped slightly, forlornness was written all over his little"
1329,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,person.
1330,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1331,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,“What a little muff he is!” said Harry; “I’m glad I didn’t give my skin
1332,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,horse to him.”
1333,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1334,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Oh, don’t,” said Rosie, “can’t you see he’s unhappy? I must go and"
1335,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"speak to him. Fred,” she said, going up to the child, “come and play"
1336,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,with Alec and me.”
1337,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1338,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,[Illustration]
1339,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1340,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“No,” said Fred, “I’se too little to p’ay.”"
1341,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1342,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“But we’ll have such an easy play, Fred. _Do_ come; I wish you would.”"
1343,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1344,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“I’se too little,” answered Fred, shaking his head again."
1345,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1346,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,At that moment Rosie and her two elder brothers were called out of the
1347,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,room to their morning lessons. Rosie’s heart ached as she went away.
1348,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1349,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"“Something must be done,” she said to herself. “That new little boy-baby"
1350,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,will get quite ill if we can’t think of something to please him soon.”
1351,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1352,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,She did not know that a very unexpected little deliverer was at hand.
1353,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"The two babies were now alone in the nursery, and Patience, having"
1354,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"finished her tidying up, sat down to her sewing."
1355,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,
1356,_TIC-TAC-TOO._,"Patience lifted him on her lap, popped him down with a bounce, kissed"

1376,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,
1377,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,We used to play a great deal about the pasture fence. It was a high rail
1378,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,fence and we used to take a little pole in both hands as a balancing
1379,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"pole, and run along on the top. Carefully we balanced ourselves as we"
1380,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"ran! But finally we would tip first one way and then the other, and"
1381,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"then, with a little laughing scream, off we’d topple!"
1382,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,
1383,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,Sometimes we would put a board through the fence and have a fine time at
1384,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"“seesaw.” Up one of us would go, high in the air, and down would go the"
1385,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,other with a thud!
1386,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,
1387,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,We used to play that the pasture fence was a huge cupboard. Each rail
1388,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,was a shelf. Many of those rail-shelves were loaded down with bits of
1389,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"broken dishes, shining pebbles, bits of green moss that we called"
1390,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"“pincushions,” and white clam-shells full of strawberries, or"
1391,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"raspberries, or little dark juicy choke-cherries. The contents of the"
1392,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,clam-shells were for the birds. If we found a clam-shell lying on the
1393,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"ground, we believed with all our little hearts that a little winged"
1394,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,creature had been fed from our cupboard.
1395,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,
1396,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,Sometimes we would carry on a thriving millinery store out at the
1397,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,pasture fence. We would make queer little bonnets out of birch-bark.
1398,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,Then we would sew wildflowers on the bonnets and lay them on the rails
1399,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,of the fence for sale. Such a number of those funny little bonnets as
1400,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,would be on exhibition on our rail-counters!
1401,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,
1402,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,One of the big upright posts of our rail fence was hollow a little way
1403,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,down. One day we found on the ground a nest full of birdlings; one of
1404,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"them was dead, and a little green snake had almost reached the nest. The"
1405,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,mother-bird was flying about crying pitifully. I snatched the nest away
1406,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,"and carried it O, so carefully to the pasture fence and put it down in"
1407,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,the hollow of the fence-post. Then we went a bit away and waited. Pretty
1408,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,soon there was a little rush of wings; and soon the mother-bird settled
1409,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,down in that hollow post just as cunning as could be. And that dear
1410,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,little family staid in that hollow post until the baby-birds grew up and
1411,X.—THE PASTURE FENCE.,flew away.

1429,LULU’S FIRST THANKSGIVING.,They do not have a Thanksgiving Day down in Cuba. That is how Lulu did
1430,LULU’S FIRST THANKSGIVING.,not have one until she was six years old.

1434,LULU’S FIRST THANKSGIVING.,the day at her grandfather’s. It did not take them long to get

1458,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"We had a number of rainy-day playhouses. When it did not rain very hard,"
1459,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"Myra and I would scamper out to our little playhouse made of boards, and"
1460,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,listen to the patter of the drops.
1461,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,
1462,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,It was not a very costly playhouse. It was built in a corner made by the
1463,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,shed and the orchard fence. One side of our playhouse was the shed.
1464,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,Another side was the fence; this open side we used to call our
1465,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,bay-window. A creeping hop vine twined around the rough fence-boards and
1466,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,made a green lace curtain for our bay-window. The third side was made of
1467,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"boards. Across this side stretched the wide board seat, which was the"
1468,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"only furniture of our playhouse. The fourth, or front side of the"
1469,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"playhouse consisted mostly of a “double-door,” of which we were very"
1470,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,proud. This double-door was two large green blinds. Did not we feel like
1471,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,truly little housekeepers when we fastened those two blinds together
1472,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,with a snap!
1473,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,
1474,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,When the rain came down in gentle showers we used to go out to the
1475,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,little playhouse and have a concert. First Myra would step up on to that
1476,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,wide board seat and recite a little piece. Then I would step up on to
1477,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,the seat and sing a little song. Perhaps while I was singing a robin in
1478,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"the orchard would begin to sing, O, so loud and sweet that all the"
1479,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,orchard just rang with that sweet music! We would stop our concert and
1480,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"listen to the robin. When he had finished, we used to clap our little"
1481,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"hands. And all the time the rain kept up a fairy “tinkle, tinkle,” as if"
1482,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,some one was keeping time for us on a tiny piano.
1483,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,
1484,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,Spat-t! Spat-t! would come the little drops through a tiny hole in the
1485,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,roof of our little house. We used to hold our faces up towards that
1486,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,little leak in the roof. Oftentimes a drop would strike us fairly on the
1487,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,tip of our small noses! Then how we would laugh!
1488,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,
1489,XI.—OUR RAINY-DAY PLAYHOUSE.,"Sometimes we would take hold of hands and repeat together, over and over"

1505,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,
1506,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,In winter we played everywhere! The whole white world was a lovely
1507,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"playground! We had no skates, but we wore very thick-soled boots that"
1508,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"took the place of skates very well. At least we thought so, and that was"
1509,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,all we needed to make us contented. When the little pond was frozen
1510,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"over, we would take a quick run down its snowy banks and then we would"
1511,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,skim clear across that little pond’s frozen surface just as swift as a
1512,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,bird would skim through the air.
1513,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,
1514,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,Sometimes a thick frost would come in the night-time. The next morning a
1515,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,fine blue haze would be in the air and everything would be clothed in
1516,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,soft white frost-furs. As the sun rose higher and higher we would watch
1517,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,to see the trees and bushes grow warm in the sunshine and throw off
1518,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,their furs. Then we would try and catch those soft furs as they fell.
1519,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,But if caught they melted quickly away.
1520,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,
1521,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,If the surface of the snow hardened enough so that we could walk on the
1522,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"crust without breaking through, our happiness was complete. High hills"
1523,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"were all about us, and it seemed to us as if every shining hill would"
1524,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"say if it could, “Come and slide!”"
1525,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,
1526,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"And O, the happy hours that we have had with our clumsy old sled! Away"
1527,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"we would go, the wind stinging our faces until crimson roses blossomed"
1528,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"in our cheeks, and the shining crust snapping and creaking under our"
1529,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"sled, and the hill flying away behind us!"
1530,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,
1531,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"If a damp clinging snow came, it made lovely snowballs; and it was such"
1532,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,fun to catch hold of the long clothes-lines and shake them and see
1533,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,little clumps of snow hop like rabbits from the line into the air.
1534,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,
1535,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"And if instead of warmth, and great damp feathery snowflakes, there came"
1536,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,a bitter wind and an icy sleet that froze as it fell—what then? Never
1537,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,mind! Sunrise would set the whole world a-sparkle. Every tree and bush
1538,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,would be gay with splendid ice-jewels! And in the great shining ice
1539,XII.—THE WHOLE WHITE WORLD.,"palace, we could run and laugh and shout, watching the ice-jewels loosen"

1554,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"It was Uncle George who called her “Gran’ma” when she was only six, and"
1555,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"by the time she was seven everybody had taken to the name, and she"
1556,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,answered to it as a matter of course.
1557,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1558,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Why did he call her so? Because she was such a prim, staid, serious,"

1560,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to dressing her in an old-fashioned way, so that at last, whether she"
1561,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"was out in the grounds, or round by the stables with Grant, in her"
1562,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"figured pink dress, red sash, long gloves, and sun-bonnet, looking after"

1564,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"apron—with pockets, of course, and quaint mob cap tied up with its"

1567,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“It is her nature to,” Uncle George said, quoting from “Let dogs"

1569,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"wonderingly in the most quaint way, and then put her hand in his, and"
1570,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,ask him to take her for a walk.
1571,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1572,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Gran’ma lived in a roomy old house with a delightful garden, surrounded"
1573,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,by a very high red-brick wall that was covered in the spring with white
1574,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"blossoms, and in the autumn with peaches with red cheeks that laughed at"
1575,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"her and imitated hers; purple plums covered with bloom, and other plums"
1576,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,that looked like drops of gold among the green leaves; and these used to
1577,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"get so ripe and juicy in the hot sun, that they would crack and peer out"
1578,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,at her as if asking to be eaten before they fell down and wasted their
1579,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,rich honey juice on the ground. Then there were great lumbering looking
1580,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"pears which worried John, the gardener, because they grew so heavy that"
1581,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"they tore the nails out of the walls, and had to be fastened up"
1582,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,again—old John giving Gran’ma the shreds to hold while he went up the

1585,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"That garden was Gran’ma’s world, it was so big; and on fine mornings she"

1587,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"sister, up this way, down that, under the apple-trees, along the"
1588,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"gooseberry and currant alleys, teaching her and Grant that it was not"

1590,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Dinnywinkle, who was always bubbling over with fun, did as the serious"
1591,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"little thing told her in the most obedient of ways, and helped her to"

1596,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"For Grant, whose papa was a setter, and mamma a very lady-like"
1597,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"retriever, always had ideas in his head that there were wild beasts"
1598,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"hiding in the big garden, and as soon as his collar was unfastened, and"
1599,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"he was taken down the grounds for a run, he seemed to run mad. His ears"
1600,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"went up, his tail began to wave, and he dashed about frantically to hunt"
1601,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"for those imaginary wild beasts. He barked till he was hoarse sometimes,"
1602,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"when after a good deal of rushing about he made a discovery, and would"
1603,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"then look up triumphantly at Gran’ma, and point at his find with his"
1604,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"nose, till she came up to see what he had discovered. One time it would"
1605,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"be a snail, at another a dead mouse killed by the cat, and not eaten"
1606,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"because it was a shrew. Upon one occasion, when the children ran up, it"
1607,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,was to find the dog half wild as he barked to them to come and see what
1608,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"he was holding down under his paw,—this proving to be an unfortunate"
1609,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,frog which uttered a dismal squeal from time to time till Gran’ma set it
1610,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"at liberty, so that it could make long hops into a bed of ivy, where it"
1611,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"lived happily long afterwards, to sit there on soft wet nights under a"

1617,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"silky ears, with the prisoner making no effort to escape."
1618,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1619,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,But the job was to catch him; and on these occasions Gran’ma used to run
1620,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"and run fast, while Dinny ran in another direction to cut Grant off."
1621,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1622,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,[Illustration]
1623,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1624,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"And a pretty chase he led them, letting them get close up, and then"
1625,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"giving a joyous bark and leaping sidewise, to dash off in quite a fresh"
1626,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"direction. Here he would perhaps hide, crouching down under one of the"
1627,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"shrubs, ready to pounce out on his pursuers, and then dash away again,"
1628,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"showing his teeth as if he were laughing, and in his frantic delight"
1629,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,waltzing round and round after his tail. Then away he would bound on to

1631,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,Dinny laughing and clapping her hands to see him play one of his
1632,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"favorite tricks, which was to lay his nose down close to the grass,"
1633,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"first on one side and then on the other, pushing it along as if it was a"
1634,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"plough, till he sprang up and stood barking and wagging his tail, as"
1635,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"much as to say, “What do you think of that for a game?” ending by"
1636,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"running helter-skelter after a blackbird which flew away, crying"

1649,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Wuph!” said Grant, and he took hold of the basket in his teeth, and"

1653,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Here, if Dinny was what Gran’ma called “a good girl,” she had a treat."

1670,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1671,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Gran’ma said she would, and the hutch was wheeled round by the stables,"
1672,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Grant following and looking very much puzzled, for though he never"
1673,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"hunted the cats now, rabbits did seem the right things to kill."
1674,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1675,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"But Gran’ma soon taught him better, and he became the best of friends"
1676,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"with Brown Downie and her two children, Bunny and White Paws."
1677,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1678,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"In fact, one day there was a scene, for Cook rushed into the schoolroom"
1679,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"during lesson time, out of breath with excitement."
1680,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1681,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Please’m, I went down the garden, ’m, to get some parsley, and that"
1682,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"horrid dog’s hunting the rabbits, and killing ’em.”"
1683,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1684,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"There was a cry from both children, and Gran’ma rushed out and round to"
1685,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"the stables, to find the hutch door unfastened, and the rabbits gone,"
1686,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"while, as she turned back to the house with the tears running down her"
1687,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"cheeks, who should come trotting up but Grant, with his ears cocked, and"
1688,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,Bunny hanging from his jaws as if dead.
1689,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1690,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Gran’ma uttered a cry; and as Mamma came up with Dinny, the dog set the"
1691,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"little rabbit down, looked up and barked, and Bunny began loping off to"
1692,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"nibble the flowers, not a bit the worse, while Grant ran and turned him"
1693,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"back with his nose, for Gran’ma to catch the little thing up in her"
1694,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,arms.
1695,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1696,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Grant barked excitedly, and ran down the garden again, the whole party"
1697,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"following, and in five minutes he had caught White Paw."
1698,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1699,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Dinny had the carrying of this truant, and with another bark, Grant"
1700,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"dashed in among the gooseberry bushes, where there was a great deal of"
1701,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"rustling, a glimpse of something brown, and then of a white cottony"
1702,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,tail. Then in spite of poor Grant getting his nose pricked with the
1703,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"thorns, Brown Downie was caught and held by her ears till mamma lifted"
1704,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"her up, and she was carried in triumph back, Grant trotting on before,"
1705,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"and leading the way to the stable-yard and the hutch, turning round"
1706,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,every now and then to bark.
1707,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1708,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"The rabbits did not get out again, and every morning and evening they"
1709,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,were fed as regularly as Gran’ma fed herself.
1710,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1711,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"On reaching the hutch, Grant set the basket down, leaving the handle"
1712,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"rather wet, though he could easily have wiped it with his ears, and then"
1713,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"he sat down in a dreamy way, half closing his eyes and possibly thinking"
1714,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,about wild rabbits on heaths where he could hunt them through furze
1715,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"bushes, while Gran’ma in the most serious way possible opened the hutch"

1717,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1718,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,[Illustration]
1719,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1720,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"There was no difficulty about catching White Paw, for he was ready"
1721,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"enough to thrust his nose into his little mistress’s hand, and be lifted"
1722,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"out by his ears, and held for Dinny to stroke."
1723,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1724,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Now let me take him,” she cried."
1725,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1726,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“No, my dear, you are too young yet,” said Gran’ma; and Dinny had to be"
1727,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"content with smoothing down White Paw’s soft brown fur, as it nestled up"
1728,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"against its mistress’s breast, till it was put back kicking, and"
1729,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"evidently longing to escape from its wooden-barred prison, even if it"
1730,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,was to be hunted by Grant.
1731,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1732,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Then Bunny had his turn, and was duly lifted out and smoothed; after"
1733,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"which, Brown Downie, who was too heavy to lift, gave the floor of the"
1734,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"hutch a sharp rap with one foot, making Grant lift his ear and utter a"
1735,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,deep sigh.
1736,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1737,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“No,” he must have thought; “it’s very tempting, but I must not seize"
1738,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,her by the back and give her a shake.”
1739,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1740,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Then the trough was filled with oats, the door fastened, and the girls"
1741,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"looked on as three noses were twitched and screwed about, and a low"
1742,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,munching sound arose.
1743,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1744,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Three rabbits and a dog! Enough pets for any girl, my reader; but"
1745,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Gran’ma had another—Buzz, a round, soft-furred kitten with about as much"
1746,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,fun in it as could be squeezed into so small a body. But Buzz had a
1747,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"temper, possibly soured by jealousy of Grant, whom he utterly detested."
1748,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1749,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Buzz’s idea of life was to be always chasing something,—his tail, a"
1750,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"shadow, the corner of the table-cover, or his mistress’s dress. He liked"
1751,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to climb, too, on to tables, up the legs, into the coal-scuttle, behind"
1752,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"the sideboard, and above all, up the curtains, so as to turn the"
1753,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"looped-up part into a hammock, and sleep there for hours. Anywhere"
1754,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"forbidden to a respectable kitten was Buzz’s favorite spot, and"
1755,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"especially inside the fender, where the blue tiles at the back reflected"
1756,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"the warmth of the fire, and the brown tiles of the hearth were so bright"
1757,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"that he could see other kittens in them, and play with them, dabbing at"
1758,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,them with his velvet paw.
1759,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1760,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Buzz had been dragged out from that forbidden ground by his hind leg,"
1761,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"and by the loose skin at the back of his neck, and he had been punished"
1762,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"again and again, but still he would go, and strange to say, he took a"
1763,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,fancy to rub himself up against the upright brass dogs from the tip of
1764,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"his nose to the end of his tail, and then repeat it on the other side."
1765,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1766,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,But Gran’ma’s pet did not trespass without suffering for it. Both his
1767,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"whiskers were singed off close, and there was a brown, rough,"
1768,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"ill-smelling bit at the end of his tail where, in turning round, he had"
1769,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"swept it amongst the glowing cinders, giving him so much pain that he"
1770,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"uttered a loud “Mee-yow!” and bounded out of the room, looking up at"
1771,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,Gran’ma the while as if he believed that she had served him like that.
1772,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1773,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,[Illustration]
1774,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1775,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"In Gran’ma’s very small old-fashioned way, one of her regular duties was"
1776,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to get papa’s blue cloth fur-lined slippers, and put them against the"
1777,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"fender to warm every night, ready for him when he came back tired from"
1778,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"London; and no sooner were those slippers set down to toast, than Buzz,"
1779,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"who had been watching attentively, went softly from his cushion where he"
1780,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"had been pretending to be asleep, but watching all the time with one"
1781,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"eye, and carefully packed himself in a slipper, thrusting his nose well"
1782,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"down, drawing his legs right under him, and snoozling up so compactly"
1783,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"that he exactly fitted it, and seemed part of a fur cushion made in the"
1784,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,shape of a shoe.
1785,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1786,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,But Buzz was not allowed to enjoy himself in that fashion for long. No
1787,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"sooner did Gran’ma catch sight of what he had done than she got up, went"
1788,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to the fireplace, gravely lifted the slipper, and poured Buzz out on to"
1789,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"the hearth-rug, replaced the slipper where it would warm, and went back,"
1790,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to find, five minutes later, that the kitten had fitted himself into the"
1791,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"other slipper, with only his back visible, ready to be poured out again."
1792,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Then, in a half-sulky, cattish way, Buzz would go and seat himself on"
1793,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"his square cushion, and watch, while, to guard them from any more such"
1794,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"intrusions, Gran’ma picked up the slippers and held them to her breast"
1795,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,until such time as her father came home.
1796,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1797,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Those were joyous times at the old house, till one day there was a"
1798,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,report spread in the village that little Gran’ma was ill. The doctor’s
1799,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"carriage was seen every day at the gate, and then twice a day, and there"
1800,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,were sorrow and despair where all had been so happy. Dinny went alone
1801,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,with Grant to feed the rabbits; and there were no more joyous rushes
1802,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"round the garden, for the dog would lie down on the doorstep with his"
1803,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"head between his paws, and watch there all day, and listen for the quiet"
1804,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"little footstep that never came. Every day old John, the gardener,"
1805,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,brought up a bunch of flowers for the little child lying fevered and
1806,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"weak, with nothing that would cool her burning head, and three anxious"
1807,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,faces were constantly gazing for the change that they prayed might come.
1808,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1809,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,For the place seemed no longer the same without those pattering feet.
1810,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,Cook had been found crying in a chair in the kitchen; and when asked
1811,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"why, she said it was because Grant had howled in the night, and she knew"
1812,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,now that dear little Gran’ma would never be seen walking so sedately
1813,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,round the garden again.
1814,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1815,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,It was of no use to tell her that Grant had howled because he was
1816,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,miserable at not seeing his little mistress: she said she knew better.
1817,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1818,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Don’t tell me,” she cried; “look at him.” And she pointed to where the"
1819,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"dog had just gone down to the gate, for a carriage had stopped, and the"
1820,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"dog, after meeting the doctor, walked up behind him to the house, waited"
1821,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"till he came out, and then walked down behind him to the gate, saw him"
1822,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"go, and came back to lie down in his old place on the step, with his"
1823,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,head between his paws.
1824,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1825,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"They said that they could not get Grant to eat, and it was quite true,"
1826,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,for the little hands which fed him were not there; and the house was
1827,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"very mournful and still, even Dinny having ceased to shout and laugh,"
1828,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"for they told her she must be very quiet, because Gran’ma was so ill."
1829,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1830,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"From that hour Dinny went about the place like a mouse, and her favorite"
1831,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"place was on the step by Grant, who, after a time, took to laying his"
1832,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"head in her lap, and gazing up at her with his great brown eyes."
1833,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1834,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"And they said that Gran’ma knew no one now, but lay talking quickly"
1835,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,about losing the rabbits and about Dinny and Grant; and then there came
1836,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"a day when she said nothing, but lay very still as if asleep."
1837,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1838,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,[Illustration]
1839,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1840,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"That night as the doctor was going, he said softly that he could do no"
1841,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"more, but that those who loved the little quiet child must pray to God"
1842,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to spare her to them; and that night, too, while tears were falling"
1843,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"fast, and there seemed to be no hope, Grant, in his loneliness and"
1844,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"misery, did utter a long, low, mournful howl."
1845,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1846,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"But next morning, after a weary night, those who watched saw the bright"
1847,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"glow of returning day lighting up the eastern sky, and the sun had not"
1848,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"long risen before Gran’ma woke as if from a long sleep, looked up in her"
1849,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"mother’s eyes as if she knew her once more, and the great time of peril"
1850,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,was at an end.
1851,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1852,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,All through the worst no hands but her mother’s had touched her; but now
1853,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"a nurse was brought in to help—a quiet, motherly, North-country woman"
1854,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"who one day stood at the door, and held up her hands in astonishment,"
1855,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"for she had been busy down-stairs for an hour, and now that she had"
1856,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,returned there was a great reception on the bed: Buzz was seated on the
1857,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,pillow purring; the rabbits all three were playing at the bed being a
1858,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"warren, and loping in and out from the valance; Grant was seated on a"
1859,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,chair with his head close up to his mistress’s breast; and Dinny was
1860,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"reading aloud from a picture storybook like this, but the book was"
1861,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"upside down, and she invented all she said."
1862,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1863,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,“Bless the bairn! what does this mean?” cried nurse.
1864,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1865,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"It meant that Dinny had brought up all Gran’ma’s friends, and that the"

1878,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"A, just for fun, because it is of so small a matter, but it was a"
1879,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"sunshiny matter for it caused some smiling, and it brought out real"

1881,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1882,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,“Mr. Pingry goes in on the 8.17 train and attends to his furnace the
1883,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"last thing, allowing twelve minutes to reach the station. When about"
1884,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"half-way there, yesterday, it occurred to him that he forgot to shut the"
1885,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"drafts. Just then he met Jerry Snow, the man at the Binney place, and"
1886,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"asked him to please call round our way, and ask for Mrs. Pingry, and say"
1887,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,Mr. Pingry had left the drafts open. Jerry said he would after going to
1888,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"the post-office, but Mr. Pingry, fearing Jerry might forget, called"
1889,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"hastily at the door of Madam Morey, an elderly woman who does plain"
1890,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"sewing, and said he forgot to shut the furnace drafts; if she should see"
1891,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"a boy passing would she ask him to call at our door, and ask for Mrs."
1892,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"Pingry, and tell her? Madam said she would be on the lookout for a boy,"
1893,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,while doing her baking.
1894,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1895,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Now as Mr. Pingry was hurrying on, it came to him that he had not yet"
1896,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"made a sure thing of it, and at that moment he saw the woman who does"
1897,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"chore-work at the Binney’s, coming by a path across the field. He met"
1898,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"her at the fence, and asked if she would go around by our house and say"
1899,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to Mrs. Pingry that Mr. Pingry had left the drafts all open. She agreed,"
1900,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"and Mr. Pingry ran to his train, a happy man."
1901,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1902,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Now Madam Morey felt anxious about the furnace, and stepped often to"
1903,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"the window, and at last spied a small boy with a sled, and finding he"
1904,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"knew where we live, told him Mr. Pingry went away and forgot to shut the"
1905,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"furnace drafts and wished to send back word, and would the boy coast"
1906,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"down that way and tell Mrs. Pingry? The boy promised, and coasted down"
1907,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,the hill.
1908,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1909,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Madam Morey still felt uneasy about the furnace, and not being sure the"
1910,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,boy would do the errand kept on the watch for another; and when the
1911,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,banana-man stopped and made signs at her window ‘would she buy?’ she
1912,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,wrote a few words on a bit of brown paper and went with him far enough
1913,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"to point out the house and made signs, ‘would he leave the paper there?’"
1914,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,He made signs ‘yes?’ and passed on.
1915,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1916,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Now at about half-past eight, our front doorbell rang and I heard a"
1917,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"call for me. I hurried down, and received the chore-woman’s message and"
1918,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,acted upon it at once.
1919,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1920,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Sometime afterwards, as I was in the back-chamber, I heard voices"

1922,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"a fence, and wondered how they happened to be coasting in such a place."
1923,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,Presently I heard a commotion on the other side and went to the front
1924,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"windows. All the sleds were drawn up near the steps, and the small boys"
1925,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,were stamping around like an army come to take the house. Seeing me they
1926,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"all shouted something at me. They seemed so terribly in earnest, and"
1927,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"came in such a strange way, that I flew down, sure something dreadful"
1928,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,had happened—perhaps Willy was drowned! and I began to tremble. At sight
1929,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"of me at the door they all shouted again, but I did not understand. I"
1930,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"caught hold of the biggest boy and pulled him inside, and said to him,"
1931,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"in a low, tremulous voice, ‘Tell me! What is it?’ He answered, in a"
1932,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"bashful way, ‘Mr. Pingry said he left the drafts open.’ ‘Thank you all!’"
1933,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,I said.
1934,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1935,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Next, the banana-man, bobbing his head, and making signs, though I"

1937,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"having written on it, but no name signed: ‘Your furnace drafts are"

1940,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“Grand company coming, I guess! exclaimed my sister, a short time"

1943,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,just about to take Mrs. Binney out for an airing. He mentioned it to her
1944,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,and she had him drive round with the message.
1945,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,
1946,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,"“By this time we were ready to go off, explode, shout, giggle, at the"

1950,_GRAN’MA GRACIE._,

1986,THE GROCER’S BOY.,THE GROCER’S BOY.
1987,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
1988,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
1989,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Sammy Swattles wasn’t a bad boy, you understand; he was simply"
1990,THE GROCER’S BOY.,thoughtless. He thoughtlessly did things which robbed him of peace of
1991,THE GROCER’S BOY.,mind for some time after he did them.
1992,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
1993,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"When Sammy was ten years old he had to leave school, to go to work for"
1994,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Mr. Greens, the grocer, in order to help support his mother."
1995,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
1996,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"He did a great many things for the grocer, from seven o’clock in the"
1997,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"morning till six at night, but his principal work was to place large"
1998,THE GROCER’S BOY.,paper bags on the scales and fill them with flour from the barrel.
1999,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2000,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"When the bag weighed twenty-three pounds, Sammy had to seal it up and"
2001,THE GROCER’S BOY.,take it to the family it was ordered for. The grocer allowed him two
2002,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"cents for every bag he carried, over and above his wages, which were"
2003,THE GROCER’S BOY.,$2.50 per week. Some weeks Sammy made over $3.00 which helped his mother
2004,THE GROCER’S BOY.,to run their little house quite comfortably.
2005,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2006,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Now, Sammy, in his thoughtlessness, used to sample quite a good deal of"
2007,THE GROCER’S BOY.,the grocer’s preserved ginger. Every time he would pass the tin boxes of
2008,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"ginger, he would thoughtlessly take a piece, and it would disappear in"
2009,THE GROCER’S BOY.,the recesses of Sammy’s rosy mouth.
2010,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2011,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"One night, after he had locked up all but the front door of the store,"
2012,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"he helped himself to quite a large piece of the ginger, and walked home."
2013,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2014,THE GROCER’S BOY.,He did not care for any supper that night. He felt as if bed was the
2015,THE GROCER’S BOY.,best place for his troubled little stomach.
2016,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2017,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"He hadn’t been in bed two minutes when a little fierce man, with a white"
2018,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"cloth round his black body and a huge grin on his ebony face, bounded"
2019,THE GROCER’S BOY.,into his room.
2020,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2021,THE GROCER’S BOY.,With a scream Sammy leaped out of bed and bounded out of the window.
2022,THE GROCER’S BOY.,With a yell the Indian was after him. Sammy flew down the road like a
2023,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"runaway colt, the black man in his rear yelling like thunder and lions."
2024,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Sammy never ran so fast in his life, but the little black man gained on"
2025,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"him, and finally caught him!"
2026,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2027,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Sammy pleaded hard to be spared to his mother, but the little man grimly"
2028,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"took him by the collar, and with one leap landed him on the island of"
2029,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Ceylon, in the Indian Ocean, at a place called Kandy. Then he led Sammy"
2030,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"out into the country, and blew a whistle. In an instant they were"
2031,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of men, women and boys, all as black"
2032,THE GROCER’S BOY.,as Sammy’s captor. Sammy cried:
2033,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2034,THE GROCER’S BOY.,“What have I done! what have I done!” and they all cried:
2035,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2036,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"“You have taken the ginger that we have gathered by hard work, without"
2037,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"permission, and you are condemned to live here for the rest of your life"
2038,THE GROCER’S BOY.,on ginger alone!”
2039,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2040,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Then Sammy began to cry real hard, for he thought of his poor mother,"
2041,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"off there in Massachusetts, wondering day after day, “What has become of"
2042,THE GROCER’S BOY.,my Sammy!”
2043,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2044,THE GROCER’S BOY.,And then to be compelled to eat nothing but ginger all his life! It was
2045,THE GROCER’S BOY.,awful! He already hated ginger. He looked so woebegone that they all
2046,THE GROCER’S BOY.,cried:
2047,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2048,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"“If you will promise to be good, and think before you do things, we will"
2049,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"let you go! But if you don’t keep your promise we’ll get you again, and"
2050,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"then, look out!”"
2051,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2052,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"So Sammy promised, and ran for home. But the black people seemed to"
2053,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"regret having let him off so easily, and they all came trooping after"
2054,THE GROCER’S BOY.,him!
2055,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2056,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"You should have seen Sammy run! He went over through India, and across"
2057,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Afghanistan, Persia and Turkey like a streak of lightning! He plunged"
2058,THE GROCER’S BOY.,into the Mediterranean and swam across to Italy. From Italy he swam to
2059,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Spain; and across Spain, from Tarragona to Cape Finisterre, he ran like"
2060,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"the Rapids of the River St. Lawrence, the black people at his heels!"
2061,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2062,THE GROCER’S BOY.,He was almost exhausted as he dove off Cape Finisterre into the broad
2063,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Atlantic, and he would have sunk down deep, for fifteen or twenty miles,"
2064,THE GROCER’S BOY.,if a friendly dolphin hadn’t come along and invited him to ride on its
2065,THE GROCER’S BOY.,shiny back!
2066,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2067,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"The black men gave up the chase then, and the dolphin swam over to"
2068,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"Massachusetts Bay, up Boston Harbor, to the Charles River, to the bridge"
2069,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"by Sammy’s home. There the dolphin said good-by, told Sammy to always be"
2070,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"a good boy, and then, with a flip of its tail, it rushed down the"
2071,THE GROCER’S BOY.,river—and Sammy awoke!
2072,THE GROCER’S BOY.,
2073,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"It had all been a dream, of course; but it cured Sammy of"
2074,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"thoughtlesness, and nobody ever had cause again to say that Sammy"
2075,THE GROCER’S BOY.,Swattles wasn’t all a nice little boy should be. He told his employer
2076,THE GROCER’S BOY.,"all about it, and his employer said: “Well, be a good boy, and never do"
2077,THE GROCER’S BOY.,anything without thinking of whether it’s right or wrong to do it.”
