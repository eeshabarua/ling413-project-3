37,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
38,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Charles Dwight was the son of a Christian missionary, and was born in"
39,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Constantinople, February 16th, 1837. When he was only four months old,"
40,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","he lost his mother by the plague. She was a good mother, and desired"
41,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",above all things for her children that they might become the disciples of
42,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",Christ.
43,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
44,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Charles, though a pleasant child, needed a new heart, as all children do,"
45,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","however lovely they may be. While yet young, he was made to feel this."
46,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",When he was about seven years old a child of a mission family died. This
47,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",led him to think of death. A sermon which he now heard made him pray
48,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",very much for his sins to be forgiven. The Holy Spirit was striving with
49,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","him. He soon yielded to His power, and put his trust in the Saviour. He"
50,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",now entered upon a new life. Prayer was his delight. The Bible was a
51,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",precious book. He aimed to do right and to make everybody happy.
52,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
53,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Charles’s companions could not help loving him, for he was always kind in"
54,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","his ways. Some of these, like himself, were pious youths. They never came"
55,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",together to spend any time in each other’s society without praying before
56,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",they parted. As one of these loved friends was about to leave on one
57,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","occasion, Charles said, “Let us not part till we have prayed together;”"
58,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","so they went into a room by themselves, and he read a chapter in the"
59,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Bible, and they knelt down and prayed."
60,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
61,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","That very night—it was Saturday, February 5th, 1853—he was seized with a"
62,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","headache. The most skilful aid was called in, but it could not help him."
63,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","His pains at times were very great, but he never lost his patience, nor"
64,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","his sweet hope in God. A part of the time his mind wandered, and then"
65,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","he kept talking, now in English, now in Greek, now in French, now in"
66,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Turkish,—but it was about Christ and his cause. Once, when a dear friend"
67,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",who was siting by him asked him if he felt ready for whatever might be
68,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","the result of his sickness, he said, “My head is in such pain that I"
69,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","cannot collect my thoughts; but sometimes I am able to do so, and then"
70,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",my mind is in perfect peace. But if I had not been led to make my peace
71,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","with God before this disease came upon me, I am sure I never could have"
72,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",done it now.”
73,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
74,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","At another time, in reply to a question from his father, he said with"
75,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","great feeling, “I cannot yet say that I _want_ to die now; but I desire"
76,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","the will of the Lord to be done. If He wills that I die now, _I am"
77,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",ready_.”
78,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
79,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","But why, do you suppose, did he not _want_ to die then? It was not"
80,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","because it is so happy to live. His life was indeed a happy one, but"
81,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",he knew it is far better to be with Christ. The reason why he seems to
82,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","have wished to live rather than to die, was, that he might do good. His"
83,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",heart was set on being a missionary. He hoped soon to visit his father’s
84,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","country for his education, and then to return, and preach the gospel. It"
85,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",was this that seemed to him even more desirable than to go at once and be
86,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",with Christ.
87,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
88,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Prayer was very sweet to him. Once, after his father had prayed with him,"
89,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","he said, “It is such a comfort to have you pray with me!” He also prayed"
90,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",himself. He asked of God that all the members of the church might “lead
91,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","holy lives,” and that those who are in their sins, and the children,"
92,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","might be converted. He ended as follows:—“O Lord, thou knowest how much"
93,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",greater than our words are our desires and necessities; and do thou hear
94,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","us and bless us as thou seest we need, for the sake of Jesus Christ, to"
95,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",whom be glory for ever. Amen.”
96,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
97,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",He also found great comfort in the Bible. As his father repeated passages
98,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","to him, such as “In my Father’s house are many mansions,” “This is a"
99,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came"
100,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","into the world to save sinners,” he would say, “Oh, how sweet! how"
101,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",precious!”
102,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
103,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","For twelve days he had been getting worse, and it was now plain that the"
104,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","conflict was nearly over. A little before the end, his father bent over"
105,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","him, and said, “Charles, can you now commit your soul into the hands of"
106,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Christ, as your gracious Saviour?” He replied, slowly, and with deep"
107,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","feeling, “I have done that _long ago_, papa.”"
108,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
109,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","His father, having heard these sweet words, threw himself on a sofa, and"
110,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","being very tired, quickly fell asleep. A loud call from a servant soon"
111,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","awoke him. He sprang to the bed, and found the poor sufferer in great"
112,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","pain, and in a few minutes his spirit was with Christ in heaven."
113,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
114,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",Would you join him there? Then “commit your soul into the hands of
115,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Christ, as your Saviour,” that you too may be able to say, at the end of"
116,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","life, “I have done that _long ago_.”"

123,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",And truly seeks his face;
124,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","That walks in all his holy ways,"
125,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",Depending on his grace.

127,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",God loves the child whose earliest youth
128,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",Is given to the Lord;
129,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Who fears his name, and speaks the truth,"
130,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",And trembles at his word.
131,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
132,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",God loves all those who prize his love;
133,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","And, till this life be past,"
134,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","Will shine upon them from above,"
135,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",And save them to the last.
136,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",
137,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","O heavenly Father! shine on me,"
138,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",And all my heart unite
139,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.","To love, and serve, and honour thee,"
140,"CHARLES DWIGHT; OR, THE MISSIONARY’S SON.",And make thee my delight.
