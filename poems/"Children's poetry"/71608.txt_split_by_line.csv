296,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
297,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
298,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,In such a country as ours—a country of “workies”—where there exists no
299,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"privileged class, falsely so called, unless idleness and ennui are"
300,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"privileges, one might suppose that a passion for gentility would be"
301,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,confined to the fashionable circles of the city; that the bees would as
302,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"soon be found giving preference to fashionable flowers, or aiming at a"
303,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fashionable style of architecture in their hives, as the busy matrons"
304,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"and maidens of New England, for instance, directing their thoughts,"
305,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"mainly, to genteel modes of living, dressing, and behaving."
306,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
307,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Doctor Johnson derives the word _genteel_, from the Latin word gentilis:"
308,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"meaning “of the same house, family name, ancestry, etc.” Its meaning"
309,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"has, probably, undergone as many modifications as the word _heretic_, of"
310,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,which the most accurate definition I have ever heard was given by a
311,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,young boy of twelve: “A heretic is a person that don’t believe as you
312,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"do.” It is plain he had not obtained this information from books, but"
313,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"from society. In like manner an ungenteel person is, with many, one who"
314,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"does not live, dress, and act, in all respects, as they do. The"
315,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"orthodoxy of one age or country, is the heresy of another; and the"
316,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"gentility of one, is the vulgarity of another."
317,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
318,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Thus it is with fashion, the handmaid of gentility; who has been well"
319,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,described as a jade that stalks through one country with the cast-off
320,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,clothes of another; and the modes and forms of gentility are as variable
321,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,as the wayward humors of those vacant-minded people who lead the
322,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,fashion.
323,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
324,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"How much more respectable, how much more _American_ it would be for us,"
325,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of this country, to limit the word, in our application of it, to"
326,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"something like its original meaning, and make gentility consist in"
327,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,living and acting conformably to the circumstances of one’s family or
328,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"station—not in a slavish, ignoble imitation of comparatively a few"
329,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"self-styled favored mortals, whose lot is cast in a different, but not a"
330,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,happier sphere.
331,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
332,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"There is one indispensable condition of absolute gentility, in the"
333,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"popular sense, which very few in our country can command, viz. an"
334,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,exemption from labor; and a hard condition it is—not for those who lose
335,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"caste on its account, but for those who, by fulfilling it, acquire"
336,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,caste. God made us to be active in mind and body—he gave a spring to
337,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,universal being—and standing water is the fit emblem of a stagnant life.
338,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"But even those to whom this exemption may seem desirable, cannot enjoy"
339,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"it, generally speaking, in our country."
340,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
341,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"A southern gentleman, describing a New England dinner, said, “In the"
342,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"first place, at the head of the table is always a roasted lady.” Now,"
343,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"although a southern dinner may not have so displeasing an accompaniment,"
344,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,we are assured by those who have been behind the scenes in families
345,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"abounding with slaves, that the mistress herself is the greatest slave"
346,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of all, since all the headwork, and some part of the _handy-work_ too,"
347,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"must be done by her; for instance, she must weigh out the food, and cut"
348,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,out the garments of her family servants.
349,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
350,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"But, notwithstanding this serious obstacle, nowhere, we are assured, is"
351,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"there such a strife for gentility, as in this country, where every other"
352,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"strife most incompatible with that, is perpetually carried on."
353,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
354,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"It is said to be peculiar to us, that our villages ape, so minutely,"
355,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the fashions of our cities; that no sooner is a new fashion of dress,"
356,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"or of the sleeve alone of a dress, introduced into the city, than"
357,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"straightway, as by magic, every sleeve in the country, from the"
358,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"shoulder of the squire’s wife to that of her youngest maid, is"
359,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fashioned precisely after the same model, or, if varied at all,"
360,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,exaggerated for the purpose of being _extremely_ fashionable. The
361,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"stoutest ploughboy in the land will not think of being married,"
362,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,without a silk stocking to his brawny foot. Nor do our female
363,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"domestics consider their wardrobe quite complete without, at least,"
364,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,one silk gown and one linen-cambric pocket-handkerchief.
365,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
366,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,And how soon is the infection caught by foreigners who come among us!
367,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"The sturdy German girl, although she may not immediately reject her"
368,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"national peasants’ costume of stout cotton stripe, and foot-gear adapted"
369,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to the out-of-door work she has been accustomed to, will be very likely"
370,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to surmount all with a “tasty” silk hat. All this may be very agreeable
371,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,as a proof of prosperity; but it must be remembered that prosperity
372,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"without discretion, is as unprofitable as zeal without knowledge."

380,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
381,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"We laugh at these demonstrations in our inferiors, without considering"
382,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,that we are guilty of absurdities quite as palpable to those in another
383,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,rank from ourselves. It is said that ladies of moderate fortune in
384,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"America, dress far more expensively than those of a corresponding rank"
385,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,in Europe; that we indulge in many expensive articles of dress which
386,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,they would not think of wearing.
387,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
388,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,I once knew a lady with whom the passion for gentility amounted almost
389,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to a disease. It seemed, in her, an innate propensity, or, at least, it"
390,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,was very difficult to account for it. Born in an obscure country
391,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"village, not entitled, either by her rank in life, character, education,"
392,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"or circumstances, to take precedence of her compeers, she nevertheless"
393,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"very early began to assume airs of great consequence, on account of"
394,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"superior notions in regard to gentility. Probably, feeling the desire"
395,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"which all have for consequence, and having nothing else to build it"
396,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"upon, she had recourse to extraordinary precision in various points of"
397,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"dress and bearing, in which she vainly imagined gentility chiefly to"
398,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,consist.
399,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
400,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Her father was a shop-keeper, or, as we are accustomed to say, a"
401,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"merchant, doing business on a small scale; both her parents were"
402,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"uneducated, ignorant and small-minded people, but simple and unassuming."
403,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Her ideas of gentility, therefore, had been principally derived from"
404,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"novels, and from intercourse with some of her companions who had enjoyed"
405,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a privilege she greatly coveted, but could not be allowed, of a six"
406,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,months’ residence at a city boarding-school.
407,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
408,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"As a young lady, the great objects of her ambition were a languid,"
409,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"delicate appearance, and a white hand. This strange perversion of the"
410,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"human mind is, I fear, not very unfrequent in young ladies, and is a"
411,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"legitimate consequence of subscription to a creed which virtually says,"
412,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“I believe that those only are entitled to the highest place in society,"
413,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,who have nothing to do.” Health is the vulgar privilege of the
414,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,working-man. But what a total absence of all _real_ claims to interest
415,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"and admiration is implied in a young lady’s relying for them, mainly,"
416,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"upon a sickly look! Who would exchange roses, pinks, and lilies, with"
417,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"all their beauty and fragrance, for the pale and scentless ghost-flower?"
418,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
419,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"My heroine, in order to effect this favorite object, had recourse to"
420,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"means which I should not like to specify, but which are only too"
421,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"familiar, I fear, to many of her sex—until her health became so"
422,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"seriously impaired that she was, all her life, a sufferer in"
423,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,consequence.
424,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
425,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Her mother, as mothers are apt to be, was exceedingly indulgent to her,"
426,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and although herself obliged to strain every nerve in order to bring up
427,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"comfortably and respectably a large family, upon very limited means,"
428,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,seldom obliged her to put her shoulder to the burden. If it did
429,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,sometimes happen that she was inevitably called upon to do other than
430,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"some of the “light work” of the family, a flood of tears washed out the"
431,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"disgraceful stain. She had, therefore, the privilege of preserving her"
432,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"hands white, while her mother’s wore the vulgar aspect and complexion of"
433,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,hard drudgery. And yet this abominable selfishness was not the “original
434,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,sin” of her nature; it was the result of her mind being diseased on the
435,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,subject of gentility.
436,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
437,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"But it was not until her marriage, when she became Mrs. William"
438,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Rutherford, and attained to the dignity of a housekeeper and matron,"
439,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,that her passion was fully developed. This was one of those marriages
440,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"brought about, as many are said to be, “by juxta-position.” William"
441,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Rutherford, the son of a farmer, a plain, sensible, energetic young man,"
442,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"who had, very honorably to himself, made his own way in the world,"
443,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,studied in a lawyer’s office overlooking a garden in which our heroine
444,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,often strayed.
445,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
446,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"The sight of a pretty girl walking among the flowers, was an agreeable"
447,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,variety to one whose vision rested many hours in the day upon the
448,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"grave-looking, monotonous pages of a law-book. He sometimes joined her,"
449,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"and she gave him flowers, for which, without any reference to its being"
450,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"genteel or ungenteel to like them, she had a genuine admiration; and a"
451,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,jar that stood upon his study table was daily supplied from her hand.
452,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"She was rather pretty, excessively neat in her appearance, and seemed"
453,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,always amiable.
454,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
455,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,The most energetic person in the world is not insensible to the
456,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"necessity, or at least the _agreeability_ of excitement, and by degrees"
457,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the plain, simple, natural, sensible William Rutherford was led on until"
458,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,he plighted heart and hand to this very _pretensionary_ and foolish
459,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"young woman. O the rashness of young men, and young women, too, in these"
460,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,momentous matters!
461,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
462,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Rutherford had too much of the instinct of a New England woman not
463,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to make a good housekeeper. She had profited by the lessons received
464,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"from her notable mother, albeit an unwilling and truant pupil. She was"
465,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"excessively nice in her habits, and would have her house in order even"
466,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,at the cruel sacrifice of vulgar personal exertions; but these were kept
467,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,secret as possible from neighbors and visitors.
468,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
469,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"An unfortunate visit which she made, the first year of her marriage, to"
470,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a cousin who had married a wealthy merchant in New York, greatly"
471,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,enlarged her ideas on the subject of gentility. She had previously set
472,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her heart upon a watch, as one of the ensignia, (now forsooth that very"
473,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,convenient article is very commonly laid aside because it is vulgar to
474,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"wear it!) but now she had in addition constantly before her eyes, in"
475,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"distant perspective, a Brussels carpet, hair sofa, mahogany chairs, and"
476,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"silver forks. These, though constituting a small part of her cousin’s"
477,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"splendor, were almost unknown articles in the village where she lived,"
478,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"and, therefore, would be sufficient to distinguish her."
479,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
480,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Although her husband was a thriving lawyer, and had his fair proportion"
481,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of the business done in the county, yet his income was moderate; and"
482,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"having amassed no property previous to his marriage, it was necessary"
483,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"that in all his arrangements, he should have reference to economy. Great"
484,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"pains were, therefore, necessary on the part of Mrs. Rutherford to"
485,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,secure these objects of her ambition. Never did a politician keep more
486,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"steadily in view what are supposed to be the politician’s aim, office"
487,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and power—never did the military hero keep his eye more steadfastly
488,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fixed upon the wreaths of victory with which he hoped to grace his brow,"
489,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"than did Mrs. Rutherford upon her hair sofa, Brussels carpet, mahogany"
490,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"chairs, and silver forks. For these she lived, and for these she would"
491,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"have done any thing—but die. There is, alas! no fashionable furniture"
492,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,for the grave; it has no privilege save that of rest to the weary. The
493,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,folly of “garnering up one’s heart” in the cunning but perishable works
494,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of man’s device, in outward show, is very striking when exhibited on so"
495,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,small a scale; magnificence covers up the folly to many eyes.
496,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
497,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Objects pursued with such steady determination are almost sure to be
498,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,gained in time. Mrs. Rutherford practised great economy with reference
499,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to their attainment, and although her husband had a far juster sense of"
500,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the right use of property, and had no taste for making more show than"
501,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"his neighbors—what will not a quiet, peace-loving man do, that he can"
502,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"do, to tranquilize the restless, unsatisfied spirit of his wife?"
503,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
504,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Poor Rutherford was a much enduring man. If during the sitting of the
505,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"court, (for he lived in the county town,) he invited some brother"
506,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"lawyers to dine with him, there being but an hour’s adjournment, and the"
507,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"dinner failed to appear seasonably, no earthly consideration would have"
508,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,induced his wife to leave the room and inquire into the reason of the
509,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,delay—and still less to do what she might toward preventing its further
510,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,continuance: because it would be ungenteel for the lady of the house not
511,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to be sitting in state with her guests—and horribly vulgar to be
512,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,supposed conversant with the mysteries of the kitchen.
513,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
514,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"When the dinner arrived at last, if her only servant, who officiated in"
515,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the double capacity of cook and waiter, were obliged to leave the room,"
516,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,not a plate must be passed until she returned to do the thing according
517,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to rule. No consideration of urgent haste—of comfort or convenience—was
518,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to be weighed for a moment with that of having her table _genteelly_
519,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,served.
520,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
521,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"But, notwithstanding her extreme anxiety to do the honors of her house,"
522,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"in what she supposed the most approved manner, she was utterly incapable"
523,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of performing the most important, dignified, and graceful part of the"
524,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"duty of a hostess,—that of contributing to the intellectual"
525,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"entertainment of her guests. In fact, she was deplorably ignorant. To"
526,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,give a single example: The conversation falling one day upon old English
527,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"poetry, a gentleman said to her, “I believe, Mrs. Rutherford, that Pope"
528,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"is not so great a favorite with the ladies as formerly.” “I don’t know,"
529,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"indeed, sir,” she replied; “was he a novelist? Scott is the favorite"
530,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"novelist now, I believe.”"
531,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
532,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,It was indispensable to her system to have always the air of being
533,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"waited upon. If the fire were down ever so low, she would prefer waiting"
534,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"any length of time, until her servant of all-work could answer the bell,"
535,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"rather than help herself to a stick of wood, although close at hand. A"
536,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"friend knocking for admission, might almost go away without getting it,"
537,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,if there were no one but the lady of the house to open the door. Even a
538,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"journey, recommended by her physician, for her only child, who had"
539,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"suffered much from teething, was not to be thought of, because the"
540,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,additional expense of a nurse could not be afforded: and it was _so_
541,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,vulgar to travel with a young child without a nurse! And yet she was not
542,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,an unfeeling mother—she would do anything for her child that was not
543,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"vulgar. Nights of weary watching, and days of laborious nursing, she"
544,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"submitted to with true maternal devotion. Even in his very wardrobe, her"
545,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"husband’s comfort was abridged, in conformity with her notions of what"
546,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"gentility required, inasmuch as at no season would he be allowed a"
547,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"cotton shirt, which in the winter he greatly preferred."
548,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
549,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,I said that by degrees Mrs. Rutherford attained all her objects. I beg
550,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,her pardon—the silver forks were still wanting to her complete
551,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,happiness. Against these her husband took his stand with the
552,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,determination of a desperate man. He said they were very proper for
553,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,those to use who were born with silver spoons in their mouths—very
554,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,proper for those who could afford them; but for a young man in his
555,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"circumstances, the introduction of such an article into his"
556,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,establishment would be perfectly preposterous—that silver forks would be
557,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a poor inheritance to his daughter, provided he left her nothing to eat"
558,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"with them. It was so very unusual for her husband to oppose her, that"
559,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Rutherford knew his opposition was not impulsive—not lightly
560,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,resolved upon; and she yielded to it submissively.
561,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
562,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,The child was of course included in the mother’s plans of gentility. She
563,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,was not suffered to attend school for fear she should contract vulgarity
564,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,from her schoolmates. Great pains were bestowed upon her dress; and as
565,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"what is deficient in money must be made up in time, there was a most"
566,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,lavish expenditure of what is still more valuable than money. Then she
567,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"was prevented, as far as possible, from doing any thing for herself."
568,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
569,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"This last point, however, was difficult of accomplishment. Little"
570,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Caroline herself was an extremely smart, active, capable child; and such"
571,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a one, who feels the energy stirring within her, cannot well be"
572,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"prevented, in such a very unartificial state of things as exists in a"
573,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"village family, from exerting it."
574,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
575,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,It is not often that a child derives benefit from her mother’s
576,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,absurdities; but Caroline Rutherford was an exception. The very
577,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,opposition she met with confirmed all her natural tendencies to
578,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"rationality; and, in consequence of her being excluded from the schools,"
579,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her father took great pains with her education, while her mother paid a"
580,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"degree of attention to her manners; which, though it could not render"
581,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her formal, (no training could have produced that result in her case,)"
582,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"had the effect to make her considerate and attentive. She grew up,"
583,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"therefore, a very pleasing, lovely girl."
584,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
585,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"When she was about the age of fourteen, a very exciting event occurred"
586,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"in their quiet village. A gentleman of fortune, who had determined to"
587,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"remove into the country, attracted by its healthy and picturesque"
588,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"location, selected it for his future residence, and purchased a place"
589,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,very near the dwelling of Mr. Rutherford.
590,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
591,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,This circumstance was rejoiced in by no one so much as by Mrs.
592,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Rutherford; and would have gone far toward compensating her for the want
593,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of silver forks, except that it made her feel the need of them so much"
594,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the more; because, “how could she invite Mr. and Mrs. Garrison to dine"
595,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,without them?”
596,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
597,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"She lost no time in calling upon her new neighbors, choosing for that"
598,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,purpose the latest hour compatible with the country dining hour. She had
599,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,previously arrayed herself in the manner she deemed most befitting the
600,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"occasion; that is, most calculated to recommend her to Mrs. Garrison as"
601,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a person of undoubted gentility, viz: with a dress of Gros de Berlin, a"
602,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"French cape, silk stockings, etc., etc."
603,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
604,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"To her surprise, she found Mrs. Garrison in a simple gingham morning"
605,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"dress, superintending the nailing down of a carpet; for her house was"
606,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"not yet in order. She received Mrs. Rutherford, however, in a very easy"
607,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"manner, conducting her to an adjoining apartment; and thus, after the"
608,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"usual preliminaries, was the turn given by the latter to the"
609,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,conversation.
610,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
611,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“I quite pity you, Mrs. Garrison, for having chosen a residence in the"
612,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,country.”
613,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
614,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Pity me, indeed! I thought all people who lived in the country were"
615,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,fond of it. Is it not so with you?”
616,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
617,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“O yes! I am very fond of flowers, and I think the country more healthy"
618,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,than town; but then we have such trouble with our servants. Such a thing
619,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,as a man-cook is quite out of the question. I often tell my husband that
620,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"there would be some sense, and some pleasure in having one’s friends to"
621,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"dine with you, if one could have a man-cook.”"
622,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
623,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“A man-cook, indeed!” replied Mrs. Garrison. “I did not know that such"
624,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,an appendage was ever thought of in the country. It is far from being
625,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"common in town; and for myself, I have never employed one. If I can get"
626,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,good women I shall be entirely satisfied.”
627,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
628,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Well, ma’am, you cannot be sure even of that; and then, if your"
629,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"servants happen to leave you, it is so difficult to supply their places."
630,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Really, Mrs. Garrison, to be left as we are exposed to be occasionally,"
631,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"almost without any help at all, is a calamity almost too great to be"
632,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"borne. Housework is so odious, so disagreeable, I almost loathe myself"
633,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,when I am obliged _to take hold of it_.”
634,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
635,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,This last expression led Mrs. Garrison to suspect that she had been
636,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,quite accustomed “to take hold” notwithstanding.
637,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
638,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“But your country ladies, in spite of these difficulties, have more"
639,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,leisure than we in town. You are not obliged to keep one servant to
640,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"answer the bell, and to spend the best part of the day yourself in"
641,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"receiving visits from a set of idlers, as formidable, to those who"
642,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"really value their time, as the unproductive consumer to the political"
643,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,economist.”
644,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
645,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Here Mrs. Rutherford found herself at fault. She looked quite puzzled
646,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"for a moment, and then replied—“_But you do not give refreshments to"
647,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"your morning visitors, Mrs. Garrison? That, I am told, is quite out of"
648,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,fashion._”
649,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
650,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“And then, too,” continued Mrs. Garrison, not appearing to notice this"
651,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"question, “we necessarily have a very large circle of acquaintance for"
652,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"many of whom we care very little; whereas, you in the country can limit"
653,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"yourselves as much as you please; and society is, with you, on"
654,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"altogether a more free, unceremonious, and friendly footing.”"
655,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
656,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“But then,” replied Mrs. Rutherford, “country people are, most of them,"
657,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,so vulgar. They know nothing of the forms of society.”
658,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
659,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“So much the better. In large circles of society they are necessary, but"
660,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"burdensome; and I expect to enjoy, very much, a more simple, unshackled"
661,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"state of existence. * * * * I had the pleasure of seeing your daughter,"
662,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"I believe, this morning; a charming looking girl.”"
663,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
664,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“My daughter! O Mrs. Garrison, I am very sorry indeed. She is a wild"
665,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"girl; and her father would indulge her to-day in a strawberrying frolic,"
666,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,so she was dressed accordingly. I am sure she was not fit to be seen.”
667,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
668,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“I cannot say how that may be, for my attention was so occupied by her"
669,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"bright eyes, rosy cheeks, and laughing smile, that I did not notice her"
670,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,dress at all. But the most proper dress is always that most befitting
671,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,the occasion; and she looks to me like a girl of too good sense not to
672,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,have regard to the fitness of things at all times.”
673,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
674,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Dress is another great trouble in the country, Mrs. Garrison. There is"
675,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"never a good dressmaker to be had. You may have your dress cut, to be"
676,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"sure, after a fashionable pattern; but then it will not have at all the"
677,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,air of a city-made dress.”
678,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
679,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“But I thought, Mrs. Rutherford, that exemption from much trouble of"
680,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"dress was another of your country privileges. In town, the tailor and"
681,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"dressmaker are the most important personages, to be sure; since it is"
682,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"not man as God made him, or as he has made himself, but as the tailor"
683,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"makes him, that is chiefly respected by a very large class—and so with"
684,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"woman; but in the country, people are valued for their intrinsic"
685,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"merits—their minds, and their hearts. This is their privilege and"
686,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,distinction.”
687,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
688,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“But I think, Mrs. Garrison, that no woman appears well who is not well"
689,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,dressed.”
690,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
691,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“If you mean, by being well dressed, dressed with neatness and"
692,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"propriety, I agree with you; but city finery, habitually worn, would"
693,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"seem to me as much out of place on the person of a country lady, as"
694,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,artificial flowers in her bosom.”
695,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
696,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Mrs. Rutherford took her leave, wondering to find Mrs. Garrison, a"
697,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"_lady_ in every sense of the word, so full of what she considered very"
698,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"odd notions; and did not fail, at dinner, to communicate to her husband"
699,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,the impression she had received.
700,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
701,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“I am thankful,” he replied, “that she is a woman of some sense. I beg"
702,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"your pardon, wife, but really your head is completely turned upon the"
703,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"subject of furniture, dress, etc.; and if Mrs. Garrison will set it"
704,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"right, she will do the greatest piece of service in the world that could"
705,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,be rendered to a poor fellow like me.”
706,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
707,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Why, Mr. Rutherford, I flattered myself you were quite proud of your"
708,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"wife. I am sure it is as much on your account as my own, that I wish to"
709,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,hold my proper place in society.”
710,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
711,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Your proper place! Yes, I wish to heaven that would content you; but"
712,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"you _do_ make capital pies, wife, I confess,” he said, as he tasted a"
713,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"delicious tart. Mrs. Rutherford was more gratified by his commendation,"
714,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,than she would have been had she understood its full import.
715,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
716,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Meanwhile Mrs. Garrison, in relating to her husband the events of the"
717,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"morning, said: “We talked, you know, of adapting ourselves to the"
718,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"tastes, manners, and habits of the country; but here is a village lady"
719,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"whose head is as full of fashions, modes, and rules of etiquette, as the"
720,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,finest town-lady’s of them all. How should it happen?”
721,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
722,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“An empty-headed woman I’ll be bound,” replied Mr. Garrison."
723,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
724,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Well, as to that I cannot tell. She certainly gave no great signs of"
725,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"intellectual cultivation, and that is the case with most of our fine"
726,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"ladies in town; but one would suppose that in the country, if a woman"
727,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"did not love books, she might busy herself in her domestic occupations,"
728,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"with bees, birds, flowers, etc., without being driven to dress and"
729,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,fashion as a refuge from the ennui of a vacant mind.”
730,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
731,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“What a strange race we are,” rejoined her husband, “to make it our"
732,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"boast that we are rational beings. I think, if those to whom man is said"
733,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to be only a little lower look down upon this busy scene, the pursuits"
734,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of the greater part of men, and women too, must seem just about as"
735,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,important as the children’s sport of blowing soap-bubbles seems to us.
736,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,One thing I have to congratulate myself upon—the principal lawyer in the
737,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"village, Mr. Rutherford, is a very clever, sensible, respectable man.”"
738,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
739,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“He must be this very lady’s husband.”
740,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
741,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Poor fellow! I am sorry for him then.”
742,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
743,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"When Caroline Rutherford returned from her strawberrying expedition,"
744,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"which had been very successful, she begged to be allowed to carry some"
745,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of her strawberries to Mrs. Garrison, who by her sweet voice and"
746,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,pleasing address had made a most agreeable impression upon her in their
747,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,short interview in the morning.
748,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
749,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Mrs. Rutherford was quite shocked at the suggestion. “Why, my dear"
750,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"child, your dress, shabby enough at best, is all in disorder. Your hair"
751,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"is out of curl, and you are red and heated. Besides, it is much more"
752,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"proper to send Sally with them. Get me a piece of note paper, and I will"
753,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,write a note.”
754,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
755,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“O, mother, do let me have my own way for this once.”"
756,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
757,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Her father nodded in a manner which expressed “go, my child,” and she"
758,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,was off in the twinkling of an eye.
759,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
760,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“O dear me! Mr. Rutherford, Caroline is so wild, so rustic, I am afraid"
761,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Garrison will be quite disgusted with her.”
762,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
763,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Never fear, my dear. I will pit my wild flower against the finest"
764,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,green-house plant of them all;” and well he might be proud of his wild
765,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,flower.
766,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
767,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"In spite of Caroline’s being “such a rustic,” Mrs. Garrison took a great"
768,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fancy to her from the beginning, and she soon became a favorite with the"
769,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"whole family. The oldest daughter, Fanny, was two years younger than"
770,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Caroline, and two of the sons were older. The mother was not long in"
771,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,discovering that Caroline would be a most useful associate to her
772,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,children in their lessons; and she invited her to join her little family
773,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"school. Her industry, energy, and quickness were a constant stimulus to"
774,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her fellow-pupils. Mrs. Garrison taught her music and drawing, which"
775,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,almost made Mrs. Rutherford forget the one calamity of her life—the
776,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,doing without silver forks.
777,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
778,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Notwithstanding her great delight when Mr. Rutherford ordered a piano
779,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"for his daughter, she could not refrain from hinting that she thought"
780,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"him rather inconsistent in incurring such an expense, after what had"
781,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,passed on the subject of the forks.
782,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
783,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“No, wife,” said he, “I do not admit this at all. The forks, in our"
784,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"case, would be for mere show; but the piano will be a source of constant"
785,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"daily enjoyment. The pleasure of a song from Caroline, accompanied by"
786,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her instrument, is to me worth all the pomp and magnificence of a"
787,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"palace; ’tis ‘a sacred and home-felt delight.’ Then, think how she"
788,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"enjoys it! Besides, all these things add to the resources from which she"
789,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"would not fail to derive her support, if left penniless to-morrow.”"
790,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
791,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,That Mr. Rutherford might feel no scruples of delicacy in regard to
792,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"receiving all these favors for his daughter, Mrs. Garrison employed her"
793,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to assist in teaching the younger children.
794,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
795,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Caroline often excited her mother’s astonishment by her reports of what
796,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"was going on, from time to time, at Mrs. Garrison’s. One day they had"
797,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"all employed the recess in assisting Mrs. Garrison, in country phrase,"
798,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“to clean up her yard;” which, in this instance, amounted only to"
799,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"gathering from the lawn the dry leaves, bits of sticks, etc., which had"
800,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,been carelessly left behind by the person who had been sent to perform
801,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,that duty. At another time Caroline had had the sole charge of the
802,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"school in the morning, because Mrs. Garrison, reduced to extremities by"
803,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"some disarrangement of her domestic establishment, had been engaged in"
804,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,washing windows! and performing divers other services of a similar
805,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"nature; but “I can tell you, mother,” she added, “that she looks just as"
806,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"much like a lady when she is washing windows, as when she is sitting at"
807,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her drawing-board.” Occasionally, when the waiter had been ill or"
808,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"absent, one of the children had tended table in her stead; and once,"
809,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"when one of the servants was laid up with a rheumatic limb, her mistress"
810,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"would bathe it herself, several times in the day, in order to be sure"
811,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"that it was properly done. But the greatest wonder of all was, that a"
812,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"young sister of Mrs. Garrison’s came to visit her, bringing an infant"
813,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"without a nurse to take care of it; and not only that, but dragged it"
814,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"about the streets of the village in a little wicker wagon, while mother"
815,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and child were both so pretty as to attract every body’s attention.
816,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
817,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"At the expiration of two years after their first arrival in the village,"
818,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mr. and Mrs. Garrison determined to obtain the assistance of a private
819,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,tutor in the education of their children. They were fortunate in finding
820,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a young man, a Mr. Cleaveland, of accomplished education and pleasing"
821,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"manners, who knew how to make his pupils like not only their books but"
822,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,their teacher too. He was in the condition of many young men in our
823,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"country, whose education constitutes their only fortune. He was destined"
824,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"for the pulpit, and had yet to acquire his profession in part."
825,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
826,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Fanny Garrison, accustomed hitherto only to her mother’s teaching, could"
827,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"not be reconciled to the idea of being taught by a strange gentleman,"
828,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,unless Caroline would become a fellow-pupil. Nearly two years passed
829,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"away, during which Caroline made rapid progress in various branches of"
830,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,education—outstripping even the older boys in some of those studies
831,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"which, until recently, have been almost universally regarded as"
832,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,inappropriate to women.
833,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
834,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Rutherford had already begun to speculate upon Caroline’s chances
835,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"in the matrimonial lottery. She had no doubt that such a girl, with a"
836,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fine countenance, engaging manners, highly educated, and full of"
837,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"vivacity, would, in time, make “a _genteel_ match.” Now and then a vague"
838,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fear that young Cleaveland might aspire to the hand of her daughter,"
839,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"crossed her mind; but did not impress itself, because it was “impossible"
840,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"that a girl so genteelly bred and educated, should think of marrying a"
841,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"poor young minister, and almost equally so, that a poor young minister"
842,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,should think of aspiring to her.”
843,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
844,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"She settled it in her own mind, that if Caroline should have altogether"
845,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a suitable offer in the course of a few years, it was not to be"
846,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"rejected; but otherwise, there could not be a doubt that Frank"
847,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Garrison’s present youthful fondness for her might be cultivated into a
848,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,permanent sentiment. The country maid and her milk-pail will remain
849,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,through all time the faithful and most fitting personification of a
850,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,castle-builder.
851,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
852,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Rutherford could not forbear communicating to her husband some of
853,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her thoughts upon the subject which occupied her so much, and declaring,"
854,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"in unequivocal terms, her unwillingness to Caroline’s making only a"
855,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“common match,” on the ground of her being a fit wife for a man of"
856,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fortune, and qualified to grace a genteel establishment."
857,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
858,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Now, I will tell you what, wife,” replied her husband, “you do not know"
859,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,what is best for yourself or her either. Caroline is just the girl for a
860,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"good, honest fellow, who has got to make his own way in the world; such"
861,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a man wants just such a helper, or help-meet, as the Bible has it. It"
862,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"would be a pity to have her good sense, and fine spirits, and energy,"
863,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"and education thrown away where they ain’t wanted, or rather where they"
864,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,won’t be all called into requisition and turned to the greatest possible
865,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"account. He who gets his living by hard work, whether of the head or the"
866,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"hands, wants a wife who will order well his house and educate his"
867,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,children—who will strengthen him in weakness—encourage him in
868,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,despondency—confirm him when irresolute—soothe him when
869,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"irritated—comfort and bless him perpetually with her sympathy, and look"
870,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"bright, beautiful, and refreshing to him when the day’s toil is over."
871,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Now a rich man’s wife need not _do_ any thing; his wealth can command
872,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the aid of hands enough and heads enough, without hers. Then his"
873,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,pleasures are very apt to be in a great many other things besides his
874,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"wife; and a woman who knows how to dress smart, and receive his company"
875,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"genteelly, as you say, will do very well for him. But to a poor man his"
876,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,wife and children are his all-in-all of pleasure; and to make the
877,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"happiness of a man who has every thing good in himself, but to whom the"
878,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"gifts of fortune have been denied, ought to be sufficient to satisfy any"
879,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,woman.”
880,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
881,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Of course Mrs. Rutherford rejected such heretical doctrines altogether,"
882,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,though she had no hope of converting him who professed them.
883,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
884,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Meanwhile the simple, happy Caroline mused not of love; she was too"
885,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"happy—too much occupied—too well satisfied with the present, to think of"
886,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the future. Life, with her, was perpetual sunshine. She was very fond of"
887,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,her father—had a kind and dutiful feeling toward her mother—loved the
888,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Garrisons dearly—was exceedingly interested in her studies—and liked Mr.
889,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Cleaveland very much. She liked him because she found his assistance
890,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,very valuable to her in her studies—because he was not only exceedingly
891,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"devoted, in his office as teacher, to all his pupils, but made them very"
892,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"happy—because he manifested, in all situations, great delicacy of"
893,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"feeling and the kindest consideration for others, showing that he felt"
894,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,deeply and tenderly the bonds of human brotherhood—because he had an
895,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"agreeable talent at conversation—because he loved the water-falls,"
896,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fields, rivers, and groves as well as she did, and, when school was"
897,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"over, liked nothing better than to ramble and sport in true country"
898,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fashion—and lastly, she liked him, as I suppose, because he liked her;"
899,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"for a reason akin to this, enters, more or less, I believe, into the"
900,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,rationale of all the partialities of man for his brother man.
901,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
902,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Garrison felt some responsibility in regard to bringing so lovely a
903,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,girl as Caroline Rutherford into constant association with a
904,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,marriageable young man of no small attractions. But she knew him
905,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"thoroughly—was certain that he was worthy of confidence, and, besides,"
906,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"was herself constantly with the whole group, both in school and in the"
907,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,hours of recreation.
908,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
909,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,How could Charles Cleaveland but fall in love? Not at first sight—not
910,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,because it had seemed to him a very probable thing that he should; but
911,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,because there was no earthly reason why he should not—because there was
912,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"every thing to please his fancy, gratify his affections, and approve"
913,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"itself to his reason, in the young creature with whom he was daily"
914,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,associated in interesting pursuits and delightful recreations. In school
915,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"she was that paragon of perfection to a teacher, a diligent, docile, and"
916,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"apt pupil; by the stream, a naiad; in the groves, a wood-nymph; in the"
917,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"garden and the meadow, the ideal of a bird or a butterfly. How could she"
918,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"but come, in time, to haunt his imagination and make her home in his"
919,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"heart, in one and all the bewitching forms of love’s metempsychosis?"
920,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
921,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"His interest had been for some time deeply excited, before she became"
922,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,aware of the state of his mind or her own. But the truth gradually
923,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"dawned upon her when, time after time as she raised her head, she found"
924,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"him intently gazing upon her; when she perceived unwonted abstraction,"
925,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"on his part, in the hours of her recitations; when she found herself, by"
926,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"some strange magic or other, meeting him at every turn, as if he knew"
927,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,all her out-goings and in-comings; when his visits at her father’s
928,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"hitherto, on account of her mother’s forbidding manners few and far"
929,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"between, became more and more frequent; and as she sat at the piano,"
930,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"where he always liked to place her, she could _feel_ the intensity of"
931,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,his gaze until it produced a burning in her own cheek.
932,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
933,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Then she, too, began to muse of him. He was the subject of her"
934,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,day-dreams and night-dreams; his image forever in her mind; sleep did
935,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"not displace it. It was there when she closed her eyes to sleep, and"
936,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,there to greet her at the first moment of her waking. The animated
937,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Caroline became pensive; the social Caroline began to affect solitary
938,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"walks and lonely sittings in her chamber. She gazed upon the moon, or"
939,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,she listened to the murmuring brook or the whispering grove; and the gay
940,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and joyous feeling with which she had been accustomed to mingle herself
941,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"with the harmonies of nature, gave way to one of sacred tenderness, as"
942,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,they seemed to her spirit to give forth a deeper tone.
943,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
944,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Still her natural equanimity came in aid of her maidenly reserve to
945,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"conceal from her lover the true state of her heart, and he felt by no"
946,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,means certain that his love was requited. But neither was he hopeless;
947,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and knowing that it would be difficult for him to carry himself toward
948,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,her as he ought during the three months that still remained of his
949,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,engagement with Mrs. Garrison without having an explanation with
950,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Caroline, which it would be improper for him to seek while he stood in"
951,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"his present relation to her, he determined to ask it as a favor of Mrs."
952,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Garrison that she would release him, which he did, of course, without"
953,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,assigning his principal motive.
954,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
955,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"The morning after this arrangement was made, Mrs. Garrison entered the"
956,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"school-room just as Caroline was finishing a recitation, and said, “Now,"
957,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"children, do your best to leave an agreeable impression upon the mind of"
958,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Mr. Cleaveland, who is going to resign the charge of you in two weeks.”"
959,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
960,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Poor Caroline turned deadly pale, and the paleness was instantly"
961,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,succeeded by a deep blush. She took up her book and returned instantly
962,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to her seat, hoping she had been unobserved; but she was mistaken. Such"
963,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a revelation is rarely lost upon a lover; and, in this instance, did not"
964,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,escape the observation of Mrs. Garrison.
965,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
966,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"At any other time, Mr. Cleaveland would have been gratified by the"
967,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,lively and most unaffected demonstrations of regret with which the
968,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,announcement of his speedy departure had been received by the whole
969,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"group of children. But now, one deep joy swallowed up all the rest; and"
970,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,his utter inability to reply to them would have been extremely
971,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"embarrassing, had not Mrs. Garrison kindly and considerately relieved"
972,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,him by a request that he would look into a new school-book which she had
973,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,just received.
974,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
975,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"His only trouble in life now, was the interminable duration of two"
976,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"weeks. That period of time overpast, he would declare his love, and then"
977,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"devote himself to his profession with the intent to hasten, as much as"
978,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"possible, the time when he might claim his bride. Meanwhile, Caroline"
979,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"had no resource but to put on, as far as possible, the appearance of"
980,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,being more than ever absorbed in her studies.
981,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
982,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Rutherford had not been unobservant of the signs of the times in
983,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"regard either to Caroline or Cleaveland, and felt extremely uneasy and"
984,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"anxious. Her husband, on the contrary, she knew would like nothing"
985,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,better than just such a match for his daughter; and therefore she
986,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"determined, in the present emergency, to keep her own counsels and act"
987,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,for herself.
988,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
989,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"During this last memorable fortnight, Cleaveland almost entirely"
990,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"suspended his visits to the Rutherfords, and his intercourse with"
991,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Caroline, except as her teacher; because he found it almost impossible"
992,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to carry himself toward her as circumstances required.
993,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
994,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"On the last day Caroline, although she had got up with a violent"
995,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"headache, would not remain at home for fear of exciting suspicion or"
996,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"remark; but her illness was so apparent, that Mrs. Garrison had insisted"
997,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,upon her leaving the school.
998,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
999,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Cleaveland had not _seemed_ nearly as much occupied with herself, as"
1000,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"usual, ever since his departure had been determined upon. She was in no"
1001,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"state to solve the problem of this change by an argumentative process,"
1002,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and she began to think she had deceived herself—that she had been merely
1003,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,an agreeable and exciting circumstance in the present scene of his
1004,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,residence—no longer valued when he was so soon to exchange it for
1005,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"another. When she went home, therefore, she threw herself upon her bed,"
1006,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and burst into a flood of tears.
1007,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1008,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Meanwhile her lover with difficulty possessed his soul, until the hour"
1009,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of emancipation came, and he felt at liberty to throw himself at her"
1010,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"feet. He then went in pursuit of her, in the sweet hope that by a few"
1011,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,magic words—the lover’s sesame—he should unlock her carefully guarded
1012,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"heart, and find its wealth all his own. No one was at home but Mrs."
1013,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Rutherford.
1014,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1015,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Where is Miss Caroline?”
1016,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1017,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“She has gone to walk—”
1018,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1019,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Gone?—which way?”
1020,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1021,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"There was something in his manner which revealed, or, at least, led Mrs."
1022,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Rutherford to suspect the nature of his errand. She believed that the
1023,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"crisis had come, and that now, if ever, was the moment for interference."
1024,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1025,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"To his questions she only replied, evidently somewhat embarrassed, “Mr."
1026,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Cleaveland, I want to speak a word with you.”"
1027,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1028,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"He was already on his way out, and turned most reluctantly."
1029,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1030,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Walk into the parlor a moment, Mr. Cleaveland. I don’t know how Mr."
1031,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Rutherford feels about this business, but I think that, as a mother, I"
1032,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,have a better right than any one else to decide about it.”
1033,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1034,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Cleaveland, at first, would not guess to what she referred; and,"
1035,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"perceiving that he did not understand her, she continued: “I know it is"
1036,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,a very delicate matter for me to take it for granted that you would like
1037,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to marry Caroline. If I am mistaken, there is no harm done, and you will"
1038,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"excuse me; if I am not mistaken, it would be too late, after you young"
1039,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"people had settled the matter between you, for me to express my decided"
1040,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"disapprobation of it, and therefore I do it now. I appeal to you, Mr."
1041,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Cleaveland, as a mother, whose soul is bound up in her child, to give up"
1042,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,all thoughts of a connection which would fall very far short of my hopes
1043,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,and wishes for my daughter.”
1044,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1045,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"For a moment, poor Cleaveland sat like one stupified. Then, without any"
1046,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"parting salutation to Mrs. Rutherford, without even a single word in"
1047,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"reply to her strange harangue, he hastily left the house. He retreated"
1048,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to his own room; but experienced there a stifling sensation, which he"
1049,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,thought to relieve by going into the open air; and pursuing his way to a
1050,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"favorite haunt, he met Caroline just emerging from the little grove he"
1051,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,was about to enter.
1052,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1053,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Not daring to trust himself with her a moment, and unable to command his"
1054,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"voice, he hastily passed her with hardly the seeming of a recognition."
1055,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Her headache had left her much exhausted, and a dizzy faintness now came"
1056,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"over her, so that it was with great difficulty that she reached her"
1057,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"home, although not very far distant."
1058,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1059,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Meanwhile her lover was in a most piteous state of agitation and
1060,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,perplexity. Was he obliged in honor to heed the matrimonial veto?
1061,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Believing that Caroline was attached to him, was it right to keep her in"
1062,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"ignorance of his love? Her father, too, had given him the most undoubted"
1063,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,proofs of his esteem; and so far from showing any jealousy or suspicion
1064,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"of him, had always acquiesced entirely in all those arrangements which"
1065,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"had brought them together so much, might he not refer the matter to him?"
1066,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,But to appeal to the husband against his wife—to the daughter against
1067,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her mother—this would be neither manly nor delicate, perhaps not"
1068,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"honorable; he was not quite sure. To fly, then, was his only refuge."
1069,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1070,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"He wrote a note to Mrs. Garrison, complaining of illness, saying that he"
1071,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"had been induced, by unexpected circumstances, to leave town, contrary"
1072,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"to his first intentions, on the following day; but that, on the whole,"
1073,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"he preferred not taking leave of them personally, as the parting would,"
1074,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"on his part, be a very painful one. He thanked her, in glowing terms,"
1075,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"for all her kindness, adding, that he never expected to be so happy"
1076,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,again as under her roof.
1077,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1078,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Garrison was surprised by this last expression; surprised by his
1079,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"hasty departure, and by his omitting to make his adieus in person; and"
1080,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"had a vague idea of some mystery in the matter, which she hoped time"
1081,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,might solve. He went off at two o’clock in the morning.
1082,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1083,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Rutherford took especial care to conceal the fact of his having
1084,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"called to see her, from Caroline, who forbore to make any inquiries; and"
1085,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Mr. Rutherford being out of town, no investigation was made upon the"
1086,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,subject.
1087,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1088,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Poor Caroline! her brightness was, for the present, all obscured. Her"
1089,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"headache returned violently, and she was really ill for some days; but"
1090,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"even after she had no longer an excuse for playing the invalid, her"
1091,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"spirits did not return; she had sleepless nights and languid days, and"
1092,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,her very soul seemed to have died away within her.
1093,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1094,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Her father was excessively distressed. At first he tried to rouse her
1095,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"spirits by a little raillery. “You remind me,” said he, “of a fine"
1096,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,peach-tree which I came near losing last spring. It was in full life and
1097,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"beauty, just as you were, but suddenly a blight came over it which"
1098,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,threatened its destruction. I dug around the root and found one little
1099,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"worm there—that removed, the tree flourished again.”"
1100,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1101,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Poor Caroline made no reply, but burst into tears and retreated to her"
1102,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,room.
1103,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1104,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“There _is_ a canker-worm at the root, you may depend upon it, wife; and"
1105,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,it appears to me that you might detect it.”
1106,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1107,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mrs. Rutherford looked as if she were a little disturbed at the idea of
1108,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,any investigation.
1109,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1110,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“If you do know, wife,” said he, “and don’t choose to reveal what you"
1111,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"know, the responsibility rests with you, and her blood be upon your"
1112,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"head. Tell me, now, what is your idea upon the subject, has not Caroline"
1113,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,been unhappy ever since young Cleaveland went away?”
1114,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1115,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Yes.”
1116,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1117,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Did you ever think that they were in love?”
1118,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1119,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“I thought _he_ was.”
1120,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1121,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“And yet he went off without broaching the matter at all. If it is all
1122,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"on her part, the thing must be submitted to; and yet it seems to me he"
1123,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,could hardly help falling in love with her.”
1124,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1125,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“No, indeed!” said Mrs. Rutherford, gathering courage to do now what she"
1126,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"had half resolved to do before, “he did fall in love with her.”"
1127,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1128,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Then why did he not tell her so?”
1129,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1130,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Because I forbade him.”
1131,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1132,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Did he apply to you on the subject?”
1133,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1134,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“No. I applied to him.”
1135,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1136,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“Then how could you be certain that he had any design of offering
1137,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,himself to her?”
1138,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1139,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,“You would not have had any doubt of it had you seen him as I did; and
1140,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"besides, he would have denied it if it had not been so.”"
1141,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1142,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“O wife! what _was_ your inducement? He is not _genteel_ enough for you,"
1143,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"I suppose. Confound your genteel notions,” he continued, as, losing"
1144,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"control of himself, he became exceedingly exasperated; “I would give all"
1145,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the gentility you ever had, or ever can have, for a few grains of sense"
1146,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"or common maternal feeling. I knew you would give up health, and"
1147,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"comfort, and good neighborhood, and your own soul, if necessary, for"
1148,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,gentility; but I thought your child was dearer to you than your own
1149,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,soul.”
1150,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1151,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“Why, Mr. Rutherford, I do really think you are very unkind,” said the"
1152,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"lady, bursting into tears."
1153,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1154,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"“How the devil,” he continued, without heeding her emotion, “did you"
1155,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"ever come to marry such an ungenteel fellow as I am, and thus establish"
1156,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"a precedent for your daughter to follow? Go and comfort her, and say to"
1157,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"her, ‘My dear, console yourself that I have saved you from the disgrace"
1158,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,consequent upon such a connection as I had the misfortune to form.’ Tell
1159,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,her never to mind losing the chance of being made happy by a capital
1160,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fellow whom she loves, and who loves her, because by-and-by, if she live"
1161,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"long enough, she may possibly marry a money-purse, ride in a carriage,"
1162,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"tread on Brussels carpets, and have a plenty of mirrors and glasses to"
1163,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"see herself in, and couches to recline upon, and silver forks to eat"
1164,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,with—who knows? Tell her it is all a mistake to suppose that happiness
1165,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,has anything to do with the mind or the heart; that it is all a thing of
1166,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"the eyes. Tell her its foundations are laid up in brick and mortar, and"
1167,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,its superstructure is comprised of all the costly materials that can be
1168,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"gathered together from the four corners of the earth. Go now, quick,"
1169,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"wife, call her down stairs, and bid her look at your best parlor—your"
1170,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,better half—and tell her you expect she will have a whole suit of such
1171,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"apartments, only a great deal finer. Say to her, ‘Look at it, Caroline;"
1172,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"gaze on it, my child, and forget the image of him who, though God’s"
1173,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"noblest work, cannot afford to manufacture happiness for you out of"
1174,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"cabinet-ware and upholsterers’ stuffs.’ Go, wife, and be eloquent.”"
1175,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1176,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Having thus _exploded_, he left the house."
1177,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1178,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Poor Mrs. Rutherford had never heard her husband indulge in such a vein
1179,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"before. She was kind and attentive to his comfort, and his disposition"
1180,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"led him to make the most, both to her and to himself, of whatever in her"
1181,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"was good and commendable. She did not suspect, therefore, that there"
1182,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,ever lurked in his bosom a feeling of contempt. It was a wretched day
1183,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,for the whole family.
1184,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1185,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"In the evening, after Caroline bade good-night, the subject was renewed."
1186,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Mr. Rutherford had thought much and deeply upon it. Had Cleaveland
1187,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"avowed his love, he might go to him at once, and tell him that his wife"
1188,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"repented the step she had taken—but now, what was to be done? he could"
1189,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,not tell.
1190,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1191,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Matters went on thus for about three months, during which Mrs. Garrison"
1192,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,shared in the solicitude which Caroline’s parents felt on her
1193,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"account—although, in seeing her droop, she could only guess at the"
1194,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"cause. She corresponded with Mr. Cleaveland, but he never mentioned"
1195,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Caroline—and she could only venture upon what might seem an accidental
1196,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"reference to her, and allusion to her poor health and spirits. At the"
1197,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,end of three months she received from him the following letter:—
1198,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1199,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"MY DEAR MRS. GARRISON—Your very great kindness, and your most generous"
1200,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"sympathy so constantly manifested towards me, induces me to lay before"
1201,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"you a matter that very nearly concerns me, for the purpose of"
1202,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,obtaining your advice in circumstances of great delicacy and
1203,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,perplexity.
1204,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1205,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"I think it could not have altogether escaped your observation, that,"
1206,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,as would probably have befallen most other young men in like
1207,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"circumstances, I lost my heart to your fair young friend, my pupil."
1208,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Nor was I a despairing lover—may my presumption be pardoned, in"
1209,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,believing that I occasionally discovered through the veil of her most
1210,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"delicate and maidenly reserve, a certain tremulousness of feeling"
1211,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,which that veil could not entirely disguise—an occasional agitation of
1212,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"manner on her part, from which I derived the flattering conclusion"
1213,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,that it was sometimes given to me to touch “the electric chain with
1214,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,which she’s darkly bound.”
1215,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1216,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,But I waited until one relation with her should be at an end before
1217,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,attempting to establish another; and just as I was on the point of
1218,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"declaring myself, her mother, suspecting my intention, interfered to"
1219,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"prevent its fulfilment—saying, as nearly as I can remember, that such"
1220,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,an union would fall far below her wishes and hopes for her daughter.
1221,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1222,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,I do indeed feel that I am not worthy of such a treasure as Caroline
1223,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,Rutherford. But I suppose it would be doing Mrs. Rutherford no
1224,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"injustice to believe that my most striking deficiency in her eyes,"
1225,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"would be made up at once, were I to come into possession of a fortune."
1226,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1227,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,I am very wretched—and it is possible that I am not alone in my
1228,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,wretchedness. It does not seem fitting that the destiny of two human
1229,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"beings capable of acting and choosing for themselves, should be"
1230,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,controlled by idiosyncrasies of a third person. It does not seem
1231,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"fitting that if we are capable of loving and making each other happy,"
1232,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,we should be separated by such a paltry wall of partition. I have a
1233,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"strong impression, too, that Mr. Rutherford would favor my suit. And"
1234,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"yet, what can I do? How am I to break the fetters that Mrs. R. has"
1235,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"thrown around me? Give me your counsel, I pray you, and add one more"
1236,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,to the many obligations which you have already heaped upon.
1237,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,
1238,BY MRS. CHARLES SEDGWICK.,"Your very grateful and affectionate friend,"
1239,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.
1240,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,
1241,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,Mrs. Garrison was not long in deciding what to do. Her great kindness to
1242,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"Caroline, and the services which she had rendered her, entitled her to"
1243,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,act in whatever concerned her welfare. Having provided herself with a
1244,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"store of arguments to overcome all objections, and set the matter in its"
1245,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"true light, she determined to appeal directly to Mrs. Rutherford"
1246,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"herself. To her surprise and joy, she found her most thankful to avail"
1247,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,herself of the opportunity to retract her injunction. Her home once so
1248,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"pleasant, had become so cheerless, and her husband so estranged—to say"
1249,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"nothing of Caroline—that in the exigencies of the present, she forgot"
1250,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,all her visions for the future.
1251,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,
1252,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,Of course Mrs. Garrison lost no time in communicating the result to her
1253,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,friend; and Mrs. Rutherford was no less eager to inform her husband of
1254,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,what had happened.
1255,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,
1256,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"“Well, now,” said he, “Caroline shall know of this at once. She must"
1257,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,have it explained to her sooner or later—why Cleaveland went off in so
1258,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,strange a manner; better hear it from me than from her lover; it will be
1259,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"awkward for him to tell it; and, besides, she has suffered enough"
1260,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"already; and now, when better things are in store for her, the sooner"
1261,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,she enters into the enjoyment of them the better.” * * * * Before
1262,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"Caroline slept that night, there was, for her, balm, and a physician—and"
1263,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,her sorrows were all healed.
1264,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,
1265,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"The next week the lovers met without explanation,—save the tears of"
1266,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"Caroline, and the trembling lips and hand of Charles. They met, as if"
1267,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"they had parted acknowledged lovers, and been, since that time, cut off"
1268,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,from each other by some sore calamity. From their dark hour broke forth
1269,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,a rosy dawn which in time was kindled to perfect day. The bloom soon
1270,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"gathered again on Caroline’s cheek, and her eye was once more soul-lit."
1271,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,
1272,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,Charles was not long in obtaining a respectable settlement. Caroline was
1273,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,henceforth permitted to manage her own affairs; to make her outfit such
1274,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"as became a country clergyman’s wife, with every provision for comfort"
1275,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,"and none for display; and to have a perfectly unostentatious wedding,"
1276,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,without a supper—without even champagne.
1277,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,
1278,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,She lived to realize her father’s beau-ideal of a woman’s happiness—to
1279,CHARLES CLEAVELAND.,be the “all-in-all of pleasure” to a man in every way worthy of her.

1739,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.
1740,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1741,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1742,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,There was one event of my boyish days which is the cause of such amusing
1743,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"reminiscence in my later years, that I cannot refrain, dear reader, from"
1744,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"making you acquainted with it. It happened upon a time, after I had worn"
1745,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"out my first frock coat, and got tired of trundling hoops and wagons,"
1746,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and drawing sleds, that I felt, as many boys do, an inordinate desire to"
1747,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,experience the comforts of _whittling_; but I had no knife—always
1748,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"excepting an old _case-knife_ which mother used to lend me. But then,"
1749,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"this was not _the thing_; for, besides being inconvenient, I could not"
1750,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_shut it up_, and put it in my pocket, and walk about with the proud"
1751,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"consciousness that it was _my own_—not _borrowed_ from any one, but"
1752,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"MINE—sacred to _my_ individual use and behoof. However, believing that"
1753,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"my youthful happiness depended upon the gratification of this desire, I"
1754,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,treated with mother to negotiate with father upon the subject of
1755,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,procuring me a knife. This was on a Saturday afternoon in the month of
1756,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"July. Mother told me that, if I would be a good boy, and _keep_ that"
1757,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"night and the next day (Sunday) as I ought, and go to school every day,"
1758,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and study hard, and mind the schoolmistress, and divers other"
1759,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,conditions—to all of which I eagerly consented without considering the
1760,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"possibility of fulfilling them—on these conditions, I say, she, on her"
1761,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"part, promised to ask father to give me a _knife_. Accordingly, in"
1762,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"pursuance of our stipulations, I kept Saturday night very well—went to"
1763,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"bed early—went to sleep, and straightway to dreaming of the glorious"
1764,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,fruition of all my hopes. I dreamed that I had a new knife—that I
1765,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,“_sharpened it up_” until it would _cut a hair_—that I had a soft piece
1766,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"of seasoned white pine—that, in fact, I was _whittling_! And how"
1767,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,inexpressible was the delight which I experienced! Surely moral
1768,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,philosophers should give mankind—at least the _boy_ part of it—credit
1769,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"for a new and additional sense, which they should term _Whittleation_,"
1770,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,and upon which they should base a new science and denominate it
1771,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,_Whittleology_. For what natural sensation is there which can be
1772,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,compared with that which is experienced while drawing the keen-edged
1773,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"blade through the delicate fibres of some soft, well-seasoned wood? So"
1774,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"far as my boyish experience extends, there is no enjoyment so deep, so"
1775,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"soothing, and so satisfactory as that derived from _whittling_; whether"
1776,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,it be upon a shingle or a school-bench—upon the squire’s picket-fence or
1777,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,the village sign-post. But to my dream. All things went on charmingly
1778,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,until an unfortunate turn of my shingle brought my knife-blade in
1779,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"contact with one of my fingers, and the pain of the wound thus"
1780,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"inflicted, dispelled the delightful vision which had enthralled me. And"
1781,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"so impatient was I to have Monday morning come round, that I could sleep"
1782,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"no more that night, and, although it was but an hour before daybreak,"
1783,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"still it appeared to me that weeks were crowded into that short period,"
1784,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,while I was waiting and watching for the blessed dawn of the Sabbath.
1785,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"Finally, daylight appeared; and with its earliest dawn I arose and began"
1786,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"to whistle “Heigh Betty Martin,” in great glee; but on recollection of"
1787,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"my treaty with mother, I ceased whistling and walked down into the"
1788,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"sitting-room with all the assumed gravity of a Friar Tuck, and with a"
1789,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"face long as a grape-vine, and sombre as a dying cypress. I attended"
1790,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"church all day, and did not take my eyes off the minister, except during"
1791,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"prayers; but sat up in the pew straight as a new pin, the big drops,"
1792,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"(not _tear_ drops, however,) following each other down my cheeks and"
1793,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"neck at stated intervals, much as though a frozen squash was _thawing_"
1794,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"on my head. After returning from church I took up my catechism, and when"
1795,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"I thought mother’s eyes were on me, my own were on the book; but when"
1796,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"she was out of the room I amused my little brother Dick, by telling him"
1797,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"in a whisper sufficiently loud to be heard over all the room, that"
1798,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1799,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,“In Adam’s fall
1800,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"We made stone-wall,"
1801,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,But ever _sense_
1802,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,We’ve made brush-fence.”

1810,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"’Gainst the Hes_shun_,” etc. etc."
1811,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1812,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"But as mother did not hear me, my youthful conscience was perfectly at"
1813,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"ease—considering, of course, that there was no wrong done when there was"
1814,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"no knowledge, on her part, of any transgression."
1815,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1816,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"At length, after many weary hours, _sun-down_ was proclaimed through the"
1817,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"house by my little sister Mary, who had been watching its approach, for"
1818,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"an hour or more, from one of the garret windows. I then made noise"
1819,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,enough to remunerate me for keeping half a score of Sabbaths. I mounted
1820,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,my Eclipse broomstick with a determination to run him on the course for
1821,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"the last time, previous to giving up the pleasures of the chase for the"
1822,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"quiet comforts of _whittling_. And, indeed, it _was_ the last time; for,"
1823,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"in the last quarter of the third heat, in the exuberance of my spirits I"
1824,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"reared up, and, my foot slipping, I came with such force on to my"
1825,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"wayworn charger that I broke him down, and into two pieces besides; and,"
1826,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"in addition, I got a severe thump on my cranium, which sent me weeping"
1827,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"to bed, where I slept quietly until Monday morning. On that morning I"
1828,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"was, of course, in very good spirits, and did not fail to give mother a"
1829,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"gentle hint touching her part of the contract, by taking _particular"
1830,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,pains_ to have her _accidentally_ discover that the handle to the
1831,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"clothes-pounder had come out, and by _carelessly_ observing, in a very"
1832,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_emphatic_ manner, that _if_ I had a penknife, I would make a wedge and"
1833,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"fasten in the pounder handle, etc. However, that day and the following"
1834,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,night were doomed to be hours of anxious suspense to me—hope and fear
1835,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,holding alternate sway in my excited breast. But words have not power to
1836,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"express the fulness of my joy when, after breakfast on Tuesday morning,"
1837,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"father called me to him, and, taking a new knife from his pocket, placed"
1838,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"me on his knee, after which he gave me several sections of good advice"
1839,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and kind admonitions, to which I listened with all the attention"
1840,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"bestowed by a barn upon a whirlwind, so deeply was I engaged in"
1841,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,scrutinizing the new object of my desire.
1842,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1843,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"When father had finished his lecture, it was _school-time_; so, after"
1844,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_greasing_ the spring of my new knife, grasping it firmly in my right"
1845,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"hand, and thrusting said hand into my pantaloons pocket, I started for"
1846,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"school, anticipating a “glorious triumph” in exhibiting my"
1847,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"newly-acquired property to my less fortunate playmates. But, just as I"
1848,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"stepped on to the school-house green, the schoolmistress _rattled the"
1849,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,window_ and called the children in; and thus my thrilling hopes were
1850,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,prematurely blighted. Still firmly holding my knife in my pocket as I
1851,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"entered the school-house, I took my seat on the “_big bench_” where I"
1852,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"usually sat, and after the school operations had fairly commenced, I"
1853,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,turned round to the desk with my back to the mistress and my book before
1854,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,me. I then took out my new knife for the purpose of examining it more
1855,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,particularly than I had hitherto done. It was of that kind commonly
1856,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"called _Barlow_ knives, one half of the handle being of polished iron"
1857,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and the other half of bone; the blade about four inches long, half an"
1858,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"inch wide near the handle, and tapering to a point. Bill Williams, who"
1859,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"sat next to me, soon got a glimpse at it, and we soon got _whispering_"
1860,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"about it; and the consequence was, we both got shut up in the _dungeon_,"
1861,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,and were kept there until noon. Great was my joy during the _noon-spell_
1862,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,in exhibiting my new treasure; and many were the congratulations which I
1863,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"received upon the pleasure of possessing it. In the afternoon, not"
1864,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"profiting at all by my morning’s experience, I took it out in"
1865,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,school-time and tried its shaving powers by cutting the bench; which the
1866,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"schoolmistress happening to discover, she took it away from me, gave me"
1867,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"a feruling, kept me half an hour after school was out; then, after"
1868,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"giving me a long lecture, and at the end of it my knife, she sent me"
1869,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,home. There I had a fine opportunity to indulge my whittling
1870,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"propensities during the whole evening; but finding my knife rather dull,"
1871,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,I stole into the dining-room and stole out of a drawer in the sideboard
1872,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"my father’s razor-hone, which I took out under the wood-house and there"
1873,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"gave my knife a grand rubbing. Unfortunately for me, however, the more I"
1874,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"sharpened it the duller it grew, and the more it spoiled my father’s"
1875,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"hone; for, on bringing this latter to the light, I found it was a good"
1876,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,deal worn and very much scratched. Here was a new difficulty; a good
1877,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"scolding, and perhaps a “_dressing_,” for spoiling a nice razor-hone."
1878,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"However, I put it slyly back into the drawer and determined to say"
1879,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"nothing about it, knowing that father would discover it the next time he"
1880,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"shaved himself; at which time I should endeavor—accidentally, of"
1881,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,course—to be _absent_.
1882,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1883,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"I next tried to sharpen my knife upon a scythe-stone; but, as Dan"
1884,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"O’Rourke would say, “the more I tried to give it an edge, the more it"
1885,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"would ‘not take one,’” until, finally, from desperate necessity, I came"
1886,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,to the grievous conclusion that my knife was good for nothing.
1887,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"Consequent upon this conclusion, was a determination to get rid of it as"
1888,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"soon as possible. But, alas! here was only the beginning of my sorrows,"
1889,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,as the sequel will show.
1890,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1891,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,My first attempt was to _swop_ it away; but as none of the boys had such
1892,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"a knife as I wanted, this could not be done. I next called my younger"
1893,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"brother Dick to me, and asked him if he did not want a _present_? He, of"
1894,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"course, answered in the affirmative. Thereupon, after showing him my"
1895,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"knife, how well it was _sharpened up_, etc., and making him promise to"
1896,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,carry my books to and from the school-house during the remainder of the
1897,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"summer, I made him a _present_ of the knife. He was exceedingly"
1898,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"delighted with this acquisition to his personal property, and"
1899,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,immediately ran into the yard to find something to whittle. I looked
1900,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,through the window to watch his success. He first picked up a decayed
1901,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"mullen stalk, and attempted to cut off the end; but, instead of"
1902,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_cutting_ it off, the pressure of his knife _broke_ it off close by his"
1903,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"hand. He next picked up the end of an ox-goad, and tugged away at it,"
1904,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"turning his head sidewise, and twisting his tongue and mouth into all"
1905,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"manner of shapes, but _not a shaving could he raise_! He then found a"
1906,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"piece of pine shingle, which he succeeded in splitting lengthwise, but"
1907,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"could neither _sharpen_ nor _round_ it. Just then, two of his playmates"
1908,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"coming along with a ball, Dick put his knife into his pocket, and went"
1909,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"to join them in a game of “_one-old-cat_.” I thought to myself, as I was"
1910,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"almost bursting with laughter, “I was _very_ fortunate in getting rid of"
1911,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_that_ knife at any rate.” On the following morning, father went to get"
1912,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"his shaving apparatus, and, of course, discovered his ruined hone."
1913,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"However, as soon as I saw him start for the sideboard drawer, I started"
1914,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"for the wood-house chamber, where I lay concealed until school-time. I"
1915,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"went to school with the determination not to go home at noon, and"
1916,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,supposed that by night the hone business would all be got along with.
1917,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,But my hopes were again doomed to disappointment; for when father came
1918,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"home in the evening, he asked me if I had “been using his hone?” Now, as"
1919,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"I had been taught that, let consequences be what they might, I must"
1920,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"never tell a _lie_; true to _such_ instructions, I promptly"
1921,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"answered—“Yes, sir.” “For what purpose?” he inquired. “To sharpen my"
1922,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"knife,” I answered. “Well,” said he, “as you are so fond of sharpening"
1923,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"knives, go get the case-knife your mother lends you, and sharpen that.”"
1924,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"Accordingly, I got the case-knife, and he got the hone, and I went to"
1925,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_honing_, and he went to reading the newspapers. Now, the case-knife was"
1926,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"a good deal like my Barlow knife; the more you _sharpened_ it, the"
1927,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_duller_ it grew. After rubbing it about half an hour, being somewhat"
1928,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"tired, I took it to father, and told him “it would not come sharp.” “Oh,"
1929,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"well,” said he, “you have not honed it long enough; it is a knife, and,"
1930,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"of course, can be sharpened. Try it again.” So at it I went once more;"
1931,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and, after rubbing it until my mouth was dry as a cotton-bag, and my arm"
1932,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"almost exhausted, I took it again to father, and, with tears in my eyes,"
1933,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"told him “it would _not be sharpened_.” “Well, my son,” said he, “when I"
1934,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"questioned you about the hone, you promptly told me the truth; for this"
1935,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"I commend you, and I have made you hone the case-knife as a punishment"
1936,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,for spoiling my hone. Now the next time you want a razor-hone to sharpen
1937,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"a Barlow knife upon, you must ask for it.” I made divers promises on the"
1938,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"subject, and fully resolved, in my own mind, that I never would use his"
1939,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,hone again without permission.
1940,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1941,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,On the following Sunday morning I put on my best suit to attend church;
1942,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and, after I had got down into the parlor, I unconsciously thrust my"
1943,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"hand into my coat pocket, and great was my surprise when I drew from it"
1944,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"my _Barlow knife_. “Dick,” said I, “did you put _your_ knife into my"
1945,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"pocket?” “That’s not _my_ knife,” said Dick. “Don’t you want it?” I"
1946,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,asked. “No!” he answered. “Why not?” I inquired. “Because it will not
1947,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_cut any_,” rejoined Dick; “and I shall not carry your books this summer"
1948,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"for _such_ a knife as that,” and thereupon he hopped out of the room."
1949,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"The next day, while up in the orchard, back of the school-house, I"
1950,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"contrived to have it slip out of my pocket, and satisfied my conscience"
1951,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,by telling myself that I had lost it. More than a week had I passed in
1952,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"the enjoyment of this quiet, pleasing consciousness of having lost my"
1953,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"knife, when, one morning as I was going to school, Bill Williams ran up"
1954,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"to me, saying, “Bob, here’s your knife: I found it under the big sweet"
1955,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"apple-tree.” “Botheration take the knife,” I thought, as I put it into"
1956,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"my pocket. After school was out at night, I went up the road some"
1957,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"distance from the school-house, to a _sand-pit_, from which the"
1958,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,neighbors occasionally got a load of _scrubbing-sand_. Here I dug a hole
1959,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"as deep as I could, threw in my knife, buried it up, and went away,"
1960,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,rejoicing in the belief that I should never see it again.
1961,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1962,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"About two weeks after this, Peleg Bunce, my father’s hired man, was"
1963,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"sent, by mother, to get a load of scrubbing-sand; and when I came home"
1964,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"from school Peleg said to me, “Robert, here’s your knife,” at the same"
1965,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"time reaching it to me. “My knife!” I exclaimed, in a manner and with"
1966,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"feelings compounded of sanity and insanity. “_Divil_ burn the knife,” I"
1967,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"whispered to myself, not wishing to speak a bad word distinctly. Peleg"
1968,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"found it in the sand-pit; and he knew it was mine, for he once borrowed"
1969,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"it of me to make a _bow-pin_ for old _Brin_—but returned it, of course,"
1970,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"without accomplishing his object. Once more I put it in my pocket, and"
1971,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"began to reflect how I should ever get entirely rid of it. At last, a"
1972,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"plan occurred to me, which I conceived to be faultless. There was a"
1973,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"_pond_ near my father’s house, at the outlet of which stood a large"
1974,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"blast furnace. I determined to _drown_ my knife. Accordingly, lest its"
1975,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"own weight should not be sufficient to keep it at the bottom, and to"
1976,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"make “assurance doubly sure,” I got from the barn a piece of halter with"
1977,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"which I tied a pretty good sized stone to my knife, and threw it into"
1978,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,the furnace-pond. And great was my joy to see it turn and turn around
1979,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"until it sank out of my sight. Soon as it had fairly disappeared, I"
1980,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,fetched a heavy sigh of mingled joy and suspense—then turned home with a
1981,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"light and happy heart. Sweet was my rest that night, and pleasant were"
1982,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"my dreams. Week after week passed away, and my old knife likewise passed"
1983,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,into oblivion.
1984,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
1985,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"One bright and beautiful morning in October, old Russell Case and his"
1986,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"two sons came down from the mountain on which they lived, to fish in the"
1987,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"pond; and as they were notorious fishermen, they generally had quite a"
1988,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,company of boys to watch their operations. As it was not yet
1989,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"school-time, Bill Williams and myself went to see them draw their seine."
1990,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"They took a good sweep into the pond with their boat, then came on shore"
1991,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and commenced hauling in. We were all anxiously watching for the fish,"
1992,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and nearly the whole of them had been emptied on the beach, when Bill"
1993,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"Williams exclaimed, “Why, Bob, _there’s your knife_!” And sure enough,"
1994,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"on hauling in the last joint of the seine, what should be hanging to it"
1995,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,but my knife with the string and stone attached to it! Perfectly
1996,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"astounded at this discovery, I could almost have prayed that the waters"
1997,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"might rise and overwhelm seine, fishermen and all! However, the thing"
1998,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,was easily explained; for the piece of halter which I used happened to
1999,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"have been made of _hemp_, and the _knife_ not being as heavy as the"
2000,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"string, while the stone lay on the bottom, _that_ was elevated some"
2001,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"inches from it, and so the fishermen caught it."
2002,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,
2003,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"Once more, with a heavy heart, I put that old knife in my pocket. A deep"
2004,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"feeling of disappointment and melancholy took possession of my mind, and"
2005,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,long and seriously did I ponder upon the best means of ridding myself of
2006,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,this tantalizing treasure. In vain had I endeavored to _give it away_—in
2007,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"vain, to lose it—in vain, to drown it. Light, at last, seemed to dawn"
2008,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"through the gloom that had gathered upon me, and my resolution was soon"
2009,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"taken. I repaired one evening to the furnace—went into the top-house,"
2010,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,and there waited until they began to put in their hourly supply of coal
2011,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,and ore. I then thrust my knife into the box of ore which I thought the
2012,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,_filler_ would put in first. I did not wish to throw it directly into
2013,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"the top myself, for this would seem like doing an evil deed, and such a"
2014,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,one I did not wish to do. Strongly and quickly did my heart beat as I
2015,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"watched the baskets of coal disappear; and, finally, my whole frame"
2016,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,shook with agitation when I saw the filler take the box of ore which
2017,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"contained my knife, and toss its contents into the furnace! A long-drawn"
2018,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"sigh gave vent to the conflicting emotions which had agitated my mind,"
2019,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"and I turned homeward with a feeling of deep, almost overwhelming"
2020,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"satisfaction and delight, that my eyes had certainly beheld, for the"
2021,BY ROBERT JONATHAN.,"last time, my old BARLOW KNIFE!"

2197,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“And now brother is sorry for doing wrong, and has made it all up with"
2198,A JUVENILE STORY.,"cousin George, you _will_ tell us a story, won’t you, dear grandmother?”"
2199,A JUVENILE STORY.,"said Helen, a child of seven years, who was leaning over the arm of Mrs."
2200,A JUVENILE STORY.,Gray’s chair.
2201,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2202,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“And do tell one pitty long,” said little Mary, a lisping infant of"
2203,A JUVENILE STORY.,"three years, laying her curly head in her grandmother’s lap."
2204,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2205,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Now that peace is restored, my children,” said Mrs. Gray, looking"
2206,A JUVENILE STORY.,"fondly upon each one of the little flock that gathered round her, “I"
2207,A JUVENILE STORY.,will tell you a story of one from whom we are all descended.”
2208,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2209,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Was her name Gray?” asked Ann, eagerly."
2210,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2211,A JUVENILE STORY.,“Not at the period to which our story refers; though afterwards it
2212,A JUVENILE STORY.,became so.”
2213,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2214,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“We are in haste for you to begin,” said Henry, hurrying books, maps,"
2215,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and pictures, without any order, into a table drawer."
2216,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2217,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Don’t be impatient, child—old folks never like to be hurried,” said"
2218,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Mrs. Gray; “and I’ve a good will not to tell you any story at all, just"
2219,A JUVENILE STORY.,for huddling up your things in such a slovenly manner.”
2220,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2221,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Forgive poor Henry once again,” said the good-natured Ann, “and I will"
2222,A JUVENILE STORY.,"put them all nice;” and she took the things all out of the drawer, and"
2223,A JUVENILE STORY.,"placed the books neatly in the book-case, and laid the maps and pictures"
2224,A JUVENILE STORY.,"into a portfolio; and when she had done she said, “Now, grandmother, are"
2225,A JUVENILE STORY.,you not ready?”
2226,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2227,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Not quite yet,” said Mrs. Gray, with an affectionate smile; “you, my"
2228,A JUVENILE STORY.,"dear Ann, are such a neat little girl, I’m sure you will be willing to"
2229,A JUVENILE STORY.,wait till Sally has swept the hearth and replenished the fire.”
2230,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2231,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Replenished is among my definitions,” said little Helen; “but I didn’t"
2232,A JUVENILE STORY.,know that it had any thing to do with making a fire.”
2233,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2234,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Making a fire!” repeated George; “didn’t I tell you only yesterday,"
2235,A JUVENILE STORY.,"that we cannot _make_ fire, but only kindle it?”"
2236,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2237,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Yes, you did tell me so, to be sure; but I didn’t believe you. I guess"
2238,A JUVENILE STORY.,if you had been here the other night when the Universalist Chapel was
2239,A JUVENILE STORY.,"burnt, you would think somebody could make a fire—and a pretty large"
2240,A JUVENILE STORY.,"one, too.”"
2241,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2242,A JUVENILE STORY.,“Can you tell me the meaning of the word replenish?” asked Mrs. Gray.
2243,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2244,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Why, replenish means—it means—to fill up, I believe; but I don’t see as"
2245,A JUVENILE STORY.,"that has anything to do with fire, after all.”"
2246,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2247,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Why if we add wood to the fire, and so fill up, or nearly fill up, the"
2248,A JUVENILE STORY.,"fireplace, may it not be called replenishing? You commence the critic"
2249,A JUVENILE STORY.,"early, child,” said the grandmother; but she was far from being angry"
2250,A JUVENILE STORY.,with little Helen for her remarks; “for it is right and proper for
2251,A JUVENILE STORY.,"children to inquire, and understand, and learn all they can.”"
2252,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2253,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“But, grandmother,” said George, “I have placed your chair in the"
2254,A JUVENILE STORY.,"warmest corner—the fire _is_ replenished, if Miss Helen will allow me to"
2255,A JUVENILE STORY.,"say so—the hearth is swept—Sally has got her knitting, and is going to"
2256,A JUVENILE STORY.,"sit down with us—and we are all ready, and impatient to hear you.”"
2257,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2258,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“I wish father and mother would be out at a party every night,” said"
2259,A JUVENILE STORY.,"little Helen, as the circle of happy and inquisitive children took their"
2260,A JUVENILE STORY.,"respective seats, and drew around Mrs. Gray; “for you, dear grandmother,"
2261,A JUVENILE STORY.,"always sit with us when they are out; and so do brother, and cousin Ann,"
2262,A JUVENILE STORY.,and George—and we have such happy times!”
2263,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2264,A JUVENILE STORY.,"The good lady drew the youngest child to her arms; and, taking the hand"
2265,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of Helen, who had drawn her little chair very close to her grandmother,"
2266,A JUVENILE STORY.,thus began:
2267,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2268,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“It was a cold night in December, 1664. The winter wind was howling"
2269,A JUVENILE STORY.,"among the bare forest-trees, and whistling through the heavy and open"
2270,A JUVENILE STORY.,"casements of a few small houses, which stood in the midst of the"
2271,A JUVENILE STORY.,"wilderness, upon a spot then mostly known as the Plantations. It was"
2272,A JUVENILE STORY.,Sabbath evening. The family belonging to one of the most comfortable
2273,A JUVENILE STORY.,"looking houses rose up slowly from their usual evening devotions, and"
2274,A JUVENILE STORY.,drew round a large and blazing fire. The snow and hail beat furiously
2275,A JUVENILE STORY.,"against the one window of the room, and for some minutes no one spoke:"
2276,A JUVENILE STORY.,and then they heard a low groan as of one in the agonies of death; and
2277,A JUVENILE STORY.,this was followed by a faint screech and a moan of distress.
2278,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2279,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘The Indians! the Indians!’ cried a boy about six years old, and he hid"
2280,A JUVENILE STORY.,his little head in his mother’s lap.
2281,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2282,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Nobody shall hurt my boy!’ said the father, patting his head, ‘nobody"
2283,A JUVENILE STORY.,"shall harm thee, child;’ and he rose up, and putting on a broad-brimmed"
2284,A JUVENILE STORY.,"hat turned up at the sides, and taking an iron-headed cane, he began to"
2285,A JUVENILE STORY.,unfasten the door.
2286,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2287,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Thou wilt not, Simon Gray,’ said the wife, laying a hand on his arm,"
2288,A JUVENILE STORY.,‘thou wilt not open our dwelling to the enemy?’
2289,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2290,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Thy fears are natural, Rebecca,’ said the husband, turning with"
2291,A JUVENILE STORY.,"momentary hesitation, ‘for verily, hath the cunning enemy been as a"
2292,A JUVENILE STORY.,snake in the grass to the Lord’s people.’
2293,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2294,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Look forth from the window, first, then,’ said the wife; ‘hast thou"
2295,A JUVENILE STORY.,lived so long in the wilderness and not learned that the wicked one is
2296,A JUVENILE STORY.,"full of snares?’ But a succession of low groans, apparently near the"
2297,A JUVENILE STORY.,"house, overcame his fears; and hastily unfastening and throwing open the"
2298,A JUVENILE STORY.,"narrow door, he said, ‘Farewell, Rebecca—the arm of the Lord is forever"
2299,A JUVENILE STORY.,with his children!’
2300,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2301,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Forsake me not, Simon,’ said Mrs. Gray, lifting the little boy to her"
2302,A JUVENILE STORY.,"arms, ‘I will go with thee;’ but he had already passed the threshold and"
2303,A JUVENILE STORY.,thrown open the gate that led from the little enclosure around their
2304,A JUVENILE STORY.,dwelling. He paused; listened again; and passed into the street. The
2305,A JUVENILE STORY.,"cries were repeated, but not so loud or so frequently as they had been."
2306,A JUVENILE STORY.,"He paused again and looked around, but still saw nothing but the thick"
2307,A JUVENILE STORY.,"falling snow, which beat so heavily as to obscure almost everything;"
2308,A JUVENILE STORY.,"besides, it was very dark."
2309,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2310,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Who was it, grandmother?” whispered Helen, “who was it?”"
2311,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2312,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Hush, sister!” said Henry, “she was just going to tell.”"
2313,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2314,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Again,” resumed Mrs. Gray, “again he heard the same low cry; and just"
2315,A JUVENILE STORY.,"as his wife came up, he stumbled upon a human figure crouched at the"
2316,A JUVENILE STORY.,"foot of a very large snow-bank. It proved to be an Indian woman, almost"
2317,A JUVENILE STORY.,perished with cold and hunger.
2318,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2319,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘The Lord be praised! and bless thee, Simon Gray!’ said Rebecca, as she"
2320,A JUVENILE STORY.,assisted her husband to lift the poor creature from the earth; ‘the Lord
2321,A JUVENILE STORY.,be magnified!’
2322,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2323,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Leave Namoina, take de baby!’ said the poor creature in broken"
2324,A JUVENILE STORY.,"English, and she pointed to a dark heap at a little distance; but at the"
2325,A JUVENILE STORY.,"instant William had reached the spot, and, as his mother came up, he"
2326,A JUVENILE STORY.,uncovered the face of a sleeping infant. The little creature was wrapped
2327,A JUVENILE STORY.,"in a thick covering of blankets, and was sleeping as peacefully amid the"
2328,A JUVENILE STORY.,snow as if it was lying in its own mother’s bosom.
2329,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2330,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Rebecca knelt beside the little one, and blessed God that she had been"
2331,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the instrument of saving its life. The falling snow, and the cold wind"
2332,A JUVENILE STORY.,"blowing upon the child’s face, awoke it; and as it opened its eyes it"
2333,A JUVENILE STORY.,"looked up in the face of Rebecca, who was kneeling beside it with a"
2334,A JUVENILE STORY.,"lantern in her hand, and smiled, and lifted up its little arms."
2335,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2336,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘The Lord has sent thee to me,’ said Mrs. Gray, while her heart was"
2337,A JUVENILE STORY.,"filled with tenderness. ‘The Lord has sent thee to me, to lie in my"
2338,A JUVENILE STORY.,bosom and be unto me instead of my own little buried Rebecca!’
2339,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2340,A JUVENILE STORY.,“The good man and his wife were not long in removing the poor Indian
2341,A JUVENILE STORY.,"woman and the child to the house, and, for some time, the poor creature"
2342,A JUVENILE STORY.,did not appear to know what was passing around her; but after having
2343,A JUVENILE STORY.,"taken some hot drink she seemed to revive, and cried out, ‘Me baby! me"
2344,A JUVENILE STORY.,flower!’ and she looked wildly round for the child. Mrs. Gray laid it on
2345,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the mat beside her, and the little one sat up and twisted its little"
2346,A JUVENILE STORY.,"fingers in her wet black hair, and then nestled close to the Indian"
2347,A JUVENILE STORY.,woman’s bosom till she slept. Mrs. Gray then carefully removed the
2348,A JUVENILE STORY.,"child, and fed it with some warm milk. The poor little thing, as if"
2349,A JUVENILE STORY.,"conscious of her kindness, looked up in her face and softly repeated,"
2350,A JUVENILE STORY.,‘Mamma—mamma.’ The imperfect words went to the heart of Rebecca; and she
2351,A JUVENILE STORY.,"again resolved that, as the Lord had cast the little stranger upon her"
2352,A JUVENILE STORY.,"protection, she would be unto it a mother."
2353,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2354,A JUVENILE STORY.,“Mr. and Mrs. Gray hoped to learn something of the child when the Indian
2355,A JUVENILE STORY.,"woman should be restored, but they were disappointed; for she arose at"
2356,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the dawn of day, and stealing softly to the bedside of Mrs. Gray, and"
2357,A JUVENILE STORY.,"taking the child from beside its new mother, she appeared about to carry"
2358,A JUVENILE STORY.,"it away; but Mrs. Gray, as she awoke, observing her, cried out, ‘Give me"
2359,A JUVENILE STORY.,back the babe! give her to me!’
2360,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2361,A JUVENILE STORY.,“The Indian woman fixed her piercing black eyes upon the face of Rebecca
2362,A JUVENILE STORY.,"for several minutes, then closing them, she appeared to be reasoning"
2363,A JUVENILE STORY.,"with herself; for, upon lifting them again, she said, solemnly, ‘The God"
2364,A JUVENILE STORY.,of the white man calleth for his child. The rose cannot bloom in the
2365,A JUVENILE STORY.,desert. The lily springeth not in the wilderness.’
2366,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2367,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Thus saying, she chanted a kind of prayer in the Indian tongue, and"
2368,A JUVENILE STORY.,"folding the babe an instant to her bosom, she replaced it beside Mrs."
2369,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Gray; and before any one could speak or prevent her, she had thrown open"
2370,A JUVENILE STORY.,the door and passed swiftly from the cottage.
2371,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2372,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Rise, Simon Gray!’ said the kind-hearted Rebecca, ‘rise and follow the"
2373,A JUVENILE STORY.,"poor creature, and persuade her to stay till the storm is past, and"
2374,A JUVENILE STORY.,offer her food.’ But though the good man made all possible haste in
2375,A JUVENILE STORY.,"dressing, the woman had reached the summit of a high hill which lay"
2376,A JUVENILE STORY.,toward the Bay colony ere he got into the street; and soon she was lost
2377,A JUVENILE STORY.,"in the distance and the thick falling snow, which was still beating down"
2378,A JUVENILE STORY.,with great violence.”
2379,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2380,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Did she freeze to death, grandmother?” asked Helen."
2381,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2382,A JUVENILE STORY.,“Did she never return?” inquired Henry.
2383,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2384,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“You’ll both get answered when grandmother has finished her story,” said"
2385,A JUVENILE STORY.,"George Gray, with a shrewd look to his cousins."
2386,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2387,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Yes, all in good time, children,” said Mrs. Gray, as she resumed. “They"
2388,A JUVENILE STORY.,"could not possibly find out how the Indian woman came by the child, or,"
2389,A JUVENILE STORY.,"for certainty, who she was; yet by her calling herself Namoina, they"
2390,A JUVENILE STORY.,"supposed she must be a woman who was called by her tribe cunning, and"
2391,A JUVENILE STORY.,"revered as a prophetess, though the white people knew that the poor"
2392,A JUVENILE STORY.,creature was at times crazy; for she had seen her husband and child
2393,A JUVENILE STORY.,"bleed, both in one day; the first fell and died while defending his"
2394,A JUVENILE STORY.,home; the other was inhumanly murdered by wretches who deserved not the
2395,A JUVENILE STORY.,"name of men! And so poor Namoina, or, as the white people called her,"
2396,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Rachel, went crazy."
2397,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2398,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Mrs. Gray found, by a medal that hung round the infant’s neck, that her"
2399,A JUVENILE STORY.,name was Mary Wallace; and Mary Wallace she was called. She appeared to
2400,A JUVENILE STORY.,"be about a year old. She was a fine, healthy child, and soon grew"
2401,A JUVENILE STORY.,"nicely, and Mr. and Mrs. Gray were very fond of her; and William called"
2402,A JUVENILE STORY.,"her his little sister, and taught her to walk, and gave her more than"
2403,A JUVENILE STORY.,half of all the nice things he had—(they did not have sugarplums and
2404,A JUVENILE STORY.,"candy then, but children were better off without them, and a great deal"
2405,A JUVENILE STORY.,"more healthy)—and he would tell her pretty stories, and drag her in his"
2406,A JUVENILE STORY.,little wagon; and he loved her dearly. She was a sweet-tempered and
2407,A JUVENILE STORY.,"lovely child, and very seldom did any thing to displease her parents;"
2408,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and when she did she would grieve very much, and she never could be"
2409,A JUVENILE STORY.,"happy till she was forgiven. When she was twelve years old, there was"
2410,A JUVENILE STORY.,"not a fairer or lovelier child in the whole Providence Plantations, than"
2411,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Mary Wallace. Her eyes were bright and blue; her long, light brown hair"
2412,A JUVENILE STORY.,"fell in beautiful curls upon her shoulders, and her voice had such a"
2413,A JUVENILE STORY.,"sweet and happy tone, and her countenance such an amiable expression,"
2414,A JUVENILE STORY.,"that the young loved her without envy, and the old never passed her"
2415,A JUVENILE STORY.,without a blessing. The lark did not rise earlier than Mary Wallace. The
2416,A JUVENILE STORY.,"first thing in the morning she would be seen with a basket on her arm,"
2417,A JUVENILE STORY.,"tripping lightly over the grass, with her little white feet scattering"
2418,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the dew, and singing sweetly and merrily as the birds themselves. No one"
2419,A JUVENILE STORY.,in the Plantations had not felt her kindness; she always had an arm for
2420,A JUVENILE STORY.,the aged—some little delicacy for the sick—tears for the suffering—songs
2421,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and smiles for the happy—and bread, and beer, and pity, even for the"
2422,A JUVENILE STORY.,"poor Indian. In short, the good people of the Plantations believed,"
2423,A JUVENILE STORY.,"that, by a special mercy of Divine Providence, she had been sent among"
2424,A JUVENILE STORY.,them. She was of great assistance to her parents. They believed that
2425,A JUVENILE STORY.,they could not do without her. In the spring she helped plant the corn
2426,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and beans—weeded the vegetable beds in the garden—and, through all the"
2427,A JUVENILE STORY.,"warm season, she drove home the cows at night—fed the sheep and pigs—and"
2428,A JUVENILE STORY.,"took care of the hens, ducks, geese, and their little ones. In the"
2429,A JUVENILE STORY.,summer she gathered berries and laid in herbs for winter. In autumn she
2430,A JUVENILE STORY.,"helped harvest the corn—gathered the dry beans and peas, and did a great"
2431,A JUVENILE STORY.,"many other useful things; and in the winter she sat, for the most part,"
2432,A JUVENILE STORY.,"by the fireside, knitting stockings for the family, and mending her own"
2433,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and William’s clothes—or she read the Bible, of a long Sabbath evening,"
2434,A JUVENILE STORY.,to her father and mother: she was never idle.
2435,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2436,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Mary never knew, till she was ten years old, but that she was the"
2437,A JUVENILE STORY.,daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Gray. At this time her mother thought best to
2438,A JUVENILE STORY.,"inform her how she had been brought to them. She was grieved, at first,"
2439,A JUVENILE STORY.,and cried very hard; but she could not comprehend how it was possible
2440,A JUVENILE STORY.,that they who had watched her—nursed her—loved and supported her from
2441,A JUVENILE STORY.,"earliest infancy, should not be her own father, and mother, and brother;"
2442,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and, instead of indulging childish curiosity respecting her real"
2443,A JUVENILE STORY.,"parents, she treated the whole as an unpleasant story, and strove to"
2444,A JUVENILE STORY.,"forget it; and, with her sweet, happy disposition, she was not long in"
2445,A JUVENILE STORY.,doing this; and very soon she smiled as sweetly—and sang as merrily—and
2446,A JUVENILE STORY.,"danced as gaily over the meadows, as she had done before. About this"
2447,A JUVENILE STORY.,"time a distressing war broke out, called ‘King Philip’s War;’ and the"
2448,A JUVENILE STORY.,"times were more distressing than you, my dear children, can well"
2449,A JUVENILE STORY.,imagine. There is no correct history of those times; but the most
2450,A JUVENILE STORY.,considerable account you will find in Captain ‘Church’s History of
2451,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Philip’s War.’ The Indians, when they took any of the white people"
2452,A JUVENILE STORY.,"prisoners, treated them very cruelly; and, sometimes, put them to death"
2453,A JUVENILE STORY.,with great torture.”
2454,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2455,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“I’ve read all about that, and I don’t blame the Indians at all!” said"
2456,A JUVENILE STORY.,"George Gray, starting to his feet with much earnestness, while his eyes"
2457,A JUVENILE STORY.,almost flashed fire; “what right had the white people to come here and
2458,A JUVENILE STORY.,cheat them—and rob them of their lands—and drive them from their houses?
2459,A JUVENILE STORY.,Philip was a noble fellow! If I had lived then I would have been on his
2460,A JUVENILE STORY.,side—at any rate—_I would_!!”
2461,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2462,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“And, brother,” said Ann, catching some of his warmth, “don’t you"
2463,A JUVENILE STORY.,remember what our last fourth of July orator said of Philip?”
2464,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2465,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Yes,” returned George, quickly, “these were his very words: ‘Philip,"
2466,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the hero of Mount Hope, though a savage, was a man—and a _noble man_—and"
2467,A JUVENILE STORY.,"had he lived in other times and other circumstances, he might have been"
2468,A JUVENILE STORY.,"a Cæsar—an Alexander—a Napoleon:—and what is saying more, and the most"
2469,A JUVENILE STORY.,that can be said of any man—a Washington!’” and the boy walked the room
2470,A JUVENILE STORY.,"quickly, while his burning cheek and flashing eye told that his spirit"
2471,A JUVENILE STORY.,was getting too strong for his young bosom.
2472,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2473,A JUVENILE STORY.,“We will not dispute now whether the English or the Indians were right
2474,A JUVENILE STORY.,"or wrong,” said the prudent grandmother. “Doubtless they were both to"
2475,A JUVENILE STORY.,"blame. Well, when Mary Wallace was about ten years old, and her brother"
2476,A JUVENILE STORY.,"fifteen, Mr. Gray and William went to join the forces of Captain Church."
2477,A JUVENILE STORY.,Mary it was who buckled on their knapsacks and pinned their collars on
2478,A JUVENILE STORY.,the morning of their first departure. She would not have cried a single
2479,A JUVENILE STORY.,"tear if she could have avoided it, because her mother was so much"
2480,A JUVENILE STORY.,"distressed; but it was such a dreadful thing to see them going away, and"
2481,A JUVENILE STORY.,"to think they might never return, that poor Mary sobbed and wept as if"
2482,A JUVENILE STORY.,"her heart was breaking; and when they said ‘farewell, Mary!’ her heart"
2483,A JUVENILE STORY.,was so full she could not speak; and when they stepped from the
2484,A JUVENILE STORY.,"threshold, poor Mary hid her face in her mother’s lap, because she could"
2485,A JUVENILE STORY.,"not bear to see them go. But after she had wept a while, Mrs. Gray wiped"
2486,A JUVENILE STORY.,away her tears and got the Bible and bade her read; and they were
2487,A JUVENILE STORY.,comforted.
2488,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2489,A JUVENILE STORY.,“Every morning and evening Mary Wallace knelt by her little bedside and
2490,A JUVENILE STORY.,prayed to God for the safe return of her father and brother. They came
2491,A JUVENILE STORY.,"home occasionally, but for the space of two years they were gone most of"
2492,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the time. They met, however, with no serious accident; and Mary and her"
2493,A JUVENILE STORY.,mother had much reason to be thankful.
2494,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2495,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“One pleasant day during the second summer of the war, Mary had taken"
2496,A JUVENILE STORY.,"her little basket, and calling Hunter, a large dog, she went to gather"
2497,A JUVENILE STORY.,"berries; but, not finding the fruit plenty, she wandered farther into"
2498,A JUVENILE STORY.,the woods than she should have done at that dangerous time. She was very
2499,A JUVENILE STORY.,"busy picking some nice large berries, which she had found in great"
2500,A JUVENILE STORY.,"abundance, when, presently, she thought she heard a groan; and, without"
2501,A JUVENILE STORY.,"waiting to think there might be danger, she swung her basket on her arm"
2502,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and skipped through the bushes, followed by Hunter. Very soon she saw a"
2503,A JUVENILE STORY.,large Indian seated upon a flat rock and leaning against a tree behind
2504,A JUVENILE STORY.,"him, with a tomahawk and a bundle of arrows laid at his side. Almost any"
2505,A JUVENILE STORY.,"little girl would have been frightened, and have run away crying; and,"
2506,A JUVENILE STORY.,"indeed, Mary Wallace herself felt that it might be wrong to approach him"
2507,A JUVENILE STORY.,"when she thought of her poor, lone mother; and she was just going to"
2508,A JUVENILE STORY.,"turn back and run home with all her might, when she saw that the poor"
2509,A JUVENILE STORY.,"man was pale and faint, and could not sit upright but for the tree"
2510,A JUVENILE STORY.,"against which he leaned. But what, in reality, could Mary have to fear?"
2511,A JUVENILE STORY.,"She was known to most of the tribes around, very few of whom had not, at"
2512,A JUVENILE STORY.,"some time or other, felt her kindness. Her little room was decorated"
2513,A JUVENILE STORY.,"with numerous tokens of Indian gratitude, in the shape of wampum belts"
2514,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and baskets, curious shells and stones, and many other things; and the"
2515,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Indians called her ‘the child of Sunshine’—‘the Flower’—‘the Lily,’ and"
2516,A JUVENILE STORY.,"many other endearing names; but mostly, ‘the Bird of Peace.’ Instead of"
2517,A JUVENILE STORY.,"running away, as she had at first thought to do, Mary drew near the"
2518,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Indian and saw that he was asleep, or had fainted from loss of blood,"
2519,A JUVENILE STORY.,which was flowing fast from a large wound in his leg. The sight of blood
2520,A JUVENILE STORY.,"naturally made Mary feel sick and dizzy; but, without hesitation, she"
2521,A JUVENILE STORY.,"took a little shawl from her neck and bound it round the limb. The dog,"
2522,A JUVENILE STORY.,"as soon as he smelt the blood, began to bark furiously; and this,"
2523,A JUVENILE STORY.,"together with the pain caused by binding the wound, aroused the Indian,"
2524,A JUVENILE STORY.,"who, thinking, probably, that the enemy had fallen upon him, clenched"
2525,A JUVENILE STORY.,"his tomahawk and uttered a fearful cry. Mary trembled an instant, as if"
2526,A JUVENILE STORY.,she already felt the blow; but she saw that he was still very faint;
2527,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and, taking courage, she caught his arm and said, in the Indian tongue,"
2528,A JUVENILE STORY.,"‘Fear not, father, it is Mary!’ and as he looked upon her, she pointed"
2529,A JUVENILE STORY.,to the limb which she had nearly bandaged. He appeared very grateful
2530,A JUVENILE STORY.,"when he saw what she had done, but he was too weak and faint to say"
2531,A JUVENILE STORY.,"much; and he only whispered, as he placed his hand on the child’s head,"
2532,A JUVENILE STORY.,"‘Welcome, daughter of Heaven!’"
2533,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2534,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Little Mary then ran home as fast as she could, and told her mother"
2535,A JUVENILE STORY.,"about the poor wounded man, and asked her for some food; and her mother"
2536,A JUVENILE STORY.,"gave her some new milk, and some beer, and bread. Mrs. Gray went out"
2537,A JUVENILE STORY.,with her and carried a blanket to cover him; and she bound up the wound
2538,A JUVENILE STORY.,"better than Mary could, putting on some healing balsam. They persuaded"
2539,A JUVENILE STORY.,"him to partake of the food; and, afterward, assisted him to a shelter"
2540,A JUVENILE STORY.,"under a rock, where they left him quite comfortable."
2541,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2542,A JUVENILE STORY.,“The next day Mary asked permission to go and carry food to the sick
2543,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Indian; and, calling Hunter, she took the basket her mother gave her,"
2544,A JUVENILE STORY.,and went to the woods. When she arrived at the rock she found that the
2545,A JUVENILE STORY.,sick man had risen and was seated on the top of the rock; and by his
2546,A JUVENILE STORY.,"side an Indian woman, who was caressing him with much affection. Little"
2547,A JUVENILE STORY.,Mary had come quite near before they saw her; for she stepped very
2548,A JUVENILE STORY.,"lightly; but as soon as the old man did perceive her, he said in"
2549,A JUVENILE STORY.,"English, ‘Behold the Bird of Peace!’ As he spoke the woman looked"
2550,A JUVENILE STORY.,"earnestly at Mary for several minutes, and then she cried out, ‘My lily!"
2551,A JUVENILE STORY.,"my blossom! my babee!’ and, springing from the rock, she caught the"
2552,A JUVENILE STORY.,child in her arms and almost suffocated her with tears and caresses.
2553,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2554,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Little Mary alarmed and strangely agitated, whispered, ‘Let me go home"
2555,A JUVENILE STORY.,to my mother—do let me go home!’
2556,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2557,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Thy mother!’ repeated the woman, ‘thy own mother is gone across the"
2558,A JUVENILE STORY.,"wide waters, far to the rising sun—and thy father,’ she pointed up to"
2559,A JUVENILE STORY.,"heaven, ‘it is twice five summers since thy father went to the hunting"
2560,A JUVENILE STORY.,grounds of the paleface—he died—he was murdered; and so was my own
2561,A JUVENILE STORY.,little blossom—my own babe!’ Her voice was choked—she could not speak
2562,A JUVENILE STORY.,"any more—her eyes grew burning and wild—her features quivered, and she"
2563,A JUVENILE STORY.,"shook so fearfully that Mary was frightened, and tried to get from her"
2564,A JUVENILE STORY.,arms.
2565,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2566,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Namoina,’ said the old man, ‘the daughter of Anawon must not be a"
2567,A JUVENILE STORY.,coward.’
2568,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2569,A JUVENILE STORY.,“This appeal had the desired effect—she dashed the few burning tears
2570,A JUVENILE STORY.,"from her eyelids, and bending a moment before her father, she rose up"
2571,A JUVENILE STORY.,"again with a calm brow, that told not of the struggle in her heart; and,"
2572,A JUVENILE STORY.,"taking Mary again in her arms, she kissed her, and said a great many"
2573,A JUVENILE STORY.,tender and affectionate things to her.
2574,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2575,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Shall I never see my mother?’ asked the child, mournfully; ‘has she"
2576,A JUVENILE STORY.,forgotten me?’
2577,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2578,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Forget thee, my flower! Does the mother ever forget the child that has"
2579,A JUVENILE STORY.,fed from her bosom!’ Again she was terribly distressed. After a few
2580,A JUVENILE STORY.,"minutes she held the child up toward heaven and said, ‘The Great Spirit"
2581,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of thy fathers keep thee—and bless thee!’ then setting her down again,"
2582,A JUVENILE STORY.,she resumed her former seat on the rock and began picking up the pebbles
2583,A JUVENILE STORY.,around her and counting them; but no entreaty or endearment could draw a
2584,A JUVENILE STORY.,single word or look from her.
2585,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2586,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Mary saw Anawon partake of some of the food she had brought him, and,"
2587,A JUVENILE STORY.,"leaving the remainder, she took her basket and returned home for the"
2588,A JUVENILE STORY.,first time in her life really unhappy; and for the first time in her
2589,A JUVENILE STORY.,"life she did not open her whole heart to her mother. Mrs. Gray, however,"
2590,A JUVENILE STORY.,"observed that her cheek was flushed, and thought she must have taken"
2591,A JUVENILE STORY.,cold; and when it was about sunset she persuaded her to go to bed. Mary
2592,A JUVENILE STORY.,"was glad to be where no one could notice or disturb her feelings; so,"
2593,A JUVENILE STORY.,"kissing her good mother, she went to her room, and knelt down by her"
2594,A JUVENILE STORY.,little bed and said her evening prayers. Very soon she heard voices; and
2595,A JUVENILE STORY.,then she knew that her father and brother had come; and just as she was
2596,A JUVENILE STORY.,"going to rise from her bed and dress, for the purpose of seeing them,"
2597,A JUVENILE STORY.,"she heard William say that they had got on the track of old Anawon,[8]"
2598,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and that he believed he was not far hence, probably out toward Seekonk;"
2599,A JUVENILE STORY.,and that they had better take whatever nourishment could be had and be
2600,A JUVENILE STORY.,after him directly. Mrs. Gray said nothing of the wounded Indian in the
2601,A JUVENILE STORY.,"woods; and when William said he must go in and give his sister one kiss,"
2602,A JUVENILE STORY.,"she said, ‘Do not go to-night, my son, for the child has a bad cold and"
2603,A JUVENILE STORY.,I am really afraid she will take the fever; and if she knows you are
2604,A JUVENILE STORY.,come she will not sleep another wink to-night for joy.’
2605,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2606,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“At any other time, indeed, Mary would have been overjoyed to see"
2607,A JUVENILE STORY.,"them—but now she was thinking only of the poor Indian, and that he might"
2608,A JUVENILE STORY.,"be killed; and, in her distress, she could not help thinking that men"
2609,A JUVENILE STORY.,were very cruel and very wicked to wish to murder each other. After
2610,A JUVENILE STORY.,"bearing her anxiety of mind as long as she could, she resolved to go"
2611,A JUVENILE STORY.,"herself, if she could steal from the house unperceived, and warn the"
2612,A JUVENILE STORY.,Indian of his danger.
2613,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2614,A JUVENILE STORY.,“‘That was right!’ exclaimed both the boys at once.
2615,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2616,A JUVENILE STORY.,“That was right!” echoed Ann.
2617,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2618,A JUVENILE STORY.,“I wish I could have seen that girl!” said George Gray.
2619,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2620,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“I think we have some good girls among us,” said Henry Jackson, with a"
2621,A JUVENILE STORY.,kind look at his cousin Ann.
2622,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2623,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“True,” said the grandmother, who noticed and applauded that look, “very"
2624,A JUVENILE STORY.,true; though few persons may be so situated as to perform _brilliant_
2625,A JUVENILE STORY.,"actions, yet _all_ may have opportunity to do many _good_ ones. We"
2626,A JUVENILE STORY.,cannot tell what _might be done_ by what _is done_; but we must believe
2627,A JUVENILE STORY.,that a truly generous and virtuous heart will act nobly in _all_
2628,A JUVENILE STORY.,situations.
2629,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2630,A JUVENILE STORY.,“But to return to Mary. She rose and dressed herself very quickly; and
2631,A JUVENILE STORY.,"wrapping a little blanket about her, she fell on her knees a moment, and"
2632,A JUVENILE STORY.,"prayed God to keep her from all harm, and to forgive her for leaving the"
2633,A JUVENILE STORY.,house without her parents’ knowledge; for Mary was a very obedient and
2634,A JUVENILE STORY.,faithful child; and this was the first time she had ever done any
2635,A JUVENILE STORY.,important thing without the consent and approbation of her parents. She
2636,A JUVENILE STORY.,"opened a door which led from her little room into a narrow entry, and"
2637,A JUVENILE STORY.,"passed, without observation, into the open air. The moon was nearly at"
2638,A JUVENILE STORY.,the full. Heavy and rich masses of clouds were continually floating over
2639,A JUVENILE STORY.,"its surface, and, sometimes, almost obscuring its light; but then they"
2640,A JUVENILE STORY.,"would pass away, and the moon would shine out brighter than before; and"
2641,A JUVENILE STORY.,the waters of the river flashed like diamonds; and all the leaves of the
2642,A JUVENILE STORY.,"wilderness, as they waved in the stirring wind, shone as if they had"
2643,A JUVENILE STORY.,been dipped in molten silver. Mary clapped her little hands and forgot
2644,A JUVENILE STORY.,"to be afraid, for her spirit was worshipping that God who maketh night"
2645,A JUVENILE STORY.,so very glorious.
2646,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2647,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“And now let me tell you, my children, a good child never need be afraid"
2648,A JUVENILE STORY.,"in the darkness more than in the open day; for, as the Scriptures say,"
2649,A JUVENILE STORY.,"‘He knoweth all the lambs of his fold;’ and again, ‘A sparrow falleth"
2650,A JUVENILE STORY.,not to the ground without his knowledge.’
2651,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2652,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“The way was familiar to Mary, and soon she came to the rock where she"
2653,A JUVENILE STORY.,"had left Anawon. When her steps were heard, the old chief started to his"
2654,A JUVENILE STORY.,"feet and uttered a low cry, and, directly, several Indians stood by his"
2655,A JUVENILE STORY.,"side. Mary was not afraid, even then; for though the Indians were the"
2656,A JUVENILE STORY.,"enemies of her nation and her kindred, they were not her enemies—they"
2657,A JUVENILE STORY.,"were her friends: for there was hardly one among them who had not, at"
2658,A JUVENILE STORY.,"some time or other, felt the kindness of the sweet child. So she walked"
2659,A JUVENILE STORY.,"directly into the midst, fearless of the tomahawks that were lifted at"
2660,A JUVENILE STORY.,"her approach, and holding up her little hand to Anawon, said, in her"
2661,A JUVENILE STORY.,"low, sweet voice, ‘Father—fly—thy enemy is at hand!’"
2662,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2663,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“The old Indian seemed, at first, almost choked with emotion; for he"
2664,A JUVENILE STORY.,well knew that his enemies were the friends of Mary; and laying his hand
2665,A JUVENILE STORY.,"on the child’s head as she bent before him, he only said, ‘The God of"
2666,A JUVENILE STORY.,the white man and the Great Spirit of the Indian be with thee!’ and his
2667,A JUVENILE STORY.,"followers, who, from the moment she was known, had fallen back from the"
2668,A JUVENILE STORY.,"centre of the rock, as they leaned upon their bows and looked upon the"
2669,A JUVENILE STORY.,"child, repeated, at once, a word in the Indian tongue, which was as much"
2670,A JUVENILE STORY.,"as to say, ‘Amen.’"
2671,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2672,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Then Anawon unbound a wampum bracelet from his arm, and giving it to"
2673,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Mary, said, ‘Daughter! in the hour of sorrow bring this to Anawon; and"
2674,A JUVENILE STORY.,"ask what thou wilt, and it shall not be denied thee!’"
2675,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2676,A JUVENILE STORY.,“Then Namoina (whom we will henceforth call Rachel) took the child in
2677,A JUVENILE STORY.,"her arms and kissed her, and wrapped her little blanket about her; and"
2678,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Mary ran swiftly toward home. She reached her room in safety, and soon"
2679,A JUVENILE STORY.,"she fell asleep, for she was very tired. Soon after this Mrs. Gray came"
2680,A JUVENILE STORY.,"into the room, and saw that Mary was asleep, and that her pillow was wet"
2681,A JUVENILE STORY.,"with tears; she could not think what had caused them, for she had never"
2682,A JUVENILE STORY.,known Mary to be very unhappy. Just at this moment William came in on
2683,A JUVENILE STORY.,"tiptoe; and, as he bent down to kiss his sister’s cheek, he saw the"
2684,A JUVENILE STORY.,"bracelet, which had fallen to the floor, and examining it by the light"
2685,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of the moon, he thought he had seen it before; and taking it to his"
2686,A JUVENILE STORY.,"father, Mr. Gray said that he remembered it very well, for he had seen"
2687,A JUVENILE STORY.,it on the arm of Anawon.
2688,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2689,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘I will wake Mary instantly,’ said William, ‘and perhaps she can tell"
2690,A JUVENILE STORY.,us where he is; and we will have the cunning old savage before morning!’
2691,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2692,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Thou art much too hasty,’ said Mr. Gray, laying a hand on his son’s"
2693,A JUVENILE STORY.,arm; ‘this token was given to thy sister in peace and love. Thou knowest
2694,A JUVENILE STORY.,"boy,’ he continued, with difficulty restraining his son, ‘thou knowest"
2695,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the child’s heart would be broken, if she were obliged, in any way, to"
2696,A JUVENILE STORY.,"be made an instrument of evil. Alas!’ he added, giving way to the"
2697,A JUVENILE STORY.,"natural tenderness of his heart, ‘alas! that we are compelled, by cruel"
2698,A JUVENILE STORY.,"necessity, to slay, ay, murder each other!’ and Simon Gray folded his"
2699,A JUVENILE STORY.,"dark, bony hands upon his breast and was silent."
2700,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2701,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Observing the boy still unsatisfied, he said, ‘Go to thy rest, my son;"
2702,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the Lord in his own good time will do the work. At all events, if I can"
2703,A JUVENILE STORY.,"prevent it, blood shall never fall upon the head of Mary.’"
2704,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2705,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“The next morning by dawn of day, father and son departed. Mary was not"
2706,A JUVENILE STORY.,"awake, for she had been so tired that she slept very soundly; and"
2707,A JUVENILE STORY.,"William was just allowed to kiss her cheek _very_ softly, and deposite"
2708,A JUVENILE STORY.,by her side some little baskets of willow; and he then embraced his
2709,A JUVENILE STORY.,"weeping mother and hastened to join his father, who already stood by"
2710,A JUVENILE STORY.,the gate waiting for him.
2711,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2712,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“When Mary awoke, she was so much disappointed because they were gone,"
2713,A JUVENILE STORY.,that she could hardly keep from crying; but she saw that her mother was
2714,A JUVENILE STORY.,"striving to be cheerful, so she wiped the few tears that fell upon her"
2715,A JUVENILE STORY.,"cheek, and folding her arms round her neck, she whispered softly, ‘Let"
2716,A JUVENILE STORY.,"us pray to God, mother, and he will comfort us.’ And they both knelt"
2717,A JUVENILE STORY.,"down and prayed, and when they rose up they were quite calm; for God"
2718,A JUVENILE STORY.,"never withholds a blessing from those who seek in humility of soul, and"
2719,A JUVENILE STORY.,"never withdraws his countenance from those who trust in him. And now, my"
2720,A JUVENILE STORY.,"children, I beg you to remember, whatever may be your trials and"
2721,A JUVENILE STORY.,"distresses, always to put your trust in God, and nothing will have power"
2722,A JUVENILE STORY.,"to harm you; but do not think, my children, that you must wait till"
2723,A JUVENILE STORY.,distresses _come_—seek the love of God in the day of joy—and in the hour
2724,A JUVENILE STORY.,of sorrow he will not be far off.
2725,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2726,A JUVENILE STORY.,“But to return to my story. Two months had passed away and Mr. Gray and
2727,A JUVENILE STORY.,"William had not returned, though Mrs. Gray had heard from them"
2728,A JUVENILE STORY.,occasionally.
2729,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2730,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“It was a bright afternoon in September, and Mary had taken her"
2731,A JUVENILE STORY.,knitting-work and was sitting beside her mother’s arm-chair at the door
2732,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of their cottage; but she could not work, for her eyes were continually"
2733,A JUVENILE STORY.,"wandering off in the direction of the Seekonk road; and, at every waving"
2734,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of the trees, or the least unusual sound, she would start from her seat,"
2735,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and say, ‘They are coming!’ and then run to make some addition, or"
2736,A JUVENILE STORY.,"alteration, to the furniture of a small round table, white as snow which"
2737,A JUVENILE STORY.,"was spread with bowls and spoons, brown bread and baked apples, and a"
2738,A JUVENILE STORY.,"pan of new milk; and then, returning to the door, she would expect to"
2739,A JUVENILE STORY.,"find them near; but when she looked in every direction, she saw only the"
2740,A JUVENILE STORY.,few quiet looking houses of the Plantation—the wide and almost unbroken
2741,A JUVENILE STORY.,"forest, and the broad road before her—but no father or brother. She had"
2742,A JUVENILE STORY.,"repeated this act several times, and at each successive one she was more"
2743,A JUVENILE STORY.,"sure that they were coming; until, at last, the continued disappointment"
2744,A JUVENILE STORY.,"was more than she could bear; and, clinging round her mother’s neck, she"
2745,A JUVENILE STORY.,burst into tears.
2746,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2747,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Mr. Gray and William had sent word, by some men belonging to the town,"
2748,A JUVENILE STORY.,"that they should be at home the night before, and they had not come."
2749,A JUVENILE STORY.,Might not some terrible accident have happened?
2750,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2751,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Mrs. Gray had been sitting silently, with her arms folded upon her"
2752,A JUVENILE STORY.,"breast, struggling within herself to bear the approaching trial as"
2753,A JUVENILE STORY.,became a Christian; for she knew better than Mary did how full of
2754,A JUVENILE STORY.,"disappointment life is, and she knew also that the times were peculiarly"
2755,A JUVENILE STORY.,"uncertain and hazardous. She had appeared calm, notwithstanding, for she"
2756,A JUVENILE STORY.,did not wish to check the fond anticipations of Mary; but when she saw
2757,A JUVENILE STORY.,that even she could not hope any longer—when she felt the sweet child
2758,A JUVENILE STORY.,"weeping upon her breast, for an instant her calmness forsook her, and"
2759,A JUVENILE STORY.,she wept with Mary.
2760,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2761,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Do _you_ believe, mother, they will not come?’ sobbed the child; ‘do"
2762,A JUVENILE STORY.,_you_ believe they will not come to-night?’ And shaking away the curls
2763,A JUVENILE STORY.,"from her face, and a flood of tears with them, she looked upon her"
2764,A JUVENILE STORY.,mother as if she would read her thoughts before she spoke.
2765,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2766,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘They will come, my child,’ said Mrs. Gray, speaking with much"
2767,A JUVENILE STORY.,difficulty; ‘they will come when it is God’s pleasure;’ and putting the
2768,A JUVENILE STORY.,"child from her arms, she went to her room and shut herself in, for her"
2769,A JUVENILE STORY.,distress was so great that she could not bear to have Mary see it.
2770,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2771,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“The child, being left to herself, wept without restraint; but still she"
2772,A JUVENILE STORY.,did not actually believe that her father and brother would not come very
2773,A JUVENILE STORY.,"soon, and she dried her tears and thought she would run out a little way"
2774,A JUVENILE STORY.,"on the Seekonk road, and perhaps she might meet them. When she had got a"
2775,A JUVENILE STORY.,"little way from the house she saw a person approaching, and she hastened"
2776,A JUVENILE STORY.,"along, hoping to hear something of her father and brother; and when she"
2777,A JUVENILE STORY.,"got near she saw it was Rachel. Mary was very glad, for she had not seen"
2778,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Rachel for a long time, and she knew the Indian woman was a good friend"
2779,A JUVENILE STORY.,"to her, so she ran toward her and put her little arms around her; but"
2780,A JUVENILE STORY.,her heart was so full she could not speak. Rachel did not know her at
2781,A JUVENILE STORY.,"first; but when she saw that it was Mary, she held her in her arms,"
2782,A JUVENILE STORY.,"repeating, all the while, some words in the Indian tongue, which Mary"
2783,A JUVENILE STORY.,knew were a kind of thanksgiving to the Great Spirit.
2784,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2785,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Child, I was seeking thee!’ she said, at last, in imperfect English;"
2786,A JUVENILE STORY.,‘I have bad news—thy brother is fallen among his enemies!’
2787,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2788,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Will not my brother come home?’ said the child, bursting into tears;"

2793,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2794,A JUVENILE STORY.,“‘Where is he? Let me go to him!’ said the child.
2795,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2796,A JUVENILE STORY.,“‘It was for that very purpose I came to thee. For thy sake he may yet
2797,A JUVENILE STORY.,live—he is in the hands of Anawon.’
2798,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2799,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘O, let us go this instant! Let us run! Let us fly!’ said Mary, seizing"
2800,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the hand of Rachel; and she ran forward a few steps—then, stopping"
2801,A JUVENILE STORY.,"short, she said, ‘I must run back and tell mother; I cannot go without"
2802,A JUVENILE STORY.,telling her!’
2803,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2804,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Thou must not go back,’ said Rachel; ‘let her not know his danger till"

2813,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2814,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘O let us go then!’ said the child, with a piercing cry, ‘let us hurry!"
2815,A JUVENILE STORY.,let us go!’
2816,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2817,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘The pledge of Anawon, is it about thee, child?’ asked Rachel; and Mary"
2818,A JUVENILE STORY.,drew from her pocket the bracelet of the chief; and they went on.
2819,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2820,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Their way lay directly through the woods. Mary’s poor, little, bare"
2821,A JUVENILE STORY.,"feet, were dreadfully scratched with the briers; and she was so tired"
2822,A JUVENILE STORY.,"with running, and hurrying, and crying, that sometimes Rachel was"
2823,A JUVENILE STORY.,"obliged to take her up and carry her. At length it grew very dark; and,"
2824,A JUVENILE STORY.,"at first, Mary could hardly tell where to step; but when she got used to"
2825,A JUVENILE STORY.,"it she did not mind it at all—for she was not thinking of herself, but"
2826,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of her father, and mother, and brother."
2827,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2828,A JUVENILE STORY.,“After they had gone several miles they saw a light at a great distance:
2829,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and, when they came near, they saw it was a large fire—and when they got"
2830,A JUVENILE STORY.,"still nearer, they saw a great many Indians, with painted faces and"
2831,A JUVENILE STORY.,"tomahawks in their hands, dancing about it, singing, and shouting, and"
2832,A JUVENILE STORY.,uttering terrible cries.
2833,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2834,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“One of the Indians, who was stationed to keep watch, saw little Mary"
2835,A JUVENILE STORY.,and her guide; and as soon as he knew Rachel he shouted ‘Namoina!’ And
2836,A JUVENILE STORY.,"all immediately rested their tomahawks on the ground, and, ceasing to"
2837,A JUVENILE STORY.,"sing and dance, they awaited her approach with all the respect due to"
2838,A JUVENILE STORY.,the daughter of so mighty a chief as Anawon.
2839,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2840,A JUVENILE STORY.,“Mary Wallace saw but one thing. As the ring opened she beheld her
2841,A JUVENILE STORY.,"brother standing in the midst, beside a large pile of light fuel, which"
2842,A JUVENILE STORY.,was all ready to be kindled; his hands were bound behind him and his
2843,A JUVENILE STORY.,"head was bent down. Mary gave one spring, and, fearing not the terrible"
2844,A JUVENILE STORY.,"looking men around her, she bounded to the side of William; and clinging"
2845,A JUVENILE STORY.,"round his neck, she sobbed as if her little heart was breaking. William"
2846,A JUVENILE STORY.,was pale as death when he saw Mary. A few hot tears fell on his cheek;
2847,A JUVENILE STORY.,but he spoke not; he bowed his head upon her neck awhile—and then his
2848,A JUVENILE STORY.,"heart was melted—and he sobbed aloud. This relieved him, and he"
2849,A JUVENILE STORY.,"whispered, ‘Sister, wipe my tears away and leave me—thou must not see me"
2850,A JUVENILE STORY.,die.’
2851,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2852,A JUVENILE STORY.,"‘Thou wilt not die! Thou shalt not!’ said Mary, wringing her hands; and,"
2853,A JUVENILE STORY.,"losing all fear, but that of her brother’s death, she ran wildly from"
2854,A JUVENILE STORY.,"one to another crying out, ‘Will my brother die? must William die?’"
2855,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2856,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Anawon, who sat apart on a rock higher than those around, saw and heard"
2857,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the tumult; but he knew not its cause; and, in a deep and somewhat angry"
2858,A JUVENILE STORY.,"tone of voice, he gave orders for the noise to be hushed, and the awful"
2859,A JUVENILE STORY.,ceremonies of death to be resumed. In an instant the place was still—and
2860,A JUVENILE STORY.,"then a low murmur ran among the crowd, ‘The Child of Sunrise!’—‘The Bird"
2861,A JUVENILE STORY.,of Peace!’—‘The Red Man’s Friend!’ and such was the strong love Mary had
2862,A JUVENILE STORY.,"excited among the Indians, that, for a moment, not a hand was lifted,"
2863,A JUVENILE STORY.,even at the command of their chief—then slowly they prepared to obey.
2864,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2865,A JUVENILE STORY.,“As Mary’s almost distracted features were turned to the glaring light
2866,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of the death-fire, Anawon saw her; and the long, deep, agonizing groan"
2867,A JUVENILE STORY.,"he did not try to suppress, told that she was recognized. The next"
2868,A JUVENILE STORY.,moment she was at his feet. The bracelet was clasped about his arm.
2869,A JUVENILE STORY.,"‘Father, will he die!’ was all that she could speak; and poor little"
2870,A JUVENILE STORY.,Mary fainted away.
2871,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2872,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Anawon took the child in his own arms, and administered something which"
2873,A JUVENILE STORY.,"revived her; and when he saw her beautiful blue eyes again, he wiped the"
2874,A JUVENILE STORY.,"heavy drops of sweat from his brow, and gave orders for the release of"
2875,A JUVENILE STORY.,the prisoner. Mary was then almost wild with joy—and she laughed and
2876,A JUVENILE STORY.,wept—and sang and danced—and ran from one to another—and they feared she
2877,A JUVENILE STORY.,would go into fits; but in a few minutes she was completely exhausted;
2878,A JUVENILE STORY.,and Rachel took her in her arms and held her.
2879,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2880,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“William wanted to go home immediately, because he knew his parents"
2881,A JUVENILE STORY.,would be very much distressed about their children. One of the Indians
2882,A JUVENILE STORY.,"said he would carry little Mary in his arms, and, accompanied by Rachel,"
2883,A JUVENILE STORY.,they set out.
2884,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2885,A JUVENILE STORY.,“It was about sunrise when they came in sight of Providence; and just
2886,A JUVENILE STORY.,"then they met Simon Gray, at the head of a small band of men, going out"
2887,A JUVENILE STORY.,in pursuit of his children. He was very much overcome at meeting them so
2888,A JUVENILE STORY.,unexpectedly; and he forgot not to fall on his knees and bless God for
2889,A JUVENILE STORY.,"their restoration. Then he embraced them affectionately, and learned the"
2890,A JUVENILE STORY.,particulars of their escape.
2891,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2892,A JUVENILE STORY.,“During this time the men ran on before to the settlement and told the
2893,A JUVENILE STORY.,news; and as they entered the town the people came running out of their
2894,A JUVENILE STORY.,"houses, all uttering expressions of joy, and blessing God for their"
2895,A JUVENILE STORY.,happy deliverance. But the mother’s heart was most severely tried. She
2896,A JUVENILE STORY.,"had given them up, and had become almost calm; but when the news of"
2897,A JUVENILE STORY.,"their safe return reached her, her agitation was so great that she fell"
2898,A JUVENILE STORY.,"into fits; and from their effect she never recovered. She lingered,"
2899,A JUVENILE STORY.,"however, in a weak state nearly a year; and then she took an epidemic"
2900,A JUVENILE STORY.,fever and died; and Mary Wallace was once more—an orphan!
2901,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2902,A JUVENILE STORY.,“During this time the poor Indians were mostly subdued. King Philip was
2903,A JUVENILE STORY.,"killed; Anawon was taken by Captain Church, and, during the absence of"
2904,A JUVENILE STORY.,"that good man, was shamefully put to death. Mary was much distressed,"
2905,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and refused to be comforted, when she heard of the cruel death of her"
2906,A JUVENILE STORY.,"good old friend, (though William often told her that the white people"
2907,A JUVENILE STORY.,"never could be safe while he lived,) and when she was alone she would"
2908,A JUVENILE STORY.,weep at thinking of it.
2909,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2910,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“One day, a short time after her mother’s death, she went to visit a"
2911,A JUVENILE STORY.,friend about five or six miles from the Plantation; and in the afternoon
2912,A JUVENILE STORY.,"she walked out alone, thinking she would go and see the rock where"
2913,A JUVENILE STORY.,Philip and his men had once concealed themselves. She soon found the
2914,A JUVENILE STORY.,"place; for the main rock, which the Indians called Quinsniket, or"
2915,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Rock-house, was larger than, and different from, all others around. This"
2916,A JUVENILE STORY.,"rock projects over to the southwest, and under that side of it the"
2917,A JUVENILE STORY.,"Indians had found a home. Mary went there and examined the place, and"
2918,A JUVENILE STORY.,"she found a great many arrow-spikes made of flint, and some pieces of"
2919,A JUVENILE STORY.,wampum; and the ashes of their fires were still visible. She then
2920,A JUVENILE STORY.,"climbed to the top of the rock, and sat down under the shade of a tall"
2921,A JUVENILE STORY.,sugar-maple; and there she could not help thinking how cruel it was for
2922,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the poor Indians to be killed or driven from their lands, and their"
2923,A JUVENILE STORY.,"houses, and their fathers’ graves."
2924,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2925,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“As she was returning, a little way from Quinsniket, she saw a woman"
2926,A JUVENILE STORY.,"sitting on a flat stone, in the midst of a square where the earth seemed"
2927,A JUVENILE STORY.,"to have been blackened with fire, and where the grass had never since"
2928,A JUVENILE STORY.,"grown. When Mary came nearer, she saw that it was Rachel. Overjoyed, she"
2929,A JUVENILE STORY.,"was just going to spring to her arms, for she had not seen her friend"
2930,A JUVENILE STORY.,"since the morning of her brother’s release, when she saw the poor"
2931,A JUVENILE STORY.,"creature was weeping. As soon as Rachel saw Mary, she hid her head in"
2932,A JUVENILE STORY.,"her blanket. The child looked at her a moment sorrowfully, then"
2933,A JUVENILE STORY.,"springing to her lap she folded her little arms round her neck, and"
2934,A JUVENILE STORY.,"putting her soft cheek close to hers, wept with her. This act of"
2935,A JUVENILE STORY.,tenderness softened Rachel; and wiping away her own tears with a corner
2936,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of her blanket, she held up the child and gazed mournfully upon her"
2937,A JUVENILE STORY.,"face; then she said, ‘Weep on, my daughter! weep on!—for thy tears are"
2938,A JUVENILE STORY.,cool and pleasant; but mine—O! they are drops of fire!’ Then she spoke
2939,A JUVENILE STORY.,"of her father’s death and the downfall of her race, till her voice was"
2940,A JUVENILE STORY.,"choked—and she wept like a heart-broken child. Again she was silent, and"
2941,A JUVENILE STORY.,"began to pluck the blades of grass and weave them into basket-work,"
2942,A JUVENILE STORY.,keeping her face all the while turned from Mary.
2943,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2944,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Suddenly she looked upon the child, and exclaimed, with much energy,"
2945,A JUVENILE STORY.,‘Here—here! on this very spot ’twas done!’
2946,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2947,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘What, mother? what was done’? asked Mary, with a trembling voice."
2948,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2949,A JUVENILE STORY.,“‘My babe—my babe!’ Rachel could say no more for an instant; and then
2950,A JUVENILE STORY.,"she added, ‘I will tell thee: Namoina was the daughter of a mighty"
2951,A JUVENILE STORY.,"chief; many chiefs sought her in marriage—but she said, “No!” for her"
2952,A JUVENILE STORY.,"heart beat quick only at the step of Mohaton the brave. Anawon, the"
2953,A JUVENILE STORY.,"great chief, said, “Go!” and Namoina took the hand of Mohaton, and went"
2954,A JUVENILE STORY.,from her father. We had one babe—it was beautiful and dear—and it went
2955,A JUVENILE STORY.,as quick from my arms as the blossom from the corn-leaf. The white man
2956,A JUVENILE STORY.,came—Mohaton fell by our own door! and my babe—they trod upon it! It saw
2957,A JUVENILE STORY.,me—it tried to lift its little arms—it tried to open its little eyes—it
2958,A JUVENILE STORY.,could not. I took it in my arms—it was cold—still—dead. I saw not that
2959,A JUVENILE STORY.,all my brethren had gone—I saw not that I was alone. I held my little
2960,A JUVENILE STORY.,one till night came and made everything as dark and cold as my own
2961,A JUVENILE STORY.,"bosom, and then I laid it in the ground—here!’ As she spoke she"
2962,A JUVENILE STORY.,"stretched out her hand, and rested it an instant on a little mound"
2963,A JUVENILE STORY.,"beside her; then she stretched out her arms and fell upon it, and wept"
2964,A JUVENILE STORY.,and groaned fearfully.
2965,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2966,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“After a short time she arose, and dashing the tears away from her"
2967,A JUVENILE STORY.,"cheek, she became terribly calm, and continued: [9]‘At last the hope of"
2968,A JUVENILE STORY.,vengeance possessed me. I rose from this grave and vowed to kill the
2969,A JUVENILE STORY.,"first white child I could find. I found thee, my child—I brought thee"
2970,A JUVENILE STORY.,here—to the very spot where my own darling bled; but thy smile was so
2971,A JUVENILE STORY.,sweet—thy voice was so soft and pitiful—thy little arms clung around my
2972,A JUVENILE STORY.,"neck so tenderly, I could not kill thee; and the spirit of my little one"
2973,A JUVENILE STORY.,"whispered to me constantly, “Let Mary lie in thy bosom and warm it"
2974,A JUVENILE STORY.,"again!” So I kept thee, and when three moons[10] were gone, it was cold,"
2975,A JUVENILE STORY.,"and thy little limbs trembled, and thy cheek was blue. I saw that the"
2976,A JUVENILE STORY.,child of the Pale-face should not dwell in the wilderness. I gave thee
2977,A JUVENILE STORY.,meal and corn; but the food of the red babe was not for thee. I was
2978,A JUVENILE STORY.,afraid that thou too wouldst die. I sought thy mother to give thee up.
2979,A JUVENILE STORY.,"She had gone, with her broken heart, over the great waters.[11] Namoina"
2980,A JUVENILE STORY.,knew how to pity her. Thy father was slain in battle. She was a
2981,A JUVENILE STORY.,motherless widow. On my way back Simon Gray found me; and when I saw
2982,A JUVENILE STORY.,"thee among thy own people, I could not take thee away. Thy smile was as"
2983,A JUVENILE STORY.,"the sunlight to me—thou wert the only thing that made life pleasant, and"
2984,A JUVENILE STORY.,"yet I left thee.’ She paused, and Mary hid her face in the faithful"
2985,A JUVENILE STORY.,creature’s bosom and wept without restraint.
2986,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2987,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Again she resumed—‘The mother I found thee is gone, and now I will give"
2988,A JUVENILE STORY.,thee back the other—thy own!’
2989,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2990,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Where? where?’ asked Mary, lifting her hands quickly. ‘Where is my"
2991,A JUVENILE STORY.,mother?’
2992,A JUVENILE STORY.,
2993,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Be patient, and I will tell thee. Go to Seekonk on the next day thy"
2994,A JUVENILE STORY.,people meet to worship the Great Spirit—I have promised to send thee—she
2995,A JUVENILE STORY.,"will be there; a tall woman, and slender and graceful as a reed upon the"
2996,A JUVENILE STORY.,"hill-side. Her brow is fair as the coming of light, fair as thy own, my"
2997,A JUVENILE STORY.,child: and her dark hair falleth over it as the shadows of evening upon
2998,A JUVENILE STORY.,"snow. There she is,’ continued Rachel, taking a small miniature from her"
2999,A JUVENILE STORY.,"own neck, and giving it to Mary, ‘some some cunning[12] man of thy"
3000,A JUVENILE STORY.,"people hath put her face here; but not all. The kind look, and the"

3002,A JUVENILE STORY.,
3003,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“Mary took the picture and looked upon it, and kissed it, and thanked"

3009,A JUVENILE STORY.,"thy sweet voice, and by thy father’s soft blue eye.’ As she spoke she"
3010,A JUVENILE STORY.,"gave some little toys to Mary, and then, motioning her away, she added,"
3011,A JUVENILE STORY.,"in a thick and tremulous voice, ‘now go, and let Namoina—die!’"
3012,A JUVENILE STORY.,
3013,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Die!’ repeated Mary, ‘Die! what can my mother mean?’"

3019,A JUVENILE STORY.,

3023,A JUVENILE STORY.,"“‘Go, but come not again! go, and return not! Namoina will find it hard"

3084,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"dark; and there her friends, who, alarmed at her absence, went in search"
3085,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"of her, found her."
3086,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3087,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“They removed the body to the house, and Mary watched by it through the"
3088,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,night; and the next day poor Namoina was decently buried. Her funeral
3089,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"was respectably attended, and Mary mourned for her."
3090,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3091,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“But the child was now awakened to new hopes; she could think of nothing
3092,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"but her mother. She was longing to see her, and yet she was almost"
3093,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,afraid; for she had loved her adopted mother so dearly she thought she
3094,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"could not, perhaps, like her own mother as well; and the thought was"
3095,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"distressing to her. But, between the different agitations of hope and"
3096,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"fear, the two days that remained between the burial of her Indian friend"
3097,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"and the Sabbath, seemed to her the longest days she had ever known. She"
3098,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,had begged her father’s permission for William to take her to Seekonk on
3099,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"the next Sabbath, and he had willingly granted her request; but she said"
3100,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"nothing of her hopes to her father or brother, from a delicate regard"
3101,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"for their feelings, because, at the best, she knew it would distress"
3102,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,them. They and the dear departed one who had nursed and loved her from
3103,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"infancy, had been so long all-in-all to her, that her heart was"
3104,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"reluctant, even in secrecy, to cherish a hope independent of them. Then"
3105,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,poor Mary was perplexed by a thousand fears; she thought that it might
3106,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,rain—or that her mother might be sick—or that there might be some
3107,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"misunderstanding—or that, perhaps, the whole was but a raving fancy of"
3108,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"Namoina—or if the whole was true, (and this Mary firmly believed when"
3109,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"she looked in love upon the sweet features that never left her bosom,"
3110,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"but to be kissed and wept upon,) a thousand unthought of difficulties"
3111,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"might occur. In short, her fears, and doubts, and anxieties, were"
3112,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"innumerable. She could neither take food or rest, nor attend steadily to"
3113,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"her daily occupations; and she kept by herself as much as possible, and"
3114,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,spent most of her time in prayer.
3115,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3116,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“At last the Sabbath came. It was a beautiful October morning. The sun
3117,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,went up gloriously and melted away the bright frost from the foliage;
3118,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"and the forest—you have seen our woods in the autumn, children, and you"
3119,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,know how beautiful they are when the frost has turned the leaves.”
3120,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3121,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“Yes,” said Ann, “and do you remember the lines upon ‘Autumn,’ you gave"
3122,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"me the other day, where the sweet poet we love so dearly, compares our"
3123,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,autumn foliage to ‘a flood of molten rainbows?’ A beautiful thought—is
3124,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"it not, grandmother?”"
3125,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3126,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“True, my child,” said Mrs. Gray, turning an affectionate glance to the"
3127,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"bright eyes that were lifted up; “but your brother and cousins, I see,"
3128,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"are more interested about the fate of Mary, than the beauties of autumn."
3129,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3130,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“I said it was a lovely morning, and Mary would have thought so too at"
3131,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"any other time; for not even you, my dear Ann, have more poetry in your"
3132,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"heart, than Mary Wallace had. Her taste was not cultivated, it is true;"
3133,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,but the God of nature had dealt bountifully by her. She never looked on
3134,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,the beauties of creation without beholding the Creator; and this spirit
3135,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,is one of the highest and richest sources of poetry.
3136,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3137,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“But, as I said, or was going to say, her mind this morning was full of"
3138,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,other thoughts; and she could hardly have told even what season of the
3139,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"year it was, though she loved the autumn dearly, and its beauties were"
3140,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,never before unmarked.
3141,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3142,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“She counted the toys Namoina had given her over and over again, that"
3143,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,she might be sure they were all there; and then she put them into a
3144,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,little bag with a medal she had worn in infancy; and before William had
3145,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"begun to dress, or the horse was brought to the door, she was quite"
3146,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,ready and waiting for him in the passage. She thought William had never
3147,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"been so long in dressing before; and she kept calling to him, and"
3148,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"hurrying him. Her father, wondering at her unusual impatience, stepped"
3149,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,into the passage with a thought to chide her; but she stood there—such a
3150,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"beautiful, bright creature, that he could not; and he paused and looked"
3151,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,upon her in silence. The excitement of her hopes had risen from her
3152,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,heart to her face; the maple leaf was not richer than the bloom upon her
3153,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"cheek, or the sunlight brighter than the flashing of her eye. A short"
3154,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"green mantle hung from her shoulders, and her light, straw grassy bonnet"
3155,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,could not hide the luxury of her brown hair.
3156,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3157,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“As she lifted her head at the sound of foot steps, the golden curls"
3158,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"swept back from her face, and as she looked upon her father her eye"
3159,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,filled with tears; and there was something in it that made the heart of
3160,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"Simon Gray tremble. Mary sprang to his arms and clinging round his neck,"
3161,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,wept; for she thought it was almost wrong to seek another parent when
3162,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,she already had one who loved her so very tenderly. But at the sound of
3163,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"William’s footsteps on the stairs, she kissed her father, and, wiping"
3164,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"away her tears, was all bloom and hope again; and William could not help"
3165,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"pausing to look at her, ere he bounded to the saddle; and he thought she"
3166,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,had never been so beautiful before. But Mary trembled so she could not
3167,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,spring up behind him as usual; her father was obliged to lift her; and
3168,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"when he felt how she trembled, he feared she was ill, and asked her to"
3169,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,stay at home and not go to the meeting; but Mary assured him she was
3170,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"perfectly well; so the kind-hearted man could make no other objection,"
3171,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,and they rode off.
3172,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3173,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“They arrived at the meeting-house before any others; and as the people
3174,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"began to gather to the house, Mary trembled so she could hardly keep her"
3175,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,seat.
3176,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3177,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“One after another came in—one after another was examined; but poor Mary
3178,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,could not think any one of them was her mother. At last a lady came and
3179,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,sat nearly opposite Mary. The child’s heart bounded; she saw the same
3180,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"dark hair and eye—the same white brow—but, O! it had no scar!—and tears"
3181,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,of disappointment filled her eyes. Another came; she was tall and
3182,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"graceful; she had dark hair and eyes, and a very fair brow. ‘That is the"
3183,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"one! That is my mother!’ thought Mary, and she was just going to throw"
3184,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"herself into her arms and call her mother, when the lady—who probably"
3185,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,thought Mary very rude for staring at her so fixedly—turned quickly away
3186,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"with such an angry expression of countenance, that the child could"
3187,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,hardly restrain her tears; and then the idea that the lady might be her
3188,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"mother, made her tremble. Others came, and were, in turn, examined; but"
3189,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,not one of them could be compared with the picture she held in her
3190,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,hand—the description given by Namoina—or the image in the heart of Mary.
3191,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"The poor child was doomed to be disappointed; and she sat down, and"
3192,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"leaned her head upon her hands, and thought she would never hope again."
3193,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3194,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“A low murmur, as of one in prayer, reached her ear. She lifted her"
3195,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"eyes, almost unwillingly, and on the opposite side of the room, she saw"
3196,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"a lady in deep mourning, kneeling before one of the rough benches, in"
3197,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"prayer. The garb of outward grief was an unwonted sight there, and every"
3198,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,eye was turned upon her. Yet there was a kindly expression in every
3199,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"face, for the people, although their own simple creed and rigid habits"
3200,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"forbade the use of a peculiar garment as a sign of wo, could not help"
3201,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,respecting the piety of the stranger. Mary’s heart beat wildly at the
3202,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"first glance, and she turned very pale, and then again her face was"
3203,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"flushed with the fever of excited feelings. After kneeling a short time,"
3204,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"the stranger slowly rose, and turned round upon the little assembly with"
3205,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"a melancholy, listless air. As she did so her face turned full in Mary’s"
3206,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"view; it was pale, and tender, and sorrowful. The child became, at once,"
3207,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,convinced that her search was ended; in that one glance she had seen
3208,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"all; the tall and graceful form—the dark glossy hair—the fair, pale"
3209,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,brow—the scar—the resemblance to the picture—all that she sought was
3210,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,there. She forgot every thing but that she had found her long-lost
3211,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"parent; she flew along the narrow aisle, and when she reached the lady"
3212,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"just whispered, ‘Mother!’ and fell into her arms. The child had fainted."
3213,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3214,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“The strange lady seemed as much overcome as Mary. She held her closely
3215,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"embraced in her arms, and gazed eagerly upon her pallid features. It"
3216,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"chanced at this moment that the miniature fell from Mary’s bosom, and"
3217,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,the medal on which was engraved her name. The stranger looked upon them
3218,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,and uttered a faint scream; then she clasped the child close to her
3219,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"heart; and when Mary opened her blue eyes and smiled upon her, she cried"
3220,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"out, ‘I know thee now, my daughter!—my own beloved daughter!’"
3221,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3222,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“The whole congregation had gathered round with wondering looks and
3223,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"curious faces; and even the good minister himself, instead of going to"
3224,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"his desk, mingled with the crowd, and seemed to enter into the spirit of"
3225,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,the scene.
3226,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3227,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“There was one powerfully interested; William had followed Mary from her
3228,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"seat, wondering at her strange behavior; but from the moment when he saw"
3229,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"that she had found her own mother, he stood with his arms folded upon"
3230,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"his breast, the only silent one among the crowd."
3231,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3232,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“Simon Gray was immediately sent for, and it was established, beyond the"
3233,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"possibility of doubt, that Mary had indeed found a mother, and Mrs."
3234,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,Wallace a long-lost daughter; and the minister offered up a solemn
3235,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,public thanksgiving to God for their re-union.”
3236,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3237,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,The children thanked their grandmother for telling them such a very
3238,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"interesting story, and little Helen danced with joy, she was so glad"
3239,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,that Mary had found her mother.
3240,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3241,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“I have one more wish to be gratified, grandmother,” said George Gray;"
3242,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,“I should like to go to Quinsniket and see the place where Philip and
3243,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"his followers were sheltered, and where Namoina died.”"
3244,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,
3245,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"“Your wish shall be indulged, my dear boy,” said Mrs. Gray. “When the"
3246,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"spring opens, I will take you all to pass a few weeks in the country,"
3247,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,and we will go to Quinsniket. You will find many traces of the Indians
3248,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"still existing, in the names of different localities, and in the"
3249,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,recollections of the ancient inhabitants. The field where they planted
3250,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"their corn, still called Indian oldfield, is to be seen a short distance"
3251,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"from Quinsniket; and the rock itself, so intimately connected with the"
3252,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"history of a fallen but once mighty race, still remains, as it were, a"
3253,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,monument to designate their grave. The spot where poor Namoina was
3254,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"buried, is now within the limits of a little town. Her hut was afterward"
3255,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"rebuilt by a few wandering remnants of her tribe, and some of the"
3256,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,present inhabitants remember it. The hearth-stone is still to be seen;
3257,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"and over it waves a honey-locust tree, which a distinguished gentleman,"
3258,THE DEATH-SONG OF NAMOINA.,"since dead, planted to mark the spot where stood THE LAST WIGWAM.”"

3334,LADY MORGAN.,There bright ambition o’er him broke
3335,LADY MORGAN.,"In strains of martial story,"
3336,LADY MORGAN.,And first his ardent soul awoke

3339,LADY MORGAN.,"’Twas there immortal love,"
3340,LADY MORGAN.,"His golden sunbeams flung around him,"

3342,LADY MORGAN.,With yet one firmer look entwined
3343,LADY MORGAN.,"To all, that must be now resigned."
3344,LADY MORGAN.,
3345,LADY MORGAN.,The stranger watched a dark cloud hovering
3346,LADY MORGAN.,"In the blue sky,"
3347,LADY MORGAN.,"And over Genoa’s walls it was lowering,"
3348,LADY MORGAN.,Nor passed it by.

3353,LADY MORGAN.,To sully the untainted light
3354,LADY MORGAN.,That hallows an Italian night.
3355,LADY MORGAN.,
3356,LADY MORGAN.,His brow was motionless—and none could tell

3358,LADY MORGAN.,And from his still-fixed eye no tear-drop fell

3367,LADY MORGAN.,"To sit the ocean rocks among,"
3368,LADY MORGAN.,Re-echoing the owlets’ song.

3372,LADY MORGAN.,His sires might leave them to be breasting

3406,LADY MORGAN.,"Who know but to _love her, and have her, or die_!"

3415,LADY MORGAN.,What would he more? Let others reap the gain
3416,LADY MORGAN.,That springs from genius’s creative brain—
3417,LADY MORGAN.,’Tis ever so:—while grief and toil must win
3418,LADY MORGAN.,The portals that to glory’s shrine let in.
3419,LADY MORGAN.,But there are toils that win no high renown;
3420,LADY MORGAN.,Griefs that the loftiest spirit can bow down:
3421,LADY MORGAN.,"And such were his, who, standing by that prow,"
3422,LADY MORGAN.,Felt the worst ills that fate on man can throw;
3423,LADY MORGAN.,"But felt them as a man, resolved to bear,"
3424,LADY MORGAN.,And snatch a brand to show what yet he dare

3438,LADY MORGAN.,"Among the envious billows’ angry play,"

3440,LADY MORGAN.,Not that the glories of the sea or sky
3441,LADY MORGAN.,"Absorb the thoughts that in his bosom lie,"
3442,LADY MORGAN.,Panting to burst from their sepulchral home
3443,LADY MORGAN.,In all the ghastliness of livid gloom.
3444,LADY MORGAN.,Why is his head uncovered to the air?
3445,LADY MORGAN.,As if the keenest wind came hotly there.
3446,LADY MORGAN.,"Aye, even with the elemental wrath,"
3447,LADY MORGAN.,His troubled spirit a communion hath.
3448,LADY MORGAN.,"Then stalk before his view in mournful maze,"
3449,LADY MORGAN.,Unburied phantoms of departed days;
3450,LADY MORGAN.,"With withered hopes around them wildly flung,"
3451,LADY MORGAN.,Like flowers to which no breath of odor clung;
3452,LADY MORGAN.,Nor hue of brightness—such as o’er the dead
3453,LADY MORGAN.,The gifts of fond affection vainly shed
3454,LADY MORGAN.,"Become, ere the same morn that saw them bloom, hath fled."
3455,LADY MORGAN.,
3456,LADY MORGAN.,"So on him comes the memory of the past,"
3457,LADY MORGAN.,"In floating shadows thickly seen and fast,"
3458,LADY MORGAN.,Their spectral forms in grim array
3459,LADY MORGAN.,Press on him as in battle-fray.
3460,LADY MORGAN.,"And he resists them not with hostile force,"
3461,LADY MORGAN.,As he would once turn back the assailants’ course
3462,LADY MORGAN.,In the hot tide of war—but vainly throws
3463,LADY MORGAN.,A weak retaliation on those foes
3464,LADY MORGAN.,Who urge a contest with the soul—and there
3465,LADY MORGAN.,Strike their keen shafts envenomed by despair.
3466,LADY MORGAN.,Now in a milder mood his light guitar

3622,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3623,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“Welcome to Wheatland!” cried I, one fine autumnal evening, seeing my"
3624,CONDY O’NEAL.,"old friend, Captain Evans, approaching my door. “You are a bad paymaster"
3625,CONDY O’NEAL.,"in the article of visits,” I continued, handing him an arm-chair. “Here"
3626,CONDY O’NEAL.,"have I been living fifteen years, visiting you half a dozen times a"
3627,CONDY O’NEAL.,"year, and receiving nothing but fruitless promises of a return for my"
3628,CONDY O’NEAL.,"civilities: but here you are at last, and right welcome to your ancient"
3629,CONDY O’NEAL.,hall.”
3630,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3631,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“Aye, aye,” replied the Captain. “Every year, and every month, since"
3632,CONDY O’NEAL.,"leaving this, have I determined that you should have me for your guest;"
3633,CONDY O’NEAL.,"but, I know not how it happened, that each day seemed to bring forth a"
3634,CONDY O’NEAL.,"trouble, or an occupation, at least, sufficient for itself. But here I"
3635,CONDY O’NEAL.,"am at last; and, as Tom is at length out of the way, I mean to be at my"
3636,CONDY O’NEAL.,"ease here, and billet myself upon you for a month at the least.”"
3637,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3638,CONDY O’NEAL.,"Captain Evans was a hardy old “revolutioner,” nearly seventy years of"
3639,CONDY O’NEAL.,"age, but hale and stout, and as active as most men of forty. The farm on"
3640,CONDY O’NEAL.,"which I resided had been the property of his father, and the Captain had"
3641,CONDY O’NEAL.,passed the greater portion of his life upon it. Inheriting the farm upon
3642,CONDY O’NEAL.,"the death of his father, the Captain continued to reside on it until the"
3643,CONDY O’NEAL.,time of my purchasing it from him. His only daughter having been left a
3644,CONDY O’NEAL.,"widow, with four sons, as yet young, he, at her request, sold the farm,"
3645,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and went to reside with her in another part of the country, devoting"
3646,CONDY O’NEAL.,himself to the care of his grandchildren and the management of his
3647,CONDY O’NEAL.,"daughter’s estate. Here I had frequently visited him, and received many"
3648,CONDY O’NEAL.,an unfulfilled promise of a return in kind to my visits. He had at
3649,CONDY O’NEAL.,"length taken the opportunity, when the youngest of his grandsons was"
3650,CONDY O’NEAL.,"sent to college, to pay me the long deferred visit."
3651,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3652,CONDY O’NEAL.,"On the morning following his arrival my guest was, according to his"
3653,CONDY O’NEAL.,"wont, astir very early, and before breakfast was announced we had"
3654,CONDY O’NEAL.,rambled over the greater part of the farm; each well-remembered spot
3655,CONDY O’NEAL.,eliciting its anecdote from my communicative friend.
3656,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3657,CONDY O’NEAL.,"In the evening we again walked abroad; and, having followed the windings"
3658,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of the creek to its junction with the Schuylkill, we seated ourselves"
3659,CONDY O’NEAL.,"upon the mouldering trunk of a gigantic, fallen button-wood tree. The"
3660,CONDY O’NEAL.,"bank of the stream was here about twenty feet in height, and descended"
3661,CONDY O’NEAL.,"perpendicularly to the water, which was very deep. Toward the opposite"
3662,CONDY O’NEAL.,"side the water shoaled, and was bordered by a low, muddy shore."
3663,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3664,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“This,” said I, after a short pause in the conversation, “has been a"
3665,CONDY O’NEAL.,magnificent tree.”
3666,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3667,CONDY O’NEAL.,"The Captain laughed, and said, rather suddenly, “Do you remember Condy"
3668,CONDY O’NEAL.,"O’Neal, a little Irishman, who formerly lived in this neighborhood?”"
3669,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3670,CONDY O’NEAL.,“I have but a faint recollection of the man; he has been dead many a
3671,CONDY O’NEAL.,year since.”
3672,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3673,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“This tree has recalled to my mind a droll adventure of Condy’s, in"
3674,CONDY O’NEAL.,which the tree bore a part.
3675,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3676,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“Condy came into the county about the year 1770, and opened a school. He"
3677,CONDY O’NEAL.,"was a true son of Erin, fond of fun, the bottle, and the girls, and"
3678,CONDY O’NEAL.,"seemed to have been, by nature, designed for amusement. He was a short,"
3679,CONDY O’NEAL.,"fat, little mortal, with a bald patch on his carroty poll; his face was"
3680,CONDY O’NEAL.,"flat and nearly square, his mouth was large, and puckered with a smile"
3681,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of habitual drollery, and his little gray eyes twinkled like those of a"
3682,CONDY O’NEAL.,cat. No one had ever seen Condy looking sad; and he never spoke but to
3683,CONDY O’NEAL.,excite a smile by his humor or his bulls. Withal he was by no means
3684,CONDY O’NEAL.,"touchy, and could laugh very heartily at a joke even at his own expense."
3685,CONDY O’NEAL.,But it was among the girls that his powers were most fully displayed; no
3686,CONDY O’NEAL.,professor of blarney could outshine Condy in the art of flattery. When
3687,CONDY O’NEAL.,"in the society of the fair, Condy’s eloquence was unbounded: the torrent"
3688,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of compliments, jokes, and blunders flowed with unpausing rapidity. It"
3689,CONDY O’NEAL.,"is, therefore, not to be wondered at that he became a leading man in"
3690,CONDY O’NEAL.,"conversation, and that our country beau, one and all, felt themselves"
3691,CONDY O’NEAL.,"below par in his presence. Condy was not slow to remark this, and"
3692,CONDY O’NEAL.,infinite was the pleasure he took in teasing them as often as
3693,CONDY O’NEAL.,opportunity offered. No sooner did he observe a beau looking
3694,CONDY O’NEAL.,"particularly tender at one of the lasses, than Condy took upon himself"
3695,CONDY O’NEAL.,to cut him out; and many an evening has he thus consumed in wronging a
3696,CONDY O’NEAL.,poor dog of a lover.
3697,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3698,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“The man whom Condy chiefly delighted to torment was a young farmer,"
3699,CONDY O’NEAL.,"named John Bingaman, a man of great stature and prodigious strength—the"
3700,CONDY O’NEAL.,hero of all the broils and boxing-matches in the country. These
3701,CONDY O’NEAL.,"boxing-matches are now out of fashion, but at the time of which I am"
3702,CONDY O’NEAL.,"speaking, they were very common; each county having one or more"
3703,CONDY O’NEAL.,"champions, who often tried their prowess against those of the"
3704,CONDY O’NEAL.,neighboring counties. In these contests John had never yet found his
3705,CONDY O’NEAL.,"match; and his temper had, in consequence, become so proud and"
3706,CONDY O’NEAL.,"overbearing, as to render him an object of dislike to all his"
3707,CONDY O’NEAL.,acquaintance. John’s air of superiority was intolerable to Condy. He
3708,CONDY O’NEAL.,felt himself to be John’s superior in all but brute force; and was
3709,CONDY O’NEAL.,grieved to think that so thick-skulled a mortal should be at all noticed
3710,CONDY O’NEAL.,"by the side of a man of mind like Condy O’Neal. On the other hand, John"
3711,CONDY O’NEAL.,was equally chagrined by the deference paid to so diminutive a creature
3712,CONDY O’NEAL.,as Condy. He was perpetually galled by Condy’s remarks on the
3713,CONDY O’NEAL.,superiority of mind over muscle—of wit over strength. He felt that his
3714,CONDY O’NEAL.,"former influence was sadly impaired; and how to re-establish it, was"
3715,CONDY O’NEAL.,beyond his contrivance. To attempt to pick a quarrel with Condy and flog
3716,CONDY O’NEAL.,"him, would, he was aware, be useless; for, in the first place, Condy was"
3717,CONDY O’NEAL.,too well acquainted with his rival’s bodily powers to risk a battle;
3718,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and, secondly, Condy’s superiority, resting in his wit, could not be"
3719,CONDY O’NEAL.,"beaten out of him by kicks and cuffs. John, therefore, concluded that it"
3720,CONDY O’NEAL.,would be best to bear Condy’s presence with patience; certain that the
3721,CONDY O’NEAL.,"roving disposition natural to school-masters must, ere long, remove the"
3722,CONDY O’NEAL.,"evil from his sight. In the mean time, however, he resolved to wreak his"
3723,CONDY O’NEAL.,vengeance by playing all manner of boorish practical jokes upon Condy.
3724,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3725,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“One evening, late in autumn, Condy, John, and a number more, found"
3726,CONDY O’NEAL.,"themselves assembled at a husking frolic, where John, whose Dulcinea was"
3727,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of the party, exerted himself to the utmost to get the better of Condy;"
3728,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and, by dint of tripping up his heels and then burying him beneath a"
3729,CONDY O’NEAL.,"huge heap of corn-husks, or pushing him headlong over a row of lasses"
3730,CONDY O’NEAL.,"seated at their work, he contrived to keep the laughers on his own side."
3731,CONDY O’NEAL.,"Condy bore all this with his characteristic good humor, until, the"
3732,CONDY O’NEAL.,"business of the evening having been nearly completed, and his scheme of"
3733,CONDY O’NEAL.,"vengeance matured, he suddenly assumed the air of a man whose patience"
3734,CONDY O’NEAL.,"is exhausted, and let fall a menace of revenge. Irritated by such a"
3735,CONDY O’NEAL.,"speech from a man like Condy, John roughly seized him by the shoulder,"
3736,CONDY O’NEAL.,and demanded to know what he was threatening. ‘What I may never be able
3737,CONDY O’NEAL.,"to undo,’ replied Condy, gravely. ‘And what may that be?’ asked John."
3738,CONDY O’NEAL.,"‘Why, Mister Bingaman, I could clap a horse’s head upon your shoulders,"
3739,CONDY O’NEAL.,and that is more than I could take off again.’ John burst into an
3740,CONDY O’NEAL.,"outrageous fit of laughter, and dared Condy to the trial. ‘No! no!’ said"
3741,CONDY O’NEAL.,"Condy, ‘I don’t want to do you an injury. I could easily put a horse’s"
3742,CONDY O’NEAL.,"head upon you, but if I should do so, there it must stick as long as you"
3743,CONDY O’NEAL.,"live: I could not take it off.’ ‘Try your best,’ again cried John; ‘I am"
3744,CONDY O’NEAL.,"not afraid of you.’ ‘Well, well,’ replied Condy, ‘as you doubt my"
3745,CONDY O’NEAL.,"ability, I’ll just do something for a small bit that shall harm no one,"
3746,CONDY O’NEAL.,and convince you of the truth of what I said about the horse’s head.
3747,CONDY O’NEAL.,"Now, John, strong as you are, I will undertake to make a cat pull you"
3748,CONDY O’NEAL.,"across that creek by a rope. Will you bet me a joe upon it?’ ‘Done,’"
3749,CONDY O’NEAL.,"cried John; ‘post your joe.’ The money was regularly staked, when Condy,"
3750,CONDY O’NEAL.,"turning to the company, requested them to adjourn to the farm-house,"
3751,CONDY O’NEAL.,"where he would presently join them, in order to make some necessary"
3752,CONDY O’NEAL.,"preparations. Condy went to his school-room, which was not very far off,"
3753,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and in a few minutes returned, bearing a sheet of paper, a pencil, a"
3754,CONDY O’NEAL.,"pair of dividers, and a Gunter’s scale. Entering the house, he found the"
3755,CONDY O’NEAL.,"company very merry upon the occasion. At first, all was laughter and"
3756,CONDY O’NEAL.,"jesting at Condy’s expense; but he, nothing moved thereby, seated"
3757,CONDY O’NEAL.,himself with the most imperturbable gravity by the side of a table;
3758,CONDY O’NEAL.,"while John, with a grin of anticipated triumph on his visage, seated"
3759,CONDY O’NEAL.,himself opposite and watched his motions. Condy pored intently upon his
3760,CONDY O’NEAL.,"scale, then adjusted his dividers upon it, and proceeded to draw three"
3761,CONDY O’NEAL.,concentric circles upon the paper. In the central circle he wrote JOHN
3762,CONDY O’NEAL.,"BINGAMAN, and within the two outer he drew a number of strange figures"
3763,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of animals, birds, insects, etc. During this process, which was"
3764,CONDY O’NEAL.,"conducted with great solemnity and extreme slowness, John’s phiz"
3765,CONDY O’NEAL.,"gradually lost its comic expression, and assumed a dolorous cast. The"
3766,CONDY O’NEAL.,"whole company caught the infection of solemnity, and, to noise and"
3767,CONDY O’NEAL.,"merriment, there succeeded a silence so dead, that the sound of Condy’s"
3768,CONDY O’NEAL.,pencil was distinctly audible as it slowly passed over the paper. Having
3769,CONDY O’NEAL.,"now tickled his audience to the proper point, Condy arose, and, in a"
3770,CONDY O’NEAL.,"solemn tone, said, ‘John Bingaman!’ John rose from his seat with a"
3771,CONDY O’NEAL.,"visage rueful as his who drew King Priam’s curtains in the night, to"
3772,CONDY O’NEAL.,"tell him that his warlike son was dead. ‘John Bingaman!’ Condy repeated,"
3773,CONDY O’NEAL.,‘put your finger upon this magic circle and acknowledge it for your hand
3774,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and seal.’ Spite of his natural intrepidity, John’s superstitious fears"
3775,CONDY O’NEAL.,"had completely overpowered him, and he stood gazing upon Condy, while"
3776,CONDY O’NEAL.,his knees almost smote together with apprehension. ‘John Bingaman!’
3777,CONDY O’NEAL.,"again said Condy, ‘do you refuse to acknowledge this to be your hand and"
3778,CONDY O’NEAL.,"seal?’ John muttered something unintelligibly. ‘Well,’ said Condy, ‘then"
3779,CONDY O’NEAL.,the bet is lost—the joe is mine.’ The idea of so easily parting with his
3780,CONDY O’NEAL.,"joe, and the fear of the ridicule which began already to manifest itself"
3781,CONDY O’NEAL.,"in the titters of the company, recalled John from his stupor, and,"
3782,CONDY O’NEAL.,"hastily clapping his finger upon the fatal circle, he said, ‘This is my"
3783,CONDY O’NEAL.,"hand and seal, confound you!—now make what you please of it.’ ‘’Tis"
3784,CONDY O’NEAL.,"well!’ said Condy, with solemnity, folding his paper and gathering up"
3785,CONDY O’NEAL.,his drawing instruments: ‘now I must ask the assistance of the company
3786,CONDY O’NEAL.,"in this affair. The cat must be black, a female which has never had"
3787,CONDY O’NEAL.,"kittens, and must weigh two pounds exactly.’ He also informed them that"
3788,CONDY O’NEAL.,the proposed feat could be performed only when both sun and moon were
3789,CONDY O’NEAL.,below the horizon.
3790,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3791,CONDY O’NEAL.,“The company dispersed. John went away with a feeling of dread for which
3792,CONDY O’NEAL.,"he could not account, and which, with his utmost exertions, he failed to"
3793,CONDY O’NEAL.,dispel. Could Condy be serious? Could he really make so diminutive a
3794,CONDY O’NEAL.,creature perform what he had proposed? Yet there was nothing like
3795,CONDY O’NEAL.,"jesting in Condy’s manner, and he was not the man to throw away a joe"
3796,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and at the same time risk a dozen kicks from John, besides incurring the"
3797,CONDY O’NEAL.,ridicule of the whole vicinity. John shook his wise head again and
3798,CONDY O’NEAL.,"again, but could not attain to any satisfactory conclusion. Condy sought"
3799,CONDY O’NEAL.,his home in a very different mood. He laughed heartily as soon as he was
3800,CONDY O’NEAL.,"in his own room: for now he had his mighty rival in his power, and"
3801,CONDY O’NEAL.,"could, without fail, expose him, a laughing-stock, to the whole county."
3802,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3803,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“As to the rest of the company, they viewed the matter in various"
3804,CONDY O’NEAL.,"lights. The more superstitious portion, awed by the solemnity of the"
3805,CONDY O’NEAL.,"pedagogue, looked upon him with mingled fear and admiration; while the"
3806,CONDY O’NEAL.,"less credulous part, most of them young, laughed, chatted, jested, and"
3807,CONDY O’NEAL.,laid wagers upon the success of the plot. As more than a week must pass
3808,CONDY O’NEAL.,"before the day fixed upon for the decision of the wager, there was full"
3809,CONDY O’NEAL.,"time for gossiping; and innumerable were the tales of witchcraft,"
3810,CONDY O’NEAL.,"ghosts, and horrors which that interval brought forth. Each veteran"
3811,CONDY O’NEAL.,"talker, male or female, had one or more marvellous tales wherewith to"
3812,CONDY O’NEAL.,"entertain the fireside assembly, and send the children to bed half"
3813,CONDY O’NEAL.,terrified out of their reason.
3814,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3815,CONDY O’NEAL.,“During this time Condy was more busy and more solemn than he had ever
3816,CONDY O’NEAL.,before been known to be. Every nook and corner was searched for the
3817,CONDY O’NEAL.,"mystical cat, and as he paraded the streets in anxious quest, every one"
3818,CONDY O’NEAL.,"ran to his door to look at Condy, as if he had been some strange"
3819,CONDY O’NEAL.,"creature from lands unknown. At length the cat was found, but where he"
3820,CONDY O’NEAL.,had procured her he would not tell. This led people to the very rational
3821,CONDY O’NEAL.,"conclusion that she had been lent for the express purpose by the devil,"
3822,CONDY O’NEAL.,"or that she was one of the witches who, about that period, greatly"
3823,CONDY O’NEAL.,infested the ‘east countrie.’
3824,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3825,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“On the appointed evening John and Condy, accompanied by about one"
3826,CONDY O’NEAL.,"hundred persons, repaired to the spot on which we are now sitting, where"
3827,CONDY O’NEAL.,Condy had warned them all to remain: informing them that if any one
3828,CONDY O’NEAL.,crossed the creek he must do it at the risk of being torn to pieces by
3829,CONDY O’NEAL.,the devil. This tree at that time stood on the bank with one half of its
3830,CONDY O’NEAL.,naked roots projecting over the water—the earth having been washed away
3831,CONDY O’NEAL.,"by the floods. Here John took his seat, his body reclining against the"
3832,CONDY O’NEAL.,"foot of the tree, his feet firmly planted against a root, and either"
3833,CONDY O’NEAL.,hand grasping a root by his side. Condy tied the rope securely about
3834,CONDY O’NEAL.,"John’s body, and then crossed the creek, carrying the other end of the"
3835,CONDY O’NEAL.,rope to a spot a few yards from the water. You have planted a very
3836,CONDY O’NEAL.,"pretty hedge garden near the water’s edge, but at the time of which I"
3837,CONDY O’NEAL.,"speak the shore was bare, and about ten yards from the water was a fence"
3838,CONDY O’NEAL.,"with a thick growth of alders and rank weeds. Condy, having fastened his"
3839,CONDY O’NEAL.,"cat to the rope, proceeded to describe a large circle round her,"
3840,CONDY O’NEAL.,muttering incantations and contriving so to spin out the time as to
3841,CONDY O’NEAL.,leave as little light as possible on the transaction. The crowd upon the
3842,CONDY O’NEAL.,bank stood awestruck in silent expectation. John
3843,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3844,CONDY O’NEAL.,"‘With half shut eyes, pucker’d cheeks,"
3845,CONDY O’NEAL.,"And teeth presented bare,’"
3846,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3847,CONDY O’NEAL.,"sat grasping the roots on either side, a very picture of melancholy"
3848,CONDY O’NEAL.,"desperation. Condy, having prolonged his preparatory measures until it"
3849,CONDY O’NEAL.,"had become tolerably dark, notified John that he must look out, for he"
3850,CONDY O’NEAL.,was now about to give the fatal pull. At this unwelcome intelligence
3851,CONDY O’NEAL.,"John’s breath came thick and hard. Condy whipped his cat, and cried"
3852,CONDY O’NEAL.,"‘_come!_’—the cat squalled, and John squeezed the roots with the gripe"
3853,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of a giant, but remained unmoved. Condy now addressed the stars and"
3854,CONDY O’NEAL.,"planets, calling several by name, whipped his cat, and again cried"
3855,CONDY O’NEAL.,‘_come!_’ and again John gave the roots a more than affectionate
3856,CONDY O’NEAL.,"squeeze. Condy now talked Irish to his cat, whipped her, upbraided the"
3857,CONDY O’NEAL.,"stars with their neglect of him, and cried ‘_come!_’—still John"
3858,CONDY O’NEAL.,"maintained his position, while the cat seemed unable even to stretch the"
3859,CONDY O’NEAL.,heavy rope to which she and John were attached. This farce of whipping
3860,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and calling having been repeated for nearly a quarter of an hour, John"
3861,CONDY O’NEAL.,began to suspect that Condy had brought him thither for the purpose of
3862,CONDY O’NEAL.,"making a fool of him. Irritated by this idea, he incautiously arose from"
3863,CONDY O’NEAL.,"his recumbent posture, and with divers oaths and curses, demanded to"
3864,CONDY O’NEAL.,"know what Condy meant. Condy seeing John thus off his guard, plied his"
3865,CONDY O’NEAL.,"cat with Irish and hickory most energetically, and cried ‘_now come!_’"
3866,CONDY O’NEAL.,"So said, so done: down went John into the creek. The crowd fled from the"
3867,CONDY O’NEAL.,"spot with a universal cry of horror. John, after having sunk for a"
3868,CONDY O’NEAL.,"moment in the deep water, reappeared on the surface—cut his way through"
3869,CONDY O’NEAL.,the stream with the foaming rapidity of a steamboat—ploughed through the
3870,CONDY O’NEAL.,"mud of the opposite shore, and brought up against the old worn fence"
3871,CONDY O’NEAL.,with a shock that tumbled it in ruins to the earth. Condy hastily cut
3872,CONDY O’NEAL.,"the rope, and lifting the heap of rails from his body, begged him, for"
3873,CONDY O’NEAL.,"God’s sake, to make the best of his way across the creek, ‘or the devil"
3874,CONDY O’NEAL.,would tear him to pieces.’ John needed not much persuasion to induce him
3875,CONDY O’NEAL.,"to this course, and he dashed through the water little less rapidly than"
3876,CONDY O’NEAL.,"when the cat helped him on. He afterward affirmed, with many an oath,"
3877,CONDY O’NEAL.,"that, turning his head during this passage, he saw a fiery-eyed, black"
3878,CONDY O’NEAL.,"monster, of the size of a bull, and bearing with him a strong odor of"
3879,CONDY O’NEAL.,"brimstone, leap from the bushes and pursue him to the middle of the"
3880,CONDY O’NEAL.,stream.
3881,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3882,CONDY O’NEAL.,“Thus ended the business of the night. John went home as if he had had a
3883,CONDY O’NEAL.,"thousand devils at his heels. Condy marched deliberately to his lodging,"
3884,CONDY O’NEAL.,exulting in the certainty of having forever humbled his mighty rival.
3885,CONDY O’NEAL.,"How did his heart swell with the idea of having, little as he was,"
3886,CONDY O’NEAL.,"conquered the mightiest man in Chester County! ‘Now,’ said he to"
3887,CONDY O’NEAL.,"himself, ‘John is down, and so I will keep him; as often as he attempts"
3888,CONDY O’NEAL.,"to bully or look big, I have only to remind him of this night’s"
3889,CONDY O’NEAL.,"adventure and his crest will fall. Lord! what a time I shall have of it,"
3890,CONDY O’NEAL.,and what a nourish I shall cut among the girls! Not a man of those
3891,CONDY O’NEAL.,boobies will dare to open his mouth where Condy O’Neal happens to be.’
3892,CONDY O’NEAL.,"Thus did Condy exult, little thinking of the fate which awaited him. He"
3893,CONDY O’NEAL.,"had no idea that, at this happy moment, his evil genius was filling the"
3894,CONDY O’NEAL.,vials of his wrath in order to pour them on his devoted head.
3895,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3896,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“Condy slept soundly, and having risen, proceeded, at the usual hour, to"
3897,CONDY O’NEAL.,"his school-house, where he found all silent and lonely. There was no"
3898,CONDY O’NEAL.,"fire in the stove, nor was there a human being visible. What could it"
3899,CONDY O’NEAL.,"mean? Condy looked at his watch and then at the sun, but both affirmed"
3900,CONDY O’NEAL.,"that the hour was 9, A. M. Was this a holyday? No! Christmas does not"
3901,CONDY O’NEAL.,"come in November, and that is the nearest holyday. Condy mused as he"
3902,CONDY O’NEAL.,"prepared to kindle a fire, endeavoring to discover the probable reason"
3903,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of the desertion of his flock. His musings, however, were interrupted by"
3904,CONDY O’NEAL.,"the arrival of a middle-aged matron, followed by her children and a"
3905,CONDY O’NEAL.,"dozen scholars besides, who began to gather up books, slates, etc., and"
3906,CONDY O’NEAL.,"to decamp without even the ceremony of good-by! Condy, not a little"
3907,CONDY O’NEAL.,"surprised, demanded the reason of this extempore proceeding. Madam"
3908,CONDY O’NEAL.,"replied, that neither she nor her neighbors could think of sending their"
3909,CONDY O’NEAL.,children to a teacher who had dealings with the devil. This was too much
3910,CONDY O’NEAL.,"for Condy’s gravity, and loud and long did he laugh as madam retreated"
3911,CONDY O’NEAL.,"from the room. After his fit of merriment had subsided, Condy sat down"
3912,CONDY O’NEAL.,to consider what was best to be done. ‘To argue with these people would
3913,CONDY O’NEAL.,"be useless, and to reveal the secret of the trick upon John, might be"
3914,CONDY O’NEAL.,"only to hand my bones over to the surgeon for repairs. Well, I suppose"
3915,CONDY O’NEAL.,"there are other places, besides this, where the children lack learning."
3916,CONDY O’NEAL.,So there is no use in grieving about the business; for if I were as sad
3917,CONDY O’NEAL.,"as the bottom of a cherry-pie, I could not mend matters a whit! It is"
3918,CONDY O’NEAL.,"very provoking, though, to have to run off in the moment of signal"
3919,CONDY O’NEAL.,victory. But I suppose I must say farewell to Chester County.’
3920,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3921,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“Condy collected what was due to him by his patrons, and went off to"
3922,CONDY O’NEAL.,"Bucks County, thence to Montgomery, and so forth, seeking a situation,"
3923,CONDY O’NEAL.,"but in vain, for the story of his necromantic exploit had preceded him"
3924,CONDY O’NEAL.,"with the most awful exaggerations. Still he kept up a good heart, but"
3925,CONDY O’NEAL.,"soon began to find that his pocket was growing alarmingly light, and"
3926,CONDY O’NEAL.,"that, unless something was done to restore its gravity, he must be"
3927,CONDY O’NEAL.,"famished. Upon arriving at this very natural conclusion, he faced about,"
3928,CONDY O’NEAL.,"resolved to go to Virginia, where, under a feigned name and at a"
3929,CONDY O’NEAL.,"sufficient distance from the theatre of his unlucky celebrity, he might"
3930,CONDY O’NEAL.,‘teach the young idea how to shoot’ in full security.
3931,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3932,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“His knapsack was already buckled on, his bill paid, his half gill"
3933,CONDY O’NEAL.,"disposed of, and his staff grasped in his dexter hand, when he was"
3934,CONDY O’NEAL.,"surprised by the apparition of one of his comrades from Chester, who"
3935,CONDY O’NEAL.,"shook him most cordially by the hand, laughed heartily, slapped his"
3936,CONDY O’NEAL.,"shoulder, and swore that he was the cleverest fellow in the world. ‘Come"
3937,CONDY O’NEAL.,"Condy,’ said he, ‘you must come with me to Chester. It is all out about"
3938,CONDY O’NEAL.,"the cat; and look here, my old boy!’ Saying this he unfolded a"
3939,CONDY O’NEAL.,"school-subscription paper, containing a most imposing array of"
3940,CONDY O’NEAL.,"signatures, the signers promising ‘severally to pay unto Condy O’Neal"
3941,CONDY O’NEAL.,"the sums unto their names annexed,’ etc., etc."
3942,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3943,CONDY O’NEAL.,“I must now inform you how the matter of the cat had been managed. On
3944,CONDY O’NEAL.,the evening preceding that on which John followed the cat with so much
3945,CONDY O’NEAL.,"rapidity and so little good will, Condy took Adam North and myself, whom"
3946,CONDY O’NEAL.,"he had let into the secret, to the shore yonder. We had with us a good"
3947,CONDY O’NEAL.,"rope, which we buried slightly in the mud; one end touching the spot"
3948,CONDY O’NEAL.,"where Condy was to make his circle, the other end being drawn through"
3949,CONDY O’NEAL.,the fence and concealed amid the weeds and alders. A stout stick about
3950,CONDY O’NEAL.,"two feet long, tied by the middle to this end of the rope, was to serve"
3951,CONDY O’NEAL.,"us as a handle. On the appointed evening, some time before sunset, North"
3952,CONDY O’NEAL.,"and I took our fishing-rods and wandered down the stream, pretending to"
3953,CONDY O’NEAL.,"be very busy fishing; and when evening approached, we laid our rods"
3954,CONDY O’NEAL.,aside and crept into the midst of the bushes at the place where our rope
3955,CONDY O’NEAL.,"lay, which we found as we had left it on the preceding evening. Our"
3956,CONDY O’NEAL.,"instructions were, to remain quietly at our post, having our hands upon"
3957,CONDY O’NEAL.,"the stick, until Condy should cry, ‘now come!’ when we were to run. We"
3958,CONDY O’NEAL.,"were mightily tickled, as you may suppose, with the idea of the ducking"
3959,CONDY O’NEAL.,and fright we were about to give the big bully; but our pleasure was not
3960,CONDY O’NEAL.,"a little damped by a most unexpected apparition. North had, on leaving"
3961,CONDY O’NEAL.,"home, tied up his dog, a huge black deerhound, for fear of his betraying"
3962,CONDY O’NEAL.,us by his barking; but shortly after the people had begun to assemble on
3963,CONDY O’NEAL.,"this bank, we saw the black rascal coming toward us with his nose to the"
3964,CONDY O’NEAL.,"ground. Our only resource, then, was, in making him lie down with us and"
3965,CONDY O’NEAL.,"keep quiet; but, to our utter dismay, when he came up to the place where"
3966,CONDY O’NEAL.,"we lay, we discovered that he had killed a skunk by the way. There was,"
3967,CONDY O’NEAL.,"however, no help for us; and we had to lie close, enduring the horrible"
3968,CONDY O’NEAL.,"stench for nearly half an hour. When we started up to run, the hound"
3969,CONDY O’NEAL.,started with us; but hearing the mighty splash made by John in his
3970,CONDY O’NEAL.,"voyage, and fancying, probably, that a deer had run into the creek, he"
3971,CONDY O’NEAL.,"wheeled about, gave tongue, and ran toward the water, where he arrived"
3972,CONDY O’NEAL.,just in time to follow John into the stream. This occasioned John’s
3973,CONDY O’NEAL.,mistake about the monster and the smell of brimstone.
3974,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3975,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“The secret had been too good to be kept; and North, notwithstanding the"
3976,CONDY O’NEAL.,danger to which he thereby subjected himself of a hearty thumping from
3977,CONDY O’NEAL.,"John, told the whole matter (confidentially of course) to a few dozens"
3978,CONDY O’NEAL.,"of his intimate friends, and so the whole matter came to light. I must"
3979,CONDY O’NEAL.,confess I was horribly afraid when I found it had got wind; but John
3980,CONDY O’NEAL.,"never betrayed any ill feeling toward us. Upon Condy, however, he vowed"
3981,CONDY O’NEAL.,"vengeance most dire. On the matter becoming public, John was driven"
3982,CONDY O’NEAL.,almost mad; for he was roasted without mercy wherever he went. Fancy
3983,CONDY O’NEAL.,also came to the aid of reality; and he imagined that there was an
3984,CONDY O’NEAL.,"allusion to his defeat as often as cats, or ropes, or water, or Irish"
3985,CONDY O’NEAL.,school-masters were mentioned. He even ran out of the church when the
3986,CONDY O’NEAL.,"parson, one Sunday, read the story of the Egyptians in the Red Sea."
3987,CONDY O’NEAL.,
3988,CONDY O’NEAL.,"“If poor John was now down, Condy was in proportion elated. His school"
3989,CONDY O’NEAL.,"nourished to the utmost extent of his wishes; his finances were, of"
3990,CONDY O’NEAL.,"course, considerably increased; his popularity, with both male and"
3991,CONDY O’NEAL.,"female, was unbounded; and his vanity and good humor were augmented"
3992,CONDY O’NEAL.,"tenfold. The grin was never absent from his mouth, and he laughed and"
3993,CONDY O’NEAL.,chuckled over his cat exploit as if he had conquered a kingdom. John
3994,CONDY O’NEAL.,studiously avoided him; and whenever accident brought them into each
3995,CONDY O’NEAL.,"other’s company, Condy swelled and looked as big as if he could have"
3996,CONDY O’NEAL.,eaten him up at a single sitting.”

4226,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Athwart the tide, and blended with the light"
4227,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"The kindling stars flung forth, and yellow moon"

4236,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Here towering rock frowning in grand array,"
4237,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,Whence springs the eagle forth to welcome day;
4238,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"There valleys slanting to the margin green,"

4241,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,
4242,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Now the thick forests touch’d with autumn hues,"

4246,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Between its lofty banks, that then were shelv’d"
4247,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,To admit of all the glory of the sky;
4248,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,The distant mountains rearing their proud brows
4249,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"O’er all the view, that tremulously glows."
4250,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,
4251,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Glows in the silvery light, that not alone"

4255,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,That every inmost slumbering chord awoke.
4256,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,It seem’d as though his soul imbibed a ray
4257,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Of that ethereal light, that all around"
4258,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"The gentle earth, with shining cycles bound."
4259,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,
4260,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Or did the aerial spirit by his side,"
4261,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,That gave him thus immortally to glide
4262,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Over her moist dominions, on him pour"
4263,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"More than the spell unearthly things to view,"
4264,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,But the glad gush of spiritual feelings too;
4265,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,For then the poet deem’d that one such hour
4266,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Of brief enchanted happiness, were worth"
4267,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,A thousand years of feelings but of earth.
4268,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,
4269,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,The spirit now lent him her aid to see
4270,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Things that, to us, must lie in mystery;"
4271,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Visions unborn of time, which future years"
4272,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Shall make reality, and men shall know"
4273,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Stripp’d of the strangeness, that events will throw"

4276,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,The beacon-torch of virtue to discern?
4277,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,
4278,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,But that alone to guide them o’er the steep
4279,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"And shelving rocks, hid by the ocean deep"
4280,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,Of life; away—the theme we may not tell.
4281,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"Suffice it that the poet’s heart was glad,"
4282,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"And could it be, if what he heard were sad?"
4283,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"And now they touch’d the land, and reach’d a dell—"

4293,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"While odors that no censers seem’d to hold,"

4295,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,
4296,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"And dance went round, a graceful flying maze"

4299,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"A light, that from the kindling stars is caught,"

4301,BY ELIZABETH MARY ALLISON.,"But all their brightest wassailage—oh, none"

4409,I.,By one whose warm affections
4410,I.,"On her wondrous beauty hung,"

4421,II.,A mother!—yet believing
4422,II.,Life’s duties scarce begun—
4423,II.,Whose childhood seemed of yesterday
4424,II.,In its unclouded sun;
4425,II.,So early had the story

4437,III.,So priceless was the treasure
4438,III.,"Her throbbing bosom bore,"
4439,III.,So centered was her spirit now
4440,III.,On one she could adore!
4441,III.,Where is he!—Ah! her vision
4442,III.,Is of shadowy ships and seas—
4443,III.,And _for_ him the unuttered prayer
4444,III.,Is poured on bended knees.
4445,III.,Each day in thought she follows
4446,III.,"His stormy ocean track,"
4447,III.,And every dreamy midnight still
4448,III.,Her pillow brings him back.
4449,III.,For he—for distant regions
4450,III.,"Torn early from her side,—"

4459,IV.,Of fadeless love—and of cruel fate

4461,IV.,Years fled—and still he wandered—

4632,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4633,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Steeped in a mild unclouded moonlight, the storied domes, arches and"
4634,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"pinnacles of Venice, once mistress of the Adriatic, and still the most"
4635,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"interesting of Italian cities, lay sleeping in surpassing loveliness."
4636,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Venice, like Melrose, is best viewed when lit up by the pale lunar beam"
4637,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,which permits the dark shadows of its palaces to hide the decay of their
4638,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"crumbling foundations—which softens its few faults of architecture, and"
4639,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,blends each airy and ethereal turret with the dusk of the deep sky
4640,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"itself. The soft illumination, mellowing and mingling their wave-worn"
4641,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"halls and arches, awakes the luxurious inhabitants to life and"
4642,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"animation. Dark gondolas, filled with masks and music begin to glide"
4643,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"along the shadowy canals, marking the course they take by the undulating"
4644,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"reflection of their lamps in the water. Here and there, from the windows"
4645,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"of some haughty palace, whence a flood of radiance is poured upon the"
4646,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"night, contrasting with the moonbeams as it falls upon the stream"
4647,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"without, may be heard the resounding din of instrumental music, timing"
4648,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,the steps of dancers in the halls within.
4649,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4650,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Where the shadow fell darkest from a mighty pile, shrouding all below, a"
4651,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"noble maiden bent from a balcony, and listened to a lover’s serenade."
4652,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"She stood, screened from the light, and motionless, rapt in mute"
4653,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"attention, while the cavalier beneath her struck his guitar with"
4654,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"matchless skill, and sang a canzonet that breathed the very soul of"
4655,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"passion. At length the music died meltingly away, and the lady was about"
4656,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,to retire from the balcony.
4657,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4658,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“Hist, Contessa!” whispered the singer of the gondola; “you will not"
4659,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,leave me so suddenly?”
4660,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4661,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“I cannot converse with a stranger, though he be masked,” answered the"
4662,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"lady, “for it is not carnival time.”"
4663,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4664,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“You jest, beautiful Antonia,” replied the cavalier. “You would not have"
4665,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,listened to my serenade had you not recognized my voice.”
4666,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4667,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“You are right, Count,” said the lady, with a light laugh. “I know you."
4668,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"But be brief; for my uncle is within, and I dare not delay. Why are you"
4669,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,here?”
4670,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4671,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“_Why_, Antonia? Do _you_ ask me? I am going to quit Venice to-night: it"
4672,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"is like quitting hope, for I know not when I shall see you again.”"
4673,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4674,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,“Then you will not be at Rome at the carnival? I am going thither with
4675,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"my uncle,” said the lady."
4676,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4677,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“If I dared,” muttered the cavalier with hesitation. “But it shall be"
4678,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"so, Antonia—I will brave every thing. At Rome, then, we will meet"
4679,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,again—at the carnival.”
4680,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4681,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,“Fail not!” said the Venetian lady.
4682,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4683,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“I will meet you again if I live,” replied the cavalier passionately."
4684,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“And if I die, why, my spirit shall be with you.”"
4685,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4686,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,Here a slight sound was heard from the apartment behind the balcony. The
4687,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"lady wished her lover a hasty good-night, and vanished. The serenader"
4688,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"gave an order to his attendant in a low voice, and as the light barque"
4689,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,shot from the gloomy shadow of the palace into a bright streak of
4690,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"moonlight, a voice from the stern commenced the favorite “buona notte”"
4691,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,of the Venetian gondoliers. The youth and maiden were the Count Carriale
4692,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,and the beautiful Contessa Antonia Gazella. We shall rejoin them at the
4693,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,carnival.

4696,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4697,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,The lady Antonia appeared at Rome before the commencement of the
4698,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"carnival, and, as she was rich and a celebrated beauty, her arrival at"
4699,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,the eternal city was soon known and talked about. Even the English at
4700,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Rome were infected by the general enthusiasm, and forgot their national"
4701,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,taciturnity when they saw the Gazella in her open carriage on the Corso.
4702,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"She was the theme of general admiration. Artists and officers, counts"
4703,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"and cardinals, Britons and Americans, sounded the praises of the fair"
4704,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Contessa, and not a few of the impoverished nobility, fortune-hunters by"
4705,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"profession, ranked themselves in the train of the lovely Antonia."
4706,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4707,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"But cold was the maid, and though legions advanced,"
4708,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"All drilled by Ovidean art,"
4709,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Though they languished and ogled, protested and danced,"
4710,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Like shadows they came, and like shadows they glanced"
4711,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,From the cold polished ice of her heart.
4712,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4713,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,In fact the beautiful Contessa turned a deaf ear to every compliment;
4714,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"and if she listened for a moment to the Baron Von Konigsmarke, a"
4715,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"lieutenant colonel of Austrian hussars, it was because the haughty noble"
4716,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"professed to be actuated by a pure friendship; and, moreover, being a"
4717,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"man of repulsive manners and a dead shot, served to keep more"
4718,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"troublesome admirers at a distance. But even the Baron Von Konigsmarke,"
4719,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"handsome, talented, mustachioed, and blazing with orders, was forced to"
4720,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"give way, at the opening of the carnival, to a nameless mask, who"
4721,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,attached himself inseparably to the lovely lady.
4722,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4723,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,In no other Italian city does the carnival effect so great a revolution
4724,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,as it does in Rome. From whatever causes it arises—whether from the
4725,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"effect of dissipation, the force of superstition, or the daily"
4726,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,contemplation of vast and venerable ruins—the dwellers in the Holy City
4727,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"are grave to a proverb, except during the brief saturnalia licensed by"
4728,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"the Romish Church. Then, indeed, they rush to the opposite extreme of"
4729,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,the wildest gaiety and the utmost extravagance. The carnival presents
4730,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,the singular spectacle of a whole city systematically mad. It is a
4731,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"_festa_ for the noble, a “beggar’s opera” for the mendicants—and it is"
4732,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"hard to say which of the two classes enjoy it most. Fiddling, fluting,"
4733,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"dancing, drinking, driving, racing, intrigue, and pelting with comfits,"
4734,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,are a few of the most innocent and intellectual enjoyments of the reign
4735,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,of misrule.
4736,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4737,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,The commencement of the saturnalia brought an unfeigned pleasure to the
4738,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"gay Antonia, not only because she entered heartily into the fun of the"
4739,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"practical jests, but because she knew that there beat beside her in her"
4740,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,carriage that to which no passionate Italian is indifferent—a youthful
4741,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"and noble heart, warm, happy, and devoted to herself. It is needless to"
4742,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,say that the companion of her festive hours was the Count Carriale. The
4743,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,gaieties opened with brighter auspices than ever; for not one wretched
4744,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"criminal had been led to the block, to pour out his life for the"
4745,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"edification of the assembled gazers, according to the tender edict of"
4746,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"the sovereign pontiff, who wished, by the wholesome terror of an"
4747,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"execution, to withhold the multitude from the perpetration of those"
4748,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"crimes to which the license of a carnival might lead them. His holiness,"
4749,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"we are credibly informed, was much chagrined to think that no felon was"
4750,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"in prison whom, by a little extension of pontifical justice, he could"
4751,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"send in safety to the guillotine. Unfortunately for his wishes, the"
4752,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,pleasures began without the zest of a single death by the axe; they did
4753,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"not close, however, without a serious accident."
4754,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4755,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,As the Count Carriale was whispering some tender words in the ear of his
4756,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"beautiful mistress, the horses attached to their carriage took fright,"
4757,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"and they ran at full speed through the crowded streets, putting to"
4758,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,flight the gay masqueraders and their motley equipages wherever they
4759,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"appeared. At length, in turning a sharp corner, the vehicle was overset,"
4760,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,and the lady and the Count thrown with considerable violence to the
4761,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"pavement. The former, fortunately, was unhurt; but a captain of the"
4762,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"papal horseguards, who had dismounted to render his assistance,"
4763,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,perceived with dismay that a stream of blood flowed from the head of the
4764,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,wounded Count. The compassionate old soldier endeavored to remove the
4765,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,mask of the sufferer; but the Count seemed singularly unwilling to
4766,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,expose his face. The mask was at length drawn off by force; and then it
4767,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"was that the dragoon, with a cry of surprise and indignation, recognized"
4768,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"in the pretended Count Carriale, the lover of Antonia at Venice and at"
4769,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Rome, the features of Maffeo Accaioli, a formidable brigand whom he had"
4770,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,recently encountered on the mountains. The annunciation was no sooner
4771,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,made than the beautiful Contessa fainted.
4772,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,

4774,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4775,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,How pleased were all the Romans when it was announced that his holiness
4776,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"the Pope had, by a special exercise of his power, ordained that the"
4777,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"condemned brigand, the formidable Accaioli should be guillotined during"
4778,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,the carnival. How kind of him! The ladies were in ecstacies. Even the
4779,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"Countess Gazella was far from lamenting this ungenerous precipitation,"
4780,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,for a woman once duped never forgives her deceiver; and as she had
4781,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"already commenced an intimacy with the Baron Von Konigsmarke, she"
4782,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,adopted the opinion of the old song:—
4783,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4784,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,“’Tis well to be off with the old love
4785,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,Before you are on with the new.”
4786,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4787,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,A vast crowd assembled to witness the dying agonies of the brigand. He
4788,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"was escorted to the scaffold by the papal dragoons, and a long file of"
4789,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"penitents in their robes of sackcloth, bound at the waist with cords,"
4790,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,their gloomy eyes peering through holes cut for the purpose in their
4791,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,cowls. These pious monks begged alms of all good Catholics to aid their
4792,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,endeavors in getting the soul of the condemned through purgatory. The
4793,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"prisoner entered on the scaffold, attended by his confessor. He kissed"
4794,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"the cross, he received the last consolations of religion, he looked"
4795,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"firmly on the multitude, and lay down to die—the axe descended, and it"
4796,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,was all over.

4801,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,confessor of the dying brigand. He held a miniature in his hand.
4802,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,
4803,THE ITALIAN LOVER.,"“Yes,” he cried, “these are the lovely features of Rosa Vanelli—Rosa,"

5224,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And all around was hushed and still,"
5225,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Save paddle of the light canoe,"
5226,GNADENHUTTEN.,And wailing of the whippoorwill.
5227,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5228,GNADENHUTTEN.,"The moon was like a silver thread,"
5229,GNADENHUTTEN.,Just sinking in the green wood’s bosom;
5230,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And swift from heaven the night-dew sped,"
5231,GNADENHUTTEN.,With pearly gifts for leaf and blossom.
5232,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5233,GNADENHUTTEN.,And soft as balmy dews of night
5234,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Upon the beauteous blossom’s breast,"
5235,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Came slumber, and her finger light,"
5236,GNADENHUTTEN.,On every closing eyelid pressed.
5237,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5238,GNADENHUTTEN.,’Twas night—dark night—no sound arose—
5239,GNADENHUTTEN.,The weary eye forgot its weeping;
5240,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And wrapt in bonds of bland repose,"
5241,GNADENHUTTEN.,The missionary band lay sleeping.
5242,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5243,GNADENHUTTEN.,"But hark! upon the startled air,"
5244,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Wild, unexpected whoops arise!—"
5245,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And the red conflagration’s glare,"
5246,GNADENHUTTEN.,Is brightening all the midnight skies!
5247,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5248,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Up! sleepers, up! awake and fly,"
5249,GNADENHUTTEN.,By the dread lamp your foes have lighted—
5250,GNADENHUTTEN.,"To the dark green-wood’s bosom hie,"
5251,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Your homes are gone, your hopes are blighted."
5252,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5253,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Up! sleepers, up! away, away!"
5254,GNADENHUTTEN.,A canopy of smoke is o’er you;
5255,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Around you fiery streamers play,"
5256,GNADENHUTTEN.,And the dark savage is before you!
5257,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5258,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Perchance some home-fraught dream of joy,"
5259,GNADENHUTTEN.,In slumber’s silken links had bound them;
5260,GNADENHUTTEN.,They wake! ’tis but to hear the cry
5261,GNADENHUTTEN.,Of savage slaughter raging round them!
5262,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5263,GNADENHUTTEN.,They wake! ’tis but to mark the arm
5264,GNADENHUTTEN.,Of death above each brow impending;
5265,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Vain, vain, the shriek of wild alarm—"
5266,GNADENHUTTEN.,And vain the prayer for life ascending.
5267,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5268,GNADENHUTTEN.,"They died, as holy martyrs die—"
5269,GNADENHUTTEN.,Their latest thought to God was given;
5270,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Resigned their souls in agony,"
5271,GNADENHUTTEN.,To wake in ecstacy in heaven.
5272,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5273,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And perished all? One mother fled,"
5274,GNADENHUTTEN.,Escaping both the brand and arrow;
5275,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And to the midnight forest sped,"
5276,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Weary and weak, in pain and sorrow!"
5277,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5278,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Nor fled alone—in wild distress,"
5279,GNADENHUTTEN.,"A little one she fondly pressed,"
5280,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Sleeping in blessed unconsciousness,"
5281,GNADENHUTTEN.,Rocked by the throbbings of her breast.
5282,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5283,GNADENHUTTEN.,"For when the work of death was rife,"
5284,GNADENHUTTEN.,"’Midst savage yell and dying prayer,"
5285,GNADENHUTTEN.,"She fearless sought the thickest strife,"
5286,GNADENHUTTEN.,And found that little slumberer there.
5287,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5288,GNADENHUTTEN.,Trembling beneath a shed she crept—
5289,GNADENHUTTEN.,The babe still hushed upon her bosom—
5290,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Restrained each bursting throb, nor wept,"
5291,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Fearing to wake that slumbering blossom,"
5292,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5293,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And from her lowly hiding-place,"
5294,GNADENHUTTEN.,Heard every yell of savage slaughter!
5295,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And closer clasped in her embrace,"
5296,GNADENHUTTEN.,The babe she deemed her fair-haired daughter.
5297,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5298,GNADENHUTTEN.,At length the long night passed away—
5299,GNADENHUTTEN.,The morning rose in all its glory—
5300,GNADENHUTTEN.,"But smouldering ruins met his ray,"
5301,GNADENHUTTEN.,"And corpses cold, and pale, and gory."
5302,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5303,GNADENHUTTEN.,A midnight stillness reigned around—
5304,GNADENHUTTEN.,The savage foe had fled afar—
5305,GNADENHUTTEN.,"The Lehigh with its moaning sound,"
5306,GNADENHUTTEN.,Went wailing by the field of war.
5307,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5308,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Uprose that matron young and fair,"
5309,GNADENHUTTEN.,With trembling limb and beating heart—
5310,GNADENHUTTEN.,Why bursts her wild shriek on the air?
5311,GNADENHUTTEN.,And whence that horror-speaking start?
5312,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5313,GNADENHUTTEN.,She gazed upon that infant’s face
5314,GNADENHUTTEN.,With frenzied look and wild despair;
5315,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Clasped to her breast, in fond embrace,"
5316,GNADENHUTTEN.,An Indian babe lay sleeping there!
5317,GNADENHUTTEN.,
5318,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Nor pined she long in hopeless grief,"
5319,GNADENHUTTEN.,With every bond of being riven;
5320,GNADENHUTTEN.,"Death smiling came, a sure relief,"
5321,GNADENHUTTEN.,And angels winged her soul to heaven.
