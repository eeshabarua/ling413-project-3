79,PREFATORY NOTE,
80,PREFATORY NOTE,
81,PREFATORY NOTE,Every anthologist must adopt some plan for making selections. Mine has
82,PREFATORY NOTE,been very simple. I have made a small collection of poems that would
83,PREFATORY NOTE,have pleased the child I used to be and the boy who was my playmate.
84,PREFATORY NOTE,"Above all things I have striven to keep the book small, for the big"
85,PREFATORY NOTE,books of poetry on our shelves were always left to themselves. It was
86,PREFATORY NOTE,the little books that became our intimate companions.
87,PREFATORY NOTE,
88,PREFATORY NOTE,To make a selection for boys and girls from the countless riches of
89,PREFATORY NOTE,"lyric poetry in our language, and to reduce that selection to the"
90,PREFATORY NOTE,"contents of so small a book as this one, is a grave task. It involves"
91,PREFATORY NOTE,"the exclusion on the grounds of mere lack of space, of so much that one"
92,PREFATORY NOTE,loves. I should have liked to make a book of this size containing only
93,PREFATORY NOTE,"Elizabethan songs and early English ballads, another entirely devoted to"
94,PREFATORY NOTE,"Georgian and Victorian poets, a third to living writers, and a fourth to"
95,PREFATORY NOTE,"child-rhymes, parodies, nonsense verses and the like. If the grown-up"
96,PREFATORY NOTE,"reader regrets omissions, I beg him to be sympathetic toward the"
97,PREFATORY NOTE,"compiler, who has been a prey to those same regrets constantly during"
98,PREFATORY NOTE,the year in which she has been at work on the book. Alas that a volume
99,PREFATORY NOTE,cannot have the advantages of being both a big book and a little one at
100,PREFATORY NOTE,the same time!
101,PREFATORY NOTE,
102,PREFATORY NOTE,"In selecting the poems for the girl and boy who used to be, I have tried"
103,PREFATORY NOTE,always to read with their eyes. I have been guided from first to last by
104,PREFATORY NOTE,their enjoyment or their boredom. The poems that they loved best had
105,PREFATORY NOTE,"highly accented rhythms, and took them into “a land of clear colors and"
106,PREFATORY NOTE,"stories.” They enjoyed certain sad poems as much as merry ones, but"
107,PREFATORY NOTE,"meditative, moralistic and gloomy poems were never read but once, if"
108,PREFATORY NOTE,they were read at all. And I am glad to say that poems full of
109,PREFATORY NOTE,sentimentality fared no better. I have brought together much that has
110,PREFATORY NOTE,"been written since they were children, and boys and girls of to-day will"
111,PREFATORY NOTE,find among these poems many of the most enjoyable things in the book. To
112,PREFATORY NOTE,"mention only one recent poet that they would have loved, Walter de la"
113,PREFATORY NOTE,"Mare, is to realize how much a child has missed who does not possess his"
114,PREFATORY NOTE,inimitable “Peacock Pie.”
115,PREFATORY NOTE,
116,PREFATORY NOTE,"A child’s enjoyment, as I said above, is what I have striven for in this"
117,PREFATORY NOTE,collection. We who have seen how poetry has come to our rescue with its
118,PREFATORY NOTE,"delight, its healing, and its new courage in times of stress and sorrow,"
119,PREFATORY NOTE,know that it is an inestimable possession. We cannot come to the
120,PREFATORY NOTE,knowledge of it too early. If we can have a clear personal realization
121,PREFATORY NOTE,"while we are children, that we love poetry, no amount of well-meaning"
122,PREFATORY NOTE,but sometimes tactless and uninspired teaching of it in schools and
123,PREFATORY NOTE,colleges can shake us in the knowledge of that love. I remember that the
124,PREFATORY NOTE,first poem I was condemned to learn by heart in school was “The
125,PREFATORY NOTE,"Builders” by Longfellow. I say condemned, but it was not as a"
126,PREFATORY NOTE,punishment. Every child in the class had to learn it. It is one of the
127,PREFATORY NOTE,poems that I am sure the poet himself would never have given to a child
128,PREFATORY NOTE,"to learn, beginning, as grown-up readers will remember:"
129,PREFATORY NOTE,
130,PREFATORY NOTE,“All are Architects of Fate
131,PREFATORY NOTE,Working in these walls of Time.”
132,PREFATORY NOTE,
133,PREFATORY NOTE,"After committing the nine stanzas of this poem to memory, it took me a"
134,PREFATORY NOTE,long time to grow willing to read the stirring things that the same poet
135,PREFATORY NOTE,"has written, poems as interesting as this one is humdrum."
136,PREFATORY NOTE,
137,PREFATORY NOTE,But education is better managed now than then. Teachers and parents
138,PREFATORY NOTE,alike have come to feel that the love of poetry in general is more to be
139,PREFATORY NOTE,"desired for children than the knowledge of certain “well known” poems,"
140,PREFATORY NOTE,"no matter how good, or even how great, these poems may be. Besides a"
141,PREFATORY NOTE,"more tactfully managed education in the schools, there are children’s"
142,PREFATORY NOTE,rooms in the public libraries. I have wished many times during the
143,PREFATORY NOTE,"months spent in making this book, when visits to these rooms were an"
144,PREFATORY NOTE,"inspiration, that I might have browsed among the low shelves long ago in"
145,PREFATORY NOTE,"childhood, and talked with the same delightful librarians. I should like"
146,PREFATORY NOTE,"to express my thanks to these librarians, who have been so kind in"
147,PREFATORY NOTE,"various ways. I want especially to thank Annie Carroll Moore,"
148,PREFATORY NOTE,"Supervisor of Work with Children in the New York Public Library, who"
149,PREFATORY NOTE,knows the heart of a child from long travelling on “The Roads to
150,PREFATORY NOTE,Childhood.”
151,PREFATORY NOTE,
152,PREFATORY NOTE,In closing I shall quote briefly from the introduction by Andrew Lang to
153,PREFATORY NOTE,"his anthology for children, “The Blue Poetry Book,” for he speaks my own"
154,PREFATORY NOTE,thoughts better than I can express them: “It does not appear to the
155,PREFATORY NOTE,"Editor that poems about children, or especially intended for children,"
156,PREFATORY NOTE,are those which a child likes best. A child’s imaginative life is spent
157,PREFATORY NOTE,"in the unknown future, and in the romantic past.... The poems written"
158,PREFATORY NOTE,"for and about children rather appeal to the old, whose own childhood is"
159,PREFATORY NOTE,"now to them a distant fairy world, as the man’s life is to the child...."
160,PREFATORY NOTE,We make a mistake when we ‘write down’ to children; still more do we err
161,PREFATORY NOTE,when we tell a child not to read this or that because he cannot
162,PREFATORY NOTE,"understand it. He understands far more than we give him credit for, but"
163,PREFATORY NOTE,"nothing that can harm him. The half-understanding of it, too, the sense"
164,PREFATORY NOTE,"of a margin beyond, as in a wood full of unknown glades and birds and"
165,PREFATORY NOTE,"flowers unfamiliar, is a great part of a child’s pleasure in reading...."
166,PREFATORY NOTE,The child does not want everything to be explained. In the unexplained
167,PREFATORY NOTE,is great pleasure.”
168,PREFATORY NOTE,
169,PREFATORY NOTE,A number of my friends have been kind in giving me the names of poems
170,PREFATORY NOTE,that they liked best when they were children. The small compass of the
171,PREFATORY NOTE,book has made it impossible to use all of the poems suggested in this
172,PREFATORY NOTE,"way, but it has been a pleasure to include as many of them as I could. I"
173,PREFATORY NOTE,want to acknowledge very gratefully my indebtedness for counsel and
174,PREFATORY NOTE,"suggestions to John Gould Fletcher, Vachel Lindsay, Amy Lowell, Jessie"
175,PREFATORY NOTE,"B. Rittenhouse, Louis Untermeyer, Jean Untermeyer, John Hall Wheelock"
176,PREFATORY NOTE,and Marguerite Wilkinson.

473,KUBLA KHAN,
474,KUBLA KHAN,
475,KUBLA KHAN,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
476,KUBLA KHAN,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
477,KUBLA KHAN,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
478,KUBLA KHAN,Through caverns measureless to man
479,KUBLA KHAN,Down to a sunless sea.
480,KUBLA KHAN,So twice five miles of fertile ground
481,KUBLA KHAN,With walls and towers were girdled round:
482,KUBLA KHAN,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
483,KUBLA KHAN,Where blossom’d many an incense-bearing tree;
484,KUBLA KHAN,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
485,KUBLA KHAN,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
486,KUBLA KHAN,
487,KUBLA KHAN,But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
488,KUBLA KHAN,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
489,KUBLA KHAN,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
490,KUBLA KHAN,As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
491,KUBLA KHAN,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
492,KUBLA KHAN,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething"
493,KUBLA KHAN,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
494,KUBLA KHAN,A mighty fountain momently was forced:
495,KUBLA KHAN,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
496,KUBLA KHAN,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
497,KUBLA KHAN,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail;
498,KUBLA KHAN,And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
499,KUBLA KHAN,It flung up momently the sacred river.
500,KUBLA KHAN,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
501,KUBLA KHAN,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
502,KUBLA KHAN,"Then reach’d the caverns measureless to man,"
503,KUBLA KHAN,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
504,KUBLA KHAN,And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
505,KUBLA KHAN,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
506,KUBLA KHAN,
507,KUBLA KHAN,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
508,KUBLA KHAN,Floated midway on the waves;
509,KUBLA KHAN,Where was heard the mingled measure
510,KUBLA KHAN,From the fountain and the caves.
511,KUBLA KHAN,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
512,KUBLA KHAN,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
513,KUBLA KHAN,A damsel with a dulcimer
514,KUBLA KHAN,In a vision once I saw:
515,KUBLA KHAN,"It was an Abyssinian maid,"
516,KUBLA KHAN,"And on her dulcimer she played,"
517,KUBLA KHAN,Singing of Mount Abora.
518,KUBLA KHAN,Could I revive within me
519,KUBLA KHAN,"Her symphony and song,"
520,KUBLA KHAN,To such a deep delight ’twould win me
521,KUBLA KHAN,"That with music loud and long,"
522,KUBLA KHAN,"I would build that dome in air,"
523,KUBLA KHAN,That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!
524,KUBLA KHAN,And all who heard should see them there
525,KUBLA KHAN,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
526,KUBLA KHAN,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
527,KUBLA KHAN,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
528,KUBLA KHAN,And close your eyes with holy dread
529,KUBLA KHAN,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"
530,KUBLA KHAN,And drunk the milk of Paradise.

548,MEG MERRILIES,
549,MEG MERRILIES,"Her apples were swart blackberries,"
550,MEG MERRILIES,Her currants pods o’ broom;
551,MEG MERRILIES,"Her wine was dew of the wild white rose,"

553,MEG MERRILIES,
554,MEG MERRILIES,"Her Brothers were the craggy hills,"

558,MEG MERRILIES,
559,MEG MERRILIES,"No breakfast had she many a morn,"
560,MEG MERRILIES,"No dinner many a noon,"
561,MEG MERRILIES,And ’stead of supper she would stare
562,MEG MERRILIES,Full hard against the Moon.
563,MEG MERRILIES,

565,MEG MERRILIES,"She made her garlanding,"

570,MEG MERRILIES,"She plaited Mats o’ Rushes,"

572,MEG MERRILIES,She met among the Bushes.

589,BERRIES,There was an old woman
590,BERRIES,Went blackberry picking
591,BERRIES,Along the hedges
592,BERRIES,From Weep to Wicking.
593,BERRIES,Half a pottle--
594,BERRIES,"No more she had got,"
595,BERRIES,When out steps a Fairy
596,BERRIES,From her green grot;
597,BERRIES,"And says, “Well, Jill,"
598,BERRIES,Would ’ee pick ’ee mo?”
599,BERRIES,"And Jill, she curtseys,"
600,BERRIES,And looks just so.
601,BERRIES,"“Be off,” says the Fairy,"
602,BERRIES,"“As quick as you can,"
603,BERRIES,Over the meadows
604,BERRIES,"To the little green lane,"
605,BERRIES,That dips to the hayfields
606,BERRIES,Of Farmer Grimes:
607,BERRIES,I’ve berried those hedges
608,BERRIES,A score of times;
609,BERRIES,Bushel on bushel
610,BERRIES,"I’ll promise ’ee, Jill,"
611,BERRIES,This side of supper
612,BERRIES,If ’ee pick with a will.”
613,BERRIES,"She glints very bright,"
614,BERRIES,And speaks her fair;
615,BERRIES,"Then lo, and behold!"
616,BERRIES,She has faded in air.
617,BERRIES,
618,BERRIES,Be sure old Goodie
619,BERRIES,She trots betimes
620,BERRIES,Over the meadows
621,BERRIES,To Farmer Grimes.
622,BERRIES,And never was queen
623,BERRIES,With jewellery rich
624,BERRIES,As those same hedges
625,BERRIES,From twig to ditch;
626,BERRIES,"Like Dutchmen’s coffers,"
627,BERRIES,"Fruit, thorn, and flower--"
628,BERRIES,They shone like William
629,BERRIES,And Mary’s bower.
630,BERRIES,And be sure Old Goodie
631,BERRIES,"Went back to Weep,"
632,BERRIES,So tired with her basket
633,BERRIES,She scarce could creep.
634,BERRIES,When she comes in the dusk
635,BERRIES,"To her cottage door,"
636,BERRIES,There’s Towser wagging
637,BERRIES,"As never before,"
638,BERRIES,To see his Missus
639,BERRIES,So glad to be
640,BERRIES,Come from her fruit-picking
641,BERRIES,Back to he.

645,BERRIES,And soon as next morning
646,BERRIES,"Dawn was grey,"
647,BERRIES,The pot on the hob
648,BERRIES,Was simmering away;
649,BERRIES,And all in a stew
650,BERRIES,And a hugger-mugger
651,BERRIES,Towser and Jill
652,BERRIES,"A-boiling of sugar,"
653,BERRIES,And the dark clear fruit
654,BERRIES,"That from Faërie came,"
655,BERRIES,For syrup and jelly
656,BERRIES,And blackberry jam.
657,BERRIES,
658,BERRIES,Twelve jolly gallipots
659,BERRIES,Jill put by;
660,BERRIES,"And one little teeny one,"
661,BERRIES,One inch high;
662,BERRIES,And that she’s hidden
663,BERRIES,"A good thumb deep,"

1179,PART III,"A mighty silver bugle hung,"
1180,PART III,"And as he rode his armor rung,"
1181,PART III,Beside remote Shalott.
1182,PART III,
1183,PART III,All in the blue unclouded weather
1184,PART III,"Thick-jeweled shone the saddle-leather,"
1185,PART III,The helmet and the helmet-feather
1186,PART III,"Burned like one burning flame together,"
1187,PART III,As he rode down to Camelot;
1188,PART III,"As often through the purple night,"
1189,PART III,"Below the starry clusters bright,"
1190,PART III,"Some bearded meteor, trailing light,"
1191,PART III,Moves over still Shalott.
1192,PART III,
1193,PART III,His broad clear brow in sunlight glowed;
1194,PART III,On burnished hooves his war-horse trode;
1195,PART III,From underneath his helmet flowed
1196,PART III,"His coal-black curls as on he rode,"
1197,PART III,As he rode down to Camelot.
1198,PART III,From the bank and from the river
1199,PART III,"He flashed into the crystal mirror,"
1200,PART III,"“Tirra lirra,” by the river"
1201,PART III,Sang Sir Lancelot.
1202,PART III,
1203,PART III,"She left the web, she left the loom,"
1204,PART III,"She made three paces through the room,"
1205,PART III,"She saw the water-lily bloom,"
1206,PART III,"She saw the helmet and the plume,"
1207,PART III,She looked down to Camelot.
1208,PART III,Out flew the web and floated wide;
1209,PART III,The mirror cracked from side to side;
1210,PART III,“The curse is come upon me!” cried
1211,PART III,The Lady of Shalott.

1219,PART IV,"The pale yellow woods were waning,"
1220,PART IV,"The broad stream in his banks complaining,"
1221,PART IV,Heavily the low sky raining
1222,PART IV,Over towered Camelot;
1223,PART IV,Down she came and found a boat
1224,PART IV,"Beneath a willow left afloat,"
1225,PART IV,And round about the prow she wrote
1226,PART IV,_The Lady of Shalott_.
1227,PART IV,
1228,PART IV,And down the river’s dim expanse--
1229,PART IV,"Like some bold seër in a trance,"
1230,PART IV,Seeing all his own mischance--
1231,PART IV,With a glassy countenance
1232,PART IV,Did she look to Camelot.
1233,PART IV,And at the closing of the day
1234,PART IV,"She loosed the chain, and down she lay;"
1235,PART IV,"The broad stream bore her far away,"
1236,PART IV,The Lady of Shalott.
1237,PART IV,
1238,PART IV,"Lying, robed in snowy white"
1239,PART IV,That loosely flew to left and right--
1240,PART IV,The leaves upon her falling light--
1241,PART IV,Through the noises of the night
1242,PART IV,She floated down to Camelot:
1243,PART IV,And as the boat-head wound along
1244,PART IV,"The willowy hills and fields among,"
1245,PART IV,"They heard her singing her last song,"
1246,PART IV,The Lady of Shalott.
1247,PART IV,
1248,PART IV,"Heard a carol, mournful, holy,"
1249,PART IV,"Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,"
1250,PART IV,"Till her blood was frozen slowly,"
1251,PART IV,"And her eyes were darkened wholly,"
1252,PART IV,Turned to towered Camelot;
1253,PART IV,For ere she reached upon the tide
1254,PART IV,"The first house by the water-side,"
1255,PART IV,"Singing in her song she died,"
1256,PART IV,The Lady of Shalott.
1257,PART IV,
1258,PART IV,"Under tower and balcony,"
1259,PART IV,"By garden-wall and gallery,"
1260,PART IV,"A gleaming shape she floated by,"
1261,PART IV,"Dead-pale between the houses high,"
1262,PART IV,Silent into Camelot.
1263,PART IV,"Out upon the wharfs they came,"
1264,PART IV,"Knight and burgher, lord and dame,"
1265,PART IV,"And round the prow they read her name,"
1266,PART IV,_The Lady of Shalott_.
1267,PART IV,
1268,PART IV,Who is this? and what is here?
1269,PART IV,And in the lighted palace near
1270,PART IV,Died the sound of royal cheer;
1271,PART IV,"And they crossed themselves for fear,"
1272,PART IV,All the knights at Camelot:
1273,PART IV,But Lancelot mused a little space;
1274,PART IV,"He said, “She has a lovely face;"
1275,PART IV,"God in His mercy lend her grace,"
1276,PART IV,The Lady of Shalott.”

1408,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Bold Robin in forrest did spy
1409,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"A jolly butcher, with a bonny fine mare,"
1410,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,With his flesh to the market did hye.
1411,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1412,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Good morrow, good fellow,’ said jolly Robin,"
1413,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘What food hast? tell unto me;
1414,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"And thy trade to me tell, and where thou dost dwell,"
1415,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,For I like well thy company.’
1416,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1417,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,The butcher he answered jolly Robin:
1418,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘No matter where I dwell;
1419,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"For a butcher I am, and to Notingham"
1420,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"I am going, my flesh to sell.’"
1421,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1422,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘What is the price of thy flesh?’ said jolly Robin,"
1423,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘Come tell it soon unto me;
1424,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"And the price of thy mare, be she never so dear,"
1425,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,For a butcher fain would I be.’

1439,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"With good intent, to the sheriff he went,"
1440,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And there he took up his inn.
1441,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1442,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"When other butchers they opened their meat,"
1443,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Bold Robin he then begun;
1444,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"But how for to sell he knew not well,"
1445,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,For a butcher he was but young.
1446,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1447,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"When other butchers no meat could sell,"
1448,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Robin got both gold and fee;
1449,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,For he sold more meat for one peny
1450,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Than others could do for three.
1451,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1452,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"But when he sold his meat so fast,"
1453,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,No butcher by him could thrive;
1454,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,For he sold more meat for one peny
1455,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Than others could do for five.
1456,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1457,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Which made the butchers of Notingham
1458,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"To study as they did stand,"
1459,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"Saying, surely he was some prodigal,"
1460,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,That had sold his father’s land.
1461,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1462,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"The butchers they stepped to jolly Robin,"
1463,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Acquainted with him for to be;
1464,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Come, brother,’ one said, ‘we be all of one trade,"
1465,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"Come, will you go dine with me?’"
1466,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1467,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Accurst of his heart,’ said jolly Robin,"
1468,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘That a butcher doth deny;
1469,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"I will go with you my brethren true,"
1470,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And as fast as I can hie.’
1471,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1472,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"But when to the sheriff’s house they came,"
1473,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"To dinner they hied apace,"
1474,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And Robin he the man must be
1475,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Before them all to say grace.
1476,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1477,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Pray God bless us all,’ said jolly Robin,"
1478,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘And our meat within this place;
1479,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"A cup of sack so good will nourish our blood,"
1480,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And so I do end my grace.
1481,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1482,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Come fill us more wine,’ said jolly Robin,"
1483,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘Let us merry be while we do stay;
1484,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"For wine and good cheer, be it never so dear,"
1485,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,I vow I the reckning will pay.
1486,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1487,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Come, brothers, be merry,’ said jolly Robin,"
1488,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Let us drink, and never give ore;"
1489,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"For the shot I will pay, ere I go my way,"
1490,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,If it cost me five pounds and more.’
1491,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1492,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘This is a mad blade,’ the butchers then said;"
1493,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"Saies the sheriff, ‘He is some prodigal,"
1494,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"That some land has sold, for silver and gold,"
1495,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And now he doth mean to spend all.
1496,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1497,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Hast thou any horn-beasts,’ the sheriff repli’d,"
1498,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Good fellow, to sell unto me?’"
1499,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘Yes, that I have, good Master Sheriff,"
1500,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,I have hundreds two or three.
1501,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1502,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘And a hundred aker of good free land,"
1503,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,If you please it to see;
1504,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And I’le make you as good assurance of it
1505,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,As ever my father made me.’
1506,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1507,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"The sheriff he saddled a good palfrey,"
1508,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"With three hundred pound in gold,"
1509,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"And away he went with bold Robin Hood,"
1510,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,His horned beasts to behold.
1511,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1512,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"Away then the sheriff and Robin did ride,"
1513,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,To the forrest of merry Sherwood;
1514,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"Then the sheriff did say, ‘God bless us this day"
1515,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,From a man they call Robin Hood!’
1516,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1517,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"But when that a little further they came,"
1518,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Bold Robin he chanced to spy
1519,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"A hundred head of good red deer,"
1520,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,Come tripping the sheriff full nigh.
1521,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1522,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘How like you my hornd beasts, good Master Sheriff?"
1523,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,They be fat and fair for to see:’
1524,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘I tell thee, good fellow, I would I were gone,"
1525,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,For I like not thy company.’
1526,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1527,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"Then Robin he set his horn to his mouth,"
1528,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And blew but blasts three;
1529,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"Then quickly anon there came Little John,"
1530,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And all his company.
1531,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1532,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘What is your will?’ then said little John,"
1533,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘Good master come tell it to me;’
1534,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘I have brought hither the sheriff of Notingham,"
1535,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,This day to dine with thee.’
1536,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1537,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"‘He is welcome to me,’ then said Little John,"
1538,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,‘I hope he will honestly pay;

1547,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,And out of the sheriffe’s portmantle
1548,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,He told three hundred pound.
1549,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,
1550,ROBIN HOOD AND THE BUTCHER,"The Robin he brought him thorow the wood,"

2003,IVRY,"And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine’s empurpled flood,"
2004,IVRY,And good Coligni’s hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;
2005,IVRY,"And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,"

2007,IVRY,
2008,IVRY,"The King is come to marshal us, in all his armor dressed;"

2047,IVRY,"For our God hath crushed the tyrant, our God hath raised the slave,"
2048,IVRY,"And mocked the counsel of the wise, and the valor of the brave."

2372,IV,Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!”

2377,V,"“Come in!” the Mayor cried, looking bigger:"
2378,V,And in did come the strangest figure!
2379,V,His queer long coat from heel to head
2380,V,"Was half of yellow and half of red,"
2381,V,"And he himself was tall and thin,"
2382,V,"With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,"
2383,V,"And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,"
2384,V,"No tuft on cheek, nor beard on chin,"
2385,V,But lips where smiles went out and in;
2386,V,There was no guessing his kith and kin:
2387,V,And nobody could enough admire
2388,V,The tall man and his quaint attire.
2389,V,"Quoth one: “It’s as my great-grandsire,"
2390,V,"Starting up at the Trump of Doom’s tone,"
2391,V,Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!”
2392,V,
2393,V,
2394,VI,VI
2395,VI,
2396,VI,He advanced to the council-table:
2397,VI,"And, “Please your honors,” said he, “I’m able,"
2398,VI,By means of a secret charm to draw
2399,VI,"All creatures living beneath the sun,"
2400,VI,"That creep or swim or fly or run,"
2401,VI,After me so as you never saw!
2402,VI,And I chiefly use my charm
2403,VI,"On creatures that do people harm,"
2404,VI,The mole and toad and newt and viper;
2405,VI,And people call me the Pied Piper.”
2406,VI,(And here they noticed round his neck
2407,VI,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"
2408,VI,"To match with his coat of the self-same check,"
2409,VI,And at the scarf’s end hung a pipe;
2410,VI,"And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying"
2411,VI,As if impatient to be playing
2412,VI,Upon this pipe as low it dangled
2413,VI,Over his vesture so old-fangled.)
2414,VI,"“Yet,” said he, “poor piper as I am,"
2415,VI,"In Tartary I freed the Cham,"
2416,VI,"Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;"
2417,VI,I eased in Asia the Nizam
2418,VI,Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats;
2419,VI,"And as for what your brain bewilders,--"
2420,VI,"If I can rid your town of rats,"
2421,VI,Will you give me a thousand guilders?”
2422,VI,“One? fifty thousand!” was the exclamation
2423,VI,Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.

2430,VII,"Into the street the Piper stepped,"
2431,VII,"Smiling first a little smile,"
2432,VII,As if he knew what magic slept
2433,VII,In his quiet pipe the while;
2434,VII,"Then, like a musical adept,"
2435,VII,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
2436,VII,"And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,"
2437,VII,Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
2438,VII,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,"
2439,VII,You heard as if an army muttered;
2440,VII,And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
2441,VII,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
2442,VII,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
2443,VII,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"
2444,VII,"Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,"
2445,VII,"Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,"
2446,VII,"Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,"
2447,VII,Cocking tails and pricking whiskers;
2448,VII,"Families by tens and dozens,"
2449,VII,"Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives,--"
2450,VII,Followed the Piper for their lives.
2451,VII,"From street to street he piped advancing,"
2452,VII,"And step for step they followed dancing,"
2453,VII,"Until they came to the river Weser,"
2454,VII,Wherein all plunged and perished!
2455,VII,"--Save one who, stout as Julius Caesar,"
2456,VII,Swam across and lived to carry
2457,VII,"(As he, the manuscript he cherished)"
2458,VII,"To Rat-land home his commentary,"
2459,VII,"Which was: “At the first shrill notes of the pipe,"
2460,VII,"I heard the sound as of scraping tripe,"
2461,VII,"And putting apples, wondrous ripe,"
2462,VII,"Into a cider-press’s gripe,--"
2463,VII,"And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,"
2464,VII,"And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,"
2465,VII,"And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,"
2466,VII,And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks;
2467,VII,And it seemed as if a voice
2468,VII,(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery
2469,VII,"Is breathed) called out ‘Oh rats, rejoice!"
2470,VII,The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
2471,VII,"So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,"
2472,VII,"Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!’"
2473,VII,"And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,"
2474,VII,"Already staved, like a great sun shone"
2475,VII,"Glorious scarce an inch before me,"
2476,VII,"Just as methought it said, ‘Come, bore me!’--"
2477,VII,I found the Weser rolling o’er me.”

2485,VIII,Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple;
2486,VIII,"“Go,” cried the Mayor, “and get long poles!"
2487,VIII,Poke out the nests and block up the holes!
2488,VIII,"Consult with carpenters and builders,"
2489,VIII,And leave in our town not even a trace
2490,VIII,"Of the rats!”--when suddenly, up the face"
2491,VIII,"Of the Piper perked in the market-place,"
2492,VIII,"With a “First, if you please, my thousand guilders!”"

2497,IX,A thousand guilders! the Mayor looked blue;
2498,IX,So did the Corporation too.
2499,IX,For council-dinners made rare havoc
2500,IX,"With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;"
2501,IX,And half the money would replenish
2502,IX,Their cellar’s biggest butt with Rhenish.
2503,IX,To pay this sum to a wandering fellow
2504,IX,With a gypsy coat of red and yellow!
2505,IX,"“Beside,” quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,"
2506,IX,“Our business was done at the river’s brink;
2507,IX,"We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,"
2508,IX,"And what’s dead can’t come to life, I think."
2509,IX,"So, friend, we’re not the folks to shrink"
2510,IX,"From the duty of giving you something to drink,"
2511,IX,And a matter of money to put in your poke;
2512,IX,"But as for the guilders, what we spoke"
2513,IX,"Of them, as you very well know, was in joke."
2514,IX,"Beside, our losses have made us thrifty;"
2515,IX,"A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!”"

2522,X,I’ve promised to visit by dinner time
2523,X,"Bagdat, and accept the prime"
2524,X,"Of the Head Cook’s pottage, all he’s rich in,"
2525,X,"For having left, in the Caliph’s kitchen,"
2526,X,Of a nest of scorpions no survivor;
2527,X,With him I proved no bargain-driver;
2528,X,"With you, don’t think I’ll bate a stiver!"

2530,X,May find me pipe after another fashion.”

2538,XI,Being worse treated than a Cook?
2539,XI,Insulted by a lazy ribald
2540,XI,With idle pipe and vesture piebald?
2541,XI,"You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,"

2549,XII,Once more he stepped into the street;
2550,XII,And to his lips again
2551,XII,Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;
2552,XII,And ere he blew three notes (such sweet
2553,XII,Soft notes as jet musician’s cunning
2554,XII,Never gave the enraptured air)
2555,XII,There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
2556,XII,Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;
2557,XII,"Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,"
2558,XII,"Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering;"
2559,XII,"And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,"
2560,XII,Out came the children running:
2561,XII,"All the little boys and girls,"
2562,XII,"With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,"
2563,XII,"And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,"
2564,XII,"Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after"
2565,XII,The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.
2566,XII,
2567,XII,
2568,XIII,XIII
2569,XIII,
2570,XIII,"The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood"
2571,XIII,"As if they were changed into blocks of wood,"
2572,XIII,"Unable to move a step, or cry"
2573,XIII,"To the children merrily skipping by,--"
2574,XIII,And could only follow with the eye
2575,XIII,That joyous crowd at the Piper’s back.
2576,XIII,"But how the Mayor was on the rack,"
2577,XIII,"And the wretched Council’s bosoms beat,"
2578,XIII,As the Piper turned from the High Street
2579,XIII,To where the Weser rolled its waters
2580,XIII,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
2581,XIII,"However, he turned from south to west,"
2582,XIII,"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,"
2583,XIII,And after him the children pressed;
2584,XIII,Great was the joy in every breast.
2585,XIII,“He never can cross that mighty top!
2586,XIII,"He’s forced to let the piping drop,"
2587,XIII,And we shall see our children stop!”
2588,XIII,"When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,"
2589,XIII,"A wondrous portal opened wide,"
2590,XIII,As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
2591,XIII,And the Piper advanced and the children followed;
2592,XIII,"And when all were in, to the very last,"
2593,XIII,The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
2594,XIII,"Did I say, all? No! One was lame,"
2595,XIII,And could not dance the whole of the way;
2596,XIII,"And in after years, if you would blame"
2597,XIII,"His sadness, he was used to say,--"
2598,XIII,“It’s dull in our town since my playmates left!
2599,XIII,I can’t forget that I am bereft
2600,XIII,"Of all the pleasant sights they see,"
2601,XIII,Which the Piper also promised me;
2602,XIII,"For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,"
2603,XIII,"Joining the town and just at hand,"
2604,XIII,"Where waters gushed, and fruit-trees grew,"
2605,XIII,"And flowers put forth a fairer hue,"
2606,XIII,And everything was strange and new;
2607,XIII,"The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,"
2608,XIII,"And their dogs outran our fallow deer,"
2609,XIII,"And honey-bees had lost their stings,"
2610,XIII,And horses were born with eagles’ wings;
2611,XIII,And just as I became assured
2612,XIII,"My lame foot would be speedily cured,"
2613,XIII,"The music stopped and I stood still,"
2614,XIII,"And found myself outside the hill,"
2615,XIII,"Left alone against my will,"
2616,XIII,"To go now limping as before,"
2617,XIII,And never hear of that country more!”

2622,XIV,"Alas, alas for Hamelin!"
2623,XIV,There came into many a burgher’s pate

2625,XIV,Opes to the rich at as easy rate
2626,XIV,As the needle’s eye takes a camel in!
2627,XIV,"The Mayor sent East, West, North and South,"
2628,XIV,"To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,"
2629,XIV,"Wherever it was men’s lot to find him,"
2630,XIV,"Silver and gold to his heart’s content,"
2631,XIV,"If he’d only return the way he went,"
2632,XIV,And bring the children behind him.
2633,XIV,"But when they saw ’twas a lost endeavor,"
2634,XIV,"And piper and dancers were gone forever,"
2635,XIV,They made a decree that lawyers never
2636,XIV,Should think their records dated duly
2637,XIV,"If, after the day of the month and year,"
2638,XIV,"These words did not as well appear,"
2639,XIV,“And so long after what happened here
2640,XIV,"On the Twenty-second of July,"
2641,XIV,Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:”
2642,XIV,And the better in memory to fix
2643,XIV,"The place of the children’s last retreat,"
2644,XIV,"They called it, the Pied Piper Street--"
2645,XIV,Where any one playing on pipe or tabor
2646,XIV,Was sure for the future to lose his labor.
2647,XIV,Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
2648,XIV,To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
2649,XIV,But opposite the place of the cavern
2650,XIV,"They wrote the story on a column,"
2651,XIV,And on the great church-window painted
2652,XIV,"The same, to make the world acquainted"
2653,XIV,"How their children were stolen away,"
2654,XIV,And there it stands to this very day.
2655,XIV,And I must not omit to say
2656,XIV,That in Transylvania there’s a tribe
2657,XIV,Of alien people who ascribe
2658,XIV,The outlandish ways and dress
2659,XIV,"On which their neighbors lay such stress,"
2660,XIV,To their fathers and mothers having risen
2661,XIV,Out of some subterraneous prison
2662,XIV,Into which they were trepanned
2663,XIV,Long time ago in a mighty band
2664,XIV,"Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,"

2814,MY LOST YOUTH,"The drum-beat repeated o’er and o’er,"
2815,MY LOST YOUTH,And the bugle wild and shrill.
2816,MY LOST YOUTH,And the music of that old song
2817,MY LOST YOUTH,Throbs in my memory still:
2818,MY LOST YOUTH,"“A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
2819,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.”"
2820,MY LOST YOUTH,
2821,MY LOST YOUTH,"I remember the sea-fight far away,"
2822,MY LOST YOUTH,How it thundered o’er the tide!
2823,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the dead captains, as they lay"
2824,MY LOST YOUTH,"In their graves, o’erlooking the tranquil bay"
2825,MY LOST YOUTH,Where they in battle died.
2826,MY LOST YOUTH,And the sound of that mournful song
2827,MY LOST YOUTH,Goes through me with a thrill:
2828,MY LOST YOUTH,"“A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
2829,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.”"
2830,MY LOST YOUTH,
2831,MY LOST YOUTH,"I can see the breezy dome of groves,"
2832,MY LOST YOUTH,The shadows of Deering’s Woods;
2833,MY LOST YOUTH,And the friendships old and the early loves
2834,MY LOST YOUTH,"Come back with a Sabbath sound, as of doves"
2835,MY LOST YOUTH,In quiet neighborhoods.
2836,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the verse of that sweet old song,"
2837,MY LOST YOUTH,It flutters and murmurs still:
2838,MY LOST YOUTH,"“A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
2839,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.”"
2840,MY LOST YOUTH,
2841,MY LOST YOUTH,I remember the gleams and glooms that dart
2842,MY LOST YOUTH,Across the school-boy’s brain;
2843,MY LOST YOUTH,"The song and the silence in the heart,"
2844,MY LOST YOUTH,"That in part are prophecies, and in part"
2845,MY LOST YOUTH,Are longings wild and vain.
2846,MY LOST YOUTH,And the voice of that fitful song
2847,MY LOST YOUTH,"Sings on, and is never still:"
2848,MY LOST YOUTH,"“A boy’s will is the wind’s will,"
2849,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.”..."

3245,THE CLOUD,"Build up the blue dome of air,"
3246,THE CLOUD,"I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,"

3248,THE CLOUD,"Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,"
3249,THE CLOUD,I arise and unbuild it again.

3299,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
3300,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Call her once before you go.--
3301,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Call once yet!
3302,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,In a voice that she will know:
3303,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,“Margaret! Margaret!”
3304,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Children’s voices should be dear.
3305,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,(Call once more) to a mother’s ear;

3310,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"“Mother dear, we cannot stay!"

3316,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"One last look at the white-walled town,"

3318,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Then come down!

3321,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
3322,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Children dear, was it yesterday"
3323,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,We heard the sweet bells over the bay?
3324,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"In the caverns where we lay,"
3325,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Through the surf and through the swell,"
3326,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The far-off sound of a silver bell?
3327,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,"
3328,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Where the winds are all asleep;
3329,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the spent lights quiver and gleam,"
3330,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the salt weed sways in the stream,"
3331,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,"
3332,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;
3333,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,"
3334,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Dry their mail and bask in the brine;
3335,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where great whales come sailing by,"
3336,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Sail and sail, with unshut eye,"

3341,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Children dear, was it yesterday"
3342,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,(Call yet once) that she went away?
3343,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Once she sate with you and me,"
3344,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,"
3345,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And the youngest sate on her knee,"
3346,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She combed its bright hair, and she tended it well,"
3347,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When down swung the sound of the far-off bell.
3348,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She sighed, she looked up through the clear green sea;"
3349,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She said: “I must go, for my kinsfolk pray"
3350,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,In the little gray church on the shore to-day.
3351,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"’Twill be Easter-time in the world,--ah me!"
3352,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And I lose my poor soul, Merman, here with thee.”"
3353,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"I said: “Go up, dear heart, through the waves:"
3354,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!”"
3355,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay."

3358,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,[Illustration]
3359,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
3360,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Children dear, were we long alone?"
3361,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"“The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan;"
3362,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Long prayers,” I said, “in the world they say;"
3363,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come!” I said, and we rose through the surf in the bay."
3364,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We went up the beach, by the sandy down"
3365,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-walled town,"
3366,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,"
3367,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,To the little gray church on the windy hill.
3368,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,"
3369,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.
3370,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
3371,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We climbed on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,"
3372,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.
3373,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:
3374,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"“Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!"
3375,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Dear heart,” I said, “we are long alone;"
3376,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.”"
3377,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"But, ah, she gave me never a look,"
3378,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,For her eyes were sealed to the holy book!
3379,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.
3380,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come away, children, call no more!"
3381,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come away, come down, call no more!"
3382,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
3383,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Down, down, down!"
3384,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Down to the depths of the sea!
3385,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She sits at her wheel in the humming town,"
3386,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Singing most joyfully.
3387,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Hark what she sings: “O joy, O joy,"
3388,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"For the humming street, and the child with its toy!"
3389,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"For the priest and the bell, and the holy well;"
3390,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"For the wheel where I spun,"
3391,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And the blessed light of the sun!”
3392,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And so she sings her fill,"
3393,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Singing most joyfully,"
3394,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Till the spindle drops from her hand,"
3395,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And the whizzing wheel stands still.
3396,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,"
3397,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And over the sand at the sea;
3398,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And her eyes are set in a stare,"
3399,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And anon there breaks a sigh,"
3400,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And anon there drops a tear,"
3401,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"From a sorrow-clouded eye,"
3402,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And a heart sorrow-laden,"
3403,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"A long, long sigh;"
3404,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden,"
3405,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And the gleam of her golden hair.
3406,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
3407,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come away, away, children;"
3408,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come, children, come down!"
3409,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The hoarse wind blows coldly;
3410,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Lights shine in the town.
3411,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,She will start from her slumber
3412,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When gusts shake the door;
3413,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She will hear the winds howling,"
3414,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Will hear the waves roar.
3415,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We shall see, while above us"
3416,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"The waves roar and whirl,"
3417,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"A ceiling of amber,"
3418,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,A pavement of pearl
3419,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Singing: “Here came a mortal,"
3420,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,But faithless was she!
3421,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And alone dwell for ever
3422,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The kings of the sea.”
3423,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"But, children, at midnight,"
3424,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"When soft the winds blow,"
3425,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"When clear falls the moonlight,"
3426,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When spring-tides are low;
3427,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When sweet airs come seaward
3428,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"From heaths starred with broom,"
3429,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And high rocks throw mildly
3430,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,On the blanched sands a gloom;
3431,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Up the still, glistening beaches,"
3432,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Up the creeks we will hie;
3433,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Over banks of bright seaweed
3434,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The ebb-tide leaves dry.
3435,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We will gaze, from the sand-hills,"
3436,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"At the white, sleeping town;"
3437,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,At the church on the hillside--
3438,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And then come back down.
3439,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Singing: “There dwells a loved one,"

3441,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,She left lonely for ever

3684,LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI,
3685,LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI,And this is why I sojourn here

3687,LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI,"Though the sedge is withered from the lake,"
3688,LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI,And no birds sing.

4035,MOON FOLLY,"Like a great pale apple of silver and pearl,"
4036,MOON FOLLY,Like a great pale apple is she.
4037,MOON FOLLY,
4038,MOON FOLLY,I will leap and will catch her with quick cold hands
4039,MOON FOLLY,And carry her home in my sack.
4040,MOON FOLLY,I will set her down safe on the oaken bench
4041,MOON FOLLY,That stands at the chimney-back.
4042,MOON FOLLY,
4043,MOON FOLLY,"And then I will sit by the fire all night,"
4044,MOON FOLLY,And sit by the fire all day.
4045,MOON FOLLY,I will gnaw at the Moon to my heart’s delight
4046,MOON FOLLY,Till I gnaw her slowly away.
4047,MOON FOLLY,
4048,MOON FOLLY,And while I grow mad with the Moon’s cold taste
4049,MOON FOLLY,"The World will beat at my door,"
4050,MOON FOLLY,"Crying “Come out!” and crying “Make haste,"
4051,MOON FOLLY,And give us the Moon once more!”
4052,MOON FOLLY,
4053,MOON FOLLY,But I shall not answer them ever at all.
4054,MOON FOLLY,"I shall laugh, as I count and hide"
4055,MOON FOLLY,The great black beautiful Seeds of the Moon
4056,MOON FOLLY,In a flower-pot deep and wide.
4057,MOON FOLLY,
4058,MOON FOLLY,"Then I shall lie down and go fast asleep,"
4059,MOON FOLLY,Drunken with flame and aswoon.
4060,MOON FOLLY,"But the seeds will sprout and the seeds will leap,"
4061,MOON FOLLY,The subtle swift seeds of the Moon.
4062,MOON FOLLY,
4063,MOON FOLLY,"And some day, all of the World that cries"
4064,MOON FOLLY,And beats at my door shall see
4065,MOON FOLLY,A thousand moon-leaves spring from my thatch
4066,MOON FOLLY,On a wonderful white Moon-tree!
4067,MOON FOLLY,
4068,MOON FOLLY,Then each shall have Moons to his heart’s desire:
4069,MOON FOLLY,Apples of silver and pearl;
4070,MOON FOLLY,Apples of orange and copper fire
4071,MOON FOLLY,Setting his five wits aswirl!
4072,MOON FOLLY,
4073,MOON FOLLY,"And then they will thank me, who mock me now,"
4074,MOON FOLLY,"“Wanting the Moon is he,”--"
4075,MOON FOLLY,"Oh, I’m off to the mountain after the Moon,"
4076,MOON FOLLY,Ere she falls from the dead fir-tree!

4281,THE GHOSTS OF THE BUFFALOES,"The locust played on his musical wing,"
4282,THE GHOSTS OF THE BUFFALOES,Sang to his mate of love’s delight.
4283,THE GHOSTS OF THE BUFFALOES,I heard the whippoorwill’s soft fret.

5263,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5264,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5265,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"O, young Lochinvar is come out of the West!"
5266,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;
5267,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"And save his good broadsword, he weapons had none;"
5268,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"He rode all unarm’d, and he rode all alone."
5269,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,"
5270,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
5271,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5272,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,He stay’d not for brake and he stopp’d not for stone;
5273,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;
5274,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,"
5275,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"The bride had consented, the gallant came late;"
5276,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,"
5277,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
5278,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5279,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"So boldly he enter’d the Netherby Hall,"
5280,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all;--"
5281,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword"
5282,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word),"
5283,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"‘O, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,"
5284,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?’"
5285,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5286,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"‘I long woo’d your daughter, my suit you denied;--"
5287,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide;--"
5288,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,And now I am come with this lost Love of mine
5289,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine."
5290,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,"
5291,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar!’
5292,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5293,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"The bride kiss’d the goblet: the knight took it up,"
5294,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,He quaff’d off the wine and he threw down the cup.
5295,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"She look’d down to blush, and she look’d up to sigh,"
5296,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye."
5297,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,--"
5298,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,‘Now tread we a measure!’ said young Lochinvar.
5299,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5300,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"So stately his form and so lovely her face,"
5301,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,That never a hall such a galliard did grace;
5302,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,"
5303,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
5304,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"And the bride-maidens whispered, ‘’Twere better by far,"
5305,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,To have match’d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar!’
5306,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5307,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,"
5308,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"When they reach’d the hall door, and the charger stood near;"
5309,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,"
5310,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
5311,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"‘She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;"
5312,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"They’ll have fleet steeds that follow,’ quoth young Lochinvar."
5313,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,
5314,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"There was mounting ’mong Graemes of the Netherby clan,"
5315,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran,"
5316,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"There was racing and chasing, on Cannobie lea,"
5317,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see.
5318,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,"So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,"
5319,YOUNG LOCHINVAR,Have ye e’er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?
