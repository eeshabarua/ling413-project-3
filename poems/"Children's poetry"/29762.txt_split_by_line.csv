94,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
95,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
96,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,There was once a boy named Nathan Green.
97,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,He was never rude and never mean.
98,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"But everyone was scared of him,"
99,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"Nancy, Dennis, Tom and Tim."
100,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
101,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"Nick and Susan, Mike and James,"
102,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Never let him play their games.
103,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"He knew why, but didn't say."
104,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,His mom said he was born that way.
105,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
106,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Nathan's hands aren't hands at all.
107,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,They're bigger than a basketball.
108,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"They're covered brown by furry hair,"
109,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Just like paws on any bear.
110,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
111,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Nathan hated both his paws.
112,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,He never used their mighty claws.
113,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,It's also hard to make a friend
114,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,When there's a tail on your rear end.
115,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
116,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,It's black and white and wags around.
117,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"When it swats, you hear a sound."
118,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"His mom said, ""Never be ashamed"","
119,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"But classmates said, ""He should be tamed!"""
120,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
121,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"He taped his tail down everyday,"
122,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,But still they wouldn't let him play.
123,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""He can't join; he'll pop the ball!"""
124,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,So recess wasn't fun at all.
125,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
126,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,He wished his tail were off his rear.
127,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,He wished his paws would disappear.
128,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
129,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,But then one day...
130,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
131,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,In class he learned about a creature.
132,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""It's very special,"" said his teacher."
133,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""Tail of a beaver, bill of a duck,"
134,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"Feet of an otter, just his luck!"""
135,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
136,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""He needs them all to stay alive,"
137,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"They're each a gift to help him survive."""
138,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""What is it?"" called out Nathan loudly."
139,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""A PLATYPUS!"" said teacher proudly."
140,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
141,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Nathan couldn't help but smile.
142,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"All this time, all the while,"
143,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,He had never seen the truth--
144,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,His paws and tail must have a use!
145,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
146,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"From that day on, he changed his ways."
147,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,No one's scared of him these days.
148,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"His tail is wagging when he sits,"
149,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,His paws are helpful baseball mitts.
150,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
151,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Kids love to see him open drinks.
152,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"They like the splashing, Nathan thinks."
153,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"His tail, in summer, keeps him cool."
154,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,His friends crowd round when he's at school.
155,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
156,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,His newest classmate wants to meet him.
157,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Nathan wonders how she'll treat him.
158,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"Teacher makes the class grow quiet,"
159,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""No one speak, don't even try it."""
160,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
161,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"""There's someone here you all should meet."
162,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,"This is Martha Hippofeet."""
163,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
164,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,Nathan likes her.
165,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,
166,BEARPAWS NATHAN ZEBRATAIL,

181,BILLY SITS HERE!,"""I'll finish this later when we're all back from eating."

183,BILLY SITS HERE!,
184,BILLY SITS HERE!,He sneaks and he creeps to her new seating chart.
185,BILLY SITS HERE!,"She wrote it in pencil, a very good start!"
186,BILLY SITS HERE!,"He grabs the eraser and scratches his head,"
187,BILLY SITS HERE!,"""She's nuts if she thinks that I'll sit next to Fred!"""
188,BILLY SITS HERE!,
189,BILLY SITS HERE!,"He switches with Kathy, next to the door."
190,BILLY SITS HERE!,"Class can be fun, but he likes leaving more."

192,BILLY SITS HERE!,"If we mess around, there's no way she can see."""
193,BILLY SITS HERE!,

203,BILLY SITS HERE!,
204,BILLY SITS HERE!,"""There's no switching Walter--she'll notice a change."

206,BILLY SITS HERE!,"Lucas makes jokes so I'll put him close by,"

214,BILLY SITS HERE!,"""The Hellerman twins go next to each other--"
215,BILLY SITS HERE!,It's written in stone by their father and mother.

217,BILLY SITS HERE!,"Last thing I'll do is switch Hope with Willy."""
218,BILLY SITS HERE!,

220,BILLY SITS HERE!,They all shuffle in from the afternoon lunch.
221,BILLY SITS HERE!,Miss McClaire tells the class something he can't believe.
222,BILLY SITS HERE!,He muffles his shouting and bites on his sleeve.

327,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
328,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
329,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"(Inspired by ""A Visit from St. Nicholas"" by Clement Moore)"
330,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
331,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
332,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,'Twas the night before Christmas upon the North Pole.
333,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"Not a creature was sleeping, not one single soul."
334,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
335,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"All the elves were done working, now cozy in bed,"
336,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,While Christmas Eve jitters danced around in their head.
337,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
338,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,Did they make enough gifts for the good girls and boys?
339,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,Would the children wake up to find half-broken toys?
340,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
341,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"Then from the shop, they all heard a great BANG!"
342,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,And the high-tech security elf alarm rang.
343,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
344,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,They put on their shoes and ran down in a flash
345,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,To make sure some thief wasn't after their stash.
346,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
347,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"When they turned on the lights, can you guess who appeared?"
348,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,It was jolly St. Nick with his white fuzzy beard.
349,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
350,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"""Santa!"" they yelled, ""We're surprised that you're back."
351,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"Did your suit rip again? Do you need a new sack?"""
352,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
353,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"He said, ""Comet is tired, so are Vixen and Prancer,"
354,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"And Cupid is mad at both Blitzen and Dancer."""
355,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
356,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"""Dasher and Donder have just run away--"
357,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"I can't do my job if they don't pull my sleigh."""
358,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
359,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"""Go up on the roof and help save Christmas Day!"""
360,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"The elves did just that, without one word to say."
361,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
362,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"But a reindeer dilemma is not what they found,"
363,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"From Cupid to Comet, they were all safe and sound."
364,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
365,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"They saw Christmas trees and stockings galore,"
366,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"And enough milk and cookies, that they'd never need more."
367,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
368,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"With no explanation and without a goodbye,"
369,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,Santa hopped on his sleigh and started to fly.
370,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
371,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"So there they all were, on the roof by themselves,"
372,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"When they noticed a sign that read, ""WE LOVE THE ELVES!"""
373,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
374,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,And children popped up from behind rows of trees.
375,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"They were hiding all over, behind tables and wreathes."
376,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
377,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,They circled the elves as they started to cheer
378,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,So loudly that elves at the South Pole could hear!
379,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
380,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"And under the tree, which was grandest of all,"
381,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"Presents were waiting, some large and some small,"
382,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
383,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"Some wrapped with bows, some with bells that would jingle,"
384,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,But each with a note that was signed by Kris Kringle.
385,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
386,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"All the elves got a gift, and they liked every one."
387,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,Just a few trades were made before gifting was done.
388,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
389,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"By the end, they were speechless with such gratitude."
390,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"(And elves always talk, unless chewing their food.)"
391,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
392,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"It was time to turn in, for the younger elves' sake."
393,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,They'd be working tomorrow (enough of this break).
394,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
395,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"And as he lay down to sleep, filled with holiday spirit,"
396,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"A little elf spoke, but it was quite hard to hear it."
397,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,
398,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"He whispered the words with a childish delight,"
399,CHRISTMAS EVE UPON THE NORTH POLE,"""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight..."""

409,CLOUDPLAY,"Everyday nightly, the clouds get together."
410,CLOUDPLAY,They all float with ease since they're light as a feather.
411,CLOUDPLAY,
412,CLOUDPLAY,"They form into shapes, like a man molding clay,"
413,CLOUDPLAY,And they laugh at each other because that's how they play.
414,CLOUDPLAY,
415,CLOUDPLAY,"The wind swirls around and it sets them off spinning,"
416,CLOUDPLAY,"While the moon keeps an eye on them, constantly grinning."
417,CLOUDPLAY,
418,CLOUDPLAY,"And the stars start to twinkle and whistle a tune,"
419,CLOUDPLAY,Which never gets old for the ocean and moon.
420,CLOUDPLAY,
421,CLOUDPLAY,"The waves applaud loudly by crashing the shore,"
422,CLOUDPLAY,While the trees grow up higher to listen some more.
423,CLOUDPLAY,
424,CLOUDPLAY,"If you wander outside and you look up by chance,"
425,CLOUDPLAY,You may catch the clouds in the midst of their dance.
426,CLOUDPLAY,
427,CLOUDPLAY,"But you have to be quick because clouds move along,"
428,CLOUDPLAY,And they float through the sky at the end of the song.
429,CLOUDPLAY,
430,CLOUDPLAY,"They drift all directions, this way and that,"
431,CLOUDPLAY,"The fluffy clouds, droopy clouds, skinny and fat."

455,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
456,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,There once lived a brave knight who was always saving princesses.
457,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,One day he rode by a tower with a princess inside and a horrible
458,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,dragon nearby. The knight charged at the dragon and drove him off.
459,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"Victorious, he burst through the tower door and found the princess."
460,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
461,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""I am here to save you!"" said the brave knight."
462,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
463,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""Save me from what?"" asked the princess, looking angrily at her"
464,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,broken door.
465,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
466,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""Why, the horrible dragon that I chased away, of course,"" said the"
467,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,brave knight.
468,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
469,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""That dragon was my pet and there's nothing horrible about him!"" she"
470,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"yelled. ""You'd better get him back or you'll never be a knight"
471,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"again,"" she said (and she meant it)."
472,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
473,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,The brave knight left right away to find the dragon that he was no
474,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,longer allowed to call horrible. The dragon was already miles away
475,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,because dragons fly quickly after a knight charges at them. It took
476,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,the knight days to find the dragon who was resting in a cave. The
477,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,brave knight crept up on the beast as he slept.
478,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
479,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,The dragon was having such a wonderful dream that fire came shooting
480,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"out of his nose. (You see, dragons breathe fire when they are scared"
481,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"and angry, but also when they are very happy.) The fire made the"
482,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"brave knight's armor extremely hot, so he started removing it until"
483,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,he was wearing only the raggedy clothes underneath. He took his
484,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,armor and horse outside before waking the dragon.
485,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
486,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""Excuse me,"" said the knight to the dragon."
487,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
488,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""Mmmrph,"" said the dragon. ""I've been chased from my home by a"
489,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"horrible knight. Leave me alone!"""
490,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
491,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""That's awful,"" said the brave knight, realizing that the dragon did"
492,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"not recognize him, ""but maybe it was just a mistake. What if the"
493,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"knight is not so horrible after all?"""
494,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
495,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""He is the most horrible knight ever!"" answered the dragon. ""I hope"
496,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"I never see him again."""
497,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
498,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""If you take me to your home, I will talk to him for you and sort"
499,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"all of this out,"" said the knight."
500,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
501,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"Before they left, the knight snuck outside, set his armor on the"
502,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"horse, and told it to ride back to the tower. Riding on top of the"
503,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"dragon, it did not take long for the knight to find the princess's"
504,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,tower.
505,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
506,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""I don't see him,"" said the knight, ""where is the horrible knight?"""
507,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
508,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""I don't know,"" said the dragon."
509,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
510,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"After a few short hours of looking for the knight, they saw a horse"
511,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"who came riding up to them, carrying shiny armor on his back (horses"
512,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,are much faster without knights riding on them).
513,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
514,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""That is the horse and that is the armor of the horrible knight,"""
515,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,said the dragon.
516,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
517,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""Oh no,"" said the knight, ""It looks like he is gone. A knight does"
518,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,not usually leave his horse or take off his armor. But what will
519,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,become of his kingdom? The townspeople will need a new knight to
520,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"fight for them."""
521,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
522,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""You could take over for him!"" said the dragon who was now so happy"
523,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,that fire shot out of his nose again.
524,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
525,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"So the knight put on the armor, and it fit extremely well. He hopped"
526,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,on the horse and rode it perfectly. The dragon was very impressed.
527,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"With the pet dragon now safely home, the brave knight went inside to"
528,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,tell the princess the good news.
529,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
530,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"""That's fantastic!"" said the princess, ""Now you have time to fix"
531,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"that door that you broke."""
532,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,
533,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"As the brave knight fixed the tower door, the dragon watched him and"
534,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,laid down for a nap. The dragon felt much better knowing that
535,DAMSEL IN A DRESS,"despite the same armor, this new knight was not so horrible."

700,I DON'T WANT A HAIRCUT,
701,I DON'T WANT A HAIRCUT,"For a while he loved his long hair. It grew past his eyes, and he"

705,I DON'T WANT A HAIRCUT,
706,I DON'T WANT A HAIRCUT,"But as his hair got longer, some things got harder. It was harder"

715,I DON'T WANT A HAIRCUT,"His hair grew past his shoulders, and Sammy didn't know what to do"

724,I DON'T WANT A HAIRCUT,
725,I DON'T WANT A HAIRCUT,"Sammy squeezed out the front door, and his hair followed behind. He"

816,JERRY'S BOX,curious too. She decided to send him to the principal for disturbing

842,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
843,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,Martin was hot as he sat by the shore.
844,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"They'd come for the ocean, but he liked the sand more."
845,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"""The water is fine, come on in!"" said his dad."
846,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"But the waves looked so big, that idea sounded bad."
847,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
848,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"His mother insisted, ""You should go in."""
849,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,No point in fighting--his mother would win.
850,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"She covered his face up with strong suntan lotion,"
851,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,Then they walked down to the edge of the ocean.
852,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
853,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"His pinky toe was first to enter,"
854,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"Then the big toe, front and center."
855,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"An hour later he was up to his knee,"
856,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"And he was turned round, so he didn't see..."
857,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
858,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"A monstrous wave came up from behind,"
859,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,It knocked off his suit (which was quite hard to find).
860,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"The wave knocked him down, and he cried for a while."
861,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,It was half a day later before he could smile.
862,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
863,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"""I'll never go back, not ever!"" he said."
864,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"""I'll stay in my room, under covers in bed."""
865,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"Martin was happy, that he'd arrived home,"
866,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,But that wave was special: it knew how to roam.
867,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
868,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,The wave was now hiding behind his oak tree.
869,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"When it peaked out at him, Martin could see."
870,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,He ran inside quickly and slammed his front door.
871,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,What would a wave want to follow him for?
872,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
873,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,The wave didn't leave--it was always around.
874,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,He could tell where it was by the swoosh-swooshing sound.
875,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"He heard it at dinner while eating some rice,"
876,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"But no one else could, he even asked twice!"
877,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
878,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,The wave followed close on his way back from school.
879,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"When someone was coming, it hid in a pool."
880,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"It was waiting outside while Martin was playing,"
881,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,Pretending to be water that the sprinkler was spraying.
882,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
883,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"By the end of the week, Martin was through."
884,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"He needed it gone, and he knew what to do."
885,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"He went to the ocean, on the very next day."
886,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,He turned to the wave and had something to say.
887,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
888,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"""I'm sick of you wave, now get back in there,"""
889,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,Being scared of this wave was too hard to bear.
890,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"He jumped in the water, the wave jumped in too,"
891,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"""Let's settle this now, just me and you!"""
892,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
893,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"The wave came up fast, but Martin was brave,"
894,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,He was no longer scared of this meddlesome wave.
895,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"With both arms stretched out, he rode the wave back."
896,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"It seemed that with swimming, he had a knack."
897,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,
898,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"For the rest of day, Martin had fun,"
899,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"With the water, the waves, the sand and the sun."
900,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"The wave didn't scare him, once he gave it a try,"
901,MARTIN AND THE WAVE,"And when he left the water, he waved it goodbye."

910,MICROBUG TUG,
911,MICROBUG TUG,Microbug Tug is small. He's smaller than a peanut. He's even smaller
912,MICROBUG TUG,than a crumb!
913,MICROBUG TUG,
914,MICROBUG TUG,"MicroBug Tug wants to go on a vacation, and he's visiting the human"
915,MICROBUG TUG,"body. The problem is, he doesn't know his way around too well, and"
916,MICROBUG TUG,he gets lost very easily.
917,MICROBUG TUG,
918,MICROBUG TUG,Can you help him figure out where he is?
919,MICROBUG TUG,
920,MICROBUG TUG,"Tug is in a deep cave. He's surrounded by two rows of white stumps,"
921,MICROBUG TUG,one row on top and one row on bottom. It looks like there's some
922,MICROBUG TUG,food caught between two of them. Do you know where he is?
923,MICROBUG TUG,
924,MICROBUG TUG,He's in the Mouth!
925,MICROBUG TUG,
926,MICROBUG TUG,"Well, that's not where he wants to be--he might get eaten! He moves"
927,MICROBUG TUG,on and now he's crawled inside a funny looking shape. Every sound is
928,MICROBUG TUG,louder inside. He can hear an echo as the sound bounces around and
929,MICROBUG TUG,"hits a ""drum."" Do you know where he is?"
930,MICROBUG TUG,
931,MICROBUG TUG,He's in the ear!
932,MICROBUG TUG,
933,MICROBUG TUG,Tug can't enjoy his vacation with all that racket. He climbs up
934,MICROBUG TUG,further until he's surrounded by tall stalks everywhere. There are
935,MICROBUG TUG,"thousands of them all next to each other and when a wind comes, they"
936,MICROBUG TUG,get blown all around. Do you know where he is?
937,MICROBUG TUG,He's in the hair!
938,MICROBUG TUG,
939,MICROBUG TUG,Tug sees something coming towards the hair and hops on when it gets
940,MICROBUG TUG,there. Now there are five things he's never seen before next to him.
941,MICROBUG TUG,"Four of them are longer, and one of them is shorter. Each of them"
942,MICROBUG TUG,"has a hard plate on the tip of it. Sometimes they point, sometimes"
943,MICROBUG TUG,"they wiggle, and sometimes they get together and snap! Do you know"
944,MICROBUG TUG,where Tug is?
945,MICROBUG TUG,He's on the hand!
946,MICROBUG TUG,
947,MICROBUG TUG,"Gosh, there's way too much excitement on the hand, so Tug hops off"
948,MICROBUG TUG,when the hand starts scratching another part of the body. Now he's
949,MICROBUG TUG,looking into two tunnels and air is coming in and out of each of
950,MICROBUG TUG,them. Tug notices that he's close to the mouth again. It looks like
951,MICROBUG TUG,"there are some short hairs inside, but he doesn't want to get any"
952,MICROBUG TUG,closer. Do you know where he is now?
953,MICROBUG TUG,
954,MICROBUG TUG,He's in the nose!
955,MICROBUG TUG,
956,MICROBUG TUG,All of a sudden there is a SNEEZE! Tug is thrown in the air until he
957,MICROBUG TUG,"falls into a bowl shaped hole. He crawls to the top, but there's"
958,MICROBUG TUG,"nothing close by. It's like he's in the middle of nowhere, or maybe"
959,MICROBUG TUG,it's the middle of the human body? Do you know where he is?
960,MICROBUG TUG,
961,MICROBUG TUG,He's in the belly button!
962,MICROBUG TUG,
963,MICROBUG TUG,"Wow, you really know the human body! Tug would be lost without you,"
964,MICROBUG TUG,"but he has had it with this vacation. The human body is not for him,"
965,MICROBUG TUG,so he grabs his bag and hops off.
966,MICROBUG TUG,

1044,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,it ate: a shoe.
1045,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,
1046,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,They said that Shoe was the smartest dog on Neptune. He could play

1050,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,
1051,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,I think that on Neptune dogs must eat human food because Shoe likes
1052,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,"to eat what I'm eating, but he hates his earthly dog food. He's a"

1056,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,
1057,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,I think dogs and squirrels are sworn enemies on Neptune because Shoe
1058,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,"is always barking at them. Also, I think that on Neptune, dog bowls"
1059,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,are shaped like toilets because Shoe loves drinking from ours.
1060,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,
1061,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,Shoe can eat more food than ANYONE on earth ever could. I know this
1062,MY DOG IS FROM NEPTUNE,for certain because my uncle can eat the most food in the entire

1220,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,
1221,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,One night his father had finally had enough.
1222,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"""No dancing at the dinner table!"" he shouted."
1223,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,But it didn't stop there.
1224,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,
1225,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"""No dancing in the car!"" he yelled the next morning."

1227,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"Until one day he said it: ""NO DANCING AT ALL!"""
1228,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,
1229,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"But even if he wanted to, Taylor just couldn't stop."
1230,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"So when Taylor was in school, he tapped his fingers."
1231,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"When Taylor was in bed, he hummed to himself."
1232,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"And when Taylor was alone, he danced."
1233,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,
1234,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,It was hard to find places to dance all alone.
1235,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"He tried the garage, but the car made it crowded."
1236,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"He tried the closet, but his clothes kept on falling."
1237,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,Finally he tried the basement.
1238,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,
1239,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"And that's where he found a small, dusty, crusty piano."
1240,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,He tapped his fingers on the keys and hummed a tune.
1241,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"Then the tapping turned into playing, and the humming turned"

1243,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,
1244,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"Everyday, he played his song."

1252,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,He was scared and nervous as he started to play for them.
1253,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,"But as he did, something began to happen."
1254,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,His father started to jiggle his toes.
1255,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,His mother started to wiggle her hips.
1256,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,They were moving and shaking and didn't know why.
1257,NO DANCING AT THE DINNER TABLE!,

1269,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1270,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1271,NOBLE GNARBLE,"Far below the ocean waves, a gnarble laid in bed,"
1272,NOBLE GNARBLE,All night long his gnarble dreams kept swimming in his head.
1273,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1274,NOBLE GNARBLE,"He dreamt a dream of swimming up to see the sky above,"
1275,NOBLE GNARBLE,Lit up by the sun in colors he just knew he'd love.
1276,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1277,NOBLE GNARBLE,"But gnarbles never swum that high, their fins were much too small,"
1278,NOBLE GNARBLE,"Their tails were thin and floppy, which didn't help at all."
1279,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1280,NOBLE GNARBLE,"This gnarble liked his fins and had no problem with his tail,"
1281,NOBLE GNARBLE,"So when he woke he knew that he just couldn't, wouldn't fail."
1282,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1283,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""I'm swimming up above the waves to see the sky of blue;"
1284,NOBLE GNARBLE,"I've never seen it even once, and now it's time I do."""
1285,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1286,NOBLE GNARBLE,"But the other gnarbles warned him that he shouldn't swim so high,"
1287,NOBLE GNARBLE,As did the blyfish family that always swam close by.
1288,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1289,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""No gnarble's ever swam that high, it simply isn't done,"
1290,NOBLE GNARBLE,"A blyfish might just make the trip, but we know you're not one."""
1291,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1292,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""Gnarbles don't have flappers like all us blyfish do,"
1293,NOBLE GNARBLE,"You don't even have koggers like the swimming gungaloo."""
1294,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1295,NOBLE GNARBLE,But the gnarble didn't listen and he left his friends behind.
1296,NOBLE GNARBLE,No silly blyfish family could ever change his mind.
1297,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1298,NOBLE GNARBLE,"He swam up past the boulders made of spongy gishy-gosh,"
1299,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1300,NOBLE GNARBLE,And flew right by the herd of floating feeding fipple-fosh.
1301,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1302,NOBLE GNARBLE,"His fins were getting tired but he knew he couldn't stop,"
1303,NOBLE GNARBLE,"So he kept swimming faster, trying hard to reach the top."
1304,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1305,NOBLE GNARBLE,Just then a hungry warckel blocked the gnarble with his fin.
1306,NOBLE GNARBLE,He grabbed him by his tail and brought him right up to his chin.
1307,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1308,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""I've never had a gnarble, this would be a tasty treat,"
1309,NOBLE GNARBLE,"But you're much too thin and tiny for big old me to eat."""
1310,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1311,NOBLE GNARBLE,"So the gnarble just kept swimming, and didn't dare to stop,"
1312,NOBLE GNARBLE,Until he heard the sound of a great big bubble POP!
1313,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1314,NOBLE GNARBLE,He turned around to see that he was in a bit of trouble.
1315,NOBLE GNARBLE,The sound he heard was that of a silver subbalubble.
1316,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1317,NOBLE GNARBLE,"The gnarble tried to hide somewhere that he could safely stay,"
1318,NOBLE GNARBLE,But the subbalubble saw him and was headed right his way.
1319,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1320,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""Oh Mister Subbalubble, please don't eat me up for lunch,"
1321,NOBLE GNARBLE,"I'll bring a yummy plant instead, for you to sit and munch?"""
1322,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1323,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""I've never seen a gnarble try to swim this high before."
1324,NOBLE GNARBLE,"What is it, little fishy, that you're up here looking for?"""
1325,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1326,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""If I could see the sky just once, I'd be a happy fish."
1327,NOBLE GNARBLE,"To do one flip above the waves would be my only wish."""
1328,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1329,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""Well sorry silly gnarble, but I cannot let you go."
1330,NOBLE GNARBLE,"It's subbalubble dinner time--you should've stayed below."""
1331,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1332,NOBLE GNARBLE,"The gnarble cowered back in fear and shook from fin to fin,"
1333,NOBLE GNARBLE,But then he saw a school of fish called shiny glimmy glin.
1334,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1335,NOBLE GNARBLE,"The glimmy glin swam right past the subbalubble's face,"
1336,NOBLE GNARBLE,And the gnarble grabbed a glimmy fin and quickly left that place.
1337,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1338,NOBLE GNARBLE,"The gnarble swam up higher still, until he saw some light."
1339,NOBLE GNARBLE,"He knew it had to be the sun and, Oh was it a sight!"
1340,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1341,NOBLE GNARBLE,"Closely by a plink was sleeping, lying on his back."
1342,NOBLE GNARBLE,He rubbed his giant belly as he dreamed about a snack.
1343,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1344,NOBLE GNARBLE,The gnarble smiled happily and set his fins a swimming
1345,NOBLE GNARBLE,"But he didn't see the plink wake up, for he was busy grinning."
1346,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1347,NOBLE GNARBLE,"The gnarble almost made it to the surface of the sea,"
1348,NOBLE GNARBLE,But the plink chomped down and swallowed him as if he were a pea.
1349,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1350,NOBLE GNARBLE,The gnarble sat inside the plink and started softly crying.
1351,NOBLE GNARBLE,"He'd never make it out, so was there any point in trying?"
1352,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1353,NOBLE GNARBLE,"But the Gnarble knew he'd come too close to quit and give up now,"
1354,NOBLE GNARBLE,"""There must be someway out of here. There's got to be somehow."""
1355,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1356,NOBLE GNARBLE,"So the gnarble swam around inside, trying very hard to think,"
1357,NOBLE GNARBLE,"And while he did, his floppy tail was tickling the plink."
1358,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1359,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1360,NOBLE GNARBLE,The plink was very ticklish and he couldn't hold it in.
1361,NOBLE GNARBLE,He tried to cover up his laugh with his giant plinkish fin.
1362,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1363,NOBLE GNARBLE,"But his mouth was open long enough for the gnarble to swim free,"
1364,NOBLE GNARBLE,He swam so fast the hungry plink did not have time to see.
1365,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1366,NOBLE GNARBLE,"Far above the ocean floor, above the gnarbles' homes,"
1367,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1368,NOBLE GNARBLE,"Above the blyfish families and dancing water-gnomes,"
1369,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1370,NOBLE GNARBLE,"Above the swimming gungaloo and slimy dundledun,"
1371,NOBLE GNARBLE,
1372,NOBLE GNARBLE,A gnarble flipped above the waves and smiled at the sun.

1428,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1429,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,A year later Philip had 12 pairs of socks run away from him!
1430,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,Obviously they were smart and had planned their escape well because
1431,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,Philip never figured out how they did it. When his mother went to
1432,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"buy him more socks, she asked what kind he wanted. ""The kind of"
1433,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"socks that can't climb out of a sock drawer,"" he said. She thought"
1434,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,he was joking.
1435,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1436,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"Whenever Philip did his homework, he had to hold the paper down. If"
1437,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"he let it go for one second, it would run off the desk and try to go"

1445,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,ruler.
1446,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1447,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,Philip took extra care to make sure that the ruler didn't run away.
1448,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,He took a string and tied one end around the ruler and the other end
1449,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"around his dresser. All night long he kept one eye on the ruler,"
1450,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,even as he was falling asleep.
1451,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1452,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"Philip thought he had outsmarted the ruler, but he was wrong. It"
1453,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,grew arms and legs and ran straight for the door. The string stopped
1454,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"it from getting out, but Philip had fallen asleep and didn't notice."
1455,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"The ruler used its hands to untie the string and crept out the door,"
1456,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,trying not to wake Philip up.
1457,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1458,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"Because the ruler was so tall and thin, it had trouble keeping its"
1459,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"balance on the stairs and it fell down, hitting every single step on"
1460,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,the way. The noise was loud enough to wake Philip up. He chased the
1461,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,ruler all through the house.
1462,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1463,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"The ruler ran through the dining room, and Philip followed after. It"

1465,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,caught it right before it reached the sidewalk.
1466,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1467,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"""Gotcha!"" he said. And just like that, the ruler stopped trying to"
1468,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,run away. Philip put it on the ground and it happily walked right
1469,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,back up to his room. Philip finally understood why the ruler was
1470,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,running way--it was playing a game! It just wanted to have some fun.
1471,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,
1472,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,"After that, Philip found a way to keep his toys entertained without"
1473,PHILIP LOSES EVERYTHING!,having them run away. His parents never yelled at him for losing

1769,WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DOT MAKES,
1770,WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DOT MAKES,It approached a newspaper that was lying nearby. There were dots all

1942,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"Before words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village in"
1943,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best,"
1944,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,smartest and most liked person in his village.
1945,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1946,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his"
1947,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,brother because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever
1948,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"the villagers asked No for help, he refused because he didn't like"
1949,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"people very much. Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would"
1950,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"gladly help, and he secretly didn't mind the fact that it irritated"
1951,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,No when he did.
1952,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1953,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"One day Yes and No's father, Okay, went on a long journey and he"
1954,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,left his two sons in charge of all the animals. Yes took good care
1955,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in"
1956,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were"
1957,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"ancient animals, so you might know them by different names today.]"
1958,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,No didn't want to be bothered with the boring tasks involved with
1959,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"taking care of the animals. So instead of helping his brother, No"
1960,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water.
1961,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1962,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"A few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the"
1963,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of
1964,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"doing what Yes had asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot"
1965,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,about the yock.
1966,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1967,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"It just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he"
1968,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"traveled on it often. So often, that when the three-toed yock"
1969,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"wandered onto the road, the King's carriage was passing by and had"
1970,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,to swerve to avoid hitting it. The King was thrown from the
1971,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"carriage, fell to the ground, and was badly injured."
1972,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1973,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on

1975,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire story."
1976,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1977,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"The King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an idea that"
1978,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the castle as
1979,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,his personal assistants as punishment for what was later referred to
1980,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"as ""the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in the Kingdom's"

1982,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1983,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,The King needed help with many things around the castle because a
1984,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,King cannot be bothered with the daily tasks involved with running a
1985,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"kingdom. However, soon after his decision about the two brothers,"
1986,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,the King realized that only Yes would be of any use to him as a

1988,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1989,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"Whenever the King asked No to bring him anything, it would get"
1990,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"thrown away, broken, or eaten, without exception. The King was quite"

1992,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1993,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,The brothers' most important task was to help pick the food for a
1994,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,grand party that the King was throwing later that night. Cooks from
1995,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,all over the kingdom lined up at the castle's gate to offer the King
1996,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"their food for the party. Of course, the King could not go and grab"
1997,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"the food himself, so he asked Yes and No to do it for him."
1998,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
1999,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"The first cook came up the gate and yelled to the Gatekeeper, ""I"
2000,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"bring my delicious ugberry pie for the King's banquet!"" The King"
2001,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,heard this and thought that ugberry pie would be perfect for such an
2002,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,event (and he knew that he would love to eat the leftovers). Because
2003,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"he didn't want anything to happen to the ugberry pie, the King"
2004,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"yelled ""Yes!"" and then asked him to go fetch it."
2005,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
2006,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"The next cook stepped up to the gate. ""I offer the King grukie"
2007,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"soup!"" he said. The King didn't like grukie soup very much and he"
2008,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"knew just how to get rid of it. ""No!"" he yelled and then sent No out"
2009,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,to retrieve the soup. No dropped the soup before the King could even
2010,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,smell it.
2011,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
2012,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"This went on for hours. If the king liked a dish, he would yell"
2013,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"""Yes!"" and it would be included in the night's feast. If he did not,"
2014,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"everyone would hear a loud ""NO!"" and the dish would be destroyed"
2015,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,moments later by a servant with a very bad attitude.
2016,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,
2017,THE STORY OF YES AND NO,"Pretty soon this started catching on around the kingdom, for if a"

2041,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Their small little hut was in Old Maladime.
2042,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Their tempers were short and they fought all the time.
2043,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,One day their Mother had seen more than enough.
2044,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,She packed up her Hackeling bag with her stuff.
2045,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2046,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,She slammed the front door with a sigh and a huff.
2047,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Without her around, they fought even more rough."
2048,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,(But do not be worried for the Troll Brother's fate.
2049,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Trolls are grown up by the time they turn eight.)
2050,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2051,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Later the smallest, named Small Itty Brother,"
2052,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Came in with a note from the Three Brother's Mother.
2053,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,The next biggest brother grabbed the note right away.
2054,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""I'll read this letter,"" he started to say."
2055,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2056,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""No you will not, Sorta Kinda Big Brother,"
2057,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"The biggest should read it, that's me and no other."""
2058,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,They both sat and listened to Brother Enormous
2059,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""It seems that our mother wrote this to inform us."""
2060,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2061,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""She's splitting us up, since we fight everyday."
2062,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,And our Troll Dad agrees that there's no other way.
2063,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"One of us trolls has to leave by the morning,"
2064,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"And also she added a personal warning."""
2065,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2066,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""If no one has left by the time she comes back,"
2067,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"She'll eat us all up for her afternoon snack!"""
2068,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"(Now even though trolls are ugly and tough,"
2069,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,I assure you this warning was merely a bluff.)
2070,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2071,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,The Trolls became panicked--one had to go!
2072,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Who should it be? And how would they know?
2073,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,The Three Troll Brothers all started to shout.
2074,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Itty proclaimed, ""You two can't kick me out!"""
2075,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2076,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Sorta Kinda Big Brother was yelling now, too."

2079,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"You can't push me out, you just wait and see!"""
2080,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2081,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Then Itty thought of his best idea ever.
2082,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"It was mean and despicable, but also real clever."
2083,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""It you two don't leave,"" Itty said with a laugh,"
2084,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""I'll take all your clothes and I'll tear them in half."""
2085,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2086,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Sorta Kinda Big Brother answered back with a squeak,"
2087,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""You tore all the pants that I own just last week!"
2088,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Now if someone won't pack and get out of this hut,"

2091,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Brother Enormous just laughed as he spoke.
2092,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""You already do that, this must be a joke."
2093,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Now leave or I'll pick you both up by your toes,"
2094,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"And then I'll stick Wickerloo bugs up your nose."""
2095,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2096,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Itty said, ""Well, I would like to see how,"
2097,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Since you already did--there are two up there now!"""
2098,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2099,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""Hmmmmm,"" said Itty Brother."
2100,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""Hmmmmm,"" said Kinda Sorta Big Brother."
2101,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""Hmmmmm,"" said Brother Enormous."
2102,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2103,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"They realized the truth, each one by one."
2104,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,There was nothing to do that hadn't been done.
2105,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,But what would occur when their Mother got in?
2106,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Whenever she argued, they just couldn't win."
2107,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2108,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"It seems that they'd have to try something quite new,"
2109,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,And stick with each other till it was all through.
2110,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2111,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"When Troll Mom came home, she got a surprise:"
2112,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"No loud sounds of yelling, no insults, or cries."
2113,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Small Itty Brother was sewing up clothes,"
2114,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,While Brother Enormous pulled bugs from his nose.
2115,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2116,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Kinda Sorta Big Brother was just very kind.
2117,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,Three better brothers would be hard to find.
2118,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"When she asked who was leaving, they simply refused."
2119,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"Needless to say, this left her confused."
2120,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,
2121,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""When we weren't being horrible,"" said Itty Brother,"
2122,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"""We found that we actually like one another."""
2123,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"She smiled when they said there would be no more fighting,"
2124,THE THREE BROTHERS OF MALADIME,"But as she hugged them, she asked if they'd put that in writing."

2133,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,
2134,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,It was the day that Farmer Duff waited for all year round: Today was
2135,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,Family Funday Sunday! The kids came rushing onto the farm as soon as
2136,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,the gates opened. They fed the goats. They rode the horses. They
2137,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,watched the pigs roll in the mud and tried to jump in with them. The
2138,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,rest of the day was spent running away from the goats who were
2139,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,looking for more food.
2140,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,
2141,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,"When everyone had left, all the animals gathered in the barn to fall"

2144,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,
2145,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,Something fell from the ceiling into a pile of hay. The dog started
2146,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,"barking loudly and the chickens ran in circles, bumping into each"
2147,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,other. Then the something on the floor started moving and dusting
2148,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,itself off. It had the oddest little vest and a very tall top hat.
2149,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,"(How it had stayed on his head, we'll never know.)"

2154,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,
2155,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,Then he pulled out from his vest an old wooden spoon. He waved it at
2156,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,"the ceiling and said, ""TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!"" And with that, the"
2157,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,"roof was fixed, just like new. ""Where did you come from?"" asked the"
2158,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,"sheep. ""How'd you'd that!"" said the dog."

2167,TREMENDOUS STUPENDOUS!,

2249,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,faster than the bumblebee. He flew higher than the falcon. And he
2250,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,flew fancier than the flying marmaduck (who was quite a fancy flier).
2251,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2252,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,The cricket wanted to fly all over the world. He flew to the East.
2253,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,Then he flew to the West. And then he flew to the South. But he had
2254,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,never flown to the North.
2255,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2256,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"The ant tried to warn him that he should not try. ""It's very cold up"

2259,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2260,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"The cricket, however, did not listen to the ant, because crickets do"
2261,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,whatever they want. He set off for the North that very night. It did
2262,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,not take him long to get there because he was such a fantastically
2263,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,fast and fancy flier.
2264,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2265,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,The cricket landed next to a pine tree as the sun began setting.
2266,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,There was snow everywhere he looked. There was snow on the trees.
2267,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,There was snow on the ground. And there was snow on top of the
2268,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,mountains.
2269,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2270,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,The moose came walking over to him very slowly. He spoke even more
2271,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"slowly. ""Ohhhh...Hello,"" said the moose. ""Bundle up, nighttime is"
2272,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"coming."" The cricket, however, did not listen to the moose because"
2273,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,crickets do whatever they want.
2274,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2275,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,He flew up into a pine tree to settle in for a good sleep. It did
2276,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,not take him long to get there because he was such an incredibly
2277,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,fast and fancy flier. The owl came flying over to the same branch.
2278,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"""You should find some shelter from the cold night,"" said the owl."
2279,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"The cricket, however, did not listen to the owl because crickets do"
2280,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,whatever they want.
2281,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2282,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"He crawled away from the owl and the branch, and he rested on a pile"
2283,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,of twigs. All the remarkably fast and fancy flying made him sleepier
2284,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,than he had ever been. The cricket slept all through the night until
2285,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,morning.
2286,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2287,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"When he woke up, he was ready to go back home and tell the ant about"
2288,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"his trip. He hopped high in the air to start flying, but he"
2289,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"couldn't. Instead, he fell right back into the snow. He hopped"
2290,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"again, even higher this time, but his wings would not work. They had"
2291,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,been frozen solid during the cold night.
2292,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2293,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"He tried to warm them up by rubbing them together, but it was no"
2294,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,use. The cricket had no choice but to hop all the way home. It took
2295,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"him days and days to return. By the time he got back, his wings had"
2296,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,almost become unfrozen.
2297,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2298,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,But it is important to know that wings are very special and very
2299,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"fragile, which is why the greatest care should always be taken"
2300,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"around them. They are not meant to be frozen, and once they are,"
2301,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,they may never be the same again.
2302,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2303,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"So even though the cricket's wings were no longer frozen, they still"
2304,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"could not fly anymore. And ever since then, the cricket stays on the"
2305,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"ground like his friend the ant, and he hops from place to place. And"
2306,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,now the cricket is the fastest and fanciest hopper there is.
2307,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2308,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"At nighttime, you can hear him chirping from rubbing his wings"
2309,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,together to keep warm. But he is doing much more than just that: At
2310,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"bedtime, the cricket is telling you how warm or cold it is by his"
2311,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"chirping. He chirps faster when it is warm, and he chirps slower"
2312,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,when it is cold. This way you will not make the same mistake that he
2313,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,"did. However, that is only if you decide to listen*."
2314,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,
2315,WHY THE CRICKET CHIRPS,* Dolbear's Law states that if you count the number of times a
