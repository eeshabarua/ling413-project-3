34,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
35,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,

38,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Who did in honor far surmount
39,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Most men of his estate.
40,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
41,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Sore sick he was, and like to die,"
42,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,No help his life could save;
43,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"His wife by him as sick did lie,"
44,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And both possessed one grave.
45,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
46,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"No love between these two was lost,"
47,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Each was to other kind;
48,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"In love they lived, in love they died,"
49,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And left two babes behind.
50,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
51,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The one, a fine and pretty boy,"
52,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Not passing three years old;
53,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The other, a girl more young than he,"
54,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And framed in beauty's mould.
55,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
56,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The father left his little son,"
57,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"As plainly doth appear,"
58,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"When he to perfect age should come,"
59,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Three hundred pounds a year.
60,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
61,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And to his little daughter Jane,"
62,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Five hundred pounds in gold,"
63,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"To be paid down on her marriage-day,"
64,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Which might not be controlled:
65,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
66,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"But if the children chanced to die,"
67,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Ere they to age should come,"
68,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Their uncle should possess their wealth;
69,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,For so the will did run.
70,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
71,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""Now, brother,"" said the dying man,"
72,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""Look to my children dear;"
73,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Be good unto my boy and girl,"
74,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"No friends else have they here:"""
75,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
76,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And up bespake their mother dear,"
77,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""O, brother kind,"" quoth she,"
78,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""You are the man must bring our babes"
79,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"To wealth or misery."""
80,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
81,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,These speeches then their brother spake
82,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,To this sick couple there:
83,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""The keeping of your little ones,"
84,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Sweet sister, do not fear."
85,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
86,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: THE PARENTS' DEATH.]
87,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
88,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: THE RUFFIANS' FIGHT.]
89,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
90,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""God never prosper me nor mine,"
91,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Nor aught else that I have,"
92,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,If I do wrong your children dear
93,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"When you are laid in grave."""
94,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
95,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,The parents being dead and gone
96,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The children home he takes,"
97,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And brings them straight unto his house,"
98,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Where much of them he makes.
99,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
100,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He had not kept these pretty babes
101,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"A twelvemonth and a day,"
102,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"But, for their wealth, he did devise"
103,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,To make them both away.
104,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
105,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He bargained with two ruffians strong
106,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Which were of furious mood,"
107,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"That they should take these children young,"
108,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And slay them in a wood.
109,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
110,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He told his wife an artful tale:
111,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He would the children send
112,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"To be brought up in fair London,"
113,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,With one that was his friend.
114,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
115,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Away then went those pretty babes,"
116,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Rejoicing at that tide,"
117,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Rejoicing with a merry mind,"
118,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,They should on cock-horse ride.
119,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
120,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"They prate and prattle pleasantly,"
121,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"As they rode on the way,"
122,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"To those that should their butchers be,"
123,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And work their lives' decay.
124,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
125,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"So that the pretty speech they had,"
126,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Made murder's heart relent:
127,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And they that undertook the deed,"
128,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Full sore did now repent.
129,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
130,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Yet one of them, more hard of heart,"
131,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Did vow to do his charge,"
132,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Because the wretch that hired him,"
133,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Had paid him very large.
134,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
135,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The other won't agree thereto,"
136,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,So here they fall to strife;
137,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,With one another they did fight
138,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,About the children's life.
139,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
140,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And he that was of mildest mood,"
141,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Did slay the other there,"
142,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Within an unfrequented wood:
143,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,The babes did quake for fear.
144,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
145,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"He took the children by the hand,"
146,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Tears standing in their eye,"
147,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And bade them straightway follow him,"
148,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And look, they did not cry;"
149,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
150,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: THE CHILDREN DEAD.]
151,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
152,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: THE UNCLE PUNISHED.]
153,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
154,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And two long miles he led them on,"
155,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,While they for food complain:
156,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""Stay here,"" quoth he, ""I'll bring you bread,"
157,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"When I come back again."""
158,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
159,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"These pretty babes, with hand in hand"
160,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Went wandering up and down;
161,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,But never more could see the man
162,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Approaching from the town.
163,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
164,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Thus wandered these poor innocents
165,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Till death did end their grief,"
166,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"In one another's arms they died,"
167,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,As wanting due relief:
168,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
169,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,No burial this pretty pair
170,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Of any man receives,"
171,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Till Robin Redbreast piously
172,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Did cover them with leaves.
173,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
174,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And now the heavy wrath of God
175,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Upon their uncle fell;
176,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,"
177,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,His conscience felt an hell:
178,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
179,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"His barns were fired, his goods consumed,"
180,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"His lands were barren made,"
181,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"His cattle died within the field,"
182,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And nothing with him stayed.
183,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
184,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And in the voyage to Portugal
185,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Two of his sons did die;
186,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And to conclude, himself was brought"
187,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,To want and misery.
188,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
189,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He pawned and mortgaged all his land
190,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Ere seven years came about,"
191,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And now at length this wicked act
192,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Did by this means come out:
193,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
194,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,The fellow that did take in hand
195,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"These children for to kill,"
196,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Was for a robbery judged to die,"
197,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Such was God's blessed will.
198,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
199,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Who did confess the very truth,"
200,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,As here hath been displayed:
201,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Their uncle having died in jail,"
202,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Where he for debt was laid.
203,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
204,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"You that executors be made,"
205,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And overseers eke
206,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Of children that be fatherless,"
207,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And infants mild and meek;
208,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
209,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Take you example by this thing,"
210,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And yield to each his right,"
211,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Lest God with such like misery
212,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Your wicked minds requite.
