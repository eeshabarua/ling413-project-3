27,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,SOPHIE'S ROSES.
28,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
29,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
30,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,Fräulein Hoffman always gave the girls at her school a holiday on the
31,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,tenth of June. It was her birthday; and though the old lady would not
32,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"allow her pupils to make her any presents, saying, in her firm manner,"
33,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""Such things speedily become a tax, my dears,"" yet she was always"
34,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"pleased that they should decorate the schoolrooms in her honor, and hang"
35,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,a handsome wreath round her father's picture.
36,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
37,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,So on the evening before the birthday the day-girls would bring baskets
38,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"of flowers, and the big schoolroom table was brought out into the"
39,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"garden, and there the wreaths and garlands were made amid much"
40,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,chattering and laughing by the happy children.
41,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
42,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""There,"" said Marie Schmidt, with a satisfied smile, as she held up a"
43,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"large wreath for general admiration. ""That's finished at last! and I"
44,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,flatter myself that the old gentleman never had so handsome a decoration
45,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"in his lifetime as I have now made for his picture."""
46,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
47,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"The girls laughed; but gentle Adela Righton, the only English girl at"
48,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"the school, said quietly, ""Take care, Marie; Fräulein Hoffman might hear"
49,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"you, and it would hurt her feelings to think that we were laughing at"
50,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"her father."""
51,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
52,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""I don't want to laugh at any one, you sober old Adela,"" returned the"
53,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"reckless Marie. ""I only think the old gentleman's hooked nose and beady"
54,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"black eyes will look very well under my wreath of lilies and roses."""
55,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
56,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"Adela said no more, for she saw that her words only excited Marie; and"
57,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,fortunately at that moment a diversion was created by a girl coming into
58,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,the garden with two immense baskets of cabbage-roses and white
59,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,moss-buds.
60,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
61,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""What! more flowers? Why could you not bring them sooner, you tiresome"
62,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"girl?"" exclaimed Lotta, who, having finished her garland for the"
63,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"schoolroom window, was more inclined for a romp than for any other"
64,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,flower-wreathing.
65,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
66,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""Throw them away! bury them in a hole!"" said impetuous Marie, getting up"
67,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"and shaking the petals off her dress. ""We've done the wreaths now,"
68,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"Sophie, so your flowers have come too late. I'll tell you what, though:"
69,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"we might fasten a rose to the end of Fanny's pig-tails, and then they"
70,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"would indeed be rose-red."""
71,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
72,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""No, thank you, Marie: I prefer my pig-tails unadorned,"" said Fanny"
73,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"good-temperedly, for she was accustomed to jokes on her red hair."
74,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
75,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""Throw the flowers on the grass, Sophie! we really can't begin again"
76,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"now!"" declared Marie. ""I'm going to teach the girls a new game. Now,"
77,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"children, stand in a row. Now hold out your frocks and sing with me."""
78,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"And Marie, leaning against a tree, proceeded to give her orders, and,"
79,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"being somewhat blunt, did not notice the grieved look on Sophie's face"
80,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,as she thought of her wasted flowers.
81,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
82,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""Poor roses!"" said Adela kindly, noticing Sophie's discomfiture. ""They"
83,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"are too sweet to be wasted. May I use them as I like, Sophie?"""
84,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
85,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""Oh, yes, dear Adela!"" said Sophie, brightening. She was a fair, pretty"
86,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"child, with a shady hat tied under her dimpled chin; and seeing Adela"
87,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"stooping to pick up the despised flowers, her spirits rose, and she"
88,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"joined the others in their game under the tree, and danced and sang with"
89,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,the rest.
90,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
91,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,[Illustration: MARIE TEACHES THEM A NEW GAME.]
92,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
93,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"When Fräulein Hoffman went early the next morning, as was her yearly"
94,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"custom, to deposit a wreath on her father's grave, she found, to her"
95,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"surprise and intense delight, that some one had been before her."
96,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
97,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"The grave was literally covered with sweet rose-petals, and round the"
98,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"border, in white rose-buds, were the words,--"
99,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
100,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""Not lost, but gone before."""
101,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
102,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"Her heart was full to overflowing at this kindly act, and at breakfast,"
103,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"in the gayly-decorated room, she made the girls a little speech."
104,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
105,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"""Dear girls, you are all young, and have still your friends and"
106,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"relations with you. Mine are all now in God's keeping, but it is very"
107,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,sweet to me to believe that they who loved me so well when on earth
108,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,still think of me in Heaven. You have helped me to realize this by your
109,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"tender care of my dear father's grave, and in his name and my own I"
110,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"thank you."""
111,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,
112,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"There was silence for a minute or two, for the old lady's speech had"
113,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"moved even the giddy Marie. Then Sophie pressed Adela's hand, and"
114,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"whispered gratefully, ""My roses went to decorate God's garden; that is"
115,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,"best of all."""
116,SOPHIE'S ROSES.,

121,MARY'S PIGEONS.,MARY'S PIGEONS.
122,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
123,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
124,MARY'S PIGEONS.,I can't believe there are prettier pigeons than mine anywhere in the
125,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"world. Every morning and every afternoon I feed them myself, and they"
126,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"are so tame they eat out of my hand, or out of the basin when I hold it"
127,MARY'S PIGEONS.,for them.
128,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
129,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"There is some one else who thinks them as pretty as I do, and I'll tell"
130,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"you all about her. It was last year, early in the autumn, that I went"
131,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"out with the pan into the front yard to feed them, and walked down the"
132,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"stone steps, calling the pigeons all the way, while they flew after me."
133,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"I didn't notice anything in the road, which was just in front of me,"
134,MARY'S PIGEONS.,until I saw a very big man in a grand livery picking his way across the
135,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"yard, and then I noticed a carriage had stopped in front of the house,"
136,MARY'S PIGEONS.,and the lady inside was looking at me and at my pigeons. She beckoned me
137,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"to come to her; but I was too shy, and ran into the house, to find"
138,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"Mother, who went out to the lady, and I followed just behind her."
139,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
140,MARY'S PIGEONS.,And what do you think the lady wanted? To buy my pigeons--my beautiful
141,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"pigeons! She offered me a dollar, and then two, and then three; but I"
142,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"shook my head every time, and hugged the pigeon that was in my arms. At"
143,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"last she showed me five dollars in gold, and asked if I would let them"
144,MARY'S PIGEONS.,go for that. But I couldn't--it didn't seem as if any money could pay me
145,MARY'S PIGEONS.,for the loss of my pigeons.
146,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
147,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"Mother said I must do as I liked about it, for they were my very own,"
148,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"but she said five dollars was a great deal of money, and more than the"
149,MARY'S PIGEONS.,pigeons were worth; only I didn't think so.
150,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
151,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"Then the lady said she wouldn't ask me any more, but in case I changed"
152,MARY'S PIGEONS.,my mind she would give Mother her card. I was sorry I couldn't let her
153,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"have my birds, but then I dare say she has lots of pretty things, and I"
154,MARY'S PIGEONS.,have only my pigeons.
155,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
156,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"Well, Father and William laughed at me for some time about the pigeons;"
157,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"and if I wanted any money for shoes or anything, Father would say,"
158,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"""Dear me! how well Mary's five dollars would have paid for this!"" But"
159,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"that was only laughingly, for he would never have taken my money."
160,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
161,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"This spring my pigeons made a nest, and there were two eggs in it, and"
162,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"after a time two birds, that grew just like the others. I was thinking"
163,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"about the lady one day, and I thought, as I had refused to sell her the"
164,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"old birds, I had better offer to give her the young ones. So next day"
165,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"William carried them over in a basket, and left them at the house."
166,MARY'S PIGEONS.,
167,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"A few days after, the carriage stopped again before our house, and this"
168,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"time the lady came in and sat in the parlor, and ate a piece of Mother's"
169,MARY'S PIGEONS.,cake and drank a glass of new milk. But before she went away she gave me
170,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"a parcel which she said was for my very own, and she hoped I would take"
171,MARY'S PIGEONS.,as good care of it as I did of my pigeons. And when I looked there was
172,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"the most beautiful work-case in the world! I used not to like my sewing,"
173,MARY'S PIGEONS.,"but now I do, because I use the work-case and the silver thimble every"
174,MARY'S PIGEONS.,time!

178,A CAGE STORY.,A CAGE STORY.
179,A CAGE STORY.,
180,A CAGE STORY.,
181,A CAGE STORY.,"Now, Pussy, don't turn away and look sulky. I've only put you in Polly's"
182,A CAGE STORY.,cage so that you may understand a real true cage story that Uncle Rupert
183,A CAGE STORY.,"told me last night. He's a soldier, you know, and he wears a red sash,"
184,A CAGE STORY.,"just like mine, only he does not wear it round his waist as little girls"
185,A CAGE STORY.,"do, but across his shoulder."
186,A CAGE STORY.,
187,A CAGE STORY.,"Well, that's not the story, but this is. Uncle Rupert was in China,"
188,A CAGE STORY.,"where the men wear pig-tails down their back, and it was war time: the"
189,A CAGE STORY.,"English were fighting against the Chinese. He told me why, but I've"
190,A CAGE STORY.,"forgotten, but I know in the end the English won; but they lost a battle"
191,A CAGE STORY.,"first, and Uncle Rupert was taken prisoner. English people are kind to"
192,A CAGE STORY.,"their prisoners, Pussy, but the Chinese are very cruel. Uncle Rupert"
193,A CAGE STORY.,says he could not tell me the dreadful things that they did to some of
194,A CAGE STORY.,"the poor English soldiers, but he told me what they did to him, and"
195,A CAGE STORY.,"though it was dreadful it was rather funny too. Listen, Pussy! They made"
196,A CAGE STORY.,"a big cage, only it wasn't nearly big enough, and they shut Uncle up in"
197,A CAGE STORY.,"it, and slung it on a big stick, and carried him about as a show to all"
198,A CAGE STORY.,"the towns and villages. It was very hot, and Uncle was so cramped up in"
199,A CAGE STORY.,"the cage that he could hardly move, and he was very hungry and thirsty,"
200,A CAGE STORY.,"and very, very miserable. The people used to come and stare at him, and"
201,A CAGE STORY.,"tease him by poking nice fruit through the bars, and then snatching it"
202,A CAGE STORY.,away before he could eat it. Uncle Rupert said he longed to die; but he
203,A CAGE STORY.,"said one thing, Pussy, which I must always remember, only I'm afraid you"
204,A CAGE STORY.,won't understand this. He told me how glad he was that when he was a
205,A CAGE STORY.,little boy his mother had taught him a great many texts and hymns. They
206,A CAGE STORY.,"all came into his mind then, and they comforted him very much, and made"
207,A CAGE STORY.,"him remember that God was near him, even in the cage. So he was patient,"
208,A CAGE STORY.,"and at last he was saved, for some English soldiers marched to the"
209,A CAGE STORY.,"village, and the Chinese ran away and left the cage behind them, and you"
210,A CAGE STORY.,may be sure the soldiers soon got Uncle Rupert out.

216,A THANKOFFERING.,A THANKOFFERING.
217,A THANKOFFERING.,
218,A THANKOFFERING.,
219,A THANKOFFERING.,"Ada Fortescue was recovering from a long and dangerous illness, and for"
220,A THANKOFFERING.,"the last week she had been able to lie on a sofa near the window, and"
221,A THANKOFFERING.,see the people passing through the street as they trudged on their way
222,A THANKOFFERING.,to the city. Ada was twelve years old; and as she lay on her sofa she
223,A THANKOFFERING.,"had many thoughts, some very serious, but most were happy and grateful."
224,A THANKOFFERING.,
225,A THANKOFFERING.,"Ada was Dr. Fortescue's only child, and her mother had been dead for"
226,A THANKOFFERING.,eight years. During her illness Ada had often seen how grave her father
227,A THANKOFFERING.,"looked, but now his thankfulness brought tears into her eyes. It was so"
228,A THANKOFFERING.,"nice to be loved so very much, thought Ada."
229,A THANKOFFERING.,
230,A THANKOFFERING.,"To-day a very absorbing thought was in her mind, and she looked up and"
231,A THANKOFFERING.,down the street with more than usual interest. That morning her father
232,A THANKOFFERING.,had told her that he had put aside a sum of money as a thankoffering for
233,A THANKOFFERING.,"her recovery, and she might choose the way in which it should be spent."
234,A THANKOFFERING.,"What should she do? Ada thought of the missionaries far away, of the new"
235,A THANKOFFERING.,"church close by, of the hospital, and the orphanage."
236,A THANKOFFERING.,
237,A THANKOFFERING.,At that moment a noise in the street attracted her attention. A man was
238,A THANKOFFERING.,"loudly scolding a little boy, who was crying bitterly. The boy looked"
239,A THANKOFFERING.,"pale and tired; and Ada felt very sorry for him, so she opened the"
240,A THANKOFFERING.,"window to hear what was the matter. The man had come out of his shop,"
241,A THANKOFFERING.,"and was saying angrily, ""Do you think I have nothing to do but give"
242,A THANKOFFERING.,"glasses of water to every vagabond who goes by? Be off with you, and"
243,A THANKOFFERING.,"don't stand there crying and making a crowd collect,"" for some of those"
244,A THANKOFFERING.,who were passing had paused to find out what was the matter.
245,A THANKOFFERING.,
246,A THANKOFFERING.,"Ada rang the bell and sent the maid out to the little boy, who came"
247,A THANKOFFERING.,"thankfully for some water, only the water was nearly all milk, and there"
248,A THANKOFFERING.,was a bun and a piece of bread for him besides. What a happy little boy
249,A THANKOFFERING.,"he felt, and what a happy little girl was Ada as she met her father at"
250,A THANKOFFERING.,"the door of her room, saying, ""I know, I know! a _drinking fountain_,"
251,A THANKOFFERING.,"father!"""
252,A THANKOFFERING.,
253,A THANKOFFERING.,"At first Dr. Fortescue could not understand what she meant, but when she"
254,A THANKOFFERING.,explained he thought it was a very good idea.
255,A THANKOFFERING.,
256,A THANKOFFERING.,Some months later when Ada had a bad cold and was up in her room once
257,A THANKOFFERING.,"more, it amused her to watch her drinking fountain, which was in the"
258,A THANKOFFERING.,"opposite wall, and see all the people who drank at it, and she was very"
259,A THANKOFFERING.,glad when one day she recognized the little boy who had first put the
260,A THANKOFFERING.,"idea of a drinking fountain into her head. He had a roll in his hand,"
261,A THANKOFFERING.,and wore a nice tidy suit of clothes; and when Ada sent the maid to
262,A THANKOFFERING.,inquire after him she heard that he was on the way to see his mother
263,A THANKOFFERING.,"with a quarter's wages in his pocket, for he had got a good place and"
264,A THANKOFFERING.,meant to do all he could to keep it.

271,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,
272,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,
273,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"""Only an old coat! That's what it is surely, but that old coat cost me a"
274,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"good friend, it did. Poor old Tinker was worth more than a dozen coats."""
275,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"So said Eli Watton, as he put the old coat over his shoulders, and"
276,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,settled himself in his donkey-cart with a man by his side who had asked
277,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,for a lift.
278,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,
279,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"""Who was poor old Tinker?"" asked the stranger."
280,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,
281,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"""My dog,"" answered Eli, ""and a better one never followed any man. Poor"
282,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"fellow! though he weren't much to look at. Well, I'll tell you how it"
283,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"was I lost him, poor chap. Every Friday I have to drive into town to"
284,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"fetch the clothes for my wife to wash, and I often had to go in again on"
285,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"a Monday with clean ones. Tinker, poor fellow, used to go with me most"
286,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"times, but I never gave much heed to him. He'd always follow without a"
287,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"word. He was an ugly brute, people used to say--a sort of lurcher, and"
288,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,he never got much petting from any one.
289,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,
290,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"""Well, one day I drove as usual, and I had this old coat over the basket"
291,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,of clothes. When I got to one house I suppose I pitched the old coat
292,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"out, but I never heeded it; and I never noticed whether Tinker was with"
293,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,me or not. That night we missed Tinker; and my wife couldn't think what
294,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"I'd done with the old coat, and I couldn't remember anything about it."
295,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,
296,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"""On Monday I had to go to that same house, and there I found my poor old"
297,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"Tinker dead; they'd had him shot. I _was_ in a way about it, I can tell"
298,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"you. It was in this way, you see. This old coat was in a doorway, where"
299,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,I suppose I threw it when I was taking down the basket. Old Tinker saw I
300,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"left it there, and he sat down upon it to keep it safe for me, showing"
301,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,his teeth at anybody who offered to touch it. The servants got
302,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"frightened; they tried to beat him away, and they tried to coax him"
303,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"away, but he wouldn't stir, and at last they thought he must be mad, and"
304,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,told their mistress. She came and did all she could to coax the dog
305,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"away, for he was right in the way when they went out or in; but he"
306,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"snarled at them all. He must have been pretty near starved, lying there"
307,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"all Saturday night and Sunday, and I dare say he did get fiercer and"
308,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"fiercer, so at last they got him shot."
309,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,
310,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"""I've never had a dog along with me again. I don't suppose I shall ever"
311,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,get one like Tinker. I always think of him when I take up this old
312,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,"coat;"" and Eli gave his donkey a cut with the whip, and I am not sure if"
313,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,there was not something like a tear in his eye as he thought of his lost
314,A TRUE STORY OF A FAITHFUL DOG.,Tinker. What did it matter that he was an ugly dog? He did his duty to

347,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
348,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
349,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"Two houses stood side by side, as much alike as two twins. Honeysuckle"
350,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"and sweetbrier climbed over the rustic porches, flowers bloomed gayly in"
351,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"the gardens, and the warm sun shone equally on both. In each lived a"
352,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,little girl who had an invisible fairy companion. The children were the
353,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"same size, the same age, and had the same advantages, with this"
354,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"difference, that the one fairy was good and the other bad."
355,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
356,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"A ray of sunshine glides through the window into the first house, and"
357,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"shines encouragingly on little Minnie, who is trying to do her lessons."
358,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
359,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,But the bad fairy has set her pygmies to work. One persuades her that
360,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"she will do her lessons better if she sits in an easy-chair, another"
361,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"puts a cushion at her back, while a third fans her face so gently that"
362,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"the soft breeze, fragrant with honeysuckle and sweetbrier, soon sends"
363,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"her off to sleep, but not to rest. To her dismay the pygmy sweep comes"
364,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"round the corner, and with his sooty brush sweeps the pages of her new"
365,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"atlas. The coalheavers turn over her inkstand upon it, and the black"
366,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"fluid comes streaming down. Aunt Susan's sharp voice calls out, ""Mind"
367,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"your dress, you naughty child."""
368,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
369,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,Minnie puts her hand across it; but the fireman quickly pulls aside the
370,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"table-cloth, runs his finger down the stream, and her lap is a pool of"
371,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,ink.
372,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
373,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"""Won't you catch it?"" says an old woman, with a delighted chuckle; and"
374,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"the pygmy under the table crawls out, grinning with pleasure."
375,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
376,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"""We can take the horse to the water, if we cannot make him drink,"""
377,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,shouts a newsboy in her ear; and with a great deal of tugging and
378,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,thumping she feels herself driven closer to her books. But idle hands
379,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"make an idle brain, and the pages seem only a blank."
380,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
381,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"""How long wilt thou sleep, lazy one?"" cries a grave face in spectacles"
382,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,and lawns. With a sleepy feeling she turns her head away from his stern
383,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"gaze, only to meet the sterner faces of the judges, who are examining"
384,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,her untidy copy-book.
385,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
386,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"""Not a single line written this morning. What have you to say in"
387,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"self-defence?"""
388,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
389,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"""Please, sir, the acrobat had my pen balanced on his nose,"" said Minnie"
390,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,feebly.
391,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
392,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"""An excuse is worse than a lie,"" answered one of the judges; ""for an"
393,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"excuse is a lie guarded."" The book closed with a bang, and the judge"
394,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,marched off to consider the verdict.
395,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
396,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"At this moment Minnie started up in a fright, to find the dinner-bell"
397,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"ringing, the inkstand upset in her hurry, and no lessons done."
398,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
399,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,And now she had to go and wash her hands and make herself tidy for
400,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,dinner. What would mother say when she came to know how little Minnie
401,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,had done that morning?
402,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
403,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"A ray of sunshine shone through the window of the second house also, and"
404,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"softly kissed the rosy cheek of little Winnie, as she lay sleeping in"
405,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,her cot.
406,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
407,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"""Get up,"" said a small voice in her ear: ""it is your turn to arrange the"
408,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"schoolroom to-day."""
409,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
410,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"Winnie jumped out of bed, and was dressed in less than no time; for the"
411,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,good fairy had set her train to wait on her. Her shoes were placed ready
412,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"to her feet, her strings did not get into knots, and even her hair was"
413,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,not tangled.
414,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
415,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"Running down into the schoolroom, and tying on a large apron, she set to"
416,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"work to polish the mahogany cupboard with so good a will that Jack Tar,"
417,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"who stood above it, fairly clapped his hands with glee. Two neat little"
418,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"maids swept the floor, and two little men with their tiny brushes took"
419,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,up the dust. The highest shelf in the book-case was soon mounted by one
420,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"of the pygmies, whilst two on the next shelf dusted and handed him the"
421,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,books. The carpet-cleaner stretched and nailed down a corner of the
422,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"drugget which had been kicked up. The coachman, footman, butler, and"
423,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,buttons stood in readiness to carry out the orders of Policeman X. It
424,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,was a good thing Policeman X was there; for quite a crowd had collected
425,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,to see the work so briskly going on. The three little pygmies climbed up
426,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,the rail of a chair to beeswax and polish it. A bookbinder sat
427,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"cross-legged on one corner, arranging the loose leaves of a book; and a"
428,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"fat cobbler sat balanced on the rail below, singing, ""A stitch in time"
429,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"saves nine."""
430,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
431,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,The work was soon done; and when Aunt Susan came into the room she
432,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"praised little Winnie, and said the white hen had laid her an egg for"
433,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,breakfast.
434,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,
435,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"Now, perhaps, you would like to know the names of the two fairies who"
436,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,attended the little girls. The good fairy was called Work-with-a-will;
437,THE GOOD AND BAD FAIRIES.,"the bad fairy, No-will-to-work."

442,HELPING MOTHER.,
443,HELPING MOTHER.,
444,HELPING MOTHER.,"It was a lovely summer's day; there was a hot sun with a nice breeze,"
445,HELPING MOTHER.,"and Mrs. Jones, who had a heavy wash on her hands, was delighted."
446,HELPING MOTHER.,
447,HELPING MOTHER.,"""I shall get all dried off before night,"" she exclaimed, as she hung out"
448,HELPING MOTHER.,"the snowy sheets, and the children's shirts and pinafores, which latter"
449,HELPING MOTHER.,looked rather like doll's clothes as they hung on the line beside
450,HELPING MOTHER.,father's great stockings.
451,HELPING MOTHER.,
452,HELPING MOTHER.,"Tommy and Jeannie, of course, were there too, and very busy, as they had"
453,HELPING MOTHER.,taken it into their heads to plant all the clothes-pegs they could lay
454,HELPING MOTHER.,"hands upon, under the idea that they would soon grow into cabbages!"
455,HELPING MOTHER.,
456,HELPING MOTHER.,"""Dear! dear!"" exclaimed poor Mrs. Jones, when she turned round, having"
457,HELPING MOTHER.,"filled the line, and found out what her children had been after. ""Did"
458,HELPING MOTHER.,any one ever see such children? I must get them away from the wash
459,HELPING MOTHER.,"somehow. See now, duckies, I'll get you some cherries off the tree, and"
460,HELPING MOTHER.,"you'll play pretty on the bench, and let mother get on with her work,"
461,HELPING MOTHER.,"won't you?"""
462,HELPING MOTHER.,
463,HELPING MOTHER.,"""Yes, mother, we'll be ever so good,"" declared Tommy; and Jeannie, who"
464,HELPING MOTHER.,"could not speak plainly, echoed solemnly, ""Never good!"""
465,HELPING MOTHER.,
466,HELPING MOTHER.,"So Mrs. Jones fetched a ladder and gathered some juicy cherries, and for"
467,HELPING MOTHER.,a long time the children played with them happily enough. First of all
468,HELPING MOTHER.,"Tommy kept a jeweller's shop on the old bench, and sold cherry earrings"
469,HELPING MOTHER.,"to Jeannie, who tried to fasten the double cherries on to her fat little"
470,HELPING MOTHER.,"ears. Then she kept shop, and sold cherry boots to Tommy, and then they"
471,HELPING MOTHER.,"got the doll's perambulator and wheeled the cherries to market, and then"
472,HELPING MOTHER.,"Tommy said it was time to eat the cherries, and he divided them fairly,"
473,HELPING MOTHER.,and soon ate his share up. But what a mess he did make of his hands and
474,HELPING MOTHER.,"face! they were stained black with cherry juice. ""Never mind!"" said"
475,HELPING MOTHER.,"Tommy calmly, ""I'll soon wipe it all off;"" and catching hold of a sheet"
476,HELPING MOTHER.,"which hung on the line near, he first rubbed himself quite clean, and"
477,HELPING MOTHER.,"then gave Jeannie's hands a rub, too, on this most convenient towel. Not"
478,HELPING MOTHER.,"till he had finished, and the sheet was again flapping in the wind, did"
479,HELPING MOTHER.,thoughtless Tommy reflect on the mischief he had done. But when he saw
480,HELPING MOTHER.,"the purple stains on the clean sheet he began to cry bitterly, and"
481,HELPING MOTHER.,"running to his mother, he pulled her round and showed her the"
482,HELPING MOTHER.,cherry-stained sheet.
483,HELPING MOTHER.,
484,HELPING MOTHER.,"""Look, mother! look! But I didn't mean to,"" he sobbed."
485,HELPING MOTHER.,
486,HELPING MOTHER.,"""Mothers,"" says an old writer, ""should be all patience,"" and certainly"
487,HELPING MOTHER.,"Mrs. Jones needed patience that morning. She did look vexed at first, as"
488,HELPING MOTHER.,"she saw her work undone, but the next minute she was able to say gently,"
489,HELPING MOTHER.,"""What a pity, Tommy! You should think a bit, and then you would be able"
490,HELPING MOTHER.,"to help me when I'm busy,"" and that was all. She took the sheet down and"
491,HELPING MOTHER.,put it once more in the wash-tub.
492,HELPING MOTHER.,
493,HELPING MOTHER.,Meanwhile Tommy sat quietly sucking his thumb. He always sucked his
494,HELPING MOTHER.,"thumb when he thought, and just now he had a great deal to think of."
495,HELPING MOTHER.,"Mother had said he might help her! That was quite a new idea to Tommy,"
496,HELPING MOTHER.,and he sucked his thumb harder than ever.
497,HELPING MOTHER.,
498,HELPING MOTHER.,That summer's day marked a turning point in Tommy's life. He then
499,HELPING MOTHER.,"determined--little fellow as he was--to help mother, and it was"
500,HELPING MOTHER.,wonderful how soon the thoughtless little pickle grew into a helpful
501,HELPING MOTHER.,boy.
502,HELPING MOTHER.,
503,HELPING MOTHER.,"""It seems as if he couldn't do enough for me,"" Mrs. Jones would declare,"
504,HELPING MOTHER.,"with honest pride in her tone; ""and Jeannie, she copies Tommy, and"
505,HELPING MOTHER.,between them both they'll fetch and carry and run for me till I seem as
506,HELPING MOTHER.,"if I had nothing left for me to do. I'm a lucky woman, that I am!"""

647,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,
648,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"Oscar, who was a Newfoundland with a bit of the retriever in him, had"

651,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,
652,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"Bruno, on the other hand, was a huge mastiff, who was kept to guard the"

654,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,suspicious-looking stranger who approached the house--his growl was
655,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,enough to frighten the stoutest-hearted beggar in the world.
656,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,
657,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"My father thought Bruno was getting a little lazy, so proposed to take"
658,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"him down to the river with Oscar. I was to accompany them, and see poor"

660,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,
661,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"The river was not very broad, narrow enough to be spanned by an old"

664,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"Bruno floundered about, and at last got into the deep centre current,"

668,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"for he swam out to Bruno, and taking hold of his strong leather collar"
669,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"between his teeth, he lifted his head and shoulders out of the water. I"
670,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"eagerly watched them, for Bruno was very heavy, and it looked as if poor"

672,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,
673,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"Father encouraged Oscar, for I saw the fear in his face too; and making"
674,OSCAR AND BRUNO.,"one supreme effort, struggling and panting, Oscar brought Bruno into"

689,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,than to learn by one's own experience. But Tom always knew beforehand
690,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,anything that his father or mother could tell him; and the result was
691,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"that he often found himself in the wrong, and more than once suffered"
692,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,for his conceit and self-sufficiency.
693,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
694,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Tom had lived in London all his life, with only occasional visits to the"
695,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"seaside and a few days in the country at Christmas, when his father and"
696,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,mother usually went on a visit to his uncle's house at Felford. He was
697,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"therefore much excited when at breakfast one morning, just after the"
698,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Midsummer holidays had begun, his mother handed a letter across the"
699,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"table to her husband, asking, ""What do you think of _that_?"""
700,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
701,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Tom's quick eyes saw that the writing was his uncle's. He watched, and"
702,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,saw his father and mother both glance at him.
703,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
704,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Well, Tom, I see you have your suspicions about this letter,"" said his"
705,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"father; ""and you are right. It _does_ concern you. Your uncle has asked"
706,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,you to go to Felford. Your aunt and the little ones will be away; but
707,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"your uncle will be at home, and Allan will be there to keep you company."
708,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Now, do you think you can be trusted to go alone, and not give your"
709,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"uncle any trouble, or lead Allan into mischief?"""
710,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
711,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Why, of course, Father!"" Tom answered readily."
712,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
713,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""I am sorry to say there is no 'of course' in the matter; but you can"
714,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"try this once, and I hope it may be as you say. But you must remember"
715,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"that your uncle is very strict, and that you will not be allowed""--"
716,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
717,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Oh, I know!"" said Tom, but his father stopped him."
718,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
719,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""If you say that to me again I shall not let you go to your uncle's. If"
720,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"you know so well, you ought to practise what you know, and give less"
721,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"anxiety to your mother and me."""
722,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
723,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"At last the day came. His father saw him off at the station; and, after"
724,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"a journey of two hours, Tom arrived at the Felford station, and found"
725,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"his uncle's wagon had come to meet him, and Allan was in it. The boys"
726,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"had much to say to each other; for they had not met for some months, and"
727,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"were always good friends, Allan being only eight months younger than"
728,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,Tom. Allan had much to tell of their plans for enjoyment while Tom was
729,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"at Felford, and among other pleasant things, there was to be a village"
730,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"cricket match, in which Allan was to play."
731,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
732,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""And you, too, Tom,"" he said, for he never doubted his cousin's powers."
733,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""It won't be a very grand match, you see, but it will be capital fun,"
734,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"and the boys play""--"
735,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
736,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Oh, I know!"" said Tom."
737,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
738,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""All right: that will be capital,"" said Allan; and Tom, who had never"
739,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"held a bat in his life, found himself engaged to play in the match."
740,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
741,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""But I shall find it quite easy,"" he thought. ""I've seen it played, and"
742,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"the boys at school seem to find it simple enough."""
743,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
744,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"His uncle was out riding when Tom reached Felford, having had business"
745,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"to attend to, so the boys at once went out into the garden and inspected"
746,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,the scene of the future cricket match.
747,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
748,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Tom looked at it a moment, then visions of Lords came before him, and he"
749,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"said decidedly, ""It wants rolling dreadfully!"""
750,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
751,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Father said it was too dry to roll,"" said Allan, in rather a melancholy"
752,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"tone. ""You see, if""--"
753,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
754,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Oh, I know!"" interrupted Tom; ""but we might try to roll it ourselves,"
755,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"don't you know. That would be fun, and it would surprise him. Is there a"
756,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"roller anywhere?"""
757,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
758,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Yes, the small garden-roller; but Father said""--"
759,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
760,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Oh, I know!"" said Tom impatiently. ""Let us fetch it."""
761,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
762,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,Allan said no more. It was clear that Tom did not intend to listen to
763,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,anything he had to say.
764,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
765,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Do you know how to use the roller?"" asked Allan."
766,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
767,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""I should hope so! Any one must know that,"" said Tom; and away they went"
768,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,to fetch it.
769,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
770,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Now, there is a right way and a wrong way to do everything, and a"
771,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"garden-roller should be _pulled_ and not _pushed_, but this Tom did not"
772,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"understand; therefore, he set to work with Allan to push the roller"
773,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"through the garden towards the field, while Twinkle, the fox-terrier,"
774,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,followed at their heels.
775,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
776,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,A garden-roller is an awkward thing to manage if you don't understand
777,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"it. The iron handle is heavily weighted, and if pressed down and then"
778,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"released it springs up with great force, owing to the weight with which"
779,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,it is balanced.
780,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
781,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,Tom knew nothing of this; and Allan had never been allowed to touch the
782,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"roller, so he was as ignorant as Tom. They had paused to draw breath,"
783,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"when Twinkle's bark of delight made Allan exclaim, ""There's Father!"""
784,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
785,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,At that moment Tom took his arms off the iron handle on which they had
786,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"been resting, and the handle sprang up. There was a cry from Allan, and"
787,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,Tom saw to his horror that one end of the iron bar had struck the boy
788,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"just above the eye. It was a painful blow, and the bruise began at once"
789,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"to discolor and swell, so that by the time his father came up poor Allan"
790,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,was a piteous object.
791,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
792,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,It was a most unfortunate beginning to Tom's visit. Of course his uncle
793,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"was angry, for the garden-roller was quite useless for the purpose of"
794,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"rolling the field, and the ground was so hard and dry that no rolling,"
795,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"even with the heaviest horse-roller, would have done any good. Allan"
796,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"was very sorry for Tom, and took more than a fair share of the blame,"
797,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,saying he ought to have been more careful; but he was rather distressed
798,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"when he found that he had a black eye, and that it could not be well"
799,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"before the cricket match, when the boys would be sure to chaff him."
800,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
801,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,This exploit of Tom's and his uncle's anger made the boy more careful;
802,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"and all went well until the day before the cricket match, when Tom and"
803,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,Allan went out for a private practice in the field.
804,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
805,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""You aren't standing right. Your leg's before the wicket,"" said Allan,"
806,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"as Tom stood ready, bat in hand, to receive the ball."
807,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
808,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Oh, I know! but it's only for practice,"" said Tom quickly. ""Send me the"
809,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"ball."""
810,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
811,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Allan bowled, Tom hit, the ball spun straight up in the air and came"
812,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,down almost at Tom's feet.
813,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
814,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"""Hullo!"" said Allan, pointing to the stumps; ""how did you do that?"""
815,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
816,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,Tom looked round and found he had knocked over the stumps. This slight
817,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"mistake having been set right, Tom was ready to start again. This time,"
818,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"as the ball spun off his bat, there was a crash, and Allan exclaimed in"
819,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"horror, ""Oh, Father's precious orchids!"" for the ball had gone through"
820,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"the glass of the small greenhouse, and had overturned and injured"
821,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,several cherished plants.
822,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
823,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"Poor Tom thought he had had enough of cricket for that day, and went in"
824,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,to make his confession to his uncle. Allan's piteous face did more
825,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"towards softening his father than Tom's regrets, and he said very"
826,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"little about the matter, though possibly he felt the more."
827,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
828,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,The next day the cricket match came off. Tom very soon found that in
829,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,playing it was necessary to have done something more than look on. He
830,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"knew little or nothing of the rules of the game, and brought disgrace on"
831,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"himself, and on his cousin for having introduced so bad a player into"
832,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,the village eleven. Had there been any one to take his place he would
833,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"have been turned out in spite of anything Allan could say, but as it was"
834,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,they were obliged to put up with him.
835,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
836,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"When Tom went in, his first action was to put himself out, amid the"
837,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,hootings of fury and amusement of the rest of the party. Even Allan was
838,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,getting cross with him.
839,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
840,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"When the other side went in again, Tom made more effort to follow the"
841,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"game and catch the ball; but he knew nothing of cricket, and was wearing"
842,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"his ordinary walking-boots. The grass was dry and slippery, and Tom was"
843,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"clumsy. He was chasing the ball, and thought he should really succeed in"
844,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"catching it this time, when his foot slipped and he fell heavily on the"
845,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,grass. He had broken his leg!
846,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,
847,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,The boys who had laughed before were now full of sympathy. He was at
848,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,once taken into the house and the doctor sent for. What poor Tom
849,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"suffered for the rest of that day and all the night, only those who have"
850,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,"broken a leg can tell, and added to his pain was the feeling that he had"
851,A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE.,shown all Allan's friends what a boastful fellow he was.

903,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"saying, ""Yes, Stevie, they are yours, your very own, and grandpa sent"

905,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"sweet-smelling leather case it was, lined with purple velvet, and inside"

907,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"really _cut_. His first knife and fork! Oh, how Stevie had longed for"

910,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,
911,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"""Stevie must learn to handle them nicely, ready to show grandpa when he"

914,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"down to the plate, and then little fingers won't be cut."""
915,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,
916,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"""All alone by myself, mother? all alone by myself?"" cried Stevie"
917,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"eagerly; but mother stood beside him till the pie was cut up, and the"
918,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,pretty knife and fork had been laid aside to be washed and put back in
919,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,their velvet case.
920,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,
921,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"Stevie learned to handle his knife and fork quite nicely in a few days,"
922,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,but he found it rather hard that he was never allowed to have them to
923,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,play with. He used them at the table and that was all. The day grandpa
924,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,came Stevie was all excitement to show him how well he could use his
925,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"beautiful present. Mother had gone to the station to meet him, and it"
926,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,seemed that the long morning of waiting would never be over. But twelve
927,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"o'clock came at last, and nurse gave Stevie a biscuit and an apple, and"
928,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,sent him out in the garden so that he should not disturb baby's nap. He
929,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,ran away down to the fountain and began to play dinner. Then he thought
930,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"of his dear knife and fork. He knew just where they were, but he had"
931,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"been told never to touch them. He did want them so much, and they _were_"
932,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,his own. The apple would seem just like a real dinner if he only had
933,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,them. Stevie ran into the dining-room and mounted the chair by the
934,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"sideboard. For a moment he stopped; for it seemed as if some one said,"
935,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"""Don't touch, Stevie!"" quite loud in his ear, but only the clock went"
936,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"""Tick, tack, tick, tack!"" There was only the little voice of conscience"
937,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"_inside_ Stevie to say ""Don't touch;"" and he wouldn't listen to that, so"
938,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,he ran away with the pretty case in his hand.
939,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,
940,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"Stevie played dinner, and old gray pussy sat on the fountain basin and"
941,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"looked at him. She played grandpa, at least Stevie said so; but somehow"
942,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"the apple didn't taste so sweet as at first, and he cut his thumb a"
943,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"little, and thought he would put the knife and fork back. Back in their"
944,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"case he did put them, clip went the little silver fastening, Pussy"
945,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"arched her back and swelled her tail, for the dog belonging to the baker"
946,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,had just come through the gate with his master. There was a rush and a
947,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"tussle, and the baker ran to Stevie; but something had gone splash! into"
948,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"the fountain, and Stevie ran away crying. How everybody did _hunt_ for"
949,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"that knife and fork, while Stevie sat very pale and quiet, holding one"
950,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,fat thumb hidden by his hand.
951,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,
952,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"Grandpa sat next to the high-chair. ""Cheer up, little man: it will be"

956,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,
957,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"Stevie's thumb hurt him, and he felt so miserable that he couldn't bear"

960,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,
961,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,Mother took him on her lap till she had made out what had happened. Then

963,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"and fished up the knife and fork. Stevie ate his dinner with a spoon,"
964,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,for grandpa said he thought the knife and fork had better go away till
965,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,"the poor thumb was well. The pretty case was quite, _quite_ spoiled. But"
966,HIS FIRST KNIFE AND FORK.,Stevie got his knife and fork back; and we noticed that we didn't have

1035,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,see her. A few months ago there would have been no difficulty about the
1036,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"journey; but the Everests had lost a great deal of money lately, and an"
1037,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"expensive journey was now quite out of the question, and yet it cut her"
1038,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"to the heart not to be able to go to her mother when she was ill, and"
1039,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,perhaps dying.
1040,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1041,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"Vera was too young to be told all this, but she was not too young to see"
1042,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,that Mother was in trouble.
1043,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1044,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"""I do believe Santa Claus forgot Mammy's stocking,"" she said to herself:"
1045,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"""she has not had a present to-day, and that's why she's crying."""
1046,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1047,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"So Vera turned the matter over in her mind, and came to the conclusion"
1048,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"that _she_ must give Mother a present, as Santa Claus had so shamefully"
1049,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,neglected her.
1050,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1051,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,She went to her treasure-box--a tin biscuit-case in which she kept the
1052,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"pretty stones and crystals which she picked up in her walks, and, after"
1053,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"thinking a little, she chose a bright, irregular-shaped stone, and,"
1054,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"clasping her hands tightly behind her, she went on to the veranda."
1055,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1056,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,Mother was lying back in a cane chair and gazing with sad eyes over the
1057,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,sea.
1058,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1059,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"""I've brought you a Christmas present, Mother,"" said Vera. ""Don't cry"
1060,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"any more, but guess what it is."""
1061,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1062,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,Mrs. Everest turned round and smiled lovingly at her child. Certainly
1063,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,little Vera made a pleasant picture for a mother's eyes to dwell upon as
1064,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"she stood there roguishly smiling in her cool white frock and blue sash,"
1065,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"and a coral necklace on her fat neck, whilst her golden hair shone like"
1066,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,a halo round her head.
1067,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1068,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"""Guess, Mother dear,"" repeated Vera; then, unable to wait, she jumped on"
1069,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"Mrs. Everest's lap, and, opening her little pink hands, she displayed"
1070,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"the stone. ""It's your Christmas present!"" she declared."
1071,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1072,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"Mrs. Everest kissed the child, but did not, so thought Vera, take enough"
1073,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,notice of her handsome gift.
1074,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1075,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"""It shines, doesn't it, Father?"" she said, holding it up for Mr."
1076,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,Everest's inspection as he passed along the veranda.
1077,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1078,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"Mr. Everest stopped, took the stone in his hand, then, turning deadly"
1079,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"pale, he walked quickly into the house without saying a word. Vera felt"
1080,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,the world was somewhat disappointing to-day; but in a minute or two her
1081,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"father reappeared, and hastily encircling both wife and child with his"
1082,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"arm, he said gayly, ""There, Sophy! kiss your little daughter, and"
1083,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"congratulate her. She has made your fortune, and you can leave for home"
1084,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"to-morrow, and engage a state cabin if you like."""
1085,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1086,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"""O Henry! what do you mean?"" said the bewildered Mrs. Everest."
1087,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1088,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"""Just what I say!"" he declared. ""Vera's gift to you is a diamond; and if"
1089,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"I know anything, it will sell in Capetown for a good round sum. So don't"
1090,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"fret any more, little woman, but pack up your traps and take your clever"
1091,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"daughter with you, and we will start for Capetown to-night, so as to"
1092,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"catch the first steamer for home."""
1093,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1094,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"Vera could not now think that her present was not enough appreciated,"
1095,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,for Father would not let it out of his hand until he got to the
1096,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"jeweller's at Capetown, and had sold it for a large sum of money."
1097,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1098,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"Vera and her mother sailed the very next day, and Grandma got better"
1099,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"from the hour of their arrival. As for Mother, she was now always"
1100,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,"smiling; for with Grandma well, and no debts to worry her, she felt so"
1101,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,happy that she seemed hardly to know how to be grateful enough.
1102,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,
1103,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,Certainly there could not have been a more opportune present than Vera's
1104,VERA'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.,Christmas Gift.

1108,TOMMY TORMENT.,TOMMY TORMENT.
1109,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1110,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1111,TOMMY TORMENT.,"We all called him in private ""Tommy Torment;"" but his mother called him"
1112,TOMMY TORMENT.,"""My precious darling,"" and ""My sweet, good boy,"" and spoiled him in a"
1113,TOMMY TORMENT.,"truly dreadful way. Anyhow, he was not a nice boy, and we never saw more"
1114,TOMMY TORMENT.,of him than we could help.
1115,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1116,TOMMY TORMENT.,"He did not go to school even, for this seven-year-old boy was thought"
1117,TOMMY TORMENT.,"too delicate, and was taught at home by a governess with sandy curls,"
1118,TOMMY TORMENT.,who brought books in a needlework bag that we all used to laugh at--I am
1119,TOMMY TORMENT.,"sure I don't know why; but her teaching could not have amounted to much,"
1120,TOMMY TORMENT.,"for I went into the schoolroom one day, and found Tommy riding defiantly"
1121,TOMMY TORMENT.,"on the rocking-horse, while poor Miss Feechim stood by him with an A B C"
1122,TOMMY TORMENT.,"in one hand and a long pointer in the other, with which she showed him"
1123,TOMMY TORMENT.,"the letters. When he said them correctly, Miss Feechim gave him a"
1124,TOMMY TORMENT.,"sugar-plum out of the bag on her arm, but when he refused to look at"
1125,TOMMY TORMENT.,"them, which he did as often as not, she only said, ""Oh, Tommy!"" and"
1126,TOMMY TORMENT.,"shook her curls, and never attempted to make him mind her; and then he"
1127,TOMMY TORMENT.,"laughed and called her names, and rocked his horse so violently up and"
1128,TOMMY TORMENT.,down that his poor mother came rushing up-stairs white with anxiety to
1129,TOMMY TORMENT.,know what was the matter.
1130,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1131,TOMMY TORMENT.,You can imagine after this we were not overjoyed when we heard from
1132,TOMMY TORMENT.,"Mother that Lady Mary was so ill her mother had taken possession of her,"
1133,TOMMY TORMENT.,and that we were to have the pleasure of Tommy Torment's company at the
1134,TOMMY TORMENT.,"seaside. Mother said she was very sorry, but she could not help it. The"
1135,TOMMY TORMENT.,"doctor said Lady Mary must have complete rest, and no worries; and Lady"
1136,TOMMY TORMENT.,Mary had said she could not trust her precious treasure to any one else
1137,TOMMY TORMENT.,"but Mother. So, when we set off on our annual holiday, Tommy was stuck"
1138,TOMMY TORMENT.,into a corner of the omnibus.
1139,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1140,TOMMY TORMENT.,"Well, at first, and under Mother's eye, we really did think we had been"
1141,TOMMY TORMENT.,"rather hard on Tommy Torment, he seemed so like other boys; but"
1142,TOMMY TORMENT.,"presently, when the novelty had worn off, and he had become tired of"
1143,TOMMY TORMENT.,"being good, the real Tommy appeared, and for at least a week we had"
1144,TOMMY TORMENT.,"really what Nurse calls a ""regular time of it."" There was not a trick he"
1145,TOMMY TORMENT.,"did not know; and the worst of it was that our boys became tricky too,"
1146,TOMMY TORMENT.,"and we really did not know how to bear the rough usage we all received,"
1147,TOMMY TORMENT.,for we never had a moment's pleasure or peace of our lives; and what
1148,TOMMY TORMENT.,"with sand in our hair, wet star-fish down our backs, and seeing our"
1149,TOMMY TORMENT.,"dolls shipwrecked in their best clothes off the steepest possible rocks,"
1150,TOMMY TORMENT.,"we never felt secure for a moment, and we actually began to wish"
1151,TOMMY TORMENT.,"ourselves back in the city, when Nurse fortunately rose to the occasion,"
1152,TOMMY TORMENT.,"and, taking the law into her own hands, escorted the whole party up to"
1153,TOMMY TORMENT.,"Mother, which brought matters to a climax; for our boys were so ashamed"
1154,TOMMY TORMENT.,of their cruelty and ungentlemanly behavior when Mother explained to
1155,TOMMY TORMENT.,"them what their tricks really meant, that they became their own true"
1156,TOMMY TORMENT.,"selves, and we had the first good play together of the season the next"
1157,TOMMY TORMENT.,"morning on the shore, though Tommy did his best to bother us, and to"
1158,TOMMY TORMENT.,draw off the boys again by promising to show them quite a new way of
1159,TOMMY TORMENT.,managing a shipwreck.
1160,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1161,TOMMY TORMENT.,"But the boys would not join Tommy, and so he went off alone, and we saw"
1162,TOMMY TORMENT.,"him five minutes after with Yellowboy, the sandy kitten, tied to the"
1163,TOMMY TORMENT.,"mast of his ship, doing his very best to drown the poor little thing,"
1164,TOMMY TORMENT.,pretending he was rescuing it from the perils of the ocean.
1165,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1166,TOMMY TORMENT.,I could fill pages were I to go on telling you only of Tommy's tricks;
1167,TOMMY TORMENT.,"but as that cannot be, I am just going to let you know how we cured him."
1168,TOMMY TORMENT.,"We simply let him alone. Mother only scolded him, or rather talked to"
1169,TOMMY TORMENT.,"him, once, and that seemed to have no effect on him at all, though"
1170,TOMMY TORMENT.,"Mother's ""talkings"" usually soften the hardest heart; so finally we all"
1171,TOMMY TORMENT.,"agreed to go our own ways just as if he were not there, Nurse promising"
1172,TOMMY TORMENT.,"to put all our toys and pets out of his reach, and to see that he came"
1173,TOMMY TORMENT.,to no real harm.
1174,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1175,TOMMY TORMENT.,He actually bore a whole week of it before he repented. We used to watch
1176,TOMMY TORMENT.,"him from the corners of our eyes moping all by himself, and looking at"
1177,TOMMY TORMENT.,"the toes of his boots, or at his ship, which he really could not sail"
1178,TOMMY TORMENT.,"without our help, and felt so sorry for him. We longed to break our"
1179,TOMMY TORMENT.,"resolution; but Mother and Nurse helped us to keep firm, and one Monday"
1180,TOMMY TORMENT.,"morning Tommy came up to me and said, ""Why won't you play with me,"
1181,TOMMY TORMENT.,"Hilda?"""
1182,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1183,TOMMY TORMENT.,"""Because you are cruel and ungentlemanly,"" I said seriously, ""and"
1184,TOMMY TORMENT.,"because you are selfish. We tried our best to be pleasant to you, though"
1185,TOMMY TORMENT.,"we never wanted you here, and in return you made the boys horrid to us,"
1186,TOMMY TORMENT.,and never allowed us five minutes' peace. You spoiled a whole week of
1187,TOMMY TORMENT.,"our precious holidays, and we can't afford to waste any more time over"
1188,TOMMY TORMENT.,"you. We can do without you perfectly well, and so please go away."""
1189,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1190,TOMMY TORMENT.,"""But I am truly sorry, Hilda,"" he said, looking down. ""I've been"
1191,TOMMY TORMENT.,"'flecting"" (he meant reflecting). ""I'd much rather be agreeable and"
1192,TOMMY TORMENT.,"nice, and I won't be selfish if you'd not look away from me and forget"
1193,TOMMY TORMENT.,"me any more. If I'd your mother I'd be good perhaps, but I really think"
1194,TOMMY TORMENT.,"my mother doesn't understand boys."" And he sighed deeply, and put his"
1195,TOMMY TORMENT.,hands into his knickerbocker pockets.
1196,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1197,TOMMY TORMENT.,"""You'll not forget, and tease us again?"" I asked firmly; ""and you know I"
1198,TOMMY TORMENT.,"must ask Mother too."""
1199,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1200,TOMMY TORMENT.,"""I'll promise, really,"" said Tommy, giving me a very grubby little hand;"
1201,TOMMY TORMENT.,"""only please do look at me as you look at Charley, and don't leave me"
1202,TOMMY TORMENT.,"all to myself again. I do get so tired of myself, you can't think."""
1203,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1204,TOMMY TORMENT.,"I could, for once I had been left alone just in the same way; but I"
1205,TOMMY TORMENT.,"didn't tell Tommy this, and only went to Mother, and soon he was playing"
1206,TOMMY TORMENT.,"quite happily with us, and remained such a good boy. Nurse used to look"
1207,TOMMY TORMENT.,"out for spots on his chest every day when she bathed him, for she was"
1208,TOMMY TORMENT.,"quite sure that he must be going to be ill, but he wasn't; and he"
1209,TOMMY TORMENT.,"remained so good we were quite sorry to part with him, for he was really"
1210,TOMMY TORMENT.,"funny, and full of life. But as his mother kept very weak, Tommy was"
1211,TOMMY TORMENT.,"sent to school; and so, when we went back from the seaside, after the"
1212,TOMMY TORMENT.,"holidays were over, we did not meet again for nearly a year."
1213,TOMMY TORMENT.,
1214,TOMMY TORMENT.,"When we did meet, we hardly knew him again, he was such a jolly little"
1215,TOMMY TORMENT.,"fellow. And when he grew confidential, which he did the third day of the"
1216,TOMMY TORMENT.,"holidays, he said to me very solemnly, ""I say, Hilda, if any little boys"
1217,TOMMY TORMENT.,"and girls are as rude and naughty as I used to be once, I know how to"
1218,TOMMY TORMENT.,"cure them. I shall first talk to them nicely, as your mother talked to"
1219,TOMMY TORMENT.,"me, and then I shall let them alone. It cured me, I know. You don't ever"
1220,TOMMY TORMENT.,"call me Tommy Torment now, do you, Hilda?"""

1225,THE TRICYCLE.,
1226,THE TRICYCLE.,
1227,THE TRICYCLE.,My grandfather does give me nice things! Last birthday he gave me a
1228,THE TRICYCLE.,"lovely box of tools, and he gave me the rocking-horse when I was quite"
1229,THE TRICYCLE.,"little, and the swing trapeze that hangs from the nursery ceiling, and"
1230,THE TRICYCLE.,"books and toys,--I can't remember them all now. But his last present was"
1231,THE TRICYCLE.,best of all: it was a tricycle!
1232,THE TRICYCLE.,
1233,THE TRICYCLE.,"I was nine last birthday, and I couldn't help wondering--though it"
1234,THE TRICYCLE.,"sounds rather greedy--what grandfather would give me, because I thought"
1235,THE TRICYCLE.,"it wouldn't be a toy, and he had given me a book at Christmas, for he"
1236,THE TRICYCLE.,"said I was growing ""quite a man."""
1237,THE TRICYCLE.,
1238,THE TRICYCLE.,"When the birthday morning came, and I ran down to breakfast, there was"
1239,THE TRICYCLE.,nothing at all from grandfather! I'm afraid I looked very disappointed
1240,THE TRICYCLE.,"just at first; but presently we heard a little noise outside, and there"
1241,THE TRICYCLE.,"was grandfather himself, and a man with him, who was wheeling the"
1242,THE TRICYCLE.,dearest little tricycle you ever saw.
1243,THE TRICYCLE.,
1244,THE TRICYCLE.,"It was rather hard work at first, and I soon got tired; but now I can go"
1245,THE TRICYCLE.,"ten miles with father, and not feel at all tired."
1246,THE TRICYCLE.,
1247,THE TRICYCLE.,I'll tell you one thing that makes me so glad about my tricycle. I was
1248,THE TRICYCLE.,"just going out on it one morning, when mother came running out of the"
1249,THE TRICYCLE.,"house, looking so pale and frightened that I was quite frightened too."
1250,THE TRICYCLE.,
1251,THE TRICYCLE.,"""Bertie,"" she said, ""tell John to go at once to Dr. Bell's and ask him"
1252,THE TRICYCLE.,"to come here at once--_at once_, remember. Your father has cut his hand"
1253,THE TRICYCLE.,"very badly, and we can't stop the bleeding."""
1254,THE TRICYCLE.,
1255,THE TRICYCLE.,"""I'll go, mother; let me go on the tricycle,"" I said."
1256,THE TRICYCLE.,
1257,THE TRICYCLE.,"And she answered, ""Do, dear; only make haste!"""
1258,THE TRICYCLE.,
1259,THE TRICYCLE.,"I don't think I ever went so fast before; but it was a good road, and"
1260,THE TRICYCLE.,"that helped me, and I was saying to myself all the time, ""Oh, don't let"
1261,THE TRICYCLE.,me be too late for the doctor! _Please_ let me find him and bring him to
1262,THE TRICYCLE.,"father."""
1263,THE TRICYCLE.,
1264,THE TRICYCLE.,"And I _did_ find the doctor at home. I was out of breath, but I managed"
1265,THE TRICYCLE.,"to tell him what was the matter, and he was soon ready."
1266,THE TRICYCLE.,
1267,THE TRICYCLE.,"Of course I couldn't keep up with his pony-cart, as father could have"
1268,THE TRICYCLE.,"done, but I got home not long after, and heard that the doctor was"
1269,THE TRICYCLE.,"there, and the bleeding had stopped."
1270,THE TRICYCLE.,
1271,THE TRICYCLE.,"Father was very weak for some time, and his hand was not well for"
1272,THE TRICYCLE.,"several weeks, but the doctor and mother said he would have died if I"
1273,THE TRICYCLE.,hadn't been able to fetch the doctor so quickly on my tricycle.
1274,THE TRICYCLE.,
1275,THE TRICYCLE.,"That's why I like my tricycle so much, and think it such a useful thing."
1276,THE TRICYCLE.,"If it had been a pony, it would have had to be saddled and bridled; but"
1277,THE TRICYCLE.,"I always keep it cleaned and oiled, so it was quite ready for use when"
1278,THE TRICYCLE.,it was wanted. Mother used to be rather afraid of my riding it at one
1279,THE TRICYCLE.,"time, but she doesn't mind it now, because she knows how useful it was"

1976,A VISIT TO NURSE.,brought some round to all the wounded men he could find. That hot tea

2064,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Jimmie and Daisy, and Baby Dot were all staying for their holidays at"
2065,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"pleasant Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, and a fine time they were"
2066,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,having. The mornings were spent in building castles and digging wells on
2067,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"the broad, yellow sands, and, when not _too_ hot, the afternoons"
2068,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,frequently passed in like manner; while in the cool sun-setting time
2069,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"after tea, their father always took them for a nice walk over the cliffs"
2070,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"to Shanklin, or along the country lanes to Yaverland, or away to some"
2071,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,lovely inland meadow where they could pick big white marguerites and
2072,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,golden buttercups as many as their hands could hold.
2073,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,
2074,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,One morning Daisy was busily looking for nice pieces of seaweed and
2075,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"pretty little stones to ornament a grotto she and Jimmie had built, when"

2092,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"""Oh, Jimmie, it won't like that!"" cried Daisy, in real anxiety. ""It"

2102,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,
2103,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Jimmie, however, lest he should lose his prize, caught it up in a"
2104,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"twinkling, and stuffed it in his pocket. ""You go there!"" he said. ""And"

2107,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Daisy's distress was evident, and tears were gathering in her blue eyes;"
2108,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"for she knew that everything which has life has feeling too, and she"
2109,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"could not bear to have even a baby crab made uncomfortable. But Jimmie,"
2110,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"I am sorry to say, was not so tender over her, nor enough of a man to"
2111,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"give up his own way in a little thing to make his sister happy. So, in"
2112,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"spite of her entreaties, poor wee crabbie was condemned to durance vile"
2113,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"in the hot and stifling pocket of Jimmie's knickerbockers, and Daisy had"
2114,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,a sorry spot in her heart for the rest of the morning.
2115,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,
2116,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,When the children went indoors they found that their favorite uncle had
2117,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"arrived from London, and was proposing an early dinner, and a trip to"
2118,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Carisbrooke. In the pleasant excitement which this caused, everything"
2119,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"else was forgotten. Even when Jimmie's suit was changed, he never gave"
2120,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,one thought to the captive crab.
2121,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,
2122,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Their excursion to the old castle proved delightful. Jimmie, who had"
2123,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"only got as far as Richard II. in his history-book, and was not very"
2124,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"fond of learning, became quite eager to get on fast, and come to the"
2125,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"place where it told about King Charles and his imprisonment, and how he"
2126,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,tried to get out of the tiny window shown them by the guide. Somebody
2127,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"remarked that ""Liberty is sweet,"" and Jimmie remembered writing the very"
2128,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,same in his copy-book; but it did not occur to him to consider that it
2129,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"is just as sweet in its way, to a little, sea-loving crablet as to a"
2130,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,king.
2131,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,
2132,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,It must have been the unusual state of excitement in which Jimmie went
2133,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,to bed that night that caused the events of the day to become oddly
2134,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"mixed up in a horrible dream. He thought _he_ was a prisoner, not in a"
2135,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"castle, but in the sand grotto which he and Daisy had been making in the"
2136,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"morning, and that his jailor was a giant crab! A tiny hole in the side"
2137,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"of the grotto, about two inches square, was his only way of escape, and"
2138,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"unless he could manage to squeeze himself through that, he would be"
2139,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,crushed to death by a pair of great claws as thick as a man's body.
2140,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Nearer and nearer they came, harder and harder he struggled, and gurgled"
2141,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,and gasped. No wonder that at last his cries aroused his mother in the
2142,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"next room, and that she came running to see what was the matter!"
2143,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,
2144,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"""Oh, that awful crab! Save me, save me! Oh--oh--oh!"" yelled Jimmie, only"
2145,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,half awake. And then to his increased horror he found that his dream was
2146,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"at least partly real, and that his own escaped prisoner was crawling"
2147,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,briskly over his pillow in the evident hope of finding the ocean
2148,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,somewhere down on the other side. Having the creature come upon him like
2149,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"that when he least expected it, and immediately after such a dream,"
2150,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Jimmie fairly screamed with fright, and wouldn't lie down in bed again"
2151,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"until Daisy, who had been awakened by the commotion from a lovely dream"
2152,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"about the dear Carisbrooke donkey who works at the well, came and"
2153,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"fetched the wandering crustacean away, and put it among a lot of damp"
2154,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"seaweed in her tin pail, where it seemed very glad to stay."
2155,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,
2156,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"First thing in the morning, before breakfast, Jimmie carried the poor"
2157,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"little creature down to the shore, and left it at the edge of the waves."
2158,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"Moreover, he could not help thinking it very sweet of Daisy that she"
2159,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"never once said, ""Served you right,"" and he privately made up his mind"
2160,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,"that another time if she very much wanted him not to do a thing, he"
2161,JIMMIE'S NIGHTMARE.,wouldn't do it.

2206,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,In the same barn dwelt two cats. One night they found the door of the
2207,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,neighboring pantry open and both walked in. They feasted on roast
2208,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"chicken and cream, but were not satisfied, and so they agreed to carry"
2209,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"away a large piece of cheese. Their plan was executed, and they dragged"
2210,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,the cheese to the barn. Next morning a dispute arose between them
2211,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"concerning the dividing of it. Each claimed it, and their voices awoke"
2212,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"the cook, who, to her horror, found that she had been robbed during the"
2213,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"night, and she declared that she would kill every cat in the"
2214,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"neighborhood. Thus the innocent are often condemned because, in name or"
2215,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"employment, they are associated with the bad. One is known by the"
2216,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"company he keeps; hence, the society of the bad should be shunned."
2217,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2218,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,The cats' quarrel in the barn was long and loud. Each one tried to argue
2219,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"his case in his own interest, and they thus drawled out their arguments."
2220,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2221,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"""Know you the law?"" said one, with a prolonged and emphatic howl at the"
2222,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"word ""law."""

2227,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"""'Tis mine!"" howled the first."
2228,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2229,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"""You lie!"" drawled the other, and then asked in the same tone loud and"
2230,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,emphatic:--
2231,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2232,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"""Who made the law?"" and the first replied in a prolonged undertone."
2233,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2234,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"""Who broke the law?"" he then asked, to which they both sharply replied,"
2235,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"and clinched in a rough fight, screaming, ""You an' I, you an' I! Spit!"
2236,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"spit! Meow! meow!"" and there was a roll and tumble, and scratch, and a"
2237,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"howl, and the air was filled with dust and flying fur."
2238,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2239,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"When their fight was over both were scratched and bruised and sore, and"
2240,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"blood oozed from their wounded ears. Each felt ashamed of himself, and"
2241,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"stole away and hid in the hay-mow, and spent the forenoon smoothing out"
2242,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,his ruffled fur and dressing his aching wounds.
2243,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2244,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,The next day they met again and decided to leave their case to Judge
2245,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"Jacko, a venerable monkey, who lived in the adjoining shed. Judge Jacko"
2246,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"was an African by birth, but in early life he was stolen by a wicked"
2247,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,sailor from the land of palms and cocoanuts and sold into slavery to a
2248,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"travelling showman, with whom he wandered over many countries and"
2249,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,learned the manners and customs of the people. He was a careful observer
2250,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"of all he saw done, and hence he acquired a great amount of information."
2251,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,Those who would learn rapidly should be careful observers of all that
2252,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,goes on around them; knowledge obtained by observation is generally of
2253,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,more value than that obtained from books.
2254,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2255,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,When Jacko had become advanced in years he was fortunate enough to have
2256,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"a permanent home with his master, who had also retired from the"
2257,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,travelling show business. In his quiet home he had a chance to meditate
2258,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"on what he had learned, and he became so wise that everybody called him"
2259,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,Judge Jacko.
2260,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2261,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"When the cats presented their case, he put on his wig and spectacles as"
2262,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"emblems of his judgeship, and procured the pantry scales in which to"
2263,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,weigh the cheese. They sat quietly down before him and anxiously awaited
2264,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,his decision.
2265,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2266,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,He broke the cheese in two parts and placed a lump in each end of the
2267,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,scale.
2268,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,
2269,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"""This lump outweighs the other,"" said he, ""justice must be done. I will"
2270,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"bite off enough to make them equal,"" and so he took the lump out and"
2271,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"nibbled at it a long time, and when he put it in the scale the opposite"
2272,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,end was the heavier; and he took out that lump and bit off a large piece
2273,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"to make it equal to the other. Thus he continued to eat, first one and"
2274,JUDGE JACKO AND THE CATS.,"then the other, till the cats saw but little would be left for them, and"

2347,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Charlie never could wait. It was no use telling him ""more haste less"
2348,HASTY CHARLIE.,"speed,"" ""slow and sure,"" or anything of that kind. You might as well"
2349,HASTY CHARLIE.,"talk to the winds. He scrambled up in the morning, scurried over the"
2350,HASTY CHARLIE.,"parts of his toilet that he was trusted to do for himself, hurried over"
2351,HASTY CHARLIE.,"his breakfast, rushed through his lessons, with many mistakes of course,"
2352,HASTY CHARLIE.,"and by his hasty, impatient behavior worried his quiet, gentle little"
2353,HASTY CHARLIE.,"sister Ethel nearly out of her wits, and almost drove patient Miss"
2354,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Smith, the governess, to despair. He burnt his mouth with hot food,"
2355,HASTY CHARLIE.,"because he couldn't wait for it to cool; fell down-stairs, racing down,"
2356,HASTY CHARLIE.,times out of number; his toys were always getting broken because he
2357,HASTY CHARLIE.,"couldn't stop to put them away; his canary flew away because he, fuming"
2358,HASTY CHARLIE.,"with impatience about something, neglected to fasten the cage door one"
2359,HASTY CHARLIE.,day; and indeed space would fail to tell of all the troubles he brought
2360,HASTY CHARLIE.,"upon himself by his perpetual, heedless haste."
2361,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2362,HASTY CHARLIE.,There were some exceptions to this general state of things. He didn't
2363,HASTY CHARLIE.,"hurry to begin his lessons,--nor to go to bed. Here he would wait as"
2364,HASTY CHARLIE.,"long as you liked to let him. One thing he was obliged to wait for,"
2365,HASTY CHARLIE.,"sorely against his will, and that was to grow up. It did take such a"
2366,HASTY CHARLIE.,"long time, and oh, the things he meant to do when once he was a man!"
2367,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Father hoped he would alter a great deal before that time came, for, as"
2368,HASTY CHARLIE.,"he told him, a hasty, impatient man makes other people unhappy and"
2369,HASTY CHARLIE.,cannot be happy himself.
2370,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2371,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Charlie meant to have a balloon when he grew up, and a sweet-stuff shop,"
2372,HASTY CHARLIE.,"an elephant, a garden full of apples and plums, a tall black horse, and"
2373,HASTY CHARLIE.,a donkey.
2374,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2375,HASTY CHARLIE.,"""You needn't wait so long for the donkey,"" Father said one day. ""I have"
2376,HASTY CHARLIE.,seen a boy with two nice donkeys in Pine-tree Walk; when you and Ethel
2377,HASTY CHARLIE.,"have been good children at your lessons, Miss Smith shall let you ride"
2378,HASTY CHARLIE.,"them, and when you can ride nicely I will buy you each a donkey of your"
2379,HASTY CHARLIE.,"own."""
2380,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2381,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Lessons certainly went better after this, and the rides were much"
2382,HASTY CHARLIE.,"enjoyed on every fine day, though timid little Ethel was always just a"
2383,HASTY CHARLIE.,wee bit afraid at first starting. Miss Smith always safely mounted Ethel
2384,HASTY CHARLIE.,first.
2385,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2386,HASTY CHARLIE.,"""Wait a minute, Charlie!"" she said one day, when he was pulling and"
2387,HASTY CHARLIE.,"tugging impatiently at Neddie's bridle, ""we'll have you up directly."""
2388,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2389,HASTY CHARLIE.,But Charlie couldn't wait: he dragged the donkey into the road and
2390,HASTY CHARLIE.,scrambled upon its back.
2391,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2392,HASTY CHARLIE.,"""Charlie! Charlie! you mustn't start without us. Wait a minute!"""
2393,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2394,HASTY CHARLIE.,"""I can ride by my own self now,"" he said; and jerking the bridle, off he"
2395,HASTY CHARLIE.,"went clattering down the road, the donkey-boy after him."
2396,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2397,HASTY CHARLIE.,"To mount a donkey is one thing, to manage him another, especially if you"
2398,HASTY CHARLIE.,"don't know how. On galloped Neddie, and after having knocked down a"
2399,HASTY CHARLIE.,"little girl and upset a barrow of fruit, he pitched Charlie over his"
2400,HASTY CHARLIE.,"head, and having thus got rid of his rider began to enjoy himself on the"
2401,HASTY CHARLIE.,grass. Poor Charlie! He had such a bruised face that he was obliged to
2402,HASTY CHARLIE.,stay at home for days.
2403,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2404,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Miss Smith couldn't take him out like that. It hurt him very much, but"
2405,HASTY CHARLIE.,"it hurt him more when Father said that such a silly, impatient boy was"
2406,HASTY CHARLIE.,"not fit to be trusted to ride, and that he must wait a whole year before"
2407,HASTY CHARLIE.,"he could be allowed to mount a donkey again. ""For your own sake,"
2408,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Charlie, and for other people's."""
2409,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2410,HASTY CHARLIE.,The little girl he had knocked down was more frightened than hurt; but
2411,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Charlie was very sorry, for he was not at all an ill-natured boy; and"
2412,HASTY CHARLIE.,"when he was at home by himself, while Ethel went for her donkey-rides,"
2413,HASTY CHARLIE.,"he had plenty of time to think things over, and made a good use of it."
2414,HASTY CHARLIE.,"At first he found it very hard to be patient, but after a little while"
2415,HASTY CHARLIE.,"he found it becoming much easier to wait, and every time he tried it"
2416,HASTY CHARLIE.,became easier still.
2417,HASTY CHARLIE.,
2418,HASTY CHARLIE.,"Next summer, when Father gave him and Ethel the promised donkeys, he"

2432,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"Little Johnnie Strong obediently gathered his books together, and with"
2433,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"an effort to keep back the tears that were filling his eyes, held up his"

2436,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"""Good-by, then, mother dear, and I'll try to be brave and remember what"

2440,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"""That's my brave little man, now; good-by, dearie."" And Johnnie was"
2441,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,gone.
2442,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2443,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,Very often Mrs. Strong and Johnnie had little talks at breakfast-time
2444,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"about his troubles, and he used to say it helped him through the day to"
2445,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,remember his mother's loving words. The conversation with which this
2446,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,story began was the end of one of these talks. It was getting near
2447,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"examination time, and Johnnie had been trying very hard to catch up with"
2448,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,the other boys in his spelling and writing. Sums he could manage now
2449,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"pretty well, and he read very fairly; but it seemed to him he should"
2450,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"_never_ be able to spell properly. ""Thousands of words,"" he would say,"
2451,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"despairingly, ""and no two spelt alike."" However, he went off to school"
2452,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"very bravely, and his determination to do the best he could was a"
2453,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,wonderful help.
2454,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2455,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"He got on very well that morning until the time came for ""dictation,"""
2456,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,and then poor Johnnie's troubles began. He knew there were boys in his
2457,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"class very little better at spelling than he, who copied from their"
2458,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,neighbors whenever a word was given out that they could not spell; but
2459,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"Johnnie was above doing that. It was cheating and deceiving, and he"
2460,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,would rather every word of his exercise were wrong than be a cheat. But
2461,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,that morning he was sorely tempted. He thought there had never been such
2462,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"a hard piece of dictation; and when Jimmy Lane, who sat next to him,"
2463,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"tried to help him by whispering the letters of one very hard word, it"
2464,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,required some courage to ask him to stop.
2465,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2466,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,At the end of the lesson the boys had to pass their books up to the
2467,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"teacher for inspection, and Johnnie's worst fears were realized when his"
2468,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,book came back with ever so many words marked in blue pencil.
2469,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2470,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"While the teacher was finishing marking the exercises, the master's bell"
2471,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"sounded, and the boys were dismissed for a few minutes' run in the"
2472,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,playground; but Johnnie was obliged to stay behind to learn to spell
2473,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,correctly the words he had blundered over. Poor Johnnie! It was very
2474,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"hard for him to have to stay there, trying to fix in his mind the fact"
2475,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"that ""Receive"" is spelt with the E before the I, and ""Believe"" with the"
2476,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"I before the E, while every other boy of the school was outside,"
2477,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,enjoying the games in which he delighted as much as any of them.
2478,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2479,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,Not quite every other boy though. There was one other prisoner besides
2480,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"himself--Will Maynard, and he had to stay behind because he couldn't"
2481,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,always remember to _pay back_ when he _borrowed_! Not that he was by any
2482,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,means dishonest--it was only when he had a subtraction sum to do that he
2483,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,got into this difficulty!
2484,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2485,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"Johnnie and he were not chums, but, somehow, when they had the whole"
2486,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,school to themselves they couldn't sit on forms ten yards apart--it
2487,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,seemed so very unsociable and unfriendly. So Will brought his slate over
2488,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"to Johnnie, and they were soon busily discussing the difficulties of"
2489,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,sums and spelling.
2490,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2491,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"Although Will was a good deal the older, he was not nearly so clever at"
2492,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"sums as Johnnie, and, moreover, he was not too proud to accept the help"
2493,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,that Johnnie rather timidly offered. They soon settled the difference
2494,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"between the various rows of obstinate figures, and Will laid down his"
2495,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"slate with a sigh of relief and a grateful ""Thank you, Johnnie. Now,"" he"
2496,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"continued, ""let's have a go at your spelling."""
2497,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2498,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,By this time they began to feel quite warm friends--for it is wonderful
2499,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,how quickly a little mutual help creates feelings of friendship.
2500,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"Together they went over the mis-spelt words, and, with Will to help and"
2501,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"encourage, Johnnie soon felt quite sure that the spelling of the"
2502,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,particular words of that morning's exercise would never trouble him
2503,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,again.
2504,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2505,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"They had scarcely finished their work when the big school-bell sounded,"
2506,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"and the boys all came trooping in. Will had to go back to his place, but"
2507,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"he left a very light-hearted little boy behind him, for Johnnie and he"
2508,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"had vowed life-long friendship, and sums and spelling seemed to have"
2509,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,lost all their terrors for both of them.
2510,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2511,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,When Johnnie arrived home from school he could talk of nothing but Will
2512,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"Maynard, and Will, for his part, voted Johnnie ""a jolly little chap."""
2513,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"Many a time after that day did they help each other, and when it was"
2514,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"reported after the examination that they had both passed, each declared"
2515,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,he must have failed without the other's help.
2516,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,
2517,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"They are firm friends still, and are likely to remain so; and whenever a"
2518,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"difficulty occurs, in school or out, they always tackle it together;"
2519,JOHNNIE'S DICTATION.,"for, as Johnnie says, ""A difficulty shared is only half a difficulty."""

2765,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,Patty was fifteen when she left home for the first time to pay a visit
2766,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,to her Aunt Martha in London. Patty's home was in the country (for her

2768,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,London. Her father drove her into the market-town very early on the
2769,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"morning of her departure, and as it was a very busy day with him, he was"
2770,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"obliged to leave her in the coach office all by herself, as the London"
2771,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,coach was not expected to start for half an hour. Patty kissed her
2772,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"father with tears in her eyes, and he blessed her; and telling her to be"
2773,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"a good girl and ""not learn silly town ways,"" he strode off, whip in"
2774,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"hand, towards the market-place, leaving Patty alone with her"

2776,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,
2777,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"They were not many--a leathern trunk that held all her wardrobe, a"

2793,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"dismal gallows, in front. Suddenly the coach stopped, and was surrounded"
2794,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"by three men on horseback, armed with pistols, their faces hidden behind"
2795,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"black crape masks. The ladies screamed, the men turned pale and"
2796,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"trembled, the guard made a faint show of resistance, but was at once"

2800,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"Patty had nothing worth taking--neither watch, jewels, nor money; but"
2801,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"when asked by one of the men what she had, she held out the doll, almost"
2802,AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY.,"hoping that he might take it, but he only laughed loudly. In a short"

2907,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"little girl next me put, 'The rabbit moves his nose when he eats;' and"
2908,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"that was all she wrote. We did so laugh when she had to read it out."""
2909,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2910,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"""A very short essay, certainly,"" said Mrs. Wolf, laughing also; ""still,"
2911,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"it is strictly true, and that is something. But what did my little Lina"
2912,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"write?"""
2913,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2914,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"""I'll show you, mother,"" said Lina; and, with a deep blush on her face,"
2915,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"she drew her slate carefully out of her bag. ""The mistress was pleased"
2916,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"with it, and told me I might show it to you."""
2917,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2918,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"Lina's slate had on it a really spirited little sketch of two rabbits,"
2919,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,and Mrs. Wolf was both surprised and delighted.
2920,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2921,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"""Did you do this, Lina?"" she asked, as she drew the little artist to"
2922,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,her.
2923,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2924,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"""I couldn't think of anything to write,"" said Lina shyly; ""I never can;"
2925,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"so I drew the rabbits instead."""
2926,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2927,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"""My darling,"" said her mother earnestly, ""if you work hard you might one"
2928,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"day be a great artist--I feel sure of it."""
2929,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2930,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,Mrs. Wolf's words came true in after years. Lina is now a well-known
2931,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"painter, and honors not a few have fallen to her share."
2932,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,
2933,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"But that day in the garden, when mother first prophesied that she would"
2934,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"be an artist, is still the day that Lina loves most to recall. ""It was"
2935,A MOTHER'S PROPHECY.,"mother's praise that made an artist of me,"" she always declares."

3051,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,along the road to the copse; a river came running and babbling along by
3052,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"the road, as one neared the copse. Inside the copse the doves were"

3054,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"What would send her back? Not her baby conscience, for Annie had told"

3057,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"At home, the afternoon wore away, tea-time came; nurse ran down from the"

3061,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"""Why, Miss Annie, I thought Dorrie was here!"" cried nurse, in surprise."

3071,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3072,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"Well, they sought the child here, there, and everywhere, little dreaming"

3074,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"by the way of the copse, to look for her. Annie hurried in another"
3075,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"direction, and nurse in yet another. Rover went with Ralph--good Rover,"
3076,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"who could fetch, carry, and find so much. Oh, dear! what a seeking and"
3077,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"searching love makes, when even one wee maiden is lost! Ay, lost--not a"
3078,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"trace of her could Ralph and Rover find, till they came to the babbling"
3079,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"river, and there, on the bank, lay a posy of lilies-of-the-valley, and a"
3080,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,knot of ribbon from Dorrie's shoulder; the river babbled out the rest of
3081,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,the story. Poor Ralph! how he cried now!
3082,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3083,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"""Dorrie! Dorrie!"" he cried, peering down into the shining river, as if"
3084,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,fearful of seeing a sun-bonnet and a gleaming of golden hair in its
3085,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"depths. But no; he saw nothing, only the minnows, the water-spiders, and"
3086,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,the pebbles.
3087,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3088,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"""Lost! Rover, find!"" said he to the dog, showing him Dorrie's"
3089,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,shoulder-knot and the flowers.
3090,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3091,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"Rover seemed to understand, for he sniffed at the ground, and then"
3092,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"bounded into the river, diving down, and no doubt frightening the fishes"
3093,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"as much as he did Ralph. Presently he came out, bringing--ah! what? Mab,"
3094,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"dripping, water-bedabbled--a pitiful object indeed. The boy took her in"
3095,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"his hand, too alarmed to laugh, though fright and fun almost choked him;"
3096,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"then the dog bounded and led the way into the copse, where the doves"
3097,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"still cooed, the squirrels leaped, and the cuckoo cried, as if no small"
3098,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"maiden was lost, perhaps never to be found again alive. The thought made"
3099,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,Ralph shiver.
3100,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3101,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,The river flowed through one corner of the copse; he could see it
3102,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,shining where the sunbeams fell through the tree branches. But Rover did
3103,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,not go that way: he dived away among the trees and undergrowth.
3104,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3105,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"""Dorrie! Dorrie!"" cried the little brother."
3106,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3107,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"""Wow-wow-wow!"" barked Rover, but at first no response."
3108,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,
3109,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"Presently, ""Wow-wow-wow!"" barked Rover again; it was a joyful bark, and"
3110,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"Ralph ran to him. There lay poor tired Dorrie fast asleep, the two"

3112,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"woke her with a pat, Ralph hugged her with such a fond hug; then they"
3113,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"started homeward, Ralph taking the mail-cart, with poor wet Mab mounted"

3117,THE DOLL THAT TAUGHT A LESSON.,"""I left my dollies to go into the copse to pick some flowers, and when I"

3133,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3134,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,And it was more than doubtful; for a sharp shower made the grass and the

3152,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"Miss Peters was a very rich lady, who lived all alone in a beautiful"

3155,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,day. Mrs. Seymour said she would be quite ready at the appointed time;
3156,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,and when they spoke of the weather she told her friend what a

3158,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3159,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"""Won't you let me take her home, Mrs. Seymour?"" said Miss Peters. ""I"

3163,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3164,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"Mrs. Seymour was very glad, but wondered if Rosie would like it, as she"
3165,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,was rather shy; but the little girl saw that it was the only arrangement
3166,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"by which her brothers could have all their fun, so she went with Miss"
3167,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"Peters. She was a very grave little visitor, but Miss Peters was so kind"
3168,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"that Rosie could not be shy for long; and then there was so much, so"
3169,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"_very_ much, to see! The house was like a museum, the conservatory a"
3170,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"fairyland, and the garden a paradise of loveliness."
3171,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3172,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"The showers all passed away, and Rosie could run about on the terraces,"
3173,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,where there were so many flowers that Miss Peters told her she might
3174,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"pick what she liked, and Rosie made a very pretty bunch to take home,"
3175,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,which pleased her; and pleasanter still was Miss Peters's kiss as she
3176,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"said, looking at the modest little nosegay, ""I am glad to see that you"

3181,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,But what Rosie enjoyed most of all was that Miss Peters came out with
3182,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"her, and, calling Jacob, the old gardener, she went down to the lake and"
3183,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"told him to get the boat ready, and then they went for a delightful row"
3184,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,on the clear water. Rosie _was_ happy then; she did not want Miss Peters
3185,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"to talk to her, and was very glad that the lady had brought a book,"
3186,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"though she did not read much of it, for she was steering."
3187,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3188,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"The only time Rosie did speak was when the great swan went gliding by,"
3189,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"and, lifting his wings, began to hiss at the boat in a rather alarming"
3190,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"manner. Then Rosie did touch Miss Peters's arm, asking, ""Will he hurt"

3192,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3193,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"""No, dear; but we will not go very near that bank, as he has a nest"

3197,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3198,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"Altogether Rosie passed a very happy day, and Miss Peters was so pleased"

3200,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"room that opened into the conservatory, she brought the child home, she"
3201,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,"kissed her, saying, ""Remember, Rosie, you must come and see me again. I"

3203,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,
3204,ROSIE'S DISAPPOINTMENT.,Rosie laughed and shook her head.

3219,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,make friends with us; but we told him there were enough of us without
3220,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"him, and then he would go away, but only to come back another day and"
3221,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,try again.
3222,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,
3223,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,When the spring weather came this year we made a delightful plan with
3224,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"the Browns that on Saturday we would go into the park, which was a mile"
3225,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"off, and have games under the trees. When Saturday came it was a lovely"
3226,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"day; so soon after breakfast we started out, all seven of us, with our"
3227,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"dinners in our pockets. Willie Brown had the drum, and I had the"
3228,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"trumpet, and a fine noise we made, almost frightening our little Sissy,"
3229,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"who had to come because Mother was busy, and Bessie was minding Sissy,"
3230,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,and we couldn't have any fun without Bessie. Charlie put on an old
3231,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"ragged coat, because Mother says he destroys everything; but Arthur and"
3232,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"Patty Brown looked very nice, and we made Patty the queen, and we were"
3233,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,her band playing to her.
3234,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,
3235,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,Then all at once Jim Batson came out from among the trees with his dog
3236,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"(who was held by a string because of the game), and when we saw them we"
3237,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,all shouted at Jim to go away. Bessie _did_ ask me if it didn't seem
3238,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"unkind; but we wouldn't listen to her and sent him away, telling him not"
3239,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,to sneak about near us. So he went off without a word.
3240,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,
3241,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"We weren't very happy after that, for Arthur turned cross, and wouldn't"
3242,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,speak to any one; but the worst of all was when Willie dropped one of
3243,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,the drumsticks into the river as we were crossing the plank. The river
3244,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"is very deep in parts, and none of us could swim, so we could only"
3245,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"follow the stick as it floated along, and hope that it might catch in"
3246,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,some weeds in a shallow part. But as we ran by the river we came on Jim
3247,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,and Pincher. Jim was sitting by the bank with his face hidden in his
3248,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"hands, and Pincher was just kissing him as hard as he could. Jim jumped"
3249,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"up and began to move away when he saw us, but stopped to ask what was"
3250,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"the matter when he saw Willie's face. As soon as he knew what it was, he"
3251,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"took the string off Pincher's neck, and throwing a stone at the stick"
3252,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"called, ""Hie, Pincher! fetch it out!"""
3253,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,
3254,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,We _did_ feel uncomfortable as we saw Pincher bring the drumstick to
3255,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"shore quite safely, but Bessie helped us out splendidly. She held out"
3256,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"her hand to Jim, and said, ""Thank you so much; we're all very sorry for"
3257,A PICNIC OF SEVEN.,"being so unkind. Please don't make us _more_ sorry by going away now."""

3429,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","""This must seem so strange to you,"" she said, ""that I feel I must"

3436,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","sorrow at having wounded Mrs. Braham's feelings. But Mrs. Braham said,"
3437,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","with a smile, that no apology was needed; and then, having seen her"
3438,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","visitor to the hall-door, she returned to the drawing-room, and took"
3439,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","Teddie on her knee. He was eleven years old, but that was still his"
3440,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",favorite seat. Very gently she put back the hair from his forehead and
3441,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","kissed him, and then suddenly she bent her head and burst into a fit of"
3442,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","weeping. Wise Teddie only pressed his arms more closely round her neck,"
3443,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","and said nothing till the tears began to stop. Then he whispered,--"

3445,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","""Won't you tell me all about it, mother?"""
3446,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",
3447,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","""Dear, this is the first real trouble you have known,"" she answered,"

3450,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",
3451,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","Then she told him how his father had become surety for a friend, and"

3453,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","place of the friend, if that friend should find himself unable to pay"
3454,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",it. Mr. Braham had made a promise to pay a large amount on this

3459,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",
3460,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","""No, dear; but we shall have to be very careful. I shall send Mary away"

3462,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","some of our rooms, and this year, at any rate, there will be no holiday"
3463,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","for us at the seaside."""
3464,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",
3465,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","""I don't mind it for myself, mother,"" said Teddie lovingly, ""I only mind"

3468,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","""But, darling, do you think you know what it means?"" she asked. ""No"

3470,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",this patiently and bravely? If you do you will carry out Christ's
3471,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","command: 'Bear ye one another's burdens,' for you will be helping your"

3474,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","""I will try;"" and though when Teddie raised his head from its"
3475,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","resting-place his eyes were wet, his face still wore a look of brave"
3476,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",resolve.
3477,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",
3478,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",It was a promise which he at once began to carry out in deed. It would
3479,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","be hard to part with his rabbits, hard to go to Gerald and say he would"
3480,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",accept his offer after the somewhat scornful way in which he had before
3481,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",refused it. But he did not know _how_ much the sacrifice would cost
3482,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","until he opened the hutch, and out came the little animals for their"
3483,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","evening meal. He took Stripe in his arms, and Brownie put her front paws"
3484,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","on his knee, as if jealous of the caresses Stripe was getting. He felt"
3485,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.","he could not let them go. But the feeling only lasted a few minutes, and"
3486,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",he hadn't a single regret when next day he placed two sovereigns in his
3487,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",mother's hand.
3488,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",
3489,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",She could only kiss him and thank him. Not on any account would she have
3490,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",told him that had she known his intention she should not have allowed
3491,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",him to carry it out.
3492,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",
3493,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",I am glad to say that in a few years Mr. Braham fully regained the money
3494,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",he had lost. But in better circumstances Teddie did not cease those
3495,"TEDDIE, THE HELPER.",loving acts of kindness and unselfishness which he tried so hard to

3668,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,A WALK IN COLOMBO.
3669,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3670,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3671,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Colombo, as most of my readers will remember, is in Ceylon, that"
3672,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,beautiful island lying to the south of India.
3673,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3674,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"You would think the people very funny, seeing them for the first time."
3675,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"The man in the picture, who is walking with the little English girl, is"
3676,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"a Hindu, and probably you have often seen pictures like him. Nearly all"
3677,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"the servants and laborers in Colombo are Hindus from Madras, but the"
3678,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"natives of the island are called Cingalese, and are very different in"
3679,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,every way.
3680,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3681,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"The men wear their hair in a big knob at the back like a woman, and on"
3682,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"the top of that is fastened a comb, shaped like a half-circle, with the"
3683,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,ends pointed to the face. The whole costume is a mixture of native and
3684,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"English fashions. The usual hat is a little round felt one, such as you"
3685,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"may see any day on boys at home, and which you have perhaps yourself."
3686,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"The next garment is also what you might expect to see on a man; that is,"
3687,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"a cloth coat, or rather shooting-jacket; but after that comes a long"
3688,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"flowing skirt, which you certainly would not see on any man or boy at"
3689,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,home. The Cingalese men bestow a good deal of attention on this skirt.
3690,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Poorer people have it made in white or blue calico, but others use very"
3691,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"handsome India stuffs, which must have cost a lot of money."
3692,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3693,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"The heat in Colombo is very great, and the roads are very dusty. No"
3694,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"wonder the people often feel hot and tired, and are very glad to lie"
3695,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,down and take a little sleep when they can. They also cool themselves by
3696,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"standing in some pools near the town. The cattle do the same, and you"
3697,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,can just see the heads of the buffaloes and of the men above the level
3698,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"of the water. They stand that way for an hour or two, perfectly still;"
3699,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,but the little children who go in keep jumping about and splashing each
3700,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,other.
3701,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3702,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,You may see in this picture the fruit shops in the native quarter of the
3703,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"town, and bunches of bananas or plantains hanging up. Other shops sell"
3704,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"grain, which the people chiefly live upon. It is nothing unusual to see"
3705,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,the grain merchant lying fast asleep on the top of his store of rice or
3706,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"other grain. Outside many houses stands a wooden bedstead, and the old"
3707,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,people lie there asleep a great part of the day. The Cingalese are said
3708,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"to be very kind to old people, which is a very good trait in their"
3709,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"character. I wish they were a little kinder to their animals, but they"
3710,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,never seem to think that poor bullocks have any feeling at all. The
3711,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"carts in Colombo are drawn by bullocks, and they have a very hard time"
3712,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,of it. The rope used as reins is passed through a hole bored through
3713,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"their nostrils, and a heavy beam of wood rests on their backs. Worse"
3714,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"still, they are branded all over, not only with the owner's initials,"
3715,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,but with all sorts of fanciful ornamental figures; the cruel people who
3716,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,do this never caring what the unfortunate animals suffer while it is
3717,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,being done. The houses are often painted outside with animals and birds
3718,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,in the brightest colors; and some of these wall pictures are so absurd
3719,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,that strangers always stop to look and laugh at them.
3720,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3721,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""Ho! 'Hamed! _dear_ 'Hamed, you _will_ let me ride Prince Albert Victor,"
3722,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"won't you?"""
3723,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3724,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"The speaker was a little, brown, black-eyed boy, with dark tangled locks"
3725,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"under his old red fez, and clad in a dirty white cotton garment, who was"
3726,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,coaxing a tall Egyptian lad in a very irresistible way. Children coax
3727,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"much the same all the world over, to get their way, be they white or"
3728,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,black or brown. In this case little Hassan got his. And what was it he
3729,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,wanted?
3730,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3731,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"'Hamed, an Egyptian donkey-boy, was leaving home early in the morning as"
3732,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"usual, leaving his dim, dirty quarters in the native part of Cairo for"
3733,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"the European part of the city. And with him, as usual, was going Prince"
3734,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,Albert Victor.
3735,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3736,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Prince Albert Victor was only a donkey, a very nice, strong, well-fed"
3737,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Egyptian donkey, but nothing more, in spite of his grand name. But all"
3738,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,the Cairo donkeys which stand about the streets for hire have very grand
3739,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,names given to them by their owners to attract the European tourists.
3740,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"For instance, some boy will call his donkey by an American name--such as"
3741,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Washington, or Yankee-doodle--that the American travellers may fancy"
3742,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"him. Another, with a view to a Frenchman or an Englishman, will christen"
3743,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,his animal President Carnot or Lord Salisbury. 'Hamed had called his
3744,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Prince Albert Victor; for he found a royal name very popular, not only"
3745,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"with English travellers, but with the red-coated British soldiers who"
3746,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,pervade the streets of Cairo.
3747,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3748,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Now, little Hassan wanted, as usual, to ride Albert Victor down from his"
3749,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,home to his habitual waiting-place in front of one of the big hotels. It
3750,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,was such a delight to him to thrust his bare brown feet into the
3751,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"stirrup-leathers (his legs were too short to reach the stirrups), and,"
3752,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"clutching Albert Victor's bridle, and sitting very erect, to fancy"
3753,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,himself very grand indeed as they slowly passed down the dim alleys of
3754,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,their native town.
3755,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3756,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"It was a glorious day, such a blue sky, such a bright sun, so different"
3757,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"from winter in our dull, foggy England, that little Elfreda felt very"
3758,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,happy as she looked out of the hotel window on such new and strange
3759,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,sights.
3760,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3761,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""It seems like stories out of the Bible, mother,"" she cried, gazing at"
3762,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"the Eastern dresses, the queer-looking figures, the donkeys, and the"
3763,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,camels. For Elfreda and her mother had only lately come to Cairo for the
3764,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"winter, for the mother's health, and everything was still wonderful to"
3765,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,her.
3766,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3767,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""Where shall we go to-day?"" she added. ""To the mosques, or through the"
3768,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"bazaars, or out a long way into the country by the river? Quick, mother;"
3769,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"let me call some donkey-boys, and let's be off."""
3770,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3771,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""There's that little tiny boy just ridden up, he who comes every morning"
3772,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"with the big one! I _must_ have his donkey again!"""
3773,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3774,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"And Elfreda clapped her hands, and cried, ""'Hamed!"""
3775,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3776,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"There were fifty 'Hameds, donkey-boys (it is a very common name). But"
3777,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"though several came up, they all knew that it was our friend who was"
3778,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,called.
3779,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3780,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""See,"" said little Hassan (he had jumped off Albert Victor and stood"
3781,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"behind him), ""there is the same 'zit'"" (English lady) ""clapping again,"
3782,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,she who hired you yesterday and the day before; and with her the little
3783,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"'zit' with the long hair. Hurry, 'Hamed! I'm sure she means you!"""
3784,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3785,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Hassan was right. In a few minutes Elfreda was mounted on Albert Victor,"
3786,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,and was patting his gray neck and long ears.
3787,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3788,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""He's _such_ a nice donkey, mother; heaps nicer than the dull, tired"
3789,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,donkeys I ride when we go to the seaside! He's got some go about him!
3790,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Why, he can canter almost as nicely as my pony at home, and 'Hamed has"
3791,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,to run to keep up with him! I should just like to take him back to
3792,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"England for a pet!"""
3793,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3794,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""I wonder what little Hassan would say,"" remarked her mother. ""He would"
3795,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"miss his daily ride on Albert Victor, and I don't think he would be very"
3796,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"happy in England in that costume. The village boys would jeer at him!"""
3797,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3798,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"""Well, perhaps the pony _is_ the best to ride at home, and Albert Victor"
3799,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"here,"" considered Elfreda; ""for certainly it _is_ very crowded and noisy"
3800,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"for any one not used to it,"" she added."
3801,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,
3802,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"For they were now in the native town, on their way to the shops, there"
3803,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,to bargain for Oriental curiosities. It was a ceaseless delight to
3804,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"Elfreda. She bought slippers for her uncle, a fan for her little sister"
3805,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"at home, and queer pots to decorate the schoolroom. Elfreda would have"
3806,A WALK IN COLOMBO.,"lingered longer, but it was now time to return to lunch at the hotel."

3963,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""I wonder if I could trust you children to go out alone this morning,"""
3964,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"said Mrs. Ferrars. ""I don't want to deprive nurse of her holiday, and I"

3966,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3967,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Oh! yes, mother,"" cried Dolly and Ralph together. ""May we go on the"

3969,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3970,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Well, it is just because I said you might, that I feel a little"
3971,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"anxious,"" said Mrs. Ferrars, stroking Dolly's fair hair. ""My Dolly"
3972,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"sometimes forgets mother's wishes for her own; still, as it is the last"

3974,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3975,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Of course, mother,"" said Ralph confidently, ""I'll take care of Dolly;"
3976,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"all the boys will be there, and heaps of people we know."""
3977,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3978,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""You won't skate beyond the point?"" said mother; ""never mind if the"
3979,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"others do or not; remember you are both on your honor."""
3980,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3981,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Full of delight, the children bounded off, skates in hand, and soon"
3982,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,arrived at the gay scene by the frozen lake. The ice was already crowded
3983,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"with skaters, big and little, and Ralph and Dolly espied two or three of"
3984,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,their friends as busy as themselves fastening on skates.
3985,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3986,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"The band played, the sun shone, and merry voices and laughter echoed"

3990,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"your sister, I'll take mine."""
3991,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3992,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"They all four flew across the ice, backwards and forwards again and"
3993,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"again, Frank and his sister winning at every turn."
3994,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3995,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Now change partners,"" said Frank, pairing off with Dolly, ""perhaps that"

3997,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
3998,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""I'm rather tired of going over the same road,"" said Dolly presently, as"
3999,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"she and Frank stood resting, while the other two ran a short race by"
4000,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"themselves. ""It looks so lovely out there. A broad sheet of ice without"
4001,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"any one on it, and all the trees at the foot of the terrace bending over"
4002,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"the lake. See, Frank, icicles are hanging from every twig; wouldn't you"
4003,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"like to go close to them?"""
4004,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4005,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,[Illustration: Ring Happy Bells Across the Snow]
4006,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4007,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Perhaps it isn't safe,"" replied Frank. ""No one seems to venture so far;"
4008,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"I shouldn't wonder if the ice were thin."""
4009,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4010,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""But our weight would be nothing on such a great space,"" urged Dolly. ""I"
4011,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"don't mean far off, only just beyond the point."""
4012,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4013,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Mother's words came back to her, but mother did not know. She was not"
4014,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"there to see how beautiful it all was, and of course Dolly did not mean"
4015,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,to run into danger.
4016,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4017,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,They began skating near the point. Again Dolly turned towards the
4018,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,terrace.
4019,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4020,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Oh, Frank! I must,"" she said. ""I see a long icicle like a sword with a"
4021,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"hilt; it's on a low branch--you can reach it for me."" She sped away, and"
4022,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Frank followed. In a moment they were side by side, and close to the"
4023,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"coveted icicle. As Frank raised himself to grasp it, he saw a thin"
4024,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,stream of water welling up from beneath the ice on to the bank. He
4025,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"seized Dolly's hand. ""Back, back!"" he cried wildly. ""The ice is giving,"
4026,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"we shall go in."" Away they fled. The ice creaked, but their weight was"
4027,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"light, and once more the point was gained in safety."
4028,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4029,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Dolly,"" said Ralph, hurrying up to his sister, ""have you forgotten what"
4030,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"mother said?"""
4031,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4032,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""No,"" replied Dolly, trying to laugh, though really ready to cry after"
4033,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"the fright she had undergone; ""but mother isn't here to see the icicles."
4034,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"I wanted one for her, and--"""
4035,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4036,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""We are on our honor,"" said Ralph, ""and I trusted you too, when you went"
4037,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"off with Frank."""
4038,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4039,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Dolly's tears began to fall. ""I won't tell tales of you,"" said Ralph."
4040,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Perhaps I am partly to blame, I ought not to have left you. Come and"
4041,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"skate with me, now."""
4042,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4043,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""I don't want to. I'll go home,"" said Dolly."
4044,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4045,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,Mother did not come back to lunch. She sent round a note to say she was
4046,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"staying with Lily; and by and by when she returned, her heart was so"
4047,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,full of sorrow for the suffering child that she forgot to ask about the
4048,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"morning's pleasure. If Dolly was silent, mother thought it was from"
4049,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,sympathy with herself.
4050,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4051,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,The next day school began. All thoughts of skating were banished; there
4052,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"was a prize to be fought for, and Dolly had set her heart on winning it."
4053,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4054,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,Somehow the spirit that had hitherto animated her now failed. The world
4055,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,seemed all out of tune. Again and again she was on the point of
4056,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"confessing her wrong-doing, as mother bent above her for a good-night"
4057,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"kiss. But weeks passed, and still the words remained unspoken. Ralph"
4058,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,never mentioned the ice; yet Dolly fancied he had loved her less since
4059,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,that morning.
4060,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4061,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""You musn't be too anxious about the prize, Dolly, darling,"" said her"
4062,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"mother, noticing the tired face, ""or I am afraid you will fall ill from"
4063,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,worry. I am quite glad to think the breaking-up party is to-morrow.
4064,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Mind, dear, I shall not be disappointed if you fail. I can trust my"
4065,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"child, and I know she has done her best."""
4066,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4067,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Dolly flushed crimson. Her mother trusted her, and imagined she knew"
4068,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,every thought of her childish heart. How little mother knew the misery
4069,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,Dolly was enduring!
4070,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4071,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,All was excitement at the school. The prize-giving only took place once
4072,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"a year, and many and great were the hopes and fears on that eventful"
4073,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,day. Some girls were of opinion that Dolly would carry off the coveted
4074,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"prize, others that she had lost ground of late, and failed utterly."
4075,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Dolly, quite aware of her shortcomings, was yet vaguely longing for"
4076,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"success. Her rival in the class was older and cleverer than herself, but"
4077,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"without the perseverance that characterized Dolly, therefore Dolly hoped"
4078,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,on until the prize-giving began.
4079,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4080,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Everything passed as in a dream, until Dolly's class was mentioned, when"
4081,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Miss Danvers, the head mistress, in a short speech declared that the"
4082,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"prize had been won, after a severe struggle, by Lucy Trevor. At the same"
4083,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"time she was giving a special prize, because of the good conduct and"
4084,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,perfect uprightness and truth of the unsuccessful competitor. This prize
4085,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"she awarded to Dolly Ferrars. She held up a beautiful Bible, bound in"
4086,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,white vellum.
4087,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4088,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""This is the prize of honor,"" she said."
4089,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4090,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,Dolly's heart stood still. She had forgotten her disappointment about
4091,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,the class prize in an overwhelming sense of shame.
4092,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4093,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Go up, Dolly,"" said mother proudly."
4094,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4095,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""I can't,"" said Dolly. ""I--I--"""
4096,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4097,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Go on, darling,"" said mother, gently pushing her. And Dolly went."
4098,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4099,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"In silence she accepted the Bible, and laid it on her mother's knee."
4100,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4101,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""I am so tired,"" she said."
4102,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4103,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""We will go now,"" whispered mother. ""The excitement has been too much"
4104,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"for you."""
4105,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4106,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,They slipped quietly away and returned home.
4107,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4108,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""Mother!"" cried Dolly, as they were alone. ""Oh, mother dear, I can't"
4109,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"take that prize, I don't deserve it. I have failed in truth and honor. I"
4110,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"am so miserable!"""
4111,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4112,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"Mrs. Ferrars, bewildered at Dolly's words, soothed her while she poured"
4113,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,out the story of her conduct on the ice.
4114,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4115,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""And I have no right to the prize,"" she said. ""What shall I do?"""
4116,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,
4117,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"""We will return it to Miss Danvers,"" said mother, gently; ""at least for"
4118,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"a time."" She looked very pale and sad. ""But, darling,"" she added, as she"
4119,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"folded Dolly in her arms, ""if you are really sorry and have through"
4120,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"repentance learned to conquer in the fight between right and wrong, you"
4121,THE PRIZE OF HONOR.,"are still a winner of the true prize of honor!"""

4169,A LABOR OF LOVE.,
4170,A LABOR OF LOVE.,"Claude could not but remember, for it was only yesterday that the"

4177,A LABOR OF LOVE.,
4178,A LABOR OF LOVE.,"""No, thank you,"" said the woman, looking gratefully at her little"

4180,A LABOR OF LOVE.,undress--and with tucked-up petticoats and huge sun-bonnet was supposed

4202,A LABOR OF LOVE.,"she toiled bravely to and fro, and Claude, who would not help at first,"

4255,A SPARROW STORY.,I and my little sisters are very fond of the sparrows who come to our

4421,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4422,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,On the side of one of the vine-clad hills of Italy dwelt a poor man with
4423,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"a large family. Though he was a hard-working man, he could only earn"
4424,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"enough to poorly support his children, and to give them an education was"
4425,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"beyond his power. He was an intelligent man, and though he had grown up"
4426,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"without even learning to read, he wanted his children to have the"
4427,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"advantages of schools and books, and he decided to seek for them a home"
4428,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,in America. He saved all the money he could from his meagre earnings to
4429,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"pay the expense of the voyage. It was a hard struggle, and there were"
4430,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,many days of stern self-denial and stringent economy ere the required
4431,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"amount could be obtained. When one has an earnest purpose, and bends his"
4432,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"energies to accomplish it, he is quite sure of success. It was thus with"
4433,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,this Italian family. Both father and mother were united in carrying out
4434,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"one fixed purpose,--to give their four children the advantages of a land"
4435,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"of free schools,--and though their struggles were hard, yet they were"
4436,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"working for their loved ones, and love lightens heavy burdens. There"
4437,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,always comes pleasure from what is done for the benefit of others.
4438,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4439,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"When all was ready they embarked from Genoa one evening, as the sunset"
4440,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,sent a radiant glow over mountain and valley.
4441,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4442,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,Silvio and Francesco were the youngest of the four children. The two
4443,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"eldest boys, like their parents, were sad at leaving their youthful"
4444,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"companions, and sat in the stern of the ship and watched the receding"
4445,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"hills till the rosy light faded, and darkness shut out from view their"
4446,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,native land forever.
4447,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4448,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"Silvio was nine years old, and Francesco two years younger. They did not"
4449,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"realize the journey which was before them, nor did they regret at"
4450,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,leaving. They were charmed with the novelty of the scenes around them.
4451,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"They watched the sailors in their duties about the ship, and listened to"
4452,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,the captain's stern orders. The harbor was gay with the lights of the
4453,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"many crafts, large and small, which were gliding about over the placid"
4454,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,surface of the gulf. So quiet were the waters that one would never dream
4455,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"that they could ever be ruffled, or cause the voyager discomfort. As"
4456,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,their ship glided out of the placid Gulf of Genoa into the Mediterranean
4457,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"Sea all on board were anticipating a quick and prosperous voyage, and a"
4458,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,safe landing on the bright shores of America.
4459,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4460,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"Alas, how uncertain is the future! A terrific storm arose when within a"
4461,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,few days' sail of the American coast. The masts and rudder were carried
4462,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"away by the wind, and the hulk then drifted at the mercy of the waves."
4463,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,The captain and several of the crew were washed overboard in the first
4464,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"encounter with the gale, and the lifeboat, which many of the passengers"
4465,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"took when it was believed the ship was sinking, was swamped, and all in"
4466,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"it lost. A few others remained on the hulk, and stayed on deck in hopes"
4467,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,to signal some passing vessel which had outridden the storm. One by one
4468,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"these were swept overboard, or died from exposure. Silvio and Francesco"
4469,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,were so small that they were not allowed on deck. When the storm
4470,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"commenced they were sleeping in the forecastle, in the berth of a kind"
4471,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,old sailor who had given them the use of it. His dog was their sleeping
4472,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,companion by night and playfellow by day. These three were secured below
4473,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"during the storm, and were forgotten during the excitement and distress"
4474,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,on board. The parents of the boys were swept overboard on the first
4475,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"night of the storm, and their brothers were lost in the lifeboat, and"
4476,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,their old sailor friend died from exposure and over-exertion on the
4477,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,second day of the storm. Thus they were bereft of both kindred and
4478,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"friend, and, though they were unconscious of their situation, they were"
4479,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"drifting upon the ocean on a wave-tossed bark, with no living companion"
4480,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,but the sailor's dog.
4481,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4482,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"Three days thus they drifted on the merciless ocean, wondering why they"
4483,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,were left alone in the forecastle; and when they called for help all the
4484,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,reply was the dashing of the waves against the shattered ship.
4485,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4486,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"Fortunately, a large steamer which had withstood the storm saw the"
4487,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"shattered hulk drifting upon the waves, and sent men on board to rescue"
4488,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"any who might be found alive. All had been swept away, and desolation"
4489,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"reigned on deck. To their surprise, on opening the forecastle they found"
4490,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,the two boys and the sailor's dog.
4491,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4492,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,These helpless and homeless ones they took to the ship. Sad indeed were
4493,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,they when they began to realize that their parents and brothers were
4494,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"lost. They had no kindred or friends, and knew not a word of the"
4495,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,language of the Americans who were upon the steamer. They shed many sad
4496,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"tears when the feelings of their loneliness settled upon them, and they"
4497,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"wished themselves in their own country, where a language was spoken"
4498,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,which they could understand.
4499,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4500,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"There is always sunshine behind the clouds, and their shadows were"
4501,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"dispelled by a kind gentleman upon the steamer, who said he would care"
4502,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,for them and give them a home.
4503,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4504,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"He commenced to teach them to speak English while on the voyage, and"
4505,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"amused them with various sports and games. Silvio, being the eldest,"
4506,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"learned quicker than his little brother, but as soon as he had learned"
4507,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,he taught Francesco.
4508,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4509,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,When the steamer landed the kind gentleman sent them to board for a
4510,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,while with a family from their own country who could speak both English
4511,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"and Italian, where they soon learned to talk in both languages."
4512,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4513,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"Silvio was a good object-teacher, and gave his little brother lessons."
4514,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4515,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,He would introduce some game or sport as a means of communicating
4516,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,instruction. It was pleasing to see them together. They would sit by the
4517,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"fire in the Italian's cottage, with the old sailor's dog, which the"
4518,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,gentleman who had befriended the children said should not be taken from
4519,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"them, and Silvio would teach his brother."
4520,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4521,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"They learned to play ""cratch cradle,"" and when they did this the names"
4522,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,of every thing used were learned. When one is learning a new language it
4523,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"is word by word; so in this game they learned to count, and to name the"
4524,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"words, such as hand, finger, string, cross, and others that suggested"
4525,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,themselves in the course of the game. Some children call this game
4526,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"""cat's cradle,"" but it should be ""cratch cradle."" A cratch is a"
4527,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,cross-legged crib from which cattle are fed. It is also the shape of a
4528,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"cradle, or child's sleeping-crib, and, as the strings take this shape"
4529,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"upon the fingers, the game has received that name."
4530,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,
4531,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"These boys learned very rapidly, and the gentleman who had befriended"
4532,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"them soon took them from the Italian's cottage, and sent them to the"
4533,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,best schools in America. Both became distinguished scholars. Silvio is
4534,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"now a celebrated artist, and Francesco a musician whose vocal and"
4535,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"instrumental acquirements have charmed the largest audiences, and"
4536,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,received the highest praise of the world. Both have visited their native
4537,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"country, and have pursued their studies among their own countrymen, but"
4538,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,they have never heard of any of their own kindred. The gentleman who
4539,SILVIO AND FRANCESCO.,"befriended them still lives to see the good results of his kind deed,"

4557,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"""Eh, bless her, so she do!"" returned a feeble voice from the bed in the"
4558,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"corner of the kitchen. ""It's a brave little lass, that it is! I'd sooner"
4559,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"trust her than Tom, for all he's three years older."""
4560,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4561,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"Grandmother gave a reluctant consent, and forth went the little"
4562,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"milkmaid, her bucket on her arm, and her dog Gypsy jumping about and"
4563,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"inviting her to have a race with him. Play was a very good thing, and"
4564,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"Susie dearly loved a romp, but this morning she shook her head, and told"
4565,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,Gypsy he must wait until her task was safely over. She was very proud of
4566,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"Grandfather's confidence in her, and made up her mind to deserve it."
4567,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4568,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,Susie looked like a part of the bright May morning as she tripped gayly
4569,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"down the pathway to the brook, brushing the dew off the grass and"
4570,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"flowers with her bare little white feet, and singing a gay"
4571,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"""good-morning"" to the birds fluttering in and out of the bushes."
4572,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4573,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"A kind little girl was Susie, loving all the living creatures about her"
4574,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"moorland home, and loved by them. The birds knew better than to come"
4575,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"within reach of Tom, but they hardly paused in their busy nest-building"
4576,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"as Susie passed by; only singing a little more gayly than before, which"
4577,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"was their way of welcoming her, so Susie said."
4578,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4579,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,Grandfather's cottage was built on the top of a steep field. At the
4580,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"bottom a bubbling, noisy little brook went tumbling and bustling merrily"
4581,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"over the stones, filling the sweet, warm air with a cheery song of its"
4582,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,own. A plank served as a bridge across the stream; and as Susie walked
4583,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"steadily over it she noticed a fat, motherly old duck nestling down"
4584,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,amongst the ferns and dock-leaves on the bank. Mother Duck uttered a
4585,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"startled and indignant ""Quack, quack,"" as Gypsy jumped over her head and"
4586,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"dashed headlong into the cool, bright water."
4587,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4588,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"""Ah, Mrs. Duck,"" cried Susie merrily, ""I see now where your eggs go! I"
4589,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"shall pay you a visit presently; I can't stop now, because I am going"
4590,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"a-milking."""
4591,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4592,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,The old duck looked after her with quite an air of understanding all
4593,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"about it, and gravely watched her run on towards the field where Daisy"
4594,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,the cow stood waiting at the gate. Tom had forgotten all about
4595,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"milking-time, but Mistress Daisy had good reasons of her own for liking"
4596,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,punctuality in such matters. So she poked her long white nose through
4597,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"the bars of the gate, and greeted Susie with a long, doleful complaint"
4598,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,of the sad way in which she had been neglected that morning.
4599,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4600,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"Perhaps it was Daisy's reproachful ""Moo"" which first made the little"
4601,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"maid conscious that she had forgotten the milking-stool, but she now"
4602,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,decided to do without it. The good old cow's temper must not be tried by
4603,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"any further delay, so down she knelt in the cool, dewy grass, and,"
4604,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"carefully fixing the pail, began her task."
4605,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4606,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"She found it not so easy as she expected, for milking requires practice,"
4607,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"and some strength of fingers, and Susie had little of either. But Daisy"
4608,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"was very good, and so the sweet, frothy milk rose higher and higher in"
4609,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"the little pail, until at length the task was done. Daisy showed she"
4610,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,thought so by suddenly beginning to walk away. The pail had a narrow
4611,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"escape then, but Susie got it safely out of the way, and began her"
4612,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,homeward walk. Very steadily she carried the pail to the brook. There a
4613,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,surprise awaited her; while she had been milking some one had pulled
4614,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"away the plank, and thrown it down on the opposite bank. Wet feet are no"
4615,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,hardship to little girls who wear no shoes and stockings. Susie soon
4616,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"tucked up her dress, and walked carefully through the bubbling stream,"
4617,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"taking good heed of the stones at the bottom. She got across safely, and"
4618,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"began to climb the steep, narrow path leading to the cottage. On either"
4619,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"side the grass was long, sometimes almost meeting across the path. All"
4620,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"in a moment her foot caught in some hidden trap, and down she fell! Alas"
4621,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"for the poor little milkmaid! Her pail was upset, and the milk--the"
4622,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"precious milk--ran hither and thither amongst the primroses and daisies,"
4623,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,and finally trickled down into the brook.
4624,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4625,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"""This comes of sending babies a-milking,"" said Grandmother, who had seen"
4626,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"the disaster from the cottage door. ""Come in,"" she added crossly, as the"
4627,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"distressed little maid came slowly up the path. ""Thou'rt a bad, careless"
4628,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"lass, and shall have no breakfast. Catch me sending thee a-milking"
4629,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"again."""
4630,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4631,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"""Wait a bit, Grandmother,"" said the old man, in his feeble, quavering"
4632,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"voice. ""Did not I hear Tom say that he'd teach the little one to meddle"
4633,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,with his job? You must go down the path and see for yourself if it is
4634,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"not one of his tricks. Something must have tripped the child up."""
4635,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4636,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"Grandmother could not refuse to go down the path, but she went"
4637,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"unwillingly. Tom was her favorite, and she did not wish to find him out"
4638,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"in the wrong. But when she came to the milk-dyed spot, and found the"
4639,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"long grass tied together across the path, she could no longer deny that"
4640,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,the child in fault was not little Susie. As she slowly wended her way
4641,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"back to the cottage, she felt not only angry with naughty, idle Tom, but"
4642,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,grieved at her own lack of justice to the willing little milkmaid.
4643,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,
4644,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,Tom's unkind and revengeful conduct did not this time go unpunished; but
4645,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"his grandmother's over-indulgence had sadly spoilt his character, and"
4646,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,"although she strove hard to remedy the evil, it is doubtful if he will"
4647,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,ever learn to be as obedient and unselfish as his good little sister
4648,THE LITTLE MILKMAID.,Susie.

4655,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""I wish I could catch a bobolink,"" said Samuel."
4656,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4657,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""Let us try to-morrow and see if we cannot catch one in a box trap,"""
4658,MR. BOBOLINK.,said his brother Robert.
4659,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4660,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""That will be real fun,"" said little Maggie. And so the three children"
4661,MR. BOBOLINK.,"talked the matter over, and made plans for the morrow."
4662,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4663,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""You must help me in the morning,"" said their father. ""Samuel must drop"
4664,MR. BOBOLINK.,"the corn in the hills for the hired man to cover, Robert will drop the"
4665,MR. BOBOLINK.,"beans, and Maggie must put in the pumpkin-seed. We shall have it all"
4666,MR. BOBOLINK.,"done by ten o'clock, and then you can play the rest of the day. If a"

4668,MR. BOBOLINK.,"are very shy, and do not stop long in any one place."""
4669,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4670,MR. BOBOLINK.,"The next morning the sun rose radiantly in the eastern sky, and climbed"
4671,MR. BOBOLINK.,"up among the golden clouds, and all the early birds joined in a glad"
4672,MR. BOBOLINK.,song of welcome. The robin chanted from the lofty branches of the elm;
4673,MR. BOBOLINK.,"the bluebird, with plumage brighter than the bluest sky, glided in and"
4674,MR. BOBOLINK.,"out among the apple-trees, and enlivened the scene by its occasional"
4675,MR. BOBOLINK.,"joyous song; the red linnet whistled and chattered in the shrubbery, and"
4676,MR. BOBOLINK.,the sparrow chirped in the hedge. All around seemed full of life and
4677,MR. BOBOLINK.,joy.
4678,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4679,MR. BOBOLINK.,"The bobolink swung from the highest branches, and poured out his"
4680,MR. BOBOLINK.,ecstatic feelings in thrilling song.
4681,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4682,MR. BOBOLINK.,"The children went to the fields amid all this morning music, and tried"
4683,MR. BOBOLINK.,to translate the song of each bird into English.
4684,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4685,MR. BOBOLINK.,"The robin chanted, ""Kill him! cure him! Kill him! cure him! Give him"
4686,MR. BOBOLINK.,"physic!"""
4687,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4688,MR. BOBOLINK.,"Who he wanted treated in this manner they could not tell, but that"
4689,MR. BOBOLINK.,seemed to be the language of his song.
4690,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4691,MR. BOBOLINK.,"The voice of the linnet or bluebird could not be interpreted easily, but"
4692,MR. BOBOLINK.,"the bobolink spoke very plainly, and seemed personal in his remarks,"
4693,MR. BOBOLINK.,which were evidently intended for the eldest boy; for he said over and
4694,MR. BOBOLINK.,"over again, ""Samuel! Samuel!--Samuel, planting, planting. Samuel!"
4695,MR. BOBOLINK.,"Samuel! planting for bobolink! bobolink!"""
4696,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4697,MR. BOBOLINK.,"This chattering and singing were kept up all the forenoon, and the"
4698,MR. BOBOLINK.,children resolved that when their play-time came in the afternoon they
4699,MR. BOBOLINK.,"would set some traps and try to secure one of these saucy songsters, who"
4700,MR. BOBOLINK.,had been talking so much to Samuel during the forenoon.
4701,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4702,MR. BOBOLINK.,"Soon as dinner was over the three hurried off to the sheep pasture,"
4703,MR. BOBOLINK.,"where, among the maple-trees, a large flock of bobolinks were evidently"
4704,MR. BOBOLINK.,"resting a day or two on their journey towards Canada, that they might"
4705,MR. BOBOLINK.,feast on the scattered grains of an old wheat-field near by. The
4706,MR. BOBOLINK.,"children took a few handfuls of wheat, which they scattered upon the"
4707,MR. BOBOLINK.,"ground; and, as Maggie could sew better than the boys, she strung some"
4708,MR. BOBOLINK.,grains of wheat on a small thread. This was tied to a slender prop which
4709,MR. BOBOLINK.,"held up the cover of the trap, which was made by putting four blocks"
4710,MR. BOBOLINK.,together in the shape of a box. In it was a handful of wheat. When all
4711,MR. BOBOLINK.,was ready the children hid behind some shrubbery and watched and waited
4712,MR. BOBOLINK.,"the result. They whispered to each other, and laid plans concerning what"
4713,MR. BOBOLINK.,could be done with the bird after he was caught.
4714,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4715,MR. BOBOLINK.,"Samuel said, ""Sell him. I read of bobolinks being sold at bird-stores in"
4716,MR. BOBOLINK.,the city for two or three dollars each. We could get money enough to buy
4717,MR. BOBOLINK.,"snap-crackers and fireworks for next Fourth of July."""
4718,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4719,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""Oh! I wouldn't do that,"" said Robert."
4720,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4721,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""Nor I,"" said little Maggie. ""I should rather go without any money for"
4722,MR. BOBOLINK.,"Fourth of July. Let's keep him, and put him in Dicky's old cage, and"
4723,MR. BOBOLINK.,"teach him to sing."""
4724,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4725,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""Perhaps you are counting your game before 'tis caught,"" said Robert."
4726,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""There are no birds near your trap yet."""
4727,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4728,MR. BOBOLINK.,"Just then a large flock had discovered the scattered grain, and flew"
4729,MR. BOBOLINK.,down near the trap. Each one of the children watched in breathless
4730,MR. BOBOLINK.,"silence. Several birds entered the box, and chattered and feasted, but"
4731,MR. BOBOLINK.,"the cover did not fall, and the time the children were waiting in"
4732,MR. BOBOLINK.,"silence seemed very long. At length an old, strong bird caught up a"
4733,MR. BOBOLINK.,"grain attached to the string, and gave it a violent jerk. Out came the"
4734,MR. BOBOLINK.,"little prop, and down went the heavy cover, and a jolly old singer was"
4735,MR. BOBOLINK.,"entrapped. He screamed and fluttered, and his frightened companions flew"
4736,MR. BOBOLINK.,away over the distant meadow.
4737,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4738,MR. BOBOLINK.,"The children ran to the trap, delighted with the capture they had made,"
4739,MR. BOBOLINK.,and each one got down on his knees and peeped into the trap. Sure
4740,MR. BOBOLINK.,"enough, there was Mr. Bobolink. He had on his black dress-coat and white"
4741,MR. BOBOLINK.,"waistcoat and breeches, and a pretty yellow necktie. They all thought"
4742,MR. BOBOLINK.,"him very handsome, and they laid plans for having him put into a nice"
4743,MR. BOBOLINK.,"brass cage at the front of the house, where they could every day hear"
4744,MR. BOBOLINK.,"his cheerful song. They were all delighted with their prize, and"
4745,MR. BOBOLINK.,thoughts of much enjoyment went through their minds.
4746,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4747,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""Take him out carefully,"" said Robert, as Samuel knelt down to open the"
4748,MR. BOBOLINK.,box.
4749,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4750,MR. BOBOLINK.,"""Don't hurt him,"" said Maggie; and Samuel raised the cover to put in his"
4751,MR. BOBOLINK.,hand.
4752,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4753,MR. BOBOLINK.,"There was a flutter and a scream, and Mr. Bobolink flew away, and soared"
4754,MR. BOBOLINK.,"high into the air, and soon joined his travelling companions on their"
4755,MR. BOBOLINK.,way to Canada.
4756,MR. BOBOLINK.,
4757,MR. BOBOLINK.,"The children were much disappointed, and when they told their father he"

4795,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"Old Jones, the sexton, toiled slowly up to the Rectory one winter"
4796,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"morning. He had a sad tale to tell, and the ground was heavy with snow,"
4797,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,and poor old Jones's heart was full of a great sorrow.
4798,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4799,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"The Rectory lay cosily among the sheltering trees, and gleamed warm and"
4800,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"cheerful beneath the gloomy skies. Mr. Chillingworth, the Rector, was a"
4801,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"good man, and greatly beloved by the people in the parish of Redhall."
4802,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4803,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"Old Jones, as I have said, was the sexton; and he tried his best, with"
4804,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"very small success, to keep all the village boys in awe of him. He"
4805,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"always went, with them, by the name of ""old red Johnnie,"" for he wore a"
4806,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,red woollen comforter through winter's cold and summer's heat.
4807,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4808,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"He had a champion in one boy, however, called Toddie Banks; for you see"
4809,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"poor Toddie was an orphan, and old Jones had been very kind to him when"
4810,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"he was just a wee toddling laddie, had taken him to his own home, and"
4811,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"treated him like a son, for the old man had neither kith nor kin, wife"
4812,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"nor child, so Toddie was all of them put together to him."
4813,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4814,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"And now Toddie had been missing for a whole day and night, and Jones had"
4815,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"no doubt he had fallen over a precipice, or been lost in some deep"
4816,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"snowdrift, for, you must know, Toddie was a bit of a naturalist, and"
4817,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,used to take long walks in search of any curiosities he might find.
4818,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4819,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,The poor old man had never been in his bed the whole of the previous
4820,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"night, but had been searching everywhere, helped by some kindly"
4821,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,neighbors.
4822,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4823,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"When Mr. Chillingworth understood the whole story, he at once"
4824,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"volunteered to go in search of Toddie, accompanied by his splendid"
4825,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"Newfoundland dog, Neptune."
4826,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4827,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"""Cheer up, Jones,"" he said in his kindly way. ""Neptune and I will do our"

4830,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4831,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"Neptune was perfectly aware that he and his master were to find Toddie,"
4832,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,so he bounded on gayly before Mr. Chillingworth. They had not proceeded
4833,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"many yards before Neptune suddenly stopped, and, listening intently,"
4834,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,galloped furiously in the direction of a stream that in summer time was
4835,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"a favorite haunt of Toddie's. On reaching the water he stood still, and,"
4836,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"uttering a long, sorrowful howl, remained, evidently waiting for his"
4837,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,master.
4838,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,
4839,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"Mr. Chillingworth hastened up; and there was Toddie, lying to all"
4840,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,appearance quite dead. In scrambling up the river bank he had been
4841,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,apparently overcome by the deadly cold and sleep from which few ever
4842,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"waken to life again. He had a bunch of scarlet berries in his hand, and"
4843,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,it was pathetic to see the cold stiff fingers still clutching their
4844,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"treasure. Being so near the Rectory, Mr. Chillingworth just lifted the"
4845,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"lad and bore him rapidly to his house. What was his joy, after half an"
4846,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"hour's untiring effort to revive him, to see Toddie slowly open his"
4847,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"eyes, and, by the time old Jones and his neighbors reached the Rectory,"
4848,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,Toddie was able to sit up and relate his experiences. It was as the
4849,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"Rector thought; in reaching after the berries he fell, and remembered"
4850,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,nothing afterwards. Poor old Jones and Toddie were heroes ever after
4851,HOW TODDIE WAS FOUND.,"that, and I am glad to say the village boys ceased to call him ""old red"

4886,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""Has it!"" exclaimed Fred Norton, no less excited at the news than his"
4887,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"brother; ""then let's go down at once and have a look at it."""
4888,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4889,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"Off ran the two little fellows, and were soon in the village; and there,"
4890,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"sure enough, drawn up in a side street, was the van of a travelling"
4891,THE TINKER'S VAN.,tinker. The old horse had been taken out of the shafts and was standing
4892,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"patiently on one side, while the tinker's wife, with her baby in her"
4893,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"arms, walked slowly up and down, casting from time to time an anxious"
4894,THE TINKER'S VAN.,look up the street.
4895,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4896,THE TINKER'S VAN.,Her sunburnt face beamed with a hearty smile as the two boys rushed up
4897,THE TINKER'S VAN.,to her.
4898,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4899,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""Here you are, young gentlemen!"" she said, with evident delight; ""I was"
4900,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"looking out for you. I thought you'd see us go by; but my old man, he"
4901,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"says, 'Susan, what are you thinking of? Those young gentlemen have"
4902,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"forgotten you by this time, for it's six months more or less since we"
4903,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"last passed by here.'"""
4904,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4905,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""We haven't forgotten you,"" said little Ronald indignantly. ""How could I"
4906,THE TINKER'S VAN.,forget when you were so kind to me? I could not have got home that day I
4907,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"sprained my foot, and then your van came up, and you jumped out and"
4908,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"carried me in, and bathed my foot, and brought me home. Why--why--"""
4909,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"stammered the little fellow in his eagerness, ""I should be a _pig_ if I"
4910,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"forgot you."""
4911,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4912,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""Step inside, sirs,"" said the woman, quite confused by Ronald's"
4913,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"gratitude; ""I want you to see how beautiful the clock looks that your"
4914,THE TINKER'S VAN.,mamma gave me. It goes just splendid; my old man _is_ proud of it; it
4915,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"never loses a minute, and yet it gets many a jolt."""
4916,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4917,THE TINKER'S VAN.,The children needed no second invitation. The van was a paradise to
4918,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"them, and they ran up the steps and looked at everything, and everything"
4919,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"seemed charming. They longed to possess such a treasure, and thought"
4920,THE TINKER'S VAN.,the tinker and his wife must be the happiest of mortals.
4921,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4922,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""I should like to live here always,"" said Fred, as he and Ronald stood"
4923,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"at the door of the van and looked out at the scene around them. ""It's so"
4924,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"jolly free,"" continued the boy, ""so far better than always being in one"
4925,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"house; and the cat there, and the cocks and hens, and old Dobbin--I'd"
4926,THE TINKER'S VAN.,much rather look at things like that than at the maps and pictures on
4927,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"our schoolroom walls."""
4928,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4929,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""Ah! but you don't know all, sir,"" said the woman, shaking her head. ""I"
4930,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"was born in a van, and have always lived in one, but I don't want my"
4931,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"little laddie here to lead the life,"" and she danced the crowing baby in"
4932,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"her arms as she spoke. ""I hope, by and by, we shall have a little"
4933,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"cottage of our own and settle down, and my boy can go to school and"
4934,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"learn to read his Bible, which is more than his mother can do, for I"
4935,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"never had a day's schooling in my life."""
4936,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4937,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""Can't you read?"" said little Ronald in astonishment. ""I'll come every"
4938,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"day that you stay here and teach you. I'll begin to-night!"" and before"
4939,THE TINKER'S VAN.,another word could be said he had darted out of the van and was up the
4940,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"street and out of sight, returning in a very few minutes with a large"
4941,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"picture-book, out of which he himself had learned to read."
4942,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4943,THE TINKER'S VAN.,Ronald was a wise little fellow to have brought a picture-book; for such
4944,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"a work of art had never been seen by the woman before, and if reading"
4945,THE TINKER'S VAN.,was only looking at pictures like that she felt she might manage it
4946,THE TINKER'S VAN.,after all.
4947,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4948,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"She was by no means a stupid scholar, and Ronald was so earnest a little"
4949,THE TINKER'S VAN.,teacher that the progress made was really astonishing. The tinker found
4950,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"a good many jobs in the village, and stayed nearly a fortnight, and by"
4951,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"that time Susan could spell little words very nicely, and no longer read"
4952,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"a-s-s, donkey, as, misled by the picture, she had done at the beginning"
4953,THE TINKER'S VAN.,of the lessons.
4954,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4955,THE TINKER'S VAN.,Ronald's mother gave the woman a large print Bible with a great many
4956,THE TINKER'S VAN.,pictures in it; and when next year the tinker's van again visited the
4957,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"village, Susan was delighted to be able to exhibit her progress, and"
4958,THE TINKER'S VAN.,slowly and reverently she read the parable of the Lost Sheep.
4959,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4960,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"""I read that to my old man most nights,"" she said; ""his father was a"
4961,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"shepherd, and he knows all about sheep. Oh, Master Ronald!"" said the"
4962,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"woman, suddenly changing her tone, ""I do bless you for putting it into"
4963,THE TINKER'S VAN.,"my head to learn to read."""
4964,THE TINKER'S VAN.,
4965,THE TINKER'S VAN.,Certainly Ronald was a happy boy that day.

4973,A LITTLE MAN.,
4974,A LITTLE MAN.,"Bobby was not quite six years old, but he thought himself quite a man,"
4975,A LITTLE MAN.,"and a very strong man too. He was a sturdy little fellow, and as he"
4976,A LITTLE MAN.,"never caught cold, his mother allowed him to run about without shoes and"
4977,A LITTLE MAN.,stockings when the weather was warm and dry.
4978,A LITTLE MAN.,
4979,A LITTLE MAN.,Bobby's mother was always a little afraid of his being hurt. She had
4980,A LITTLE MAN.,"only two children--Lucy, who was twelve, and Bobby--and she was"
4981,A LITTLE MAN.,sometimes very anxious lest Bobby should come to some harm when he would
4982,A LITTLE MAN.,work among the men. She also forbade him the use of knives and all sharp
4983,A LITTLE MAN.,"instruments. This was a real grief to Bobby, as the men knew it, and"
4984,A LITTLE MAN.,"would sometimes tease him, and it was then so difficult to pretend to"
4985,A LITTLE MAN.,"himself that his knife wasn't in his pocket, as he could have done for"
4986,A LITTLE MAN.,his own satisfaction.
4987,A LITTLE MAN.,
4988,A LITTLE MAN.,"One day in the spring, when the laurel hedge was being cut, one of the"
4989,A LITTLE MAN.,"men offered to lend Bobby a knife, and, without a thought of his"
4990,A LITTLE MAN.,"mother's wishes, Bobby took it, and began cutting in a great hurry."
4991,A LITTLE MAN.,"Alas! after a few boughs had come off, Bobby tried to cut a thicker one,"
4992,A LITTLE MAN.,"which he had to hold down with his left hand, so that when the knife"
4993,A LITTLE MAN.,slipped he cut his third finger rather badly. He ran at once to Lucy
4994,A LITTLE MAN.,"with the knife in his hand, and then dropped it on the ground close to"
4995,A LITTLE MAN.,his bare toes. In his thoughtlessness he might have cut his foot also if
4996,A LITTLE MAN.,Mother had not come out and picked up the knife. She was more sorry than
4997,A LITTLE MAN.,"angry at Bobby's disobedience, but the boy was more careful to obey his"
4998,A LITTLE MAN.,"mother after that, and among the presents on his next birthday there was"
4999,A LITTLE MAN.,"a capital knife from Mother, but given on condition that at first it"
5000,A LITTLE MAN.,"should only be used when his father was present, and could show him what"
5001,A LITTLE MAN.,"ought to be done with it. Bobby is a very happy boy now, because no one"
5002,A LITTLE MAN.,"can tease him, as he has that precious knife of his very own."
