37,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
38,PREFACE.,
39,PREFACE.,
40,PREFACE.,It is unfortunately true that the terms education and culture are not
41,PREFACE.,"synonymous. Too often we find that the children in our public schools,"
42,PREFACE.,"while possessed of the one, are signally lacking in the other. This is"
43,PREFACE.,a state of things that cannot be remedied by teaching mere facts. The
44,PREFACE.,"Greeks, many years ago, found the true method of imparting the latter"
45,PREFACE.,grace and we shall probably not be able to discover a better one
46,PREFACE.,to-day. Their youths learned Homer and the other great poets as a part
47,PREFACE.,"of their daily tasks, and by thus constantly dwelling upon and storing"
48,PREFACE.,in their minds the noblest and most beautifully expressed thought in
49,PREFACE.,"their literature, their own mental life became at once refined and"
50,PREFACE.,strong.
51,PREFACE.,
52,PREFACE.,"The basis of all culture lies in a pure and elevated moral nature, and"
53,PREFACE.,"so noted an authority as President Eliot, of Harvard University, has"
54,PREFACE.,"said that the short memory gems which he learned as a boy in school,"
55,PREFACE.,have done him more good in the hour of temptation than all the sermons
56,PREFACE.,"he ever heard preached. A fine thought or beautiful image, once stored"
57,PREFACE.,"in the mind, even if at first it is received indifferently and with"
58,PREFACE.,"little understanding, is bound to recur again and again, and its"
59,PREFACE.,"companionship will have a sure, if unconscious, influence. The mind"
60,PREFACE.,that has been filled in youth with many such thoughts and images will
61,PREFACE.,surely bear fruit in fine and gracious actions.
62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,"To the teachers who are persuaded of this truth, the present"
64,PREFACE.,collection of poems has much to recommend it. The selections have been
65,PREFACE.,chosen both for their moral influence and for their permanent value as
66,PREFACE.,literature. They have been carefully graded to suit the needs of every
67,PREFACE.,class from the primary to the high school. Either the whole poem or a
68,PREFACE.,sufficiently long quotation has been inserted to give the child a
69,PREFACE.,complete mental picture.
70,PREFACE.,
71,PREFACE.,The teacher will thus escape the difficulty of choosing among a too
72,PREFACE.,"great abundance of riches, or the still greater one of finding for"
73,PREFACE.,"herself, with few resources, what serves her purpose. This volume has"
74,PREFACE.,a further advantage over other books of selections. It is so moderate
75,PREFACE.,in price that it will be possible to place it in the hands of the
76,PREFACE.,children themselves.
77,PREFACE.,
78,PREFACE.,"The compilers desire to thank Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Charles"
79,PREFACE.,"Scribner's Sons, Bowen, Merrill & Co., Whittaker & Ray Co., and"
80,PREFACE.,"Doubleday & McClure Co., for their kindness in permitting the use of"
81,PREFACE.,copyrighted material.

3192,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,
3193,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,"It was one by the village clock,"
